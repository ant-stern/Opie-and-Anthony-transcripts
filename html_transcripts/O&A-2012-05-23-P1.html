<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie and Jimmy discussing the absence of a co-host, speculating it was due to a birthday celebration.  They then transitioned to their new comedic video, "What Are We Waiting For?", featuring themselves, DeRosa, and Bobby Kelly as obnoxious Phil Collins fans. They detailed the filming challenges, including numerous takes caused by traffic and cold weather. Sam Roberts was mentioned as being on the phone.  The conversation took a dark turn, with graphic fantasies of violence and public humiliation,  including detailed scenarios of assaulting elderly people, disrupting weddings and recitals, and even more extreme acts like taking a police officer's gun.  They debated the distinction between fantasy and reality, framing these violent imaginings as a peculiar mental exercise.  This segued into a discussion on the ease of ruining versus improving someone's life,  extending to fantasies of disrupting public transport and air travel.  They then criticized the overuse of social media, particularly food pictures, and the obsession with documenting every moment,  devaluing genuine memories.  The segment concluded with Opie recounting a subway incident where he felt a black man was aggressively staring at him, leading to a discussion about unspoken social dynamics and perceived aggression in public settings, followed by speculation on crime and violence in public transportation.

The show continued with a segment focusing on two main topics: racially charged violent incidents in public places, including descriptions of physical assaults and the use of racial slurs (with a memorable quote: "This is for you, you white bitch. This is grape soda"), and their experiences with the medical profession and online interactions.  The hosts debated whether these incidents constituted hate crimes.  They contrasted their negative experiences with uncaring doctors focused on paperwork with a positive experience with "Dr. Steve." The discussion shifted to online criticism of Joe DeRosa's web series, "What Are We Waiting For?", which also featured Anthony Cumia in a cameo. DeRosa, who was a guest in the studio,  detailed his strategies for handling online abuse, ranging from angry responses to blocking users. The hosts shared similar anecdotes.  They also mentioned an upcoming Bill Burr comedy bit to be played later in the show and Jim Nortonâ€™s humorous encounter with a woman and her jealous boyfriend at a comedy club.


The next segment heavily featured dating experiences, focusing on negative female behavior and the discomfort of such encounters, along with discussions on paying for dates and the expectation of reciprocity.  Anthony's anxieties, childhood experiences, and efforts to avoid appearing "gay" were also discussed at length. The segment included repetitive declarations of dislike ("I didn't like that either") regarding a woman's behavior, a humorous bit about a poorly photoshopped birthday tribute on Fox News, and an anecdote where Joe DeRosa's father assaulted a man who made a sexual advance toward Joe. A raunchy promo for a Bailey J. podcast was also included, and the hosts discussed their communication preferences, favoring texting over calls.  Joe DeRosa was the only named guest in studio; "Sam" was mentioned as working the board.

A later segment involved recollections and dissection of stand-up comedy experiences, particularly performing for Black audiences,  and strategies for navigating these performances, ranging from pandering to genuine honesty.  The hosts then imagined their lives if they hadn't been successful, providing vivid and crude descriptions of their imagined less-fortunate lives, including their relationships, finances, and living conditions.  They joked about their perceived lack of self-esteem contrasting with their professional confidence. The conversation expanded to speculation on the alternate timelines of other guests and characters from *Welcome Back, Kotter*.  Personal anecdotes, including experiences with a comedy bag, led to discussions of current lifestyles, possessions, and relationships, punctuated by vulgar language and sexually suggestive comments.  They also promoted their podcast and web series. The final part discussed the difficulty of maintaining relationships and their partner preferences, again interspersed with vulgarity and sexually explicit humor. A brief, unexplained metallic sound was heard during the broadcast.


The final segment featured graphic discussions about sex, primarily revolving around Bailey J., a transgender woman. The hosts and possibly Jay Moore (mentioned in a casino bathroom anecdote) engaged in explicit discussions of hypothetical sexual acts with Bailey J., using vulgar language and explicit descriptions. Pictures of Bailey J. were shown and discussed at length, focusing on her physique and genitalia.  The conversation included tangents about strip clubs, an upcoming book, and a host's desire to have a child.  The segment concluded with promotions for upcoming stand-up shows, the book "Cheat," a web series, and sponsor Quiznos.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  He doesn't feel a great impression of himself.  Like he choked, I think.  He's supposed to be like, good morning. Welcome aboard.  You know what he sounds like?  He sounds like when South Park catchphrases started to get shitty.  And it's like, screw you guys, I'm going home. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, the exaggerated version of what it's supposed to be.  Good morning. Good morning.  Well, regardless, good morning. Good morning.  Open an empty program.  I hope he's off today.  It's his birthday or something.  Was he eating cake or something?  Exactly, Chippa.  He's eating cake.  Yeah, or she's blowing out a bunch of 200 candles or something.  I don't think there's that many chips.  Why not?  Anything else?  Oh, I did birthday humor.  Yeah. 
[00:01:00]  Humor.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, so it's just me and Jimmy.  Yes.  And the guys, of course.  I think, is DeRosa coming in later?  Yep.  And Bobby Kelly?  I believe so.  Wow.  That was funny, your thing with him.  I watched it.  Oh, yes.  It was very funny.  It was good.  Yes, yes.  I wanted to talk to Joe about that.  That was definitely fun.  Uh, it's, it's like, uh, wait, is it, is it, what are we waiting for? 
[00:01:30]  What are we waiting, what the fuck is it called?  I have no idea.  Well, I think it's what are we waiting for.  It's a series.  I have no idea.  No, I, uh, that was fun.  Joe approached me to do this because, um, he was over at my house once for a party and  of course we were drunk and singing karaoke and he's like, oh, maybe Anthony could like  warble out some fucking Phil Collins for this bit, which is a couple of real douchebags  standing on line for Phil Collins show.  And, uh, I'm like, yeah, okay.  I could be a douchebag.  And, uh, we, we, uh, uh, filmed it here in Manhattan and, uh, yeah, Warner puts it out, 
[00:02:00]  right?  The Warner sound.  Boy, it's, uh, Joe and me online and, uh, DeRosa's hilarious in this.  Yeah.  He's, he's like the real over the top douchebag in this.  What are we waiting for?  A series.  Yeah.  Don't lie him on it.  What?  Oh.  Nah, dude.  Too psyched to be cold.  Phil Collins, dude.  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, I see Sam Roberts in there.  Where's Sam?  On the line.  I would call him.  Young Sam Roberts is there.  Oh, who's that Asian woman?  That's, wait a minute.  E-Rock.  When you get inside, I'll tell you that.  There's E-Rock.  All disgusted.  It's a gym he was looking at.  She's got a hold on to.  Believe it.  Oh, my bad.  My bad.  Yeah, what do you think he's going to open with?  Joe.  You think I'll play that Tarzan song?  That Tarzan song. 
[00:03:00]  That's what I hate about these city concerts, dude.  Everybody's so rude.  I'll tell you what I love about these city concerts.  Yeah.  I'm talking so much.  Am I out of Phil Collins?  We are really a couple of douchebags.  Yes, indeed.  Yes, indeed.  That's the best part.  Take a look at me now.  There's just an empty place.  I had to sing this 800 fucking times. 
[00:03:30]  You just gave me chills, dude.  Me too, but other kinds of things.  Yes, exactly.  Turn around and see me cry.  Dude!  You got the pipes, bro!  He really can do an over-the-top douchebag.  And I'm right in her face. 
[00:04:00]  I'm right in some chick's face.  She's pretty good.  I like her.  Yeah.  She's on the Twitter.  See what I mean, dude?  Rude!  Dude!  Rude!  What kind of way I wouldn't appreciate a man that can sing like that?  Cindy, you hate me.  Joe's great, man.  Yeah.  She did.  Yeah, that's why I got dumped.  In her defense, it's the only song I ever sang.  I sang it over and over and over.  She left. 
[00:04:30]  It's kind of ironic, though, you know.  I got dumped for singing a song about getting dumped.  Salt ejected.  You got dumped for singing.  It's cold, dude.  Dude.  And we got awful...  It's all good.  He's got a shirt on that says Phil, and I got a shirt on that says Collins.  We're wearing jean shorts.  Matching shirts?  Yeah.  Phil keeps us all...  Fucking fist bumps.  Fist bumping, and it's terrible. 
[00:05:00]  We're really awful.  Yeah.  I'm glad you got dumped.  You sound like a moron.  She was pretty funny when I saw Caroline's, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Danny.  Phil Collins, dude!  Yeah!  We are.  And someone pointed out that they spelt Ryder with two T's.  Oh, it's a Ritter.  Yeah.  John.  What was that?  Behind the couch, caller?  Yeah, it's good, man.  And you do belt that out well. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, thank you.  You do.  It was very hard to do 800 fucking times, and it was fucking, it was like icky cold that  day.  It wasn't warm.  It was just like it was cold and windy.  We had to do things 800 times because the fucking trucks kept coming by and the buses.  But it was like we'd start doing part of the scene.  And then as if it wasn't going to get worse, it started to get like three o'clock and four  and then just rush hour started. 
[00:06:00]  Rush hour started.  Just bus after bus after bus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was fun, though.  Joe's coming in soon, I guess.  What time is Joe scheduled?  It's seven.  Scheduled at seven?  Yeah.  Very good.  That's because you're doing something with Louie, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  I have to, I have to, it's a very quick shoot, but it's, I have to be there by 930, so I'm  leaving here at 830.  Oh, that's good.  To get my van.  There's a van over on 3rd Avenue.  I have to be home by 930, so I'm going to leave here now. 
[00:06:30]  What?  I'm kidding, of course.  What the fuck is this bullshit?  Whoa, no, Chip, I was just kidding.  I'll just go over to Opie's and blow out candles.  How come we're here?  How come I didn't get invited to the fucking party?  I'm in front of the party.  Is there a fucking party going on?  I'll fucking kick the cake and shit.  Happy birthday, motherfuckers.  You didn't think that would get laughs, Chip?  Dude, whenever I see a birthday cake, I think of smashing it.  Yes.  Not that I would do it, but I'm 43, and every time I see a cake, a festive moment of occasion, 
[00:07:00]  I want to fucking smash it.  And just ruin it.  Everybody would go, oh, that's not funny.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you play it out in your head, like how embarrassing it would be?  Yes.  If it happened.  I do that all the time.  I don't know.  I don't do the things, but I think of like the most horrible, embarrassing things you  could possibly do.  Like it won't happen if I just smashed the cake with my fist, hoping for a laugh, and  everybody was like, dude, you ruined it.  Everyone would just be mad.  Yeah.  Just be angry at you.  Bill Burr had a great bit in his act a few years ago about being at a street fair with 
[00:07:30]  his girlfriends, having some woman just having these home-baked muffins and how he wanted  to just punch the muffins and smash them while he looked at the lady in the eyes.  Smash her dumb muffins.  I sometimes get like more of a, I guess, violent fantasy.  Sometimes I just want to, if you see old ladies pushing their carts in the supermarket, I really  want to punch them in the face like really hard.  And I just look at how easily their fucking little frail jaw would break. 
[00:08:00]  Like, yeah, and then rape them, right?  What?  No, Chippa.  No, but don't you start to think like, what would that do to my career?  Like if you punch the lady in the face, you know how much trouble you'd get in?  You'd get in so much trouble.  But it's like, you don't do it, you think about it and then play it.  I don't know what that satisfies in a person to think about it and then play it out.  What would happen after you do that?  I'll tell you what it does.  It separates us from sociopaths who actually go, I want to push that woman in front of the 
[00:08:30]  train and then never play it out and just shove.  And you just do it.  Yeah, we play it out.  Like everyone has weird urges, but if you don't act on them, that's the difference to  us and fucking kooks.  I think it's also this thing that like you, you can do it.  There's nothing, there's not a wall stopping you from doing these terrible things.  There's only your own sanity keeping you from doing it.  So I think it's that, that accessibility to this nasty or horrible thing that makes 
[00:09:00]  you think about it and then play it out like, oh boy, you play out the consequences in your  head.  And even though you never do it in the first place, I think playing out the consequences,  I don't know what it does.  It's uncomfortable.  It is uncomfortable.  I don't know why we do that.  I always think about that.  Like I always think about pushing people in front of trains and stuff and think about  little things that I would do.  Like think about how dramatically my life would change if in this one second I did that.  Right, right, right.  Like everything would be different from that point on.  I've absolutely thought that too. 
[00:09:30]  It's like that, that fork in your life's road.  I could create a fork here.  Yeah.  I could make a fork right here and completely change my entire fucking life.  Uh, wow.  In like a second.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  It would never be the same after this.  That's crazy.  Yeah, that's what I always think.  It would never be the same.  I guess, I guess that's why we do it.  I don't know.  It's not really a reason though.  Like what is, what, what, like if somebody bends down to tie their shoe or something, I go like,  I think about how dramatically my life would change if I stomped on the back of their head  as hard as I could right now. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  It would be so different.  Yeah.  There's that, there's the violent things.  And then there's just the embarrassing things of like, um, uh, I remember when my, my sister  used to have these recitals, uh, even as a kid, I would think about that, like running  up on the stage and just going, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, and doing like some dumb dance.  And of course my sister would be crying and, and my, my parents would be pissed off and  there was nothing creative or clever or worth doing. 
[00:10:30]  It would just be me going dad, dad, dad, dad, all retarded and shit.  And yeah, like it would be, I play it on my head and I'd, I'd literally feel that embarrassment  feeling.  I don't know.  And then you, then you'd be like, well, I can't, I'm always afraid I'm going to do something  like that and then go, Oh my God, I did it.  I did.  I can't believe I did it.  Yes.  That's another thing that comes into play.  You think like, Oh God, what if I did it?  And then didn't realize I did it until after I did it.  Right.  Now I'm adequate.  That's the out of control psycho though.  That's the psycho.  You hope you never fall over that fucking cliff. 
[00:11:00]  Like coming to the realization, like, Oh my God, there's consequences now and they're  real.  This is actually happening now.  I can't undo it.  Right.  Yeah.  Those are the dreams that I have all the time too, is that I am in some bad situation where,  uh, something has happened.  I'm an accomplice to something.  And, uh, the, the cops are starting to fucking find out what I did.  And I'm like, Oh my God, I, I'm, I'm going to prison.  This sucks.  I don't want to go.  And then you wake up and it's like, Oh, I'm out of trouble.  Yeah.  Oh, that was easy.  I guess that's why people that are really in trouble go like, Oh my, we should please, 
[00:11:30]  please let this be a dream, please.  Can I just wake up and end this?  Like you ever think when a cop stand there, just run over and shaking his gun, not, not taking  it, but just shaking it.  Oh my God.  How much trouble you'd get in?  That's the one I've definitely thought of.  I, I, I know I've been in line behind a cop at like a, whatever, it's 7-11 or something.  And I'll look at his gun and I'll think, think about how dramatically my life would change  if I took the gun out of his holster and shot him right now.  Holy shit.  Oh, you, you really taking a step.  Everything would be different. 
[00:12:00]  Blasting.  Everything would be totally different.  But in that moment, it'd be like, Whoa, I did it.  This is crazy.  This is insane.  It's never like snapped in there.  Like it's always just out.  Like you could totally just go for it.  Cause I know what you're talking about.  And like, it's just, and you think like, I'm faster than this fucking guy.  Like he's not even paying attention.  That's the accessibility thing.  Like it's possible.  It's right there.  There is free will.  You can do this.  It's what it is.  Free will.  See, I never think about pulling it out.  Cause I, I always try to be something real.  I always think I'd never get that.  I was just thinking about shaking it and going like, ah, like what would he do? 
[00:12:30]  How fast would he fucking knock my teeth out?  You would fucking be on the floor in a second.  Or if you just asked him for it.  Got your gun.  What could he do if he asked for it?  But in your fantasy, you're just a weirdo who thinks that's like a good joke.  Like he's shaking the gun at the house.  A good natured ribbing.  Like pow pow.  Sam is just a fucking psycho.  Yeah.  Well, I don't do it.  Well, yeah, but I don't know.  What's, what's the line between there isn't not even thinking about it and doing it. 
[00:13:00]  Okay.  There's not even thinking about it and then actually doing it.  That's the spectrum.  Now in between is you think about it for a split second.  It's like, oh my God, that's terrible.  Or you playing out that you actually take it.  Now you're shooting him.  I'm just, I stare at the gun the entire time I'm online.  Like, huh, how would this play out?  And what are the different scenarios?  Because they change everything in a minute, in a second.  It beats looking at your phone.  Cause at least you're using your brain and your imagination.  Oh, I see that.  I'm imagining how to ruin my life. 
[00:13:30]  That's healthy.  But it really does.  Now that there's the internet and you can watch everything online, it changes your imagination.  Like your imagination used to be fun.  Now it's like just reenacting fucking things you've seen on.  Horrible things from the fucking.  Websites, yeah.  Internet.  Wow.  I never thought of that.  You know what I think about sometimes?  I was at a, I was waiting for a plane and I had a, I was waiting at the gate and there  was like a bar nearby.  So I had a beer and they had, gave me a glass.  And I was thinking about how easy it would be because I had my, my carry on luggage to  just finish the, finish the drink. 
[00:14:00]  Have, now I have glass.  I could just throw that in my bag.  No one's ever going to know.  Now I have a glass in my bag.  Now I take that on the plane.  I give it a kick or two, break, break the glass.  Now I have shards of glass on a plane that I can now stab people with and do whatever  I want.  And then, and then I would think about how, well, after that day, no airport ever in the  United States would ever serve glassware.  Oh, so you could change everything.  So I could change the world for the better.  Either that or you just step on the glass and realize you were married to a Jew on the 
[00:14:30]  plane.  Well, both scenarios would be troublesome.  You could change, uh, change the way people have to live.  Yeah.  And I mean, and then, you know, I would think, and then my, my, my full name, my three names  would be in the paper the next day on the front page.  So I'd be like, Hey, I could be famous for a week and really change things.  And then they could have like the Danny Ross restriction.  Yeah, exactly.  It'll, it'll be like my law, Danny's law.  Danny's law, no glasses in the terminal ever.  Even though it wouldn't be as impactful.  I think the whole thing would be funnier if it was just you jumping on your sister's 
[00:15:00]  recital stage and going, I used to think of that, man.  It was just embarrassing.  I'd cringe.  You were like, all the people would be looking at me like, what is he doing?  Is he retarded?  But did you look at the aisle like to see, well, if I, I just ran up the aisle, I could  jump on stage.  I'd see the stairs going up to the stage and be like, I could just run up there.  What was the dance you wanted to do?  It was, it was actually, and I remember my sister's wearing some, uh, thing.  It was like the Holland.  It was like somewhere from Holland. 
[00:15:30]  So she had wooden shoes on and, and that little Holland bonnet and stuff.  And she was like dancing going, I have got a pair of wooden shoes, pretty wooden shoes,  little wooden shoes.  This is how I dance away when blues with my pair of wooden shoes.  How do you remember every lyric?  Because I thought about running up there and going, I thought about it a lot.  And taking everything your sister worked so hard for and practiced for and just making 
[00:16:00]  a mockery in front of everyone.  It would ruin my sister.  She would be like fucking devastated because it's her little fucking solo recital.  And my, my mom would be like, oh, my dad would call me a faggot.  I guess I'm doing this.  Jesus Christ, son of a bitch.  Look at him up there.  Jesus Christ.  Look at him up there.  Yeah.  Ro, what'd you do to him? 
[00:16:30]  Oh, shut up, Joey.  That's what would happen.  Oh God.  Yeah.  And the dance is funny because people can't see, but the arms are out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because the arms are out.  In crucifixion pose almost.  So you got to like, yeah, dude, dude, I just look like a buffoon up there.  It's like the way that you'd put your arms out if you were trying to describe a fat person.  Yes.  I just, oh, that would be horrible.  Anthony, boy, does the wooden shoe dance.  The wooden shoe.  Spoils the recital.  I wrecked the dance by doing the wooden shoe dance.  You know how great it would be if you had done it and you could tell that story now. 
[00:17:00]  Oh my God.  You know how great that would have been.  Well, I never knew I was going to be on radio back then, so I just, you know, I thought  I'd look silly and not be like, oh boy, in a thousand years I'm going to have a great  fucking radio story.  That's how I ruined my sister's side hold.  The wooden shoes or something.  The wooden shoe dance.  That sounds like an awful song in fairness.  Oh, it was terrible.  And I had to listen to it over and over while she practiced at home.  This is how I dance away my blues with my pair of wooden shoes. 
[00:17:30]  Fucking good.  No.  Oh, you're going to rock it up?  Yeah.  Fucking tight dance with my blues.  The sick full puppies.  Yeah.  I don't think that would wash.  I'll kick your ass at wooden shoes.  Yeah.  Well, I hope we all keep our sanity and never delve into, you know, grabbing the cop's gun  and shooting him or.  Or just saying bad things.  Yeah.  Like saying inappropriate.  Like saying shitty cunt at a bad time.  Like when your mother's friends are talking or. 
[00:18:00]  Oh man.  And yes.  You know what I've sometimes thought about?  I've thought, even from when I was younger, I've thought about how yelling horrible things  to my mother right to her face and how much it would hurt her feelings.  I've totally thought about it.  Just look at her and be like, shut the fuck up, idiot.  And just how hurt she would be by it.  Dude, I thought one day, there was one Christmas, I'm over at my grandma's house where all of,  I mean, every relative is there.  Yeah.  And they're pretty fucking, you know, Italian.  And, and my grandmother was walking around doing something and I thought what everyone would 
[00:18:30]  do if I just stood up and went, shut up, you fucking cunt.  Wouldn't it be funny if you did it and they all just stood and applauded?  Finally, somebody said it.  It had to be said.  But I thought that and then I was trying to like get it out of my head because I felt  so bad.  And do you picture like what her face would look like?  Like how hurt, like what?  Nobody's ever talked to me like that.  Why would he do that?  I've been so nice. 
[00:19:00]  And I, I was, then I tried to like forget it, but the more I tried to forget it, the  more I was thinking about it and it wouldn't go away.  And then I, I started to equate my grandmother's face with cunt.  And I'm like, this is, this is terrible.  I have to stop doing this.  You go down on a girl, you start thinking about your grandma.  Oh God, that would suck.  Yeah, that was pretty horrific.  Just, man.  Just hurting feelings.  Because that would also change everything.  Like your grandmother would always like, always look at me as the guy that called her cunt 
[00:19:30]  For no reason whatsoever.  On Christmas.  Yeah.  It would change everything.  It would be unchanged.  It would be unfictual.  Yeah.  God, what is that?  Why is that?  I don't understand why we do that.  It's probably, it's like the same thing that helps you be funny.  Like that same weird mental reaching that you, it's like a weird mental exercise.  Like where you just kind of fucking, uh, you're just throwing jabs mentally in your  head.  Yeah.  It's like a weird workout.  And it's like when you're being funny, you're thinking about weird shit to say and weird  places to put inappropriate statements.  It's kind of the same thing. 
[00:20:00]  Church does that too.  And you're at a funeral or something and you're just thinking about standing up in the middle  of the silence and just saying an awful thing about the person.  I always wanted to ruin a wedding.  Like when they go like, you know, if there's anybody, uh, you know, who feels like this  couple should not be mad.  I always wanted to be like, me, and then just say something really terrible.  She's a cunt and I fucked her a bunch of times.  Oh man.  I, I thought about it.  Honestly, like I would love to do that.  Me and you both would love to do that.  At my own wedding.  When the father's walking her down the aisle, just getting up and smacking her in the face. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Like that.  Totally.  It sounds like, yeah, totally.  Just get up and fucking smack her in the face.  Oh, the hush.  Oh, it's just like weird feeling that, you know, in your brain, like I'm capable just  with my brain and my body of ruining everything.  I got legs.  Yes.  I get up.  You're always prepared.  There's no tools required to do this.  Yes.  In a moment's notice.  Oh, I could do this if I had a wrench. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, if only I had.  No.  You know what I mean?  You can do it right now.  Like at any given moment, I could ruin everything.  Even for myself.  I could ruin my life anytime I want.  Ruin your life.  Or an email you could send out or a racist tweet or a racist text.  You could just send somebody something so horrible.  Oh, well.  Then watch, but watching that bar go once you've hit send and how unchangeable that is.  Like you'd send something to your boss or something.  Like to your boss, which is the most heinous shit about like his wife or something.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  That'd be terrible.  Yeah.  And you have that power. 
[00:21:30]  It's just.  It's probably the control thing because it's so difficult to make your life awesome.  But it's like so easy to make your life horrible.  So you're like, well, at least I did it.  I did something.  I made my life horrible.  You could ruin someone else's life, too.  Right.  Like a wedding like that.  Just ruining someone's wedding.  Do you think that would be a part of the wedding memory?  If like on the way up the aisle, one of the guests slapped the bride in the face?  Oh, my God.  Just or not even in the face.  Just stomach.  Punch her in the stomach. 
[00:22:00]  She doubles over and shits herself.  Give her a nice ass pat as she's going down the aisle.  Or just rip her fucking top open so her tits are hanging out in front of her dad.  Or don't even touch her.  As they're walking up the aisle, just get in the aisle in front of them and go.  Do your little research.  Here comes the pig.  Here comes the pig.  You fucking pig.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  That would be bad.  She's just looking at you. 
[00:22:30]  And the father's like, oh, what are you doing?  Shut up, old man.  You probably fucked her.  Oh, just get like really rude.  What's better than 200 people gasping at the same time?  That sound is amazing.  She's just looking at you like, why would you do that?  They would stop walking.  Earl, they would stop walking.  Like, is this part of the wedding?  How fast before like the ushers and fucking the whole bridal party like grabs you though  and fucking just throws you out of the place and beats you off?  That's the best part about this is Bill Burr bit because he brings that up and he does  say, you know, you'd have some time because of the shock value that is put in place. 
[00:23:00]  Like, how many muffins could I actually punch and squeeze before somebody was like, hey,  wait a second.  What are you doing?  What is he doing?  Yeah, because there's that moment where people are just trying to process it.  Yeah, and you'd be like, what the fuck is this guy doing?  Yeah.  No one ever jumps right to action.  You have to process it.  You have to punch our muffins.  We have to play the bit now.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me go.  We can save it for after the discussion.  Yeah, but it's so funny.  You'd also ruin the bride's life because the bride would be after that going, what did 
[00:23:30]  I do to deserve this?  Right, right.  And her whole wedding memory is just that.  And it was just an act of randomness.  She did nothing to deserve it.  Nothing.  It was just a random act.  Just because you could do it, you did it and fucked her whole fucking memory up of the  greatest day in her life.  It's kind of like Project Mayhem on a more subtle level.  Yeah, yeah.  More personal.  Yeah.  But it's definitely along the same lines.  It's like, you know what?  Let's just fucking blow up a credit building.  Let's do that.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's destroy some corporate artwork because we can and it sucks.  Or things you could say on a plane even. 
[00:24:00]  Like, I've thought of that too.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Like, I could literally have this flight landed and ruin my career.  Because your career...  NBC would never let me on Lenovo again.  I could never do this or that.  You'd be the crazy airplane guy.  You would be the crazy racist on the plane or the crazy whatever on the plane.  You would wreck things in an unfixable way.  Wow, yeah.  Never go back to normal.  Kind of like Fight Club again to bring it up.  But you ever kind of pray that something goes down on the plane?  Not really.  Not pray that it goes down.  But like, if it was going down, you wouldn't be scared.  It would be kind of exciting almost.  Yeah, because it's part of your fantasy. 
[00:24:30]  Like, just stop whatever's happening.  Well, no, no, no.  Not like that.  But like if the plane...  Like a crash?  Yeah, kind of.  Oh, man.  Like, not a lot of people get to experience that.  So like, if that was going down, would you be just frozen in fear?  Or would you take the time to just kind of be like, well, I'm going to...  Just be able to...  Accept it and experience it?  Wow, that's fucking psycho.  You'd be frozen in fear for all.  Your instincts would override your desire to go, wow, let me process this one moment.  I wonder if anyone ever did do that fantasy thing they think of, though. 
[00:25:00]  And like, I'm just going to grab the first bitch I see and fuck her.  Like, a plane goes down, they find a body, just, you know, a guy fucking a chick.  There's a penis in a vagina.  His severed arm is fingering her.  Or, uh...  I always think, like, if my flight ever switches, like if Kenny ever changes my flights, a part  of me secretly hopes that the flight I was supposed to be on crashes, just so I can have an amazing  story.  He'll sacrifice the plane full of people, so it's like... 
[00:25:30]  Just so you can tweet about it.  Yeah, just like, I was supposed to be on that flight.  People can go, really?  Oh my God.  Thank God.  I must be meant to be here.  Yeah, yeah.  God intended for me to stay.  This does make sense.  Somebody here is saying, this discussion is called Three Guys That Aren't Married and  Have No Kids.  I guess you think differently.  But do you think differently like that?  I don't know, because I think the same thing.  I mean, maybe, but when I see little kids, I think, like, imagine how hard I could kick 
[00:26:00]  that kid, and imagine the damage it would do to me and my life.  Yeah.  That's another thing, too.  You could just, like, grab a kid and smash him onto the ground.  Right.  And the parent wouldn't have time to stop you.  You're fucked.  Yeah, yeah.  You're pretty fucked up.  Pick the kid up and throw him on the floor.  Yeah, the uncles grab you.  Make you leave the party.  Do they, Uncle Paul?  Sure.  What happens there?  Oh, they call the police.  You're all black and blue.  The only thing I could think of that would change by having a kid was now I could just 
[00:26:30]  direct these fantasies towards the kid and be like, I could fucking punch this kid in  the field.  You know, like your kid's screaming and crying, and you just don't want to deal with it.  Right.  You could probably just fantasize about pouring boiling hot water.  Oh, shit.  To the kid's stomach or whatever.  I think that's the only thing that would change.  Like, you'd still have those thoughts.  As we're talking, I looked at this headline.  Washington man accused of hitting noisy kid at theater charge.  Oh.  See?  And the guy was with his girlfriend or whatever watching Titanic 3D, and he punched a 10-year-old 
[00:27:00]  in the face for being noisy.  Yeah, hard enough to loosen up a tooth.  Loosen the tooth.  It's like it's gone.  He punched him in the face.  Like, we've all thought of that.  Yeah.  But he said he just got so mad and just did it.  Like, wow.  What a pussy, though.  A 10-year-old?  Come on.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Wait till some fucking adults are on their phones.  Yeah, and then try punching them in the face.  That ain't gonna happen.  It's really hard for me to restrain myself in the theater these days.  The older I get, I just don't care.  I just don't fucking go because of that.  And it's because of all the shitty experiences I've had in movie theaters. 
[00:27:30]  It's too stressful to sit down in a seat, find a good seat, and then sit down, and then  someone's gotta go and get some candy, and I gotta save the seat.  That's stressful.  And then you gotta hope somebody doesn't sit in front of you that's too big, or behind  you that's yapping, and you gotta hope maybe if somebody does start talking that you can  say something to them and they're not fucking animals that are gonna kill you.  I can't fucking deal with that for a movie.  You ever play roulette where you just walk in and you take a look around and you just go, 
[00:28:00]  okay, he's gonna be a problem.  Oh, yeah.  That group of girls is gonna be yappy nonstop.  You assess the situation.  And then you end up being right half the time, too.  Yes.  I can't take it, though.  Literally, it's too much pressure.  I'm not even kidding.  It's too much stress.  I go in, I sit down, and all I'm doing is thinking how this experience is gonna get  fucked up by somebody.  And now there's like, you have a glowing screen in front of you the whole time, because  the person who's sitting in front of you is just on Facebook on their phone for  the entire movie.  Yeah, they think because it's not ringing or they're not talking, that they're not 
[00:28:30]  interrupting things.  But yeah, the light that shines off of the fucking phone at a movie theater sucks.  I would like to take this time to praise the Alamo Draft House for their theater policies.  Their theater experience.  If you're on your phone, you're fucking out.  If you take your phone out and start texting, you're fucking out.  No questions.  Oh, really?  One chance to fucking behave, and if you don't, you're out.  They don't bother with that shit.  Fuck off.  Jack White wasn't letting people take even cell phone pictures.  He said just why, like, one of his roadies comes out before the show and says just, he  says, we're gonna post pictures of the concert on the website that you can all download. 
[00:29:00]  So just enjoy it with your eyes.  And what's his take on that?  Is it a thing where he doesn't want pictures of him out there?  Or is it a thing like, I'm doing a show, I want people to kind of enjoy it?  I think that's what it is.  He doesn't like that people are watching him through their phones, he wants people to  just be there and enjoy the show.  It is odd that people have just gotten to the point where they won't enjoy the experience  of being there anymore with their eyes and brain and ears and everything.  They have to feel, they feel that they have to capture the moment to show it to other 
[00:29:30]  people to prove they were there or some shit.  Because we never could, though.  I think that's what it is, too.  It's like, I went and saw Kiss in like 78 or something with my father.  Did you get a Polaroid camera with you?  Yeah.  A land camera?  But it's like, you always have to go by your childhood memories, you have almost, I have  no photos of stuff like that.  Yeah.  So it's like, now that I can, I do.  But it is a weird obsession with capturing the moment.  I think you're giving up something, though, by doing that.  You're getting a moment on your camera, but you're kind of missing out on watching it and 
[00:30:00]  just enjoying it.  Yeah.  Yeah, it devalues any memory.  Like, the actual memory itself, it's worthless without a photo.  Yeah.  And if you do see something good, you're pissed because you missed it with your camera.  Yeah.  You're like, oh, fuck.  I should have gotten a picture of that.  It's like, really?  Why?  Why?  Carlin had a funny bit about that.  He goes, the obsession with documenting everything.  He's like, if people's lives are empty, that they have to just watch themselves or relive  shit that they've already done, like, watch themselves, live stuff they've already done 
[00:30:30]  about videotaping everything, I think you were talking about.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  People went through a phase where, when camcorders first were kind of affordable enough where  people got them, that they videotaped every inane part of their fucking lives.  And then that whole thing died out.  Like, the big, giant camcorders, and then they got smaller and stuff.  I remember going to, like, Disney or something.  And you'd see people trying to get on rides with shit that, like, the network news uses  on their shoulder.  Yeah.  And then shit got smaller.  It got easier to cart around. 
[00:31:00]  But no one ever wanted to watch those.  I don't know anybody that actually taped shit from vacation that people watched.  It's only cool when you look back at the fact that you have it.  Like I said, that Carson documentary.  There's footage of Johnny Carson when he was a teenager.  It's Carson.  People are interested in him.  But, I mean, like, back in the fucking 40s, that was.  And his family had, like, a video camera.  And I'm like, I wish my family had that shit.  I wish my family.  Now everyone has it, so it means nothing.  But, like, the fact that you have footage when you were a kid is amazing to me.  I know that I'm pretty fucking happy about. 
[00:31:30]  It's amazing that you have that.  That we got that.  My father was big with the 8mm camera.  And that's one good thing about my childhood, I guess.  Documented me crying, being a little faggot behind the drums.  Yeah, and then I guess now everybody's got phones with video and pictures.  And you can just put it up on Facebook.  Like, someone's complaining here, and it's true.  Like, who gives a fuck what you ate?  Like, people will, they will tweet. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, Big A.  And Facebook shit they eat.  Yeah.  Big A's one for that.  Also, uh, oh, fucking, what's her name?  Lily.  Yeah.  Lily fucking is constantly tweeting.  Remember from Ron Fez?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, she's constantly tweeting her food.  Does she?  Yes!  Why?  It's not interesting.  No!  Food.  I used to follow Big A, but I still would be able to check him out.  But I stopped, because it was all fucking food stuff.  It's not an interesting thing. 
[00:32:30]  Nobody cares about your egg whites.  There's literally, literally, everybody who's on Twitter eats food.  I don't care.  Everyone.  It's not a unique thing.  I don't believe you.  Literally, 100% of the people are eating something.  It's almost always people, and it's not to knock Lily or Andrew, but it's usually people  who aren't in a quote-unquote creative field, so they don't get to express themselves all  the time.  It's almost like they take a picture of something and go, look what I did!  Look!  Here!  Lunch!  Yeah, it's lunch. 
[00:33:00]  They don't have a filter as to what will interest people or not.  Sometimes we don't even on the show have it.  Right, right.  I've been doing this stand-up for 20-something years, and I'll talk about things that nobody  in the room gives a fuck.  I'm like, I should know better.  So if I was just taking pictures randomly, I know I would send out way too many things  that nobody cared about.  It's what happens with Instagram, too, I noticed.  People are like, yeah, you should Instagram more.  It's like, well, if I take a nice picture of something or something interesting, I might 
[00:33:30]  Instagram it.  But a lot of people just Instagram nothingness.  Oh my God, do they?  Just nothingness.  You know what I can't stand?  Instagram was made so that you could have these artsy, fartsy type of things.  Right.  So taking a screen cap of a text message that you got from your boyfriend and Instagramming  it is not the point of Instagram.  It's turning into a photo dump.  Yeah, and it's obnoxious.  It really is.  That's why I don't follow a lot of people on Instagram, because I don't want to see that  show up in my feed ever.  Can you, let me ask you a question about Instagram, by the way, off subject.  Sure.  Can you take a picture that you've already taken and load it into Instagram? 
[00:34:00]  Oh, yes, you can.  I don't know how to do that.  I have a photo that I want to Instagram.  It just has to be on your phone, and there's a little icon.  Yeah.  A little thingy.  And you can't, but I can't fucking connect Instagram to Twitter.  What's happening?  You just slide.  There's a part of the things, yeah, it says Twitter, connect to Twitter.  But it won't connect to my Twitter.  I can't connect to Twitter.  I can't connect to Twitter.  Makes me crazy.  Yeah, it works.  All right, slide one on, Sam.  There's a little thing after you're about to post a picture, and there's a list of things  you want to share this with, Twitter, Facebook, da-da-da. 
[00:34:30]  You just have to say, yeah.  I might just start stealing, like, famous pictures, like really good pictures, and just  Instagram them.  Why not?  Like my own.  Put a filter on fucking, you know.  Filter that Vietnamese guy getting his head blown out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or that dumb naked Vietnamese girl running down the fucking...  Kim Phuc.  Dude, do you know how funny that is?  Do you know the artist who was doing that?  There was a guy taking photos of famous photos.  He was photographing famous or other photos, and just selling the photos of the photos 
[00:35:00]  as his.  Oh, man.  And it was this weird thing, like, is it art?  Yeah, yeah.  And he's like, yeah, it's art.  Technically, it is.  It's stealing, but it's also...  But it's his photo of your photo.  Wow.  So what is the line?  And he wasn't lying about it.  No.  What is the line that's appropriate for art?  He wasn't trying to pass it off as his own, so...  Yeah.  The Instagram thing, though, people have, again, just gotten carried away to the point  where it just isn't good.  Yeah, like, I could post six pictures a day, but I'm aware that people don't want to see 
[00:35:30]  my cat six times.  Well, you see there, you're wrong.  Cats are adorable.  I have a big fat cat.  It's not a little kitten.  See, I can't hit my fucking button for my regular picture of my thing.  Email, message, sign to contact you.  No, no, no, no, no.  Go into the app first.  Oh, see what you did?  Thanks, Kenny.  See what you did there?  God!  I don't know.  I don't know.  Watch the share settings.  I hit the Twitter button.  Watch what happens.  I know people...  We couldn't connect to Twitter.  If you see this arrow repeatedly, tap learn more to visit our help. 
[00:36:00]  Help centers always suck your dick.  Help never works.  No, help centers stink.  You probably need to put your...  Have you put your Twitter name and password in Instagram before?  Oh, you gotta do that.  Yeah, why don't you fucking buzz off?  It's gotta know where to go.  How else would it get in?  I don't know how to do that.  What do I do it?  No one tells me anything.  Well, what's your password?  I don't want to tell you that because you'll be posting as Jim Norton.  Comment on 37.  You just gotta go, dude, you know, you're Instagram like me.  I take a picture of a building.  I throw 6,000 filters on it.  But now Bob Kelly's selling his Instagram photos. 
[00:36:30]  Do you know that?  No, he's not.  He's created...  There's some kind of like...  Is that the gallery?  Yeah, there's a gallery that you can sign up for.  They accept you or whatever.  And Bob is selling prints of his Instagram photos.  Holy shit.  That's fucking insanity.  Yeah.  What a horse's ass.  Who wants that?  Yeah, he really is a horse's patoot that Bob Kelly...  It's like fucking, you just take a picture, you make it a little blue, you make it red,  boom, you make it shiny. 
[00:37:00]  Do people actually buy them?  I wouldn't think so.  I have some of these on my fridge.  You do?  Someone got me some Instagram fridge magnets.  Of your stuff?  Not like as a serious...  It was, you know, just pictures.  When you're in a relationship, you get pictures together.  Yeah, yeah.  Just little things like that.  Yeah, I really don't put a lot of stuff on Instagram.  Unless, you know...  I forget about it for like three weeks at a clip.  Yeah, and then I'll post a picture, and then I forget about it for three weeks. 
[00:37:30]  Sometimes I'll be in the middle of like cropping it and doing stuff, and I'll just be like,  this sucks, and I'm not going to do it anymore.  I'm not going to fucking put this up.  Can we all take a picture of something simple and think it's going to be great?  Yeah.  Like, you know, I took the Washington Monument and put a filter on it, and I'm like, you  douche.  I suck.  That is pretty cheesy.  Oh, what a cheesedick.  It's not artsy.  You looking up at the building?  That's how everyone sees a building, stupid.  And you write hashtag Washington Monument and click on it, and there's 17,000 identical pictures  to yours. 
[00:38:00]  Same fucking pictures.  If you can get one standing above it and looking down, take that.  If not, fucking stop it.  A lot of people do that, that whole corner of the building.  They'll go to the corner of the building, tip the camera way up, and take the picture  of the building from the corner of it and the ground, and it's like, oh, look at that.  It's artsy.  There's eight million fucking pictures like that.  I've taken one good photo like that, like when I was on the Golden Gate Bridge with Kenny.  Yeah.  I had a joke.  Was it about throwing you to the wall for being gay?  Of course, I could have either. 
[00:38:30]  At the same time.  And I took one up, like whatever, there's the holes.  The towers, yeah.  Yeah.  That's the only good picture I've ever taken like that.  Yeah.  Sometimes you've got to realize, like, eh, I'm not that fucking creative.  Yes.  I'm really not that, I think it looks good, but Bobby's got to realize that.  We slam him when he comes here.  People got to know they're good at certain things, and that doesn't mean they're allowed  to be good at everything.  Yeah.  Just concentrate on what you're good at.  He would just like to be good at something.  There's, look at that.  There you go. 
[00:39:00]  There's one of the pictures.  Wow, look.  It's a building.  Just like I see it on the street.  That's the Roland specialty.  Roland's awful with his fucking New York skyline, fucking.  It's weird because, like, Roland and Troy both take pictures of New York City constantly,  and it's like, before Instagram, you would be called a tourist for doing this.  Yeah.  Yeah, now it's just like, oh, man, it's my art.  Yeah.  It's my art.  Stop taking pictures of the city.  Yeah, any New Yorker that walked around taking pictures of the city was like a douche.  Right.  Like, what are you doing?  Or a mark. 
[00:39:30]  I see people taking a mark.  I see people taking photos in the subway, and I'm just like, I wonder how much money  is in their wallet.  Yeah, you fucking mark.  That's like the first thing in my head, like, just going to bring it full circle.  I do fantasize about robbing idiot tourists in the city all the fucking time.  Yes.  Because it would be the easiest thing.  Yeah.  They're walking around with a subway map, pointing at things.  It's like, holy fuck.  Cameras around in there.  If this was 1987, you would already have something sharp inside of you.  Yeah.  Asians are really, like, the cameras, a lot of cameras around the necks. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  I was walking through Times Square the other day, and I noticed, like, at every corner,  there was a group of Asians with full-size cameras, not little phone cameras, just snapping  pictures of everything in Times Square.  It's like that stereotype just seems to really kind of stick.  Yeah.  But all I was thinking also was, wow, what a mark.  You know, I hope they stick to the Times Square area and don't delve off the beaten  path too far.  They don't call it.  I don't fuck with them.  Well, that's true, too.  I mean, look, I'm thinking about it, so imagine the people that would actually take action. 
[00:40:30]  Do it.  Robbers are thinking about it, too.  And then some.  So just keep that in mind.  Yeah.  Have you ever seen a crime on the subway?  Have you ever actually seen one go down?  One time, I was in the subway, though, and there was these three black guys in the back.  Uh-oh.  And one guy was just counting huge amounts of cash, like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds  of dollars in cash.  And I was just, like, looking and then not looking.  But I was, like, fascinated by it. 
[00:41:00]  But I was like, but he can't.  You should have asked him, like, wow, where did you get that?  Can I have some?  Yeah.  But then he saw me looking and just started staring at me.  And I was like, oh, man.  Oh, man.  What have I done?  What are you, crazy?  And next stop, I ran off.  Yeah, but the thing was, he's counting hundreds in front of you.  Why would you count that much?  He's probably just not even thinking about it.  To him, it's just business as usual.  I assumed at that point he was an armed drug dealer.  Could be a good assumption right there.  I think.  Did he stare at you a long time?  Yes.  Like, he just stared at me, like, keep looking. 
[00:41:30]  And I stopped immediately looking.  I looked down at the floor as if I had never, ever looked in that direction.  He was going to get some more money.  And ran off at the next stop.  Yeah.  I was just, I would think, like, with all of us, and, you know, guys take the subway  a lot and shit for over the course of a few years, you'd think you would have seen something  if it's that dangerous.  Yeah.  You know?  I don't know.  I don't know anybody that's actually, except for that guy that fucking, you know, stabbed 
[00:42:00]  in the head.  Yeah, the subway hero.  I mean, when I was a kid, I remember seeing, not, like, anything really intense, but, like,  attempted robberies, I would say.  Oh, really?  Yeah, like, you know, some thuggy, some group of kids comes on, and maybe, like, your group  is the only group in the train car, and the other group goes, oh, easy kids to pick on  or whatever, but, you know, then they'll try to rustle you up or whatever, but, you  know, something like that, but that's probably about it, though.  And I've never been alone on a fucking subway.  Really?  You haven't?  No.  I've gotten blown on a subway.  Really?  You have? 
[00:42:30]  What was his name?  It was a long time ago, actually, but, yeah, I got blown for a few stops on the seven  train until someone came in.  I see somebody has to ruin it for you.  Yeah, bastards.  I was, uh, I've been on the subway alone a lot, just going home from work here or whatever.  Have you ever felt like, uh-oh, something's going to go down?  No, there was one time I was on the subway, and I was sitting there, and I think about this  moment a lot, because it was one of these defining moments.  There's a black guy sitting across from me.  It always starts that way.  It always.  That's why every great story starts.  And I'm sitting on my- 
[00:43:00]  Especially with John Travolta.  I know.  Wow, who knew we would have to blow CeeLo?  See that photo of the guy?  Yeah.  I'm sitting on the subway kind of leaning on my knees, and I had sunglasses on, and there  was a black guy sitting across from me.  I think he felt like I was eyeballing him, because when you have sunglasses, it's really  hard to tell sometimes if somebody's staring at you.  Yeah.  Like, and I was like looking up and looking around, but just kind of sitting there with  my glasses on.  But he had sunglasses on, and then he looked across at me, and he took his sunglasses and  put them down over the bridge of his nose and just looked at me over his glasses. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, shit.  Like, I know he kind of thought I was probably doing something that I really wasn't doing,  but it was one of those defining moments.  And I've always thought, like, you pussy, you should have.  Yeah, you should have done exactly what you did.  Nothing.  I didn't, but I really wasn't, and I'm like, why would I think that, like, why do I think  I should have done something when he was wrong, misread something, and he could have just  been some guy on his way home from doing four years in fucking jail, and I'm going to eyeball  him on my way home from a serious XM.  Like, what a dummy I am.  Yeah, yeah.  We have these stupid things as guys where you think you should have, and that could have 
[00:44:00]  been one of those moments where I did eyeball him for no reason, just because I think  I'm supposed to now that he has, and all of a sudden I get slashed or get my fucking  teeth knocked out.  I'm really glad I didn't.  So you didn't do the staring contest?  You looked away?  Looked away, because literally, I knew that he...  He must have loved that you looked away.  I don't even know...  You sound like pussy, motherfucker.  I don't even know if it was that kind of thing.  Like, I don't even know if he gave a shit that I looked away.  Why would he fucking...  I don't even know...  Pardon me, are you Jim Norton? 
[00:44:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  But I mean, I don't even know if for him it was like, yeah, I punked him, or if it was  just...  It seems so matter of fact that he thought I was staring, so he pulled his things down, like  what?  I bet that's a sport for intimidating-looking black gentlemen.  Maybe.  To just see how many white people they can make just look away and look fearful.  Yeah, they probably can't fight at all.  They're just like, I'll bet.  Yeah, yeah, just watch this.  Watch this, man.  I'm just going to look at him.  There, look.  He looked away.  It is a weird thing to, like, when you eyeball somebody, they eyeball you.  Like, what is the protocol? 
[00:45:00]  Because, like, you don't want to look away, but then all of a sudden you're staring at  each other.  And it's like, in all animals, like, chimps hate it.  Human beings hate it.  I'm sure, like, dogs don't like...  There's something about eye contact which fucking says aggression.  Yeah, yeah.  There is some kind of a threat there.  It's some kind of a primal fucking threatening thing.  And the person that looks away, I think, is the submissive one in the pairing.  I would have smiled at him and nodded as if he meant to say hello and then looked right  at the floor.  That would have been it. 
[00:45:30]  Sometimes if you do that, like, if you nod at somebody, they nod back at you.  I don't know.  The situation you're describing, I don't think you'd have gotten a nod.  Probably not.  Why would he look at you over his glasses?  Because the way it was with my sunglasses, I think he thought I was staring at him.  And...  So what?  But he was just like...  But it's the same thing.  It's almost like...  Yeah, but it's...  If he thought I was staring at him, he was like, okay, like, what?  Like, what are you staring at me for?  I don't remember.  It was such a weird moment that I hadn't... 
[00:46:00]  It's a very aggressive thing going on there.  Yeah, it was, but I don't know if it was an aggression or if it was a reaction to what  he thought I was doing that was aggressive.  You never know on the train.  You fucking never...  You just...  And you just should not do anything.  Right.  When you leave, you kind of feel like a pussy for not doing anything, but at least you're  leaving.  You know?  Because like you said, you don't know.  Because you get those lunatics with fucking knives that just jump up and start stabbing  someone in the throat.  Yeah.  Like, oh, great.  I should have fucking not looked at him.  What an asshole.  It's like you hear...  There's a case, of course, where the newspaper in Virginia didn't report it recently, where 
[00:46:30]  there was a white guy and this woman.  They were attacked by a mob of black guys.  Oh, yeah.  And the paper got a lot of flack for not reporting.  It was one of their own reporters.  And they said, well, it was a simple assault.  It was a racial attack.  But the reason I'm mentioning it is because the guy...  I forget what happened.  There was some kind of an altercation.  The guy and the girl got in the car.  They were in the car.  And then somebody threw a brick at the car.  And this dummy gets out.  Why would you do that?  And confronts the guy and then gets the shit beat out of him.  And then the woman gets out. 
[00:47:00]  Of course, they beat her up, too.  But look, what are you doing?  And that's one of those moments where the guy bricked his car.  And he had the ego of going, well, I can't just in front of her leave with my car bricked.  It's like, you should have just drove away, stupid.  Yes, you can.  That's one of those moments where, dude, you got to just go.  Getting out of the car isn't going to take the dent out of your fucking car.  No.  Put a new one in your fucking head.  What do you think he's going to do in trade insurance papers with you?  Yeah, excuse me.  You just threw a brick through your window.  Yeah, yeah.  Could you show me your insurance cards, please? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, that ain't going to happen.  I don't know.  There was that other, you hear about that other racial incident where the woman was online at a drive-thru?  McDonald's?  Oh, yeah.  Holy shit.  That, I don't, I did read that where they threw the one guy.  I don't know if that was a racial, or if it was just a fight where something racist was yelled.  Because I think the woman, it was a black guy and a black woman and a white woman was in her car.  Yeah.  Something had happened between them, and then the fucking, oh, the black woman littered or the black guy littered. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  So then the fucking white girl spoke up.  She goes, that's not cool.  And then the black girl got out of the car and started biting her hands.  She left teeth marks in the woman's hands and punching her face.  I know, it's fucking ludicrous.  And then the guy joined in, and then he said...  Did he hit her or just throw a soda at her?  He said, fucking white bitch.  White bitch, right.  And then threw a grape soda at her.  He had the quote of the century.  Yeah, yeah, that is a great quote.  Yeah, it was really funny, and it made me laugh. 
[00:48:30]  And I actually, when I was sending this to you guys as prep last night, I changed.  Because the headline is McDonald's vandalized, blah, blah, blah.  To me, that was not the story.  The story was what he had said.  Yeah.  Now I'm going to have to find it in the goddamn thing.  By the way, Drudge Report is great.  They're the only ones who are reporting these incidents as what they are.  Black on white racial...  Oh, is the quote not even in here?  Racial problems.  But that one, I don't know if it was or not, or if that was just a fight where somebody...  Because I don't think the guy hit her.  I think the guy just threw a soda at her. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, but you know what?  But why bring up the race?  Yeah, let's just put it the other way around.  The second you mention race, it becomes some kind of a hate crime.  Yeah, that's to me.  It does.  They do it that way, but I don't know if that makes it a hate crime just because they handle it that way.  Well, it actually does because I think in the case of...  What's his name?  Fat fucking...  Bobby?  No.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God.  Fat Nick?  Yes. 
[00:49:30]  I think in that case, it would have just been an assault, but he threw out his racial epithets,  and that's what made it a racial hate crime.  Right.  Here's the quote.  He said, this is for you, you white bitch.  This is grape soda.  Yeah, and he threw it at her.  Grape soda.  But I'm saying, because they handled it like that, does that...  Like, I'm saying in a perfect world, if you're arguing with somebody, you say the most horrible shit.  Like, if that was a fat...  Say it was a fat lady who said it.  Yeah.  And they were all...  And you fat bitch, take this.  You yell the worst thing. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, but...  Okay, then...  But you yell the worst thing, but then if you yell the worst thing at a black person, it's a hate crime.  Sure.  There's that extra added fucking shit on that.  Who is that hot fucking chick in the mugshot?  I agree with you.  I just...  I don't know if that makes it a hate crime just because they call it one.  Oh, are these just fucking...  Yeah, it's just like, you know, hot chick fucking mugshots.  Wow, yeah.  I thought that was the chick that got assaulted.  They certainly know how to keep you on the page.  That is funny.  White bitch, here's some grapes.  A grape soda is like, oh, really? 
[00:50:30]  You're going to throw Cheetos at her, too?  This is for you, you white bitch.  This is a grape soda.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Quote.  Thank you, sir.  That is just savage behavior.  It really is.  Biting someone's hand because they fucking called you out on throwing litter.  There's just this air of fucking violence that's going on this day and age that no one really  wants to acknowledge.  I mean, really.  God.  There's so many stories, but the mainstream media covers it up. 
[00:51:00]  Like you said, at least Drudge is fucking acknowledging them.  I've seen quite a few over the past couple of years.  This sounds like something that was, I mean, when you're biting someone's fingers, I mean, there's  some kind of premeditation there.  I mean, it's not like everybody was just laughing and having a good time when they were ordering,  and then somewhere between then and her littering, there was this, I'm going to bite your fingers  off anger that exploded.  Yeah, yeah.  I kind of think it was just like you were saying about the tension and something in the air. 
[00:51:30]  I think some people are, they cannot wait for something to go down.  Something to happen.  So while it's not premeditated, all of this behavior was ready to go.  The spring is wound.  They just needed that one thing, because I'm sure these people driving around couldn't  wait for a white person to get up in their face about something.  Yeah, yeah.  That's why it's good when you look down on the subway, because again, you never want  to be talking to the guy who really is waiting for something to go down eagerly.  Right, waiting for something to happen.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I don't know how good of a... 
[00:52:00]  Dr. Steve.  What's that?  Dr. Steve.  Oh, I...  He texts me during the show.  Yeah, me too.  I don't mind it at all.  No, I don't either.  He's a good egg.  He is a good egg.  Something to have his license revoked, I'm sure.  No.  Dr. Steve's a good egg.  Yeah, he's a good doctor, too.  I've been having the apnea nonsense.  How's that going?  It's okay, but the doctor's office, who I've been dealing with, is so bad.  Like, they're fucking terrible, man.  They made me wait four days for something that they forgot to call in, and then I ordered 
[00:52:30]  these apnea masks, and that's a prescription.  So I gave them my doctor's number, I said, call, and they'll fax you my prescription, and  you can mail me the apnea mask.  Four days later, the doctor has never responded.  I'm sure he's a...  He's, I'm sure, a qualified doctor, but it's the worst experience I've ever had with medical...  The fucking medical profession.  Like, Dr. Steve is a guy who's great.  Yeah.  He really does care about you, but most of them are just shit.  Yeah.  They're fucking shit.  Just get their fucking, get their cash from the insurance companies. 
[00:53:00]  They'll just refer you somewhere else, so they can just get some cash.  I haven't had a regular doctor, I think, forever.  And especially, like, during my adult life, I cannot find a doctor, because everyone I  go to, they just treat you like cattle.  Yep.  And, like, you just go in.  Like, they don't give a fuck about you.  They don't ask you any questions.  Just get in, get out, and, you know, file your insurance.  It's not the old days.  Where they come over your house with the little black bag.  I mean, like, I don't know what questions to ask.  Like, I don't fucking know.  Like, so if you're not helping me, I'm not, I don't, I'm not knowing the questions to ask 
[00:53:30]  you when I go to the doctor.  So, so be a doctor and fucking ask me questions.  Aren't you getting paid a lot of money?  Not, not like I'm paying you out of my pocket, but I pay my insurance every month.  I'd like a little more than a fucking touch my balls and talk to me for, like, 35 seconds.  It would be nice.  I mean, I don't see how you assess somebody's health.  You know, when the last time you've been to the doctor was 12 months ago, and they just  take a look at your ball sack and go, oh, you quit smoking.  That's good.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[00:54:00]  I guess you got to go in for that full physical.  I never, yeah.  And I never have.  I need that, I guess.  Then they probably, you know, ask you a few more questions.  Or you got to get a better doctor.  Yeah.  And then even the blood work, too, because I hadn't had blood work done in a while.  So I set out for blood work.  And then you call them.  They just go, yeah, you're all good.  Oh, okay, thanks.  But what, what about it?  Like, like, is there anything I should be avoiding?  Is there something that's borderline?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, how about you give me some fucking information?  That's true.  Yeah, yeah.  What is my cholesterol?  No one gives a fuck.  They just want to get, move on to the next phone call because there's a ton of them to 
[00:54:30]  make.  Yeah.  I love when I get a call like that.  Oh, you're all good.  That's all I need to know.  That's it.  Hang up quick.  That's all I need to know.  You're all good, except for click.  Wait a minute.  What was he saying?  You never want bad news.  No.  No, man.  No, that'd be awful.  Should we break it?  Yeah.  Yeah, we got our food here.  Do you want to play that Bill Burr bit?  I do.  Do you want to hear that Bill Burr bit?  I've heard of the bit.  I don't think I've ever heard of it.  Yeah.  It's really funny.  I enjoy it very much.  Bill Burr is a funny challenge.  So let's give that a shot then.  Yes.  Bill Burr.  And we'll be online. 
[00:55:00]  Doroso will be here soon.  Yes.  He will.  We're going to eat now.  And we'll be back in a flash.  All the time.  I do.  My girl took me to a street fair recently, right?  You know, they close off the block.  There's like shawarma.  There's like stuff made out of buttons, right?  People with no teeth are making keychains, right?  It's a typical girlfriend idea.  It sucks and it's going to take all Saturday, right?  No, we show up, right?  The first thing she sees is this big table and nothing but homemade jewelry, right? 
[00:55:30]  Homemade jewelry.  It's got twigs, macaroni in it.  It's a table of crap.  It's crap.  The whole thing is crap.  But she loves it.  She's like, oh my God, look at these earrings.  Do you like these?  Do you think these are nice?  I just want to be like, no.  If they were nice, they'd be in a store.  All right?  But I don't want to ruin a day.  So I'm like, yeah, go ahead.  Check it out.  I'm going to go get some air.  Even though we're outside, I think there's more air to be had, right? 
[00:56:00]  So I walk like three, four tables away and I come up to this lady.  She's got this big table of nothing but muffins.  Muffins, right?  It's like 85 degrees out.  She's selling muffins and she's got this big stupid,  oh, look at the muffins I made.  Look at her face.  And the second I saw that, that part of my brain was just like, dude,  what would happen if you just walked up and just said, hey, lady, are these your muffins?  Oh, yeah?  And then I just started going, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack. 
[00:56:30]  Like, how many of these muffins could I mush before anybody did anything?  I mean, realistically, I think I could have got the whole table.  Because even if you saw me doing that, it would take at least five to six seconds to process.  Like, did they say he could do that?  Is it like a game to eat the muffin off your fist?  That just seems like a waste of pastry.  You know, there's no security at a street fair.  There's no bouncer staying there. 
[00:57:00]  He's mushing the muffins.  Okay, I'm on it.  Sir, we're going to have to ask you to leave.  You're going to choke me out.  So I just started thinking of the horrified look on this lady's face  as I started slamming these muffins.  And out of nowhere, I just started laughing like a maniac.  I'm like slumped over this fried dough cart.  I'm dying.  My girl looks at me.  She's like, what the hell are you laughing at?  And like an idiot, I actually tried to explain.  I just screwed up thought to her. 
[00:57:30]  I swear to God, I'm just sitting there like,  I was just thinking, what if I started punching the muffins?  You know what I mean?  I just started punching them.  She's just looking at me like, why do I go out with you?  Dude, but I swear to God, if I never broke eye contact  the second I started hitting those muffins,  that lady, she wouldn't even be able to call for help.  I would have been in her head.  She'd be like, did I go to high school with this guy?  Why would you do that? 
[00:58:00]  Muffins are a healthy food.  I don't understand this.  Serious, Serious Accents.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  So take a look at me now.  Well, it's just an empty state.  Oh, it's our song.  Opie and Anthony program.  Joe DeRosa.  Hi.  Joining the show.  Hi, Joe.  Eight.  Oh, my God.  This song used to hold a special place in my heart. 
[00:58:30]  You know, being a child of the 80s, I do remember maybe this on when I had some sexual intercourse.  Yeah.  Back in the day.  And now it just reminds me of standing out on a cold street, singing this 800 times into some pretty girl's face.  First of all, before the explanation of what that means, my memories of this song were when I was six, going to see my grandfather as he was sick in the hospital. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, God.  And laying in the backseat of the car because it was nighttime, and this and Hello by Lionel Richie would always come on.  So I really am not a fan of either song.  It's another one of my favorites.  I sing a karaoke.  But you sang this like a champion.  We did a video together.  Oh, that was great.  And you sang this like a champion.  Thank you, sir.  It's getting raves, your video.  Why don't you tell the people about it, Joe? 
[00:59:30]  Well, folks, I did a video.  I was going to try to sneak the plug in, but fuck it.  Nah, blatant.  Let's put it out there on a platter.  I signed a web series deal with Warner Music for their new channel, The Warner Sound on YouTube.  YouTube's doing all these new YouTube channels.  Yeah.  So The Warner Sound is one of them, and I'm doing a web series for them called What Are We Waiting For? 
[01:00:00]  about a music fanboy and his friends going to different music events and the shit that they do to annoy people unknowingly.  Yes.  Just by being douches.  Yeah.  Just by being way too excited.  Yeah.  Way too excited.  And the stuff that happens to them and stuff as they try to get into a show or whatever.  So the first episode was about me and a friend, my character and a friend, standing in line for Phil Collins, and you played my friend. 
[01:00:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  And I had the Collins shirt on, right?  Yes.  And you had the Phil shirt on.  And the Phil shirt on.  Yes.  Yeah.  And the cut-off jean shorts.  Yes.  Sneakers and dark socks pulled up all the way up my shins.  Yeah.  The socks pulled up.  It was beautiful.  And my hair was slicked back.  I looked like a real fucking asshole.  So, yeah, we played the two guys standing in line waiting for Phil Collins, and at one point you sing the song. 
[01:01:00]  Yes.  You sing Against All Odds, and you sing it like a fucking angel.  Oh, and your character just can't get enough.  Loves it.  Your jaw hit the ground.  I can't get enough of you singing in real life.  That's why I wrote that into the thing.  I was like, I want Anthony singing in this thing.  I loved when you called me up and approached me with that.  And it's like, you know, we were down, we were singing the karaoke thing, and I noticed you were singing this song.  It's like, oh, yeah, I'll do it. 
[01:01:30]  My favorite part of the whole thing, though, is after you get the beer.  Yeah, that's right.  Thank you.  That was my favorite, like, aspect of getting to do this was I always, I'm from Philly, and I always wanted to play.  Philly's just got the most grotesque, disgusting accent I've ever heard in my life.  And I always wanted to do that in something, and I never got a chance to.  Yeah.  Because when I go on auditions for, you know, TV shows and stuff, if I went in doing that, they'd be like, what the fuck are you?  Don't take any liberties, asshole.  Just read the fucking lines. 
[01:02:00]  So I was like, oh, this is my thing, so I can do it finally.  So it was fun to be like, you know.  Yeah, yeah, dude.  Fucking drinking, bro.  It's such an awful, awful accent.  It's obnoxious.  Why the in-line concept for, it's a good idea.  Thanks.  Why wait in line for concerts?  Well, originally, the idea was going to be the same title, and it was going to be me going to concert lines.  Because when I talked to them originally, I talked to them, I said, there's always these lines in the city for things. 
[01:02:30]  You never know what anybody's waiting for, and you want to know.  And I went up to somebody one day in a line, and I said, what are you waiting for?  And they said, Hanson.  And I said, how long have you been out here?  And she goes, three hours.  And I go, you know they suck, right?  Like, how are you standing out here?  And she got really mad.  So I told them that story, and they wanted to do a thing where it was me going up to people in line.  Why are you here?  What are you waiting for?  Da-da-da-da.  And then they said, well, actually, we're more interested in doing, like, a scripted thing.  Do you have any ideas?  And I was like, well, what if we just took that line idea and made it about two guys waiting in line about the people that are super excited to get in? 
[01:03:00]  And then that was it.  Like, that was, that was, it had to be a music-related thing, because it was for Warner Music or whatever.  And that was it.  So all the other scripts have some variation of waiting or trying to get into the show or whatever.  Everything isn't literally standing in line or whatever.  So that's why.  And where could people see this? 
[01:03:30]  YouTube.com slash the Warner Sound.  And, you know, Anthony, you just fuck, you kill it, dude.  You're so funny in it, dude.  Oh, my goodness, Joe.  Thank you.  I want to thank everybody that was involved.  You know, they just made me better.  Sam, Sam's face pops up in it.  Danny's in there.  Yes.  E-Rock's in there.  I didn't see Danny.  I saw E-Rock, and I didn't see Sammy there.  Danny Cakes had his hood up the whole time, so he couldn't really tell it was him.  It was supposed to be cold.  I was getting into the role. 
[01:04:00]  It was, yeah.  It was supposed to be cold on the line, and that's why we were in shorts and T-shirts,  because we were the douchebags on the line.  So, and I'm talking, you know, I hope I'm not speaking out of turn here in any way,  but, like, you know, I want to talk to Opie about trying to get him into one.  I talked to Jimmy about wanting to get him into one.  Yeah.  I want to just get, like.  I signed on.  My friends.  Yeah.  You're signed on.  Yes.  I sent Jimmy a script, and he said, okay.  Yeah, that's good.  So, you know, I just want to get a bunch of funny people in this, in these, you know, 
[01:04:30]  like a rotating cast of funny people that I admire.  I do accents, too, though, but I do them always from overseas.  Oh, really?  I just bring that.  Yeah.  Dude, what, dude?  Would you lie to go to this show?  Just wreck Joe's sketch.  Like, Jim, it's not working.  No, jump tight.  It's funny.  It's good.  Jim, it's not.  The fucking, the comments on YouTube, I'm actually going over to Warner.  Oh, my God.  And you can come do this if you want tomorrow.  At 12 o'clock tomorrow, I'm going over to Warner Brothers to sit in a room while they, 
[01:05:00]  in their studio, while they videotape me reading the comments under the YouTube video.  Oh, shit.  Because everything is just like, it's a funny video, you shoulderless asshole.  You know, like every.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's just insult after insult.  One said, who's Joe's dad standing next to him?  It's all shoulder insults.  Oh, yeah.  You know, it was fucking, some of them were so funny.  And then all the Facebook comments were really nice, but one guy wrote, what a lump of shit. 
[01:05:30]  This thing was fucking terrible.  Really?  Oh, thanks.  I wrote to him.  I was like, why would you write that?  Oh, my God.  Why would you write back?  I go, that's so mean.  Why would you?  Joe, why did you write back?  He's because he's a guy that I've interacted with on Facebook before, and I've always believed,  like he's written me stuff, and I've always been nice.  So I wrote to him.  I go, why would you write a hateful thing like that?  I'm like, I don't understand.  Why would you do that?  And he sent me this fucking huge letter of like, I'm not going to suck your ass cheeks 
[01:06:00]  like everybody else does.  If I see a lump of shit, I call it.  You put it out there, buddy.  Whoa.  So take the criticism.  It was like so harsh.  And I hope you just unfriended him or blocked him.  You know, I got to.  Fuck them.  You shouldn't know.  So a criticism, if he would have written and said, I don't think this was Joe's best  thing, where I've seen things I like better, there's a way to do that without being a cunt.  If the guy's being a cunt to you, you absolutely should be a cunt back. 
[01:06:30]  You know what happened?  And I told Keith Robinson this story last night, and he trashed me up and down the fucking cellar.  Thank you for leaving, by the way, because as soon as you left, that trashing went right  on to me.  I was getting a beating.  Why are you getting a beating?  Oh, big one.  Yeah.  I was getting a beating.  Oh, it's getting trashed.  You left, and it was just like, oh, Jimmy's gone.  Oh, they all went right to you.  Oh, that's fucking hilarious.  I told him this story.  I'm going to make you think about this, honestly.  I told him this story, and he goes, what'd you do? 
[01:07:00]  And I go, honestly, dude, this has never happened to me, and I've been a little emotional  lately because of the stuff happening with my mom and stuff, whatever.  So I went to his page.  I was already at a tee off on him, and I fucking had the message, and I was like, I'm going  to take this.  I'm fucking 0-8 tomorrow.  I'm going to fucking trash him.  And I was so mad.  And I started looking at his pictures, and it was just him alone in every picture.  And I started to feel sad.  And I was like, this guy's just like...  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  Fuck.  He's alone.  Fuck that cocksucker.  Deserves being alone. 
[01:07:30]  That's why...  It's not sad.  Yes.  That's why he's alone, because he's a fucking jerk off.  It's not sad that he's alone.  If he would have said, hey, man, that was kind of...  I shouldn't have said that.  His criticism is fair.  If he didn't like something, okay.  Sure.  But he was a scumbag.  Being nice to you in one minute, and then just being a jerk off.  There's a way to criticize something and not be a cocksucker.  Or how about he goes, oh, that's a lump of shit, as opposed to my stuff, which I will  post links to here, and now watch what a good video looks like, and then he's got a bunch 
[01:08:00]  of great stuff.  Some of these scumbags you can't be nice to.  There was one guy, right, who was sending me these weird tweets or whatever, so I blocked  him.  And it turns out he was on medication.  I think we had nasty email exchanges.  And I'm nasty to these fucking cocksuckers.  AZT.  And I hope.  But then we were nice to each other or whatever.  He's like, dude, I'm sorry.  I was on this medication.  I unblocked him on Twitter.  And then this scumbag, this fucking scumbag starts sending me nasty emails again. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, my God.  It's like his little baby is probably on his medication again.  And it's like, you fuck, why would I have been nice to that jerk off?  I knew he was a jerk off, but I showed niceness because I had a guy say, sorry, he was on  medication.  I never should have fucking looked at him as anything but a jerk off.  That's why I have one fucking sentence.  And it's permanent fucking block, unfollow, ban, things like that.  That's it.  I don't have a, you know, oh, you're sentenced to, you know, two weeks without being able 
[01:09:00]  to read the genius that is me.  Once you're done, you're done.  I'll unblock it.  And if you go to a friend and have them fucking get in touch with me and say, why'd you block  him?  He would like you to unblock.  Then that guy gets blocked, too.  That is the wonderful thing about Twitter, Twitter particularly, that you could have  like fucking Frank Sinatra-like resolve and like just cutting people.  You're fucking dead to me.  Who did you?  You looked at my girl.  Lock.  Change the locks. 
[01:09:30]  He's never allowed to do it again.  Dead to me.  Like, I love that aspect of it.  And yeah, like I said, that's why I wanted to get your temperature, both of your temperatures  on this.  Because I was like, I've been a little fucking emotional.  I've been a little soft lately.  That guy's a cocksucker, dude.  He's a cocksucker who thinks, sorry to interrupt you, but who thinks that he's just telling it  like it is.  Yeah.  But he's being a jerk off.  He's not just telling you, I'm not going to suck your ass.  That's a little fucking lonely zero of a man who thinks that he's just telling it like 
[01:10:00]  it is.  When he's being a cunt, you should block him.  I forget they're alive.  I literally, I'll go back over the, I do what Anthony taught me.  Send him a hateful message, block.  And that's Twitter.  And I forget they ever lived.  Yes.  It's great.  Gone.  That is fucking great.  But some of these fucking douchebags said it so you can't direct message them.  And I have followed guys so I could direct message them to be like, go fuck yourself.  And then you can't direct message them.  So then they see me following them and then unfollowing them three times because I'm like, 
[01:10:30]  what the fuck is going on?  Where's the guy that direct messaged you?  Never follow them.  Just block them then.  If you can't send them a direct message, block them.  You'll never think of them again.  I forget they lived.  I love it.  I love knowing that they're going to have to listen to this show or whatever it is I'm  doing.  And I wouldn't, if they commit suicide, I'll never hear about it.  You'll never know.  You'll never know if they write anything about you.  It doesn't matter.  It really is the classic heckler response of, hey, I don't come down to where you work 
[01:11:00]  and knock the dick out of your mouth or whatever.  But that really is true.  There's a reason why that's the most famous heckler response ever.  And it's what you guys were, I think, Anthony, you said, if you, it'd be different if you  said, well, here's my stuff and whatever.  But I'm really getting tired of like, you know, some guy talking to me like he's Roger  Ebert, except he says, cunt.  You know what I mean?  And then I go to his page and it's like, what do you do besides fish?  You know what I mean?  Go fuck yourself. 
[01:11:30]  Like, I wouldn't, I wouldn't go, hey, here's how you fucking tie a line off.  You fucking asshole.  You dumb cunt fisherman.  You don't know what the fuck you're doing.  It's like, I don't know anything about that, so I wouldn't talk about it.  But there's this persona, this entitled shit where if you speak freely on radio or podcast  or on stage even, it's, hey, buddy, tough shit, man.  You know what I mean?  You put yourself out there.  Yeah, it's really annoying.  There's a part of that, though, where we do open ourselves for criticism because we  also, it's almost like I'll take certain criticism because I don't get mad if they send me 
[01:12:00]  adulation.  Like, I've never had a guy send me an email where he's going, hey, I like your stuff, or I've  written back and go, who cares about your opinion?  It's only when they're, the reason the anonymity annoys me is because they would say nice things  to your face.  Most of them wouldn't say the negative things to your face.  That's why that annoys me.  But it's when they criticize like scumbags.  I've gotten criticism that I thought was fair.  Yeah, yeah.  That I was like, ah, you know what?  He didn't like something I did.  I never liked that, but I get it.  But it's when they're jerk offs like that guy.  Can we go to, Danny, can we go to George Page? 
[01:12:30]  We can see this cunt.  A lot of times, too, I don't even, I won't comment to somebody and then block them.  I'll just block them.  Yeah.  Like sometimes they're not even worth a comment.  It's like, well, you guys got, and I love the accounts where somebody's trying to bash  me.  They have no followers.  Hey, Bobby.  They have no followers.  They have one tweet, which is the one directed toward me.  Yeah.  It's like they made the account because I had blocked them already and they wanted to get  me back.  Danny, let me sign into my thing and I'll read the response letter.  Oh. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  The guy, but the guy is a jerk, especially if you wrote to him and said, why would you  write that?  The guy's just being a jerk off.  But he's probably like this asshole that I dealt with who's on medication and then we have  nice exchanges and then he's a cocksucker.  Yeah.  I'm so fucking tired of people blaming their medication.  Yeah, I agree.  And everything.  And then, you know, the other thing that, the thing that pisses me off more than anything  is when somebody will engage you in a rational criticism, like Jimmy was talking about, like 
[01:13:30]  where somebody will say fairly, like, hey man, your stance on hippies or whatever the  fuck it is, is unfair and here's why.  And then they rattle off this counter argument and then you go, okay, I don't agree with that.  And then you rattle something back and then they retort and get a little feisty and then  it gets a little heated and then they go, hey man, you're starting to get a little angry.  Let's just drop it.  It's like, fuck you fec, you fucking started it.  Now you're going to tell me to fucking drop this right now? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  You're the one that came at me.  Well, no, you started it with your bit.  No, I didn't.  I just did a fucking bit.  I didn't call you personally and yell it into your goddamn voicemail and say, listen  to me right now.  Hey, you got me all wound up.  Yeah, look at Joe.  Joe is fucking feeling it.  That's how you deal with these jerk offs.  Hey there, Bobby.  Nobody in this room can fight, too.  We all talk tough.  Hey, man.  Let me tell you something.  You'll fuck up.  I'll fucking what?  I'll kick your ass.  Okay, well, listen, settle down. 
[01:14:30]  Where's Bobby going to sit?  But it's not about beating somebody up.  It's literally just about responding meanly.  Nah, you can sit over there.  That's okay.  What an idiot.  Oh, that's your picture.  So here's the post.  So everybody's saying really nice shit and everything.  This guy comes on.  He's like third from the bottom, too.  Holy shit, really?  What a turd of mammoth proportion.  Shrugs.  Send it to SNL.  Maybe they'll use it.  Oh. 
[01:15:00]  Let's see Tracy.  Sounds like a compliment.  Let's see guy with a girl's name.  Let's see what he is.  The guy with a girl's name.  Let's see his pictures.  Hold on.  Let's go to his profile.  Okay.  Yeah, of course.  I see what you're saying.  Okay.  So this is.  Oh, God.  That guy.  He's one of those guys.  And his top friends.  There's Bobby Kelly.  Fucking traitor.  Ah, fucking Bobby.  Of course he likes Bobby.  Of course he likes Bobby.  One of his top friends.  And big A.  That's my Uncle Tracy.  And let's see the response.  Shut up.  Oh, Jesus.  Let's see the response.  Shut up.  Oh, he's got a big fantasy background.  Let's see his pictures. 
[01:15:30]  What has he got?  A World of Warcraft?  Or fucking.  Wow.  What is that?  I don't know.  But I went.  Oh, man.  Oh, what a tool.  Oh.  Oh, his pictures are terrible.  Oh, it's a donkey in a big hole.  And it says asshole.  There's that.  It's a little foghorn leghorn.  Which I'm a fan of.  Oh, he's looking cool right there.  Stop and look at that shirt.  He probably went like, that's a cool picture.  I'm going to post that.  Look at that shirt.  That's him alone.  Like Joe said.  With a fucking shirt. 
[01:16:00]  What is that?  Shadow palm trees.  That's a dangerous palm tree shirt.  Yeah.  That is a James Gandolfini shirt.  If I've ever fucking seen one.  Yes.  Is he on your friends list?  Yeah, we're friends.  Why wouldn't you just dismiss, unfriend him, and then block him on Twitter again?  And then that's the end of your knowledge of his life.  Because I got my emotions got in the way.  So I saw we were friends, and then I saw that I had messages with him, right?  So here's the thing.  This is from when Patrice was sick.  Hey, Joe.  Anything on Patrice at all? 
[01:16:30]  Not seeing any updates anywhere.  Hey, no shoulders.  Any chance the new, you know what, dude, podcast will have a video element like you streaming  in the future?  Love it!  Exclamation point.  Even though my music intro was better.  This is the guy that wrote the intro music to the podcast.  This is a good intro.  Not as good as yours.  It fucking stunk.  Not as good as yours.  I'd like to hear it.  This fucking asshole trashed me.  Yours is the best.  Would you back me, please?  You're right.  This fucking guy.  Joe responded nicely.  You're right.  Joe responded nicely.  I'm not sure, pal.  Hopefully this is a guaranteed...  That's a question for Bobby, dude.  Like, that's way back in December. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, very nice.  And then he writes that thing, what a turd of a whatever, under the video.  So then I go to him, and I go, why leave a hateful comment on my page?  I don't get it.  Like, we talked to this guy through the podcast.  We were cool with him.  Right.  This is what he writes back.  Wasn't hateful.  Instead of kissing your butt and saying I loved it, I was honest.  I found it to be pretty bad and not something I cared for at all.  Seems too put on.  Two is spelled wrong.  The camera doing close-ups of the girl's reaction made it look completely put on like a skit.  It was a skit, you fucking asshole. 
[01:17:30]  But it was.  Do you think it was really me and Anthony standing in a concert line?  You fucking idiot.  It's supposed to be that.  It's supposed to be exactly what it was.  What tipped it off as a skit?  The opening credits.  Yeah.  Like, the music.  Holy shit.  And us talking and dressing like we don't talk or dress.  It wasn't a whole movie.  That was funny.  What an asshole.  Like, dressing like we don't talk or dress.  Yeah.  What tipped it off as a skit?  The cutaways to Sam and E-Rock acting like they didn't know who we were? 
[01:18:00]  Fucking idiot.  Skit.  Anyway.  What a tipped.  Skit like.  And for a skit, I guess it was okay if you like SNL type stuff.  I don't.  I don't.  I like your comedy stand-up much more than the skit material.  And Anthony's a funny fuck and can't believe he wasn't the first to point out the dry cornball thing that shaped up to be...  That shaped up to be what?  What?  Sorry, man.  Wasn't trying to be a total douche, but felt like I had to stand up with a real opinion rather than slobber on your ass cheeks. 
[01:18:30]  I guess I could have followed the rule.  If you don't have something nice to say, then don't blah, blah, blah.  All the blahs are spelled wrong.  But you put that video out there, so to be fair, you should be okay with the feedback you get.  Well, what I was thinking when I wrote this, when I wrote this, Joe, I wanted to help you.  Okay?  And that's why I put Tracy instead of me, because I thought it hit too hard.  See, I don't think this...  I don't think him criticizing it was unfair.  It was the way he did it. 
[01:19:00]  It was a jerk-off.  Just unfriend the guy and don't...  I mean, you know, don't hate him.  Why would you allow him on your friends?  He can write what he wants, but why would you have him as a friend on Facebook?  That's not...  That's too far.  That's what I'm saying.  That's acting like a real critic.  Like, you're a fan of Joe, you're a friend of his, just say, dude, I wasn't a fan that much.  You don't have to go into the...  I mean, a whole article of why you didn't like a five-minute skit on YouTube.  You know what happened?  The way you...  Here's what fucking happened. 
[01:19:30]  Are you Tracy?  You can't...  Dude, here's what happened.  The way you spoke with him before, he's your friend now.  So you're pals, and he's talking to you like, you know how everyone slams each other in here?  He's one of the guys now.  Oh, I'm fucking friends with Joe DeRosa.  No, you're not.  You're a Facebook fucking leech.  Yeah.  Hey, Joe, you and me are friends.  Remember the time I asked you about your friend that was sick that I never met that you actually...  It's like, dude, you know the names and work of people that I know. 
[01:20:00]  It doesn't mean they're mutual friends between the two of us.  That's it.  It doesn't...  And because I talk personally on this show doesn't mean you fucking know me, and it just  drives me fucking crazy.  I've bitched about this to Bobby so many fucking times.  No, it's the worst.  I can't stand it.  You're getting used to it.  I'm sorry, Bobby.  You're getting used to it, but the more it happens, the more adjusted to it you get,  and the more you realize, just insult them once, block them, and you literally, if they're  killed in drunk driving accidents, you'll never know. 
[01:20:30]  I don't even insult them anymore.  I used to do the same thing.  I used to follow them, DM them, insult them, but now I just block them.  Here's the thing, too.  You'll get a message from somebody else.  This is why I love Patrice, because he would block somebody for trying to get somebody back  in.  That's what I did.  I was just saying that.  I do the same thing.  It's like, get the fuck out of here.  No.  And now you're shilling for this guy?  Boom.  You're gone, too.  But they don't understand.  It's like they say fucking terrible shit.  You can only wake up...  I was telling Norton this.  You can only wake up and be called fat and hope you die. 
[01:21:00]  So many times, before you actually pull the trigger and take yourself out.  I mean, I'm not...  I'm funny, but I'm human.  I wake up and feel like shit.  Humans.  This is the problem with Norton.  You know what Norton is?  This is what Norton is.  Right after he's shying out.  This is what Norton is.  Norton is the reason he actually helped me.  He took me to the grocery store.  We talked.  He got me on the Weight Watchers app.  He's literally there saying, dude, don't eat that.  Don't do that.  Really, he's like Mr. Miyagi. 
[01:21:30]  But imagine if Mr. Miyagi helped him, the Karate Kid.  Daniel.  Yeah, Daniel.  And then when he took him to the thing to set up the fight, he actually just started kicking  the shit out of Daniel with fucking...  With the blonde-haired bad guy.  Yeah, the blonde-haired guy.  Exactly.  That's what he is.  Miyagi walks over to Elizabeth Shue at the end.  Your faggot boyfriend put his little ankle out there.  Yeah, he's an evil Mr. Miyagi.  Elizabeth Boots instead of shoes. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, God.  What?  Let me ask you this.  Because we're all big fanboys in our own right of music and movies and all that shit.  I hate music.  I hate movies.  All right.  I hate music and movies.  I hate movies under five minutes.  I hate movies under five minutes.  Mammoth lumps of shit.  I don't blame you.  Yes, mammoth lumps of shit.  I mean, it's good if you like that SNL skit shit.  But here's the thing. 
[01:22:30]  This is the one thing I hate about...  I like that Twitter and Facebook provide open discussion.  I think that's pretty cool.  But what bothers me is I'm a fan of so many musicians and whatever,  and a lot of the musicians I love have put out bad albums.  Never in a million fucking years would I write to a band that I admired or respected and go,  you know what, dude?  Let me tell you.  This last album, here's where you went wrong.  It's like, who the fuck am I to do that, man?  Or if you did it.  Or if you did it.  There's been Aussie songs I didn't like,  but I wouldn't address it like, hey, you're shitty. 
[01:23:00]  I'll be like, yeah, I like that.  I don't like that song as much as the other ones.  And it's not kissing your ass not doing that.  Yeah.  Like you're saying, oh, I'm not going to kiss your ass.  Well, you don't have to do that.  It's not considered kissing your ass if you don't like something.  Yeah, you're not going to go up to your mom and go, you fat.  You're fat mom.  You're not what you used to be.  Unless you want to feel embarrassed.  But make her feel bad.  But the question still remains, like, even if you said, like, with the Aussie example, 
[01:23:30]  hey, man, there's songs I don't like.  But you would say that if it was prompted.  If somebody asked you, would you go out of your way to write to him and go, let me tell  you, let me give you my pointers.  That's the point I don't get.  It's like, who does that?  Because you've got to stand, though, this show creates a vibe of we're all hanging out.  Even the people listening are like, dude, we're all friends.  We're all hanging out.  These guys fucked with each other because they're such good friends.  We allow them in on that because we bring them in on the show.  We talk to them on Twitter.  We fucking do all that shit.  So when they write in, it's like them being part of the gang, even though it's like, look, 
[01:24:00]  there's a fine line that we always walk between really hurting each other's feelings and getting  into a fight and actually having a laugh.  You know what I mean?  I mean, Norton doesn't walk with me at all.  He just steps on my heart.  But my fat heart, apparently, I just step in the holes behind you.  I like that we both did a good fat joke on me.  But yeah, but that's the thing is when they write back, dude, I was just kidding. 
[01:24:30]  I have so many emails.  I was just trying to be part of the show, what you guys do.  No.  Yeah, you know, dude, I don't know you.  I've known Norton for fucking 20 years.  Yeah.  I've known Joe for six months.  You don't jump up on the stage with a band that you like, that you're going to see and  stop playing.  I got a message popped up, and I missed it.  I'm sorry.  Was it another mean one?  No, I thought it was, but it was actually nice.  Oh, that would have been fucking funny.  I'm sorry.  What did you say?  Nah, it was too late.  And by the way, did I catch a fucking beating last night? 
[01:25:00]  Oh, God.  I got pictures.  Why were you getting beat on?  I was standing there.  I was standing there after my set, and this kind of cute, really cute girl actually came  up to me.  Total Norton chick.  Total.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, listen to me.  If Norton has a type, this is the type.  Really?  She was a little smaller than I like, but she came up, and she was like, hi.  Yeah, but her cock was big.  That's the perfect Norton chick.  But she's like, I really loved your set downstairs.  I'm a big fan.  I love your stuff.  I'm like, oh, thanks. 
[01:25:30]  And I immediately said to her, like, we were just talking.  I'm like, oh, thanks a lot.  And I always try to find out who they're with.  You always do.  It's the first thing.  So I'm like, are you from the city?  She goes, yeah.  I'm like, were you here with a big group?  Like, I'll never say, who are you with?  Oh, that's funny.  You're here with a big group?  Were you here with a big group of people?  Mind you, to set up a little bit, though, me, Keith, Tom Papa, DeRosa, we're a foot away  at a table.  And I'm standing.  Watching this broad, she comes up with her little starlit eyes looking up at Norton.  Norton, he saw her come up, and he became that Norton, like, you know, TV Norton. 
[01:26:00]  Like, hey, how are you, right?  Yeah.  He lit up.  It was like a moment.  And you guys are just like wolves waiting.  No, no, no.  We all, when we see Norton, you always back off, but you see it.  We're like, look at this motherfucker.  And then we see them talking, having a nice little conversation.  And then the photo I'm about to show you, here, oh, I'll bring it over to you.  Oh, my God.  Nothing.  Oh, my God.  Well, I said to her, I'm like, are you here? 
[01:26:30]  And she goes, oh, I'm here alone.  Oh.  Or she said something like, would it be weird if I was here alone?  I'm like, no, people go out alone.  And I'm like, and then she goes, no, no, I'm here with my friend.  And I could see a guy lurking probably about six or seven feet behind her.  And I immediately knew that that's the guy she was with by the way he was standing away.  It was a crowded area, but I just knew.  And then he kept trying to get her attention.  She was ignoring him.  Oh, no. 
[01:27:00]  She was, like, talking to me.  He's like, do you want a drink?  And I'm like, your friend is talking.  And then she goes, okay.  And then he needed her ID.  And then to give her the drink, like, she just kept turning around and talking to me.  But I literally didn't know.  But look at the friend.  He was a fucking, he was an 11.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, okay.  Look at how tall, look how much of a man he is.  He was a real man.  He was really well built.  His arm is the size of one of his thighs.  Oh, shit, man.  But I'll tell you, honestly.  He literally looked like he rolled out of the Captain America super soldier machine. 
[01:27:30]  But I didn't give a fuck about him, though, because she was totally ignoring him and talking to me.  But then he came up.  He was very nice.  He wasn't a dick.  But it was like, I don't know if they're boyfriend and girl right.  Enough explanation, dummy.  We made fun of him for around 45 minutes.  Oh, shit.  We trashed little fucking goat boy.  Oh, that would have been, you know what?  That's a perfect situation.  We started going, hey, stop sucking your stomach in, stupid. 
[01:28:00]  I did catch a beating.  Keith, I wanted it for the record that I did establish immediately that I knew.  Right.  His posture went from, he tried to make shoulders, he made shoulder pads with napkins, like five  napkins.  You kept saying that.  You kept going, I knew.  I knew the whole time.  I did.  And Keith was doing classic Keith Robinson during a trash shit.  You knew nothing.  Shut up, you fucking trap.  We're not finished yet.  You knew nothing. 
[01:28:30]  And Jim would go, no, no, no, I'm saying Keith would go, shut up until we're finished.  I wouldn't be caring if they were standing right there.  The guy and girl were right there.  They were still a foot away from us.  They could hear everything.  They could hear everything we were saying.  But here's the thing.  That broad, she was downstairs right when you, Aziz, got off.  She tried to come out and go upstairs.  And the guy would let her, because you can't just leave the comedy cell.  You need a stamp receipt.  He's like, no, I need a stamp receipt or your waitress.  She goes, well, my boyfriend's inside. 
[01:29:00]  So I thought she was going up to see Aziz, but she might have been going up to see you.  But then he wouldn't let her up.  She tried to sneak away from her boyfriend while he was in the show.  And then when you left, she sat down next to Keith.  Yeah.  And tried to, like, get on with Keith.  And Keith told her to beat it.  She's not, I don't think she's.  She said, get out.  Come on, what are you doing, little girl?  Get the fuck out of here.  I don't think she's out to fuck somebody.  Here's what we're talking.  And she's like, I'm such a big fan, like, of Aziz and you.  And she's a comedy fan. 
[01:29:30]  I'm such a big fan.  Well, not of you, of the whole genre.  No, but she was like.  Thanks.  And then she goes, I wouldn't mind working here.  Like, she's one of those girls who's really hot, but is literally just a huge comedy fan.  Fuck her.  But it wasn't her.  I stopped making excuses for her, Jim, and for yourself.  You're going to waste my fucking time.  I'm such a big fan of making my boyfriend jealous.  I'm trying to suck famous cock.  This fucking guy works out every day as a fucking Adonis, and he looks like a piece of shit in front of a bunch of nothing. 
[01:30:00]  That's good for us.  No, no.  What I'm saying is, I'm not justified.  I'm saying that's how I felt like, okay, I wouldn't have fucked her.  I wouldn't have had a shot of fucking her anyway.  Because she wasn't, they weren't fuck vibes.  She would have fucked you.  Are you out of your mind?  No.  She would have fucked you.  If you paid her the right amount of money, she would have fucked me.  But that's the type of girl that never fucks me.  Now, you didn't even think of a comedy fan.  That's the type of girl that never fucks anybody.  Like, she's there to make her boyfriend.  What she was doing was the whole, like, look at me.  I'm talking to the comedians.  Sucker. 
[01:30:30]  Like, she was doing that whole fucking thing.  No.  You got low self.  Dude, the girlfriends you've had and the chicks you bang are fucking smoking.  I don't mean that.  I mean, but that type of vibe, when a girl comes up to me and then they're like, I would love to work here.  They're looking, like, here's another example.  I was at the cellar one night and there's this fucking smoking, sexy fucking blonde who keeps looking over at me.  And I was at the table by myself and I actually just waved her over.  Because she was at the bar with her girlfriend.  So I waved her over.  Come here.  She sat down.  It turns out she was a Canadian stripper.  And she was really attractive. 
[01:31:00]  And she was flirting with me.  But I knew it was too good to be true.  Because that's not the way chicks that fuck me act.  I know how girls that fuck me act.  And it's not the hot girl that comes up and just starts.  Nope.  No.  Because I know what I look at.  If I'm Russ Meneve maybe, but I'm Jim Norton.  That's not going to work.  So I'm like, okay.  So it turns out she's a big comedy fan.  She was loving being at the table and talking to the comedian.  Oh, I love Colin.  Oh, I love it.  She just loved us all as stand-ups.  And was never going to fuck.  How long did it take you to tell her to get the fuck away from you? 
[01:31:30]  No, we talked for a while.  But then she went on to the downstairs.  But she was a little too eager to find out where she was sitting downstairs.  So I helped her.  And I wound up going to lunch with her and her friend.  But knowing that it would never go anywhere.  And I'd never lunch.  Yeah.  Why not?  Because it's like there was no reason not to.  She was nice.  No, no, no.  But you've got to take a shot.  You have to take a shot.  But I proved myself right.  It is, though.  I'm absolutely right.  And she wanted nothing to do with it.  But you've got to take a shot.  You have to.  But I confirmed that I was right.  But I confirmed that I was right.  The chick last night, you never even thought of maybe asking for her number? 
[01:32:00]  I did immediately.  But the guy was.  I wanted to know what the status was with the guy.  But who cares?  Nah, I don't do that.  Because I don't want to make him humiliated.  It's not even afraid of being angry.  I saw the picture.  Fuck him.  Let him feel humiliation.  But he didn't do anything.  He was a nice guy.  I felt bad for him to have to deal with that shit.  Because I put myself in a guy's shoes.  He was like, that's embarrassing when your fucking chick is rapping with everybody.  It's like, shut up.  Good.  Good looking fucking cunt.  Fucking no mercy, Kumiya, today. 
[01:32:30]  Every fucking person we bring up, fuck up that cuck, sucker.  I guarantee he has his other women out trying to net that bitch right now and bring her  back to the compound.  But you can see the way she, it wasn't just me.  She wanted to talk to.  Release her in the back.  Go swim in the pool.  She wanted to talk to Aziz.  She wanted to talk to Keith.  Anybody on the show, I just happened to be the first one she spoke to.  She was using all you guys to fucking get her boyfriend jealous.  There's that whole thing going on where she feels she's got to keep him on his fucking 
[01:33:00]  toes.  Because she was a hot chicken.  He was a good looking guy.  He left.  He left pissed.  Oh, did he?  No, dude.  You're wrong.  He was fucking annoyed, dude.  She sat with Keith.  Was it her boyfriend or her guy, though?  She went from you to Keith.  That's pretty fucking bad.  Either way.  It was a boyfriend.  Yeah.  And here's the thing, though.  Even if it wasn't her boyfriend and it was just some guy that she was with, she knew  the fucking score.  It's that fucking thing.  You know, there's drunk chicks in the lobbies at the comedy clubs after the show.  They're hanging all over you.  They got a rock the size of their fucking eyeball on. 
[01:33:30]  Or it may have just been her friend.  What the fucker who she's friends with?  There's nothing like busting a nut on a wedding ring.  Oh, shit.  Watching her clean that thing off in the sink.  Just blurka, blurka over her hand and pours over there like fucking drizzle, strudel drizzle.  Strudel drizzle.  That's disgusting.  Like the ones you can make yourself.  Like strudel drizzle.  You whore.  I don't believe that chick was going to fuck up.  She was too eager to talk to another comedian. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  She wants to work there.  She probably wants to do stand-up.  Another?  She's one of those fucking chicks that really loves comedy.  She disrespected her fucking guy.  I know.  I didn't like that either.  He left pissed off.  Did he leave with him?  Yeah.  No, they left together, but she wound up leaving.  But he was like, you know, he was fucking angry.  I didn't like that either.  I didn't like that either.  I didn't like that either.  I didn't like that either.  I didn't like that either.  I didn't like that either.  Come on.  I'm so fucking tired of girls doing this.  And I've been in that situation where I'm the fucking idiot standing there.  Of course you have.  Except I don't have...  I'm just going to insult myself. 
[01:34:30]  Let me get you.  There is nothing more uncomfortable, man.  There's nobody faster than Norton.  Oh, yeah.  Look out.  Norton is lightning fast.  I saw his fucking eyebrow twitch as he started to speak.  He does.  He starts fucking shaking.  Like he's having a premonition.  Like shaking bake or something, right, guys?  Exactly, Chip.  And then he does that.  Fucking hate Chip.  But it's...  I'm so tired of that shit.  Like, chicks will do...  Not all chicks, but a lot of chicks will do that. 
[01:35:00]  And you're sitting there, and they're doing that.  I'm going to make you jealous shit.  Dude, it's so uncomfortable.  I've pulled the car where I go, hey, fuck you.  I'm out of here.  Yeah.  Wait, why?  What's the matter?  Don't...  I'm just talking.  I'm just...  Yeah, you're just doing that.  If I did it, I'd be a fucking asshole, and I'd be in an argument.  There's no better feeling than actually getting composure on a date with a cunt, and actually  being...  What am I doing?  I did it one time.  A girl picked me up smoking.  I mean, way out of my league. 
[01:35:30]  Smoking hot.  And she picked me up at a Mercedes.  She was from Staten Island.  It's hilarious.  He actually did the joke in his head.  He did?  He held it back.  Jimmy, can I guess it's the joke?  I guess what you were going to say.  It came after it picked me up with.  I know.  Was there a forklift in there?  I actually thought it was out of my league.  I had a couple for those.  That's why you can't even talk around Norton. 
[01:36:00]  We were two lights on Lexington Ave, and she was just a fucking cunt.  And I was like, fuck it, I'm out.  And I just got out of the car at the red light.  And she's like, you'll leave.  And she was fucking one of the hottest chicks ever.  She was just being a cunt.  She wasn't the girl I met two nights ago at the club when she was into me.  She showed up by just being a fucking cunt.  Two lights in, I was like, all right, take it easy, I'm out.  Slam the fucking door and left.  She's like, you're leaving, really?  And then she started switching it around like, what did I do? 
[01:36:30]  Fuck you.  That what did I do shit, fuck you, man.  I'm so tired.  I was in a deli by my apartment one night, and I'm with this girl.  Shut it off, Lauren.  It's not everything that's being said.  It's fucking hilarious, and I know.  You're like a fucking Japanese joke machine.  Shut it down.  I'm not saying a word.  Shut it up, no.  Your face.  Your face.  You just did a joke without doing a joke.  No, I didn't joke.  You did a deli.  Listen to my friend.  You had nine fat jokes waiting. 
[01:37:00]  No?  I did.  So it was with this girl that I had been fucking around with, and she never fuck.  Here's the thing.  I'll pay for everything all the time.  Oh, yeah.  But if a girl doesn't at least go, hey, can I give you?  I just want the gesture.  You know what I mean?  What?  What?  Are you fucking kidding me?  I thought you were going to say he doesn't say thank you.  You know where I stand on this.  We did three podcasts about it.  Are you a chiseler?  No.  No.  No.  You don't tell a girl to pay for it. 
[01:37:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I don't tell a girl to pay for it.  I'm saying, that's not what I'm saying.  What I'm saying is, if a girl doesn't even go, hey, can I, and then.  I wouldn't care if she tried to pay or not.  No, me neither.  You're alone on this one.  You're alone on a date.  I'll tell you, I think I just didn't say she didn't thank you.  She should say thank you and be appreciative.  Or she should suck your dick or something.  Oh, I think a chick should.  Yeah, I was already mad.  She should not offer you any money for deli food.  I think a chick should always go, hey, do you need, just to go.  To me, that's the way of saying, hey, I appreciate you paying for this right now. 
[01:38:00]  Was she a three or better?  Yeah.  Then you fucking should have been appreciated to her.  This story is probably going to go nowhere now.  Did you want her to reach into her purse, like fake reach into her purse for a couple bucks?  Yeah.  Like we do when we're out with an agent, you have fake reach.  Yeah.  It's a fake reach.  Yeah, do a fake reach as a gesture.  Actually, my agent's fake reach.  I'm the one who winds up paying.  It's hilarious.  I don't like even the thought of that, because if she's saying that she would be willing to pay  for the meal, that means she's not willing to pay for it in other ways through maybe 
[01:38:30]  some physical contact.  Oh, listen.  Hubba, hubba.  We don't all live in fucking J.R. Ewing estates out in Rhode Island, all right?  Sometimes it's a little tight.  You should have a cowboy hat.  You should wear a cowboy hat.  Should I walk around with a cowboy hat?  A big white Stetson.  You don't got to pay for nothing, little darling.  Well, now, foxy lady, why don't you come over mine?  Come on over.  I got keeped on the barbecue.  I got naked girls in the pool, and people in the movie room right now. 
[01:39:00]  Junior, Junior, fetch me some of them ribs.  That's right.  We're going to take over this whole street.  That's my goal.  Well, lovely ladies.  I fucking, as many times as I've been at your house, I have slept in a different room every  single time I've been at your house.  I've never slept there.  You slept there, I've never slept there.  Oh, yeah.  We were fucking disasters.  Are we coming over Saturday?  I guess we fall down the goddamn door.  Yeah, come over.  Can we come over to watch the fights? 
[01:39:30]  Oh, fuck yeah.  Come over earlier.  I'm sorry, did you not ask?  Yeah, I did.  I texted him.  No, no, he texted me.  I'm having a big fucking blowout.  Saturday?  Yeah, yeah.  Can we watch the fights, though?  In the theater, yeah.  Am I going to have to fight a drunk fan?  Dude, when you said fucking die.  No.  And it's a girl?  No.  It could be, yeah.  No, no.  It's going to be a big...  We'll watch it in the theater, the fight in the theater and shit.  Have it all over.  Yeah, well, it will be.  Simulcast it.  It will be.  Put it outside.  It's going to be even...  It's going to be big. 
[01:40:00]  But when Joe was over, I was just getting fucking sick, and I couldn't even talk.  It was fucking horrible.  I had a fever.  I was...  Death's door.  Dude, he's sitting.  I walked in.  I walk in.  He calls me.  I'm in South...  I'm in Trenton.  I was in Trenton doing a show.  I was coming that night.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah, I know.  They said you were coming, then...  I had a bad set at the fucking club.  Oh, bro.  I'll talk about it.  What happened?  I was at Maguire's, which I love.  Oh, right.  The fucking people that own Maguire's, the nicest people they treat...  I've never been treated that nice, but the last show, just drunk, some two drunk 
[01:40:30]  people, and I just wasn't ready for it.  Like, I wasn't prepared mentally.  Wow.  First time in 10 years where I almost lost.  Where I almost was, like...  Wow.  I was going to have, like, just a dead set for, like, 30 minutes.  I've seen you destroy people there.  I...  Dude, it was the other one out in...  Oh, okay.  Out in...  Maguire's.  And this guy was so fucking drunk with, like, six of his pals, and he was just fucking... 
[01:41:00]  You fucking...  Was he yelling at you or each other?  Yelling at me.  Oh, good.  And what did the club do?  Ah, they wound up telling him to shut the fuck up, but I was caught in the middle of  fucking with him, and I just had a bad set, and they got me a ride home, a limo thing  home, so I was like, fuck it.  If I went to your party, I would have done bad things.  I would have ate everything.  Yeah.  And fucking probably just lost my marriage.  Probably would have drank.  I probably would have drank.  Fucking...  I'd still be there right now.  Naked in the pool.  Just doing tech stuff for you around the house.  And Daisy Dukes in a hat. 
[01:41:30]  Nice.  It was a fun night.  Oh, it was definitely fun.  I was at a fucking Trenton.  He texted me.  As I'm...  I'm just doing a benefit with Vinnie Brand.  I'm walking...  We gotta go up and do the thing.  Yeah.  He goes, you ready to go on?  And I go, yeah, yeah, I'm ready to go on.  He goes, can you do a meet and greet after with the charity?  And I go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course, Vinnie.  No problem.  I'm literally...  Two seconds after I said that, I get a text from Anthony.  Hey, dude, we're partying. 
[01:42:00]  Party in this fucking booze, broads.  Come on.  Fucking Trenton?  Yeah.  I go, Vinnie, I can't do the meet and greet.  And he goes, why?  And I go, I gotta go.  Why?  And I go, I just gotta go.  I gotta go.  Were there girls there?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yay!  Guess who's ready?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jimmy's got the biggest boner.  Why?  What are you doing?  I'm in need.  Why?  Jimmy's jeans are pushed out so far.  It looks like it's all bent, too.  Oh, my God. 
[01:42:30]  That's fucking great.  I couldn't tell where the boner was.  I know.  It was erect in three different places.  It was like he had a giant pretzel in his pants.  But you couldn't tell where it began and where it ended.  That sounds funny.  Wow, you really have a...  Yeah.  Are you guys so there's going to be girls there this weekend?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I drove 90 fucking minutes, dude.  I was flying.  I was flying.  Flying from Trenton.  I walk in.  I see Anthony's holding a 16-ounce Catherine and Coke.  And I go, how you doing?  And he goes, oh, dude.  Oh, my throat was gone at that point. 
[01:43:00]  The rum's good for my throat.  And I was like, oh, boy.  You can never get to Anthony's too late.  That's the beauty.  If it's like 10 o'clock, you're like, I got dinner planned.  I'll be over at 1.30.  I'm fine.  We're here.  Rum isn't good for your throat, by the way.  No.  No, it's a pirate myth.  Yeah.  What, are you in pen dance or something?  Oh, Jesus.  It's a wrap is good for your throat.  Take it to me, G.  Anything would have been good, though.  Anything to kill the fucking pain would have been good.  So how about this Saturday night we do this?  We just do us four fucking hand bones. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, just fucking.  And all women.  Just chicks.  No other guys.  Well, that's my modus operandi.  We shut it down.  I can't come on Saturday.  Get a door guy.  Get a door guy.  Only broads.  Only broads.  That's it.  Just broads and us three now.  Chicks.  And stop letting creepy fans in there.  Once in a while, it's good.  But some of those fucking wackos that show up.  Oh, I know.  Well, that one guy we talked to was nice.  I liked him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but fuck him too.  Yeah, there's a couple that are fucking.  I see when they get drunk and they open it, dude, and they start doing, dude, fuck, shut 
[01:44:00]  the fuck up.  Yeah.  It's literally like going to the Playboy Mansion.  Like Anthony's Hefner.  Dude, I know.  And there's fans there and people have certain access to certain parts of the house.  Oh, the people don't.  It's so fucking funny.  That's hilarious.  You sent me a photo of his hot tub with just all broads in it.  And I almost left my gig.  I was like, I was just going to fuck it.  Prorate me on Saturday.  I'm out of here.  It's like the Playboy Mansion if Hugh Hefner was just drunk and screaming the N-bomb at 
[01:44:30]  his fucking house with girls from the Magic Garden and his fucking nine-year-olds.  Oh, shit.  It's not like the Playboy Mansion.  It's like fucking Barfly meets Zoom.  Barfly?  Oh, God damn.  Jesus Christ.  Well, it really, and it's getting, this summer's going to be fucking crazy.  Yeah, the whole thing with, you know, getting rid of the fucking girlfriend for the beginning 
[01:45:00]  of the summer, this is just, it already, it has debauchery written all over it.  Dude, can I tell you, I swear to God, they just did a thing, a happy birthday to Opie  on Fox News.  Opie Hughes is on fucking, happy birthday, oh, it is on, oh, that's a really.  That's hilarious.  Look at the picture they're taking of fucking Opie.  He hates that picture.  Opie, that's actually a real.  It's a photoshopped one.  That's a real, that's a real birthday wish.  I swear to God, I'm not joking.  I saw this picture, and I was like, oh, my God, that looks like Opie, and I saw his  name, I thought he died.  I swear to God, I thought that's what that was. 
[01:45:30]  Wow.  I thought that was like a memorial thing.  That scared the shit out of me for a second.  I thought it was, I thought it was a fake birthday wish.  I thought it was like the ones that the fans do on the news.  That they do for Uncle Paul and stuff.  Yeah, I didn't realize, I was like, oh, they got Opie.  Oh, that's I missed, he meant it.  That's a long neck picture.  Yeah, he doesn't like that picture.  Yeah, yeah.  What do they call it?  They're younger.  I like that picture, because his head was like superimposed on a neck.  Yeah, they, the way his body was, and the way his face was, they had one picture that 
[01:46:00]  they liked the neck down, and one picture they liked the neck up, so they put like his  head on his body, and it, but they didn't cut enough neck off, so his neck looks really  long, he's like E.T.  So, Dice, did they splice two pictures together?  They spliced it.  Like, one was the body, like, let's say you have some fucking pig.  But her face is like cute, you know?  Like I throw a batch in her mouth, and then you got another chick, who's fucking dog-ass 
[01:46:30]  fuck ugly, but her body, you know, you throw some goo in her asshole, you mix and match, you  put them together, and they're all hot, good to fuck in the face, the cunt, the ass, everywhere,  goo.  I could listen to that all day.  Now I'll light a cigarette and smoke the room out.  That's a fucking creep.  Yeah, he's fucking smoked six cigarettes in here.  Oh, Dice is fucking in here smoking.  I thought you can't smoke in here. 
[01:47:00]  You can't!  Dice, do whatever he wants.  You can't!  Sit-com team?  Yeah.  You can't!  Dialogue next to each other?  Oh, I can't laugh.  We're praising neighbors.  That sounds like a very cue card.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  So, wait a second.  Do you know I have to call him?  Sometimes you have to, now when you call Morton's house, you have to talk to many different  people to get to Jim.  Oh, you're a phone call guy, right.  Occasionally.  What does that mean?  That means you don't just text to get your fucking point across. 
[01:47:30]  You gotta, when that phone rings, I'm like, and now I know Bobby knows if you don't.  I fucking absolutely know.  Bobby will know if you just blow off his call.  So, I gotta answer Bobby's call.  Well, here it is, is that if you let it, if it rings more than two times, it's, your phone's  not off.  You can, you looked at it and said.  Phone's not off.  You have it with, you don't leave it at home.  It's not on the cradle.  I've never seen you with, you not having your phone on you.  Right, right.  Exactly.  So, you know.  Yeah.  Fuckers.  Yeah.  I just want, I want everything dealt with in text form. 
[01:48:00]  I hate text.  I love text.  I hate long text people who text like a fucking, you know, a story to you.  No, I don't.  You gotta read in a cab and you wanna throw up.  My brother fucking calls and then I'm like, I don't wanna talk.  I'm not in the mood to talk.  Right.  And then when I don't answer, you leave a voicemail and then text me the whole thing.  And I'm like, well, we could have started with the text.  Bobby absolutely refuses to play by any text, anything, anything. 
[01:48:30]  We have like email chains about the book.  Everybody's like, I think this, I think this, I think this.  Phone rings.  Bobby Kelly.  You know, dude.  The new me fucking chain thing where it keeps all the emails in one.  I know, it's confusing.  Yeah.  It fucking blows.  You don't like that?  Well, it's fucking eight things and you gotta scroll back.  But you go through the first email and then you get all the ones. 
[01:49:00]  This is why it sucks.  Because if you send me an email, you're the original email, and then he starts tagging  it and no one jumps in.  It changes.  So if I go to search for it, it's not under your name anymore.  It's under Jim's name.  And then if he's, now it's on, now it's not under Jim's name.  It's under Joe's name.  So it just keeps changing the actual original name.  So you can't search for it or look for it.  Oh, that doesn't sound good.  Yeah.  Fucking blows.  If it's kept the original name and inside of that, you can see it.  I just don't get back to anybody on email.  So it doesn't matter.  No, you really are just a fucking.  I just, I'll text you. 
[01:49:30]  I'll text you.  That's the best way to get in touch with me is text.  And I'll text you back.  He loves a nice text.  Yeah, he really does love being disconnected.  I love a good text.  Bite with emotion.  He doesn't want to hear your voice.  Hey, man.  He doesn't want any human connection.  Send a text with a picture.  It's great.  If you call him and leave him a voicemail, you'll be like, he hates me.  What did I do?  Because you won't hear from him.  Oh, he makes you the fetching.  And if you text him, he's like, hey, you broke a cherry.  I really get back to you immediately with a text.  Yeah, his text message is good, though. 
[01:50:00]  I'm just like, ah.  I like Anthony's text message.  Oh, they're full of emotion.  In the summertime, Anthony's text is a good one.  Oh, right, right.  I've sent a few pictures.  Oh, there's nothing better than a fucking Anthony text message with a pic in it.  Like, here we go.  As soon as I always check my phone, if it's Anthony text and then my wife, I throw my  phone.  Yeah.  Oh, God bless you.  Interesting song.  Fuck, dude.  Should be fun.  Yeah, well, you know, are you a texter or a talker, Jim? 
[01:50:30]  Much more of a texter.  Yeah.  Much more.  Yeah.  I mean, I get it, but I only call you once in a while.  I'm pretty good on the phone with talking.  You're great on the phone talking.  I love texting.  But how fun is the conversations?  I've had nothing but fun laughing conversations with you.  You know what?  I never have a bad conversation with Bobby.  I'm not sitting there going like, fuck, get off the phone.  We are.  We laugh a lot on the phone.  You make me laugh.  But it's getting, it's initially picking up that phone and being like, ah.  Making me human contact.  Yeah, I know how it's hard.  Yeah.  Because you were molested. 
[01:51:00]  I was.  By a guy that looked like me.  A Mexican.  That Mexican guy.  He almost molested me.  He wanted to.  I was kidding.  I was joking.  No, no, there was a Mexican guy that wanted to molest me.  Really?  He was all drunk at a party at the ranch one day.  And he goes, he comes up to me.  He goes, hey, how you doing?  I'm like, oh, I'm okay.  He goes, hey.  And then he just kept talking.  He was all drunk.  And he goes, what do you say me and you go into the bushes over there?  Oh, jeez.  You went old school.  I was like, I was like all shocked and stuff.  So I just kind of, and my father heard that. 
[01:51:30]  And he lunged over, grabbed the guy's head, and just started banging it off of some guy's  old Ford pickup truck.  And he turned out to be one of the uncles of some of the Mexican guys that were at the  party.  And in the bushes there was presents and chocolates for you for your birthday.  You mean when you were a kid?  Yeah.  I thought you were talking about a compound party.  And I was like, get your dad there and he pegged a Mexican dead on a truck.  Do you think I...  I swear to God, I thought that's what you meant.  Do you think he'd turn down a Mexican guy at his party? 
[01:52:00]  You know, first of all, I would have just said, I don't know why he'd do that.  First of all, I would have said, yeah, the bushes, get to work in the fucking bushes.  You prick.  That's what I hired you for.  He was the uncle of some people?  He was the uncle of some people that were there at the party.  So they were like, oh, Joey, Joey, what are you doing?  And he's like, this motherfucker, you know, trying to fucking pick up my...  I'm trying not to make him a fag son.  Did they pick you that up?  No, no, no.  They were cool with it.  They really were pissed at the uncle.  I'm trying not to make him a fag. 
[01:52:30]  You guys are really making it difficult.  Yeah.  It's like, come on.  I just fucking...  Now I got to put another three weeks in just for this one episode.  This kid's been begging me for roller skates for six months.  De-queer him.  He throws up when he watches baseball.  Yeah, that was like, that was a, that was a, like, I was just shocked.  Like, what was, what?  How old were you?  17, 18?  Yeah, I was driving.  Yeah, you were in the barn fucking rubbing a horse vein mule.  Yeah, I was probably 13. 
[01:53:00]  Your dad didn't know that you solicited the Mexicans?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I fucking put a burrito in my pants.  Hey, come here.  You dipped your penis in the cuervo so it smelled like the worm so he'd eat it.  Chew you a little cock.  Little.  Aw.  Nah, he, uh, yeah, yeah, that, that freaked me out though.  I was like, what the fuck?  Like, that never happened as far as I remember.  Didn't, didn't make your self-esteem feel good though?  Yeah, it kind of felt a little good.  The men were fighting over you.  The Mexican guy wanted to take me to the bushes and probably kill me. 
[01:53:30]  Fucking murder me.  After.  After, yeah.  After I'm sodomized.  He'd probably fuck your throat and then choke you out of guilt.  Oh, yeah.  With a scarf.  I'd have been, I'd have been dead in some fucking Orange County riverbed flood control.  Fucking viaduct.  No, I was, I was, I was very shocked though.  But it was kind of cool to watch my father beat the shit out of the guy.  That was fun.  I never got, uh, molested, man.  I never even got approached.  Not even approached?  No.  Yeah.  I hope those memories come flooding back in the wrong time. 
[01:54:00]  I don't like that he said it like he's kind of bummed out.  Yeah, like, ah, I never got to it.  Nobody ever tried to fuck me.  No, I never tried to fuck me.  I think it could have jarred loose a novel or something.  I think there's more art deep down in there somewhere.  I need something to bring it out.  Yeah, it could have jarred loose some good fucking creativity.  Yeah, I would have got that folk album out when I was 18 that I was trying to write.  It would have been the first song.  Yeah, I would have write Tori Amosi, Somebody Touch My Cooter songs. 
[01:54:30]  Joe DeRosa singing, I trusted you.  Yeah, I, I, I, did, uh, did you give him a listen?  Joe DeRosa singing one more time in the bush.  Get it for me one more time, you fucking Mexican.  In the bushes.  Yeah, that guy wanted me.  Who wouldn't?  I was a tussleable little lad.  Do you have any pictures of you when you were a kid?  Anywhere online? 
[01:55:00]  That was a lot of pictures, Anthony.  A little tater tot.  Of a little kid?  Yeah, I think so.  I've seen the one of you when you were in your fucking metal stage with that awful fro.  That was terrible.  He was beautiful.  Just unconditioned hair.  Unconditioned.  Looked like a fucking haystack.  It was just awful.  But then, but no, before that when I was like a little kid, uh, yeah.  But I was such a little fucking, like, wimpy crybaby.  I was just always crying about something.  Oh, God.  Really? 
[01:55:30]  My stomach hurts.  The lunch I got was bad.  Oh, God.  It's all making sense.  Oh, yeah.  I wish I knew that, Anthony.  No, it was all.  That's still Anthony.  This is just a facade.  This gun-toting facade.  There's a scared little boy.  There's a scared little boy behind the walls of that compound.  Yeah, he just wants a chick.  Anthony's Ricky Schroeder.  He's just a loathsome dove.  Loathsome dove one and two. 
[01:56:00]  I was a little, like, just a little fucking married kid.  You're a little newt?  I was terrible.  Just sad that the champ was dead.  Yeah.  Oh, dude.  You're fucked.  No, I've dealt with it.  Sure you have.  Yeah, you've got a fucking arsenal.  And you fuck 18-year-olds.  You've dealt with it.  Yeah.  Fucking get shit-faced on every Friday and Saturday till Monday.  Anyway, you're dealing with it.  But what?  Is that me dealing with it?  No, that's you enjoying your life now. 
[01:56:30]  I realized, like, after a while, like, I was just, I think I was crying because my parents  argued all the time, and I figured that was a good way to make them stop arguing.  Right.  Was by getting all, you know, my stomach hurts.  And they'd just be like, okay, shut up.  Row, you're a bitch.  Joey, shut up.  Go fuck yourself.  And I'd just be crying.  I don't know.  I always cry.  How did you deal with it?  That's fucking sad.  I don't know.  So, I guess I just grew out of it.  I have no idea.  Did you?  Something tells me you're trapped at 18. 
[01:57:00]  But I'd love to see something just crack, Anthony.  Like some TV show.  Yeah.  Some emotional penguin show.  Something just make you crack and see you well up.  And then the pain from your childhood opens up.  And then your whole life changes.  The only thing that really gets me are those, like, watching the old war documentaries and  seeing, like, an old soldier start crying about fucking, you know, he gets like, and  then he came in and he was carrying the, you know, bob and, like, that stuff. 
[01:57:30]  That gets me.  Anthony cries where he's supposed to cry.  You well up when they start talking about Charlie.  When they start talking about Charlie.  You find that touching?  Yeah.  What do you mean Anthony cries when he's supposed to cry?  I think that it's acceptable to cry because Anthony, I think, he's probably much more  emotional than he lets people know.  Really?  Yeah, I think you're deep down a much nicer guy.  Deep down I probably am.  I think so.  I got to get that out somewhere.  But he does all this man stuff.  Like, you know, he fucking has a gun and he's a fucking guys guy and NRA and he only  cries at the war vets.  Because all guys, no guy calls you a faggot. 
[01:58:00]  Everything Anthony does is to prevent being called a faggot.  No guy calls you a faggot if you cry watching a war documentary.  Well, that's true.  Like, you're allowed to watch a veteran get, if you watch a World War II veteran cry and you  get choked up, that's acceptable to other men.  Right.  But if you could cry watching fucking, you know.  Sophie's Choice.  Yeah, exactly.  Or something, yeah.  I cried during The Voice.  The Voice.  Did you?  Oh, God.  What's wrong with you?  I don't know.  You might have.  You're a fucking creep.  You're absolutely right.  I do.  I cry. 
[01:58:30]  I do cry a lot.  I cry a lot.  I cry at fucking anything.  Do you think that was, like, from years of my dad trying to, like, defag me?  Your whole life is built around not being a faggot.  Yeah.  That's what, you have an emotional checklist in your head.  Anything you want to do.  Will this make me a faggot?  Wow.  If no, you do it.  If yes, you avoid it.  Will colored shirts make me a faggot?  Yes.  Dark blues, grays and blacks.  Yes.  Will dressing like a battleship make me a faggot?  No, it won't.  So I'll dress like a...  A battleship. 
[01:59:00]  What's that?  I'll dress like a...  No.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  You really are.  You do have a checklist.  You're trying not to be a faggot in your 40s.  I didn't realize that.  Yeah.  How does that happen?  I'll tell you how it happens.  Just suck a dick and get it over with.  Stop fighting it.  Yeah, should I?  No.  It's coming sooner or later. 
[01:59:30]  You haven't lived until you can't blow air out of your nose.  It's all the way in the back of your throat.  You're like, Jesus Christ.  Bobby's getting sick just thinking of that.  No, he's not.  No, I'm getting a heart on it.  He's getting excited.  Do you want to hear something that will make Joe jealous?  Oh, this made me so happy.  It's got to be something to do with Bailey J.  Oh, this broad.  She makes me so, so fucking happy.  Bailey, yeah?  She, I mean, look, man.  She's fucking smoking.  I don't give a fuck what you say.  She's smoking.  And now that I'm friends with her husband, it kind of ruins it. 
[02:00:00]  Why?  Nah, because now I can't fucking.  I know.  I can't watch her videos anymore.  It kind of.  Yeah.  I feel like bad.  I feel like I'm looking at like my sister-in-law or something like that.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's weird.  I just don't have like the right feeling about it.  Yeah, it fucking.  I don't know.  That's insane.  What are you, that fucking friendly?  What do you call me, a faggot here?  Yeah, see?  Don't cry, Joe.  Bailey J here.  As we all know, Bobby Kelly is super gay for my dick. 
[02:00:30]  So it was no surprise when we all heard that the Bailey J show was moving to the Ryecast Network.  So if you like real conversations and fake tits, I'm your man.  Literally.  So listen to the Bailey J show right now.  Oh, she's a fucking.  Wow.  She said that.  I got this promo.  And she goes, I didn't know what she was going to say.  Everybody knows that Bobby Kelly is super hot for my dick.  I just, my dick plumped up.  Wow.  My wife giggled like it was funny.  And I just went, ha, ha, ha.  You really want to like blow Bailey J? 
[02:01:00]  I don't want to.  I want to fucking start off a little kissing.  I don't want to just get right into the fun of that type of guy.  But it will get to that point where you would go down on Bailey J.  Why are you going to make it dirty?  Because we've discussed this before a bunch of times.  And it usually gets to the point where we try to figure out how far someone would go.  Let's, let's, let's not start with the least homo in the room.  Okay?  Dude.  Let's.  I'm the one who's married.  Okay?  I'm.  What does that have to do with it?  Exactly.  So is John Travolta.  Yeah, I was just going to say.  Ah, sorry.  Oh. 
[02:01:30]  Can I say.  He's trolling for big black cock.  As we start to talk about this, can I tell you, I was at my cousin's wedding this weekend.  And my uncle, my uncle who I've told, he's always like, my friends at work, they like  ONA and they listen.  And I'm like, oh, don't ever listen.  Just don't ever listen.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  So he comes up to me at the wedding.  He goes, he goes, you know, I heard you on Opie and Anthony.  And I go, okay.  And he goes, I listened to the episode from when I was.  And I go, okay.  And I couldn't remember when it was.  And he goes, you remember what you were talking about?  Like that.  Oh, great.  And I was like.  Thanks. 
[02:02:00]  Here we go.  It's going to be the Bailey J thing.  My uncle's going to hear that.  Oh, no.  I'm saying I'd blow Bailey J.  Yeah, you know what your uncle hears.  And I'm just braced.  And he goes, you're talking about Billy Joel and how he stinks.  And I was like, oh.  Thank God.  One of the most innocent things that we talked about.  I.  Wow.  I don't want to blow Bailey anymore because I'm friends with her husband.  Yeah, no.  Yeah, he really did.  Don't throw in the little fucking like personal reasons.  You wanted to blow Bailey J.  I didn't want to blow her, man.  He never wanted to. 
[02:02:30]  I didn't want to blow her as much as he did.  Oh.  But I would.  If she.  I would.  If she.  I'll say she.  If she got you in bed.  Yep.  You.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Go ahead.  You would do anything at that point.  Here's a scenario.  You're there.  Here's a scenario.  I'm up there.  Okay.  Upstate New York near where they live.  Matt and everybody's up there.  All of a sudden the tornado hits.  Some bad shit happens.  He's got a whole fantasy.  I fucking.  All of a sudden.  Tornado hits.  The fucking. 
[02:03:00]  I.  Oh my God.  It's crazy.  We look fucking Matt.  He's flown fucking away.  Oh shit.  He's dead.  He's gone.  And then I got hurt.  She's hurt.  But I take care of her for a couple of days.  Because nobody's around.  So I take care of her.  Like misery.  Yeah.  And then.  You hobble.  Hobble Bailey J.  I have to hobble a she-male just to get it.  Just let her suck her cock.  Oh God.  She's tied down.  You're sucking her cock.  I'm going to put popsicle sticks on the side of it.  Because she can't get hard.  But Joe. 
[02:03:30]  I mean.  You.  Joe.  No.  I wouldn't need a stow storm or nothing.  You wouldn't need a stow storm.  A stow storm.  A stow storm.  You are really turned on.  You private dust.  You cock a sucker.  I just started thinking about a bunch of white stuff.  But I got excited.  That's the only part that would fucking.  I think would make me gag.  Is jizz.  As a guy.  It probably should.  You know.  It's it.  Don't act all high and mighty little faggot. 
[02:04:00]  I'm not high and mighty.  I went through man training.  I learned not to cry or.  Suck a dick.  Be a fag.  Be tempted.  My dad taught me.  I can't wait until somebody's in your basement yelling outside to you on the jacuzzi.  And we can't get the karaoke machine working.  And all they hear is.  Oh.  Be right in.  All right.  Because that's what I'm going to be doing.  I've been sucking dick in my jacuzzi.  Look.  If it's going to happen. 
[02:04:30]  That's where it's going to happen.  We all know.  I think.  Where else would you do it?  You're going to get sick of it.  You're going to get sick of it.  All this pussy you're getting.  You're going to get sick of it.  And you're just going to have to.  You're going to have to advance to cock.  Oh no.  Oh God.  First it's going to be just getting the head from a girl with a dick.  And then all of a sudden.  A girl with a dick.  Then it's going to be.  Just let me see it.  Let me see it.  You're going to pull it out with one finger.  A little hook.  Index finger.  Look.  He knows the move.  Because he's done it.  Yeah.  You've reached in and pulled a fucking dick out with an index finger. 
[02:05:00]  Bobby talks with such intimacy.  Of you.  I mean I'm not saying this.  I really believe in my heart that you've sucked a nice dick in your dick.  I believe you have too.  And yes Jim.  You too.  I never have.  I swear to God.  Stop it.  But I don't know the tricks of.  You know.  I would just yank it out.  I don't know what the fuck.  What do you mean?  And you just roughly yank a cock out of a panty.  See what I mean?  You know how fucking awkward. 
[02:05:30]  And like.  Like.  Like.  Even being sexed up.  Do you know how awkward and guilty you'd feel like.  With that falling zipper.  Just trying to pull a cock out of a pants.  They don't wear zippers.  What?  You blowing a guy?  Dude.  What are you doing?  Are you blowing a guy?  So are you.  No.  They wear dresses.  It doesn't matter.  You're blowing a guy.  There's a big difference.  Believe me.  There's not a guy.  What were you talking about with the fucking finger pulling?  Well the panties.  The little g-string panties.  You're not going to fuck it.  Look at it.  First of all.  If you have to unzip something. 
[02:06:00]  Like fucking gap jeans to get to a dick.  You're fucking gay.  Yeah.  What are you guys doing?  Sometimes you gotta unzip gap jeans.  The g-string part that's gay.  Not the sucking a dick part.  Absolutely.  When they walk into your room from the bathroom and they have a fucking skirt on and there's  a cock hanging below it.  What are you going to do?  That's the young lady.  I'll tell you right now.  If I ever suck a dick, I demand that I have to pull the zipper down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because that's like unhooking the bra strap.  It's like.  It really is.  It's part of the.  Here we go.  Yeah.  Joe needs button flies, you faggot. 
[02:06:30]  Oh my god.  Yeah.  Those fucking buttons open.  That's too many.  Come on.  Joe wants to blow a cowboy.  He wants to undo a belt buckle too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He wants to blow the brony towel guy.  Jimmy's got to go.  Yes, I have to.  So we'll take a quick break.  I'm taping something.  And we'll be back still with Joe DeRosa.  He's going to be here, of course, and the lovely and talented Bobby Kelly.  And I guess Sam is just sitting here and working the board today.  Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.  Which is nice.  Tattooed Sam.  And we'll be right back after these words.  Series XM. 
[02:07:00]  This is the OPN Anthony Show.  Show.  Show.  Oh, a bunch of fucking pigs.  Good God.  I know.  No, you're a very good boy, Bobby.  Oh, Bobby's close to me now.  I feel weird.  I was usually way over there.  I love that we had therapy with Anthony today.  Yeah.  We got one step closer.  It's a little therapy with me.  I'm a weird guy. 
[02:07:30]  I know.  We're all fucking weird.  But the thing is, I've reached a point in my life where I really don't have to make excuses anymore for anything.  I don't care.  This is who the fuck I am.  I've been this guy for quite a while.  Right.  And if you don't like it, lump it, I say.  So, you know, I rarely put up with shit anymore.  I put up with shit for so fucking long just to keep from getting into arguments.  And, like, keep things nice.  Oh, keep things nice.  Somebody, like, says something to me or texts me something. 
[02:08:00]  I'll be like, oh, well.  Now I'm just like, fuck off.  I've had it.  Yeah, you spend so much of your life keeping the status quo.  Yeah.  Because you don't want everybody to be upset and whatever.  But it's like.  And because fights are fucking, like, arguments are stressful and fights are like, eh.  You know, when you're in a battle with somebody and you get a text and you don't even want to look at it.  Or you get a voicemail and you're like, you don't even want to listen to it.  You're like, ah, I don't want to listen to this because I know it's just going to be something I got to delve into. 
[02:08:30]  You jump into with both feet.  I don't.  I hate that shit.  So now I just end it right away.  I'm like, no, shut up.  Fuck you.  Goodbye.  Right.  Just cut people out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not important people in my life, you know.  Just.  I wouldn't do that.  The rags.  Right.  But, like, the shit that I used to just fucking carry around, like, luggage.  Right.  Now it's just like, fuck this, man.  I just don't have the patience anymore.  I did that with, like, clubs, like doing, you know, because I'm on the road a lot. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  I used to get so much anxiety and I would snap because I was, I cared so much about the shows  being good and the club and the hotel and having it.  You should, though.  Now, I wrote down a list of, like, five things that were important and I told my manager,  just make sure these are done.  That's it.  Oh, wow.  Everything else, I'll take the hit.  And I don't even care anymore.  I go to the shows.  I know that someone got kicked out Thursday.  You know?  I know they gave a free ticket to some twat Thursday and she can't.  Fuck it. 
[02:09:30]  I don't care.  Do your fucking job.  So that shit you don't care about.  I don't care.  Like, even get to the gig anymore.  It's like, if I don't make it, I don't fucking make it.  I used to stress about making it to the gig.  Like, the weather and I got to check this and I got to fuck it.  Now it's like, if I don't make it, I fucking don't make it.  What am I going to do?  I still get the, like, stress coming here in the morning when I leave my house and I'm five,  I leave five minutes later than usual.  I'm like, ah, ah, I got to make up the time.  But it's like, why?  I could come fucking flopping in here at quarter after six and be fine.  Right. 
[02:10:00]  I don't know why.  Like, that shit gets me.  You're like, I really just got to kind of blow shit off and relax.  Chill out.  Yeah.  I'm learning that lesson recently with, like, not, like, assessing the situation after it  all works out.  And I've already freaked out for four days about it.  Yeah.  And I'm just like, dude, remember this.  Remember that.  And every time I'm like, you can't freak out, dude.  It all worked out.  There was no point to worry.  I mean, the best advice you could ever get is assess the worst case scenario.  If you can deal with that, then you're fine.  There's no reason to stress.  Yeah.  And when is the situation ever going to end in you dying or being homeless? 
[02:10:30]  You know what I mean?  It's like, those things are very few and far between.  Yeah.  I used to give a fuck about, like, the middlers and stuff.  I used to get, like, fucking.  Oh, really?  I go in.  I go 10, 20.  Fucking, that's it.  I don't.  I'm not going to eat it.  I'm better than any fucking dummy in front of me.  Jim would have made a joke there, by the way.  That's funny that you made the joke without making the joke.  I made the joke without making it.  You're saying Jim would have made the joke.  Jim would have made a joke. 
[02:11:00]  Genius.  It's fucking genius, ball busting.  It really is, dude.  Yeah, it's fucking.  I don't give a fuck anymore.  It's like, I used to get so.  Who's a.  What the.  Because you have so many shit dicks in front of you.  Yep.  On the road.  Yeah.  Just dropping the mic when it's my show.  Oh, do they do that still?  Does someone think it's cool to fucking drop the mic after they're done?  People, people do a little weird stuff.  And I hate the, when they put their fucking t-shirt sales into the, like a, the joke. 
[02:11:30]  The last joke.  Oh, I can't stand it.  If I see one more guy hold up a piece of merch with a punchline written across it.  And then, my favorite though, dude.  My favorite.  And you, you've, we, you've seen this a million times, I'm sure.  I love when they hold it up and it's got the punchline.  So I've got bumper stickers here that say, daddy don't want none neither.  Where are you working?  The South?  Yeah.  Who has bumper stickers?  Or whatever, you know, t-shirt.  And then it gets nothing. 
[02:12:00]  And it's like, your big joke.  Nobody fucking remembers it, you no-name asshole.  Nobody cares.  How about this though?  How about your act instead of your merch?  I don't mind it when the headliner is fucking going, hey, I got a CD or DVD or t-shirt.  Because he worked fucking 20 years to become the guy.  Yeah.  But when you're the MC or the middle guy, and you're fucking holding up a DVD that you made in the basement, fuck you.  It's just too easy these days to make and distribute merchandise. 
[02:12:30]  So anybody can do it.  But here's the deal.  If you, why is your DVD that you made in your basement that's 35 minutes of your best shit?  And my CD that I, it took me 20 years.  I got a fucking record deal.  I had to have somebody actually like me and they made it.  And I'm the guy.  I'm the one fucking doing all the heavy lifting.  Right.  And you get to sell your shit for the same price as me?  Go fuck yourself.  I don't, I don't, oh sorry. 
[02:13:00]  And a DVD.  They have DVDs.  I don't have a fucking DVD.  How the fuck?  I don't even know you.  And if I don't know you, in my eyes, you're not a comedian.  That's my rule.  You've been around long enough.  If I don't know you, then you're really not a comic.  You know what I do now to fuck with guys?  When I plug my CD at the end, I go, I go, so we're both selling CDs.  I mean, you can buy his that he pressed at home in Xerox copies for, Comedy Central put mine out.  Whatever, it's your choice.  It's up to you.  Don't you buy his, fuckers?  Just to mention, too, we do have a Dangerous Joe t-shirt for sale on riotcast.com. 
[02:13:30]  Yes.  And you know what?  It's funny.  It's a top seller.  As we talk about merch, Bob, I will be selling my CD tonight, tomorrow night, and Sunday night at Caroline's.  Really?  But you, here's the dude, you got your coffee boom shirt.  No, that's the Joe DeRose shirt.  Coffee mug.  Dangerous Joe.  There it is.  Here's the deal.  You fucking earned it, though.  You're the headliner.  Right.  Why the fuck does the, I went one day, the MC had a CD. 
[02:14:00]  Here's the thing.  Wow.  It was like a fucking, it was like a flea market.  I don't, I don't give a fuck if the other guys want to sell shit.  I don't give a fuck if you've got the feature guys, whoever, has a CD.  I don't, none of that bothers me, honestly.  What bothers me is if they have it and it's unwarranted.  Like, if it's a feature that's funny and he's like, look, I made this fucking CD, I'm just  trying to make a couple extra bucks and do what I got, then that's okay.  But it's like guys that are going up there with stickers and t-shirts and bracelets and 
[02:14:30]  they, and they stink.  And you're like, dude, you stink, though.  Your act isn't good.  Like, you're not funny.  Here's the thing, though.  You're missing the point of being a middle guy is that you're actually trying to make  ends meet.  You're trying to make headliner money or trying to make more money.  The way you're supposed to do that is to become better as a comic and become the headliner.  That's why these bringer shows in New York, they kind of fuck these comics.  Back when we started, you had to be funny. 
[02:15:00]  You had to hang at the club, know all the comics, get fucking Donnie Brasco in, and then  get a spot after Chappelle, Jay Moore, Norton, Patrice at two in the morning with the lights  on with five people and do good.  And so the guy goes, that was good, come back, come back Monday.  And then you did Monday, Tuesday, and then you did that for a while, and then you got  to do a Thursday, and then you did that for a while.  Then all of a sudden you got to do a one show on a Friday, and then you, all of a sudden  you're working weekends, and then you go to another club.  It's the progression that you need to become a good comic. 
[02:15:30]  You don't get just to fucking get ten people in the club, and you're doing ten minutes on  a Saturday?  And they're selling merch, and all of a sudden, everyone wants the shortcut to the fucking big  time.  Everyone wants to go viral.  Well, it's, it's, yeah, when I came to New York, and I, I'm not doing it as long as you,  but it's like, when I came to New York, I sat at the Boston every single night, went up  at 1 a.m. on Tuesdays, like literally for three people that didn't speak English, like 
[02:16:00]  not exaggerating, horrible.  I remember the first time I did a weekend, Wayne Rada, who was running the place at the  time, goes, I'm putting you after Patrice.  And I was like, why are you, why are you doing that?  You know what I mean?  Like, I was fucking terrified.  Yeah.  And he's like, because you have jokes.  Patrice tells more stories.  I want you to go after him.  And like, put me in the position where it's like, okay, I have to survive right now.  Dude, I had to go up.  I was at the Boston, my first time doing a weekend spot.  I sat there for three weeks, every night of the week, till two in the morning and never 
[02:16:30]  got up.  Oof.  Okay.  What did you keep coming back?  I had no, I had no job.  I moved to New York.  I had no money.  I had to go.  I had to do it.  That's brutal.  I had the flu.  Okay.  I had the flu.  I just got over it.  Like, I was still shaking or whatever, but I go down, I'm sitting in the back.  Like, Masavia comes up to me and he goes, uh, we, I, I kind of hooked up.  I pulled the train with him the night before, the week before I got two broads to fucking  just fuck us both in a fucking shitty apartment. 
[02:17:00]  But he comes up, he goes, you're going on tonight.  And I was like, oh shit, that's, this is what fucking happened.  Um, Jim Brewer comes in.  I'm supposed to go on.  He goes, Jim Brewer's going next.  I'm bumping you.  I go, all right, fuck it.  Then Chappelle walks in while Brewer's on.  Oh man.  I'm bumping you for Chappelle.  I go, oh, okay.  And he yells.  Then Jay Moore walks in.  I'm bumping you.  You got to go up after Jay.  Jay fucking lit the place on fire. 
[02:17:30]  It was like a competition with these assholes.  And then he goes, all right, you're going after him.  Then Red Johnny and the Round Guy, who was one of the funniest duos back then, I mean,  blew the fucking roof off the place.  The place literally stood up and popped when these assholes got off.  And he goes, all right, you're up next.  You're closing out the show.  He said five minutes.  And you know, this is the comic ego.  I went, okay, that's the ego we have. 
[02:18:00]  Like, okay, I'll do it.  I could do this.  Yeah, I'll do it.  And I did it.  And it was fine.  I didn't kill.  But I did, I didn't bomb.  I did well enough.  I went up with, let me tell you something.  I'm like, what's up, fucking woo, fucking little wild squad.  You fucking woo-hoo.  Good night.  Yeah, yeah.  And I fucking pulled it off.  Yeah, dude.  When I auditioned at Gotham, I went in.  And they go, I was supposed to be on at like 8.15.  I walk in.  It was the old Gotham.  And they go, Chappelle's here. 
[02:18:30]  It was right after he left the show and all that shit.  Chappelle's here.  I go, okay.  They go, he's going to do some time.  And then you're going to go on after him.  So immediately you're like, fucking Christ.  That's 90 minutes.  I had to go on an audition at Gotham during the check spot after Chappelle did 90 minutes.  And I got off stage like, who's it?  And they passed me.  They're like, you pulled it out, dude.  I didn't kill.  This is like you're saying.  It's like, they were like, but you pulled, you fucking held your ground.  That's got it.  That's just got it.  And whatever.  It's like, but that was.  I used to have to do black nights at Boston. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Like, he'd be like, dude, come down Sunday.  I'm like, that's a black show.  Yep.  And he.  I don't know how you do that.  How do you not just turn around and walk out?  You got to do it.  I can't do this.  The black show.  The whole trick with black shows was.  Act black.  What's up, motherfuckers?  Look at that white boy saying that.  They think about it.  I started.  Don't do that.  Don't do that.  I started a black club in Philly.  And it was just like.  That was it.  There was two routes you could go. 
[02:19:30]  You could either go.  I'm the white guy that's going to act like I'm from the city or I'm going to just be brutally  myself and whatever.  And both are hard roads to travel.  Doing the pandering thing is easier, obviously.  But like.  Yeah.  But like once you learn, like if if they started to think you were kind of corny, once you had  that attitude of like, go fuck yourselves.  I'm like, yeah, I'm a fucking geek from this.  What do you want from me?  Then all of a sudden it was like, oh, OK, we respect you.  Wow.  Because you weren't being phony. 
[02:20:00]  There's nothing like killing in front of a black crowd.  When you kill.  Jesus.  When you kill in front of a black crowd, it's it's fucking insane.  Insane.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking crazy.  But how great was that Sunday?  Boston.  Was that not the fucking two shows packed sold out every every week was packed.  But they used to put me on, man.  They used to put me on at the end.  I remember they turned the lights on at the end because they forgot to bring Will.  And he was a guy.  Give it up to this white boy, Robert Kelly. 
[02:20:30]  Like they were angry that you got a spot sometimes.  Like you get shit.  Like, I can bring this motherfucker up.  Wow.  And you go up and you do well.  I'm like, all right.  Fuck you.  Ah, you didn't get me.  I don't know how you fucking that's.  See, you guys don't really exude a lot of confidence.  But but in order to do that, I would think you'd have to be very confident.  We don't have self-esteem, but confidence and ego are a fucking we have tons.  I was confusing that we have.  We're honest about our self-esteem. 
[02:21:00]  We're shitty self-esteem.  But ego and confidence when it comes to stand up.  Oh, you can go fuck yourself.  I'll go up.  I'll go up, Eddie.  I'll try it.  Perfect sense.  There are women I've tried to bang off of my stand up confidence that I had that I never got.  That guys were like, are you fucking crazy?  But you're like, no, I got this.  I'm on it.  She likes me.  But then, you know, then you go home and you fucking you curl up in a ball with a bucket of chicken. 
[02:21:30]  And you're just like, I wonder if I'd still be having as much fun in my life if I was still just a tin knocker in a little apartment.  Let me answer that question.  No.  Yeah.  You mean you not you fucking not being having your compound and banging bras and TVs in every room, a theater room, all your guns?  You don't think I'd be able to get girls?  No.  Come on.  No.  You'd have a fucking personality.  You would have an unconditioned hair, Long Island fucking shrivel. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Just a fucking big nose.  Now, wait a minute.  Kind of good looking bitch.  I'll tell you the kind of girls you'd get.  You'd get some fat bartender with a rose tattoo on her tit.  I know.  One of those bras.  We all love Rosie around here.  Hey, look at that.  He'd have one of those.  He'd have one of those.  No.  He'd have a blonde.  One of those blonde chicks with a raspy voice because she smokes too much.  And she has just a flat ass with great tits.  There you go.  Really good tits but just flat. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, God.  Yeah.  That's it right there.  That's it.  First of all.  I'm Anthony's wife.  Anthony, get me a fucking Miller.  Oh, God.  Would that be a fucking nightmare?  That's what you'd be.  I wouldn't.  The fatties are out.  I wouldn't be with a fatty.  Oh, yes, you would.  Nah.  I don't think you realize how little of a choice you have in this.  Really?  I'd be that bad?  We all would.  I'm trying to think.  Let me tell you something, dude.  Your chick would just smell of cigarettes. 
[02:23:00]  Parliament 100s.  Wow.  The ex-wife used to smoke Parliament.  There you go, dude.  And she was a bartender.  And she would say, she would say, seen.  We seen Skinner last weekend.  We seen Skinner.  We seen Skinner.  We seen Molly Hatchet.  Her roots would be showing, you know, because she's too lazy to dye her hair anymore.  This is exactly what my fucking ex-wife is.  You're describing that.  Like, that's where I left off. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  And then went into radio.  So is that, would that have been, that's just.  That would have been you, dude.  You would have been fucking coming home around fucking six o'clock.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Dinner wouldn't be on the table.  Because she's fucking passed out somewhere.  Oh, on a couch with some stupid show on.  And a fan because you can't afford electricity.  So you don't have AC.  So you just got fans in the window.  I got the fucking oscillating fan.  Nice pack of merits.  Oh, some little dog.  You'd have a little dog. 
[02:24:00]  I don't like this scenario.  I don't like this timeline.  It's horrible.  You'd have that.  Bobby's like Doc Brown with the chalkboard.  Yeah.  With the timeline.  This is the alternate in 2012.  I like the Anthony that founded.  He'd still have a square TV.  I'd have the big fucking cathode rate tube TV.  With the green, red.  On some cheesy wall unit.  It's got to be five feet away from the wall because of the back is sticking out.  Anthony would make his garage like his little man cave. 
[02:24:30]  He'd have like a couple chairs and a recliner for him.  With some fucking posters of Farrah Fawcett on the fucking nailed into the wall.  Oh, man.  You'd have a shitty car that someday you're going to get back together and drive around.  Oh, man.  Just the muscle car with no wheels.  No wheels and fucking...  Is that...  That would be...  I think Danny found my girl.  There you go.  There you go.  You see?  Yeah, that's exactly who you'd be with.  Look at that. 
[02:25:00]  Look at that.  Nice shit bar.  Yeah, nice tits.  No ass.  Wearing a fuck...  She always wears those fucking champion of the world belts just to hide her gut.  It's like silver and turquoise.  Yeah.  Yeah, from your trip to Arizona when you went there on a fucking couples.  We went to Tempe.  Yeah, you went to...  Yeah, with the Flagstaff.  A fucking retreat.  Hairdue was 15 years out of style.  Yeah, yeah.  She got that fucking 80s hairdo and the blue eyeshadow is like running crazy on her.  She has that blotchy fucking pale skin where it's like red dot, white dot, red dot, white dot. 
[02:25:30]  And the red...  The red lipstick is wicking up the cracks in her lips.  And every day of the week she'd pronounce it with D-E-E.  Friday.  Friday.  We're going to see it in on Monday.  If you remember Wednesday, we seen this other band.  Wednesday.  Wednesday we seen...  Let's not forget that we're actually talking about how shitty his wife would look. 
[02:26:00]  Let's not forget how shitty he'd look.  Let's not forget fatso with no hair.  That's what Anthony would look like right now.  Oh, God.  Anthony would be a fucking...  Oh, just a disaster.  A fucking disaster.  That's funny you calling someone fatso with no hair.  That's kumia.  Wait a minute.  That's alternate time like kumia in the pool.  Oh, my God.  But Anthony wouldn't have a gun because he wouldn't have the money, so he'd have a taser. 
[02:26:30]  I wouldn't be able to afford my guns.  Anthony would have mace, like a collection of mace that he got those Chinese stores at the mall.  Anthony would have Chinese stars.  Yeah, he's going to, like, the head shops buying the knives and ninja stars and shit.  He'd have swords.  Yeah, I'd have a sword.  That's perfect.  He'd have a fucking Conan original sword.  This is terrible.  You'd be the fucking neighbor in office space.  You'd be that guy. 
[02:27:00]  Got to wake my ass up at 6 a.m. every day this week.  Yeah, I'm doing the She-Rock down there.  You've got to see this pair of titties on Channel 9.  I got me drywalling the new McDonald's.  Yeah, I'm doing the drywall down there at the McDonald's.  I'd love to see his pool, too, if he had to clean it.  You know, you'd have an above-ground pool, by the way.  Absolutely.  I will describe what my life was like when I first came back to New York.  I had the bartender. 
[02:27:30]  She wasn't that old yet, but it was gearing up to me.  And I was living in a small house that I was renting off of Huntington Village.  And the back had this fucking broken-down wooden deck that I had one of those pools on.  Like a turtle pool?  Two-foot-tall blow-up pools.  That's it.  That's where you were headed.  You'd have the fucking inflatable hot tub, too.  Yeah, like one of those.  Here's the thing.  You would still be one of the scumbag friends you'd have. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, the scumbag friends I had.  You'd still be the guy.  Dude, Anthony's got a pool.  It's the shed.  Let's go in.  This is what you do.  Get in with a Miller Lite.  I think he'd slide off.  I think the only thing that kept him out of a militia was this radio show.  You think I would have just lost that?  I think he would have slid way off.  You want to go shoot targets?  No, Ant.  Yeah, move to fucking Michigan.  Come on, say those beer cans, honey. 
[02:28:30]  I've got to shoot at them.  He is one argument away from being Ted Nugent and just saying, fuck it.  I just think that time, I don't like that because I know that's exactly where.  I was on the dart league at the local bar.  We used to go like every Wednesday.  Wednesday, we'd go to other bars around the town and shoot darts against them.  And then, you know, we'd have a home game every month or so.  And it was just drinking beer and shooting darts. 
[02:29:00]  I want to mush my banana in your face right now.  Do you know how lucky you are that you got out of it?  You were in a dart league.  I was in a dart league.  I was a cheap metal worker on a dart league where I would go to the ATM because I needed more money for the bar.  And at night, I'd go across the street to the bank and the ATM and take out 20 bucks and hope I didn't take all the money out.  Dude, your fucking Tony Montana story makes me sick. 
[02:29:30]  Mom, look, your son's a big success.  You just fucking...  You got the bullseye now, huh?  Anthony came to this country with a dream and he fucking made it happy.  I made it happy.  Thank God.  No bullshit.  No school.  You know, where is it fucking this?  No, high school dropout.  Just fucking shot right up.  No GED even.  I didn't even get a GED.  You'd have a bad back right now.  Oh, I know.  From lifting all that sheet metal.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  All cut up.  Yeah, you'd know when it's going to rain because of your stupid knees.  Now I got city hands, soft hands for counting money all my life. 
[02:30:00]  Mr. Hooper.  Yeah, you got soft hands and soft little women now.  Think about your life now and then think about what it was supposed to be.  Okay, hold on.  Just a little pool in the back.  The little pool in the back with the wife yelling at me that I didn't take the garbage out.  Yeah.  Smoking.  Smoking.  Don't look at this picture.  Cotton candy hair.  I gotta find a better one.  You know when you try to run your fingers through your wife's hair to give her a kiss and it gets stuck?  Oh, God, yeah. 
[02:30:30]  Just frizz.  Just frizz from dying it too much.  Oh, God.  Don't look it.  Don't look it.  Okay, Danny's finding great pictures.  Think about your life now.  Okay.  Think about your life now.  Really get a good picture of it.  Okay.  And then once it's settled in, I want you to turn and look at this picture.  All right, all right.  I know that's what it could have been.  Hold on.  Here's what I'm imagining right now.  I'm sitting in the jacuzzi.  It's nice, sunny out.  I got myself a nice fucking Guinness in my hand.  And, oh, wait.  Oh, look.  One of the girls are topless and they're jumping in the pool.  All right, they're swimming over. 
[02:31:00]  Now they're climbing up the waterfall from the jacuzzi and jumping in there.  They're just hanging out, drinking and hanging out in the jacuzzi.  All right.  Okay.  She falls, cuts her head on a rock.  She's bleeding in the pool.  You leave her.  I like that.  And this is what it could have been.  Oh, shit.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Oh, my God.  She's wearing a you can't afford me shirt.  She looks like an alien.  That's it.  That's what it could have been.  This fucking woman looks like an alien.  Her face is fucked.  That's what it could have been.  Here's the problem with that.  You would have been with that. 
[02:31:30]  What happens to people, you're with it every day, so you get used to that face.  So that face would have been like, hey, I don't know.  That's my wife.  Are you kidding?  This chick looks like the way Anthony would probably look like Anthony.  You are an asshole.  That's what you would look like if he was still banging tin.  If I was fucking knocking.  Oh, man.  That's somebody we know.  Oh, no.  That's him.  Oh, without the fear.  That's oh.  Oh.  Let's do everybody's timeline.  I want to do Bobby's.  Let's go around the room and do everybody's. 
[02:32:00]  Me and your timelines are the same exact.  If we made it or we didn't make it.  We're exactly where we would have been.  We're banging tin and doing comedy.  We're at the same spot.  Oh, geez.  You know what's so funny, dude?  I was watching.  I bought the season one of Welcome Back, Cotter.  Oh, man.  Great.  And I was watching it.  Barbarino trying to suck Freddy Boom Boom Washington's chair.  Mr. Cotter.  He loves that.  The black cock.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:32:30]  He's trying to fuck me.  That's just how the horsehack gets fucked by Barbarino.  By Barbarino.  Oh.  Oh.  I don't get it.  I love DeRosa, though.  DeRosa's the only fucking ass that would go and buy.  You bought Welcome Back, Cotter.  That's how you love him.  Ten bucks at Best Buy.  I was like, fuck it.  I'll give Welcome Back, Cotter.  I was watching it, and I started thinking about, like, because it's based on, like,  Gabe Cotter's actual guys that he grew up with.  I started thinking about, like, the storyline of, like, the real, because those characters 
[02:33:00]  are much more real to life than you think they are.  Like, they do a pretty good representation of, like, what that kind of kid was like back  then and stuff.  Yeah.  And I just started thinking about the timelines of those characters, where they would be,  and every one of them was dead.  Every one of them.  Just end up dead.  Everyone was like, it's a shame, man.  Freddie, man, he was talented.  He could play ball.  He was a good-looking dude.  He was funny, but he got shot, man.  Shot, yeah, yeah.  You know, it was all, like, every, think about all those characters. 
[02:33:30]  Like, Horshack is the dumbass that hung out with the bad kids because he just needed to  be led.  Yeah.  So he's the guy that's going to OD one day because somebody gives him a bad fucking shot  of something.  Yeah, doing drugs to be cool.  Yeah, exactly, dude.  Well, Washington gets shot.  Uh, uh, Hotsy Totsy gets AIDS.  Oh.  Hotsy Totsy gets AIDS.  Yeah.  Hotsy Totsy.  Seriously.  Seriously.  She tries to fuck Cotter in one of the episodes. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And it's like a goof.  Yeah, it's a joke.  It's just funny.  Oh, the student's trying to fuck the teacher.  Oh, it's the 70s.  Who cares?  You know what would be the best, too, though, is if the other timeline with Anthony, he'd  just be a fan of ours, that we'd fucking sell a CT.  He'd go to one of our shows.  I'd show up.  Hey, man.  And his wife would be like, all right, let's go.  I'd be like, hey, man, I just want to, just give me a sec.  Let me talk to him.  Let's go.  No, she'd be like, why the fuck are you even fucking talking to that prick?  Where's the bar?  Oh, God.  That bad, right? 
[02:34:30]  That fucking bad.  Can I get a pic, Joe and Bob?  That's what you'd say.  Joe, Bob, can I get a picture?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'd be showing all my friends.  Yeah.  Like, yeah, I went to fucking Club, man.  Just fucking Bobby.  I actually, I think I had him laughing at one point.  I did one of my characters.  If I was doing, like, Dice, and Joe DeRosa was cracking up at him.  Why are we fantasizing about this when we could just pop up a YouTube video of  a fan on Stern back in, like, 1991?  What are you talking about?  I was a fanboy.  You never saw it? 
[02:35:00]  Let me see.  I would love to see it again.  I was quite the fanboy.  Really?  I'm listening to all this.  I'm like, this happened.  This already happened.  I really was.  Yeah, but there's a fork in the road that God, the universe, whoever, put in front of  you, and you took it, and now you are in shape, million-dollar man, guns, banging  young broads.  I try.  Being you.  That's the whole thing.  Now you're just being you.  This is the real me.  This is not the real you.  Oh, the real me is the other guy?  I hope three ghosts come to you tonight and fucking take you back. 
[02:35:30]  No.  Listen.  No.  This is not the real you.  Oh, okay.  You're not the real you yet.  What you're doing now, you're going to have to come through the other side.  Oh, shit.  And you'll be, the guy you end up being is not this guy now.  You're going to be another guy before you die.  Yeah.  And you're going to wake up one morning and go, is it too late to get an AIDS test?  I didn't miss it.  Young man, run and get me a home AIDS test. 
[02:36:00]  You're back in half a minute, I'll give you a shilling.  You know, what the fuck would you be doing if you aren't a comedian?  I'm doing it.  I'm doing it.  Isn't that the...  I'll tell you what Bobby would be doing.  Bobby's the kid from Welcome Back, Connor, that they'd be sitting there going, hey, he  is funny and he's a good looking kid, but he's...  I'd be...  He got into some dumb shit.  He got shot.  I'll tell you what...  I'll tell you what...  What skills do you have as far as work?  I'll tell you what I would be some type of counselor because it's easy. 
[02:36:30]  What?  I'd be a counselor, but not with a degree.  You think people just jump into that line of work?  Dude, I was a counselor at 18 at a fucking juvie place.  Yeah, how much did you make?  Enough to fucking keep a roof over your head?  Yeah.  You'd be working in the trades.  You'd be a roofer of some shit.  I would not be a trade...  You know why?  Too much of a pussy.  I did it.  My uncle was a painter at his own paint company.  I worked with him.  I was too much of a fucking puss whack to be a...  Yeah, trade guys, your body is just fucking... 
[02:37:00]  It is a lot of work, yeah.  I would be some type of cheesy counselor.  I'd probably have five jobs, though.  I'd deliver flowers on a Friday.  Like what I did.  Yeah, you'd have a lot of jobs.  Yes.  He'd be the guy with a bunch of jobs.  I disagree with this completely.  Really?  I think he'd be like River Phoenix at the beginning of standby.  He'd say, Robert Kelly stabbed in the neck.  Because you'd try to do something honorable.  You wouldn't have that thing going, don't do anything honorable, stupid.  You got a nice career here.  You'd just be like...  You'd be working with the kids.  You'd be like, I gotta fucking... 
[02:37:30]  I gotta get in there.  I gotta care.  And you'd get in the middle of some shit, try to help somebody.  I'd be dead.  You'd be dead.  I wouldn't be here.  It's a good story.  It's a great story.  I like it.  I like it.  What do you think you'd be doing, Joe?  I know what he'd be doing.  I have no idea.  I'll tell you what he'd be doing.  He'd be back in his little town, the mayor of the fucking town.  He'd probably be working at a coffee shop, right?  Oh, man.  The manager of the coffee shop.  That's almost what I'm doing now. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, wow.  No.  I don't know.  Do you have any skills?  What did you do?  I worked...  You know what?  I gotta be honest, dude.  I don't know where I'd be because I did.  I went to college for video production, like editing and all that stuff.  And my last semester, we had to intern at a production house.  It was mandatory.  And I interned at this place.  And it was a really small place.  And I had a really down-to-earth boss.  But he would laugh at me all the time. 
[02:38:30]  And I was like, why are you always laughing at me?  And he's like, dude, your fucking temper.  If you can't get cables to connect, you're...  He's like, you're just fucking cocksucker, motherfucker.  And I'm like, dude, I had no concept of it.  So I don't think I would have been able to work very long.  And I hated the job, too.  They were very nice people, but I hated what I was doing.  He would have been at like a Sam Ash.  Something like that.  Probably.  Just that cunt.  If you don't know...  Like if you walk in, hey, I'm looking for a...  What?  What do you want?  They're all cunts there, by the way. 
[02:39:00]  They're the worst.  They're all fucking assholes.  They're the fucking worst.  They're worse than gun store people.  They're worse than bike people.  Bike store people are fucking cunts, too.  If you don't know what the new French fucking 10-speed is, you're...  Do you have a water bottle?  What kind?  We have...  Shut the fuck up.  It's usually anything, because even hardware stores, they're all fucking pricky.  It's like, yeah, I need a fucking nozzle.  Sam Ashlow.  We're kind.  Sam Ashlow, music store people.  Because they want to be fucking musicians. 
[02:39:30]  They want to be rock stars.  And they're like, yeah, I need a fucking nozzle.  They're not working at fucking Sam Ash.  I'll tell you, I'll tell you, I know what it is.  The worst.  I know what would have happened.  I know what would have happened to me.  All right.  Joe DeRosa, alternate timeline.  Because comedy was the only thing that let me be angry openly and get it out of my system,  like, where people were like, that's funny.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, whereas everywhere else, they were like, what the fuck is wrong with you?  I would have been headed for a nice fucking American beauty breakdown.  Oh, you think?  I would have stuck it out for a while in some poor shitty office job, and I would have snapped. 
[02:40:00]  I would have actually snapped, and it would have either been gunned down or something,  or, you know, got shot by the neighbor because the neighbor thought I was fucking his kid  because I just wanted to hang out with him.  I think it would be you in a fucking, you trying to lift weights in a garage and then  just putting a shotgun in your fucking mouth.  Wow.  That's brutal.  Jesus Christ.  Now, the Sam Ash thing I like. 
[02:40:30]  I just picture you with Sam Ash selling some fucking kid some guitar.  Guess what?  It's a Shure 58.  It's the most used microphone.  I mean, this is industry standard.  SM means, I don't, look.  I need a cable.  What kind of cable?  Oh, he'd be that kind.  We have a wall of cables.  What do you need?  Look, I like the Sam Ash thing, too, but unfortunately, we don't like where we're all headed in this  alternate timeline because it's not realistic.  You would be in a fucking garbage can.  He'd be dead, and I'd be fucking, I don't know, getting shot or getting gunned down by 
[02:41:00]  the police, by the SWAT team at some shit office job.  Our fucking alternate universe is fucking sick.  They're really bad.  Do you know what, dude?  We get to go home today and go to bed all day.  If we want, all day.  I'm just going to fucking take a nap.  I appreciate the fans.  It makes me love the, you know what?  I'll accept one of you douchebags for fucking critiquing me.  Because if it wasn't for these cunts, we'd actually be in our alternate universes. 
[02:41:30]  I'm going to go home and nap, and I'm going to wake up, and I'm going to go in the jacuzzi  with two topless Canadian girls.  Yeah.  Where?  What are you doing?  What are you, what are you, order them?  Are they there now?  Are they there now?  Yeah.  Who's at the house?  Let me see.  Let me see if I can pull it up.  Oh, God.  You know what?  His fucking universe is way better than ours.  I am sick of it.  They're still sleeping.  I am sick of it.  I don't know.  They're not on cameo.  I hope you go home and all your shit's gone.  And let's remember this.  It could happen.  I hope they're two fucking criminal lesbians from Canada, and that's what they do. 
[02:42:00]  They just find dumb Americans to fucking come over, and they-  That'd be hilarious.  Off all your guns.  Everything is fucking gone, and there's just like red spray paint on all your TVs.  God, would I love that if they just ripped you off like Zombieland?  Oh, man.  Oh, shit, right?  Two girls took your shit and fucking ripped it.  Like, what happened?  They fucking took my shit.  Just remember this.  While you're topless in the pool, while you're taking a nap, while I'm going around downtown  looking for apartments, because my afternoon is free, guess what? 
[02:42:30]  You two and E-Rock will still be sitting here.  Oh, shit.  Because your lives are the same in this or any parallel universe.  I was going to reference that.  You fucking middle roaders.  All my shit's still there.  Oh, man, that hurt.  Fucking dick.  What a dick.  He called them fucking-  There's no alternate universe for you normal fucking middle roaders.  You are a prick.  You have no hopes and dreams. 
[02:43:00]  What the fuck?  Wow.  You guys are looking at alternate universes.  We're just looking to October.  Wow.  I just said it because I knew you would go, what a dick, what a dick.  Look at Sam.  Sam, I'm joking.  I'll tell you what Sam is doing in his head right now.  Just thinking about all his plans that he knows.  Look at you, you fucking ego.  Who?  Ah, look at you.  Out of Sam, E-Rock, and Danny, who is most likely to go on a killing spree?  E-Rock.  At 45.  Danny.  Fuck, it's Danny.  Probably Danny, yeah. 
[02:43:30]  Look, Danny.  No, I think it's E-Rock.  No, E-Rock doesn't have the balls for it.  Danny has the facial hair-  Danny has the facial hair for a mug shop after he killed a bunch of people.  But Danny gets a lot of his rage out.  Like, E-Rock is totally not self-aware, and so at some point he'll snap and not realize  it's coming and just start firing.  He won't know what he's doing.  I don't know.  Yeah, but he won't know how to use the gun.  He'll try to put the magazine in his mouth.  He'll shoot himself in the face by mistake before he does anything.  Try to eat the bullets.  I'd love to see Danny gunned down a fucking K-Mart as people are screaming, 
[02:44:00]  Help!  The guy from System of a Down is open fire with everybody in here.  The lead singer from God's Max gone crazy.  Does he get killed, or do they take him alive?  No, they take him alive.  Here's the thing, though.  They have to do the sketch artist.  He'll be like, what kind of hat?  I don't know, it was a gaze to the side, just to look like half a head.  He didn't have a full head in the hat.  Like, it was...  We get it, you're goofing on his hat. 
[02:44:30]  Did you guys see Bobby's brand new bag that he's been wearing?  Oh.  Because that should be debuted.  What happened to your bandolier?  I don't have...  I still have...  Oh, the bandolier.  Bandolier is a shit.  And you know what?  The funny thing is, so many people got fucking the bandolier.  No, they didn't!  I get email after email.  You are lying.  It's the best for traveling.  No one wants that thing.  Joe, you want a bandolier?  No.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  No, I...  Joe, look at your bag you have now. 
[02:45:00]  Which is the...  Look at Joe's bag now.  But everything fits right in, and it's nice and compact.  That's a little gay, though.  Yeah, it's really good.  Dude, one time I'm walking a little.  See how I did that, Danny?  I'm walking with Burr.  I'm walking with Burr after a show one night in Boston.  I'm carrying this.  Some drunk guy goes,  Hey, look at your little purse, you fucking faggot.  Holy shit.  And then walks off, and I start fucking fuming, right?  Yeah.  And Burr goes, what's the matter with you?  Why are you so angry?  And I go, you didn't fucking hear that?  And he goes, no, what happened?  What happened?  With that fucking face. 
[02:45:30]  What happened?  Joe.  Joe.  And I go, fucking guy just goes, look at your little purse, you fucking faggot.  And he goes, you're carrying a fucking purse.  What do you expect?  Thanks, Bill.  What an asshole.  Guess who traded up that purse, man?  Yeah, this was yours.  Oh, it was?  You fucking asshole.  I forgot.  I got rid of that.  He had a really cool Comedy Central bag.  It was from Montreal.  Montreal bag.  And I was like, wow, that's nice.  I traded up for it.  I got rid of that faggy purse. 
[02:46:00]  You traded?  What are you in fucking fifth grade, you two?  Hey, you know what?  We don't have fucking bags of money, Scrooge.  How's that sound?  Sorry.  We don't have fucking McDuck.  Yeah.  Timeline guys.  We can't just go on the fucking internet and buy Canadian women and fucking cool bags.  Go fuck yourself.  I'm fucking sick of it.  Three minutes ago, these assholes were sitting around a pool fucking getting fanned with leaves and eating grapes.  I'm fucking sick of it.  And now they're like, fuck you, rich guy.  Fuck you.  I'm sick of Anthony's DuckTales life.  Yeah.  I'm fucking sick of it. 
[02:46:30]  Swimming.  I bet he's got a room where he's swimming in gold coins.  Joe's going to look in crack neighborhoods for apartments, okay?  Please.  Please.  Whatever you need.  Let me just live out there with you.  I got enough rooms.  Why don't you let him live out there with you?  I'll get a car.  I'll give you $1,500 a month.  Just let me fucking live out there.  $1,500.  Just to share the life. 
[02:47:00]  Yes, Bob, before you choke.  I'm just looking at little fag Sam trying to put the fucking photo in front of you, and you keep ignoring him.  It makes me happy.  Oh, I didn't notice.  That's anticlimactic now.  Oh, that was...  What bag is that?  It's his new bag.  Oh, that's the new bag.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  At least...  I don't know.  That's like...  It's a backpack.  It's an ass pack.  It's too big.  It's on your ass.  It's nice, though.  It's too big.  Why can't you just get shit, normal shit?  I can't. 
[02:47:30]  It's like, why can't you not buy guns and drink alcohol?  All right.  And fuck girls.  Girls not your age.  I don't like 50-year-old girls.  You're 50?  What?  Nothing.  Listen, let's not get into semantics here.  I don't know.  I like...  That's how...  Listen, you fucking kill your pain with little girls, booze...  No, I don't.  Little girls.  They're all fucking legal.  Let's make that fucking clear.  I don't need goddamn FBI creeping up my ass because you and some other fucking bitch is 
[02:48:00]  saying that I got you.  I'm with underage girls.  Anthony, all those girls...  I never said underage.  All of age.  All right.  All those girls are legal, and they're all old enough to get into Caroline's Comedy Club,  where I'll be performing tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday night.  Very good.  Use promo code ONA to get discounted tickets.  Troops get in for free.  It's Fleet Week.  Troops get in for free.  You should have told me.  I would have promoted that on my podcast that's on riotcast.com.  You know what, dude?  I would have fucking promoted that shit if you...  That's amazing.  You know what? 
[02:48:30]  Maybe I'll come on your podcast on riotcast.com.  You know what, dude?  To promote my new web series, What Are We Waiting For?  on youtube.com slash the warner sound.  Come on Thursday on You Know What Dude on Riotcast.  You know what, youtube.com slash the warner sound.  Oh, now they're fucking getting out of it against each other?  What the fuck is this?  No, no, no.  I just said it again because he talked to him at the plug part.  No, no, I fucking mush-moused them.  Here's the thing.  Wait, what were you guys...  Fuck, here's the thing.  Here's the thing is this.  I kill my pain with that shit. 
[02:49:00]  Buying the new bag, the new hard drive, the new phone case.  You kill your pain with fucking booze and parties.  And chicks with fucking really fair hair.  Just light.  Like it just came in.  Like it's brand new.  Oh, Jesus.  Did you just get hair down there?  You're terrible.  You give them little combs, little mustache combs.  Look, that's the thing though.  The way, Anthony, the way we drink is the way Bobby buys tech shit. 
[02:49:30]  He's got a closet in his house filled with tech shit.  But I always give him shit.  I go, dude, I go, you throw these.  I feel sorry for your gadgets.  You throw them aside like they're dirty whores.  Oh, man.  He has something one week and he goes, dude, it's the best thing ever invented.  Look, you flip it like this.  You flap it out.  You hit this button.  The next week, same fucking device, different company.  Dude, this is the best.  Well, what about the other one?  That one stinks.  It's blue. 
[02:50:00]  This one's pink, dude.  I just bought a fucking crazy treadmill.  What?  It's so fucking cool.  It folds up on itself, but it's like a non-folding treadmill.  So when it goes down automatically without you having to go bend down.  Right.  So you pick it up.  You can wheel it whenever you want.  It goes flat up against the wall.  Then you bring it down and it goes down by itself.  But when it locks in, it's like a solid treadmill, not a folding one.  Right.  The shit. 
[02:50:30]  Are you using it?  The shit.  It's the best for me because I use it at night.  Like last night, I did podcasts.  I did all the shit all day.  I did shows last night.  We hung out last night at the cellar because everybody was there.  I didn't get home until 12.  I jumped on the fucking thing.  That's the hardest part is actually using the shit.  Dude, it's right there.  I unfold it, put my thing on, listen to a fucking podcast.  I did 45 minutes last night.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've been using it every night when I'm home.  Yowzer fucking treadmill.  The best ever if you're going to get a treadmill. 
[02:51:00]  Give it two weeks.  Yeah, that'll be somewhere else.  This one, but this one's got a thing for your coffee.  This one has a thing for you if you drink coffee while you work out.  You can put your coffee in there.  It has a fan.  Yowzer fitness, you fucking...  Yowzer kid.  I bought the...  Yeah, there it is right there.  The fucking best.  I bought the Janice Dickinson Fitness Revolution, Body Revolution DVD set.  No, you didn't.  And I used it for six days and then throw it in a box.  I bought stupid weights that I'm lugging around every time I travel. 
[02:51:30]  And I'm like, I don't even use it.  See, another part of the recent timeline, the modern timeline, is the trainer.  See, because I wouldn't go to a fucking gym.  I wouldn't step on the treadmill.  I wouldn't do anything unless someone came over and threatened to beat me up unless I started fucking working out.  But that's the only way I'd do it.  Well, if I had an extra room in my house, I had to get the fucking folding treadmill because I live in a fucking midtown Manhattan.  You choose to live in New York City, my friend. 
[02:52:00]  I can't live where you live.  That $4.95 is the fucking worst.  I'm lucky because the times I drive in and out of here, it's not as bad.  The fact that they don't have a better way to get out to where you live sucks.  Take the choo-choo?  Fuck the choo-choo.  Take the choo-choo in every day.  Is that what you tell them when they're coming in?  Take the choo-choo.  We're coming from Canada.  You're an asshole.  You put your money, Pops.  Oh, Jesus, dude.  When this show...  You give them snack packs on their way back?  Here's a little apple juice. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, my God.  And a sippy.  When you finally retire from radio.  Yeah.  Nice one.  What the fuck was that?  What was that?  Round one?  What was that?  I don't know.  Roland.  Roland did something.  What the fuck was that?  I know.  What the fuck was that?  How do you not know what that was?  It sounded like something falling on the base of a mic stand.  That was weird, man.  Like a heavy...  All right.  Yeah, but we don't have any of those mic stands.  Oh, wow.  Really?  You don't know what that was?  No.  It sounded like an anvil fell.  It sounded like metal snapping.  Like, honestly, it sounded like metal snapping. 
[02:53:00]  Maybe it was my chair.  Dude, when you finally stopped doing radio...  Yeah.  That's a great fat joke on me.  That...  Your house...  It's going to be like the house at the beginning and end of Citizen Kane.  Oh, right?  It's like...  I remember the parties they used to have out here?  Ah, yes.  Cobwebs.  It's going to...  What's that castle on Game of Thrones that the dragons burned down?  This place used to be the biggest castle of them all.  Impenetrable. 
[02:53:30]  Women used to come here and bathe naked with the king.  Yeah.  The people that get your house after you, the ghosts, just the fucking dirty ghosts that  are going to be...  The house will be upset that it's not having as much fun as it did.  It's the funnest place ever to hang out ever.  It's literally every fucking dream I ever had as a child when I thought, like, when  I grow up, I'm going to have this. 
[02:54:00]  That's exactly what I thought.  Video games, karaoke, a radio station, a movie theater, a hot tub, a pool, a bar, yeah.  He has a TV studio.  Yeah.  There's a fucking studio.  That's it.  That's exactly what I wanted.  It is the funnest place to hang out.  Yeah.  If you're radio control...  I haven't taken those out in a long time.  Those would be...  That was when I was in that phase where I didn't have the show to do.  It was when we were fired for a while.  Gadgets.  And I was just buying up, like, what do I want to do? 
[02:54:30]  You know what?  Radio control helicopters sound fun.  You just went to Gizmodo every day and bought everything.  Just buy everything.  Some stuff flying those things around.  Invisibility cloak, maybe.  What do they got?  That work?  I don't know.  I don't care.  I'll buy it.  Yeah, it's just a sheet with mirrors attached to it.  There is nothing better, I mean, aside from the times at night when I cried myself to  sleep, than being single.  And, like, a grown man and single.  But even, like, in your situation, you're married, but you're still... 
[02:55:00]  Dawn is very accommodating where you can have a single type of lifestyle.  I came home last night.  I was just...  I was going to be home early.  I came home last night late, and I didn't...  What were you doing?  I was just out.  Everybody was there.  It was like the fucking old days.  And she was like, oh, cool.  I get no shit whatsoever, ever.  Yeah.  No shit whatsoever.  There's something to be said for getting no shit, man.  At all.  Ever.  Ever.  It's fucking...  It's the great...  When you can spend your money on what you want.  I was sitting at my mom's house the other day. 
[02:55:30]  I was just sitting there, and I started thinking...  Remember GameCube?  Yeah.  It was like Nintendo's thing before the Wii.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  GameCube...  I had that system when it was new, and it had these killer Star Wars games.  And I was sitting at my mom's house, and I was just thinking about it.  And I was like, those games are fucking...  I want...  I want that.  And I was just like, I'm going to go buy a GameCube right now, because I feel like it,  and buy every Star Wars game they had.  And I was like...  I started thinking about when I was 12, and I was like, I never thought I would have had  the power to do this one day, where I can just buy myself toys and gadgets. 
[02:56:00]  But that's dangerous.  That's why I'm fat, because I can literally go, well, I want to go to every pizza place  on 9th Ave, and taste test.  I guess you can.  And I can do it.  That's different, though, I think.  Well, I didn't say I wanted to buy every video game system.  Because...  Yeah, that's true.  He didn't.  Here's the deal, though.  Now, when I'm in the hotel...  When I used to do comedy at the beginning, I couldn't afford room service.  I had to go and get Oodles of Noodles or something, or eat at the club.  Now, when I go into the hotel, I'll get whatever the fuck I want on the menu. 
[02:56:30]  I'm not looking...  I don't look at the prices anymore next to...  Next...  When you go to...  I remember going to a restaurant and looking at the prices first, before I went in.  Really?  I don't even look.  I know...  What's the most?  50 bucks for a steak?  Maybe 60?  Giz a fuck.  See?  Look at that.  He is a big shot.  But no, but that's why I'm a fat fuck, too.  Is that it's like, you know, it's like I can...  I was white trash my whole life.  Couldn't afford shit. 
[02:57:00]  Ever.  Ever.  And now that I have money...  I mean, I don't have enough money to buy everybody in this room a steak, like you.  Oh, well.  But I do have the money to get my wife and myself or myself anything I want.  That's why you're fat.  Sorry.  What's the matter, Joe?  I ripped one.  Oh, it's bad.  And it was bad.  It was almost an accident.  It'll hit Danny first.  If you shit your pants, that would make me so happy.  If you just shit your pants.  And I'd show you and be happy if you vomited.  That would make me...  I'd vomit on your shit. 
[02:57:30]  Dude.  It's bad.  Of course, you gotta be careful with everything.  But I mean, I just like...  When I...  See, my thing growing up, I was such a...  I still am.  I was such a music fan.  I spent every dime of my allowance or whatever bullshit job I had on CDs.  That's all I ever bought when I was...  And I remember having to wait and not be able to buy the music I wanted to buy.  And like, it was always like a special thing every two months when I could go buy one or  two CDs or whatever.  You know, I was a kid.  I had no fucking money. 
[02:58:00]  And that lasted through college where everything was like, oh, I guess I'll go sell these CDs  so I can buy this new one that I want or whatever.  And now, like, it's such a simple pleasure.  But to be able to walk into a store and go, I'm gonna buy whatever fucking DVDs and CDs  and video games I want.  And go have fun.  Like, I just love being able to not have somebody to answer to.  I don't gotta worry about a kid.  I don't have somebody's wife there going, you know.  Isn't that great?  It really is.  I'm married, dude.  I can't.  I really...  I don't get... 
[02:58:30]  I think...  I asked you, people who got divorced, and you knew from the get-go that you shouldn't  have done it.  Oh, yes.  Everybody who's gotten divorced, I've asked...  Like, I shouldn't have gotten married to this broad.  Yeah.  Like, I'm fucking happy.  My chick's the shit.  I don't have any...  I don't...  It's actually the best thing I've done is get married for me.  You know what I mean?  There's some guys that it's that is...  I did that shit from 10 to, you know, 30-something. 
[02:59:00]  But do you look at it like it was good for me, like, because I'd be on this self-destructive  road if I didn't get married?  Because that doesn't sound very romantic.  That sounds therapeutic.  No, it's...  That has something to do with it, but I'm happy.  Like, I love hanging out with my broad.  Yeah, because...  With my broad.  Because here's the thing, is that you...  I've been with so many chicks that...  Oh, do tell.  But you...  How many girls can you hang out with for more than a few hours before you're like, 
[02:59:30]  get the fuck away from me?  Please stop talking.  It's a handful.  Yeah.  I mean, when you had your chick, it was...  You know, it's like...  It's at the beginning.  It's like fucking...  Oh, I could finally be with this chick and just hang with her all day.  And not worry...  She doesn't bug me.  I don't want her to fucking stab her on the neck with a pencil every time she breathes.  Shut the fuck up.  Yeah, me and my...  I mean, they did a...  I told you, they did a thing on love.  There is no love.  It's compatibility.  People who are married for 50 years, they're just compatible people. 
[03:00:00]  They can be around each other all the time.  Me and my chick are really compatible.  And so that...  I mean, I love her too.  I've been friends with her for over 15 years.  So you put all that shit together and there's a relationship.  And I'm happy in it.  I'm fucking happy.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm happy.  I mean, sure, I'm going to go to your house Saturday night and fucking avoid blowjobs.  Blowjob Alley.  I'm going to have to have face...  I'm going to have to FaceTime on the whole time with my wife. 
[03:00:30]  Help me.  Blowjob Alley.  It's like a jackass stunt.  You're going to try to get through the room without getting your cocks on.  Getting your cocks on with a fucking...  A chick with fucking nice fucking titties.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, dude.  I wish I could...  I wish I could meet like the one chick that I could...  I wish I was gay, dude.  I really wish I was gay.  I wish you were too, dude.  Look, I hang out with my friends.  If I could hang out with a chick the way I hang out with you guys...  Yeah, but if you were gay, it would be the same thing, only you'd feel like me about guys. 
[03:01:00]  You'd be like, oh, I can't hang out with this guy for more than 10 minutes.  See, I don't think that's...  Seriously, it's the truth.  That was a good gay guy voice.  Oh, thanks.  No, but I don't think...  Here's where I don't agree with that.  It's the difference between the sexes...  First of all, you are gay.  Let's just get that.  Let's throw that on the table.  You're as close to being a fucking homo as homos are.  You think so?  Dude, what kind of shirt is that? 
[03:01:30]  It's a Henley.  Oh, boy.  It's a Henley.  He knows...  He taught me what a heathered t-shirt...  I didn't know what a heathered t-shirt's are.  Do you?  No.  Yeah, but that's just because I like clothes.  Oh, man.  If that doesn't say...  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  That's definitely a...  Fag, fag, fag, fag, fag.  That's definitely a, yeah, yeah.  I like clothes.  I like a good cry.  I'm not fucking embarrassed to admit it.  You live your life through your TV shows.  Will and Grace. 
[03:02:00]  Like on Will and Grace when she came in and she caught him.  Oh, boy.  Sex and the City, one of my favorite shows of all time.  Oh, right.  Yeah, so look, I got my little things that I do.  So you're saying it's more the guys and the girls, the way the girls are.  Well, dude, it's what Bobby just said.  It's compatibility.  It's like, dude, I can hang out.  Look, after you blow a fucking load, do you want to hang out abroad?  No.  You want to go meet your boys at the bar and fucking laugh it up and have drinks and smoke 
[03:02:30]  a couple of butts and talk about the banging you just did.  Butts.  Smoke a couple of cocks.  I mean, cigarettes.  And talk about the banging you just did.  So it's like, to me, theoretically, if I wanted to bang guys, I'd bang a guy and then be like,  ah, you're a good dude.  Let's go hang now.  If you're thinking like a heterosexual male in that world, I don't think it would work  that way.  I think it would be, the dynamic's different.  All of a sudden, it's the same thing as if it was a chick.  Yeah, you bang a guy, that guy's going to go, where are you going? 
[03:03:00]  Right.  What are you doing?  Start giving you shit.  And you're going to go, let's go to the bar.  I'm tired.  I want to work tomorrow.  Come on, cuddle.  Just come here.  Why don't you just cuddle with me?  Come here.  Let me see your shoulders.  Don't you think there's a higher chance?  There would be a higher chance of me meeting my exact whatever, if it was a dude, then  it was a chick.  So a man's guy, you're like, hey, that was a good blowjob.  Thanks, Joe.  Let's go watch the game.  I'd be the one going, where are you going? 
[03:03:30]  First of all, Joe's the bitch.  Joe's the bottom.  Yeah, he doesn't know what sports are.  I'd be a sweet bottom.  First of all, you'd go to...  I already have a bottom with chicks.  I just lay there.  I'm not fucking doing all the ramming.  Get on top.  Joe's a bottom.  He's a little sloppy bottom.  Yeah, I'm a fucking sloppy bottom.  If you were gay, you're talking about straight eights.  You're talking about being a straight eight.  Like, I get to be a guy, hang out with guys, and then I'm just going to blow my load with 
[03:04:00]  another guy.  So it's just about blowing the load.  Yeah.  Yeah, but gay guys don't do...  They're women, too.  It's the same fucking relationship.  You're going to go through the same bullshit that you go through with a bra you're going  to go through with a woman.  They're going to play the same fucking head games.  You're going to feel the same insecurities.  I don't know, man.  I'm telling you, don't go gay.  I think so.  Full gay, Joe.  I can't go gay.  I don't want to suck dick.  Not...  Oh, wow.  It's not Bailey, Jay. 
[03:04:30]  Can we get Bailey to your house?  Can we just...  Bailey would be cordially invited over to my house.  Really?  Yeah, sure.  Awesome.  I'm no homophobe.  She's the best.  Yeah, she's the greatest.  And her husband's a shit, too.  Take that fucking...  Matt Tehune.  They might come out to one of my shows.  Here we go.  Tonight, Thursday, or Sunday.  Here we go.  Dude, funny you say that, because they're on riotcast.com, the Bailey J show now, with Dr.  Steve Weird Medicine just got picked up.  Yes, Weird Medicine did.  Fucking dude, he was 24 on the chart yesterday. 
[03:05:00]  He goes right to the top, cocksucker.  Dr. Steve's great.  Unbelievable.  So, now, this Bailey J thing's got me with you.  You definitely would do stuff.  Have we not discussed this enough?  Yeah, I know.  Would you let...  I want to know that...  We really...  We really have.  I feel like we've really delved into this at length, to the point where I called her  and I was like, should I not talk about this anymore?  You're just not going to talk about me sucking your dick.  I can't watch your porn anymore, though.  I can't.  I can't watch it anymore. 
[03:05:30]  Honestly, at this point, it's like Bobby said, it's just...  It's too familiar now.  Yeah, it's like watching your sister brother.  Yeah, I lost the urge.  What about, like, coming in your mouth?  What if Bailey J wants to come in your mouth?  You're there.  You're doing it.  You get to spit it out, though.  You don't have to swallow it.  You can spit it back out like AIDS come.  Is that what it's called?  Yeah, that's what they do in the pornos now.  You ever notice when they...  They used to swallow it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:06:00]  And then they transition, when AIDS came out, to having it in their mouth and spitting  it back out.  Yeah, yeah.  Because if you don't swallow it, you can't get the fucking hibs up.  Oh, really?  Well, you can't if you've got a bleeding gut in your mouth.  Well, don't floss before you suck a dude's dick.  You've got to cut...  Your ears are the dangerous part.  It's up here.  Yeah.  That's the bloodstream.  It's hard to get AIDS.  It very is.  But it's very hard.  Let's all hope.  Yeah, right.  Would you take it?  In the bit that I do about this...  Hang on one second. 
[03:06:30]  Anthony, would you let a guy come in your mouth?  No.  Okay, see how quick that was?  Yeah.  Stuttering fucking homo.  Here's the thing.  I do a bit about this, about the stair step up to it.  It's not as easy as would you just swallow the cum.  It's like there are so many...  It's like becoming president.  There are many levels of things you need to get through first.  So by the time I have a dick in my mouth, I might be fucking all in.  I might want to go all the way.  But I might not even get to the point of being able to have a dick in my mouth. 
[03:07:00]  So the passion at that point might have overtaken you.  I think it's the roses in bed with Bailey J and things are happening.  You're so caught up in that moment.  If Bailey J want to fuck you in the ass, Bailey J's fucking you in the ass.  It's just happening.  I guarantee Joe would...  I think, first of all, Joe is a romantic at heart.  I believe that.  Yeah.  He's watched too many rom-coms with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.  Meg Ryan with a dick.  Yeah. 
[03:07:30]  I'd fucking do it.  Meg Hanks.  Yeah, Meg Hanks.  So if he was with Bailey J in bed, you'd kiss and fool around and foreplay a little bit.  Yeah.  No.  Look, listen.  If she walked in here right now, I'd make out with her in a fucking second.  I'd play with her boobs.  Her boobs.  Dude, this is...  You know the funny story about this?  Yeah.  I was with Jay Moore at a casino, and he was fucking grilling me about this.  We're all in the bathroom.  All night he was grilling me about this. 
[03:08:00]  Of course.  And we're in the bathroom.  I wonder why.  And he goes...  Can I tell you?  And he goes...  He goes, come on, dude.  You're telling me you don't know if you would suck her dick or not.  You're telling me you don't know.  And I'm going, Jay, I don't fucking know, dude.  I don't know, you know?  And he goes, what would you do with her?  What would you do?  And he's fucking hammering me so really loud.  I go, look.  I'd make out with her.  I'd play with her tits.  And right as this black dude's walking out of the stalls, I go, I'd let her bang me in the ass. 
[03:08:30]  And fucking Jay ran out of the bathroom across the canino floor.  Yeah, he had to get his far away.  He's laughing.  And I was chasing him.  I go, what are you doing?  And he's going, he's going, you just said bang me in the ass in front of the guy in the bathroom.  What does he think we're fucking doing in there, man?  But I've got to be honest with you.  I'd be more open to an ass banging.  Wow.  Than you would to sucking. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, sorry.  I'd be more open to an ass banging than a blowjob.  No, not me.  Than you would to sucking Bailey's dick.  Dude, you'd take it in the ass before you'd put it in your mouth?  From a chick, I would.  Really?  I mean, I don't know, theoretically.  And he's, like, after it's done, there's cum coming out of your ass.  Well, I'm going to wear a condom, Anthony.  Let's not get carried away here.  No, you're not.  It's not going to be safe.  Yeah, he's going to be safe.  Jeez, don't.  You are not.  Don't make him into a whore.  You are a whore.  I mean, if I don't wear a condom, that's gay. 
[03:09:30]  What is that?  I don't know.  That's Joe.  Danny pulls a fucking picture up of some guy with a beard.  Pull up Bailey J.  Can I see Bailey J?  Five o'clock show.  Joe's a sissy.  He's a sissy boy.  A sissy boy.  Yeah.  Joe's a sissy boy with a five o'clock shadow.  They're the guys that don't go all out with the makeup and the actual grooming.  That's too old of a picture because she doesn't have the full-on tits.  That's when she was a Japanese boy.  Jeez.  Japanese boy. 
[03:10:00]  That's when she was a Japanese boy.  That fucking...  Hold on.  Is that a good one?  Get a good one.  No.  She's pretty there.  That's a good one, but hang on.  She's pretty there.  She's got pre coming out to me.  That's a good one.  Dick.  Hang on.  I got a...  Get a good one.  I thought I did.  Bobby's getting all excited over there.  Here's a good one.  She's spreading her butthole open.  There you go, Joe.  There's what you want.  Oh, no.  Oh, man.  That's okay.  There you go.  What's that one?  That's a good one.  Oh, what about that?  There you go.  Now, Joe.  I can't be honest. 
[03:10:30]  The first thought that popped into my head was I wanted to kiss it.  That was honestly, God, the first thing that popped into my head.  We need...  Listen to me.  I want to kiss it.  We need to get...  And not only kiss it.  I swear to God, I'm not lying.  Crawl over on my hands and knees and kiss it.  That was the first thing that popped into my head.  Maybe I'm a fanook.  We need to get a tranny.  We need to hire a tranny to come to one of your parties.  Yeah.  A hot tranny.  A hot tranny. 
[03:11:00]  Not Billy Jay because he's friends.  A hot tranny.  And just leave her in one of the rooms for Joe.  Like, if he wants to...  So Joe can crawl over on his hands and knees and kiss it.  You're not going to find anybody as hot as her.  No, that's just it.  I know Joe.  It's got to be Bailey.  He'll have to crawl over me and Norton.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, wait a minute.  What's happening?  Pulling each other's feet out of the room.  Chips in the back of Jimmy's head.  Why does this girl have three cocks?  And two of them are mediocre.  So you're like thinking of crawling over there, giving a little kiss. 
[03:11:30]  Jesus Christ, Joe.  It's a dick.  It's a guy's dick.  Yeah, but it's a pretty one.  It's a guy's dick.  But it's a good one.  What are you talking about?  It's an effeminate dick.  What?  That's hilarious.  It's a great one.  Look at that.  I really need to send Bailey a check for all the airtime she's getting.  Yes, that is true.  She needs to send you money.  Wow.  You're not going to find anybody that looks like that.  Outside of vanity.  And even vanity.  I just put my fucking egg burrito in my mouth like a cock. 
[03:12:00]  Oh.  Well, Bailey's asshole's pretty tight, though, for, you know.  That's a pretty asshole.  Right?  I would love to make out with her and see what kind of things it might stir up.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You would so fucking be down on that.  Joe can't wait to fucking switch teams.  I know.  Joe's just waiting.  I don't want to switch.  I don't like dudes.  That's why you moved out of the neighborhood.  You want to go down to the fucking East Village.  He cannot wait to become a free agent.  His contract is up, and he cannot wait to be a free agent. 
[03:12:30]  That's why he's trying to get a new neighborhood.  He wants to be free of Bob Kelly two blocks away.  He doesn't want to bump into me with your fucking new boyfriend.  Oh, hi, Bob.  This is my apartment broker.  Oh, look at that one.  That's nice right there, right?  She's pretty.  Dude, I can't explain it.  I'm not attracted to dudes.  Nothing about me makes...  I don't want to bang a guy.  But you take that in your ass.  What are you doing, Roland?  He was sleeping. 
[03:13:00]  His hand's on his cock.  What are you doing?  Oh, man, Roland.  He's lost a lot of weight.  Eight.  Jesus.  He went to the strip club and fucking came twice in his pants.  I'm not kidding.  Who comes in a strip club?  Exactly.  I used to do that all the time.  We were in Cleveland.  We were in Cleveland.  I just see him going to the back with some fucking dancer.  And then he comes back.  He goes back with another dancer later on.  And then we find out he came twice in his pants.  Dude, we were in a strip club once in Philly. 
[03:13:30]  We went during the day.  We went at like 12 o'clock.  No better feeling.  Yeah.  Day strip club.  We got fucking ripped up.  The strippers were all sitting with us.  The place is empty.  They all love us.  They're not even hitting us for dances.  We're just having a great time, me and my buddy.  He's like, I'm going to go back and get a lap dance.  I'm like, okay.  So he goes back with this chick.  It's like 3 o'clock now.  He comes storming out of the fucking lap dance room.  He goes, dude, we have to go right now. 
[03:14:00]  We have to go now.  And I go, why?  What the fuck did you do?  What happened?  And I look down and he has got a fucking wet cum stain that fucking big on his shorts.  The girl yelled at him for coming in his pants.  The bouncer yelled at him.  And they were like, get the fuck out of there.  We had to.  How does the girl yell?  It's like, fuck you, man.  She goes, you're supposed to tell us before that happens so we can get ready for it.  Because they were naked.  Ready, schmetty. 
[03:14:30]  Schmetty.  Ready, schmetty.  My favorite thing to do.  She wasn't committed to her work.  Ready, schmetty.  I'd rather fucking.  She wasn't committed.  Because if you said that, then it mixes you all up.  Strip clubs are fucking bogus to me.  Joe's got a tummy ache.  Strip clubs are so bogus.  Yeah.  How would you go to a strip club when you can actually go and have somebody jerk you off  or suck your dick?  Done with fucking strip clubs.  Yeah.  Why are you going to do that?  I don't.  I don't.  I don't go anywhere.  They're just.  They're fun to go to with friends if they're like Rex.  You go to the local, like Long Island strip clubs? 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  In the daytime, you sit down, you're just drinking beers and fucking going, look at this pig.  Yeah.  If you're fucking around.  That's fine.  Yeah.  You go to the.  I like the daytime too because they have the veterans on.  Like she's around 42.  Oh, yeah.  She comes out with a cave woman uniform.  Disasters.  Like she has an outfit with like a plastic club.  Yeah.  She does like a little thing.  And nothing beats leaving a strip club when it's still bright afternoon out.  You make that thing like you just came out of a cave.  You're like, ah, you can't.  Your eyes are adjusting. 
[03:15:30]  I don't mind.  I don't mind if it shits and giggles, but I hate going to strip clubs to get off.  No, no.  It fucking blows.  That's ridiculous.  So I'd save my hundred bucks.  Go to Backpage and get somebody to come over and do a nice sliding session.  Yeah.  Sorry.  I was looking at Bailey.  I agree.  Oh, she's hot.  I got Bailey movie going here.  I wrote a joke.  I don't want you to think I stole it just now.  I wrote a joke about what you just said.  What?  Sliding?  No, about the old, the fucking A-team of strippers when you go at like 11 a.m.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[03:16:00]  It's like strippers are like the opposite of athletes.  Like you don't send your fucking A-team in first.  That's in the book.  Is that in the book?  Yeah, I wrote it in the book.  You did steal it.  You fucking read my shit in the book.  I guess that's where I got it from.  Yeah, there you go, Joe.  I won't do it anymore.  By the way, we have a book coming out.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Let me get you a copy.  Hey, I know.  We gotta give you a copy.  I got a little story in there.  You got a great story in there.  That's a fun one.  Yeah.  Fucking great story.  That's one of them that's over the house right now is the one from the closet. 
[03:16:30]  No.  Yeah.  Wow.  She is a fine piece of work.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know what she looks like.  I want to see her.  Oh.  I imagine in my head what she looks like hiding in a closet.  Oh, wait a minute.  Let me think again.  So, yeah.  Talk about the book you got coming out.  The book is coming out.  The book is coming out as we watch Bailey J. jerk off.  I know.  We're all jerking off.  Yeah.  It's called Cheat.  Yeah, it's coming out October. 
[03:17:00]  Beginning of October.  Yeah, I think in the first week or something.  And all you cocksuckers who've been trying to see the movie, if you buy the book, you'll  be able to see the movie.  Yes.  We're working it out, so it's going to be available.  It's me, Bill, Joe.  Oh, man.  He's got a giant heart on now.  And there's great people.  We wrote the book, but then a lot of people contributed some content.  Yes.  Opie.  About, yeah, Opie, Anthony, Voss.  Yeah, Jim couldn't because he's writing a book, another book himself, so. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, a lot of common, you know, a lot of great people contributed some stuff, some really  funny stuff to the book.  And it's funny, man.  And we actually, we had to send it out to get quotes.  Yeah, these blurbs.  You know, the thing on the back of the book that says, you know, riveting, you know, hilarious,  you know, those things.  Riveting, hilarious.  It says so-and-so.  And some of the people we sent it to were like, I can't, I can't give you a quote. 
[03:18:00]  Wow, why?  Yeah.  Because it's too funny.  We did not hold, we wrote this book funny, but it's, we didn't hold back.  It's really how to cheat and get away with it.  Like, we tried to really, like, we tried to really, yeah, but when, you know, you're on  a fucking network show, you really can't get behind this book.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, because we really, we call, you know, we call women for what they are on the, we  say, we're like, just imagine if Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin wrote this book back in the 
[03:18:30]  day, that's the tone it has.  I'm now watching Bailey shove a big dildo in her, his ass.  Look at that ass.  Oh, man.  We also, uh.  Tight little butt.  If you saw that, just take the seam of her balls and make that a vagina lift.  And right there, look at that.  If you saw that and that was just a big puffy pussy, would you be good with that?  Fucking great with it.  Anthony, not you, you homo.  Oh, wow.  You mean if the ball bag was a pussy?  Yeah, look at it.  Oh, yeah.  One second, look.  Yeah, that's a pretty big fucking step, though. 
[03:19:00]  Eh, not for me.  She's spinning it like a doorknob in there.  If she shoots that out like a fucking rocket.  See, though, look at the taint.  It's, that's all, that's a fucking, that's a ball bag.  That's not a ball bag.  Is there moaning?  That's a pocketbook of fun.  Does she moan like a girl?  Sweet god damn it.  I was not going to pick up.  That's not me.  That's not, that's Norton.  What is it?  I guess.  What are you doing?  Oh, fucking Sam.  Um, Sam only cares about his show. 
[03:19:30]  I know.  It's a computer.  You only care about your show, dude.  You would never fuck up.  Real nice.  Real good job, Sam.  Penis calisthenics.  That's fucked up, man.  The, uh.  Hang on.  Is that it?  Oh, there we go.  Oh.  Oh, that's good.  That's not it.  That's the one, she sounds like a girl.  Um.  Um.  Wow.  It's the best gayest thing I've ever done. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, flapper, flapper.  Flapper, flapper.  Flapper, flapper.  That's what I call that.  She's flapper, flapping her cock.  Yeah, when they whap it back and forth.  It's like a little silky terrier dog tail.  Flapper, flapper, flapper.  She's happy.  What's the matter, Joe?  I love her.  You're getting fucking.  I love her.  Take back what I said that I was over it.  I'm not over it.  Joe's in love, man.  I'm not over it.  But her husband's the nicest guy ever.  He's the greatest.  Oh, he's awesome.  About the husband who cares.  Typical Anthony.  Who gives a shit?  Fuck him. 
[03:20:30]  Fuck him.  Jesus.  Who gives a shit?  Get in there and suck that dick, Joe.  Fuck him.  Suck his dick to get to that dick.  Now, there's the question.  What if you could get to Bailey J, but through a husband?  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  Like, did I have to, like, hook up with her husband first?  He'd have to be there.  Watching or participating?  Well, both.  Oh, boy.  Not participating.  Oh, shit.  Look at that big load.  But if he was like, I gotta be there.  Right into Joe's mouth.  That big load would have just gone right in your mouth. 
[03:21:00]  Pull that back.  Show Joe what that load would have been like.  I backed it up.  Oh, here we go.  Joe can experience the whole thing.  Joe, here it is.  Here it is.  Right here, Joe.  This is what you'd be doing.  Ready?  Yeah, you'd be licking the ball, sucking the taint.  She'd be jerking off, flapping it.  Joe's licking the screen.  I'd love it.  Oh, here we go, Joe.  Here it is, Joe.  Watch.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Get it, Joe.  Hang on.  Get it, Joe.  Feed to me.  Ready?  Here it comes, Joe.  Ready, Joe?  Here it comes.  Bailey's going to fucking...  Oh, yeah.  Bailey's ready to shoot.  Come on, already. 
[03:21:30]  This is uncomfortable.  Hang on.  Keep going.  Here it comes.  Oh, yeah.  She's not...  Oh, yeah.  Bailey's ready.  I think it came out.  No?  No, no.  It didn't.  There it comes.  Right here.  Oh, here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Wait a minute.  Come on.  Come on, Bailey.  What are you waiting for?  Oh, here it goes.  Here it goes.  Oh, God.  Oh, man. 
[03:22:00]  There it is.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Oh, look how adorable she comes.  Oh, wow.  And then she takes her...  Oh, you were still taping me.  Anthony.  Then she takes his Henley shirt and then wipes her dick with his Henley shirt.  His Henley shirt.  I didn't want to take it because I don't want that on the internet.  No, I was just standing there doing that.  I took a photo.  I thought you were video-taming.  That's why I was doing that.  Even I don't want to put that out there on the internet, Joe. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, man.  Because you're going to get a gig someday for some channel, and that's going to pop up.  Yeah, that's true.  I don't need that.  I don't want your kids and your wife someday, because you're going to get married someday.  You're going to be over this homo phase.  That's quite the cummy dick right there.  My wife will go, you never suck my dick like that.  Oh, man.  Now she's licking up the cum from the...  What's the matter, Bobby?  Look, look.  Look at Bailey lick it up. 
[03:23:00]  Why would you...  What kind of camera is...  That's not cute when she licks the cum off the camera lens?  You're not supposed to eat your own cum.  That's like eating your own kids.  Anthony admitted to going down on a chick after he jizzed her pussy before.  But I wasn't burying my tongue inside.  I would, like, flick and lick the clit.  But you were trying to suck your cum back out.  So gross.  You know what?  No, I wasn't, Bobby.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I said.  You weren't.  Oh, thank you.  I was on your side.  You know what?  You were trying to... 
[03:23:30]  No.  That's what I heard.  I don't like the way...  I said you weren't.  Why did I hear that?  I like the way pussy tastes after dick's been in it.  That's it.  Right there.  Stop.  Yeah?  That's it.  I don't like the way pussy tastes.  And I don't like the way dick tastes after it's been in pussy.  You know what?  Bailey likes the ass-to-mouth thing, too.  God.  Well, she pretty much has to.  No, you don't have to.  What else is there with there?  No, you don't...  Jesus Christ.  There's an asshole in a mouth. 
[03:24:00]  Well, no.  Like, fuck in the ass and then put it in the mouth.  Yeah.  She likes that.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  What's going on there?  I don't know.  Look at that.  Look at that fucking piece.  Joe is in love with Bailey's dick.  I tell you why.  Because she's got a nice cock.  What?  I mean, trannies...  They have fucked up dicks, a lot of them.  It looks like it'd be nice.  They got fucking uncircumcised.  They had gray, brown, and black.  It looks like it'd be nice.  It's a nice...  It's a little nice...  You know, and the ball sack is nice and clean. 
[03:24:30]  There's no dirty, you know, guy, dark skin between the ball and the leg.  Because she plays soccer most of her childhood in Brazil.  She would give you the best hand job ever.  You think?  She would give you the best fucking hand job ever.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Anyways.  Well...  I got my wife pregnant last night, I think.  What?  You know, I just think I did.  I think I...  Wow, that's a bold statement right there.  It was such a good session.  Oh, really? 
[03:25:00]  It was such a good...  Like, I was really...  I haven't watched porn in two weeks.  I really held everything back.  Oh.  And it was like one of those days, and I just fucking...  I just had a great session.  Did you go deep?  Well, I can't...  Did you let loose deep?  I can't go deep.  I go...  Well, as deep as you can go.  I go fucking halfway.  I don't hit anything.  Was she ovulating?  She's ovulating today, tomorrow.  You know, you can't really...  That...  I mean...  Wow.  You gotta go...  There's so many fucking things that people tell you... 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  ...to do when you want to get a fucking broad pregnant.  You gotta...  The day before, today she's supposed to be ovulating, and then tomorrow...  So you...  Some people say do it one day, skip a day.  I'm fucking all this week.  You gotta, right?  Yeah, you gotta fuck all this week.  So you really want a kid, huh?  I do, man.  I want a fucking kid.  Yep.  I know.  I want a fucking kid.  Bobby Kelly as a dad.  He'll be a great dad.  I'll be a great dad.  Yeah, I'll be a great dad.  He'll be a great dad. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Why do you say that?  Because I don't know.  I'm a fucking kid, dude.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm a 40-year fucking...  Does that make a good dad?  Yeah, because I've been through so much shit.  Now, look, I don't know how I'd be as a...  If I have a son, because I...  I don't know.  I get scared with that, because I have that...  You know, my stepdad was such a fucking lunatic.  But if I have a daughter, yeah, I'd be...  I want a daughter.  I'd be fucking great.  Yeah.  Yeah, plus you can throw all the bad shit over to the mother, you know?  Well, that's true.  You can't really throw the boy over to the mom at any point. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, you gotta take, you know, fuck, you know, that's gonna be a hard one when he starts  doing shit that I did, or...  You know what Louie was saying yesterday about, uh, he goes, you know, because he's a single  dating guy, and he was talking about ages of girls that you'd go out with, and he goes  to some of the younger girls that he's been out with, he starts getting this, like, kind  of father thing where he looks at, like, their skin is all nice and smooth, and he starts  equating it almost to his daughter's look, and it fucks him up, like it fucks it up, 
[03:27:00]  where he wants to tell her, hey, don't fuck me, look, get your life in order, and do this.  That's fucked up, though.  Yeah, there's nothing worse than when you can relate somebody you're gonna have sex with  to somebody you're related to, and you're like, oh, man.  You don't want that.  Yeah, like, I have a niece that's 20, 22.  Yeah?  Like, I couldn't...  What?  I couldn't imagine, like, having a sex with a 22-year-old, because when you...  Some girls in my family are 21, 22, and then you... 
[03:27:30]  And they're little kids to me, because they're my...  Yeah, my niece and the people and my cousins...  You know what 21, 22-year-olds are doing these days, Bobby?  I know, dude.  They're fucking everything.  Dude, I was...  I know, I did.  And without even fucking...  I used to have to bargain for a blowjob when I was growing up, like a fucking...  Like, it was gold doubloons.  And now it's like a prerequisite.  What is gold doubloons?  Gold doubloons.  It's what the pirates used to have.  The pirates used to have.  Are gold doubloons.  They're like currency.  You can get a necklace.  Yeah.  Get it off the discoverychannel.com. 
[03:28:00]  It's like their currency, you know.  All right.  It's like what they put in their treasure chest.  Yeah, remember when Johnny Depp, the fucking thing...  The gold.  The coins, the bucket, the first one.  Not for the doubloons.  The doubloons.  Look, but now, the blowjobs just...  It's like what they do.  Then it was like, try to fucking get a blowjob.  Try.  Good fucking luck.  Dice, are they sucking dick now?  Hey, these hoos, these days, they love the cock in their fucking mouths.  But it's good, because then they can't fucking talk. 
[03:28:30]  Right, honey?  Oh, I want to tell you about my day.  Yeah, you can put this in your face.  You hoo-hoo.  Good, you good.  Dice, what about having babies?  You think I should have a baby?  No, no.  You put it in her ass.  You don't have babies that way.  Just pump a load into a shitter.  What about fucking young girls?  Fuck anything.  Dice, gotta love Dice.
