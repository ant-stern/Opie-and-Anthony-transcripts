<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts mocking their own show's quality and engaging in cynical commentary about the impending East Coast winter storm, speculating on the manipulative aspects of weather reporting designed to boost viewership.  A new listener-participation segment was introduced, urging listeners to tweet “yay pudding” (with a description in parentheses) each time they farted.  The conversation then took a dark turn, focusing graphically on the SeaWorld killer whale Tilikum ("Shamu") and its history of killing three people, including details of one incident allegedly involving sexual activity with the whale.  The hosts' discussion was peppered with provocative language and numerous tangents.  They briefly touched upon the Winter Olympics, offering commentary on the men's and women's hockey games, including remarks on the female players' appearance. The hosts also discussed their strained relationship with Kevin Smith, speculating on the reasons for his absence from the show, possibly related to studio-mandated publicity for his new movie.  A short audio clip of John Montone, the originator of the term “snorricane,” was played.  Several callers contributed their thoughts on the whale incident, the storm, and other unrelated topics, often employing crude humor.  Studio guest Abdul, the coffee man, made brief interjections throughout this segment.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of Jerry Seinfeld's new book, with speculation about its content, particularly focusing on his personal life and past relationships.  The hosts engaged in humorous, albeit crude, speculation about the size of Seinfeld's penis.  The majority of this segment, however, centered on a "We Are the World" parody recording featuring the show's staff and guests.  The hosts played several unmixed audio tracks showcasing the raw recordings of various contributors, including Kenny, Mustard, and Grey Wolf.  Their commentary focused on the differing quality of the performances, Mustard's struggles with sobriety, and the difficulties in working with Grey Wolf, who insisted on playing the flute.  A listener, Dash from Syracuse, provided an audio clip of a local Syracuse news report announcing Chris Benoit's son's birthday, which caused discomfort amongst the hosts.  The segment concluded with the continued playback of the unmixed "We Are the World" parody tracks.  No studio guests were present during this portion of the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I have a raging heart on it.  Let me tell you something about this radio show you listen to.  We are really good.  Yeah, man, we hang out, we gonna be all wet.  Yeah, man. 
[00:00:30]  We know when we suck.  We know when we're great.  But we do like when you say how great we are.  Holy shit!  Oh, my good golly!  Hey, look, we're broadcasting again.  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  Yeah!  Enough of this palaver!  Hi, everybody.  Well, another winter storm for the East Coast, right?  Oh, this one's gonna be the worst one ever. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, batting down the hatches.  Yeah.  If you're listening to us in Arizona, bear with us for a minute.  We got another winter storm.  Yeah, the East Coast.  Oh, just kidding.  Pummeled.  Well, I think we're gonna get rain.  You think it's gonna be mostly a rain event?  Yeah, make it rain.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, look, north and west and south of the area.  They always do that.  Snow for our area?  There's gonna be a lot of it.  And then our area is also west and north, which is, you know, in the woods. 
[00:01:30]  But that's what they say.  As far as the city goes and...  I like to ski.  Yeah.  And I will drive two hours north of here, two and a half hours north, and it's the same  newscast.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  And that's our area.  You're listening to the local news when you drive up there and go skiing?  Mm-hmm.  It's the same thing.  And then they go, well, the city in Long Island, probably don't worry about it.  It's a rain event.  But it's funny.  They go, for our area, two feet. 
[00:02:00]  So Long Island, for example, might get to four inches.  And just west of Manhattan could get two feet.  Two feet.  But then they say...  But that two feet is for our area.  So now you're a dummy out there in Long Island thinking, oh, my God, I'm gonna have two feet  of snow to deal with.  And they want you to think that.  Because that's the way they word it.  Because they want as many people as possible to keep, you know, tuning in for the latest  forecast.  Yep.  That's how they...  It's all trickery, my friends.  That's how they word it.  They say, yeah, two feet of snow in our area, we'll tell you where. 
[00:02:30]  And you're like, what?  But is that me?  Got a lot of yay puddings this morning already.  Oh, boy.  A lot of yay puddings.  Jesus.  I saw a lot of them being tweeted.  Yeah, but, I mean, we're starting this, our first Twitter bit officially.  Wow.  And when you fart, you just type yay pudding, and we're going with Y-A-Y.  Yes, it's easier that way.  But I don't want people just saying yay pudding. 
[00:03:00]  I mean, really, just do it when you actually fart.  And the new thing that's happening in parentheses, they're quickly describing it.  Like yesterday, I went yay pudding, outboard motor, in parentheses.  Oh, so it gives you a little description of what happened.  Someone wrote yay pudding, parentheses, SBD.  Silent but deadly.  Exactly.  So they're describing them very quickly in parentheses just to make it a little more fun.  But don't just type yay pudding if you're not farting. 
[00:03:30]  It's for the farters out there.  Yeah, stop it, you poser.  Wannabe.  Yeah.  So we got this dumb weather thing, whatever, we'll get through it.  We should have 50 mile an hour winds later today.  Well, they're calling it a snow, I can't even say the word.  It's a snorricane.  A snorricane.  That's what John Montone was calling it.  Our friend John Montone.  John Montone.  I'm here in Midtown with Abdul, the coffee man.  Abdul, what do you think of the storm? 
[00:04:00]  I think it's going to be rain.  Going to be rain.  Where did you get your meteorology degree?  I am a New Yorker.  I know this rain.  Kill infidel.  Wait, I mean rain.  Who made you a weatherman?  That's what he said.  Yeah.  He goes, well, it's apparently going to be a snow hurricane.  What would you call that?  A mixed bag.  He said mixed bag.  You didn't get the bed, didn't get the set up. 
[00:04:30]  And then he goes, well, some people are calling it a snorricane.  I'm John Montone.  But no one's calling it a snorricane, John.  John Montone is.  John's hoping that the whole world goes with this snorricane word.  Stupid John Montone.  No, he's a fun guy.  I listen to him every morning.  I mean stupid in an endearing way.  Yes.  That was just pleasantries.  Pleasantries. 
[00:05:00]  That was a really nice example of pleasantries.  Pleasantries.  Stupid John Montone.  Snorricane.  What does that mean?  It means a snow event with huge winds, which I thought was just called a blizzard.  Right.  You know, when you get snow and a lot of wind, it's called a blizzard, but they're saying,  you know, gale force winds.  I'm kind of liking we're having a real winter.  Are you sick of it?  Who's sick of it?  Who's sick of it?  You sick of it, Jimmy?  Just because it's affecting travel.  I was supposed to leave today at 2.15. 
[00:05:30]  And the next earliest flight was 9.45 because it's a fucking, we were afraid the flight's  going to get snowed in.  It's crazy.  Wait a minute.  I'm doing some calculating.  Does that mean you have to leave early today?  It does.  But I don't want to.  But we're going to miss you.  I actually really am annoyed that we have to, but, you know, it's fucking snow.  Yeah.  You don't even have to be here.  Jimmy's such a trooper.  I know.  He doesn't even have to be here, but he says, you know, I'll come in for an hour, hour and  a half, and then I got to get an early flight to Cleveland.  I don't look at this like I used to look at jobs. 
[00:06:00]  I don't look at a day off.  I honestly don't.  There's a day off.  It's like, I'm getting out of it.  I really despise leaving early.  Less to get blown, which this is not.  To go to Cleveland.  Could be.  What are you doing later?  Okay.  Give it a few more years, and you'll understand, and you'll treat this like a job.  Killer Whale.  I mean, should we get right into this?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  This Killer Whale down in SeaWorld.  Yep.  SeaWorld.  Disney, right?  Down there in Florida.  Well, it's a different organization, but, you know. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  You're right.  SeaWorld.  Yeah, you're right.  SeaWorld's its own entity.  I just figured Disney owned everything by now, but, right, SeaWorld is its own entity.  Now, apparently, there's a big ruse going on down there, because they seem to call all  of their Killer Whales.  They have names, but when they're out there performing, they're all Shamu.  Really?  Yes.  And, ladies and gentlemen, here comes Shamu.  Shamu, and it's like, no, that's just another Killer Whale. 
[00:07:00]  Like, they have other, they have a few of them.  I always thought I was seeing the big star of the show.  Shamu's dead.  Shamu's just like the, uh.  It's like, uh, you know, the generic name.  Is it like Dave Thomas?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, no, but they're.  No, it's like Ronald McDonald.  Ronald McDonald is a better example.  So, you know, how many different people have played Ronald McDonald over the years?  Gotcha.  And it's not Ronald McDonald, unless Ronald McDonald grabbed you and dragged you under,  uh, and, uh, drown you.  That's.  But then, uh, this one is, uh, Tilikum, which you may remember the name. 
[00:07:30]  Well, well, you know what?  What are you doing?  Nah.  This is dramatic, what we're about to tell everybody.  Oh, yes.  And you just jump right into it.  Oh, I know.  I mean, this is very.  No.  No?  Not, not the mainstream media.  Well, that's true.  The listeners do, yes.  Yeah.  Because they, they've, they've been following us for a very long time.  Sorry, Anthony, but make it a little more dramatic.  Because the, because the mainstream media will not give you this little tidbit.  Yeah.  Well, uh, this, this, uh, killer whale, um, who goes by the, uh, name Shamu, but is really 
[00:08:00]  called Tilikum, uh, is responsible for a few deaths.  Mm-hmm.  This, uh, woman that was killed dragged down to the depths of the tank by the killer whale  and drowned.  How did that happen, though?  She wasn't in the water, right?  Uh, there's conflicting reports, depending on who you talk to.  Uh-huh.  Some people say, uh, and this is, uh, the SeaWorld people are saying she fell into the 
[00:08:30]  water and was dragged down.  Others are saying.  A trainer's gonna fall into the water?  Others are saying the whale was being very rambunctious beforehand and came up, grabbed  her, and dragged her into the water and down to her death.  And other reports say that it got her in the parking lot.  Yeah, yeah.  She was getting something out of the trunk of her car and he snuck up behind her, dressed  as an attendant.  Is it?  Yeah.  And he did, it was, he fucking sliced her with a, with a blade.  Isn't that great, though, that, you know, you really don't have to worry about that? 
[00:09:00]  Like, if you're walking around the streets, you don't have to go like, fuck, a killer whale  or a shark can get me.  Do you understand where I'm at?  I can shit talk it.  Yeah, yeah.  Any whale that wants a piece of it, you know where to get me?  Go ahead.  Come and get me.  That's why those Jaws movies were just a bunch of pieces of shit.  Well, everyone goes swimming a little bit.  Especially the, especially the 3D one where all she had to do was avoid the water and she  would be fine.  Just stay away.  But she had to go to the Caribbean, really?  We'll move to the Midwest. 
[00:09:30]  You're fine.  Right.  The shark will never, ever get you.  Don't work on a, on a, on a middle of the ocean oil thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Just don't do it.  Go on boats.  Don't do it.  Just live, live in Iowa.  There you go.  I don't think it was been one, a shark, a shark attack in a cornfield.  No, not one.  Well, this killer whale definitely has a problem.  This woman, dead, dragged to her death.  Um, this Tilikum was involved in another death of a, uh, Park employee that was, uh, uh, Tilikum 
[00:10:00]  and two other killer whales.  So, ganged up on one of these employees and killed that person.  But, uh, we can go back a few years.  Tilikum's first fatality.  One of our, uh, most famous stories ever.  Oh, I loved it.  It's a really old bit, but.  And this might explain why this, this whale is so pissed off. 
[00:10:30]  A gentleman was found in Tilikum's tank.  A big, uh, tank that they snooze in, I guess, uh, years ago.  Draped, as they say, draped over the whale's body.  Dead.  Nude.  Um, and there were reports that this gentleman was having sex with the whale's blowhole.  And what the whale did was, they have the potential when they go under, they clinched their blowhole 
[00:11:00]  closed so no water gets in there.  And when they come up, it opens up.  Um, reports were that, well, clinched down on this guy's dick, and probably balls.  Booyah!  Ah, booyah!  Ah, booyah!  And, uh, dragged him down to the murky depths by his cock in the blowhole as it was being raped where it breathes. 
[00:11:30]  Are you trying to say that Tilikum never forgot that incident?  Til, Til, Tilikum.  Tilikum.  Tilikum.  Tilikum.  Tilikum.  That is what the, uh, yeah.  Tilikum.  Right, right, right.  Tilikum.  With a name like that, how could you not fuck it in its blowhole?  Right.  And that's like the equivalent of just walking down the street and a mosquito jumps on you and holds your face and rapes your nose.  It just fucks your nostril.  It fucked his sinus.  Yeah.  It was fucking its nose.  And, uh, it must have made the whale angry because two more fatalities since that, uh, that pre-vert. 
[00:12:00]  I may have to correct Anthony, although I don't like to.  Yes, sir.  What?  I believe the first fatality was a trainer who fell in the water in 91.  Oh.  And that I think that this guy was the second.  The blowhole fucker was second?  Second.  I guess he didn't realize the reputation of this little fella.  No, it doesn't make any sense.  That's unbelievable.  Oh.  Maybe the whale just hates fucking tourists with mullets and wants to be in the ocean with his whale friends.  Well, they said Tilikum was a problem.  Yeah.  Problem.  Rambunctious.  Well, yeah, he was a problem because he never forgot his blowhole raping. 
[00:12:30]  Yep.  Oh, my God.  They're playing, uh, Wii, um, Olympic Wii on, uh, the news.  That's what they do now.  That's good.  We got it.  We got a killer whale that's killing people.  But you have to play.  Exactly.  You have to play Wii.  That's nice.  Look at how Jill works the Wiimote.  That's nice.  And that's John, who, he was the one yesterday that was kind of going, oh, I can't believe that guy said that to Hannah Storm.  I remember that hand action. 
[00:13:00]  Wait a minute.  Yeah, right on.  We're getting more, uh, news on this killer whale.  Drew in Orlando.  Drew?  Oh, oh, sorry.  I was just finishing up my road jerk after Anthony's hot story.  Yeah, that was hot, wasn't it?  Whale fucking?  The actual story, they got 400 retards down there filming this thing, and some of the folks were standing, like, right, right at the point of impact there.  So, what they're saying is that the girl's hair got caught from the whale's teeth, and he dragged her under and didn't even know she was there. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, Anheuser-Busch is just trying to cover their ass.  I mean, you know, they're going to get sued.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, but they'll pay that bill.  That's easy.  And I'm sure they'll be doing some Shamu shows by the weekend.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They don't even have to hose it down.  It's already hosed down.  Shamu goes up and then, poosh, hits the water.  Yeah.  And all the water goes all over.  Hosed down.  Hosed down and ready for action.  That's it. 
[00:14:00]  By Saturday, you'll forget there was a tragedy there.  Yeah.  You'll be there with your cameras and video cameras and little kids.  And eating their cotton candy.  Yeah.  Look out if you're in this area.  You're going to get a little wet.  You'll have your Shamu trinkets.  That's right.  That's right.  Ladies and gentlemen, let's go pick it up for Shamu.  Shamu comes out.  That's right.  Look at that.  Now, these animals are called killer whales.  But actually, that is a misnomer.  They are very gentle, very loving creatures. 
[00:14:30]  And the name killer whale has put these animals in harm's way by humans.  As that's going on.  Forgetting that this thing killed three people already.  As that's going on, you get a peek of the corner.  Yeah.  Mealing a body away.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The fucking stretchers out.  Yeah.  The corner's there.  It was a whir.  Yeah.  If you'll notice, now, this whale is flushing his teeth with a Nike. 
[00:15:00]  Sam, she went to hand it a fish and it bit her arm off.  Name what's that, but good.  Because Telecom is on the loose, dressed as a person.  He has a funny nose and fake mustache.  And Jim C's got to be there.  Yeah.  Like, why isn't Jim C back at the coroner's office doing an autopsy, but he's there?  At the press conference in his member's only jacket outside SeaWorld.  If you see a five-ton person walking around, it could be this whale. 
[00:15:30]  Walking around.  Sitting in the stands, just telling the people, please move back.  It's very dangerous.  The whale's at a punk rock concert.  Abigail.  This whale's been giving her codeine and fish.  Codeine.  She made an anison.  Anison.  She has a toothache.  He's giving her anison.  Anison.  The whale bit my girlfriend's ass off. 
[00:16:00]  He's swimming around my houseboat right now, Sam.  Looking for intrigue in action.  Intrigue?  There's no coroner that's having intrigue in his life.  Stop it, Quincy.  Quincy does, yeah.  Well, I didn't know they were all named Shamu, Anthony.  That's a very good fun fact today.  And do they move these killer whales around after they kill somebody, kind of like they  do with the priests?  Yeah, the Catholic Church.  Like the Catholic Church? 
[00:16:30]  They just move them around to a different parish.  Yeah, because this whale was somewhere else before it went to SeaWorld.  But, I don't know.  Oh, Stephen S. from Bayshore just got a news tease he wants everyone to know about.  A killer whale slaughters its trainer.  Could it happen in your neighborhood?  Tune in at 11.  We'll tell you where it could happen.  Yeah, if you work at SeaWorld.  Yeah, we can kind of figure that out.  Yeah.  E-Rock.  Oh, he's not responsible for this death. 
[00:17:00]  Is he wearing a black and white shirt?  Yeah, that's why Eric's neck hurts.  He had a leg injury.  That's what happened.  He was thrashing the trainer about in the water.  He'd need his neck.  Can we get a makeup artist to make E-Rock into a killer whale for the day?  Yes, the makeup artist is called nature.  E-Rock writes, we will be playing the old bit of Man, Fucking, Whale, and Tank at end of the show.  I don't even know if it holds up.  Stick around for that one.  Yeah, till I come. 
[00:17:30]  Although, when I made that mistake and said killer come, that's...  Yeah, killer come.  Well, sure.  The killer whale that goes under the ruse name, Shamu.  They're saying, some people are saying they should let it go.  Like a free willy kind of thing.  Just let it go.  Just don't kill the fucking dick.  Back where it goes.  I hate when they kill the animals for doing what they're supposed to be doing.  It's called a killer whale.  Right.  And if you get that close, you know, you look like a steak to these damn animals. 
[00:18:00]  They don't know any better.  They don't know shit.  All they want to do is shit and eat.  That's it.  People think because they do those cute little tricks and they come up and it's like, now  the trainer is going to give the whale a little kiss.  And they give a little kiss on the mouth and the whale opens its mouth and does a stupid  little backwards swim move thing.  Everybody goes, oh, look.  It knows what it's doing.  It has no idea what it's doing.  No clue.  It's going, I want to bite this motherfucker's head off.  You ever swim with the dolphins? 
[00:18:30]  No.  No.  You swim with the dolphins because they try to make it look like the dolphins know exactly  who you are.  Oh, yeah.  They want to interact with human beings.  Like a flipper.  The trainer is completely controlling everything with those little fishies.  Yeah, the fish.  Making them do things that the dolphin's just doing to eat.  It's all about the little fish.  The dolphin's not actually trying to shake your hand or wave to you.  It wants the little fish from the damn trainer.  Doesn't give a shit about you.  It's all about the little fishy.  It has no idea you're on the side there, you know, taking in the action. 
[00:19:00]  The little fish and the fucking little hand motion that the trainer makes before it gets  the fish.  Yeah.  Then the thing goes, oh, I'm getting a fish.  It's not sitting there going, oh, this is going to be fun.  I'm going to swim with a people person.  Sure.  No.  So, I don't know what this means.  Bruce in North Carolina, help me out.  What do you got?  Morning, boys.  Good morning, Bruce.  Hello.  Hey, Bruce.  Thanks for calling.  I was just listening to your whale story. 
[00:19:30]  And it gives all new meaning of fuck the whales, doesn't it?  No.  I don't really know what this is.  Is this an old reference?  New meaning?  It used to be a, you know, fuck the whales, nuke the whales.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Man's listening to himself.  Have fun listening to himself.  He's thinking, maybe the phone didn't really capture their laughter.  Maybe I have to listen on the radio to really hear the guffaws. 
[00:20:00]  Come down to your participating Carvel Ice Cream dealer, where we have Fudgy the Whale.  Well, leg and arm not included.  Right on.  Guy sticks his dick in the cake.  He's got to fuck whales.  Kids crying at their birthday.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Get your dick out of the cake.  I can't help it.  Fudgy's so cute. 
[00:20:30]  Rich, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  How you doing?  Pretty good, buddy.  Uh, the, uh, the family of the trainer has already said that, uh, she died doing what  she loved best.  Drowning?  Yeah.  Breathing water into her lungs.  Drowning.  Yeah, that, that dying, uh, doing what, that's just ridiculous.  You never hear that from the family of a social worker who was brutally raped and murdered  by a black gentleman.  Unless you're a size queen in life.  Yeah, dying, uh, doing something you like is just overrated. 
[00:21:00]  I once heard from a person who drowned and, uh, actually came back and, uh, asked them  what it was like to drown and they said, felt like going home.  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Come on.  What movie?  Oh, I asked him if it was drowning and he said it was like going home.  It's like going home and then at the end he tells them, no, it was the most painful experience 
[00:21:30]  ever.  Uh.  Oh, that was, uh, Close Encounters.  Ah, yes, exactly.  The Prestige.  I never saw that movie.  Oh, yeah, and I saw that movie.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Come over to the Pantages.  Oh.  Oh, this is really true.  I think Mike is on to something.  He tries so very hard.  Mike in Texas.  Mike.  Hey, if that trainer had just washed her vag a little bit, then the poor little, uh, 
[00:22:00]  whale wouldn't have mistaken her for a tasty treat.  Oh, my goodness.  Are you, are you insinuating that she smelled so bad that the, the, the whale thought it  was a fish?  The trainer?  Jennifer Aniston.  Yes.  Leave her and her stupid pussy alone.  Oh, God.  Uh.  I can't make feelings about stuff like this because, like, I really, you feel bad for,  this woman probably was very, like, loved animals.  Oh, of course.  It was probably very good. 
[00:22:30]  And having them in captivity is kind of shitty, but it does make people, like, feel connected  to them and love them.  Yeah.  So, like, people are outraged when people, like, there's wailing involved.  It's kind of hard to really figure out how I feel on this.  I probably should have just thought that instead of saying it.  What are you trying to say?  For real.  That I feel that, uh, these, these animals should be free.  It's a fucking five ton animal.  It's not meant to be entertaining people wearing fucking Jimmy Buffett t-shirts while  they applaud.  It should be in the ocean eating whatever they eat. 
[00:23:00]  Or how about, at the very least, they make the tanks a lot larger?  Even, even the tanks they hold them in when they're not performing, you know, kind of behind  the scenes are, are small spaces.  That's true.  So it's more convenient for the trainers and, uh, and, uh, I don't know, and whatever.  Well, at the very least, why don't you make, uh, their space a little larger?  It's, uh.  A lot larger.  It's going to be a problem for us, I'll tell you, because in the future, there aren't going  to be any whales.  An alien ship's going to come around and send a signal out that a whale has to get back 
[00:23:30]  to.  Star Trek.  That's goddamn right.  God damn.  And I hate Star Trek.  That's it.  Although I enjoyed the movie.  The new movie, I really, really enjoyed it.  Yes.  I really enjoyed that one.  Uh, let's say hi to Frank in Staten Island.  Frank.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey there, Frank.  Good.  Hey, man.  It was just a matter of time before this happened.  I don't know why people are so surprised. 
[00:24:00]  Think about it.  They jump in there with a black wetsuit on, and what's a killer whale's favorite meal?  Seals.  A seal.  Yeah.  Dana Whales know the difference.  He didn't think that she was a seal.  Well, I think she was.  I am.  Maybe.  In the glasses.  I think she was just pulled in from the side.  I don't know.  Whatever.  I need glasses.  You know what?  Let's just summarize.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  They'll be doing fucking Shamu shows by, by, they'll probably have to take today off.  It probably kills them that they're taking today off.  Yeah.  And they'll be, uh, back at it by tomorrow. 
[00:24:30]  They have to.  It's, it's a giant industry.  What are they going to do?  Shut it down?  No, they're not.  Somebody, uh, doing what they love.  You really think your life's important, but, uh, they're probably doing shows today.  Yeah.  With, like, maybe a quick moment of, they won't even do a moment of silence, because  they don't want to even acknowledge anything bad happens.  Yeah.  Uh.  Saying she died doing what she loves is like saying a fish died doing what it loves when  it's in the boat going.  You know when the fish is, like, just going. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Doing the mouth thing, because its gills don't know what to do with air.  That's what, that's what she did.  That's how she died doing what she loved.  When you see the fish flopping around like that, you don't point out and go, nice lungs,  dick.  Yeah.  Nice.  You could breathe underwater.  They couldn't figure out how to do both?  I go, look, us humans figured it out.  Look at me.  Yeah.  We, we start in the water.  Look, we breathe just fine up here on the boat.  Mmm.  Good air.  It is amazing how long they could last breathing in, uh, air, though. 
[00:25:30]  Like, a fish will just sit there for a while doing that stupid mouth thing.  Boop!  Boop!  And the gills flapping.  Mmm.  Do they get any oxygen from that?  I, I, my, my, my brother's a marine biologist.  Yeah.  I bet you he would say no.  Yeah?  That they, that the gills can't pull any oxygen out of the air?  Oh, maybe.  Is there, I don't know.  I would think, because it's like, you know, I filter the, the water through their gills  and pull the oxygen out of that.  We pull it out of the air, but water, wow, that won't do any good.  That, that kind of hurts us. 
[00:26:00]  No, that's not fun.  It should be easy, though.  Why can't we just breathe water?  We probably did at one point.  That'd be nice.  See, you just breathe in your lungs, you sit in there, and, and, and, and then your little  alveoli sucks the fucking oxygen out of the water.  What's the problem?  Let's go to Psycho Bob.  Psycho!  Give it a try.  Let's see if it works with E-Rock.  You know what, dude?  Oh, wrong Bob.  Psycho.  Psycho Bob.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, it's been a while.  What's up, brother?  Hey, I was wondering if I had to be a talk to Shamu about this and seeing how Shamu feels. 
[00:26:30]  What happened?  Never mind.  He goes, never mind.  Please, that didn't happen.  That call never took place.  What happened?  He was trying to set us up for a bit.  I wonder how Shamu feels.  Oh, oh.  I don't know.  Why don't you tell us?  Yeah.  Why do we have to be the ones always entertaining us?  How about you do the fucking bit?  Yeah, improv master.  Sorry. 
[00:27:00]  Thanks, Bud Abbott.  Fuck are we.  So Shamu's on first.  Fudgy the Whale's on second.  And Willie's on third.  All right, we got it.  We have another guy.  Look at this.  Johnny Rock from Hilton Head.  Johnny Rock.  Good morning, gentlemen.  I would like to get a report from Mr. Jesse Ventura.  Greg.  Tony Show.  Greg.  Tony Show.  Greg.  Tony Show.  Is there something wrong with people today? 
[00:27:30]  Well, it's...  Maybe the snow in the northeast here.  I don't know.  Huh?  People are very odd today.  They really are.  Very odd.  Let's go to Pattistan Island.  Pat.  Pat.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Yeah, I hear that on Saturday, they're going to have a guest trainer.  It's going to be Henry Winkler.  And he's jet skiing in now.  That's funny.  That is.  In his leather jacket.  Very good.  Was it a shark or a whale, though? 
[00:28:00]  It was a shark.  It was a shark.  It was a shark tank.  And he jumped the shark.  Or it would be called Jump the Whale.  Bob.  Oh, true.  Bob the Trucker.  Bob.  Hey there, Babb.  Hey, congratulations, Ope.  Oh, thank you, Bob.  Oh, you're welcome.  Hey, I've been to the SeaWorld shows.  They bring a kid up out of the audience and let them pet the thing.  Can you imagine if that thing would have ate it?  Yeah.  Every show, they do have a little kid thing.  It's a kid.  Yeah.  And they have cute music and the kid gets to interact with the killer whale a little bit 
[00:28:30]  and the whole audience goes, oh.  Imagine, yeah, if the killer whale grabbed the kid and went under.  Holy crap.  You would get your money's worth, at least.  Oh, yeah.  They would just send it off and get that woman that played Precious to replace Tillicum.  Just put a fin on her back.  And just throw fish at her.  Yeah.  Or throw those fucking fried chicken legs that she was running around with before she vomited.  What a fantastic movie. 
[00:29:00]  A hoot.  A laugh in every scene is my review.  All right.  Well, that's how we start the show.  God, the phones are lit, but I don't know.  Whatever.  We're going to do other things.  What?  Well, I mean, where do you want to go?  This guy thinks he knows about the pool.  Sam in Atlanta.  Sam.  Yeah.  Bubble Boy.  Hey.  Welcome to Jimmy.  Sam.  The reason that tank is so small is because they're still using the shorter cattle prods  that they've used over the years. 
[00:29:30]  Do they cattle prods?  Punch it out.  Punch it out.  I don't hit them with cattle prods.  What is going on with these guys today?  They have no idea how to work this subject.  Victor in Baltimore.  Victor.  Victor.  Hey.  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  There is a fish that can live out of water for like a day or two.  They call it the frankenfish.  In Maryland, somebody brought one and set it free because it got too big and they couldn't  feed it.  And it started infesting ponds and stuff, and it would actually get out of one pond. 
[00:30:00]  It's one that walks.  To another.  Yeah.  It walks on its little fins.  Yeah.  We've talked about the frankenfish.  But it has like...  There's videos online.  It's creepy because they could walk right out of the water and walk right into another pond  now infesting that pond.  Doesn't it have like lungs and gills or something like that?  I don't know like the details.  I'm not sure.  All I know is this thing could walk out of the water and does.  It's just frightening.  And I don't know how long it could survive out of the water before it needs to get back  into the...  Snakehead?  Snakehead fish?  Yes.  But I think they do call it frankenfish because it's just... 
[00:30:30]  Thank you.  I'm a fan in D.C.  Yeah.  It's called a...  Yeah.  The videos are online.  It's like a big sperm cell.  It's fucking...  What is some Asian woman kicking it?  Grace.  God.  Why don't you bring it home and...  What's wrong with you?  Chop it up for lunch.  Why don't you just fix the fucking brakes on your cars and your accelerators?  Yes.  Stop being obsessed with the walking fish and yeah.  Yeah.  Make sure the brakes are working.  Take it home.  Chop it in a blender.  Eat it.  And then do a headstand and shit it out and put it on some sex fucking website. 
[00:31:00]  That's pretty much...  But...  But...  Pixelate out your pubic hairs.  You sick fucking...  Bastards.  They are really disturbed.  How the hell did...  Oh, okay.  Frankenfish sounds like a sci-fi movie.  Dirty Dan certainly does.  Steve, the trucker.  Steve.  Anthony.  Yes, sir.  I got a question for you.  You never cease to amaze me.  How the hell did you know that that was called an alveoli? 
[00:31:30]  That's where the transfer of oxygen happens between the very small blood vessels in the lungs and the air pocket, which is the alveoli.  How did you know that?  I don't know.  I think I just learned it kind of on a discovery channel or something.  Yeah, but we all learn shit, but then we decide not to remember it.  For some reason, you remember all the stuff.  It sticks with me.  It is bizarre.  Certain things just stick in my brain.  Other things go away really quickly. 
[00:32:00]  Like what the boss says.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Like meetings.  When we have meetings, that shit is replaced by just useless information.  But the good thing is, the meeting is usually useless information.  So, I don't know where to put that.  Exactly.  Great.  All right.  We're going to cut our losses.  The phones are still lit, but we're going to move on to other things after the break.  We got a taste of our We Are the World song.  The final song will be what? 
[00:32:30]  Available tomorrow?  Yeah.  It's dropping tomorrow, Sam?  We're looking at dropping the song tomorrow for tomorrow's show.  Wow.  And the clips you brought me are much better than the clips I had the other day?  Yes.  These are actual clips from the song.  Oh, nice.  Although, they're the single tracks.  Raw tracks.  Yeah.  You'll be able to highlight different singers.  Now, will you hear the music and the singers?  No.  These are just isolated vocal tracks?  Just the dry tracks. 
[00:33:00]  Wow.  Okay.  This is like a Linda McCartney kind of a thing when they isolated her tracks and she sounded  like shit.  Precisely.  Great.  All right.  We're going to play some of these clips after the break.  The We Are the World thing.  Nice.  Also, maybe we'll talk a little hockey.  A little hockey.  Watch any of the games last night?  No.  I just know the USA won.  All right.  We'll do that.  It was three o'clock that game started.  They're like, I was going to fucking sit there and watch a goddamn hockey game at three o'clock  in the afternoon.  Oh, hell yeah.  No, I was busy. 
[00:33:30]  They're saying that was the most exciting game of the Olympics.  Very busy sleeping.  I still think the Canada-USA game was more exciting, but yesterday's game was pretty rocky.  Now, what has to happen for Canada to play the U.S. again?  They both just have to win now.  That's it.  If they both win their next games, then it becomes like, holy shit.  That will be the game.  Yes.  Wow.  That's it, I think.  That'll be sick.  I think that's what we're down to.  They both just have to win now. 
[00:34:00]  That game I would watch.  And I want that to happen.  Yeah, who doesn't?  Who else are we playing?  Like, who are we playing this time?  We got Finland, right?  Finland?  I think we got Finland and Canada's got...  We should beat them, right?  Slovakia.  Slovakia?  Canada should beat them, right?  I'm thinking.  I'm looking at U.S.-Canada.  I'm thinking this is setting up nice for a little rematch.  It could be a nice rematch.  Which I'm definitely scared of because I think Canada outplayed, you know, us.  You know what the United States... 
[00:34:30]  But Ryan Miller was standing on his head.  Standing on his head.  Yeah.  You know what the United States knows how to do?  Bring it.  The U.S. knows how to bring it when the pressure's on like that.  All right.  Maybe there were more shots on goal last time.  And the goalie there, Miller, was standing on his head, apparently.  I didn't see the game.  Miller was definitely standing on his head.  That must have been a sight to see.  And Hiller was standing on his head.  Hiller and Miller.  Well, it was a law firm.  Yeah.  They had to remind us that it sounded like a law firm yesterday. 
[00:35:00]  Did they go...  You had Hiller and Goal for the dirty fucking Swiss.  Yeah.  And you had Miller...  You had Miller and Goal for the good old U.S. of A.  We want to apologize to any lawyers that were offended by our lawyer joke that we made.  They made the joke way too many times.  Sounds like a law firm.  Hiller and Miller.  Hiller and Miller.  A puck would come up and fucking crack his skull open.  Yeah.  But Hiller had well over 40 saves. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  I mean, we barely squeaked by the dirty Swiss.  But let me tell you.  Like I said, bring it.  It has already been brought in.  Brought in.  And you know, it's going to be a good game today, but you're going to laugh.  But women's hockey.  They're playing for the goal today.  And it is U.S. versus Canada.  Really?  I'm telling you.  Does anyone care, though?  Because it's worth women talking.  They hate each other.  Yes.  Yes.  Do they check each other with their tits? 
[00:36:00]  Tomorrow...  Do they bang their tits against each other?  They're animals, actually.  Tomorrow, I guarantee people will call and go, holy shit, did you see that game?  I've actually seen...  The teams hate each other.  They don't look like women.  Because they got the equipment on and stuff.  They really don't look like women.  They look like NHL players from the late 70s.  With the Ron Duguay hair.  They look like they could have played in the late 70s in the NHL.  That's the skill level, I think, they're sort of up to.  Skill level?  Yes.  Do they goon it up at all?  You're not really allowed to fight.  Yeah? 
[00:36:30]  Like, kick them in the pussy?  They're not allowed to fight, which is kind of good because it makes them hit harder.  Because they really want to get their aggression out by just knocking someone over the boards.  So they do hit?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I've been impressed with the women's hockey in the Olympics.  I get beat up by saying that, but it's pretty impressive.  One whole team just trying to sync up all of their periods for the big game.  That would be great.  They're all just syncing up their periods.  Can you imagine you lose the gold because everyone is on their period? 
[00:37:00]  Everyone's on the rag and just fucking the other team up.  There's just blood all over the ice and no one's cut.  They just got to keep coming out and cleaning the ice.  They don't know why.  Oh, I thought it was the red line.  What happened?  That's fucking good, man.  Let me go to Matt here.  Matt in Toronto.  Opie, I'm with you 100%.  I want to see a Canada-U.S. rematch.  And I think you guys are in tough. 
[00:37:30]  You want to talk about Bring It, Anthony?  Yes.  Look at what Canada did to the Russians last night.  We blew through them.  Stop with we blew.  All right.  It's the United States.  USA.  We bring it.  Not fucking stupid rooshkies.  I'm flying out tomorrow to see the last three games.  And I will call you guys.  Hope you crash.  Hope you have a party in Monday morning.  Sorry, Jim.  And I will be on the phone call and be celebrating.  Well, I mean, yeah. 
[00:38:00]  I mean, Russia, Anthony, had a really good team.  And Canada did beat them.  What was the final score?  8-2, I believe.  It doesn't matter.  Don't you understand?  8-2.  This is destiny.  This is destiny for the United States.  What are you, trying to start your own sports curse?  That's what I'm doing.  No, I just, I know this.  Be quiet.  USA.  Let's be quiet on this one.  Number one.  We are the bestest.  I know.  It is destined for greatness. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, yeah.  This is a little fun fact for you.  Brian in Cleveland.  Brian.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Good, Brian.  Good.  There's twin girls that play for the U.S. hockey team.  They're both blonde, smoking hot, and they have matching tattoos.  They're fucking ridiculous.  What?  Yep.  Punch that up.  Yep.  Come on, young Samuel.  There's no clue what their names are because they're bitches that play hockey, so who cares?  And you know what?  They're really hot.  I don't know their names either.  You're right.  But I bet you they look hot, but if you saw them out of their hockey gear, they're probably  a bit on the large side. 
[00:39:00]  Let me see.  Jimmy, can't wait to see you tomorrow night, guys.  Punch it out.  Thank you, buddy.  You're going to see Jimmy at the House of Blues in Cleveland.  Absolutely.  I've seen him four times now.  Good.  Killed it every time.  Thank you for having me.  Yeah, man.  Make sure you see Jimmy.  Jimmy's going out of his way to try to get to Cleveland.  He's leaving the show early to beat the weather out.  So the least you guys could do is make sure you go see Jimmy at the House of Blues in Cleveland.  I moonwalk at the end.  Oh.  I want to see that part.  What do you think, Ant?  It's just the blonde hair that's making them look kind of good. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, that's...  Put some crooked fucking taped glasses on them, and they're the Hanson brothers.  I really am not feeling it with these two.  Hey, for female hockey players, based on that, fucking tens.  Oh, geez.  Look how frumpy.  They're hunched over.  Oof.  No.  No.  The one on the right's not bad.  The one on the right is not bad, because the one on the left is awful.  Wow, man.  You know what?  Because in their hockey gear, they kind of look all right, but yeah, you put them in normal clothes. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, their bodies are too weirdly athletic.  They're hunched over, like, I guess because, you know, you've got to hold that stick and hunch over a little bit.  So they have horrible posture, and they have, like, strong bodies and little boobies.  You bring up a good point, Ant.  I work out a lot, right?  And I'm in the gym the other day.  Oh, yeah.  These goddamn women are catching up to us, men.  I actually saw a woman doing men push-ups.  Really? 
[00:40:30]  Yes.  That's like seeing a guy do girly push-ups.  Well, the women, throughout the years, have done the girl push-up, which is you keep your knees on the floor.  Yeah.  Not anymore, man.  You keep your knees on the floor, bitch.  Not anymore.  That's what I say.  Not anymore.  Oh.  There's something going on out there.  The women are starting to do fucking men push-ups.  What's that about?  They want to catch up.  Well, the evolution, it's getting close.  It's getting close.  I don't know. 
[00:41:00]  I like a nice shapely girl, but not...  Women don't understand that anymore.  They have to go to the gym and look like men now.  I'm not into the rock hard fucking, you know.  I don't want to run my hand over a chick's ass and feel like, you know, Schwarzenegger circa 75.  You know?  I like a nice fucking curved...  You need a little softness?  Soft.  I'm with you.  It's wonderful.  You don't want Madonna?  No.  Like Madonna's arms and stuff?  Oh, that's good.  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  It's like fucking running your hand over a chicken wing.  A raw chicken wing.  All you're feeling is cartilage, bone, and ligament.  Who needs that?  Yeah, you're right.  You know?  You want a girl with some nice, you know, little bit of meat on her.  Or at least smooth, soft.  Not anorexic.  But just nice.  And this guy's going to make me look like a fool.  But it has to happen.  Colonel in Georgia. 
[00:42:00]  Hey, Gregory.  I want to call you out.  Women's hockey.  No checking allowed.  Sorry.  I've seen a couple of games.  Then what the hell are they doing instead of checking?  No checking?  Say, excuse me?  May I have the puck, please?  Huh?  They're afraid of the boobies getting hurt.  So no checking allowed.  No.  Is that why?  Can't be.  Why?  I need a...  I see some rough play.  So what are they doing then?  Absolutely no checking.  Checking's a two minute.  Sitting at the sin bin.  That's dumb. 
[00:42:30]  Let them fucking check.  Let them beat the shit out of each other, man.  Girls hate each other.  It would be fucking...  It would be great.  Girls hate each other way more than guys hate each other.  Oh, yes.  If they check each other, they have to sit in the penalty cock?  Yes.  They'd be fucking dildo on the seat.  Thank you.  Thank you for that, Colonel.  Why sit on that bitch?  Hey, this guy has something.  Joe in Cleveland.  Joe?  Chlamydia?  Yeah, baby.  Hey.  What's up, Joe?  How are you doing?  Pretty good, man. 
[00:43:00]  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Bye.  I love you guys.  And a long-time listener.  I call a couple times.  Oh, my God, sir.  This guy's just useless.  Go ahead.  Completely useless.  Actually, the real point of this conversation is that I don't have tickets to see Jimmy at  House of Blues because every time he comes to Cleveland, it sells out in about a minute  and a half.  And there's some single seats up in the nosebleed, and then my girlfriend and I can't even sit  next to each other.  She just tells you that, sir, because she doesn't want to sit next to you.  It is true.  Unfortunately, I'm the one looking for the tickets while I'm going to work all the goddamn 
[00:43:30]  day.  Oh, you want tickets for a Jim Norton show?  Dude, I would love tickets for Jim Norton.  Saw that one coming.  I'm going to give you a taste of the We Are the World song after this break.  Oh, I can't wait.  Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton for a little while longer.  Stay there.  Anyone?  Spirit in the Sky. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, that sounds very 80s.  What's that 80s sound to it?  Muse.  What?  Are you into Muse?  Oh, I've heard of them, yes.  They're fucking great, actually.  They're playing the garden, I think.  I would love to get some of those guys on the show, but that ain't happening.  Are we going to get cop-out guys or not?  Oh, no.  Yes.  What's Kevin Smith saying? 
[00:44:30]  Is he going to just surprise us and walk in one day?  Saying I have an all-nighter?  I have a hit movie.  With Warner Brothers and I got to kind of make believe I'm not friends with you guys for  a while.  Yeah, with a giant fucking...  I have a hit movie with a giant fucking movie company.  When are we going to get respect?  I don't think Kevin's like...  Kevin's like, when you talk to him, you saw this.  He's so happy to see it.  There's nothing phony about Kevin.  It's really weird.  I'm not saying there's any issues at all.  I think it's a political thing because I don't think he's doing our show. 
[00:45:00]  And he's done our show many, many times.  And he's got this big movie coming out Friday that's going to do very, very well.  And we just want to say hi to our pal.  Maybe talk a little Olympic hockey.  His boy Brodeur is still in it.  Although he sat yesterday.  Loves the hockey.  Yeah, he loves the hockey.  Kevin Smith, thumbs up, thumbs down?  No, thumbs, I don't.  Thumbs, kind of like...  I really don't know.  Normally, these guys are easy enough to get a hold.  Thank you.  Tell them to come in and we'll just make believe it's somebody else.  Because we just want to hang out with them. 
[00:45:30]  Kevin, Sean, William Scott, I've always been able to get a hold of them personally and always  get responses.  And up until the end of last week, they were both coming in.  And then the responses stopped.  Yay.  God, our reputation just sucks out there.  I wonder if they're only doing Warner Brothers approved publicity.  I'm thinking our reputation just blows.  What do we have to do?  What do we have to do less of?  How about yay pudding? 
[00:46:00]  You know, Ann, if I really thought that's all it would take, then I would stop yay pudding  tomorrow.  It isn't.  But I think our reputation is still just really based on the older, older version of this  show.  It is.  We have a rep.  I really do.  It doesn't go away.  I really believe it's more based on the sex for Sam and all that stuff.  Girls bleeding and running out of buildings naked. 
[00:46:30]  You know, that type of thing.  But we haven't done that in almost a decade.  I know.  But there's still publicists who remember that shit.  That's what I'm thinking.  Yeah.  And there's interviews that may not have gone well, even five years ago, and those publicists  are still involved with these companies.  Oh, for us.  And that's who controls these press schedules.  And they see Opie and Anthony on the schedule, and they just cross it off.  They go, nope.  And there's nobody speaking for the show.  Not that Steve doesn't, but I mean, nobody who talks their language, speaking to them 
[00:47:00]  going, no, you guys, this is what happened.  There's nobody speaking for the show.  Well, we got Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.  Bob.  Bob.  Bob a bully would be better off speaking for the show.  No confidence in Bob.  It's not that I have no confidence, but Bob can't talk to publicists.  They don't know who he is, and they don't give a fuck about it.  That doesn't even fit the job description.  Jesus.  Yeah.  It's got to be, you know, somebody.  What?  I sent you guys an email.  I know I got that. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, I know.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  I got that one.  I got it.  Okay.  Can I do it?  Very good.  Need somebody talking.  Come in there.  Beep, bada, beep, bada, boop.  One talks to the other.  Bada, beep, bada, boop, bada, boop.  Bada, boop, bada, bada, bada, beep.  Who wants to talk?  I think we just need an explanation, because we've known Kevin for so long, and I think  we would understand just about any explanation.  The only one we wouldn't understand is, well, I actually now hate you fucking guys. 
[00:48:00]  Aw.  But I don't think that's the case.  I don't think that's it.  So I just want an explanation, even if it's a behind-the-scenes explanation.  He's busy, too.  He's probably sleeping.  That guy's been going at a ridiculous pace getting this movie done and getting it out.  He's snoozing.  He knows it's good, so he doesn't have to run around like an idiot fucking chimp, trying  to get his movie.  But he comes in out of his way when he has nothing to promote. 
[00:48:30]  That's where I'm getting at.  So if he's in New York, he just likes doing the show, and we like having him on.  We'd like to see him in his overcoat walking down that hall.  Well, yeah.  We just would like to do that.  If I was him, I'd be sleeping, going, I got a great movie that's opening tomorrow.  Fuck everyone.  I'm sleeping.  But then he's going to fly back to L.A., and then we don't see him for a while.  This is what a nice dude he is.  We saw him the other night, and my girlfriend didn't want to meet anybody but him.  He was the only guy. 
[00:49:00]  She's like, I got to get a picture with Kevin Smith.  She didn't want to, not Bruce Willis, but only him.  So she meets him, and there's a dude.  He's surrounded by people.  He talks.  They take a photo.  He's chat.  He's very nice.  But 10 minutes later, I get a text from him.  He goes, oh, tell your girl I'm sorry.  I'm not always that distracted, but I was just sort of like hoping that he didn't come  off.  I'm like, dude, it didn't even sound like that.  But it's like he really is not a guy who loses touch with the people he's friends with.  I think Warner Brothers just sets it up, and he might even be back in L.A. at this point.  I don't know if he's even in New York.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:49:30]  If you get some info, let us know there, Steve.  Thank you.  Anthony.  But if I get a hold of that motherfucker, I'm like talking shit.  And Sean William Scott loves doing the show.  So I think it might be a Warner Brothers thing.  Something's going on.  It's obvious something's going on.  I just want to know.  Do you think they have to do, and I should probably know this, but I don't.  I wonder if they have to do only studio-approved publicity.  Like, I wonder if studios...  My base.  Studio goes, here's what you're doing.  We set up the press, and you do the press that we give you, and that's it.  And that's it.  Right.  I would like to know.  That's all. 
[00:50:00]  I bet that is the case.  Anthony, John Montone.  You brought this to everyone's attention.  He's trying to come up with a...  John Montone.  Trying to come up with a new word called snorricane.  Right?  Snorricane.  Yeah.  I guess we've got a big storm moving into the New York City area.  I don't know.  It's probably going to be more of a bus for New York City and Long Island, but west of  the city and north of the city, it's going to be a disaster.  They're still preaching like six to eight.  Six to eight inches?  For the city.  Okay.  A little less out of Long Island.  But, oh my God, north, west, south, oh, look out. 
[00:50:30]  It's insanity.  And 15 mile an hour winds, hence the term snorricane that John Montone is really trying to get popular.  And we've got a little clip of John Montone for the people.  With time to waste as we await the arrival of this monster storm steaming up from the south,  New Yorkers have come up with names for the combination snow with hurricane winds.  Snorricane has emerged as the favorite, and one Latin American fellow called it Tormenta. 
[00:51:00]  And Tony, who's out here hawking umbrellas, knows that...  He's got to be crazy.  I know he's got to say there's going to be a crazy storm today.  Crazy.  Crazy.  That much is true.  John Montone, 10-10 winds, out in the rain.  Yeah, in the rain.  What a waste of time that was.  Was the guy spinning the umbrella? 
[00:51:30]  Selling them?  Because you know who started that.  What?  Jerry.  Seinfeld?  Of course.  He's doing my spin.  Funny episode.  What are you going to do?  I don't...  Fucking fantastic.  I don't think I saw that one.  Every fucking episode.  There are still a bunch of episodes I've just never seen.  Great.  I'm trying to catch up, now that it's been, what, 10 years that it's been off the air.  Yeah, that it's been off the air.  He's actually writing a book, by the way. 
[00:52:00]  Really?  Tell all?  About his small pee-pee?  Because she saw that he's doing...  I want to know what Seinfeld's packing.  I'm curious.  He's either four and a half or nine.  He's got to be nine because he's so confident.  But he's doing the marriage ref, and she saw that, and she's like,  Well, that's a joke because he would never marry me.  So she's now coming out and trying to use his marriage ref that he's producing  to kind of, I guess, push her buck.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  And what, do they go out for a summer or something?  No, eight years.  Oh, eight years?  85, like, 93.  Oh, wow.  But it's like, he's married. 
[00:52:30]  He's been married for 10 years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Good for her.  Whatever.  Everyone's trying to make their fucking dime.  Dude, do you know how many people are going to claw to the woodwork if I ever hit,  like, iconic status?  Do you understand the amount of people that will contribute?  Oh, God.  Not long, just like one chapter each?  Yes.  Ugh.  The humiliation.  I don't care.  Write it up, you whores.  Get your fucking little heads together and put it down on paper. 
[00:53:00]  Too good.  Too good.  Well, Daddy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  And he pretended he didn't know.  Old thick fact.  We got a taste of the We Are the World song that Troy and Sam and a few other people have  been working on behind the scenes, Anthony.  Yeah.  The full song will be on the show tomorrow.  Right?  Fingers crossed.  So, fingers crossed.  I was hearing it's going to be done. 
[00:53:30]  I'm quite confident.  We've been doing a lot of work on it.  It's all recorded.  It was all laid out yesterday.  It's in the final mixing stages.  Mixing, tuning.  Yeah, just kind of fine-tuning, getting it all.  Tweaking.  Perfect tweaking.  Right there.  And it features all the people you know, love, and hate from this radio show.  Now, these are the raw tracks?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's what we're talking.  And this is with the music eliminated.  And all the effects and all that.  Now, normally, the person hears the music in their headphones when you're laying down your 
[00:54:00]  track.  And you sing along in the mic.  And to you, it sounds like, you know, I'm hearing the music and I'm singing.  But now, the recording has got all this separate, so you can mix it, you know, separate from  the music.  So you take these tracks and isolate them without the music, and you've got yourself a genuine  clusterfuck.  It's been driving Troy out of his mind, because, like, he produces real music, and is like 
[00:54:30]  an audio guy.  Yeah.  And so he's, like, you know, trying to make everything perfect, and I keep telling him,  no, just leave it alone, and it's driving him insane, because he's trying to make it...  Tell him, don't fucking lose sleep over it.  Yeah.  Don't worry, trying to make this sound good.  It's not going to.  It's the thought that counts.  Well, we got...  Remember, Haiti.  No idea what this has to do with Haiti.  We got a taste here.  We got Kenny attempting the course, and he might have screwed up here.  All right. 
[00:55:00]  We are the world.  We are the children.  We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's start giving.  There's a choice we're making.  It's true.  I fucked it up.  What a dope.  That's one take Kenny. 
[00:55:30]  That's a good old one take Kenny.  Oh, I thought he was talking about everything in life.  I fucked it up.  And then Mustard is part of the song, so we got a little taste of how Mustard is sounding.  Yes, Mustard is the one guy who was trying to sound really good.  Yeah, he's trying.  Yeah.  With the affectation on his voice and the whole deal.  There's a choice we're making.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Saving our own lives.  It's true. 
[00:56:00]  We're making a brighter day.  Just you and me.  We are the world.  We are the world.  We are the children.  We are the ones who make a brighter day.  So let's start giving.  Let's start giving.  There's a choice we're making.  We're saving our own lives.  It's true.  We're making a brighter day.  Just you and me. 
[00:56:30]  It's not bad.  No, it's actually not.  Why do you guys make good faces?  Because I don't like the...  I don't like the...  I grab your lunch out of the dumpster.  Yeah.  The affectation.  Yeah, yeah.  But he actually did sound good there.  Steve Rabatio sounds like he's singing with an anvil on his chest.  There is kind of a...  But you got a good version of Mustard.  He wasn't all fucked up, right?  No, Mustard was sober.  And he's actually very concerned because after Troy explained what happened with his album on the air, 
[00:57:00]  a lot of fans started contacting him and telling him how bad he fucked everything up.  Yeah.  And so he's like...  Oh, shit, yo.  Good, he should.  He's really trying to make an effort.  He says he's not going to bring that guy that he brought with him back and he's going to come in clean.  He was sober when he did that.  I'm still in, man.  I want to help him out and try to get this album out there.  But the first session with Troy was a disaster.  It really was.  And then he comes in for the We Are The World recordings and he was sober and sounded really good. 
[00:57:30]  He was way easier to work for.  I was worried that he wouldn't want to work with all the non-professionals.  I have an idea.  Yeah.  Is it possible?  No.  You're right.  First of all, most artists don't get a chance to be told they're fucking up.  Like, they usually just fuck up and that's it.  At least he's got a chance.  And is there any way, look, we very much wanted to see Grey Wolf.  Yes.  That you could take Mustard and get an extra verse out of him and somehow combine him and 
[00:58:00]  Grey Wolf and perhaps get a fucking song.  That could be something maybe we add to the album.  Two homeless guys singing a song.  But see, the problem is we can't get Grey Wolf to redo what he did.  So we would have to use what Grey Wolf did already.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Because we've already tried to get Grey Wolf to reenact what he did.  And it's just not happening.  You get him to get...  Because that goddamn Grey Wolf song, I'll say it every time.  That thing is...  That's a masterpiece.  It's a minute short of a classic.  Oh, we were so close to a big fucking hit. 
[00:58:30]  That's all right.  You try to maybe get or have him and fucking Mustard do something together and then see  if you can blend it in or just get Mustard.  There's a way to do that where you could probably get something out of it.  Drew Boogie is screaming at his radio right now.  Why?  Because he tried to get some more out of Grey Wolf.  He couldn't get anything out of him.  Well, try again.  He spent a whole day in a studio with the guy.  And what was Grey Wolf not doing?  Just not sounding good?  Or was Mount Teeth in the way?  What happened?  I don't know.  He wasn't sounding right and he kept insisting on playing the flute.  Yeah. 
[00:59:00]  It's just...  Yeah.  It's just nonsense.  Primadonna.  It's just nonsense.  Primadonna homeless guy.  It's a flute slash weapon.  That's why they're homeless, by the way.  Yeah.  They're not good at taking direction and shit like that.  Well, we should rip the flute out of his hand and beat him to death.  Oh, it sounds right.  Sounds right.  Treat yourself.  That's why you step on cakes.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Bud the Trucker.  Exactly.  Bud.  Congratulations, Jimmy.  You're going to make a great father. 
[00:59:30]  This is for mustard.  He's trying to make this piece of shit sound good, but he won't get off the toilet for his own career.  That's true.  Trying to make this piece of shit sound good.  That's true, but it's his own stuff and he falls asleep with a log hanging out like a fucking oxtail.  Yeah, this piece of shit we are the world thing that we'll play like three times and then throw away.  Ah, shit.  You're right.  And this fucking CD could be out there for a real long time to come.  Dash in Syracuse. 
[01:00:00]  Dash.  Oh, yeah.  B-b-b-boys.  Hey, Dash.  Hello.  I got a birthday announcement for you.  Yeah.  Uh, Daniel Benoit was, uh, featured today here on Channel 9 in Syracuse.  No way.  Oh, Mike.  See, that would be Chris Benoit's son.  That is no longer with us.  And he was wished a happy birthday on the local news in Syracuse?  Uh, yeah.  Does anyone have that audio that they could send to us?  Who was wishing him a birthday? 
[01:00:30]  Uh, it was all the crew, basically.  Uh, Sam got in on this one, too.  So, he doesn't have a lot of stuff.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no.  See, that's just fucking...  I'm a piece of shit, but even I am uncomfortable with that.  That is really bad.  We're very uncomfortable with it, but we certainly got to hear how it sounds.  Although, we were fine with Connor Peterson's birthday announcement.  Yeah, it's true.  Because he was never really out of the womb until, you know, after.  He didn't catch a crippled crossface.  Well, there is a reference to the phone cord in there, too, so... 
[01:01:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  How did they get that in?  Oh, we have our ways.  Oh, you're part of it.  Oh, well.  Are you part of it?  All right, Dan.  Maybe.  Possibly.  All right, well, how do we get a copy of this?  You'll send it to somebody?  I just sent it to Steve at FoundryMusic.com.  Yes, we'll have it on in two months.  Yes, you'll be right behind the giant logo.  Who would get the comment of his eyes if you can look at his inbox? 
[01:01:30]  That's funny.  I now own your creativity.  Yes.  This large capital inbox looking just...  Okay, cool.  The inbox, or as I like to call it, my anus.  Yeah.  I'm going to continue sending you messages saying you have a private message on Foundry.  No spam filter will stop me.  All right, Dash.  We'll have that on the air in a few minutes. 
[01:02:00]  Thank you for all you do.  Enjoy.  You sick fucks.  Yes.  Dash in Syracuse.  We'll have to see that one.  That sounds fun.  One more.  We have a lot of these raw tracks from the We Are The World recordings, but we'll play one  more now, and then we'll play a few more later.  Might as well.  We'll break it up.  We'll pepper them through the show.  Yeah, we'll break them up a little bit.  You might know this person from the show.  That's all I'm going to say right now.  We are the world.  We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's give something, a flashlight to something 
[01:02:30]  to make it brighter.  Oh, shit.  Did that make the song?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  But that was also, we're trying to, that's one of the things that we have to work out  in mixing, because Paul Hargis and Chip Chipperson all changed the lyrics during the chorus.  Ah, so that's kind of, you know, everything, so we, they may get actually raised in the mix. 
[01:03:00]  Bring them up in the mix and bring the chorus down a little bit, so you feature these stars.  They ad-libbed a little bit.  I, I, by the way, was laughing my ass off last night at the, uh, the fire hydrant factory.  The dog was, you know, what if you had a fire, fire hydrant factory or something?  Or something.  That's why I wasn't sure.  Fire hydrant factory.  The dog would be happy, you know, right?  Of course he would. 
[01:03:30]  That's why I was laughing so hard, Chip.  Sure.  Unless you made him move.  Something like a castle on a milk bowl or something.  Hey, it's Joe, we're making a holiday.  I thought it was on.  You're a night.  We are the ones.  We are the children.  We are the ones.  Charles, we're making a...  Right.  Fuck, what are you doing?  You're getting annoyed.  Holy shit.  Mustard's starting to... 
[01:04:00]  Maybe it sounds good on the plastered walls of a shelter, but...  Holy fuck.  Jesus, Anthony.  Enough.  Trying to help a guy.  We're the choice.  We're making...  We're saving our lives.  True.  We'll make a better day for you and me.  Fuck.  Stop it.  You're turning the corner on Mustard.  Fuck.  I'm done.  You've had it.  Done.  Put it down.  I'm bringing ketchup.  I've had enough with Mustard.  Why have you had it?  Back to the fucking shelter. 
[01:04:30]  Holy shit.  That affectation.  That affected fucking technique.  He's trying to show people that he's very talented.  Even though it's a shit project he's involved in.  We are the one who made...  We are the one who made a brighter day.  Let's start giving...  Charles, we'll make light.  We're saving our own light.  True.  We'll make a better day.  Just you and me.  Hey! 
[01:05:00]  You're making me uncomfortable.  Oh, I hate it.  What the fuck?  What's wrong with you?  It's mustard.  Find Dunkin' Donuts and get some breakfast.  Show us what we're going to have.  Yeah.  Saving our own lives.  Yeah.  It's true.  We're making a brighter day.  Just you and me.  Bye.  Who's my?  We are the one.  We are the one.  Ah, that way.  We are the children.  We are the ones who make a brighter day.  So let's start giving. 
[01:05:30]  Let's start giving.  There's a choice we're making.  Yeah.  Roof over your head or no roof over your head.  You made the wrong one.  It's true.  We're making a better day.  Just you and me.  Why are you turning on mustard?  That's actually not bad.  Fuck.  Why are you turning on mustard?  I just...  We are the world.  We are the world.  We are the children.  We are the one to make a brighter day. 
[01:06:00]  So let's start giving.  There's a choice we're making.  We're saving our own lives.  That's true.  We're making a brighter day.  Just you and me.  Shit.  Are you saying enough?  Oh.  Back to the gutter.  Back to Skid Row.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Stop it already.  When Ant has had it, he's had it.  Oh, I have had it.  Go fight someone for a heating grate. 
[01:06:30]  You don't even have a hint of a heart.  Oh, God.  Enough.  Just fucking find yourself a sleeping bag, a heating grate in a box.  Hear him inside.  What's coming out of that box?  Sounds coming from a box.  Made the wrong one, didn't you?  Jesus.  What happened?  Right.  He's down on his block.  Fuck. 
[01:07:00]  Oof.  Oh, here he is.  Yeah.  That's the evening house.  It's true when I go out a day.  Just you and me.  Mate.  We are the world.  We are the world.  We are the world.  We are the children.  We are the ones.  We are the ones. </pre>
