<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts and crew engaging in their typical vulgar banter, filled with insults and profanity, amidst technical difficulties with their microphones.  The conversation quickly transitioned to "Whip-em-Out Wednesday," a segment showcasing listeners displaying the show's "WOW" logo on their vehicles, often leading to interactions with women, with Penthouse Club employees mentioned as distributors of stickers.  A discussion about the messy studio couch ensued.  A significant portion of the show was devoted to a live police chase in Newark, New Jersey, which the hosts followed via police scanner, offering running commentary and comparing the police response unfavorably to that in Los Angeles.  They also criticized the news channels' coverage of the chase.  The chase concluded with the suspects apprehended.

Following the police chase, the show featured several caller stories: one recounted a past high-speed chase involving a stolen truck and multiple wrecked police cars; another described a bizarre California chase involving a man setting his truck on fire, displaying a protest banner, and brandishing a shotgun; and a third detailed a chaotic used laptop sale that resulted in injuries and pandemonium.  A skydiving accident with a fatality was also discussed.  The first part of the broadcast concluded with discussions about a potential Howard Stern roast and a review of "Broken Flowers," focusing on a scene featuring an underage-appearing actress in a state of undress.

The next segment began with a discussion of a picture of Alexis Zina Jones and a promised explicit video, followed by the hosts acknowledging it was the show's 202nd live broadcast on XM Satellite Radio.  They mocked a Howard Stern clip about Sirius XM subscriber numbers.  Studio guest Michael McKean joined the show, discussing his career (including *Spinal Tap* and work with Christopher Guest), current projects like *Hopeless Pictures*, anecdotes from his time in the movie and theater industries, and his musical collaborations with David Lander.  The conversation also touched on dealing with negative movie reviews.  The segment continued with Opie’s excessively loud headphone volume, leading to a discussion on earwax removal methods, particularly ear candles, fueled by listener calls. Opie then launched into a graphic account of his mouse extermination efforts in his apartment, which spurred more listener calls sharing their own mouse-catching experiences and further discussion of ear candles.

The following segment opened with Opie's gruesome description of dispatching a mouse caught in a glue trap.  This led to a discussion of ineffective pest control methods and general rodent disgust. The conversation shifted to the hosts' living situations in New York City, including dealing with neighbors and cigarette smoke. Studio guest Adam Ferrera discussed his rodent problems and the instability of comedic employment contracts, mentioning his recent Olive Garden commercial.  The hosts then recounted a story about a man severely mauled by chimpanzees, detailing the graphic injuries.  A phone interview with the victim's wife and her attorney, Gloria Allred, followed.  The segment continued with a discussion of the "Assault on the Media" listener contest, focusing on disrupting local news broadcasts.  Finally, a call from Gavin in England featured audio of a friend engaging in anal sex with a strap-on dildo at a swingers party, sparking further discussion about sexual preferences and experiences among callers.

The next segment started with Opie detailing a near-toilet accident. The conversation then turned to a critical thread on a New York radio message board accusing the show of shifting from "shocking radio" to a political program, similar to Don Imus' career. The hosts defended their show's format, emphasizing its diverse range of topics to fill the four-hour XM slot, contrasting it with shorter commercial radio broadcasts.  They also discussed a recent debate with Marc Maron and the subsequent online backlash. A new bit analyzing fear-mongering tactics in local news teases followed.  A phone interview with baseball analyst Kevin Kennedy followed, covering his new book, baseball-related questions, rumors about Cal Ripken Jr. and Kevin Costner, and Derek Lowe’s affair with a Fox Sports reporter.  The segment concluded with topless women from the Penthouse Executive Club in the studio interacting with the hosts and Kennedy, incorporating suggestive banter and baseball discussion, and touching on steroid use in baseball.

The final segment heavily featured Kevin Kennedy discussing steroid use in baseball, its health consequences (impotence, heart problems), and fan reactions.  He mentioned Jose Canseco's book and appearance on the show, where Canseco's comments on steroid use affecting his sex life were discussed.  The conversation touched upon past baseball scandals. The segment then shifted to unrelated topics, including two dancers visiting the studio, leading to flirtatious banter and discussions of their clothing.  The hosts also mocked an upcoming acting class monologue and discussed OJ Simpson, Scott Peterson, and a recent OJ Simpson interview, speculating on his mindset and public perception. The broadcast ended with random, vulgar, and sexually suggestive remarks from the hosts and a caller.  The presence of a film crew throughout the broadcast was mentioned.

[00:00:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Oh, very nice. 
[00:03:30]  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton, and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelch and I know it.  I'm just a zelch and I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable asshat.  These dummies at work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby. 
[00:04:00]  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the coffee?  He rocks.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  That is...  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you're stinking.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, bring it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  You see that shirt?  I've seen the cops knocking the truck window out.  And I thought they were giving the man UPS.  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was.  That's terrific.  That's terrific. 
[00:05:00]  That's funny.  I'm funny.  Pardon my French.  But you're an asshole.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Bam, bam, bam.  Bam, bam, bam.  Hi.  What's up, Anthony?  Good morning.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Good morning, Yippie. 
[00:05:30]  On this fine whip-em-out Wednesday.  Yes, it is.  I saw a lot of stickers on the way home yesterday.  Down the expressway.  Why are you pointing at your microphone?  I couldn't hear myself.  Well, you're on, moron.  I can't hear me.  But I didn't know.  You see the attitude he gave me?  Excuse me.  Well, I didn't want to yell, hey, this is not on.  It's not on.  Hey, asshole.  Hey.  I was signaling.  Hey, button pusher.  I'm not on.  Oh, boy.  Boy.  Ahem.  Ahem.  Wow, that was a bit of an attitude, I think. 
[00:06:00]  I couldn't try to.  How was I going to say this for no one else?  I didn't shove food in his mouth.  Maybe you should have kept the mic off.  No, I'm hungry.  Full mouth.  Jesus.  All right, everyone's levels are fine, right?  Yeah.  Check.  Check one, two.  Yes, they are.  All right, it's running at a, uh, at a, uh, I'm going to give it a plus four and a half today.  Four and a half?  Four and a half.  You're a madman.  That's for Jimmy.  You, Anthony, I need you up at about, uh, plus six.  I have no idea what it means. 
[00:06:30]  And believe it or not, I'm, um, at plus one.  Ooh.  Well.  It's obvious who's running the controls.  No, plus one is...  I have no idea what that means.  ...is less gooder than your plus six.  It's nothing to me.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  You want to explain this old gag, Anthony?  This old gag goes back to, I believe, it's 1953.  Jimmy distracted me.  You can.  Is it his mouth full of egg white and pointing at the mic? 
[00:07:00]  Disgusting.  You asked if the mic was on, and then you shoved food in your face, so you can't use the mic anyway.  That's all right, but I didn't know if you heard my answer when you said, how are you?  So if I was going to add something, I was like, or at least attempt to, I said, better to have the mics on, because you may have forgotten to hit the button.  That has to be one eggy windscreen on your mic.  Why?  Is it eggy?  No, not at all.  No?  I don't spill like you, ever.  Oh, very neat.  Sorry to even imply that.  Very neat.  My goodness.  I see what Jimmy's defensive about.  So during that, though, I heard you say that you've seen a lot of WOW stickers on the highway. 
[00:07:30]  Yes, and of course, I dangerously pull up close to see if it's an XM one, or if it's one of the old NEW ones.  And a lot of the new XM ones now popping up, noticing that.  And then the truck driver kind of looks, because he thinks I'm checking out the WOW, and I pull up on side, and he thinks it's going to be a chick with tits, and he gets me.  It really is the worst.  Can you guys stop giving us the finger?  Yeah.  We're just excited that you're, you know, promoting the show, so we want to give you a little props. 
[00:08:00]  Sorry, my name's on your truck.  Sorry.  I do it all the time, too.  I pull right up, I beep like a lunatic, I'm waving.  I don't go that far.  And they get all pissed off.  I pull up my cock.  Like, move on, faggot.  I'm like, no, dude, you got my name on your vehicle, and I want to give you props, that's all.  They do look sorely disappointed when you pull up next to them, though.  I just give the little glance, you know?  I don't want to let on to anything.  Give the little glance, and I look, and they're kind of looking at the vehicle, maybe through the tinted window in the back of the girl. 
[00:08:30]  Maybe she's there, but there's no chick.  Right, well, it is Whipping My Wednesday, something we started a long time ago, and it works like a charm.  Yes, it does.  You throw a wow on your vehicle, any way, shape, or form.  You can get the officially sanctioned OVN Anthony bumper sticker, the wow bumper sticker.  Or you can just put it in the dirt in the back of your truck, or write it in duct tape.  I've seen that one.  I've seen a big painted wow on the back.  Whatever it takes, just get a wow on there. 
[00:09:00]  And if a girl is familiar with the program, drives up, sees it, she knows what to do next.  She'll pull up next to you and flash her beautiful breastisies at you.  And it happens every day.  Matter of fact, for this fine Whipping My Wednesday, I think we've got a couple girls from the Penthouse Club coming in.  And I think they're going to walk around like, I don't know, Manhattan, or just a few blocks near the studio and hand out wow stickers and stuff today for us.  Lovely.  And if you're looking for a wow sticker, you can send in a self-addressed stamped envelope.  The address is 111 West 57th Street, New York, New York, 10019. 
[00:09:30]  Just write XM Satellite Radio on the envelope, too, I guess.  And hopefully we'll find your envelope, because today, as I sat down on the couch, the couch that is just cluttered with old newspapers.  I notice you throwing things off of the couch today.  It's a hint.  Every morning, I've been doing it for a week, and no one's catching on yet.  They just pick it up off the floor and put it back on the couch.  Well, you've got to explain.  I mean, I gave up my office, because Ron and Fez are coming in. 
[00:10:00]  Our office, actually.  You gave up on it a while ago.  I gave up on that.  I never go in there.  We had a great idea at the time.  We had our own private little office.  They set up nice computers and phones.  You know, typical little cubicle area, little closet type of office for you and I to maybe have some privacy.  Yeah.  And then we have this big bullpen, this glass-enclosed bullpen.  And it turned out everyone wants to just hang out in there in the morning, which is fine.  And you have your own computer, Ben.  Danny's at one. 
[00:10:30]  Nathaniel's at one.  Steve's at one.  And Jimmy even has his own space.  Right.  No reason to go into the little office.  But I decided that all I need in that area is a couch and a spot on the couch.  And everyone knows that.  But every morning, there's just a pile of crap on the couch.  And I've been nicely moving it every morning for weeks on end.  Yeah.  And I started this week.  I'm like, you know what?  Someone's got to figure this out.  So I just, like, knock everything on the floor every morning.  I've definitely noticed that also. 
[00:11:00]  And I find wow mail all over the place.  There was old newspapers piled up.  And there was, like, wow envelopes in between and stuff.  Sorry.  Got distracted now.  There seems to be a police chase going on in Newark.  And the guy just did a 360 on someone's front lawn and almost got broadsided by the cops.  You rarely see these on the East Coast.  You know?  The cops don't usually chase perps.  In L.A., it's a huge thing.  Out west, you know, you see it all the time. 
[00:11:30]  But here, the cops are usually told to break off the chase because, God forbid, something happens.  You get sued 80 times over.  But this one's good.  It's in Newark, New Jersey, so I'm sure it must be some accountant at the wheel.  It's had a problem.  Yeah.  Not his way to work.  Not his way to work.  I'm certain of it.  Newark.  This chase doesn't seem as exciting as the ones in L.A.  Well, the one, it was good on the front lawn.  Yeah.  That was good.  We got too many trees for good police chases here.  But, see, we're not pussies. 
[00:12:00]  We're not pussies on the East Coast.  When it comes to these police chases, you watch this footage.  Yeah.  The cops are going to start banging into this guy.  They're not going to just follow him until he runs out of gas.  You know?  Well, there's a very limited time that they're allowed to chase these things.  Until the second that people are put in danger, they call the chase off.  Right.  So they've got to really end it quickly.  If it gets a little too much publicity like this one's getting, then they just call it off.  But they've got a helicopter tracking him.  He's doing a pretty good clip down a really wonderful-looking street there in Newark. 
[00:12:30]  We are so obsessed as a society with these chases.  I love it.  It's entertainment.  Now where's he going?  He just made a left-hand turn.  He tried to make a turn.  It looked like he's on an on-ramp.  Yeah.  All right.  Damn, I hate this because it's completely distracting now.  Near a cemetery.  He's flying.  How am I supposed to...  The helicopter's having a tough time keeping up.  Yeah.  How are we supposed to do a show when this guy's being chased?  I don't even remember what we were talking about.  I guess it was wow stickers and a messy couch, right?  Oh, your messy couch. 
[00:13:00]  Whatever.  It's a dumb thing.  But I just knock everything on the floor every morning now.  He's on like a service road.  Is he going the wrong way on that service road?  Doesn't it look like it?  It might not be.  I've noticed, too, my desk, which I don't really, you know, I don't care.  Oh, he's going highway.  He's going highway.  What road is that?  I have no idea, but he's...  Steve, do you understand where this is?  He's working onto the highway.  Oh, Steve needs a mic.  Go ahead, sir.  I think he's... 
[00:13:30]  If he's heading towards Newark Airport, he knows they're not going to be able to follow him,  and it looks like that's where he's going.  To the airport?  I think so.  Who won't be able to follow him?  Helicopter.  Helicopter won't be able to follow him into an airport because they can't go over airport  airspace.  Well, that's interesting.  I think Steve might actually have a point there.  He certainly doesn't think so.  He doesn't think so.  No, they're going to fly right to the Continental Terminal and fucking arrest him.  What is Steve talking about?  I don't know.  That's true.  That's true.  You know this.  You haven't heard that before?  No. 
[00:14:00]  Often in police chases, what they'll do is they'll head to airports because the helicopters...  Is it true that you do that and you run to the airport because the tag on  your ear is beeping and the helicopter follows you to try to shoot a dart in your hair, you  big ass?  If he heads toward Newark Airport, the helicopter will break chase because he's in...  I don't know what the term is.  A helicopter can't even keep airspace?  Restricted airspace.  Thank you, Derek.  He's not going to break chase.  Did you hear him, though?  He said, often.  I've watched a lot of these chases.  I've never seen them end at an airport. 
[00:14:30]  What's happening near airports?  Oh, well, I've got to give up.  Let's just circle here over the house.  It's not going to happen.  You're not a legal eagle.  He was all proud of his airport.  I was proud of mine.  I think I'm right.  The helicopter, you're right, though.  It can't keep up with this or it's having trouble tracking this car.  They're not used to this, I don't think, on the East Coast.  Nah.  The helicopters, anyway.  This is News Copter 7.  It's not a cop.  Yeah, they've got some, you know, big-breasted women up there trying to do traffic reports.  I think they're in a police chase.  Best thing you know is he's holding on for dear life. 
[00:15:00]  Ah!  Slow down!  Right.  You're frightening me.  Well, technically, if they drive by a bus terminal, the guy has to give them 30 seconds head start.  What?  That's extremely accurate, Jimmy.  Thank you so much.  Awful legal advice.  I'm not wrong.  But he's actually not going to the airport.  Oh, he's not?  Well, of course he's not.  He just went to East Orange because now he's going west.  Oh, they just try to focus on the streets on there, but, uh...  Yeah, well, this is...  It might catch up to him now that he's in these side streets.  Damn it.  Yeah, he never went on that highway. 
[00:15:30]  It looked like he was going to.  I hope, uh...  Oh, this is cool.  When it ends, they use the words, hail of gunfire.  Greg, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  I got the police scanner here, if you want to hear what they're saying.  Yeah, let's take a quick listen.  Here, hold on.  Here you go.  Blue Jeep Liberty.  Public, you know, Lima.  Three-seven whiskey.  Nice.  All right, aviation.  Lima, thirty-seven whiskey.  New Japan.  All right, thirty-seven whiskey. 
[00:16:00]  I like that.  All right, I'm passing the charge.  Right by two-eighties.  Oh.  Oh.  All right, nail him.  Oh!  Oh!  He squeezed through two cars at an intersection.  This guy's a, might I say, a maniac.  Yeah.  He's driving like a maniac.  You guys still want to hear it?  Oh, big, big.  Yeah, go, go.  Big, busy intersection.  Oh, he just darted right across it. 
[00:16:30]  No problem.  Yeah.  This is like watching Grand Theft Auto live, man.  These are some wild streets for a chase.  The L.A. chases, it's usually a lot of, uh, a lot of straightaways, highways.  This guy.  Wow.  They have to have the breaking news ID right there, right?  I know.  Put your graphic down, you dopey asses.  It's the news these days.  Better to get the big fucking colorful graphic up there than get the actual, uh, scene.  Oh, that was close.  There you go.  Hit him.  Oh, no. 
[00:17:00]  He missed the truck.  How perfect.  That truck could have taken him out.  Stay right there, Greg.  I'm going to Nebraska for a second.  Keep playing the scanner.  Yeah, Matt, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to pledge to Steve the Jackass.  This doesn't happen often in a police chase where they go into restricted airspace.  He's talking about a shitty Keanu Reeves called Speed.  That's where he's on.  Are you getting your info from Speed?  You're getting your info from movies.  It was either a movie or a news story.  I don't know.  See, this guy has to do 55 miles an hour. 
[00:17:30]  If he slows down, he'll blow up.  It was just like a movie.  Thank you.  Just like a news story.  Did they lose it?  Let's go to Tony in Jersey.  Tony?  Go ahead.  Well, I was just saying the same thing on 21 North.  In the movie, Steve, he takes the bus to the airport so the helicopters cannot follow it.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Check it out.  The helicopter.  Did he lose the car?  The helicopter, like, lost him in some trees.  I spotted him.  There he is.  All right. 
[00:18:00]  We got him back.  Oh, another helicopter.  Another helicopter.  No, he's got to do the job.  Okay, blue.  The good helicopter.  Right.  That guy should be taking Vic Morrow's head off somewhere.  Approaching Nutley now on 28 Northbound.  All right.  He's approaching Nutley, New Jersey.  All right.  And we've got a wow sticker.  How about the historical media?  Don't let him get to the airport.  Don't let him get to the airport.  Steve says we won't be able to chase him. 
[00:18:30]  What a complete ass.  Over.  I hope he goes to the airport and these helicopters can't follow him.  KDK-12 to KDK-1.  What's going on?  He's pulling off the little highway thing there and going back into another neighborhood.  Come on.  End this.  The graphic.  They won't move it.  Back on the side streets, yeah.  They don't know how to remove the graphic.  Move your stupid graphic.  Oh, gosh.  Can't they just put a dump truck up?  Fucking let him hit us? 
[00:19:00]  Greg.  All right.  What's your location?  That's for the strong-arm robbery, right?  What's your location?  Strong-arm robbery.  Is that what?  What do you possibly steal at 6 in the morning by force?  How is he even awake?  I thought they slept until noon.  Oh, my God.  What?  Criminals?  Yeah.  They're in a town.  Stay by.  Maybe you've got the only laptop.  Hit him.  Get into that story in a little bit.  No.  All right.  Some of these citizens have to get into it.  Yeah, man.  That car doesn't look that important. 
[00:19:30]  Knock into him.  Just hit him.  There's another cop.  Could have hit him.  Oh, they might get him boxed in.  There he goes.  There's a fucking graphic.  A helicopter lost him.  A helicopter lost him.  Go down.  No, it's not over there.  You idiot.  Oh, my God.  The helicopter guy's freaking out.  They just lost him.  He's over the top.  You idiot.  How do you lose a guy from the air?  Fucking rookies in the air here in New York.  Oh, man.  For the rest of the country, we're watching this on Channel 7 here in New York, and the  guy is just panicking.  The cameraman is panicking. 
[00:20:00]  California's got to be laughing.  He can't figure out where it is.  Oh, what a douche.  Oh, that guy is so fired.  He's not just fired.  He's so fired.  They got him.  They got him.  No, that's a shitty helicopter view.  The one helicopter lost him, so they went to the other helicopter view.  They're going to miss the big crash.  These guys are awful.  Of course.  LA's got to just laugh at these people.  Yeah, they're terrible.  All right.  Hey, we're on 21.  Are you?  You're on 21 right now.  I'm amazed that they're... 
[00:20:30]  Oh, he's going up the wrong way on a one-way.  Well, that's going to get him a violation.  That's a ticket.  Right across an intersection without even slowing down.  And still down a one-way street.  New York is going this long with this.  I know.  Where are you?  Oh, back out onto a main road.  And the graphics in the fucking way.  Move the graphics.  God, they suck.  Channel 7, you stink.  All right.  Five?  Channel 5 is carrying it? 
[00:21:00]  Go to Fox 5.  Fucking...  Well, keep...  Keep...  Oh, wow.  Everyone's going with it here in New York.  Yeah, this is all big special.  What a way to start our show.  It's a major distraction.  Yeah, can we go...  Look at Fox, how beautiful Fox is.  Look at that shitty ABC.  Little small graphic in the corner.  Give me Fox.  Go to Fox over here, too.  Oh, ABC stinks.  Just stinks.  Just lost you, Channel 7.  Fucking...  New York.  Good job.  Job well done.  Good day, sir.  Where are you going?  He's in a park.  He's in the rear of the building there.  He pulled into the rear of the lot there, the Colonnade building. 
[00:21:30]  Are you kidding me?  We got a unit behind him.  Behind the Colonnade.  Get the helicopter over there, you...  Are you...  This helicopter...  Channel 7.  8?  What?  7.  7.  Go to 7.  Quick.  He just pointed a weapon.  Pointed a weapon.  Shoot him.  Shoot him.  3-5-1 Broad Street.  3-5-1 Broad Street.  It's the same...  It's the same...  It's the same angle.  Hey, guys, this is Greg from Bloomfield.  You still want to hear it?  Yes, you idiot!  Pulled out a gun!  Pulled out a gun!  You brown!  Our listeners are retarded! 
[00:22:00]  Put back Fox.  What are you doing?  This stinks.  The same graphic.  In case you shoot, we'd hate to see it.  West on Crane Street.  In North.  Now, Fox has the stupid...  No, go to...  Channel 7 on that one.  Channel 5 over here.  Yeah.  Give us a couple options.  God damn it.  You're almost there?  Wait, he's back in the car?  He's back on the road.  Why is Channel 5 just showing a highway?  He stopped over the Colonnade.  Channel 5's in the parking lot.  Channel 5's still in the parking lot.  Channel 7's chasing... 
[00:22:30]  Channel 7's chasing some soccer mom.  This guy's at the Colonnade having brunch.  No!  What did you do?  No!  What did you do?  What did you do?  What did you do on MTV?  Jesus Christ!  Turn it off!  Oh, he's running.  He's running.  Oh, please shoot him.  He's under the trees.  Oh, well, no.  Damn it.  He gets up in there.  Then I'm going to catch him.  Well, let's listen to the police scanner.  Greg, if you hang up now, we'll come...  We'll punch you down.  Oh. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, two pursuits.  They had him.  Where did they go?  They showed him running. 
[00:23:30]  Now they're showing the empty vehicle.  Oh, one...  Oh, kick him!  Oh, kick him!  Kick him!  Kick him!  Nice.  Nice good kick to the side.  Kick him in the head.  Look at the graphic.  The fucking ABC should be firebombed.  They stink.  Now they...  Now they move it.  The thing is over, and they finally removed it.  Yeah.  You stupid sons of bitches.  Where's the other guy?  Holy shit.  They had to keep the graphic there.  Both suspects in custody in Newark.  Both in custody. 
[00:24:00]  Now we can do a show.  Aw.  Pull him up by his dreads.  Look at that.  That was really cool, man.  That was really cool.  Good one.  ABC, what a fucking despicable channel.  ABC, horrid job.  Hey, Greg.  Doing that chase.  Greg?  Right.  They're over here in Newark.  All right.  That's it.  That's it with the police scanner? 
[00:24:30]  We're not going to hear anything else.  What an idiot.  We have a weapon.  And he says, what?  You guys still want to hear this?  No.  No, of course not.  All right.  Greg?  Greg?  I'm not sure if this is the second pursuit you were talking about.  We have two suspects in custody.  Right by the front part.  Yeah.  What's up, guys?  Greg, great job.  Great job.  Great pickup.  I was thinking about the police scanner for us.  Oh, no problem.  Anytime. 
[00:25:00]  It really helped us a bit.  Yeah.  I live right by the chase, so I had a couple of wild stickers that jump right in front of the car.  All right.  Thank you, Greg.  All right.  No problem.  See you.  All right.  Bye.  That was awesome.  Yeah, it was a good one.  This guy was involved in a police chase in 96.  J.R. from West Virginia.  J.R.  Hey, how's it going, boys?  What's up, J.R.?  Not much.  I'd just like to let you all in on a little story.  All right.  Back in 95, 96, me and a buddy of mine got really drunk and stole a state road truck, an 
[00:25:30]  old 86 S10, took it through West Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio, and when we got back into  Kentucky, we had ended up wrecking about six to seven cop cars, and my buddy was driving  in, and he decided to do the Dukes of Hazzard thing and go through the median about the time  that another three or four cop cars came up through her, and we took all three of them 
[00:26:00]  out with us.  They ended up flipping like four times in the air, and when we woke up, we had nine millimeters  pointing at our heads.  They pulled us out and beat the crap out of us.  And how long did you spend in jail, sir?  About two and a half months.  That's it?  That's it, because we were underage.  Oh, well, it's almost worth it.  We were only like 16 years old, so I mean...  It's almost worth it, right?  It's almost worth it. 
[00:26:30]  You get to do some Dukes of Hazzard moves and stuff?  You might get away.  All right, J.R.  They just wanted to go through the median and see how it felt, I guess.  I don't know.  We were drinking pretty heavy at night, too, so...  All right.  Thank you, J.R.  All right, you'd be cool.  All right, cool.  Let's say hi to Joe from Whack Bag.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  I wanted to nominate something Jim said as the line of the day.  Yeah, I think you guys missed it, but Anthony said something about the guys under the trees,  and then Norm was like, well, if he gets up there, they'll never catch him. 
[00:27:00]  I laughed for about five minutes.  That is horrible.  That really is, sir.  Awful human.  Thanks, Joe.  Thanks, fella.  Let's go to the Night Stalker in California.  Night Stalker.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Morning.  Hey, Jimmy.  Happy birthday.  Hey, thanks, man.  Hey, here's the deal.  Me and a buddy of mine just got off work.  We're sitting in the living room, drinking a couple beers.  Our kids are watching TV, watch cartoons.  All of a sudden, they cut in with his car chase. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  He just got himself on a clover leap on the interchange.  Cops are back maybe, I don't know, 50 yards, 100 yards, something like that.  Uh-huh.  In his truck.  All of a sudden, as it turns out, he had a propane tank in front.  He opens the valve on it.  He lights it.  Big old fireball comes out.  This dude comes fucking flying out of his car, rolls on the ground, puts himself out.  You can see he's all burned up and shit.  Well, he walks over to the side of the clover leap and looks like he's going to jump down maybe, 
[00:28:00]  I don't know, 40, 50 feet to the freeway below him.  And he kind of, I don't know, fucking wanders around there and he unrolls his banner.  He pulls out of the back of his truck.  It's like, fuck HMOs or some shit like that.  But anyway, wandering around, he goes back and he gets a shotgun out of the back of his truck.  And he's standing there with it.  The cops all pull their guns.  They're standing there looking at him.  He stinks and I don't like him.  Oh, Albee, you've been away from this conversation? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, I was trying to find something.  Yeah, um, uh, Night Stalker, why don't you start over again?  No!  Why, you need some gem shit.  I'm not that stupid, I know it's boring, I can tell that much.  Oh, wait a minute, I can't hear, we're having trouble with your phone line.  Uh, call back.  Ugh.  God.  That makes an action-packed police chase with fire and everything else sound like drudgery.  Sound like doing the laundry.  You stunk.  All right, well, there you have it. 
[00:29:00]  That's how we start today's program on this fine.  Whip him out Wednesday.  Nice distracting car chase.  Couple of people, well, one guy who posted eight times.  Uh, what's his name, from Boston?  He's angry because it's not a national story and he couldn't see it.  Sonny, bitch sucked, it wasn't on national TV.  Sonny from Boston.  You know what?  Sonny, I'm banning you.  No, you can't ban him.  I would ban him.  I'm banning him from instant feedback. 
[00:29:30]  He's a little frustrated.  Don't ban him.  Don't ban him.  Don't ban him.  Let me see.  Ban this IP.  No, he's a faithful listener.  Sonny from the show.  No, don't ban him.  All right.  One more chance.  He's just a little frustrated, that's all.  I don't blame him.  But I think there were some funny lines in there, no matter what.  Especially with the helicopter, just panicking.  All of a sudden, he lost the guy.  Everyone is watching in New York.  And all of a sudden, you see the cameraman's view.  He's just searching the trees and he's just panning left, right, up and down, like, 
[00:30:00]  herky-jerky like Ben's running the camera.  Couldn't find the guy.  And you could just feel the panic.  The suspects are out of the car.  Then you hit, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  The camera point up.  Fucking clouds.  All right.  All Access has a little story about the pests.  They do.  Remember yesterday we were talking about the billboard?  Mm-hmm.  This is great.  Our faithful listeners, our pests, fans of this fine radio program,  took it upon themselves to buy a billboard. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Now, that's a fan.  I was going to say they bought a billboard for the show,  but I think they actually bought the billboard for themselves, the O&A Army.  Yep.  And we suggested that they should contact the local media and contact the radio media,  and they did just that, and they got a little press today, Anthony.  Yeah.  All Access.com reporting yesterday.  The snipping between XM Satellite Radio's Opie and Anthony and WTKS Real Radio 104.1 Orlando. 
[00:31:00]  Afternoon host Jim Phillips escalates with the purchase by O&A fans of a billboard in Maitland, Florida,  near the WTKS studios.  The show's dispute started with accusations by O&A that Phillips stole material from them,  excuse me, then led to O&A pest flooding Phillips' show with calls and emails.  The board reads, this is the billboard, Mr. Phillips, the pests win, you lose, good day, sir, the Opie and Anthony Army.  The fans involved, going by the names Chuck E. Arla, Dugout Doug, Boston Strangler, and Norfocal. 
[00:31:30]  Uh-oh, they're getting recognition.  Norfcal.  Yeah.  Norfcal, I guess, N-O-R-F-C-A-L, claim no formal affiliation with the show other than being fans.  Yeah.  So now the pests are getting their own press.  They're getting the press.  But that's pretty cool.  The billboard is up on opiumethity.com if you want to check that out.  They took it upon themselves to purchase this billboard, and it's just sitting there in Orlando 
[00:32:00]  just mocking Jim Phillips who thought he was the real deal, and it turns out he's just a one-market phony.  I don't appreciate this.  Well, what happened?  Now, Mike, Ant, why are you so eager to ban people?  Mike from Ohio?  Take this.  I'm banning you.  You can't ban Mike.  I'm banning Mike from Ohio.  I ban you.  You know, there are times people talk bad about us, but you've got to accept that. 
[00:32:30]  It's the nature of this show, Anthony.  I was reading negative posts about myself last night on whackbag.com.  I'm going to ban him.  You can't ban him.  All right.  I'll give him a shot.  I won't ban him.  Everyone understands this isn't one of these shows where we just want everyone to kiss  our ass.  Certainly do.  Sometimes there's going to be some negative posts, and you're going to have to just deal  with it for a little while.  Don't ban the guy.  I was reading the message boards last night and saw a couple, yeah.  There were a couple that said they didn't like Opie's laugh was one of them. 
[00:33:00]  That's the whole purpose of it.  They don't like Jimmy's politics.  Who cares?  And I don't know.  I don't read any about me.  I just scan right through those.  I'm amazed that we actually have fans out there that don't get the basics of some of  the stuff we do.  Like, my over-the-top laugh is supposed to annoy the shit out of everybody.  Not just the person I'm doing it to, but it's supposed to annoy Anthony, Jimmy, you  listening at home.  And if it blows out your speaker, that makes me very, very happy when I go home. 
[00:33:30]  That's the purpose of that obnoxious laugh.  Yeah, I saw the headline.  Danny, stop it.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Uh, Animal Planet reporting a chimp attack survivor returns home.  I guess this is the guy that got his testicles ripped off.  Oh, this is the guy who's in this story.  Yeah, it was a while ago.  A couple months ago.  Look, he's lost his fingers.  Oh.  You know, if you don't have fingers, testicles, and an eyeball.  Yeah.  And a nose.  It better be because you're saving a busload of children from a bomb and it went off it. 
[00:34:00]  Not a chimpanzee attacked you.  How did a chimp get a hold of him?  Uh, he was, uh, at some kind of, um, chimp, uh, refuge, I believe.  He had owned a chimp previously.  And, uh, I just see you chomping at the bit here.  He had owned a chimp previously.  And, uh, uh, he had to give it to this refuge because it was getting a little rambunctious.  So him and his wife went to go visit the chimp at the refuge and, uh, uh, they went to bring 
[00:34:30]  a cake to, uh, the chimp and, uh, another chimp attacked the guy and started biting his thumb  off.  And, uh, then it just went wild on him.  It ripped his balls off?  It ripped his testicles off.  It bit his balls off and ate his face.  It bit his balls off?  It bit his balls off and ate his face.  Because in the wild, you know, that's what they do.  They don't dance around with a little organ grinder.  You know, they don't have the little cup looking for change, things like that.  They don't wear little caddy suits like in, uh, the little rascals. 
[00:35:00]  In the wild, they chew each other's balls off when they feel threatened.  I thought you were going to say in the wild, the ball bag is a delicacy.  Yes.  That too, Opie.  That too.  All right, let's, uh...  That's great.  Let's move on to Tim in Pennsylvania.  Bit his balls and then his fat face.  Yeah.  Zero.  Can't you fight this thing off?  It's biting your balls.  How do you let it then mosey on up to your face?  You know how strong chimpanzees are?  Probably pretty.  Very powerful little animals.  That's what you get. 
[00:35:30]  When a monkey wants cake, fucking give him the cake.  I don't give the monkey the cake.  Trying to scold the chimp and teach it a lesson?  Wait, I haven't lit the candles.  This isn't for you.  Well, give me those balls, sir.  I'll have those instead.  Good for him.  That is horrible.  Stay off the refuge, stupid.  Are we getting this audio?  Because it's a big story today on the news.  They really are going long with the chimp attack survivor returning home.  And then he just kept yelling, my fucking balls, my fucking balls, my fucking balls.  Tim, what's going on? 
[00:36:00]  Hey, fellas.  Hey, Tim.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I'm 36 years old.  And when I was 33, 2003, I had a massive heart attack.  Did you?  Not overweight or anything.  Thank you.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  I'm not overweight or anything.  It's pretty much, it turns out to be family history.  Okay.  But I didn't even feel like I was, I didn't even know what was happening. 
[00:36:30]  I felt like I was being beaten with baseball bats over my entire body.  Where did this story come from?  I don't know.  It's like left field.  I know Jimmy's been concerned about his health problems.  And last week, I didn't, like, feel myself.  So I went to the doctor.  And they did ran all these blood tests and everything else.  And everything came back fine. 
[00:37:00]  Well, finally, they did a nuclear stress test on me.  Where they inject you with this nuclear fluid or whatever.  Nuclear.  It's nuclear.  Don't say it like George Bush.  Nuclear.  All right.  Nuclear fluid.  They injected you with nuclear fluid.  And?  And they take pictures of your heart.  Then make you work out.  They inject you again.  And then they take more pictures.  And they can read that.  Well, they found that my stint from 2003 was closing.  My own scar tissue was closing it back up. 
[00:37:30]  So that could have killed me.  What are you getting at?  What are you?  Why did you call with this?  This is why I went to.  Hold on.  This is why I went to the phone call.  It was very easy.  It says, want to scare Jim with health story.  Meaning you had something that might relate to Jim.  Relate to Jim.  Yeah.  I did.  I went for a stress test.  I'm fine.  I'm bailing on that.  And I'm banning him.  I can't ban him on the phone.  Yeah, you can't.  You know what might happen.  Oh, is he trying to be a new character?  Off-topic guy? 
[00:38:00]  I don't know, man.  From Ty in Jersey.  He's wrecking our buzz here.  Sean in Jersey, what's up?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey, Sean.  Yeah.  Ant, you were talking earlier about the chimp attack, quote-unquote.  Were there quite a few chimps?  Oh, gee.  You're being real subtle, my friend, with your awfulness.  I'm not even going to continue with your call.  Did it happen to Richmond by chance?  Oh, my God. 
[00:38:30]  You know, we are doomed as a nation.  There were white people fighting for the laptops, too.  Of course there were.  White trash.  Huh?  How do you know what he meant?  That's a lot stupid.  I've been on this planet a few years.  I know where people's heads are at.  I had no idea.  That's the beauty of me.  Horrible.  We're doomed as a nation.  There were some white people trying to get those laptops as well.  We will never get along.  Here's a picture of it, Opie.  Study that photo.  Well, here.  Here, this guy's white.  Right.  And that guy's white.  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  And, oh, well, that's the guy that opened the door, so he doesn't count.  One.  I see.  Oh, that guy's white.  Where?  Over here.  This cluster of people is white.  These three people.  The people with the badges and hats?  No.  Oh.  These three people are white.  The people with their shoes and their faces as they lay there being trampled.  All right.  What the hell is this story, by the way?  Because the e-mails were flying back and forth last night.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm getting e-mails on my BlackBerry like crazy.  Well, it appears that they had a sale on Apple laptops. 
[00:39:30]  These things were five-year-old laptops that I guess the schools were selling, upgrading  their systems, and the schools were selling these laptops for 50 bucks a piece.  But they're five years old, these things.  Well, the demand for these things, a little more than anticipated.  And when they flung the gates open to this place, some racetrack that they were going  to sell these laptops at when they flung the gates open, pandemonium, Opie, pandemonium. 
[00:40:00]  They stampeded one woman before the gates opened, didn't want to lose her place online, and  pissed her own pants, just stood there and wet herself as to not lose her place online.  Another guy who brought a lounge chair with him picked up his lounge chair and just started  swinging and beating people with it.  And he later said it was because he had gotten there first online and felt he was entitled  to be there first ahead of the stampeding people. 
[00:40:30]  So he just started swinging his lounge chair around.  There were a lot of injuries.  The police that were there had to call back up.  And some people got very injured.  Here's how it was reported on the news.  Very injured.  A scary scene this morning in Virginia when what began as a laptop sale quickly turned  dangerously chaotic.  Thousands of people pushed and stampeded their way through the gates at Richmond International  Raceway in a rush to buy iBook laptop computers for $50 each. 
[00:41:00]  The Henrico County School District had only about a thousand of these surplus computers  to sell.  And Henrico County residents got first dibs.  Well, none of the injuries appeared to be serious.  But I'll tell you what, this was seriously scary.  I guess a stroller was crushed there.  An elderly man was pushed to the ground.  It was very frightening for the people there.  And worse of all, he said, reportedly, the line in this was so long and people were so  intent on getting these notebook computers. 
[00:41:30]  One woman reportedly wet her pants because she didn't want to lose his clothes in line by  going to the back.  Well, look at those pictures.  See people crying?  It's crazy.  Yeah, that's pathetic.  I don't know.  Witnesses likened it to the running of the bulls.  Yeah.  Screams filled the air and police called for backup as people were trampled, beaten with a  folding chair, like Ann said, and nearly driven over.  I like some of the quotes we have from LaToya Jones.  I could not move.  I could not breathe. 
[00:42:00]  She lost a flip-flop and had to limp around on sizzling blacktop with one bare foot.  This is total, total chaos.  And then 33-year-old Blandine Alexander said the woman in front of her, right in front of  her, was pissing herself as to stay online.  And somebody couldn't believe it, said they don't understand why people were freaking out  over four-year-old, four-year-old Apple iBooks that originally went for $999, up to $1,300 
[00:42:30]  for $50.  And it's a, you know, it's an old machine, four years.  I imagine they're poor and they don't have money.  This is probably the only shot a lot of them allowed to have a laptop for their...  You're stereotyping now.  Now you're being stereotyped.  Anybody that would get into a mob scene to get a four-year-old laptop is probably not  the, you know...  They have one of these stories every year.  Usually it involves the fat brides trying to get the cheap wedding gowns.  And they'd, you know, tackle each other and... 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Start a stampede.  Yeah.  All right.  Another big story that hit the news, Anthony.  I just want to play it, okay?  Yeah.  An horrific skydiving accident when a mob dies in front of her entire family.  Evangston, Wyoming, family and friends watched helplessly.  She was just as bubbly and happy as she could be.  And she ran, almost ran to the airplane to get on it.  This mob was jumping in tandem with her instructor, but as she came closer to the ground, a gust 
[00:43:30]  of wind collapsed the parachute.  She died as her parents, husband and two children watched in horror.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh.  That is...  Oh.  You absolutely should not be doing these skydiving things.  Oh, why?  Especially the tandem.  The only reason the guy is alive is because she was strapped to the front of him.  That's it.  Yeah. 
[00:44:00]  The chute collapsed.  She fell forward first.  He lands on top of her.  It's nice.  Thank you for cushioning my fall.  How high were they, though, if he lived?  I mean...  Probably not all that high.  High enough to kill her, though.  They said as it got closer to the ground, the chute collapsed.  And he apparently fell on top of her.  When asked for comment, the husband was running around, blowing kisses at God, yelling, yippee-yay.  I had my ex-tandem jump in the Bahamas. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, no.  Turks and Caicos.  Turks and Caicos.  Remember that?  Yeah.  I was standing on the beach looking up.  I remember you and I were talking on the beach as she was coming down, and you were praying that the chute wouldn't open.  I was like, oh, here it goes.  Is that a chute?  I saw it in your eyes.  I yelled out, shoot.  And they're like, yeah, it opened.  I'm like, no.  Shoot.  Oh, God.  I remember that day.  You were like, ah, darn.  Hey, it's Ken in Jersey, everybody. 
[00:45:00]  Ken?  Yeah, I got a news tease.  All right.  People flying from the skies.  Do you live near Air Force?  Could you be in danger?  Stay tuned.  News at 11.  Hey!  That was awful.  The callers are atrocious this morning.  So far, right?  Horrid.  You guys suck.  All right.  Let's go to Carl in Queens.  Carl, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Owen A?  Hey, Carl.  I was just listening to Stern, flipping through the channels. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, thanks for the support.  We appreciate it.  No, no, no, no.  I was listening to you guys.  He was talking about doing a roast.  And they were talking about guys that would come on to roast him.  And they were mentioning Dice and Man Cow.  And your name came up, Opie and Anthony.  So I was wondering if you guys would go and roast his big nose asshole.  Why would we do that?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Why would we do that?  I thought it would be pretty funny.  Yeah.  No, we have other plans for Mr. Stern. 
[00:46:00]  As he says goodbye to commercial radio.  That's good.  I picked something.  Thank you, Carl.  Don't other people plan roasts for the person?  You don't plan your own roast, do you?  All right.  Andy, Jersey, what's up?  Hey.  Good.  Hold on.  I'm just wishing that seltzer right now was scalding tea.  So what?  Yeah.  You got me.  I always get myself. 
[00:46:30]  That's never not funny when your friend opens a carbonated beverage and it goes all over the place.  All over.  Andy, what's up?  Hey, guys.  It's Andy from Jersey.  Listen.  Ooh, Howard was on the radio saying he invented the roast.  Now, you guys wouldn't have the balls to come on the show with him and Pat Cooper.  We wouldn't have the balls to come on his show?  Is that what's happening now?  He's such a fucking loser.  I'm not sure what you mean with him and Pat Cooper.  No, he said you guys and Pat Cooper wouldn't have the balls to come on the show.  Oh.  We have other plans for Stern, and we'll do it our way. 
[00:47:00]  We're not going to play his game.  We play our game always.  Well, I just want to say I'm a big fan.  I hope you guys fuck him really good.  You have no idea what we have planned.  Thanks, Andy.  All right, no problem, guys.  All right.  Bye.  We've got secret missions all over the place these days.  Eric in Florida.  What's up, Eric?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Little Jimmy, my idol.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Not dry off.  Relax, dude.  I think it's all dry.  You'll be okay. 
[00:47:30]  Wimps and moisture contains bacteria.  You'll be all right.  I can't.  I'm kind of bummed, actually.  I was really digging the whole germaphobe thing with you until we interviewed Howie Mandel,  and I'm like, ah, man's just a regular guy.  I just don't like gross things.  You know, Howie's one of those poof.  I saw him on the advertisements for Celebrity Poker Tour.  They got that Celebrity Poker thing that goes on?  Yeah.  And they show him wearing these white gloves all the way up to, like, mid-forearm. 
[00:48:00]  And he's, you know, playing poker, but obviously he doesn't want to touch those filthy, dirty  chips and the cards.  Yuck.  Other people are touching them.  It just ruined the bit, though, because we thought we were onto something with you, and  then seeing Howie just, he wouldn't even touch the door to come in and out of the studio.  No, someone else had to open it up.  And then he, like, strategically went out the door, like, sideways.  It was really...  Yeah, didn't want to touch anything.  It was really interesting to take a look at. 
[00:48:30]  Very inconvenient lifestyle.  No, I'm a little kooky, but not like that.  Eric in Florida.  Eric?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, I wanted to know if I could find out where that sign was.  I called one of the local news media outlets.  Yeah.  And I told them if I can get a location.  They said they might go down and check it out and put it on TV.  The billboard in O-Town?  Yes.  You can either go to opianthony.com.  I think there's info up there.  Or go to whackbag.com.  Okay.  And I also want to make a joke about that monkey.  I think if the guy would have given him his gold watch, he'd probably still have his balls. 
[00:49:00]  And he tries a pat from Munaki.  Didn't work, sir.  All right, let's see how to do it.  Never try a joke after saying, I want to try a joke.  Just fucking do it.  I want to try out some...  What is he?  Like a hip comic?  I want to try out some new material tonight.  This next piece is called...  It's written down on a pad sitting on a stool next to him.  What do you got?  It's a stupid movie again.  Can Bill Murray do anything that doesn't suck lately?  What a bore he's turning into. 
[00:49:30]  Well, I might be wrong about this movie, I'm starting to think.  Wait, you saw it, though.  I saw Broken Flowers.  How could you see a movie, say it sucks, and then say you might be wrong about it?  It's one of those movies a couple days later, you start thinking about it, and I'm starting to think.  You're starting to think.  Give that up immediately.  It's kind of...  It might have some intelligence to it.  Oh.  You might have to think about the movie after you leave the theater.  I don't like those.  Kind of like other movies I've seen in the past.  Like any?  Like that Crash movie.  Oh, Crash. 
[00:50:00]  Very thought-provoking after you leave the theater.  But Broken Flowers is another Bill Murray movie.  His latest thing is to, I don't know, sit around for an hour and a half on screen and barely move and barely talk, and everyone is calling him brilliant.  A genius.  I don't get that.  Like, I like Lost in Translation, because I thought the filming of it was spectacular.  Oh.  Is that why you like it?  What is it called?  The cinematologic?  Cinematologic?  Cinematology was great. 
[00:50:30]  Cinematography.  Yeah, cinematography was great, you know, but he barely acted and barely moved, and, you know...  Scarlett Johansson was...  And he's doing the same thing in this Broken Flowers.  Big thing in that movie.  And basically, it's a movie where he's trying to find this son that he might have, so he's going back and visiting with four or five girls he used to go out with.  Mm-hmm.  And the reason you should see the movie is he goes to see Sharon Stone. 
[00:51:00]  He used to go out with Sharon Stone.  Yeah.  Sharon Stone's not home, and this little girl is.  She's 15 years old, I guess, or 16 in the movie.  Mm-hmm.  And she has a little pink bathrobe on, and she's chewing gum, and she's got the big, you know, hoop earrings and stuff.  Looking very hot for her age.  Jeez.  You're a pervert.  I guarantee, you know what?  If you see this, Anthony, you'll be right with me, and so would everyone else out there.  Want to get Opie up on pervertedjustice.com?  Who's seen Broken Flowers? 
[00:51:30]  Help me out with this.  Broken Flowers?  Is that alluding to that whole thing?  I don't know.  So, you know, he's waiting for Sharon Stone to come home, and so we can kind of quiz her and figure out if this son that's supposedly trying to find him is hers.  Uh-huh.  You know, because I guess this kid left home to go find his father.  Yeah.  So the girl's there, like, well, why don't you sit in the room there and wait for my mom, whatever, and she's a typical teenage girl.  She's on her cell phone and stuff, right, and she's got a bathrobe, and she leaves the room, and she comes back in the room on the cell phone completely naked. 
[00:52:00]  What?  Where the whole theater, you could almost hear the whole theater just go.  Oh, wow.  And I'm thinking, how the hell did they get away with that?  Because she's obviously playing a girl that's definitely not out of high school and possibly maybe in 10th grade around there. 
[00:52:30]  She's got to be over 18.  Oh, she's got to be over 18, right?  Yeah.  Completely nude.  What's the...  By the way, sporting a muff.  Really?  Which might bring the muff back now, I'm thinking.  You're thinking that's going to be a new fashion statement?  Sometimes it just takes one lousy thing and a trend is started.  Good old JFK decided not to wear a hat one day, and everyone else decided that hats were out.  If you look at the old footage before, like, 1960...  They wore the wacky inauguration hats.  Every guy over 30 wore some wacky press hat, like he was a writer for... 
[00:53:00]  What's that chick's name in the movie?  I don't know.  Eric decided to, you know, sleep in today, so...  Is it Sherry?  Born in 1969?  Uh...  Oh, wow.  No.  Born July 8th, 1984.  She's 21.  What's her name?  Uh...  Alexis...  D-Z...  Lolita...  Lolita in the movie?  Yeah, exactly.  They gave her the name Lolita, too, so it was like...  You knew what was going on there.  D-Z-I-E-N-A. 
[00:53:30]  Hmm.  And I'm sure the picture's not up yet of her...  You don't think it's on Mr. Skin?  Does Mr. Skin have it?  Go to Mr. Skin, bro.  And see if Mr. Skin has the photo yet.  It is ridiculous, Anthony, to be honest with you.  It's ridiculous.  And then later on, Sharon Stone...  You see it?  No.  What?  No, I just saw one picture, but...  Oh.  The face you made, it was like you saw the picture.  And then later on in the movie, Sharon Stone comes home, and blah, blah happens, and then  he's leaving that house, and she's just waving goodbye to this young... 
[00:54:00]  You know, she's playing a teenager, and just tiny little panties, brawn panties.  But now I'm thinking that Broken Flowers might be a good movie after all.  The critics are giving it rave reviews.  Can you find it?  I'm working.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Flowers.  All right.  Broken Flowers.  Alexa.  Oh, man.  We're doing a live show. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, Eric's here.  Hey, Eric.  See her naked.  Picked a great date over to sleep.  Where have you been?  You over slept.  Supposed to see her naked, but where is she?  What time did you get here?  Dude, he's not even awake.  Look at his eyes.  It says clip available soon.  Soon.  Okay.  I'm telling you, it's going to be a clip that a lot of people are going to be downloading.  This thing is going to be downloaded like crazy.  I think it's going to be one of the biggest downloads for Mr. Skin in recent memory. 
[00:55:00]  Her skintistics, white, has shown bush, brunette, medium breast, average size body.  She's from Long Island, New York.  How about that?  There you have it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Okay.  Anyway.  We're slowing down here a little bit.  Bill, Jersey, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Happy birthday, Jeremy.  Thank you, man.  Yo, Monday, you guys never got to the NEW clips, your last show. 
[00:55:30]  I know.  It's just worked.  Yeah.  Just wanted to forget to get back to that.  You think it's worth playing today?  A little bit of it, yeah, sure.  All right.  You guys sounded like freshly neutered dogs on that show.  You had no idea what to do.  You know what?  It's not a bad idea.  We'll play it after the break, okay?  Sweet.  Thanks, guys.  By the way, just in case anyone is keeping track, today is the 202nd live show for the  Opie and Anthony program.  How do you know that?  This is the 202nd live show on 202. 
[00:56:00]  I'm Rain Man.  Do you have some kind of data you get from ELO, or you just know this off the top of  your head?  No, I keep track.  Like a prisoner.  I just, like, every time we do a live show, I just make a little mark near my computer,  and we're up to 202.  This is the 202nd live show we've done for XM Satellite Radio.  Well, everyone's distracted. 
[00:56:30]  How about we take a break, try to find this picture?  Maybe someone will send it to us, and then, and that's that.  We'll continue after this, all right?  We got this Howard Stern thing we got to play again.  It's very, very funny.  This is from Matt, right, from South Jersey.  Threw this together.  What you're about to hear is Howard Stern lying through his teeth.  He's lying again.  He's doing this to pump up the company he's going to and try to make it seem bigger and  better than it really is.  I'm ready to change radio.  I haven't saved my money yet, so I'm going to go with you, Ty. 
[00:57:00]  Good.  I'm ready to do it once again.  I'm ready to change the way people listen.  And change what they listen to.  We're already doing it.  It's being done.  And that just drives him nuts that he isn't the first guy to do it.  It's being done already.  This is why I hate radio.  There's a bunch of liars out there that will just spew shit.  Liars.  And their listeners will believe it because their hero is telling them that.  Liars.  What you are about to hear is Howard lying through his teeth. 
[00:57:30]  Sirius went from 600,000 subscribers to over 3 million already.  But basically, these are the numbers that are available to anyone.  XM has 4.4 million subscribers.  Sirius has 1.8.  But yesterday on Howard's program, he said this.  Yeah, but I'll tell you the truth.  Here's what happened.  I'll tell you the truth.  Sirius went from 600,000 subscribers to over 3 million already.  He is insane.  Can somebody have this man committed to an institution before he hurts himself or somebody? 
[00:58:00]  He has obviously lost his fucking mind.  600,000 subscribers to over 3 million already.  I wonder why I think it's going so well.  You want to know why?  Sirius went from 600,000 subscribers to over 3 million already.  3 million already.  Yeah, I'm a liar.  3 million already.  I'll tear your mind out.  I'll burn your soul.  600,000 subscribers to over 3 million already.  I'll turn you into a movie.  I'll turn you into a movie. 
[00:58:30]  I'll turn you into a movie.  I'll turn you into a movie.  Sirius went from 600,000 subscribers to over 3 million already.  3 million already.  He has obviously lost his fucking mind.  Ben's hog is just big enough for my business.  Well, I do have big tips, goddammit.  Goddammit, what nice things.  Whip him out Wednesday.  Whip him out Wednesday.  Ooh, I guess I hope he's taking a leaky guy. 
[00:59:00]  Look who's here.  My pal, Adam.  Hey.  Good morning.  Hi there, pal.  How are you, champ?  Good.  Yes?  Yourself?  I am well.  I'm well.  Wonderful.  Hope he can't get to his post.  There's hope.  You deserted your post, sir. 
[00:59:30]  Everybody's sending me all sorts of pictures of that chick.  What chick?  Alexis.  What's her last name?  How do you say that?  Alexis.  Zina?  D-Z-I-E-N-A.  Jones.  Zina.  I think it's Zina.  Do you pronounce the Z?  The D?  Why not?  Or just Zina.  I'm not pronouncing that D.  I'm leaving it off.  Leave it for someone that needs it like Don or Derek. 
[01:00:00]  Well, we've got a big star on the line here, you guys.  We've got to go right to Michael.  Michael McKean, how are you, sir?  Michael!  Hello.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Michael, your voice is very high this morning.  What the hell do you want?  That must be so nice.  I'm asleep here.  That's got to be so nice to reach the point where you don't even have to wait on the phone  anymore.  Some girl waits for you.  You've got a new girl. 
[01:00:30]  She's a very important woman in this business.  Don't you forget it.  We all know you're a big star, but that's a nice luxury to have, man.  How are you guys?  If you can get a hooker to do your chores and assist you with.  They're ready for you, sir.  Hands over the phone.  You know, it's just an extra $20 tip for a happy ending.  Full release.  Nice.  Michael in studio.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony, Jim Norton, and Adam Farrar.  How are you, Michael?  I know Adam, don't I?  Yeah, we did the Reiner roast together. 
[01:01:00]  Absolutely.  God, you were funny.  Thank you, and so were you.  No, you weren't.  I remember only the funny ones.  The great thing about getting old, you get very selective memory.  You don't remember the people who bored you.  Only the good ones.  Getting old.  You consider yourself an old guy these days?  Well, I have almost a white beard now.  I grew a beard for this play I was doing in Williamstown, Massachusetts.  And, you know, when you start talking like your dad, that's one thing. 
[01:01:30]  But when you start looking like your dad.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, I look very goatish.  But it's made the rest of me look slimmer, so I guess it's working.  Hey, why do you guys do plays?  I know that's such a general question,  but from time to time you see these big movie stars like yourself,  and all of a sudden you go off and do a play,  and I'm thinking, why not take that time to kind of just hang out  and wait for that next big movie or TV show?  Well, because doing plays is more fun than hanging out,  especially if you get to work with people you like. 
[01:02:00]  And have you ever been to Williamstown, Massachusetts?  It's paradise.  It's awesome.  A little muggy, but you had a little muggy here over the weekend in New York.  Is that Western Mass?  Yes, it is.  I saw Michael do a great job in the Woody Allen play.  Oh, you did?  Yes, you did.  You were fabulous.  Oh, thanks.  And every time you talk about the theater, I'm using the word fabulous.  The theater.  Ah, yes.  So, uh...  They're all very artistic, Opie, and they've got to let that out.  You know, I think you guys should do some theater on the air. 
[01:02:30]  You should do, like, you know, the two brothers scene from Death of a Salesman.  Ah, good one.  I think that would be great with you guys.  I want to be Biff.  That's not a bad idea.  We'll just get scripts.  We'll get scripts.  One of you is colder.  Which one of you is more emotionally cold?  Oh, Opie.  Well, he's got to be happy then.  You can be happy.  Yeah.  That'll be ironic.  Opie whistles at funerals.  All right, get the script.  We'll do that on the show just for you.  Yeah.  It'll be awful, but it'll make for some good radio.  What the hell are you working on these days? 
[01:03:00]  Well, I'm here to tell you all about a show that starts Friday on the Independent Film Channel.  It's called Hopeless Pictures, and it was created by Bob Balaban,  and it's this very kind of twisted, dark, and yet very jolly show about Hollywood.  And it's very funny, and we've got a lot of great people in it,  like Jennifer Coolidge and Lisa Kudrow and me and Balaban and Rob Reiner 
[01:03:30]  and just tanks and tanks of funny people.  And it's a very good show, and you should watch it.  Damn it.  There's the plug.  The plug is done.  So let's talk about something else.  The plug for Hopeless Pictures.  It sounds like it's going to be a good show.  It's a very funny show.  It's a little on the nasty side.  So, you know, if the kids are under 10, they can't be watching it with you.  They won't want to anyway.  Are you sick of Spinal Tap questions?  No, no, no.  Go ahead.  Did you guys know that it was going to be just such a cult thing? 
[01:04:00]  That it would hang in there?  When you guys were writing it 20-some-odd years later?  Did you think you were on to something?  Did you feel like you were in that creative zone when you guys were creating that movie?  We just knew we wanted to kind of do it a certain way,  and we also knew that it was hopeless that it was going to be a big hit in the theaters,  and, of course, it wasn't.  It didn't really achieve its life until...  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I mean, at certain places, it was big in New York.  It was big in Los Angeles.  Well, it was medium big in Los Angeles,  and it was huge in Boston for some reason, 
[01:04:30]  probably because there's a couple of jokes about Boston.  Right, right.  But, you know, for the most part, no, the competition was Ghostbusters and, you know, huge, huge comedies like that.  So it really wasn't until video rental kind of settled into a financial groove around the mid-'80s that it really took off.  And it's nice that it's, you know, that we, I think we did build it with some shelf life so it wouldn't become immediately dated.  And it's nice, you know, it's nice when I, you know, young kids, young people come up to me and say, you know, that they just saw it for the first time. 
[01:05:00]  The kids.  Well, the kids come up to me.  Well, one of the things that I do on a regular basis is I talk to a lot of bands, and, man, even the newer bands, they all will refer to that movie.  And they're all watching it on their tour buses and in their vans.  Yeah.  It's never gone away.  We hope it captured some of the grotesque joy of being on the road.  It just hit it right on the head.  I was on the road in another capacity once with another band years ago, 
[01:05:30]  and I saw a great little tableau, which was exactly what Life on the Road is.  The drummer, you know, arrived at the, late at the hotel, and I came upon him sitting on the bed eating potato salad with his toothbrush because he had neglected to get a board.  I said, this is the road.  This is the road.  That sums it up, man.  I've eaten Chinese food out of the ice bucket because I didn't have a bowl. 
[01:06:00]  That's just sad.  Yeah.  Thank God there was no one with a camera.  Were you in a band?  Well, this was actually a band that I was in with David Lander.  It was Squiggy on Laverne and Shirley.  We had a band called Lenny and the Squigtones, and we actually put an album out on Casablanca Records, which was the big disco label.  It was Don Summers and Village People's label.  And it was kind of a disaster. 
[01:06:30]  But we, you know, we toured.  We played like 26 dates, and it was kind of fun.  But it was that.  Lenny and the Squigtones were on tour.  Yeah.  We were on the show, too.  Was it really?  Yeah.  We did the band on the show a couple of times.  I don't recall that.  Yes.  Interesting.  Yeah.  Well, I recall that, Anthony.  Do you recall Lenny and the Squigtones?  One, two, three.  So one of you has better recall than the album.  Is this one of Lenny and the Squigtones' hits?  We have a master computer up here at XM. 
[01:07:00]  We have everything.  Moonlight does funny things, I've heard the wise man say.  When you're in love, your moon shines every day.  You don't even care if you're living or you're dead.  You're a creature without a head.  Yeah, it's the love theme from Creature Without a Head.  You got to move on.  And you toured it.  Nice.  It was in that dream.  You guys have groupies?  You have, quote, unquote. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Yes, we did.  There were a lot of heavy women who wanted us to sign their body parts.  Yeah.  We went another way with it.  Well, off the back way, as a matter of fact.  Anything else planned with Christopher Guest?  Yes.  Everyone's gearing up for a film that we're starting.  Well, they're doing it now.  Chris and Eugene are working on the scenario right now, and Chris is working with the designers.  Starting to shoot in October, a new film called For Your Consideration.  And what will you freaks be doing in that one? 
[01:08:00]  Well, it's kind of peripherally about the movie business, but it's more about the people in movies and theater and high hopes and dashed dreams and all that crap that we go to the movies for.  It's going to be great.  And it's every bit.  You know, Catherine and Eugene and Parker Posey and the whole gang.  Yeah, Coolidge.  How do you get into that fraternity?  You've got to be good at it, I think.  Chris is being plagued by very, very well-established actors coming up to him and saying, I'd love to do one of those things, and realizing that they've never improvised with anything before. 
[01:08:30]  And it takes a little whinging.  But, I mean, you guys do this.  You guys do this every morning, don't you?  You don't have a script.  Yeah, so why can't we be in one of the movies?  Well, I'll put your names in, but I don't have high hopes.  Yeah, I don't either.  What are the odds of a sequel to Used Cars? 
[01:09:00]  Well, let's see.  I think we're all still alive.  Even Jack Warden, who was kind of, you know, he's still around.  How about Frank McRae?  He was one of my favorites.  Oh, isn't he great?  Yeah, he's hilarious.  Yeah, he's one of those guys who was always, when he looms on the screen, you go, oh, we're going to be okay for a little while anyway.  He's a very funny actor.  You know who's great in all the movies that Chris has put together and stuff?  Goddamn, Fred Willard.  Oh, my God.  Well, I've known Fred for 30 years. 
[01:09:30]  He is a very strange man.  He doesn't like having a hotel room near the elevators because of the dinging, you know, the bell.  It's not very strange if you stay in a lot of hotels.  You do realize that.  Well, but this is what he does.  I get bummed out when my room is near the elevator.  But this is what he does.  He travels with little tools, and he disables the bell on the floor.  He goes, and he takes the panel off, and he kills the bell.  But he fixes it before he leaves the hotel.  That's nice of him.  Yeah. 
[01:10:00]  So, yeah, Fred is a very practical lunatic, and we love him.  Hey, Michael, I've got to ask you a question.  Okay.  I'm looking for an honest answer from one of you guys.  Now, your bio is obviously very impressive.  You've done just, I mean, there's like 100 projects listed here that we could go through, okay?  When you're in a movie that you know just stinks, and you have to do press, I mean, how do you get yourself up for that?  Because we were talking to somebody from Deuce Bigelow, European gigolo, whatever. 
[01:10:30]  And obviously the reviews are absolutely awful, and I kind of asked him about it.  How does he feel that the review, and, you know, and he's towing the company line and saying, oh, no, it's funny, and this and that.  And he knows it's a bad movie.  It's not going to kill his career.  He'll go on to some other things that will continue making him a star.  But what goes through your head when you start reading some of these reviews and you just know that they're not off base and that, wow, they nailed this, unfortunately. 
[01:11:00]  And I was hoping they weren't going to nail it.  Well, I've entered a new phase of my life where I read nothing.  I read no reviews.  Really?  My wife, yeah, yeah.  I used to be kind of obsessed with that.  I read everything.  And, you know, if you work hard on a picture and it comes out and it sucks, or at least it sucks in the minds of people who make a living writing about it, then you are kind of left with that eggy thing, you know, where you go, oh, I've got to talk about this thing and everyone knows it sucks.  But, you know, it's just part of the thing. 
[01:11:30]  To be honest, you know, you guys are lovely, but this has never been my favorite thing is to go and, you know, pitch something that I've kind of already done with.  Yeah.  In this case, in the case of Hopeless Pictures, just to drop the name one more time, you know, this is something that Bob Balaban's been trying to get off the ground for a few years, and I've always been part of it.  So it's, you know, I kind of like, you know, rolling along with the momentum here, and we seem to be getting some nice responses.  So, you know, in this case, there's no problem.  But it is a weird thing, but it's just one of those crappy things you have to do, you know. 
[01:12:00]  And when you're filming the movie, is there a point where you realize, uh-oh.  Sometimes.  Yeah.  I did a movie once that I really didn't have much to do in it, but they shot it in sequence, and I'm in the beginning of the movie, the end of the movie, the middle of the movie, and the end of the movie.  And by the end, when I came back after three or four weeks' absence, everyone's relationship had deteriorated.  Everyone despised each other.  Everyone was walking around saying, boy, this is going to be the worst piece of crap ever, and it was. 
[01:12:30]  And I thought, it's just terribly demoralizing, and I have a tendency to look kind of on the bright side and say, well, guys, we still get free dinner, you know.  We get to hang out, and, you know, somebody might be able to score a little something later.  You know, there were good things about making the movie.  So I just look on the bright side, fellas.  Do you make fun of Bob Balaban's beard in Close Encounters?  I make fun of the fact that he made his film debut servicing John Voight in the balcony of a movie theater in Night Cabin. 
[01:13:00]  Wow.  He doesn't like to talk about it, but I do.  I bet.  That was a really hot scene.  It was.  The boy with the glasses who just wanted to be beaten up in the men's room.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow, I didn't even realize that was him.  Yeah, that's him.  What a way to start off.  Yeah.  You're going to suck a dick.  You might as well be in a great film.  I'd like to put you in pictures.  It's only going to go up from here.  Hey, you were in Planes Trains.  I just, on your bio, I didn't know you were in Planes Trains and Automobiles.  It said you were the state trooper.  Are you the one that pulled them over when they... 
[01:13:30]  After the car has been burned.  Yes.  What a funny scene.  I had no idea it was you.  One of my favorite comedies of all time.  Yes, it's a very, it's a funny movie, and it's also a great performance by John Candy.  Yeah.  Steve is amazing in it, too, but that's one of those really, one of those things that  John could really do.  I mean, he was a wonderfully funny actor, but he also, you know, to get too soupy about  this, he had so much heart.  You know, he was just a, he was a wonderful actor and a great guy. 
[01:14:00]  And I think he's beautiful in that film.  It's a really good movie.  Only the Lonely was a good one with him, too.  You know, I don't think I ever saw that.  I remember hearing that that was very good.  I don't think I never got around to seeing that.  Yeah, Ally Sheedy, and I figured I played the mother.  Maureen O'Hara, I think.  Maureen O'Hara, yeah, that's right.  One of my wife's idols, you know, the red-headed Irish girl.  Yeah.  I've got to have someone to look up to.  You also do a killer Stern impression.  That was very good on SNL, because at the time, he was really huge. 
[01:14:30]  I mean, that's pretty much at his peak, and no one really did an impression of him.  And you came out with the wig and really getting the voice down, and that was really, really well done.  Yeah, I wasn't there for very long.  I wasn't on SNL for very long.  No, one of the guys that kind of in and out, like he was on, there are a few of those people that you go, he was on SNL?  Yeah, Randy Quaid?  Yeah, Randy Quaid.  Michael Hall, really?  Randy Quaid, you're a week.  But, yeah, it was a weird thing. 
[01:15:00]  You know, I think it wasn't a marriage made in heaven.  I think the time to do SNL is when you're under 30 and hungry.  In 1978.  And I was over 40 and didn't give a crap, so.  Yeah.  That's me.  Was that it, really?  Well, I just, it wasn't, you know, after Phil Hartman left, I had to do Clinton.  And that's like, you know, following the Beatles with your, you know, with your Beatles medley.  Yeah, he was very good at that.  It was crazy.  You know, but I had some fun. 
[01:15:30]  I made some friends, and I got to live in my favorite city for, you know, a year and a half, so.  Where are you now, L.A.?  Huh?  Where are you now, L.A.?  Mostly L.A., yeah.  I'm in New York City right now.  Can we come over for a barbecue?  Yeah.  Or something?  All right.  We need celebrity friends, please.  The dog won't like you.  A lot of our celebrity friends have blown us off since we blew up our radio career, so  we could use a few new ones.  Oh, okay.  Well, you know, we'll talk.  We'll talk later.  We have Jay Moore.  Jay Moore is a celebrity friend we have. 
[01:16:00]  That's our only friend that we have left in Hollywood.  Jay's a very good boy.  Yeah, we like Jay.  He wrote some stuff about me in that book of his.  Uh-huh.  It's a little exaggerated.  Oh, is it?  What did he write about you?  Huh?  What did he write about you in the book?  Oh, he wrote that I ate a whole block of hashish, a whole brick, and it's just not true.  No?  No.  Yeah, because everyone knows you just need a little.  Why waste that much cash?  You can just take a little, yeah.  Save the rest for later.  No, but he's very flattering.  We did have a nice time there, and we were both kind of, you know, had a little touch of 
[01:16:30]  the outcast to us.  But we did have some fun.  Yeah.  Very good.  Yeah, Michael.  Good talking to you.  Same here, guys.  Do you know how funny that scene was in used cars when the hood goes up and it rips her  shirt off?  Oh, yeah.  Bless her heart.  I'm trying to take her name.  David says, oh, Jesus, she's caught on the hood ornament.  Oh, don't you hate women?  That was one of the funniest lines in movie history.  That was a very funny movie.  It's kind of dated now because the whole thing about, you know, seeing naked women on your 
[01:17:00]  TV, we see naked women on TV all the time now.  Right.  So it's got this kind of dated quality to it.  But, like you say, Frank McRae and Jack Warden and Kurt Russell.  That's brilliant.  Yeah, really funny.  And Kurt Russell is a really underrated comic actor.  He's a very funny actor.  He's very funny in that film.  You had a great career, man.  Really good career. 
[01:17:30]  Hey, as long as I ain't dead, you know what I mean?  Yeah, really?  Had, Jimmy?  No, no, no.  I mean, just ain't really look back over what he's had so far.  He's been in some great comedies, man.  Yeah.  All right, Michael.  Thank you, guys.  It's Michael McKean.  The new show is Hopeless Pictures.  New show on Independent Film Channel, the IFC.  And it starts when?  It starts Friday night.  Friday night.  Very good.  Okay, gentlemen.  Always a pleasure, Michael.  Thank you.  Thank you, Michael.  Bye-bye.  That really was like you were sending somebody off to their death.  Well, you've had a great career.  Yeah, you've had a great career.  You know what I mean?  I'm so sorry to hear about the news.  Ah, I wanted to ask him about Parker Posey. 
[01:18:00]  Why she hasn't just exploded in Hollywood.  I think they're dodging her.  Oh, boss.  Oh, stupid boss.  His stiff hands.  She was so good in the House of Yes.  I know, stupid.  Parker Posey is being shunned.  I think she's blacklisted.  Shut up.  He just likes the fact that there's an S in her name and he can actually say it without  tripping over his own stupid fat tongue.  Parker Posey.  Posey.  Posey.  All right, why don't we take a break?  I'm for ours here.  We'll take a quick break, regroup, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:18:30]  This weekend, for the first time in Toyota history, an unprecedented sale will change  everything.  What if we told you to get any new car, truck, or SUV, all you needed was $99 down and $99  a month?  I'd say you were full of shit.  Well, we're not.  Get ready for the no shit sale from Toyota.  No shit.  No shit.  No shit.  Toby Hines, fearless leader at Gulf States, Toyota has gone completely apeshit and authorized  us to sell you any car, truck, or SUV for a ridiculously low $99 down and $99 a month. 
[01:19:00]  No shit.  No shit.  You've got to be shitting me.  Nope, this shit is for real.  It's the no shit sale from Toyota.  $99 down, $99 a month.  But you better hurry because this shit won't be around forever.  In other words, shit or get off the pot?  Exactly.  It's the no shit sale.  $99 down and $99 a month gets you any car, truck, or SUV you want.  Holy f***ing shit.  You said it.  See your Toyota dealer now. 
[01:19:30]  Get the feeling.  Toyota.  $99 down payment, $99 monthly payment, not through Gulf States Toyota.  No shit sale does not apply to any existing Toyota car, truck, or SUV anywhere, anyhow,  anytime.  Not a limited time offer.  Don't see dealer for details.  In other words, we're full of shit.  It's around one day.  It's crazy.  It's what it's all about.  It's around one day.  Oh, I love this.  Short and peace.  Wow.  T-Shot 36 double D.  T-Shot 36 double D. 
[01:20:00]  Shoving her breasts in everyone's face.  36 double D.  T-Shot 36 double D.  Oh, wow.  She just will purse out.  She just will purse out anywhere.  With the Mount Wednesday.  She'll flash it.  She'll flash it.  Hey, I'm all for it.  She'll flash it.  And there's boobs in your face.  I'm all for it.  With the Mount Wednesday.  The night that's dressed.  Hey.  This is what it's all about. 
[01:20:30]  With the Mount Wednesday.  Oh, I love this.  Sure.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Whip them fuckers out.  This is fantastic. 
[01:21:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  That's why we call it.  Wow.  Talk about the boobies.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow. 
[01:21:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Let's do that tomorrow. 
[01:22:00]  The show when we go to break is much more interesting than the show we do on the air.  Let's just be honest.  We just got to have the mics on the entire time.  Jimmy noticed that I keep my headphone volume really loud.  It's ridiculously loud.  People in Jersey know it's loud. 
[01:22:30]  You're going to injure yourself.  We're not. We're trying to help you.  We're concerned, Opie.  It's tough love.  This isn't an intervention. It's just headphone volume.  It's tough love!  It's just a headphone volume problem.  When we come back from break, Derek will come on the headphones and go,  you guys got a minute, just so we kind of know.  And I heard it. It was like it was in surround sound.  And I looked down and it was Opie's headphones on the console.  Did that come out of your headphones?  I thought he whispered it to me.  They were rattling.  It's blasting.  You can't... 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, I could hear it through your headphones.  You can?  It's ridiculous.  Wait, why didn't he say it? That would have helped.  Oh, yeah. Say something, Derek.  I want you to say it.  Hey, how's it going?  No, no.  Yeah.  Hi.  Oh.  It's not that bad.  Yes, it is.  It's very loud.  It's blasting.  So I decided that maybe I need my ears cleaned, so we're going to do it on the show tomorrow.  I'm going to get that candle thing.  Now, that could be the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.  They did it to Star Jones on The View one day. 
[01:23:30]  You know what came out?  Cake.  Chocolate mousse.  They put a straw, what amounts to a wax-covered, flammable-type straw, in your ear.  So it's in your ear canal.  And then you light the tip.  And I guess from the heat, it draws the air out.  It makes a vacuum in the straw.  And that then pulls the wax out of your ear canal and into the straw.  Then you burn it down to a certain length.  And then the straw is now full of ear wax. 
[01:24:00]  So you can open it up, and now you have this perfectly formed tube of ear wax.  Looks like an unsalted pretzel stick.  I swear to God, I was wondering, how does that work?  I really thought that it would heat up and then kind of stick to the wax, and you just  pull it all out like something with a hook in it.  Oh, great.  Simple physics.  Pressure.  That way you pull out your entire inner ear.  Oh, no, no.  Anthony's right, though.  Clean your ears, you filthy animal.  I do.  How about a Q-tip?  I-I-I-Q-tip.  A little wound.  It looks like, some mornings it looks like chunky peanut butter. 
[01:24:30]  Why don't we do it today?  Disgusting.  Get some Q-tips.  It's still early.  Let's go.  Go ahead.  Run down to Duane Reade.  Let's try to find the ear cleaning system.  Get some goddamn...  Opie gets ear cleaning straws.  And get that, you know what, get that syringe.  I'm like a fucking maniac out of me.  That ball where you can shoot the water into your ears.  Nice.  I used that.  All right.  The ear douche.  I used that once.  Oh, I got a mouse update.  What?  Your mouse has ear?  I'm changing the subject really well.  Very fast, because we've got a lot to do today.  All right.  So that's what I do now.  We've got to plug Adam's Caroline's days. 
[01:25:00]  Oh!  Adam who, Adam?  Adam Farrar is going to be at Caroline's.  When?  August 25th through the 28th.  25th through the 28th.  Thursday through Sunday.  That's next week.  I'm away.  We're away.  We can't go see you.  Am I coming back on the 27th, I think?  I'm just going.  You've come down.  Where are you going?  I'm just going.  I don't know where yet.  Going to the Caribbean.  I am?  Ooh.  Yes.  I'm out of here.  On a cruise or a flight?  No, flying down there.  We're in the Caribbean. 
[01:25:30]  A little gambling.  I don't want to say, because listeners get stupid.  Okay.  Or people from the show show up and want to gamble with me.  Ruin my evenings.  Paul.  I'm teasing.  We came all the way down to Couples and the Grill, because we heard.  I was gambling with Anthony.  Yes.  With Anthony.  We was playing some free card poker.  Free card poker?  Really?  It was free?  No.  Not free.  Free.  Ooh.  Fucking lamey.  What do you want?  All right.  So we'll get the ears cleaned out today on the show. 
[01:26:00]  Who else is going to do it?  I will not do that.  I'll absolutely do that.  I will challenge Jimmy.  I say I have less wax.  I'll do it.  You probably are loaded with earwax.  Yeah.  You can't hear.  You know what loud sounds does inside your ear?  What?  Your ear secretes more wax to protect the innards of your ear.  So every time you put it louder, you're just making more wax.  The more wax you make, the louder you have to make it.  What did you watch?  An ear special on the Discovery Channel?  Oh, he's fucking like an ENT. 
[01:26:30]  Well, you know, it's simple physics that if you light the candle, it doesn't really.  Who knew that shit?  There's three bones in the ear.  The hammer, the anvil, and the stirrup.  Oh, Adam's not listening.  Adam.  Have a scone.  We're talking about, like, ears, and then Adam just doesn't even listen.  We played the Professor Anthony theme after he amazes us with his knowledge.  So what?  Five more minutes.  You can't step on the theme, Adam.  You can't step on the theme song after Anthony.  I'm sorry.  I couldn't hear it.  My ears were loaded with wax.  Five more minutes, it'll fucking happen again with something. 
[01:27:00]  You know, technically, the ear is protected.  Is it?  I just use a fucking thing.  I scoop it out, and I go, ooh, yummy.  Smells tart.  Throw it on a rich cracker with some jelly, and you've got a nice little snack.  Here's the theme.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Because he knows a little bit about everything.  I try.  He makes Jimmy and I, on a daily basis, look really stupid.  That is not my purpose.  I do not try to do that.  You don't know.  I just, I know something about the inner ear. 
[01:27:30]  And you notice that when he'll chill very actual, he's just like, you know, I've kind  of heard that the inner ear, and then I spit out simple physics.  Is it really?  Because Anthony's just, the thing about Anthony, he's just a nice guy overall.  I try.  He wants to give you knowledge, but he doesn't want to make it look like he really knows  that much more than anyone else.  He's just very polite about what he knows.  That's the difference between he and I.  I would have said, no, it sucks it up, assholes.  That's physics, fucking dummies. 
[01:28:00]  The little I know, I make sure people feel stupid when I spew it.  I would have let you hang yourself, and then I would have spit it right in your stupid  faces.  That's right.  If I knew that.  That's where I agree with Jimmy.  Oh, really?  You didn't know about this?  Well, let me tell you something.  Well, would you like to wager a little something?  Yeah.  Listen, wax head.  Somebody on Instant Feedback, not Yemen, is from Wackbag, is saying the straws don't work.  Google it, and you will see. 
[01:28:30]  No, I've seen it on the view.  What is...  I don't get this one.  Mr. Motherfucker from Wackbag.  Go ahead, Mr. Motherfucker.  Yes, tomorrow on Pounder, are we going to get to see Opie doing the Richard Pryor 100-yard  dash?  Oh, if you catch on fire.  That was good, though, that you said 100 at first, and then corrected yourself.  Yeah, I'm an ass.  At least you used a topical reference.  Yeah, for flames.  Everyone is saying that the ear candle thing doesn't work. 
[01:29:00]  Richard Pryor.  That's awful.  Jesus, is Mrs. O'Leary's cow going to knock something into Opie's ear?  Asshole.  Opie, it'll look like a Viking funeral pyre.  Brian, D.C., what's up?  Yeah, the ear candles don't work.  Why is that, sir?  Well, test them out, try taking one of them, and just putting it in a cup of water and  lighten it.  It's actually not the ear wax.  It's just the wax from the candle that falls into the pillar. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, was that it, really?  That's it, yeah.  What's up?  We tried doing it in our ears, then we tried doing it, sticking it in a cup of water, doing  the same thing.  Got the exact same shit out of both of them.  Yeah, what'd you do that?  Was it a Friday night or a New Year's Eve party?  Yeah, it was a New Year's Eve party.  How awful does that sound?  But you know what?  That makes sense, because the candle burns down.  Where's it supposed to go?  Yeah, no, that's all it was.  You put it in your ear?  My girlfriend had the idea of doing it.  I didn't believe it, so we saved one extra one.  We put it in a cup of water.  We figured that if it's really sucking out ear wax, it shouldn't be anything in the candle 
[01:30:00]  afterwards.  Where else did you put it?  Well, I don't want to talk about that.  No, it was not.  It's not going to go with it, Ant.  All right, thank you, sir.  Dan in Indiana.  Dan?  Yo.  Hey.  Hey, I'm with the guy in D.C., man.  It's a total sham.  After you do one, just save one and put it in, like, a fucking empty glass or something.  All right, we'll try that experiment on the air.  Yeah.  It'll be full of wax.  Kyle in Maryland.  Hey, guys.  These other guys are tools. 
[01:30:30]  I do that stuff every couple weeks.  It works.  The stuff comes out, and it looks like something Jimmy could smear on his chest.  Well, they're saying that's from the candle or whatever.  No, no, no.  What it is, the candles are made of, like, a linen, and then the linen has, like, a very  light coating of wax on it, and it basically burns away into ash.  It doesn't really burn down into the candle.  It creates what Professor Anthony was right there.  It just sucks it all out of your ear.  All right.  Why don't we get an expert on this instead of, like, some dopey listener that's, like,  high right now in the middle of America?  Yeah, let's get Paul Madam Zola. 
[01:31:00]  Nick, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Great talking to you.  I haven't listened to you guys since you were at W.A.W.  I love your show.  You're a speech therapist?  That's right.  You really can't speak very well.  I'm a little nervous.  Oh, don't be nervous.  It's maybe a million people listening right now.  You said, like, I used to listen to you guys on the W.A.W.  You're slurring all your words, sir.  Just nervous.  I listened to you guys about the ear thing, and really the best thing to do is you really 
[01:31:30]  need to go have a doctor just put a scope in your ear and look and see, because if there  really is earwax blocking it, you're going to see it as soon as you use a scope.  And then if there is a chance you have the earwax, then the doctor would take it out.  But otherwise, you know, with exposing yourself to such loud noise every day, there's a good  chance, you know, you don't want to be inflicting the hearing loss on yourself.  You're a nervous, Nellie.  Well, you know, I had an EMT look at my ear, and he said that I had a little bit of wax 
[01:32:00]  and he took it out.  All right.  I'm a speech therapist.  Okay, now we're going to work on a problem you have with pronunciation of the P, so just  go...  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Steve.  The unique speech therapist.  Steve, Fort Worth, Texas.  What's up?  It's like Voss being a speech therapist.  You have to put five marbles in your mouth, not four.  Dope.  Steve, go ahead. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, yeah.  Hey, first time caller, long time listening.  Wow.  Cheers.  Hey, the bid on the Toyota, is that a real commercial or a fake commercial?  Of course it's a real commercial.  All right.  Yeah.  Getting all the big sponsors on our show now.  Satellite radio, man.  That's right.  Let's move on.  James, Tennessee, what's up?  Hey, what are y'all doing?  Hey.  Hi.  Hey, C.B.  Slandy, Tim.  I'm eating apple cakes.  I see that.  Oh, I was going to tell you about a mousetrap that I got.  Sorry, my C.B. radio was on.  C.B.?  Yeah. 
[01:33:00]  1976 just called.  Oh, thanks a lot, man.  He's spitting.  Hey, I was going to tell you about a mousetrap that I got, and I'm sending it to you.  It's electronic mousetrap.  Remember Ghostbusters when the ghost got caught in there and beeped?  Yeah.  This thing is electric, and you put the peanut butter in, and you never have to change it  because they don't even get to the peanut butter.  They walk into this trap, they get electric.  Oh, I love it.  That's what you need, an electric chair for mice.  It's got a little door on it. 
[01:33:30]  You just pop it open and just put it in the trash.  That's it.  Send it.  Send it.  I have a mouse update, by the way.  They're going to find Opie dead with his fucking hair sticking straight up and his finger in a fucking mousetrap.  That's good.  Don't send it to him.  The smell of peanut butter all over the house.  Or they're going to embarrassingly find him with his pants down and his cock in the trap.  But I'm telling you, one of my friends runs a hardware store, and he gave it to me.  I caught like eight the first day.  And every time that they went in there and got electrocuted, the light would just start beeping red. 
[01:34:00]  Where the hell did you live, sir?  In a cancer lab?  Anyway, I am serving it.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  See you.  You would think that would burn him or something.  My new hobby, my new obsession is catching mice.  That's correct.  I never realized how much fun it could be.  Really?  I swear to God.  I'm up to six that I've caught in my fine apartment.  How have you caught them?  Just regular trap?  Well, I started off by just catching them by hand.  You know, just... 
[01:34:30]  Really, grasshopper?  Just running around?  Strategically getting things in the pails, and they go in there, and then I get them, and  then I release them.  Then someone had to tell me that they leave urine behind to find their way back.  So I think I might have been catching the same mouse over and over again.  That's why the hookers keep coming back to Jimmy's apartment.  They just show up at the door.  So then I used...  Led right up to his chest.  I put peanut butter on my face, and they just crawl up and piss.  So then I used the same technique, caught the mouse again, and then tied him in about 
[01:35:00]  four or five bags to suffocate him and throw him in the garbage.  That's right.  That's what I did, Adam.  Hope he's happy, humane way.  Well, mice can't chew their way out of plastic bags.  It's a good thing you did that.  He's fucking chewed through granite to get into your apartment.  Oh, you make...  But that bag got him.  You make fun of me, but something happened, because that mouse never came back.  Not only did he come back, but he got 40 friends to come with him.  This idiot thinks a plastic bag will stop us.  Come on, boys.  Was he wearing a derby?  I like the way your mice talk.  Come on, Wime. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, I don't think he came back, because I was mouse-free for a very long time.  Maybe I just scared the little fella.  Maybe.  So then I went to the mouse traps, and I got one good over the weekend with the mouse trap.  Cut him in half?  Bam!  Oh, yeah, cut him in half.  Broke his little mouse spine.  But you said you got six of them, but they're still there.  There's still more.  No, I caught another one last night.  If you think you have six, you have 60.  Yeah.  You're infested.  You don't see them.  And how do you know they're different mice? 
[01:36:00]  How could you tell one mouse from another?  Well, the last two I caught...  I know.  I know.  It's like, there's mouse number five right there.  Well, I think when you cut him in half, you can identify him.  No, yeah.  You know he's not coming back, but if you think you have six, I don't know how you're counting.  That one was dead.  Because they're all standing there in formation in the middle of the room.  Did Steve try to help people when it ran in, he jumped up on a chair?  No, I got one with the mousetrap. 
[01:36:30]  Split him pretty much in half.  I was very happy.  Holy shit.  You ever see a mouse come apart like that?  And then I had a mousetrap at him.  How the mouse nibbles, man.  He's laughing at you.  Then I had a mousetrap that I had a real tough time setting the last couple days.  I almost broke three fingers because I kept setting it off.  And then I decided I needed to put granola on the mousetrap, and that went flying all over the apartment.  So then I threw the mousetrap against the wall, all pissed off, and I said, I'm done with this. 
[01:37:00]  Because the mouse, the new mouse is, go ahead, what?  Just giggling.  Just picture you sitting there with apple spice or maple syrup granola.  What will the mice like?  Those are rat traps you have.  Mice traps shouldn't be snapping your hands.  You're going to catch like that giant kangaroo?  That boxing kangaroo?  Adam, just let him go for a while. 
[01:37:30]  A mouse is attempting to bring outside Mice's into this situation.  You like peanut butter, Dad?  You stay out of Opie's apartment, you hear?  You stay out of Opie's apartment.  It makes them giggle. 
[01:38:00]  Just sit back and let them finish.  Greatest movies of all time.  Fantastic.  This could be the hundredth time they've done this.  Snap a mousetrap on your fingers, did you, Grady?  Grady?  Grady?  Grady?  Grady?  Grady?  Grady?  Grady?  Grady?  Grady?  Grady?  Grady?  Grady?  Grady?  Grady?  Grady?  Grady?  Grady?  Grady?  Grady?  Grady? 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Oh, very funny.  Love the shining.  All right.  So I discovered this new mouse was just too smart, and it wasn't...  Smart?  It wasn't getting caught in the mousetrap.  That was catching me instead.  And I tried everything, and I set it with peanut butter, cheese.  I even did what Anthony said and wedged that cheese in nice.  Yeah, get it up there so he's really got to pull on it.  Still got the cheese out, Anthony.  Yeah?  So he got the cheese off of there without... 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, I don't know what the hell's going on.  Take a little piece of thread and tie it to the...  Why not?  That's a good idea, too.  You'll get them.  How about this?  Move.  That's a good idea.  No, it's my new obsession.  It's kind of like fishing.  Every morning I'll wake up and see what I got.  Oh, I'm kidding.  Wonderful.  I'm not even kidding.  I'm not even kidding.  Because, you know, you get bubonic plague from fishing, too.  So I got...  I went to the next level.  That's a Hunter virus.  I went to the next level.  I got the glue traps.  Bubonic. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, bubonic plague.  Bubonic.  Bubonic?  I think so.  You could say it both ways, and I'm positive of that.  So fuck you as all if you want to...  But B-U-B wouldn't be bubonic.  Oh, of course not.  Bubonic.  What?  B-O-O-B?  Bubonic?  Bubonic.  Bubonic.  I don't think it's bubonic.  No, it's not bubonic.  It's pronounced both ways.  It can be pronounced both ways.  Give me a God...  You're right.  One would be correct, and one would be incorrect.  Find me a jury.  Find me a jury.  So...  The correct way and the incorrect way. 
[01:40:00]  I hear you.  Asshole.  So I graduated to glue traps.  Anthony.  I'm putting bubonic in the dictionary.  I'm not listening, but...  How long does it take you to get the glue traps off your hands?  You know, we can do like two shows today.  Adam and I will talk, and those guys will talk.  And let the listeners try to figure it all out.  He's doing Kevin Dillon, and I'm just giggling.  But your story with Adam is going back and forth.  Oh, I understand.  That's the beauty of what we do.  I hate to come apart. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  You're looking that up, Ant.  I want to know about the pronunciation.  Steve would know.  No, he wouldn't.  Steve, how do you say bubonic?  B-U-B-O...  B-U-B-O-B...  What?  B-U-B-O-N-I-C.  It's bubonic, stupid.  All right.  No, it's bubonic.  It's bubonic.  No, it's not.  Look, there are two O's with a long O pronunciation after that.  B-U-B-O-N-I-C.  Motherfucker.  That's wrong.  And you know something?  I was wrong.  You're right.  I was wrong.  It is only pronounced one way.  The way I say it. 
[01:41:00]  Bubonic.  No one says bubonic.  It's bubon...  Everybody says...  Well, goddamn Webster says bubonic.  It's written right there.  It's not written...  But you're saying that wrong.  I'm telling you.  I've read it.  No, you haven't.  You're a lying sack of shit.  Webster is a bag of douche.  Bubonic.  Really?  After you have a few beers, do you poo in the toilet?  It's pertaining to a bubo or buboes, which are the sores on you, where the word boo-boo  came from, by the way.  Bubo.  So it's bubonic, not buboes. 
[01:41:30]  It's spelled B-U-B, though, right?  Yes, it is spelled B-U-B.  But, unfortunately, it's pronounced bubonic.  I don't forget.  No.  Aristotle.  No.  Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Well, according to that, it should be fuck Aristotle.  Go fuck yourself.  And, Rich, I did not say mouses.  Or did I?  No, Anthony.  You hate meeses to pieces.  So I went to the glue traps. 
[01:42:00]  Let me get through this, because it's a bore fest, I understand, but people want an update.  So I got the glue traps, where you just lay these sticky glue things down.  We've seen them.  They're horrendous.  Well, look at my arm.  I lost all the hair on this one.  Would you stick your arm in it?  They don't come off, man.  Look at it.  There's no hair right up here.  It's like a horrible mouse tar pit.  I'm trying to set this thing, and I get stuck to it, and now I'm ripping hair out.  I want you to clean out your ears so you can hear the mice laughing at you. 
[01:42:30]  I'm just a mess with trying to set these damn traps.  Do you ever take one of those glue traps, though, and you pull on your pants, and you put your dick hole first right into the middle of it?  Ow.  You try to peel it off slowly while the phone is ringing.  Mother.  So I set the glue traps with the mouse trap in the middle of it with the cheese.  I had this whole thing going all in a bag for a nice cleanup, and I say, nighty-night, mouse. 
[01:43:00]  And I go to bed.  Did you actually say that?  That's right.  I said, nighty-night.  Nighty-night, mouse.  Have fun with this, sir.  And then I go to bed, and I told you, like, my kitchen, I have, like, a kitchen door that's kind of pretty much separate from the apartment, more or less.  And I close the door.  The guy's working a foley set over here.  Was a horse in there?  The door.  That lit a fire.  Look.  Look, this guy is with me, man. 
[01:43:30]  Lenny in Texas.  Go ahead, Lenny.  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  I'm with Opie on this one, man.  Once you start killing him, that shit is addictive as hell.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man, in college.  We were in a nice house, but, you know, we found one mice, and right from there, man, it was one after the other.  And my roommate was a little off-center.  He was a Marine.  This guy's in asses.  This guy's in college, and that motherfucker was using a blowgun.  A blowgun?  A blowgun.  One of those little blow dart guns. 
[01:44:00]  A blow dart.  It's great.  You could have competitions.  You could set up different traps and see whose trap's going to catch the mouse.  That's great.  Then you get S&M videos, and then children and prostitutes are missing from your neighborhood.  Nice.  It's beautiful.  No, the worst one, we had a girlfriend over at the house, and she saw one flip out and screamed to high heaven.  The goddamn thing jumped up about two feet in the air and must have had a stroke or freaked out and died, dropped dead right there.  There you have it.  So, I'm telling you, it's addicting.  I'm with this guy.  So, I go to bed. 
[01:44:30]  I wake up a little early today, almost like it's Christmas morning.  Oh, you're ready to unwrap your package.  I've been sleeping to my alarm for weeks.  But for some reason, I got up early this morning.  Before the alarm clock, it was around 4.45 in the morning.  You have no lights.  What was the first thing I did?  You got to check on your mouse.  I had to check on my glue trap.  I opened that door to the kitchen.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me, please.  And then I peek around the corner where the fridge is. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  And sure enough, I got the sucker.  Really?  And the glue.  Yeah.  And he's just sitting there.  He tried to gnaw off his own...  His own everything that's stuck in the trap.  They get caught under a big buble of glue is what happens.  It's bubble.  Oh, is it?  I thought it was buble.  I'm an ass.  No, no, no.  It's buble.  A buble of glue.  And there was the little fella. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  The weird thing is he was able to get the cheese from the mouse trap, but he still got stuck  on the edge.  He almost made it.  Thought he made it.  Almost made it.  He got stuck on the edge of the glue trap.  He was just sitting there really miserable.  Was he alive when you saw him?  Yeah, unfortunately.  I hate that.  With his little mouse leg half chewed off, trying to chew his way through.  Looking up at you with that hunter's helmet on and spear in your hand.  The great white hunter.  Pounding your chest.  Those are awful, dude. 
[01:46:00]  These glue traps are terrible.  I didn't know what else to do.  The other way wasn't working.  Someone is sending me some kind of sonar type trap, I guess.  Those things that are supposed to chase the mice out of your house with the sound waves,  they don't work.  They're going to chase them to the neighbor, I'm hoping.  Yeah, no, they don't work.  Just don't put it in backwards.  It'll bring them in.  But it's kind of weird to set your traps and, you know, look the next day, like Christmas,  to see what you got.  Don't you feel bad, though?  The poor mouses are all glued up and shit, man.  I definitely felt bad.  I'm not going to, like, you know, fake it for the radio.  It was, like, kind of an awful sight. 
[01:46:30]  Did you kill it at least, quickly?  Don't tell me you threw it out like that.  You threw it out like that, didn't you?  You're just going to starve to death.  You can't throw it out like that.  You've got to just step on it.  At least put it in a plastic bag.  At least take the glue on the trap and stick it over his little nose and mouth.  Come on, great hunter.  Or maybe just cover his eyes with it so when he backs up.  Now, you've got to remember, there was the bag and the mousetrap that was still set.  Oh, dude.  Yeah.  You could have slipped his head under the mousetrap.  That's what I did.  You snapped his head.  I played execution. 
[01:47:00]  Okay.  Because I couldn't.  At that point, he was effed.  And I wasn't going to jump on it.  I wasn't going to step on the bag.  So I kind of took the glue trap and just like shoved it into the bag and bam!  Good night.  It's really twisted.  I don't know what else to do, though.  And you find this fun and addictive?  That's the gas chamber and the firing squad at the same time.  That's where the glue trap sucks because, you know, it's still alive when you see it there.  There are many better traps out there.  I'm trying everything.  Cleaner. 
[01:47:30]  They starve to death.  They have the ones that you can, yeah, you can release them.  And back into the wilds of Manhattan after you're done.  Yeah.  You got to put them in your car.  Drive them far away.  Drive them here.  Let them out on 57.  Hey, boy, get the stick.  Get the stick.  Yeah.  Fetch.  Fetch.  You take them out of the station wagon.  Make them chase the stick.  And then you drive away.  Let them go in the office.  They'll fucking hide in Ben's desk.  We'll never see him again.  In his hair.  Ah!  He scratches.  A fucking mouth falls on his shoulder. 
[01:48:00]  All right.  Well, that's the update on that.  Does anybody else in your building have these Mises?  Oh, I don't talk to anyone else in my building.  Yeah, that would be silly.  That is ridiculous.  You don't do that in Manhattan.  Are you insane?  All right.  We're going to take a break.  I was walking down my hallway the other day in my building, and a guy who I've never seen  before went, hi, Jim.  I was like, oof.  Someone knows you?  I guess so, yeah.  Yeah, they want to be your friend.  Probably saw you.  No, he's just walking by.  He's just being polite or whatever.  He's like, oof.  Kind of weird.  In your building, no, you? 
[01:48:30]  That's why I like the suburbs and a house.  No more apartment.  No more building.  No more people.  It's wonderful.  Do you have a doormat?  Yes.  And security.  You got people that smoke out front?  I wouldn't know.  I live on the 10th floor.  And you jump out the window when you fucking leave your place?  How do you get out?  The helicopter on the roof?  I mean, when you leave the building itself.  I mean, like, I don't know what they do.  They used to out in the other place. 
[01:49:00]  All these people, I don't know what they do.  I don't look up when I walk through the streets.  I just get out and go into the limousine that XM provides for me.  That is exactly what everybody here does.  We all know that.  It's yellow with a big light on top.  Yes.  Because I know my apartment that I was living in in Brooklyn, when you left, you had to go through a smoke cloud.  Oh, no.  Because everybody didn't want to smoke in their apartment, so they smoke in the lobby and by the front door.  And it's just a mess.  Not in my fancy building with fancy people.  Very fancy.  I bet they're all out front with those big, long cigarette holders like the 20s.  Let me tell you, darling, it's a beautiful day. 
[01:49:30]  Something like that, maybe.  All right.  We got the chimp story.  Do you want to do it now or take a break?  You got chimps in your apartment now?  No.  Where the hell do you live?  We'll be at Caroline's next weekend.  If he wants to catch me, he has to leave his balls out on the counter overnight.  I come home, there's chimp shit flung all over the kitchen.  Want to keep going or you want to take a quick break?  What we could do is a quick break.  We could do the chimp attack survivor story. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, that'll get everybody up to speed.  And then we also have, we're going to do news teases today, Anthony, one of our favorite bits.  I love the news tease.  All right.  Why don't we step aside for a quick one and we'll return.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  How about that woman that took her shirt off?  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday. 
[01:50:30]  Show us your fun dance.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  Oh, this is fantastic.  This sounds beautiful.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  Cancel your appointments.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday. 
[01:51:00]  Stay out the bushes.  It's Wimper Mal Wednesday.  It's Wimper Mal Wednesday.  It's Wimper Mal Wednesday.  Oh, yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  XM 202. 
[01:51:30]  All right.  In studio today, Adam Farrar playing Caroline's a week from tomorrow.  25 through 28.  August 25th through the 28th.  Very good.  Very good.  Good friend of the show, Adam Farrar.  Always nice to come back.  I'm sorry you're having rodent problems.  It's a pain in the ass.  How long has this been going on?  Well, we've got to, I think we all need to just finally buy houses. 
[01:52:00]  Jimmy Norton is the only one.  Jimmy Norton is the one that bought a place.  Yeah.  Bastard.  And we, you know, I'm renting.  And like I said yesterday, I have a moth problem.  I have moths.  Really?  Yeah.  What traps are you setting?  They're very tiny.  Little light bulbs.  And you have to put a tiny little sweater on there.  And they jump in and you, it just doesn't show faith in what we do.  And I have been at this for 10 years. 
[01:52:30]  We've had a lot of success, but we...  No confidence.  But we know what we're all about.  And we know we can blow this up at any given moment.  So you can't go and buy a house.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here's the house.  Sign here.  You're fired.  Yeah.  What?  I just bought a house.  And our new contract, because we effed up so bad.  And it's like year to year.  So it's like...  Yeah.  Stay of execution.  We're on double secret probation.  I guess they picked up our next year already, but that's nice.  So at least we know we have maybe 14 months. 
[01:53:00]  Wait.  Did we find that out?  Yeah.  They picked it up.  Of course they picked it up.  I hope so.  Yeah.  So it would be nice if they just picked up the rest of our contract.  That's okay.  I bought...  So we could buy houses and stuff.  Yeah.  How about picking up the whole deal?  How about you do that?  I bought my loft, and the next thing I heard...  You're canceled.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Exactly.  Thank you very much.  When I moved into the city two months later, the fucking boot.  Right off.  When I first moved in.  Yeah.  It was awful.  It was that great.  All right.  Yeah.  You had just bought your place.  I bought my place.  The show was going good. 
[01:53:30]  We get canceled.  I'm doing the new love boat, because I need dental.  Calling up Olive Garden.  Hey, they worked the first time.  What do you think?  Hospitaliano.  Still got it.  Like I'm Ralph Mouth.  Still got it.  Nothing better than seeing your pal on an Olive Garden commercial.  Shut up.  Hey, there.  When my family comes in, we all go to the Olive Garden there.  Sure you do, Adam.  Did your mother just want to choke you?  Yeah.  Of course she did. 
[01:54:00]  Ugh.  My father said the funniest thing.  You want to be an artist?  Go rent a loft and be misunderstood.  You got to pay the bills.  That ain't a real Italian restaurant.  No self-respecting Italian restaurant is going to have a window that big so people can drive  by and fucking aim.  Sell the veal, cash the check.  And you did.  Yep.  And you did.  And the job's out on DVD now, too.  Yeah.  Oh, you get anything for that for that?  No.  Nothing?  Nothing.  You should get a couple of bucks.  A few shekels would have killed him. 
[01:54:30]  Wait until I get a hold of Dennis Leary.  Get on there.  I'm going to tell him.  First, I'm going to tell him, my pal would make a great fireman.  He would make a fantastic fireman.  We don't have a hat small enough for his friggin' hat.  All right.  Why don't we get to the chimp story?  What's the chimp story?  We were talking...  Oh, wait.  Was it before you got here?  I guess it was.  The chase in Newark?  No.  There's chimps in Newark.  No, I was saying we were talking about it during the chase in Newark.  Oh, okay.  It did get brought up, yeah. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, that's what it was.  Why every time I...  Oh, you people.  People and you're just so accusing.  The guy was released from the hospital.  Yes.  He had a little encounter with a chimp.  A run-in with a chimpanzee who bit off his fingers.  Ate his face.  Oh, that guy.  And...  And...  Chewed off his testicles.  You know how awful it must be to get your balls chewed off by a fucking primate? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  That's what they do.  They know, you know, hey, I don't like this guy, and I'm sure I wouldn't like his kids.  Jesus.  So I'm just going to eat his balls now and put a stop to his whole family lineage.  That's how chimps work.  The Mafia should do that in Vendettas, because you know how they kill the oldest son or whatever  so he won't come back.  Boy, that would be an effective method.  I'm going to eat your balls.  Antonio Andolini.  Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo. 
[01:56:00]  Hey, the penthouse girl.  Michael Corleone says hello.  I'm sure.  They ate Sonny's balls at the causeway.  Put an athletic supporter on him.  I don't want his mother to see him this way.  It means he's digesting Luca Brasi's balls.  Wow.  What are you going to do?  Nice college boy.  You're going to get dirt alone.  You're going to walk up, chew right on his balls. 
[01:56:30]  He wants to go up and eat his balls.  It's just business, and you're taking it very personal.  By the beep, by the boop, I eat his balls.  It's easy for you to say, Tom, they weren't your balls.  Or you won't see his balls no more.  I was as much a protective sack to him as you are, Sonny.  Take the balls, leave the cannolis.  Wow.  How are the balls on this place? 
[01:57:00]  Easiest to chew in this city.  You put in your balls, some wine, a little sugar.  And that's my trick.  Even in prison, Paulie Gais just sliced the balls very thin with a razor blade.  It was a very good system.  Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and bite the testicles of a man like Mo Green like that.  Good.  And there's not one fucking chick out there that gets any of these good...  Enjoy it, guys. 
[01:57:30]  What's that mean?  I didn't see that movie.  Exactly stupid.  Can't put balls in steel magnolias, can we?  The balls of Madison County.  The history of the traveling ball.  One of my little girls didn't like my balls, son.  She actually stole a pair of chimp teeth and tried to bite them off. 
[01:58:00]  She had to be corrected.  Ah, and when my wife tried to eat my balls, she too had to be corrected.  What's Steve writing down?  Steve?  What are you writing, Steve?  Steve's got a little note.  We have just let you know the girls are here.  A post-it.  Oh, the penthouse girls.  Yes, they just walked in the door from the penthouse club.  What are they doing today?  Um, they are going to be... 
[01:58:30]  Entertain them for a while, Steve.  Get on a little bicycle.  Ride it around and juggle.  Grab the cymbals.  Clang, clang, clang.  He's got like a little thing tied around his ankle so he can't run away or hurt the tourists.  And a muzzle.  That's what they do.  They nail their feet to the pedals.  Nail them.  Do they really?  They do secure their feet to the pedals so they don't get off the bikes.  I don't think it's with nails, is it?  No, no, well, I mean it's secured.  They strap them in.  Well, they have to.  Yeah.  Bear doesn't want to ride the bike.  Exactly.  He's not.  He wants to just put shit on the internet and... 
[01:59:00]  Jesus.  At unnavigatable websites.  Jesus, stop.  You know, his claws get in the way.  That's what happens.  Those big claws.  He's trying to type.  There's a salmon stuck to one.  I understand.  Oh, it's the fucking...  I love Foundry.  I put it in Norton.  Nothing was found under your search.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus.  Jesus.  You can't find anything under Norton.  That's awful.  Norton.  It's on the front page.  All right.  No, it's not.  There's fucking three caricatures and an ad for cunt shoes that you can bring to a campsite 
[01:59:30]  and drink.  What is that?  Links that you're looking for buried in the text of war and peace.  It's like, what the...  Well, just show me the link that says the picture you want to see.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I'm going to read disclaimers.  This is a pop-up window doesn't appear.  Go to another site.  No pop-ups.  No pop-ups at all.  The girls are going to show their boobs.  What's going on on your website, by the way?  There was a...  No one knows.  There was a failed attempt on assault on the media, right?  Yeah.  Buffalo Paul and a kid named...  Have you seen this yet? 
[02:00:00]  Failed attempt?  I have not seen it.  Failed attempt from Buffalo Paul.  And a kid named Chicken Shit Charlie, I guess they were doing.  They were bragging.  They were bragging that they were going to take the title for the best assault on the  media for the month of August, by the way.  Hardly.  They were setting this up for a long time.  What'd they do?  And they finally attacked and it was...  They went after...  They went after Channel 2...  I guess it's an NBC...  It's a CBS affiliate or NBC in Buffalo.  I don't know.  It's...  Thank you, Jim.  Very helpful.  And I guess Paul was off in the distance videotaping with his own video camera, telling 
[02:00:30]  him when to go when the guy was live.  And Charlie was running up on him.  And the cameraman from Channel 2 got wise to it and zoomed in on the reporter.  So all you heard was this guy screaming into a megaphone.  They had the whole thing set up.  It was going to be a megaphone attack.  You kind of hear the megaphone in the background.  Yeah, you kind of hear it.  But the way you hear it, it could have been edited in after the fact.  Oh, right.  So, you know.  The video is up on opandanthony.com and foundrymusic.com. 
[02:01:00]  It's not going to take the title.  The guy from Alabama is still in the lead.  That was a failed attempt.  The guy in the lion outfit.  The lion costume.  How about the air horn idea?  No one's using that.  That was a great one.  We haven't really talked about the assault on the media in a while.  But basically, the best one for the month of August will win a MiFi, a day in the studio  with the boys, and other fine prizes.  What are they?  It's just people continue on the bit that we were just doing.  All right.  Well, Sally has a godfather line. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, nice.  I thought ladies didn't watch this film.  Sally?  Oh, I've got all the quotes on my computer, but I'm thinking, oh, be sure you find somebody  to hide the balls right, because I don't want them coming out of the john with just a dick  in his hands.  That's a good one.  Like David from Patterson.  He was eating testicles two at a time.  Players couldn't get their faces bit at the table.  You bit my brother's balls.  And Ben just IM'd us and said, great prizes for the Assault on the Media Contest on the 
[02:02:00]  way.  All right.  Well, that really details it, doesn't it?  I'll tell you one thing.  Or no, it says, we are close to getting some great prizes for the Assault on the Media Contest.  That's why I like Ben.  He languages in...  I fucked up.  I was going to say he languishes, but I said he languages.  Asshole.  Languages.  Languishes in specifics.  So we'll see if anyone's going to take out Lion Guy from Alabama to win the prize for  the Best Assault on the Media for the month of August. 
[02:02:30]  Basically, you're getting our names on TV and shouting and using air horns.  Yeah, you see the live shots from the news out there all the time.  Just get behind him with a sign, ONA, Opie and Anthony, XM Radio, yell something.  Right.  Don't touch the reporters or anything, but just kind of, you know, distract them a bit.  All right.  Ben's raw ass.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  You guys are changing directions like crazy.  But I got to...  The chimp bit his balls off because they brought him a cake instead of chicken wings and watermelon.  Ugh.  Ugh.  You waited on the lines for that... 
[02:03:00]  Punching out.  Jeez.  All right.  Let's get to the chimp story.  Why can't we all work and play well together?  Chimp story.  Yes.  Let's get to it.  So the guy was released from the hospital.  Yeah, they just...  It's a big story today.  He...  That was a long time ago.  When did that actually happen?  Because they showed him being released and he still looked really fucked up.  I feel like we did that story like, God, six months ago maybe.  It was a while ago, right?  I guess when a chimp eats your balls, their recovery time is pretty long.  What do you think?  Get back to work in three days?  Like a band-aid over your bag? 
[02:03:30]  No.  Yeah, they're not.  Tape these up.  When a chimp's biting your balls, imagine it's not a ginger slicing.  He's just...  He probably grabs them and just chews until they're gone.  Nasty chimp teeth chewing and pulling.  Yeah.  He's probably got his fucking feet holding your legs so you can't pull away.  He's got you all wrapped up in some jujitsu hold.  He's a pro at it.  You know how hard it is to pull your balls out of a chimp's fucking chewing teeth?  That's got to be really unpleasant.  How awful to sit there. 
[02:04:00]  And you can't...  Sit down, watching a chimp eating your balls.  And he doesn't understand, look, I give up.  All right, you win.  You can't...  There's no reason...  All right, all right, I'll leave.  You can have the cake.  Yeah.  He's going to continue eating your balls.  Wasn't there no one there to help this man?  His old lady was there.  His old lady wife.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I wouldn't have helped him.  Please, if you see the chimp going for the balls, I'd back off.  Get out of there.  All right, fuck it.  Don't stay.  What are you going to do?  The gooch in Cleveland.  Gooch!  Dear chimp man, I hope your face grows back and you get new balls soon, your grandson Frank. 
[02:04:30]  What's this guy's name who got his balls bitten?  I don't know.  What is he?  We'll find out in the story here if we can ever play it.  Yeah, maybe we can play it.  They weren't going to see a chimp named Mikey.  You know a chimp named Mikey?  I did a pilot with one.  The guy was a big guy.  He was kind of like a heavy guy.  I saw him on the news.  He just looked familiar.  Yeah, he's a big old guy.  If they were going to see a chimp named Mikey, then I know these people.  Chimp testicles.  Let's see if Google.  Chimp bowling victim goes home. 
[02:05:00]  Ready?  St. James Davis and his wife made headlines after they adopted and raised a chimp named  Moe as if it was their own child.  But when they tried to celebrate Moe's birthday this year, a horrifying turn of events changed  their lives.  By horrifying, hysterical.  I am thankful that God and this hospital allowed St. James to come to me again.  We are not finished with our life together and our affection for each other. 
[02:05:30]  And with that, LaDonna Davis welcomed her husband home six months after he was attacked  by two chimpanzees while they visited their own chimp, Moe.  Moe was raised by the Davises since birth as one of the family, but he was removed from  their home in 1998 by animal control officers when he'd been a neighbor and a police officer  and attacked a police car.  A long legal battle ensued, and eventually Moe was taken to the Animal Haven Ranch.  The Davises visited him regularly until March when they came to celebrate his 39th birthday. 
[02:06:00]  After they gave Moe a birthday cupcake, two other chimps viciously attacked the couple,  biting off LaDonna's thumb and nearly killing St. James.  Okay, now they're getting started while we're on the phone.  What part of the body was bitten?  Face, back, his face is tore up really bad. 
[02:06:30]  His back is tore up.  Uh, legs, from what I saw.  They were just attacking him.  What about his balls?  Yeah.  Sending the ball squatting.  I hear that Moe, though, what he would do, every day he would tell the people it was his  birthday.  Even though it wasn't.  Awful.  And he didn't mean to bite the balls.  He just saw a blonde wig and assumed there was a vagina there.  The two attacking chimps were shot and killed by a worker at the Animal Sanctuary. 
[02:07:00]  St. James Davis has spent the past six months at Loma Linda Medical Center undergoing a series  of surgeries.  Today, he's back home.  Wait, Hawk, what was that note?  We did this March 8th.  Ah, at least we have a definite date.  We did this story March 8th.  Thank you.  Six months.  At least we get a definite date on it.  Thanks.  Good note, Hawk.  That could be.  That was a great note.  Let me tell you something, Eric. 
[02:07:30]  Considering that.  If you had to list notes, that could be the worst note anybody's ever written concerning  anything.  Do you understand why that was the worst note you've ever given me?  No, but that's all right.  Come on, I'm going to bite you right in a ball so you'll learn.  Chew his balls off.  Please.  You do realize in the story they said six months ago, right?  And Opie before that said, I think we did this story six months ago.  All right.  But as long as we have a concrete date.  Do you remember the time?  Could you look up exactly the hour and minute we had?  And I specifically said, was it rainy or was there sunny skies? 
[02:08:00]  Do you realize we stopped a bit just to do this now?  Yes, I do.  That's it.  All right.  Thank you, Speed Bump.  They also chewed off his foot, by the way.  They chewed off most of Davis' face, tore off his foot, tore it off, and his testicles  were chewed off.  Do you think they're going to attempt sex when he gets healthy? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  That's what she said.  Our relations will continue or whatever.  She'll go to kiss his mule and she'll just see the chew marks on his balls.  And she'll go, yeah.  They're going to have sex with his chewy ball sack.  Keith marks.  I bet you what they loved in sex is totally ruined, too.  I bet you he loved his balls, like, while she put her thumb in his ass, and they both  got to look at each other like, oh, well.  Time to get to know each other.  Maybe you like her to slightly nibble on his yam bag.  That's out now.  LaDonna Davis joins us from Los Angeles with her attorney and friend, Gloria Allred, who 
[02:09:00]  represented the Davises in their custody battle.  I thought she looked familiar.  Yeah.  LaDonna, I know you were excited about having your husband back home finally after more  than six months.  Tell us how he's doing this morning.  He has a good attitude, and to bring him home, I think, will help him emotionally to feel  that he wasn't going to have to stay in the hospital forever.  For a while, that was a touchy situation.  And so this, I believe, will bring him the ability to heal inside and outside a lot faster. 
[02:09:30]  Is it true what I read about that he's now having nightmares?  Yes.  In the beginning.  No shit.  Is it true?  Like, that's so wild.  He's having nice dreams about fluffy clouds.  Yeah.  Great.  He has a dream that he's in an opera, and he can't sing the right notes, so they send  a chimp out to help him.  Yeah.  You know how you have those dreams where you can't get the job done? 
[02:10:00]  You know what I mean?  Like, if you're a DJ or whatever your profession is, you have those work dreams.  Those are the nightmares he's having.  Yeah, you've got to think there's a hot girl in his dream, and he just can't get the job  done over and over again all night long.  He rolls over to the wife going, you had to adopt a chimp.  A chimp.  A fucking chimp.  He has this dream that he's stuck in a library, and the only thing in there is Curious George  books.  That was a problem.  When they went to the birthday party, he was wearing a yellow hat. 
[02:10:30]  The guy from the book.  Let's say hi to Zach and Boston.  Two chimps.  They worked as a team.  One gets the face, one gets the ball.  How do you stop that?  Who do you yell, cut it out to first?  Zach, what's up?  Jumping on the police car.  Hey, you sit up here, up here in the Sierra Mountains with your chewed up, your chewed  up testicles.  Oh, wow.  He was trying to do a godfather reference, and he just stumbled.  And I interrupted everyone to go to that phone call.  He stumbled through that.  Oh, that was really awful.  Lou, whackbag.com. 
[02:11:00]  The chimps get balls.  The chimps get balls.  Oh, horrible Paul Anka impression.  Oh, it's not that.  Scott in Tennessee.  Hey, guys.  Happy birthday, Jim.  Thank you, man.  I want to start a message board where we get to comment about the listeners and how awful  they are on a daily basis.  This guy?  No.  This guy is going to make a brilliant point.  All right.  Let's go to Scott in Tennessee.  Help us out, Scott.  The listeners are failing today. 
[02:11:30]  Are you there?  Yeah.  Hey, did I hear Jimmy say he shot a fucking pilot with a chimp, and you guys let it go?  What the hell?  Exactly.  What are we, insane?  You shot a pilot with a chimp.  Well, it was a long two years, boys.  What was the pilot about?  I think I shot five MTV pilots.  It was about the bottom of his group.  Yeah.  It was, yeah, the monkey was just, I shot a pilot.  It was called Most Useless Teen, and it actually could have been. 
[02:12:00]  The same guy that did Insomniac, it was creatively behind it.  It actually could have been good.  But MTV has a tendency to micromanage occasionally.  What was the premise?  How was the chimp utilized?  I was the guy who was kind of running this camp for teenagers.  We had to find who was the most useless one, which could have been pretty funny because  they weren't supposed to know what the contest was.  They were being determined how useless they were.  Right.  A reality show with a twist.  Yeah, exactly, which is kind of an original thing.  Yeah.  But MTV kind of stepped in, and again, they made it. 
[02:12:30]  You have to keep saying useless teens, and they just kind of wrecked it a little bit.  They said, Jimmy, we like you, but you look too much like the chimp.  No, he actually liked me very much.  The lady said she never saw him bond with somebody so fast.  We hung out.  Yeah, he was very good.  You did?  You hung out with the chimp and everything?  He loved me.  Yeah.  They said the way he gets to know you is I have pictures with him.  They said he actually, the first thing he does, because I had to hold his hand.  They didn't have a suitcase full of glass dildos, did it? 
[02:13:00]  First thing.  I had to hold his hand and walk him up in one of the scenes and introduce him that he  was going to be a housemate.  That's adorable.  But the way he bonds with you is he's got diapers on.  He'll sit on your foot and kind of like rot.  You have to like, you know, lift your foot up like you're tapping.  Masturbate on your foot?  No, no.  There's no load involved.  He's a little fella.  I love how he's trying to justify this.  I'm telling you what happened.  I know, he's making it sound like Seinfeld.  Yeah.  During the creative process.  I have respect for you, Jimmy.  I still love you, bro.  Thank you.  The chimp was a writer. 
[02:13:30]  The chimp loved me.  Did he?  He loved me.  Oh, he was cute, man.  You can't not like the chimp.  And at the drop of a hat, he would have eaten your balls.  Two seconds would have bit me.  That's it.  Was he a young chimp, though?  Not one of those old, like, Mr. Chips kind of old gray fucking lip is hanging down to  his knees chimp?  No, I think he was a chimp.  I'm not sure what he was.  Weren't it worse than a chimp with Parkinson's?  Shaking.  Peels his banana, goes flying off.  It's like Frankie.  Crotchety old chimp.  Yeah, and I can't skate anymore. 
[02:14:00]  Put on his dopey roller skates.  He keeps falling over.  The kids parties, the kids are throwing stuff at him.  Has to have somebody blend his testicles in a blender first before he can eat them.  I was close to fucking that one.  He was like, you could blend twice.  Yeah.  I used blend twice.  Thank God the punchline was strong enough to cover that up.  I got to hold him and carry him around.  Yeah?  Put his little arms around me.  That's adorable. 
[02:14:30]  He was very cute.  Yeah, chimps are cute.  Did they put him in a little engineer outfit?  Like a chimp in little coveralls with an engineer cap on.  He did actually.  I got pictures like that.  Really?  Yeah, I'll show them to you.  Because it's tested and proven there is nothing more adorable.  Than a chimp in an engineer outfit?  In an engineer outfit.  Like he's going to drive the fucking train.  I know.  Dress him up like he's going to drive a train.  Meanwhile, he's fucking opening the back, throwing his shit at everybody, having a laugh.  Here, hold this in your mouth.  I always got bonded with the chimp very much, though.  I hated when he had to leave. 
[02:15:00]  I felt sad when he had to leave.  Yeah.  Devin from New Hampshire.  He's a good boy.  Did Jimmy drive an 18-wheeler around and get in fights in biker bars?  Tell him no.  I'm not fucking Greg Evigan.  All right.  We have to say how to Rich in Philly.  BJ and the Bear.  That's about fucking a monkey and Steve.  Yo, guys.  The guy having a nightmare.  Do you think he had a nightmare that he was Reginald Benny?  Hit the water, hit the water, hit the water.  Wow.  Guys are brutal.  Back to the chimp story. 
[02:15:30]  Side and outside a lot faster.  Is it true what I read about that he's now having nightmares?  Yes.  In the beginning, he had tremendous nightmares, and I was staying at the hospital until 1, 2, 3 in the morning.  And his long-term memory came back.  Why doesn't you do the follow-up?  What were the nightmares?  Yeah.  How interesting would that be if you were watching?  What are the nightmares?  What goes through your head at night when you're dreaming?  He came back quickly.  His short-term memory took a while. 
[02:16:00]  Gloria, you've been by the side of the Davises for quite some time.  You've represented them in their custody battle to get their chimp, Mo, back.  You were there for the homecoming.  What was it like?  Very, very emotional.  And, I mean, St. James was crying.  LaDonna was crying.  And I really, Robin, want to give such enormous credit.  Not only to the strong will to live and the fighting spirit of St. James, but also to LaDonna, his wife.  The power of love that this couple have for each other has really helped him to have the will to live and I think is a very significant factor in his recovery. 
[02:16:30]  They're just remarkable people.  Can you help people understand the bond that they have with Mo?  Well, Mo was like their child in many ways.  They didn't have children and they were a family.  And I want to make it clear that he certainly was innocent in this attack on Mr. Davis. 
[02:17:00]  That it was two other male-driven Jews who got out of their habitat because some doors were left open.  It was human error.  I'm going to eat your testicles, Mo.  I'm warning you, don't make me eat your testicles.  Hey, I'm warning you.  Ah, testicles!  Mo, the chimp is innocent in all this, these shenanigans.  Some doors were left open. 
[02:17:30]  It was human error in part.  And that's why Mr. Davis suffered the terrible attack that he did.  And she did, too.  She also, Ms. Davis, lost a thumb and despite the fact that she's also a victim...  Yes, they're even.  How are you doing?  Walk it off.  She saves on nail polish.  He's got no balls.  Fair trade.  I can never wear gloves again.  What?  She's got to tape the inside of that one oven mitt. 
[02:18:00]  Tape it down.  So it doesn't flop around and mock her.  Her husband.  How are you doing emotionally, LaDonna?  It's a challenge.  And I have to say that once in a while I get a little angry.  But you have to let that go because if you don't let that go, you don't go forward.  And we need to go forward.  I need to make the best for my husband, St. James, that I can do.  And by going forward and looking to the better of things, that's what's going to get him there. 
[02:18:30]  And it appears that St. James tried to protect his wife in the attack and took the brunt of the attack on himself in order to protect her.  So he's a real hero in this.  Gloria Allred, LaDonna Davis, thank you very much.  All the best.  And please know that our thoughts are with St. James right now this morning.  Thank you both.  Thank you, Rob.  I guess a welcome home gift for the Planet of the Apes box set is out of the question.  Did he get his balls back or did he probably swallow them up? 
[02:19:00]  No, you don't get balls back from a chimp.  That's true.  When a chimp mauls your balls, they're probably unsameable.  They're gone for good.  He's got ping pong balls.  Fucking thumb and two balls.  Chimps are rough.  And a foot.  And a foot.  He's got his foot, too.  The whole foot's gone, too.  His foot got ripped off?  Yeah, ripped his foot off.  Chewed his face and his testicle.  By the way, a lot of people checking in.  And balls were pulled off, not chewed off.  Oh, much better.  I'm sure they were pulling and chewing.  Did you ever see a chimp go with something?  The chimps have those teeth that are made for, you know, eating, like, plants and stuff. 
[02:19:30]  No, they got the big canines.  Big fangs.  You think they start tearing with those things?  Yeah.  He had pants on.  He wasn't wearing a skirt.  Yeah.  He had to get through his pants.  I think they unzipped them slowly.  Lift, lift.  Lift your ass up off the ground.  And he pulled his foot off?  Yeah.  How do you not just go back to that place with a fucking rifle and just kill?  Well, they killed the two chimps that were responsible.  Did they?  Yeah.  They shot them.  But, yeah, I'd be on some kind of vendetta of all chimpanzees must die, must get their 
[02:20:00]  balls ripped off, their little chimp balls.  That's a rough, that's a rough thing to come back from.  His foot, there's, like, not the fucking top, the middle, and the bottom of his body, they  just attacked.  Yeah.  There's not one place on him they kind of left alone.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Mr. Hughes from whackbag.com.  Mr. Underscore Hughes, yes.  Uh, I heard that, uh, Angel Tits there sent the guy a card and some flowers, and the inscription  read, good luck, bro.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Card crack. 
[02:20:30]  Oh.  That's not Jimmy's thing.  Yeah.  Or it might have worked.  All right.  Quick break.  Adam Pryor in studio, playing Caroline's next Thursday through Sunday.  When we get back, Anthony, one of our favorite things to do, news teases.  Love it.  How the news scares the shit out of you, Adam.  Oh, yeah.  We have some great examples.  And, uh, we'll bring the broads in as well.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus. 
[02:21:00]  How can I honestly say anybody rips me off?  When I hear the same exact bits done, that's how I say it.  I mean, what about wow?  That's totally their idea.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  There's something new.  Well, and then, uh.  There's something new.  You know what?  I used to do that in Washington, D.C.  Tell them, Fred.  I used to have people tie bandanas around their cars so that women would take their clothes off in the cars.  Dude, get with it.  All right, well, I mean.  Give me an original idea.  Come on.  I mean, I know.  I know.  I used to have my listeners tie a bandana around their cars.  I mean, I've done it all. 
[02:21:30]  What about going off on my head?  I totally know that's you.  All right.  Okay, whatever.  I got to go.  Please, I don't really want to get into a discussion like this.  He's so delusional.  That is really funny.  Someone found the clip.  Yeah, that's something we couldn't play on the old show because of the gag order that he placed on us.  How do you tie a bandana around your car?  That's a great one.  That's a big bandana.  What's the matter?  My car has cancer.  People throwing Frisbees to their cars, jumping, grabbing. 
[02:22:00]  God, just showing your age, man.  You can't even tie bandanas to antennas anymore.  It's all hippied out.  You honk the horn.  Like, beep, beep.  Dude.  Oh, dude.  He's so delusional.  Oh, man.  Just admit it.  My bandana.  Wow, it's such an original idea.  I invented everything.  I've done it all.  He even said, I've done it all.  Wow.  Even the stuff that's going to be invented, I did already.  There's no real idea.  I went into a time machine and I already did it. 
[02:22:30]  Killed himself.  Right.  I've done it all.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  I was the first one to do anything.  Crap.  Marconi ripped me off, Robin.  Remember the, what was that thing called?  Dot, dot, dash, dash, dot Morse code.  It was Howard code earlier.  The guy ripped me off.  I invented SOS.  Hoo-hoo-hoo, Robin.  What a complete jackass.  He's the guy.  Wow.  Wow.  He invented wow.  And it had nothing to do with whip him out Wednesday. 
[02:23:00]  Wow, it was tying a bandana around your car.  Thank you, Howard.  And what were we supposed to do if you saw, like, something?  I don't know.  He didn't really explain it very well.  Of course he's not going to explain.  If someone had a bandana tied around their car somehow, girls would get naked in the car?  It wasn't even flat.  Girls would get naked.  They're driving, taking their clothes off, crashing into a button.  Mr. Robin.  I invented traffic accidents.  A bandana around an antenna that reminds me of something else I've heard. 
[02:23:30]  It's called a fucking flag.  That's not exactly somebody's fucking invention.  I invented that, Robin.  They say Betsy Ross did that.  I sewed the stars on.  Hoo-hoo, it was all me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  I don't care.  I invented that.  I invented that.  Scooby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Scooby, we are all on charge, yeah.  Never get it now.  We are all on charge, yeah. 
[02:24:00]  Give me some of that stuff.  Not a bad idea, right?  Right.  All right.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday on the O.P. and Anthony Show today.  Get a wow on your car.  There's ladies that will flash you.  It's been happening for years.  Years and years and years.  Adam Farrar in studio.  Playing at Caroline's next Thursday through Sunday. 
[02:24:30]  25th through the 28th.  And who's this monster?  I met him once.  Yeah, you know Gavin from England.  Gavin, right, from England.  You've got to grab a mic, Gavin.  You've got to give the visual for everyone out there.  Jesus Christ.  How tall are you?  I'm like 6'5".  6'5".  290.  290.  Wow.  He's 290.  He's got a clock on his head.  You are giant.  Yeah, he's a big fella.  Yeah.  You're like a bouncer and stuff, right?  And security and all that?  Yeah, doing all that shit, yeah.  Yeah.  Here or there?  All over. 
[02:25:00]  All over.  All over.  Yeah.  Doesn't matter.  You'll kick ass anywhere around the world, right?  I've got to tell you, there are so many people that show up every day just to hang and check  out the show.  Friends of people.  I don't know, fans that hang out outside all night.  We say, all right, come on in and check out the show.  And most people you never even hear on mic.  They're just there kind of checking it out.  We say hi after the show and we go about our lives.  But every once in a while, people that are coming down just to hang become part of the  show.  And Gavin is part of the show because I walk in the studio from a leak break and everyone's 
[02:25:30]  checking out this sick video that's on your cell phone.  The things we do back home.  So now we have to talk about it a little bit.  Explain what this fantastic video is.  Well, it's basically me and my couple of buddies went to a swingers party in England.  And my friend ended up getting banged up the ass with a strap-on dildo.  Your friend got banged up the ass with a strap-on.  Wait, you guys just go to a swingers party? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, that's the kind of thing we do, you know.  Instead of getting bummed, we thought we'd go to a little party and get bummed ourselves.  Had he ever gotten...  I can't confirm that.  You don't know if he's gotten it in the ass before?  I don't think so.  Not from the screens.  No.  Why would you decide that not from the screens?  Yeah, this guy lets out some howls.  Well, the thing is, it's a dominatrix, and she's got a strap-on.  That's correct.  And she's the one that's screwing him in the ass with a strap-on.  There you go.  But behind her is somebody. 
[02:26:30]  There you go.  That's fucking her.  There you go.  So with every thrust the guy does to her, she's doing a thrust with his strap-on,  so she can't be very gentle to this guy.  And this guy is just, ah, like getting hammered, and it sounds painful.  And Gavin's just filming the whole thing on his cell phone.  And you hear Gavin laughing.  You can hear you laughing like an idiot.  And I'm watching the video, and I see the girl in the middle, and I had to blurt out,  she's the lucky one.  Yeah, where did this slob come from? 
[02:27:00]  It was all down in London about two months ago.  Yeah, and she was just at the swing of a party?  She was just at a party, yeah, and she just decided to come back with us to the hotel.  She had like a box of toys to display things with us as well.  So I've got a little shit on here as well that I can show you.  You know, if there's a chick, and she comes back to the hotel, and she's got a box of toys,  the last thing I'm thinking is, hey, could you strap that on and put it up my ass?  That's the last thing I was thinking as well.  How do you get to that point?  You guys are all hanging in the hotel room.  Were you drunk? 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, we was all drunk, and it's a filthy weekend.  I've been drunk.  Yeah, that is no excuse.  Like, did you have any inkling that he might enjoy something like this?  No, he actually volunteered for it, you know.  He was like, what are we going to do with this?  Oh, you know what?  I'll get fucked in the ass with this, no problem.  Who wants it in the ass?  Right here.  Me.  Volunteers.  All right, why don't we listen to a little of it?  Let's see if I can get it on the...  What, I'll just put it to the mug door?  Yeah, we'll all be quiet and listen in on the audio at least. 
[02:28:00]  It's got to be to the front.  Yeah, the mug.  Do the front.  Like that?  Yeah, put it right against it.  Oh, shit.  Put it on.  Maybe I'll...  You open that window, it's a little bit.  It's a little bit more, that's a little bit.  That's it, that's it.  There you go.  Well, well...  Is this the negotiation going on? 
[02:28:30]  I like the prelim, Mrs. Guilford.  Because calling her by her first name would be rude.  Poor English of us. 
[02:29:00]  He's having a hard time with it.  It's a big deal though, man.  It's good, brother.  Oh, my fucking god.  Why was it nice on the earth?  Just make my fucking eyes zelfs.  Oh, that's Kevin laughing, you sick effer. 
[02:29:30]  Get me a towel, cause if he's covered in shit, I don't know what it is.  Get me a towel, it's covered in shit.  I was nearly there then.  See how many, it's his first time you can tell. 
[02:30:00]  Get in there and give it a good ride.  It's too late. 
[02:30:30]  Get in there, get in there, get in there.  Get in there, get in there.  Good luck, good luck, that's what I'm talking about.  That's what I'm talking about.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, fucking hell. 
[02:31:00]  That's a good one.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, my God.  That guy is not comfortable with that situation.  What's worse than being raped in the ass and hurting when your friend laughing at you and filming it?  Just cackling.  Fucking hell!  This is what Isaac's like in the morning as well.  I mean, God, girl's a hero.  She's a real trooper.  Give me a towel in case there's shit on it. 
[02:31:30]  Shit on it.  Practical gal.  Yeah, that's what he sounded like.  Hey, Nate.  Eight is bald.  Morning, guys.  What's up, Nate?  Yeah, I know we're not playing, but on the gay or funny scale, this is most certainly gay.  It's gay and funny.  It's gay and funny, yes.  Over and out, guys.  All right.  All right.  Wow.  Well, Gavin, thank you.  You're welcome. 
[02:32:00]  The accent kind of gives a little air of dignity.  Yeah, doesn't it?  No matter what the English are doing.  No matter how perverse the English are being, it's done in that accent.  It's just something charming about it.  When he wrote Strawberry Fields, Paul fucked me in the air.  Yes, make sure I'm putting it in his bum.  That guy was a fucking trooper.  Wow.  How was he?  Did you drive him home?  Oh, yeah, he could walk.  He could walk.  Yeah, he's a trooper.  Face first in the backseat, crying.  His fucking face.  Ice cubes in his ass. 
[02:32:30]  Horrible.  Let's say hi to Donna in Jersey.  Donna, what's up?  Hey, guys.  You'd be surprised how many guys who claim to be straight actually want to get fucked  in the ass with a strap on.  I saw one on a phone.  No.  We've gone down this road on the show, and a lot of guys will call in and say, hey,  it's not gay.  It's not gay.  It's like it's been done to me, and I'm not gay. 
[02:33:00]  It depends on what you do.  I never did it.  I had a dominatrix rub one against my crack for a second, and I didn't let her put it  in because I didn't want it in.  She was sexy, though.  Rub it against your crack.  Yeah, then she spit on me.  I come in contact with a lot of single, straight guys who claim to be straight, and after  the first couple, after the first contact, then they kind of like gently broach the subject  of, hey, how'd you like to fuck me in the ass with a strap on?  That's gently.  You big, macho guys.  Donna, yeah, that's really subtle of them.  Then they gently.  I don't know how you figured out what they wanted with a tap dancing that way. 
[02:33:30]  Hey, are you a dom?  No.  Then how do you come in contact with all these guys?  She's a slut.  That's the thing.  That's what I'm trying to get across.  It's more mainstream than you think.  Like if you're on a mainstream dating site, or if you're kind of just, you know, normal  plain vanilla sex, not really freaky, not hanging out in, you know, dungeons and things  like that, it's becoming more and more common for a guy to be open to that.  How many guys have you banged with a dildo?  And what side are you on? 
[02:34:00]  None.  I swear to God, none.  I can't bring myself to do it.  Really?  Really.  What kind of a friend are you?  Guy asked you to fuck him in the ass.  You don't even have the God damn common courtesy you strapped one on.  Selfish.  I'll be watching you.  Yeah, I can't bring myself to do it.  Jesus.  All right, Donna.  Thank you.  Witter.  Good for nothing.  Oh, here they come.  Bill, what's up?  Yep.  You've got a new trend there.  What's up, boys?  Thanks for this segment, Gavin.  You're welcome.  You can come back any time.  Yeah, go ahead, Bill.  Yeah, yeah.  I had a friend of mine who I used to work with and she was engaged to this guy. 
[02:34:30]  She was having this kid and she fucked him in the ass one time with a dildo and every  time he wanted it after that.  Every fucking time until she split up with him.  That was it.  Really?  Yeah, she said it was too freaky.  Yeah.  That is too freaky.  Once in a while with a thin one, maybe colorable.  Like a little foam one?  Yeah, a little small one.  A little teeny one.  It's just kind of like, you know, get you.  You're like, ah, come on.  Oh, come on, sneaky.  Yeah, you'll probably be out there.  Nat from Jersey saying that audio is from the latest James Toback film. 
[02:35:00]  Easy.  Let's say hi to Trent in Utah.  Trent.  Hello.  Hey.  That is some funny shit there.  Yeah.  You ever had it up the ass?  We answered that.  I mean, what kind of radio is this?  It's just five heads nodding.  Yes, yes, yes.  Silent we all are.  The interesting thing, two people nodded their heads and it's up to you to figure it  out.  All right.  Thank you, Trent.  Let's go to Donahue from whackbag.com. 
[02:35:30]  Donahue.  Hello, Bill.  I have a question for our little buddy, Jimmy Norton.  Is it okay for that guy to go and make eye contact now or is that gay?  He's not gay because she's a chick.  Ah, okay.  Well, doesn't the dick make it gay?  No, dude.  It's that chick thing.  Oh, all right.  As long as you're not doing it, your motives will count.  Gavin, is your friend gay?  Not at all.  Fuck on it.  He is now.  He's an absolute major man.  Some guys are just submissive.  That's the way it is.  Did he at least have the common courtesy to give him a reach around?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's banged her enough times. 
[02:36:00]  Don't worry about that.  He's popped that many women in his lifetime.  He's not even caring anymore.  He just wants to do other things.  Oh, it's back at that point where he's had sex with so many women.  He's just doing other things now, yeah.  Yeah.  Sometimes.  Try anything.  Suck a cock.  I don't know about that.  He's still hit a row.  Yeah, it's another level.  As long as it's just one.  Never.  All right.  News teases?  Yeah, let's get into the news tease as we screen the phone calls for the good stories.  Don't worry.  Of course.  We'll stay down this road for a while.  You didn't get coffee from Starbucks?  What are you drinking? 
[02:36:30]  That looks good, Hope.  Starbucks?  Yeah.  Want me to buy you some?  I don't know.  Looks delicious.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  You know that, Jimmy?  That's a lot of people here.  Don't be scared.  Don't be scared, Jimmy.  There's cameras.  Put on your diaper right on my foot.  Come on.  I'm going to try.  I'm going to try again.  Go ahead.  Give it a shot.  Please, God.  Let him do shit.  There you go.  I swear, I was walking home yesterday.  I never come so close to shitting my pants.  I was a half block from home.  You know how you have them blocked up and the gas just starts kind of fumbling out? 
[02:37:00]  Not solid ones, but just...  I pushed one out and there was a sneaky fucking batch right behind it.  I tried to follow it in to the club.  I was maybe one fucking cheek press away from fucking having shit run out of the bottom of my pant leg.  What's that supposed to be?  Kind of sick joke?  Try to get your head and your ass live together or I will take a giant shit on you.  Dude, it was brutal.  Yeah, it's very obvious that we're turning into Imus. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  Oh, that stupid...  You know what?  Holy shit, we haven't even brought this up yet.  That threat on the New York radio message board?  Yeah.  It's obvious the guys are turning into Imus.  Imus used to be a shock jock and then went down the road of politics and it's obvious that Opie and Anthony are following suit.  Jimmy, it's the guy.  He's doing the guy.  I love the guy.  And I know it's the guy that can only certain fingers come out to type.  Holy shit.  It's never accurate typing.  It's the one finger typing.  Every day, people have something stupid to say about this radio show. 
[02:38:00]  The latest is because we had a political debate, I guess, with Marc Maron yesterday, which was very interesting radio.  Jimmy and Anthony going at it with Marc Maron and it was very interesting, you know.  And now a whole threat on this stupid New York radio message board.  I thought Alan Sniffen, who runs the board, was a little smarter than that.  No.  But he's like, it's obvious that these guys are going to do what Imus did and get away from the shocking stuff and do like a political radio show.  It was one break.  His whole take is that it's not what XM expects. 
[02:38:30]  They hired us to do shocking radio.  And if we don't do the shocking radio, we're not going to bring in the new listeners that they were expecting and it will fail miserably.  He doesn't know what he's talking about.  So the London butt-fucking on the phone is considered politics.  There you go.  You know, like, that's the type of thing that Logan will call after.  Right.  And go, dude, that was fucking great.  I love that when you guys have some kind of balance like that.  I know.  That's why he doesn't have a clue about what XM is looking for.  What the show is about.  What the show was about.  What it is now.  How similar it is to what it used to be. 
[02:39:00]  Eh, it's just the way it is.  And that thread started with a guy saying, hey, it was a great debate.  Right.  I'd love to hear.  Because, you know, Maron's a smart guy, man.  He's capable of defending his point.  It was very interesting, you know?  Yeah.  And one of our listeners said, don't you worry, Alan.  They'll be back to, you know, whatever, fart jokes tomorrow.  Yeah.  That's how it works.  I was talking to Brother Weez about it.  He goes, you guys got to fill up a lot of time because you're not on commercial radio anymore.  That's another thing.  We got four hours.  A four-hour show on satellite is a four-hour show.  Do you realize out of the four hours, we're talking for three hours and 40 minutes, 
[02:39:30]  more or less, a day?  Yeah.  Commercial radio, a four-hour show is 20, 40, 80 minutes after that, minus.  So, what, two hours and 40 minutes?  Something like that, yeah.  An extra hour of material.  So, we're doing an extra hour of material a day.  And Weez is like, you guys should throw all that shit out there.  You get, do a little politics, do the fart stuff, do the sex stuff, do the shocking  stuff.  Yeah.  Lifestyle.  He goes, just throw it all in the mix.  Who cares?  He doesn't seem to get that, though.  He just likes to be the guy who's the voice of reason and who says, like, the really, 
[02:40:00]  like, poignant thing.  And the bottom line is the thread was a positive one.  Hey, that was really interesting.  And he's got to jump in and go, well, you know, I think that it's, you know, it's not  what XM paid the point.  It is.  If he presented it as opinion, it's one thing.  But he presents it like this is the way it is.  And anyone who tries to argue it, I've never seen him turn around on a subject.  You lost that one, Alan.  I read the, is the thread still up?  No, he got rid of it.  You know why he got rid of it?  It wasn't a bad Opie and Anthony thread at all.  He lost the argument. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  And that's why he took it down.  Or he should have, if there was a really awful post, he could have taken them.  But that was not, I read the whole thread.  I like 16 of them.  Yeah.  He was losing that debate.  Mm-hmm.  You were losing the debate.  Because people were going, well, look, Norton still talks about hookers and fecal matter  and this and that and all these rotten things that we talk about, these barbaric  things.  Yeah, one guy listed all the stuff, like, don't you worry, Alan.  Yeah.  They did this, this, this, and this.  I wish I had it, but he got rid of the thread.  It was, it was some good reading.  But it was, it was like, it was like, and so they do something like this or the Dick  Cavett interview. 
[02:41:00]  So what?  You want an hour of commercials or an hour of Dick Cavett?  You know, the fucking guy's a legend.  We interviewed him.  Yes.  It was fun.  I had fun with the Dick Cavett thing, dude.  It was great.  You liked the dick yesterday?  Easy.  It was nice.  Let's say hi to George.  What's up, George?  You got to stop reading this stuff, Bobby.  These guys don't know shit.  It's upsetting you too much.  Nah.  It's not that it upsets me.  Maybe to a point, sure.  I'm only human.  But I think it makes for interesting discussions on the show.  That's for sure.  You're the expert.  You're the radio pioneer. 
[02:41:30]  These guys don't know shit.  Why don't we get sniffing on the phone?  Can we do that just to ask him what he meant?  Why he took the post?  Don't waste your time!  No, he's not right.  I think it makes for interesting radio to see how we're perceived out there.  On a daily basis, it's something, some stupid thing somebody's saying.  They said we won the last three or four months on satellite radio.  They said we were failing.  You guys are awesome.  They're full of shit.  But, dude, if it was all perversion and stuff, they'd complain about that.  The fact is, if it was all sex, they'd go, you know, these guys don't have any balance.  And then you put balance in and they're like, oh, well, you know, that's not what your listeners are looking for. 
[02:42:00]  Our listeners are not just fucking total retards.  They do like other things besides just tit jokes.  Right.  A couple of them.  You're never going to make them happy.  We're known for the shocking stuff, but the reality is, even on commercial radio, if you separate the shocking stuff with everything else we did, it's not a balanced scale.  No.  At all.  To me, the jokes have to be stronger on satellite.  Because back on commercial radio, hey, I effed her in the A, was funny because it was naughty.  But if you said, like, just say it loud, I fucked her in the ass, no one cares. 
[02:42:30]  You better have something funnier than that to back it up.  Right.  I think we do.  I'm on the cell phone again.  That's right.  It's fuck him in the ass, fella.  Take that.  Take that.  I was reading this stuff last night, just shaking my head like, people that are supposed to get it just don't get it.  Obviously, we'll go and do something stupid the next day.  That's the beauty of the show.  You never know what you're going to hear when you tune in.  And those three people on the cell phone were from the House of Parliament.  So it has both.  There you go.  It was silly though.  He just, Alan was losing that debate.  He did not get it. 
[02:43:00]  And he was wrong.  Right.  It was just like, I'm on the show and I'm reading this and I'm going, dude, you don't know what you're talking about.  I was going to say, when XM hired him for it, Logan calls after segments like that.  Guys, that's great.  Because it's not just fucking 18 year olds listening to the show.  You get some 40 year olds, some 30, whatever.  Yeah.  Now, why is that so hard for people to understand?  They just want to talk shit.  They want to have something to say that makes them different from the pack.  Like, whoa, he's the guy that sees.  Yeah.  Wrong.  Don't you worry.  We know what we're doing here.  We're going to just throw all that shit at you. 
[02:43:30]  Wrong fella.  Let's do news teases.  This is a new bit.  Nah, don't.  The listeners won't like it.  There's no dicks in it.  This is a new bit that we kind of created on satellite radio here.  We noticed the fear tactics that the news takes.  Oh, they love scaring us.  Basically, they tease you with a little thing and you have to wait for the end of the hour to find out what that was all about because you might be in danger.  Warning.  We've all heard these things.  And we're still trying to get the rest of the country involved, Anthony, and they're just not helping on this bit. 
[02:44:00]  No, they don't really get the bit.  But they love the bit.  Yeah.  But they can help us.  They love it.  Don't get it.  Watch your local news.  Roll tape.  And when you see one of these ridiculous news teases, tape it and send it in.  It's easy.  It's very easy.  So I think a lot of these are going to be from New York once again.  But we're the kings of scaring the crap out of people here in New York.  We love it because there's so many scary things in New York.  Where did Jimmy go?  You just left the studio again? 
[02:44:30]  I don't know.  Where'd he go?  I would love a job like that.  Why don't we just show Jimmy how it would be if we all just got up and left?  I'm trying to get Steve to get the audio off this phone.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, we should have that available.  Oh, very good.  Yeah.  You're producing the show.  We should have it.  A producer or the audio?  Both.  But I think if we had that and you wanted to go to like a particular clinic.  It's brilliant, Jimmy.  No, no.  That's my trip to Disneyland.  Let me get the audio off.  That's me and mom on the cruise. 
[02:45:00]  M-I-C-K-E-N.  Would your friend mind if this video made it up on a website that is seen by many, many  people?  I don't think he would, actually.  It's hard to tell, you know, the face out.  Yeah.  All right.  I don't mind.  I don't mind.  Yeah, you can't see him.  Because we're getting requests.  People want to see the video.  Let's start with the news thesis and see where this goes, Anthony.  Here's the first one today in the new batch.  Also, a nasty wreck shuts down a major highway perhaps near you.  Will it be open for the weekend?  Details next.  Perhaps near you. 
[02:45:30]  That's not so scary as it is just information you might need.  And then they want to lump everybody in so they go near you.  I disagree.  Why?  It could be your loved one in that crash is what I'm thinking.  Oh, is that what they're getting at?  That's why the, you know, perhaps near you, meaning the roadway that your loved one takes.  I missed it.  And, you know, now all the people that have husbands and wives that are a little late coming  home.  Very scary.  Oh, my God.  Was she in this thing?  Or he in this thing? 
[02:46:00]  And West Nile virus spreading in our area.  Find out where.  We'll tell you about it coming up next.  Yeah.  Motherfucker.  There's a better one, actually.  Spreading in our area.  We'll tell you where.  Why don't you just tell us?  Yeah.  And move on.  Spreading in, say, the neighborhood.  And it's so easy.  Spreading in...  Brooklyn.  Forest Hills.  Yeah, whatever.  Manhattan.  No.  The Bronx.  They want you.  They are using your fear to get you to tune in.  Somebody's mother has West Nile virus. 
[02:46:30]  Could be yours.  Could it be yours?  After this word from Levitt's Furniture.  Here's the next one.  Also coming up, the feds have launched an investigation into hundreds of thousands of  cars that have serious engine problems.  Is yours one of them?  God, these bastards.  These bastards.  It's all about trying to get you worked up.  I gotta hear that one again.  Also coming up, the feds have launched an investigation into hundreds of thousands of 
[02:47:00]  cars that have serious engine problems.  Is yours one of them?  Mmm.  You sure she's not talking about serious as in the radio?  Maybe the...  Whoever has one, the fucking weight, puts a little strain on your engine.  No.  Eh, no.  Eh, no.  They were keeping everyone involved though, obviously.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Holy crap.  Ugh.  You an angel.  Here's the next one.  Plus tonight, skin cancer concerns why you wanna make sure that you cover your kids 
[02:47:30]  with sunblock.  Your kids.  Always bring in the kids.  Very dangerous.  Yeah, that's not that bad, though, because they say cover them with sunblock.  That's like...  Yeah.  It's not as bad as if you eat solid food.  You could die tomorrow.  What can you put on your kids to prevent skin cancer?  Find out later.  At least they give you sunblock.  Yeah, that one isn't bad.  I think this next one's going to be bad, though.  They ransacked, robbed, and took off with a family car.  And these home invaders are still out there.  The details are coming up.  Uh-oh.  This is the same country you've got here.  Why? 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Oh, you don't get these news teasers in...  I can't believe what I'm hearing right now.  I'm on the other side of the pond.  No, the news is very stuffy over there.  What's your news?  A man took one in the ass for the first time.  It's on a cell phone.  We have the tape here.  All right.  Plus, where's it going?  Every time you swipe that credit card of yours, where's the information heading?  Find out who's getting that information.  Great.  Uh, the guy I just paid something to?  Right. 
[02:48:30]  Oh.  The phone off the hook.  What the hell is that?  That's what Ben hears in his head all day.  Yeah.  Don't, don't.  Plus, what you take for a headache could put you at risk for high blood pressure.  That's right.  Oh, can you believe this?  It's all about fear.

Actually, Nathaniel had a good point about that one.  He said, uh, if there are noisy bars in your area, wouldn't you already know about it?  So, true, you'd hear the noise.  Yeah, right.  That's true.  How to protect yourself from a new wave of Lyme disease in our area.  Let's look.  New wave Lyme.  These aren't as good as the ones we've had in the past.  Nah.  A couple of them are.

We don't want it to go away.  Yeah.  Well, we can save it for just the good ones.  We'll just do good ones.  Maybe we could pre-screen them one time.  Yeah, that would be nice if we would have listened to this before.  Yeah, maybe we can listen.  Maybe we should do some work before we actually get on the air.  Look, it's not every day an English guy is going to come in with a cell phone. 
[02:54:00]  Give us 20 minutes.  Yeah, that's the other problem.  We're trying to follow up what Gavin brought to the table with this?  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, it's a little rough.  You got the candles?  Yeah.  Let me see one of those.  Let's see these ridiculous items.  What a bunch of queers we look like.  Guy getting fucked in the ass with a dildo.  Now we're all going to do ear waxing.  Bunch of fat chicks.  Well, we're going to give the news teases one more shot before we retire it.  We're looking for those scary news teases.  There was a couple in there. 
[02:54:30]  Hey, Eric, where's those questions that Ben wrote for me to ask Cal Ripken Jr. that were on the desk?  Okay.  Those are really good, poignant questions.  I may throw it Kevin Kennedy when he calls in.  Why don't we bring the girls in?  We got girls courtesy of the Penthouse Executive Club, 603 West 45th Street, corner of 11th Avenue, right here in Manhattan.  The website is penthouseexecutiveclub.com.  It's not here.  And they have good steak.  Robert's Steakhouse is located in the club as well. 
[02:55:00]  Come on in, ladies.  And on the phone, we got Kevin Kennedy.  It's not here, right?  Kevin.  What's going on?  How are you, sir?  I'm good.  What are you guys up to?  I was listening to your show yesterday, actually.  You do a great job for XM.  Home plate, 175, right?  Yeah, we're having fun.  You and Rob?  Absolutely.  We got really, really hot ladies in the studio, Kevin.  Do you do this type of thing on your show?  No, I'm out of my house by myself in my little office. 
[02:55:30]  No, unfortunately.  But I do have direct TV, and I flip it around once in a while.  Wait, they built a studio for you?  Yes.  So you don't have to leave your house?  It's actually really nice.  Uh-oh.  Hey, I like the sound of that.  Very, very nice.  Uh-oh.  But, you know, I get out, and that's a whole other story.  But I work with a lot of female partners in sports and baseball.  Yeah.  One of them is no longer, however, but that's another story for my show.  Hey, one of the blondes, Kevin, is doing the universal sign of she's really, really warm, hot. 
[02:56:00]  It's too hot in here.  We need AC.  We need what?  What's your name?  Farrah.  Farrah?  Farrah.  The mic's not on there, Eric.  You would know that if you had headphones on.  Jesus.  Yeah?  It's on now?  Hello?  No.  No, it's not.  The mic is broken?  I'm so glad we tested the microphone before we started this.  Perish the thought.  We test the mic.  Holy crap.  One day.  Yeah, one day we'll get this all right. 
[02:56:30]  Wow.  Kevin, our goal is to one day do a professional-sounding radio show.  One day.  That's all we want to do.  And when we do that, then we're going to retire.  Kevin does it every day.  We did it in Las Vegas.  Yeah, yeah.  But that was, you know, the atmosphere.  It's Vegas.  We're talking about in your home studio doing a professional show.  We just can't seem to pull it off.  Hey, we had Cal Ripken on the show the other day.  How's Cal doing?  Great.  And we asked him the question. 
[02:57:00]  The one about...  He did?  Yep.  Did he answer?  Yeah.  Yeah, he answered.  Yeah, well, I didn't know.  And what's the truth of it?  There's no truth.  It was very uncomfortable because we were having a great interview with Cal Ripken and  then we all wanted to ask the question and we all were kind of looking at each other like  who's going to ask the question.  I wasn't very familiar with the Cal Ripken's wife, Kevin Costner story.  Yeah, I'm sure he's heard it. 
[02:57:30]  So I just blurted it out and asked him about it and he answered honestly.  That's interesting.  He had been friends with Kevin Costner for a while and he sat in the stands and watched  the game.  And Kevin is a big baseball fan.  He gets around.  He's really close with Roger Clemens, too.  I actually had Kevin sitting on the bench in Boston for the first two innings of the  game when he had his son with him and he was actually going through a divorce back in  1996.  It's kind of interesting. 
[02:58:00]  Boy, if that rumor was out, though, would you let Kevin Costner hang out with your wife?  I wasn't married at the time.  Like, even if it's just a rumor and everything, oh, it's fake, you'd still be like, eh.  Well, the rumor goes that Cal found, what, his wife in bed with Kevin Costner on the way  to the park or he went back to his house because he was in the house.  Yeah, back to the house.  And then mysteriously the lights went out in the ballpark that night because Cal wasn't  going to be able to play because he was taking care of personal business.  So they used the lights as an excuse.  So they used the lights as an excuse to keep the street going. 
[02:58:30]  Yes.  Exactly.  Yeah, he answered it.  He was pretty comfortable.  Yeah, he's cool.  And there's a website called Snopes.com and they said that story is false.  Yeah.  There's a lot of strange stories out there about different guys in baseball and that kind  of stuff.  Is there another good one that we've never heard?  Well, that's for another day. 
[02:59:00]  Have you guys heard about the one about Rafael Palmeiro?  Not the steroid one.  Oh, not the steroid one?  No, I'll let you guys do some homework on that one.  Oh, come on.  I heard his erections weren't very effective.  Really?  Viagra commercials.  Oh, right.  I heard you.  Yeah.  How bad do you need money?  How bad do you need money that you go on TV and promote Viagra or herpes cream or any  of that ridiculous stuff?  I did an olive gun commercial.  Yeah, but at least people aren't looking at you going, wow, look, the poor guy has herpes 
[02:59:30]  sores.  Hey, it's always the hot, hot, you know, girl on TV talking about her herpes and how  she cleared it up.  Hey, Kevin, we had Cal on the other day, but Ben, our producer, wrote some fantastic  questions, which were like, obviously, a real baseball expert.  So I wanted to ask you, we didn't ask Cal, but some of Ben's questions from the other  day, which were really good.  Oh, yeah.  And this is the first line of questions.  Who will win the AL East?  Looks like Boston now. 
[03:00:00]  Okay.  Because the next part of the question is, New York Yankees or Boston Red Sox?  This fucking sneaky idiot put fucking one question with two question marks to act like  he had two questions.  Two questions.  He's got nothing.  Okay, so you say, Boston, there's questions one and two in one answer.  All right.  Okay.  Ah, this one's a little change of pace.  One word answer, because I can make it really short.  Please do.  Who will win AL West? 
[03:00:30]  The Angels.  Los Angeles Angels or Oakland A's?  That fucking two question asking motherfucker, Ben, is hack.  That makes me sick.  All right.  Oh, here's another one, too.  Will Joe Torre be managing the Yankees next year?  No.  Oh, that's a good one.  You think it's an answer or no?  I would lean toward a no.  Okay.  All right. 
[03:01:00]  Farrah says yes.  Yeah.  This is a good one.  This is where he actually put two questions in one.  Who should be the National League slash American League MVP?  National League or American League MVP?  Yeah.  Oh.  I don't mean to get into such depth like this, but when Ben writes a bunch of questions out,  you've got to go with it.  So sorry to any people who aren't hardcore fans.  Either going to be Derek Lee or Albert Pujols.  And probably because St. Louis is winning, it's probably going to be Albert Pujols.  American League could be Manny Ramirez. 
[03:01:30]  Could be, if the Yankees get to the playoffs, could be Alex.  Could be A-Rod.  Here's a really – I'm sorry, go ahead.  Those are the top two candidates.  It could be Vladimir Guerrero again.  This is a good one, too.  This was a good one.  Go ahead.  Do you think Roger Clemens will return next year?  Of course.  Yeah.  He's got to get 350 wins now.  Yeah.  I am so frustrated watching Roger Clemens pitch this year.  These guys cannot get runs for him.  It is.  He's probably having the best year of his life, of his career. 
[03:02:00]  I talked to him Sunday.  Huh?  I talked to him just the other day.  I talked to him a couple days ago.  Why did they take him out of that game?  I was actually listening to that game on XM.  Basically, after the eighth inning, they took him out.  He only threw like 85 pitchers, which is nothing.  The pitch count was way low.  And the game was tied, I guess, 0-0 at that point.  They took him out going into the ninth inning.  He's got a little bit of a back problem now.  Oh, okay.  But hopefully he starts.  I think he should do the pitch tomorrow. 
[03:02:30]  I was yelling on my radio because I want to see this guy do good now.  Yeah, and it's unbelievable really what he's doing.  It's weird with me.  These players in all sports, I grew up despising them at first.  Roger Clemens was one of those guys.  And then these guys get older.  And for some reason, at the end of a lot of these guys' careers, you start rooting for them.  It's really strange.  And I want him to do well.  His ERA is ridiculous.  And if these guys were scoring runs, he would be having one of the best years ever.  Yeah, I feel the same way when a guy is doing that well this long into the season.  I want to see him keep putting zeros up there, break some kind of ERA title or something like that, 
[03:03:00]  at least going back to 1968 with Bob Gibson when he was like 1-1-6 or something like that.  So, yeah, he just turned 43.  I mean, it's pretty incredible what he's doing.  But, you know, what he told me is that he uses it as therapy.  He gets up and runs in the morning, does his workout, doesn't worry about what the offense is doing,  and just gets into, you know, aside from physically being prepared, mentally being prepared,  blocks everything out. 
[03:03:30]  That's why he can maintain what he's doing.  He's so good.  Yeah, he's an animal.  What about the – do you know anything about Derek Lowe and something with a Fox reporter?  Well, that's what I was going to talk.  That's the other one I was going to bring up.  I knew you guys had done your homework.  That's one of the girls I used to work with.  Oh, wow, that was one question Ben didn't think to ask.  Carolyn Hughes, yeah.  It's out there.  It's been on all the shows.  Wait, what's this about?  Apparently, Derek Lowe had an affair with a Fox reporter.  I worked with her for about two, two and a half years. 
[03:04:00]  Do we get a little more out of you there?  Yeah.  That's not a very good affair question.  I know.  I have to answer, Kevin.  Is that it?  I thought you'd give us a little more.  I can't just give you the whole thing.  I thought you'd give us a little more.  Yeah, I worked with her.  How many times do you have sex with her?  Well, she had EasyPass.  Can we smell your fingers?  I mean, give us something.  Jesus.  Carolyn went to Boston College.  She worked her main job before she came to Fox a few years ago was in El Paso.  She did a morning show, like the Good Morning America type show, local in El Paso, Texas. 
[03:04:30]  I don't know how she got into sports from there, but she came to Fox West, which is a Fox regional show.  She covers all the sports in Southern California.  Right.  Covered, I should say.  And Dodgers, Angels, USC football, you know, UCLA, you know, all the Southern California teams.  But then she got a job with me.  I decided to do the Dodgers pregame show. 
[03:05:00]  She was my co-host on that last year.  Did a pretty good job.  Kevin, I actually, you know, we go up and sit in the press box during a game because we do a postgame show as well.  And I actually taught her baseball.  I teach her how to score a game and this and that and all the ins and outs and the verbiage of baseball, things like that.  She must have been really hot, Kevin.  Yeah.  She must have been really hot to have that type of patience.  She's very good looking.  Absolutely.  She is.  K-mean strikeouts. 
[03:05:30]  Sit on my lap.  She's really credible.  And then the irony of it is that she, where Faulkner Staples Center is downtown, where the Dodgers, where the Lakers play,  there's a restaurant across the street that a lot of times before you go to work at 10 o'clock at night, you go in there and you have dinner.  And she met a guy two years ago or two and a half years ago, whatever it is, and knew him for a couple of months and then eloped with him. 
[03:06:00]  He was the manager of the place, the Palm Restaurant.  So the problem is, the story that's come out, and that's why I'm saying it to you guys now, because it's already way out there.  It's been in every newspaper and TV show.  It's on Good Morning America, too, by the way, last week or something.  But anyway, rumors came out.  She went to Spring Train to cover the Dodgers and interviewed Derek Lowe, and the rest was pretty much history.  Derek is still married.  She's still married, although she was going through a separation.  And she may be divorced now. 
[03:06:30]  I don't think she quite is.  But Derek is still married with three kids.  And the rumors were out there, and she actually denied it to me, talked to me about it a couple of times.  She knew the rumors were out there.  And it's none of my business, as long as she could do her job.  But it got pretty hot and heavy as far as rumors around Dodger Stadium.  And finally, Derek's wife found out.  And when she found out, she let everybody know, including Fox, including the Dodgers, including Tom Likas, including Good Morning America, including Andrew at the Carolyn's house. 
[03:07:00]  And there was a denial there.  And that's the last I know of it, because I haven't seen Carolyn since.  But that Tom Likas must have really ran with it, huh?  Oh, he had a blast with it.  Oh, that guy's terrific.  He had a blast with that?  Let me tell you something about Tom Likas and his little career.  A couple of my colleagues did.  They heard him talk about it.  When he first talked about it, he didn't mention names, but it was pretty obvious when you're mentioning a local reporter, blonde, that covers the Dodgers. 
[03:07:30]  We've got a great story on Tom Likas.  Yeah, you know, and then, of course, her now-going-to-be ex-husband went on his show, apparently, and talked about it.  And Derek's wife went on a couple of shows and talked about it.  So both of them really went and exposed the story also.  See, I live here, because a friend of mine lives out in L.A., and he was saying that when the whole thing happened, a lot of people at first were kind of tentative on it, 
[03:08:00]  but then it just seemed like as the story kind of picked up momentum, nobody was too sure exactly, you know what I mean, if it was just going to be like, you know.  Yeah, well, the problem was it was, you know, people do what they're going to do, but there was no discretion to it at all, and it was pretty uncomfortable at the ballpark.  And it was, for me, even to work with her, it was, I had noticed a personality change in the way she was emotional during her reporting. 
[03:08:30]  If certain players on the team had not done well or certain hitters didn't do well in support of other players, and I kind of told her that.  I said, you know, don't let it affect your job, and told her some other things.  I said, you know, whatever you're doing, just, you know, be careful.  All right.  Well, we got three really, really hot ladies from the Penthouse Club here in New York. 
[03:09:00]  Ladies, you want to get topless and ask Kevin Kennedy a baseball question one at a time?  What do you think?  That's the way to go with this, right?  Sure, why not?  Certainly.  Now, you're Farrah, right?  Yes.  Farrah is beautiful, blonde, blue eyes.  Yes.  How tall are you?  Five, seven and a half.  Very nice.  Beautiful.  Thank you.  Hi, Farrah.  She can't hear you.  Yeah, because why put headphones on the guests?  Well, considering they're going to be asking the questions of Kevin Kennedy, who's on the phone. 
[03:09:30]  Do we have more headphones, though?  Yeah, Gavin, if you could give up those headphones.  Thank you.  All right, so this is what's...  Well, first, you've got to take off your top.  Yeah, it's hard to get the top off over the...  You have to say please.  Please.  I'm sorry, Farrah.  Of course.  It looks good to me.  Whoa, hey.  There's something you don't see every day.  Are we getting...  You're natural, too.  Very nice.  Wow.  For real.  I was about to say something, but now I have to look at the other ladies before I say it.  We're not big fans of the implants.  I don't mind them.  Oh, the one girl went, uh-oh. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, okay, okay.  I don't have implants.  We're just not...  I mean, personally, I'm not a fan of the...  That's...  Yes.  Very nice.  Wow.  What size are those?  36C?  Yeah.  Full C, though, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Capital C.  Very good, Opie.  They're big.  You're lovely.  Big.  All right, Kevin, we have a beautiful blonde that's topless in the studio that's going  to ask a baseball question.  Her name's Farrah from the Penthouse Club.  Penthouse Banny.  Who does Roger Clemens play for now?  Oh, wait, no.  Who did he used to play for?  No, it's not...  It's not a quiz. 
[03:10:30]  This guy's brilliant.  I thought I was asking a question about baseball.  Technically, she's right.  All right.  Yeah, but I'm sorry.  I misinterpreted the question.  All right, wait.  Baseball question.  I like Farrah, but I got to explain to you.  Kevin Kennedy, he's a baseball expert.  Oh, you're going to give me a question.  He coached and everything, and he's got a book out called Twice Around the Bases, The  Thinking Fans Inside Look at Baseball.  So this guy knows things.  Like, it's about...  Here's the thing.  He's wrote some great...  Like, here's an example.  Like, Kevin, page 103, second paragraph.  It says here, the point was that they had to do the right thing in this situation. 
[03:11:00]  Explain.  Wait, let me get my book out.  No, no, take your book out.  What are you getting out?  So, Farrah, what we're looking for is maybe something you want to ask Kevin about, you  know, baseball in general.  A little...  Um...  Something maybe a little more thought-provoking.  Well, I'll answer that question.  Clemens used to play for the Yankees.  There you go.  Used to play for Toronto.  Used to play for the Boston Red Sox with me.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  He pitched for me back in Boston.  Are you a Red Sox fan?  Now he's with the Astros in Houston. 
[03:11:30]  Are you a Red Sox fan?  Yeah, I was when I managed.  I'm sorry.  Absolutely.  Are you?  Are you?  No.  Who do you like?  Anybody?  I like the Yankees.  I like the Yankees now, too, because I'm not managing the Red Sox anymore.  Her breasts are so nice.  It's distracting.  They're very sweaty.  Now, what?  Ah, that's fine.  It's not like lamb.  Oh, Kevin?  What's the place, you guys?  When I heard you guys first come on, what's the place?  The Penthouse...  What is it?  A restaurant?  A Penthouse Executive Club here in Manhattan.  Yeah.  It's a beautiful place.  Is it brand new? 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  Oh, pretty much.  We've been open for two years.  Where is it?  It's at 45th and 11th.  We have an awesome steakhouse, too.  We'll all be out there.  Yeah.  I'll cover it for Fox.  It's Robert's Steakhouse right in the club, as well.  Yeah, the food's amazing.  Nice.  With the beautiful women, of course.  Is the steakhouse actually...  Can you look at the girls naked while you're eating?  You can actually get a lap dance while you're having your ribeye, as well.  Wow.  Really?  So you get, like, a steak with a side of ass.  It's kind of nice.  How great is that?  Yeah.  A little log.  I'm on a little curb diet. 
[03:12:30]  And we also have private rooms that are very fun.  The champagne room?  No, no, no.  They're actual private rooms.  Like, you know, it's very nice.  Wow.  You should come check it out, for sure.  I like fire.  Sounds like a nice club.  How about a really good question for Kevin?  Are you wearing a thong underpants?  Oh, yeah.  You want to take...  She's wearing slacks.  Yeah, you better take your slacks off.  It's really hot in here.  No?  No?  That time of the month?  Wow, you're good.  Opie just calls him as he sees him. 
[03:13:00]  He's like a champ.  Are you Opie?  You can smell it.  Yeah.  How did you get that name, Opie?  Look at me.  Figure it out.  He was molested by a deputy in Mayberry.  Oh.  You really think I came up with this name a year ago?  I mean...  I mean, you never know.  I had it since I was 12.  11, I think.  All right.  How about another question for Kevin?  Something a little more thought-provoking.  Okay.  Who did Steve Avery pitch for?  The Atlanta Braves.  Oh.  Oh, good.  And then who did he relief pitch for after that when they... 
[03:13:30]  He was with a lot of...  He was with Boston for a while.  Did you sleep with Steve Avery?  No, but I was in love with him when I was like 12.  Yeah?  They were my first favorite team, the Braves.  Because I'm from Texas and my family lives in...  His loss.  Yeah, no, I was in love.  I even know his pet peeves.  What's Steve Avery's?  Toothpaste in the sink.  That was his pet peeve.  And I was so heartbroken when I found out who was there.  I was like, oh, no!  At 12, you were heartbroken?  12.  I promise.  If he saw you right now, he'd be heartbroken, too.  Yeah, I bet he would.  He'd have a new pet peeve, that's for sure. 
[03:14:00]  He'd find his wife dead in the walkway with some sunglasses next to her.  His pet peeve would be an old, nagging wife, right?  Exactly.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Farrah, any more questions?  Can you hear me?  Farrah, where are you from?  Really low, really low.  I lived in Houston for six years, but I originally grew up in Florida.  Yeah, Texas.  It was great.  Yeah.  Hey, Mars.  I live in Dallas.  Hold on a minute.  Are we testing microphones now?  Mars, I just hear him going, hello, hello, hello. 
[03:14:30]  What are you testing?  That was on the air.  Oh, we got another.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't know what was going on.  I'm sorry.  Mars was just doing his job.  On the air?  Was it on the air?  I don't know.  I heard it in my headphones.  All right.  I get scared.  Any of the ladies want to get topless and ask Kevin Kennedy a question?  Yeah.  Are you the shy one?  I'm not shy.  Oh, okay.  I was actually really high.  I couldn't wait.  Oh.  They're real.  Are they really?  Oh, come on.  Yeah, they're real.  Are they real?  Come on.  Those are perfect. 
[03:15:00]  No, they're, but it's a nice job.  They're real.  They're really real?  Yeah.  What do you think, Jimmy?  Would you feel them?  I would.  I'll test them.  Jimmy's the feeler.  If you won't hit me, yeah, it's okay.  Kevin, I'm sorry, but we've got to feel boobs.  We'll be right back with you.  I'm with you.  I'm banging right here.  All right.  Jimmy's now feeling up the girl.  I'm testing.  She's another beautiful girl from the penthouse executive club.  They're real.  Wow.  No.  They're real silicone?  Wait, listen.  Let me test you.  Oh, they're real silicone.  Yeah, they're real silicone. 
[03:15:30]  You know what, though?  That's a good job, because I think you went under the muscle, right?  She went under the muscle, Anthony.  Yeah, under the muscle.  See, that's the way to go, ladies.  If you're going to go the implant route, then you've got to do it under the muscle.  Tell me the truth.  Don't they look good?  They're very nice.  They look really good.  They felt perfect.  What's your name?  Christine.  Christine.  And how tall are you?  I'm 5'1".  That's okay.  She's lovely.  What's wrong with that?  What nationality are you?  I'm Colombian.  Colombian.  All right.  We're trying to paint pictures for the audience here, and you've got a very nice set.  She is a lovely gal.  Yes.  You got a question for Kevin Kennedy? 
[03:16:00]  I don't know anything about baseball.  It's okay.  That's the beauty of this bit.  Trust me.  Fine.  We're not trying to get anything done here.  I only like to say that I like the Red Sox.  Red Sox, right?  Oh, yeah.  Because, you know, I'm in New York, so nobody wants to hear about Red Sox here.  So you don't want to make a lot of tips when you dance, basically?  No.  No.  I just want to make fun.  You know, it's funny.  Yeah.  You know, it's just...  All right, Kevin, any comment on that?  She's from New York, but she likes the Red Sox because it, I guess it just annoys everyone 
[03:16:30]  here.  Exactly.  Oh, that's tough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's not good when you're living in New York.  No.  In New York.  Although everybody jumped on the bandwagon after last year, and now you see a bunch of  B-hats walking around New York.  Like, you want to smack them in the head?  Yeah, but the true Yankee fans don't do that.  They're not jumping.  It's just like either you're a Yankee fan or a Mets fan.  I mean, you can't be both if you're living in New York.  Same thing with the Red Sox. 
[03:17:00]  Right.  No, but a lot of people are in relationships with Mets fans.  Oh, that's right.  A lot of...  Because the Mets, for some reason, really seem to be a girls' team.  You know?  The girls like the Mets.  Right, Ope?  She has a question for you, by the way.  Another question, which might be a little bit different.  Oh, okay.  A little, like, more inside.  I hear some rumors.  I don't know if it's true or not that Ty Cobb is dating Dion?  Warwick.  Dion Warwick?  Is Ty Cobb dating Dion Warwick?  Is that your question for Kevin Kennedy? 
[03:17:30]  Probably something.  Probably.  No, tell me the truth.  Ty Cobb misunderstood Kevin?  I don't know.  I've never met him.  I saw the movie.  I've heard.  So, I have a question for you.  All right.  Do you want to come to the club and feel my boobs there?  No, I'm just kidding.  Dude, they're fantastic.  You can't tease like that. 
[03:18:00]  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  But I hope you come to the club.  It's a great club.  Penthouse accepted.  Of course.  Her nipples are fantastic.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're really concentrated on those.  How can you not?  I was testing for real.  That's what I do.  You're still testing.  I know.  Could you just cry a little and say enough, mister?  What does tweaking the nipples have to do with testing if they're real boobs or not?  Yeah, Jimmy.  Because as we know, the implant has nothing to do with the nipple.  Because what happens is this.  Do you have to ruin everything?  If you tweak a little bit, you can test the consistency of the breast because the skin, 
[03:18:30]  when you're tweaking, it gets taut.  Yeah, but the skin isn't...  No, but it is as the nipple hardens, the skin tightens just a little bit.  And that does what in your detection of...  It helps clear stuff leak out.  Really?  I see him checking and it's like, that move is not checking.  That is simply for his pleasure.  I was trying to help her out.  She's a very, very beautiful, nice girl.  By the way, Farrah is now sitting on the Liberator.  The Liberator?  What's that?  What's the Liberator all about? 
[03:19:00]  You really don't know what the Liberator is about?  Look at it and tell me what it's made for.  Why don't you show me?  Sex positions?  Very good.  Sex positions.  That's right.  One for Farrah.  Kevin?  I'm with you.  Do you have anything on sex positions?  I don't know what the Liberator is.  Huh?  What is a Liberator?  It's pretty much...  How do you describe the Liberator?  It's a small couch that is made just to get your lady into different positions.  Oh, okay. 
[03:19:30]  Like a pie wedge shaped.  Very inviting.  You know, you don't have to, you know, use the pillows anymore that you're going to sleep  on after the fact.  Yeah.  Do you guys have a website with all your guests that you have right now?  Oh, you want to see them, don't you, Kevin?  Sure.  Well, you're giving a good visual, though.  Yeah.  Steve, are we taking pictures?  Oh, no.  We can't take pictures in this situation, unfortunately.  I think we should talk more about the private rooms at Penthouse.  All right.  Why don't you, Farrah?  What goes on in the private rooms?  Well, you have to come and find out for yourself.  You have to say, though, you have to tell people because nobody will come just to find 
[03:20:00]  out.  I guarantee it's worth it.  When are they going to make knee jobs legal again?  Knee jobs?  Yeah.  The only women dance, you get the knee on the...  I'm sorry?  The little knee.  The knee on the crotch.  Oh, I don't know what that is.  No, I'm not saying it happens at your club.  Don't panic on us.  No, I like the couches in the private room.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  These are kind of like the couches in the private room.  Only ours are much bigger and...  Bigger, a lot more room to maybe, you know, relax on.  A little more private than, like...  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I guess it could have eight more.  I hear you. 
[03:20:30]  Hey, Kevin, you have an interesting chapter here called The Greatest Hitters I've Ever  Seen.  You got Tony Gwynn.  You got a bunch of people listed.  Where's Louie Soho on that list?  You better worry about coaching third base.  Okay.  I'm surprised David Kingman didn't make that list.  Anything?  No, I was going back to the...  No, no, no.  It was cool.  Nothing?  All right.  Hey, Kevin, what do you want to say about your book?  Just it's, you know, the book really is about 17 years of perseverance before you finally 
[03:21:00]  arrive in the big league and then how quickly it can be taken away.  And you better have a backup career.  That's basically what the title's about.  Bill Guttman, by the way, the writer, is from New York, and he is a Yankees and a Mets  fan both because he's a New York fan, so I have to take that back what I said earlier.  I think he's the only one I really know that likes both teams, but he really pulls for the  Yankees.  But anyway, he's a long-time sports writer and contacted me three years ago. 
[03:21:30]  It's not a reactionary book based on what Jose Canseco said in steroids in February or based  on what's going on right now.  But it's not really something I ever wanted to do.  It wasn't about, you know, making a lot of money or anything like that.  But I'm proud that Harper Collins published it.  It's a big-time publisher.  And there's a lot of insight into what it takes to get there, how many years you've got to  spend in winter ball and the experiences there.  There's a lot of insight.  Is he still a poker?  Yeah.  No, he is.  Kevin, go ahead. 
[03:22:00]  Are we going to have Kevin Kennedy on the show today?  Kevin, they're...  Kevin, what's the book about?  They're trying out...  Roger Clemens played for him.  They're trying out different positions on the Liberator, Kevin.  Well, you know, there's some stories about the guys in a clubhouse and the things that...  No, I'm kidding.  If you're a baseball fan, this is right up your alley.  They're wearing slacks.  Yeah, the girls are wearing slacks, which is a little strange.  I wish you were here because I was going to show you my red panties. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, you've got red panties, do you?  We'd love to see the red underpants.  He has to come and see it.  Hey, Kevin, I think you've got a fan.  We have to leave something to the imagination.  I like that.  I need a fan.  I hate imagination.  Imagination stinks.  Imagination is so overrated.  Oh, come on.  I'm using my imagination for 37 years.  That's the beauty of having hot girls here.  All right, Kevin, finally, steroids.  What's the take these days?  Well, I say they don't like them.  I think you're going to see the policy change next year.  The basic agreement with the players is up in 2006, 
[03:23:00]  and I think you're going to see the first-time offenders at least be up to 30 days,  maybe the 50 days that Buck Seawing's trying to do.  But you're going to see it a lot stronger.  I hope Congress doesn't have to completely overtake this, because if they do,  you're going to see them probably adopt the policy like we have worldwide with the Olympics,  and you're going to see a lot of players banned after the second time.  And, you know, it's wrong.  We all know that. 
[03:23:30]  People will try to get the edge any way they can.  What's going to happen with the records?  Nothing.  You don't think?  They're not going to – no, there's no way you can go back.  Even Rafael Palmeiro, whatever comes out of Palmeiro's thing,  as Congress has his results now from the test, it's going to come out next week.  I really don't know how far you can go.  You can't really go back to 1992, 1993, which he played for me, by the way,  in those years, in 1993.  And I never saw it.  We were never aware of it.  And it just wasn't something you did in the clubhouse.  You know, when guys are doing cocaine or marijuana or they're drunk and all that, 
[03:24:00]  you can see that.  The signs are there.  Steroids are not that way.  Unless you see a guy change from one winner to the next  and come back with 40 pounds of muscle mass,  then you have a pretty good idea of what he's been doing.  And a talent.  But all the guys that I've managed, Jose Canseco and Rafi and, you know,  Juan Gonzalez and all these guys,  they were already the size they were now as far as their body.  And it wasn't like you saw changes.  And, guys, you know, the roid race thing that people rumored about, 
[03:24:30]  what I understand now is that there's different types of steroids.  There's so many different types that they don't really necessarily make you do that,  have the inconsistencies in your personality.  So it's really hard to detect unless you do drug testing,  and that's what they've done.  So, you know, they found it.  They've got it.  They've got a few guys.  They've got eight major leaguers.  Rafael being a huge one,  because he's going to the Hall of Fame or should be.  But that may stop them.  Who knows?  The riders may say, you know, when he retires in a year or so,  they may be saying, hey, Rafi, you cheated all your career. 
[03:25:00]  But I don't think you can go back to the early 1990s  and detect what he did then versus now.  I don't think the records are going to change.  A few people were saying that with, you know, every X amount of years,  baseball seems to have one thing that will kind of, like, crop up.  And that if you, like you're saying with steroids,  will people, like, if they don't stop, you know, crack down on it,  do you think that there's, like, for long-term repercussions,  or is it just, you know, like something that's probably, you know, 
[03:25:30]  not going to go in that direction?  You mean as far as the dangers of it?  Yeah, well, no, like, with fans.  No, you know what?  Fans that call in to Rob Bibble on our show in the afternoon,  they're upset about it.  Most of the parents that call in or men that will call in  that have 12-year-old sons are concerned.  But they're educating their kids on it.  So the one good thing about all this negativity is we're all getting educated on it. 
[03:26:00]  People don't really know enough about it.  I mean, steroids were legal in the United States until 1991.  So even when Jose Canseco did it in the 80s, not only was it legal in baseball,  it was legal in the United States.  Well, you know, since that time, I mean, Arnold Schwarzenegger,  the governor out here in California, is an admitted steroid user.  And it was all legal when he was doing it.  So that doesn't make it right now.  We found out that Lyle Alzado, it enlarges your heart.  It can create heart attacks.  It makes you impotent. 
[03:26:30]  I mean, it does a lot of things that later on in your life that can shorten your life.  Do you think that explains why Palmaro is doing Viagra commercials?  I mean, he was doing steroids.  Well, you know, somebody called me said that one time.  I said, you know, we can't go there on our show.  I don't know if we want to go there.  It came out in the paper that Jose's wife said that Jose had, like, non-existent balls.  That's what Jose said.  Jose came on our show and said that.  Oh, he said the same thing?  Yes, he did.  He came on our show the day his book came out in February, the day we launched, actually. 
[03:27:00]  And he was in our studio out here in L.A. where I lived for an hour.  Jose lives right down the street from me, not too far away.  And we're good friends.  I've known him for years.  And I don't agree with a tell-all book, but he did.  But, you know, I'll tell you one thing about Jose.  I've never known him to be a liar.  He's never been a liar to me.  So he said that.  He said it didn't affect anything else at all.  He said, if anything, it made it better.  But it definitely shrunk other parts of his anatomy, for sure. 
[03:27:30]  Wow.  That's a fact.  So the long-term repercussions for fans, though, you know, you get through it.  It's like every era.  I mean, you had the gambling era, the 1920s, and the World Series was fixed, and fans got past that.  And, you know, laws were passed in baseball, no gambling.  And you go into every major league clubhouse, and myself having been there for a lot of years,  that's the first thing you see in every clubhouse is about the perils of gambling.  You're not allowed to do it, and you're not allowed to gamble on baseball and this and that.  Now you're going to see the same thing with steroids. 
[03:28:00]  I say steroids for everyone.  I love seeing someone hit 80 homers a year.  It makes it very exciting.  I think you probably appreciate it.  I can't speak for you, but I think baseball fans in general will appreciate the guys right now that are doing it  and doing it legitimately and appreciate that talent even more.  I mean, Adam Dunn with the Cincinnati Reds is a guy that's, you know, 6'7", and whatever, 260 pounds,  and he's going to hit 50 home runs every year.  And if he ever gets into the 60 mark or more, you know, I have a pretty good idea it's going to be legitimately. 
[03:28:30]  You know, that's the problem.  When you see those records that were broken in 1998 and just shattered,  going back to Roger Maris in 1961 with the Yankees,  it was not just one guy getting close.  I mean, there were several guys hitting, you know, 55 home runs, 58, 60, 65 home runs.  Then, you know, you had a pretty good idea if something else was going on for that to happen.  All right.  We've got a final question here from one of the lovely dancers. 
[03:29:00]  Kevin, it's actually a compliment.  I'm looking here at your book, you know.  Very nice.  Congratulations.  Thank you very much.  You're a sexy, hot man.  I'm going to spank you when you come to the club.  I'm coming.  That's why I asked where it was.  Oh, you've got to call.  Let me know for sure.  Yeah, it's the Penthouse Executive Club, 45th Street, corner of 11th Avenue.  Well, when I get to town, I mean, that's the thing I always love when the Yankees are in the playoffs  and in the World Series because I love New York, and I do have a lot of Yankee friends now.  A lot of the guys on the team are friends of mine because I've covered them so much. 
[03:29:30]  I manage against Derek Jeter, and I know Derek really, really well, and I'm sure he's...  Bring them to the club.  Yeah, bring them to the club.  What's better than steak and poo-ha?  Yeah, Kevin, come on.  Kevin tells me you won't be through New York this year.  You're looking forward to it.  But the Yankees have to get the World Series.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  But thank you for the compliment.  I appreciate that.  All right.  It's Kevin Kennedy, everyone.  He does a show with Rob Dibble on XM 175 Home Plate.  You're on later on today, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, at 12 o'clock our time out here in L.A. 
[03:30:00]  Absolutely.  All right.  All right, man.  Good talking to you guys.  Look forward to seeing you.  Thank you, Kevin.  We appreciate it.  And the ladies as well.  Thank you.  All right.  There he goes, Kevin Kennedy.  And we also want to thank the ladies for stopping by.  Oh, yeah.  Where are the ladies going?  Yeah, where are you guys going?  Nowhere.  Right here.  Okay, they'll be hanging.  So we'll take a break and we'll continue.  Right.  All right.  I can't find a bra that will holster my massive hooter.  I'm very proud of my big toe.  Thank God for Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  All right. 
[03:30:30]  That was a lot of fun. 
[03:31:00]  Chicks.  The girls were really hot, but the slacks thing was a little weird.  Oh, it's hot.  Is that the new dress code or something?  I don't know.  He's wearing slacks.  I've given up.  You've given up?  Why, Jimmy?  What's wrong?  I would have like puff pants.  Let's just bring trannies in one time.  Can we do that?  Can we bring a few trannies in?  At least they're not going to go-getters.  That's over the line.  It's not.  They're go-getters.  Jimmy, what's wrong?  Jimmy?  Nothing.  Jimmy's sad.  Jimmy's disappointed.  I'm not.  Yes, you are. 
[03:31:30]  They like seeing a little more.  Who doesn't?  I know I'm doing my monologue today in class.  That's going to be an abomination.  What are you doing?  In your acting class, Jimmy?  Yeah, I didn't want to go, man.  Is that your dialogue?  Yeah.  Let me see.  Do you want to try it on the show?  No.  It's actually not that badly written.  It's not funny, but it's not that bad.  Who are you?  Jennifer?  Jennifer?  No, I'm not.  You're Robbie?  No.  Who are you?  It's from a horrible show called It's Like You Know, which was canceled.  The monologue's good, though. 
[03:32:00]  It's about L.A. was trying to somehow justify its own awfulness in a sitcom, which didn't  work, of course.  Is that Robbie, the highlighted stuff?  Yes.  You got to do?  Yes.  Wow, that's a nice, long, little stretch of it.  Yeah.  Believe me, I'll fucking completely butcher it.  How do you do this?  Let me tell you something, Arthur.  Let me tell you something, Arthur.  You're not going to last two months.  You're going to last a long while.  Fucking stiff.  I'll move my hand awkwardly. 
[03:32:30]  Fucking go-bot.  How do you act?  Exactly.  That's going to be the hardest thing.  That's what everybody thinks when they see me.  Let me tell you something, Arthur.  You're not going to last two months.  Adam's a fine actor.  You know.  Yeah, Adam can act.  Sure.  So you're playing that kid toucher in that, what was that, Law & Order?  The little baby toucher, the Law & Order.  Yeah, the fucking pedophile.  You said documentary.  So you're playing that kid toucher in my apartment. 
[03:33:00]  The girls are saying goodbye to you guys.  Oh, right.  In their special way.  There they go.  Why did you do that when you were in here?  The one licks right by the nipple, but not actually the one.  Yeah.  It was still good, Jimmy.  It was all right.  You know, Jimmy's right.  It was like, don't, don't, don't even take me half the way there.  I can't.  They were hitting doubles for us.  That's okay.  Doubles.  You know, every once in a while we get girls come in here and they hit the home runs, but  they were hitting some nice doubles.  I just want you to do all topless and thongs.  I would have been cool with that.  Make an effort.  They made a fine effort. 
[03:33:30]  Meh.  After your big monologue there, the character Arthur spits out his sandwich and goes, oh,  there's mayonnaise on this pastrami.  Waka waka.  Yeah, that was L.A. trying to just, again, trying to justify L.A. and, like, make light  of L.A. and New Yorkers' perceptions of L.A., which are accurate.  And it just stunk and nobody wanted to watch it.  Yeah, they're not.  All right.  Hey, Arthur.  Good luck to you, Jimmy.  Hey, Arthur.  Hey, Arthur.  Shaw's stiffen up.  You notice the energy has, uh...  It was down when they came in. 
[03:34:00]  No, the energy is now down on the show because the film crew left.  Oh, yeah.  The girls with them.  Now we can be all like, yeah.  Good luck splicing something together out of that.  There was a film crew here all day.  Could they have given us a little bit of notice?  I thought it went fine.  It was fine.  I think we passed the audition for what they were looking for.  Really?  I think so, yeah.  Which is what, a bunch of men with, you know, a couple of chicks who wear slacks?  Slacks.  Fucking awful.  Where are the hot pants?  We're going to do a wax contest.  How about a chick who will blow somebody?  That would be lovely.  That's a good one.  You fucking pixelate my lap? 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  Or anybody else's lap.  Not that she has to blow me.  You did get to touch some booby, though.  And the one girl was on her thing there.  I did touch them.  You've got to wear slacks when you're on your thing, right?  No, you don't.  Or a skirt.  No panties.  Yeah, exactly.  No tampon.  A white skirt.  Then do a headstand and spin in a circle.  That's it.  And fucking spray the whole room.  Like that carnival paint thing.  Yeah, exactly.  Let someone squeeze your stomach and spin you around.  I want your feet to look like you were stomping grapes all day.  Whole room smells like pennies. 
[03:35:00]  Great.  There's a clot in my coffee.  I smell bit.  Yeah.  Period art.  Oh, that would be really, you know what I'm saying?  It's so gross, but it's really cool.  Get girls on their heavy flow days and just have them sit down on a white canvas.  It could be a little one, an eight by six, whatever.  They've got to spin it like you're at the carnival.  They've got to spin it like spin art.  You think that much is going to come out?  Spin art.  You need a girl on a real heavy day.  It doesn't drip like that, Ope. 
[03:35:30]  I just like the idea of just squatting on it and doing like a...  Rorschach.  There you go.  Rorschach test.  And you've got to push.  Yeah.  We've got to quickly squeeze some out.  OJ Simpson was on ESPN.  Hello.  Period art.  Actually, he wasn't even on ESPN.  This was just ESPN.com?  Does anyone know?  I was chipping golf balls.  All right.  OJ Simpson, the latest audio from him.  This is always fun.  What is he commenting on now?  Well, he talks about how he treats crazy people. 
[03:36:00]  Because there's crazy people out there.  I look in the mirror and brush his teeth.  Pulling his hair.  Let me tell you something, Ope.  Yeah.  Ah, that was from my monologue.  Good.  That was good.  That was good.  I think it was very believable, too.  Although, you looked really phony doing it.  I was.  You were smiling.  You put on that hate buster face.  Let me tell you something, C.  Why can't we pass out scripts and we'll practice with you?  We should practice.  There's no dialogue.  There's no one else can practice. 
[03:36:30]  With the pastrami sandwich line.  Yeah.  I don't need that.  And who's that dialogue before the highlight?  Yeah.  God, I can't last two months out here.  All right.  How would you do that, Adam?  I would call and say I'm too busy to take the audition.  Why?  It's not an audition.  It's for class.  Oh.  For class, yeah.  But you're a good actor.  Yeah.  I've seen you.  He was a kid toucher.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Act, Jimmy.  I want to see you act.  Do the lines.  You're like Bugs Bunny.  Come on.  Act.  Act.  Act.  Come on, Jimmy. 
[03:37:00]  Let me tell you something, Arthur.  I always put my hands at nipple level, like I'm Kimbo.  What's your character supposed to be?  I don't know.  It's just a scene.  It's just a scene.  Don't you need some kind of motivation?  Yeah.  How do you feel about Arthur?  On how to deliver that?  All right, Jimmy.  How do you feel about Arthur?  He's a cock.  Well, then you know what?  I want you to say, talk to me like I'm a cock and say those words.  I'm Arthur.  I'm Arthur.  I'm Arthur.  Set the scene.  We're under a porch.  That's right.  There's a dress over your head.  We're in a pickup under a bridge. 
[03:37:30]  I've just given you $20.  Let me tell you something, Arthur.  Arthur.  God, I won't last.  It's so hard.  I won't last two months out there.  Probably not.  And it ends with having to say Californian.  How hard is that a word?  How hard is it?  It is hard to end.  You're the brain-dead Southern Californian?  Californian.  Yeah.  I'm going to say Californian.  Yeah, but it makes it sound natural.  See, I would be Californian.  I can't act.  There's no way.  Welcome to the club.  It's a fine club you're in.  I should videotape it.  I want to see you. 
[03:38:00]  That would be great.  All right.  It's OJ on ESPN.com talking about how he treats crazy people, Anthony.  It's not plausible for many people in their mind to separate that from OJ Simpson, the murderer.  No, there's no OJ Simpson.  Right.  No, I'm saying in their mind.  That person doesn't exist.  Right.  No, I'm saying in their mind.  They're misguided.  And what do you do when you see a crazy person on the street?  You just walk right by and ignore them.  So that's how I treat people who feel that way. 
[03:38:30]  I just walk right on by and have a good day and I ignore them.  I love how he just lats his way through the tough question.  And here, no, that person doesn't exist.  No, no, no.  OJ the murderer.  No, no, there ain't no OJ the murderer.  I saw OJ Simpson New Year's Day the morning in Miami.  I was doing the improv in Miami for New Year's.  That morning I got a flight out early in the morning New Year's Day.  Me and my girlfriend are in the lobby.  It's like 6 o'clock in the morning.  There's a drunk white woman yelling at him.  A blonde, drunk white woman.  Wow.  And he's sitting there. 
[03:39:00]  And Maureen comes down and goes, what's all the yelling?  I said, no, just go walk past OJ, just get into the car and we'll go to the airport.  This woman is screaming.  I just wanted to tap her on the shoulder.  You know what he did to the last one, right?  Yeah.  What was she yelling?  She was just saying, you ruined the whole night.  You're drunk.  I'm not drunk.  Oh, one of those.  He was with her?  Yeah, he was sitting there.  Oh, I thought it was some other passenger just calling him a murderer.  No, while she was berating him in the lobby.  He was with her.  Wow.  Why didn't you get a picture with him?  I certainly would have.  In a second.  Murderer?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, you'd have to.  That would be a pretty good one.  Exactly.  Me and the marriage counselor.  Running out of show.  Thoughts on Scott Peterson.  OJ Simpson.  Well, I thought that Scott Peterson, you know, what I thought, if he did it or not, is immaterial.  I didn't think they had the facts for him to get the death penalty.  I thought he was such a disagreeable person.  And he talked so much that I felt that his death penalty came more out of his personality.  Than the actual facts that they had. 
[03:40:00]  There's so many people who have convicted of murder and have not gotten the death penalty.  And certainly I didn't think the facts were so overwhelming that he should have got the death penalty.  Do I think he was guilty?  Probably, yeah.  No, but I didn't think the evidence in the case warranted him getting the death penalty.  No.  He should have done some naked gun movies to make people like him.  If he could run the ball, he got off.  He is something else. 
[03:40:30]  He just doesn't even believe.  He did it.  Let's not be silly here, people.  Of course he did it.  There was no one else even close to have been able to do it.  And he just denies it.  He is one of the best.  He just denies it.  No, that O.J. doesn't exist.  There's no O.J. the murderer.  Yeah, there is.  He's sitting right here in front of me.  Dude, people hate him like he's Berlin in 1939.  Oh, oh, very good.  I recognize that line.  Hey, Jimmy! 
[03:41:00]  I recognize that line.  Very believable, too.  It's a gem.  That is a good line.  More audio from O.J.  This is what he wants to do now.  You're not going to believe this one.  How about ever working on trial coverage?  I would love to do that.  Now, that's something I really worked for.  I felt that I, from Robert Blake to Peterson to Michael,  I felt that I could have given an insight that I used to hear some of the experts say,  well, he's thinking this, they don't have a clue what this got, but they're so off-base, 
[03:41:30]  what's going on in these guys' minds, you know, doing in the middle of the trial and stuff.  And, you know, you can see the evidence, because I've had so many trials, it seems that I can  understand what the defense is trying to do, and then to hear an expert give a totally different  spin on it.  You know, and that's not the purpose of them bringing this evidence, you know.  So, and invariably, I'm always right, you know, when I see where it goes, you know.  So, yeah, that is something that I would like to do.  That is something that, like golf, I play golf because I love golf. 
[03:42:00]  That is something that I could have a real passion for.  That's great.  O.J., what's Robert Blake thinking?  He's sitting there thinking, holy shit, I killed my wife, and I'm probably going to get off.  This is amazing.  What should Michael Jackson do now?  Stretch your hand so the glove don't fit.  Yeah.  Dude, the problem with O.J. is the stupid trial was held in Los Angeles.  The people out there are so dumb, so shallow, so plastic. 
[03:42:30]  Are you going to do it with your eyes closed, like that?  That's the way you talk, you know.  That muscle looks like it's effortless.  Oh, it's the hardest thing.  That's awful.  I liked it.  Look me in the eyes.  We have one more clip.  We could sneak it in real fast.  He doesn't want to pay Goldman.  This is what he has to say about that.  Turn down the thing a little bit.  Are you content with your lifestyle, or do you have the desire to do more?  You always have the desire to do more.  I mean, I'm comfortable in what I'm doing.  Obviously, I want to do a little more because I'm accepting these invites for various, various  things.  You know? 
[03:43:00]  What things?  Kreskin?  Most of them are more social, but some of them are even business opportunities.  But when you have a $50 million judgment here, and a $25,000 judgment over here, you've got  to temper what you do in the business world.  Because, you know, I'm just a firm believer that I would rather have less in my life than  to pay somebody something that they don't deserve.  So, I'll pay less.  What a dick.  Oh.  Do you think he talked himself into it over the years, that he really didn't do it? 
[03:43:30]  Do you think he had a break?  He had.  It's the only way he can live with it.  How do you do that?  Where he actually believes, oh my God, I didn't kill these people.  Why do I have to pay them?  Why am I being shunned by society?  Why haven't Goldman killed him yet?  Yeah, that's the real justice.  Why hasn't he gone after him?  Let's go to the phones.  Prozac from whackbag.com.  Prozac.  I learned Opie Diggs, 21-year-old, that looks 16, and that guy from London loved to take  it up the ass.  Very good.  That was the highlight of the show. 
[03:44:00]  I want to thank Gavin for stopping on by.  And before you judge me, go see Broken Flowers with Bill Murray and check out that girl in  that scene.  God bless you, lovely Cox.  God bless you.  All right.  Tom in Boston.  Tom, what's up?  Hi.  Yeah.  Today I learned that Tranny's a real go-getters.  Very good.  And Ricky, what did you learn, buddy?  Program complete. </pre>
