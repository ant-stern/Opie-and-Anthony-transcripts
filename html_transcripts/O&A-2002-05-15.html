<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the fallout from a shocking phone call the previous day from a caller identifying himself as Eddie, a retired Queens truck driver.  Eddie confessed to a double murder of two Colombian drug dealers in 1977, detailing the gruesome disposal of their bodies. He initially made the confession while offering a room to Stalker Patty, a recurring homeless caller, leading to immediate disbelief and humorous reactions from Opie and Anthony.  The gravity of the situation quickly became apparent, however,  as the story exploded across various New York news outlets, including New York 1, Channel 2, Channel 9, Fox News, and the New York Post. The NYPD’s Cold Case Squad launched an investigation.  The show replayed clips from Eddie's initial call, interspersed with the hosts' commentary and reactions.  Eddie called back during the broadcast but, under police advisement, refused to discuss the murder confession, instead requesting a "Wow" t-shirt.  Stalker Patty was present in the studio, relieved she wouldn't be staying with Eddie.  Jim Norton was also a guest in the studio. The show's phone lines were overwhelmed. The news reporters' reactions to covering the story, particularly the involvement of "Stalker Patty" and "Eddie the Murderer," provided a recurring source of humor.

The segment with Eddie continued, with his story shifting throughout the call.  He initially maintained his confession before retracting it, claiming he lied and suggesting mental illness. He mentioned police visits and his fear of repercussions, repeatedly requesting a "Wow" t-shirt. The hosts and callers questioned his story, highlighting inconsistencies.  Humorous moments involved speculating about Eddie's mental state, referencing fictional characters, and banter between the hosts and callers.  Jason Newstead (formerly of Metallica) was mentioned as a scheduled guest, along with Ozzy Osbourne, who briefly called to discuss *The Osbournes*.  The consensus among the hosts and news crews leaned toward Eddie being mentally unstable rather than a murderer.  Patty, the frequent caller, was also mentioned as initially fearful of staying with Eddie after his confession but ultimately joined the broadcast.

The show then transitioned to a lengthy in-studio interview with Jason Newstead of Metallica, along with his Echo Brain bandmates, Dylan Duncan and Brian Sagrafinna. The interview began humorously with a discussion of the news crew's suspicions regarding the Eddie hoax.  The conversation focused on Newstead’s departure from Metallica, citing the need for time off for other musical projects and family. He clarified that there were no hard feelings, but his departure resulted from conflicting priorities and a lack of understanding from other band members about his outside musical commitments.  He also discussed Metallica's financial structure and stance on Napster.  Newstead further discussed Echo Brain, his new band, detailing its formation, musical style, positive reception, songwriting process, and touring experiences, contrasting the dynamic with Metallica.  The broadcast returned to the Eddie storyline; the police investigation revealed Eddie's confession to be a hoax, with him being determined to be mentally unstable. The hosts discussed the humorous aspects, including Eddie’s attire (a New York Giants jersey) when police arrived.  Callers contributed to the discussion, including topics like the Metallica Napster controversy and the band’s future. The segment concluded with promotion of Echo Brain's tour and a playful exchange between the hosts.

The final segment covered the aftermath of the Eddie hoax. The hosts reviewed photos and recounted interactions with Eddie, noting a large chest scar from heart surgery. They debated the confession's authenticity, with one host making a $100 bet on Eddie's guilt. The discussion touched on the ethics of continuing the story and the subsequent media fallout, including the removal of promotional materials.  A "What Do We Learn?" segment followed, featuring sarcastic and vulgar comments from callers and staff, referencing the hoax and other show events.  Jim Norton was mentioned repeatedly.  The segment included numerous crude jokes and sexual innuendo. The show concluded with repeated announcements of the station's call letters (94 WISP) and a planned "I Remember You" segment for "Eddie the Murderer" the following day.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oi! What's new?  Uh, nothing, man. We really don't have much to talk about today.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  That's the number you can use if you want to confess anything today.  Any confessions, we're taking your felonious confessions only.  Keep the misdemeanors to yourself.  Wow. And outside of New York, 866-277-4WOW. 
[00:00:30]  Hey, is this the part that they play on TV stations where they show the meters  and our voice coming out of a radio?  Or they show a car radio with the station frequency and our voice coming out?  Well, where do we begin?  I guess we could tell...  It's been a busy 24 hours.  I guess we could tell our faithful listeners that your old pals, Opie and Anthony,  are the top story in New York City.  Isn't it amazing how that happens? 
[00:01:00]  They're old pals.  New York One is already running the story every half hour.  And the, uh...  We just did an interview with Channel 2, Channel 9, and Fox is upstairs.  They're coming down here.  The post is outside the studio.  A little follow-up.  We were in the post today on page 8 for your reading pleasure.  Right.  I guess we've got to start from the beginning, Anthony.  Because there are people that don't listen to our show every day.  Well, you certainly missed one yesterday. 
[00:01:30]  That's why we always tell you guys, you've got to listen to the Opie and Anthony show  because you never know what you're going to hear.  Truly.  We never know on a day-to-day basis.  And, uh, well, if you were listening yesterday, you remember a call we got from Eddie.  Remember Eddie, Opie?  Do you remember?  Yeah, Eddie.  Yeah.  Eddie was going to be the new landlord for Stalker Patty.  Well, Stalker Patty...  Where is Stalker Patty today, by the way?  Yeah, where is she?  She's part of this story.  When I play something for our listeners, there are news readers right now that have to say, 
[00:02:00]  Stalker Patty.  It kills me.  And I wish this was TV because the video of this poor lady on New York 1 reading the phrase,  Stalker Patty.  She was so annoyed.  She's so pissed off that she's got to read this story every half hour.  You know, she's familiar with the program and she probably isn't a big fan.  And just the fact that she has to read off character names on our program, I love it.  Well, Stalker Patty, and we have to get her in here today, she's part of this big story. 
[00:02:30]  Stalker Patty, she has been without a place to live on and off for a long time.  Well, she got booted out of her last place of residence.  She stayed at a shelter for a little while, for one day.  And she couldn't take it any longer.  She was scared out of her mind at this shelter.  Yeah.  But then she was on our show yesterday and said, well, I got another place I could stay for a while.  Another arrangement.  This guy, Eddie, had offered her a room in his apartment. 
[00:03:00]  A little room in his apartment.  So we were talking about that and asking Patty what kind of a guy he is.  Listen, she had met him at a couple of functions that Ron and Fez have done.  And she seemed very happy with this guy, Eddie, and the fact that she would be sharing a room in his apartment.  Well, lo and behold, Eddie calls.  He must have been listening to the show.  And he called up to say that he'd be happy to have Patty there.  You know how crazy radio is? 
[00:03:30]  We were going to take a break and just blow off Eddie.  Right.  We weren't even going to take Eddie's call.  We were like, ah, what the hell?  Let's see what Eddie has to say.  Boy, he had a lot to say yesterday.  A lot to say, didn't he?  He was talking about how nice it would make him feel to have Patty stay there.  And that him doing something nice for somebody might get him that gold star to get into heaven  because of some things that he's done in the past, some bad things.  So, you know, you can't just leave that alone.  So we kind of asked him, hey, Eddie, what bad things did you do in the past that you're trying to make up for now? 
[00:04:00]  And instead of explaining it, Anthony, why don't we just play the tape from yesterday?  All right.  Here is that clip of Eddie enlightening us on some of the things he's done in the past.  Eddie confessing.  Yeah.  Here it is.  What's some of the crap you did in your life there, Eddie?  I don't even want to go through it.  Eddie, Eddie, this is like, you know what our show is like?  Eddie, where can we find the body?  Our show has given people salvation. 
[00:04:30]  It's a place to vent.  Eddie, give us one example of something that you would like this to maybe counteract in your life.  Give us one thing you did.  Murder.  Good night, everybody.  Are you there?  Are you there?  We weren't there because if you hear that audio closely, in the background you hear a chair.  I actually fell on the floor.  Yeah, Opie fell on the floor.  I just took my headphones off, threw them at my mic, and walked away. 
[00:05:00]  I couldn't believe the guy said murder.  And then we thanked the radio gods, and we continued with Eddie, who is now known as Eddie the Murderer.  Do they all have to have some Topey radio-type wacky character name?  Eddie the Murderer with you.  He's going to do our traffic.  Well, when Channel 2 was doing the interview with us, they're like, so there's Eddie the Murderer.  Eddie the Murderer.  He already has a moniker.  Yeah.  It's Eddie the Murderer.  Well, he did indeed say murder, and you can't just leave it at that. 
[00:05:30]  You know, we kept asking him questions.  So he told us how he did it.  Told us how he committed murder back in 1977, I believe he said.  Yes.  Eddie!  Yes.  So you're security for your buddy, right?  Yes.  Oh, you've got to explain.  Well, there was a drug deal.  That's what happened.  This was when he was just out of high school, he said, back in 1977.  He was involved with a friend that was into drugs in some capacity.  His friend wanted to go and meet a couple of drug dealers, these Colombian guys, to get some drugs. 
[00:06:00]  So his friend asked Eddie to go along with him as, like, backup.  Eddie brought a weapon with him, brought a rifle with him, and just kind of hung out in the back because the guy, his friend, was supposed to be alone.  Wasn't supposed to bring anybody with him.  That kind of made his friend nervous, I guess.  So Eddie showed up in the shadows and hung back.  And when Eddie thought there was a problem going on with the drug deal, he shot these two guys, these two drug dealers. 
[00:06:30]  And this is what he's explaining here.  Eddie!  Yes.  So you're security for your buddy, right?  Yes.  Now, at the time, are you a big guy, a big truck driver guy?  I'm 5'11", 240.  Well, were you armed in any way?  Yes.  With a firearm?  Yes.  And what happened?  The deal went bad.  And I just went blazing.  You went blazing.  And you shot the other drug dealer guy? 
[00:07:00]  Both of them.  Wait, did you shoot the guy you were with?  No.  Oh.  You shot two drug dealer guys?  I shot the other two animals.  And did you kill them both?  Yes.  So double murder.  And what happened now?  How did this play out in court?  It never played out in court.  Why?  It never arose. 
[00:07:30]  It never arose, he said.  You're thinking, why didn't it ever arose?  Yeah, that's what I thought.  I thought, okay, this guy, he's a young kid or something like that.  He's helping his buddy out with a drug deal.  Well, I mean, come on, who in this room hasn't?  Oh, come on, Norton.  I know you hang out with Voss.  Cover me, Norton.  Spank your mule and shoot it at him.  So he's helping his buddy out.  He kills two guys during a drug deal.  I'm thinking, all right, he may be a self-defense plea. 
[00:08:00]  He spent a little time in the can.  I don't know.  He got out, and that's where we are.  But no, Opie.  No.  No, no, no.  It never arose, as he said.  It never went that far.  And I believe he explains here.  Did they find these burnt-up, shot Colombians?  No, because we went back the next day.  We picked up all the pieces, and we scattered them all over New York.  But where was it that it was so out of the way that no one noticed for a day?  East New York.  Eddie, are you lying?  No, I would not lie about something like this, Anthony. 
[00:08:30]  I mean, I'm sweating like hell right now.  Is this the first time you've discussed this?  Besides the priest, you and my wife, that's about it.  Now, he explained before that why he didn't get caught.  Basically, he took the bodies, burned them somewhere else, chopped them up nice,  threw pieces out the car all over New York.  That story gets a little shaky, that part.  Like, I'm trying to get exactly what happened, and there were a couple of things. 
[00:09:00]  He said that he had left the bodies.  He never said where, but he said after they were burnt, he went back the next day  and gathered up the parts of the burnt body and scattered them around New York  and threw some of them in what he said was one of the garbage trucks that go around in the meat district  that pick up the grease and fat from the dumpsters down there  and just kind of threw in pieces of these drug dealers into those dumpsters, 
[00:09:30]  and they just kind of carted them away.  Right.  Here's more, Eddie.  Do you know that confessing to a murder can open you up right now to be arrested for it  and tried for it?  If they could find the body parts.  Well, you're pretty confident about that, aren't you, Eddie?  The guy was steady Eddie.  He was just very steady.  You know what I mean?  His voice didn't go, it just was smooth. 
[00:10:00]  Well, that was the creepiest part about this whole thing,  is it didn't, the guy does not sound like some guy calling to pull a gag  or, you know, do a wacky bit.  People in the past have tried to BS us about things,  and we, you know, like, all right, yeah, ha-ha, call someone else, click.  We're on record saying it's in the post today.  It's either this guy really did this, or he's very, very delusional.  Yeah, you either have his effing mind.  You're either crazy, and actually he believes that this did happen, and he did this, 
[00:10:30]  or he did this.  You know what I mean?  The guy comes across as sounding like somebody that did this.  You know, some of the details are a little off.  It's 1977 this happened, so, you know, maybe you don't have a complete recollection of it.  And how the hell do you prove something like that after this many years?  Right.  Well, here's Eddie talking some more on our show yesterday.  Eddie the murderer.  Eddie?  Yes?  Why are you so confident that they're not going to find any of the body parts?  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  Because I know what I did with them, and they'll never find them.  Like, what do you do?  I put them in, you ever see the meat trucks that come by once every two weeks to pick up the meat and the bones?  Oh, the big dumpster things that pick up the grease and the bones from the meatpacking district?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've seen those.  I just saw one the other day.  It was disgusting.  Big lump of fat hanging out the back.  Wait, this really goes on?  Oh, yeah.  The trucks down in the meatpacking district, they're going, they're special waste removal trucks 
[00:11:30]  that take the grease and fat from the meatpacking district.  And the bones.  And the bones.  And, Eddie?  Yes?  How did you utilize that?  I divided them up into six bags and dropped a bag here, dropped a bag there.  All over the tri-state area or just Manhattan?  Inside the trucks.  And they get boiled, and they make jello out of it. 
[00:12:00]  That's something you don't expect to get is some jello.  Here's where the fun starts.  Here's some Colombian-tasting jello.  Come here, try some, Rudy.  This just in jello stock has plummeted.  I don't know if they make jello out of it.  All right.  Jello.  So then he continues, Eddie the Murderer, with more details, Anthony.  Hey, Eddie.  Yeah.  This, no missing persons came from this? 
[00:12:30]  I don't care.  I don't know.  Maybe they came right from Colombia.  Who the hell knows?  And it was in 1977.  Mm-hmm.  The year after I graduated.  I graduated in 76.  And you know the guy that you did this with is still around?  What's his first name?  I read it not.  Oh, yeah.  Don't give too many details.  You're right.  You're right, Eddie.  Yeah.  He didn't want to give up his friend.  Isn't that nice? 
[00:13:00]  That's a nice guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Woo!  Man.  And then he starts admitting to other things.  Do you still keep a gun, Eddie?  I have six guns.  All legal.  All legal.  Any handguns?  Yes, I do.  Oh, you're able to get a handgun license?  I guess that was from your truck.  My wife has a handgun license, too.  And I think she should keep that updated.  Patty, right before I have orgasm, I'm going to stick my rifle in your balloon knot.  You ready?  Eddie, do you still have the murder weapon? 
[00:13:30]  Excuse me?  Do you still have the murder weapon?  No.  No.  You got rid of that?  Yeah, I cut that up in pieces.  Smart.  Where's that?  That's all over Brooklyn.  Got rid of the murder weapon, which would have been a very key piece of evidence in this.  Hmm.  You didn't answer for everything yesterday.  Yeah.  These are just the highlights.  I mean, we interrogated him.  Being detectives, Ant and I.  Yes, yes. 
[00:14:00]  For over an hour, and we couldn't, he didn't crack.  I think we should be known as the Starsky and Hutch of the new millennium.  We could get a wacky car and just drive around solving crime, Opie.  How fun would that be?  Put the siren out the window and stick it to the top of the roof.  Woo, woo.  We got crime to solve and radio to do.  And here's Eddie continuing.  I think he talks more about the cleanup.  So there's no evidence around at all, huh?  No.  No.  Cleanup?  We did a very thorough cleanup. 
[00:14:30]  Did they pull guns on you?  They pulled a gun on my friend, and that's when I took him out.  That was Brewer.  You know, we should say at this point, Brewer was in the studio yesterday helping us out  with the show.  He had us laughing our asses off.  He was doing an impression of Eddie.  And he was goofing pretty good with the guy.  And then you heard him there get all serious.  Like, wait a minute.  What the F am I listening to here?  Yeah, we were talking to Eddie, obviously, a little before he confessed.  And then Brewer was just making fun of him and imitating him.  The second he said he had committed double murder, Brewer just shut up. 
[00:15:00]  He stopped his little imitation.  Yeah, pretty much.  And then he talks about Son of Sam here, Ant.  Oh, he does.  I guess this happened in the same time period.  The Summer of Sam.  Hey, Eddie.  Yeah.  What month was that in, in 77?  It was the month of the Son of Sam.  What, like the summer that Son of Sam was?  Yep.  Remember a month?  He killed his first victim in Forest Park. 
[00:15:30]  And this went down the following week.  So the city was running around, you know, all screwed up.  Right.  Were you a copycat murderer?  No, no, no.  No, he had a reason for it.  Not like Son of Sam was a kook.  I just planned for it for the worst scenario.  Planned it for the worst scenario.  All right.  Our Eddie is a murdering Eddie.  It's Ted Baxter. 
[00:16:00]  Hear now the news.  Confess killer.  Okay, Eddie.  Rick's trying to get more clips.  We have one more.  Him talking about how they died, I think.  Did they die quick?  I don't know, but we packed them up in bags and we got them the hell out of there.  Where'd you burn them?  Where'd you find the bags?  So you packed them?  You're not going to believe it, but there's two bags here.  Perfect.  Two bags.  That's what you needed.  Where'd you burn them?  Well, I'd rather not say. 
[00:16:30]  Why not?  Because what if they might find an inkling of something or other?  Ah, the forensics.  They can't figure stuff out like that nowadays.  Not with plastic.  All right.  Cross Bay.  Cross Bay what?  In the marsh.  Cross Bay in the marsh is where they got burnt up.  We're getting more of the clips together for the show today.  So that's pretty much an overview of what happened yesterday. 
[00:17:00]  And we wake up today and we're in the New York Post.  And then the phone has been ringing ever since.  We've done an article or an interview with the Boston Herald already.  We're going live on a Chicago radio station in a few minutes here.  Yes, yes.  We got the New York Post.  They already did a follow-up.  They want to take some pictures.  We did an interview with Channel 2.  We talked to detectives.  Yeah.  We got Channel 9 and Fox News on their way.  Fox!  Well, they're here.  I don't know.  I don't know where they're at right now. 
[00:17:30]  But they really jumped on this one.  Yeah.  That's for sure.  Seems like this story has some legs.  Is there any way we can speak with Eddie today?  We've been talking to him off and on all day.  Yeah.  All day.  The last time we talked to him, he was kind of just laying in his bed.  Laying in his bed.  I'll tell you this much.  He said he had a wow shirt all neatly pressed next to him on the bed.  That's the last thing we've heard.  Look, all I want you to tell Eddie, I'm not one to say I'm not a whore when it comes to 
[00:18:00]  this.  You must have Eddie put that wow shirt on.  Oh, he has it on.  Oh, he has it on now?  Oh, no.  Because I called him back to make sure he had put it on.  I said, he just made me promise we'd get him a new one.  Oh, sure.  Sure.  Because the first W is a little worn out.  Those are good.  They use them like cigarettes.  All right.  Anthony, so I want to read the Post article.  All right.  Because we're on in a lot of cities right now. 
[00:18:30]  New York Post.  New York Post ran with the story today on page eight, Anthony.  Headline, hoax, leery, cops, probe, radio call, and slay, confess.  What?  The outrageous Opie and Anthony radio show turned into a deadly serious version of America's  Most Wanted yesterday when a live caller told stunned listeners he'd once killed two  men in a drug deal gone bad.  Some of the biggest fans of the popular WNEW show include cops who later flooded the station  with incredulous calls.  They were incredulous.  The NYPD's Cold Case Squad has taken the call seriously enough that its investigators are 
[00:19:00]  heading to the station's midtown offices today to listen to a transcript of the show.  And they did do that today.  He's either very delusional or he's telling the truth and he didn't sound like the kind  of guy to make this up.  Co-host Anthony Cumia said.  Ah, nice to have my name in the post and not have that picture of me and the ex walking  down the courtroom steps.  I think this is your first quote that has nothing to do with the Olsen twins.  Congratulations.  Did the writer say I was a gentleman? 
[00:19:30]  We're not making this up and it's not a bit.  When he said murder, my head spun around.  I know because people expect us to do this type of thing.  Yeah.  But I don't know how to convince you guys.  We have nothing to do with this.  Well, when we spoke with Dean Johnson from Boston, the Boston Herald, Boston Herald, he  was like, guys, really?  Numerous times he was like, guys, is this a gag?  Because he lived through the whole mayor prank.  Yeah.  He reported on it many, many, many, many stories there.  But no, we know how serious a crime it is to do something like this as a gag. 
[00:20:00]  All right.  The article continues, the man who identified himself on air as 44-year-old retired trucker  named Eddie from Ridgewood, Queens, said he was calling to offer one of the show's characters,  a homeless woman known as Stalker Patty, a place to stay.  Stalker Patty turning into a star in this whole thing.  Wait till we play the news clip that they're running every half hour on New York One.  When Opie and Anthony asked why, the man said it was to make up for a past mistake. 
[00:20:30]  Pressed on what he'd done, the man said he had killed two drug thugs in 1977.  After going with a pal to a warehouse on Pennsylvania Avenue in East New York,  Brooklyn, as backup on a deal.  The man described how he blew the pair away with a long-range rifle when one of them pulled a gun.  He said he and his friend took the bodies to a marsh, poured gasoline on them, and burned them.  They tossed some of the remains into garbage trucks in the meatpacking district, he said.  With all the crap in my life, this is a quote from Eddie. 
[00:21:00]  Eddie.  With all the crap in my life, maybe this, meaning offering, you know, Patty's shelter.  Yeah, that'll do it.  Will give me a gold star to get me to heaven.  Well, Eddie, let me look at your folder here.  Here, I see you killed two people, but you gave Patty a place to live.  Come on in, Eddie.  Enjoy heaven.  It looks like a wash to me.  Right.  The man said he confessed his crime to a shrink who urged him to talk about it.  I'm not worried about confessing because they'll never find the body parts, he said. 
[00:21:30]  But when a cop called and asked to meet with him, he hurriedly said he had to get off the line.  I'm sweating like hell right now, he mumbled before hastily hanging up.  Yeah, but then he continued calling back.  He called Ron and Fez after us here in New York.  He called the morning guy, Scott Farrell.  He called Farrell.  Farrell just lambasted him.  Eddie, what are you, an idiot?  Why don't you just put it on a billboard in Queens?  You're an idiot.  And then Scott was trying to interview him some more, and he admitted pretty much most of the same stuff that we just played you. 
[00:22:00]  And then goes, yeah, but I don't want to talk about that.  I want to talk about the Yankees.  I was called about the Yankees.  I called.  I wanted to comment on the Yankees.  What are you, stupid?  You're going to kill Yogi Berra.  Yeah.  Well, he kept saying, he goes, you're lying, aren't you, Eddie?  You're lying about this whole thing.  And Eddie just would not say he was lying.  He said, no, this really happened.  And then he said he just wanted to talk about the Yankees.  He goes, he wants to talk about Yogi Berra or something.  Farrell.  Farrell.  Kind of drawing conclusions that perhaps Eddie wanted to kill Yogi Berra. 
[00:22:30]  Mike's got a great idea on line four.  On line four.  Maybe we could tie this into some wacky part of our show.  Mike.  Hey, what's up?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, wait.  I got it.  What was it, OPA?  Our program wasn't there on the New York Times.  Are you there?  Yes, Mike.  Hey, listen.  I want to know if we could hold a contest, some kind of scavenger hunt for Eddie's body  parts.  For the Colombians' body parts all over New York.  What kind of prize can we offer?  A big wow sticker? 
[00:23:00]  You know, maybe have Eddie on the wow sticker?  This one's getting a little serious, my friend.  A little serious.  A lot of people are saying the guy's lying.  So, basically, it's in bad taste to have some sort of scavenger hunt?  I would love for someone to bring a piece back to the station, but I don't know.  Yeah, that would be very hard to...  Can we bag the pieces?  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mike.  I don't think that would be possible.  We love doing bits, but there's so much to the story that we've still got to get to. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  So, now, New York One is the first news organization running with the story, Anthony.  They're doing this story every half hour on the hour.  They're one of the local news stations here on television that repeat their top stories  every half hour.  It's just all news, all day, all night.  Listen to this poor lady.  You can tell she's not a fan of ours.  She pretty much hates us and can't believe she has to read the name Stalker Patty during  a newscast.  Perhaps Steve C. could put the clip on Foundry Music so you can look at her face. 
[00:24:00]  At the end of this, her eyes just roll and go to the side.  She makes the face like, oh, did I have to read that?  Yeah, we'll put the clip on FoundryMusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y Music.com.  Okay?  But this is how they're reporting it on New York One.  A murder confession on the Opie and Anthony radio show.  A man who identified himself as Eddie from Ridgewood, Queens called in yesterday to offer  one of the show's characters, a homeless woman known as Stalker Patty, a place to stay. 
[00:24:30]  The station says the man told them he was trying to make up for something he had done in his  past and was hoping his offer would give him a gold star to get into heaven.  When pressed on what he had done, the talk show says the man admitted to killing two  men in a drug deal gone bad in Brooklyn in 1977.  He reportedly went on to describe in detail how he blew them away and disposed of the body  parts.  Police listening into the show are said to have flooded the station with phone calls.  When one cop finally got through and asked to meet Eddie, Eddie quickly got off the line. 
[00:25:00]  The NYPD is now taking the matter seriously and plans on investigating the call further.  Oh, and they are investigating.  Ah, well, you know.  Big time.  Well, you know, they ask a couple of things.  Couple of things.  The detectives loved our office.  They're like, hey, we can't hang any of this crap in our place of work.  Hey, you see what one of them says, though?  What's with the Olsen twins poster?  Because I see a bunch of, you know, grown-up ladies on the walls here. 
[00:25:30]  What's with the Olsen twins?  I didn't fess up to it there.  I think I did say Ashley's the goer, though.  All right.  Pointed that out.  And if the phones have exploded, let's take a break.  Rick is trying to get Eddie on the phone.  I don't know.  He was there, what, at 2.30?  Yeah, last time I talked to him, he was there.  He was hanging out, laying in bed.  What happens when you call?  He just picks up the phone.  No, now.  Did you try calling him again?  I got a busy signal. 
[00:26:00]  Uh-oh.  Do you want me to try one more time before we go off?  Uh, we'll take a break.  We'll take a break, come back, and try.  Like, this is not a stupid radio tease.  We really don't know if we're going to get him on the air.  Yeah.  I'm not going to, like, you know, play that game today.  But we'll try.  All right?  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  What a day, what a day, what a day. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, yeah.  The phone numbers, once again, in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else outside of New York, 866-277-4.  Wow.  Right.  Right.  It's crazy around here today.  We just did a photo shoot for the New York Post.  Of course.  That's how it works.  It was awful watching you two try to be natural.  Isn't that horrid?  Yeah.  Yeah, like you're so good at it.  I'm terrible, too. 
[00:27:00]  Stop.  We hate it.  Because the way we're set up in the studio, it's not conducive to the one photo thing.  If they took a picture of Opie, where he is, and took a picture of me, where I am, and  then used two pictures, that's one thing, because we face each other.  So it's hard to get one shot.  So I have to go all the way around to the board, so we're standing next to each other,  like, this is how we are normally.  This is how we do the radio show.  Oh-ho.  Anthony, an inch to my left.  Yeah. 
[00:27:30]  Sure.  The headphones on, like you're doing...  Put the headphones on now to touch something, like you're working.  What?  Touch my junk.  So where are we at, man, with this Eddie thing?  Well, we played the New York One clip.  I do believe that other news organizations are making their way down here.  Is that what I hear?  Fox?  Channel 9?  Winds Upstairs is doing a story on this.  10-10 Winds.  The all-new station in New York. 
[00:28:00]  And we'll see how it plays out.  You want to hear the New York One story again?  Yeah, that's hysterical because she has to say Stalker Patty.  A murder confession on the Opie and Anthony radio show.  A man who identified himself as Eddie from Ridgewood, Queens,  called in yesterday to offer one of the show's characters,  a homeless woman known as Stalker Patty, a place to stay.  The station says the man told them he was trying to make up for something he had done in his past  and was hoping his offer would give him a gold star to get into heaven.  When pressed on what he had done, the talk show says the man admitted to killing two men 
[00:28:30]  in a drug deal gone bad in Brooklyn in 1977.  He reportedly went on to describe in detail how he blew them away and disposed of the body parts.  Police listening into the show are said to have flooded the station with phone calls  when one cop finally got through and asked to meet Eddie.  Eddie quickly got off the line.  The NYPD is now taking the matter seriously and plans on investigating the call further.  And all we know right now is they're investigating, Anthony.  Right. 
[00:29:00]  I mean, we have said many, many times, we don't know if this guy's legit.  We don't know if he's out of his effing mind.  He sounded crazy, but, you know, crazy people do crazy things.  Does he really believe this?  Right.  Is he just a mental case?  A metal case.  You are a metal case.  Well, it sure makes for a good story.  Yeah.  So that's what we're going with.  Why not?  Let's go to the phones.  They have exploded.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  The phones don't feel like working today. 
[00:29:30]  Uh-oh.  Ah, we don't really need the phones for a talk show on a day like today.  We'll get Pete because we need to talk to our listeners.  Pete.  We can't get, we can't take any phone calls.  I'm confessing to killing two vaudevillians.  I didn't like their show.  Pete Johnson, any confessions?  Here comes Pete.  Pete Johnson.  To fix the phones.  Confessions of a radio engineer.  Come on in, Pete.  Watch, when I do this, nothing happens.  See? 
[00:30:00]  See, he's down.  Hello, hello?  I once hit someone over the head with a CX-2200 digital delay.  It laid them out.  Are so many people calling that they've effed up our phone system there?  Pete, what's your diagnoses?  He's just staring at it.  He's just looking.  Usually he touches things.  What, Pete?  I don't know.  First time I saw this.  This is new to me.  Pick another number.  Why don't we have problems with the phone once a week?  Opie, hit another number. 
[00:30:30]  What?  What do you mean every other week?  There's always a problem with the phones.  Do a little soft shoe.  Like in Volvedil Beal.  All right, well, Pete tries to figure it out.  Look, he's not doing anything, though.  Because he's really confused.  He's not looking at things.  He doesn't know what to do.  Jim Norton in the studio today, Anthony.  Yeah.  And I just want to say to Jim, I hope you had a hell of a pee, Jim.  Please, sir. 
[00:31:00]  You missed a fun day yesterday.  Brewer was in.  Had a blast.  Yeah.  Getting all these messages.  Eddie called.  Murder was confessed.  I'm like, what?  And you weren't there.  No, of course.  I was curtain shopping.  Were you?  Yeah.  I really was.  Where did you go?  That's a good reason I missed the show.  Bed, Bath & Beyond.  No, that would be gay.  I went to another place.  On the Amsterdam.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  A little curtain store did you go to?  A little curtain shop.  And how did you pick them out?  I have to have them certainly designed a certain way because my wall is oddly shaped. 
[00:31:30]  See, much like your head.  See, but you say that.  I don't.  I think you have a very attractive head, Jimmy.  Now, why didn't you just get off the rack kind of...  You are a guy.  I can tell exactly what he's all about.  He got a place and everything's got to be, like, perfect.  You're right.  You went from a hovel, and now everything's got to be just so.  You're shopping for curtains.  Well, I... 
[00:32:00]  Oh, I hear somebody.  That is sad.  I kind of hear someone.  I'm only in three days a week.  I'm on it every day, so I wasn't in yesterday, so I had to go curtain shopping.  All murders being confessed, and the biggest news story of the year on the show, I'm curtain  shopping with Fat Bob Kelly.  Hey, we talked to a psychopath yesterday.  Pete, do you ever kill anyone, Pete?  Oh, my God.  Pete, what if this Eddie guy wants to call us, and we can't go to the phones?  Yeah.  That's why you're getting the big bucks, so you could stretch.  Pete, are you resetting the system? 
[00:32:30]  Are you going to reset the system?  I'm going to reset it.  All right, so we will lose all of our calls.  I hope not.  But you have no idea, right?  I just want to check the screener program.  Maybe there's something wrong on it.  Oh, perhaps it's the screener program.  He's got an answer, though.  Anthony, Dan from Hoboken, am I the only one that thinks this would make a great Law & Order  episode based on actual events?  Mm-hmm.  It's going to be interesting to see how this plays out.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, we'll stick with it and let you know how this turns out.  We got people.  We got people and places.  Let's just say that.  Updated info.  Have we been able to get a hold of Eddie there, Rick?  Now I'm just getting a machine with a female voice on it saying, leave a message.  Really?  It's not Patty's voice, is it?  No.  Patty's outside the studio, by the way.  Is she?  She.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe we can't go to the phones on a day like today. 
[00:33:30]  We need phones.  Is our guest coming in today?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, we got Jason Newstead coming in with his new band.  That's cool.  Echo Brain at 5 o'clock.  Is he pretty up front with talking about the Metallica guys?  He better be.  Does he have any dirt or is it just...  It's not like we want to find out about the new band.  Well, sure we do.  I'm just kidding.  You are so nasty. 
[00:34:00]  I want to find out what the guy's doing.  Looks like Ben just had a heart attack.  Don't worry, Ben.  They know we joke on this show.  Yeah.  Now we'll check it out.  Let's see how we felt about Lars with that whole Napster thing.  Why don't we get Patty in here while Pete works on the phones?  I can't believe we can't go to the phones.  Good.  Oh, oh.  Hello?  No.  All right, Patty.  Tell Pete...  He just douched the system. 
[00:34:30]  We have a big no signal up on the computer.  Let's go to Adam.  Adam, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Ah, we have national phones.  Hey, this is the reason why I think this guy is a little poor crap or whatever.  All right.  Um, he was talking yesterday about, uh, his bulletproof vest that he got from his, uh,  Cousins the Cops.  Right.  Earlier in the show, he said, uh, oh, he only told you guys, his wife, and one other  clips or whatever.  Uh-huh.  What's the deal there?  Then, then you guys asked him, hey, did you tell your cops, you know, your Cousins the Cops? 
[00:35:00]  He's like, yeah, I told him, I told him.  Oh, I know.  Every, every, every so often, he had, like, some conflicting stuff.  You could either...  Yeah, that's why I thought this guy was a poor crap.  That's it.  All right.  Well taken, well taken.  Yeah, later, boys.  All right.  Take it easy, man.  Thank you.  Yeah, like we said, we don't know.  We don't know what the guy's up to.  This guy.  Uh, Mark, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, guys.  What's up, Mark?  Yeah, I was just wondering, uh, you guys prepare to go to jail when this belated, uh, 
[00:35:30]  April Fool's prank goes bad?  This is not an April Fool's prank.  Come on, Fags.  It's obvious.  We will not be fingered for this one, my friend.  Dude, do you honestly think we set this up?  I think if you did, you're radio geniuses.  And if you didn't, you're morons for not doing it sooner.  We are not geniuses.  This one we did not set up, my friend.  No.  All right, guys.  Later.  If they just set this up, I would have known about it, and I would have been  to make sure I was here.  All the press that this guy, the loser I am. 
[00:36:00]  We learned our lesson with faking people's deaths.  It doesn't pan out too well.  It's in the paper today.  We've said it a million times today.  Uh, the guy's either really legit or completely off his rocker.  Yeah, it's not like we're saying he definitely killed two people.  We have no idea.  We're saying we didn't, uh, throw this together.  The guy could be a kook who just thinks, uh, it's funny to, to blurt that out.  The screen is now purple.  I know.  I don't know what's going on.  Thank you.  This is the luck we have, though, with this radio station. 
[00:36:30]  The one day we definitely need our phones to work, it doesn't work.  The New York lines.  Uh, Patty, what's up today?  Oh, nothing much.  I had a restful night on the couch at Billy's house.  Oh, you stayed with, uh, Billy Staples from Ron and Fezz's show, huh?  Yeah.  How did that work out for you?  Very well.  It was the first night I really slept.  Yeah?  And I was very comfortable.  He made me turkey, bacon, and eggs for breakfast.  Cooked your breakfast? 
[00:37:00]  How healthy.  Yeah.  Turkey, bacon, and eggs goes nicely with a rum.  Well, we had coffee.  So you slept over there.  Yes.  And you felt safe.  Yes, and I have another place for a few days with a girl named Kelly from Brooklyn.  Any, uh, murders in her background?  Uh, no.  So, uh, you're happy you didn't go over to Eddie's?  Very.  Yeah.  Really?  I was never so scared in my life.  Yeah, I know.  Uh, there was one point in the show yesterday you said you were going to pass out. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  I was.  And someone had to hold you up.  Talks about killing people.  It's weird.  Patty was standing there.  Jim, you missed it.  She's standing, first of all, she walks in the studio, she's crying her eyes out, and  we ask her, why is she crying?  She's like, I'm sick, I'm scared.  I'm terrified.  Why?  I'm scared, Tina.  I'm scared.  How great would that be if you tried to get Patty into the money snatch thing and she 
[00:38:00]  doesn't do it and she gets booted out and murdered by somebody?  I like you, Patty, you know that, but that would be really fun if you were murdered.  It would be great.  And Patty, you're a media star today.  Right.  I wasn't even aware that I was even in the paper.  Well.  I only read the daily news.  You should have heard New York 1.  You're known as the homeless woman.  Stalker Patty.  Oh, God.  Let's play the homeless.  Well, hopefully soon I won't be homeless.  I got a call from somebody.  All right, we don't really care.  It's not about you.  We really go off on an awful, uninteresting day. 
[00:38:30]  I know.  It's really not about you today, Stalker Patty.  Yeah, that's you.  Listen, you want to play the clip for Patty, though?  Yeah, listen to this, Patty.  It's all about you.  A murder confession on the Opie and Anthony radio show.  A man who identified himself as Eddie from Ridgewood, Queens, called in yesterday to offer  one of the show's characters, a homeless woman known as Stalker Patty, a place to stay.  The station says the man told them he was trying to make up for something he had done in his  past and was hoping his offer would give him a gold star to get into heaven.  And when pressed on what he had done, the talk show says the man admitted to killing two 
[00:39:00]  men in a drug deal gone bad in Brooklyn in 1977.  He reportedly went on to describe in detail how he blew them away and disposed of the body  parts.  Police listening into the show are said to have flooded the station with phone calls.  When one cop finally got through and asked to meet Eddie, Eddie quickly got off the line.  The NYPD is now taking the matter seriously and plans on investigating the call further.  There you go.  A homeless woman known as Stalker Patty. 
[00:39:30]  How about that, huh?  You're a homeless stalker.  Wonderful.  Hopefully I won't be homeless for long.  No, I met a girl named Amy Fisher.  She's taking me in.  I met a nice guy named Joe Rifkin in his pickup truck.  It smelled a little bit, but he had a nice...  Yeah.  You're a mess, Patty.  We have the Zodiac Killer on the line that wants to offer Patty a place.  The Zodiac Killer. 
[00:40:00]  Let's go to Eve.  Hey, Eve.  What's up?  Eve.  Eve.  What's your name, bro?  Eve.  Steve, well, Steve?  Yeah.  It says Eve on the screen.  It says Eve.  Who's the moron out there writing Eve?  All right, what's up, Steve?  In Grand Theft Auto, I was playing yesterday.  In the middle of, crap, on the third island, you can actually go on top of a roof, shoot  two of the Colombian cartel members with a sniper rifle and pretend you're Eddie.  Awesome.  So you reenacted...  Did you then burn the car?  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  You reenacted Eddie's...  I actually burned, and I burned the two bodies with the flamethrower.  You reenacted Eddie's so-called crime on GTA 3 last night.  Yeah, it was crazy.  I love video games, man.  What if this turns out to be Eddie, a guy that just plays GTA 3 too much, and he's convinced  now that he's part of the game?  Yeah.  Guys, I got another confession to make.  I picked up a hooker, and I had sex with her, and it re-energized me, and then I beat her 
[00:41:00]  with a lead pipe and took her money.  Eddie, that sounds a bit like Grand Theft Auto.  And then I jumped my car over some tractor trailers and got a stunt bonus.  And I'm waiting for the bridge to be repaired.  I'm playing a new game.  I cast a spell on some gnolls and got kicked out of the Cats and Hats Guild.  Wonderful.  Well, Patty, it's great. 
[00:41:30]  It sounds like your life is on an upswing now.  Yes.  Have you reached rock bottom, and you feel now you're bouncing back up after your stay  at the woman's shelter?  Yep, I'm rising back up.  Can I ask you a question, Patty?  You talked yesterday about how you were at a woman's shelter.  Yeah.  And why did you choose East New York, Brooklyn, to go to a woman's shelter knowing that that  is probably the worst area on the face of the globe, and you decided that that was where 
[00:42:00]  you were going to go to a shelter?  Why not go maybe to some nice place out on Staten Island, perhaps, or you could find somewhere  just outside the city, northward, or maybe in Long Island somewhere?  Why did you choose the worst hellhole in the world?  I was referred to Project Hospitality, and since I don't know the names and addresses of  any of these types of places, they told me to go there, and I just listened to them.  Why would you, do you know about East New York?  No.  And then once you got in the area, didn't you go, hmm, perhaps I shouldn't stay here? 
[00:42:30]  Well, when I, the train I got off at the stop, the houses, and the people looked normal,  you know, just like regular people.  I didn't think anything of it until I got to the station.  Regular people, they just looked a little dark, a little off.  You probably stayed with murderers that night.  Well, you could say they don't respect the people that stay there, no.  We don't either.  No.  No.  They don't respect the people. 
[00:43:00]  We got the New York lines out working finally.  David Berkowitz, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, David.  Okay, I want you to know that Patty can sublease my apartment until I get out on parole.  And that seems to be a long time.  The guy's damn called up and said I can't stay with him, but I can stay with his son.  And just don't forget to walk the dog.  All right.  All right, David.  Thank you.  Tell me what he says to you.  Let's go to Tom.  Hey, Tom.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  A couple of congratulations, and then one last thing. 
[00:43:30]  And it's not a hang-up, so I don't think I'm at all.  All right.  First, Anthony, congratulations.  You finally got more quotes than Opie and had nothing to do with pedophilia.  Opie, congratulations on your Opie vodka line.  Oh, thank you.  And this is one last thing.  Oh, vacuum.  Nice.  Opie hates vacuum cleaners.  Hates them.  Do I?  A lot of people calling in saying, why haven't they arrested this guy yet? 
[00:44:00]  Because they don't know if this is legit.  They're just maybe asking a few things.  If this guy is out of his mind.  Yeah.  So, you know, they're doing what they do best.  They're trying to figure this out.  Figure it out and see what happens.  And maybe it's, maybe the guy's just a kook.  I don't know.  Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  Did you happen to notice when a woman is doing a read from New York 1, when she gets to Patty's  name, she sort of goes like, Stalker Patty, like Thurston Howell from Gilligan's Island. 
[00:44:30]  Thurston Howell, the Stalker Patty, the third.  Because she's so pissed off that she has to say Stalker Patty.  So annoyed.  During her newscast.  So where are you staying tonight?  Well, I'm going to go to a girl's house who lives in Brooklyn.  Now, where'd you meet her?  Well, I met her over the phone when she called in Toronto Fest.  So I had a little talk with her.  She's called the Black Widow.  You know.  Her name's Susan Smith.  She says I could sleep in the car.  That's not her name.  I could sleep in the van. 
[00:45:00]  That's not her name.  No?  But anyway.  It's Paula Yates.  She said I could take a bath.  I'm staying with the Ramsey family in Kielerietto.  I just have to wear a little cowboy hat and cowboy dress.  Son of a bitch.  Andrea, Paula, whatever.  What a douche I am.  I stink.  I do stink.  That was just awful.  So do you know the background of this?  Oh, she's okay.  How do you know? 
[00:45:30]  You thought Eddie was okay.  You thought Eddie was, yeah.  Well, I think I'll be okay.  You know, I go by my gut feeling.  Do you have her phone number?  Yes, I do.  Well, maybe we ought to get her on the phone.  Ask her a couple of questions.  Anthony, we've got to break in because Eddie's on the line.  Oh, is he?  Eddie.  Hey, what's up, guys?  This is indeed Eddie.  Eddie, where are you?  At home.  I had a visit from the New York Finest.  The NYPD?  NYPD?  Yes, sir.  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  And they told me to keep my mouth shut and hire a lawyer.  Keep your mouth shut and hire a lawyer.  Yeah.  What did they ask you, Eddie?  All sorts of questions that I can't devout over the phone.  Devout.  Don't devout it.  Well, whatever.  I'm a little nervous right now, so.  Well, they felt like they didn't need to bring you in, right?  Nope.  Really?  Now, is that bringing you in yet? 
[00:46:30]  Yes, bringing you in yet.  Or are they starting to think that you're just effing nuts?  I think they're going through the books and maybe who the hell knows.  But they tell me to stay off the radio.  You ass.  So what are you doing on the phone?  Well, just to let you know that I can't go on the radio.  You're the first murderer to ever be released on his own recognizance.  Yeah.  And I need a new Wow t-shirt, man. 
[00:47:00]  All right.  They wanted to take me out in this piece of crap.  Eddie.  What?  It's time to confess.  Are you just effing nuts?  No, I'm not effing nuts.  So why didn't they bring you down to the station house?  Yeah, if you killed two people, Eddie.  They just don't want me to say anything on the radio anymore until this is all cleared up.  Are they going to be doing a little more investigating on you, Eddie?  I think so.  How many people came to your apartment? 
[00:47:30]  Three detectives.  Three?  Yes.  And they just felt like there was no problem.  Well, I gave them all the right answers.  You know, they, you know.  Did you tell them that you killed two people, Eddie?  No, I didn't tell them that.  Oh, you didn't confess to your murder?  Not to them.  Now, Eddie, I'm going to ask you something.  I can't answer.  Eddie, I'm going to ask you something.  Eddie, your hands were tied when your wife was divorcing you. 
[00:48:00]  What do you think, my hands were tied when your wife was divorcing you?  Yeah, same thing.  Eddie.  Yeah, but mine could have cost me a lot of money.  Yeah, mine could have cost me years.  Who cares?  Eddie, let me ask you something.  Yes.  Did you kill two people in 1977?  I cannot answer anything, Anthony, please.  Eddie, let me ask you another question.  Were you accurate in your stories of yesterday?  Anthony, I cannot, I can't answer anything.  That's why I'm phrasing it that way. 
[00:48:30]  Anthony, listen.  Eddie, okay, let me ask you this.  How about this?  I'll come down to the station and I'll talk to you off the air.  Let me ask you.  We could do the off-air conversation here on the phone.  We could take you off the air and you will only hear my side of the conversation.  Eddie, you're free to leave your apartment.  Yeah, well, there's a squad car down the block.  That's rare in New York.  Dude, this guy's just out of his mind.  I think he's out of his mind.  Eddie, let me ask you this. 
[00:49:00]  Are you known to be a liar?  No.  No.  Do you tell a lot of lies?  No.  Have you lied recently?  No.  Are you on medication?  No, just for, I had a knee operation, that's it.  What kind of medication are you on?  I'm on Tylenol number three, that's nothing.  Are you delusional?  No.  Have you been in a mental institute?  Nope.  Are you now, or have you ever been homosexual? 
[00:49:30]  No, Norton.  You sick bastard.  Hey, Norton, you better watch yourself.  End up like some Colombian.  Eddie, do you play Grand Theft Auto 3?  No, I don't play none of those games.  I don't even know, I don't even, I have a computer, I don't even know how to put it on.  It's a great game, Eddie.  You would enjoy it.  We should hook him up with a PlayStation 2 in that game.  So, Eddie, the detectives came to see you, they asked you some questions.  They were here about 45 minutes.  They were satisfied with your answers, and you're free to go.  So far. 
[00:50:00]  You don't know how to turn a computer on, but you were brilliant enough to conceal two murders?  Are you sticking to your story, Eddie?  Yep.  You can get yourself in a lot of trouble, you know.  Now you've got the cops involved, the media involved.  I know.  I just saw New York 1.  I couldn't believe it.  They run into the story every half hour.  They sure are, Eddie.  Eddie, Jesus, Eddie.  But, uh, Eddie, I've got to stay off the phone.  Eddie, we're giving you a chance to come clean, because you're going to get yourself screwed 
[00:50:30]  if you're just a nutcase.  Look at Carl from Jersey.  Eddie's nervous little laugh just now was just precious.  It was just precious.  They told me to stay off the phone.  You really scared Patty, too, man.  She was shaking in her mandible.  Oh!  Listen, I wouldn't hurt Patty.  Come on.  Eddie?  Eddie?  I cannot say nothing, Anthony.  Were you on the phone with Pharrell this morning?  Yes.  And you were talking about the Yankees? 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  What was the point you wanted to get across?  I wanted to get across saying that they should get rid of Tory and, you know, let the...  Do you mean get rid of him?  No, not that way.  Oh, okay.  Well, Patty, come on.  How am I supposed to know with you?  When you say get rid of somebody, I'm thinking, you know, Joe Tory.  No, not like getting rid of the track.  Wait a minute.  You think they should get rid of Joe Tory?  Yeah, he doesn't do nothing.  All right.  It's official.  This guy is.  Yeah, now you are crazy.  How stupid are you?  You think that Joe Tory should be fired as Yankee manager? 
[00:51:30]  Well, I think he should be let go because, I mean, he just sits there like a lump on the  wall.  What do you want him to do?  Play center field?  You dope.  He's the manager.  Two murders is one thing.  But now, I think you're crazy.  Eddie, I can't say nothing.  I can't.  I don't want to go on the radio because they're monitoring the radio.  They said.  No, no one's listening to this show today?  Yeah, right.  About you?  Yeah, come on.  The PD's the biggest people that listen to you.  Come on.  Give me a break.  Eddie, this could help your case.  No, it can't.  Hold on. 
[00:52:00]  No, if you're nuts, then just admit that you just made up all this crap to be on our show.  Oh, you got a lot of bigwigs listening to this radio right now.  Look at Bo from Cleveland, man.  Totally getting it.  He goes, oh, and hey, look at Eddie.  Carl Confessor.  Eddie, you're sticking to the story you told us yesterday.  I cannot speak on the phone.  But he did say he is not a liar.  You're not a liar, Eddie.  Right.  That's all I can say. 
[00:52:30]  And when are they coming back?  They're probably knocking on my door right now if I hang up on the phone.  Are you a little paranoid, Eddie?  Yes, now I am.  Wouldn't you?  No.  No, not at all.  You're full of crap.  Eddie, just admit you were lying.  Admit you wanted some fame.  Admit that you want to be on our show.  Would that help my case?  Carl from Jersey says Eddie won't get arrested until they have some evidence.  Otherwise, they can only hold him for 24 hours.  That's what Carl from Jersey says. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, is Carl from Jersey a lawyer?  What's that sound, Eddie?  Oh, I don't want to hear that sound.  What's that sound, Eddie?  Well, listen, you ain't going to be hearing from me for a while.  I'll check in maybe next week, okay?  Medication time.  Medication time.  No, no.  All right?  Well, Eddie, I don't know.  We kind of want to get to the bottom of this.  You don't take any medication.  I'm on town rule number three. 
[00:53:30]  I told you that.  Yeah, but does it come in a pill that says Thorazine on it?  No, it's not.  Give me a break.  Well, I just want to know.  Can you move your hands right now or are you in a straitjacket?  Come on.  Give me a break.  What do you think?  I'm talking on a loudspeaker?  I'm holding the phone.  Eddie, everyone in New York City is talking about you today.  Pretty much everyone in the country that listens to this radio show.  Well, see, you got better ratings.  Do you still drive a truck, Mr. Cheswick? 
[00:54:00]  No, I'm retired.  I put my 20 years in and that was it.  All right, so you're sticking to your story, I guess.  Well, I...  How do you retire after driving a truck?  Did you make some good investments?  Yeah.  What did you invest in?  The company.  Bubblegum Shrimp.  What company did you invest in?  Let's see, Disney, American Airlines.  Let's see. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, yeah, that's a hot one right now, American Airlines.  Well, back then.  Back then.  Back then, Jim.  Dick, Jim.  Leave the murder guy alone.  You sit down.  No, I won't.  Do I have to come down and kick Jim's ass?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  No, not that way.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  You know what Jim looks like, right?  Yeah, I know.  I saw him at the Spider-Man.  He looked good.  Thank you.  Ernie up from Jersey said the cops are pulling a Robert Blake on, Eddie. 
[00:55:00]  Kind of just keep an eye on him.  Yeah, that's what they're going to do.  I forget it.  They're probably going to put a hearing device on my phone, whatever the hell you call it.  They think you'll tap your phone, Eddie?  I don't think...  I don't think they really need to tap your phone.  Yeah.  I think there's a few people listening right now, Eddie.  So why don't you come clean so we can move on?  I can't speak about it.  Angel face.  Listen, it's mom's box. 
[00:55:30]  Remember that.  What?  Is that a code word?  Oh, my God.  People are dying right now because of this code word.  As you told me to say yesterday, mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  That's right.  Joe wants to know if Eddie's playing cards with Nicholson and an Indian chief.  Is that possible?  Are you talking about your wife or talking about your life?  You know, I'm changing my stance on this whole thing.  What are you saying?  I think this guy's absolutely out of his effing mind.  You think he's just a lunatic that made up a story? 
[00:56:00]  Eddie, you're out of your effing mind.  Listen, if you met me, you wouldn't think I'm not out of my mind.  Give me a break.  You're nuts.  Okay, then I'm nuts.  What is it with the name Eddie?  Well, my name is Edward.  They call me Eddie.  Edward?  Edward.  All right, Eddie.  Bob's saying that Eddie said he's going to climb Mount Everest and put a wow sticker on top, too.  How about giving me a new wow shirt?  My wow shirt looks like hell.  Eddie, the opinion is starting to turn here. 
[00:56:30]  A lot of people are just saying you're just a mental case.  You're crazy.  You're out of your mind.  Are you crazy?  That's a good defense.  Have you ever been in a...  No, I've never been institutionalized.  You've never been institutionalized.  No.  Come on, give me a break.  I never got arrested either.  You've never had a nervous breakdown?  No.  Have you been giving Jim your medication?  Who the hell's Jim?  Eddie?  Yes.  Have you ever had major surgery?  I had open heart surgery.  That's about it.  All right. 
[00:57:00]  Did you hurt your back trying to lift the sink to throw it through the window?  No.  And Junk Mill Jerry's saying, Eddie has to be corrected.  Eddie, do you like Juicy Fruit Bubblegum?  Thank you.  I like bazooka.  You're a married man, Eddie.  Yes.  Married man.  23 years.  Married man.  Where's your wife?  We want to talk to your wife.  She's at work.  She had to be corrected along with my children.  She's at work.  Can we call your wife at work? 
[00:57:30]  No.  She'll probably lose her job.  Are you guys still together?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, so she lives with you?  Yeah.  Relax.  Yeah.  I don't think you said that yesterday.  Yeah, you said that you were separated from her.  Yeah, we were separated, but we're still good friends.  She lives here three days out of the week.  I mean, that's still considered living together.  Come on.  What?  Three days out of the week?  Where does she stay?  At her sister's house, out in Patchwork.  And where's your daughter right now? 
[00:58:00]  She's out in Patchwork with my sister-in-law.  So let's talk to your wife.  No, I can't do that, man.  Opie, I can't do that, man.  Well, she's got to know what's going on by now.  Oh, yeah, she knows what's going on.  And what does she think of this whole thing?  She doesn't believe it was me.  She doesn't believe that you killed two guys.  Yeah.  Eddie, what concerns me is how your mother's wife.  Okay, put it this way.  I didn't kill nobody, okay?  Put it that way. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, wait, wait.  Are you saying now you didn't kill anybody?  Yeah, I didn't kill nobody.  So everybody gets off my back, okay?  Well, now are you lying, Eddie?  I'm not saying nothing, anything else, because I'm afraid they might be knocking on my door again.  You're getting paranoid, right?  Yeah, of course I am.  Wouldn't you?  So you thought this was a good idea yesterday, and now you're realizing that a lot of heat's coming down.  Yeah, the heat, of course the heat.  I mean, I have four detectives over here, man.  What the hell do you want me to do?  Three, four.  Three, three. 
[00:59:00]  You want to watch the ball game?  Put your hand up.  I had three detectives and two uniformed officers outside.  What did they think about your place?  They said it was nice and clean.  Did they...  They even checked my refrigerator to see if there was food in it.  Food, or heads.  Eddie, did they have guns out when they came in?  No, no, no.  No, huh?  They were nice guys.  They were just asking a whole bunch of questions like you are.  Eddie, you're just nuts.  Are you just nuts, Eddie? 
[00:59:30]  No, I'm not nuts.  Because you did say yesterday, too, that you told your wife you did this.  So she's known for a very long time.  And now you're saying today that she doesn't believe you killed anybody.  Put it this way, I lied.  Just to keep everybody off my back, I lied, okay?  Eddie, you should be out bird-dogging chicks and banging beaver.  What did you lie about, Eddie?  Eddie, I'm not supposed to be on the radio.  They don't want me on the radio, man.  But you said you lied.  You lied about what? 
[01:00:00]  I'm just saying I lied, okay?  Just for my sake, I lied, okay?  Now you're saying you made up the whole thing.  I lied, okay?  Now he's saying you lied, but I think he's lying when he says he's lying.  Listen, let me go.  Will you send me a new WOW shirt or what, you bastard?  Oh, my God.  Uh-oh.  Better send him one quick.  Yeah, we'll send you a whole box.  You want my address?  I'll give it to Rick.  Eddie's wife is a Chinese delivery boy that he captured and keeps tethered to the bed. 
[01:00:30]  You bet.  Do you want the two girls to bring you the WOW shirt when they hand Scatman Crothers liquor and try to get in the window?  Why don't you deliver them to Norton?  I'm on my knees, brother.  Why don't you deliver them to Norton?  So are they satisfied with what you said today and they're not coming back, Eddie?  I don't know.  And that you're just nuts?  They just told me to stay off the radio.  You just did 20 minutes of radio with us.  I know.  Proving that you're nuts.  Well, can I give you my address off the air so I can get a t-shirt at least out of this? 
[01:01:00]  Before I probably get locked up?  So now you're saying you did all this for a t-shirt.  No.  Listen.  All I want...  He's cracking.  Let's just get him to crack.  I know.  That's what I'm...  Listen.  I cannot be on the phone.  You're cracking on us.  You did all this...  You want me to hang up on you guys?  You did this all for a WOW t-shirt.  No, I didn't.  You're not a loony boy.  You're a fisherman.  And we already have your address. 
[01:01:30]  All right.  Then send it to me, okay?  I'll call you next week once everything settles down.  Is it safe to say that you'll be at this address next week?  I hope so.  Hope so.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  All right.  I don't know.  He's just a nut.  Do I expect my t-shirt then?  Eddie, everyone's starting to say you're just a nut. 
[01:02:00]  That you're just a kook.  That you're a kook.  Listen, I'm not a kook.  Why else would you say you killed two people?  Listen, just...  Only crazy people would get on the radio and say that they killed people and stick to that story.  Just...  Unless they either did it or were crazy.  Okay, then I'm crazy.  You're crazy.  Now you're admitting you're crazy.  Just...  Just...  I just want to get the heat off my back.  All right?  So you think just... 
[01:02:30]  Calling us up today and saying you're crazy that everyone's just going to let this drop.  Yes.  For a while.  So let me get...  Let me get...  You know...  Let me get my senses back.  I mean, you know...  Good luck.  Yeah, I know.  But Rick has my address, right?  Ah, we got your address, your phone number.  All right.  What you've been up to the last 15 years.  We've pretty much got everything.  I'll call you next week.  I don't know from where, but I'll call you next week. 
[01:03:00]  God, this is a great radio tease, huh?  Okay.  All right.  Eddie, you know, I've got to go on record and say I think you're completely nuts.  Right.  All right.  You didn't weigh the chain, did you, Eddie?  No.  I think you got yourself in a lot of trouble, Eddie.  Yeah.  I think you were trying to do something a little wacky, maybe.  And you got yourself in a jam, didn't you?  I'm in a jam as it is.  So, listen.  Let me get off the phone, O&A, all right? 
[01:03:30]  I appreciate what you've done for me.  You do.  What did we do for you?  Well...  You are nuts.  Just take care of Stalker Patty.  Just make sure she don't sleep in the street.  You mean take care of her?  No.  You know what I mean.  Oh, God, because I'm wondering what you mean by that.  Don't let her sleep in the streets or anything, okay?  So we should put her out of her misery?  No.  Come on.  Well, I'm wondering.  Put her up in a hotel or put her someplace up night.  All right, Eddie.  All right? 
[01:04:00]  All right, Eddie.  Frenchy Poole, he's a real pussy.  He didn't call in on this one.  No.  I'll call you next week, all right?  So, Eddie, I'm assuming that the detectives paid a visit and they're happy with what you  had to say and that they're going to go away, right?  I hope so.  Well, there's really no proof.  I mean, they can't find the bodies.  What are they going to do, arrest you with no bodies?  You can't do it.  They can't arrest you.  Oh, Eddie didn't kill anyone.  But they can make my life miserable, though.  Your life sounds miserable.  If you're continuing to live it the way you are, how could they make it worse? 
[01:04:30]  Eddie, you didn't kill anyone, right?  I cannot say, I can't say nothing, okay?  You can't say nothing.  My mom's box, okay?  Well, you can't add okay because then it doesn't work.  All right.  Well, you know what I mean.  But now your last words are, you know what I mean.  Yeah.  I'll speak to you next week.  Next week is the last word you're going to say?  And have a good show. 
[01:05:00]  I'll be listening to you if I'm in the joint.  For what?  They can't lock you up for bad radio.  Well, I'm just afraid because, you know, I've never been in this position before.  Uh-huh.  And what's the position you're in?  Well, cops in front of my door, detectives inside my house.  Eddie, you kind of like it, don't you? 
[01:05:30]  You kind of like the attention?  No, I don't.  Is that it?  No.  Is that why you're lying and saying that you killed two people?  Yeah, I lied, okay?  Just let me go, okay, Ant?  You can go anytime you want to.  All right.  Don't be so depressed about it.  We've all done silly things and then had to confess to them.  It's not a big deal.  Don't feel bad about it.  Who cares?  You killed a little fib.  You're feeling foolish now.  No, I don't feel foolish.  I just feel afraid.  Because you never, ever killed two people. 
[01:06:00]  I feel afraid for my wife and daughter's sake.  You never killed anyone, right?  Yeah.  Just let me go, okay?  I'll call you next week, all right?  If you let me call you.  Yeah, but dude, the important thing is, do you think that Giambi should be playing first  or designated hitting?  You're bad, Norton.  All right, you take it easy, guys, all right?  You didn't answer the question.  I'm asking you a real question. 
[01:06:30]  What do you think?  You're calling for all about sports.  What do you think?  Before you go.  He should be DH.  Yeah, I kind of agree.  All right, you take it easy, guys, all right?  Oh, yes, Eddie.  And I expect my wild t-shirt.  Oh, what are you going to do if you don't get it?  Extra large.  Eddie, Al Cowlings is on the line asking if you need a ride.  I drive faster than he does.  All right, you kook.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Wait, Ed?  Yeah.  There you go. 
[01:07:00]  You got him.  All right.  The guy's out of his mind.  He's out of his mind.  He's a crazy person.  He's a crazy person.  We'll take a break, Anthony.  All right.  All right.  Maybe some of our friends could give us a call and tell us.  I can't talk.  What the F is up?  I can't talk. 
[01:07:30]  I can't talk.  They said not to go on the radio, so what does he do?  He goes on the radio.  He goes on the radio.  I can't talk.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And we're back with the O.P.  and Anthony show.  Jason Newstead, formerly of Metallica, in the building.  We'll be talking to him in a few minutes.  Hell yeah.  EchoBrain is the name of his new band. 
[01:08:00]  We got news crews out the...  The Wazoo?  Yeah.  Yeah, I hear there's another news crew here.  From what, Channel 9?  Yeah.  Ah, John, what's going on?  Oh, I just want to say, Eddie, the code to get the cops off of you is R2-R2-L1-Up-Down-Up-Down.  Thank you.  Okay, bye.  It's a code for Grand Theft Auto 3. 
[01:08:30]  Ah, that was great.  Let's go to Steve.  Hey, Steve, what's going on, man?  Howdy.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up, man?  Okay, I have proof that this guy's a fraud.  All right.  All right.  We're starting to think that ourselves now.  He said the crime was committed in 1977 when he was 22 years old.  Right.  He'd be 19 years old.  He needs to learn how to do math.  No, did he say...  No, he said he was just out of high school.  Yeah, but he said he was 22 years old. 
[01:09:00]  He said he was married at the age of 21, also because he's been married for 23 years.  And this is something which I don't get either.  He said it was right after the first murder of the son of Sam in 1977.  Right.  When?  For proof I have, the son of Sam did it in 76.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh, ho.  Also, dude, I think that the Parkland testimony was different than that of Bethesda Naval Hospital.  And remember, this is coming from Team Taron of White Trash Family Crime Solvers. 
[01:09:30]  Ah.  Ah, there you go.  Number three, right?  Jell-O is not made from the parts from the meat district.  They breed their own animals and use their own products.  Okay.  Hey, Steve, thank you.  Okay.  For all that info.  Yes, and here's another thing.  Yeah.  The bags of meat in the district get emptied.  They can tell the difference between human teeth and cow and pig teeth because we have incisors and everything,  but they just have molars because they're herbivores when we are part carnivores, and they would notice that. 
[01:10:00]  Boy, you learn something new every ding-dong day.  Hey, I'm just trying to help out the NYPD here and, like, save them plenty of money and man hours.  There you go.  Thank you, Steve.  Nor can you rule.  Thanks, brother.  All right.  Let's go to Mark.  Hey, Mark, what's going on, man?  Nothing.  What's going on?  You tell me.  I thought that guy was serious, but after all those facts, I don't know anymore.  I just hope they don't make a movie called The Radio Killer and open Anthony.  You quack.  I wouldn't worry about it.  All right, Mark.  Thank you.  Hey, Norton. 
[01:10:30]  I hate you.  You suck.  It's never going to work.  People are so angry with themselves when it doesn't pan out.  He knew it wasn't going to work, so he had to throw it out.  Yeah.  All right.  Now we've got Channel 9 News that wants to come in here.  Why don't we invite him in?  Why not?  Sure.  We'll speak with anybody on these very airwaves.  The latest, we think, Eddie the Murderer is an absolute kook.  There you are.  How are you doing?  How are you?  Good.  Yourself?  Good.  The serious news reporter.  I know. 
[01:11:00]  The serious news reporter.  I watch.  Sure.  Bob O'Brien.  Bob O'Brien, of course.  Channel 9.  Formerly Channel 5.  Yeah, that's right.  But they're all one company, so.  One happy family, huh?  Got transferred over to the Meadowlands.  There you go.  Channel 9 here in New York.  Setting up your camera as we speak.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, listen.  Yeah.  Listen, I'm a cop in East New York.  Listen, me, my partner, and this guy we call the sleeve locked him up.  He's a liar.  His name's not Eddie.  I know his name.  I know what car he drives.  We locked him up about last month. 
[01:11:30]  Well, I know they did find out his name was Eddie.  I mean, his name is Eddie.  No, his name's not Eddie.  His name's John.  All right.  Thank you, John.  The guy's a retard.  Well, Eddie just was on hold, and then he hung up real fast.  What happened?  I don't know.  Interesting.  SP from New Jersey writes on the Instant Feedback.  Ask Eddie if he's wearing an iPad.  Catch.  Well, I don't know.  As of now, I don't know. 
[01:12:00]  As of now, you've got to think he's a mental patient.  The guy's some kind of a mental patient who probably should stay off the radio for his own good.  I mean, hell.  We enjoy the hell out of it.  I mean, fine.  You want to come on these airwaves and spew whatever you want?  We're fine with it.  But you've got to realize there's going to be some consequences.  The police will come to your house and ask you questions.  Bob O'Brien just gave us a weird look.  Perhaps lock you up. 
[01:12:30]  What's up there, Bob?  What do you mean you think he's a kook?  Well, we could say the situation is fluid.  We don't quite know.  Boy, you know something?  This is very good.  I feel New York is getting back.  We are getting back to normal after the September 11th tragedy.  When news cameras are back in this studio, I'll be for silly things.  For dopey radio show stuff.  Sweet.  It makes me feel better about what's going on. 
[01:13:00]  Well, I'm hoping Eddie calls back.  Yeah, maybe we could.  That would be great if Eddie calls back when you guys are here doing the story.  A little quote from him.  You could ask him questions.  I just heard him on the radio when we were driving here.  Yeah.  He comes off sounding a little odd, doesn't he?  He does come off sounding like he's missing some teeth.  You did notice that.  Perhaps he could use a dentist or something.  Look at Bob O'Brien doing shtick, Anthony. 
[01:13:30]  Forensic dental shtick.  Yeah, check his dental records.  He's not only a reporter.  He does shtick.  Yeah.  Well, you have any questions for us?  I do.  I mean, when you got this call yesterday, who took it?  No, I can get out of my shot.  Could you please?  Who got out?  What happened, Bob?  Who got the call yesterday?  Well, it's the Opie and Anthony show, and we take the calls together.  Yeah, we both got the call from Eddie.  When he said he killed two people, what did you think?  Pretty shocking.  You know, we're not used to people admitting to murders on this program. 
[01:14:00]  And he sounded crazy enough that he might have done it.  He also sounded crazy enough that he might be delusional in believing that he did it.  But we're not detectives.  Yeah.  What do you think, Opie, after this last call that he just made to you?  I got to say, I think the guy's just a kook.  You don't believe he did it?  I'm not buying it anymore.  Yeah, now I'm thinking he might be more of a kook than a murderer.  He's somebody that maybe in his mind he believes he did it.  Maybe he's just a nut with these delusions. 
[01:14:30]  And, yeah, the cops will sort it out.  They'll figure it out.  Yeah, the K-Squad has had some detectives over at his apartment, I understand.  Yeah, yeah.  He said three detectives and a couple of uniformed cops were there today or yesterday.  Yeah, today.  Today.  Just about an hour ago.  Yeah.  And they spoke with him and told him, what was the quote?  To get a lawyer and shut up.  And don't go back on the radio.  Which he told us live on the radio.  Right. 
[01:15:00]  That's why I think he's a kook because he tells us all this live on the radio.  One ranking police friend said that there's one part of Eddie's story that he thinks is total BS.  He says nobody burns a body and then moves it.  It's too much of a mess.  And they're saying, Eddie says they burned the body, then they put some parts of the body into plastic bags and threw it in the meat market.  That sounds a little odd, doesn't it?  And you ever pick up a burned body?  I could say no.  I've never, never been involved in any type of murder. 
[01:15:30]  That's not our expertise.  And picking up of bodies.  But you know something?  That is a great point.  I watch enough Discovery Channel, Opie.  I know when a body's burned, it kind of leaves a big, fatty, burnt-up, bony mess.  That's probably a little rough to move.  Yeah.  Plus all the disease and yuck.  Yeah, you wouldn't even want to...  Did Bob O'Brien just say yuck on our radio show?  Stop with this journalistic jargon you're using.  Why UK yuck?  Like yuck.  It's really interesting.  He says these murders happened in 1977, right?  77.  You know, that, of course, was the summer of Sam. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  And...  We just learned that the summer of Sam started in 76.  Yeah, that's what somebody was saying.  It did, right?  It did, yeah.  But the summer he was caught was 1977.  77, right.  And tonight on Channel 9, by the way, Matthew Schwartz, one of our investigative IT reporters,  has a protracted interview with David Berkowitz.  Are you kidding me?  No, he just came back from the state prison where Berkowitz is.  And you're going to hear and see the real son of Sam, a real murderer of six people, wounded 
[01:16:30]  seven, who's going to talk about what life is like now and whether or not he's going  to go for parole.  You know, he's up for parole.  I did know that, but I doubt he will get paroled.  Is he calling radio shows, by the way?  I haven't heard about that, no.  Well, that would be a coup.  He is going to talk to Matthew Schwartz on Channel 9 tonight at 10 o'clock.  Well, tune in for that.  If you want to see a real killer.  Bob O'Brien, I'm going to give you an exclusive.  Eddie is calling us right now.  Eddie is here.  Let's see what he has to say.  Eddie.  Hey, what's up?  You got Channel 9 News listening to you right now. 
[01:17:00]  All right.  I'm a kook, and I'm on Zolwoff.  That's all I got to say.  Okay?  Bye.  Eddie.  Good luck, Antonix Lewis.  That's his exclusive.  That's his statement there, Bob.  Run with it.  Run with it.  I'm a kook, and I'm on Zoloft, is what he said.  Zoloft.  You're an experienced journalist.  Decifer that and go with it, Bob.  Zoloft.  Zoloft doesn't make you kill.  Zoloft makes you lay down.  Was that Eddie or Mike Tyson, though?  Because he had that same, like, lisp sound. 
[01:17:30]  No, his voice was too deep for Mike Tyson.  Too deep.  We got Tyson audio here.  Mike Tyson talks so good.  Saying the same thing about the Zoloft.  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  Yeah.  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all.  Oh, well.  See?  To prevent people from killing, so perhaps he had a problem.  I think he's a nut.  I think he's a kook.  And, you know, whatever.  It sounded like somebody who could have committed this kind of crime. 
[01:18:00]  But the more we talked to him, especially today, it just, he's coming off like a nut.  Hey, he's calling back.  What?  He's back again?  Yeah, I don't think.  Another exclusive.  No, Rick got me back.  I don't think he was satisfied with his statement there.  Eddie.  Eddie, Bob O'Brien, a real journalist, wants to talk to you.  Hey, Eddie.  Rick called me.  All right.  That's fine.  Yes, Eddie.  Eddie, are you saying that you didn't kill two people?  Yes, I didn't kill two people, okay?  Would you like to ask him a couple of questions? 
[01:18:30]  I don't want to answer no more.  That's all I got to say.  Well, hold on.  This is for the news.  I don't care.  I didn't kill two people, and that's it, okay?  Then why did you make this up?  Because I'm a kook, and I'm on Zoloft, okay?  All right.  Bye.  Eddie, did you ever touch a burned body?  Bye.  A burned body?  He hung up.  They always hang up when you ask them about burned bodies.  Well, I'm sold.  He's not a murderer.  He just said he's a kook, he's on the Zoloft, and he didn't kill two people is what he said.  All right. 
[01:19:00]  There you go.  Listen, he's doing all this just to get a Wow T-shirt, and this is Whip Him Out Wednesday, right?  It is indeed Whip Him Out Wednesday.  See how proud you are of the Son of Sam, the David Berkowitz interview that you have going tonight.  We are proud of Whip Him Out Wednesday, Wow, on every Wednesday.  Yes.  Listen, my son is a freshman in college in Philadelphia, where they listen to you down there.  Of course, on WISP.  And you guys are coast to coast now, right?  Yes.  You're making enormous money. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, it's just sick.  Well, look at us.  You've got the TV camera here.  He doesn't want to kill anybody, but he wants me.  He'll kill me.  He's a karate guy, you know?  If I don't come home with one of these Wow T-shirts.  All right.  All right.  Hook him up.  Hook him up, Rick.  Hook me up with the Wow T-shirts.  Of course.  I can face my son, Sean.  We have another confession coming in there, Bob, if I can interrupt you.  Just Eddie?  Yuri.  Yeah.  What's going on, guys?  I have two confessions to make.  Yes.  A, I'm 23, and I'm the one who stole the Lindbergh baby.  And in 77, I stole Richard Voss' sent to humor. 
[01:20:00]  Poor Richard Voss.  I feel bad for the guy, but I got it now.  All right.  Thank you, Yuri.  You got it.  Confession.  Well, there it is.  We've blown the lid off of this one, Bob.  Let's ask Bob.  Bob, what are you thinking?  I think that I'm going to wait to see.  I'm going to go over and see if I can find Eddie myself.  Oh.  Wow.  You know, you always can tell them better if you're looking someone in the eye.  Straight in the eye.  I always know that somebody's lying.  Right.  If when they're talking to you and saying something, they won't look, they won't catch your gaze. 
[01:20:30]  They won't look you in the eye.  So I want to look him in the eye.  Look him in the eye.  Let's just look at him.  I want to look in the eyes and ask him.  All right.  You do that.  A kook or a killer.  What time is the Berkowitz interview?  Berkowitz interview, 10 o'clock tonight on Channel 9.  There you go.  W-W-O-R.  U-P-N-9.  Can you read transcripts of that on eatabullet.com?  No, but you're probably going to be able to see it on our website.  Very good.  Thank you, guys.  Well, thank you very much.  And, you know, you're great Americans if, in fact, you're doing America's Most Wanted thing here. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, that's what we're changing this show into.  America's Most Wanted.  I think we're doing a circus act, Bob.  America's Most Kooky.  It's a three-ring circus here in the studio today.  All right, boys.  We just don't want to look ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  No, you guys are ridiculous.  We're starting to look ridiculous.  Nah.  All right.  The guy turns out he's a kook, you know?  What are you going to do?  There's a million of them out there.  Yes, there are.  At least.  Get your cameras out there and find some.  All right.  See you.  All right.  There goes Bob O'Brien and UPN Channel 9 here in New York. 
[01:21:30]  There they go.  Thank you, gents.  Take care.  Have a good afternoon.  See you.  Oh, Bob.  Backing up there really quick.  Don't care, Bob.  There's more.  You hear all those people out there?  That's all news crews.  What's the big to-do?  The big to-do?  They're not.  Don't interview Patty, Bob.  Oh, Patty.  Go ahead.  Have fun with her.  You'll love her. 
[01:22:00]  She was the one that was going to stay with this nut overnight.  And she was crying and almost fainted.  I want to see Patty's face on TV.  I'm starting to think it's a slow news day.  Hey, man.  Thank God.  All right.  Enough of the tragedy.  Look at her tragedy.  Go talk to Bob.  Stark or Patty?  Come here, Cameron.  Patty.  Hey, they're going to interview you now, okay?  Yeah.  All right.  All right?  Okay.  Go ahead.  Go talk to the news.  Oh, Patty. 
[01:22:30]  There we go.  Wow.  How about that, Opie?  They ain't going to run any of that.  Because they're starting to look ridiculous just like us.  They've been roped in by this nut.  What happened?  I'm just so glad that someone could pull tape from yesterday's show where we said, look,  the guy either did it or he's very delusional.  Right.  Thank God that's on the record.  But we still look ridiculous.  I know. 
[01:23:00]  I don't know how that happened.  Oh, well.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  Reductant.  Ozzy's in the city today, Anthony, and he's checking in.  Ozzy!  Hey, guys.  How are you guys?  Hello, Mr. Osborne.  What's up, Ozzy?  Oh, no.  Not much.  I haven't talked to you guys in a while.  I want to see how you guys are doing.  I turn on the radio and you've got a killer calling the show.  Well, we all know that Ozzy loves the Opiate Anthony show. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, absolutely, man.  Yeah.  So, what's going on today, Oz?  Not much.  I just took a helicopter in California.  We're in a helicopter in California?  Yeah.  I had to get some stuff from my house so I could shoot the next season or the other ones.  You know?  Right.  I hear that you've picked up another season.  Oh, yeah.  I also learned... 
[01:24:00]  In case you guys never learn anything from me, you know, I want you to know, never take a laxative and sleeping pill on the same flight.  It doesn't work.  It was like flying at Little Box, you know.  Yeah.  Ozzy, we hear that you guys are going to announce today in New York City that there's going to be a second season of the Osborgs.  Absolutely.  And how do you feel about Kelly singing Papa Don't Preach?  Well, you know, she doesn't have as good a voice as her father does, you know. 
[01:24:30]  But, you know, if you see my daughter, I wish her best of luck to her, you know.  Right.  I think she'll do all right.  You know, having the last name Osborne can hurt, you know.  Oh, can it?  Ozzy, we might have to cut this interview short because now Fox 5 wants to talk to the boys.  Fox 5.  It's okay, guys.  Hold on.  Hold on a second, Oz.  And I read Bob O'Brien's mind, by the way.  Yeah. 
[01:25:00]  He looked at both of us and went, ah, these guys have nothing.  They have nothing.  You have nothing.  Let's have...  Now, Opie, Fox is fun.  Yeah.  Right?  They're very upstation.  Are they right out there?  They're on their way down the stairs.  Oh, they are.  What reporter?  Not sure yet.  We'll see when they walk in.  Oh.  Ozzy.  Yeah.  All right.  We only got a couple minutes with you because we got Fox.  It's all right, guys.  I understand.  You guys are going to be filming the new season over in England, right?  Right.  In my farmhouse in England. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  I think it should be fun.  If you like the first season, I think it should be very good.  You know?  Right.  It should be fun.  I just hope everybody will watch again, you know?  All right.  Well, I think they will, Ozzy.  Ozzy, you want to confess to anything?  Um, you know, I'm crazy.  That's not really a confession, you know?  But I just want to confess that you guys are my angels, and I love you very much. 
[01:26:00]  You're not on the Zoloft, are you?  No, no, no Zoloft for me, you know?  Hey, can you give us one?  Sharon!  Get away!  All right, Oz.  All right, I'll tell you to you guys.  Have fun with your announcement today.  Thank you.  Ozzy?  No, not going to work, you bastard.  There goes Oz.  Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I can't follow Ozzy.  Hey.  Hey, it's just nice to hear Bob O'Brien quoting Mr. Miyagi.  Yeah, yeah.  Look I.  Always look I. 
[01:26:30]  Always look I.  Yeah.  Later.  All right.  He was like, yeah, looking at us, the camera guys kind of taping and just, oh.  Hey, Tom the cop from yesterday is checking back in.  Tom?  I guess I'm not making detective, huh?  I don't know.  You hope this is going to be it?  Oh, sucks for me.  It's starting to look like this guy is just absolutely out of his mind.  Like there's not enough freaks out there.  I couldn't land a good murderer just from listening to it all in a.  There you go. 
[01:27:00]  All right, Tom.  That's going to make a sweep, huh?  All right, cool.  Let me, uh, why don't we take a break, Ed?  All right, we can do that and then we'll have Fox come in.  Yeah, and we'll look ridiculous for them, too.  Good.  Andrea Day from Fox.  Oh.  Cool.  Sending the heavyweight.  Nice.  I guess everyone wants to interview, uh, James, uh, uh, Jason Newstead. 
[01:27:30]  Yes.  From Metallica.  Formerly of Metallica.  He's waiting outside to come in and, uh, do a little hang with us today.  But, uh, we're trying to get to the bottom of this Eddie thing.  This ridiculous Eddie thing.  Uh, Eddie, who called up yesterday and, uh, confessed to double homicide back in 1977.  He said he was with a friend, uh, they were on a drug deal, uh, the drug deal went bad and  he killed, uh, two of the guys that he was, uh, going to be making this drug deal with. 
[01:28:00]  Well, uh, the police got involved.  They, uh, took a little trip and visited Eddie.  And, um, now Eddie's been calling us back and saying, uh, maybe this didn't happen.  Maybe it's the Zoloft that he's on.  Maybe Eddie is just a kook.  You know?  But he did sound, yesterday, he sounded like a guy that might be capable of doing this.  You know?  He sounded like a kook.  A madman.  And, uh, so you're kind of like a kook. 
[01:28:30]  You take it at face value, maybe.  You go, all right, the guy's confessing to murder.  What are we going to say?  No, you didn't.  But when did he really start to sound like a kook in your mind?  Um, well, right when he said that murder was, uh, what he committed.  You know, we were saying, oh, he said he'd done some bad things in his life.  So you're just talking normally, right?  Yeah, we're just kind of carrying on a little conversation.  He goes, yeah, I did some bad things in, uh, the past.  We're like, okay, what is it?  A little shoplifting or something like that?  And he said, murder.  We're like, oh, hmm, that's a little rough. 
[01:29:00]  You know, that's a little, uh, drastic.  And then he went into detail.  He starts talking about how in 77, the drug dealer, he shot him, burnt their bodies,  uh, threw the body parts out the window.  And, uh, the police got on this and said, all right, we'll check this out.  So they went over the house, and then we got a call from them that said, uh, the cops  were there, and then they left and didn't arrest them.  So now we're thinking, all right, if the cops talked to them, they must have said, all right,  this guy's just a kook or something.  And what's the latest from the cops?  Uh, the latest, we haven't heard from the cops yet.  We're eagerly awaiting word from the police to see, uh, what this guy's all about. 
[01:29:30]  But it's kind of sounding like, yeah, he's a little kooky.  Maybe he believes he did this.  Uh, but to us now, it's sounding like, all right, this guy's a joker.  Well, maybe Eddie can call in.  Hey, where's Eddie?  Uh, Rick, get Eddie on the phone, because we're getting an exclusive.  We're getting an exclusive for everybody.  We're getting an exclusive every five minutes.  We got Fox.  We got Fox in the studio.  Is this for real now?  Is this some kind of a stunt that you guys are pulling?  No, we, uh, we've learned our lesson about, uh, radio hoaxes and dead people. 
[01:30:00]  Just ask Mayor Menino up in Boston.  Um, we absolutely, definitely are not pulling a hoax here.  You know, this guy called up.  Uh, did we think that he killed two people?  We were saying, yeah, he either did it or he's crazy and thinks he did it.  You know, we never got on and said, uh, this guy absolutely killed people.  Uh, if he was pulling a hoax, that's one thing.  Uh, I think he's just a nut.  But, uh, did we set this up or anything?  No, absolutely not.  That's bizarre. 
[01:30:30]  We would never do such a thing.  You definitely learned your lesson before on that one.  We've learned our lesson.  We're not that smart.  In Boston.  Yeah, we're not that smart.  We're just not that smart when it comes down to it.  What went through your mind when this guy calls in and all of a sudden he says, you know,  murder and talks about burning bodies?  Um, well, it was off.  It was off.  No, I'm going to kill you.  What did Jim just do?  He starts making the universal, uh, language of jerking off, which was a bit much.  That might be what you did.  Ignore that man. 
[01:31:00]  Ignore that silly man over there.  It was a bit, uh, it was a shock when you first hear it because the guy kind of sounded  like the guy that might be capable of this.  He had that creepy voice, you know what I mean?  So, uh, we just, no, we kind of dug deeper and he got a bunch of details out.  So we're like, eh, you know, who are we to say he didn't do it or did do it?  Let the cops, uh, sort it out.  He wouldn't get off the phone to tell you the truth.  He had an answer for every question we asked him yesterday.  So.  Now, what's weird though is you guys have heard of this guy before. 
[01:31:30]  He had been involved with, uh, Ron and Fez who do the show in New York here after us.  And we're finding out today that he did stuff on the morning show here at, uh, WWE.  It was the first time we've heard this guy before.  We call them in the business radio whores.  But not on our show.  I mean, yesterday was the first time we, uh, I believe we talked to him.  Yeah, we were the one that got the golden nugget.  Him confessing the double homicide.  All the other shows are very pissed off because I guess he's a regular caller on all their shows.  And they never, uh, he never fessed up on their shows.  So, uh.  So I think we should invite him down to the studio. 
[01:32:00]  Invite him down?  How about invite him down to your Fox News studios?  Because I don't want this kook anywhere near us, man.  He did say he was on his way over here.  He did?  Yeah, because he wanted to get, he wants to get his wow shirt.  Yeah, he wants a wow t-shirt.  That's, I don't know if that was his intention, but.  I don't know if that was his intention, but.  I don't know if that was his guy for real.  That's my guy.  Yeah, I'm starting to think he's a kook.  No, he's absolutely a nut, you know.  You think he made the whole thing up?  Uh, yeah, it's looking like that now.  Like he, uh, probably made this up.  I don't know, to get attention, maybe he's a kook. 
[01:32:30]  And again, like I said, maybe, maybe he thinks he did this, or he wishes he did it, or something, so.  Some kind of nut job.  Yeah, nut.  Like that guy over there.  I told you not to film him.  Do you have anything to add, Jim?  Anything, Jim.  Nothing?  Um, no, I'm just hoping that my curtains are done properly.  I was buying curtains yesterday.  You know that he's in the new Spider-Man movie?  Yeah, he's the guy.  Do your line, do your line.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  He plays the surly truck driver.  He's in for two seconds. 
[01:33:00]  I was kind of like a sidekick.  That was his big claim to fame.  Yes, his big claim to fame.  Did you speak with stalker Patty, who was actually, broke this story wide open yesterday?  No, we didn't.  She was the one.  She's a homeless gal.  Right, she calls in all the time.  Yeah, she calls in.  She's a pain in the ass.  But you love her.  She's homeless.  No, we don't.  She needed a place to live.  She somehow had hooked up with this Eddie guy, and was going to stay at his house.  When we found out that he had been saying he killed people, Patty then said she wasn't 
[01:33:30]  going to stay there, and she was very afraid.  I bet.  Yes.  Where is Patty?  Bring Patty in so you can get a load of this girl.  And we're trying to get Eddie.  We're kind of...  Patty's actually out there.  That's Patty right there.  You see her?  Wow.  Say hi, Patty.  Hi.  Hi.  She was so nervous yesterday.  Weren't you, Patty?  Yeah.  You were scared, weren't you?  Yes, I was.  So tell us about this guy.  Yeah, go over and talk to Patty.  Tell us about this weird guy.  Well, he didn't come across as exactly sane, and I'm not going to go to the home of someone 
[01:34:00]  who says they murdered people.  And look who's saying that, huh?  Hello?  So the bottom line, you think he killed somebody?  Who's to say?  There's an exclusive.  Who's to say?  Who's to say?  Who's to say?  Fascinating.  Expose.  Very exciting, guys.  Thank you.  Yes.  So you're sure you're not making this one up?  No, this is not one of our gags or anything.  You couldn't get this smart?  No. 
[01:34:30]  It's kind of stupid if you come up with a fake...  We can't write an material like this.  We just roll whatever happens.  This happened to a pop-up on us on the phones yesterday, and we just went with it.  What about the burning bodies and then picking it up afterwards?  I mean, what's that stuff?  Yeah, he said that after he had killed these Colombian drug dealers that he burnt their  bodies up.  And then that wasn't good enough, so he picked up the burnt parts and sprinkled them around  Manhattan, threw some...  So he waited around after they were burnt, you know, comes back.  Yeah, yeah.  Came back and decided then he was going to sprinkle them around New York and put them 
[01:35:00]  in dumpsters from the meatpacking district, you know, with the various other meat parts  from animals.  And, you know, like Patty said, who's to say?  Who's to say it didn't happen?  Right, Petty?  Right.  Do you have a home for Patty where you...  She needs a place to live.  She still needs a home.  You know how you do that on Fox sometimes?  Problem solvers.  Problem solvers.  Or sometimes I see, there's a little dog that needs your help. 
[01:35:30]  He needs adoption.  And you show the dog, it's a cute face, and someone adopts it.  Look at that one we got over there.  Could somebody please adopt this pet?  She doesn't eat much, right?  You can tell by how skinny she is.  I think she's offended.  Is she offended?  No, she is such a great friend of the show.  And look how hot she looks without a bra.  Oh, Opie.  Be nice to Patty.  They're funny, aren't they?  What?  Funny how.  Oh, funny. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, of course.  Well, is Eddie...  Can we get through to Eddie?  No.  Rick can't get Eddie.  What happened?  I've left him three very long messages so far.  He's not picking up his phone.  He's not picking up his phone.  He even offered to have you guys sign the t-shirts that we send him, but...  He's bribing this nut.  Maybe he's on his way down here.  He's a total kook.  Yeah, that's what it sounds like.  We've been saying that for the last hour now.  So we're thinking maybe...  He didn't do anything, right?  I am thinking now that he did not kill two people.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He sounds like just your run-of-the-mill nut, not your murderous nut. 
[01:36:30]  That is probably the end of this story, I would say.  And this all started because Patty got booted out of her house because of the money snatch  competition.  No, let's not go there today.  He said he didn't do anything.  Yeah.  Right.  They booted her out of her house because she wanted to be in an Opie and Anthony Contest.  It was a cute little contest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know!  That bastard!  We're going to try one more time.  What does it take to get a kook on the phone these days?  Yeah, right?  I'm sure he wants the airtime.  Of course he does. 
[01:37:00]  Why else would he have said he killed two people?  It's an attention getter or something.  Right, exactly.  Is that what you're thinking, maybe?  I'm thinking maybe you guys are trying to get attention.  No!  You know something?  We're not going to crack.  We did not plan this.  We didn't do it.  We didn't come up with this.  You know what happened in Boston?  We said the mayor of Boston was dead and we got fired.  No.  What made you do that kind of thing?  It was Opie that did it.  I was along for the ride.  I was so young in my radio career, I was willing to go along with anything. 
[01:37:30]  I was just in a bad mood that day.  And we went on the air, but it was April Fool's Day.  It was April Fool's Day.  So Opie decides, let's say Mayor Menino of Boston is dead.  And he was coming back from Florida at the time.  And he was on a plane so no one could get in touch with him to confirm that he wasn't dead.  And we got in trouble.  A week later we were fired.  And look at where they brought us.  This place.  Jump.  I thought it was a cute little idea.  A few minutes ago you love this place down here. 
[01:38:00]  No, we like it here.  Yeah.  We're from here, so.  We're not going to get it.  We're not going to get it, Eddie.  I'm sorry.  He gave an exclusive to Channel 9, but maybe he's just not a Fox fan.  And what was his sound bite for Channel 9?  He did say, I could quote him.  He said, I'm a kook and I'm on Zoloft.  That's my quote and he hung up on us.  He's not worth talking about.  Right.  Yeah.  But we did not put this together. 
[01:38:30]  Wait, I can assure you.  Let me go to Al.  Hey, Al, what's up?  Oh, come on.  That phone call you guys here, Scott?  Yeah.  Eddie is freaking out right now.  This guy is sitting in a corner, chewing his fingernails, holding his shotgun, wondering  whether or not to put it in his mouth right now.  He thinks the cops are on to him and they're going to find him now.  We can't.  We think he's a nut.  No way.  We have to go on the record and say that.  I went to that whole thing yesterday with you guys.  This guy, there's no way a nut could be that in-depth in what was going on. 
[01:39:00]  All right.  Down to where they were, what it looked like, what the lights were like.  No nut would think about it like that.  Sure they would if that's all you do all day.  Well, I don't know.  Well, who knows if that's what he does.  I don't know.  All right.  And then when he called in before, he sounded way too scared.  Wow, he's nervous.  He sounded like he's coming up with, like, I'm on Zoloff, I'm crazy, leave me alone,  so the cops will leave me alone.  He didn't realize he was going to get this much attention, Al.  Right.  I don't think so.  All right.  I don't think he realized he was going to get that much attention, but I think he did it. 
[01:39:30]  Now he's panicking, like, oh, my God, what did I do?  I mean, this news is all over the place.  Now he's sitting in the corner with a gun, wondering whether or not to put it in his mouth or not.  All right, Al.  Thank you.  No problem.  We have to get to what Jason Neustod did.  This is crazy.  This is crazy that we're going on with this.  So I'm sorry we couldn't get Eddie on the phone for you.  No problem.  Yeah.  And take care.  You too.  Nice to see you.  Nice to see you too.  She's looking at us too going, they have nothing.  They have nothing.  They have nothing.  Bastards.  Nothing.  I'm not going to admit to this.  Of course not. 
[01:40:00]  Was it a slow news day today?  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah, nothing really going on.  I'm with you on that.  I'm totally with you there.  I just wanted to make sure you guys didn't, you know, pull this.  No, we did not do this.  We'll let you know if we pull something.  Yeah.  We really, no.  We don't do that kind of thing.  Yeah, we usually let people in on the gag afterwards.  Yeah.  We're too stupid.  We're too bad of actors to come off legit.  Time will go by and you'll get nothing.  This is what it is.  That's stupid.  It's exciting in here, I've got to tell you. 
[01:40:30]  There's a lot going on.  Yeah.  It's kind of fun, right?  Yeah.  You come down and hang out sometime.  All right, guys.  All right.  There they go.  Fox 5 News here in New York.  And they're calling Eddie like crazy, but he's now not answering his phone in.  Any specials you guys want to plug for Fox 5?  Everyone seems to be plugging something today.  Because Channel 9 had their Son of Sam interview that they have today.  And it is May Sweepsie.  What do you guys have?  Grab that mic.  Oh, that one's good.  Oh, good.  Either one. 
[01:41:00]  I'll tell you what.  You just have to watch Fox every night because Fox 5 Problem Solvers, we're out solving problems.  I love the Problem Solvers.  Getting all the guys who are ripping people off.  Because they stick cameras in people's faces and get them so pissed off.  And it is so much fun to watch people get annoyed.  And then they get the hand in the face and they go, get away from me.  Don't take me.  And they just look guilty, guilty, guilty.  Right.  But it's good that we're tracking them down and catching them.  Helping people out.  Helping people out.  It always seems that the people have tried so hard.  I've tried for a year to get this problem taken care of. 
[01:41:30]  You guys, one camera, problem solved.  Problem Solvers.  It's a lot of fun.  There you go.  Could you guys on Problem Solvers help a man with pale skin and blubbery breasts that can't meet a hot girl?  I don't know.  Maybe write in and we'll see what we can do.  All right.  There they go.  Fox News, Ant.  Should have Problem Solvers for this station.  Maybe some of the day parts.  Any suggestions? 
[01:42:00]  Okay.  We're going to take a break.  Some of them are hot.  We're going to start our radio show next, I think.  Are we at 518?  Now that we've talked to every news crew in New York.  I believe that's it.  Jason Newstead coming in next.  Yes.  His new band is called Echo Brain.  And we'll see what it's all about, okay?  Cool.  And we'll ask him about Metallica and all that as well.  Yes.  So stay there.  Thank you.  Hey, it's the Retired of Laverne and Shirley.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony on 94 WISP. 
[01:42:30]  Jason Newstead's new band, Anthony.  Yeah.  Colder world.  Really fast before we get Jason in here.  Fox, as they were leaving, started interviewing Rick.  Uh-oh.  What are they talking about, Rick?  She was asking me if this was some kind of hoax that was perpetrated by you guys.  A gun, she's asking.  Yeah, they're trying.  At that point, I handed her off to Ken Stevens.  Oh.  I thought you were out there saying,  Look, if you haven't killed anyone in the first 20 minutes, 
[01:43:00]  maybe you should go somewhere else and kill somebody.  No?  You didn't say that, Rick?  No, I didn't say that.  Look who is in the studio.  Rick, relinquish that mic to Jason Newstead.  Yeah, we're about to start our radio show for today.  So you guys are finally going to start it.  Yeah, I know.  We made Jason Newstead wait about an hour.  It's ridiculous.  We did silly news interviews.  We apologize.  And my boys, Dylan Duncan and Brian Sagrafinna,  making up Echo Brainers over here with me too, you know. 
[01:43:30]  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Yeah, it's been a little sick here today.  Did you take all that in out there, Jason?  Yeah.  With the news crews and stuff?  Yeah.  You know what I was kind of confused about?  Yes, so were we.  Like, everybody's making this big deal about this kind of thing.  We're taking fools out left and right all the time, man.  I feed them to my dogs later and nobody knows nothing.  See?  So what's the big deal?  Jason, are you confessing to murder here on our show?  Wow.  No, I'm not confessing to nothing.  I'm not confessing to nothing.  I'm just wondering what the big deal is about taking people out when they piss you off, man. 
[01:44:00]  You know what I mean?  My dogs have a good appetite.  There's nothing left over.  It seems like the guy legitimately had a beef with some Colombians, and why not?  Take him out.  We're starting to think he's a cook.  So we're happy that you guys were cool enough to have us down here.  Who's not going to talk to you?  You guys.  Come on.  I mean, you know, it's just starting off for us and everything.  We're trying to get off on a good foot, and I'm really pleased that a lot of people are coming out to help.  I was going to say, what a start, man.  You got a nice buzz on this Echo Brain. 
[01:44:30]  That's true, dude.  People have been showing up, and the band has been playing really good.  Yeah.  I'm not, it's hard for me to get perspective of any kind at this level.  Well, what you have to base it on, too, what you've been in.  And that's all I have to base it on, really, because I went from Flotsam, where, you know, 200 seats, and then right to Metallica.  And I really did this middle stage that we're doing together right now.  And so getting perspective on when a couple hundred people show up or not.  You're digging it, though?  Yeah, it's awesome, man.  Yeah.  And we're still, we have the attitude of, we play a lot of music together all the time. 
[01:45:00]  We have for years, you know.  So if there's four people or 4,000 or 400, we're still hitting it the same.  We're still going out there and crushing it.  What are you guys all, old friends there, Jason?  We've been playing together since 95 or so.  Brian and I met in 95.  It's always been like a 16 years old.  It was a side thing back then when you were doing it?  Yeah, it's always been a thing that we tried to do.  You know, if we had two days a week or two days a year, depending on how busy Metallica was,  or these guys had other projects on, they were in high school when I met him.  Wait, you were in high school and then you meet Jason? 
[01:45:30]  What the hell was that like for you?  Oh, wait, that mic's not on.  Help him out with this one.  Yeah, turn that one on.  Yeah, you guys share that mic.  Dude, what the hell was that like, though?  It was pretty cool.  I mean, like, the Super Bowl was on, so that was like sports or something.  Yeah, we were watching, the Niners were running, you know, 95 Super Bowl,  right, so we were watching at my friend's house.  Yeah.  And my old drum kit's over there, like the second-handed one that we had in the studio in the old days,  but it's in the kid's room where it's like next to all the, and they're, uh... 
[01:46:00]  That's okay, you left the T out.  Yeah, and there's, uh, you know, Kool-Aid spilling and boogers smeared on it.  Kids hit it with dolls and stuff, you know what I mean?  Bringing spatulas and play, you know?  And I heard this, you know, like funky, cool drumming coming up.  I didn't know anybody was in the building that had anything going on like that.  Well, little kid's playing that stuff, right?  Oh, man.  So I go running in there, and there's Brian.  He's 16, and the sticks are looking pretty big in his hand, you know,  but he's still nailing this Tower of Power kind of feel, you know? 
[01:46:30]  And so...  Dude, so key.  So key hopping on the kid at that moment.  Right, and he's a jazz kid, you know, but still, he knew about Metallica.  Yeah, but when the Chop House, my studio, it's like six houses from where we met,  and so I called him down.  We, at halftime, we didn't even watch the second half of the game.  We just went and started jamming, and it was me and John Marshall,  the guy that usually took James' place, like when he torched himself or broke himself or whatever.  So it was these two 30-year-old metal guys blasting these riffs at this kid, 
[01:47:00]  and he's just bouncing off whatever because the improv thing that he's learned is a jazz cat.  How quick did you get on the phone with your friends and just go,  Dude, dude, guess who I jammed with?  He told me the next day.  I didn't believe it.  Really?  Dude, I swear.  Yeah, keep cranking it in your sleep.  Yeah.  Get out of here.  Wow, that is so cool.  Well, Jason, we've got to ask the question because everyone is calling up with it.  So why did you leave Metallica?  I mean, I remember hearing back when it all went down that you said you were tired of touring, right? 
[01:47:30]  It was wearing you out.  Nothing to ever have been tired of touring.  It does have something to do with physicality.  I mean, the full-on windmill headbanging thing since flotsam years,  so that makes 20 years of that full-on thing.  You know, you only got so much cartilage and bone and so forth in any man,  and after a while it starts getting a little thin.  But at that particular time, January of 2001, it would have been,  I wasn't feeling that strong about things, you know, 
[01:48:00]  and I wanted to take a little bit of time off, and that's when I said to those guys,  we had this meeting together.  You know, everybody had their holidays and all that,  and so finally we hooked back up at the beginning of January.  I'm going, we should take a year off, bros.  Like, you've got a baby, a new baby, you know, six months old,  and you've got one that's two, and just hang, and let's take a year off.  You guys work on your families, and I'm going to work on this music with Echo Brains  that I've been trying to, like, cultivate for some years with these cats,  and everybody's, um, no.  And so I said, well, I can't, you know, I'm going to have to step away then  because I have some other things that I want to work on, 
[01:48:30]  and if you guys aren't going to be able to allow me that time.  That's a ballsy move.  Yeah, it came down to just, and mostly them not realizing what keeps me alive.  You know, like, they have their families, and they have whatever interests that they do.  They do that. I have music, and that's what I continue chasing.  You know, ten, minimum of ten projects a year for the past ten years.  You know, Cats from Machine Head, Sepultura, and whatever,  all the Bay Area thrash bands, all that.  Always jamming with those guys in my downtime,  besides having projects like this with Dylan and Brian. 
[01:49:00]  So they knew that about me, man. They always did.  So when they questioned whether I was going to have the time  to dedicate myself to Metallica like I always did,  or the thing I've been doing the whole time.  Right, right.  So it was kind of weird.  But now you were kind of saying, hey, I want some time for this.  Right, but I just couldn't see how it would affect the monster of Metallica.  How would it change the fact of people coming to sit in seats  to see the live show that's always been beautifully consistent and strong,  or the records that people can sink their teeth into and can rely on over the years? 
[01:49:30]  How could this hour of beautiful music have anything to do with affecting that?  You know, I just couldn't add it up in my head.  You know what, I think anybody being in bands, you know, would be amazed  that it still translates to the huge bands like Metallica,  because that kind of stuff goes on with garage bands or bands that are playing.  You ever get the guy that just, you know,  your guitarist wants to play with another guy down the street, 
[01:50:00]  and you're like, hey, you're not taking this project seriously.  You know, you've got to, if you have any extra energy to dedicate to another project,  you should be giving that much more to this project.  Right, but when you get to the point where, say, working 14 or 15 years together,  taking this westernized rock and roll music to places that was never accepted before,  breaking down these barriers for bands like whoever they are today,  you know, System of a Down or whatever,  they can go there like it ain't no thing.  Well, back in the day, it's because we did what we did,  and before us, Black Sabbath did what they did or whatever. 
[01:50:30]  But for our genre of music, we crushed some walls down to get this music across the world.  So are there any hard feelings there, Jason?  Not at all, man.  We're totally bros.  I mean, it's always going to be that way.  We're business partners forever, and we've helped create something that is forever.  Would you go back?  It would have to be a very special circumstance.  There would have to be a lot of things that would be changed as far as the way that the money's pissed away.  Pissed away?  Pissed away.  But with fun things or bad? 
[01:51:00]  No, with just, I think, frivolous things.  Really?  There's no need to order six dinners after the show if you're only going to eat half of one.  That's one minor little thing, you know what I'm saying?  But that kind of mentality.  And since James and I are still the tightest, I think, and always have been in that band,  it would have to be him asking me, man, looking me in the eye and say,  bro, I got these 15 songs, can you come and support them, make them better for me, do what you do on, you know,  because that's the understanding we've had for years. 
[01:51:30]  He writes this cool stuff, I come in and try to make it better with the low end, you know, that's it.  We've had that kind of unspoken law between us for a long, long time, but that's how it would have to be.  It could not be an accountant through an attorney, through Joe Blow, through whoever.  Right, you've got to get the call, personally.  You know, it's got to be James.  Absolutely.  It's got to be James.  And how's he doing?  He's doing good.  It seemed like he had his problems there.  Yeah, there's, yeah, a lot of things that I think maybe people were misconstrued about,  had nothing to do with chemicals or anything like that. 
[01:52:00]  That was not, so he has, as long as I've known him, he has never touched any kind of powder or any kind of that crap.  Yeah.  This was not his deal at all.  And it was more mental things, and the state that he was in and the time that he came down on my head about everything,  I just didn't realize how troubled he was at the time, you know.  A lot of pressure on him and stuff.  A lot of pressure on things, and I was always the one that pretty much he lashed out at.  Did he have a little breakdown or something?  I think it was the kind of thing of, there's so much going on in his head with his family and all that, 
[01:52:30]  and there was always two dressing rooms in Metallica.  There was Lars and Kirk's and James and Jason's, right?  So we always had a special thing when it's just us for a certain time,  talking about different things and personal things that usually, you know,  like you were talking about before, the quality time or the regular time,  any kind of normalcy within your life.  Right.  As the band gets bigger and bigger, even though you don't want to go play with your buddy down the street or whatever,  but when the band gets huge like that, there's so much demand on your time, 
[01:53:00]  you don't have really time for real things.  Right, your whole life turns into Metallica.  Yeah, and you have to always be on call for it.  So that's going to mess up anybody, no matter how stable you are.  Hell yeah.  Yeah, in time, I guess that'll take its toll on anybody.  Pretty much, but I really got to say, people, it's important for people to know that it is on the up and up,  and they're jamming again, and I've heard a couple of riffs,  and it's, people should know better than to ever doubt Metallica.  Do you get a little piece of it, though, that goes like, I would have done this?  Do you think that?  I feel really good about what's happening now with Echo Brain and some other music that I'm working on, 
[01:53:30]  and a certain incredible freedom that I've never felt before.  Yeah.  A control that I've never felt before, and that's pretty great.  But Metallica, you know, I've spent more than half of my adult life chasing that and working on that  and living that, right, and believing in it so truly.  And so now, it's always going to be a piece of me.  I'm completely proud of it.  People come up after the show when we're signing stuff. 
[01:54:00]  We always, of course, sign after the show and talk to people and things.  And somebody, they kind of hesitantly put the Injustice for All album out in front of you.  Like you're going to be pissed or something, right?  You're going to be cool to sign this, you know?  And I'm like, are you kidding, man?  You're proud of it, man.  So nobody can ever change that.  Nobody can take away the way that we took the music to the people  and the experiences that we had with millions of human beings across this world.  A lot of places learn their English language from our songs.  They wouldn't know how to say, order me a cheese sandwich in English, 
[01:54:30]  but they know every word to every song from Metallica.  And any of that dialogue that you want to know or the vocabulary,  their English vocabulary are the words of Metallica.  Hey, Jason, before we move on, I've got to ask one more question.  Did Lars take it too far with the Napster thing?  Because it seemed like it pissed off a lot of the Metallica fans.  Yeah, it's just a weird thing.  I think it never got put across quite right because of the way it was all sensationalized and weird things.  Metallica has a unique record contract, different than anyone else in the business, 
[01:55:00]  different than Michael Jackson, different than Madonna.  You pick whoever the top notch is.  Ours is still better.  Okay?  Since 1990, Metallica has funded everything we've done ourselves,  with no help from a bank or a record company or whatever like that.  Four guys, right?  And so when someone does something like steal our music,  then they're taking directly from us.  We own our own music.  We were not going out to save the world or to represent all the artists or be the good guys or all that. 
[01:55:30]  We had the means to protect ourselves and our unique contract and our music.  We went forth with that.  If there was any way that anybody could have predicted that because Lars was standing up for us  as our spokesman, Metallica's spokesman, not the world of music, Metallica's spokesman,  that he would become the face of the enemy, we would have never put him in that position.  But he was always the guy that talked good and represented us in that way. 
[01:56:00]  So people need to understand that music is meant to be shared but not stolen.  You have to understand that if your father's a dentist, a doctor, a bricklayer, a truck driver, whatever,  I really doubt that he's going to go to work week after week after week continuing to do what he does  and not get a paycheck ever or all of a sudden get one twelfth of what he's used to getting  even though he's working twice as hard, it just doesn't make any sense in that way. 
[01:56:30]  Were you guys and Lars satisfied with what happened with Napscott?  I think it was just, man, if you just harness it right, it can be cool for everybody.  That's the problem.  You just need to be able to work.  It got too far ahead of itself, the cart before the horse, man.  And it needed to be, you know, it needs to be worked out that everybody can work from it.  Bands still want to make music and still can earn their living playing their music.  People that are gifted and are meant to play music for other people, they should be able to live from that. 
[01:57:00]  It's kind of the nature of the Internet, though.  There's a lot of stuff going on.  I mean, movies, major motion pictures that are bootleg.  And it just seems like everything they put in place to try to keep that from happening,  there's some other person that can crack it.  And if you want anything, audio, video, anything, you can get it on the Internet, somehow, someway.  And that's all good and everything, but is it the quality?  Right.  And the tangible, I mean, holding, you know, when you bought Zeppelin II, I mean, holding it in your hands. 
[01:57:30]  That, it's your copy, it's yours, nobody else's, man.  That's what we always argued.  When you want to play it, and that whole thing, the way that the artist meant for you to translate it, to accept it, to realize it.  Right.  So much work goes into that to present it.  The other argument was that there was never enough given to the consumer in that package, besides the music. 
[01:58:00]  You know, some more.  I know that, well, that was the argument that a lot of people would say.  You can download the music, and you're pretty much getting what you can get at the record store.  But, you know, that stepped people up to do some interactive things with the CD-ROMs, and getting some stuff that you can get on the computer, getting a little more clever with the lyric sheets in there, and the cover art, and things like that, you know.  And I think that was something good that came out of it.  It just can't change, you know, no matter how.  I mean, this is going to always be, you know, the Internet thing, and people spreading it, and sharing it, and that kind of thing. 
[01:58:30]  It's always going to be like that.  But nothing can take the place of having your own copy, or standing in front of the band and tasting the volume, you know, and that whole thing.  And a lot of times, I don't know if this discourages people, when they just get so used to getting everything for free, and instead of going to experience the music for real, for live, the human factor.  I mean, nothing can take that place.  And so, you can be all, like, pale, and atrophied, and all that crap in front of your computer screen, and downlight all the crap you want, but you're not alive, dude, to me. 
[01:59:00]  Hey, Jason, someone is screaming through the phones here.  Let's talk to him.  All right, I'll let him just ask the question, say it himself.  Brian, what's up?  Yeah, how's it going, guys?  Good, what's up, man?  Great, thanks for having me.  Listen, I'm a huge fan of Metallica.  I love you guys.  Good.  I do have to say, though, to be honest with you, you're being a little bit of a hypocrite.  Now, if you remember, before you were even a part of Metallica, when they first got started, how did Metallica get well-known? 
[01:59:30]  By playing live music and taking the music to the people.  Exactly.  However, if you remember, they used to encourage people to hand out their bootleg tapes or whatever it was back then, and they encouraged that.  Now, all of a sudden, they're changing their tune.  I have to say, I'm a little disappointed about that.  I think that you should probably get your hat on straight, because think about what it takes to trade one physical tape into an envelope with a customs form and a stamp and send it to someone, 
[02:00:00]  as opposed to pushing a button in your living room, in your freaking slippers, and sending it out to a million people.  Technology's got to change.  That's a little bit different, pal.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  Just a minute, man.  And there's a lot of effort that goes into true tape trading.  There is a vibe to it.  We allow people to tape our shows every night.  We do not discourage any kind of sharing of music. 
[02:00:30]  All we discourage is people stealing music.  That is just wrong.  And I'm not being hypocritical in the way.  I still tape trade.  The first 2,000 advanced CDs of the Echo Brain album, I put in envelopes myself with my own hands and wrote the addresses on it myself.  I still stick to that the way that Flotsam did it back in the day.  And I'm not saying that the Internet is wrong and all that kind of thing, but stealing is wrong no matter how you slice it. 
[02:01:00]  You bring up a great point.  If I was to give my CD to a good friend of mine and say, here, I got the new Metallica CD.  Why don't you copy that?  It's the same exact thing in open-air that you guys even made that point a while back.  It's just like trading amongst friends.  I think he brings up a good point, though, with the fact that technology has changed.  You're still thinking about trading tapes with a mindset from the early 90s, you know, where it was a different story.  Early 80s was what I'm thinking of.  Yeah, early 80s, right.  And Jason brings up a great point that technology has changed in that, you know, now with a push of a button, you could send this off to thousands of people. 
[02:01:30]  A million.  I would like, I mean, every night when we talk to people at the show, I say, tell your friends about this music and share this music with your friends.  I have no problem with you handing it from your hand to your friend's hand.  Let me ask you one more question.  But handing it to a million people across the world with one button and no personal connection, that blows.  Hold on.  Let me just add this, okay?  Obviously, Metallica doesn't need the help in that way, but, like, you got the new band Echo Brain and you got a nice buzz on the band and stuff. 
[02:02:00]  So wouldn't you be quite psyched if they were trading like crazy over the Internet to get the name out there for the band?  I don't have any problem with that.  And having people listen to it?  Because obviously you're not getting a lot of radio play right now.  Right.  So this would be another way where you could get the name of the band out there and show everyone what you're up to these days.  Exactly.  By having people just hit that button and send it to a million possible consumers.  That's true.  And we do that in our own way.  And we were speaking of the way that we harness it through our website. 
[02:02:30]  God, he has an answer for everything.  I love it.  Offering music to people at a very reasonable price so they can have their own thing.  They can check out our music and download a song here and download a song there to check out that whole thing.  Right.  But still, the fact of trying to get just the same thing you're talking about, trying to get a band off the ground.  You can't get a band off the ground if you don't get any money from selling your CDs.  If everybody's just taking it for free, then how could you ever get a band established or on the road or anything like that? 
[02:03:00]  So there is a middle point that you have to meet.  You know, harness it in your way.  Present it to the people that you want to, whether it is in the medium of computers, the medium of video, and the medium of the LP, or in the medium of taking the music to the people live.  Those are the four elements that you have to choose from.  And so if you can harness them, as long as they come out of our heart, hands, and heads the way that we want them coming away from us, there's nothing we're going to be able to do about where it goes from there. 
[02:03:30]  Of course, we encourage people to share the music, but not freaking steal it.  Now, about the music, people are going to be listening.  It's different than Metallica, that's for sure.  Other people are going to be surprised.  It really is.  We're listening earlier.  Can I read a review?  Yeah, let's do it, man.  All right, early review from the beginning of the tour that ran in the San Jose Mercury News.  This is Echo Brain.  This was a first appearance that would rank with those of Nirvana, Green Day, and Smashing Pumpkins. 
[02:04:00]  It was straight-ahead rock, deep and rich, with layers you wanted to hold up and examine and listen to over and over.  It was like nothing else out there.  It just sounded right.  That's a great review for your live show.  There you go.  That was our first live show.  And then reviews on the album.  I mean, he's taking this very serious, Ant.  This isn't just a little side thing.  Playboy.  Echo Brain's debut is an...  I hate when they over-explain crap where you get confused.  Echo Brain's debut is an intricate, often gorgeous tapestry of melodic rock. 
[02:04:30]  With a sound this fresh, it's easy to understand Newstead's decision,  and hard to believe that Echo Brain hasn't been around forever.  Hmm.  That's pretty cool.  You've just had this type of music in you, and you haven't really been able to have an outlet for it.  We've been playing music together for six years.  Dylan Duncan is the main songwriter in Echo Brain.  Brian and Dylan have an incredible bond.  They've been playing music together since they were 11. 
[02:05:00]  On real instruments.  I mean, real drum kit.  Right, right.  Real guitars.  They come from musical families.  That whole thing.  It's instilled, man.  It is there.  They are on the same playing field, you know, as far as musicianship and all that.  I have a hard time catching up with them sometimes, as far as that stuff goes.  Songwriting skills and stuff like that, they definitely are very gifted in that way, right?  So, it's just something that had to be, it was just a matter of time before we decided to present it to people. 
[02:05:30]  We knew it was going to happen at some point, but this thing was never contrived in the way like, we're going to get a band, we're going to make a demo, we're going to be famous.  Right, because everyone thinks it's like Jason Newstead's band, and here's what he does, and then they're supporting players.  Because, you know, it's different than these guys are writing the songs, right?  It's a team.  It's just like a bunch of old friends hanging out, you know, jamming in the whole porch, you know?  It's neighborhood drunken porch jam, dude.  Nice.  That became...  Good night and chicken legs.  That is true, man.  And it became something where we just always made sure to have a boombox around or whatever and record everything. 
[02:06:00]  Right.  And then, like, at the end of 99, we started getting serious about it, putting some demos together, arranging some songs, started calling ourselves Echo Brain at the beginning of 2000.  We went to record this in May and June of 2000.  It's almost two years old, this record already, and I could have told you it was recorded last week, and you still believe me.  It has a refreshing, alive, organic thing because of the way it was developed.  It wasn't forced together like this thing.  It just happened.  So it is a real band now, and we all have other projects away from Echo Brain now. 
[02:06:30]  Uh-oh.  So that's how that goes.  Don't confuse it too much, Jason.  Hey, Brother Joe, what's up?  Yo.  What's up, man?  Yo.  Have I been on?  You are on.  You're on right now.  You're so on, man.  I was just...  I mean, this is totally self-serving, but Jason, has Metallica found a touring bass player yet?  Look at Joe trying to get the gig.  I don't think they've found any kind of bass player.  You whore.  I just want to... 
[02:07:00]  This is Anthony's brother, and he...  This is my brother.  And not that you're going to be in total war when it comes to something like a possible...  Not that you care what this guy could...  He could make it happen, man.  I'd like to just kind of get it...  Put it in perspective for you.  All right.  This is in no way in any kind of...  This is not disrespectful or anything.  This is just the facts.  Just the facts.  My main bros that still hang in Metallica that have took care of me for years tell me the stories of people sending in their resumes and their CDs and their demos and all that. 
[02:07:30]  And my boy puts them on a table at the rehearsal thing for when the guys come into the rehearsal that day.  James comes in.  He, you know, looks at this magazine, grabs himself a tea or whatever, and looks over there and goes...  And takes all of them, rolls them up, stamps on them, and throws them in the garbage can.  He's like...  It's something that you can't... 
[02:08:00]  It's something that you can't...  You can't send a tape into.  It's not...  You'd have to...  You know, you need to have some type of personal rapport with these people.  That's right.  And it's also something that not someone who is 22 or 23 years old is going to be able to get this gig.  Absolutely not.  They're not going to have somebody that's just bouncing around all over the place and has no clue.  And also to share the magnets.  You're speaking with somebody that's been playing for over 30 years at this point.  That's cool.  So I'm with you, man. 
[02:08:30]  And you understand where it's at with those guys.  The whole thing is it has to be someone from the family.  It has to be someone that has been within the circle for many, many years.  Yeah, you have people...  I mean, Metallica has people around them that are very gifted musicians.  They could probably do the job just as well as anyone else.  I wouldn't bet on that.  I mean, can you blame me for calling and asking?  I would say...  All right, Joe.  You're a whore, Joe.  It's cool, Joe, but I think that what's going to happen is Metallica will remain a recording band.  James will most likely play the bass on the recordings for the ones that are going to be coming in the next 18 months. 
[02:09:00]  If something gets really wacky and they do want to get Metallica Mark III, as we call it, when I was in the band, back together,  then to do the record or to do whatever, then that's always possible.  You never say never on anything because we have gone through too much together to ever back out on that.  But I feel that Joey Vera out of Armored Saint would probably be the right guy for the job because of his mentality, his producer skills. 
[02:09:30]  He's known the family for 25 years.  I mean, the whole thing.  It has to be that kind of person.  Sorry, Joe.  I don't think it's going to be Mike Inez.  I don't think it's going to be someone who's been in a lot of bands, like that kind of thing.  And Robert Trujillo, God bless those guys, much respect to them, but I don't think it's going to be that kind of person.  All right.  Well, good luck, Joe.  Yeah, we got rid of Joe. 
[02:10:00]  Thank God Joe doesn't step on people when he calls in.  Oh, I know, I know.  Echo Brain is playing all over the place.  You guys are playing Washington tomorrow, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's talk about Echo Brain for a while now because that's why we're here and we're psyched about it.  This is the first time that Brian and Dylan have ever been on tour, guys.  Really?  Ever, ever, ever.  So we're saying, you know, to their parents that they saw their kids for the last time when they saw them step on that tour bus, baby.  What the hell have you been doing with yourself?  Locked in a room, writing?  Yeah, a lot of reading and watching television. 
[02:10:30]  Are you showing them right, though, the right way of the road?  Taking all that experience that you had with Talika and showing them the right way?  I'm trying to be the big brother.  Yeah.  I'm not going to be the mom, a show by example, work ethic, and that kind of thing that means, you know,  you take certain things seriously as far as presenting our stuff and knowing what we're capable of.  Tell them which girls to roll two condoms on with.  Sure.  Yes.  But don't take the music too seriously. 
[02:11:00]  Have you made them do the wasabi shot or what?  They already knew about wasabi.  I couldn't get that over on them, man.  That sucks.  But the whole thing about, you know, they have to meet them halfway.  They're still going to be comfortable on the nice tour bus and all that kind of thing,  but they are also going to taste some crap and also experience some of the things.  Like, we're pushing pretty hard in some of these days right now,  and they're starting to feel it and see what it takes to be out here and really do it.  But you're doing what you're doing.  The fringe benefits are considerably groovy. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  One of the cool things about the Echo Brain show now,  like a Metallica show, you know, the first 20 rows is all dudes in, you know,  black Metallica shirts.  It's like, it's the master of Bubba.  And then at Echo Brain, it's like the first three or four rows is chicks.  Nice.  There you go.  From there.  And it has, you know, Dylan sings nice and it works all good.  It's nice.  So we're going towards that kind of vibe, and that works for everybody.  The crowd has become a bit more diverse, and that's really what we're after.  All right.  I'd say we check out some Echo Brain.  Let the music do the talking. 
[02:12:00]  And we want to thank these guys for stopping by, too, man.  Guys, thank you so much, man.  We're going to talk about, what do we got?  Can we talk about some shows here for one second?  Hell yeah.  Just real quickly.  Yeah, tomorrow night you're in Washington, D.C. at the 930 Club, right?  That's right.  And Friday in Philly.  These are all the cities we're in, man.  Theater of the Living Arts, TLA, of course.  Tuesday, May 21st, New York at the Bowery Ballroom.  Nice.  And don't forget about Saturday, May 18th, Old Bridge at Birch Hill.  That's going to be a huge, cool, cool show.  And we have an excellent band opening for us out of Portland, Oregon. 
[02:12:30]  They're called the Helio Sequence.  And it's a guitar player, a drummer, and a laptop computer blasting out of these bass speakers.  And it's just a beautiful, so unique, ethereal, kick-ass thing, man.  And so the two and a half or three hours of entertainment that we've got together at this show, I feel very proud about.  And it's not something that you will have witnessed before.  Cool, man.  I mean, it's different every night for Echo Brain, the way that we take the songs, where we go with stuff and that. 
[02:13:00]  And anybody that has any doubts about the heaviness factor of Echo Brain that maybe doesn't translate as much as they'd like to on the record,  I am, as a friend, I am inviting them to come down and check out Echo Brain and the way that it goes.  Because it is powerful, man.  It is serious business.  It's a live show.  Serious business.  Well, let's check out Keep Me Alive.  Yes.  It's Echo Brain.  I want to thank Jason and Dylan and Brian for stopping by. 
[02:13:30]  It's Dylan on vocals here.  Check it out.  Echo Brain.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  That's all right.  Jason wanted to say one other thing before he takes off, Anthony.  First of all, I want to say thank you guys very much for having the calls to help us out with Echo Brain.  That's very cool.  So we got Echo Brain coming at you live Thursday, May 16th, Washington, D.C. at the 930 Club.  Friday, May 17th, Philadelphia at the Theater of Living Arts. 
[02:14:00]  Tuesday, May 21st, New York, New York at the Bowery Ballroom.  Saturday, May 26th, New Orleans at the Howlin' Wolf.  And Thursday, May 30th, Dallas, Texas at Trees.  Dallas.  And Echo Brain performs as a five-piece.  We got two guys out of New York City.  Chris Sciani on lead guitar and David Borla on percussion and keyboards.  So there you go.  Check out echobrain.com or chophouserecords.com for all the information, tour dates, and fun stuff you need to know about the band. 
[02:14:30]  And one more time, team, time, time.  God bless you guys.  Thanks a lot for the help.  Thanks, guys.  Best of luck to you, man.  Echo Brain!  Come back and see us soon, all right?  It's Echo Brain.  Guys, have fun, man.  Jason Newstead's new band with Dylan on vocals and Brian doing the drums.  Thanks a lot, guys.  No problem.  Y'all rule, man.  For sure.  No problem.  Don't try to leave with the headphones. 
[02:15:00]  I might.  People have done that.  Get up and walk out and go, looks like you've just been roped.  All right.  We'll see you guys again.  There they go.  Echo Brain.  Echo Brain.  Thank you.  See you when I see you.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  You are the worst, Jim.  I'll have it out there.  Don't get Jason Newstead with the wait, wait, wait game.  He got him, though.  He even set it up for me. 
[02:15:30]  He goes, dude, dude, look, dude, dude.  I'm going to do it, dude.  There are people asking.  People are asking for tickets.  If you want to go see Echo Brain, stay on the line, and we'll give you tickets for the  shows we got, okay?  I think we got some tickets to see Echo Brain at the Bowery Ballroom next Tuesday, May 21st.  Tickets available through TicketWeb.com.  Well, we got a couple pairs if you're on hold right now, right?  Man, what a day.  Yeah.  Can we start the show?  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday, everyone.  Yeah, great.  Whip'em Out Wednesday. 
[02:16:00]  We didn't even get to any of that today.  No, and there were a lot of people calling in saying they were seeing some stuff on the  highways today.  But we were so preoccupied with that goof, that ass munch.  Eddie.  Oh, Eddie.  Eddie.  Eddie.  That's just a joke.  Relax, Jim.  Yeah, if you're just tuning in, it's starting to look like Eddie the murderer is starting 
[02:16:30]  to look.  Can we just say this?  He's a kook.  That's it.  Yeah.  Like, enough already.  Hey, man.  Anything's possible.  I mean, we're pretty convinced that the guy's just out of his brain.  As New York One is now reporting it, Opie, as a hoax.  But I sure hope they don't report it like we did a hoax.  The funny thing is, the Fox News crew, when they left, they cornered Ken Stevens, Super  GM Ken Stevens in the hallway.  Oh, really?  They put the camera on him with the lights bright in his eyes and was trying to have 
[02:17:00]  him confess that we were up to this thing.  That it was a hoax?  And that we did it.  Did Ken crack, even though it wasn't?  Yes, it was.  Ken told them, and I hope they run it on the news.  I don't even know who's going to run what anymore.  Oh, I know.  But Ken goes, if it was a hoax by those two guys, you'll be interviewing another murderer.  Oh, you mean him, because he'd be so angry that he'd be... 
[02:17:30]  Okay, okay.  Killer will be dead, and he'd be...  There'll be another murderer.  Oh, Ken Stevens.  Because there will be two more dead bodies.  He probably over-explained it, because I'll kill them.  Because I'll kill them, like, you know, the guy said.  Yeah, like, I'll be the Eddie, but not really.  Eddie?  Awful.  Oh, here's what a New York one is now reporting.  Radio talk show murder confessed deemed a hoax.  Police said Wednesday that the story of a man who confessed to a murder on the Opie and Anthony radio show yesterday 
[02:18:00]  is a hoax, and the case is no longer being investigated.  They're not even going to look into the, like, see if he possibly did do this,  even if he was just some kook talking.  It's over.  But he's still a kook.  The NYPD originally said it was taking the matter seriously,  but after an investigation, the story was deemed a hoax.  That's it.  It's over, Johnny.  It was our little day in the sun.  It was a fun day, though, man. 
[02:18:30]  It was a fun day.  Did we get any inside word on what some of the things that they learned about Eddie?  Because I'm hearing things.  Keep the cop in the studio?  How are you?  Hey, how you doing?  Since it's no longer an open investigation.  You know, when you show up to a guy's house and he's standing there with nothing on but a Giants jersey,  no underwear.  Giants?  He was supposed to have a wow T-shirt on, that bastard.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[02:19:00]  Is this fact?  From a reliable source.  Yeah.  From a reliable source.  So the detectives show up and he just has a Giants jersey, no underwear on.  And he's just standing there.  Yeah.  Was it Tom from New Orleans?  How you guys doing?  About time you got hurt.  Come on in.  Well, I called up and said I was a murderer.  How do you like my accent?  It was nice, man.  So he answers the door like that.  And then I guess the detectives go in and is there any...  No, I'm saying is there. 
[02:19:30]  I know.  What did the place look like?  Get this.  From an unconfirmed source, it's just, we probably should do a Cribs death.  It's basically what it comes down to.  Really?  We should send somebody over with.  They're just going to let this guy be?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  He's giving me the sign.  I can't say anymore.  Did they say how big a boy Eddie is?  Yeah, was he packing Keith?  No, no.  Wait, is it true that it was like a shrine to the O&A show? 
[02:20:00]  Very similar to what this studio looks like today.  Because I'm here and there's wow stickers plastered all over like the walls and the phone number of this station written everywhere on the walls.  In blood.  Like he's just completely mad.  Why don't we set up a Cribs?  Columbia in blood.  See if the guy would be up for letting us get a camera in there.  Crazy Eddie the murderer, not murderer Cribs. 
[02:20:30]  That's not a bad idea.  Eddie Cribs.  I want to run with that.  My wife lives with me three days a week.  Shut it.  Does not.  That really annoyed me.  I also heard from unconfirmed sources that he's 13 years unemployed.  He called that retired.  You know, you want to think.  And he's taking all kinds of mind-altering psychiatric medications.  I'd like to cussle his hair with a bat.  Do you think he's really married then? 
[02:21:00]  Probably not.  Probably divorced.  Unconfirmed sources say.  Formerly married.  Formerly married.  Does he really have a kid though?  No.  Uh, yeah.  Proud of her dad being naked in a Giants jersey.  Yeah.  That's my pop.  In front of the police in a shrine to, uh, this radio station.  Nothing is wrong with being new, but when you hear the bell, don't you put on a pair  of boxers, you jackass?  Put a little something on.  Unless you got a long, you know, spanky going to bed kind of nightgown.  I don't know. 
[02:21:30]  A night before Christmas nightgown.  Put the little nightgown and the hat.  How you guys doing?  He comes through the door with a single candle and that little thing you hold a single candle  in.  A little shadow.  Liquoring flame.  That's so funny.  What the hell is up with those PJs?  So they have no doubt in their minds that he's a kook.  He is a kook.  Yeah.  And they say this is an absolute, 100%, this guy just is a nut. 
[02:22:00]  And, see, I wouldn't deem that a hoax.  A hoax seems like he, he, like, planned to say this for, uh, the radio.  It sounds like he's just a kook that, like, comes out with this stuff.  Makes up these little stories.  Tall tales.  He's a nut.  Tall, telling tall tales.  All right.  Well, Joe wants it.  Timmy, tail teller.  Hey, Joe, what's up?  Don't I know.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I hear from an unconfirmed source that, uh, Kent Stevens just ordered 100 pies for the 
[02:22:30]  commissioner to throw at you.  Just to make everything okay.  Right.  All right, guys.  Later, guys.  All right.  I hear we have to go down to the, uh, Children's Cancer Hospital and take some pictures of us  giving them the pies.  Don't even start with that.  Just keep it above the waist so they don't see the rod.  Hey, where's Ron and Fez today?  Yeah.  They don't want to look ridiculous?  With us?  Come on.  Look ridiculous.  Come on in and look ridiculous with us. 
[02:23:00]  Where are they?  Are they here?  They've got to be here.  Oh, they're avoiding us like the plague.  Where's Fez?  You know why?  When it was, uh, when everyone assumed that this guy might have, uh, murdered these people,  it was like this was a police station and ONA got the collar.  That's right.  Even though Ron and Fez had the perp and kind of introduced us to the perp, we got the  collar.  I do.  And it seemed a little unfair.  I do believe it's all Ron and Fez's fault.  It is.  I blame them.  Actually, somehow they'll be able to blame their producer, Al Dukes, for it. 
[02:23:30]  Didn't he hang up on a guy or something?  Yes.  Which, see, maybe he had a little more sense than, uh, everyone else.  Yeah, why get press for the show?  No, he doesn't.  Let's go to Johnny.  Johnny, what's up?  Hey, how you guys making it up tonight?  Ah, pretty good.  What's going on?  Not much.  You know, I was just thinking about this whole thing here.  And probably what got everybody screwed up was, like, I could think back to, like, one whole  execution that we had witnessed on TV, even. 
[02:24:00]  This could be the worst thing I've ever heard.  What are you talking about?  Johnny, did you kill anybody?  I've never killed nobody.  You sound like a nut.  Yeah, what are you talking about?  All right, look, when I was in high school, okay, they made the, you've seen a Challenger  explosion, right?  Yes, it was funny, so what?  It was funny.  Yeah, right, but, you know, as a high school student, they made us watch this thing over  and over and over and over again.  You know what I mean?  Nobody in this generation should be right. 
[02:24:30]  I mean, come on.  Get your, uh, what did we learn's ready for the, uh, program today, the end of the program.  Oh, he's still on?  Sorry.  I didn't know I was talking.  Yeah, I mean, come on.  We watched the government kill.  Where's my brother Joe on the phone now to talk over this guy?  Talks over Jason Newstead.  We watched the government kill seven people.  Come on.  It's like, boom.  All right, well, um, well, we don't know what happened here.  Let's watch it again.  You know?  Come on.  Of course we're not going to be that right in the head. 
[02:25:00]  Come on.  They made us watch this thing over and over again, and they put it on video.  We watched it over, and there you go.  Boom.  Here you go.  It was a shuttle.  There's a teacher.  Hey.  I'm telling you, everybody in my high school was like, yeah, they just killed the teacher.  Yeah.  We're like, oh.  The teachers are like, well, that wasn't supposed to happen.  Obviously not.  They're supposed to go into space, but they blew up before they got there.  I find that whole thing amusing. 
[02:25:30]  But, you know, it's still not right because of it.  You really are a yammering ninny, sir.  Yeah, you know.  Well, you know.  You're useless.  You've got nothing.  You've got nothing.  Hey.  You still got.  Nothing.  Thank you.  You still got.  Thank you, Johnny.  Useless.  Thank you, stupid.  You sfachim.  Yeah.  Hey.  What's wrong with you? 
[02:26:00]  Get off my phone.  You ignoramus.  It burns in my head.  Thank you, Johnny.  I'm just going to get rid of Johnny.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Nothing too soon.  Hey, I was wondering if Eddie won the tool tickets.  Oh, remember that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, what a mess.  What a mess.  What a mess.  What a mess.  Thank you.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, what's going on? 
[02:26:30]  Hey, how's it going?  All right, Chris.  Yeah, this is America's Most Wanted calling back saying thank you for our jobs back.  All right.  You can have that job, man.  Hey, but I want to switch the topic and talk about something that everybody wants to hear today.  Yeah.  It's, uh.  Oh, I thought he was going to hang up on us.  There he goes.  He did.  All right.  You know what, though?  I was on to him before he did it.  His timing stunk.  His timing stunk.  After someone goes, what?  You'll click.  Click right away.  You don't go, uh.  You don't go.  Let me hang up the.  Let me.  Where's the.  The Cradle for this fall?  You don't go dot, dot, dot. 
[02:27:00]  You just hang up.  Hang up.  JJ checking in.  He says, unconfirmed sources say Rock Hole called up NEW asking to have Opie's chair measured  for his ass in case we get fired over this Eddie thing.  Eddie.  Eddie, my new co-host.  My goodness.  What a cluster F this show turned out to be today.  With all the various news organizations.  Now, CBS, the woman from CBS, the lovely girl that came in, said that the store was running 
[02:27:30]  at 530.  Did it?  I don't know, but we were running tape since 5 o'clock.  Oh, really?  I think if it ran, somebody might have.  Somebody would have called us and said that.  Called in.  I do believe we've been shot in the foot by this whole thing.  Did it run?  No.  No, it didn't run.  Do you think it's going to run on Channel 9?  How about Fox? 
[02:28:00]  Will the post be printing that article tomorrow?  The post is going to have our two pictures and dopes written right under it.  Dopes.  Now, they'll have to do something.  They need the follow-up.  Well.  Because they committed.  Following up on yesterday's story about a confession.  It'll be on page 84 of the post tomorrow.  Turned out to be a hoax.  Taken by this hoax were dopey ass munches Opie and Anthony. 
[02:28:30]  Here's their pictures.  You don't think that Dan Deardor from Channel 9 will be running that story?  That's Bob O'Brien.  Bob O'Brien.  Did he get his WOW shirt?  Yeah.  I like how he said it was for a nephew.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, he's a big fan.  His son?  Sean.  You know, he's a big fan of WOW.  Let's go to Michael.  Michael, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  I just want to say to Eddie, because I know he's listening.  Thanks for nothing! 
[02:29:00]  Hey, and the second part of that story is...  Oh, boy, yeah.  That was a really bad...  He was hanging up as he was saying.  And the second part of that...  And the second part of that...  Awful.  And the second...  You ready for the second part of that story?  Hey, Dave, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, today I learned that a wacko can steal four hours of my life.  I'm punching out to listen to myself on the radio.  I think it was still some good things.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fun stuff the last two days. 
[02:29:30]  It was a lot of fun to listen to him babble like that.  And go on about his murders.  That apparently never happened.  You know, what a great way to get off the hook for murdering two people, though.  You do it.  Then years later, you confess to it.  And come off so kooky that people go,  Eh!  You're just a nut.  And they don't look for it.  As opposed to just never mentioning it and no one thinking of it.  You're right.  Why not throw attention to yourselves and then divert it?  Just in case maybe he thought people were on to him.  Eddie's an ass. 
[02:30:00]  Maybe he heard a few things.  Hi, Fez.  Fez!  Hey!  All I can say is thank God we have a producer like Al Deuce who keeps these crackpots off our show.  Ronnie, Ronnie, what happened to your boy Eddie there?  I know we got a guy tonight who says he's found the Lindbergh baby.  Oh, is that it?  Between 7 to 11.  You get enough WOW stickers up in here today?  You know, I am disgusted by this program. 
[02:30:30]  Every time a news organization wants to drop in, we want it to look so spontaneous.  There are, it has to be 100, 150 WOW stickers plastered all over the studio laying on the console.  There's huge WOW banners.  There's one on Anthony's forehead.  Everywhere.  It looks like Eddie's bedroom.  Eddie's bedroom, right.  I hear it's a shrine.  All right, the real joke there, you know that that was Fez doing Eddie's voice yesterday.  It was.  Do it now.  Yeah.  I care to you guys in 77. 
[02:31:00]  Right after the first son of Sam murders.  Well, you did it.  You broke a story about a man on Zoloft.  Way to go.  You did it.  You pulled it off.  We're breaking ground here.  We're like Geraldo.  Yeah.  Opening up that goddamn vault.  Right?  We opened up the vault that was Eddie the murderer, and we find a guy there with a pill in his hand and a glass of water.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Here's the odd thing.  Eddie White guy. 
[02:31:30]  Who would have known?  Yeah.  We're used to the other calls.  Yeah.  You know, yesterday, Ron and Fez really wanted to be us, and today we're so happy to be themselves.  You guys effed up.  What can I tell you?  You guys are pathetic.  That'll be tomorrow's headlines in the post.  Can we send Ron and Fez's picture to the post real quick?  Hey, Frankie, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  They ran it at 6 o'clock on CNN.  No, they didn't. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, man.  Listen, I swear to you.  I swear to you.  Eddie's my brother.  I swear to you.  Click.  What a tool.  Yeah.  So we were bamboozled by this Eddie Cook guy.  Sure.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  He sounded crazy.  I'm not going to say it.  No way.  No?  From the beginning, we said he might be just delusional.  Oh, I know.  But, yeah, I guess he's just a nut that likes blurting this stuff out.  But on the other hand, what would you say if the cops eventually showed up and the story's 
[02:32:30]  on TV?  Wouldn't you be saying, hey?  Hey.  Hey.  I was fooling around.  Hey.  Because like you said, nobody's ever going to find those bodies.  That's true.  He cut them all up and burnt them.  He's just one of those lonely people.  It's like Elliot Nyborg just likes talking to salespeople.  And then we had a shot of whiskey and we just sat there.  And we just let it go.  Come on.  I got a DVD player, too.  Not act like, oh, he's so hip.  He's the only one who gets Glengarry gloves. 
[02:33:00]  I'm glad you got it.  Glenn Ross references.  I hate when I do when I just get looked at.  Why?  It makes it fun.  Yeah.  You want people to enjoy with you.  They enjoy it out there.  We have detectives, Ronifest.  Detectives in our office.  First of all, looking around like that was a crime scene.  Right.  One of them goes, what's with the Mary Kate and Ashley poster?  Like, ah, it's an inside joke.  We'd have to go way back for that.  You best just concentrate on this murder.  And then they were looking for pictures. 
[02:33:30]  So we had to, like, go through a bunch of the archive pictures from appearances that have happened, events that you guys did.  Sure.  Because he seems to be your guy.  Oh, yeah.  He's your guy now.  Come on.  He's always spotted on our grassy knoll.  Your guy.  He didn't go on my desk, did he?  And find that old stage makeup I like to keep in there before the show.  So, I'm not going to make it four hours.  Yeah.  Coke joke.  That is great. 
[02:34:00]  We got that.  Yeah, so, you know, we had detectives, and then we were going through pictures.  Do you have pictures of him?  He's the guy with the big scar down his chest, I guess.  He had heart surgery.  Yeah, I don't know.  No pictures.  He and Patty have a picture together somewhere, I guess.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, because I guess that's how Patty hooked up with him.  Right.  Oh, Patty was interviewed on the news, and now the news is nothing.  Oh, no.  They're not even running with this.  Yeah.  It's a waste of videotape.  Great.  It's over.  All right.  We could have just sat here and not exposed it as a hoax. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, that's the angle.  You should have taken it.  Hey, we're not giving away, like, on the journalistic privilege.  Kept it going for a week.  And then let the news go at it a while more.  Yeah.  Right.  Sure.  I thought you guys handled it well, though.  I mean, why, when you're getting all the press in here, would you want it to go on?  You might as well just go, not to hoax.  Go home.  If a kooky guy says that he killed a couple of people, what the hell are you supposed to do?  You run with it.  And this guy said he killed people.  He's a kook.  He's still a kook. 
[02:35:00]  We'll give him that.  And I'm still not sure he didn't kill a couple of people.  I think he killed them.  If I had to bet, I got $100 that says he killed them.  We'll never know.  And I'll never eat Jell-O anymore anyway.  That's out of the question.  Just knowing that...  I didn't even know it was a meat byproduct until, like, about six months ago.  Gelatin.  Meat.  Meat fat.  All right.  Well, we've got to take a break and play What Do We Learn?  And then we've got to step aside for Ron and Fez, who are next here.  Yeah.  It's just sad seeing the staff come through and taking down all the wow posters and everything. 
[02:35:30]  Media day's over.  Ridiculous.  All the wow things that were...  Get signage up.  Ugh.  Whore.  It just says whore.  We showered in everything today, too.  You look great.  Thanks.  Go out for sushi after the show.  Make this thing work.  The collar shirt really bothers me.  I always wear collar shirts.  Looking all snazzy.  I got my Sears tough skins.  ABC.  Always be closing. 
[02:36:00]  Another.  I know.  I know.  We like the references.  Put the coffee down.  Coffee is for closers, you F.  All right.  What do we learn?  What do we learn next?  Hey, this is Jim Norton.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Can I do that again?  Because I'm illiterate.  All right.  Hey, this is Jim Norton.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show on 94 YSP.  Ugh.  Oh, man.  Al, what's going on? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  No, this is Al Bruce.  I learned two things today.  Yeah.  First off, how to start cooking.  J-E-L-L-O-R.  And the second thing was awesome guys made it onto another radio program this morning.  Thank you, Al.  Awful.  He was trying to make a little J-E-L-O joke.  Ha-ha.  Tony, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Two quickies.  Getting Norton'd.  Always funny. 
[02:37:00]  Number two, best way to get a wow shirt.  Make a double murder.  Or just say it's for your son.  Yeah.  That's true.  Yeah.  The guys rock.  Norton, you're the man.  Thank you, Angel Face.  All right.  There goes Tony.  Pete, what's going on?  Yeah, I learned not even Fox 5 problem solvers can get Norton laid.  You loser.  Oh, guys.  I got a great idea for the show.  Nope.  It ain't gonna work.  Stop.  Jay, what's going on?  Jackass.  Yo.  Hey, Jay.  I learned that a skank plus a psycho equals excellent opportunities to get on every television channel. 
[02:37:30]  Ah, he dropped something.  You and your tight perm.  Kenny, what's going on?  What's going on?  Hey.  Did I learn that you can't get arrested for bad radio?  And I also learned that Norton's meaty body will probably show up with a picture of Jason Newstead on eatabullet.com.  Oh, nice.  Thank you, sir.  Hold your fortune, too, Ant.  Yeah, we got to talk about the new game Ant's playing tomorrow, finally. 
[02:38:00]  Well.  Hey, Joe, what's up?  Hold your fortune.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  I learned that psychos make for great radio.  Yeah, we did learn that.  All right, I got to get going.  I got to go dispose of these vibes I just hacked up.  There you go.  Love you.  Huddle, huddle.  See you almost.  Do we have Eddie's laugh?  Yeah, Eddie's going to get the last laugh on everyone today.  Here's Eddie.  This is really him laughing.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right, look.  God damn it.  You guys have heard that laugh with a knife at their throat. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, right before everything goes dark and cold.  Look, something's going on here.  Listen to this again.  Play that again.  Yeah, that is not the laugh of a sane man.  Wow, Rick, you sound like him.  Poor Paul from Floral Park. 
[02:39:00]  I learned that no matter how many instant feedbacks I send in, I'm never funny.  Yeah, that's funny.  Punch out, Maverick.  Very good, Paul.  Witness Claude.  Hey, meet, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I learned that ONA are the new star-team hot show of radio.  Yeah, yeah.  Fortunately, we turned out to be the Heraldos.  Yeah, you know, it's all right.  All right.  Hey, check out 7thrailcrew.com.  Later, Dick.  What?  Real fast, Mark from Jersey. 
[02:39:30]  I learned never take a laxative and a sleeping pill in the same flight.  Right.  Jerry from Edison.  Eddie is a lot like Voss.  In his mind, he kills.  Oh, wow.  He should just end right there.  Wow, that's a good line.  That is a great one.  Bravo, Jerry from Edison.  Al Mack.  Today I learned if I'm unemployed for 15 years, I'm retired.  Yeah.  Footworks.  Gut from Huntington.  I learned that Crazy Eddie is insane.  Insane. 
[02:40:00]  Insane.  Insane.  Insane.  Insane.  Insane.  Mr. Blonde learned that Eddie will be fighting Lennox Lewis.  JJ from Worcester, Mass.  I learned that if you don't kill people while on Zoloft, at least you will think you did.  And Alex from Westchester today learned that Norton would like to tussle Eddie's hair with a bat.  Oh, tussle.  Eric from Queens said he learned that it's a 6.50 and he's still waiting for the Opie and Anthony show to start. 
[02:40:30]  Ah, come on.  Chris, what's going on?  I learned that he was nothing but a Timmy Tailteller.  And.  And what, hang up?  Yeah, I knew that was.  And I wait until.  God, they can't get that right.  Nah, it's just a silly thing.  Hey, Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, man.  I learned that all you can say about the situation is, who's to know? 
[02:41:00]  Who's to know?  All right, man.  Night, Petunia.  Very good.  Well, we're going to do a real show tomorrow.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't even read the paper today.  Except for one article.  We have so many things that we wanted to get to in the past two days.  Yeah.  That we have to get to tomorrow.  All right.  Well, we'll let Eddie have the last laugh.  There we go.  This is really him.  And we'll see you tomorrow.  You know, tomorrow on the show. 
[02:41:30]  We've got to do a I Remember You for Eddie the Murderer, because this is it for him. 
[02:42:00]  Come on.  This is it for him.  He spiked.  He, like, peaked and then went right back down again.  Put shelf life for Eddie the Murderer.  Yeah.  So we'll do a I Remember You tomorrow.
