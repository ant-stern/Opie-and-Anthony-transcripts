<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts detailing their building's malfunctioning elevators and their observations of various street characters during their commutes, including drunks, prostitutes, and squeegee men. This segued into a discussion of a news story about a man accused of groping young boys, leading to a conversation about different fetishes and their consequences.  Another news story, about a Florida man arrested for fondling blow-up dolls in a supermarket, provided further comedic fodder.  The show then reviewed the overwhelmingly negative critical response to *Pink Panther 2*, mocking the critics' harsh words and expressing their own disdain for Steve Martin's performance.  They also briefly discussed Jim Norton's successful stand-up shows and the surprising availability of video phone technology in 1964.  The Michael Phelps marijuana scandal was debated, comparing the relative harms of marijuana and alcohol use. A listener call-in segment devolved into a humorous debate about who portrays the biggest "c*nt" in cinema history, with many actresses being suggested (including Joan Crawford, Kathy Bates, Glenn Close, and Meryl Streep).  The Grammy Awards were briefly mentioned.  Further discussion centered around defining the term "C*nt" in a cinematic context, with multiple examples being offered, including Adrian Barbeau's role in *Creepshow*.  A 13-year-old caller, JC, updated them on Michael Phelps' sponsorship deals. A listener's photoshopped image of a swastika on Anthony's fireplace sparked a discussion about the offensiveness of Nazi symbols and Anthony's WWII memorabilia collection. Listeners were invited to submit photoshopped suggestions for his fireplace decor.

The broadcast continued with an audio recording of Captain Sully Sullenberger's calm demeanor during the Hudson River landing of Flight 1549.  Callers, including a retired Coast Guard pilot and an airline pilot, shared related experiences and insights.  Several "FU" line calls from listeners followed.  A viral video of an over-medicated child after a dental procedure was played and discussed with guest Sam.  Richie then called in to promote a King of Kong competition at his arcade, mentioning the attendance of Billy Mitchell and potentially Steve Wiebe.  The show continued with discussion of the *King of Kong* documentary.

The next segment heavily featured the *King of Kong* documentary, focusing on Billy Mitchell's personality quirks and demands, along with other personalities like Mirzak and Mark Alpager ("Pigger").  An anecdote about Eastside Dave and a drunken hot sauce order leading to a call from Mitchell himself was recounted.  The segment included a "Grammy Minute," a news story about a drug dealer continuing a transaction while on the phone with 911, and several tangents.  Drew Boogie and Sean Benjamin promoted Drew Boogie's new CD, "A Splat on the Wall of O&A," with multiple tracks being played, interspersed with humorous banter.  The possibility of a *King of Kong* movie was discussed.  The segment ended with banter with the studio audience and staff, including intern David.

A recurring bit followed, featuring David interviewing audience members.  This included: Paul, a construction worker with third-degree burns; Cat, an abortion nurse who had never seen snow; Noah, an oil tanker cleaner who witnessed a coworker's heart attack; Hoselius, a repeat guest from the previous week; and Stacy from Long Island, whose interview became highly confrontational.  All segments featured crude humor, offensive language, and sexually explicit conversations.

The show's final segment involved sexually suggestive exchanges with an unseen woman, discussion of a PalTalk interaction involving David and Stacey, mention of Jimmy Norton, and plugs for appearances by Drew and Jimmy Norton.  Sean Benjamin performed a song to close the broadcast.  Photoshopped images submitted by listeners, including one referencing a previously discussed controversial picture, were mentioned.  The show concluded with Sean Benjamin performing "Should I?", co-produced by Drew Boogie.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Every day. Every damn day. Whatever. Who gives a crap, right?  Yeah, that little delay before the music kicks in.  If no one else is going to care, why should I?  I think it's now just become, if something happens enough times, it just becomes commonplace.  Now I'd be upset if the music kicked right in.  You're like, why is it? Where's the delay?  They finally got me. It was stupid of me to care all these years. 
[00:00:30]  Stop with the caring.  I don't care anymore. You finally got me. You beat me down.  You've been beaten down.  I've been beaten down.  You finally signed the confession.  Ah, whatever.  That you committed war crimes.  They've been dropping water on my head for years.  I'm finally giving in.  Welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show. 877-212-ONDA.  How was it, Jimmy? Did you play the Super Mario Brothers to get up here today?  That's what I said to Kenny.  It was like a video game.  Yeah, it was.  We had to hit the down elevator to come back around another day to get down. 
[00:01:00]  I'm so stupid and tired that I get off the elevator.  I know that it goes lobby to 24.  I wait it, and I hit down again and waited for the same elevator to come.  And I'm like, what do I do?  You're an idiot.  Yeah, I am. And I realize I'm going to walk around.  I love these guys that have a job where they don't have to do anything except every once in a while.  Yeah.  And today was that day for the dope downstairs.  We all walk in, and the elevator banks are blocked.  Yeah.  So we find the guy.  Stupid us. 
[00:01:30]  We go to the freight elevator because that'll go right up to 14.  He goes, ah!  Ah!  I figured this whole thing out.  You can't do the freight elevator.  Why?  It's easy.  Who gives a crap, right?  It's not according to his plan.  He goes, no.  Jimmy pretty much said, you've got to go to the other elevator bank, go up to 24, cross over, and then go back down to your floor.  Yeah.  And like you said, it was like a video game.  That's going to be real nice when there's a crap load of people coming in the building at 8 and 9 o'clock that have to go into one elevator bank that only goes up to a certain floor, goes to the 24th, and then you've got to cross over and go back down. 
[00:02:00]  Do you just see loads of people waiting for those elevators like that?  I wonder if they'll stop doing it at a certain hour.  Maybe they're only going to do it until like 7.30 or something.  Oh, so only inconvenience us.  Okay, that's cool.  Well, of course, because we don't really exist.  We're early birds.  Yeah, if you go to work before, I'll even give it like 8.  Thank you, Tramp.  If you go to work before 8, you don't exist.  You're not part of the establishment, man. 
[00:02:30]  You're on your own, man.  The world's not set up for you, man.  Man.  Another example of that, I'm leaving my building today.  There's just some guy completely hammered just getting home from the bars.  Jesus Christ.  So you drove Danny in, too?  I could have thrown myself under the bus, but you're more fun.  There you go.  You know, you want to talk about completely different lives.  Yeah.  I'm starting my day, and I'm going to work, and this guy is ending his day. 
[00:03:00]  Ending his.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little drunk on the sidewalk.  Just hammered.  Not a bum either.  Just, you know, well-dressed, coming home from maybe some bootay.  Yeah.  One of those booty calls.  Oh, you think so?  That drunk?  He was pretty hammered.  And what, it was close to quarter to five, something like that, so.  Yeah.  I've been seeing more prostitutes.  I've been seeing a few of them as I'm driving to work these days. 
[00:03:30]  What did I tell you?  It's slowly happening.  It's kind of turning.  You'll notice a little crust building on things, the paint chipping off, you know, this nice  veneer that's been put on the city over the years since the 70s, kind of peeling back  a little bit.  You're lucky.  I'm serious, because it's going to get a lot worse.  Listen, I want to be in the suburbs so bad for the next few years, because this city  is going to change.  I was walking down Columbus Avenue yesterday, one of the roads and streets in my neighborhood,  and three or four more businesses just going bye-bye. 
[00:04:00]  Bye-bye.  And more zombies walking around, also known as the homeless.  Yeah, the zombies.  The zombies, they're just starting to multiply, and the prostitutes are starting to appear.  You're right.  Yeah, they're starting to come out, and man, those poor bitches, it is freezing cold out,  and they just got little tiny skirts on, and they're ripped up stockings.  How hot is that, though?  Come on.  Oh, please.  Those slut bags.  Always been afraid of that look. 
[00:04:30]  I pop out of the frigging Lincoln Tunnel over there, or they got Lincoln Tunnel, the  Midtown Tunnel.  They're right there?  Yeah, kind of walking down the side streets, crossing over.  Yeah, they're popping out.  Things are happening.  You're going to have to deal with the squeegee guy soon.  Me?  Catch me.  No, I don't.  Catch me.  But they could still spit on your windshield before you get a hold of the situation.  My mirror would take out his jaw at the spit.  You should have seen the chicane move I made today coming out of the tunnel and onto Third 
[00:05:00]  Avenue, because there's this weird little right-left turn you've got to make, and then  a hard right turn.  And I was cutting an apex like I was at a speedway, because I know that light turns.  If anybody's waiting there with a squeegee, they're just going to be all...  The next squeegee guy is going to have to squeegee him off my windshield.  I'll stop for that one.  Any sidewalks this morning? 
[00:05:30]  Nah, nah.  Mornings aren't really sidewalk worthy, because there's no traffic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think I saw a fan, though, yesterday.  And yesterday, I was kind of taking it easy.  It was one of those days where I was like, not in the mood to get into that.  Only 12 beers?  No, no, in the morning.  Oh, oh, oh.  It was...  I wasn't in one of those moods to really race to work.  You know?  I was like, I got time.  Let me just...  Screw it.  I'm just going to go the pace of traffic, relax a little bit.  And I think a fan of the show whips up next to me, looks at me, and then just whizzes 
[00:06:00]  past me.  I'm like, all right.  You're the guy.  Now I got to go.  So I jammed on the gas and passed him a few times.  You're the guy.  Everyone wants to race you, because you're talking a good game on the air.  Now I'm the gunslinger.  You're the gunslinger that everyone wants to take on.  The young bucks are coming into town to try to beat you.  Right.  So you can't rest ever.  Good luck.  And all you want to do is take a day off from being the gunslinger.  You can't.  One day, I just like to relax.  You can't.  That's the day you're going to get shot. 
[00:06:30]  I want to go in the right lane and just do, like, under the speed limit.  Yeah.  Wake up early, come in, and just do just under the speed limit.  Have people passing me?  I don't know what that's like.  I just don't do it.  I got a medical question.  If you have Pop-Tarts, which I'm sorry I'm eating on the air, but I'm a little behind  today, and they cook them up nice and hot.  Oh, boy.  And then put them on this styrofoam plate.  Yeah.  And now there's an imprint of the Pop-Tarts? 
[00:07:00]  Yes.  Yes.  You do have a fossilized imprint of Pop-Tarts.  Am I going to have problems in 10 years?  I don't think styrofoam is very toxic.  Great.  Who was the dummy that decided this makes sense?  You know how chemicals...  Obviously, Kenny didn't do this.  ...go in to make styrofoam?  Yeah.  There are so many.  One of which is formaldehyde, which isn't very good for you.  You stop.  Think of it on how it's made, I think.  Stop.  What are you doing?  I don't know.  No one needs that much knowledge. 
[00:07:30]  Well, you know.  You never know.  You apparently do right now.  Know if you're going to die or not.  Oh, yeah.  Good point.  That happened to me once with a Pop-Tart, but it was on a metal plate.  Well, it's a hot Pop-Tart.  I'll say.  Yeah.  Well.  Not to worry.  Not to worry.  Stop right.  Not to worry you, but when they make it, the fumes give off a serious toxic nature.  They're hydrogen halides.  Right.  So they say styrofoam should never be worked in an enclosed environment. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Without a graded fume mask or a filter.  Fume mask while you.  Yeah.  It's so bad.  It looks like you have another Pop-Tart to eat.  It does.  It's raised up nice.  It looks like there's an invisible Pop-Tart in this plate.  All right.  You heard the story on the way in, obviously.  That one made me chuckle.  There's a lot of good stuff going on today, but.  The delivery of the story is what made me chuckle, how they said it.  Did we find a good version yet?  I don't know why.  You know, Jimmy's never given the impression that Uncle Paul has. 
[00:08:30]  You know, that he likes young children.  But the second I heard this story, just Jimmy flashed into my head.  It's the sexual deviance thing.  Of course.  I never liked younger.  Listen to me.  Listen.  I just walked to the door.  I don't like children.  No.  You're defending yourself against being a pedo.  Against molesting charges.  No, I really don't.  I have never, nor shall I ever. 
[00:09:00]  I didn't.  I lost that photography job at Geranimals for other reasons.  It's just going to be a nightmare, though, because yesterday we were talking about fetishes.  Yeah.  And every once in a while, sure, I like a nice, big, heavy boob that doesn't, you know.  A weighty one.  Just nice weight to it.  Not sag, weight.  Weight.  You know.  Yeah.  This guy has a whole thing going on.  It's got to be a nightmare.  Oh, he can't.  This thing is a lot different than enjoying a nice, heavy boob every once in a while.  It certainly is. 
[00:09:30]  There's a weirdo with a thing for a little boy.  A weirdo.  Look, I, you know, it's not going to make fun, but when it starts with, oh, weirdo.  The whole thing that got me, it wasn't even so much the story itself.  Yeah.  It's just the way he prefaced the story made me chuckle.  Yeah.  There's a weirdo with a thing for little boys running around the Gramercy Park area.  Cops say he likes to squeeze boys' buttocks.  Does he? 
[00:10:00]  Oh, that's Frank.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  You know this guy, Frank?  Sure.  Sure.  He's harmless.  Oh, is he?  He just squeezes and leaves?  Yeah, we call him squeeze and run, Frank.  Squeeze and run.  Yeah, apparently he's walking up to young boys and squeezing their asses and then leaving.  Getting back to my point, that's a nightmare if that becomes your thing.  He can't, he just can't take it.  Right.  It's his thing.  Right.  It's like if you like, like you said, the nice weighty boob. 
[00:10:30]  Sure.  You like no hair, maybe a lot of hair.  Whatever your thing is.  Whatever you're into.  There's a lot of things that people are into out there.  That's perfectly acceptable.  Right.  At home, in the bedroom, whatever.  Yeah.  But this guy is into young boy buttocks.  Oh, you can't be into young boy buttocks.  You're going to get in Dutch.  Before I forget, Justin from Hoboken, thank you.  Get the story of the guy and the blow-up dolls.  You want to hear?  Yeah, that's a good one.  You haven't heard of this one yet?  Nein. 
[00:11:00]  It's perfect to do right after this one.  Another weirdo.  Our secular deviant.  Here's the story.  There's a weirdo with a thing for little boys running around the Gramercy Park area.  Cops say he likes to squeeze boys' buttocks.  There have been at least five attacks, all in the vicinity of 21st Street and 2nd Avenue,  all in broad daylight in the morning and mid-afternoon.  Of course, in broad daylight.  Yeah, how many young little boys are walking around?  You can't do this under the cover of darkness. 
[00:11:30]  Thank you.  The cover of darkness, which makes it more of a nightmare for this guy, this weirdo.  2nd Avenue, all in broad daylight in the morning and mid-afternoon.  The victims, boys ages 11 to 15, grabbed from behind.  It's really frightening when you think your children are being attacked before they go  to school and after.  It makes you want to keep your hands on them at all times.  Meredith Robilotti calls it sick.  Jesus Diaz says he'd like to see a few more cops on patrol, especially when children are  going to and from school. 
[00:12:00]  A week ago, a public said no.  It takes something like this to go, well, yeah, sure, we know.  We need more cops.  But Diaz also points out there are plenty of police in the area.  The academy is right around the corner.  Al Jones, 10-10 wins in Gramercy Park.  Thank you, Al.  Yeah, right on, Al.  Oh, weirdo.  The guy, yeah, can't keep his hands off the little boy butts.  That 10-10 wins is getting a little braver with their reporting.  Oh, that was the other one?  And to that jerk. 
[00:12:30]  To that pinhead.  Oh, pinhead, right.  Driving 70 miles an hour.  In the ice and snow.  Slow down.  If you're still alive.  Wow.  How about you just report the news?  I'm John Montone squeezing boy buttocks here in Gramercy Park.  He's out at this hour.  He sure is out at this hour.  Maybe imagine it is him.  John Montone, someone's been arrested for squeezing boy buttocks in Gramercy Park, 
[00:13:00]  and it's me, John Montone.  I'm the weirdo.  Why do you squeeze boy buttocks, John?  Well, I like the smoothness and hairlessness.  Hairlessness, indeed.  I'm felon John Montone.  Good old John.  All right, we're going to seg quickly into this before we take a break.  The blow-up doll guy.  Wow.  Wow.  Florida man was arrested yesterday. 
[00:13:30]  Florida man?  The superhero?  I'm Florida man.  Just when you put Florida man.  Arrested yesterday after you spotted fondling and making out with a pair of blow-up dolls in a supermarket parking lot.  How is that illegal?  All right.  It's weird.  I'll give it.  It's weird.  You're in a parking lot.  Yeah.  In a supermarket.  You got two blow-up dolls?  Two.  This guy's good.  Yeah, he's doing a little threesome. 
[00:14:00]  Why not?  And he's making out and fondling the blow-up dolls.  Has anyone ever seen a really good blow-up doll?  No.  They look like, and it's a visual, but you could hear it on the air.  They look like this.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Their hands are up like they're being, they're in a stick-up.  Yeah.  Stick them up.  Yeah.  And then their mouth is like, oh!  Like they're practicing opera.  Yeah.  Oh!  And then the naughty bits always look like they're kind of falling out. 
[00:14:30]  It's horrible.  Absolutely horrible.  And the asses are flatter than Quincy's girlfriend.  Yeah.  They can't figure out how to, like, cut that plastic to make a nice bubble booty on those dolls.  They look ridiculous.  Shoppers called cops when they spotted George, whatever, 51.  Why?  Bartusek, it looks like.  51 getting busy in the front seat of his Lincoln town car.  Is that really getting busy?  Yeah, he was getting busy, they say. 
[00:15:00]  Which is parked directly in front of the, I was going to say the pubic store.  No, the Publix.  Publix store.  According to a police report, witnesses told cops that George was performing activity to  two different blow-up dolls in his vehicle that was consistent with, with, can't say  the M word for doing, doing yourself there, so.  Oh, considered, yeah.  I think I said it.  So, it was consistent with, you know.  Was he doing that? 
[00:15:30]  That was consistent with, I think, no.  He was doing it to the dolls.  Oh!  He was blanking the dolls, not using his, the same hand, you know.  Yeah, using a few, using his hands.  Diddling!  Yeah, yeah, sure.  Sometimes talking around this stuff sucks.  He was also spotted aggressively kissing the dolls.  Oh, big tongue kisses.  Aggressively.  On those horrible round mouth. 
[00:16:00]  Oh!  I would, I'd rather deep kiss my grandma than deep kiss one of these blow-up dolls.  Goes without saying.  Sure.  When confronted by police, George said that he was headed to Target to get some clothes  for his dolls.  Oh, they were naked?  Yeah.  Now I see a problem.  His friend Otto in the back.  Still no problem, because even when these things are naked, they don't look like anything.  No.  Well, they're not real people.  It's a balloon.  It's a balloon.  It's a balloon.  Yeah, sure. 
[00:16:30]  George, charged with breach of peace, was wearing shorts with a three-inch opening in  the crotch area.  Of course he had no underwear on under the shorts, noted police.  So they arrested that weirdo down in Florida, having fun with two blow-up dolls in his car.  Why would he, wouldn't you just find like a, I don't know.  What?  A safer place.  Maybe he likes doing it in public.  Yeah, that's his thing.  Oh, he's crazy.  Yeah.  With his blow-up dolls. 
[00:17:00]  This is all because the economy's going bad, I'm telling you.  Yeah.  If people are starting to lose their minds.  It brings you a freak out.  Right?  Yeah.  It gives you that tick down.  If people are working, they have to have some kind of responsibility.  And they don't have time to do this.  And they don't have time.  Yeah, for the blow-up doll thing.  And then as people start losing their jobs, they get a little crazier.  That perversion pops up.  Yeah.  All right, we're just getting started.  Wow, the Sully audio is just amazing.  We're going to get right into that after the break.  I've yet to hear it.  I haven't either.  It's really good. 
[00:17:30]  Does he use the F word?  The ending sucks, to be honest with you, but the audio itself is really good.  Does he use the F word?  That's a very good question.  We'll find out next.  I wouldn't think.  I bet Sully's like, you know, Mr. Nice Guy.  The F word?  Yes.  Free fall.  If he doesn't use the F word in that situation, what does it take for Sully to use the F word?  That's a question asked.  In his plane?  Huh?  To be shot at while you're in the plane?  He probably would use the F word for that one. 
[00:18:00]  And very good news for all you Pink Panther fans.  Yeah?  Jimmy?  The reviews are in.  That's enough.  And I hold the reviews for the Pink Panther movie in my hand.  What do you think, Jim?  Good or bad reviews?  I mean, I don't personally like it.  I hate it.  Yeah.  And I think everybody else should hate it.  But, uh, I don't know.  I have no faith in people's ability.  Right.  The fact that this will probably make $100 million shows, I don't know what I'm talking about,  so I don't know.  I'm big in. 
[00:18:30]  Can you get it all really?  Please.  I want to do it all day.  Please do that.  Yeah.  Uh, the reviews.  We'll get into those after the break as well.  Opie and Anthony just getting started.  Oh, now we're talking.  I'm the only fan here, but that's okay.  I'll defend my doors any day of the week.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Just telling Ant.  I was reading an article on, um, video phones and all that crap. 
[00:19:00]  The future.  Snopes.  Snopes, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right?  What, Snopes.com?  No, no, no.  Uh, uh, uh, the one that everyone's using on the news, Scopes.  What the hell is it called?  Help me.  Help me, Henry.  Henry.  Sounds like Snopes.  Sounds like Scopes.  All right.  Skype.  Skype.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  Skype, too.  I was, uh, reading about.  Thank you.  Skype.  It's early.  Give us a break.  Or me.  Skype. 
[00:19:30]  These guys are always brilliant.  It takes me a while to warm up to the spring.  And, uh, they were talking about, uh, like video phones and stuff.  Guess what year we were ready for video phones.  I was amazed by this, Jimmy.  Of course.  1951.  No!  All right.  When were we ready?  And what do you mean by ready?  Like, technologically, we had everything.  Yeah.  Ready to go.  That we needed.  Ready to go. 
[00:20:00]  You had the phone lines.  This was a lot easier than people realized.  Yeah?  And they were ready to go with this.  When?  1964.  How did they happen?  And it never caught on because people just didn't want to have to look good for a phone  call.  They just didn't understand that.  They didn't want that.  They liked the privacy of a phone call.  And they even, they even, uh, write in this article about how, like, when you're having  a phone call with someone and they're saying some kind of nonsense and you roll your eyes 
[00:20:30]  and stuff.  Oh, you don't want to see that.  Yeah.  No one wanted to, you know, have to worry about any of that crap.  Yeah.  So they didn't, they just didn't go for it.  They just kind of sat there.  But what about, like, bandwidth problems and compression and all that that they didn't  have back then?  Well.  The feed video through a phone line back then was just preposterous.  Nah.  It took, it took, uh, half your house.  What's the big deal?  You see a postage stamp-sized black and white picture of grandma updating every hour. 
[00:21:00]  Look, what did I tell you?  I read the first two paragraphs.  Oh, right?  That's all you need to know.  Everything you need to know in an article is the first two, maybe three paragraphs.  Yeah.  You know, and then, then the big pages, you got to find the other part of the article.  Who has time for that?  No one.  Jim Gaffigan had a very funny joke about that.  He's like, when you read the paper.  Yeah.  And it says, continue on page 27.  Well, not for me.  It isn't.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Every time I see that in either magazines or papers continued on, I, yeah. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  You lost me.  I'm out.  I'm out.  And, uh, Skype, they're just like, uh.  Well, now it's, the new Skype is ridiculous.  Yeah.  Hey, click around.  Ah, hold on a minute.  I'm going to talk to this person for a little while.  Hello.  There you are.  Hi.  Because I'm.  Kind of like a pal.  It's a pal talk.  I'm a pal talk guy, but, uh, you know, I'm willing to try anything.  Mm-hmm.  Any, any technology.  Uh, but it was ready to go, I guess, because the market wasn't like rah, rah.  It kind of just sat there and they weren't developing it to something that could have been cool. 
[00:22:00]  Don't they realize they could have, like, had the phone where you can shut the picture part off  and just have a regular phone, and then if you are gussied up for the phone call,  and maybe you want to see the kids across the country, uh, then you, you would use the,  um.  Ah, the people that came before us.  Very stupid people.  Very stupid back then.  Yeah, they're not, uh, they weren't the brightest people.  No.  We're the brightest people.  Of course we are.  And now people will get dumb again, because we're the greatest generation.  We're the greatest.  We got lots of cool stuff.  Uh, we're going to do, uh, we're going to do, uh, we're going to do the Hudson audio tapes 
[00:22:30]  in a minute.  The Sully tapes.  Oh, yes, Sully.  But, I mean, Jimmy's clamoring over here.  Let's get this done.  Pink Panther 2 comes out today.  Who's not excited?  Wow.  I can't wait.  Hack that theater.  Dude, I went to sleep, and I, I, I rarely pray.  I'm not really sure where I stand with religion.  Yes.  Especially organized religion.  That, I know where I stand.  And, uh, I prayed that the Pink Panther would have horrible reviews this morning. 
[00:23:00]  I actually, I actually kneeled beside my bed old school.  Jesus, please.  Right.  If you're a movie fan, Jesus, please, please, please trash this movie and make sure it gets  bad reviews.  And you know what?  That praying works.  Yeah.  Pink Panther 2, 5% positive reviews on RottenTomatoes.com.  5%.  5%.  Has anything ever gotten 1%? 
[00:23:30]  I don't know.  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  What's this there?  Oh, Pink, we have to do the trailer clips again?  Oh, please, there's a howl.  And we, uh, we made the reviews.  What?  We made the reviews.  Some dude in, uh, Richmond.  Richmond.com.  Uh, it would have been less insulting for Martin to dig up Peter Sellers' corpse, build  a bone xylophone out of the skeletal remains, and bang out Henry Mancini's Pink Panther  theme during the Super Bowl halftime show. 
[00:24:00]  And then he writes, by the way, if you have Sirius XM satellite radio, be sure to listen  to Opie and Anthony Lambace, the movie, as they've been roasting the trailer for weeks.  How great is that?  How great is that?  That is a great line with the playing Henry Mancini's Pink Panther on his ribs.  Just some of, uh, the better, bad reviews for Pink Panther 2.  Sacramento News and Review. 
[00:24:30]  Devoid of laughs or suspense.  Filmcritic.com.  Pathetic.  The lack of imagination and inspiration is stunning.  Uh, Cole Smithy, or Smythey.  The only good side effect here is that it can remind audiences of Peter Sellers' truly inspired  comic films.  If you want to see a Pink Panther movie, you've still got to watch the original.  Something we've been saying all along.  Yeah.  Where, Jimmy made a good point during the break.  Where were these guys before the movie came out yelling and screaming, going, what the  hell is this guy doing? 
[00:25:00]  After part one, where were they?  Or during part one, where were they?  Yeah.  He's a thief.  Steve Martin's a thief.  Is, is that, uh, the cover, Steve Martin standing next to a giant pink two?  Is that what the, uh, poster is?  Yes, the blue poster.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Because it is.  That's what it is.  It's number two.  It should be a brown number two.  And so is he.  Washington Post.  That's a big paper, right?  Plays like a series of disconnected hit or miss skits in a cut rate Saturday night live.  Oh, oh.  Cut rate.  So far the best is richmond.com. 
[00:25:30]  Got to give those guys some props today.  Belief Net.  I've seen taxidermy livelier than this.  Wow.  Stump frame.  Big word.  Alert.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Moribund.  Moribund.  The mess.  Which further sullies the reputation of everyone.  Sully?  Why bring him into it?  Associated with this unwelcome sequel.  And then efilmcritic.com.  A film in which nothing particularly amusing happens unless the sight of a group of well-known  performers squandering their talents in exchange for, presumably, uh, hefty paychecks, uh, 
[00:26:00]  strikes you as the apex of contemporary comedy.  The Daily News gave it three out of five stars.  And he bashes it.  What?  What do you stars mean?  The Daily News bashes it?  And, again, I despise the critics even more than Steve Martin.  Look closer.  Maybe they're not stars.  Maybe they're little turds.  He gave it three turds.  Three turds.  It says, uh, Martin starts at the outrageous accent and spins out from there, and that's 
[00:26:30]  fine for this.  And there are a few snicker-worthy scenes.  Three stars against snicker-worthy?  But when Clouseau responds to an order to fly to Rome with, but I can't fly.  Holy mother of Jesus, that line isn't in the movie.  Oh, yeah, it is.  Don't even tell me that line is in the movie.  The Post, again, brutalizes, and they quote that movie as well.  Oh, here's a line to the quote.  But I can't fly! 
[00:27:00]  That better be the reaction it gets in the movie theater.  Either that or just gunfire into the screen.  The movie hopes to be regarded as childlike, too, but there's a difference between kid-friendly  and just regular old dumb.  What is this key piece of evidence?  Clouseau barks.  Oh, what is this key piece of evidence?  Clouseau barks.  The Garcia character holds up a key.  This sucks.  I get it. 
[00:27:30]  A key piece of evidence.  Be more funny!  Oh, da-da-da-da!  This is going great!  Wow.  A key piece of evidence, and it's a key.  You just don't get it.  This unfunny douche.  Steve Martin's an unfunny douche.  Have some pride.  And he co-wrote it.  He co-wrote it.  Of course he did.  Executive produced, co-wrote.  I'm sure he's making billions off of this thing worldwide. 
[00:28:00]  You watch.  Here's a guy.  The French will love it.  They look at him like Jerry Lewis.  Obi-Wan Cannoli just doesn't get it.  Obi-Wan Cannoli?  The Obi-Wan Cannoli from Queens.  That's a pretty good name.  I like it.  But what he writes, I guess he hasn't been listening to us for too long.  He has to see, actually.  It's called a remake, guys, and they all suck.  We know that.  We've been saying that.  We're not fans of remakes of comedies.  Let me tell you.  He's been saying that for years.  Some remakes are fine.  I liked the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  I liked the remake of The Hills Have Eyes. 
[00:28:30]  Those remakes work well.  Horror is genre remakes because you can make them look a little more realistic.  You could make them more brutal.  Things like that.  Those are fun.  Friday the 13th coming out next week, I guess, on the 13th.  I'm looking forward to seeing that because the original one was like, all right, whatever.  It's a classic horror movie.  Slasher film.  But it's kind of fun to watch the remakes of those.  Something, the comedies are so hard to remake. 
[00:29:00]  First of all, the joke's been done, so it's hard to redo a joke and make it at least as funny as the original.  And for someone like Steve Martin to do this poor impression of Inspector Clouseau is ridiculous and just embarrassing.  What does this mean?  Beguiling panache.  P-A-N-A-C-H-E.  What does panache mean?  That's me.  I have beguiling panache. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, panache.  Yes, panache.  Well, read the last line.  That's really it.  About the trombones.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Listen to this.  Oh, no.  The soundtrack makes generous use of the trombones to indicate humor.  Oh, my God.  When you have to throw trombones in to pump up the laughs.  Can we pump up our laughs today with trombones? 
[00:30:00]  Do we have any trombones?  Oh.  Brr.  Brr.  Every time Anthony has a doozy this morning, I'm going to do a little trombone for everyone.  Brr.  Brr.  Oh, God.  That's hard when you've got to do that.  How many different sounds can you make with a trombone?  You can make a lot of wacky, uh-oh, look at what's coming next, the sound.  It's like, brr, brr, brr.  Is that trombone-y?  You can go like, brr, brr, brr.  This is too high-pitched for a trombone.  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  You get the idea.  You can go like, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Make those wacky sounds.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Here's a good one.  By the scene, more typically, here's Clouseau with his tiny lapels and his tiny hat, getting  into a tiny car, barely bigger than his tiny mustache.  So what happens?  He takes his hands off the wheel, obliging his partner to steer.  End of scene.  Tiny bit of comedy.  Wow.  That scene should have ended like Jane Mansfield's ride. 
[00:31:00]  What a bum he is.  What a bum.  I wish his partner was Harry Chapin.  Just going off the door.  Piggybacking off of your horrific death in a car humor.  I know.  Wish it was a motorcycle of old Jimmy D driving.  Yes.  The sad part, they will make a third movie.  Because Roy asked in Boston, he writes, Pink Panther, the original, that came out in 2006.  Wow.  24% positive reviews.  So the movie was a stinker. 
[00:31:30]  Yep.  Made an S-load of money.  So they said, hey, we've got to make a second one.  Now the second one's coming out at so far 5% positive reviews.  But you watch.  Monday, we're going to sit here depressed.  It's going to be the number one movie in America.  It will be.  Why is that?  Who's excited?  Why is that?  To go see this.  Who's sitting there going, guess what's coming out today?  Let's go see it.  We'll take the whole Ding Dong family.  Are we that bored as a society?  We just like walk to the movie theaters like lemmings?  I must see Pink Panther 2 because they told us on TV. 
[00:32:00]  People are stupid.  And I guess other people that make entertainment try too hard.  We're trying much too hard as people that really do want to put across something good.  Right.  You can just put out crap.  Put out crap.  Put out hacky garbage.  And people will eat it up.  They love it.  Is the trailer bad?  I don't know if I've even heard the trailer for it.  I'm sure it's bad, right?  Is this the old trailer?  I don't know.  This is a tractor trailer running over the set. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, bitch.  The reason it bothers me so much is because he's a thief.  It's like a bad comedy is a bad comedy.  That happens.  Yeah.  But the fact that Steve Martin is a bonafide thief.  Yes.  Is what makes me sick to my stomach.  Yeah, let's say hi to Chris.  Chris, how are you, buddy?  Good evening, boys.  Good evening.  How are you, Jimmy?  Hey, buddy.  Thanks.  Yeah, I just wanted to make sure you guys didn't miss Steve Martin playing his banjo on Colbert  before last night. 
[00:33:00]  Yuck, yuck, yuck.  Really?  No.  Steve Colbert.  Did he go after him a little bit?  He, well, Colbert, Colbert goes after the people that you never heard of, like the authors.  But, you know, he kind of, like, he sucked up to Steve Martin.  And Colbert rips out, uh, Colbert bought out a guitar, and he, uh, Colbert pretended he  could play guitar, but then he just sucked, and then Steve Martin just started rambling  away on his banjo.  I guess he could, I guess he had nothing good to say about his movie, but. 
[00:33:30]  Come on, Colbert.  That's what I like about the guy.  Nothing.  He dropped his shot.  No one is calling Steve Martin out.  Why not?  No one.  Why?  Because he stole this role, and he sucks at it, and he never should have been allowed to  do it.  They seem as some kind of goddamn royalty.  He's not.  Randy has a good question.  I mean, we all have the answer here, but ask away, Randy.  Could it be possible to just, you know, folks are going and, like, watching it just to 
[00:34:00]  have something to goof on?  Because we used to do that to the old black and white movies, get high and watch them.  I'm sure there's a very, very small.  The defiant ones?  A very small percentage.  That is doing that, Randy.  That's funny.  A patch of blue, just going there and boo.  Boo.  A patch of blue.  Stupid Selena.  Yeah.  Nah, maybe a small percentage.  Oops, look what I just took home.  Yeah, I don't think so, dude.  I would love to believe that, but I just don't think so.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:34:30]  So that's what's going on with the Pink Panther movie that we've all been waiting for.  Pink Panther 2.  Well, a talk show host is never going to call this guy out.  What is the value of having him on now?  It's just he's a guy who's just stealing stuff.  Yeah.  So irritating.  Does he do the character when he goes on the talk shows?  I bet he does.  Hello, Dave.  Embarrassment.  What a complete embarrassment he is.  He is an embarrassment.  Hey, we don't ask for much as far as our movies go. 
[00:35:00]  No.  You know.  Obviously.  Hollywood knows that.  Oh, they'll eat this one up.  Yeah.  You know, we have very low standards for what we'll go see.  And number one at the box office over the weekend.  You're going to hear it.  It's a guarantee.  What else comes out?  It's a lock.  Yeah.  What else is coming out that could beat it?  And they strategically put it out.  It's a slow time of the year as far as movies go.  That whole thing.  Nothing else.  Nothing else going on.  Wait.  What?  You got Drew Barrymore.  He's just not that into you.  That's a chick flick.  I know. 
[00:35:30]  I like Drew Barrymore.  But I'm not watching her in a chick flick.  I haven't liked Drew Barrymore since E.T.  Every goddamn movie she puts out is some drivel.  Just drivel romantic comedy crapola.  I didn't say I liked her in movies.  I just like her.  She's got a little of that skate.  Just a little bit.  She's getting a little more as the years go by, too.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I liked her in Cat's Eye.  Cat's Eye?  Yeah.  It was kind of good when she played the tard. 
[00:36:00]  She plays a good retard, doesn't she?  Oh, daddy.  She went full retard, by the way.  Really?  Oh, she went full retard in that one.  I'm out of this one.  I didn't see that.  Oh, Cat's Eye.  It's a little compilation of Stephen King short stories made into film.  Yeah.  That's a fun movie to watch.  And full retard.  Quitters, Inc. is the best one with James Woods.  He can't smoke, so he goes to a place to get him to quit smoking. 
[00:36:30]  And by the time you get in there and you're in, it's too late to back out.  It's like the mob's version of making you quit smoking.  So they watch you constantly.  And if you smoke a cigarette the first time, do you remember what the first, second, and  third ones were, Danny?  Well, I think if memory serves, if they catch you smoking once, they take your wife.  Yeah.  And they put your wife in this room that has an electrified floor.  Electric floor.  And you watch through a glass panel as she gets electric shock.  Yeah, but they play like some wacky music. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, yeah.  They just play just to further embarrass you.  And then the second time, I think they take your kid and do the same thing.  Yeah.  And the kid was Drew Barrymore, and she's the retard.  And then the third time, I believe they kill your wife or something like that.  No, I think the third offense, they cut off your wife's pinky.  Oh, I thought that was if you gained too much weight.  Oh, is that what it was?  Yeah.  I have no idea.  I wish I had known we were even going to talk about this. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, do they rape your wife or something?  Second offense, they rape your wife.  This is a comedy, right?  No.  It's great, but there's one scene where James Woods is in traffic.  Yeah.  He's stuck in rush hour traffic.  There's an accident or something.  And he's like, I know people are watching me and stuff.  And he's all pissed.  So he bangs on the dashboard, and the glove compartment opens, and there's a pack of cigarettes sitting there.  So he's like, oh, he's looking around.  He's looking.  He's stuck in dead stop traffic.  How could anyone be watching him?  So he lights up a cigarette as he's bent down underneath, like, the dashboard. 
[00:38:00]  And the face he makes when he's smoking, because he, like, takes a drag.  It feels good.  And he makes a smile, like, I got you, you best, because you can't see me everywhere.  And then he pops up out of his seat, and there's a guy just staring at him, smiling with a smirk, like, all right.  It really is.  Gotcha.  It's the most.  Yeah, Danny popped it up.  It's on YouTube, I guess.  His dumb face is so stupid.  His dumb face, yeah.  And then he just sees a guy making out with some chick next to him, and then there's other people stuck in traffic. 
[00:38:30]  So kids in front of him, like, having a pillow fight in a station wagon.  So he's down here smoking, and his face is so, he's so satisfied that he pulled one over on these guys.  Like that, I beat the system face.  Yeah.  Oh, it's a drawbridge.  That was it.  A drawbridge went up, stuck him in traffic.  He's fanned in the way to smoke.  And look at him.  He's like, he's like, yeah, I got him.  Where's the guy?  He's popping up after smoking a little bit.  Oh, now the traffic moves, so the horn is blowing.  So he puts the cigarette out. 
[00:39:00]  Very pleased.  And then he just looks at the guy next to him, smiling.  Oh, damn.  The guy tips his hat, drives away.  Oh, damn.  The guy's got him.  And there's his wife getting electric shots in the chamber.  God, you just turned me on to something.  I've got to see this now.  Check this movie out.  It's a bunch of short little stories.  There's about four or five of them, I guess.  And they're all Stephen King short stories.  I was a huge Stephen King fan growing up.  I read everything. 
[00:39:30]  Everything.  There's no one better.  And they're playing such wacky music when she's dancing around because she's getting electric.  She's trying to keep her feet off the ground.  Yeah, Cat's Eye is the name.  We've got to take a break.  If we're going to talk about Drew Barrymore, let's just throw it in there that Poison Ivy ruled.  All right.  I'll give you Poison Ivy.  All right.  Poison Ivy was great.  When, what's his name there from Top Gun there, Tom Skerritt was banging her by the piano.  Yeah.  What have we got here? 
[00:40:00]  Well, you're a friend of my daughter's.  What have we got here?  Favorite scenario.  Why don't we go by the piano?  Dad was always watching TV by himself late at night.  Yeah.  Well, there was a pajama party going on.  Where was the wife?  Upstairs just sleeping away.  Yeah.  Snoozing.  And then you had the little nymph always had to come downstairs because she wasn't tired.  Fantastic.  Oh, Mr. Jones.  I didn't know you were still up.  I was thirsty. 
[00:40:30]  I needed a glass of milk.  Well, it's right in the refrigerator.  Right.  Why don't I help you out?  Oh, we can't do this.  You're not wearing a shirt.  You're a friend of my daughter's.  Are you kidding me?  This happened?  Just now.  What the hell?  What?  Sully brought another one in?  Well, guess what?  What?  It's all about Sully until today.  What happened?  Breaking news out of Australia.  We'll get more info after the break.  A Sully sequel. 
[00:41:00]  A small plane forced to land in the water.  Everyone lives.  Small plane, though?  Come on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The water was only two feet deep, so.  It was a puddle on the runway.  And the water was probably.  What kind of plane?  You're not talking an Airbus.  And the water was probably 80 degrees, right?  It's the mini Sully version.  It's summer down there.  We're calling it a Sully sequel.  Oh, Sully sequel.  That's not a Sully sequel.  Again.  It looks like a seaplane.  The sequel sucks.  And they're walking off the plane, and they're in ankle deep water.  Who's the pilot?  Steve Martin? 
[00:41:30]  With their luggage.  Now every time it rains, it's a water landing.  It's a seaplane.  Wait a minute.  Look at the pontoons on the wings.  A seaplane?  It was flown by women?  Yeah.  If you want to see the greatest sea of all time on film, by the way.  Yeah.  Well, this could be something we throw out to the audience.  Nurse Ratched.  Wow.  Very good.  Wow.  You might have just.  I think I've just. 
[00:42:00]  You just might have wrecked a bit.  The whole pit right there, because she.  I saw Doubt last night.  Philip Seymour Hoffman, Meryl Streep.  Yeah.  Movie was good.  It was good.  Good.  Could have been a lot better.  The acting, ridiculous.  Meryl Streep plays one of the biggest C's in film history.  Really?  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  She is America's greatest actress of all time.  Well, that's a break.  We'll take some phone calls.  Who was the biggest C in film history?  Ratchet.  I might have.  That's right up there.  You might have ruined it.  Ratchet might have ruined it, because.  You couldn't start off with somebody not as high. 
[00:42:30]  When he turns to the doctor and goes, yeah, well, she's a badder.  He's like, I hate to break up your party, but you're something of a C, ain't you, Doc?  Something of a C.  Something of a C.  That's what he said.  I like to doubt.  They could have had a car crash or two, just to kind of, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why not?  It would have nothing to do with what they were trying to accomplish, but it would have  kept me interested for a little longer.  Quick break.  We'll continue.  We got to sell the audio.  I guess we'll do that after the break.  We'll try to figure out who the biggest C is. 
[00:43:00]  Grammys on Sunday, so let's do a little Grammy thing here.  Grammy moment or whatever the hell we're calling it.  It's an Opie and Anthony Grammy Minute.  Best hard rock performance.  Disturbed.  Incentivator.  Give your soul to me for eternity.  Release your life to begin another time with her.  End your grief with me.  There's another way.  Release your life. 
[00:43:30]  Take your place inside the fire with her.  Expand your Grammy knowledge base with Opie and Anthony.  Good morning, Opie and Anthony.  How was Caroline's, Jimmy?  It was great.  It was really a nice crowd last night.  But what if I missed it? 
[00:44:00]  Well, funny you should ask me.  I was supposed to only do Thursday.  And they said, Jim, it's going so good.  Right.  I have two shows tonight.  Both shows tomorrow.  Apparently, I completely sold out.  No, say it's not sold.  Uh-oh.  And I have told you.  One show Sunday.  But it was actually a great crowd.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So you got tickets for Sunday's show.  Yeah.  And maybe a few for tonight.  Yeah, but tomorrow, forget about it.  If you want to see Jimmy tonight, you got to call right away.  When are they open for business?  I don't know.  212-757-4100.  Yeah.  Let's say you want to see Jim Norton. 
[00:44:30]  Jim Norton.  Hey, we're going to get to the Sully audio in a second or two here.  Michael Phelps.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Michael Phelps has been, what, dropped?  Yes.  Kellogg's.  Kellogg's.  Kellogg's dropped him, right?  He said, smoke your pot and walk him.  And they suspended him from the swim team.  What are you doing?  Yeah, three-month suspension.  Who else do you got?  What are you doing?  What, are you going to put a dolphin in his place?  What are you doing?  Yeah.  They're doing it four years before they need him again. 
[00:45:00]  They know what they're doing.  Of course.  This is a way to publicly slap him on the wrist.  Yeah.  And go, all right, shame on you, but we still need you for, what is it, 2012?  Big goofball he is.  Yeah.  I'm just watching him on the news over here.  He's a big doofus.  He'll be fine.  It's pot.  And then, well, I hear what South Carolina wants to pursue criminal charges.  It's like, just stop it, South Carolina.  You know what?  All right.  You mentioned it, so we should play really fast.  It's a quickie.  This guy's just trying to get his name in the news. 
[00:45:30]  Of course he is.  That's all this is all about.  I mean, everyone else is like, whatever, he smoked a little pot.  What are you going to do?  But this guy.  In South Carolina, a sheriff is looking into slapping Michael Phelps with criminal charges  because of this picture.  One lawyer says he thinks there's enough evidence for a drug bust and Phelps won't be treated  any differently.  The gold medalist has apologized for the incident, and it appears, for now, the Swimmers' corporate  sponsors are standing behind him.  Ah, well, no, that's a couple days old.  Now Kellogg's is bailed. 
[00:46:00]  It's not like that's a big company or anything.  He should be all right.  How much do you think he lost from that alone?  Oh, Kellogg's.  That's got to be, I would guess that's a million easy.  You know.  That's an easy million he just lost.  Wouldn't you love to know the scumbag who took this picture?  This is a nation of vultures.  We're just predators.  That is really such a sleazy thing to do to it.  Apparently a friend who was there, you know, snaps a picture of you.  Yeah.  Smoking a little bong.  Taking a little bong.  How many of the Kellogg's people smoke pot, though? 
[00:46:30]  You know what's ironic?  I used to love a nice big bowl of cornflakes after I got high.  That was, you know, I think.  Why can't the potheads go?  You know what?  Well, now we're not going to eat your stuff.  Because they'd smoke one tube and then just be like, oh, I'm so hungry.  It's in there.  Cornflakes.  I love them.  Then boycott Fruity Pebbles or something.  I have nothing to do with Kellogg's.  Post a bunch of dumps spray.  It's so ridiculous that the guy, obviously, he's able to handle his weed, knows when and 
[00:47:00]  when not to smoke it.  Apparently he was fine for the Olympics, all the drug testing, and he's winning so many  gold medals.  What's the problem with pot?  And how old is he?  23, 24?  Yeah.  What do you think he's supposed to be doing when he's not getting gold medals?  I don't understand the problem with weed.  Like, it's so ridiculous that there's a problem with pot when booze is fine. 
[00:47:30]  I've seen more people so much more effed up from booze than weed ever.  Of course.  Because they haven't figured out how to make money.  People can smoke a lot of pot, sit on the couch, or even, you know, not just, and function.  You know, you can tell they're stoned and everything.  But I've seen people that are drunk that cannot, they lose consciousness.  They die from drinking too much.  You can die from drinking too much.  I've never heard of anyone dying from smoking too much pot. 
[00:48:00]  That's a hell of an endorsement for pot too.  This guy was fast in the pool.  Yeah.  Doesn't pot slow you down a little bit?  Apparently not for him.  He's great.  You want to try to figure out who the biggest C in movie history is?  Yes.  Yes.  This just comes from, I saw the movie Doubt last night, which was all right.  And Meryl Streep plays this old nun.  That's a huge C.  And I was trying to think who was the biggest C in movie history, and then it gives me the  Nurse Ratched.  Nurse Ratched.  Which is, well. 
[00:48:30]  I think Nurse Ratched's a bigger C than Meryl Streep.  Yeah.  In this movie, Doubt.  In order not to ruin the whole bit, we can just call it the Nurse Ratched Who's the Biggest  C Award.  Nice.  I like how you say it.  So she's taken ahead of it.  Yes.  The honorable, yes.  It's the first annual Mildred Ratched Awards.  Mildred Ratched.  Remember when Nicholson calls her Mildred?  Right.  Mildred.  Mildred.  Oh, boy.  What a horrible name.  Let's say hi to Fontaine.  Good morning, boy.  Hi, Fontaine. 
[00:49:00]  Taylor's checking in.  How are you, Fontaine?  Hey, I got two big seats from movies.  The first one is Carrie Fisher from the Blues Brothers.  What a seat.  A little comedic.  Nah, that wasn't that bad.  She's just a jilted woman.  Yes.  Notice the lack of a reaction, so that fell short, Fontaine.  You got another one?  Yeah.  Surly Trucker from Spider-Man.  Surly Trucker.  All right.  I like that because a black guy did a frunkist, so I'll accept that.  Yeah.  And then Carrie Fisher from Star Wars.  He just hates Carrie Fisher. 
[00:49:30]  Ken in Montreal.  Montreal.  Montreal.  Love you guys.  Love Jimmy Norton.  But I got to go with Sharon Stone from Casino.  It was the biggest C in movie history.  Sharon Stone, what do you think?  She did have a pretty big C part in it, but then she winds up being pretty pathetic and  just kind of, you know, she doesn't have C longevity in that movie.  How hot is the scene when she has to, you know, how hot is that?  Pesci's off her facelift head on the back of her. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  She's forced to do that.  You need a sponsor?  You want me to be your sponsor?  Yeah.  Now, she was just a drug addict.  She wasn't evil.  She was just a drug addict who was cheating, probably banging Lester, who you know was  a better bang than Ace.  He had to be.  He was a junkie and he's James Woods.  He notoriously has a penis.  Oh, yeah.  Built for photography.  Casino Hold Up.  The movie Casino Hold Up.  Yeah, I like Casino.  I think so, yeah.  Yeah.  Let's go to Jeff in New Hampshire.  Jeff. 
[00:50:30]  Biggest C in the movie, Mark Wahlberg's mom in Boogie Nights.  Well, she was pretty bad, but...  Yeah, she was bad.  She was bad.  I'll give you that she was quite a C, yeah.  She was very mean to that young man.  We're getting something in here that we can't do this until they make the Anthony and Jennifer  story.  Making Meryl Streep look like a sweetheart. 
[00:51:00]  God damn it.  Who's a bigger C than...  Well, I got privy to the feedback, so I got a good one that came in a lot, so I can't  give individual credit, but Kathy Bates, Misery.  Ah.  Oh, wow.  She's kind of crazy.  Big C.  And this might be the winner right here.  Beating out Nurse Ratched, my friend.  Let's say hi to Tony on Long Island.  Tony.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Love the show.  Yeah.  Hey, man.  It's got to be Joan Crawford.  Lesbian, slept with every guy, adopted a whole bunch of kids, and then beat the you-know-what 
[00:51:30]  out of them.  Mommy Dearest.  Mommy Dearest, Joan Crawford.  That's pretty good movie C right there.  That's up there.  Yeah.  That's up there.  Kathy Bates, Misery, has shot a state trooper in the chest.  Yeah.  And broke a man's feet with a sledgehammer.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  That trumps...  That's pretty bad.  Although, we're going for the true definition of a C. 
[00:52:00]  You know what I mean?  She was like just cuckoo.  She was like a maniac.  Maniac.  Yeah.  So don't get confused.  We're looking for that C.  You know.  Yeah.  It's kind of hard to define because it kind of overlaps into areas of homicidal maniac.  Right, right.  Things like that.  Like Nurse Ratched is a very good example of a C.  Yes.  She was very, like, controlled.  Prim.  Yes, prim.  Always trying to be the proper woman and everything.  But that C oozed through that fake front that she put up. 
[00:52:30]  Okay, but Ope's right.  We're looking for the definition of a C.  Kathy Bates was a nut.  Yeah.  She wasn't necessarily a C.  She was crazy.  She had some C in her.  Yeah.  Well, maybe not in her, but...  Then you could call, you know, Jason Voorhees' mother a C, you know, but she was just kind  of a...  How about...  By the way, Mike pointed someone out.  Mike, I gotta say, it was Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction.  Oh, yeah.  That's a C.  That was a C.  That's a good C right there. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Let's go to 13-year-old JC.  We're taking a little break from our bit to get a little more info out on the Michael Phelps  situation.  JC, how are you, buddy?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Just an update on Michael Phelps.  When he won the eight golds in the Olympics, he got $10 million from Kellogg's, but within  seven days, he got $100 million from other companies.  So it isn't really that big of a deal.  But he lost $10 million?  Well, no, no, no.  It's a big deal that he lost $10 million, but of all the money that he made after the 
[00:53:30]  Olympics, it wasn't...  I understand what you're saying, but...  Well, his deal expired.  Did they let it expire?  They didn't fire him.  The deal expired.  He's not renewed.  And he's not renewed.  And they probably wouldn't have renewed him for the same amount of money.  But other sponsors have come forward and said, oh, they're staying behind him and, you  know, handed him over all kinds of cash.  Yeah.  Some of those watch companies.  All right, JC.  Thank you.  See you, buddy.  All right.  Let's say hi to Ryan in Indiana.  Ryan.  Tired country of Columbia.  Good evening.  Kind of.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For my money, the biggest C is Jenny from Forrest Gump for leading that dummy along his whole 
[00:54:00]  life when she bangs everything in size.  And then finally gets him when she has the AIDS.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the biggest C for my money.  Yeah.  Jenny from Forrest Gump.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a very good example of a C.  A wicked stepmother in Cinderella.  The mother in Blow.  I don't remember the mother in Blow.  No.  I don't remember her.  I was concentrating too much on the daughter. 
[00:54:30]  Another really hot scene.  No.  Not hot.  That was a really hot scene, man.  No.  Yes.  Yes.  That's right.  Thumbs up from one of the interns.  When the black guy is just banging the daughter because she needs the drug so bad.  Is that Michael Douglas who was like pounding on the door or whatever?  Oh, yeah.  That was dirt.  That's a pretty hot scene.  Wow.  You know, Ryan in Canada.  Let's go on.  I think he's got a good one too.  Hey there, Ryan.  How you doing, boys?  Hey, you Canuck.  Kathleen Turner in the War of the Roses with Michael Douglas. 
[00:55:00]  That divorce and must bring up some memories.  That is a hell of a movie, man.  Yeah.  You watch that.  Danny DeVito is great in it too as a lawyer.  But the entire movie is nothing but her torturing him and him torturing her.  But he still loves her.  She hates this man.  And when they fall to their death at the end and he just leans over and kind of grabs her hand 
[00:55:30]  and her last movement in life is knocking his hand away from her.  Perfect.  She is quite the C in that one.  But Nurse Ratched was calculating.  Yes, yes.  She kept McMurphy there.  When he could have left, they're like, we should send him back to jail.  And then she's like, that's just one way of pushing our problems onto someone else.  She wanted him committed so she could beat him.  She could win.  Right.  And Billy started to get better and stopped stuttering.  She mentioned his mother just to win him again.  She was the worst. 
[00:56:00]  Karen in Goodfellas is coming in.  She's dumb.  She's stupid.  I'm sorry.  Parker Posey from Dazed and Confused.  I haven't seen Dazed in a while.  Let's go with Russ in Queens.  Hey, Russ, what do you got?  Hey.  You guys are the best, first of all.  Of course.  Thanks.  I'm going to have to say Annette Bening, who is Kevin Spacey's wife in American Beauty.  Yeah, that's a good one.  She was a good C.  I don't remember.  Yes, sir?  Yes, sir? 
[00:56:30]  Yes, that's up there.  Let's say hi to Jared in Boston.  Gerald.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good, Jared.  How about the mom?  I forgot the character's name, but Bad Boy Bubby.  Bad Boy Bubby.  Thank God you're keeping that alive and well.  That movie is so effing twisted.  The first half hour is some of the greatest stuff I've ever seen on film.  It is twisted.  Then the movie just takes a turn and you don't know where it's going.  I don't know if we have time to discuss Bad Boy Bubby today, but remind us.  We'll discuss it maybe next week or something. 
[00:57:00]  We haven't talked about that movie in a while.  Thank you, Jared.  John in Queens.  John.  Yeah, Hilary Swank's mother in Million Dollar Baby.  Yes.  Yes.  She was terrible.  She was horrendous.  She was horrible.  All right, you get the point, I guess.  There's a lot of C's out there on film.  Yep.  Meryl Streep in Devil Wears Prada.  Yeah, she was a big C in that movie.  I think we've pretty much done most of them, right?  Yeah.  Mother in Gone Baby Gone.  She was pretty bad.  You remember Gone Baby Gone? 
[00:57:30]  Oh, yeah.  Also from The Wire.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Season two.  Oh, my God.  Season two.  All right.  Which one?  Which one?  Bob's got one.  Bob!  I defy you to poo-poo this one.  All right, Bob.  You got Anthony's attention.  Yes.  Yeah.  Adrian Barbeau in Creepshow.  Oh.  The what?  Oh.  Say.  I want to say.  It makes me want to say the words.  Say it.  That's how big of a...  Say it.  Say it. 
[00:58:00]  Say it.  What did you do so bad?  You're too responsible.  Say it.  No, no.  They're ready down the hall.  Say it.  Say it.  No, I'm not going to try it.  Say it.  No.  No.  Say it.  Those sheets go to places.  It's irresponsible just to say it, even though we know that there's electronics in place.  Things are breaking down.  Come on.  We don't know what works or doesn't.  Come on.  I'll do the first part.  Professional Broadcast.  Say this a second.  No.  You can even delay and then we're safe.  But there you go.  I didn't say anything.  I spit.  Where was she?  How bad was she? 
[00:58:30]  She was so horrific as a wife.  And the husband, again, I always have a mental block with his name.  Can we see a picture of him?  What about the boobies, though?  He was the guy I just mentioned from Capricorn 1 the other day.  What about the boobies?  Herb Douglas?  Come on.  Nice and heavy.  No.  Oh, yeah.  No.  I can see his face.  He, yeah, she was just this domineering, overbearing, drunken wife that was just horrible to her husband. 
[00:59:00]  And her husband works at a college and finds this old wooden box.  And apparently it comes from, yeah.  Oh, Hal Holbrook.  Yeah, Hal Holbrook.  There it is.  And this wooden box contains what amounts to an abominable snowman.  But it's not like a big happy one.  It's a vicious creature.  And he lures, and he lures his sea wife into the college and under the stairs where this box is. 
[00:59:30]  He tells her that some college student's been raped and viciously attacked by one of his colleagues.  And that she just has to see it.  And she's laughing.  And she's laughing.  And she's like, what did he do to her?  And then the monster gets her and eats her.  And then she kept going, oh, you can just call me Billy.  And while it's eating her, Hal Holbrook's cringing and just going, just tell it to call you Billy.  It's fantastic.  And he fantasizes about shooting her in the head?  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, she is horrid in that movie.  Worse than Nurse Ratched?  Different.  A different type of sea.  But equally as bad.  I mean, I couldn't imagine living with this woman.  Fredo's wife from Godfather 2 is pretty bad, too.  Oh, yeah.  She was just a drunk.  Never marry a wop.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  It's fantastic.  Summer St. Adrian Barbeau in Back to School as well.  Mom and Grandma in Flowers in the Attic. 
[01:00:30]  Did not see that movie.  Glenn Close in Dangerous Liaisons.  Sarah Michelle Gellar in Cruel Intention.  Some of the other ones coming in.  Biggest see in movie history.  That's great.  Watching the footage after Hal Holbrook blew her brains out.  He's fantasizing about shooting her.  And people are applauding him.  Give him the golf clap.  He has this all-shucked smile on him.  Yeah, he's like this smile.  And then he's back to reality.  And she's just bitching at him.  Oh, Henry.  You're just a piece of crap.  You're nothing without me.  What would you do without me? 
[01:01:00]  You're like a little child.  It's all she does is lambast this guy the whole movie.  Again, that's another collection of great little stories.  Found a friend, Harry.  Let's go around to Stephen King's short story.  I know.  Why not?  It's a great show.  How can anyone think Stephen King sucks?  Who does?  He's literary snobs.  Oh, literary snobs hate him.  They think his books are trash.  He tells a hell of a story.  Amazing.  I mean, he could be a little long-winded at times, but that doesn't mean that.  I was just reading his pop culture column in Entertainment Weekly, and supposedly his next book is going to be over 1,000 pages. 
[01:01:30]  Like, just a ridiculous amount of pages.  He is prolific.  This guy writes.  Amazing.  He never shortchanges the audience.  Ever.  Amazing.  Everyone knows he's a great writer.  I would strongly suggest you check out some of his pop culture stuff he writes about.  Very, very insightful.  Very good.  Who's better?  John Gresham, who tells the same story every time?  I got sucked into the, you know, for a while. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  I made it.  The third book is when I said, okay, this is just like the second.  Yeah.  And the first book.  I'm done with you.  Done.  You could just look at anything on YouTube.  There is not one thing that you cannot find on there.  It's amazing what people have uploaded.  Yeah, it's awesome.  Danny was just showing every good part of Creepshow.  We can continue after the break.  877-212-ON-A.  As we go to break, it's Black History Month as well.  A very busy show today.  Who do we honor today?  Well, we're going to find out right now. 
[01:02:30]  To celebrate Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is recognizing those historic  African Americans without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today.  Today, we honor Michael T. Williamson, who starred as Private Benjamin Buford Bubba Blue  in the 1994 Oscar-winning Forrest Gump.  I know everything they used to know about the shrimp and business.  This marble-mouthed idiot was blown in half by a landmine and missed out on the opportunity  to be the captain of a shrimp boat.  Then, Bubba said something I won't ever forget. 
[01:03:00]  I want to go home.  Good luck in the afterlife, stupid.  Stay tuned for more icons of Black History on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Intern David very upset.  Why, Anthony?  A little upset.  Well, yesterday, I was talking about the space above my fireplace, and it's a very large  space, and I don't know what to put there.  It's been the mystery of kind of finishing off the decor in my home. 
[01:03:30]  It goes up almost 20 feet.  It's very high.  There's a fireplace, and then there's the space from the mantle to the ceiling, which  is very big.  Yes.  And then from window to window, so it's pretty wide, too.  Yeah.  And I want something over that.  And it's just been a mystery as to what to put there.  So I took a picture of the space, and the listeners now are going to my Facebook, the ones that  are privileged enough to be one of the 5,000 members, friends. 
[01:04:00]  And they're photoshopping in what they believe I should have up there.  And someone has photoshopped something that would look very at home in Heinrich Himmler's  house.  Oh, boy.  Maybe Joseph Goebbels' house over there, fireplace.  Maybe at a Nuremberg rally.  And it is a very long banner-type red flag with the white circle and the swastika in the 
[01:04:30]  middle.  Because people, for some reason, believe I'm a Nazi.  Why would they think that?  Because I collect memorabilia from World War II.  I appreciate the era, that age of innocence that was taken from us by a world war.  Oh, a picture of Jimmy Norton's on the cover of his book.  Someone said that.  But David saw this over my shoulder and is very...  Not happy.  Not happy.  David, I understand how you would be very offended by this. 
[01:05:00]  I'm offended just looking at it.  You're offended.  It's in my house.  It looks like it's in my house.  Someone photoshopped it.  Did you see the one with Obama?  Oh, my God.  Someone put it in Obama?  Oh, yeah, they did.  Go back on.  It's very funny.  All right.  Let me see that one.  I thought you saw it already.  Nice big picture of Obama smiling.  All right.  Let's have a choice between these two.  In front of an American flag.  Boy, I wonder.  But, David, yeah, I know.  You saw that.  Yes, I saw that.  I apologize that you had to see such a thing because it is horrible. 
[01:05:30]  It is very horrible.  I didn't approve of that at all.  It's a symbol of hatred, a symbol of intolerance, and something I absolutely wish.  I'd never have hanging on my wall like that.  Not like that.  I'm glad.  You know, the other way, obviously, it has to be pointing clockwise.  What?  No, I'm teasing, of course.  No, I would never have that.  Good.  Yeah.  So don't fret.  You know, there was a scene in Step Brothers.  Yeah.  Where they want to piss off the neighbors, so Will Ferrell dresses up as a Nazi, but the 
[01:06:00]  symbol is...  Oh, it wasn't a swastika?  It was slightly off, but it was obviously supposed to be the swastika.  Yeah, I love when they do that one.  Anyone else see that?  People that don't want to go the distance.  I think it was facing the other way, or they just changed it slightly just to keep it safe  for everybody.  Yeah.  And they never want to go the distance.  No, of course not.  It is quite offensive to some people to, you know, just to throw that in there.  Some people get very offended, and they have a reason to when they see that symbol, so... 
[01:06:30]  You sent me the picture.  I sent it out to the Twitter people, so they're playing along, too, Anthony.  Oh, right.  You got the picture of the big, empty space, and the Twitter people are filling it up  with some fun stuff, too.  It is a big, empty space, and the other day, when Danny was hanging out, we heard some  people talking, and Ange, who does my decorating, Keith Coswife, was  talking about some things, and then I heard, like, tapestry.  Tapestry.  And I was like, oh, no.  Right to Danny, I went, no, no tapestry.  But it's your house. 
[01:07:00]  You don't whisper, no tapestry.  You tell them, no tapestry.  No tapestry.  Yeah, what's wrong with you?  They're taking over your house slowly.  I don't like tapestry.  I like, I want something big and classic.  A big picture of Keith and Ange.  No!  I want a big painting of something very classical up there.  It's also on onaradio.com.  So you go there right now, you can see the empty space in Anthony's house, and you can  fill it up with whatever you think he would like there.  Okay?  Play along. 
[01:07:30]  Play along, yes.  Very interactive here.  Is that Photoshop, Danny?  Yeah.  It's so easy, isn't it?  It's just amazing what they can do.  All right, David, beat it.  Bye, David.  Scram.  But you didn't go for that picture, did you, David?  No, I didn't.  He came up behind me, he looked, and he just went, oh, no!  Oh, no!  Yeah.  He's freaking out.  Like, you're not getting an invite over the house.  You're not.  Let's see how calm Sully was as he was landing in the river.  I want to hear this.  I haven't heard it yet.  You really haven't heard it yet?  No.  It's pretty impressive, man. 
[01:08:00]  What happened?  Sully.  Yeah, what did he do?  Yeah, you got the flight recorder tapes finally coming out.  And let's get right to it.  Sully wants to return to LaGuardia, then realizes he's not going to make it.  This is how it sounded.  This is Cactus 1539.  It burns through.  Lost to us.  I'm hoping it's returning back towards LaGuardia.  Okay.  You need to return to LaGuardia.  Turn left heading up 220.  220.  Stop your departure.  It's got emergency returning.  Cactus 1529. 
[01:08:30]  We can get it to you.  Do you want to try to land 101-3?  We're unable.  We may end up in the Hudson.  My tactic is 1549.  It's going to be left traffic to runway 31.  Unable.  Unable.  All right, listen to me.  Oh, that is creepy that he's that calm.  I'm sorry.  It's great that he is, but that's creepy.  That is creepy.  He's just being, ah!  Yeah.  Ah!  Yeah.  Because, all right, we're not going to make it.  Unable.  Unable.  That was the last word right there?  No, we got another track. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, I was going to say.  Stop it for a second.  Yumping Yemeni.  I did see, I don't know, God bless you, somebody sent me a link to Last Word Said By Pilots.  Did we talk about that on the show?  Oh, it's horrid.  Did we talk about that on the show?  Yeah, we did a little of that.  Last Word Said By The Pilots.  Oh, maybe we did do that.  Okay.  Maybe I heard it here on the show.  Yeah, those are pretty tragic.  What kind of training do they give you to have you stay that calm?  Uh, I think it's your, what you did up until then.  I think if he was a newbie, he'd be freaking out. 
[01:09:30]  You'd hear, ah!  But, uh...  He knows he's going into the Hudson River.  He knows that...  He flew an F-4 Phantom.  The guy is a former fighter pilot.  But he knows the temperature.  The water is barely above freezing.  All this crap.  And he's like, ah!  I think we're going to go to the Hudson.  Meh!  I'll tell you one thing, though.  That's why these guys are good.  Because they're already flying.  Like, their thing is, they take a piece of machinery, and they bring it to 30,000 feet,  and they zip across.  It's like they're already doing something which horrifies all of us conceptually. 
[01:10:00]  So when they have a problem up there, it's just a problem which can be deadly, but it's  like one of us having a problem with our car.  Like, it's like, you know you could die, but you'd probably think, like, all right, let  me check this, let me try that.  Right.  I mean, they have a long way to fall before the wheels come off.  And I'm starting to think all these pilots know that they have an option with that Hudson  River.  Just how they talk about, ah, we're going to end up in the river.  Yeah, they probably, a lot of them taking off from LaGuardia.  Go, look, here is an option.  All right, one of the options is the river.  You know.  If you have to.  Not everyone's going to survive, but you know what? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  You could save yourself and some people.  At least you're not going into buildings on either side.  There's nowhere else to really go.  But he said, we're going to end up in the river.  Like, this is part of what they just understand as pilots.  And they end up in the Hudson.  Here's the second track.  They try to find another spot for Sully.  He chooses the Hudson.  Okay, what do you need to land?  Guide to 15.9.  Runway 4 is available if you want to make left track to runway 4.  AD, I'm not sure we're going to make any runway.  Watch over to our right.  Anything in New Jersey? 
[01:11:00]  Maybe Teterboro.  Okay, yeah.  Off your right side is Teterboro Airport.  Do you want to try to go to Teterboro?  Yes.  Teterboro Empire.  Actually, LaGuardia Departure guy.  Emergency inbound.  Guide to 15.29.  Turn right to 8.0.  You can land runway 1 at Teterboro.  We can't do it.  Okay, which runway would you like at Teterboro?  We're going to be in the Hudson.  Cactus 15.9.  Radar contact is lost.  You also got Newark Airport up at 2 o'clock and about 7 miles.  2-1-0.  I think he said he was going to the Hudson. 
[01:11:30]  I think he said he was going to the Hudson.  Yeah, he's 15.9.  He's on.  They're just off the radar at that point.  He had to stop yapping and start flying.  Dude, I got chills.  He goes, we're going to the Hudson.  Can't make it.  Can't do it.  So did he turn off the transmission?  I guess he just, you know.  Stop talking.  It's time to land the plane.  Either that or, you know, he had to be talking to.  That's just the, that seems to be just the radio communication between the tower and the plane. 
[01:12:00]  What about the cockpit voice recorder between him and the co-pilot?  That'll come out in 10 years.  That's the stuff I want to hear, like, right when they're going in.  I want to hear the...  Because they have to be, him and the co-pilot had to be calling off stuff between each other when they were doing that.  And I'd like to hear how calm they were during all that.  Yeah, but he's so calm right there.  That's creepy to me.  It's one of those things like when, you know, for some reason you have more time when you're crashing a plane. 
[01:12:30]  And you do a car.  But when you're in, like, a skid, like, stuff like that, you're not going, ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!  You're kind of dealing with it.  And then when you're done, you freak out.  You know, you start thinking about what could have happened and things like that.  And that's when you kind of, you know, your legs get weak.  But I think during these crisis moments, it's not in his head like, oh, my God, imminent death.  And I have heard some of the voice recordings when the pilots know they're dead.  They know it's over. 
[01:13:00]  And you do hear, like, a scream.  Or like, oh, my God!  Something, right?  Or they curse.  Snap off, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Then they know.  Like, Sully was just like, all right, I'm going to have to land this in the river.  I'll scream later if we're, you know, cartwheeling in flames.  I feel like an ass.  Why?  Ah, you know.  City player goes bad and I'm screaming bloody hell.  I think I can learn something from Sully today and just be like, ah, stunt brain.  Malfunction in CD1. 
[01:13:30]  Can you get a new one?  I don't think we're going to be able to play that clip.  Right.  Would you like to go to the other clip that we have on standby?  Right.  Not going to be able to make it.  But what do I do?  I scream like a little girl and I kick things.  That's great.  That's what Sully just got up out of his seat and started kicking the instruments.  Yeah.  Damn, birds!  Right.  Now you fixed it.  Now, go ahead.  You fixed it.  I don't feel too good about myself right now.  You want to hear the second track again?  It's worth playing.  Yeah, that is a good one.  It's just so creepy. 
[01:14:00]  Okay, what do you need to land?  Guys, it's 15.9.  Runway 4 is available if you want to make left traffic to Runway 4.  I'm not sure we can make any runway.  What's over to our right?  Anything in New Jersey?  Maybe Teterboro.  Okay, yeah.  Off your right side is Teterboro Airport.  Do you want to try to go to Teterboro?  Yes.  Teterboro Empire.  Actually, LaGuardia Departure got emergency inbound.  Cactus 1529, turn right 280.  You can land runway 1 at Teterboro.  We can't do it.  Okay, which runway would you like at Teterboro?  We're going to get to Hudson. 
[01:14:30]  Cactus 15.9, radar contact is lost.  You also got Newark Airport up at 2 o'clock and about 7 miles.  210-4718.  I think he said he was going in the Hudson.  Cactus 15.9, Houston.  You can hear the panic in the other guy.  Yeah, yeah.  He's not flying the plane.  Because it's all up to him to figure out a spot for this guy.  Yeah, where do you want to go?  Where do you want to go?  Where do you want to go?  Help me out here.  Going to the Hudson.  Going to the Hudson.  I'll tell you, there's amazing, amazing audio of the United plane where we've talked about 
[01:15:00]  before, the DC-10.  Oh, yeah.  Where they had that freak explosion of 30,000 feet and they lost all ability to control the  aircraft.  All hydrolics, yeah.  And when you hear that communication, he's like, yeah, we've lost all, I think, all rudder  control or all elevator control.  And when you hear these guys at 30,000 feet who cannot control the aircraft, they're talking  exactly that comment.  It's amazing, these guys.  Let's go to Tim.  He's a retired military guy.  Tim, what do you got on this?  Anything to add? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, I sure do.  I just retired after 22 years.  Granted, it was the Coast Guard, but I did search and rescue in Alaska for four years.  And I talked a pilot in once.  We picked three people up out of the water.  Couldn't get the fourth one.  We ended up dropping him.  And the pilot had to fly in and there was basically no fuel.  And I talked him in and the pilot was the same way.  As his fuel level's gone down, he's just calm, calm, calm.  And I'm just like, oh, my God, he's not going to make it.  And then same thing. 
[01:16:00]  As soon as he got over the runway, he's like, hey, thanks for talking me in.  And off he went.  You know?  It's just that's the way we train.  You can't panic in those situations.  Otherwise, it's useless.  Yep.  You guys are amazing.  I just can't even imagine.  Thank you, Tim.  We got Victor from Baltimore.  He's an airline pilot, has info on takeoff preparations.  Victor.  Hey, good morning, guys.  How you doing?  Dude, so when you're taking off out of the New York area,  do you understand that the Hudson River is an option if you have a problem? 
[01:16:30]  We know it's an option, but we don't discuss it.  We actually talk about what's going to happen at 80 knots.  If we have any engine fire, warning, or failure, we'll abort the takeoff.  Anything from 80 knots to what we call V1, which is where an engine would cut out,  and you would basically be forced to fly, we briefed that we'll go to either JFK or Newark, New Jersey.  Sure.  And if we're on fire, we'll figure we'll do what we can to go to the closest airport. 
[01:17:00]  Or Flushing Bay.  Oof.  Yeah.  The other thing I wanted to add was, believe it or not, and I hate to throw a wrench in this whole deal,  that is not actually Sully talking.  What happened was, when they took off on the departure, when they make their left turn,  they make a right turn towards Shea Stadium, and then you make a left turn just about three miles from the airport.  That's when the aircraft ingested birds. 
[01:17:30]  Well, as soon as both engines rolled back tower, the first officer said,  your aircraft, to Captain Sully.  And at that point, the first officer took over communications on the radio.  So we're hearing the co-pilot.  Say it again?  We just heard the co-pilot.  Right.  The co-pilot is Jeff.  I don't know his last name.  The captain was Sully, but Sully was flying it, and the first officer, the co-pilot, would have been Jeff.  And Jeff's the one talking.  Stupid us.  I just assumed that was Sully. 
[01:18:00]  But Sully was a little busy.  No, no.  You guys are doing a great job of actually discussing of what's going on.  But most people don't understand that when one pilot is flying, the other pilot is doing the radio communications.  Gotcha.  I only know it from the movie Airplane, which Peter Graves would fly and talk, so I assumed, and try to touch young boys.  Right.  You know, Shirley, you can't be serious.  Don't go be Shirley.  And the other thing is, you hear communications between the parts of the car. 
[01:18:30]  Can I let the tower ever talk?  What's that, sir?  I know it's lonely up there in the air, but give someone a chance to talk.  Let me ask, Mr. Pyle, let me ask you a question.  The Concorde, we've all seen the footage of the Concorde, it caught fire as it took off.  I mean, because that little part got kicked up into the engine, and the engine blew.  And once you're too far, like, stopping is just not an option?  I mean, I know that's a stupid question, but...  No, it's actually not a stupid question.  Once we reach a certain speed, which we call V1 or takeoff decision speed, anything that happens, you take it in the air, because you're not going to have the room to stop. 
[01:19:00]  It's actually more dangerous to try to stop than to actually take it in the air.  So they just make the runway longer and put sand there.  They do.  Well, that's the problem with LaGuardia.  When we hit LaGuardia, before V1, you're well past halfway down the runway, and anything that happens, you're either going swimming or you're going in the air.  They extended that part of that runway, but it's still one of the shortest goddamn runways for the size planes that they're putting in and out of that place. 
[01:19:30]  We had a plane land in that water on takeoff, wasn't it?  Yeah, it went into Flushing Bay.  Yeah, that's a while ago.  I'm sorry, gentlemen.  I didn't mean to talk earlier.  It's very similar to D.C.  D.C. and LaGuardia are two of the shortest airports that I've operated out of.  Now, they've got some great technology for the end of the runways these days where they put down a certain type of material.  I'm not sure what it is, but if you roll off the end of the runway, it will slow you right down, stop you pretty quickly. 
[01:20:00]  Yes, sir.  Your aircraft will sink into the, it almost looks like concrete, but when you go off of it, the weight of the aircraft sinks into it, and it stops you pretty quick.  It turns into like sand almost.  Oh, what a great idea, man.  Is it glue?  How did they put glue on the end of the runway?  Flypaper.  All right, gentlemen, punch it out.  All right.  All right.  Oh, punch out.  A bunch of fans going the other way and just blow you back. 
[01:20:30]  I like to hear the good stuff that's happening to keep us safer.  All right.  I never knew that.  That'll make it a little easier to fly.  CNN's saying that's Sully.  So where are we at with this?  Was that Sully or the co-pilot?  What's going on?  All right.  Maybe they're wrong.  I would, you know something?  I don't believe the news.  No.  I would believe this guy first.  I gave up on that years ago.  Yep.  Let's go to the FU line and we'll continue.  Eh, just stick around.  We've got something good.  I just don't know what it is yet.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line. 
[01:21:00]  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have eight new voice messages.  First voice message.  Hey, this is a big fuck you.  To all the Arizona Cardinal fans, thank you for allowing the Pittsburgh Steelers to win their sixth Super Bowl.  Fuck you.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to send a big fuck you to President Obama and Nazi Pelosi for passing that stupid trillion dollar stimulus plan.  Go fuck yourselves, you fucking retards. 
[01:21:30]  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big FU to those jerk-offs that robbed my apartment and thought that they were going to bring me down.  I know who you are.  Have to feel, wear my dirty underwear.  Next message.  I'd like to give a big FU to the guy that calls up our certain regular rock station in New York and asks for a song that we've heard 10 million times.  Hey, stupid, don't pick Under the Bridge by Red House. 
[01:22:00]  What do you like a back rub, Anthony?  It did such a great job on my live reads.  Here's a back rub.  It is very, uh, it is a very nice treat.  Yeah.  The old back rub.  And it's getting a little back rub.  They're checking that out on, uh, Pal Talk.  Of course, they always do.  They're like, who's that?  Who's that?  She's, uh, much hotter than her voice.  Her voice stinks. 
[01:22:30]  Unless you're singing.  A lot of compliments when you, uh, sang that song at my wedding.  But, man, your speaking voice is horrendous.  Thank God you're hot.  877-212-ON-A.  Lisa and I danced at your wedding a little bit because I didn't have a date.  Really?  Dirty danced?  No, we didn't.  But you don't like to dirty dance with me, Jimmy.  It was actually very nice and very respectful.  Yeah.  Oh, just gentle, Lisa.  I'm very sore.  But, shoot, there was no, uh, I tried to get some vibes. 
[01:23:00]  I got none.  Really?  I was annoyed, yeah.  I tried to do the old hand on the hip thing and she gave me nothing back.  Nothing?  Nothing.  Patrice gave me sexier vibes.  Now Jimmy's got a nice little megrim.  I am in agony because of the last guy I was with sent me flowers.  Maybe they thought she was dead.  Saturday night, thank you.  All right, now people are saying that, uh, that was Sully. 
[01:23:30]  The FAA says it's Sully, not enough time to hand over the old communications to the co-pilot.  So I think we got to the bottom of that little mystery.  Right.  All right.  Um, should we go with the dentist audio, Danny?  People think it's great.  Uh-oh.  With the kid?  Uh-oh.  Yeah, you know, I saw this.  Let's give it a try.  I didn't think it was all that much of anything, but it's everywhere.  It is everywhere and people think it's really funny.  So is Pink Panther 2.  That's a damn funny thing. 
[01:24:00]  Fly, but I can fly.  Can fly.  Hey, Jimmy, wait a minute.  Hold on.  You can't just do Pink Panther stuff without, um, giving me a chance to pump it up here.  Oh, you got to punch it up?  Yeah.  A little bit?  Remember that review about the trombones?  We have the music.  Trombones always equal funny.  Yeah.  Well, that's what we learned in one of the, uh, reviews.  Pink Panther getting 5% positive reviews on, uh, Rotten Tomatoes.  That's calm.  All right.  What was that line again, Jimmy? 
[01:24:30]  Um, we actually had the Pink Panther music because that would just really punch it up.  But it was, uh, would you, uh, like to fly, um, there's something about them flying.  Fly to Europe?  Yeah.  Uh, are you flying to Europe?  But I can't fly.  Now it's funny.  Where's that review?  Because somebody, I would like to order an Amber girl. 
[01:25:00]  It is funny.  Uh, how ironic.  I stole from Peter's cereals and then someone stole my funny burn.  That was a brilliant review.  What was that, Wall Street Journal or the Times? 
[01:25:30]  Journal.  Wall Street Journal, uh, pointing out that in this new Pink Panther movie, they used a trombone to really jack up some of the, the bits and the lines.  Because, uh, the comedy equals funny.  Sure, that's what we're going to say.  You got one more?  Because I got a fourth track.  Oh.  Might as well play all of them.  Another track?  Mm-hmm.  Um, I don't know.  Oh.  I have on a little hat.  You got to say it.  Look.  I have on a little hat. 
[01:26:00]  I am driving.  Oh, I've let go of their stealing wheel.  Uh, somebody put a white toilet seat cover on my head.  Stupid Pink Panther.  Where is Peter Sellers' mummified colon? 
[01:26:30]  I would like to penetrate it.  Of course, that won't get through to this side, but...  Oh, whatever.  Pretty good.  That word.  Whoa!  All right, let's, uh, move on.  So, yeah.  That's a wonderful movie for all of us to check out this weekend, I'm sure.  Yeah.  Uh, The Dentist.  That's where we're at.  So the dad, uh, videotapes his kid and laughs at how doped up he is after the dentist trip.  Why is Sam here?  Do you have a Dilbert update? 
[01:27:00]  Is that why you're here?  Dilbert?  What do you got, Sam?  I just was here in case you had any questions about this audio.  Do you like it or nah?  Yeah, yeah.  You kind of like it?  Yeah, it's not bad.  All right.  So you got the dad videotaping his son.  Here we go.  How did it go?  I didn't feel anything.  Oh, God.  I'm in.  This is funny.  The little kid is, uh, all left up?  Yeah, there's a couple of really good little kid lines in it.  How old is, uh, the kid?  He's probably like eight.  Seven. 
[01:27:30]  And, and what did he, oh, Uncle Paul.  And, and he, oh, Dr. Paul.  What, uh, what did he have, what was he given?  Like, what kind of drugs?  I don't know.  It was, I think that he was under for, uh, for getting his tooth out or something because  he had stitches in his gums.  Yeah.  So they must have knocked him out with whatever.  Yeah, maybe they gave him some of that, uh, Valium or something.  Valium and doped him up.  And then put him through some of that, uh, gas, that nitrous oxide.  Yeah.  Is there, is there outrage? 
[01:28:00]  No, there's remixes, but not outrage.  Oh, let's get some of the remixes.  Oh, that's good.  Look at the kid.  Oh, the video's even better.  He's adorable.  Onaradio.com will link that video.  Okay, good.  How did it go?  I didn't feel anything.  Yeah.  Uh, I feel so good.  Kind of felt good, didn't it?  Uh, it's just real life.  Yeah, it's just real life. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, this kid rolls.  Oh, soap in there, you little bastard.  So been there, you're never not there.  Is this real life?  This is a kid effed up.  Yes.  That's what they think.  Is this real life?  I feel funny.  Why do we, why do we give little kids stuff like that?  It's just a preview for what you could do when you get older.  Dude, this would be, if I had a kid.  Yeah.  If I was ever, uh, uh, cursed with a child, I would have him drugged up all the time. 
[01:29:00]  Cause this is hysterical.  Oh.  Uh, is this real life?  Yeah, this is real life.  Okay, now, I have two fingers.  Good.  I have four fingers.  Oh.  Let's find him more fingers as he goes.  He has a little tooth missing.  Yeah.  Apparently the lad had to have an extraction.  Yes, he did. 
[01:29:30]  Wow.  He's hysterical.  Is this real life?  It gets better.  Yes.  This next track is amazing.  You feel good?  I can't see anything.  Yes, you can.  Stay in your seat.  Oh, yeah.  I think I've drank with this kid.  The video's amazing. 
[01:30:00]  And then he just falls back in his seat after that scream.  He sits way up and just starts screaming.  Lee's forward.  This is hysterical.  Oh, wow.  You feel good?  I can't see anything.  Yes, you can.  Stay in your seat.  I don't feel tired.  You don't?  Uh-uh. 
[01:30:30]  Draw stitches.  Uh-huh.  Why can't I touch it?  Because it'll mess up the stitches.  You have four eyes.  Yeah.  You have four eyes.  I feel funny.  Why is this happening to me?  It's okay, bud.  It's just from the medicine.  Okay?  Is this going to be forever?  What was the last line? 
[01:31:00]  Is this going to be forever?  He thought he was going to be all effed up for the rest of his life.  But he's probably hoping that the father says yes.  Yes.  Right on.  This is too goddamn funny.  What a cute boy.  Oh, he's all effed up.  He's going to start a new trend.  You know, there's other fathers out there a little jealous going, oh, I'll get my bastard.  Is this going to be forever?  All fucked up on film.  It's just, you don't hear these questions out of your adult drug addict friends.  They're the innocent little kid questions of how effed up he is. 
[01:31:30]  How is this going to last forever?  How is this kid going to avoid like pod and alcohol and pills when he gets older?  Well, when he gets older.  I think, you know, you've got to throw a little agent.  But how do you tell him it's a bad thing?  Yeah.  He's loving it.  He starts writing song parodies with his brother.  And the next thing you know.  The next thing you know, it does last forever.  It's just from the medicine.  Okay. 
[01:32:00]  It's just going to last forever.  Plus, he's famous now for being high.  Yeah.  When he gets older, he's old.  Hey, it's the high kid.  YouTube kid who's high.  You're the high kid from YouTube.  Yeah.  Give me some heroin.  Why is this happening to me?  It's okay, bud.  It's just from the medicine.  Okay?  Is this going to be forever?  No.  No, it won't be forever. 
[01:32:30]  Ugh.  Just laughing at him.  Laughing and videotaping him.  That rolls.  What a scream.  That's funny, man.  How many views has that gotten?  It's gotten almost 4 million.  Holy crap.  Look at that.  When was it posted?  This video just hit probably earlier in the week.  Yes.  That is what you call your viral video, man.  That's a touchdown right there.  That's a biggie.  It's pushing 4 million.  You've got everything that makes a great video.  The cute little kid, drug addiction. 
[01:33:00]  Yes.  When I saw this video, I pulled the audio on a version where the description was in Spanish  and it had Spanish subtitles on it.  Oh, really?  Yes.  It's worldwide.  Worldwide.  It's a phenomenon.  That is really good.  Absolutely.  You know what?  You could probably just chalk it up to way over 4 million.  Some seeing in the related videos.  There's at least 3 or 4 other reposts of this video in a different form. 
[01:33:30]  Right.  Yeah.  It's like of the top viewed YouTube videos, it's like 6 of them.  Phew.  Wow.  Yeah.  Guy hit a home run with that one.  I love the scream.  This is going to be forever.  And then he just screams for no reason.  What a little maniac.  That kid, you know what?  That kid's a punk.  And he knows what he's doing.  And it would be great if they arrested him.  They want to give Michael Phelps a hard time.  How about this little junkie?  That's the little kid.  Say hi to Jerry in Indiana. 
[01:34:00]  Jerry.  Yeah, the kid should be on Rock Scream Tuesday.  Sing it like it.  Yeah, a little Rock Scream happened there.  Did have a good scream.  We got some really big news coming in from Richie.  Richie, why don't you tell everybody?  Hey, Richie, what's up, man?  Hello?  You're on the air.  We'd like to talk to you.  Richie with the big news.  You're on the air.  Richie?  Yes, you.  Yes, you.  You got big news, Richie?  Yeah, I got big news.  All right. 
[01:34:30]  Dummy.  Now we don't know what the big news is.  I don't know.  Richie stunk.  I can't tell you.  I want to know what it was.  Oh, I am sure there's a lot of people out there yelling at their radios.  They all need to know the big news.  It's the big news.  You just tell us.  Nope.  Yeah, it's a secret.  Nope.  We just whisper into the microphone.  I'll hear it through my headphones.  Go ahead.  All right.  Uh-huh.  Really?  You know?  Yeah, I hear it.  I just hope he's whispering. 
[01:35:00]  All right.  Why don't you tell Sam?  Really?  This is real mature.  It's fun.  Why don't we move right into this 911 audio there, Danny.  I didn't hear this one.  This is a man who continues dealing drugs while he's on the phone with 911.  Yeah, apparently he was, I guess there were some guys after him, some rival dealers or what  have you.  So he calls 911 saying that there's guys after me. 
[01:35:30]  And then he ends up on the phone with 911 as he's dealing with heroin.  What a guy.  What an idiot.  All right.  Let me guess in my head.  Let me just guess.  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Okay.  I got it in my head.  Now play the audio and let me see if I'm right.  You got what?  Nothing.  Nothing.  I'm just saying, let me see if I'm right.  What do you got, you think?  What do you think?  I just thought of something and I want to see if I'm right.  He's guessing Eskimo.  No, I'm not.  It's nothing about that. 
[01:36:00]  Do you have a concept as to what this gentleman may look like?  Why would you even say something like that when all I said is, let me guess.  All right.  I got it.  Go.  Let me see if I'm right.  I'm only curious.  It could be what type of drugs he's selling.  Do the bed.  Exactly.  Do the bed.  Do you have a guess as to what he may look like?  I don't know.  No, I didn't even think of that.  I don't see color.  Attaboy.  You don't need a college degree to deal drugs.  Some street smarts, however, would help.  A 911 caller looking for... 
[01:36:30]  Why do we have to deal with the news bad?  Yeah, I don't have to deal with...  Puker.  You goddamn puker.  Talk.  You're a human, and humans are watching you.  I'm special.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  This shows my talent.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I'm so talented.  No one else can talk like this.  This might be more important.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  If everyone could talk like this, I'd be out of a job. 
[01:37:00]  All right, Richie's back with the big news.  Now, Richie, you're prepared to give everybody the big news, right?  I sure am, my friend.  What's up, Richie?  Oh, come now.  Big news.  I want to hear it.  Richie's got big news.  Let's get back to this.  911 caller looking for help says some guys with guns are out to get them.  Do people look in your apartment, and that's got you worried?  Yeah, they got guns.  You saw guns in their hands?  Yeah. 
[01:37:30]  You actually saw guns in your hands?  Yeah, just come home, man.  How many are out there?  There was two.  I don't know what the other one was.  Two males outside with guns?  Yeah.  All right.  What do they look like?  Look, I'm going to hang up with this thing.  You're not serious.  You're lying, and the police are going to charge you.  At this point, the guy hung up the phone, but the 911 operator had his number, so she  called him back.  And what she heard next, that's enough to add a whole new wing to the dumb criminal hall 
[01:38:00]  of fame.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, ho, ho.  I've never been there.  What state is that in?  I don't know.  But why would they have to add a wing for one guy?  Just one guy.  A whole new wing.  For the dumb criminal hall of fame.  Sure.  And an existing wing.  You know.  They have to build a whole wing for one guy?  One guy.  Because he did one dumb thing?  Yeah.  How about they build a new wing for Hack Reporter Voice Hall of Fame?  It's just for you, pally.  Does it have the shotgun that the guy put on the counter while he was taking the money 
[01:38:30]  and then the clerk grabbed it from him?  Is that hanging up on a wall in the dumb criminal hall of fame?  I'd rather go to that than the stupid rock and roll hall of fame.  I hate that place.  I've never been there, but I know it's just trash.  Go to a hard rock.  At least you get a burger.  To the dumb criminal hall of fame.  I'm going to get all the food stuff.  Hold on one second.  What do you need to do with that?  Can you test that?  Good call.  Good call. 
[01:39:00]  All right.  Go on.  We'll do it.  Go on.  Ready?  Good call.  Good call.  25.  Good call.  Good call.  He's in front of the pickpock.  Do you want me to do it?  Hi.  What do you need, man?  Yo, man.  What do you need?  Are you kidding me?  He's selling right there on the phone.  Yeah, hold on a minute.  Oh, Richie's back with the big news.  Richie, you've got big news for everybody.  What's going on with you?  Well, I am an arcade owner in New Jersey, and we're having a big King of Kong contest at 
[01:39:30]  our arcade right in Flemington, New Jersey, and you guys love the King of Kong, I hear.  Yes, we do.  Yes, we do.  I was actually on NBC, the Today Show.  Well, who gives a turkey?  You do.  I know.  All right.  Smoking a minute.  Richie Knuckles Arcade, richieknuckles.com.  We were going to have people from King of Kong at our place playing Donkey Kong, all those  kind of things.  Who?  Who?  The only reason I...  Who's going to be there? 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, the only reason I took your call, who's going to be there?  Who?  Okay.  This is the big news.  If you guys follow the King of Kong, there was a guy named Tim Zerbe, who actually had  the world record, not Billy Mitchell, beforehand.  The movie is so fabricated.  This guy, Tim Zerbe, had the world record.  Oh, my God.  Steve Weeby came in and beat his world record.  Billy Mitchell, is Steve Weeby going to be there?  Steve Weeby is definitely a possibility.  Oh, God.  What is definitely a possibility?  Danny's disgusted with you. 
[01:40:30]  I was so excited on my day.  I know.  I was going to be there.  I know this is going to be obscure for most of our audience.  Is Billy Mitchell going to be there?  Yes.  That is the big news.  I met Billy Mitchell on the Today Show, and when I called...  I have his home phone number.  I have not called him yet because of this guy, Tim Zerbe, coming in to play Donkey Kong  on our show.  All right.  What about Brian Koo?  Yeah.  What was Brian Koo in line again?  Hold on.  Hold on.  And all of Twin Galaxies will be there to record these tapes.  Okay.  Here we go, dude.  This is something you can do for us as a fan of this very program. 
[01:41:00]  Yes.  We put you on hold.  You then give Travis or whoever the hell is on the phone Steve Weeby's phone number.  I have Steve Weeby's phone number.  Billy Mitchell.  Billy Mitchell.  Then give him Billy Mitchell's phone number so we can call him up and talk about this  event.  And we'll plug whatever you want to plug.  Yeah.  We're big fans of Billy Mitchell.  But we want to talk to Billy Mitchell.  Absolutely.  We'll give you Billy Mitchell's phone number.  Okay.  Please hold.  No.  Hold on.  No.  You hold on. 
[01:41:30]  You hold.  Since that guy brought King of Kong up, I just have to mention I was looking at the  IMDB for the King of Kong and in the message board section where you can post things,  someone started writing Brian haikus in relation to Brian Koo from the movie.  Yeah.  And I thought the concept was so funny, I brought it over to the message board.  Brian haiku.  Yeah.  There's a few pages of Brian haikus that were really funny.  You know what?  For the people out there looking for a good flick, this King of Kong.  And you've got to watch it more than one.  Yeah.  You pick up on...  There's so many different angles going on. 
[01:42:00]  Like, I try to explain it all the time and I'm like, dude, you've got to watch this documentary.  Because then you feel like an idiot trying to describe it to your friends.  Of course you do.  You're like, oh, what's it about?  And you're like, it's about this guy who's going for the Donkey Kong World Record.  And everybody's just like, why would I watch it?  What?  Why would...  Yeah.  Because it's so ridiculous.  It's so ridiculous.  Give me a little Billy Mitchell, will you?  What's one of your favorite lines from the movie?  Well, me and Sam are always making fun of the scene where he's explaining what his initials were on the old school games.  Yeah.  And he's always wearing some patriotic ties, so he's got that American flag tie. 
[01:42:30]  So he's asking the camera crew, he's like, well, what do you think it was?  As he's playing with this tie, almost like a la David Brent, he just keeps fiddling with it.  So the guy goes, flag?  He goes, if you don't know, you're not looking hard enough.  And he just keeps fiddling with it.  Oh, douche.  He dresses like the biggest douche.  Which one was I wearing yesterday?  And he's like referencing like the Statue of Liberty tie.  Yeah.  So he says, and then he explains to the camera that he would put in as his initials, USA. 
[01:43:00]  USA.  So that he could keep America on top.  Yeah.  The best.  Thank you, Billy.  The best thank you.  He did it for all of us.  Yes, he did.  He sacrificed.  He could have put his initials up there and people would have known it was him.  Sure.  But he put USA for all of us.  That's right.  We all win.  Did you talk to Billy Mitchell on the Sam and Dave show?  Yes.  You bastard.  How did you actually get Billy Mitchell for that piece of crap show?  Really?  First of all, that's not a good.  He's avoiding us, but he talks to you guys?  It's not a good description of the show. 
[01:43:30]  Piece of crap.  But.  I'd use the other word, but we're not on show.  Exactly.  Hunk of.  Yeah.  You had to keep it clean.  I'm sorry.  Eastside Dave drunk dialed his phone number that's on his website to get some hot sauce.  It's just a 1-800 number.  Uh-huh.  And he's like, yeah, I want to order like three cases of your hot sauce, blah, blah, blah.  I guess Billy Mitchell loves his business because Billy Mitchell called Eastside Dave back with  his cell phone and said, yeah, I'm just calling her about the message you left about the order.  And Dave, is this Billy Mitchell? 
[01:44:00]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  He saved the phone number.  And then the day we were taping a show, Dave goes, hey, should we talk to Billy Mitchell  today?  And I was like, yes.  How?  Yes.  And he's like, all right, let me call him.  And he said, he said, well, we had to call him like four times.  He's like, no, I don't want to do it then.  I don't want to do it then.  All right, I'll do it now.  We had to wait till like 4.30 in the afternoon to do it.  And then we were asking him about coming in.  And he was like, the only way I'll come in is if I get four plane tickets for the family.  Hotel, hotel room. 
[01:44:30]  Are you kidding me?  Really?  He says this?  He's a dude.  What does he think?  But the best line in that movie is when they're at like a restaurant and he opens a fortune  cookie and he reads the fortune and he smiles and looks around and he, did someone know  I was going to be here?  Did somebody plant this?  And the camera guy goes, what does it say?  And he goes, you strive for perfection.  It's me.  Have you seen this movie yet, Jimmy?  I have, yeah. 
[01:45:00]  People are like, what about Chasing Ghosts?  Not as good.  Not as good.  Chasing Ghosts was good.  It was a good documentary.  But there was no like heart or storyline.  Right.  You know, like King of Kong.  Billy Mitchell also claims that King of Kong is full of lies.  All lies.  Of course it is.  And then his little helper there.  Well, he had a bunch of them, but Brian Coo is like, well, he's the best.  Biggest loser ever.  Just on the phone with Billy, yeah, Steve hit 800,000.  He's still got one man left, so he's having a pretty good run. 
[01:45:30]  My favorite character in the whole thing, the more I watch it, my favorite guy is Mirzak,  the guy who has to watch all the tapes.  And, you know, he's like sitting on the floor of his parents' house with his stupid cats.  And he's like, you know, somebody has to sit and watch all these tapes.  He goes, you know, I have to watch, you know, when, you know, he's named somebody's name.  When I watch Bobby Jones have a two-day Nibbler performance, I've got to make sure that, you know,  he's doing everything right.  Yeah, to help this along a little bit, this guy, his whole job, when you're setting a world record with a video game, 
[01:46:00]  you're taping yourself, and then you send it to this dork in Jersey.  And he's in his parents' house or something with videotapes piled up to the ceiling.  And he has to watch all of these.  And he has to watch every second.  He can't, like, fast forward.  So if a guy's playing a game for two straight days, he has to watch that tape now.  And if you've never seen this movie, he's exactly what you're picturing in your head.  Like, I think when you're introduced to him on film for the first time,  he's got giant, huge Coke bottle glasses, and he's wearing, like, some kind of Total Recall, like, video release shirt. 
[01:46:30]  He's terrible.  And he also has one of my favorite lines in the film when he's talking about how hard Tron is at the beginning.  And he goes, if you don't know the next light sequence, if you don't know the next pattern, the Tron light sequence, you will lose your life.  It's like it's the most serious thing that could ever happen in the world is you not knowing that next Tron light cycle pattern.  The Billy Mitchell line when they're going over, you know, so what's your philosophy and everything, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:47:00]  And, like, one of the ways he sells himself is he picks up his cell phone and he goes, see my phone?  It says never surrender.  And now when I lock my phone, when you go to unlock it, it does say never surrender.  Oh, really?  Well, it has to.  Very good.  He's a hero.  And let's not forget about the mullet the guy wears.  It's the best thing ever.  It's wonderful, yeah.  It's also the hot sauce king.  Yeah.  And he's got the 80s beard.  He's just perfect.  All right, getting back to the 911 guy selling drugs as he's on the phone with 911.  Second track and last track.  Police tell us a 10-pack is slang for heroin and business is business. 
[01:47:30]  Why let a 911 call?  Get in the way of your drug deal.  Police with the easiest drug arrest ever, but drugs in the area, no surprise to people who live here.  And it's always trouble around here.  But I think it really was dumb that the man, you know, it was really crazy, I guess.  Yeah.  Well, she really added a lot to the story.  That's crazy stuff. 
[01:48:00]  All right, we're going to break.  Grammys are Sunday.  Another Grammy Minute.  Ah.  I love these.  What are the Oscars?  Oscars are a couple weeks, I guess.  Do you know?  I think it's in February, right?  Late February?  Late February.  The Oscars?  Okay.  Grammy Minute time.  It's an Opie and Anthony Grammy Minute.  Record of the year.  Leona Lewis.  Bleeding love.  But I don't care what they say.  I'm in love with you. 
[01:48:30]  They try to pull me away.  But they don't know the truth.  My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing.  You cut me open and I keep bleeding.  I keep, keep bleeding love.  I keep bleeding.  I keep, keep bleeding love.  Keep bleeding.  I keep, keep bleeding love.  You cut me open.  You cut me open. 
[01:49:00]  Expand your Grammy knowledge base  With Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  Let's not forget Jim Norton at Caroline's all weekend long  Tickets available for Sunday and a few for tonight  212-757-4100  Personally, I'm not a fan of the geek culture  Yeah?  But this King of Kong movie  I just absolutely love  The boys pulled the Billy Mitchell clips 
[01:49:30]  I think it's worth doing  Because we're kind of on the Billy Mitchell thing today  How do we explain this movie?  It really is hard  Like I said, I try to describe it to my friends  On the outside, just a quick synopsis  It's people vying for the highest score on Donkey Kong  And they're 80s-era video game players  Yeah  That have not stopped their passion for this game 
[01:50:00]  Now that's the outside  It sounds kind of like  But there's a whole culture too  Just to add to that  Where people have bragging rights  Because they have the highest score on all those games from the 80s  Yeah, yeah  But Donkey Kong is the big get, I guess  Because someone has the Ms. Pac-Man record  And he walks around in this geek culture  And they're like, oh, but there he is  My point is, none of that matters  Okay  The synopsis I just gave is the synopsis for the film  But none of that matters  They are all such incredible douches 
[01:50:30]  And just self-centered idiots  Living their life based on something that happened 25, 30 years ago  And they're all basically still trying to live in this era  When like time, like video games were the biggest thing for, you know, in the early 80s  Right  Like it hadn't happened before  So Time Magazine did this photo shoot  You know, with all like the world record holders  And that was like 1984  And they're still trying to live up this  Yes 
[01:51:00]  This Time Magazine article  You know, that, you know, it's just way past their time  The key to the storyline is like this geek mafia is controlling this Donkey Kong story  Yes  They're protecting  And this one guy from the outside is trying to come in and get the score  But all these soldiers are out trying to hit him before he can even come close to Billy Mitchell  Yeah  Because he's not part of their crew  Right  You know, it's like they're the Goonies  And he's some other guy who's trying to fit in with the crew  And all that is what it's about and what makes it entertaining 
[01:51:30]  If it was just a movie about people trying to  No one would make a movie about people trying to break a high score on a Donkey Kong game  It's just ridiculous  The whole thing that they are so, so just hung up on themselves  And their priorities are from another planet  They're just so self-centered  But they do point out that it is a bigger deal than you think  Because not only is it the Donkey Kong record  It's also the Donkey Kong Jr. record  So it's two records  All right 
[01:52:00]  Well, there you go  It starts with this clip  Introducing  How do you say Mark's last name again?  Oh, this guy's great  His name is Mark Alpager  Yeah, what is his deal again?  He's just one of these guys, man  Like, I mean, he holds a few records  But he's not as, like  He's not  But he's got, like, the Q-Bert record  No, actually, that belongs to an 80-year-old woman  Oh, that's right  It did  Q-Bert  But, yeah, this guy  I think he holds the Crystal Castles record  Ooh  But not with playing with your hand  Playing with your foot  And they do show a clip of that in the movie  Where he's playing Crystal Castles 
[01:52:30]  With his awful sock foot  Yeah  They all get together as record holders  Well, some people call me Pigger  Mark Alpager  Pigger  It's a little nickname  Oh, I thought we were off the air for a second  That much  But I don't dislike it either  By the way, there's something for you  I abbreviate  I don't know if these guys abbreviate  Like, it's not Marble Madness  It's Marvel  It's not Crystal Castles  It's Crystal  It's not Paperboy  It's Paper  I don't know  Do you say Paper  Or do you say Paperboy? 
[01:53:00]  It's not  It's Paper  Right  No, it's not  Well, my title, of course  It's nothing  It's ancient drivel  But that's how, like, if you're cool  You'd be like, yeah, what's your high score of Paper?  Paper  I wouldn't say Paperboy  Why is that important to anyone?  Like, I don't get it  What's your Marble score?  Marble  Why would it matter if you say Paper instead of Paperboy?  Because it's like, you know, I'm inside  It's slang  What if I called it Madness? 
[01:53:30]  People would be like, what game is that?  But that's my way of saying Marble Madness  I would just go, dude, Madness  What, you mean Marble?  No, Madness  I've heard of Marble  I don't know this game you're talking about  See, this is what you get in the film, by the way  This is the type of dialogue that me and Sam were just having with each other  That type of just inane, moronic talk  They actually filled it and said, wow, this needs to be seen  Yeah, and take whatever sarcasm me and Sam were just doing  Yeah  I like to call it M.M. 
[01:54:00]  M.M.  M.M.  Marble Madness?  Yeah, M.M.  Now you're just out of the mix completely  I know  That's okay, though  I don't even get that  Is that the dude?  Yeah  He looked like Hitler's nephew  That's Pigger  That's Pigger, Jimmy  You don't know Pigger?  He's famous  He's good at Marble  Is he really?  Yeah, he's really  That's his high score of Paper  And Crystal  Pigger explains the game he likes  Well, my title, of course, is Crystal Castles  I love how he says, my title, of course  Of course  I can't believe I have to tell you  That's what people know  Everyone knows, but of course, I'll, you know 
[01:54:30]  Well, my title, of course, is Crystal Castles  Crystal Castles is where you control a bear  As dumb as that sounds  Normally, I'd describe a game like that as gay  But it is a kick-ass game  Yes  Control the bear  Normally, it's the bear who controls the cub  Gay, but it is a kick-ass game  I think it's one of the few games that has an ending  You know, he's saying how that game is gay 
[01:55:00]  Prove that you've ever been with a woman  Please  He doesn't have time  He doesn't have time for the girls  He's too busy setting these weird records  He's working on his Marble score  Marble, Crystal, whatever  I think it's one of the few games that has an ending  Especially that early  It's like, I want an ending  No, we want the game to go on and on  So players can play  And new quarters won't come in the machine  Idiots  It's the suits and their low brain power  That's the other thing  This isn't even the most classic clip of Mark Alperger 
[01:55:30]  The best clip of him is when he's describing  This weight-lifting glove that he bought in the 80s  And he starts talking  He's like, yeah, I found this in the 80s, man  He's like, it's just a fingerless weight-lifting glove  A guy for about 20 bucks  He goes, you could play Marble all day long  And he's like, showing you how you could just  You know, he's like  And he's talking about the padding  And how great the padding is  Oh, God, what an ass  I got the clip, here it is  How about we fix the CD players, please  I mean, seriously, please 
[01:56:00]  Hey, hey, Sully, Sully, Sully  Please  How would Sully react to that?  Come on, Sully, do a Sully  We got a malfunction  See, it's great  Sully  You're not landing in the river  And today's problem, by the way, Stunt Brain  The CD1 sticks  So sometimes you can't even turn off the pot  You want to play it at LaGuardia  Or you want to play it at Tita Barrow  Oh, yeah, I noticed that earlier 
[01:56:30]  And I've noticed that I didn't mention it to you guys  This is actually technically a weightlifting glove  Because I discovered in the 80s  That you could buy a weightlifting glove  Which was fingerless  And I used it to play Marble Madness  See the double padding?  Why didn't you say marble?  The guys that played marble  They used to call it a marble hand  You would get calluses  You would get pinches  You would get bruising from the pinches  That would get it  And so I said, you know, this is nuts 
[01:57:00]  I'm going to get a glove and protect my hand  When I played marble  When I played marble, there he said marble there  Yeah, well  And he says people would refer to it as marble hand  Him and maybe one friend  He probably said, I got marble hand  And they said, what is that?  Yeah, from playing around with his friends  Yeah, marble  And the marble bag  If that's true, then I got hog hand  From all my activity  Joystick hand  What an ass  But it's just chock full of morons like this 
[01:57:30]  Who, I don't know how whoever filmed this  Was it just laughing at them  And making them break concentration  And go like, hey, are you goofing on me?  It's the same guy who directed this  He just did that Four Christmases movie  Oh, really?  It's the same guy  That was just a warm up  We got the Billy Mitchell clips now  Billy!  Let's get right into Billy  Billy!  The king of Kong  He's the man  Yes  King of everything  Nobody can beat that record  Just ask him  He'll tell you  Tape and live  He'll do it all  Billy talks about the initials 
[01:58:00]  He uses for high scores  The clip band was  Well, whatever  Oh, yeah  I often have people ask me  What my handle is  What my three initials are  Often  Never  I mean, come on  I tell people, look at me  A-S-S  What do you think my three initials were?  D-I-C-K  J-O  A-H  F-Y  M-F-A-H  F-G-T  C-K-S-R 
[01:58:30]  A-I-D-S  I love how he sets this up often  He can't leave the house  He's a celebrity  The second he walks out  The hair  The tie  It's like  Jesus Christ  Can I live my life?  What do you think my three initials were?  If you don't know  You're not looking hard enough  T-I-E 
[01:59:00]  No  T-I-E  Which one was I wearing yesterday?  America  USA  USA  USA  So I had Latin friends  And I had Canadian friends  And I always had to keep the Americans on top  Boom  Thank you Billy  Oh thank you Billy  Thank you Billy Mitchell  God bless you  He's here for all of us  Is what people don't understand  Right  Screw Sully  We got the real hero  Yep  Right here  Exactly  Billy Mitchell  Exactly  Billy Mitchell would have landed that plane in that river  No problem 
[01:59:30]  Could have done it  Right  He would have gone all the way back to the airport  And done it safe  Exactly  He would have finished the flight  Yes  He would have landed where he was supposed to land  He would have flown that all the way down  He would have rolled up his sleeves and taken the geese out of the engines  Exactly  High score  Yes  Yes  He would have controlled it  He would have swatted them with the wings as they got close  Boodle-doo  Boodle-doo  Yeah the geese would have never got stuck in the engine  Right  No  Right Sam 
[02:00:00]  He would have saw it coming a mile away  He does what he does with excellence  Yes  He would have flown the plane like a pilot should  Like he avoids the barrels  He would have avoided the geese  Exactly  There wouldn't have even been turbulence on that flight  This next clip  Wow  Billy compares his record to Jimmy  This guy's the real deal  This is a hell of a comparison  If it's accurate  Uh  To taking a dump in your hand  If there's any accuracy in his way of thinking  This is very important to him 
[02:00:30]  And he compares his record to something that's very important to everybody  I had somebody draw an analogy for me once that I always remember  The top French pilot  In World War I shot down 24 enemy planes  The top American pilot  You don't know his name do you?  Nobody does  But it's Eddie Rickenbacker  Shot down 26 enemy planes  The German ace  The Red Baron  Everyone knows who the Red Baron is  That's because he shot down 87 enemy planes  I mean he was the best 
[02:01:00]  There's just  There's a level of difference between people  And it translates into some games  See  Any questions?  See  Billy Mitchell  He's saying that  That people that put their life on the line in World War I  Yeah  Flying, fighting, dying  Yes  He's pretty much the same  Oh yeah  He's on their level  In gaming  Some people fly planes in wars  Some people save princesses from Donkey Kong 
[02:01:30]  It's whatever you want to make of it  Sam's a douche  It is  Though you are right  It's what you make of it  Yes  Yes  It's brilliant though  How he simplifies things  He really does  He can take something so meaningful  And just an event  And history  A huge thing  That is a top priority  And just equate it  To  The nothingness  Of video gaming  The banality  That is his life  Yes  Of 80's video gaming  Not even now 
[02:02:00]  I don't even know if we have time  To get into his whole hot sauce  The hot sauce business  But  Hey this guy  A jack of all trades  Billy Mitchell  Billy Mitchell explains how controversial he is  No matter what I say  It draws controversy  Sort of like the abortion issue  If you're for it  People say I should have been one  People say I still could be one  That's right  Oh my god  The only thing he has in common  With the abortion issue  Is if he  Spilt his hot sauce  Out on the floor  Jesus 
[02:02:30]  How don't you  Not love this guy  He's the best  No matter what I say  It draws controversy  Yes  Sort of like the abortion issue  If you're for it  You're a son of a gun  If you're against it  You're a son of a gun  I'm not God  I don't have all the answers  So I have to be careful  How I share my opinions  The son of God  Right  Now that's who he is  Exactly  He's not God  He is Jesus  If you look at his hairstyle  Very Christ-like 
[02:03:00]  Right  The beard  And he's right  About the abortion thing  Because people  I've said  I'm a big Billy Mitchell fan  And they'll come up to me  And say  You son of a gun  You son of a gun  And I do see  When people protest  At abortion clinics  They have  Hey  You son of a gun  Don't do that  Exactly  Yeah  Yeah  The people who could get  Besides myself  That have been seen  Getting to the end  Of Donkey Kong  Gee now that I think about it 
[02:03:30]  I don't think anybody has  And that's the thing  He talks big  But when you back it up  With skill  It's not bragging  No  You know what I mean  It's just fact  And finally  The fortune cookie scene  You guys were talking about  The famous fortune cookie scene  From King of Kong  Does this have my name  On the back or something  What does it say  It says  You have a yearning  For perfection  Had to be a plan 
[02:04:00]  It had to be  It had to be  Because first of all  I've never seen  A fortune cookie  That even said anything  Remotely similar to that  Yeah  And for him to get it  When it matches your personality  To a T like that  Like that  It's amazing  I wouldn't be surprised  If he turned it over  And it was red, white, and blue  Exactly  Amazing  Donkey Kong stinks  Of course it does  It's an awful game  It was fun  When  Back in the 80's  For 10 minutes  I was never a big  Donkey Kong player 
[02:04:30]  Jimmy loved the asteroids  He was in the newspaper  He did  Saving the world  With it  But  Donkey Kong just  Frustrating  I didn't really like it  Billy Mitchell is  Just great  It's going to be  The game's going to be  Frustrating when  Billy Mitchell is your competition  Why play  I don't think it would ever happen  Yes  Because he won't show up  What a coward he is  What a  Tail between the legs  Yellow belly  Yeah  Why wouldn't he  Why wouldn't he play  Steve Wiebe  Head to head like that  Because if you're Tiger Woods  Are you going to show up

[02:17:00]  Without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today  Today we honor Michael T. Williamson  Who starred as Private Benjamin Buford Bubba Blue  In the 1994 Oscar winning Forrest Gump  I know everything they used to know about the shrimp and business  This marble mouthed idiot was blown in half by a landmine  And missed out on the opportunity to be the captain of a shrimp boat  Then Bubba said something I won't ever forget  I wanna go home  Good luck in the afterlife stupid 
[02:17:30]  Stay tuned for more icons of Black History  On the Opie and Anthony Show  Yeah he does those perfect  Perfect  I love that  We also have Drew Boogie here with Sean Benjamin  Do you guys remember Sean Benjamin?  No  No  You gotta remember Sean Benjamin  He brought his belly dancing chick  To the show  Oh well where's the fucking chick?  I thought you were joking you don't remember him  I remember the chick  Remember he's a starving artist 
[02:18:00]  He brought his belly dancing chick  We didn't know she belly danced at the time  And he was begging to play a little music for everybody  We said fuck that  You girls gotta like get naked and do a little belly dancing right?  I recall this  And the video did very very well  Right  Very well  And the music was very good  Thank you  We were expecting horrible music after that  But we didn't care  Cause we got to see your chick pretty much naked  But then it worked out for everybody  Oh no  Oh my god 
[02:18:30]  Raccoons at the White House  That's the story I want to see on MSNBC  Traps are baited with apples, cat food, and peanut butter  Yeah well  Wow  They have a raccoon problem at the White House  Why don't you take the rest of the day off please?  I think I should leave immediately  Before I say something that gets us fired  It's not your fault that they have a problem  They're talking with the trapper  I guess one of these raccoon trappers  They couldn't do this story when Bush was in office 
[02:19:00]  Like the raccoons just happened to show up  Well honestly they're saying that once you get raccoons  I mean it drops the property value  They're so hard to get rid of  I mean that's just what they're saying  Raccoons are very dangerous  Oh my god  I gotta bite my tongue  Please go home  Please  For the sake of the show  Just leave  You know  When you go down south  Yeah  They hunt raccoons  They do  We know they don't  Yes  And what they  Well I'm just saying  Yeah  Without saying  Yeah  They do have  And a lot of times they have a hunting dog 
[02:19:30]  That is a raccoon hunting dog  But they don't call it a raccoon hunting dog  No they don't do that  No  No  No  And I'll leave it at that  But raccoons at the White House  Yeah  Apparently  Raccoons have evaded capture despite several live traps  Live traps  See they don't want to hurt the raccoons  So what they're doing  Oh good god  Is putting live traps  Which is where they can capture them live  And then throw them out of the fucking White House  Animal experts say raccoons are able to adapt to city dwelling 
[02:20:00]  Yes  Yes they can  They absolutely can  I'm just reading what's on TV  The raccoon is very adaptable  Yeah  To city dwellings  This is not the first time raccoons have been spotted on White House grounds  Really?  That's what it says too  That's amazing  Because it's pretty much the first time I've ever even known about raccoons in the White House  MSNBC knows exactly what they're doing right now  What do you mean?  They're recording on raccoons in the White House  We got to 
[02:20:30]  I say  For the sanctity  Yeah  Of the White House  The White House is a very special place in this country  And it shouldn't be overrun  By the likes of raccoons  I agree  What we should do  Is find a way  To make sure  We get the raccoons out  Of the White House  Dude it could take years  It could take years  It could take two, three, fucking four years  However long it takes  I believe  There should never be a raccoon in the White House 
[02:21:00]  It's just bad for the image of the White House  It's horrible  It's horrible  I'm going to turn off the instant feedback  I've got to try to keep this safe today  Is it a whole family or is it just one or two?  Because if you get a family in there  And they start breeding  Yeah  Holy shit  Every fucking room  Is going to have a raccoon in it  Believe you me  I've seen them  I used to live in a neighborhood  Where the raccoons were out  Knocking over garbage pails 
[02:21:30]  Yeah  Driving through people's backyards  Yeah  They sounded a lot taller  On the radio  Do the bin  Do the bin  Yeah  Oh wow  He does not get it  Yeah  Well we're going to have to  Move on with Drew  Move on  Because you know  Seriously man  You and me  We're fucking done professionally  Yeah  That'll happen if  Yeah

Yeah, and Whack Bag's got all the info, too, if you were looking for the Drew Boogie CD,  right?  Come on.  How much is the, uh, how much has the CD?  The CD's $15.99.  Come on.  The president's got to eat.  You know what?  What?  I was going to do the right thing, but I only have $15.  No, you're not going to do that.  You'll be plugging it like crazy.  No, here.  Up on, uh...  You gave me a free one, but here, I want to, like... 
[02:26:30]  That's absolutely...  I want to set the tone.  You're going to have to claim that on your taxes.  I want to set the tone.  That's right.  Drew Boogie just accepted $20.  Right.  From the cheap fuck on the show, right?  Nice.  All right.  I want to pay for it, really.  I appreciate that.  Now, since Opie gave you $20, I only have $10, then $20 is a whole bunch of $100.  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to give you $10.  And Gregorio's $5 plus my $10 equals $30. 
[02:27:00]  Where are my two fives?  No, they learn fast.  Oh, how about this?  I pay full $15, and then I charge someone for plugs.  Shut the fuck up.  Wow.  I'd like residuals, because my voice is on that CD.  Do you see what's happening here, shit, dicks?  Oh, yeah.  It's going to get ugly.  We should sue him for using our voices.  Oh, would that be funny as shit?  All we've been doing is telling him to put out an album for years, and then we sue his ass off.  Oh, how great is that? 
[02:27:30]  We suck the lawyers on him.  Get him!  Hey, Drew, you bring any other copies?  Look, everyone's holding up money out there.  Oh, wow.  You're just dumb.  Everyone is just dumb.  You sold $20 today, easy!  You all got computers, right?  Yeah.  Download that shit.  How many copies you got?  I didn't bring any.  You didn't bring any.  I completely forgot about the studio audience.  I apologize.  This is what I'm going to do.  Now, I bought mine.  Now, sell it to somebody else, and you give me another copy. 
[02:28:00]  Okay.  How about this?  This guy's got money in there, man.  Why don't you sign it?  Now it's used.  You're going to have to sell it for cheap.  No.  If Opie signs it.  Opie signs it.  Oh, that's going to be why.  And then maybe Anthony signs it.  I have a solution.  And I'll put pre-com on it.  I'll go in the back.  I'll make copies, and I'll sell them to the crowd for $20 apiece.  What a mess.  That sounds really good, man.  And you'll get $5 or $7 per $20.  Oh, sure.  What happened?  All right.  Here.  You can sell this copy to somebody.  Just make sure you get me one.  Yes.  I'll get you yours.  But I want to play it this weekend. 
[02:28:30]  I'm playing it on the way home.  I'm torn.  I'm not stupid.  No, fuck that.  I want my copy.  Yeah.  Give me another track we can play for everybody.  All right.  Which one do you like?  Number two.  Number two?  This one is one I did with Sean Benjamin.  It's on the album.  It's called Pink Sock.  Okay.  Oh, Pink Sock.  I wonder what this is about.  Sean Benjamin is standing by.  He's going to play a legit song for us today.  Yes, he's going to play his song.  We'll get into that in a little bit.  But first, another track from the Drew Boogie CD.  No offense.  That's finally dropping almost 100 tracks on this damn thing. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  A slide on the wall of O&A.  This is the Pink Sock remix.  This girl I know, she could queef the national anthem.  And I yanked out her pink sock with scabs on it.  Speaking of which, here's Pink Sock by Sean Benjamin and Drew Boogie.  Keep it here on Radio The Boogie.  Radio The Boogie.  Pink RQ.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wow.  I think I fucked up.  Oh, no. 
[02:29:30]  That was not...  That's not Pink Sock.  That was not supposed to be out there.  Of course.  Absolute panic.  I've never seen what's in him panic.  Oh, you're panicking.  You have the worst marketing ever.  I know.  He brings two copies of the CD, none to sell.  Right.  And now you need me to do what?  Play it off here?  Yeah.  There's 100 tracks.  Which one?  Yeah, Drew.  Let me think.  Oh, my God.  Now we're just...  It's a mess.  We'll get it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Track 11 on disc two, right?

It's a dancer as a rose from love to star as a rock.  You're a little big star.  Big star.  Oh, my God.  You feel the passion for life.

[02:46:30]  little yeah i'll put this back i'll take that i think that's a compliment jimmy no it's all i'll put the  mic back this is no the the friend of mine i went to garage or whatever i was there barrel blew up in  front of me a barrel yet with a barrel waste barrel yeah waste barrel full gas blows up gas all over me  got burns third-degree burns on the leg so i have to wear a nice stocking oh you gotta wear like one  of those uh old man stockings yeah i don't know because there's uh wow why was there gas in a garbage 
[02:47:00]  pail no no like a waste barrel yeah why was there gas in that no no no no wow he's laughing at his  burns no you were uh i i understand it's a waste like so that if you gotta empty a gas tank out or  stuff like that yeah and how did what what set it off um there was a fault in the sump pump and  just sparked and boom a fault in the sump pump sounds like a lawsuit yeah you make any cake from 
[02:47:30]  that my friend that all happened in october it happened in october yeah wow so uh still pending  pending litigation i can't even feel it so pending litigation so you shouldn't say it hurts very  much yeah i forget we're on radio yeah yeah yeah you know you got a lot of pain i can't sleep at night  nothing yeah yeah well uh i want to say hi to the people in court right now that gets to listen to  this tape how you doing listen to the opie and anthony show on uh sm satellite radio you just cost

[02:49:30]  story makes the story even funnier is that when he called funnier than being on fire and when he was  on fire he appeared peeled off instead of like the normal thing would be for someone to rush him over  to an ambulance and call an ambulance and go right to the hospital he proceeded to drive himself home to  his house oh god you didn't go to a hospital according to him he went home what why did you do  that sir why because there was only two other people there they ran back inside the building  because the building was on fire to salvage some of the cars in there so i'm laying in the parking lot 
[02:50:00]  but why didn't you drive yourself to a hospital i couldn't i was right back out i had everything  to start and home was closer yeah home was so close so you went home and then what'd you do  uh i walked in my mom was standing right there and she started flipping out  yeah i guess i'll take your shoes and burning legs off  yeah you're getting skin on the rug you're dripping burning flesh all over my my linoleum  she's like what's that smell  that's very good improv  david anything else you picked a winner there david

[02:51:00]  yeah see what nothing oh my god let's move on let's move on you got other people yes okay thank you so  thank you paul for me thanks guys yeah let's hear it for paul there goes paul uh and his uh burning  leg story where are we going next with this very interesting is what david said  oh what what what what's the matter what are you fag no okay we got okay if you want to do this one  we have the next one is cat from florida where's the bitch ah there you go from florida yes we have 
[02:51:30]  some females in the house today in the in the his in the his house holy shit she gets a big invite  you walk like you have a fucking place to be don't you cat she's sexy she's also known as baby  kins on uh pal talk i haven't been on pal talk in so long you haven't no no no there you go hi baby  kins i don't know you as baby kins i just know you as cat the chick in front of me there's buttons on  your slacks slack now how did uh how did uh david rate your story yeah um apparently very interesting 
[02:52:00]  very interesting was that right david yes why why is that david is it because uh maybe you know  you have a little uh got a little crush on her maybe a little maybe a little she's a looker  yes yeah can't you like the jews what do you like no no okay yeah she's being honest  all right who does really though okay so she's cat from florida she's an abortion nurse in florida 
[02:52:30]  all right wow otherwise wow as a crime stopper wow yes amazing it certainly is and uh it certainly  is yes and what what interesting uh story if you might set it up david well we don't have any she  couldn't have been telling interest and interesting stories about being an abortion nurse but she told  me that uh she got off she from florida she got off the plane in new york city and saw snow for the 
[02:53:00]  first time ever in her life she's like in her in her early 20s and this is the first time seeing snow  ever in her life and that's crazy right that's crazy yes she's never seen snow before crazy can i  interject a thought here um i don't know murdering the young is kind of more interesting than seeing  snow for the first time holy shit i mean if you want to you want to talk about interesting stories  let it snow let it snow let it snow we've lost interest let's talk about the little arms you're  about 
[02:53:30]  let's talk about that let's talk about all the what could have been she told me  hold on i'm talking to someone who murdered someone who possibly would have cured cancer  oh my god i think she's fucking sexy but she saw snow that's not quite as interesting as playing god  so what is she's just a nurse so she only follows orders absolutely what's the nuttiest thing that 
[02:54:00]  happened like in the middle of it they go i chain my mind you went oh a leg two legs  oh my god why the babies has hats  i like that they gotta have fun here's a good bedside manner  come on they would have grown up to be stupid anyway  that dumb face well david why don't you talk to her yeah interview uh cat for us uh david okay well  you can go with the snow thing if you want whatever well she proceeded to tell me that she's 
[02:54:30]  in her lifetime she's seen more abortions than she has snow  wow yes  and uh well let's be honest she doesn't mean individual flakes because when she got on the plane  yeah yeah yeah she's priced a lot more yeah then you know that would suck if they could you couldn't  take off because there were fetuses on the wing and they had to defeat us the wing  it's fetus thing in chicago o'hare  if sully flies through a few that's true shoot him out the back of the jet engine 
[02:55:00]  oh boy what else you said very interesting she proceeded she proceeded you're like a fucking  cop talking about a perp she told me that when she got off the plane at jfk airport  she got naked and made rolled around in the snow and made snow angels  wow how about that yes snow angels yes in the snow as opposed to the little angel she creates  every time she starts a vacuuming yes yes jimmy you got it oh my god oh my god so uh 
[02:55:30]  oh david and she she also said that if someone were to bring like a huge pile of snow up to the studio  she would consider getting naked and rolling around in in in a pile of snow and make snow angels  wow wow very nice yeah thanks for telling us now that the fucking snow is melting can we do something 
[02:56:00]  else like uh get the interns to rip up paper and make it look like snow she proceeded to say that for  she was all she was asking for a minimal a minimal fee for the for this that turns me over that be how  much 33 50 consider it done 33 50 is a nice round number to roll around in snow naked and make snow angels  what an odd number that is she said that she has to have enough snow so that she can roll around in it properly 
[02:56:30]  yeah yeah of course david get her naked so can someone go get snow  outside there's snow all over the ground outside all over the grass and now everywhere there's snow  delegating responsibility as the executive intern i tell someone to go outside and get snow yes  yes i want to see pussy someone drive to buffalo and bring back a dump truck hole there's snow outside  well david we might not be able to get snow so why don't you use your talents to try to get her naked  yeah let's let's see how smooth you are let's see how you would get this done we've done this many 
[02:57:00]  times in our career well if there's no snow yeah go ahead let's see what you got let's go what do you  got i don't know well unfortunately we can't get snow so uh would you still just roll around on the  ground here and get naked would that would that be okay very smooth david well we have crushed glass  would you lay on that you're waiting for an answer david you gotta keep the heat on you gotta keep the heat  on keep working keep working would it be possible to see would it be possible to see you naked just for 
[02:57:30]  nothing maybe the confidence that you had in that statement is staggering yeah she's just looking at  you david g there's no reaction you you you're not working this right what would it take for for you to  get naked on for the show i mean there you go i know you wanted to roll around this no but we can't  provide it unfortunately so what can we do and then what can we do instead honestly david right now

[03:04:00]  oh god what was that phony enthusiasm all right go ahead david this is noah from new jersey he uh  goes around every day and cleans uh tankers that are lining the new jersey turnpike every day  that's right yep the oil tankers the oil tankers that line the new jersey turnpike he actually goes  inside those oil tankers and goes and cleans them all out when you're passing by elizabeth  david wasn't taking the papers being fed to him this is david's pick and he has this is my pick 
[03:04:30]  yeah he was interesting because he has an interesting story about one of his co-workers  oh wow see sam shut the fuck up maybe it's a co-worker story no forget the co-worker let's  get you need the action right at the beginning all right you need the action right at the beginning  of the movie sam that's true you don't want character development or anything like that  see david knows i'm part of the youtube generation i know it's a span of a nat 
[03:05:00]  it's a douche  oh no what do we say about cat  let's get cat back in here  i heard you  right  it's not nearly convincing enough  the good thing about cat is the camera that's out there that's facing towards the bleachers is facing  right down her shirt  which is purple  oh really  i think we passed i think we passed cat and moved on to you now noah  oh shit david  set the record straight  david i don't want any trouble  all right work this david what do we got  so he cleans the oil tankers on the new jersey turnpike and something 
[03:05:30]  one day happened to his one of his co-workers on them while he was on the job  okay  we had a guy his name was skip or at least that's what we called him his name was skip  uh-oh the was part  there's a male yes it should  uh-huh  uh-huh  uh-huh  uh-huh  uh-huh  it was like the david  and go all right let's go  so we were clear we can have the tankers at uh... uh... elizabeth right next to the 
[03:06:00]  turnpike there and we can have the oil tankers when they're empty and this guy  he was an old-school guy and he just said fucking every single day of his life and he  would smoke cigarettes inside he would take off his respirator and he would smoke  cigarettes in the place  he did not give a shit and the one day this is probably i was two months into my  job maybe  and this guy dropped dead of a heart attack right in the middle of the oil  tanker  oh it's all  well damn i thought it was going to be some kind of like  explosion or something no explosion no explosion but this guy dropped dead in 
[03:06:30]  the middle of the oil tanker  we had to clear the whole entire job out this guy came in  drop dead and then we had it uh... you hear on the movies it's called red code  blue but this was code green and the code green  cold green  david likes that  well it's just any code it was as he set it up in saying oh code green he made a  point to let me know what cold color code it was and what does code green mean  david  apparently according to noah from new jersey code green is like the most serious of  all codes like emergency emergency very very very serious 
[03:07:00]  this is higher than red or blue  higher the highest why is it serious if the guy's dead though david that's pretty  serious that he died a guy's died on the job serious anymore we had a heart attack  in the middle of the guy what's the emergency though yes the emergency is that he had a  heart attack in the middle of the oil tanker i know but there's no emergency  anymore what's the rush to do for him  yes well the rush was that he dropped onto the ground had a heart attack and they  had to rush him before so that they could at least try to save his life  code green  did you ask why they clean out the oil tanker were they only going to put more oil in it 
[03:07:30]  no i did not ask him would you like me to ask him to know what david thank you  that's about the url  no why do they clean up these oil tankers they're going to put like fresh oil in it  forget the fucking sediment and cook out  david that's a terrible question  i don't know why do you do that  uh it's just a matter of residue it's just a matter of buildup and residue there's there's  certain chemicals and properties of the oil that  grab that line  uh...  uh... 
[03:08:00]  uh...  uh...  uh...  uh...  uh...  are we done with it you're a lot of you're a lot of like what do you got  have to wear when you're inside these oil tankers that's a great question  a white tuxedo  uh...  uh...  okay let's move on  what do you have to do we move on  what do you have to do i think i'm terrible  what do you have to worry you can't back in here  uh...  that's all i wanted to say  that they have a good 
[03:08:30]  one of you guys definitely could have gotten our shirt off  i know we're going to go back to that trust me  boyfriend's right there  what does he share them we got money  we got money to throw out this situation david  yes let's move on really  all right so real quick what do you have to wear when you're in the oil tankers  no terrible question  moving on man move on to the next guy  do you ever moonwalk on the slippery floor  all right i guess that's it all right thank you so much  noah from new jersey  good job noah  he saw a dead guy that's pretty good 
[03:09:00]  yes he saw a dead guy drop dead in the middle of his  are you gonna do the one sam  are you gonna do the one sam keeps handing to you  yes  yeah do the one sam watches do the one  okay we'd like to bring to the show  hoselius from amaranek  oh  what  is that his name  hoselius is his name yes  why is sam laughing  i just want him to say hoselius  that's only a reason  that's only a reason  and also because  also because he was here last week  this is the ma-marinac guy from last week 
[03:09:30]  this is the ma-marinac guy  yes it's the ma-marinac guy  david we could get a note date  because last week you suggested that sam hangs out with the ma-marinac guy  yes i suggested it because sam  wait i just want to bring everyone up to speed  this guy  for those of you that don't know  every time he says it  huh  yeah  i got it  every time i say you're going to ring the bell  no no no no no  david  david  no  david  bring everyone up to speed  okay for those 
[03:10:00]  what was this guy's deal last week  this is hoselius from ma-marinac  ding ding ding  yeah  and um  sam also  our producer sam roberts also lives in ma-marinac  and according to this guy  he has a favorite deli in ma-marinac  that sam was unfamiliar about  so i proceeded to ask him  if he would take sam around the town of ma-marinac  and show him what he's missing in the town  doesn't he drive limos too or something like that  he doesn't drive them  he orders  he's like a dispatcher  and orders the normal drivers to pick up the people  he doesn't actually drive them  orders them  yes  so that's what we learned last week 
[03:10:30]  he's back today so let's get an update  okay  what's going on  all right so hoselius  it's jose luiz  hoselius  because i am hoselius  jose luiz  and maybe you're that to you  but to me it's hoselius  jose  jose luiz  jose luiz showed  david his id because  david said i don't remember his name  and i said so find out  so jose showed him the id  and david said  oh right hoselius  and he goes no it's jose luiz 
[03:11:00]  and david goes  right hoselius  oh what a tool  yep  that's right  yep  all right let's get the update  so now how is he rated  yeah  i have no idea  he's rated not very interesting  all right  because of the because of the update that's coming along  he's not very interesting  let's get the update  yet i got asked to come up here  i don't know  it's your show  let's go  it's just an update  okay so this is an update  so we asked you last time  if you would be so kind as to show sam around the town that he lives in  take him to the delhi  what's out 
[03:11:30]  what's out  marionek  all right  ding the bell anthony  ding the bell  oh there you go  okay  so  that's a bad one  because sam doesn't know  i just got a blue screen of death over here  on the  because sam doesn't know  sam doesn't know the town that he lives  and he's unfamiliar with where he lives  so  what  did you proceed to show  did you take sam to your favorite delhi of choice  in marionek  no i did not  i did not get the chance  yeah he knows  why didn't you  fuck him  he never gave me a call  he had my info  oh wow  why wouldn't one of our staff call a listener to hang out every day 
[03:12:00]  yeah why don't you ask sam  you got both guys in the room here  sam  sam  hozilius said that you did not call him  and asked him to take him to his favorite delhi  is that true  that is true  why didn't you call hozilius up and hang out with him  because  i didn't have  i can't go through the paperwork here  it's private  so i went to the marionek phone book  and looked up at hozilius  and i couldn't find one person of a marionek  yes but hozilius  last time  proceeded to give you his information 
[03:12:30]  where he lives  his number  he gave you his info  oh did he  yes hozilius  don't you realize you're saying his name too much now  so you don't know comedy  you should have just left it like it was  now you're saying hozilius too much  okay i'll stop saying that  because we were laughing at it at first  but now  once we stop laughing at hozilius  yes  now you're laughing  you're like me when i was  yes because we're wishing that cat had gotten to you sooner  all right so the update is they didn't connect

[03:23:30]  alright back to David  so David who's our last guest  guest from the audience  that you picked out  our last guest that I picked out  is Stacy from Long Island  Stacy's in studio  ok  alright  and why did you bring her in here  well I brought her in here  because  let's just say  she was very rude to me  were you being rude Stacy  I was so rude  and I was like 
[03:24:00]  why did he call me in here  actually  I wasn't just rude  baby girl was feeding me lines  and then I was saying to him  but he didn't even want to come over  and talk to me  in the first place  what's the matter  you got your back to her  and everything there  what's up David  you really don't like Stacy  he's scared of me  no I don't like her  no  why  what's the matter  what's wrong with her  what's she do  what's she do  I tried to ask her a bunch of questions  get to know her  see if she had any interesting stories  they said  Kat said  go talk to Stacy  and you said no 
[03:24:30]  why'd you say no  she's a girl  it's very rare  that we get girls here  in the studio  and I think they should all be spoken to  and probably courteous  yeah  courteously  not like you talk to them  apparently you're completely inept  when it comes to talking to girls  that's right David  you're very rude  now talk to her David  well  can I say  before I do that  can I say why  what made her be rude to me  can I tell  yeah of course you can  okay so I was proceeding  to ask her a bunch of 
[03:25:00]  questions  and  and she's like  she said to me  David why are you Jewish  well why  I proceeded to say  that's my religion  I was born  into a Jewish family  yeah but isn't it a religion  you could just change it  if you want right  but Jewish is different  than religions  isn't it  no Jewish is a religion  no no  but it's kind of different  in that  like if you're Catholic  you can just change to like  whatever you want  except for you know  Jewish 
[03:25:30]  but you can still do that  but if you're born Jewish  you're pretty much Jewish  no matter what you change to  that's correct  I think so  or if you stop practicing  like if you weren't a practicing  religious Jewish person  right  by  by  talking  or walking down the street  someone might be able  to identify you  as a Jewish person  right  why is that  it's just the way  people like  a lot of Jews  they look  they look Jewish 
[03:26:00]  they got characteristics  so isn't that odd  that a religion  which is just this  ideological thing  has an actual  biological  effect  on people  of the Jewish religion  yeah that's true  like a lot of people  walk up and say  oh you're Jewish  they don't even know me  they didn't see I'm Jewish  yes  exactly  I just always found that  a little odd  is all  very good observation  yes  continue  all right  continue now  with Stacey  so 
[03:26:30]  hey Stacey  how you doing  I'm doing alright  I feel a little more  empathy now  that I have a background  on you  I wasn't trying  to be nasty  I was just trying  to be funny with you  so she asked why  I was Jewish  and then  and then after I  gave her my answer  she said  said David  I think you're retarded  aww  that's hurtful  yes  that's hurtful  and then after  and then after she said  that I proceeded  to walk away from her  and not ask her  any more questions  well why don't you  ask her why  she said that  David you should  ask some questions  you gotta get  to the bottom of this 
[03:27:00]  okay  Stacey why did you  call me retarded  because someone  asked me to ask you that  ah  and because you're  kind of retarded  seems like you got  something else to say  there David  Stacey  were you rude  to me because  I noticed that  you resembled  David Cassidy  what  Jesus Christ  David  David  you are  fucking brutal  David you look 
[03:27:30]  like an easy target  you gotta like  have some confidence  with women  immediately they said  talk to her  and you were like  no  it was like  you had pee  running down your leg  instantly  damn  damn  damn  David  wow  Stacey  all I have to say  is how does it feel  being the seventh  prettiest girl  here today  fuck  David  David  David  that's just  it can't be more 
[03:28:00]  than  seven girls  here today  David  you are an ass  David  that's insane  that's terrible  that isn't even  isn't even accurate  and that's terrible  that's terrible  David  the seventh  pretty girl  that's crazy  that's terrible  the seventh  prettiest girl  that's terrible  yeah  comment  you're the  seventh prettiest  girl  Stacey  well  Stacey  is sixth  it's all in the  delivery  I guess  you definitely  nailed that one  so I just 
[03:28:30]  the only reason  why I'm being rude  to her  is because  she was rude  to me  that's right  quid pro quo  David  yes  yes  an eye for an eye  as they say  in the Old Testament  right  yes that's correct  quid while you're ahead  damn  damn  she fucking  shut you right up  that's right  so because she was  so rude to me  I just didn't want to  have anything to do  with her anymore  and I stopped  interviewing her 
[03:29:00]  and finished  the finished  yeah  interviewing her  is that what you call it  but she might have  something good for the show  yeah  yeah she called me a retard  I don't want to talk  to someone who thinks  I'm a retard  alright then  you're not going to  talk to anybody  it's going to be a  silent fucking world  for you  what is that supposed to mean  uh you're a retard  he's just kidding  David  I know  I'm teasing David  I saw the show  I know  David what do you got  is it  do you  Stacey  he just dropped  some  I just  I got a hat  because I got  a lot of them  in my hand at once  I got a lot of them

[03:30:00]  I don't get it  David  she went after  your religion  that's terrible  of course  David  should have gone  for like the cat toy  attract more  pussy thing  I don't know  yeah something  anything but that  last one  well  well David  well you know  Stacey  I can just  change religions  you can't just  sprout tits  yes I can  thank you very much  those are implants  right  do you have implants  by the way  I do  33 was a gift  to myself  wow  33
