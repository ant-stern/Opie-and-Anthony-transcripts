<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, featuring numerous in-studio guests and caller interactions.  The show opened with a “Worst of the Week” countdown hosted by Sam Roberts, seamlessly transitioning into a discussion with returning guest Ian Halperin. Halperin detailed his recent activities, including rigorous tennis playing, his new TV show “House Guest” (involving living with different families), and work on a hockey player biography.  His physical fitness became a recurring comedic point, prompting comparisons with the hosts’ own physiques. The conversation frequently digressed into tangents involving past guests (Mike Tyson, Jesse Ventura, George St-Pierre), various books, the hosts' personal lives, and critiques of late-night television personalities (Arsenio Hall, Pete Holmes, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel).  A caller questioned Halperin about a previous claim regarding a Hollywood disease.  A clip from Halperin's Lady Gaga documentary, "Chasing Gaga," was also mentioned.  The segment included Nick Offerman discussing his book, "Paddle Your Own Canoe," an anecdote about Anthony's experience in Montreal, a reminiscence about a previous show with Julianne Moore, and the hosts' disdain for the remastered *Gladiator*'s lack of blood and teeth.  The segment concluded with a discussion about Lou Reed and the hosts' appreciation for Laurie Anderson, all interspersed with frequent crude and offensive language from the hosts and Halperin.


The show continued with a discussion about smoking on airplanes, leading into another segment with Nick Offerman.  Offerman shared anecdotes from "Paddle Your Own Canoe," including a humorous encounter with Harry Connick Jr. This segued into a conversation about Lou Reed's death, featuring a phone call with Black Earl, whose rambling and tangential responses regarding Reed's significance and his choice of "New York City Man" as Reed's best New York song were heavily satirized.  The segment then shifted to an in-studio interview with comedian Brian Regan, who shared humorous stories about his career, family life, and dating experiences, including awkward audience interactions and coping mechanisms for difficult situations on the road.  Numerous advertisements were aired throughout this segment.


A “Worst of the Week” countdown, punctuated by commercial breaks, dominated the next section. Aziz Ansari, Penn Jillette, and Tim Conway were in studio. A significant portion focused on a recurring caller, "Lady Di," whose rambling, incoherent conversation about attending a Jim Norton show, being unemployed for ten years, and drinking Natty Ice in the mornings was met with mockery from the hosts and guests.  Penn Jillette discussed his *Celebrity Apprentice* experience, expressing frustration at losing to Trace Adkins despite believing his ice cream was superior, and detailing his perceived betrayal by the Opie and Anthony hosts.  Further "Worst of the Week" segments and advertisements concluded this portion.


A subsequent segment featured an in-studio interview with Tim Conway, joined by Brian Regan. The conversation, often improvised, devolved into sarcastic and insulting exchanges from Conway, with topics including his career (*The Carol Burnett Show*), army experience, and dyslexia.  Conway frequently deflected questions, forgot previous answers, and made disparaging remarks, with Regan occasionally attempting to steer the conversation.  Numerous commercial breaks and the hosts' own commentary punctuated the interview, which ended with a discussion of Conway's upcoming book signings. This segment also included discussions of hair loss and aging, with Judd Apatow joining the conversation. Apatow shared anecdotes from his career, focusing on *Freaks and Geeks* and *Undeclared*, including casting choices and industry challenges, and his Grammy Awards work.  Profanity was heavily used throughout.


The show concluded with an interview with Judd Apatow, largely centered on his films, particularly the critical response to *Knocked Up* and Katherine Heigl's comments about its sexism.  Apatow explained his perspective, highlighting the theme of immaturity and the characters' portrayals. He discussed his collaborations with Jonah Hill, Russell Brand, and Leslie Mann, defending his casting choices. A significant portion covered his personal struggles with panic attacks, including a detailed anecdote about a flight and a wedding, describing symptoms, management strategies, and the help of therapy.  He also shared memories of Chris Farley, praising his comedic talent and unique stage presence. The interview concluded with promotional announcements.

It's caused by water, attracted by the ethanol that's in your gas tank right now.  Ethanol is in nearly every gallon of retail gas.  It attracts 50% more water than unleaded.  And with water, that means corrosion can begin at any time.  But you can protect your engine with the BG ethanol defender service.  BG cleans, dries, and protects the entire fuel system.

When we take the best of this week's Opie and Anthony Show, call it the worst, wait in, and then count it down for your listening pleasure.  Here's your host, what?  Sidney Face.  It's that time.  The promo and the production and everything said it.  It's the Worst of the Week Countdown.  I'm Sam Roberts, and I host this here, Countdown, every single week. 
[00:01:30]  You know me from the Opie and Anthony Show.  This week, a big week of shows to highlight.  Lady Di made her return.  Lots of in-studio guests.  Brian Regan, Nick Offerman from Parks and Rec, also from Parks and Rec, Aziz Ansari, Penn Jillette in studio, and of course, the legendary Tim Conway.  But first, Ian Halperin.  You want to talk about returns to the show.  So, His Highness Hollywood, Ian Halperin, not that many people infuriate the listeners more than Ian Halperin does. 
[00:02:00]  How much of what he says is true, and how much of what he says is bullshit?  I'll give you a hint.  It's probably all bullshit.  Ian Halperin, his triumphant return to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just give us a little update.  What have you been doing?  What are you working on?  In the last two years.  You know, fill the audience in on where you've been.  I've been working on my tennis game a lot.  Oh, yeah?  I'm playing a lot of tournaments.  What do you mean you're playing a lot of pro tennis players? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, I'm playing.  We like to say tournaments in America, by the way.  Tournaments.  Tourney?  Tournaments.  Look, I ain't going to Wimbledon, but tennis is a way of life for me.  I play about six times a week.  Wow.  Do you really?  Yes, I do.  Show me something.  Hey, the big rackets below the waist, so I'm not going to show you that.  Well, can't you do, like, some air tennis?  I'm a lefty.  Let me tell you something.  What?  I'm a lefty.  Like John McEnroe.  Nadal would not be Nadal if he wasn't a lefty. 
[00:03:00]  Mack, who I know was on the show recently, wouldn't be Mack if he wasn't a lefty.  We definitely have an advantage.  Do you guys play tennis?  Hell no.  It's a girl sport.  Oh.  So how's life, guys?  What's going on?  It looks like I haven't missed a beat here in two years.  I haven't seen you guys.  Well, we asked you what you're doing, and you said you play tennis.  I told you I'm playing a lot of tennis.  And he's got a bag of books.  Why do you got a bag of books?  Because nobody reads the books that comes in here from your publicists who bring on the guests.  They're just sitting in the office, so I grab them all. 
[00:03:30]  They're collecting dust.  I love to read.  I read about two, three books a week.  Well, show us what you grab.  Make a quick pile and find it.  We have Pierce Morgan, who, you know, all these guys seem to have a ghostwriter attached  to these books.  Yeah, you write your own stuff.  You know, Tom Sizemore.  Who's the best one?  George St. Pierre, fellow Canadian.  I heard he's a bit of a dick, actually.  How was he on the show here, St. Pierre?  I miss that day.  He's mellow.  He's fine.  We were behind Rousey after him or before him. 
[00:04:00]  All right, and what else?  This one, Cracked.  Cracked Magazine.  There's a lot of funny stuff in here.  Cracked Magazine.  Yeah.  They did a book.  Now, Dr. J, I understand he's coming in.  He's coming back.  Maybe tomorrow, I think.  Is it tomorrow?  I think so.  Apparently, he had a daughter.  Or soon.  Play tennis.  Yeah, that's right.  I know that.  Fantastic.  Supposedly, she was pretty good.  And they were estranged for years, and then he hooked up with her again, and he did the honorable  thing and became a dad.  Wait, when did this come in? 
[00:04:30]  We have to read this for tomorrow?  When was the last time you read a book for one of the guests?  Oh, Jimmy reads books.  I read them.  You read them?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Jimmy does.  I'll read what I can.  Wait, is that the Dr. J book and all books?  Dude, what type of diet are you on?  You look fantastic.  Look, what are you doing?  He's amazing.  I've just been eating blueberries.  This is Mr. Blueberry Face.  What are you doing?  The cold-pressed juice diet or something?  No, I'm just eating.  I'm going to the gym and eating butter in general.  Which gym do you go to in New York?  Give them a plug.  No, in my building, let's just say.  But I go to a separate gym.  Are you doing yoga or something, too? 
[00:05:00]  No, no deal.  Just gym.  Cardio?  Oh, my God.  A little cardio.  I do usually four or five days in the gym with trainers a week.  Because with all due respect, he looks in the best shape, other than the three of you.  All right.  Especially below the weight.  You two look like you haven't been hitting the gym recently.  I hit the gym, sir.  You do?  Get the fuck out of here.  I'm an animal.  Look at Anthony's guns.  That's true.  I'm an animal.  You're already aggravating the listeners.  I can't wait to go to the phones.  Oh, yeah.  Hold on.  What other books?  You got the Dr. J?  Paddle Your Own Canoe.  How was this dude?  Nick Offerman was really cool.  He's a mustache guy from Parks and Rec. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  He got a mustache.  He looked all crazy.  Who's been the best guest you've had on in the two years since this year?  Ozzy Osbourne.  No.  Has Jesse Ventura been back?  You know what?  No, he hasn't been back in a while.  Because that was a classic.  Jimmy and Jesse Ventura.  He's one of the best we've had on because he's such an asshole.  Tyson.  Yep.  That was my answer, too.  Mike Tyson was amazing.  He's a nice guy.  Although one of his appearances was mellow.  He's done three now.  He's done two amazing and one just kind of mellow.  And the day he was mellow, his wife was in the studio. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  So I see what's going on there.  But he was also, don't forget, still active in his addiction then, which he finally came  out with.  I can't wait to get his book and read it, man.  Oh, that's right.  Yes.  I want to ask him about that.  And recently, Tim Conway is amazing.  Tim fucking Conway.  I thought he was staring at wood, Tim Conway.  Is he still around?  Oh, yeah.  That's a good name.  Hey, this is Timmy Woodstarrer.  He's looking at wood.  He'll be 80 in December.  And he was great on the show.  He's going to be on our podcast next week.  By the way, I should mention this week, it's Neil deGrasse, right? 
[00:06:30]  He was amazing.  Neil deGrasse Tyson.  Another one.  We figured out the fucking universe with this guy, and it's on our podcast that you could  get today.  So please go and do that.  The Opie and Anthony podcast comes out every Wednesday, and that's what you got this week.  All right?  And then people are requesting Conway already, so it'll be on next Wednesday's podcast.  Anyway, that's not important to Ian.  I heard the show got very big since I've been gone.  Well?  Our show?  Yeah.  Huge.  I think we have a few more listeners. 
[00:07:00]  It depends who you talk to.  I think we have a few more listeners.  Yeah.  Some people think we're complete failures, and others think we're actually moving.  From what I hear, you guys have been making a lot of noise.  We're on the street?  Yeah, definitely.  Definitely.  I think you're bigger and better than before, and now the show's gone completely downhill  since I'm on.  I was going to say, what's the difference?  And one is that you haven't been here in a while.  What about Sam over here?  I mean, he looks like he just got circumcised or something.  Well, that's probably, you know. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, it looks like they cut a little bit off his schmeckle.  It's like, yeah, he looks like schmeckle.  He looks like I'm on a funeral parlor, and, you know, the corpse is semi-aligned.  Dude, when was the last time you took a vacation?  That's probably the biggest change since you've been here.  Our own Sam Roberts went from lowly, you know, a little office boy to now a professional  broadcaster.  That's true.  He's got shows on, all these channels.  Well, he works hard.  He works hard.  He works hard, which, you know, that kind of is the excuse for his lackluster appearance. 
[00:08:00]  Do you have seven figures in the bank?  No, I'm getting there.  That's good.  He's married, has a lovely wife.  Yes, seven.  Beautiful wife.  You only have seven.  I'm working at five.  Five's not bad.  Five figures?  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  Not quite there yet.  Ian, people...  Do you think you'll ever be a superstar?  Like Stern, like Opie and Anthony?  I mean, Stern, Opie and Anthony, they're synonymous.  They're radio legends.  Oh, yeah.  You should be kissing their feet every fucking time you come into the studio. 
[00:08:30]  That's right.  Your name ought to be Tootsie Kisser.  Oh, God.  You know, I was playing tennis the other day, and guess who's on the next court?  Let me guess.  Let me guess.  Oh.  A-Rod.  Yeah, right next to me.  Yeah?  And my perception of him changed.  Why?  I was on with his daughters, and Cynthia was there, too.  Just the four of them.  Who was with him?  Cynthia.  Oh, okay.  And his two kids.  Who's Cynthia?  His ex?  His ex.  And I gotta say, kudos to A-Rod.  I've never seen a guy better with kids.  Yeah.  He was fantastic.  Hey, wait a minute.  I fucking...  I'm good with him. 
[00:09:00]  The only time I ever played tennis is this fucking guy, Milos,  and he made me...  Who, the Canadian?  No, it was a fucking Russian guy.  I think it was Russian.  Okay.  And he wanted to impress his chick on the fucking court.  So he, like, asked me, you know, Anthony, could you please, you know,  make it look like I am good at tennis?  But then as I helped him, the guy's bad-mouthing me.  Like, oh, look at what a little girl.  Look, you're going to cry, baby.  So I just fucking, like, fucking power-served it. 
[00:09:30]  Never trust a gay Russian.  Right down his fucking throat.  No, no, no.  He's trying to impress his chick.  Send him back to Siberia.  Give him a good lunch there.  I could have fucked this chick.  I could have fucked this chick.  Well, Russian chicks are hot.  Have you ever banged a Russian chick?  Um, hmm.  Let me see.  Yeah, she's always in a hurry.  Hey, Chippa.  Chippa, you are the best.  Double borscht.  We got a guy on the line that wants to ask you about something you said last time you were on our show. 
[00:10:00]  What?  It's fair enough.  How can I remember that?  I'm practically suffering from, uh...  Ian.  Yes, yes.  Listen to Jason.  From Indy.  Ian, I want to call you a name, but I really need the answer to this question, so I'm going to wait.  So, last time you were on the show, you said there's some horrible disease sweeping Hollywood.  It's worse than AIDS.  It's going to start killing everybody.  What the hell?  I haven't heard one thing about Michigan.  Actually, there was a disease sweeping Hollywood, sweeping parts of the U.S. shortly after.  I guess they controlled it, but dude, Google it, man. 
[00:10:30]  Google it.  Google it.  Listen, get his own catchphrase now.  Get back here and get her done.  Google it.  How have you been?  Where have you been?  You sound more sexually frustrated.  Oh, shit.  More depressed, you know, with all due respect to you.  When I Google it, the only thing I find is Ian's a fucking mongoloid.  You know what?  You should only live like this mongoloid one day of your life, and God bless.  I wish you all the best. 
[00:11:00]  You're sleeping Hollywood, you douche.  How are things with the ladies?  They're always good.  I like hearing about your sexploits.  Yeah.  No, there's no more sexploits.  Why?  I'm practicing serial monogamy.  You go gay?  What happened?  I have sex with serial?  All right, Chip.  That's a good one, Chip.  Hold on, Chip.  Whoa, he's got a girlfriend.  You got a girlfriend, Chip.  Yeah, what's that about?  How long?  She's a lawyer, and, you know, I'm very serious and just leading a low-key life. 
[00:11:30]  You know, that's...  You're not uncovering anything these days?  Yeah, I'm working on a TV show.  It's called House Guest.  Every week, I stay with a different family.  I just came back from England.  I shot there.  I stayed with a professional roller derby player.  Just the word yourself was in there.  My husband's a clinical psychologist, and by the end of my stay, they split.  Wow, what happened?  You fucking...  She was like, you can't fucking compete with His Highness.  Well, no, I didn't bang her. 
[00:12:00]  Again, I'm practicing serial monogamy these days.  Oh, yes.  What are you dating?  I made them realize they weren't compatible.  We got it the first time, Chip.  They weren't compatible.  But tell me how the show goes down.  You go away with them for how long?  A week.  I stay with them for a week.  And then what do you do?  A little...  Cameras are all over the place.  So you're going to work with the people?  And I just infiltrate their zone.  Okay.  Getting their space.  I try to make them self-disclose.  Realize their purpose in life.  Yeah, what are you, like a fucking life coach in there?  Yeah, you know, I make...  I'm like Anthony Robbins on steroids. 
[00:12:30]  This could be your first good idea.  I like this one.  Yeah, it's fun.  It's fun.  This is a good idea.  Yeah.  Very cool.  And where do you sleep?  I sleep in their house.  Wait, Sam what?  Guest room.  Sam.  This says that it shot in February 2012.  What?  Well, we've been shooting...  No, we started shooting.  Oh, shit.  And we've been shooting two years.  Two years?  Two years.  What fucking reality show?  Their turnaround is like a week on reality shows.  Well, we do a lot of shows.  Oh, okay.  All right?  You want to get like fucking eight seasons in the can before you roll out that first episode. 
[00:13:00]  No, we've been rolling out.  All right.  Okay.  When is it going to hit TV so we can watch this?  It won't hit TV.  We're doing our own channel.  Oh, I got you.  And it's going to be pay-as-you-go.  What channel?  His Highness channel.  No, YouTube.  His Highness channel.  My own channel.  My own channel.  What's your own channel?  When you want to promote your own channel?  Sam, you don't...  Well, I mean, the only thing is because you shot...  Sure.  ...in February 2012.  Right.  And now...  That's almost... 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, we're pushing a year in...  Two years.  ...nine months at least, right?  Yeah.  Nine months.  We're still shooting.  Still shooting.  And it's going to be on your own channel.  Yes.  You don't really want to promote it, even though we're big radio stars.  I will promote it when we're ready to roll out.  We're not ready.  Is there a possibility that you shot it in February 2012, and then things didn't really  happen with it, and it's actually not going to happen?  No, no.  You know, when I do something, Roberts, unlike yourself, with all due respect, I do it to  the max.  Thank you.  I don't do anything second-rate.  I do it to the best I can and top-notch. 
[00:14:00]  Our phones went out, and we need our phones for the...  Oh, my God.  Those phones are second-rate.  All right.  They might be back.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't do anything second-rate.  No.  What book are you working on?  Anything?  Yeah, it's a book about hockey players, and it's called Dirty Play.  Oh, cool.  And I've interviewed several hundred people for this.  Several hundred?  How do you interview several hundred people?  We've been on for years that we haven't interviewed several hundred.  Well, you know, I have a...  It's amazing.  Whatever happened to your Lady Gaga project?  That did well.  That rolled out. 
[00:14:30]  That did very well.  Sold all over the world.  Could you look up the Lady Gaga project?  Chasing Gaga.  Chasing Gaga.  Okay, here's a Chasing Gaga watch party.  Oh, it aired on the TV Guide channel.  Okay.  And is there, like, a trailer or a clip we could play?  Yeah, play a clip.  Yeah.  Chasing Gaga.  I would like to see some of that.  Now you're going with the hockey players.  Hockey's big in Canada, my friend.  I don't think I've got to tell you.  You would have been able to interview hundreds of people if you did it to the max.  Good point.  Yeah.  Yeah, what did a Frank and a Bill get?  Do you ever...  You know, Robert, Robert's, you know, for a guy with a small dick, you certainly have 
[00:15:00]  a big dick.  Seriously.  You ever relax, Ian, or are you always working?  What do you do?  No, I'm not always working.  I'm very selective in what I get involved in.  You kick back?  Absolutely.  What do you do?  Where do you go?  Where do you go to relax?  What do you do?  I play tennis.  Yeah, but you mean...  Tennis is my yoga.  Is it?  Some guys do yoga.  I've never seen...  Not only a master songwriter and keyboard player, Gaga has staged some of the most significant  and exciting shows in the history of rock music.  Yeah.  My name is Ian Halperin, award-winning celebrity journalist and author. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, you shouldn't say that about yourself.  I've covered Hollywood's biggest stars, including Michael Jackson, Princess Diana, and Elizabeth  Taylor.  But few have had the keyboard rise of Lady Gaga.  I interviewed maybe people close to Gaga since her career took off to get the story.  All right.  This seems like...  I like it.  It seems legit.  It was legit.  They didn't play it in America, but...  It did play in America.  You don't really need a market like America.  I can get that somewhere, right?  We sold it all over the world.  Oh, it's on YouTube?  Yeah, we watch on YouTube.  You know what I love?  I love that goddamn Apple TV.  I put stuff on YouTube on my phone, and then I just go, Apple TV, and there it is on 
[00:16:00]  my 90-inch fucking TV in my goddamn fucking living room.  I'm watching anything.  It's fantastic.  It's like a movie screen.  Yeah, it's great.  Exactly.  Wow.  Jimmy will not let it go.  You know, Anthony, I agree with you on all this, because we're not at the mercy of all  the big corporations anymore.  You know what?  We can take it into our own hands and make money.  Last night, a little story.  I want to watch Gladiator.  Out of nowhere, I just, you know, I like that movie.  I think it's one of the few perfect movies out there. 
[00:16:30]  There's not one moment that's bad in that goddamn movie.  So I wanted to watch it.  So I go to On Demand.  I get it.  And then I realize, when they come out, and that guy's swinging, whoosh, whoosh, the  mace around, and he smacks that guy in the head, and his teeth and blood go flying.  No teeth, no blood.  What?  What the fuck?  They took that out of the movie?  And so I look, and it says, Gladiator, remastered.  Oh, Christ.  I don't know what the fuck that means.  And it's on demand.  So it's fucking remastered.  So I'm like, son of a bitch. 
[00:17:00]  Netflix, bam.  Nothing.  Nothing there.  Why would you do that?  I'm searching all over the place.  Then I finally found a TVD in my house.  The moral of the story is, you don't have to put up with the man anymore.  You don't have to put up with the man anymore.  I don't know why they did that.  And I noticed right away, I'm like, I remember that.  It was right after the guy pisses his fucking pants, and the door opens, and the guy gets  smacked in the head with the fucking mace.  You know what?  And they cut out the fucking blood in Gladiator.  It's the whole point.  You know what, man?  All of us are thinking about throwing our DVDs away. 
[00:17:30]  You got to keep the DVDs.  You never know.  Because they're going to remaster all this shit.  Eventually.  So keep your DVDs if you want to see the original version of the movie.  And, of course, I have three giant stacks.  Of DVDs in the plastic cases.  Right.  Where do you think Gladiator was?  The bottom of the last one I fucking checked.  Always the case.  I'm fucking tooling through.  There's the Matrix.  There's fucking Terminator.  There's Alien. 
[00:18:00]  I'm fucking flipping discs all over the place.  I don't know why you...  Little Beavis is batting him around the house.  Like, knock it off.  Here's my vocabulary, by the way, when I'm home alone.  No, Beavis, no!  Beavis, get down!  Ow!  Ow!  No, Beavis!  No!  Stop it!  It's not as fun.  I am yelling constantly at my little cat.  The terrible twos for your fucking kitten already.  Right?  Ian knows.  Terrible twos, right, Ian?  He doesn't. 
[00:18:30]  From 2 to 17, right?  And he...  Well, you know what?  I think the first four years are tough because the kids are falling all over the place.  You get a little nervous.  Muscular dystrophy is a bitch cakewalk.  Yeah.  Put stuff in their milk, Mason.  How was Montreal, Anthony?  I know you were up in Montreal.  I enjoyed...  I heard you were a big hit there.  You hosted a gala, and they loved you.  It was a lot.  It was so much fun, and the people up there were wonderful.  Delightful.  The city is great.  Smoked pot on the streets.  It's clean. 
[00:19:00]  There's no gibberish.  No gibberish on the street corners.  What do you mean?  It's French and English.  Big fan.  I don't mean that.  Speaking both languages.  Very proper.  Not like fucking here.  Walk down the street.  Did they treat you well?  They like fucking gold.  Please, thank you.  The bartenders were fucking courteous.  Oh, appreciative.  I loved it.  And the chicks?  I gotta tell you.  How were the chicks?  Smoking hot, Ian Halperin.  Smoking hot.  Canadian broads. 
[00:19:30]  Look at Ian.  They are.  I love it.  You're not going to get any complaints out of me.  You're going to go back next summer?  I would love to go back next summer.  You guys are big in Canada.  I know we are.  Huge.  I love it.  We know.  That's why we went.  We're going every year now.  People were beating down doors to get into the show.  Yes.  I have a lot of respect.  This is a different Ian Halperin.  It's a little more subdued.  He's a taken man.  A little more subdued.  I like the wild party guy who comes in here with the drums.  Those days are gone.  Remember when you came in with those chicks?  Remember the chicks that you rented for the day?  Craigslist, you know. 
[00:20:00]  I could have got better models probably on the corner.  Kind of Broadway in 42nd.  But you know what?  You had them.  They were up here.  They were here.  Let me tell you something.  A friend of mine went on Arsenio Hall two weeks ago.  Okay.  And some comedian brought her on.  She was paid as a member of the audience to pop out.  Oh, shit.  You know, they either stole from me or I stole from them.  Wow.  Will Arsenio last this time around?  No.  It doesn't seem like anyone's talking about it. 
[00:20:30]  No one.  I don't even know what the ratings are.  Zero heat.  He seems to do very well at first because I like a talk show.  Yeah, there doesn't seem to be anybody watching.  Just talking over him now.  Is he here for a cup of coffee?  Yeah, he's.  And what he's doing, it's exactly the same thing he was doing in the 90s.  So he hasn't changed anything.  He hasn't updated it.  And the only thing is, he's a little more out of touch now than he was, you know, when  he was a hit black guy.  I don't know anybody. 
[00:21:00]  I honestly don't hear people talking about it.  None.  I don't know.  He might be doing well in the ratings.  I just don't know.  I don't think he is.  I watched Pete Holmes' new show.  How's that?  I liked it.  Pete the Wad Holmes?  Pete Holmes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I liked him.  Yeah, I think that's a good follow-up to Conan.  Yeah, he's on after Conan on TBS.  They had their first show the other day.  You know who's writing for that show?  Joey.  Joe DeRosa.  Joey D.  Sorry, Pete.  What happened?  I'm saying because Joe's writing for him.  Oh.  The Wolverine sketch he did to start it all off was pretty good. 
[00:21:30]  Very clever.  Yeah.  Well written.  Yeah, I liked it.  Very nice.  So far, so good for Pete Holmes.  Was it a half hour or an hour?  Half hour.  Oh, I have it.  Thanks for that.  Is it a half hour?  I think it is.  Wow, that went by.  And how's Fallon going to do in New York?  We love to Fallon.  He'll do great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Him and Kimmel are great with social media and with what's current and in the pop culture.  So they're both really good with that.  So I think we're fine.  Are you going to be a regular on his show?  If you have me, of course.  I've done Fallon before.  He's great.  Yeah.  I think we're team Fallon on this one. 
[00:22:00]  Although they're both very good.  I'm not trashing Kimmel.  Yeah.  I'll do his show again.  But Fallon's been very cool to us over the years.  I think it's a good move to move the show here.  Well, it's hard to say because it's good for Kimmel because he'll be the only L.A.  guy at 1130 was Jays going off the air and fucking, you know, with Fallon staying here,  Kimmel's got the L.A. thing sewn up.  And that's why Carson eventually moved to L.A.  Yeah.  I wonder how it'll affect guests.  He'll get great ones in New York.  Maybe they figure there's more New York guys.  But I think you're going to get Kimmel getting more first movie stars because of where he is. 
[00:22:30]  But do you think there's room for all these guys late night?  It seems there's way too many right now.  It's a bit crowded room.  A bit crowded.  There's so many.  We haven't even talked about Chelsea Handler.  I mean, all these people are coming out with late night shows.  And I think some of them are going to have to disappear.  Well, the amount of channels that there are these days.  And, you know, you can pop shows on everywhere.  They aren't expecting huge runaway numbers anymore because the audiences are so divided. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  If you could be, you know, the big fish in the smaller pond.  Eh, then you're eking out an existence.  You know, I think Pete Holmes will do pretty good.  Mm-hmm.  What about Ferguson?  Huh?  The brother from fucking Clarissa explains it all?  Yeah.  I don't know where he is.  I mean, somebody has to take a hike here.  I like Ferguson, but I don't watch him.  But when I end up watching him, I do enjoy what he does, if that makes any sense.  Who's the best out of all of them?  Which Ferguson do you mean?  I think, um, I think Letterman. 
[00:23:30]  Turd.  Yes.  Turd Ferguson.  I still like Letterman above them all.  Yeah, I agree with you.  You do?  A hundred percent.  Wow.  I think Letterman's a little old on the TV.  Letterman's in a league of his own.  Still does it.  I was there the day Julianne Moore opened up for you guys.  When you guys were on that show, I was in the audience.  You weren't in the audience.  Yes, I was.  Oh, wait.  I think we talked about it.  I was.  Julianne Moore was the first guest.  And then us.  And you guys were second.  You guys had more fans than her.  Julianne Moore.  Outside the studio. 
[00:24:00]  Remember all that?  Outside, there were so many O&A fans.  One and done for us.  I was there with my buddy, David Gavrilchuk.  Oh.  He flew into New York.  Did you sue him, too?  And we used to have tickets to Letterman.  You're not going to sue us, are you?  No.  You guys are.  All right.  You guys are sue-proof.  All the words of the week countdown continues.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's the worst of the week countdown.  I'm Sam Roberts, and this is a highlight of everything good that happened this week on Opie and Anthony. 
[00:24:30]  Still to come, Lady Di making her big return to the show.  Our Lady Di, not Princess Diana.  Brian Regan in studio.  Tim Conway, the legendary Tim Conway in studio.  And Penn Jillette in studio.  A lot, a lot still to get to.  Right now, I want to play for you Nick Offerman, the Parks and Rec celebrity.  You know, show Parks and Recreation.  He's the dude with the mustache.  Ron Swanson.  He builds canoes, and he makes dick jokes.  How many people can say that they do both? 
[00:25:00]  I'll give you one.  Nick Offerman and his mustache in studio here on The Countdown.  Number six.  Nick Offerman has a book.  A very funny guy.  Paddle Your Own Canoe.  It's one man's fundamentals for delicious living.  And what exactly is, because we've just got the book, what exactly is the push-up?  Is it your life story, or is it?  Well, I've been touring a show as a humorist that details my ten tips for prosperity. 
[00:25:30]  There are a number of things I want to say to the young people of our nation who I find to be insufferable often.  Sometimes.  And just things like, say please and thank you.  Put down your phone.  Carry a handkerchief.  A handkerchief.  Use intoxicants, for crying out loud.  And some friends of mine began to say, you know, I like your point of view in your show.  It sounds like it's coming from your book. 
[00:26:00]  And I said, oh, you know, there's a whole bunch of stuff I didn't have time for in my stage show.  So I pitched around a book.  And so it's, you know, it's entertaining.  It's funny.  It's a bunch of stories from my life about what a jackass I am and how I've managed to do okay despite that.  But, you know, there's some allusions to Parks and Rec and my character.  There's a chapter on eating red meat or how to grow manly whiskers, things like that.  Are you a Second City guy?  No, I come from straight theater. 
[00:26:30]  I knew Amy.  There's no such thing.  Quote, unquote.  Quote, unquote.  Forgive me.  Legit theater.  All right.  That's different, sir.  Straight theater with two guys somewhere in the Midwest.  There were seven of us.  But I knew them.  Like, I knew Amy Poehler in the early 90s in Chicago.  But I was at, like, Steppenwolf.  And I had my own theater company called the Defiant Theater. 
[00:27:00]  And we were doing, you know, Sam Shepard plays and Shakespeare.  We'd do a Shakespeare play.  But we'd do Hamlet.  But Claudius would be like a cocaine king.  And it would be full of, like, Ice-T and NWA songs.  So I come from theater.  And then only in my 30s did I start working at the Upright Citizens Brigade.  Because I realized nobody, if you come from, quote, unquote, straight theater, people think you should be in drama.  And they don't think you're funny because you didn't go to comedy school. 
[00:27:30]  And so I said, well, I better go over to the comedy school and start smoking on the playground with those kids.  Right on.  Sam Shepard was his, I just, by the way,  I fucking went to open up a pen and click.  The wrong way.  And I clicked the pointy end.  I feel like I got him shot.  I hate that.  The, uh, Sam Shepard, did he do a play  where he plays, the woman's name is May?  Oh, fuck.  Something about May.  Yeah.  There was a woman named May. 
[00:28:00]  I'm only thinking because I...  Something about May.  Yeah, he masturbated onto his face.  Oh, yes.  Onto every month but that one.  No, it was, uh, I think, it was the worst thing I ever did was a scene in acting class.  I think it was a Sam Shepard play.  Yeah.  Oh!  It was an...  Why did they pick that one?  I don't know.  It was just me.  I was terrible.  What are the names of some of his plays?  Oh, Buried Child, Fool for Love.  It was Fool for Love.  Michelle Pfeiffer did the movie, right?  That sounds right.  Okay, yeah.  Oh, I did a scene out of Fool for Love.  It was brutal.  The only thing I know about Sam Shepard is he was in The Right Stuff. 
[00:28:30]  He certainly was.  He's a great actor.  He was a great actor in that.  That was great.  He was the Chuck Yeager character.  He was.  Yeah, he's in a great movie coming out.  A buddy of mine wrote August Osage County.  He plays a great role in that.  It was a Pulitzer Prize winning play a few years ago here in town.  He's what you call stoic.  Yes.  Yeah.  What does that mean?  With a granite visage.  Yes, yes. 
[00:29:00]  Okay.  All right.  I got some words to look up when I get home.  You see?  Old Saddle Face.  Old Saddle Face.  Which is something I aspire to.  I hope to be around that long.  I got to ask you about Parks and Rec.  It's on hiatus.  What's that about?  Well, that's a bit of an embellishment by the muckrakers over at the Huffington Post.  Oh, boy.  NBC is trying to figure out who to put in the game and strategize how to get ahead here 
[00:29:30]  one of these days.  And so they put us on the bench for like two weeks.  Oh, okay.  It's something that they do all the time where they're like, you know what?  Let's try and up this show's numbers by putting the voice in front of it.  Right, right.  And so we just sat down for a minute.  All right.  That's way different.  Not going anywhere.  It is, yeah.  I think we're going to get to finish the season.  Is that show completely scripted?  Jesus.  Or is it, because Amy's a brilliant improver. 
[00:30:00]  I've seen her work, and she's one of the greatest I've ever seen.  She's like a crazy comedy machine.  You put a quarter in her, and she'll crank out a seven-part series.  It's like harassment.  It's unbelievable.  Put a quarter in her.  It's terrible.  I kind of like this.  Right.  A 50-cent piece.  Oh, right.  It is entirely scripted.  Our writers, a room of writers led by Mike Schur, who comes from SNL, and then The Office. 
[00:30:30]  They're brilliant.  So we never need to make up a thing.  But because we have people like Amy, we can shoot the incredible script and then say,  okay, now what do you got?  And then we screw around and find some other gold.  And how much of that stuff makes the show?  Probably, I'd say, three or four moments a show.  You shoot a scene where it comes around to me, and I have a punchline, like, please don't touch my axe.  And then I take five through seven. 
[00:31:00]  I'll say, please don't touch my firewood implement, or whatever the BS is.  And once in a while, it's funny.  With the others, quite frequently, it's funny.  And sometimes they keep it in the show.  And what is your play about, or your stage show?  It's something I've often aspired to do, is play the guitar and entertain people where they let me finish.  I never even remotely came close to it. 
[00:31:30]  But then I realized if I can get them laughing, they don't care how terrible my guitar playing is.  So, it's a bunch of funny songs with all these anecdotes of, you know, here's a story about me being a complete idiot when I was a teenager.  Interspersed, sort of dovetailed in with these lessons of, you know, say please and thank you, don't look in the mirror.  That's a big one.  Don't look in the mirror. 
[00:32:00]  Avoid the mirror.  Yeah, that's the key to a great self-image.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, because you'll kind of be down on yourself.  All the channels, all the commercials keep telling me I should look like Keira Knightley.  And I feel good about that inside, and I mince about the sidewalk, feeling beautiful.  And it works well unless I look in the mirror and see, oh, Jesus.  Makes sense.  This is not cutting it.  You're one of the few guys that really makes a mustache work in this day and age. 
[00:32:30]  I appreciate it.  It works for you.  How long have you had the mustache?  Well, I'm a character actor, so it's one of the tools in my box.  I love to pull it out when I'm playing a cop or a thug or whatnot.  I guess I've had a pretty full, you know, set of facial bracken since I was about 20 or 19.  But I don't, you know, I don't go for one look.  So I'm looking forward when my show's over to put it away for a while.  Oh, okay, I got you.  Do you get sick of it? 
[00:33:00]  I don't mind it.  Usually I've never been on a series like this before, so usually I look really different every three months.  And that's fun.  It's like a Lon Chaney lifestyle.  Well, who are you?  You know, I like to be unrecognizable.  I've found a way to do that in 20 years of stand-up.  But now I'm ready to have the disguise of my clean-shaven face.  What do you mean Lon Chaney? 
[00:33:30]  Did he switch up the way his look all the time?  Yeah, well, he was the guy who played sort of every different monster.  And he was an early film makeup genius.  He used to, when he had to make his eyes look blind, he would cut out that filament from a hard-boiled egg between the egg and the shell.  Oh, shit.  And lay a piece of that over his eye, which I've tried.  Wow.  It's quite difficult.  I would gather.  You actually tried that.  I did, because I was broke, and I said, well, Lon Chaney did this. 
[00:34:00]  And I talked to a guy whose dad did makeup with Lon Chaney years later, and he was like, oh, well, there's a whole bunch of other shit you've got to do to it.  You can't just lay that.  You don't just stick it in your eye.  Yeah.  You're so good in vinegar, and, you know.  Got to fog it up, I guess, or something.  Un-goop it.  But doesn't it come apart, or how do you take it out?  Like a lens is solid.  Contact lens is solid.  It's the taking it out.  I couldn't answer, because I never quite got it in.  But it's like a fabric.  It's like that filament-y skin that pulls out from the inside of the shell. 
[00:34:30]  And he thought to put that on his eyes to look blind.  That's pretty smart.  Yeah.  It's amazing now that it's just so easy to do.  They just throw a contact lens at you, and fucking you're done.  Yeah.  Which is what I ended up having to do.  I was like, oh, that was a day of pain.  How much are those white contact lenses?  Why'd you want to look blind?  It was for a film, an independent film that didn't have any budget.  And I was like, oh, I'll take care of the blind eye.  Yeah, I got the blind stuff.  Don't worry about it.  I got it, guys. 
[00:35:00]  I'm on it.  I got some eggs.  But you know who did a good job of looking blind in The Scent of a Woman?  Like, there was something about it.  It didn't look like, it just looked like he was kind of not seeing anybody.  And I'm like, what a talent that is to...  Yeah, some people can't pull that off when they're playing blind people.  But it sounds stupid and simple, but to be able to look at somebody but not see them  and look like you're not seeing them is pretty fucking impressive.  Especially when you have to act with somebody.  Yeah.  That would be a little hard to do.  That's the thing is, in the case of Al Pacino, you can be good at acting.  I, unfortunately, had to try and stick an egg in my face to pull it off. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, it's a little different.  Is it hard to go from...  Because this format of Parks and Rec is, you know, again, it's a different feel.  It feels like a documentary-style comedy.  And then to kind of go back to straight comedy after that or what's more traditional probably  isn't as fun.  It's different.  I mean, I come from the stage and my wife and I did a play this year, which we're actually  bringing to New York next year, called Annapurna, which is... 
[00:36:00]  It's really a lot of fun.  It's a comedy, but then it gets really dramatic.  It's a really great piece of writing.  And that's our first love.  And I guess in the theater, you do what's ever in the season.  So maybe you're doing, like, The Death of a Salesman, and then you turn around and do  some wacky...  You can go do The Book of Mormon or something.  And so it's kind of fun to switch up disciplines.  We do get spoiled on my show because of the documentary style and everything's handheld. 
[00:36:30]  We don't have a lot of marks like you do in a film.  And you can basically be sloppier and lazier.  And so then you go back and work on a film and they're like, no, Nick, we need you to  please do the same thing every time.  And you're like, oh, yeah, I forgot.  They let me do whatever I want over at our hilarious Chuckle Fest.  Yeah, but it's got to be nice just to fucking kind of...  It's got to be freeing.  Yeah, being on the mark sucks.  It is many scenes.  Like, if we were shooting this right now, they'd be shooting through the windows, so 
[00:37:00]  there'd be no cameras in here.  And so you become much more relaxed and natural.  And I never do this unless I'm the last one.  The worst, though, is when you think you're doing it right and they're like, all right,  we've got to stop because you're in the wrong place.  Oh, no.  What do you think?  Like, oh, man, I'm brilliant here.  This is great.  One of my best performances.  This is the one.  Yeah, that ain't going to work.  It's like, oh, I have no sense.  I have no sense of what works or doesn't work.  Do you get scared when you act at all?  I get nervous.  I don't. 
[00:37:30]  My first gig was as an altar boy at the Catholic Church in my hometown, which I believe is on  page 29.  And that was when I learned, I started, you have these glass containers called cruets.  One has water and one has wine.  And the priest mixes them as part of the ceremony.  And he somehow magically turns it into the blood of Jesus.  And then he drinks it.  And invariably, I served under several priests. 
[00:38:00]  And they all really humorously, it's like a Mel Brooks scene, take the wine and then go  glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug.  There you go.  And they take the water and go bloop.  All right.  That's an equal mixture.  That's all you need.  And I started reviewing the wine with facial expressions for the crowd.  You know, so I'd be standing there and I'd take a whiff of the wine and kind of shake  my head and make a frowny face.  Or sometimes I'd say, pleasing bouquet, tinged with just a hint of regret. 
[00:38:30]  And my dad took me aside and was like, this is not the place to entertain the audience.  This is the congregation.  But I said, oh, OK, then I guess I need to find a place where people enjoy my mugging.  More than church.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No issues at church?  Yeah, I know.  As soon as you're altar boy, you've got to ask.  You automatically think it's...  No, it's true.  I, no, I escaped unscathed.  We had a good bunch of guys. 
[00:39:00]  But it was always really scary to hear all the stories.  Oof.  You're like, hmm.  I never hear any stories from anybody in real life, so I'm assuming a lot of people are  lying.  That's what I assume.  It's like, anything happen to you?  No.  No, no.  We had a great trip.  And meanwhile, like, as he's saying that, in his head is just this horror movie is playing  in the House of Hearts.  Yeah, it's like House of Hearts.  Going back to the House of Hearts thing.  It's playing in his mind.  I'm perfectly well-adjusted.  I love my Cub Scouts.  Are you willing to take a lie? 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, nothing happened.  The fact that I wake up screaming every night, there's nothing to do with that.  A lot of people get night terrors.  A lot of people finger their dogs.  Leave me alone.  It could happen.  You a married man, are you?  I am.  I'm happily married.  I've been with my wife for 14 years.  The great Megan Mullally.  Did you say wife of 14 years?  Yes.  We've been together for 14.  We just had our 10th anniversary. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, dating for four.  Yeah.  I was making an underage girl joke.  My wife of 14 years didn't really go over.  She's terrific.  Yeah.  You put a quarter in her.  That quarter is very handy with women.  And she's in theater with you?  Oh, great.  Yeah.  She's done Broadway shows.  She was in Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein, which is one of the greatest things I've ever 
[00:40:30]  seen.  Who was she in that?  The Madeline Kahn part.  Elizabeth.  Oh, not at all.  The Madeline Kahn part.  I thought he meant in the movie.  Yeah.  No, no.  The musical.  They did a Broadway musical.  The musical, yeah.  I was going to go, wow, you're older.  You were married to Madeline Kahn.  What happened?  Yeah.  It didn't work out.  And she does a little Parks and Rec, a little bit.  She does, yeah.  She works on my show.  She does.  As your ex?  She does all kinds of stuff.  She has an amazing new band called Nancy and Beth.  We were just analyzing it last night because it's, they do old fashioned, like kick ass 
[00:41:00]  blues and rock songs that are a little more obscure, but they add the production value of  like a Beyonce show.  So she and her friend Stephanie Hunt, they do all this super sexy, intense choreography.  It's like an old Tina Turner kind of show.  And it's just something nobody does anymore.  Like we've all become so lazy that we sit on a stool and play a mandolin and sing to you  about coffee.  Appreciate me. 
[00:41:30]  But yeah, they're called Nancy and Beth.  They're super, a lot of fun.  And I guest for them a lot.  I perform a couple of different rap songs for them.  Really?  We do hits from the bong and, uh, smell yo dick by risque.  So there's some mirth of that one.  There's some mirth in the show.  Oh, that's a real song.  It is.  Smell yo dick.  It's incredible.  Oh yeah, yeah.  I've heard it before.  Sure.  Yeah.  Sam's played it.  What do you think of the passing of Lou Reed?  Everyone's talking about Lou Reed today.  Well, I, I doffed my cap. 
[00:42:00]  I mean, I, uh, I'm, I'm also a really big fan of a very close friend of his, Laurie  Anderson.  And you're a big fan.  Oh God.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Okay.  She was a weirdo.  Hold on though.  It's a weirdo.  We started our show because they married in 2008.  I did not know that.  And then we played Oh Superman.  Cause that's the only thing we know.  Why are you a big fan?  We don't get it.  She's a performance artist.  Obviously she is.  Yeah.  But explain Laurie Anderson to us.  Well, she, to me, I mean, she's off the charts smart. 
[00:42:30]  And so I, I, I feel daunted trying to like, like explain Stephen Hawking to me.  Ah, yeah.  But she, uh, what makes her so brilliant?  Well, you put a quarter in her.  She, uh, she, uh, she is a storyteller, um, who takes her stories and, uh, performs them  in a, in a really innovative way.  She also plays the violin.  So I, I used to see her live in the eighties and nineties.  And she, she just puts on a really trippy, cool shows using sound and, and visual. 
[00:43:00]  Um, and so they're like these little theater pieces just rife with great ideas.  So she's a progressive thinker.  You know, she, she does an amazing job of making fun of society.  I mean, in Oh Superman, there's that bit about, uh, hello, this is your mom.  I mean, she, she takes, uh, sort of hilarious human dogma and points it back up to us to  make us laugh at ourselves.  But her shows were the greatest. 
[00:43:30]  I mean, if you like Pink Floyd, the wall or any kind of like intense visual kick-ass rock  show, it was sort of like that at a library.  I'm a huge fan of hers.  And that, and that made me, I love Lou Reed as well.  And then when they hooked up, I was like, fantastic.  Wow.  There you go.  Please run our country.  We got, we got, we got our answer finally.  Yeah.  That's how we started the show.  I don't know.  I'm still too shallow to, uh, appreciate it.  Yeah.  It's not for everyone.  I'm sure.  You know, you know, it sounds good to me, uh, Swedish super group ABBA. 
[00:44:00]  They also have their place in the Pantheon.  Exactly.  Well, she, she, she's also really funny.  Um, and I, maybe, I don't know.  Didn't come across in that Superman video.  Well, this, the Superman thing is weird because, um, when, uh, when 9-11 happened, that, that  song resurfaced because it had all of these prescient lines of here come the planes.  Oh, okay.  The American planes.  Oh, so you got some conspiracy theorists going, look at this. 
[00:44:30]  I think, I, I think that the Bush administration may have been Laurie Anderson fans as well.  Oh, so they listened to it and then perpetrated, uh, that.  Or at least the Velvet Underground.  So Jesse Ventura could then explain it to everybody.  All right.  Apparently, uh, W loved to crank up Sweet Jane when he was going on a night mission.  When he was partying.  Over Tuscaloosa.  You've got a very unique voice, man.  I was just, I'm hearing Kristen Bell from American Psycho. 
[00:45:00]  Really?  And then to go really obscure, Dave Rabbit, the, the Vietnam joke.  Look what I wrote down.  Whoa.  What?  I wrote down Dave Rabbit.  Dave Rabbit?  I was going to point out that Nick sounded like him and I didn't want to forget.  Dave Rabbit.  Exactly.  We, there's, uh, some Vietnam tapes of this guy that used to just, you know, be a DJ over  there during the shit.  And, uh, I don't know, they became quite popular on our show.  You sound exactly like him.  And a little Kristen Bell, no?  From American Psycho?  Or, or is that a stretch?  No, I wasn't really picking that up.  I've actually heard that a lot, which is. 
[00:45:30]  American Psycho?  It is.  All right, thank you.  It's a very funny, and I don't, it's such a funny thing to be like, you know, you have  a really, you sound exactly like American Psycho.  Yeah, you know why?  That's not, you're right.  You sound like a rapist.  Yeah.  That's the case.  I hear also, um, and I'm not super familiar with, I guess, their, their normal speaking  voices, but drivers often say, when they don't see me, they say, if I, if I didn't know it  was you, I would swear I had Charlie Sheen in the back of my car. 
[00:46:00]  Or, oh yeah, there is a Charlie Sheen thing.  And also, sometimes Nicholas Cage.  Yes, I hear a little Nicholas Cage.  We had him.  Well, Jimmy would know.  Jimmy sat down on a flight with Nicholas Cage and had a little conversation with him.  Let's hear about that.  Well, could you, could you, could you, could you once in a six hour period go, huh?  That's all I need from you.  He wasn't, he wasn't very talkative with Jimmy, and Jimmy wanted to be talkative with him,  and it was embarrassing.  Oh, you want to hear Dave Rabbit, who we really think is in the light? 
[00:46:30]  Sure, please.  All right, E-Rock.  Sorry about that yelling and screaming, but Pete and I are on a trip, and we thought we'd  have to get in on that song.  Wow.  He's got a glottal fry going on.  Yeah.  Three Dog Night is called Mama Told Me Not to Come, and you can take this two ways.  As a title, or your girlfriend's name is Mama. 
[00:47:00]  I like it.  He passed recently.  Yeah, he just died.  Those were all like, uh, like, he was amazing.  What, he hijacked the signal and fucking broadcast, right?  Oh, yeah, it was all illegal broadcast, and there's not much, uh, if anyone else has audio  of that guy, I would love to hear it.  We only got, I don't know, one show or something of the guy.  There's definitely something that, he had a little more of that gritty, grainy, gravelly  thing.  He had that good Vietnam shit.  Yeah, yeah, you know, it does.  It sounds like he's talking while he's still holding in a hit. 
[00:47:30]  That's, uh, that's some good fucking nom shit.  Well, that's what those guys would do, though.  They would do a hit and then just start talking.  Uh, well, uh, exhale as they went.  Yeah, yeah.  That was back when, uh, if, if, during this radio interview, we would have tons of Marlboro  Reds and Giants in this room.  Oh, yeah.  And not think twice about it.  Not even.  Now we only have three.  I, I, I, I love watching old movies like that, too.  I was watching something, uh, an episode of Columbo or something, and I loved that dumb 
[00:48:00]  show, and, uh, they had a scene inside an airplane, and there was just people smoking  and people just walking through the gates into the plane with not an ounce of security.  Oh, that's crazy.  You kind of remember that shit, though.  I love the notion, uh, the first major commercial flight I took, I, I went from my farm town in  Illinois to the University of Illinois and ended up in this Kabuki theater play, which  we were suddenly going to take to Japan.  So that was my first big flight, was nonstop Chicago, Tokyo. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, wow.  Okay.  And we were, it was 1991, we were like 21 years old, and we got on this huge jumbo jet,  and just behind row 17 was the smoking section.  Yeah, yeah.  In hindsight, it's so idiotic.  Yeah.  You're in a huge soup can, and they're like, everybody below one-third can smoke.  Unless they've invented the force field, you are not, uh, going to be in a smoke freezer.  I mean, please don't smoke.  Like the dumb restaurants where there are non-smoking areas. 
[00:49:00]  What the hell?  Did it stink the whole flight?  It was horrible.  Of course.  I never flew on a smoking flight.  Come on, Jimmy.  Never in my life.  I took one trip to Seattle in like 1990.  When did the smoking stop, though?  I don't know.  It was a continental flight.  It was international flights.  It stopped, uh, later.  Japan Airlines is one of the last, if you took, if you took Japan Airlines, it was one of the  last ones to stop it.  Oh, yeah.  They love smoking.  Japanese people, you sit at a blackjack table in Atlantic City.  You know.  With Japanese people, you can't even see the cards. 
[00:49:30]  It's just like you're encased in smoke.  You know, Jimmy might be right.  I just assumed I was on a flight where they were smoking.  Never remember.  No, I don't think.  All right.  Sporting events, of course.  I remember that, though.  Holy shit.  And concerts.  My God.  I remember I was, like, 12 years old.  I'm on a plane going to L.A. and just smoke everywhere.  It's how they allowed people to just have little flaming objects in the plane.  Yeah.  It just seems so odd now that for safety reasons.  In a vehicle that's carrying a huge amount of oxygen. 
[00:50:00]  Oxygen and fuel.  And, yeah, yeah.  And there you go.  Everyone, have a lighter.  Light up.  And they're worried about our dumb cell phones.  Our cell phones.  Yeah.  Right.  What do you like that?  Please remove your shoes.  Right.  Yeah, he used to smart.  Turn your cell phones off.  What?  You know what we used to do up here?  This is fire in our seats.  This is crazy.  We were pinching stewardesses' asses.  It's all nonsense.  Well, not a 12.  Oh, man.  Well, I say good luck with the book, Nick.  Have we sold it properly? 
[00:50:30]  I don't even know.  It's called Paddle Your Own Canoe.  Yeah.  And it's Nick Offerman.  And it's got some true stories in there and some life advice.  And some humorous illustrations by a very funny guy named Mike Mitchell.  Including some illustrations of me performing breakdance moves.  Oh.  Also, some acceptable and unacceptable versions of facial hair.  I'm right on that page.  Look at that.  Including, when I first met Harry Connick Jr., when he was working on Will & Grace, I had a goatee.  Very funny, hilarious, talented guy. 
[00:51:00]  And I met him.  You know, hi, this is Nick.  Hey, how you doing?  And he pulled me in with a handshake and said, where I come from, we call that a prison pussy.  And I said, I think you and I are going to get along.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Yeah, he is so funny.  Oh, the douchebag.  I think you got this down.  I'm looking at the illustrations.  The douchebag.  Yeah.  The douchebag.  The nut smudge. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  The joke.  I think you figured out the facial hair.  Are you doing your signings?  I am, yeah.  I've been doing, it's weird, it's a whole new medium, the book.  The book.  Turns out, yeah.  The stuff, they're putting it out on paper now.  It's amazing.  And it's rather permanent.  It's funny, because you tell jokes, you tell stories, and there's something ephemeral to it.  Nowadays, it exists forever on the internet, but still, you listen to it and it's gone. 
[00:52:00]  But when it's written on paper in the library, people take it seriously in a different way.  Or maybe you get a different breed of nerd in the line, and I say nerd lovingly, counting  myself amongst their number, but they're like, I've memorized your book, and there's  a few things I wanted to talk to you about behind the building.  And you're like, well, hang on, I'll be right there.  Yeah, the creepy ones.  Right before the bullet enters your side.  That's right.  Yeah, well, way to end it on a fun note. 
[00:52:30]  No problem.  Nick's signing is going to be like the fucking end of talk radio.  If you enjoy my book, you're a dead fucker.

And we are counting down the very worst, meaning best bits, that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm Sam Roberts. 
[00:57:30]  You know me from the Opie and Anthony show.  And after Opie and Anthony live, I've got my own show, the Sam Roberts show, which airs Sunday here on the Opie and Anthony channel at 4 p.m.  Eastern, Jessica Lange from American Horror Story.

Still to come today on The Countdown, we're going to have Tim Conway in studio, the return of Lady Di, Penn Jillette in studio, Brian Regan in studio. 
[00:58:00]  But right now, I want to get to the coverage of current events, the passing of Lou Reed.  Lou Reed died this week or last week.  I don't know.  We covered it this week on the Opie and Anthony show.  Lou Reed passed away, and the music world mourned, and it was all over the morning news.  And ONA, they don't really get Lou Reed. 
[00:58:30]  They don't really understand what the big deal is.  So we tried to figure it out.  We got Black Earl, an old-time friend of the show, to try to break it down for us.  Maybe not as intelligently as he could have, but still, he made a try.  It's Black Earl covering the death of Lou Reed here on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  What's Earl's tweet?  You got to do the first one, where he's going to have, all right, yeah, you know which one?  Yeah, it's just so pretentious, because he is really acting like he's the Twitter account for New Yorkers to follow. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, here it is.  R.I.P. Lou Reed.  We'll have more later.  Lost for words right now.  He's always lost for words.  And by the way, he's not lost for words.  That's another one of those dumb things.  Right.  You have nothing to say.  Lost for words.  That's poignant.  That you're so grief-stricken, you're at a loss for words.  You can't even speak.  Yeah.  You didn't know the guy personally.  How would you be lost for words? 
[00:59:30]  And we'll have more later, as if you're the news source.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I better check in with Earl.  How many hours did he need for the next tweet about Lou Reed?  He really thought it over.  How long were his words fucking gone for?  Well, the first one was 16 hours ago.  Okay.  Then he followed that up 16 hours ago.  Wait, I thought he was a little lost for words.  He found them real quick.  He found some words.  So, within the same hour, he found words?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Thank God.  And what was that?  One of the best songs written ever. 
[01:00:00]  Ever.  About New York.  Love you, Lou.  You've earned your rest.  No one wants to earn their rest.  Ew.  You want to earn your rest if you're able to wake up at some point.  Yeah, of course.  Fuck.  Love you, Lou.  Love you, Lou.  You've earned your rest.  Earned your rest?  You think Lou's fucking reading Twitter?  Reading Earl's Twitter?  Oh, good.  That's like saying it's Jim Norton-ing.  Stop romanticizing death. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Earned your rest.  Oh, you just tuckered out?  Right.  From not singing?  Yes, he's reading Twitter and then saying,  Oh, good.  Earl Douglas loved me.  Earl says I could fucking relax now.  Sweet, Jane.  What song did he mean was one of the best songs written ever about New York?  NYC Man.  Oh, God.  I never heard that.  Do you have that?  Sure.  Let's hear it.  Oh, this was another song about New York?  What Earl says is a...  How long is this piece of shit?  What year is this? 
[01:01:00]  It's from his 1996 album.  Oh, wow.  Okay, I remember it's different.  It's a newer song.  I decided to walk the streets of New York again.  Yeah.  To see things we can't possibly have seen ourselves.  Of course not.  Get ready to be enlightened about New York.  All right.  This is some jazz shit right here.  You like jazz.  I love it.  It's my favorite type of music.  Okay.  It can only lead to trouble if you break my heart. 
[01:01:30]  You accidentally crush it on the ice of March.  I prefer you watch straight forward.  You don't have to go through all of that.  I'm a New York City man, baby.  Say go and that is that.  New York City man.  You just say go and that is that. 
[01:02:00]  I'm a New York City man.  You just say go and that is that.  You just say go and that is that.  Earl's an idiot.  How does Earl say this is the best song about New York City? 
[01:02:30]  New York that was ever, ever written, ever.  It's not.  Yeah, yeah.  New York State of Mind.  Billy Joel.  New York, New York.  New York. 
[01:03:00]  Come on.  There's plenty of New York songs that.  This isn't even the top million.  You know, it's in a mood if he's preferring a Jay-Z song.  It's not Jay-Z's version I like.  Oh.  This is not the best song about New York ever.  Alicia Keys is singing.  This isn't even close.  Look, he's all over the TV.  We got Black Earl on the line.  Our old pal.  What's up, Earl?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Well, we're all mourning the passing of Lou Reed. 
[01:03:30]  The untimely passing.  The untimely passing of Lou Reed.  And I know you were a big Lou Reed fan.  You could tell by the Twitter.  Yep.  Yeah.  Loved the ass.  Loved, loved, loved.  What did you like about him?  Just really, he was the street.  He was the street to the core, man.  Yeah, man.  True that.  How is he street?  I don't know what that means. 
[01:04:00]  He was like part of the New York City fabric, right, Earl?  Oh, yeah.  He was New York.  Uh-huh.  When you think New York, you think Lou Reed.  Well, he's also, you know, he brought a real sense of realism to the music.  Absolutely.  Explain that further.  The music was real.  I mean, think of it.  Before Lou Reed, you didn't have really, like, really deep songs about drugs, about... 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, Rolling Stones weren't into that at all.  Yeah, Dad neither.  But you liked his, you liked lyrically what he did.  He really delved into that drug culture like no one else.  Yeah.  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah.  Earl?  Hello, Dad.  No, you'll bring it up for a second.  See, that's one of the things he does. 
[01:05:00]  I have a million phone calls where Earl goes, you're bringing up.  Nothing changing.  Earl.  It's been years.  He really tackled the drug culture in his songs.  I said, explain that further, please.  Thanks.  Think about a song like heroin.  Think about a song like waiting for the man.  I'm thinking about, just trying to think of something else off the top of my head.  Well, we're thinking about it.  Well, even, you know, Walk on the Wild Side, obviously.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  I never heard that.  There was some drug action in that song as well.  And what about New York Man?  Oh, New York City Man, I think it's the best song written about New York.  Why is it the best song written about New York, in your words?  A lot of New York songs out there.  Yep.  Well, just, you know, first of all, it's a fantastic song.  It's just a...  What makes it a fantastic song? 
[01:06:00]  Earl, what makes it a fantastic song?  You can't just say it's a fantastic song.  What makes it a fantastic song?  Earl.  Earl.  Comment.  Earl.  Earl.  Hello.  Earl, what are you doing?  Earl. 
[01:06:30]  Earl, we know you're still there.  What's going on?  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl, hello.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  He didn't hang up.  Maybe someone sprayed some Febreze and he passed out.  Like those sheep.  Earl.  The sleeping sheep.  Can we call Earl?  Earl.  Remember, he used to just pass out. 
[01:07:00]  Yes.  Earl.  Can we call Earl back?  And now he hangs up.  He's at a lost four.  He is at a lost four.  Always the second question that always has gotten him.  Throws him.  That's why I was laughing so much because you go, okay, you like Lou Reed.  Yes.  Well, what song?  Well, I mean, you know, even take a walk on the wild side.  Well, why?  You're breaking up.  He's great. 
[01:07:30]  He reiterates the same thing he said in his Twitter.  Yeah, it's the best.  Here comes Earl.  All right.  Make him believe that he couldn't hear us.  Earl.  Earl Lee.  Yo.  Why is that a great song about New York?  Great song about New York?  It's very literate.  It has, you know, historical references, both in literature.  What historical references?  Quotes, you know, Shakespeare.  Quotes. 
[01:08:00]  Shakespeare is, of course, a grand New Yorker.  Yeah, wouldn't that be a great Shakespeare song then?  What makes it such a great New York song?  Because there's a lot of songs that have been written about New York over the years.  Well, I understand that.  But I don't know.  I like the feel of it.  I like the energy of it.  It's kind of different for Lou because it was kind of a laid back song.  Almost sentimental because he was hardly sentimental.  What do you mean about sentimental? 
[01:08:30]  The fact that he was born in Brooklyn and he's singing about New York City?  Well, no, that's sentimental in the sense that, let's see, like...  Earl, your Twitter said you're a huge Lou Reed fan.  Yes, I'm a huge Lou Reed fan.  I went to the book two and a half hours ago, so I'm not sharp as the name right now.  Up just reflecting?  A little self-reflection? 
[01:09:00]  Still a little too emotional right now?  Lost for words.  Lost for words.  The old loss for words?  Yeah, well, you know, that was great.  It must be great to live your life with that moniker.  I'm at a loss for words.  Lost for words.  You're going to be on with Ronnie today?  Talk a little about Lou?  Yeah, I hope so.  I'd like to hear that.  Yeah, I mean, I know he's very upset about it.  Have you spoken to him? 
[01:09:30]  Not yet, no.  So how do you know he's very upset about it?  Um, he's as big a fan as I was.  Why do I find that hard to believe?  And you're a huge fan.  He doesn't know at all.  Hmm.  Big Lou Reed fan on the phone.  Earl Douglas.  Oh, I got one, because this is one thing we discussed earlier we don't understand. 
[01:10:00]  Like, a lot of people say that Lou Reed was very influential in their careers.  Mm-hmm.  Why is that?  Go.  Well, influential in the sense that, you know, he brought an avant-garde sense to the music.  He brought, again, brought realism to lyrics.  On top of everything else, fantastic guitar player, too.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  How about the singing?  Singing?  Um, well, you didn't, you know, like Dylan, you didn't necessarily have to be a virtuoso 
[01:10:30]  to be a fantastic singer.  That's true.  Dylan, though, I at least sang.  Dylan did do a lot of singing.  Lou Reed kind of talks things.  Hmm.  Yeah, he kind of...  More talks.  Yeah, it was like more talking, but it was also...  Like, what we're doing right now could be a Lou Reed song.  Right.  Wow.  Very good, Jimmy.  You know, he just brought this kind of... 
[01:11:00]  It was almost...  It wasn't quite spoken word, but it was also very rock and roll in the sense that, you  know, it kept it simple.  It was always two guitars, bass drums, not a lot of chord changes.  Uh-huh.  But the thing is, now, Earl, I've heard Lou Reed...  Everyone's talking about him today.  God bless.  Um, but I've heard Lou Reed described as, like, the godfather of, uh, punk.  Right.  Of punk.  I don't really...  If I listen to any of his songs, even the live versions, I'm not hearing much punk-sounding, 
[01:11:30]  uh, music there.  How is that, uh...  How was that title given to him?  Well, he sang about trannies, so that's kind of punk-ish.  Well...  No one else was singing about trannies, right?  I'm not feeling like, you know, when you listen to something like, uh, the Dead Kennedys,  things like that, even the Clash, you know?  Maybe it wasn't the punk sound, it maybe it was the, uh...  Well, Earl, why don't you explain?  No, well, we could do it now like rock and roll animals.  Sure.  Sex Pistols.  You know, we kind of used stuff over the Velvet Underground classics.  But, uh, we were listening to some of that. 
[01:12:00]  We were actually listening to Sweet Jane off of that album, and, uh, though I found the  music very, uh, interesting and very, uh, good and melodic, uh, again, not much punk  sound there.  Well, I don't know if it was punk in sound as much as punk in attitude.  Volume.  They did.  Keeping it simple.  Loud.  Punk wasn't known to keep it really simple.  No, I, I kind of like, you know, when you're getting a brick punk, you know...  Right.  Thrown at you. 
[01:12:30]  I'm thinking...  I don't know if that's simple.  Uh, fucking safety pins through the cheeks and fucking...  Yeah, I don't know if that's keeping it simple.  You know, fucking Sex Pistols.  You're talking attitude.  I mean, as far as musical approach.  Right.  Most punk bands, probably some of the first songs they learned were Velvet Underground songs.  So they're very basic to learn.  They would go, you know, they would be one or two chords.  What's a big Velvet Underground song, Earl?  Um, obviously Sweet Jane, White, White, White Heat, Waiting for the Man, Ben Fatale, Venus and 
[01:13:00]  Furs.  Right.  Lou...  Pale Blue Eyes.  Earl, you're doing Lou Reed proud today.  There's one other thing.  Uh, people are talking today about how he, you know, didn't give a crap about commercial success.  You want to discuss that a little bit with comment, Earl?  A little bit today?  Well, he didn't necessarily adhere to trends.  He didn't have to, you know, there wasn't no dance remixes.  There weren't any Lou Reed disco songs.  There weren't any Lou Reed, you know, bubblegum pop. 
[01:13:30]  He kind of followed this, his own path.  That sort of trailblazer does.  Played his own path.  Unless he's selling, uh, Honda scooters.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Yeah, but, you know what, though?  At the time, even that was kind of, it was Lou Reed.  Because Lou Reed isn't silly.  Uh-oh.  There he is.  Lending his, uh, this is the epitome of selling out, by the way.  This is punk right here. 
[01:14:00]  Using your...  Like a dance remix a little bit?  Using your hit song to sell some corporate project.  Man.  We're fine.  Hey, don't settle for walking.  Oh.  Oh, he's sitting on a scooter.  Hey, don't settle for walking.  There's a guy that didn't want commercials, or didn't care about commercial success.  Oh.  But used my hit song to sell Honda scooters. 
[01:14:30]  A couple of bucks.  They're probably offering him a lot of money right there.  Right.  You know?  Since he saw how much he was going to make, oh, he gave a shit.  Exactly.  All those fucking punk principles go out the fucking window.  Blaze that trail on a Honda scooter.  Right.  Why did he tell the man to go fuck himself, Earl?  Hey, but look at it this way.  Johnny Rotten sold butter.  You know?  How many commercials are the class songs in?  I don't particularly mind when music is used in a commercial.  Oh, I don't mind either.  I think it's a silly thing that people put on artists. 
[01:15:00]  Well, there was a time.  Don't use your music for commercial.  There was a time.  It was very taboo.  Yeah, they didn't do it.  Yeah, not so much anymore.  That's true.  Especially since music's being stolen now so much online and all that shit.  It's like, hey, man.  These guys are going to make fucking a couple million.  Let them make it.  You get a nice payday.  Well, Earl, your reflections on Lou Reed have been terrific today.  I'm hearing from people here.  Let's see.  Can Earl and Sal get a show together?  Just call it hipster bullshit.  Hmm.  What the hell is that about? 
[01:15:30]  It's not my opinion, Earl.  Not mine either.  It's obviously a horrible person.  I love Earl.  I think you filled in the blanks perfectly today because we're not Lou Reed fans here.  No, we need an education.  Now we have a little more knowledge on the whole thing.  A little education.  Oh, Earl.  I love Earl.  Earl rules.  I like throwing the ball around with Earl.  Just tossing it around with Earl.  Just tossing it around.  On the phones.  All right, Earl.  Good stuff today, buddy.  Love you.  Miss you.  Take care.  Call up Ronnie later. 
[01:16:00]  I want to hear that exchange.  Yes.  All right.  Ronnie will be all about Lou Reed today.  Yeah.  In a very brilliant way, I'm sure.  In a serious way.  Yes.  Fucking.  All right, Earl.  Thank you.  Ron's a bandwagon Lou Reed fan.  I think so, yeah.  Yeah.  He never listened to the songs.  The colored girl song I like.  The colored girl song.  Sam, you want to break down the black girl phone call?  He must do so terribly on job interviews.  You think he's really bad?  He has a lot of tells.  He knows he could use the phone as an excuse one time. 
[01:16:30]  He also knows if he repeats the question being asked, that it buys him more time.  Buys him that much more time.  Where he hopes something pops in his brain.  Right.  Because you go, what makes you, do you think you'd be a good candidate for this job?  Yes, I do.  Why do you think that?  Why do I think that?  He gets tripped up by the second question.  Why do I think I'd be a good candidate for the job?  Well, just generally, you know.  I have an appreciation for the business at hand.  Right.  It's all blood.  It's just vague. 
[01:17:00]  It's vagary.  This fucking.  And then he uses, I'm at a loss for words.  Yes.  See, people will accept that one time if you say it.  Yeah.  You can't say it every time a question is asked.  Earl, what comes out of Earl's mouth is like hamburger helper.  It just stretches and bulks up.  Right.  He just, he feigns death.  Yes.  So, like, he thinks that if he makes a short statement, he can trick people into thinking  it's poignant.  So, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, what are your qualifications for this job? 
[01:17:30]  What are my qualifications for this job?  Well, I've, you know, I have a lot of heart.  Like, what does that mean?  I have a lot of passion.  Passion for the business.  So, with that, you're breaking up.  Earl, I'm sitting right in front of you.  I'm sitting right in front of you.  I'm not on phone.  And then he completely panicked.  See, unfortunately, you guys at home didn't see this, but when he was silent for, it seemed  like about a minute.  I heard him.  He was in the background.  The phone didn't hang up yet. 
[01:18:00]  And then he doesn't even acknowledge when we call him back that he had a problem with  the phone.  Because he panicked and didn't know what to do and finally hung up on himself.  Not only does he not acknowledge it, but then you call him back and you go, Earl, and  he goes, what's up, guys?  It's like, hey, I'm back.  But nothing ever happened.  Hopefully you don't remember that I was just talking to you guys.  First time this morning, huh?  Yeah, how you doing?  So, all right.  More of the Opie and Anthony Warmers to the week.  Countdown.

[01:22:30]  The worst of the week countdown continues.  We're rolling right along.  It's the worst of the week countdown.  I am Sam Roberts, and you can hear me on the Opie and Anthony show every weekday morning.  Now, we're highlighting the very best of the Opie and Anthony shows this week.  Still to come, legendary Tim Conway in studio, Penn Jillette in studio,  Aziz Ansari in studio, with the return of Lady Di, nonetheless.  But right now, Brian Regan was in studio.  A lot of people stopped by in studio. 
[01:23:00]  Brian Regan was one of them.  Very, very famous comedian.  He's been doing the show forever, and he's never had a bad appearance.  Find me one.  I dare you.  You won't be able to do it, and this certainly wasn't one.  Brian Regan in studio, here on The Countdown.  What do you do?  Like, you've got to do something to keep your sanity on the road.  I mean, you've been doing this for a while.  Well, I sleep.  You just sleep? 
[01:23:30]  You don't go and, like, catch the sights of the cities you're in?  No, that's not my...  That's not your bag?  You know, I hate, like, when you do a local radio phoner or something like that,  and they're like, which one of your favorite things about our town?  Oh, no, that's...  You know, that's a jab at you.  No, I don't...  They've got to know you don't know.  Or else they're naive, and then you've just got to go,  Oh, I just love the sights and the...  And the community, the parks. 
[01:24:00]  You've got to go, you know, it's everything.  Or you do what I do and go, I've never been to your stupid town.  Hence the phone call because of lagging ticket sales.  There's Brian in his hotel room Googling Minnesota.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I do like it.  Right.  Yeah, the hog farms.  I did one, and they said, is this your first time to the town?  And I said, yeah, that's one thing that's fun about doing this is going to places that have never been before. 
[01:24:30]  Which is not true.  Well, and then I, well, well, that was a lie.  But then I felt weird inside, and then I looked at my calendar, and I was like, oh, man, I was there last year.  Oh, no.  And I'm thinking, what do these listeners think, you know, that they were at the show?  And I'm like, man, I've never been there.  He was here.  He forgot about us.  He forgot about us.  And our village.  Screw him.  Our village.  Yeah, their village.  I'm playing villages now.  Does he know that our number one export is toffee? 
[01:25:00]  No.  They're all insulted.  That's weird.  So you sleep.  A lot of comics, though, just hang out in the hotel room, sleep.  That seems like a kind of weird existence, though.  How much social interaction are you really getting?  My nickname in college was Rip for Rip Van Winkle.  Oh, okay.  I slept all the time.  You're ripping farts in the classroom. 
[01:25:30]  Ripping dresses off at knife points.  I don't want to go the Jack the Ripper route.  I want the sleeping under a tree route with a big beard.  Look out for Rip, ladies.  Things out by the park.  I think it would be great to travel like you guys do.  But after a while, you've been to these cities so many times, there's nothing else to check out, right?  Yeah.  So then you're just happy to get a nice hotel and a nice bed, I guess.  You still live in Vegas, right?  Yes.  You're coming out of Vegas or New York.  It's like there's so much for other cities to compete with the stimulation of what you can see just where you live. 
[01:26:00]  It's hard.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was in Vegas over the summer.  It was fucking nice.  Yeah.  It was so much fun.  Went down there and rented some of those machine guns.  Just fired those off at the range.  What a blast Vegas is.  I've been there 10 years.  I haven't shot a machine gun yet.  Oh, great.  What are you waiting for?  The guy's like, here you go.  Fire this one off.  I'm like, da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  This is great.  Yeah, we have plenty of guns for you here.  You can fire wherever you want. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, they don't give a fuck.  They don't care.  It's Vegas.  It's the Wild West.  You know, the whole gun controversy, I've been trying to understand the difference between an assault weapon and a non-assault weapon.  Right.  And any time anybody explains it on TV, I'm more confused after the explanation.  It's always said condescendingly, you got these guys thinking that a triple action, single pull tug, 44 magazine clip is the same as a 300 single bolt double action. 
[01:27:00]  That's like saying a 44, 7, 3, 8, 42 with a Colt revolver twist is going to be any different than a 300 single bolt action double clip.  Well, thanks for clarifying that.  That was the sticky point right there.  That's what I didn't understand.  Thanks for straightening me out on that.  Oh, shit.  That's exactly what it sounds like. 
[01:27:30]  Fucking yelling at each other on the news.  I don't know what's going on.  Yeah.  How often do you get back to Vegas?  A year.  A lot.  A lot, yeah.  Every weekend, right?  Well, during the week.  Recharge at the home base.  Uh-huh.  Got the kiddos back there.  Oh, yeah, sure.  How's that going?  Raising the kids.  It's good.  It's fun?  Yeah.  A little boy is 14.  A girl just turned 10.  Jesus.  Wow, that went fast.  That did go fast.  My goodness.  He's as tall as I am. 
[01:28:00]  No.  Wow.  And it's weird, you know?  Because he's like a little boy still in his heart and soul.  And, you know, I say, hey, man, it's time to go to bed.  And he goes in a man's voice now, okay.  And then he goes to bed.  And I'm like, all he's got to do is say, I don't think so.  He doesn't know that yet.  Right.  All he's got to say is, I don't think so.  And then he gets to stay up as long as he wants.  What are you going to do about it?  Yeah, what am I going to do?  All right, well, go to bed when you think you should, I guess. 
[01:28:30]  14 as tall as you already.  That's crazy.  What's in the food?  What's going on?  Is he an athlete?  Yeah, he's more in the video game thing.  Ah, yes.  He likes that whole world.  Visual athletics.  Yeah.  That's what I like.  I played something with him, Skyrim or something.  Oh, yeah, Skyrim.  He's in all that stuff.  And, you know, you spend 35 minutes creating a character.  You know, it's like you want your eyes to be sort of round or kind of round. 
[01:29:00]  You want them blue.  You want them hazel.  I just want to shoot things.  You know?  So, I finally create whatever this character is.  And then the very first thing you do, in this game anyway, is you go over and the guy  goes, come over here.  You're about to be beheaded.  And I'm like, I just spent 45 minutes creating this guy.  You're going to chop my head off?  I just did my hair.  Yeah.  Created my hair.  Created my hair and everything.  You're going to chop it off? 
[01:29:30]  I knew I would have created a guy with a thicker neck.  How wide can I make his neck?  What are his interests outside of video games?  Do you like comedy and stuff?  Is he a funny guy?  He said they're both funny.  My boy and my girl are both funny.  They make me laugh.  And, yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  It's cool.  That is...  One of my favorite experiences on stage one time was just out there doing my thing.  And I looked back and he was sitting in a place where I could see him and he was laughing 
[01:30:00]  hard at me.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  That was like one of the best feelings I ever had on stage, you know?  Damn.  Yeah.  What was the bit?  Do you remember?  Hope it wasn't some awful bit about killing your parents.  Yeah, you're right, Dad.  He's laughing his ass off.  You're pointing out, why wait for the money when you can kill them now while you're young  and enjoy it? 
[01:30:30]  Good point.  Let's go back and watch and date.  Wow.  That's pretty cool in here.  Are you dating?  My girlfriend is here.  Whoa.  You just pointed to Sam.  What is that?  My girlfriend right here, man.  I didn't even know.  My wife to my right is my girlfriend.  Yeah.  All right.  Good for Brian.  That's cool.  How'd you meet?  We met at Ron Schock.  He's a comedian.  Yeah.  His funeral.  He was one of the outlaws of comedy from Houston.  And he was living in Las Vegas at the time and, you know, passed away about a year ago. 
[01:31:00]  And I went to the service, not to the services, but there was a get-together that night for  any people in the comedy industry that, you know, wanted to show their respects.  And just because he was another comedian, I wanted to go.  And she had a connection, too.  She knew his wife.  And so that's where we met.  Wow.  Hey.  I never knew Ron Schock.  I hear he's a nice guy and a very funny dude.  I didn't know him.  I mean, I knew of him.  Just went for the chicks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He didn't know.  He went to funerals for the broads.  By the way, if you said that your girlfriend now was Ron Schock's ex, you would have been my hero 
[01:31:30]  forever.  No, no, no, no.  I would have went for the frauds.  Geez.  Yeah.  That's a few.  Oh, geez.  Well, that's cool.  How was that jumping back into the dating world?  Yeah, it's kind of cool.  Yeah?  You know?  He's like a same watch.  She's in the other room.  No, I know.  It's just, you know, not graphic details.  She's great, but the other chicks have been meeting her phenomenal.  Exactly.  No, no.  Of course, I'm joking.  Yeah. 
[01:32:00]  It's all good.  Yeah.  Is she from Vegas?  Well, she lives in Vegas.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Oh, I know what that just meant.  So you talked earlier about, uh...  Oh, okay.  Yes.  No, about hitting towns and stuff like that.  Right.  Yeah.  She wants to do that.  Oh, really?  See, I want to sleep in, and she's like, let's wake up and do stuff.  Let's wake up and do stuff?  Oh, boy.  This, uh, this, uh, this ain't gonna last.  This ain't gonna last.  Well, we expect our girlfriends to want to sit there and watch our third horse shit show 
[01:32:30]  in a row.  Like, you saw the Friday.  You saw, uh, the early show Saturday.  What do you mean you don't want to watch the late show Saturday, too?  I'm brilliant.  Look at the people laugh every show.  Oh, boy.  There's a fucking woman's awe of comedy wear off two weekends on the road, and they're  fucking done with it.  They're finished.  You mind if I fly back, uh, home and pack?  No, she hangs in there.  That's good.  How long?  How long have you been hanging out?  Uh, a little over a year now.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, you're in that magic, the magic portion of the relationship. 
[01:33:00]  I love that.  Right?  We hold hands.  Oh, it's adorable.  It's adorable.  Make out.  Just open display.  Brian makes out.  I put, um, we were at the movies a couple weeks ago, and I put my arm around her.  Oh.  Yeah.  It's pretty smooth.  That's nice.  So, uh...  That's good.  Jump up.  Did you do the old...  We're gonna see what this takes us.  You'll hollow out the popcorn bucket routine. 
[01:33:30]  Have that old gag.  Has anyone actually done that?  No.  You think?  Yeah.  Make someone just try that?  Of course.  Get some popcorn.  What was that, from Diner?  Yeah.  Was it?  Was it Diner?  I don't know.  It's an old gag.  It's been around for a long time.  It wasn't a movie.  It wasn't a movie.  Yeah, it wasn't.  Absolutely.  It wasn't a movie.  What movie were you gonna see in?  What have you seen lately?  Gravity?  I haven't seen Gravity yet.  It's terrific.  Saw Lincoln.  Oh, wow.  Wow. 
[01:34:00]  That's a great one to take a woman to.  Yeah, you want her to hate you.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm gonna put my arm around her going, you know, uh...  Let's take a nap.  I just want you to know I'm anti-slavery.  And you know if she's smart or not, if she's going, what happened at the end of this?  Yeah.  I don't want to ruin it for her.  Old Budinsky gets his.  I wanted to like that movie, but that was long.  Oh, gosh.  Why are they making movies this long now?  I thought an hour and a half was sort of the deal.  It was perfect, right? 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, now they're all two, these epics, and it's like, I don't need an epic.  Every movie I used to watch on TV, when it was on like Channel 5 or Channel 11, those  crappy channels, was 90 minutes long, and that was with commercials.  Remember the westerns, especially, would take all afternoons.  Sci-fis.  But it would be a two, three hour, fuck it, you would have to commit with the commercials.  No, those are like How the West Was Won, like those epic westerns and stuff.  But if you were just watching some Godzilla movie, 90 fucking minutes, that was it. 
[01:35:00]  With commercials?  With commercials.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Bam, 90 minutes.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, now it's, you know, you go to the theater, you've got to invest four fucking hours, and  like, how long, Gravity wasn't long.  90 minutes.  That was 90 minutes.  Very brief, actually.  There you go.  That was, uh.  It was great.  A good length for a movie, though.  Gravity was really good.  I would like to see that.  That seems like a good one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what else.  It's visually stunning.  But the story, I don't know.  Sandra Bullock, she's the same girl from the bus. 
[01:35:30]  In space, though.  In space?  That's my review.  That's my big review.  Well, that's fucking, uh.  Thumb down?  No.  You don't like it as much as the rest of us.  Go see it, because it looks great.  It's like cutting-edge fucking filmmaking.  You've got to see the 3D and.  Well, it was like the IMAX and all that crap.  Like the Titanic, you know?  Right.  I like the special effects.  I didn't need the first half of the Titanic.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  I could have gone in halfway through and just watched that thing sink.  The sinking was great, right?  The love story stuff. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  No, no, no.  That stuff's yucky.  Right?  That's icky.  That stuff's icky.  So does your lovely young lady have cooties?  We don't like cooties.  No.  No, of course not.  Brian's doing good.  I like that.  Got a girl who's working like a mother.  This is good.  Do you do any acting work at all?  Because Brian's like a pure comic.  I like his career.  It's like a Carlin career.  But there's maybe a little bit of acting if you want to. 
[01:36:30]  But you fucking just sell and do great fucking stand-up.  Well, that's very, very kind.  I did a movie.  My only movie role ever here.  There's the Chris Rock thing.  Oh, right.  We saw you walking down the hall.  We did a little of that.  You changed when that happened, too.  I said hi to Brian.  He didn't even look at me.  Who's this?  He's headed to my dressing room.  This guy away from me.  It's the time.  I'm hoping they don't cut me out.  We'll see.  Have you been offered?  It's the only thing I've ever been in.  You had to have been offered roles in like, you know. 
[01:37:00]  No?  Why aren't you offered stuff?  That's so weird.  I don't know.  Playing the wacky teacher in some high school movie.  Hey.  Welcome to social studies.  Just don't gravitate that way.  No, huh?  Did you like it?  The Chris Rock experience?  Oh, man.  It was a lot of fun.  Yeah.  I played a radio producer.  All right.  And I'm trying to get him to do a liner.  And I keep telling him that he's not being funny enough, which we can relate to.  Sure.  And he'll do it. 
[01:37:30]  I'll go, ah, that's good.  But if you could just kind of make it funny, you know.  And he gets increasingly pissed off at me.  Of course.  Who wants to hear that?  Right.  Make it funny.  What do you fucking mean?  Shut up.  I mean, as I'm doing my stuff, I'm relating to his end of it going.  Because it's happened to me so many times.  Have fun with it.  I did a morning TV thing one time.  And they're like, we're going to go to you right before we go to commercial for 30 seconds.  Just be really funny, okay?  What?  What do you want me to do?  Just be really funny. 
[01:38:00]  Just be really funny.  Hey!  Hey!  It's Brian!  How much?  20 seconds.  What are you doing here?  Hey!  They're going to be talking to me when we come back.  You should have done just that.  Like we have a light switch, you know, a funny switch.  Tell them to do the news for 30 seconds without the teleprompter on and see where they go.  Those bastards.  See, I'm all serious now. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, but I...  Hey, you tell them, Brian.  Right.  I like when they go from the light-hearted story to the serious story, but don't realize  how serious the next story is, so they're laughing coming out of the previous one going,  boy, that sure sounds like one crazy Thanksgiving dinner.  47 people were killed today.  It's like, wow, man, you had to switch fast.  You'd think they'd take that into consideration.  Yeah, right. 
[01:39:00]  Kind of...  Softened it a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Kind of ease into it.  Maybe something in between.  Something in between there.  I heard a cricket during a show.  That's a true story.  You did.  I did a joke.  I was bombing at a corporate gig, and I did a joke, and a window was open near the stage,  and I heard a...  And that's like the proverbial thing.  Disheartening.  Aaron Crick.  Yes!  Yeah.  My punchline, then that.  And the audience heard it, too, and I was like, wow. 
[01:39:30]  It's like funny.  That's funny he brings a cricket for when he bombs.  Amazing.  I need a cricket wrangler.  Ryan and a cricket.  You're really bombing?  I can't picture you bombing at a cricket.  Ever.  You're perfect for them.  Well, I mean, I appreciate it, but yeah, I mean, everybody's going to have their bad shows,  you know?  And when I bomb, I bomb big.  Wow.  Because I'm physical, you know?  I mean, like, if you're just a monologist, you can kind of act like, well, that wasn't  supposed to get a laugh anyway.  I can't pretend that. 
[01:40:00]  I'm up there, moving around.  If it's just, the room is filled with silence, it's just nothing but awkward.  Do you know, I would give a year of my life to see that for an hour?  Oh, wow.  The joy of watching that.  You would love that.  Oh, my God.  Watching Brian squirming in front of a crowd.  Because, again, Brian, it's so, I can't picture it happening.  I mean, I don't think I've ever seen Brian in a bad set.  Ever.  That's nice, but.  Pantomiming, eating, and fucking watching people just looking on with nothing. 
[01:40:30]  It's going to happen.  Wow.  I did one show one time and just got nothing, you know?  It was like an hour-long set in front of a bunch of older guys.  I got a golf club, you know what I mean?  Older guys without their wives.  And then somebody thinks it's a good idea to bring a clean comedian in to a bunch of guys  who are drinking after rounds of golf.  Yeah.  So I got nothing.  And what made it worse is they were incredibly polite.  Like, they paid attention.  Like, I would rather they all start talking. 
[01:41:00]  I would rather they just start talking.  And then you go, oh, they're not paying attention.  And I'm like, no, they're paying attention.  They're not hearing my genius.  And rejecting it.  And they're rejecting me.  And I got off stage.  And this guy came up to me and handed me a glass of scotch and said, I thought you might  want this.  I was like, you are right.  You are right.  They were probably all laughed out, too.  Golfing with just guys.  They're joking.  Because they know how to joke.  Laughing out on the golf course.  When they're out there, right? 
[01:41:30]  And then they get back and it's like, ah.  They all got a joke or two.  They're all comedians out there on the course.  Of course.  That's what an agent or a publicist would say on the way back to the hotel.  They're all laughed out.  They're all laughed out.  You have to go to sleep with that.  They were laughed out.  They were right.  I believe that.  How do you have the gig go?  That's a big point.  They were laughed out.  They were laughed out.  I believe that.  You know what that means, right?  Wow.  The worst is yet to come.  More of the Opie and Anthony worst of the week countdown.

[01:46:30]  The worst of the week countdown continues.  Yes, indeed.  It is the countdown.  I am Sam Roberts, and I am bringing you the very best of the Opie and Anthony show this week  and making it a little more digestible for everybody.  Still to come, Penn Jillette is in studio.  So is the legendary Tim Conway.  Right now, Aziz Ansari was in studio.  I think it's only his second time on the Opie and Anthony show.  Of course, you know him from Parks and Rec on NBC. 
[01:47:00]  Hopefully, you've seen his comedy special that's on Netflix right now.  If you haven't, look it up.  This guy is a hilarious comic.  He's an A-list celebrity.  And when he comes on the Opie and Anthony show, he has to deal with the likes of Lady Di.  Not Princess Diana, but the show's Lady Di.  One of the most hateable people you will ever hear.  She was on the show a couple months back.  She had a vaginal discharge, if you remember.  Just a complete wreck and a waste of space.  She decided to call the show while we were talking to Aziz Ansari. 
[01:47:30]  Here it is.  Lady Di's big return to the Opie and Anthony show with Aziz in studio.  This one person has been calling forever.  We've got to get them on the line.  Hi, who's this?  You know who it is.  How are you doing?  It's me, it's Di.  Hello, man.  We're talking to Aziz.  You got anything?  Yeah, no, I just want to let you know. 
[01:48:00]  Tell Jim Norton this.  We're going to be at the show on Friday.  I'm at the Beacon Theater with Andrew Dice Clay on Friday.  Whoa, that's awesome.  Yeah, I'm happy about that.  Very cool.  It's going to be a great gig.  It's going to be an amazing gig.  It's an awesome venue.  Yeah, it's going to be very good.  Delighted that you'll be there.  She's just gaffing over.  Why would you call our radio show to tell us that you're going to be at a Jim Norton show?  She's one of our regulars of Aziz.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  I just figured I'd call up and let you know.  Oh, why would we care if you were going? 
[01:48:30]  For what purpose?  That's what he asked you.  Did you see what you said?  Thank you.  Oh, he goes, why would you call up and ask Jim Norton or tell Jim Norton you're going  to be at the show?  And she goes, no, no.  I just wanted to call up and tell him I was going to be there and let him know.  But he asked you why you would do that.  What could he possibly be doing with that information?  Now he's got that info.  What is he supposed to do with that?  Nothing.  I'm just letting him know that I'm going to be at the show.  Hi, Jim.  Hi, Dye.  Yes, chanting fan base. 
[01:49:00]  Marion and I are going to be at the show.  All right.  That's great.  So let's take this one step further.  All right.  You've told me.  I've acknowledged the information.  Ball's in your court.  Thank you.  All right.  But what happens with that?  Why does Jim need to know that?  No.  I just wanted to let you guys know that I'm going to be at the show.  Especially because this is like a...  Man, what compels you to...  Is there anything more terrifying than Norton's fans?  And she's just babbling underneath us talking. 
[01:49:30]  Can you show Aziz a photo of this enchantress that we're listening to?  Yes.  Colin, by the way, Colin is obsessed with her.  Yeah.  We all are.  What?  I'm going to change that photo.  Well, it doesn't matter which one you pick.  Trust me.  The Twitter photo is not bad, Dye.  You look a little tired in it, but you're lovely.  No, go to her Twitter account.  Her Twitter photo.  Yeah, where she looks like Babe Ruth and Babe Ruth is still living.  Yeah. 
[01:50:00]  No, no, no.  Not that one, please.  Babe Ruth, when he gave that speech.  Rawr, rawr, rawr.  I bet.  I bet.  I bet.  I bet.  But I wish she would answer the question.  I need to break this down.  Like, why would Jimmy care about that info?  And why do you have to call, like, hopefully a very popular radio show to say that?  She'll never have an answer.  Oh.  Wait, let's see.  I want to see the tweets.  Oh, the tweets?  Oh, they're good.  You got to follow her.  She's amazing on Twitter.  A lot of responses to other people.  Yeah, she's amazing on Twitter. 
[01:50:30]  Her face?  Wait, let me see that Twitter pic again.  A lot of her tweets are, thank you very much.  Thanks again.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They're real productive.  They're so annoying.  I DM those tweets.  Oh, God, imagine getting those.  Yeah.  When you text someone, I'm on the right back.  Cool.  Yeah.  You wasted my life.  Pop that picture of her up, her Twitter picture again.  She almost looks like if Sammy Hagar got stung by bees.  That's a new one.  Yeah, yeah.  We got to write down all the people she looks like.  Oh, yeah.  Of course, throw mama from the train.  My little chickadee. 
[01:51:00]  No, no, no.  Please don't do this.  No, no, no.  I'm going to change that picture.  Why?  It's lovely.  It's not going to make a difference.  How did you first get into Jim's stuff?  Where did you first hear about Jim?  When did I first hear about Jim?  The repeat of the question.  She'll do that constantly.  Hold on, hold on.  What?  I've known about Jim Norton for years.  Where did you first see his stuff?  Like on Comedy Central? 
[01:51:30]  Did you get a CD?  See, Aziz is entertained by this, too.  What?  Back in the WNEW days.  When we were on the radio in NEW back in 19.  Oh, so through the show.  Through the show, she became a fan and blah, blah, blah.  That's how both of us heard about Jim Norton.  You have a friend, Mary, and they're just...  We call them the retarded Laverna and Shirley.  I'm going deep in the hole.  Oh, yeah, you are.  Just stop now before it's like, Aziz, I'm coming to see you, too.  Oh, she'll be there, yeah. 
[01:52:00]  Make sure you tweet Aziz and tell them how much you love.  She'll stalk you next.  Listen, Lady Di, I'm going to try one more time.  Yeah.  You needed to tell Jimmy that you're going to be at the show.  Now, what is he supposed to do with that info?  Nothing.  I just want to let him know that we're going to be there.  Me and Marion and I are going to be there.  Yeah, we know.  So he kind of is a show...  Marion.  Hey, they're like, hey, you're doing the show?  We're going to be there, support you?  All right.  Got tickets?  Wait, hold on.  Marion does not have a Wi-Fi. 
[01:52:30]  A Wi-Fi?  What's a Wi-Fi?  A Wi-Fi is like the first generation of the satellite radio, right?  Yeah.  A portable?  Yeah, a portable Wi-Fi.  But why are you wasting our time with this?  Well, I told Marion I was going to call up.  Oh, that doesn't...  I've never heard anybody...  It's uncanny, the ability you have to relay impertinent information. 
[01:53:00]  I've never heard anybody with an ability to tell me such nonsense.  I've learned nothing in like five minutes.  Nothing.  Opie and Anthony, can I ask you a question?  It's like context, like we were discussing earlier, though.  You do understand you're telling a national, hopefully, huge radio audience this stuff.  International.  Canada, too.  No one cares.  This is like a private phone call.  Right, right.  It's a private phone call.  All right.  She was trying to get a Wi-Fi, so this way she could listen to this. 
[01:53:30]  And then she doesn't even hear what I'm trying to tell her.  Why do we need to hear this now?  We don't care if she can't get a Wi-Fi.  Nobody can get a Wi-Fi.  They stopped making that.  It's in 2006.  I can't get a Wi-Fi anymore.  All right.  I understand that.  Oh.  I understand that.  Did you get a job yet?  Did you get a job yet?  No.  Oh.  Why?  I knew this conversation was going to come up.  No, I did not get a job yet.  When did you look?  I've been looking, and I already know where to go, but I just don't bother because I just – well, let's put it this way. 
[01:54:00]  What way?  I'm taking a break from this job search thing.  If you only understood that deeply.  She has never worked.  She's been looking for a job for 10 years.  She has decided to take a break from the looking for a job thing.  That's like me taking a job for being an astronaut. 
[01:54:30]  Taking a break.  Right, right.  Taking a break.  Taking a job.  Sorry, her yapping through a fucking thing.  Taking a break from being an astronaut.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Why?  Lady Di.  Wait.  Hold on.  What?  You haven't worked in 10 years or so.  At least.  How are you –  What are you talking about?  No, I did work 10 years ago.  Let's get the facts straight.  But you –  I did so.  I know.  That's what I said.  10 years.  But you haven't – 
[01:55:00]  Why would you take a break from trying to find a job?  Yeah.  Why do I work so hard?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Take 10 years off and just –  And still be alive.  It's amazing.  So much awesome stuff.  You could still be alive.  Who am I trying to impress?  And you could still go to see Jim Norton without working.  It's amazing.  Maybe she's figured everything out.  Yeah.  And we're the idiots.  We're the dummies.  Waking up early on radio.  No, no, no, no, no.  Doing a bunch of stand-up.  Who cares?  Take 10 years off.  And then she's got to answer it.  No, no, no.  You guys aren't dummies. 
[01:55:30]  I mean, why don't more people do that?  Thanks.  Where it's like, I'm just going to chill for 10 years.  Not going to do anything.  Not going to work.  No, no.  Just going to do what I want to do.  That seems like a good deal.  I'm going to chill for 10 years.  Diane, do you understand –  I'm not sure if you understand the dynamics of a conversation.  But like, is he just talking or Ope's talking to somebody?  Like, the sounds coming out of their mouth mean they should be entering your ears.  Yeah, yeah.  But you're just yapping over everybody.  You're very difficult to have a conversation with.  Who are you?  I don't know who he is. 
[01:56:00]  I'm Jim Norton.  I like Jim Norton.  You know, the guy that you're going to see Friday and the reason why you called us to tell us that you're going to see him.  Do you have dementia?  Yeah.  I don't have dementia.  Why would you ask who I am when you've known me for 14 years?  Yeah.  Well, that's true, too.  I'm sorry about that.  That's true, too.  Holy shit.  Hold on a second.  What?  I thought maybe you had a comedian in there with you. 
[01:56:30]  We do.  We do.  And I said that as well.  What is his name?  I said Aziz.  That's how this whole thing started.  I said we have Aziz in.  Do you have anything to ask him?  Aziz Ansari.  He's a comedian.  Okay.  Do you know –  I mean, I don't know what to say.  How about hello?  Do you know who he is?  Well, no.  Now I know who he is.  How about you say hi?  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  All right.  How are you doing? 
[01:57:00]  I covered that already.  Was that you, Jimmy?  No.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  You're a disaster.  What am I doing?  I'm confused.  Yeah, no shit.  Are you drinking this morning?  She's drinking.  She's a big drinker.  What did you have this morning?  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  It's not even 10 in the morning.  Well, if that's why she's giving up that job search.  What are you having this morning?  Natural life.  Natural life. 
[01:57:30]  She's drinking some Natty's.  Some Natty Lights, motherfucker.  Oh, she's drinking in the morning.  It's natural.  She's Natty.  By the way, anyone out there working, you're all suckers and saps.  10 years off.  And rubes.  Yeah.  Crack open a crisp Natty Light.  Natty.  That's it.  9.45 a.m.  Oh, my God.  What time did you wake up this morning?  Dear.  What time did I wake up?  Yes.  Around 6 o'clock.  What time? 
[01:58:00]  And don't lie now.  We're all friends.  What time did you have your first alcoholic beverage?  Crack that first beer.  What time?  Tell the truth.  This is my second one.  Oh, no.  Do you drink fast?  It's getting dark.  What?  No.  It's my second one.  How many are you going to have?  What time did you crack it?  I just cracked it.  No.  What time did you crack the first beer?  The first one?  About a half hour ago.  Maybe an hour.  No.  About an hour ago.  All right.  9.  9 a.m. 
[01:58:30]  You start drinking on a Tuesday.  What did you do between 6 and 9?  Well, I had to...  Let me see.  I washed up.  I brushed my teeth.  All right.  There's two minutes.  For three hours?  I was on the phone for three hours trying to get in touch with you guys.  Oh, wow.  That is true.  So she sat...  That's why I finally took her call.  She sat on hold.  More or less.  Or trying to call in.  Off and on, yeah.  For three hours.  Just to tell...  Relay the information that she's going to the show. 
[01:59:00]  Right.  Now I'm not sure you have anything figured out, guy.  I thought you had a whole plan worked out.  The whole, like, 10-year breather.  She waited...  I was on board.  Now I'm not so sure.  Yeah.  She waited three hours to tell Jimmy that she's going to be at the show Friday with Marion.  I mean, there is a conceivable...  I can't even wrap my head around that.  There's a conceivable reality where she waits three hours, calls and says, she's waiting  for three hours.  Hey, Jim, I'm going to be on the show.  All right, cool. 
[01:59:30]  Bye.  That's it.  And that's it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It must be a wonderful thing to live like that.  Di, I got to ask you, why have you given up the job search?  Oh, no, no.  I'm just taking a little break from it.  Yes.  Why are you taking a...  I did not give up.  I'm just taking a break.  Why are you taking a break?  Because...  Well, let me tell you something right now.  Because I'm taking a break because it seems to me like a lot of people do not want to  hire people that are over 50 years old. 
[02:00:00]  And I'm over 50.  Do you understand?  Yes.  Wow, she's giving us a talk show.  So taking a break, what are you going to get, younger?  What was the excuse when you were 40?  Yeah, exactly.  I was working when I was 40 years old.  Opie, you don't remember?  I don't know.  Yeah, it was 10 years ago when you were working.  What do you think people like to hire less, 50-year-olds or women who wake up at 9 o'clock  in the morning and start drinking Natty Light?  Exactly.  You're living a rap video. 
[02:00:30]  I got the beer wrong.  Anthony, you got the beer wrong.  It's Natty Ice.  Natty Ice!  All right, we got the natural ice.  Natty Ice.  Natty Ice.  Natty Light.  No thanks.  Yeah, yeah.  Is it a can or a bottle?  It's a little bit stronger than Natty Light.  A little strong, but good.  You got to get a little of that ice action, right?  Natty Ice.  Hey, is it a, uh, Di, is it a can or a bottle?  A little break.  Uh, what?  A can.  Of course. 
[02:01:00]  Just smoking beer out of a can.  Just cracking that, that warm, that piss-warm can in Natty Ice.  Natty Ice.  They're not, they're not warm.  They're not warm.  Oh, okay.  Good, good.  Yeah, they're good.  That's, that's great.  So now, why do you think that people don't want to hire 50-year-old women, right?  Right.  Uh, but why, hey, hey, hey, listen up, listen up.  You don't think people want to hire, so you're going to take a break and wait for more time  to pass by.  That problem isn't going to solve itself by adding more time to it. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, I don't know.  I mean, you know, this, this whole thing with the computers and stuff like that, that's  kind of difficult to get on a computer.  Well, you could have spent the last three hours learning something about it.  Right.  Yeah, I know, I know.  I have, my computer.  They're not that difficult.  I got a three-year-old that's rocking the computer.  A girl or a boy?  Oh, Jesus.  Wait, at least, at least you grasped the, the really important part of the discussion.  Lady Di, Lady Di, Lady Di, listen to me. 
[02:02:00]  Where, where, where was the last place and when that you tried to get a job?  Family Dollar.  That's what she said she was in here.  That was, that's a long time ago.  That was months ago.  Yeah, whenever the, I made that video.  Family Dollar, isn't that chain gone?  I think so, like Blockbuster.  I saw one of those in South Carolina, like, 15 years ago.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, it's still there.  Family Dollar still around?  Family, you live in New York? 
[02:02:30]  Family Dollar?  She's picking up obscure places.  Corvettes.  Corvettes.  Clines.  Elizabeth, New Jersey.  Elizabeth, New Jersey.  All right.  Good.  Lady Di, so you haven't, you haven't looked for a job in months.  No, try one month.  No, no, no.  When you, you were, you were on this very show months ago talking about, talking about the  dollar store.  Yeah. 
[02:03:00]  That was months ago.  May.  May.  You just told me.  It was May.  June, July, I was, what, six months ago almost?  Six months ago was the dollar store.  Five months of change.  Remember the day you had that discharge?  Donnie, it was six months ago that you haven't looked for a job.  Right.  Okay.  Are you coming to the show?  Now you're making me lie?  No, it was, it was that month.  It was June. 
[02:03:30]  No, it wasn't.  Isn't June pretty close to May, which makes our point still?  Yeah, yeah.  That it's been a while.  Certainly out of the one month time frame that she gave.  So isn't, how long of a break are you going to take?  It's already six months.  How long of a break are you going to take from looking for work?  Um, I don't know.  A couple more weeks.  Let's put it that way.  A couple more weeks.  And then, and then we're.  What a wonderful way to live.  It's amazing.  She's just sipping, sipping beer.  Not a worry in the world.  Not working. 
[02:04:00]  Got some natties.  Getting on the phone.  Nine in the morning.  Going to see Jim Norton November 1st.  Could kill three hours just to tell Jimmy that they're going to the show.  Yeah.  Andrew Dice Clay, right?  Yes, lady.  Myself and Dice Clay.  Andrew Dice Clay.  How are you getting the money for the ticket?  Yeah, Di, how much of your dad's, uh, your, your dad's will are you going through?  Oh, my God.  Don't even mention that.  How much have you gone through?  How much have I gone through? 
[02:04:30]  That was the question.  Uh, uh, I try to keep it on a minimum basis.  Let's put it that way.  By not working, and by drinking natty ice, and going to see Jim Norton.  Oh, don't forget, I'm going to go see Michael Nesmith, too.  November 2nd.  He don't care.  She calls it every month, lets you know what show she's going to.  She's a huge Monkees fan.  On, uh...  Huge.  Oh, is that who Michael Nesmith is?  Yeah, so the Monkees, she loves the Monkees.  Give us a little, uh, give us a little Monkees for, uh, Aziz. 
[02:05:00]  So we don't feel like we've wasted his time.  What do you want me to, uh, to, to say about the Monkees?  Sing one of the Monkees songs.  I thought, no, no, no, I better not sing that again.  Let me see.  Again.  Um...  Oh, boy.  Another Monkees song.  You sound like a real fanatic.  Big fan, yeah.  Walking down the street, we get the funniest looks from...  Bet you do.  ...everymore we meet.  Hey, hey, we're the drunkies. 
[02:05:30]  I knew you were going to do that.  Oh, you knew?  Did ya?  Right now she's standing barefoot in big grandma panties with a t-shirt and a fucking beer.  Slugging out of a beer.  Natty Ice.  Natty Ice.  You can't get over that, right?  You can't get over that, right?  Oh, man.  What a life.  Walk over to Budden and start working for them again.  Lady Di, do you have a Halloween costume?  Um, no.  I'm the Halloween costume. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, wow.  Are you going to Anthony's party?  Uh, no, I'm not.  You are invited.  Uh, you and Marianne are both invited to Anthony's big shindig.  Yep.  Uh, well, I don't think so.  What's the address?  Ah, yeah.  If you stay on hold, we'll get you that.  Can you call tomorrow and let us know for sure you're going?  Yeah, please.  We're not going to the party.  Why not?  Because we don't want to go.  I think I want this drunk buffoon at my party.  She'd be the head of the party. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, she would be wonderful.  Certainly, everyone would hit her.  Yeah.  All right, Lady Di, it's been terrific.  You're a delight.  You are.  Good to meet you.  Good to meet you.  Good to meet you.  You too.  All right.  Lady Di, go get a job.  All right, be careful.  I sure will.  You're just languishing in a sea of delusion and alcoholism.  Jimmy, I'll see you on Friday.  I know.  I appreciate you coming, Di. 
[02:07:00]  Just stop drinking.  And so we'll marry you too.  I know.  I understand.  We know she's going.  Okay.  So you can speak for herself, though.  Yes.  Fucking inheritance is like one of those, what do they call that thing?  The little sand-clocky thing with the hourglass.  Thank you.  Sand-clocky.  Hourglass.  All that money that her dad worked his entire life for and then, you know, passed on to another  world and gave Di the money instead of, you know, maybe taking care of her son with 
[02:07:30]  it.  She's buying Natty Ice.  She's still family.  And, uh...  You going to see Michael Nesmith?  Yes, I am.  Sherry said goodbye.  In Englewood.  Wow, that's pretty impressive.  Where are your seats?  Don't go.  Oh, yeah?  Don't go.  What is Michael Nesmith going to do?  He doesn't sing any of the Monkees' songs.  Yes, he does.  No.  He does. 
[02:08:00]  He has to sing now.  He doesn't sing.  He wasn't the singer in the Monkees.  But the singer's dead, so...  He was one of them.  What?  He was one of them.  No.  What songs did he sing?  He sang a couple of the really bad ones that no one knows.  I know them all.  He didn't sing Daydream Believer.  No, no, no.  That was Davy Jones.  Yeah.  I already know about that.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  I already know about that.  Yeah, of course you know about it.  There wasn't a rumor that was confirmed.  She's so terrible. 
[02:08:30]  All right.  I met Davy Jones years ago.  All right.  I hope you meet him again.  I hope you meet him again soon.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  We got to let you go for real.  Goodbye, Dye.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  10-09?  Jesus.  What?  Wow.  It's 10 after 10.  Yeah.  It went fast.  I hope you enjoyed that, Aziz.  We did that for you.  Aziz.  Very interesting.  Colin Quinn can't get enough of her.  Oh, Colin loves her.  And her friend, Marion.  Yeah.  He's a bit obsessed with her and Marion.  Yeah. 
[02:09:00]  What are you doing, folks?  Marion is just as trippy.  Let me tell you.  That was a great call by Lady Di.  Huh?  That was a great call.  I think so.  It was hilarious.

The worst of the week, Countdown.  No!  Continues.  Almost at the top of the Countdown.  Boy, is this exciting. 
[02:13:30]  My name is Sam Roberts, and I am bringing to you the worst of the week Countdown,  which is a highlight show of all the wonderfulness that happened this week on Opie and Anthony.  Of course, if you missed any of this, it's on demand, and it replays throughout the weekend,  and it's all good.  If you want to make any suggestions to me, then tweet me at NotSam.  Now, I'll get to the legendary Tim Conway in studio in a moment.  First, Penn Jillette was in studio.  A legend in his own right, and one of our favorite guests, Penn Jillette. 
[02:14:00]  He may be the best dude to come on the Opie and Anthony show.  Always excellent.  He hasn't been on since Celebrity Apprentice.  And if you remember, he stopped by, and we all said,  Of course, Penn, we want you to win Celebrity Apprentice.  Until everybody met Trace Atkins, and the whole show turned on Penn.  It was really a saddening, saddening thing to see.  But Penn Jillette confronted the guys on it.  Penn Jillette on the Opie and Anthony show.  On this year, Countdown. 
[02:14:30]  Celebrity Apprentice, we haven't talked to you since.  How the fuck do you lose to that guy?  First of all, I tell you, have Trace on.  He's a good guy.  You'll have a good time.  Didn't I tell you that?  We ended up really liking him.  But totally liking him to the point.  We blew you off.  I go to that show, my show that night, and they go,  I thought, oh, they liked you.  And I go, yeah, we get along great.  What was it?  And they go, well, they're telling Trace he's going to win and fuck you.  And they're, I go, what? 
[02:15:00]  And I said, they didn't say his ice cream was better.  No.  They said, well, he didn't say it was worse.  I said, what's wrong with those fuckers?  How long have I been your friend?  I know.  How many times have I tickled your ball sack with my tongue?  I know, Penn.  Can I break this down for you?  Okay, break it down.  Your ice cream was way the fuck better.  Way the fuck better.  To the point I continued buying even.  Fuck yeah, we know that.  We didn't even have to buy it anymore.  I was still buying it.  We discussed that.  No one thinks, no one in the world thinks it's better.  But quite honestly, your personal story wasn't as impressive as his. 
[02:15:30]  What's his personal story?  Oh, my God.  He got shot in the heart and lived.  We weren't competing on being in the wrong place when a bullet's being fired.  Are you telling me it's the smarter person that gets shot through the fucking heart?  He actually has a real bullet shot at him.  Fuck yeah.  No, see, the goal in life is the one who gets hurt the less wins.  That's true.  What the fuck is wrong with you people?  And then.  And he was funnier than me, I suppose, on the fucking show.  No.  No, no, no.  Okay.  But he had better stories. 
[02:16:00]  He hasn't been shot at many times.  That's true.  No, a fake shot.  No, but I have also been really shot at.  I've really had a gun pulled on me twice.  Oh, man.  And it was not fired.  And I consider that to be, because I handled the situation, better.  Better than Trace did.  Better.  Let me just give you a little piece of advice.  Uh-huh.  Getting shot worse than not getting shot.  I got to agree with that.  So let's see.  Trace is a better talker than me.  Yeah.  Smarter than me.  Oh, no.  Better ice cream than me.  You wouldn't believe it wasn't me, right?  And I got really. 
[02:16:30]  Let me tell you this.  In the celebrity apprentice world, you get sucked into that Scrooge McDuck fucking wacko shit.  You get sucked into it, and you believe it, right?  Yes.  So the final thing is coming down.  I come on, do my buddies.  They're really supportive.  I'm feeling great, right?  It's great.  I go to do a show in wherever the fuck it was, New Jersey, right?  And I'm feeling pretty good about myself.  And I'm out signing autographs after the show.  Like a thousand people want to sign my autograph.  And guy number five goes, man, oh, and they sold you out. 
[02:17:00]  And I go, what do you mean?  They go, oh, they were saying that Trace should win.  Trace was the winner.  Oh, my God.  They were, he's never been on the show before.  And they go, oh, they love him.  They just sold you right there.  And so I go, okay, well, this guy's a nut, right?  Because you get nuts, right?  Yes, yes, sure.  Of course, you get nuts.  Sign another 10, 15 autographs.  Uh-huh.  Whoa, did you hear O&A?  Oh, no.  What do you mean I hear O&A?  No. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, they sure love Trace, man.  They were sucking his dick.  Okay.  You bunch of fucking rats out there is what you are.  Okay, let me just bring the whole thing, the whole thing to an end.  Just a misunderstanding, yeah, yeah.  Take all the jokes out and everything.  Okay.  We finished signing, about 1,000 people.  Yeah.  I'm standing there.  We sign outside.  Yeah.  1,000 people have left.  I'm standing there picking up my markers, picking up my water.  Glenn comes over.  Glenn goes, you okay?  And I go, I'm a little bummed. 
[02:18:00]  It's stupid.  Oh, no.  I'm a little bummed.  Oh, no.  He says, what, what, why, why?  And I go, well, I heard that like O&A were saying that Trace should win.  And he says, you know that this game doesn't mean anything to you.  You don't give a fuck.  I said, I don't give a fuck, but it just feels, I feel like I've just gone through some sort  of weird breakup.  I'm really bummed.  And he says to me, well, you know, it's all the pressure of the show.  You've been working hard.  You haven't been sleeping.  And I said, it was like five people.  He said, I'm sure it's a misunderstanding. 
[02:18:30]  I'm going to call tomorrow.  And the next day, he says to me, yeah, I guess they do.  Oh, no.  Hold on.  I do have two other points here.  First of all, with the Trace Atkins, what impressed us, he gets shot in the heart by his wife or  girlfriend at the time, and he doesn't scream.  And he's just relaxed and goes, all right, call 911.  No, but that's in the story.  What?  It was impressive.  But that's in the story.  It's impressive.  Yeah.  It doesn't mean it happened that way.  Well, we're gullible. 
[02:19:00]  We believe half your tricks.  They're not tricks.  Sorry, sorry.  And here's the other thing about...  They're swindles.  Here's the other thing about Celebrity Apprentice that blew me away for real.  I saw the finale, because I was rooting for you in the end.  You know that.  Oh, I don't know that.  Say that again.  We are rooting for you.  Okay, well, do you mean it?  I was hoping you won, but his goddamn story was like, oh, God.  It's like he made it up to win.  Yes.  It had to be...  That's precisely my point.  He had to make up for the fact that his ice cream was horrendous. 
[02:19:30]  Horrendous.  I'm not...  Horrendous.  It was horrible.  It was terrible.  But then this is what I learned by watching the finale, because you're on it.  That's the only reason I watched.  Thank you.  And your new boyfriend, Trace, was also...  He is dreamy.  He is dreamy.  He's better looking than me.  Oh, he's got that voice.  And I would think that if any two guys would not go for better looking, it would be you  too.  There you go.  So, but here's my point.  The whole season was a ruse.  Yes.  Because Donald Trump hated you from day one, because of what you wrote in your book about 
[02:20:00]  him.  Oh, that's right.  He called you out.  So he was never going to let you in anyway.  No.  Do people know this?  He said it on the air?  He said it on the air.  Well, so I'm telling the people that maybe didn't watch the finale.  He basically said that he doesn't like you because of what you wrote about him in your  book.  That's what he said.  And then he said, do you want to apologize?  And I said, no.  Thank you.  And thank you for saying no.  When someone says to you, do you want to apologize?  It's the moment of truth.  Right.  That's the crossroad. 
[02:20:30]  And then I'm sitting there going, oh my...  He had no intention of having you win, ever.  No.  No.  There was no intention.  And there was actually fights with Walgreens and the producers who wanted me to win.  Right.  And they were much more pissed than I was.  Yeah, because they could have sold a lot more ice cream if you want.  Because in the end, it was a much better product.  And the other thing that I can't tell you who, but people involved in the production who  were so embarrassed ended up giving me that amount of money for the charity. 
[02:21:00]  Wow, they did.  Good for you.  They just said, this was kind of bullshit.  Let's write you.  Well, that's good.  So Opportunity Village made a metric shit ton of money.  Well, I hope we straighten this all out, Pat.  And you came out to Vegas.  I came out to Vegas.  And you didn't wear your baseball hat.  No.  And you're absolutely unrecognizable.  He did not even recognize me.  And I knew he was there.  That's our biggest fear, though.  When you guys finally give us an invite, we show up and we're like, oh, he doesn't even 
[02:21:30]  know.  No, no.  Once I knew you, I treated you with a great deal of joy.  You came back with great stories how you treated him.  It was fantastic.  And the show itself is just amazing.  I loved it.  I can't believe that your baseball hat is what I recognize.  I know.  I didn't have the hat on.  Because, you know, it's a classy jerk.  I don't want to be in a classy jerk with a hat on.  But what a great time.  And the show was so much fun to watch, man.  Someone came to the show, you know, and said, Vegas, after the show, they said to me, so 
[02:22:00]  you still hang out with Trace?  And I said, well, he's playing golf with my wife right now.  And he comes out and stays in the house and plays golf all the time and hangs out.  And then, you know, my family's going out to visit his family.  We get along great.  And we have no problems.  There's no problems between me and Trace, except you two.  Yes.  I said, why the fuck did ONA suck up?  I expected.  You know, I told you to put him on.  I told you he'd be good.  And I expected you to be cordial, polite, very, very complimentary. 
[02:22:30]  And then for one of you, I don't even care which fucking one, you know, either the whop or the  other one.  Either one of you.  Can't you either Opie?  You know, one of you would say, listen, man, you're really great.  But, you know, Penn's been on the show forever.  We got you to know that we're rooting for him.  His ice cream is a little better.  But listen, man, you are great.  You are fabulous.  Was that said it's ever said?  Yeah.  I mean, we did.  Yeah?  We did feel a little guilty.  No, it wasn't.  We felt a little guilty. 
[02:23:00]  It wasn't said.  We felt a little guilty after the show.  I think we might have a clip.  Is it short, though?  I don't want to waste Penn's time in a long clip.  Yeah, it's short.  All right.  A short clip from that day.  Oh, no.  We hope you win Celebrity Apprentice.  I do, too.  Thank you.  You just told Penn that yesterday.  No, no.  I don't even know.  I don't even know.  No.  I said it after we looked at his backstory that we have to go with this guy.  I did say that.  I changed my opinion, even though he's a really good friend of ours.  But how do you not root for a guy like this?  Penn's a really good friend of mine, too, man. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, but Penn has a sex dungeon.  That's all he's got going for him.  That's the Midwest.  Wow.  You know what the most important part of that whole clip was?  After Judas Iscariot over here kisses me on the fucking cheek,  he then, three sentences later, says he is a friend of ours,  and then this fuck beams in his chair and points to me like,  see, after I said I wanted you to lose,  I said you were my friend.  See, I'm an okay guy. 
[02:24:00]  You know, if you'd have sat there with your head down in shame  like the fucking piece of shit you are,  it would have been better.  But it's the point of the smile.  I'm sweating.  Point of the smile.  I'm sweating.  That was really telling.  You didn't have to interpret that clip much to see what he meant by it,  which was, I hope, Tracy was like, see, we're okay.  I said we're a friend.  He's a good friend of mine, too.  A good friend of mine.  A good friend of mine, too.  Okay, and since when does New York back Louisiana over Massachusetts? 
[02:24:30]  Since when has that happened?  In any sort of jingoistic, tribalistic thing, you're on my side.  But I never said your ice cream, I stuck to the point that your ice cream was better.  Thank you.  So, although friendship doesn't matter to you, gluttony does.  Penn, I don't want to throw Opie completely under the bus here,  but I have to say something.  Did you hear me in the background? 
[02:25:00]  Yes, I did.  I said, Opie, oh my God, you were saying that to Penn, you phony load of shit.  Yeah.  He was there.  You sold me out.  I was backing Penn the whole time.  I mean, practice this.  So, you know, I love you guys in Opie and Anthony.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I love one of them, man.  Oh, there you go.  And then you have plausible deniability as to which one.  One of them is great, man.  One of them is fucking great.  I swear I'm sweating.  There's something a little real about this moment.  I'm sweating. 
[02:25:30]  I have to tell you, and this is the really embarrassing part.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm telling you something that is humiliating, and you know that I often don't kid.  I just tell the truth.  I know.  Yes.  I'm standing.  We're playing like wherever it was, New Brunswick, New Jersey, right?  A thousand people have gotten my autograph, but I have to pick up my water bottle and my  stuff, and I'm just standing there like this.  And you're bummed.  And he's bummed out.  After signing, you know, it's like, oh, I'm famous.  I'm successful.  But something's bothering me. 
[02:26:00]  You'll leave here feeling a little better that I was only half the team.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Good cop, bad cop.  Yeah, you know.  I didn't feel good about Ant throwing me under the bus.  No?  No.  I'm doing a little research on my own here.  Did you put E-Rock on an assignment?  Maybe.  It's okay.  If you will.  Bear with me and just listen to this.  Thank you.  Chase has lived the life here, man.  The work ethic.  They're getting hurt on a real man's job. 
[02:26:30]  The country music star.  Weapons charges.  Jesus Christ.  It's fantastic.  How are we going to tell Penn Jillette that we're not rooting for him anymore?  I know.  You told him.  I'm all in with Trace now.  This is fantastic.  You asshole.  Did I say that?  I can't have Penn leaving here today thinking you're a good guy and I'm not.  I saw Trace, you know, because I had my sad moment. 
[02:27:00]  Sad moment.  Yes, yes, yes.  And then the very next day I see Trace.  And I didn't hear your fucking piece of shit show.  So I'm in the green room with Trace.  And I go, so I heard you had a good time with ONA.  He said, yeah, thanks for getting me on that show.  It was really great.  And I go, I heard they kind of, he said, oh, your boys sold you out.  He said, they are not your boys.  Let me tell you that right now.  Now, this, Trace is a friend of mine. 
[02:27:30]  So Trace, a friend, is telling me, your boys, they're just sold you.  Boy, I don't remember saying that.  You can hear the tongue in cheek in there, right?  You can, right?  You can, right?  You've been trying that argument since you were eight, right?  You hear the tongue in cheek.  Has it ever worked?  No.  Has it ever?  The I was just kidding, mom?  I've got to take an acting class.  No, he does that Wounded Warrior commercial.  It feels so good for him.  And he sings about the soldiers.  Oh, my God. 
[02:28:00]  He's got a dry eye in the house.  What a great American.  Guys?  Yeah.  Yes.  This is not what's making me feel the best.  No.  I'm sorry.  Oh, man.  You did come back today, though.  That's a good sign.  I did.  Okay.  Jeez, we had it all settled down.  You had to throw that out there.  I was feeling good.  I was telling stories that had nothing to do with that.  I know.  It was great.  You've got live TV, Penn.  Sorry.  Live TV.  I'm being yelled at.  Yeah, they're panicking.  Shaking his hands like, right.  Keep talking about Fund Anything, and you guys will be part of it.  Thank you.  Is Trace doing a Fund Anything? 
[02:28:30]  I'm kidding, Penn.  I'm kidding.  Let me say these really important words.  Yes.  You are forgiven.  Thank you, Penn.  I love you.  Thank you, Penn.  And Trace is very seductive.  He's a friend of all of ours.  I know, right?  Did you say that?  Isn't he?  We've got a new friend to see you.  Penn, thanks so much, man.  All right.  Thanks a lot, everyone.

You got to the top of the countdown.  I'm Sam Roberts, and if you missed any of this, then go back and listen to it again. 
[02:33:30]  Now, of course, you won't be listening again.  If you missed it, you haven't heard it the first time.  Number one this week on the countdown, the legendary Tim Conway.  Brian Regan, the comedian, was in studio with us as we welcomed Tim Conway.  We didn't know if he was going to be a sweet old man.  We didn't know if he was going to be quiet.  We didn't know if he was going to be shy.  We didn't know anything about him.  What we really didn't realize was that he would be a complete asshole.  Tim Conway makes fools of all of us here on the worst of the week countdown. 
[02:34:00]  Number one.  I was just watching McHale's Navy recently.  All those shows making resurgence on, like, MeTV and other cable channels all over.  And, my God, that was quite politically incorrect for nowadays.  But back then, you could have the hijacked Japanese guy on the ship with you.  No one cared. 
[02:34:30]  The Jap.  The Jap, they called him.  Yeah, they would.  It was amazing.  But, boy, what a funny, slapstick-y show.  Yeah, it was pretty much like the real Army.  Right.  Just like it, right?  During World War II, they were doing that stuff.  Hijinks and shenanigans with old lead bottom.  Yeah.  I was in the Army for two years and two weeks.  When you're a court-martial, they put that time on the...  Oh, they actually add that on.  Oh, that's handy.  I was on guard duty one night, and I knew the lieutenant was coming around. 
[02:35:00]  And it's the most boring thing to sit there from 12 to 6 in the morning with nothing to do.  So I took, I left my post, as you should never do, and I went in the back of a car and took a little nap.  And I forgot when I got out my rifle, which the Army is really annoying about that.  They give you a rifle and they say, clean it, sleep with it, and all that crap. 
[02:35:30]  But anyway, so I had to go on my post-its, our guard duty, and the lieutenant was supposed to come around.  And I realized I didn't have a rifle.  So I went in the trash bin and put out a long neon tube light.  And as he came around the corner, I said, halt, advance, and be recognized.  Give me your name, rank, and serial number.  And he started to do that, and he looked at me, and he said, what is that? 
[02:36:00]  And I said, it's a light bulb, and if you come any closer, I'll turn it on.  So I spent another two weeks.  Another two weeks in the service.  Penny rocks, yeah.  Was there anything you guys wanted to do on Caliburnette that you couldn't do because of network standards?  Or things that they wouldn't let her do?  Because 67, 68, or whatever, it was a lot different than today.  I'm sorry, you spoke a little too fast.  I do that a lot whenever.  No, no, we had no trouble with that at all. 
[02:36:30]  Well, Carol used to swear a lot on air, but for the most of us.  I remember that.  It was shocking as a child to hear F-bombs being dropped like that.  Even I was, yeah.  Yeah.  Embarrassed the whole.  No, we never had trouble with that.  Did you guys go out live, or was it a pre-tape?  It's hard to go out dead.  I swear to God.  Yes.  No, we were live, yeah.  Everything was live in those days.  Well, this is live, isn't it? 
[02:37:00]  Yes.  Yes, it is.  Unfortunately.  But it feels, there's something that feels really frightening about going out live like that.  And I guess it also, whatever the moment is, you kind of have to go with it.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  I just wanted to explain to Tim Conway how comedy was done.  What's wrong with me?  Why don't I shut up?  I wasn't listening.  How did you get involved with Carol best then?  I've met her once.  Not you.  I was on the Gary Moore show in New York, and she happened to be on the Gary Moore show 
[02:37:30]  at the same time.  And so when she got her own show, she said, I never want to have Tim Conway on the show.  Yeah, keep him off.  I showed up anyway, and she liked what I did, so I was there 11 years.  Wow.  You were there right from the start, right?  Yeah.  Well, no.  They didn't know it, but I was.  Oh, okay.  You were kind of lurking behind the scenes, waiting.  Yeah, I was pretty much, well, the first year I guested for three shows, and then they 
[02:38:00]  did 33 shows a year, and I did 32.  I would, and then I would save that last week in case I was a guest host on somebody else's  show, and they said, this is stupid, you know, do all 33.  And I said, well, I have to leave that week open.  And then I would do their show.  What were you doing before the television part of your career?  I wanted to be a jockey, so I went to Randall Park in Cleveland, trying to do that, but 
[02:38:30]  of course it this way, even.  Yeah.  Of course it's necessary to get off.  You could have been a jockey, for God's sake.  You think so?  Yeah.  When my comedy career is going, I might as well give it a shot.  That's what you're going to be plugging next time.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I'm going to be in Belmont's Pimler race.  Jim Norton's going to be over at Churchill Downs.  Wow. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, because I wonder how you got into television.  How would you make the jump from, were you doing, what type of comedy were you doing outside  of television?  I was dyslexic, so when I got up to read, people would laugh at me, and they thought  that was hysterical, so eventually that led to my just entertaining people.  That's bullying now.  Yeah.  Isn't it, though?  Yeah.  And that started your career.  So bullying's good, kids. 
[02:39:30]  Bullying is good.  I think bullying's good, yeah.  It gives people ambition.  Right.  Advanced my career.  Yes.  How did you remember, because we interviewed Henry Winkler, and we got it out of him that  he did play the Fonz.  We were a top-notch show.  How did you...  It's hard to get him on that, right?  He never admits it, but we got the thumbs up.  It was an amazing moment for us.  But he said for dialogue that he would just get the gist of it, because he had the problem  memorizing dialogue because of dyslexia.  So what did you do when you had to go after... 
[02:40:00]  How would you memorize dialogue?  He used to go, yeah!  He said, no, Fonz.  That was the original line, and he went, hey.  And they're like, all right, we'll go ahead.  Screw it, right?  The Zonf, was his original name.  So hard to get him to talk about that.  Yeah, yeah.  Get him out of his shell.  I'm sorry.  I forgot the question.  How would you memorize dialogue, or what would you do?  Would you just read it slowly, or what would your thing be to memorize?  Well, I have a photographic...  What the...  Camera? 
[02:40:30]  There you go.  It wasn't that difficult.  Sure.  I heard Gleeson had that.  You could actually look at a script once or twice, and you're pretty off book with it.  Who?  Gleeson.  He gets you.  He keeps nailing Jimmy with these things.  Who?  Say what?  I love it.  It's fine.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  I forgot the question.  And you. 
[02:41:00]  I'm very forgettable.  I really am.  I just, I fade like invisible ink as you look at me.  No, what was the, uh...  I forgot it, too.  Take your time.  Oh, do you really have a photographic memory?  No.  No.  It was kind of a joke.  Oh, I didn't.  You're very dead, Ken.  You're pretty sharp, I'll tell you.  Did you really want to be a jockey?  Yes, I did.  See?  I never know when you're kidding.  You brought this on yourself.  But at this weight, even the horse is asking you to get off.  Did I say the horse? 
[02:41:30]  You certainly did, but it's all right.  Well, quite like that.  I thought it was delivered differently.  You did, you know.  Yes, I did.  And I only weighed 105 pounds, so that was no problem at the time.  And my dad was training horses while he was cleaning up crap.  That's all.  So, yes, that was my goal in life.  Wow.  But falling off as much as I did, people get annoyed when they bet on your horse and you 
[02:42:00]  come across the finish line and you're not on the horse.  The jockey falls off the horse.  That's pretty much your bet's done.  At that point, you lose.  Yeah.  So, when you would, did you, and I know this is such a dumb question, but the greatest fear  is that you're going to forget a line.  And going out on live television, it's very frightening that you're going to forget something  and blow the scene for everybody, right?  Yes, it is.  Good.  No, no.  We'll be right back after this, ladies and gentlemen.  Tim Conway is breaking down and crying.  I'm a deep question. 
[02:42:30]  No, is this your first day?  It isn't your first day, is it?  No.  It is, actually.  Yes.  I won a contest.  They said interview somebody you know nothing about.  Well, you're doing good well.  You really are.  Yes, he's doing amazing.  What a good job.  Yeah.  I wouldn't worry about it.  And it was an ensemble cast, of course.  Was there any, because you hear about like SNL and the people are very competitive there 
[02:43:00]  and stuff.  Was there any competition between you guys on Carol Burnett as far as who got to go  out?  We're going to ignore you now.  I don't blame you.  I mean, after that crack question, you're an ensemble cast.  How come you don't jump all over him for his awful observations?  Wow, you noticed that Carol and Harvey were there with Tim?  Don't blow my candle out to try to make you a brighter.  We're going to make you a brighter.  I don't have one lit.  A pile of wax.  Again, I forgot the question.  Oh, geez.  Here's the answer. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  No, there wasn't.  No.  No competition.  No competition.  Just love.  I was a much better performer than her.  Well, of course.  Of course.  No question about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Harvey, of course.  Did they all start at the same time?  Because I know, I guess they brought Vicki Lawrence on a little later.  Vicki was on the original foursome, whatever it was.  Oh, well then, screw me running.  Yeah.  Again, another... 
[02:44:00]  You really don't know the time frame.  You don't have any of the facts correct.  Well, that's why I'm going to read Tim Conway's What's So Funny.  It's all in here.  Which is the book.  It's right here in this very book, What's So Funny, by Tim Conway.  Put that thing away.  And this...  What is this?  What is this?  Is this your entire career?  Because it's a little thin.  I don't know.  I haven't read it.  I haven't read it, actually.  But I'm looking forward to it. 
[02:44:30]  It looks...  Tim is doing some signings.  Oh, wow.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  He doesn't even know about this.  What is that?  Oh, you just go down and sign?  Yeah, you just sign some books for some people.  You're not doing anything.  You want to come down?  I'm busy.  Banter.  That would be nice.  No, I am actually doing nothing.  Really?  I can understand that.  I'd be happy to go to your book signings.  That would be cool. 
[02:45:00]  Is this your first date here?  It certainly is.  Tim just hurt everybody's feelings.  He makes people laugh on television and then just insults people and makes them feel bad about themselves in real life.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  That's right.  There you go.  Oh, Jimmy, you okay?  You okay?  Yeah.  I can't believe you're 79.  You're going to be 80 this year, Tim.  I'm 80 this year.  Wow.  In December.  That follows 79.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, he's still sharp, too. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, that's a illustrious career.  Got it.  Of course.  Important thing.  What are you working on these days?  Nothing.  Aside from nothing.  No, it's over for me.  No, it's over for me.  No.  Exactly.  This is my last show.  Sorry to hear that.  I wanted to close with this.  Yeah.  With this.  With this.  This and that whole career just culminates on this very program.  Hold on.  Good question.  Coming up.  Oh.  Here we go.  Look at this. 
[02:46:00]  All right.  Look at this.  Thanks.  He came around.  Yeah.  I was a fan of Mr. Tudball and Mrs. Wiggins.  Yes.  And the amazing thing about Mr. Tudball was how slowly you did everything.  And were you, is it frightening to go so slowly and not rush the laugh or rush the moment?  I guess the good question is after this one?  Yes.  This was one to get him going.  That was a shit question.  And then the follow-up one is a zinger. 
[02:46:30]  Please, I don't tell him my message.  It's an amazing message.  Oh, that's, again, I forgot the question, but yes.  I finally understand what Jimmy was saying, though.  Yes.  You want to kind of, the comic timing of the whole thing, you kind of, it would make you  a little nervous to have to do things so slowly and pull the audience along with you  like that until it gets funny.  To allow that to breathe.  Right.  Right.  Again, explaining comedy to the great Tim Conway. 
[02:47:00]  Well, I'm more asking, because that's a very frightening thing to allow, because I tend  to just rush.  Oh, yeah.  Well, like when you get a script like that, I mean, does it say that you're going to be  moving slowly, or do you look at the script?  Who is this?  Who is this?  I'm going to participate.  I'm going to be in on this.  No one wants to talk in this room right now.  Half an hour.  Do you read the script and then decide that you're going to, hey, I'm going to do this 
[02:47:30]  guy really slowly, or was this suggested to you?  I don't see this going well.  No, no, no, Tim.  I take some of the heat off Jim.  Thanks, Brian.  Go back to just listening.  So, Jim, what do you think?  Brian dove on the grenade there and just blew his guts out.  At least dispersed.  That was actually my good question, so I'm happy you threw it out there.  Oh, boy.  Hey, during McHale's Navy, were you able to actually go out on a battleship or destroyer 
[02:48:00]  like that?  Actually, it was cardboard.  It was cardboard.  I remember the cardboard.  It was on a railroad track underneath.  It was.  So, yeah.  So, it moved that way.  Oh, so when it pulled away from the dock, it was just going on a little railroad track.  Just going out into the middle of the lake.  But just because you were on the show, like you never got to, you know, like when Tom Cruise  did Top Gun, they took him up in the plane to show him what it was like.  Well, that was Tom Cruise.  They never took you out on a battleship?  No.  No?  Oh, man. 
[02:48:30]  No, I never had anything to do with it.  I was in the Army.  Yeah, you were.  Okay.  Much too long.  Was it during the big one?  Big what?  A hernia.  Anything like that?  Yeah.  You gave everybody a trust and you marched down the main street on Memorial Day.  So, I guess it was a little after WW2?  Oh, yes.  So, you lucked out.  I waited for that to cool down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You were hot.  That could have been...  What an understanding to cool down. 
[02:49:00]  You know.  Well, that global conflict to cool down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's an understatement.  Oh, so you were between wars.  Yes.  That's nice.  Very much so.  And you?  I just wanted to just listen.  That's good.  He jumps in once in a while.  You do.  Yeah.  No, I've never been in the military.  That's good for radio.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We allow everything to breathe a little bit.  We like silence on the radio. 
[02:49:30]  Wow.  So, okay.  You're in the military.  What?  Some kind of motor pool guy?  I picture you in the motor pool.  I was in special services, actually.  Oh, that sounds very secretive.  Yeah.  What is special services?  I don't know.  I had the combination to a safe, and I would open it in the morning and shut it at night.  And I was in charge of that safe.  Probably big secrets about the Cold War.  Oh, yes.  Well, we had the, we assigned people in Seattle to overseas, to Japan, and there was no conflicts 
[02:50:00]  or anything.  So, well, because the Japanese were hokey.  Imagine some guy watching television.  He sees you on the Calabernet show and goes, that guy had access to the nuclear codes and  didn't even know it.  I had access to the entire strength in the South Pacific.  Of the South Pacific.  Really?  And I used to leave the safe open at night sometimes, and I would go home sweating.  Really not. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  What's the matter?  You knew McHale?  That worked out a lot.  We weren't attacked.  Yeah.  I met you, I met you, I met you years, I don't know why I'm doing this, but I'm going to  try it again.  Jimmy!  I met you, uh...  You want to get close.  I just really do.  I just want to be friends with Tim Conway.  Yeah, well, that isn't happening.  Yeah, well, that isn't happening.  I met you and Harvey Korman together.  Wow.  You were doing Vegas.  I was on the late show with Dice.  Oh, yeah.  You were on the early show.  You were on the early guy, yeah. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, me and Florentine were on the late show.  I'm saying Florentine, I'm just throwing him into this, and we didn't get to see you  and Harvey because the tickets were sold out and we couldn't get tickets.  And they wouldn't comp us.  We could see your show anytime.  There are plenty of seats.  You could have laid down in the front row in a sleeping bag and just enjoyed it.  Oh, my God.  Tim Conway is a mean little bastard. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, my God.  No, I do remember those days.  Yeah, it was only about 10 years ago.  What were you doing?  Were you doing stand-up or were you just doing sketches?  I don't think it's any of your business.  What were we doing?  Yeah, stand-up.  Well, sit-down wasn't in vogue then.  So, you don't mind if I blow my nose?  I'd prefer it.  No, please.  It's one time you're not being mean.  Until he wipes it on you. 
[02:52:00]  Can you hold this?  Yeah, can you hold this?  Just throw some flu at you.  Drop some dollar bills.  Oh, that was just a napkin.  Jimmy.  All right.  Let's see.  What were all these names you have there?  These are all...  This is your IMDb.  IMDb?  Yes.  What did that be?  Yeah, yeah.  Internet Movie Database.  Oh, my God.  That's the history of everything you possibly could have done on television and movies.  Pretty impressive.  And you memorized this, obviously, because you want to talk about a lot of these shows. 
[02:52:30]  I did, actually.  There must be 50 or 60 things there.  There's a lot more than that if you go back to the other page.  You did a lot.  You were in Speed 2.  I'd like you to talk about that.  Okay.  Well, did you see Speed 1?  I did.  Yes, yes, of course.  Well, it was pretty much the same thing.  They just played it again.  Yeah, but in the water.  It was the big boat, of course.  Of course.  There were a lot of shows back in the 50s and 60s that featured comedians. 
[02:53:00]  There were a lot of shows.  There were a lot.  They started them.  The 60s.  I think everything on television was a show, pretty much.  And they featured a lot of comedians.  You know, if you look at Dick Van Dyke and, of course, what do we have?  Your show of shows?  Things like such.  You started it.  I know.  I did start that.  I dropped off.  I'm just wondering.  You don't see much of that anymore.  No, you don't.  You see, like, the single comedy.  You don't really see a bunch of. 
[02:53:30]  It's hard to explain.  Yeah, yeah, it is very hard to explain.  Yeah.  Which I just presented the exact thing of how difficult that actually is to grasp and put  into question form, which, of course, again, didn't even come to fruition.  Never came out as a question, Tim.  Let us pray.  Tim is impossible.  Tim's book, My Life as a Horrible Person, is now on. 
[02:54:00]  And there are book signings tomorrow if you want to meet Tim Conway in Huntington, New York.  Tim Conway.  Tim Conway.  That's exactly my point.  If you want to subject yourself to this.  Have fun.  Oh, my God.  Like, October 29th tomorrow in Huntington, New York.  He'll be signing on November 8th at Roman's Bookstore in Pasadena, California, and November  the 13th at the Barnes & Noble in L.A.  Will you be at the one in California?  I'll be at all three of them.  Yeah.  All three of them. 
[02:54:30]  You're just snapping photos and just watching people try to be friendly to you and seeing  them walk away tear-stricken.  Well, I've never enjoyed a show as much as I had this one.  Oh, look at that.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Definitely.  I was worried this was going to be a fluff interview.  Oh, well.  Not at all.  It was combat.  I know.  It's excitingly funny.  I'm sweating.  That's just my post-traumatic stress from an interview. 
[02:55:00]  Really removes all those silly illusions.  Remember those things we used to say, Lee?  Oh, Carol Burnett, that must have been a fun show to work on.  No, sir.  You can bet that wasn't the truth.  Tim Conway, thanks so much for coming in.  This has just been a pleasure.  Tim's book is called What's So Funny and a Comedy Legend.  I sense a rap up here.  Oh, yeah.  You were rapping on it because you just said...  No, no, no.  I'm not going anywhere.  Oh, okay.  I wouldn't have ripped this off if I knew. 
[02:55:30]  I was just doing that to be theatrical.  The interview was going to stop and stay out.  Oh, you're on TV, too?  Yeah.  That's great.  We're trying to get somebody a little friendlier coming up next.  So, Jake LaMotta.  Well, we do have to take a break.  Yes.  And you should.  Coming in.  Do you remember this picture, Tim?  I took a picture.  I want to see if you remember this photo.  Yes.  He hasn't shown it to him yet.  Yes.  It was a photo of myself and you.  And do you remember, I said to you, I walked up, and it was Carol, Vicki, and you, and 
[02:56:00]  I said, I love your show.  And you said, thanks.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Last nice thing.  Who's the whole picture, man?  That's me.  You're kidding.  I'm much better.  I can see that.  What are you, have you been sicker?  Oh, that's Vicki.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course, he's going to want you to sign that.  That can't be you.  It is me.  Did you go on a diet or something?  I did.  I've been just doing a lot of working out and stuff.  Eating better.  Eating better. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  That's great.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Okay.  Do you have any other...  You look a little better yourself, I'll be honest with you.  Have you a nice moment?  I'm going to share a nice moment with Tim Conway.  Watch how this goes.  Good luck with that.  Oh, it's going to get ugly very fast.  Well, I, unlike you, have about a week left, so...  Oh, Tim.  Oh, God forbid.  That's more than we were hoping for.  That's all right.  Let's say thanks to Tim Conway, everyone.  The great Tim Conway.  Thanks a lot.

[03:01:30]  This week, Jay Morris, more stories.  Yes, Judd Apatow in the house, Fake Mustache Studios.  But he has a real mustache and a real beard.  You're a bonafide hair suits man.  Well, the issue is that my beard and mustache are going gray, but in a weird way.  So I have a big patch of white on the mustache, which looks like I might just have snot on it.  But really, it's going gray in patches.  And as soon as the beard goes gray, I have to go back to face again.  Because I don't like looking at the gray face. 
[03:02:00]  Also, gray chest hair, I'm not happy with.  When I see that that's beginning to go gray, that's when I panic.  Mine's gray now, and I don't know why, but I love it.  You do?  Yeah.  See, I'm panicking about it.  I might literally go wax.  I might do the full wax.  But I think if I wax, literally, I'm just going to look like a woman with big boobs.  I think that the hair makes it look like I don't have boobs, because it fills the crevasse.  Oh, that's a good point.  But now, but if I remove it, I think I'm just fully revealed. 
[03:02:30]  Well, let's get real honest.  When you shave, when you have shaven to go full face, be honest.  How many times out of the thousands and thousands of times you shaved, have you just, you know,  just for a minute for yourself and your own enjoyment, just left the Hitler mustache?  Most times.  I do do that most of the times.  Yeah, you go, like, porno mustache, Hitler mustache.  I mean, eventually, it comes off.  You don't want to look like Michael Jordan in a Hanes commercial walking around with a bizarre Hitler mustache.  What was that? 
[03:03:00]  It was Hanes.  Like, he was doing an underwear commercial when he was in first class in the airplane.  Yeah, but why did he do that?  That was just, like, he was doing...  What was the premise of the commercial that led him to the Hitler mustache?  Hitler loved underwear.  That was the premise of their campaign?  That's a fact.  I mean, Hitler was like a stickler for...  It was just him and funny mustaches, and everyone was like, that's the chaplain.  Yeah, that's the thing.  Hitler really took away our right to say chaplain mustache.  Nobody has ruined anything other than him like that. 
[03:03:30]  Like, there's not, like, another thing that was ruined.  Or ruined anything worse forever.  Yeah.  Like, nothing has been completely wiped off the face of the earth.  Like, you could say, Billy Ray Cyrus ruined the mullets.  But yet, you still have mullet people.  But you can't go Hitler mustache.  You can't.  And you bring up a very good point with the mullet, because nobody ever says Bono ruined  the mullet.  But Bono was full mullet for a decade.  Like, Wide Awake in America and Red Rocks.  That was a straight Billy Ray Cyrus mullet.  I had a mullet for a while.  I didn't know it was a mullet. 
[03:04:00]  And I thought it was long in the back, tight on the sides, as I used to tell that my hair  business up front, party in the back.  Did you have a barber, like a neighborhood barber in New York?  I'm always just a go-to-anybody person.  Now, you know, I know someone who can kind of make me look less bald.  That's all haircuts are about now.  It's like, who can make me look less bald?  Well, but in the day, I used to just drive down Ventura Boulevard, and just anybody who 
[03:04:30]  cut hair, I would just go in.  You have more hair than me.  Well, maybe your hair's darker than me.  Well, in the back.  In the back.  Yeah, but who cares?  That's just like a flesh yarmulke.  That's fine.  But that's what's bad about certain TV shows, is some shows don't have a camera behind you.  But if you go on Charlie Rose or something, it's just a bald shot the whole show.  You've been on Charlie Rose?  I have been on Charlie Rose.  Those glasses of water?  No one ever takes a sip from their water.  It's almost like a Fincher movie.  Like, David Fincher directs Charlie Rose.  Just a perfect glass of water in the middle of a mahogany desk. 
[03:05:00]  It's cocky to pick up the water and take your time there, because you're in a black room.  I mean, the whole room has got, like, I don't know if it's black felt drapes around it or  something, so you feel like you don't know how long you're going to be in there.  It's very compressed time-wise, and you don't think you can lay back, because, like last  time I was there, the people who made that movie about the tsunami were coming in, and  you know they're out there waiting to come in.  You're like, but I want to do Knocked Up.  I got to tell you about Knocked Up. 
[03:05:30]  I want to take a glass of water and tell you some more stories.  Oh, you definitely don't want to hit the water.  If tsunami people are waiting behind you, just mock them.  Look how much water we don't abuse.  Look how we control water here.  I met them on the way out, and that's one of those awkward things where you really don't  know what to say to the woman who was in the tsunami.  You're like, this is so-and-so, and I'm in awe.  Surf's up, girl.  You know, I've seen the movie.  I'm in awe, but, like, what do you say? 
[03:06:00]  I don't know.  I guess just hi.  That's what I did.  I said hi, and then I walked out.  We're recording live from a construction site.  If you guys are listening to this in your earbuds, and now school buses are going back  and forth, my kids haven't been on that school bus in six years, but they stop at my house  every day.  I think they're spies.  You know, this is going to blow your mind, but I used to live in this neighborhood down  the street.  Really?  On the bluff there.  Your buddy Kevin Nealon's right here.  He wasn't there when I was here. 
[03:06:30]  He waited for you to move.  You know, if you guys were here, I might have stayed in the neighborhood.  I might have fought my wife when she said, let's leave.  And here's why we left.  This says something about my world.  In front of our house, one day, the street, like, on one side dropped like a foot.  And then suddenly there were, like, cones and surveyors out there.  And my wife said, there's something wrong.  Like, we're going to fall into the ocean. 
[03:07:00]  The street's going to collapse because it's on a bluff.  And then we would ask people.  No one really understood what was happening.  Like, why is the street dropping?  And then some people would scare you with their theories.  Where most people would just kind of hang out, my wife said, we have to move.  By the way, I'm not joking.  You'll see on your way home, all those cones and surveyors are still there.  Yeah, it's still there.  But it hasn't dropped more.  No.  So we moved eight, nine years ago because of that.  How far away did you go?  Well, we moved like a mile away. 
[03:07:30]  And then we moved another, like, five miles away.  But I love that house.  You're going to show me what house because that's like, if I ever did move, I would just  move to where you were.  I would just move 400 yards west of here.  Well, it's a beautiful spot because it's all ocean.  It's just, it's crazy ocean view.  But, which sounds great.  But what you don't realize is that it's just like a giant reflector for the sun that just  boils your house and that you literally can't look out the window because it's so bright 
[03:08:00]  all day long and your view ruins your life.  That's the difference between directing, writing, and producing movies and trying to get in movies.  You live looking at the ocean.  I live looking at lunch trucks.  Exactly.  That's nice, though.  You see the children pass by.  Yeah, Kiki's lunch truck.  And now there's Kiki's number two.  He's doubling up his business.  But you mentioned TV, so I guess we can go sort of linearly.  Freaks and Geeks needs to be spoken about because pretty much everybody that was involved  with it went on to be like, not stars, but superstars, yourself included. 
[03:08:30]  And it must bother you.  I mean, you're kind of ahead of everyone as far as what was cool, what was hip, and what  was good.  And shows like Freaks and Geeks that get canceled, do you ever look back and go, just want to  have a conversation with the person that canceled it and go, look who's above the title in  these last 18 movies.  It's all the people from this cast.  You had them.  They also live in this neighborhood.  I used to bump into them.  I mean, it must bother you. 
[03:09:00]  At the time, that was your whole life.  Oh, I lost my mind when all that was going down.  Now, when we did Freaks and Geeks, I had just worked at the Larry Sanders show for five  years, and I just thought, oh, let's just do the Larry Sanders show in high school.  That was my thought about it.  Paul Feig wrote the pilot and created the show, and in my head, any time we got stuck on something,  I would think, okay, imagine it's a Larry Sanders episode, but it just happens to have  kids in it in a high school.  How would they respond in this situation?  Who was Hank? 
[03:09:30]  Who was Hank?  Maybe it was Sam Levine.  But Paul, from the beginning, wanted to do something that was like a reaction to Dawson's  Creek, a show that wasn't about all the gorgeous kids and all their romances.  He wanted to show all the beatings he took as a kid and every humiliation that happened,  and he said, let's just do the crazy, honest high school show that's also funny.  That's about your friends and how you get through it because of your friends. 
[03:10:00]  Right.  And the network the whole time didn't know what the hell we were talking about.  Is that its demise, that it's so real?  Because the success of Girls, which is yours, is because it's so real.  And finally, we see average, everyday-looking people having sex in ugly ways.  And the real way, like when you have sweaty New York City apartment sex over the sink,  and your pants aren't even all the way down, you just pull them down past your balls just  to get it done.  Now that's the antithesis of everything else.  And now that's what's working.  So it is weird that the pushback didn't work then, and the pushback now is being celebrated. 
[03:10:30]  I think it was because it was kids.  You know, you could get away with it if it was Dennis Franz in White Pity Blue.  Yeah, well, he had some sex.  I mean, he...  No, I mean in the high school on Freaks and Geeks.  Yes, he would have.  Hey, kid, how you doing?  From Chicago.  I'm from...  I don't know if I told you I'm from Chicago.  Yeah, you've told me 40 times.  And so there were things on TV that I loved, but I think children's suffering was difficult  for people.  I mean, there was an episode that we did where Jason Segel wanted to be a drummer, and the 
[03:11:00]  whole episode was about him auditioning to be in a local band, like a cool local band  that needed a new drummer.  And it led to his audition for the band, and all we did was show that he's just not good.  And you weren't sure about that.  You didn't really know he wasn't that good, but then when you saw him with real musicians,  it was very painful as the musicians started looking at each other like, this guy's awful.  And then the show ends, and that's just the end of the episode. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  He's not going to make it.  Right.  And that, for television, was something that you didn't see a lot of, especially with kids.  Like, oh, their dreams are not going to come true.  Most of them.  And that's when the suits descend on you and go, maybe he can make the band.  Maybe he has the endings.  Why can't we have more victories?  Yeah.  Well, maybe they can get the girl.  They were mad at us because he got the girl and then decided he didn't like her.  Yeah.  So he got the cheerleader and then decided that she was awful, and he broke up with her,  so they didn't like that. 
[03:12:00]  Where Martin Starr caught the ball in the big baseball game, but then didn't realize that  people were tagging up and scoring.  Right.  He didn't know what to do.  So that was how most of those episodes worked.  And then I was crazy, and I had a herniated disc at the time and was on Vicodin and yelling  at everybody and crying.  Go on.  It was about as bad as you can get.  You did it early, though.  You got it all out of your system, and now you can just live life high on the hog. 
[03:12:30]  Exactly.  Yes.  I had my pain at the time, but there was also a sense of, well, what else can we do with  all these people?  They're clearly great.  What do you do with all of these people?  So we did Undeclared about college and used as many people as we could and then made movies  with a lot of the writers, actors, and directors from the show.  But it's, you know, I've said this before, but it is a little bit of a manic choice to  set out to prove everyone wrong person by person. 
[03:13:00]  But I loved everybody, and I thought, you know, I want to see a Jason Segel movie.  That comes from your stand-up days.  Yeah.  You got to prove everybody wrong, each member, individually.  You got to, I mean, that's probably just in your blood.  You were born a comic.  Yeah, I guess so.  It is like seeing that one person in the crowd not laughing, and you're just obsessed  on that person, but that person becomes show business.  Hi, I'm show business.  Table of one.  What, so I saw, I didn't know this about you until I just did like a cursory wiki.  I knew what I wanted to ask you, but then when I did the cursory wiki search of you that 
[03:13:30]  you wrote for the Grammys.  That's right.  Like, that's got to be the strangest gig in the world.  Are you doing punch-up for like when Stevie Wonder goes out?  Like, Stevie, it'd be really funny if you walked in the wrong direction.  This was the first big gig I had, was writing the Grammys with Gary Shandling when he was  hosting.  So, at the time I was doing stand-up, I was writing jokes for, I think I was writing jokes  for Tom Arnold and maybe Roseanne. 
[03:14:00]  I wrote for Tom for a while, and then that led to getting the job writing jokes for Roseanne.  Right.  Which was the biggest, you know, the biggest move up in my whole life was suddenly I was  on retainer.  I had like a yearly salary just to write jokes for Roseanne.  She wasn't going to let you out of her sight.  Oh, it was the best thing that ever happened.  Stand-up for the show, it was for her stand-up.  It was just her stand-up.  I couldn't get on the show.  I was just writing nightclub material for her.  So, I'm writing jokes for Roseanne and Tom, and then I remember this clearly. 
[03:14:30]  I met Gary Shandling at the Comedy Magic Club in Hermosa Beach, and my manager, Jimmy  Miller, said, you should let Judd write jokes for you.  I hear you need jokes for the Grammys.  Gary nodded, and then I never heard from him, and then three months later, I get a call that  Gary needs jokes for the Grammys, and I'm opening up for Kevin Rooney at the Dallas Improv,  and the Gulf War just started like yesterday.  And I'm such a bad comic that I don't even work it into my act. 
[03:15:00]  The war just started, and I'm doing the same hunk.  I'm not even addressing my material.  And so, I thought to myself, I'm going to write so many jokes for him that I'll be indispensable.  I'm just, if he needs 10 jokes, I'm going to sit here, I'm going to write 120 jokes.  Be undeniable, man.  And I remember staying up all night writing him so many jokes.  And Gary...  But were they music jokes?  They were all monologue jokes about music.  Now, this is how long ago it was.  Yeah.  One of my jokes was about Kiss as a reference of a band that used to be popular, because 
[03:15:30]  back then, they were in a fallow period.  And I think they've had three comebacks, and have been huge since then.  Gene Simmons is Colonel Parker to everybody else.  Exactly.  But back then, Kiss was not happening at all.  I remember one joke I wrote, which was, a lot of people ask, why I'm hosting the Grammys?  What's my connection to music?  Well, my girlfriend used to do the guy in Uriah Heep. 
[03:16:00]  So I wrote him hundreds of jokes.  And then Gary, who didn't know much about popular music at that time, he would just  rewrite everything.  And by the end of it, they were all his jokes.  I didn't have that many that survived.  But I got to go to the Grammys.  I remember when he told me he was going to take me to the Grammys to be there when they  did it in New York, which was one of the great moments.  What was the big performance at the end?  Okay, this is the Grammys where Jack Nicholson introduces Bob Dylan playing Masters of War, 
[03:16:30]  and the Gulf War just started.  And Bob Dylan does a punk version of Masters of War, and no one knows what song it was.  It was just indecipherable what he did.  And then, on the same show, Bono introduced a Lifetime Achievement Award to Frank Sinatra.  And so Sinatra comes out, and he clearly, you know, he's very old. 
[03:17:00]  It's close to when he died.  And he starts saying to the crowd, I wanted to sing for you people.  I wanted to sing for you people.  They wouldn't let me sing.  You're so nice to be here.  Why wouldn't they let me sing?  And suddenly, they just cut to commercial, like in the middle of him talking.  And then Gary comes back and makes some joke about how rude that was that they went to commercial.  And it was a whole hubbub backstage.  How do you cut off Sinatra during the commercial? 
[03:17:30]  Sinatra's still up there.  You know, he's kind of like half crying, like, oh, what happened?  You know, Barbara, what happened?  And it's traumatic.  And later, we found out that one of his friends was in the director's area, and he was there to tell them to cut to commercial if it didn't feel like Frank was clear-headed enough to do the speech.  Because you want old blue eyes.  You don't want old cloudy blue eyes.  Yeah.  Milky blue eyes. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  And so his friend said, cut to commercial.  I don't know if Frank knows where he is.  Sorry.  And then I remember Billy Idol did Rock the Cradle of Love, and they had the lady dancing behind the sheet where they'd have the big shadow of the pretty girl.  It might have been the year Tears from Heaven won everything.  So this is a real upper.  Oh, yeah.  Everything is like golf war, dead kid, Sinatra doddering, and forgetting where he is.  Tina Turner, I think, won something.  I remember where our little, like, punch-up jokes during the show area was. 
[03:18:30]  We had to leave for a minute because in the middle of a song, Peter Gabriel ran in and changed his outfit.  I mean, I remember every detail of it.  And I took a picture with Springsteen, me and Gary, Springsteen, and in the background photobombing, Jody Watley.  Don't you want me?  Was it Don't You Want Me?  I love Jody Watley.  I can't list all the Jody Watley songs off the top of my head.  That's a disappointment.  I'm going to imagine.  It's kind of the only reason you're in the garage.  It has nothing to do with all your great work. 
[03:19:00]  Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  First of all, you, we're going to get to the gals and all that stuff, but you, there's been many moments as a comic watching comedies.  And when I go through your IMDb page last night, I went, oh, my God, this is like 80% of every funny movie that's my favorite funny movie.  From Step Brothers to like Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Knocked Up, 40-year-old version.  It's like astounding, the output.  You're like Lennon and McCartney for producing and sometimes directing and writing hilarious, anchorman, hilarious films. 
[03:19:30]  But Paul Rudd sticks out to me.  Anyway, you pulled him from drama and I don't think people realize Paul was like a real, like I did 200 cigarettes with him and he was like an actor.  Yes.  He was a very serious guy.  From Shakespeare.  And now all of a sudden, like he's the go-to.  He will never miss a joke.  Nothing gets by him.  He can ad-lib his balls off.  He's like the funniest guy.  Even like Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  He's just like that surf instructing guy.  Yes.  It's like hysterical. 
[03:20:00]  Now, you obviously had to have known him prior to that to know that was in him or did he just come in and do an audition the old-fashioned way?  I didn't know Paul.  Shauna Robertson, who produced Anchorman with me, she knew Paul and I had met him briefly when I did that show Party.  Was it Dinner for Five with Jon Favreau?  We had that show.  But I didn't know Paul.  I saw him as just a great actor, a handsome guy from Clueless, and then he came in in full mustache and in the outfit for his audition for Anchorman. 
[03:20:30]  Not everyone came in dressed up from the 70s, so he was fully committed and had that character, just brought in that character and was hilarious, and that was that.  Anchorman is one of the auditions that you have.  Like when I auditioned for Champ Kind, and then when it goes to Koechner, you're like happy.  You go, oh, I couldn't possibly have done what Koechner did. 
[03:21:00]  Like they made such a, of course I want to work, but that's like the best, you know, other times it goes to like the Fifth Wayans.  You're not really sure who it is.  You're like, wait, what?  We're not even the same height.  And then, you know, but then with Champ Kind, Koechner getting it.  And I remember in my audition for Anchorman realizing I'm not saying whammy right.  Whoever gets this is nailing, whammy, it was just too, I don't know what it was, but it wasn't, I knew as I was saying it, if I was making this movie, I'd be like, he's really good. 
[03:21:30]  The beats are good.  The jokes are good.  But wait, he's not saying whammy right.  And then you see Koechner just whammy.  Koechner is so funny.  And it's perfect.  And in the sequel that Will Ferrell and Adam McKay just made, Koechner is so crazy.  Wait, they cut you out?  What happened here?  Well, you know, they wrote it and Adam directed it.  And I'm just a visitor, really.  I mean, I'm supportive, but it's really their vision.  And Koechner crushes in the sequel.  I mean, we were just very excited.  Everyone, I mean, they've spread the wealth really well, but Koechner really gets his shots in. 
[03:22:00]  Going backwards, forgetting Sarah Marshall, I'm a little obsessed with Russell Brand.  And I think his comedy is okay.  But any time I see him do panel or any interview, I'm stunned and alarmed at how smart he is, how sharp he is.  And he has a timing.  His tuning fork, he's tuned differently than anybody, but in the best possible way.  And then you see on YouTube, the listeners can, forgetting Sarah Marshall, Russell Brand audition, you guys ask him to just ad lib. 
[03:22:30]  You're just trying to get your girlfriend out of the room.  And that audition, I mean, you have to know, I guess I'm asking, I'm not going to tell you what you know.  But when you're watching Russell Brand explain horses and man meets beast and he just goes down that crazy road, you go, A, who the hell is this person?  B, can we get him on the cheap if we ask him to sign the contract right now?  Was it just done at that audition to play Aldous?  Well, his agent called me up, his agent is Adam Sandler's agent, he's a friend of mine. 
[03:23:00]  And he said, will you meet this guy, Russell Brand, who's coming to town, sent me some tape on him.  And I said, sure, you know, I'll meet him.  And I don't know if I got it completely from the tape he sent over.  And then he came in and was really funny to talk to.  Everything that you see, you know, walked in the door and you think, oh, well, this is a special, unique kind of person you don't see very often.  And then I went to call my friend Nick Stoller, who was directing, forgetting Sarah Marshall, and I said, I think I just saw a guy who might be great for this part. 
[03:23:30]  And he said, oh, he's coming in right now.  His next appointment is with me to audition.  And then he called me back an hour later and said, oh, yeah, we have to hire him right now.  So was there anybody else on the short list of Aldous Snows, or do you just leave that in the hands of the casting people? 
[03:24:00]  Or when you're producing this movie, are you thinking, like, you know, it would be really funny if so-and-so came in and actually could hit this out?  We had somebody all set to do it, and they fell out because of a scheduling problem.  Blair Underwood.  Exactly.  And so then we had to figure out what to do.  Fucking Ironsides.  Too big for his britches.  I don't think it was even a rock star.  I think it was supposed to be an author, a famous author.  And then we met Russell, and we said, oh, well, we can make him a rock star, and that'll work.  And Stoller was great with him because a lot of it is figuring out his cadence and how it fits in life. 
[03:24:30]  You have to slow him down a little bit to create a personality that isn't just Russell's personality,  that is this person, and still let him improvise and play and give you what he does, which is amazing.  I thought you guys did a really great job with it.  And I don't know if enough people realize it.  I can get him to the Greek.  He was so human, and he was so kind.  And Jonah Hill turned in the hilarious performance, in my opinion, and I thought Russell in the 
[03:25:00]  third third of the movie, I don't know how you director folks talk about it, in the last  quarter of the movie turned in this incredibly heartfelt, traumatic thing that was out of  nowhere.  I mean, I was impressed with it.  Well, he's a serious actor, and what the movie's about is partially about a guy who's  a drug addict, which Russell was.  And so he was willing to go there.  And I think when Nick would direct those scenes, Russell really came ready to play and was brave 
[03:25:30]  about showing how he felt in those types of moments.  But that movie, what we talked about a lot when we made it was, it was about, what do  you do if you're in a rock band and your lead singer becomes a crazy drug addict?  Do you end the tour and put him in rehab?  Do you ride him out for the entire tour?  You form Velvet Revolver.  I mean, that was kind of the idea is who's the person that says, let's stop and get this  guy healthy, or do you just finish the tour and Jonah's job was to make him deliver, even 
[03:26:00]  though he clearly needed to just go to the hospital.  Jonah drinking everything in that limo and smoking that, and when he finally shows up at  the Today Show, that was the scene of all scenes where I was like, okay, Jonah Hill,  check, like, I'm never, ever going to doubt a word this fucking kid says, that shit was  so fucking, I'm getting my smoke on, don't be a bitch.  It seems, I don't know why suddenly you become, I don't know, divisive, just like, you celebrate 
[03:26:30]  women so much in comedy, and you really go out of your way to make, to showcase how funny  women are, very deservedly so, like, with bridesmaids and with girls, and then when  you go back and read, and going backwards is treacherous on the internet, I know, but  then you read, like, about Knocked Up, and then you kind of take heat from Katherine Heigl  saying it was, like, a sexist set, and I really dug what you said, like, no, we're all, we're 
[03:27:00]  like idiots, we're children.  Yeah.  Like, that's how we behave when we're not prepared to be grown-ups or to have children.  I mean, do you feel vindicated with girls and with, you know, bridesmaids and stuff  like that, or is that always, do you talk to Katherine Heigl and ask her, like, why would  you say that about me?  Well, I always thought it was silly.  I can't say that when people talk about that stuff, it isn't annoying, but, you know, I  always looked at it like, you know, the first main job I had was writing jokes for Roseanne, 
[03:27:30]  so I felt like I was always writing, you know, for women, and I thought that the work  that Paul Feig and I did at Freaks and Geeks, Freaks and Geeks writing for, you know, Linda  Cardellini and all the women on that show was strong, so I never thought, oh, yeah, I don't  know how to write for women.  I mean, that's what I felt like some of our best work was, writing these characters, like  Busy Phillips' character, or Becky Ann Baker, who played the mom on Freaks and Geeks. 
[03:28:00]  So, it did surprise me, because what I was writing about was immaturity, and, you know,  what do you do if you get someone pregnant and you can't hang out with your buddies anymore,  and you thought you had about five years to party and lose your mind, and suddenly it's  just over.  It's over.  And your friends can't hang with you anymore, because that's what happened when, you know,  Leslie and I were, you know, expecting our first child.  I remember Owen Wilson calling me at two in the afternoon saying, hey, buddy, you want to  go-karting? 
[03:28:30]  I thought, no, those days are over.  Judd doesn't go go-karting anymore.  Go-karting.  You know, I can't go to the airport to go-kart.  Now, Owen has a kid.  He's not going go-karting, I don't think.  It makes me so happy.  Like, if it was golf, I'm like, whatever.  But the fact that it's go-karting makes me so happy.  And that's what the movie was about, like, having to instantly grow up.  And so, as a result, you know, you're trying to make Seth and his friends the worst people  in the world, and Seth the worst person to get you pregnant.  And so, inherently, in the premise, the woman is more solid, and, you know, she's career-driven, 
[03:29:00]  so the pregnancy might mess up her career.  And the pregnancy is messing up his life of mischief.  So, you know, sometimes people don't get the point.  That happens a little bit on girls, where people are annoyed by certain aspects of it.  I always think, you know, that's there on purpose.  That's supposed to be annoying.  It's supposed to be that she's a mess, and she's making selfish mistakes. 
[03:29:30]  That's not an accident.  Like, we don't know what's in there.  Right.  It is about the moment in your life when you're full of yourself and self-entitled,  and you're arrogant about what you think you can accomplish in the world, but you haven't  done shit yet.  And that's how we all were in that period in our early 20s.  And in Knocked Up, when I watched it, I never thought that the girl characters were shrill,  her word.  But I thought that the guy characters were abhorrent.  Yeah.  Well, she is the one who is doing the right thing. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  She's trying to figure out if he can handle it or not.  And you kind of, I thought, wrote it in a way, it was teed up in a way where, like,  if you ever get lost on how to play the scene, this is who you are, this is how they are,  this is the only way you would react to these guys ripping bong hits next to a crib.  And then it made me, when I overanalyze it, go, I think just she's shrill in real life.  The role was someone that has to deal with an immature person, so she has to be the stronger 
[03:30:30]  one.  But then you complain that the script got immature.  It's like when you got the script and told your agent, yes, I will be the starring woman  in a Judd Apatow movie, because you agree, this is what you agreed to do.  It didn't change.  It wasn't like on day 14, you're like, you know what, we're going to go another direction.  You're going to be like a nutty cunt.  And these guys are going to be like the everyman.  And we just can't figure you out, lady.  Like, no, it's exactly the same as when you handed in the draft, right?  Well, it was very collaborative, and she was really easy to deal with and hilarious the 
[03:31:00]  entire time.  So where that came from, I still don't know.  I haven't talked to her about it.  I hope she likes the movie.  I got a surprise for you, Judd.  Catherine, she's behind that.  But because I think she did an amazing job, and that's why the people like the movie.  And who knows?  You know, we do.  Well, you all do a lot of interviews and things get taken out of context or emphasized, you  know, and on any given day, you can emphasize the concern you have.  Especially on the Internet, people just, like, pull one sentence and go, oh, look, there's 
[03:31:30]  drama over here.  And you're, but what I'm getting from you is this is completely, it wasn't a rip on your  pond at all.  No, we haven't had a bad word about it.  But also, you know, all that matters to me is, like, I would hope as the years have  passed that she likes what she did because she did kick ass, and it would be sad if she  didn't have a lot of pride about what she accomplished in it.  It seems like in all of your movies, every time I watch a Judd Apatow movie, whether it's 
[03:32:00]  directed, produced, written, or all three, there's always one person, I don't know where  they came from, I don't know where, just, but it's like this new human just gets delivered  to me, like, well, Russell Brand, like, here you go, America, you're welcome, I'm Judd  Apatow, there's the guy.  And, like, Melissa McCarthy in Bridesmaids, it's just like, are you kidding, your wife  in Funny People, and that's, all right, I'll go back to that, in Funny People, that, is  that a weird sell to a studio to say, oh, yeah, my wife's going to play the lead, do you 
[03:32:30]  go in knowing people are going to, is there a built-in bristle, like, oh, now Judd's putting  his wife in movies, or is, because your wife did a great job.  Well, because her career was going much better than mine when I met her, so we met in the  mid-90s, and she was the lead in George of the Jungle, and she was, you know, doing movies  with Bruce Willis, and she was, you know, one of the leads in The Cable Guy, so that's  never been a question, because the studios have always loved to work, and we're happy 
[03:33:00]  about it, you know, there's certainly a danger in working with the person you care about  most in the world, because we're putting ourselves out there.  Yeah, and how do you give them notes in front of other people?  Well, that's not hard.  You're like, I would like you to play it this way, and she goes, well, I would like you to  stop gambling.  But we don't have to, you know, we don't argue too much in front of people about what  we're doing, we will, you know, we'll debate it in the house.  So, I'm not waiting to the moment we shoot to have the first chat about the scene, we've  talked about it for two years by the time we're in front of other people, and there's 
[03:33:30]  plenty of opportunities for her to say, why would the guy do that?  That is not, that's not truthful, here's what it would really be, and then we'd bang  it around.  I mean, luckily, she's, you know, she's hilarious, but she's very brave, and as far as I want  to push things, she wants to push things farther, so we never have any of those issues.  But I am terrified of just making her look bad, or making my kids look bad, because what  if I make an awful movie, and it's just a humiliation to the whole family? 
[03:34:00]  That's where it gets weird.  Let's say your wife's in, let's say your wife's the one shitting in the middle of the  street in Bridesmaids.  Is that something you'd go like, you know what, I'm going to let somebody else do the  shitting in the middle of the street, because I don't want my kids to see their mom shitting  in the middle of the street in Bridesmaids.  Oh, no, she does.  She loves jokes like that.  All right.  She has no...  But I'm just talking about you talking about your family watching the movie.  I don't think that's humiliation if it's funny.  Yeah.  You know, if you shit in the street and it's not funny, then I've done something terrible to  the beach this morning, I'm not going to lie to you.  I really did.  You have to. 
[03:34:30]  You have to.  But...  You have to.  But, so, you know, if the work's good, everything's fine.  But no, we're not precious about any kind of weird, you know, dirty things.  I've had her do all sorts of terrible things.  No, I mean, it doesn't seem that way at all.  It's just...  But also, going back to the point, like Eric Bana, like, that's a guy no one ever would  have thought Eric Bana was going to show up and funny people and be that funny, that  knuckleheaded.  Yeah.  And that, like, punch people...  Like, he's punching people in the face, but he's kind of kind. 
[03:35:00]  It's like...  And that's...  When I'm watching it, I'm thinking, that's, like, kind of hard to play.  Like, he's knocking people out.  He's protecting his home.  And then all of a sudden, it's like, hey, you want to go hang out?  Like, it's like the weirdest thing in the world.  And he loves his wife, and he cheats on his wife.  I mean, you know...  But somehow, he's likable.  He's likable because Eric Bana is likable, and that's where I start with all the casting.  You know, if somebody's likable, they can get away with anything.  W.C. Fields was likable, so he could want to hit a child, and it was okay. 
[03:35:30]  You know, Bill Murray can get away with anything, because we like him so much, so he can play  all sorts of all...  He hits children all the time.  I don't know.  That's on his wiki page.  Is it on his wiki page?  Yeah.  That's why he couldn't run for governor of Iowa.  So, I don't know what it was.  Eric Bana.  So, Bana...  I knew Bana from that movie where he played the criminal, Chopper.  He's in this incredible movie called Chopper, and he was a comic in Australia, and then  he played this...  I didn't know Eric Bana was a comic.  He started as a comic, and then he played this vicious criminal in this very popular 
[03:36:00]  movie in Australia.  So, I knew he could be funny, and then I loved him in Munich.  You know, we weren't joking and knocked up when we were saying how much we love Eric Bana  in Munich, and how he's the Jew that finally gets to kick ass.  And so, I thought, well, it'd be funny now to have him in the next one.  Yeah.  And then I went and had lunch with him, and he told me about his life and his interests,  and I found a way to put a lot of the things that he is interested in in the movie, like  Australian League football.  And then I started writing it to him.  I can never write a movie, because I can never sit with an actor and have them tell me what 
[03:36:30]  they like, because as soon as they just got off what I like, I would just tune out.  You're too selfish.  I'm completely selfish.  Oh, absolutely.  I want to, you know, I'm A number one.  But, yeah.  Well, that's good, though, because, like, for me, the issue is I care so little about my  own feelings that I'm only servicing everybody else.  You're not being a people pleaser.  You have a healthy enough ego about your own greatness.  I'm nervously trying to make everyone else happy. 
[03:37:00]  But that's the dichotomy in me, is I'm an egomaniac, but I obsessively need to keep everybody  around me happy.  Because if they're unhappy around me, then I'm not, my egomania isn't fed.  I see.  Like, if people are like, that guy's a dick.  I'm like, well, how am I a dick?  Tell me.  Let me rectify this.  Let me fix it.  And then you can think I'm really cool when we walk away and we shake hands and we're  bros again.  So you have complex egomania.  I don't know if anything about me is really complex, but I definitely have egomania. 
[03:37:30]  And then, yeah, an insatiable need to be liked.  When did we meet for the first time?  Was it at SNL when Adam Sandler was over there?  And I was visiting?  My school.  What were the years you were there?  92, 93.  93.  So that was right in the prime time of all those guys first getting to the show.  Lunch Ladyland.  Dang.  Who did you play?  I opted out because I was having panic attacks and I couldn't imagine myself dressed as a 
[03:38:00]  bean dancing in the background.  And then in hindsight, my wife and I still have this conversation.  She goes, I wish you were in like a bean suit.  And I'm like, I couldn't breathe.  I was having a heart attack and I was going to the emergency room telling them I was dying  and they kept asking me what drugs I was on.  I'm like, no, I'm not on anything.  I'm dying.  And they're like, okay, what drugs are you on?  I've had panic attacks.  Oh my gosh.  I used to have them.  I started, I was working on a punch up of Happy Gilmore and working really hard with 
[03:38:30]  Sandler and Tim Hurley who wrote it.  Timmy.  And I was, I just put myself under a lot of pressure that shouldn't have been there.  You know, I would think to myself, you know, this movie isn't good.  It's all my fault.  I mean, I'm just there to help, you know, polish it up and figure some things out.  But in my head, like, well.  But you earlier, you just said you never make anything about you.  But in this situation, you made the entire Happy Gilmore process about you.  Yeah.  I was people pleasing you by pretending it's not all about me.  Ah, you read my mind.  I doubled back on you.  Before we got there. 
[03:39:00]  And then I flew.  He's a mastermind.  Here's how my panic attack started.  I flew to a wedding.  I stayed up all night.  I didn't sleep.  I flew to a wedding.  And I'm watching the wedding.  And the bridesmaids get up.  And they sing Brian Adams' All for Love.  And I lose my mind.  Like, if you saw my brain, it just melted.  It just melted and came out my ears.  And I was gone. 
[03:39:30]  Like, in a very serious way for a long time.  And so I had to leave.  So I left the wedding and my cousin.  And I watched it through a small, like, hole in the door.  Because I couldn't be inside.  Because it was in a speakeasy.  Yeah.  And I didn't know.  And I didn't know what it was.  I just knew my heart is going 1,000 miles an hour.  And I'm claustrophobic.  And something.  I'm losing my mind.  Yeah.  It took me days for someone to tell me what it was.  I just thought, oh, my God.  I've gone insane.  Yeah.  And then I was on a... 
[03:40:00]  Then I had to fly home.  So I get on the plane.  So from where to where?  I'm flying from Boston to L.A. with a stop in Chicago.  And I'm flying home.  And on the plane, I get the craziest feeling.  Like, I have to get off the plane right now.  But we have another three hours.  And the guy next to me has one leg.  And he's singing Brian Adams.  And he's wearing workout clothes and drinking a lot of beer. 
[03:40:30]  And I'm like, how is he going to get to the bathroom?  How is he going to get to the bathroom?  And then I'm called my manager, Jimmy Miller.  And I'm on the phone with him for the entire flight.  And I'm just going like, I don't know what's happening.  You just have to talk to me the whole time.  I don't know what the guy with one leg was thinking.  Because I'm just talking about that, too, for three hours.  He's probably thinking, I wish I had two legs.  Exactly.  So I get away from this asshole.  And then we land.  And I don't know what's going on. 
[03:41:00]  I just think I'm tired.  I might just be tired.  I'm exhausted.  So I fall asleep.  I wake up.  And then I say to the stewardess, as I'm about to board the plane, I'm kind of nervous.  I don't know if I can do the next flight.  I don't know.  And all I wanted her to do was say, you know what?  It's going to be fine.  And instead, what she said was, on or off?  And I just went off.  And I literally checked into the hotel and got under the covers.  In Chicago? 
[03:41:30]  In Chicago.  I can't believe you're telling me this.  Called my therapist.  And then he explained what a panic attack was.  I didn't know what it was.  And I had to call a friend of mine and tell him to fly to Chicago.  To take me home.  I couldn't leave.  And I would have claustrophobia walking outside in Chicago.  While listening to Alanis Morissette's first record.  So I would listen to You Ought to Know while having a panic attack walking around Chicago.  But I didn't know it was a panic attack.  I thought I was just insane.  And then as soon as I saw my friend, it went away. 
[03:42:00]  And then I had it on and off.  I mean, to this day, I can't sit in the middle of a row at a play or something where I think,  Oh, if I get up, the actors are going to yell at me.  Brian Dennehy is going to go, What are you doing?  Yeah.  I don't want Bill Nighy to point me out in the middle of a...  That happened to me at Batman Forever.  I was at the premiere.  I'm in the middle of the row.  And I'm surrounded by everyone in show business.  Mike Ovitz and Michael Eisner and Nicole Kidman.  And I'm in Jim Carrey's row. 
[03:42:30]  And I'm sitting next to Gary Shandling.  And I just say, I don't think I can sit here and watch this movie.  I don't feel good.  And so as the credits start, I get up and I'm walking past everybody, bumping into all  their knees.  And as I pass Jim Carrey, he goes, Sit down.  You're ruining the movie.  I'm joking, but I'm actually having a nervous breakdown.  And then for years, as soon as I would start a meeting with someone, all I would think was, 
[03:43:00]  If I need to leave, how am I going to leave?  Okay.  I'll say I have to go to the bathroom.  That'll give me a break.  And then if I come back and then I really need to leave, I'll just tell him I had some  bad Pollo Loco and I think I have food poisoning.  Poor Pollo Loco.  And I would run that.  Pollo Loco does get a bad rap.  It is the go-to.  It's good.  It's good.  But it is the go-to like, sorry, we had Pollo Loco on the drive up.  Every time.  Yeah.  I mean, your house in Stone Canyon is nice, but we had Pollo Loco before we came in. 
[03:43:30]  I used to help I'm drunk at like 16.  My parents would go, what's wrong with you?  I had a bad Pollo Loco.  It was bad.  That was a Kennison excuse at one point, wasn't it?  Yeah.  That's what he said.  Dead Pollo Loco.  You're right.  But here's the thing my therapist told me, John Apatow, and that is you are a grown-up and  you can leave whenever you want.  You don't need anybody's permission to get up out of a movie.  People leave movies.  How many times have you been in a movie and somebody hasn't left?  We're in a play when someone's not getting up and leaving.  And my big thing was flying.  And she says, what is it about your panic attacks? 
[03:44:00]  And I said, it's just, I lose control.  I have no structure.  I need structure.  And she said, there's nothing in your life that's more structured than a flight.  You know months in advance when it is.  You know when you get on.  You know what time it's supposed to take off.  You know what seat you're in.  You know how long it takes.  You know where you land.  And you know where to go when you get off.  And when she said that, it went away.  See, that wasn't it for me.  It wasn't about structure.  It was just the randomness of me flipping out.  Well, that's what it is.  It's the release of life-saving levels of endorphins and adrenaline for no reason. 
[03:44:30]  When people go like, well, I have really bad anxiety.  It's like, no, you don't even know what Judd and I are talking about.  Anxiety is your boss rides your ass every day.  And then when you drive to work, you get a knot in your stomach because that guy's going to  ride your ass again.  A panic is you're watching Bridesmaids sing Brian Adams and all of a sudden you go, oh  my God, I'm having a stroke.  I should get out of here so I don't evacuate all over myself in front of everybody I enjoy.  Well, the thing that helped me the most was just the simple advice to not try to make 
[03:45:00]  it go away.  That that's like taking a mirror and just stepping on it and breaking it into a thousand pieces  to allow yourself to experience it and feel it and realize that it's fine.  And that if you just feel it, you can tell like, oh, it's just this.  But in the beginning, oh my gosh.  My Dr. Noel Taylor said no one has ever died from a panic attack.  And she pointed to all of her desk PDRs, whatever they are, all those books.  She goes, I got these in 18 different languages. 
[03:45:30]  There's not one reported death from panic attack.  Yeah.  So you used to get them in SNL as you were about to perform.  Yeah, I got one right before Farley's scared straight sketch where he comes out and is  like yelling at us all to not go to jail.  And he's like the prisoner.  He's all sweaty.  And at that time, I was prescribed Klonopin.  And you had one in your pocket all the time.  Yeah, always.  The little Klonopin pocket.  But they gave me the wardrobe, gave me pants with no pockets.  Like, I don't know what they were. 
[03:46:00]  And I remember like the panic just starts there.  But it's like I'm obsessing over the pants and the wardrobe department.  Like, what kind of people give someone pants with no pockets?  Like, what kind of, this isn't show business.  I need pockets.  Like, basically what the people that hold signs and yell about the government on the  corner begging for change, what they say is what people like you and I are saying  when we're in the middle of a panic attack.  So I held them in my hands.  And my hands were so sweaty because I was dying that I thought they were going to evaporate.  So I had to hold them just right.  Shake them around like a raisinette.  You don't want to melt.  Exactly. 
[03:46:30]  That's exactly it.  And then the costume people are like, Jay's turning into such an asshole.  He's like wants pockets in his pants.  He doesn't even need pockets.  Yo, they better have pockets.  But the thing was when Farley walked in, it's just the sun came out.  The clouds go away.  He was the most beautiful man in the world.  Is it true that Cable Guy was written for him?  Cable Guy was written for Chris and he wasn't available in a certain time period.  And I think some of those powers that be just wanted to make that movie.  And they offered it to Jim. 
[03:47:00]  Wasn't available because he was tied up with other things?  Or wasn't available because it wouldn't have been right at that time for Chris to be doing?  I think the SNL season was happening because we shot the movie in winter and he wasn't available.  But you carried a pretty great consolation prize for crying out loud.  Yeah, I don't know all the backstage politics of how that decision was made.  I was always trying to make a movie with Chris Farley.  Ben Stiller and I wrote this Revolutionary War comedy that starred Ben and Chris Farley in the mid-90s.  And we did a table read with Danny DeVito and Charles Dutton and it murdered. 
[03:47:30]  And we were so excited and we wanted Farley to agree to do it.  He had to do it for us to get it made.  And he just said no.  Wasn't into it?  He said no.  But then he did like that Lewis and Clark movie with Matthew Perry.  You're like, wait, that's the shitty version of what Judd had.  Oh, yeah.  I worked on a whole bunch of different ideas for Farley.  I could never get him to do anything.  And I didn't.  Do you think he thought it was territorial like you were Sandler's guy?  I don't know. 
[03:48:00]  I don't know why I couldn't crack the code of it.  It was a little more complicated back then, I think, to book people into projects.  There was more politics with the different agencies and management companies and what everyone's plans were for these people.  And I was a nobody.  I hadn't done anything that would make you think I would screw it up.  You wrote for the Grammys, bro.  I wrote for the Grammys.  You wrote Roseanne jokes.  I wrote three Tom Arnold specials at that point.  That's right.  Good man, Tommy.  But Farley was, I think, the funniest person in person that I've ever been around.  Ever.  And I don't think anyone comes close. 
[03:48:30]  And the energy he had, I don't think there's any, there's no way to even describe to people what it was like to sit in a restaurant with Chris Farley while he talked to the waitress.  The only way I could ever explain it, and I always go back to it, is it's the sun.  It's the sun.  And it burns bright.  And it can only end one way.  And I've never met anyone like you.  I never met anyone that made me feel the way I felt when I was around Chris.  It's the joy, like when you were a kid, you have that one uncle that'll just throw you in the pool for hours. 
[03:49:00]  You're like, he's the best.  But that time's a thousand because you're a grown up.  And Chris is just saying hi.  And it's just this light he would have and just throw on you.  And you just started giggling when he was talking.  And when just, how are you?  Well, my favorite Chris thing, well, there's no one favorite thing, but in any sketch where there's small talk, like a courtroom right before the gavel goes down, and people have to go like peas and carrots, hubbub, hubbub, Farley would go, murmur, murmur, spades, gay, murmur. 
[03:49:30]  That was, he would actually yell murmur because he would say in the script, murmur, murmur, and he would just scream it at the top of his lungs.  What is Judd short for?  Nothing.  And I have no middle name.  My parents didn't bother to give me one.  They gave my brother one and then didn't bother with me.  What's your brother's middle name?  Charles.  What's your brother's first name?  Robert Charles.  So how about you just take Robert as your middle name and just tell him, what are you going to do about it?  Come meet me in the Palisades. 
[03:50:00]  Let's throw.  That is possible.  Although I think my middle name now is, when I got married, my middle name is Mann.  I think it's legally Judd Mann Apatow.  My middle name is my wife's maiden name.  Yeah, so I think that's what it is now.  But, I mean, you would know.  You did the paperwork, no?  I did, but I never see it land in other paperwork.  Like, I filled it out, but I've never seen anyone send me something that said Judd Mann Apatow.  You do a voiceover for Fruit of the Loom and it just says Judd Apatow, you're not going to correct them.  Yeah, I thought it would be nice if it got out.  Now, I have to say one of the saddest things just about everything that's happening in modern comedy is that Farley isn't around to be a part of it. 
[03:50:30]  I mean, that is just a tragedy that it's hard for people to grasp what they're missing if he got to do this ride with everybody.  Yeah, Bill Murray's a guy, we have this discussion a lot on the podcast, as you know, you told me you listen to it a lot.  Like, greatest cast member of all time, like, after the fact, greatest cast member as they were there.  And you brought up a really interesting point. 
[03:51:00]  Like, you don't know anybody that was as funny as Farley in person.  Just if he walked into this garage right now, we would be here for four hours.  Yeah.  And he would, like, literally pick up an ashtray and put it up to his ear and go, huh?  And we would be dying.  Well, if he was leaving a restaurant, like, if he left first, he had to get somewhere, you knew as he walked by the window at the restaurant he was going to do something crazy.  Yeah.  Like, you would be terrified for the moment.  Like, oh, my God, he's got to pass by that window.  What is he going to do? 
[03:51:30]  And the last restaurant, he did the going down the stairs gag.  So now he's going to fall or act like he's getting choked out.  Or just talking to strangers.  You know, when everyone was first starting out, there was a lot of interaction with strangers that was hilarious.  Farley just walking up to a woman going, I'm in town on a convention.  I got 50 bucks and I want to have some fun.  What are you doing right now?  And that would happen all the time.  It went before they were famous.  Back in the day.  I mean, Kevin Meaney's HBO special, he went out in the street and talked to strangers.  Well, Sandler used to do this thing in the improv that made me laugh, which is he would stare at someone across the room until they saw him staring. 
[03:52:00]  And when they locked eyes with him, he would not look away or smile till they looked away because they got uncomfortable.  And then he would continue to stare at them until they had to check a second time to see if he was still staring at them.  While he's doing his act?  No, no, just hanging at the restaurants.  He would just look at someone and just go, and just stare at them like a madman. 
[03:52:30]  And you can't do that when you're a gigantic comedy star.  Friends of the show, this has been Jay Moore's podcast, Moore Stories.  For more info, go to jaymoore.com.
