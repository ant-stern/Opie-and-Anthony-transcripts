<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony After Show Live broadcast following a main show eruption featured a chaotic and eventful discussion centered around a major blow-up between E-Rock (Eric Nagel) and Opie.  E-Rock, previously known as “Sex Bagel,” unleashed a tirade against Opie, culminating in him yelling "fuck both of you," earning him the new moniker "Brass Balls Nagel." This outburst stemmed from years of simmering resentment, fueled by Opie's fat jokes and perceived mistreatment, including the regifting of a significant Christmas present.

The aftermath saw a flurry of activity in the studio.  Several impromptu guests, including SiriusXM employees and listeners who happened to wander by, joined the broadcast, contributing to the already-surreal atmosphere.  One listener, John, was notably perplexed by the unfolding events.  Rich Davis from the Covino & Rich show also appeared, offering his take on workplace conflict and expressing solidarity with E-Rock.

The hosts, including Sam Roberts and Roland, analyzed the listener reaction on Twitter, noting divided opinions with some supporting E-Rock and others continuing their attacks on Sam Roberts.  Later, Ron Bennington joined the show, providing commentary on the situation and offering insights into the evolving dynamics of radio and podcasting.  The broadcast also included promotional announcements:  a forthcoming Joe Rogan Experience marathon, schedule adjustments on SiriusXM's "The Virus" channel (adding the Joe Rogan Experience to the weekend lineup and shifting the Special Delivery show’s timeslot), and a brief discussion of Ron Bennington's celebrity anecdotes, including some skepticism surrounding one of his stories.  The entire After Show served as a raw and unrestrained examination of the fallout from a significant on-air confrontation, marked by unplanned guest appearances and a lively, if often contentious, discussion.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the O.P. and Anthony show continues.  This is After O.N.A. Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  It's After O.P. and Anthony Live.  E-Rock, you survived.  You made it, buddy.  It's not 11 o'clock yet, Sam.  Hey, Eric. Eric, you know the Scarecrow grew a heart?  He grew a set of balls.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Scarecrow, it was a brain for the Scarecrow. 
[00:00:30]  Oh.  Tin Man.  Yeah, same thing.  One of the four.  Well, I mean, if you missed today's O.N.A. show,  and you set your alarm to wake up with After O.P. and Anthony Live,  first of all, good move.  And second of all, you missed a hell of a show.  We spent about an hour and a half.  Was it that long, Roland?  Yeah, it was almost two.  Almost two hours putting E-Rock through therapy.  And Eric basically broke down, out of O.P. Anthony and Jim,  who he hates the most and why. 
[00:01:00]  For different situations, though.  But you did one overall, and you kind of ended up finally,  after what seemed like years, having it out with O.P. a little bit.  Well, they'll have to listen to the replay.  I'm not going to rehash all that.  Well, did you feel like what you wanted to get out got out,  or is there still stuff that you wish?  Oh, I think everything that I'm aware of,  I think everything that needed to get out got out to the three in that room. 
[00:01:30]  Are you the type of person who remembers things later,  like, ah, I should have said that?  Maybe.  I don't think there's going to be, I'm going to look back,  and I'm like, ah, I should have said this,  or there was something else I should have brought up.  Is it like eating pizza with whey washer cheese instead of real cheese?  What, not really as good?  Yeah.  Roland, you were in here.  Yeah.  First of all, I was watching you, Roland.  I fell asleep.  You're right. 
[00:02:00]  While this fight was going down, or fight or discussion,  whatever you want to call it,  I look over, and Roland is sitting in the studio,  in the air studio, on the couch, asleep.  What?  In my defense, I was in a pressure club, so he can't eat.  Oh, jeez.  You're not pulling any punches today, Roland.  I know.  So you tell me this.  How do you think it went down for E-Rock?  Eric just said balls, I'll say that.  You do feel that way.  He just, today, they kept him poking, poking, 
[00:02:30]  and then he said, you know what?  Fuck both of you.  You think he said a fuck you to Opie and to Anthony?  That's what he said.  Yeah.  Then he said, fuck both of you.  I'm like, whoa.  Troy and I looked at each other, we're like, whoa.  Do you think that this is, like, just an attitude he has now,  or is this a new Eric Dillegaff Nagel?  I think Sex Bagel is dead.  Now it's Brass Balls Nagel.  Brass Balls Nagel is his new name?  Sex Bagel is dead.  Brass Balls Nagel is here.  Were you jealous because we started this show,  and it seemed like... 
[00:03:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh.  What?  See this old guy walking by?  Yeah.  He just pressed his face onto the glass in here,  and he's, like, with his eyes wide and smiling at me.  He's smart.  Tell me to come in.  Come on in.  Hey, you old fart.  Who is he?  I have no idea.  I just turned to the left and there he is on the glass.  Hey, we're on the air, but you can come in.  Let's give my uncle a tour.  Oh, what's your name?  John.  John.  Are you enjoying the tour?  Yeah, I am.  Are we on the air now?  No, yeah, we're on the air. 
[00:03:30]  Hello, America.  That's Roland.  Hello, Roland.  And that's Brass Balls' Eric Nagel in the other room.  Brass Balls' Eric Nagel.  He caught you pressing your face up against the glass,  so we wanted to talk to you a little bit.  Okay.  And just say hi, you know.  Oh.  I know, it's weird.  This is after Open Anthony Live,  and what we do is just pull in from whoever's in the hallway.  Like, we, you know, comment on what's happening,  and you happen to be what's happening right now. 
[00:04:00]  It's just good timing.  Do people come in and actually do this?  Yeah.  Do they keep going?  There's Rich Davis.  Come on in, Rich Davis.  Come on in.  You get to meet Rich Davis.  I know, it's weird.  Rich.  Yo.  I wanted, this guy is on a tour of Sirius XM.  Oh, what a, what the, the best place to stop by.  Exactly.  And I thought, not only did he get some air time,  meet another Sirius XM celebrity,  Rich from Covino and Rich from the morning mashup.  Now, uh, is this, did you just walk in here?  No, I saw him, and I called him in. 
[00:04:30]  And they both looked at me like,  what, you mean on the air?  Because the light's on.  It says on air.  I said, yeah, come in.  Yeah, come on in.  We're hanging out.  Uh, E-Rock.  That's him, Sex Bagel.  That's his nickname.  He had, like, uh, the guy who sits here during the morning, Opie.  Um, him and, and, and Eric,  they used to be, like, really close when they started.  But today, on the, like, over the years,  the resentment's been building on both parts, really.  Where Opie doesn't like his performance and the way he behaves. 
[00:05:00]  And E-Rock is kind of, as he put it,  fed up with Opie's bullshit.  It's satellite radio.  And, uh, and so, today, they really had it out.  They spent, like, an hour and a half.  Was there anybody in your life  who you've had a conversation like that with?  Like, where you've been like, you know what,  this has been years building,  and it's time me and you had it out?  Uh, my ex-wife, maybe?  And look how that ended.  Well, I mean, 
[00:05:30]  is there anybody you'd like to say hello to?  My daughter.  That's beautiful.  What's her name?  Courtney.  Courtney.  And whose side do you take?  Sex Bagel or Opie's?  Sex Bagel, just tell Opie to go fuck himself.  He did.  He said, fuck you.  It's what he said to Opie.  And Opie's name is on the wall.  You're out of here, Rich.  You're out of here.  I'll see you later.  He doesn't work blue.  Yeah, he's tired of this.  So who do you take?  I'll go with the bagel guy.  Sex Bagel!  All right, well, thanks for stopping by.  What's your name again? 
[00:06:00]  John.  John, thank you for stopping by.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Give it up for John, everybody.  Give it up for John.  He is looking like,  what is happening?  What is this?  And what is going on?  Roland, have you ever seen an old man be so confused  of your life?  No, because he's trying to think,  what's a sex bagel?  You see, this is what happens when you go into a radio studio  and you press your face up against the glass.  You're going to get called out. 
[00:06:30]  If you want attention, I'll give you some attention.  So, E-Rock, how do you feel after today?  I feel better.  You do?  Because a lot of times after these big E-Rock segments happen,  you're a little down in the dumps.  Usually because, again, what led up to this is, you know,  fat segments, whale noises, those kind of things.  And to be fair, there were some fat jokes.  That was Roland.  To be fair, there were some fat jokes,  but you felt satisfied with the way the segment went. 
[00:07:00]  Did you feel like you came out on top?  Yes, I do.  I feel I did very well.  So you mean he crushed Opie?  Aww.  Is that what you feel?  No, because he's on top.  Oh, no.  I did, I did.  How do the people on Twitter,  because they plugged E-Rock Radio on Twitter a whole bunch of times,  how are they reacting?  Well, it's one of two reactions.  One, there's a lot of chip comments.  Chip bombing.  And then there's other ones that say,  I would love it if Not Sam was hit by a train. 
[00:07:30]  Why don't you choke out Not Sam?  Not Sam is the worst.  Shove your fist into his mouth for once.  It's weird.  There's so many people who claim that they hate me  for whatever reason it is.  Oh, it's called Facebook.  But, what?  Facebook?  Yeah, they have bad comments about you.  I've never, Twitter is what we're talking about.  Oh.  But there's so many people that have horrible things to say about me 
[00:08:00]  because they claim they hate me,  but they don't stop talking about me.  I don't know why.  I love to hate.  You'd think, yeah.  Is that what it is?  I think so.  Oh, here's another one.  I also wish Sam was hit by a train.  Well, I mean.  You're getting a lot of this.  Is Rich coming back in here?  Come back in.  Come back in.  Rich Davis.  Have you ever seen a more confused guy in your whole life?  Now, I can only imagine.  He was with an NFL guy, so he had no clue.  No.  He didn't know what.  He goes, he's looking around the room. 
[00:08:30]  Are we on the air?  He's whispering into the mic like he doesn't know.  Fuck, sex bagel?  What is going on here?  Roland said when he left, I said, do you think he was confused?  And Roland goes, yeah, he was confused because he didn't know what a sex bagel was.  Sex bagel?  What's going on?  I want to say hi to Courtney.  Right after, he probably dissed Courtney's mom.  Have you ever hated someone?  Yeah.  My ex-wife.  I don't know if you heard about this because you were doing the morning mashup, but E-Rock  and Opie have just erupted today in a sense because it just started unwinding. 
[00:09:00]  It wasn't like a big explosion, but it started unwinding where finally, and E-Rock's in the  position where he's ready to be honest because we as a show called him while he was on his  honeymoon and started making whale noises into the phone because E-Rock's fat.  He really didn't like that.  So he's been, ever since he's got back, he's been Mr. Does It Look Like I Give a Fuck 
[00:09:30]  Eric Nagel.  Well, E-Rock, is it also like a, hey, I'm an adult now, I'm a married guy, and you know  what?  Stop fucking with me.  I'm a grown-up now, Opie.  Stop fucking with me.  No, it's just, it's like, I'm fucking tired of this shit.  Of your bullshit.  Yeah.  Because he started as like, Opie's kind of like lackey.  In a sense, I mean, for lack of a better word, because he looked at Opie as a hero.  Literally, on his MySpace profile, it said, heroes, my dad, Hulk Hogan, Opie. 
[00:10:00]  Great choices.  And he was working here.  And Jesus was fifth.  And Jesus, of course.  You have a producer on Covino and Rich, Spot, who you kind of brought up with you, right?  Yeah, he's physically attacked me once.  So you see...  This happens because you know what it is?  As a host, you feel like the ability to just shit on people when you want sometimes.  Yeah.  And you don't realize that it's building inside.  Like, Opie probably has no fucking clue that all along E-Rocks is just fucking grinding  them, you know?  Because as a host, you're going to go like, oh, you're a fucking idiot.  And then you move on to the next topic because you're focusing on hosting. 
[00:10:30]  Whereas the guy in the other room is going, you just call me a fucking idiot and moves  on like that?  And it just festers inside him.  What are...  What about you, man?  You ever...  I mean, you've been working with ONA for quite a while.  Is there...  Yeah.  Have you ever blown up on anyone?  He's a Teflon kid.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't really blow up.  I get really like sort of these really underhanded, slimy remarks that kind of just keep creeping  back.  And also, I...  You shit stir it and it spins against somebody else.  Yeah, I'm really good at redirecting. 
[00:11:00]  For instance, today...  Too good.  Nobody even realized what I had done.  They were all making fun of my hair.  And out of nowhere, I made a comment about the shoes E-Rock wore on his wedding and everything  went to E-Rock.  Nobody even knew I did it.  Even Jim didn't know that I had done it, but he started talking...  No, I knew you did it.  You did.  You did, E-Rock.  Do you ever...  I mean, this happens a lot with probably your girlfriend or stuff, right?  Or like...  What set it off?  Because it's usually not something big that sets off the fucking explosion.  Like when something eats away at you, it's usually the littlest thing.  Like what set you off, E? 
[00:11:30]  He really doesn't like that Opie...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The big thing...  Well...  I'll go with the main thing.  Is that I gave him...  My wife and I gave him this gift for Christmas.  He's a big Islanders fan.  So it was from...  Not that big, apparently.  It was from...  These were guys from the championship team in the early 80s.  Yeah, they won four in a row in the 80s.  Professional photo.  Signed.  But now my boss is...  Framed.  Licensed logo.  Everything.  UV glass.  All done.  Generous.  Gave it to him. 
[00:12:00]  And it was...  By the way, it was like four feet by two and a half feet.  Custom made.  Islanders logo.  Custom put in.  Licensed.  But not the captain or the goaltender.  What did you get your dad and Hulk Hogan for Christmas?  What did you mail the Hulk survey?  And then what did Obi do with the gift?  He gave it...  He sent it out to his brother's house.  No, he didn't send it.  Oh, he didn't?  He handed it to his brother 18 hours after he gave it to him.  All right, he regifted it 18 hours later.  He didn't re-wrap it.  He just said, here, you want this?  This is it.  18 hours after he gave it to him. 
[00:12:30]  So that kind of set it off.  Also, we were talking to Roland...  Because this was like an hour and a half long today on the show.  You've got to hear the report.  I want to hear it.  It starts at 3 Eastern.  Roland, I wanted to come in just because Roland is very good in just like these tiny little  doses to just kind of give a little insight on what happened.  You might be my favorite part of the video that Obi posted.  You know the end of the world, people, May 21st, 2011?  Obi found one of them on the street yesterday and took out his video camera and tried to 
[00:13:00]  talk to him.  But the guy ran away.  He's like, I'm not doing this on video.  And Obi's chasing him saying, if the world's going to end on Saturday, what difference  does it make if you're on video?  But my favorite part of the video is probably just the very beginning when Roland's just  standing there going, hmm?  Because Roland just hangs out with Obi.  Is there...  Is there...  I mean, you're in his videos.  By the way, the video is on Obi Radio.  Do you think there's a jealousy that you get to hang out with Obi this much on E-Rock's  part?  I don't know because I have another Allender's plaque hanging in my room that Obi just gave 
[00:13:30]  me.  It was weird.  No, I don't think so.  E-Rock, we got to sneak in Joe Rogan and a break, right?  Yeah, we got time.  We can work Rogan in.  Do we have time?  Do I have to take a break now?  You could do Rogan now and then take a break, or you could do the break now and then do  Rogan.  It's up to you.  But I got to do both, and we don't have a lot of time.  Make the call.  Tough decisions.  I think I'm going to...  I think...  Here's what I'll do, Rich Davis.  I'm going to take a break now and tell the people... 
[00:14:00]  Oh, by the way, Mark Zito's in here.  Has Mark Zito ever exploded on you?  Because he was your intern.  Mark Zito...  Or he hasn't balled up yet.  No, he hasn't balled up yet.  The balls haven't dropped on Mark Zito yet?  No.  He still follows you around.  Zito, do you think you're going to blow up on either Ron and Fez or me or Kavino at some  point?  No.  Not even on Kavino and Rich?  No.  No.  No.  Your balls just won't drop, huh?  Neutered?  What about on me?  You can blow up on me?  Probably.  Little girl?  Little pansy boy?  You going to blow up?  Who's more of a talented young guy, you or Sam Roberts?  Say the right answer. 
[00:14:30]  I'm not getting involved in this.  He knows it's me.  No, I don't.  Oh.  Did you hear that?  He just whispers a crisp word.  What did he say?  I can't pee down the air.  The weird thing is, they gave me a show and they won't even give him a mic.  Do you have a caricature for yourself?  Yeah, but I didn't have to pay anybody to do it.  Listen.  Why are you nodding your head?  You don't want me?  Come on.  Defend yourself.  He's afraid.  Play some Ed Nathanson songs to get angry. 
[00:15:00]  I don't get angry.  We know.  We got to take a break and play Joe Rogan.  Otherwise, we're going to get in trouble.  But we're going to take a break and then play Joe Rogan.  That way, I can say, stay tuned.  Because Joe Rogan is coming up when we get back with After Opie and Anthony Live.  The O&A show continues.  Sort of.  This is After O&A Live.  Stay tuned on the virus.  Sirius XM.  What happened? 
[00:15:30]  It just lagged.  I saw it because your little arms waves sometimes.  Yeah.  You're like, what's going on?  It sat there and then all of a sudden, oh, there it goes.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm a bit tired because last night was a 675 bar.  Troy Kwan DJ.  You can't plug something after it's already happened.  It doesn't work anymore.  I was just saying, though, after every Tuesday.  You didn't go, did you?  No.  No, you didn't.  I've got to tell you something, Roland.  I saw the voice.  There was a little bit of chatter going on in the back office. 
[00:16:00]  Mm-hmm.  Not everybody believes your Michael Douglas story.  They don't think...  They think you...  We all know you met him because you got the picture with him.  Yes.  It's on your Facebook.  Correct.  I don't know if you want to...  Rolando's 99 on Twitter.  Yes.  So we all know you met him.  Yes.  But the story you gave was that you saw him.  Yes.  You walked three blocks with him.  Yeah, two, three blocks.  And then he gave you a hug, I heard.  Well, afterwards I thanked him and he hugged him and left.  And then there are people... 
[00:16:30]  Mm-hmm.  ...who will remain nameless unless they want to, you know, out themselves.  Okay.  But you could probably guess who they are.  Yes.  If it were me, I would tell you.  Yeah.  Uh, who thinks that you met him, you went up to him, you said hello, you took a picture,  that was it, and you have made this story out to be more than it actually is.  Now, Roland, this is not the...  When...  I met more celebrities than the asshole who doesn't believe me.  So they go fuck themselves.  So let me tell you, what stories do they have? 
[00:17:00]  Right.  I'm sorry, whoever doesn't believe me, go fuck yourself.  You were also accused of lying with the Charlie Sheen incident, if I remember.  You didn't like that.  No.  You don't like it when people accuse you of lying.  Look, I met more celebrities than whoever the asshole is that didn't believe me.  Why would I lie?  I don't care.  Like, if I could...  I met, um...  Let's see.  I met Brad Pitt.  It was only, like, for, like, a minute.  It was like, hey, hey.  That was it.  But you don't go around telling everybody the story.  No, that's my Brad Pitt story. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  But the Michael Douglas story, there's a little more to it.  The guy, yeah, he would say, thank you, thank you.  He'd appreciate it.  He was nice to everybody.  And he goes, here, thank you.  He gave me, like, the half-bro hug, and that was it.  So there is no lie to your story.  There is no lie.  If all I got was the picture, I would say, hey, I was walking, but I'm getting a picture,  and he walked away.  Right.  Like, what's the Zach Galifianakis story?  Because you have a Zach Galifianakis photo.  I was at Caroline's hanging out with the great, great Charles, and he walked in the back,  and Greg goes, hey, you knew Zach? 
[00:18:00]  I go, yeah, a long time ago.  When they're back, I go, hello.  He goes, hello.  And then Greg talked to him for, like, five minutes, and he goes, I got to get ready for  a guest spot, and Greg goes, do you mind if you take a picture of me?  And then I took a picture with Greg, took a picture, and then I go, do you mind if I  take one?  He goes, no.  And that was it.  That's it.  No exaggerations.  I said, good night, and left.  So you don't like this, you don't like being accused of being a liar?  I have no reason to lie with celebrities.  And what do you say to the people who call you a liar? 
[00:18:30]  Lick my ballsack.  Yeah, that's right.  Lick it when it's nice and dirty.  You prefer it when it's dirty.  I'll shimmy pants so they can lick it.  That's disgusting.  But I know.  But maybe they deserve it.  Yes.  That's what you're saying.  I have no reason to lie.  E-Rock, you are floating on cloud nine today, huh?  You are really feeling good about your appearance.  I was laughing at Roland's story, because that's really funny.  But you're airy today.  I like your vibe.  I like Brass Ball Z-Rock.  He just comes out.  Yeah.  Boom.  Fuck you. 
[00:19:00]  Roland, you're taking some notes from E-Rock today.  Yeah, it's like Pee Wee Herman.  I never met the guy before, the closest I've ever been.  He just walked by, and that was it.  I was like, all right, that's my Pee Wee Herman story.  Today is not the day to take shots at E-Rock, Roland.  Oh, I'm not saying.  No, no.  No, no, I'm not saying.  I'm sorry.  That was phrased weirdly.  I was just moving on to the next thing.  Because I was just thinking, sitting there looking at E-Rock.  Because, I mean, no day is the day to take shots at you, because you're vicious every  day of your life.  But today is not the day anybody should be taking shots at E-Rock.  He's ready to, E-Rock, you're ready for war a little bit today, huh? 
[00:19:30]  I wasn't expecting to go into that, but.  You're still in full soldier mode, though, I feel like.  I'll decompress at 11.  Don't decompress at 11?  I'm sure there's a fat joke there somewhere, but go ahead.  No, no, I would never.  No, I was saying for the people on Twitter who are still chip-bombing me and telling me how  much they hate you.  So, exactly, yeah, everybody on Twitter loves you today, huh?  Uh, yeah.  They didn't think that there was any orchestration on my part to keep that thing going so you  look better?  There's a lot of vile hatred towards you.  That's because people are, I said this on the air, too. 
[00:20:00]  The people who truly, like, hate me with their core are stupid people.  And I truly believe that.  You know what I mean, Roland?  Like, the people who write me and say that my skill level is such that it's low are dumb.  Like, they're stupid people.  Yes.  You believe that?  Yeah, I believe it.  Okay, good.  Good.  Iraq, are you with me?  Fuck them, too.  Or are you not on my side yet?  You gotta win me over.  You did send me the old fuck you today. 
[00:20:30]  Well, it's like in the movie Private Parts with Paul Giamatti, because they listen for  five, like, four hours, because the people that hate them.  Yeah, keep listening.  Keep listening.  Keep telling me how bad the shit hour is, and keep listening.  Now, Iraq, we really gotta do this, because we're gonna get in trouble if we don't.

[00:22:00]  Just click it, read the rules, and email something.  And as J.R. Perez in Tulsa, Oklahoma says, Sam, they hate because they ain't.  That's exactly right.  Now, uh, uh, E-Rock, the weekends are really starting to shape up.  Yes.  Fantastic shows on the weekend.  Jason Ellis.  And less special delivery.  Well, you didn't, why would you, I was trying to get, see, I was going to list the shows  on the weekend, and say they're great, and not mention special delivery.  Can you hear Jason Ellis voice?  Oh, Jason Ellis! 
[00:22:30]  What I was...  Joe Rogan!  What's Troy laughing at in there?  Such a delivery!  And many, many more!  What I was going to say is your weekends are now going to include such great shows as the  Joe Rogan Experience.  The Joe Rogan Dixner!  Kevin Smith Smodcast.  Smodcast!  Jason Ellis' show.  My show!  And a few other chumps who are bothering to do, uh, original shows on the virus.  This is the big news, though.  The Joe Rogan, uh, experience is coming to the virus. 
[00:23:00]  Next weekend, it's going to start in its regular time, which is going to be Saturdays  at noon Eastern, and Sundays at 5 a.m. and 6 p.m.  We'll just do Saturdays at noon Eastern with replays on Sunday.  But, uh, uh, Sunday, this coming Sunday, so in just a few days, we're doing a Joe Rogan  marathon, 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., all Joe Rogan experience, all day long.  So if you haven't listened to his podcast, you can do it on your radio, right here on  the virus.  Uh, if you haven't heard Joe Rogan's podcast, it's a great, it's a great show, and we're 
[00:23:30]  going to prove that right now by playing a little bit.  He has a lot of guests on all the time.  He's friends with our show, and our friends are friends with him.  Bill Burr was on the Joe Rogan experience not too long ago, so we wanted to give all  of you a taste of what you can expect when Joe Rogan comes to the virus, starting this  weekend with the Joe Rogan marathon on Sunday.  Here it is, a little taste of the Joe Rogan experience.  Bill doesn't like babies. 
[00:24:00]  That slurping, by the way, is just for all you cunts fucking getting angry that I slurp  my coffee.  I get all these people emailing me.  You should stop drinking your coffee and mute the microphone while you're drinking your  coffee.  It's so disturbing.  I can't enjoy your podcast.  I got to admit, that's one of my pet peeves when I watch a movie.  I hate, if there's a scene where the actors are eating, I hit mute.  I can't listen to it because they fucking, you know, actors, they got to make it interesting.  They can't just eat.  They got to, you know, we're going to fucking, fucking rob the bank. 
[00:24:30]  And they start throwing shit in their mouth and it drives me nuts.  Just the sound of somebody's lip smacking.  Or like when you're in a car with a girl that you just got in a fight with and she's eating  Doritos and you can just hear it like echoing off her skull, the crunching noise.  Someone's got issues.  This motherfucker's got issues.  Somehow he turned that into some of his own shit.  Yeah.  He went to his own life.  I have a fucking pet peeve.  It's a weird one.  But when I see someone eating in a movie, I secretly hope they had to do a hundred fucking  takes and they almost threw up.  Like they can't keep eating.  Because it just seems so forced. 
[00:25:00]  You know, you're eating while you're having this conversation.  You know, like what you were saying.  I'm going to rob this fucking bank.  He's got a mouth of, come on.  Yeah, they said point with the bread.  Yeah.  The shit you wouldn't do with people.  Yeah.  Who the fuck is pointing with their sandwich?  He'd be like, this guy is an asshole.  Oh, he's pointing his fucking sandwich at me and telling me what's going to happen.  Yeah.  You know, that's some weird intimidation shit.  You ever have someone fucking talk to you and in the middle of the way of talking to  you, they put a hand on your knee and squeeze your knee while they're talking to you?  It's like, what is happening here?  I got a couple of those. 
[00:25:30]  I remember one time I was shooting a pilot for some show that never got picked up.  And it was hilarious because what the hell happened?  Basically, they wanted an edgy show.  You know, these things always start.  So we give them this edgy show.  And right around, right before we did the run through, the Don Imus thing went down where  he said nappy headed hose.  So the industry gets so terrified.  It's not even just about radio.  Now it becomes about this frigging pilot.  So they were already nervous about the joke.  So we went in there. 
[00:26:00]  One of the first jokes was, I don't know, some homeless guy comes up and asks me for some  change.  I'm the liberal guy.  No, no, I don't want that.  The other guy was a Republican guy and he turns around and he flicks ice cream and it  hits him right in the face.  It was hilarious, right?  So they basically, they freaked out and then they didn't laugh at any jokes.  We're doing this run through and do it.  I'm telling you, we're absolutely bombing.  Okay.  Now to me, it's hilarious.  And it's not even that big a deal because I've bombed horrifically by myself.  I'm bombing with a group.  It's funny.  Way easier.  Yeah.  So I'm walking into scenes and the other actors, I see the deer in the headlights. 
[00:26:30]  I'm almost laughing.  And the more it bombs, the harder I'm committing to these jokes.  So anyway, so the whole thing tanks.  And by the end of it, you know, me and the other guy are like, dude, I'm getting fired.  He's like, no, I'm getting fired.  So we ended up going back to the hotel and everybody shows up to talk about it.  And, you know, the creators of the show all come walking in along with the director.  And I'm standing up.  I let him in the room.  The fucking director comes walking in, sits down on my bed and then reaches over.  I had some peanuts there and just grabs a handful and start and starts eating. 
[00:27:00]  And I just wanted to be like, yeah, dude.  Yeah.  Make yourself at home.  Have some fucking peanuts.  But I was so in that I'm going to get fired.  I was trying to be a nice guy.  And that's like one of those things that's slowly killing me is every once in a while.  Like, you know, it was like years ago.  I'll be driving down the highway.  What?  What in the world?  You've got to be kidding me.  Just listening to the Joe Rogan experience and all of a sudden, in walks the great Ron Bennington. 
[00:27:30]  No, you're still here for this show?  Yeah.  Okay.  Why?  I don't know how things work.  I don't know what the, you know.  Well, we've missed each other the past couple of days.  I know we're doing adjustments all the time around here, too.  Well, the Joe Rogan experience is coming.  That was the big announcement.  JRE.  JRE.  Is that what the kids call it?  You're more in touch with them.  Well, I'm street.  And I think you know what that's all about.  I mean, you've got to keep it real.  You can always tell people who are street because they start sentences by saying, well, I'm street. 
[00:28:00]  So.  I talk the same way as Fitty Cent.  He and I.  Fitty and I.  Nice.  I knew him since he was 49 Cent.  I knew him when he was a kid.  Wow.  And you guys both say the JRE.  Yeah, we do.  So what's happening with the show formerly called Special Delivery?  The show is still called Special Delivery.  Here's how the weekends work.  Yeah.  This weekend, it's the same as always, except on Sunday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. is a Joe Rogan experience marathon.  So if you tune into the virus on Sunday, you're going to hear the Joe Rogan experience. 
[00:28:30]  It's going to be lit up.  Yeah, everybody's going to love it.  It's going to be fantastic.  Then starting next weekend, Memorial Day weekend, Joe Rogan moves to his regular time, which  is Saturday at noon Eastern.  And yes, as you said, starting next weekend, not this weekend, the other stuff gets moved  around too.  So Special Delivery comes on an hour earlier, which is at 8 p.m., which is good.  Yeah.  But then ends two hours earlier, so 10 p.m.  So we're going 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern is the new time for Special Delivery starting 
[00:29:00]  next weekend, not this weekend.  Is there any reason for Dave even to drive all the way up here now?  I mean, he's getting $150 per show.  Okay.  I didn't know he was getting cash.  So this is why he's able to gamble like a crazy person.  Exactly.  And he's been keeping me up to date.  On Special Delivery, I now ask him every week where we're at with the Dave Ron betting  situation.  Yeah.  You got to update us all on that.  Now, here's the interesting thing, too, with JRE coming here, and then the WTF with 
[00:29:30]  Marc Maron, the other kind of podcast, there's two podcasts out there, Rogan and Maron, and  they're just...  Those are the two podcasts?  Yeah, those are the two podcasts, and from what I understand, they're neck and neck, like,  oh, we've got more downloads.  Oh, no, we've got more downloads.  But it's always JRE winning.  I don't know.  Well, I mean, but they're going to win now because you're not, you're adding a satellite  radio audience.  Right. 
[00:30:00]  So I have, you know, to me, that's almost like sellout.  You know, you come out...  Oh, you're like a hardcore podcaster.  Yeah, I'm a hardcore podcaster.  But at the same time that Joe Rogan has joined in 202, Marc Maron just did a deal with public  radio.  So both of them...  Really?  Yeah.  I think he's picked up in Chicago.  It was in the paper today.  By paper, I mean the internet.  I still call it the paper.  My mom calls the fucking refrigerator and icebox, and this is what happens.  Each generation.  But both of them have kind of, all right, podcasting means to an end. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Well, I mean, that's a funny thing, because everybody, everybody in radio is going, this podcasting  stuff, this is the future.  Yeah, get out as soon as you can.  And all these podcasters are going, I got to get on the radio.  Well, it's kind of, the podcasting thing, everything works out other than how do you  make money.  Yeah.  You know, you do everything, but we still don't know how to make money on it.  There's no big boss to pay us to do this.  Right.  So, A, you can do whatever you want, but B... 
[00:31:00]  I wonder if podcasters develop a sense of respect for sales teams, because, like, you  know, on your show in ONA, they have all these live reads to do.  A podcaster would love to have some live reads to do, because they'd be getting paid.  They would name their name after, they would name their show after it in a heartbeat.  Like the Morgan Spurlock documentary.  Uh, but, so now I think the number one podcaster is that Eastside Dave sports show.  You think, because JRE, in your opinion, as a hardcore podcaster, that's a radio show,  satellite radio.  He's not a radio show now.  And WTF is Chicago radio. 
[00:31:30]  Well, it's going to be a national public radio.  Chicago is, if you want to make it a public radio, you got to go through the Windy City.  You got to go through Chaitown.  Yeah, but that's terrestrial, right?  Yesterday's news.  Hello.  It might be yesterday's and tomorrow's.  I don't know how it all works out.  But, uh, so you're saying number one podcast is the Davey Mac sports program.  Possibly it's moving up there.  What if he ends up on the virus? 
[00:32:00]  Doing that.  Well, what would he get?  15 minutes?  I guess there's not a lot of time.  But, like, Dr. Steve gets to move up.  It's good news for Dr. Steve.  How did that work out?  Dr. Steve is now getting the 10 p.m. slot.  To what?  11 p.m.  He's doing the same hour, but instead of doing it at midnight, he's doing it at 10 p.m.  Will he still be answering about lumps on our balls?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, he'll be here on Friday, live in person.  He still talks to me on the phone, and he tells me how intimidating it was to interview you. 
[00:32:30]  I just didn't know when I was getting in there how nervous I would get.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, oh, yeah.  He couldn't.  He could barely handle himself around here.  Why is that?  Why do people feel nervous about me when I'm nothing but nice to everyone?  That's what I always tell him.  He's a sweet guy.  Have you heard Ronnie and Sammy's sweethearts?  He treats me like gold.  He doesn't have to.  They've got us down to, like, 8 to 15 minutes a day.  Are they just shrinking everybody down so they can fit more on?  They do.  Well, you start this.  It starts as you and the Opie kind of wrap-it-up show. 
[00:33:00]  Right.  You know, because they'll sometimes spend a little time with you.  Ant never does?  Very rarely.  He's gone on once or twice, but he's got a place to go to in Long Island.  Well, of course he does.  I didn't say.  I mean, for some reason now we act like Opie's homeless.  But, yeah, they each have a place to go.  Did you?  Ant said the funniest thing to me about you.  He goes, I hate that fucking kid.  That's not funny.  Wait, man.  I don't know if it was even you or Asama.  I know it was a couple months ago.  One of you is dead.  Could have been Bin Laden.  I don't know.  But, go ahead. 
[00:33:30]  I interrupted you.  Did you hear what happened between Opie and Iraq?  I heard that there was some beef today.  This is like two hours worth.  It's like a therapy session.  Let's talk about it.  Iraq, where are you?  Right here.  First of all, you're so tanned.  Thank you.  That's the Bahamas for you.  Now, what started this?  Well, it was all brought up.  Some of the ugly things.  Iraq changed after we called him on his honeymoon.  Yeah.  He really didn't like that.  And so he came back here with an I don't give a fuck attitude. 
[00:34:00]  Good.  WTF.  Exactly.  Mark Maritime.  That's what he said.  It's Mark Maritime in this bitch.  I'm Eric Nagle.  And then today, things started coming up about different gifts that he's given Opie, that  Opie has then in turn given away to his brothers.  Re-gifted.  Yeah.  I mean, not even.  Like, he bought Opie this giant.  We've talked about this now several times.  But he brought Opie this giant four foot by two and a half foot custom made, custom framed, 
[00:34:30]  islanders, signed picture with a custom logo and all this stuff.  A lot of thought, a lot of money put into this thing.  And 18 hours after Iraq gives it to him, Opie hands it off to his brother and says, yeah,  you can add this if you want it.  I don't need it.  All right.  And that hurts.  That hurt.  That hurt Iraq a lot.  And it hurt the entire Nagle household.  Well, but let me just say this.  And I know it's going to sound like I'm here to run Wingman for Opie.  But I don't believe in giving somebody something that they then have to hang up. 
[00:35:00]  You know what I mean?  In general.  In general.  If you give somebody something and say, here, I want you to find a place on the wall for  this.  Yeah.  Right?  Now, you've got to say something.  Opie is a family man.  So you don't go around and just start hanging up your...  Giant Islanders picture.  Yeah.  You don't do that.  You know, you're not going to like, oh, here's a Judas Priest poster.  Put this up in front of the family.  What about the Beatles of Comedy picture that Iraq got for you?  That's a different situation. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  The Ron Bennington, Ricky Gervais, Anthony Cumia.  I did not call that the Beatles, by the way.  I called it Bob Dylan and John Lennon.  Right.  There's a certain picture in my head.  That's what that is.  That that is.  So maybe...  So, you know, as you know, Opie's got a lot of brothers.  Yeah.  Tons of them.  I think he's got 40.  And re-gifting is very big.  All Long Island boys, too.  They're all going to love the Islanders.  They love the Islanders.  So that is a way, see, people end up liking that. 
[00:36:00]  See, here's what you want to do.  If you want to impress people, particularly your boss.  Yeah.  And you know what?  I'm going to tell you the truth.  I learned this from Jimmy Carter.  Oh.  But if you want to do something to get people to feel like, hey, that was thoughtful, get  something for their kids.  Genius.  Jimmy Carter was doing the Middle East peace talks.  Uh-huh.  It all falls apart with Sadat and, I guess it was Begin at that time.  I'm not sure.  It falls apart. 
[00:36:30]  He goes out and gets signed pictures of the three of them, his own kind of Beatles of comedy  picture.  Sure.  And had it dressed to all the children.  So it was signed by all three of them, this historic picture.  These men were so moved by this that they went back, sat down, did the peace agreement,  went home, both of them were murdered by their own people.  Wow.  But the point is this.  That might have got to Opie.  And in this case, you did the nicest thing that you could have done, E-Rock. 
[00:37:00]  You got something for Opie's brother.  Now, and I'm serious, because Opie's brother now, you know, he gets back for Thanksgiving,  and Opie's brother's always like, dude, I love my island stuff.  And then Opie's always like, yeah, I'm glad you do.  And then that reflects well on E-Rock.  It reflects back on E-Rock.  It's funny that you say that about the kids, because Roland showed up at Opie's house the  other day with the Justin Bieber balloon for Opie's one-year-old kid.  To this day, you go on Opie's YouTube channel, who's the face that's popping up in every  video?  I know.  That's Roland, hanging out with Opie nonstop. 
[00:37:30]  Roland is staying close to Opie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very close.  Very, very close.  I mean, I'm cutting into your time.  We got nothing but time.  Seriously.  Not a lot going on today?  Well, the only thing I got in three minutes, and I don't even know how we, Robert De Niro's  coming in.  Oh, shit.  So that should be good.  We want to come on with both of us, or?  Yeah.  Okay, great.  So where did this end up?  Because, you know, these are my two best pals.  Opie and E-Rock? 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Where do I rank on that list?  Well, I know that Dave knows you.  That's it?  Yeah.  Okay.  So, um, it basically, it ended where E-Rock said, the way it started was Opie said, E-Rock,  make a list of me, Jim, and Ant.  Uh-huh.  Who do you hate the most?  And we all kind of thought Ant was going to be number one.  Why does he hate Ant?  Well, he...  How can anybody hate Anthony?  E-Rock hates Ant second most behind Opie, because he doesn't like that Anthony goes home 
[00:38:30]  and forgets E-Rock exists.  That offends E-Rock.  But it doesn't offend him as much as Opie, who decides to cut E-Rock down at every turn,  is what Eric said, correct?  Yeah, he pays too much attention.  Yeah, you don't like that.  So, uh, I mean, in the end, they shook hands and walked away like men, but, I mean, I don't  think the hero worship that was once there is there anymore.  Can I tell you something?  Do you notice a lot of this changed when Rowling came in?  Two things changed.  Yes. 
[00:39:00]  A, Rowling came in.  Two, E-Rock got married.  Wow.  So you think those are the influences?  Yeah, though, suddenly, you know, E-Rock's like, you know what, there's more life to radio.  And then Rowling is like, no, there's not.  I gotcha.  I meant to, before we let you go to do your show.  No, I don't want to.  How are things with Laszlo?  Uh, it's a very strange situation. 
[00:39:30]  You were the shitster on that.  Congratulations.  It was on the Opie and Anthony show.  I just want to make sure everybody's aware of everything that's going on.  Uh, but you, I guess, brought it up.  He said he just, he actually kept calling me back on the air.  Did I tell you?  No, I haven't seen you since then.  So the day after we have that, uh, kind of brouhaha, I, uh, get up in the morning and  there's, uh, two calls from Laszlo.  So, uh, I live close enough.  I walk to work.  I'm like rocking out, rocking an iPod. 
[00:40:00]  Sure.  And, uh.  You're street.  Yeah.  And, uh, I look down and there's three messages all from Laszlo.  So I call him back and he's giving me a, hey, I hope, uh, you know, I hope we all know  it's just floating around.  I'm like, sure.  I don't know what's, uh, with Fez.  I go, you know, if you've got a problem with Fez, you've got to talk to Fez.  Yeah.  Because with them, it got a little hotter.  I don't even remember what brought it up.  And I thought he was going to be mad because Fez was saying some bad things about the game.  Where I was just saying, hey, this game is great. 
[00:40:30]  There's no lasers.  Right.  There's no robots.  Uh, Fez ended up saying your game sucks and everyone knows it.  Jeez.  So I'm like, I'm sure I'm going to hear about that because that's Laszlo's job.  Uh, but the, uh, thing that he wanted to talk about is they came up with his real name  is.  Right.  He wants to separate the two.  AKA Laszlo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I go, I don't know.  I, I, yeah, I know how you feel.  That's your real name.  Like when you called my, said my real name was full of shit. 
[00:41:00]  That's right.  Cause I'm Ron Bennington.  That's right.  I don't have to fucking see, uh, some fucking real genius movie in the eighties and try  to steal my name from the weird guy.  Yeah.  This is the name I was fucking given.  It's you.  I don't know why other people have to then panic and act like never bring up my real name.  Sam Roberts is the name I was born with.  That's odd.  I mean, you couldn't be born with them.  Just a more generic name.  I think it's broadcast friendly.  They let me keep it on hits one.  Well, yeah, it is broadcast friendly. 
[00:41:30]  That's what's weird about.  That's what's weird about being born with it.  Well, I don't know.  I like it.  No, you, you, you're taking this the wrong way.  You're getting very, very, uh, personal about this.  I don't know who those guys are.  You sound like you were born with a radio name, like a DJ named you.  Well, maybe my parents had intuition or divine intervention.  Um, how's your brother doing?  He's good.  He's looking for a job.  Still?  Uh, yeah, he had a, he had a job for a while, but it was temp work. 
[00:42:00]  And then what kind of work was he doing?  He was copywriting.  He's a good kid.  He's a very smart kid.  Yeah.  He is.  He's, he got the brains in the family.  I mean, he's, he's smart, but that's all I'll say.  I'll say, all right, listen, I got to get out of here.  I got stuff to do.  You have a show to do.  You could delay the inevitable all you want.  Can we do this?  Eric, could you just start going around with Opie in the afternoon and doing videos?  Like you used to?  Yeah.  Back in the old days when it was you and Opie making videos all day. 
[00:42:30]  Can you do that, Eric?  Sure thing.  All right.  By the way, I just want to thank you and your dad for all the cigars you've given me over the years.  Not a problem, sir.  Really?  You didn't give them away?  I, you know, I gave my fucking brother the stone cold fingers.  I was just falling backwards.  He gets nothing from me.  Hey, you get a smoke all day?  I don't believe in re-gifting.  No.  That's me.  If it's yours, it's yours.  Whether it be a cigar or what have you.  Well, Ron and Fez is coming up next.  What can we expect from Ron and Fez today?  It's going to be very interesting. 
[00:43:00]  I'm sure Fez will have heard the news about the elevator crash in Chelsea.  Okay.  And I'm trying to put that off as long as I possibly can.  How far do you think it's going?  How long do you think before you talk about it?  Have you ever been on an elevator with Fez?  No.  I don't think so.  He braces himself in the corner for the inevitable fall.  And I have told him time and time again, these brakes will never give out.  You don't ever have to worry about it.  He does that every elevator ride?  Every elevator ride.  It seems exhausting.  It's sheer terror for him. 
[00:43:30]  It's sheer terror for him to be in an elevator.  I guess it's a lot of stairs.  Did you just take the stairs on 57th Street?  I don't know.  Most of the time, we always took the stairs down because it used to take us so long.  To get the elevator.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was an annoying little fucking...  Remember, it was just a small building, a couple of elevators.  Yeah.  So I always tell Fez, you don't have to worry.  In Chelsea, yesterday, the brakes give out.  And the people plunged just like they would have dove down an elevator shaft, 22 of them. 
[00:44:00]  How far up?  Three floors.  It's not so bad.  Well, that's about the last point, I think, that you can make it before it turned into worse than, you know, a fender bender.  And I guess somebody who is, that's a fear, would say, well, if the brakes can give out at three floors, who's to say...  36 floors.  We probably shouldn't even be having this conversation because I'm sure Fez is listening.  It's freaking him out.  I don't want to do that.  Well, it's a little late for that now, isn't it?  I guess.  Well, special delivery is now condensed, packed.  Not yet. 
[00:44:30]  We still got another week of nine to midnight.  Here's what I like to say.  Half the shows with twice the jokes.  Love it.  Now, you're happy about this, but Dave isn't?  I'm trying to look on the bright side of things.  Dave is completely furious.  Is he taking it personal?  Yeah.  He believes that there is a mission to fuck Eastside Dave in the ass is what his quote.  I don't know if that's on paper anywhere, but...
