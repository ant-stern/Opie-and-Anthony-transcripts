<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a lengthy discussion about a disastrous dinner Opie and Jim Norton had with Bob, a business associate, and his wife, Robin.  The hosts recounted their elaborate attempts to avoid the dinner,  including numerous excuses from Opie, and Norton's comedic mishap of arriving at the wrong restaurant.  The conversation highlighted the stark contrast between their on-air personas and their behavior in a social setting, particularly their struggle to suppress their usual crass humor.  A major point of contention was Robin's reaction to their show, especially their use of the "C-word."  The awkwardness escalated when Norton showed Robin pictures from his digital camera, including a surreptitious video of a woman and, most notably, a photograph of a bucket of his own phlegm from a recent illness. This led to a discussion about bodily fluids and their varying levels of repulsiveness.  The segment concluded with a detailed account of Robin's potentially problematic email correspondence with another man, sparking a broader conversation about infidelity and relationships, with several callers sharing their own experiences, many involving truckers. Norton's lack of a girlfriend was also a recurring theme.

The show then transitioned to a segment featuring audio clips of Mary Jo Cody, the wife of New Jersey's Acting Governor, detailing her struggles with severe depression and recounting disturbing thoughts about harming her baby, including putting it in a microwave and drowning it.  The hosts, along with a studio guest, Ben, reacted with a mix of shock, humor, and disbelief. They speculated about the political ramifications of these revelations and the governor's marital dynamics, also briefly touching upon rumors surrounding the governor's predecessor, McGreevy.

Following this, Opie and Anthony reminisced about their early career struggles, detailing a disastrous Super Bowl promotion that involved awkwardly watching the game with a stranger's family. They recounted various bizarre and poorly conceived promotions orchestrated by their former station's incompetent promotion director, Roger, including a remote broadcast next to a giant Pop-Tart, the distribution of useless window clings, and a live marriage proposal in a limo. The chaotic and disorganized work environment at their previous station was also highlighted, mentioning the incompetence of employees like the mail handler, Eddie. The segment concluded with an in-studio interview with Tommy Chong, who discussed his past legal troubles involving the sale of water pipes with his son's company.  The show ended with a brief, comedic segment about Courtney Love's rehab stint and Neil Young's supposed involvement, including a snippet of a Courtney Love audio recording.

[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  I didn't even care where it was going to be. 
[00:05:30]  I got my email.  I saw the subject.  Restaurant.  Yeah.  Bob coming in.  Boink.  Delete.  I didn't want to know.  I didn't care.  And I'm running out of excuses for you.  You know what the excuse.  You know what the excuse was.  You know what the excuse was?  He never knows ahead of time.  Yankee game.  Well, that's the one I used.  I didn't get any sleep.  He shows up and he notices there's like an empty seat.  Oh, where's Anthony?  Oh, you know, the Yankees are on.  I mean, it's just, you know.  That's it.  At this point, I think he knows that you just don't want to hang out with him.  After I signed. 
[00:06:00]  In a social atmosphere.  After I signed the contract with XM Satellite Radio, that's it.  Why do we have to go out to dinner anymore?  He likes to have a little quality time with us.  Unless he's got something to tell me business-wise.  We didn't talk any business either.  We talked about all this stuff, but we did not talk about business.  No business?  Not at all.  And Norton's waiting for me in the wrong restaurant going, where the hell are you?  He's getting all mad.  Where are you?  He's calling my cell phone.  I'm like, what do you mean, where are you?  I'm right at the bar.  He's like, so am I.  I'm like, no, you're not.  Turns out he's at the restaurant next door.  All these metrosexuals staring at me. 
[00:06:30]  They knew I didn't belong and they were correct.  It was embarrassing.  I had to slink out with my awful coat.  His winter coat.  You didn't dress up for your dinner with Bob?  I wore a decent shirt.  No, no.  You know what?  Somehow we got to tape this.  Because Norton is a completely different person when he has to be.  What do you mean?  He's just really nice.  He's clean shaven.  He has a nice shirt on.  He's very polite.  Yeah.  He eats a lot better.  And good table manners.  That's what I was trying to say. 
[00:07:00]  He has very good table manners.  I understand that, though.  I totally understand that.  I've been in situations where you have to be the nice guy and you're on alert.  You're on nice guy alert for the whole time you're there.  Like dinner with a girlfriend's family when you're growing up and you're still in school  or something and the girl invites you over.  Dinner with the family and you're just completely aware of everything you're saying, everything  you're doing.  You can't screw up.  And you've got that dopey smile on your face like all is right with the world.  I'm happy to be here. 
[00:07:30]  I'm a gentleman.  You don't have to worry.  I'm going to stick it up her ass.  You know, you've got to be a nice guy.  The grandmother makes a little joke and you laugh politely.  Maybe add something in that makes them laugh in such a clean fashion.  No, nothing blue.  That's right.  Like you said, Hitler was an underachiever.  You know what I've been known to say at these dinners when you're trying to impress the other  family?  Oh, boy.  Chicken.  Chicken. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, boy.  Now, Bill, you're on your diet, Bill.  Oh, boy.  Bill, put the chicken down.  Love that movie.  Yeah, yeah.  So we're having dinner and Norton and I are looking at each other just laughing because  like we're getting just, we're burying each other basically.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  At one point, Robin's, you know, Bob's wife there.  Robin.  That's right, Robin.  Robin is going to Norton.  I don't understand why you don't have a girlfriend.  You seem like a really nice guy. 
[00:08:30]  So she does not listen to the show.  Oh, she listens to the show.  She's got problems with the show.  I don't like when you guys use the C word.  I just don't like that.  I'm learning way too much about you, Opie.  I thought you were a really nice guy.  I'm like, oh.  See?  See, this is what I hate.  It happens in my own family and stuff.  I don't want to talk about the radio show when we're not doing it with people like that.  You know, we know the type of show we need to do to get our audience.  We don't need like Bob's wife, you know, critiquing us at dinner.  We just don't.  Like if Bob's wife says the show is hysterical. 
[00:09:00]  Then I know we're in deep trouble.  Yeah, you're right.  But she's like, I just don't.  I don't know.  I don't like that C word on the radio.  I'm like, well, whatever, man.  The show might not be for you.  Well, I know it's not for her, but I'm trying to be polite.  And it's like, and I want my kids.  She's a mother of three.  I want my kids to listen to you, you know.  And I just can't.  And they're begging me to put the show on.  It's like, what are you doing?  Shouldn't be children listening to this program.  Oh, and Bob heard all the crap we said about him.  Oh, he did?  I thought he was on a plane.  He's trying to play it off like, ho, ho, ho, ho. 
[00:09:30]  It's just for the, I know it's just for the air.  He goes, why is my mic crapping out?  Is it the headphones?  It's your headphones, because I don't hear it crap out.  Oh, really?  Clear as a bell, Ope.  So, yeah, Bob heard all that stuff, and he's playing it off like, ho, ho.  I've been in this business a long time.  I could take it.  Yeah.  I know what this is about.  But he said it like three or four times, which means he can't take it, and he's really bothered by it.  Oh, no.  Because he knows we speak the truth when we say that, you know, that he wanted us to shut our mouths for the last two years so he could collect his 10%. 
[00:10:00]  Mm-hmm.  Because it comes down to money with everybody.  Who are you kidding?  So, then Norton breaks out his digital camera, and she's like, oh.  Were there celebrities around?  Is that what happened?  No, we started talking about it.  I had a couple of good ones from the Trump roast with me.  I forget how we started talking about it.  Because she's like, well, Bob loves to do that.  No, no.  So, like, getting pictures.  Maybe not how Norton likes to do it.  So, can I see your pictures?  And all of a sudden, in a panic, Norton's like, oh.  And he's, like, quickly scanning, making sure there's nothing too crazy in there. 
[00:10:30]  And this is Voss's cock.  So, then he realized it was safe, and they're going over the pictures.  But then it comes to a picture of a girl, but it's a video clip.  Oh, a little video clip?  And Robin's like, why do you have a video clip of this girl?  And what did you say?  Because I don't want to mess that up.  It was a picture of a girl.  And with the camera, what I had done was, I have, like, a little video option on my camera.  Yeah.  So, I pretend I'm taking a picture, but I'm actually shooting video.  An idea I got from somebody else. 
[00:11:00]  But I'm actually saying, see, I'm trying to get a picture of you here.  You having a good time tonight?  Just to hear the girl going, oh, yeah, this is great.  On video.  Oh, man.  Oh, not sexual to get sex, but you never know if some kook is going to freak out and  say that you did something bad, so...  How many video clips do you have on file on your computer?  Dude, I should have been doing it all along.  I've only done it, like, once or twice.  It's only with somebody who I don't know that well.  But this is what he does.  Yes.  You have to.  He gives evidence on his camera.  You don't have to.  You have to. 
[00:11:30]  If you're living a certain lifestyle, then you have to.  If you're living the Jim Norton lifestyle, then you are in a situation where you have  to take video clips and get alibis.  You have to get people, like, to just confirm that they're having fun.  Because you don't know.  Someone might feel guilty.  I mean, let's be honest.  They're not going to look at me and go, well, I'm glad I fucked him.  You know, I'm very realistic.  So, they might wake up and go, ugh, what was I doing?  Right, right.  So, she explains this to Bob's wife, and she goes, well, maybe you shouldn't be  inviting women like this up to your apartment. 
[00:12:00]  Oh.  And I'm sitting there like, God, she has no idea.  And I didn't want to blow up your spot.  Yeah, again, doesn't she listen to the show?  I didn't want to blow up your spot, and I'm dying to just let her in on everything.  Do you understand that these are mostly hookers that come up here, and they're  drug addicts, and one of them is going to freak out one time and say something to  try to get some money, and I want some proof.  Uh-huh.  But you couldn't say that to Bob's wife, so it was hilarious.  Nicest lady ever.  I know.  And then there's a picture of, like, puke in a sink or something.  No, that wasn't.  What was that?  I think you know how we do little weird things for the listeners? 
[00:12:30]  Because she was like, oh, my God, and she got all freaky and handed the camera back.  And I thought, because of what we were talking about yesterday, I thought it might have been  a picture of a girl gagging.  Remember the puke bucket?  Oh, yeah.  I wasn't sure if it was the actual puke bucket.  It is, the puke bucket.  That was the puke bucket?  It wasn't puke.  What happened was this.  I was embarrassed.  When I was sick, like, last week, I was coughing up so much phlegm, and I was just  spitting it.  Ah-ha-ha-ha.  Dude, it was two or three days' worth of awful moogers.  Oh, man, stop it.  I'm going to...  I got a picture right here.  Yeah, show Anthony the picture. 
[00:13:00]  It's not that bad, actually.  It's pretty bad.  But I was going to put it on the blog if I wrote about it or something.  I just wanted to have it, because you can't...  It smelled, too.  It had, like, that awful, sick breath smell.  Oh, God, stop it.  It's not that bad, Ant.  I'm telling you.  I got to drink water.  It's so funny that you get freaked out by this stuff.  It's not that bad.  It's not that bad.  It's fucking, um...  Snot, to me, is a close second to shit.  No, it's not even snot.  It's only, like...  See, it's just a bucket full of stuff.  Oh, God!  Damn it!  It's a bucket full of all... 
[00:13:30]  Spittle!  I mean, it's just like...  It's not...  Don't be shy!  Why is everybody so shy?  Jesus, that's disgusting.  She's got a little bit of color on that one.  Hey, um...  I just got an idea, really fast.  What's that, O?  You know that the Red Sox, obviously, are in the World Series.  What are the odds of getting World Series tickets for this radio show?  They don't get comments.  They just signed this massive deal with Major League Baseball.  Hey, that's right.  Someone get us a pair of freaking tickets to the World Series,  because I want to bring back the Boston Clam Shouter Puke Fest.  Oh, no. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, that was a good one.  That was hilarious, though, man.  Yeah.  That was so freaking funny.  We have to break that out for World Series tickets.  Our first contest.  Why not?  I know.  That would be great.  We made people eat Boston Clam...  We need really good seeds to the World Series.  We just have to do this.  It was the funniest freaking thing.  We did it for Super Bowl tickets last time around.  It was one of the funniest shows we've ever done.  Oh, yeah.  Just because of the reaction of Anthony.  He can't take it.  And these guys just...  Everybody just puking. 
[00:14:30]  One guy would puke,  and then other guys involved in the contest started puking.  It really is nothing funnier than someone gearing up to puke.  It was hilarious.  And everyone watching him is going,  Oh, oh, oh, oh, there he goes.  And then when it couldn't get any worse,  you had guys eating the puke,  which made other guys puke.  It was just so out of control.  Oh, yeah.  For more tickets or whatever,  there was a piece of puke.  Yeah, we've got to get World Series tickets  and bring back the clam chowder bit.  Yeah.  You wouldn't watch a porn video  like some of these Brazil scat movies  where the girls are like,  you know,  they're taking dumps on each other. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, I watch those.  But they're vomiting on each other, too.  I watch that, too.  Yeah, but it really...  It's so disgusting.  You can't watch those alone.  It's got to be with a room full of friends and stuff  because you kind of laugh.  Oh, oh.  Because it's a goof.  Yeah, that's right, right.  Yeah, no, no.  I forgot about that.  I thought I was like alone jacking off.  But you're right.  It was with friends laughing.  But, no, it's snot I can't take.  Really?  I am so...  I cannot handle snot.  If there was a snot video,  I wouldn't be able to watch it.  Someone told me about a mistress 
[00:15:30]  who blew her nose in his mouth,  which I...  Oh!  Oh, man.  I read that.  He's like,  oh, he went to the toilet.  That just got me.  She blew her nose.  She put his mouth on her nose  and she blew her nose in his mouth.  That's bad.  That just got me.  Because even my own...  You know, you blow your nose  and then you do the roll up the tissue thing  and screw it in there.  And then pull out a big rubber band.  I just can't handle it.  I skeeve.  I can't look at it.  I got to throw it away really quick.  You see Voss's...  Voss will pull out boogers  that should be hanging off a cave ceiling. 
[00:16:00]  And this dirty, awful man,  he wraps them up.  He has cigarettes in his ashtray.  So he'll just like...  He'll go...  And he'll laugh.  And then he'll just take the cigarette butt  and like trape the booger around it.  It's dope.  It's like he's making a pig in a blanket  out of a booger and a cigarette butt.  But he's the worst person alive.  He's disgusting.  He wipes his boogers on the walls and stuff too.  He's one of those guys.  He's awful.  He's an awful person from head to toe.  Anyway, so yeah,  Rob and Bob's wife 
[00:16:30]  was trying to get to know Norton a little bit.  Just can't understand  why he doesn't have a girlfriend.  I'm just...  It's hilarious.  Well, I'm always polite around wives or girlfriends.  You have to be.  You gotta be.  Because if I had a girl with me  who I like,  I want a guy to be polite or respectful.  I hate guys that just don't know the rules.  I'm a pig with you guys.  That's true.  And then I made the mistake  of telling Bob's wife  that I'm having a problem with dumping.  Why would you tell her this?  I don't know.  Because there was nothing else to talk about.  You've been at these dinners.  You start looking at the ceiling going, 
[00:17:00]  what can we talk about next?  I look at my watch and go,  oh, okay.  If I leave now,  I can be home by.  So she's like,  tell me more.  I'm a mother of three.  I can help you.  Oh.  So I'm telling her I can't crap.  She's giving you motherly advice  on taking a dump.  So then Norton is just looking like,  I can't wait to talk about this tomorrow on the air.  So I might as well say it first.  And then she's asking me,  well, what kind of food are you eating?  It might be too much fiber in your diet.  So I told her about the oatmeal.  And she's like,  oh, it's the oatmeal.  And then she's like,  I forgot what she told me to do. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, she said to eat fruit.  Yeah.  Dried fruit.  Dried fruit.  And I tell you the joy that brought me  when I realized that little faggoty snack  he brings in  was the source of his misery.  Like he can't take a shit  because of that oatmeal he brings in.  Yeah, you're backing yourself up.  It's like Elmer's glue  and fiberglass you're putting in yourself.  So then we're just discussing bowel movements.  You brought in more oatmeal today?  Yeah, he's hiding it over there.  Now you see it.  You know what's going to happen?  You're going to back yourself up some more.  You know, we have to.  I promised them we wouldn't talk about this,  but we have to.  That looks like the inside of my bucket, 
[00:18:00]  by the way.  You're opening up.  Thank God I'm just about done.  Okay.  We have to talk about what's going on  in their relationship.  What?  We have to.  Did we promise them?  I didn't promise them.  I don't know.  Is it sexual?  It's hilarious.  It's hilarious.  It's hilarious.  Is it sexual?  Well, I think they kind of gave us the okay  at the end of dinner, right?  Sort of.  Well, I'm trying to be cool. 
[00:18:30]  Like it matters.  With this new gig, I'm trying to be cool.  Let it rip.  Because I actually want to have friends  when I'm not on the radio.  Screw friends.  Let it rip.  The old show, it got to the point  no one wanted to hang out with me  because they knew we'd just talk about them  the next day.  There's a guy.  Yeah.  They live in L.A.  that really, really wants Bob's wife.  And Bob knows it.  Bob's not stupid.  Bob's a man.  He understands.  But Bob's wife thinks that this guy  is just being nice. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And Bob has to, like, tell her  to stop emailing the guy.  Oh, boy.  This doesn't sound good.  Bob.  Dude, this doesn't sound good.  No, I believe her.  It's like, she is just.  She's very nice.  She's very naive.  And very innocent.  I mean, she's a mother of three.  So she really doesn't really get what's going on.  And, yeah, the guy pretty much has come on to her.  How is there an emailing relationship going on?  Bob wants it to stop.  For some reason, it's not stopping. 
[00:19:30]  Look, anyone that's out there right now.  Hello?  You listening to me?  Anyone that's out there.  If your girlfriend or wife emails guys  on, like, a nightly basis,  they're sitting there chatting on AOL  or emailing back and forth,  getting emails from guys,  there's something going on there.  No matter what they say,  it's not some innocent little thing.  It's a relationship.  It is a relationship that can blossom,  that can go further and further. 
[00:20:00]  Thank God Bob doesn't spend much time traveling.  The guy's on the road all the time.  And Bob, you know,  Bob wants to beat the crap out of the guy.  And if he was taller than 5'5",  I think he would do it.  Because I think this guy's, like,  over 6'4", you know.  Is he handsome?  Supposedly he's handsome.  Have they traded pictures?  No, no, no.  How do they spark up a relationship  where they're emailing?  Their kids are in the same class.  Oh, God.  And the mom. 
[00:20:30]  Common ground.  Great, great.  This is good.  And this guy ran into Robin's mom.  I guess Robin used to know the guy.  Just, you know,  as an acquaintance back in the day.  Bob, Bob, end this quickly.  This has been going on for a while  because I asked for the update  and it was very uncomfortable  when it brought it up at the table.  I'm like, so what's going on with this?  I'm not going to say the guy's name.  Why can't you say his first name?  No, I don't want to.  Because I don't want to.  Just whatever.  Why is he famous?  I don't know.  No.  So, yeah,  so this guy asked for Robin's cell phone number 
[00:21:00]  and calls.  And then Robin takes a call  and, you know,  I think in the beginning  he openly just flirted with her  and she's like,  no, I'm not interested.  Thank you.  Anyway, I'm a mother of three.  I'm very happy with my husband.  I mean, she's playing it perfectly.  I mean, she's not interested.  I swear to you.  Okay?  Yeah.  But the guy will not give up on it  and starts emailing her  and calling her anyway.  And then Robin,  trying to get out of this, 
[00:21:30]  set this creep,  she calls him the creep,  up with her friends.  And so he's going out with her friends  but still not happy  and it's not working out.  And then I guess Bob took his wife  on a romantic getaway  for their 10-year anniversary  up to the Napa Valley.  Yeah.  And as they're driving,  her cell phone rings.  No.  Yeah.  Her cell phone rings.  And it's on the speaker phone  in the car  and it's this guy.  How did he get the cell phone number?  He's had it.  How? 
[00:22:00]  Why?  From Robin's mom,  I do believe.  What?  No.  This, no.  Well, we talked about that.  My mom gave my number  out to my ex-psycho girlfriend.  Dude, here's the rule of thumb.  They don't understand.  They're like,  oh, you want to say how to Robin?  That's enough evidence right there.  Here's the rule of thumb  you've got to go by,  guys and girls.  If you know for sure  that your mate  isn't cheating on you,  they might be cheating on you.  Now, if you think  that your mate  is cheating on you, 
[00:22:30]  they are cheating on you.  That's how it works.  I could speak for Robin.  She's not cheating on Bob  and has no intention to.  But I think, personally,  I think she kind of likes  the attention.  A little bit of the attention  that's going on.  You know how these things,  they grow out of control.  It's a virus.  It's like this show.  And that's what Bob's  paranoid about.  Right, and he very well  should be.  He's a little worried.  He's like, you know,  he wants...  These things don't stay  where they are static.  He wants to nip in the butt,  as they say,  but, you know, 
[00:23:00]  they're running into him  at all the school functions.  Of course.  You know, it's not like  this guy's from another city  or another town.  Oh, this is bad.  Poor Bob.  He's in the same community.  Oh, poor Bob.  This is bad.  I think Bob was okay with it.  And then he realized  that his wife is really hot  and he walked by a mirror  and he's like, uh-oh.  I better do something here.  Because I don't know  how Bob pulled that off.  I think Bob,  that's why Bob grew the beard.  Oh, do you think it's...  I think he's trying  to look sexier.  Trying to be a little more hip.  I think he's trying  to look sexier.  He saw some, like,  Kirk Douglas movie 
[00:23:30]  from the mid-70s.  He's like,  yeah, that's the look.  He's going to trade in  the Vista Cruiser for a vet.  He's going to be all hip.  Get an earring like Ed Bradley.  Oh!  It's the earring.  Get a tat.  Yeah.  He's got to get a tat.  It's just very interesting  what's going on, though,  with this whole thing.  Start working out.  Get all buff.  What kind of tattoo  could he possibly get?  A lawyer with a thumbs up?  But there's frustration...  The dollar sign.  Yeah.  There's frustration  in Bob's voice  because he knows  what this is all about.  Of course he does.  He has no doubt  in his mind.  And she is like, 
[00:24:00]  no, he's just being nice.  No.  He's a little creepy,  but he's just being nice.  No.  First of all,  a guy in that situation,  he's always looking  to take it further,  always looking for the score,  which is to get laid.  That's the goal.  That's the goal.  He's not doing this  to just be friendly  and have this little  platonic conversation thing  on the internet.  It's not that way.  They look for the final goal  is to get laid.  Yep.  And the women  are maybe looking  for a little companionship,  some conversation, 
[00:24:30]  something outside  the humdrum  of married life  and raising kids.  It's a little bit exciting.  It's someone different.  And that can take off.  That can launch.  If the guy's smooth  and starts talking,  they got the rap.  Hey, look,  I'm not talking about  something that's  never happened here.  Stuff like this  happens all the time.  Well, Chris Rockett...  He has to nip this  in the bus.  Chris Rockett has  that great bit.  Oh, I know.  The platonic friendship.  The platonic friendship. 
[00:25:00]  It's BS.  The dick behind the glass.  In case of emergency,  break glass.  Well, you're saying basically  is if this guy, right,  has some type of  a smooth guinea voice  and olive oil charm.  Nice.  I know what you're saying.  Now you'll get  the hell out of here.  Hey, there was...  I ain't no agent.  I heard that story.  Really fast?  His name is Bob Eatman  and he bores my father.  Really fast,  the NYPD  put in a request  on the email. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  You know,  when you guys are doing  the lines back and forth  and I get most of the movies,  they're like,  could you just give us  a list of movies  where these are from  so we can play along at home?  Oh, right.  So just list them really fast.  I said it's Goodfellas.  A lot of them  are Goodfellas.  Godfather.  Godfather 2  more than Godfather 1.  That was Godfather.  Both of them.  Clockwork Orange,  The Shining.  Shining is huge.  Cuckoo's Nest,  I love tossing in Cuckoo's Nest.  Full Metal Jacket.  Always.  I'm trying to remember.  We said Goodfellas.  Casino.  Yeah.  Little Casino.  That's the majority of them.  Those are the ones. 
[00:26:00]  I think that was the list  they gave the guy.  We don't stray from our list  very much,  very often.  You don't really have to.  JFK.  Oh, JFK.  Oh, my God, yeah.  You haven't really done  a lot of the JFK.  So what do you think  with this situation?  It looks really bad.  I mean, really bad.  Bob is frustrated with this.  It's hilarious.  And if Bob is frustrated with it,  that means it's gotten  to the point where  it's gotten further  than it should have gotten.  And you know something?  You've got to nip it.  He's got to do something.  But yeah,  he's in a rough situation  because first of all,  he's not a tough guy. 
[00:26:30]  He's a tough negotiator.  Maybe he can negotiate  a deal with the guy.  You don't understand.  10% of his wife.  Something like that.  I could see that  up Bob figuring  something like that out.  Well, Bob,  you don't understand.  It's like you don't need violence.  I mean, you know,  Bob with his pen  could do more than  10,000 men with guns.  You know, I mean,  Bob has a lot of power  as an attorney.  Just hire someone  to kill the guy, Bob.  There you go.  Hire some guy  to just smash his feet  with a bat.  You know something? 
[00:27:00]  He's got to tell his wife.  He has.  I've seen him say it to her.  No, no.  I mean serious.  He's got to say,  look, this stops.  This stops.  I'm going to get you  a new cell phone.  You change the number  and this guy  gets this number again.  And, you know,  there's going to be  a big, big problem.  Big problem.  Hey, John,  what's going on?  Hey, guys.  You got the same problem?  Yeah, well,  you know what it is?  You know,  I've been listening  to you guys  for a long time.  I'm originally  from Long Island.  I used to live  around the corner  from Bob Buckman. 
[00:27:30]  Hey, that's great.  The cue of the day.  Hey, that's great.  Well, you know,  it really sucks  because, you know,  I moved out to PA  and I'm a truck driver  and I'm gone  like every other day.  All right?  And my wife  became friends  with this guy  and every time,  man, you fuck up,  it's like he's  near the comforter.  Right.  You know,  and it blows  and I tried everything  and this guy,  he calls the house  once when I pick up  the phone,  he hangs up the phone,  he's scared of me.  That's creepy.  And it is.  And, you know,  I want to kick  the living shit 
[00:28:00]  out of him,  all right?  And, you know,  he runs scared for me.  And, you know,  it's the same thing.  You know,  so you don't dare  fuck up  because you know  he's just in the aisles  waiting for you.  What would your wife  or what would  someone's girlfriend do  if all of a sudden  every night  you're carrying on  a conversation  with a girl online  and you're, you know,  getting this little relationship  where she's calling you  on the phone,  you're talking,  and then you tell the wife,  oh, you're just friends.  You think any wife  or girlfriend  would stand by  for that crap?  Of course not.  No, no way in hell, man. 
[00:28:30]  They're hanging out  to dry, man.  The first thing  they'll do  is screw you over.  Oh, because you're  just looking to get laid.  But, you know,  I'm just sitting here  and I'm in this  relationship online,  but it's not going  to go any further  than that.  But stop it.  Oh, yeah.  It's always progressing,  moving forward  up to the point  where the guy  wants to take it,  which is sinking it  deep in your loved one.  And let me tell you something.  Women are more capable  of being friends  especially when  they're married with kids  because a lot of times  they don't get out of the house  that much.  They're kind of bored. 
[00:29:00]  So they have fun online  chitting and chatting.  A little chit-chat.  I've talked to a lot  of married women  and to be honest with you,  most of them,  80 to 90% of them  just want to be friendly  and they don't want  to take it anywhere.  Once in a while,  you'll get lucky  and pick one off.  But normally,  they just want to be friendly  and I'm the dirtbag  at home with my pants  and whacking my bag  trying to get  something dirty started.  I see what you mean  but you know something?  It only takes  one guy  to break through  that barrier  and be a little smooth  and it's over.  I'm crass and obvious.  Yeah.  You are crass and obvious. 
[00:29:30]  I try to put LOL  at the end of it  but it doesn't,  you know,  so you want to take  a dump on my chest?  LOL.  You know,  just kidding,  having fun.  R-O-F-L-O.  R-O-A-F.  Roll you all over floor.  I only want to hear that  if you're a burn victim.  All right.  Thank you, John.  Let's go to Lobster.  Another trucker  checking in today.  Hey, Lobster,  what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Here, I'll give you the horn.  There you go.  Listen.  Your horn's a little weak.  Yeah.  Oh, hey, look.  What can I say?  I'll open the window  a little better for you here. 
[00:30:00]  All right.  That's pretty good.  That's a loud one.  Listen,  I was living in New York City  at the time  and I got on a chat room  and I met this chick  down in Delaware.  Her husband was a trucker  and he was gone.  I worked local  and he was gone,  you know,  out all the time  and she started confiding  in me.  Four kids,  the whole nine yards,  married ten years.  Glammin' body.  38 double Ds,  32, 36.  Unbelievable. 
[00:30:30]  Five foot eight,  dark brown hair,  dull eyes,  beautiful.  She runs the show  for her husband.  I mean,  she totally dominates  this guy.  Well,  she's complaining about him.  Well,  let me tell you,  this chick  is into everything  totally freaky.  I mean,  I've introduced her  to fisting,  domination.  Fisting.  How do you introduce  someone to fisting?  How do you introduce  someone to fisting?  Yeah,  what do you do,  put on Caligula  and go,  you know,  pull out the lard? 
[00:31:00]  Oh,  my God.  She is just,  she is a kinky dream  come true.  She's totally into  being dominated.  Tie her up.  She has to be tied up  when I fist her.  She just loves it  because she thrashes.  Well,  they all do,  yes.  Oh,  she thrashes around.  I've even done  double anal fisting  with her.  I mean,  just totally over the top.  Shake hands with yourself.  Wait a minute.  Hey,  pleased to meet you.  Wait,  double anal fisting?  I swear to God,  two fists  in the anal cavity. 
[00:31:30]  Two in the,  and then you know  what you do?  You try to clap.  Hey.  And then you say,  hey,  I can't clap  and she goes,  tight,  huh?  Oh,  I tell you,  hey,  I had a refurbisher.  I put in a 20-pound ham  and pulled out the bone.  Lovely.  Bump,  bump.  Oh,  it's just unbelievable.  So listen,  guys,  I'm warning you,  man,  if you're in that kind  of relationship,  that shit is happening.  All right.  And listen,  I work down,  down in Florida right now.  I drive a cement, 
[00:32:00]  cement bulk hauler.  I got wow written  on all the mudflash.  Oh,  thank you.  I go through  Gainesville,  Florida.  I run dedicated route  between Tampa  and Gainesville.  And that's the  college town,  Florida Gators.  I have had a couple  of those wonderful,  lovely,  perky college  flashes at me.  Very nice.  The girls definitely  are out there,  the girls are definitely  out there ready to  flash if you have wow  in your car.  I'm telling you,  it works like a charm.  Don't the truckers  tend to be chatty  Cathy's?  What else they got? 
[00:32:30]  They're lonely out there.  I understand.  All right,  Lobster,  thank you.  Bye,  fellas.  I can't believe  he put both claws  in her little backside.  Double anal fisting.  Little rubber bands  around his hand.  Old little lobster.  Little rubber band.  I didn't know  that was possible.  Oh,  yeah,  it is.  I hurt.  Fisting to me  is disgusting and violating.  Oh,  we found your limit,  huh?  Does nothing.  I don't like anything  inserted into a woman.  I'm a pervert,  but it's got to be organic. 
[00:33:00]  I don't like dildos  and toys.  Beat it with that crap.  No?  No.  Put this in.  For what?  What is that doing for me?  Exactly.  Yeah,  it's part of your  self-centeredness.  You think it would just  have to be you in there.  But no,  I mean,  no,  not at all.  I know I'm kind of inept,  but it's not about  just using the vagina  as an object holder.  It's not a pencil holder.  I'd rather lick it.  I mean,  it's not about me.  I'm in there.  Believe me,  I'm a good egg,  but I don't like  putting stuff in there  and a fist.  It's so weird  where his lines are, 
[00:33:30]  but it really is.  Okay,  let's say hi to Dale,  another trucker.  A lot of truckers  checking in today.  Of course.  Very early.  Hey.  Hey,  how you doing?  Pretty good,  man.  You had the same issue  as our agent?  Oh,  shit,  yeah.  I mean,  when I woke up,  I just woke up  with the radio station,  and I'm sitting there,  and the next thing  I hear is a story,  and I had a flashback.  This shit happened  to me exactly.  Really?  Let me tell you something.  If he thinks it's going on, 
[00:34:00]  it's going on.  I was married for four months,  and my ex, man,  she was doing a phone deal  and everything.  We went out to New York City.  We're from Indiana.  We went out to New York City  for Christmas last year,  all the way out there  and all the way back.  Her cell phone was ringing,  and guess what?  It was old Bob.  That's who it was.  Huh.  I don't think,  but I'm going to disagree  with one thing.  Just because you think  she's doing it,  she's doing it,  not necessarily true 
[00:34:30]  because his wife  is not cheating on him.  I don't think she's cheating  on him at all.  I have to say that  because we probably  shouldn't even have  brought this story up.  I just know  that it's just  a flirtatious thing  that's driving Bob nuts,  and they're trying  to figure out  how to make this guy  go away.  Close enough,  and there's no upside to it.  It can't end good.  But she's asked him  to don't email me anymore.  Like, please don't email me anymore.  I'm uncomfortable  with your compliments.  You know something?  If she did that,  then fine.  Let him email. 
[00:35:00]  Delete, delete, delete.  Never answer again.  Change your phone number.  Don't answer the cell phone.  Change your phone.  I don't understand.  Hey, mine said  the same thing.  She said that,  well, I asked them  to quit doing this,  and I asked them  to quit doing that,  and then, you know,  something just happened.  Oh, I asked them.  You know, whatever.  And where did this guy  come from?  How did she meet him?  How did mine meet him?  Yeah, how did you?  He was the manager  in the store  where she used to work at. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, there you go.  At the Walmart?  No, at a truck stop.  So that's on my tab.  Oh, boy.  So what happened,  the only thing that's suspicious,  though, is like every time  the guy would call the house,  she would say to Bob,  Bob, could you leave?  Oh.  Like she would ask him  to go into the room  so she could talk.  But that's not fair.  No.  Let's calm down now.  Eric from Nebraska,  what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, man.  When my wife and I  have been married eight years,  and she caught me on AOL  right after we got married,  chatting with some woman, 
[00:36:00]  and she turned around  and started doing  the same damn thing  with some guy.  Well, it was your fault.  You started it.  Good for the goose  is good for the gander.  Oh, yeah,  but she caught me  red-handed doing it.  She tried being sneaky  with me,  and I installed  spyware software  where I could keep an eye  on what she was doing.  Yep.  And so I caught her,  and the conversation  started getting real racy,  like, you know,  the guy wanted to meet her,  and my wife was real sweet  and innocent  and all this shit,  and a friend of mine 
[00:36:30]  told me one day,  he said,  yeah,  there was some strange guy  over at your house  or over at your apartment  when one of my buddies  lived a couple houses down  or a couple doors down from us.  He goes,  yeah,  there was some guy  over there the other day.  That's all.  I don't know  who the fuck he was.  So I turned around  and set up two hidden  video cameras  in our apartment.  I don't know  if I still have the tape,  and I told your screener,  I'll look and see  if I still do,  but man,  my sweet and innocent wife  who told me  she'd never cheat on me.  You got video of her? 
[00:37:00]  What was she doing  in the video?  Oh,  just about anything  that she wouldn't do  with me.  That's for damn sure.  Here he is.  Here's the guy  watching this video.  Yeah,  I just,  you know,  I just...  Turn it off!  Turn it off!  Oh, 
[00:37:30]  oh no,  okay,  no,  that was a tape of me  last night  watching the Yankee game.  Oh,  sorry,  sorry,  I got confused.  Thank you,  Eric.  Yeah.  All right.  You know,  I hate that online thing.  I was online,  I was trying to pick up  what I thought  was a cop once.  Turned out to be  a 13-year-old girl  when I went to meet her.  Isn't that horrible?  I hate when that happens.  So deceiving.  Alabama trucker,  check it in.  It's Colt 4 to 5.  What's up,  buddy?  What's going on,  guys?  Hey.  I'm cruising through  this fuckhole state  of Alabama. 
[00:38:00]  I love these truckers,  man.  Oh,  shit.  Hang in there.  So what do you got today?  It's all foggy  and shitty out.  It's Alabama.  That's a sunny day  in Alabama.  Yeah.  Who are you kidding?  Yeah.  All right,  what do you got,  bro?  Those truck drivers  who called in earlier  fucking another truck driver's  wife while he's out.  Yeah.  They're called Jody's,  man.  Jody's? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah,  that's what we call them  out here,  is a Jody.  A Jody.  A guy,  as soon as you leave  the house,  he's over pumping  cock in your wife  as hard as he can do it.  Wow.  Fucking flying bag.  You know what?  I'm starting to think  that there's not many  truckers out there  in a happy relationship.  I know.  There's all sorts of  crap going on  when they're on the road.  They're getting hemorrhoids  from bouncing all over  the highway.  Their awful wives  are giving a box  to some creep  in the neighborhood.  Don't blame them. 
[00:39:00]  All right,  there's a couple more.  The phones have exploded.  We want to move on  to a couple things here,  but Ryan in Chicago,  hey.  Hey,  how's it going,  guys?  Pretty good,  bro.  Kind of had the same  thing happen to me  a year ago.  My wife kicked me out,  and I'm a trucker,  and I moved in  with my best friend.  He kept going down there  telling me he's just  being friends with her,  found out he's  fucking her in my house  while I was sleeping  on his couch  in his apartment.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, Jesus.  That's low.  Now the two of them  are living together.  The best thing is 
[00:39:30]  I got the house  and everything  out of the whole deal.  Did you beat him up,  though?  Come close a few times.  Every time I go  near their house,  they call the cops  on me for something stupid.  Yeah,  because it's your problem.  Yeah,  I've got the problem,  and he's the lowlife  that snuck in  and banged my old lady  in my bed.  Well,  what did you think,  though,  like when you were  on his couch,  what did he say?  I'll go talk to her  and I'll be back?  How would it happen  that he would just  wind up there  and tell you about it?  No,  he'd tell me  he was going  to somewhere else  to see some other girl.  I went down  to my house one day  and he's sitting 
[00:40:00]  in my kitchen  cooking dinner  for my wife and kids.  I drug him out  of the house  and the lowlife bastard  wouldn't raise his hands.  I threw him  all over the yard  and he wouldn't do nothing.  Just one man  tossing another man  around the yard?  I like that.  Smell your wife  on his penis?  He didn't want  to punch you  because he didn't  want his hands  to swell  because he wanted  to fist your wife.  Oh,  probably.  That's okay.  He can have  the fat skank whore  anyway.  There you go.  That's right.  Move on to another one,  sir.  Thank God 
[00:40:30]  you went with that  with me, sir.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  That was awkward  for all of us.  I wasn't that brave  to go with that  but thank you  for helping me out.  Guys,  opening his heart up  and you're doing  a fisting reference.  I know.  You didn't want  swollen fists?  All right,  two more  and we'll move on.  Okay,  another trucker  in PA.  It's Steve.  Hey, Steve.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Let me hear the horn quick.  There you go.  All right.  Yeah,  I fucked my ex-  I fucked my ex-  old lady  more now than I did  when I was married.  Really?  That's an odd thing, man. 
[00:41:00]  That is an odd thing  when I hear this.  She just got remarried  back in July.  That's the best part.  She's remarried  and you're still banging her?  Oh, yeah.  The new husband  works middle shift  so he ain't never  home at night.  Every time I bring  my son home,  she puts him in bed  and we just go to town.  Wow.  See,  they're all pigs.  People are all  just disgusting  to everybody.  Everyone just wants  to get laid.  We all make believe  we don't want to.  Yes, mister? 
[00:41:30]  Oh!  Bravo!  You got it!  Bravo!  He nailed you!  You ate it!  It's like  you were his ex-wife  the way he just  banged you.  You have to be tired today.  I am tired.  God damn it.  Wow.  That rarely happens  right there.  He got me good.  Oh, boy.  I poked my fat face  right out.  Can I help you?  Hello?  Yes, sir?  Yes, sir?  Wait, he's still there?  Hello?  Richie?  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[00:42:00]  I was at a wedding.  My wife has a lot of clients  and there was this one lawyer guy  who kept calling all the time,  email and everything.  So we're all sitting  at the wedding table  and we're getting  a little drunk.  He says,  you know,  I never want you to think  that there's anything  going on with my wife.  So, you know,  everything's quiet  because people are talking  and shit.  And I said,  if anything was ever  going on with my wife,  I'd just beat  the fucking balls off of you.  The whole wedding  goes dead quiet.  Fucking very uncomfortable situation.  Was anything going on?  I never heard from the guy again.  What was going on 
[00:42:30]  with this guy, though?  Hey, I think he was trying  to strike up something  with my wife,  but then once I confronted  him, he just disappeared.  You're not a lawyer, right?  No, no, no.  I'm a construction worker.  Yeah, definitely.  That's Trump's lawyer,  definitely,  when it comes to the fisticuffs.  For seven cents a day,  you can get Opie and Anthony  or feed this little kid  with the flies on his face.  But you want to laugh,  don't you?  You don't want to be depressed  watching starving children.  So turn them off  and turn on Opie and Anthony.  And we'll send you 
[00:43:00]  a photo of the child  they're helping  in the outfit  of your choice.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Here's Opie and Anthony  when they aren't stinking.  Ooh, who took their shoes off?  It's a little stinky in here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  So what's going on  with Courtney Love?  You brought this story  to our attention, Anthony.  Over the weekend?  Well, she's crazy,  but everyone knows that.  She went into rehab, finally.  There were a lot of people speculating. 
[00:43:30]  She was on the drugs,  drinking, whatever it is.  But she went into rehab.  Letting homeless guys  suck on her boobies.  Yeah, remember that shot?  That shot's pretty hilarious.  Oh, God.  That's a funny photo.  The press is there,  a huge crowd,  and she lets some homeless guy  suck on her tit  right there in front of people.  She's always been in trouble  with the law forever.  She doesn't show up  for court dates.  She was supposed to be 
[00:44:00]  at court one day  and they dragged her out of a...  The ambulance came  and EMS had to drag her out  screaming out of an apartment.  She's just been a mess for years.  And she's been a spectacle,  pretty much.  And now,  turns out,  she wants to fix herself up.  So she went to rehab.  And as page six reported,  Neil Young gets credit  for helping Courtney Love  kick her drug habit.  Can you turn off, old man? 
[00:44:30]  That was the worst cue  in radio history.  That was really bad.  Ben, that was the worst cue  in radio history.  Are you insane?  Oh, jeez.  I got a little excited.  Halfway through the story,  was that an actual cue  or did Derek see  one of your herks  and thought there was a cue?  Was a herk or a jerk  looked like a cue?  When was Ben supposed to cue it?  We're going to read the story  and then...  You tell us when.  I don't know when.  Exactly.  You have no idea.  We're going to read the story.  You know,  she thinks Neil Young helped her 
[00:45:00]  because she was listening  to old man from decades  and then we were going to  maybe play the song  and everyone could...  So he can't get it too short.  Yeah, and everyone  could maybe listen  to a really nice  Neil Young song  and reflect.  The second Neil Young's  name came out.  Whoa!  Quick!  Hit the button!  Okay, I think I know.  All right, I'm sorry.  Go to the story.  Neil Young gets credit for it.  Old man!  Take a look at it.  Old man,  wrap some tape on my wife. 
[00:45:30]  We're trying to get away from that.  Oh, sorry.  I'm doing my best here.  All right, Anthony,  why don't you read the story  about Courtney Love  trying to kick drugs  as she listens to  Neil Young in rehab.  Well, Neil Young  gets credit for...  No, not now.  Stop!  Go ahead, Anthony.  I'm sorry.  Obi, Neil Young  gets credit for helping  Courtney Love  kick her drug habit.  All right.  She's quoted as saying,  when I was in rehab, 
[00:46:00]  I had some really cool CDs  with me.  Mm-hmm.  The Rock Widow  told Steppin' Out Magazine,  quote again,  I had Dylan,  I had R.E.M.,  and I had Neil Young's  Decades.  Oh!  I put on Decades  and heard Old Man.  Not yet.  Turn it off.  Got it.  Old man.  I had Neil Young's Decades.  I put on Decades  and heard Old Man.  Not yet.  This is stupid funny, 
[00:46:30]  by the way.  It is funny.  I put on Decades  and heard Old Man.  All right.  It was five in the morning  and I was kicking Xanax  and it was a fucking nightmare  and I saw Neil...  No!  And I saw Neil standing above me  and I was like...  And she's quoted as saying,  Neil, you're God. 
[00:47:00]  This is great.  And that was huge, I thought.  I can do this.  I can get through this  and Neil is going to...  All right.  We get it.  ...get me through.  We get the joke.  It was a deeply spiritual thing.  It was cool.  Love, uh...  Acknowledges.  Acknowledges.  She became pathetic.  People have been watching  the spectacle of me  for free for years.  I'm sort of sick  of letting them exploit me. 
[00:47:30]  These are things  that are passing.  I was really fucked up.  I started doing coke,  which was just stupid.  I can't even tell you  how embarrassing it is.  Carrie Fisher...  We don't have a Carrie Fisher song.  I'm sorry.  I thought Old Man  would have been good.  Carrie Fisher came over  to my house  and yelled in my room,  I can't believe you're taking  the most embarrassing drug  in the world.  I was in there dying of shame.  That stuff just makes you  come to a bad end.  Cocaine's the most embarrassing  drug in the world?  I think you're right. 
[00:48:00]  I think she's right.  It is a really embarrassing drug.  I don't know.  It's so dated.  I think roofies  are kind of embarrassing.  Well...  You know,  if you're taking Midol  and it's ruining your life,  you're an ass.  But cocaine's so 80s.  It's like dated drug.  It's got this stigma to it  that you're just, you know,  an old corporate 80s guy.  You're still doing blow.  Yeah, heroin's a lot cooler.  Chic.  Chic.  Heroin chic.  Much chic-er.  But the thought  that she got this image 
[00:48:30]  of Neil Young over her  and said she actually thought  Neil Young is God  came to her  and got her through  her rehab.  We'll see how much this works  when she gets out.  Good luck to you.  Well, you want to listen  to Neil Young  and kind of just reflect  a little bit, Anthony?  Let me listen.  All right.  It's Neil Young.  Old man.  Oh.  I wonder if Tom Cruise  likes this song.  We'll ask him when he, uh... 
[00:49:00]  Calls the show  and we'll, uh...  It turns up a little bit.  Give us a little more volume.  Stop laughing at me.  Stop laughing at me.  Stop laughing at me.  And I'm sorry.  Stella.  Oh, man.  Exclusive audio  of Courtney Love.  Stella.  Why did you do that? 
[00:49:30]  Why did you admit  everyone loving me?  Oh, man.  Look at my life.  You're stupid.  Twenty-four and there's  so much more.  Live alone in a paradise  that makes me think of doom.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Shut up.  You shut up.  You shut up.  You shut up.  You shut up.  Shut up. 
[00:50:00]  Shut the fuck up.  You shut up.  Shut up.  Oh, man.  Take a look at my life.  I'm a lot like you.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here. 
[00:50:30]  Don't love me.  The medications don't work.  Don't love me.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  Don't love me.  Nothing works here.  Uh-huh.  The medications don't work.  What medication does that?  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  Nothing works here.  Hey, Brian.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I hate this place. 
[00:51:00]  I've been here for seven years.  Nothing works here.  You've only been here since yesterday.  The medications don't work.  I hate this place.  And then we'll need you to do medication, okay?  Shut up.  Let it hold.  I'm a man in your structure.  Nothing works here.  Shut up.  I hate this place.  Okay?  Nothing works here.  Oh, man, take a look at my life from my life.  At Sam to Hotel, the OBN Anthony Show.  Okay, and then might as well play Jimmy's audio. 
[00:51:30]  You were very excited about this today.  I think I'm going to be as good as an ensemble.  Do you want to?  Couldn't you have had something a little less really good before this?  Yeah.  This is just something I threw in.  I figured I was all proud of myself.  I did a little show prep.  Yes, you did.  And you taped something and everything.  Oh, I burned it on a DVD.  I even marked off what it was.  All by yourself?  Yep, closed off the DVD.  Very nice.  I thought you had company.  I did.  First things first.  You were doing this?  The show comes first?  Without OBN Anthony, I don't have that company.  You think I don't know that? 
[00:52:00]  Was she smiling, braces sparkling over your shoulder while you were doing it?  Was she or was she just laying there tired and irritated with me?  Might I say she's been fine company, though?  She's really fun to hang out.  Yeah.  I want to just really bludgeon people after 40 minutes, but she's been great.  Did she make one of those little paper things that you work with your fingers?  I-L-O-V-E-Y-O-U.  Okay, number six.  Open it up.  Tell your fortune.  No?  No. 
[00:52:30]  Did you play Chutes and Ladders?  Yeah, with Jimmy, it's Poop Chutes and Ladders.  Poops and Logs and Ladders.  Well, what's the deal with this audio?  Acting Governor, what's his name?  Cody of New Jersey.  His wife's name is Mary Jo Cody.  I do not remember.  I just kind of tuned it in as the broadcast was starting, and I hit TiVo quick.  Took over for old Governor shit dick over there in McGreevy in Jersey.  And she's apparently manic depressive.  And just to hear this stuff about the acting governor's wife, I just giggled all the way through it, and I probably shouldn't have. 
[00:53:00]  Was he the lieutenant governor or something?  I don't know how Jersey works, but he wasn't elected to this party.  No, no, no.  Neither was McGreevy.  When McGreevy...  No, McGreevy...  Wait a minute.  No, he wasn't.  He took over for Christy Whitman when she went to...  To the EPA.  Right.  So this is all the shit that comes out, all the skeletons that pour out when the media doesn't just dig into your life before you get elected to something.  So McGreevy liked to suck an occasional cock, and this guy apparently has an albatross around his neck and his wife. 
[00:53:30]  I don't know what his political aspirations are, but he could just make the little bye-bye sign that David Bowie makes in that stupid modern love video, because it's gone, stupid.  That's it.  If this guy tried...  Because she could theoretically be the first lady.  You can go from governor to one more term in governor.  You run for president.  Sure.  It's not uncommon.  Clinton was governor.  Bush was governor. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  So it's a huge post to be the governor of the state.  And his wife is...  And she's cuckoo.  She's...  This bitch is nuts.  She's nuts.  So it's the governor's wife of Jersey, Mary Jo Cody, and she's just...  Talking about her...  She's just nuts.  ...doubted with depression for many years.  Yeah, and she had some horrible thoughts.  That first one I heard.  Are you replaying that one?  I sort of heard it, because then I was too busy watching the TV to see if it was happening.  And the governor is sitting by her.  The governor of a state.  Watching his political career go down the toilet. 
[00:54:30]  Down the tubes.  Because this woman's insane.  Shut your wife up.  All right, here's the first clip again.  I felt like I was some kind of monster.  I had a scary thought about putting the baby in the microwave, and I'm done.  Put the baby in the microwave.  Yeah, that'll get you elected.  That's the governor's wife.  Oh, my God.  Governor of Jersey.  Holy crap.  Check, please.  Oh, man.  Will the Jersey governor's wife put the baby in the microwave? 
[00:55:00]  Wow.  Unbelievable.  You shouldn't say everything that you think.  Yeah.  You know.  Get some of those demons in your head.  There's a way to open up and say, I've beaten this affliction, without saying, I wanted to  put the little tot in the microwave.  Baby in the microwave.  There's nothing worse you could do to a baby.  Oh.  Well, check that guy's name off the list.  Well, there may be other things you could do.  For future presidents.  There may be things you could do to a baby.  I don't know.  Maybe the next clip will tell.  Oh, you're kidding.  There's more?  No, I don't know. 
[00:55:30]  And I had the baby down below me in the water, and I thought I could drown him in a minute.  And I thought to myself, I've had it again.  I'm done.  And I decided the hospital didn't work for me.  I'm going to commit suicide.  Leave the baby alone.  The baby in the bathtub or something?  Yeah, he kind of cut what she was.  He should have left a little bit more of the clip in there, because she was talking about  bathing the baby.  Bathing the baby.  And she had a thought about how she could just hold it underwater and drown it.  That's great.  Look, I could just hold this.  You know, I think everyone has these evil thoughts at some time. 
[00:56:00]  They come in your head where you see somebody and you go, boy, if I push them, they'd fall  right in front of that subway right there.  Absolutely.  You know, someone leaning out over the platform like an idiot.  And you look and go, I could just reach over and push them right there.  But you don't, first of all, you don't do it.  You don't ever think you're going to do it.  And you certainly don't talk about doing it next to your governor husband.  Put the baby in the microwave and then drown the little fella.  Oh, or you could drown him and then dry him off in the microwave. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Leave the baby alone.  Kill yourself.  Well, she talked about that.  And she said, drowned him.  I could drown him.  Drowned.  You stupid.  What?  That is such a white trash way to say it.  I could drown him.  Rich?  They're only words.  They're only words.  Thank you, Rich Bloss.  Oh, like two spelled T-O.  Who'd do that?  That's a weird one sometimes.  Maybe your next album should be no such thing as silent L's.  I can't believe it. 
[00:57:00]  All right.  Well, is that it?  I guess.  I don't know.  Whatever Steve put on there.  Let's see if there's another clip here.  I just told my psychiatrist, I called him up and I said, I just, I'm not making it.  I can't face the day.  So she upped my, she upped my antidepressants too much.  And I had seizures.  And then I went into a coma.  This woman is a prize.  What a disaster she is.  Oh, there's more.  Is she hot?  Wow.  Yeah, she's a mediocre.  I'd rather have Mrs. McGreevy's homosexual turning vagina in bed next to you than Mrs. 
[00:57:30]  Kook.  Yeah, this guy's getting a good night's sleep, right?  And you know he's thinking about McGreevy going, I see your point.  You lean over, you toot on it, you talk about the game, no one gets hurt.  How the hell?  Go ahead.  I see all your fag friend wants to do is maybe put a little molding up.  He doesn't want to drown your infant.  Drown your kid.  How the hell is this guy governing the state?  He has to sleep with one eye open. 
[00:58:00]  Unbelievable.  With the little walkie-talkie hooked up in the baby's room to make sure she's not in there flambanging.  Really, baby monitor on all the time.  Psychotic whore.  He's trying to make decisions, fiscal decisions.  Right, and her medication's under lock and key.  I don't know what fiscal decisions are, by the way.  Fiscal.  We went with it, though.  You got your baby monitor hooked up to a Bluetooth so you can just hear it wherever you are at all times.  Talk back to it.  Honey, no!  Oh, God.  Don't put the baby in the microwave.  There might be some more audio.  Let's try one more.  All right.  Adversity, no stranger here. 
[00:58:30]  Just three months later, breast cancer.  An interim medication for her depression and now a visit to her cancer doctor.  I said, I hope I die on the table.  I seriously hope that I die on the table.  And my sister started to cry.  But I just can't go on when I get like that.  I just, I can't.  I mean, breast cancer didn't faze me.  Because I was already down so low that when someone told me I had breast cancer, there was no more steps to go down. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, man.  Can I say for the record, the only thing worse than a woman putting your child in the microwave is if you can't titty fuck her after.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  This is the same guy that can't understand why they're not going to take us off the premium channel anytime soon.  Are you insane?  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, XM wants to promote this.  They're so proud of this.  Yeah, I've got to keep plugging Bob Edwards.  Who cares?  Oh, my God.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Wow.  I want to congratulate Governor Peterson and his wife.  No.  Yeah.  Thanks on the instant feedback for that suggestion.  Remove baby from pouch.  Microwave on high for three seconds.  Yeah, I did say that.  I'll take a bullet here.  Governor-ing.  Oh, yeah, Governor-ing.  We did let that slide.  Yeah, we did.  But we can't stop every time someone messes up. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, yes, we can.  Please, John.  Yes.  John.  What's up, Joe?  Yeah, go ahead.  And I tried to say it three times.  Yeah, governing, governing, governing.  I'm like, something's not making sense here.  Governing.  Well, you know, when Voss is here, it rubs off on all of us.  Bush is doing a good job presidenting.  Presidenting.  All right, all right.  Governor-ning.  Governor-ning.  Ridiculous.  I really couldn't figure it out in my head today.  Governing.  Governor-ning.  Governing. 
[01:00:30]  I have a really, really, really horrible headache today, too, so.  All right, John.  Thank you for noticing.  Holla back, guys.  All right.  Holla.  Do you realize who he was hired?  He's a disruptive influence.  Anthony.  He happens to be a dwarf.  What a horrible table.  Our new bosses said you guys should get as crazy as you want.  They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity.  Opie and Anthony show.  It's psychotic.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they don't suck. 
[01:01:00]  Good for what ails you.  What, what?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Dude, at the last job, god damn it, now we're going to waste ten more minutes.  What's the matter, Opie?  At our last job.  Oh, when we first got there.  When no one really knew who we were.  We were still doing the stupid radio crap.  I remember this.  We finally put an end to that when we got some kind of audience behind us.  But they actually came to Anthony and I and said, hey, we got a great idea for a promotion.  We want to give away a chance.  Ben's in here because it was, he'll laugh at this too. 
[01:01:30]  We want to give a chance for a listener to watch the Super Bowl with Opie and Anthony.  That was the big prize.  That was Roger, our promotions guy who knew nothing, putting that one together.  We'll have you guys show up at the house with a big screen television set.  And you can sit there with the guy and his family and watch the Super Bowl. 
[01:02:00]  What?  We have to sit in a house with people we don't know.  Instead of hanging out with our own, you know, family and friends.  And we'd only been doing the show for like, I don't know, it wasn't very long.  It was a few months.  And, you know, the guy that entered the contest knows the show.  But everyone else, his whole family and everything, couldn't have a clue who we were.  We don't care less.  Imagine just knocking on someone's door during the Super Bowl and saying, hey, mind if I hang out with you?  And then sitting there, you don't know anybody and they don't know you.  And you're sitting there, we're supposed to watch the Super Bowl. 
[01:02:30]  I felt like I knew everyone there, though.  You had the guy with his young, hot girlfriend.  Oh, it was everyone you see everywhere else.  At every other party.  Right.  You just didn't know these people.  They just looked a little different and their names were different.  You had the aunt that thinks she's a little wild.  She's crazy.  She gets a few in her and oh, oh, oh, she's crazy.  Get out of her way.  She thinks she's funnier than she really is.  Oh, yeah.  She's wild.  And if the situation was right, you'd be banging her, you know.  Oh, she'll put the elbow in your ribs.  A plantation is happening.  And then you got the other lady that's proud of her stupid dish that she brought to the Super Bowl party. 
[01:03:00]  I was slaving over the stove all morning to make these sweetest meatballs.  Oh, look, Marge brought her lasagna.  Marge brought her.  You got to taste this because it's just fantastic.  No, I don't have to taste this.  It tastes like placenta with a meatball in it.  So Anthony and I have to show up at this house somewhere on Long Island.  Hey, we're here for the Super Bowl.  Here's your grand prize.  Here's your big screen television, which, you know, is a cool prize and all.  Oh, lucky you.  You get to hang out with Ant and I for the Super Bowl. 
[01:03:30]  We sat on the couch.  We didn't even, Ant and I didn't even talk to each other.  He sat on one side of the couch.  I drank all their beer.  They were so excited.  They set up, like, video cameras and just, like, had them in the corner to videotape the whole time we were there.  God, that sucked.  I wish someone out there was at that party and could get those tapes.  Yeah, wouldn't that be great?  Someone out there, I'm sure, knows that you guys went on to become huge, thank you, huge stars.  I'm sure there's a videotape of us sitting there, bored shitless.  It was the worst, man. 
[01:04:00]  We had to show up.  We even had to bring the beer and soda.  Remember, we're hauling it in.  Oh, it was a big presentation where we're supposed to, like, go, hey, we're here with the beer and the TV.  Yeah, usually when you do a radio promotion, you get, like, a support staff that comes with you and sets up everything.  I know Ben because it was Ben's job at the time.  And, no, there was no support staff.  They just give us the address and go, show up before the game starts.  And we're like, oh, and by the way, can you bring the soda and the beer?  Yeah.  It was awful, absolutely awful.  This is a great promotion.  And his brilliant idea was the morning show at the time, Mason and Kalinsky. 
[01:04:30]  Roger set it up.  Earl and I had to go way out to Jersey and then meet you guys in Long Island.  By the time we got there, the game was over.  It was retarded planning.  And Roger, one of Roger's brilliant, brilliant promotions.  And then he ended up stealing everything from the station.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Him and Eddie.  Yeah.  You know, the only reason he had the job was because his father-in-law was a bigwig in the company.  Yeah.  So he had to take care of this, like, useless person.  He was Mel's best friend.  Yeah, sure.  So you guys are pretty much saying that before I kind of came along, you guys had to do a lot of shit work. 
[01:05:00]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Not really, pal.  Let's relax.  Let's calm down a little bit.  I'm saying you had to go out and do that.  That's, that's, you kind of paved the way and saved me the trouble.  We didn't, uh, I guess in a way.  Update on the Oompa Loompa shirt that's available on eBay.  The autographed Oompa Loompa shirt is now up to $187.50.  Is this a real bid?  It seems to be.  It's kind of hard to do fake bids, right? 
[01:05:30]  It can, but it kind of screws up your...  You can welch on an eBay auction.  Yeah.  That's unfortunate, but yeah, it's possible.  But it kind of screws up your...  It's up to 201 right now.  It's up to 201.  The intern is jumping up and down.  You are a smart kid, Danny.  Yeah, this kid knows what he's doing.  203.51.  203.  All right.  Um, we have to go to the phones and talk about, uh, yeah, remember this one, Anthony?  Brian from Syracuse.  Yes, Brian.  Yeah, I just wanted to know if you guys served, uh, a giant Pop-Tart to eat instead of popcorn and wings and shit.  Oh, this son of a bitch that would do...  Anthony and I came from Boston where we were like, um, we were huge. 
[01:06:00]  I mean, we were doing well.  No, we were really big in the Boston radio market.  And then, uh, we got, you know, we told the, we told, uh, all of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery car accident on April Fool's.  And we got fired, okay?  So then we have to, like, we, we, we eat it so many times in our career, it's not even funny.  Once again, we're in the underdog position, and, and we're in the fight of our lives again.  But we came to New York...  Gunfire wailing over my head.  We came, we came to New York and, uh, yeah, we had to start over. 
[01:06:30]  No one cared.  You know, we were huge in Boston, but for New York, it's like, whatever, dudes.  We don't know who you are down here.  So we had to, like, you know, build it up again like we're doing here with the XM Satellite.  And they, uh, they hired this promotion guy, like, don't worry, man, don't worry.  This guy, if, you know, whatever you need, he'll, he'll get within a day.  Yeah.  You need a Humvee.  I remember them saying, if you need two Humvees, he'll have them there the next day.  He'll fucking get them right for you.  Right.  Yeah.  So, yeah, he's, he's giving us this, uh, big pitch in his office, like, look, man, I'm your guy. 
[01:07:00]  I'm going to make you guys big again.  I'll give you the promotional staff you need to, you know, to get known here in New York.  He was awful.  And then he would come to us every other day with these stupid radio promotion ideas that Anthony and I just don't do.  You know, the show is about hanging out and stuff.  Let's be honest.  Yeah.  We're guilty as charged, as they would say.  But, but there are so many other ideas.  Like, are you insane?  Yeah.  You know what the show is about and hanging out and having a good time and realism and stuff like that.  Not anti-radio bits. 
[01:07:30]  You know what I mean?  And, uh, he comes to and approaches us one day and goes, and he was happy and skipping into the, uh, into the studio to tell us this because he thought we would just think it was the greatest thing ever.  He says, uh, guys, guess what?  I got a remote for you.  I mean, like a remote.  All right?  You go out of the studio and set up camp somewhere.  Usually remotes that we've done are pretty cool.  Uh, we've done some from, uh, concerts and stuff backstage. 
[01:08:00]  Uh, so they're pretty cool, you know, depending on where they are.  So we thought he had a remote for us.  Like OzFest, we went to that.  We had a great time.  Uh, guys, I have a remote for you.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, where, Roger?  Where?  Well, in Madison Square Garden.  I'm thinking Madison Square Garden.  Okay, this is cool.  Okay.  You know, the garden.  They put on some good shows there.  I'm with you so far.  Madison Square Garden is hosting the world's largest Pop-Tart.  And I got you guys where you can set up right next to it. 
[01:08:30]  And broadcast live.  And broadcast live from the world's largest Pop-Tart at Madison Square Garden.  We looked at it.  I started laughing because I thought it had to be a joke.  And I was waiting for the punchline and everything.  No, no.  So he actually was setting us up where we would have our broadcast next to a giant toaster pastry.  What the?  What are we going to?  How he thought this would enhance our program. 
[01:09:00]  Although, I must say, we have been talking about it for quite a while now.  Can you imagine the radio show, though?  Oh.  You know, give us something to work with here.  Hey, we're here in front of the largest Pop-Tart.  And, uh, wow, it's pretty large, Anthony.  Opie, I cannot wait until two hours.  We're counting down.  We're going to cut into this thing and see if it is apple or blueberry.  That's right.  We don't know yet.  We'll be taking your call so you can guess.  And whoever guesses correctly what the toaster pastry filling is.  And after this break, we'll be talking to the chef. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, the guy that actually cooked the giant Pop-Tart.  That's right.  It's an exclusive interview with the chef, Anthony.  Maybe he'll give us the ingredients to the frosting that goes on top of it.  Boy, we can only hope.  Hey, where are they going to get a toaster to put this thing in?  And for all you listeners stuck in traffic because you're trying to get down to the world's largest Pop-Tart, don't you worry.  It's going to be here a while, and so will we.  It'll be here a while, and we'll be cutting little pieces off for everybody so you'll be able to try the world's largest Pop-Tart. 
[01:10:00]  This thing is huge, Opie.  Just look at the size of it.  I think that's what he was expecting, that we would be happy.  When he walked into the studio with this, he was expecting us to be like, wow,  and just pat him on the back and shake his hand and go, job well done.  Giant Pop-Tart, great job.  And then he came up with the wow window clangs.  We sat down with him and our retarded program director, Gary.  The ice cream man. 
[01:10:30]  The ice cream PD who would come in licking an ice cream cone  as we're pulling our hair out of our head because of multiple problems.  And he would just come skipping in.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Go away.  Die.  And Roger.  I liked our program director, Gary, though.  He taught me all about the stock market.  Yeah, well, that's about all he did.  He was heavy up in the stock market like everyone was back then.  But, Roger, we sit down and design out these wow stickers  because we want to get them out as quickly as possible.  We meticulously pick a background color and a font color 
[01:11:00]  so it best shows up at distances and, you know, visibility.  Painstaking.  It took weeks to design these stickers.  We send them out.  We get the boxes back, much like the scene out of Spinal Tap  when they received Smell the Glove.  Yeah, exactly.  We open up these boxes expecting to see the sticker we designed  that took weeks, weeks, maybe even months to design.  And Roger peels one out.  And what he's got is equivalent to a wow color form. 
[01:11:30]  It's a clear color form.  I remember saying to myself, oh, we're fucked.  Yeah.  And we're like, wait, where are the wow stickers?  He goes, no, better than stickers.  These are window clings.  We're like, what the fuck?  What the fuck?  What?  What?  We designed it.  No.  These people don't have to worry about messing up their bumpers  with bumper stickers.  You could put these right on your window.  Yeah.  But what about, like, the people that were, I was going to say,  and it's not like tinted windows were popular. 
[01:12:00]  Tinted windows.  In the late 90s.  The backs of tractor trailers.  Right.  Signposts.  Right.  Walls.  Anywhere else you see wow stickers around, which is everywhere,  that you will not see them because it's on a window cling.  Unbelievable.  Boxes upon boxes.  Boxes upon boxes of these useless window clings.  That, by the way, matched nothing in font or color to the sticker  that we came up with.  Yeah.  But he was a genius.  He knew better.  I could see him at the sticker place having our design, 
[01:12:30]  everything we wanted, going up to the counter at the sticker place  and going, here's what I want.  And then looking up and seeing a window cling and going,  hmm, I have a better idea.  I'm going to get window clings.  And taking the initiative, you know, all by himself,  making the decision.  What about the time he wanted us to marry a couple on Valentine's Day  in a limo?  In a limo.  So Anthony and I would broadcast live from a limo.  Right.  As a couple was getting married in the limo on their way down to Atlantic City, 
[01:13:00]  I think, where the honeymoon would be.  Very good.  You remember this.  And we would broadcast the whole thing.  What we want you to do is pick a couple to win,  a couple that's going to be married.  They could call in, and we will pick a winner,  and the winner gets to get married in the limo  with you two presiding over the wedding.  And you could broadcast it live from inside the limo.  Oh, you worthless piece of crap.  And then people wonder why we get stupid and do all these crazy things to get attention. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And they wonder why we do the voyeur bus, and we did, you know, the...  The C word on TV.  And 55 gallon drum challenge, and all the fun stuff that people want to hear.  Because the station itself was presenting us through people like Roger  with this crap drivel that you wouldn't hear on a morning zoo show.  A Pop-Tart indeed.  Yes, Ben.  He then also, we were giving away satellite dishes,  and he set it up so he won one as well as our program director. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, that was another scandal.  That was another scandal.  And then when we knew that the radio station was completely falling apart,  all this legendary rock memorabilia that was hanging on the walls.  Oh, gold records from the Beatles.  Led Zeppelin lithographs that were signed by everybody, including Bonham, before he died.  Back the car up to any double game.  We don't know for sure, but it seems like...  Allegedly.  Yeah, it seems like he took a lot of that stuff. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Stuff signed by Kurt Cobain just hanging up on the walls.  I could use this.  Everything just disappeared.  The best was, allegedly, there was a huge box of stuff.  He came in one morning on one of his last days, and we had Eddie, who was handicapped.  We had Eddie.  Handy-capable.  Yes.  He was handy-capable.  Who also distributed our mail, which was a whole other...  They had the retarded guy distribute the mail at N.E.W.  But he had Eddie take everything down to his car.  He had this huge box.  And sure enough, no one ever knew what happened to the gold records. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, we used to get mail.  Like, I'd get Ben's mail.  Opie's mail would have, like, Earl's and the radio chick's mail.  And then he would come into our office, the mail guy, Eddie, and go, what's his name?  What's his name here say?  And point to the envelope.  He couldn't read the names on the envelope, but they gave him the job of delivering the mail.  You can't make this stuff up.  No.  Yeah, they had a guy.  I mean, you know, he was very cool, but he was a little slow.  I can't.  What's the mail?  What's the address on this?  What's his name?  Is this Opie? 
[01:15:30]  And so they gave him, you know, a little more responsibility.  His job was to just take care of the garbage.  He was a huge Mets fan.  I still see him.  He's, you know, I don't want to trash the guy.  M-O-N.  That spells Muni.  But they're like, yeah, I think we want him delivering the mail.  It was just like every day.  So he'd deliver the mail.  It was an adventure.  And take out the garbage.  That was his job.  And sometimes the mail ended up in the garbage.  Well, there was a sales guy who was, like, going through a divorce who had all his bills  coming through the station.  Was that the gay sales guy that we saw his pictures online? 
[01:16:00]  I was in that boat, too.  At one point, I was in that same boat.  Going through the divorce, I didn't have an address, so I was getting some of my mail,  like cell phone bills and stuff, sent to the station.  I had my cell phone turned off because I don't know where it ended up.  I don't know.  Whose name is this?  I put it in the caramelo box.  It gets even better.  When we switch formats, we get all these new mic flags.  Nobody could find the mic flags.  And he put them in a closet.  10-10 wins. 
[01:16:30]  They were missing for months.  Yeah, it was in a back, like an air conditioning unit closet, up in 10-10 wins, the news station.  That's where all the new mic flags were.  It was just a mess.  He would put stuff somewhere.  You'd be expecting something.  Like, oh, this person's supposed to send something to the show.  And you'd be like, where is it?  And then weeks later, you'd find it somewhere behind a desk or in a closet.  I don't know what name he had.  It gets even better.  We were giving away TVs one time.  All right.  And he was in charge of bringing the, I'm sorry, I'm laughing, sorry. 
[01:17:00]  He was in charge of bringing the TVs up.  And he got on the freight elevator.  And the guy's in the freight elevator.  He's like, I don't care.  Just take one.  We lost, like, three TVs.  Yeah, they were like, hey, what do you got there?  Oh, they're TVs.  They come in for the station.  And the guy's, of course, trying to take advantage of them.  They're like, how many you got there?  Hey, can I grab one?  Oh, yeah, take one.  You take a TV.  He probably thought they were going to help him bring the TVs upstairs or something.  I'm just amazed we made anything of ourselves. 
[01:17:30]  Me to say, you take a TV.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, God, shut up.  I'm just amazed.  We had no help over there.  None whatsoever.  And then in that little bathroom, here's a great Muni story, great Scott Muni story.  There was that disgusting bathroom by the studio.  Someone had thrown paper towels into the toilet.  So Muni comes out, and he's like, goddamn, motherfucker.  You know, who did this?  And he goes, it's okay, Scott.  I'll take care of it.  Puts his bare hand into that disgusting toilet.  Oh, yeah, he wouldn't care.  Muni's like, Jesus Christ. 
[01:18:00]  He just walked away.  It was hilarious.  It was just an adventure over there.  The freak show over there.  It really was an adventure.  Coming up next on Opie and Anthony's Jim Norton's thing.  Forget me not.  You sightless taut.  You dog just shit on my rug.  I thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you?  How's that for a sketch?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You don't do sketches, stupid.  Say, Jim, what nice feels.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  This is some sexual reference.  Let's bring in Tommy Chong, man. 
[01:18:30]  Sure.  From Cheech and Chong.  Spent some time in jail, I think.  Yes.  You think.  I think.  There he is.  Of course we know.  Legend.  He's a legend.  Hey, guys.  Hey, what's up, Tommy?  What's up, man?  That was the most intense sit-down of a celebrity in our history of broadcasting.  I think, man.  Looked like you were going to kill us.  What?  No, you were just getting settled, and it was very, uh...  Oh, I'm taking my time, you mean? 
[01:19:00]  It's okay that you took your time.  You just had a way about it.  It was good.  I'm an old guy.  Not really.  You're not that old.  I'm a made comic.  Yeah?  Made comic.  Made comic.  I made my bones while you were doing open mics.  That's right.  That's right.  We belong to a secret society.  Yeah.  So, how's everything?  Who's Opie?  Um, me?  The one that looks kind of like a...  Opie?  Or, like, kind of...  I thought...  For some reason, I thought it was for opium or something. 
[01:19:30]  Or the opium and Anthony show.  Hey, well, that's not a bad idea.  Opium and...  Some days...  Some days, people do call up and go, the opium and...  Do you want opium?  Yeah, and then, uh...  Anthony, and of course...  Anthony would be an Italian-looking guy.  Yeah, and then Jimmy Norton over there.  So, you're in town.  We were just talking before the show.  Of course, I went out and said hello to Tommy, doing the marijuana logs in the village.  Yeah.  Yeah, what's that about?  It's the only job I could get after I got out of jail.  The only job I was offered.  Are you kidding? 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Well...  A lot of people were pissed off that you went to jail?  Why?  Why did I get...  No, I...  Why did I go to jail, or why are they pissed off?  Well, we...  You're like, why wouldn't they give you a job?  Going to jail for...  Everyone knows you went to jail for something stupid.  Well, Disneyland and things like that.  You know, I was supposed to do a voiceover gig at Disney for one of their movies.  And now Disney won't touch it because...  Oh, they just...  Oh, that's such crap.  They just...  I got a call from Goofy, you know.  You're probably...  Uh, nope. 
[01:20:30]  You're not on.  I'm sure you're probably, you know, tired of the story, but fill the listeners in.  What happened, like...  What happened...  Uh, what happened was, uh, my son had a company that sold, uh, water bongs, you know, water  pipes that had my face on it.  And I used to help him, uh, promote them, you know.  When I would go around the country, uh, doing private, or private comedy clubs.  Mm-hmm.  You know, my wife and I have a show, and, you know, Chong, and the family's stoned, and 
[01:21:00]  we'd go out and have a good time.  And we would sell the, uh, the pipes at the shows.  And autograph them and stuff, right?  Yeah, autograph them and stuff.  Yeah, why not?  Yeah.  And then we had an art show in L.A., and, and it was, you know, art, uh, like in a gallery  and that, you know, so a lot of collectors bought them.  And, um, but the, um, DEA was on my tail.  I didn't know about it, but...  The DEA.  Yeah.  Because of bongs.  Because of water pipes, yeah.  Unbelievable. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, they followed...  Weren't they showing up and, like, taking pictures of you and stuff like that?  Yeah, they followed me around.  They followed, you know, we, like, in Arlington, Arlington, Texas, they followed me there in  the, the undercover operation.  And it was really weird, because you, there were obviously cops.  Uh, you know, I've seen them, and I said, uh, you know, but, you know, in my mind, I  wasn't doing anything illegal.  You know, if I was, uh, you know, how come...  I thought you were allowed to sell the, uh...  Yeah.  ...the water bongs and all that.  At the time.  At the time, we were.  And, but these guys, you know, they had the undercover thing. 
[01:22:00]  They had the undercover things and acted like hippies, you know, you know, that, that look,  you know, like linebackers with headbands.  You could spot them, right, Tommy?  Tommy's like, that's a narc.  That's like, uh, it's... </pre>
