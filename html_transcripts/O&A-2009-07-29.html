<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts dismissing listener count surveys using vulgar language.  This transitioned into an "Anthony Appreciation Day/Hour" with guest Bob Kelly, whose new white scooter became the target of Opie's relentless mockery, leading to a broader discussion of Opie's negative experiences with motorized two-wheelers, including a childhood minibike accident.  The show then moved onto a segment dedicated to bad tattoos, featuring numerous caller anecdotes detailing misspellings, poor artistry, and questionable subject matter.  Guests scheduled for later in the show were mentioned: Bob Kelly, Brooke Hogan (to discuss her parents' divorce), and Michael Emerson (*Lost*). A new Bobo production was also announced.

The show continued with a discussion of staff member Nick's numerous poorly-placed tattoos, followed by a debate on the legality of his proposed show bits, including prank calls to ex-girlfriends claiming to have HIV and interviewing children about adult topics.  This segued into speculation about the beer President Obama would share with officials at a private White House picnic, with the hosts discussing betting odds and various beer brands associated with different political demographics.  The discussion then shifted to New York City's program offering one-way plane tickets to homeless families and evolved into anecdotes about panhandling scams and experiences in mental institutions.  A picture of Phoebe Cates from *Private School* was shown.

A caller, Steve, shared an anecdote about working in a mental hospital.  The Phoebe Cates picture sparked a discussion about pubic hair, with callers offering diverse opinions and explicit descriptions, including one caller recounting a near-suicide attempt.  The conversation covered various grooming styles, hair color, and even included a description of an ex-girlfriend's exceptionally hairy pubic area.  Robert Kelly joined the show in studio, and the pubic hair discussion continued with more caller anecdotes, often using vulgar language and sexual innuendo.  Brooke Hogan then appeared, and the conversation shifted to her parents' divorce and her mother's relationship with a much younger man, Charlie.  Brooke expressed her dislike for Charlie and discussed her new album, *The Redemption*. Brooke engaged in an arm-wrestling match against Robert Kelly, which she won.

Michael Emerson (*Lost*) joined the show, and the conversation turned to *Lost*, fan theories, Michael Emerson's character arc, Comic-Con, and speculation about the final season.  A caller, Laura, expressed intense fandom for Michael Emerson.  A humorous subplot involved Robert Kelly smelling the hosts to identify a source of body odor, followed by a skit with Robert Kelly and Sam Roberts acting out a "retarded uncle" and "scared little kid" scenario.

Michael Emerson discussed filming *Lost* in Hawaii, detailing the demanding work, including injuries sustained during stunts and the challenges of working in extreme heat and with wildlife. He also mentioned other acting roles.  Following this, Robert Kelly recounted his experiences touring with Dane Cook on private jets, with the conversation taking a sexually suggestive turn regarding the jet's layout.  A significant portion of the show involved a playful argument between the hosts and Kelly about his Twitter usage and his appearance.  The show concluded with a discussion of upcoming UFC fights, featuring Kelly's extensive knowledge and a video of BJ Penn, interspersed with further banter among the hosts and Kelly, and promotion of Kelly's upcoming performances.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Ah, good morning, when these mics are on every morning, you don't know what to do first,  do you do ah, yeah, you sing along to the music, I don't like the welcome to Opie and  Anthony, all that crap, because it's so formal, I'd rather fart into the mic every morning  and get it started, would be an interesting waker-upper, it's just awkward, yeah, if you 
[00:00:30]  go from talking to four people, which we were just doing, to, I don't know, this is about  a million right now, yeah, depending on what survey you look at, just yapping, how do you  start it, you know, people ask us all the time, how many people listen to you, I honestly  don't know, not a clue, and that is, that is not, and don't think you could call in or text  in how many are, because depending on where you look, it's totally different answers. 
[00:01:00]  Everywhere's from like, I've heard as low as 200,000 people, yikes, to well over a million,  pushing two, so you gotta think it's somewhere in the middle.  I'm never gonna think 200,000.  Oh, hell fucking no.  I just wouldn't even fucking deal.  One of those surveys came out, and you know, everyone sat down and said, that's not even  close to right.  That's not the number, yeah, they had to coddle us.  And then I'm like, well, why don't you then do a freaking, you know, put out a press release 
[00:01:30]  and say, that's not even close to true.  Well, we don't want to do that.  So, who knows, if you're listening, great.  If you're not hearing our voices, go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  There you go.  Oh, it's Anthony Appreciation Day, they didn't forget.  Oh my God.  Fuck!  But it can't be Appreciation Day.  I only got an hour.  Not yet.  Yeah, you get the last hour.  How do I know?  Anthony Appreciation Hour starts at 9 o'clock.  And the beauty of that is, and I know I say the beauty of that is a lot. 
[00:02:00]  But the beauty of that is that people know there's a beauty in something.  Yes, exactly.  Well, but when it's your hour of appreciation, that's when all the guests come in, so.  Oh, great.  We got Bob Kelly today.  Oh, good.  Finally.  He told me to get a, what did he, a red dragon.  Dude, he's lost his mind.  I made fun of his white unicorn.  He goes, ah, dude, you got to get a red dragon.  And then we could tool around Manhattan together.  I'm like, no, faggot. 
[00:02:30]  Is the guy trying to bring back Quadrophenia or something with the scooters?  Well, the scooters are hot in every other city.  Not in America.  In the world.  Yeah.  In stupid Europe.  European cities are all about the scooter.  You know who rode one?  Who?  Sarah Connor.  Oh, okay.  Enough said.  Yeah, exactly.  But Bob Kelly has decided he needs a scooter in New York City.  And it's white.  And he tweeted it.  And I know my tweets are lame at times. 
[00:03:00]  I'll be the first to admit.  And I'm only going to go at times.  Yeah.  You know, I know I got some fine quality tweets.  But this Bob Kelly, his average is way the fuck down.  Way down.  That's what I need to discuss with him.  I think we need an intervention.  And I know he's going to come out to you.  Oh, you're such a...  Shut up.  Pass my dumb sunset and thunderstorm nature shit.  I do all right, Bob.  I'm not tweeting pictures of cute white scooters and calling it the white unicorn.  Just look at it.  Look at that thing.  I actually started laughing my ass off because Twitter's great on the shitter. 
[00:03:30]  That's why they rhyme.  Twitter and shitter.  Yeah.  You sit there.  So I'm, you know, doing my business.  And I'm going through the tweets.  And I see Bob Kelly's with that.  And I start reading some of the comments.  And it's like, God, I hope I see that thing twisted under a bus.  It's hysterical.  Look at that thing.  It's embarrassing.  I would ride that in, you know, in the Caribbean.  Exactly.  You know something?  Not in New York City. 
[00:04:00]  Honestly, it looks like it would be cool to ride somewhere else.  St. Thomas.  Yeah, exactly.  You went to St. Thomas and you decide you want to take a little day trip somewhere.  So you get your chick on the back of your scooter and you ride somewhere through, you know, paradise.  You don't drive that thing in New York City.  You know, I think it was Nantucket when I was first, you know, dating my girl.  You know, there was a man from there.  Yeah.  And we rented a scooter and I put her on the back.  And by the end of the day, she goes, next time I'm going to rent my own scooter. 
[00:04:30]  She gets her own scooter.  You know why?  Because she can do that.  Well, she goes, are you okay?  And I had the big goofy helmet on and we're going like 20 miles an hour.  The Dukakis war helmet.  It was kind of like the Dumb and Dumber thing.  And at that moment, I had a pretty good flashback of being 12 years old, being on a minibike.  Yeah.  And, you know, dumping the minibike in the middle of like the woods and sticker bushes.  I think, have I told a story on the air where I got cut up really bad, like close to 100 stitches in my face?  No way.  I don't remember that one. 
[00:05:00]  I had a cut through my eyelid, a cut all the way through my nostril, a gaping wound in the back of my head.  And I had to run home screaming and crying and bleeding like a mother.  You dumped it good.  And I think it was Brett opened the door and he says to this day, it just horrifies him because there was his older brother at the door just completely covered in blood because I just got ripped apart.  And I failed to tell my girl that I basically haven't been on anything with two wheels with a motor since this trip to, you know. 
[00:05:30]  And then finally we get to Nantucket and we decide to rent a scooter.  And I'm just in a, and I don't get panic attacks.  Maybe, I mean, as a human being, I guess we all do, you know, but not, not on a regular basis and nothing like that.  I was in full fucking panic attack going 25 miles an hour with my chick on the back because I was remembering my stupid mini bike action that I forgot about years ago.  But this thing was bad.  I could have, I could have easily died.  It was horrific, horrific gasoline.  There was a fire.  It happens. 
[00:06:00]  The mini bike is burning in the woods as I'm running away, bleeding to death.  It was on fire.  Oh yeah.  Jesus Christ.  I had to dump it because I didn't know what I was doing.  Was it like a mini bike or a miniature motorcycle look to it?  It was a, it was a mini, it was low to the ground mini bike, but it, it was like, uh, it was, it was Harry's.  Harry Flood, who also wanted me to run away with him when he was 12 years old.  What?  I think his name was Harry Flood.  And, and he, it was all souped up to go really fast. 
[00:06:30]  You know, he did his own tinkering at 12 years old.  And I'm like, yeah, I know how to ride this.  I was too, I was too stupid to tell him, I don't know how to ride your, your bike.  He goes, I go, of course I know how.  And I went tooling around the Washington drive, uh, the schoolyard.  And, and what I thought was the break was the gas.  And I was just going faster and faster and faster.  And now I'm like, how the fuck do you stop this thing?  Oh no.  And I just didn't know.  Oh no.  So then I'm flying by the monkey bars and all those metal apparatuses that they thought  was safe when we were growing up. 
[00:07:00]  Did he know there was a problem?  Was he, was he watching?  Oh yeah.  He was watching from afar.  Cause you could always tell when there's, someone's having a problem, especially when  they're going much too fast.  You know, there's a problem for 12, 13, I was flying.  I mean, if I look back and go, what?  I was only going that fast.  But to me, I was going a hundred.  I don't have to fuck yourself up.  Absolutely.  And then it was like, all right, do I just take it on the road, Washington drive road?  Cause I didn't know what to do.  Dump it.  And I was able to get the bike turned around again.  And now I had, I had a schoolyard to figure it out. 
[00:07:30]  One huge length of schoolyard to figure out the monkey bars and all that are flying by  on my left side.  And then I see what looks like fluffy kind of bushes off to my right, the woods.  I'm like, all right, I'm dumping it in there.  And I flew into the woods.  And what I thought was a fluffy bush was one of those hardcore sticker bushes.  Not the little ones, the ones where the thorns are really headlong into a tree.  You'd have just been dead.  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, I would have, I don't know what I've done. 
[00:08:00]  That, that was my move.  I'm like, all right, I got to dump this thing.  Yeah.  And I saw this bush.  I'm like, I can handle this.  I got to lay her down.  And, and, and there was so much speed going that I ended up in the middle of the thing.  So now I'm already cut up from flying into this thing.  Now I got to, I got to basically tear my way out of the sticker bush, getting more cuts.  And then it was, it was a, it was a close run from my house.  I lived pretty close to Washington drive at the time.  And I ran home bleeding to death. 
[00:08:30]  It's like Steve McQueen in, uh, in the great escape when he tried to jump the barbed wire.  Right.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  Trawling out of the barbed wire.  Yeah, exactly.  That's pretty much it.  So anyway, a little off-roading there, but then we get back.  Probably not as cool.  But then we get back to Bob Kelly and now he wants me to buy the red dragon.  So, so the red dragon and the white unicorn could what?  Hang out in New York City on our scooters?  Yeah.  You're going to, you're going to be all cool following each other around.  He probably has fantasies of you and him side by side, riding down the, yeah, there you 
[00:09:00]  go.  Born to be mild.  What an ass.  Just cruising down Broadway, looking back and forth at each other.  Yeah, man.  And look at us.  Everything's passing you.  People on bikes and skates are passing you.  Of course.  The bike ped guys, whatever they're called.  Come on, man.  Yeah.  Let's head this way.  With pedals on it. 
[00:09:30]  They're calling me Opie Sullenberg, Jared in Boston.  I couldn't even, I couldn't even say myself.  You don't want me.  Um, but you see the scooters in New York City, but they're commuters.  Yeah.  There are dudes with their suits on.  They look ridiculous.  And they're like, you know what?  For them, it makes sense.  Bob Kelly's a comedian.  Where's he going on his scooter?  I know.  What?  That's what I thought.  Like, where is he putting it?  Does he have a big chain that he takes with him?  Because, yeah.  Does he put it in a parking garage?  Like, I got to ask him all kinds of questions. 
[00:10:00]  And you know how many bikes I've bumped into living in New York City?  Because you don't see them when they, like, when they're parked behind you.  Because they'll park the bike sideways to get into these weird little spots.  You back it.  And then you just back into them.  Back right into it.  There's been a few times where I've backed in and took a look around.  Like, did anyone see that?  I'd love to see him come out with it big, dented, dirty, because it's white.  Yeah.  Laying on its side, just, dude, dude, dude, you know, you can't have anything, dude.  But he's a stand-up comedian that does a lot of spots in the city. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  That's the worst time to be on a scooter, because that's when all the lunatics are out.  Right.  You know, when you're a commuter early morning and around 4 or 5 in the afternoon, eh, what's  really going to happen to you?  You're kind of stuck in, you know, some traffic there.  So he tweeted that all excited, and I guess we were supposed to write back, like, wow,  Bob.  Yeah.  Congratulations.  Cool.  I mean, not cool at all.  When you go to any European city, it's all about the scooter. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, those things are all over.  Like, it is, they have taken over the roads.  Yep.  Cheap on gas, I guess.  Every scooter has two or three people.  Two or three.  I'm not, no joke.  Three people.  Two or three people on these things.  They just say Third World Nation.  Mm-hmm.  That's what it is.  And him now, you know, between Twittering too much and his stupid little scooter now,  he Twitters everything.  Yeah.  And he'll Twitter pictures of things that are just like, what the?  I realize, like, I over-tweet at times, then I back off. 
[00:11:30]  You try to find a balance with the whole thing.  You don't see, like, five in a row.  No.  When I see the five in a row, dude, I'm like, what the fuck?  I have stopped following people because they do exactly what you just said.  Like, there's a few people that I actually liked following, but they tweeted too much  that I just had a bail.  I just couldn't do the five in a row.  If I can't get my thought in 140 characters, and then I do have to go to that second tweet  immediately, there's this weird guilt, like, oh, God. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, my God.  You know, I got to make this interesting.  Well, I'm formally announcing when he gets here.  That you're not following him?  That I am.  We did this.  I am not following him.  We did this last time.  I know.  We lost all his followers, which I kind of felt guilty about.  I know, but you know something?  Because it's all he has.  It's all he has.  It's people.  And it really is.  It really is all he has.  See, because like all our friends, he's an addict, and this is his thing.  This is his addiction.  Yeah.  Twitter.  It's all he has. 
[00:12:30]  I can't be part of the, like, stop following Bob Kelly movement.  You know what?  I'm just not going to do it.  I am not telling anybody to do anything.  All right.  Good.  I am just saying my own personal thing here.  I have to stop, because I cannot sort through tweets when every other one is Robert Kelly putting his own compliment, retweeting people that complimented him, and then saying, yeah.  Yeah.  You know, oh, I saw Bob.  Was that Bob Kelly I saw outside of a bookstore? 
[00:13:00]  He looked fantastic.  And he tweeted it.  It's like, you know, I understand if you want to, you know, toot your horn a little bit there on Twitter, but I'm riced.  And then what is he doing getting all, he got a tattoo?  No, that's not his, is it?  No, it's not.  Yeah, I think so.  Don't tell me that's his tattoo.  He got a huge tattoo on his calf that says addict.  Why?  Is there a koi fish or any of that shit in there?  It's a dragon.  He's got a koi fish on the outside of his arm, like on the outside bicep, and I think this is the dragon with a flame coming up from the bottom to top, and it says addict running down, and I think that's on the inside of his butt. 
[00:13:30]  What?  No, as far as tattoos go, I don't have any, so I probably shouldn't comment.  Is that a good tattoo, Danny?  It's not bad.  It's in that classic Japanese style.  So, you know, some people like more detail, some people like less.  It is a fire-breathing dragon, and the fire is coming out of the dragon's mouth. 
[00:14:00]  Where's the dragon's mouth?  And it says addict.  Oh, I see.  Okay.  That's too colorful, man.  I'm starting to think I want a couple tattoos, a couple things that mean something to me, like a tat for, you know, my dad.  Yeah.  But, you know, something cool.  But when it comes to all this color, you don't have to do color, though.  No, I'm just saying I'm not a fan of the color tattoo.  So, yeah, some people are totally into black and white.  I like more of that black and white shading type shit. 
[00:14:30]  When you get too much color, especially blue.  Blue on a white guy?  Well, blue on a black guy is even worse, obviously.  But just blue in tattoos, I just don't see it.  I wasn't into any kind of colors at all.  And this is my opinion, which will piss people off.  I'm just saying.  But Bobby's koi fish is actually really, it looks really good.  I wasn't even a big fan of the koi fish.  And I saw this, I was like, wow, that's really nice.  And actually, believe it or not, Derek's arm piece, he's got like a half sleeve going.  It's really nice.  It's very colorful, and I never thought I was into that. 
[00:15:00]  Is he covering up half the tattoos that suck on his body?  No, this is good tats.  The arm is as good tats.  We did say that he has the worst tattoo on staff, right?  Which one was it again?  It was so bad.  I can't remember.  Remember, it's a pinup lady that's like straddling a microphone, which is bad enough.  Travis is even laughing at me.  But the art's not that great either.  It looks like a tranny face.  And he knows it's bad too, right?  Yeah, I think so.  I think so.  Of course you do. 
[00:15:30]  If you have something with a face on it, it had better be fucking good, because we have  been through the bad tats before.  Don't pull up the teeth, Ted.  That teeth, the woman, the in memory of, with the tiara she's wearing, and it's just, it  comes up, it's epic failure, and that shit is permanent, it says.  But in loving memory, and obviously the tattoo hack was working off of this photograph that's  next to it, she ain't that pretty in the first place, I'm going to be honest. 
[00:16:00]  But the tattoo they did was just, the shading is horrific.  It's amazing how bad it is.  They tried to put every individual tooth in.  Yeah.  Like this guy just did a horrible job on the hair, everything is awful, epic failure.  You've got to find, yeah, if you're going to do a portrait, you've got to find a person  that knows how to do the teeth.  The teeth will wreck any portrait.  There are people that, it looks like a fucking photograph.  Yeah, that stuff is scary.  I don't know.  I just don't know how they do that.  I know.  It's amazing. 
[00:16:30]  Some people, they just, they want a tattoo, and they just go to, they go, oh, I've got  to go to the tattoo shop.  No.  It's like the worst possible way to get permanent artwork on your body for the rest of your life.  Do some research.  The one thing I don't understand about tattoos are the people, like you just said, that go  into a tattoo place, and now just pick something off the wall.  Off the wall, yeah.  Like, I would think.  Work off the rack.  And I, what do I know about tattoos?  But I would think if you're getting a tattoo, it should really mean something.  Yeah.  Not just like, oh, I like that symbol. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  You should be able to, you know, think about, I know a lot of people that aren't artists.  Maybe your brain doesn't work in that way, but at least go, well, I like this, and this  means something to me, and then let the artist kind of, you know, come up with something a  little more unique for you.  Or even an archaic sketch, and then you could hand it to an artist.  Right.  And they know what you want and how to interpret that, but you can't just walk in, hey, yeah,  that looks good.  Because you know what?  There are probably 10,000 people over the years that have done the same thing. 
[00:17:30]  I never want that one.  It's the same tattoo.  Nothing worse than having the same tattoo.  Wow, that's sick looking.  Having the same tattoo.  Every time you see someone that has a tattoo, like, wow, you got a koala bear on your arm.  And then you're like, what does that mean?  I don't know.  I just like koala bears.  I was going to...  Like, there's no, like, real reason to have it on your arm.  I don't get that.  One of my favorite things to do is just to Google bad tattoos. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Because they're so bad.  And somebody had Japanese characters or Chinese characters running down their arm.  Oh, yeah.  That's one of my...  I don't know what you're going to say.  It was actually legitimately translated into...  Yeah.  It was like fried balls of rice.  And, like, you thought it meant, like, you know, pride and glory.  Fried balls of rice.  Fried balls of rice.  And they thought it was some deep, meaningful saying.  Oh, that's funny, man.  From ancient days.  I should get a tattoo from L.A. Inc. 
[00:18:30]  That's the problem.  Now, you got Joe in Minnesota.  We probably could get that done.  We probably have to be on a waiting list.  But we've had Kat Von D in here, and she was really cool.  She actually kind of hinted that if you're ever in L.A. or whatever.  I don't know.  Like, we've talked before.  You don't know if this shit is true or not.  But I would feel if I did that, then next thing you know, I got a sleeve or something.  So what I want, I mean, I want something really small and just, like, that means something to me.  I'm not going for a big, huge, over-the-top piece.  But if you go to L.A. Inc., you go, well, I just want this name and this symbol or whatever. 
[00:19:00]  She's going to be like, you're wasting my time.  Don't waste my time.  Like, you know, next thing you know, I'm walking out with a massive fucking back tattoo.  It's all over your face.  Right.  Like that guy in Coney Island.  And I just don't look like the type of person that could handle a back tattoo.  Yeah, these are portraits.  Let me see back.  Go back one because I got to see the – now, that's a guy that knows how to do goddamn tats.  Like, you want a picture of your kid on you or something? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Those are tats and not pictures?  Yeah, no.  These are pictures.  That's an actual tat.  These are tats.  These are tattoos, yeah.  Get the – get out of here.  Yeah, see, that's somebody that knows how to do a tattoo of a portrait.  That's not a tattoo.  No way.  This guy's amazing.  That is.  Where are you at, Dan?  That guy is amazing.  Everybody can go and check out danhank.com.  He's a local tattoo artist.  Used to be out of New York.  Now he's in Austin, Texas.  Dan Hank, H-E-N-K, right?  Dan Hank, h-E-N-K.com.  All right.  Cool.  Wow.  He's amazing. 
[00:20:00]  How do you do that?  That's painting on people's skin where it's not like – it doesn't even look like a tat.  We're looking at colored portraits.  Opie.  Tattoos.  That term is very dated and very offensive to some people.  Yeah.  Well, that – oof.  Maybe the kid looked like that.  Yeah, what's wrong with that baby?  I've seen this guy's art.  I'm sure that's –  That's exactly what the kid looked like.  You're not blaming the artist?  Oh, boy.  That's not good.  No, it's –  That's exactly what the kid looked like.  Everybody's kids can't be the cutest thing ever. 
[00:20:30]  I understand.  Sorry.  That's pretty screwed up.  The Here's Johnny.  You see that.  I mean, this is – I remember seeing this a while ago.  Damn.  It's amazing.  Yeah, it's pretty damn good.  See, he knows how to do the teeth.  It's all about the teeth.  Yeah.  It's not –  You've got to figure out how to do the teeth.  Teeth aren't just black lines running up and down.  Squares.  Or rectangles.  Just rectangles.  With too much dark in between each tooth.  There's no shading to show the curvature of them or anything like that.  That guy's epic fail. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, that guy's really good.  Let's say hi to somebody in West Virginia.  You mischarged $10, $20 a tat, huh, Dan?  You know what?  He's not –  All right.  Ruin my bitch.  Shut up.  He's not as bad as you think.  As bad as you think.  All right.  West Virginia checking in.  First call of the day.  It's Opie and Anthony.  How are you, buddy?  Hey, what's happening, boys?  Hey, man.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  No, Jimmy's filming a movie.  Jimmy's not here.  Oh, Jimmy's booked again?  Jimmy will be back, I think, Friday.  Yeah.  For a day, and then I think he leaves again next week. 
[00:21:30]  So he's been Twittering from the set.  The set.  Yeah, with Brooke Shields and Patrice O'Neal.  Did you see a shitty trailer that they gave him?  No, I didn't see it.  That's horrible.  I was – it felt weird.  I was off the grid yesterday.  Yeah.  I even had to apologize on Twitter.  I feel like I had to apologize.  Like, sorry, it's off the grid today, guys.  I'll be back tomorrow.  Yeah.  So I'm way behind.  I got to, like – and I read every fucking reply.  Yeah.  And if you're a true hater, then I just stop following.  Yeah, then it's easy. 
[00:22:00]  Then you're done.  Gone.  You know, I don't need that.  Yeah.  You know, there's plenty of places to go hate.  Not on my Twitter.  Screw them.  That's what I say.  I dump people left and right because it's not about that with me.  West Virginia, what do you got?  Yeah, so talking about those mopeds.  Obviously, they're big out in Europe and all that.  But Nantucket, they put such a large tax on the ferry to get your car over there that nobody – it's so dense over there. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, is that what it is?  People do the mopeds.  So a buddy of mine, we rent the mopeds over there a couple years back.  Like doing the old Dumb and Dumber scene, like trying to film each other, driving down the road with moped, sleeves out, like head up, big helmet.  And, you know, Nantucket being all built in, like, 1800s and shit, that roads are cobblestone.  He, like, turned – he was driving down the street with cobblestone all wobbling about.  And, like, turned to get his photo shot from me, hit the curb, and crashed right through some lady's front doorstep. 
[00:23:00]  So, like, the wooden steps completely all in shambles.  There's, like, trellis work, like moped stuck inside it, trying to get the thing out of there while, like, he's bleeding from his arms.  That must happen a lot, though, when people, like, rent scooters.  They just must crash all the time.  Because all they do is they go, do you know how to drive one of these?  Yeah.  You got a license?  Yeah.  All right, here you go.  Here, take it away.  And you've never driven one before?  I don't know.  I can figure it out.  It's like a bicycle, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:23:30]  You just full throttle into something.  You got to rent one of those Jeeps when you go to Nantucket.  That's the way to go.  Yeah.  Oh, these fucking Jeeps rule.  Rent this big house there.  It was, like, a 15-bedroom house.  Nice.  I'm dancing on Nantucket.  It's just good.  Right on.  50 people there at night.  You hit any of those waves?  I forgot what beach.  Well, why are we going local?  Thank you, West Virginia.  Yeah.  Also, I turned it into a personal phone call.  Carl. 
[00:24:00]  Hi, what's up?  It's Anthony Appreciation Day or hour.  I don't even know.  Well, later.  Later.  We got to say that Opie is the mental Bruce Lee.  He's the red-headed Bruce Lee.  Yeah, Bonaduce might be able to kick your ass, but, hey, you can take anybody on mentally.  Now, Anthony, I'm a quote-unquote musician, and I moved from Rhode Island down to the south,  and we can get an apartment for, like, 500 bucks in the hood, and I am so freaking paranoid  because these freaks walk into our yard all the time. 
[00:24:30]  And we have this dog named Zeke, and Zeke's available about 80% of the time,  but sometimes he's upstairs, and sometimes he's not around, and he's fucking crackhead walking into the yard.  Did I miss something?  And now I walk around with a Rambo knife on my belt, but I wish I had your gun with the scope and the light on it.  Oh, that would be so nice.  I hate you.  I thought you were done. 
[00:25:00]  Boring.  So to speak, literally.  We're kings for nothing!  Could be.  You know, we've been on a roll with callers.  Oh, yeah.  I got to tell you, tell the callers, we have been on a roll.  You guys have been really good.  Because of that guy, less calls today.  Yeah, that guy just ruined it.  Who's this? 
[00:25:30]  Chinese tattoo guy.  We don't have a name for you.  Joe?  Hey, what's up, buddy?  You got something?  Yeah, I went in, got a tattoo in the back of my neck.  I got animals all over me.  Went in, got a tattoo in the back of my neck that was supposed to say nature.  And I ran into a Chinese friend of mine and said,  what's that say in the back of your neck?  I said, nature.  She says, no, it says sex.  It says sex?  Yeah.  Are they just fucking with us?  They fuck with people, I guess, because you don't know what the Japanese symbol means.  Well, in the book, Eric, it said nature, gender, sex. 
[00:26:00]  We figured, you know, like American English, there's three different meanings.  But it means the natural sex between two genders.  So, all right.  But it still looks like cool Chinese writing.  It does, yeah.  I mean, when I see the Chinese writing on anybody, I'm like, hey, that's cool.  Yeah, whatever.  I'm not thinking what it really stands for.  Who cares?  Imagine if you still saw some Asian guy walking around with, like, a hamburger.  It just says hamburger on his arm.  You'd be like, what the fuck is he? 
[00:26:30]  Why would he put a hamburger on his arm?  Right.  Yeah, I ain't got no problem with it.  Yeah, just like, I like getting fisted.  Yeah, something like that.  I guess you're right.  Goodyear tires.  Yeah.  You'd be like, what the fuck?  Why do you put Goodyear tires on his arm?  I guess that's a little inside joke for all the Asians out there.  They see us, all the dummies with Chinese writing on or whatever.  They just chuckle.  And they're like, ah, look.  Ha, ha, ha.  Dummy.  All right, boys, I love you.  I don't want to make my call a bad one, so I'm going to hang up right now.  Oh, that was good.  Very good.  I didn't know that misspelling thing or mispronunciation or miss, what am I trying to say? 
[00:27:00]  Miss America?  Miss.  Miss, uh, no, when you get the Chinese writing and misinterpretation, misinterpretation.  I like that, sure.  Now we're going with bad tattoos?  We weren't going down this freaking...  All right, hold on.  Let me, we might as well do bad tattoos for a couple more minutes.  Kevin in Connecticut.  Is this the Kevin from Connecticut?  Yes.  I like your tweets, my friend.  Thanks, thanks.  I like yours, too.  Thanks.  What a love fest.  Look at this. 
[00:27:30]  All right, what do you got?  I got a bad tattoo.  Yeah?  Uh, I got a lightning bolt in honor of my brother who was killed.  He drew his own, and I didn't know what it was, so I looked, and I'm like, okay, let  me get the lightning bolt between the AC and the DC.  That's cool, right?  Yeah, sure.  How do you fuck that up, by the way?  I mean, because it says bad tattoos, so in my mind, I'm like, how the fuck do you fuck  this one up?  Yeah.  Perfect, but Google image the Gatorade logo.  Oh.  It's the same fucking thing.  Oh, no way.  I just tell people I love Gatorade.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  It's a shorter story.  Oh.  But don't you have the AC-DC on the arm, too?  No, I just have the lightning bolt.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, then.  I can clear it up and get the AC and the DC, but it just, it hurt too much.  Yeah.  That means gay, doesn't it?  It's a little AC-DC.  It's a nice, yeah.  Well, see, that's, I didn't want to do that.  What does AC-DC stand for, as far as the band goes?  They're faggots.  I would just think AC-DC.  Power.  Just power, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  But your brother drew the lightning bolt?  He drew his own, and had a guy put it on. 
[00:28:30]  So...  This is, like, almost 30 years ago, so I don't remember what it was, so I'm looking around  going, hey, I'll get that.  Oh, I see.  So it's not even the one he drew.  Right.  Oh.  I don't want my own, but it would have sucked.  Yeah, I gotcha.  People get a little, I think you got a little time passed by after losing a loved one before  you get a tat, like, based on that person, because you might just make a big mistake.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Kevin.  Bye, guys.  Let's go to Space Trucker.  Space Trucker! 
[00:29:00]  I'm just looking.  Hi.  Good morning.  You're just lonely, eh?  I'm just looking.  You're just lonely.  No, you're just lonely.  There's just something going on that...  Are you hinting towards something?  Am I nostalgic?  I think you're just lonely.  I'm so lonely.  I'm Ron Reed.  You want to get the word out, or no?  Yeah, I get the word out.  No, not her.  No?  That's, you know, that ship has sailed.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  That one's done. 
[00:29:30]  Let's go, Space Trucker.  I've got two sons, and being typical boys, they were going through a very rebellious stage,  and I had raised my sons to have pride in being who they were.  So, my oldest, in an attempt to show me he was his own person, went out and got a tattoo,  except he had our entire last name tattooed across the top of his shoulders like a sports jersey. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, shit.  That's pretty bad.  And, God, I love him, but I told him, I said, you do know that it's permanent.  Wow.  Like a sports jersey.  That's big.  I don't understand the one-piece big tattoo.  I understand when it all is, like, sort of like separate tattoos that come together.  Yeah, yeah.  But the one, like, you ever see the tramp stamps that are a little too big?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:30:30]  Like, if a girl gets a tramp stamp, if it's the right size, that is really sexy, right?  But then you see somewhere, they went too large.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Yeah, it's like wrapping around their hips.  Exactly.  Giant, big, thick.  Space Trucker sounded like, uh, help me out, prank callers out there.  Uh, the terrorist, uh...  Oh, oh, oh, that guy, the country-sounding guy.  You concrete walker.  Yeah, walker.  What the hell was it?  The, uh, the terrorist.  Some of that shit was really funny, man. 
[00:31:00]  Telephone terrorist.  Telephone terrorist or something?  Yeah.  Maybe you can find a good one going on a break, if you know what I'm talking about.  Let's go to, uh, Mongo the Trucker.  Mongo.  Morning, guys.  Hey.  I know that ship has sailed, but you don't want to go on that ship, because it leaks.  But, um...  Oh.  Oh, oh, Mongo.  Oh, sorry.  Yikes.  When I was stationed over in the Philippines, uh, I had, between, you know, $5 hookers and  getting drunk, uh, I had a tattoo of, uh, supposed to look like my skin was ripped open, and 
[00:31:30]  there's snake skin underneath.  Uh-huh.  But the guy showed me a picture of the snake, and I said, that'll work, but I thought he was  looking, you know, looking at the pattern of the skin.  Right, the scales.  And, but I wanted, you know, green snake skin.  So, but he did it, this weird fucking color with these big scales, and now everybody looks  at it and says, oh, what is it?  And I'm like, that's the worst thing you can have.  Oh, no.  You never want... 
[00:32:00]  Okay, whatever.  Oh.  You never want that to be the first question.  What is it?  Right.  You want them to know exactly what it is.  Yes.  You want them to go, wow, that's really cool.  Hey, hey, fuck down.  What do you get for $5?  Uh, four hours.  Shut the fuck up.  You get it?  You get it?  This is back in, I was there in 89, uh, yeah, 89.  Oh, okay.  It was $5 for a short time, which is four hours or 20 bucks for all night.  20 years he's talking. 
[00:32:30]  So you get, yeah, but still, five bucks 20 years ago?  That's still, yeah.  That's still really cheap.  That is pretty cheap.  Probably going to get what you pay for.  All right.  Well, no, you get some really good looking...  The women over in the Philippines are either drop-dead gorgeous or they're butt-fucking ugly.  There's no in-between.  So.  Yeah.  Well, all right.  All right, Mongo, thank you.  Mongo.  Uh, let me say hi to Rich in Queens.  You want to go down this road for a while, Rich?  Yeah, what the fuck?  Rich. 
[00:33:00]  Hey, boys, what's up?  Hey.  Um, the summer my grandmother died, my brother, uh, turned 18.  So his first tattoo says, in memory of Alice.  And he was all proud and emotional when he came home to show it to everybody.  And then, like, you know, this whole family's sitting there.  And I said, you know, that was a good TV show, but I don't know if it warranted a tattoo.  And he, like, lost it.  He just, like, ran out of the room.  He was, like, so upset.  You can't cry over your tat.  It's not like a chick with a hair.  Thank you.  When she gets a bad hair, hairdo. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, really.  And gets, I hate it.  Uh, touch, touch tone terrorist.  Thank you, guys.  That was it.  A lot of people calling with that one.  Uh, oh, Jesus.  Let's go to TJ in Atlanta.  TJ.  Yeah.  Hey.  We're still looking at bad tattoos.  What site is this?  Are you just Google imaging bad tattoos?  Yeah, just bad tattoos, awful tattoos, bad portrait tattoos.  Wow.  You can look at this stuff for hours.  It sucks that there's so many bad ones.  It's just poor sons of bitches are walking around like this. 
[00:34:00]  TJ.  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah, the, uh, one day at work, I was sitting there talking with some, uh, co-workers about  bad tattoos and bad places to have them.  And I just made the random comment that the trashiest spot for a lady to have a tat is right  there on her tip.  And, uh, lo and behold, this lady just sits there and gives me this god-awful look and  pulls her shirt half open.  And there she has a black panther clawing its way up the side of her tip. 
[00:34:30]  That was, that was always a bummer seeing a tattoo on a breast.  Yeah.  I don't, I don't, maybe the women could call up and explain that one.  Like, I, I, I like.  It's supposed to be cushy.  Huh?  It's supposed to be cushy, smooth, and nice.  Yeah.  I don't, I don't want anything in that area.  Like, like women and their tats could, that could be really, really hot if it's done right.  Yeah, there's plenty of places.  When they start messing around with the, with the breast area, it's like, I don't get that. 
[00:35:00]  What are you looking at?  I don't know.  It's, this guy has two giant cocks on his back coming.  That's not a real tattoo, is it?  It's gotta be.  Jesus Christ.  It really does look.  Now, are you into the gay bad tattoo?  Yeah.  Google imaging?  Gay bad gay tattoos.  Yeah, bad gay tattoos.  Uh, Justin in Detroit.  Is it cold in the day?  Of course it's not.  It's summer.  How are you, Justin?  Always.  How you doing?  All right, man. 
[00:35:30]  Hey, my buddy's got this, uh, lizard on a BMX bike doing a trick, and it's got a caption  that's supposed to say reverse, but it says revief.  Yeah.  Misspellings are always good.  Always good.  Misspelled tattoos.  Ah.  That's all I got.  Yeah, this guy with, I'm awesome.  There you go, man.  That's a favorite one.  Yeah, I'm awesome.  A-W-S-O-M-E.  I saw a kid, he was a rather large fella, and he had this giant grim reaper, and it wasn't 
[00:36:00]  a great tattoo in the first place, but a giant grim reaper back piece, and on top it said,  it said, you're next, but it was the wrong your.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Not you are?  That was like your, like, your books or something.  Your.  David in Washington.  David.  Oh, what's up?  Hey.  Okay, my mom has this tattoo, when she was 40-something, she was dating this 25-year-old  fucking putz who was an Aussie fan, and he went around and called himself Aussie. 
[00:36:30]  I think we haven't mentioned that.  Seriously.  And so her tattoo is like the Saturn with an S-shaped ring, you know, but tilted sideways,  so it kind of spells Oz, if you look at it, from a certain point of view, I guess.  And it's got these bullshit lightning bolts underneath it, which, according to Aussie,  were supposed to represent the Nazi SS. 
[00:37:00]  Now, I'm a black guy, okay, and my mom's white, and my sister is also half-breed, so I  don't think the SS thing is really, I don't think my mom's heart was really in that.  Yeah.  And it's got some, like, some bullshit stars that look like asterisks, basically.  Yeah.  It's just the most meaningless tattoo I've ever seen, and the guy, like, left her for  a younger, half-retarded person. 
[00:37:30]  I like this David guy.  Half-retarded.  You can tell a story, David.  Nice.  All right.  Thanks for sharing, brother.  David from Washington.  Steve in Vegas.  Steve.  Hey, what's up?  Good evening.  Hey.  I was sitting in a tattoo chair one time getting about $1,400 put on my back, and about halfway  through, the guy says, oops.  Oh, no.  Why did he say oops?  Did you ever find out?  He was all coked out and just forgot what he was drawing.  Did it turn out good in the end? 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, it's pretty good.  He had to cover it up.  He had to cover up his oops.  That's good.  I got another one.  I knew this stripper back in the day, and the average trance stamp going right down on the  middle of the back.  She had the, you ever play skee-ball?  Yeah, of course.  The little score going all the way up her back.  You know, the bottom back was like 10, 20, 30, 40, up between the shoulder blades was  about 100, you know, for when you're aiming.  Oh, my God.  Like, so when you shoot a load, it could end up on a score?  You could actually keep score? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  My body needs to have a contract.  That's a, that's a...  Yeah, another thing is using various body parts incorporated into your tats, like having  a pussy with a coin slot, you know, and it looks like a coin slot on a machine or something.  Can we see some of those, Dan?  Those are just...  Some of those dirty, uh, dirty tattoos.  Dirty pussy tattoos.  Dirty pussy tattoos.  There's a guy that's, uh, bald.  Is this...  That's not a real tattoo.  That's gotta be, like, a fake one.  Looks like a tad of a guy mowing the grass, and it stops right at his balding line. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, see, cause...  So it's cleared his head off.  Because, yeah, well...  Yeah.  That's, uh...  Yeah.  Was that a midget?  I don't know what that was.  I didn't see the front.  Someone wrote...  The head looked big.  Someone wrote, go get a net and catch him.  Keith Jay in Niagara Falls.  Oh, this is a...  Was that a midget?  You don't know either?  I didn't see.  Oh, you didn't see?  What the...  Go in search of the midget.  Okay.  There's not a lot of people here yet. 
[00:39:30]  You'll find the midget quickly.  This idiot has tattooed legs with red high heels and fishnet stockings and garters on  his underarm, and then the armpit area is the pussy, and then another leg going down  his side a little bit.  So when he lifts up his arm and shows his armpit, his armpit hair looks like a big, hairy pussy.  Who would do that? 
[00:40:00]  That guy.  Obviously.  That guy.  It looks like he probably did it smashed drunk during spring break or something.  Right.  He looks like one of those assholes that would do that.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.  Ooh.  What is this?  I can't read this.  Bad.  Huh?  Oh.  Slaughter?  There's a rapper named Crooked who's part of Slaughterhouse, and he wanted to get like  a Slaughterhouse tattoo.  So it says Slaughter down his entire forearm. 
[00:40:30]  Except it's...  There's no H in it.  Oh, really?  It's S-L-A-U-G-T-E-R.  Yes.  Slaughter.  Slaughter.  Slaughter.  Oops.  Ow.  Someone's saying Google Mr. Cool Ice.  Worst douchebag tattoo ever.  We see that one?  Yeah, I've seen that before.  Is that guy's...  Danny's seen everything.  What the fuck?  Oh, is it good, Dan?  Mr. Cool Ice?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm not sure if it's real or not.  Yeah, it's fake.  It's real. 
[00:41:00]  Because it just kind of looks like Sharpie.  Let me say...  Sharpie.  Let me say hi to Gene in Pennsylvania.  Gene.  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  I'm a real cheap fuck, and I'm a mechanic, and a tattooist needed work done on his car,  and I spent, like, countless hours fixing his car, and he was going to tattoo me for free.  So I want a flame on my forearm, and I have a pile of tattoos, and he shaded them, and they're  fucking pink.  They're pink?  Yes.  I have flames from my wrist to my elbow, and they're such a light shade of red, they're 
[00:41:30]  pink.  Can't you get that...  Can't you get it to look like red?  Yeah, call it in.  Well, as soon as it finishes...  I mean, it's not finished healing yet.  As soon as it's done, he's going to try to shade them in darker, but it looked really  gay.  We're looking at pussy tattoos.  With the devil.  The devil.  And it's devil's, like, mouth.  Would be the...  Yeah.  All right, guys.  I'm driving.  Thanks.  Thanks, Gene.  See ya.  There was a lot of...  What would possess a chick to do that? 
[00:42:00]  Wow.  That is just...  You want to put your dick in that?  No?  I don't know if that's...  I'm trying to think if that would be hot or not.  No.  We're looking at, like, another devil's...  Mouth.  Mouth.  Face.  The whole thing.  Head.  It's a real horrific-looking face with devil horns, and the mouth is, like, open wide,  and, of course, it's the vagina itself.  No.  No?  No.  That's just creepy. 
[00:42:30]  Because then it turns the pussy into, like, a homo experience, because now it looks like  you're getting ahead from...  Yeah, like, in this case, you're getting ahead from fucking Willie Nelson.  You're fucking...  His chin hair, his beard.  The pussy hair is now incorporated into the beard.  But you're pushing your penis into now a male devil's mouth.  A gentleman's mouth.  It's like, what happened here?  Let's say hi to Tony in Jersey.  Tony. 
[00:43:00]  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Anal starfish tattoo, Dan.  Google image that, please.  No way.  Tony.  Yeah, hi.  Hey, I got a friend of mine.  He got a Christ head, and I don't know if he pissed off the tattoo artist or what,  but he got to put a big hook nose on the Christ head.  Oh, jeez.  Really?  The nose is too big?  Oh, man.  And you can't miss it.  I mean, everybody that looks at it is like, holy shit, what the hell is going on with that?  It's only an angry Jewish gentleman.  Yeah, absolutely.  Thank you, sir.  That anal starfish is so hysterically mad. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, come on the fuck out of here.  Come on.  How do you explain that?  The asshole is the middle, like the mouth part of a starfish.  You ever turn over a starfish and look at it?  That's the asshole.  And then the five arms are radiating out through the legs.  Would you have sex with that?  Ow.  That would creep you out, right?  It's just creepy.  All right, we're just about done with this.  Cousin got your name here on his ass. 
[00:44:00]  Just found a two-girls-one-cup tattoo.  What?  I saw that one, too.  Two-girls-one-cup.  It's not that good.  Got two W's tattooed on my ass for a while.  You want any of these in?  In Iraq, the soldiers used to write fucked-up shit on kids.  No.  I want to see bad tattoos go to Point Pleasant for the weekend.  What is that?  That's two-girls-one-cup?  Oh, that sucks.  That's terrible.  That's the worst.  That's like a Derek tattoo. 
[00:44:30]  I think it's the same artist, right?  It looks like it.  Poor Derek.  They look like Barbie dolls.  They're supposed to look semi-human, right?  Yeah, the proportions are all wrong.  My brother-in-law got a blue unicorn on his arm and thought it was cool.  Guy got a tat of a girl on his chest.  Now looks like she's drooling.  Why is that?  Let's go to Gene in Florida.  Gene.  Yeah.  Hey, I got a buddy of mine.  He had a tattoo on his breast right over his heart of a woman's face, but his arm was 
[00:45:00]  up over his head while he was getting it, so it looked all good and well, but when he  stood up and put his arm down, the woman's mouth looked like she has Bell's palsy.  He had to fix it, but the only way they could fix it is make the lips larger and darker  than black, so now it's this big old black-lipped woman.  It's real creepy looking.  Oh, that is bad.  That's great.  Danny just showed us a tub girl tattoo. 
[00:45:30]  You got to see the tub girl tattoo.  What body part is that on?  I can't even tell because it's too close up.  That looks like...  I'm not sure.  It could be like the back of the calf.  It could be like a forearm.  Why would you do that?  Why is the question?  Oh, that's right up here.  It would be where you would put a band on.  It's like inner bicep area.  I don't understand people that get internet fad tattoos.  It's like, why would you do that?  That is just...  Well, tub girl, that's going to be around for a while, though. 
[00:46:00]  That's pretty funny.  Legendary.  Let's go to David in New York.  David.  Hey, my boys.  Google Homer Simpson pussy, Dan.  Oh, yeah.  I've seen that one.  Have you seen that one?  Okay.  David in New York.  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey.  Big Pink Floyd fan.  Loved the side of the moon.  Wanted to get my first tattoo, so I got that.  Went to a party.  Friend of a friend was like, hey, he didn't know Dave was gay.  So, why?  Well, he's got rainbows and tattoos, rainbows and triangles on his leg.  Oh, great.  Thanks.  But can't people tell us the dark side of the moon? 
[00:46:30]  Well, I guess not gay guys that were hot for me.  Are you kidding me?  That's like a legendary logo.  Absolutely.  I was devastated, but I get to tell that story now for the last 10 years.  Have you had it covered up, or are you just like, fuck it if you don't know what it is?  Absolutely fuck it if you don't know the dark side.  Yeah, exactly.  Right on.  Still one of the greatest albums of all time.  Oh, yeah.  That fucking dark side of the moon is ridiculous.  It's starting to be underappreciated, because it's finally...  Enough time goes by.  It becomes just old. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, but it was on the charts forever.  Yeah, forever.  Forever and ever.  That album is ridiculous.  Yeah.  Some guy put a portrait of the guy that did Chocolate Rain.  That's dumb.  On his arm.  Why would you do that?  I don't know.  Let's go to Anthony in Boston.  Anthony.  Oh, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey.  A couple years ago, me and my buddy shat drunk down in New Orleans, and a couple of  my friends bet me.  I don't even remember, but I have a picture now.  I woke up with Wilma Flintstone blowing Fred on my side. 
[00:47:30]  It doesn't even stop there.  My other friend had a nipple ring, and he has a hand grenade, so it looks like the pull  tin with a hand grenade on his nipple.  Jesus.  Punch it out.  Thank you, sir.  Bye, boys.  That's pretty bad.  What do you got now?  It's an orangutan head, and it's a woman.  She's kind of, you can see from behind, she's lifting a leg up as if you had a fart. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  And it's from the back, so you can see her pussy from behind, and the pussy is the orangutan's  mouth.  It's the same.  It's fake, but this is the same picture that they used for that Homer Simpson one.  The Homer Simpson one.  It's the same.  Yeah.  What do you mean it's fake?  It's just superimposed over her ass.  Like, I'll show you.  Let me pull up that Homer one, and you'll see it's the same exact stock photo.  You would think a stripper out there would do that.  It would be her thing, right?  Her thing.  Why not?  To get some tips.  If it pays the bills. 
[00:48:30]  Because then people would go to the strip club and go, holy shit, you've got to see  this.  I see this.  Oh, yeah.  It's the same thing.  Yeah, you're right.  All right.  Why don't we go to break here?  Just getting started.  We've got Bob Kelly coming in.  Brooke Hogan.  Yes.  I guess her parents got divorced officially yesterday.  Yeah.  So this is good timing for us.  We'll talk to Brooke Hogan about the divorce of her parents.  I'm sure she can't talk about details, but I sure would like to know.  Well, she's dissing her mom, I guess, with her new album, with her new song.  What the Hulkster's got to pay.  And Michael Emerson from Lost is coming in today.  Yes. 
[00:49:00]  That's definitely happening.  I hope so.  And you want to go backstage with the naked cowgirl?  Yes, I liked that one.  All right, let's do that one right now.  We also have a new Bobo production called Bobo Loco, a grindhouse trailer.  Bobo Loco.  Yeah, we'll do that after break.  That's pretty good.  What's up, B-Rock?  What happened?  We found somebody else on our staff that has a really bad tattoo.  This is Nick, right?  Yeah.  Nick has one on his foot.  What do you got on your foot, Nick?  Why would you get it there, first of all? 
[00:49:30]  No matter what it is.  Explain why you got a tattoo on your foot.  I just kind of felt like it.  I kind of have to, like, I don't know, hide it as well from my mom.  It's a baboon.  Well, you can't obviously see it from here, but.  Why do you got to pop it up on the table?  Why?  I don't know.  He's got a huge baboon tattoo on the top of his foot.  Jesus Christ.  What does it mean, though?  It means absolutely nothing. 
[00:50:00]  The art's not bad.  Yeah, that's why I got it.  The art's not bad at all.  It just looks good.  But why did you decide you needed it there?  I don't know.  Just, uh, I thought it would be a good spot for it.  It'd be cool.  It was free, so.  You thought wrong, sir.  Do you like baboons?  Yeah.  Now you do.  Obviously, yeah.  I got food tattooed on my lip.  What?  Food with an arrow.  Yeah.  Is that an arrow?  Yeah.  Pointing in, like, why would you get that? 
[00:50:30]  It's free.  Yeah, but it doesn't matter.  Not everything that's free is good, man.  Being killed is free, too.  Right.  Getting blown by a homeless guy is free, too.  I got my other foot tattooed, too.  You got what?  My other foot.  So, tops of both feet?  Yeah.  It's just an anchor with a, it says, by the sea.  It's a song.  By the sea.  What's free?  Free.  This guy loves the free tats.  I don't get the lip. 
[00:51:00]  What's the circumstance with the inside of the lip?  That says food with an arrow.  I don't know.  You just decided.  It just felt like it was free.  Were you drunk?  No, no.  Are you all right?  Yeah.  All right.  You crazy?  I don't know.  A little nutty?  A little nutty?  Did that hurt like a motherfucker in the lip?  No, it wasn't that bad.  By the sea, what song is that?  It's a song by this band, Modern Life is War.  Is it a cool song?  Yeah, it's a decent song.  Decent?  I got it tattooed on.  It's got to be your favorite song of all time if you got it tattooed on the top of your  foot.  Better stay your favorite song, too. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, boy.  Nick is indeed crazy.  He is crazy?  Yes.  Sam knows everything about everyone.  Sam has no doubt about it.  Why is Nick crazy?  I kind of like this kid, by the way.  We haven't been able to use him properly yet.  He's the newest crazy intern.  Oh, is he?  He's pitched me some bits that he wants to do.  Yeah.  One of them was, have another intern pose as a doctor and call his ex-girlfriends to  let them know that Nick has tested positive for HIV.  Jesus. 
[00:52:00]  It's kind of a good bit.  Not taking anything away from the bit, but he is crazy.  A little nutty.  That's just edgy, man.  That's, you know, he's a shock job.  Yeah, that's all.  A shock job.  He's a shock job.  He's a shock intern.  He also wants to go out on the street and insult children.  He wants to find children on the streets of New York.  And insult them?  And insult them.  In what way, Nick?  Like, how would you insult a child?  I don't know.  Just interview them and, like, ask them about how they're enjoying New York, and then just  start asking them questions about, like, prostitution in New York, and that, like, their parents 
[00:52:30]  will get really angry at me.  All right, wait a minute.  Now, all right, let's not just say no to this.  I'm not saying no.  Hold on a minute.  Right.  Is there a way we could do this, Sam?  Well, I'm not sure of the legalities of interviewing children.  I tend to, when I interview, I try to go over 18.  All right, maybe prostitution's taking it a little too far, but what if Nick went with  very over-the-top adult subjects?  Maybe if he went up to families and said, hey, I'm, you know, working for Satellite Radio, 
[00:53:00]  do you mind if I interview your kids?  Yeah.  And then they said yes.  Yeah, that's why I was just like, oh, can I interview your child about...  I think there's a way of doing this.  And then he interviews...  For real.  I think you're right.  ...asks inappropriate questions and records the parents' reaction.  You just got to keep it relatively safe as far as our jobs go.  We would definitely have to look over the questions.  Yeah, yeah.  Give it the old pre-listen.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why don't you come up with a list of questions, and then me and Ann will look them over. 
[00:53:30]  Or maybe you have to go talk to someone down that long hallway, the other side of the building  that we refuse to go to, the Forbidden Zone.  The Forbidden Zone.  That's the Forbidden Zone.  We rarely go past that railing down there.  Yeah.  Which is about 50 feet away.  Yeah, let's see if we can do something with this.  That's right.  Wow.  That's it.  Well, you know something?  You make Sam look big.  You do.  Like, look at how big Sam looks. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, and Sam, you're a little nothing.  Ah, no, because look at him.  Yeah.  That's not true.  Well, you're just kind of like, what do you weigh in at?  Uh, 140.  Yeah?  Do you guys want to hear By the Sea?  Dan just shakes, tickles, Jesus.  Anyone else want to hear this By the Sea song?  He's got a tattoo on the top of his foot.  Do we have it?  You got it?  Wait, what?  It's called By the Sea by who again?  No, I only have...  Modern Life is War.  I only have three Modern Life is War songs, and that's not one of them, so...  Wow, really?  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:54:30]  Picked an obscure one to put on your...  Bring the CD in so we can listen to it.  Did that hurt on the top of your foot?  Like, there's a lot of ligaments there and stuff.  Yeah, it's like, it's all bone, so it kind of...  Yeah, yeah, that's...  It wasn't that much fun.  Ow.  And you got there to hide from your...  Hide him from your mom?  Yeah, because I still need, like, a place to live, so...  Wait, he's got more...  You don't understand.  He just said no to the tattoo thing.  You got more tattoos.  Because they're free?  Oh, yeah.  No, I don't have any more, but I plan on getting...  Oh, okay.  Plenty more.  Like, like, like... 
[00:55:00]  You got to think, though.  You're going to have these tats long after it matters to your parents.  Yeah.  So you should have put them wherever you want.  Yeah, I suppose so.  All right, Nick.  We're going to start paying attention to you.  Try to figure out this bit, because I think...  I think there's something there.  We just got to make sure we have jobs after your bit airs.  That's all.  Oh, you got a little piece of the song?  I think it's a live show.  Oh, wow. 
[00:55:30]  I can't even tell.  It's live.  We'll try to find a better version.  It's the live version.  I'm sure the guys down the hall can find it.  We'll at least take a listen to see what it's about.  Someone just writes, this song is great.  I couldn't even hear anything.  All right.  Thank you, Nick.  Thank you, Sam.  We're going to take a break.  Sam, we're doing your backstage with Sandy Kane as we go to break.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Oh, by the way, I think most of us are not fans of Mayor Bloomberg. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  But he suggested something this morning or yesterday, but the news is reporting on it today.  It's classic.  It's great.  You're going to love it.  Wait, you mean good great?  Dude, when I tell you what Bloomberg wants to do with the homeless, you're going to be  like, holy shit.  What a tease.  You're not part of it.  And you're going to love it.  Believe it or not.  All right.  Believe it or not, you're going to love it.  I don't agree with much of what Bloomberg does.  And I hate to tell you, but you and the prez like the same beer, my friends, because 
[00:56:30]  they're trying to figure out what beer they're all having down at the White House.  Oh, is that it?  See, I knew they're good.  And details on how they're doing it.  Remember we were talking about that yesterday?  Yeah, yeah.  Lame, lame, lame.  We'll give you the details next, but first this.  Are we on?  What's going on with that?  Oh, there we go.  That's us.  All right.  Well, I know they moved over to a new system this week, so we're working out the bugs.  Bugs!  If the bugs aren't worked out by Monday, then all hell will break loose. 
[00:57:00]  Yes.  We'll give you a week.  That's all you get.  That's right.  So, Colin or Colin?  Colin Powell.  Colin Powell criticizes the way Henry Gates dealt with Sergeant Crowley.  Really?  Yep.  Okay.  Yep.  Henry Gates is losing on this one.  What did he say?  I don't know.  That's just the headline.  I don't need to read further.  Okay.  That's it.  So, Obama likes Budweiser.  Ah. 
[00:57:30]  Sergeant Crowley, like I said yesterday, likes the blue moon.  Yeah.  And I don't know if we know what Henry Gates likes.  Mm.  Beer-wise, anyway.  There you go.  I'll just ring the bell.  Yeah.  I'll leave the bell here.  And they have the odds in the paper.  Can somebody get me the paper?  I don't have my copies in front of me.  It's going to have to be, uh.  They have the odds on what beer they're going to be drinking at the White House.  It's going to be whatever Obama wants.  So, what do you think?  But.  But I.  They're in a weird situation because I think the White House has basically said they don't 
[00:58:00]  really want to say which beer because it would turn into.  For the endorsement.  Right.  Which is bad for the White House.  The White House really isn't supposed to be endorsing things in general.  They're not endorsing beer.  But, I mean, it'll come out.  I mean, let's say it's Budweiser.  The Budweiser people will get the.  All over it.  They'll get it out because that's huge marketing.  The paper here in New York saying the favorite, Anthony, is a beer we were talking about yesterday.  Sam Adams.  Are you kidding me?  Well, there's odds. 
[00:58:30]  I wonder if in Vegas they're betting on this.  There probably are.  So, that would.  All right.  Because why?  The patriotic kind of.  Well, it happened in Boston.  Patriotic.  Yeah.  There's a lot going on there.  The choice of political consultants because it's Boston brewed.  Obama's known to favor locally grown products.  I'm sure.  So, the Sam Adams is a two to one.  I'm sure Jim Cook would like to see that.  You want the outside?  The long shot?  I don't know this beer.  So, if I'm pronouncing it wrong, please help me out. 
[00:59:00]  Mow?  Mowler?  M-A-L-H-E-U-R?  Is that how you say it, Dan?  I have not heard of it.  All right.  It's a high-end Belgian brew for connoisseurs.  It brings a hint of citrus and a whiff of elitism along with it.  Yeah.  That sounds like.  Maybe if John Kerry were coming over, you know, because that's what they wrote.  Because, you know, they've got to kind of be fun with this.  Of course.  And then they, uh, then the next long shot is? 
[00:59:30]  Um, Colt 45.  Coors?  Why would that be a long shot?  Coors is the next long shot at a million to one.  The Rocky Mountain beer from a company with a biased, tinged past could end the sit-down  before it begins.  Oh, what?  Coors is a racist little thing?  What's going on with Coors?  What's the Coors, um, controversy?  Yeah, I need to know what the Coors controversy, if someone out there knows.  Because the guy's name was, uh, Adolf Coors?  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  I didn't even know there were jokes associated with this.  Let's go with Rob in Nebraska.  Rob? 
[01:00:00]  Hey, uh, from what I heard, they're going to be drinking a dark beer there at the White House.  Like a Guinness?  Very nice.  Guinness would be nice.  They should do a black and tan.  A black and tan.  Yeah.  As long as it's a dark beer.  All right, we got it.  I like it, man.  Jesus Christ.  You did well.  Stop.  The first time.  Sometimes you get that line out, and as we're laughing, you hang up, and we look and go,  where'd you go?  We need more comedic genius from this guy. 
[01:00:30]  Well, I'll remember that next time, but let me tell you, dark beer, I bet you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I bet.  All right.  The next long shot ant?  Hmm?  The Lopweiser.  Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba.  Uh, a beer, I'm just going to spell it.  I've never heard of this one.  T-S-I-N-G-T-A-O.  Oh.  How do you say that one, Dan?  Sing-sau.  Sing-sau.  That's a Japanese beer.  Yeah, Japanese rice beer.  I know some of the Japanese beers.  I've never heard of this one.  Oh, you'd recognize it if you saw it.  I do my sushi, and I get my beers. 
[01:01:00]  I get those Japanese beers.  If you saw the label, watch.  Really?  You're guaranteed you've seen this.  What are some of those other Japanese beers?  Uh.  Sapporo?  I can't remember either, man.  Yeah, I know the other one.  I get it all the time.  I know.  Uh.  Ying-ling.  It's actually not, though.  No, it's not.  I was going to say, because it feels like it should be a Japanese beer, right?  Uh, the Sing-  Ichiban.  That is a beer. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, that's right.  Uh, Sing-sau?  Sing-tao?  What did you say?  Sing-tao.  Sing-tao.  The president's trying to improve relations with China, but this is going too far.  That would be a 1,000-to-1 shot.  Yeah, I don't think-  Well, how is Coors a million-to-one, but Sing-tao is 1,000-to-1?  They just made these odds up without even-  No, something happened with Coors, and we need to know what the fuck happened with Coors.  Yeah.  Oh, okay, here we go.  Uh, Tim in Chicago.  Tim.  Yo.  Hey.  Hey, guys, I don't know who this guy was, but I know either the founder or one of the presidents 
[01:02:00]  of Coors is supposedly a grand dragon in the Ku Klux Klan.  Well, that could be a problem.  It might just have a little something to do with it.  Is that a rumor, or is that, like, something we can look at?  It's a rumor that I've been reading on the internet.  Rumor?  Rumor?  Rumor?  What are some of those other rumors?  Uh, blanket hurts the light.  Steer the kidneys in a hotel room.  Big killer's hook on the door of the car.  Toothbrush up his ass. 
[01:02:30]  Take a picture.  Turned over the plate at the wedding.  Those are more urban legends.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rumor.  It's not the rumor.  All right, so now we go with the next, uh, now we get into the favorite category, I guess.  Those were the long shots.  Heineken.  500 to 1, they're drinking Heineken on Thursday.  Well, Heineken, uh, why is it 500 to 1?  That's kind of an upper...  Well, they explain.  Low end, upper.  Upper low end.  Heineken is smooth, but this, uh, green bottle brew is not made in the U.S. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, okay.  I guess it would be bad if Obama doesn't pick a, uh, a beer made in the U.S.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, isn't Budweiser, didn't they just get bought by, uh, a company from, like, where?  Yeah, I think they did.  Sweden?  Denmark?  Somewhere over there.  Anheuser.  Anheuser.  Anheuser.  All right, now we get into some...  This is, uh, the next one is 100 to 1, uh, Yingling.  Yingling.  The slightly bitter aftertaste might remind Obama of his failed everyman attempts in the 
[01:03:30]  Pennsylvania primary, which Hillary Rodham Clinton won.  So I guess he won't be drinking that.  Failed attempt.  Even, uh, even something as simple as having a beer, they gotta, like, overthink it and go,  all right, we gotta figure this out so we don't piss anyone off and we don't endorse anything.  The red tape.  I bet you they're gonna have a bunch of beers and they're just gonna randomly pick one so  no one can prove that their beer was drank.  I bet you something like that comes out.  Yeah.  You watch.  Budweiser, 10 to 1 in, appeals to the patriotic Joe six-pack crowd, message, we love America. 
[01:04:00]  Meanwhile, it's a Belgian beer now, I think.  And, and Budweiser doesn't need the help.  They should help one of the little guys, like a, like a Blue Moon.  But no one's gonna, like, really go for it.  Well, Sergeant Crowley likes Blue Moon.  Why can't they all pick their favorite beer and that's it?  Yeah, that's what they should do.  Uh, believe it or not, the next favorite, oh, uh, Budweiser was, uh, all right, Budweiser  was the second favorite, okay?  The third favorite, which I messed up, was, uh, Pabst Blue Ribbon, working class, easy  on the wallet, and Wisconsin Made, which set a heartland tone, 25 to 1. 
[01:04:30]  That beer is terrible.  Yeah, I don't like that at all.  What about Meister Brow, the master brew?  That, I'd rather drink that than the Pabst.  Milwaukee's Best?  Will they be drinking Milwaukee's Best?  The Beast, as they call it?  Can you imagine if freaking Obama just pulls out a big old malt liquor?  A 40.  Just a big 40.  Spills some on the Oval Office floor to his homies?  No, it's not in the Oval Office.  Remember I said, okay, where's this beer drinking gonna happen?  No, where's it gonna be?  And what was cool, um, they did a piece on TV before the show that I was watching, Reagan 
[01:05:00]  stopped into a hardcore, uh, porno, uh, well, hardcore Irish, I believe, Irish bar up there  in Boston when he was, uh, running for, for the presidency.  Yeah.  And, and they were all Democrats up there, and they said he was so freaking cool, he, he  pretty much turned everyone around in the bar.  That was Reagan.  And he was in a bar drinking.  Clinton went to that same bar, I guess his bar up, up, up there in Boston is famous  for, uh, uh, Clinton and, just Clinton and Reagan, both, you know, so they talked to 
[01:05:30]  the, the barkeep up there, and they're like, wow, we really wish they would do it up here,  but nowhere they're doing it.  It wasn't Cheers, was it?  No.  Nowhere they're doing it?  Where?  White House, on the lawn, picnic table.  Yuck.  What?  Yuck.  That picnic table by the playground?  Probably.  Yeah, that's, uh, that's, uh, that's kind of out of view of the press.  Yeah, they got a picnic table, and they're gonna have a beer, and they're saying, uh,  uh, Thursday night, they're stressing night, meaning Obama's, you know, done with his, uh, 
[01:06:00]  with his job.  Right, right, because drinking in the daytime is crazy.  Yeah, because then everyone would be, because then the stupid press down there are like,  all right, what, what did he decide on, you know, after he had his beer?  Yeah.  And is this acceptable, America?  He had one beer and went to sleep.  Went right to bed.  Just lame.  I mean, it sounded cool when this all came out, but a beer on a picnic table, out back.  It'd be great if they'd just get sauced, start throwing racial epithets at each other because 
[01:06:30]  they're angry and drunk.  Wakes up hungover.  Sleep on a picnic table.  It just turns into just a mess.  It's just, it's even worse, and they made matters worse by getting drunk and just yelling things  out that they don't mean and shouldn't say.  We've all been, we've all been in that situation where you go to someone's house for one beer,  all right, I'll have a beer.  One more.  And then, like, just days later, imagine that, that whole scene plays out. 
[01:07:00]  One more for the road.  Oh, boy, here comes mad.  Yeah.  They're all pissed off.  They're on the roof of the White House.  Let's take the limo out, man.  They should fucking just jump in a car and go to a local bar and just do it right.  And just kind of cause a bit of a frenzy.  Why not?  A little press?  A little publicity?  So that's the beer thing.  Well, have fun.  What do you think?  What do you think, though, beer-wise? 
[01:07:30]  I would just, yeah, keep it simple.  Go with Bud.  But that's what I would do.  Why not?  It doesn't need the help, though.  Help a little guy out.  But why make this a big issue?  That's just it.  It doesn't need the help.  So people buy Budweiser now.  They would still buy it.  We're going to yell that.  That beer I mentioned is Chinese, not Japanese.  Sorry, Tony.  I think I said it was Chinese.  I think I said it, too.  It sounded Japanese to me.  Come on.  Relax.  Like, anybody would know. 
[01:08:00]  Like, anyone in Japan or China knows if something's American or Canadian.  Oh, Molson?  Yeah, that's an American beer.  Oh, okay.  Let's say hi to Maurice in Newark.  Maurice.  Yo, what's up, man?  Hey.  Hey, didn't on Monday they mention on the Eyewitness News that three beers, it was like a Pabst brand  and a Bud and something else, something weird.  Blue Moon?  Blue Moon.  That was it.  The Blue Moon keeps coming up because Sergeant Crowley said, look, that's my beer.  I like Blue Moon.  That's what the officer mentioned. 
[01:08:30]  So, why would they have this going on?  I don't know.  I don't know, Maurice.  I hate Maurice.  You don't like Maurice?  I hate Maurice.  Why?  What did he do?  Because he's repeating everything we've said already, and then he repeated what you just  said.  You go, yeah, because the police officer goes, yeah, the officer wanted it.  And next thing you know, everyone thinks Maurice is brilliant.  Wait a minute.  Yeah, Maurice is brilliant.  Hey, I like Opie.  What's the matter with you?  You just, you're Mr. Repeat guy.  Maurice, what?  Get the papers.  Simple as this. 
[01:09:00]  What?  We should fucking have some kind of weird contest with, like, solid money involved.  Yeah.  What beer are they drinking Thursday?  I'd say Bud.  I'd go with Bud.  I'm going to go with Bud.  And a Pabst.  No Pabst?  Yeah.  So Obama just pulls out a Bud watcher.  And I said Bud, and he said Bud again.  Dude.  I'm reiterating.  It's just going to be three glasses, beer in them.  It's going to be, it's going to be, it's, I don't even think it could be dark, because  then they could go, all right, all right, it's a dark beer.  So you think it's going to be the Pilsner glass? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  It's just going to be so generic, it's going to look like beer.  You know what I mean?  Whatever you picture beer in your head as, that's what it's going to look like.  No logos on the glass, no cans around, no bottles.  And then you have to be sitting there figuring out what beer it was.  And then they'll get the experts on Fox News and MSNBC and CNN, and they'll be studying  and going, I think that's more of a Budweiser, right.  And then they'll have like, they'll probably set up beers in the studio and pour them in 
[01:10:00]  and compare it with the color of the beer in the pictures.  I think this is going to get really obnoxious and ridiculous.  And then you'll have like the guy, they're going to have pundits on trying to figure out  what beer it was.  The guy in the White House kitchen who actually pours it, they're like, okay, pour the beer.  Thank you.  He's just done.  They drag him out.  You think it's going to be Dharma Initiative beer?  They love that. 
[01:10:30]  That's pretty good.  Let me say thank you, Maurice.  We love you too.  John in New Hampshire.  John.  Hey, what's going on, bud?  Hey, John.  Hey, those guys need to be drinking some Red Hook.  Red Hook.  Red Hook Ale.  Yeah, Red Hook's all right, man.  I don't think they're going to do anything.  That's a long shot, though.  Anything obscure.  That's what they need.  They're saying the favorite, we said a few minutes ago, if you were listening to Maurice,  Sam Adams.  Sam Adams.  Yeah.  I bet you it's either Sam Adams, Budweiser, or they might do the Blue Moon for Sergeant 
[01:11:00]  Crowley.  I don't think they want to placate him that much.  Really?  Yeah, it's like he chooses a beer.  Screw that.  Yeah, but if you invite someone to have a beer, what's the first thing you say to that  person?  What are you drinking?  What are you fucking drinking?  If they're coming over to my house, they've got to drink what I have.  Or bring their own.  That's kind of true.  What's the guy going to walk up to the White House with his six-pack?  Damn, that would be hysterical. 
[01:11:30]  Just walks up to the gate.  Does Obama home?  Dude, I'm a lame Corona drinker.  Yeah.  If I was coming over to your house, I said, you know, you'd have some Coronas laying around?  Probably.  Sure.  So fucking Obama should have some Blue Moon laying around that White House.  Supposedly he likes drinking beer watching SportsCenter.  He's just a regular guy.  Really?  Just sitting there having a few beers watching SportsCenter?  Are you?  Kicking back, puts his feet up, drinks.  I don't buy into any of that shit.  Chugging down, smoking cigarettes, yelling at the old lady. 
[01:12:00]  The old ball and chain.  She's kind of hiding lately.  Yeah, good.  Her is, she's hiding, and so is that Biden, just like I told you.  Oh, yeah, Biden, they've got to keep him quiet.  They're giving him weird assignments just to keep him away.  Clam him up.  He will, if Obama gets another four years, there's no way Biden goes for the ride.  I don't know.  They usually like keeping the incumbent ticket together.  They'll figure out a reason why they've got to make a change.  Yeah.  It's just going to be a prop that says beer on it. 
[01:12:30]  Beer.  You think?  Like the old beer cans that Archie Bunker used to drink and stuff on sitcoms.  I remember watching Roseanne and, like, they never had any name brand for it.  Yeah, it was just beer.  Beer.  Soda.  Yeah.  No frills.  Let's go to Ed in Atlanta.  Ed.  Good evening.  Hey, Ed.  Good evening.  Hey, boys.  Hey, I can't believe anybody picked up on this.  One of the original stories on Fox News when this first came out was that Gates said he loved Red Stripe.  Can you think about that? 
[01:13:00]  That's got to be, like, the perfect scenario for racial harmony.  You know, he can give Crowley a swig of the Red Stripe.  He could start doing the funky dance.  The Jamaican beer.  And then Gates is like, hooray, beer, at the end of it.  Hooray, beer.  Yeah.  Everything comes out.  That is good beer, though.  That's right.  Thank you.  I do like that.  All right.  Well, there you go.  We'll have to wait and see.  Of course.  Coors hires a ton of illegal immigrants.  The Coors rumors are amazing.  Everybody speculating.  Ooh.  All right.  Bloomberg, the mayor of New York City. 
[01:13:30]  He's got some crazy ideas.  I don't like most of his ideas.  Well, the Times Square thing is ridiculous with the lawn chairs.  Silly.  The lawn chairs.  Actually, beach chairs.  Yeah, beach chairs.  People are sitting there.  I love when you go down there and you see, like, you know, rubes from somewhere else visiting Times Square sitting in those chairs, not knowing that some homeless guy, that was his bed only a few hours earlier.  Bed.  He's shitting in it.  He thinks he's sitting on a toilet.  And he shits his pants and makes a flat shit pancake in his pants. 
[01:14:00]  And then gets up and some rube sits down in the chair and wonders why.  To enjoy Times Square.  Yeah.  Homeless shit juice.  Wonders why they're itching for the rest of their visit to New York.  Got fleas and fucking fleas in their mites as they're trying to enjoy a Broadway show.  I just gave myself the hiccups again.  Oh, God damn.  That's disgusting.  So Bloomberg, speaking of the homeless, has come up with a pretty good idea. 
[01:14:30]  Listen to this one and tell me what you think, Anthony.  Mayor Bloomberg is offering homeless families a one-way ticket out of town.  It's all part of a Bloomberg administration program to keep the homeless out of the city's expensive shelter system.  Under the program, the city will purchase one-way plane tickets for homeless families to leave the city as long as a relative is willing to take them in.  So far, more than 550 families have taken the city up on the offer.  None have returned to the city's shelters. 
[01:15:00]  That's all it takes to get the homeless out is give them a one-way ticket?  Fly them out.  It's as easy as that.  And fuck the relative angle.  Just tell the homeless, look, where do you want to fly to?  Here you go.  Here's your one-way ticket.  Good luck to you.  Because it's like if a relative isn't going to take them in, they'll be homeless somewhere else.  But you know what?  There would be a war.  That's probably what the problem is.  If there would be a war between the cities, then what about all the other people from, let's say, San Francisco being shipped to New York? 
[01:15:30]  They'd be like, hey, get out of our town.  We're going to ship you to New York.  We would just be rotating the homeless all around the country.  You've never been to San Francisco, right?  No.  You think there's a homeless problem in New York City?  Oh.  San Francisco's homeless problem is ridiculous.  Well, because they're even more liberal than New York City.  That's the reason.  So you can't even touch a homeless person.  They're like one of those hoot owls.  They're like a fucking owl.  You can't disturb them.  You have to step over homeless people to get into the fine restaurants in San Francisco.  Yeah.  Because no one wants to move them. 
[01:16:00]  Because that would be a bad thing.  It's horrible.  It's against their rights.  And they run in packs.  Do they?  Oh, yeah.  Scary homeless people.  What?  Huh?  What's what?  I was looking at a picture going, what's her problem?  She's got a big thing written down.  And if you're homeless, she's pregnant and trying to get through another day.  Yeah, is she?  If you're homeless, because I see this in New York a lot, and I do hand out the money.  Yeah.  You do?  Yeah, I do, actually. 
[01:16:30]  Don't get too wordy with your sign.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I start reading, and I'm like, I don't want to read this much.  Yeah, there's like a whole big piece of cardboard, and it's filled up with words.  And I like the guys, and it might be a scam at this point, and that's okay, but I like  the guys that are completely honest and like, look, I'm homeless, and I want a fucking  beer.  Give me a few dollars.  I like those.  I like the signs that have a little realism to them, a little comedy to them.  This guy wrote, why lie?  I want a beer. 
[01:17:00]  I like those.  Yeah.  But I've also read those could be more or less like scams.  People that aren't doing that bad and figured, look, I can make a lot of money with a sign  like this.  Well, it's all a scam, I think.  What do you mean?  I think all these people are scamming.  My favorite homeless thing ever, and unfortunately, we have to blame Giuliani for cleaning up this  city, because this city used to be a lot of fun to walk around in, because it was just  insane what was going on.  Yeah.  And I forgot what paper did an article on it, but there was a whole industry where people 
[01:17:30]  would buy unwanted human beings, basically.  You know, the ones that have no arms, no legs, all sorts of fucked up things happening.  And then they would put these people up in these horrible, like, you know, apartments.  Horrible.  Horrible living, you know, situations.  And then in the morning, they would, you know, corral all these people that are down 
[01:18:00]  on their luck in ways you don't even want to imagine, put them in a van, and then they  would drop them off all over Manhattan.  So you're Joe Worker coming in with your suit, you got your family in the suburbs, and you  don't know any better, and you see a guy on the sidewalk with no arms and no legs begging  for money, like, God, yes, how much do you need?  And then, I guess at 5, 6 o'clock, whatever, when everyone commuted back to the suburbs,  then the van would come along and pick up all these people and throw them back into these  horrible living situations.  And obviously take the money. 
[01:18:30]  And take all the money.  Yeah.  Wow.  And they shut those people down.  But that was a scam that was pretty big.  I'm trying to think, maybe like in the late 70s, early 80s, that was happening.  Well, that's pretty good.  That's a good scam.  Why not?  And now, one person, including myself, you see this person with no arms, no legs, you're  like, how the fuck did they get there?  Like, they had no means to get there.  No, one of those rolly skateboards that they do.  Oh, like Eddie Murphy?  Yeah.  Most of them, I think, are scams. 
[01:19:00]  I think most of the people that are hand-handling are scamming.  They also nailed Garbage Bag Lady.  I was about to say, yeah.  We all saw Garbage Bag Lady.  This lady was so believable.  She's just walking around New York like, how'd you lose your clothes?  She was barefoot.  She would be just sitting against the building in a plastic garbage bag, and she'd have the  most, she was able to put this real pathetic look on her face, and kind of just hold her  hand out, or just sit there, and people would throw money at her.  Just throwing tons of cash at her. 
[01:19:30]  Someone's going, yo, I saw Slumdog Millionaire.  I'm telling you, I'm not getting this from the movie.  This actually was happening here in New York.  Obviously, it still happens in other places.  Slumdog Millionaire brought it to everyone's attention.  But I saw the real thing here in New York.  Yeah.  But anyway, so Garbage Bag Lady.  Garbage Bag Lady.  And then it turned out she had a locker somewhere.  What was it, Grand Central or some shit?  I don't know.  And she would go down to the locker and put her garbage bag in there, pull out some clothes.  Yep.  And there she is. 
[01:20:00]  And go home.  Go home nice.  She'd go to a nice place.  She would lay on the subway steps.  Yeah, yeah.  That's when I knew something was up, because I'm like, all right, if you're homeless, at  least you can figure out that the subway steps are not that comfortable.  Not where you should be laying down.  Laying down.  And people would pretty much have to step over her head to try to get to their subway.  She put in the effort, though, because if you're willing to lie down on a New York City  sidewalk with roaches just crawling on you.  And just bag.  Filth in a garbage bag. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, she was naked, except for a garbage bag.  And the garbage bag would fall down, and you'd see horrendous tears.  She was horrific.  Filthy.  Just awful things.  Was that makeup she would put on?  Like, filth makeup?  No, I mean, you can turn yourself off.  That's easy.  Roll around in some filth.  I remember one of the local papers, after they busted her on the scam, they had a huge  picture of her.  Just like she was wearing a running suit.  And she had headphones in, and she was just jogging.  Like a really nice.  Keep it in shape.  Because I used to see her all the time.  I used to see her up on 59th and Lex locally in Manhattan. 
[01:21:00]  She was there all the time.  Yeah.  All the time.  I would love to hear from the scammers today.  I know you're out there.  Because there's people that have figured out, you know what?  I can make so much more money acting like I'm down in my locker homes.  Panhandling, yeah.  Which is unfortunate for the ones that are really fucked up.  Yeah.  The ones that are really fucked up are so fucked up, I don't even think they know how to  do, to panhandle.  Those are the ones that just sit there like that lunatic guy that sat there with the cup.  They used to yell at us with the lipstick.  Right.  Like he was crazy.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:21:30]  And he was homeless.  He was a genuine crazy person.  Oh, yeah.  That other guy that used to sit on the fucking...  Mac?  Yeah, Mac.  I miss Mac.  He's got to be dead.  He's got to be dead.  Black homeless guy with like, he had elephant legs, basically.  Yeah, his legs are all infected and fucked up.  Like, those are the people, though, that just wander around and look for shit and scavenge.  That's why I think the ones that are looking for money, especially in places like Times Square  and shit, they're all just scam artists.  They're all fucking fakes.  The guys with the shopping carts, they can't even see the shopping carts anymore. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And it's just like, it's like, it's like the Grinch, how the Grinch had the fucking...  Yeah, yeah.  With all the presents in the sleigh.  You see these guys with the shopping carts, like, that looks exhausting.  Like, the great thing about being homeless is, because I've thought about being homeless  for a while, just...  Yeah, why not?  For real.  It's so freeing.  It's called being a bum, Jules.  But this fucking guy has taken the freeing experience of being homeless and making it 
[01:22:30]  exhausting.  His cart, his fucking, his fucking shopping cart had a way well over a hundred pounds.  Just get a job.  And it was all just a bunch of shit.  Just bags and bags full of just shit.  Garbage.  Just junk.  Some of them go around and collect cans.  I love when you...  Early in the morning, when you come into work, it's fun, because you see these homeless guys,  and they'll get into some garbage.  The old garage, especially.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Before I moved over here.  And they'll find, like, a piece of wire or something, and they sit there, and they just 
[01:23:00]  stare at it.  Oh, wire.  And they're like, I...  And then they get all excited, and they grab it like it's very valuable, and they put  it on their shopping cart, and like...  And you know in their head, like, I know what I could do with this.  But they never do anything with this stuff.  No.  It's just they collect it.  It's just all in their minds.  They collect it.  I would love to ask them, what are you going to do with the wire?  Going to strip it and sell the copper for a penny.  Chris in Atlanta, yeah.  Uh, 96 Olympics, yeah, we remember this. 
[01:23:30]  They gave one-way tickets out to bums to clear out Atlanta for the Olympics.  Yep.  Uh, Mac in Atlanta, it's called greyhounding to give tickets out like that.  Um, so, I guess it's not an original idea from the mayor.  Well, the thing is, they need family members.  Right.  Like, what...  Is the family so broke that they can't buy him tickets?  They don't want the guy?  And if they don't want the guy, then it doesn't matter who's paying for the ticket.  But, like, what all of a sudden makes them go, all right, I'll take him.  Right.  It's like, well, why now, motherfucker? 
[01:24:00]  Why don't you, you know, come to New York, pick him up?  Yeah.  And bring him home and clean him up.  Well, there's the story of the old guy, the old homeless guy, that they found him,  his family found him, came to New York to try to convince him to come back.  I think he was from Denver.  You say no?  That was a big story a couple summers ago.  And the guy, they were all excited.  Like, we found our long-lost brother.  He's been in New York for, like, 25 years or something.  No one knew where he was.  And the whole family came, like, brothers and nephews and nieces and his own kids. 
[01:24:30]  And I think one of his parents were alive.  What a homecoming.  They tried to have an intervention in the middle of, like, some fucking shit-strung fucking gutter.  And they couldn't talk to the guy in the company.  He's like, no.  And they all left.  And I've seen the guy since.  He's just still wandering around out there.  See, that's some guy that just wants to be homeless.  Homeless.  Yeah.  He blew off his family and friends years ago.  He just said goodbye.  I think, like I said, I think he was from Denver and moved to New York.  And that was it.  Most of them are mentally ill or raging alcoholics. 
[01:25:00]  So there's nothing you can do about it.  And what are you going to do?  There's nobody that really gives a flying fuck enough to have an intervention.  And they don't want to do anything.  Right.  Fuck them.  I like the fly them out plan.  But I just, why family?  Just fly them out somewhere.  You know, because there's not even a lot of homeless.  Oceanic 815.  Don't fly out.  Making a lot of lost references today.  Michael Emerson coming in. 
[01:25:30]  Michael Emerson, hopefully.  930.  Brooke Hogan at 9 o'clock.  And Bob Kelly.  Is Bob Kelly coming here on his white unicorn?  That's what we need to know.  Yeah.  Does he park it?  Does he chain it up to a pole?  What is he doing with that stupid little scooter?  That fruit scooter that he rides?  Oh, Daryl from PA.  Yeah, we'll find all that.  We're going to ask him a lot of questions about that.  Come on.  Don't be like Tyra wanting to be homeless.  I remember you guys doing a story on that a year ago.  Oh, God.  Her being homeless was one of the best bits. 
[01:26:00]  It was so bad.  Whenever any of these talk show hosts go, I'm going to find out what it's like to be homeless  by actually spending a night out amongst the homeless.  Isn't that just staying out late one night?  Yeah, it's camping out.  Who hasn't partied and all of a sudden the sun's coming up?  There you go.  You were just homeless for a night.  And the Tyra thing was great because she didn't even spend the whole night, didn't she?  She was like, it got too dangerous and I had to leave.  Yeah, sure.  Sure it did. 
[01:26:30]  And she cared.  I think there was like a young woman that was homeless.  Yeah.  She was sort of following around.  You think she still keeps in touch with that woman?  Oh, I'm sure of it.  Or after she got the ratings from the young homeless woman, she moved on to the next thing to exploit  herself.  They do that, though, where they dress up in crappy clothes.  They don't wear makeup.  And then they're like, look, I'm just like the homeless.  Nah, you know what?  You have a home.  You know you're going back to a nice warm shower and then a nice soft, comfy bed. 
[01:27:00]  So you don't know what it's like to be homeless.  Don't act like it.  Let's say hi to Nick in Pennsylvania.  Nick.  Hey.  Hey.  Love you.  Love you too.  Hey, I had an uncle, right?  He's in Detroit.  He was an engineer for one of the car plants up there.  And then after work, he would go out and he would like be all dirty and everything.  He used to walk around with wads.  I mean, wads of cash, man.  Like a big wall of cash.  It was unreal. 
[01:27:30]  You got to think, I mean, it's got to be freeing to a point.  Well, not worry about like relatives and friends and bills and all that shit.  Yeah.  And especially if you got like a stash of money that you could go to.  Why not?  Yeah.  I always thought maybe being committed to an institution would be like freeing.  Really?  Yeah.  Kind of like in a cuckoo's nest way without the lobotomy at the end.  Well, they made that look kind of cool to do.  Yeah.  Like, like you'd be the shit.  You'd be like the king shit of the mental institution, you know, because, you know, you're 
[01:28:00]  not really mental, you just kind of get in there and you're able to hang around in your  pajamas.  I think, didn't Joe Costanza say that once?  It was like, yeah, you know, you're in your pajamas all day, your slippers.  But then you're fighting for your life every day.  Well, maybe.  It's cool until you realize, holy shit, these people want to kill me.  You could use Jedi mind tricks on those motherfuckers, though.  You could say, well, a guy might want to kill you, but then you could totally freak him out  just by saying something.  And then he runs away screaming and you're like, I'm, I'm like God in here. 
[01:28:30]  I'm God.  I'd be God in, in that, uh, in that place, in an institution.  I've been to a few of those places.  Yeah.  But yeah, but I'm talking just kind of being like, you know, you know, they're exhausting.  They're tiring.  But, but that's if you'd know someone in there.  Yeah.  I'm talking, you just go, you just go like, oh, yeah.  That's a treat every day.  Uh, go ahead.  Uh, yeah.  I'm just talking to you. 
[01:29:00]  That was not little Nicky, by the way.  Um, yeah.  You, you don't know anybody.  You just, uh, you take a little time off and just go in and, you know, you're in your  PJs, you go to the day room, you watch some TV, you play some games with the lunatics.  Until, until someone comes into the TV room and decides they need to watch the most horrific,  ridiculous thing on TV at full volume because it's part of their problem.  You tell them that Jesus came down and, and told me to tell you specifically, because 
[01:29:30]  he's watching you not to watch what you just put on.  And now, since you have it on, the every, Oh, wait, wait, Jesus.  He's very mad at you.  He's very, very angry.  Ah, and then he runs off screaming.  You change back to what you watch.  You know, I do have some experience.  Like I said, hanging out in these places.  I got to tell you, Anthony, if that was something that would work, that would so work.  I think I'm onto something here. 
[01:30:00]  Cause the paranoia.  Wow.  Yeah.  And then you throw Jesus in there.  You throw Jesus.  You got to throw Jesus into everything.  Jesus or aliens.  You got to pick out which ones.  Cause they're not going to sit there and go, shut up.  You're crazy.  No, they're crazy.  They're crazy.  And they're like, really talk to them.  Wow.  This guy talks to Jesus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  You have to keep an eye open.  You know, you don't want to go to sleep.  No, you're not going to sleep very heavily.  No, they'll figure out ways to kill you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Even though they take all your shit away.  Trust me.  They'll find some stuff. 
[01:30:30]  It'd be fun.  They'll smother you with the entire mattress.  This guy in Vegas cleans himself at truck stop pumps and people just fork over loads  of cash.  There you go.  The homeless guy at the FDR was wearing a bucket on his hand.  What?  Craig in Jersey.  Craig.  Yeah.  No, the homeless guy in the FDR this morning is dressed up like a farmer.  He's got a rake in a broom and a huge sign about Jewishness.  I can't figure this guy out.  Is he drunk? 
[01:31:00]  Stoned?  What's going on?  And what?  He has a bucket on his hand?  No, no, no.  Well, actually, three days ago, he had a watermelon hollowed out on top of his head running around  the middle of the FDR.  Two days ago, he was dressed up with Tarzan running around with his spirit.  That's that Tarzan?  Well, you think he's crazy or you think he's like, you know...  A gimmick.  Occasionally, he's got signs that say, I'm not drunk.  I'm not stoned.  I'm just high on life.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  Hi, I'm life.  All right.  Come on.  That doesn't make your ride in great.  Trying to figure...  You know, you can't wait to see that guy every day.  A carved out watermelon on his head?  Jesus.  That is funny.  Right on, brother.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Yeah, that's true.  Jay in New York.  Jay.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I've been to fucking plenty of those institutions, and the only way you're the master or the  king around there is if you beat every motherfucker in Connect Four, because it's boring. 
[01:32:00]  That does seem to be the game of the mental institution.  The key is the Connect Four that's just sitting there in the torn box.  Yeah.  That and staring through the windows looking at the girls because you're separated.  And you want those girls that are the most disgusting girls ever, but at that time and  moment, you just want to beat the shit.  I mean, you just want that. 
[01:32:30]  This guy's crazy.  Dude, you're a lunatic.  You want to beat the shit out of him?  I love the crazies.  Not beat the shit out of him.  It's just like, you're like, oh, my God.  Look at that.  That's neat right there.  Like, I was in a wheelchair at the time because I was like, what?  I was like, messed up.  But I was like.  What's your story, dude?  What's your background?  Like, why were you in there?  Why were you in a wheelchair?  Well, I was kind of tripping out on, like, I was like 15 and I was taking a lot of pills  and stuff. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  And basically, I jumped off my roof just playing around with my friends who were jumping off  my second story roof.  Broke my foot.  Dad kicked me out.  I went to the mall and I sliced my wrist, but.  Oh, so they thought you were killing yourself.  So they put you in the mental place.  Were you like.  Broke, nobody wanted to help me.  Like, nobody was there for me.  You know?  Aw.  So, yeah.  Poor guy. 
[01:33:30]  So I stayed there for four months and then I went to a residential, like a boarding school.  Wow.  What do you do now?  Someone's attitude changed.  Got a little Jimi Hendrix for me there, Travis?  Now, you, uh, yeah.  What do you do now?  Uh, nothing.  I'm talking to you.  Oh, my God.  He's fucking dead.  So you guys are great.  At least we can bring a little sunshine to his life there.  Thank you, Jay.  Hang in there, will you?  All right. 
[01:34:00]  Don't say hang.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I was thinking about the kitten poster.  Yeah, yeah.  What is that one?  Yeah.  Hang in there, baby.  Things are going to go.  Or something like that.  I don't know.  And he just hung up on his own.  That's creepy.  Oh, boy.  People want to know why I was in a mental institute.  Figure it out.  Institute.  I'm in the institute.  It wasn't because of me.  No.  I knew some.  I had to learn about those places from a very early age.  Yeah, I knew some chick that was in there, like, when I was, uh, about 20 or so. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah?  Some chick was in there, and she was, uh, like, uh, 16 or something.  I used to go up to visit her.  It was, like, Huntington Hospital, fifth floor.  I thought, man, wow.  Go up there.  You want me to?  It's like, ooh.  You want to let me draw a map?  Yeah.  You're kidding me?  Yeah.  The old fifth floor.  Safe here on the old fifth floor.  I've done a few laps down that long hallway, trust me.  With the doors and the guards and, yeah.  Yeah.  And then you're not allowed to visit in the room itself, huh? 
[01:35:00]  No, you're going to come out to the whole visiting area.  Yeah.  So they can watch you.  Yeah.  Next thing you know, you feel like you're in that place.  I was just trying to get laid.  I know.  But I figured a lunatic was easy.  I was trying to be a good son.  Oh.  This girl looked like Phoebe Cates.  Really?  Yeah, she looked like Phoebe Cates.  But just fast-shit crazy?  Fast-times era.  Really nice.  And, yeah.  Bat-shit crazy. 
[01:35:30]  And she, I think, took a bunch of pills or some shit.  And I used to go up there and visit her, like, every other day or something, just being like,  oh, man, I've got to fucking try to get this.  Did you ever get some?  No.  No!  And what was her issue?  I don't know.  I mean, she tried to kill herself, obviously.  Yeah.  I guess it was some parental thing.  Was it real trying to kill?  No, no, no.  I think it was an attention thing.  I'm not a big fan of the attention.  Nah, I know.  You know, if you can do it, just do it.  Yeah.  Do it!  She was just one of those that was kind of...  You don't leave any time between doing it and being able to call everyone and wake 
[01:36:00]  them up from their nice night.  And say, I think I took too many pills.  Don't get started.  I'm not sure, but I think...  People hate me when I go down this road.  I might have...  I'm not a fan of me taking the pills, and then you call everyone you know, and horrifying  the shit out of them, and then we all have to drop everything we're doing to get to the  house immediately to, quote, save your life just in time.  Oh, boy.  Fuck!  Yeah.  I got a big fucking meeting tomorrow. 
[01:36:30]  I don't need this.  I don't know why.  I just...  I really just go for the batshit crazy girls.  Yeah.  What is that?  I don't think they're batshit crazy.  Batshit crazy!  I would have dropped the batshit part.  Crazy as a shithouse rat?  No.  Oh, by the way, I'm not looking for sympathy, because that's coming in now.  It was just my...  You know, it was part of my life.  I'm looking for sympathy.  I'm not.  It was part of my life.  What do you want? 
[01:37:00]  That's what we do.  We talk about it.  That's right.  Here on this program.  Uh...  No.  Ma...  No.  Uh...  No.  Holy shit, is that Phoebe Cates?  God damn!  That's Phoebe Cates?  What movie?  What movie is that?  Mr. Skin Rules.  This is called Private School from 1983.  Dude, that ass is exquisite in that photo.  That's got to be a stunt ass.  I don't...  Prove that it's actually Phoebe Cates' ass, because you can't really see her face in that shot.  Because she kind of looks like that with clothes on. 
[01:37:30]  Mm-hmm.  Let's say hi to Steve, who used to work in a mental hospital.  Steve.  Yes.  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I used to work in a mental hospital, and one time, the guy said he was Jesus, and he  was going on about being Jesus, and I said, well, I think everyone is God, and he never  said another word after that.  Yeah.  When you throw that Jesus word around, you'll get some things done in those situations. 
[01:38:00]  You're right.  Yeah.  I was friends with a guy...  I was friends with a guy...  He was driving me crazy all night, and I said, finally said it, and he shut up.  It was great.  I was friends with a guy named Carl, and he called it the Nervous Hospital.  The Nervous Hospital?  Yeah.  So I'm used to visiting him in the Nervous Hospital.  All right.  I got it.  That's a little slow.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Wee.  That is completely naked Phoebe Cates with a nice little bush in the front.  Look at that.  That's come back pre-shaving days.  It's 82. 
[01:38:30]  Damn.  You know what?  Man, the bush thing is...  Some girls wear it well.  You know what?  It's all right to see you every once in a while.  Something to be said.  You know what?  It's 82 picture of Phoebe Cates.  That's really her showing fucking funnel nudity like that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And under the water.  You know what?  I appreciate it.  Are you a fan of underwater nudity or not?  No.  I don't know where I stand.  It fucks bodies up.  I don't know where I stand on that one.  It makes tits look really funny.  The water pressure does something to them.  Yeah.  You get all weird.  I think I finally found out what the argument is for Bush on a girl. 
[01:39:00]  Because you know how I said, I like a girl.  With some hair there, just in the natural triangular shape, but groomed down very nicely.  And, you know, that to me is fine.  It's great.  From a bit of a distance.  Because if you're right up front there going down on a girl, that's when you like it nice and clean.  Like Jimmy always says, you know, clean as a whistle, no hair.  That's it.  But when you see a nude girl, I kind of like seeing a little triangle there. 
[01:39:30]  It just feels like more naughty or something.  Yeah, yeah.  And it kind of brings you right back.  Yeah.  If you saw a girl walking down that hall with a bush right now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You would lose your effing mind.  Exactly.  That would be hotter than just purely shaved if they're just kind of standing away from you.  Maybe this thing is turning around and we're heading back toward the Harry Bush.  The Harry Bush.  Because I'm starting to think about Harry Bush a little more lately.  I have been thinking of nothing else, Opie. 
[01:40:00]  Really?  Nothing else has been occupying my mind than our hair on a bush.  We got the really long hallway.  Girl, completely shaved.  Let me just look down so I can think about it.  Think about it.  All right, two girls.  How about we go with twins to make it very easy in our testing?  So you got twins.  You got one that's completely shaven.  Yeah.  And our twin sister has a full-grown bush.  Although, you know, you got to shave the fucking...  But it's not crazy.  You got to shave the thighs.  It's not crazy, Bush.  The upper thighs.  Let's get... 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  What are you thinking?  I'm totally for looking at the bush walking down.  Why are they closing the...  Because we're...  What, are people reading our lips?  No, no.  I might throw up a naughty photo or two, so...  Oh, I got you.  I don't feel like getting chastised.  How hysterical is it that...  Like, I thought we were closing them because we were talking about it.  This is why...  Holy shit.  This is why I hate, and this is a real statement that'll probably get me in trouble.  This is why I fucking hate working with broads. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  Because there's not a guy alive in this joint especially.  I'll just talk about this joint.  Yeah.  That is running to human resources because they walk by our studio and see Danny, like,  maybe popping a naked picture on the fucking screen.  Yeah.  No one's going to fucking lose...  No guy would lose him.  Oh, wait.  Go to...  Oh, Jesus.  See, now, that's a mess like that.  Yeah.  But if she cleaned that up and walked down the hall...  That looks like Tonya Harding.  It does a little bit.  Well, yeah, it looks like a few people. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  But she's got a nice body and shit.  But, like, walking down the hall...  Well, we can't even do the scenario because the curtains are closed, Ant, so...  Once they go down to the bottom...  Yeah, that one that the mouse is at.  No, over...  Yeah, there.  Let me see what that looks like.  Oh, that's one of those.  Yeah.  See, she's got, like, dirty blonde hair, I guess.  Yeah.  In both places.  But that's like...  That walking down the hall would be cool.  You want to see something, I think. 
[01:42:00]  No.  No.  Don't shave into funny things.  Don't put the friggin' thing...  There can't be a space, either, between the top of the actual vagina and where the hair  starts.  Where girls shave that and leave, like, this thing...  It looks like you left to tuff the hair between your belly button and your...  I also figured something else out.  The color of the hair.  Oh, look at that.  See?  Wow.  Ant.  The color of the hair is important down there.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I think if it's, like, a strawberry blonde or, like, a light brown... 
[01:42:30]  Yeah?  Like, I think it's got to be, like, dark.  It's got to be dark?  I think it's...  Yeah.  I don't know if it's got to be.  Because it didn't...  I don't...  There's something...  It really depends on how crazy it is.  If the hair color is not right, it kind of starts looking like a wound or something.  Like an animal wishing a wound.  An animal was shot or something.  It's just laying on the side of the road.  Whoa.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Road kill. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  We might have to bring back...  Like, that girl's very cute right there.  Pretty girl.  And she's showing, like, just...  There's too much hair.  Awfulness.  Yeah, it's horrendous.  She's showing awfulness down there.  That's horrendous.  She needs to be chopped in half.  Do girls shave their balloon knots?  I think some do.  Some bleach it.  Shave it.  Or did, like...  Wax it.  They do the Brazilian wax.  Ow.  Or did, like, time just take care of that?  Because you see some of these old pictures, like...  There's a lot of fucking hair and assholes.  Yeah, a lot of hair. 
[01:43:30]  I think we've evolved.  I think we've got...  Yeah, I think the women have evolved, and they just don't have to do that.  Look at that.  Right?  Would you do anything with that?  Like, you'd have to.  Like, all of a sudden, you're looking and just going, yeah.  The other thing...  All right.  The other thing...  The hair, like, above...  Yeah.  Like you're discussing, fine.  You know...  That's because if they're standing up, you don't see the hair below.  But when you've got the rim hair...  Yeah, where it's wringing the area, because the contrast of the pinkness...  Starts looking like a fucking sump or something. 
[01:44:00]  A sump?  With all the bushes around it?  A sump?  See, it grows nice in that area, people, because of all the shit that is feeding the...  Whoa!  The most...  Mike just fell out of the stand.  Feeding the weeds.  There's something to be said for standing bush.  What's with the red...  Let's see the red one up in the upper left.  That's what I'm getting at.  Red...  And see if that's...  Red bush hair.  That looks silly.  Red bush hair is rough. 
[01:44:30]  Let's see.  Real rough.  Oh, that's one of those that don't actually go to the picture?  No.  I hate those.  Hey, I'm starting to think we might have to bring back what's in your pants, because...  Guess what's in your pants, yeah.  Guess what's in your pants, because what happened with that game was every girl was the same  fucking thing, and we couldn't do the game anymore.  Wood floor, everything turned into wood floor.  I think the women are starting to go with a few different styles again.  Yeah.  I really believe that.  The game got boring, because it was always, well, wood floor, wood floor, wood floor. 
[01:45:00]  Right, we get it.  You shave your pussy.  Look at Becky in Wisconsin.  Becky.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, good morning.  Hey.  I just wanted to say that I got a Brazilian, and I regularly get a Brazilian, and my fiancee  wants it back, so I guess you guys are right.  Yeah, I think we might be turning this thing around slightly.  Yeah, we got to turn this around.  I think we might be moving back to the old days a little bit.  Yeah.  A little bit, a little bit.  Yeah, there you go.  So that's all I got.  Oh, there it is. 
[01:45:30]  Thank you, Becky.  See, the hair color, like, wouldn't you rather have that darker?  No, it fits fine.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  All right.  Look, it doesn't matter.  That fits fine.  It just makes it look rusty.  No, it suits her perfectly.  You know, you ever, like, I'm trying to think, you gotta, like, maybe like a, like a,  an old, rusty, leaky pipe where the rust is leaking as well?  You know what I mean?  Like that.  I never thought of it like that.  There's something.  If it's, if the hair color's not right down there. 
[01:46:00]  Drew.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  We're all over the place, which is fine.  What do you got for the show?  I think you're going to go backwards a little bit.  The, uh, the attention suicide attempt?  Yeah.  July 4th weekend.  Really?  Yeah, Sunday morning.  I can get the, uh, the call about six from the friend's mom who lives in Europe.  Then this happens.  Yeah.  Which also resulted in about 15 international phone calls.  Right.  I don't even know what my bill's going to look like. 
[01:46:30]  And then they, and then they got to really play into like, I just want to go.  I just want to go.  It's like, but you don't want to die because you're, you're calling me.  Yeah.  Because the people that really want to die, guess what?  Those are the people who, they don't have time to make any calls.  Oh, yeah.  They make up their mind.  I want to die.  Boom.  This is how I'm doing it.  Yeah.  We had a guy do that, uh, Santa Bragg, put the, uh, plastic bag over his head and  fly it off with a sweatshirt.  Yeah.  There you go.  We didn't find him until about four days later. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  There you go.  That guy isn't making any phone calls.  Hey, could you do that voice for me?  I love it.  With the whole pill thing.  How many pills?  How many, how many?  I love this one.  How many, how many pills did you take?  I don't know.  The bottle.  I, it's, I just thought there were a lot in there.  I can't really.  How many?  How many pills?  I'm sure I can't really.  How many pills?  Just tell me.  I can't tell.  There were.  Well, look at the bottle.  How many are left?  There's, there's five left. 
[01:47:30]  But I took a lot.  I think.  What's a lot?  What's a lot?  There's a couple on the floor.  I dropped some.  But I don't really.  I don't know.  Stop yelling at me.  Well, here's the worst thing.  Jesus.  She had, she had some of my pills.  Yeah.  That I gave to her with my name on them.  Because I gave them.  Well, I get prescription medications.  You know what I mean?  And, and so they're like, you know, it's just Tylenol and stuff like that, but it's still  got your name on it. 
[01:48:00]  Right.  That's something you don't want to have the cops finding.  Yeah.  I don't know.  But, uh, no, the whole time though, as I'm doing this, I kept thinking of the whole,  it's all about you.  The classic Opie line right there.  You know what?  People really get mad when I, but I'm just being honest.  I, I, I just hate them more than anything.  I hate it.  It's like, how much attention do you need?  Yeah.  You know, we all got lives with shit going on and we have to stop everything for your 
[01:48:30]  fake suicide.  And you set us into a complete panic and then you have to hear, well, they can't help themselves.  They're mentally ill.  They don't really know what they're doing.  All right.  And I know that's not a popular thing to say, but I, uh, let me go to sticker booger.  Sticker booger.  Oh, sticky booger.  Sticky booger.  Sticky booger.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, what's up?  Oh, hey.  Hey.  Hey, uh, my ex-old lady, she, she was a redhead and, uh, her bush looked like, you know how 
[01:49:00]  you leave a, a Brillo pad out by the sink, you go to grab it and it, and it squeezes  out and it's rusty.  Well, that's what it looked like.  See, I, I couldn't really explain it to Anthony, but I'm telling you the color has to be right  if the girl's growing in the hair down there, or it just looks like, like, yeah, like a rusty  Brillo pad, a leaky, rusty pipe.  There's just something going on.  That is terrible.  Well, uh, yeah, here you go.  Uh, we're, I'm finally on to it.  People are helping me out here. 
[01:49:30]  Jeff in Virginia.  Jeff.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Yeah.  A red bush is kind of like one of those old, musty, irony puddles at a construction site  with a oil slip on top.  Thank God I'm not the only one.  I just, I just couldn't describe it.  But if, if it's dark, if it's like a, kind of a, like a dark brown or leaning toward black,  it's all right.  There's a pond that's everywhere.  And yes, and you could go the other way, like a blonde, but that, that weird, like sandy 
[01:50:00]  brown, that dirty blonde, that reddish.  Yeah.  There's something about that that just takes you out of the moment a little bit.  There you go.  There you go, Ann.  A red bush looks like a puddle out of construction site.  That's a construction site.  Now we go to Madden, Morris County.  Danny, are you in?  Are you on board with this?  That is a blonde right there, right?  Well, it's, it said redhead, but.  I don't know. 
[01:50:30]  That's redhead.  Yeah, it's, it's reddish.  That's Eastside Dave Beard.  Eastside Dave.  That's definitely Eastside Dave Beard.  Yeah, it's just, uh.  I'm down with the redhead thing, sure.  I don't know what I'm trying to say, where it just looks messier or something.  Well, that would look messy any color right there.  That isn't groomed very well.  Yeah, you gotta, you gotta take some scissors to it every once in a while.  Trim that, trim that, fucking cowlick that's going on down there, and it might be okay.  There's a cowlick going on there.  It's fun to switch it up once in a while.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, if you're used to the same old thing. 
[01:51:00]  Switch it up.  Yeah, and then, you know, maybe shave completely, and then that's fun for a while, and then  grow it in, not, like, ridiculous, but, like, give it, like, a week and a half.  I gotta agree with Danny on this one.  And it's fun.  It's not, you know, once a girl decides to shave, that's all she ever does, is fanatically  shave it.  And occasionally, you do want to, you know, change it up.  Throw the fucking slider every so often.  A little slider action.  Yeah, you don't have to always have the fastball. 
[01:51:30]  Come on.  Let it grow for a weekend, a long weekend.  Yeah, yeah, give us something to look at.  Get it all porcupine-y.  Give us something to look at.  Barrett from Pittsburgh writes, does a redhead say, put it in my rusty, dirty shitter?  Oh, man.  There's a callback to yesterday.  Matt, what do you got?  Matt from Worth County.  Hey, right on.  What's up in Worth County today?  Hey, going back a few years, talking about your cry for attention for the suicide attempts.  I'm a cop.  I'm only on about a year or so. 
[01:52:00]  We get a call that a girl split her wrist with a razor.  So we go lights and sirens there, busting the door to whole work.  She's sitting up in a room with an electric razor rubbing her wrist.  For real.  Oh, God.  For real.  Yep.  Cry for help.  Yeah.  I mean, it's probably bad to make fun of the cry for help.  I would think.  Thank you, Matt.  But, you know.  Well, whatever.  I'm holding back.  Trust me.  Mike in Florida.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, how are you today, guys?  I was just listening to you guys talking about some red bush, and I've had a couple in my 
[01:52:30]  day.  Never go near them again.  They all stink.  The red bush stinks?  Yeah, not good.  Not good.  But I couldn't get under my fingernail.  I stuck it in a tomato juice, like, two days later, just to get the smell out from underneath  it.  That's just poor hygiene or something else.  He's saying the red bushes, though.  We should do an experiment.  Let's have E-Rock smell red bushes all morning.  Why should he have the...  You want to smell red bushes all morning?  Why should he have the duty of...  Would you smell red bushes all morning?  First of all, we'd never get one in here. 
[01:53:00]  But no, in my experience, believe me, I've had a lot worse experiences with dark hair  than with red hair, but I've been with more dark hair.  Well, that's because there's...  Well, that's because there's...  Law averages.  That's because there's duty stuck to their pubic hair.  Oh, my God.  That's why it's dark hair.  That's why.  Oh, wait.  I mean, all I have to say is that the strawberry bush and that red bush, I don't know, man.  And it wasn't a pleasant spell. 
[01:53:30]  And a couple of my friends had a couple of strawberry blonde redheads.  Same thing.  I don't know.  Maybe it's just coincidence, but I just stay awake for now.  Well, the famous stanky pussy story I tell from time to time, that girl actually had dark hair.  Yeah, dark hair.  Dark hair on that one because, you know, there was duty stuck to her pubic area.  I don't even want to think of that.  That's all horrid.  Thanks, guys, for the call.  I really appreciate you putting me on today.  No problem, Mike.  You helped the show.  I appreciate that. 
[01:54:00]  Let's go to Jim in Ohio.  Jim.  Hey, red pussy looks like an Irish setter's mouth.  Holy God.  These redheads are going to get mad.  Wow.  I'm just glad I'm not alone on this one.  There's just something about it.  All right.  Thank you.  I find it very hot.  Oh, wow.  You know what?  We might have to help Doug today.  This is an old bit, but I think we can do this for you today, Doug.  What do you got?  Hey, I've been hooking up with this girl for about a couple months now.  She's fully shaved. 
[01:54:30]  Her box is 100% fully shaved.  And just this past weekend, I realized, you know, I went down.  A long ass hair.  I'm like, what the fuck is that?  It's her ass.  Her ass is hairy as shit.  It's hairy as shit.  Wait, no, is it like the ass as we like, you know, the ass or is it the asshole?  Yeah, it was a couple.  It's the asshole.  The ass hair.  The ass-holery?  The hair was so long.  But the hole was so, the hair was so long, it creeped up.  Like when I was eating out of a box, it was fucking disgusting. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, my God.  What is this guy to do?  You're too scared to tell her?  I don't know how the hell to bring it up.  Like, dude, it's only been like three weeks, so I go, ah, because she's fully shaved.  I just don't think she knows.  Does she listen to the show?  What?  Does she listen to our show?  No, I hope not.  All right.  Well, fucking give us her number.  We'll call her and tell her for you.  Ah.  Yeah.  Nice.  I see.  Yeah.  Ah.  Yeah.  Ah. 
[01:55:30]  All right.  Thank you.  I don't think that's a good idea.  All right.  Thanks.  Bob Kelly's here.  We probably should break, even though the phones are really into this one.  Yeah.  Uh.  What are you showing me?  This is a girl who has flat pubes.  What does that mean?  Well, yeah, we'll go to it.  We'll let Greg in New York have the last word on this subject.  Greg, go ahead.  Hey, you guys are fucking old as shit.  This is not coming back. 
[01:56:00]  Old as shit.  He goes, this ain't coming back.  There's no fucking way.  I'm 22.  I'm out of a few girls and shit.  There's no way.  There was one girl.  No way.  It was disgusting.  Miss Harry Bush.  You hear this guy, one girl, and it was disgusting.  It was not.  It was just nobody knows of it.  Like, you know a girl with Harry Bush and everyone knows.  Like, stay away.  Look, I know we like to, you know, make believe we're pretty young on our show.  Let me tell you, let me tell you what we got when we were 22.  You're 22, right?  Yep. 
[01:56:30]  Dude, the bushes were so hairy, you couldn't find the fucking clit.  You had it, like.  You couldn't find shit.  You had to hack through it with your fingers.  Like, kind of pull it aside.  Right.  It was all over the place.  And if you got a bad one, it would smell like your grandma's closet.  It would be musky.  There would be a bit of musky to it.  I couldn't fucking do that.  No way.  You would fucking part that hair trying to find it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It would get confusing at times. 
[01:57:00]  And you didn't know any better, so you'd dig right in.  Only wacky porn stars were shaved back then.  And I was like, what is that?  What?  Who's shaving?  Next time.  And all of a sudden, you realize too late that you're eating out our dirty asshole  because you thought that was a pussy because it's all lost in there.  Oh, God.  I could imagine drinking and doing that shit.  You'd be fucking all fucked up.  Oh, you have respect for us, my brother.  We set the girls down this path years ago, man.  Oh, God. 
[01:57:30]  I'm out of here.  I've got to get to work.  All right.  Danny's punching up some really bad pictures.  The worst thing about this particular photo, aside from the obvious jokes everyone can make,  is that she has a happy trail that goes from just about her waist, I'd say,  up to about two inches under her chest.  It's a black girl.  Terrible egg tits.  Terrible egg tits with a huge bush.  She's got hair on her arms.  It's a hairy stomach.  She's got a hairy stomach.  If you didn't know any better, if you just isolated the stomach, you would say that's a guy's stomach, 
[01:58:00]  first of all.  That is a giant bush.  That's a real pick, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you remember the hairy bushes.  Not like that.  Why don't you tell the young guys out there what we had to deal with.  Yeah.  We did.  We dug right in.  I'll tell you, too.  We dug right in there.  Didn't even think twice.  It wasn't like you went, ew, what's going on?  You dove right in head first.  To that?  Not to that.  Not to that.  That is sticking out.  No, no.  That is down the thighs. 
[01:58:30]  Nothing worse than hair sticking out of the panty.  That is down the thighs.  And, dude, when you had one of these hairy bushes and the action was getting good and  everything was getting nice and wet, it's like your dog coming in from a rainstorm.  Oh, shit.  You know that smell?  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, it did kind of hold the liquid like a bounty.  Don't fucking tell us about your shaved pussies, you youngsters.  We've been through the, we've been through NOM.  Yeah. 
[01:59:00]  We were there before the Agent Orange.  That's right.  The defoliant.  That's right.  Fuckers.  God damn, man.  Keep your youth to yourself, fuckers.  All right, we got to take a break.  We got Bobo Loco, a grindhouse trailer that the boys made for us.  Bobo Loco, a grindhouse trailer.  And the phones are good.  We might go back to you guys if you want to hang through the break.  Robert Kelly will be in studio in minutes.  Brooke Hogan at nine.  Michael Emerson from Lost at 930.  That's definitely happening?  I hope so.  Because I think he canceled a couple times on us, didn't he? 
[01:59:30]  Well, he said he was sick.  Okay, so he's back today.  But first, Bobo Loco.  She was a prom queen who could have any guy she wanted.  He was a high school outcast looking for love.  Stay away from my girlfriend, punk.  No matter how hard he tried, she would never notice him until...  No, no, it's Bobo!  Bobo Loco action.  Stop it! 
[02:00:00]  Suspense.  Show me what it's all about.  The thrill ride of a lifetime.  Screaming for blood and looking for love.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  A man over the edge of insanity.  Bobo Loco.  I won't stop.  I won't stop. 
[02:00:30]  Fucking Bobby's opening line.  Why do you like...  What did you just say?  I came here...  I said, why do you have to like him so feminine?  Well, we're discussing Brooke Hogan.  She's gorgeous.  She's a big girl.  Yeah, I like that.  She's in proportion big, though.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that scares me a little bit.  So you said you kind of like the big back.  I like that big back.  And I go, of course you do.  And then what do you say to me?  Why do you have to like him so feminine?  He has a nice dirty knuckle. 
[02:01:00]  This is your song because of the white unicorn.  We're going to get into that in a second.  But first...  I sound excited about it.  Oh, yeah.  We got a great phone call from Donna that I got to get to.  And then we'll change subjects and get into what Bobby Kelly's into.  Also, Keith and Deer Park writes,  This made me laugh really hard.  Google bomb, duty pubes.  Duty pubes.  All right.  That's our Google bomb for the day.  Duty pubes.  Duty pubes.  All right.  And this guy...  Get to work, everybody.  Duty pubes. 
[02:01:30]  Pat the Trucker from Arkansas.  I know we're fucking around with the instant feedback.  I need one of the gentlemen from Arkansas.  The only guys I might say now is some dude from Arkansas.  Hey, Bob, I'm just kicking in.  This is going to be the best instant feedback of the day.  It just made us chuckle really, really, really hard.  And the key word in his instant feedback is hoped. 
[02:02:00]  Hoped.  He writes, Pat the Trucker writes, and going back to like...  We were discussing like...  We remember the days when the girls had just ridiculous over-the-top hairy bushes.  No one shaved.  And then it went down to...  We're going to trim it down a little bit.  Then we're going to shave the sides.  And now we're at a point where it's pretty much...  Nothing's happening, right?  Every girl shaves everything off.  I hate that.  But Anthony and I, we're sort of starting to think, eh, maybe we bring a little comeback.  A little comeback.  A little old school.  Nothing crazy.  Not all out craziness. 
[02:02:30]  No, no.  Just a little.  No.  I like the...  Can you break the banana off in pieces like every other guy does?  He shoved that thing right down his throat.  Let's just see if I was.  Let's see what I can do.  Oh, let's just see.  Let's just see if I was.  If you were, what you can do.  All right.  Let's see how good Bobby is.  You suck.  I suck.  You're not even a good homo.  To you, nobody is.  Jesus. 
[02:03:00]  Pat the Trucker writes, so we were talking about pubes.  Oh, my God.  He writes, and you hoped they wiped real good or it tasted like piss.  That's one for the old timers right there.  That's one of those little...  It's almost like a riddle you forget.  You don't even think that that even has play.  And then we go to Donna in Texas to wrap up the whole pube discussion.  Donna?  Yeah. 
[02:03:30]  What's up, Donna?  I got married in 1978, and my husband made me shave.  And, you know, I went ahead and shaved, and I made him go to the gynecologist with me  because I thought I was the only one in the world that shaved in 1978.  You probably were.  Yeah, you were...  I think so.  You were a shaving pioneer.  Ahead of your time.  Look at her.  Didn't even have the right razors.  You were...  I liked for him to go down on me, so whatever he wanted, I didn't care.  That was weird to ask a girl something like that back then. 
[02:04:00]  Could you shave off all your hair?  It's like, what are you, fucking pedo?  What's the matter?  You were scared that that hair was protecting something.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, there's hair there for a reason, goddammit.  Right.  Well, he was kind of freaky.  We're still married.  It's been a long time, and now I shave and I don't, and I shave and I don't, like what  y'all were talking about.  Wow.  And we've been, we're like in our, you know, 40s and 50s now, so now they're gray guys. 
[02:04:30]  Gray pubes?  Oh, wow.  Jesus Christ.  She's laughing like the shining woman in the tub.  The old lady.  Apparently she looks a lot like her.  Who doesn't like Donna?  Look at this one.  She's a wild one.  She has see-through pubes.  They have no color.  Like bullet bear fur.  Yeah, that'll make Bob puke.  Would that make you puke, Bob?  The gray pubes? 
[02:05:00]  No, gray, no.  I fantasize about old, old chicks all the time.  Do you?  Oh, yeah.  I love it.  That's a mother issue.  There's old, and then there's real.  It's a mother issue.  No, I fucking my mother issue.  I want to bang my mom?  Not necessarily that, but it's, there's a mother issue is why you would want to be with  an older boy.  If I wanted to bang my mom, I'd bang my mom when she was hot.  Not when she was 58.  Back when she was 20, she was smoking.  58 with a roid.  Who needs that shit?  Right, Bob?  When she has like five assholes. 
[02:05:30]  You know when they fold over and fold over?  All right, Donna, go take care of your pubes.  That's so funny, and I love you.  Oh, really?  What do you like about the show?  I'm going to bang my mom when she was hot.  She was just listening to the show.  Why not?  I'm going to get her.  She was great.  Why wouldn't she listen?  So, Bob, the white unicorn.  Yeah.  Yeah, Bob.  You were so excited to tweet that.  It's a scooter.  Is it really called the white unicorn?  No, I just, I don't know.  You think I'm CNN?  I don't know. 
[02:06:00]  I don't know, dude.  The minivans have fucked up names.  No, no, no.  It's, that's actually the newest, that's the 2010 Vespa 300 Supa.  How fast does it go?  About 90, 95 miles an hour?  Get the fuck out of here.  That's highway legal.  So, I swear to God, 300 cc's.  Highway legal.  If you were on a highway in that, I would fucking run you over with the escalator.  Yeah, we'd have to run you off the road.  I would have to run you off the road.  I've never seen a scooter on a highway, Bob.  I'm not saying people go on the highway, but you can, I can take that on the highway. 
[02:06:30]  Is that a selling point?  90 miles an hour, no problem.  Was that a selling point?  Because you'd got to be completely insane to go 90, 95 miles an hour on one of those things.  I could take that to Boston.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, that's why I got the little, uh, little hatchback.  Yeah, there's a little trunk in the back and everything.  Can I ask you something?  Yeah.  Why didn't you just get a fucking man's motorcycle?  Why didn't you just get a man's motorcycle?  Because that's hack.  How is that a hack?  I'm going to get on a...  Well, Travis on there doesn't look very good, but that's Danny's bike. 
[02:07:00]  That's Danny's ride.  What did that say?  Is that a 250 Rebel?  No, it's a V-Star 650.  It's a 650?  All right.  Why didn't you get a man's motorcycle?  Mine goes the same speed as that.  If you watch The Terminator, the first one, you'll see Sarah Connor riding to her job on exactly what you have.  It's the fucking chick machine.  The Terminator on a Harley.  Can we ask you why? 
[02:07:30]  The Terminator's the one on the real motorcycle.  I didn't see that movie.  You're Sarah Connor.  Bobby, why?  Why is it not a motorcycle?  Well, there's two...  Why did you get that?  Okay, there's two stories to it.  First of all, there's a sad story.  When I first got sober, I always wanted...  I've always wanted a moped.  A moped.  Yeah, I remember when I was...  The emphasis on mo.  When I was drinking and using drugs, I remember I stole a kid's moped once. 
[02:08:00]  I just took him off it and took it.  I just wanted one so bad.  Grand Theft Auto.  Right.  It was very much like that.  Throw him off it.  I stopped him at a light and I go, get off.  And he was like, why?  I'm just getting the bug off.  And I actually met that kid in English class in college years later.  Did he punch you?  No, he goes...  I go, hey, man, I know you.  He goes, I know you do.  Oh.  He still remembered me taking his...  Didn't like it either.  I gave it back.  It was just a little fucked up.  It was a ticket for a ride.  Couldn't ride it. 
[02:08:30]  So when I got sober, I worked at a styrofoam factory for like six months.  I had a retard as my boss.  We were making styrofoam balls.  We'd make a half ball and a half ball and then some Mexican lady would glue them together.  It was me, a retarded guy, a Mexican lady, and an old Jewish boss.  What a career.  Goldstein.  Do you ever wonder when one of those people describe who they work with, what you are?  Well, there was a retarded guy, an old guy, a bag.  And this retarded Mexican guy. 
[02:09:00]  Why do you make balls in half, though?  Christmas ornaments.  That's how they make them.  I had a retarded guy.  You're making the ball.  You're going to put it in the machine.  And no, but no, you're doing it wrong.  He would yell at me.  It's probably very difficult to make a sphere without being too half.  I had a retard boss, too.  Did you?  One day when I was temping, I had to wash dishes, and guess who was in charge of the kitchen?  They're smart as hell.  Oh, yeah.  It was a lot of fun.  They have to be.  You yelled that by, you know.  You're saying retards are smart as hell.  Well, it is. 
[02:09:30]  They have to be.  They are if all they have to think about is one thing every day.  Yeah.  If you had one thing to think about all day, yes.  All right.  You got a point.  You make them mad.  If your whole existence is how to make the stupid ball, yeah, you're pretty fucking smart.  Point well taken.  Point well taken.  He practiced that for like eight years.  He was practicing that.  And he.  Did you ever have a retard boss in it?  No.  Well, some that I thought were retarded, but never actually did. 
[02:10:00]  Is it still safe to say retard, or are they taking that one away?  They took it away.  They actually.  M.R.  Yeah.  And one of the bills.  The health care bill.  The health care bill.  They had the word retard, retarded in there.  And they caught a lot of flack.  And then.  And then Obama caught some crap when he said that he bowled like a retard.  And he had to apologize for that because it's mentally disabled.  Mentally retarded.  It's M.R.  Mentally retarded.  They call them M.R.  No, they don't call them M.R.  No, they do.  No, they don't.  Absolutely.  No, they don't. 
[02:10:30]  No, they don't.  Oh, no.  Oh, they took the.  I know.  When I used to work.  You can't say retard.  I lived with six retards in college.  I like they gave me a free apartment.  I think retard's fine.  Oh, they're the retards are the best human beings on the field.  My best friends I've ever had.  It's not derogatory.  I used to throw.  I used to have a motorcycle, a 500 shadow.  I used to throw them on the back.  Don't try to man yourself up now.  It was a 500 shadow.  It's the same thing.  Just had wings on the tank.  That's about it.  And he gave them rides.  I used to put the helmet on, but it didn't fit his head.  The hash shell.  It didn't fit. 
[02:11:00]  It would just sit on top of his head.  And I'd drive him around town and he'd be holding my waist.  And he'd just be licking his tongue.  Of course.  I'm just flapping out of his mouth.  It was probably the best day of his life.  Dude, I used to love it.  You think Obama, you know, his apology, was he sincere, you think, when he had an apology?  Of course not.  If he uses the word retard, he uses the word retard.  Right.  He's probably, you know how you are with kids?  Like, he's probably got his kids there at the White House. 
[02:11:30]  And he's probably like, stop being retarded.  Like, every father would be like that.  He's a dad.  Of course.  So he probably says that.  All right.  Bob retards.  So the guy's licking and you're giving him a ride.  I am.  Didn't give you a reach around while you were driving?  I used to hold my stomach.  Hold on.  He actually, I used to catch him jerking off to me all the time.  Because they don't have sexual, they don't know gay.  Here's Bob's, I love Bob's logic.  They don't know gay.  Retards don't know gay.  They don't know sexuality.  I do.  It's seated to my right. 
[02:12:00]  Let it be known, Bob Kelly is sitting in case he's right.  I just did a visual.  Maybe I should have said.  But, yeah, they just fucking, they see something hot.  And that's when I was hot.  That's when I had the long curls and the abs.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We all know those pictures.  The Rico Suave hair.  You hear how he does this?  Like, he really wants us to go, really, Bob?  Tell us more about how hot you are.  Guarantee you Google me later. 
[02:12:30]  Guarantee you.  I remember you with hair.  Google you.  Yeah.  I remember you with hair.  Oh, yeah?  And you were probably even thinner than you are now.  And you're back in, you know, fighting shape.  I was gorgeous back then.  But, yeah, he used to jerk off.  I used to hear, bam, bam.  And then I'd go into his room and just be, his knees up to his chest.  Just cranking one out.  Just, like, on his side.  Bam, bam.  And I'd be, what are you doing?  Get out of here.  Cranking him out.  But you're convinced they don't know. 
[02:13:00]  What did you say?  They don't know.  They don't know gay.  They just know what's hot.  And I was hot back then, so.  So you're saying that.  Yeah.  Looking at you, to them, was the same as looking at a hot chick.  Fuck, I used to walk around in bikini underwear.  I wouldn't even doubt it.  Oh, yeah, I did.  I'm not even kidding.  I'm not kidding that.  I think you're kidding.  They would mimic, like, what you do, if you like it.  So when they got their clothing vouchers, after, like, a month or so after I lived there,  they all came back with bikini underwear. 
[02:13:30]  Like, and that's back when Pastels were in Miami Vice.  Let me tell you how, and it didn't fit them, because they had those giant retard cocks.  It was just up there, assholes, and one nut hanging out, and just a big helmet bulging  through the bikini.  It was awful.  It was awful.  Fucking fuck.  Holy shit, one nut hanging out, yeah.  You can just see a little bit of pink, like, right above the top of their legs.  That's all you can see of the underwear. 
[02:14:00]  Too stupid to wear bikinis.  Oh, my God.  Underwear.  Classic.  But anyways, I got a, when I worked at this retail, in school, I went to school for a couple  classes, and then I would go home.  They would let me go work, because I just got out of Juve Hall and all in rehab and all  that, so I didn't have to go to full classes.  So I'd work, I'd go to class, I'd do two classes, leave around 10.  Go to this styrofoam factory and make styrofoam balls.  And, uh...  What a life.  I was...  It was... 
[02:14:30]  Now, look, you're torn all over the place, and you were a fucking retard making styrofoam  balls.  I was definitely a retard making styrofoam balls.  Unbelievable.  And, uh...  I saved all my money to buy a moped.  I was a year sober?  Under a year?  Or over...  No, a year and a little bit over, because I was in a rehab for a whole year.  So it was a little over a year.  You went to rehab for a year?  I went away.  I was away for a year.  I couldn't see chicks, family.  I was in a house with 24 other kids from 9 to 18 for a year. 
[02:15:00]  That's where it happened, right?  What?  No.  I would have took it.  Believe me, I didn't get anything.  I would have took it.  There was one priest.  I remember this priest.  He was really...  Oh, God.  Here we go.  He was really fat, and he had, like, fang teeth, and just a pimply face.  Ow.  You know what blows me away is that I've met a bunch of these...  A priest?  I met a bunch of these priests over my...  And they're just like,  Hi, Robert. 
[02:15:30]  What's going on?  And nobody says...  Are you a fang?  Nobody.  Who would...  I mean, he was the gayest human being I've ever met.  One of them.  Really?  Just, Hi, Robert.  Welcome to rehab.  Okay.  It seems odd that you would take just a vow of celibacy, if you're a man, for any reason.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, you get a calling.  Yeah, that one's weird.  Yeah, it just is a little odd.  Yeah, because you just...  Because we have to get the poison out.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It's got to get out.  We're just constantly fucking making poison. 
[02:16:00]  That's the rehab where I got caught jerking a fuck in the sink.  Fuck in the sink, right.  The famous sink story.  Sonny in Boston.  Sonny.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, guys.  You know, Bobby's kind of right.  Yeah, retarded people don't know gay.  Growing up, I still...  He's still alive today, but I got this retarded uncle.  And while I was growing up, this retarded uncle of mine used to chase me around the house  until he caught me.  And he used to dry hunt me all the time.  And my grandmother would just sit there and just kind of like laugh and say, hey, he's  just playing.  Holy Jesus. 
[02:16:30]  He's just playing.  He's like an English bulldog.  It just wasn't me.  It was all my cousins, too.  So it just isn't a fucking, like, recluse memory of mine.  It's like he did this all the time to us fucking grandchildren.  I fucking hated it.  There was some retarded kids, like, years ago when retarded kids were, like, really retarded.  Now, I don't know.  They were able to kind of detect it in the womb.  So you don't get as many retards.  And they did seem very overly sexual. 
[02:17:00]  Like, they'd be rubbing themselves and shit like that.  I think they just don't know...  It's not that they don't know gay from this.  They're just over-sexed.  They were back then.  They're just cavemen.  Yeah, it's like a caveman attitude.  They don't know gay is bad.  They don't know...  They just know that they get horny.  Gay is bad?  Yeah, they don't think...  What do you mean?  They don't think...  What are you saying?  To our society...  To our society...  Now you say bad.  Seriously, to our society, guys are like, dude, what are you, a fag? 
[02:17:30]  Don't be a fag, faggot, homo.  But that's more just...  Gay is a fucking...  You know, I mean, I'm not saying that.  I don't give a shit at all.  But I'm saying that gay people aren't subjected to that.  They're retarded.  They're just dealing with being a retard.  Nobody's like, dude, don't be a fag.  They're hanging out with other retards.  They don't know that gay is bad.  They just...  But when you say, don't be a fag, you're not saying that as a gay, derogatory gay term to your friend.  You're just saying, don't be a fag, you know?  You mean, come on out.  What are you doing?  You know?  So...  Growing up, dude, being, you know, what are you, gay? 
[02:18:00]  What are you, fag?  What are you, a sissy boy?  I mean, that was exactly why he used it.  I remember...  Someone spread it out.  It was always a derogatory term, but it was...  Yeah, I didn't.  Oh, dude, when I was...  I didn't...  Yeah, Brooke's already...  I didn't...  Yeah, I never understood.  I just thought, you know, don't be a fag.  The whole family still calls my uncle a fucking retard, so...  Fucking retard.  Did he ever put it in?  No.  No, it wasn't that bad. 
[02:18:30]  Did he get the tip in?  Did you ever put that huge helmet in your mouth?  Thinking...  Okay, listen, I'd punch out...  Thinking it was a bottle?  Oh, shit.  Oh, right.  Yeah, I remember reading this, the email.  She's on a very tight schedule.  Let's get that Brooke in here, man.  Okay.  Bring in Brooke.  You know Brooke Hogan there, Bobby?  I met her once.  She's actually...  Very, very nice. 
[02:19:00]  All right.  Yeah, right, get in here.  Come on.  What are you waiting for?  Is it like 90 people?  I know, it's an entourage.  Hi, Brooke.  I'm back.  Brooke Hogan is back.  I guess we did okay by you.  Yeah.  Hope so.  You guys didn't turn me off.  No.  Good.  Little Jimmy Norton isn't here today.  Oh, no.  So standing in is Robert Kelly.  And he's gay, so don't worry about him.  Well, I'm married and gay.  He's married and gay.  I have a Vespa. 
[02:19:30]  Are you married to a man?  No, I'm married to a woman, but I have a Vespa, so they're calling me gay.  Do you know what a Vespa is?  Yeah, I have a Vespa.  You do?  Yeah, but you live in, where are you living now?  Pink.  A pink Vespa?  Yeah.  But see, because a lot of people are getting mad, see, Bobby?  I have the white unicorn.  But we're talking, you shouldn't be driving one of those in New York City.  It's not like blue or green or anything?  No, there it is right there.  It's a hot one, huh?  It's very fresh.  It's very fresh.  I was just saying, if you're a guy, why wouldn't you, how much about ballpark would that run? 
[02:20:00]  That's brand new, 2010, 675.  Yeah?  You could buy a really nice real man's motorcycle, though.  Yeah, you know, you understand, I bought it, you understand, it's from my wife, too.  She wants to use it while I'm away.  Oh, okay.  So she wanted one, she wanted like a pink 150, hey, I'll just cruise around.  I was like, well, fuck it, get a big one so I can...  Don't try to man it up.  Oh, wait, now you're saying you bought it for her?  My dad and his girlfriend... 
[02:20:30]  If you're going to get real in front of Brooke, I mean...  Hulk didn't get one, right?  My dad and his girlfriend have scooters, but they're not Vespas.  Vespas go kind of into that, like, Milan, like, French Pilly kind of thing.  Oh, man.  See, he didn't get the cool one.  No, this is the...  Like, he's got these other ones that are like, um...  They look like little baby motorcycles, kind of.  Yeah, I've seen those.  And they're black.  Those are all right.  And they're fast as hell.  Yeah, yeah, you can really screw yourself up on those.  Yeah.  I've seen those miniature motorcycles. 
[02:21:00]  How is the pops doing?  He's doing good.  Yeah?  Wait, the divorce went through yesterday, right?  Yeah.  It's all over the place, and now we have you in today.  You all right with that?  Yeah.  Are you happy that it's finally over with?  Yeah, thank God.  It needed to be over.  It was lasting way too long.  I actually didn't think it was going to end this fast.  A month ago, I was still talking to my dad, and he's like, man, I don't think this is  going to end anytime soon.  And then, poof.  Can I tell you something?  How long were they going through it?  A year?  Two years.  Two years?  Yeah.  See, I bring it up because our pal Ant here went a lot longer than that. 
[02:21:30]  About three?  Oh, my God.  Three.  And still dealing with it.  He really can't talk about it too much.  Well, yeah.  And that was, you know...  The marriage has been over about, I don't know, about 10 years, and he's still dealing with  it, basically.  Oh, my God.  No kids, no nothing.  They didn't own nothing.  Yeah, look at her giving you the look.  Yeah, exactly.  I got my lawyer out of, like, Craigslist.  Maybe that's why it lasted three years.  Exactly.  I probably had the shittiest lawyer ever for a divorce.  Oh, no.  That's not good. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I tried to, you know, save a little money, and it wound up really costing me a lot.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, terrible.  Were you hoping they were going to get back together, or you're way past that?  No, they...  You think she's five?  Sorry.  No, I don't...  I don't know.  No, they just...  They don't get along.  It's more miserable seeing them together.  Yeah.  It's really...  Do they hang out?  Do they blame the kids?  No.  I'm just kidding, because that's the thing.  When my parents got divorced, like, my mom brought us in and stuff like that and said,  I just want you kids to know it has nothing to do with you. 
[02:22:30]  It's not your fault.  And all I thought was, it's totally our fault, and that's why she's saying it.  Like, if she left it alone and never said that, I never would have thought that.  Right.  But at the time, I'm just like, oh, my God, she's saying this because it's totally our fault.  Yeah.  And...  No.  My mom was divorcing my second stepdad, and he used to beat me and everything.  And then he came home...  Is that why you got the best butt?  Yeah.  No, that's why...  Beat you with a best butt.  That's why I jerked off my friend.  Oh, Jesus.  I...  He came home...  He was an abusive guy, but he came home with Atari when Atari first came out and bribed us, 
[02:23:00]  and it worked.  We were like, Ma, can you just stay with him?  Really?  Yeah.  And then she came home and took the Atari.  We were like, fuck you.  You're a bitch.  We were mad at her because she took away the Atari.  And he turned out to be just an evil dude.  Oh, he was an evil guy, yeah.  You know, Brooke is here because she has an album.  Yeah, the Redemption.  Yeah.  Yes.  I want...  I just want to say one thing.  When you and your dad...  That's more than one.  Oh, yeah.  When you and your dad took the boat ride past your house and your dog was on the train... 
[02:23:30]  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  We watched that.  Did it make you cry?  Did you want to get a Vespa?  You want to...  I got a bit teary-eyed.  A bit teary-eyed because the Hulk's crying.  When the Hulk cries, you're like, fuck, all right, I can cry too.  Yeah.  You'll feel every Hulk-a-maniac around the world crying.  Yeah, but the dogs were like, that's what killed you, too.  Did you see it?  Yeah.  You saw the clip, too?  The dogs were just like...  The little tiny dogs were running around trying to...  Yeah.  The water was separating them.  Because they don't know anything.  I haven't been that emotional in a long time, and it's just like, you know, your dogs... 
[02:24:00]  I think the thing that made me so emotional was, you know, I haven't seen...  Our family was really so torn apart, and dogs, when they remember you, it's like they don't  know anything else.  They don't know what a divorce is.  They don't know, you know, happy, sad, whatever, but they remember you, and then when they see  you, they want to go to you.  Right.  And they, like, miss you, like, at that moment, even if, like, five seconds later, they  don't miss you.  At that moment, they see you.  Yeah.  And they're like, oh, my God, it's Brooke, it's Brooke.  You know, I'm thinking, like, what their little brains must be thinking, and they're standing 
[02:24:30]  there, like, if they could have jumped off, just the innocence of, like, little dogs just  being there, and if they could have just jumped off the dock to get to me, I know they would  have.  Yeah.  And then Hulk going, oh, I can't go over there.  Yeah.  And he had to look away, and it was just like, you know, that was the highlight of your show  this year.  That was the highlight right there.  That was the highlight moment, and I was really just, like, I was actually in a good mood  that whole day, and I was fine, and, you know, we, sorry, I just got, like, a really bad  visual on that TV for a second.  I was like, wow.  I don't know. 
[02:25:00]  It was, like, some girl laying there dead or something.  I don't know.  Yeah.  We get distracted.  That's just Maury.  It's just Maury.  Maury doing his thing.  Maury Povich.  Yeah, I was in a fine mood, and then, like, when we went there, and I really hadn't been home  in so long, and I hadn't seen my dogs in so long, and I couldn't get to them.  I was like, oh, my God, because I really can't go see them, you know?  I mean, it's not like my mom put in a restraining order, but, I mean, Charlie being there itself  is intimidating and weird.  You still hate Charlie, huh?  I hate him.  But you like your...  I don't hate him because of his age. 
[02:25:30]  I hate him because, first, I think he's a...  My personal opinion of him is that he's a total tool, but, second of all, he tried to get  my dad put in jail by filing false motions.  I'm like, okay, you're a liar, and you're, you know...  Mm-hmm.  Right.  Oh, God.  Was that the mother's boyfriend?  The young kid?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But then the Hulk's got a new girlfriend, and the other thing that I liked about your  show this year was where your dad forced you to go out to kind of get to know his new 
[02:26:00]  girlfriend, and he was all excited about, you know, I think, Brooke, I think you're really  going to like her, and he was all excited and really into it, and then he went to the  bathroom so these two could talk.  Uh-oh.  And it was filmed perfectly.  You guys were just sitting there like, uh...  Oh, what are we talking about?  No, she's actually...  I'm sure it's turned around since then, but...  It's...  We're so cool, and I really...  I love her to death.  Like, she's super...  She's just awesome, but at that time, it's like we'd only known each other for a day,  and I'm like, okay, here's this girl, you know, from Florida, just coming in here, and 
[02:26:30]  you know, whatever.  She's blonde.  She's got big boobs.  I'm like, what else am I supposed to think?  I'm like, whatever.  I mean, I do, but I've been in the family for a while, so it's acceptable.  You know, but I was like, I don't know, but she ended up really just being a sweetheart,  and she's very genuine, and she's like an honest, nice person, so...  Yeah.  Your dad's happier?  Yeah.  You know, it killed me to see Hulk in the smaller house, too.  I know.  What the fuck is that?  Because the whole episode was just...  It's just like such an ego crush for a man.  It's like... 
[02:27:00]  He looked like he was in a really nice grandma house.  He's the one that took the bumps.  He's the one that...  Right.  You know, he's the one that should be in the big house.  They had a sweet piece of property when they were all together, and now Hulk's in the  smaller house as he's...  And that other kid...  The other kid gets to live there, right?  Her boyfriend, the young kid...  How do you deal...  And my dad's been so humble about it, too.  Like, I can't believe it if I worked that hard, and I had some little kid just walking  in there and being like, hey...  Oh, my God.  I don't know how you deal with that.  I'd be like, yeah, get me on the phone with OJ, brother. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  Remember that?  He got in trouble for saying that with the OJ thing?  Just mentioning OJ.  Like, he's like, I understood why the guy went crazy, but I would never do that.  Yeah.  And then people instantly think...  Oh, he's OJ.  Why does everyone get so...  Why does everyone get so freaked out when you say you can understand that much anger?  That mindset.  And that frustration.  But you'd never do it.  Right.  But I understand how being fucked over to that extent, you could get angry.  Yeah. 
[02:28:00]  I mean, and it's just...  You know, I'm still old school in my mindset of men and women and, you know, whatever.  And I think a man, you know, is allowed to have a little bit of an ego and be proud of  the things that he's, you know, tamed and worked hard for and stuff.  Like a Vespa.  It's really like a Vespa.  Thank you.  It's just really a shot.  It's just really a shot to the heart, though.  It's like this big house that he built and his family and all of this stuff that he was  so proud of just to be like, have the carpet pulled out from under him by like a 19-year-old  kid and just like, screw you, dude. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, that's got to be pure anger.  And he just really maintained his...  Will he ever get that house back?  Or is that gone?  I think he actually...  I think it's just...  My mom is moving out of it and moving to California with Charlie.  And the house is just going to sit there.  I think my dad is in charge of like being able to sell it or whatever, but...  Oh, they have to sell it and then split the...  They don't have to, but I think it's just...  Not too many memories, probably.  All I know is that it's just sitting there and I know my dad doesn't want to go back there.  I know I don't.  Really?  Nobody really wants to go back there.  That's a great...  I'll buy it. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  How much do you ask?  How much?  That's a great house.  Right now with the economy, you get that sucker for $600,000.  Are you going to have another season?  Of the TV show?  Yeah, I hope so.  I really hope so.  We finished filming the second one and we're just waiting to hear from the heads of VH1.  Right.  To see how this one did.  Cool.  The ratings were good, right?  Oh, I'm sure they'll pick it up.  They'll pick it up.  It's doing great.  So the album's called The Redemption.  And you just think about your mom on here, I believe, right?  Yeah.  One of the songs I was reading?  I have one.  Dear Mom.  It's just called Dear Mom? 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  It was right after that quote came out where she said that if Charlie put out a record, it would  do better than mine.  Oof.  Why would you go down that road?  It really hurt me.  I don't really know her.  We met her a couple times.  She seems, I don't know, like she wouldn't.  Yeah, buy what you want.  That's confusing.  Why?  Why is she taking shots at her own daughter?  She's got a different side.  Apparently.  But whatever.  Yeah.  So I wrote that song.  I was really upset and I was just like, I have to get this out.  What do you write about in that song?  Just the manipulation and stuff that occurred and the backstabbing of like, you know, it's 
[02:30:00]  just stuff that I just don't understand how you could pick.  And I would never ask her to pick anybody, you know, just because I love her.  I would never want her to pick, you know, her lover over her kids or whatever, just because  I want her to be happy.  But, you know, when she really is like putting that before her children and before her family  and why does she like Charlie so much that she's blowing off her own kids?  I don't know. 
[02:30:30]  For real.  It's no sense.  For real.  Why?  How old is Charlie?  He's 20 something, right?  20.  Just 2-0?  2-0.  Wow.  I'm 21.  Holy shit.  You can't say anything.  I know I can't say anything.  Why can't you say anything?  You dating a 5-year-old or a best son?  Oh, a best son.  Ed, maybe a few years.  No.  A few years.  Ed, a few years.  You know how us showbiz people are. 
[02:31:00]  Uh-oh.  Mom dating a 20.  I don't know.  It just sounds.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's different.  It's different with a woman.  I think it is different.  There's a double standard, definitely.  If a woman who was married and gets divorced and then shacks up with a 20-year-old,  a guy, that seems weirder than a guy, an older guy going out with a younger girl.  Like I said, I'm old school with how I think.  I think women are more mature than, you know. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  Men.  Yeah, you could say that.  You know, at certain ages.  So I just feel like a woman who's a mother and who's a responsible adult shouldn't be dating  a kid who's, you know, still interested in skateboarding and still a 15-year-old.  Yeah, yeah.  A woman, though, is more mature.  And I feel like, you know, my dad's dating somebody who's 20 years younger than him.  But she's 35.  Yeah, I was going to say that.  You know, so she's already grown.  Like, she's already in that mindset.  It's like, I think it's just, you just don't date a child.  Your mom is a real pretty woman, and she's been a mom for a long time. 
[02:32:00]  Your dad's been in the limelight, been out there.  And he probably never, you know, your dad seems like a solid guy.  But, you know, you're in show business, you flirt, you're out there getting all the accolades.  And all of a sudden, she's in the limelight.  Some people can't handle that, man.  And then she's divorced.  I mean, why not?  Why not go relive some of the stuff you missed?  I don't know, but why not go and just date Richard Gere or something?  Because I'll tell you why.  It's easier to control somebody who's 20 than it is to go with a guy who's going to have a responsibility, a mature, he's going to want, you know. 
[02:32:30]  Who won't be bowing down to her.  Yeah, I mean, it's like having a little poodle.  So she likes a little dog, you know.  She could have went young, but she went real young.  Because isn't your mom about the same age as your dad?  It's one thing to be like Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher where it's like, I don't know, how old is Ashton Kutcher?  Like 30 or something like that.  If the guy was 30, I'd be like, all right, whatever.  Your mom's got to be 50, right?  But when the guy's like my brother's age, I'm like, I think it's just.  It's like, I think it's just like when the guy's my brother's age, it's just kind of like. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, but she can control him, though.  He's a kept man.  He's, you know, no.  I mean, he gets.  Like, I know if I have a son.  Yeah.  I'm going to, like, I can't even, I wouldn't even be able to picture my son having sex, let alone having sex with somebody his own age.  Like, that'd just be like, oh, my God, it's a baby.  Like, right?  To you, if you're a parent?  So, if Charlie was older, you wouldn't have as much of a problem, probably?  Well, no.  I can't even get past the age.  Or if he was more mature.  More mature.  Not even that.  I mean, I don't think it's right, but I'm not, you know, nailing her to the cross because of the age. 
[02:33:30]  And I'm pissed because he's trying to put my dad in jail.  Yeah.  And he's just a user and a tool.  And I'm mad at her because I can't believe she can't see through it.  Why is he trying to, how is he trying to put your dad in jail?  What is he doing?  He was, I don't even know if I'm supposed to talk about this, but he was filing false motions against my dad.  Like, saying, oh, Hulk's following me.  So, then he'd file a motion or whatever.  Oh, jeez.  So, that if he even saw my dad down the street, he could be like, oh, Hulk's following me again, and then my dad would get put in jail. 
[02:34:00]  You know, like.  So, your dad obviously wasn't following Charlie.  No.  Right.  One day he said that I was in the car with my dad, and we saw them at a red light, and we just went past.  Right.  You know.  What are the odds of that?  We live in a very small town.  Yeah.  We, like, my dad and my mom, this past two years, to be in Clearwater for the divorce, they lived within, like, a quarter mile of each other.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That's not good. 
[02:34:30]  How did Hulk not punch this guy in the face?  I know.  What restraint.  For real.  What restraint on the part.  For real.  Just got out Hulk Hogan.  Pick this car up like a Mentos ad.  There have been times.  I actually, I ran into Charlie at the big house before all this stuff went down, and he was hiding in my brother's bathroom.  I think I told you guys that story.  Yeah, absolutely.  You can't fault him for that.  And I'm a woman, and I've never been aggressive.  I'm, like, super chill.  I never get mad.  But it took all the strength of me to not want to knock that kid out. 
[02:35:00]  Just his attitude when you see him.  He's just like, uh.  Most guys would hide.  Oh, yeah.  Hide in that scenario.  I'd be trying to make my shoes look like the mom's shoes in the closet.  Oh, in the closet with all the clothes around you.  Oh, my God.  I'm not in here.  Holding my breath like an Indian.  He's got to be insane to be even taking a chance with Hulk like that.  You could, I mean, yeah, you'd kill somebody.  He's tall.  He's tall.  He's, like, 6'2 or something, but he's skinny.  Yeah, but he's skinny.  He's literally, like, my pinky.  Right.  I'll pull that leg drop on him. 
[02:35:30]  So it's a good day for Hulk to, you know, his divorce is over.  He can move on.  Yeah, I think it's sad in some ways for him, but I think at the same time, I think he's relieved.  You know what she's going to, like, that relationship's going to be just whatever, and then she's going to probably come back or try to, and then what?  Then what happens?  Oh, when her regrets start popping in her head, and she realizes, you can see this playing out.  This kind isn't good.  Does he have a job, the young guy?  Does he work?  Like at Subway or something?  He rents jet skis out to tourists on the beach. 
[02:36:00]  I swear to God.  So he adds, like, $150 a month into the account?  Yeah.  That's hysterical.  Come on.  I swear to God.  Jet skis.  Yeah, he works for the jet ski rental people on Clearwater Beach.  That's something.  Yeah.  He doesn't own the company.  I don't think he works there anymore, though.  I think he got fired for something bad that I don't know if I'm allowed to say.  Well, the divorce is over.  I think he got busted for having something on him.  Oh. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  A little drug action.  I would think, I'm going to go Coke.  Yeah, that's what I'm going to go.  Coke, right?  Florida, him.  Florida is a big Coke state, isn't it?  That's what I'm saying.  It certainly is.  That's what I've come to find out.  A lot of people in Florida have that.  I'm like, oh my God, I've never seen so much of my life.  She's got a good poker face.  I said Coke, she didn't move.  No, I don't.  No, I don't even go there.  You don't know for real?  I don't even go there.  But you know he had something on him, possibly.  Oh, you mean with Charlie.  I thought you were like, oh, no, me.  I'm like, no.  No, we all know you do Coke.  No, no, Charlie.  No. 
[02:37:00]  No, Charlie had, was it Coke is what I'm saying.  I can't, I really honestly can't be specific.  I'd like to.  I just don't know where my like treading grounds are, but it was bad.  If it's Coke, blink.  No, just go.  Like that.  Leave her alone.  She's been cooler.  I know.  Redemption is going to do very well, obviously.  Thank you.  You do any live gigs?  Yeah, actually.  I just did one in Miami.  I'm actually getting ready to do another one in Miami on the 31st at Mansion down there. 
[02:37:30]  And then I have one, I think, coming up here in New York.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Yeah, New York.  And yeah, I have some stuff coming up.  It's basically every weekend I'm working.  I'm doing a show.  Is it, how do you like doing live shows?  I love it.  Oh, my God.  I live for it.  I love it.  Really?  I really love it.  Cool.  I can't wait to start working with my band again, too.  Right now, I'm with my dancers, and we're doing track shows and stuff.  You look distracted today.  No, you know what it is? 
[02:38:00]  I'm trying not to cough.  I had a cold, and it's starting to go away.  Right here, right?  Right in here?  It's like right in that pocket.  I can't laugh today because of that.  Yeah.  And then I'm trying, like, the other people said that, too.  They're like, you're very subdued today.  I'm like, no, I just, I'm trying to.  Well, because the whole divorce thing went down.  I mean, that's got to be, you know, it's got to be emotionally draining.  It's safe to say.  Can I see the back of that?  Is that?  You got to, your picture's over there.  No, no, no, no.  The back one.  No, the other one.  What are you talking about?  That one right there.  No, the other picture. 
[02:38:30]  Here.  There's only three.  There's only three, and he's changed it three times.  That I just threw to Bob.  Wow.  It's the cover.  Yeah, no, right here.  Okay.  I'm looking at that.  Nice, right?  Just shredded, yeah.  No, yeah, no, I know.  I'm like, I looked, the artist did it, and I was like, wow, you really gave me something  to really live up to, huh?  I'm like, crap, I'm going to have to be a bodybuilder after this cover.  No, I just, he is just a really beautiful artist, and I just told him, or he does beautiful  work. 
[02:39:00]  He's a great artist.  And he, I just was like, you know what, do your thing, just make it look heavenly.  So, he's a master at doing bodies and stuff like that, too, though.  So, he actually, believe it or not, though, he actually did take my body, I think he just  contoured it a little bit.  Because those are my hips, and that's my little pudgy stomach right there.  Pudgy stomach.  Yeah, you're a pudgy.  My bicep, I don't think, looks like that, though.  Yep.  Whatever.  She's got a bad kick in the head.  She's got a better bicep than that.  She's got a better bicep.  She's got a better bicep.  Can I work out? 
[02:39:30]  She's in shape.  Oh, fuck, bro.  She's got the body glitter on, the old rat litter.  That's when you get caught.  Now, this is a rat litter.  Why is the pillow sparkling?  No, no, no, no.  Bobby, you know what?  Put a rub a little bit on your forehead.  Brooke, Brooke, I'll throw this ring down the hallway.  Do you mind?  Uh-oh.  Yeah, that's like a guitar.  And it's a different perfume today from last time, I think, yeah?  Yeah, this one is sensuous.  Sensuous.  Yeah.  It fucking rules. 
[02:40:00]  It's like Vespa.  It rules, right?  Yeah.  Get a clone out that's named Vespa.  Vespa, the white unicorn?  Yeah, the white unicorn.  What kind of Vespa?  You pink one?  It's pink, yeah.  And yours is white, Bobby.  We can go down the street together.  They're saying when we have to wrap this up.  Yeah.  Busy today?  Busy?  I guess.  Busy day.  I don't know.  I'm kind of chilling right now.  That's what they tell us.  But if you want to, it's up to you.  She's got to go.  See, it's her job to go, no, man.  I want to hang.  And then everyone else taps their watches.  Get her out of there.  He'll tap their watches. 
[02:40:30]  Who's that?  Saying that.  That's Steve.  Steve.  You want to see Steve real fast?  And their people.  Steve.  Does he ride a Vespa, too?  Well, he probably would.  Steve.  No.  Steve rides a Harley.  No, he doesn't.  Oh, really?  A really?  You're the first one ever to say that.  Hardly.  Hardly Davidson.  Everyone wants us to arm wrestle Brooke.  You want to arm wrestle Brooke?  I'd love to.  Can you arm wrestle Bobby?  All right.  Let's arm wrestle.  You know what, though?  I really am not that strong.  All right.  Let me do something.  She just.  I think she's going to lose on purpose.  I don't know. 
[02:41:00]  I think.  I don't like how quick she was.  Yeah, no problem.  No, she gave a look like.  No, I actually lost.  I lose to my boyfriend.  I can't arm wrestle.  Because I don't have the tendon strength, you know?  I have weak little tendons.  I have strong muscles.  I can lift heavy weight.  Please lose this, Bobby.  Put your elbow on the table.  Okay.  What if I just.  Put your elbow on the table.  This would just suck if I snapped her arm and a bone popped out and I'm the guy who  hurt.  Yeah, it would.  Robert Kelly, Brooke Hogan, arm wrestling.  All right.  Wait a second now.  Brooke Hogan, don't cheat.  The CD's called.  You're not a cheater. 
[02:41:30]  If you beat Bobby.  Look how beautiful her hand is.  If you beat Bobby, we're going to play a song off your CD because I think she's going  to lose on purpose.  Okay.  We play a song from The Redemption if you beat Robert Kelly in arm wrestling.  Okay.  Match.  Here we go.  Wait a minute.  You're getting all feisty now.  What are you getting all worked up?  Does she feel strong as you're just sitting there holding hands?  She feels strong?  Dude, look at her hand and look at my little thin Filipino boy fingers.  You have tiny fingers.  Bobby, you're loving holding her hand, aren't you?  Dude, I'll see her all day.  You know, I got a definite. 
[02:42:00]  I'm working on getting the glitter all over.  All right.  Here we go.  Yeah.  Brooke Hogan versus Robert Kelly.  All right.  Wait.  Wait.  Here we go.  Ready?  Yeah.  Ready?  Oh, my God.  I'm kind of nervous.  Ready?  No.  Just beat him.  Please.  All right.  Wait a second now.  Wait.  You're going to put your eye ready?  Come on.  All right.  Go.  We'll never forget you, Brooke, if you beat him.  Oh, my God.  I had a...  One, two, three, go.  All right.  Go ahead.  One, two, three, go.  All right.  Come on, Brooke.  Come on.  Give it some.  Come on.  Think I'm the guy that's dating your mom.  Oh, why would you say that? 
[02:42:30]  Hey, Mom.  Where's my surfboard, dude?  Oh, yeah.  I don't have to wear underwear around the house.  Hey, do you mind if I sleep in Brooke's old bed?  She's going to punch you in the face.  Oh, she's getting real bad.  I started ramps up.  I was using my abs.  You're pretty strong.  Woo.  You actually made my...  Let's just wrestle.  Come on.  My what?  Let's just wrestle.  Hey, that was pretty good.  I like that.  So do I get a song played off or did I lose? 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, no.  We'll play a song.  What do you want us to play for you today?  I don't know.  Whatever you want to play.  People turn off the channel, but that's all right.  Just because they're rockers.  Give me your CD.  We'll play whatever you want.  Oh, sorry.  I'm holding it.  Yeah.  Which one?  I would say...  Do we go with Dear Mom or do we go with this single?  You can play Dear Mom or you can do the single Hey Yo! that's coming out.  You pick.  You go ahead and do your thing.  Well, that's a lot of pressure.  Pick one.  See, you...  It's your CD.  Hey, make a decision.  Let's play.  You decide. 
[02:43:30]  I'm sure your people are going to play the single Hey Yo!  Let's play the single and then let Curiosity Kill the Cat with Dear Mom and everybody check  out Dear Mom when you go grab it.  And are you leaving as we play this?  I might.  All right.  Brooke Hogan, The Redemption.  It's Hey Yo!  Thank you.  Thank you so much, you guys.  Thanks, Brooke.  Just becoming a friend of the show.  I kind of like this.  We got to get your dad on the show is what we need.  I know, right?  Oh, God.  I think he would like the show.  He did our...  He did that live broadcast at a ball.  Yeah.  Whatever.  It was a while ago.  All right.  It's good enough to have Brooke on.  Brooke Hogan.  Thank you, guys. 
[02:44:00]  All right.  Always good to have Brooke on.  Hey Yo!  From The Redemption.  Good luck with that.  Right, that's right.  Good day.  Come here, Brooke.  Come here.  Tonight, the Hogan's slam.  We need to talk about your mom and her 19-year-old boyfriend.  Yeah, of course I screwed it up.  Here's...  That's the intro.  That's the intro to the entire album.  There goes Brooke Hogan.  And here's...  Hey Yo!  We'll be right back. 
[02:44:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:45:00]  It is called the redemption, though.  You just have to be, you know.  Right there.  What?  She can't hear us.  She just came in and beat the shit out of all of us. 
[02:45:30]  I know.  Let me tell you something about Brooke Hogan that I didn't realize until she stood up.  Holy shit, her body's in shape.  Yeah, she got in shape.  Holy shit.  She was talking about her pouchy belly or whatever.  There's no pouchy belly there.  Also, she's 20.  Right.  You know?  Bounces back nice.  Yeah, she is.  Let me tell you something.  That's my speed right there.  Isn't she thinking, why are they talking over my song?  Shh.  Because she can look in the window.  No, we're playing the song.  Yeah, we're just talking into the microphone.  We are assholes. 
[02:46:00]  Why would we be talking?  We're talking.  You're eating.  I'm talking.  I'm staring.  I'm giving her twinkle fingers through the window.  Just assholes.  You know what?  You yelling and screaming about her mom's boyfriend as your armrested.  That was really funny.  That's pretty good.  I think I'll sleep in Brooke's bed.  Dude, I will.  Michael Emerson's here?  She does it.  We're going to get her in in a second.  And we've got to take a break before Michael, if that's cool.  God.  Huh?  She does it, man, for me.  See the size of her hand?  You see that myth?  Was she strong?  You could catch Roger Clemens' fastballs with those hands. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, what she said when she left, she goes, you weren't really trying, were you?  No.  I would have ripped her arm off and hit her with it if I wanted to.  Would you?  Was she pretty strong, though?  No.  She wasn't strong at all?  No.  No.  No, Sam would be stronger than her.  Really?  Yeah, Sam has fought me more than her.  See, you know what?  We picked the wrong person to arm wrestle.  Will she come back to arm wrestle Sam?  Yeah, she should do Sam.  Me, it wasn't that.  Yeah, that would have been Sam losing to Brooke Hogan.  His freaking hair is just freaking me out. 
[02:47:00]  All right, why don't we take a break and get Michael Emerson from Lost in here?  That's pretty cool.  Yes.  All the big stars coming in today, huh?  I mean, you can take a break for the next hour and a half while Anthony goes on about Lost.  No, you're a Lost guy, too.  Actually, Travis should probably come in here for this also.  You're going to let Travis sit at the big table?  Travis is very good and knows Lost.  He knows a lot.  He's got theories.  He's got lots of questions.  I would like for Travis to join the program.  Can I not be a silent partner for a segment? 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, you can.  All right, that'd be good.  Okay, look.  You know what?  I've got to ask this.  I've never watched...  Who the fuck stinks?  Someone smelled so fucking bad.  I'm still smelling Brooke's perfume.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  There was an unshoweredly smell going on.  All right.  Who's going to smell everybody?  I will.  But I think we know who it was.  Was I right?  I bring everyone in.  Bobby, you have to smell everybody and find out who's stinking today.  Okay.  Does he have to smell their cracks?  No.  No, no.  Do the jeans. 
[02:48:00]  Do the jeans.  Do the jeans.  It wasn't even a thing that had to be...  It was really bad?  It took up the whole...  It was like Tippi Tom.  Shut the fuck up.  Okay, man.  Who was it?  Smell Sam real fast.  I think it's Steve.  I think it's Steve.  Come here.  Come here.  Let me see you.  I do.  Pick your pit up.  No.  Sam smells good.  Pick your pit up.  Oh, my God.  Bobby's just...  Yeah, he smells good.  He smells good.  Oh, stop.  He's holding.  It's like I'm watching the beginning of a fucking game porn. 
[02:48:30]  What are you wearing?  Secret?  No, it's just deodorant.  Sam, can we reenact Sonny Ferrelli's retarded uncle thing?  Bobby will play the part of the retarded uncle and try to dry hump you.  He chases you around first.  He'll chase you around the small studio.  It's a terrible idea.  All right, Bobby, you're playing the part of the retarded uncle.  Right.  And Sam, you're going to play the part of the scared little kid trying to get away from  the retarded uncle.  And this does end with Bobby catching you and trying to hump you.  And hump you.  You can say yes.  But I don't do anything.  I don't, like, put it in.  I just rub it in the crease of your ass. 
[02:49:00]  I think we have a guest way there.  No.  Like, I mush your ass together like cleavage.  It's video time, Sam.  It's not video time.  All right, here we go.  Move on to the next segment of the show.  All right, we're going to play retarded uncle.  Bobby is going to play the part of retarded uncle.  Sam, the scared little kid.  Bobby's going to run around the room and try to catch the scared little kid playbiting by  at not Sam on Twitter.  Well, I appreciate that.  And here goes retarded uncle running around catching Sam, the scared kid. 
[02:49:30]  He threw him down the ground.  He's now spanking.  Oh, my God.  He just picked him up and dropped him.  He picked him up by the pants.  Look at this.  He gave him a wedgie.  And now he's rolling him over.  No.  He's rolling Sam over.  Now he's picked him up by the back of his pants and drops him on the floor.  Wow, Bobby's strong.  Wow.  What happened to the dry humping part?  Oh, sorry.  And then he's got to pin him on the floor and dry hump him.  Oh, boy.  Oh, man. 
[02:50:00]  This is a prison rape.  This is what a prison rape looks like.  All right.  Because Sam's powerless to do anything.  You know what?  Sam's fighting back a little bit.  He wants to get him on.  Oh, he just spanked Sam.  Oh, Sam takes Bobby down.  He's strong.  This is amazing.  They're both on the floor.  Now Sam is in a chokehold.  Bobby puts Sam in a chokehold.  Now he's on the floor pinned down.  And he is now the humping should start.  He's pulling the back of Sam's pants down. 
[02:50:30]  That actually fucked me up.  I seen a little pimple on his cheek.  You guys are fucked, man.  Yeah, I'm okay.  How's your dignity?  Hey, Sam, come here.  And a hug.  See that takedown?  I actually got turned off because I saw hair on his little belly.  Oh, you moved it.  See that takedown?  You don't like that in your twigs, do you, Bobby?  There's Michael Emerson.  Should we get him right in now? 
[02:51:00]  We probably should.  No?  No.  It'll be okay?  We got a break?  Yeah, Danny's panicking.  We got a break?  Bobby, what are you promoting?  We got to take a quick break.  Funny bone.  Funny bone this weekend.  We missed you, Bobby.  Columbus, Ohio, this weekend.  I want to talk about the Dane Cook tour after Michael Emerson because, man, I was on the  phone with Bobby a couple times and, man, you were living the life and I want you to  share it with that and the rest of the audience.  I'm unplugged from the Matrix and I'm in Columbus, Ohio.  But you've got to explain what a typical day was like on tour with Dane Cook. 
[02:51:30]  We'll do it after.  Quick break and we'll get Michael Emerson from Lost in next.  Opian Anthony.  All right, we've got to get right into this, man.  Very cool.  Who's our guest, Anthony?  Michael Emerson.  Of course.  Ben from Lost, of course.  Yes.  Hi, Michael.  Hi, guys.  How are you doing again?  Good.  Good to see you.  Good to see you.  Bobby, it's okay.  Well, it wasn't that swine flu, was it?  You were sick, too?  I hope not.  I was sick as a swine.  Yeah?  Bad.  Everyone's been sick.  In the summer, it's stupid. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  No, it was intense and then it was over.  Yeah.  Yeah, good.  Good.  Quickly.  You were at that Comic-Con thing, right?  Oh, my God.  Now, I can only imagine.  So crazy.  Yeah.  The people.  Because Lost, huge.  I mean, it's just got a huge following.  Internet following is giant.  Right.  The speculation and everything.  Oh, my God.  What was it like now being face-to-face with those fans?  Well, you don't dare be face-to-face with it. 
[02:52:30]  I mean, there's 140,000 kind of maniacal fans of sci-fi and comic books there.  Inside the convention hall, you can't see the ends of it.  And it's shoulder-to-shoulder with people.  And then we do our panel in a room that holds 7,000 people.  It's bigger than Radio City Music.  7,000 people.  Some of them had camped out for 24 hours.  Now, did you ever, growing up with, like, watching maybe Star Trek or anything, did you  ever see those people at the convention or the shows about them and ever think, oh, my 
[02:53:00]  God, I'm going to be on a show where people treat me like that?  That's the last thing I expected.  Yeah.  I mean, it's kind of nice to be on a genre show, you know, that has a passionate following.  But, wow, I wasn't quite ready for that energy that surged toward us.  Now, we, uh, well, Travis over here is a giant fan, of course.  Well, he's a small fan, but he's a giant fan of the show. 
[02:53:30]  He came up with a couple of theories based on the clips that were played at the convention.  Well, I don't think they're exclusively mine.  No, no, I would say they are.  All right, they're mine.  I'm going to claim them.  That, uh, that, you know, um, they said that they're not doing flashbacks.  They did that already.  Flash forwards have been done.  Time travel has been done.  So from the three commercials that we saw, Hurley working at the chicken factory, or the  chicken store that he runs now. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, Mr. Clucks.  Kate on America's Most Wanted.  Yeah.  And Oceanic having 30 years of perfect service.  Right.  Can we maybe assume that maybe the final season might deal with, uh, things that could  have been if, uh, if, let's say that bomb did go off and reset everything?  That, that seems to be one of the threads that they're going to explore.  I don't know if they're going to do that in tandem with others.  I mean, even if there were people who returned to a state of innocence and were unaware of the 
[02:54:30]  events of the last five years, there will be other characters ongoing who know jolly well  what happened.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  Like, like, okay, let's say that it does reset.  Everything goes back.  They get to LA.  They all get off the plane and go about their separate ways.  Although we all know they're tied together somehow through fate.  Right.  So, I don't know.  But you're still on the island.  Yeah.  The plane didn't crash, but you guys are still having a...  Yeah, Ben doesn't get reset.  No, you don't get reset.  Jacob doesn't get reset.  So you guys are all still there. 
[02:55:00]  Right.  Doing that, which, um, entertaining as hell, I got to say.  Yeah.  Uh, your, your character last season, did you find it odd?  Because I found it a little odd, like, uh, your character throughout the entire series,  and then this last season, you actually became sympathetic.  You became a sympathetic character, which I thought would have been impossible to do.  It was a very gradual process.  It really was.  Like, you barely noticed it, and then all of a sudden you're going, wait, this scumbag,  I feel bad for him now. 
[02:55:30]  Like, first of all, it must be, um, fantastic to have to go into makeup and just put cuts  and bruises on your face every time you're, you're doing a shot.  Every morning.  Don't wish for it.  I think I'm the most beaten character in the history of television.  It has to be.  I was, we, we text like a couple of fruits, uh, back and forth, me and Travis, when the  show is on.  And it's like, hey, Ben didn't get punched this episode.  I think it was one, I think it was one episode where you didn't get hit in some way, shape  or form.  We, we had a day on the set, actually, where we ran out of spaces on my face to put a new 
[02:56:00]  wound.  We, I think we canceled a punch because there, there was nowhere for it to land that wasn't  already bloody and bruised.  You know what's great about, uh, the makeup on the show even is, uh, the fact that the  scars, all the scarring from the old beatings are left there.  And if you look like Locke still has the scar by his eye.  And it gradually disappeared.  Like, I think that's something that is taken for granted on the show that, uh, detail.  Um, they keep this fabulous makeup and wound Bible. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, is that it?  In the makeup trailer.  Must be a lot of pictures being taken.  Oh, like a hundred thousand Polaroids are in there.  Yeah, I can see that.  Uh, now again, back to the, uh, uh, convention.  Um, who else was there on the, on the panel?  It was you?  Uh, Jorge came and Josh came, Sawyer.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, Richard Alpert was there.  Mr. Nesta Carbonell did a gag about eye makeup.  And in the end, the big surprise at the end of the panel was they had Dominic Monaghan. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Now that kind of fueled speculation as to, uh, the whole what happens if thing, yeah.  The suggestion is that he's, he's part of our next season.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know in what capacity.  And I don't know if it's like a return from the dead kind of deal or some kind of messing  around in time.  But they've said they're not going to, they're not going to play with time so much.  Which is, I don't know how the hell.  And then there's, there's the, uh.  It's just so goddamn confusing.  But it's gotta be great to be on the show and even be killed off. 
[02:57:30]  Cause it's like, I don't know.  I could be back.  It's not like a show you get killed off of and, yeah, you're done.  We know, we know how several characters who have appeared more on the show since being  killed than they did when their characters were alive.  Yeah.  Yes, Travis?  Have you, Anthony, have you seen the final season, uh, poster that they revealed at Comic-Con?  All, all, all.  Now, I find this interesting and I want to ask Michael.  Oh.  Uh, why would Locke be the only one with his back to the poster? 
[02:58:00]  I suppose because the identity of the character he plays is in question.  Yes!  We can't put a name on who he is anymore.  Exactly.  It's just cause he, I think he's merely a vessel right now.  He is.  As was Jack's father for a time.  Because they're just, they were just dead, they were dead on the plane.  I don't think they ever came back to life or anything.  I think they were being used as a vessel by this guy that wanted to kill Jacob. 
[02:58:30]  Christian Shepard.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yes, uh, Greg?  I'm starting to think I really should start watching this show.  Yeah, maybe you should watch the damn show.  I don't know what's wrong with you.  Just so Michael knows, I'm trying to become the last person in America that hasn't seen Lost.  And I got to-  Well, you are, I think.  I'm in competition with about 5,000 people.  You know what you do?  I'm getting there, though.  Oh, I get-  Here's what you do.  Take the last episode of the last season.  Just watch that.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  You'll figure it all out. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, you'll figure it all out.  It's not really a show you could jump into like that, but, uh, and they're rerunning  it on a lot of, uh, where is it?  Sci-fi, I guess?  Sci-fi.  That's right.  And ABC airs it at like 2 in the morning on the weekends.  And I never thought it would be one of those shows that I can just kind of watch one episode  of.  Like, uh, you know, Seinfeld comes on.  You can watch an episode.  It doesn't matter.  Like, Lost is so episodic.  And, you know, you've got that storyline going.  But it really is, it's got that re-watchability when you come on and go, oh yeah, I remember  this episode.  What happened with that? 
[02:59:30]  You're like, well, that's because you've mastered the storyline, though.  I mean, once you have it all in your head, then you can bounce around.  Then you can bounce around.  Anybody else is just going, ah, ah.  And it is surprising that a show that you do have to kind of catch from the beginning  gets so popular because it does involve a little more work than people want to put  in to watch in a TV show.  It does.  I think it was supposed to involve more work from the get-go.  And that's why there was a certain amount of audience attrition.  You know, I don't think, the first season was sort of a tease in a way. 
[03:00:00]  It suggested a simpler show than it was going to deliver, ultimately.  It seemed like it was going to be Gilligan's Island of the New Millennium.  Right.  You know, here it is.  They are stranded on an island.  And what, are they going to have, you know, the Harlem Globetrotters come on every week  or so and get stranded, too?  That's why I didn't watch.  But then, you know what, though?  That first, the pilot episode, we had talked about this.  It just blew me away.  It was like, wow, that is really a well-done pilot because now I want to see the next episode. 
[03:00:30]  And by the time you start seeing it, it's like, what's in the jungle?  What is that?  It's not just a stranded show?  Yeah, just a suggestion of something a little off.  Yeah, a little off.  Are they ever going to let you know what the smoke monster is, though?  I think we kind of got a little line on what that was all about.  Yeah, I mean, we're sort of halfway there already.  Yeah.  But it's a smoke monster with TVs in it that show you things, like old reruns of The Odd Couple.  Well, no.  But I think we already have a sense that it's more than smoke. 
[03:01:00]  I mean, we know that it's ancient.  Yeah.  We know that it existed in the time of the pharaohs and maybe beyond.  It's got to be mechanical.  Spiritual, I think.  And my sense is that it's made up of fine metallic fragments that can be animated in some electromagnetic way.  Damn.  Dude, your eyes made me understand that.  The actor who played Mr. Echo, I don't remember his name.  Alewale.  But he expressed that he would like to come back. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, did he?  Yeah.  You didn't know?  No, I hadn't heard that.  But someone said he was at Comic-Con.  I didn't see him.  He said a couple weeks ago, I think, in TV Guide, he kind of expressed remorse for leaving.  Ah, yeah.  Yeah, well, it must be sad.  Yeah, he said that he would like to come back in the final season and maybe finish off his character.  That he kind of forced them to finish off.  Give him Shelley Long's phone number.  Wow.  That's interesting. 
[03:02:00]  Because he had a great and compelling character.  Oh, yeah.  He was a fan favorite.  When people ask me what role, if you could pick another role on the show to play, I always say Mr. Echo.  Really?  Yeah, because his was, there was great gravity and mystery in his backstory.  And, you know, we felt for him.  He, more than any other character, was living out some moral dilemma or a moral rebirth.  And I thought it was, you know, strong stuff.  You, your character was only supposed to be, like, a few days or a few episodes. 
[03:02:30]  And then, um...  Three, to begin with.  Three.  So, when they came back to you and just went, wow, this seems to be working.  Like, what, what, did, were you attributing it to, like, all right, I kind of got a grasp on this character?  Or...  Yeah, I mean, I'm one of those actors that does a lot of guest spots.  And, like, most guest spot actors...  Yeah, you pop up on stuff now, which is really funny.  It's like, that has been... 
[03:03:00]  A bunch of law and order stuff.  And you just keep your head down, try not to, you know, try not to gum up the works, show up, do your work, and go home.  So that was, you know, that was what I was going to do when I went out there.  And I guess they got used to me or decided to keep me around before it ever dawned on me.  I just wasn't being allowed to go home, you know, episode after episode.  Oh, there's some more lines from my character.  Keeping in that closet.  Oh, that's nice.  Talking about his stupid balloon trip. 
[03:03:30]  It was a great way to introduce the character, because it was just...  A lot of the characters, it's such a mystery as to who they are and what they are.  And yours especially was like, there was no way to think you were who you were when you were first introduced to the storyline.  That's right.  And then as it came about...  Because it always seemed like someone else was in charge.  And then you realized what a low man on the totem pole that person you thought was in charge was.  Yeah.  And then you, it was like, that was the last guy of all people that we thought it was going to be.  Well, I think if I read correctly, they decided that if they weren't happy with your performance, 
[03:04:00]  they would have just made the leader someone else.  Yeah, I think it was a kind of on-air audition in a way.  And if I hadn't been the right guy to play the adversary, whoever that was going to be,  they could have done away with me easily and tried a different form.  Tom Friendly would still be around.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, exactly.  It could have been something like that.  Yeah, he's another one that just shows up on things.  Yeah, that guy.  When you read like last year's, and I don't know how much of the scripts you actually get, 
[03:04:30]  but last season, and I brought up earlier how you became a more sympathetic character.  Or did you kind of like, because I know as an actor, you probably get attached to the character  and his traits and things like that.  Yeah.  Did you kind of like the direction that they were taking you in, where people are kind of like,  oh, God, he loses his daughter like that, and kind of more of a sympathetic character  than just, you know, always going, oh, that Ben, Jesus Christ.  It was okay with me the way it went.  I was slow in identifying any new trends. 
[03:05:00]  You know, you do it so incrementally, scene by scene, episode by episode.  So you're almost, you're almost in a change of character before you even realize that  it has taken place.  That it happens.  Oh, yeah, all of a sudden, oh, I'm vulnerable all of a sudden.  Yeah.  Oh, look, I have no power anymore.  I'm trooping around like a whip dog, you know, at the back of the pack.  Yeah, that kind of felt weird.  It's strange, right?  As a fan of the show and of the characters so much, it's just like, God, do something.  Would you hit somebody back or get someone to hit somebody? 
[03:05:30]  You know, because Locke was just, and although, as I said, I don't think it's Locke in there,  but to see Locke treating you like that was just like, oh, God, what a turnaround that was.  But Ben's not out.  You know, the wheels are still turning.  Oh, hell yeah.  The sympathy that you're talking about for the character just completely climaxed at the  end when he's just begging Jacob, why have you never acknowledged him?  Yeah, yeah.  And the look on your face when he says, what about you, and it's just like, Jesus Christ, 
[03:06:00]  like, you really feel for the guy, like, for maybe the first time.  And then, of course, Ben Kilson, which is, you know, that was nice to see.  But it was interesting to see this sort of terrifying and powerful character saying,  Daddy, please be my daddy.  Yeah, it was kind of, you know, like, yeah.  Well, the back story also kind of showed you and brought, I think that brought the adult  you to more of a sympathetic place before you even got there as a character being the  adult you.  That's right.  Because of seeing what your childhood was. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  You know, and that asshole father and everything the kid went through.  Yeah.  Being shot and brutalized.  And then Saeed shooting you.  Realizing, like, well, that was kind of odd because it's like, I think he just caused the  whole thing by doing that.  But his trust now, you've screwed up the little lad's trust.  That's right.  And he's going to grow up now to be this guy because of what you did.  Never be the same.  So it's kind of a paradox.  When Richard Alpert took away his limp little body, he said, I'll bring him back, but he'll 
[03:07:00]  never be the same.  We'll be the same.  Turn into the Ben we all know.  Fantastic, man.  Have you filmed any of the new one?  No.  The new one?  No?  No, I don't go to Hawaii until the middle of August.  Middle of August.  That's probably a good time to go.  And haven't seen a word of script.  Really?  I hope it gets picked up.  I know exactly what you know at this point.  That's it, huh?  That's it.  Nothing?  Just speculation.  You ever see any of the other cast members?  Are you just waiting for a minute? 
[03:07:30]  At Comic-Con or things like that.  Like me and Oprah, we don't even talk to each other during vacation.  Why would we?  They think we all live together and stuff, but you know.  No, because I'm, you know, Ken Leung and I are the only actors that are New Yorkers.  Oh, really?  So, yeah, there aren't many.  So, what are you doing during the off time?  You got, my wife is on True Blood for HBO, so.  Yes, Jimmy Norton, as a matter of fact, met her.  I love that show.  Yeah.  That show is one of my favorite shows.  Yeah.  It's an unbelievable show, True Blood.  Yeah, yeah.  So, she was working.  On the summer break, I try to follow her around, because, you know, we see little enough of each other during the filming season. 
[03:08:00]  Who's your wife on True Blood?  Carrie Preston, she plays Arlene, the red-headed waitress, the smart-ass southern waitress.  Her husband on the last season was the killer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, thanks.  Thanks for that.  Like, I didn't give away enough spoilers for people that are still catching up on Lost anyway.  But the good thing about giving away spoilers on Lost, though, is people won't even, they'll get to that point and go,  Oh, all right, that's what he was talking about. 
[03:08:30]  But, yeah, there's no way you could really spoil it for somebody that hasn't seen it yet.  But on Lost, there's so many spoilers you can give on this one I just gave away.  The whole season was about this one thing.  I just ruined the whole season.  We got someone that's obsessed with Michael Emerson.  She needs in Desperate Lead, Laura.  Oh, it's Laura.  Newsday, Laura.  Newsday.  Hi, boy.  Hello.  Hi.  Michael Emerson's here, Laura.  I know.  Oh, my God, hi.  Hello.  I'm completely obsessed with you. 
[03:09:00]  Hello, Laura.  I have no idea.  It's, like, kind of scary.  This is like the Comic-Con.  I want you to treat me like Juliet, and I've been very bad.  Jesus Christ.  Is that a good line?  I don't even know.  You're out of your mind.  Is that a bad thing for her to say?  Well, yeah.  Poor Juliet.  Of course.  Poor Juliet, right?  We love Juliet, though.  We love Elizabeth Mitchell.  Newsday, Laura, you got a question from Michael Emerson?  No, I just wanted him to know how much he is loved. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, thanks very much.  Look at people calling me fanboy.  Yes, I'm a fanboy.  What are you talking about?  It's all in with Lost.  I'm totally all in.  Who wouldn't be?  Great show.  What do you do?  Yeah, but they're fans of yours.  Fan people of right.  I know.  You fanboys.  I don't want...  You're listening to my show, fanboy.  I don't want Michael Emerson to be insulted.  I just blew it with Lost.  I know it's a show I should have watched, and then now I'm too far out of it, so I got 
[03:10:00]  the box that's ready to go.  Let her rip.  So, you know, I hope you don't take that the wrong way, because I know that I would enjoy  Lost if I would just sit down and commit.  No, you're in a great position.  You're on the verge of great pleasure.  Yeah.  I envy him.  I envy you, because you have the whole thing to live through for the first time.  And he's going to see it festival-style.  Yeah.  One after the other.  Dr. Michu Kaku explained Lost. 
[03:10:30]  I got it right in front of me.  Michu Kaku.  Do you know who Dr. Michu Kaku is?  No, I'm not.  Is this worth playing for Michael?  He just explains the island.  Oh, he explains it in his terms, right?  He's a physicist, but as far as physicists go.  It's short, so let's see if this goes anywhere.  There's one episode where this elderly woman goes to a pendulum and begins to explain the  whole thing, that the island is special.  There's something on the island that allows them to create a tunnel network to other points, 
[03:11:00]  and that's how they're able to move the island, and by going through the tunnel,  they're able to go to different points in space.  That something on the island is probably a negative matter meteorite, probably a meteorite  that slammed into the island.  Negative matter allows you to create gateways, gateways to other points in space and time,  and that's what drives the entire series.  That's why you have these bizarre things happening when people go backwards in time and meet themselves 
[03:11:30]  and stuff like that.  There you go.  You explained it.  Yeah.  Well, I guess I don't have to watch the last season.  But I think all regular viewers sort of understood that already.  Kind of.  Oh, really?  I mean, they may not have had a negative eye on meteorite terminology for it, but they  knew that the island contains a portal, some kind of magic gateway or door that allows you  to move through time and space.  Yeah.  Maybe it's just Mario Brothers or something.  Yeah.  Like Mario Brothers.  How long do you spend out in Hawaii filming? 
[03:12:00]  It's eight months to shoot the season.  Wow.  That's got to suck.  Do you have a house out there?  Do you rent?  Do you own something out there?  I always sublet a condo somewhere in Waikiki, and then I put my stuff in storage during the  summer.  I'm one of those superstitious actors that I feel like to go there and buy a house would  guarantee my being killed off the show.  So better to stay loose, remain a gypsy actor, and keep it.  Now, Michael, I mean, there's a lot of downtime in filming, obviously, so what else do you do 
[03:12:30]  in Hawaii?  See, now I could be in on the conversation.  There you go.  I like this.  Yeah, Hawaii.  What do you do on the downtime in Hawaii?  You know, I wander the streets of Honolulu.  I try to get a handle on that town.  I think the hiking is great in Hawaii.  You know, you can't go a mile inland from the shore anywhere without being in high, you  know, rainforest.  And, you know, it's biologically and botanically beautiful, strange birds, you know, odd trees 
[03:13:00]  and shrubs and flowers.  I think it's beautiful that way.  Do you ever run into Dog the Bounty Hunter?  No, but he lives there.  Yeah.  You never saw him cruising around with his mullet?  No.  Just cruising around.  No, I think I'd be afraid if I saw him covering that.  With his big, giant can of mace.  Yeah, and no, they have guns now.  Oh, do they?  Yeah, they have, they look like machine guns, but it's...  Paintballs?  Paintball mace.  You know, something Dog needs...  He is much beloved, though. 
[03:13:30]  On the islands?  On Oahu, yeah.  I'd love that if the last episode, it was just Dog.  He ran everything.  I watched all you guys, at one point or another, really trudging up and down hills and hiking  around and stuff.  You've got to...  Now, aside from Hurley, I mean, you've got to be in some kind of shape, I would imagine,  not to be exhausted.  The work is rough.  Yeah.  It's physically rough, and sometimes we're shooting at locations that, you know, they  can't get the vans there.  They can't get all the trucks and the catering, all of that. 
[03:14:00]  I mean, we have shot days where, you know, we were hunkered down under umbrellas in the  sun, taking our lunch.  You know, I don't know how they got the lunch there, but it can be hot, and the bugs are  bad, and...  Yeah.  And physically, yeah, a lot of trekking, a lot of climbing rocks, and repeatedly, you  know.  A thing that you do once may be a lark, but when you've done it 25 times, your body begins  to rebel on you. 
[03:14:30]  Go back down there, and I'll climb back up, and...  Exactly.  Only this time, climb with more intensity, and...  I can't.  I'm exhausted.  So you got anything...  Fall through the temple?  Yeah, fall through the temple.  That's another one.  How many times?  Stunts?  Yeah, stunts.  Yeah, don't even talk to me about the stunts, and I'm one of those game actors that doesn't  quit while I'm ahead, you know.  Usually, the deal is they won't bring in a stunt double until you cry uncle, but...  Oh, okay.  Until I'm majorly wounded, I'll just keep doing it.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:15:00]  Take after take after.  That's pretty cool.  And pretty soon, the scene is over, and I feel bad because the stunt double hasn't gotten  a chance to go on, and I've probably sustained some injuries that will hurt me worse.  It's worse the next day than they did at the time.  How better the bug bites?  They have sneaky mosquitoes there that are unlike any I've seen.  You don't feel them when they're on you, and then about an hour later, a whole patch  of your skin is inflamed.  Jesus.  And not so much itchy as hurdy.  Yeah, they're... 
[03:15:30]  Hurdy.  Itchy, hurdy, snicker, snicker.  Yeah, those are some exotic bugs they got over there.  What's the...  What's the...  What's the...  Because I'm sure being out in the jungle like that, what's the...  The oddest thing you might have seen that was not meant to be there?  Pigs in the night.  Really?  Because the island is...  Sounds like my house sometimes.  The island is...  The island has...  Up in the mountains and stuff, there's a bunch of feral pigs.  Really?  That have escaped, you know, I guess decades ago, and they're running around in the night, 
[03:16:00]  and some of them, great big white ones, say they're like ghost pigs, and you see them  out in the jungle, running around.  That's creepy.  You know, it's kind of strange.  It gives you pause.  It's a little creepy.  Aside from following your wife around now, what are you doing in the off time in New York?  You're working at all, or...?  No, no.  I've had little bits and pieces.  You know, I have so many friends that are filmmakers or theater makers. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, boy, that film must rank.  I'll do a day here, a couple of days there, you know, on the project.  I did a thing for PBS where I play a Puritan radical creature.  I think that'll go next year sometime.  They're doing a history of religion in America.  That'll turn up on YouTube or something like that.  It's like, look, here's Ben playing.  And this guy looks even worse than Ben.  Well, Michael, thank you.  Thanks.  Absolutely. 
[03:17:00]  And Travis, of course.  Look, look at Travis.  I just saw him gawking at you.  I was listening.  No, no, you were...  Intensively listening.  As Michael's head was turned this way, I looked, and I just saw Travis, like, staring  at your glasses.  Don't turn this around on me.  No, he was staring at you.  Very creepily.  You're going to leave him alone, right?  Fanboy.  What?  You're going to leave him alone.  Yes, yes.  You're not going to follow him or anything.  No.  Okay, good.  That's all we need to know.  I will say best of luck.  Thanks.  Because, you know, I know you're superstitious, but I don't think you need luck with this show. 
[03:17:30]  And we live in the same neighborhood, so I'll see you around the neighborhood.  Yeah, good.  Oh, shut up.  I swear, we live in Hell's Kitchen.  I don't care if you live in the same neighborhood.  We bump into each other every once in a while.  All right, how about...  We'll buy the Amish market while we're getting...  How about he doesn't want everyone to know where he fucking lives?  You know how big Hell's Kitchen is?  It's not like I set a street, you jackass.  You said the Amish thing, though.  That's in Long Island or Brooklyn.  You said Amish, though.  That doesn't help.  Yeah, but that means nothing.  I don't know where he lives.  That's right.  It's in the middle of Hell's Kitchen.  But I'll go next time.  Some psycho's going to go up and down every block every day. 
[03:18:00]  You're right.  Did you hear Laura's call?  I'm a big fan of...  Of course.  You're right.  You're a big fan of Lost, too.  I'm a big fan of Lost, but I'm a huge fan now of True Blood.  True Blood is a great show.  It's the same thing as Lost.  Every week, like an hour show goes by in probably 20 minutes.  You're like, really?  Yeah, those are the worst.  When you're kind of watching and you look at the clock and go...  You know what?  You just turned down to True Blood.  Screw this Lost show.  I'm going to watch True Blood.  There you go.  True Blood's good.  You can get on the ground floor of that one. 
[03:18:30]  It's a great show.  Your wife is great on it.  Always a pleasure when you come by, man.  Thanks.  Thanks for having me.  It's fun.  When the series kicks back in, and still, I'd love to have you back on.  Sure.  It'd be great, man.  Yeah.  Thanks so much.  Say hello to the lovely little woman.  I will.  Thanks, Michael.  Thank you.  We'll finish up next.  Robert Kelly, let's not forget Funny Bone, Columbus, Ohio, all weekend long, right?  Yeah, 13 shows.  Wow.  No, I'm joking.  There's only seven, but it's...  All right.  ColumbusFunnyBone.com for details.  Opie and Anthony.  That's right.  Opie and Anthony, Robert Kelly, Funny Bone, Columbus, all weekend long. 
[03:19:00]  Robert Kelly, where do you want your fans to go, Bobby?  To my comedy shows?  No, but how do they get info?  RobertKellyLive.com.  Just go to my website.  All my stuff is on there.  Now, Bobby was on the road with Dane Cook, for what?  Six months?  Four months?  Ten weeks.  That was only ten weeks?  Two months.  It seemed like you were gone longer.  Thirty-seven shows.  And I got a couple phone calls from Bobby while he was on the road, and, man, were you living 
[03:19:30]  the life?  And I'm like, fuck, why aren't you on the air talking about this stuff?  We finally got you, but I wish we would have called you while you were still, you know,  living it.  Yeah, it was really real.  Private jets.  G4 every night.  Fly in.  You fly into the gig on the G4.  You get on the plane.  They'd have whatever...  It was the same lady, same guys flying.  That's like the Vespa of airplanes, by the way.  That's right.  That's retarded.  What do you call it?  The white unicorn?  Oh, dude. 
[03:20:00]  We had three different ones.  We can't...  Dan kept changing it because he didn't like the...  I want one like Ted Danson.  Danson.  He's going to be worth a few bucks if he's able to...  Dude.  Jesus.  What do you mean he was changing planes?  I don't like the layout.  They bring up another layout of another G4.  What's the layout of a G4?  Like, walk us through this.  Well, you could have two...  I'll never be on a G4.  You come in and there's four seats and then they turn together and they make two beds.  Or you walk in, there's two seats and one big long couch. 
[03:20:30]  And they...  And you can...  You know...  Or you can...  Yeah, you can make a bunch of...  It's like a million different configurations.  Can you sleep comfortable in between gigs if you wanted to?  Dude, I took the...  Look at that.  I took the...  Yeah, you take those seats.  Yeah, you can take them.  And they spin around and then they make a bed.  Yeah, you lie flat.  I lied in the...  There was two together and I put them down.  The table goes down and then you just lie straight out.  Wow.  Was it comfortable?  Yeah, it was...  Dude, it was unbelievable.  And then...  Now...  Yeah. 
[03:21:00]  So...  But you're laying down.  So how do you suck Dane's cock?  Well, you gotta...  This is...  You can't...  Is he on that side?  You have to put the table down because it doesn't work.  All right.  I assumed the table being there was the awkward part.  No, no, no.  The table...  That's weird.  So you gotta put the table down and then I can go right in there.  That makes sense.  Let me tell you something, Brian.  Did he have a suite on the plane himself?  Like a little area for himself or...  We had the front of the plane.  Me and Dane and Al, we caught it.  And then Al would go to the back of the plane or the middle of the plane.  And then the management and whoever else was on the plane would be way back in the back 
[03:21:30]  of the plane.  But there was no shit seat, you know?  Jesus.  But yeah, dude.  It was...  Let me tell you something.  It was the guy...  It was the fucking Matrix, dude.  Yeah.  It was the...  Yeah, of course.  It was the Matrix.  It was like...  You swallowed the right pill, right?  Red pill?  No, then I...  As soon as it was over, I was in shitty clothes with a shaved head in the fucking Nebuchadnezzar.  And I think I was...  And all of a sudden you're fighting for a cab.  Dude, I was in Sacramento Punchline. 
[03:22:00]  Just this fucking shitty Neo.  The Matrix.  That's perfect.  It was fucking awful.  It was fucking...  One day I had fucking just guns and I knew Kung Fu.  The next day I was just a shithead in a fucking shit ship.  Flying coach to some shit town.  Some fucking jack in the back of your head.  Dude, I...  In the front.  I walked out at one show.  I saw the crowd.  18,000 people showed up in...  I think it was Toronto or some...  One of the shows.  Do you really lose track of what city you're in for real? 
[03:22:30]  Dude, you forget your room.  We're flying...  We leave...  We left every night after the show.  We go right to the private jet.  Pull right up to it.  No...  I could have carried a pound of heroin in my bag and some fucking AKs.  How'd they do it?  You don't give a shit.  Fly right to the next gig.  Go to the hotel.  How many times I came downstairs to get coffee and I don't...  I don't even know what the fuck floor I'm on.  I just get in the elevator and I just look like a creep.  Because I don't push any buttons.  Because I'm just like, I don't know where I came in or what fucking floor I'm on. 
[03:23:00]  I don't know that.  Yeah.  And then...  Is it true they shopped for you while you were doing stand-up?  Do whatever the fuck you wanted.  So you're leaving the plane like, all right, I want, I don't know, homemade chocolate chip cookies tonight.  Wow.  I would text...  We would text what we wanted for lunch.  And sometimes I'd just text bullshit just to see if it would happen.  And it'd just be on the plane.  Like fucking dots.  Dots.  Just dots.  Dots.  I do notice, now we've got to get into this a little bit, you're twittering. 
[03:23:30]  You twitter a bit much.  Oh, yeah.  Let me tell you something.  First of all...  You twitter a little too much.  First of all, you twitter too less.  I want more out of you, Anthony.  I want very little twittering.  I want more out of you.  You want more twits?  I want more fucking twits out of you, yeah.  We're going to meet in the middle.  I'll stop twittering if you twitter more.  Um, no.  Why?  You twitter too much. 
[03:24:00]  You twitter too much.  Good.  I heard you broke it down or something.  Somebody...  There was something...  All right.  Here was a bad twitter.  Okay, go ahead.  I'll give you an example of an awful tweet.  Tweet.  Yeah, excuse me.  You retweeted someone that said they saw...  I think I saw Bob Kelly.  He looked so good.  He was out in front of a bookstore.  I retweeted that?  You retweeted a compliment on how you looked.  If that isn't a scream for fucking love me... 
[03:24:30]  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  What the...  First of all, let's not get carried away...  Everything everybody in this room does is a scream to fucking love me.  You were banging nails, you fucking afro faggot.  And you were doing fucking Howard Stern in front of Howard Stern.  Okay, you cocksucker.  I was doing Jackie Martin.  You're the only cocksucker that went backwards in his career.  You're supposed to start with a podcast and work your way up to a hit show.  Not work your way backwards, fuckhead.  Wow, he's got you there.  Listen.  He kind of got you there, right?  Damn.  You're on fucking at two in the morning on the internet. 
[03:25:00]  Hey, don't fucking back him up.  At least I got a web show.  I usually...  Take one second, clips of fucking lightning.  I'm usually there for you, but he kind of got you on that one.  Yeah.  And you can try to flame it this way, but he got you mad, man.  Listen, listen, listen.  The fact is...  You're putting out that fire on your own.  I know.  We're all screaming for someone to love us, okay?  It just so happens I do it in 140 characters.  We just do it in very different ways.  He's right.  I didn't buy a TV studio and put it in my mansion and go on and hire fucking all my friends 
[03:25:30]  to come over and hang with me, okay?  Hire?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it's called hire.  When you buy booze, that's fucking...  I don't hire my friends.  That's fucking monetary fucking gain for these guys.  If you didn't have shit over there, you'd think...  If you had fucking pretzels, would Danny show up?  No.  Probably.  No.  He's got a fucking fat Guinness in his hand, and he gets to drink for free on that  for some tap you have downstairs.  All right.  You know something?  Bobby is really good.  That's why I was really good. 
[03:26:00]  I wasn't going to bring up the fact that he over-tweets, because I...  Yeah.  Bobby's tough.  He's tough in this arena.  You just ripped me a new asshole, I think.  He's tough in this arena.  I think that is ripping me a new asshole.  Well, which I enjoy your show very much, because I'm screaming for it.  I love watching you, because I see someone else who's as lonely as me.  Believe me, I'd be doing the...  If I could do a podcast from fucking Columbus, Ohio this weekend in my hotel room, I would.  So, I have 140 characters for love. 
[03:26:30]  For love.  That's all I want.  140 little keystrokes of love.  Teeny little...  It's so hard to do.  It's so hard to fucking...  It really is.  Because I know there's so many motherfuckers out there, too, that just want to pounce on  your fucked up when you fuck up.  They just wait to see...  Oh, you fucking misspelled.  It's not T-O-O.  It's T-O.  You fuck you.  Fuck you.  How great is it when you use all 140 characters perfectly?  Oh, it's perfect.  And when you have two or three characters left over, you're like, fuck, I gotta use those 
[03:27:00]  two somehow.  Dude, what's the best?  It's like a puzzle, though.  You try to work it perfectly.  I want to know what's the best, though.  So, using all the characters with the period or without the period at the end of your...  With the period.  With the period.  So, the period finishes it out.  We're talking real punctuation.  Oh, okay.  Where you're not getting rid of periods and spaces.  You're like, wow, this is perfect.  This is a work of art.  And then you hit send.  I hate when you're like, oh, a minus five.  And send.  A minus five, goddammit. 
[03:27:30]  All right, let me look back.  I can take the space away from the commas.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I'll do.  I'll back the letters right up to the comma.  Yeah.  And then...  I'll just put U instead of Y-O-U.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll put U.  R instead of R.  The number two instead of T-O.  Fuck!  Now you're typing like Prince.  Yeah.  That's fucking awful.  Twitter is...  It's gotta be the end.  There's nothing.  I mean, because it literally took...  We had this whole big thing.  Back in the day, I had a website.  If you had a website, you were somebody. 
[03:28:00]  Now, MySpace made it so every dickhead can have his own little website.  With his thoughts.  That's it.  And his blogs and his videos that he likes.  And now it just went down to...  It went down to 140 characters.  Yeah, but Twitter's gonna get very boring if they don't expand it somehow.  I don't know how they do.  I don't know if you add characters, but they gotta add some other things you can do with it.  I don't know.  It's like saying texting is gonna get boring.  It's more of a...  I don't know, man.  It's a way to communicate all your shit, pictures, everything like that, to a mass of people 
[03:28:30]  instead of just one person at a time.  But the thing is, Bobby's right.  Hey, this fucking thing started out with the most technology ever.  Like computers, and you're like, holy shit, I could have a website and do this, but I  gotta learn HTML code and this, that.  And then you're putting up these websites with all kinds of links and video and all  this shit.  And then you get Facebook, and it's like, okay, well, they kind of do the website thing  for you.  I just gotta add little things.  And then it got down to Twitter.  Well, you're just like, all this technology got down to the point where all we really wanted 
[03:29:00]  to do was write a few words and maybe send a picture.  Well, all you want to do, though, is you're in a car, you're on a plane, you're at work,  you just want to look at something that will take you away from the pain of your cube.  Of you.  And if fucking me on a shitty Vespa, where you can type back fucking homo, or you can  see one of the fucking Opie's sunsets and be like, it's beautiful.  Now I repost other people's sunsets.  You know something?  I can't even argue. 
[03:29:30]  You know what?  At this point.  His Vespa picture, having the Vespa, your tweets.  Bobby, I give it up to you.  You're right.  But it's creepy.  We haven't seen you in person in probably two to three months, and I know what you've been  up to.  That's everything that Bobby's been doing.  That's a little creepy to me.  And I know what you guys have been up to.  All right.  Let me ask you a question.  Are you guys going to the UFC 101?  We're in Philly?  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Dude, let me tell you something.  This is going to be a big, what am I trying to say?  Announcement.  No, well, the announcement's Friday, supposedly, with Fedor joining the UFC, which we said would 
[03:30:00]  absolutely happen, by the way.  And who was that douchebag that called?  I can't wait.  It ain't gonna happen.  I hope he calls back.  It'll never happen.  I hope that guy calls back.  Shut it.  But we're all going to Philly.  There's going to be a big group going down there.  Dude, that BJ, Penn, and Kenny Florian fight.  See, I don't know those guys yet.  Kenny Florian is fucking, they're both jiu-jitsu guys, but insane.  And BJ is actually training his fucking ass off.  He looks great.  They all train their fucking ass off.  No, no, no, no.  Not BJ, man.  If you saw him in his fight with George St. Pierre, he was heavier. 
[03:30:30]  I mean, he had to go up in weight class, but he was heavier.  He wasn't training as fucking hard.  Now he looks shredded.  BJ comes in shredded, and he gets gassed.  He gets gassed real quick.  If he doesn't take you out in the first two rounds, he just can't breathe.  At the end of every fight, he's holding onto the ref, like, I'm going to die.  Hold me up.  There was one ref, I forget his name, was trying to get off me, man, because he was putting  his head, resting his head on his shoulder, like, I'm going to die. 
[03:31:00]  But this is going to be a great fight.  And then Forrest against Anderson.  He's just an animal.  We had Forrest.  Dude, the more he gets beat up, the fucking tougher he becomes.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  He's that type of guy.  Yeah, he's going to...  He's fucking funny, too.  He's fucking hilarious.  I think he was the most intimidating UFC fighter we had in.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, because you know what?  We had Fedor, we had, uh, holy, uh, oh my God.  Yeah, but Fedor, you...  Chuck, Chuck was in here.  When he was talking, it wasn't even about, um...  No, he's just... 
[03:31:30]  It wasn't about the art of it, and this, and the competition, or that.  He goes, I, he pretty much said, I just like beating people up.  Yeah.  Like, he likes being hit.  He likes hitting people.  Yeah, he's fucking...  That's why he does...  It's fucking...  Most...  Some guys are like, yeah, it's competition, you know?  Mano y mano, and we get in there, and I could show my art, the way I twist it.  He just...  Nah, I just like punching people in the face.  Yeah, he's fucking...  And now he can do it for a job.  You know what I watched...  You know what I did on YouTube last night?  I was up to, like, three in the morning watching, uh, jiu-jitsu. 
[03:32:00]  Lighting videos?  No, no, no.  Which are fascinating.  If you...  Jiu-jitsu versus anything.  Like, jiu-jitsu versus judo.  Jiu-jitsu versus karate.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's...  It's just...  Guy trying to do some kata.  Some fucking move, and standing sideways, and this guy just goes, okay, takes one punch,  grabs him, throws him on the ground, and breaks his fucking arm.  One of them, you hear the arm break.  He snaps it, and lets go.  He is... 
[03:32:30]  You're like, ugh!  And he just lets...  Puts his hand up, like, whoops, whoops.  Sorry.  It's...  I'm fucking...  You can't even tap out.  You have to flop out.  Your arm is fucking gone.  All right, wait a minute.  Uh, Doc Sheck from Atlanta writes, check out the video of BJ Penn, that was the guy  you were talking about, Bobby.  Yeah.  Jumping out of a three-foot end of a pool without using his hands.  Get the fuck out of here.  Dude, he...  I'm telling you.  That's got to be impossible.  It's on his...  It's on his Ning site.  Three feet is how high up on...  That would be about three feet.  Almost waist?  Dude, BJ Penn. 
[03:33:00]  I know, but I'm trying to figure out, like...  Would it be your waist?  Yeah, probably.  He's jumping out of the water.  No way.  Let me see this.  That's great.  Yeah, he's great.  Dude, he's a freak.  He's a freak.  Is he using...  Is he using any leverage?  Nothing.  Watch, watch, watch.  We're watching.  He's standing there.  He's kind of lining himself up at the edge of the pool.  He's kind of...  Wow.  He did.  Holy shit.  That'd be hard to do with no water in the pool.  With no water in the pool, that would be hard to do. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, dude.  He's a freak, dude.  He can take his legs...  Holy...  He uses his legs as fucking arms.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, he's crazy, man.  That fight's going to be fucking great.  Why does it look like he's in a pool in the set of Slumdog Millionaire, though?  What's that kid in the background?  Dude, he's in Hawaii.  He's in Hawaii.  What is that?  He's in Hawaii, dude.  Those are all fucking Hawaii.  He just goes into the jacuzzi like, oh, why?  Let's now hang.  Those are all flat-back Hawaiians.  It's like a dolphin.  But maybe the pool's really only a foot.  No, it says three right there. 
[03:34:00]  Three centimeters.  Oh, so you're going to believe it because it says three feet?  You think he had a fucking tile made up for a shit YouTube video?  Now, Bobby, we can't get to you today.  Bobby's impenetrable.  Bobby's been in training.  Bobby has been.  He's been on the road.  He's fucking in his best form.  I think we've shell-shocked him enough where he's like, you know what?  These motherfuckers, I'm going to get them next time I'm in there.  Well, it's probably because Norton's not here.  And Jimmy's not here.  Norton scares me.  Norton gets angry.  I feel like he's going to bite me with his teeth.  Although, you'd be like, to the way you are today, that'd be a good match. 
[03:34:30]  It's like comedian UFC.  I'm not, Jimmy.  You'd be very good.  Jimmy stays home.  I swear to God, he just picks guys.  I'm going to fucking think of a million things I could say about fucked up, fag, fat Bob  today.  And he writes them down.  And he fucking OCDs them.  Puts them on a card.  Rehearses them with his girl.  Dude, oh, dude, I was thinking about going to get in the Vespa, dude.  And then just files him away.  And then you say one wrong thing.  Dude, how's your chin?  My fucking chin?  Really, dude? 
[03:35:00]  Fucking dude.  He's a fucking sniper.  Dude, he's a Navy SEAL.  When you're saying he practices, that's psychotic.  Yeah, he's the...  Let me say something.  Going to the UFC with him was the...  Because he's such a fanboy.  First of all, it's not fun going to those events.  I had to give up on hanging out with Jimmy at events.  I had to.  Because I'm a fanboy.  But I am so insecure with myself.  But you don't want to move if you're Jimmy because you're going to blow the photo op.  Dude, we were the best team ever. 
[03:35:30]  I knew who everybody was.  Oh, so you guys had a good time.  So we're running through the...  I'm like, dude, that's fucking Liotta Machida right here.  Who?  Is it a good one?  Fucking good one.  That's a fucking champion.  Good one.  And then we'd run up, running around, like, take him.  That's good.  Get her.  Bang, bang.  And we'd get the photo.  I'd take the photo.  And then they'd get one of me.  The whole time, we were fanboys.  I'd say you're totally into it.  Oh, my God.  He is the fucking best.  But he is...  You know, like, you'll be talking to him and asking him questions.  But he's not listening.  He's in his own head. 
[03:36:00]  Like, Jimmy...  I don't know if he's fucking retarded or a genius.  He's like super...  I don't know what it is.  But you'll be like, hey, yeah.  So anyways...  And he'd be like...  He's assessing something.  And then he's assessing something else.  And then he goes, dude, do you have the...  Do you know what the password is for any...  He's like, what?  Were you listening to a word I said?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I was thinking of something.  I had to call Kenny.  I was thinking I should have a couple more cans of that potted meat.  But we... 
[03:36:30]  He is fucking the best motherfucker.  We had a...  I love that he's a fanboy.  We ran around like two fucking fat aunts.  You should have seen us eating cake at two in the morning.  Just shit.  That I can picture.  Just two fat assos.  Feeling guilty about it.  Trying to help each other with the guilt.  Like, dude, we work hard.  Treat yourself.  Treat yourself.  That's what Kenny does.  Treat yourself.  We were sitting next to a fighter the whole time.  Kenny's an enabler.  Oh, Kenny?  He's the worst. 
[03:37:00]  Ah, fucking unbelievable.  You deserve it.  He just wants to spoil you.  You deserve it.  Treat yourself.  I've been off since that cake with fucking Jimmy.  I've been fucking dipping back into the...  It wasn't really.  Dude, I'm back.  Stop dipping.  I'm back finally, bud.  That one...  The cake we had was like...  What's the fucking...  What is it?  A yuhu?  A yodel?  A yodel?  What the fucking...  Oh, yeah.  A fully covered chocolate thing.  What is that?  A ding?  Ring ding.  A ring ding.  A fucking ring ding.  But, like, the ultimate supreme ring ding they had at this restaurant, me and Jimmy. 
[03:37:30]  Dude, that is like fucking...  That is like if you just took a swig of Jack Daniels.  You'd be right back.  That...  You can't eat a ring ding.  No.  You can't eat a ring ding.  You're just like letting her pull the, like, side of the cock out of the panties.  Yeah.  Just like the...  You can't.  Yeah, you can't do that.  You can't.  Pulling the side of the cock out of the panties and you just go, yeah, you can't do that?  Well, the underwear.  Yeah, you can't.  If it's under there, you won't.  No, he said panties.  What the fuck?  You've never had a girl call your underwear panties? 
[03:38:00]  I call my...  I call them panties all the time.  That's ridiculous.  I wear panties all the time.  That's what I call my underwear, panties.  Yeah, sure you do.  I think girls call my underwear panties.  I wear panties.  I wear panties.  I wear panties.  No, I didn't.  Yeah, you can fight all you want now, man, but that was a little weird.  No, no, no, I didn't.  I meant it as, like, a she-mail.  Like, I can fight it as long as she doesn't pull it out, but if she sticks a little of  the helmet out, I'm going to get my money's worth.  Now I'm in.  Now I understand.  Anyways, he was...  First of all, those guys at the UFC, you guys got to fucking...  I don't know what the fuck.  Those guys... 
[03:38:30]  We've been there since the beginning.  Well, sort of the beginning.  Dude, we got so hooked up.  Yeah.  It was fucking ridiculous.  I mean...  Yeah, we'll be there, uh...  It was sick.  What is it, a week from this Saturday, I think?  Yeah, I think it is.  Something like that?  Holy shit, it's already...  Yeah, it was fucking ridiculous.  We got to get out of here.  The computer's going off.  Yeah.  God damn it.  Bobby, always a pleasure.  Bobby, very good to see you again finally.  Good to see you too, man.  Twitter all you want.  After that beating.  And I'm going to fucking put some hemorrhoid cream on and lay on my tummy after that one. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, man.  That was a good one.  We had a lot of good stuff we never got to, which means we did all right today.  Let's do it manana.  Bobby is going to be at the Funny Bone.  Where the fuck is your plug sheet?  I don't know.  What is it?  The Funny Bone in Columbus.  RobertKelleyLive.com.  Yeah, it's 614-471-5653 for tickets and information.  Go to OP Radio too for all that info on Twitter.  Rock.  I'm going to get my...  Listen. 
[03:39:30]  What's your Twitter name again?  I had that book because I wanted Robert Kelly Live, but Sam fucked me out of it.  Oh, that's right.  What a prick.  Well, I think he was trying to help, but he fucked me out of it.  Now I can't get it, but it's Robert Kelly Fans.  Oh, yeah.  I don't like that one.  I didn't want that one, but I...  I don't like that one.  I kind of like it because, you know, some of the fucking assholes, you have to type in  Robert Kelly Fans.  Oh, that's Robert Kelly, by the way.  Huh?  Is there some Robert Kelly out there?  Yeah, somebody has it.  That's kind of a, you know, common name.  Yeah, I don't have, like, Johnny Bruno. 
[03:40:00]  That's the guy who sold me my Vespa.  He's a fucking guitar player from Jersey.  Now he sells fucking cars.  Is that the best name ever?  Coming to the stage, Johnny Bruno.  He sounds like Johnny Bravo a little bit.  I want to thank Michael Emerson for stopping by.  Yes.  There were three really good instant feedbacks.  Steven S. from Bay Show writes, who does Travis love more, Michael or Dexter?  Hmm.  Dexter.  Come on.  Yeah, sure.  Rockstar China wrote, and he actually wrote from China.  Holy shit.  And I picked up on this, too, and we should have called Michael Emerson out on this a little 
[03:40:30]  bit.  Oh?  He writes, real fucking tough, hunkered down in the wilderness under an umbrella in Hawaii.  That's called a vacation for us blue-collared fucks.  Ah, that's funny.  That's true.  I think Craig Chiarelli from Scranton writes...  They brought food.  I don't know how they brought it, but I don't deal with it.  Why do we call them out on that?  Food showed up by where he's under an umbrella.  And then tell Michael Emerson I sit at a computer all day.  I'll take the rock climbing and stunts any day, dude.  He's an actor.  What do you want?  Someone's got to play the part.  You go in there and play as a compelling part as he does. 
[03:41:00]  Don't you fucking badmouth Michael Emerson.  It looks like Ant's brother right there.  Where?  Right there.  It looks like your brother.  It's Joe.  It's Joe crying on fucking Murray.  Jesus.  Doesn't it?  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I'm going to leave this five for Sam.  Thanks for the ass.  Oh, fuck.  It's right on the table.  Buy yourself something pretty.  Just fucking leave a five for him.  That'll degrade him even more.  Get some conditioner for that fucking mop you've got.  Go get yourself something nice. 
[03:41:30]  Clean yourself up and go get something nice.  Oh, good news.  If you need a new Twitter name, Bobby, Dogshit Sniffer writes, hey, Bobby, Vespa Twat is  still up for grabs.  You know what?  That's a fucking awesome name.  That's a fucking...  Vespa Twat is fantastic.  I might even switch it to that.  That's pretty good.  I'm going to be selling a Vespa in a week.  Oh, yeah.  Let's go.  Yeah, it didn't fill the hole.  Just say bye so you can go.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
