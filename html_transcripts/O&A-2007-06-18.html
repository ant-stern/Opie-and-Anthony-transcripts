<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with technical difficulties, blamed on studio tampering.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and James Norton, then recounted their "ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Tour," specifically a raucous Jones Beach show featuring extensive tailgating (including a naked man on a truck), a large, enthusiastic crowd, and technical issues with the backstage video feed.  They detailed an impromptu roast of themselves and other comedians, including playing an embarrassing old radio show tape.  Callers shared their Jones Beach experiences, mentioning Bob Saget and Stephen Lynch's performances. Listener-submitted photos and videos were also discussed.

A call from Marge of the Little Shelter animal shelter requesting Viagra for a dog with heart problems sparked a wildly inappropriate and sexually charged conversation. This involved jokes about Bob Dole, accusations of questionable practices at the shelter (including euthanasia), and a debate with a caller, Jim, disputing Marge's claims.  Other topics in this segment included a picture of a naked man with large breasts, the Duke lacrosse case and Mike Nifong's disbarment, a Ferrari crash, Paul McCartney's perceived lack of originality (with audio clips played), and a rambling bit with a hot dog truck owner.  The segment concluded with show promotion and a mention of *Live Free or Die Hard*'s premiere.

The show continued with a discussion about promoting *Live Free or Die Hard*, the hosts' frustration with not getting Bruce Willis but Willis Drummond instead, and suggestive commentary by Jimmy Norton about a topless woman applying lotion. They then discussed *Fantastic Four*'s box office success and their upcoming guest, Sir Ben Kingsley, leading to a comedic, rambling segment about his filmography, particularly a humorous misunderstanding of *Schindler's List*.  Studio producer Roland participated in this segment.  

Several "feel-good" news stories followed: a 73-year-old failing high school exams after 39 attempts, a grandmother earning her GED, and a toddler accidentally given a margarita.  The hosts also used a British TV reporter's terrified roller coaster audio for comedic effect.  They then discussed their recent suspension and return, their new studio, and an update on "Bear," a listener who won a Father's Day contest for a Bunny Ranch visit,  followed by Bear's enthusiastic (and crude) call-in update. A *USA Today* article about shackling juveniles sparked a debate on the practice.  A call from Julie from Wisconsin, who believed E-Rock promised her a studio visit, led to jokes about her appearance and weight, culminating in her invitation to the studio. The segment ended with discussion of the show's internet stream and airing on K-Rock, along with off-topic banter.

A further segment involved a crude and sexually suggestive conversation with "Ja-Ja Julie" from Wisconsin, featuring numerous jokes about her weight, comparing her size to various animals.  Her past abusive relationship was mentioned, with her ex-boyfriend allegedly emotionally abusing her by calling her fat.  The conversation then shifted to her love of roller coasters (83 parks, over 300 rides).  The segment included playing and guessing audio clips, a vulgar discussion about milk and other bodily functions, and Julie singing "Dream On" acapella and an unsuccessful attempt at "Chubby Bunny."  The segment concluded with chatter about moving and the hosts' personal lives.

The show included a chaotic and highly vulgar "Pot Talk Monday" discussion, with overwhelming listener support for its continuation. This included a graphic and offensive rant about animals, their defecation habits, and killing them (particularly bears), using extremely offensive language.  A trucker hauling cow lips called in, leading to further vulgar tangents.  The hosts shared disgusting experiences, including eating chicken assholes.  An Ohio listener was criticized for their negative opinion of "Pot Talk Monday," and a recurring joke involved moose semen used in sexually suggestive and offensive contexts. The show ended with a discussion of scheduling and the introduction of new segments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Josh, Josh, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their audience.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good. 
[00:00:30]  Go, screw!  Radio badboys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talkshow radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock shots, Opie and Anthony.  Charles Nelson-Riley takes it up a blank.  The blank.  Can I call a friend and maybe get some aid with this?  Oh, boy.  This is where entertainment is going. 
[00:01:00]  I'm starting to suspect my parents are swingers.  I think your dad's just a watcher.  He just sits in the corner nude.  And also, it's a horrific thing.  I think to your mom, they are sick.  Free.  Don't you ever do that.  I understand the concept of the syllable.  You don't have to beat it into me with your belt.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Thud, thud, thud.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hi.  What's going on?  Not my pal talk, camera.  I don't know what the problem is.  And it sounds a little different in the headphones.  Yeah, someone screws with things.  I think there's people that just have to justify their jobs. 
[00:02:00]  So they come in during the weekend or something and just mess with things.  They turn some knobs and screws and whatnot.  Maybe just hit that.  Press it together, E-Rock.  Oh, did the head fall off?  Couldn't you have just gone like that?  There we go.  Don't mind us.  We are just fixing.  That's perfect. 
[00:02:30]  Why do things have to change?  There's no one else using the studio at this point, right?  No.  Seems like there's a lot of fiddling that goes on when we leave.  People are fiddling with things.  Stop fiddling.  I think Tom comes in at night and does his own radio show and then just tape records it and listens to it on the way home.  I'm good.  He calls up the Tom show.  I don't know what's going on.  My voice sounds a little weird, Tim.  It might be because I lost my voice the last couple of days, but I don't know. 
[00:03:00]  Who knows?  We'll just plow through and figure it out as we go along here.  I did one of those deals where I was trying to clear my throat first thing yesterday morning.  I wake up and it came out like, you ever try to get a good, when you wake up and it goes, just ravaged us like a, like a scratchy freaking train.  Nothing's coming out.  You try to talk it like, the first thing you have to do is brush your teeth like a thousand times because I just had like booze up too late morning breath. 
[00:03:30]  Yuck.  Horrible.  Yuck.  Good time though.  Good goddamn time.  Yeah.  Well, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show officially.  I think we got everything ready.  Ready to broadcast?  Yeah.  All right.  It's 877-212-5762.  Of course, we want to take a lot of phone calls from the ONA Charlie and Vyras comedy tour that we did at Jones Beach. 
[00:04:00]  I started losing my voice Friday.  After we left here, we continued our show and it was just an all-out brawl basically, an all-out roast.  Mm-hmm.  We decided to play our first show that Anthony and I ever did together.  Well, that might have been why my voice was shot too.  And then we had all the comedians that were at Jones Beach, most of them come in and just roast the hell out of us.  Yeah.  They ragged us really bad and then they just turned on each other, which was good because it got us out of the barrel for a while. 
[00:04:30]  And the point I'm trying to make is I lost my voice on Friday because you're yelling and screaming to try to get in there.  You're trying to defend yourself.  You're trying to beat someone else up vocally.  And then Saturday at Jones Beach, yelling and screaming on stage.  Yep.  And here we are today.  And nobody planned on roasting.  It's just like we were sitting there just sitting around, screwing around.  And Ope pulled out that thing and goes, well, we got this.  And I never thought you'd put it in.  And then for an hour and 40 minutes, everyone just – but then again, it's like a bunch of wolverines. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Nobody can stay focused.  As soon as stupid Bob Kelly would slip up or rotten little Hans Voss, I mean, you have to attack them.  Then they just got attacked, yeah, by everybody.  They couldn't stay focused on just bashing on me and Opie.  It was our tape from the first show we ever, ever did back – I don't even know how many years ago.  94, 95, somewhere in there.  Yeah.  And out at BAB on Long Island.  And I am so completely embarrassed by it. 
[00:05:30]  I cannot listen to it without cringing.  Because, again, I'm just this happy to be there, mush, love everything that's going on, laughing too hard at things,  trying too hard to make voices and do – just like throw everything in in 10 minutes.  Were you trying to be Radio Gold?  I was trying so hard to be Radio Gold, Jimmy, just so I wouldn't have to work another day in my life in construction.  And I listened back to it.  And then you guys just ragging – oh, it was awful. 
[00:06:00]  And Opie was, you know, he added in a lot of things between the music,  but you also had to play music and front and back sell songs and stuff.  And it was just hearing you doing things like,  102% Long Island.  Yeah.  We like to thank Hop Pong for showing the world they love rock and roll.  Yeah.  And then they just stopped – you would stop the tape, and everybody would just be like,  and there was a full studio audience in, also there to just razz us. 
[00:06:30]  It was very embarrassing, but a lot of fun.  Well, we're going to have round two.  I think we're going to do that type of show every Friday before, you know, another virus date.  Have somebody bring in one of their first stand-up performances.  That'll happen a week from Friday.  Round two.  We did mine back at NEW.  We did Awful Vosses.  Patrice was going to bring his in, but then something happened.  Yeah.  Which put the show on hiatus.  Oh, right.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That was going to happen before that, huh? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  And then it was just kind of –  All right.  Well, maybe Patrice brings in one of his tapes from the old days, and we'll have at it with him.  Do you know my girlfriend I tried to watch – I have my stand-up reel,  and I tried to watch some of my stuff.  I can watch my stuff from six months in because I was just awful.  But when I was doing like a little character, my first TV set was Friday night videos, and  I was just like this quirky guy, you know, what's this nut going to say?  Oh, no.  And –  Were your mannerisms all like that?  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  They were like too big, and like I – somebody should have executed me.  I literally should have been shot.  But I remember my opening line was, I feel sexy.  Oh, and you said it like that?  Yeah.  Like just –  And you put your little hands on your hips?  I watched it.  I – if there was footage of me and another man rolling around nude, I would rather watch that  with a group of people.  Well, we're going to do that again a week from Friday.  We'll have at it. 
[00:08:00]  Sounds like you were trying to do some kind of Urkel thing.  It wasn't – it was just like this likable thing.  I want it to be likable.  Yeah.  I want it to have like a fun energy.  Oh, I was a tool personified.  I was awful.  That stinks.  All right.  So I listen to your guys' old stuff, and I'm like, you know what?  You were a little eager, and you were back selling songs like a little DJ, but there's  nothing as humiliating as being on television going, I feel sexy, sexy.  Just a quirky guy, folks.  Get out of the way.  Quirky guy coming through. 
[00:08:30]  Wait till I bring in an air check from CQ102, Hit Music, and more.  That I got to hear, too.  From Geneva, New York back in, I don't know, 1989, maybe, 88, somewhere in there.  And I could also bring in my solo messes, which are some horrific power ballads.  Yeah.  That are just so bad.  All right.  Well, enough of that.  The only reason I brought that up was because I lost my voice starting Friday and then Saturday  at Jones Beach, and we'll do round two of this a week from Friday. 
[00:09:00]  But first of all, we want to thank everyone that made it out to Jones Beach on Saturday  for the, I guess, the first official date of the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.  We did one, a little warm-up gig in Vegas that went very well.  But now we're rolling out the tour, and so far, so good, man.  And close to 10,000 people at Jones Beach on Saturday.  Yeah, it was great.  It looked like everyone had a really, really good time.  I was sitting backstage just before Lynch went on going, man, we're over three hours into  this show, and people are still laughing their asses off. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  And they were just freaking screaming for them.  And then Stephen Lynch finished strong, and people gave, like, a standing ovation.  And it was, like, it was unbelievable.  Because a lot of these people, I'm looking at instant feedback, they got there at noon,  one in the afternoon, we didn't get out of there until midnight.  Yep.  Midnight.  They were out there in the parking lot partying.  We went for a little drive-thru.  The parking lot saw a lot of stuff going on out there.  Oh, my God.  One sight I shan't forget. 
[00:10:00]  Who the hell was the naked guy?  Oh, my God.  Was that hilarious?  He's just standing on top of his truck.  Right.  He's got no pants or underwear on.  And he's got, like, a T-shirt on, but he's pulling it up to his chest and just standing  there, completely naked, junk in the breeze.  Just waiting for us to notice.  Well, we were on the back of a pickup truck, just kind of checking out the tailgating in 
[00:10:30]  the parking lot.  We were going, you know, row by row and just signing and throwing out T-shirts and taking  pictures and looking at the festivities, drinking a few beers with the listeners.  And, yeah, this guy was on top of his truck, just pulling up his shirt, nothing on below.  Yep.  And the whole place lost it.  We were trying to show that on the big video screen during the concert, but I guess there's  some rules about nudity.  Is there?  Unfortunately.  There was a state park. 
[00:11:00]  They didn't even serve alcohol there, which is what made all of our jobs easier.  That's why they were so attentive at 10 o'clock at night, boozing in the parking lot.  They were hungover.  Yeah, they didn't want anything loud to happen, so heckling is loud.  It was a bummer, too, man.  I mean, there's always someone that has to wreck your fun.  We're in the back of a pickup truck.  We're going row by row.  We got cops on us, you know, making sure everything is cool.  And then the police, what were they? 
[00:11:30]  They're park rangers.  They were park rangers.  Had to, like, not only stop the pickup truck, tell us that we can't be in the back anymore,  and, matter of fact, we should just go back to the venue.  I'm like, you guys suck.  Freaking buzz kills.  Ranger Smith.  What do you expect them to do?  Their whole job is to make sure you're not throwing jelly where the bees can get to it.  They're not catching criminals.  They're catching guys in the park peeking at each other at 3 o'clock in the morning.  Kill joys.  She had George Michael four times.  But this was a big bust for them. 
[00:12:00]  They talked about this.  They're in the back of the station wagon.  What happened, Sarge?  And we had two cops, and they tried to talk to them, and they were like,  we have authority here, and we're going to show it.  It was like, come on, man.  It was completely under control.  That was the only way we could do the parking lot, because, first of all, it was huge.  Second of all, it gets a little crazy.  It gets crazy by the truck, people.  They want things signed.  They want to, you know, throw you a beer.  A lot of stuff going on.  But they had to stop us. 
[00:12:30]  They'd throw their lights on a little bit.  Like, what are you doing, man?  Do you understand?  No one.  They have no stories to tell.  No.  No one ever yells, oh, my God, get a park ranger.  Never.  Call the park rangers.  Unless a bear has made off with your picnic basket.  Picnic basket.  Unless that happens.  Then you get one of those dopes.  So we only did about half the parking lot, unfortunately.  You know, but the people we met out there, they were great.  They were barbecuing, and they got the tunes cranking. 
[00:13:00]  They had all sorts of, like, stuff set up that had something to do with the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  The flamethrowing guy was awesome.  Yeah.  Fire-breathing guy, I guess we should call him.  Fire-breather.  Yeah.  That was pretty cool.  I went out later, though.  I went out a little before showtime to the, I guess, the whack bag section and hung out with those guys for a while.  And my relatives were all hanging out with them, taking pictures.  People wanted pictures with Sal. 
[00:13:30]  Sal was there.  Ro, they're taking pictures of me.  And my mom out there and relatives.  And they're all hanging out, and everybody was really cool, taking a bunch of pictures.  It was a great time in the parking lot.  People just partying.  And then came into the venue, showing off great.  A couple little glitches.  Yeah, a few.  A few.  Technical glitches.  Honestly, not bad.  Wow.  Everyone backstage was saying it was the best show thus far.  So, I mean, the comedians all were on. 
[00:14:00]  Apparently, we had a good little thing we wanted to do on the big screen from the dressing room.  Yeah.  And the nasty old son itself put the kibosh on that because it put such a glare on the screen no one could see.  Well, they wanted us to say hi to the crowd from backstage before we made our grand appearance or whatever.  Our big appearance.  Our grand entrance.  And we come up with a very funny visual bit, and no one was smart enough to say, well, maybe you shouldn't do a visual bit from backstage because the sun is still glaring onto the screen, and no one's going to see anything you do backstage. 
[00:14:30]  They're only going to be able to hear your voices.  Yeah.  So, there was a couple points where I'm like, why isn't anyone laughing?  This should be really funny.  Bob Saget is now speaking into a microphone that Opie has positioned so it looks like a part of his manhood.  Right, right, right.  It was a huge visual that would have got a big laugh if you could see it, and no one's laughing, so now we're like heating up like, why aren't they laughing? 
[00:15:00]  And then we find out, you know, someone comes running in and goes, that was great, guys, but they couldn't see it.  They couldn't see it, but it was great.  Because the sun is still, you know, taking out the screen.  I mean, I'm like, oh, great, why don't you tell us that ahead of time?  Oops.  That was a great venue, though.  Jones Beach.  Yeah.  That was one of the best crowds I've ever performed for.  They were fantastic from beginning to end.  It was amazing.  Yep.  I'm trying to remember everything that happened. 
[00:15:30]  Good luck.  I know someone got, only one person, like, misbehaved during Louis C.K. set, and he was way in the back.  He was probably just drunk.  And he got thrown out, I guess, and the place went nuts.  They started cheering.  And then rumor has it the guy tried to swim back into the venue.  Yeah.  The place is, like, surrounded by a moat.  Right.  Pretty much.  So they kick him out, and he figures, all right, if I could get in the water over there, then I could swim back to the venue.  And I guess he attempted to swim back into the venue.  And they kind of caught him, and last he was seen being escorted out, soaking wet. 
[00:16:00]  They should just let you heckle if you're going to swim back to the venue.  If you get thrown out and then swim back to a venue, it should be a lot of difficult.  And don't drown after, you know, because he was probably intoxicated.  Yeah, I imagine he had a few.  Let's go to the phones.  877-212-5762.  It's TJ on Long Island.  What's up, TJ?  Hey.  What's up, guys?  Great show, Saturday.  Great show.  Thanks. 
[00:16:30]  Dike show.  Did you see that one tailgate party that was right by the K-Rock that had all the props and the festivities and the costumes?  Yeah.  That was one of the most insane things I've ever seen in my life.  Wait.  Explain for people, because, you know, they're listening all over the country right now.  Well, there was, like, a group of about 15 guys.  You know, they invited me over to party because I was there by myself.  And, you know, we were hanging out.  They whipped out.  They had a blow-up doll that they dressed in a velour jumpsuit.  Velour jumpsuit.  Nice.  With an Al Sharpton mask. 
[00:17:00]  Really?  And on one of the signs, it said, have your picture taken with the Reverend Al Sharpton.  And Rich Voss was going around doing the MySpace video.  I get the live feed from MySpace.  Yeah, MySpace is really helping us out with this tour.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Voss wouldn't go within 10 feet of this thing.  And it was absolutely.  I don't want to get in trouble.  He stayed away from that thing like it had the AIDS virus.  Oh, I see it now, man.  Oh, my God. 
[00:17:30]  Of course he stayed 10 feet away from that.  Oh, my.  Take your photo with the Reverend Al Sharpton.  Oh, my God.  They got him in the old school tracksuit and other things I don't feel like describing right now.  I actually like the picture I see of me photoshopped into various Nazi attire.  Yeah.  That was a lovely little poster that was up.  Well, the other neat thing about that was they had Jimmy Norton. 
[00:18:00]  Norton, you killed, by the way.  Fantastic job.  Thank you, mister.  They had you photoshopped into various X-rated photographs.  Oh, I'd love to see that.  With like X-rated.  Sure, it was photoshopped.  Well, there you go.  There it is right there.  I saw pictures from the virus tour.  I wore an Aussie shirt on stage, and it was much more wrinkled than I realized.  Did you know how you're fucking out yourself?  What a bum I look like.  I saw these pictures.  I'm like, who is this frumpy old bum?  Oh, it's me. 
[00:18:30]  I can't believe I went on stage like that, but I didn't realize this shirt was wrinkled.  But, man, those lights really don't forgive at all.  Like, the bottom of it, it looks like I just woke up in that shirt.  I had to change my shirt because I had kerosene all over the one I was wearing that I was going to wear.  The fire-breathing guy.  The fire-breathing guy started breathing his fire, and we're in the back of the pickup,  and there was a nice gust of wind blowing all the kerosene right into my face and on my shirt.  I get backstage, and there's just kerosene dots all over my shirt. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, we looked and said, what's that?  Oh, no, fire-breathing guy soaked Opie.  I thought it was part of the shirt, and realized, no, it's not.  E-Rock, we got a lot of photos going up, huh?  Already up.  Yeah, we got tons of photos from the ONA traveling virus out there in Jones Beach.  Just go to the website, and you can check out a lot of the fun that was had.  All right, we'll take a break, and we'll go back to the phones after a little break here.  The phones are lit, but once again, I want to say thank you to everyone that made it out to Jones Beach this past Saturday.

Holy mackerel.  Jimmy. 
[00:20:30]  Yes, sir.  You're killed.  Thank you, man.  Thank you.  A basset hound with a coal miner's hat?  Where did you get that from?  Oh, the, uh, my, I keep wrapping for the radio.  Let's just say it's a, it's a genital description.  I got that from my own, my own wants and desires, sir.  I appreciate you enjoying it.  Yeah, you guys really killed, man.  We started drinking at 3 o'clock in the afternoon and we never looked back.  Nice.  Thank you guys for a great weekend.  Yeah, it was absolutely a great time.  Thanks, Kenny.  Let's go to Nick on Long Island. 
[00:21:00]  How good is that stupid Lynch's voice?  That bastard should have a regular song out.  I know.  His voice is, it annoys me.  He sings like an angel.  He really does, man.  He sings like an angel.  Yeah.  It's good.  His voice.  It's good that he's back with the show, too.  I honestly.  We haven't had him around in a long time.  I turn into a sissy when he's singing.  I really, I'm swooning.  I'm fanning myself.  Like a Bobby Soxer with Sinatra.  He's a talented guy.  It really bothers me.  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  Good looking, talented.  Good looking popular.  Nick, what's going on, buddy?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Olive oil voice and guinea charm.  David Lynch doesn't get that seat in rehab.  Oh, he's a drunk.  Yes, Nick.  Sorry.  That cartoon that you guys put up on the screen over at George Beech?  Yes.  Yeah.  Jimmy Norton?  Yes.  That is the most disturbing thing I've ever seen. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, don't say what it is, though.  The 12-year-old boy.  The what?  Oh, is that?  It looks like a little 12-year-old boy on the couch.  The cartoon?  Wow, you guys suck today.  I don't know what he's talking about.  We're tired, and obviously the listeners are tired, too, man.  Whatever the cartoon.  How many cartoons did they show?  We had a bunch of stuff.  Was it when we were talking about being cartoon characters?  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  That might have helped, considering we've had a lot of stuff up there.  I did look like a little 12-year-old boy.  Yeah, that was funny.  I couldn't hear the audio on that one, though. 
[00:22:30]  But I've got to give props to Coke Logic from Chicago.  He did the one.  Let's just say there's a story from my youth where I do a few things with my friends that we shouldn't have been doing.  And that was animated by Coke Logic.  That is hysterical.  I got some good laughs, and that was a great job by him.  Yeah.  He's a mess from Chicago.  He's a mess.  I met him.  He's just every one of our fans.  He's really did a great job, man.  He's also...  All right, let's go to Pat. 
[00:23:00]  Pat, what's up?  Oh, man, Jim Norton, you are the craziest man I ever seen, man.  That CD, I picked up your CD after the show.  I laughed all the way home.  I thought my head was going to pop off.  Oh, thank you, man.  That's a crazy show.  And that Bob Saget, I never saw him live beside them stupid shows he did.  Oh, my God, he's sick in his mind.  Yeah, he's a dirty boy.  Them stupid shows.  There you go, guys.  Thank you, man.  And you saw the real Bob Saget.  He's been...  You know, the joke's been on America for many, many years.  He's actually a really dirty guy, but he got into this family programming for, what, decades? 
[00:23:30]  Yep.  And now he's back to his roots being just a really filthy comic.  I just love the fact that when he plays somebody...  Oh, well, whatever.  He was so all over the place, man.  He was so all over the place.  He's crazy.  Kind of like your phone call.  I just...  I actually spit.  All right.  Oh, I didn't fit.  I'm sorry.  I was just going to say that I love the fact that...  The Saget really does get nuts.  Shut up.  I love the rubes that probably go to see him when they're in their town, thinking they're 
[00:24:00]  going to see the full house guy.  Yeah.  And just, I could imagine the horror when they see him up on stage just spewing this dreck  and have to leave the venue.  Or maybe they even bring the kids.  This is the most disturbing thing I've ever had to say on radio, but I've been corrected  by E-Rock.  It says CokeLogic did the intro.  The other cartoons were done by a kid named Nelson. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, really?  A cartoon of me and my friends?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, whatever.  Whoever did it was great.  All right.  Nelson and CokeLogic, apparently an alternative couple from Chicago, did a wonderful job.  Thanks, E-Rock, for just humiliating me.  It wasn't like the credits rolled at the end and we knew.  Exactly.  What are we supposed to know?  I was like, I'm just a boy.  Dopes.  Let's say hi to Rich Voss.  Rich.  Hey, what's going on?  There's Rich.  One of the nine comedians that hit that stage at Jones Beach over the weekend.  What's up, Rich?  What's going on?  I drove home.  I had no voice, like you said. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, my voice is still shot.  We were walking around the parking lot earlier with MySpace doing interviews and stuff.  And I did go past that booth with Al Sharder.  I said, take a picture.  I go, look, I barely have a career.  This could end it.  And then the fire breather also, too, spit kerosene or gasoline all over me.  And I thought I was going to catch on fire and have to drop and roll or whatever.  One thing, Rich, you should know this with your career.  You're never going to catch on fire. 
[00:25:30]  For a minute, I thought they were totally bombed.  That was pretty good.  That was pretty funny.  Yeah, the fire breather was messing up everybody's wardrobes, man.  What the hell?  It was a little windy in that parking lot.  And he didn't figure out the wind before he decided to do that little gag.  I want to see a variety show in the parking lot.  Variety show?  There really are a bunch of kooks out there, though.  It was like the Catskills in the parking lot.  There was all sorts of crazy, whoa, what are you pointing at? 
[00:26:00]  Just a girl, but she's close.  What?  Nothing.  I was pointing at the girl with clothes on in the window.  I thought she was nude.  It's pointing at the girl with clothes on at the window Monday.  Yes.  Yeah, but you're right.  It was like a variety show.  America's Got Talent.  Right there in the parking lot at Jones Beach.  That audience was so good.  It was just right from the beginning when I walked out.  It was so much fun last night.  Last night, yesterday's show was the first show I didn't have to take any anxiety medicine.  Oh.  Yeah, they were great, man.  You killed.  Well, someone's beating me up because they're like, it was the best show yet. 
[00:26:30]  It was the first one.  No, I'm talking about It Beats Vegas, which we did before this about a month, two months ago,  and also all the shows last year.  The Jones Beach show is the best virus show we've done so far.  I think so.  Yeah, they were, it was just, the crowd was just on fire.  And, you know, it was funny, the wheelchair section, I was trashing them.  They were having a good time.  I didn't even know there was a wheelchair section.  Yeah, to the right and the left.  I went on the ones, went after the ones on the right. 
[00:27:00]  Why?  The ones on the left looked a little too tough for you.  Too healthy.  They were only paralyzed below the waist.  Right.  He wanted to go from the neck down.  They can't hurt you if they have to blow in a tube to move.  We had a contest down at the parking lot.  I said, you know, who would do something crazy to get backstage?  So there's one guy, and I'll do this.  So, you know, explain that right.  He said, you know, I'll get undressed and I'll run across the parking lot.  And he did, it was, listen to me.  Oh, completely naked.  Completely. 
[00:27:30]  I mean, this guy, this guy made Norton look like Adonis if he was naked.  He was an insult.  And listen, I have small body parts, my fingers, you know, you've talked about it.  Everything, your intellect.  Your pea brain.  Come on, let's go.  It was, it's like he just came out of water, okay, and someone had a butcher knife.  It was the most embarrassing thing. 
[00:28:00]  Carpenter, we've got a guard.  No.  No.  Oh, my.  I'd tell you something.  How does that not go in?  For some reason, I feel like you're making fun of me.  Back goes Griffey looking up.  And it's out of here.  Or is it?  No, it's all for wrong.  My mistake.  Well, this is worth getting up at 6 a.m. for. 
[00:28:30]  I've made an ass of myself.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  I was only joking.  You got it right.  There it is.  Yes or no?  Oh, you added an extra E.  I think we got another station cut in on this.  Yeah, it must be it, Rich.  Yeah, this station. 
[00:29:00]  That's what it is.  That's the best part of a bomb is there's 40 clips now.  I know.  And we got to run through all of them because we still love every single one of them.  Yeah, they're all gems.  So, boss, basically a guy was running around the parking lot so he could get backstage and  he wasn't packing much and everyone laughed and pointed and it was very embarrassing for  everyone.  Wow.  How did you get that out so fast?  Geez, that's all.  I mean, it doesn't have to take 10 minutes to get that story out.  It's true, but I don't know.  I like the details.  Rich was trying to find an FCC friendly way. 
[00:29:30]  I respect that, but his way, he was like, well, the guy acted like he, picture a guy  at a high altitude who suffered through a bad film.  What are you talking about?  I got to tell you, the tailgating is becoming huge as far as these comedy shows go.  I mean, they're getting really, really creative out there, though.  It's a whole experience.  That's what we've been telling people.  It's not just, you know, you go there and see a bunch of comedians and then leave.  It's a whole experience, the tailgating, the village, and then the show itself. 
[00:30:00]  But the tailgating itself, it's so much fun to walk around the parking lot or drive around  the parking lot.  Yeah.  And you can't wait to see the next thing.  Yeah.  You know, because there's always some creative thing that's going on out there.  Yep.  So, Rich, you did a great job, man.  It was a lot of fun, huh?  Yeah, it was a lot.  I can't wait to the next one.  You know, what's that?  The next one's where?  Mahegan's on?  Yeah, two weeks.  Two weeks.  A week from this Saturday.  Yeah, whatever.  The 30th.  Is it a Friday or Saturday?  It's a Saturday.  So, a week from this coming Saturday. 
[00:30:30]  So, yeah, a little under two weeks.  That's my birthday, you know.  Well, we'll have to bring a birthday cake out on stage for you.  How old are you going to be?  How old am I going to be?  Very.  Honestly, how old?  50.  The big 5-0 for Rich Voss?  What's that?  Are you really going to be 50?  Yeah, I'm just 30.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  I shouldn't say that.  It might hurt my career.  Well, how can it?  How can it?  What?  What?  48 is going to help?  I do.  Oh, he's perfect for the parts.  What?  He's 50?  The only way you could match up, like, if you wanted to say, like, I can't believe he's 
[00:31:00]  that dumb at that age.  Yeah.  You should start saying you're 13.  Well, here's the deal.  I'm going to go play golf right now since I'm up this road.  I had, listen to me.  It was great.  Everybody.  Oh, no.  Let's say hi to Eric.  Eric, you're on the O.P.  and Anthony show.  What's up?  He's got to be laughing right now looking at his phone.  You rock.  I wanted to say you guys rock Saturday night, man.  The show was awesome.  George and Otto.  The whole thing was great.  George and Otto.  George and Otto.  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  Saget Bob was good.  Otto and George got rave reviews on the fan sites.  People were losing their minds seeing Otto and George.  Otto is a machine.  And he's been stepping up for this tour big time.  Yeah.  I was watching Otto last night, and he's one of my oldest friends in the business.  I know Otto 15 years.  And just watching him murder in front of all those thousands of people.  Yeah.  Like, this is what he does.  It's great to see, man.  He's just great.  Hysterical. 
[00:32:00]  Was Otto and George your favorite, Eric?  Excuse me?  Was he your favorite?  Bob Saget.  Bob Saget?  You enjoyed Saget?  I think a lot of people enjoyed Bob Saget because they're just shocked that he's that dirty.  It was awesome.  Awesome show.  Great time, man.  I hope I see you guys at my weekend son on the 30th.  Yeah.  It's kind of weird, but I think a lot of the faithful listeners especially, they're going  to multiple shows on this tour.  So, right on, Eric.  Thanks for showing up.  Thank you. 
[00:32:30]  I'm sorry, but the lineups changed a little bit, too.  You got a different act here, a different act there.  Well, Mohegan Sun, June 30th.  It's Bob Kelly, Bob Saget, Frank Caliendo, Jim Norton, Louis C.K., Otto and George, Patrice  O'Neal, Rich Voss.  That looks like the same lineup, right?  Except for Stephen Lynch?  Yeah.  Okay, so the lineups don't necessarily do that.  Not every time, no.  They do.  They do vary depending on what date.  So, tickets still available through Ticketmaster.com for Mohegan Sun, the next stop on this tour.  I want to do something in Connecticut, too, if we can get up there. 
[00:33:00]  I would love to.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think we're going to try to get up there a day early, or maybe two days early  and broadcast up there.  I would love to.  Hang in the casino.  Absolutely.  I love the casino gigs.  They cost me money when I'm leaving with less money.  Oh, boy, believe me.  They see you coming.  They're like, pay that sucker, whatever he wants.  That's why they give big contracts in casinos.  They know the artists will give it right back.  It's all coming back.  Izzy, Jersey, what's up?  Wow, guys.  Amazing, amazing show from the Cal game, from the parking lot.  You get there, people barbecuing, drinking beers, listening to the game. 
[00:33:30]  Everything was amazing.  Jimmy frigging killed in about a second.  Wow.  Thank you, man.  But it sucked to me, Frank Kelly, though.  Everybody started booing him.  That kind of sucked.  He didn't get booed by Cal.  Frank had a decent set.  He didn't get booed by everybody.  He had a few of them, but Frank handled it like he was like, go ahead.  He just didn't really care, and he just barreled through what he was doing.  And then he would get some laughs.  Then a few people gave him a hard time.  But it wasn't like he had a total death set.  I kind of tuned in when I heard that. 
[00:34:00]  I heard a little bit, and Frank's a pro, man.  He didn't get thrown by it.  He came back.  He's like, ah, I'm surprised I had that much fun with it.  He wasn't bent out of shape about it.  Yeah, he turned around a little bit, but there you go, Izzy.  And Louie C.K.  Cole and his daughter C and Stace.  That was great.  Louie's great.  Yeah, Louie's amazing.  Louie is great.  I mean, we're really, really psyched about the lineup this year, man.  Well, we were last year.  I'm not, you know.  But, I mean, Jones Beach was just amazing from beginning to end.  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  All right.  Oh, we are going to do a live show from the Wolf the Friday before the Mohegan Sun date.  All right.  Very, very cool.  Oh, nice.  Let's say hi to Sonny Ferelli.  He drove down from Boston just for the show.  Sonny Ferelli, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, man.  A little tired today, but doing well.  Yeah, it was an awesome show.  I'll tell you, there's a rumor going out that you're going to have a special appearance  by a special guest at the Boston show.  Hmm. 
[00:35:00]  Really?  Hmm.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh.  Ah.  Ah.  Yeah, something like a Boston favorite or something.  I don't know.  That's what I heard anyways.  Ah, you never know.  We have some tricks up our sleeves.  Let's just put it that way.  Well, listen, the tailgating party was absolutely phenomenal.  I had Big A was out there, and I put him on the back of my motorcycle.  For people that don't really know, I mean, I'm already kind of like a big guy, you know, 
[00:35:30]  and Big A is about five times bigger than I am.  Yeah.  It took him literally about five minutes to sit on the back of my bike.  It was the funniest thing to see him come and mount my bike, you know?  He's like, he's trying to put the foot over the bike and stuff.  Oh, was that you and him?  I saw it.  Oh, there's a woman lotioning her bosoms.  Wow, those are nice.  Well, there's a girl on Pal Talk.  Is that Renee's Vengeance?  And it looks like she's wearing a bikini top, but she's not. 
[00:36:00]  Those are massive tan lines that she's lotioning up.  Do you know I'm across the room, and I recognize her hairdo?  You know her?  I've just seen her on Pal Talk.  That's what a pervert I am.  I knew her screen name from her hairdo across the room.  I really need a sexual rehab.  Well, she's topless, and she's lotioning up.  It looks like she got a bit of a sunburn over the weekend.  Little sun.  She got a little sun.  You can see where the bikini top used to be.  But, Sonny, you like the show, huh?  Oh, yeah.  It was great.  It was great.  Yeah, the tailgating is definitely becoming the thing to do. 
[00:36:30]  Absolutely.  Yeah, I think maybe we get some sort of poker game organized for the Mohegan Sun tour there.  Yeah, maybe there, Sonny.  All right.  Enough of Sonny's phone call.  I like Sonny.  It was good seeing him.  Was it?  I don't know.  I don't know what else to say.  Was it really?  Just trying to make something out of that phone call?  Well, I don't know.  Because we were going down aisle after aisle after aisle in the parking lot, and I thought 
[00:37:00]  we were just going down the same aisle.  It was the same people.  Does Alec Baldwin have anything to say about Sonny's phone call?  I'm not sure he might.  What?  No.  Oh.  No?  My favorite clip.  I've made an ass of myself.  God, I think that's Alec.  By the way, we want to thank the gang at Gentleman's Quarters in Baldwin.  Oh, yeah.  I hope Tom's okay with this. 
[00:37:30]  They were doing the shadow dancing.  Yep.  And then they were also like, you know, they were live girls on the stage as well.  Yeah.  We had to find a strip club at the last possible minute.  They were hot, too.  And they were smoking.  They were great.  Great girls.  I was with my broad, and I'm walking in the back, and I look at them.  I see them on a dressing with all these hot strippers, and I have to go like, ah, that's  tacky.  I don't enjoy those girls.  Yeah.  And now the girl is showing her hiney on Pal Talk.  I miss her.  Disturbing all of us. 
[00:38:00]  Well, she could do it for you there.  Did you notice, too, a lot of girls coming to the show?  A lot of girls were at the show.  That was something that's kind of, it's new for us.  Yeah, it's nice to see some women, finally.  Some girls.  All right.  We're going to take a break and regroup.  We've got things to do today, but as you can tell, the show was a huge success.  Very, very happy.  Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves out there at Jones Beach.  Don't forget, June 30th, Mohegan Sun.  That's the next stop on the tour, and you can get your tickets through Ticketmaster.com. 
[00:38:30]  You can go to VirusTour, one word on MySpace for all the updates on the tour, okay?  Right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hi, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  If you're just joining us, phone number 877-212-5762.  You're listening to a very interactive radio show.  Give us a call if you got something.  Also, we got the instant feedback.  You can get to that through our website.  We got the PowTalk cameras in studio. 
[00:39:00]  We're looking at our listeners as they listen to the radio show this morning.  Early in the morning.  You get to watch them start their day from bed to getting up to maybe showering, getting  dressed, or just sitting around nude.  Got a few nudes this morning.  Nude on the computer.  Yeah.  People love being naked in front of their computer.  Oh, there she goes.  Now, she's completely naked.  She just took her little panties off and naked. 
[00:39:30]  And she walks out of the room.  By the way, Barry Bonds hit a homer yesterday.  What was it?  Tim Wakefield?  That's Wakefield.  I could have bunted that ball out.  Stupid Wakefield.  Should have his arm cut off.  Barry Bonds hasn't hit a homer in like two months, something like that.  And Tim Wakefield threw one of his lob pitches.  Just like an underhanded softball pitch.  Amazing.  I hate knuckleballers.  Oh, so do I.  And a whack.  Isn't he the last one?  We finally get rid of that pitch in baseball. 
[00:40:00]  You either look silly missing it, or a guy hits it into the parking lot of the BJs next  to the stadium.  Right.  Yeah, there's no gray area.  It's either like a monstrous homerun, or you just miss the ball by eight feet.  A knuckleballer, he either throws a two-hitter, or he loses.  Forty-seven to one.  Knuckleballers are dopes.  The stupid catcher has to have an oversized myth. 
[00:40:30]  Everyone is uncomfortable.  Just get rid of the pitch.  Make it illegal.  Nobody knows where it's going.  It just dips and dives.  Guy goes from first to home.  The guy threw it.  It's stuck in the fence.  Yeah, all of a sudden you're ducking.  You're just trying to enjoy the game.  You're ducking in the stands.  That's great.  That's so true.  And they never wind up knuckleballers.  They're such tentative little men.  They just step back once, and they throw it.  They're kind of like girls when they throw it.  It's a girl throw.  Yeah.  And then you hear, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, as it's just making its way to 
[00:41:00]  the plate.  Yeah, it looks like bad graphics, like from a UFO, like a man on a string, like dipping  and diving.  The old gypsy doodle knuckleball.  Oh, enough with that stupid Wakefield.  He either strikes out 21 or gives up 80 homers.  It's either strikeout after strikeout, or they have to yank him with one out in the  first.  Right.  Because he's a bum who can't get anybody out.  They can yank him in the first. 
[00:41:30]  He coughed one up.  Barry Bonds, how far away now?  How many more does he need?  Yeah, who cares?  He's a cheater.  Six?  Seven?  A cheater.  Sometime, this time next year, he'll get it.  I guarantee it.  This time next year.  He's a cheater.  I want to continue with the knuckleball thing.  I love it.  Wakefield's pitching tomorrow, and then he'll hit it by the seventh inning.  They'll have reached his goal.  The best is, like, you know, they don't even have time to warm up the relief pitcher to  come in.  It's like, Barry Bonds is up for the third time in the first inning. 
[00:42:00]  You know, the rest of the pitchers are still, you know, making their way to the park,  figuring they're not needed until later on in the game.  They're going to bring in a long-relief lefty, but right now he's on the Gowanus.  Right.  He's on the team bus.  Stupid wakefield.  I've never liked knuckleballers.  I like a guy that can take the ball like a Clemens.  I like a guy who throws the ball just at really paralyzed you speed. 
[00:42:30]  Ridiculous speed.  And those guys are easy to hit.  A fastball is easy for a major leaguer to hit.  They can hit a fastball.  A hundred-mile-an-hour fastball, they can hit.  Yeah.  A knuckleballer, just a sloppy, fruity knuckleball doing 52.1 miles an hour.  Right.  Right.  That's hysterical when they do put the radar stats up on his pitches, and it does hit like 53 miles an hour.  They actually have a guy running alongside the ball with a counter.  They have to throw in a new ball every time because it hits the dirt somewhere. 
[00:43:00]  It messes it up.  And because this dummy left his lead press-on nails on the ball.  Right.  Stupid.  There's a little pink polish on the ball.  I hate those guys.  Oh, he's touching the bottom of his head.  He's flipping his nose.  He's picking his ear.  What's he putting on the ball?  He's putting a little Vaseline on it.  Vaseline.  Look at the brim of his hat.  Just want to talk to my golf fans out there.  Anyone see the U.S. Open?  I know.  I'm not even looking at you guys.  I know you didn't.  I did see it, actually.  Did you watch a little of it?  I did not.  It was...  All right. 
[00:43:30]  I just saw the clip of Tiger missing his long putt.  Nah, there was way more to it.  This course was ridiculous.  It was like a putt-putt course.  Really?  Yeah, they were putting from the fairway.  It was just so stupid to watch.  There was way too much luck involved in the U.S. Open this year.  Oh, I want to go to one buff girl.  Yeah, we're going to go to her.  But one buff girl, she was bummed out.  She went to Jones Beach and she wanted to see more wowing in the parking lot.  Well. 
[00:44:00]  We saw a lot of wowing.  Yeah.  A lot of girls showing what they have to offer.  Some giant ones.  I know someone took some pictures of me with some girl.  She was huge.  They were as big as your head.  They were giant.  They were bigger than your head.  Bigger than my head.  Bigger than your head.  All right.  Well, one buff girl called back.  We'll talk to you.  But the reviews are just coming in like crazy for the Jones Beach show.  Everyone very, very happy.  People love it.  Marge from the Little Shelter out there on Long Island.  What's up, Marge?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Welcome back.  Good morning, Marge. 
[00:44:30]  Thank you.  Marge is back.  She's over at the Little Shelter, which is in Elwood on what?  Huntington.  Huntington.  You know it's in Elwood, but that's part of Huntington.  It doesn't matter.  I know.  It's right there on, what's the road it's on?  It doesn't matter.  Warner Road.  Warner Road.  Just so people can look it up and contribute.  I'm sure in Vegas they're sitting there like, oh, Warner Road.  Okay, next time I'm out there on Long Island, I'll look up the Little Shelter just so they 
[00:45:00]  can contribute.  Did you like what we, Marge, did you like, Marge, shut up.  Did you like what we did to help the animals at the Jones Beach show?  Yeah.  We had the, let me finish, we had the little puppies who needed a home and we took a drawing  and then the person who won the puppies got to come up on stage and break their feet.  We broke little puppy feet.  Actually, you know.  Nutcrackers.  We also wanted to see where the animal lovers were, so we took the puppies and because 
[00:45:30]  Jones Beach is right on the water there, we threw them in the water and saw who would  run to save them.  Yep.  And it was good to see a few people jump over the fence into the water to save the little  fellas.  A couple.  God is listening.  Is he?  Yes, he is.  Right.  Now, the reason our address is very important is because I'm going to ask all of your listeners  to send in a few Viagra pills.  Are your legs weak?  Wait a minute. 
[00:46:00]  Hold on a second.  What?  It's been a while, Marge, or what?  Marge, is this a personal plea?  Yeah.  Why?  Well, it's not a personal plea.  I don't need Viagra.  But there's a dog at the shelter who is four years old.  Her name is Ingrid.  What's he having trouble making those German videos?  And she needs Viagra in order to live.  Why would a female dog, a bitch, if you will, need Viagra?  It's a very interesting story.  I want to tell you something.  There are a lot of doctors and vets that don't know about the other reasons to use Viagra 
[00:46:30]  other than the obvious ED problems.  This dog, because of the fact that she had a terrible heart problem due to heartworms,  was given Viagra by a vet, and it turned her around.  And she's just a different dog.  Turned her around, all right.  Right.  Let me tell you something.  If I have a Viagra, I'm not wasting it on a dog.  I'll give it to her by proxy. 
[00:47:00]  Of course the dog turned around.  She wants to see what's coming at this point.  Marge, can you hold on?  You're putting on Herman Munster boots and trampling every joke.  Yeah.  And you go slow.  There were two or three doozies in there.  A Lulu.  Now, it's heartworm.  And then what does the Viagra do, Marge?  The Viagra opens up her, what do you call it, her blood vessels.  Oh, the blood vessels.  You got me so flummoxed here.  Flummoxed. 
[00:47:30]  Flummoxed.  Flummoxed.  Stephen S. from Bayshore wants us to ask Marge to get back on the coroner's table.  He's trying to finish the job.  Wait, she's flummoxed.  I'm sorry, but, you know, this is really a very serious problem.  That's what Big A is.  He's a fat lummox.  Honestly, guys, if you would have seen this dog three months ago.  Boring.  All right.  But it was.  No, no, no, no.  She was so close to death.  This is important. 
[00:48:00]  Boring.  Yeah.  Let me tell you what.  Close to death.  Yeah, go ahead.  Continue your story, will you?  The doctor put her on Viagra, and it absolutely.  Boring.  We need the pill.  It's $10 a piece, and the little shelter is poor.  You can't afford $10 for that.  How many Viagra does this thing have to take?  One pill.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Wait, what the.  One pill every what?  One pill costs $10.  Yeah, but what does the Viagra do? 
[00:48:30]  Did we get to the bottom of this?  Yeah, it opens up the blood vessel.  Oh, okay.  It opens up the blood vessel.  Now, how many Viagra pills per day?  One pill a day, and what it's going to do is allow us to find her a good home, because  Little Shelter is going to provide Viagra for the rest of her life.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  So, how many milligrams?  Because there's 25, 50, and 100.  Believe me, I was in Brazil, Marge.  I was taking 100 a night and running through three broads for about 200 Americans. 
[00:49:00]  What do you think of them apples?  I don't know about that.  You turned some broads around.  Exactly.  Jimmy had heartworm, but now he's fine.  But when I was finished with them, they looked like there were heartworms in their hair.  We are giving her half of a milligram twice a day.  Half a milligram?  Half of a 100 milligram tablet twice a day.  That'll be 50 milligrams.  All 50 milligrams.  Marge, why don't you just let the bitch die?  Because she is, that is so sad. 
[00:49:30]  She is such a wonderful little girl.  Boring.  You may call it boring, but I wish you could have seen her the other day.  WCBS TV was there.  Oh, it was?  And everything they asked her to do, she did.  Boring.  How about die?  All right, but can I tell you the result of all of this publicity?  Marge, Marge, wait, you know, Chris makes a very good point.  I can't go to his phone call right now, but Chris writes, you can't mail prescription drugs. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, you can't just give to a doggy shelter.  Listen, we are getting...  Just fire up the oven, will ya?  We are getting pills from as far away as California.  People are mailing it to us, and so far...  I love how...  Jesus.  She's admitting illegal activity.  Admitting to a felony.  Guys, look, there's a cat that really needs pure cocaine.  So if you could, like, maybe get a kilo of coke and send it to the little shelter, 
[00:50:30]  this little cat needs cocaine.  And also, we have a turtle that needs heroin for its little legs.  It's the only way it'll work.  I don't really think...  How great is it that Marge is going to be on the news soon,  and she's going to be busted for having thousands of Viagra pills.  Her and Sammy the Bull are swapping ecstasy in Arizona.  Ecstasy, yeah.  Now, in the event...  In the event you get arrested, what do you need?  You want us to get you out of jail? 
[00:51:00]  You want us to raise the bell?  What do you want us to do?  You're going to get arrested.  You can't mail drugs.  Drugs!  Nobody has told us this, Opie or Anthony.  We're telling you!  Ingrid's a pit bull?  I'm telling you that if 200 men...  By the way, if the authorities are listening and they're going to bust Little Marge for having all these illegal drugs in the joint,  please mention in the story that she admitted this on the Opie and Anthony show.  So what you're saying is for the cost of a boner, you could save a little dog. 
[00:51:30]  And what a sweet little dog.  You know she's a pit bull mix.  And everybody has given that breed...  Oh, that's real smart.  Give a pit bull, Viagra.  Viagra, that's great.  What the hell is wrong with you?  Exactly.  You know what's going to happen to your poodles?  I know your wife will come home and find you.  The dog will have its little paws on your head, pulling you hostage.  Honey!  Yes, Marge.  Marge, yes, yes.  And I have to say a thing.  Okay.  If you don't want to send Viagra, send a contribution. 
[00:52:00]  Boring.  No, it's not.  I always contribute when I get the little mailer, that annoying little shelter mailer.  You have me.  Maybe if you save the money by not sending out stupid address labels.  You know, you have me at a disadvantage because everybody is listening to what you have to say,  but they have not had a chance to see this little dog.  This dog looks vicious.  Look at him.  That dog looks like it should be put to sleep.  Ingrid doesn't look like a bitch, I'll tell you that much.  No.  Do you want to know something? 
[00:52:30]  I wouldn't give Viagra to Ingrid.  She's going to get a little unruly.  Frisky.  Hey, Marge, I don't have a Viagra, but I can offer you, to help this dog, a caddy tire.  The tire of an 06 caddy.  Yes, Marge, yes.  Yes, Marge, yes.  Oh, really?  Trample, trample, trample.  Trample, trample, trample.  Trample, trample, trample, step on, step on, trample.  This was a thing that bothered me from the beginning. 
[00:53:00]  I felt by asking men to send in Viagra.  And by the way, you know, women use Viagra, too.  Stop digressing.  Do they?  And I thought...  Hey, Marge, when was the last time you used a little Viagra, if you know what I mean?  Don't need it.  I do not need it.  Do not need it.  I am very proud to say I can do it on my own.  All right, Marge.  Who are you having sex with these days?  That I can't tell you.  No.  Please.  Are the animals safe?  That's all I'm getting at.  Who's England's brother?  Mostly... 
[00:53:30]  I will admit one thing.  Mostly it's fantasy sex.  But...  Oh, okay, so she's by herself, kind of just taking care of business.  That's all right.  There's nothing wrong with that, Marge.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  How many jars of peanut butter do you go through a month?  Right.  Can I...  Yeah, Marge is a sicko.  She wants the Viagra to grind up into the peanut butter.  She's feeling good, and all the dogs are making that face and kind of...  licking the roof of their mouth.  Down at UPS, they call her the Skippy Kid. 
[00:54:00]  One other thing.  I was afraid that this message to men and women is not going to work, because, after  all, it's a very personal thing.  Of course.  And nobody wants to admit that they take Viagra except maybe Bob Dole.  So...  Wow.  Way to go with a current reference.  Hello.  Hello.  He takes it for his arm.  I was amazed that people...  Give him a Hitler salute until Bob Dole's still alive.  Yeah, I know.  In the middle of the night, he just wakes up, his arms in midair. 
[00:54:30]  Are we really doing Bob Dole jokes today?  We certainly are.  I gotta tell you.  Hey, how about that Bob Dole, Marge?  Wow.  Marge, Marge, just give us a little kudos.  The exposure you've gotten on the Opie and Anthony show, has it helped the Little Shelter?  Oh, absolutely.  People come in, and they say, is Marge here?  Oh, look at that.  How many dogs have you killed, thanks to the Opie and Anthony show?  Thanks to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's unbelievable. 
[00:55:00]  Little Shelter's pretty much a slaughterhouse.  Listen, I need you guys to help me find homes for animals.  Yeah.  I really do.  So...  Hey, Marge, how many dogs and cats have you pitchforked onto the back of a pickup truck  in the last month?  Where...  It would make your heart feel good if the two of you would hop into your truck and come  over to Little Shelter.  I just passed by Little Shelter the other day on my way to the bar.  Well, then, why don't you come over and... 
[00:55:30]  Why would I?  You know what?  Maybe we could have a little breakfast.  The place looks like a fire hazard, Marge.  She doesn't even have to put the dogs down.  She just talks, and they kill themselves.  They hand out little doggy ropes.  Figure out a way to make a noose with no thumbs.  Why don't you come over?  All right, hold on.  We're getting people calling.  They're into this Viagra.  Will you shut up for a second?  Marge, I'm not hanging up.  No, we won't hang up on you.  I'm putting you on with cigars and Scott.  Will you shut up?  Cigars and Scott, you're on with Marge from the Little Shelter. 
[00:56:00]  Go ahead, Marge, go.  Hello.  Marge?  Yeah, Marge, pitch.  Can we send oven mitts with the Viagra?  Oven mitts?  Oh, is that so you can open it up and put the doggy in?  I get you.  Marge, what do you do with the dogs you have to euthanize?  Yeah.  What's done with them?  Do they go to research?  We do not euthanize any animal.  Oh, you don't?  No.  We have animals that have...  They boil them alive.  ...that have major medical problems.  Hey, listen, didn't we save the lives of those two little cleft-palate puppies? 
[00:56:30]  Oh, did you?  I don't know.  We didn't get an update on that.  What happened to the cleft-palate puppies?  Yeah, because when you're done with us, you don't even give us the updates.  Yeah, what happened, Marge?  Now we're trying to get Viagra for your underground operation.  I'm not going to go there.  Do you have any dogs that don't suck?  Yeah.  Do you have any healthy dogs that are just fun to be with?  A bunch of wormy creeps with cleft-palates.  How about a nice dog that barks and fetches?  She's killing all the dogs that are going to tell the authorities on Marge and what she's 
[00:57:00]  doing in the back room.  Sell all your animals to Ringling Brothers.  How about a dog that just rolls over and gets a paper once in a while instead of a bunch  of genetic nothings?  We want dogs for our side show, for the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Show.  We want all the cleft-palate dogs, the dogs that need the Viagra.  Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages, come to the little shelter and see the amazing  one-legged dog.  Ladies and gentlemen, a dog that takes Viagra, the cleft-palate puppies, all the freaks of 
[00:57:30]  nature at the little shelter.  Get a good dog.  Get some cats.  So you can just pet on the head or under the chin and go, shook, shook, shook.  And they look at you and go, whr, whr, whr, whr.  You got freak animals over there.  You have the most adorable, adoptable puppies, kittens, dogs, and cats.  Steven S. from Bayshore is on fire today.  I'll just try to talk over it because she'll keep babbling.  Babble, babble, babble. 
[00:58:00]  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, see, she continues.  Steven S. from Bayshore, the little shelter can't put as many pets to sleep in a year as people  she's put to sleep on the radio this morning.  How are the other dumb dogs that are all stuck together?  She had like five of them with one head.  All right.  Hold on.  Yes.  No questions.  We run our show.  No questions right now.  Wait a minute.  We got Jim on with March from the little shelter.  Jim, yes.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Hey.  Welcome to talk to you guys.  Jim.  March.  Hey, Jim. 
[00:58:30]  Hi, Jim.  I tried to drop a dog off to you guys a couple weeks ago, and I called up, and you guys,  we donated a lot of money to the little shelter, and basically I was told that you do euthanize  the dogs.  That's why I didn't drop the dog off to you people.  Oh, March, comment.  That's a lie.  Jim, you're a goddamn liar.  March.  I wish I was.  I wish I was lying, because now I'm stuck with this dog.  You know, first of all, I don't know the situation, but if you want to call a little  shelter today, ask for March.  I'll be very happy to speak to you offline, but this is not something that is a truism. 
[00:59:00]  Don't spread rumors.  We do not.  You know, to say.  March, just say it.  You were just following orders.  Joke about it, but we have committed ourselves for over 80 years to find wonderful homes for  pay.  80 years?  How old are you?  She was 30 when she started.  Jesus.  She put Petey to sleep from our gang.  Why anybody would say anything.  Oh, sorry.  I was laughing.  I didn't mean to show enjoy. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, almighty.  God forbid we try to get a laugh out.  Yeah.  Oh, Marge.  You're just doom and gloom with your damaged dogs.  I'll tell you, though, Marge.  No one cares about you and your damaged dogs.  You're a saint.  I have to tell you, gentlemen, I sleep very well at night.  So do we.  You should sleep well.  You should sleep in a little box with dirt.  I'm not going to do that.  Hey, she kind of giggled a little bit at that one, Jimmy.  I heard her.  You know, Marge, every animal you have in there belongs in the book of Revelation.  That's true. 
[01:00:00]  I'm sick and tired of your stupid nine-headed serpents.  Wait a minute.  Shut your face.  At your age, I wouldn't be sleeping so well.  All right.  It could be your last.  Get me an animal.  It's not Satan.  I'd be having nightmares about the animal she has to look at every day.  You know, if what you say is true, then why don't you come over to Little Shelter and  see what we have?  I will.  Why?  You're feeding all the dogs Viagra and you want us to show up for a little fun?  No, thank you.  We tie our shoes.  You sicko.  We're not going to be part of your sick game.  As Marge says, bring out the gimp. 
[01:00:30]  The gimp's sleeping.  We have a ball gag in our mouth.  Listen, I have something that I want to say.  Okay.  Go ahead, Marge.  The mic is yours.  All right.  This is our mission statement.  If you guys are sincere.  Yeah, we are.  We want all dogs to die.  If you just like animals a little bit, that's all I ask.  I'm allergic to the wolf.  Why don't you come over to Little Shelter and do a live remote from the shelter?  Imagine the excitement in radio. 
[01:01:00]  The fun we could have broadcasting live from the Little Shelter.  A bunch of barking dogs.  Yeah.  Lab chimps running around.  That'd be cool.  Marge, I'm willing to listen.  I'm going to make a deal with you.  If we broadcast live from the Little Shelter, could one of our lucky listeners win a chance  to turn on the ovens?  No.  Imagine that.  No.  Nobody has ovens.  Nobody's putting animals to sleep. 
[01:01:30]  We have a countdown where every half hour, we get to gas another one.  If you do a live remote from Little Shelter, there'll be people.  There'll be people.  There'll be people.  One buff girl.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Sorry I have to wake up after that one.  Yeah.  What do you got?  I thought the show was awesome on Saturday, but I was looking for other chicks wowing.  I seem to be the only chick that was wowing.  I saw a lot of man junk, but... 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  The guys were like...  I don't know what the guys were up to, man.  E-Rock's got a picture up on our screens right now.  This is the guy that ran around to get backstage passes.  Look at him.  I'm looking at a guy with bologna boobs, and I guess he's got something going on down  there.  He has a bunch.  How can you tell?  It looks like he's doing...  But he's completely naked.  It looks like he's doing the...  The tuck.  The tuck.  It looks like Stephen King naked. 
[01:02:30]  Is this picture up on the website?  He doesn't even have bologna boobs.  They're kind of firm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's...  Yeah.  You need a bra for those.  He has breasts like Coco and Fame.  Like Irene Cara.  Oh, God.  He's the white guy with Irene Cara breasts.  What a creep.  Lovely.  That's great.  Yeah.  One buff girl.  We were very psyched with the females representing at the show.  I personally saw a lot of wowing going on. 
[01:03:00]  I mean, we're looking at a lot of pictures of girls flashing.  So...  I think I wowed you three or four times myself.  And that guy just had...  He had an innie.  That's what he had.  Yeah.  Penis.  Yeah.  I don't know what...  Well...  We understand what an innie was.  Yeah.  They probably jumped out because you added to it.  But yeah.  He has an innie.  Very good.  Like Vos would say...  Thank you, one buff.  He was in a cold shower and then he got a hammer.  And there was a knife and a...  I stink. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  We'll break and continue.  I want to talk about Mike Nifong when we get back.  This creep.  Which one was he?  He's the prosecutor from the lacrosse team that was completely innocent.  And they knew it right from the start, but he wouldn't let up.  Wouldn't let up.  Consequences.  Consequences.  All right.  Virus photos are up on our MySpace account.  Opie and Anthony, one word on MySpace.  And you can see some of the pictures of the things you missed.  Nice.  The next stop on the tour is Mohegan Sun. 
[01:04:00]  Let's not forget.  On June 30th.  Tickets still available through Ticketmaster.com.  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Thanks for checking us out this morning.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Paul McCartney's 65 today.  Oh, I finally saw that picture of him from his new album that you were talking about, Jimmy.  I saw it on a poster outside. 
[01:04:30]  He's making the dumbest face.  You're right.  He's got his lips almost pursed a little bit and some kind of puckered thing.  And he's holding his lapels.  And he's kind of, yeah, cocking himself sideways a bit.  Like he's peeking into a room going, ooh.  Who?  Who's here?  Ooh.  You know, just an older gentleman who popped in.  Ooh.  It's an atrocious picture.  Yeah, really bad.  He looks like an old lady.  Poor guy.  Something to be said about Donnie Young. 
[01:05:00]  I mean.  Oh, they were shit.  You know.  I don't think John Lennon would be having, you know, cute little photos taken of him.  How do you remember John Lennon?  The long hair, the glasses, you know.  The New York shirt.  And just kind of, you know, doing what he wants to do.  That stupid Yoko.  But that's kind of how you remember him.  And then Paul McCartney is just, oof, like an old woman.  There is something to be said for that, man.  He's looking more and more female every year now. 
[01:05:30]  And I watched some of the old newsreel stuff.  I forgot what it was even on, but it popped on the other day.  And I saw some of the old Beatles arriving in New York.  And then doing the Ed Sullivan show and all that.  And you're just looking going, oh, God, is that the same guy?  Jeez.  The little mop top.  Fast forward a few decades and no one cares.  No one cares.  No one cares for the most part.  Hardcore Beatles fans, they care.  Like the party.  They care, but.  That's about it.  And you know what's weird? 
[01:06:00]  He could be putting out great music still.  No one really knows.  No.  And I know some Beatles fans will call and go, ooh.  But seriously, name three Paul McCartney songs from the last 10 years.  Can you do it?  Three from the past 10 years?  No.  I can't name one in the last 20.  I can't name one.  Well, yeah.  He's never stopped recording.  So give me three songs he did in the last 10 years.  Three lousy songs.  Do we have any of his new CD at all?  Like any song? 
[01:06:30]  I would love to hear it.  Wow.  You know something?  You're right.  I could not.  I think the last song I know that he did was like, say, say, say.  There you go.  I mean, there was a time when Paul McCartney put out a song.  We all knew it.  It was on the radio.  You know, he was filling up great hits, CDs like crazy.  But name, I don't think I can name one from the last 10 years.  Not one.  And he never stopped recording.  He had a lot of the commercial hits, though, after the Beatles broke up.  You know, John Lennon seemed to have – he did what he wanted to do with his music. 
[01:07:00]  He didn't really seem to care if it was a big commercial hit or not.  But Paul would put out the, like, crap.  Pretty much a lot of crap he would put out.  Poppy crap.  But very popular, you know.  His Wings catalog is pretty strong.  Yeah, Wings was huge.  You're talking after that?  Yeah, after that.  When he's teaming up with Michael Jackson.  All that stuff.  Ebony and Ivory and doing – you know, that stuff is just drivel.  Remember Say, Say, Say? 
[01:07:30]  Which one were they selling the elixir?  Say, say, say.  The elixir.  What you want, but don't blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, Jimmy brings up a good point, though, when they were selling the elixir off the back  of the truck.  The video.  Going from town to town selling elixirs.  And Paul drank it, and Michael stole the Beatles catalog.  What an ass McCartney is.  And he knocks up a one-legged ex-hooker.  What?  There's no prenup.  I don't remember seeing that on the video.  I do remember when they stopped the wagon at the orphanage so Michael could pick up some 
[01:08:00]  things.  Oh, Paul McCartney seems to let people just walk all over him.  Yeah.  Or hop.  Or hop.  Has a little conversation with Michael Jackson, and Michael Jackson turns around and buys  the Beatles catalog from right underneath his nose, basically.  Do it, me friend.  Really?  Okay.  I'll screw you over.  Say, say, say.  That's an awful song.  Yeah, the elixir.  They're all...  They're going from...  The little funny motions they're making.  Oh, of course. 
[01:08:30]  It was a terrible video and a worse song.  They were snake oil salesmen going from town to town.  We like to call them elixir salesmen.  The little elixir.  This elixir.  Steve in Queens, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, McCartney's last recording project, or whatever you want to call it, was actually  an opera, which played at Carnegie Hall last year.  It had some Italian name that I can't remember.  That doesn't count.  We're talking about a song that's played on the radio that people know. 
[01:09:00]  We're kind of in the business.  I mean, we don't play music for the most part anymore, but I couldn't name one Paul McCartney  song in the last 10 years.  Apparently, the new CD, Memory Almost Full.  Yeah.  Is that what it's called, the CD?  Yeah, it's all over Starbucks.  Oh, wow.  It's like a high-tech kind of name.  Even though he's 65, Memory Almost Full.  I don't know.  You should see the montage of photos they have with it.  But one of them, he's actually leaping. 
[01:09:30]  Don't leap.  I would love to sit him down and go, what are you thinking, stupid?  Maybe he's just trying to get back at his ex-wife.  Look what I could do, and you can't.  The front cover is a chair.  It's a picture of an old chair.  See, Jimmy goes to Starbucks.  I do.  It's right there as you're paying for your $8 cup of coffee.  Yeah, it's a chair.  That's it.  It's a chair.  And the photo of him grabbing his lapels, like going like, huh?  Like that's probably the face he had when she took off her pants, and one of the legs  came off with it. 
[01:10:00]  He's probably like, oh!  Certainly not Sergeant Pepper.  Look at that.  It's a chair.  It's a chair.  Can we hear some of this?  Do we have like a little taste of Memory Almost Full?  All right.  It's good.  Billy Squire.  Oh, okay.  Is he playing a ukulele?  He is actually.  Is he?  He's playing a ukulele?  I was kidding.  Yeah.  Everybody's gonna dance tonight. 
[01:10:30]  Everybody's gonna feel all right.  Everybody's gonna dance around tonight.  Everybody's gonna dance around.  Everybody's gonna hit the ground.  Everybody's gonna dance around tonight.  What happened to yesterday?  This is as simple as they come.  The beat is okay.  Let's see if you want to.  You can do anything you want to do. 
[01:11:00]  This sucks.  Everybody's gonna dance tonight.  Foray.  Everybody's gonna feel all right.  Foray.  Everybody's gonna dance around tonight.  It's all right, but the lyrics are right.  No, it's awful.  It's, it's, it's, oh, my God.  It's no whistling.  Ukuleles and whistling.  Oh, thank you.  Travis is handing out the picture.  The lyrics are very trite.  Please, if you want to.  What is he doing?  What's he behind the, why is he behind the chair? 
[01:11:30]  I, I, you can turn this crap off.  I almost used the S word.  Uh, what, is there, like, a song that's a little more reminiscent of the old style McCartney?  Because that's just, I don't know what that is.  That sounds like some backwoods, uh, crap.  A ukulele and whistling and monotonous melody.  The lyrics are, everybody's gonna dance.  Everybody's gonna dance.  Who cares?  Everybody's gonna feel all right.  How about you rhyme star with something, you idiot? 
[01:12:00]  Come on.  Everyone's gonna hide behind a chair.  How about you don't need any more money and you should just, like, uh.  My wife's in a skirt.  Everyone stare.  I gotta get shoe polish to dye my hair.  Two down and two to go.  Horrible.  You have to listen to Mr. Bellamy, It's a Trainwreck. 
[01:12:30]  There's a song called Mr. Bellamy?  Mr. Bellamy?  Where's that?  Is that off the new album?  You got it?  Well, where's it from?  Oh, it is off the new album.  All right, let's listen to Mr. Bellamy.  Mr. Bellamy by Paul McCartney.  Happy 65th birthday, Paul.  Sir Paul.  Sir.  Who are we kidding?  He walked into this room right now, he'd fall over.  Oh, please.  Was this written to Bill for the last comment standing?  I know.  I'm not coming down, no matter what you do. 
[01:13:00]  I like it up here without you.  All right, Mr. Bellamy.  We'll have you down soon.  I don't like it, but at least it sounds like Paul McCartney a little more. 
[01:13:30]  What's that one to Heather Mills' foot in the clouds?  Oh, it sucks.  Ah, whatever.  Well, I just want to wish him a happy 65th birthday.  Didn't he write one to George, too?  There's something jiggling under you, Hats.  Oh, my God.  All right, what else has happened? 
[01:14:00]  You guys wanted to talk about the prosecutor.  He stepped down, right, from the Duke lacrosse case.  He was disbarred.  But this is what was interesting to me, this bum, Mike Nifong, who was going after these  three guys, even after it looked like they hadn't done anything wrong.  And when you're accused of rape, man, it really, it wrecks your life, even if you're not guilty.  It's an awful thing to be accused of.  And it bothered me because every, there was nothing racial about the case.  Allegedly, three guys attacked a girl.  Yeah.  But every article mentioned three white youths attacked a black girl. 
[01:14:30]  And now that they've been found not guilty, or the charges have been dropped, I read two  different articles, and not once does the press harp on their rape anymore, on their race  anymore.  Yeah.  It's really interesting how, like, now that the crime is gone, the racial angle isn't  interesting anymore.  I counted, let me see, one, two, three, four in this article and one in the other article  mentions of them and the accuser, this pig who tried to wreck their lives. 
[01:15:00]  A whore.  She is a whore.  She's a whore.  That's what the technical name for it is.  No, it's allegations by exotic dancer Crystal Gale Magnum, and they say kidnapping charges  against three former Duke lacrosse players who were, uh, for rape, sexual assault, and  kidnapping charges.  They just don't mention that all of a sudden the white-black angle is not interesting anymore,  so it gets dropped.  So the media is also repugnant.  But it was so nice that he got, I hope he goes to jail and then gets shot.  Oh, that's a nice well-wish. 
[01:15:30]  Dude, you gotta wreck someone's life like that, man?  He tried to ruin their lives.  What was his motivation?  Just, uh, uh, publicity, re-election?  Yeah.  Is it?  Yeah.  And here's the only mention of race.  It was a quote by Mike, uh, Nihong.  Uh, he had quoted when this was all going down that he wouldn't allow Durham to become known  for a bunch of lacrosse players from Duke raping a black girl.  And he also called the team a bunch of hooligans.  Hooligans?  Hooligans.  Hooligans.  But nothing had been...  Language.  Nothing had been proven. 
[01:16:00]  And I just wanted to say how great it is that he was disbarred.  And I hope he...  I don't know if he can go to jail for that, but...  Yeah.  Probably not, but, uh, boy, that's worse than losing your shock jock job, I think, when  you're disbarred.  Think all the school and all the...  Everything you have to go through to become a successful lawyer.  And then they just one day go, bap!  Ah, you can't do that anymore.  Sorry!  You can't do that anymore.  Well, he didn't turn DNA...  They had DNA evidence that proved that through...  I guess it was...  I don't know if it was semen samples or if it was blood or whatever it was.  It was in her body and in her panties. 
[01:16:30]  And it didn't belong to any of those guys.  Yeah.  Obviously from other people.  And he did not turn that over to the defense.  So he just...  He deserves to go.  And I'm just happy that it happened.  What a mess she was, huh?  Goes to this party and she still has samples all over her from other experiences.  I know.  She probably did a lot of parties that night.  Who knows?  I'm not going to think about a dancer.  You don't want to be last on the party list, man, when you're hiring a whore.  Yeah.  And speaking of... 
[01:17:00]  Well, I was going to move on to the doctor.  That's our story with the fast car.  Oh, yeah.  Going 120 miles.  An hour, yeah.  Down the expressway, I guess.  Out there on the ground?  Yeah, yeah.  This guy seemed a little irresponsible.  You think?  You know, I've been known to, you know, take my car out on a run or two.  But, wow.  This guy apparently...  Yeah, but you've gone 120 miles an hour out there, haven't you?  Yeah, but never on the expressway. 
[01:17:30]  That's crazy.  That's just crazy.  Well, that's when you go over the line and it's crazy.  There's too many cars.  You've got to go on roads that there's no cars on.  Yeah, you go on roads where the deer are popping out at any given moment.  Well, if a deer pops out, there could be trouble.  You're nuts.  But this guy was in a Ferrari, the one that Magnum P.I. had on that show.  And apparently somebody had seen him under the hood a few minutes beforehand.  So he was having some kind of trouble with it, I guess. 
[01:18:00]  And then got it going and went to give it a little shakedown, I guess.  See if whatever it was was fixed.  Lost control.  Hit a pole.  Rolled over numerous times and was ejected from the vehicle.  So either a seatbelt failed or he wasn't wearing a seatbelt, which is just insane in any instance.  Is anyone still just not wearing their seatbelts anymore?  Kenny.  Kenny doesn't wear a seatbelt.  No, never.  What is wrong with that idiot?  I don't wear one. 
[01:18:30]  No, you do.  Not really.  You got to.  Why don't?  No, no.  You're kidding, right?  No.  Tell me you're kidding.  Well, I guess when you're on a highway.  Aaron's around town.  Most accidents happen.  Aaron's around town.  Why wouldn't you wear a seatbelt?  And I'm on a cell phone and I'm like using my BlackBerry to get.  Putting on makeup and get some work done, you know.  Fiddling with the radio dial.  Fiddling.  I saw a girl the other day putting makeup on and on the cell phone.  And she was putting on makeup and using that scissor handled eyelash curler thing. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  And making the face, doing it.  So both eyes are just about shut.  What is she doing?  The crap that women have to do to look good.  Just insane.  And they're all doing a little rear view mirror.  Thank God.  Thank God as guys, we don't have to do that.  Imagine we'd have to use that eyelash thing every morning.  We got to like shave.  That's it.  That's pretty much it.  Shave and put on deodorant. 
[01:19:30]  But they're putting on makeup, foundation, take the little brush, turn their head sideways  and go, poof, poof, poof, poof, poof, poof, poof, poof, poof, poof, with the brush.  Turn their head the other way, poof, poof, poof, poof, poof, poof, poof, poof, poof on their cheeks.  And then, put the brush in more makeup, whip, whip, whip, whip, underneath the cheekbones,  beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  And then eyeliner.  How they figure that one out.  I'm going to draw on that little ledge on my eyelid.  Huh.  I don't like getting like a hair, a stray hair out of my eye.  It like creeps me out if I have to get my fingers too close to my eye. 
[01:20:00]  They're shoving sharp objects everywhere.  Pencils, little pencil and writing on their eye.  Like, just imagine.  Pick up the pen and just...  No, get it away from your eye.  Like, how do you do that?  And you have to do it in the mirror backwards?  Backwards.  You got to do it backwards?  In the mirror.  Exactly.  It's crazy.  The lipstick, the eyeliner, the eyeshadow.  Why don't they just do this, be hotter naturally?  Figure out genetically how we can breed a hotter woman. 
[01:20:30]  Come on, men.  What are you working on, cancer?  Throw it out the window.  Breed hotter women.  Get those stem cells and let's work on some cheekbones.  Let's go to Alan in Brooklyn.  What's up, Alan?  You know, I'm an old Beatle fan.  Yeah.  I remember hearing them when they first appeared on Ed Sullivan.  Sure.  All I can say is like this.  You know, Paul McCartney was never as great as Lennon and McCartney were. 
[01:21:00]  They were magic.  And as a single, Wings was never the Beatles.  There's no question about it.  I thought Wings was very good, though.  Especially for the time, for the early 70s, they were really good.  I liked a lot of the Wings songs there.  Well, you were into metal back then.  Except for, who's that knocking at the door?  Somebody's ringing the bell.  No, I don't like that one.  Do me a favor and open the door and let him in.  You know something?  Live and Let Die was a great song.  Yes.  When that came out, that was a great song. 
[01:21:30]  Okay, but.  Yes.  The point is.  Maybe I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time.  How about that one?  Maybe I'm amazed.  I danced to that song on my wedding.  How about Uncle Albert?  Well, stop with the Uncle Albert.  Lord, we're so sorry.  Uncle Albert, we're so sorry, but we haven't done a thing all day.  That's the E-Rock song.  He shakes his head.  Yes, yes. 
[01:22:00]  If you have stood up at the bat right now at 65 years, would you expect him to hit 60 home  runs a year?  No.  Look, I don't think his new stuff stinks either.  I can see like, yeah, it's all right.  It's not.  I mean, to be fair, Alan, he's in a tough place.  I mean, he's never going to be as big as he was with the Beatles.  Band on the Run.  Band on the Run.  That song was horrible.  Didn't like Band on the Run?  I liked the Band on the Run.  Someone's not.  Lennon, I think, was the brilliant lyricist out of the two. 
[01:22:30]  You think?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Him and McCarty.  You see what McCarty does on his own?  I thought Lennon's stuff stunk.  Post-Beatles, Lennon stunk.  Imagine?  Well, every one of them had a couple of good ones.  The greatest song of all time.  Which one?  Imagine.  It's a great song.  That, you know something?  Don't like it.  How about Imagine?  Yeah, Imagine.  Shut up.  It ain't going to happen.  It's a good song, though.  That's why you imagine, you idiot.  I don't want to imagine.  Half the stuff he's imagining, I don't want happening.  Wait, we all shine on. 
[01:23:00]  Nobody told me there'll be days like these.  We all shine on.  No, nobody told me there'll be days like these are stupid.  He's fitting too many words into the day.  Nobody told me there'll be days like these.  Nobody told me there'll be days like these.  Nobody told me there'll be days like these.  All right.  I hated that song.  His last album that he put out, I hated all those songs, too.  Why?  They're just awful.  Beautiful, beautiful boy.  Mo.  Yeah, you're right.  I really didn't think it.  McCartney had most of the hits post-Beatles. 
[01:23:30]  No, absolutely.  All right, well, Alex...  It's like this.  Well, Alex...  A guy who, together with Lennon, changed the face of music in America, took boring 16 music  and made it into something incredible.  Turned out, album after album, where every single cut was worth listening to, that's like  the crap today where they're willing to send one MP3 because the rest of the album sucks.  Right.  So the bottom line is, I wouldn't diss the guy.  Yeah, but he's 65. 
[01:24:00]  He's still out there.  He's producing.  He's trying to be innovative.  We're just teasing him, dude.  McCartney, you have to recognize, is one of the all-time...  We know that.  This guy doesn't have to do anything anymore.  He's strumming a ukulele and he has a one-legged wife.  How do we not make fun of him?  You brought up something...  That second cut that you played wasn't even half bad.  Alan, you brought up something interesting.  We get our music differently, though.  That's why, you know, you just want the one song.  I want the hit.  There's no reason to put out albums anymore.  We're all on iTunes and stuff getting songs for our iPods and whatnot. 
[01:24:30]  99 cents.  Give me the hit.  Back in the day, it meant something to put out an album.  You don't need to do that anymore.  Dude, he's hiding behind a sofa.  He's like an old paranoid person.  He's afraid that there are goblins in the house.  And you know what?  They're looking at my opinion and just keep putting it out there, guys.  You're provocative and I love listening.  When you historically look at McCartney, Beatles album covers always stunk.  I mean, like Rubber Soul, Abbey Road, four dopes walking across the street. 
[01:25:00]  But they became legendary.  I know that.  That like became legendary.  And he had no shoes on.  Right.  Paul is dead.  The dead rumor.  Dang.  Sergeant Pepper.  Where's that bunch of guys in awful clothes?  That was kind of...  Awful clothes.  I owned that suit.  That was wonderful.  I walked around with it.  What I don't understand about bands today.  Why do they continue to try to put out albums?  If I was a really hot band, I would just put out songs every like...  Like let's say you have enough music for an album and let's say it's going to be a good 
[01:25:30]  album, five or six tracks going to make the radio.  Why not just put out one song?  Spread it out.  And then a month later, two months later, you put out another song.  Imagine Ozzy, like his latest album.  Instead of having an album, it's like, all right, Ozzy's going to put out ten songs this  year, one at a time.  I'm only guessing because as artists, the way they work is to get everybody together  in the studio.  It's probably just too much of a hassle.  No, you get the whole project done, but then you release it. 
[01:26:00]  If you release an Ozzy, let's just go with Ozzy because Jimmy loves Ozzy.  If you released an Ozzy song, one song a month for the whole year, you're going to get a lot  of fans buying every single song.  But if you put out an album, they're going to pick out maybe three or four songs off  iTunes to download to their iPod.  It would be an interesting marketing strategy.  They're probably afraid of leakage too.  Yeah.  If they have it all out there, by the time you get to the second, third song, they'd all 
[01:26:30]  be leaked out anyway.  Yes.  Everything leaks.  Michael Moore's documentary is on line.  Sick off.  I know we want to get him in.  I don't know if we'll be able to, but I saw some of it.  I've not seen all of it, but it's really good, man.  Yeah.  It's really good.  I like his movies, but I don't buy the whole premise of a lot of them.  There's a lot of propaganda going on in there.  I agree.  On both sides, you know, but his movies, he really kind of skews it his way.  I'm going to change gears for a second. 
[01:27:00]  Opie, this is Tom from Mastic Beach.  Opie, I spoke to you during the meet and greet at Jones Beach on Saturday about doing a  wow sticker stop at my hot dog truck, but I didn't have any cards on me when you asked  me for one.  I wanted to touch base with you.  Can you call my cell phone?  A wow sticker stop at your hot dog truck.  How about this?  People walk up to you and go, wow, your life sucks.  This gentleman spoke to me also.  Tom, now, you know, we had a thing and you say face and I say face, but now I have to 
[01:27:30]  tell you how it is.  I asked for a business card knowing full well you did not have a business card.  Hot dog vendors rarely have business cards.  And that was the only way I could like end the conversation.  Also, a wow sticker stop at his hot dog truck, which is located at exit 70 of the Long Island  Expressway.  Oh, you know all this?  Exit 71 is London, England.  It is probably the furthest exit you can get to on the Long Island Expressway. 
[01:28:00]  Wait, he can't even figure out the hot dog truck business?  It's very far.  What he's trying to do is this.  He doesn't care about wow stickers.  This dummy wants to drive business to his pig innards truck.  Yeah, but his hot dog truck is so far out on Long Island.  Yeah.  Just like it's the last stop on the Expressway.  Tom, you've got to bring the hot dog truck a little closer to the city. 
[01:28:30]  And guess what?  Your business will go up twofold, maybe threefold.  All right.  What a sticker stop.  Will you send the guy some wow stickers, E-Rock?  Because he said you're the one that blew him off.  E-Rock.  E-Rock's trying to get a hot dog trade going with the guy.  No, most of our stuff's being packed up over there, so we didn't have them available to  send to him yet.  Oh, is it?  All right.  Tom, we're going to send you a wow sticker soon.  Maybe you can staple a sticker to every hot dog you sell.  Or just serve the hot dog in a wow sticker as the bun. 
[01:29:00]  Ooh.  There you go.  Jared in Boston, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Good to hear you back at the other joint now that you've been off the hook.  Anyway, I'm wondering if you could play a little Brother Joe going into break with Lady  McCartney.  Can we play that over here?  Crank us!  Ah, Crank us.  I'm dying to get suspended again.  I love going home at 9 o'clock and sleeping.  Isn't that good?  Oh, it's lovely.  Hey, Tom, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Tom, your hot dog truck is too far out on Long Island. 
[01:29:30]  No, I get a lot of truckers out there.  I get a lot of Hampton's people.  What?  The band?  Hampton's people.  Oh, Hampton's.  I thought you said Hanson.  You get a lot of Hampton's people?  Yeah.  Are they stopping in their Ferraris buying your hot dogs?  Yeah, whatever works, you know?  And you want a sticker stop?  Yeah, I get a lot of truckers too. 
[01:30:00]  A lot of people from out of state.  Mm-hmm.  Hey, Tom, do you get a lot of truckers buying the hot dogs?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Interesting.  Maybe there is a way.  We could send somebody out there.  What's the second most popular item to buy from a hot dog truck?  Hot dog truck.  I'd have to say a hot dog.  The second most.  The second most?  That's got to be the first.  Yeah, that's the first.  So what's the second?  The second most, I would have to say, would be a knish. 
[01:30:30]  Really?  A knish.  Very interesting.  Because you sell the knishes too.  And then beverages.  There's all sorts, I'm sure.  Mm-hmm.  I like it.  Do you have a special?  Because I know a lot of these guys, three hot dogs and a Coke, you know, for a certain price.  Three hot dogs, a soda, and chips, $5.50.  $5.50.  $5.50.  Ah, now you're pretty full after that.  It's only $5.50.  I like that.  I used to like the weenie trucks.  What else can you tell us about the hot dog truck business, Tom?  Yeah, how'd you get into it? 
[01:31:00]  What's it like?  Does it make money?  You know, it's starting off a little slow, so, you know, I'm trying to generate a little business, so.  Oh, what'd you just start?  Yeah, about a month ago.  What did you do before this venture?  Am I looking at your four kids?  Yes, you are.  Oh, my God.  We'll start to buy a hot dog from Tom.  They're adorable.  Why'd you do this to me, E-Rock?  Tom, what'd you do before this?  I was going to give Tom a good beating, and then you got to show me four kids.  I want to know what Tom did before the hot dog truck. 
[01:31:30]  Actually, I worked for Dish Network.  You did?  Yes, I did.  That's a sponsor of ours.  We love Dish Network.  No matter what Tom is going to say about it.  Don't you dare say a thing, Tom.  Don't you dare.  I'll get your hot dog business rolling.  They fired me.  He's probably spilling hot dog water all over the wires.  Yeah, he's practicing and getting mustard on the dishes.  I hate E-Rock.  I was ready to go in for the kill, and he shows me these four adorable kids.  So did you decide?  Four adorable kids.  How did you decide from going from, like, Dish Network that you would then, instead of maybe go out, pound the pavement, get another job, that you wanted to be a hot dog salesman? 
[01:32:00]  Unfortunately, after working for Dish, there's really nowhere else to go.  They don't give you much of a work experience unless you want to do more dishes.  Well, dishes, you know.  You're doing hot.  Well, you went from dishes to hot dogs.  Wasn't there, like, up front money you had to kind of, you know. 
[01:32:30]  A little bit, a little bit.  Buy the business.  All right.  All right.  You know what?  I'm fascinated.  You know what, Tom?  Give out the big plug for your hot dog truck so these four kids don't starve.  I hate you, E-Rock.  Exit 70 on the entrance ramp on the LIE, and come by.  East or westbound ramp?  Yes, it is.  I think there's only one over there.  He said yes, it is.  I think there's only one.  Oh, okay. 
[01:33:00]  And if you go too far, you'll hit the ocean, so.  Yeah, look out.  Look out for the lighthouse right afterwards.  You've got to jam on the brakes, or you hit the Montauk lighthouse.  All right, my friend.  Sell lots of wieners.  Thanks, guys.  Good luck.  All right, Tom.  Yeah, Tom was going to get a sound thrashing until we saw his poor kids.  His four adorable kids, all eager and full of life.  You know that it's just like, what's for dinner tonight?  Hot dogs again, Dad. 
[01:33:30]  They have hot dog cereal for breakfast.  A bunch of cut up hot dogs and some milk.  Everything's a hot dog medley.  We have the knish dog medley that you kids love so much.  Probably makes his wife, you know, crush the hot dogs together to try to make it look like a hamburger.  Yeah.  Yeah, make a hamburger out of ground hot dog.  It's their birthday.  They have hot dog cake with the frozen hot dog, so it looks like ice cream cake. 
[01:34:00]  And they know what their present is because you can't wrap a hot dog.  It'll look like it's wrapped, but then the ends have the puffs of wrapping paper out the side and a ribbon on each thing and tying it closed.  It's a little moist gift that feels like it could be a cigar, but they have to act surprised.  A hot dog.  Gee, Dad.  Thanks.  All right.  Rum runner from Wackback, Springfield, New Jersey. 
[01:34:30]  Aw, Opie.  And then he writes, I sell consulting services.  Where can I send you a picture of my family?  We were going to give that guy a beating.  And then these four adorable kids all smiling and eager and just full of life.  Life hasn't knocked them down yet.  When they say bring your dad to work day and the other kids are bringing in lawyers and this dodo pulls up in a truck, shits like a weenie.  And the best thing you can do is give everybody a free hot dog. 
[01:35:00]  A free dog.  Crout and realish.  I bet you they have kraut for dessert.  Kraut.  They have hot dogs and some sauerkraut for dessert with some jimmies on it.  Some whipped cream and some jimmies on some kraut.  Some jimmies.  Call my kids in for dinner.  Nathan, Oscar, Meyer, come on in.  It's time for dinner.  You know the guy can't afford a car, so he's driving the hot dog truck to pick up his kids at school. 
[01:35:30]  His weenie vehicle.  Shaped like a big weenie.  Because he is one.  Well, that's terrible.  And his little girl, she's a brat.  I'll bet you that the parties stink and no one shows up.  Like it's the kid's birthday because they have a piñata and it's just leaking that icky water.  And everybody knows what's in the piñata.  But it's full of.  Like you hit the piñata and it's just like a dull thud. 
[01:36:00]  Like you're hitting a fat person in the stomach.  And you hit it and then just some chopped up hot dog pieces fall out of the rug and no one wants them.  Oh, and he's all eager.  Come on, kids.  Gather them up.  And the kids are looking at their parents crying.  Toothpicks for everyone.  And you're supposed to pick him up.  There's a way.  A butler walking around.  There's his stupid cousin who has a drug conviction walking around holding up a tray with little pieces of weenie on it.  Weenie, sir. 
[01:36:30]  Jerome in Queens.  Jerome.  What's up, man?  Hey, man.  Hey.  What's going on?  Yeah, I bet you that dude's daughter is going to end up being a lesbian when they're all in.  He's going to be so sick of wieners.  I shan't put another one of those in my mouth.  Oh, it's just awful.  Bombing for hot dogs around Halloween.  Just packets upon packets of condiments in all of their cabinets.  Well, that's what they use in the winter to keep the back tires from sliding around.  They put in boxes of frozen hot dogs and portable relish. 
[01:37:00]  They're little relish condiment things.  They don't have ketchup bottles.  They have to open up to tiny little packets.  Little condiment packs.  Little packets.  They have to bathe in hot dog water.  All four kids in some lukewarm hot dog water with those little pink pieces of hot dog meat floating around in it.  All the kids smell like weenies.  What a terrible little picture we painted. 
[01:37:30]  Awful.  When did Opie get a heart?  I got a heart.  You just got to figure out how to get to that.  I bet you everything around the house is like a hot dog analogy.  You know what I mean?  You know, it plumps when you cook it.  What can you say?  Oh, the lives are just hell.  It's a living hell.  Down there at Exit 70.  Exit 70.  When he had a new baby, we all know what he handed out. 
[01:38:00]  All those co-workers that have put a cold hot dog into their pocket.  Congratulations, Jones.  Yeah, she's got another long bun in the oven.  Stupid hot dogs.  The construction workers love them.  I bet you for special occasions, his wife has like a really delicious relish treat she whips up.  She whips up the relish treats for everyone. 
[01:38:30]  The relish dip.  It's a hit at the Super Bowl parties.  They think it's going to be like a Sunny Delight commercial where all children of all races will poke their head in for relish treats.  But there's no black kids, no Asian kids, just four white children in the same family looking for relish treats.  Looking for anything but a hot dog to eat.  Poor kids.  Every time they hold up a relish treat to make friends with a bully, a fist crack just throw it right into the little jaws.  Downtown Dave from Kansas City. 
[01:39:00]  He married his wife because she had nice buns.  That picture made me so sad.  Guy just wants to sell a few extra hot dogs to keep the kids happy.  Do they have a wiener dog?  Those little wiener dogs?  Yeah, it's all dachshunds.  A house of dachshunds.  Everything in the house is long and oblong.  The sofa has no back on it. 
[01:39:30]  Just a low sofa with yellow paint in the middle.  They're hoping the news will come over and do a story on the hot dog family.  Nobody cares.  All hot dogs.  Nobody cares.  They just think their asses in their house stinks.  Christmas tree with a bunch of hot dogs hanging on it.  The little hooks in them.  You got to hook them on the tree.  And a big bratwurst on top. 
[01:40:00]  Stupid hot dog.  Hot dogs everywhere.  Same joke four times a week.  Is that a hot dog?  Yes.  I'm not happy to see you.  It is.  Can't you tell by the stain on my pocket?  She probably gets hot dog trinkets for every holiday.  Just some kind of hot dog trinket.  Hot dog.  They play like hot dog trivia games.  Who created the first weenie roast in Northern America?  And all the dumb kids throw their little hands up. 
[01:40:30]  We know the answer, Dad.  Of course you do.  Poor children.  What does your father do?  My father's a police officer.  How about yours?  My father hawks cylindrical sow intestines.  At exit 70 of the LIE.  He can't even figure out that.  He hangs around the exit ramp like a prostitute.  Selling poison.  He's dressing sexy in his hot dog truck. 
[01:41:00]  Hoping to get a few extra sales from the old truckers.  Just a filthy white apron.  He wipes his hands on it constantly.  Five minutes earlier, he's under the hood changing oil.  Now he's serving you lunch.  You think he has one of those cute aprons with a cute little saying on it?  Yeah, he's something hot dog.  I'm the hot dog man.  It just doesn't end. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Chris from Long Island.  Hey, Chris, what's up, man?  You guys are missing the obvious holiday.  What?  Halloween.  Halloween.  They call it trick or treat.  Oh, get the hot dogs for the children.  Just dump them in a bag.  By the time the kid gets to the street, it's wet through and all the candy's falling out.  You get to hear that big thud of your hot dog in the bottom of your candy bag. 
[01:42:00]  And then their house gets pelted with their own hot dogs all night long.  Or the really good costumes.  The kids get like little relish packs.  They throw in some relish packs and a little thing of applesauce.  And you know that no one opens the door when the four children are trick or treating because  they know who it is because there's a miserable woman walking four little hot dogs with four  hot dogs.  They all have like yellow shirts on and stupid bun costumes. 
[01:42:30]  And their father has like hats with a father's truck company name on.  Braxton from Cleveland.  Kid comes home with a hamburger and his parents yell at him like they found drugs.  What are you eating?  None of the kids want to go over to his house for dinner for the kids house from school.  You want to come over?  No.  No.  No.  We don't.  What are you having tonight? 
[01:43:00]  Steak.  What's his MySpace account for the hot dog dude with the four cute kids?  Maybe we could just have a fundraiser, pay the guy's bills.  Yeah, let's get this guy.  Jesus.  Enough with the hot dogs.  You know, we used to get free satellite television.  Now, all the hot dogs we can eat, kids, right?  That's just the antenna.  I'm not really out here at exit 70.  We don't get such good reception from the city station.  Oh, it's MySpace account is all one word.  Of course, Mom and Pop's Hot Dog Grill. 
[01:43:30]  No, it isn't.  No, it isn't.  Everything this guy does now is hot dog related.  Mom and Pop's Hot Dog Grill.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mom and Pop's Hot Dog Grill.  MySpace.com slash.  Yeah.  Well, we know that part by now.  Well, some people are stupid.  They have a lot of high cholesterol by the time they're 11.  Stop.  Whatever hot dogs do to you, relish.  And impacted colons. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  I know.  They're all going to be on the ball like Elvis before their freshman high school.  Probably discovering other uses for the mustard.  That keeps their skin clean of acne.  Your mother tries to talk about the benefits of relish juice for the children.  Would you like a chilled relish juice?  I don't have to buy shampoo for the kids.  We learned that the relish juice does the job.  Yes.  Those little ketchup packets.  I tell you, it washes the hair.  It's a great conditioner. 
[01:44:30]  All right.  We're real late.  See?  That's the beauty of the show.  Boring call from Hot Dog Man.  Love Hot Dog Guy.  Turns into silliness for everybody.  And we have a special guest to promote.  We're going to allow Roland to do it.  I think when we come back, we should have Roland promote this special guest.  Jimmy, I got a pair of tickets for the premiere of Live Free or Die Hard.  When is that?  June 22nd at Radio City Music Hall.  Nice.  I think we're going?  I think we're going to the premiere?  Yes.  Bruce requested us, actually.  Bruce Willis is back. 
[01:45:00]  Did he?  Did he really?  No, no.  Not Bruce Willis.  No.  Probably another Bruce Willis.  Bruce Willis, the guy that works at the Ziegfeld.  This is the frustrating part about our radio show.  They want us to be all over this premiere.  You know, Live Free or Die Hard.  And it sounds like it's going to be a good movie and all that.  We're giving away tickets right now.  Blah, blah, blah.  We're like, well, if you want us to get all over this movie, how about you get us Bruce Willis?  He's very busy.  And then there's all these weird excuses that he lives in, like, Hong Kong.  And it's like, you know, it's like 1.52 in the morning. 
[01:45:30]  And he can't call at that time.  I know.  There's always some weird reason.  But they want us all over this movie for them.  And we have no problem with it.  Instead of Bruce Willis, they said they'll get us Willis Drummond.  Right.  It's so stupid what we go through on a daily basis with this show.  The only way to Live Free is to Die Hard in theaters June 27th.  We got a pair of tickets to the premiere.  Very cool.  A Radio City Music Hall.  K-Rock here in New York is doing a big thing with that. 
[01:46:00]  Give us a call.  877-212-5762.  Travis will pick a random caller and give you the tickets.  Okay?  Right.  We're really late.  We'll be back.  It's O&A and little Jimmy Norton.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Bad boy radio host.  Opie and Anthony.  Why is the left boob always larger than the right boob? 
[01:46:30]  Where?  Does that have something to do with the heart?  It's damn flight benefits.  It's sexy.  Wow.  I don't see that.  Yeah.  She's topless, putting lotion on herself.  She's lotioning herself up, and Jimmy was just doing a little dance over here.  Yeah.  And everyone's saying, what's Jimmy doing?  I show you how I hump.  Yeah.  I just grab those hips, and my hips, I go hump. 
[01:47:00]  I hump good.  She's oiling herself up, and E-Rock didn't have it up front on his monitor.  Why, Woody?  He's gay.  Jimmy's on fire today, man.  It's Opie and Anthony, by the way.  Oi.  We have to promote our guest tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  Go get Roland.  Yes.  Go get Roland.  Where is the inimitable Roland?  Fantastic Four is number one at the box office.  Of course it is.  Yes.  I don't understand why we keep track of what's number one at the box office. 
[01:47:30]  No one's going to be number one at the box office.  The movie you see the most commercials for during the week.  You think that's how it's working these days?  That's all it is.  Well, anything kids and adults will both like, which movies are fantastic for Spider-Man.  Comic book movies.  Yeah.  Huge.  Yeah.  They are the phenomenon.  Speaking of movies, we got Roland in the studio.  What's up, Roland?  It's going all right.  You got us a good one for tomorrow, man.  Yep.  What do you want to mention?  Oh, oh. 
[01:48:00]  Sir Ben Kingsley.  That's right.  Sir Ben?  Sir.  Sir.  Sir.  Serpent?  We have a serpent on tomorrow.  Wait, wait.  What?  Sir Ben Kingsley.  Ben Kingsley?  Wait, wait, wait.  Will you stop at the pause?  It's what?  Sir Ben Kingsley?  Sir Ben Kingsley?  Sir Ben.  Ben.  Sir Ben.  Osama Ben Laden?  No.  One more time.  Sir Ben Kingsley? 
[01:48:30]  Sir Ben Kingsley?  I'm not even going to...  I still don't know who's on the show tomorrow.  I know it's a sir.  Well, give us the movies he's been in.  Lucky Number Slevin.  What?  Wait, what?  Lucky Number Slevin.  What?  I did see that, and unfortunately, it is titled Lucky Number Slevin.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I know.  I really thought we had a good one.  You thought we had a doozy with him there, didn't we? 
[01:49:00]  I was getting so excited.  I picked my piping hot coffee up to sail at your jawline.  Piping hot.  Oh, Kevin.  Yeah, I would have liked to have seen that.  Oh, that sucks.  All right.  That movie was pretty good.  What other movies?  Bugsy, Sexy Beast, Sneakers.  Don't mention the Oscar one.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't mention...  How about the big one?  What else?  Ah.  What about...  Schindler's List?  You said it right. 
[01:49:30]  Schindler's List?  What?  Wow.  Wait a minute.  Well, it was a movie that wasn't very popular.  I mean, not many people heard of it, so maybe that's...  All right.  And it's...  What's it called?  I knew it.  Yeah.  Schindler's List.  Wow, is he tripping over his tongue on that one?  You're not...  You're panicking.  Just don't think.  Just say it.  Yeah.  Schindler's List.  Schindler's List.  Schindler's List.  Someone's wrist.  Oh, God.  His speech is a holocaust. 
[01:50:00]  It really is.  Schindler's List.  Go ahead.  Schindler's List?  Who's Schindler's List?  Schindler's.  You see any movies over the weekend, Ron?  It's a list of chandeliers.  Yeah.  Huh?  I saw the movie once.  It's called Once?  Yeah.  Oh.  It's really good.  I thought you were going to say, I saw a movie once.  I saw a movie once.  Because that's more like you.  And then you wouldn't continue after that.  Yeah.  No, but it was really good.  Schindler's List.  All right.  We look forward to who tomorrow on the show? 
[01:50:30]  Ben Kingsley.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben Kingsley.  Ben.  What about the Sir part?  Sir Ben Kingsley.  One more time with the movies?  Schindler's List.  Gandhi?  Yeah.  Gandhi.  That was a good one.  Boy, Roland has not left me alone about watching that movie.  His new movie.  You Kill Me.  I just got a...  What's the new movie?  You Kill Me.  You Kill Me.  It's getting good reviews.  I'm going to kill you if you ask me one more time if I've seen the goddamn movie.  What's it about?  Oh, it's wonderful. 
[01:51:00]  He plays a recovering alcoholic and he's a hitman.  Mm-hmm.  Can I have a copy of that?  I would love to see that.  It's at my house.  Yeah.  Once I watch it.  And I got a copy.  Why don't you get three copies?  I'll watch them.  You really need to get three of everything, Roland.  Do you understand that yet?  I tried.  I only had two.  All right.  They had more than two.  I would watch it.  I would have had it all ready for the interview with Sir Ben Kingsley.  Sir Ben Kingsley.  The star of Schindler.  You're sure we're in a large list.  I don't know.  All right.  Thanks. 
[01:51:30]  Moving on to other things.  He tripped over the chair on his way.  Just a disaster with arms that are so hairy it gives me the creeps.  His monkey arms.  He really does.  But they're wispy and combable all the way up the front.  No one has hair on their biceps.  They're supposed to be on the outside of your arms.  I saw more skin through Mikey the Chimp's hair on his arm than you can on Roland.  It really is awful.  It's a blow-dryer's forearms.  Simeon creep.  Hey, here's a feel-good story. 
[01:52:00]  Uh-huh.  Man, 73, fails high school exams after 39th try since 1969.  69.  39 tries.  Why is he bothering?  There's a reason.  Is this like one of these stories that people...  There's a reason.  Stories of people...  What's the reason?  He's a farmer.  He's an Indian guy from India.  From India.  Well, I mean, you know...  As opposed to American type.  Right.  He wanted to...  He vowed he's going to try next year in the hopes that an education will improve his job and marriage prospects. 
[01:52:30]  He's 73.  This dumbbell, this dope, he has failed 39 times.  39 times.  One more time, and they give him the keys to a hot dog truck.  I was going there.  But he has one more chance, is what you're saying.  One more shot. 
[01:53:00]  But he wants...  But the beautiful thing is that he wants to try again to improve his job prospects or marriage.  Yeah, at 70...  What?  73.  73.  It's pretty much over at that point.  What's the life expectancy in India?  190?  Let it go.  Yeah.  Just find another dope and marry her.  You're done.  He's got a dream.  Yeah, but somebody who wants to marry him, maybe probably has dementia.  Just tell you, graduated high school.  I love that one.  And a cute story tonight.  A grandmother, a great-grandmother, has gotten her GED. 
[01:53:30]  Great.  What the hell good is that going to do her?  None.  As a greeter in Walmart.  GED for an old person should be get an early death.  With that, we go to another feel-good story.  It's feel-good story Monday, right?  Isn't it?  These guys are keeping track of all these, aren't you?  Yeah.  What is today?  Oh, we haven't made anything for Monday. 
[01:54:00]  All right, there you go.  Feel-good story Monday.  Two-year-old Julian loves apple juice, so that's what his mother ordered for him at the Applebee's restaurant in Antioch on Monday.  However, Kim Mayorga says when Julian drank from the plastic child's cup, he started making faces.  Mayorga then took a sip and got a jolt.  I just knew it was alcohol.  It wasn't apple juice.  I knew that.  Not just any alcohol, but top-shelf margarita, according to what Mayorga says an Applebee's official told her.  So they gave a kid a margarita instead of apple juice. 
[01:54:30]  And then arrested him for underage drinking.  And driving.  That bad boy.  A little punk.  We have to break already?  Yeah, you hear the kid started vomiting.  Like, the mother wasn't going to make a big deal about it.  She was just like, oh, okay, it's a margarita, but you made a mistake.  And then the kid got sick and started vomiting.  Was it a mistake or did they do it on purpose?  They said it's a mistake because the apple juice container and the margarita container looked very similar behind the bar. 
[01:55:00]  So when they poured out the apple juice in the little sippy cup and gave it to the kid, they didn't know it was margarita.  So then the kid...  But you just don't pour a margarita out of a container.  You got to chill it up a little bit and get something going on there, don't you?  I don't know.  I don't know how they work it over there.  Apparently, they said it was a mistake and the mother wasn't going to do anything about it.  And then the kids started getting sick.  Right.  So, lightweight.  We got a break.  A little two-year-old can't handle a few sips of a margarita. 
[01:55:30]  Poor little fella.  We have to break, but we have...  This is a quickie.  We're going to sneak this in.  British TV reporter who is terrified of roller coasters is forced to ride one, I guess, just to make a cute little story for TV.  Oh, I love these.  But she's terrified of roller coasters.  So, if I can get it underway now as soon as I can, and I'll give you a few facts while I'm going up.  150...  Oh, 120 G, sorry.  It loops over five times.  It falls at 4.5 G, and there are eight times of much... 
[01:56:00]  Oh, it's the going up part.  That's the easy part.  Yeah, she's having...  Remember, she's terrified.  It's the part that usually goes...  ...on the old coasters.  So, she's giving some fun facts about the roller coaster.  The ride up is really nice.  It's kind of like, ooh, look at the view.  Ooh, we sure are getting high.  And then, once you get over that lip on the top...  It is frightening.  I'm not a big fan of the roller coaster.  I must say.  Do you see the people falling upside down?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They were hanging upside down for like a half hour? 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  And they were saying they could tell everybody that that happened to them.  Because for the whole rest of the day, as they walked around, their faces were just beet red.  Really, so much blood had rushed to their head for such a length of time.  They could get a stroke.  I was hoping someone had liquid duty.  Oh, God.  What a mess that would make, hanging upside down.  Well, you'd be cleaning up for a couple of days.  My grandmother took me on a Coney Island roller coaster when I was very young.  And I screamed and cried. 
[01:57:00]  And there was a black guy with his son in front of us.  And he was trying to comfort me.  Aw, that's nice.  Aw.  Well, my grandmother sat there.  She was 80 years old when she was 70.  Holding on for dear life while her fruity grandson screamed her girlish head off.  Well, let's go back to the British reporter.  So, she's having a good time.  Yeah.  Fun facts as the roller coaster goes on.  Keeping this all together, I've been reliably informed.  It's suspended over water.  And I've been told that it's one of the prettiest roller coasters. 
[01:57:30]  If only I could keep my eyes open long enough to look at the view.  Apparently, it's great.  Now, the tips I've been told are to keep your eyes open and just go with the flow.  Feel it.  Enjoy it.  Look at the sunny day.  Look at the beach.  And as you can say, I'm giving some positive thinking here.  Because I'm...  Oh, I really don't like this.  And look at the 50 yards beneath you.  Yeah, anyway, I'm not...  Yeah, thank you very much, Matt.  And that was not very nice of you, by the way.  I can actually still hear you, which is all good.  But this certainly is not very good. 
[01:58:00]  No!  Shut up, my eyes!  I don't like it.  No!  I don't like it.  Oh, I'm so glad I did now.  Breakfast!  This one!  This!  This!  This!  Oh!  Oh! 
[01:58:30]  Well, I think it's nearly over.  Oh!  Yes!  This one!  Oh!  Oh, definitely, definitely a horse carousel girl.  I'm really sorry.  I'm an absolute worst.  She's crying.  She's crying.  Oh, is that great?  Her screams have been bad.  We got the scream isolated.  You want to hear it again?  It sounds like the soundtrack from an interracial porn I read.  Ready?  Oh, my God! 
[01:59:00]  That's better.  I don't like it.  Stop whining.  Oh, God. 
[01:59:30]  All right.  Her screaming is really fantastic.  That's terrific.  Yeah.  I'm a little scared.  Quick break, and we'll wrap up this part of the show next, okay?  Right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Rock and roll.  That's funny.  Wow.  What happened?  I mistook the time for a moment, and since me and Jim were talking about the other program, 
[02:00:00]  I thought we were actually on that now, and I swear I was ready to just lay into some profanity.  You thought it was time to curse.  Yeah.  What were you going to say?  I don't know.  Something that starts with an F.  Well, this radio business is really weird.  Really weird.  30 days ago, we thought we were fired from one of our gigs.  Yeah.  We were suspended for 30 days.  We made a huge comeback, what, Friday?  Yep.  We're back working for the other people again. 
[02:00:30]  It's still not right to name them, say them by name.  And that's just...  I just thought of the other people.  That's just...  I don't know.  The other people that are helping me pay for my mortgage.  That won't be mentioned.  No, not yet.  And so we thought we were fired.  We were suspended for 30 days.  Now we're working for those other people again.  And a mere few days later, they're building us a brand new state-of-the-art studio.  Yeah. 
[02:01:00]  They're building us...  This is so effed up.  They're building a beautiful studio for us.  Like state-of-the-art.  But...  We're going to have like nine cameras in there that are going to make these little cameras  we got in here look...  Silly.  Look silly.  And it's going to be really big, and there's going to be glass walls.  We're going to be in a glass box.  We're going to have an area for people to perform.  And an audience and everything, because we like having the studio audience come up like  we did Friday.  We had a huge studio audience, and I think that definitely added to the show. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  Couches.  Yep.  It's supposed to be finished by fall of 2011.  Yeah.  They're probably building it for the next guys.  Well, that's just it.  I mean, we've seen how they work.  It takes a while for them to do things.  Wait, you've actually seen them work?  No.  Oh.  I've seen how they work, and by how, I mean don't.  They're on schedule for this, I think, pretty much.  You're close to under the night, are they?  I have no idea.  Walls come down today.  On schedule...  Jimmy, on schedule would have been done two years ago.  I guess the point I'm making, we get those freaks that hang out outside every day. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  We're not going to be outside for a little while.  Not going to see us.  For what, four to six weeks, something like that?  Can't be that long.  A month?  I don't know.  How long?  It can't be that long.  How long, E-Rock?  Microphone.  Two weeks.  About three to four weeks.  All right.  Now, how does this work?  Because our buddies, Ron and Fez, are taking vacation during this time.  The whole time?  Well, two weeks off, I guess.  Yes.  Right?  Next week.  What?  They're off two weeks next week.  Well, what are they going to do now?  But they can't be off two weeks next week, because next week's only one week. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, you're right.  Starting next week.  Oh.  So what are they going to do this week when they're ripping the studio apart?  They're in the little closet studio in the corner.  No, they're not.  Yep.  There is no way they can broadcast their program from that little closet.  That's hilarious.  I can't even.  Do you know why people say a room is small?  Picture a small walk-in closet.  Yeah.  No bigger than that.  And you usually say that's got to be an exaggeration, because if it's an actual radio studio, it can't  possibly be that small. 
[02:03:00]  It is.  We're not exaggerating.  I swear to you, it is the size of a walk-in closet with equipment in it.  Don't picture a walk-in closet that you walk into, and the middle has nothing in it.  It's got everything you need to broadcast.  A console, the microphones, other equipment.  It is.  There is no room in there.  How are they going to do the show?  You can only get one Ron and a half a Fez.  Right.  It's going to be the Ron and Fez show. 
[02:03:30]  It's going to be outside yelling, hey.  Those guys will make it fun.  Of course they will.  Yeah.  It'll be good.  Hey, let's get an update from Bear.  Wherever I went this weekend, especially at Jones Beach on Saturday, everyone asking about Bear.  Yep.  Our buddy Bear.  He won a horrid relationship.  He won the Father's Day giveaway.  Thank God, because he's just in hell at home.  His wife, been with her for years.  Last time they even had...  18 years, I think.  18 years.  Last time they had any kind of sexual relations, it was 12 years ago when he conceived his daughters. 
[02:04:00]  And the guy, his wife, doesn't care.  Doesn't care.  Doesn't want to give him sex.  Doesn't want to have sex.  It's not even part of her life.  Like, even have a romantic evening.  Nothing.  She cares about the cats more.  The 15 cats that they have.  The big cats.  Doing what she needs to do for the kids and keeping the big house clean, I guess.  And he comes in, like, last in everything. 
[02:04:30]  He's not a priority in her life.  And the sex thing, forget it.  Just hasn't happened.  So we figured this poor sap, we hook him up for Father's Day and get him a date with one of the lovely ladies at the Bunny Ranch out there in Nevada.  So he won the big giveaway.  Let's get an update from Bear, see how he's doing.  Bear.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Last we talked to you, you were very happy.  You had your hands on some asses. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  You were having a good old time.  We had your wife on the phone, and she hung up.  Yeah, she did.  So we need an update.  How's Bear and his life?  Well, when I spoke to her right after the show, the first thing she told me was,  make sure you bring home the cat food, you know, and not even how the show went.  Of course.  Cat food.  Enough with the cat food.  Yeah, bring home the cat food.  You don't know, you guys, that was great on Friday.  I am so looking forward to this. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, Bear, Bear.  How was it?  You were sitting on the couch.  There was a girl on either side of you that was letting you do whatever you wanted.  You were rubbing their shoulders, and then you went down to the hips,  and then at one point I just saw Bear's big hand just rubbing one of the girl's butt cheeks.  And you had to be loving it.  The bear was ready to get busy, believe me.  Oh, yeah, see?  Yeah.  See?  Sure he was. 
[02:06:00]  Those girls were gorgeous.  Yeah.  They were drop-dead gorgeous.  Yep.  Brooke and what was the other girl's name?  Do you remember?  Bunny.  Oh, Brooke and Bunny.  Yeah, they're really hot.  Yeah.  When are you going out there, Bear?  Where are you?  I don't know.  Oh, there's the picture.  There's one.  I don't know.  He's got his hands over their shoulders, and his one hand is gently almost sweeping a breast.  His look is a little creepy.  It's like, must kill.  Wife.  I was actually there last night for a couple of minutes, you know? 
[02:06:30]  Oh, you were remembering the scene?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  So he's using that as a little fantasy.  Oh, like Marge.  Like Marge, you have fantasy sex.  Sure he does.  Yuck.  There you go.  Oh, man.  This guy is going to be all wound up.  Oh, my God.  His shoulders must need cleaning.  Is it true your older daughter found out?  Yes.  And what's going on with that?  She's actually pretty cool with it, because she knows. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, God.  How old is she?  How old is she?  17.  Oh, okay.  Well...  And what'd she say?  Daddy, I heard you on the radio?  Or what?  Yeah, Daddy, I heard the show.  It sounds like you're going to have a good time when you go to Vegas.  Hmm.  And we discussed it a little bit.  She was like, Daddy, you know, you've got to live, too.  You've got to...  And she was very cool with it.  She really was.  That discussion sounds sexy.  It certainly does.  Nice to know everybody in the house knows that the mother walks around with ice cubes in her panties.  Frigid bitch. 
[02:07:30]  I think the Titanic hit my wife.  I don't think it hit an ice.  It hit my wife.  Yeah, but she's cool still with everything.  I'm sorry?  She's still cool with everything?  Oh, yeah.  You know, I mean, I get a dirty look now and then, but I'm used to that.  This is going to work out.  Yeah, this is going to be wonderful.  This is going to work out great.  It's going to work out great.  All right.  Anything else, Bear?  We just needed the update from you.  Everything is...  Everything.  I'm just so looking forward to this, and I want to thank you guys again.  You guys are the best. 
[02:08:00]  You're welcome, man.  Keep us posted, okay?  Bear.  Oh, definitely.  When you get out to Nevada, what's going to be the first thing you do at the...  What is it called?  The...  The Bunny Ranch.  The Bunny Ranch.  Well, I suppose...  He's still talking.  Oh, gee.  He's going to go...  Even though he knows you hung up, he just wants to hear himself say that.  Yeah, he wants to hear it said.  That's all.  We didn't get to this story.  It's on the cover of USA Today.  It really pissed me off today.  What, sweetie?  Well, I see a call coming in from West Palm. 
[02:08:30]  Craig says Bear's going to get screwed in the divorce, and it reminded me of this article.  It's on the cover of USA Today.  Should kids go to court in chains?  Debate intensifies over shackling of young defendants.  Handcuffs pin the teenage girl's wrists together.  The cuffs connect to a heavy chain around her waist so she can't raise her arms.  Another chain connects her ankles, shortening her step as she shuffles into the courtroom.  When she shifts in her chair, the shackles clink. 
[02:09:00]  Mel Yara Perez is 14, and yes, her mother says she is troublesome.  Mel Yara runs away and goes to school high.  Her mother tells the judge she's in court on a charge of grand theft auto.  But she shouldn't be in shackles, Myra Perez says.  I didn't like that.  Not at all.  She's not a criminal.  She is.  They just described a criminal.  Such sentiments are being heard in courts across the nation where there are increasingly vigorous  debates over rules that require metal shackles to be used on youths who appear at juvenile 
[02:09:30]  court hearings.  At issue is whether kids as young as 10 need to be shackled for court security, and whether  putting chains on young defendants not only makes them look like criminals, but also makes  them more likely to think of themselves in that way.  This is how we are out of control in this country.  Now we're trying to make court nice for people?  Just lock it.  Whatever.  You should feel like a criminal.  Yeah.  You should be frightening and uncomfortable.  Yeah.  I'm amazed we're even debating this.  This is the cover story on USA Today. 
[02:10:00]  We're debating this.  I'm sure there are certain circumstances that they think shackles are appropriate.  And yeah, like Jimmy said, it should be as uncomfortable and degrading and awful as  possible so that you don't do it again.  But there's that soft thinking that, well, if a kid, you know, skips school once, he shouldn't  be brought in shackles.  But when you're a problem and you're doing drugs and you're getting, you know, grand theft  auto charges, I'm sorry. 
[02:10:30]  Yup.  You got to teach him that that's bad.  Absolutely.  And if you do it again, you're going to be put in the situation.  Well.  And that's it.  I mean, it goes on and on.  They're arguing this case all over America and some judges are giving in and saying,  okay, yeah, we shouldn't shackle the kids.  That's good.  Yeah, that's really good.  Make their court experience a good one.  Make it nice.  Why don't you, why don't you, why don't you hand out cotton candy while you're out?  Yeah.  That way when they walk out, they could go, that wasn't so bad. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  You know, wow.  I thought it was going to be worse.  I think, I think I could get used to this court thing.  Nice.  If they don't shackle them then, they will in five years and they do something really  awful.  Yeah.  As adults.  Well, that's our music to cut us off on.  Oh, dang.  We could have, we could have done a little something on that.  Dagnabbit.  But, ah, whatever.  Well, uh, tomorrow we got to have Ben Kingsley.  Serbin.  Serbin.  Serbin. 
[02:11:30]  Serbin.  Serbin Kingsley.  I mean, um, Shinra.  Uh, Shinra.  Shinra.  Shinra.  Shinra.  Shinra.  Shinra.  Shinra.  Shinra.  Shinra.  Shinra.  Shinra.  Alright, guys.  Thank you.  For what?  Just for being you.  Oh, sweet.  It's a sweet sentiment.  And for Jones Beach, don't forget in two weeks, uh, two weeks from yesterday.  No.  Yesterday was Sunday.  Oh, two weeks from Saturday. 
[02:12:00]  It was past Saturday.  Twelve days from now, two weeks from past Saturday, we're going to be in Connecticut with the, uh,  the Traveling Virus, and, uh, there's going to be a bunch of us.  Ticketmaster.com, and we're going to be broadcasting up there.  Yeah, the Wolf.  The Wolf.  What's up to everyone listening to us on the Wolf?  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Opie and Anthony.  Backboard radio hosts. 
[02:12:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, enough with the ecstasy of gold.  I know.  How many times do we have to hear that fucking song?  Nine minutes long.  All right.  We get it.  We're epic.  I hope it's...  Jesus.  Ah, all dramatic so we can tell a few dick jokes.  That's pretty much the bottom line, isn't it?  With a...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:13:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  You know, can you turn it on?  These guys take themselves too seriously.  It's dramatic, dramatic, and then a fart sound clip.  Or a 30-minute riff on hot dogs.  I was to build with the hot dogs.  This Steve Carell movie is fucking annoying me.  It looks awful.  It really does look bad.  They're pushing the crap out of it, though.  Stupid Noah's Ark film.  I hope you make $11 at the box office. 
[02:13:30]  You know better.  I went to the movies recently, and I saw Knocked Up, which was eh, all right, I guess.  And the point I'm going to try to make here is they showed the preview for, what is it  called?  Bruce?  Evan Almighty.  Evan Almighty.  See?  What?  Evan Almighty.  Yeah, yeah.  Like Bruce Almighty, only with Evan.  I guess Jim Carrey was busy.  Well.  They should call this movie Jim Carrey was busy.  Was busy, so we had to make a sequel without him, so we made Evan. 
[02:14:00]  A sequel without him, and we're using a different biblical character.  But it's Morgan Freeman still playing The God.  Anyway.  Point I'm going to make.  Oh, yes.  So I saw the preview for this horse shit.  How funny would it be if we were still going out over the free FM?  You know, I can't get over it.  I'm really like sitting here kind of, gee, this is odd. 
[02:14:30]  But out there in Radioland, they don't understand what's going on.  They don't know, but we do.  Why don't we tell you?  It's still in the same studio.  We're doing a fake walkover so we could, like, do less radio.  I sat in the office and I had a bowl of cereal with blueberries.  And while everyone's thinking that we're, you know, that we have to walk from one studio  to the other, and it's this whole thing that has to happen.  Settle in.  Actually, we said goodbye to the free FMers, and I went back into our office and I ate 
[02:15:00]  some blueberries.  Blueberries.  And now we're exclusively on XM.  So that's it.  The Greg show.  I want to fucking.  Wait, can I finish my point?  Now we're on eight different things.  What point?  I'm sorry.  It's not even that big of a deal.  It should have been a quickie.  So they do the preview for this, Evan Almighty.  They show the entire fucking movie.  I don't need to see the movie anymore.  Granted, you know the story, but I didn't know this version, but now I do. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, Than, you want in on that?  Yeah, they have the trailer, and then they have sort of, the old trailer used to end  with this moment of doubt where his wife was being like, maybe it was a metaphorical  flood that's coming.  Uh-huh.  The whole thing.  He didn't actually build the ark because it was going to get flooded or whatever.  It was just God giving him a task or something, and that's how it ended.  But now they've added footage of him flying around the city in an ark.  Yeah.  So now you know the water does come.  Yeah.  Dude, they give away the entire.  Wow.  You thought maybe there'd be some weird twist, like he's just crazy or something. 
[02:16:00]  But you don't even have to see the movie.  That's to get the kids to go, to show all the animals in the ark.  That's so the children will want to go see it.  And the fact is, nobody cares about a story in a movie like that.  You don't care about how it ends or anything.  It's how funny the gags are.  Oh, I'm not going for the story.  I can understand the story.  It doesn't matter to me.  It's the funny gag.  Like action movies, they'll do the same thing because I don't care about the story.  I just want to see action. 
[02:16:30]  I used to like seeing previews.  I can't stand them anymore because they give away too much of the movie.  I don't even look.  All of a sudden, you know who the killer is and all this shit.  It's like if you just would have went to the movie Cold, you would have had a nice surprise.  Do you want to know how it ends?  I'll tell you how it ends.  He steps in elephant shit and then gets mouthfucked by an angry donkey.  I couldn't pick dog or donkey.  A dog donkey.  I don't have a dog just because Little Marge, Viagra.  Even a donkey with a bigger dick. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, good point.  A dog, you could survive.  But if a donkey got his hoofs up on your shoulders, gave you a good mouthfucking with your head  against the wood of an arc.  Dude, if a dog mouthfucked you, not only would you survive, you wouldn't even know what was  going on.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Well, depending on the dog.  If it was a bull nest, if you'd certainly know.  Yeah.  How would you know?  This fucking show.  This fucking show, I told you I've never hated anyone as much as Greg on CW11 here in 
[02:17:30]  New York.  He has a, he's a pretty boy, but he looks like he's too old to be a pretty boy.  Yeah, he is.  And he has fucking bleached blonde hair and just a douchey muscular head.  He has a muscular head.  Yeah, he's got a hairdo that should be on somebody that is younger and years ago.  And doing a video in 1988.  Yeah.  A-ha video from the 80s.  Yeah, there you go.  A-ha.  He looks like Dane Cook if Dane Cook was tired.  Yeah, yeah.  Dane Cook, like, too many, uh, too many, uh, tour, tour nights. 
[02:18:00]  Right.  For a year.  They should take off the name Greg and just put douche.  And that's Steve Carell.  Enough with this fuck.  We saw him interviewed and I've never seen a sweatier forehead on a person.  They just showed Al Roker, look at us bouncing around the TVs.  The guy lost, what, 400 pounds or something like that?  Yeah.  And he still has a, like, a fat pelican...  The waddle.  ...chin or what...  He's got a big wobble.  Neck.  He ought to wear, like, a fucking...  He ought to wear the hat that those guards in front of the palace wear, like a British  guard.  With a strap.  Yeah, hold his neck fat in. 
[02:18:30]  I would like if he wore a, uh, just one brassiere cup under his chin to hold his chin tit.  He has a big chin tit underneath his jaw.  Hey, how do I go to the phones now?  How do we do this?  We're doing it right now.  Well, I want to say hi to Julie and I want to know why Julie from Wisconsin is saying that  E-Rock told her she could come up and see the show today.  Oh.  Julie?  Yes, dear.  We're looking for Julie from Wisconsin.  Hi, Julie.  How are you?  Hi, Al. 
[02:19:00]  How are you?  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding, Julie?  Wow.  Uh-huh.  Where is Julie?  Uh-huh.  That's amazing.  Uh-huh.  And that's what E-Rock, uh, but what did he tell you at first?  He said that he was going to try to get us upstairs.  Why would he do that?  Because that's just the way E-Rock is.  Why would he tell Julie that?  She's not lying, is she?  Nah.  E-Rock.  Julie, you swear that E-Rock told you that?  I swear.  Yeah.  That doesn't make sense.  No, it does when you think about E-Rock. 
[02:19:30]  He would be able to say that.  There's about six of us from out of town down here.  No.  Just watch what happens.  Ben.  Stop.  So he promised.  What?  Did he promise it or just say it might happen?  No, he didn't promise.  He said he was going to check on it.  He asked you for a what?  Yeah.  No, that makes sense to me because it's E-Rock.  If it was anybody else but E-Rock, I wouldn't believe this.  Right, right, right, right.  So he basically told you if you blew him, and we can say it over here, that you would 
[02:20:00]  be able to come up and see the show live, right?  Hello?  He said he would try.  Oh, hi.  Where are you, Julie?  That's good.  Nice echo.  Hi, Julie.  Hi.  Where are you?  We're downstairs.  Are you hot?  Kind of.  All right.  Come on up.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  What?  I say let her come up.  Yeah.  I say let her come up.  Julie, you're hot, right? 
[02:20:30]  Sure.  Come on up.  And you're from Wisconsin.  What are you doing in New York?  I came to see the show last night, or Saturday.  Oh.  Saturday.  Saturday?  Saturday.  And you bumped into E-Rock.  Uh-huh.  And he said you can come up?  Wait.  E-Rock?  Mike?  Mike?  E-Rock's saying no.  What happened, E-Rock?  What's going on here?  Let's straighten this out.  No, I never said she could come up.  I said I would find out.  And I've been asking Steve yesterday and today, are we having an audience since we're not going  to the XM studio?  And he told me no. 
[02:21:00]  Is that what E-Rock told you?  Yeah.  Who are you with?  There's about six of us down here from out of town, from Montreal, Kansas, Sacramento.  Who are you with?  Myself.  That's it?  And you say you're hot?  Yeah.  Why don't we bring him up?  All right, Julie.  We have seats for you.  Only Julie's allowed up here.  Are there any other girls down there, standing there, waiting to get in? 
[02:21:30]  Just guys.  Tell the guys to fuck off, and one girl gets to come up.  Yeah, Julie, the easy broad, gets to come up.  How about this?  Why don't you come up, and if you're hot, we'll let them come up, too.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hey, that's fair.  Right?  All right, go get Julie.  Are you in front of the CBS building?  Yes.  Okay.  All right, Julie, we're coming to get you. 
[02:22:00]  Now, K-Rock, you told her she could come up?  No.  No.  So she's lying.  She asked if we were having an audience, because she came into town for the virus show.  Yeah, yeah.  I said, I don't know.  I would check.  Hey, uh...  We were told no.  All right, Julie, could you hang up on Julie?  I can't hang up on people.  There you go.  Julie, we're coming to get you.  Yeah, we're getting her.  Stay down there.  By the way, this just did.  You guys are still on K-Rock streaming, curses and all.  Yeah, I'm sure you are.  Not that I mind. 
[02:22:30]  They didn't figure out the internet thing?  That would be interesting.  Even though, you know, that's okay.  It's not covered by anything.  If we were over the air, do you know how fast Tom would have sashayed in here?  Oh, I know.  No, if it was over the regular airwaves.  But the internet stream...  Yeah, it's coming in like crazy.  Hey, Jackass.  Is it?  We're still listening to you guys drop F-bombs.  All over the place.  On the 92.3 free cast on the internet.  Okay, terrific.  That's fine.  Couldn't they just switch that over? 
[02:23:00]  I mean, that can't be, right?  Boy, they're getting a free commercial for that other company we work for.  This is what we do.  Did anybody notice that that money lady, Susie Orman, looks like David Bowie?  Ooh.  Now?  She's not on screen right now.  I thought you'd recognize her name.  I like how we just talk about television.  Well, I mean, I thought she was a famous person.  But that was not even a bomb.  You know what that was?  What, Jimmy?  That was somebody...  There was something that happened after that and somebody spliced it out. 
[02:23:30]  That's how dead the air was.  No one could believe that someone had just said something of such little value on a radio program.  That was almost what sound engineers call pure silence.  It really was.  Usually, it has to be in an acoustically sound room and everything.  But, no, that was pure silence.  That's the quiet you get when the audio people go, all right, quiet.  We've got to get the room vibe.  Room ambience.  Yeah, ambient sound for the room.  Hey, let's go to John in New Orleans.  John. 
[02:24:00]  What's up, John?  Hey, what do you got?  Hey.  What do you got to, boy?  Hey.  What do you got?  Hey, well, I came up from New Orleans to see the walkover, but I guess you're all on  having one.  Now, Danny's making a huge mistake.  Why?  What?  Why?  This girl is way not hot.  All right.  Well, let's see.  That's the beauty of it.  Now, you know, that might be your opinion down there in New Orleans, but, you know, maybe  we'll find her very attractive.  And, by the way, Danny did not make a mistake.  Danny did not make a mistake.  Enjoy the hilarity as we tell her she's a pig. 
[02:24:30]  Just tearing down a little wool for everybody right now.  I just want to see.  Yeah, that looks like David Bowie.  Whose opinion should we take?  Our own.  That's what I'm saying.  It'd be a different taste for people.  Maybe you don't find her attractive.  Maybe we will.  All right.  We'll see.  Thanks, John.  Oh, Julie.  What does coming up mean, though?  Like, does she have to go through the gauntlet to get into the studio? 
[02:25:00]  I think so.  Paperwork and all that crap, or does she come right in?  Now, what happens with Poe?  Is he over here now?  Nope.  Business as usual.  Nope.  That's what I'll say.  What does that mean?  Because if there's no shows going on over there...  Who's he guarding?  Then there's no security, no paperwork to fill out from guests.  Maybe we can call in and give us enough paper.  This is interesting, because I don't know what's going to happen now, because this person has to fill out paperwork. 
[02:25:30]  Steve still has to get the paperwork from Poe?  You're kidding, right?  Are you shitting me that this hasn't been thought of, that if we want to have a guest up here during this part of the thing that we need that paperwork?  You know, radio where spur of the moment's a good thing?  Holy shit.  You're kidding, right?  That's what I was just told.  From who?  Steve.  So that girl, who we spontaneously decide to bring up, is going to have to wait for the papers to come over from the XM building to here, to be filled out, and then she could come on so the spontaneity can just... 
[02:26:00]  All right, we got Danny.  How hot is she?  Well, let's just see.  I don't know.  All right.  Could you set up a mic over there?  Hold on.  Got a mic set up.  All right, here comes Julie from Wisconsin.  Take a little look-see.  Julie.  Here comes Julie from Wisconsin.  Back, back, back.  Sam, you might want to turn that camera on immediately.  Julie from Wisconsin.  Hey there, Julie.  How you doing?  Microphone, baby. 
[02:26:30]  You're from Wisconsin.  Yes.  Hello.  Hi, how are you?  Welcome to the show.  Now, so there were guys down there, right?  Yeah, there's like five other guys.  Five guys.  Yeah, I don't know guys coming up there.  But one of the guys called and said, Danny's making a big mistake.  Why?  And we were like, why?  He goes, because that chick ain't hot.  Now, I said there's many different, you know, tastes and things that appeal to people and guys and stuff. 
[02:27:00]  What did you say?  You were, when we said, are you hot?  I said kind of.  Kind of.  Okay.  Kind of.  Uh-oh.  No, no, no.  We're just asking for a clarification because we have to describe, whereas a lot of people don't have.  Right.  How old a gal are you?  33.  33.  You look a lot younger.  Thank you.  I got to say that.  And if you had to, for the audience, say a celebrity that you most resemble, who would you say? 
[02:27:30]  Jodie Foster?  Jodie Foster.  I could see that.  If she ate the real Jodie Foster.  Wait.  Oh.  Wait a minute.  All Faye.  All right.  No, no, no, no, no.  Wait a minute.  No, no.  I can kind of see that.  Yeah.  Like if someone stole Twinkies, you'd be the accused.  Hey.  Hey.  Don't trump my Jodie.  I'm just kidding.  A lot of calories have made contact with her lips. 
[02:28:00]  I know.  Silence of the ham chops.  I was going to go with silence of the hams.  You will let me know when those floorboards stop screaming.  Oh, my God.  How about you, Rob?  Get to IMDb immediately.  Oh, no. 
[02:28:30]  No, no.  Not.  No, we, um, I think that's, uh, you're about a size 14.  Yes.  Yes.  Damn it.  Um, so now you're from Wisconsin?  Yes.  Um, and what are you doing here, Miss Bimmel?  He said I can smell your condiments.  I came to save the straw on Saturday. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, and you saw it.  Don't mind the back of my head.  That's fine.  I'm sure people have seen the back of yours.  You know, are you into that or anything?  Sure.  Yeah, you're active, right?  Sure.  Good.  Cool.  Good girl.  Why don't, why aren't you facing her, Anthony?  Because I'm, uh, I'm, uh, usually face guests when they come into the studio.  I can actually see a Jodie Foster vibe, though.  I mean, we're teasing you, but there is actually a little bit of a...  Uh, Bert from Philly wants to know if, uh, Wisconsin is the land of 10,000 lakes because,  uh, you occasionally go for long walks in the woods. 
[02:29:30]  That's just hurtful.  Uh, yeah.  Come on, man.  Fat jokes, they're great.  I think you're very cute.  I do.  I definitely see a Jodie Foster.  I can, I wouldn't have thought of it, but I can see it.  I can see it.  Thank you.  Scott from Hobpog.  Old stealing home fries.  Um, someone's asking if you were the taxi and taxi driver. 
[02:30:00]  That would be Snap, man.  Holy cats.  The lambs were silent because she ate them.  Why, you people?  How about Nell, uh, Carter?  That's not nice.  That really isn't.  Um, how much, uh, how much, uh, how much, uh,  do you, uh, weigh and your height?  Um, 5'2".  5'2".  All right. 
[02:30:30]  It's not that you're...  5'2", eyes of blue?  Yes.  Ah, see.  She's not that fat.  No.  No, she's cute.  Oh.  We're teasing you.  She's got nice eyes.  She's got a little Irish in you, right?  Mm-hmm.  Very Irish.  What were you asking, Anthony, a question?  Did you ask 5'2"?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And what's the, uh, the big number there?  I mean, I'm just saying the number, you know.  Oh, 175.  Yeah?  You don't look 175.  Oh, Danny just slid a scale in front of her.  Well, it's going to prove our point.  Every girl, like, drops at 7... 
[02:31:00]  What do we guess?  7 to 10 pounds, right?  He slid.  It was kicking and screaming.  He pushed it.  Matt from New York City, Anna and the King-Sized Value Meal.  Oh.  That'd be nice to her.  Let's...  You want to...  Weighing somebody is kind of humiliating.  I like that one movie where she, uh, people break into her house and she runs into the picnic  room.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  No, the panic room.  Oh, shit, sorry.  That's the room with the empty refrigerator in it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, actually...  She's such a sweet girl. 
[02:31:30]  Actually, Chester's liver's got the joke.  Oh?  Whack bag.  Does she refer to a gym as a panic room?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, no.  That's not funny.  Basically, what they're trying to say is that you're fat.  Oh.  Oh.  They're hurtful.  How do they know?  It's fine.  It's not nice.  Yeah.  That isn't, uh, that isn't nice.  No, I...  No, no.  I'm reading.  It's not accurate.  You're very cute.  I mean, you do...  You should jump up on that, though.  Oh, fine. 
[02:32:00]  I bet you're not even 175.  There's no way.  I would have guessed, like, 150, to be very honest with you.  But I would have guessed 4.3.  All right.  All right.  Don't look down.  I love it.  Let's just prove what we talk about all the time.  Wait.  What does she claim to be?  She wants 75.  One 75.  Sam.  All right.  Wait.  Sam, why don't you tell her how much she weighs on?  But she's got clothes on.  Yeah.  You know what?  Well...  How much?  You weigh in at 191 pounds. 
[02:32:30]  191?  Well, she's got clothes.  Yeah.  Are you wearing a space suit?  Yeah.  A diver's suit from the olden days.  No.  Well, that's a little different.  That's just slightly different.  Usually they say take off five pounds for clothes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Are you wearing a suit, Art?  No.  No?  You got a boyfriend?  No.  No?  If you have five guys with you, are you tapping one of them? 
[02:33:00]  No.  Why?  Because they weren't with her.  They were just outside with her.  You came by yourself from Wisconsin?  You came from Wisconsin all alone to just see New York, or...?  Well, I came for the fire show.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Go give her a hug.  Why are you...  Why?  Give her a hug.  E-Rock.  See?  I'm emotional today.  Hot dog guy with the four kids.  This chick is flying across America to see us.  E-Rock, give her a hug.  I think you can touch hands.  Yeah.  Aw. 
[02:33:30]  Get a hug from E-Rock.  You know, give her a hug.  The two of you in the same boat.  Oh, my God.  Did you win tickets, or did you buy them?  No, I bought them.  You bought tickets?  Oh, gosh.  We bought...  Aw.  And did you pay for freight to get here, or what...  God, what airline did you fly?  Southwest.  Okay, cool.  Where did you stay?  In Freeport.  With friends, or...?  Freeport?  I know.  Wow.  Freeport.  I know.  Beautiful.  That's not a nice neighborhood.  Oh, she's a nice girl. 
[02:34:00]  Used to be.  Oh.  I'm sure you're a very popular girl, though, in Freeport.  They probably like you there.  Yeah, well...  Yeah.  The booty for it.  Mm-hmm, baby.  The blonde hair and the booty.  What kind of underpants?  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  You're wearing deer pelt?  Yeah.  Joe from South Jersey, because you're out there with, what, five or six guys?  They're all looking to come up here, too.  They weren't with her.  They just got pulled in by her gravitational field.  Now, that's ridiculous. 
[02:34:30]  She'd have to be as big as a planet.  Oh, wow.  For the actual gravity to attract people.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Jimmy's almost...  Hold on, Jim.  What kind of underpants do you have?  Oh, dear.  It's not a sexy answer.  Yeah.  Do you go with sexier kind of underpants?  No.  I don't.  No, you just go with basic...  Not old granny underwear, are they?  Can we see them?  Like with the big front panel?  You can't be naked up here.  They won't let you be naked.  Can we just see your panties?  I don't like the big panel front.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let's guess.  Oh.  There you go.  Those are kind of...  But they're kind of frilly around top, which is nice, you know? 
[02:35:00]  It's not like you're wearing men's underwear or something.  Right.  That's nice.  I'm just saying.  What do you do for work?  Yeah, what do you do?  I design cookbooks.  Oh.  It just feels better.  Perfect, right?  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  I know.  Under things to do with chocolate.  Wait a minute.  Cookbooks.  What's a cookbook suggestion?  Yeah.  I don't cook.  My girlfriend cooks.  A cookbook suggestion?  Like, what is one of your favorites? 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Like, what is a specialty of yours?  Our newest cookbook is the Taste of Home cookbook.  Yeah, where you actually eat a house.  That's the Taste of Home.  Oh, no.  No.  You design them, or you...  Yes, I'm a graphic designer.  Oh, graphic designer.  Yes.  Okay.  So what is...  I don't cook any food.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  So what do you...  It doesn't have that long.  No, no.  Forget it.  Do you design...  You design what? 
[02:36:00]  How do you, like, you lay out the...  Yeah, I get the recipes and...  Where the pictures go?  Yes, uh-huh.  And I make it look pretty.  Oh.  What, do you scream at the meatloaf?  Should be on this page and not that page?  Yes.  You incompetence.  You don't have anything to do with the photography part of it?  No, but we do have a photo studio in our...  Yeah, and they put the little grill marks and things with the little hot poker, thing like  that.  Yes.  And it brings back bad memories of the branding.  What do you mean? 
[02:36:30]  I mean, she's as big as a cow, and cows get branded.  Jimmy.  You ass shithead.  I'm teasing, of course.  To be as big as a cow, cows don't weigh 191 pounds.  Well, let's get her on all fours.  You've got to be a couple more than that.  Let's just get her on all fours, say.  I'm thinking more of a pig than a cow.  Do you...  Oh, no.  Do you...  No, this is not...  She's a sweet girl.  Stop it!  She's actually very sweet and very nice.  Awful. 
[02:37:00]  I love Pal Talk, too.  Yeah, we've seen your first...  I love Pal Talk.  Yeah, I love Pal Talk.  Well, we're searching for the hot girls.  Oh, shit.  What's your name on Pal Talk?  Ja-Ja Julie.  Yes, it's Ja-Ja Julie from Pal Talk.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Could have been Fuffa.  No.  Jimmy.  All right.  Ja-Ja Julie.  I don't know if I've ever seen you.  Do you date in Wisconsin, though?  Sure.  You go out?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  So guys like you and everything.  You're probably fun to be around and everything.  You've got a good personality.  Thanks.  What do you like to do? 
[02:37:30]  Uh, karaoke.  Do you?  You do karaoke?  That's fun.  Yeah.  What do you sing?  What do you sing?  What do I sing?  Uh, Dream On.  Let's hear it.  Right now?  Yeah.  I've actually always been very embarrassed to sing.  Yeah, can we get Dream On maybe in a jukebox?  She was getting me in the jukebox.  She was ready to belt it out.  A karaoke version or something?  A little water.  Do you need water?  Water.  All right, get her some water.  Get her some water.  I'm nervous, a little scared.  Yeah.  I've never been able to sing karaoke.  You like Dream On, huh?  Yeah. 
[02:38:00]  Just pick your own, folks.  Yeah.  Well, that's good.  Um, are you a good singer?  Somebody tells me you are, because when I say could you sing it, you were ready to go.  Yeah, she was ready to go, so that's good.  She could do it without music?  Getting her, uh, water.  Yeah, she doesn't care.  How long does it take to get a bottle of friggin' water?  I know.  Where are they going for it?  You don't mind the bottle, right?  We don't have a trough.  It's, uh...  I'll just let it out.  It's another awful joke.  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong with me?  I'll chip you nice.  There you go.  She is very nice. 
[02:38:30]  You eat a lot of cheese?  Sure.  Yeah, what's the problem?  Now, do you want to be a little thinner?  Yeah.  Were you bigger or smaller at some point in your life?  Smaller, of course.  You were smaller?  I've never been bigger.  What happened?  Depression.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  She's laughing through her tears?  Oh, I think you made one in the ground.  Jimmy.  Oh, so what did you weigh your lightest, like, not as a kid, like, you know, 
[02:39:00]  as your 20s or something, I guess?  About 140.  140.  Okay.  So you've always, like, been a little thick.  Just a little thick.  Why don't you take tits?  And then you got...  Yeah.  Well, they're...  How big?  They're 38Ds.  Yeah.  Let's see, like, something.  Don't show us.  They got a little...  Oh, they're nice.  All right.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  That was deceiving.  Okay.  Now I saw.  They're very firm.  But they...  Yeah, that's nice.  But then what happened?  Around when?  How old were you?  Probably about five years ago. 
[02:39:30]  Five years ago?  You got a bad breakup?  What happened?  Yeah.  He was abusive.  He was...  Oh, my God.  And then now we'll look at what we're doing.  Being abusive.  Well, how was he abusive?  He'd make fun of me and say I was fat and...  Exactly.  Oh, shit.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  That's fine.  Would he hit you or no?  No.  Oh, okay.  He was just mentally abusive.  Mm-hmm.  But you were this size when you were going out with him?  Yeah.  Well, I ballooned while we were dating.  Oh. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Why?  Yeah.  Because you were so happy in your relationship.  Oh, fuck.  How quickly that turns, huh?  Well, he was one of those guys that said that nobody else would put up with me and I'm  lazy, crazy, you know.  Wow.  You seem like you could be a cool chick, though.  What a bastard.  We're making you sad.  I'm a cool chick.  Yeah.  We're making you sad.  No.  I love you guys.  Jim from New Brunswick.  Wow.  Is John Hinkley Jr. going to shoot Ronald McDonald to earn her affection?  No. 
[02:40:30]  That's a great...  God damn it.  That was a good one.  Good reference.  That tied in with the Jodie Foster because he shot Reagan.  Yes.  Yeah.  In the McDonald's.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  It was just a wordplay.  No one is suggesting you should sing Cherry Pie instead of Dream On.  I want to hear her sing Dream On.  I bet you she has a lovely voice.  Sure.  I bet you do.  Boo Man from Brooklyn says he was abusive.  He unplugged the refrigerator in the back.  Another refrigerator joke.  Come on, guys.  Jesus. 
[02:41:00]  Go for the cabinets.  Twinkies.  Things like that.  Nothing.  Not everything has to be refrigerated.  That's right.  How about the pantry?  The pantry.  So, what are you doing?  Like taking Effexor or something?  No.  What did you say?  Lithium or...  I'm fine now.  That's a Fezzy's...  Effexor?  Effexor.  G.C.'s Pizza and Effexor.  Coke Logic.  Sorry.  He was abusive.  He limited her to three meals a day.  She's not that big. 
[02:41:30]  She's a little bigger than a girl, but not, you know?  No.  You know something?  You're one of those girls.  You're not like...  If you just kind of made a commitment there, you'd lose weight and you'd be cute and everything.  I'm not saying you're not.  I'm just saying like you'd be a slim girl.  She's got a nice smile.  You've got nice eyes.  Let's go around the room.  I'll go with the nice smile and the nice eyes.  Anthony?  Well, the eyes. 
[02:42:00]  Jimmy?  She has a sunny disposition.  All right.  Sam?  Sam?  Say something nice about Julie from Wisconsin.  Come on.  She dresses really well.  Yes.  Very clean.  You're not like messy fat.  No.  Messy.  Jeez, what a smooth talker you are.  Jesus.  You're open for Tony Robbins.  Nice hair color.  That's good.  Is that natural hair color?  It's highlighted. 
[02:42:30]  It's highlighted?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  But I am blonde.  Anything.  Anything to distract.  And she looks younger than her age.  I bet people think you're in your 20s all the time, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You look like a college age girl or something.  Just like Ope.  I see.  Hey.  I've been nice to you so far.  I love you, Ope.  What did she say?  She said, I said she looks college age.  And she said, just like Ope.  Yeah.  That's a compliment.  She was making fun of the fact that I might not be of college age. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, okay.  Because Ope's saying he is college age.  That's right.  I am.  Of course he is.  College age.  Great.  Well, I would love to hear.  Yeah.  A little odd.  Sorry.  Sure.  Aerosmith?  Sounds distracting.  Oh, I thought it was her.  I thought she couldn't wait for lunch.  Sorry.  Oh, come on.  I'm not going to make fun anymore.  No.  You can.  It's okay.  It's your job.  No.  I'm just teasing you.  No.  No more making fun.  Hey, could you, like, puke up food for us? 
[02:43:30]  What, do you want her to binge and purge?  Can you do that?  I'm not bulimic, no.  Oh, that stuff's cool.  Oh, damn.  That is good.  I'd be a lot thinner if I was.  I know.  Horses vomit more than her.  Oh, my God.  This is just mean.  All right.  Let's...  I'd like to hear you sing something.  Sure.  Are you going to have music or no?  Do you need it or no?  Oh, music?  Do you want music? 
[02:44:00]  Turn my music...  Turn like that?  Yep.  All right.  You got...  Well, but we like when only she hears it.  Yeah, it's fine.  We get...  It's kind of hard to do.  We don't have an Aerosmith CD around this joint?  That's what we're looking for.  Do you need the music?  No.  I can sing it if you guys want me.  Is it true that fat girls like, you know, like do a better job with the blowjobs than...  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  Try harder?  What's that about? 
[02:44:30]  Got to impress somehow.  No, let's get into this a little bit.  Deep into your head a little bit.  Do you like try harder?  Deep into your head a little bit, yeah.  Do you try harder because you're like, you know...  You were going to say fat.  It's not fat.  It's not fat.  Like, you're big.  I'm chunky.  Yeah, but you're not like...  You're not like this big fat girl.  Turn around sideways.  Let me take a little look.  All right.  Yeah, see, you're shapely fat.  You're like proportion.  You can still see like different body parts and stuff. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we were, you know...  We're hoping a big fat mess came in.  Were we?  Were we?  Or is this working out perfectly?  I mean, let's be honest with each other.  Be nice.  Were we really, Anthony?  I don't want to have her suicide on my conscience. 
[02:45:30]  This is just mean.  Yeah.  So you were in that bad relationship, and then how did it end?  Did you leave him?  Yes.  Yeah, you finally...  Finally had enough.  Got up and said, I'm out.  Are you a roller coaster enthusiast?  Oh, that's Chris, isn't it?  Yes, I am.  Really?  Yes.  Oh.  Yeah.  Do you work for the roller...  Uh-oh.  No, no, no.  He punched out.  Wait, he's going to get...  No, he's reloaded, though.  It was the...  He's reloaded. 
[02:46:00]  Do you work for the roller coaster strength testing corporation?  Oh, my God.  They call her the chain strain test.  Like when it goes upside down, the whole thing just dips.  I'm sorry.  You know how big you'd have to be to actually bend the steel of a roller coaster?  Yes.  So have you been to many roller coasters?  Yeah, I've been to 83 different parks.  I'm like...  Really? 
[02:46:30]  Mm-hmm.  Have you been to Coney Island?  Yeah, I went yesterday, actually.  Oh, you did?  Mm-hmm.  And you went on the Cyclone?  Mm-hmm.  And?  It was great.  What'd you think?  It was great.  I had a good time.  Pretty, uh, a lot of vibration on that one, right?  Yeah, I've ridden worse.  Really?  That's an old roller coaster.  Oh, yeah.  I've ridden, what, 308 of them.  Different ones.  Different ones?  Yeah.  Wow.  Mm.  Yeah, I'm one of them losers on the Travel Channel.  Wow.  That you see, those coaster freaks.  Yeah, the roller coaster enthusiasts that go everywhere.  You've tried how many roller coasters? 
[02:47:00]  308.  How many flavors of ice cream have you tried?  412.  How many did you want to go on, but the bar wouldn't go down?  Never.  I've never been turned away.  Oh, no?  Okay.  Just wondering.  Are people mad when, like, three cars behind you have to get off?  That was uncalled for.  That really was.  Why am I doing this?  I am, I am.  Well, now we got the roller coaster.  I don't doubt it.  Michael from East Brunswick.  They named Rolling Thunder after her waist. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, that's terrible.  Yeah.  You've been on, what's the scariest, like, roller coaster you've ever been on?  My favorite is at Kennywood Park.  It's called Phantom's Revenge.  Why?  Why is that a good one?  It goes 200 feet down the side of a mountain through another coaster and then comes back  up and around.  It's really cool.  Like, pretty straight down-ish?  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  Like that?  Wow.  Those things just petrify me.  I can't go on roller coasters.  Too scary.  Well, Reading from Whack Bag, they used the rolls on her belly to design the dips on the  roller coaster.  Why would they do that?  I've seen them engineer.  They use computers, Opie, to engineer them.  What's the longest line you've ever waited on?  Four hours.  Wow.  Did you hear the roller coaster audio we played this morning?  It was a concession stand.  No, I just heard it.  No, I missed it. 
[02:48:30]  You want to hear it?  Sure.  I'm just lying.  People saying it was the buffet.  Oh, is that horrible?  People in my club are just as bad as pests.  You have a club?  Yes.  Really?  Yes.  A roller coaster club?  Yes.  The American Coaster Enthusiasts.  There's about 8,000 of us crazies.  And you still can't get laid?  Wow.  I'm not getting laid.  How many people have gone on?  You've gone on 308. 
[02:49:00]  What are some long-term enthusiasts?  How many have they gone on?  Oh, I know people that are in the 500, 600s.  They've gone to Europe and Japan.  Pounds?  Oh, no.  Times on the roller coaster.  Sorry.  Not that.  Now, I'm going to play you a British reporter screaming, because you can't take roller coaster.  I'm not going to play the whole thing, because, quite frankly, the setup is boring.  Yeah.  Why are they whispering over there?  Why are they whispering over there? 
[02:49:30]  I don't know.  I hear them whispering.  Wait, you waited four hours in line?  Yeah.  Someone is asking, I guess it's Schticks from Wagbag.  Who did you find to serve you breakfast, lunch, and dinner during the wait? 
[02:50:00]  By the way, that was the wrong audio you queued up.  Oh, wow.  That was the woman whose foot you stepped on.  Julie, from Wisconsin.  Because you're the fat one.  It's terrible.  Just in case you're trying to figure out the humor.  Julie is not that big.  We're being stupid, and you know that.  Really?  You have an awful show we do.  Might want to get class.  So, that's pretty cool, though.  A lot of roller coaster.  You must travel a lot, then.  Oh, yeah.  A lot.  Yeah.  Those are all over the place. 
[02:50:30]  What are you looking for out there on the road?  I just like to have fun with friends.  I meet people on the internet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're definitely an internet chick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You ever go out with some real weirdos?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  They hook up, and you just meet them somewhere?  Yeah.  Oh, you're one of those chicks that just bangs?  No.  No.  Well, you meet guys on the internet, and then you bang them.  I didn't say I banged them, sweetie.  Blowjobs? 
[02:51:00]  No.  Anus?  No.  Handy?  No.  Just chatting about roller coasters.  Yeah, pretty boring.  Wow.  I bet they want a finger that took us.  I bet they want a little more, though.  Running from Wackbag said, the noise you just heard was the girl in studio, that would  be Julie, walking into the produce section of the supermarket.  Why don't we play that audio again, and then we can guess what the audio is.  Uh, okay. 
[02:51:30]  I had to find it again.  I'm sorry.  Oh.  If you have something, raise your hand.  Or write it on instant feedback.  Oh, Jimmy.  That was Julie's floor.  All right, a little, like, warm-up pitch.  Very good.  Oh.  Oh, Julie's got one.  Is that what it is when I see lettuce? 
[02:52:00]  Oh.  See?  Oh, it's not as much fun.  See?  When the fatty's in on the joke.  No.  Don't.  The fatty.  I know what that is.  Uh, yes, Jim.  When E-Rock and Julie saw each other, and both thought they were looking into mirrors.  What do you think of them apples?  That's right.  You're still fast.  Oh. 
[02:52:30]  Shut up, my eyes.  I don't like it.  I believe that's the voice of the elevator getting Julie up to our studio.  Evan's guessing from Cincinnati.  Is, uh, is that the voice of one of the guys she met on the internet?  Uh, uh, that's, uh, that's not right. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  Uh, someone's guessing.  That's, that would be Tug from Pal Talk.  I think that was Julie finding out that Baskin-Robbins was close for the night.  Well, um, are we gonna, are we gonna get to the singing?  Oh, oh.  Can you play another second next?  I think I have it.  Oh.  All right.  Goodie.  I know what it is.  Jodie Foster, ten minutes ago. 
[02:53:30]  Yep.  Could you eat better?  Is that what it is?  Do you think you could eat a little better than you do?  I'm starting to, yeah.  Are you?  Oh, good.  Yeah.  And are you exercising at all?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  What do you do for exercise?  Oh, good.  I walk.  Cool.  Oh, yeah, that'll burn calories.  If you got 50 years old.  I want to see, I want to hear you sing.  I want to hear you sing.  That's just...  Someone is saying, is that the noise of, of Julie's toilet?  No, that's not the sound of Julie when she found out that McDonald's took away the McRib 
[02:54:00]  sandwich.  Oh, you can do it for every food group, I think.  I know.  We get the joke.  God.  Someone is suggesting that would be no kid to a monkey.  That was the sound of all the passengers on the plane.  Don't you want a lot to fly out to New York? 
[02:54:30]  That was the sound of the Chinese buffet owner seeing Julie pull up.  That's, uh...  Yeah.  That's terrible.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  It's terrible, but I'm sorry.  How long have you been listening to this program?  A little over a year.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Why only a year?  Well, I was going to get a serious unit.  And, um, my friend convinced me to listen to you guys instead, so I got hooked. 
[02:55:00]  The friend now has to be known as that asshole.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Did you get this one because you thought, actually, you misread the label and you thought  it said XL?  If she got the serious unit, though, she would have got her workouts in.  Absolutely.  Just carrying the radio.  Oh.  I get it.  Can we hear, can we hear?  Yeah, all right.  I was stalling.  A little singing.  Do we got the dream on for the thing?  I don't know.  No dream on for the thing?  She doesn't need the music.  She doesn't need it, she said. 
[02:55:30]  All right.  Then start singing.  All right.  Sing for your supper.  Jesus.  There was a...  What song?  Dream on?  Okay, dream on.  Dream on.  Every time that I look in the mirror  All these lines on my face getting clearer  The past is gone  I have to jump to it.  And when my life does to dawn 
[02:56:00]  Isn't that the way  Everybody's got the dues in life to pay  I know nobody knows  Where it comes and where it goes  I know everybody's in  You've got to lose and know how to win  Do you want more?  Wow.  It sounds like the female version of Pearl Jam  Eddie Federer  No, you know something? 
[02:56:30]  Acapella, she's singing  I agree  Takes some set of balls  I think you did fine  Thank you  All right, E-Rock, what call?  They left?  E-Rock said there was someone  Somebody good on the phone  What did they have?  He said it's the sound of the Kittner boys  Spilling out over the dock  And people want to know  If it's over  Yeah, that one takes only a couple of seconds to sink in 
[02:57:00]  But fuck, is that funny?  What a bunch of assholes  We are  What can I say?  You know, she's come up here  She's all fun  She does have a great personality  And she's singing and everything 
[02:57:30]  How the hell can you goof on her?  And she likes roller coasters  What else do you like?  It's a roller coaster club  She's got a pretty good job, I guess  That sounds pretty good  Graphic designer for cookbooks  Yeah  So you know what looks good or doesn't look good  I'm a photographer, too  Yeah?  What do you take pictures of?  Roller coasters  Really?  Yeah  Ew  I take portraits and stuff, too  God, that must be so boring at your house  Here's an album  Oh, this one's great  Look at the loop 
[02:58:00]  Yeah  There's a friend that's a fan of the show  He takes more pictures than I do  It's thousands and thousands of pictures  Why do you like roller coasters?  Is it because it would go, like, you know, 140, 170, 155, 195?  Yeah  No?  I know what you're doing  Wow, did someone go really obscure?  I think maybe this is for 10 people, but it is good  Chris K. from Wisconsin  If Opie and Julie are both college age 
[02:58:30]  Then Julie is the cleanup crew for Bomb the DK House  Oh, very good  Marshmallow joke  Very good  Sounded like Todd Rinking  Hey, can you do Chubby Bunny for us?  Sure  We have some Chubby Bunny marshmallows  Wow  We haven't done Chubby Bunny in a while  I gotta pee  We're just trying to do stuff with you  Yeah  Because you're fun  Yeah  Fun girl  Chubby Bunny 
[02:59:00]  So we take marshmallows  Well, she'll take marshmallows  And put one at a time, a marshmallow in her mouth  And say Chubby Bunny  Yeah  And then another marshmallow, Chubby Bunny  And then you see how many she could actually get in her mouth  While still being able to say  Chubby Bunny  Bunny  And we'll do it after the break  Someone's saying we should use actual bunnies  Someone on Instant Feedback is asking 
[02:59:30]  What was the deal when Kenny thanked people at the end of the show?  Did he have it written on a post-it?  There was a panic that was going on backstage  Because we had to get out of there by, what, 11 o'clock?  Stephen Lynch went late at Jones Beach 
[03:00:00]  And Kenny pretty much had to run on the stage right when Lynch ended  We had like 90 seconds  Or they were going to charge us a ridiculous amount of money in overtime  Yeah  That would pretty much fuck up the whole tour  Because we really don't have much of a budget for this thing  Right  So that's why the show kind of ended very abruptly  That was the only thing I wish we did a little better  But the fact is we had to get off the stage by 11  Or the, you know, they get like crazy overtime money 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, they penalize you  So it was just a quick  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you  Good night, good night, good night, good night  All right  Anything else, Julie?  I thought I was going to do Chubby Bunny  Yeah, Jimmy does a little  No, okay, that's fine  No  Yeah  You're wrong  We made enough fun of you  Can I have a marshmallow?  Can I have a little marshmallow?  Chubby Bunny  I hate marshmallows  Do you?  Yeah, if you're going to have good  They're very sugary  No, if you're going to have goodness 
[03:01:00]  You've got to like  Ice cream, chocolate  Why waste  Why waste like  They're mostly air  They suck  Julie, would you like one?  Sure  I'll have the whole bag  Do you like them, really?  You like marshmallows?  Can we throw marshmallows at you?  Sure  No, you missed  How can you miss?  Oh, Jesus, Opie  I'm a big target  Oh, fuck  Don't mess with me  Oh, he nailed her right in the face  Don't mess with me  Holy shit 
[03:01:30]  I've had enough of you  Oh, give her a marshmallow to eat  Jesus Christ  Right in the fucking mouth  You heard the thud on the radio  Pat really made a thud  When it hit her in the mouth  All right  Oh, boy  I'm very distracted  Because I'm moving today  And  It's moving day  Kenny's already in my house  Packing boxes  Why is Kenny  Packing boxes?  He's probably scraping mold  To bring with him 
[03:02:00]  I like to eat it, G.H.  Good stuff  Today is moving day  Finally, yes  Out of the crap hole  But Kenny's already over there  Kenny is moving?  Well, if you haven't figured it out yet  Kenny needs a few extra bucks  So, you know  I give him a few extra bucks  To do a few things  Pay him to suck your dick  Like I do  Wait, wait 
[03:02:30]  Doesn't Kenny get paid  For being with us  Until a certain time?  No, not today  He's done at nine  Oh, is he always done at nine?  Yeah, absolutely  I was going to say  If he got paid to eleven anyway  Then you're using him to move  But he's being paid  From another company  Boy, that would be the first time  We broke the rules, huh?  Don't blow up his spot  I'm not blowing up his spot 
[03:03:00]  I'm blowing up yours  XM pays him  And he's not even here  He's toting that barge  And lifting that bale  Yeah  What is there to move?  Not much, actually  I'm throwing  What is he, tying it  On the top of his truck?  Oh, we got like  We got clothes  What did you get to move it in?  Did you get a truck?  Or is it just  Yeah, we got a truck  Kenny's truck  Oh, you got the old U-Haul or something 
[03:03:30]  A rider truck or something  You should have made Kenny carry it  Down the street  On his stupid back  Do you remember  Remember when we did that gig downtown  At the electronic store?  Yeah  I picked up a flat screen  Like a 40-inch flat screen  I think it was  I don't know  Because I haven't seen it  It's in Kenny's garage  Half my stuff is in Kenny's garage  And he actually carried it  On the subway  Remember?  Oh, right  We left the store  And he actually carried it  I've never seen 
[03:04:00]  It was one of the most amazing things  I've ever seen  I'd love to see somebody  Try to rob him of that thing  He carried it like this  Just his arms stretched out  As far as he can  And he carried it onto the subway  That would have been a blast  Hey, give me the TV  Oh, yeah?  Sir, you can't have this  It's GH's  Why didn't you just take a cab?  I don't remember  Good idea  I think we couldn't get a cab  It was around Christmas time  There was a reason for it  And then we were on a crowded subway  And this monster is carrying this massive TV 
[03:04:30]  Eyebrow transplants  Yes  I thought you were just blurting out words  No, I got a note  You want us to excuse Julie  Oh  Shit, I forgot she was even back there  I thought it was the wall  I'm teasing  Stop  Might as well  Julie was very nice  Did you have fun?  We were just teasing  Do we have a prize closet  Where we can give her some lovely 
[03:05:00]  Not the marshmallows, Sam  Although she'd probably love those  Jodie Foster  I can see it  I was also thinking of the Jodie from Amityville Horror  Jodie Foster  If she was having like an allergic reaction  No  To food  All right, come  All right, Julie  Yeah  Do you want to stay?  Guys, yeah  All right, what are you going to do to stay?  What do you want me to do?  Would you shit in Sam's mouth? 
[03:05:30]  No, Sam, you're not into that  It's where you draw the line, finally  It's actually healthier than what he normally eats  Yeah, what did you eat today, you infant?  Well, yesterday  We like asking him what he had for dinner  What he had for dinner  Sam's diet is the same as an 8-year-old  I swear, it's the same diet as an 8-year-old boy's diet  Fish sticks, little things like that  What did you have?  Well, this morning for breakfast  I had chicken fingers 
[03:06:00]  On the car ride in to work  Chicken fingers?  Yeah, because sometimes my mom will make some extra ones  You know, if I go over to my mom's house  She will have made some extra chicken fingers  This is like Adam Sandler  Adam Sandler was talking about food  All right, yeah  So you had chicken fingers last night, too?  No, last night my dad put a chicken breast on the barbecue  Oh, wow, that's a treat  Corn and baby carrots with that  Nice  And a slice of milk  But that didn't make you happy  A glass of milk  No  He doesn't like grilled chicken 
[03:06:30]  Why so much milk?  It's healthy  It fucking tastes like shit, though  That's a slimy prattle  I like milk  It sucks  Milk is cow urine  Milk's good in cereal  I like that cow urine  But milk's good when you need it for something  Like a bowl of cereal or something like that  But in a glass by itself  It's like  It's coming out of a fucking big fat pouch near a cow cunt  Why would you drink it?  Fucking milk sucks as a beverage  Have a burger and some milk, please  Fuck yourself 
[03:07:00]  I'll have it in cereal  Because that's the only way humans should have milk  Milk is  Yeah, in cereal, that's it  Milk is a cow's liquid shit  It really is  Yeah, it's disgusting  Cow mucus  Right  It should be sucked out by a little cow  It's cow snot  How you wouldn't drink milk out of a woman's breast?  You wouldn't just walk up and start sucking milk out of a woman's breast  Yet you'll fucking drink it from an animal  That's like fucking an animal 
[03:07:30]  You ever think of weird shit when you're high?  Like, I mean, I used to get high  Yeah  And  Someone had to figure out that cow milk thing  Yeah  Like, what the  Fuck, man  How sick was that individual?  That's gotta be good stuff  How sick was that individual?  Well, they probably  I always think whenever you think of odd food and people eating it  Right  That, okay, whoever it was  Was either starving or dying of thirst or something  And they see  No, a pervert invented milk 
[03:08:00]  You think a pervert?  Or was it somebody that  Absolutely  That saw the young nursing  And  I know  And thought, like, maybe that's good  Give me the details on how they discovered milk  I actually know how they did  Shut up, Jimmy  I do  Okay, Jimmy  All right  In Rome  It was in Rome  Romans were the first ones to actually drink milk from cow  And there was a bunch of Romans  And they had boxes of cinnamon toast crunch and kicks  And nothing to put them in  And normally  They would have the urine of slaves  But there were none around  So let's get that slimy shit leaking out of the fucking cow tits 
[03:08:30]  Fucking  Who drinks fucking milk like a beverage  Sam  Any type of beverage  That when you fucking put the glass back  It's still the outline of the beverage on the glass  It's all just sliming down the side of the glass  Yeah  Dude, but think about it  Like, someone either had to jerk off the cow  Or suck on that thing  To discover milk  Yeah  There's no other way around it  They probably sucked on it  Because a lot of animals have their young sucking on something on them, right? 
[03:09:00]  Yeah  But someone decided, wow, that udder thing is kind of erotic  Well, they probably tried to  I gotta jerk that off  And then they got a little on their hand  Licked it off  Here they go  Wow, I discovered milk  They sucked on it  And went, holy shit  I'm totally full  But I want more for later  How can I do this?  Right  So then figured out how to get a container  And squeeze it  Like they were sucking on it with their hand  But now you're jerking off the cow  Yeah, you're pretty much jacking the udders  You ever see how they get milk?  And this was before machines 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, well now they just hook them up to machines  So they had to get the town perverts  To get the milk out of the cows  They got that fucking hand motion  Make you cum in about three seconds, I bet  I bet you get  You get some old farmer that's been milking cows  He'll jerk you off  In like two seconds, you'll shoot a load  No, he wouldn't  He'd fucking yank your dick down or too much  My dick bends up  Snap it  If I have a fucking rod  He'd probably yank it all down  Hey, why are you crying, little fella?  That's the wrong way, Tex  He's jerking your dick with one  And your ball sack with the other hand 
[03:10:00]  Yank it, yank it, yank it  No gentleness  He's used to a big farm animal  That's so stupid  It won't even run when there's a fire  I'm a guy  Could you fucking ease up with the gloves?  Cows just stand there and burn  They're dummies  That's who you're drinking  The fluid  The viscous-y fluid  Out of a fucking big Polak  That won't even run  Stupid Packers fan  Oh, fuck  That's a fucking hooved retard 
[03:10:30]  Standing there  Cows don't even resist  If you jerk a horse off  You better have technique  A fucking cow  Anybody can do  Anywhere, anytime  You can just grab milk  Yeah, they don't care  They don't even care  Colin from Tampa  Says his wife and he  Had this conversation yesterday  Yeah?  Yeah, let's talk to Colin  What a marriage they must have  Colin, what's up?  Hey, my wife and I  Were having this conversation  Yesterday  That you get milk from a cow 
[03:11:00]  And a goat  But that's it  All mammals give milk  But we only drink cow and goat milk  Yeah, because someone found those udders attractive  And decided to start sucking on them  Thinking it was some woman  Because there was no women around  I'll tell you why  Because we get fucking milk from things  And aren't going to buck and kick our gums out  I'm sure somebody tried to get milk from a wolverine at one point  Or a fucking porcupine  It might be the tastiest milk on the planet 
[03:11:30]  But we gave up trying  Wolverine  We gave up trying  Alright, let's think about it  Jim's right in that respect  But also you need something of some substantial size  Because it would be very  A slow process  And very tedious  To try to milk a wolverine  Alright  How about a blue whale?  Somebody got thirsty  Once they saw a blue whale on its back  And tried to squeeze its nipples  And tried to squeeze its teats  I'm trying to squeeze its whale teats  To get myself a beverage 
[03:12:00]  But I can't because  It's capsized the boat  And crushed all of my sailing mates  Okay  How about like a moose?  Moose milk  Moose milk  I don't know  Moose  They're pretty nasty animals  I know  But there's got to be a way  You can hold down that bastard  With his antlers  Or whatever the fuck those things are  I guess they got to be like  Cows are pretty domesticated animals  Yeah  They'll just wander around the field  When you milk them  Their head is locked in some fucking metal thing 
[03:12:30]  And they just keep eating  Yeah  They're just eating hay  While this machine hooks up to them  And they don't give a shit  You're right  So a moose would probably be pretty pissed  A moose would be causing a ruckus  A ruckus  Some type of riot  A wolverine  That's hilarious  So Colin  Colin  So what  A fucking porcupine  Or a piranha  Somebody tried to get piranha milk one time  Colin  The mammals  Only mammals 
[03:13:00]  How about bat milk  You think somebody ever stood in a cave  And tried to milk a fucking bat into a glass  And then ammonia piss got in his eye  And he fucking  He amscrayed  Colin  So what did you guys decide on the milk?  Uh  I guess it was  Enough about the milk Colin  What?  I guess it was just because of the size  Because you know  And domesticated  Because pigs should give milk too  But  Can we get rid of Colin?  Yeah please  I'm sure pigs do  Pigs right  I need control 
[03:13:30]  They're hanging up on these zero pigs  I'm sure they do  Alright  Um  Lobsters  No  Lobsters don't give milk  They're crustaceans  Just sit there while you fuck  They even burn them to death  And they just kind of take it  But here's the bit  And I don't think I've ever heard this bit before  By the way  There's a lot of things that are tasty  And  And you gotta think that the weirdos discovered this shit  Cause who would ever look at a lobster  It looks like a bug  It looks like a bug  And go wow  That's gotta be tasty  It really is a prehistoric monster  And then somebody said  That needs butter on it  How do you know there is meat? 
[03:14:00]  Right  How do you even know there's any animal in it?  Like how the fuck  You would think it's just like  That it's hard all the way through  I mean would you have that?  Would you have a mollusk chaser?  A mollusk?  Let's enjoy a few mollusks while we're here  I'm gonna have a crustacean  Followed up by a mollusk  I'd like a mollusk  And I'd like for dessert  Some Komodo dragon shit  Could you take the diuretic evacuation  Of a Komodo dragon  And smear it on a plate for me? 
[03:14:30]  A mollusk is a  Isn't that a mussel?  Wouldn't a mussel be a mollusk?  I don't know  Or a clam  Is that a mollusk?  How about you look at those oysters?  Who the fuck decided that's gotta be tasty?  Who's eating  Like mussels are disgusting  It's snot  It is shelled snot  There's orange in there  There's a black  And people slurp that shit up  Yeah  Why?  I don't even like shrimp anymore  Cause that little black line  You gotta get it deveined  They say it's a vein  Deveined  It's their shit 
[03:15:00]  It's their colon  It's shrimp shit  Shrimp shit  Next time you're on the road  Make Kenny devein your shrimp  Does he devein shrimp?  I'll make him devein it  And then eat all the little brown veins  All the little shit spaghetti  Eat all that shrimp shit  That's what you get  Put that on your peanut butter and jelly sandwich  By the way you guys  Have some peanut butter and shrimp shit  You know  I love Pot Talk  It's Pot Talk Monday  Yeah Pot Talk Monday  Pot Talk Monday  Travis is keeping track 
[03:15:30]  It's Pot Talk Monday  I don't know his name  Oh okay  Luke in Nebraska  Hold the antlers  Why the hell would you milk a male moose?  Of course  I only got one udder  One hard udder  You have to put in your mouth  And the fucking  And then all of a sudden  The moose gives you some milky  Get some fucking milky  Have some milky from the moose  Grab his fucking  Hey man  His one hard udder  But someone had to try it  But someone had to try it the first time 
[03:16:00]  Yes  And realize that wasn't a girl  You don't know  There might be some goodness in there  For the sake of the planet  Someone had to try  Fucking six shots of moose milky  Right down your gullet  You ever see a horse come?  It's obscene  I'm sure mooses come just like that  Moose milky  Anything with hooves  It's a giant load  I'm sure you would get the village idiot  To try  You know  Milking a moose  To see if it had moose milky  That's the rule of thumb  If you have hooves  You're going to have gallons of cum  It's fucking in this order 
[03:16:30]  Horses  Moose  And the Jersey Devil  Those things all fucking  Moose milky  Is going to make me laugh all day  But someone had to try it  Dude man  You know  That was so funny  It was a  It was a  A new world out there  You had to try everything  You had to try  To milk the moose  Yeah  For some milky  Hey why don't you just  Why don't you just  Jerk a retard off into a glass 
[03:17:00]  And slug that down  Find a boy with down syndrome  Or Eric Logan  When he gets a haircut  And fucking jerk him off into a cup  And fucking swig that down  With your fucking  Child food  How about  Fish sticks  How about  Joe from New Hampshire  The phones  You got to figure it out  So I can answer them  Yeah  This sucks  No I don't want to go to Joe now  Because it wrecks the timing  But I want to say this  Joe from New Hampshire says  First guy to milk a bowl guys  Yeah yeah  Someone had to try 
[03:17:30]  Because they kind of look like cows  They look like cows  A little  You want to go underneath  And then you look and go  Well where are the udders  I only see one thing  Let me maybe get something out of there  So you start tugging and tugging  And then before you know it  You're getting a lot of milky  Yeah and it doesn't  No one would mistake that for a cow  Cows are docile  Fucking idiots  With big gums  You don't go to fucking milk a cow  And all of a sudden  It fucking  It jabs its fucking  Little horns in your stomach  And go  That's not the same creature  When you see 
[03:18:00]  You see the thing with the horns  Pumping a load  Into the docile thing  You know which to milk  And which to fucking  Stay away from  Let the fucking PRs chase that thing  With big red capes  And I'll fucking milk this thing  For a beverage  Dan from Arizona  Who decided  Let's go to Dan  He's got to go on  Dan  Hey guys  It's Pot Talk Monday  Me and my wife  Were talking the other day  And we were wondering 
[03:18:30]  Who was the first guy  That looked at a chicken  Crap an egg out  And then say  I'm going to eat that  Who's your wife  Seinfeld  What else did you do  Did you wonder why  The socks have a little  Hanger with them  Shut up  What do they have  A little sock closet  At home  Your wife are hacks  Well what about  What about eggs though  They're like  They're like fetuses  That still have the sperm  Swimming around  Parlin had the best line  About eggs  He said  You ever  You crack an egg  It's hen cum  That just fertilize an egg  Or fertilize 
[03:19:00]  It's a non-fertilized egg  Wait  An egg from a chicken  That you eat  Isn't fertilized  Yet  You can't get the rooster  To fertilize that  Or else it's fucked up  Then you get  What  Then it's not an edible egg  Then it gets crunchy  It gets fucking that blood  In it  How do they fertilize the eggs  The rooster does that  He fucks the chicken  Yeah  And then what happens  To the eggs that we eat  They're non-fertilized  Impossible  They just come out  Of a chicken  It has shell  Yeah  So it's already fertilized  Inside there 
[03:19:30]  No  No  There's nothing  Fertilized in there  It's just the  Little  Yolk  That's what happens  When a rooster  Fucks a hen  In the shitter  The fucking eggs  Have to come out anyway  But they got no seed in them  They just fucking  Empty things with yolk in them  He's got an asshole  Full of fucking rooster seed  Stupid rooster  Get over eager  And missed it  Is it chicken  Cummy cum  It's like a chicken  It's like a chicken's period  Is what an egg is  Oh alright  They're having their period  If someone had  You know  Figured that

[03:21:00]  Jerking off into a frying pan  And see what that looks like  Just turn it with a spatula  And you know  If you want to drink milk  There's silver dollar hot cakes  Coming up  Just like Grammy used to make  Why did grandpa  Always look tired  After we  Well no  It tapers  Silver dollars  Down to nickels  And then dimes  I wonder if anybody ever  Back in the old days

Because I wanted to see  What was in there 
[03:24:30]  Who was hiding something  I knew tissues  When you blew your nose  Were just like  Crumbled up tissues  Or stuff like that  Or if you were using it  To do anything else  It would just be a little wad  Kind of crumbled up  And thrown in the garbage  This was rolled up  So I unrolled it  And as I'm unrolling  I noticed a few flecks on it  A few bloody specks  And I'm like  What the  So I keep unrolling  Now I'm worried  What it is  That maybe someone  In the house is hurt  Little Anthony's  Ready to start crying again  Someone got hurt

I don't know  Their idea of marking  Their territory  Is shitting and going  There from here over to here  That's mine 
[03:31:30]  They don't have sense enough  To fucking shit somewhere  They're not gonna step in it  They sleep in it  They're fucking awful  Animals suck  I would love people  Just to kill all animals  And laugh at them  Fucking dummies  The only animals  That should live  Are ones that actually  Take paper  And clean their assholes  We should leave wet naps  Out in the woods  And any animal  That uses one  To wipe his asshole  Lives  Is saved  But anything that shits  And then just walks  And shits on the back  Of their ankles  Has to fucking go  That includes 
[03:32:00]  Fucking aphids  And eagles too  Dude a dog  Will walk around  With his own shit  On his paw  For days  Of course he will  He doesn't care  He just doesn't give up  Trying to get a  Caked piece of shit  Off his ass  With that tooth thing  They do  Where they go  And then they lick  And chew more  Make that  Their upturned nose  Like they're growling  Only they're chewing  On themselves  And then  More licking  Of their own shit  Off of themselves 
[03:32:30]  Wonderful  Give mommy kisses  All people  Should enter the woods  With arrows  To just fucking kill  Every living thing  Everything that's  Alive  That shit  Should just be  Fucking executed  Stupid animals  Holy shit  And we don't even  Clean them up  Just leave them there  As a lesson  To the other shitters  What do you know  We gotta do  We gotta build  Toilets in the woods  And if you're caught  Not using it

[03:44:00]  I only thought of him  Because  He said something  About going down  In a girl's pussy  And it smelled like  Snossages down there  Snossages  We have a trucker  That's hauling cow lips  Cow lips  Get the fuck out of here  Give me John the trucker  I have one of those in my hair  John  That's a cow lick  Help Jimmy  I'm down  I'm down here at the Mexican  Hey we got John on the phone  John what's up  Yeah I'm down here 
[03:44:30]  At the Mexican border  Unloading 40,000 pounds  Of beef lips  Why?  Because Mexicans  Like to make tacos  Out of cow faces  I guess  I don't know  Wait you're in Mexico?  They're probably not  They're probably making wraps  Beef lips  Are you in Mexico?  No I'm in Laredo Texas  At the Mexican border  Good phone  Yeah that's close enough though  Careful  Are they ground up  Or are they whole lips? 
[03:45:00]  No they're big  These things are  I mean there's  There's several pounds of meat  On a cow's lip  So when you're driving  And it's at night  And you're a little lonely  Do you pull a set out  Spit into them  And just jack off with them?  Are they all frowning?  They're frozen  I'd have to calm down  I'd have to  Because they were having  Their face cut off  All right you just can't give more lip facts  On the tempting humor  On the show  Go right ahead  There's not one smiling set of cow lips  Because he was having his face cut off 
[03:45:30]  They're all just  I'm sad  Sad sacks  My face is being cut off  Bunch of frowners  As they flash  Freeze the lips  And that frown  Is it true  Bird victims use  Cow lips  So they can  Smile  Okay  I wish I had my pee puff  You can make your own joke

[03:46:30]  An animal that we shouldn't kill  Any animal that has like  No hindquarter hair  That shits  Because there's nothing  For the fucking shit  To cake to  If there's a smooth assed animal  And it shits smoothly  And there's no hindquarter legs  And hair  I'm sorry  No hindquarter hair  Then it should be allowed to live  Even if it doesn't wipe?  No  Because it probably doesn't  It can't wipe  Oh you're being reasonable now  Maybe  I don't know  It has no fucking  It's got hooves  Or some fucking creepy things  That are good for  Scaling trees 
[03:47:00]  Any animal that rubs  Its ass on bark  As an attempt to wipe  Because it's seen people  I think bears do that  Alright then bears can live  I've seen bears  But bears have so much hair back there  All they wind up doing  Is smearing it all over their ass  They don't know any better  They're just  They're just  They're just trying to be like people  Just trying to record some production  That's why they wander  Into our neighborhoods  They're trying to assimilate  We keep shooting them  Making rugs out of them  They don't know any better  They think when they see  When they see a lodge  With a bear laying in front of a fireplace  And people fucking on it  They think he's part of the team 
[03:47:30]  Do you think the bears  Is  Yeah  Now see  Pot talk continues  You think  You think the bears  Are coming into our neighborhoods  Because  They could be the first bear  That gets along with us  Yeah  I mean the first animal  They think it's going to be like  We're going to share everything with them  Right  They want to be a part of  Yeah  Part of the human race  They want to drive cars  They're ready  And they're like  Look man  We're done with the woods and stuff  Yeah  We want to drive cars  We want to get a job  I want to have kids 
[03:48:00]  We want to wait at bus stops  We want to do everything you're doing  They don't understand taxidermy  They see a bear mounted with his arms  And they think we worship them  And his face back to strolling like gods  And we just shoot him in the head  We fucking shoot  Tranquilizing darts into them  And then fucking haul them back  Drag them back into their shitty lives  Shit takes for a beat  It's stupid  But their little cubs are sitting there going  But daddy  I thought you had this figured out for us  Exactly  Beat it you three legged trap victim  Fuck yourself  Fucking cunt of a bear 
[03:48:30]  Buzz off  Buzz off  Before I wear one of your shitty claws  And necklace  A little memento  Toward dominance  A little memento  Yeah beat it honey eater  Of my weekend in the woods  Yeah  Alright  Well  It's been a great day  A fun filled show  A little odd doing it from these studios  They don't understand  They think they're like the fucking bears 
[03:49:00]  That like ride bikes and dance  They think the bears that dance have made it  They think that they're respected stars in show business  Did you hear about Barry?  He went over to Romania  He's a big dancing star  They have no idea there's a fucking  A rusty hook through Barry's nose  Being led in a circle by fucking gypsies  Barry stinks 
[03:49:30]  Barry's fucking awful  One false move  He's getting a cattle prod up his ass  Of course he is  Poor Barry  He fucking has to walk on his hind legs  And pretend he's dancing  But they don't have the internet yet  So the story is passed down  They have no idea  So by the time the story gets back to the woods  You know Barry's a star  Rusty  Rusty a hook in his nose  Is they fucking like yank on it  If Barry doesn't do the fucking  The Watusi properly  They think Barry's a big dance star 
[03:50:00]  He's a star of stage and screen  His nose is always running from the hook  Trying to figure out how they could be like Barry  The imperfections  They're practicing their dance moves  But they don't know what they're doing  That's what they're doing  When they rub their shitty asses on the bark tree  They think they're dancing  They're going cha-cha-cha  Cha-cha-cha  Why can't you be more like your cousin Barry 
[03:50:30]  He's a big star  He's a big star in Romania  Make me laugh  So Pod Talk Monday  Have Travis write that down  It's worked well  We'll do another one next Monday  Thank you for coming in sweetheart  The bicycling bear's feet are nailed to the pedals  Of course they are  If the fucking bike tips over  He can't jump off  He just has to lay there  He's like an asshole  While they help pull on that rusty ring 
[03:51:00]  To get the bike up  And they never take him off the bike  He has to sleep that way  He has to shit that way  No  Nobody wants to help him up either  Because he's clawing and screaming  Let him tire himself out like that  Then fucking when he falls asleep  We'll prop him back up  Like we're just trying to help you up  You fucking idiot  Alright leave him there  Write his family  Tell him Barry's a big star  Fucking bears are idiots  They really are 
[03:51:30]  Thank God they have comfy fur  Fucking stupid rugs  First you were a shit machine  Now you're a rug  Why did God make you?  They're good for two things  Shitting and fucking on  And taxidermy  I want to buy a big stuffed bear  Just to burn it  And kick it over  It just lives for nothing 
[03:52:00]  It's not even beautiful in death  Just fucking tip it over  Burning like Saddam's statue  And laugh at it  What do you think of that shit machine?  Your life has been for naught  It's for nothing  You ate a few berries  And then you got shot  Fuck yourself  Stuffed  And burned  And pushed over  Exactly  And the taxidermers  Had to comb your hair 
[03:52:30]  Over the fucking trap marks  On your fat little bear leg  Stupid  What do you think?  Somebody just left a big snack  In the middle of a steel circle  With teeth on it  You asked for  What could that have been?  I'd love to ask a bear  What did you think that was?  It was a metal circle  With spikes coming out of it  How could that have worked out?  Oh fuck  Holy shit  Do you think someone just left 
[03:53:00]  A big pile of honey and berries  In the middle of the woods  For no reason?  Fucking moron  You know how stupid  A bear must feel  Where a trap closes on its leg  He's probably like  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  They did tell me about this shit  I remember now  I heard about this  Oh yeah  Normally when I get berries  They're not in a bushel  With honey sprinkled on them  I have to rip them off trees 
[03:53:30]  Normally there's bees thing  Right  We'll attempt to end the show again  Oh shit  Reading from Wackbag  Could we hammer a nail through Julie's feet  And make her ride a unicycle?  Oh poor Julie  We're gonna get you tickets for Detroit  Yeah  You were fun Julie  Thank you  Thank you  Jimmy's made everyone hate bears 
[03:54:00]  How can you not hate them?  Fucking cunt of an animal it is  Does nothing  Terrorize people  Fuck with your tents  For every tent that gets ripped up  What kind of animal should you have to hang your own fucking garbage food  40 feet away from your fucking sleeping quarters  Fucking flamethrowers  If he pops his head in the tent  You flamethrow him  I'm not burying my shit  Let him creep into the fucking 
[03:54:30]  Let him creep into the campgrounds  Give him a good flamethrowing  You know how fucking stupid a bear would look  If all of his fucking face and head fur was burned off  He'd smell real bad  It would be those little curly burnt hairs  All over  He'd have no eyebrows  You might get a bear with a fucking head like a burn victim  Even in the bear kingdom no one would fuck him  No bear pussy for you  Every time a bee stung on me he'd go  Ow  Couldn't even eat honey anymore  His fucking 
[03:55:00]  His tender burned bear skin  Little fluffy ears just look creepy  They look like Doritos  They're all burnt and just crispy  Just two pink veiny Doritos  That hurt to the touch  I'm going to be hacking up phlegm from laughing  Yeah  Yeah  Well  We have to head out I guess 
[03:55:30]  Moving day for hope  I got to see Alan Alda  Right  Someone is suggesting that we give Julie three tickets to the show  So she can bring a friend  That's Matt from Queensbury  He likes blueberries  Very good  I could breathe again  God damn
