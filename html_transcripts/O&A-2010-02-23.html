<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a lively discussion about their experience at the premiere of Kevin Smith's "Cop Out."  They initially pretended to dislike the film but quickly reversed course, praising the direction, action, and performances of Tracy Morgan and Sean William Scott (expected as a guest the following day). Jim Norton, also in the film, humorously bragged about his role.  The premiere itself was a significant topic, with anecdotes about encounters with celebrities like Bruce Willis, Kelly Ripa, Rick Fox, Kevin Pollack (with whom Anthony had an awkward interaction), and  Anthony's humorous account of a long Louis C.K. filming session that delayed his arrival.  Anthony also shared a colorful description of an overheard conversation at the premiere, and described filming a scene with Michelle Trachtenberg.

The conversation shifted to Jim Norton's appearance on Sean Hannity's show.  They recounted a heated debate on healthcare that was derailed by Norton's joke about Valtrex.  They further discussed a segment featuring Gloria Allred, where Norton's and Janine Pirro's contributions overshadowed Allred, focusing on Allred's perceived exploitation of Tiger Woods' mistresses.

The show then moved to unrelated topics.  The hosts discussed political strategist Bob Beckel finding their humor amusing. They heavily criticized NBC's Olympic coverage, specifically their decision to prioritize ice dancing over hockey, citing higher ratings for the former and debating the appropriateness of this choice.  They also discussed outrage from Aboriginal people over a Russian ice dancing performance's costumes.  A significant portion of the show involved graphic and highly offensive commentary about the movie *Precious*, its plot, characters, and the main actressâ€™s weight and appearance; the hosts debated whether her performance was acting or a reflection of her personality. A listener called in with a theory about *Lost*, suggesting a possible reference to Opie and Anthony's real names in the show, which they dismissed as Photoshopped.  Another caller mentioned a Danish curler who cried due to heckling, leading to a discussion about curling, a potential curling video game, and a possible field trip to a curling rink.

The broadcast concluded with a tense argument between Opie and staff member Steve Carlisi regarding communication issues.  The argument escalated from a comment about Opie being difficult to communicate with into accusations and mutual recriminations.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We still love doing radio, by the way.  Love it!  You heard it here, folks.  What I like about our show, it's fun and safe at the same time.  We're popular! 
[00:00:30]  See, we rule on the radio.  We have a good 40 minutes, an average 120, an hour of filler, and an hour of dread.  What the fuck is going on?  Stereohector.  And you, I don't go to your job at the Gold Addict that you work with.  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be starstruck.  Who gives a shit?  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  Well, a lot of people lose today.  You know they were taking bets out there, Ann, if we were going to make it in today?  Bets?  Had a big movie premiere last night that we were invited to.  Go screw.  And everyone's like, oh man, they're going to use that as an excuse to take a day off.  Stop it.  Stop it.  No.  No.  We've got to do the right thing and talk about Kevin Smith's new movie, Cop Out.  Wow.  Holy shit.  What a piece of garbage. 
[00:01:30]  Teasing, of course.  Can you imagine?  I know.  After the big invited.  Oh.  I always think that.  That's why I don't want to be invited to things.  If it sucks, you've got to, like, fake it.  Yeah, if you've been following the Kevin Smith-Cop Out thing, at first, Ed and I weren't sure  if we were going to be invited to the premiere, and usually we just shut our mouths, but the  movie looked good, Jim Norton's in it, and we know all the players, and we're like, you  know, we kind of want to see, eh, we want to go.  Want to go.  So we pushed a little bit on this one. 
[00:02:00]  Can you imagine if the movie sucked?  What position we would be in right now?  You'd sit there going, like, well, you know, it had these moments that were really, oh,  God.  Okay, we've got to lie.  No lying.  New York looked really good in the film.  That was filmed wonderfully.  I will start by saying, yes, as far as Kevin Smith's directing goes, his best directed movie  he's ever done.  Wow, really?  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, it looks really good.  And it's very well directed.  There's a million, like, edits?  Yeah, yeah.  In a good way.  He edited the whole thing, too.  He did, right?  Yeah.  I mean, it goes shot to shot to shot to shot to shot.  And he's got good camera moves and kind of this, like, almost artsy look to some of the  scenes where there's a little bit of slow motion and stuff.  Yeah.  Like, Kevin's fucking trying some shit out.  Well, I mean, the movie itself was really good. 
[00:03:00]  Was really fucking good.  Funny.  I don't know why we're teasing it.  I mean, this cop-out is going to, I think it's going to do well.  I think so, too.  I think people are going to enjoy the hell out of it.  Tracy Morgan is just beyond hilarious in this movie.  Freaking Bruce Willis plays more of a straight man but gets some funny lines in and just controls  all the action because that's what Bruce Willis does.  You know what it completely reminded me of is when I first saw 48 Hours.  Yeah.  Like, when I first sat down and watched 48 Hours in the fucking theater, it was just like 
[00:03:30]  one of those.  The gruff guy, kind of straight guy.  The funny black guy.  Mm-hmm.  And the couple of other cops in the precinct that are constantly treating the two other  guys like assholes.  The fucking captain.  That is the scumbag.  It's like got all of those things.  It's an homage to those like 80s buddy cop movies but done so well and so up to date.  Right.  That it just fucking works. 
[00:04:00]  The music is good in it.  Mm-hmm.  Perfect for the mood of the movie.  The gangsters are great.  Yeah.  The gangsters are really good.  They're like the typical bad fucking gangster guys from those movies.  And they made it work because it's so fucking funny.  Like, every scene is a laugh.  And there's a lot of action in the movie and a lot of violence.  And the violence is really good.  Yep.  Because a lot of times when you see a comedy with violence, they kind of cop out. 
[00:04:30]  They gloss over it.  They kind of cop out on the violence.  Oh, you.  But not in this movie, man.  Well, I don't want to give any spoilers away.  Nah, no spoilers.  But I mean, the violence was right on too.  So you get the violence.  You get the comedy.  You get Sean William Scott.  Sean William Scott was hysterical.  I think he's coming in tomorrow.  He was really fucking funny in that.  Yeah.  And Bruce Willis, like you said, like a straight guy, but total action guy.  You know, so when there's that action, gunfire sequences and shit, he's right there with that. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  And Tracy, just out of his mind, fucking funny.  Yeah.  I don't even know if he was acting.  It was good.  And Jimmy Norton, let me tell you.  I did see Jimmy Norton.  Also called the linchpin of the film.  Yes.  Yes.  The whole movie hinges on Jimmy.  Your longest scene yet in movies.  Yeah, I heard I was on screen for a few seconds, and then they used my voice to bleed into the...  I'm glad I made it into the film. 
[00:05:30]  Ah, you were more than a few seconds, I think.  My face, I mean.  Like, I heard my voice was on.  Yeah, no.  Well, if it wasn't for you, the story couldn't advance.  Well, they did...  They needed to talk to you.  If it wasn't for me, the movie would have ended in Brooklyn.  They would have went, nowhere to go from here.  Yeah, exactly.  And it would have been a 40-minute film.  Do you understand Bruce and Tracy didn't know what to do until I gave them the info?  Yeah, imagine you refused to do your scene.  I'm just not going to do it.  But we can't film anything else.  Or I give them the wrong info and send them somewhere else. 
[00:06:00]  Somewhere else.  We don't have...  We can't film there.  Oh, cold case.  Yeah.  It's done.  You need to go to Antarctica.  Cut.  That's not what we need from you, sir.  Well, there's a lot of shock already, Ant.  So why don't we start with Coke Logic?  Because there was something in the first few minutes that he picked up on.  Oh, okay.  Coke Logic.  Hello.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  What?  Oh, we stepped over each other.  Yeah.  And went to a theater. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, a theater.  Is this the first movie theater you've been to?  Oh, and since the last premiere.  Which was what?  I think the last Kevin Smith movie.  Which was...  Zack and Mary?  Oh, wait.  I didn't go to that one.  Maybe the one before that.  Get the fuck...  Wait, wait, wait.  What was the Kevin Smith movie before Zack and Mary?  Wait, you haven't been to a movie theater in well over a year?  Oh, hell yeah.  Wow.  It's been over a year. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Was it actually in the theater, or did you set up a private room in the back with a TV  and a bootleg copy?  Nope, nope.  It was in the very huge screening theater.  Giant.  Yeah.  And you know why?  Because it was full of the likes of me.  Celebrities.  That's why.  It was just fancy, hoity-toity people.  No riff-raff, although since it was a movie with, Jesus Christ, Mental Block, hi. 
[00:07:30]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Tracy Morgan.  Holy shit.  Since it was a Tracy Morgan movie, there were a few brothers in there.  There were a lot of brothers.  A few of the brothers, you know, representing.  There were some scary people in there.  And I learned, I think Kevin, not Kevin, I think Kenny told me, actually, what they do  is they have a line outside the theater where people line up, and those people get to go 
[00:08:00]  in.  They figure out how many tickets are left over of people that didn't come to the premiere.  Yeah.  And then they let the standby line in.  Oh, standby.  And those are basically movie-loving animals.  That's just riff-raff.  Movie-loving lunatics.  Well, it's different than just going to a movie.  You know, it's all the celebrities, and then Kevin Smith gets up front before the movie starts,  and he talked for about 20 minutes or so, and gave thank yous to a bunch of people, 
[00:08:30]  and, you know, threw a few funny jokes in about him getting kicked off the airplane.  Shit like that.  And, yeah, it was good.  It was pretty good.  Yeah, he was peppering.  Some of that into his speech.  Yeah.  And then, you know, when the movie starts, people are just, they're not going to be rude.  It's not like you're going to sit there and have somebody gapping on their phone or fucking  around. 
[00:09:00]  You can't.  There's, like, security walking around the place.  So that's the way every movie should be, but isn't.  So that's why I don't go to the movies.  Well, their security wasn't that good, because I got this whole cop-out movie on my HD flip,  man.  Oh, did you?  Oh, my God.  Looks good.  It looks amazing.  Yeah?  High def?  High def.  I brought my high def flip in there, and I'm going downtown with this copy, if you know  what I mean.  You got the applause when Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan, her guy, come on the screen for the  first time. 
[00:09:30]  It's kind of weird to see people applaud at a movie.  Well.  Because the people they're applauding are there.  They're right there in the theater.  Yeah.  That's what's weird about going to a premiere, too, because you don't know if people are,  like, pumping up their laughs because the people that they're watching are sitting in  the theater.  Look, I'm laughing at your part.  Yeah, exactly.  But it really wasn't.  And every time an actor came on screen for the first time, his little pocket of friends  and family, they had an applause. 
[00:10:00]  So the applause was coming from all over the theater.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  All of a sudden, it's just the New York City vendor guy, and he has a couple of his family  members in theater, so now they have to clap for him, even though he doesn't even have  a speaking role.  But damn, this movie's going to do very, very, very well.  It really will.  It's really good.  Really funny.  We have the worst luck, me and my wife there.  We're sitting right behind the 30 Rock people. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  You don't really watch 30 Rock?  No.  But Kenneth and the rest of them were right there.  The only one that, Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin were the only ones, but everyone else was  pretty much right in front of me.  And Tracy Morgan has two of his friends that are in 30 Rock that are, honestly, they're  probably almost seven foot tall.  Oh, shit.  Two seven foot tall black guys sat right in front of me and my girl.  Oh, so you really kind of missed the bottom half of the movie? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, because there was only just a few subtitles.  Yeah.  You know, and I needed to actually get out of my seat to look over their heads to read  the subtitles.  You got to be more assertive, man.  Like, just take your hand in the back of the head and go, move.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then throw some N-bombs in it, too, if that helps.  Wait, Alec Baldwin was there with...  No, no, no.  Oh, they weren't there.  Well, maybe they were.  I didn't see them.  Kelly Ripa was sitting right behind me. 
[00:11:30]  Who else did we see?  Yeah, we saw her.  Rick Fox.  At the party.  Yes, I saw Rick Fox.  The ex-Los Angeles Laker.  And he used to, I think, bang Vanessa Williams.  I think they were married, right?  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah.  Who else was there?  Oh, my God.  Kevin Pollack.  Kevin Pollack.  Kevin Pollack.  Motherfucker.  Anthony and Kevin Pollack had a moment.  I just...  I swear to God.  Look, I like Kevin Pollack in movies. 
[00:12:00]  I think in Usual Suspects, he was very good in that.  Yeah.  You know, and he's a comic.  Casino.  He has impressions.  Casino, he was in that.  But, I mean, you know, I go up to, you know, shake his hand.  We're all of, you know, similar ilk, as Jim likes to say.  Yeah, right.  And I got what I call the 90-degree handshake.  It's where his arm goes out 90 degrees from his body. 
[00:12:30]  He is looking 90 degrees forward from his arm and shakes my hand without even turning his head.  He gave me the Dennis Leary.  Oh, the famous Dennis Leary.  Remember the Dennis Leary at the bar in Boston?  I remember.  Kevin Pollack, the new Dennis Leary with me.  How did it go, though?  It was like he was hanging out there.  I was hanging out in the same area.  Nothing was going on.  So I was like, Kevin, great job. 
[00:13:00]  You know, great job with the movie.  It's really funny.  Thank you.  And his hand came out.  He couldn't be bothered to turn his body and even look at who acknowledged his work and who he was shaking hands with.  You could have been, I don't know, the fucking executive producer.  It didn't matter to him who the fuck I was.  He doesn't know whose hand he shook.  I could have been, yeah.  I could have been the head of Warner Brothers or the fucking popcorn vendor. 
[00:13:30]  And anyone in between.  And he just could give a shit.  You know, I think that's going to bite him on the ass.  I really do.  Well, I hope so.  You do get the last laugh because we've said no to Kevin Pollack many, many times.  And maybe he recognized that, the fact that we say no whenever he asks to be on this very program to plug his comic gigs.  He was on once, and quite frankly, there was no chemistry between us and Mr. Pollack. 
[00:14:00]  And I know he's a very talented guy.  Well, you know something?  He does these impressions, and you'd think they were the real people.  Who does he do?  He does a great Shatner.  He does a great Columbo.  Peter Falk.  Those are like his trademark.  He does a lot.  He does a lot of impressions.  I do them.  He does good impressions.  You do them?  We know that.  It's already covered on this show.  Do a Shatner.  Let me see.  The Shatner, the men, is... 
[00:14:30]  Wait.  Bones.  The Shatner, the men, is...  Wait.  Bones.  All right.  Spock, I have to go.  Oh, wow.  Spock, my force field fell.  Perfect.  Yeah, so he completely blew me off.  But I didn't care because the highlight of my night, not meeting Bruce Willis at the bar. 
[00:15:00]  You met Bruce Willis.  Right at the bar.  Me and Bruce Willis.  Hanging.  Why not?  What did you guys talk about?  Oh, my God.  What didn't we talk about is...  I could cover that quicker.  What didn't we talk about?  Me and Bruce Willis.  How much FaceTime did you get with Bruce Willis?  I mean, because he's the big star of the movie.  You know something?  When you're in that surreal kind of attitude...  Everybody wanted to talk to him last night. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Or a conversation with somebody.  You really time...  What is it?  Sometimes an hour seems like 10 seconds.  Sometimes 10 seconds seems like an hour.  To Bruce, I'm sure it did.  Jesus.  Look, it's fantastic.  That's all I need.  But it wasn't even Bruce Willis.  So you reached too high, my friend.  No, I don't.  Because I talked to the...  I'm a go-getter.  I talked to the lesser knowns.  I talked to the ones that's on the way up. 
[00:16:00]  You know Poe Boy's little brother in the film?  Yeah.  He's a stand-up comic.  Yeah.  I forgot his name already.  I talked to him for a few minutes.  I talked with, of course, people calling him Stifler.  I love when people just go, hey, Stifler.  Hey, Stifler.  Sean William Scott.  Sean William Scott.  He, A, recognized us.  He's very cool.  And B, was excited to talk to us. 
[00:16:30]  Came up to us and was talking.  He's a very good guy, it seems.  He seems like a really good guy.  And funny as fuck in this movie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But all those people...  He steals a lot of scenes.  All those people meant nothing to me.  Really?  Yes.  Michelle Trachtenberg.  The beautiful Michelle Trachtenberg.  I love that little Jew.  I don't...  She was Buffy's little sister on the series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer. 
[00:17:00]  I never saw Buffy.  She was Harriet the Spy in Harriet the Spy many, many years ago.  See, that's her right there.  Oh, she's Bruce Willis' daughter in the film.  In the movie, yes.  Oh, okay, I know her.  I just didn't know her by name.  Oh.  I saw her in the film last night.  Yeah.  You saw her live?  When we started just fucking making out, I was beside myself.  I'm like, I can't believe I'm doing this.  She's a little potty mouth. 
[00:17:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Some of this stuff coming out of her mouth.  Talking about ass sex.  What are you talking about?  I swear, no one's going to believe you.  I don't care if anyone believes me.  I was there, and I fucking heard it, and it was great.  Wait, you heard it because you were eavesdropping?  Why would I eavesdrop on her?  What am I going to do, like a fucking creep just skulk around?  So you talked to her?  Her.  Of course I did.  You made out with her?  It was fantastic.  You made out with her?  I might not have made out with her. 
[00:18:00]  But you talked about it.  I was close enough to make out with her.  Wait a minute.  You talked to ass sex with her?  Well, I heard her say it.  To who?  I don't know.  She's so hot.  Look at her big blue eyes.  Yeah, she's pretty ridiculous.  Did you really talk to her?  Briefly.  But I look at it as breaking the guy, Soapy.  Do you?  So the next time, I have a common, like, hey.  Why do you set yourself up to be disappointed? 
[00:18:30]  I don't know, because I like people.  Like, I know Tracy Morgan pretty well over the years.  I just kind of nodded to him, said, hey, man.  And he goes, hey.  And that was it.  I knew that's it.  And that was it.  I saw Tracy right when he got out of the limo.  Right.  I was like, Tracy.  He's like, hey, motherfucker.  What you up to?  In his red jumpsuit?  I'm here to see your movie.  He's doing the run DMC look.  Yeah.  Do I aim too high?  Is that it?  Look.  Look at it.  I don't think I aim too high.  I think.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:19:00]  You seem like you were getting along well when you said, hi, I'm Anthony.  Can I have a picture?  And I took a picture of them two.  Yes.  I got to get that one.  I'll see about that.  Let's see.  Oh, that's a very good question.  Dave in Easton.  Dave.  Dave.  How you doing?  Good morning, Dave.  Good boy.  Hey.  Hey, Anthony.  I was wondering, maybe did you take your, oh, my God, trainer with you? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Did you bring the male trainer?  People want to know.  Why would I bring a trainer to the, oh, punch that one up.  Why would I bring a trainer to the premiere?  That's silly.  Yeah, I know.  I was dateless.  We heard you, Dave.  I was the lonely guy.  Wow, look at that picture of her, Ant, huh?  Oh.  What would you do with that spot on her?  I would touch her boobies.  But what would you do with the spot in between the boobies?  In the middle?  Yes, yes.  That's where my jism would go. 
[00:20:00]  I'd smell restraining order.  Ah, well.  So I guess, uh.  Look at the picture.  I like the one upper right.  No, over now.  She's eight.  Oh, look.  That was many years ago.  Look at the puffy lips, huh?  Yeah, those didn't go away.  She got some nice puffy lips.  So, uh, this movie should do very well for Kevin Smith, Bruce Willis, Tracy Morgan, Jim 
[00:20:30]  Norton, Sean William Scott.  Yup.  And a bunch of, uh, very talented actors.  A bunch of Hispanic people.  Yeah, I don't know the names.  That played great evil criminals.  Fucking po' boy.  Po' boy was, uh, very, very good in the movie.  Adrian Brody was in the movie, too.  I don't know if he was at the...  I didn't see him at the...  Adrian Brody was in the movie?  Yes.  Did you see Adrian Brody?  I did not see him.  He was Kevin Pollack's partner.  That was Adrian Brody?  That was Adrian Brody.  No fucking way.  What? 
[00:21:00]  Who's Adrian Brody, then?  Adrian Brody.  He was, uh, he won an Oscar.  Hold the phone.  Wait, now I'm really confused.  That could not have been him.  Did he get a nose job?  No, that's not him.  That's Adrian Brody.  Yeah.  What does he play?  He's the guy with the boots.  Kevin Pollack's partner?  That's what I said.  That can't be him.  That's Adrian Brody.  Did he get a nose job?  I don't know.  That can't be him.  That's him.  Because it did not even resemble him.  No, no, no.  His nose...  Hold on a minute. 
[00:21:30]  I gotta say no.  I would bet a lot of money that wasn't Adrian Brody.  I bet you a kiss.  It's impossible.  What are they saying he played in Cop Out?  Did they take him out of the movie and replace him?  And put another guy in?  Because I was looking at that guy going...  No.  That's funny.  Very good.  But where's...  Adam Brody.  Adam Brody.  Adam Brody.  Okay.  Thank you.  Oh, my God. 
[00:22:00]  That was freaking me out.  I'm like, wait...  The guy had like a smaller nose.  Yeah, that guy was in the movie.  His name's Adam Brody.  Didn't look like him at all.  Adam Brody's a little different than Adrian Brody.  Yeah, that was...  Okay.  Yeah, my mistake.  That was...  Oh, my God.  That's what I'm saying.  My mistake.  Well, I haven't...  Yeah.  I did see it.  You see the scene with Johnny Norton?  I was too busy looking at Ted Willis.  Did you know I was dead for the entire film? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, my mistake.  Okay, no problem.  No problem.  Well, I haven't seen the final cut.  I was unable to go yesterday because of our work.  Ant said it.  It was...  I mean, I know he's a friend of ours, but it was well-directed.  I mean, wow.  I want to see what the music and all that shot really nicely.  I mean, Ant said it all.  I like the...  We don't have to repeat it all.  Those sweeping helicopter location shots where you're just kind of like...  It kind of resets where you are in New York City and stuff like that. 
[00:23:00]  And obviously, they use one of those helicopters with the stabilization camera.  And you just get these really wide, sweeping views of New York.  He just did a really good fucking job with that, man.  Yeah.  I think Kevin will be coming in in the next day or two, hopefully.  Sean William Scott, I believe, is going to be in tomorrow.  And Tracy, you never know with him these days.  Yeah.  Maybe Tracy stops by and says hi to us.  It's been a while.  Yeah.  He really was fucking good.  Yeah.  Tracy Morgan. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, I thought he was great.  I just want to see the final piece.  You really should.  Well, what happened to you yesterday?  Yeah, what were you up to?  I didn't know until...  You had a real busy day yesterday.  I didn't know until Friday that I was...  I was hanging with your girl last night.  Yeah, she was...  I was possibly going to meet her there.  I didn't know if I was going to be able to.  Yeah, I had two dates last night.  I had mine and Jimmy's.  I had...  We were all just hanging out together.  Then I stole her for a while just to walk out with Kenny so we could go to the party. 
[00:24:00]  And I just walked around with her so people would think I was with her.  That's what I do.  No, you were filming Louis C.K.'s show yesterday.  I was doing a scene for Louis and we thought we were going to be done by lunch.  It was going so well.  But then Louis gets in like single coverage.  It was really...  It went very well.  But it was just a lot of...  A long day.  Yeah.  And we didn't finish until around 7 p.m.  It was almost 12 o'clock a day.  Is it a good scene?  Wow.  Yeah, I think it's very funny. 
[00:24:30]  Is it...  Can we say what...  I can't.  I can't see any content.  Kenny told me on the way home and I just stopped myself.  Okay.  I could just say that Louis is amazing to work...  Because I was watching the way he was using the camera for sweeping scenes.  Yeah.  And I'm like, this is why he's so brilliant at what he does.  Because he's directing it as well.  All I would do is just take a bunch of singles and try to piece them together.  Turn the camera on.  Okay, your turn to talk.  Your turn to talk.  Do all of your lines and all.  But Louis really is amazing.  Locked together.  If you've never seen him in that...  Because I know him as a comedian. 
[00:25:00]  Obviously, I worked with him as a lucky Louis.  But to see him as a director as well.  When you see how competent he is.  Like, he's really fucking good at what he does.  And you have complete faith in him while you're working.  Wow.  He's a funny guy, man.  He's a talented guy.  He really is brilliant.  It's annoying.  It's fucking great.  Annoying.  Very, very cool.  And then you had a scene in Cop Out.  And then you also went and did Hannity last time.  That was why...  I heard Hannity was good.  Yeah, it went good.  But that's why I didn't run right over to the thing.  Because I literally came back...  And I would have been late. 
[00:25:30]  I would have missed the opening of the movie anyway.  The beginning.  And I had to do Hannity.  So I had to prepare stuff and go over the lines.  And then right when I got in my room, I turned on the TV.  And what's on?  Hannity.  Oh, is it on?  And it was before you even came on.  So I was able to see your entire appearance on Hannity last night.  You fucking killed.  Thanks, man.  That one guy there.  The fucking...  Oh, Bob Beckley.  Yeah.  Bob.  He was laughing his fucking ass up.  And then you threw that woman.  She couldn't get her thought out. 
[00:26:00]  You fucked her up so bad.  I didn't say anything bad.  Wait, set it up.  Because I'm lost.  Because I didn't get to see it yet.  On Sean's show, you do two segments.  They both go out live.  It's kind of like a panel thing, right?  Yeah.  And it was like a free-for-all.  Because Gloria Allred had been interviewed with Sean one-on-one.  Oof.  And, you know, she's awful.  You know who she is?  The lawyer.  She's got Tiger's Girls.  Yeah, we played the audio yesterday.  Sean ripped her a fucking ass.  She had nothing to stand on. 
[00:26:30]  So as Sean comes over, he's like, how are the boys?  You're the first guys he asked for.  And I would chit-chatting.  I'm like, oh, she's awful.  He's like, eh, you know.  He's not going to be bad-mouthed.  Yeah, he makes good television.  But somebody's like, do you want to talk about Tiger when we come back?  Which we didn't plan on doing.  So we kind of were free-willing just to talk about Tiger.  So it was kind of, I think all of us felt a little out of sync because the topic was a little off.  So, which is fine for me to talk about Tiger a lot.  Yeah, yeah.  And Bob Beckel didn't care. 
[00:27:00]  He talked about anything.  Threw a couple of shockers in there.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  God damn it.  And then I did some joke.  You know, let's just say, you know, come on.  You know, I mean, it was a Valtrex herpes joke.  And he gets really nervous when you go down that road.  But he even said afterwards, Beckel said, wow, that was as close as you can come to the line without going over.  And Sean's like, he never goes over the line.  Like, I'm not going to get in trouble.  And Sean just sits there going, oh, my.  Oh, good gosh.  Oh, good gravy.  But you know he secretly loves that stuff. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, of course.  He'll never admit that.  But he secretly loves all that crap.  As long as, look, I figure, I wouldn't say really anything on that show you couldn't see on NBC.  So I'm like, I'm not going to get in trouble.  Yeah, yeah.  But after the herpes thing, she literally was stopped.  But it wasn't directed at her?  No, no, no.  She just could not get her thought.  She was trying to say something and could not even remember what she was going to talk about.  Because she was so thrown by the herpes joke.  I don't know why.  Because it wasn't even that brutal a joke.  Maybe it hit close to home. 
[00:28:00]  I almost said that to her, but it would have been a goof.  But I didn't say it.  She'd have fallen off her fucking chair.  I almost said that, but I'm like, you know what?  I know I'm kidding as a cop, but I didn't want to fuck, you know.  I was kidding.  Because she literally was like, oh, that one threw me.  Give her a Valtrex.  She'll love me in the morning.  You know, Manny, I kind of care with her.  There's so many open wounds.  But she was very nice.  She enjoyed herself, but I really didn't mean to throw her.  That was funny, though.  But it wasn't even like I was fucking with her.  I really wasn't. 
[00:28:30]  No, no.  She just, the content.  Anyone could have said that, and she would have been thrown.  Very funny.  Well, now we've got to hear it.  If Sam could get it down the hall, that would be great.  Jimmy, that was a very enjoyable.  Cool.  Enjoyable.  Gloria Allred.  Oh, when Hannity was going after her, and she's just trying to.  Wait, she was on again last night?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, because we played the audio of her and Janine Pirro.  I heard about that.  Yeah, this was just Janine Pirro and Hannity.  I kicked her ass.  And she's, again, just trying to defend this whore that is her client, and saying that she 
[00:29:00]  demands that Tiger apologize to this porn star.  And if you logically just think about this, he's trying to patch up sponsorships, his  marriage, his career, his personality, the hero worship, the fucking kids looking up  to him, and he's supposed to then go face to face with a porn star that he fucked out 
[00:29:30]  of his marriage, and apologize to her for what?  So we're at a point where mistresses have rights now, too?  That's what Gloria Allred thinks.  That is such bullshit.  Like, the mistress understands exactly what she's doing.  It's a married man.  Yeah.  Cheating on his wife, and now what?  Once it falls apart, I'll bet her off.  And now the mistress is mad because she wasn't the only mistress.  She already knew her position, that she was cheating.  I mean, helping this guy cheat on his wife, but if there's now another mistress, now there's 
[00:30:00]  a problem?  Not if Gloria Allred had her way, because she thinks that this porn star was, she fell in  love with Tiger, and Tiger led her to believe that he was in love with her, and it was only  her, and the wife was going to be out of the picture, and they were going to run off together.  And then the thought of Tiger going, yeah, that's what I'll do. 
[00:30:30]  I'll dump the wife I've had no fucking problems with that is adored before the scandal, you  know?  Right.  I have kids with and everything.  It's wonderful.  I'm a hero.  I'm going to just throw that away, and then, you know, take a porn star to the masters so,  you know, she can meet the boys.  Oh, the boys wouldn't mind.  Who the fuck is thinking that's really going to happen?  But, Anthony, the boys wouldn't mind, it would be the boys' wives, the PGA officials,  She's hanging out with the fucking golfer's wives. 
[00:31:00]  Right, right.  Yeah.  She's there with the golfer's wives, you know, going, isn't this great?  Tiger left his wife for me.  What a delusional dope.  You want to tit fuck me?  Unbelievable, right?  She probably wouldn't leave.  I mean, anyone who's fucking a married guy, you know that he's just, you're just banging  him, and you're having a good time.  Of course.  So, what's up Gloria Allred's ass that she's fucking pushing this apology thing?  She's a reprehensible lawyer.  She's a fucking disgusting lawyer.  She wants FaceTime, that's all.  That's all it is.  She wants FaceTime, and she sees dollar signs, whether it's getting money out of Tiger for 
[00:31:30]  her client, or just, you know, future clients, because she's got, you know, more exposure.  More people now know who she is.  A lot of people already did, but.  Why do the mistresses care?  The bottom line is, you knew you were fucking a married guy.  Right.  All right, he fucked up.  He's patching up his marriage.  Right.  End of, end of, uh, involvement with you.  That's it.  But the mistresses are mad because they weren't the only mistress.  Like, there's, there's some kind of code as far as mistresses go? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Where it's, it's okay to be a mistress as long as you're the only mistress?  No, but it's the only way they can play victim at this time.  Right.  It's the only way they can say, look, yes, I wasn't behaving like a pig who should have  been treated like a pig.  It's the only way they can somehow paint themselves as victims.  Blue Heeler from Kentucky.  Side pussies have no rights by law.  Side pussy.  Exactly.  Side pussy have no rights by law.  Gloria Allred is just really fucking irritating. 
[00:32:30]  I'm not a scumbag lawyer.  I used to, I used to feel that way, Jimmy, but we played the audio yesterday of Janine Pirro  just beating the shit out of her.  She looks ridiculous.  Who's Janine Pirro?  Janine Pirro, I think she was a DA, uh, Westchester County.  Oh, she's a lawyer.  Okay.  I think she had some kind of problem with her marriage.  I forgot exactly what was going on, whether she was cheating or her husband was cheating.  Something went horribly wrong with her marriage, whatever.  Strong woman.  And now she does, uh, one of those lawyers, uh, uh, court, uh, uh, uh, uh, judge shows. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Yeah, there you go.  There's a picture.  I heard she demolished Allred.  She, yes, she did.  What?  I just said that four times.  Did you say demolished?  Killed her.  Yeah, no, no, no.  I, oh, you looked around.  Like, I know you said it.  Oh.  I mean, I had heard, I heard it before I came in here.  Like, it was, it was something I had heard before I got here.  Did you say the word demolished?  Destroyed.  Killed.  You said she beat the shit out of Gloria Allred.  Beat the shit.  Yeah.  And I'm kind of affirming that I had heard the same thing. 
[00:33:30]  Oh.  Even though I know you said it.  Oh, no.  You know what, Opie?  When you talk to you, it's like talking to a wall.  Steve C.  We'll get into that.  Steve Carlisi is not going to single me out for the fucking, uh, ridiculousness that's  happening with him and the staff here.  I'll tell you right the fuck now.  I'm done with fucking, uh, people that work for us singling me out.  Trust me.  Oh, ho, ho.  Game is the pleasure.  Trust me on this one.  I'll be keeping my eye on you.  This fucking guy isn't singling me out. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, well.  He lost his staff a year, year and a half ago.  He's not singling me out.  Trust me on that.  And I'm not putting up with any other bullshit from ex-employees.  It was fun when we walked in.  I'll tell you right the fuck now.  So much fun when we walked in today.  And, uh, it was a little, wow, little tit for tat going back and forth there with,  uh, Steve Carlisi.  I'm not, I'm not starting with Steve.  Trust me.  Apparently it was, uh, what started that whole thing?  Somebody said something was, somebody was like talking to a wall. 
[00:34:30]  Steve said, and then he said, uh, he said, yeah, it's sort of like talking to you.  Right, right, right, right.  Directing that toward Ope, you know, because, excuse me.  Ope had said something to Steve, asked, it was talking about a question, and Steve kind  of answered another question that wasn't really related.  Travis and E-Rock are out today.  So I was asking, I was asking why Travis and E-Rock are out or whatever.  Travis has a groin injury.  E-Rock has a neck injury.  Are you doing your homework?  I'll figure it out.  So I asked a question, and then he answered some other question that was in his head or 
[00:35:00]  something.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  He said, well, you know, trying to get an answer out of them is like trying to talk to  a wall.  Right.  And then he goes, much like it is talking to you.  Right.  Directing it to Ope, you know, it's like, excuse me.  I'll tell you.  Excuse me.  The one thing that everybody would be in agreement that is on the Ope and Anthony show, works for  the Ope and Anthony show.  I wear my fucking emotions on my face.  So it's never like talking to a wall. 
[00:35:30]  That's my problem.  That is my big fucking problem.  That's like talking to an open wound.  Exactly.  That's the one fucking, that is the complete opposite.  You always know what I'm feeling by looking at me.  Steve from Bishop saying, Steve's he answered with, why are fries so delicious?  No matter what the question is.  But Jimmy, getting back to your point.  No.  Uh oh.  Anthony and I went over the audio. 
[00:36:00]  Oh my God.  We went over the audio yesterday.  Yeah.  On our show where Gloria Allred beat the shit out of Janine Pirro.  So.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I had heard even before that she really fucking killed her.  Like, um, I didn't realize Pirro was a lawyer.  You're like, I knew the name, but I didn't know where I knew it from.  Right.  So, okay, that's my wife.  Because Gloria Allred is not stupid.  Like, what?  Nothing.  He just, he came.  I have nothing to say to you.  Oh, no.  He's coming back. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, no.  I thought there was going to be a problem.  I didn't say anything.  You're not going to single me out, Steve.  I didn't single you out.  Ex-employees have singled me out.  And trust me, they're in hell right now.  You didn't hear me right.  What you heard was what you wanted to hear.  Or, you might have misheard me.  What I said was, I responded to your comment, which was, oh, I'm going to go talk to a wall now.  Do you know how many times I've said that when I'm trying to talk to you and you immediately turn away and start talking to somebody else?  Because you try to talk to me during a radio show. 
[00:37:00]  No, dude, I'm talking about stuff that has nothing to do with the show at hand.  Dude, I'm talking about after the show.  I've tried to talk to you and you immediately turn around and start talking to somebody else.  And I just, like, look at the ceiling going, oh, my God.  Because I know.  Dude, that's exactly what I said.  I'm not fighting with you.  I wasn't fighting with you.  I wasn't picking a fight.  You're misinterpreting the whole thing.  I wasn't picking a fight.  Come on, dude.  I swear to God, I wasn't picking a fight.  I made a fucking smart-ass remark.  It struck a nerve.  And I apologize for striking a nerve. 
[00:37:30]  But I wasn't picking a fight with you.  It strikes a nerve because everyone feels like they talk to a wall when they're talking to you.  What did I not answer?  I don't have the answer.  You asked me why Travis was out.  Well, then you say that instead of answering something.  I don't even know what you answered.  You asked me why Travis was out.  I said he's taking a scheduled personal day.  You said, how come everybody else gets personal days?  The answer to that was, you do too.  That's not the answer you said. 
[00:38:00]  No, I know.  The answer I gave you was...  You answered some...  I don't know what you said.  Well, you know what?  Sam's coming down the hall.  It's like talking to a wall.  Hello, could you put it through the hole?  I've been thinking of a buddy-booth joke since the moment the wall got out.  All I've been thinking of is a hole.  It didn't take you so long.  Yes, hello.  I sensed that bear trap the second I walked in.  This one, please.  But listen, in all seriousness, I wasn't picking a fight with you. 
[00:38:30]  I wasn't.  That's the last thing I'm trying to do with anybody here.  And to insinuate that is wrong.  I wasn't trying to pick a fight with you.  I made a smart-ass joke.  I wasn't getting into it.  And I wasn't going to get into it.  So, you know, when I get pissed off, that's fine.  But I wasn't doing anything.  I'm showing you what talking to a wall really is.  I have no idea what you're saying.  It's just looking at the computer screen all the time.  What you're doing now is what I've been...  Yeah, okay.  This is what happens after the show sometimes when I'm trying to actually have legitimate conversations 
[00:39:00]  and you're not even acknowledging my existence.  That's frustrating.  It happens all the time.  With me, it's talking to the elevator doors.  That's talking to a drunk.  Talking to the floor.  But that's what I said.  Talking to the floor.  I answer all your questions, Steve.  So, whatever.  Dude.  I do answer all your questions.  In time.  In time?  Yeah, you do.  Really?  You know, look.  Hey, in all fairness, you are, out of everybody, you are the one that gets back to me the most. 
[00:39:30]  Out of everybody that I ask about guests and about bookings and things like that.  I'll get back to you about guests.  Can I get back to you with the important things?  You know?  Somebody says, ah, well, here's a guest or something.  I think I got back to...  I'll even look at my email for a second and see if I...  The last thing is that I got back to Steve Sion.  Let's see.  We'll go back.  It's Red Eye.  I'll be on Red Eye Thursday. 
[00:40:00]  Yes, you are.  I get a lot of junk mail.  There was a boxer I asked you about.  A lot of scrolling.  Well, there was already two out of three on the boxer, so I decided, what the fuck?  Was there two out of three on the boxer?  Yeah.  I think there was one.  So I get back to you the most, but it's like talking a wall with me.  Dude, I mean...  You can't get an answer from Anthony or anyone else faster than the answer I give you.  I was talking specifically about in-studio.  I'm just not going to be singled out this time. 
[00:40:30]  I'm not singling you out.  I'm not beating you up, and I'm not picking a fight with you.  You know, that ex-employee had major issues.  Dude, I'm fucking...  And I fucking was the one that was there for him, and he singled me out and fucking did  some shit that I'll never fucking forgive him for, and he's going to be in hell for that  for many years to come.  And all I did was try to help that fucking guy.  Are you putting me in the same category as that?  I'm just making sure it never fucking happens to me again.  Dude, I'm being very clear to you that I was not doing anything of that nature. 
[00:41:00]  I'm just making sure.  All right?  I speak my mind occasionally.  I put my fucking foot in my mouth more often than I'd like, but hey, I'm not picking  fights with you.  What, Anthony?  I'm just wondering how long it takes to get the burger buns out of your toenails.  The burger buns?  I don't...  Yes.  See?  He put his foot in his mouth.  Oh, dude.  See?  But it would hit the burger. 
[00:41:30]  That's...  Oh.  Maybe I didn't phrase it well enough.  Sorry.  No.  I'm still scrolling, trying to see when the last time I got back to Steve was.  All right.  Can I...  I think I'm in fucking October.  Yeah.  And that's the point I'm making by singling me out.  I'm not singling you out.  All right?  I can't even find the last time he communicated with you, Steve.  Do you understand what I'm saying now?  Ah, there it is.  All right.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  I understand what you're saying.  Do you think I'm...  Do you understand perfectly clear what I'm saying?  Yes, I do.  But do you understand... 
[00:42:00]  I'm not going to be anyone's fucking punching bag.  I'm not...  February 16th.  February 16th, Steve.  Is that like talking to a wall?  It was about Paul Mooney.  Do you feel like I was beating up on you?  No.  Okay.  But I'm making sure that I'm not singled out again.  I wasn't, okay.  Look, I made a smart-ass remark.  Emails are different.  Dude, I walk in here every day to a fray of incompetent, fat, gay, asshole gunfire.  I make one smart-ass remark, and your feelings got hurt. 
[00:42:30]  I apologize for hurting your feelings.  My feelings didn't get hurt.  You don't even get what I'm getting at.  I don't want to talk to you.  I want to do a radio show.  Okay, fine.  Okay?  My feelings didn't get hurt.  We want to do a radio show.  Fine.  Why'd you hurt his feelings, Steve?  All right?  I didn't try to.  It was an accident.  All right.  I'm going to go finish pulling that Jimmy audio.  That's what I got.  Thank you.  What's Sam doing? 
[00:43:00]  Sam's walking down the hall with him.  I just want to see Steve's fist go through the side of Sam's head and watch him fly through  a cabinet.  Well, at least I think I almost just saw it.  Look into the back of Sam's trousers.  You like how you had to end it with letting you know what he's up to?  Yeah.  I'll be over here doing this.  Huh?  What? 
[00:43:30]  Holy shit.  All I'm saying is there's issues with Steve and he's not going to fucking blame me in the  end like another asshole did.  That ain't fucking happening ever fucking again.  And that's the point I'm making today.  He lost his staff well over a year, year and a half ago.  He's not going to fucking take his frustrations out on me because he lost his guys a long  fucking time ago.  That's the headline here.  And he's feeling the frustration. 
[00:44:00]  So, you know, he took a little shot at me today.  I was one of the last guys to fucking, you know, be in his corner with this whole fucking  thing.  Trust me on that.  All right.  We're going to do a radio show.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  It's kind of miserable in New York.  It's going to rain for what? 
[00:44:30]  The next four days or something?  Yes.  Well, that fucking sucks.  Norton totally throws a guest off track on Hannity.  This was what we were talking about before the break.  One of the things we were talking about before the break.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's Kurt Cameron.  I used to know his wife there, Chelsea.  Who are you, Ian Halperin now?  Huh?  She went to Geneseo.  She went to Geneseo. 
[00:45:00]  She went to Geneseo.  I remember being her.  Chelsea was, she was a rock star at Geneseo.  Yeah.  She kind of had to leave school to start her acting.  Yeah.  She was in, she was on Cheers.  She was on Seinfeld.  She did a soap opera.  She, I bet they only have sex to procreate because of his, um.  Religion.  Born again-edness.  I think they have like seven kids or something.  He's like, she kept her body together considering she had, I think, how many kids did they have? 
[00:45:30]  Or have or whatever.  They have a lot of kids.  She was Nancy Mueller in Geneseo.  Then she went by Nancy Noble.  Then she went to Chelsea Noble.  Did she change her first name?  And now I think she's Chelsea Noble Cameron.  Yeah, it was tough.  Trying to give him a slip.  It was tough keeping up with her.  He, uh, he went completely like Born Again and then does these, does these movies where,  where, like, I guess, uh, there's an apocalypse or something. 
[00:46:00]  Some kind of rapture happens and.  Religious flicks.  Yeah.  Religious.  But they're religious action flicks.  Yeah, yeah.  Religious action flicks.  They have six kids.  Six kids.  Okay.  All right.  All just fucking missionary position.  Ho, ho, pump, pump, come, baby.  Can't have sex for pleasure.  Oh, no, no.  Perish the thought.  You don't think Jesus.  God wouldn't like it.  You don't think Jesus people have sex for pleasure ever? 
[00:46:30]  No.  I know you're not supposed to, I guess.  It is holy to procreate.  Then why?  Why would you have sex for pleasure?  That's a terrible thing to do.  It's like sin.  Why would God create the clit?  Um, I guess to make it so you could stick your wee-wee in there to have a baby, so the  girl goes like, oh, that feels good.  So that's very confusing.  Yeah, it is.  See, it's supposed to feel good.  See, the whole thing with religion is, if it feels good, there better be a purpose for  it religious-wise, or it's bad to do. 
[00:47:00]  It just doesn't make sense.  Meanwhile, I want to thank whoever had the hotel room that I had before me.  Pubic hair?  No, no.  A lot worse than pubic hair.  A lot worse.  Oh, yeah.  You know, uh, you know the, uh, computer desks in the hotel rooms now with the fancy schmancy  computer chairs that are in every, every single, uh, thing?  Well, I went to put my, uh, shoesies on this morning, and I was going to pull up the computer  chair, and they used a little ottoman to put my, my foot on and, and tie my shoe. 
[00:47:30]  And, uh, I pulled the chair out, and, uh, it just dried cum where dried cum would be on  a computer seat if you jerked off in your computer seat.  Oh, yeah.  So front and center?  Yep.  We're just kind of dribbled out?  Right there.  No, it looks like he just, like, pushed his cock down and came all, like, full load all  over the fucking seat.  And, and you stay in nice hotels when you stay overnight. 
[00:48:00]  Hey, even nice hotels, people jerk off.  No, I, you know, I'm just thinking, like, wow.  Yeah, you know what, I guess you're right about that.  So I pushed that chair back in, and I was like, oof.  But I think the nice.  Licked it up.  The difference, though, is.  Ted Flex.  I think the difference, though, is that nice hotels have a sperm cleaning service.  Yeah.  They, they know how to get rid of the, the sperm.  You know what the problem is, though, with those.  Shitty hotel rooms and motel rooms, they just go, ah.  It goes along with the decor.  Just leave it.  The problem is, with those new fangled seats that are in a lot of the hotels, they're almost 
[00:48:30]  a mesh where you sit.  You know, it looks like a futuristic space chair, almost.  And it's a mesh.  And you could tell that, like, I guess the maid tried to clean it up, but all the cumzies  got in the mesh.  And it just, it's just fucking cumzies.  So I, I, I pushed the chair back in.  It just, I shan't be sitting in that chair.  Jesus.  It was awful.  Just a big fucking, big mess. 
[00:49:00]  It's like, come on, man.  Don't fucking cum on the chair.  Could you?  Go forward.  Come on the carpet.  And just rub it in.  Is it a shag carpet?  It's shaggy enough.  That gets a little crusty, doesn't it?  A little crusty, but, you know, they vacuum it at least.  Can't vacuum a chair like that.  Yeah.  All right.  Well.  Thanks for the cumzies.  Norton was on Hannity.  We were talking about this before the break.  While discussing health care, Jim cracks a Valtrex joke.  And totally throws Nicole and Nick Poore. 
[00:49:30]  Who is she?  I don't know.  She, she's, people know who she is.  She's some Republican girl.  Oh, is she?  Okay.  She was very nice.  Was she a blogger or?  Don't know.  You don't know?  No.  She was white.  Oh, she's a Republican strategist.  Oh, she's a strategist?  Yes, yes, yes.  All right, let's listen to how it went down last night on Hannity.  All right, so you got the senator elected in Massachusetts, the 41st vote against health care.  All right, so then, help me out here.  So, then they say, okay, well, we don't need the 60 votes.  We'll go to 51 votes, and we'll add more taxes, and we'll increase the price tag. 
[00:50:00]  And I'm thinking, how great is this if you're a conservative?  Because they're guaranteeing conservative victory.  Sean, all I care about with health care is whichever size saves me money on Valtrex.  That's all you want.  That's all I want.  Cheaper herpes medication.  I mean, I don't know.  All right, now you've lost control.  That was, you know.  I'm going to be a total hit success after this comment.  So, this is great.  Awesome.  Okay.  I think that, oh, my gosh.  He threw you with that one, didn't he?  Well, it's insane, but it's good.  It's funny. 
[00:50:30]  Once again, he has come out with a health care, the health care reform bill that, okay, that  is, once again, they're saying it's going to be deficit neutral.  And it's not, it's not going to be, you can't expand health care.  Wow.  Did you throw her off?  She was like, ha, ha, ha, ha, Ed Norton.  When at first she goes, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That laugh she does at first is just, she's horrified.  You horrified her with your herpes. 
[00:51:00]  Do you believe, you see where the opportunity to go, what, a little close to home, but it  would have been a funny line.  A little close to home would have been right over the top.  She would have fucking fell.  But I didn't want her to be uncomfortable.  It's like, she was actually really nice.  So, if she was a comedian or if I knew her, I would have, but I didn't know her.  I was like, eh, you know.  Plus, who knows?  You know.  It was, it was good.  She was shaking.  But that wasn't a harsh joke.  No, but for her.  It's a great joke.  But looking to myself, it wasn't like I meant funny, you know.  Something tells me she doesn't hear a lot of jokes like that. 
[00:51:30]  You know, that's just my guess from looking at her and the Republican background kind  of a thing.  The other guy there, I keep forgetting his name.  Bob Beckle.  Yeah.  He loved you, man.  He was laughing his ass off at your show.  At one point, he just put his face in his hands and was, was like shaking, laughing at  something Jimmy said.  It was great.  Yeah, he was cool, man.  He was a, he's a, I think he's a Democratic strategist or something.  He's a very, very liberal dude.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  You could tell.  But he's a, he's a kind of brash, loud guy. 
[00:52:00]  Brash.  Brash.  Brash boy.  So, yeah, wow.  I hadn't heard that.  She really did get tossed.  Yeah.  This sweet boy tossed somebody for a loop.  Usually women are thrown by a loop due to my adorableness.  Well.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, sure.  Okay.  Sometimes.  My cheeks pinchableness.  I guess the Aborigines are mad at that Russian ice dancing act.  What ice dancing act?  Remember we were watching it yesterday that they were dressed like natives? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  I was too busy watching Olympic hockey, but I guess we did see the highlights.  Yeah, yeah, it's been all over the news.  Like, like yesterday they showed this couple, they're dressed like, I guess, Aborigines.  Okay.  And they got like plants on them and, and they're wearing leotard, full body leotard that's supposed  to look like tanned skin with, uh, like white, um, almost body art all over them.  And they just look like they came out of the fucking jungle or some shit. 
[00:53:00]  And the Aborigines are mad because they, they dress like that.  I'm just mad because they have ice dancing in the Olympics.  It is a horrible, no one should watch this thing.  It's not even like figure skating where you're like, all right, that's, uh, it's, it's gay  and all, but it's kind of graceful.  And you could, you could understand when a guy picks up a girl, flings her, she spins  around three times and lands on one blade.  Sure.  You could appreciate the, you know, but difficulty in that this is just, and they're dancing 
[00:53:30]  on the ice all stupidly.  But we don't know shit because remember yesterday we were bitching and complaining that NBC showed  ice dancing instead of that amazing hockey game.  Yeah.  You know, the ratings came out and a lot of people had to fucking, you know, let me know  about it on Twitter.  I appreciate it, but I still believe what I believe that if you're going to be, uh, hosting  the Olympics on your channel, you got to show hockey over ice, uh, ice dancing and it never  happened and it shouldn't be about the ratings. 
[00:54:00]  Cause I think, I think hockey is way more important as far as Olympic competition goes  than the stupid ice dancing.  But with that said, uh, hockey did 8.8.2 million, I think just short of the record for MSNBC.  Yeah.  The only, the, the only program that did better was election coverage for MSNBC when  Obama became president, uh, and that was barely beating out the hockey game.  Barely.  Like it was like very close and ice dancing ready for this.  I think, I think the number was 23, 24, maybe 26 million. 
[00:54:30]  I forgot something in the twenties.  So you got to think about it this way, 20 something million people compared to hockey  got 8.2.  So pretty much three times the audience.  Yeah.  It, it, they know.  Yeah.  Things like, look, but so you think you can dance dancing with the stars that there's all  kinds of dancing shows that kill in the fucking ratings.  They know that this is going to do well and this is what middle America and people, you 
[00:55:00]  know, want to see.  But they're, but, but hockey, you're going to get hockey fans.  You're not going to get like middle America people that aren't interested in hockey to  watch.  But does it represent the Olympics?  If you're the Olympic committee, I think you would be mad because they're, they're looking  at what is going to get, give them a, the bigger ratings.  It's there.  Yeah.  It's there for people to watch sports fans.  Wouldn't wouldn't sports fans, real sports fans wouldn't watch ice dancing over hockey. 
[00:55:30]  No, but they're not looking for sports fans.  They're looking for fucking people that watch those stupid.  But is that okay?  Is what I'm getting at.  Should they just go for what is going to bring in the ratings for the network?  Yeah, what are they, what's their moral fucking conundrum?  No, they know.  I don't know.  But the Olympic committee takes everything so, they sell advertising.  Olympic committees takes everything so seriously that I'm just wondering.  They sell advertising.  The network pays a licensing fee to the Olympics. 
[00:56:00]  So they're making a fucking money hand over fist.  And then the, the fucking, uh, and I did say hand over fist.  You were right though.  And the, uh, then the network has to figure out a way to recoup their money with advertising.  So they're going to put on their big network, the fucking thing that's going to get the  most viewers.  Right.  It has nothing to do.  Yeah.  Hockey.  Sure.  A little more action than two people dressed like fucking, uh, uh, uh, aborigines dancing  around on the ice, chasing each other's asses.  All right. 
[00:56:30]  Horrible Russian dance.  And Russia doesn't know.  I'm surprised they didn't come out in blackface.  Oh, wait, what, what's the outrage by the way?  I guess the aborigines are kind of mad that, uh, they dress like aborigines.  So it's almost like a blackface thing.  They meant, like if, uh, they came out, like if, you know, don't dress that way, came out  dressed like, uh, don't dress that way when you're in the jungle or wherever the hell you  live, put on some clothes, put on some clothes, take the leaves out of your armpits.  What do they look like?  Can I see the photo? 
[00:57:00]  They look stupid, but who really dresses like that should be able to see this on TV?  Well, that's true.  Yeah.  If you really still wear leaves, how about you fucking just sit behind a tree and fucking  shut your mouth?  Yeah.  Eat a piece of bark.  How did they know?  Some people are still with me.  They're saying it's bullshit because a lot of people didn't have MSNBC.  So there were a lot more people that would have watched the hockey if it was on NBC.  Because I think some of the, whether it's Dish Network or one of the, one of the like 
[00:57:30]  Dish Network type fucking companies don't have MSNBC.  I don't think it would have been 20 mil.  No, I know.  I know.  I know I'm losing this argument big time and that's fine.  I just don't.  They know what's going to get the ratings.  They've worked it out with a slide rule.  I guess I got to realize that it's not about the sports fans when it comes to the Olympics.  No.  You know what I mean?  The almighty dollar.  Like, for example, Mad Dog Radio.  You think he spent any time talking about ice dancing?  Ah, pretty good sport. 
[00:58:00]  You got to give him credit.  Coming out like an Abernone is.  It's kind of hard to keep those leaves in the upper, up your ass crack.  It's scared around.  A couple of fruits.  I think the guy was a home flaming homosexual.  What do you think?  Take any calls.  I wish Mad Dog would go down that road.  When he does our show, we get a little edgy and he gets very, very nervous.  Fucking hysterical.  Very nervous when we get edgy with Mad Dog.  Let's say hi to Mike in Washington. 
[00:58:30]  Mike.  Thank you, Ken.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, Mikey?  Hey, I was just going to say, you're kind of missing a point with that, with the hockey  and stuff, because out here on the West Coast, hockey was over at 7 o'clock.  Yeah.  All that other stuff didn't start until, you know, 8 o'clock out here, so they got all  the viewers out here after the game.  Oh, I see.  Because they tape delay everything.  Oh, right, right, right.  So the hockey was on, and then they got to see the NBC coverage, right? 
[00:59:00]  Right.  It was on after it, because the game was over at 7 out here.  All I'm saying is, I'm a big fan of the Olympics and sports, I guess sports in general, and  I'm not even watching the NBC coverage.  All the real stuff is happening on the USA Network and MSNBC, because they're showing the  events as they're happening.  Yeah.  You know, with this Twitter and this Facebook and everything else, they can't hold back  results.  So I know who's winning the gold medals.  So there's no real surprise there when you're tuning in the NBC coverage.  Did we get the poor curling girl crying because the fans were fucking taunting her? 
[00:59:30]  Well, I know it's a big story.  How awful is that?  You Canadians, you're a bunch of pricks.  Does anyone know this story?  I know it's the headline.  Canadian curling fans leave Danish curler in tears.  The Danish curling girl, she missed like...  Did she get in trouble for using a Danish?  No, she was not using a Danish.  She threw a Danish in there, sweeping it.  And there was two crullers. 
[01:00:00]  Sweet bitch.  What this is about, curling usually doesn't get a lot of fans.  No, it's supposed to be...  They usually just do that dumb curling thing in front of maybe a few people.  So they're not used to having real crowds that are a little rowdy because they're at the  Olympics cheering them on.  And the Canadians are getting rambunctious, I think.  They're getting a little rambunctious.  And they really...  It's almost like a gentleman's kind of sport, too. 
[01:00:30]  Curling.  That's what I was reading.  Like golf, you're not supposed to be screaming when the guy's teeing off.  And curling is very similar.  Until that rock goes, the stone, you're supposed to be pretty quiet.  And they were taunting this girl.  Yeah.  And she screwed up twice and just was standing on the ice crying.  Do they have this?  The poor little Danish girl.  Do we have this clip?  It's somewhere out there.  I'm sure we'll get it. 
[01:01:00]  Is it the Danish girl that...  Put Steve on it.  Is it the Danish girl that was topless?  Tell the wall to tell Steve to find it.  Is it the Danish girl?  I don't know, but she was cute.  Let it be known, Steve, that Ant was taking a shot at you right there, okay?  What?  Anthony.  How could I miss?  Not Opie.  For what's out of a barn?  Anthony was.  By the way, huge curling fan, Andy Levy.  Oh, I know, and he's coming in.  Huge.  Wait, I thought it was a joke.  I've been following him on Twitter, and I'm with Anthony.  We both thought it was a joke. 
[01:01:30]  I liked it at first, but enough with this dumb fucking curling thing.  Enough already.  Yeah, I can't tell you.  People like it.  I think he likes it, too, now.  It's like shuffleboard.  Is there a...  There should be a curling app.  There should be a curling app where you kind of do it like...  Because I got a shuffleboard one, and it's fun, and you go...  But then you got to take your finger and go...  Shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka, and get the thing in there.  Nobody will like that.  I would love it.  Yeah, you go like that.  Curling app.  And then you hold the phone towards your face, and a load shoots on it.  That should be the curling app.  I think a curling app would rule. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, I got a shuffleboard one, and it's fun.  So all they have to do is...  Like shuffle bowling, too?  Figure out the sweeping part.  Ka-chunk.  Yeah, the sweeping part.  Anthony, I didn't hear you.  The Danish girl, was that the topless girl that we've been talking about?  I don't know.  Her name was Madeline something, was it?  Madeline.  Albright.  Madeline Albright.  Oh, there is a curling app.  Thank you.  Oh, there is.  I knew there would be.  You can't have curling without an app.  Fuck, now I've got two things to do with my iPhone.  Paper toss and curling app.  Nice. 
[01:02:30]  Madeline Albright.  I might have to start carrying my iPhone around just so I can play those two games.  There's a curling downloadable game for Xbox 360 while I'm on it.  Is there one for the Wii?  Oh, I...  The Wii would probably make sense.  It could be just air sweeping in your living room.  Oh, with your Wiimote?  It could be air sweeping?  Take your Wiimote, shove it in your asshole, and spin it.  People still talk about the hockey.  Somebody said, no way, Opie, flip them, and hockey does better on NBC. 
[01:03:00]  I would love to think that's true, but who knows?  Who the fuck knows?  Eric, Ontario, what's up?  Hey, did you know that this is supposed to be the last Olympics that the NHL is going to let their players go?  Why is that?  Why is that?  Well, according to Mr. Bettman, NHL is all about the business, and the NHL makes no money during this two-week shutdown period.  So they have to rework their agreement if they're going to let them back in for 2014. 
[01:03:30]  I think Bettman also realizes that Olympic hockey kind of makes the NHL look a little, a little, I don't want to use, I was going to use the word inferior, but I mean, these games have been just extremely exciting.  And I think a lot of people have noticed that, that the average NHL game isn't as exciting as the average Olympic hockey game.  I mean, there's different circumstances, obviously.  Every game means everything in Olympic hockey, and the NHL has 80, what is it, up to 80-some-odd games a year. 
[01:04:00]  How about ice dancing with checking?  Would you not think that the Olympics would be a great marketing strategy for the NHL, though?  I would think so.  But you get all these, you get the, going back to the ice dancing, I don't really agree that it should be there either.  It's just ballroom dancing with some blades on your feet.  But you get a whole demograph of people sitting there, and they say, okay, well, let's go over and watch a hockey game.  They've never really paid attention to it before now.  Hey, it's an NHL game afterwards. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, I think it's great marketing for the NHL.  A lot of people on Twitter said, oh, because of you, I'm watching Olympic hockey, and now I'm into hockey.  I'm like, get the fuck out of here.  But they're like, no, man.  The U.S.-Canada game turned a lot of people into hockey because it was so amazing.  How did the U.S. do?  They won 5-3.  It was one of the most exciting games I've ever seen.  Is that the gold?  Definitely in â€“ no, no, no, no, no.  They still got more games to play.  Canada plays Germany tonight, I think, 7-30.  They've got to win that game big time.  And the U.S. plays â€“ when does the U.S. play again? 
[01:05:00]  Tomorrow?  I think it's tomorrow night.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's say hi to Brian in Florida.  Brian.  Brian.  Hey, Hope, there's a deck of sports for Wii has curlings.  Ah, deck of sports for Wii.  Wii curling's got to be so exciting, so gay.  It's actually really, really cool.  What?  Why don't we go curling for real?  I guess there's a place in Jersey we could go to.  I'm going to drive to Jersey to go curling? 
[01:05:30]  Ah, we'll take a field trip.  We'll film the whole thing.  Look at that.  We'll get silly.  Yeah.  Get a curling jersey?  Maybe.  Thank you, Brian.  Nice throw, Lou.  Is that what it looks like on the Wii?  Sorry about that.  That's a good fucking line.  I love that.  Never gets all those stupid godmodels.  Stupid Lou.  Curling game looks almost doable for the Wii. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, you know?  Almost doable.  Come on.  You've got your Wiimote.  And I'm sure you do have to take your Wiimote and sweep.  Oh, how stupid would that look?  So you're beating off in your living room?  Oh, let's go to George in Tampa.  George.  George.  Hey, good morning.  How are you doing, guys?  All right, George.  Hey.  Hey, listen.  You know, this ridiculous ice dancing.  The Aborigines all annoyed.  You know, I've seen the National Geographic many times.  I don't ever recall them sitting at the Aborigine sports pub watching ice dance. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, we were kind of bringing that up.  The fact that how do they even know if they're not really watching TV?  You know, Ed, I still don't know why they're pissed.  It's like those Aborigines, though.  Probably like the American Indians that kind of aren't on a reservation and doing all that stuff.  They're just kind of, you know, sitting at home watching TV.  Misbehaving like regular people.  They've got to stop blaming us.  They should have taken some business classes.  Where are they going to take it?  What the fuck? 
[01:07:00]  You only have yourself to blame.  Oh, shit.  What?  He's right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  That's it.  Well, you know, you're the one that makes a fucking leaf hat and wears it.  How do you stop making houses out of leaves?  Right.  Anyone that could be talked into giving up their entire village for a leaf hat.  They're frightened of the choo-choo train.  Yeah.  They're so scared of the choo-choo.  And then Whitey built it.  Yeah.  You know, we built it.  You're frightened of it.  They probably should have stayed at school. 
[01:07:30]  Not give away all your land for a trinket.  Right.  A shiny little rock.  And then you come back and blame us?  Yeah.  Here's something you can look at.  The sun will glint off it.  Wow.  It's a god.  Yeah, sure.  It's a god.  All right.  Now get the fuck out of here.  We own this billion acres.  No.  Blaming us.  Yeah.  Make a necklace out of this and watch the shiny beads glow when the sun hits them.  You blithering idiots.  Who was the dope that didn't see that Manhattan would be this amazing place someday? 
[01:08:00]  You can't even get to it.  Unless you're in a canoe.  Right.  They would think of that.  Like, yeah, good.  These idiots.  You can't even get to that island without a canoe.  And you're mad at us?  Then there it is.  Bridges being built in buildings.  Oh, well, what did we fuck up?  You think they're having a bunch of we could have had a V8 moments?  Knocking their head, the feathers fall off.  Oh, those engines.  Even the casino ones don't look like Indian, you know, engines. 
[01:08:30]  They're regular business guys.  Regular.  I think you only have to have a certain amount of percentage of blood in you.  And it's like nothing.  Earl claims to be part Indian.  Part Cherokee.  It's like, just shut the fuck up.  You're a black guy.  He's part Cherokee.  The rest, idiot.  The Cherokee idiot.  Yeah, but he won a gold medal in the Olympics.  So congratulations to Earl.  Earl?  Yeah.  The speed skater.  The speed skating?  Yeah.  Looked like a bloated Earl.  A little bloated. 
[01:09:00]  Bloated Earl?  Bloated Earl.  But the biggest bloated Earl was fucking Precious.  I fucked up yesterday, man.  I fell asleep watching Precious.  Jesus.  What nightmarish dreams I was having.  Did you really have nightmare dreams?  No.  But I fell asleep maybe, I guess, two-thirds of the way through.  Three-quarters, somewhere around there.  But because I was very sleepy.  I was in a hotel bed watching it on the hotel, you know, movies on demand. 
[01:09:30]  And, yeah, I fell asleep.  But it was really good.  I didn't want to fall asleep.  It wasn't boring.  It was fucking great.  Monique, what a cunt.  Oh, my God.  She was believable, right?  Watching that, I'm thinking, she's got to win the Oscar for that.  But do you think she's a really good actress?  Or she's really...  Or she's really...  Or she's kind of like that in real life.  If she's really like that, I pity anybody that has to deal with her. 
[01:10:00]  Hysterical.  You know what was great?  The amount of times that dumb fatty got bashed in the back of the head with something.  Like a cartoon character.  It was like a cartoon.  When she's like, I couldn't get your cigarette.  But I got the numbers.  But I couldn't box it.  I didn't have enough money.  And she's washing the dishes.  And I guess Monique didn't like that answer.  So she just wails like an ashtray at the back of her head.  And down that bitch goes. 
[01:10:30]  And has a great memory of her father fucking her.  Holy shit.  Jesus.  I know, hot.  It was horrific.  And she is just painful to look at.  Yeah.  Like a look at her.  What, the girl?  Yes.  Well, you've seen her in these interviews.  She doesn't look that bad.  Fuck the interviews.  Whatever they did to her.  No, I've seen the difference between the clips and the interviews.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's drastic.  I mean, yeah, she's still a fat pig in real life.  But she's...  No, she's greasy in this.  She's like...  They greased her up.  They put oil on her and greased her up. 
[01:11:00]  And when she takes that bucket of chicken, I am roaring.  Roaring laughing.  She's just eating that motherfucking shit.  And then she pukes.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Funny ass movie from the beginning.  Look at that big fat face.  It looks like they took Earl down to the gas station and went...  Hear this.  Earl, take him to the gas station.  Put the hose in his mouth.  Pfft.  Pfft.  Pfft.  Pfft.  Pfft. 
[01:11:30]  Jesus, Anthony.  Pfft.  All right.  How many pounds?  180 PSI?  That's good for her head.  Jesus.  This big fat air-blown Earl head.  Look at her.  Look at her with that face.  Mmm.  And she's got that mouth that always goes down like she's frowning.  Her skin looked like a hoeshy bar left out in the sun.  Like it's just got this glaze on it and shit.  She has actually really good skin.  Like there's no blemishes, no nothing. 
[01:12:00]  No, but she...  Well, it's stretched out.  It's not good skin to Anthony.  Pimples shot off it.  It's not good skin to Anthony, Jimmy.  Not a fan of the shade.  There's one issue with her skin.  Of color.  Right.  Jesus.  I was like...  But when she's looking in the mirror at one point and she's trying to like make her stupid bangs  and put like clips in her hair, she sees in the mirror this blonde girl.  This blonde white girl.  So she's just like wanting to be like that.  That was a good scene, actually.  Yeah, that was a good one. 
[01:12:30]  She has these fantasies of people that love her and she's dancing and everything.  And meanwhile, she's just getting kicked in the ass by these gangster guys and thrown on her face.  They're just treated like a pile of shit that she is.  But yeah, she does have...  It is sad when you see her little daydreams.  It's always a handsome gentleman in her dancing about.  And he's kissing her neck and everything.  Yeah.  And then the reality just beats her in the face as Monique fucking heaves a TV on her head.  Did they explain why she doesn't want to be a pretty in shape black girl? 
[01:13:00]  She's fucking, you know, been raised like that a whole life.  No, you said she sees a white girl, right?  Oh, in the mirror?  Yeah.  Yeah, she said, well, I think that's the accepted fucking, you know, she wants to be accepted and stuff.  And that's her idea of the woman that would be, you know, perfect and beautiful, beautiful white girl, blonde hair, you know.  And you can see the environment she was raised in.  Nothing there said eat healthy and take care of yourself. 
[01:13:30]  She's like, you know, I'm going to school.  I'm going to school.  And Monique is just like, you go to the welfare.  You get your ass down to the welfare.  Man, it's fantastic.  It was rolling.  Do you still have your copy?  I got to see this movie.  I do, yeah.  Sure.  I want to see all the nominated movies.  Yeah.  Monique is really good in it, though.  I think she's a good woman.  And so is the lead.  So is Gabriela.  I don't think she should win an Oscar for it.  So what?  Monique wins best supporting actress in it?  I think best supporting. 
[01:14:00]  She did a really good job of being just a fucking, what a piece of shit she is.  That scene with fucking, which I didn't even know, Mongo.  Mongo, the mongoloid kid.  She calls him a monster.  Yeah.  When social services comes over and she's got to hold the baby.  Give me my wig.  It's fantastic.  It's hysterical.  Like, I was laughing at some of the parts at how horrific it was. 
[01:14:30]  She was great, man.  Yeah.  Awesome.  That's not the type of movie you usually like seeing, right, Ant?  No.  I just, I was flipping through and there was like, what am I going to watch?  2012?  Whatever the fuck that stupid ass end of the world movie is.  I wasn't going to watch that.  And then there were a couple of other ones.  Men Who Stare at Goats.  So I was like, ah, precious.  Let me give this one a whirl.  Within 15 minutes, my sides hurt.  I was crying laughing.  Oh, that fucking fat piece of shit. 
[01:15:00]  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  I think you missed the message of the film.  I know.  It was hysterical.  I even Twittered, she's a hoot.  I was laughing at the fat piece of shit.  It's not what they were going for.  You don't know.  Well, they got me.  I want to change gears slightly because this popped up yesterday on Twitter.  And I want to get into this a little deeper.  We start with Jerry in Maine.  Jerry.  Hi, boys.  Hey, Jerry.  How are you?  Pretty good, man.  Jimmy, happy birthday to you, Joe. 
[01:15:30]  Hi, Jerry.  Thank you.  God bless.  Well, listen.  In Lost last week, there's a screenshot on something called Lostpedia, which shows all  the names on the ceiling in Jacob's cavern or something like that.  Yeah.  There are two names which caught my interest.  One was Sheckler, assigned to number 197.  And the other was Hargis, assigned number 202.  No way. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  And a few people are saying that they have to be Opie and Anthony fans.  That have to be Photoshopped.  And I'm wondering if, yeah, I'm wondering if it's Photoshopped.  I'm wondering if this is, you know, are just our imaginations.  Like, I want to get into this a little bit.  There's no fucking way.  Because there's a few people that have brought this to my attention.  I want to see it.  It says Sheckler, Hargis, and the numbers are 197 and 202, which, of course, are the channels  here on Sirius and XF.  I'll tell you why I think it's a goof, because...  You think it's just a coincidence?  No, I think it's made up by a fan. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, you think someone just Photoshopped it or something?  Yeah, because I think that those numbers represent Hurley's numbers.  That's my opinion on it.  Well, the ones with the...  No, there's a whole bunch of brand...  No, you go ahead.  The ones with the survivor...  No, you go ahead.  It's your show.  The ones with the survivor, the people that are still alive, are Hurley's numbers.  Right, that's what I think.  The dead people are scratched out, and there's a fuckload of dead people that we don't even  know what their names are.  Like, I saw names that I had no idea who they were, and it was all the people that had died 
[01:17:00]  over the years as they were trying to find, you know, the chosen one there to take over.  Right, maybe this isn't as hilarious as I thought it was.  No, it's more interesting than hilarious.  If it actually was on there, that would be funny, but I cannot honestly...  I believe that Sheckler and Hargis would be up there, which would be really funny, but...  Anthony, I'm telling you, there's a screen cap on Lostpedia, which... </pre>
