<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with chaotic banter between Opie and Anthony, immediately launching into a "FU Friday" segment.  Listeners, including a persistent caller named John repeatedly trying to reach Carol Miller (resulting in hilarious misconnections involving a phone booth and an air traffic controller), offered their own "FUs," targeting everything from a high school for bad grades and an ex-boyfriend for denying sex to mosh pit attendees at a Dream Theater concert and Fiona Apple.  Other targets included the *Daily News* (for both its John Starks photo and wrestling coverage), Reverend Al Sharpton, and Mayor Giuliani's cab-hailing difficulties. Opie and Anthony contributed their own "FUs," one aimed at a company that failed to deliver a foosball table and another at the *Daily News*. Opie shared an anecdote about subpar Knicks tickets from a former boss, and the hosts discussed AOL chat rooms and their past experiences with online pornography. A caller recounted a friend's brush with the law involving a burglary and a Canadian border issue.  The hosts also mentioned a Red Peters song and the recurring theme of "dump sweats."  A Fox News reporter's fandom of the show was also mentioned.  Later in the broadcast, Psycho Mark and a friend joined, sharing humorous and outrageous stories from their college radio days.  The show then delved into a sexually explicit and offensive discussion centered around Bill Cosby and his alleged sexual assaults, featuring a fictional Cosby stamp and lengthy, graphic conversations about anal sex fueled by numerous caller contributions. A child caller, Andrew, recounted a visit from Hillary Clinton to his school.

Jamie-Lynn Sigler (Meadow Soprano) then appeared as a guest, engaging in lighthearted yet inappropriate banter with the hosts.  The conversation covered her experiences on *The Sopranos*, including anecdotes about co-stars, filming locations, and unsettling fan mail.  Questions about her weight and eating disorder were raised, prompting a somewhat uncomfortable response.  Callers ranged from those asking straightforward questions to those making inappropriate or bizarre comments and requests, including one memorable call from "Spaz," a *Who Wants to be a Millionaire* contestant. A particularly bizarre conversation occurred with a caller impersonating Ron Reagan, engaging in highly inappropriate and sexually explicit remarks about Nancy Reagan and his own health.

The show continued with a segment where listeners shared what they learned from the show, resulting in more nonsensical and often sexually suggestive statements referencing anal sex (including detailed accounts from Dawn), Bill Cosby, the Reagans, Julia Child, and other celebrities in absurd and crude contexts. The hosts also discussed a listener's bathroom sex encounter at a roadshow and an awkward moment involving a caller named Meadow.  Comedy CDs by Brian Regan and Bill Hicks were played. Listener shout-outs were derided as "gay" and "retarded." The segment, and the entire broadcast, concluded with Kimberly being abruptly hung up on and the hosts signing off.  The possibility of a spontaneous St. Patrick's Day bar visit and plans for a webcam featuring "Spaz" were mentioned.  Throughout the entire broadcast, highly offensive and crude language was prevalent, and the conversation frequently shifted between various topics with little apparent structure.

I'm a 20-year fan that's just trying to reach her and they keep trying to find her for me.  Hey, well, I'm a 30-year-old con ed worker.  You reached a phone booth.  How can I help you?  You've got to be kidding me. 
[00:03:30]  No, I'm not kidding you.  Who's this?  Are you serious?  Because I was just on the phone with N.E.W.  And they kept connecting me and connecting me and connecting me.  Well, they connected me to a phone booth.  Great.  All right, thanks.  Who's this?  I just told you, I'm a fan of N.E.W. that's trying to reach Carol Miller, and I don't know how it's going to be.

This is United Flight 367 Heavy.  Hello?  Yes, this is Air Traffic Control.

This is United Flight 7 Heavy.  Can you somehow connect me back to Carol Miller's car phone?  I'm trying to land an airliner, ma'am.  Well, it's a crossing of wires.  I apologize.

[00:04:30]  Oh.  Oh.  It's so cool.  I have nothing to do.  Dudes with dudes.  I think every time we open our mouths, we're pissing someone off.  Opie and Anthony.  Yes, yes.  We're out of control.  We're so wacky.  All right, knock it off.  1027 WNEW.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey. 
[00:05:00]  Hey, gang.  It's FU Friday.  Yes, it is.  With your pals, Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  We're here.  Phone line is 212-757-1027.  You can send your FUs in to whoever you like through the fax line, 212-957-9639.  Or you could use the instant feedback through the WNEW.com webpage.  Okay, just click on our section and you'll find us there.  Also, a bunch of people want us to start promoting, like, AOL chat rooms. 
[00:05:30]  Really?  Yeah, we did it yesterday, and I guess it was a huge hit.  I guess there's Opie and Anthony chat rooms all over AOL.  I believe in Town Square.  So if you want to join some freaks from the radio show.  Not like any of the AOL chat rooms I've ever been in.  I know.  I remember when I used to go to the AOL chat rooms, it was usually to trade pornography.  That was the best.  Remember that?  Those days.  Remember before?  I mean, we're talking before the Internet really had websites that were just chock full of porno. 
[00:06:00]  Everyone had it, but there was no real place that it was stored.  So you had to trade it.  You trade it.  You go into a chat room and you're like, hey, any GIFs, any GIFs, any GIFs?  Yeah, I'm looking for JPEGs.  JPEGs?  Of, like, anal.  Anal?  You got them?  And then all of a sudden you're a male.  You've got mail.  Bing, bing, bing.  You're like, oh, oh, I've got some new ass pictures.  I'll trade you naked pregnant pics.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  But now you can just find it on the web.  You've got mail.  You've got mail.  And it was like getting a gift, right, Anthony?  Yeah.  But then you'd have to send back some.  Uh-huh.  I'd always bail out of the room at that point.  No, you were one of those dirtbags.  Yeah.  Just take my freebies and leave.  I used to hate those people.  I promise they'll send back if you send me one and you send them one and then they bolt on you.  You've got cash.  All right.  Well, do you have any FUs today? 
[00:07:00]  Let me think.  Hey, FU to the people that were supposed to deliver my foosball table Wednesday.  What happened?  They never delivered it.  I'm pissed.  What, my foosball table?  Maybe you weren't home when they were delivering it.  That's no excuse.  Isn't it like the cable guy you've got to wait around all day for the pin?  Yeah, for a foosball table.  For a foosball guy to show up?  I bought a foosball table and it hasn't been delivered.  They said Wednesday.  And I tell them the hours I'm going to be home.  And nothing.  Nothing. 
[00:07:30]  No note shoved in the door.  Nothing.  And you're not sharing.  What?  With the show.  What do you mean?  If you bought a foosball table, you've got to, like, bring it into work.  Could you imagine a foosball table in the studio here?  That's for, no, no, that's for my playhouse.  Well, what about the...  Games galore.  Games and fun.  What about the O.P. and Anthony treehouse we're building here?  Have one of the salespeople get us a foosball table.  You know, eventually this studio is going to be completely ours and we're going to make  everyone else broadcast somewhere else.  Somewhere else?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:08:00]  We're going to, like, remodel this whole place.  It's going to be just, I don't know.  That would be pretty cool.  A foosball table.  Yeah, we could just, like, play while we're broadcasting.  We'll have a TV with a PlayStation 2.  Yes.  Hey, hey.  PlayStation 2.  We'll see all the Japs waiting for PlayStation 2.  Yes.  They're all waiting online.  Hey, hey.  Wait for a PlayStation.  Play-station.  Yeah, they're all sitting online waiting for PlayStation 2.  All right.  So your F.U. is to the foosball people, Anthony? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  All right.  It was the family gaming center over there in the mall over in Staten Island.  Okay.  I'm pissed.  Send me my goddamn foosball table.  I'm pissed.  All right.  Well, my F.U. is a little weird, but I think people will understand.  A big F.U. to the Daily News.  Yeah.  The sports page, sports, the back page of the Daily News.  You know, they have the sports, obviously. 
[00:09:00]  Big F.U. to the Daily News for showing a picture of John Starks in a Bulls uniform.  That is sacrilege.  Absolutely sacrilege.  Poor John Starks had to get traded to the Bulls.  He doesn't want to be there.  We're embarrassed for him.  He has to, like, play for the Bulls when, you know, the Knicks just absolutely hate the Bulls.  Always have.  Always will.  Yeah.  And there's, like, John Starks, who was one of the hearts of the Knicks teams over the  years, in a Bulls uniform. 
[00:09:30]  And then the Daily News has to show the picture on the back page of the Daily News today.  Well, the Post has him in a Knicks uniform.  That's why I didn't give the F.U. to the Post, because the Post was smart.  There they show John Starks in the uniform he should have on, the Knicks jersey.  It says, bring back Starks.  There's a chance that the Knicks might get John Starks.  This is basketball, right?  Mark is saying, we care.  This is basketball, right?  Life doesn't revolve around just smoking dope.  There's other things people like to talk about.  And one of them is the Knicks and sports in this town, you ass. 
[00:10:00]  Jesus.  It's a big deal to us Knicks fans.  But, yeah, they're reporting that the Knicks have a chance of getting Starks back.  That would be huge for the Knicks' playoff run.  It would be absolutely huge.  He was good at getting the home runs.  Or is it the touchdowns?  All right, man.  If anyone wants to, like, do sports for our radio show, apply.  Come on.  We need to talk sports a little bit on this radio show.  It's doing great.  I'm pouring my heart out about the Knicks and John Starks, and no one around here cares. 
[00:10:30]  Sorry.  All right.  I would like to, but basketball just ain't my thing.  I understand a lot of people like it, and that's cool, you know.  It's very New York, the Knicks.  Oh, I was upstairs?  Yeah.  You know the old boss, Scott Herman?  Scott, yes.  Who we still truly love for the fact that he brought us to New York and all that?  Yeah.  I went to visit him, and he's the holder of the Knicks.  Tickets.  Ah, yes.  For a keeper.  For WNAWN wins.  The keeper of the ticks.  So you've got to go up there once in a while, and you, you know, you spend some time with 
[00:11:00]  them, and then you start hinting about the Knicks and stuff.  Oh, is that your angle?  What, are you kidding me?  I don't know what your play is.  You think I go up there just to have coffee with them and stuff?  Yeah.  So I shoot the S with them and stuff, and then I start talking about the Knicks casually.  Hey, uh.  I'm like, hey, boss, you know, if you have any tickets laying around, you know, you know who  to give them to, right?  Oh, I've got a couple over here.  So he goes into his little cabin.  He goes into the drawer, and I'm like, oh, yes.  I'm thinking he's going to give me tickets to a really good Knicks game, right, Ant? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  This shows we don't rate at all with the O'Reilly.  Oh, come on.  What did he give you?  Vancouver.  Is that bad?  Yeah, that's bad.  Why?  You get to see the Knicks.  Knicks-Vancouver game?  You want, like, Knicks, Toronto.  You want Knicks-Miami.  Knicks-Celtics is always a fun game to watch.  What's wrong with Vancouver?  They're 18-39, Ant.  Is that bad?  That's really bad, but I don't know.  But I want to thank the boss for giving me a pair of tickets, too. 
[00:12:00]  You're going to see the Knicks, not Vancouver, so who cares?  All right.  I wish he'd come across with some tickets to, like, the Yankees or something when they start playing.  That's what I want to see.  I didn't get any last year.  Nothing.  Maybe a couple of Jets-Giants games during football.  I'll say nothing.  Nothing, nothing, nothing.  Basketball, he's got them out the yin-yang.  We had a ton of Jets tickets last year.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, we did.  No one offered me any.  No one really wanted to go after Vinny went down.  Yeah, that was true.  You know, it was kind of a drag season, and then they turned around and had a really good year. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Considering.  But at first, no one wanted to go to the games.  A lot of his tickets just rotted in that drawer of his.  Rotted.  All right, and we've got to take our first break here.  All right.  It is FU Friday.  On the way, I've got a song for the critics of our radio show.  Oh, you do?  Oh, yeah.  It's pretty funny.  All right.  It's a new song from Red Peters.  Red Peters.  From his new CD.  And we'll play that next.  How's that?  All right.  And more of your phone calls.  Stay there.  Open.  Boring.  Anthony.  Boring. 
[00:13:00]  Producer Rick.  Boring.  Bad.  B-A-A-A-A.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027.  WNEW.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Booty doody.  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Ah, it's FU Friday.  Another fine week of radio almost behind us here, Anthony.  Yeah.  We'll pretty much talk about anything we covered this week. 
[00:13:30]  Just in case you didn't get through during the week when we were discussing certain stuff.  Like a wrap-up.  Like a week wrap-up.  Sure.  Do some closure.  Closure.  Closure.  It's a psychobabble.  You need closure.  Yeah.  If something hits you a little funny this week and you want to discuss a little further,  that's fine as well.  Look, we got some new stuff planned for you as well today.  All right.  John from Forest Hills on the instant feedback.  Oh, get over Starks. 
[00:14:00]  He lost game seven against Houston in 94.  We got Sprewell for him.  Sprewell?  Who's better than him?  I love Starks' heart, but he was so erratic.  You're right.  You are right, John.  I'd rather have Sprewell the choker.  I like a guy that'll choke somebody every so often.  I think he'll just be a good backup, and he would give the Knicks a lot of heart as  they go into the playoffs.  And why not?  Why not bring back Starks?  It would be a big boost for the team in this damn city.  Yeah.  That's all I'm trying to say, if you think about it, really. 
[00:14:30]  Got a little Brian Regan in me today.  That's all I'm trying to say, if you think about it.  We're going to have to play a couple more tracks from Brian Regan's CD.  That went over very, very well yesterday.  Yeah.  We're kind of trying to turn you guys on to the stuff we like, finally.  The music we like, some of the comedians we find funny.  Yeah.  And we're going to expand that concept of our show in the coming weeks, okay?  Absolutely.  All right.  Let's go to Jammer.  Hey, Jammer. 
[00:15:00]  Hey, what's going on?  How are you guys doing today?  Real good.  What's up?  That's good.  That's good.  Hey, on the way home last night, I was listening to, what was it, Don and Mike, the new guys?  Yes.  Yeah.  And they were extending a hand to you.  You're looking forward.  They're coming to New York next week.  They want to sit down and throw down a couple beers with you guys, party, get wasted.  Sure.  I don't think they can party like us, though.  Well, I know you guys are going to show them how to do it, right?  They've got to be, like, what, 15 years older than us.  Are they?  I don't know.  You know, what they do?  I've known some old guys that can party.  No, honestly, we're looking forward to having beers with us, don't you? 
[00:15:30]  I think they sounded right.  The only thing, one of them sounds like Likas, man.  I just can't get over that.  No, no one sounds like that, too.  Well, you listen to one of them.  Come on!  Yeah, exactly, exactly.  What happened?  I'm gone.  Yeah, Likas, we don't talk about him anymore.  Done.  We accomplished our goal.  We got him out of this damn station.  Hey, you did it, man.  You did it.  You did it.  All right, Jammer.  Hey, listen, real quick.  I tune in up in Boston every once in a while.  I'll let you know what else we hear up there when we get up there because you drive a big truck.  Oh, okay.  I know who you are.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:16:00]  I run for Destiny Transport.  Yeah, you're a good guy.  All the guys in the barn listen to you.  You know, they're all...  Yeah, he makes the trips to Boston, to New York all the time.  Yeah, it's a good week.  Cool.  Out of Jersey, man.  All right, Jammer.  Right now, coming out of Anthony's hometown into Static Island.  Got to pay my dues here and get back to New York.  All right, Jammer.  We got to fly.  Have a good one, guys.  We'll talk at you later, right?  Diamond Dust.  All right.  Wrangler.  10-4, good buddy.  All right.  10-4.  Diamond Dust.  Oh, big F you going out to the Bergen Record, the latest media outlet that is convinced that 
[00:16:30]  you and I are going to mornings.  Oh, yeah?  What'd they say?  That we're going to mornings.  Oh.  Well, that's easy.  We already said we're not going to mornings.  A lot of people saying we won't have a choice in the matter.  A lot of people saying, oh, yeah, right, that if the bosses say so, we jump and we go.  That's it.  No.  We're doing too well in afternoons.  We're doing really well in afternoons.  Yes. 
[00:17:00]  We're going to the latest little ratings thing we just got today.  Thank you.  Thank you to our listeners.  Yeah.  And to our critics, go F yourself.  Again.  Again.  Still, yeah.  Please.  I want to play this little ditty for the critics, Anthony.  Yeah.  What is this?  It's a brand new song from Red Peters.  Red Peters has a new CD out.  Uh-huh.  And it's a spelling song, Anthony.  A spelling song.  Okay.  A spelling song, especially for the critics of the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  Take a listen.  Yeah.  All right, Red.  Another fine piece of work from our buddy, our pal, Red Peters, the spelling song off his  new CD.  That rocks.  I kind of like it.  It pretty much says it all, right?  It's wrong of him.  Let's go back to the phones.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We go to Scott.  Scott, what's up?  Oh, hey.  What's going on?  How are you?  Big F you to Columbia High School.  Why?  Because they're failing me in all these classes for cutting school. 
[00:18:00]  Well.  Yes, man.  Well, what do you expect?  You got to show up.  Well, I'm smart enough to do the work.  I might as well get wasted in, you know, in a big F you to end for not liking basketball.  Oh.  By the way.  All right.  Hey, I was watching the, on TV last night, the QVC guy was on.  Yes.  Yeah.  He was going absolutely nuts.  About what?  There was some kind of spring sale that they were having.  They were, like, giving away all these cards.  He reminded me of Chris Farley. 
[00:18:30]  Just his face was all red.  He was sweating.  Yeah, he gets out of his mind, that guy.  He had all the cards, and he was, like, throwing them around.  He was knocking stuff over and stuff.  It was absolutely hilarious.  I love that guy.  I haven't seen him in a while.  Man, he was loving Stan Musil and Sosa and McGuire.  Still selling Sosa and McGuire stuff.  How could there be any more Sosa and McGuire rookie cards out there when they're limited edition?  Sosa and McGuire rookie cards. 
[00:19:00]  We've only been selling these for five years, people.  There's only $8 trillion billied up.  I can't do the voice, Opie.  I'm trying.  I can't do the voice today.  Man, you almost made it through the week.  The voices will be back Monday.  See, I shouldn't delve into the QVC guy with my voice like this.  He's a mess now.  Scott, you just killed him for the day.  All right.  What about the Regis?  How about Kathy Lee quitting?  No, no, no. 
[00:19:30]  All that's going to have to wait until Monday.  We do have good news, though.  We're going to have a call from the former president of the United States of America today.  Yeah, that's easy.  That's all.  You guys suck.  All right.  Thank you.  That won't kill your voice too much.  That doesn't hurt that much.  Okay, very good.  You almost blew out your voice.  I know.  We have four hours to go here today.  I felt that itchy thing going on in the back of my throat.  I'm like, oh, no.  Here it goes.  Hey, Liz, you're next on NAW.  What's up?  Hey, I'd like to give a F-U, excuse me, to my new ex-boyfriend. 
[00:20:00]  New ex.  3.30.  What'd he do?  He broke up at 3.30 in the morning.  He denied me booty.  He denied you booty?  You wanted some sex from him, and he said no, so you broke up with him?  Among other things, but that was a big issue.  And at 3.30 in the morning, you guys called it quits?  Uh-huh.  Last night?  Yep, yelling and screaming.  Yelling and screaming.  Waking up the neighbors.  Uh-huh.  Literally.  Were you over his place, or vice versa?  I was over his place.  I was too drunk to drive. 
[00:20:30]  His sister drove me home.  We fought the whole way home.  Then we woke up the neighbors in my neighborhood.  Really?  Yeah.  It was a big crazy.  But I'd like to give him an F-U.  What did you say?  Do me?  And he said no?  I'm sorry, what?  What did you say?  Do me?  And he said no?  I've been asking him for days.  He's been denying me.  He has no problem taking the BJ's.  No problem with that.  He doesn't want to work at it.  No, exactly.  I'm tired.  Well, we get into those moods, us guys, where we just kind of want you guys to do all the work. 
[00:21:00]  The boy doesn't even have a job, which he's so tired from.  Really?  Yeah.  From all, like, the cracky smoking during the day.  Sounds like a bum.  Sounds like a bum.  Yeah.  Sounds like you might be better off.  I think I am.  All right, Liz.  You guys are amazing.  Well, thank you.  A big F-U to your ex-boyfriend.  Thank you.  And one more thing.  You guys, when you play music, you should try Slipknot.  We like Slipknot.  You're right.  I am.  You're right.  Fabulous.  All right, man.  Thanks so much.  Thanks, Liz. 
[00:21:30]  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Amanda.  Amanda, you're next on NEW.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  What's up?  What's up?  I love you guys.  Hey.  I got two F-Us.  Okay.  One is for Hopi.  Why?  Because you like basketball.  What's wrong with liking basketball?  Well, you know, it's okay that you're a basketball fan, but aren't you an Islander fan, too?  Uh, yes, I am.  See, so that just puts you right in the F-U category.  Why?  Because the Islanders suck.  Well, I know, but you want me to be a fair-weather fan and jump on, uh, I don't know, the Rangers  back or something? 
[00:22:00]  Well, it works for everybody else.  Nah, I can't do that.  And the same thing is...  I don't wear my Islander stuff, uh, anymore.  You don't like it?  Nah, because the management of that damn team doesn't care, so why should they're fans  at this point?  Yeah, well, but they won, like, three games.  I know.  Great.  Wow.  Now, I'll tell you, Amanda, I like the Islanders.  Love the Knicks.  All right.  I used to like the Nets when they played on Long Island, but that's been a while, obviously.  Love the Knicks, uh, Mets, and Jets. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, well, okay, I can forgive you for the Jets, at least.  Really?  Yeah, because I have season tickets for them, but...  You don't like basketball?  No, not really.  I'm five foot two.  I can't reach the basket.  It doesn't matter.  You don't need to be tall to watch the Knicks.  No, but, you know, I got the scarring from gym class in high school.  Yeah.  So, you know, this never worked.  All right.  My second F.U.  Yeah, hit it.  I don't know if you guys ever heard of them, but there's a band named Dream Theater.  I know Dream Theater.  They're awesome.  All right.  I went to the show at Roseland.  Yeah.  All the F.U.  to the people who start mosh pits, all right? 
[00:23:00]  As I said, I'm five foot two.  I got clocked in the head numerous times because of all these, like, little 12-year-old mosh pits.  You know, we should talk about mosh pits.  There's bands you just shouldn't be moshing to.  Dream Theater is not a band you mosh to.  Well, tell all your little listeners, because there was all, like, the super little kid.  Oh, I think it's a Korn concert.  Fully punched somebody in the head.  You're only spending $35 for a ticket.  I don't want to get punched in the head.  Well, let me tell you, I have been in the mosh pit for Korn, and it is one of the sickest pits you'll ever see. 
[00:23:30]  Exactly.  So you bring up a very good point.  It's at a Korn concert, not a Dream Theater concert.  Yeah, Dream Theater is just, you don't mosh to Dream Theater.  You kind of sway back and forth to Dream Theater.  You get those lighters out every once in a while for Dream Theater, you know?  Exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  And F, you know, the guy who also tried to grab my breast when he was trying to get to the front of the stage.  Well, you've got to give it to him.  Well, come on.  My boyfriend didn't even get to enjoy the show because he's worried about all these, you know, jerks trying to grab my breast. 
[00:24:00]  That does kind of suck, going to, like, a concert with the chick and stuff.  Because you can't even enjoy yourself.  You've got to worry about all these dopey-ass guys trying to...  Trying to grab everybody's heart.  Like, top feels.  Amanda, you must have a nice set, though.  Uh, 38 days?  Yeah, there you go.  You're working it.  Yeah, well, you know, when you go to the show, that's all I had.  My arms around the breast and the boyfriend behind me and stuff.  Yeah.  All right, you guys rule syndication now.  All right, thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye. 
[00:24:30]  There she goes, Amanda.  Facts coming in.  Let's go, Rangers.  All right.  Oh, as you see, I'm tooling up over here.  Uh, we got the coffee.  We're going to be set today, Anthony, once again, okay?  We're going to be a mess again.  Let's go to Mary.  A lot of women done checking in today.  Hey, One.  Maybe we'll turn this into Ladies' Day today.  Mary, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Love you guys.  Thank you.  Big F you to the Canadian border.  Why?  Because my girlfriend and I went to drive up there to go visit a friend. 
[00:25:00]  Which border?  Because I've been over many of those.  Johnston.  The one, Ogdensburg, is on the New York side, and Johnston's on the other side.  We went to the Cornwall one also.  Is that the one that's for Montreal, right?  No, we were going to Ottawa.  Oh, Ottawa.  Okay.  No, I haven't been through that one.  Stupid Canada.  Well, it's a pain in the ass to cross the border into Canada.  Totally ridiculous.  So you guys got caught doing what?  Well, I mean, we weren't doing anything. 
[00:25:30]  My girlfriend, like 14 years ago, she was 18 years old, she was asked by somebody who  was, I guess, didn't have a very good reputation to drive her to her, quote-unquote, cousin's  house to pick up a couch or something like that.  Turns out it wasn't the guy's cousin's house, and she ended up getting caught.  But she was sentenced to 10 years, but they dropped it to five years' probation.  Ah, it wasn't a couch either.  It was cocaine.  No, it was not.  It was a couch and, like, two hunting duck things, you know? 
[00:26:00]  It's ridiculous.  What?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You're making no sense.  What was the charge?  The charge was aiding and abetting burglars.  Fifth-degree burglary.  Oh, what?  They broke in somewhere and stole stuff and loaded it into the car?  Yeah, she stayed in the car.  She didn't know it was going to go on until...  The wheelman.  Until they got up.  She wasn't the wheelman.  Until they got up to the house.  And, anyway, so they went to drive away, and the people who owned the cabin stopped them 
[00:26:30]  and stole their stuff in the car, and they called the police.  And, anyway, so she got busted.  But it was 14 years ago, you know, when she was 18 years old.  And so we went to try and go over, and they wouldn't let her through.  And we tried to go someplace else to the Cornwall one, the Cornwall crossing,  and they wouldn't let her go over.  I mean, it was 18 years ago.  Oh, I see.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Okay.  You know?  You're a convicted felon.  You can't go to Canada?  Yeah.  That doesn't make sense.  There must be more to this.  I mean, it was 14 years ago.  Yeah.  Anyway, we were really pissed off. 
[00:27:00]  But that's my big F you.  They suck.  All right.  I hate them.  Well, thank you, Mary.  Okay, thank you very much.  Have a wonderful day, and I love you guys.  Hey, thank you.  Have a great weekend.  Okay, you too.  Bye.  Bye-bye, Mary.  All right.  Well, Ann, we've got to take a break.  Yes.  The last couple days, we've been featuring tracks from Brian Regan's comedy CD.  Very funny guy.  We're going to have him here on the show.  Yeah, he was in here about, God, when we first started here at N.E.W.  Like the second month we were here. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  So we're looking forward to his return visit, and we encourage everyone to go see him.  I'm not sure where he's going to be.  We'll have all those details when we get closer, okay?  Yes.  But here's a track, Lousy and Little League.  I love this one.  Check it out.  We'll be back.  Okay.  Utilize some conflict.  Piss me off, okay?  W-W-W-W-W-W-W.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  And it's F-U Friday.  W-W-W-W. 
[00:28:00]  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 if you want in on the show today.  Psycho Mark's in the studio with a couple of his psychopaths, I believe.  Psycho Mark, who do you got over there?  It's my friend Jack Devaney.  As a matter of fact, we got fired from college radio together.  Oh, really?  All right.  It was quite an interesting incident, if I may say.  Wait, wait, wait.  Psycho Mark used to do college radio.  He ran a college radio station, right?  Psycho Mark?  I couldn't believe it.  He became PD when we left.  I could not believe it.  Of college radio. 
[00:28:30]  Did you hear the stories of Psycho Mark?  He used to, like, um...  Why not?  Can I go into it?  I've heard the dope stories.  There were job interviews with ladies and stuff, right?  Oh, wait a minute.  Was there a casting couch to be part of your little radio team when you were the program director?  Yeah.  Hey, Ben.  Oh, great, Ben.  Here we go.  That's good.  Let's talk about Mark's program director today.  All right, Mark.  So, Mark was a program director of a college radio station.  There's a lot of college kids out there that want to get started in radio, Anthony, 
[00:29:00]  and a good place to start is college radio.  Of course.  And, unfortunately, some of these people had to come across Psycho Mark as they're trying  to get their careers going.  Ben, tell them one of the stories.  There's so many.  How about the story of why you got fired?  How many times did you get fired from the college station?  Like three.  One of my favorite stories was there was the Duck Tours in Boston.  Yeah, that was a stupid story.  And they went by.  What did you say?  You said...  How did you put it?  The Duck Tours.  The Duck Tours used to go by, and everyone would go, quack, quack, quack. 
[00:29:30]  The Duck Tours, for anybody in New York, it's an amphibious vehicle, like an old army  surplus thing, that they load tourists in and then plunge them into the Charles River.  And they go floating around and looking at things.  Yeah, look at this.  It's Boston.  Oh, my God.  It's wonderful.  Not to be confused with the Ted Kennedy Tour, where you don't come back from.  And as I remember it, a couple of years back, one of those duck boats flipped over.  Every so often, they flip over, and a bunch of tourists perish.  And it's the funniest damn thing that happens in that town. 
[00:30:00]  The Duck Tours.  So the Duck Tour is going by.  I'm live on the air.  I'm going, oh, yeah, gee, there goes the Duck Tour.  I'm going to start my own tour.  Instead of driving around the good parts of Boston, we're going to drive around the bad parts of Boston.  And we're going to yell, crack, crack, crack.  Instead of quack, quack, quack.  Right.  And you got fired for that?  Well, I said, oh, we'll go to Roxbury or something.  Roxbury or Chester.  Oh, yeah.  That was predominantly black.  Yeah, very safe neighborhoods up there.  The president of the college got about 15 phone calls within the next three minutes.  Wasn't he sleeping with some of the chicks? 
[00:30:30]  Come on, Ben.  Tell the stories.  Oh, yeah.  Well, tell the stories about how some of the girls got shows on the station.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  What auditions?  They had to have a little audition.  Ed, Ed, Psycho Mark had a casting couch.  Little girls would come to the stage, and they want to start their radio careers,  and they pretty much had to sleep with him to get a show.  Oh, man.  No, wait a minute.  This is getting blown out of proportion.  Oh, yeah.  God, I want to take it.  That's against the law, I believe.  This is totally getting blown out of proportion. 
[00:31:00]  How many of the personalities did you sleep with?  I don't know.  That's kind of a few, right?  A couple, yeah.  A couple.  But, I mean, I didn't give them shows.  Oh, yeah.  It wasn't like that.  Okay, terrific.  Terrific.  Oh, he got that one now.  Awesome.  You're going to hear that clip about a million times today.  Bitch.  Okay, terrific.  About the day you got busted for the clouds coming out of your car right in front of the radio station. 
[00:31:30]  Like Jeff McCauley.  Oh, shit.  Out of a stinking Lincoln.  We're in there meeting with the general manager of the radio station.  There was another kid that didn't like Mark.  So, he came in and there were clouds of just pot coming out of Mark's car right in front of the station.  So, Mark gets the word about that because we have our audio class at four that day.  Mark splits, but only Mark's luck.  The exact same Lincoln parked in his spot.  So, the professor was a little pissed off at that point. 
[00:32:00]  But, Mark has many...  Didn't you also get fired for mooning the whole school or something on closed circuit TV?  Oh, that's right.  Oh, God.  It's all coming back.  Yeah, no, they had a camera inside the studio and it was being fed to all the dorm rooms.  So, all the dorm rooms could watch what was going on at the radio station.  Look at that.  Interactive.  So, as being the program director, I was getting a lot of complaints from some of the female jocks saying,  you know, a lot of guys are calling up saying, nice kids, you know.  And I said, well, geez.  What do they expect?  Well, exactly.  I said, well, we'll have to put an end to this. 
[00:32:30]  So, one day I'm on the air and there's one kid in the dorms that just happened to me.  He would not stop calling me up going, ooh, you look really handsome.  Ooh, I'm going to come down there and give you a rusty compound.  So, finally, I started losing it because he kept calling.  And I started giving the camera the finger and all that.  So, finally, to the point where I got up on the console and I pulled my pants down.  And I mooned the camera.  You mooned the camera.  And the president of the comic had to be giving a tour to about 25 business people while it was being broadcast in the dining hall. 
[00:33:00]  Okay.  Terrific.  So, you've got to know when to use that lighter.  Okay.  Terrific.  Well, thank you, Mark.  What's up, guys?  Here's the studio.  Anthony, what's up?  My brother was on one of those duck tours.  He just started going out with his girlfriend.  He was going out with her for about a week and he decided to go away.  And the town they were in was hosting those duck tours.  That's right.  About two hours into the tour, he broke out with the dump sweats. 
[00:33:30]  And there was nowhere to go.  The dump sweats.  And to make matters worse, they're driving around the duck tour and you just think,  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  We can't get past the dump sweats line.  What is it?  Can you explain what the dump sweats is?  The dump sweats are when you've got to go and you're going to have that accident, 
[00:34:00]  which leads to further into the story.  They got caught in traffic going back.  And the whole time, the captain's like, Who wants to drive the boat next?  And he's hunched over.  He's thinking about jumping in the water now because he's got to let go.  So, on the way back to the hotel, he ended up letting it go in his pants.  Okay.  Terrific.  Terrific.  Really?  Which is a good argument for the tighty-whities because that's the only thing that saved them.  Oh, that's right.  But on the way back to the stall, he took them off and then threw them underneath the toilet. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, sometimes you've got to do that.  I just thought that was amusing.  Good job, Hank.  Syndication yesterday.  Well, we're working on it.  Thank you.  Take care.  A couple more rating trends like today, and I think it'll be inevitable.  Ah.  Got to say that.  Got to thank the listeners once again.  Thanking the listeners, yes, for knowing what show to listen to in the afternoons.  Mark, you're next on WNEW.  What's up?  Hey, how's it going, ONA? 
[00:35:00]  Hey.  You guys are the best.  All I've got to say about that.  I go to Rutgers.  I'm pretty stoned right now, but...  Hey, hey, hey.  Are we funnier when you're stoned?  You've got to just fight no matter what.  It doesn't matter, man.  This sounds better a lot.  Now I'm just a little hungry, but I just big F you to all the fat and ugly chicks at  Rutgers at the bars.  Why?  They're just ridiculous.  You know, you've seen this pretty girl, and she comes up to you, and she smiles, and  looks like she has bice in her mouth.  It's just ridiculous.  Now, one girl looks like a Sasquatch.  It was a horrible night last night, guys. 
[00:35:30]  So fat girls are hitting on you at the bar?  Yeah, you know.  Well, fat girls need loving, too, man.  Yeah, but this girl looks like a Cadillac.  Well, just smoke a lot more pot.  You won't know the difference.  I need to drink some more beer like that, I think.  All right.  By the way, I work at a local club in New Jersey called Shout.  I'd love to have you guys come down.  All right.  We'll be there.  It's a big club.  Now, if you can switch me to someone, that'd be great.  Like how big?  2,000, 3,000 people?  About 2,500.  Really?  Yeah.  All right, because we're trying to figure out where to do the next road show. 
[00:36:00]  It's got to be in Jersey somewhere.  Yeah, it's right in Central New Jersey, guys.  We have diehard listeners.  Central New Jersey might do it.  You know what?  I'm going to put you on hold, and Rick's going to talk to you.  That'll be great, guys.  I really appreciate it.  We'll see what you're about.  Hold on, all right?  Syndication yesterday, guys.  All right.  Yes.  Yesterday.  Let's go to Tara.  Tara, you're next.  You have an F.U. today.  Yeah.  And what's that?  F.U. to Fiona Apple.  You were at the show the other night when she had her little tantrum?  That skinny little bitch.  You know, some of us make our money, and we don't get it for mom and dad. 
[00:36:30]  So when she sings five songs and then goes off, it's like, come on.  Yeah, way to take care of your fans.  I mean, most of us, we don't have a lot of money to throw around to go to concerts,  so we have to sit there.  We see all the concerts that are coming out.  We're like, wow, which one do I really want to go to?  And then you're stupid enough to pick the Fiona Apple show.  Yeah, I knew it, too.  And then she has like a nervous breakdown and a cry fest in the middle of the show.  I was like, I bet you she's going to rant and rave.  I just hope she keeps her mouth shut and just sings, you know?  She lost her frigging mind up on the stage. 
[00:37:00]  She's whacked.  That's great.  Too bad.  Oh, well.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  I love that she went mental on stage.  Glad I didn't pay for tickets, but that might have been better than the show.  Just to see her losing her mind, she puts her face in her hands and starts weeping, blubbering.  Probably big, like, green snot bubbles coming out of her little skinny face.  F.U. to any rock star that has an attitude, like Axl. 
[00:37:30]  Joe, what's going on?  Yo, how you doing?  How you doing?  I just want to jump on the bandwagon with the big F.U. to the Daily News also.  Again, they're jumping on the bandwagon.  Why don't they leave McMahon and the wrestling alone?  Is everything that I like they're going to take off the air?  They got the UFC off.  Now they're getting on the wrestling.  Didn't we go through this two or three years ago with McMahon and the steroids and this?  Yeah, there's a huge article on the darker side of wrestling today. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, forget about it.  Just, yeah.  I mean, just leave it alone.  These are grown men.  They got paid a nice amount of change to do what they're doing.  If they want to put stuff into their body, whether it's right or wrong, I'm not saying it's right or it's wrong.  Just leave them alone and leave something that I like on the air for once.  And Fiona Apple can bob on this.  Thanks, guys.  Very good.  Okay.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Another negative article for wrestling.  WWF, let's see. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, stocked taking a down hit.  Again?  Today.  Had a little rally there for a day.  Oops.  It's got to go up eventually.  It's got to.  At least to pay for our airfare to Los Angeles.  Let's go to John.  John, you're next.  Hey, how's it going, Eddie?  Good.  How you guys doing?  All right.  Listen, I got to ask you to go out to the big Reverend Al.  I'll tell you why.  Why the fine reverend today?  Well, this might surprise you guys, and I don't like to brag, but I got a little news for you. 
[00:39:00]  You ever see his wife behind him in any of these rallies or anything or at any of the demonstrations?  You ever see your Reverend Al's wife?  Uh, no.  Not that you know her, right?  No.  Let me tell you why, because she's not there.  And I'll tell you why to that.  Why?  She's whiter than you and me, buddy.  What?  Reverend Al married himself a white woman?  He hit the grand slam.  He married a white woman.  No way.  I got a lot of good information.  We got to get proof of that.  I saw, I was like, why do you think she's not there? 
[00:39:30]  Give me a picture of her.  Yeah, someone, someone, uh, confirm that for us.  Well, if I had a picture of Reverend Al's wife, I have bigger problems than calling you guys.  You know what I mean?  That's true.  I don't know.  And, uh, he lives in Northern Jersey, by the way.  Yeah.  I mean, let me give you a break.  He ain't going home to Brownsville after these demonstrations.  You know what I'm saying?  And how could he afford a place in Northern Jersey?  Well, geez, I don't know.  How come he's back this minute?  There's a millionaires.  I don't know.  Yeah, he goes into Harlem and stuff and says, uh, we must protect our community.  Our.  Our.  You got to picture this.  Uh, I don't want to get myself in trouble, but a police officer in uniform out on the street 
[00:40:00]  next to the squad car here, so I, some, they're walking all over me.  I can, I can just see myself getting fired tomorrow.  Yeah.  All right.  But, uh, hey, you guys are great.  Thank you.  Take care of yourself.  Thank you, John.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Reverend Al married a white woman?  I don't know about that.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  I don't know.  I, I, I've never seen his wife.  Maybe she's just a fair-skinned black woman.  You never know.  You know.  Uh, there's a, there's a really funny little thing on the mayor in the paper today, too,  Anthony. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, where is it?  We got to play both sides.  We, we messed with Reverend Al a little bit.  We got to mess with Mayor Giuliani.  Actually, we don't, we don't have to, but it's pretty funny.  In the daily news, Mayor Giuliani says he can't get a cab.  Appearing at the annual luncheon for the, uh, Metropolitan Opera, uh, the Senate candidate  joked that cabbies are still miffed at his restrictive policies and flip him the bird  when he tries to flag them down.  I couldn't get a taxi driver to take me, uh, his honor said.  You know, you know how you put your finger up to hail a cab? 
[00:41:00]  Well, they put a finger up in response.  Stop.  Please?  Could you stop, please?  Hey, wait, where are you going?  Hey, I'll get you a hack number.  I wonder if the strippers do the same thing to him, too.  Flipping the bird?  Probably.  Wants to, like, you know, catch a quick dance or something.  He, uh, oh, yeah.  Imagine him going into, like, a strip club and, and wanting to, uh, see some, yeah, see some 
[00:41:30]  gay.  Gay.  Why the hell can't they show some bush?  Oh, because of me?  Because of you, yes.  And wipe his, uh, wipe their boobs all over his big bald head, his big beluga whale head,  with the sonar equipment in his, in his skull.  His Simon Barsinister head.  He looks so much like Simon Barsinister on the cover of the post.  Look at his picture.  Let me see.  Oh, yeah.  Because he's got, he's got the weird teeth happening.  He's got a lip going up with my weather machine. 
[00:42:00]  I'll rule the world.  Man, Giuliani.  He's a mess, man.  But he can't get a cab?  That's funny.  That's really funny.  Good.  He puts the finger off.  He tries to get his little cab, and they, they flip him the bird.  And what was he trying to get a cab for?  Like, he doesn't have a car at his beck and call every two seconds?  Like, he could get a, he has those, those cars that blow the red lights and everything.  He wants to act like a regular citizen, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Maybe a regular black citizen not being able to get a cab. 
[00:42:30]  All of a sudden, he felt black.  He finally knew some of the pain of being a black man.  Trying to get a cab.  No one can get a cab at seven.  Come on.  Pull over, please.  I've got to take a leak.  I'm getting the dump sweats.  The dump sweats.  We learned something new already today.  Someone's going to bring that up later on in the show.  You get the dump sweats.  The dump sweats.  All right, Amp.  You get that when you're percolating.  You know, and your stomach's like, oh, no. 
[00:43:00]  I'm not going to make it to the can.  Oh, no.  We were discussing dumping with the reporter from the Fox News station, man.  That hot piece of ass we met at that press conference.  Yeah, she's like this hot Fox News chick, you know, at the press conference before we got to the Evo.  And she's a big fan of the show.  Yeah, fan of the show.  And she turns around.  She goes, oh, you Opie and Anthony?  I'm like, yeah. 
[00:43:30]  She goes, oh, I love that whole thing with ass hickey.  With getting, like, butt hickey when you're on the bowl too long.  Like, look at this hot chick thinking about her on the bowl now.  Yeah, she says she gets her best ideas when she's on the bowl.  Yeah, so you sit there for a while, I'm thinking, and you ever get that ass hickey around your ass from the toilet seat?  It cuts off the circulation, leaves a big ring, and you wind up standing up.  You look like a newborn elk or something.  Your legs don't work.  You just, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Your knees are knocking. 
[00:44:00]  Whoa!  Oh, Jesus.  I've been on the bowl for quite a while here.  Oh, my legs are a little tingly.  Let me just get up.  Geez.  Oh, I fell right off.  Okay, terrific.  I love that new one.  Come on, give it to me.  Come on, one time.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  All right, we have to take a break, Anthony. 
[00:44:30]  Okay, terrific.  That makes me crack up.  I love it.  What other ones you got over there before you do the okay, terrific?  Okay, terrific.  We never got out of the junior high, I'm telling you now.  I know. 
[00:45:00]  Okay, terrific.  I believe you'll be hearing that one a lot in the near future.  Put your pants down.  Put your pants down.  Okay, terrific.  All right, easy.  Easy killer.  It's FU Friday.  A lot of people on hold.  We'll get to you next if you want in on the show today.  All right, 212-757-1027.  We have Meadow coming in from The Sopranos in a little while.  Yes.  Not a bad week as far as celebrities go.  No, not at all. 
[00:45:30]  We had Jay Moore.  Big fan of that show.  We had Ivory from the WWF.  We had Tom Green on this week.  And now Meadow from The Sopranos in a little while.  Very, very good.  All right?  Cool.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Is this the best radio you guys can come off with?  1027-WNEW.  Hey, kids.  It's your old pal, Krusty.  And if I wasn't blackmailed into a lifetime contract with Itchy and Scratchy,  I'd have Opie and Anthony on my show. 
[00:46:00]  Syndication now.  It's 1027-WNEW.  It's The Opie and Anthony Show.  I'm trying to find the Cosby story, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They were all over the Cosby story yesterday.  I guess they.  But I guess in the paper today, there's a new Bill Cosby stamp.  There's a picture of the Cos and Felicia Rashad, 
[00:46:30]  who played the wife Claire Uxtable on The Cosby Show.  In the 80s, the U.S. Postal Service has put out a stamp commemorating the Cosby show.  Fulfill, fire and flow.  So that means everyone could lick the Cos.  Everyone can now lick the Cos without the Cos getting in trouble, you see.  I see. 
[00:47:00]  Because as you remember yesterday, a girl claims I tried to grab her hand  and stick it down the Cos' pants.  To play What's in the Cos' Pants.  What's in the Cos' Pants.  Right.  Looks like a snake peeking its head out of a pool rack full of Afro hair.  White Afro hair.  I've got a little gray.  Featherfly.  Yes.  The interesting thing about the Cosby stamp is that the Cos himself makes his own adhesive for the stamp, you see. 
[00:47:30]  The continuous line of 20-year-old girls putting their hands down the Cos' Pants.  Girl, stickier than Jell-O puttin' down there.  Yeah, filth-floor and filth.  Stamp shows the living room of the Huxtable House.  Well, they fit a lot of stuff on this little stamp, huh?  It's the entire living room of the Huxtable House. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  The couch where little Rudy sat with her little mustache.  The stairway that Theo would come down and I'd teach them about how to get girls to put their hands down your pants like your father.  Feels good, though, gooey, wickety, wickety-do.  Felt the floor.  Suck my Huxtable.  All right. 
[00:48:30]  On the stamp, I've got the couch.  Remember the memorable couch of the Cosby Show where I first sat with Felicia Rashad as we was kissing?  And I whipped it out and just said, hey, what are we going to do about this?  Jay Moore joke from yesterday.  Girl, far and filth from far.  That's a good callback from yesterday, Cosby.  What are we going to do about this?  Filth. 
[00:49:00]  So are you denying these charges there, Mr. Cosby?  Deny, deny, deny all the charges from the 20-year-old Chippy that said, I tried to stuff her hand down the front of my pants.  I tried to stuff my hand down the front of her pants.  She goes down there, big pool rack for an apple here and her, too.  Yeah.  More filth.  Young actresses say the darndest things, huh? 
[00:49:30]  She wanted to touch Fat Albert.  That's what I call them, down in my pants, Fat Albert.  Girl, filth from far.  Big and fat like a tuna can.  Hey, Cos, you're just not getting it with your wife Camille anymore, or what?  You have to...  My wife Camille...  Yeah.  ...couldn't get wet in the rainforest.  The Cos is 60 years old, and so is Camille.  Yeah.  And the Cos needs something a little younger.  Well, what's the problem with Camille when she's naked? 
[00:50:00]  Oh, my God, that's not even funny.  Filth and flarn and filth.  Flarn.  It's disgusting.  It's disgusting.  It's dry, dry, dry.  Big camel toe.  She got a big...  Look, here it is.  Hello?  Hey, Camille.  Look, I'll give you a tour of Camille's game.  Hello?  Look, it's little Rudy.  Here comes little Rudy. 
[00:50:30]  There's Theo.  And the other kids, I can't remember their names.  I don't know.  Filth.  Flarn.  And here, here, here comes Fat Albert.  And the Cos became...  ...running out of Camille's big game.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  That was the Cosby's bonus. 
[00:51:00]  And I'm going to sing a song for you.  Now put your head down the Cosby's pants.  Girl.  Girl.  Girl.  Girl has gotten out with me.  So, it's going to be a new Cosby stamp.  Yeah.  Seems that way.  Seems that way.  Ow.  Lick my stamp.  I think I just broke a tooth. 
[00:51:30]  Oh.  That's a little episode where I bit down on some.  Okay.  Terrific.  Very good.  All right.  Looking forward to licking the Cosby stamp.  Licking the Cos.  Lick the Cos.  Put it on your letter.  Touch my penis.  There you go.  You see.  All right.  I would like to talk to you about my penis. 
[00:52:00]  All right, Dan.  We've got to take another break.  This is the last day.  We're featuring tracks from the Brian Regan CD.  He's coming in soon.  I want to turn you on to something that we really enjoy.  These are funny gentlemen who's never touched the Cos's penis.  And here you go.  We'll be back in a few.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of pussies.  God, I want to punch you in the face. 
[00:52:30]  That'll leave a bruise.  1027 WNEW.  It's FU Friday.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for listening to us once again today.  We appreciate it.  And by the looks of the latest ratings trend, it looks like a lot of you guys are listening.  Thank you very much.  We appreciate that.  We appreciate your support.  Yes.  How wonderful.  Radio Chick had a little bump in the ratings trend, too.  Anthony.  Yeah, a little tick up there.  It's nice to see another show here on NEW. 
[00:53:00]  Going up.  Starting to show some signs that there might be some life here at NEW.  Oh, it's still early to tell.  Trust me.  We understand that.  But all I know is, and this is the God's honest truth, driving home last night, listening to Don and Mike, get to the house, shut the car off.  I had to stay in the car.  Whoa!  And that is something I don't think I've ever done, at this station at least. 
[00:53:30]  You know?  Driving home, went to shut the car off, had to listen to see what they were finishing up with.  Very good.  Very funny guys, Don and Mike.  Yeah, Don and Mike are like you and I, plus ten years.  Yeah.  It's like us, if we were maybe a little more organized.  You know?  How true you are.  Maybe in time.  In time.  We just like the format of this show.  It's like, yeah, it goes anywhere.  Who the hell knows?  Some days, you know, we're a laugh riot, and other days we just flat out suck. 
[00:54:00]  We know it.  Oh, well.  But you guys support us.  You stick with us through those ruts, and we're like a retarded friend.  You know?  It's like, oh, he had his good days.  He has his good days.  Where he's not banging his head on the wall.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  That's like a bad day.  But then there's the days it's like, I got the McDonald's with you.  And it's like, oh, okay.  And you take a McDonald's, you have a tender moment with your retarded friend. 
[00:54:30]  And then there's the days banging his head on the wall.  Ah!  Ah!  I'm a con dog.  But even the bad days are entertaining.  Well, even the bad days, you realize that they are special.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No one quite like him.  We're waiting for the former president of the United States of America to call in.  We've got to talk to him today.  There's an interesting story in the paper.  We'll get him on in a few minutes here. 
[00:55:00]  But first, Andrew.  Andrew, what's going on?  Hillary Clinton came to my school today.  Did she?  Hillary came to your school today?  Which school was that?  Robert E. Bell Middle School in Chappuja.  In Chappuja?  It was Citizenship Day.  You live up there where she lives, huh?  Yeah.  Actually, I live in Briarcliff.  That's got to be fun.  What grade are you in?  I'm in eighth.  Eighth grade.  What stupid speech did she give you today?  She was saying something about how fortunate we are to be in the U.S. and to be citizens.  Wow, that's a stretch. 
[00:55:30]  I thought she was going to say how fortunate you guys are to live in Chappuja.  Yeah.  Dude, how fat are her legs?  She was wearing pants.  Of course she was wearing pants.  She wears the pants in the family.  And I really couldn't see.  Yeah.  That's got to be really nice.  You know, Clinton loves women.  He loves to F.  He loves getting BJs.  He loves fondling women.  And look at what he's married to.  The most masculine, unfeminine, pants-wearing, suit-wearing dyke that you can imagine. 
[00:56:00]  It's got to be torture for this guy.  Torture.  Please, somehow, get Clinton back in the White House another four years, at least.  I'm going to miss that bastard.  Yeah.  Well, did you take something away from the Hillary visit there, Andrew?  We were thinking, me and some of my friends were thinking of Channing Rudy, but the cops  were, like, staring at us.  Yeah.  Well, it's a free country here.  Free speech and all.  You guys could have yelled Rudy if you like. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, but they might have gotten detention.  Imagine that.  What are you in for?  I yelled Rudy at the first lady.  You should have said, show us your fun bags.  Might as well go the distance and get detention, you know?  All right, Andrew.  She didn't give you a speech on guns or anything?  She gave you the gun speech?  No.  No?  Yeah, she already forgot about that one.  Oh, yeah.  On to the next thing.  She went to that little school and she's like, children, don't touch guns.  If you ever see them, don't touch them. 
[00:57:00]  You will promise me.  Shut up.  What a campaign ploy.  She could have did the same speech saying, don't touch penis.  Yeah.  Get all the little girls in the room.  Just think of me.  Yeah.  All right, Andrew.  All right, you two guys are awesome.  Hey, guys.  Thank you.  All right, see you.  Thank you.  We've got to move on to Dawn.  Dawn, what's going on?  You're next on WNAW.  Hey, guys.  What are you doing?  Talking to you.  I was wondering if you guys might be able to help me out. 
[00:57:30]  Okay.  I'm here at my boyfriend's house right now.  He's at work and he should be home pretty soon.  Yeah.  And what I wanted to do for him was surprise him with a really great night of sex, but also  to do anal.  You're taking the big step, huh?  Well, we tried it once and it was a little bit painful for me.  And I didn't know if you guys had any tips that maybe you've used in the past that maybe  I could let him know, because he's probably listening right now, or maybe you might be  able to...  You've tried it before? 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, it didn't really work out the entire way.  What was the problem?  It hurt.  Okay, terrific.  It hurt.  Yeah, it just wasn't as...  I just didn't know if there was just some way that you guys knew of just, like, making  it feel a little bit better.  I know it's going to hurt.  Well, are you lubricating or anything?  Yeah, we use that, but I have a lot myself, so...  Yeah, see, that's, you know...  I think you've got to work yourself up into a froth.  Yeah, I...  Oh, absolutely.  I suggest you drink, like, a gallon of wine. 
[00:58:30]  Any booze?  Is any booze coming into play?  Get some of that cheap box wine.  Oh, of course.  There's always wine here.  The wine in the box.  The $6 box?  Yeah.  Yeah, the expensive one.  And what is he doing?  Is he just kind of climbing a board and going to town?  Well, you know, the whole foreplay business first, but then...  No, I mean, right at the point of, you know, where he's ready to go.  I mean, does he...  Is he gentle?  Yes, he is.  He doesn't just, like, you know, plunge into it or anything. 
[00:59:00]  I mean, have you tried, like, a shoehorn?  Is he a big man?  Bigger than average.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Maybe you just need different lubricants.  Maybe that could help.  You know.  So what happens?  It's just hurting a lot.  Yeah, it was just...  It got to a point where there was just this one part, like, yo, and, you know, then it  was like, okay, I can't do this right now.  Oh, a little resistance?  Yeah.  Maybe you're not relaxing enough.  Maybe you're clenching up.  Yeah, that's why you got to get a little more relaxed, a little more wine. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  You pretty much just got to suck it up.  You're almost there.  You're almost there.  Take the pain!  Take the pain!  And I was wondering, you guys, if I could also maybe play the game.  Which one?  With Sam My Fam.  You know, we played a lot this week.  Yeah, call back like next week.  That's one of our new bits that we don't want to burn out.  Well, is there another game I could play?  Because I was hoping maybe there was some WWF tickets, because I'm a huge fan.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's Can I Fit a Phone in my...  No. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, we don't have wrestling tickets until later on today.  Oh, what time?  I'm not sure.  In about an hour.  Any certificates of Paisanos?  Hey, are you going to be doing the anal before the end of the show?  Um, probably not.  Probably about 7.  Oh, damn.  I know.  He doesn't get out of work until 7.  He'd love to have him on the phone while he tries.  I would do that.  I wouldn't mind it.  So, guys, I...  Billy! 
[01:00:30]  Do you have a bedpost?  No, no bedposts.  Oh, that's too bad.  That would be great, man.  Have you guys seen the video of the bedpost girl?  Okay, guys, I'm ready.  My boyfriend's going to attend right now.  I don't think we should have a problem.  I'm pretty lubricated.  No chance of getting a certificate either?  Well, there's a lot of guys that want to give you advice on how to take it.  Okay. 
[01:01:00]  I don't know.  This could get ugly.  All right, we'll try one and see where it goes, okay?  All right.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, you're on with Dawn.  Hi, Dawn.  Hey, Joe, what's up?  Not bad.  Listen, the only thing, when I introduce my ex-wife to it...  All right, Joe, be careful.  I want as much of this on the radio as possible.  Oh, it's perfect.  All right, go ahead.  No problem.  When I introduce my ex-wife to it, instead of being up on all fours, on your back.  With your legs up. 
[01:01:30]  With your legs way up.  Way up.  Behind my ears?  Oh, if you can.  Like you're hanging meat.  I'm serious.  Yeah?  The ankle penetration's a lot better.  Okay.  I'll keep that in mind.  All right?  Well, thank you, Joe.  Oh, and I, you're the best.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Well, Joe, giving some advice.  Let's see if another guy has some advice here, Anthony.  Let's go to Fred.  Fred, you're on with Dawn.  Hey, Dawn, how are you?  How are you doing all day?  Hey, Fred, keep it between the lines so we can get this on the radio. 
[01:02:00]  Do you have some advice for Dawn?  We're going to do our best here, guys.  Okay.  Now, listen, what I've found is the best way is on all fours for her.  And what you have to get her to do, Dawn, are you listening?  I am.  Okay.  So what you have to do is you've got to get all worked up for this.  And then when you reach the point when you guys are going to initiate the act, you have  to keep on going.  You have to keep on touching yourself down there.  Do you follow what I'm saying here?  Yep.  Okay.  Because that's going to kind of take your mind off of it. 
[01:02:30]  Is that possible?  Okay.  It's going to keep you going.  You're not going to mind.  It's going to make you puke.  You're welcome.  All right, Fred.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, look, Dawn's getting all sorts of advice from our best friend, Anthony.  And you thought it was going to be so bad.  I want another lady to give you advice, though.  I mean, the guy advice thing.  I don't know if it's working as well.  Just lay there.  Hey, Steve, what's up? 
[01:03:00]  Steve?  Hey, what's going on, man?  You're on with Dawn.  Hey, Dawn, I agree with both of those guys.  That's right.  And you can't have it all like you've got to be worked up, and you've really got to be  into it.  You know what I'm saying?  Mm-hmm.  And I tell you, the best lubrication is like spit your saliva.  You can't say that, Steve.  All right, all right.  If you're having oral sex, it works out a lot better.  And you've really got to just keep it going.  You know, keep yourself into it.  All right.  Thank you, Steve. 
[01:03:30]  All right, man.  Oh.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Didn't know Sammy was into that.  Hey, Frank.  Yo, what's going on, fellas?  What's going on?  I think you've got to be the last caller.  We're in dangerous territory here.  All right, Dawn.  I'm going to be real cool, real careful for you.  All right, this will all stay on the air, I promise.  All right, you're on with Dawn.  What's your name, Dawn?  Dawn, yes.  Dawn, check it out.  There's a product on the market.  No joke.  Swear to God.  It's called Anal Eash. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, I saw that down in the village.  No joke.  It works, Dawn.  Now, I don't know from experience, but what the women told me underneath me, they said it  didn't hurt as much, tell your man to take it slow and easy.  All right.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  That was a beautiful weekend.  Hey, can I get an F you on the MS?  Yeah, go ahead, Frank.  A huge F you to my boss who left early today to go skiing for the weekend in Vermont when  he just got back from a week in Colorado and left me to work late.  All right.  All right. 
[01:04:30]  That's always the case.  Have a great weekend.  Thank you, Frank.  Well, Dawn, what do you think?  I think it's going to go good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, now there's a lady calling that wants to give you advice.  We've got to get one lady on to help you out.  Okay.  Even though I said we would stop this, but Vicki.  Yeah?  You've got some advice for Dawn.  Yes, I do.  Okay.  Dawn?  Hey, Vic.  Hi, how are you doing?  I'm good.  Those guys are giving you some bad advice.  Some of it's good, some of it's bad.  That up in the air, legs up in the air thing, no, that hurts. 
[01:05:00]  No?  Very painful.  That's no good.  As far as, you know, keeping the pleasuring with the finger going, that's good.  Okay.  That works.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  The easiest way is...  Yes, Danny.  Sit down, Danny.  Lots of lubrication.  Yes.  Turn on your side.  Mm-hmm.  No.  How about a butt plug?  No.  Okay.  I don't think that would work.  Danny?  Okay. 
[01:05:30]  Turn on your side.  Okay.  And that is what I've found to be about the most enjoyable for you.  Some of the other ways can be incredibly painful.  All right.  Mary, Mary, can I give you anal sex?  Please, please, please.  Mary, Mary, I need anal, Mary.  I bet you did that.  I've already asked Mer.  And Lou, Lou, Lou won't give me anal.  I'm leaving.  Okay.  Bye.  Thank you, Nicky. 
[01:06:00]  How about I just bend over Spauldy?  Holly, what's up?  Hi, how you doing?  How are you?  Good.  You guys are great.  Hey, thank you.  Yeah.  I want to give Dawn some advice about the anal ease.  Yes.  Okay.  Great stuff.  Yeah?  The only way I can take it.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Let me tell you.  You know, you see these girls take it in the movies and stuff and you're like, there's no  way.  But, yeah, you get it with the anal ease and you're taking it like a pro. 
[01:06:30]  Okay.  Terrific.  I've got to pick that up.  You can pick that up.  An al ease.  An al ease, yeah.  Wow, popular item.  It is.  It's great stuff.  Yeah, they have a whole bunch of it done.  I think it's a little better if the girl goes in and makes the purchase, though.  I'll tell you the truth.  I need anal ease, please.  Mr. Farmer says, can I get some anal ease, please?  It's for me, Murray, and Lou.  I wonder if they have fisties. 
[01:07:00]  Sorry.  Just have him put a little bit on his finger and like...  All right.  We know how to apply it.  A little on the digit.  No, because if you put it on the guy...  All right, all right, all right.  All right, thank you.  What?  Yeah, if you put it on the guy, it'll numb him.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, you don't want that.  Oh, is it like a numbing agent, too, and a lubricant?  That's what you want.  Yeah, that's what you want in lovemaking.  Something that'll numb the pain.  Kind of like novocate.  I know that the fuel blow to lubricate. 
[01:07:30]  That's what you want.  And then once you're there and actually in the act of anal sex,  I know there's some kidney punches usually make her clinch up, and it feels good.  And not as after press charges if you punch them hard.  So remember, anal tips, drink a lot, don't fight back, bite the pillow, and bleed a lot.  All right.  Thank you, Mike Tyson.  Yeah, if you will. 
[01:08:00]  All right, Holly, thank you.  Thanks, Holly.  Good luck, Don.  Thank you so much.  All right, bye.  Good luck.  Wishing each other well in the wonderful world of anal.  It's like a Novocaine for the butt.  Yeah.  I wonder if you get like, you know when you go to the dentist and your lips get all numb and droopy?  Same thing, it's just a different type of drilling.  Go ahead, rinse.  Valerie, what's going on? 
[01:08:30]  Dawn has to lay on her stomach.  On her stomach.  Now, you guys have all suggested lay on the stomach, lay on the back, lay on the side.  Do it all fours.  Not on all fours.  She's got a first lay on her stomach, so it's completely in.  Then get on all fours.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, there's a move when it's a...  That's wonderful.  Yeah, because it's easier to go in when you're on your stomach, and you enjoy it more when you're on all fours. 
[01:09:00]  All right.  Thank you, Valerie.  Thanks.  Okay.  I think we'll do one more.  Michelle, the area's basted in a lot of rubricans.  That's how I like my anal.  Michelle is pretty.  Take a turkey baster.  And just marinaud the area.  Be sure it's properly marinaud the leather Cheerio.  And lay on your stomach, gals, like a big turkey.  And then get stuffed like a holiday turkey as you baste the area of the leather Cheerio in lubricants. 
[01:09:30]  Marinaud.  And then take the stuffing made of hot beef.  Stuff that turkey.  Just stuff the big, fat turkey.  That's well lubricated with a lubricant marinaud. 
[01:10:00]  Bon appetit with your anal.  Bon appetit.  That's right.  Only a properly lubricated marinaud and balloon knob will be pleasurable to all the people.  Look at the way I enjoy it with my big, fat, old ass.  It's usually best served with a tossed salad.  Hey, Karen, you guys.  There's a fine wine.  Fine wine, my mom loosens the area up. 
[01:10:30]  Bon appetit.  Okay, terrific.  Let me talk.  Bye, guys.  Hey, Karen, you guys have advice for Dawn?  Yeah, actually, you should just get KY Jelly from the drugstore.  KY.  Yeah.  That works the fastest.  KY.  KY.  And to be on all of this.  KY Jelly or KY Jam.  And honestly, if you could just get her boyfriend hooked up, it'll be so quick. 
[01:11:00]  Pick it painless is how I like it.  Okay.  Take a deep breath and it'll be over so fast.  All right.  Thank you, Karen.  You're welcome.  Bye.  Proper lubricant.  We'll have something in a chicken base.  Or maybe some jam.  All right, Jody.  Strawberry preserve.  Hey, what's up, Jody?  How are you guys?  Very good.  All right, so I want to give some advice for you.  Okay, go.  You have to lay completely flat on your stomach. 
[01:11:30]  Mm-hmm.  And stick your butt up in the air.  And actually push.  Listen, listen.  Listen, we had to dump out of that.  You can't say that.  That's a sound advice.  Maybe Julia Child could, like, uh...  We understand that sound advice.  Julia Child, could you translate what didn't make it up?  Yes, let's say you're stuffing a holiday turkey. 
[01:12:00]  It would help if the turkey felt like it was to push the stuffing back out.  Push.  And remember, plenty of more and on.  The only way it works is with more and on.  I know I used to enjoy anal a lot more, but the men seem to roll off of my hunchback these days.  You see my boobs?  Sweat socks full of sand. 
[01:12:30]  Well, I didn't know how else to put it.  That's okay, Joni.  Thank you.  All right.  Good luck, Dylan.  Bon appétit!  All right.  This is too funny.  Someone on the instant feedback is suggesting that we get Charlton Heston in here to explain it.  Explain it?  I don't know.  I think Charlton Heston is under the weather this week.  That old gag.  Melanie, what's up? 
[01:13:00]  Hi.  I love you guys, really.  I just started listening a little while ago, but you guys are the best.  Hey, thank you.  I actually just wanted to advise her.  Astroglide is the thing to use.  Astroglide?  What the hell is that?  That's the best.  Is that a type of lubricant?  Yes.  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, okay.  It's, like, the best.  All right.  Wow.  And you've got to position, she's just got to, like, maneuver her body a certain way.  It's just, it's weird, but.  Like a big holiday ham.  Make her body look like a giant holiday ham. 
[01:13:30]  And you're ready to blaze it.  Blaze it.  Make a little target with a slice of pineapple, perhaps.  Right around the leather Cheerio with plenty of more in the heart.  You know how you poke the holiday ham with cloves and cherries?  Just put a big slice of pineapple right around the leather Cheerio.  Drive away, stuff away.  Make a big stuffed pork jump. 
[01:14:00]  But the most important thing is the more in the heart.  Now, guys.  Guys.  Yeah.  The most important thing is to have you go real slow.  Okay.  If it goes in too fast, it'll kill her.  Slow and steady, Windsor.  All right.  Thanks.  Thank you, Melanie.  All right.  Bye-bye.  It won't let you cook a holiday ticket very slowly.  You know, it wouldn't be good if you just used a whole fist and jubbed the stuffing in.  Oh, God.  No, thanks.  I got the sickest visual in my head right now. 
[01:14:30]  Julian Child loves anal.  Can you imagine what that looks like?  It looks just like one of those red-ass monkeys.  My balloon nut.  My 85-year-old balloon nut.  Oh, look.  I'm making my own morning dog.  No, Julia.  You're making your own brown sauce.  No.  Brown sauce.  It's almost real.  It's almost real.  Oh, my goodness. 
[01:15:00]  Okay.  Terrific.  Oh, boy.  Well, Dawn, I guess you're on your own at this point.  Okay.  We really encourage you to call in.  We hope it happens before 7 o'clock tonight.  We want to see if any of this advice worked.  Have fun with it.  Any chance of getting a gift certificate for Paisanos for all this public?  Let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something, and you can't fake it.  You call back.  Okay.  You're naked.  You're in bed.  Your guy's ready. 
[01:15:30]  And you call in and go, okay, fellas, I'm going in.  Then we'll give you the Paisano gift certificate.  Okay.  Let's get home from work early, then.  We want you to call just before it happens.  Okay.  All right?  Thanks, guys.  All right.  There she goes, everyone.  Dawn.  Thanks.  You guys are awesome.  Wait.  There's a nurse that wants to give you advice.  All right.  One more.  One more.  Grease the pen so it doesn't stick.  Plenty of grease.  Hello?  Rita.  Yes.  You're a nurse?  Yes, I am. 
[01:16:00]  I'm an experienced nurse.  All right.  All right.  A serious nurse with an unserious phone.  Huh?  Your phone's really bad.  Okay.  Can you hear me now?  It's kind of bad.  Oh, okay.  I guess I'm cutting it out.  Yeah.  Call back.  I've got a cell phone.  That's a problem.  All right.  Yeah.  Sorry, Rita.  Your phone's really bad.  All right, Dawn.  So give us a call back, okay?  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Matter of fact, for being a good sport, do we have Paisano gift certificates?  All right.  Hold on a line.  We'll give you one.  But still call us back later, okay?  All right, guys.  You got it.  Spaz, we'll be taking care of you on the phone lines.  Thank you so much.  There she goes. 
[01:16:30]  Dawn, we were supposed to get a phone call from Mr. Reagan.  Yeah.  But Julia Child stopped by.  So what we'll do is we'll take a break, and hopefully we'll have Reagan on the phone next,  okay?  Cool.  Stay there.  Train, rent, and rent.  What's that, a train?  What's that, a train?  What's that, a train?  Oh, P. and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Uh, Steve from Jersey.  Can we please play Make Meadow Cry? 
[01:17:00]  And what's in Meadow's pants?  Oh, my God.  The girl's a TV star.  Making her cry should be easy.  She gained...  Oh, all right.  Uh, never mind.  Uh, okay.  Good.  All right, Steve.  You can ask for yourself when you, uh, when she gets in here.  Meadow from Sopranos.  Meadow Soprano coming in.  The actress Jamie Lynn.  Yes.  Okay.  Uh, speaking of, uh, Make Someone Cry, we're in the middle of spots here, but, uh...  Yes.  We're taking your votes for, uh, Bit of the Week, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, it's not too late to get your votes in, but, uh, I don't know. 
[01:17:30]  Make, Make Bridget Cry Part 2 is, uh, is in the lead.  Yeah, people really, uh, seem to like having cruel people.  And right after we talk to, uh, Meadow Soprano, Jamie Lynn.  Yeah, get her real name.  Jamie Lynn.  Jamie Lynn Sigler.  Jamie Lynn Sigler.  I mean, it seems like, uh...  Jamie Lynn Sigler.  It's a character.  You know, she probably has people all the time.  Hey, Meadow.  Hey, Meadow, what's up?  Like, ah, that's not my name.  But after we talk to her, then we'll do Bit of the Week, so get your vote in. 
[01:18:00]  But it's looking like it might be Make Bridget Cry Part 2, Anthony.  Yes.  We're in the middle of spots.  Let's talk about Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Let me be the...  Ah.  ...the one to, once again, congratulate Joey and his wife on, on the birth of their daughter.  Yes.  Christine Nicole Paisano, right?  Paisano.  Well, we don't want to give his real last name out on the air.  No.  Yeah, I guess that's fine.  All right, so it's Christine Nicole Paisano, as far as we're all concerned.  Congratulations, Joey.  Yes.  So if you do go down to Paisano in the very near future and Joey's there, make sure you 
[01:18:30]  congratulate him.  It's a very happy, happy day for him and his family, okay?  I wonder how it is.  And, you know, I know the Italians.  I am one myself.  And, of course, having a daughter instead of the son, I wonder if that's an issue with  Joey and the family.  I wonder if he's wondering, you know, oh, my God.  But, you know, there's a daughter, which is great as long as the child's healthy, but  you do want a boy to take on the, well, the empire.  You know, Joey was one of these guys, you know, way back when we were going to the Yankee 
[01:19:00]  playoff games and stuff.  Yeah.  He wanted to know ahead of time.  There's not many people in this day and age want to know the sex of their baby ahead of  time.  True.  But Joey wanted to know, and he found out early he was going to be a daughter, and  he was ecstatic.  Yeah.  He was very excited, so.  He's going to need a boy at some point to take over the Paisano empire.  You know what I mean?  I know what you mean.  Uh-huh.  I was there last night.  And?  Went to Paisano's.  And I bet you had a horrible time.  What, are you kidding?  It was great.  Yeah. 
[01:19:30]  What did I have last night?  I had veal marsala.  Oh.  Do you have any animal rights activists there screaming and yelling?  Because you're ordering veal?  That's always fun.  That's always fun.  Just the girly.  That's always fun when I'm with Anthony and we're in restaurants and he orders veal.  The people around us get horrified.  Yeah, it's okay.  They're born to be in those little boxes, so they get all tender, so I can eat them.  It was delicious.  Mm-mm. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, it was very good.  And then, of course, the side of spaghetti with the wonderful Paisano sauce.  And started off always with the fried ravioli.  Had an Opie and Anthony fan there come right up to the table, said hi.  Sent over some drinks, which was great.  Appreciate that.  And the atmosphere, fantastic.  Mm-hmm.  I always sit in the same corner table, so no one could see me.  You have to come over and really kind of search me out, Opie. 
[01:20:30]  So they have to kiss your ring?  Yes.  No, actually, I sit right by the front window where the picture of us is.  So people come up, they look at the picture, and they'll look in the window and go, oh, look,  that jerk is here.  Right.  I sit at that same table.  It's the great table, man.  That's the best table in the place.  Sure.  The Opie and Anthony.  They ought to put a sign up there.  Joey.  Joey, put a sign there.  It's the Opie and Anthony table.  Yeah, please do.  Had a great time.  Great food last night at Paisano of Mulberry Street.  We love it.  All right, give them a call, 965-1188. 
[01:21:00]  That's 965-1188.  Don't forget, congratulate Joey.  And if you see him there, tell Joey we sent you, and he'll give you a glass of wine on  the house, okay?  Yes, he will.  It's Paisano of Mulberry Street.  How you doing?  This is Andrew Dice Clay.  I got a lot of personality.  I mean, I got a lot of personality.  Try that one, Anthony.  You're listening to Anthony and Opie on WNEW 102.7.  Bama.  Bama.  Bama.  You're listening to Opie Anthony, because I'm the Dice Man, and I tell you something, 
[01:21:30]  I'm a jerk call.  Okay?  All right?  I cannot wait to get him back in the studio, man.  Yeah.  It's been too long.  Where the hell is the Dice Man?  I've been busy.  I'm touring all over the place.  No, no.  The real Dice.  I'm at a...  Where am I?  Oh, yeah.  I'm booked on Venus.  The second they get a ship to take me, I'm there.  Until then, I'm trying to lay low.  I'm making a cackety-poochee-poochee-poochee-poochee-poochee-poochee-poochee-poochee. 
[01:22:00]  What'd I just say?  What'd I say?  Take a坐ie-poochee-poochee-poochee-poochee-poochee-poochee-poochee-poochee-poochee.  Dave, what's up?  Hey man, I just want to tell you guys first, you guys really suck.  Thank you.  Secondly, I was laughing so hard at that Julia Childs bit that I was in traffic on Route 3.  I rear-ended this lady, and she got out of her car, and I apologized to her,  and she was listening to the exact same thing.  Oh, cool.  That was freaking great.  That's got to be my most favorite one, that and is this a train. 
[01:22:30]  They both qualify.  That's the best, man.  You guys suck.  Say it.  Say it.  I'm in the category of personal.  Take your face, farmer.  Jesus Christ, what's wrong with that guy, man?  I didn't even know what he was saying when he was saying that.  We miss him.  I was talking to Ken yesterday, as a matter of fact.  He's in Vegas, right?  Club Soda. 
[01:23:00]  Club Soda Kenny.  Club Soda Kenny.  What a moron.  What a takeoff.  I'm in the category of personal.  You know, Club Soda Kenny listens to our show just about every day.  Yep.  He should get Dice to call us today.  Yeah, get Dice on the phone.  Get Dice on the phone so he can goof on a little bit.  Come on.  Come on, Club Soda.  Come on, Kenny.  Help us out.  All right.  One more toilet, I'll scrub, and I'll call.  That phone's going to be ringing now. 
[01:23:30]  Man, you want to talk to Meadow?  Jamie Lynn?  Is she here?  Yeah.  Cool.  Screw Reagan.  We'll do Reagan in a little while, man.  Screw Reagan.  Well, Reagan was supposed to call, but Jamie Lynn Sigler.  Sigler.  Meadow Soprano.  It's like a real celebrity.  We're used to Jay Moore and stuff.  It was a celebrity.  Look, it is you.  Oh, look at you.  Oh, my God.  You're a real celebrity.  Oh, my God.  I watch you all the time.  Look, I'm all starstruck.  We love The Sopranos.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, that's so cool. 
[01:24:00]  I can't believe it.  We just want to stare at you.  Yeah, let's just go.  Come on.  No.  Hey, that show doesn't do you justice.  You're beautiful.  Oh, thank you.  Very pretty.  Wait, because I know people are going to jump down my throat.  Not that you're ugly on the show, but in person, you're even more spectacular.  Thank you.  Wow.  Did you hear our last segment?  No.  Oh, thank God.  Oh, no.  How old are you?  I'm 18.  18.  Oh, yeah.  She's of age.  Yeah, we were just given some lovely...  Oh, my God.  It's right up here.  What?  Anal tips are on the page. 
[01:24:30]  Don't look at that.  That's okay.  Oh, my God.  Listen to you, guys.  I know what's up.  Do you?  Do you really listen to us?  My brother got me into you guys, actually.  And what's your brother's name, man?  Brian.  Hey, Brian.  Grandma Mike.  We don't care who's on the radio with us.  What's up, boys?  You don't have to be an actor or an actress to be on the show.  We brought you guys some presents.  Did you really bring beer?  We brought you some beer.  Wow.  Wow, look at that.  I know under the new management, we're allowed to bring it in, so...  Well, that's okay.  I think they left, didn't they?  Yeah, I think they left for the week, so...  Is he gone?  I brought you my favorite stuff.  Get ready?  Oh, peeps.  Peeps. 
[01:25:00]  Peeps.  My sister loves these things.  And, of course, the yellow ones that we really like.  And I brought you a present.  Why?  Why would you?  Open it.  Remember for you?  It is.  Oh, no.  She really listens to the show.  I think that's so freaking cool, man.  Wait a minute.  Uh-oh.  No, wait a minute.  I hope he wants the Ricky Martin poster.  I do not want the Ricky Martin poster.  I'll take a no-doubt poster.  Ricky Martin.  Hey, let's eat some peeps and get really, you know, freaked out here.  Peeps and beer. 
[01:25:30]  That's cool.  Peeps, beer.  I'll crack one of those.  And coffee.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  So your brother turned you on to our show?  Yes, I did.  Are you from, where are you from?  Jersey?  Long Island.  Long Island, where?  Well, what, like, area?  Central.  Central?  All right.  We're Huntington guys.  All right.  That's kind of my neck.  We're Huntington.  Yeah, really?  Yeah.  Cool.  Oh, you still living there?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I'm still at home.  You still live with your parents?  I still live with my parents.  Oh, come on.  You've got to get a house and stuff.  The show's a big hit at this point.  They've got to be paying you more. 
[01:26:00]  You've got to get your own house.  I'm soon, hopefully.  Working on it?  Yeah.  Yeah?  What's your brother, though?  I'm curious.  My brother?  Go ahead.  Tell him.  I work with my dad right now.  Really?  This is so funny.  This is just like, you guys are just a regular Long Island family.  It just so happens that the daughter in the family is on one of the hugest shows ever.  Yeah, she's connected.  People think that, I guess, sometimes.  Ask your mob questions and stuff.  Yeah, they ask me some stupid questions sometimes.  What's some of those stupid questions before we ask them? 
[01:26:30]  Okay.  Dude, you've got to eat some of these peeps, man.  They're the best.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to get a sugar rush.  I got a headache array.  My head is spinning.  I couldn't make a fist if my life depended on it.  Come on.  Yeah, what's some of those stupid questions?  One guy asked me, like, the guys bring guns to the set.  Like something stupid.  Um, do that.  Uh, actually, um, Boy Who Plays My Little Brother told me the other day, um, that someone  stopped him in the street and, like, he's like, oh, are you the kid from the Spiders? 
[01:27:00]  He's like, yeah.  He's like, oh, I love that show.  He's like, thanks.  He's like, can I ask you a question?  He's like, yeah.  He's like, have you ever seen your sister naked?  He's like, what?  Well, see, now, if he was here, we would ask him that question anyway.  Yeah, we would ask him that one.  But now, you started that show when, what, a couple of years ago, I guess?  Yeah, I was 16 in the first episode.  16.  And I was 17 in the second one.  Did the guys feel a little strange throwing the language around that they have to in front  of you or whatever?  Uh, a little, but you know what, like...  You've heard it at home anyway, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Okay.  I have cable TV. 
[01:27:30]  I know what that's like.  Grew up on Long Island.  We all know what that's like.  Yeah.  Parents curse.  It doesn't matter what the hell is going on.  They don't have a problem giving the little kid that line, uh, no effing ZD.  Yeah.  They don't have a problem saying in front of her.  True.  And the guys are all cold-y and everything?  So cool.  Yeah?  They're the best.  Are you getting very protective, I guess?  Very.  Yeah.  Very.  You're getting recognized everywhere now?  Uh, a lot more.  Yeah?  What's like the strangest place you've been recognized?  Um, well, I mean, everywhere.  I mean, the mall.  They follow you around and stuff.  Yeah, the other... 
[01:28:00]  This never happened.  Like, usually the fans are, like, really cool about it, you know?  But the other day, I went to the mall with my friends, and, uh, this guy stopped.  He's like, you have a girlfriend's house?  I'm like, yeah.  He's like, wow.  He's like, why are you here?  Why are you here?  I'm like, what do you mean?  They think, like, everything will get delivered to your house or something.  Don't you have a personal shopper?  I'm like, oh.  You should never, ever go out again.  Yeah.  I'm supposed to.  I don't know.  Just lock you up in a house.  I still have a life.  Yeah.  All right.  Now, we've got to ask about, uh, you know, guys and stuff.  We've got a boyfriend.  Yes, I do. 
[01:28:30]  You do, huh?  Did he buy you that sporty necklace you were wearing over there?  No, he bought me the earrings.  Or did the show buy you that?  Jesus Christ.  You got some diamonds on you, girl.  Oh, thank you.  My dad actually got me that.  Yeah?  Yeah, he got me the matching earrings.  You're making a nice dime on that show, right?  Won't get into details, but I'm sure you can.  I don't really pay attention to that part yet.  I mean, I know.  Really?  Yeah.  Mom and Dad are, like, cashing the checks for you?  Yeah, you're not going to wind up being one of those poor kids that end up with no money.  No, I don't think so.  I trust my parents.  Yeah.  Well, there's a lot of people that want to talk to you.  Okay. 
[01:29:00]  Listeners can be a little rough, you all right?  Yeah, I'm a little nervous, but, yeah, I think I can handle it.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  Oh, some of our listeners can really be bad.  All right.  If you want to talk, give us a call, 212-757-1027.  George, peeps and bass ale.  What's up?  What's up?  We got Jamie Landon here.  What's up?  Metal Soprano.  Jamie, let me ask you a question.  You do listen to the show, am I right?  Oh, no.  I do.  Okay.  Why don't we have Jamie go in the other room and play a little game called Watching 
[01:29:30]  Her Pants?  You are...  I didn't know that was coming.  You are awful.  Did you ever hear that on the show, Jamie?  Yeah, I heard it.  I was just telling her about the...  We were just talking about it.  Yeah, it's an interesting game.  It's our new favorite game.  We're pretty good.  You know Jay Moore?  Yes, I do.  Yeah, he's on our show like all the time.  Yeah.  Like even more than we want him on.  But no, come on.  I'm kidding.  He's such a good friend.  We can talk like that.  No, you're not.  No.  But yeah, he's very good at that game. 
[01:30:00]  I think he's in the lead now.  Really?  Yeah.  We just identify what type of grooming the girl does down there.  You know the show.  Yes, I'm aware.  By rubbing the phone on me.  But dude, she's a big star.  Can't ask big stars to do that.  Well, we didn't even ask her.  Will you do that?  Right.  She has one of the Bada Bing girls.  They'll do that.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, how about that?  You ever see any of those girls dancing and stuff?  No, I'm not around when they do that.  No clips when they're doing that, huh?  No.  You've got to bring them into the show for us.  You know what's weird? 
[01:30:30]  Like watching the show, especially the first season.  You were 16.  Yeah.  Now you're 18 of age, but I still feel very defensive like I'm talking to a girl who's underage.  But for the love of God, she brought us beer and she's 18.  There you go.  Jason, you got a question?  Yeah.  Okay.  No, she used to be my counselor at special home day camp in Roslyn.  Really?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  A counselor?  You used to be a camp counselor?  Yeah, I did that one summer.  Were the kids like in love with you and everything?  Not at all.  No?  No, I was.  Oh. 
[01:31:00]  How old are you, Jason?  14.  14?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I'd hate to think what he's doing to your picture, man.  Jesus Christ.  Well, you've got to know, 14, you're just raging hormones.  You think she's hot, huh, Jay?  Yep.  Yeah.  Oh, thank you.  Does she have any special talents at camp?  Not really.  Not really?  Does she teach anything?  Nope.  No, huh?  I can see this kid.  All right.  I can see this kid on Sunday nights.  Where's my Sopranos baby oil?  Well, come on.  You've got to know. 
[01:31:30]  That's part of this.  The downside of it.  I mean, guys, especially, we're trying to keep it.  No, it's okay.  I'm being above board.  We're being very nice.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, yeah.  I'm driving down Joe Pike.  First of all, Jamie, let's make Jamie cry.  No, we won't play that game.  God, we have some stupid games on this show.  Why do I feel like I know who that was?  Really?  Really?  Sound familiar?  I feel like that was an ex-boyfriend of mine.  Really?  Are they calling now?  I don't know.  Like exes? 
[01:32:00]  Do they try to get in touch with you now and stuff?  No, but why do I feel like that was an ex-boyfriend that I ended up on a bad note with?  There you go.  Could be.  They must be regretting it now.  What's up?  I wanted to ask Jamie how she liked meeting Corky at the elementary school she worked at.  Hi, Ben.  How are you doing, Jamie?  Good.  How are you?  I'm doing pretty good.  What's up, Ryan?  What's going on, Deb?  How are you doing?  You met Corky?  Yes, I did.  Yeah?  I went to...  I met Corky, too.  Everybody met Corky at some point. 
[01:32:30]  He's a nice guy.  He gets around.  He looked her up and down like she was a piece of meat.  It was the funniest thing I've ever seen.  Was Corky taken with you, I guess?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Come on.  Yeah.  I think we have a love connection.  Corky actually sang to all the little kids at the elementary school.  I've never laughed that hard in my entire life.  We have some Corky music.  Yeah, you want to hear a little Corky?  We love it.  We play it here on the show a lot.  Poison Ivy is the best one.  Poison Ivy rolls.  You're kidding.  Listen to this.  It's really Corky.  You've never heard of Corky? 
[01:33:00]  We love playing Corky.  Any excuse to play Corky?  I don't know who the two guys are that he did this with.  Actually, I met one of the guys that he did this with.  Really?  Yeah.  He was there with them.  Oh, look.  Oh, you're going to cry?  No.  Oh, man.  Yeah, right.  Here we go.  Try to guess who's Corky.  I know.  It's a little hard.  Listen a little longer.  I don't know why this didn't take off. 
[01:33:30]  I don't know why this didn't take off. 
[01:34:00]  He's very proud of his music career.  Yeah.  As well as he should be.  Yeah.  And that's got to be great where if you make an accomplishment of any kind, people look and  just go, wow, that's really good.  You know, because, I mean, he's not singing that well, but considering his circumstance, 
[01:34:30]  it's like, wow, that's pretty good.  Meanwhile, when he walks out of the room, they're hysterical laughing at him.  Yeah, I know.  See?  It's a big sham.  It's a mean world.  Spider, you got a question?  Yo, Jamie, how are you doing?  How are you doing?  How are you doing?  I got a question for you.  Do you take it up the balloon nut?  Oh, God.  You know?  Inappropriate question.  Jesus.  I don't think we could go to the phones.  Sometimes our listeners are real a-holes.  Frank wants to know if you get the dump sweats.  What is that? 
[01:35:00]  We just learned that today, earlier.  Somebody called up and said that he was out on a date, and he was on a boat, so we couldn't  like, go to the bathroom, and he started getting the dump sweats, which, I mean, you can only  imagine how bad that would be on a date.  No, I don't get the dump sweats.  She's getting pissed, man.  You have to percolate?  Oh, my God.  Sorry.  You know, the girl's coming here.  You guys have to define what you're saying to me.  That, I think, is before the dump sweats, like, starts bubbling in the stomach, you start 
[01:35:30]  percolating.  Hey, she's a big star.  You don't, like, ask her these stupid questions.  We did some research on you.  We rarely do research on our guests, but we did.  It says you recently saw The Godfather, finally?  Yeah, I did, actually.  Yeah?  What's your favorite scene?  We love The Godfather.  My favorite scene?  Yeah.  I felt really bad when, I think his name was Sonny, got killed at, like, that...  Oh, the toll booth?  Yeah.  That was pretty good.  He would have lived if he had Easy Pass. 
[01:36:00]  That's right.  That's a good commercial for Easy Pass.  Yeah, really?  Sonny would have made it.  Yeah.  Boy, guy.  Wow, I just saw that.  I keep forgetting what age she is.  Yeah, we saw that about 20 years ago.  We saw it in the movie theater.  Right.  Nah, that's not good.  Actually, I just started seeing those movies just because of Sopranos, because everyone  asked me about those.  I'm like, I don't know.  Yeah.  Maybe I should do a little research for myself, yeah. 
[01:36:30]  Got anything else you're working on?  Like, you must be offered a lot of parts and stuff.  I'm supposed to be starting in Les Mis soon.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Wow, cool.  Because I've done, like, a lot of theater.  Sopranos was really, like, my first, like, film.  Singing and stuff.  Yeah.  Dancing.  All that stuff.  Really?  Yeah.  So, have the office come flooding in from Playboy and Penthouse and stuff?  None of those yet.  No, not yet?  It's just a better time.  Look at the face he makes.  No, don't.  Believe me, they will start coming in.  And then you'll laugh and go, oh, those guys were right.  I think your agent's probably shielding you from them. 
[01:37:00]  I think so.  The agent's probably getting the, uh.  All right, we'll try the phones again here.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys doing today?  Good.  You got a question for Jamie?  Yeah, I do.  Actually, I'm just curious.  I wonder who has less hair, Little Steven Ted or Herb Beaver?  Yeah, yeah.  Now, that's not what it said on the screen, Jamie.  Jesus Christ.  Well, I don't see his hair.  He wears a wig or he wears his bandana, so I couldn't tell you that, all right?  Triangle of my hook. 
[01:37:30]  Well, we have to ask.  All right.  You don't want to discuss anything like that?  Nothing like that, no.  I wouldn't either.  That was horrible.  I read that on an email.  It wasn't me that asked.  My dad's listening.  Oh, my God, really?  He'll kick your ass, Anthony.  He's nervous.  Oh, really?  He's nervous for having you come on the show.  Does he know what this show's all about?  When did he listen to it?  Yesterday?  Oh, no.  Yesterday was...  That's not a good day.  What's in her pants?  Oh, no.  Come on.  No, my dad's a cool guy. 
[01:38:00]  It's okay.  Yeah, he has a pretty loose and stuff?  Yeah, they're cool.  He's only on his right here, right?  How old is your dad?  My dad is 52, but he looks like he's, like, 32.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Acts young and stuff.  Yeah, he's cool.  That's cool.  Is he connected?  Not at all.  We're Jewish.  Yeah.  We're Jewish.  Jewish and Italians in movies are always interchangeable.  They do that a lot.  Yeah.  Everybody else is...  I think I'm, like, the only one that's not Italian.  Yeah, everybody else is Italian on the show, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, all thrown around. 
[01:38:30]  Do they all speak it around the...  Not...  No.  No?  No.  Try to keep things behind your back.  Yeah, but they reminisce about, like, their family and stuff.  I can't relate at all.  Really?  No.  No.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Do you want to hang for a little while or are you scared?  Sure.  We'll give you a chance...  Don't get scared away.  We'll give you a chance to run if you want.  No, it's all right.  We were on the way like Bridget yesterday or the other day.  She ran out of his open.  Every once in a while we have girls running out of this studio crying.  I don't know why, but...  Besides, I've got to eat a few more of these peeps. 
[01:39:00]  I want to have a bath.  I wish I brought you more.  Oh, no.  No, I already got a sugar headache.  All right, we'll be back.  Stay there.  Oh, hey.  I'm a sex star.  Yeah, sure.  It's the truth.  I'm a sex star.  You can measure up to the point stars out.  Yeah.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  It's like a little naughty O.P.  He screws everybody.  I'm a sex star.  We love to see you.  He's an excellent physical specimen.  I thought gagging?  Yeah, sure.  It's the truth.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:39:30]  A panther I'll stick.  Oh, my God.  I'm getting titillated.  O.P. and Anthony.  This is stupid.  Somebody's got to get laid.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  1-8-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Being Anthony there in my day, radio was boring all the time.  And we liked it that way.  Tell that dirty Sanchez guy to take a bath.  10-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Anthony doing his spaz impression for Jamie Lynn.  He was all taken. 
[01:40:00]  And Jamie's brother in the studio.  Of course, Meadow Soprano on The Sopranos.  Yes.  They call you Meadow all the time.  All the time.  Yeah.  It's all right.  Do you like that name, Meadow?  It is.  The name's a little different.  It is.  Well, supposedly, I'm not sure, but supposedly she got the name because she was conceived in  the Meadowlands in, like, a car or something.  That's pretty good.  That is good.  Because, you know, they're pretty...  After a mob hit, you know?  They're pretty rich on their culture and everything. 
[01:40:30]  Like, we're sticking with the Italian, and Meadow's just not Italian.  Not at all.  We also found out that her mom's listening right now, we believe.  Yeah.  She might be.  I don't know.  The dad's definitely listening.  They were a little worried having her come on this video show today.  It's okay.  It's okay.  We've been nice so far, right?  I'm a good girl.  You can have it.  Yeah.  You're just tempting our listeners.  Don't even say that.  Hey, Matt, you got a question?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  I want to ask Jamie what her favorite Sopranos episode she ever did was. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, okay.  A real question.  A real question.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  Who dodged a bullet, finally?  I have to say the first season when I went to visit colleges.  That was great.  You know, when I asked him if he's in the mob.  Because it was just like a whole week of hanging out with James, and he's probably one of the coolest people you like to meet.  Yeah.  Yeah, and so I had a lot of fun with him.  So it was that one.  Cool.  Yeah, we got to get him on the show.  Thank you, Matt.  He'd be a fun guy.  He's so much fun.  I expect him to come through the door.  So we'd get a little off with you or something, you know. 
[01:41:30]  What are you doing to my daughter?  Probably Tony Serico first.  Yeah.  This studio's never smelled better, by the way.  Yes.  Oh, thank you.  No, I'm serious.  It's usually just a bunch of guys sweating and burping and farting.  It's kind of embarrassing, but.  It's horrible.  Camillo from New High Park on the island.  O&A.  What's up, guys?  I have a question for Meadow.  Are you learning Italian on the set with all those guys around?  Any words or phrases you've picked up while shooting scenes?  Thank you.  You're hot.  You're great on the show.  Thank you. 
[01:42:00]  Any good phrases?  Can you, like, curse in Italian or anything?  Like, ba and, like.  Yeah.  Bafangul.  Yeah.  You know.  Did you watch the last weekend?  The last episode that just aired?  I missed the last one.  Same with me.  Oh, you.  I swear.  I missed.  And I was like, I better watch this because she's coming in.  There's a good scene where Michael Imperioli plays Christopher, my cousin, goes to a movie  set.  Oh, no.  That scene I saw.  Oh, you saw that?  Yeah.  With Garofalo and.  Yeah.  Book Yak. 
[01:42:30]  That's what he said to say.  Yeah.  There you go.  Have you learned how you doing?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you hear that all the time.  How you doing?  Got any stalkers or anything?  Any wacky fan mail that kind of frighten you?  I'm starting to get mailed in my house, which is a little weird.  I don't know how people are getting my address.  Somebody said that's like, it's all over the internet.  Like, somebody just called my name and got my number.  Any of those fake naked pictures of you on the internet yet?  You come across those?  Do they take your head and plop it on their body?  I don't think I'm that important for anyone to do.  I don't know, man. 
[01:43:00]  It's just a matter of time.  It is just a matter of time.  It's sad.  But they're so obviously fake, too, like when they plop a head on someone's body.  Obviously, of course.  Yeah.  Well, we were on our way in here, and my beeper went off, and there's this weird number,  and I called back, and this kid's like, yeah, do you remember me?  I'm like, well, who are you?  He's like, my name's Brian.  I met you at a party two months ago, and you gave me your number.  I'm like, I really don't think I would give you my number.  I'm like, what party? 
[01:43:30]  He's like, I don't know.  I'm like, well, how old is he?  He's like, 16.  I'm like, I don't think I gave you my number.  I'm like, first of all, I'm like, was my boyfriend with me at the party?  He's like, yeah, it was right there.  I'm like, okay.  I gave you my number.  My boyfriend's standing next to me at some party.  She's 18, man.  It's all right.  You've got to deal with the same crap.  He's like, call me later.  Hey, Dan, what's going on?  What the...  Hey, how you doing, Jane?  Hi, how are you?  Pretty good. 
[01:44:00]  I just wanted to say, first off, compliment you on your acting.  I think you really play it really well.  Thank you.  You don't overact like a lot of you kids do.  Thank you.  And you seem like a really cool girl, so I wish you luck.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, she's real cool.  She brought us beer and little peeps, marshmallow peeps.  I love that show, and I liked her a lot, and I was just worried she was going to be not cool at all,  and you guys were just going to end up ripping her, but it's cool.  No, she's very cool.  Oh, thank you so much.  We only rip the people we don't like.  I just wanted to know if, like, some info on the love coming shows and stuff.  Is David Chase going to work in your weight gain into, like, some episode on bulimia? 
[01:44:30]  Um, no, you know, it's not so much an issue with the show, but actually, I mean, people have been cruel about it.  I'm not trying to be cruel.  Thank you.  I really understand.  I was just wondering because, like, I mean, it seems like it's such a cool show that they do something like that.  Like, they'd have you put on some weight in the...  No, actually, when we did the first episode, I had gotten over an eating disorder, and I'm, like, very open about it, 
[01:45:00]  and I'm, like, trying to become, like, active with organizations that involve, like, you know, talking to girls, you know,  with bulimia and anorexia and stuff like that.  So it's not that important to them.  All right.  So they're not talking about it.  Wow.  Bastard tried to sneak that in, didn't he?  If he talks you all up and compliments you and then slips that one in.  It's all right.  You sure?  I'm sure.  Okay.  Wow, that hit me hard.  It's like, oh, and a punch-up. 
[01:45:30]  So I said, don't you worry, you still got a fine ass.  Thank you.  Don't you worry.  You sweat it.  We were all checking you out when you walked in.  Trust me.  Come on, she's 18.  It's allowed.  It has to be said.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  You can hear in our voices how smitten we are today.  Not like being a kid-toucher.  That's psycho, Mark.  Jason, what do you got for?  Here it comes.  Speaking of kid-touchers, look.  Jason, what do you got for Jamie Lynn?  Yeah, I watch the show a lot, and with my dad, we really enjoy it.  And I was just going to ask you, but my dad and I, we had a bet, 
[01:46:00]  and we couldn't figure out how much weight you had gained between the seasons.  All right.  All right, enough.  So now we can't go to the ball.  Jesus Christ.  You know something?  Listen, you can't just go to the goddamn phones.  These people, I'm going to smack you all in the head.  We're going to take a break, Anthony.  You know, you got to have some sense. 
[01:46:30]  It's the minority of listeners that are being schmucks.  Let's take a quick break.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Opie, you're a sick-ass man.  Anthony, you're not a jackass.  You're obviously a star.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It makes me sassy.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony and Jamie Lynn Sigler.  Having a tough time pronouncing your last name, Jamie Lynn.  It's easy.  Having a lot of fun.  I don't know what the problem is. 
[01:47:00]  You know, I think I'm stuttering because she's so beautiful.  Meadow Soprano from The Sopranos.  I've never seen this many guys in the studio for one of our guests.  Matt Devote never comes in here.  You know what?  You never come in.  I had to say hi because all the towns in the show are where I grew up.  The hits on Tony and Montclair and in Bloomfield and in Patterson.  I'm like, my God, this is my backyard.  She's a celebrity in my book.  See, we can't truly relate because we're all Long Island people in here. 
[01:47:30]  You're the only Jersey guy.  Yeah, really.  Jamie's from the island as well.  Not too different.  Not too different?  I don't know.  Suburbs of Jersey as opposed to suburbs of New York like Long Island?  Like the sixth and seventh thorough of Manhattan and the rest of the area.  North Jersey and Long Island.  Well, do you have a question for Jamie Lynn?  You're a huge Soprano fan, Matt Devote.  Let's see.  Let's see.  No?  Oh, man, I got tons of them.  You do?  Well, we're waiting.  Give me a second. 
[01:48:00]  I'll get it down to one question.  Maybe Spaz.  I'll tell you what.  It's great.  You don't have a question?  Kevin, right.  How do you all fit inside the TV?  As I watch it, you look a lot bigger in real life than you see on TV.  Wait, get Spaz.  Let's see what Spaz would ask Jamie Lynn.  Spaz, you got a question for Jamie Lynn? 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, who do you think's stronger?  The rock or mankind?  Probably ask the most serious and boring question.  How'd you get in television?  Because I...  How'd you get in the television?  I check and I can't find a way to open it.  There's no little door in the van.  Because I've been to 21 play productions in college, so I'm an aspiring actor.  Aspiring actor.  Okay, well...  That's a good question, right?  I mean, that's a good way to start out.  That's what I did.  Could you give me an entrepreneur? 
[01:49:00]  No, I have no connections in that one, in that part.  But get an agent, get a manager, have him start sending out.  That's what I did.  There you go, Spaz.  Wow, you got actual information there.  Yeah, Spaz, do you have a follow-up question?  Usually...  No, you have nothing left in your head.  Who are you kidding?  You did great...  I'm not looking at me so pissed at you.  You did great on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire last night.  Everyone mentioned that there's a guy named...  I can't believe it!  There's a guy named Spaz on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire last night. 
[01:49:30]  I've been getting calls about that today.  Oh, there was a guy...  I think his real name was Kevin.  His nickname was Spaz, and he was on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire last night.  Wow.  How did he do?  He got 100 bucks.  No, we...  He got the 100 right, and then he took it and left.  What is your name?  I'm going to settle with 100 Regis.  I'm going to get out of here.  You said John.  Is that your final answer?  Yeah.  No, it's Kevin.  Get out of here, you moron.  Know what we need from one of our faithful listeners?  We need a tape of last night's show, because we could do some wonderful things with that.  Oh, I want to hear Regis saying Spaz. 
[01:50:00]  Sure.  Yeah.  All right, Spaz.  Very good.  What are you doing now?  Going back to...  Hey, Spaz.  Hey, Spaz.  Hey, Spaz, you want a peep?  You like the peeps?  No, no more.  Yeah, Spaz's getting a sugar high.  From one peep?  I think Jamie Lynn's...  Yeah, he would.  I think Jamie Lynn's looking at Spaz going, he can't be for real.  No, he's not.  I like biting the heads off the peeps first.  Actually, you know what?  What?  I got a comment instead of a question. 
[01:50:30]  Okay.  Tell the guys that write the script in the show that New Jersey's is not as small as it is portrayed.  And in one minute, they'll, like, shoot somebody in Patterson.  Then they're burying the body down by the Seaside Bridge like ten minutes later, you know?  But only Matt knows this.  It's true.  It's got to be factual.  Matt, the show goes all over the country.  People don't really know.  You know, someone in Arizona is sitting there going, hey, wait a minute.  That's at least a half hour drive.  Get there five minutes from here.  Five minutes.  You're right, actually, because I'm yelling at the screen when Uncle Junior took over. 
[01:51:00]  And Anthony says, Tony goes, all right, you know, just give me Bloomfield and Union.  And I'm like, well, there's miles between those two towns, you know?  But I guess nobody picks up on it.  No one really picks up on it.  I love the show, man.  No one really can.  I'm just so whispering, Rick.  Okay, terrific.  I don't even have headphones on when I heard that.  Now, taping is done for the season, right?  Yeah, we're done until it's done. 
[01:51:30]  So you know how the whole thing ends?  Yes, I do.  Could you give us a hint?  Even I don't know.  Do you know?  You haven't even told your brother how it ends?  Wow, that's secretive.  It goes on from episode to episode.  So you can't tell us, like, who's going to die?  Why would you want to know?  I know, that would wreck it.  Who would do it?  You know what you should do is tell your brother some of this stuff.  When he's going out to the bars and stuff, he can make bets and make a lot of money.  He could.  I think what's going to happen here is...  Wow, that was pretty good.  Can we ask you some vague questions? 
[01:52:00]  Kind of vague, like, will somebody die?  Well, that's a given.  That's pretty vague.  Someone of importance.  Oh, look at her.  She's not talking.  His name ends in a vowel.  I'll give you that much.  I'd be getting so much trouble.  Yeah.  Every time we had a read-through for the next episode, they would say, every time, do not 
[01:52:30]  discuss anything that goes on.  Really?  Yeah.  They're, like, really vague on keeping it, like, secret.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I bet your cousin there, what's his name?  Michael?  Michael, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I bet he screws up.  That's a given.  Well, yeah, of course.  Okay.  All right.  I wonder if he gets popped.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  I can say that. 
[01:53:00]  No.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh.  No?  No.  God, anyone could use a bullet.  I love when he walks into, like, a Kentucky project and it's something and starts going  off on black guys.  You're just looking like, oh, my God, he's going to get killed.  Here's what you would call a jadrul.  Yeah.  I don't know what that means, but I've been called it a lot when I was a kid, so I guess  it's stupid.  I don't know.  Still not.  Yeah.  Still not.  Look at me.  You think I know Italian?  Yeah.  I have no clue what you guys are talking about.  Opie.  Yeah. 
[01:53:30]  Shut up.  Opie, what crime family are you from?  Yeah.  Okay, driven.  Okay.  Well, I guess we've got to thank Jamie Lynn for stopping by.  No problem.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  This was a celebrity.  We never have celebrities.  This was a real treat for us.  Yes.  And thank you for Opie's Ricky Martin poster.  You're welcome.  Yeah, we've got to thank her for all the prizes, gifts she gave us, the marshmallow peeps.  I'll tell you one thing.  This Ricky Martin poster is going to end up hanging in our office, but I'm sure someone 
[01:54:00]  will alter it slightly with a magic mark.  In what way, I couldn't tell you, but we'll have to have you sign it, and then we'll proudly  display it in our office.  I tried to get a No Doubt poster, but...  Come on.  She does listen to the show.  Do you like No Doubt?  No.  Okay.  18-year-old girl doesn't like No Doubt.  I'm going to the concert.  Final answer.  What pants are you into? 
[01:54:30]  I like Madonna.  Yeah?  Okay.  Are you going to go see a new movie?  I'm not...  Yeah.  I mean, I like...  I feel a little better now.  If you go in my car, I have, like, Jay-Z, I have Nas, I have Madonna, I have New York  City Underground, and I have Celine Dion.  Oh, Celine.  We love Celine Dion.  Have you heard Anthony Celine Dion impression?  No.  Oh, we've got to end with this.  You've got to give her just a little.  I know we're putting you on the spot, but...  No, I can't do any impressions today. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, look at her.  She's right there and stuff.  All right, quick one.  Just a quick one.  So, I'm a musical, too.  I play the slide flute.  Wow.  I'm like Zam Fear.  Just give her a little.  Give me...  Make me laugh.  This song goes out to everybody that was on board the mighty ship Titanic that night so 
[01:55:30]  many years ago when she struck an iceberg and many perished.  But it does not just go out to those that lost their lives that faithful evening.  It goes out to those who lived on, made lives for themselves after that horrible cold night  in the North Atlantic.  It goes out to the same pipe.  It's very good. 
[01:56:00]  I've had it.  Celine.  I feel stupid now in front of a big celebrity.  You did fine.  That was good.  That's the first time you've done a G-rated Celine Dion impression.  Well, you know, it's okay.  Nice guy.  Yeah.  Jeez Louise.  She's going to make her think I'm an idiot.  Too late.  No, she really is. 
[01:56:30]  Too late.  Shut up.  All right.  Well, we've got to thank Jamie Lynn.  Yeah, thank you very much.  No problem.  We've got to thank her brother for coming in.  Yeah.  Meadow Soprano.  I'm the Soprano.  Thanks for the beer.  And I hope you'll come back to our lovely radio show.  Yeah?  All right.  Very good.  Good.  I like that.  All right.  And as we walk her out and waste some time, we're going to play Bit of the Week here,  okay?  Oh, yes.  All right.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Here it is.  Bit of the Week on the Opie and Anthony Show.  WNW.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, stupid.  Wow.  Boo, boo, boo.  Or stupidity on the way.  Rub, rub, rub, rub, rub.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Ah!  Ah!  Get that view Friday with Opie and Anthony on 1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Damn, damn.  Having another fine show today.  Everyone all excited, running around.  They all got their pictures with Jamie Lynn Sigler. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Metal Soprano.  Psycho Mark, you look like a complete goofball when you got your picture taken with Jamie Lynn.  What am I going to do?  She's a huge star.  Yeah, she's cute.  She's adorable.  I know.  Everyone got their pics.  Yes.  We were very smitten with her.  Mm-hmm.  Very.  If you look over, and it's the girl from the show, you know? 
[01:58:00]  Okay?  Look, it's her.  You're all star-struck.  Start talking like an idiot.  Well, that's everything.  Yeah, why would today be any different?  Well, for some people, it doesn't matter.  Like, you know, Jay Moore comes in.  It's Jay Moore.  He's in movies and everything.  But, you know, you're just like, hey, he's just a dopey guy.  Yeah, he's not a star.  He's going to kick my ass.  You know, she's on a show, one of my favorite shows.  Yeah.  You just get all, like, all wacky. 
[01:58:30]  Like, oh, take a picture.  You feel all stupid.  All of a sudden, I feel like, you know, an idiot.  You know what?  We take pictures with everyone that comes by, you know, and it's cool and stuff.  But with her, we all felt like we were, like, posing for, like, a prom picture.  Yeah.  It was real awkward, you know.  So, everyone's trying to get their arm around her.  And then the picture, like, Matt DeBote's taking the pictures.  Yeah.  And then it's like, after five pictures, it's like, okay, all right, enough.  And then Matt goes, could someone take a picture of me now? 
[01:59:00]  Vertical.  Vertical, yeah.  I just thought it was funny because I've never seen you guys like that.  Yeah, see, we got it.  Somebody who was in the studio, you didn't want to touch her.  I'm like, guys, get closer to her.  No.  And you're like, no, though, though, that's okay.  I feel all funny and stuff, you know.  I know, but it's kind of weird to see, you know.  I know you guys in the back, you know, throwing the blow-up doll around, saying all you.  Oh, what are we supposed to do?  Hey, you want to go to the Jay Moore suite?  Yeah. 
[01:59:30]  You know.  We have some class.  It comes out every once in a while.  I watch.  It dribbles out once every friggin' year or so.  Like Kawhi.  Yeah, I mean, Jamie Lynn, if you're listening, that means a lot that, you know, we showed some class.  It means you're special.  Not, you know, special like Corky.  No.  Corky.  All right, and we've still got lots to do here.  Let me get under your skin.  Our phone line is 212-757-1027. 
[02:00:00]  Everyone's requesting the Friday song.  Keep it around.  Where is the Friday song?  How's your hole?  And then we've got to get Reagan on the phone.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we put off Reagan for about an hour.  Let me read this and make sure I remember what it was.  Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.  All right, you've got to.  I lost my paper.  You've got a few minutes, and then we'll get Reagan on the line here.  Yes.  Okay?  But in the meantime, it's a Friday favorite.  Right after this, the ex-president of the United States of America. 
[02:00:30]  I've got another sad article in the paper today about that.  Yes.  Okay, we'll be right back.  1027-WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony on the Instant Feedback.  Frank from Queens all pissed off.  Come on, guys.  This is the fourth week in a row I've sent an FU request in.  Please, guys, it caught my wife cheating on me,  and I would like to send a big FU out to Gloria and Jose.  It would make my day.  Thank you very much.  There you go, Frank.  Okay?  All right.  All right, let's go to the phones before we get to Reagan, Anthony.  Yes?  Remember Keith and Keith's mom? 
[02:01:00]  Keith and Keith's mom.  You don't remember Keith's mom?  Keith's mom.  Oh, my God, yes.  Yeah.  Of course.  That's a big controversy.  Yeah, Keith called in and caught his parents having sex.  And we talked to Keith about it.  Then we talked to Keith's mom.  Very, very entertaining radio, to say the least.  Well, I can't believe we're actually going to pick that up  when on line six on hold is Ron Reagan.  Well...  I'm reading it right on the screen.  Well, according to the paper, the Alzheimer's is so bad, 
[02:01:30]  he won't know the difference.  He won't even remember that he's been waiting so long on the phone.  Correct.  So let's go to Keith's mom first, and then we'll get to Reagan,  who is on hold on line six.  Very strange.  He's on hold on line six.  Anthony's still in the studio.  And it says Ron Reagan right on the screen.  I see it there on line six.  I'm starting to wonder if you'll actually, you know,  make it through a Reagan interview today.  I hope so.  I seem to miss every one of them.  Keith's mom, what's up?  Hey, O&A.  How are you?  I'm okay.  Hey, I caught a lot of flack from the last time.  It appears that everybody can recognize my voice. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah?  That's okay.  I got called from Uncle's, search custodian.  That's okay.  You didn't do anything wrong.  Three packs of camel a day voice.  I kind of regretted a few things.  That's all right.  But the beginning of the week, you know,  because the show was getting a little boring.  So I thought to lighten...  What?  Hey, wait, wait.  What?  What?  To lighten it up a little.  Wait, what?  What was getting boring?  It was getting boring.  It wasn't funny anymore.  When?  Before.  When before?  I don't remember.  See, I don't even remember. 
[02:02:30]  What are you, Ronald Reagan with your Alzheimer's?  No, I like that.  Listen, you twat.  Oh, come on.  No, I'm not accepting that until you tell us when you felt the show was boring.  We're working our asses off over here, Keith's mom.  I can't remember right now.  Yeah, see?  No, you take it back right now.  All right, I take it back.  We're not damn right.  Yeah, I'm still listening.  It couldn't have been that boring.  We're not calling you up at home and saying, you know,  your anal performance with your husband was a little boring.  I am too anal.  I'm still stepping up a little bit. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, we were going to call Keith's mom and talk to her about being such a lousy parent.  No, I'm not a lousy parent.  Oh, we're working our asses off.  We take that personally.  And I'm glad she's staying on afternoon.  All right.  I'm sorry.  All right, Keith's mom.  Damn right you are.  All right, so what do you have for this boring show today?  This morning?  This boring show today.  I want to say, earlier in the week, you had a kid call up,  and he was going to be seeing the sex films in school. 
[02:03:30]  Yes.  And he was asking for questions.  Yes, questions asked the sex ed teacher.  Yeah, right.  And you made him hang out, which was, like, pretty good, you know?  Yeah.  But he came up with some pretty funny questions.  Speaking of boring.  Last year, Keith saw the films.  I was telling him to call that day.  He was calling for what he saw, because he always asks people,  Oh, come on, don't give me the ping-pong balls.  You're making our show boring.  You are the one making the show boring now.  All right.  Well, he saw the films, and he asked his teacher just how much fluid is in a wet dream. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  So I said, well, what did the teacher say?  The teacher said, anywhere between a teaspoon and changing your shorts.  Well, thank you, mom.  Oh, here he is.  Thank you, mom.  Put Keith on the phone.  Okay.  Hello?  Keith.  Yeah?  Your mom is wrecking the show today.  I know.  Do you understand how important the show is to us and our listeners and everything?  And your mom, your mom is wrecking it. 
[02:04:30]  Could you scream at her for us?  Just go, Mom, you're wrecking the Opie and Anthony show today.  Say, Mom, you're a tool.  Mom, you're wrecking the Opie and Anthony show.  Call her a tool.  Tell her to pull...  She wants what tickets?  She wants tickets.  Oh, yeah, she'll be getting those.  Yeah.  Call her show boring.  All right, Keith, we've got to let you go.  All right.  Ronald Reagan's waiting on line six.  All right, Keith.  Bye.  I've got to go to Boy Scouts.  All right, bye.  Boy Scouts.  All right.  Anthony?  Yeah. 
[02:05:00]  Reagan's in the paper again today?  Yeah, I see.  It's reported in the Post and the Daily News.  The Reagans, Nancy and Ron, marking 48 years of marriage together this coming weekend.  How about that?  And there's a picture of the lovely couple in the paper today, and it looks like he's not  doing too bad.  Ex-President Ronald Reagan is kicked by wife Nancy on his 89th birthday, February 6th.  Look at his hands.  They are just leaning on the table.  Well, she's got her hand behind his neck, turning his head towards her head, and he's 
[02:05:30]  barely puckering his lips.  I don't think he even knows what he's doing in this picture, where he's kissing Nancy.  And, oh, my God, what happened to her?  What?  I mean, she's obviously never a looker or anything, but, oh, looks like she's melting.  And what's going on there?  She looks like a chimpanzee.  Damn.  All right.  No, no, no.  But there were some problems, I guess? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Let me read a little bit of this for you.  Just a little bit.  Because then we've got to get to Reagan.  He's on line six there.  Los Angeles, Ronald Reagan and wife Nancy celebrate their 48th wedding anniversary this weekend  as the shadow of Alzheimer's disease dims the former president's golden years.  Oh, damn.  His motor skills have so deteriorated that he reportedly no longer exercises and cannot recognize  videotaped highlights of his political life, Anthony.  Oh, that's awful.  Former President Ford said in a TV interview that Reagan, 89, did not recognize him when the 
[02:06:30]  two met several months ago.  So, People Magazine today reports that Reagan appears to be entering the final phase of  Alzheimer's disease.  We are afraid he might fall.  He walks around the garden.  And here's the kicker.  And occasionally, Mr. Reagan may try to stand in the pool.  The former leader of the free world is attempting to walk on water.  He had his finger on the button at one point.  He fought the commies. 
[02:07:00]  Right.  And now he's wandering the garden and standing in the pool.  Trying to stand in the pool.  Basically, trying to walk on water, Anthony.  That's great.  The focus of the day is Nancy.  And I don't think it will go beyond the year 2000 is what a few of the Reagan's friends  are saying, Anthony.  Like that's the, they think two grand will be the year he checks out.  Yes.  Oh, that's a shame.  And he didn't even recognize Ford when Ford visited him recently.  President Ford?  Yeah.  Gerald. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, wait a minute.  It was sad.  Ford said, I was there about 30 minutes.  Tried repeatedly to bring up incidents of our friendship that might stimulate some recognition  by him.  But tragically, it didn't help a bit.  The guy doesn't remember Ford.  No.  Well, I don't think much of America does either.  That's not saying much about Reagan's Alzheimer's.  I don't think much of us remember.  All right.  Well, let's go.  Ford is 86.  Yeah.  Reagan's 89. 
[02:08:00]  And Ford?  Correct.  Yeah.  Oh, life.  And Ford was the guy, you know, falling down all the time.  Yeah.  And he thought he had Alzheimer's when he was in office.  And he's doing better than Mr. Reagan.  So let's go to line six, Anthony, and talk to the former president of the United States.  Anthony.  Why?  What are you doing?  I don't know.  I've got to go out here.  Ant, it's not every day that the president calls a radio show.  I drank a lot of coffee.  I've got to take a leak.  See, hold him on the line. 
[02:08:30]  I'll be right back.  All right.  Well, I hear someone on the line.  President Reagan.  President Reagan.  Hello, I'm Julie, your time-life operator.  Hey, Mr. Reagan, what's going on today?  Hello.  How are you, sir?  I love anal sex.  Yes.  What are you talking about?  Me and Nancy.  Yeah.  We just use Sam Donaldson's wig glue as lubricant.  Hello?  Yeah, that's a visual we don't need today, sir. 
[02:09:00]  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Sorry, I had to say that.  You had to dump out of your own show.  Yes, I did, because you're a twisted F talking about having anal sex with Nancy.  Yes, well, we have to keep it fresh after.  Well, how long has it been?  You're celebrating your 48th wedding anniversary this week.  Jesus Christ.  Yes.  48 years with that big, huge head. 
[02:09:30]  My God.  48 years of, well, looking into the eyes of a bug-eyed alien.  Did I ever tell you how we met?  No, you didn't.  Well, there was a big flash around Area 51.  I was driving, and her big-headed alien head stopped my pickup dead.  Well, I thought she was kind of cute and bigged her up. 
[02:10:00]  You ever screw an alien?  I can't say I have, no.  Wonderful.  Yeah.  Hello?  Alien abduction, huh, Mr. Reagan?  That's how we met.  And I want to say something about Gerald Ford and what he said about me in the paper.  Okay.  That's not accurate.  No?  No.  He says you don't even recognize him when he comes around to visit.  I remember, Ford.  Yeah.  That was a transvestite bitch from Bangkok I nailed in 48.  I never forget a tight ass. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, my God.  So he can lick me.  He can, huh?  Yes.  So are you guys doing anything special for your 48th wedding anniversary this weekend?  Well, we're probably just going to sit around the house and play What's in Ron's Pants.  Well, these days it looks more like a turtle head caught in Christmas tinsel.  God damn mess.  Nancy's no prize down there either. 
[02:11:00]  My God, I saw her naked the other day.  Yeah.  What a horror.  It looked like President Taft eating a ribeye steak.  Well, thank God, yeah.  Remember that big mustangy, please?  Yeah.  Know the reference.  We figured it out.  I was going to say Grant, but that was too obvious.  Very good.  Yes, do you see the picture in the paper?  Yeah, Nancy is kissing you on your 89th birthday this past February.  Oh, my God.  Look at the shape of her. 
[02:11:30]  It was like kissing a piece of liver on a stick.  Jesus.  She's feeding you the birthday cake, too, there, I see.  Yes, she is.  Yeah, very nice.  When I hug her, it's more like hugging some of those Chili's baby back ribs.  Jesus.  My God.  Baby back ribs.  What a mess.  All right, listen, Mr.  And I'm glad I have Alzheimer's.  Why?  Well, if I didn't, I might remember that one time in my life,  my sack didn't look like two bocce balls in a sweat sock. 
[02:12:00]  Jesus.  I can walk on water, and I'm an airplane.  Wait.  Hey, wait.  Yeah, let's bring that up.  It says, and I quote,  We are afraid that Mr. Reagan might fall.  He walks around the garden and occasionally may try to stand in the pool.  Yes.  You're trying to walk on water, sir?  I'm Moses.  Let my people go. 
[02:12:30]  I'll part the Red Sea and lead my people to Trenton.  Hello?  Yeah, we're here.  Where were they going?  I don't remember.  Bangkok.  Bangkok.  Bangkok, right.  With that whore, Gerald Ford.  He tossed my salad, and I gave him a rusty trombone.  Well, bitch.  Oh, look.  Here comes the mothership for Mommy.  Finally taking her back to that home planet of bag of bones with big eyes. 
[02:13:00]  You're sick, man.  God damn, tip her head back and a pez comes out.  Yes.  Well, Mr. Reagan, there's someone on line, too, that is very pissed off at us for talking to you, I guess.  Yes.  Would you like to talk to her?  Of course.  It's not that Leonid Brezhnev, is it?  No, it's not.  I hated her, too.  Patricia.  Yeah.  Hello? 
[02:13:30]  You're on with the former president of the United States of America.  Is this Patricia Nixon?  No, my name is not Patricia Nixon.  Okay.  I just wanted to say that I really feel bad for you, and I'm sorry that you have to put up with such horrific, you know.  Yes, Nancy, you're talking about.  I know.  And her big, bloated, Mardi Gras float head.  Have you seen that thing?  My mother has Alzheimer's.  Yes.  And I know the pain that you're suffering. 
[02:14:00]  You do?  Yes.  I forget about it every day.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, wait a minute.  That last liver spot just popped on my face.  I'm officially black.  Oh, my God.  You guys are really horrible.  What are you talking about?  Oh.  You're horrible.  Yes, you're talking about that Sam Donaldson.  Because you're making fun of President Reagan.  We're talking to him.  We are.  I better be on my best behavior.  Hello, President Reagan.  Where is he? 
[02:14:30]  Why isn't he answering?  Former President Reagan.  I heard Trish Nixon say he's on the phone.  You guys.  What?  That's so mean.  Hey, do you have a nice ass?  Because Nancy's looks like a big head of cauliflower.  Only paler.  Hello?  Do you have a question for Mr. Reagan, Patricia?  Yes, I do.  No.  Mr. Reagan, tear down that wall.  I'm confused. 
[02:15:00]  No, I don't have a question.  Okay.  Thank you, Patricia.  You are.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  Wait.  Mr. Reagan, you can't curse.  Well, ever then.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  What a twat.  I learned some new words.  I'm listening to this show, the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, you like it?  What a couple of ass wipes.  But, well, they're funny.  All right.  Yes.  Well, I guess we're going to let you go, Mr. Reagan, okay? 
[02:15:30]  Okay.  Well, have fun, you know, on your wedding anniversary, 48 years this weekend.  Are you guys going to have an intimate night there?  Anal sex.  Anal sex.  That's what me and Nancy are doing.  Anal ferrano.  Anal sex in the pool.  Jesus.  Okay.  Call me again soon before, well, the year 2000 is over.  Okay.  Because I'll probably be dead.  All right.  There he goes.  Thank you.  The former president of the United States of America.  Where?  Where? 
[02:16:00]  You, Mr. Reagan.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  I forget.  I'm surprised that Nancy hasn't discovered that you're talking on the phone today.  Well, I believe she's on Venus today.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yes.  All right, man.  Goodbye.  Bye.  There he goes.  Mr. Reagan.  Jesus.  Where the hell did Anthony go?  All right.  Anyway, we've got to take a break.  Oh, God damn.  Ant.  Woo!  Almost missed him again.  Ant.  President Reagan, when you were commenting on the fall of communism, 
[02:16:30]  I want to know what you were...  Yeah.  What?  What?  He's not on the line anymore.  God damn.  You can't hold him until I'm in the...  You said you were going to take a leak.  That was 15 minutes ago.  You missed it again.  Well, maybe next time.  That's all I can say.  And look, do you have your little piece of paper with all the questions written down for  him and stuff?  I remember Ford, that transvestite from Bangkok.  No, no.  Hailed in 1948. 
[02:17:00]  What's he doing with Sam Donaldson's wig glue?  No, no.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Last couple of days, we've been featuring Brian Reagan.  This could be the last track we play.  He'll be in soon.  Yeah.  All right.  And we'll be back.  Stay there.  It's WNEW.  Hey, listen up.  This is Dee Snider, formerly of Twisted Sister, now the star of stage and screen. 
[02:17:30]  And I'm a damn radio personality in my home right now.  And I'm just hanging out with Opie and Anthony.  These guys have some serious psychological issues.  I mean, you've got the new chicks in there.  You've got the piercings.  They've got all some wacky stuff.  I was the most normal person in the room.  Opie and Anthony, afternoons, 102.7 WNEW.  Go!  Ah, yes.  And it's Opie and Anthony.  Nothing wrong with a little sing-along for a Friday.  Oh.  That's the ladies from Red Peters. 
[02:18:00]  Checking out some tracks from his new CD.  Old Blue Balls is back is the name of his latest CD.  Yeah.  Got to get red on the show.  You're right in.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  We're getting ready to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show in a few minutes.  Let's go to Mike first.  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  What's up, buddy?  What's going on?  How are you? 
[02:18:30]  Did you watch SmackDown last night?  Unfortunately, I did not, but I heard there were wow signs all over the TV again, huh?  There was a wow sign out there that Dwayne has a man boop sign.  I heard there was a We Deliver Kegger's sign as well.  Yeah, I didn't see that out there.  That was on SmackDown.  Cool.  Yeah, it was cool.  When The Rock came out, the sign went straight up.  When he was walking down the ramp, you'd see it perfectly.  He has a man boop.  That's hilarious.  Well, thank you, Mike.  Can I get wrestling tickets?  We gave them away.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  All right, man. 
[02:19:00]  I'm sorry.  We'll have more next week, though.  All right, man.  Okay.  Great from all the white.  Speaking of, like, Psycho Mark psychopaths, we have another one in the studio today, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Of course, the Psycho Mark psychopaths are the guys that are taking the lead of Psycho Mark and getting on TV with the wow signs and stuff.  Yes.  At the wrestling events, at the Islander games.  I'm hearing it's happening there.  Yeah.  All over TV when the news reporters are trying to do their live shots on the streets of New York.  Yep.  And we've got to say hi to Anthony.  Hey.  How you doing? 
[02:19:30]  How you doing?  Is everyone named Anthony that listens to this radio show?  Yes.  Very happy with that.  It's the most popular name associated with the show.  So, Anthony, you did something a little different with the wow, huh?  Yeah, last night on this RNN chat TV.  It's in the tri-state area.  A whole bunch of counties get it.  And we did this thing where they had this scrolling chat room on the bottom of the screen.  Yeah.  And they were talking about Diallo, and they had a guy from 100 Blacks for Law Enforcement or something on there.  Yeah.  So, they're sitting there having a serious talk, and I'm under there going,  Opie and Anthony, 1027, those guys know what they're talking about. 
[02:20:00]  They're backing the cops back to them.  I'm putting wow all over the screen.  Cyber attack.  Yeah, it looked real funny.  Everyone else is talking all serious.  You see these wow things all on the screen.  Yeah.  And it's pretty funny.  All right.  Yankee bleacher creatures, big fans of yours.  Oh, cool.  We're fans of theirs.  It's kind of like what they do on TRL on MTV.  Yeah.  Where they have it scrolling at the bottom of the screen or whatever.  Right.  But you just chat and sit there on the computer and put it up on the screen.  And I just thought it would be a good chance to get with the psychopaths. 
[02:20:30]  Well, we definitely appreciate that.  Cool, man.  Ben's going to hook you up with all sorts of stuff, man.  Where are you from?  Fairfield, Connecticut.  You guys got a lot of fans of Connecticut, man.  I know.  We're going to try to get up to Connecticut, and we're going to try to get up to Westchester.  Yeah, we've got to make the rounds to the entire listening area.  I think the next road show we're going to do is in Jersey, in the heart of Jersey.  Yeah.  A little south.  Not Hoboken.  No, we're going to go a little more south than Hoboken, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nothing, we don't have anything against Hoboken.  We have just one club. 
[02:21:00]  Just one club that will remain nameless at this moment in time.  And then we'll get our asses up to Westchester and Connecticut.  Maybe we'll find an area that's good for the Connecticut listeners and the Westchester listeners, okay?  Guys, before I go real quick, I go to school that I own, I'm a major broadcaster.  I'm sorry to hear that.  I know.  And, you know, Spaz is like a legend over there.  Get out of here.  Why don't you guys make fun of him?  I'm telling you, he's like a legend over there.  Everybody, all these teachers, Professor Smith over there, all they'll do is pump up Spaz, 1027, Spaz.  It's amazing to see what happens when you get a diploma from Iona. 
[02:21:30]  You get a job at a major at the number one afternoon show in New York City.  What do they say about him?  I don't know.  They just always start with, you know, Spaz, a crazy kid, you know, whatever.  They talk like, you know, Spaz, you know, whatever.  It's great.  He's a legend, huh?  Yeah, he's like a legend with all the girls over there.  Hey, this is fabulous, man.  I'm a legend.  Isn't it great?  That's good.  Hey, you want a Ricky Martin poster?  No, man.  Yeah, take the Ricky Martin poster, please.  I felt bad for you guys when that girl was in here, man.  Why?  No, that guy that called up with the eating disorder, she talked about the big eating disorder, 
[02:22:00]  and then she, you know.  Yeah, it got a little, our interview got a little rough today.  Yeah.  She was hot, though, man.  She's smoking.  Jamie Lynn.  No problem, man.  Metal Soprano, she was in today.  Wasn't she?  And a very cool girl.  Yeah, it was.  Yeah, whatever.  We better just move on.  It was a little rough today.  All right, man.  We want to thank you for coming in, though, and helping us out.  Thanks, man.  I appreciate it, man.  Helping spread the word of the O&A show, all right?  Got this little prize package over there.  Very nice.  All right, Ant, we got to take a quick break. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  And up next, as we finish off another fine week of radio, we will play What Do We Learn?  On the O.P. and Anthony Show today.  All right.  O.P. and Anthony.  Are you in love with each other?  Yes, we're homo.  Love gay people.  Love gay people.  Yes, we're homo.  It's so easy to get guys naked.  Yes.  These two have a lot of pent-up sexual frustration.  Yes, we're coming out.  We're gay.  Hey, is this the homo Anthony Show?  Yes, O.P. and Anthony.  Two guys who are not afraid to love each other. 
[02:23:00]  We're here.  We're queer.  We're fabulous.  Get used to us.  1027 WNEW.  Here's a story of a guy named O.P.  He was hosting very boring radio.  It was lame and weak and sad on Long Island.  And he was all alone.  It's the story of Lazy Anthony.  Who was knocking, thin, and living in his car. 
[02:23:30]  He was very drunk and always hot.  A very funny guy.  And then one day when these losers met each other.  They decided to make a better plan.  Let's make a living watching porno.  And getting women to whip out their cans.  O.N.A.  It's O.N.A.  That's the way they became O.N.A. 
[02:24:00]  Ha, ha, ha.  Who the hell made that?  That's pretty funny.  First of all, I had a nice little radio show on Long Island.  Thank you very much.  I had some fans.  I had some people that liked the show.  And I don't think Anthony was high all the time.  Maybe drunk, but not high.  Yeah. 
[02:24:30]  How was that?  I think someone took liberties with that little song.  Yeah.  I'm insulted.  I had a little career before Anthony.  Of course you did.  Trust me, it was little, but...  Long Island, sure.  Come on.  All right.  What the hell.  We'll accuse everyone else.  Someone should be able to accuse us.  And they do.  Yes, they do.  Anthony, let's play a quick game of what did we learn on the O.P. and Anthony show today. 
[02:25:00]  Yes.  As we get the phone calls situated, I want to thank everybody for listening to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Can't really get into details, but we had another ratings trend come in today.  And we did really, really, really, really, really well.  Thank you.  Incredibly well.  Thank you very much to the listening audience.  It's a little trend, though, so we don't want to get too excited until the ratings book comes out in another, I don't know, month or so. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  But things are looking very, very good for this radio show.  And we really appreciate it because you guys, you know, you make the show happen, man.  Right?  Yeah.  So we'll try to pump out consistently the same quantity, dribbling, crap that you hear on this show.  So cheers.  Yes.  If we could get you all in a bar, we'd have a beer with you, but...  We've got to get a much bigger bar, we've learned. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, we did learn that.  We've got to do something for St. Paddy's Day, Anthony.  Ah, yes.  Know what I'm feeling for St. Paddy's Day?  What?  I'm feeling one of those spur-of-the-moment things where you and I just kind of leave the studio late in the show...  Go to a bar?  ...and go to a bar and drink.  I'm feeling one of those.  I like that.  What are you thinking?  I totally like that.  We don't have enough time to put a complete road show together, but I'm thinking St. Paddy's Day, it's on a Friday, two weeks from today, right?  Yeah.  We'll just get up and leave the show around, I don't know, five or so. 
[02:26:30]  Grab the cell phones again and just...  And hit one of the finest establishments right here in the area.  I like it.  I think that's what we're going to do.  Cool.  That's what we're going to do.  So, yeah.  Okay.  We're located at 57th and 7th, so keep that in mind in two weeks.  We can't really announce the place ahead of time because it gets too zany.  Yeah.  Too crazy.  A few thousand people show up, maybe.  But I think that's what we've got to do for St. Paddy's Day.  Drink some green beer.  Do some drinking.  All right, Ant, let's go to the phones, huh? 
[02:27:00]  All right.  And we'll start with Joe, Joe Soprano from foundrymusic.com.  Hey, hey, how are you doing?  What's up, Joe?  How are you today?  I'm fine.  Good.  Website's fine.  Good.  What I learned today is that for the best results of anal sex, pineapple around the leather  Cheerio does the trick.  Very good.  Absolutely correct.  I also learned that the guy screening the calls has more personality than his bad because  when I told him that, he almost died laughing.  Oh, someone actually laughed at screening the calls. 
[02:27:30]  Yes, he has never screened the calls.  Like, when I say something funny, he's like, high plan way, you know.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  You know what we're thinking of doing next week?  Mm-hmm.  I was just talking to Scott Colombo, who takes care of all the computers and stuff around  here.  We might put up a spaz cam one day next week that is just a camera on spaz answering phones.  I remember when you had a studio cam, you know, into the studio.  Yeah.  Those are the days.  Yeah.  One of these days.  We're going to get all that back again.  But I think next week we're going to start off with the spaz cam. 
[02:28:00]  That's a great idea.  What do you think, Ed?  I like it.  Just his big, goofy face as he's answering the phones with the McDonald's drive-thru thing.  Yeah.  He has to wear hair.  That's good.  And by the way...  And then we'll have Psycho Mark in the background just holding up signs and stuff for the webcam.  Pulling up wow signs.  Yeah.  We'll be liver keggers and all that.  All right.  We're going to work that out for next week.  What the hell?  Hey, by the way, Rick forgot to do his homework.  Where is that Rolanda tape?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  Where are you putting that in, Rick? 
[02:28:30]  It's a chicken.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  Hey, by the way, don't forget the Soprano stars should eat this Sunday because of that movie  if those donuts could bump.  Very good.  Yeah.  Who the hell is going to watch that piece of crap rap?  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  Peace.  There he goes, Joe.  Christine, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I learned that Bill Cosby tries...  Christine?  I'm 30.  Wow, you sound...  I thought you were going to say 13.  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  Thank God you said 30.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Christine.  All right.  I'll give you a shout-out.  Yeah.  A shout-out.  A shout-out to James from New Jersey.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  That's a 13-year-old boy.  That's not a 30-year-old girl.  Shout-out.  Hey, what happened to the anal sex lady?  Dawn?  We want to know if Dawn had anal sex today.  Yeah.  If she's listening, please call before we get off the air.  Wolfstack from New York City on the Instant Feedback.  I learned that Dice and Nancy Reagan are having anal on the planet Venus. 
[02:29:30]  What?  Dice.  I don't know what that means.  Maybe the president of Nancy Reagan.  Mike from Jersey.  I learned that Julia Child likes to marinate the leather Cheerio.  Yes!  Money of Maramond.  All right.  Let's go to Kelly.  Kelly, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, guys.  I learned that I hate people who make shout-outs.  Yeah, I know.  I learned that.  I told you guys it's great.  Thanks.  We really would appreciate it if you guys didn't do the shout-outs because it's really gay. 
[02:30:00]  It's retarded.  Because only the person you're shouting out to cares.  Shout-out.  So what's up, Kelly?  Like you're really listening.  Yeah.  I just want to let you know that what I learned today was that I have to remind myself when  I leave work to go to the bathroom before I get in the car and listen to you guys.  I practically peed in my pants today on the way home.  All right.  What got to you today?  Just the whole entire Julia Child thing was just unbelievable.  Whoa! 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Wonderful!  Can I just say one more thing?  Actually, I got two things.  What's all dirty, Ben?  I don't know.  I think he's a little pissed at us because we took a stand with the cops and stuff.  But the Diallo thing, I really think he's really pissed at us because we support the  cops and he obviously does not support the cops.  And we haven't heard from him since.  He's a hottie.  All right, Kelly.  Thank you.  Have a good night.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to George.  We're still hoping Dawn checks in to tell us how the anal sex went. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  George, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned that Reagan is now officially black.  Yes.  We have learned that he has so many liver spots, he's black now.  Yeah.  Very good.  And on the flip side of that, I also learned that Brian Regan is hilarious.  Yeah.  That's funny.  We're really trying to turn you guys onto stuff we like, and I hope you appreciate that.  I know it's kind of stupid when other shows play comedy CDs, but...  No, I'm digging it.  Digging it.  All right.  Good.  Good.  Because next week, I think I'm going to bring in some of my Bill Hicks stuff. 
[02:31:30]  Cool.  Bill Hicks is awesome.  Yeah.  We like Bill Hicks.  Another comedian that died way before his time.  Yeah.  Not that Brian Regan's still alive.  I'm sorry, but...  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, George.  Later.  Bye.  Let's go to DJ.  DJ, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned a couple things.  Yeah.  I learned what dump sweats are.  Yeah.  We all learned what dump sweats are, huh?  And I learned the Cod's cost is junk, Fat Albert.  Yes.  Very good.  And also, I never thought there would be a more uncomfortable moment than when The Rock 
[02:32:00]  was introduced to the sick boy.  Yeah.  Well, you did it today with Meadow when that guy called in.  That was just dead, silent train wreck.  Yeah.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  That was just a bad scene today, man.  All right, guys.  Have a great weekend.  All right.  Later.  That was just...  It was just not good.  Mm-hmm.  I didn't think people picked up on that, Ed.  I thought...  Very astute.  I thought we'd covered ourselves quite nicely on that one, but I guess not, huh?  Nah. 
[02:32:30]  All right.  Let's go to Mike.  Hey.  Hey, Mike.  What's up?  Hey.  How you doing?  Great.  Good.  I learned that Ronnie Regan still gives the anal.  Yeah.  He was talking about having anal with his wife, Nancy.  That's not good.  He's that old.  He's getting up still, huh?  Isn't that wonderful?  He must take Viagra.  We learned something today.  Absolutely.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Oh, God.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Oh, you got it.  Bye-bye. 
[02:33:00]  Bye-bye.  Please.  I'm waiting, but I don't think Don's going to make it in.  No.  It's too bad.  Damn it.  We gave her all that anal sex advice, and now she's not calling us back to tell us how  it went?  Let's go to Lori.  Lori, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that the guy I had sex with in the bathroom at the last road show isn't the  only one who asked, what are you going to do about this?  Oh, really?  Really.  You had sex in what?  The ladies' bathroom?  Yes, I did.  All right. 
[02:33:30]  You hose monster.  At the road show at Mulcahy's?  At Mulcahy's, yes.  So what, were you just hanging out, and he whipped it out and said, what are we going  to do about this?  Exactly.  You know, you had to do something about it.  You couldn't just get there looking.  And it worked, huh?  And it worked.  I'm a sucker like that.  A sucker, all right.  How did it go?  Were you guys in a stall or what?  Yes.  In the big one at the end.  Very nice.  The handicapped one.  Exactly.  Grabbing onto those rails.  Ah.  All right. 
[02:34:00]  Wonderful.  Well, thank you, Lori.  Okay.  Good night.  All right.  Bye.  We've got to step aside for Don and Mike, but you know what?  We have to talk to Dawn before we leave.  Yeah.  Dawn.  Hey, what's up?  Did you or did you not have anal sex?  We did.  You did?  Yes.  Okay.  You took a lot of advice from our faithful listeners.  Yes.  What did you end up using or doing or you know what I'm saying?  All right.  Did the on the belly.  Yeah.  Did the belly move?  Okay.  Yes.  And used the KY because that was all we had. 
[02:34:30]  KY.  Okay.  And slowly went in so it didn't hurt that much and actually lasted for about a good 10 minutes.  I was pretty proud of myself.  Okay.  Terrific.  After that, it was a little rough for me.  So good night again though.  Practice makes perfect.  Well, you were a little worried about it.  Wasn't it an enjoyable experience?  Yeah.  It wasn't too bad.  And we tried calling you guys and he was there, but he had to leave.  He rushed home from work for it.  Yeah.  And you guys were on with the Sopranos and I knew you probably, like I didn't realize 
[02:35:00]  that was going to happen.  Well, let me tell you, without giving away too much, Dawn.  Yeah.  It kind of shows that Ant and I have a heart because there was just a problem in the studio  and you were on the screen with your anal sex story and we just couldn't go there.  We had to take care of some stuff.  Oh, no.  I totally understand that.  That's why I was just like, damn.  So I'm glad you called back though and it went pretty well.  Yeah.  And you're going to try it again.  Yeah.  I have to thank you guys.  You were awesome. 
[02:35:30]  Dinner standing up tonight?  Hey, I'm getting taken out for dinner.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Now, did you have the anal sex while listening to us?  It was on in the living room.  Yeah.  I didn't know I can't listen to.  So what part were you listening to?  Your official anal sex radio show.  Right.  The Opie and Anthony show.  You were talking to the soprano girl about something.  That was a soprano about something.  Oh, really?  I really wasn't.  You weren't focusing on what she was saying?  No, I kind of couldn't hear her.  Why?  Your head was in a pillow. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, really?  Among other things.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  All right, Dawn.  Well, thank you.  Did you lubricate properly?  Yes.  Took many advice.  Much advice for that part.  That's good.  All available avenues.  And you're going to do it again?  Mm-hmm.  Okay, Dawn.  Well, thank you guys.  Have a great weekend.  You too.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Okay, terrific.  Kimberly.  Yo, I had to get through, Spaz.  We were actually...  You used this voice and said Kimberly, and he went for it? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  It had to be done.  But I would like to...  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, he broke the rules.  We got to hang up on it.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry, dude.  You just got to hang up.  We got to set an example.  I don't care if he had the best story ever.  You can't just BS on the phones because it makes a problem for us.  Yeah, that's kind of true.  That's it.  Because Spaz really does do a very good job screening the calls for us.  Why are you laughing?  How many times...  Hey, Steve.  Steve, you're on the air.  Steve, Steve, Steve, you're on the air. 
[02:37:00]  Steve, answer us.  Steve, Steve.  It's Bob.  It's Steve.  Spaz screwed up again.  Okay.  We got to get out of here, Ed.  All right.  Everyone have a great weekend.  We'll be back here Monday at 2.  Don and Mike up next.  Don and Mike up next.  Very funny.  Give them a try.  Give them a chance.  We are.  Okay?  Right.  All right.  It's kind of like a car wreck on the highway.  You're going to have to tune us in to see what the hell these idiots are doing next.  O.B. 
[02:37:30]  And Anthony.  We refuse to be responsible.  We refuse to be responsible.  One, two, seven.  W.  N.E.  W.  Thank you. </pre>
