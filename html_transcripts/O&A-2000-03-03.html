[04:30]
 It's so cool. I have nothing to do.  I think every time we open our mouths, we're pissing someone off.  We're out of control. We're so lucky.  All right. Knock it off.  1027 WNAW.  Hey. 
[05:00]
 Hey, gang. It's FU Friday.  Yes, it is.  With your pals, Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  We're here.  Phone line is 212-757-1027.  You can send your FUs into whoever you like through the fax line 212-957-9639.  Or you can use the instant feedback through the WNAW.com webpage.  Okay? Just click our section and you'll find us there.  Also, a bunch of people want us to start promoting AOL chat rooms. 
[05:30]
 Really?  Yeah. We did it yesterday and I guess it was a huge hit.  I guess there's Opie and Anthony chat rooms all over AOL.  I believe in Town Square.  So if you want to join some freaks from the radio show...  Not like any of the AOL chat rooms I've ever been in.  I know.  I remember when I used to go to the AOL chat rooms, it was usually to trade pornography.  That was the best.  Remember that?  Remember before...  I mean, we're talking before the internet really had websites that were just chock-full of porno. 
[06:00]
 Everyone had it, but there was no real place that it was stored.  So you had to trade it.  You traded, you go into a chat room and you're like,  Hey, any GIFs? GIFs? GIFs? Any GIFs?  I'm looking for JPEGs.  JPEGs?  Of like anal.  Anal?  You got them?  And then all of a sudden you're a male. You've got mail.  Bing, bing, bing. You're like,  Oh, I got some new ass pictures.  I'll trade you naked pregnant pics.  Yeah. 
[06:30]
 But now you can just find it on the web.  That's all I have.  You've got mail.  You've got mail.  And it was like, it was like getting a GIF, right Anthony?  Yeah.  But then you'd have to, uh, you'd have to send back some.  Uh-huh.  I'd always bail out of the room at that point.  No, you were one of those dirtbags.  Yeah.  Just take my freebies and leave.  I used to hate those people.  I promise I'll send back if you send me one and you send them one and then they bolt on you.  You've got cash.  All right. Well, uh, do you have any FUs today? 
[07:00]
 Let me think.  Hey, F you to, uh, the people that were supposed to deliver my foosball table Wednesday.  What happened?  They never delivered it.  I'm pissed.  What about my foosball table?  Maybe you weren't home when they were delivering it.  That's no excuse.  Is it like the cable guy you got to wait around all day for the pen?  Yeah, for a foosball table.  For a foosball guy to show up?  I bought a foosball table and, and, and it hasn't been delivered.  They said Wednesday and I tell them the hours I'm going to be home and nothing, nothing.  No note shoved in the door. 
[07:30]
 Nothing.  And you're not sharing?  Why?  With the show.  What do you mean?  If you bought a foosball table, you got to like bring it into work.  Can you imagine a foosball table in the, in the studio here?  That's for, no, no, that's for my playhouse.  Well, what about the...  Ames Galore.  Ames and fun.  What about the Opie and Anthony tree house we're building here?  Have one of the sales people get us a foosball table.  You know, eventually the studio is going to be completely ours and we're going to make everyone else broadcast somewhere else.  Somewhere else?  Oh yeah. 
[08:00]
 We're going to like remodel this whole place.  It's going to be just, I don't know.  That would be pretty cool.  A foosball table.  Yeah, we could just like play while we're broadcasting.  We'll have a TV with PlayStation 2.  Yes.  Hoi, hey.  PlayStation 2.  You see all the jazz waiting for PlayStation 2?  Yes.  They're all waiting online.  Hoi, hey.  Wait for PreyStation.  PreyStation.  Yeah, they're all sitting online waiting for PlayStation 2.  All right.  So your FU is to the foosball people, Anthony? 
[08:30]
 Yeah.  All right.  It was the family gaming center over there in the mall over in Staten Island.  Okay.  I'm pissed.  Send me my goddamn foosball table.  I'm pissed.  All right.  Well, my FU is a little weird, but I think people will understand.  A big FU to the daily news.  Yeah.  The sports page, sports, the back page of the daily news, you know, they have the sports  obviously. 
[09:00]
 Yeah.  Big FU to the daily news for showing a picture of John Starks in a bull's uniform.  That is sacrilege.  Absolutely sacrilege.  Poor John Starks had to get traded to the bulls.  He doesn't want to be there.  We're embarrassed for him.  He has to like play for the bulls when, you know, the Knicks just absolutely hate the  bulls, always have, always will.  Yeah.  And there's like John Starks, who was one of the hearts of the Knicks teams over the  years in a bull's uniform. 
[09:30]
 And then the daily news has to show the picture on the back page of the daily news today.  Well, the post has him in a Knicks uniform.  That's why I didn't give the FU to the post because the post was smart.  There they show John Starks in the uniform he should have on, the Knicks jersey.  It says bring back Starks.  There's a chance that the Knicks might get John Starks.  This is basketball, right?  After you, Mark.  Life doesn't revolve around a smoke and dope.  There's other things people like to talk about.  And one of them is the Knicks and sports in this town, you ass. 
[10:00]
 Jesus.  It's a big deal, Tuss Nick fans.  But yeah, they're reporting that the Knicks have a chance of getting Starks back.  That would be huge for the Knicks' playoff run.  It would be absolutely huge.  He was good at getting the home runs.  Or is it the touchdowns?  All right, man.  If anyone wants to do sports for our radio show, apply.  Come on.  We need to talk sports a little bit on this radio show.  It's doing great.  I'm pouring my heart out about the Knicks and John Starks and no one around here cares. 
[10:30]
 Sorry.  All right.  I would like to, but basketball just ain't my thing.  I understand a lot of people like it, and that's cool.  It's very New York, the Knicks.  Oh, I was upstairs?  Yeah.  You know the old boss, Scott Herman?  Scott, yes.  Who we still truly love for the fact that he brought us to New York and all that?  Yeah.  I went to visit him, and he's the holder of the Knick tickets.  Ah, yes.  For a keeper.  For WNEWN wins.  The keeper of the ticks.  So you got to go up there once in a while and you spend some time with him and then you 
[11:00]
 start hinting about the Knicks and stuff.  Oh, is that your angle?  What are you kidding me?  I don't know what your play is.  You think I go up there just to have coffee with him and stuff?  Yeah.  So I shoot the S with him and stuff, and then I start talking about the Knicks casually.  Hey, uh.  I'm like, hey boss, you know, if you have any tickets laying around, you know, you know  who to give them to, right?  Oh, I got a couple over here.  So he goes into his little cabinet.  He goes into the drawer, and I'm like, oh, yes.  I'm thinking he's going to give me tickets to a really good Knick game, right? 
[11:30]
 Yeah.  This shows we don't rate at all with the old boss.  Oh, come on.  What did he give you?  Vancouver.  Is that bad?  Yeah, that's bad.  Why?  You get to see the Knicks.  Knicks Vancouver game?  You want to like Knicks Toronto.  You want Knicks Miami.  Knicks Celtics is always a fun game to watch.  What's wrong with Vancouver?  They're 18 and 39.  Is that bad?  That's really bad, but.  I don't know.  But I want to thank the boss for giving me a pair of tickets. 
[12:00]
 You're going to see the Knicks, not Vancouver, so who cares?  All right.  Well, and we should come across with some tickets to like the Yankees or something when they  start playing.  That's what I want to see.  I didn't get any last year.  Nothing.  Maybe a couple of Jets Giants games during football.  Nothing.  Nothing, nothing, nothing.  Basketball, he's got them out the yin-yang.  We had a ton of Jets tickets last year.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, we did.  No one offered many.  No one really wanted to go after Vinnie went down.  Yeah, that was true.  You know, it was kind of a drag season and then they turned around and had a really good 
[12:30]
 year.  Yeah.  Considering.  But at first, no one wanted to go to the games.  A lot of his tickets just rotted in that drawer of his.  Rotted.  All right, and we got to take our first break here.  All right.  It is FU Friday.  On the way, I got a song for the critics of our radio show.  Oh, you do?  Oh, yeah.  It's pretty funny.  All right.  It's a new song from Red Peters.  Red Peters.  From his new CD.  And we'll play that next.  How's that?  All right.  And more of your phone calls.  Stay there.  Opie.  Boring. 
[13:00]
 Anthony.  Boring.  Producer Rick.  Boring.  Spat.  Yay, yay, yay.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  WNEW.  Sometimes you feel like a mess.  Booty dooty.  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell.  Opie and Anthony.  WNEW.  It's FU Friday.  Another fine week of radio almost behind us here, Anthony.  Yeah.  We'll pretty much talk about anything we covered this week.  Just in case you didn't get through during the week when we were discussing.  We'll talk about the 
[13:30]
 We'll do some closure.  Closure.  It's a psycho battle.  You need closure.  Yeah.  If something hits you a little funny this week and you want to discuss a little further,  that's fine as well.  Look, we got some new stuff planned for you as well today.  All right.  John from Forest Hills on the instant feedback.  Oh, get over Starks.  He lost game seven against Houston in the 90s.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy. 
[14:00]
 We got Spreewell for him.  Spreewell?  Who's better than him?  I love Starks' heart, but he was so erratic.  You're right.  You are right, John.  I'd rather have Spreewell the choker.  I'd like a guy that'll choke somebody every so often.  I think he'll just be a good backup and he would give the Knicks a lot of heart as they  go into the playoffs.  And why not?  Why not bring back Starks?  It would be a big boost for the team in this damn city.  That's all I'm trying to say, if you think about it, really. 
[14:30]
 Got a little Brian Regan to me today.  That's all I'm trying to say, if you think about it.  We're going to have to play a couple more tracks from Brian Regan's CD.  That went over very, very well yesterday.  Yeah.  We're kind of trying to turn you guys on to the stuff we like, finally.  The music we like, some of the comedians we find funny.  And we're going to expand that concept of our show in the coming weeks, OK?  Absolutely.  All right, let's go to Jammer.  Hey, Jammer.  Hey, what's going on? 
[15:00]
 O&A.  How are you guys doing today?  Real good.  What's up?  That's good.  That's good.  Hey, on the way home last night, I was listening to, was it Don and Mike, the new guys?  Yes.  Yeah, and they were extending a hand to you.  You're looking forward to coming to New York next week.  They want to sit down and throw down a couple beers with you guys, party, get wasted.  Sure.  I don't think they can party like us, though.  Well, I know you guys are going to show them how to do it, right?  They've got to be, like, what?  Fifteen years older than us.  Are they?  I don't know.  You know, one of them...  I've known some older guys at the party.  Honestly, we're looking forward to having beers with them. 
[15:30]
 They sound the right...  The only thing...  One of them sounds like Lycus, man.  I just can't get over that.  No, no one sounds like that to me.  Well, you listen to one of them.  Jammer!  Exactly, exactly.  What happened?  I'm gone.  Yeah, Lycus, we don't talk about him anymore.  Done.  We accomplished our goal.  We got him out of this damn thing.  Hey, you did it, man.  You did it.  You did it.  All right, Jammer.  Hey, listen, real quick.  I tune in up in Boston every once in a while.  I'll let you know what else we hear up there.  When we get up there, we should drive a big truck.  Oh, okay.  I know who you are.  Yeah, yeah. 
[16:00]
 Run for Destiny Transport.  Yeah, you're the control guy.  All the guys in the bar listen to you.  You know, they're all...  Yeah, he makes the trips to Boston, to New York all the time.  Yeah, full-sweep.  Cool.  Jersey.  Out of Jersey, man.  All right, Jammer.  Right now, coming out of Anthony's hometown in the Static Island.  Got to pay my dues here and get back to the Yard.  All right, Jammer.  We got to fly.  Hey, have a good one, guys.  We'll talk to you later, right?  Diamond Dust, Wrangler, 10-4.  Diamond Dust.  Oh, big F you going out to the Bergen Record, the latest media outlet that has convinced 
[16:30]
 that you and I are going to Mornings.  Oh, yeah?  What'd they say?  That we're going to Mornings.  Oh, well, that's easy.  We already said we're not going to Mornings.  A lot of people saying we won't have a choice in the matter, though.  Okay.  A lot of people saying...  Oh, yeah, right.  Okay.  If the bosses say so, we jump and we go.  That's it.  No, we're doing too well in Afternoons.  We're doing really well in Afternoons.  Yes. 
[17:00]
 We're going to the latest little ratings thing we just got today.  Thank you.  Thank you to our listeners.  Yeah.  And to our critics.  Go F yourself.  Again.  Again.  Still, yeah.  Please.  Um, eh, want to play this little ditty for the critics, Anthony?  Yeah, what is it?  Yeah, what is this?  It's a brand new song from Red Peters.  Red Peters has a new CD out.  Uh-huh.  And it's a spelling song, Anthony.  A spelling song?  Okay.  A spelling song especially for the critics of the O.B. and Anthony show. 
[17:30]
 All right.  Take a listen.  Yeah.  All right, Red.  Another fine piece of work from our buddy, our pal Red Peters.  The spelling song off his new CD.  That rocks.  I kind of like it.  It pretty much says it all, right?  It's wrong of him.  Let's go back to the phones.  212-757-1027.  We go to Scott.  Scott, what's up?  Oh, hey, what's going on?  How are you?  Big FU at Columbia High School.  Why?  Because they're failing me in all these classes for cutting schools. 
[18:00]
 Well.  Yes, man.  Well, what do you expect?  You got to show up.  Well, I'm smart enough to do the work.  I might as well get wasted and, you know, and a big FU to end for not liking basketball,  by the way.  All right.  Hey, I was watching the on TV last night, the QBC guy was on.  Yes, yeah.  He was going absolutely nuts.  About what?  There was some kind of spring sale that they were having.  They were like giving away all these cards.  You reminded me of Chris Farley. 
[18:30]
 Just his face was all red.  He was sweating.  Yeah, he gets out of his mind, that guy.  He had all the cards and he was like throwing them around.  He was knocking stuff over and stuff.  It was absolutely hilarious.  I love that guy.  I haven't seen him in a while.  He was loving Stan Musial and Sosa and McGuire.  Still selling Sosa and McGuire stuff.  How could there be any more Sosa and McGuire rookie cards out there when they're limited edition?  Sosa and McGuire rookie cards.  We've only been selling these for five years, people. 
[19:00]
 There's only eight trillion billion up.  I can't do the voiceover.  I'm trying.  I can't do the voice today.  You almost made it through the week.  The voices will be back Monday.  See, I shouldn't delve into the QBC.  Look at you.  It's a mess now.  Scott, you just killed them for the day.  What about the Regis?  How about Kathie Lee quitting?  No, no, no.  All that's going to have to wait until Monday. 
[19:30]
 We do have good news though.  We're going to have a call from the former president of the United States of America today.  That's easy.  That's how you guys talk.  All right, thank you.  That won't kill your voice too much.  That doesn't hurt that much.  Okay, very good.  Dude, you almost blew out your voice.  I know.  We have four hours to go here.  I felt that itchy thing going on in the back of my throat.  I'm like, oh no, here it comes.  Hey, Liz, you're next on NAW.  What's up?  Hey, I'd like to give a F-U, excuse me, to my new ex-boyfriend.  New ex?  What?  8.30.  What'd he do?  He woke up at 3.30 in the morning.  He denied me.  He denied me.  He denied me.  He denied me.  He denied me. 
[20:00]
 He denied me.  He denied me.  He denied me.  He denied me.  He denied me.  He denied me.  He denied me.  He denied me.  He denied me.  He denied me.  He denied me.  He denied me.  He denied me.

He denied me.  He denied me.  He denied me. 
[20:30]
 He denied me.  My sister drove me home.  We fought the whole way home.  Then we woke up the neighbors in my neighborhood.  Really?  Yeah.  It was a big crazy.  But I'd like to give him an F to you.  What did you say?  Do me and he said no?  I'm sorry, what?  What did you say?  Do me and he said no?  I've been asking him for days.  He's been denying me.  He has no problem taking the B, Jaze.  No problem with that.  He doesn't want to work at it.  Exactly.  I'm tired.  Well, we get into those moods, us guys, where we just kind of get into the moods.  The boy doesn't even have a job. 
[21:00]
 What's he still calling you from?  Really?  Yeah.  We're more like the Cracky Smoking during the day.  Sounds like a bum.  Sounds like a bum.  Sounds like you might be better off.  I think I am.  All right.  You guys are amazing.  Well, thank you.  A big F to you to your ex-boyfriend.  Thank you.  And one more thing.  You guys, when you play music, you should try Slipknot.  We like Slipknot.  You're right.  I am.  You're right.  Fabulous.  All right, man.  We're going to go.  We're going to go.  We're going to go.  We're going to go.  We're going to go.  We're going to go.  We're going to go.  We're going to go.  We're going to go.

We're going to go.  Love the Knicks.  I used to like the Nets when they played on Long Island, but that's been a while, obviously.  Love the Knicks, Nets, and Jets.  Oh, well, okay. 
[22:30]
 I can forgive you for the Jets, at least.  Really?  Yeah, because I have season tickets for them.  You don't like basketball?  No, not really.  I'm 5'2".  I can't reach the basket.  It doesn't matter.  You don't need to be tall to watch the Knicks.  No, but you know, I got the scarring from gym class in high school.  Yeah.  So, you know, it just never worked.  I don't know if you guys ever heard of them, but there's a band named Dream Theater.  I know Dream Theater.  Awesome.  All right.  I went to the show at Roseland.  Yeah.  All the F-U's are people who start mosh pits. 
[23:00]
 All right.  As I said, I'm 5'2".  I got clocked in the head numerous times because of all these like little 12-year-olds moshing.  You know, we should talk about mosh pits.  There's bands you just shouldn't be moshing to.  Dream Theater is not a band you mosh to.  Well, tell all your little listeners, because there was all the like the super-moshers.  There was all the like the super little kids.  Oh, I think it's a corn concert.  Finally punched somebody in the head.  You know, I spent 35 bucks for a ticket.  I don't want to get punched in the head.  Let me tell you, I have been in the mosh pit for corn, and it is one of the sickest pits you'll ever see. 
[23:30]
 Exactly.  So you bring up a very good point.  It's not a corn concert.  Not a Dream Theater concert.  Yeah, Dream Theater is just, you don't mosh to Dream Theater.  You kind of sway back and forth to Dream Theater.  You get those lighters out every once in a while for Dream Theater, you know?  Exactly.  And I have to get in the guy who also tried to grab my breast when he was trying to get to the front of the stage.  Well, you got to give it to him.  Well, come on.  My boyfriend didn't even get to enjoy the show because he's worried about all these, you know, jerks trying to grab my breast. 
[24:00]
 That is, that does kind of suck going to like a concert with chicken stuff.  Exactly.  Because you can't even enjoy yourself.  You got to worry about all these dopey-ass guys trying to...  Trying to grab everybody's heart.  ...like pop feels.  Amanda, you must have a nice set though.  38 days?  Yeah, there you go.  Big enough?  You're working it.  Yeah, well, you know, when you go to the show, that's all I had.  My arms are on the breast and the boyfriend behind me.  Yeah.  All right, you guys rule syndication now.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye. 
[24:30]
 There she goes, Amanda.  Facts coming in.  Let's go, Rangers.  All right, as you see, I'm tooling up over here.  We got the coffee.  We're going to be set today, Anthony, once again, okay?  It's going to be a mess again.  Let's go to Mary.  A lot of women died checking in today.  Hey, O'Neill.  Maybe we'll turn this into ladies' day today.  Mary, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Love you guys.  Thank you.  Big F-U to the Canadian border.  Why?  Because my girlfriend and I went to drive up there to go visit a friend. 
[25:00]
 Which border?  Because I've been over many of those.  Johnston.  The one that Ogdenburg is on the New York side and Johnston's on the other side.  We went to the Cornwall one also.  Is that the one that's for Montreal, right?  No, we were going to Ottawa.  Oh, Ottawa, okay.  I haven't been through that one.  Stupid Canada.  Well, it's a pain in the ass to cross the border into Canada, man.  Totally ridiculous.  So you guys got caught doing what?  Well, I mean, we weren't doing anything.  My girlfriend, like 14 years ago, she was 18 years old. 
[25:30]
 She was asked by somebody who was, I guess, didn't have a very good reputation.  To drive her to her quote unquote cousin's house to pick up a couch or something like that.  Turns out it wasn't the guy's cousin's house and she ended up getting caught.  She was sentenced to 10 years, but they dropped it to five years.  It wasn't a couch either, it was cocaine.  No, it was not.  It was a couch and like two hunting duck things. 
[26:00]
 It was ridiculous.  Why?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You're making no sense.  What was the charge?  The charge was aiding and abetting, fifth degree burglary.  Oh, what?  They broke in somewhere and stole stuff and loaded it into the car?  Yeah, she stayed in the car.  She didn't know it was going to go on until they got up to the house.  Anyway, so they went to drive away and the people who owned the cabin stopped them and saw all their stuff in the car. 
[26:30]
 They called the police.  Anyway, so she got busted.  But it was 14 years ago when she was 18 years old.  So we went to try and go over and they wouldn't let her through.  We tried to go someplace else, the Cornwall one, the Cornwall crossing, and they wouldn't let her go over.  I see what you're saying.  You can't go to Canada?  Yeah.  That doesn't make sense.  There must be more to this.  It was 14 years ago.  Anyway, we were really pissed off, but that's my big F you. 
[27:00]
 They suck.  Well, thank you, Mary.  Okay, thank you very much.  Have a wonderful day and I love you guys.  Thank you. Have a great weekend.  You too. Bye.  Bye, bye, Mary.  All right.  Well, Ann, we've got to take a break.  Yes.  The last couple days we've been featuring tracks from Brian Regan's comedy CD.  Very funny guy.  We're going to have him here on the show.  He was in here about when we first started here at N.E.W., like the second month we were here. 
[27:30]
 So we're looking forward to his return visit and we encourage everyone to go see him.  I'm not sure where he's going to be.  We'll have all those details when we get closer, okay?  Yes.  But here's a track, Lousy in Little Lake.  I love this one.  Check it out.  We'll be back.  You guys can come play.  Piss me off, okay?  One, oh, two, seven, WNEW.  And it's FU Friday.  I need something to do. 
[28:00]
 2127571027 if you want in on the show today.  Psycho Mark's in the studio with a couple of his psychopaths, I believe.  Psycho Mark, who do you got over there?  My friend Jack Devaney.  As a matter of fact, we got fired from college radio together.  Oh, really?  All right.  It was quite an interesting incident, I may say.  Wait, wait, wait.  Psycho Mark used to do college radio.  He ran a college radio station, right?  Psycho Mark?  I couldn't believe it.  I couldn't believe it.  I couldn't believe it.  I couldn't believe it.  College radio. 
[28:30]
 Did you hear the stories of Psycho Mark?  He used to like, um...  Why not?  Can I go into it or what?  I've heard the dope stories.  There were job interviews with ladies and stuff, right?  Oh, wait a minute.  Was there a casting couch to be part of your little radio team when you were the program  director?  Ben?  Oh, great, Ben.  Here we go.  Let's talk about Mark's program director days.  All right, Mark.  So Mark was a program director of a college radio station.  There's a lot of college kids out there that want to get started in radio, Anthony, and 
[29:00]
 a good place to start is college radio.  Of course.  And unfortunately, some of these people had to come across Psycho Mark as they're trying  to get their careers going.  Ben, tell them one of the stories.  Well, there's so many.  How about the story of why you got fired?  How many times did you get fired from the college station?  Like three.  One of my favorite stories was there was the Duck Tours in Boston.  Yeah, those stupid things.  And they went by.  What did you say?  How did you put it?  The Duck Tours.  The Duck Tours used to go by and everyone would go, quack, quack, quack.  The Duck Tours, for anybody in New York, it's an amphibious vehicle, like an old Army surplus 
[29:30]
 thing that they load tourists in and then plunge them into the Charles River.  And they go floating around and looking at things.  Yeah, look at this.  It's Boston.  Oh my God, it's wonderful.  Not to be confused with the Ted Kennedy tour where you don't come back from.  And as I remember, a couple of years back one of those duck boats flipped over.  Every so often they flip over and a bunch of tourists perish.  And it's the funniest damn thing that happens in that town. 
[30:00]
 The Duck Tour.  So the Duck Tour is going by.  I'm live on the air.  I'm like, oh yeah, gee, there goes the Duck Tour.  I'm going to start my own tour.  Instead of driving around the good parts of Boston, we're going to drive around the bad parts of Boston  and we're going to yell, crack, crack, crack.  Instead of quack, quack, quack.  And you got fired for that?  Well, I said, we'll go to Roxbury or something.  Rock Dorchester.  It's predominantly black.  Yeah, very safe neighborhoods up there.  The president of the college got about 15 phone calls within the next three minutes.  Really?  Wasn't he sleeping with some of the chicks? 
[30:30]
 Come on, Ben, tell the stories.  Oh yeah, well, tell stories about how some of the girls got shows on the stage.  Oh, come on.  They had to have a little audition.  Ed, Ed, Psycho Mark had a casting couch.  Little girls would come to the stage and they want to start their radio careers  and they pretty much had to sleep with him to get a show.  Oh man.  No, wait a minute.  This is getting blown out of proportion.  Oh yeah.  Oh, I love that.  That's against the law, I believe.  This is totally getting blown out of proportion. 
[31:00]
 How many of the personalities did you sleep with?  I lost count.  A few, right?  A couple, yeah.  A couple.  But I mean, I didn't give them shows like instantaneously.  It wasn't like that.  Okay, terrific.  We got that one now, honestly.  You're going to hear that clip about a million times today.  Okay, terrific.  What about the day you got busted for the clouds coming out of your car 
[31:30]
 right in front of the radio station?  Like James McAuley.  I was thinking Lincoln.  We're in there with a meeting with the general manager of the station.  There was another kid that didn't like Mark.  So he came in and there were clouds of just pot coming out of Mark's car  right in front of the station.  So Mark gets the word about that because we have our audio class at four  that day and Mark splits, but only Mark's luck, the exact same Lincoln,  parked in his spot.  The professor was a little pissed off at that point.  But Mark has many definitely long stories. 
[32:00]
 Didn't you also get fired for mooning the whole school or something  on closed circuit TV?  Oh, that's right.  It's all coming back.  They had a camera inside the studio and it was being fed to all the dorm rooms  so all the dorm rooms could watch what was going on at the radio station.  Look at that, interactive.  So as being the program director, I was getting a lot of complaints from some  of the female jocks saying, you know, a lot of guys are calling up saying,  nice kids, you know.  And I said, well, Jesus.  What do they expect?  Well, exactly. 
[32:30]
 I said, well, we'll have to put an end to this.  So one day I'm on the air and there's one kid in the dorms, it just happened,  he would not stop calling me up going, oh, you look really handsome.  I'm going to come down there and give you a rusty compound.  So finally I started losing it because he kept calling and I started giving the  camera the finger and all that.  So finally to the point where I got up on the console and I pulled my pants down  and I mooned the camera and he presented the common cap to be giving a tour to  about 25 business people while it was being broadcast in the dining hall. 
[33:00]
 Okay.  You got to know when to use that line.  Okay.  Terrific.  Well, thank you, Mark.  Guys, here's the studio.  Anthony, what's up?  My brother was, I wonder, a duck tour.  He just started going out with his girlfriend.  He'd been going out with her for about a week and they decided to go away.  And the town they were in was hosting those duck tours.  About two hours into the tour, he broke out with the dump sweats and there was 
[33:30]
 nowhere to go.  The dump sweats.  And to make matters worse, they're driving around the duck tour and he's just  thinking, what are the dump sweats?  We can't get past the dump sweats line.  What is it?  Could you explain what the dump sweats is?  The dump sweats are when you got a gun and there's no way you can fight.  And you're going to have that accident, which leads to further into the story. 
[34:00]
 They got caught in traffic going back.  And the whole time the captain's like, who wants to drive the boat next?  And he's hunched over.  He's thinking about jumping in the water now because he's got to let go.  So on the way back to the hotel, he ended up letting it go in his pants.  Okay, terrific.  Really?  Which is a good argument for the tighty-whities because that's the only thing  to save them.  But on the way back to the stall, he took them off and then threw them under 
[34:30]
 the toilet.  Yeah, sometimes you've got to do that.  I just thought that was amusing.  Good job, man.  Syndication yesterday.  Well, we're working on it.  Thank you.  Take care.  A couple more rating trends like today and I think it will be inevitable.  Ah, got to say that.  Got to thank the listeners once again.  Thanking the listeners, yes, for knowing what show to listen to in the  afternoon.  Mark, you're next on WNEW.  What's up?  Hey, how's it going, Nolene?  Hey. 
[35:00]
 You guys are the best.  All I got to say about that, I go to Rutgers.  I'm pretty stoned right now.  Hey, hey, are we funnier when you're stoned?  You got to just find no matter what.  It doesn't matter, man.  This sounds better a lot now.  I'm just a little hungry.  But I just think F-U to all the fat and ugly chicks at Rutgers, at the bars.  Why?  They're just ridiculous.  You know, you see this pretty girl and she comes up to you and she smiles and  looks like she has bites in her mouth.  It's just ridiculous.  Now, one girl was like a Sasquatch.  It was a horrible night last night, guys.  So fat girls are hitting on you at the bar? 
[35:30]
 Yeah, you know.  Fat girls need loving too, man.  But this girl looks like a Cadillac.  Well, just smoke a lot more pot.  You won't know the difference.  I need to drink some more beer like that, I think.  All right.  By the way, I work at a local club in New Jersey called Shout.  I'd love to have you guys come down.  All right, we'll be there.  It's a big club.  Now, if you could switch me to someone, that'd be great.  Like how big?  2,000, 3,000 people?  About 2,500.  Really?  Yeah.  All right, because we're trying to figure out where to do the next road show.  It's got to be in Jersey somewhere.  Yeah, it's right in central New Jersey.  You guys, you have diehard listeners. 
[36:00]
 Central Jersey might do it.  You know what?  I'm going to put you on hold and Rick's going to talk to you.  That would be great, guys.  I really appreciate it.  We'll see what you're about.  Hold on, all right?  It's indication yesterday, guys.  All right.  Yes, yesterday.  Let's go to town.  Tara, you're next.  You have an FU today.  Yeah.  And what's that?  FU, to see you on Apple.  You were at the show the other night when she had her little tantrum?  That skinny little bitch.  You know, some of us make our money and we don't get it from mom and dad.  So when she sings five songs and then goes off, like, come on.  Yeah, a way to take care of your fans.  I mean, most of us, we don't have a lot of money to throw around to get around to get  around to get around to get around to get around to get around to get around to get around  to get around to get around to get around to get around to get around to get around to get  around to get around to get around to get around to get around to get around to get around  to get around to get around to get around to get around to get around to get around  to get around to get around to get around to get around to get around to get around  to get around to get around to get around to get around to get around to get around

 is mine  He's got some  the wife Claire Uxtable on the Cosby show in the 80s  and the US Postal Service has put out a stamp  commemorating the Cosby show  for Phil Farnswell  so that means everyone could lick the Cos  everyone can now lick the Cos without the Cos getting in trouble  you see, I see 
[47:00]
 because as you remember yesterday a girl claims I tried to grab her hand  and stick it down the Cos's pants  to play what's in the Cos's pants  what's in the Cos's pants  right  looks like a snake peeking its head out of a pool rack full of afro hair  white afro hair, got a little gray  Phil Farnswell  yes  the interesting thing about the Cosby stamp  is that the Cos himself makes his own adhesive for the stamp you see 
[47:30]
 the continuous line of 20 year old girls putting their hands down the Cos's pants  stickier than jello pudding down there  Phil Farnswell  stamp shows the living room of the Uxtable house  well they fit a lot of stuff on this little stamp huh  it's the entire living room of the Uxtable house 
[48:00]
 the couch where little Rudy sat with her little mustache  the stairway that Theo would come down and I teach him about  how to get girls to put their hands down your pants like your father  feels good though gooey  we're gonna do Phil Farnswell  suck my Huxtable  on the stamp it has got the couch remember the memorable couch of the Cosby show 
[48:30]
 where I first sat with Felicia Rashad as we was kissing and I whipped it out and just said hey  what are we gonna do about this  J Moore joke from yesterday  Phil Farnswell from Farnswell  that's a good call back from yesterday Cosby  what are we gonna do about this  Phil 
[49:00]
 so are you denying these uh these charges there Mr. Cos  deny deny deny all the charges from the 20 year old chippy that said  I tried to stuff her hand down the front of my pants  I tried to stuff my hand down the front of her pants  she was down there big pool right for April hearing her too  yeah more filth  Farnswell young actresses say the darnedest things huh 
[49:30]
 she wanted to touch fat Albert that's what I call them down in my pants fat Albert  girl Phil from Farnswell  bigger fat like a tuna can  hey Cos you're just not getting it with your wife Camille anymore or what you have to  my wife Camille couldn't get wet in the rain forest  the Cos is 60 years old so is Camille  yeah and the Cos needs something a little younger  well what's the problem with Camille when she's naked 
[50:00]
 oh my god that's not even funny  her her filth and Farn and filth  Farn is disgusting  it's disgusting  it's dry dry dry big camel toe  she got a big look here it is hello hey Camille look I'll give you a tour of Camille's game  hello look it's little Rudy here comes little Rudy 
[50:30]
 there's Theo and the other kids I can't remember the names of her  Phil Farn  and here come fat Albert  as the Cos begins running out of Camille's big game  that was the Cos' bonus 
[51:00]
 now put your hand down the Cos' pants  now with me  Phil's gonna be a new Cosby stamp  yeah seems that way  seems that way  lick my stamp  I think I just broke a tooth

[57:30]
 work and he should be home pretty soon yeah and what I wanted to do for him was surprise him with  a really great night of sex but also to do anal you're taking the big step huh well we tried it  once and it was a little bit painful for me and I didn't know if you guys had any tips that maybe  you've used in the past that maybe I could let him know because he's probably listening right now  or maybe you might be able to you've tried it before yeah it didn't really work out the entire 
[58:00]
 way what was the problem it hurt okay terrific it hurt yeah it was just I just didn't know if there  was just some way that you guys knew or just like making it feel a little bit better I know it's  gonna well are you uh lubricating or anything yeah we use that but I have a lot myself so  yeah see that's you know I think you gotta work yourself up into a froth yeah absolutely I  suggested drink a like a gallon of wine any booze is any booze coming into play get some of that 
[58:30]
 cheap box wine oh of course there's always wine the wine in the box the six dollar box yeah yeah  the expensive one and and what is what is he uh doing is he just kind of climbing aboard and uh  going to town well you know the whole floor play business first but no I mean right at the point  you know where he's ready to go I mean does he uh is he gentle yeah he is he doesn't just like you  know plunge into it or anything have you have you tried like a shoehorn is he a big man uh bigger 
[59:00]
 than average yeah maybe you just need different lubricant maybe that could help you know  so what happens is just hurting a lot yeah it was just it was just it got to a point where there  was just this one part like yo and you know then it was like okay I can't do this right now a little  resistance yeah maybe you're not relaxing enough maybe you're clenching up yeah that's why you gotta  get a little more relaxed a little more wine yeah you pretty much just just gotta suck it up you're 
[59:30]
 almost there you're almost there take the pain take the pain and I was wondering you guys if um I  could also maybe play the game uh which one uh what's down with him you know we played a lot this  way yeah call call back like that's one of our our new bits that we don't want to burn out  oh is there another game I could play because I was hoping maybe there was some wwf tickets  because I'm a huge fan oh really um yeah it's uh can I fit a phone in my uh no yeah we don't have 
[60:00]
 wrestling tickets till later on today oh what time I'm not sure in about an hour any gift certificates  of Piedana hey are you uh are you going to be doing the anal before the end of the show  um probably not probably about seven oh damn I know he doesn't get out of work till seven  hmm we'd love to have him on the phone while he tries I would hear that I wouldn't mind guys I 
[60:30]
 Billy do you have a bed post uh no no bed post no that's too bad that would be great have you  guys seen the video the bed the bed I'm ready uh my boyfriend's gonna attempt right now I don't  think we should have a problem I'm pretty lubricated  well no chance of getting a ticket either well there's a lot of guys that want to give you advice  on on how to take it okay I don't know this could get ugly all right we'll try one and see where it

[65:30]
 turn on your side okay and that that is what I found to be about the most enjoyable for you  some of the other ways can be incredibly painful all right Mary Mary can I give you anal sex  okay  Mary I need anal Mary I've already asked Mary  and Lou Lou Lou won't give me anal I'm leaving okay bye thank you thank you how about I just bend

[66:30]
 a pro okay terrific if I gotta pick that up yeah um you can pick that up analese yeah popular item  it is it's great stuff yeah then I'll bunch of it I think it's a little better if the girl goes  in and makes the purchase though tell you the truth I need analese please Mr. Pharmacist could  I get some analese please it's for me Murray and Lou I wonder if they have uh fisties 
[67:00]
 sorry just have them put a little bit on this finger like all right we yeah we know how to apply  uh no because you put it on the guy all right all right all right all right what  yeah if you put it on the guy it'll numb him oh yeah yeah so you don't want that so oh it's  supposed is it like a numbing agent too and a lubricant that's what you want yeah that's what  you want in in love making something that'll numb the pain kind of like novicate I know that the 
[67:30]
 fuel blow to lubricate that's what you want and then once you're there and actually uh in the act  of anal sex I know there's some kidney punches you do make a clinch up and it feels good and  then that is after press charges if you punch them hard so remember anal tips drink a lot  don't fight back bite the pillow and bleed a lot all right thank you Mike Tyson yeah if you all 
[68:00]
 right Holly thank you good luck wishing each other well in the wonderful world of anal it's like a  novocaine for the butt yeah I wonder if you get like you know when you go to the dentist and your  lips get all numb and droopy same thing it's just a different type of drilling  go ahead rinse 
[68:30]
 Valerie what's going on Dawn has to lay on her stomach right on her stomach now we've  you guys you guys have all suggested on lay on the stomach lay on the back lay on the side  do it all fours she's got a first lay on her stomach so it's completely in then get on all fours  oh yeah oh there's a move when it's uh that's wonderful you see it to go in when you are your  stomach and you enjoy it more when you're on all fours all right thank you Valerie thanks okay I 
[69:00]
 think we'll do one more be sure the area is based on a lot of rubricans that's how I like my  anal be sure there's plenty take a turkey baster and just marinate the area be sure it's properly  marinated the leather cheerio and lay on your stomach dolls like a big like a big turkey 
[69:30]
 and then get stuffed like a holiday turkey as you base the area of the leather cheerio in  lubricant marinate  and then take the stuffing made of hot beef stuff that turkey just stuff the big fat  turkey that's well lubricated with the lubricant 
[70:00]
 bon appetit with your anal bon appetit  that's right only a properly lubricated marmol and  the luna will be pleasurable to all the people look at the way I enjoy it with my big fat old  ass it's usually best served with a toast solid  hey hey karen you got a fine wine 
[70:30]
 okay terrific let me talk hi guys hey karen you got some advice for don yeah actually  you should just get ky jelly from the drugstore ky yeah that works the fastest  and to uh be on all my jelly or ky jam and honestly if you could just get her boyfriend  it'll be so quick that uh it doesn't take a deep breath and it'll be over so fast all right thank 
[71:00]
 you karen you're welcome proper lubricant perhaps something in a chicken base or maybe some some jam  all right jody strawberry preserve hey what's up jody how are you guys pretty good all right  so i want some advice for you okay go you have to lay completely flat on your stomach 
[71:30]
 okay and then stick your butt up in the air and actually push listen listen uh listen we had to  dump out of that you can't say that sound advice maybe julia child could like uh we understand  the trance advice julie childs could you translate what didn't make it yes let's say you're stuffing  a holiday turkey it would help if the turkey felt like it was to push the stuffing back out 
[72:00]
 push and remember plenty of more and on the only way it works is with more and more  i know i used to enjoy anal a lot more but the men seem to roll off of my hunchback these days  is  you see my boobs sweat socks full of sand 
[72:30]
 well i don't know how else to put it that's okay jody thank you all right good luck filming  this is too funny someone on the instant feedback is suggesting that we we get uh charlton heston  in here to explain it explaining i don't know  i think charlton heston is under the weather this week had old gag melanie what's up hi i love you 
[73:00]
 guys really i just started listening a little while ago but you guys are the best hey thank you  um actually just wanted to advise her astro glide is the thing to use astro glide what the hell is  that the best is that a type of lubricant yes yeah it is like the best all right wow you got  a position she's just got to like maneuver her body a certain way it's just it's weird but  like a big holiday ham makeup budgets look like a giant holiday ham and you're ready to blaze it 
[73:30]
 blaze it make a little target with a slice of pineapple perhaps right around the leather  cheerio and plenty of more  you poke the holiday arm with cloves and cherries just put a big slice of pineapple right around  the leather terio drive away stuff away like a big stuffed pork chop but the most important thing 
[74:00]
 is the most important thing is to have it go real slow okay if it goes in too fast it'll  kill her flowing steady win thank you melanie all right bye bye it wasn't like you cook all of  it take it very slowly you know it wouldn't be good if you just used the whole fist and jones  the stuffing in god no thanks i got the sickest visual in my head right now julian child loves

[104:30]
 bulimia um no you know it's not so much an issue with the show but actually i mean people have  been cruel about it and i'm not trying to be cruel like you i was just wondering because like i mean  it's like seems like it's such a cool show that they do something like that like they'd have you  put on some weight no actually when we were when we did my god dad when we did when we did the first  episode um i had gotten over an eating disorder and i'm like very open about it and i'm like trying 
[105:00]
 to become like active with uh organizations that involve like uh you know talking to girls you know  with bulimia anorexia and stuff like that so uh it's not that important to them all right so they're  not talking about it wow bastard tried to sneak that in didn't he he talks you all up and compliments  it's all right you sure i'm sure okay wow that hit me hard it's like i want to punch him 
[105:30]
 so don't you worry you still got a fine ass thank you you sweat it we were all checking you out when  you're watching trust me watch this 18 how loud it has to be said jason what's up yeah you can hear  in our voices how smitten we are like being a kid toucher that's that's like a mark jason what do  you got here comes speaking of kid touches look jason what do you got for jamie lint yeah i watch  the show a lot and with my dad we really enjoy it and uh i was just gonna ask you that my dad and i

 meadow soprano from the sopranos i've never seen this many guys in the studio for one of our  guests i know matt devotee never comes in here you know what you never come in i had to say hi  there's all the towns in the show where i grew up the hits on tony and montclair and then bluefield  and then patterson i'm like my god this is my backyard so she's a celebrity in my book see we  can't truly relate because we're all long island people in here you're the only jersey guy 
[107:30]

[108:00]
 you don't have a question like how do you how do you all fit inside the tv  as i watch it you look a lot bigger in real life  i  let's see what spaz would ask jamie lind spaz you got a question for jamie lind 
[108:30]
 probably yes the most serious and boring question how'd you get in television because  i had to get in the television i check and i can't find a way to open it there's no little  door in the back because i've been to 21 uh play productions in college so i'm an aspiring actor  inspiring actor okay well that's a good question right i mean that's a good way to start out that's  what i did give me a surprise no i have no connections in that one in that part but um 
[109:00]
 get an agent get a manager have them start sending out that's what i did there you go spaz wow you  got actual uh information there yes spaz do you have a follow-up question usually  no you have nothing left in your head who you kidding  you did great i'm looking at me so you did great on who wants to be a millionaire last night  everyone mentioning that there's a guy i can't believe it there's a guy named spaz  i don't want to be a millionaire last night i've been getting calls about that today oh there's 
[109:30]
 there was a guy i think his real name was kevin his nickname was spaz and he was on who wants to  be a millionaire wow how did he do he won 100 bucks no he got the 100 right then he took it left  i'm gonna settle with 100 regents i'm gonna get out of here you said john is that your final answer  yeah no it's kevin get out of here tomorrow know what we need from uh one of our faithful  listeners we need a tape of last night's show because we could do some wonderful things with  that i want to hear regents uh saying spaz sure yeah all right spaz very good what are you what 
[110:00]
 are you doing now going back to it's a phone here's your phone spaz you want a a peep you like the  he's yes spaz getting a sugar high from one peep i think jimmy yeah he would i think jimmy linds  looking at spaz going he can't be for be for real i like biting my heads off the peeps first  actually you know what i got a comment instead of a question okay tell the guys that write the 
[110:30]
 script in the in the show that new jersey's is not as small as it is portrayed in one minute  they'll like shoot somebody in paterson then they're burying the body down by the seaside  bridge like 10 minutes later you know only matt knows that it's true gotta be fact that the show  goes all over the country people don't really know you know someone in arizona said hey wait a minute  that's at least a half hour drive get there five minutes from there five minutes you're right  at the screen when uh they just took over and uh anthony says uh uh tony goes all right you know 
[111:00]
 uh just give me bloomfield and uh and union and i'm like who's miles between those two towns you  know but i guess nobody's no one really picked up on it no one really showed me okay terrific  okay i don't even have headphones on and i heard that  now taping is uh done for the season right yeah we're done so so you know how the whole thing ends 
[111:30]
 could you give us a hint even i don't know do you know you haven't even told your brother how it ends  wow that's secret it goes on from episode to episode so you don't know you can't tell us like  who's gonna die and why would you want to know i know that would wreck it you should know what  you should do is tell your brother some of this stuff when he's going out and to the bars and  stuff he can make bets and make a lot of money i think what's going to happen here is wow that  was pretty good does any can we ask you some vague questions uh and a vague like uh will 
[112:00]
 somebody die that's pretty vague someone of it of importance  is  she's not talking his name ends in a vowel i'll give you that much  i see getting so much trouble yeah every time we had a read through for the for the next episode 
[112:30]

[125:00]
 the daily news the reagan's nancy and ron marking 48 years of marriage together this coming weekend  how about that and there's a there's a picture of uh the lovely couple in the paper today and it  looks like he's not doing too bad ex-president ronald reagan is kissed by wife nancy on his 89th  birthday february 6th look at his hands they are just leaning on the table she's got her hand behind  his neck turning his head towards her head and he's barely puckering his lips i don't think he even 
[125:30]
 knows what he's doing in this picture where he's kissing nancy and oh my god what happened to her  what i mean obviously never old never a look or anything but oh looks like she's melting  and what's going on there looks like a chimpanzee damn all right no no no but there were some  problems i guess yeah let me read a little bit of this story yeah just a little bit because then 
[126:00]
 we got to get to reagan he's on line six there los angeles ronald reagan and wife nancy celebrate  their 48th wedding anniversary this weekend as the shadow of alzheimer's disease dims the  former president's golden years and damn his motor skills have so deteriorated that he reportedly no  longer exercises and cannot recognize videotaped highlights of his political life anthony ah that's  awful uh former president ford said in a tv interview that reagan 89 did not recognize him 
[126:30]
 when the two met several months ago people magazine today reports that reagan's reagan  appears to be entering the final phase of alzheimer's disease we are afraid he might fall  he walks around the garden and here's the kicker and occasionally mr reagan may try to stand in the  pool the former leader of the free world is attempting to walk on water he had his finger  on the button at one point yeah fought the commies right and now he's wandering the garden and 
[127:00]
 standing in the pool trying to stand in the pool basically trying to walk on water and that's great  the focus of the day is nancy and i don't think it will go beyond the year 2000 is what a few of the  reagan's friends are saying anthony like that's the they think two grand will be the year he checks out  yes oh that's a shame and he didn't even recognize ford when ford visited him recently  president ford yeah gerald oh wait a minute it was sad ford said i was there about 30 minutes 
[127:30]
 tried repeatedly to bring up incidents of our friendship that might stimulate some recognition  by him but tragically it didn't help a bit the guy doesn't remember ford no well i don't think  much of america does either that's not saying much about reagan's alzheimer's i don't think  uh much of us remember all right well let's go ford is 86 yeah reagan's 89 and ford correct yeah oh 
[128:00]
 life and ford was the guy you know falling down all the time yeah and he's thought he had alzheimer's  when he was in office and he's doing better than uh mr reagan so let's go to line six anthony and  talk to the former president of the united states anthony why what are you doing i don't know i  gotta go out here and it it's not every day that the president calls a radio show i drank a lot of  coffee i gotta take a leak see i'll hold my line i'll be right back all right well i hear someone on
