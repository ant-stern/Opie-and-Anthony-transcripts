<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion about the swine flu pandemic, its reported severity, and the hosts' mockery of those wearing protective masks.  They transitioned into a pre-interview discussion about their upcoming guest, Jesse Ventura, anticipating a contentious conversation about Ventura's views on torture, the Bush administration, and global warming, recounting past confrontations with him.  A caller complained about Howard Stern "stealing" guests.  The hosts engaged in a humorous, image-aided discussion about Janine Garofalo's attractiveness, followed by commentary on Anthony Cumia's censored appearance on Red Eye.  A significant portion focused on Vince McMahon's decision not to reschedule a WWE Raw event in Denver despite a conflict with the Nuggets' playoff games, sparking a debate about his business practices.  Previous guest Ben Stiller and upcoming guest Duff McKagan were mentioned.

The show then moved to a comedic dissection of comedian Bill Rayford's awkward stage persona and performance style.  This transitioned into a recounting of a dinner where Bob (staff/regular guest) exhibited erratic behavior, including throwing a tampon at his brother. E-Rock, present in the studio, was jokingly blamed by Opie for leaving a restaurant check unpaid; E-Rock blamed his illness from the food.  Further topics included speculation about Elizabeth Edwards' new book, the Miss California same-sex marriage controversy, and an Obama advisor's perceived insult towards her.  The upcoming Jesse Ventura interview was again previewed.  A lengthy, tangential discussion about French horns ensued, sparked by a caller's comment about Bob's French horn playing.  Multiple calls provided comedic commentary on the instrument, leading to a movie trivia game involving "You Can't Always Get What You Want" by the Rolling Stones, revealing *The Big Chill* and Kevin Kline as the answer. The French horn discussion and the Ventura interview were revisited before the segment concluded.


The next segment began with the hosts reminiscing about high school classmates, categorizing them and recounting various hardships faced by some, including debilitating illnesses, accidents, and deaths. This led to a call-in segment detailing listeners’ similar experiences with classmates suffering severe illnesses, accidents, or tragedies, ranging from suicide and murder to bizarre incidents like a child with a frozen hot dog lodged in their genitals.

The tone shifted dramatically with the arrival of UFC President Dana White as a guest. The show then focused on White's new UFC video game, its realistic graphics, including detailed depictions of injuries and female fighters' breast movements.  They discussed the UFC's growth, upcoming fights, the game's development, and dealing with media criticism and online negativity. White recounted a recent incident where he used offensive language in a video blog response to a false news story, defending his actions against accusations of homophobia. The segment concluded with promotion of the video game and upcoming UFC events, briefly mentioning the next guest, Duff McKagan.


Duff McKagan of Loaded was the next guest, discussing the video game's breast physics and his own kickboxing experiences, including being knocked out. He discussed his sobriety and how martial arts helped maintain it.  In-studio guests Jeff Rouse and Mike Squires shared humorous stage names.  The conversation turned to Loaded's new album "Sick," their tour, their greater popularity in Europe, McKagan's day trading experiences, and his use of Twitter to giveaway concert tickets.  A caller, "Eastside Dave," was mentioned.  The discussion included comparisons between Red Bull and cocaine's effects on sexual performance, and McKagan's discussion of Johnny Thunders’ influence on his music prompted a heartfelt call from a listener whose uncle was Thunders. The segment concluded with a brief performance of "Wasted Heart," discussion of Andrew Dice Clay's sons' band L.A. Rocks, and Jesse Ventura's appearance.  Ventura discussed his book, "Don't Start the Revolution Without Me," his life in Mexico, his views on the Mexican tax system and the drug war.


The final segment covered the legalization of marijuana, comparing it to alcohol prohibition and its potential tax revenue.  The discussion shifted to waterboarding and enhanced interrogation techniques, debating their justification, especially concerning American versus non-American citizens.  The legality and morality of torture were discussed, referencing John McCain and Dick Cheney.  A significant portion focused on 9/11, with a guest expressing skepticism about the official narrative, raising questions about the World Trade Center collapse, lack of air defense, and inconsistencies in the government's account. The alleged August 6th memo, the hijackers' behavior, and the government's handling of the situation were discussed, including alleged threats of bombs on the planes, the lack of a hijacking code, and broader implications.  Disagreements between the hosts punctuated the discussion. The show ended with the hosts signing off.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Got that right, Jay. You got that right.  We don't need no free week. We just do our show, motherfuckers.  That's what I say today.  God damn!  Good thing we don't need one.  Well, because we don't get one.  Oh, no shit.  Yeah, it'll happen.  Well, actually, guys, then we're going to do it with something else on our platform,  and then maybe around December...  These empty promises. Shut up, red flag. 
[00:00:30]  I'm not a big fan of the empty promises, though.  I think we can at least talk about that, because I think a lot of people go through that in life,  where your boss or whoever promises you something way down the road, way down the road...  Oh, way down.  ...to try to keep you a little, like, happy and a little light on your feet.  And then that day comes, and then there's always some reason why they can't do it anymore. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  So it's an empty promise.  I'm not a fan of the empty promise.  Or hopefully you've forgotten about it, because enough time goes by.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I just want them to know we're onto you, so shut up.  That's like the parent saying, we'll see.  Yes.  Like, oh, I want to go here, or I want to do this.  They go, oh, well, we'll see.  Guess what?  I'm too old for the we'll see.  That means no.  Yeah.  Good morning.  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Marnag. 
[00:01:30]  And another person dying from the swine flu here in New York City.  Oh, my God.  It's a pandemic.  Well, we got a...  What is it?  What kind of demic?  It's a demic.  Some sort of a demic.  We got a 16-month-old that passed away, high fever, goes to the hospital, hour later, dead!  Wow.  Dead!  Dead, oof, there's a bit of a panic in this city.  Yeah.  Know what is interesting? 
[00:02:00]  You know that nine Rikers prisoners have it?  Really?  How the fuck do they get it?  Maybe a visitor.  They're contained.  Maybe some awful visitor.  Don't they talk through glass and push their tits against it and go, oh, Billy!  They're pretty much contained.  You're right.  Yeah.  And, you know, even if they have visitors, like you said, it's behind glass.  Yeah, but they still got to deal with the corrections officers and all that stuff.  Ah, yeah, they do leave.  You think a correction officer brought the swine flu to Rikers? 
[00:02:30]  Maybe.  Because you got nine of those animals that have it.  You got two deaths.  But the CDC is saying over 100,000 people are likely infected with the swine flu in the  United States.  And then you get a few people dying from it.  And the rest will get healthy.  Yeah.  So.  Yeah.  It's made a resurgence in the news.  I noticed, like, 20 minutes of the beginning of the news, 20 minutes straight was about the  swine flu.  It's like, what the? 
[00:03:00]  There's nothing else to talk about?  No, not really.  People, they're showing people again with the masks on and, you know, those Asians love  the masks.  Mm-hmm.  God, there's a whole school in New York City, little Asian kids wearing little masks.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Last time I flew, our last vacation, I forget.  Last time, what, flew?  No, no, just flew, like.  Oh.  Airplane.  Oh, F-L-E-W. 
[00:03:30]  I forgot to tell you this.  I was walking through the airport and there was a couple Asians with the masks on.  There were a bunch of people, actually.  Yeah.  And you know how we all kind of talk under our breaths and stuff?  I actually said a little too loud.  Your life isn't that important.  And I got a nice look.  That's the first thing I think about.  Yeah.  When you see someone with the dumb mask on, I'm like, look, your life isn't that important.  Breathe in the foul air like the rest of us and hope for the best. 
[00:04:00]  I mean, on the front page of Drudge, you're just seeing a bunch of people walking around  with masks on.  I don't know where this is taken.  A lot of Asian people.  Asian people love wearing the masks.  What would it take for you, Anthony Cumia, to wear a mask?  To wear the mask?  What would it take?  For real.  Because most of us will never, ever buy one of those masks.  A couple of Jimmy's Gassers.  I definitely wanted to strap one on.  But let me think.  It would have to be pretty widespread. 
[00:04:30]  And instead of just giving you the flu, it would have to turn you into a kind of 28 days  later zombie type person.  Then I would wear it.  Well, then you would just not leave your house.  Yeah, yeah.  Then I'd just set up gun emplacements and shoot the zombie people.  I would get to the point where I don't leave my house before I walk around with a mask on.  Yeah.  That's ridiculous.  Air filtration systems in a bunker kind of a thing.  But at least the news got their big story.  So there you go. 
[00:05:00]  They love it.  They certainly do, Ant.  And all they want is death and destruction.  Don't let them fool you.  That keeps them on the air.  They get bummed out when they start finding out it's contained, it's going away.  No, they want to get that report.  Oh, boy, we got another death.  Because there was a lull for a while.  Everybody was going, ah, this is nothing.  Ah, slide flow stopped.  And then they stopped reporting on it a little bit.  And then someone dies and whoops, right back in the news.  Full blast.  We got a busy show.  We got Jesse Ventura coming back. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, really?  The last time he was in here.  I was a Navy SEAL.  And there's a conspiracy that you don't know about.  Well, how do you know about it?  I was a Navy SEAL.  How long ago?  Before or after you wore a feather boa and fakely punched people.  You can say that when he's here.  Yeah.  You know, I won't.  That's why I'm saying it now, Jim.  I like to see him.  I don't do the same joke twice.  I like to see him fakely punch you when he gets here. 
[00:06:00]  Fakely.  I think it will fakely hurt whatsoever.  His giant mitt.  Yeah, there's a picture of him with his feather boa.  Just have that up when he comes in.  Remember that guy?  What happened to him?  How was anyone taking him seriously?  He had a lot of fun.  He was a fun guy, that version.  He was.  That version was a lot of fun.  Didn't he pretty much threaten us the last time he was in here?  Or little Jimmy?  Threaten Jimmy with a, well, you gotta sleep sometime, I think was the line.  Which meant that Jimmy should have had his throat slit in his sleep by Jesse Ventura. 
[00:06:30]  Which would have been odd.  You could have sued, Jimmy.  I don't know.  For what?  Sleep defamation?  Yeah, sue, go.  I haven't slept since you were here last.  Thanks a lot.  I've been awake for 18 months, Jess.  But Jimmy always has what he likes to call a tranny shield on it, just in case anybody comes in at night.  No?  Nothing?  No, it was funny.  I was tripping over it.  I knew you were.  My tongue isn't working yet.  You fumbled drunkly into the room with that one.  Well, that tongue did.  Humming up, humming up, humming up. 
[00:07:00]  Well, Jesse Ventura was...  Bob Eatman.  Yeah, we'll get into the Bob Eatman thing in a second.  Jesse Ventura on Larry King, just to set up the big interview with the Opie and Anthony show today.  He had a lot of things to say about torture.  That's the big one now.  Huh.  I think he's moved past the 9-11 stuff for a little while, but now he's all about torture.  Waterboarding.  The waterboarding.  Right.  And whatnot.  He's very likable.  Oh, yeah.  And very intelligent, which is a change from our previous president.  I was talking about me. 
[00:07:30]  Get it ready with Bush, okay?  Oh, he's talking about Obama, how Obama's intelligent and blah, blah, blah.  Oh, great.  And he's still taking shots at Bush.  Pretty much everyone has moved on from Bush, right?  Yeah.  Just leave the guy alone now.  Except for the real hardcore left-wing people.  Jeanine Garofalo will still throw out a barb every so often.  She's terrific.  Oh, isn't she wonderful?  I've got her bad side.  Ugh.  God.  She might hit us with her notepad in between jokes that she's just trying out. 
[00:08:00]  I bet she has hairy armpits.  You think?  Yeah.  She's too cool to shave.  Who was saying recently they think she's, like, kind of hot?  It was somebody on our show.  Well, no, I remember seeing her in...  Danny said she's really hot and wants to have sex with her.  No, I said that there was a movie that probably came out in, like, the early 90s, and she  wasn't that bad in it.  Which one?  I don't know.  I'd have to go check it out, but she wasn't that bad.  Copland?  No, I don't think so.  I don't know what it was.  I thought she was cute three years ago.  She was all right in a couple of movies. 
[00:08:30]  You guys are crazy.  When she first kind of...  She was on an HBO Young Comedian special years ago.  Oh, yeah?  I remember liking her when she was on.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, let's see what Jesse is saying.  It's very likable.  Oh, yeah.  Admit.  Very intelligent, which is a change from our previous president.  All right, I'm ready with Bush, okay?  No, no, no, no.  I live in Mexico now, Larry, so I do a lot of reading.  I don't watch much TV, and this year's reading, I covered Bush's life, I covered Guantanamo,  and a few other subjects, and I'm very disturbed about it. 
[00:09:00]  I'm bothered over Guantanamo because it seems we've created our own Hanoi Hilton.  Oh.  And we can live with that.  I have a problem.  I will criticize President Obama on this level.  It's a good thing I'm not president because I would prosecute every person that was involved  in that torture.  I would prosecute the people that did it.  I would prosecute the people that ordered it because torture is against the law.  Shut up.  He's coming in here with that drivel? 
[00:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Christ.  I'm going to get hit.  I am just going to get that big, meaty fist in my face, and I know it.  He likes to argue.  He loves it.  If he was being prosecuted, that's good.  That really keeps our country safe, you dummy.  You know what?  I've read.  And he's going to start all the, do you read books?  Shut it.  I live in Mexico now.  Good.  Stay there. 
[00:10:00]  Save it for when he gets in here, my friend.  No, I'm saying it now so I don't have to say it again.  I have the excuse that I said it already.  All we should talk about is his movies.  Yes.  Nothing topical.  That's great.  You know, you were fantastic.  How was that machine gun to hold in Predator?  Was it heavy?  Was it a prop gun?  Mm-hmm.  Hold on a minute.  We got a very good question coming in from Greg on Long Island.  Greg.  First laugh of the morning from Greg on Long Island.  Go ahead, Greg. 
[00:10:30]  How you doing?  Good.  So now you're standing out in front of Larry King's studio like a pack of wild dogs.  They're taking my guests.  That's where you're getting them from.  I can't stress the nonsense that we have to deal with.  The complete nonsense.  Terical.  Howard actually said that we're standing outside his studio like wolves, stealing his guests.  Stealing the guests.  And we have to sit here and just listen to this nonsense. 
[00:11:00]  We call it nonsense.  Let's say hi to Dustin in Texas.  Dustin.  Hey.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, when Ventura comes in and asks him about his global warming theory, I heard him on another show  saying he could prove global warming because of the thermometer on his rearview mirror of  his truck.  That's wonderful.  All right.  Write that one down, Dan.  We've got to ask him about global warming.  Is it a gag? 
[00:11:30]  Is it a bit?  Is it a work?  I don't know.  What's he doing?  It's a work, right?  Vince is going to hire him back as the kooky politician guy that gets in and hits people  with chairs?  Hmm.  No, he said when he sits in traffic, his thermometer on his rearview mirror goes up.  And when he goes down the road, he goes back down.  But that obviously proves that global warming is real.  No, it proves that when you're sitting in traffic on pavement, that the ambient temperature  around your vehicle will rise. 
[00:12:00]  It's like if you walk, if you walk, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.  Listen to this guy.  He knows it all.  You son of a bitch.  It's like walking on, you know, on grass as opposed to walking on blacktop.  It's going to be warmer, but it doesn't mean you're warming the entire environment.  You got to get him to spit that out because he believes it.  I mean, he was serious.  He was dead serious.  All right, cool.  You could go to a pristine part of the world that is untouched by human hands and certain  parts of it over maybe a meadow, the temperature will be cool. 
[00:12:30]  Certain part over rocks that the sun are beating on will be warmer.  It's just the way it is.  What is he talking about?  How about we start with New York City?  In the summertime, it's way hotter than in the suburbs because that heat's just bouncing  off all the concrete.  Global warming.  It's ambient temperature around structures and things like that.  It's not changing the environment's temperature on a global level.  All right, Dustin. 
[00:13:00]  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks.  And then Jesse had this to say on Larry King.  Now we're into the waterboarding thing.  You were a Navy SEAL.  That's right.  And I was waterboarded.  So I know that at SEER school, survival, escape, resistance, evasion, it was a required  school you had to go to prior to going into the combat zone, which in my era was Vietnam.  All of us had to go there.  We were all, in essence, every one of us was waterboarded.  It is torture.  What's it like?  It's drowning. 
[00:13:30]  It gives you the complete sensation that you are drowning.  And it's no good because you, I'll put it to you this way.  You give me a waterboard, Dick Cheney, and one hour, and I'll have him confess to the Sharon  Tate murders.  Hell of an allegation he's making there.  That's pretty funny, though.  He didn't say the Manson murders.  Yeah.  He, you know, he was waterboarded.  He said it himself.  It's the sensation of drowning. 
[00:14:00]  He's not.  He's alive.  I don't think anybody died during the waterboarding that the CIA did to these criminal fucking  terrorists.  What is with this guy?  Some people just want another 9-11 type scenario, I guess, in this country.  They've completely forgotten what September 12th was like.  They've completely forgotten what it was like to sit back and go, did that really happen 
[00:14:30]  yesterday?  Or was that like fake?  And then you realize, no, my God, that really happened.  Well, now we have to do something so that never, ever happens again.  The horror, the feeling of helplessness that you felt watching the buildings collapse, the  Pentagon get hit, people on a jet plane crashing into the ground and into building, the horror  they must have felt, the sadness of an actual attack on the United States. 
[00:15:00]  People just fucking forgot that.  They just all forgot it.  Waterboarding.  I would prosecute every single one of them.  Shut up.  Why?  Save it for Jesse.  So that they could go back, what, let them all out, let them all out of Guantanamo, let  them all get back and regroup, and attack us again.  That's a great idea.  You have that fucking feeling in your gut. 
[00:15:30]  Where the fuck were you when that happened?  Were you a Navy SEAL at the time?  No, we were in fucking New York, asshole.  We were here at the battlefield.  Oh, and you noticed how he said he was a Navy SEAL during the Vietnam era.  Does that mean you went?  Were you in Vietnam?  I was waterboarded.  Were we really part of the battle, though?  What?  I gotta correct you on that one.  Let me tell you something.  Were we in the middle of the battle?  When you lived in New York City at that point, when that was happening, you did not know how 
[00:16:00]  far it was going.  You didn't know if it, there were stories that there were ten more planes in the air heading  for where the fuck ever.  So, yeah, we were closer to the battlefield that Jesse the body was.  They just, and I'm not just pointing him out.  He's just one of a lot of people that have just completely forgotten what that feeling was. 
[00:16:30]  We need that feeling back.  We need to take these people, maybe take a couple of family members, and kill them in  horrible ways so that they can feel that awfulness that you had, that violated feeling that everyone  had on September 12th and onward a couple of years until people just fucking forgot it  happened.  Ugh, you people disgust me.  Disgust me!  This is a wonderful rant, but you're going to do it in front of Jesse, right?  I will.  No holding back today, my friend. 
[00:17:00]  I will.  This is all just a pre-game until Jesse shows up now.  Here's what, actually, just...  The rest of the show doesn't even matter.  Matter of fact, I would say go away for three hours and then come back when Jesse's here.  No, I'm going to go into the studio and just record some sounds and then go home.  Here's what you can play while Jesse's here.  What?  You're out of your mind!  Get out of here!  You forgot!  Just play it on the soundboard and I'll go home and listen.  Do the one, fuck me, fuck you!  Yeah, so is it. 
[00:17:30]  That's one of my favorites.  I love that one.  I use that one a lot in private life.  How about this one, too?  Are you trying to tell me?  Yeah.  I can't believe it.  Can you do the fuck me, fuck you?  Fuck me!  Fuck you!  And then, it's written this way, so I've got to read it.  Larry proves why he's a great interviewer.  Oh, God.  And finds out what a seal is.  Who wrote this?  Well, Sam.  Okay. 
[00:18:00]  Obviously.  Guess what?  We're going to find out that Larry sucks at interviewing.  And something else is going on in the studio.  Dan is still trying to find a hot picture of Janine Garofalo this whole time.  Oh, I've noticed.  And I saw you go through a million pictures.  Yeah, yeah.  A million videos.  And you're having a tough time finding a youthful, hot picture of Janine Garofalo, Dan.  I've got to find out what movie I was watching.  Yeah, exactly.  Regardless of the movie.  Obi's right.  You're proving my point by the surfing you're doing. 
[00:18:30]  I watched 150 Janine Garofalo pictures scroll by that fucking monitor.  And I love where he's almost confident, and then he's like, nah, and then goes back to surfing.  He'll pop one up like he's looking at a closer view.  But meanwhile, we can see it, and he's hoping we go, oh, that's not too bad.  But we haven't uttered a peep.  Let me prove something to you right now, okay?  You Google image Janine Garofalo.  Now, Google image, once again, Christina model.  Yes.  All right.  And watch how easy it is to find a hot picture of Christina. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, there's one.  Boy, which one?  There you go.  It was the first one.  There you go.  Yeah, but I'm not saying that Janine Garofalo is the hottest thing I've ever seen.  You've said that.  I wouldn't go as far as to even say that I think she's sexy.  I'm just saying there was a scene in a movie from 15 years ago where she wasn't despicable  to look at.  Is that what you're saying now?  Is that the point you've got to?  Danny's at the point now.  It's like, yeah, there was this scene where I wasn't vomiting looking at her.  No, because it was that time.  It was the early 90s.  I had a thing for Kennedy and, like, Lisa Loeb, and she kind of had that same look going 
[00:19:30]  on at the time.  John F. Jr.  He was dreamy.  When you're like Robert, he would get a heart on every time he walked into a kitchen.  Christina model, first picture.  Janine Garofalo, you've already clicked on the 10th section of the Google image.  Yeah.  Now it's showing people that look like Janine Garofalo.  Have the same name.  You know how Google works? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  We just found a fat pig from Idaho that just has the same name.  You didn't like that young stand-up video?  No.  No, not really.  She's got youth on her side.  I mean, most girls, when they're young, you know, they got the youth thing, so they're  not as horrendous as, what am I trying to say?  I don't know what I'm trying to say.  No, no.  I'm not digging that.  It was 1993.  Yeah, I'm not digging it.  She's on Conan in 93.  No.  She looks like somebody, but I can't figure it out. 
[00:20:30]  She almost looks a little like Alice Cramden in color.  She's cute there, though, man.  She's not bad.  She's not bad.  That's Conan Step 93?  Yeah.  Wow.  No, she's...  What, is it a library?  I forgot about that.  Yeah, it looks like he's in a library.  I forgot Conan's old set was so weird.  All right, here's Jesse and Larry proving he's a great interviewer.  I meant to ask you, you were a Navy SEAL, and they have a tremendous image.  Was there ever a time in your life when you thought fear would overcome you? 
[00:21:00]  Sure.  The first time I jumped out of an airplane.  I was afraid of heights.  I joined the Navy SEALs so I would conquer that fear.  Why didn't you join the parachutists?  The what?  The parachutists.  Because I was 18, and at that time you joined the military if you wanted to.  If you were a fear of heights, you could join the Air Force and be a paratrooper.  Air Force?  Well, I was a paratrooper.  Oh, that's part of the Navy SEAL training?  SEAL means sea, air, land, Larry.  Oh, my God, Larry.  Larry goes, first of all, join the Air Force and be a parachutist. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, my God.  I don't know about that.  Wow.  I mean, I...  Wow, CNN, you've got a goldmine with this Larry King.  Like Airborne.  A goldmine.  Why didn't you join the Airborne, you know, and just be a paratrooper if you're afraid  of heights and wanted to conquer your fear of heights?  I understand the SEALs also do jumps, but if you're just afraid of heights, you'd think 
[00:22:00]  you would become an Airborne Ranger or something like that.  80-second Airborne.  But SEAL.  Sierra land, Larry.  How important is the parachute?  When you were a SEAL, did you play honky-tootie horns with your nose for fish?  Well, Jesse's coming in a little later.  The big showdown.  Last time, it got pretty ugly.  Well, yeah.  And I'm sure it will get ugly again. 
[00:22:30]  I've seen him once since then at Red Eye, actually.  He was doing a show before.  He might have...  I don't know if he was doing O'Reilly or whatever.  But...  Oh, no.  Well, he was interviewed by Gottfeld on Red Eye, actually.  And I was on the panel, and we just said hello, and it's pleasant.  Yeah.  Hello, idiot.  Wait, you were on the same show as him?  No, but the way it works for Red Eye is, like, I'm the guest that sits next to Greg.  So when a guest is boarding for an interview, I leave for that segment.  He takes that seat.  No, gotcha.  And then I come back in after.  We saw the show in the dressing room.  Wow.  Greg didn't know what he had in front of him.  The confrontation that he would have had with you and Jesse. 
[00:23:00]  Wow.  Wow.  For his TV show.  How was Red Eye last night, Ant?  Very good.  Yeah.  Apparently, though, I got bleeped a couple of times, or, you know, edited a couple of  words.  Usually with some type of pornographic reference.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That happens.  I guess they're getting a little nervous.  That only means that Greg's show is becoming more popular, to tell you the truth, because  when that show first started, anything went.  True.  Anything went. 
[00:23:30]  We know how that works.  You know, you listen to some of our old terrestrial radio stuff, and you're amazed that it ever  made the air.  It proves we never had a boss.  Yeah.  And apparently, yeah, a couple of lines got bleeped.  It's amazing to me what they get away with on Fox News with that show, though.  It's like, even though they beeped through stuff, but they actually, considering you're  on Fox News...  Oh, I know.  Yeah, that is very...  They're pretty lenient with a lot of...  Yeah, you're not going to see that on, like, CNN.  Yeah.  Something like...  I said pussy lips and got away with it.  Are you kidding? 
[00:24:00]  Yes.  He's so lying.  Look at his eyes.  Of course he is.  I was sitting there shocked for a moment.  Jimmy is becoming a good actor.  No, he's not.  I'm waiting for Jesse when he comes in.  I'll act.  His eyes get like this.  But that's how he looks.  Like the dude in Caddyshack that sees the boat coming as he's trying to do a little  fishing.  That's what it says in acting.  I read a book on acting, and it said, act surprise, and it said in parentheses, open  eyes wide, exclamation point.  That was the whole lesson on acting surprise.  I think you might be a little tired today, Ed.  That one was an obvious time. 
[00:24:30]  Maybe I am.  I would love to play some Hold'em with Jimmy.  Why?  I'm actually...  Oh!  I'm bluffing!  How about a little audio from Red Eye?  And talking about Pelosi.  You know, Anthony, Republicans say they want her to resign, but they really don't want her  to resign because she's so awesome.  She's great when she's hung out to dry, to watch her.  I've seen Ralph Kramden give better explanations when he's in trouble.  I'm the CIA.  I'm the Ed Norton.  She really has no clue. 
[00:25:00]  And about polling, it's like, every time she opens her mouth, I think more Americans  want to take away a woman's right to vote.  That's how bad it's getting when she even talks.  It's horrible.  That was an error, wasn't it?  Yeah.  It really was.  It's something we all have to live with now, Greg.  Exactly.  Who were you on with?  You know.  You don't know?  I know some chick.  Bill Schultz was always there.  Yeah, yeah.  Usually a hot chick from Fox.  But you don't know where she was?  That was some hot chick.  That was it?  Yeah. 
[00:25:30]  Janine Garofalo from the 90s, I think, was there.  Ah, Brian in Florida.  Janine Garofalo was hot in Reality Bites.  Is that the movie you're talking about, Dan?  It could be.  I'm still looking.  He's still trying to find a hot picture.  He's obsessed with this now.  That's not bad.  You're high.  Come on.  She's so frumpy.  Yeah, that's what it is.  You're finding young pictures of her where she's already frumpy.  Frumpy.  That baby fat should have gone away.  This picture's only 13 years old.  She is so frumpy.  Find her at 13. 
[00:26:00]  There's not even a hint of a figure on her.  Yeah, she is frumpy.  And she wears stuff like, she doesn't wear revealing things like where it would show her  ass or anything because you know it's just, it's probably, Quincy would love her ass,  I bet.  You guys were talking about Michael Steele on Red Eye.  I don't even know who Michael Steele is.  I gotta be honest.  He's the Republican chairman.  Oh, that guy.  He's a black gentleman.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  And of course, him and Obama were trading little barbs at the press, little press thing that  they do.  What is that called? 
[00:26:30]  The press, uh, where they make jokes.  White House Correspondents Dinner.  The White House president is a comedian for a day dinner.  We're such a terrible, racist country.  The leader of the Republican Party is black and the president is black.  Yeah, yeah.  It's amazing.  It's, it's, yeah.  But I wonder if you felt at some level the president was mocking some of your attempts  to have kind of a hipper outreach program to African Americans, other people of color  to come to the Republican Party.  No, I, that was, that was just good love between two brothers.  And I, I really appreciate the president throwing me a shout out, it took me totally 
[00:27:00]  by surprise.  And so this morning, I just want to say, what's up?  Right back at you.  Well, that was the opposite of not strange.  Good.  Oh, God.  Anthony, was that as painful as I thought it was?  Ooh.  It's, uh, Obama, first of all, he's not cool or hip.  He's like a grown-up Urkel.  He just cannot come off as cool.  And, uh, the whole thing with the, the brother and, and thing like that, it, it wasn't, um, 
[00:27:30]  no, not good.  Painful to watch.  Exactly.  But then again, I mean, you do see that among, among white country clubbers.  I was more amazed to see a, uh, black Republican.  Yeah.  That's sort of like a UFO sighting.  Hey, J-Ho.  No, it's Swampcast.  Jonathan, you're?  Very, very good.  You know, you make a really good point, though.  When you.  Of course I do.  What?  When you see, when you see black in general, especially when I was growing up, you instantly think  cool.  Instantly.  Until Urkel came on the scene and, and kind of taught us all that black people could 
[00:28:00]  be nerds, too.  And, uh, Obama's a nerd.  Total.  He is a nerd.  He's such a freaking nerd.  You realize when he, uh, when he was trying to sound hip and saying, you know, that, uh,  Michael Steele was in the hizzy.  He didn't even say hizzy.  He goes in the heezy or something.  It's like, it, he couldn't be cool.  And he's a terrible, terrible joke teller.  He is a black nerd.  You so rarely see.  And took Michael Steele.  Yeah, yeah.  Just these two joshing around.  They're just two crack. 
[00:28:30]  They're white guys.  Like they're homeboys.  Yeah.  It's like, stop.  They're just nerds.  Yeah.  Complete nerds.  No one hip gets to that level of politics.  You can't be not a nerd and get to that level of politics.  Clinton is the closest thing to not a nerd who has gotten that far.  Because he's not a nerd.  All he wants to do is stick his dick in anything else with a girl.  You gotta love Clinton.  God bless him.  He's just a pig.  What's that picture with the legs?  Are we still trying to find a teen Garofalo?  That one?  Yeah, I found two.  I found two that I think are. 
[00:29:00]  All right, let me see.  He clicked on the picture.  And I'm like, wait, who's that with the legs?  And I was ready to just say, okay.  That's like a Britney Spears picture.  All right.  You found one.  But no, it wasn't her.  Let me see.  You think he found a lady?  He's trying so hard.  Jenny Garofalo.  No.  That's just her.  No.  She looks all right.  She's cute.  No.  No.  It's not so bad.  Jimmy's sort of with you.  I'm not feeling it.  Yeah, she's cute there.  That's a good picture of her.  No.  She's cute there, too.  No.  That's a glamour shot, though.  He's trying.  From the mall.  Yeah.  From the mall. 
[00:29:30]  But it's still not a bad picture.  That one's not that bad.  But she doesn't look like that.  We're not saying find a good picture of her.  That must have been in a magazine because it looks photoshopped.  Yeah.  A little retouching going on there.  A little retouching.  Thank you.  You said to find a good picture.  I found one.  No, no.  We said find her when she was cute.  That's different.  It's true.  You can find a good picture of the elephant man at the right angle.  You can find a good picture of Ellen DeGeneres.  Extra rock.  You can find a good picture of Ellen DeGeneres if she's in a magazine and they can do all  that retouching shit.  All right.  Slow down.  Find just a basic natural picture of Janine Garofalo looking cute or hot. 
[00:30:00]  We said hot.  Now we're down to cute.  Ugh.  Ann talks about kids being neighborhood spies in England.  Gets dumped out.  What the hell is this about, Ann?  I don't know the story.  Apparently, local governments are hiring children to rat people out for littering and environmental  crimes, watering their lawn when they shouldn't, things like that, smoky cars. 
[00:30:30]  They're taking down people's license plate numbers.  Little rat kids wandering around.  Yeah.  Anthony, I don't know about this.  Recruiting kids to be the eyes and ears of their neighborhoods, I guess that teaches  them to be law-abiding, but to me, it teaches them to be little rat-think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's two words.  Yeah.  I'm thinking that's in their future.  I don't know.  Who can bribe a kid, though, at some point?  Depending on the age, candy, porno. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  I can be bribe.  Candy slash porno.  Or porno, as they call it.  Wow.  What do they dump out there?  I said, Amber Alert.  I was, you know, if a kid rats me out, there's going to be an Amber Alert in their future.  What's wrong with saying that?  I don't know.  I didn't think Amber Alert was something that would, you know.  You're sort of going like kind of mafia, but they're younger kids, you know, where people  just disappear.  It's a joke.  I'm not going to abduct a child for ratting me out.  But if someone rats you out, you know, in some cases, you disappear. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Exactly.  But if you're a kid, then the disappearing would lead to maybe an Amber Alert.  Amber Alert.  Right.  What's wrong with that?  I don't know.  Maybe you can't say Amber Alert in any context.  I don't know.  I don't know.  There were rules.  I broke the rules.  What a weird world we live in.  It really is.  We got more of Anthony on Red Eye after the break.  Oh, goodness.  We got Jesse Ventura coming in.  That's right.  I was a Navy SEAL. 
[00:32:00]  It's going to be a big showdown.  Big showdown.  Oh, God.  Also, Dana White's in town, huh?  Yeah.  UFC guy.  Have we ever seen him live?  I have.  I met him in Vegas, but he's not a name.  He's just done phoners with us on the phone.  It'd be funny if it's just a mouth that comes in and there's no person attached to it.  It'd be funny if it wasn't the operative word.  Yeah.  Horrifying, might be.  Wouldn't you just scream?  It would be something.  It's a mouth.  I would.  It's always cool when you're bombing and somebody else decides to strap the plutonium to their 
[00:32:30]  chest and jump in.  I wanted to jump in and try to save you.  I appreciate it.  You threw yourself on the grenade.  We both ended up.  Now people are trying to send in their hot pictures of Janine Garofalo.  We might have to give up on the bit, Dan.  He's trying.  Look, he's looking.  This is pure.  Chris, he's usually good for one.  Yeah.  We'll see what he comes up with.  Is that the deal?  Let's see.  You put an extra thing in there, Dan. 
[00:33:00]  You put an extra thing in there.  I don't know.  As he tries to find that link.  Also, the studio's set up, making the space feel very, very small.  Duff McKagan coming in and playing some tunes for us.  A couple songs, and we'll talk stars, because he's all about that these days.  Janine Garofalo.  That's about the best one you've found yet, because her face looks thinner.  She's smiling. 
[00:33:30]  She doesn't have those ridiculous glasses on.  And her hair is sort of done.  Her hair's greasy stuff.  No, it's sort of like, yeah.  It's not like...  It's long.  It's not short, dikey cut.  I'm a fan of the natural look.  Enough of the dumb glasses.  You're not proving anything with your stupid designer glasses.  That isn't a hideous picture.  It's not bad.  It's all right.  To be honest with you, it's not a bad picture.  Case closed?  No, I win.  I don't have a boner.  I didn't say you were going to go.  Oh, it's boner.  Now it's boner. 
[00:34:00]  Obi's, like, setting the sights higher, where you've got to find not boner worthy.  And Dan, you just keep setting them lower.  Like, as long as you're not fainting from vomiting when you look at her, it's okay.  I at least want to tingle.  You guys have got to find some common ground.  That isn't a bad picture.  I'll even confess up to that.  But I think it's the angle and, like, two seconds after that, there's a completely different picture being taken.  How funny is it that God allowed her to be hot for maybe one night, and then she went back to ugliness.  For one photo.  For one photo.  And then she had to start going the other way. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  And the second she opens her mouth with her liberal garbage.  I didn't say I agreed with any of her thoughts or beliefs.  Oh, okay.  Sounds like you're all about her, Dan.  Yeah.  I just wanted to finger her back in 1993.  Just diddle.  All right.  Going on a break.  Ben Stiller came in yesterday.  What is it?  The museum movie opens Friday.  Night at the Museum 2, yeah.  Yeah.  About the museum.  Ben Stiller was responsible for 9-11.  Shut up.  God, I can't wait until he gets in here. 
[00:35:00]  Everyone's involved in some conspiracy.  Only he knows everything.  He's the only guy that has this insight.  You try to even discuss a point, an opposing point of view with him.  And instead of just discussing it, he'll try to turn, and watch, this will happen.  He'll try to make it that you're stupid, you haven't read what he read, you haven't been a Navy SEAL, so you're in no position to even argue the point with him.  You're going to say this to him, right?  No.  Come on, you got it.  Crazy. 
[00:35:30]  Insane.  The guy's a bad man.  I've read a lot of the same books he has, and he's just misrepresenting them.  All right.  We're going to have some fun with Jesse.  You know what you could do, Ant, to get ready for the interview?  Duff McKagan soundboard, you could push that closer to you so you have some protection between you and Jesse.  I could do that so he can't.  Start building your protection now.  Yeah.  We'll find some stuff.  We could pile up the couches around here.  You've got to sleep sometime.  I hear him, but I don't know where he is.  You're just behind this wall of stuff.  Maybe when Jesse goes to punch you in the face, you could jump over there and sing 
[00:36:00]  Merzied Oats and Dozied Oats and Little Lambs and Ivy.  That was bombing, and I wanted to stop it.  Oh, wow.  I couldn't.  Okay, faggot.  What's next?  I'm going to remind Jesse that some people never got over their fear of heights.  The people that had to jump off the top of the World Trade Center, they didn't get over  their fear of heights by going to SEALS school.  Well, you could thank George Bush for that.  Yeah, exactly, because they were in on it.  Shut it.  Right to his face, right?  No.  I'm saying it now.  I think you're brave enough.  Once he gets here, I'll say I loved his work. 
[00:36:30]  No, I think you'll get riled up.  He's great, and he's fantastic.  I think you'll get riled up.  Anyway, Ben Stiller was in yesterday, and he surprised us.  We were just kind of killing time, looking at some real good porno.  All right, yeah.  And he just walked in.  Yeah, they just walked him in the door with no fair warning, and yeah, we were perusing  some pornography.  He's one of the biggest movie stars.  And all of a sudden, we're looking at porn.  He's a big wig in the industry.  And we look up, and there's Ben Stiller going, what the fuck are you guys doing, basically? 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  And this is how it went down as we go to break.  Opie and Anthony.  Good morning, everybody.  Ella.  How are you?  Bundabah.  You good?  Good, good, good, good, good, good.  I'm plugging it.  I want to plug this gig I'm doing this Saturday with...  Do you get it?  Oh, that's not nice.  Leno and Bob Saget, it's a benefit for...  Tom Hanks.  Tom, what?  Tom Hanks of Sherry. 
[00:37:30]  Jimmy Gough, for real.  It's a really good one.  Yeah, it's...  I'm just a dick.  It's with Jalen Owens, Saget, and Adam Carolla, and Jeff Ross.  Damn it.  I can't fucking get a ticket to fly to L.A.  You should check other L.A.  And it's my birthday this weekend.  Kenny's, like, shaking his head, like, uh-uh.  Tough weekend to fly.  Memorial Day weekend.  Ain't happening, G.H.  You should have thought of this two weeks ago, G.H.  Yep. 
[00:38:00]  I would love to go.  I don't know.  It said Carolla and his wife's, like, they have land.  And they're doing the benefit on the land.  I don't know where...  And there's a big band playing, too.  Someone said the Foo Fighters, but I don't know if they're actually...  Wow.  If they got them.  That's a big one.  How long would a train take?  Maybe I'll jump on a train.  That's actually 40 minutes longer than most flights.  The Old West?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  A choo-choo.  Choo-choo.  They're actually trying a new mode.  They're always going to get planes to go into space.  Yeah.  Because they'd be able to just not have air resistance. 
[00:38:30]  But now they're saying that the way to do it is to burrow.  So they're thinking of, like, they have something go 20 feet underground and then burrow across country.  Just burrow like a worm.  Sounds like an idea from Ted.  Yes.  Is Ted on board early on this one?  Ted's too tired.  Okay.  He's too tired to think about things like that.  But he's inventing all the time.  He sure is.  All right.  Sam just ran in a great story. 
[00:39:00]  It's in the paper today.  Yeah.  And he got audio.  So this is a good one.  Vince McMahon is such an asshole.  And I mean that in the nicest way possible.  Of course.  We love this guy.  There's a lot of controversy because Raw is supposed to be in Denver.  I think this weekend.  I'm not really sure.  Sam's coming in.  Sam knows all about wrestling.  And he booked the Denver Arena, whatever the hell it's called, months ago, the Pepsi Center.  And the problem is the Denver Nuggets are still in the NBA playoffs. 
[00:39:30]  So now basically the owner is saying, look, could you, like, you know, do the right thing, cancel your Raw thing, because the Denver Nuggets need their stadium for the NBA playoffs.  Vince said no.  So now there's this whole thing.  They don't know what the fuck to do.  Right?  Yeah.  Well, why would he say yes?  Huh?  Why would he cancel Raw?  Because that's, like, the nice thing to do.  Raw is not a nice show. 
[00:40:00]  But they don't.  Raw doesn't own that stadium.  The Denver Nuggets pretty much have precedent over fake wrestling.  Vince has probably already counted the money that he is making by doing that show.  So are they going to pay him?  Yeah.  There's no proviso in the contract that says if they make the playoffs, you can be in this arena.  They need the arena.  Raw's been on, like, every Monday since 1993. 
[00:40:30]  Wow.  By the way, what fucking assholes in the Denver Nuggets gave away their stadium when they could possibly need it in the playoffs?  Yeah.  They didn't believe in their team.  Yeah.  Talk about not having confidence.  They didn't believe, and they're like, fuck that.  We've got to, you know, make money from our stadium.  Not only that, but they didn't sign the contract.  Who are you?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Who's talking?  It's Travis in the other room.  Oh, hi, Travis.  I was frightened.  Are you on the air now?  Yes.  Okay, what are you saying?  They didn't sign the contract until last month, on the last day of the season. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, they agreed to it in August and signed the contract in April.  And in April, they knew they had a pretty good basketball team.  But they signed the contract anyway that said, yeah, here's the arena.  So I know that Vince McMahon doesn't own the arena, but on that Monday night, he owns the arena.  So we got Vince on ESPN?  Yes.  Going after who's Stan?  Probably the owner.  Yeah, he's the guy who owns the Pepsi Center.  The Pepsi Center.  And what's the latest right now at this hour on this situation? 
[00:41:30]  Quite frankly, it's my view that Stan Kroenke should be arrested.  He should be arrested for impersonating a good businessman because he's not a good businessman.  It's not good business when you throw the WWE out on its ear when, in fact, there are no tentative dates, no provisions of the contract that allowed him to do that.  But that's not good business.  And it probably won't be good business if the team and the coach has to relay and rely on the management of Stan Kroenke's management. 
[00:42:00]  I don't like their chances of going too far in the playoffs.  Wow.  You know what?  What?  If Vince's limo blows up and he is in it, at least now we'll have a suspect.  You think it was Kronsky the whole time?  At least now we'll have a suspect because last time we just didn't know who it was.  Well, it turned out to be he did it himself.  Yeah, but at first we didn't know.  We didn't know who it was at first.  We had not.  The special investigators were involved.  Oh, it was a catastrophe. 
[00:42:30]  It was crazy.  But now, you better watch Vince.  Oh, let me tell you.  Because Vince is always involved in some shady things.  Lights are falling on him, TVs, whatever it is.  His cars are exploding.  Now, at least, we have a viable suspect, if anything, should be a befall.  Well, this is how Vince is going to handle the situation right here.  Do you plan on being in Denver next Monday?  Our trucks are rolling.  Tomorrow they're rolling and they're headed to Denver.  There are going to be two events, I suppose, that night at the Pepsi Center. 
[00:43:00]  Now, we already know that this was booked last August.  The contracts were signed in April.  Who made the mistake here?  Oh, there's only one individual who made the mistake, and that would be Stan Kroenke.  A big-time mistake.  You don't treat people like this.  It's just totally unfair.  Certainly, it's unfair to the Denver Nuggets fans as well.  They've waited a long, long time for their team to be in the playoffs.  And it's unfair to not support them as he should.  It's unfair to book our event at the same time that they might be in a playoff situation. 
[00:43:30]  So, I don't speak too highly of Mr. Kroenke's management skills.  How great is that?  How great is it that the Denver Nuggets are going to play an NBA playoff game in front of WWE fans?  They're going to be really confused as they're holding their fake chairs.  At the same time, yeah.  It's going to be at the same time.  I don't know how they're going to fit a ring and a Titan-tron and a basketball court.  Yeah.  They should just...  They're going to distract the players, too.  Plus, they've got to honor everybody's tickets. 
[00:44:00]  If you want tickets to the playoffs or to Raw...  Oh, well, two people per seat.  Okay.  You've got to sit on people's laps and then halfway through when...  Oh, you switch.  You switch.  Okay.  They should just have both of us happen at the same time.  Just put the ring in the middle of the court.  The basketball players got to go around it.  That'd be great.  Who wouldn't watch that, though?  It's just so obnoxious.  Wrestling is going to get the boot, obviously.  There's no way...  I don't know. 
[00:44:30]  There's a contract and Vince...  Vince will probably just roll over and never fight it.  Pepsi Center will take the lawsuit before they'll fucking boot the Nuggets out.  That'll be a public relations disaster in Denver.  Brian has a problem with this.  Let's go to Cleveland.  Brian, how are you, buddy?  Good.  How are you doing?  Good, man.  How are they supposed to know in April that this playoff game is going to fall right on this specific date?  I mean, are you supposed to not book that Pepsi Center for a couple months just in case Denver makes it that far into the playoffs?  Yeah.  I guess what Vince is saying, there's nothing in the contract whatsoever to say, look, you know, you have the date unless the Nuggets are in the playoffs. 
[00:45:00]  Like, the contract pretty much reads it's our fucking venue that night.  But doesn't the...  Isn't there the schedule of the playoffs and everything?  Isn't it scheduled in advance?  No, not at all, because I think when this contract was, you know, put in motion or whatever, the Nuggets, you weren't sure the Nuggets were going to be in the playoffs yet. 
[00:45:30]  I'm not sure about the Nuggets themselves.  I'm just talking about when they do the playoffs.  Isn't there a scheduled date that says the playoffs are going to be on this day?  Oh, I don't...  No, because you don't know how many games each one's going to go.  What do you like?  They change schedules sometimes depending on who's playing.  Yeah.  I don't really know the specifics about that, to be honest with you.  But what Vince is saying, there was no provision in the contract for this, so this guy's a bad businessman.  He's right.  And he doesn't even think ahead just in case something like this is going to pop up.  There should be something like, if in the case, the Denver Nuggets are in the playoffs, you cannot come here and hit the people with the chair game. 
[00:46:00]  Especially if you sign a game, okay?  Especially if you sign it in April and it's, like, May.  Someone's assholes.  Someone is saying that playoff schedules are made in advance.  So maybe he just didn't have confidence in the Nuggets.  You have to at least know it's around this time. 
[00:46:30]  Like, it'll be, like, this week or next.  Jason in Pittsburgh.  Jason.  Yo.  Hey.  The Penguins had a playoff game with the Washington Capitals, and there was a Yanni concert scheduled for one day.  So they bumped the playoff game one day forward, which meant the Penguins had to play in Pittsburgh on a Wednesday night  and then go to Washington to play on a Thursday night.  It caused all kinds of controversy, and the Capitals are saying this is one of the reasons why they lost.  How embarrassing is it that you got bumped for a Yanni concert? 
[00:47:00]  Yanni.  That awful fucking...  God.  You know what they...  What do they call new age now that it's not new anymore?  It's just old age.  It's called auditory cum.  You know what, man?  You'd look really good if Vince backed wrestling out and just took the next week and got some extra money from this guy.  I'm sure that that's what would probably happen.  Fuck that.  No way.  No way.  That ain't Vince.  He's going to force...  No way will that happen. 
[00:47:30]  The trunks are rolling.  Instead of looking at a legitimate sport, they're going to have to wait a day or two while Vince does his fake wrestling show.  I love it.  If they kick him out of the arena, Vince will set up in the parking lot if he has to.  He will make a scene before he...  We're doing our show.  He should set up the ring in the parking lot.  Oh, yeah.  Raw is going to be on next Monday from Denver.  I don't doubt it. 
[00:48:00]  That's a developing story.  We'll have to wait and see.  Victor the Trucker.  Victor.  Hey, morning.  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  All right.  Hey, I think there should be a tag team match.  Get a couple wrestlers against a couple of the ballplayers and best out of three.  You know, whoever wins gets to have the venue for the night.  Then what would happen?  You do it that night.  That way everybody is happy.  Yeah, but then what happens?  How does the game get played, though?  Well, you know, you use your third string players.  You know, don't use your first string.  No, but I'm saying, like, how would they get all the people in for one and then out for the other? 
[00:48:30]  It doesn't make sense.  Oh, it makes plenty of sense.  You know, what you do is, first off, you contact Ted's Emporium.  You get a couple people to bring in some movable rings.  You know what?  That was a good joke.  You guys screwed it up.  He blames all of us.  That was good.  You know what?  That's one of the better saves lately from a caller.  He saved his ass.  I think it was bad, yeah. 
[00:49:00]  Steven asks for Bayshore.  Vince can't cancel.  He's planning on having his ass polished again that night.  That's very important.  Imagine the Nuggets are sitting home with their arms crossed past as they're watching Vince get his ass polished in their stadium.  Polish my ass.  By a guy in a Nuggets jersey.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you know he'll do something like that.  They changed to TVPG, so I don't know if there'll be any more ass buffing in the near future.  Oh, Vince.  You didn't tell me this.  Jake's got more info on the Vince audio. 
[00:49:30]  Jake in North Carolina.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  On SportsCenter this morning, they go back to Vince for like a quick 10-second little quip, and he's holding up a Lakers jersey.  Oh, God.  Yeah, he did do that.  Nice.  Thank you, Jake.  All right.  We'll see what happens with that.  That's a big story.  Yes.  Developing.  So, uh, Red Eye.  Oh, right.  Back to the Red Eye thing.  I heard Bob, Super Agent Bob Eatman went. 
[00:50:00]  Super Agent Bob Eatman went.  So did our own SiriusXM's own Steve Blatter.  He was there, as was Bob's brother.  Why did Steve do that?  Is he starting to be a mortician?  And he wanted a couple of samples?  Wow.  Can you feel the excitement in that trio?  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  They came up and, uh, sat in the chairs there, the audience section. 
[00:50:30]  Bob is a bore.  And, uh...  He's a nice enough guy, but he's a bore.  Oh, my God.  Bore.  Does Steve think it was weird that he was talking left and right, and then he looked  and he saw that himself was in the mirror alone, just looking left and right, talking  to no one?  Wow, look at that.  You're finding pictures of everybody, aren't you, Dan?  There's a picture of Art Garfunkel.  That's Bob's brother.  Oh, I thought it was Art Garfunkel.  A young Art Garfunkel.  Damn. 
[00:51:00]  And, of course, Bob.  Wow.  Glamour shot.  That's good.  Ready?  Let's shoot this fucker.  Bob's wearing a V-neck shirt, sexually up against the wall.  Yeah, he's leaning up against the brick wall all sexually and smiling.  Hi.  Shows off his cheek.  Right, guys?  I would like you as a client, please invite me in.  I cannot just step in your room.  Don't look at the mirror when I pass. 
[00:51:30]  It might freak you out.  Does Bob have makeup on for that show?  I don't know.  His eyebrows are a bit on the dark side.  Yeah.  His Bo Derek cheekbones, though.  Yeah, look at those cheekbones on him.  Wow.  Looks like one of the photos that's hanging up at the Comedy Cellar.  Yeah.  It is one of those.  Yeah.  Like, his name should be Bill Rayford.  The comedy stylings.  Yeah, the comedy stylings of Bill Rayford.  That's like a 1989 headshot. 
[00:52:00]  Definitely.  And he, like, had five minutes of fame on some bad show.  Yeah, he did, like, A&E's comedy on the road once when they shot him in, like, you know,  in the Dakotas.  And staring, everybody, for Bill Rayford.  Bill Rayford's coming out on stage.  He runs out, waves to the audience.  Every joke finishes up.  Hugs the emcee.  The pals.  Every joke finishes with, uh, apparently, uh, you know, whatever.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Well, folks, that's my time.  I've been Bill Rayford, and you've been great. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, look.  Just happy to be there.  Bill Rayford.  Bill Rayford's a fool.  He stinks.  He does.  He wore a fucking, like, uh, he wore, like, the wacky comedian outfit of a suit jacket  with, like, a thin tie and sneakers.  Very thin tie, right.  Sneakers, yeah, looking like, why is he wearing that suit and sneakers, man?  That's crazy.  Bill Rayford's big thing was a Columbo impression at the end of his act.  Ah, I hate to bother you, but, uh.  Thank you. 
[00:53:00]  You've been great.  Yeah, I've been Bill Rayford, and you've been great.  I've been Bill Rayford.  Oh, what an awful.  Comics actually left the stage doing that, didn't they?  That's how you know you're dealing with a nobody on stage.  They go, hey, thanks, I'm Jim Norton.  Take care.  That's, because for years, that's the way you end your set.  You don't, you forget that you end your set with, uh, saying your name.  It's a habit comedian's have.  You want him to remember your name, man.  That's our low self-esteem.  No other performer does that.  No.  No one fucking does that.  Actors don't do it.  Musicians.  Hi, we're Black Sap. 
[00:53:30]  Well, yeah, then again, I guess they do.  So, um, you know.  That was just to get the people to go.  So, so did they bore the hell out of you?  Uh, well, I had a couple of glasses of wine, so that made it a little more tolerable, um,  as we sat high above Times Square.  Mm.  Um, yeah, yeah.  We just talked about, uh, red eye and, um, you know, the industry.  Talked about the industry, man, the shape of terrestrial radio and. 
[00:54:00]  Was it weird to see Bob's wine coagulating?  He just laid right into the waitress's neck.  Little gab.  Oh.  He threw a tampon to his brother.  Look, you get it this time.  Oh, shit.  Make some tea.  A delicious treat.  Yeah, that was, uh, but he kept me out a little late.  And what is he doing? 
[00:54:30]  We were talking for, uh, quite a while up there.  And it was in, in, you know, my hotel.  Uh, but, uh, wow.  Kind of kept me up a little late.  You should know better.  I got back to the room, went right to sleep, but the damage had been done.  And I only had two glasses of wine sitting there.  And, um, and I felt like a groggy this morning.  That wine just fucking.  Wine's rough.  I could drink beer like Jim Cook. 
[00:55:00]  And, and wine just fucking exhausts you.  E-Rock was in the studio.  I just have to tell him real fast.  I, I, I blamed you on the check thing yesterday.  I went back there.  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm not going back there.  Why?  I don't live there.  Oh, yeah.  You didn't like the food either.  We walked out on a check on Friday.  I was, I was telling everybody yesterday.  I went back there and I blamed it on E-Rock.  You did?  Yeah.  I'm like, I forgot his, it was his turn of pie.  Did they know?  Huh?  Oh, yeah, they knew.  Oh, they knew? 
[00:55:30]  I walked in.  I, I felt like I was going to be, you know, yanked into a back room.  You should have just sat at a table and ordered something.  The same thing.  Yeah.  I ordered the same thing.  Oh, they know.  They knew?  Were they angry?  I said, uh, I walked out on a check on Friday and they went, yeah, I know.  I said, yeah, I know.  They were cool in the end, but I, well, I.  Fuck them then.  I blamed E-Rock though, but E-Rock didn't like the food anyway.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I got sick from it.  Did you really?  Yeah.  What was it?  Healthy?  Yeah.  We went over a little spicy chicken stir fry. 
[00:56:00]  You got sick.  Do you think you got food poisoning or do you think you just like, it just a little too strong  for you?  It was a little too strong.  Sweetie.  It was too rich.  Did you go dirty?  Uh, no, but I threw up all over the tasty delight bathroom.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot about that.  My stomach was bothering me.  Poor E-Rock.  Tasty delight rules.  I know.  Let's just put that out there.  That and Popeyes.  We haven't talked about Popeyes in a week.  Papa.  Papayes.  Thanks, E-Rock. 
[00:56:30]  Uh, so, uh, and on red eyes, a couple more highlights.  Ann talks about, uh, Elizabeth Edwards' new book.  Oh, okay.  Right.  That was, uh.  Anthony, why did she write the book?  Was it to punish her husband?  She doesn't need the money.  Was it some kind of therapy for her?  Because she's had a rough time of it.  The book's one thing, but if she wants to punish him, this, first of all, should be on  Maury.  Yeah.  It shouldn't be on that.  You are the father.  Wow.  Elizabeth screams.  He comes with her backstage.  Because I can really see that scene playing out. 
[00:57:00]  But, uh, yeah, probably some kind of a punishment thing.  I mean, yeah, she's rich, but she doesn't need the money.  Yeah, I don't get it.  Let's say hi to Scott in Boston.  Scott.  That was the paternity thing, by the way, with, um, John Edwards.  Yes, yes.  He's writing all about it now.  Yeah.  Uh, Scott, what do you got?  Yeah.  Did, uh, Bob's breath smell like a bag of pennies?  Oh.  You got something in your teeth, Bob? 
[00:57:30]  It's a clot.  He's a nice enough guy, but.  He is.  He is, you know.  He started talking about his French horn again.  No, there wasn't.  I think he stopped the French horn stuff.  Does he play the French horn?  Yeah.  He plays it like Larry Craig through a hole in the bathroom wall.  You know what?  Bob's a fruit.  This, this goes back a few years, but, um, I was having a real problem with Bob.  So I was yelling into the phone, you don't understand what we do because you're not creative. 
[00:58:00]  And then he yelled back, I'm creative.  I play the French horn.  Well.  Well.  End of argument there.  Yeah.  Jesus.  The French horn.  Stinks.  When you picked, when you picked instruments in school, did you guys play an instrument  in school at all?  No.  You weren't in the band thing trying to, trying to be a rock star?  You got a band, uh, outside of school. 
[00:58:30]  If you were in the band in school, you, you were a fucking fag.  Well, you gotta start somewhere, though.  No.  I wasn't cool.  You start in your bedroom.  Dude, I wasn't, I wasn't cool enough to know people in my neighborhood to start a garage  band.  What'd you play?  I tried drums, to be honest with you.  But then, like, the problem with me and drums, um, because I was one of seven kids,  I guess, even though there was up to ten in our house at any given moment, I couldn't really  have drums. 
[00:59:00]  Because it was already just a.  Oh, loud.  It was already just a nightmare.  You know, just, just, the, the house was just, uh, you know.  It gets, uh, yeah, drums.  So I had to play drums on, like, pillows, and then, and then, and then they got that,  uh, that, that piece of wood with the, um, the hard rubber padding where the drumstick  would bounce up and hit you in the head.  They didn't figure that one out yet, but you were supposed to practice on that, but it  makes absolutely no sound.  It's a little round rubber pad on a block of wood, and you'd go. 
[00:59:30]  No, you don't hear shit, though.  You hear a little, little.  It's a tack.  You don't even hear that.  You're not.  You, you, you literally, I can't even represent the sound it makes.  Yeah.  Just think really soft.  Danny's got the shit.  Danny's got that set over his house that, uh, it's electronic.  So he puts his headphones on, and he's rocking out, and I mean, through the headphones, it  sounds like a concert going on.  That's cool.  And in the room, you're just hearing, and sticks clicking together sometimes. 
[01:00:00]  It's not real skin.  It's like a rim.  It's like a, it's like a mesh.  They call it a mesh kit.  It's actually pretty sweet.  Yeah, and, and, you know.  You didn't have that growing up, though.  I gotta thank Bill Burr for that, actually.  He didn't feel like shipping it out to L.A., so he sold it to me.  No kidding.  Yeah, pretty good price, too.  Is there anything better than playing along to a really cool rock track?  No, I hooked my iPod up to it.  It's awesome.  I mean, I suck, but it's still cool as shit.  Anyway, so.  Yeah, it is.  When you picked up an instrument, it was like drums, guitar. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Maybe bass.  Not the, but I had a friend that had the big, he was the big stand-up bass guy walking around  the school.  Ugh.  Ugh.  And then the tuba guys.  What the hell are you doing?  That's, that's too much work.  First of all, toting it around.  When I went to band practice, I had a pair of sticks.  That's it.  Yeah.  Kids are hauling around.  When your instrument has to be on wheels, what are you doing?  Yeah.  If you need casters on the bottom of what you play.  Oh, they're called casters?  Well, they're wheels.  All right.  Well, the casters are wheels, so in essence, we were both correct, Opie. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  One dumber than the other, though.  No, it's just the way it is.  One dumber than me.  We represent a lot of different people out there.  Ah, we try to cover the gamut.  I represent the dummies, and you represent the ones that might have a few more words in  their vocabulary.  Some words.  I try to have words.  Fuck.  Why the French horn?  Thank you.  Let's get back to that.  You ever see the French horn case?  No.  Give me a French horn case.  I think that's what he said.  They're like, what kind of instrument? 
[01:01:30]  He's like, well, do you have anything I can carry in my asshole?  My arms are busy.  Look at how weird the French horn case looks.  What the fuck?  Oh, it's not straight?  It's weird.  No, that's, yeah, you look stupid on the bus.  That is, you're getting beat up if you carry that.  In all fairness, Bob played like an orchestra in, where was it?  He tells us all the time.  I keep forgetting.  You listen?  Transylvania.  It wasn't in America.  He was overseas. 
[01:02:00]  He was that damn good.  And he looked like a young Dustin Hoffman when he was growing up.  Who?  Ria Rato Rizzo.  Don't call me boring in my own goddamn house.  Can I just be Robert?  There's a picture of him in his house in L.A. where he looks like a young Dustin Hoffman.  Hope he winds up like that, too.  Pissing his pants and then dying on a bus.  On his way to Florida with a mail hooker.  He's going to suck dicks at every rest stop to make food money.  It's terrible. 
[01:02:30]  Steven S. from Bayshore.  A big stand-up bass.  Who did you go to high school with, Hope?  The fucking Stray Cats?  I had two friends growing up.  First generation from Germany.  And you would love these.  Ah, from Germany.  Norman.  This is like a...  The Oompa band?  What is it?  The Simpsons?  I'm trying to think.  Norman and Martin...  I shouldn't say their last name.  Borman?  They were twins.  But they had a very...  Nazi.  They had a very...  They had a very German name. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  And they were into weird stuff.  Murderer?  Norman Murderer?  They were into ping pong, as in playing in ping pong tournaments.  Tourneys.  Interesting.  They ranked in chess locally.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And then they were ridiculously good at these weird instruments, like the stand-up bass and  the violin.  And their mom used to do concerts at churches for, you know, the big organ players? 
[01:03:30]  Oh, yeah.  With the huge, massive 20, 30-foot pipes behind them?  Big organ players.  She was like a concert pianist on the organ.  Concert pianist?  It was the weirdest, like, friendship I had, because they were so not American.  Back to Anthony on Red Eyes!  Yeah.  Yeah.  And talks about an Obama advisor calling Miss California a dog.  What's this about?  A dog.  Ah, some dummy.  Was talking about his involvement, I guess, in the choosing of the first dog. 
[01:04:00]  And then made a comparison with Miss California.  I just don't understand the Miss California thing.  It seems so simple to me, but it just, but it isn't out there in America.  She answered the question properly.  Immediately.  You don't have to agree what she, I actually don't agree with what she had to say.  Me neither.  But I like the way she answered the question, and that's how it should be in America. 
[01:04:30]  I agree wholeheartedly.  They asked her something.  She told the truth.  She didn't attack homosexuals.  She just gave her opinion on it, because they asked her her opinion on it.  Yeah.  And she was vilified for it, because it was a politically incorrect opinion.  It just amazes me.  Mm-hmm.  She answered the question intelligently.  Yeah.  But there's still uproar.  Yeah, she did a great job of kind of getting around, I think, the issue, where she didn't  sound like she was being homophobic or anything.  It's just, this is my belief.  Here it is. 
[01:05:00]  Uh, and that's that.  And then, what the fuck, she gets, uh, you know, like she was a gay bashing.  Yeah, you don't agree with her answer, so you go after her?  Yeah.  Like, I don't agree with her answer, but I think she, she, she, well, I said it, you know.  The fuck, well, the fucking Democrats and Republicans agree with her.  Like, this is not just some conservative religious uptight issue.  A lot of Democrats are against gay marriage, too, and, and, and all over the world they're  against gay marriage, and I think it's ridiculous.  They should leave it alone. 
[01:05:30]  But it's not something that just a bunch of, uh, conservative uptight assholes feel.  It's one of those things that the entire world, in, in, in, like, as a majority agrees  on, even though I think the entire world isn't correct.  Mm-hmm.  It's, it's, it just amazes me.  Whatever.  But she, she had the nerve to give her fucking opinion, honestly, and, uh, it's, it's amazing  what babies.  Babies.  Right.  People are.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Despicable.  A French horn case looks like a gay snail.  Well, is that going to be a good visual? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, snail.  He just didn't have faith in snail, so he's a gay snail.  Yeah, he's got to put gay in.  So you have to throw something in front of the snail.  No, we're not that easy.  Uh, so Ant's talking about the advisor that, uh, sort of called Miss California a dog.  Hey, Anthony, this, it's not that this joke is outrageous or evil.  It just doesn't make sense.  Well, I mean, you can say what you want about Carrie, but a dog isn't one of them.  No, no, and it got raves.  Like, everybody was, wow, just laughing.  I thought, I didn't even know until you popped that picture up.  I thought it was, uh, Governor Patterson that made the remark. 
[01:06:30]  You have to be blind to, uh, think that she's a dog.  Yeah.  That girl is gorgeous.  Oh, my God.  I missed the obvious angle.  Yeah, so they're sort of calling her a dog, and she's, like.  Yeah, yeah.  He kind of equated her with a dog, and she's fucking slamming you.  Wait, was she beautiful?  Was he black, the guy who said it?  Uh, no.  Okay.  You said Governor Patterson.  Yeah, yeah, because I hadn't seen a picture of him.  It was literal, Jim.  See, I was just saying it was, you know, a blind guy.  Oh.  I was trying to pick a topical blind guy. 
[01:07:00]  Okay.  Uh, help me out with this.  That's all.  Bill Lance from his truck writes, uh, welcome to the left, Opie.  That's not a left thing.  Man!  I don't know what he means by that.  If the Republicans would get a young, hip guy in there, I think I'd vote Republican.  Simple as that.  I was thinking about it again in the gym, what I believe in, and it all means Republican.  Just about everything.  Yeah.  Socially, you're more, you're like me, I'm more liberal socially. 
[01:07:30]  Right.  I think the government should stay out of your fucking personal life in all aspects.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  I agree with that.  You know, including what you do in the bedroom.  Wholeheartedly.  Who you marry.  Who gives a fuck.  Yeah.  I just hate both sides, to be honest with you.  I think the system's flawed, but let's, uh.  Well, it is.  What are you going to do?  But Jesse will tell us differently when he comes in.  Jesse will tell us how.  Are you getting ready for the big Jesse Ventura interview, man?  How Obama is just, uh, the Lord and Savior that he is.  Uh, how, uh, George Bush is the reason we have every problem that we have, uh, here in 
[01:08:00]  the United States.  And how, uh, it's an inside job as far as 9-11 goes.  And that's why the people in Guantanamo should be, uh, set free.  And everybody that even worked there as a janitor should be prosecuted, uh, in some way, shape,  or form.  And we should just sit and wait for another, uh, attack by Muslim extremists that hate us.  Yeah.  You're going to challenge him today, right?  I agree with you.  You're going to challenge him?  No. 
[01:08:30]  Come on.  We'll build a wall so he can't catch you.  No, I will indeed, uh, give my point of view.  And I will call him out on his tactics that he uses.  His tactics.  I'm not going to fall for his, what I call shenanigans.  Can you do me one favor?  Mm-hmm.  When he goes into his, uh, his, his rhetoric or whatever you want to call it?  Rhetoric.  Just go, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  No.  Why not?  Because he'll hit me.  Nah.  He's a big gentleman.  No, he was a wrestler.  It's fake hitting.  I will.  Fake hitting.  You'll be fine.  Some of that fake hitting looked like it kind of hurt some people. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  One of those meat hooks would really, would sever your jaw from your face.  You think it would do some damage?  Yeah.  He, he, he'd put you, he would put you in a fucking near coma if he hit you.  Oh, by the way, Bruce now writes, welcome to the right, Opie.  So there you go.  Oh.  Nah.  Let's say hi to Kenny.  We got some great, uh, instrument comments coming in.  Kenny, go ahead.  Tennessee.  Uh, hey.  What's up, gentlemen?  I was going to say, Bob Edwards plays an instrument.  He has the fist while he blows it. 
[01:09:30]  To what?  Bob Edwards plays an instrument.  He has the fist while he blows it.  Bob Edwards plays an instrument or our Bob?  No, no, Bob Edwards.  Bob Edwards plays an instrument and he has the fist while he blows it.  No, basically saying that Bob Edwards plays an instrument, because we're talking about instruments,  obviously, where you have to fist the instrument to play it.  Oh, yeah.  Is there an actual instrument?  It's a French horn, yes.  See, that's not Bob Edwards.  That's Bob Eatman.  Bob Eatman. 
[01:10:00]  Bob Eatman.  I'm a super agent.  Yeah, don't confuse Bob Eatman with Bob Edwards.  Oh, well, it's sort of the same joke that they're both ghouls, so.  It is.  All right, so I got to give Kenny a little slack today.  Bob Edwards is just a more competent agent.  Do you really have to fist the French horn to play it?  Yeah.  Yeah, you put your fist in the front.  You lube it up.  So you're getting your own spittle on your knuckles?  Yeah.  Are you?  Yeah, yeah.  You ever smell the mouthpiece? 
[01:10:30]  Oh, no.  Stop it.  Of an instrument?  No.  How about the spit valve?  How about the spit valve?  Of the guy from The Soloist.  Thank you, sir.  Can we hear the French horn, Travis?  Do we have any of that?  I don't know what it sounds like.  It sounds...  I cannot find any French horn music in here.  I've been searching for the last ten minutes.  Dan, see, the master computer doesn't believe in the French horn.  I love it.  The spit valve.  What instrument uses the spit valve? 
[01:11:00]  Most of your brass instruments.  Most of your brass instruments use a spit valve.  I believe certain woodwinds might.  I'm not sure of that.  What's the spit valve?  There's an actual YouTube video of a girl playing a French horn.  With a spit valve.  No, she's showing you how to clean half the spit valve.  How much spit comes out of it?  Another good place to check is also on this side of the horn.  You want to check your main slides, right?  You just take them out.  You pull some of the piping out.  It just starts...  She's shaking spit out of her French horn. 
[01:11:30]  She's cleaning her French...  For this one, what you want to do...  Yeah.  Why is it so twisting?  Remember to take your mouthpiece out, because you're going to dump the whole horn.  Why is it so twisted?  Make a fucking line.  You're like a child.  I love you, Jimmy.  There's no reason for that.  You're playing intestines.  French horn sucks.  That's a great question, though.  It needs the length.  And the different dimension, the slowly growing tube, and that length to get the...  You know, at first, they did used to... 
[01:12:00]  Remember those big, giant, long horns that would be like...  Also...  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bee.  Like that?  Yeah.  They figured they could still get that by just winding it up.  It's actually kind of like...  You know how your Bose wave radio sounds so delicious?  Yes.  It's because that sort of same technology is inside of your Bose wave radio.  There's a whole bunch of tubing that goes on, and it coils, and it moves around.  That's to produce a better pushing machine.  It gets a running start.  Why is it so twisty?  I'm going to play the French horn for everybody. 
[01:12:30]  Clean out your snot valve.  This did, my friend.  Can this bitch play it?  No, she's just cleaning it out.  I want to hear music.  If this doesn't end with her sticking the French horn up one of her holes, I don't want to watch it.  I want to see her play with her anus.  Her puckering anus.  For Travis.  For Travis.  Hold on one second.  I don't want to lose this.  Michukaku.  Talking about the towers falling.  We need that for the Jesse Ventura interview.  Or you rock and work on that down the hall. 
[01:13:00]  Give it to me on CD, please.  You got the French horn now, Dan?  Yeah, I got a French horn solo.  All right.  Because I don't want to lose another instant feedback before we hit that.  Oh, Patty McGee from Jersey Road.  Hi!  Opie, welcome to the middle of the road.  Just go with the...  That's the guy that, you know, you're a libertarian.  Now the bit's over because there's no...  Why, it's a good bit.  There's only three things you could do with that bit, so let's end that bit.  Welcome to the left-leaning conservative. 
[01:13:30]  Right.  Me and Patty McGee.  Ya-da-da.  Are we French horny, Dan?  Sure.  All right.  You ready?  Oof.  What is this?  Sardis.  Someone's saying that.  By Vito...  Look at this ghoul.  This is how...  In this kitchen.  This is what Bob sounds like, pretty much.  I'll bet his wife is plotting his death every time he runs out to the garage and plays this 
[01:14:00]  piece of shit.  This fucking...  This pile of internal organs.  It's just a different world.  Right?  It's horrendous.  Yes.  This guy's head should explode like scanners.  Oh, that is awful.  The only thing that would make us better is if that was a shotgun barrel.  He's playing with his toe. 
[01:14:30]  What's the greatest French horn piece ever?  Someone's saying that they used the French horn in the Jeopardy music.  Is there any French horn where we would go, wow, cool, this...  This is what I'd do.  We lost a listener, guys.  Lost one.  Yeah?  What happened?  Well, he writes...  You were too liberal?  Scary Uncle from Philly writes, oh, good.  The low-rent Hannity show again.  I'll catch you guys tomorrow. 
[01:15:00]  Bye.  More ill-informed rantings from high school dropouts.  Surprisingly, it's not as interesting as you seem to think.  Ah, cunt.  Shut up.  Don't listen.  Shut up.  You're still listening, by the way.  You didn't turn it off.  Go in your mom's room and slip your hand under her sheet and fist her.  Just do that.  Do that while we talk.  And then come back later with your stink fist.  That's a good advice.  You mess.  You mess.  Shut it.  Sonny Ferrelli. 
[01:15:30]  Boston.  Chuck Mangione is probably the most famous French hornist.  Are they called hornist?  Hornist?  I would call them...  French hornist?  I would call them horniest.  Yeah.  Well, they actually wanted to be called hornist.  Did Chuck Mangione play the French horn?  I don't know.  They thought douchebag was degrading.  That looks like a version of a French horn that Chuck Mangione is playing.  Wait a minute.  Chuck Mangione.  A willful boy from Jersey writes, Opie, welcome to just left of center.  Keeping the bit going. 
[01:16:00]  There you go.  John B. from Boston.  Just the string of good instant feedback.  Pardon me.  French horn in the intro to the badly drawn boy song from The Shining.  Wait.  I think there is some French horn in The Shining.  It's a ghoulish, creepy instrument.  Well, fucking find some French horn for us people.  John in Virginia.  Opie, welcome to the wig party.  The wigs.  Where did they go when you really need them?  Well, you know what it was? 
[01:16:30]  They spelled it too weird.  It's W-H-I-G is how you spell the party.  Yes.  W-I-G.  Yes.  And there was just a whole bunch of misprinted flyers and bumper stickers.  Oh.  And they finally said, fuck this shit.  Actually, in those words.  That happened to the wigs.  Was that their official, like, we're done with this?  One guy just stood up in the middle of it when they said, we're going to have to reprint  the bumper stickers again.  And one guy just stood up and went, fuck this shit.  And everybody got up and just left the hall.  And that was the end of the wig party. 
[01:17:00]  That was it, right?  I remember that historical speech.  Is that archived anywhere?  Yeah.  Well, you know what it was?  It was the same day Lincoln was shot.  So it was kind of like the news of his shooting kind of took priority over that.  It's true.  The wigs.  You know, the wigs.  I don't know.  DW, Opie, welcome to the reason why you don't vote.  Oh, I like that, actually.  Uh, the theme from the Sunday morning CBS show, the French horn. 
[01:17:30]  Who listens to this?  Sunday morning.  I hate that.  That's creepy.  It makes me feel, ugh, when I watch that show for some reason.  We got, uh, Tom in Chicago.  Tom.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks, Tommy.  Hey, I think that, uh, the teacher's voice from the Peanuts might be a French horn.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Well, it's Sunday morning.  Yeah.  Yes, we know the Sunday morning.  Wow, I'm in your house.  That's creepy. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Oh, look, we can hear it.  Punch it out.  All right.  That's really creepy.  I'm in someone's house.  We're in someone's house.  Let's say hi to Neil in Seattle.  Neil.  Hey, Jimmy.  Anthony, opening.  If a girl's blowing me, she shoves her fist up my ass.  Is that French horn?  Ah, you know something?  We do have the rusty trombone.  You know we got to play the rusty trombone.  Which is when a girl, uh, puckers up and, uh, and licks your ass while she, uh, jacks  you in the front like a slide trombone. 
[01:18:30]  But if you do it the other way around and fist the ass while blowing, all right, I'm in.  It sounds like, well, I'm not in to do it, uh, unless, of course, you're gentle.  But, uh, that does sound like a French horn.  I'm sure you'd make that sound, too.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Do we have, uh, the rusty trombone?  Yeah, you want to do it now?  Yeah, let's do it.  Trombone, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  You can hit it any time there. 
[01:19:00]  Here we go.  An oldie but goodie.  Yeah.  The low and A.  A rusty trombone is best with a filthy whore.  She'll reach around and get you off with her hand.  All the while, she'll hit your spot by your tiny balloon nut.  Hope you didn't eat too much bran. 
[01:19:30]  A rusty trombone may not be moral.  While I think this sounds kind of gay, I'd rather get some oral with the finger up my butt.  But that's me, what the hell, I'm a nut.  Come on, honey, start the music.  Yeah.  You play that well.  That's so stupid.  That was brilliant, wasn't it?  Not only that, but it was also played on regular radio a whole bunch of times. 
[01:20:00]  And I just did some counting.  There would have been four dumps in that song.  Yeah.  The word rusty trombone might have even dumped it.  Oh, they wouldn't even allow that.  They probably would have.  They started, yeah, getting mad at the words that meant certain things.  Cleveland steamer and all those you can't do on regular radio anymore.  Hey, Ed, help me out with this one.  I really don't know.  Rob in Virginia.  More info on the French horn.  Rob?  Yo.  Hey.  What's up, boys?  Hey there, Rob.  I'd say half of the greatest soundtrack ever created is a French horn, a Star Wars soundtrack. 
[01:20:30]  Oh.  A ton of French horn.  What, like Darth Vader's theme there?  Yeah, almost like the intro, like Vader's theme.  I mean, it's a whole orchestra playing.  Yeah, yeah.  We want where...  I'm sure there's a French horn in there.  Yeah, we want something where the French horn is just completely highlighted.  Yeah, I can't, like, pinpoint it, but I'm sure if you kind of look for it, you can find it.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Yep. 
[01:21:00]  Actually, Bob in New York might have the greatest French horn.  Was it the theme song for Maude?  Yes!  Maude.  No way.  Hey, guys, how you doing?  What's up, Bob?  Lady could die.  It was a freedom fight.  You can't always say what you want by the Rolling Stones.  The beginning is a French horn played by Al Cooper.  Alice Cooper?  Al Cooper.  Al Cooper.  That was a big difference.  Yeah.  That is a French horn? 
[01:21:30]  Yes.  Doesn't sound like the one that that jerk-off was playing.  We got a winner.  Fucking old stones rule.  God damn it.  I saw the...  Tasty Delight, Popeyes, and old Rolling Stones.  What a combination, my friends.  What movie was this featured prominently? 
[01:22:00]  A little trivia.  X?  I don't know.  Casino?  Wasn't it Casino?  I have no idea.  That was the beginning of that movie when the guy died.  What?  That one movie where the guy died, they were on his bureau, they bust over.  You can't always get what you want.  A couple days.  Yeah, but do you remember the movie?  Come on.  You're right there.  You're right there.  I know. 
[01:22:30]  Ant, you got the movie?  You described it perfectly.  The one with Jack Nicholson?  No.  And whose body was the dead guy?  It was a very famous actor.  And that was his whole role because they cut out all his other scenes.  And the only scene they left in was his dead body.  Jeff Goldblum, he sucked in that little race bar.  Yeah, Jeff Goldblum was in it.  Oh, man.  Come on.  Come on.  What year? 
[01:23:00]  It was early 80s, I'm thinking.  Mid-80s, maybe.  Come on.  Is Jeff Goldblum, is he a tube?  Yes.  I was just wondering.  Come on.  Don't look down at him, please.  No, no.  I'm trying to.  They all get together for this guy.  Right, right.  He died.  I know.  They're on kind of a retreat for two days.  They talk about life, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Clint Close is in it.  Jeff Goldblum.  She's in the shower scene.  Yeah, we reference the race shower all the time. 
[01:23:30]  I keep thinking of diner, but it's the other one.  It came out about the same time.  Look.  Look.  Something on the scene.  Mark the day.  I might have finally got you with movie trivia.  Finally.  Come on.  Well, that is a crappy movie.  I don't know.  I remember it as being a good movie, but maybe it's not a good movie.  Look.  William Hurt.  Yes, I know it.  Yeah, yeah.  You're right.  Don't look down.  Cluck.  Cluck.  The.  Hold.  I got to go through the alphabet.  B. 
[01:24:00]  C.  D.  D.  D.  D.  D.  D.  D.  D.  D.  D.  D.  D.  D.  D.  D.  D.  D.  D.  D.  D.  D.  Oh.  I'm going to kick myself in the ass because I know this.  And part two to the trivia, who was the dead body?  What actor?  I want to say it was Kevin Costner, but I'm not really sure about that.  Kevin Kline.  Kevin Kline was in the movie.  No, he wasn't.  It was.  Did it start with the?  Yeah.  Most movies start with the. 
[01:24:30]  Cold.  The Star Wars.  Something cold.  No, not cold.  All right.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  A version of cold.  I know what it is.  Good.  Good.  It's in there.  Good.  My synapses aren't snapping.  It starts with the.  The.  The.  Blank.  The big chill.  Give yourself a B.L.  Oh, God.  That's the only reason I wanted to do that.  Wow.  Very good.  Now, who was the dead body in the movie?  Now look down.  Because we need the answer. 
[01:25:00]  It's one of those dumb movie trivia questions.  Who was.  Like, they show the body, I think, at the beginning of the movie.  That guy had other scenes.  They cut him out.  And that was a very famous.  No, it wasn't.  I actually don't know who it was.  It was Bill Rayburn.  He was.  Anyone know?  An average comedian from the 80s.  Who.  Actually caught hepatitis in his eyes.  Played the French horn.  That's Kevin Costner. 
[01:25:30]  It was Kevin Costner?  Nice.  Wow.  83.  Well, Bob, end of the French horn bit.  You got it.  The beginning of this song with the French horn, there's nothing better as far as the French horn goes.  You win.  I wish we had a prize closet.  We're working on a prize closet, and I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know what's happening with that.  We have literally 20 guys that work for this channel behind the scenes, and we still don't have a prize closet.  So go figure.  Okay.  Because I would give you a fine prize for that.  Sure.  All right, Bob.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Ecstasy of gold has the French horn? 
[01:26:00]  It's got everything in it, yeah.  Opening scene of Fast Times, kids shoving a French horn in locker.  Oh, okay.  Oh, well, that has a French horn in it, but it's not like in it.  It's different.  So now we're up to Tasty Delight, Popeyes, early Rolling Stones, some of the greatest treats of all time.  Tasty Delight?  What was that?  It's like ice cream, but without the guilt.  Oh, I thought it was Chicken Delight.  A little guilt. 
[01:26:30]  Still a little guilt.  Do you remember Chicken Delight?  Sure.  Remember that?  Don't cook tonight.  Call Chicken Delight.  We deliver.  I don't.  That was on TV.  What's that other chicken joint that everyone talks about that's healthier?  Chicken full...  Chicken full...  Chicken full...  Chicken full...  Flur?  No, it's...  Chicken...  Chicken cancer.  Let's get that back there.  And on red eye. 
[01:27:00]  Let's see...  More.  I said a lot.  Guaranteed this is...  That was useless, but I talked a lot.  You were good, man.  You were in conversation.  Oh, I like being in conversation.  No, you were really good.  Overture to Tommy Wright.  That has the French horn.  I saw the Who Man at Giant Stadium when they did the tour with the orchestra and everything.  And yeah, when that started up, and it was just...  That's the Tommy overture, right? 
[01:27:30]  An amazing moment.  Could you find that, Travis?  I mean it.  The rock opera?  Well, they didn't do Tommy, but they played songs from, you know, the rock opera.  That is Tommy.  You ever get the two-disc Tommy CD?  Jimmy does not like the rock opera.  Holy shit.  Two-disc Tommy?  I certainly didn't.  Dude, one of my jobs when I had to work Christmas morning, I think it was Rochester, the home 
[01:28:00]  of rock and roll, their thing was to play the entire double CD Tommy thing every Christmas  morning.  Fucking rock.  It's unbelievable.  I don't know how the fuck he came up with that.  For real, Jimmy.  For real.  For real.  Some of that rock opera shit sucks.  A big one.  Have you ever just sat through it?  Not even 30 seconds of it.  The movie sucks a big fat dick.  But the double disc Tommy thing is amazing. 
[01:28:30]  I'm telling you, it's amazing.  It just flows.  There's a few hits in there.  What's one of the songs from it?  I might like it and not even know it.  Well, Acid Queen's on there and I haven't listened to it in a long time.  I like Quadrophenia better than Tommy.  Yes, I actually like the music on Quadrophenia better than Tommy.  Although there are some songs I like better.  Than some songs that are on the other album.  But I like Quadrophenia better.  Well, Pinball Wizard.  Jimmy's on Tommy.  She's a pinball wizard, man. 
[01:29:00]  Give me the hits from the Tommy disc.  Tommy.  You hear me?  No, we don't need to hear it.  Just I need a list of the songs on that.  Chick-fil-A.  Thank you.  Even better than motherfucking Popeyes.  That's Puddle of AIDS.  Chick-fil-A.  Everyone talks about the Chick-fil-A.  I've never had one.  Yeah.  Bring one immediately.  Yes, Dan.  Let's see.  You got just the...  Well, the Overture, obviously.  Acid Queen.  Pinball Wizard.  Pinball Wizard is so overplayed and sucks. 
[01:29:30]  Fiddle about rules.  Fiddle about sucks.  I don't like anything on Tommy.  It's terrible.  Tommy, can you hear me?  Yeah.  What's Pinball Wizard?  How's that going?  Oh, my God.  You know that one.  I'm free.  It's so overplayed.  I'm free isn't bad.  And we're not going to take it.  We're not going to take it as good.  Was that a remake that Twisted Sister did?  No.  It's just the title's the same, but it's a completely different song.  I want to hear a little bit of Pinball Wizard.  I don't know any of this shit.  Tommy, Overture, first.  For the French horn.  Yes, for the French horn.  I'm jealous.  I would have loved to see the Who do this whole thing. 
[01:30:00]  That was really good.  Did they do the whole thing?  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck.  It was really good.  Fuck.  With a full orchestra, man.  Yeah, man.  I missed this.  I'll come back around.  Hey, Jim. 
[01:30:30]  Is this the one where the French horn kicks in?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Kicks in soon.  Oh, wait.  Here it comes.  Yes.  Live this...  I'm absolutely crying over here.  I'm absolutely crying.  I was by the photons.  Shut up.  Sometimes...  Sometimes you just can't goof. 
[01:31:00]  I'm jealous.  I'm jealous.  I didn't see this.  For real.  Pete Townsend running around with baby powder on his zipper?  Jimmy ruins everything.  Why do you have to ruin everything that could be nice?  The overture is very...  Drums are good.  Well, keep moving.  Yeah.  French horn.  More French horn.  Yeah.  This is good.  I mean, you know, tolerable.  Wait, so...  And the whole band was doing this?  Oh, yeah.  I don't remember this.  You know? 
[01:31:30]  No, I mean, I don't remember them doing it...  The whole thing.  It was on Broadway or something?  Yeah, I saw it on Broadway, and then I saw it at Giant Stadium when they had the whole  band and an orchestra there and everything.  Fuck.  It was really cool.  God damn it.  I'm jealous.  I'm going to play that today.  That was a good one.  I'm going to play the whole fucking thing and drive my girl crazy.  Both discs on 11.  Only good use of the French horn right there.  No, we did the you can't always get.  Dave in Tennessee.  Yeah, the French horn for fags. 
[01:32:00]  Hey, listen, Opie, I love you, brother, but when you say, get yourself some color, I get  embarrassed, and it's like, nothing embarrasses me enough all alone.  He gets embarrassed.  Who wants to feel this one?  I got to tell you, Dave, do you honestly think I'm sitting here thinking that is, like,  something really cool to do?  Yeah.  I'm doing it to annoy the fuck out of my two pals in studio first.  We get the same cringy feelings, sir.  I know, that's why I'm doing, I don't even know, what do you mean, what is it you do? 
[01:32:30]  I don't know, give yourself a bill.  That's why it works.  How does it go?  Okay.  But I don't want you to think I'm sitting here thinking, oh, wow, this is my new catchphrase  or something.  I'm doing it to be annoying as fuck.  Do you understand now, sir?  No, because you don't understand.  I think we're the only radio show that really tries to annoy our listeners.  Sometimes you're annoyed just because, you know, the show is trying to be something and  it bothers you, but we openly try to annoy the fuck out of you. 
[01:33:00]  No, and that's why I love it, because you're honest, and you've been annoying me successfully  for four years.  I just, I have to ask him, though.  Now do you understand?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, give yourself a bail.  It's fine.  Give yourself a bail.  Those heads are fucking out.  That's fun.  And it's just a takeoff on the cheese head thing.  That's all it is.  Of course.  I'm just reworking it.  Oh, cheese head.  Or do it, cheese head.  And on Red Eye, we'll eventually get through all these clips.  We literally had three minutes while you... 
[01:33:30]  Wow.  Ant talks about plagiarism in the New York Times.  I think he gets dumped again.  Why?  Now this is Maureen...  Daud.  Daud.  Daud.  And she had to admit that she stole some shit from a blogger?  Yep.  Yeah.  And of course she made it...  A goddamn blogger.  Because the guy said, except she changed one thing, you know, being the, you know, of  course she works for the fucking Times, I think, right?  That's where she's at.  And then her excuse was she didn't steal it from the blog.  See, her friend read the blog.  And then her friend conveyed to her what she read on the blog without telling her she read 
[01:34:00]  it on a blog.  And then she wrote it in her column.  Still without saying, a friend told me.  What a bore.  And then saying that.  So she didn't credit them either.  There's one line where it says, the blogger wrote something about when we were trying  to find out information on 9-11, meaning we, the collective we, as a country.  But she said, the bush crowd.  Instead of we, she changed it to the bush crowd.  Throw that in.  That's it, you dopey bitch.  Steal something else.  Thief. 
[01:34:30]  Hey, Anthony, big deal, not a big deal?  I kind of got to stay out of this one.  For my show, I plagiarized barelylegal.com.  But you know what?  And totally played it off like it was my own literature.  It's actually a fair point that you're making in kind of a vile manner, which we don't approve  of.  Because of the new web culture, people are just lifting from everywhere.  That got through.  That got through.  Yeah.  I think Sam thought you had a second example. 
[01:35:00]  Sam's an idiot.  He really is.  He's a boob.  Let's fire him.  What a maroon.  He thinks everything's going so well for himself.  Wouldn't that be great to just fire him?  He'd be like, but I'm doing good.  I'm doing...  And it's like, welcome to fucking radio.  Right.  You finally got your last lesson.  You're a graduate now.  Everything's going great.  You're successful.  You're doing well.  Now get the fuck out.  There.  Now you know how radio works.  Did I ever tell you what Mark Cronin told me back in the day? 
[01:35:30]  Mark Cronin?  When I was delivering pizzas.  When I thought I was doing a radio.  Zoix.  I worked for a radio station.  My job was to deliver pizzas.  You figure it out.  Yeah.  And he sat me down.  He's from Rochester.  But for some reason, he had to speak in a real deep Canadian accent, which I can't do.  And he's like, buddy boy, just want to let you know, you're not in radio until you officially have been fired.  That was his advice.  He actually sat me down to tell me this.  We are deeply entrenched in radio then.  Yeah.  Woof.  But that was his little thing. 
[01:36:00]  So maybe we should fire Sam so he's officially in radio.  He thinks he's making some headway on the show.  He's all happy.  That really seemed to like me.  Yeah.  Bye.  Yeah.  You take his ID and you fucking, you cut the string and take his ID.  Good day, sir.  But I, good day.  And have him leave.  Just temper it out.  And thank you to James S. from Riverhead.  You would love the whole Tommy thing because they got Uncle Ernie in there.  It was very similar to Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul. 
[01:36:30]  He fiddles about.  He fiddles about.  Fiddles about.  Well, you know, Pete and I used to trade emails.  We were doing research for a book.  He was a dirty birdie.  Yeah.  Pete never had anything really good though.  He would always go to me, Paul, you got anything for me?  Ugh.  Yeah.  I'm disgusted with Uncle Paul.  Why?  I don't know what it is.  It's so creepy like.  Trying to tell you something.  Not even the material, your voice. 
[01:37:00]  Well, that's the way I talk.  I can't help it.  My teeth are rotten.  Not like Spock talking over his dentures.  I know.  Your destiny is.  I got a right.  Is that in the new movie?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, no.  I'm slow.  Yeah.  No.  Are you serious?  You will.  You know, Spock has a pivotal role in the movie.  Oh, no.  Yet it's limited.  It's not like he's on screen a lot. 
[01:37:30]  But it's a very, you know, important part.  But when he is on screen talking, it is very difficult to get over him talking over those  dentures in his face.  Oh, no.  Really?  That's going to ruin the movie for me.  You must get back to the Enterprise.  You must not say that you've met me.  It's fucking the year, what, 2300?  How about some fucking dentu cream? 
[01:38:00]  Because his teeth are too white, too.  Yeah.  They're pearly white.  They're way too white for the setting.  And Spock now, in real life, looks like Spock did with the makeup on when he died in the  Rathacon, when he shoved his face in the radiation.  Classic.  It's your density.  Your density.  Yes.  Oh, those choppers.  Do you have any efferent on the Enterprise?  Is it bad, Jimmy?  Efferent.  It's fucking horrendous.  Is it really bad? 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Oh, I can't wait.  When he's talking, it's just awful.  A fence in his mouth.  A fence.  Look, it's my birthday this weekend.  Someone give me two goddamn...  Happy birth.  Not yet, Jimmy.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Not yet.  But someone give me two goddamn IMAX tickets to see Star Trek today.  Today.  I want it today.  All right, kiddo.  All right.  I do a birthday week.  I'm in the middle of my birthday week.  Get me Star Trek IMAX tickets today.  Yeah, birthday week. 
[01:39:00]  Front and center, too.  You want to have a whole week?  No, not really.  Oh, I thought you were going to do a whole I'm very important week thing.  No, I'm not that important.  Aw.  I already know that.  It'd be fun.  I curse Mike, though.  Mike Williams from Delaware.  I curse you.  Chick-fil-A with waffle fries.  Damn it!  Is that good stuff?  No.  What do you think?  Sounds good.  Fuck.  God damn it.  And I do want to acknowledge that Jed B. from Connecticut hit it on the head.  Your friends were nerds, Opie. 
[01:39:30]  Ha ha.  And you were a nerd.  I do believe I was a nerd growing up.  I didn't want to be a nerd.  I wanted to be the cool kid.  A nerd?  Were you a nerd?  Yeah.  Where did you fall?  There was a portion of my life where I was a nerd until I found...  Yeah, the first 46 years.  Ha ha.  Yes.  I still have a lot of geek and nerd in my personality, but the truth of the matter is,  when I was a child, I was very nerdy.  I was very much into science, very geeky.  And then I found marijuana. 
[01:40:00]  Nice.  And turned into a stoner guy that was, you know, irresponsible, but very funny, so people  liked me in school.  I was a nerd without the geek.  No geek?  Not really.  Just nerd?  Nerd with...  You gotta be nerd with geek.  Just nerd is...  I know, but I'm being honest.  I was the geek part of the nerd thing.  I was like, what's his name in that Hughes movie, John Hughes movie, where he's showing  the panties in the fucking bathroom? 
[01:40:30]  Oh, yeah.  The woodsman?  He was nerdy, yeah.  But I was like...  But he got the chick at the end of the movie, and the Rolls Royce.  Yeah, I didn't get a Rolls Royce.  No.  I was like a...  Or the chick.  This is gonna sound stupid, but I was like a cool nerd.  But I wasn't in the cool category.  I wanted to always be...  You were cool among the nerds?  Yeah.  All right.  But that's not saying much.  No, it's not.  Healthy age patients.  Exactly.  Because you're still in the nerd category.  I always wanted to be, like, with the cool, like, kids, but I never really made the  jump. 
[01:41:00]  But as far as the nerds go, I was like the leader.  I was like the cool nerd.  You know what I'm saying?  I know what you're saying.  And I'm not trying to give myself a compliment.  It still sucks.  Oh, yeah.  You were king of the nerds.  I kind of...  I really did kind of just...  I was very neutral.  Like, I was a nerd geeky guy, and I was friends with some of them, but I also hung out with  the stoner guys and a few of the jocks.  Like, I never got beat up by the jocks or anything like that.  And I think that was because, you know, I was always fucking making jokes and shit. 
[01:41:30]  You know, we were very similar.  Safety mechanism.  Because I was on the line with so many different groups.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Never committing to one.  No.  I committed most to the army jacket wearing in the back of the school, like in the back  hall of the school where you'd smoke cigarettes and weed out back.  And those guys were like my friends.  I was on the fringe of so many of these groups in high school.  Because I played a lot of sports, so I was in that circle, but sort of on the outside. 
[01:42:00]  And then I was friends with a kid in junior high that was this real, just nerd, complete  nerd.  He'd come in every day and talk about, like, the Nixon Watergate hearings or something.  He was like coming in and talking about how great.  Did you hear what Judge Sirica said today as far as the Nixon Watergate thing?  And I'd talk with him and stuff.  I'm like, oh, yeah, really?  And then he would proceed to just get pummeled by the jocks. 
[01:42:30]  And I would stand there.  You know, he was kind of a friend of mine, but I was powerless to do anything.  I felt bad.  I couldn't save him.  So I just kind of walked away as he got beat up.  He's probably worth $300 million today.  Oh, absolutely.  Of course.  Absolutely.  Did you have friends that you didn't acknowledge in school, but they were actually really  cool to hang out with outside of school, but you knew it just wouldn't look good?  Yep.  So you would see him and you would sort of say hi, but barely.  It's like the Breakfast Club, man. 
[01:43:00]  But you would kind of give a nod, like, all right.  Yeah.  You know, we'll play after school, you know, but in school, you're not going to help my  status whatsoever.  In school.  So I can't acknowledge you.  Can't talk to you at school.  But they were great to hang out with for whatever reason.  I was usually geeky or nerdy.  Yeah.  You know, you can't get in trouble hanging out with the stoner kid.  No.  You know, no one's going to say, oh, what are you doing?  No, yeah.  The popular ones.  But it's the weirdos.  The weirdos. 
[01:43:30]  And then there were the, there were levels of weirdos.  Like, geeks.  A geek is at the point where you can deal with them.  But there's various levels of geekdom.  And then it gets into the weirdo category.  And those were the people like, like Napoleon Dynamite and shit that would walk around school  and you just, no one talked to them because they were just fucking weird.  Or the 12 year old that was in 12th grade.  Yeah.  But that's like smart weird.  So there was almost a jealousy thing.  It was the people in the cafeteria that ate alone with their head buried in their lunchbox, 
[01:44:00]  looking around and just real strength, putting tots in their pockets.  But it was just the weirdo people that you didn't hang out with.  We had a girl in a wheelchair.  What's that?  Oh, shit.  Who, watching her eat lunch was the most horrendous thing you could ever see in your life.  Really?  Which you have, like CP, MS?  What initial did you need?  And some, some, some, some God curse.  Yeah.  Just horrendous.  Like she couldn't like control nothing. 
[01:44:30]  And just eating was a major effort with a lot of drool and just spit and just like things  flying everywhere.  And she was.  Put them in a different room while you're eating.  And she was brilliant.  Yeah.  Fucking brilliant.  What else do they have to do?  Not fucking or.  But the lunch thing, I even remember, like in school, you're, you're way more of a dick,  but I even remember feeling sorry for her as a, as a kid in high school. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  And, and kids in high school don't feel sorry for nothing.  But this, this, it was such an effort for her to eat.  I was like, oh my God.  You have a dying cancer kid?  You ever have a dying cancer kid?  No, I had, uh, no.  That's a treat.  We had, uh, we had, uh, one of them.  We had a couple shaved heads, but they made it.  They made it?  Yeah.  I was at the, I was at the point in school, I guess I, there's that,  fine line where I was there where it was just like death sentence.  You had.  Oh, they would put leeches on you, I guess.  And so he didn't come back after the summer? 
[01:45:30]  Uh, no, it was one of those during the school year kind of went away and then just never  came back.  And then we, we got the news over the public address system.  Ugh.  But, uh, sit there and even then I would think like, why, why are you bothering going to  school?  No shit.  I understand maybe you just want to be a normal life or something, but Jesus Christ, go roll  yourself up Mount Everest or something.  Wouldn't you be getting hookers and stuff?  Yeah.  Trying every type of drug possible?  Yeah, yeah.  If I knew it didn't harm me, I would, I would try every drug possible.  No problem.  Yeah.  Dying kid was depressing. 
[01:46:00]  Did you have train guy?  Hit by train?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Um, I had train guy.  Oh yeah.  It was called trainee.  As a matter of fact, there was a guy named trainee that was hit by a train.  He died though, right?  And no, no, he was alive.  He was retarded.  Our train guy died.  Wow.  He got brain.  No, ours had brain damage.  He was hit by a train before I ever knew him.  No, I'm talking about lady guy's husband.  I'm talking about knowing the kid on the school bus.  Wow.  And then no clue that he had ever had any issues. 
[01:46:30]  And then, yeah.  I had sump drowning, kid.  Really?  Yeah.  During the summer.  And one of the sumps here on Long Island, you got a lot of those sumps in the development.  They just dig giant craters in neighborhoods.  And that's where all the flood water goes from the streets.  And in the summer, it was raining.  These things would fill up and kids would go down there and make little improv boats and things like that.  How did he die?  He drowned.  He fell out of one of his little boats. 
[01:47:00]  They were probably, you know, stoned or something.  And then he drowned.  Wow.  Couldn't get out of the sump and drowned, kid.  Did you have, oh, there's one I had.  I like this playing fucking, like, trading card death.  I know.  I had two.  Got him.  Car accident we all had.  Car accident.  Car accident.  Oh, dime a dozen.  That's like whatever.  Dime a dozen.  Molested by his father, kid.  Anybody have that one?  Wow.  No.  Raise your hand, Jimmy.  That wasn't me.  If you didn't know him, perhaps you should look in the mirror. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, two more.  Falling through the ice, guy?  No.  Wow.  That's a biggie.  Yep.  Never had falling through the ice, kid.  Millpond.  Really?  Dead.  Yeah.  Seven days.  I'll get you.  I had a...  Oh, Danny?  I had bone marrow transplant, kid.  Oh, how'd that work out for him?  Not good.  Oh, shit.  Did I?  Yeah.  Oh.  Really?  We had horrific car wreck, kid.  A lot of car wrecks and stuff, but this was the Ortega Highway, which I talk about in  California. 
[01:48:00]  It's just a windy, snaky road.  Very horrible with just cliffs on it and big Conrock cement trucks coming up the other  way.  And they were in a hatchback, like a Pino or something like that.  And, of course, not wearing seatbelts.  And a couple of the kids got thrown out before the car went off the ravine.  And one kid was in the back.  The hatch opened.  He was getting thrown out, and then it slammed down on his arm and caught him.  And he tumbled down the ravine with the car, with his arm. 
[01:48:30]  Holy shit.  He almost made it out, with his arm stuck in the Pino hatchback.  Dead?  Oh, so dead.  So dead.  So completely, totally dead.  So dead.  You ever have...  You ever have...  Oh, no.  That was after...  Well, it was after, but Hanging Girl?  Wow.  That was after, though.  Did you go to school?  The Overlook Hotel?  No kidding.  Yes.  Did you have a massacred twin to the max? 
[01:49:00]  Great study hole.  I remember going to my high school reunion.  We were asking about people that weren't there, and I was talking to this one girl.  I'm like, oh, so how's Blah Blah?  Oh.  Oh.  She didn't hear.  Oh, you're such a great lady.  Ready for this?  She did it just before the reunion, because she started thinking about where her life is,  because the reunion does that to people.  She fought real hard, Margie.  So literally a week before the 10-year reunion, she went out, hanging herself. 
[01:49:30]  Wow.  Hung herself.  But that's...  We've got to keep with in school.  Had some drug overdoses, too.  Really?  Yeah.  A couple ODs.  I don't think they had any.  Some died.  Some didn't.  I remember kids being taken out in ambulances.  I remember the...  In school?  Yeah.  In a wheelchair.  Some kid just completely fucked up with the cops there and the EMTs just wheeling him  out the front door as everybody just looked on.  That never goes away.  You can't come back to school and be like, all right, business as usual. 
[01:50:00]  You're now the kid that had to be taken out in the wheelchair.  You ever have drill holes in Skull Guy?  No.  To drain, like, whatever the fuck was going on in his brain?  Ew.  Kind of fluid.  More than once?  Like, he went in every once in a while to get his fucking skull drained?  No.  He was actually a friend of mine.  And then, eh.  Yeah, I had one of my friends that turned into a cancer kid.  He didn't make it.  Cancer kid because of steroids.  Really?  He was this guy that was just, like, built like a brick shithouse. 
[01:50:30]  Muscles like crazy, always working out.  And then I went to a party once.  And I hadn't seen the guy in a while.  And I went to a party and looked at this kid that had those cripple crutches.  You know those ones with the little metal brace around your wrists and the handles and  not, like, the underarm crutches?  And he was trying to walk with those.  And I looked at his face.  I'm like, why does he look so familiar but could not even recognize him? 
[01:51:00]  And he goes, Anthony, how you doing?  I went, hey, what's up?  And then he said his name.  And I was like, holy shit.  Like, I just was like, hey, hey, what's up?  Not how you doing.  What's up?  And it turned out, you know, steroids gave him the big casino.  Holy shit.  And he dropped dead.  Holy shit.  Went from being just a huge muscle-bound, like, meathead.  And it was steroids, you think?  Oh, it absolutely was.  To skinny, friggin' frail cancer kid.  But that rarely happens with the steroids. 
[01:51:30]  Well, it happened to him.  Huh.  I don't know what they were doing, but.  I think I'm done with my, I think that's it for me.  Yeah, I think I'm about through.  I'm trying to think.  Yeah.  Yep, yeah, I'm done.  Oh, wow.  Let's say hi to Dave in North Carolina, a little audience participation.  Dana White's here, by the way, so we've got to head toward a break  and start getting the guests rolling in here.  Today we've got Dana White, Duff McKagan from Guns N' Roses fame,  and he's going to play some of his new stuff, and Jesse Ventura, 
[01:52:00]  the big showdown with Anthony, who's about an hour away.  What?  I'm not saying anything.  I'll let him speak his piece.  Everyone's entitled.  Let's go to Dave in North Carolina.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Dave.  One of my friends was buried alive.  Wow.  Buried alive, kid.  Buried alive.  Buried alive.  Little brother and everything.  We're in a little cave.  Common reference.  They were jumping up on top of it, and it caved in on them.  Wow.  And buried alive.  Wow.  You know something? 
[01:52:30]  I kind of remember things like that.  I had broken arm, kid, out of my tree fort.  Yeah.  Everyone had broken arm, kid.  Thank you, sir.  No, it wasn't Richard.  Yes, sir.  It was a broken heart.  Dave in Connecticut.  Dave.  Hello.  Hello, Dave.  You're all in there?  Kentucky.  Hey, this is Dano from Kentucky.  Oh, no.  Dano, what's up, buddy?  Hey, I've called to bring the happy back.  Yep. 
[01:53:00]  We had a guy got caught fucking his dog kid at my school.  Hi, John, if you're listening.  Jesus.  Let's go to Susan in Pennsylvania.  I've heard of some of these, Susan.  Really?  In Pennsylvania.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, Pennsylvania's known for the quarry, right?  Susan.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  There was a kid in my high school who got real stoned and was hanging out at the quarry  and ended up falling over the edge.  Wow.  They get a kid pretty much every other year in Boston in the quarries, right? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, they drown in the water down there.  They fall up and crack their skulls open.  Yeah, I think he hit the side before he even got to the bottom.  Oh, here's one we haven't touched on.  Thank you, Susan.  Heather in Virginia.  Heather.  Morning, boys.  Hey, I've got murdered by another student kid.  Holy shit, really?  It was pretty intense.  It was kind of before that became more common.  He just got shot in the back in the woods one night.  It was awful. 
[01:54:00]  Well, I forgot to tell you, I've told this on the air,  but the story of the two kids that I went to school with.  One kid went over the other kid's house to rob it.  His mother was home.  He raped and killed the mother and then burnt the house down.  Oh, my God.  Did it hurt the friendship?  No, they're actually still best of friends.  They got over it.  You went to school with that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was some crazy suburban white kid rage. 
[01:54:30]  Let's go to Joe in Texas.  Joe.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Joe.  I'm stuck in traffic here, so give me a sec.  I actually went to high school with a kid who was stuck in a wheelchair,  and he had no outer layer of skin.  Like he couldn't fight off bacterial infections or nothing.  You keep believing in your gods.  What the fuck?  I don't know.  What lesson are we supposed to learn from a kid with no outer skin layer?  God has. 
[01:55:00]  God, explain this shit to me.  He works in mysterious ways.  I needed to make a human with no skin to walk the earth.  Where he gets sunburned in the shade.  Oh.  What the fuck is that?  Muscle tissue burn.  Right.  It kind of sort of reminded me of a burn victim.  Slash.  Somebody with a really, really bad sunburn.  He was constantly peeling.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  That's pretty horrible.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Hey.  No, it's funny.  Me and you were trying to be cool going back and forth with our little bit. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  And these guys are killing us.  Yeah, they got some good stuff.  They got way better.  We had kid kill himself because we made fun of him, guy.  Jeremy.  Uh, Chris in Georgia.  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  We had a guy that got shot in the ass over a lover's quarrel.  And when he came back to school, everybody kept kicking him in the ass and giggling.  And he hung himself outside the school the next morning.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Just horrifying everybody. 
[01:56:00]  Keep your suicide to yourself, please.  We've got to live on.  We've got to live on.  We're punching out, thanks.  All right.  We don't need nightmares because you had to kill yourself in front of everybody.  Uh, Bill in Jersey.  We had father who killed mother with kid's baseball bat kid.  That's nice.  We had accidental death.  All right, whatever.  Tom in New Orleans.  We had girl with frozen hot dog and coochie.  All right, come on.  That's a good one.  Steve in Cape Cod.  We had kid who killed self with flare gun.  Wow.  Ow.  Let's say hi to Steve.  Steve.  Hey, what's happening, guys? 
[01:56:30]  How are you, buddy?  All right.  Yeah.  Oceanside High School, Long Island, like 1985.  Man, this Chinese kid, his parents must have really put the pressure on him because they just  wheeled him out with a big burnt head.  Tough as fuck.  Punch it out.  That's pretty bad.  We had no arms, kid.  It was.  I'll never forget it.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Mark in Florida, no arms, kid.  We had run over by a huge truck kid.  This is a weird one.  I don't know if this is true.  We'll see.  Gary in Cleveland.  Gary. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  I had a couple friends that had a cow farm, and they had a big slurry pit, and one brother  must have fallen in, they found the other brother's wallet and shoes laying on a catwalk.  He went in after him.  It's like a, what do you call it?  A quicksand.  They both surrounded him in cow shit.  Oh, wow.  That's a hell of a way to go out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Punch it out, boys.  Coke Logic caught your Jeremy joke, by the way.  It wasn't a joke. 
[01:57:30]  It was just kind of a statement.  Yeah, well, we'll end with Kelsey in Massachusetts.  Kelsey.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Kelsey.  I went to the birthday party of I Shot My Mom Girl.  Really?  Wow.  After or before?  Before.  Ah, see, the after had been cooler.  Yeah, well, I was like six years younger than her, and for some reason, we were in dance  class together, and she invited me to a birthday party, and like three years later, she shot her  mom on the couch, went to life in prison. 
[01:58:00]  Jesus.  Jesus.  Unbelievable.  That's brutal.  All right.  Thank you, Kelsey.  Welcome to Jersey.  Punch it out.  All right.  We could do this for another half hour.  Look at the phones.  But we've got to take a break, because we've got Dana White standing by.  Yeah.  Good friend of the show.  Also, Jesse Ventura, let's not forget, around 9.30, 10 o'clock, somewhere around there.  Absolutery.  And then Duff McKagan coming in and playing a song or two and talking about finances.  Is he?  Big finance guy.  Ron Howard was in recently. 
[01:58:30]  His movie doing very well, Angels and Demons.  Yep.  And the boys noticed that he did a lot of laughing during the interview, so they strung together  all his laughs.  Loft and loft.  Right.  Loft your goddamn head off.  And now the Ron Howard laugh thing is taking on a life of its own.  Yes.  Starting with this one from Derek and Danny.  And now, Academy Award winning director Ron Howard getting high.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
[01:59:00]  Have you guys heard a word I've said? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  Dana.  What the fuck was I even saying?  What was it like, man, when you were on that TV show?  Well, the thing.  Run.  Man, we should hang out more.  That was Academy Award winning director, Ron Howard, getting high. 
[02:00:00]  You know what?  That's really funny, Danny.  Huh?  We're still on the air, bro.  We're on the air.  I thought we were going into break.  Oh, I know.  No, we're still on the air.  Because I just wanted to give Danny props.  That's really funny.  Propellers?  Giving people propellers.  I think we have a few more in us. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  But them getting high, watching Beavis and Butthead is very fun.  Yeah, there's another idea that's been floating around, so I think we'll get that by the end  of the week.  It's good, man.  Dana White next from the UFC.  Opie and Anthony.  Here, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony show.  In studio.  Dana White from the UFC.  Yeah.  What's up, Dana?  What's up, buddy?  How are you?  We realize we never met you face-to-face.  Yeah, I know.  We've done a million phone calls with you.  You've met Jimmy. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  The guys who've been out to the fight, I've met.  I'm looking at the graphics for this UFC Undisputed, which is coming out today, I guess,  on Xbox and for PlayStation 3.  It's almost creepy, the graphics are so good.  It's really good.  Dude, I have never been a fighter game player.  Right.  I've usually been a first-person shooter, whatever.  This, I've got to get this.  Yeah, it's it.  This looks so cool.  I mean, when Mars is playing over here, and he's kicking these guys in their side, and  then you just see, like, it starts as a slight bruise on the guy's side and turns into this 
[02:01:30]  hematoma.  You know, just, the guys take the abuse, they get cut.  Yeah.  The game's amazing.  What's cool about this game, too, is that, you know, you don't have to be a psycho gamer  to play it.  You know, I don't play a lot of video games, and I have fun playing this game.  Yeah, it's, it looks great.  I mean, the graphics.  The Liddell, when Liddell is announced, they announce the fighters, and it's like, it's 
[02:02:00]  got Liddell's, it's like, it's his face.  It's like, it's his, the eyes, and the attitude, and the way he kind of just bobs his head  a little and looks around.  Isn't that creepy?  One of the, I think it was Cro Cop, shook his, like, hand, like, in between rounds, like  a fighter will do before they go back.  It was like, ugh.  Marcelino's playing right now, and he's Rampage, and he is beating the crap out of Chuck Liddell  at the moment.  I'd like to see you do that in real life there, Mars.  But, uh, all right, Chuck's getting some shots in. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, a few shots.  He got a shot in.  So is, uh.  Oh, wow.  Damn it.  He's got that, he's got that Liddell overhand punch.  Now, do you know anything about how this was made?  Because, uh, did each fighter actually put the, uh, motion capture?  Yeah, they all got mapped.  Every guy got mapped and went in there, and, and it's literally like, uh, having a remote  control and controlling Rampage or Chuck Liddell.  It really is.  You know what we noticed?  You actually notice their techniques.  Right.  Or, it's not just like one guy and the other guy, and here's a right hand, and there's 
[02:03:00]  a left.  When they punch, you go, yeah, that's the way Liddell punches.  Right.  Liddell, because Liddell has that muscle stomach.  It's like, it almost looks like he's, it's a weird stomach, but it's all muscle.  Oh, Liddell's down, by the way.  And, uh, he's got it in the game.  This is really, this is probably the best Rampage I've ever seen on a fight game.  Yeah, that's great.  And, and most of the fight games, you know, uh, other than, like, the WWE, they're, they're  all just boxing.  All you can do is punch.  Yeah.  With this thing, you can punch, kick, knee, elbow, grapple, go to the ground, and, uh, 
[02:03:30]  it's, it's really, uh, this game's amazing.  Yeah, we were watching, uh, Mars was fighting, uh, Lesnar against Mirko Krokop, and, uh, it  was just, you know, Krokop was kicking Lesnar, nothing was happening, and then, uh, Lesnar just got to  the ground, uh, and took him down.  It was, it, that's exactly how those two were fighting.  Liddell's cut over his eye now, and that doesn't just go away, like, like, you know, after the  round is finished, uh, and they come back, it doesn't just go away, he comes back, he's  still cut, he's still got the damage. 
[02:04:00]  Jesus.  Wow, nice high kick, and they do, in between rounds, they do, like, slow-mos of some of  the highlights of the round you just did.  Can we work it on him in the corner?  Can we ask the important question?  How, you, you got, uh, the girls, and, uh, they're, they're, they're fucking breasts  move like real breasts.  Yeah, motion capture on tits, I like to see them do that.  Did you motion capture the tits?  They put the ping pong balls on their nipples, they walk across the, track it.  Walk across, yeah, there you go, bouncy, bouncy.  Look at that, look at that, they're bouncing, they're fantastic. 
[02:04:30]  No, they did an amazing job.  You know, we, we had a, we had a, when we bought the company, we married into a deal that  was already done, and the game sucked, it was bad, and, uh, you know, in the video game  world, you come out with a shitty game, you don't get a second chance, so we, we've been  fortunate that the UFC's grown the way it has, so when we got the second opportunity  to do a game, we looked for a partner that would do it right, and, and really make a  great game, and this, this game is literally groundbreaking, it's a really good game.  I'm not just saying that, because it's my game either, because we, we had a game that 
[02:05:00]  sucked, and this game is amazing.  There's blood on the, on the mat, it's, it's fantastic, man.  It's like, Dan, I gotta ask you something, I gotta ask you something, because we're  watching, obviously, Mars, uh, how, he's got Chuck Liddell and Rampage Jackson fighting.  Do you feel like the UFC is going through, uh, a little bit of growing pains right now?  Because a lot of the guys we really, you know, kind of grew up watching in the last few years  are all pretty much out of the game.  Nah, you know, that, that's part of the game.  I mean, it's no different than baseball or football or boxing, um, you know, everybody turns 
[02:05:30]  40, man, and, and, uh.  Who are some of the guys coming up that we really should start paying attention to?  There's a kid coming up on this, uh, you know, as far as heavyweights go.  Our heavyweight division's never looked better than it does right now.  It's funny, you know, you look a year and a half ago and people were talking about, uh,  how weak the heavyweight division is.  Now it's, it's one of the best divisions.  And, uh, there's a kid named Cain Velasquez.  Yeah.  And right now he's 5-0, and he's fighting on this card in Germany.  And, uh, this kid is going to be a, a, a monster.  We think this kid is probably going to be the heavyweight champion in the next few years. 
[02:06:00]  But it depends on how, how much Brock Lesnar continues to, uh, grow as a fighter.  Um, you know, obviously a lot of the talent that we pump out on the, on the ultimate fighter.  You know, in the beginning, these guys didn't get the respect they deserve.  Well, now they are.  And, uh, I think this fight between Evans and Machida, that's happening this Saturday, um,  the guy that wins this fight is without a doubt either the best or one of the best 205-pounders.  Whoever wins this fight fights Rampage Jackson. 
[02:06:30]  So, we got some fun stuff coming up.  This is how you know UFC is going to be here for a long time.  Like, uh, my nephew is 14, and Keith Robinson's son is 15, and it's all they talk about is these guys.  None of them watch boxing.  None of them do.  They all watch UFC.  They all, they all have their favorite UFC guys.  Yeah, there's no excitement in, uh, in the boxing world anymore.  It's not that boxing sucks.  It doesn't.  Um, but it's, it's hard to, it's just hard to get into it when you know that.  You know what the problem is with boxing, too?  First of all, you know, there's not any stars like there were in boxing when we were growing up. 
[02:07:00]  And, uh, you know, the problem is, too, is that it's just, it's just not that exciting.  When's the last time you saw, other than Pacquiao, when's the last time you saw a great boxing match, you know?  Yeah, you know, these guys are making 20 million a fight, and it's just, it's going to be boring.  Yeah.  20 million a fight, and they don't fight.  Oh, that was a hell of a, hell of a punch there.  A short little left.  Do you replace?  Yeah.  Replace on what you just did?  Nice.  Do they incorporate, like, fighters' weaknesses against each other? 
[02:07:30]  Because Liddell has never beaten Rampage.  Do they, do they, I guess they kind of put that into their makeup.  No, yeah, well, you know, you have your, the exact strengths and weaknesses of the actual fighters.  They did such a good job on this thing.  You know what's funny?  Since I've walked in here, you guys have not stopped staring at the television watching the thing.  Well, that's good for you, right?  It's amazing.  It's like it's a real fight.  Trust me, we've had some shitty video games up on that screen.  Oh, God.  This is amazing.  Pay attention to the guests.  I mean, this is a good thing that we're, uh, really into, that really is something.  Because the way, it's like little weird things, like the way the feet move, like when they're 
[02:08:00]  kind of, like, just kind of stepping back, it's like, that's the way a guy moves back.  They don't just kind of float back like a lot of video games do.  It looks like, it looks like you're watching Chuck Liddell fly.  Well, what they do, you know what, you know what, let me see the controller for a second.  They actually just showed me this yesterday.  Actually, I just learned yesterday.  Let me back up before I get it knocked out here.  Yeah, really?  You're rampaging.  Oh, rampage with a spinning back fist.  Oh, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.  Chuck's supposed to have a great takedown defense in this thing.  Let me see if I can pass this guard here.  All right, you got Chuck down. 
[02:08:30]  So you're Chuck, right?  Yeah, there we go.  I got the half guard.  Now I'm going to try to get the side control here.  Too bad kneeing in the balls isn't illegal.  Chuck Liddell would be in big trouble right now.  Yeah, really?  Chuck's on his back.  Rampage is kind of kneeling, straddling him.  Chuck's like doing the old punches to the side of his head.  I'm going to stand this up.  I'm going to start.  And the ref just kind of ran over.  Yeah, he stood us up.  Hey, get up.  Back to...  Can you mix weight classes?  Chuck's supposed to have real great takedown defense, but Rampage... 
[02:09:00]  Rampage can take him down, apparently, every time here.  Apparently so.  What did I do?  Well, you have to...  All right.  You get back to Mars.  Here, you're doing so.  Can you mix weight...  I'm paused.  Can you mix weight classes?  That's a good question.  I would love to do that.  That I don't know.  I don't know the answer to that.  I don't know the answer to that.  Just come and beat up some little guy.  Well, I would just take Lesnar and then bully some, like, lightweight.  Some guy's 108 pounds, just throw him through the roof.  Just be fun to do that.  Are you guys coming to 100? 
[02:09:30]  When is 100?  It's July 11th.  I think I want to go to that.  This Saturday, I'm actually...  I'm away doing a gig.  Which one is 100?  Who's fighting at 100?  It's Lesnar and Mir.  Yeah.  We'll be there.  It's GSP and Tiago Alves.  And the coaches from the season of The Ultimate Fighter, Bisping and Henderson.  July 11th.  Yes, I absolutely want to go there.  I'm running it down, too.  Just send the private jet.  We'll be there, man.  Yeah.  Perfect.  Where's that?  Where is it at?  In Vegas.  It's in Mandalay Bay.  Does UFC have a private jet? 
[02:10:00]  Nice.  We do.  All right.  So you're going to pick us up, right?  Wear Teterboro.  We'll never see it.  Just be at Teterboro with our bags packed, ready to go.  Absolutely.  Got a little UFC hats all ready for the ride.  Could you make a stop at Republic?  Because I really got to pick me up there.  It's closer.  More convenient for me.  Yeah, we'll look like just complete idiots with our UFC gear on, getting ready for our big  flight to Vegas.  I want to go to that, man.  I would love to go to that.  That fight was delayed.  When were they supposed to fight, Mir and...  They're supposed to fight on this one this weekend.  Oh, this way?  Okay.  This Saturday is Machida and Evans and Matt Serra and Matt Hughes. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, we had Matt Serra was in last week.  He's great, isn't he?  Yeah, he seems very ready.  He's definitely not shy about shit talking.  I like that.  Well, you know what?  This is one of those fights.  It's very rare in the UFC that we have guys who really hate each other.  You know, everybody respects each other and these guys hate each other.  Hate each other.  That makes the fight a little better.  Yeah.  It does make it fun.  Let's be honest with you.  No, I agree.  I hate when they really get along.  I absolutely agree.  Yeah.  Hey, Blue Heeler from Kentucky, right?  UFC 2009. 
[02:11:00]  Best-selling game right now on GameStop.com.  Excellent.  Doing well so far.  Yeah.  Last night, we went down to...  We were actually in Times Square at the GameStop down there.  And at midnight, they opened it up and started selling games to people.  About 200 people showed up last night down at the GameStop.  How many people didn't go to work or school or anything?  It's like, if you're at midnight, you're not getting home and going,  I can't wait to play this tomorrow.  Right.  No, that's what they were saying.  You load it up, and then at 5 in the morning, you're like,  oh, Christ, I spent the whole night playing.  That's what every one of them says.  We're not sleeping tonight.  We're going to play the game. 
[02:11:30]  Danny showed me that they got a new Silent Hill game out, though.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  I love that Silent Hill.  Well, get both.  We've got someone from Knockout.com wants to ask you a question.  Rich in New Hampshire.  Rich.  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  We've got Dana White in studio.  Dana, long-time fan.  I was actually at UFC 1.  I write for a small, independent MMA website called Knockout.com.  I just had an article up a couple days ago about Rashad Evans and Leota Machida, 
[02:12:00]  the matchup coming up.  Who do you like?  I've been following Machida since the Stephen Bonner fight.  I've been in the martial arts my whole life.  I'm a karate guy.  So, you know, I'm a big-time Machida fan, and I sprung for, you know, the cage side seats  because I've been waiting for this fight for a long time.  Oh, cool.  So you're coming out this weekend?  Yeah, I'm going to be at the weigh-ins and do the whole thing,  and I'm going to write a couple articles for a number of online sources. 
[02:12:30]  Cool.  I wanted to ask you a question.  With the passing of the unified rules, do you ever see there being a set of systematized unified judging criteria  that are more thorough than, say, you know, the NSAC, you know, judging criteria that they have right now?  Yeah, I mean, I'm the one who's always bitching about judging and reffing, and I think it can always get better.  You know, it's going to take time. 
[02:13:00]  When you think about it, you know, the unified rules that we've been fighting under in the sport,  the way that it is now is about, what, nine years old?  Yeah.  So it's going to take time, and we're focused on working with the commissions to make sure that we have the best judges and refs possible.  But, I mean, even if you look at something like football, basketball that's been around for so long,  there's still tons of mistakes made in football and basketball, and, you know, we're going to have those problems.  Sure.  Do you see a more comprehensive system coming down the pipeline for training judges in the future? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  You know, that's not up to us.  It's up to the athletic commissions.  The different state athletic commissions handle that.  But we do everything.  You know, obviously, we've got Mark Ratner on board, one of the most respected guys ever in any athletic commission, in any combat sport.  And he's very proactive on getting out there and working with these commissions and educating, you know, the judges and refs.  Sure. 
[02:14:00]  Who do you like in the Evans-Machita fight?  It's a tough fight, man.  You know, Rashad has been so explosive.  And, you know, this is a guy who, in the ultimate fighter, was a straight wrestler.  Now he's got knockout highlight reels of, you know, that kick to the head of Sean Salmon, knocking Chuck Liddell out the way that he did.  The guy's a beast.  I don't know.  I think, like I said earlier, I think the guy that comes out of this fight with a win is possibly the best 205-pounder in the world.  But we'll just have to see if Rampage can beat either one of them. 
[02:14:30]  I absolutely agree.  One last question, then I'll leave you alone.  If somebody were to be interested in, you know, applying for a job with, you know, Zufa, where would you go about initiating that?  A lot of people are interested.  That's the most asked question I ever get.  Info at UFC.com.  Info at UFC.com, yeah.  And you can send a resume or whatever it is there.  Okay, great.  Thank you.  All right.  No kidding. 
[02:15:00]  All right.  Thanks.  I appreciate it.  You got it.  Thank you.  Info at UFC.com.  We're just doing our interview for us.  Why not?  That's great.  Why not?  That's the question I was going to ask anyway.  I'm not going to claim to be an expert on the UFC.  I like checking it out and whatnot.  Oh, yeah.  I got a question for Dana White.  You're in New York City.  When the fuck is this thing coming to New York?  Next year.  We're working on it.  We're getting close finally?  Yeah, we've been working on that hard.  You know, the two states we had left were Massachusetts and New York.  Amazing.  We could do a fight en masse this summer, but we don't want to do it in Boston this summer. 
[02:15:30]  We're going to wait until, you know, the way that Boston works, there's 100,000 less  people there in the summer in our demo, you know, because all the schools are out.  And then we're going to do New York next year.  Well, it's obvious why New York is a holdout.  It's the boxing capital of the United States anyway.  But what about Boston?  It's not that they've been a holdout.  We really haven't focused.  You know, we had laid out all the states that we were going to hit over the last few years.  And realistically, New York and Massachusetts were the last two. 
[02:16:00]  And then we're moving up into Toronto after this.  You know, we've got to get it sanctioned in Toronto.  We just got it done in Germany.  We're doing a fight in Germany in June.  We're working on France.  We're bigger than U.S. steel.  We're constantly working on opening up all these new territories.  Who was the resistance in New York, though?  Because was it the Garden?  And there had to be some kind of a perspective.  No, no.  The Garden was great.  Actually, the Garden's been great working with us.  It's not that there's ever been any pushback. 
[02:16:30]  What you guys got to understand is when you move into these states, you're actually changing laws.  You know, and that doesn't get done overnight.  That is true.  You know what I mean?  It takes time.  It takes time and a lot of effort and work.  And, yeah, it's not easy.  That first time when you're in the Garden, though, you're going to be out of your mind.  Yeah.  You're going to be like, holy shit.  That's going to be cool.  You want to see it at the Garden.  I'm excited for both gardens.  The Boston Garden.  Sure.  That'll be huge.  It'll be fun.  Even though it's named after some bank or something now up there.  How do you change the name of the Boston Garden?  Yeah, it's true.  And it keeps changing every couple years. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, when the banks fold or merge or something.  Yeah.  No, you're right.  Is it true Mark Cuban is keeping you out of Dallas?  That's coming in.  No.  Okay.  Are you in Dallas?  It actually couldn't be any further from the truth.  Mark Cuban has been trying to get us down there.  Let's go to Jason in Maryland.  Jason, talking to Dana White.  We're checking out his new UFC video game.  It looks amazing.  Go ahead, Jason.  No, we lost Jason.  Let's say hi to Rich in Georgia.  Rich.  Hi, Dana. 
[02:17:30]  I was wondering, is that the league kid from the minor league group?  Is he the real deal or is he still minor league?  Was it Kung Lee?  Kung Lee?  Yeah, actually I like Kung Lee.  Kung Lee recently beat the shit out of Frank Shamrock, somebody that I'm not too fond of.  And I like Kung.  He's a good kid.  He's a tough fighter.  He's been around for a long time.  And I've been trying to get him in and possibly a fight with Anderson Silva. 
[02:18:00]  But, you know, the kid, literally, you know, you always hear these guys, you know, saying,  yeah, I'm thinking about getting into the movies and, you know, none of them ever do any movies that make any money or do anything.  But Kung Lee is actually making money doing movies.  Yeah, he's a great, he's a popular guy.  But I didn't know, the reason I missed him, does he have the ground game for y'all?  Yeah, you know, his ground game isn't the best out there.  But, you know, like I said, he beat Frank Shamrock.  That means something.  He was the first one to beat him in a while. 
[02:18:30]  And, you know, you can never answer these questions.  The only way to answer the questions is have these guys fight.  Could Kung Lee beat Anderson Silva?  Who knows?  I'd love to bring him in and find out.  But he's a good kid.  I respect him.  And, yeah, I think he's a great fighter.  All right, I appreciate it, y'all.  Great, great, great UFC, man.  We love it.  Thank you.  I appreciate the support.  And you said that you and Ashley Cro-Cop is returning in June, which I'm kind of happy about that.  I'd like to see him fight live. 
[02:19:00]  He actually, Cro-Cop, you know, he and I have always kept in contact.  And he claims he wasn't in the right place the last time he fought mentally.  And he took all this time off.  He's 100% healed and says he's ready to come in here and win the heavyweight title.  So I'm real interested to have him back.  Isn't he on the parliament or something?  And he's got, like, a real political position.  Really?  Yeah, in Croatia, I think.  Yeah, he does.  Really?  Yeah.  He's huge in Croatia.  I mean, when he was fighting, you know, he came from Pride in Japan. 
[02:19:30]  Right.  And when he would have his fights, they'd beam him over to Croatia.  It was like everybody who had a television in Croatia was watching when this guy would fight.  It's amazing how he looked.  All three people in Croatia are telling him to have a TV.  Hey, Danny, you do any fighting yourself?  No.  Because you started by training some of these guys, right?  No.  Actually, I started out managing.  I used to manage Chuck Liddell and Tito.  But I come from boxing.  You know, I boxed when I was younger.  Did you box your ass off or what? 
[02:20:00]  No, not anymore.  Back then, maybe.  You did all right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm a promoter now, so I wasn't...  No, I understand.  Well, you should talk a lot.  So I'm wondering, you know, if you ever get in a situation where you might have to use  some kind of skills to get yourself out of a jam.  Obviously, this is a crazy job.  I meant shit talk in a very positive way.  I know what you mean.  A positive way.  I know.  Okay.  You better.  I appreciate guys like him.  I, you know, and I wouldn't call it shit talking as much as just telling the truth.  When you tell the truth, you know, people, they get shit talking, you know, and I don't 
[02:20:30]  know if you guys saw the shit show they just did on me on E60 on ESPN.  Oh, really?  These guys, yeah, totally took some shots at me and, you know, it's almost like they don't  want anybody that's honest and tells the truth.  You know, I could go out there and be phony.  I could have the lawyers write everything that I say and, you know, I could go out and give  these written speeches and, you know, that's just not what I want to do.  What did they say about you?  I didn't, E60, what we don't know.  We don't know, to be honest with you.  Yeah, E60 did this story on me. 
[02:21:00]  They followed me around for months and basically gave one side, you know, they brought up Tito  Ortiz.  I mean, how much longer are we going to talk about Tito Ortiz?  Tito Ortiz has been with the UFC in a couple years.  This guy named Pat Miletic, I don't know if you guys know who Pat Miletic is, and they  actually came out here to New York to talk to the assemblymen that doesn't like it out  here in New York.  And basically, you know, they interviewed me about Tito and this guy. 
[02:21:30]  I gave them, you know, hours and hours of responses and they didn't use any of it.  You know, they gave their side of the story and didn't give the other responses.  Yeah, we know that.  It's just such bullshit reporting.  I talk about our Bill O'Reilly appearance over and over again.  You got to learn.  You got to just go live.  You know what I mean?  You just get, you got to go live.  You get so sick of it.  I agree.  You get so sick of doing it.  It's just whatever.  Because they tape, they tape you for over an hour and the piece is only going to run  for 10, 15 minutes.  In our case, it was like maybe a 10 minute piece.  And it was like, holy fuck.  They left out a lot of stuff. 
[02:22:00]  Exactly.  Exactly.  So, you know, man, it's just like, that's what I, that's what I love about the internet right  now.  With the internet, you know, we do these, we do these video blogs.  Because I'll talk directly to the, to the fans instead of having a middleman go in there  and decide what they're going to, what they're going to put in there and not put in there.  Oh, shit.  Well, it's made a lot of that reporting irrelevant because again, you can, at least you can go  out and respond now and go online immediately and have the same amount of people watching.  No, exactly.  Or more.  This is what I meant.  More people.  And you didn't, you didn't leave this in the interview and you didn't do this. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  It's perfect.  Yeah.  You had a way to fight back.  You had a thing where you went after, you know, a reporter.  You had a little bit of a thing recently, um, you know, you had to kind of the gay and  lesbians went after you and wanted you to apologize.  And, uh, you did pull the video, um, but you didn't apologize to Loretta.  What exactly was your issue with?  There you go.  That, I mean, that's exactly what I'm talking about.  This, this website out there, basically this, this girl wrote a story.  Not one fucking word of it was true.  It was, it was all bullshit. 
[02:23:00]  The entire story was full of shit.  Isn't that amazing?  Yeah.  Exactly.  And they can't.  And that's what happened.  I flipped out and did a video blog and, uh, you know, what words did you use?  A lot of them.  I used a lot of them.  Carpet muncher?  No, no, no.  Did you get creative?  No, no, no.  Mike?  No.  What happened was, uh, the reality is it's not 1987 anymore.  You know, you can't, you know, go out and, you know, write these things that aren't true.  And now we have a voice.  We can actually come back and respond.  Yeah, you can actually respond.  Exactly.  Yep.  So that's what I did. 
[02:23:30]  And, uh, you know, it was, it was a little aggressive and, uh, good for you.  And people, uh, you know, I ended up offending the gay and lesbian community because I used  the F word and, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  And listen, the, the, the, the, it's now the F word.  Yes.  No, you know what though?  Let me tell you, I went through some shit with this thing.  It's, it's, it's, I'm 39 years old and as being a guy, it's a word I've used since I  was a kid.  You know what I mean?  That's how we say it all the time.  And when I said this word, it was in no way, shape or form, you know, geared toward anybody's 
[02:24:00]  sexual orientation.  So when, when GLAAD came out and put up on their website, basically, you know, they wanted  me to apologize.  The thing that sucked about this thing, all these, uh, people that don't even cover us, you  know, the CNNs and I mean, you name it, name every major media outlet all ran with Dana  White, UFC president, uh, gay bashing, Dana White, anti, anti-gay slurs and all this stuff 
[02:24:30]  didn't, didn't put it in context, didn't tell the story.  Right, right.  Makes it look like, you know, I'm this homophobe and I'm out there gay bashing, which was the  furthest thing from the truth.  You know what I mean?  You're using the word in the context that guys use it when we're annoyed at each other.  Yeah.  Cause I call someone a douchebag or a, you, we call someone a douchebag, you don't really  think that they're a vinegar filled bag with a nozzle.  We understand the common usage in our language and they, they harp on the word.  Exactly.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Like that's what people like to do these days.  It's annoying.  Yeah.  You say if your friend isn't going out one night, you come over the house, you go to 
[02:25:00]  pick them up to go out to the bar or something like that.  And it's like, oh, you're not going out.  And then you'll call them that or even, even just say, come on, don't be gay.  Yeah.  Come on out.  And then, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't mean that.  Exactly.  It's completely different meaning at that point, but you can't.  And I think it's just, so did you apologize to them and say, look, this wasn't directed  at you guys.  Exactly.  All right.  Fair enough.  So then there was a laundry list of people who wanted apologies for me and I wasn't apologizing.  Listen, I said that word. 
[02:25:30]  It offended the gay and lesbian community and I didn't mean it in that sense.  I said, I'm sorry.  It didn't, you know, there's that word.  But all the rest of you, kiss my ass.  I'm not apologizing to any of you.  Now the shitheads are mad?  Jesus Christ.  Exactly.  Apologize to them.  And I'm definitely not apologizing to her.  You know, she goes out and writes a story that's full of lies.  What's her issue with you?  What's her problem?  Why didn't she want to?  I'll tell you exactly what the deal is.  The deal is, that website that she works for, I've had a beef with since the day we started 
[02:26:00]  this company.  Okay.  So these guys don't ever write any positive UFC stories or anything like that.  You know, listen, I was just telling you how great the internet is.  You know, you can go on there and rebuttal stuff like that.  But everybody thinks they're a fucking journalist now.  Okay?  Just because I have a website, it means you're credible and I'm, you know, we should believe  everything you write.  Yeah.  Everybody has a website and everybody's a journalist now.  Well, you know, at least it has its pros and cons.  Back in the day, if you wrote for the LA Times, you actually had to be somebody. 
[02:26:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  You had to be a journalist.  Now fucking anybody can just go out and, hey, I write for...  And they quote them.  Yeah.  And news are like, you could go to Drudge Report.  Exactly.  And it's quoted as news.  Exactly.  And meanwhile, some guy or girl in their basement or something typing away, and then it's  up, before you know it, the news is grabbing it as an actual piece of journalism.  Exactly.  That's just someone's half-assed, unresearched opinion.  Exactly.  Amazing.  And now this chick's running around playing the martyr. 
[02:27:00]  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  You smashed me.  But you're a guy that's brutally honest.  Like, you really...  You say, like, the president of major organizations never talk like you.  So when you apologize, at least it's sincere, because you're not known for running around  saying you're sorry for everything.  That's what I said.  I said, you know, believe me.  If I had a problem with the gay and lesbian community, I'd let you know about it.  And I'd take you on head on.  I wouldn't, you know...  I'm not going to go out and apologize for something that if I didn't...  You know, if that isn't really how I felt.  We've got to get Dana out of here. 
[02:27:30]  He's supposed to leave like five minutes here.  Why?  He's got a busy schedule with this UFC video game.  Yeah.  Honestly, the game is amazing.  I was watching...  I'm looking at Gonzaga and Lesnar.  Well, Lesnar's beating the shit out of him right now.  But there's blood dripping out of his mouth.  This is just...  That is amazing.  The graphics are amazing.  Yeah, we're all...  Thanks.  We're all...  Could you put my disc in there when you're done?  And I would love if you could sign this.  Sure, I'd love to.  I'm taking it.  Uh-huh.  Here's the deal.  Dana White, I got some more for you guys, too. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  Dude.  I'll take one.  Yeah.  I want to see that on the movie theater screen.  Holy shit.  Here's the deal.  UFC 2009 Undisputed in stores today for PS3 and Xbox 360.  And then, of course, UFC 98 featuring Evans and Mashida live on pay-per-view Saturday at 9.  And also our friend Matt Serra, who is...  Serra and Hughes.  Serra and Hughes.  And July 11th is the Frightmare Brock Lesnar fight, which I imagine that's sold out already, but...  Yeah, it sold out in an hour and a half. 
[02:28:30]  We didn't even go on public sale.  Fight Club members bought out all the tickets.  Jesus Christ.  It's going to be fun.  You guys, seriously, if you ever pick a fight, you should come to this one.  It's going to be fun.  Private Jet?  I mean, you are for the private jet.  Really put it over the top.  Bobby's already invited himself.  Watch him send the private jet.  He'll go, you know, because it says Jet Blue on the back of us.  That's the big one.  Go through the terminal.  Hey.  More info.  UFCUndisputed.com.  Dana White, we finally get to meet him.  Jimmy met him, you know, but we get to meet you finally in person. 
[02:29:00]  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for coming in.  Always a pleasure.  Great game, too, by the way.  Staying away to everyone.  Duff McKagan next.  Quick break.  We'll be back.  Opie and Anthony.  What is wrong with you?  What is wrong with you?  He's kidding.  Opie and Anthony.  Is he kidding?  Yes.  I don't know with these rock guys.  That's sarcastic.  Duff McKagan in his studio. 
[02:29:30]  He asked for a tissue, and then someone gave him really hard.  Paper towels.  Paper towels.  He goes, no, I like this better.  I like the rough feeling on my nose.  That's why when you had a cold in school, and you went into the bathroom and blow your  nose with those fucking brown paper towels that had zero absorbency.  You come out.  Yeah, you come out with just your nose ripped to shreds.  Everyone walked around with that red fucking, it's in the 70s or 80s, I have a cold nose.  Duff McKagan in his studio.  Where are you going with this?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Just waiting.  He walked in, saw the UFC video game that's still up on our TV. 
[02:30:00]  You look like you're into this.  I thought it was the game.  Pretty cool, right?  Yeah.  A lot of people that are walking in think it's real.  A couple of your bandmates thought it was like, what?  Just video of...  I thought it was a fight.  You thought it was an actual fight?  Yeah, that's the video game.  Oh, look.  How cool is that?  And it's sick.  The graphics are amazing.  You've got to see the girls when they walk across the ring.  Their boobs bounce nice.  Hey, you guys were on the radio, so I got some news.  People can't see what we're talking about.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:30:30]  That guy.  So we've got to describe it to the listener, man.  So the chicks walking across, you've got to see people out there.  Yeah, but that makes people go and buy the game or YouTube it.  Where are the chicks?  They've come up with breast physics that are amazing.  Yeah, they're all about the breast physics.  Yeah, breast physics now.  They must have put those tracking balls on boobs and actually tracked how they move, how  they naturally swing.  They had to figure out the heaviness of...  Oh.  Yes, the weightiness.  The weightiness of a youthful boob. 
[02:31:00]  Yes.  Hey, we're learning that Duff McKagan is a kickboxer.  Yeah.  I didn't know that, Duff.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Very cool.  I started in 94.  I met my sensei, Benny the Jet, Benny Arquides, who was a legendary guy who actually brought  the sport to the States.  It used to be called Full Contact Karate.  He went to Asia, Thailand, and Japan, and fought their champions and beat them. 
[02:31:30]  You can Google Benny the Jet and you'll see.  He fought the longest action fight against Jackie Chan.  It's a movie called Meals on Wheels.  That was my sensei fighting it.  Meals on Wheels.  Jackie Chan had some wacky titles, didn't he?  No, I don't doubt it, but some of the titles of his movies were like...  Yeah.  I liked, what was that one, Brawl in the Bronx?  Rumble in the Bronx.  Rumble in the Bronx, where it's so not the Bronx, but they're kicking ass in it.  Yeah, yeah.  What do you think, give it away, the mountains in the background? 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, yeah, like the Japanese, Mount Fuji is in the background in the Bronx.  So have you been knocked out kickboxing?  I have been.  With a punch or a kick?  I've been knocked out with a punch and a kick.  Which is more unpleasant, or is it just equally horrifying?  You know, the most horrifying thing to me ever was, I got knocked out with a kick to the liver.  Was that in the ring or at a show where Axl didn't show up on time? 
[02:32:30]  No, I did get knocked out by a bottle back in 92.  But the dangerous thing about fighting in the ring and taking a lot of contact to the head  is that you get used to it really quick.  You do?  Yeah, you know, when you got in that fight in school and you got punched in the nose,  you can't see anything.  No, and the ringing and everything, yeah.  That only happens a couple times, you know, when you're fighting in the ring.  And all of a sudden, you don't notice it. 
[02:33:00]  And it's just kind of like getting punched in the arm.  Dude, that's fucked up.  I couldn't imagine.  And that's why you get boxers and whatnot, you know, kind of punch drunk.  Because they don't feel it anymore.  It's just another, you know, it's just kind of like this.  It's like getting hit anywhere else.  Yeah, and it doesn't hurt because your body gets used to impact.  Who knocked you out with a kick to the liver?  My sensei actually did.  Wow.  Damn.  Take that.  How does that happen?  Is that even possible?  That's getting kicked so hard, your brain just goes, fuck it.  Yeah.  Then your body shuts down. 
[02:33:30]  Wow.  Your body will shut down.  Holy shit.  I didn't know that was possible.  But I'm not trying to say all, I just, I love martial arts.  I'm not saying this and going, yeah, I'm a badass.  It's something that changed my life.  It's kept me sober.  And it's a way of life for me.  The Yukita Khan kickboxing is the, is the.  Who knew that would do more damage to your liver, though, than drinking?  Yeah.  Getting kicked out.  Ow.  Yeah.  So you have black belt.  Uh, it's, we have, yeah, degrees of, uh, uh, levels. 
[02:34:00]  What's the, what's the highest level?  Jedi.  My level.  No.  Let's just, which is.  Don't fuck with me.  Oh, no, I wouldn't.  No, I'm just joking.  I'm not the highest level.  Uh, I know, I'm so gullible.  Really?  Oh, there's the thing you're talking about.  Ah, look at that, Mars.  You missed the boobies.  Ah, Mars, what the fuck?  Why don't you give us a heads up next time?  Mars doesn't like the girls?  What's the matter?  No, he wants to see Brock's chest.  He wants to get back to the city, man.  Yeah, what's up?  What's going on, Mars? 
[02:34:30]  Come on.  Come on.  Ah, gentlemen.  Let me punch up a arm.  So, yeah, you, we, okay, so in the studio we have, um, you know, let's, let's, we have  Jeff Rouse.  Hey, guys.  What's up, Jeff?  For Loaded.  And, and Mike Squires.  Fellas?  How you doing, man?  He's come up with a few different names for himself, other than Mike Squires, recently.  What are they?  My favorite.  No one else likes it.  Because it's not good.  It's, it's incredible. 
[02:35:00]  Okay.  Duncan Donust.  I like it.  It's not, it's not Donuts.  It's Donuts.  Donuts.  That's cool, because people would think that that's real, and that your parents were, like,  really fucked up to do that to a kid.  They were.  They were.  Donuts.  You don't need Donuts.  For real.  That's his name.  And people go, what?  Dunkin' Donuts?  No, no.  But wait, that sounds like Dunkin' Donuts.  Oh, literal jam.  Liberal jam.  They'd probably be a loss to it.  You know they'd sue you for that.  Okay, what else?  It's my, it's, that's my birth name. 
[02:35:30]  My favorite was Dinah Ria.  Dinah Ria.  Dinah Ria.  Like Rufus On Fire.  The last name, On Fire.  On Fire.  You gotta put the, yeah, you gotta put the accent somewhere.  It's On Fire.  Yeah, Rufus On Fire.  On Fire.  Yeah.  Duff's new band is loaded.  Interesting name.  Just so people know that, yeah.  Any other names?  It's the name, not the condition.  Right.  That they're in.  Gotcha.  Right.  And they're playing tonight.  Gramercy Theater, East 23rd Street?  We are.  Yeah, we're playing Gramercy tonight.  We're playing, um.  We're on tour. 
[02:36:00]  How cool is that?  So we're playing every night.  You like that?  Yeah, I do.  I, I, I love, um, this band, we haven't been a band for 10 years, and, and so one thing  we do have is we kick ass live.  We, we, we, we, we're doing this a while.  Yeah, we do the live show, not just fucking standing there, doing, doing the job, and I  can't stand going to see a band that just, you could tell they just don't want to be  there.  It's an experience for us, and I, I grew up in a time when, when, you know, uh, I, that  first wave of punk rock hit, and I had seven older brothers and sisters, and I was listening 
[02:36:30]  to their music, which was great.  It was the Beatles and Led Zeppelin and Sly and the Family Stone, but it was theirs, and  all of a sudden, punk rock hit, and I, I saw The Clash in 79, and, and Iggy, Iggy, and,  uh, some of those early gigs I went to go see, uh, really informed me about what the  rock and roll experience should be, and it's participatory, said it 10 times fast.  Participatory.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Is that, I thought that was his name. 
[02:37:00]  Participatory.  And what was it?  I couldn't, last night we were, you know, we get a little punch drunk out here on the  road, because it's eight guys on a bus, and I, but we came to, uh, Little Italy,  and I, I couldn't even say it once fast.  Can you say that 10 times?  I know, there's a lot of little, little, little, like, little things going on there.  Little, little, little.  Yeah, I'm really digressing.  It's all right.  It's what the show is.  Big digression from something else. 
[02:37:30]  From the beginning to the end.  How are you guys doing?  What's going on?  Hey, I gotta, I gotta tell you, the Sunday paper here in New York did an article on you.  I don't know if you saw that.  I didn't see it.  Uh, and they're talking about the whole, you know, financial thing that you're doing.  Which we talked about last time.  He knows his day trading.  Well, you don't day trade.  No.  You're, you're pretty much, uh, more of a, you know.  He's a long guy.  I'm a position guy.  Yeah.  But what I liked about the interview was you're pretty much calling out, uh, what's  his name?  John Stewart did as well.  What the hell?  The guy.  Jim Cramer? 
[02:38:00]  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  Calling out Jim Cramer for really hyping this stuff and making a lot of people panic that,  that don't need to panic.  Uh.  Making it worse than it is.  Um, Nelson Rockefeller, I guess, in, in 1929.  I'm reading a great book right now, by the way.  It's called The Forgotten Man by Amity Schlaes.  And it is 1929 to 1938, um, in this country.  And there was actually about three depressions, economic depressions, in that 10 years, not  just the one. 
[02:38:30]  But there's, it's almost like reading a book from right now.  Really?  Exactly the same conditions, the same mindsets of people, the whole thing.  And, um, Nelson Rockefeller, he was getting his shoes shined in 1929.  We know what happened in 1929.  It was a big.  A big, uh, crash, yeah.  Um, a shoe shined guy was giving him stock tips.  He went back to his office, sold everything.  Oh, shit.  When a guy shining my shoes is a stock picker, it's time to get out. 
[02:39:00]  Everything is overinflated.  You know what happened?  We went through that.  We went through that during the big, uh, internet bubble there, uh, the late 90s.  Um, uh, and I was saying.  I live in Seattle.  So I was right there when that whole dot com thing was going.  It was huge, and everyone's trading, and I said, I go, you know what's fucked up?  I go, like, my landscaper is in the market and telling me shit, and I'm, I didn't know  if that was good or bad or what. 
[02:39:30]  Obviously, if I would have known, uh, Rockefeller's position, that is a bad thing.  But, uh, I was amazed that everyone was in this market, and, uh, it was just ripe to  pop.  Yeah.  And it certainly did.  But, you know, what I'm driving home right now, um, coming on these radio shows, and  I, and I have to do it, um, my, our band Loaded, we have a record that came out about six weeks  ago on Century Media.  The record's called Sick.  We're on an indie label.  We don't have the money to, to market the record. 
[02:40:00]  So a lot of people don't even know the record's out.  We're going out.  You, you guys are cool enough to have, have us on, on your station and have us on your show.  Um, but, we have a record called Sick.  It's out.  We're out touring right now.  We're doing, uh, this is our first time we've ever tried to break the states with this band.  We have a lot of exposure, a lot more exposure in the UK and Europe, and certainly in Japan,  where we've played, um, four or five times.  Um, but we're out playing this big, um, continent of North America and going from city to city 
[02:40:30]  to city playing.  And, uh, I would be remiss if I'm not, I've, I've gone on shows and, and gone through the  whole show and talked about stock picking and blah, blah, blah.  And then you forget the plug.  Yeah, we don't even have to focus too much on it.  That's all.  But the article is out Sunday.  So we just want to acknowledge that.  What's the, what's the, what's, what's going on with Japan?  Why does.  Oh yeah.  You guys, you know what?  I, so I Twittered, by the way, my daughter signed me up for this thing. 
[02:41:00]  So I Twittered this morning, I'm going to use it as like giveaway tickets and stuff,  I guess.  Yeah, sure.  Wow.  Yeah.  So I, I Twittered that I was on, let's see what happens, that I was coming on your show.  And now I'm just trying to figure this whole thing.  You're, you're OP radio on Twitter, right?  No.  That's huge.  What?  Oh, P.  Yeah, no, I'm, I'm Duff64 at, at Twitter.  Yeah.  And it's not Twitter. 
[02:41:30]  We're all, we're all into the, the Twitter thing here.  Duff64 is you.  Yeah, so.  That's it.  Now you're going to get a lot of people on there, bro.  I guess if you say, like, what do we do?  How do we do this?  Say, if you're listening to us right now.  Yes.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Mm-hmm.  And you Twitter me.  Duff64.  I have two tickets for the Gramercy show tomorrow.  The first to Twitter me right now.  Oh, is this how this thing works?  Hold on.  You might have given the wrong day out.  When's the show, guys? 
[02:42:00]  Today.  It's today.  Oh, you said tomorrow.  Did I?  Today.  I meant today.  You don't know.  You've been, you know.  What's today?  Tuesday?  Tuesday night at the Gramercy.  The show is tonight.  So the first two people to Twitter, Duff.  I'm actually going to do it from here.  No, you're not eligible, dummy.  You're not eligible.  Yeah, that's some side rules.  Anything of Twittering back and forth.  No one within arm's length.  Is this the post you're talking about?  No.  No, no, no.  There was an article.  It was a Sunday paper.  Yeah, Sunday.  It was Sunday.  It was a quick little, it was a nice little interview. 
[02:42:30]  It's a funny thing.  It was good.  It was good.  You were saying how, like, the whole housing thing has collapsed around you in Seattle.  You saw everybody lose their fucking life savings, basically.  I did?  You should have.  In Seattle?  Maybe not in those words.  Maybe I should get an exact quote.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know if I was.  Where people really didn't do well in the housing market.  Maybe I was talking about my trip through Detroit.  Oh.  Was I talking about Seattle?  The housing market in Detroit. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  All right.  You know what, if I was talking about Seattle, then I was absolutely talking on my ass.  And they hadn't enough coffee.  I don't know.  All right, we have it in the office.  We could take a look at that.  Duff, you want to play a song?  Yeah.  I see we got the big mixing board.  We got a bunch of guitars in the studio.  The band's loaded.  You can go to myspace.com slash loaded for info.  Got a new album out called Sick.  We do.  Thank you.  Yeah.  There it is.  And that's.  Where can they get that?  They can get it at your Best Buy. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  At your FYE.  Cool.  Probably from our website, duff-loaded.com or our MySpace site.  But yeah, it's out in stores.  Cool.  You know.  Yeah, Best Buy is where you're.  Now you're really putting me on the spot.  No, no.  At the record store.  The record store.  The thing is, like, Best Buy is a great place to go to get a desk, man.  And a TV.  Yeah.  And a DVD player and whatever else.  I'm just, like, you walk in there and go, okay, I can get everything I need here.  I need a cable. 
[02:44:00]  It's hard to steal stuff.  XLR cable.  You've tried that recently?  You can.  Yes.  It's impossible.  It's impossible to steal anything.  You've got to run through a big guy that looks at your receipt when you go through the door.  What's up with that?  They don't trust me?  They don't trust you.  He's got to take it and make a little check mark on your receipt.  And then you're holding your bag open like, I hope I get away with this.  It's like, wait a minute.  I paid for everything.  Yeah.  You almost feel guilty as he's looking through your stuff.  Yeah.  You can.  Yeah.  I don't know where we're going.  You guys got any new jokes for you? 
[02:44:30]  Nah.  What?  Jimmy's the comedian.  I'm just a fucking lackey.  No, no, no.  Not really, no.  I just kind of just fire out nonsense in here.  And on stage, I'm a total dud.  No, you're a fucking great comedian.  I do mediocre crowd work.  Oh, you rich boss.  There's that old comedian's trick of like, you'll say something about somebody and you  go, oh, look at this guy going.  Yeah, get me too.  With the comedian.  You're like, no, no one's saying that.  Fucking asshole.  He's cracking up over there.  He's cracking up.  He's cracking up.  I got it.  Look at his office.  He got it.  What did I say? 
[02:45:00]  Four sale signs all over my neighborhood.  Oh, that was during the dot-com thing.  That's probably what you're talking about.  Oh, see?  I'm not a good reader.  It does say 1999.  1999, it looked like a bloodbath that really taught me to be safe in my portfolio.  It was a bloodbath in Seattle.  That's smart, though.  You can't go volatile these days.  People were buying huge, putting half of their dough, their savings into some companies that 
[02:45:30]  had P.E. ratios of 2,000 to 1.  Just take it to Vegas.  You have a better chance of going red.  Poof.  34.  Let me double my money.  Yeah.  Just odd.  Hey, Duff, can you do us a favor?  Yes.  There's a guy.  His name is Eastside Dave.  Oh, you know Eastside Dave.  I know Eastside Dave.  Okay.  Dude, he attacked him.  How did he forget him?  I forgot we gave you one of the greatest memories ever.  That's really not one of the greatest memories. 
[02:46:00]  He had a son last night.  He did.  Oh, did he?  And he's a, I mean, there's no bigger fan than Eastside Dave.  No, he is a big fan.  I just don't, I, I, and a congratulations Eastside Dave on your, your, your new son.  That's just great.  His name's Stan.  Stan.  Didn't you say Dave?  The boy's son.  The boy's name is Stan.  Oh, Stan.  Yeah.  Young man, Stan.  But, but Eastside Dave, you know, I just don't get you.  I mean, if you're such a big fan, that whole thing of shoving a banana up your ass to show 
[02:46:30]  your, your love of rock is, is not really the way to do it.  But, guy like me.  Go with a watermelon next time, he's saying.  Yeah.  That would actually prove something to me.  What would Stan think when he grows up and hears about his dad doing things like that,  right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess, you know, tattoos aren't good enough, you know, if you, it's like you gotta shove 
[02:47:00]  a banana up your ass.  God, we horrified you.  It's obvious.  Well, well, you know.  He said Dave did.  Yeah.  We didn't.  But it was our show that it happened on.  I was sitting, I was sitting quietly.  Exactly.  I just ate the banana.  I didn't do anything.  It just made me hungry for some odd reason.  He could have done a Gigi Allen, so it could have been worse there, though.  And started to throw it.  It's a really, that's just shades of the same blackness, right?  You know, you eat your own poo, or you put a...  Did you know Gigi Allen, or did you think, like, because I've watched Hated, and it was  a weird, like, musically, I couldn't enjoy it. 
[02:47:30]  I'm a long music guy.  I'm a, always been a kind of a music dude in Gigi Allen.  Although, okay, yeah, whatever.  Okay, you are punk rock, quote unquote.  That wasn't really punk rock to me.  It was just a guy.  Just a guy doing kind of performance arts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was more gimmicky, wasn't it?  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't, I listened to the music.  I tried to, like, you know, I just, like, ugh, it's terrible.  There's nothing there.  I didn't like it.  I wouldn't say that if he was here, though, he'd probably throw razors and shit at me.  He's dead.  He was here.  He was a zombie.  And you'd have to shoot him in the head.  Good old Merle with the backwards Hitler mustache. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  The only time Gigi Allen was nice is when he met Johnny Cash.  That was the only time he showed reverence.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  When he just pissed on him.  Yes.  He gently dumped Tinkle on the man in black shoes.  That sounded so poetic, the way you put that.  Yeah.  Well, we want to hear some music when Duff's ready.  I don't know if he's ready.  You know, he's just hanging so we can look each other in the eyes while we're doing this.  Yeah.  You need the microphone turned around, or what do you need, Duff? 
[02:48:30]  You tell us.  You don't know?  Should have had another mic, like, set up, but...  Well, welcome to...  We have another mic right there.  Does Duff need that right there?  Or no?  Oh, look at that.  Does that work?  Can we set that up?  Is it plugged in?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  That would probably take forever.  Why would we know?  Oh, okay.  Duff, they might be able to do it in a second.  Hold on.  Let's just see.  They might be able to do it right for you.  Right.  Yeah, it's kind of like...  Oh, you got to turn on.  What happened?  Why don't you just turn that on?  Make sure it's working.  You got to get in what they call circle jerk position, so you can all look at each other. 
[02:49:00]  Really?  You know, Jim.  No eye contact.  I don't play in a band.  Duff's looking at you like...  I've actually never heard it called circle jerk.  Yes, it is.  I don't know where you're from, pal.  Well, good punk band, though, circle jerk.  Yep, very much so.  See?  We turn it right back around there, Duff.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what we do.  Thank God you got me out of that one.  Yeah, I'm trying to help you out.  I'd love to see Duff just kickbox your teeth out.  You know how that would make me?  So, this is a song.  It's not the single off the record.  It's a song we played. 
[02:49:30]  Mike and I went out and did a little bit of radio, and we played this at a station, a terrestrial station in Cincinnati.  And that station took this song, and it's a ballad off the record, and they put it in rotation, and they got...  Now it's in top five power rotation at the station, and it's brought this song to, like, number 35 on rock radio.  Just one station, that's how many times they spin it. 
[02:50:00]  Can you do us a favor, after you play it today on our show, just say, Opie and Anthony made this record huge for us?  What do I say?  Opie and Anthony made this, you know, song huge for us.  Yeah.  I will.  Basically, you forget about what Cincinnati did.  Okay.  Exactly.  Dr. Johnny Fever.  Did I just do, like, a radio note by saying that?  No, it doesn't matter.  Not long.  That's actually really cool.  That's a cool little story.  Yeah, we just kind of found out about it a couple days ago.  Nice.  We played rock on the range, which is a big...  Well, let's be honest.  It's still Cincinnati. 
[02:50:30]  Well, I'm not making any judgments on any of that stuff.  Look, man.  Look, man.  Wow, did you get threats ever?  Oh, yeah.  Is that an understatement?  From his staff.  Another one?  You're looking at two of them right now.  All right.  Duff McKay and loaded.  Yeah, this is Wasted Heart.  Two, three, four.  One, two, three.  guitar solo 
[02:51:00]  guitar solo 
[02:51:30]  Sleepless nights 
[02:52:00]  I drug you through  When I say the things  I don't mean to  Yeah, you stay there with me  You uncover this outlaw's soul  Should have gone, baby, long ago 
[02:52:30]  But you shine the light  When it was dark  On my wasted arms  When I flew  You pulled me down  When I crashed  You were the ground 
[02:53:00]  When my bones are scattered all around  Yeah, you stay there with me  Oh, you uncovered this outlaw's soul  Should have gone, baby, long ago 
[02:53:30]  But you shine the light  When it was dark  On my wasted arms  My wasted arms  Needed hailing  And you saved it for me  I got a new start 
[02:54:00]  Rest your eyes in time  These days will say  What I never could  What I never could  You stayed with me 
[02:54:30]  You uncovered this outlaw's soul  Should have gone, baby, long ago  But you shine the light  But you shine the light  Where it was dark  But you shine the light 
[02:55:00]  Where it was dark  Should have gone, baby, long ago  But you shine the light  Where it was dark  On my wasted arms  On my wasted arms  On my wasted arms  Oh, oh, oh  Are you kidding me? 
[02:55:30]  That was really, really good  All right, I'm in  I'm in with your band  I'm in  Seriously, that's what  Just put it over the top for me  I'm in  Great  It's all about Loaded  Duff McKagan's new band  That sounded great 
[02:56:00]  I had an early Stones feel to it  I hope that's a compliment  No, it's totally a compliment  Yeah, the record is really  We're old school  In that we like to make an album of songs  You know, when you used to put on a record  And it was like  From the beginning to the end  And the record really is  It's a journey  A lot of songs are harder  Maybe a bit more  You know, we're a little left of center 
[02:56:30]  Than mainstream rock  For sure  But it's a real rock and roll band  That had a great sound  I mean, and the harmonies are fantastic  Amazing  And just, you know  Wow  Look, you got us all serious, though  That was really good  Like, we're going to cry or something, man  I wanted him to keep just playing it  Yeah, it was really good  I appreciate it  Rave reviews on the Instant Feedback  Oh  And you can see Loaded tonight  I want to get the plug out again  Gramercy Theater  East 23rd Street  In New York City tonight  And Twitter Duff  At Duff64

That was great, dude  That really sounded good  I'm downloading this freaking loaded CD  That sounded great  For real?  Yeah, yeah  Definitely  We've gotten really, really  Do you rock too?  Or you keep  No, we rock  So it's a little of everything?  That's what we do  We rock  We do jokes  All right  We do jokes  Sometimes 
[02:59:00]  We drink a lot of Red Bull when we play  So, you know  You start to kind of tweak a little bit  Yeah  You get loopy  You get a little loopy  Yeah  Yeah, so jokes  That Red Bull's dangerous  Holy shit  We mainly, mainly, yeah  Rock hard right in your face  And  So you guys are not acoustic live?  No, just right here  Right here  Just for the opening  Sounds great  Don't you think Red Bull is equal to cocaine?  Yes  No  Thank you  But I don't do funny things, you know, like cocaine 
[02:59:30]  I would do things  At least you don't grind your teeth down  Yeah, and Red Bull doesn't shrink your dick like a mushroom cat  Anybody fucks on coke  No, no, that was  Really?  You could do it  My dick was worthless  Worthless  Really?  Yeah, it was like a knuckle  Like a knuckle  Really?  Yeah, horrible  You know what it is?  Yeah  With coke it was always, yeah, kind of little  But then once you did get hard, you could fuck all night  Yeah  But you really had to like work at getting  You were doing the old, you know, shoving it in the side 
[03:00:00]  Just to get it in there  So the point is, on Red Bull, none of these things  And those demented thoughts, those demented sexual thoughts  Right  Although, I don't know if those ever  And when you talk, there's actually substance  You're not just babbling about nothing for hours  I don't know about that  I don't know about that  Wait, you think the Red Bull  There was one gig in particular in England or somewhere that we played recently  And I realized I'd been talking for a while  Not sure what I said 
[03:00:30]  And I stopped myself  And yeah, that's the audience  What I just said  But the band rocks hard  And we mean what we do  You don't even have to sell it  Instant feedback  Our listeners are a bunch of assholes  They'll openly admit that  And no one trashing you  No one  I think we might have some friends out tonight  I know, that is fucked up  No, for real, no one  Because it doesn't matter who's played in there  In here, somebody is always like  This fucking sucks  But everybody is

Oh, nice  Oh, Dan  Nice  Ron  Ron  Hell of a guitar player  Yeah  Nice  Like, plays fretless guitar  I don't even know how to play a fretless  What does fretless mean?  It has none of these  None of those in there  Figure out yourself  It's like a violin, you know, or a cello  It has no frets on it  It's just, there's none of these things  Jimmy doesn't know that  None of the lines  None of the  Oh, okay  These things  You see those?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  They call those frets  Okay  He didn't know what a spit valve was on a 
[03:02:00]  I would have  My musical  On a tuba  But I know what post-op means  You want to talk?  Hey, I like that  Of course  Well, there are websites dedicated to spit valves  There he comes  See, he's coming alive  He's coming  Okay, so that  When you're learning guitar  Where the frets are  It's like, you kind of know  You have to go up to this  Oh, it's your guide  It's just, yeah  It's like having  But guys like Ron Bumblefoot  Can play  He's a virtuoso guy  And, yeah, he can play 
[03:02:30]  Like, it's like a cello  But it's a guitar  And you have to figure out  You have to know  And I don't know  I don't even know  It's fucked up that you have to know  Exactly where you're putting your fingers  Like with frets  You got a little leeway  You're in the area  Yeah  Now your finger is actually  Making the string shorter  Instead of the fret  Yeah, you get it  You know what's going on  That's fucking tough, man  Are there like a bunch of  Like how many frets are there  Like when you're reading music  I don't know how to read music  Fretts are  I don't either  I don't know how to read music  So like, what is it?  Is there like 15 frets? 
[03:03:00]  Yeah  21 to 24  21 to 24  And like when you read  Like let's say go to the 8th  Then the 7th  Then the 6th  Is that how that works  When you're telling someone how to play?  That's good enough for me  Good  That's what I  Tablature  Tablature will show you by fret  Okay  It's different than actual reading music  Alright  Just use a computer  We should fucking go on there  Get some loops from Mac  What's going on for you?

[03:03:30]  Coming back with a vengeance  We thought it dropped off  You know  It dropped off in the news for a while  Now it's like coming back  Yeah  You know, had a couple of fatalities  Well, that was a good  It drew a lot of people to the news  So they probably had to  Yeah, so they pumped it up  They realized  Wow, look at our ratings  When we did this  We've got to do it again  We've got to do it  We've got to do it  California thing  It slowed down  Yeah, this California thing  They've got to find some  Actually, they should  Try to find some porn  Yeah, yeah  I think they did  They found some lingerie shots  And then they found 
[03:04:00]  That's not porn  They found some  They want a fisting video  I'm talking about  A point of view  Hey, we've got a  Pretty cool phone call  Coming in  I don't know if this is true  But Mike in Queens  What do you got for Duff?  Yo, what's up, man?  Oh, hey, wait  Hold on  Duff's got to put his headphones on  If this  Supposedly, Duff  You wrote a  Go ahead, Mike  You talk to Duff  Duff, man  My uncle was  Johnny Thunders  You were saying  So fine about him  On Use Your Illusion  I'm nervous  To help right now, man  Your uncle is  Johnny Thunders 
[03:04:30]  I just wanted to tell you  Thank you, man  That meant so much  To my family  You know, I meant  I was freaking out  Yeah, I dedicated  So fine to Johnny Thunders  A huge influence  For sure on my guitar  Playing since I was  12 years old  Who did he play for?  New York Dolls  Oh, I agree  And then he had his own  Solo career  That was  I actually got to jam  With him once  I played drums  I was probably 16 years old  And it was 
[03:05:00]  You know, he's just  One of those  Influents  He influenced Steve Jones  Who was in the Pistols  Yeah  And Steve Jones' guitar playing  Really influenced  A whole generation  If there wasn't  You know, so it's  You could say  If there wasn't  Johnny Thunders  There wouldn't have been  Metallica  Right  Or Guns N' Roses  Or, you know  Onward to now  So, he's a guy  That didn't get  A ton of recognition  But he was  Definitely a trendsetter  And a hell of a hairstyle 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, he was  The coolest looking  Motherfucker there ever was  That's for sure  Do you know Steve Jones?  He had a radio show  Out in L.A.  It was a good show  And I did it  When I was out there  And he was great  And I didn't know  That he was in the Sex Pistols  I had no idea  Until the end of the interview  Really?  I had no idea  I just thought he was  A cool radio dude  And we just talked about  Craigslist for an hour  What a fucking filthbag he is  He's great  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  He was great  Oh yeah  Yeah  We just talked about  All the ads  What was the song? 
[03:06:00]  Oh, if you  I'm sorry  Go ahead, man  Hey, no, it's cool  The name of the song  Was so fine  Oh, okay  And then on  Spaghetti Incident  I covered  Which was a Guns record  Yeah, sure  Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory  Which is a Johnny Thunder song  My mom actually has  It was my mom's brother  My mom actually has  A platinum album  Of the Spaghetti Incident  Oh, she does  Yeah, made out to her  From the record company  Yeah  And it's something that  She was really proud of 
[03:06:30]  I don't need to get upset, dude  Oh, look at  He's getting all upset  It meant a lot to my mom, man  Dude, that's great  You know, thanks, guys  For me  It's still real for me, damn it  It's a thing, man  It definitely is a thing  Well, it's odd  You get a chance  To talk to the guy  Who, you know  Who had such an impact  Exactly  But buck up, you fruit  Jesus, man  Let him have his fucking emotion  He's making him laugh  I'm just fucking with you, man 
[03:07:00]  The problem is  He gets very uncomfortable  With real moments  Yes  Just so you know  It's all good, dude  You sound like me  When the spaghetti  Hit the wall  When my father threw it  And my parents  Started fighting  Just having a real moment  All right, Mike  There are a don't buy  Spaghetti incident  There are certain people  In the room  I'm not going to say  Who they are  Who may have adult children  Have alcoholic issues  I don't want to  Pointing fingers  Well  Why is there a spotlight  Going on  Over Anthony's head  Right now  Sam, I know  Oh, yeah  Thanks, guys  I appreciate it, man  Thank you, man

I don't know  Holy shit, Jimmy  No one needed to ask that question  What do you got  You took that call  And didn't figure that out  No  Are you out of your mind?  Maybe I'm not that perceptive  The guy gets all emotional about it  They're talking about  Like how good he was  Oh, all right, okay  Past tense things  Holy shit  Well, he could have been a guy  Who just retired from music  And didn't play anymore  Or he could be stupid  And very imperceptive  Of anything  The question, actually  Is how did he die? 
[03:08:00]  No, I didn't know  I don't know how he died  Duff  Overdose  Oh, shit  Shit  If it wasn't a direct overdose  It was certainly something  That had to do with it  Yeah  I'm the same idiot  That asked Vince McMahon  How's Gorilla Monsoon  Not knowing that he was dead  And then I asked Gene Simmons  About Star Stull  The chick he posed  Remember that  You're like  We interviewed Gene  Ten years ago  And he's like  Gene's one of your idols  Ask him a question  I'm like  How's Star Stull?  She was the Playboy Bunny  That he did the motorcycle  Chopper photo shoot with  And he goes  And they laughed 
[03:08:30]  And he goes  That's not funny  She's dead  I'm like  Oh, good  Great  I didn't mean it  I didn't know she was dead  A bunch of people are asking us  To play Dice's kids band  For Duff  See what he thinks  You know Dice?  Andrew Dice Clay?  Yeah, yeah  I've met his kids  Have you heard their music yet?  They live like three blocks  They live like three blocks from me  In L.A.

[03:12:30]  I just kind of joked my way out of it  Yeah  MySpace.com  Slash loaded  To learn more  I'm in  Cool  Great  I'm so in now  Yeah  That song was amazing  I can't wait to, you know  Hear the rest of the album  And then that's obviously on the album  That song  Wasted Hearts on the record  Yep  And the single that's being played at radio right now  Is called Flatline  And we're going  We're finishing this little stint  In the States  We're going to end in Kansas City, Oklahoma City  And Des Moines  And then we fly to Europe 
[03:13:00]  And we're playing Download Festival  That's awesome  The big rock festival's over there  I know we've got to get you out of here  But Velvet Revolver  I have to ask  Because people are asking  Yeah  New lead singer?  No, no  No  There's no closer  There's, you know  There's either you have them or you don't  And we've heard some great guys  Just haven't found that  Oh, look at the band getting sand behind you  I'm sorry  No  They both look down  No, no  It's not that we've  No, no  There's none of that  No, I already got passed over for the gig  Me too 
[03:13:30]  We're trying to do it  Both of us  You know, it's a dirty damn shame  That we don't get Mike Squires on the radio more  Because he's entertaining  You know what, though?  If this loaded thing goes to the next level  Then you know what?  You don't even have to worry about the Velvet Revolver  It's all about loaded  That's what I say today  That's what I say  That's what I say  Duff's a multitasker, man  He can do lots of stuff  Apparently so  He's ready  We'll put a video cam on the bus for you  Yeah  What do I do?  Yeah  That's where I finally go to sleep on the bus 
[03:14:00]  All right, we've got to get Duff  Anyhow, okay, enough of that  Hey, Duff, thank you so much  Always a pleasure to see you  Is he still the governor?  No  No  No  I don't know  He is insane  Yes  And he's still very large  Yeah  So you can't call him that  No  Don't  Oh, he'll see me out in the lobby now, though  Yeah, you shouldn't have called him insane  Oh, no  I don't think Duff said that  Well, as we walk out, I'll say that to Mike  Why'd you call Jesse  You said Mike goes flying  From the 36th floor window  It was a Navy SEAL 
[03:14:30]  All right  All right, we've got to get my head  We'll have Jesse in here in a minute  Yeah, quick break  And we'll get Jesse in here  Opie and Anthony  It's the Opie and Anthony show  Very, very busy day today  In studio, Jesse Ventura  Yes  Promoting Don't Start the Revolution Without Me  On paperback  Oh, out on paperback  That's right  Oh, you came around when it was out originally  Now  Then they make you do it again  When the paperback comes out  You've got to come out and do all the shows all over again  And that's part of the obligation of when you write a book  If it's successful enough and makes it to paperback 
[03:15:00]  You're happy to do it  Because it means the book was a success  If they take it to paperback  And you've got to write extra pages, too  Because you've got to give them a little extra, right?  Yep  So I updated it now  Because, of course, I wrote the book  And the epilogue of the book is complete fiction  I write fact all the way to the epilogue  And then I switched over to fiction  Without telling you  Oh, really?  It becomes a murder mystery  And I had to kind of remove that  Because I did a fictional piece  Saying that martial law  That I and Robert Kennedy Jr. are running for president 
[03:15:30]  And that martial law is declared here  And they suspend  Because there's an attack of six of our cities  And they suspend the elections  And then I wanted to kill myself in the book  But Dick Russell, the guy who wrote it with me  Wouldn't allow it  So I end up in a coma  Why wouldn't he allow it?  Did he like those too depressing?  No, he probably wanted to do another book with me  Which we're now doing  So he figured if I  See, I created Jesse Ventura  So I felt I had the right to kill him  Oh, that's true  You know, since I created him  The public image of who he is 
[03:16:00]  Then who would have the right to kill him  Other than me  And that's what I kind of wanted to do  Because when I moved to Mexico  I had no intention  Really of going into the public eye anymore  It was like a getaway to go down there  Now, obviously you spend a lot of time down in Mexico  I gather  Yeah  And you enjoy what down there  As opposed to being here?  Well, first of all, the weather  Well, I'll do that  You know, you notice that I'm a lot tanner  Than all you guys are  Yes  You guys look pretty pale to me  Yeah  Like you need some sun  But then again, in New York City 
[03:16:30]  The sun's hard to reach you here  You've got to look straight up  Just to see the sky  This is true  Yep  And so, but I also  I've taken up surfing  I used to do a lot of body surfing  And boogie boarding  But now I'm trying to make the transition  At this late time in my life  To board surfing  Yeah  And it's very difficult  It's a dedication  I often like to say this  Surfing is a lifestyle  And you must be completely dedicated to it  Imagine if you were that dedicated to religion 
[03:17:00]  Would they call you a religious bum?  Surf bum  No, they call us bums  You're a surf bum  I don't like that connotation  Because it's a dedication  And a lifestyle  It's a light  Like  Like I tell people  Here's my life in Mexico  I can tell it to you in one sentence  I wake up every morning  With nothing to do  And when I go to bed at night  I'm half done  You can't  But you can't compare surfing to religion  Because of the connotation  Surfing has done nothing  But commit horrific acts and violence 
[03:17:30]  All over the world  And murder people in its name  Oh yeah  And religion don't do that  Exactly  No one's ever been murdered over religion  What needs to be said about Mexico  You're off the grid  You don't own a cell phone  You're an hour from pavement  And you're an hour from electricity  Electricity  Wow  You pedal a bike  And I went from the governor's residence to that  Imagine  Is it a nice house at least?  Oh yeah  Beautiful home  Yeah  And the taxes are marvelous down there  I bet  No you know what my taxes are 
[03:18:00]  I have a three bedroom  Three and a half bath  With a casita on the back  I have my own swimming pool  Thirty of my own palm trees  And it's all encased in a wall thing  Two and a half car garage  My property taxes down there  Are four hundred bucks a year  Wow  Wow  And get this  Now here's the better part about it  They get it and we don't  And I'll state it this way  At least in Minnesota  Now I can't speak for all the states  But I'll speak for the one I govern  In Minnesota  The government and taxation 
[03:18:30]  They penalize good behavior  And reward bad  Case in point  Your home  If you buy your home  Fix it up and make it better  Like a good citizen  Right  How do they reward you?  You pay more  You pay more  So by using their analogy  You should buy the house  Let it go to shit  Be the worst house on the block  Then they'll reward you  You'll pay less  You know something?  I agree with Jesse  Yeah absolutely  Do you know how it works in Mexico? 
[03:19:00]  This is embarrassing  We should be embarrassed up here  Do you know how property taxes work down there?  There they reward good behavior  Your property taxes are due in March  If you agree and pay them in January  They knock off 20%  If you pay them in February  They knock off 10%  March is normal  And then the fines start  Well I pay mine on January 28th  Of course February is a shortened month  So in 30 days  I'm getting 20% on my money  Tell me where I can do that legally 
[03:19:30]  Now we should be embarrassed  That their system  Is so much superior to ours  Down there  They reward good behavior  As far as yes  You pay early  You pay early  You're rewarded  As far as that goes  You're very true  You're very right  I agree with that  But there are some downsides  Oh certainly  Of living in  Well maybe not living in  And especially you  I mean you obviously have the means  Oh certainly  To buy something nice down there  There are a lot of impoverished people down there 
[03:20:00]  Oh absolutely  But the thing that's good about it  When you go to Mexico  It's understood the government's corrupt  See we're on an ego trip up here  We kind of like to think our government's not  I got news for you people  We're as corrupt as any Mexican government  It's just that they're open about it  Down there you know it  By the way  I have a get out of jail free card  I've been pulled over twice by the federalies  You know the federal police  Where they kind of hold you up for money 
[03:20:30]  All I do is pull out my governor's ID  And say I know Presidente Fox  And Presidente Colón  You just have a warning  Go ahead  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  I've done it twice  I bet that works  Two times  You worry about crime down there  Because Giuliani didn't even want to go  Without his own security  Do you have security with you  Never  No  I'm safer where I'm  Are you kidding me  I've seen old women  Walking along the roads  Where I live  Where I'm  I'm in far more danger  In Minneapolis, Minnesota 
[03:21:00]  Than I am in Mexico  Where the danger is in Mexico  Is the borders  And why  Well let's go back in history  Who created the border towns  We did  The United States  We created Tijuana  Nueva Laredo  Nogales  And all them crappy  We're on serious radio right  Yeah you curse  So I can curse  We created all those shitholes  Right  Do you know how  The prohibition of alcohol  When we prohibited alcohol  Everybody that wanted to drink 
[03:21:30]  Went over the border to Mexico  To drink  Well there came the prostitutes  There came all the bullshit  Now  The same holds true today  You have violence at the border  I remember  Remember  We all remember  The Virginia Tech murders  Yeah  Okay  Do you know what the headlines were  That day in the Mexico papers  It said USA 33  Mexico 20  It was like a sports score  Because on that same day  Mexico lost 20 of their people  At the border  The difference is  Ours only happens once a decade 
[03:22:00]  Like Virginia Tech  Theirs is a daily thing  And why  Because of the illegality of drugs  And the prohibition  That's what  If we want to stop  All the killing  Then stop the prohibition  It seems to me  In our country  We're more fearful  Of marijuana  Than murder  Because we're condoning  We're prohibiting marijuana  Which is causing  All the murders  Is it marijuana though  Or the cocaine traffickers  Are the ones  That tend to be really violent  It's all  It's all of them  Because it's all lumped together 
[03:22:30]  With the cartels  Do you want to legalize  Cocaine also  And all the drugs  Well when you speak  Legalize  Let's remember  I think marijuana  Should be treated  Identical to liquor  Absolutely  Because I'll tell you  It's less  I agree again  With Jesse  In fact it's a lesser  Of a drug  Of course  Because how many kids  Do we hear at college  Who binge drink  Every year and die  We hear about it  Every year  Yet you can't smoke pot  And die immediately  Smoking  Now you might die  In 40 years  From cancer  Maybe from inhaling 
[03:23:00]  The smoke  But it's not going  To kill you  That night  There isn't enough  Weed in the world  That could kill you  In one night  It's also a personal  Choice you're making too  If you want to smoke it  And take the rest of your cancer  You should be able to do it  Absolutely  Now so to me  Let's bring  I think Franklin Roosevelt  Said it at the end  Of prohibition of alcohol  And I think it's a great quote  He said  I can't feel my legs  No, no, no  Not quite  He said  We can no longer afford  To prohibit alcohol anymore  I say you switch alcohol 
[03:23:30]  And marijuana now  And say we can no longer afford  To prohibit marijuana anymore  Right  I saw  You know those little stores  In LA  Where they sell the medicinal  If you've got a script  Medical marijuana  I saw a story  Where they went into the guy  Now it's all prescription  And it was a guy  In a wheelchair  Runs a little shop  About as big as your studio  Right here  And they asked him  They said  How much did you pay  With prescription only pot  In sales tax  To the state of California 
[03:24:00]  Last year  You know what he said  300 grand  Wow  Now if it was legal  Like liquor  He would be saying  A million  Now in these economic times  Isn't it smart  To get a new revenue source  Schwarzenegger's actually  Saying that though  You in a way agree  I think Schwarzenegger's  Kind of toying with that idea  So you actually agree  With all that  He's in a desperate spot  Right now  Exactly  Our whole country  Is in a desperate spot  Apparently  How great would it be  That marijuana  Saves this country  Well it won't save it  But it's one of the 
[03:24:30]  Building blocks  If you can get more  Revenue coming  One thing is not  Going to solve the economy  You're going to have to  Have about 30 things  To solve it  But this could be one  How much more  Of the predator cast  Is for legalizing pot  I would say all of them  Oh right  Just checking  I would say Sonny  Would have to be for it  Sonny Landon  I wouldn't think  Sonny would have  No problem with it  I don't think  Carl and Bill  Would have a problem  With it  Bill Duke  And Carl Weathers  Seems like he might  Poke a little bit  Shane Black 
[03:25:00]  Who wrote Lethal Weapon  I don't think  He'd have a problem  With it  I thought I was  A little curious  On that one  Elpedia  Now I don't know  Elpedia Carrillo  The Mexican girl  I don't know  What Elpedia's  Spot would be on it  Get to the chopper  Very good  I like that  I like that  Get to the chopper  Now we gotta get  Into something  Because I'm agreeing  With you on  Everything you said  So far  But now there are  A couple of issues  Jesse where I think  We part ways a little bit  And what might that be  That would be  What I heard  He's talking about 
[03:25:30]  On Larry King  About Guantanamo  And the  Insurgents  The victims  The tortured people  The bad guys  The terrorists  The poor guys  Whatever you want  You know  Depending on which side  Whatever they're being called  The Muslims  This day  Muslims  Well we only seem  To waterboard Muslims  Well when they're  The only ones  Crashing in the building  Oh not true  Well  Timothy McVeigh  And Nichols  Why didn't we  Waterboard them  Well we kind of  Knew they did it  Yeah but many people  Felt there were  More people involved  Shouldn't we have  Waterboarded them  To find out 
[03:26:00]  But we can't  Can we  Because it's  Against the law  We could execute  One of them  They were covered  Under the constitution  Of the United States  Of America  Right  The insurgents  The victims  Whatever you want to call them  They should be too  But they are not  Yes they are  They are  Our country  Is our country  But it's  You go by the rule  If you don't follow  The rule of law  When it's convenient  You must also follow it  When it's inconvenient  Torture is illegal  But there's a difference  No there is not  There is a difference  Between people 
[03:26:30]  American citizens  Protected by the constitution  And wartime prisoners  That are  That are protected  Not protected  By  By what?  The Geneva convention  Exactly  But  But  They don't qualify  For that either  Only because  That's what the torture  People are using  As semantics  To get away with it  It's just like  When they call it  Enhanced interrogation  Right  Oh what a neat word  To come up with  That you can substitute  For torture  Well it is a shame  How many people 
[03:27:00]  I've been waterboarded  I heard  I know that  Yeah  And it's torture  John McCain  Has been waterboarded  He said  Isn't it ironic  That the guys  Who have been waterboarded  And the guys  Who have actually  Served their country  Are opposed  To the torture  And it's all  These pukes  Like Dick Cheney  Who got five  Deferments  From the Vietnam War  He's all for it  And creates it  Because he never  Had to put his ass  On the line  Did he  Shouldn't it be  On the table  Shouldn't that  Be on the table 
[03:27:30]  At least as a threat  No  For information  No  Because the information  Is fraudulent  That's why  I made the quote  You give me  Dick Cheney  A waterboard  In an hour  And I'll have him  Confess to the  Tate murders  I understand  Because when you're  Being tortured  You will say  Whatever it is  To stop the torture  So there's no  Credibility  To what  Why do you think  It's not allowed  In the courts  But the  But  But  The threat  There are no buts  The threat of a torture  Let me tell you 
[03:28:00]  Okay  When you go public  Then we stoop  To their level  Don't we  I'm not saying  What's next  Should we  Lop some heads off  I'm not even saying  Torture them  But I'm saying  To publicly say  This is what we're  Never going to use  Takes a tool away  It's called the tool of fear  Not actually torturing  Let's say  Believe me  I'm not even for that  But I'm talking with you here  I know  Why would a president  Or anybody else  For that matter  Say  We're never going to use this  It's a bad thing  To tell the opposition  What you're taking 
[03:28:30]  Off the table  Regardless if you use it  Or not  Because  That puts us above them  But by being above them  And if we stoop  To their level  We're no better  Than they are  But you know something  We are  Because when  No we're not  When we bomb places  We have to make sure  There are strategic strikes  No we don't  Are you kidding me  How many civilians  You think have died  In Afghanistan  And Iraq  Plenty  From our supposed  Surgical strikes  Because war isn't perfect 
[03:29:00]  Unfortunately  That's right  We can't just kill  The bad guys  That's why it's war  And it's bad  And that's why  We shouldn't be  In either one of them  But I'm saying  Afghanistan too  We shouldn't be in  No  Why  Al Qaeda  Are the people  They could have  Turned him over  No no excuse me  We went to war  With Al Qaeda  Because they supposedly  Would not turn over  Bin Laden  That's all they did  Al Qaeda  That's all they did  We said to Al Qaeda  Turn over Bin Laden  Al Qaeda said no  And that's why  We're fighting 
[03:29:30]  The Taliban  You mean  Yeah or the Taliban  Excuse me  The Taliban  Yeah they were  The head muckety mucks  Lopping off heads  And doing whatever they do  But don't you think  That somebody had to be  Held responsible  And I know some of your  Theories on 9-11  They're not theories  They're questions  In our country  You're not allowed  To ask them anymore  You have theories though  No no I have questions  I have questions  That's all  Not theories  I have questions  Your take on what happened  Is not what the official line is 
[03:30:00]  Right  You feel  Well I follow  What Thomas Jefferson said  Dissension's the greatest form  Of patriotism  Mm-hmm  Yeah  So I dissent  I question my government  I agree with everyone's right to do that  Absolutely  But why does everyone get angry  When you question 9-11  People get angry at you  And they call you names  And they do all this stuff  And all I do  There's things about 9-11  That are very peculiar to me  That whole day was a bit peculiar  Yeah  Like  And I do have a background 
[03:30:30]  I think in demolition  I was trained by the best guys  We have in the country  And when I look at those buildings  And I see how the cement  Was pulverized to powder  What type of energy could cause that  Not a simple fall  Well it wasn't  Not a simple fall  Yeah  They said one floor  Pancaked into the other  And down they went  A lot of weight  Well how would that pulverize  900 tons of cement  Into dust  People are questioning  I think  Because you do have  The demolition background 
[03:31:00]  The Navy SEAL background  How come it was like  On September 12th or 13th  Like you kind of came out  A couple years later  And I think that's what  People are questioning  Like there have been  So many theories about it before  Because at the time  I was governor  I didn't have time  To question it  When you're governor  That's a full time job  Believe me  And so it was after  I got  You know what made me  Question 9-11  Here's what did it  After I got out of office  And Bush said  We're going to invade Iraq  I stepped back  I went  Iraq  Wait a minute 
[03:31:30]  The 19 guys  They told us  That did this  There wasn't one Iraqi  Right  Why are we going  Into Iraq  And that's when  I started to question  I said  Ooh what's the real  Big picture here  What's the real big picture here  But you could question that  But it doesn't have to  Necessarily tie into 9-11  It could tie into  It could tie into  Saddam Hussein  Trying to kill my daddy  That's pretty much  What I think  The point is  All of it wouldn't have  Happened without 9-11  That was a catalyst 
[03:32:00]  Because he was able  To use the fear  Of terrorism  And potential threat  Of Saddam Hussein  Which turned out  To lie to us  To lie to us  I'm not going to  I'm not going to  Disagree  That was the weapons  Big lie  Big lie  But  Well if they'd lie  About that  Wouldn't they lie  About other things  Just because I lie  To one thing  Doesn't mean I'm  Lying about a murder  I could lie  I stole something  It doesn't necessarily  Mean I would lie  For something more  Important  Well alright  Let's go back  To my generation  I'm a Vietnam vet 
[03:32:30]  Now I remember  When the President  Johnson got on TV  And told us  Our boys are  Floating in the water  For the Gulf of Tonkin  Incident  Which is what got us  Into the Vietnam War  Where 58,000  Of my generation  Were killed  Probably a million  Vietnamese killed  Who knows how many  And they've now  Come out and said  That wasn't true  It never happened  Now if they would  Fraudulently  Build up the  Gulf of Tonkin  Incident  To get us to war 
[03:33:00]  You think they  Wouldn't fraudulently  Take us to war again  In that fashion  I'm not too sure  About that  Really  In the fashion  Of taking down  Two huge  Very symbolic  Buildings  Killing a lot of  Innocent American people  In that fashion  No  And the demolition  Thing  I like to  Because you say  You're in demolition  I was trained  By the best  You know what it  Takes to wire  A building 
[03:33:30]  That size  For demolition  Not much  How would you do that  In a working building  Easy  Let me explain  When I see them  Demolish buildings  They're drilling  Holes  They're planting  There's wires  Great  First of all  The World Trade Center  Had construction  Going on  On a daily basis  Every time  Every time a tenant  Moved out  They had to redo  Whatever floor  They were on  And I learned this  From guys that  Worked there  They said construction  Was an everyday thing 
[03:34:00]  Construction workers  Would walk in and out  Absolutely  All the time  You want to know  How to do it  Be the UPS man  Show up with your  Brown truck  You got access  To every floor  You can carry boxes  Up to any floor  Who's going to ever  Question  You're the UPS guy  And plant enough  Explosives  Convertly  To take down two  Buildings that are  A hundred stories tall  Do you know anything  About the modern demolition  I've seen many  Do you know what  Super thermite is  Do you know what 
[03:34:30]  Super thermite is  No but I assume  It would be a very  High temperature  It's a highly  Explosive demolition  That you can put on  Like painting the walls  It doesn't  It doesn't become  A demo  Until it dries  And it can be made  Into paint  You could have people  Painting super thermite  Right here in the building  And they wouldn't  Even know it  I would love to see  A demonstration of it  Used to take down  Pillars of cement  I can show you  Super thermite  Without drilling  Into the superstructure  I can show you  Super thermite  We just did it 
[03:35:00]  For a  For a  Pilot I'm doing  On True Channel  We showed super thermite  Simply painted onto  I-beam steel  And detonated  And it burned  Right through it  I-beam steel  Can I ask you a question  Just about 9-11  I would almost believe  Conspiracy theorists  Why go  The government  Let me just ask you  Why wouldn't they just  To go through all that  And go through the planes  Why wouldn't they just  Bring the buildings down  Take two trucks  However they do it  Get them into the basement  If you can bypass 
[03:35:30]  The security at the airport  If you can do all that  You can get trucks  Into the basement  You somehow make a proclamation  That Saddam Hussein  Has said he is going to  Attack a major New York City  That day  You drop both buildings  You A-kill a lot more people  You B-remove almost  All of the X factors  That can fuck you up  Like a plane not taking off  Because of mechanical failure  And you give the entire  American public  A galvanizing reason  To go into Iraq  Like that is so much simpler  And so much easier  To control  Why wouldn't they  I mean if they 
[03:36:00]  I don't know  Why not something simple  Why four airplanes  And possibly more  And then you leave  Zacharias Moussaoui  To be tried  It's embarrassing  You know there's a  There's a lot of  Unanswered questions  And that's my point  Why is it that  When you ask questions  About 9-11  You're immediately attacked  Why aren't you allowed  To ask a question about it  If something  If you saw something  That you don't understand  Which there are many things  I don't understand that day  Why June 1st 
[03:36:30]  Did George Bush  Do an executive order  Changing how we respond  To air attacks  Up until that point  Base commanders  Were left to their discretion  Whether we sent jets up  And that was  That happened like  170 times a year  Jets would go up  In the air  Yet June 1st  Through an executive order  No jets were allowed  To go in the air  Unless it was cleared  Through Donald Rumsfeld  At the DOD  So in essence  You could have a stand down  Simply by Rumsfeld 
[03:37:00]  Not answering his phone  Because no one had permission  To go up in the air  Where was our air defense  That day?  Here you had four  Commercial hijacked airplanes  Covering two to three  Four hours of time  And we didn't have  One jet in the air  Yet  Go back to when  Do you remember  Payne Stewart  The golfer?  Yeah  Okay  Payne Stewart  Took off from Florida  In a private plane  They went up  And lost contact  Within 20 minutes  They had a fighter jet  Up on the wing  He said 
[03:37:30]  They're slumped over  I can't raise them  They appear to be dead  He followed them  To Nebraska  Or whatever  When they didn't hit Omaha  He let them go down  Well this was a private plane  Out of Florida  And we had a jet up there  Within 20 minutes  Here you've got  Four hijacked planes  And not one  Let's look at  Let's look at  The government's theory  And I call  There's a theory too  They've never proven  Any of this  But Jesse  You're saying four planes  Not to interrupt you  But you're saying four planes  You remember too 
[03:38:00]  They were up  And it was very  Very quick  Like when the one plane  Went up  A bunch of stuff happened  A lot of people  The air traffic control  Wasn't exactly sure  What was happening  And the next thing you know  It's flying  Because ironically  We were holding war games  That day  Now did the terrorists  Know this  And if they did  Who leaked it to them  How did they know  To do it on a day  When NORAD  Is running these huge war games  Where it would confuse  All the air  Remember the quotes  From the air traffic controllers  Is this real  Or is this part of the war game 
[03:38:30]  They didn't know  Now that fits bad  For us either way  Because either  It was done intentionally  Or the terrorists  Got inside our government  To the point of knowing  When we run war games  But didn't they call  So somebody's not  Doing their job here  The plot was called  Porsche 911 I believe  So they knew that  They were going on  September 11th  So you're taking into account  If the government's involved  And there's war games involved  Bad weather  Ruins your entire plot  That's why I don't  I believe that the 19 guys 
[03:39:00]  Caught this country  With our pants down  And they used  Lact security  Let me ask this  How were they able  To identify these guys  Within 24 hours  And yet not able  To stop them  They had pictures  On TV  Yeah  They showed us pictures  Because they didn't  Try to hide themselves  They were on the manifest  Their names were on the manifest  Really?  Who's seen the manifest?  The government won't  Release the manifest  When have you seen them?  Well I haven't seen the manifest  No one has  No one has  The government won't  Release the manifests 
[03:39:30]  Why?  Alright let's go to the Pentagon  The Pentagon has over 200 cameras  That run 24-7  Why did the government  Confiscate all those cameras  And why are we not allowed  To see the plane hit?  All you see is this little flash  That they allowed you to see  Yet the Pentagon has cameras  All over it  And how was that plane  Able to circle  For 40 minutes  In a no-fly zone  And not be shot out of the air  Question  And then you got  And then it ties in 
[03:40:00]  When Cheney was down  In the bunker  And Mineta  The transportation secretary  Testified to this  In open 9-11  He said  A kid walked in  And said  Mr. Vice President  The plane's 50 miles out  Mr. Vice President  The plane's 30 miles out  Mr. Vice President  The plane's 10 miles out  Do the orders still stand?  Mineta tested  And Cheney snapped around  And said  Of course they still stand  Have you heard anything contrary?  Well what orders 
[03:40:30]  Are we talking about here?  And if he knew  And was being  A report  That this plane  Was approaching  The pen  Or approaching  Washington D.C.  Why weren't buildings  Being evacuated?  Why wasn't it being  Shot out of the air?  Well maybe  A lot of questions  Like that  They did handle it terribly  But I don't think  It was handled horribly  That's implying  That the Vice President  And the President  Know a plane  Is being crashed  And they're going  Well the plane's  On schedule  To hit the Pentagon  Hold on  Now here  The plot thickens  Now Bush was down  At that school  Right? 
[03:41:00]  Talking to the kids  Right  And remember the  Seven minutes  He sat there  Frozen in the classroom  Right  Alright  The Secret Service  Is under the  Department of Justice  They don't even  Take orders  From the President  If they feel  The President's  In danger  They whisk him  To safety  Now the President's  Trip to Florida  To that school  Was a photo op  So it was well  Documented  He was going  To be in that school  Card comes up  To him  And tells him  A second plane  Hit  We're under attack 
[03:41:30]  Now planes  Are flying  Into buildings  Two of them  Have done it now  Why did the  Secret Service  Allow Bush  To sit there  For seven minutes  When for all  Purposes  A plane could have  Been bearing down  On that school  At the very moment  That he was in there  Who would know  We're under attack  From flying planes  They knew he was there  He should have been  Whisked out of that room  Immediately  But it was almost  Like they knew  I just think  We had this perception  That we were 
[03:42:00]  Protected a lot better  Than we actually were  We always had this  Perception that  There were missiles  On top of the White House  And things would happen  If something like this  Ever happened  But you know something  We just were not  As prepared  As we would have  Liked to have been  And like Jimmy said  So a memo  On August 6th  That said the exact  Thing that was  Going to happen  While our president  Was vacationing  In Crawford, Texas  The memo of August 6th  Said exactly 
[03:42:30]  Osama Bin Laden's  Planning to hijack  Planes and fly them  Into buildings  And it was  I can tell you  I can tell you something  Oh yeah  Had I been the president  9-11 might not  Have happened  Because I would have  Responded to that memo  I wouldn't have  Gone on vacation  To Crawford  The other investigator  That went down  To the flight school  And spoke with people  That said this  Gentleman is  Trying to fly a plane  It's very suspicious  He doesn't fly very well  He's not concerned  With the landing  Not only that  Like that  That to me  Is evidence also  That this guy 
[03:43:00]  Is a Middle Eastern  Gentleman  That was flying a plane  And pulling up  Red flags  Let's look at  The actual hijackers  Now Osama Bin Laden  Is a purist Muslim  Who goes by  The old traditional Muslim  We'll all agree to that  Right?  Whether you agree  With what he believes in  What do you mean  The purist  The purist  He's a Muslim  Who believes in the faith  Like we're the infidels  We should be out of their country  And all this  I think Al-Zawahari  Is more the  Is more the 
[03:43:30]  The strict religious guy  Than he is  Okay well  Both of them then  Whatever  But these guys  That hijacked  They were not strict  To the faith  They were going to  Stripper bars  They followed him  Well  They were following orders  Whether they're  But if you're going to go die  And you believe in Allah  And you believe in the purity  And the sanctity  Of the religion  And you're now going to die  Wouldn't you live cleanly?  They're not very rational  If you're going to take a plane  Yes  And fly it into a building  So  They're flying civilians  Into a building  But you're not listening to me 
[03:44:00]  These guys don't fit  They perfectly fit  No  They were  No they don't  They were fanatics  Perhaps not as religious  As you would think  They would be  If they're going to fly  Into buildings  But you've got to be  A little kooks  Cuckoo to fly into  A fucking building  With planes full of people  So  You know  Perhaps they weren't  Strictly adhering  To this  Muslim faith  I would  If I were a  Religious person  Well if I was 
[03:44:30]  That religious  And you know  You're going to die  Would you want to  Offend God  Right before you die  I wouldn't think so  They obviously  I didn't look at it  Like that  I think they're hatred  Well you can't  Obviously say  What they looked at  Sure you can  Because they behave  That way  Yeah  So they weren't  See to me  They're not the followers  Of Bin Laden  And them  Because of their behavior  Let me  I want a question  For you this  9-11 was 75% successful  According to what  They wanted to do  The passengers  Overtook that final plane  Once they all knew  For a fact  What was happening 
[03:45:00]  I don't believe that  I know you don't  Cell phones don't work  That high then  But they were low  They weren't flying  At 30,000 feet  But let's just say  Let's say for the sake  Of argument  That the passengers attacked  If the pilots  Are not trained  To open that door  And negotiate  If those doors are locked  And that the first sign  Of trouble  They allow that woman's  Throat to be cut  And they do not open  The doors  9-11 doesn't happen  Alright  Here's another one for you  You got four experienced  Pilots that were  Flying these planes  Like the guy  That flew to Pentagon  Plane  Burlingame  Former Top Gun  Tough as you can get  Now 
[03:45:30]  They have a thing  On all commercial planes  Where all you've got to do  Is punch in some numbers  And it's a code  That you're being hijacked  Why did none of the four planes  None of them  That number was never punched in  Probably because they were smart  The way they did it  They would attack the stewardess  And the pilots were trained  To open the door  And negotiate  Which is so horrible  But they still would hit that  Before they would do anything  It doesn't require any words  All that does  Is send out to everyone  Who needs to know  We're being hijacked  Well didn't  None of the four planes 
[03:46:00]  Did that  Well didn't  Didn't the stewardess  And a guy like  Like Burlingame  Guys that knew him  Said he would never  Give his plane up  He would die first  So then how did they get it  I don't know  I don't know  I don't know  He might have died first  Yeah but he was a tough guy  He was a karate guy  Top and self defense  All this stuff  When you got a guy  A box cutter  A box cutter  Oh yeah  Box cutters are real dangerous  When you got a guy with a box cutter  To a girl's throat perhaps  Then the guy isn't going to  Charge in and start fighting  Knowing that somebody's life is threatened  You got to look  In hindsight 
[03:46:30]  Well let's remember now  If you think these planes  Are going to fly into the ground  And everything like that  You're going to do whatever  You have to do  Okay  Here's what we have to believe then  And which all of you do  That 19 Islamic hijackers  Armed with box cutters  Defeated  Our multi-billion dollar  Air defense system  That the Soviets couldn't  And the threat of a bomb  And the threat of a bomb  The Soviets couldn't do it  But these 19 guys  All while taking orders  And conspiring with a bearded guy  In a cave in Afghanistan 
[03:47:00]  Yeah a billionaire  A billionaire who has funds  And who has a network of people  That's right  He's not some broke guy  That's right  He's a construction billionaire  Yeah and there is  And in fact you're correct there  Because his brother Salem  He helped bail out George Bush  On one of his horrible  Business ventures  They're the oil families  I don't even disagree  Oil families are a very  Small group of people  In this world  Exactly  And George Bush is part of it  Oh he is  He absolutely is  But he didn't orchestrate  In 9-11  So dislike him as much as you want  I'm not saying he did  I know 
[03:47:30]  I'm just saying that  If they didn't orchestrate it  I believe that they  Didn't do much to stop it  19 guys  Caught the U.S.  With their pants down  Because they took  First of all  They had the threat of a bomb  Which everyone  What threat of a bomb?  They said they had a bomb  People were calling  On their cell phones  Saying that these  Muslim guys  Or whatever they said  Or Arabic guys  Have hijacked us  And this is coming  From people who are on the plane  And they said  They have a bomb  That's how they stopped  The mutiny from the passengers  How did they get the bomb  Through security  They didn't  There was no bomb  Exactly 
[03:48:00]  And you'd be that stupid  On the plane  Wouldn't you  If you were on the plane  I would think  Jesse you're different  You're not a businessman  On your way to L.A.  To do something  No I'm a governor  Nah but you're also  A fucking wrestler  And a Navy SEAL  You think differently  Than the average citizen  No I don't  Yes you do  No I don't  Regular guys aren't  6 foot 5  Pre 9-11  Pre 9-11  Your mindset  If you're a regular  Average Joe flying  Was if some  Fucking shenanigans happen  I'm going to sit in my seat  Shut up  And hope we land 
[03:48:30]  And they you know  Deal with this problem  Because it had never happened  Because it hadn't happened  If they knew  Right off the bat  That they were flying  Into buildings  You would do everything  You could  Every old lady  You'd be scratching  Frigging eyeballs out  That's I think  The mindset now  Is what you're thinking  But it's hindsight  The pilots would have  Done something  You tell me  They couldn't have  Dipped that plane  They knew they were  Going to be flown  Into buildings  They would have  Dipped that plane  And dropped everybody  They would have  Loved the air pressure  If you want  Anything  But  No it had never happened  You negotiated  They would ask for the freedom 
[03:49:00]  Of political prisoners  And you would land  No one had ever flown  Passed your planes  Into buildings  And the shitty intelligence  The lack of communication  Between the FBI  And the CIA  That was all terrible  That was all terrible  But that doesn't mean  That it was a conspiracy  By the US government  You got your ideas on it  And questions like you said  I'm not saying it is  I'm just saying that  What troubles me  In this country  Is that on this issue  You're not allowed  To talk about it  But you are  No without weight  Without people  Insulting you  Now you guys are different  But I get  You get insulted 
[03:49:30]  You're right  You get called  Rosie O'Donnell  I've been called that now  Because I  Hey it's Opie from  Opie and Anthony  And that does it for us  We're done  Go find someone else  To entertain you  We're done  Ron and Fez  Yeah they're up next  Alright hooray  On the Virus  XM202  Sirius 197  Tell her about BU 
[03:50:00]  A storytelling  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I absolved you  And that's why  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  You're Cooper </pre>
