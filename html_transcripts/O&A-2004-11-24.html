<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opens with Ari Bikowski's "ACC Today" sports report, covering college basketball.  The hosts then return from a break, reflecting on their past behavior and numerous absences at WNEW. They complain about their current studio setup and recount a near-career-ending incident involving a homeless man, "Tippy Tom," who became intoxicated and engaged in explicit on-air self-pleasuring.  Audio clips of Tippy Tom's actions are played, and the hosts discuss their fear of the consequences had Tippy Tom died on air.  Listener calls follow, including one listener who faced workplace repercussions for listening to the show.  The segment concludes with further discussion of Tippy Tom, promotion of "Whip Him Out Wednesday" (WOW), plans for a Philadelphia sticker giveaway, and complaints about the lack of promised marketing support from XM Satellite Radio.  Highly offensive language and descriptions of sexually explicit acts are prevalent throughout. A call with Heather from Connecticut, involving a "Guess What's in My Pants" segment where she rubs a phone against her genitals, is cut short by technical difficulties.  The hosts subsequently make numerous sexually suggestive and crude remarks about Heather and her body, leading to a heated exchange with a male caller who objects to their comments about larger women.

The hosts then discuss Viacom's $3.5 million indecency fine, including their portion, and debate the FCC's definition of indecency, referencing racial slurs and the St. Patrick's Cathedral sex stunt.  They play audio of prank calls to O.J. Simpson and discuss listener-created video games based on infamous events, including graphic and offensive depictions of the Kennedy family.  The show features descriptions of various listener-submitted video game ideas and again promotes the Philadelphia "Wow Sticker Stop" event.  Multiple XM Satellite Radio commercial breaks occur.

Opie recounts a traffic stop involving drugs, leading to discussions about his driving infractions and speeding.  A caller suggests a "Sex for Sam" game, prompting a William Shatner joke about his wife's death. Another listener suggests a Sonny Bono-themed skiing game, leading to Opie and Anthony sharing their own drunken skiing experiences.  The hosts then announce Viacom's $3.5 million settlement with the FCC, including $357,000 in fines for them, related to the "Sex for Sam" segment and a sexually suggestive "Drew Boogie" remix.  News reports confirming this are played.  The show features three attractive women in the studio, employees of "Ziggy," resulting in leering comments from the hosts.  A crude song about the FCC is sung. A discussion about an overweight woman suing a movie theater for small seats leads to a rant about victimhood culture and obesity.  Thanksgiving plans and crude humor about bodily functions are shared. Club Soda Kenny calls in, promoting his appearance on HBO's *Inside the NFL*.  Opie and Anthony discuss their upcoming appearance at a club with tribute bands (including their brother's Journey and U2 tribute bands), playing audio clips.  Ralphie May joins the show, discussing his weight loss surgery, upcoming shows at Caroline's, the Pacers-Pistons brawl, and R. Kelly.  The segment concludes with further comments on the three women in the studio, including a humorous exchange in Greek.

The show continues with a chaotic and sexually charged atmosphere, featuring multiple female guests, including "hot Greek women," "Di," and "the retard Laverne and Shirley." Ralphie May remains a guest.  The hosts interact extensively with the women, focusing on their physical attributes and using explicit and derogatory terms.  They discuss "Master Poe," a martial artist outside the studio engaging in suggestive behavior with a woman. Master Poe joins the show and performs a staged demonstration, subduing another man with a towel.  A song about Jimmy Robinson and his imaginary childhood playmates, with graphic sexual and violent details, is played.  The band Wolfpack arrives, leading to anticipation for a "Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge" involving potentially dangerous activities.  The hosts mention more women and suggest escalating the show's sexually explicit content, culminating in a planned segment showcasing "hot lesbian action" with Wolfpack and other guests.  The broadcast heavily features sexual comments, bodily function humor, and offensive and derogatory terms towards the guests, while promoting XM radio.

Two women from Wolfpack, who perform in nude shows, are present with Opie, Anthony, and Ralphie May.  The Wolfpack women engage in sexual acts with a rabbit vibrator, described graphically.  This is followed by discussions and demonstrations of other activities, including kissing. Ralphie May makes jokes referencing these acts.  Master Poe participates in extreme stunts, including being hit with a thumbtack-studded wiffle ball bat and having staples put in his tongue, resulting in significant bleeding.  An attempt to involve the show's intern in sexual acts with one of the Wolfpack women fails due to the intern's discomfort.  A "wiffle ball bat challenge," involving women inserting the bat into their vaginas, follows, accompanied by graphic descriptions and commentary. The segment ends with more sexual acts, punctuated by advertisements for XM radio, Ralphie May's show, and other products.  The hosts consistently use vulgar and offensive language throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Boyd, we're prohibited.  He shoots.  ACC basketball.  It's the ACC Today.  Tie your shoes nice and tight.  Because ACC basketball is breaking you down.  You better box your man out,  because we're grabbing the boards.  Round ball, baby.  It's the ACC Today on XM Satellite Radio.  Cut off the ricochet.  It's Wednesday, the 24th of November, 2004.  I'm Ari Bikowski with the ACC Today.  How about ACC basketball? 
[00:00:30]  Some big games have been going on.  UVA knocking off Arizona on Sunday.  Right side, J.R. Reynolds.  Reynolds got a little room.  He goes to the block and gets it out.  Devin.  Devin rotates up top.  Good.  17 feet away.  It's good for a deuce.  The Cavs lead by 10.  71-58 with 10 with 9 seconds on the shot clock.  Right side, Singletary going right.  Giving it up.  J.C. with 5 with 4 to Devin Smith with 3.  Devin to the hole.  The fadeaway.  Yes!  Man, that's about as good as you can draw it up. 
[00:01:00]  Virginia Sports Network and the Cavalier Sports Marketing on the call.  The Wahoos smoke Arizona 78-60.  The Duke Blue Devils played some games.  They last took on Davidson, who gave the Blue Devils a little bit of a shakedown.  Trouble gets it away.  The ball tipped into the backcourt.  Where it's run down by Shadlick Randolph.  Two seconds on the shot clock.  Ewing Dockery fires.  Mason!  Whoa!  A three-pointer just inside mid-court.  Who says he can't shoot?  And a missed travel there.  Kosmoski finds a three way outside. 
[00:01:30]  Duke Radio Network on the call.  The Blue Devils survive 74-61.  Duke's next contest is against UNC Greensboro.  It's this Saturday on ACC Channel 180.  Now, Georgia Tech, they had a close call against Illinois-Chicago.  They next take on Arkansas-Little Rock this Friday on ACC Channel 180.  Pre-game at 6.30 p.m. Eastern.  Game time around 7.  And that's the ACC Today on XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:02:00]  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.  XM Satellite Radio.  Radio to the power of X.  XM News, talk, sports, and information.  It's everything, all the time.  XM 202.  XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:02:30]  XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:00]  XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  The virus is out. 
[00:05:30]  I repeat, the virus is out.  Throw the first switch.  Sentence served.  Get ready.  Get set.  Permission to freak out.  Go.  We're the talk of the industry.  Ask me.  That's the way it's always been. 
[00:06:00]  The outcast of radio.  Bastards.  No one truly wants our radio show.  No one has balls in here.  Your balls are showing.  Big, beefy, hanging, swinging nuts.  Throw the second switch.  Wow, this is even better than I imagined.  Love you, Alfie.  Love you, Anthony.  Boy, we're gonna have great fun.  Love you, Ben.  Love you, Steve.  I hope you brought a big bag of smiles.  O-N-A.  O-N-A.  You two are going to hell.  Shut up.  Kill yourself.  Throw the third switch!  O-N-A, the virus is spreading. 
[00:06:30]  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tics.  Stay out the bushes!  Stay out of the bushes! 
[00:07:00]  Do you mind if we dance with your dates?  Days never did it!  Master got me working!  Someday Master took me free!  What?  What?  It smells like crap out here!  You're full of what?  There's always one clip you play that just gets me going, bro. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah!  Good morning!  This is the O-P and Anthony show, the O-N-A virus spreading across America.  What's wrong, Anthony?  Nothing.  I was just looking around the studio, and they seem to have done a good job cleaning and disinfecting it.  It is spotless.  Feel good?  It is germ-free.  You want your mic up or down?  Just a tad up.  There we go.  But it's all about me!  It's all about me. 
[00:08:00]  Oh my God.  Where do we begin today?  A lot of people thought we were off today.  Really?  We had two years and four months off.  We're not taking much time off.  We don't have the juice to be taking days off.  No, not how many days off we used to take at NEW.  The drop of a hat, we were off.  We would walk in.  We were at work sometimes.  And we would decide, we're not going on the air today.  Remember that?  Right in Ken Stevens' office.  Right in our boss's office. 
[00:08:30]  We'd be like, I don't think it's a good idea to do a show today.  Yeah, we would come up with all sorts of things, you know?  Excuses.  And I'd be like, oh my God, he bought it.  I'm going home.  You know, the gag order that Howard put on us in the show?  That gave us at least two weeks of vacation.  Yep.  Because some days we're like, you know what?  I don't know.  You know, Ken, if we go on the air today.  That's right.  We did use that a lot.  Remember, like, if we go on the air today, it's going to get really, really ugly.  It wasn't even like that.  I do believe that we need a day off today to kind of just rethink this whole situation. 
[00:09:00]  You know something?  You make it sound so logical.  You never said it like that to Ken.  It was always, Ken, if we go on the air, I'm not guaranteeing anything.  I don't know what I'm going to say.  I don't know what I'm going to say.  And he was so nervous and he wanted to do this job.  He was like, well, I see it your way.  Why don't we go take a three-hour sushi lunch and talk it over and you guys can go home and rest?  Pop on a best of and we'll, you know, come back tomorrow with fresh heads.  All right.  I think by the end of our tenure at WNAW and Viacom and Infinity Broadcasting, 
[00:09:30]  I do believe we were up to about eight weeks of vacation.  Yeah.  We would just take days like that.  All of a sudden, Howard would say something on his show.  I hope you and Anthony are a couple of clones, Robin.  Right.  And we'd go into the office with Ken and go, you hear what he said?  Well, you know, we've got to respond.  We're not a couple of clones.  You know we've got to respond.  And Ken would be like, but Mel said if you respond, I'll be fired.  Yeah, well, I can't promise that we're not going to say anything. 
[00:10:00]  And you know what?  Screw that dump button.  We're going to tie up everybody to make sure this goes out on the air, Ken.  Perhaps another day off.  And then Ant and I would be playing golf on Long Island somewhere, all happy.  Done.  There would be days we'd come in all hungover from the night before,  and we'd just come up with an excuse why we need to take that day off.  Another old best of running.  I know.  As we're just gallivanting around.  We truly called in that show for a while there.  Maybe it is all for the best. 
[00:10:30]  Maybe it happened all for the best because we were just on autopilot.  So now we're attempting the biggest comeback in radio history.  That's right.  And we know we can't take a lot of days off.  No.  At this point in time.  We probably would have taken the whole week for Thanksgiving.  Oh, easily.  The whole week.  Easily.  You know, Ken, I don't know.  Howard kind of looks like a turkey.  It's Thanksgiving.  We'll probably wind up saying something.  Oh, my God.  You guys take the day off.  Just take the day off.  Just the whole week.  Go ahead.  My job is safe for another day. 
[00:11:00]  You guys, if you need to, you go take that day off.  You regroup.  You know, come back January 1st.  It's a new year.  We'll start out new.  Remember that one?  We'll start fresh.  Ken loved it because he didn't have to worry that day.  I know.  I know.  It was a constant worry for him that we were going to do something.  We definitely took, I think, close to two weeks off right around Christmas all the  way through the new year.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But no, we're here the day before Thanksgiving.  That's it.  I'm surprised we don't have to work Thanksgiving. 
[00:11:30]  We were thinking about it.  We'll be here all alone.  Someone will come in with a plate covered in tinfoil.  Here you go.  Brought it from home.  Oh, with a cranberry sauce and gravy and potatoes and stuffing.  That's why I love being at XM Satellite Radio because we know where we were when we blew  it up and now we know that we have to get back to that point.  That's it.  Eventually.  So we're hungrier.  We're working harder.  We're coming in here early.  We'll be here tomorrow to play Alice's Restaurant for you at noon. 
[00:12:00]  No, we will be taking tomorrow and Friday off.  But no, it's cool about that Friday.  Wow.  Well, we have a lot of new listeners that haven't heard the show yet.  Yeah, I know.  And we got a lot of great highlights.  So I think this is a good time to, you know, step aside for two days and just kind of play  best of us and get everyone caught up.  We're going to play the Monster Rain thing.  We're going to play the poker chip incident.  Maybe the Tippy Tom stuff from yesterday.  Who knows?  For the people that got their radios today. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, you missed the benchmark show.  Imagine the people that just flipped on their radio right now.  It's their first day with XM Satellite Radio.  First day with the Opie and Anthony show.  And they're like, all right, what's this show about?  Not even knowing what they missed yesterday.  Yeah.  And knowing that we gave our listeners a great show yesterday.  Yeah.  Today we're going to kind of be mediocre.  We're just going to jerk off today.  You said I could jerk off on a stage.  On a stage? 
[00:13:00]  It's a console.  Oh, it's hilarious.  It wasn't good enough that the homeless guy was whacking off over there.  He wanted to whack off on, I guess, officially, this is our stage, Anthony.  All the world's a stage and we are merely here to jerk off on it.  What, Tippy?  What?  This is our official stage right in front of us.  It's our stage.  All right.  We ought to put a little curtain.  He named it.  Which means all these light fixtures are going to have to come down.  Yeah, that light right there is just bad.  That's a problem.  It's got to be raised up to the level of the ceiling, I think. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, definitely.  I think this whole circular thing that hovers over our heads like a spaceship has to come down, too.  Give us an extra six to eight inches of headroom.  Yeah, you know, we've been a little too nice to XM Satellite Radio down there in Washington.  Ben, tell them we need some more adjustments to our state-of-the-art studio.  Get the hacksaw.  We're not happy yet.  We need that gone.  We need the UFO thing gone.  Because now this, because of Tippy Tom, is the official Opie and Anthony stage.  I like that.  We could have girls going around, you know, all morning long giving lap dances and we have our little dollars. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, and then have the girls that kind of aren't on stage yet.  Yeah.  So when they walk up, you could look and go, oh, well, now I've got to hang out because she's coming up.  We should get a little jukebox in the corner where they're trying to pick out their music.  Yeah.  I don't like this one.  Like the old ones?  They could be up on the stage here and yell, could you eject this one?  Right.  I don't like this one.  Yeah, they take themselves out of the game because they don't like the song.  That always sucks.  And then they cover up.  Yeah, they cover up.  I don't get that.  Could you reject this song, please? 
[00:14:30]  And then they kind of talk as they're covered.  I really don't like this one.  Right.  It doesn't move good enough.  And then House of the Rising Sun starts up.  Oh, okay, I like this one.  Rug act.  And then they uncover their boobs again and then continue with their dance.  Some Def Leppard will come on and then, oh, I love this song.  Off comes the clothes again.  Yeah.  Yeah, what are they going to cover up when they're chit-chatting with you between songs?  I don't know.  I don't know.  All covered.  Yeah, I was just looking right into your whale eye.  What about the small talk just before the lap dance where they talk about how they're 
[00:15:00]  going to school?  Yeah, it's always.  Or, you know, they're, yeah, it's mostly about going to school and you have serious conversation.  Then the song starts and that's the song you paid for.  So now they give you that F me dance, like I want to F you like you've never been F'd before.  And they're really grinding away and just really getting into it.  Song ends and it's like, so anyway.  I got to be out of my apartment by next week.  It's like, damn, dude.  You're like, oh, yeah.  And as soon as the song ends, it's not even like a fade out, you know? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, my landlord's such a fucking asshole.  And you're just looking like, do I want to even hear a piece of this?  I could have went home for this.  Hello?  Just shake your ass and shut up.  I really don't care if you're going to be a lawyer someday.  Show me your sneet.  Like clutching that little lingerie to her boobs like, oh, don't look.  Right.  I'm not on the clock right now because the song isn't playing.  Right.  But I'll chit chat with you.  God forbid you dance after the song is over for a few seconds. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, my car broke down on the way.  I had to call a friend and like they were working.  So who care?  Yeah.  Did I even care?  Right.  If you're going to say that, at least uncover your boobs.  I don't care.  Uncover.  I'll just stare at your nips as you tell me about your car problems.  Right.  I want to hear it.  Someone wants to bring up the Ken Stevens thing.  Let's go to Matt in Philly.  Hey, Matt.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What up?  Hello.  I just got to say, I love the logic of the show. 
[00:16:30]  You guys are talking about how Ken Stevens was all panicked and worried about you guys.  Isn't that really what got him fired?  Yeah, we are talking about a guy that was eventually fired over something we did.  Yeah, you're right.  I guess he had every reason to just.  But we milked it for all it was worth.  I'm not kidding you.  There were days I would look at Anthony.  I'm like, do you want to do a radio show today?  He's like, eh, not really.  I'm not feeling it.  And, you know, we're so huge.  And our listeners, you know, think we don't do anything wrong.  No, I'm just kidding with you guys.  But, you know, we're like, some days we just weren't feeling it. 
[00:17:00]  We're like, all right, what can we tell Ken today?  Yeah, what are we going to tell Ken?  We can't just tell him we're not feeling it.  It was always about just confessing.  I really don't know what we're going to say or do today, Ken.  It's going to be, I'm telling you, to your face, if we go down the hall and go into that studio and turn those mics on, I don't know what's going to happen.  Ken, if we hit the air, I'm just going to say, there might be a problem.  Right.  Might be a big problem.  We really did run that place. 
[00:17:30]  Humble, humble, humble.  We ran that place.  Could you get a best up together?  Right.  We already got it.  We already have it.  It's already together.  It's running already.  Right.  Running now.  It's running now.  We will see you tomorrow.  Yeah.  We're going to take tomorrow off, too, and we'll start fresh.  We said that so many times.  We'll start fresh on Monday.  We'll start fresh Monday.  Monday, Ken, we can promise you we won't do anything Monday.  Right.  We'll actually make you that promise.  So he can have a good weekend with his wife.  And he's like, oh, good.  All right.  This is good. 
[00:18:00]  We're deciding to work Monday.  We love Ken.  He went down with the ship, and he still defends us to this day.  So speaking of which, Anthony.  He actually did pretty good because he doesn't have to deal with any of the bull.  Oh, look.  They're doing a story on.  There we are.  Oh, wow.  Look at us looking all tired and fat.  There we are on Fox 5 News.  That's the one we got?  Yeah.  Do we have that one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to get into why we're all over TV today.  Look at little Opie on my, me adjusting my head.  Oh, look at us in our old studio when we were kings. 
[00:18:30]  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  Isn't that odd watching us?  Of afternoon drive radio.  Oh, look at you with a cup of coffee staggering out of the studio.  That wasn't coffee.  That was probably Jack Daniels.  Probably the big tall boy.  Boy, that's odd doing radio, watching TV of us doing radio.  I know.  That was very odd.  Big story today, Opie.  You ever listen to a radio show and DJs are watching themselves on TV doing radio?  It's like looking into a mirror with a mirror behind you. 
[00:19:00]  I know.  It kind of went on forever.  Yeah, we'll get into that in a second.  But before we put the Tippy Tom thing to rest, I do have to point out, and you'll hear it on the replay over the weekend, I'm sure.  I think we're rerunning, basically the replay schedule for the weekend is going to be Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.  These three live shows.  Monday, Wednesday, Thursday.  And then Thursday and Friday are going to be best of shows, and all of these shows will run during the weekend.  Because people have been asking, okay?  So, Tippy Tom, I want to make this perfectly clear.  I. 
[00:19:30]  This is no bit.  I thought that Tippy Tom was dead.  Yeah.  So did I.  I have to say it.  So did I.  I have to say it.  Wouldn't have been out of the realm of possibility.  And listen to the replay.  I have a panic in my voice, and I'm not saying anything, because I'm staring through that glass at Tippy Tom, and they're raising his arms like this, and there was nothing.  There was no reaction.  The arms are just falling hard to his sides.  Then they did it with his head, and it's just, there was no muscle action whatsoever.  His face was purple.  His face was like, yeah.  But it turned out to be the lighting and the dirt on his face. 
[00:20:00]  But it looked like I thought he was dead.  Because he came in here, did what he did, sang some songs, he was completely hammered, and then we're like, all right, that's fun.  We've got to do all this shit.  Yeah.  So we sit him out there for like two hours, and then we casually go, oh, go wake up Tippy Tom.  It's time to have him perform again.  Yeah.  And even Keith.  Keith's smacking him.  Even Keith, who has seen a lot of dead people in his career.  Yeah.  And he even tried the pulse thing, because I'm like, oh my God.  And Keith puts his two fingers on his pulse and takes his pulse.  He had the rubber gloves on, so it might have been tough. 
[00:20:30]  Because then he looked up and shook his head, no, like, uh-oh.  He goes, I don't, this isn't good.  Oh, boy.  And I'm like, you can't have a guy die on our show.  Because that will be the end of our radio career.  That's pretty much it.  Do you guys understand what you're listening to here?  Do you guys understand the show you're listening to?  Is it our last chance?  F'd up twice.  We're only going to get one more shot at this.  Yesterday was almost the day that our careers were over.  Yeah, because once the news caught wind that somebody, a homeless guy, had died doing our show, 
[00:21:00]  there would have been a problem.  Opie and Anthony kill homeless guy on their show.  There's no coming back from that.  No, not after all the other crap on our record.  We have a record.  They would love to get, imagine the smiles on their faces when the story came across their desk.  Wait a minute.  Opie and Anthony, those guys, they killed someone on their show?  This is the best story ever. 
[00:21:30]  Same guys that may believe they killed the mayor?  Shock jocks Opie and Anthony go too far.  This time, killing a homeless man on their radio program.  And that's how it would be reported, too.  Oh, of course it would.  Killing a homeless man.  Dude, they would be drooling to get that story out.  So enjoy this show.  Opie and Anthony back on the air for just a couple of months in trouble again.  Right.  Killing a man on their program.  Right.  Shock jocks gone too far.  That's pretty much the ultimate shock jock thing you could ever do, though. 
[00:22:00]  That pretty much ends everything.  Well, it's going to happen.  So enjoy this program.  Spread the virus.  Tell your friends we're back on the radio, because some media outlets have no idea.  Yeah.  Because the next time we do mess up, it's over.  I'm telling you, it's over.  I got home and my girlfriend said, she goes, when that part came up where you guys thought  Tippi Tom was dead, she goes, I got so nervous for a little while there.  Because, you know, she'd been through the whole thing with me, knowing what it's like.  Right. 
[00:22:30]  And just after a couple of months on the air, to have to go through that again?  That's what was going through my head.  When I looked at Tippi Tom, it wasn't, oh, the poor homeless guy's dead.  It was like, oh, my God, we're going to have to do this again.  We're going to have to go through all the press again.  We're going to get fired again.  It would be awful.  Right.  I could give a crap about the dead homeless guy.  All right.  Let's say hi to Steve on Long Island.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, what do you have?  I just woke up this morning, and Fox News in New York was doing a story on how you and 
[00:23:00]  Howard were going to be facing longer delays and stuff, and they called you guys Opie and  Andy.  Opie and Andy?  Isn't that wonderful when they do that?  Isn't that fantastic when they do that?  That's great.  It's a good news service.  That's great.  We're going to get into all that in a few minutes here.  Let's say how to build a cop in Colorado.  What's up, Bill?  Not a whole lot, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I just kind of want to let you guys know, you guys are the best and the worst. 
[00:23:30]  I got in trouble yesterday.  I was on a traffic stop, and technically we're only supposed to have about 10 minutes  per stop.  I was on there for about 15 to 20 minutes, and they called up and said, what are you  doing?  And I said, oh, nothing.  And I got back in, and they seen I just rode a speeding ticket, and that was it.  Oh, they were pissed.  They said, what were you doing?  Well, I didn't want to tell them, but I was sitting there listening to Timmy Tom wanted to  jerk off, and I just could not get out of the car.  I didn't want to miss any of it.  Oh, very cool.  Yeah, so last night, I got home.  I bought a Mi-Fi, or I should say a pre-order Mi-Fi, and bought a tuner for my personal vehicle. 
[00:24:00]  Look at this.  The guy bought all sorts of XM equipment because Timmy Tom was jerking off on our show yesterday.  I've been listening to you guys since the Wednesday that you guys started, and it's just been  great.  And the first thing that got me hooked was when you guys had the Tourette syndrome called  a whorehouse.  Oh, look at that.  I pulled over, man.  I was hurting so bad I was laughing, and inside of a vest sweating, it sucked.  Well, we're going to play that going into break in a little while for you. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, man, that's great.  I appreciate it, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Bill.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  You know, and the other thing I want to explain really fast, yesterday was one of those famous  Opie and Anthony clusterfuck radio shows.  Yeah, we love it.  We have many different radio shows that we do.  Some are very intelligent and highbrow.  We try to stay away from them.  And some are just, the other side of the spectrum is just a cluster F that we have given up all  control of the show and just let it all fly out there.  Yesterday was one of those shows.  We also call it Trainwreck Radio, Cringe Radio. 
[00:25:00]  When you've got a homeless guy, naked, spreading his ass cheeks in front of girls, and then  cranking his knob, I mean, it was ridiculous.  That was the only time I was glad the show had to end.  Oh, I know.  Because we're still trying to figure out how we could go over 10 o'clock.  Yeah, sometimes we get to the end of the show and we want a little more show.  And a lot of emails came in, people were like, why didn't you guys go late? 
[00:25:30]  Trust me, we couldn't get out of that show fast enough.  I walked out of here.  Because that thing was getting harder and harder and I'm like, Jesus.  I want to jerk off on a stage.  You promised.  You promised.  You promised.  It wasn't good enough that he was doing it over there.  He had to do it on our stage.  Life broke its promise to that guy.  Should we call this the Tippy Tom stage?  No.  No?  Just a thought.  When I walked out of here yesterday, I put my coat on. 
[00:26:00]  I wrapped my little scarf around my neck and I would not touch a thing.  I had to wait for Jimmy to open the door to the studio, which I walked out.  Yeah.  I had my arms behind me.  Master Poe opened the front door.  And I wouldn't even hit the button to the elevator, fearing Tippy Tom had touched it.  The guy was touching his junk and then touching things.  Why would you want to touch that?  Why would you even want to get near that? 
[00:26:30]  I couldn't get far enough away from the situation.  I wish we could describe the studio a little better.  But I was at the furthest point you could possibly be from that situation and still broadcast.  I had pulled the microphone around behind my monitors.  I was in a corner because I hate stuff like that.  I love when the show gets to the point where you have to hide.  It happens from time to time.  I get skeeved out very easily.  It's either a very cringy moment where you're just so uncomfortable.  You will hide behind equipment or something like yesterday. 
[00:27:00]  I have to hide.  You're right.  We have some Tippy Tom audio of him singing.  We do.  Here's Tippy Tom from yesterday.  I don't even know what this is.  What's he singing?  It's three tracks of him singing.  I love you just the way you are.  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  I love you any way you are. 
[00:27:30]  Yes, I do.  Come close to me.  I see song promo.  Be a part of me and I'll love you anyway.  Yes, I will any day.  I will love you.  He's singing about a subway drink.  Yes, I will.  I will love you.  This is from Tippy Tom. 
[00:28:00]  And yes, I'll do.  I'll hold you close.  No, you won't.  And you can kiss me if you want.  The microphone's melting.  And yes, I love your kiss.  And I will kiss you too.  This is great.  That's it.  That's it?  All right. 
[00:28:30]  He just threw the mic down.  There you have it.  Tippy Tom from yesterday.  One of his songs.  Oh, he had many.  Ponderous.  I think we got to get the clip of him whacking off that we got to replay before we step aside  for Thanksgiving break.  Toolbag from New Orleans.  He writes, Opie screaming, you can't jerk off to Tippy Tom is up there with take the  wig.  Take the wig.  Yeah, that was really rank yesterday.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Chicago.  Hey, Kevin.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas? 
[00:29:00]  How are you guys doing today?  We're doing good.  That's good.  I just got a question for you.  You know, you, let me cut this radio down a little bit.  You know, you guys had Tippy Tom on there, and you got some good ratings off for that  because, I mean, that shit was funny as hell.  But my thing for you is, you know, did you guys do anything else for this man besides,  you know, giving him some Jägermeister?  Oh, we gave him Jägermeister, a full bottle of Jägermeister, which he was very excited about, 
[00:29:30]  and $20.  That's like winning the lottery to the homeless guy.  Oh, we also gave him an XM Satellite t-shirt and hat so he could promote our radio show  as he's staggering around Fifth Avenue.  You know what, dude?  Kevin, I learned a long time ago it's not worth the effort to try to help someone like that.  I mean, I just don't have time.  And the guy's happy being what he is.  I'm dead serious. 
[00:30:00]  Because they try to clean.  We saw him clean and sober.  Yep.  Because he was in the hospital for an injury, and, I mean, he didn't stay sober more than  a week after he got out.  He was a normal guy.  Talked all normal.  He was shaved.  His hair was brushed.  And he was completely cleaned up and normal.  And then he has...  Oh, okay.  You know, when he's sober, he has that stereotypical gay voice.  It is really creepy.  He was talking like this.  He talks totally different.  Let me tell you something, honey. 
[00:30:30]  They put me in this hospital and cleaned me up.  That's how he sounds, and I'm not exaggerating.  I swear.  And then when he's drunk, he's all like this.  You said I could jerk off on the stage.  Well, well, well, well, well, you know, put it like this.  Don't you think that he would be a lot better person if he was a little bit more cleaner  than, you know, because when he comes in, he's got shit in his fucking drawers and stuff,  you know, man.  That ain't cool.  You know, could you buy him some drawers or something?  Buy him some drawers.  Buy the brother some drawers.  We really should have bought him some new underwear. 
[00:31:00]  Next time we see him, we'll give him some new underwear if that makes you happy.  Yeah, man.  Do just a little something.  All right.  All right.  All right.  He got those.  You know, he got those.  All right.  All right.  He got those guys going out the roof, man.  All right.  Thank you, Kevin.  Hey, thank you.  You know how many messes are associated with this radio show?  If we try to sober up the messes and help the messes that help us, it would be more  than a full-time job.  We are a reflection of society, Opie.  All we do, we give this half-assed little try at helping people to make ourselves feel 
[00:31:30]  a little good.  That's it.  That's what humanity does.  Right.  They don't really help.  You just do this little thing to kind of feel good about yourself, and then you move on.  If it doesn't work, oh, well, I'm not trying all that hard.  It's like the stupid lady die situation.  She's a falling-down drunk.  She's, ugh.  They're coming in today, the retarded Laverne Shirley.  But, you know, what are we going to do on our off hours, try to get her help or get  her a job?  We're busy men. 
[00:32:00]  We sure are.  Tippi Tom, same thing.  You know, he got cleaned up.  Last time he was on the show, and what did we do, the Christmas thing that we do?  Homeless shopping spree?  Homeless shopping spree.  We do that.  Got him some good stuff.  Felt good.  It's like, yeah, we got good radio out of it.  But look, Opie, we also helped.  You know what we did, though?  We made them targets in their communities.  I was going to say, all the homeless people that went back to their homeless communities  with all their brand-new sneakers and jackets and hats and gloves, what happened to them, 
[00:32:30]  Anthony?  It was like tying meat to somebody and throwing them to the sharks.  That's pretty much it.  They had all this new stuff that they had just bought, new sneakers, new coats.  Remember Ziggy?  Ziggy had brand-new sneakers, this nice down coat.  I'm laughing uncomfortably at this point because he was beaten about the face, and his  sneakers and coat was removed from his possession.  That was it.  That's the reality.  He couldn't fight.  He was a little old. 
[00:33:00]  That's the reality of it.  We really thought we were doing a good thing, and we found out maybe, I don't know, when  we got back from break that it went horribly wrong for these people.  These people, it would be a full-time job to straighten them up, and then again, you  might fail.  But what are you going to do?  Spend all your time?  You're going to have Tippy Tom come to your house so you can watch him and make sure he  eats right and sleeps and doesn't do booze?  Define happy.  That guy is happy.  Not a worry in the world.  Not a worry in the world. 
[00:33:30]  That crap in his underwear.  And he seems like he's a very happy person.  There are people that have their act together, and they're miserable out there.  So that anal aunt probably has, oh, imagine how much that itches.  Oh, the swamp ass?  Just having that swamp ass.  Having that, you know what was really disgusting?  He had crap in his ass.  And because of the human anatomy, it had flattened out like a wafer.  It was just kind of in there like a little wafer.  Yeah.  It was awful.  Here's more of Tippy Tom singing from yesterday. 
[00:34:00]  This is a shorter track.  We're going to get busy.  It's going to get right.  Now, I'm going to say Tippy Tom is going to belt one out.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Tippy Tom is going to belt a song out.  I should back up.  Come on.  I want to say a song.  Come on, Rummy.  I want to belt one out.  I'm going to sing a good song. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Oh, you're going to get along.  We know you're going to sing.  We're going to sing.  We're going to sing.  All right.  Oh, you belt one out.  All right.  Tippy Tom will belt one out.  All right.  Oh, that was it.  He spent the whole time saying how he's going to belt one out, but never belt one out.  I'm going to belt out a song. 
[00:35:00]  Shut up.  Then sing.  We have one more before we move on from the Tippy Tom thing, okay?  We do have to play the audio of him whacking it.  Make sure that Steve gets that, okay?  The sooner the better, actually, because we played it late in the show yesterday.  Softly, I will leave you softly long before your arms can make me wait for one more hour. 
[00:35:30]  Come on.  Who did that?  Or one more day.  Is he complaining that someone farted?  After all the years.  He's perfect for Frank's voice.  Come on, guys.  You're fucking me up, man.  That song was awful.  You ain't know who fucking sang it.  Yeah.  What song is that?  You don't even know.  I know.  It was that guy who does those songs.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No, right?  I'm right, though, right?  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  I can't bear the tears so softly as I leave you there.  As I leave you there.  Charles Manson?  Who sang this?  Who sang that?  Can you do some Frank Sinatra?  Yeah!  Oh.  All right.  About time.  It is about time.  You need another shot before you do Frank Sinatra?  You're fucking right.  It's about time.  It's about fucking right.  Get the hell out of here.  Where's he going?  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  Yeah, go.  Get out of here. 
[00:36:30]  You're fucking right.  That's right.  Go.  We were dealing with a freaking animal yesterday.  A little, just a tad bit unstable.  And the video is up on foundrymusic.com.  Oh, it is?  It's being downloaded like crazy.  People commenting?  Opian Anthony.com.  We'll get you to the Tippy Tom videos from yesterday.  I think we got all the videos up there.  I mean, his ass crack, his junk, his singing.  I think they even taped him when we thought he was dead. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We should get Martini Steven here.  I want to know what clips he's got up there.  Because I finally ordered my new computer because I haven't been able to check out video clips in a long time on my old piece of crap.  Oh, got you something new last night.  I appreciate it, Anthony.  Anthony buys my computers for me.  Ordered up something nice.  I'm just waiting for Martini Steve to enter the studio.  It's so funny to order a computer for Opie, though, because it's such a, you know, such a cute computer.  It's just, you know, it doesn't. 
[00:37:30]  What do you need?  Eh, not that much.  A video card?  Eh, whatever.  Me, I need, like, $800 video cards and huge monitors.  Opie's just, eh, whatever.  I'm just cruising the web.  Eh, that's it.  There you go.  Hey, Steve.  Hey, Opie.  We want to know what videos you got of Tippy Tom.  Got up to the point where he...  Wow, who are these hot girls? 
[00:38:00]  Ziggy's, friends of Ziggy's.  Are they getting naked?  We're finding out now.  They just showed up.  Who's Ziggy?  Who's Ziggy?  Ziggy's the guy that runs the XM fan message board.  Oh, okay.  Oh, Ziggy Ziggy.  We all know Ziggy Ziggy.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  So, the videos.  Got as far as the close-up of Tom's crap-stained underwear.  Oh.  Then I got skeeved and had to stop.  All right.  We have about four or five clips up now.  There's going to be more throughout the next four days.  Are you going to get the clip of him when we thought he was dead? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  You were filming that, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I've got the video of Poe and Keith trying to wake up Tippy Tom.  Make sure you throw that up there because I want people to see what we saw.  We thought this guy was dead.  I'm not even lying.  That's up right now.  And then you'll have the clip of him whacking it and showing his golden buns to everybody?  Yeah.  Golden buns.  Golden buns.  When he's calling himself golden buns.  Your website is going to explode over the next four or five days.  The only way you get the nickname golden buns is if you've had a mile of cock in your ass. 
[00:39:00]  Girls.  Yeah.  Hi, girlies.  All right.  So, opandanthony.com, you'll get the video clips in the coming days.  But there's a few up there right now.  Yeah.  Thank you, Martini Steve.  Thank you.  You want to take a break or you want to continue?  We're just kind of hanging.  Oh, you nailed him.  Steve.  You know what?  We'll step aside.  We'll regroup.  All righty.  We're in every newspaper in America again today.  And it's for a good thing because we can finally move on officially with our radio careers, 
[00:39:30]  I think.  Tony, yesterday, we were saying how sick we are of the Sex for Sam thing.  Right.  And how we want to change the beginning of the show.  It's like, all right, enough of referencing it.  It's over.  It's old news.  Right.  And then the very next day, Opie, it's all over the news again.  But it has finally ended, I believe.  Yeah.  It ends today.  So we'll get into that next and some other things.  Do you guys got Tourette's over there?  All right.  We're going to play Tourette's Whorehouse for that trucker and anyone else who hasn't heard 
[00:40:00]  it from our Dementor World CD.  Check this out.  We'll be back.  Good afternoon.  Hi.  I'm going to be in the Nevada area in about a week.  Uh-huh.  I got your pleasure menu.  Could you hold on a minute?  Mm-hmm.  I'm sorry.  I have Tourette's syndrome, which makes it hard to communicate. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, no problem.  Okay.  You need prices, hon?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, house minimum starts at $100.  That's for a basic one activity party.  $100.  Wow, that's pretty cheap.  That's where the prices start.  And then from there, the sky's the limit because all the ladies are independent contractors.  You don't think the girls would mind being with a guy with a...  That's no problem, hon. 
[00:41:00]  Handicap's no problem.  Oh, good.  Good.  So I could come down and, you know, get a girl and climb aboard and start going...  Well, you have to come in and discuss that with the lady.  Okay.  So for $100, could I put my head between her...  Could I do that?  Yeah, I'm not allowed to discuss that on the phone.  You have to discuss that with the lady, okay? 
[00:41:30]  Oh.  I just want to warn you that when I get in the room and things get hot and heavy, I could get a little wild, you know, when I get...  Is that okay?  That's no problem, hon.  Do you take...  MasterCard?  Yes, we do.  Could I bring a muzzle so I don't clamp down on anything I shouldn't?  That's fine.  Do you think a girl would mind if...  When I start... 
[00:42:00]  She spanks me.  You have to come in and discuss with the lady.  Are they pretty women?  Very pretty.  This might sound...  It's worth your time, okay?  This might sound like a strange request, but...  Do you have any...  Girls that aren't that attractive, babe?  All of our ladies are very nice.  I have...  Jungle fever?  Do you have any...  Black girls?  We have black ladies.  We have Asian ladies. 
[00:42:30]  We have Oriental ladies.  It just depends.  I have to go now because I'm very busy, okay?  Do you have any...  Do you have a dwarf?  No, we don't.  Not at this time.  Because I saw a dwarf in a movie once and it made me...  Goodbye, okay?  But wait...  Cash up, niggas.  All my niggas in the P now, right now.

We love WOW.  We absolutely love WOW. 
[00:48:00]  If you want a WOW sticker, go to opieandanthony.com.  There's a place there.  You leave your address and we send out a WOW sticker eventually.  I like how you did the fake keyboard.  You saw that, right?  When you said you leave your address.  And Timmy Tom yesterday was doing this.  Whacking.  Whacking.  And basically, WOW for the new listeners.  It's really simple.  Ladies, you see the WOW on the back of someone's car or on the back of the truck.  Sometimes it's written in dirt.  Sometimes it's a homemade WOW sign.  Or the official OV Anthony WOW sticker. 
[00:48:30]  That means that guy would love to see your boobies.  Not only guys, there are women out there that want to see other women's boobies.  They sure do.  It works like a charm.  Oh, wow.  And that's that, okay?  I think we're doing a WOW sticker stop today.  Our listeners take it upon themselves to spread the virus any way they can.  And today, there's going to be a fan just kind of hanging out in a parking lot.  The Best Buy parking lot in Northeast Philadelphia.  That's 9940 Roosevelt Boulevard, Anthony. 
[00:49:00]  Spreading the O&A virus.  Go get your ass some stickers.  Who's doing this sticker stop?  I know it's a listener.  I want to give him some credit here.  Whatever.  It's Best Buy parking lot, Northeast Philly, 9940 Roosevelt Boulevard.  He's there right now.  These listeners that take it upon themselves to do these sticker stops, do they plan the  whole thing?  Yeah, there's a whole thing.  They plan it.  They get the location.  Yeah, Steve makes up a sweeper and runs in the brakes. 
[00:49:30]  Grop on Foundry.  This is the brilliant marketing that is being done for our radio show.  Great.  Not the marketing that they told us they were going to do when we decided to sign with  XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah, we've got listeners.  You know, the national TV spot and the truck that was going to have Opie and Anthony on  the side that was just going to crisscross across America.  And the billboards.  Remember all that stuff we talked about?  I certainly do.  It's listeners grabbing a pile of stickers and hanging out in a parking lot somewhere, 
[00:50:00]  hoping that somehow they connect with XM listeners.  That's it.  That's what we've got going on.  Thank you.  But that's what they do when they're kissing your ass in the beginning.  No matter what you do for a living.  Yeah.  Whether you're in radio or what have you.  When you're being wooed.  When you're being wooed, they promise you the moon.  When you're being courted.  And then as soon as you sign that contract, remember Lawyer Lady?  Yeah.  As soon as we signed the contract, there was no champagne or celebration.  She grabbed the contracts and ran out. 
[00:50:30]  Couldn't believe we signed them.  Ran out.  And ran out and said, well, your train is going to be here in 15 minutes.  We'll have Megan drive you back to the train station.  That's it.  That's how we signed with XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  And then we were ushered out to the train station.  And then the kissing of the asses ended officially that day.  All of a sudden we were back in New York looking at each other going, did we just, what?  Did we, what?  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  What are we filming the big national TV spot they promised us?  Yeah.  I thought that phone call was coming next. 
[00:51:00]  It never came.  Not yet.  Not yet.  I'm hearing big things for 2005.  Oh, yeah.  So am I.  Big things.  So am I.  Please.  We'll see.  We got to go to Heather.  Heather in Connecticut.  What's up?  Hi.  Heather.  Heather, what do you want to do today?  Play what's in my pants.  Oh.  Oh, look at you.  Are you on a cell phone?  Yes, I am.  Where are you?  Connecticut.  Are you in a car already?  I understand.  I mean.  No, I'm actually in my boyfriend's truck at the truck stop. 
[00:51:30]  At a truck stop?  Uh-huh.  On I-95?  Yeah.  Which one?  Pilot.  And what kind of car are you driving?  Green Cavalier.  And where is it parked?  Somewhere.  Oh, damn.  Just trying to help the fellow listeners out.  Give it a peek in.  Right.  All right.  So you're on the way to work, I'm assuming, and you wanted to play, I guess, what's in  my pants?  Yeah.  And you're 24 years old?  Yep.  Give us some more visuals.  What do you look like? 
[00:52:00]  5'7".  5'7".  Nice.  38D chest.  38D?  Uh-huh.  All right.  A little...  Okay.  All right.  No, I know what that means.  Yeah.  And how much do you weigh?  About 160.  150?  160.  60.  160.  Uh-huh.  5'7".  5'7", 160, 38.  D.  D.  Right.  No, I understand what the D's all about.  The 30...  Big, big.  What? 
[00:52:30]  Big, big chest.  No, we understand what the D means, but I also understand what the 38 means.  Wait.  38 means a little wide around the back, right?  A little bit.  A little bit.  Maybe.  A little.  Not too bad, but starting to get a little bit.  A little bit.  It means you're clipping your bra in the front and spinning it around the back, right?  No, actually, I don't wear those kind of bras.  Oh.  Only a select few girls could actually reach around and fasten it right from the back. 
[00:53:00]  All right.  The chubby girls tend to buckle it up front.  I'm actually not chubby.  Spin it around.  I'm all muscle.  You're all muscle?  Oh, that's what a lot of girls like to say.  I'm not chubby.  It's all muscle.  You sure you're not going to be late for work?  What time do you start working?  I already am.  Oh, that sucks.  That means we're not going to be able to play.  Why not?  Well, I think we should play.  Yeah?  Hold on two seconds.  Could you hit that button right there? 
[00:53:30]  Which one?  This one?  Yeah.  All right.  She can't hear it?  Shut the fuck up.  She can't hear it right now.  You're going to ruin it.  After tippy-tom, anything with a vag is good.  She's a little chubby, though.  She's not 160, either, by the way.  And she's lying.  She's probably about 174.  174?  5'7", 160 is way off my chart.  Look, way off the acceptable chart.  No one's got any delusions that she ain't fat.  Wait, they might be listening to us.  Oh, shit.  Heather.  Hey, turn your radio off.  Heather.  Yeah?  You've got to turn your radio off.  There's a big feedback happening.  Okay.  Yeah, turn it off for a minute, right? 
[00:54:00]  Quick.  Honey, shut it off.  Yeah.  Yeah, you better shut it off now before...  Because it's feeding back.  It could ruin some of our equipment.  Right.  Shut the...  Yeah.  Are you shutting off the radio?  I'm asking you to, yeah.  Okay.  All right, good.  All right.  All right.  So do you want to play with her or not?  I think we should play with her.  Yeah, we should.  We should.  Huh?  Huh?  Oh, let off a minute.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, because we're just...  We think we want to play.  Why not?  Yeah, we want to play.  We appreciate you pulling over.  Just hold for two seconds more.  What kind of panties are you wearing? 
[00:54:30]  Um, phones.  Nice.  On most ladies, it's nice.  But she's a little fat.  I have seven, 160.  I know what's in her pants.  Fucking chocolate stains all over her box with her fat fingers dipping in there.  So are we going to play or not?  She can't hear us, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  We got to get...  We got to act really excited like this is the hottest thing ever.  Okay, guys?  Are you with me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Heather?  Mm-hmm.  Let's play.  We would love to play Guess What's in Your Pants. 
[00:55:00]  Nice.  All righty.  All right.  Let's commit by playing the theme music.  Oh, well...  Yeah, as you...  Well, what are you wearing right now?  The thong?  Just my brown panties.  Just your panties?  And are you topless?  No, I got my brown.  Do you want me to take it off?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You better take it off because you want to be able to breathe nicely as you play Guess  What's in My Pants.  Very nice.  Yes.  All right.  It's off.  Are they falling...  Oh, wait.  They're...  Oh, yeah.  Are they falling to the side? 
[00:55:30]  No.  Oh, nice.  Very nice.  Could you hold on one second?  What, Jimmy?  Jesus Christ.  I bet they're sweaty underneath and they smell like lamb.  All right, Heather.  You still with us?  Uh, yeah.  Okay.  Seems to be a problem with your phone.  We crap out a little bit here.  No, I can hear it fine.  Oh, all right.  There we go.  All right, we're going to play the theme song and you get ready with that cell phone, okay?  All right.  All right. 
[00:56:00]  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, Guess What's in My Pants.  It's the receiver.  Heather, upon your beaver, it's time to play Hey, Guess What's in My Pants.  It's time to guess what's in my pants.  My pants.  All right.  We have Heather on the phone from Connecticut.  She's going to play Guess What's in My Pants.  You know how to play, Anthony?  You know how to play, Heather? 
[00:56:30]  I rub the phone on my cock.  No.  No?  Anthony will give you the official rules of Guess What's in My Pants.  Ready?  Yeah.  We will ask you to rub the phone in various directions on your...  And you'll do it.  You know, up and down, side to side, circular.  And we will decide or actually guess what type of hairstyle you have based on the sound  coming out of the phone.  Please do not at any time give us any clues or hints or let us know what is in your pants 
[00:57:00]  until we ask you what is in your pants.  Okay.  Before we start, she can't hear me?  Yeah.  I just want the listeners to listen for the bunt.  You're going to hear the bunt?  You're going to hear the bunt when she's going up and down.  Up and down.  You hear that little...  Yeah.  All right, Heather.  You ready to go up and down?  Yep.  All right.  Go ahead. 
[00:57:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah.  You're going to need to do that a little more.  Could you do it again?  And you need to...  You need to...  I don't know.  I couldn't hear it very well.  Well, why?  Because it's going around the moon.  We kind of lose contact, isn't it?  Heather?  Around the moon.  Yeah.  The phone hits LOS.  Loss of signal.  Hey, Michael Collins, could you just...  All right.  We're going to need to hear up and down again.  Okay.  You're really going to have to get in there and take care of business, though, all right? 
[00:58:00]  All right.  All right.  Fat arms.  Very interesting.  There's definitely something growing because things grow better in the shade.  Ah, Heather.  Yeah?  Side to side.  Okay.  Okay.  Ah, very telling.  Very telling. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Very hard to hear, but kind of strange.  Hold on one second, Heather.  What is your problem, Jim?  Why the faces?  This is just awful.  Isn't it?  I can just picture the little fat legs up in the air, little fat hand trying to reach,  and the phone just going...  Because her arm can't quite reach properly.  It doesn't have much room to move between the fat thighs.  Yeah.  Left, right, left, right, left, right.  Side to side.  It's like there's no room in there.  She's got a leg spread apart, and her thighs are still touching.  Yeah, and the phone is trying to pull its, like, neck back.  All right.  Back to Heather.  All right, Heather.  Let's do the circular motion now. 
[00:59:00]  Okay.  Okay.  Hmm.  Could I hear up and down again, Heather?  Oh.  Glutton for punishment.  All right.  Okay.  That's a tough one.  I got it.  I got it.  I don't have much doubt.  All right.  Anthony, to you. 
[00:59:30]  Okay.  Remember, Heather, don't tell us until we ask you.  Okay.  I'm going to go with the mohawk.  The mohawk?  I believe I heard some variation on the side to side.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, I'm going to go with the, uh, uh, the triangle.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Wait, the variation was either a mohawk hair or, um, pancake syrup.  Well, I want to hear the, uh, can I hear, can I hear up and down one more time?  I'm sorry.  One more time.  Okay.  Okay. 
[01:00:00]  Damn it.  I got to go with the mohawk, too.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  So we got two mohawks.  My first thing was stupid, uh, wood floor, too, and I know I should go with that one.  Yeah.  It might be a wood floor that wasn't shaved this morning.  That's what I'm kind of hearing, like a triangle action.  So, Heather?  Uh-huh?  What is in your pants?  I'm actually bald, and I have a small patch above.  Hitler mustache.  Why would, why did I say that? 
[01:00:30]  Hitler mustache.  Wow, you're finally wrong, Jimmy.  I've been wrong twice.  My second one.  Oh, okay.  There you have it.  Mm-hmm.  She's got the Hitler mustache.  Yes, I do.  Actually, it looks more like an Oliver Hardy on her.  Aw.  Well, I'm just talking about it.  That's really not nice.  What is that?  Because Oliver Hardy's mustache was a little smaller than Hitler's.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  That wasn't nice.  All right.  Heather, thanks for playing Guess What's in My Pants.  Bye.  Have fun and work, okay?  Oh, yeah.  Bye. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  There she goes, Heather, from Connecticut.  There you go.  Call back.  We'll play What's in My Fridge.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Place Marie Steeler upon your beaver.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to guess what's in my pants.  My pants.  She sounded like a lovely lady, Anthony. 
[01:01:30]  Of course.  5-7-1-60.  I guess it's not that bad, right?  Not if you live on Jupiter.  5-7 isn't like she's 5-2.  I'm 160.  And 160.  I'm 160 and 5-11, so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just squish me down a little bit.  Squish you down a little?  Yeah.  But then you got to take some meat off of somewhere that you squished and put it up on your boobs.  Right.  Because she's got big boobs.  Right.  So, I don't know.  You do know.  Awful. 
[01:02:00]  All right.  I'm picturing like Amazon woman.  Yeah.  Kind of big.  Big boned.  She sounds a lot like my first true love, Buzz.  In California.  That was about the size of Buzz?  She was kind of big.  Had big boobs.  And she was big.  You know, tall and kind of meaty.  Not fat, but big girl.  Like an Amazon.  You know, big girls are okay if they're still young.  The problem is big girls get older and then it gets kind of messy and sloppy. 
[01:02:30]  You can put that in front of anything.  Retarded girls are okay as long as they're young.  You know, it pretty much fits for anything.  One-legged girls, fine, as long as they're young.  This guy's really pissed off at us.  Why?  What did we do?  Damn Yankee.  What's going on?  Hey, man, you guys need to quit ragging on the fat girls.  Quit ragging on the fat girls?  Yeah, the only reason you guys rag on the fat girls is because your mule's too small to get through the fat to get to the pussy. 
[01:03:00]  Dude, I'm proud of my mule, and I can tell you right now, it's not small.  Well, what are you ragging on the fat girls for?  Some guys like them little fat girls.  I just said I don't mind a fat girl, you know?  As long as they're young.  You like the chubbies there, a damn Yankee?  Hell yeah, I like the little chubby girls.  Look, there's nothing wrong once in a while, you're going to have a few drinks and go hogging.  No one is saying that that's wrong, it's just not my thing.  It's not my bag.  Yeah, it's not awful, but...  I'm sure she's just fine. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, I wouldn't consider her a hog, she's just a little chubby.  All right.  That's all I have to say, I'm punching out.  All right, mister.  Thank you.  This guy wants to yell at Norton.  Frank from Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey.  I'm spending like $12 a month, and I just don't want to hear Norton.  This guy takes the funny out of everything he talks about.  What?  Oh, no, it's this guy.  It's this guy again.  Go ahead, sir.  I remember your first call.  It was not bad.  Go ahead.  It's not the same guy, Jack.  It is the same guy.  I recognize the term. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, you're an asshole.  You don't know shit.  You know what your problem is?  What, sir?  You just sound like you're eating food all the time.  You interrupt Opie and Anthony constantly with your stupid fucking joke.  You're talking about gay shit all the time.  You know what?  I'll take a fat chick any day over listening to you talk about your dribble.  You dribble?  You're a pathetic little jello tart.  You suck.  I talk dribble, do I?  You suck.  Yeah?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Three, two, four.  That's it.  You suck, man.  You ruined the show.  Uh-huh.  Mm-hmm.  You know how happy that makes me that you're spending this money on the O&A show and I'm 
[01:04:30]  spoiling it for you?  Jesus.  Okay, you know, that makes you more of a dickhead.  You suck, dude.  Dude, that's all you have to say?  That's all I need to say.  You suck.  That's not very sincere, sir.  You're hoping I'll yell at you and it's not going to happen.  I don't want to yell at you.  He wanted to be the guy that gets yelled at by Jimmy.  I know.  I didn't want to talk to you because you know what?  I'll be there.  Complete failure.  Not you.  Don't.  What's that, sir?  I just repeat that.  I didn't hear you.  He's gone. 
[01:05:00]  You didn't hang up on him, did you?  No, I didn't.  I think his connection went.  He wanted to be the guy that Jimmy yells at so he could be like, oh, I was the guy today.  Yeah, I called up and I mocked Jimmy.  And then Jim yelled at me.  But he wasn't the guy that Jimmy yelled at.  No.  It's like, stop trying to evoke a reaction, stupid.  All right.  We got some great O.J. audio, too.  O.J.  We'll talk about that in a minute.  But we're in a lot of newspapers today and we're on a lot of newscasts, Anthony.  Oh, they drag out the old footage. 
[01:05:30]  And apparently it's over, Johnny.  Should I just read this?  Our old company...  Wow, I can't talk today.  It's over, Johnny.  I can't talk more than usual today.  It's not fine.  Uh, our old company, Viacom, Anthony.  To pay indecency fine.  The price of coming clean, $3.5 million.  3.5 mil.  That's how much Viacom agreed to pay yesterday to end investigations by the FCC into charges 
[01:06:00]  that its shock jock radio and television programming was indecent.  Shock jock.  The fine, one of the largest in FCC history, settles three pending investigations, one  involving Howard Stern and two involving your pals, Opie and Anthony.  Isn't that great?  Who lost their Viacom-owned New York radio show after it featured a couple, uh, reportedly  having sex inside St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan.  Oh, shit.  Viacom agreed to install audio delay equipment at its radio stations that broadcast live programming 
[01:06:30]  and to train its broadcasters and employees about indecency laws.  Wow, that's going to be a fun thing to have to do if you work for Viacom.  Go to that training.  Do the, the indecency training.  Who's going to teach that?  We went through the indecency training all the time with the lawyers, and that's why  I will say again today our show was not indecent on that day.  No.  We know for a fact it wasn't indecent.  This is a payoff.  They just needed this to go away because I'm sure they got business, uh, that's coming.  Yeah, they want to buy stations.  And they don't want anything in the way to, to, to wreck that, so. 
[01:07:00]  I have a question about one of those fines.  Wasn't one of the problems on Stern's show?  Didn't, didn't a caller say nigger and, like, that was one of the things that they cited?  No, I think it's about, uh, some guy, uh, talking about the Paris Hilton sex video and  having anal with Paris Hilton.  Why do they say a racial epithet?  Why is that said in the paper?  Like, that was part of it.  I know, because that's not finable.  That's not, right?  No.  Okay.  Dopes that, dopes that write into the FCC and complain?  You fucking dopes.  They're the ones that think.  They write in and complain and want, uh, action taken and they have no clue of the law or what 
[01:07:30]  is actionable and what isn't.  And they actually believe that offensive speech is indecent.  That if you're offended, that you can complain to the FCC and they must do something about it.  Eh!  Wrong, idiot!  You could say nigger, spick, kike, wop, whatever you want to say, chink, gook, charlie.  If it offends you, fine.  Can you do anything about it?  No. 
[01:08:00]  You can complain to the station.  You can, uh, boycott advertisers.  You can take it upon yourself to go on a mission.  But writing the FCC and, and hoping they do something about it?  BAMP!  It's called freedom of speech.  And that isn't covered by the FCC.  They're not allowed to fine for race.  You can't, you can say whatever you want as far as race goes.  You can say whatever you want as far as your politics goes.  You're allowed.  That's what the country's about.  And that's the freedom of speech thing. 
[01:08:30]  They have the indecency thing tied up because, uh, at some point they decided they need to  protect the children and they made, uh, certain rules and regulations about indecency that  they can't even define.  But, uh, those things you can complain about, unfortunately.  But you can.  But if you're offended because you hear the word nigger, you can't.  I don't know why I thought that.  I read, I read that was part of it somewhere and I'm like, I hope that's not like a, all  of a sudden something they're policing.  No, they just throw that in the paper to get your attention.  Uh-huh.  That's pretty much it. 
[01:09:00]  But, uh, you know how many people think that they can complain and that the FCC is supposed  to do something about that kind of language?  I'm with you.  It's offensive.  Yes.  I agree wholeheartedly.  But it's not actionable on the part of the FCC.  It's not in their little, uh, rule book.  All right.  But, uh, it goes on to say that, uh, even though that Viacom, uh, spent $3.5 million  to clear all business with the FCC.  Yeah.  All business except for the Janet Jackson incident that they're still fighting.  Oh.  The Super Bowl incident. 
[01:09:30]  Yes, of course.  And then the, uh, this article, I mean, we're in every newspaper.  Uh, this one says, until their broadcast from St. Patrick's Cathedral in 2002, Greg Opie-Hughes  Greg Opie-Hughes, there he is, and Anthony Cumia were syndicated in 17 markets outside  New York City.  The pair had been off the air until they joined with XM Satellite Radio in October.  By leaving traditional airwaves, the shock jocks avoid any oversight by the FCC.  Thank God we don't have to deal with the FCC anymore.  Because they're out of their minds.  They don't even know what the rules are at this point. 
[01:10:00]  No, as far as indecency goes, they have no clue.  So, you, you, you talk about, uh, you talk about the same subject matter on two different  shows, and, uh, one will get fined, one won't.  If you, you're doing a medical show, and you're talking about a woman's vagina, and talking about  medical problems, and there's a doctor that's, uh, on board, and, uh, for some reason that's,  that's okay.  Well, Love Lines is a perfect example.  Yeah.  Even though it's in the quote, safe harbor. 
[01:10:30]  Safe harbor.  That BS.  Yeah.  Safe harbor, that's when most kids are listening to the radio.  Yeah.  You know, kids that call into that show, all, like, 15, 14 years old.  I know.  Most, most kids are supervised during morning radio shows.  Right now, there are parents out there watching their kids more now than they will the rest  of the day.  And they have places to go.  But this is the time period that the FCC has a problem with.  Mm-hmm.  It's at night when they're up in their rooms and stuff, they're listening to all the crazy  sex talk.  Right. 
[01:11:00]  You know, logically, the FCC just doesn't make sense.  No.  With anything.  Well, that's their excuse.  They'd rather it not be anywhere, anytime.  That's where we've gotten.  They're so upset about these things.  That whole thing that happened during Monday Night Football, where stupid Michael Powell  came out and said that that was awful, that they showed the woman from Desperate Housewives  dropping her towel.  And all you saw was her back.  You saw her bare back. 
[01:11:30]  What's awful about that?  From the waist up.  We're not even talking an ass shot here.  How is that indecent?  How is that indecent?  How is that indecent?  I don't know.  I don't know either.  But for some reason, they were saying that that was inappropriate and should not have  been played during Monday Night Football.  Everyone's got to just calm the F down.  You know why?  Because the family is watching.  That's family time.  Ugh.  What difference does it make what time it is?  Who's watching?  Right.  It's a woman's bare back. 
[01:12:00]  Right.  How awful is that?  What's it going to do to the children?  Whenever they don't have a valid argument, they yank out kids.  Right.  Like Martin Sheen in the dead zone.  They just grab it and hold it up and hide behind it because there's no valid argument.  So it's like the race card of other arguments.  Right, right.  Just yank out the fucking kids and what if they see it?  It's sickening.  And what if they see it?  If I defy you, show me one instance where some child has been damaged by adult-oriented  conversation.  Yep. 
[01:12:30]  Now, I'm not talking pornography here.  You know, I'm not talking this show that's on satellite radio that a kid might be listening  to.  And I still don't think it'll affect them.  But as a parent, you wouldn't want them listening to this kind of programming.  But stuff that goes over regular airwaves, that type of adult-oriented conversation that's  a lot of code words, a lot of innuendo, stuff like that.  You've got to be, you know, you've got to kind of weave in and out of the subject matter.  What's that doing to a kid? 
[01:13:00]  Nothing.  Nothing.  Believe me, his home life is screwing him up a lot more than radio shows.  Stupid radio show.  Well, we're part of all the newscasts this morning, Anthony.  Yes.  And as they come in, we'll play them.  Here's local Fox News here in New York.  Uh-huh.  Listen to these dopes.  Opie and Anthony have cost their bosses a lot of money.  Viacom and the FCC have reached a multi-million dollar agreement to settle dozens of indecency  investigations.  Viacom will pay a record $3.5 million in fines. 
[01:13:30]  The FCC will close investigations into Howard Stern's radio show and the Opie and Anthony  show.  They've been off the air since they pulled a sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral back  in 2002.  Viacom also agreed to use audio delays for live shows.  They think we're off the air.  Yeah, great.  They're a news outlet and they think we're still off the air.  They think we're not broadcasting yet.  Well, didn't they see the billboard on...  A news outlet still thinks we're off the air. 
[01:14:00]  I don't even blame the news outlet for that.  That's why I start this show saying you're witnessing the biggest attempt in radio history.  Comeback attempt in radio history.  Because even the news outlets don't even know we're back broadcasting.  And we've been on Fox.  What happened?  We were on the...  Hannity and Combs.  Yeah.  Well, that's the national.  That's fine.  Yeah, but it's still, you know...  Is it kind of connected?  Do a little research.  All right. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, this is...  They're still showing videotapes of the fight from the basketball game.  Yeah.  Look at this thug.  They're showing a picture of a guy that they got on video.  The guy that threw the chair.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So the chair went flying.  And now that he's on every TV show, they're showing this mugshot of him turning around looking.  Looks like the film of when that guy fell off the horse taping Bigfoot.  The guy just kind of turns around, looks right into the camera, and they freeze frame it.  Shuffles away into the woods. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to step and ruin the show.  Oh, Jimmy.  There's a ton of people that want to defend you.  I don't know.  And I know you don't want us to go there.  Thank you.  Don't worry about it.  It's fine, dude.  All right.  People love you or hate you.  That's how it goes with little Jimmy Norton.  Anthony, as we go to break, we got the tippy-tom thing.  I want to play it earlier because it happened real late in the show yesterday.  Which clip is it?  This is the grand finale.  Him wanting to jerk off on our stage here.  And me screaming at him that he's not going to do it. 
[01:15:30]  And it just gets ugly.  So as we go to break, check this out from yesterday.  Our homeless guy, tippy-tom.  I'm not sure if he's naked at this point.  I'm not sure if this is when he's showing his golden buns before he decides he needs to whack off.  It just got awful.  Listen to this.  There's the regular machine.  The regular machine's going right now.  All right.  Go ahead, Tom.  If you have to, you might as well.  You've got to scrap it.  Go ahead.  No one's looking.  Are you too insane?  Let him scrap.  He's been doing everything you say.  Just don't.  Someone wants us to describe the girls. 
[01:16:00]  We've got a very hot blonde with very big boobs.  Very natural.  And a very hot brunette.  A little more petite.  Steve C is taking some videos.  Of course.  Yeah, you can catch it all online.  Uh, tippy-tom.  I'm tippy-tom going to jerk off.  All right.  All right.  You might as well.  Yeah, you're all talking no action.  You're all talking no action, pal.  That's right.  I want approval.  Oh, you got it.  We gave you the approval.  We gave you the approval.  You say I got the balls to jerk off?  Yes, you didn't have the balls to do it.  There's no way we're going to have a homeless guy jerking off in front of two real hot lesbians. 
[01:16:30]  That's what we really want.  I can jerk off.  You can't jerk off.  I bet you can't.  I dare you to jerk off.  Tom, you have no balls.  You have no balls.  Give me Tom to jerk off.  No, I bet you won't.  I got $20 says you don't.  I can jerk off.  He has balls.  I got $20 says you don't.  You bet me $20.  I'll bet you $20.  Here, I'll even give it to Keith.  You won't jerk off for $20.  Well, give me a few minutes. 
[01:17:00]  Ah, see?  I'll talk no action.  You only got five minutes left.  Five.  We got two minutes left in the show.  Yeah, because he needs pumpkin pie.  Give it to Tom.  Yeah, Tom.  Tom, you ain't jerking off.  I'm jerking off.  You're not jerking off.  Tom has plenty of pumpkin pie in the back of his underwear.  Eric, show him your ass so he can get it up.  You know damn well, Timmy Tom can jerk off.  Oh, yeah?  I don't think you can.  I got $20 says you don't. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, why don't you give it a shot?  You lying motherfucker.  Oh, yeah, here.  You know damn well I can jerk off.  See, you're not jerking off.  All right.  That thing might go off.  You want me to jerk off?  I want you to jerk off.  As you get ready to do that, I'm going to play a little bit of Point Blank here.  20 bucks and a bottle of Jager, Michael.  Pull that dog out.  This is You Don't Stand a Chance.  Pointblank.tv.  I am horrified.  Point Blank.tv.  I'm sorry.  I want you to get a hot on first.  So you're not going to jerk off?  Stand for him so he can.  If these girls over her legs and they keep going running around me, I'll be jerking off like a bunny. 
[01:18:00]  You're out of your mind.  All right.  This is your last chance, Tibby Tom, or you don't get the 20 bucks.  Let's go.  Two minutes left in the show.  Give the plug for Point Blank. 
[01:18:30]  Pointblank.tv.  They're going to be at Looney Tunes, 31 Brookvale Avenue in West Babylon tomorrow at 7 p.m.  Tibby Tom's going to jerk off.  All right.  Here goes Tibby Tom.  He's going to whack off for $20.  Jimmy's getting his dance, too.  No, no, no.  Just do it on the...  No, no, no.  No, just...  No, no.  Tibby Tom, we only have a minute left in the show.  You got to do it.  Come on.  Let's go.  Pull it out.  20 bucks right now.  All right.  His pace is down. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, my God.  He's whacking off.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I thought I could jerk off here.  No.  Just...  Oh, my God.  You said I could jerk off here.  You're jerking off.  Holy crap.  I said I jerk off over here.  And Jimmy Norton did a lap dance in the corner.  Stop it.  You said I could jerk off here.  You are jerking off.  Relax.  Jesus lying fucking shit.  You said I could jerk off over here. 
[01:19:30]  Get him out of here.  What the fuck, man?  You ain't getting no jerk off of things.  You just had to do it right on the table.  How much time left in this awful show?  Fuck, man.  All right.  Oh, God.  No, stop.  Fuck, man.  Stop.  And Jimmy's getting a lap dance in the corner.  I thought I could jerk off on stage.  I want to thank Point Blank for coming in today.  Thank you, guys.  In the background, it's You Don't Stand a Chance from their CD, Cast the First Stone.  Here we come, man.  You ladies were awesome. 
[01:20:00]  See you guys at the downtown tomorrow.  Yeah.  Anthony and I will be at the downtown tomorrow in Farmingdale.  I didn't jerk off.  You jerked off.  You could have my $20.  You did.  Trust me.  We didn't want to see much more than that anyway.  All right.  Get off our lesbian couch, though, please.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  You know something?  Yeah.  He just had his hands on himself, and now if he touches anything, I need this whole place  disinfected now.  You said I could jerk off on the fucking stage, and I can't.  Now I'm pissed off a year. 
[01:20:30]  You're pissed off.  Take my $20 and the Jägermeister.  We are out of here.  What a effing mess.  It was with them that Wednesday, so I flashed some guy on the Long Island Expressway.

[01:23:00]  In 1976, Greg Norman won his first event and only his third start as a pro.  I knew that in my shy, introverted way in those days that, you know, there was kind of like  a platform for me to enjoy it.  And so when I went out on Sunday, I didn't want to lose it.  Even 10th shot now.  How do I play with a 10th shot lead?  I have no experience.  Do you try and run through the finishing line and make it 18?  Or do you try and hold on and play conservative? 
[01:23:30]  So I really didn't know what to do.  And I probably played like it in the end because I think I only won by five, if my memory's  right.  But, you know, as I look back on it, a victory is a victory.  And that was a catalyst.  I think I won about $7,000 or $8,000.  It might have been $7,000 then, Australian dollars.  And I thought I was the richest guy in the world.  And I had nothing but blue sky ahead of me.  And that's where I was going.  Join me tomorrow for another XM Pure Golf Radio Minute.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio. 
[01:24:00]  XM Satellite Radio.  Radio to the power of X.  Prepare to be wowed.  What knockers.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow.  Yeah, we're on, Opie. 
[01:24:30]  Where you been?  Getting a little cup of tea, are you?  Green tea.  A little holiday warmth.  All right, where are we?  Oh, we're doing a radio show.  Hey.  We don't have to defend.  I'm going to hang up on a lot of people here.  We don't have to defend Jimmy.  We like Jimmy.  Bill from California.  What's going on?  Hold on a second.  I've got to do this, that.  Okay.  Go ahead, Bill.  Hey, what's up, man? 
[01:25:00]  You guys rock.  You finally got a little Jimmy Norton's rim boy off the radio, but you need to get the  gay out of your radio.  Yesterday, with Tippy Tom, the homeless guy, whacking it.  That was pretty cool.  It wasn't.  I've got to be careful how I say this.  It wasn't really gay.  It was more of a freak show.  Disgusting, dude.  All right?  Yeah, he is about a freak.  And there were chicks in the studio, so he made it okay.  Yeah.  And rim boy isn't gone forever, sir.  Don't delude yourself.  It's just taking a rest for now. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, man.  No more rim boy, man.  I want to puke when I hear that.  Well, sir, that's the point.  It's about taking someone's medicine.  No one likes to take their medicine.  But it's for your own good.  There you have it.  All right.  Thank you, Bill.  Let's go to Ellis in Philly.  What's up, Ellis?  Hey, guys.  You got to hear the Philly sticker stop at Red Line in the Boulevard.  This is our marketing.  I want to say it again.  This is our marketing.  It's our listeners taking it upon themselves to get a pile of wow stickers and then hang  out in a parking lot somewhere.  Ellis.  This is instead of the national TV spot that we were supposed to have. 
[01:26:00]  Well, we did have.  I'm not going to say what went on, but we did have a marketing meeting recently that went  really better than expected.  Really?  Where was I?  You had a meeting.  Remember how good that went?  Where was I?  Yeah, I heard a recap.  I just heard this.  I had to miss it.  Oh, fantastic.  All I heard was there's good things planned for 2005.  No, the 0-4.  Anyone say 2005?  I heard 0-5.  0-5.  Corporate lingo.  0-4 and 0-5.  All right, Ellis.  How's the wow sticker stop going?  Spickens attack. 
[01:26:30]  We have tons of people stopping by.  It's great.  We have no chicks stopping by yet.  How many people are stopping by?  Probably had about 30 come through already.  No kidding.  There you go.  All right.  Where are you guys?  We're actually right at the boulevard at Redline Road and Roosevelt Boulevard in the  far northeast near the Best Buy.  Okay.  Hans, boobie, I'm your white knight.  Ellis.  Yeah.  Yes.  What's that from?  Die hard.  Oh, okay. 
[01:27:00]  Ellis, thank you so much.  Hopefully, Beckinsley talk.  I didn't get the first one.  That guy's such a tool.  Ellis, hopefully some women will stop by and flash it for taking care of us today, okay?  I hope so.  The rain's stopping.  We got a camera.  We got a whole bunch of whack baggers out here.  It's great.  Awesome.  Have a good time, all right?  Thanks.  Okay, let's go.  Bye, Ellis.  Tom on Long Island.  What's up, Tom?  Tom?  Tom?  Hello.  Tom?  All right.  Tom's gone.  All right, Anthony, we got some audio of OJ Simpson. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, the latest OJ.  And you got the story, too, right?  Oh, yeah.  OJ, any time you see that O.J. in any headline, you know it's going to be entertaining.  OJ has now given us over a decade of fun and joy and happiness in the news.  Any time a story about OJ pops up in the news, I run to it.  Right.  I'm still fascinated by OJ.  Can I play the clip real fast?  It's 10 seconds.  And then you have more in that article there. 
[01:28:00]  To Fred's face in debtor hearings, if I have to work to pay them, I won't work.  It's that simple.  So I'll just play golf every day.  Oh, this son of a bitch.  You know, what is Fred Goldman waiting for?  Just kill him.  Kill him.  What is he waiting for?  You have to take one for the team.  You have to kill OJ.  You'll go to jail.  Probably not for a long time, I don't think. 
[01:28:30]  They'll call him a racist.  Oh, well, they'll probably pull that card out.  You shot the black man who murdered his son.  You know something?  What is Fred Goldman waiting for at this point?  You have to kill OJ.  Now OJ's basically saying, OJ owes Fred Goldman and the family there how much?  $33.5 million.  And OJ has decided he will not pay them a dime.  He'd rather play golf all day because if he works, here's OJ's situation. 
[01:29:00]  Here's what poor OJ, the situation he's in.  Lives down in Florida.  He's got a $575,000 house in Florida, which is pretty good in Florida.  Sure.  He collects $30,000 a month from his NFL pension.  A month.  $30,000 every month.  The pension, by law, cannot be touched by the victim's families.  So he's got this coming in for some reason.  Why is that?  Why can't you sue this guy?  He's making $30,000 a month.  And they can't sap any money out of that because of some law. 
[01:29:30]  It's probably for old people or some people that are making, you know, obviously, you know, $1,500 a month.  You can't tap into a lawsuit.  In the future, his annuity will pay him as much as $125,000 a month.  So I guess that goes up.  If he works, if he does any work, any money he makes from working, a percentage of that will go to pay this $33.5 million to the Goldman family.  So he refuses to work.  That's brilliant. 
[01:30:00]  It is.  And he mocks Fred Goldman in the process.  And now, you remember when this first happened and he was acquitted, he walked around and he didn't say much about anything.  Well, I'm going to find a real killer and, you know, play some golf and get on with my life.  And he really didn't talk about the family or anything.  Now, he's just going on shows.  Ah, Fred Goldman.  Hey, fuck him if he can't take a dead son.  Ha ha ha.  Now, what does he say about Fred?  Come on, kill me, pussy.  What does he say about Fred Goldman and how he didn't really like his son that much or didn't love his son as much as, uh. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, Simpson also took his cruelest pot shot to date at Fred Goldman, saying, quote,  he didn't care about his son when he was alive and accusing the dad of trying to make money off his son in the grave.  What is Fred Goldman waiting for?  And Fred Goldman's got to take this.  The accusations rolled off Goldman, who called Simpson a liar and a murderer.  Ooh, revelation.  You know how hard that's got to be, though, when you're waiting for money and it's contingent upon a black guy working? 
[01:31:00]  Oh, my goodness.  That's why half the people love you and half the people hate you.  Boy, that was a good line.  Perfect example.  A great line.  It was, it was, there was some, can you tell you to it?  You don't say that guy I called in doesn't hate me.  Don't worry about it.  I'm just messing with you.  No, no, no, no, no, I'm saying he doesn't hate me.  Anthony, maybe this could be the latest game, like that JFK thing we were talking about yesterday.  See?  Everyone's up in arms about the JFK game, which I was playing yesterday.  Unbelievable.  I cannot now make the money shot. 
[01:31:30]  That third shot.  You guys laughed at me yesterday.  Because you were taking the wrong shot.  I was taking the best shot I had at Kennedy.  You know, a lot of new listeners, because they're turning on their radios every day,  so it's the JFK game everyone's talking about.  You download the game online.  A lot of people just outraged.  You're in the window, sixth floor, book depository building,  and the motorcade comes around the corner.  It's coming right at you, and then it turns, kind of in front of you outside the window,  and now you've got to take the shots.  I've been taking the shots at the front of Kennedy's face. 
[01:32:00]  I know.  Anyone would have.  Of course it's the best shot.  That's why Oswald had help, or didn't do it at all.  Everyone's saying.  So it now makes the turn, and now you've got to take the shot,  kind of threw some leaves from behind.  Why would he wait to take the shot there?  Maybe because he was late.  All I could think of.  Maybe he got up to the sixth floor a little late.  All I could think of is if you're hanging out the window with a rifle,  directly in front of them,  somebody in the car, one of the Secret Service guys, might get a view of you. 
[01:32:30]  See, that's why this game is great.  Because now you're in the same spot Oswald was,  and you're not following the logic of the Warren Commission.  Let me tell you something.  I now agree with the game maker.  At first I was like, kind of, yeah, this guy's full of shit.  It's just about getting this game out there.  It's a little sensationalism, and it's gory, it's morbid, it's a...  Well, the guy's smart.  I mean, he's making money,  and he's also figured out a way to make it kind of legit.  His whole thing on it, yeah, is saying that it's like a research tool.  It's some kind of research tool that the common man can now put himself in this situation 
[01:33:00]  and see how difficult it would have been to make that shot.  And I got to agree.  It kind of is interesting that it's so easy to take that front shot at Kennedy,  and then when they make that turn,  and now you're very high up,  your angle from the window down to the car is a very steep angle.  And then from the back, with the leaves of the tree in the way,  it's a very difficult shot.  So now I've been shooting the first shot and missing.  That's what they say the first shot did. 
[01:33:30]  But you've got to miss in the right spot to get a point.  You've got to hit the curb, I think, under the overpass.  Yep.  Next to that dude, whatever his name was.  Oh, sorry.  The second shot has to go through Kennedy and out and then hit Connelly,  which I've done.  That would be the magic bullet, right?  Yeah, the magic bullet.  I did that.  And then the third shot, the money shot, I just cannot pull off.  I wind up hitting Jackie in the throat.  I hit Connelly's wife. 
[01:34:00]  I cannot get that money shot.  The old busting head shot.  Very difficult.  Does Anthony run out of the building where he could have?  No, he stops and has a Coke.  You keep getting distracted up there, do you?  Sucking David Ferry's cock.  All painted in gold.  Wow.  Oh, what have we here?  Cage from Whackbag.com.  He photoshopped you as Oswald in a bunch of shots. 
[01:34:30]  Very funny.  Hilarious.  Go to Whackbag.com for some photoshop.  That is a great one.  I see a trend happening, though.  I see a trend.  This game is kind of cool.  And why not have an O.J. game?  You could actually have O.J. at the murder scene killing his ex-wife and Ron Goldman.  That would be interesting.  Your O.J.  You know, was it him or was it two people that were selling drugs to my ex-wife?  Was it two people?  It was Pedro Guerrero.  Was it Pedro Guerrero in the trunk with the drugs? 
[01:35:00]  Pedro Guerrero.  Was it one of the guys that was banging my ex-wife and driving around in my car that I bought the bitch?  Right.  Or was it me after, you know, use your mouse to circle around the house and watch my wife giving head to someone on the couch while I hit the outrage button on my computer?  This game is lovely.  I love this game.  You are O.J.  Do you choose your Bruno Mali shoes like I did that night to track blood up and down my pathway? 
[01:35:30]  Do you use your Heisman Trophy to take care of business?  You know, that's the beauty of this game.  I could either cut their throats or go way off the game plan and beat them over the head with my Heisman Trophy.  That is so much fun.  Look what happens when I press the B key.  The B key?  That's the bell the limo driver keeps ringing.  Ding dong.  Ding dong.  Ding dong.  Ding dong.  Ding dong.  Hello, O.J.? 
[01:36:00]  O.J.?  Ding dong.  O.J., I'm waiting out here.  I'm in the limo.  I'm here to pick you up.  Ding dong.  O.J.?  O.J.  O.J.'s not picking up.  Is he even...  Hey.  Oh, there he goes.  Oh, O.J.'s running past my limo, dressed all in black.  He's running behind the house.  No, I swear I know that's O.J.  Ding dong.  O.J.  Yeah?  O.J., where were you?  I was out back chipping golf balls. 
[01:36:30]  No, but I saw you run past me in a black sweatsuit with a...  No, no.  No, you didn't.  And you didn't see me drop no gloves, neither.  Or hit Kato's air conditioner.  None of that.  It's all included in my new video game, O.J. on a killer rampage.  Now you click the mouse button and drop the glove.  Yeah.  Oh.  And then you get on a flight.  Hey, look at us.  Get on a plane.  Hey, look at that.  Wow, look at us.  We're on the TV. 
[01:37:00]  Holding up XM satellite equipment.  Oh, I thought that was the new Sirius Walkman.  You were holding up.  Wow, all right.  We'll get the audio of that newscast.  We're all over the news today.  All over.  Anyway, sorry, Anthony.  Took you out of the game.  That's all right.  I like another game, though, would be Ron Goldman getting to hunt O.J.  with the same crosshairs that you use in the Kennedy game.  Can he shoot me?  Was he shooting me from the clubhouse or from the grassy fairway? 
[01:37:30]  Was there another gunman in the sand trap?  As O.J. is just tooling around on a golf cart.  On a golf cart.  You got to take.  You know Ron Goldman's dad trying to take pot shots at him as he drives in his golf cart.  Well, with cowlings there.  The motorcade makes his way.  No, the golf cart makes his way.  The golf cart motorcade is rounding the corner by the second hole.  Makes the turn at the halfway house after getting a hot dog. 
[01:38:00]  I get a hot dog.  The first shot hits a divot and clips Kardashian in the face.  AC's driving the golf cart.  Yeah, my buddy Al Cowling is driving.  Yeah, Al Cowling.  It's a slow speed chase of my golf ball down the fairway.  I think I see a trend.  I'd play that game.  Who wouldn't?  Yeah, he's just got to kill him, though.  Where's the O.J. crank calls? 
[01:38:30]  He's such a pussy.  Fred Goldman.  Just kill the guy.  Remember that guy that years ago his son was molested by some guy?  Karate instructor and he shot him while he was on the phone.  He shot him right when they were bringing him into the court building.  That's how you do it.  This guy was standing by a payphone like he's on the telephone.  Right.  The cops bring this molester by him and they got it on video.  It's great.  He just spins around, one shot, right in the head, drops the gun, puts his hands up like, 
[01:39:00]  yep, there you go.  Done.  My job as a father is complete.  You can't count on the court system.  Acquitted, too, by the way, as justifiable homicide, that guy.  There you go.  I believe.  Nice.  And it was.  And do you think Ron Goldman, I mean, Ron Goldman's father, what the hell is his name?  Fred.  Fred.  Fred.  Fred Goldman.  Do you think a jury down there in Florida, Florida would really, you know, throw the book  at him?  He's just taunting Fred at this point. 
[01:39:30]  He is.  I dare you to kill me.  That's his next quote.  Hey, Fred, come and get me.  You're a pussy.  I laid a smack down on you.  Talking all kinds of shit.  Yeah.  Ron squealed like a stuck Irish pig.  Oh, man.  Anthony, we have the Kid Chris OJ prank calls.  We love this thing.  Oh, yeah.  Kid Chris, kind of a friend of the show.  One day he is, one day he's not.  Yeah.  I think today he's a friend of the show. 
[01:40:00]  You don't find many sincere friendships in radio.  Not at all.  But, you know, we love this thing.  He actually got a hold of OJ and messed with him.  Yeah, he got OJ's cell phone number and was making a little prank callstone.  Pretty funny.  Yeah.  Oh, Juice?  Yeah.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Who's this?  This is AC.  Let's go kill somebody tonight.  Bye.  Juice?  Yeah, hello. 
[01:40:30]  OJ.  Who's this?  It's Al Michaels.  My wife's been acting like a real bitch.  I was wondering if he could help me kill her.  What do you say, champ?  Do I know you?  Hey.  Juice, it's Chris Rock.  It's me, Chris Rock, Juice.  What do you say you and I go kill the Spice Girls?  Juice, every time I call you, I always be laughing. 
[01:41:00]  Hello?  Juice, you're late.  We're supposed to go out and kill people tonight.  What's going on?  I really can't talk.  I'm at dinner with a bunch of people, and I have no idea who you are.  I'm the real killer.  OJ.  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah, Juice.  Yeah?  Juice, what's up?  Who is it?  It's Dan Dierdorf.  You want to go throw the ball around, you know, have some beers, maybe kill somebody?  Yeah? 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  Hi, OJ.  It's Kato.  Well, I want to go pick up some young girls and kill them.  We can hold them underwater or something.  How'd I go?  Can I move in with you?  Hello?  Hi, OJ.  Hey.  Hey, it's Marcus Allen.  Want to go get some bitches and kill them?  God. 
[01:42:00]  I love that.  Want to go get some bitches and kill them?  Ouch.  So there you have it.  The OJ prank calls.  Freenick?  Yeah?  It's saying, Anthony would play the OJ game by hacking at the back of their necks, wondering  why he couldn't get the high score.  Very funny, you ass.  Very, very good callback.  Maybe someone else mentioned the Andrea Yates game.  Oh!  And maybe you could play it by putting them all in sand. 
[01:42:30]  Jesus.  You've got serious problems.  Why?  I don't want to drown those five little burdens.  You've got serious problems.  I'm the one that...  I didn't do anything.  I just report.  Right.  Now I agree with that caller from Jersey.  You're awful.  He loves me, that guy.  Jerry from Michigan, what's up?  I have to put on my fake mustache.  Oh, look how I threw the cops off.  A click of the mouse.  I hit the M key for the fake mustache.  Oh, no, they're still after me.  Go, OJ, go.  I have to use the game's mapping system to find my mama's house. 
[01:43:00]  Because that's where I'm headed.  I'm not going to Mexico with a bag of money.  Or am I?  You never know.  Play the OJ game.  Fucking OJ.  You know what?  You know something like that's going to come out of it.  Oh.  Jerry, what's up?  I've got a new game for you guys.  Okay.  It's a Ted Kennedy game.  We might as well keep it all in the family.  Yeah, you know, why not make the Chappaquiddick game? 
[01:43:30]  The Ted Kennedy driving game?  1969 Oldsmobile.  Try to get across the bridge.  Oops.  See how long it takes you to get out of the seatbelt.  Get out of the car.  Tries to pull an evil Knievel.  Doesn't quite make it.  What does he do?  Do I click the mouse and save the broad or go home and take a nap?  I say sleep it off.  Ick ben I'm drunk.  I stood there by the shoreline until I saw the bubbles stop. 
[01:44:00]  You've got to wonder what he did.  That would be great.  Like GTA, you're driving around, big fat Ted head in the back of the car.  Oops.  Here you come.  Simulating being drunk.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah, you can't, like, work the mouse to have him walk.  He's just staggering home.  Very hard to work the mouse.  Stagger home. 
[01:44:30]  He swam across.  I keep trying to hit the alibi key, but nothing's coming up.  It's not working.  He'll get off the hook.  Just hit that K key, the Kennedy name.  There it is.  Out of trouble.  Oh, brother.  Let's say hi to Eric in Jersey.  Hey, Eric.  Hey, what's going on, man?  We're hanging.  Last day before a little vacation.  Try to catch my game where you try to walk your way through the kitchen. 
[01:45:00]  Circumnavigate your way through pots and pans until you hear the crack of a gunshot.  Or try my game where you play football skiing down a mountainside.  Well, how about mine?  Will you fly with a busted leg?  Can you land a plane in Martha's Vineyard as your new wife babbles behind you? 
[01:45:30]  Oh, wow.  She spilt my coffee.  Or play my game where you beat a broad about the head with a golf club after jacking it  in a tree.  Where in the world is Martha Moxley?  Yeah, boy, the Kennedys could have a bunch of games. 
[01:46:00]  What are they outraged about the first one?  I could think of five more.  That would be a lot worse.  Oh, wow.  Try my game where you give a lobotomy to your retired daughter.  That only works.  That game only kicks in.  It's level two. 
[01:46:30]  Level one of that game is when the hangar fails.  In the back room of the Kennedy complex.  God, that was a good reference.  Uncle Ted makes an appearance in the other game, too.  Where you have to rape a girl on the front lawn of the compound.  You're forgetting one.  What did you just write? 
[01:47:00]  There's another Kennedy son that died.  That would be Joe.  Oh, what happened to him?  He crashed during what?  World War II.  World War II.  English Channel.  Oh, see?  I didn't know the detail.  He was supposed to be the president.  He was.  They were grooming him to be the president.  Oh.  And then they had to go with their second choice, JFK.  Look how that turned out. 
[01:47:30]  You pulled out Michael, though.  That was a great one.  Yeah, Michael.  Michael Kennedy Smith was a fantastic one.  Michael Kennedy Smith.  They love being like peripheral Kennedys and dropping that name in there.  Wouldn't you?  Greg Opie Kennedy Hughes?  Why not?  I would use that.  I want to be Anthony Kennedy Kumiya now.  Just for the fuck of it.  Why not?  So I can get away with stuff.  Yeah, I raped the bitch, but I'm Anthony Kennedy Hughes.  We're all related.  We're all related somehow if you believe in Adam and Eve.  Sure.  Robert Kennedy Chambers? 
[01:48:00]  Poor boy can't shake that awful girl's legacy.  Let him get on with his life.  You choke a whore with a sweater and all of a sudden, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.  You can't get out of jail and do drugs anymore.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  They caught him for drugs.  I know.  They caught him for.  The preppy killer was busted.  Isn't it awful to be an older guy now and be the preppy killer?  Yeah.  It was cool when you were the little preppy guy.  But now he's like the old guy killer.  He's one of the best looking guys on earth. 
[01:48:30]  He was like a nine and a half when he went to jail.  What a dope.  All that ass you were getting on the Upper West Side.  He was nabbed in a traffic stop and they found powder in his car, Anthony.  He was up in Harlem.  He was up in the Harlem area.  They pulled him over.  What?  No inspection sticker and suspended license.  And then they found all sorts of powder in his car.  You know, I still don't have my inspection sticker.  I picked up my car, I think, in August.  Or maybe July.  And I still, I keep forgetting until I get stopped at like the tunnel. 
[01:49:00]  And they point it out or write me a ticket.  And this morning I got yelled at at the Midtown Tunnel.  It's 4.30 in the morning.  I got yelled at at the Midtown Tunnel for going too fast.  But you know what happened?  There was a van in front of me and he took one of the easy pass lanes and I knew I had  to get through there in front of the van or I was going to be stuck behind him the whole  time through the tunnel, which is just ponderous.  I like driving through the tunnel so it looks like... 
[01:49:30]  I like the size of the tunnel to look like that scene in Battlestar Galactica where they  launch the fighter ship.  I just like watching the walls whiz on by.  Just flying by.  Yeah.  And I wanted to get in front of the van.  So I go through and I swear the gate comes up a second before it hits my hood.  I love that.  So I go screaming through and I stop like an idiot.  It's one of the Port Authority, Tunnel, the Tunnel Authority cops.  You know what this...  And then they got a quiz here at 4.30 in the morning. 
[01:50:00]  You know what the speed limit is through the plaza?  I go 15.  Why do they have to ask that question?  He goes no.  I go 10.  No.  Seven.  Five.  Seven and a half.  I go five.  He goes five miles an hour.  Those asses.  Why do they ask that when they pull you over for speeding?  I go, I don't know.  The sign's behind me now.  Right, right, right.  I was doing just fine.  You should have said 50 miles an hour.  Yelled at me.  Like it should be.  Because, you know, we got cameras here and we could tell how fast you're going and we'll... 
[01:50:30]  Whatever.  Yeah.  What?  Whatever.  Eric, I don't know if it's going to make sense anymore, but you've been on hold for about  10 minutes here.  Oh!  What's going on?  No, I was just going to say you guys should make a Sex for Sam game where you have to sneak  around New York and have sex in different places.  You get caught, oh, and they get thrown off the air.  Oh, that's a good one.  Yeah, that'll make us very happy.  Yeah, I play that one.  Well, thank you, Eric.  It will lead to the latest newscast we're on. 
[01:51:00]  What happened?  Which one are we going?  Just say the line.  Sick puppy.  Oh, yeah.  Sick puppy, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing today?  Hey, good.  I got to tell you, first off, you guys are the only reason why you even got XM Radio.  Oh, there you go.  Thank you.  Well, do us a favor and tell your friends, okay?  I'll go doing another thing.  You forgot one important game.  What?  I got William Shatnick killing his wife.  Oh, killing his wife.  Allegedly.  Nobody even talks about that anymore.  I never killed a bitch. 
[01:51:30]  I just didn't go for help right away.  She's in the heat.  She's got a laser in the pool.  Does he call 911?  Does he pull her out of the pool?  No.  He stops and has a Coke.  She's an idiot.  She was taking a drunken swim.  I had to watch her think to the bottom.  Again, I, like Kennedy, just waited for the bubbles to stop. 
[01:52:00]  And I waved a pepper shaker over her and went...  It said she was...  I can't believe it.  I called 911.  Hypothermia was setting in.  Time was of the essence.  Every friggin' time.  Yes.  Someone could die in a fire on Rescue 911.  Time was of the essence.  Hypothermia was setting in. 
[01:52:30]  Called 911.  He's the host of Rescue 911, and his wife drowns right there in the pool.  He didn't know what to do.  That burdensome wife.  No, he knew what to do.  Oh, he knew what to do.  He knew what to do.  One, 1,000.  Two, 1,000.  Honey, I'll call after the count of three.  One.  One, 1,000.  Two.  I remember when I married you. 
[01:53:00]  You were a beautiful woman.  Now you lay there at the bottom of a pool.  Lifeless like Spock behind the glass when gone.  Set off the Genesis Divide.  Gone!  Gone!  Perhaps I should grab my communicator and call Bones.  Yeah, Bones, beam down to my pool.  My wife seems to be drowning. 
[01:53:30]  Enterprise, hello.  Bones.  Scotty.  I love how it's the future, and he would turn dials on his communicator and actually tap it.  Yeah.  Come on, Bones.  Pick up.  All right, you've reached Bones.  No one's home right now.  Leave a message after the beep.  Beep.  Yeah, Bones.  My wife seems to be dying in the pool.  Perhaps, uh, you know, if you get this early enough, give me a call back. 
[01:54:00]  All right.  Hello?  I know you might be screening.  I'm waiting.  You know, busy in sickbay.  Don't want to pick up.  Maybe trying to pick up on that bitch.  Remember that bitch you were with, and she turned out to be a salt-sucking monster?  That's a lot like my marriage.  That's why I'm letting the bitch drown in the pool.  She was a money-sucking monster.  I'd get my bills at the end of the month and review them, and the horrified look on my face was much like the look when I looked out the window and saw the monster on the wing. 
[01:54:30]  There's a man on the wing.  There's $5,000 dead on my Amex.  Same face.  The bubbles seem to be stopping.  All right, Bones.  Well, if you get this, give me a call back.  Hi, Spock.  Your home pickup.  I'm starting to think everyone's annoying me.  Spock. 
[01:55:00]  Hello, Spock.  Maybe it's Amok time.  Every seven years, Spock gets horny, got to go back to Vulcan.  Is that what it is?  I know the pain it must be for a being like you, so logical, to be thrown into chaos like this.  That's how I felt every time my Amex bill came in.  Bitch could spend, spend, spend, spend, spend.  Oh, the bubbles did stop, and now she's got that glazed over look in her eye, looking up at me, from the bottom of the pool.  All right, Spock. 
[01:55:30]  You get in.  Give me a call.  Oh, it was a video game.  Rob Hogan, nice.  Just sitting back and watching you guys rocks.  God, is that funny?  All right, we can continue here.  There's a million of them coming in now.  Rob from Long Island.  What's up, Rob?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, how about the Sonny Bono game?  You know, skiing down the slope, trying to, like, dodge all those trees.  Ah, the same one.  Trying to avoid the trees. 
[01:56:00]  What a way.  Imagine that two people go the same way.  Two, like, famous people go the same way.  Hitting a tree.  That's why I never liked watching Opie ski.  Because me skiing, we went skiing once.  And I'm too new at it, and I'm really bad.  So I, you know, pizza pie wedge down the mountain.  I don't know what I'm doing when I ski.  Opie's just reckless.  You and our old pal Jay, though, scared the crap out of everybody else that went that weekend.  It's because we were skiing down a mountain very slowly. 
[01:56:30]  You decided to go to the top of the mountain just as the ski lifts were closing,  and it took you well over an hour to get down.  It was dark.  We walked down a mountain on skis.  It was dark.  Yeah.  And we're going to the first aid area and everything.  We were all hammered, too.  We were drinking all day.  Smoking.  We're up on the mountain.  Yeah, one more cigarette.  We'll go down.  Awful.  And then Opie's just reckless.  Like, he comes, think.  He's the guy that, like, as you're just struggling to stand up, he comes, 
[01:57:00]  whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.  Hey, guys.  See you at the bottom.  Whoosh, whoosh.  Thank you, son of a...  That's how I inline skate in the park, too.  But he's looking behind you.  In and out of cars and everything now.  He looks behind him.  Make sure you're okay.  Ugh.  I don't know.  But I always worry that you're going to, you know, hit a tree.  No, I don't do that tree skiing.  No?  No.  That's what Sonny Bono was doing.  Skiing, using the trees.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of the kids love tree skiing. 
[01:57:30]  It's nuts.  You really have to know what you're doing.  You see them skiing down those rocks sometimes.  They go right over the big boulders.  That's a piece of cake compared to when they go in the woods.  Because, you know, these trees come at you fast, obviously.  Yeah.  And if you're not turning really, really quick, you're going to bite it.  Actually, I don't think the trees are coming at you.  Well...  I could be wrong.  Yeah, but technically, it feels that way when you're on skis.  And that would be really dangerous.  Because when you're on skis, you feel like you're actually not moving and everything else  is coming at you.  Yeah, coming at you.  I think a dolphin could ski. 
[01:58:00]  I think he could maybe...  I think he could snowboard before he could ski.  Yeah, strap the fins in a lot easier than putting two skis on one fin.  But maybe Sonny Bono was just, like, skiing a little, you know, near the edge of the trail  and then, like, you know, hit a rock or something.  Right, because the trees are right on the edge of the trail.  I see the people do that, too.  That's nuts.  But he was supposed to be a pretty good skier.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  A little conversation about Sonny Bono's skiing.  We got Ozzy on the line. 
[01:58:30]  We got Ozzy on the line.  We have news reports.  What do you want to do?  Here's the latest news report.  We're all over the news today.  The latest?  This is just aired?  Anthony, since you did that whole bit, I saw our faces on TV another two times.  Oh!  I was only able to see yours live.  It's a huge story.  FCC and Viacom settled for $3.5 million on outstanding fines, including you and I, Anthony.  Actually, they're mentioning us the most in this mess that they're cleaning up with the FCC. 
[01:59:00]  You know, the Sex with Sam thing.  We were fined $357,000.  A lot of money.  I think we finally don't have anything, any connection to Viacom anymore, officially.  No more FCC complaints looming over us.  There were two complaints.  I know.  This is something that even surprised me.  I know there was the Sex for Sam.  Right.  But there was another complaint that they settled with this.  Right.  And which one was that?  You know, it was the Drew Boogie remix.  Dare I say, Jim Cook was involved in that FCC complaint, too. 
[01:59:30]  What happened was we had Jim Cook come in, we had a teenager come in, and we were doing double entendre humor.  Yeah.  Talking about beer, but it sounded like it could have been us talking about sex.  Creamy head.  So, as far as a broadcast that day, totally clean.  It really was.  You might be outraged as a parent or whatever listening to this stuff on the radio, but Anthony and I are smart.  We know how far to take it.  We're smart!  That broadcast was completely clean.  Yeah.  Do you remember some of the lines that you were doing a lot of them as Jim Cook, talking about the creamy head? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Put the bottle in your mouth, suck it.  Suck it and all that stuff.  Yeah.  It was double entendre.  We were talking about beer.  Okay?  It's something that...  Suck my...  Something about the tall man.  Suck my creamy head.  I don't know.  Whatever.  Grab on and suck it dry.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  And in the context of talking about the beer, it was fine.  When he cut it up...  He cut it up.  ...and put it in the song, it was all of a sudden taken out of the context of talking about beer and used only as like a sex talk.  And now it sounds like a teenager's talking about sex and sucking junk and stuff. 
[02:00:30]  And then they were outraged.  Outraged.  And actually, when Mel was in front of the commission, the senators down there in Washington, when they were having the hearings,  when was that?  Like last February?  Yeah, about a year or so ago.  They were quoting lines from that bit.  Yeah.  Very proud moment watching C-SPAN and seeing that happen.  So that one we were guilty for.  I'll admit that.  Not the original broadcast, but the fact that we played the Drew Boogie on the air. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, Drew Boogie got us fined.  That one slid past us.  But as far as the Sex for Sam thing, the $357,000 fine, got to say it once again today, pretty much for the last time.  That was a clean show.  So, like it or not, as far as the radio broadcast goes, it was clean.  It was not.  But it's obvious Viacom is cleaning up all this old business with the FCC, because I think they're going to be moving on to some things in the near future.  Anyway, so here's one of the newscasts that came in while you were doing that. 
[02:01:30]  You think there's a bunch of horses out there playing a Christopher Reeve game?  Well, you've got to buck them off just right.  Reload.  Try it again.  Just a thought.  Let's take a listen to this audio.  CBS's parent company, Viacom, now agreeing to pay the government $3.5 million.  The settlement will end a trio of pending indecency investigations by the FCC.  One involved shock jock Howard Stern, the two others stemming from the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:02:00]  Viacom will also install additional audio delay systems at stations airing live shows.  Despite the record settlement, Viacom says it'll still fight the half-million-dollar Janet Jackson fine.  That came after the infamous wardrobe malfunction during last year's Super Bowl.  There you have it.  It's huge news today everywhere, so they're coming in like crazy.  We'll get a few more of the newscasts on the radio.  Was that from WB?  Yeah, that was Channel 11 here in New York.  All right.  Did they say anything about us being back on the air anywhere?  No. 
[02:02:30]  No.  Good, thanks.  No, not at all.  Thank you.  Thanks for the help.  As we go to break, here's a song about the FCC, Anthony.  Oh.  We love this little thing, and we'll continue.  What's going on with the girls, by the way?  There's like three or four really hot girls here.  I'll say.  Everyone's just...  Yeah, they're all in the fish tank over there, just throwing their arms up in the air, shaking heads.  I don't know.  I don't...  I...  I...  They're like...  I...  Eric, Sex Bagel?  What? 
[02:03:00]  Eric.  Look at Sully from Godsmack in there.  Where?  Oh, yeah, he does look like Sully.  Very good.  It's a little too tall, though.  Go ahead, Sex Bagel.  I don't know.  Somebody said come in here.  Oh, my God.  The boss would like to know what's up with the girls.  When we're doing this kick-ass radio and Anthony goes off on a 20-minute tangent, what are you guys actually doing?  Are you guys doing stuff?  I was, yeah.  I was finishing the rest of the program.  Working very diligently.  All right.  We want to know what's going on with the women.  These three lovely ladies here are big fans. 
[02:03:30]  They all work for our pal Ziggy.  So he was bringing a bunch of equipment down for various people around here.  What does Ziggy do that they all work for him?  Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner, and Ziggy.  I heard him call him Ziggy, Ralph.  They're all huge fans.  They begged to come down with him.  Ah, so they're just going to sit and watch, aren't they?  He's like, oh, we want to say hi to the guys.  We thought these were the girls that were getting naked today, and instead we're going to get a bunch of slobs coming in in about a half hour.  Do we have girls coming in?  I thought these were the girls. 
[02:04:00]  We were getting very excited.  They're way too hot.  I'm trying to get them to wow them.  Why do you think we've been trying extra hard today, making them laugh?  We don't do it for our listeners.  We're doing it for the hot pieces of asses.  Take a look inside the studio.  Which one is Ziggy's girlfriend so I know who not to leer at?  Something very self-conscious.  I like Ziggy.  Probably that one.  Right there.  All right.  Leering or stalk?  The other two are a fair game.  All right.  All right, so they're just going to watch.  Let me apologize to Ziggy.  They're watchers.  I'm trying to give them the wow.  All right, they're watchers, Anthony.  All right, that's fine. 
[02:04:30]  And I hear Ralphie Mays here?  Yep, he's all set and ready.  Okay.  As we go to break, the FCC song.  Here's a little number I wrote the other day while out duck hunting with a judge.  Quack.  Fuck you very much, the FCC.  Fuck you very much for fining me.  Five thousand bucks a fuck, so I'm really out of luck.  That's more than Heidi Fleiss was judging me.  So fuck you very much, dear Mr. Bush. 
[02:05:00]  For heroically sitting on your tush.  For Halliburton, Enron, all the companies who fail.  Let's send them a clear signal and stick Martha straight in jail.  She's an uppity rich bitch and at least she isn't male.  So fuck you all so very much.  So fuck you dickhead, Mr. Cheney too.  Fuck you and fuck everything you do. 
[02:05:30]  Your pacemaker must be a fake.  You haven't got a heart.  As far as I'm concerned, you're just a pasty-faced old fart.  And as for Condoleezza, she's an intellectual tart.  So fuck you all so very much.  So fuck you very much, the EPA.  For giving all Alaska's oil away.  It really is a bummer when I can't fill my hummer.  The ozone's a no-go zone now that Arnold's here to say. 
[02:06:00]  The nuclear winter games are going to take place in L.A.  So fuck you all so very much.  So what the planet fails.  Let's save the great white males.  And fuck you all so very much.  Quack.  So I was in the grocery store and there was this stock boy stacking melons.  So I figured, hey, I'll show him some real melons.  Well, when I flashed him, he lost his balance  and the entire stack of melons came crashing down on him. 
[02:06:30]  He was suffocated under two tons of melons.  But my melons are still juicy and perky.  Please wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the O.P. and Anthony Show.

I've had it with Oprah and Ricky Lake.  And my whole act is just a knee-jerk reaction to all this fake compassion and shit.  Everybody's a victim in this country.  Everybody's suing everybody.  Nobody's responsible for their own behavior. 
[02:08:00]  My favorite victim is this lady.  Have you heard about her?  She's 5'4", 390 pounds, and she's suing a movie theater because the seats are too small.  I don't think that's the problem.  Problem is your ass is a fire hazard.  Imagine you couldn't get out of a burning theater because the ushers couldn't free Willie from the emergency exits.  Not to pick on fat people, but 9 out of 10 asses fit in the seats at the movies. 
[02:08:30]  So don't change the law for one donut monster, all right?  Do you know what the lawsuit's about, folks?  She wants to bring her own chair to the movie theater.  Why, to bring a couch, a bed?  Who gives a crap, you know?  It's not bad enough I can't see the screen because some guy's wearing a hat in front of me.  Now I can't see it because Mama Cass' Craftmatic is stuck in the upright position. 
[02:09:00]  And she's going to win the lawsuit because she's covered under something called the Disability Act.  Only in this country are obese people considered disabled.  If you're missing an arm or a leg, you're disabled.  If you're missing a cheesecake, you're full.  You don't get special parking at the mall because you had too much pizza, okay?  Where should we park, Betty?  Yeah, right by the food court. 
[02:09:30]  Again, not to be insensitive, but I am.  I like that about me.  I'm crippled because I'm fat.  No, you're fat because you're fat.  Put down the shovel, get away from the buffet table, and we'll chat.  Just put on a red ribbon and you'll feel better, okay?  Look at it this way.  Let's say you're 80 years old, right?  And you've been working out all those years. 
[02:10:00]  You've been drinking your mineral water.  You've been eating your vegetables.  And you're 80 years old.  And you look great!  Who cares?  Nobody wants to have sex with you when you're 80.  Not even another 80-year-old.  When's the last time you've seen a hot 80-year-old?  Oh, damn, I'd like to tackle that.  What if you're 80 years old and you have Alzheimer's? 
[02:10:30]  You don't even know you're in good shape.  Well, you are a good audience tonight, aren't you?  It's everything 24-7.  XM-202.  The O&A virus.  It's everything all the time.  Cold-hot bitch!  Just a kiss on the left.  Said I was on my knees.  I'm waiting. 
[02:11:00]  Give me a cold-hot bitch!  She was shaking her hips.  So that was all I needed.  That's pretty.  Ah, the day before Thanksgiving.  Your pals are working.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Having fun today.  Kind of screwing off.  Oh, you get it Monday.  Is it time for smoothie orders?  Yep. 
[02:11:30]  Smoothies for everyone.  Which would mean my stomach will be rumbling about 5, 6 o'clock tonight.  That's when the smoothie decides to make its exit.  It's like crack.  You know, it's not good for you.  But you just have to.  Are they not good for you?  No, I mean, it just kind of rumbles my insides.  I had a massage girl come over last night.  Coffee, please.  Phil needs coffee.  I had a log.  You ever, like, know you have a log in there that you have to do something with? 
[02:12:00]  I know she's on her way over.  And I'm like, if she slips a finger in, it's going to meet resistance.  So I had to go in there and force my system to clean itself and then shower real quick.  Holding my anus open in the shower.  Oh, God.  Doing that move, yeah.  Oh, is she a fatty?  Yeah.  Thanks for sharing.  Sometimes after a real rough bout on the ball, you get in the shower and do that.  You feel a little sting.  Oh, because you've done a little rip from the water.  Yeah.  Like, ooh, that was a rough one. 
[02:12:30]  I did do some battle.  Cut me, Mick.  Yeah, whole milk, thanks.  Bill needs coffee.  Club Soda Kenny's on the line, Anthony.  Ah!  We're getting word that Club Soda Kenny's going to be on HBO tonight.  Now, why is Kenny going to be on HBO?  Inside the NFL, I think?  I hope it's not with his comedy act.  With Florentine?  I'm guessing, because Jim does that and Kenny's always with him.  Awesome.  Let's say hi to Club Soda Kenny.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Morning.  And happy Thanksgiving to all.  Oh, thank you, Kenny. 
[02:13:00]  I give thanks for being your friend.  Just thanks for being our friend.  And what are you doing this fine Thanksgiving day?  Well, I'm celebrating my appearance on Inside the NFL, the very popular HBO show that's going  to premiere tonight at 10 p.m.  And you're on it, huh?  Oh, yes, sir.  Well, it's some other fine comics like Jim Florentine, Don Jameson, and Eric McMahon.  Nice.  And what are you going to be doing on the show? 
[02:13:30]  Skipping, I hope.  Well, no, there's no skipping, but you're going to see some terrific close-ups of me.  Oh.  Do we really want to see close-ups of you, Kenny?  How can't you love that?  So I want to get the word out to all my tens of fans to watch the show.  Hey, make sure you get my profile.  That's right.  What time is the premiere tonight, Kenny?  10 p.m.  That's 2,200 military time.  Most people give the Central and Pacific time. 
[02:14:00]  He gives military time.  Yeah, Ken, is that 7 on the West Coast, Ken?  Or is that 10 there, too?  Of course, genius.  That's 7 o'clock there.  All right, good.  Wow.  You're going to be on HBO tonight, and Anthony and I are going to be at the downtown in Farmingdale.  Yeah.  Checking out tribute bands.  That's right.  Oh, that's cool, man.  Is Sabra Kedavra there or no?  Maybe we should be bodyguarding you, Kenny.  Well, eventually it might turn out that way, because you know how multi-talented I am. 
[02:14:30]  There you go.  Oh, yes.  Yeah, the downtown tonight with Brother Joe's bands, the Journey tribute band and the U2 tribute band.  And all kidding aside, unbelievable how good these guys are.  Yeah, both of them, really good.  Sound just like the band.  Do we have his Journey stuff?  I don't know.  Do we?  We should play a piece of Joe's tribute band doing Journey.  It's unbelievable.  It sounds just like the original.  I've only seen the U2, and they sounded just like it.  And the U2, same thing.  And then we'll all do one of those drunken things at the end of the night where we get up there and blurt out some songs.  Who the hell wants to get up there and do something? 
[02:15:00]  Bunch of men.  Bunch of men just singing.  Yeah.  Come on to me, shirtless.  Kenny?  May I say something?  Yeah, you can say something.  You know, I think my skipping is really catching on because of you guys.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I'm trying to pitch a reality show of everybody just skipping around America.  I would watch that.  Me too.  Faggots, Tuesdays on Showtime.  How terrific is that?  I think it's a chicken short skirt skipping around. 
[02:15:30]  That's hilarious.  Hey, Kenny, we're still working on your theme music.  So far, no one has sent anything in.  I thought Kenny did his own theme song.  He did.  Where's Steve, the production guy?  It's the He's Big and Stupid song.  Yeah.  Do you remember your Big and Stupid song?  Yeah, it goes, everybody knows Clubby's Big and Stupid.  Here he comes, he's Big and Stupid.  Watch Clubby skip by because he's Big and Stupid.  It goes something like that. 
[02:16:00]  Something like that.  I don't think you called yourself Clubby, though.  I think now he got really Hollywood in the last week.  Clubby?  Ever since his HBO, Kenny is changing.  Now he's Clubby.  And Club Soda Kenny as Clubby.  Clubby.  In the little quotation marks.  That's right.  He comes out dressed as one of Dudley Moore's feet.  I want to call him Golden Buns.  Oh, that name's taken.  Oh, yeah.  That's to be Tom.  I'm sorry.  All right. 
[02:16:30]  Well, Kenny, we're working on your theme music.  Golden Buns beats shitty ass.  Thank you very much for all your support.  Thanks for plugging my show.  Have a nice holiday.  Have a nice couple days off.  And I'll see you when I see you.  All right.  Bye, Kenny.  No, thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you, Kenny.  No, no, no, no.  Let me say something.  Thank you.  Well, let me tell you something.  Thank you.  Okay.  I accept you.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  We'll see you later.  Thank you.  All right.  All right. 
[02:17:00]  Bye.  Thank you.  There he goes.  Club Soda Kenny.  All right.  I don't even know what is on these discs.  We'll just throw it in and see what happens.  What is it?  It's your brother's tribute band.  Oh.  Like a potluck thing.  Yeah.  Which songs?  I don't know.  This is Journey.  Let's hear.  Any way you want it.  That's the way you need it.  Any way you want it.  I was alone.  I never knew what the love would do. 
[02:17:30]  I knew that we'd hurt.  Then we sang.  I love the love of God.  You are my son.  Yeah.  You go.  Unbelievable.  He looks just like Steve Perry, too.  It's amazing.  Hey, when are you two back in Boys Town? 
[02:18:00]  That's unbelievable.  Fantastic.  That's pretty good.  You'll be hearing that at the downtown tonight in Farmingdale with your pals, Opie and Anthony.  Live.  Remember this one?  Trying to get a real big hit.  Get a hit.  How about open arms?  Remember this one?  I don't have a track listing.  We're just guessing.  What about open arms, Opie?  That's your brother.  And he didn't even know how to play Journey.  He told me that he learned this in like a weekend. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, sounds just like him.  Let me get one hit here.  Ralphie May, you're yelling and screaming through the glass there.  He's a busy guy?  You're a busy guy now?  That you're a big TV star?  Shut up.  I want like lights or a hit. 
[02:19:00]  How about open arms?  Something soft.  Couple skate, ladies and gentlemen.  Come on, couple skate.  Yeah.  Shoot the duck if you're out there, baby.  Shoot the duck.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, a little Journey.  Taking you right back.  Oh, yeah.  This is a graduation weekend. 
[02:19:30]  Taking your year.  What was this, 1980 or something?  It was a hot year, baby.  It's unbelievable.  Sounds just like him.  You got to see the guy, what he looks like.  He looks just like Steve Perry did back then.  Amazing.  Wait for the chorus.  Then we'll cut it off.  All right.  Because they got all those Journey harmonies down. 
[02:20:00]  This is a tribute band.  This is a tribute band.  Isn't that amazing?  Really?  It's Ant's brother's band.  Yeah, playing tonight.  These guys are a tribute band for Journey?  I know.  Isn't that sad?  Yikes.  Yikes.  He also has a U2 tribute band.  Wow.  And he's traveling all over the country now.  Actually, he's going to go to Ireland to do the U2 thing. 
[02:20:30]  You have to see the difference in crowds, though.  When you go to the Journey one, it's all these old broads.  Old broads and mullets.  And the old broads are wearing the mullets.  Right.  Which is really scary.  The mullet.  Very rare.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the women wear these stretch pants.  Nice.  And the guys are wearing, like, the parachute pants.  With the zippers on them.  And the white sleeveless shirt with the Chinese letter on it.  And the parking lot is just chock full of rusted out Camaros.  Yeah, baby. 
[02:21:00]  That's it.  You live in the dream.  Burgundy Camaros in the black door.  Yeah, the fucking T-top leaks, but it's hot.  It's fucking cherry, I'm telling you.  That fucking stuck.  I got the Kragers on there.  That exhaust ain't stuck, let me tell you that much.  Remember Capizio shoes?  Fucking awful Dago footwear.  It's so weird to come on a show that you don't have to put the brakes on.  Like, if you feel like dropping a cunt, you can do it easily.  It's so bizarre. 
[02:21:30]  It's like being shackled and, I'm free?  We're finally free.  Yeah, I'm free?  We're free!  Truly the only medium.  Matt's a pal said we're free?  The only medium we could be on.  I can't imagine going on any other regular radio now after this.  We're ruined.  This has ruined us.  The only way you want to do an FCC-friendly show is if you do a free play league or something like that.  Oh, boy.  We'll take that suggestion and not do anything about it. 
[02:22:00]  So we're going to be checking out the bands tonight at the downtown in Farmingdale.  Oh, love needs a fire.  It's kind of a hit.  It's just like Journey.  Where's open arms?  I'm trying to find it.  And the girls, like, hold up lighters.  Oh, they think it's 1982.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  They're all wearing too much makeup for how old they are now.  This is sad.  Yeah. 
[02:22:30]  It's quite a little blast of nostalgia.  Yeah.  I like a good tribute band, though.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, man.  It's a good band.  I did a radio call-in show, and they had a Creed tribute band.  Like, the tribute band for Creed.  Right?  And I was like, you know, I liked Creed's early shit when it was called Pearl Jam.  They fucking suck up there.  They're singing for Jesus.  You're using Jesus to get pussy.  That's kind of like, I don't know.  It just creeps me out a little.  You can't do that. 
[02:23:00]  And can the guy make one video where he's not on the cliff?  And how about buttoning your fucking shirt, you fucking loser?  And they're there, and I'm cracking them.  I don't know them.  They're setting me up, right?  And they go, hey, we're here with the number one Creed tribute band.  I'm like, hey, Greg, go outside and fucking kill yourselves.  You suck.  What are you doing?  You're covering a cover band.  They're fucking a Pearl Jam cover band.  That's all they are.  And they're the guys that actually sued Creed for damage to their career when the lead singer 
[02:23:30]  was getting drunk and passing out on stage.  Hysterical.  That's great.  Well, I have a tribute band to a band that's just out there still and kind of relatively  new, if you think about it.  And shitty.  And shitty.  Yeah.  Well, it could be shitty if it's old shitty.  Because they're a...  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  You know, they're a cover band from...  You could go on these tribute websites that are hysterical.  It's every band that was ever out there.  Every band.  And they try to get those clever little names.  There's like Neil Diamond ones. 
[02:24:00]  America.  Yeah.  Sabra Kadabra is very good.  Sabra Kadabra.  They're the best.  You know what we want to do?  Isn't that an ABBA tribute band?  Jed Zeppelin.  No, they're a Black Sabbath.  There you go.  You know what we want to do?  And maybe we can throw the word out now.  And all those tribute bands that are listening to us right now.  Or if you know of a tribute band, tell them to send the stuff into the radio show.  We want to do Battle of the Tribute Band.  Oh, we'll play it.  Yeah.  And then we'll do a Battle of the Tribute Band.  These guys are all lunatics, too.  Like, some of them, they really think they're the person.  They're kooks.  They live the life like the person. 
[02:24:30]  There's these, you know, Doors tribute bands where the guy walks around thinking he's Jim Morrison.  Yeah.  I'm going to smack him in the head.  Doesn't bathe.  We'll get some kind of contest going.  Could you kill yourself then?  Do the part of it and really complete the whole thing?  Yeah, right.  Oh, you found some YouTube?  Yeah, this is the other band playing tonight.  Well, it's your brother's band, too.  Yeah.  Just a different lineup.  How he goes from a journey tribute band to a YouTube tribute band. 
[02:25:00]  He puts on the Indian headdress and does YMCA.  Oh, man.  He was always my favorite.  The Philippe Rose.  The YouTube band is getting gigs all over the country, though.  These guys are busy every weekend.  Every weekend.  A bunch of drunk Irish want to see this band.  The recording of this isn't as good as the Journey stuff.  But it's good.  The guy's got all the Bono moves. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, no.  It's great.  It looks like him.  It should be a lot of fun.  Tonight at the downtown with your pals in Farmingdale.  I think it starts at what?  Eight?  I'll get down there at eight.  All right.  Cool.  Let's go to this.  Ralphie Mayen's studio playing Caroline's all this weekend.  Yeah, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, two shows on Friday, three on Saturday, one on Thanksgiving,  eight o'clock.  Yeah, you've got to work on Thanksgiving, man.  Oh, it's okay.  Please.  It's all right.  Anything to get away from relatives.  It's phenomenal.  What an excuse.  I mean, I use that excuse why I couldn't come to Thanksgiving lunch. 
[02:26:00]  You know?  At one, I got a show and the traffic and the parade.  I was making up anything.  You just don't like hanging with your family?  Not mine.  It's my girlfriend's family.  Yeah, right?  You've got to do that thing, huh?  Yeah.  What's the problem with the girlfriend family?  They hate me.  Why?  Because I'm not Jewish, I'm fat, and I'm a comic.  Well, you're not as fat as you used to be.  Right.  You've lost a lot of weight.  Right. 
[02:26:30]  Right.  I've lost a ton of weight.  I know.  I've lost a Norton.  Like 220 pounds?  Close.  200 pounds.  I'm not that heavy.  I was giving you the 200.  200.  Jesus.  I just told you, I paid him a compliment.  I go, I go.  If you lost a Norton, you would have lost 165 pounds of mediocrity, which is what I am.  Then I lost that, baby.  I lost that.  But I came in and I go, I go, Jimmy, you don't look as creepy as normal.  What's going on?  Well, he goes, I'm not feeling good. 
[02:27:00]  It's like I'm off my creepiness.  Did you do the stomach staple, right?  Yeah, I did it almost a year ago.  Almost a year ago.  And I had it last year.  It was the day before Thanksgiving.  And the doctor was like, are you sure you want to do this the day before Thanksgiving?  I go, I'm caught up on fucking Thanksgiving.  Trust me.  Wow.  I've done my damage.  Thanksgiving's probably happy that I'm fucking taking this one off.  Yeah.  I did a lot of damage at Thanksgiving.  This year, not so much.  So what can you eat every day?  Do you have that staple?  About a cup full.  That's it?  I went with Voss to Ruby Foods yesterday after watching him do Carolines. 
[02:27:30]  One little Voss handful full of food?  Yeah, right?  A little midget handful of food.  A little non-bending turtle feet hands.  His awful fingers.  His stiff hands for a little man.  He cracks me up.  A little baby feet hands.  He's so funny.  He cracked me up last night.  That's cool.  Hey, you're a sports fan, aren't you?  Yeah, big time.  What's your thoughts on the fight?  We've been talking about the fight for days. 
[02:28:00]  I mean, I've fucking enough already.  What do you expect, okay?  Artest is a fucking thug.  Detroit is a fucking thug town.  All right?  You take this thug to that thug town, and you're shocked when there's a fucking fight.  Are you retarded?  I'm surprised they lasted the whole series last year without a fucking fight.  That's what's shocking.  All right?  And Artest goes to the crowd and beats the shit out of the wrong white dude.  Because, you know, they all look alike, those white guys.  And then there was, like, some black guy just pummeling the shit out of the back of his head. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Awesome.  Fucking great.  I can't get it.  And then that one guy, Artest, like, punches him.  And then, like, he, you know, the guy who just stands up.  And then out of nowhere, bam!  Jermaine drops his ass.  I was like, nice.  The sliding punch.  Nice.  Nice maneuver.  Did you see a kid in the jersey that looked like Robert Kelly, get punched in the face?  Yeah, that's who I'm talking about.  That's who I'm talking about.  Fat idiot, get belted right in his mouth.  Didn't he?  Robert Kelly. 
[02:29:00]  I lost respect for Robert Kelly when he told me he shaves his taint.  I'm like, really?  Really?  Yeah, it's just, uh.  What?  Yeah, right?  See, I'm glad I'm not the only one who lost respect.  Why would you shave his whole sack and everything?  I guess.  I don't know.  He told me he shaves his taint.  There's only two types of people that do that.  The porn star and the gay man.  No, no, I'll tell you.  Maybe Bob can tell this story better than all, but I'll tell it anyway real quick.  There was a time he was getting his ass eaten, and he told me about this.  And he must have had a little piece of toilet paper in there. 
[02:29:30]  This is completely true.  And because he heard the girl, like, when she was eating his ass, go.  That's probably why he shaves his taint.  All right.  That filthy Dominican.  Oh, God.  It is.  There's nothing back there.  Like, you can't assume that if she's doing that and you hear that sound that she's choking  on a Jolly Rancher.  Yeah, right?  You know, you really got to assume it's something that was on you.  That's just a dirty, dirty woman.  Yes.  That's a dirty woman that did it, and, uh.  She doesn't have some jaw that she's trying to get into the spittoon. 
[02:30:00]  I got to be honest with you.  The New York comics are way more depraved than the L.A. comics, and I respect them for that.  You know?  I just respect them.  You're right about that.  The New York comics are really disturbed.  They're really, really odd.  You know, present company included.  Yeah.  Oh, we know about him.  Yeah.  I mean, he's the king.  Yeah.  Ugh.  I sit back and write notes.  I was like, wow.  I think it's honestly that a lot of guys in L.A.  A lot of guys in L.A.  I'm sure are funny guys come from New York, but I think a lot of them are just because  the industry is so prevalent out there, you can't do a set without worrying that somebody's 
[02:30:30]  in the audience.  So it kind of, I think, it cuts down on creativity.  People are so afraid of bombing in front of the head of Fox or whoever might show up.  Or ruin your whole career.  I do this every night for the last eight years.  No one's ever seen me in there.  It's fine.  It's what I want.  It's where I want to work out.  Yeah.  Best club in New York and there's never industry in there.  I think it's the best club in the country, to be honest with you.  It's my favorite.  The low ceilings and the tight crowds.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Let's say hi to Jason in Toledo, Ohio.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What girl wants to wow?  Hi.  What's that? 
[02:31:00]  Wait, this girl wants to wow?  Wow.  Really?  She's terrific.  Will she come in and do that?  We'd love that.  Jason, hold on a minute.  Holy mackerel.  We've got three really hot girls that have just been sitting, staring at us for the last  hour and a half.  And they're coming into the studio now.  Phenomenal.  They're friends of Ziggy, right?  We work for Ziggy.  You work for Ziggy?  You work for Ziggy?  What do you guys do for Ziggy?  We work at my radio store.  My radio store?  Yeah.  Holy mackerel.  You're Ziggy's girlfriend, right?  No, that would be her.  Oh, you're Ziggy's girlfriend. 
[02:31:30]  I'm sorry.  Okay.  That's Aunt Angela.  So, Norton, she's off limits.  I know.  That's why I had to ask, because I've been leering at all of them, and I feel guilty.  I apologize.  Hey, where did the top of your pants go?  They seem to have lost the top of your pants, these kids.  I paid more so they'd cut it off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'd like to let those type of changes.  You know you sound like, remember, Injustice for All, the old guy whose wife got mugged?  Like, this is a punishment?  Probation?  He just wanted her money.  She wouldn't let go of her purse.  So, what do you guys do for Ziggy? 
[02:32:00]  We all work at my radio store in Brooklyn, and we're actually having a sticker stop there  in a couple weeks, so please stop on by.  All right.  We'll have the info up on opiananthony.com.  In Brooklyn, huh?  Yeah.  How do you like that trip in on the Gowanus?  Isn't that fun of fucking traffic?  I'm so glad I moved out to Long Island.  In the nice community I live in now.  Oh, yeah.  Now all the cameras come in.  You see this, Ralphie?  Yeah, right?  Can you blame them?  Now they come in here.  Jesus. 
[02:32:30]  Creepy little stand.  Hey, don't they know I'm a C celebrity?  Maybe a D celebrity?  Come on.  Now you're at least a B- now.  Really?  Yeah, I think so.  Turn up on network TV on a couple of different shows, you're pretty much in.  Is that you underwater on that one show?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I got to call you out on that.  Horrific.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What show?  When you jump in the pool, they have an underwater cam of Ralphie jumping in the pool.  No one looks good underwater.  No, I didn't want to be, I didn't want to be, I didn't have no control over that.  What was that show?  It's called Celebrity Fit Club.  It starts in January.  It's fat celebrities lose weight. 
[02:33:00]  Right.  But they show you underwater.  I'm not even talking about the fat.  It's just something with water.  Cage goes in the water.  Ralphie Mae's in the water.  Oh, Ralphie Mae.  Farewell and adieu to your fair Spanish lady.  Saw Ralphie Mae eat a rocking chair once.  I don't want to staple Ralphie's stomach and have that Kintner voice.  All over the operating table.  It's definitely an unflattering piece of video of you.  Well, you know, I'm there to lose weight, so they're paying me a lot of money to do it.  So, yeah. 
[02:33:30]  Ralphie Mae can't stay down with three barrels in them, not three.  We're going to need a bigger stage.  Wait till the tactical any man sees what I've rung him.  This is the best, man.  The girl wants to wow him.  I understand.  Yeah, but he's on a roll.  These are actually great fat jokes.  I'm really disappointed in most other fat jokes.  This is phenomenal.  When Ralphie Mae's eyes roll back, white, lifeless eyes, like a dog's eyes. 
[02:34:00]  Let's drink to your staples.  He looks at the buffet, tears it to pieces.  Man comes by, tries to clear the buffet, says time's over, but Ralphie Mae keeps coming back and just pounding and pounding.  Sometimes he goes away.  Sometimes Ralphie doesn't go away.  Oh boy, he's here for his noon feeding. 
[02:34:30]  Saw roast beef on the buffet once.  Went to poke at it to get a piece.  It just bobbed upside down.  Ralphie Mae had bit it in half.  I'll never order the buffet again.  It's a buffet Indianapolis.  Sorry.  Yeah.  All right, wowing.  Yeah.  Wow, these girls are beautiful.  What's your name? 
[02:35:00]  Anna.  Wow, I think you girls take care of yourself.  They sure do, Anthony.  Do they work out or something?  Three beautiful brunettes.  Do they have a workout in the morning before we begin stocking the shelves?  Phenomenal.  How tall are you?  Look at the abs.  5'6".  Got the abs working.  The low riding jeans.  And move your hands.  Wow.  Very nice.  Brave old.  Bravo.  Really, really top notch.  Top notch.  Top notch.  Top notch.  Lovely. 
[02:35:30]  We'll have that up on OPNS.  Yeah.  Look at Steve.  You betcha.  I gotta be honest.  What?  He's got an all over his hand.  I know great tits.  I've got a pair.  Those are phenomenal tits.  They really are.  She knows it, too.  She's not shy about it.  I would have loved to have seen more, but, you know, Eric's arm is more important.  Eric would like to see.  I've been staring at Eric's arm the whole time.  How old are you?  30.  You're 30.  Wow.  You're out of your mind.  Really? 
[02:36:00]  Wow.  You obviously don't look 30.  Your boyfriend must love those.  Great way to figure that one out, Jim.  Back door to us.  Your boyfriend slash husband must love those.  Oh, they're fantastic.  She said she's single.  What?  She's single.  She is single?  Ooh.  That just changes the whole perspective on the show.  By the way, folks, I'm at Caroline's through this awkward silence this weekend.  I know.  We're all like, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. 
[02:36:30]  Never?  Well, everyone gets a mild flow.  Never married?  Never married.  What's the problem there?  She likes girls.  Is that it?  No.  There's got to be an issue that you're 32 and you're not married.  Usually, it either means the girl really is into her career or she's a cunt.  No, I'm not saying you are.  I'm just speculating.  Thank you for the big cock block.  That's for the buzzkill.  I'm in no danger.  I hate that word.  Why else are girls that age and not married? 
[02:37:00]  Isn't there supposed to be an alert before that word?  Yeah, I know.  I went right in there without the C-word alert.  Where's the C-word alert?  I'll vouch for her, fella.  She's not a tedious bitch.  She's cool.  Oh, okay.  All right.  All right.  You know, just in case it comes out again.  All right.  What?  Oh, okay.  All right.  Warning.  Warning.  C-word alert.  C-word alert.  Back down the hatches.  Warning.  All right, so now the ladies know that the C-word might fly during the rest of the segment.  I'm not going to say it again.  I'm just saying that a lot of times if a girl...  Did you hear what he called you? 
[02:37:30]  No, I didn't.  I said if a girl was that age, it means now you must be maybe career-oriented.  I just keep meeting the wrong guys.  The wrong guys.  Where are you looking?  Brooklyn?  No.  There you go.  You Russian?  No, I'm Greek.  Greek.  This is beautiful.  Absolutely beautiful.  Do you speak Greek?  Yes, I do.  Can we hear something?  Steve, we can use it for a promo.  That's a little joke.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Can you say something?  Can you say something sexy in Greek? 
[02:38:00]  Dude, what's that?  Can you not cover your nipples, please?  It's the hair that's covering it, which is making it very sexy.  Hey, Jim, what's that liquid you're dumping in the white hanky?  I don't know what to say, guys.  It's too much pressure.  No, you can say anything.  We don't...  Ask Jimmy if he wants to play Monster Rain in Greek.  No, it wouldn't translate well.  It wouldn't translate well.  Us, say, we Greeks like doing it in the ass.  No? 
[02:38:30]  That's the stereotype or the rumor.  Yeah.  Rumor has it.  Just say anything.  Go ahead.  How about, no, I would not like to go out to dinner with you, because that's what I'm  going to wind up hearing anyway.  I'd like to hear it in Greek first, for my pathetic attempt at hitting on you later.  Oh, if you're hungry, you can eat.  You are the worst.  I'm a little nothing.  I saw you working at that blonde yesterday.  You're terrible.  I mean, I live here.  Do you want to come in for coffee?  You turn into a different person. 
[02:39:00]  It's hilarious.  I got it.  Same mashed potatoes, too early.  Piece and carrots, too early.  Anything.  God, I'm just, anything.  I can't even.  How about, I'm really hungry.  Be now.  Hmm?  Be now.  Be now?  Mm-hmm.  That's it?  Yeah, that's it.  That's all we get?  The Greeks cut to the point, those Harry Captain savages.  Be now!  All right, here.  Can you say, um, what do you do with Emo?  Huh?  Wait, she speaks it, too?  Yeah, she speaks it. 
[02:39:30]  So then you do it.  Sisters.  You guys are sisters?  Yeah.  Wow, how is that?  Are your kids as great as hers?  I mean, no offense, but I mean, those are phenomenal.  That's like, not every day.  Did you take my shirt, too?  I mean, on disrespect, I'm just saying.  Could you take your shirt off, too, and then just start kissing your sister?  What did I say?  What happened?  You promised I could jerk off on his face!  I've been waiting for that for a while, it hasn't happened yet.  No?  We're Greek, but that's the men, as I hear us.  Yeah, yeah.  See?  The men like that.  And how old are you? 
[02:40:00]  Wait a minute, isn't Lesbos an island in the group?  Lesbos?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  We traveled to Lesbos!  Lesbos!  Lesbos!  All right, say something for us.  Say something sexy.  Either one.  I had it, and then I lost it, so...  Say, get your cock out!  Can you do that?  I think you just did it for us.  Just say hello, we'll interpret it as that.  Yeah.  Wow.  Give me a line, I'll say it.  I mean, since I'm sure...  All right.  Get your cock out.  This bitch going nowhere, ladies and gentlemen. 
[02:40:30]  I know.  Wow, the people get nervous on me.  Yeah, well, it doesn't translate.  Wow.  The tits are phenomenal, but...  How about...  Say, Ralphie's got the best tits I've ever seen.  Can you say that?  O Ralphie έχει τα καλύτερα βυζιά που έχουμε δει.  Right.  Right on.  Say that again.  Hey, all right.  Now I'm from...  O Ralphie έχει τα καλύτερα βυζιά που έχουμε δει.  Nice.  Wow.  They have sexy voices.  We need them in a promo.  You'll be following Steve in a few minutes.  Thank you, Flower.  Don't worry, he's harmless.  He looks scary, but he won't touch you.  We had a little talk with him behind the scenes, and he won't be touching any girls anymore. 
[02:41:00]  No, I'm just kidding.  That's a joke.  No, I just need you to open your taint.  Right.  It's for a promo.  Right.  What does that have to do with anything?  Trust me.  I just need to brand your ass with the Foundry Music logo.  It's just everything is property of Foundry.  See, this is the problem with our radio show.  The hotter the boobs, the worse the radio gets, because we just get dumbfounded.  Right, exactly.  I would just like to tell the listeners that Eric, when she came in, moved the mic down 
[02:41:30]  to her boobs as though they were going to talk.  That's all right, Eric.  That's what we're trying to think at times.  You know what?  We're stupid.  You're a good man, Eric.  All right.  Well, I hate to say it, but we've got to get the ladies out, because we need to do good  radio for our listeners.  It kills me to say that.  Thank you so very much.  I can't talk with them.  Thank you, gentlemen.  But if you guys want to hang out topless outside, they're going to be awesome.  Give us a traditional Greek farewell.  Yeses.  Yeah?  Yeses.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We could go eat or something.  There's two hotter chicks waiting outside, a lady named Di. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  The retard Laverne, Shirley.  Oh, wait, wait.  Phenomenal.  Absolutely phenomenal body.  Completely nailed it.  Phenomenal.  Absolutely phenomenal.  She's fantastic.  Beautiful.  I have no shot at dinner with her.  I have such a depression.  Perfect body.  Dark hair, dark eyes, small boobs.  Beautiful.  Perfect shape boobs.  But great, yeah.  Phenomenal.  We've said it on the show a million times.  It's not all about the big boobs.  Not at all.  No.  Poe's working on it. 
[02:42:30]  I can't compete with him.  Talking there with his towel.  All right.  We'll have that up on opianthony.com.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Master Poe is working his moves on her.  Look at him.  Look at him.  He's got the towel around him.  I mean, what's his real name?  Master Poe.  Nobody knows?  No.  He's a trained killer.  That's what I've heard.  He really is.  Yeah, so I don't want to give him any static.  Ben, what's Master Poe doing out there?  Look at him with the towel around his neck.  He looks like he just got done beating someone up.  What is he doing?  He's working him.  Can you blame him?  He is totally working the picture. 
[02:43:00]  I can't compete with that.  He's newly divorced.  His great jawline.  He's ready to go.  Very handsome fella.  There's also a problem with...  Well, there's a problem with your mic because people aren't paying attention today again.  Who's mic?  Is your mic on now?  No, it's on.  All right.  Marion caused a disturbance outside.  They were just yelling and screaming, so I think...  What's going on, Master Poe?  Master Poe, are you working?  Are you losing control out there, Master Poe?  No, actually, I'm not.  Just give me one second.  Well, you can have all the time you want.  I'm not going to talk to you.  Play his music again while he gets his headphones.  I don't think music is fine.  What happened is I heard that they were yelling at the intern, at Dan. 
[02:43:30]  Danny.  Danny.  I went outside and I told him, I said, look, you'll have to wait out here.  When I have the time to bring you in, I will.  But in the meantime, just be patient.  Don't yell, don't scream.  Patience they have none of.  Don't yell, don't scream, and do not harass anyone here.  You could take out their voice boxes, right?  In like a second?  Pretty much.  It's pretty easy.  He woke up a comatose guy yesterday with a couple drops to the ear.  I know.  Mr. Miyagi taught him that. 
[02:44:00]  A couple water drops to the ear.  Woke that guy up.  That was amazing.  I've seen him catch a fly with chopsticks.  He's getting on the table.  Well, there's certain parts of your body there.  And what were you saying to the hot Greek women after they left?  Yeah.  Were you working it?  No.  Were you working it?  You're newly divorced.  No, actually.  There are fringe benefits with this radio show.  Yeah, there are many French benefits.  Yeah.  Did I say French benefits?  Did I really say that?  French benefits.  Oh, man.  I really need to sleep for the next three days.  She was very nervous.  I love her.  She was extremely nervous. 
[02:44:30]  And I told her, I said, I would stay by you if that makes me more comfortable.  Yeah.  That's exactly what you say to the fat chicks that come by, too.  Yeah, I never saw you standing by anyone over 130.  I'm sure 190-pound girls get nervous.  I'm sure Lady Di's very nervous.  Why don't you go, you know, comfort her, too?  Lady Di looks like she shaved her face.  She has a 5 o'clock shadow on half of her awful face.  Like thread Flintstone?  Just got that perma shadow?  Dude, it's just awful.  Yeah.  All right.  What's with the towel, Master Poe?  That's the last question for you today. 
[02:45:00]  You really want to know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  What happened now?  No, nothing.  Can it be used as a weapon in the locker room?  This story doesn't end with another bloody gee in a dumpster, does it?  No.  All right, good.  Now, this kid, this is, uh, this could be used as a weapon.  The towel.  Could you demonstrate on Ralphie?  No.  Hey, fuck that.  We're going to bump on a comedy show.  Could you demonstrate on Ralphie?  You can use the towel as a weapon.  An ordinary towel.  If you ask Marcelino to come in, because honestly, anyone that demonstrates with me, 
[02:45:30]  they'll get hurt.  All right.  I want to see how he can use a towel.  Yeah, why not?  An ordinary towel as a weapon.  This is better than taking a stupid commercial break.  Get him in here.  Does he mind it?  I've got to be honest with you.  When I was, uh, like, 13, 14, 15, I had a ceramic towel that, uh, honestly could do  a lot of damage from, uh, all those batches.  You know, I had a ceramic sock and ceramic closet.  It stands up by itself in the corner.  It could be used as a biological weapon.  The towel was pregnant.  I had the whack-off sock under my bed. 
[02:46:00]  Oh.  Oh, yeah, the real stiff one?  Oh, yeah.  Like a croquet mallet?  All right, so what's going to happen here?  We got, uh, Steve from OPNAnthony.com.  He's going to film this demonstration.  What is that stick you have that thing on?  That's really...  That's a monopod.  It's a monopod.  I never heard of it.  It steadies the camera without the, uh...  Oh, okay.  Exactly.  Cool.  So you can lower the thing down and rest it on one little foot.  All right.  Hence, mono.  Mono.  Ah, as in one.  Right.  Very good.  Good thing you only have...  Let it go.  It would have bombed.  It would have bombed. 
[02:46:30]  I was trying to say, too, but you don't have one nucleosis.  And that was why...  Oh, really bad.  That was why I dropped it.  Yeah.  Good.  Anthony.  Good drop.  We got a guy warming up in the studio in the corner there.  What's his name again?  Here we go.  Masolino.  He's only been working for us for eight weeks.  Now, listen...  That's one of those names.  Does he mind doing these demonstrations?  No.  He gets hurt every time you do it, though.  Once again, if anyone else does a demonstration with me, they will get hurt.  But he kind of knows.  He will not get hurt because he's been trained.  You're going to show us how an ordinary bath towel can be used as a weapon.  Before I do that, just forgive me. 
[02:47:00]  I need to warm up, and it'll take a couple of seconds, and then I'll show you what's out.  All right.  You can take the headphones off.  Give Ralphie Mae the mic back.  Ralphie, this is the real deal.  Yeah, this guy's like a killer.  No, he really is.  He's a trained killer.  He's like, you know, the guy's...  That is very spooky.  Just go, you know?  All right.  I will attack Masolino.  Masolino will defend.  All right.  He will defend.  Okay.  I am way too fat and way too close to this crap.  When does the towel come in?  I'm going to go over here where the guy who's got his hand.  That's how you stop up the blood.  Here they go. 
[02:47:30]  All right.  And, of course, we're filming this.  I'm going with you, Ope.  No problem.  All right, Anthony.  He's going to attack Masolino.  All right.  There.  All right.  He's attacking Master Poe.  Oh, my God.  That just looks so freaking horrific.  They're just kind of...  I don't know what they're doing, Anthony.  It looks like they're swatting flies.  I'm not really sure.  It's like a...  You know, if you walked in between that, you would just be, like, on the floor in a second.  Yeah.  All right.  That was pretty impressive.  Hey, guys.  Break it up.  All right.  Now what are we doing? 
[02:48:00]  Poe?  Oh, that's right.  He loses all reality.  All right.  Here comes the towel.  All right.  Let's see how he uses the towel as a weapon.  Oh, Ralphie May, I'm not even kidding.  Master Poe is in another place now.  Yeah.  We won't even be able to talk to him after this is done.  He's in a whole other world.  I'm dead serious.  Look at his eyes.  He's somewhere else now.  Why do you have this much security?  This guy's...  I don't know.  XM isn't telling us something because they hired him to protect us full time.  That's all I know.  All right.  That's all I know.  Here we go.  Towel.  All right.  Oh!  Oh!  Okay.  Okay.  He choked him out with the towel. 
[02:48:30]  Yep.  He's down and out.  Okay.  That's good.  Tap out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't want to...  See, unless you tap out, Master Poe will continue until you are dead.  Yeah.  Just get a good choking.  Yeah.  All right.  So now he's holding the towel in front of him.  Oh, he tied his arm up and now...  Wow!  He's got his arm and his neck with the towel.  All right, all right!  He's immobilized him and now he's crushing his head.  Wait, he just picked up an improvised weapon and he's got it to his neck.  All right.  Unbelievable.  This would be great if it was TV.  Very impressive once again. 
[02:49:00]  He tied up his arm and his head with the towel, immobilizing him.  And then worked on the back of his head with his elbow.  Master Poe, thank you.  Thank you.  All right, get him out of the studio.  Get him out of the studio.  Wow.  Because he doesn't know where he is.  Thank you.  Man.  How do I follow...  The whole time when that was going, I was thinking, rising up back on the street.  How do I top that when I asked the chick out?  She saw a man doing what men do.  I know what men do.  Did you hear my one-liner about Jaws?  Where are you going?  Oh, I think I'm like, nothing.  All right.  Once again, losing it to the athletic guy. 
[02:49:30]  Why don't we take a break?  I think the retard of Laverne and Shirley will be joining the party next.  I hope.  We're just kind of screwing up.  From hot tits to...  That's the problem with this show.  Can I give out something for Ralphie, though?  The number for Caroline's?  Oh, yeah.  212-757-4100.  Ralphie Mae, I saw you last time you were at Caroline's.  Maybe you've been there since.  No, no, no.  I went underground for a long time.  Absolutely hilarious.  Underground.  Absolutely hilarious.  And the shows will sell out, so call.  I'm not just being polite.  They will sell out.  Yeah, Ralphie Mae at Caroline's all weekend long, starting tomorrow?  Yeah, it's Thursday, 8 o'clock, 2 on Friday, 3 on Saturday. 
[02:50:00]  There you go.  Call 212-757-4100 for your reservations.  Yes, Ben.  There's two more chicks here, too.  Oh.  Hot chicks.  Hot chicks?  Hot chicks?  Hotter than the Greek chicks?  They're hot as well.  The Greek sisters are phenomenal.  I want the Greek girl to go out with me.  I'm so depressed over whatever.  Her tits were absolutely fabulous.  I'll ask her for you.  Little quarters.  I can't have that.  Little quarters, perky nipples.  No, they were beautiful.  They were perfect.  They were beautiful.  I would do this with them. 
[02:50:30]  You're going to ask the father to take a hand in marriage?  I don't know any girl like that.  I know.  Wrong nationality.  No.  Same machismo drivel.  No drivel, according to the guy that hates me.  Same drivel.  All right, listen.  We should take a break.  I got the Jimmy Robinson song, Anthony.  Oh, I love the Jimmy Robinson song.  We need to set it up, though.  The problem with people joining the program every day, we've got to set these things up a lot.  Jimmy, besides Monster Rain, which was a little game he played with little playmates, he would 
[02:51:00]  yell, Monster Rain's coming.  They would run under a porch and give each other oral treats.  Perfect.  Besides that, Jimmy had a lot of imaginary play friends when he was a little pot.  And one was Jimmy Robinson, who was Jimmy with a cape.  He was like a superhero.  And Jimmy here and Jimmy Robinson hated Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, Jimmy Robinson and I hated Jimmy Norton.  Don't ask.  It doesn't make any sense.  And who did Kiss hate in this scenario?  Kiss didn't hate anyone, but they would just come over, and all four of them in makeup,  but especially Gene and Paul, would beat me and they would hurt me. 
[02:51:30]  And I remember kicking me down the stairs and then just hugging me and loving me and comforting me.  But who?  That was my fantasy.  All right.  Oh, fantasy.  Okay, I'm like...  They did this to you?  I love it.  Yes.  Or the other guy or Jimmy Robinson.  And who is the other guy that's not Jimmy Norton that is Jimmy Norton?  No, no, me.  I would almost observe Jimmy Robinson with the cape and Jimmy Norton, but it was me.  I would kind of dissociate myself.  It was me and Jimmy Robinson hating Jimmy Norton.  This is going to take another two weeks, and we'll have it all figured out. 
[02:52:00]  I love it.  And then there's Helen.  Wow.  Helen.  Holy S.  Who are they?  Holy shit.  This show just got better.  Wow.  Now we got hot orientals.  We got sluts.  Nice.  Hero.  Oh.  They got to be pros, though.  They couldn't just be...  You think they're pros?  They don't dress like that unless they're pros.  You know what?  I got to say it again.  I say it a lot on this show.  That DNA's a bitch, because you mix up the DNA, and you get that, and then you mix up  the DNA another way, and look over there. 
[02:52:30]  Ricardo, Laverne, and Shirley.  Proven God definitely has a sense of humor.  What's going on with these girls, Eric?  Yeah, who are they?  They'll be coming in a little bit later, through with this bandwolf pack.  They're going to be doing the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Are you kidding?  Breaking in the couch, and...  Whiffle Ball.  What?  What?  Ralphie, you got to go.  I'm sorry.  No, fuck that.  Fuck that.  Fuck that.  Fuck that.  I'm really sorry you got to go.  I can't believe you told us you had to be out here by nine.  I never told you that.  This is awesome. 
[02:53:00]  This show just got better and better.  And I got the mic close to the couch.  Yeah!  I think you got to go.  I'm going to smell that sweet boy.  This is not a big studio.  We need some room.  I think we have to tell you.  I think...  Eric, get him out of the studio.  Why do all the fucking chicks come in here and they're in a band?  I hate being a comedian.  It's kind of fucking awful.  And his towels are going to have to come in and drag my fat ass out of here.  I think he's got to go, man.  What do you think?  Choke me out.  I'm staying here.  He was.  He was pointing at his watch.  He did point out.  I was like, Jesus, I'm out here with the... 
[02:53:30]  By the way, I filled out way too much paperwork.  I know.  To do this, okay.  I did XM.  I did like a two-hour interview with them in D.C.  They made me feel out of nothing.  He won't leave.  Oh, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  We're just kidding.  Look at him.  I know.  He's like, oh, this is going to be a challenge.  You choke me out.  You got to carry me.  That's the rule.  You got to drag my fat ass out.  You take pleasure in it.  All right.  That's my only weapon.  It's my fatness.  Thank God.  Thank God.  No, no. 
[02:54:00]  He's staying.  He's staying.  Because Master Poe still doesn't know when we're kidding.  I know.  He would be really rough.  Calm down, Master Poe.  It's okay.  I was kidding.  Can't you tell I'm kidding?  You got a problem?  I like the sensei in, uh, uh, just say Cobra Kai.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  You can stay.  Yes, sensei.  Didn't you get the music?  That's from Karate Kid.  Oh, I did not.  Yeah, that's what his music is, because he's sensei.  Oh, okay.  Go away to get the joke, Ralphie.  Thanks.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I picked the music out myself. 
[02:54:30]  I, man, I avoid all that.  This is the show that I avoid all that.  I smoke a lot of weed.  This is the show where guests don't want to leave.  Are you out of your mind?  You've got, okay, you just had hot Greek brats, okay?  All right.  How about this?  If you can sit through the retarded Laverne Shirley, we'll let you stay for those two  hot pieces of asses.  I can sit through.  That's a good deal.  And I think we're going to get the Greek girls involved somehow.  Holy S.  There's a red marking machine.  And they have fired up the Jägermeister machine.  All is good.  Oh, you can hear it humming.  With the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  So getting back to Jimmy Robinson.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:55:00]  Then there's Helen.  Helen is another imaginary friend he had when he was a kid.  She was, um, one of my imaginary friends when I was about seven or eight was a woman  in her late 30s, probably 37, with a beehive frosted hairdo named Helen.  And she was one of my playmates.  My, like, imaginary friends.  Picture any woman's picture from, like, 1967, 68.  Where they kind of look over the shoulder and there's, like, an oval, like, light around  them.  Like, that's...  That vibe.  That's...  I know exactly what you're talking about.  Or, like, the baby blue polyester short skirt.  Well, black and white... 
[02:55:30]  I'm picturing a black and white photo with a beehive frosted hairdo.  And that was Helen.  Nice.  Helen.  All right.  So it all comes together in this song by Fuel.  A great song by Fuel.  The lyrics, uh...  They, yeah, hit every one of these subjects.  All right.
