<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment focused on their former colleague, Scorch, a radio personality from Boston.  The hosts, alongside Sam Roberts (a former intern for both Opie & Anthony and Scorch), dissected Scorch's bizarre radio segments, including "Wheel of Meat," "Douche or Dressing," "Top Ten Gyms," "Brain Cell Stimulator," and "Color of the Day."  They played audio clips from Scorch's rival, Pauly (formerly Scorch's sidekick), who now worked at a Syracuse station, K-Rock, detailing his negative experiences with Scorch, including accusations of backstabbing and poor communication regarding job opportunities.  The hosts also discussed Scorch's online presence, self-promotion tactics, his "Paws for a Cause" event, and his catchphrase, "Lookie, lookie, Miss Cookie."  The conversation was laced with explicit descriptions, crude jokes, and offensive language throughout.  This segment included a replay of a previous phone call with Scorch, featuring in-studio "Oompa Loompas" (described as "original Willy Wonka midgets") and a caller named Steve from Yellowstone, both contributing to the already highly profane conversation.  Scorch was repeatedly characterized as a "hustler," but also somewhat endearing.  The call showcased Scorchâ€™s frequent lying about being live on air while taping segments.  The discussion then transitioned to A.J. Clemente, a news anchor fired for cursing on air ("gay fucking shit"), with the hosts playing the clip and discussing the fallout. The segment concluded with observations about people at their gym and a viral video of a cat in a shark costume riding a Roomba, followed by brief comments on the Boston Marathon bombing suspects and the Associated Press Twitter hack.

The show continued with a weather report, followed by a vulgar discussion about Mika Brzezinski from *Morning Joe*.  The hosts then criticized a Twitter user ("Sax God") for his perceived defense of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects.  This led into an interview with A.J. Clemente, who detailed the technical difficulties leading to his on-air blunder and the subsequent media frenzy.  The hosts shared their own on-air mishap experiences, referencing Tom Brokaw's past mistakes.  Clips from a Jim Norton Comedy Central segment on offensive humor about bullying were played.  Following this, UFC fighter Chael Sonnen joined the studio.

The interview with Chael Sonnen covered a wide range of topics, beginning with his upcoming fight against Jon Jones, training regime, and weight-cutting methods (which involved significant fluid loss and rapid rehydration).  The conversation quickly devolved into highly explicit and sexually charged discussions about female body hair and other vulgar topics, with both the hosts and Sonnen contributing freely.  Sonnen discussed his relationship with Dana White, his coaching career (including his Ultimate Fighter team's success), and his own sleep problems.  The conversation shifted back to fighting, including Sonnen's coaching style, the ethics of fighting an incapacitated opponent, and the legalization of UFC in New York.  Sonnen performed some self-defense moves on one of the hosts.  The show concluded with a discussion about Snoop Dogg/Snoop Lion's music career, more crude jokes, and promotions for their other projects and the upcoming Jim Norton advice show.  The entire broadcast was punctuated by frequent use of offensive language and crude humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Gregorio!  Antonio!  Eee me.  Hey yo, what's up out there?  Thank you!  How did I see?  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If you're not going to find this offensive, just don't listen.  But my guess is, you'll be sticking around.  Let's do this.  It's going down, Jack. 
[00:00:30]  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show  right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and then gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted.  I'm telling you, who's enjoying this shit? 
[00:01:00]  That's what you like, isn't it?  Amphemy.  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Good morning. 
[00:01:30]  Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We gotta do it.  Fuck it.  Good morning, everyone.  Hi.  Sam just handed us some audio.  I think we're gonna go right for it.  Yes.  Our old pal, Scorch.  Scorch.  Who doesn't love the Scorch?  Have you heard from Scorch?  No, I'm kind of...  You haven't heard from him since you backstabbed him? 
[00:02:00]  Oh.  He's left some messages on his Facebook page.  I've been avoiding him because I feel bad.  I feel guilty.  Why do you feel bad?  He has no idea what this is.  I don't know.  He loves the attention.  He's been getting a lot of YouTube comments and Facebook comments and Twitter messages.  I follow him on the Facebook now.  You follow him on the Facebook?  Oh, hells yeah.  And?  Who wouldn't?  Yeah.  A lot of self-promotion.  A lot of self-promotion.  Well, when you're in this business, you gotta do some self-promotion because no one else 
[00:02:30]  is gonna do it for you.  So you gotta do it all yourself.  Do it yourself.  He does a thing.  But everything's gotta be a thing.  Like I was noticing on his Twitter yesterday.  Right.  Well, I just gotta say, because the listeners come and go and we got newer listeners.  We worked with Scorch up there in the Boston area at WAAF, the only station that really  rocks.  And we've been keeping tabs on him ever since.  Yeah.  Because he's a special, special human being.  He's quite a character.  When we met him, he was doing the Kingdom of Nakedness.  Kingdom of Nakedness. 
[00:03:00]  And when I met him, he was...  Naked Militia.  Naked Militia.  Naked Militia.  He changed it to the Naked Militia.  Yeah, when I was working for him.  Yeah, and he would make believe he was broadcasting naked.  Yeah.  In the nude.  And then he's got this show, PFG TV.  Right.  Which I guess is like a paid infomercial at 3, 2, 3 in the morning, whatever it is, on  Fox Affiliate up there in...  New Hampshire, maybe?  New Hampshire, yeah.  New Hampshire, and it's like a talk show.  It's like The Tonight Show.  Of course it's like The Tonight Show.  He sits down and interviews local celebrities, I guess. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  And, yeah.  Yeah, he's quite a character.  We love him.  The Scorch.  In a strange way, we love him.  I can't explain it.  But you were just on his website, and he's got brand new bits.  Yes.  What were some of the old bits that we talked about on the show in the past?  I mean, they used to do...  Wheel of Meat, of course.  Wheel of Meat.  Wheel of Meat.  Douche or Dressing.  Douche or Dressing.  Wow, that was a good one. 
[00:04:00]  I remember that.  And that bit was like, he'd say, Summer's Eve.  Right.  And then you'd have to call, and is it a douche product, or is it a salad dressing?  Damn, I don't know about that one.  He would say like, you know, like...  Ranch.  Ranch.  Water and vinegar.  Yeah.  That's douche product.  Right.  Oil and vinegar.  Dressing.  Oh, okay.  Now I know how to play.  And you would have to, you know, play along.  The problem is, is you could only do maybe three.  Three.  Tops.  But he did it week after week.  Of course.  How many different douche combinations are there?  There's oil and vinegar, or water and vinegar. 
[00:04:30]  Water and vinegar.  That's it.  That's what we're saying.  Maybe there's some other stuff, like some fucking...  Well, he would use product names.  Oh.  Or some kind of floral smelling thing.  Right.  Some fucking pussy potpourri.  Would he do it once a week for a while?  He did it a lot.  But how many...  That's impossible.  That's impossible.  Just so he could say, douche or drizzy.  Douche or drizzy.  What do you think?  Let's go to the floor.  But to be fair, he came up with...  Well, Scorch, you understand douche or drizzy, right?  Of course, Scorch.  Good idea, buddy.  Of course.  I think it's a benchmark bit for the Scorch show. 
[00:05:00]  Of course.  He came up with a lot of ideas because he told me.  I interned for him.  Yeah, I know.  And then you...  Colin Quinn loves the whole Scorch thing.  Who wouldn't?  He loves the fact that you've stabbed him in the back.  Oh, Sam.  Colin loves that.  I just sat there collecting information and then came and exposed.  Well, the strange thing.  Didn't you start interning for us?  Then you went back up to Syracuse where you were going to college, what, about 10 years  ago at this point?  Almost.  And then while you were up there, you were interning for Scorch. 
[00:05:30]  And then he came back to us.  And got hired here.  With all this inside info.  You were here for...  And then left?  Yeah.  Yeah, I was here and then I interned for Scorch and then I came back here.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I was the one that made the mistake and told Sam to keep in touch after his internship.  You can blame me.  I was the one.  I remember that.  We were clear and...  I'm like a tick sucking the blood as he came back and I was like...  I was free and clear of Sam Roberts, but I was the one that took him aside and said,  you know what?  You should keep in touch with the show.  He came back and I was like...  I was like... 
[00:06:00]  He looks familiar.  What was...  What was his name?  What?  Like you were just another intern that just fucking left.  I could have...  You could have...  You could have had me out of your hair after three months.  Yes.  That was it.  I was gone for...  I mean, I...  Then he came back for like, I don't know, you know...  A week here, a day there.  But I mean, I was gone for nine months.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I went back to school for...  But I was the one.  I was like, you know, you should keep in touch.  That's by popular demand.  Blame me.  It didn't happen.  Anyway, what were some of the other bits? 
[00:06:30]  He did a...  We're missing a couple more fucking benchmark bits.  Yeah, because there was always alliterations or rhymes.  Oh, he loves to rhyme.  You know what he did that really drove Pauly, his sidekick, crazy one day?  He went through this phase where he wanted...  He said he had top ten lists.  Oh, boy.  And he loved to do them, right?  Yeah.  And Scorch said, it's the anniversary of the Jungle Gym, so today we're going to do the 
[00:07:00]  top ten gyms.  Whoa.  People named Jim.  He loved tying things in.  But Pauly was off the air and he's yelling at him going, what do you mean top ten gyms?  Let's do something weird.  Let's go...  I don't know.  He goes, let's get the stunt boy and make him play at a jungle gym and the parents will  think he's weird.  Right, right.  Do something with this and he goes, no, no, we're going to do top ten gyms.  Top ten gyms.  Top ten gyms.  Jim Morrison.  Let me look at my list here.  Yes, Jim Morrison.  Jim Kirk. 
[00:07:30]  We've come to find out it was not the anniversary of the Jungle Gym.  He was just looking for an excuse to do the gym list.  He wanted to do the top ten.  Why did he want to do the gym list so bad?  Because it's Scorch.  That's the beauty of this guy.  He found a list of the top ten people named Jim.  Right.  And he needed a reason to do it.  He said, I've got to do this.  How could I make it sound like I just came up with it because it's tied into something. 
[00:08:00]  Jim, Jim, go to the gym.  Oh, Jim, Jim, jungle gym.  And I was just a kid having a blast watching all this happen.  This is bizarro world.  Of course.  And watching his sidekick, Pauly, sit there and just bite his lip every day.  Pauly didn't really get along with Scorch, right?  No, because he knew, because this was his career.  Yeah, because it's leading to Pauly.  This is why we're talking about Scorch today.  Yeah.  I mean, every time Scorch left the room, Pauly would be yelling about some bit that Scorch... 
[00:08:30]  Is he still on the radio?  ...insisting on doing.  Yeah, he's still in Syracuse doing radio.  Can you go to Scorch's page?  Yeah.  Because I saw new bits.  Look at these new bits.  Well, he also did.  He did the brain cell stimulator.  Oh, that's the one.  Yeah.  Every morning.  Where you think he's talking about a cock and it's a toothbrush?  That type of fucking humor?  Not even that.  It wasn't as good as that one?  Double entendre type stuff?  Nothing.  It would just be like...  Nothing.  Every morning, 70% of people use this with their breakfast. 
[00:09:00]  And then it's like the most open-ended thing.  Right.  And you take four calls.  Right.  And that's like a big day.  And then you go, the answer was a napkin.  There was no way the answer was a napkin ever.  Yes, that would be it.  Then you've got to remember, weird news.  Right.  Yeah.  Which he brought to the TV show.  Some are odd and some deranged stories that are very strange. 
[00:09:30]  Weird news.  Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, weird news coming up.  Weird news.  There was a guy over there in Malden.  And he actually got a flat tire.  And he changed the tire, right?  And then as he's driving away, he didn't put all the lug nuts on.  So the tires started shaking.  But he got to a gas station, tightened the lug nuts up, and then drove home.  Weird news.  Some are odd and some deranged stories that are very strange.  Some are very strange.  Weird news.  And this is different than Jocktober. 
[00:10:00]  Totally different.  I can't explain.  I love Scorch.  But that's it.  What Ant just did is exactly what Scorch would do.  Right.  It's like he would find either a list or like he would find that opener on some website.  And he'd have to play the weird news jingle.  Right.  So he wouldn't have anything for it.  And he would just come up with some story that's not even that weird.  No, no.  It's not very weird.  He'd play the jingle.  He'd love the jingle.  The difference is we're obsessed with the man that is Scorch.  Yeah.  Right.  But in October, like, you know, they shouldn't take it personally. 
[00:10:30]  We don't even care about them.  No.  As human beings.  We just, you know, mock their silly radio show.  But, you know, with Scorch, it's way deeper than that.  And I don't want Scorch to take it personally either.  Oh, please.  He'll never take it personally.  He gets excited when we talk about him.  He treated me very well.  Yeah.  And I enjoyed my time with him very, very much.  Obviously.  Of course.  I don't think he has a bad bone in his body.  No.  I think he's a wonderful man.  He never did or said anything bad about us.  But he is a complete character. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  I mean, he's amazing that this exists.  With that said, what's his new bit I see up there on his website?  It's Scorch's psychotic survey.  Look how he spelled survey.  Well, you know, you got to be a little different.  He put a P in front of it.  It's like psychotic, which, you know, is P-S-Y, psychotic survey.  P-S-U-R-V-E-Y.  Most people, if they had to make it an alliteration, would just drop the P in psychotic and make  it psychotic survey.  But he adds the silent P to survey. 
[00:11:30]  But that's what Scorch would do.  Of course.  Don't you understand?  But this is...  What's the bit?  Why is it psychotic?  It's not!  It's not.  That's the beauty of it.  Because everything has to have some alliteration.  Yeah.  Or so...  It has to have the stamp of Scorch on it.  Right.  When I was telling you about the brain cell stimulator, and it would be as mundane as  70% of people use a napkin.  Yeah.  This is today's psychotic survey.  Yeah.  Have you ever...  Oh, okay.  I see.  Right.  So it's like on his website.  And every day it's a question. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  Every day.  Gotcha.  And then he gets the audience to vote.  Right.  Have you ever had a close encounter with a famous celebrity?  Option one.  All caps.  Yes, I have.  Several exclamation points.  Yeah.  Option two.  All caps.  Nah.  Ellipses.  Never.  Even more exclamation points.  Even more exclamation points.  And then you can vote.  Those are your options.  Those are your options.  And I do like how he puts his name in front of everything and brands it. 
[00:12:30]  It's not just the psychotic survey here.  It's Scorch's.  It's Scorch's psychotic survey.  Let's see a little key.  But who would give a fuck?  Then what?  He goes on the air and goes, well, I got the poll results.  Yes.  Can you vote and see?  Look, can we check out the vote?  Yeah, 28%.  What are you going to vote?  I've never had a close encounter with a celebrity.  Yes, I have.  I'll say yes.  For instance, today.  Well, I think you have had a close encounter with a celebrity, right?  Who today?  I'll have a close encounter with Chael Sonnen later today.  That's a celebrity.  There you go.  All right, so you have to check the...  All right, we'll vote. 
[00:13:00]  Yes, I have.  Can you show the number of people that voted?  Look at this.  56% of the people say, yes, I have.  44% say, nah, never.  How many people is that?  Who gives a fuck?  No numbers, just percentage of people.  I would bet seven people.  Thank God there's no numbers.  God, who cares?  And he does his Facebook thing.  I noticed, because his Twitter is, it's me, Scorch.  Right.  And he sends out Facebook links while he's doing the show.  Right. 
[00:13:30]  And he knows, I guess he's all about social networking now, because his new thing is to  send out a picture, and then he goes, and you know what you gotta do, share the hell  out of it.  Oh, yeah.  So it's not like, give me a share.  Yeah.  It's share, because he's branding it.  Yeah.  Share the hell out of it.  That's what he says, too.  He's like, no matter what you think, just share it.  That's great.  So, with that said.  Right.  Paul. 
[00:14:00]  Oh.  You got something else.  Brain cell stimulator.  He's still doing it.  Oh.  But isn't that psychotic survey?  No.  That's ridiculous.  What is the brain cell stimulator for today?  Well, this was yesterday's, because it's afternoon's now.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Here's today's brain cell stimulator.  On an average day, women do this around 60 times.  Men, around 40 times.  Must be specific, and nothing sexual, or body function related, per se. 
[00:14:30]  Good luck.  There's some, I mean, completely, some of the answers that people are chiming in with.  Some say, change the channel on the TV.  Oh.  Daydream about being on a beach vacationing.  Check Facebook.  But when are we going to find the answer?  Find out the answer.  Yeah, really.  Maybe, I guess you got to tune in for it.  Oh, fuck.  I need to know the answer. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, boy.  What?  This post says, so let me see.  So far in the past 24 hours, I've been majorly insulted by someone I thought was my future,  and I've been majorly ripped apart by people I thought were friends from my past.  Oh, no.  Good thing I live in the present, about an hour away from today's brain cell stimulator.  And he's obviously talking about Paulie, right?  He's talking about Paulie.  Which we have.  This is the only reason we're talking about Scorch today.  So Paulie, his ex-sidekick, went on a competing radio station to talk about Scorch. 
[00:15:30]  Well, this is his not current competing radio station, because now he's in Manch Vegas.  What ended their relationship?  Well, their relationship ended.  I watched it end.  Oh, you did?  Yes, I did.  How long did they work together?  Two years.  Two years.  That's a long time.  Oh, this is that?  Yeah, okay.  And I got to be there for almost the entire last year.  Nice.  And the whole time, Scorch was telling Paulie, don't worry.  Don't send out any demos.  I'm sending out our demo. 
[00:16:00]  It's all good.  You're taken care of.  Uh-huh.  One day, on a Thursday, Scorch called Paulie and said, hey, Paulie, tomorrow's going to  be my last day in Syracuse.  And Paulie said, what?  And Scorch said, yeah, yeah, this weekend I'm moving to New Hampshire.  I'm going to start doing radio there.  And Paulie goes, wait.  But with me or?  No, no, by myself.  But you said, but you said, but you said, but you said, yeah, and then Scorch left, station 
[00:16:30]  flipped, Paulie was unemployed for a while.  Wow.  Did Scorch dislike him, too?  No.  That's the weird part with this Scorch guy.  He doesn't even know what he's doing in here.  Scorch would just think like, yeah, I got a gig.  What's the matter?  Yeah, right.  But I mean, but he didn't even give him any advance notice or anything.  God, you'd think you would give him a heads up.  No.  Fuck.  And then Paulie called me and he was like, look, I don't even know whether to be mad 
[00:17:00]  at this guy or not.  I don't think I have it in me, but we're going to go out and get drunk right now.  Me, Paulie, and Scorch went out bar hopping in Syracuse.  Wow.  The night before his last show.  Really?  Yeah.  Did Paulie stay?  Oh, he stays in radio, right?  Yeah, he's still in Syracuse.  But yeah, he ended up getting another gig in radio.  All right.  So Paulie's doing all right.  He's doing all right now.  But he went on this K-Rock in Syracuse.  Right.  So yeah, that was... 
[00:17:30]  Why did he blast Scorch?  Scorch used to be on K-Rock in Syracuse.  Then he moved to another station called Rock 105.  Right.  But I think that the morning show on K-Rock Syracuse now wanted to tell Scorch stories.  I wouldn't be surprised since we've been doing it so much lately.  Of course.  Yeah, and it's working well for us.  So I think other people are jumping on the Scorch bandwagon.  But they really wanted...  It's great to just tell a Scorch story.  Everyone loves a good Scorch story.  But they really wanted to do Wheel of Meat on their show. 
[00:18:00]  And so they wanted Paulie to come on their show to do Wheel of Meat since he's the expert.  He was the expert at Wheel of Meat?  I mean, you saw it happen.  Right.  Okay.  I did too for the facts.  So here's Paulie on this show in Syracuse.  Says he was Scorch's sidekick and explains...  Oh yeah, he explains color of the day.  I forgot about that bit.  I didn't want to get into that because I didn't want to steal Paulie's thunder.  Right, right.  I forgot Scorch used to do color of the day.  Of course he did every day. 
[00:18:30]  You've run out of colors after five or six.  Well...  We have a few show.  We have a done few show.  Don't forget about Seafo Green.  Did they get that crazy?  Hey guys, color of the day today.  I'm thinking mauve.  Let's go with it.  That's a terrible...  We're taking your mauve stories.  There are only so many primaries.  Oh man, that's going to be a special fucking Sudoku. 
[00:19:00]  That's going to be a valuable Sudoku puzzle.  I hope he just spilled his coffee on it.  That's a terrible fucking...  I spilled my coffee.  What would you guys do for color of the day today?  It stinks.  Well, color of the day.  What would I do?  Probably just say black and then...  Go ahead, Andrew.  Lavender.  It's color innocent.  And then I would go home because one of my jobs as an intern was to write all the fake  emails.  That's right.  The fake emails.  Here's an email coming in. 
[00:19:30]  It's Bob from Marlboro.  Can you talk about Scorch for two hours?  Yes.  Easily, right?  Yes.  It's just amazing.  What do you mean fake emails?  Well, you know, like people on the air will be like, hey, we got emails coming in.  It's because Scorch had a jingle.  That's right.  Oh, he had an email jingle.  He had a jingle and it would go, E, E, email.  Do, do, do, do, do, do.  And so we would have to have emails every day.  He loves a jingle.  But you had to write fake emails about how great he was? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, I would write emails.  Or how good the show was or whatever.  Every day I would write emails and it would have to be, and he wanted, eventually he  started asking me to do it not from Syracuse because he said, we're streaming now.  So do it, you know, from all kinds of different cities.  Worldwide if you want.  I was like, okay.  And so I'd write these emails, but I would always try to sneak in little references that  only his sidekick, Pauly, would get just to make Pauly laugh as Scorch was reading  them on the air.  And Scorch had no idea? 
[00:20:30]  No, yeah, he would pre-read it, you didn't get them.  But he didn't understand the little references you threw in there?  You know, like I'd start, like, what I would do is Scorch would leave the room and Pauly  would be complaining about some bit.  And then I would go home and whatever bit that Pauly was complaining the most about, I  would write an email about how great it was.  But then in Scorch's mind, he would react like that was real listener feedback and that  the listeners were really into this bit.  So he made sure he did that bit a little more.  But I was just going, you know, I was writing them. 
[00:21:00]  I get it.  Believe me, I get it.  All right, so there's your huge long setup, but Pauly ends up on this K-Rock show in Syracuse  and decides to beat the shit out of Scorch.  Yeah, he did.  Pauly was the intern, man.  No.  He wasn't the intern.  What were you for Scorch?  I was his sidekick.  Oh, you were his bitch.  All right, gotcha.  He was the one that did all the Chewy impressions.  He used to do a bit that he's still to this day don't understand. 
[00:21:30]  He would do the color of the day.  The color of the day.  Just randomly at 8.05.  Good morning, Scorch here.  It's 8.05.  The color of the day is blue.  Here's some Guns N' Roses.  There's only so many colors.  I love it.  It's like listening to us.  He's talking about Scorch.  He said that's the guy he did radio.  Right.  That's his sidekick.  Color of the day.  Today's blue. 
[00:22:00]  Here's Cousin Roses.  It's 8.05.  8.05.  It's gorgeous.  That really was the extent of color of the day.  Color of the day.  Just to mention the color.  Did he ever explain why he was doing color of the day?  He refused to explain it.  Pauly would off the air.  Pauly would be screaming.  Why the fuck are we doing color of the day?  It doesn't make any sense.  No, people like it.  It's color of the day.  It's something I start the day with.  It's something that people talk about.  It's like, hey, you get to work listening to Scorch?  Yeah, I was.  Well, hey, did you hear the color of the day? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, it's blue.  Yeah, I heard that too.  Did he just think that made things familiar or comfortable?  Like people would hear that and that was like, hey, part of my Scorch day.  Yeah.  Waking up with Scorch.  You got your color.  You got your brain fucking shit.  You got your...  Did he smoke a lot of pot?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know for sure because you got to be careful with that shit.  I mean, Pauly said that he did.  All right.  And he said it on one of the clips.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's what I'm getting a lot of that information from. 
[00:23:00]  And I'm also getting info that it's that time of year where he goes back into the animal pen to raise awareness.  Paws for the cause.  Paws for the cause.  Paws for the cause.  Look how I spell Paws.  P-A-W-S.  Hold on.  Brandon has info on that.  Brandon in Boston.  Boston Strong.  What's up, Brandon?  Hey.  Yeah, he was the radio guy at a concert I was at this weekend where he introduced all the bands and come out and act like an idiot.  And that was one of the things he brought up is that he's going to spend a week in an animal pen and raise money for the animals. 
[00:23:30]  He does that every year.  Yeah.  Do you know you read Raccoon?  Whoa, look at that.  Thank you, sir.  What happened?  This guy just pulled this guy back from a train.  Another one?  He fucking saved that guy's life right there.  That guy's trying to jump?  Saved his fucking life.  I don't know.  What the fuck?  It might have been.  He's drunk.  He looks drunk.  Wow.  What city is that in?  I don't know.  All right, we'll get more info on that. 
[00:24:00]  Colombia.  Colombia?  Colombia.  That's crazy.  Colombia.  He's probably coked out.  Wait.  What?  He's describing paws for a cause.  Right.  Now, generally, you'd say 24 hours a day for seven days, I'm going to be in an animal pen, right?  Yeah, I got to suffer with the animals.  He writes, every year, I actually live for 23 hours and 50 plus minutes per day in the  cage for an entire work week. 
[00:24:30]  Wait.  What?  So, he's taking weekends off and taking breaks.  Why couldn't he say 24 hours?  Yeah, I'm very, I got to take a piss.  23 hours, 50 plus minutes.  50 plus.  So, he gets out of the cage just to take a leak.  Yeah.  Stretch his legs a little.  Take a little stroll.  Yeah.  And why would I do it the weekends?  I can't do a show.  Got to go to the rock shows.  That's how Scorch makes his pocket money.  Boys.  What is Scorch's PFG approved spank bank?  Today in the bank, it's another tattoos day. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, Tuesday is tattoos day, right?  It's tattoos day.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  You got to have your days of the week thing.  Of course.  Get a girl that people can jerk off to, so you spank bank.  All right.  Pauly talks about old bits he had to do with Scorch.  He used to make me read dating tips.  Oh, no.  On the air, and it was called, Pauly Gitchapoon was perfect.  Pauly Gitchapoon.  Pauly, Pauly Gitchapoon.  Pauly, Pauly Gitchapoon. 
[00:25:30]  He would print out the dating tips for Pauly.  Pauly's no dating expert.  I saw him.  He's terrible with women.  But he would print out the dating tips off, like, whatever prep service, and just hand  him.  He'd go, here's your Pauly Gitchapoon for today.  Here it is.  And Pauly would just be miserable reading this shit.  Wow.  What you could do is, he used to make me read dating tips.  Oh, no.  On the air, and it was called, Pauly Gitchapoon was perfect. 
[00:26:00]  That's a funny line.  I'll give him that.  It was a funny title.  And then I had to do the Hollywood rumors, and it was, hooray for Paulywood.  That's very good.  That's very funny.  I'm feeling the flow.  I'm so upset I missed it.  I can't believe what I could have been doing better.  We had so many things that we were going to get to in this first hour, and they've all  been blown out by Pauly reliving his years of scorch abuse.  You were with him for 10 years? 
[00:26:30]  No.  Two.  Two.  Yeah.  He was on the air for about like 40.  It was like dog years.  Oh, my God.  He's passionate.  Yeah.  He said, hooray for Paulywood.  And we had a jingle for that.  Hooray for Paulywood.  Paulywood.  Yeah.  I think he would just play hooray for Hollywood and just kind of potted back.  Of course.  Yeah.  It's obvious.  Paulywood.  Did he have listeners?  Did he have big ratings? 
[00:27:00]  No.  No.  No, he didn't.  Wasn't popular.  No.  This is the part where we spin Pauly around, right?  We spin him around, around, around, around, around, let him try to walk.  We call it Cerebral Pauly.  See?  That would be worth watching.  Listening to.  Forgot on P...  Well, here we go.  Could do it on PFG TV.  Very funny.  We had three phone lines.  Yeah.  Like here, we have like 15 or whatever.  I don't know.  We had three.  And then if all three lit up, you guys remember, it'd be a very exciting day. 
[00:27:30]  Because that wouldn't happen every day that all three lit up.  And he had a catchphrase.  And this wasn't something he said on the air.  Oh, shit.  This is something he said for us.  Do you remember what it was?  I remember he had a catchphrase.  Oh, fuck.  Give me one word of the catchphrase.  Lookie.  Oh, yeah.  Lookie, lookie, uh...  Dude, lookie, lookie, miss cookie.  Oh, that's right.  Miss cookie.  Lookie, lookie, miss cookie.  He would say that if the phone lines roll it?  Yeah.  There were three calls, yeah.  Three calls.  He got very excited.  They're all lit. 
[00:28:00]  That meant he was doing a very good radio show.  Or a bit.  Lookie, lookie, miss cookie.  Now we're going to shoot him up with some Novocaine on half his face.  And we'll call the segment Bell's Pauly.  He's a great bitch.  Fucking poor Pauly.  Pauly talks about Scorch making his life miserable.  Been to Central New York for a long time.  You remember Scorch.  Right.  Pauly was Scorch's sidekick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And pocket bitch.  And because of that, Pauly has been angry for years because Scorch's show essentially derailed you from doing anything. 
[00:28:30]  It ruined radio for you.  Yeah.  It just made me miserable.  Do you think you were not miserable for that?  Do you make you miserable?  No, no.  Like towards work.  All right.  Working with him.  So you didn't even enjoy coming into work anymore.  Oh, man.  Despise it.  How many years did you do that?  Imagine if you...  Two.  We did.  Imagine if you had to come in and you knew you were just going to do the wheel of meat, the color of the day.  Yeah, I know.  And you would do these open-ended stupid questions like for trivia like 50% of men do this. 
[00:29:00]  Did he get ratings?  No.  All right.  All right.  I get worried about this town sometimes.  I know.  Because what happened is, and if you're just catching up, the wheel of meat was essentially a cell phone being slammed down on the counter.  It's theater of the mind.  It's stupid old radio hacky crap.  Because you don't have a demo tape because everything you did was Scorch's show.  Yeah.  The wheel...  Imagine, like, being a PD and me sending a tape of the wheel of meat.  You having to laugh at the wheel of meat. 
[00:29:30]  I got my meat in my meat.  So it was me laughing.  Yeah.  And then I would leave work, and I had a pretty sweet bachelor pad back in the day in-ground swimming.  How did a show become about Pauly?  Pauly, it says here you have experience in douche or salad dressing.  I would leave...  Douche or dressing?  Now, is that your bed?  I would leave work, and Scorch would show up.  Like, I'd go home, take my nap afterwards, and I would go out to my swimming pool, and Scorch would be laid by my pool. 
[00:30:00]  He comes over to your house now.  Just show up.  He'd be smoking weed by my pool.  So you hung out with him?  No, I couldn't shake the son of a bitch.  You're that hard.  Holy shit.  Oh, man.  Poor guy.  This is the kind of impact that he had on people.  Like, for as long as I've been on the show is how long it's been since Pauly was with Scorch.  Wow.  Wow.  And we still can't stop talking about it. 
[00:30:30]  Can't stop talking?  It's a special guy.  We've been out of Boston for 15 years, and we still talk about it.  He's a special guy.  You know, he told me, remember when you guys did Feels for Meals?  Yeah.  He informed me that that was his, and he gave it to you.  Oh, that's right.  I remember that.  Because it rhymes, and it's so good, he wanted to, like, take it for his own.  He said that, like.  Yeah, I gave it to him.  And then he said, yeah, we guys, you know, we trade bits sometimes.  No, we don't.  We never traded anything.  And he also made it seem, like, as if I knew, but I pretended I didn't know. 
[00:31:00]  Like, he made it seem like you guys took douche or dressing.  Not like that you.  No, we took it to market one day.  No, he said that you guys.  We actually did it one day just to see, you know, to show people how ridiculous it was.  No, he told me that you guys, like, did it.  Like, it was one of the many bits that they took from me.  I'm cool with it.  Yeah.  Brilliant radio minds just working together.  Yeah, you know.  Just changing ideas. 
[00:31:30]  Helping each other out.  You got to share the joy of the Scorch Pits.  I don't mind.  He would always tell me that you guys, there was some wrestling show that they had coffins  out, and you guys were afraid to lay in the coffin.  It wasn't that we were afraid.  But Scorch would lay in the coffin.  No problem.  No problem.  It was the most, yeah, ridiculous thing ever.  And we loved wrestling back then.  Even at the very beginning of my radio career, which is what it was back then, the thought  of looking that stupid and laying in some coffin at ringside at a wrestling match was 
[00:32:00]  like, I'm like, no, I'm not doing that.  You can't do that?  No.  Hey, the coffin's still open.  Scorch, man.  You got them coffin seats?  He couldn't believe we were just giving up the coffin seats.  He was amazed.  And he laid right in them.  Give me the coffin seats.  Remember we kind of hung out in the back.  We stood up in the back watching.  And we just saw Scorch there.  Man, sit near the coffin seat.  Like making a big scene. 
[00:32:30]  He was making a scene.  He was selling it.  He was trying to get involved with the action.  He was jumping up hoping somebody was going to throw a chair at him or something.  Where was that?  That wrestling show.  Do you remember offhand?  That's probably Worcester Centrum.  You think?  It was that big of a gig?  I felt like it was a smaller place.  Not that it matters.  More Pauly on this show in Syracuse trashing his old pal Scorch.  I'm liking the pain.  I'm sweating right now.  I've got like the anxiety's killing me. 
[00:33:00]  I have real meat sweats.  It's such pleasure for me.  It's such pleasure to watch.  We've got a real meat sweats right here on your station.  K-Rock 100.9.  We're 65.  Showgirl Stacy is admitting to the fact that she hung out at Harbor Fest with Scorch one year.  Oh, boy.  That sounds like Scorch.  Was he married?  Did he have kids?  No, no.  She hung out with him?  He had two dogs and he smelled like pee all the time.  Oh, what the hell was going on here?  What is wrong with Stone?  He had dog hair all over Marcos.  You know what?  He's a nice guy. 
[00:33:30]  I feel bad.  No, I mean, he might be a nice guy, but he's not good at radio.  He's not good at radio.  He's a nice guy that hung out by her pool for two years.  He had covered in dog hair, hanging out with showgirls at Harbor Fest.  Get the wheel on it.  Really?  Get the wheel on it.  Really?  Wow.  Do you really have dog hair on him all the time?  Yeah.  Did he smell like dog?  Was there maybe an accident that could have happened on his clothing?  I mean, yeah, but that's neither here nor there.  Sure.  You know, but that's not what we're talking about.  No, no.  Of course not.  I don't know why Paulie has to go on the radio and announce that people smell like piss. 
[00:34:00]  Paulie's killing it.  Oh, yeah.  We have one more clip.  Yeah, this last clip is the actual, the game.  They decide to play Wheel of Meat.  All right.  But a Scorch staple.  They did it in a mocking, in a mocking fashion.  It wasn't a tribute.  Something that people need to realize is when Scorch did these bits, there was no mocking.  He wasn't being ironic.  No. 
[00:34:30]  This was like, yeah, this is really good people talking about Wheel of Meat.  He, he, he.  Oh.  Hey, welcome to Wheel of Meat.  What's the meat?  Pulled pork.  Pulled pork, it is not.  Pulled pork.  Oh, sorry, thanks for calling.  But how's the bit go?  Like, he slammed something on the table, and then you have to figure out what meat he slammed on the table?  Yeah, like, but we would never have meat when he did it.  Of course not.  You'd just go like, what kind of meat was that? 
[00:35:00]  Called up now.  You wheel the meat.  Who would give a shit about that?  No, but you'd have to have the wheel sound effect first.  Right, right.  And you'd be like, okay, I'm going to spin, I'm going to spin.  Spin the weird.  And then he's like, ah, there it is.  Wheel the meat.  What do you think?  What do you think?  I hate this one.  No?  Why is it working? 
[00:35:30]  Oh, that sucks.  Oh, well.  Aren't they supposed to check that every day?  That's brand new.  Oh, hi.  Hi, um, Scorch?  Yeah?  Um, I like to guess, um, London Broil?  No, it's not London Broil.  Next caller.  Scorch, how you doing?  Yeah, you're at Wheel of Meat.  Um, I'm thinking something like a, uh, a New York strip steak.  Oh, very close, but no.  No.  Wheel of Meat. 
[00:36:00]  That's the bit.  That's the bit.  K-Rock, hello, welcome to Wheel of Meat.  What's the meat that you heard?  Let me play it again for you.  Here, slam it real hard.  Slam my meat.  Oh, I beat my meat.  Oh, I beat my meat hard.  He would do that, double entendre, sure.  Walk along, what is double?  Walk out, walk out.  Look, me to my beaten, honey.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[00:36:30]  What's the meat of my beaten, honey?  It was a big 16-ounce airline.  It was a big tube snake.  Big tube snake, buddy.  Oh, my God.  They are hammering him.  You got it right.  It was a steak.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  They killed him.  Yeah, Paulie started texting me yesterday.  He goes, dude, what's your email?  And I sent it to him, and he goes, I just, I killed Scorch on the camera this morning. 
[00:37:00]  He felt guilty, right?  He did.  He felt really guilty.  And Scorch knows about it because of his, his fucking, yeah.  Paulie was so, I've never seen anybody so frustrated.  Wow, really?  As Paulie over there, especially, I mean, the amount of times he was told, don't even  worry about it.  Me and you, we're going places.  I'm sending our stuff out, you know, we're getting some, we're getting some listens, some  people interested, getting some bites here, getting some bites.  We're going to, we're going to go and do this somewhere else. 
[00:37:30]  And he didn't get one day notice that he was leaving to New Hampshire.  No, no, not even a day.  He knew, but Scorch knew way before that.  Oh, yeah, but he didn't tell him.  No, he told him the night before.  Yeah, tomorrow's it.  Hey kid, tomorrow's it.  And how long was Paulie on a radio for?  A good while.  He had like a part-time gig at the local ESPN affiliate.  But beyond that, he didn't have much for a while.  He's doing all right now?  Now he's doing all right.  He's full-time shifts and everything.  Yeah, he's doing pretty well.  Is he at the station that he was just on? 
[00:38:00]  I don't know if he's at K-Rock or not.  He must, it seems like he must.  He might be.  He must be there.  And he's still, I think he's still doing ESPN radio in Syracuse.  Yeah.  He's got some stuff going on now.  It's so classic.  But Scorch has like a heart of gold.  He does.  That's why Paulie's probably feeling a little bad about it.  Does he have a heart of gold though?  Oh, yeah.  He's the nicest guy.  He just doesn't have an awareness.  Yeah, yeah.  Like to interact with.  A little self-awareness, really.  No, no.  To talk to, like to sit down and have a conversation with. 
[00:38:30]  He's delusional.  Right.  But he's not mean.  He doesn't mean any harm.  Although, he's completely selfish.  Right, right.  That's what I'm saying.  So where's the nice guy part come in?  Yeah.  If he's totally selfish, then he's not a nice guy.  But he doesn't see it as selfish.  No, he doesn't.  That's where I go back to the lack of self-awareness.  This is the way it is, you know, this is the life we have chosen.  Right.  Paulie, I don't think I'm the one that has to tell you.  Without the business, there's no show. 
[00:39:00]  Right.  This is the life we have chosen.  This is what we do.  So if I have to move on and you're here, you know, it's this thing that we do.  Yeah, where's the nice guy part of?  He left his partner the next day without a gig.  It was a good ride, Paulie.  You've got to understand.  But I'll see if I can get some money for you when I'm up there.  It's business, Jimmy.  You're taking it very personally. 
[00:39:30]  It's a difficult situation.  It's a very difficult situation.  Situation.  Situation.  Well, you're going to be the boss?  It's a very difficult situation.  We do have a brand new PFG TV, but, you know, too much scorch for today.  Too much scorch.  We'll have to wait on this one for a while.  Save that a little.  Yeah, I think the Paulie bits, it was like one bit a day for the week.  So I think probably like Monday was probably hooray for Paulie Wood. 
[00:40:00]  Wait.  Paulie did a scorch.  Oh.  No, yeah.  No, no, no.  I was thinking that this show.  Oh.  No, I was just figuring out my own stupid head.  But I thought Paulie was on this particular show for a week doing a scorch bit every day.  That would be the bit.  That would be nice.  And then Paulie Get Your Poon was Wednesdays.  I think Psychic Bonnie called in on Thursdays.  Oh, God.  What was that?  What was Psychic Bonnie?  Psychic Bonnie is a radio psychic that would call in once a week. 
[00:40:30]  And has literally been with Scorch 20 years at this point.  And just wherever Scorch goes, Psychic Bonnie goes.  Psychic Bonnie, good enough.  We're a team.  So, Psychic Bonnie, what do you got today?  I can't remember how he described Psychic Bonnie.  There was some way, like some kind of mind-blowing thing that he said along with, you know,  Psychic Bonnie is going to be on the show ready to blow your minds.  But it wasn't blow your minds. 
[00:41:00]  It was something better.  It was probably some sexual innuendo, right?  Yeah, there had to be a little innuendo thrown in there.  He's a big fan of that.  Is she a good psychic?  No.  No.  No.  Psychics are terrible.  Okay, yeah.  Wednesday afternoon's at 4 p.m., Psychic Bonnie freaks out.  The afternoon Lumpa Nation.  The what nation?  Lumpa Nation.  What is that?  I'm not sure.  Wait, he changed it to the Lumpa Nation? 
[00:41:30]  I mean, I don't know.  It seems like when he left Syracuse.  Maybe he wasn't allowed to take the naked militia with him.  Maybe the radio station owned that.  Right, and now it's Lumpa Nation.  Wow.  Wow.  I remember Pauly asked him one day, why the fuck do you keep saying naked militia?  Off the air.  He's like, why do you call this a naked militia?  Nobody's ever naked in here.  Plus the fact that it makes Pauly look bad that he's hanging out naked with another dude. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, everyone's naked.  Totally nude radio.  Me and Pauly are naked.  Are you naked at home?  It's a naked militia.  Totally nude.  Totally nude radio.  Pauly's like, nobody thinks we're naked.  And Scorch goes, no, you've got to understand.  It's like we're an army, like a militia, like an army.  But it's peaceful because nobody could fight a naked guy.  If somebody's naked, it couldn't be more peaceful.  We used to do Afternoon Drive, and early on, before Dave Douglas made the big pizza-slash-hamburger analogy decision, 
[00:42:30]  Scorch was unfortunately pizza, and Dave wanted, I don't know, hamburgers or something.  I think you guys were hamburgers.  And that meant Rocco had to replace Scorch.  Man, I remember we would be in an R show, and R show would be crazy back then.  But Scorch would set up just this party every night, remember?  Yeah, yeah.  He would bring in a boombox.  It was just, he was just, why do you bring a boombox to a radio station?  I don't know. 
[00:43:00]  But he would set up the studio like he was going to have a party there every night.  Totally nude.  It's all appearance.  And then Rocco didn't disappoint, because he would set up a buffet every night.  Yeah, he'd have fucking 20 restaurants around the area on notice.  You want to talk about real Plugola.  I'd fuck around and fool around with it here and make fun of it.  Rocco was all in with Plugola.  Oh, yeah.  He had every restaurant on speed dial, and he would pick a different restaurant every night,  and it would be a huge buffet.  And we didn't complain, because when we were staying late, back in the days when we used to stay after our radio show. 
[00:43:30]  What?  And get our work done.  Then we'd go back in the studio and have a little nice food.  Yeah, I want to thank the Ramada Inn for coming here.  They'd bring chafing dishes and fucking just all kinds of food.  And it wasn't even in the studio, because it was so much shit.  They used to go into the conference room and set it up on those giant conference tables.  It was like a fucking buffet.  What time was he?  Oh, you guys were, what time?  Three to seven.  What time was he on?  Seven.  Seven at midnight. 
[00:44:00]  I thought he was a morning guy.  Oh.  No, no, no, no.  No, Rocco was a...  No.  No, Hillman was the morning.  What was Scorch on?  Scorch was on before Rocco.  So he was...  Scorch?  Rocco replaced Scorch.  Oh, he replaced him?  Yes.  Oh.  Yes.  When we first got there, Scorch was after us.  Yep.  And we absolutely got along with Scorch and liked him.  We ended up liking Rocco as well, but we were bummed to see Scorch go.  He's the man.  And I think he was the one that told us.  Well, Dave told me.  On pizza, he was looking for a hamburger. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, he told the story.  I'm going to go find some of that Link's pizza now.  Good luck to you guys.  He went to...  And Rocco, with the famous TV incident, which we haven't talked about in a while,  Ant was always into technology, always getting the latest gadgets, even back then.  Dude.  And he would have a tiny little TV so we could kind of watch the local news or whatever  the fuck while we're doing our radio show.  Now we got...  Look at...  Wow, we've come a long way.  We got eight TVs in here now.  It was like a fucking nine-inch portable television.  Because we didn't have a TV in that studio. 
[00:45:00]  No.  And we always thought, look, you know, we should have some kind of TV on constantly because  we'll play off that, which we do to this day.  Right.  So Ant brought in a tiny little...  Yeah, sorry.  Portable TV to set up every day.  Yeah.  And Rocco would always have, like I said, chafing dishes.  And then he'd have, like, fucking shrimp cocktail on ice in a big bus tray.  Like a bus tray full of fucking ice with fucking, like, shrimp in it.  For a nighttime radio show.  Yes.  Every night.  He was eating like a king. 
[00:45:30]  He didn't give a crap.  He couldn't even focus on a show until he had his order in for the night.  So you fucking, him or one of the dummies that worked for him took my little TV and put  it aside with everything else, but put it on top of the ice that was in one of the bus  trays.  Which makes sense at first.  Set it on top of there.  Yeah.  And left.  Yeah.  Now, meanwhile, you can figure out what's going to happen.  The fucking ice melts.  And then when we come in, there's a bus tray full of water with my TV in it. 
[00:46:00]  Floating.  Yeah.  Did that TV ever work again?  I forget.  I think it did.  I think it dried out and it was all right.  I poured out the water and then let it dry for quite a while.  Yeah.  Paulie walked out on the show once.  Oh.  One time he got really pissed off and walked out on the show.  I just remembered because Scorch, whenever he would go to an event that he had to dress  up for, he would wear like red or yellow or purple suits. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, God.  Like he had a purple suit, like the kind of suit like a black guy would wear in like 93.  Making some noise.  Right.  He was in showbiz though, man.  Right.  Like a wrestling suit.  I understand.  He's in showbiz.  So, Paulie went on the air and was busting his balls for it and said, that's a black man's  suit.  What are you doing wearing a black man's suit?  And Scorch is like, there's nothing black about that suit.  That's not a black man's suit.  And Paulie goes, only black people wear that suit.  And Scorch would go, there's a lot of white people wearing suits like that. 
[00:47:00]  And Paulie would go, Paulie said, no, name one white person other than you that wears  those suits.  And Scorch goes, no, the problem is, obviously, you're racist.  Paulie said, he's racist?  Paulie went, what?  And Scorch said, yeah, you're obviously racist.  And Paulie said, you can't call me racist on the air.  Oh, shit.  And Scorch goes, well, what you said is very racist.  You're racist.  Where's the nice guy part of Scorch?  Where is it?  Jimmy's still trying to figure it out.  You said not one thing that made me think he's a nice guy. 
[00:47:30]  That's true.  Paulie almost...  You had to be around him.  He almost cursed on the air.  Right.  As soon as they went to commercial break, he threw his headphones across the room and  said, you can't call me a racist on the air and walked out.  How about was Paulie doing radio before he met Scorch?  He was doing nights before he met Scorch and said he was doing pretty well.  He's probably doing, you know, six or seven years.  Oh, so he was like a legit radio guy.  Yeah.  Okay.  And he didn't know Scorch stunk when he hooked up with him? 
[00:48:00]  It was the morning show, so it was like...  But that's the thing.  Like, he tricks everyone.  No one knows that he actually stinks.  He's got passion for radio, and he comes up with all these bits and...  And when you talk to him...  And he's never not worked.  He's been working ever since we left.  Right.  He always finds a job.  Always.  And he's always hustling.  Right.  And when you talk to him, he's got all these ideas.  I mean, he told me, he guaranteed me that he'd be on XM Satellite Radio within three 
[00:48:30]  months, the first time I met him.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I actually should be on XM within three months, so maybe if this works out, you can come  with me.  Okay, cool.  And then three months later, he's like, it's actually looking more like Christmas.  And then, you know...  It just goes away, yeah.  He's still on radio.  He's doing TV now, too, so...  Right.  Fuck's doing a great bullshitter.  Was there ever a moment where you felt like, wow, this guy's going to take me?  Like, when you first went there, do you ever think, like, man, this guy might be  legit?  No.  Not even a first...  No.  No, I think I could see where somebody would, but I think being around this show and you 
[00:49:00]  guys, I was pessimistic, and, you know, my bullshit meter was on all the time.  I had an idea you were here before Scorch.  I always thought you were there first.  No, I was here...  Fuck, man.  I was here before Scorch, and then I went back and interned for him for a year.  Because occasionally, we would get updates from Sam.  That's right.  He would call.  We were so excited when we found out.  Yeah, as a matter of fact...  And he'd give us Scorch updates.  I told Scorch it would be a good idea.  He had the original Oompa Loompas on his show, and I told him it'd be a great crossover  idea.  Right.  If he called O&A. 
[00:49:30]  I do remember that.  Yeah.  And he called you guys, and I was there with him, and you were moaned the Oompa Loompas.  That's right.  Is that worth replaying?  It was really funny.  They were horrified.  Can we replay that?  If we can find it?  I don't remember the jokes, but I remember that phone call.  Yeah.  I mean, you really...  They were the original.  He was like, hello, fellas!  And then you started...  I don't remember Ramonim.  Is Irak there, or is he helping Sal with a phone call?  Oh, wow.  Irak, do you have that?  I'm looking for it.  Okay. 
[00:50:00]  I don't remember that at all.  I just remember that.  I didn't know you went with us at that point.  Fuck.  Yeah, I was in Syracuse on the other end of the phone.  Was Scorch on with us?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I got to hear this.  I got to hear it, too.  We weren't respectful to the Oompas.  Yeah, and then...  You'll hear in the clip.  He, uh...  You started cursing, and he goes,  Oop, got to dub out that.  Right.  Except he was lying.  He wasn't on the air.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, he was making it up.  It's all coming back to me now.  I thought you were like, are you in trouble?  He was like, yeah, you know what?  I don't care. 
[00:50:30]  But it's because he wasn't on the air.  He was taping it.  Yeah, he was taping it while the songs were playing.  Did he ever play it?  I don't know.  No.  I bet horribly edited or never played it right.  Because his thing would be like, you know, he wouldn't want to give you guys the shine.  Right, right.  He was like, oh, you know, I'm kind of doing my Scorch thing right now.  More of the nice guy Scorch thing.  Yeah.  I've seen not, again, if I met him, I might like him.  I've seen not or heard one bit of evidence that he's a nice guy.  He's just kind of like a lovable.  Sam now that he's a hustler.  Yeah.  He's a hustler.  He's definitely a hustler. 
[00:51:00]  I respect that.  But he's kind of like a lovable, like, oh.  He almost feels bad.  Yeah.  I'm sorry for him.  Like, let him fucking get one over.  Yeah, like, he can't help himself.  He's rooting for the underdog.  You want him to get one over on everybody, because he's always trying to get one over.  And he just never quite gets over, but spins that story.  So it sounds like what worked out was his initial intention.  Right, right, right.  Like Ralph Cranston.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I got to bring up my good points, like this one. 
[00:51:30]  Sweetest guy in the world.  I think I said before, he's honest to God.  The closest human I've ever met to David Brent from The Office.  Like, he is the radio version of that guy.  And you can't hate him, obviously.  No, that's what I'm saying.  David Brent is, like, not a nice guy.  You can't hate David Brent, and he's not a nice guy.  Yeah, that's a great way to put it.  You're like, oh, man.  Because it's so hard to explain it.  You understand the desperation driving what's happening.  But he'll never admit it.  Right.  Because he probably doesn't know it.  Because of the lack of self-awareness, which I go back to. 
[00:52:00]  Wow.  Yeah, he is.  He's David Brent in radio.  He's been a rape up there.  You almost want to hug him.  You almost want to just give him a hug.  Yeah.  Come on, buddy.  Come here, Scorch.  You say, come here, Fatty?  No, Buddy.  Oh, I think he's Fatty.  Scorch is not overweight.  He's not, right?  Mm-mm.  Do we have that clippy rock?  That might be a tough one to find today, huh?  I don't know.  Should be in worse.  Can you just look up Ramon?  Oompa Loompas?  Yeah, I found the Scorch call, but I was isolating the actual Ramon call from that. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, okay.  He shouldn't hear the call.  I don't know what he says.  How long is the whole thing?  The whole thing is like over eight minutes, but I'm just getting right to the remote.  Fuck it.  What else are we doing?  Love to hear it.  I mean, after all this Scorch stuff, to hear us interacting with Scorch.  Yeah, just start it up.  It's like the Flintstones and the Jetsons.  Right.  We don't have ratings.  Who cares?  What year is this?  We don't have a boss.  We have nothing.  It's 2005.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Wow.  That's eight fucking years ago.  Eight years ago.  This was early on in the satellite days.  It was probably like September, October of 2005.  Oh, the end. 
[00:53:00]  November of 2005.  November, yeah.  So what are we in now?  We're in April of 13?  Seven and a half years ago.  God damn.  Seven, yeah.  Whatever.  Me neither.  All right.  Yeah, just push play.  Let's see what this is all about.  All right.  One second.  This is when I still look like a kid.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  You're a little baby face.  Now look at you.  Yeah.  Just a wreck.  It's a five o'clock shadow with fucking 7 a.m.  No, it's kind of creepy.  Coming on.  Oh, I love Sam looking at his fucking youth in the rearview mirror.  That's it for that. 
[00:53:30]  It was nice, right?  I hope I made the most of it.  It was fun.  All right.  Let's hear this.  There you are.  Let's say hi to Scorch in Syracuse.  What's up, boys?  The kingdom of nakedness.  It's the naked militia now, Opie.  No, it'll always be known as the kingdom of nakedness.  Naked militia.  He's upgraded.  What's up, guys?  You're a hamburger. 
[00:54:00]  No, you're pizza.  I'm pizza.  I was like, no, you're a hamburger.  You're the best.  I've gone already.  I'm a hamburger.  Yeah, I think I might have been pizza, but they wanted burgers.  They wanted good.  But I was the best pizza man in the business.  Best pizza ever, but they wanted hamburgers.  And you know what?  God damn it, I still am.  Scorch is a friend of the show and has always been a friend of the show.  Always been.  He wasn't an enemy that turned into a friend or a friend that turned into an enemy.  He's been a friend that continues to be a friend.  Yes.  That's nice.  Are you going to sing a Clarence Clemens song to me now?  Maybe you're a friend of mine? 
[00:54:30]  He got terrific.  We couldn't wait to pounce.  We didn't even give him a chance.  One joke.  One bad joke.  And you used every sound effect.  We couldn't wait.  You just killed him.  But that was literally sound clips that could have been played this morning or fucking yesterday.  Wow, that was great.  God, our voices sound a little weird, though. 
[00:55:00]  Strange.  Yeah.  Was the processing different back then?  There wasn't any.  Maybe.  Is that what that is?  Yeah.  XM didn't believe in it, remember?  No.  I thought it was hope.  Yeah, there's some excitement in our voices.  I heard enthusiasm.  That's what it was.  There's an ounce of enthusiasm in your voices, which is weird.  Yeah, it is strange to hear.  Are you going to sing a Clarence Clemens song to me now?  Maybe you're a friend of mine? 
[00:55:30]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Scorch does mornings in Syracuse.  Yeah, where are you, Scorch?  Going down the toilet after that, thanks.  What station?  Uh, Rock 105, the dog.  The dog.  The dog.  Of course, the naked militia as well.  Sign up for that.  Talk to these Oompa Loompas, because they're very cool.  You got Oompa Loompas in the studio?  I've got the original Oompa Loompas, Malcolm and Rusty. 
[00:56:00]  Are you sure they're real Oompa Loompas?  Because we know that there were a couple of imposters out there.  No, these guys are real.  Like Wizard of Oz midgets.  They run around saying that they're Wizard of Oz midgets when they're really not.  No, these guys are Oompa Loompas.  Who does that?  They're original Willy Wonka midgets.  So, why don't you talk to them?  Say hello.  How old are they now?  How old are you?  Well, good morning.  How are you?  Oh, they're from England.  My name is Rusty, and I was an original Oompa Loompa, and I'm just over 50 years of age. 
[00:56:30]  And I've got Malcolm Dixon here.  Say hello.  Could you, um, could you sing us a piece of the Oompa Loompa song?  Oh, that would be great.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, Oompa Loompa, Doompa-dee-doo, I've got a perfect puzzle for you.  Oompa Loompa, Doompa-dee-dee, say hello to Opie and Anthony.  Oh, look at that.  I didn't get one of those on my show.  Scorch doesn't rhyme with Opie and Anthony. 
[00:57:00]  I hated it.  I like, I thought it was kind of cute, because it was like, I actually had no idea you were  going to do that.  But, um, so what do you guys do now besides, like, just kind of, just tour and stuff like  that?  Oh, Jerry's already laughing.  We're going to go for an event in Auburn at, uh, we're going to meet two munchkins, and  Oh, there's still munchkins alive?  Yes.  Speaking of the munchkins, I gotta, uh, tell the gang here on our show, uh, David Spade's  new show on Comedy Central Showbiz.  Oh, my God.  He played some audio clips of the munchkins talking. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Holy shit, we gotta get the audio.  Really?  Yeah, they did a whole press tour where they were on GMA and all this.  Oh, are you guys, uh, live with us?  Uh, not, no, we ain't.  Oh, you had to dump out?  I didn't know we were, like, uh, simulcasting today, Scorch.  You guys sorry, Scorch.  No, that's okay.  What the fuck do I care?  No, you can't.  Oh, was I live just then?  I'm sorry.  No.  All right, just tell us not to curse.  Are we live in Syracuse?  No, yeah, you are, but that's okay.  Okay.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You're lying.  Yeah, he's lying.  No, I don't have a license after today, anyway. 
[00:58:00]  Wait.  No, this is, you know, this is satellite radio.  We can curse and stuff.  That's why satellite radio, much cooler than commercial radio.  That's why I'm coming to XM starting January.  Oh, did I let that slip out?  Whoa.  All right, pause.  Just pause.  There's too much going on here.  Oh, did I let that slip out?  Whoa, whoa.  Did you see the David Brent a little bit?  Yeah.  Yes, of course.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Oh, did I let that slip out?  Two lies there.  We weren't live in Syracuse that day.  No, definitely not.  I remember specifically.  And Scorch did not have a deal with XM.  Not even close. 
[00:58:30]  Because I remember thinking, like, that was kind of, I'd only known for a few months.  And I remember thinking, why did he just say we were live?  We're not live.  Why would he say that just now?  Well, he said no, yeah.  Like, you lied and then just told the truth and lied.  Because it's dangerous.  Yeah.  Scorch likes to be dangerous.  And then he said he's coming to XM in, that would have been January 2006.  Right.  How much more time on this phone call?  You still have almost five minutes.  All right, keep playing it.  Let's see where it goes. 
[00:59:00]  That's why satellite radio is much cooler than commercial radio.  That's why I'm coming to XM starting January.  Oh, did I let that slip out?  Whoa.  Are you really?  We'll talk.  Anyway, what else is going on?  Talk to these guys.  I hope not.  What's that, Scorch?  I don't need the kingdom of nakedness on this fine platform.  Naked militia.  Naked militia.  You want to talk to the Oompa Loompas?  Yes, I'm sorry.  Yeah, the Oompa Loompas.  Actually, we have a lot of people calling in that wanted to talk with the Oompa Loompas. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, no.  Yeah.  That's good.  Yeah.  One of which, we got Steve.  Is that Steve?  Yeah, we got Steve on the phone.  We're national, so we're all over, and this call is coming from Yellowstone.  Yes.  He's a big fan of the movie, so let's talk to Steve.  See if I can make this work here.  Steve, you there?  Oh, my God.  Hello.  Hi.  Are these guys really?  Are you guys imposters, or are you for real?  We are for real.  We are for real.  And you can come and see us in Oompa, New York.  You can come and touch us if you like. 
[01:00:00]  And I'm just talking to the chicks there.  I am actually a very big fan.  Oh, my God.  Are you the only two Oompa Loompas, or are there more?  There are three guys still alive.  Ramone!  And there's a little girl.  In fact, she lives in a twilight hole in England.  Ramone!  Kill these green-haired little savages.  Hey, Ramone!  Ramone, bring me a spoiled family photograph.  What about the orange fangs? 
[01:00:30]  Ramone!  Drown these two like the Smith children.  Hey, guys, I got to go.  Ramone, bring me a singing piece of shit.  I just arrived in Syracuse.  Steve.  I'm sorry.  Steve, I got to apologize.  For Steve from Yellowstone, he's very inappropriate, and he is not for broadcast radio with his language. 
[01:01:00]  That's right.  Horrid.  Hey, guys, I'm glad I can hook you up with the Oompa Loompas, but I got to run and do a show and get no ratings.  Okay, Scorch.  We'll talk soon, man.  Ruined family photograph.  My favorite. 
[01:01:30]  Wow.  That was it.  Pretty much.  That was fucking...  Holy fuck.  Many years ago.  Seven and a half years ago.  Amazing.  Oh, is that funny?  Ramone, you wouldn't stop.  Yeah, I got to go, guys.  And that would be a great example of what I want us to have on iTunes.  I guess we're still in the talking stage.  We have so many years of material that we'll never get on this channel.  I never would have thought of that again if we didn't.  Yeah, I forgot all about it.  And I went to these dummies down the hall. 
[01:02:00]  I said, look, we need to be in the iTunes slash podcast world.  I get that you don't want to put the current shit up there.  You know, that's a conflict of interest.  But we have all these years of archived stuff that is just sitting there that we really can't do much with.  We could pull out a piece every once in a while like we did today.  So I said, look, an hour, an hour a week of just classic O&A up on iTunes and with a little mention that we're still doing it.  We're on SiriusXM.  And we're still talking about it. 
[01:02:30]  Again, it's sludge.  It's unbelievable.  How great would that be?  It will never change.  Just a quick hour.  Quick fucking best of bits from all over the place.  Once a week, that's it.  People would fucking eat that shit up.  And then, you know, you would probably turn people on to the current show.  They're still in the talk stage for that as well.  Of course.  That's why at this point I barely say hi to the Radio Wizard.  Barely.  I couldn't even look him in the eye yesterday when I was leaving.  I didn't even know he was on vacation last week. 
[01:03:00]  He's gone all week last week.  I had no idea.  The whole week, yeah.  I swear I had no idea.  Yeah, Monday through Friday, I think.  You know, but whatever.  Sorry.  I didn't mean a bitch.  But that's a perfect example of what we want right there.  How great was that called?  Fucking hilarious.  With Jimmy doing the Ramon.  And then it's part of a little hour podcast.  Classic O&A, whatever the fuck you want to call it.  You could touch us, too, if you're the chicks.  Those guys were pretty good sports about it, though.  They were cool.  They were cool.  Jesus.  You know.  I mean, if anybody... 
[01:03:30]  Who wants to touch a midget?  I know.  Exactly.  With my bumper, I do.  If anybody knows about Sludge, though, it's obviously Scorch.  He was supposed to be here from all the way back in 2006.  Remember?  Oh, we'll let that slip.  Yeah, we'll talk.  We'll talk, will we?  We'll talk.  It wasn't true.  No!  All right.  Now I'm fucking...  Bumping me up to the main office.  Oh, what did I say?  Oh, no.  Like, that's a typical David Brent thing.  Yes. 
[01:04:00]  It really is.  Is that true?  We'll talk.  We'll talk.  At the party when the guy Malcolm calls him out and goes,  I heard it was because you failed your physical.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I failed my physical.  Like, he just told the truth but acted like he was lying?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's so sad.  All right.  I'm going to eat my sandwich.  Yeah, let's do that.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:04:30]  No matter what you are,  I will always be with you.  It doesn't matter what you do, girl.  We'll go with you.  No matter what you do.  It's like Groundhog Day.  This is Badfinger, right?  Yeah, this is Badfinger.  Firm.  Want to know why we're playing Badfinger today? 
[01:05:00]  I'm guessing some kind of anniversary.  Very good.  Remember Peter Hamm?  Peter Hamm.  He's the lead singer.  Was he the singer?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Well, he's dead.  What?  Yeah, he died.  When did that happen?  Oh, a long time ago.  Oh.  Yeah.  How did he die?  Hung himself.  What?  He was 27.  Oh, that's a shame.  Another rocker that was 27 when he died. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah?  Yep.  How long ago?  Back on this date in 1975.  On this date?  Yep.  In 1975?  You know, Paul McCartney had something to do with this band.  Really?  Yeah.  I believe the only band that was signed to Apple Records.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Didn't know that.  I've heard that the manager took all their money.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  And the band was pretty fucking desperate.  Yeah.  And enough of that horse shit. 
[01:06:00]  Well, by now you've probably seen and heard the tape.  A local anchor, his first day anchoring in the studio, and then he was fired for accidentally  cursing on air.  Well, this morning, A.J. Clemente is in our studio to talk about how it happened, when  he realized what he said had gone over the air, and what he's planning to do now.  7.30 now on a Wednesday morning.  It's the 24th of April, 2013.  I'm Savannah Guthrie.  Savannah Guthrie stinks.  Savannah Guthrie.  Yeah, they're getting their asses handed to them by everybody at this point. 
[01:06:30]  Today's show is on the decline.  Stupid George Stephanopoulos.  Stephanopoulos.  They're kicking their ass.  Wow.  Yeah, and Matt Lauer just, I don't know.  People started hating him for some reason.  Everyone's starting to hate Matt Lauer.  Yeah, that's weird.  Yep.  He's glib.  But they're going to have A.J. Clemente on.  We were close to getting him, and then fuck, we lost out to TV again.  Yeah.  TV's just glamorous for these fucking guys.  Yeah.  It's too bad. 
[01:07:00]  It is.  Oh, they got Buble, too?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Tomorrow on today, I'm going to have a live interview with former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura.  You guys miss me?  You guys miss me yet?  We can't have one.  I bet you do.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Let's go.  You guys want to have George to do with Bush?  Why not?  You guys want to have George to do with Bush?  We had the other guy on, the fucking lizard guy.  On the phone. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Rummy.  Yeah, we had Rummy.  That's pretty close to Bush.  Here she is.  NBC's Kristen Dahlgren.  Amanda!  Yeah!  All right, well.  Who is she?  She's that fucking Amanda Knox.  She's the broad from Spain.  Oh, she's pretty.  From Italy.  Well, that's some B-roll.  Oh.  That's many years ago.  Is that?  Okay.  A few years ago now, anyway.  Oh, no.  There's a current picture of her.  She looks pretty good.  If she had that weird little thing on her lip, I'd kiss it right away.  Would you?  I'd kiss that right away.  Yeah, that Amanda Knox is pretty cute. 
[01:08:00]  Girl next door look-ish-ish-ish.  I guess they have an article in People Magazine.  AJ Clemente had something going on with his lip, too.  You see that?  Was that a stress cold sore?  Man.  Can we play the tape again, please?  I'm just one guy.  You want to hear it again?  I'd love it.  Yeah, of course.  All right.  We have to play it again.  This fucking guy is classic.  He's going to end up doing very well.  I don't know.  He's going to be on Letterman.  He's going to be on the Today Show. 
[01:08:30]  He's going to be on MSNBC all this morning.  Is that going to get him a gig, you think?  I think it leads to something, yes.  I don't know what yet.  Here's why it's smart.  Because he'll show people that he's a fun guy.  He's not a bomb.  He just made a mistake.  It all depends how he handles himself today on these big interviews.  You know what I mean?  Fucking horrible racism and curses.  That'd be great.  How are they going to handle it on the Today Show?  Okay.  Be careful.  You're live right now.  That's what he's saying.  Hey.  I don't know.  Should we...  Just want to remind you.  Your mic's on.  Oh, I'm sure. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, God.  I bet they do that.  That's why I want to see this.  Look out.  Oh, boy.  Oh, we don't know what he's going to say.  You're watching the Evening Sunday on NBC North Dakota News, your news leader in high definition.  Gay fucking shit.  Good evening.  I'm Van Tew.  You may have seen our newest from AJ on NBC North Dakota News, and you'll be joining the  Weekend News team as my co-anchor.  Tell us a little bit about yourself, AJ. 
[01:09:30]  Thanks, Van.  I'm very excited.  I graduated from West Virginia University, and I'm used to, you know, from being from the  East Coast.  Okay, well, welcome to...  Fatal ATV crash happened yesterday.  To being in from Nick.  That could be better than the actual gay fucking shit.  You're used to being in from the East Coast.  He sounds like Bob Goldthwait when he starts to explain, like, yeah, I'm so panic-stricken.  Yeah, I can't wait to...  He really is a panicky peep.  Let's see how he handles himself. 
[01:10:00]  They're doing the weather.  Are they going to go right to him, you think?  He was on the couch.  Oh, look out.  Make sure his mic is off.  Oh, boy.  We're going to put you on delay.  Let's see.  How great would it be if he cursed again?  Oh, God.  Hey, you fucking assholes.  How you doing?  Or if he said, like, hey, hey, how you making out?  And he's like, you know, I'm a cunt hair away from getting a new job.  That would rule.  You know how bad the Today Show has gotten?  I just saw Al Roker.  He's outside doing the weather. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  That plaza used to be packed with people.  Yeah.  It's very sparse out there.  It's fucking freezing out, too.  Is it cold again today?  Ridiculous.  Fuck.  Enough with this cold.  We've got some showers.  What are you talking about?  Is today Wednesday?  We're going to get up to 72.  Are we?  That's nice.  Is it Wednesday?  I have my big coat.  It's Wednesday, right?  I swear I thought it was Tuesday.  I've got my big jacket.  Oh, no.  Oh, you're big.  On cable or weather.com online.  Look, there's no one out there.  Thank you very much.  And now to an emotional reunion that's tied to that tragedy in Boston. 
[01:11:00]  Oh.  A 20-year-old college student getting the chance to thank the individuals.  Oh, God.  They love squeaking these out.  I said that because I wanted to see A.J.  His name is not really A.J. Clemente.  What is it?  Alexander Barrero.  Alexander Barrero.  All right.  I guess A.J. Clemente is more of a news name.  Yeah, he got the news name without fucking being able to do that.  He's obviously not the smartest guy in the world, though, because his old tweets, his 
[01:11:30]  emails, his personal emails, he posted his flight itinerary for a trip he took a couple  months ago.  Right.  Why?  I don't know.  Look.  Who wants to see that?  It's all his flight information and his email.  He's not a smart guy.  I don't know.  Maybe he didn't mean to post that, did he?  Yeah, he did.  This guy's in.  Holy crap.  I just booked my Euro trip.  I'm so excited.  Is he a flying coach?  Yeah.  Economy.  Of course. 
[01:12:00]  All right.  We're kind of waiting for this A.J. Clemente.  I think it'll be funny to watch.  Oh, this guy carried this fucking girl, and she's all emotional now.  Oh, look at that.  A lot of stories coming out of Boston.  A lot of stories.  Stories.  Coming out of Boston.  Ow.  Yep, yep, yep.  Well, I guess she's okay.  She's got her feet.  My brother's brother-in-law was there that day.  Just finished, too.  Oh, yeah?  He's traumatized. 
[01:12:30]  Nothing happened to him, but he's just, like, fucking freaked out.  And he's a cop.  He's a cop that ran the Boston Marathon, my brother's brother-in-law.  And he finished at 4.07, like, just a mere two minutes before the blast.  Oh.  I don't have much there.  I'm just saying.  But he was just traumatized, even just, you know, being in the area.  I guess they're saying these guys, the White House is saying no ties.  No.  No ties, but, oh, boy.  They followed InfoWars.  That's coming out. 
[01:13:00]  Really?  Or is that something that the government is doing to discredit Alex Jones?  Oh, is that what Alex is saying?  Of course he'll say that.  He'll spin it.  Yeah.  Hmm.  I mean, InfoWars isn't exactly, I don't know, Al-Qaeda material.  Right.  And then this guy, you know, he goes to Russia, and then he comes back, and they totally drop the ball.  And that guy, what's the, that Napolitano guy, said that apparently his name was spelled differently when he came back. 
[01:13:30]  Like, it was an error on the ticket or that thing.  So they missed the whole thing.  They fucked up.  It's like, how do you fucking, so all terrorists have to do is change a letter in their name, and, you know.  That's it.  And they'll get through, and.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  There's a guy in our gym who sits there.  Yeah, Mr. Jim.  I got a new guy we got to talk about, too, by the way.  This guy you've probably seen.  Just reminded me of.  He babbles. 
[01:14:00]  Like, he's a really nice guy, and he's not creepy.  But, like, I'm afraid.  I say hi to him, but he just fucking yaps.  He yaps so much that I'll actually just politely, I walk away while he's talking.  I take care of him, and he just goes, okay.  I don't know him.  You've seen him.  Oh, hey.  And he was yapping about this yesterday, about the Russians.  You get a second chance in the business.  We're going to talk to A.J. Clemente about that.  And then.  They're going to tease it for a while.  Sorry, go ahead, Jimmy.  No, no, that's all.  I thought he was going live.  He was talking about this Russian situation, how he didn't think it was tied into anything. 
[01:14:30]  And I'm like, A, I don't agree, but B, I don't give a shit what he thinks.  Right.  Shut up.  Yeah, shut up.  Who are you?  I'm in your underwear.  Well, me and Jimmy walked into the locker room yesterday.  We started giggling like little fucking schoolgirls again, because that guy.  Someone's wee-wee out.  That guy again.  He was in his underwear yesterday.  He was just in his underwear standing there with this horrendous body just waiting for  someone he could talk to naked.  To bring his foot, to take his underwear off?  Yeah, because the black guy wasn't there yet, because we saw the back of this guy with just 
[01:15:00]  his underpants on, so we both assumed that the black guy was, he was facing the black  guy, but he wasn't.  Oh.  So he wasn't able to talk about the Knicks yesterday.  He was talking to some other guy.  But there's another guy I forgot to mention, which is a vain-legged guy.  Oh, God, I was talking.  Oh, my God.  Vain-legged guy.  Yeah.  We haven't brought him up yet.  Vain-legged guy.  He's got the most horrendous veiny legs.  It's creepy.  I don't know what the fuck's going on.  Obviously, he's got some kind of an issue or a problem, and he is always in the locker 
[01:15:30]  room.  He's not nude, but he always has his underpants up way too high as well.  What the fuck is going on in this locker room?  He's got these horrendously veiny legs.  The veins are, like, way popped out.  Like varicose veins?  I get it.  They're not even varicose.  They're like veins.  I would have said that.  I don't know what it is.  I think it's way worse than that.  I think he pulls trains for a living.  That's what he does. 
[01:16:00]  He's a fucking train puller.  But he looks old school.  He's probably, like, 60.  I mean, he's much older than he looks.  He's probably 65 or 70 years old.  He looks like he would fucking just kick your ass.  Yeah.  He's old school.  Very intimidating.  But he wears his underpants a little too high, and then he's got these legs that, I  don't know, the veins are really just completely popping out.  And hundreds of them.  Garden hose, yeah.  It's not just a little bit.  And they're all tangled.  And it's, oh my God.  It's obviously, he's probably a marathon runner or something with his legs or, you know. 
[01:16:30]  No.  He's an old school guy.  That's some kind of disease.  You think it's a condition or something?  Yeah, that's a condition.  It has to be.  I'd love to slice one with a razor.  Oh my God.  Oh, ow.  Oh.  They're just pumping out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've always seen him after his work there.  But you know, he's a high, he's a powerful guy because he wears these, like these, the  two colored shirts, like the white cuff and the fucking blue.  Uh-huh.  Like the guys who always have fucking like six million dollar a year jobs wear these  sort of shirts.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right.  So he's got, whatever he is, he's got a fucking, he's probably a CEO somewhere. 
[01:17:00]  Hmm.  It's just funny.  The OCD guy I see too.  The guy who takes hours to get ready to leave.  We talked about it.  Yeah, he's not gay, I don't think.  He's just a, you know, a regular dude.  He's dressed perfectly, but he like, he primps the entire time.  Like, we'll go in the locker room, get ready, and by the time we come back an hour later,  whatever the fuck, he's still getting his, you know.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  But he's not creepy.  I've talked to him.  He's not fucking, you know, he's not seedy.  He's just...  I have never in my life wanted to spend a fraction of a second longer in a locker room 
[01:17:30]  than I have to.  We get excited now.  Right.  We get excited.  Do you?  Yeah.  When me and Jimmy walk in, we're both secretly hoping we're going to see some of the characters.  The celebrities.  The celebrities.  Yeah, the locker room celebrities.  Yeah.  Yes.  Locker room celebrities.  New bitch.  That fucking guy, when I just walk in and see him naked, it just makes me laugh every  time.  And he's always talking sports to different people.  Like, not even to just the black guy.  I'll talk to other guys about sports.  Naked. 
[01:18:00]  Totally nude.  It's wonderful.  That's some kind of fetish, yeah.  It's just wonderful.  It is.  It is.  That's a fetish.  It's wonderful.  You don't just converse naked to everybody.  No, man.  That's not something to do.  With a tiny, horrible...  If he had a giant dick, I would almost understand it like he's a show-off.  He loves the humiliation.  Yeah.  Or maybe he's gay and he wants to...  But when your cock is that small, I don't care what your orientation is, who do you want to see  that?  That's a humiliation thing, definitely.  I don't know what it is.  I'll guess who I finally saw naked by accident.  Uh-oh. 
[01:18:30]  The fucking, uh...  The black dude.  Not that...  The one who's, like, kind of, like, helped train everybody.  He's in the best shape of anybody in there.  Oh, right.  He's built like a fucking rock wall.  He's got a giant cock.  Oh, my God.  I fucking...  It was uncomfortable.  It was a half-second curse.  In your ass.  Yeah.  No.  But I just walk...  I always say hi to him.  Because, again, he's a...  He'll talk to anybody.  He'll give you training tips.  Like, he's a really nice dude.  But it was fucking uncomfortable.  Man, bingo.  Here we go.  Oh, there it is.  Making what he called a rookie mistake, that's his own admission, during his first night as 
[01:19:00]  a news anchor.  NBC North Dakota News, your news leader in high definition.  Gay.  Fucking shit.  Good evening.  I'm Van Tew.  You may have seen our newest voice, AJ, on NBC North Dakota News.  And he'll be joining the Weekend News team as my co-anchor.  Tell us a little bit about yourself, AJ.  Um, thanks, Van.  I'm very excited.  I graduated from West Virginia University.  And I'm used to, um, you know, from being from the East Coast. 
[01:19:30]  AJ is with us exclusively.  If you can't tell, he is a great sport.  Good morning to you, AJ.  Hi, AJ.  Good morning.  Thanks for having me.  I know you've seen that clip a couple of times and then about ten times just this morning  since we've been good enough to play it for you over and over again.  What did you think when you first saw it?  Uh, when I first saw the clip, it was, you know, gut-wrenching.  Uh, I didn't even know I said it on camera until my news director walked in on a third break.  So that's a long time to go without realizing that you had dropped those words. 
[01:20:00]  Go back to the beginning of the tape.  The show is coming on the air.  What were you doing?  What caused those words to come out of your mouth?  Uh, it's inexcusable first to even say those words.  Oh, good.  But I was looking down.  I'm going over my script.  Um, Van, my co-anchor, happens to be looking at the camera and she noticed the red light comes on.  We actually came on 30 seconds early.  He's got dry air.  I'm going on, uh, you know, the London Marathon is my second story. 
[01:20:30]  There is literally three names I don't know how to pronounce at all.  So you're trying to pronounce them, you're practicing them, and as you kept messing them up, you got frustrated.  Definitely.  Thinking you still had time before you were on the air, and that's when that stuff came out of your mouth.  Fireball shot came right out of my mouth.  Just so people understand, I mean, you didn't have anybody.  Fireball shot.  I just got that.  You didn't have anybody cueing you, and you didn't have an earpiece.  So for those who are just watching it, just to take them inside the moment, there's a reason you really didn't know you were on the air. 
[01:21:00]  Exactly.  I had no clue, um, no IFB, which would be an earpiece for, you know, those not in the business.  Um, no cue, no countdown, except in the master control, but we didn't have an earpiece.  I was two, um, you know, three weeks into the job, they didn't mold me for one.  Van forgot hers in the car.  You know, it was a big storm of everything that, you know, made me show.  As I think most people know by now, AJ, the station lets you go. 
[01:21:30]  And I think to tell people what kind of guy you are, you have absolutely no animosity toward the station.  Uh, no, I fully expected, you know, that they would fire me.  And I even called my news director after and, you know, apologized again.  You think they did what they had to do?  They did.  They did.  I, you know, no animosity at all.  Are you hoping someone somewhere, though, gives you a second chance?  Definitely.  Because you've got a great resume.  Definitely.  Um, I'm, you know, looking forward, moving forward. 
[01:22:00]  You've got to have a tough skin in this business.  And, you know, it's good to laugh at yourself.  And we should mention, you are a reporter.  You can shoot.  You can edit.  And we know you have a way with words.  So, if anybody's watching, we think, AJ, a second chance would be a great thing.  I just want to mention real quickly, there have been reports that you used the word gay.  That is not correct.  You were trying to pronounce the name of the winner of that marathon, which is Se-gay.  You are better at saying it than I am.  Okay.  So, I just want to make sure people don't think that's true. 
[01:22:30]  The other words were enough.  I would never use that slur.  Of course.  I definitely wanted to make sure people know that.  Yeah, I call them CS or second chances.  So, we'll give you one right now.  We normally go to commercial at this point, but AJ Clemente, take it away.  Please fuck it up.  We'll reveal People Magazine's pick for the most beautiful woman in the world.  And a new way to drink beer, a bow-tie-shaped can, right after this.  I'll buy you a beer, AJ.  Way to go.  He's terrible.  He's awful. 
[01:23:00]  He really is bad.  He's terrible.  North Dakota should rehire.  That would be the move.  Absolutely rehire him.  That would be the move.  They would get huge ratings in that fucking city.  And I like the fact, the one thing I'll say for Lauer, I like the fact that he said that  he wasn't trying to slam gay people, that he was pronouncing the name.  Right, yeah.  I like that he did that for him.  Yeah.  They treated him well.  Good.  Yeah, it was fine.  Dude, they should rehire him and go, we believe everybody deserves a second chance.  That would be a good one, yeah.  And you know what?  He has a legit case, like, none of the fucking mics being on, like, and her not having her  earpiece and him not having one. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  He'll get another job.  It's obvious.  Yeah, he'll be fine.  It's obvious.  Something we'll take a chance with.  He's just not that good.  It's a fucking small market.  He's not good.  That's what it is.  Yeah, dry mouth.  You hear that?  Yeah.  Oh.  He's really not all that good.  Dude, it was terrible.  Yeah.  His mouth was dry.  Well, there he goes.  Oh, he's a block away.  Let's get him.  Yeah.  What's he doing right now?  Yeah, he'd probably get lost on the way over.  Oh, turn it back to MSNBC.  He's going to be on there.  Yeah.  Yeah, I want to hear all his interviews.  I know. 
[01:24:00]  I want to hear he's going to say the same shit over and over.  I know.  But he's bashing the last people.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, a bunch of assholes.  That Matt Lau is a cunt.  Yeah.  Did you see that fucking, there's a video that I saw yesterday.  It's so ridiculous, but it was hilarious.  The cat in the shark suit.  What?  Sitting on a Roomba.  Yeah.  Chasing around a duckling.  It's ridiculous.  I got to see this.  Oh, he has like a.  Yeah.  Look, the cat's wearing. 
[01:24:30]  He's sitting on a Roomba chasing a duckling.  And the cat just sits on the Roomba as it drives around the floor.  It hits the wall and changes direction.  Dude, it's hilarious.  They're just walking together.  And then later on, there's a dog in a hammerhead shark suit that is sitting around with him.  Look at the cat loves it.  He just cruises around on this thing.  How cute is the duck? 
[01:25:00]  The duck is very cute.  He's just walking around.  Heading out.  What the?  I don't know.  That's adorable.  It all takes to go viral?  Yes.  That's what it takes, though.  Look at this.  It's so cute.  Yeah, that is kind of cute.  What do you put if you pull back and you see if the cat's feet are nailed to it?  It just does this the whole time.  That duck rules relatively long.  I know.  The duckling is following around the cat in the shark suit on the Roomba. 
[01:25:30]  And then, look, the dog with the hammerhead.  He doesn't look happy.  No, he feels like a dick.  Look at the cat.  The cat's not happy either.  They feel silly because they both want to kill the duck.  Yeah.  And then he ends it with them just, like, the animals just looking around in these suits.  Is that a pit bull?  It looks like it, yeah.  That looks like, yeah.  Of the blue variety.  The one that fucking Burr has. 
[01:26:00]  I don't know.  He has a blue pit bull?  Blue nose or something.  That is fucking funny.  Look at the little animals that are just hanging out.  I never knew ducks were that fucking kitchen friendly.  He's purring, and then he's got a bunch of other videos.  That's pretty cool.  Very cool.  Match the Roomba cat.  Roomba cat.  I was going to say, yeah, when we talk about these videos, you just go to our Facebook page,  Opie and Anthony.  Yes.  And you can see them.  Sure.  Indeed.  That's our visual element, I guess.  It's 1996. 
[01:26:30]  Just join our Facebook page, please.  Thank you.  By the way, finally went down to the studio, got everything re-hooked up for Life from the Compound.  What?  Did, like, a 20-minute test last night.  I didn't know either.  They're like, apparently, Ustream sends out an email when I log on live.  So I'm just testing things out.  I'm like, check, check, check.  And the phones start ringing.  People get in the chat room.  I'm like, oh, I guess I should do a few minutes.  I didn't know you were down.  Yeah.  I had stripped out a lot of the stuff from the studio. 
[01:27:00]  Why?  During the power outage.  I had to scavenge for all kinds of stuff from Superstorm Sandy.  So I threw it all back together again last night.  And it looks and sounds fucking great.  How long has it been?  Since Sandy.  Since Superstorm Sandy.  October-ish, right?  Was that October?  Wow.  You've been down six months.  That was October?  The very end of October.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Probably six months. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  All back together, though.  October-ay.  It was cool.  It took a lot of calls from fucking all over the country.  It took, like, a shitload of calls from people all over the fucking country.  It was amazing.  What are you, Scorch?  Fucking great.  Yeah, all over the country.  Did this actually happen?  Going everywhere.  Was this in your mind?  No.  I got emails.  Actually, I just fucking posted a short video on Twitter.  All right.  We're going to go back to break.  Comment?  Oh.  Did Iraq have a comment?  Iraq?  Go ahead, Iraq.  Don't be shy.  It's like you were waving.  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  I was moving to mic.  Ah. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, let's go to break, because we've got A.J. Clemente coming up on MSNBC now.  Ooh.  We'll let everyone else work for us today.  Indeed.  We'll just listen in to the interview we should have had.  Yeah.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  I can't listen to Green Day because of Anthony. 
[01:28:30]  He's got to blow his nose.  I used to like him.  Yeah, it's like, you know.  Ed fucked it up for me all day with his nasally singing.  Oh, they beeped that out, huh?  What parts do they beep out?  I don't know.  Probably a curse word.  Ugh.  Probably a curse word.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Yeah, I bought some Apple options yesterday.  You did?  Before they announced their earnings yesterday.  Right.  And then they announced earnings, and it wasn't as bad as some of the analysts thought it was 
[01:29:00]  going to be.  Right.  So it shot up $20 in aftermarket.  Wow.  And I'm like, oh, fuck.  I'm screwed because I bet it to go down.  Of course.  And then during the course of their conference call after they announced earnings, it went  back down to $2.  They lost $2 a share.  Why?  Because their conference call had nothing.  They had nothing in the pipe. 
[01:29:30]  And people are like, you know, their earnings kind of, their revenue went down this quarter,  and they have nothing that's giving anyone the impression that it's going to be better  the next quarter, or the next, or the next.  Is it this Tim Cook?  Does he just suck fucking dick?  No.  I was, me and I were having a discussion about it.  I don't even know if Steve Jobs would have been able to keep up the heat.  I think if they just, you know, they had their run.  Everyone caught up.  But there's no, you know, research and development should be pumping shit out.  Maybe Steve Jobs would have been able to, you know, keep it going a little longer, but 
[01:30:00]  I don't know, man.  They had an amazing run, and they're still making a shitload of money, by the way.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, I...  They're a very healthy company.  Huge amounts of money they're making.  But Wall Street's a little fucking sketchy on them right now.  So, they're down $10 a share in pre-market.  Ugh.  So, we'll see.  I'm going to get right the fuck out.  I'm getting right out of this fucking...  You've got a dinosaur to fucking buy, man.  I fucking...  I fucking bought the calls on Netflix yesterday, dumped the shit out of it right at the open. 
[01:30:30]  Puts on fucking Apple, dumped the shit out of it.  What dinosaur are you looking at?  Triceratops, I think.  You are, right?  Yeah, I was looking at...  How big is that?  I don't know.  It's probably the size of a pony.  No, I'm not kidding.  Did you get the tweet yesterday?  Because we get a lot of the same tweets that someone's, like, trying to say that there  was never a brontosaurus.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, they make a different...  Yeah, it's a different name.  I think the brontosaurus, the way it was portrayed years ago, the image of it is different than 
[01:31:00]  it really is.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, didn't they change that with a lot of the dinosaurs?  Yeah, they changed, like, how the tyrannosaurus looks.  They had the skeleton set up in the Museum of Natural History, standing straight up.  Right.  Like, he's just walking to the office.  Yeah, right.  And then they realized it was, like, you know, it would lean over.  Right.  And almost be flat as he's running and stuff.  So they set that up different.  What was the problem with the brontosaurus that they changed?  I think, again...  That's the one with the small head, right? 
[01:31:30]  That's the one with the small head.  The long neck.  They found hats that were too big for that small head.  And they're like, there's no way that could have been right, because they would always  find these hats by the brontosaurus.  Like, he never could have worn these.  Yes.  Fossilized hats.  They would have covered his eyes while he ate leaves.  It's a petrified hat they found.  Yeah, because there was one image on the cave wall of a brontosaurus with a hat tilted,  like a putting on the Ritz style.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, so over the course of a few years, even, since, you know, we went to school back in 
[01:32:00]  the olden days, they've kind of figured out...  Changed things around a little bit.  Yeah, changed things around.  Yeah.  Which, you know, is pretty cool, I think.  Sure.  They fucking figure new shit out.  So the mom of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects...  She's delusional, because she's the mom.  Yeah, I get it.  Obviously.  She just doesn't believe it happened.  No.  She's going to help the conspiracy guys out there.  No, she's saying, my kids wouldn't have done this. 
[01:32:30]  Right.  There's no way they did it.  It's like, yeah, you get that all the time from mothers, you know.  Right.  My child never did that.  Imagine if she said, like, what do you think?  If she's like, well, yeah, I kind of figured they were going to.  Yeah, yeah.  They seemed like real assholes when I was raising them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the car they hijacked, just an amazing story.  Oh, that guy, yeah.  They said they weren't going to kill him.  He was a Chinese fella.  Oh, yeah?  And they said they weren't going to kill him.  They needed gas. 
[01:33:00]  They stopped at a gas station.  Figured he'd kill himself driving anyway.  The one guy, I believe...  Terrible.  The one suspect went inside, I believe.  The other one was getting gas.  And the Chinese guy says, this is my chance.  And fucking ran.  He ran, huh?  Ran across the street to another gas station.  And they took off in his car.  And then, I think most people know by now, the Chinese guy left his cell phone behind.  And that's how they fucking tracked the vehicle.  Oh, they didn't let him go.  He got out.  He fucking ran.  He saw his opportunity.  He said, fuck this.  They might have killed him.  Yeah.  Oh, maybe they were.  So he's in the back seat? 
[01:33:30]  Where was he?  I don't know.  I don't know.  He jumped out and just took off.  He jumped out and said, fuck this.  And the story, they were headed for Manhattan.  That night, you think?  That's what they said.  What was in the car at that point?  I don't know.  They were probably trying to...  No, if they hijacked the car, they didn't have their shit with them.  Well, apparently, they...  Or did they?  They were throwing bombs out at the cops.  So they had something.  Yeah.  They had something.  Yeah, they said they were heading for Manhattan.  That's what the younger one has told the cops.  Wow.  What part? 
[01:34:00]  I don't know.  So they probably didn't know.  They were probably fucking winging it.  Like, let's get out of here.  Let's just go to New York and take care of this shit.  We'll hide out in New York.  Yeah.  Because, you know, New York is Brighton Beach or wherever.  There might be a place for a couple of Russian guys to hide that's not in Boston.  I don't know why they didn't leave, like, right after.  It's so stupid.  Because they were dumb.  They're fucking bung...  They really are bunglers.  Yeah.  They didn't think they'd be captured on camera.  Stupid thing.  Or if they were, they felt like their disguises were good enough.  Did they have disguises? 
[01:34:30]  They had hats on.  Well, they had hats on.  And sunglasses.  But I'm serious.  They probably looked at that as their disguise.  And they probably figured, look, you know, if we're on camera, it'll be grainy or something.  Like, they weren't thinking.  Yeah, they're pretty stupid.  You pull something off like that, you don't fucking stick around.  What, the one kid went back to his dorm?  Yeah.  Wouldn't you wear blonde wigs or fucking glasses?  Would you have a nice blonde wig?  Something, yeah.  Cute.  Yeah, why not?  You know, tease it like fucking...  Who was that fucking Van Patten actor? 
[01:35:00]  Vince?  Vince Van Patten.  Oh, Vince Van Patten.  Oh, my God.  There's a name from the past.  He hosts the poker tournaments now.  Does he?  Yeah.  What happened with the AP?  The World Poker Tour.  The AP got hacked?  Yeah, AP got hacked.  Associated Press Twitter got hacked.  It said that there were two explosions at the White House and that the president was injured.  That was the tweet.  It got taken down very quickly.  The account got suspended almost immediately. 
[01:35:30]  It was within minutes.  But the Dow dropped like 100 points in a second.  Wow.  And then after, I think, three minutes or so, they realized it was a mistake and it went right back up to where it was.  How did they realize it was a mistake?  The AP quickly tweeted, you know, we got hacked?  Yep.  Okay.  They put out a statement saying, hey, that's not true.  Wow.  That ain't true.  Wow.  Somebody made some money.  I don't know.  Dow dropping 100?  If you make a lot of money because the Dow dropped because of false news and in three minutes, you've somehow turned that into a huge amount of money, you are so getting a knock on your door. 
[01:36:00]  Right.  By a lot of people with a lot of fucking acronyms.  A lot of questions.  A lot of questions.  Will be asked.  There'll be a line of fucking government officials there to ask you what shenanigans you were up to.  Absolutery.  He rocks a dinosaur.  He rocks a dinosaur.  March.  He rocks a dinosaur. 
[01:36:30]  Marching.  Marching.  He rocks a dinosaur.  How did he get so fast?  So fast.  He rocks a dinosaur.  He rocks a dinosaur.  He rocks a dinosaur.  Marching.  Marching.  Marching.  Marching.  Wake up, little piggy boy and fucking take us out.  How did he get so fast?  I love when he goes, wake up, little piggy boy.  Piggy boy.  He pops in the mic. 
[01:37:00]  I love that one.  Little piggy boy.  He's a dinosaur.  Marching.  I do that around the house.  That's fucking the greatest song ever.  There are so many things that I look like.  Oh, there he is.  Hold on.  It's like a complete retard.  What the s***?  But first, here's Bill Karens with the f***ing forecast, Bill.  Come on.  You know, let's have a little class here on this show.  Right, AJ?  You did it right.  Must be some misunderstanding.  Can you help me with the Norfolk forecast, by the way?  Cold and snow on the ground. 
[01:37:30]  Norfolk.  Well, let's get to what the weather is out there today.  I got what he said.  Good news for the East Coast and also, by the way, in the Northern Plains.  I have some good news.  We have to wait for yours probably through the weekend.  So here's what we're looking at.  Which is firm grip over the middle of the country.  It's been an April of unbelievable snow and cold all the way from Denver through Minneapolis.  And look at the temperatures this morning.  People in Dallas are walking.  I kind of like this one.  What's going on?  That is way, way cold by Dallas standards at 37 at this hour, 27 in Denver.  Now, the East Coast is warming up, by the way. 
[01:38:00]  There's a cold front that slices through the Ohio Valley.  So bring your umbrella this morning from Indiana all the way back to Ohio, Kentucky,  and some portions there of Tennessee, including Nashville.  And look at the forecast today.  This is what we've been waiting for.  The wind shift.  Warm air shoots up the East Coast.  So that's going to be beautiful.  It's about time.  We waited long enough.  74 in New York today.  And the cold air remains there.  There in the northern plain.  But as I mentioned, there is some good news.  Minneapolis, by the weekend, temperatures in the mid-70s, melting the snow finally, as you can get into the good news of spring also. 
[01:38:30]  Leaving you with a shot of the White House.  Beautiful day in D.C.  Lunch outdoors.  If you can get away with it, you're watching Morning Joe Brewed by Starbuck.  That's distracting me, the music.  They like their music.  I don't miss the music.  Hey, you know, they had fun with it.  I mean, I'm not a big fan of that Mika.  Yes.  But she was all in on the bit cursing.  Mika.  Yeah.  Oh, she probably fucking, she's like that off the air, I bet, constantly.  I know.  Just yelling, cursing at the men. 
[01:39:00]  She probably doesn't like to say the F word, because every time she says fuck, she's tempted to say me with a black cock after it.  Wow.  Jesus.  What's wrong with that?  Nothing.  She wants to get fucked with a black cock.  Good for her.  I applaud her.  Good for her.  I applaud her.  So the AP, yeah.  So they fixed that.  Yeah.  Who do you think did it?  They said some kind of a Syrian outfit.  Yeah.  Really?  Syrian outfit.  Bill Cox. 
[01:39:30]  Wearing over Bill Cox's outfit.  Bill Cox's outfit.  Like, it's a fucking shed with greasy fucking lawnmower parts in it.  Bill Cox's outfit, making it sound like it's IBM.  That's in my head now.  But there must be some, it's on the stand.  He is a dinosaur, marching, marching. 
[01:40:00]  He is a dinosaur, how did he get so fan-fed?  He is a dinosaur, marching, marching.  Wake up, little piggy boy, and fucking take us out.  Out.  I think a lot of us know Sax God on Twitter.  He's just constantly in denial and has blinders on.  He writes, what made me think he was innocent was the youngest went back to his life and acted  shocked with everyone else. 
[01:40:30]  Dummies.  We're being called dummies.  There's no, oh God.  Wait, is he calling us dummies or them?  Huh?  Is he calling us dummies or them?  I think this is what he believes.  That's how I read it.  That he's innocent.  What made me think he was innocent was the youngest went back to his life and capitals,  all that, and acted shocked with everyone else.  Dummies.  Ah, please.  What a load of shit.  What was the kid supposed to do?  Yeah.  What was he supposed to do?  He's a dummy.  They didn't, of course they acted shocked. 
[01:41:00]  They didn't know, they just didn't understand how captured they were with video.  They, and stuff.  They just didn't see that.  So that's why they went back to their normal, they didn't want to get caught.  No.  But they would have suicide bombed.  They would have stood there with machine guns.  They did not want to get caught.  No.  They just did not understand how, yeah, I know that guy, you mean.  What's his name?  Abu or?  Sax God.  Sax God.  Yeah.  He's all in.  He's a good fan, but he's too, he's so slanted.  He's so worried about protecting Islam's image that whenever something comes up that's legit, 
[01:41:30]  he kind of goes to the window.  That's how Muslims are.  That's how, like, black guys are on the fucking Twitter.  They just have to protect their own people.  It's ridiculous.  Well, Sax God, call the show.  Yeah.  We know you're a fan.  Then he writes, no, I'm a dummy.  What do you mean?  What?  Call the show.  We can't have a discussion on Twitter.  Uh-oh, who's on the phones, though? 
[01:42:00]  You might, who's on the phones, you might take the call, not know who it is, and then  have to alert Roland and E-Rock.  The way he was trying to worm out of that on the after show yesterday, he wouldn't even  take responsibility for the fact that he couldn't handle the phones yesterday.  Right.  He couldn't handle a phone call.  He'll hear from somebody else that it wasn't just a caller, or that the hotline rings and  he lost his mind.  Right.  And then after the show, I talked to the guy who called that freaked out Sal, and he 
[01:42:30]  was just laughing about how simple, simple, simple the call was.  Oh, so who is this?  What is this pertaining to?  Oh, Roland?  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, if I can, you know, take your number down and get it to Roland.  Thank you.  Oh, E-Rock.  Roland, help.  Good evening, I'm Van Chew.  You may have seen our newest, AJ, on NBC North Dakota News, and he'll be joining the Weekend  News team as my co-anchor.  Wow.  It's just different styles.  Oh, it's just different. 
[01:43:00]  Wow.  Oh, my gosh.  Joining us now, former, former North Dakota News anchor, AJ Clemente.  Yes, I think it's appropriate that you're here, Tom.  AJ, listen, before I got to the Berlin Wall, before I got to Kuwait, before I got to all  those international hotspots, I was where you were.  I worked out in the Midwest.  I made a huge gap when I was in Omaha at a very early age.  I said, it wasn't quite as explicit as yours was by any means.  On the other hand, it was confined to Omaha because there was no social media. 
[01:43:30]  It was dealt with by the local city.  Right.  They made me come in and kind of gave me a dressing down, but I got to go on with my life.  You're the victim of a hot mic, obviously, and also nothing goes unremarked upon in our  current society.  Suddenly, you go from being a rookie anchor in Bismarck to someone who's sitting on the  set of morning show.  Well, you come to the right place, actually.  Yeah, right, right, exactly.  Because Tom gave me the same talk after I made a mistake. 
[01:44:00]  Right.  There was an F-bomb you dropped, but it seemed to work for you.  Every microphone is hot.  That's what you always have to remember.  That's what Tom told me.  So you actually said, you've seen this clip more today than you have since this happened,  because after this happened, you went home and crawled under your bed in a fetal position.  That's exactly what I did.  I think I watched it twice.  I think I've seen it 20 times today, and each time it's more heartbreaking, and you've got 
[01:44:30]  to be able to laugh at yourself.  You definitely need to laugh, because it's funny at this point.  But let me ask you this.  What was the, was it nerves?  Was it your first moment on the air?  Because that's what I felt when I was watching it.  It was not, the video makes it look like that.  It was a perfect storm of so much, and me looking down.  We came on 30 seconds early, no audio, no IFB.  The massacre was counting down, but the audio was turned down, and I didn't have an IB. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, welcome to the television business.  The first day I was at MSNBC, now years ago, somebody came up to me and said, the most  important guy here, Scarborough, the sound guy.  I go, what?  I go, the most important guy here, the sound guy, because he or she, Mike, if they don't  take care of you, you don't have a job.  No, I mean, you know, I've been home for 20 years, you know, sitting in the cellar without  the sound people taking care of me. 
[01:45:30]  But, AJ, let me ask you, I assume your life flashed before your eyes, you know, in the  instance after that happened.  I didn't, oh, go ahead.  Well, let me tell you the story of when I was fucking somebody's shine in New Orleans.  The day it happened, I didn't even realize I said it on air.  The third break, my news director comes in and says, you have to apologize.  And everybody says, for what?  And, you know, I know now that I'm going to be able to work, but that day, like he said, 
[01:46:00]  I literally went home, called my mom, and that was it.  Well, have you ever heard of this program way too early?  Yeah.  It's on at 5.30 a.m., 5.30 to 6.  You know, I mean, he could help us out there.  Yeah.  So what did your mother say?  She didn't say much.  I was doing most of the talking, but now she's been very supportive.  I, I'm sorry to everybody, and I'm mostly sorry to her. 
[01:46:30]  She didn't raise me that way to even speak like that.  Oh, stop it.  You're a liar, liar, pants on fire.  Let's have you read a new script right here, okay?  They got a reading.  And try not to curse.  All right.  I'll keep you.  Okay?  A-jo-3-2-1-Q.  After holding two separate.  Holding?  Dinner's time.  Dinner's time.  Dinner's time.  Dinner's time for the public over the past few weeks.  Last night, President Obama hosted a bipartisan group of females centered at the White House.  Okay.  Keep going. 
[01:47:00]  Okay.  I have my glasses on.  He doesn't have his glasses on.  Don't worry.  We're good.  All good at this.  What is it?  Are we doing a tryout?  He's terrible.  He's terrible.  He's terrible.  He's in front of Tom Brokaw.  But I'm blind.  Yeah.  So, so, so.  Don't cut your day job.  Actually, it's something had gone terribly wrong.  You're a loser.  Which, actually, if you saw Anchorman, he actually got through the entire show before he saw it. 
[01:47:30]  Top out.  Could you relate to Ron Burgundy?  I already got tweets saying cameo for Anchorman 2.  Who said that?  Oh, man.  I definitely can relate.  That won't date the movie at all after a few months.  Yeah.  Like I said, I'm really sorry.  All right, AJ.  Thank you so much.  Stop apologizing.  We greatly appreciate you having me.  Everyone uses that word.  Hey, you got Tom Brokaw.  I know.  I didn't even know.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Listen, I want to tell you very quickly. 
[01:48:00]  Fifteen-year-old newscast on a radio station after basketball practice, Yanky, South Dakota.  First newscast.  Governor Joe Foss today addressed the Convention of the Veterans of the Foreign Wars.  Uh, wars.  Foreign wars.  It's happened to everybody.  It's happened to you.  I said they're tapes, and if you...  Tom said wars, huh?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Don't refer to the state.  Don't find it.  Okay, that's true.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Would you say there's some tapes of you that would finish your career?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, and...  I can't say anything.  Oh, yeah.  But I've... 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, we all have our moments.  The first one, though, is always the most...  Do we have the Tom Brokaw tax cut?  Yeah, we should play that.  Your wife...  You got that, Iraq?  Yes.  It does.  Because it's the one time you get rewarded for your mother...  Wrap it up!  Wrap it up!  Wrap it up!  It's good to have you on AJ.  Thank you so much, AJ.  Mika, why don't you do something constructive with that mouth and wrap her up my cock?  You still got the Brokaw in you.  You still have it. 
[01:49:00]  It's very rare you see him on TV.  No, it sucks he's not on TV anymore.  The media is weird.  The media really empathizes with this guy, and they're going out of their way to help him out.  Because he's one of, you know, he's kind of in there.  And they've all had that happen on some level.  As soon as they realize he wasn't saying gay, as in gay.  Right, right.  That helped them out a lot.  It was the marathoner's name.  Yeah.  I just wish they would be this generous when comedians say something.  Oh, no kidding.  Oh, yeah.  I wish they would go out of their way to help explain the motives. 
[01:49:30]  And I know it's different, but it's just, it makes me like the media more and hate their guts in the same moment.  Like, I like the way they're handling this guy, though.  Yeah, we got the Brokaw.  Brokaw was worse than this guy, if you ask me.  The key component, and what the president insists, is the job stimulus program.  Ohio, a strong Republican state, is hurting economically.  And as NBC's David Gregory reports tonight, the president took his message right to a powerful Ohio Republican who is not convinced the tax cunts are the answer. 
[01:50:00]  Not convinced the tax cunts are the answer.  It's not even close to cunts.  You can't tax ladies' cunts.  Tax cunts.  Yeah.  That's it.  He sounds exhausted when he tries to talk.  Yeah, fucking, like, he's out of breath all the time.  He must love seeing that period come up.  Oh, God.  Looks like he runs out of air or something. 
[01:50:30]  I love a good punctuation.  I can't really talk for a long period of time with this type of list because I run out of oxygen.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I've been to the Berlin Wall.  I watched as the Achilles Loro was hijacked and Leon Klinghoffer was thrown over the side.  He has every sentence.  The last gasp. 
[01:51:00]  I just throw that last bit out of his lungs.  And, of course, September 11th, September 11th, when al-Qaeda and his Taliban and Osama bin Laden  bombed the World Trade Center, bringing down an iconic building.  I'm coughing now. 
[01:51:30]  I made myself cough.  Oh, oh, Chippa?  Yeah, it's Tom Brokaw.  I can't say my L's and buttons.  So when I see lollipops, I'm like, look at the fucking ollie-ops.  You said L.  You said ollie.  We got sex got online.  That's an L.  Sex.  I didn't understand your tweets.  Are you making fun of conspiracy guys?  Or do you believe this whole fucking Boston Marathon bombing thing is a conspiracy? 
[01:52:00]  No, what I thought at the very beginning, I gave the guy the benefit of the doubt  because he was the only one in the group that was a U.S. citizen.  That, you know, all of his friends were very shocked by it.  But I figured what made me really question was how he went back to his life  and acted like, you know, he was shocked that, you know, that he was amazed that there was a bombing  and he couldn't believe it happened.  And then all of a sudden, you know, I thought he would be a psychopath then if he was able to, you know, act like that. 
[01:52:30]  But in reality, he was responsible for all that.  And then when it turns out he really is responsible, then one, makes me a dummy for falling for it.  And then two, you know, makes him a dummy for not running when he had the chance.  It's a little harder when you've got a little more than 140 characters to work with, isn't it?  Yeah.  I mean, it's a bit strange, sure.  But, I mean, he was being led around by his brother.  That's pretty obvious.  His brother was influencing him. 
[01:53:00]  That's going to be the entire case.  But he certainly went along with it.  You know, he could have said no any time but decided not to.  Right.  And then he puts a bullet in his mouth and now he can't speak.  And, you know, like Jimmy says, you hope he can never talk again, which would be kind of funny.  He's in fair condition.  He's going to be released soon, you know.  You think?  He's already down to fair condition, yeah.  You think he'll make bail?  Imagine.  Yeah, there's some definite strange things in there, but. 
[01:53:30]  Right.  It's a very tricky situation.  Yes.  Well, I think you and Jimmy at Tweet apologize for being wrong.  Yesterday, so.  No, it's fine.  It's just fine.  Anyway.  I didn't even read your tweet.  So, not you a dummy.  I can't read every tweet that comes in.  Oh, you little sweetie.  All right, Saks God.  Thanks for explaining, at least.  You're welcome.  Good luck in Austin, Jimmy.  Thank you, brother.  This Saturday.  Oh, is it?  This Saturday. 
[01:54:00]  In Austin, Texas.  Sold out.  Could you call it Tex-a-roo?  Yep.  I mentioned sold out.  I thought you were mad yesterday.  Mad why?  You were like, well, here I come.  You asked me to go to Austin, and here I am.  You were talking like maybe ticket sales were a little low or something.  They are low.  I just lied.  I'm a good actor.  It's not sold out.  Oh, Jimmy.  There's plenty available.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[01:54:30]  You're getting way better, man.  Holy fuck.  Oh, I just wanted to see what that felt like to say.  It's fun.  I saw Jimmy on Jesselneck last night.  Oh, did you see it?  Yes, it was very fucking funny.  Thank you.  That was a good bit, man.  There's some little kid in a classroom, and he's supposedly the bully, and they're kind  of giving him lessons on bullying, and they bring in these geeky kids and just proceed  to lambast of horribly awful things you're saying. 
[01:55:00]  So the point of the bit was basically that me and Anthony were helping the bully to realize  the error of his ways by going, like, if a girl walked in, like, you don't want to  say to this girl, blah, blah, blah.  Like, you don't want to look at her and go.  So basically, we just shit on these little kids.  Oh, that's great.  And one was a fucking, some geeky-looking Asian girl with glasses, and she comes walking  in and stands there, and I think, yeah, it was Anthony.  He said, hey, I'm not good enough at math, but I'm not as good as you.  Oh, fuck. 
[01:55:30]  I'm not as good at math as you are, but I'm good enough to know you're a three.  It was fucking brutal.  Terrible.  And there was one he said that was fucking hilarious, but they couldn't use it.  It was just too rough.  Oh, was it?  He said something about, which one was it?  It was like the chubby emo kid.  Oh, yeah.  And he said, what's stopping you from shooting up your school besides the steps?  That's a good one.  And they made him take that out, but it was really funny.  Jimmy had a good.  Suicide.  Jimmy had a good line where they had the fat band girl holding the tuba. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  And Jim goes, if you lost 10 pounds, black guys will like you.  I was surprised they put that one.  Did they show the kid in the wheelchair?  I don't know.  Let's watch it.  No.  I don't know.  Oh, you don't know?  Wait, did you watch this clip or the actual show?  I watched the actual show.  Oh, maybe they cut that out.  Maybe they'll have some time.  I watched the show on the TV.  You're very big on the 90-inch TV.  Oh, man.  Your head was huge.  It was great.  All right.  Well, they're pretty fine, that clip.  I want to see it.  Yeah, that was pretty goddamn funny. 
[01:56:30]  They asked me if I was going to be in L.A. because Anthony wanted to bring me out to introduce  the clip.  But they just, you know, I wasn't out there.  And a lot of people are Twittering and going, how come we didn't have you on panel?  Anthony even explained.  The reason they didn't, and he would, is because the first year they're trying to avoid, with  the exception, I think, of Amy, and she's got a show on, is that they don't want to have  the same people that The Burn had because they're trying to be a different show.  So I understand that.  They're just using different guests.  Right.  It was fucking fun, man.  I couldn't believe some of the lines they left in. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, my God.  I know.  It was really funny.  The band girl.  Yeah, she was kind of chubby.  And then the emo kid, he's, you know, all dark, and you guys are just beating the shit  out of them.  Yeah, on my Facebook page.  Go to my fan book, my fan page.  I was very surprised because it was with kids.  And you got to be careful what you say in front of kids.  Your fucking Facebook.  Oh, you like that?  I've seen it many times.  Your picture on Facebook is hilarious.  This is a quick ad.  Oh. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, no, there's not.  This study from Duke University shows that there's a link between childhood bullying  and psychological disorders later in life.  The study was conducted by tracking both bullies from adolescence to adulthood and bullying  victims from childhood to the suicide.  That's a rough fucking joke there.  Really?  Getting edgier on Comedy Central, huh?  We never talk to you if you're too sensitive to make a joke about it.  Last few years.  We make a bunch of jokes about it in a segment we call Sacred Cow.  This week, we chose bullying. 
[01:58:00]  Now, bullying is such a sensitive topic that I needed help this week.  And who better to lend me a hand than the most gentle soul of all, Jim Norton.  Jimmy.  Norton and I sat down with a young bully and tried to get him to change his ways the only  way we know how, by being dicks.  Check it out.  Wow.  So, DJ, you know why you're here.  Yeah?  You're a bully.  Yes.  You ever get in trouble for bullying?  Oh, yeah.  And what's your punishment? 
[01:58:30]  Uh, suspension.  That happens a lot.  You want us to help you stop it?  Yeah.  All right.  You've got a couple more years before you get out of school.  So, we need to make sure you can control yourself right now.  Okay.  We're going to bring in some really pathetic, easy targets and see how well you can control  yourself.  Now, let's have our first nerd come on in here.  Jesus.  Band girl.  No.  You don't look at her and just really want to say, marching band, huh?  Why don't you join jogging band? 
[01:59:00]  You don't think it would be fun to yell, hey, look, a fat girl with a popcorn bucket  on her head.  Jesus.  You don't want to say, hey, do you play scales or just crush them?  You're not tempted to tell her, hey, cheer up.  If you lose 10 pounds, black guys will like you.  You want to do that?  Next.  But she's really fat.  Yes.  It would be to say, hey, look, it's Sharon Osbourne in 1991.  You like it.  Look, it's the cure.  Teen pregnancy.  Hey, don't feel bad.  If none of the girls in your high school will ban you, there's always Comic-Con. 
[01:59:30]  Next.  Now, look at this nerd.  You don't want to tell this girl, hey, you can be whatever you want when you get older,  except for a model or a good driver.  Hey, I know I'm not as good as math at you, but I can tell that you're a three.  Jesus.  Hey, cheer up.  In a few years, your mother will really show you what to do with a ping pong ball.  You don't want to say, hey, congratulations on not being drowned at birth when your parents  realized you were a girl.  That doesn't appeal to you?  I don't know.  Pretty good job today.  What'd you learn?  Your show sucks. 
[02:00:00]  What was that?  You know what it was.  Wow.  That's so funny.  That's fucking funny.  Good for Jizzelnick.  Getting away with some shit.  Yeah.  Wow.  You said that fucking, you were almost drowned at birth.  I was.  You're a girl.  That was brutal.  Yeah, that is terrible.  Right on, man.  Very funny.  We got to take a break.  I think we're going to talk to Chael Sonnen next.  Yes, he's hopefully coming to the pool.  When's the big fight? 
[02:00:30]  This weekend, right?  It is Saturday night.  Chael, and I'm so heartbroken, I can't go into this because of my dumb gig, but Chael  and John Jones.  It is in New Jersey.  It's UFC 159.  And it's at the Prudential Center.  There might be tickets available.  I'm not sure.  But, you know, it's this Saturday.  And fuck do I want to be there for this fight.  So, you know, they were the two UFC ultimate fighter coaches, and as a rule, they fight at  the end of it.  Right.  It's going to be a great fight. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  All right.  We'll talk to Chael next.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Chael Sonnen should be in studio in a few minutes.  Big fight with John Jones this weekend.  Who do you think is going to win that thing?  There's a problem between them, too.  I'd just say, man, I mean, Jones is a fucking, is just, if he looks unbeatable. 
[02:01:30]  Right.  But Chael really has a knack for freaking these people out because, like, when I say these  people, I mean these guys who look like they're unbeatable.  Because after what he did to Anderson Silva in that first fight, no one can take Chael  lightly.  Right.  Because that was a five-round.  Chael's intimidating, too, as a person.  Most of these guys aren't that intimidating.  They're, you know, they're really just nice guys when they're not beating the shit out of  each other.  Chael's a bit intimidating.  Yeah.  I think he's just, I don't know what's going to happen. 
[02:02:00]  I think he'll be very aggressive, and he'll try to, I mean, he's not going to say what  he's going to do, obviously.  I think it's going to be a great fight.  I hope so.  I'm so fucking annoyed.  Who else is fighting Saturday?  I don't know.  I actually don't know.  I haven't even thought about this one, because I'm not going to be able to go to it.  Look at Alan Alda having a great time on MSNBC.  Yeah.  We try to get him?  We try to get him.  I've been fucking screaming how much I love Alan Alda for years.  Hawkeye Pierce.  He's one of your top guys, right?  One of my favorite people ever to exist.  And Roland said, his rep said, well, he doesn't do anything before 11, so he's doing Unmasked 
[02:02:30]  today at 1130, so I'm going to watch him Unmasked.  So that's good for us.  It'll be on our channel.  Yeah.  Ronnie's doing Unmasked with Alan Alda today.  When is that going to air?  Do not know.  What's the turnaround time on the Unmasked?  About a week or so?  I mean, they've done things where they've aired them the next day, sometimes it's a week,  yeah.  All right.  So very soon you'll hear Alan Alda and Ronnie B.  But it's 8 fucking 840, and he's on TV.  Yeah.  I thought he didn't do anything before 11.  Why can't they just tell us no?  Yeah.  Why do they have to lie to us?  Say, he said no.  And then we catch them in their lies. 
[02:03:00]  Don Cheadle's going to be here Friday at 10 a.m.  Don Cheadle.  And he won't, or his rep won't let him do the show.  That's not fair.  We had Don Cheadle on.  That's not fair.  That's what I'm saying.  You're not being fair.  We can't get him back in.  We had Don Cheadle on.  It was great.  Yeah.  It was a doorway interview, but we had him on.  He had a good time.  He came in for like 10 minutes, and we had some laughs.  Oh, wait.  He actually sat down?  Yeah.  You're thinking of someone.  Don Cheadle came in and sat down, and they're like, who is Jim Norton?  They're getting all these tweets about him.  Oh, right.  So what's the problem?  We treated him nice.  I don't know if it's him or if it's his rep, but he comes in at 10. 
[02:03:30]  That's too bad.  I'm like, why can't he come in 15 minutes early?  We love this guy.  I love him.  I would never fuck with Don Cheadle.  That's too bad.  The greatest.  Yes.  So there's a couple guys I'm dying to talk to that we just can't get booked, and it's like,  we're not going to do anything stupid.  Didn't we lose a MASH guy?  Alan Arbus.  Yeah, man.  Alan Arbus died.  Sidney Friedman.  He made it to 95, though.  Wow.  95.  He was, toward the end of MASH, he was 65 years old. 
[02:04:00]  That's unbelievable to me.  He didn't look 65 on the show.  No.  Not at all.  And he wasn't really in the, he wasn't in the earlier episodes, was he?  Yeah.  I mean, he was like one of the stars of the big finale.  Yeah, yeah.  But his final line was something about, something, if you want my advice, just pull down your  pants and slide on the ice.  Right.  I don't know how I remember that.  Ladies and gentlemen, take my advice.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Fucking Iraq's correct in Jim Norton, it sounds like.  Where'd you read that?  That was his MASH trivia.  I was a big MASH fan.  Oh, you are?  Okay. 
[02:04:30]  Potatoes?  Do you like Alan Alda?  Love Alan Alda.  Do you really, you are?  He was great in Aviator, too.  What?  What were we?  Aviator.  Aviator, Aviator, whatever.  Aviator?  Aviator.  What?  Aviator.  Hey, what is, what is Aventure?  Aventure.  I don't like Alan Alda.  He's hockey.  Fucking bummed.  Well, we're waiting for Chelsea.  What are you going to have him sign?  He hates signing MASH. 
[02:05:00]  I just want a photo.  Does he?  Yeah.  I heard that, too, that he doesn't like signing anything MASH.  What's wrong with him?  He's like, you're sick of this story for fucking 40 years.  What the hell?  I want to get, uh, well, the only thing I want to get him to sign is one of those little  unmasked things that you, can I have Newhart signed one?  Yeah.  Oh, the little laminates.  Yeah, that's it.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  I'm just going to hand it to him.  Sign this shit!  Whoa.  He might not like that.  Yeah, he will.  He'll get it.  I can't believe fucking Morning Joe gets Alan Alda.  He was in 12 episodes from 73 to 83. 
[02:05:30]  Wow.  You remember when fucking Hawkeye?  I think he was, uh...  That was it?  That's it.  12 episodes.  It seems like he was in more.  I don't...  Wow.  He was a big character, too.  Everyone knew Sidney.  He was referenced a lot, too.  Right.  But, uh...  You know, my cousin, he helped me in the water.  With all of those having this fucking itching.  Yes.  Commotion outside the studio. 
[02:06:00]  Commotion outside the studio.  Commotion?  Hmm?  Locomotion?  Uh-huh.  Rolling.  Walk by.  Oh, more commotion outside the studio.  Does this mean a guest?  It looks like it.  Uh-oh.  There's Chal.  Chal Sonnen.  Holy fuck.  Come on in.  He's coming right in.  Chal Sonnen.  Fighting Jon Jones this weekend.  UFC 159.  Come on in.  Sure.  Chal looks in shape.  Take a seat.  Hey, Chal.  How you been, man? 
[02:06:30]  Welcome back to the show.  Thank you, brother.  You look great to fight.  Jesus Christ.  You know the deal now?  I know when I walk in here, we're live.  Yeah, exactly.  I thought we were just a couple of guys visiting.  What is this?  Jimmy Hart's in here?  You got a megaphone?  A megaphone.  What are you guys doing in that?  Campaigning amongst each other?  Ladies and gentlemen.  Trust me, he does some real good.  When you have the top radio show in America like you gentlemen do, I don't think you need  a megaphone.  You're just talking to this and everybody hears it.  He does wonderful things with the megaphone.  You'd be very surprised. 
[02:07:00]  It might seem hack, but not when it's using it.  Two consenting New Yorkers.  I'm on an airplane.  It's like, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for flying.  See?  And then a phone call.  Hi, you're on the air.  Hi, I'm one of your stupid listeners.  I don't have nothing to the show.  You know, so it comes in handy.  It does.  Why, thank you.  You're welcome.  Are you ready?  You guys finally done something for me for a chance.  I know, right?  Look at a little water.  Look at them guns.  She's so good about that. 
[02:07:30]  You ready for Saturday or what, child?  I'm ready to go.  I'm ready for a second.  Absolutely.  Been ready for a while.  Now, last time you were in here, you and Jon Jones were like best of pals.  Yeah.  He turned out to be a pretty nice guy.  And you were surprised by that.  There wasn't a lot I can do about that.  I don't manufacture conflict.  I can't just come out and say he was a jerk if he wasn't.  Right.  Turned out to be a good guy.  What are you drinking over there, grass?  Not all of us can look like you, Chael.  It's vegetables.  Stop.  We got some beets. 
[02:08:00]  We got some carrots.  We got some orange.  No wonder it's three quarters full.  I wouldn't drink that crap either.  It's not that bad, actually.  The lemon and the apple makes it palatable.  A couple of in-shape guys talking.  You better not have apple.  I asked you what's in there, then I rudely cut you.  Do you put kale in there?  Kale is rough, but I do shove it down.  People are drinking that.  I drink the kale, but that's a rough one.  My friend Leah drinks that crap.  I tease her all the time.  Why are you drinking?  Kale is rough.  You want to eat kale?  Why would you want to drink it?  Yeah, yeah.  Now, you don't drink anything like that, right?  No, I don't.  So, oh, look. 
[02:08:30]  You drink it to stay in shape.  Look at him.  He's in such good shape, and he doesn't have to deal with that shit.  You know what I would look like if I didn't fucking drink the vegetable juice?  But good for you.  A lot more sure.  Good for you.  You know, if you do enjoy it and you've got away.  I don't enjoy it.  Did you do that yourself?  It looks like.  Did you bring that from home, or you bought that?  No, no.  We get it.  Yeah.  They go out and get it for us.  There you go.  Well, you don't have to be a prick about it.  You're trying to be a man of the people up here, you know.  No, we brought it to me after I got out of my limbo.  No, no, no, no, no. 
[02:09:00]  We're not like that.  I would think that you would drink stuff like this all the time, but what do you mostly  eat and drink?  Because you're healthy on all of us.  Well, see, that's very nice of you guys to say.  I'm a Dolce Diet guy, so I guess now I get to be the snob, too.  He brings it to me, as well.  He makes it in the morning.  What is Dolce Diet guy?  Dolce Diet is one of the biggest diets in the country.  He wrote a couple of books.  He's a former fighter.  He's one of Dana White's right-hand guys.  Can you eat chocolate?  Yeah, you can, but in sparingly. 
[02:09:30]  But yeah.  Nice.  Sparingly.  Thank you very much.  It's a big word.  A little dark chocolate you throw in there?  Hey, you want to know something?  Speaking of that, Snickers just came out with a dark chocolate Snickers.  Saw it yesterday for the first time.  I haven't tried it yet.  That sounds pretty good.  I don't like milk chocolate anymore, ever since I discovered dark chocolate years ago.  Dark's excellent.  It's the way it's got it.  A lot of people are still discovering it.  I know.  You go to Whole Foods, and they've got a whole fucking aisle now that has just so many different  varieties of dark chocolate.  Yeah, some of that's bitter, though.  You know, at Whole Foods, you've got to be careful. 
[02:10:00]  You can't go too bitter there, Chad.  Yeah, I agree with you.  You've got to go around 70%.  I agree.  See, I know this.  I know dark chocolate as well.  That's all my dad ate.  No, the other question I had, are you still getting along with Jon Jones?  Yeah, you know what?  Well, that sucks.  Yeah, I totally agree, and I'm not happy about it, and it doesn't help things when you're  going to go fight, but, I mean, it's just the reality.  I was with him yesterday.  He was a funny guy.  He did a little robot dance on ESPN.  I got a kick out of it.  I mean, it doesn't change anything.  You've got to understand, I'm a wrestler. 
[02:10:30]  I grew up wrestling.  I would work out with guys every day, and then on Saturday, we'd have to slap hands and  get it on for the championship.  So you'd just turn that shit off, obviously, when it's kind of fight.  Yeah, it's just competition.  Yeah, I'm not going to, by any means, hold back.  We are so conditioned that if you're fighting, you've got to hate the guy that you're fighting,  because if we're fighting, it's because somebody fucked you up.  And then after the fight, you continue to hate.  It's a sport.  Because you look at what he did to you, or you did to him, whatever. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, it's a competition.  It's a sport.  I get that.  I used to look at it the same way, and I prefer to still.  Yeah.  And there's a lot of dirtbags out there, but every now and then you run into a guy  that's not, or that you think, yeah, that's a nice enough guy, and that's just what happened  with John.  But it's not going to change anything.  Look, there can only be one champion, and we're going to figure this out the hard way.  He's still going to try to beat his face in.  Is it harder to put weight on?  I know it's easier to gain weight than lose it, but is it harder to move up in weight  and fight a stronger guy than you fought? 
[02:11:30]  You know, I don't really know.  I haven't gained any weight.  I weighed about 230 when I would cut down to 185, and this was my first time at 205,  but I still weigh 230.  I've got to go down to 205.  So I only have to lose 20 pounds less, but I didn't actually gain anything this morning.  I just weighed in before I came here.  I'm 217 right now.  The weigh-ins are in two days.  The 205 will be the limit.  You can get 12 pounds off in two days pretty easily?  Yeah, I could get 12 pounds off in just over two hours.  Come on.  Yeah, I can lose about six and a half pounds an hour. 
[02:12:00]  Wait, you've got to explain that.  How do you do that?  Well, there's a lot of tactics.  I don't know that I could explain it quickly, but, I mean, I've been at this since I was nine years old.  And I'm not the only guy.  Yeah, in fact, that would be a small cut.  Being 12 pounds over would be a small cut.  My opponent, John, is about 225 right now.  He'll have to get more off.  Do you remove all your duty?  Do you shit first is a good question, actually, before you weigh in.  If you can shit before we weigh in, it's...  And then maybe an enema or something to get rid of all the duty. 
[02:12:30]  That's disgusting.  Sorry.  Because I remember in high school, the wrestling guys, they would, you know, put the bags on or whatever, the bag outfits, and fucking just sweat their balls off.  How much of it is water and how much of it is, like, it's all water that you're losing in.  So you're extremely dehydrated when you're weighing in.  When I say I could take 12 pounds off in two hours, I could put 12 pounds right back on in two hours.  Right, right.  And it's just water.  So when you're done with that, because I saw you when you fought your last silver fight, and I was just in the area, and you were just shoveling in fruit right after the weigh-in. 
[02:13:00]  Right.  Like, just put your hand back in fresh fruit.  Yeah, you told that story.  Fresh fruit.  Yeah.  And I hate that, you know.  French fries.  I want French fries after the weigh-in.  I want a Coca-Cola big enough to swim in.  And Dolce brought me fruit.  He double-crossed me.  Ah, my God.  They want the healthy shit the night before the weigh-in.  Yeah.  How much water is 12 pounds of water?  That would be a gallon and a half.  So a milk jug and then another half.  It's a gallon and a half of liquid that you're removing from your body. 
[02:13:30]  And liquid is very essential to the human body.  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, it is.  But that's just, I mean, you know, you could lose more than that.  Like I said, my opponent will have to pull about 20 out, which is just under three gallons.  But basically, how do you do that?  You sit in a sauna or something?  Because you can't work out, because now you're tiring your body out.  Yeah, I mean, everybody's got their own tricks and secrets that they do.  Oh, so you don't really talk about how you do it.  I got you.  It's a big deal.  You know, losing weight is very hard, especially when you've got to be in the ring less than 24 hours later.  So how guys do it, they usually keep to themselves. 
[02:14:00]  But you could use a sauna.  That would be kind of the barbarian way to do it, the prehistoric way.  But, I mean, I grew up doing that.  That's all we knew.  But there's now better ways.  Yeah, I don't want to talk about that.  I've seen how some of those things work based on cartoons I watch.  There's a big square box, right?  And the cartoon character, whoever it will be, goes in there, and there's a little hole in top.  And they close the door, and the steam goes, and the door's open, and he's like a toothpick. 
[02:14:30]  But his head is still the size of his head.  And he walks out all like, brr, brr, brr, brr.  I've seen it.  You know, they could cut a lot of weight cartoons.  Yeah, me too.  It seems like it would be, wasn't it harder to fight the day after you put all that weight on?  Like, it just seems like to get into fighting shape, you'd want to be kind of heavy going in.  Yeah, it just seems like there's a better way to do that.  Yeah.  Because it's got to tire you out a little bit to put your body through that.  Oh, it's exhausting.  Yeah, it's a horrible process.  But what are you going to do?  You sign a contract, and the contract calls for a weight class.  If you say you're going to make weight, you've got to make weight, whether it's tiring or not. 
[02:15:00]  But do guys purposely lose all that weight so they can be heavier on fight day?  Maybe a little bit.  You know, I would prefer to be the lighter guy in the ring.  There's a huge misconception.  Dates back to when we were kids on recess and we get beat up.  It was easier to go tell your dad the kid that beat you up was bigger.  But the truth is you always want to be the smaller guy.  You can move a little better.  You're quicker.  You know, Mike Tyson was 220 pounds.  Muhammad Ali was 198 pounds.  They were never one time did either of those guys have a size advantage. 
[02:15:30]  So there's a big misconception about that.  Ali was under 200 pounds.  That's just unbelievable.  198 when he first won the title.  That's unbelievable.  We've had Tyson here.  He's, you know, I wouldn't call him small, but I thought he would be.  I thought you were going to say a nerd.  Oh, fuck.  You thought you were going to have a size.  Right.  But I thought he would be bigger.  I thought he would be bigger.  Didn't you?  Yeah, and he was, one time he was really high energy.  And when he brought his wife was in the second time and he was very, very mellow.  And, yeah, he just seems like he's just at peace now. 
[02:16:00]  It's really weird.  It's kind of nice to see.  He's just like a comfortable.  And we're going to go see his one-man show soon.  Yeah, next week.  Dana White saw that.  He said it is excellent.  Yeah.  He saw the debut one.  He said it is so funny.  You have to say, I bought tickets.  I bought six tickets.  Me and my coaches were going to go to that.  He was coming to Portland and he canceled and I don't know why.  It just happened about a month ago.  We were so excited.  We were going to see that show.  He's going to Europe.  He's selling out Germany.  He's like David Hasselhoff over there.  When you listen to him talk about his life, he talks about it like you're hanging out with him and your friend. 
[02:16:30]  It doesn't feel like a scripted thing.  He just talks like we're talking right now.  It's really, really great.  And I've seen it once and I'm seeing it again with Hope next week.  Is it next week already?  Yes, it's the 28th.  It's the night after the fight.  Why didn't I think it was in May?  So why don't you stay in New York and go?  I would love to see it.  Yeah.  It's at the Beacon Theater here the next night.  So do you have any, I mean, obviously you always get a little nervous before a fight.  But Jon Jones, I mean, he's just a guy.  But he's technically, I think, what, 16 or 17 and 0 except for that disqualification. 
[02:17:00]  I mean, he's never been beaten in the ring.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, nobody's even been close.  He is very dominant.  He runs through guys.  You know, getting ready for him, it's tough to sit down and watch his videos.  So all you're doing is watching the guy kick the crap out of somebody.  What good is that going to do for you?  Yeah, yeah.  But let's just stipulate to the fact that he's very good and fast forward to Saturday  night.  You know, he's got the same problem, though.  I've never lost a full minute of fighting.  I just fought a guy named Anderson Silva.  I kicked this guy's ass for 30 minutes. 
[02:17:30]  He gets to jump on me for 30 seconds.  And somehow they're coming out and saying that he's a better fighter.  So you can raise that guy's hand all you want.  But don't make any conception about who kicked whose ass.  Right.  So, you know, that's where we're at.  Jon's going to have the same problem.  If he watches my tapes, he's going to see me run over guys.  I watch him.  He runs over guys.  So let's just get it on.  How do you stop the elbows?  Because he's got such long arms that he throws them like a punch, which is a weird thing.  That move?  Yeah.  But it literally looks like a punch.  Yeah.  It's a weird way of throwing elbows. 
[02:18:00]  But it seems like, ugh, who the fuck needs to deal with that?  Yeah, you're right.  You know, I don't know that you do stop him.  I think you just absorb him.  I think you just deal with him.  You know, there's a lot of moves out there.  And, you know, yeah, there's some defenses to him.  But the bottom line is, it's going to hurt.  Yeah.  This is a fist fight.  We call it a fight for a reason.  You said that, and you did a great job as the ultimate fighter coach.  I watched the whole season this year.  I appreciate that.  And you said something about that.  Like, you have to realize when you're walking in the ring, you're going to get hurt.  Like, it's going to hurt, and that's part of what we're doing here.  Or you said something like, just don't. 
[02:18:30]  I don't like that idea.  But it was, you know, hey, look, that's what it is.  Yeah, that is what it is.  I mean, it is a fight.  And you may have to go to the hospital, but you've got to go later.  You've got to deal with the fight.  We get hurt here, but it's emotional pain.  That's right.  That's what we deal with here at SiriusXM satellite radio.  And you dish that out as well, though.  Yes, we do.  We know there's a fight every day.  We get hurt.  We come in here.  We get hurt by the Twitter haters.  We're going to, yes.  We're going to bully people and hurt people.  Sure.  Yes, our egos are bruised by the management here.  That's the beauty of being a fan now, you know.  Say what you want. 
[02:19:00]  Right.  Go after a guy.  Yeah.  You know, but listen to the show.  Right.  In the end, just keep listening.  Say whatever you want.  Just make sure you can understand.  What was your worst injury?  Talking about getting hurt.  You know, I've never had an injury.  I've had a lot of owies.  What was your worst owie?  I pulled a guy on my face.  In wrestling, there's a five-point move that we call like a suplex type technique.  And I grabbed him, and I threw him, and I scored five points, which was very exciting  as a young wrestler.  But I pulled him right on my face, and he crushed my nose.  And it was broken.  I was embarrassed. 
[02:19:30]  I had a date that.  I didn't have very many dates growing up.  I had a date that night.  My coach grabbed me, and he said, was it worth it?  And I said, yeah, it was worth it.  Nice.  I had blood coming out of my nose.  I was only about 16.  Oh, my nose!  Yeah.  Sorry, something suddenly came up.  Yeah, exactly.  It doesn't get that bad, though.  Or it hasn't for me.  I've been lucky.  Did someone just throw a punch at you, too?  I'm reading this.  I didn't know that.  When you were at the Ultimate Fighter, some Brazilian fan tried to punch you?  Yeah.  Uriah Faber fought Scott Jorgensen on the finale of The Ultimate Fighter. 
[02:20:00]  Highest-rated season of all time.  Thanks for bringing that up, by the way.  And, yeah, some guy threw a punch at me.  But, you know, it got a little bit heated.  In fairness, he wasn't completely at fault.  I engaged him.  I think a fan should do whatever they want.  Like I said, he can't touch you, but I can't touch a fan either.  And I didn't.  But usually I won't even engage a fan.  He got a little rough on me, and I roughed him up back.  Generally speaking, you can just keep walking.  They yell at you.  You just keep walking.  I was stopped. 
[02:20:30]  We're kind of doing some photos and visiting with fans.  I couldn't really leave.  So when he started yelling at me, I started yelling at him back.  And ultimately, yeah, it ended with him throwing a punch.  But I really felt bad because they threw him out right before the main event.  I know how much those tickets costed.  Yeah.  So, yeah, at the same time, you can't throw a punch, but I forgave him.  That's what I was saying.  I want to tell security they took him out so fast, I would have said, look, I forgive him.  Let him have a seat back.  How close did he get to landing it?  I don't know.  Everybody told me he threw a punch.  I didn't see it.  You know, I saw the melee, and I saw the security grab him, and everybody goes, wow, he tried to punch it. 
[02:21:00]  Here's what he did.  He tried to show his friends he was trying to punch.  If he wanted to punch you, he knew better than to land a punch on Chael.  So he probably made security look and then threw it, and they grabbed him.  Sure.  It probably was something like that.  You see that sometimes.  But either way, he lost his seat right before the main event, and I felt for him.  So this fight, I mean, he's a nice guy.  Yeah, Chael, he's a really nice guy.  Well, you don't want anyone to get kicked out.  You know, the guy gives up his punch.  He's paying his hard-earned money.  It would be, like, good for him. 
[02:21:30]  I mean, how much could it have hurt him?  Yeah, what was he going to do with it?  Some guy fucking.  Yes.  You're much different now, though, like, at least publicly, than before all these other fights.  It's really, it's definitely a difference in the way you're handling this.  We're coming about it.  You know, I just answered the questions that get asked me.  I'm fighting a dirtbag like Anderson Silva.  I'm going to say, you know, what's going on here?  And if I'm fighting a guy like John, and we spent some time together, and I saw another side of him, what can I do?  I don't manufacture conflict.  I'm not a trash talker.  I'm a truth talker.  He asked me a question, I'll answer it honestly. 
[02:22:00]  Do you still not like Anderson, then?  I guess the dirtbag comment should have tipped you on.  No, I really don't.  And here's the thing.  Good for him.  Anderson Silva, for all the faults, is a man of his word.  If he says he'll show up and fight, he shows up and fights.  And he did everything he could do to get out of that fight.  He tried to get disqualified at the weigh-ins.  He punched me at the weigh-ins with his shoulder.  That wasn't to hurt me.  He wanted the commission to step in and call the fight out.  He did everything he could do to get thrown out.  And they just wanted to disqualify him.  During the fight, he tried to get disqualified.  He threw a blatantly illegal knee. 
[02:22:30]  He doesn't see a disqualification as a lie.  He just tried to get disqualified.  But he still showed up.  He did what he said he would do.  I accept the outcome of the duel, and he won.  Was there a point during that fight, because the first one you dominated, was there one point where you went, oh, shit.  Because it looked like in round one, you were on top of him again.  And was there one moment where you were like, oh, fuck, something just turned here.  Well, I wish I wanted to have fallen down.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, that was really the whole thing.  I got to read the reports about, like, Anderson knocked me down.  I fell down.  Come on, get out of here. 
[02:23:00]  This guy's a dork.  Will you guys fight again?  I would sure like to, but I can't see us crossing paths.  For a while, huh?  You know, it could happen.  I'm going to win the title on Saturday.  He's going to lose his title at the beginning of July to New York's own Chris Weidman.  So, yeah, if he's looking for a title, he can come after mine.  Do you want to stay at light heavyweight?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't want to cut back to 185.  I will.  I will go back to 185 if I needed to, but I don't want to.  I never wanted to be at that weight class. 
[02:23:30]  You always wanted to be this?  I always want to be at 205, but that's where the contract came in at.  But it's weird, because these guys, you always think, like you said, you always think heavier  fighters are much, like Cain Velasquez.  It was like, oh, God, I remember that.  Who would want to fucking fight that guy?  I mean, what is he at, 220?  Yeah, he's a little more.  He's about 240.  I would say.  But he's still under, you know, it comes back to my original point.  He's fighting guys that are 260 and 265 and guys like Brock Lesnar.  But, yeah, Cain's a force, man.  He's not going anywhere anytime soon.  Yeah, Brock's a good example of a guy where you're right. 
[02:24:00]  Like, he was the giant, heavy guy.  And when you saw it, like, he looked unbeatable.  And then once you saw Cain or pound on him, you're like, wow, he's really beatable, like,  by guys in that world.  Yeah, he is.  And he transferred into it.  I mean, Brock's always had a huge level of success for not having any talent.  You know, he was an NCAA champion in wrestling.  Couldn't wrestle a lick, but he was strong as an ox.  He couldn't score on him.  Couldn't get him out of position.  He was just too big and strong.  And, you know, he'd go on and win, won a UFC title. 
[02:24:30]  I think he'll go in the Hall of Fame someday and deserves to be there.  So when you're fighting a guy who you know is bigger than you or who might be stronger,  your goal is to, what, just get on top of him and fucking just wear him out?  It could be.  I don't know.  Do you mean me personally?  I like to be on top of guys, but there's other positions, you know, and you've got to be  able to compete in all of them.  You can't count on any position.  They say 80% of fights go to the ground, but 100% start standing up, and it's true.  So if you've got a guy like Jones who's a striker, but he can also wrestle, too. 
[02:25:00]  It's like, you know, I guess, do you, Tyson says something about everyone has a game plan  until they get hit in the mouth.  Yeah.  And is that kind of the truth for fighters?  Like, your game plan might go out there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is.  Yeah, my skills are my skills, you know, and they developed, you know, starting when  I was nine years old.  The techniques that I was scoring with then are the techniques I scored with through high  school and college and now.  And, yeah, they do change and evolve, or you'll pick some new stuff up here and there, but  it's very hard.  You know, you've got these plans, and he's going to step here, and you're going to, once  you get hit, you just start fighting. 
[02:25:30]  That's it.  Yeah, then you throw everything away.  You put your chin down and start fighting.  You figure out who's tougher than who.  Were you always a tough kid growing up?  Uh, I wasn't like a bully by any means, but I always was involved in tough.  I grew up in the country, so it's just tough.  It's a different way of life.  There's animals that need taken care of.  It means you've got to get up and you're working before school starts.  And I didn't have any friends.  We didn't have, you know, we lived in the middle of nowhere, so, yeah, we didn't do  anything.  I had a wrestling, we converted our garage to a wrestling room. 
[02:26:00]  You've got a great personality considering you didn't hang out around people.  Well, I appreciate that.  No, I'm serious.  You have an eye for talent.  That's probably why people are assholes.  Yeah.  Hang around with too many of them, you get all fucking, like me, miserable, sarcastic,  cynical, frightened.  That's the word you're leaving out, frightened.  I can't imagine taking care of animals.  What animals?  Horses and cows.  Yeah, the farm variety, obviously.  Yeah, yeah, basically.  Of course, dogs and cats, too.  Probably wrestled a horse or two in your day, too. 
[02:26:30]  Felt like I did.  Boy.  A horse is a dumb animal.  Really?  Really?  Yeah, you compare it to a dog or something that's very intense.  A horse is a very dumb animal, and it's as strong as a horse.  Oh, yeah.  So, you know, when it decides to create problems, it's a big problem.  Right.  Isn't that just like fucking life?  Like, the horses are dumb, but they're like, they're in great shape, and they have giant  dicks.  Like, that's just the way life is.  Fucking.  Like, God gives you, you know, a little piece to everybody, you know what I mean?  Did you like coaching more than you thought you would, or did you? 
[02:27:00]  Because you were fucking really good at it.  I appreciate that.  I mean, it was the best experience I've ever had in this sport.  And I've got to be on all sides of this sport, and I love it.  But that was definitely my crowning moment, crowning experience.  But I was surrounded by such good guys.  You know, again, Uriah Hall, who's right here from New York.  Jimmy Quinlan, who's out here.  All of the guys.  I mentioned those guys because they're your local guys.  But, man, it was just awesome.  And even the guys that Coach Jones coached, they were great guys, too. 
[02:27:30]  But they were both your guys in the final, right?  Both of my guys ended up competing in the finals against each other, yeah.  But Dana brought everybody to the UFC.  That's what the whole show is about.  You fight, so one guy gets a contract.  Every one of these guys was so tough.  Dana gave all 16 a contract that's only been done one other time.  Come on.  Yeah.  Amazing.  I think of the two coaches, you were the better coach.  And it's not to shit on Jones, but I watched the things that you guys would yell in the ring.  And Jones was, again, sincere.  But he was saying, giving more like, hey, man, this is your moment. 
[02:28:00]  Do the best you can.  Or this is what you've waited for.  But you seem to be giving more practical advice.  From a technical, yeah.  Yeah, like, you know, work it, make it.  You just kept saying all these little things that, you know, if you're the other fighter, you're like, oh.  Instead of inspirations.  Yeah.  It was like more practical shit.  Yeah.  I appreciate that.  You know, he's a real natural fighter.  Sometimes you'll have that, a natural athlete.  But, boy, being a natural coach is a tough thing.  I've coached kids for 10 or 11 years.  I have the best coaches.  I've always had the best coaches. 
[02:28:30]  Just been lucky that way.  And, yeah, so I just steal from those guys, you know, same as anybody does.  Just remember stuff they did or said and repaired it out back to the guys.  I always wonder when coaches are yelling at you when you're fighting, isn't it embarrassing that everyone hears them telling you what to do?  Because if I'm in the gym and Kenny comes over and goes, put your arms out straight, I'm like, ugh.  Because he's nude when he says it.  How embarrassing.  It is, though.  You know what?  It is.  In a quiet gym, yeah, it is. 
[02:29:00]  You hear and everybody hears you.  And, yeah, it's a little bit different feel.  Yeah, lift the leg.  Lift the leg.  And you're like, all right.  I mean, you don't want to lift the leg.  But the other guy hears it.  Do you guys ever listen to the advice the coach is yelling at the other guy and use that?  Because it seems like it's not a secret.  No.  I find that funny that you think people hearing you would be â€“ that's what you do all day.  I know.  Is people hearing you.  Which means I should be embarrassed.  I'm right.  It's hilarious that that would be the observation you make, though.  That always struck me in the ring is that, God, I would be so embarrassed to hear somebody â€“ 
[02:29:30]  Like, not even getting beaten up, but just hearing people.  Will you go into coaching after your fight days?  I won't.  I coach kids wrestling.  I'll keep coaching the kids.  But, no, I don't want to be a trainer.  You'll probably be a broadcaster.  You do pretty good with that as well.  I like that.  That's fun.  Thanks for saying that.  But I do enjoy that.  We're just complimenting the hell out of you today.  Yeah, you guys are nice today.  I know.  I don't like this.  I wasn't ready for this.  I don't like this.  What's your relationship with Dana now?  You guys have a good relationship?  Yeah, Dana's awesome.  We love him. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, everyone loves him.  We love Dana.  He's very hard to not like.  He's generous to a fault.  He needs to stop.  He's going to give it all away if he's not careful.  And he works harder than anyone I know.  He has something.  A doctor explained this to me.  I can't remember what it's called.  But he has something.  Only 1% of the population of Earth has where he only needs between 1 and 3 hours a night of sleep.  To fully function.  And he doesn't run on coffee like I do or, well, you, for example.  I'm a towel sleeper, yeah. 
[02:30:30]  Or kale and broccoli like you.  I'm a horrible sleeper.  Yeah, he just is up and going.  And so, you know, if you work for him, it's tough.  We all take our cues from the boss.  And when your boss works every single day, all day, it makes for a tough industry.  Well, what is he fucking holding down?  What's he keeping fucking tamped down in his fucking emotional psyche?  That he's got to work constantly.  He can't sleep.  Dana?  Yeah, yeah.  He lays down in bed and starts thinking, I've got to get up and do something.  Holy shit. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  And he had a pretty normal life.  He'd go out and have a good time or something.  And somewhere in his 20s, he said, I quit drinking and I started thinking.  And that's what he said.  Kind of cool, isn't it?  I think a lot of people could relate to that or need to relate to that.  Yes.  But that was it.  He just focuses on business.  Can you sleep good?  Are you good?  I'm horrible.  I can't fall asleep.  And then when I do, I can't stay asleep.  And I'm like, how do athletes, like when you've got to train for five hours or you've got to fight,  like what do you do when you're having a night like I'm having where I'm just laying there wide awake and panic-stricken? 
[02:31:30]  You want to know something?  You want to know what makes me tired is knowing I've got to go fight or knowing I've got to go to practice.  So I will lay in bed.  I have the same problem.  I can't sleep either.  And I'll tell myself, all right, if you're up at 2, it'll be 145.  If you're up at 2, you've got to get up and go run five miles.  Oh, wow.  Shut me out like a light.  And if it doesn't, I've got to get up and run.  But I'm telling you, I've had to run less than five times.  That's five years.  That's some fucking discipline right there.  That's crazy discipline.  Especially if you're still up and you're like, all right, I'll give you five more minutes.  But that's it. 
[02:32:00]  Right.  Me.  Exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  Anyone can make that deal with themselves, but to actually do it, all right, 2 a.m., I've got to run my five miles.  I've made the same deal, but if you're not asleep by 2, you're going to jerk off and then be awake for longer.  That's the deal I make.  I think I purposely stay up.  And you thought that I would be embarrassed at yelling instructions and having people hear me.  But he'll just blurt that out for everybody to hear.  But I don't understand how you, like, I just, because I'm such a poor sleeper, I can't imagine having to fucking get up and do something athletic. 
[02:32:30]  Like, I have a trainer now, I mean, obviously.  And she just, I was dreading seeing her.  I've only been to four sessions.  And dreading Monday.  Are you sure the feeling was likewise?  Wait a minute, her?  Yeah, I have a female trainer.  Because I like to talk to her in between.  I don't want to talk to a guy in between my, uh.  Your coach is a woman?  No, it's not a coach.  Oh, man.  I mean, that's very big of you.  I'm not judging.  I just, you don't hear that a lot.  Well, it's just a trainer at the gym I go to.  It's not a coach.  What are you doing? 
[02:33:00]  The Jane Fonda workout?  Yeah, I am, actually.  I don't know if Jimmy's being a competitive topic.  He picked his trainer because she's, you know.  Gotcha.  She's lovely.  She's really hot.  I put that together.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  But it's just like, you know.  But I mean, he's still getting good workouts.  But he did pick her.  I mean, because we have beasts in our gym.  Yeah.  And he could have easily picked and had a good workout with.  And he's like, no, she looks like me.  What's she talking about?  Yeah, I'm wearing a fucking headband.  I think she can get me to where I want to go.  Let's get physical.  Physical.  Yeah, I have like fucking 80s fluorescent colors on, clapping in between each one. 
[02:33:30]  But we have trainers.  Like, we have one.  She's an old lady out of shape.  We have another guy who has a beer belly.  I'm like, who would take beer belly guy if you're trying to get in shape?  Sure.  I don't understand that.  Yeah.  Most aerobics instructors are overweight.  It's been my experience.  I've only seen a few in my life.  Right.  Yeah, they usually are.  They still work hard.  They still come in and sweat all over the floor.  They just can't keep that weight off, huh?  It's an excuse after they work out to eat more, I guess.  I don't know what it is.  It's like, hey, I worked out.  I could fucking pound that down.  Sure. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  I got a big muscle-headed fucking ex-cop as a trainer guy.  I don't mind.  It's not embarrassing.  See, the problem is, because I'm not training like you.  It's like, I'm just doing like, you know, three, like a little bit of a, what do they  call it, circuit training or whatever, and I stop for a few minutes just to catch my breath  and say, I don't want to talk to a guy.  And what do you talk about fucking days of our lives?  What do you do?  General hospital in between?  Yeah, we kind of.  Tampons?  Yeah, we just kind of bond over the fact that, you know, our biological clocks are ticking.  No, but it's like, I don't want to, I like female energy like that. 
[02:34:30]  Like, I don't want to talk to a, I talk to guys all day, so it's nice to have a woman  to talk to.  You're not really chit-chatting much?  No, we are in between.  Chit-chatting.  Her hot ass motivates you.  Oh my God, dude.  To do a couple extra reps, right?  It really does.  It's hard.  It's hard not to.  He's out of his mind.  It's embarrassing to look bad in front of a woman.  Sure.  I don't care if a guy, like, this guy's in our gym that are really, you know, fucking  jacked in.  It's like, I don't care if I look bad in front of them.  And now his trainer's out of town, so he went and found the second hottest trainer to train  him.  Yeah.  For a couple days.  It makes me want to fucking get in better shape. 
[02:35:00]  Show me rules.  Well, good for you.  If it's motivating, you're good for you.  My abs are kind of hard, though.  It's kind of hard to get the last bit of fucking blubber off the abs, and I got a few  more pounds to go.  Jimmy lost 20, 25 pounds.  Good job.  Almost 30, but it doesn't matter.  That's excellent.  Good for you.  One too many fucking self-hatered.  What's your goal?  Are you getting a couple more off?  No, I don't care about the weight.  I just want to, it's like, honestly, to not stand in the mirror and go, ugh, fucking  pig.  I get that.  I understand that answer.  You get that, too.  Really?  Yeah.  I think it's all humans, but yeah, we do that. 
[02:35:30]  It's the mirror test.  Wow.  I hate when a girl, because a girl will do that a lot about what she weighs.  Like, young lady, it doesn't matter what you weigh.  You're either fat or you're not.  Yeah.  You're either overweight or you're not.  And yeah, it's great if you weigh 170, if you're, you know, you're 6'2 or whatever.  Yeah, I'm not trying to put a cap on women here, but I think you guys understand my point.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, women do the same thing with the mustache, where they bleach the mustache.  It's like, young lady, I don't care what color the hair is.  Yeah.  Get rid of it.  Yes.  The mustache is the mustache.  Yes.  There's these estheticians that have fooled women into bleaching it. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I care if it's wrong.  It's like, now you've got a Martin Mull mustache instead of the Magnum P.I.  Yeah, exactly.  Amongst the strangest things that sell in America is the bleached upper lip.  I love how he says, young lady.  Young lady.  Not young lady.  Let's talk about this.  Women like that, too.  If you're dominating a girl, like, if a girl likes to be spanked, they love to be referred  to as young lady.  Yeah?  Yeah, that's the way, that's the proper discipline.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, that was, uh, young lady is, they like that shit. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  You don't call them, like, little girl or bad girl.  Bad girl is fucking over.  That's 1980.  Yeah.  You know, fucking discipliner called a young lady.  I like that.  Very good.  Spanker.  That's good.  But as far as the mustache hair is concerned, I don't care for it.  And I don't like the pussy hair either, although I got a bit more of a fetish for it recently.  But, uh...  You don't didn't ask.  No, I'm just saying.  Look at his face.  He just tapped into something.  He was just throwing it out there, right?  He tapped into something.  That's what he just said.  He tapped into something.  He didn't ask.  Well, shit.  How do you feel about hairy assholes? 
[02:37:00]  You all right with that?  Nah, that's not my thing.  I just don't like body...  Does your mother listen to this show?  Oh, yeah.  She'll actually text in ideas.  She's like, you forgot the pussy hair story.  I'm like...  Are you getting a little fetishy with that?  No, I just...  There was one girl I liked who had...  Who was very...  She had hairy armpits.  She's a fetish model.  She does.  Tell them.  That's brutal, right?  Hairy arms?  Yeah.  Armpits?  Yeah, that's...  It is.  That's weird.  Absolutely.  That's a rough one.  This one girl, she was a porn girl, and I got so into her.  Just something about her drove me fucking... 
[02:37:30]  I'm crazy, so I kind of began watching her movies, but I don't think I'd want it in my  life.  I don't think I can handle dealing with that all the time, but watching it...  With the hairy armpits?  Yeah.  Are we still on that topic?  Or the hairy...  I got distracted.  There was a lot going on there for a minute.  No, I kind of like when a girl is at that state where they haven't shaved down there  in a while.  It's a little fucking...  It's getting a little...  It's growing in a little.  What, like a 5 o'clock shadow?  Let's you know who you're with.  It's like, ah, that's good.  But, um, you know, the whole completely shaved down thing, it's just been out there too long 
[02:38:00]  at this point.  Wow, this is breaking news.  Switch it up.  This is breaking news with you.  No, I've always liked a little bit of fucking, uh, a little bit of hair down there.  You don't want a full bush.  You want her to look like she just got out of a holding cell for like two weeks.  She couldn't fucking trim and get ready for two weeks.  I have a feeling you're going to have a different interview with ESPN, Joe.  How about the George Michael fucking beard?  I hope I turn off and know that I'm on ESPN.  I don't think they're going to ask you about hairy pussy.  What is the, uh, by the way, is there a myth about, who was it that said it's a myth about 
[02:38:30]  sex before fights that you're not supposed to, and Mickey was said, Rocky, women weak  in legs.  Is there any, does that have anything to do with it, or do you care less about that?  I don't have the foggiest idea.  Yeah, you'd have to ask somebody else.  That's not, but that's not a fucking, like, you know, sex is not a fucking, doesn't kill  a fight for your weak ovens?  I, I would not know, but I, I, I don't.  Let's move on.  I have no idea.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  I'm the wrong guy to ask. 
[02:39:00]  Just seem like, uh, I better say, you know, if you believe that, it'll probably psychologically  fuck you up more than physically.  Yeah, there you go.  With anything.  Just don't fuck, yeah, if you think it's going to take some power away from your legs and  stuff, then it might.  Sugar Ray Leonard was on, he told a story about how that guy could fight.  That is great.  We almost had him crying.  Yeah, he was just so good.  He had a fucking tough life growing up.  Really?  Yeah, what was he?  He didn't start boxing until 14.  Really?  Won an Olympic gold medal just a few years later. 
[02:39:30]  Wow.  Started at 14.  That's incredible.  His mentor kind of did something sexual with him or hit on him.  He wrote about it in his book, and he got very emotional talking about it because  he kind of felt, I think we mentioned the betrayal or something, and he just, it just  kind of hit him.  Like, I think that word got to him.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Maybe that was just kind of a crystal.  Wow.  That's very unfortunate.  Yeah.  That he dealt with that.  But he was talking about something along the lines of sex during the week of fighting,  and he said, Ali asked him about it.  Like, what's the closest you ever fucked? 
[02:40:00]  Like, it was some brutal question Ali asked him.  And he was like, oh, the night before.  And he said Ali was blown away and just told him, like, you're a fucking bad dude.  Like, he really, Ali respected the fact that he could do that.  Really?  Yeah.  He's on the case.  Muhammad Ali fucking did.  Shigurei was great on our show, man.  He was a down-to-earth guy.  I love all fighters.  Fuck yeah.  He was so cool.  They're all nice.  Most of the athletes that come in here are really nice.  We haven't had too many problems.  Very special talent.  Yeah.  I mean, inspiring battles he's had. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Dog tired and then throw 10 more punches.  And what was, when his eye was messed up, who did he fight?  Did he fight Durant again when his eye?  He had a bad, he wasn't supposed to fight because of his.  The detached retina, right?  Yeah, he had a retina injury.  Ouch.  Yeah.  And I think he was supposed to not fight again.  Was it Perry Norris?  Oh, I don't even know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'd have to look it up.  I don't know offhand.  But there's always that one fight too many.  Like, there's always, like, when you look at Ali and how great he was.  And you're like, ah, he fought Holmes.  And I think it was Trevor Burbank.  Yeah.  Like, there's always.  But you don't really see that with you guys.  For some reason, I think UFC guys have a longer shelf life. 
[02:41:00]  Because even though you're getting hit with smaller gloves, you're not taking it for 40 minutes.  Yeah, you're right.  And half of the fight is having, you know, is grappling.  Sure.  Well, if we go down, they stop the fight.  Right.  Not just on a knockdown.  But what I'm saying is, you know, in boxing, they'll knock you down.  They'll bring you back up, dust you off, and make you go back out there.  Yeah.  Do you ever think about.  That's hard.  When a guy's on the ground and one guy will jump on.  There's a famous Henderson.  Yeah.  When he knocked out.  Michael Bisping.  Yeah.  As a fighter, when you see a guy down like that, is it just you're in the fight and you're not thinking? 
[02:41:30]  Or do you ever see him?  Because they showed a guy back off recently, too.  Like, you could see he was ready to.  It was, I think, on the Uriah Faber that night.  On that card.  Okay.  And there was somebody who was ready to pounce on the next guy, and he just didn't because I think he saw that he was out.  Yeah.  Most guys are trained that you go until the referee steps in.  In every sport.  That you, you know, you shoot that final basket and tell the referee, don't go off the horn.  Go off the referee touching you and say, stop. 
[02:42:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Don't assume.  So most guys are trained to do that, or they could have some problems with their coaches.  But at the same time, yes, if a guy is out and you know that, I mean, that's a different scenario.  I've never been in on that, but I wouldn't take a shot at a guy just to take it.  Right.  I always wanted, I don't even think they're being vindictive.  I just think in the heat of battle, it's like you just, I mean, again, I wouldn't know.  I've never had fights as fuck.  It just looks brutal sometimes, man.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it can be.  It can be.  Wow.  That's the bad side of it.  I mean, that sport that does happen, you know, you see these car wrecks and NASCAR and things like that.  Right.  But that's an unintended consequence, but it does happen. 
[02:42:30]  But I've never seen a guy even get really hurt from that because, again, they're all okay.  You never hear about fighters going out for long periods of time.  It's just, you know, I think boxing is so much more dangerous.  It drives me nuts that this is like one state where you can't, you know, it's always about, it's about the unions.  I mean, Dan.  It has nothing to do with that bullshit.  Well, the violence, shut up.  It's ridiculous at this point.  It has nothing to do with that.  UFC, I should say, has proven them, you know, itself.  Yeah, they've proven, like, all these regulations and all these things. 
[02:43:00]  Like, is that what the elbow thing is about, you think, just so they make sure that it's, you know, it's a little bit safe for them?  Yeah.  Well, and the elbow thing was kind of ridiculous.  You'll see these fake videos of martial arts all the time, of karate or something.  You'll see some, you know, 80-year-old guy, and he comes and he breaks the fake brick with his elbow.  So a commission saw that and banned this.  Now, I can do this elbow.  I can do this elbow.  I just can't do what they call 12 to 6, straight up to straight down.  But, yeah, you know, as far as legalizing it in New York, it would be a very hard argument if the politicians told the truth. 
[02:43:30]  If they came out and go, look, you've got a problem in Nevada.  It's with the culinary union.  We take big dollars for them.  Seal that problem up and come back to us.  If they came out that late, boy, that would be hard for us.  But when they lie, it makes it real easy.  When they come out and they talk about violence and they talk about, you know, regulation or these things that just aren't real, well, now you've got to debate.  If you guys told the truth, you'd kind of stop us in our tracks.  You're trying to say the politicians lied?  That's crazy.  Yeah, if they would just be candid and come out and go, yeah, listen, we're just not going to do it and here's why. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, all right.  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah, it would.  That would be the best argument they could do is to just be candid and go, look, seal this problem up.  You've got Nevada.  Enough already, though.  Yeah.  It's very frustrating.  It's embarrassing as a New Yorker.  Because the fight with Chael and John is right over the river.  It's literally 15 minutes from New York in Newark.  Let me promote that again.  It's 159.  And it's obviously on pay-per-view if you're not here.  But it's the Prudential Center, which is a great, fairly new facility. 
[02:44:30]  And truth be told, it's much nicer than the Garden.  So if you're going to go, I mean, that's where you should probably go see it.  And it's 7 o'clock this Saturday.  You can go to Ticketmaster.com if there's tickets available.  Well, there are.  There's less than 700 as of this morning.  So you'd better hurry.  And you can also watch the four preliminary bouts for free when you like the UFC Facebook page.  UFC is genius because they show all these free fights and then go to the...  It's like a tremendous dick tease that makes you want to stick around and watch. 
[02:45:00]  Boxing just doesn't do any of that shit.  Yeah.  No, that's true.  Yeah.  The UFC, they understand it.  Fan-friendly.  Yeah, they are.  They're fan-friendly.  It's an experience.  It's a whole event.  Yeah.  We're being told.  They're told.  They're telling.  E-Rock is telling.  E-Rock, can you say that out loud so he doesn't think that we're actually saying that?  No.  He has to go.  He has another interview.  He has to go.  Is E-Rock telling me to beat it?  Yes, he is.  Is that happening?  All right.  Gentlemen.  What would love if you threw him through a window?  Where does he have to go?  Nice talking with you guys.  Not yet, not yet.  Where does he have to go?  There's a boxing show or something here?  A boxing show? 
[02:45:30]  Okay.  That's interviewing him as well.  Yeah, there is a boxing channel.  Oh, so I go from America's biggest show to one that nobody...  Wonderful.  Well, that's a great...  That's a good...  That's why I love this stuff.  That's a strange...  PR department.  That's nice.  I loved you for the first second he sat in here last time.  Jesus.  Chael, look at this.  So what do we do for five minutes?  Is it honest?  You are so honest, man.  And we have to pick Chael over John, because John didn't show up today.  Well, I want to see Chael.  Sorry.  I really do want to see Chael win.  And I'm not saying that just because you're here.  It's like, I like John. 
[02:46:00]  We've had him on.  He's a really nice guy.  But, I mean, you know, you're the, I guess, considered the underdog, at least, because  he's bigger and he's the champion.  But I just, I like you more.  Like, John, nice dude, but I don't think he likes me very much for some reason.  Is that right?  I don't know why.  Well, you're a very likable guy.  That surprises me, aren't you?  And that really is how shallow and empty I am as a man, that whoever's nicer to me,  I just look forward to.  John doesn't like mornings very well.  Maybe you just had him on in the morning.  He's still a little groggy.  Well, he was supposed to be with you today, but I don't know. 
[02:46:30]  He's coming in at noon, but I'm wondering if he doesn't...  The schedule changed or something.  Yeah, I'm like, I'm hoping he doesn't want to not do the show.  He's had him on, like, five times.  But I think it's better that you guys are separated now, anyway, before the big fight.  Yeah, it's a little bit weird.  You know, when you're sitting down with a guy, I think it's a little bit weird.  I've never liked doing that.  And then in this case, we ended up hitting it off.  Well, what good is that?  I don't think you've had a fight like this where you just hit it off with a guy before  the fight.  Yeah, and you know what, though?  With the set of The Ultimate Fighter, you're going to be around him constantly, every single  day.  So what are you going to do?  We're in a society.  You've got to be civil. 
[02:47:00]  You can't just walk around with a chip on your shoulder all the time.  And that's really what happened.  But it is a little bit weird.  I'm glad that you said that.  I've had to do that.  I was on ESPN with him.  And they do it yesterday.  So they sent this 120-pound girl in between the two of us.  You know, fortunately, there's not an issue there.  But if there was, she's serving as the buffer.  Come on.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, because look at Tito and Liddell didn't like each other through that whole thing.  I mean, that didn't certainly make their relationship terrific.  So it's not guaranteed you're going to like each other.  But I thought when I first heard that, I'm like, and this was just my opinion, that you 
[02:47:30]  really freak guys out because you go after them in ways that they're not used to going  after.  And you're better at it than anybody when you want to be.  And I think that there's certain guys that have a hard time handling that.  It's almost like really, really handsome guys that don't like being made fun of, like in  school.  So I'm like, you know, I bet you that that freaks Jon Jones out a lot more.  A little bit.  You know, guys don't like being called out.  And most guys, they won't call anyone out.  And you've got to understand, we're in America.  You're not going to get anything in this country you don't ask for. 
[02:48:00]  Help Dana White with his job.  He's a busy guy.  Tell him who you want to fight.  Don't make him figure it out.  Tell him.  And, you know, I'll stick my finger in a guy's chest.  I don't promote fights.  I pick fights.  Yeah.  And I'm glad I do.  Sometimes people act like I should give apologies.  I'm in the fight business.  I'm a fighter.  I pick fights.  And then I go get in them.  What do you want me to do about that?  A train fighter.  Oh, wait.  Yeah, I'll do that one.  Hold on.  Here we go.  A governor.  A fighter.  I'll show you things that'll blow your mind. 
[02:48:30]  That's beautiful.  That's good work by you.  Jesse.  I'll tweet that.  What are you on Twitter?  Son, I always mess it up.  It's S-O-N-N-E-C-H.  It's, you know, Son.  I think there's another N in there, too.  There is.  All right.  So it's S-O-N-E-N.  It's not his fault, though.  There's a lot of Ns.  S-O-N-N-E-N-C-H.  Yeah.  All right, I'll tweet that picture.  Yeah, it's Son and C-H.  Good luck Saturday.  I appreciate that.  Should we ask you?  I don't know.  I haven't.  You're one of my favorite guys.  I've never.  Normally what we do, we have fighters come in, is I ask them to show up to do a, not a full move. 
[02:49:00]  John Jones has done a couple.  John Jones and Fedor, they've all done something where they just, they show me a move.  I don't fucking fight back, but I want to see what certain things feel like.  He's had a quick choke.  Can't choke.  He's had an arm bar, right?  Yeah, everything.  Brock did heel hooks on me, which really fucking hurt.  But I tap quick.  Yeah, I tap very fast.  I'm not fucking brave.  But in fight week, it always scares me to the fighter, because you guys are in fucking a different mode than you are like a week after the fight. 
[02:49:30]  But what move would you do on me that you think might hurt a little bit, but I would live through?  Oh, all right.  I'll show you one real fast.  Oh, by the way, I just got a text message.  When I first told you that tickets were on sale, we had 700.  Since I made that announcement, we've got just under 600.  They're moving fast.  Apparently people are listening to your show, but they asked me to mention that on the air.  You know, here's a very practical move.  It's not a great one, but this is very practical.  He's grabbing my right arm.  Somebody's going to grab you like this.  They might grab your shirt or something. 
[02:50:00]  I had my hand on his chest.  But this is a very realistic where they might grab your shirt.  I just want to grab over by the pinky is all I'm going to do.  Oh, yeah, he's just twisting my arm backwards.  I'm sorry about that.  No, that's okay.  Fair enough.  And another one is the push.  This will start a fight a lot, too.  If I push Shale's chest, yeah.  I'm just going to hold him to my chest, block out his elbow.  Oh, Jesus.  Those are very realistic moves.  Get the guy in a choke and stuff.  That's more of like sport-type fighting.  That's something you may encounter in the street.  The guy comes out and shoves you.  You snap his arm and go about your day.  Wow.  Now, the chokes are really... 
[02:50:30]  What would you say is your best choke?  Like, what's the most effective...  Well, the rear naked choke, and I have no idea why they call it that.  It's the sleeper hold.  It's always been called the sleeper hold.  The cops used to use it.  The military used it.  Some goofballs now rename this the rear naked choke.  But essentially, you get behind the guy, and you strangle him.  It's simple enough.  It's simple enough.  Why are you asking, Jimmy?  Because I was just saying, that was one I've had that's really unpleasant.  I didn't like the...  Randy Couture did the fucking fingers on the throat, which really fucking hurt a lot.  Randy's a dangerous dude. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, he really is.  And he's a guy like you.  He just can't be backed off.  He's just not afraid.  But I would like to maybe take a choke or a punch, whichever you would like to give me,  but in the arm, whatever you would.  Well, I would much rather choke you.  I don't want to...  All right.  Okay, thank you.  Give him a little choke.  Okay, and I'm going to tap very fast.  This would be the sleeper hold that we referred to.  It would be tight, and then all I have to do...  Okay, hold on.  Don't be sorry.  It's okay.  I have to see how long I can take it for.  Just a couple seconds.  All right.  I can't see him, so...  All right.  He goes...  Sound effects and all. 
[02:51:30]  That was pretty good.  Yeah, but that's not on purpose.  That's fucking...  No.  Yeah.  Fuck.  What do we do now?  I feel like he has been trying to kick me out for about five minutes.  No, no.  Is this where I go?  That's your guys.  You've got to go to that...  What happens is your guys say to our guys...  Boxing.  You've got to go to the boxing channel.  And our guys tells us.  We never kick you out.  No, no, chill.  Never.  They always tell us because we notoriously will go over on interviews, and then the publicists  get mad.  They're like, they go to the press and you're hogging them all.  Because the boxing channel's going, we have nothing.  Right.  We don't know what to talk about.  That's kind of what's happening.  We're a lot of talking about boxing.  Boxing.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's what it is. 
[02:52:00]  I'm going to get a text from Dana going, why did you leave that show?  Everyone listens to that show.  For the boxing channel.  All right, Chell.  Let's get you out of here.  I've had it.  I've had it with all of you.  Yes.  Saturday with Jon Jones, UFC 159.  Very cool.  We'll see you next time, Chell.  Thank you.  All right.  And we're going to take a break, too.  Stay there.  You'll be there at this show. 
[02:52:30]  I want to thank Chell Sonnen for stopping by.  That was great.  It's going to be a big fight Saturday.  He's a really nice guy.  You know what I mean? 
[02:53:00]  When you see him interviewed, you're like, oh, that guy's going to be a fucking prick.  And then you talk to him, and he's a fucking really nice dude.  Yeah, he was great.  I think he's nicer than Jon.  Absolutely.  I have the impression that Jon's the great guy.  You're going to have to deal with Jon Jones now.  You're going to have to deal with that.  They're both really nice guys.  I don't think he likes me.  Jon?  Yeah.  Why?  I don't know.  Just get that feeling.  Oh, stop it.  Why would he not like you?  I don't know.  I have great instincts for that stuff, though.  Really good instincts for it. 
[02:53:30]  But does he know you enough to not like you?  He's been here enough times.  I don't think if you said Jim Norton, he'd probably go, ah.  But if you showed him my face.  I didn't get the impression he liked any of us.  Yeah, I didn't get a like or dislike thing.  Just kind of.  All right.  I'm doing your show.  I know you guys do a pretty good job there.  I do a pretty good job myself.  Let's hang out for a little while.  Exactly.  Mike's go off.  I go my way.  You go yours.  It's one of those.  That's all.  We have those.  It's what it is.  Holy shit.  I'm so glad I got out a fucking apple right at the open. 
[02:54:00]  What happened?  Well, now it's up $4.19.  Oh.  But it was down $10.  I got out when it was down $10.  So what did you make on that?  I don't know.  I haven't checked.  I just punched out of it real quick.  A couple Gs?  Probably just a couple Gs.  Not a lot.  You could buy another dinosaur with that.  But I, oh yeah, yeah.  Another dinosaur for my backyard.  Here it is a dinosaur marching.  Marching.  Here it is a dinosaur. 
[02:54:30]  How did it get so fat?  Here it is a dinosaur marching.  Marching.  Marching.  Wake up little piggy boy and fucking take us out.  All right.  Snoop Dogg's mic is officially ridiculous.  Yeah.  What's he doing?  That's not Snoop Dogg.  Huh?  It's Snoop Lion.  I'm sorry, Sam.  You're right.  Because I'm alive.  Why is he on fucking Kelly?  Is he going to be here today?  Tomorrow.  I want to get lost in the crowd. 
[02:55:00]  In here tonight.  I need to say my thoughts to the music.  Loud, loud, loud.  Who's that chick in the back?  Sing it with us.  No, girl, girl.  What is this?  I don't know.  It's horrible.  He's singing with like church choir girls.  He's losing a lot of credit by being on Regis and Kelly with that mic guy.  What's the name of the show now?  Kelly and Mike?  Mike and Kelly?  This is Snoop Lion. 
[02:55:30]  I know it's Snoop Lion.  What does Snoop Lion do?  But his mic still says Snoop Dogg.  He hasn't gotten a new mic yet.  Oh.  He's terrible.  Oh, that chick all the way to the left is hot in the back.  And that's a crime.  Money makes a man and that's a crime.  What is he doing?  He's trying to sing a little here.  He's horrible.  Is it?  Yeah.  She's very good.  Yeah, but Snoop isn't. 
[02:56:00]  What's he trying to do?  They just cut him off.  Reincarnated.  No, it wasn't.  That's great.  No, it wasn't.  No, it wasn't.  Hey, Snoop Lion.  New CD.  Snoop Lion.  She has to say Snoop Lion.  Snoop Lion.  Snoop lost his fucking cred years ago.  Yeah, I used Sprint. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Used him.  Oh, why don't she eat some of them Jell-O pudding pops?  Pocket like it's hot.  Yeah.  Pocket like it's hot.  I sure do like them hot pockets.  Them's good hot pockets.  We had him all once, didn't we?  On the phone.  Yeah, he was nice.  He was cool.  Yeah.  And I did Amy's show with him, but she had that fucking show on...  Remember she had that show with the singer on Spike?  No, it was on Fuse.  I'm sorry, Fuse.  With the guy from Blink-182.  Oh, I forgot about that.  And Mark Hoppus. 
[02:57:00]  I did that panel, but Snoop was the musical guest.  Soak up your shit with a ShamWow.  I digs the ShamWow.  He'll fucking pimp himself out for anything.  He's a legend, though.  He can do whatever he wants.  He is.  He's ragged hot.  He's only 41.  Is that possible?  Yeah.  He was young when he started.  Yeah.  But yeah, I mean, there's not...  He's Snoop Dogg.  He can do whatever he wants. 
[02:57:30]  He sure can.  Just the most fucking ridiculous...  He's riding around a bicycle with a microwave on the back singing Pocket Like It's Hot for  Hot Pockets.  For Hot Pockets.  And people are still like, yo, Snoop Dogg, it's my shit.  Snoop's cool because he's so sweet.  Pocket Like It's Hot Pockets.  And you're much, you get a attitude.  Pocket Like It's Hot.  Pocket Like It's Hot.  Pocket Like It's Hot.  I've got the pockets in my arms setting off smoke alarms and I eat them smoking hot because  I got it going on.  What?  I'm a hot dude with some hot drinks.  Getting fired up.  Letting off steam.  Everybody showing love. 
[02:58:00]  Herbie's in the tub.  Checking applications for the Hot Pocket fat club.  Pepperoni pizza, much better than some fishes.  Interior too hot.  Let's cool it off.  How can you sing about Hot Pockets and have any credibility left?  Murder was a case.  Murder was a case to gang.  Same guy.  Unbelievable.  Get off my pocket.  Alright.  Get off my pocket.  Hot cheese, son.  Yeah.  Someone's telling me he has a country song out?  Really?  Was that possible? 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  Let me see, Adam.  Adam in Colorado.  What, he snooping around?  Yeah.  Yeah, I heard it on the radio the other day.  It's called My Medicine or something like that.  He also did a country song with Willie Nelson.  Oh, wow.  No kidding.  Well, the whole pot angle.  It's called Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die.  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  They're two potheads.  Which one you got, Ira?  That My Medicine.  I think that's what it's called. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Alright.  Oh, gangster.  Whitey Ford.  Yeah, Everlast, bitch.  Grand Ole Opry.  Here we come.  Oh.  Jack B.  Neville.  Jack B.  Quinn.  Jack took his phone on the candlestick.  Throat stick pimpin' on the one trick pony.  Yeah, she kind of skinny, but she gets my money. 
[02:59:30]  Get my money.  Buy my medicine.  Buy my medicine.  Buy my medicine.  He's got a cowboy hat on.  Buy my medicine.  Buy my medicine.  Buy my medicine.  Yeah.  You know I got the head of medicine.  He's cracking that weed.  You know, Snoop don't care what he's doing.  You're right.  Fuck.  I want to do a country song.  Jack's door's hanging around with the fiends.  Guy strung out, spoke to Cal for beans.  Country song is hot, though.  Yeah.  He's got your money.  But you gotta hit the streets, go and get my money. 
[03:00:00]  He's still pimpin'.  Buy my medicine.  Buy my medicine.  Still pimpin', smoking weed.  Is this medicine it is?  It's marijuana?  Oh, yeah.  A marijuana cigarette he wants?  Oh, yeah.  Big fat one.  Roll a fatty for the poop daddy.  Can you feel me?  Girl, my love's gonna last just as long as my high.  Oh, shit.  Once he's not high anymore, his love's gone.  You can trust every word I'm gonna say will be a lie. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, man.  I'm gonna lie sometimes.  What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes, baby?  Oh, yeah.  Now dig this.  Jack starts to track up and down the hill.  About to walk in figure eight's what he told me, chill.  Come rain, come shine, come snow of a sudden.  Get the fuck out, girl, and get my money.  Get my money.  Buy my medicine.  Buy my medicine.  Buy my medicine.  Yeah.  Get my money.  Buy my medicine.  Buy my medicine.  It's not awful.  This is good. 
[03:01:00]  It's catchy.  Yeah.  It's catchy.  You can do it all.  Where's Willie, though?  Here's Willie.  Girl, my love's gonna last just as long as my heart.  Oh, so high right now.  How about you?  Yeah, it does sound a little like Everlast.  Wait for it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think Snoop really penned this one.  I don't think he did the musical arrangement.  I love you, though.  I wanted to hate it.  Contrae, motherfucker. 
[03:01:30]  That's very enjoyable.  Yeah, I wanted to hate it.  It's cool.  Don't front at Snoop.  Oh, boy.  Who's fronting?  And Willie Nelson's probably the only guy that smokes more pot than Snoop does.  Yes.  He did our show once.  Willie?  Yeah, he was great.  Yeah, back in the day.  I think he just turned 80.  Wow.  God.  80 years young.  Pure Snoop.  Buy my medicine.  Buy my medicine.  Buy my medicine.  All you gotta do is take a little puff.  Yada-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  You blow it right into their faces and they fall asleep. 
[03:02:00]  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  How did it turn there?  They ain't used to it.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  You tell them it's powder for their bottoms.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah.  Open up your mouth and take your medicine.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Pull off your diapers and give you your medicine.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. 
[03:02:30]  There he is.  He's doing every show except ours.  He is all over.  All TV.  News guy.  A.J. Clemente.  Now he's on Regis and Mike, or Mike and Regis.  What's he saying?  Or Kelly and...  What's the name of the show?  Kelly and Mike.  Kelly and Mike.  It's still called Regis and...  Kathy Lee.  Regis.  Regis and Kathy Lee.  Whatever.  Regis was holding them up for more money.  Oops.  How did that work out for you?  They were like, toodles. 
[03:03:00]  He didn't want to retire.  He's probably still fucking calling.  Yeah.  All right.  And my office still stands.  It's like, Regis, we...  They moved on.  We got ready a while ago.  And they're doing just fine.  Yeah.  How many times a day do you think Regis watches this and drops N-bombs in his house?  All right.  I'm not going to come down another penny.  I'm holding you guys to the wall.  Not another penny.  You got my number.  You got a phone.  Use it.  I won't be held hostage by you people.  We already hired Strayhand Regis. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  He's already got the job.  He's doing great.  He just thinks it's a guest host.  What?  Sitting in.  Yeah.  No, he's full-time.  No, it's just a guest host.  The colored guy?  He can't stand in for Regis.  He's not standing in.  He's hired.  He's contracted.  Oh, my God.  Gelman.  Oops.  My good friend Gelman wouldn't stand for this.  He probably quit in protest.  Gelman forgot about Regis.  What?  Yeah.  The day Mike walked in the door, fucking Gelman forgot about Regis.  Exactly.  He threw Regis right under the fucking bus. 
[03:04:00]  Strayhand is just shouting out Gelman just to make it hurt for Regis.  Yeah.  Hey, Gelman.  Yo, Gelman.  We've got to get out of the way for Jim Norton's advice show coming up next here on this channel.  Oh, that's right.  And Jim Norton's going to be in Austin, Texas Saturday night.  It's almost a sold-out show.  Yeah, hopefully it will sell.  Because festival shows always sell late, but they do sell well.  Very cool.  And Friday night I'm doing Marc Maron's live podcast with a few other guys.  Very cool.  Yeah.  It'll be fun, man.  I'm looking forward to getting down in Austin.  Unfortunately, I'll miss the fight, but I'm happy I'm doing something. 
[03:04:30]  I actually love Austin.  All right.  So my show's coming up next.  And then I'm going to watch Alan Holder.  Yes.  Yes.  Opie and Anthony have left the building.  Left the building. </pre>
