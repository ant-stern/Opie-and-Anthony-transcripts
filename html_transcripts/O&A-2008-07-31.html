<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts' usual comedic introduction, quickly descending into crude sexual humor.  The show then tackles a range of topics.  Opie's girlfriend's luggage is stuck in Turks and Caicos, sparking a discussion about travel woes.  The "Montauk Monster," a mysterious creature found on a beach, is debated, with listeners encouraged to submit theories and photos to ONARadio.com.  The hosts deconstruct a Chris Angel illusion, suggesting it was a staged "failure."  They then delve into darkly comedic accounts of a fatal cooking accident involving an elderly woman and a fatal fishing accident where a fisherman is killed by his own fishing weight.  Several listener calls contribute to the morbid humor and offer Montauk Monster theories.  Comedian Bob Kelly is a guest in the studio, and the show promotes an upcoming comedy show, the website, and a texting contest.  The overall tone is irreverent, darkly humorous, and sexually suggestive.

The fishing theme continues, with numerous callers recounting humorous and gruesome fishing mishaps, including shark attacks and fishhook injuries. Opie and Anthony share their own childhood fishing stories.  The conversation pivots to an episode of *Penn & Teller: Bullshit!* about "going green," criticizing Penn Jillette's satirical approach and a therapist, Melissa Pickett, who treats "eco-anxiety" with unorthodox methods.  Audio clips of Pickett and her clients are played. Bob Kelly and Greg Giraldo are in the studio, and upcoming guests, including Penn & Teller, Buzz Aldrin, and Black Sabbath, are mentioned.  Further discussion of Buzz Aldrin, *Gilligan's Island*, and upcoming segments concludes this section.

The show moves on to a discussion about high school cheerleading hazing, with callers sharing their own hazing experiences.  A news story about a 67-year-old man attempting to take upskirt photos at Costco is met with jokes about his technological ineptitude.  A segment of listener "F.U." messages follows, filled with profanity.  The hosts then discuss a John McCain political ad and the presidential campaign, transitioning to alternative energy sources. A discussion about a possibly transgender person on Paltalk is peppered with transphobic language.  The segment concludes with more political commentary and an extended interview with Patrick Carlin, George Carlin's brother, who shares anecdotes about his brother's life, death, and the scattering of his ashes.  Jim Norton's appearance on the Gong Show is also mentioned. Greg Giraldo and Robert Kelly are again mentioned as guests.  The hosts discuss their move to Sirius XM.

A phone interview with Patrick Carlin focuses on his memories of George Carlin, including stories about his phone calls, his NFL jacket, and his approach to life and comedy.  Patrick details the scattering of George's ashes and their childhood swimming experiences in the polluted Hudson River.  He discusses George's views on religion and death.  A segment from George Carlin's "It's Bad for You" is referenced.  The show includes a farewell to Eric Logan, an XM employee leaving for a position with Oprah Winfrey, with humorous recollections of their time together and discussions about XM radio dynamics, including a controversial incident ("the homeless Charlie thing"). Giraldo and Robert Kelly are present.  Discussion of the upcoming Black Sabbath signing and banter about other radio personalities concludes this segment.


A highly contentious and vulgar send-off for a departing staff member, Elo, is followed by a phone call with a listener, Maria, who criticizes Jimmy Norton.  The ensuing exchange is deeply offensive, filled with profanity and personal insults directed at Maria, her husband, and her daughter, who has cerebral palsy.  The hosts engage in a protracted and offensive guessing game about her daughter's condition. Greg Giraldo is present in the studio and participates in the insults.  The show continues with further insults toward Maria, discussions of pornography, and a preview of upcoming guests, including Buzz Aldrin.

Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  All right, we get it. 
[00:00:30]  Hey, man voice.  Ooh, you're hurting me now.  Yeah, you know I am.  Grandpa, could you whip me up some ovaries?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  iTunes Apple Store offers slew of programs and games.  How about the game, take picture of genitals, send to friends.  Now open your cheeks up.  I want to hear the sniffing.  Open your cheeks wide.  Wait, shh, shh. 
[00:01:00]  My teeth hurt.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning, good morning, good morning.  I want to get going right away here, man.  We got a lot to do on the Opie and Anthony shoot.  Thanks for joining us.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Also, two times this morning, we're going to give you another chance to win a key.  That might start that car that we're giving away at the comedy show this Saturday. 
[00:01:30]  Nice.  At the PNC Bank Art Center.  Thanks to what?  What?  AmericanFord.net, a Ford.  What is it, a Ford Mustang TT?  Yeah.  Nice.  We're doing a texting thing.  I'm going to get more people involved with this.  So go to ONARadio.com for the details, right?  Okay.  And the texting thing happens when we go to commercials.  Mm-hmm.  We're being a little sneaky.  Sneaky.  It forces you to listen.  So we're going to do that.  We got a trickery and exciting day for y'all. 
[00:02:00]  For y'all.  We got a lot to do.  There's a monster in Montauk.  Yeah.  What the hell was that thing?  There's cheerleaders being hazed.  Got some great audio of cheerleaders being hazed.  Look at the luggage.  We got miles and miles of luggage at JFK Airport here in New York City.  Somewhere in there is pink luggage.  Really?  That is sitting on that pile at Kennedy Airport.  And supposed to be in Turks and Caicos. 
[00:02:30]  What?  Poor Jill.  They lost up my heart for good?  No.  They had a problem with the computers that run the baggage.  Look at all the baggage piled up.  We're watching the news, obviously.  But, yeah, the computers that they used to track the baggage and where it's going and  everything broke down yesterday.  And when the machine breaks down, we break down.  And they just piled up the baggage and told people, take your flights and we'll send the 
[00:03:00]  baggage out to you or you can sit with your baggage.  So a lot of people opted to put it on the pile and take their flight.  Well, it's still piled up.  So your lovely girlfriend is in Turks and Caicos?  Yeah, she's there.  Without luggage?  Without her tiny little bikinis?  To cover.  Without me.  No, she's there to cover a music festival.  Yeah.  So the camera crew doesn't have their camera equipment.  Yeah.  They pretty much have the clothes that they went in.  And that's it. 
[00:03:30]  No other baggage.  That's a nice trade off.  They're on vacation, basically.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  Without swimsuits.  No.  Without their swimming trunks.  Swim trunks.  Swim trunks.  Oh, that sucks.  Every time they open up a new airport, they have a problem with the luggage thing, right?  Because this is...  The new part?  Yeah, this is the state-of-the-art part of JFK Airport.  State-of-the-art, alright.  Yeah.  And then someone's head's gotta roll for that one.  I mean, you can't get a computer up and running again in a short enough time where 
[00:04:00]  bags aren't piled up in every corner of that terminal.  Can I tell you, I've only had a bags lost once, and Kenny had his lost once in all of  our travels.  Both from Continental.  Both times they came on the next flight.  I've had great luggage experiences.  Oh, but this was a major...  This is such a cluster.  There's just hundreds and hundreds, probably thousands.  Thousands of bags.  And they don't know where they're going.  They don't know where.  And after they get everything running, they gotta scan every single one of them and get  them on planes to go to these destinations. 
[00:04:30]  Then what happens with the people's luggage that are on the plane?  Like, is it...  Isn't that too much luggage?  Or they just gotta fly empty planes just with luggage?  They squeeze a couple bags on every flight.  Is that what they do?  Yeah.  It takes forever.  It'll take forever.  It just looks like a nightmare.  Yeah.  A nightmare.  She does not get her luggage by the time she comes back Saturday.  You give her a credit card number so she can buy some fine things for herself down  there?  She has credit cards.  Yeah, but maybe you make her feel good and go, hey, you know what? 
[00:05:00]  This one's on me.  She works for a living?  She does very well.  Yeah.  I had enough of that when I was with other girls.  Jesus.  I was wondering why you were getting a little defensive.  Like a girl that works.  It's not the...  You finally got a girl that works.  A girl that actually works.  Kind of weird, right?  My God.  Do you have any perishables?  Perishables?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't think there are any perishables. 
[00:05:30]  You should call and demanding her luggage saying there's a glazed ham in her bag.  It's going to rot.  That's why I will always bring a carry-on and you got to put all your important stuff  in your carry-on.  Like what?  A change of clothes.  One change of clothes.  Yeah.  Your phone charger.  Yeah.  Things like that.  Let's see.  Any medication you might want to take.  Your drugs.  Coke. 
[00:06:00]  Knives and guns.  No, you got to bring like the important stuff.  Maybe some entertainment.  I always bring my computer.  Like in my computer little wheelie carry-on bag.  That way you have that with you.  You can't just leave everything up to the airline.  Go ahead.  I trust you.  No.  Take my stuff.  Take it.  I'll see you in the other city.  You have to bring all of your computer.  You can't throw that in a bag. 
[00:06:30]  Some people will put it in their luggage.  They'll break it.  Now you pad it.  Bubble wrap.  You put it in the middle.  That's what I do.  You put it in the middle of your clothes.  Yeah, that's why they invented bubble wrap.  My computer broke one time.  I said it because my luggage, I didn't have much luggage.  I just had my big bag and I wrapped my computer in two socks.  What did you think?  I don't know.  What the hell did you think?  I said this will be safe.  Two socks.  I wrapped it in two socks.  That's good padding.  I even heard it clunk when it got thrown in the conveyor belt. 
[00:07:00]  I'm like, oh, good luck to you.  Hey, the news and the authorities, they don't know what it is, so I'm hoping maybe the listeners  know what it is.  Can we get a picture of this beast on ONARadio.com?  It looked like it was...  Maybe my brother could call in.  He's a marine biologist.  He's finally needed on this radio show.  Not talking about Brother Elmo.  This would be Brother Scott.  It looked like it was perfectly cooked like a turkey.  I don't know what it is.  Well, let's get the news story and then we'll explain.  That's the picture right there that we'll put up on ONARadio.com. 
[00:07:30]  But first, the news story.  Well, this is being dubbed the Montauk Monster, a strange creature that apparently washed ashore  on Montauk Beach on Long Island.  Take a look at this.  Authorities cannot say for sure what it is.  I don't know.  Skeptics say the monster is a publicity stunt.  Other people claim it's a sea turtle without a shell or a skinned pig.  Now, there's also talk that the creature is a byproduct of an experiment gone wrong, courtesy 
[00:08:00]  of the USDA's animal testing facility nearby.  It came from the deep.  Ugh.  It's a strange looking creature.  All right.  Strange looking creature.  All right.  That's how the news is going to handle our demise, by the way.  Yeah.  Imagine this is the first of millions and these things are going to eat us.  So, like monsters?  Real monsters?  And there's nothing we can do.  Yeah.  Think Cloverfield. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Ugh.  Think Cloverfield.  And the news is like, well, that's a weird looking scary creature.  Anyway, today's weather.  And like, this is the tip of the iceberg.  Like, we are going to be destroyed now, but the news can't see it coming.  A couple more of these creatures popping up on our beaches.  Right.  We'll tell you what scientists think they are.  Right.  And then before you know it.  But first, sports.  The Yankees picked up Pudge.  When would it get so out of hand that they wouldn't do sports?  Sports, weather. 
[00:09:00]  It would just be 24 hours on creatures that are eating humans.  Right.  It's just about another thousand of them.  Yeah.  And their voices start changing finally.  Instead of, that's a strange little phenomenon.  Yes.  Look at that thing.  I can't quite figure out what it is.  Okay, let's go to weather.  Right.  Yes.  Look at the weather and just stick to the thousands of man-eating monster stories.  Where they blow off the Seinfeld reruns.  Yeah.  They blow off the game shows.  Everything.  They're not watching Jeopardy anytime soon.  Just start screaming, it's the end of the world. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  Oh my God, help me.  Right.  They decided to just do news 24 hours a day because they're just scared to leave the studio.  Yeah.  Yeah, listen how this story ends.  Or a skinned pig.  Now there's also talk that the creature is a byproduct of an experiment gone wrong.  Courtesy of the USDA's animal testing facility nearby.  It came from the deep.  Yeah.  It's a strange looking creature.  All right.  All right. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  Yeah, it's strange.  How about you give us a little more on this?  About to your car, it just ravages you.  Rips your legs off.  Yeah, right.  Ah, strange looking creature.  Oh, well, well.  In entertainment news.  But Chris Angel did another hacky stunt.  We'll tell you about it after these commercials.  A lot of people saying this is a viral marketing campaign.  Oh, yeah?  A viral marketing hoax.  It did look like a turtle without a shell. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, but marine biologists, they would have this figured out in a second.  Of course.  They're saying authorities, and I'm thinking authorities mean they got some of the marine biologists in the area to come take a look at this.  And if they don't know what this is, then I'm thinking it's got to be some kind of hoax.  You get these hoaxes every once in a while, right?  Yeah.  I don't know.  It does look like a turtle without a shell.  Because it's got that little snapper mouth.  A little snapper like a parrot beak.  A turtle without a mouth.  Without a shell.  Without a shell.  I mean, without a shell. 
[00:11:00]  The freaking face on this thing looks like monster-ish though.  Yeah.  That's how a turtle looks?  Yeah.  It kind of got a little beak.  What are you going with?  A turtle without a shell?  A turtle without...  Because the back legs almost look like a different color.  Which would kind of be...  It looked like where a shell would go.  Like where a shell would protect it for all those years.  Doesn't it look crispy golden brown?  Like, I want to eat it.  He looks uncomfortable.  Huh?  A shell-less turtle is baking in the sun, laying in the sand.  He probably just wants to get in the shell.  Yeah.  Have some ocean water.  Wants his shell. 
[00:11:30]  He's just begging for a glass of water.  Water!  Water!  He doesn't have any webbing that he could swim with.  So I don't think it's a turtle.  And he has a big tail.  Oh yeah, turtles have tails, don't they?  Yeah.  They do have tails.  A little tails.  And a viral marketing campaign would be a way to explain away something they didn't  want people to look into further.  Right.  Plum Island, you know.  We do have this, for the rest of America, we have this Plum Island that kind of sits  off Long Island.  It would be a great place to build a few mansions for the rich and famous.  Yeah. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  But they have like literally one building on this island.  Yeah.  And there's all sorts of experiments.  And if...  Isn't that where they were going to send Hannibal Lecter for his little vacation?  Yeah.  And then...  Plum Island research and animal testing center.  Yeah.  How charming.  How charming.  Yeah.  And if you're like into boating and you get a little too close to Plum Island, they  make sure you don't get any closer.  Yeah.  They guard this island.  It's quite creepy.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  It's animal experiments, like animal diseases, anthrax, hoof and mouth. 
[00:12:30]  I'm starting to think maybe they kind of like were fooling around with a few different  species and came up with this thing.  Yeah.  But how would this thing then get off the island and get to Montauk?  Yeah, it could swim.  Ah, come on.  That's weird.  Who works there?  Dude.  Do they live there?  Do they...  Like, that's a weird little friggin' job to have, man.  A creepy job.  It goes down...  It goes down three to four levels?  Yeah.  So they're doing stuff underground?  Oh, boy. 
[00:13:00]  It's like the Andromeda Strain kind of stuff.  Oh, boy.  I talked to a guy who delivered food there.  He supplies the vending machines.  Oh, great.  He's only allowed to the second level.  Yeah.  And there's a guard with him every step of the way.  What's in the vending machines?  How are they doing?  Well, he just brings candies.  M&M's and anthrax.  Yeah, just horrible things.  Yeah, just horrible things.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Little roaches with chocolate on them.  Just a bunch of ghouls working there.  Yeah.  Oh, look.  Vanilla bird heads.  These are lovely.  Just creepy snacks.  Creepy snacks.  It's good to know that mad scientists love a peanut M&M every once in a while. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  I wanted the coconut yak testicles.  Where are they?  Yeah.  Try the shell-less turtle.  Yes.  Done to a turn.  That looks like a combination of a turtle and a person.  Yeah.  Turtle boy.  Yeah.  It's turtle boy.  Little baking turtle boy.  He needs a little sunblock.  Turtle boy needs a shell.  Turtle.  Well, the picture's up on onaradio.com.  Check it out for yourself and let us know what you think this is.  Ah.  I hope my brother... 
[00:14:00]  Well, he's not up yet.  We'll call him in a little bit.  He'll tell us what this is.  Marine biologist got to sleep in?  What the hell's that all about?  He's got four kids.  He's hanging on for dear life.  All right, so that's something we're trying to get to the bottom of.  Hopi, I want to save the turtle boy thing.  Huh?  I want to rescue it.  It's dead, Jimmy.  I want to bring it home and nurse it.  Nurse it back to health.  It's just washed up on shore.  It's dead.  You know how bad that would smell if you just sat on your couch with it and gave it  a little milk and the milk just dribbled off its dead teeth onto the floor. 
[00:14:30]  What the hell?  What the hell?  You're cradling this stinking, rotting meat.  And you're just dripping milk and it's cascading over its teeth and gums onto the couch.  Because it's dead.  You're like, come on.  Oh, you must be full.  Yeah.  Mother, a turtle boy won't get up.  Yeah, we should steal this thing and give it to someone's grandma.  Turtle boy.  And tell grandma, it really is alive.  It's just sleeping and we need you to nurse it back to health.  And then we'll check back in two weeks.  It's a big cat. 
[00:15:00]  He had his hair scared off.  You have to pet under his chin a lot to help his hair grow back.  Shooka, shooka.  Under the chin.  Shooka.  She's caressing this dead thing.  Bones.  A very good point being made today.  The news.  Well, that's really weird and strange and could kill us and take over the world.  But anyway.  End of civilization as we know it.  We got a schedule that we have to keep here on the local news.  Yeah.  All right.  What else we got going on today?  We got this Chris Angel thing really kind of pissed us off how they're reporting this 
[00:15:30]  on the news.  They're buying into his stunt.  Why do we have to go on the air and point out how the news just kind of sucks, screws  up, doesn't, can't identify a hoax?  Yeah.  Chris Angel is, he does some of that, what's called trickery.  Trickery.  It's all about trickery.  Yeah.  So why are you buying into it?  Everything he does.  It's cool.  Some of the stuff he comes up with is really cool to check out and the fun is trying to  figure out how he did things. 
[00:16:00]  Uh-huh.  But he's not a magic man.  No.  And everything he does is very calculated, tested, and he's fine.  Yeah.  It's what he does.  He makes it look like things go wrong, like he just missed or just escaped something.  Well, they had a little thing.  Should we just play the story or you want to like...  Yeah, yeah.  Go ahead.  Play the story.  We got problems.  And if you could hear where the problems are, then, you know, give yourself an A today. 
[00:16:30]  You're smart.  Yeah.  Well, in Florida, an illusion backfires for a magician, Chris Angel.  He gave himself less than three and a half minutes, look at this, to escape before Dynamite  demolished a Clearwater hotel.  Now, to get out, he had to uncuff, unhandcuff himself from a hotel balcony, go through some  locked doors and make it up to the roof for a waiting helicopter.  He couldn't pick the last lock.  After the explosion, Angel emerged from the hotel rubble.  And he says it's a good thing that he had a backup plan. 
[00:17:00]  But I guess because he's a magician, he's not sharing what it was.  No.  Well, how about we share what it was?  Yeah.  And how about you report that this didn't go wrong?  This is exactly how he wanted this stunt to go.  Went off without a hitch.  Do you think he was supposed to go to the roof and take a heli...  You know how anticlimactic that would be?  It would just be like, who cares?  All right.  He made it to the roof.  There's a helicopter.  It whisks him off.  And someone hits the friggin' button and blows the building up.  And just getting through the paperwork to get a helicopter guy to go, okay... 
[00:17:30]  Above an exploding building.  Yeah, I will rescue you with seconds to spare.  Yeah.  It ain't happening.  So to him, he's like, okay, I can't do the helicopter thing.  Second of all, these picks for these locks...  Yeah.  They're also called keys.  Yeah.  Like he couldn't pick the last lock.  Right.  It's the first time ever he can't get out of a lock.  Like if you're one of these magic men, the one thing you know how to do really well 
[00:18:00]  is pick locks.  Yeah.  That's what you do.  That's what you do all the time.  I'm not a magic man and I can pick a few locks.  Everything is done.  It's pretty easy actually.  Everything he does involves him being cuffed or restrained in some way, shape or form.  And he's constantly having to pick the lock.  Right.  You'd mean to tell me this one time he couldn't do it.  Right.  So he had to come up with another plan.  Yeah.  The plan was that he wasn't going to be able to pick the last lock.  There was going to be no helicopter rescuing him as a building is exploding. 
[00:18:30]  So he was going to be in this exploding building.  And then he walks out of the rubble like he's a WWE wrestler.  Yeah.  He was really working it.  He was a little woozy as he walks out of the rubble, which was just hacky.  Yeah.  Basically, he ran down a few flights of stairs, ran out the back where no one could see him  because these demolition experts, they could drop these buildings on a dime.  We've all seen the specials on TV.  Yeah.  They can knock some of these buildings down in Manhattan without affecting the buildings 
[00:19:00]  around them.  Yep.  They do it all the time.  They do it all the time.  So then he runs to a safe area outside the building, right?  Some kind of improvised bunker, I would think.  Right.  They probably made a little bunker for him.  And then they had some kind of tunnel that was reinforced so now he could go through the  building again.  He wouldn't have been in the tunnel as the building collapsed.  That's taken way too much of a chance.  I'm sure he was in a secured area.  Secured area and then some kind of like a reinforced tunnel that makes it look like  he's crawling from the wreckage. 
[00:19:30]  And he gets out and starts walking through the dust and oh my God, there he is.  He's okay.  A little dazed and confused, but he's okay.  Let's put him in an ambulance just to make sure.  That's exactly how it was supposed to go off.  Right.  He's not reporting that it went wrong.  No.  That's how it was supposed to go.  No.  How did they...  How did they report it as something that went wrong?  Illusionist Criss Angel was going from Plum Island in a little turtle shell and going  through a gamma radiation machine and things went wrong. 
[00:20:00]  That's what I want to see.  He was seen napping on the beach.  Little turtle boy.  I mean...  With his heavy metal hairdo.  He came up with a great trick, but the news...  Come on.  You know, let the dummies be fooled.  Not you.  You're the news.  Do you really think there's a lot of insurance that goes into it when you're going to be  involved with an exploding building in a helicopter?  Of course.  Yeah.  It's not a helicopter operator alive that's going to go, all right, I'll take the chance  for you.  Yeah.  For your TV show.  Let me hover over this exploding building. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  How much do they charge for insurance?  He's going to be where?  Inside the building and it blows up.  Yeah.  But he's not going to come out.  No, no, there's a little tunnel.  The building will collapse on him and he'll come out with dust.  Yeah.  All right.  $86 million, please, for one day insurance.  You have to insure assuming the guy's going to die.  You can't...  Yeah.  Plus, I wonder if you've got to tell them how the trick is done.  Huh?  You probably have to tell the insurance company how the trick is done.  Of course.  Of course.  I would just say it's magic.  Probably.  And then they would go, okay.  Oh, oh, oh, it's magic! 
[00:21:00]  If it's magic, then you can't be hurt.  How about a little pilot today, see?  That's the...  I'm the king of the one-hit wonder.  That's the explanation he gives.  Well, what happens is when the building comes down, they sprinkle fairy dust on me.  I disappear.  Hey, we've got some more info on this.  That's why I love having a national radio show.  Jeff in Clearwater is going to give us more.  Oh.  Jeff?  Yeah.  This happened down near you, right?  Yeah, it just happened down here.  It was a big hype.  It was on the news from this morning all the way until it happened. 
[00:21:30]  Can we get some local news clips from down there?  And what was he saying?  Check Bay9news.com.  That's the local news.  All right.  We'll try to get some clips.  Thanks for the heads up, Jeff.  I appreciate it.  Yeah, he was...  Yeah, just check that out.  You'll see the stuff he said.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, bro.  Yeah, yeah.  Bye.  Never believe it's not so.  It's magic. 
[00:22:00]  It's magic.  That's right.  I agree.  He's magical.  That's stupid.  Every time, right?  Pete in Ohio, what's up?  It's so obnoxious.  Hey.  It shatters the silence.  Oh, by the way, yes, it was some wizardry.  Who's a wizard?  Who's a wizard?  Pete.  Maybe we could get Ted the Wizard to explain what Criss Angel did after the break.  I think Ted keeps the secrets.  Pete, what do you got? 
[00:22:30]  Keep the secrets.  Yeah, I'm on onaradio.com, and I'm looking at the Montauk Monster.  Yeah.  And I'd definitely say it's Mutant.  It looks like the Mutant from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that Shredder created.  Mm.  Well.  I say Mutant.  Hi.  Please tell me you're no older than 14.  I never saw one of those dumb movies.  No.  All right, sir.  Thanks.  The turtle creature boy is sleeping on his stomach, and he looks like he's sleeping. 
[00:23:00]  Like, he's got his two little legs splayed out, and his head is kind of tilted to the left,  and his mouth, like, he's snoring.  The poor boy has apnea.  Yeah.  And his arm is up by his mouth.  He looks like he's just dozing off.  Oh.  He looks like Jimmy.  Looks like he needs some suntan lotion.  A stronger chin than I have, though.  He needs, like, a 45 SPF.  Yeah, he is really a golden, crispy brown.  It must just hurt everywhere.  It's got sunburn everywhere.  And sand is on it.  It's like, where's my shell?  I really need that thing.  His skin is so sensitive without the shell. 
[00:23:30]  Like, he was fine until somebody flicked the light on it, and then he just burned.  All right, we've got to take a break.  So, we've got the Montauk Monster.  We've got Chris Angel doing something terrific that tricked the news.  Wizardry.  Yeah, there was some wizardry.  877-212-ON-A is our phone number.  We're going to be giving away keys today that might start a car.  Lots going on.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Hey, this is Chris Angel.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony, instant feedback coming in. 
[00:24:00]  You've got a guy from Philly, Vanderslice it looks like, right?  I hope that dead thing is Travis' stupid dog, Dexter.  Wow.  Yeah, there's some kind of Montauk Monster.  Go to onaradio.com.  The picture's up there.  A lot of people on the phone saying it's a turtle.  Did they see how big it is?  No, we need to know how big this thing is.  Yeah.  Justin in Ohio, Monster is a turtle.  You've got James on Long Island.  Monster is definitely a turtle.  A lot of people saying it's a turtle.  Hmm.  Also, Marcus from Philly, he writes, 
[00:24:30]  maybe Chris Angel jumped off the roof onto the flying DeLorean  and it whisked him away.  Oh, yes.  Just like Marty McFly did off of Biff's building.  The big Biff Hotel Casino.  Yeah.  And he was going to shoot him with the same gun that he killed his father with.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Wonderful.  Hey, what's up with his cooking death on Long Island?  Oh.  I just saw like a big headline, cooking death.  Well, it seems in Comac, an elderly woman, she's like in her 80s, was cooking and she lit, 
[00:25:00]  she lit her little gown, her little house dress on fire and burnt to death.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Wait.  Yeah.  Wait, I'm sorry and I wasn't paying attention.  Hold on a minute.  Yeah.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  That's...  Hold on, I gotta do an oldie but goodie.  Hold on a minute. 
[00:25:30]  That's...  Hold on, I gotta do an oldie but goodie.  That's...  Hold on a minute.  Had to hurt.  So, what's up with his cooking death?  She was 83 or something?  I think 83.  Was she Italian just trying to make her dumb sauce?  I don't know if it's a dumb sauce or if she was baking because the neighbor said she liked  to bake.  Yeah.  But yeah, she was by the stove, obviously, and her clothing caught fire and she, I guess  panicked, started to run and just was engulfed in flames and fell on the ground and died at 
[00:26:00]  the scene and burnt to death.  He spun in a circle and fell on the kitchen.  God.  Just bumping into things, setting them on fire.  Knocking pots over. 
[00:26:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  What does she wear when she cooks in asbestos hats?  Idiot.  You know, I just gotta say, we're always searching out the greatest laugh ever.  I don't think we'll ever beat that.  That is a good one.  Those two newsmen from that Washington TV station.  Watching the model falling over and over again.  Yeah.  But anyway...  Yeah, she burnt.  This proves there's no God.  These stories come up and then you just gotta go, ah, alright, that solves it.  You don't need any of these religious people or scientists or any of that crap. 
[00:27:00]  You just go, yeah, there's no God.  How could there be?  All she wants to do is like, she's 83 and she just wants to make her dumb sauce.  I just wanna cook.  Lived her life.  I'm on fire.  Right.  What did she do to deserve that?  Yeah.  What the hell did she do to deserve that?  Just her elderly screams of pain.  Yeah.  Oh, what a way to go.  And she panicked and went to throw water on herself.  But it was the spare gas can she keeps by the stove.  She always keeps wanting in case someone comes in with a lawn mower that needs a startin'. 
[00:27:30]  You know, she's old.  Is it true that she was beloved by the neighbors?  The neighbors love this woman.  Apparently she baked.  Yeah.  And brought the neighbors cupcakes and cookies and things.  Yeah.  And she loved her baking, they said.  Yeah.  And how ironic that she wound up baking herself.  Once again, no God.  Because you got this happening and then you still got Nazi guys living their lives somewhere.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  And hiding.  Why can't they be the ones that burn, you know, burn alive?  Well, no, they saved that for the poor old ladies.  Oh, I understand.  Yes.  What happened?  I'm on fire.  You're kidding.  How did it happen?  Neighbors loved her.  They said when it was cold, she'd come over and just set her head on fire.  And people would sit around in the living room and toast marshmallows.  Over her head.  Yeah.  She was known as the old campfire bag.  That's what that Montauk monster is. 
[00:28:30]  It's just her playing naked.  She's cooking in her construction paper suit.  In her crepe paper.  She's panicked.  Like, roll on the floor, idiot.  Yeah.  Stop, drop, and roll, they say.  My favorite old lady death story.  You have a favorite?  Oh, yeah.  It happens, you know, the faithful listeners are going to understand because we bring this  up from time to time.  It happens once, maybe twice a year in your town.  You know, the old lady living by herself with her dumb little dog, and then she learns 
[00:29:00]  the hard way how faithful the dog really is to the owner.  How the dog reverts back to its primal instincts when left without its kibble.  And sometimes, you know, the old lady doesn't even really die.  Like, something happens, maybe a stroke, and she's just stuck in our house, can't move,  and the dog's like, well, where's my food, bitch?  And then does what a dog should do if it's hungry. 
[00:29:30]  And starts eating.  Starts eating.  Comes a nibbling.  One of the best was the woman in the wheelchair, because her legs were paralyzed, so she had  no feeling in her legs, and she must have been dozing, and her dog ate her toes.  Just came up and nibbled at her little toes.  She didn't feel a thing.  Woke up with just a little stump.  And then she realized it was an error to coat her toes with ham glaze before she took a nap. 
[00:30:00]  Unbelievable.  Alright, let's...  You think the dog told his friends what he was going to do?  Like, watch this.  Check this out.  Don't bark.  She'll wake up.  She won't feel a thing.  Now I noticed...  Like, I started with just a couple of licks, and I noticed she didn't feel anything.  Yeah.  So I kinda...  I kinda nibbled a little, but it didn't break the skin.  Today, I'm going for the toes.  Yeah.  Don't do it, she'll wake up.  She's gotta feel that. 
[00:30:30]  No, she doesn't.  Watch.  See?  She didn't budge.  We gotta go to Bruce in Louisiana, because he's gotta keep another theme going on the show.  Go ahead, Bruce.  Yeah, I mean, at least she died doing what she loved.  Yeah, that's one of our...  Screaming and agonizing pain.  Well, that's one of our favorite sayings, when someone dies, and they're like, well,  at least they died doing what they love.  But, you know, people ignore the fact that, let's say it's a scuba diver. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Well, at least he died doing what he loves.  You know, they don't want to acknowledge the fact that he's stuck underwater and drowning.  Yeah.  That was a wonderful feeling.  That's not good.  That's the same feeling as looking at all the pretty fishes.  Yeah.  Your last thought is, I love doing this.  Yeah.  I love this.  That's not what you're thinking at all.  You're like, holy ass, I can't breathe and I'm a hundred feet under the water.  I love cooking and feeling every nerve ending in my body in agonizing pain. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, fire is just hot.  Awful.  It hurts so badly and so deeply.  You think as she was burning, a big vat of vinegar might have fell off the shelf.  Oh, and gone into some of those open.  Like she banged into the lemon juice that she had sitting out.  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  Look, just go with the bit.  Obviously, why would she have a big vat of lemon juice?  Well, she got gasoline next to the stove.  Exactly.  And in his bestest hat.  She wore straw shoulder pads to cook.  She's cooking in straw.  A dress made of straw and a boy's tail hair.  Wonderful.  Let's say hi to Sean in Rockland County.  Sean, what's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to correct Anthony.  A couple minutes ago, he said those Nazis were living and hiding.  I believe they actually have popular morning radio shows. 
[00:32:30]  Oh.  Opie said Nazis are hiding.  Ah, they can't tell our voices apart after 14 years.  Thank you, Sean.  She would always wear her kindling bracelet and little dry leaf rings.  I just love the leaves.  The kids gave her rings made of dry leaves.  It's just a big hazard walking around.  Washed her pants in kerosene.  She just stunk this old lady.  To get the racing stripes out of her underpants. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Brain, Boston, listening on BCN.  Did very well in Boston with the ratings.  I want to acknowledge that.  Yes.  She'd wear a suit.  Hold on, hold on.  Her clothes were made out of the same paper they wrap a cigarette in.  Yes.  And she does slow burn.  And she probably was too stupid to put it out.  She would just look at it burn.  Ah!  And she just stared at it.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I think she had like tissue paper cabinets too. 
[00:33:30]  Let's just completely exaggerate this whole thing.  Yeah.  Everything.  Let's say hi to Brain.  Brain, what do you got?  Hey, I think it's a misprint fellas.  My name's Brian.  Hey, she just printed it Brain.  Alright.  What's up Brian?  Brian!  I heard her sauce was to die for.  To die for.  We got another one too.  Bill, what's up?  Oh Bill.  Hey.  God needed a creme brulee, huh? 
[00:34:00]  Oof.  Yeah, I like Bill.  He's keeping another bit going there.  I hate these local stories, though.  It's right in Comac.  I know.  Probably got, like, the suns listening or something.  Look, we know it's horrible.  You're fans of the show.  That was my grandma.  We know it's horrible.  I'm sorry.  Jason Baltimore, what's up?  Hi, bub-b-b-boys.  Hey.  Hey.  I just wanted to point out to little Jimmy there that while an asbestos hat is hilarious,  it's also a flame retardant.  Oh, way to wreck our bit.  No, no, it's probably better, because maybe that was the only part of it that didn't burn 
[00:34:30]  then.  Maybe the top of her skull was protected, and then a gentleman came in and removed her hat  so that her head caught fire.  And then she caught mesothelioma from the asbestos.  I love how Jimmy just spun that.  I mean, basically, her brain was intact so she could feel every awful sensation.  Oh, true.  Yes, yes.  Because her head didn't burn.  Right.  She had the asbestos hat on.  See, Jim was accurate in the law run.  Because her children worried about it. 
[00:35:00]  What she would do is she would make pasta, and she was lazy, so instead of walking to  the table, she would take the whole thing and throw it back over her head into a bowl,  and she was constantly scalding her scalp and neck with hot pasta.  So they bought her an asbestos hat with a metal chin strap, and that's how she'd cook.  So she felt everything.  We're just awful people, and our listeners are awful, because they're helping us today.  Every other radio station is reporting this as a very tragic story coming out of Long Island  this morning.  Tragedy in Comac. 
[00:35:30]  All right.  Everyone's saying it's fireproof.  Whatever.  Let's say hi to Jose in Flushing.  Jose, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I was reading about the Montauk monster.  They were saying that it couldn't be a turtle because it had teeth, and they found that  it had hair.  I like turtles.  It had hair?  What do you mean it had hair?  It had fur.  I mean, fur, fur, fur.  Sorry.  Some people are saying that this can't be a turtle because it has teeth.  Does it have teeth?  It was in, I think, Newsier, Daily News on A4, and they tell you more about it.  It came out on some website, and they had a picture of it with the fur or whatever. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, really?  Let's get more info on the Montauk monster.  It's a parrot.  We got the picture up on onaradio.com.  I think it's a bison.  You can't tell how big it is.  There's no scale.  Imagine this is under a microscope, and it's just a bed bug or something.  What kind of bug?  Or if they show something really small by the right knee, and it's a house.  Yeah.  That's a large.  A big house. 
[00:36:30]  Heavy machinery.  That's a large animal.  Well, that would be scary.  I like turtles.  Yes, we all do.  Oh, we know.  They should superimpose a sky behind it and put a little cape on it.  It's called a flying pig boy thing.  Why not?  You guys want to take a dog-eating person story from a cop?  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  Smitty, Jersey, what's up?  The cop you did.  Hey, guys.  Great story for you.  We get to call not too long ago about a house that neighbors haven't seen this old man in a while. 
[00:37:00]  So we're trying to get in the house.  The house is all locked up.  So finally, we get through a window.  Get through the windows.  Dog crap all over the house.  Dog meets us, licking us, you know, trying to pet the dog, keep the dog away from you.  We find a guy in a foyer on the front of the house.  Guess what's removed from his body?  Wow.  Roined, testicle area.  This dog's licking us all.  We're trying to be nice to the dog.  And then we find out, oh, my God, he ate his own owner's dog. 
[00:37:30]  You know, testicles in the groin area.  Well, you got to think that's the softest spot to go for if you're a hungry dog.  Oh, man.  You're not going to try to get some meat off the shin.  Well, what did they do when he was alive?  Try to be nice to the dog, and he's licking us all.  And then we see this.  We're like, oh, my God, get this thing away from me.  It shows you what kind of an active life they had together, though.  Because, you know, I guarantee you, the old guy would, you know,  a little peanut butter.  The dog would think, oh, it's going right for it. 
[00:38:00]  I'm really going to get a snack.  Very good, Smitty.  Yeah, these stories pop up, man.  I'm telling you.  I tell you, hey, you guys, police officers got those stories all the time about, you know,  going into the house, the guy dying on the pole, you know, with his face melting away  because he's been sitting in the bathroom for five days at a time, you know?  Oh, wonderful.  That's like out of seven.  No kidding.  All right, boys.  All right, Smitty, thank you.  Yep.  Someone is saying the Montauk monster might be a progeria kid.  It does look a little like that. 
[00:38:30]  Maybe it's a Maury reject.  Just going to the beach, trying to get a little sun.  You know, I don't get out much.  My body is that of a 90-year-old man, and I'm six.  Yeah, there's a God.  Little progeria kid.  Boy, they probably do burn really easily, too.  Just got to sunblock them with spackle.  Poor little bastard.  By the way, the Holy Rollers, you don't have to call a show.  We like to say there's no God just because it makes it a lot more fun.  Just leave us alone, please.  Holy Rollers. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, they call every time we go, obviously, there's no God,  and then they have to call up and explain why this stuff happens.  Because God works in mysterious ways.  Exactly.  Why would God take an old lady  and give her the most painful death known to any life form?  Yeah.  Burning to death.  Not even smoke inhalation.  Yeah.  Burning to death.  Yeah, we would like to break it down.  And she was dead at the scene.  So it's not even like, you know, 
[00:39:30]  all right, her burns were bad,  but she barbecued.  She just rendered.  You know what that means?  That means the fire had to get bored.  Right.  It went out on its own.  It said, you know,  I guess we're done here.  There's nothing left to burn on the old lady.  Yeah.  Oof.  God.  That just really wakes up your nerve endings.  Oh, fire.  A nice burn.  You know what it's like to just burn a little part of you,  and the pain you feel?  Someone turns around with a cigarette and, like, nails your arm, 
[00:40:00]  and you're like,  ow!  That over your entire body for a minute.  20,000 cigarettes while poking you.  Poking you at once.  Did I ever tell you the story of the girl that set her hair on fire  trying to light a cigarette in the fig house up in Geneseo?  Ooh.  We're having one of these huge parties in the basement,  and this girl was just completely just out of it, wasted.  Hammered.  And she's got the lighter,  and she's got the cigarette in her mouth, 
[00:40:30]  and she's, like, trying to light the cigarette,  but she's too drunk to, like, line it up.  So then she starts leaning her head over,  and she's got the big, poofy, late 80s hair.  And sure enough, she lights the cigarette and her hair at the same time,  and it went whoosh.  And it was probably a few...  It was enough time that she was able to take a drag from the cigarette.  Really?  While her hair...  That would have been a great picture. 
[00:41:00]  Like, right at that moment where she doesn't know...  Because I love that.  You have seen those where people are on fire and don't know it yet,  and there's a picture taken,  and they're just like,  la-da-dee-dee-dee-dum.  Oh!  I'm on fire.  And everyone in the room had the same thought at the same time,  like,  wow, I know we should, like,  put her hair out,  but this is kind of cool to check out.  Because she has no idea.  See where this goes.  Right.  So there was definitely a slight delay,  because you knew you were seeing something that you're not going to see anytime soon.  Hair's a weird thing, 
[00:41:30]  because it doesn't usually burn somebody.  It just really stinks the place up,  and people put it out real quick,  and then just seem stupid and stink the whole night.  Yeah.  I had an episode where I was in the woods,  and me and my friend found this couch foam rubber,  so we pulled a piece of foam rubber out and lit it on fire,  and it would do the vut-vut thing,  where as the foam rubber melts and drips on fire,  it makes this vut-vut-vut sound that's really cool. 
[00:42:00]  It's just the sound that a flaming, molten rubber makes  when it's falling to the ground.  So one of these little pieces of what amounts to napalm  landed on my wrist,  and I screamed,  and this is just bubbling and boiling on my wrist,  and I was like that little Kim Phuc girl in Vietnam  running down the street after the napalm attack.  It hurt so bad, 
[00:42:30]  and it wouldn't stop.  And my friend's just laughing at me.  Like, stop it.  Yeah.  Don't laugh at me.  Hair is so flammable.  Why would nature put it on your head?  It's almost like once it catches fire, you're finished.  It should either A, be flame retardant,  like made of some sort of like a lard,  or you should be able to push a button,  and your hair ejects like goose in Top Gun in place of fire.  Your hair just pops out.  Like if there should be a button on your middle of your forearm, 
[00:43:00]  and you push it, and your hair just shoots off the top of your head.  I'm on fire.  You check the hair.  Yeah.  Our bodies are stupid.  They really are.  877-212-ON-A.  We do have to...  Oh, you know what?  I could use Tom for a little radio tease this morning.  Tom, what do you got?  Long Beach.  Hey, how's it going, boys?  Hey.  Hi.  Yeah, there's a fisherman on the rocks at Jones Beach yesterday.  All right, don't even say anything else.  We got a story for everybody after the break.  Tom, thank you for setting it up.  All right.  Wait till you hear what happened to this fisherman out there on Jones Beach. 
[00:43:30]  Yep.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Really.  We'll get into that next.  One in a million shots.  Sure.  Texters, get ready.  Little heads up.  Texters, get ready.  Opie and Anthony.  By the way, back to the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  You were putting your headphones on, and I wanted to correct myself, because you were fixing  your headphones, and your little ear was folding.  Opie's little ear was folding. 
[00:44:00]  Ow.  I wanted to gently fix it.  But Steve came over.  Once again, I was wrong.  Lard is flammable.  So I completely mixed it up twice.  Yes.  You made asbestos sound like it would catch on fire, and made people maybe think they should  slather themselves in lard before they go near fire, so as to keep the fire off of them.  Who gives a S?  It was still really funny.  But I know.  I should be corrected, though.  I don't know.  This isn't NPR radio.  Just go with it.  Yeah.  But I don't know what the flammable things are.  Yeah.  You're kind of dangerous to be around. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Jesus, Jimmy.  In high school, I was voted most likely to throw the wrong thing on a fire.  We've got Bob Kelly in the studio.  One of the many comedians playing the big comedy show this Saturday.  PNC Bank Art Center.  Homedale, New Jersey.  You've got Norton, Patrice O'Neill, Mike Birbiglia, Greg Giraldo, Bob Kelly, Rich Voss, Otto and  George, Mike DiStefano.  And I'm personally making a couple phone calls today to maybe make the lineup even better.  We're also giving away a car from allamericanford.net. 
[00:45:00]  Details on onaradio.com.  It's going to be a great day Saturday.  I hope a lot of you make it out there.  And there's the ONA Village with Drown the Clown, with Stalker Patty, Pat from Unaki.  There's a sideshow performer who's a dead ringer for our creepy Steve C, a pest booth.  And there's a K-Rock booth.  Oh, they got the K-Rock Girl finalists.  I heard those tricks are hot.  They're really, really hot.  And you can go to Ticketmaster, and it's supposed to be a really nice day, or go to myspace.com  slash virus tour.  I think we're doing a contest with the K-Rock Girls. 
[00:45:30]  Are we?  I am.  Which one is dumb enough to sleep with me?  I think we're going to...  I made a little joke.  I think we're going to have a poke them in the fart box contest.  Wow.  877-212-0NA.  So, we got this fisherman doing a little fishing in Jones Beach.  Yeah.  This is bizarre.  I've done a little fishing. 
[00:46:00]  You know, Anthony, I'm sure, did some fishing.  You're brought up on Long Island.  You throw a few lines in the water, right?  Sure, you go on to the little stone jetties and cast your line and try to reel in the big  one.  And I understand what happened here, but...  But...  Yeah.  Big but.  Dude.  Let's play the story first.  Sick.  Well, a freak fishing...  Also on Long Island, a freak fishing accident leaves a man dead.  And as Rob Hoyle tells us, a piece of the man's own fishing equipment was what caused his 
[00:46:30]  death.  Fishing at the west end of Jones Beach was an afternoon ritual for Jose Gonzalez and  his family.  But last Friday, his brother-in-law Jaime Chicas was killed in a bizarre fishing accident.  The 21-year-old hit with his own fishing weight.  A lead sinker similar to this one pierced his face right near his right eye and lodged in  the back of his brain.  He fell on the rock and he said, hmm.  That's all, man.  Gonzalez isn't sure how it happened, either were doctors, but they know the sinker somehow 
[00:47:00]  became a projectile.  And it came in and it penetrated his orbit, medial wall of the orbit, and it tracked all  the way into his brain, settling somewhere at the back of his brain.  So basically, this was one of those sinkers that is what?  Like a triangle.  It's like a triangle.  It's a pyramid.  A pyramid, right, because it's all sides, whatever.  Pyramid-shaped.  The line ties to what would be the flat bottom of the pyramid.  Yeah.  And it's a sinker, lead sinker.  It keeps your line underwater, right? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So he, it must have gotten...  Got caught.  Yeah, caught on something.  We've all done this.  He pulls and your rod just like, you know, the fishing rod, bends.  But you don't want to lose a good sinker or a good lure or a good hook, what have you.  So you're going to give it the old college try and try to snag it.  So the thing must have dislodged with so much energy stored in the fishing rod that it just  whipped this thing back and then the pyramid, the pointy part of the pyramid hits him right 
[00:48:00]  next to the eye, goes through his eye socket, into his brain, and right through his brain  The back of his head.  To the back of his head.  You know how much force that is?  Was like shot out of a cannon.  That's funny.  But wait.  How big are those things?  How much, how big are they?  They are about, the one they showed was about an inch long from the flat part of the pyramid  to the pointy part of the pyramid. 
[00:48:30]  About an inch long.  Tops.  It was a bullet.  And just came through, yeah, like a giant bullet right through his brain.  Fisherman Rich Voss snapped it back and there was nothing to stop it from hitting the back  of his head.  It rattled around like a gumball in an empty fishbowl.  Unbelievable.  He shook his head and it came out his ear.  Here's the second half of the story.  Out surf casting, Edson Melchiori says it's hard to fathom exactly how the freak accident  happened, but offered up this possible explanation. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, I think the sinker got stuck on the stones there where he was fishing.  He believes Chikas must have then pulled back hard on his fishing rod trying to free the  weight.  He pulled back hard and came right into his face.  That's my opinion.  It must have been a lot of force.  It must be traveling at a very high velocity because it went through and through.  Jose Gonzalez just can't believe Chikas is gone.  He was a nice person, very young, you know, happy.  He liked to play soccer.  Ironically, his brother-in-law was in the same soccer league as the five men that were  struck by lightning on Sunday.  He would have been playing if not for the bizarre accident two days earlier. 
[00:49:30]  Jamie Chikas came to this country from El Salvador a year ago.  His family is now trying to raise money so his body can be brought back to his home country  for burial.  Oh, boy.  Maybe the Montauk monster is this guy.  They couldn't afford to fly the body back.  Said, ah, just throw him on the beach.  Someone will find him.  How many countries did we just listen to?  Well, it would be hard to...  Wait, so if he survived this, he would have been in a soccer game where five guys got hit 
[00:50:00]  by lightning?  Is that what this they're trying to say?  Yeah.  So he was a goner anyway.  God wanted him.  Yes.  God needed a fisherman.  Yes, a fisherman.  I'm hungry.  Fish for me.  I'm God.  You see these sinkers flying back at you at times, but I mean, what are the odds?  Fishing is frightening.  Why?  Big hooks.  They're flying all over the place.  You ever go on a party boat with a bunch of people fishing? 
[00:50:30]  It's the most dangerous goddamn thing.  The lines are getting crossed.  I got one.  He's trying to get under and over these people.  He's going next to you.  They're grabbing the big hook gaff thing.  Everyone's drunk.  Sharp hooks flying by your face.  I hate that.  The best part about those fishing trips, all of a sudden they yell, like, blue's on the  left, so everyone runs to the left side of the boat and it's barely still afloat.  Yeah.  Tipping over.  No one wants to be the guy that just stays on the right side to keep it nice and balanced. 
[00:51:00]  And there's pukey.  I'm usually pukey guy.  Are you pukey guy?  Oh.  Went on a party boat out in California when I was a kid and, God, I was just woofing the  entire time.  Very rough seas.  Trying to fish.  The smell of the bait and everything.  It's just everything about fishing just is conducive to throwing up.  You're drinking.  You're smelling horrid smelling fish. 
[00:51:30]  And you're motion sick.  Fantastic.  Have a sandwich.  It'll make you feel better.  No, it won't.  It's going to make me puke.  I got to lay down.  The last time I went fishing was almost a year ago for Brett's bachelor party, my brother  Brett.  And I promised the video and I still, my brother Quinn still hasn't, you know, gotten it for  me.  I got 12 brothers if you're trying to, you know, keep track at home.  That was a year ago?  It was a year ago.  And basically, my brother Scott took his fishing and he knows where, like, the blues are running 
[00:52:00]  and stuff in some of those little bay areas way out east.  And he saw the seagulls attacking.  He's like, okay, we're going to go in.  And we were catching blues literally every 30 seconds.  You just throw the line in and you got a bite.  Simple as that.  And we're reeling them in as fast as we can and then throwing them back, just having a  little fun.  And all of a sudden, my brother's like, wow, I got a big one.  And all of a sudden, like, he can't reel his thing in.  Does he?  And we noticed.  Well, we all do. 
[00:52:30]  And all of a sudden, we realized that one seagull's not flying anymore and it's just in  the water.  Oh, no.  My brother hooked a seagull because they get a little anxious, too.  And they go for the hooks and the bait and stuff.  Yeah.  And my brother had to reel in a seagull.  And it's fun.  You just have a kite.  Just flying a living kite.  Yeah.  This thing was miserable.  And then, you know, my brother, the marine biologist, he's the brave one in the family.  He decides, well, we got to get the seagull on the boat.  And now this thing is flopping for dear life. 
[00:53:00]  We're all like cowards in the back of the boat as my brother just gets in there, grabs  the seagull and unhooks it.  You ever try to unhook a seagull?  I have, but it was a Jewish man.  Yes.  Mr. Seagull?  Well, it's bad enough trying to, you know, get the hook out of a dumb fish.  But just imagine trying to get it out of a seagull's mouth.  My brother's just working at the damn thing's bleeding and throws it back in the water.  And this one survived.  It flew away.  But we have video, this whole thing.  I don't know why I don't have it yet for the website. 
[00:53:30]  Fishing is just barbaric, too.  At least it was when I fished with my dad.  We used to take this little rickety rowboat out of Lilco on the north shore there, Long  Island.  And again, I would just be throwing up and crying because I was a big crybaby.  And I felt sick.  And I'm just like, I'm going to throw up.  And he's like, shut up.  Just then lay down.  Don't ruin my day.  Me and your brother are fishing.  You could sit there and cry.  I don't feel good. 
[00:54:00]  So I laid down.  And all the bait, they were using bait like crabs for bait.  And the crabs got out of the container and were crawling in my hair.  So I woke up with the crab.  There's crabs in my hair.  I'm crying.  Did your dad ever like hanging out with you with all the crying you did?  No, I was just crying constantly.  Did he catch a fish?  Like I caught a flounder.  Yeah.  And I was like, oh, I got a flounder.  And dad's like, oh, it swallowed the hook.  So you got to cut it out.  No, no.  So he had to cut it out. 
[00:54:30]  Take the knife and like carve open the gill and find the hook.  You can like rip it out.  While it was alive?  Yeah.  It's flapping around.  And they had this little club.  And he just beat the sea robins over the head with them.  Because sea robins are just waste fish.  Yeah.  Big hard-headed things.  And sometimes they take the bait.  And you reel them into the boat.  And he would just smash their heads with clubs.  It was horrid.  God, he was racist when it came to fishing too, huh?  Yes.  A sea robin. 
[00:55:00]  Why can't you let the sea robin live?  Well, because they're very hard to get the hook out of.  Yeah.  So you got to smash their little heads in.  Do you still get seasick?  No, I've been on a lot of cruises and stuff.  And I don't know about maybe a small boat.  And I used to, Sal had like a big frigging 38-foot sea ray that we used to go out on and  stuff.  And I never got sick on that.  I actually get sick.  I never got seasick when I was young.  Now I get seasick.  Really?  Yeah.  If I go out, we do that comedy cellar boat ride every year. 
[00:55:30]  I get seasick on that.  Because you're facing backwards.  Like the audience is kind of facing forward.  And you're standing at the front of the boat facing them.  So you're going backwards on a boat.  You're doing comedy on a boat?  It's actually, yeah.  It's like a three-decker little paddle boat.  One of those steam.  Oh, yeah.  One of those fake steam engines.  Fake river boats?  Yeah, right.  And then you whip around the island.  Why, sir?  I'll tell you, sir.  It's a funny joke, sir.  Yeah, playing poker with a honky-tonk piano in the background.  I caught your act while I was serving hors d'oeuvres. 
[00:56:00]  I went whale watching.  And that has to be the worst.  In a mirror?  Look at both of you.  I've never seen Jimmy.  Jimmy looked like he just got shot.  His eyes went so wide open.  Anthony just came right out.  Jimmy went, like, did you just see a ghost?  Dude, I almost chipped my tooth on the mic leaning in.  Because I figured, you think I didn't catch out of my peripheral? 
[00:56:30]  This stupid Italian face moving towards the mic.  I'm going in.  We both had the same target.  I couldn't get mirror out.  It was the first thing I thought.  Ah, mirror!  I knew I had to structure it.  It wasn't structure.  It was too good.  Oh, yeah.  Both went for that one.  Oh, you had it right in a mirror.  Boom, beautiful.  Wonderful.  Very smooth.  Let's go to Kristen in Union.  Kristen, what's up?  Hey, guys. 
[00:57:00]  I love you, and I love you every morning.  Thank God for my call.  Thank you.  Thanks, Kristen.  My parents got a place in Cape May, and we go there almost every weekend during the summer.  And my husband gets to go fishing with her dog.  It's right off the beach.  And about three years ago, he had a big catch.  I mean, it was bending.  He usually kept stingrays, little things like that.  He actually caught a miniature shark, and he pulled so hard, the face, like the head  part of the shark with the eyes ripped off, yanked him over his face, splatted him in 
[00:57:30]  the face, with the weight, and knocked him unconscious.  Oh, God.  He ripped the shark's face off?  Oh, he knocked him unconscious.  That's what you deserve for sticking a hook in some live animal's mouth and pulling it  in by the head.  Ugh.  Why don't they just, like, there's got to be a better way to fish.  Yeah, it's the same way people have been fishing for thousands and thousands of years.  They even do it more humanely on the islands.  Like, the guys in bare feet, they throw a spear through it, which probably kills it fast. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, you would think.  This has got to be, oh, go ahead, Bobby.  I used to go with the Spanish guys for this restaurant I used to work with.  After work, they'd take all the calamadre, and stick it in a five-gallon bucket, and  throw the bucket into the water, and just drag it back in and catch fish.  Really?  A bucket?  Oh, these little Mexicans were geniuses.  Just a five-gallon pail with calamadre.  And any Italian I have to say the exact accent.  Calamadre.  Amanegar.  Ganocchi. 
[00:58:30]  Ganocchi.  There are just horrible stories on the phone.  Yeah, we'll go.  Like, and this is why I hate fishing, because especially, like, where you got a cast, and  you're near, like, I have this fear of that hook is just going to get you on the back of  the neck.  Yeah.  Or your ear or something.  Or the eye, yeah.  Well, the...  You imagine, like, your friend fishing, and it goes in your eye, and then he just casts  that and rips the top layer of eye skin off.  We got one of those. 
[00:59:00]  Darren.  Darren in Connecticut.  What's up?  Hey, good morning, fellas.  Hey, man.  Hey, when I was a kid, me and my older brother did school and went fishing, and I was just  goofing off.  And I started slapping the water with just a bare hook, and it come right back up through  and just caught my eyelid, just missing my eyeball.  Just don't even know how close it came.  Oh, my God.  I pulled an Anthony and screamed like a little girl.  Yeah.  Just start crying.  Oh, yeah.  I cried, man.  They said that I cried louder when they gave me the tetanus shot than when they was taking 
[00:59:30]  the hook out, but...  I've told this story before.  I was never a good fisherman.  I just wasn't.  My dad and I would go, and I stunk.  Did he wrap you around the hook?  I don't know.  Touche.  Way to hurt someone's feelings.  Are you trying to say he looks like a piece of squid?  Worm.  Worm.  Worm.  I'm saying he looks like a worm.  A worm.  He would...  But no, I would never catch any fish.  And I remember my dad had a Chevy Vega with a hatchback. 
[01:00:00]  Ooh.  Nice ride.  He put a...  Yeah, we were a fancy dude.  He put a big fish sticker on the back, and he's like, that's to let everybody know there's  a fisherman on board.  He didn't say that.  Yes, he did.  I'm like, why'd you get the big fish?  It was like a big...  Like a fish leaping proudly somewhere like they do, like a salmon leaping proudly.  A largemouth bass.  Yeah.  It was a bass, sure.  And that's what he said.  He goes, that's to let everybody know there's a fisherman on board.  Hmm.  Nice.  I like saying things like, a good or a bad day fishing is better than a good day at work. 
[01:00:30]  That's what I like saying.  What if you're a fisherman by trade?  Then what?  Then don't get the bumper sticker.  Yeah.  It doesn't apply.  Let's go to Michigan.  Dale, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, guys.  What's up, Dale?  Are you calling from the future?  Can you get me a sports almanac?  You might want to leave your area.  There seems to be a lot of radiation in the area. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  That is a Geiger counter going in the background.  What are you doing?  Get out of there.  Okay.  Fishing with a girl cousin.  She reared back the cast and the hook went right through my upper lip.  Oh.  The worm was on the hook.  I could taste the worm.  I made a little racket, went up to the cabin, had to walk up to the cabin with the pole  and the line attached to my upper lip.  They cut the line off.  They cut the eye off the hook and they pushed the hook through the other way. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, my God.  And then we went to get the test shot.  No drinking involved?  There's never drinking involved when these things happen, right?  Not today.  No.  Oh, boy.  More radiation.  Now your phone's farting.  Never like it yesterday.  Thanks, guys.  Through his upper lip.  And, yeah, it's got the barb on the end of it, so you've got to wait until you can get  somewhere where there's a tool to cut the eye off, and then you've got to slip it through 
[01:02:00]  like an arrow.  So, like when you're shot with an arrow, you've got to push it through the other way.  We've got a lot of stories.  We could take one more.  You want hooked, jammed into an arm.  Saw a kid with fish hook in his mouth.  I say that.  Guy got hooked, stuck through fingernail and then into nose.  That's a good one.  And a friend got hooked through thumb.  I think we have to go with fish hook in mouth, right?  Yeah, I was trying to catch him.  Michelle, Jersey.  Hi.  Yeah, I had to go.  It was July 4th.  It was in Florida. 
[01:02:30]  I had to go to the hospital because my earache was so bad from all these home remedies.  I couldn't even open my jaw.  So, I'm in the emergency room and there's this kid.  Useless woman.  There's this kid with a hook in his mouth.  And I look.  I'm like, Doc, take him first.  And he goes, no, he'll be all right.  And they just left the kid in the emergency room with a hook in his face.  With a hook in his mouth?  It was disgusting.  Thank you.  That's wonderful. 
[01:03:00]  Needless to say, I'm all better now.  Anyway, have a good day, guys.  You're great.  Bye.  Thank you.  Let's do a double Michelle here.  Another one.  We got a Michelle from Jersey.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  My husband's a fisherman.  He fishes his stripers out on Long Island.  He got a treble hook in his eye.  Oh, one of those little grappling hooks they look like?  Three hooks in one?  Like three hooks in one, right.  His friend, he was casting.  And it came back at him and caught him in the eyeball.  He had to be airlifted off the island.  In the eyeball? 
[01:03:30]  Did he lose his sight?  In the eyeball.  No, no.  Oh, good.  But his iris, you know, the black part in the middle of the eye, goes straight through  the green part of the eye.  Oh, my God.  We're having some phone trouble.  Can you hear that on your end?  Yeah.  It's like going...  Yeah.  Sounds like the phone's hungry.  We're going to have to give up on Michelle's story.  The stomach is growling.  It's like everybody's calling from inside of a closet door.  It's creepy.  It's a good story.  Well, it's break time anyway.  We got Bob Kelly in studio.  RobertKellyLive.com.  Very excited that Bob's part of the comedy show this year at the PNC Bank Arts Center. 
[01:04:00]  This Saturday night.  What time are the doors for?  5 o'clock?  I think...  Yeah.  5.  5.  5.30?  5 o'clock.  5 o'clock.  It's going to be a great time.  It is every summer.  Tickets still available through Ticketmaster.  Ticketmaster.com.  Yep.  And you got a chance to win a car from AllAmericanFord.net.  Yeah.  When are we giving that away?  We don't know, right?  Probably like halftime.  Okay.  What kind of car is it?  It's a Ford Mustang GT.  Jeez.  It's a nice one.  And there's going to be a little fish sticker on it to let you know there's a fisherman 
[01:04:30]  on board.  A fisherman on board.  Oh.  Too bad.  You should have had a douche.  Sticker of a douche.  Or two of them, actually.  You want to do some Obama-McCain stuff next?  Sure.  Obama's saying some dumb things.  McCain is putting on an Obama ad that's getting a little buzz today.  So we got some good stuff.  Stay there.  O.P. and Anthony.  We got a busy show today.  Opie and Anthony.  Bob Kelly in studio.  Greg Giraldo joining the program.  Both these guys playing the comedy show Saturday at the PNC Bank Art Center. 
[01:05:00]  Very excited to have these guys on the bill.  What were you guys laughing at?  Well, Bobby Kelly is on the cover of the front page of Rick Gervais' website.  It's a screen cap from the film.  I don't know what the film is called.  Ghost Town.  Ghost Town.  And Bobby plays a ghost in a construction helmet.  And he's in the background in the shots.  And you're right next to the dude from Ferris Bueller.  Yeah, he was it.  Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  That guy.  And I'm right next to the naked guy. 
[01:05:30]  You can only see the top of his head.  But that guy was fully nude.  And he had stretch marks on his back.  Bobby, you shaved your goatee for this movie?  No, that's Ricky Gervais.  Oh, that's Ricky Gervais.  I wish I was that thin, Greg.  Thank you.  Oh, that is the guy.  It's Cameron from Ferris Bueller.  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  I just like saying the guy.  Swing, better swing.  Swing, yeah.  All right, hey.  Who's the old bag, by the way? 
[01:06:00]  She's an old bag, but she's actually a famous theater.  Mind your P's and Q's.  She's a famous theater actress.  One of the teachers from Harry Potter, too.  I didn't see Harry Potter fag.  I'm a fag because I watch Harry Potter fag.  Are you crazy?  I read too.  They're good films.  They're good films?  They're good films?  Yes.  They're really good.  They're fine films.  And they're much darker than people think.  Really?  Yes.  The first one was kind of kiddy, and then they're getting darker and darker.  Someone fucking stick up for me. 
[01:06:30]  Whoa.  Jeez.  Harry Potter films are good.  Whoa.  Harry Potter films.  Greg Giraldo.  You know, I don't want to make any enemies at this hour.  Steve.  I can't ask Steve.  Yes.  They're wonderful.  That doesn't help my talk.  I love the children.  The wizards and fairies.  I got to answer Boobie Man.  The answer is Kiss.  And the answer to the second question, I don't know still.  Okay?  Okay, yes. 
[01:07:00]  Mystery answers.  Yes.  Hey, we got Penn from Penn & Teller coming in tomorrow.  Yep.  And I got to turn people on to the new season of BS.  Can't say it on this side.  Yes.  Bull blank.  Bull ass.  Right.  He does an episode on NASA, and then he does an episode on Going Green.  Going Green.  That's a...  Boy, is that all popular now.  And I hope everyone checks out what they do with this whole...  I saw it.  Going Green.  You've seen it already?  Yeah.  It's not out yet, I don't think.  There it is. 
[01:07:30]  There it is.  It came out yesterday, I think, or the day before.  I watched some of it, too, because we did Going Green on that Root of Old Evil, that  Lewis Black show.  Right.  And I watched them do it, and they did it much better.  Did they?  They have language freedom, too, you guys don't have.  I mean, Penn is just...  Yeah.  It's a lot easier to do.  Oh, Penn's a potty mouth on his TV show.  He's curses.  And he knows calling the show Bull Blank really hurts him, but he don't care.  No.  He can't really market the show.  It's a funny show, though.  It's like in the NASA one, he starts off wearing this homemade, horrible spaceman outfit. 
[01:08:00]  It's just funny.  He's very entertaining, and he's just blasting things.  And he's a douche.  Oh, he's an ass.  He just really gets on people.  It's so great, because what he'll do is he'll promote whatever they want him to promote,  but then he'll bash it while he's promoting it, or he'll just attack them, like the video  of them, and they can't do anything about it, because it's already been shot.  Well, this is how he started his green episode.  Listen to this.  Listen closely.  Listen to this. 
[01:08:30]  In Africa, drought continues for the sixth consecutive year.  Record rains in parts of the U.S., Pakistan, and Japan caused some of the worst flooding  in centuries.  New England and Northern Europe have recently experienced the mildest winters without any  one's recollection.  It says right here in Time Magazine, the weather's gone nuts, and we humans are to blame.  Scientists are telling us we're heading into a new ice age? 
[01:09:00]  What?  It's from Time Magazine.  Monday, June 24th, 1974.  I've got to stop picking up 30-year-old magazines in my dentist's office.  That's fantastic.  Isn't that great?  There really are brilliant attacks.  Wow.  There really, he backs them up.  I mean, there's no way to defend that.  If you're the other, you're screaming about global warming, you can't argue with that.  I like when he sends the fake person with a clipboard to sign the petition, and they did 
[01:09:30]  one where everybody at this green festival signed the petition because of this thing that  was in offices and buildings, and they're like, yeah, that's bad.  I heard about that.  It was actually the-  It was like water.  It was water.  Yeah.  It was just all these idiots signed to have water removed from schools and offices.  It was a technical name.  It was some kind of a technical name for water, and he was just saying what a bunch of joiners  they were. 
[01:10:00]  They were all just joiners.  And why is that?  It's such an insult, even though it's not nasty, to be a joiner.  Penn continues talking about 1974.  And that's not a joke.  That's the real article from Time 1974.  I'm Penn, and this is my partner, Taylor.  And yeah, three decades ago, pretty much everybody thought we'd f*** up the earth with careless  and selfish fossil fuel emissions.  We were heading into an ice age.  Today, the same fossil fuel emissions are causing global warming. 
[01:10:30]  Hey, no worries.  You may be a carbon sinner, but now you can buy yourself a clean, green conscience for cash.  It's a new craze based on eco-guilt, and it's bulls***.  There you go.  Eco-guilt.  So in 1974, we were heading into a new ice age, and now, 30 years later, doing the same  stuff, it's global warming.  That's the point he's making.  But they do say that global warming will cause an ice age.  How that happens is quite amazing. 
[01:11:00]  Well, they had a weatherman on, too, that said he's been treated for 40 years, and he  showed a chart of, he says, it's been the same for the last 40 years.  Since I've been doing weather, nothing has changed.  See, their big thing is the Gulf Stream moves, you know, from Florida up the East Coast, and  then kind of over to Europe, and then back down, and as it moves up north, the water gets  colder and denser and sinks to the bottom, and then as it gets south again, it warms up 
[01:11:30]  and comes back to the surface, and it just goes along this track.  You have way too much time on your hands.  And then, they say that if the ice caps start melting, and put colder water into the mix,  the mix, yes, it will slow this process down, and then eventually stop it, and no warm water  will be brought over into Europe, and Europe will then enter an ice age.  Oh, stop.  Why are the water all warm up?  In a matter of, they said, decades, not even like hundreds of years or anything like that. 
[01:12:00]  It could happen in no time at all.  Oh, what bunk.  The water's not going to stay cold.  Just imagine the ice skating you could get done.  What bunk?  Yeah.  There was a guy, Bjorn Lomborg.  I hate him.  I hate his name.  But he's like one of the few guys who kind of takes an anti-global warming thing, and  basically, it is happening.  There's definitely global warming, but if you look at what you're trying to accomplish,  are we supposed to make lives better?  What are all the carbon offset, all that kind of stuff? 
[01:12:30]  What's it really going to accomplish?  And ultimately, it's not doing any good.  Like he says, for example, in Europe, 150,000 people a year die from excess heat.  Like everyone talks about those heat waves.  150,000 die from excess heat.  But actually, 1.5 million a year die from excess cold.  Yeah.  There you go.  So if it warms up a few degrees, it actually is going to save a lot of lives.  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  Jimmy, you saw this episode of BS, right?  I saw most of it.  Yeah.  I didn't watch the whole thing.  It was really, it was so late last night.  I just, I kind of flipped through. 
[01:13:00]  It was very good.  That's how it started.  But the real reason I'm bringing this to everyone's attention is because of Melissa.  I hated her.  We hate this woman, Melissa.  She's a therapist out there, Bobby.  Yeah.  A lot of people in this room, they're seeing therapists.  Yeah.  I'll raise my hand.  You're going to be amazed why she's giving therapy.  We meet Melissa.  Eco-anxiety is our reaction.  Okay.  Eco-anxiety.  She's treating eco-anxiety.  I remember this lady. 
[01:13:30]  This lady is just really retarded.  Yeah, but people are buying into what she's doing.  The people that go to her.  And she had a love circle.  What a swindler.  But she went out, she went out, the end of the thing, the end of the session.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, we're getting there.  Snake oil saleswoman.  That's what she is.  Yeah, comment as we go, Bobby.  Eco.  That's why we brought this to everyone's attention.  She has that short haircut, too, like she pitched for the Yankees in 1978.  Yeah.  Hey, Dave Rigetti, what's wrong with me?  Eco-anxiety. 
[01:14:00]  Eco-anxiety.  Eco-anxiety is our reaction to what happens in our environment, the destruction of our environment.  And how we respond to that.  My name is Melissa Pickett, and I'm a counselor in private practice in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  Yep.  On our website, Melissa calls herself a licensed counselor.  She also says she's a student of evolutionary inquiry, claims she can activate your DNA, balance your noetic energy field, whatever the f*** that is.  And she's an ecumenical minister. 
[01:14:30]  Please get her on the phone and say that we all have eco-anxiety.  We're trying.  Oh, God.  We're trying to get her.  I am seeing between 40 and 60 clients a month where eco-anxiety is definitely a factor.  And how does she diagnose eco-anxiety?  The symptoms of eco-anxiety can range from everything from a stomach ache to headaches to feelings of just being nervous but not really knowing why. 
[01:15:00]  It can register as inattention or inability to focus and concentrate.  That's anxiety.  It's like hanging out with Norton.  That's just like anxiety or nerves or whatever.  It doesn't necessarily mean you're eco-anxious.  No, it actually never means that.  No, you're right.  It never means that.  I'm eco-anxious.  What a great excuse.  You're trying to have sex and all of a sudden nothing will work.  What's the matter?  I have eco-anxiety. 
[01:15:30]  I'm eco-anxious.  Yes.  I can't perform sexually.  I keep thinking about rain clouds.  I'm Ted and I'm eco-anxious.  I'm Ted, the earth lover.  Ted's a douche.  I got to say, I'm with Drew from Orlando.  I wasn't going to bring it up, but now that he is, I'm with you, Drew.  Go ahead.  Your observation. 
[01:16:00]  Fuck some Betty needs another job.  That's all it is.  She sounds like the Mondo Topless chick.  She does.  She sounds a bit Mondo Topless.  When I'm doing the job, please.  Hey, please.  Melissa, what?  Tibbet?  Yeah, she's going to explain her eco-therapy.  People are signing up for this, though.  Of course they are.  Eco-therapy is a type of therapy which involves people getting back in contact  with a natural world as a source of healing. 
[01:16:30]  It really is painful to watch what we are doing to our planet.  There's a sense of hopelessness, helplessness almost.  On a daily basis, I sometimes don't know what I'm going to do.  I mean, I don't know how else to say it other than that, you know, we're killing our mother.  Oh.  I wish someone did that before you were born, you whiny bastard.  God.  No one is this upset. 
[01:17:00]  I am.  Oh, are you?  Are you, Ted?  Yes.  How can you think of making love when riverbeds are drying up?  It's the hottest September on record.  My heart's going better, Pat.  I need medication.  Hey, Ted, did you go green?  Huh?  Did you do that green thing?  Ted only had two lines prepared, old.  It's old two-line Ted, they call him.  My carbon footprint is non-existent. 
[01:17:30]  I eat worm feces and leaves.  Ted.  All right, well, this next piece of audio, Melissa, part of her therapy is she goes into  her gravel driveway, she picks up rocks, claims they're river rocks, and then hands them out  to the circle of people getting their therapy, and they all comment about what the rock means  to them and what it does for them.  That's her, by the way. 
[01:18:00]  Yes.  Her with the grass.  Oh.  Yeah.  I think she's wearing a cancer wig.  That is horrid.  I had a whore massage lady who used to give me rocks.  Really?  Yeah, for certain energy rocks.  She'd take you in and give you a tea, and then you'd get a rock when you leave, or whatever.  What the hell is that?  I don't care.  After she had done the best part of the massage?  You got the tea at the beginning, and then at the end, after she washed you in the shower  thoroughly, then she'd give you your stone.  So you have the great massage.  I made a wall with my stones. 
[01:18:30]  Wait, the massage is over, and all of a sudden you actually still took the stones instead  of saying what?  Yeah, you sit down, you talk to her, and she says-  About what?  Who cares?  So how long have you been a hooker, rock lady?  She does all that so she doesn't feel guilty about what she's doing.  Yep.  It's about his system and helping his equilibrium.  Finish your tea, and here's your yellow rock.  That's right.  I'm going to go wash my hands.  Hands.  All right.  Here's Melissa giving her clients rocks.  Listen to this.  And so I wanted to offer you this gift. 
[01:19:00]  She shoots herself.  This gift.  A rock from my gravel driveway.  Yeah.  Of a stone.  Throw it right at her head.  To keep with you in your pocket.  To remind you that you do come from Earth and that you are connected.  If a person is living in the city and they don't have much interaction with nature, I'll 
[01:19:30]  hand them a river rock and ask them to put it in their pocket as a reminder that nature  is there to support them.  Nature is there to support them with a rock in your pocket.  A river rock, Ann.  River rock?  Yes.  Those are the smoother ones because the water is running away, smoothing them down.  How disappointing is that?  She's like, I have a gift, and you're like, ooh, I love gifts.  It's a present.  It's a rock.  It's a rock.  Expecting a sweater.  Yeah.  A sweater.  Yeah, why not?  That's what's missing in the city is stone and rock. 
[01:20:00]  It's amazing.  Yes.  It could be a leaf.  Yeah, how about a oak tree?  Well, her message says she's out of town until August 4th.  We're going to have to get her on the show.  Oh, where is she?  All right, so then-  Hopefully, she's getting treatment for something that's incurable, but they're just trying to  make her quality of life better.  Rubbing hot rocks on it.  Under her armpit.  The big lump.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, God.  What?  Yeah, you heard me. 
[01:20:30]  So then she goes around the circle, and everyone talks about what the rock means to them.  I feel grateful, because I know that no matter what happens tomorrow, there will always be  a rock, or sunlight, or a breeze.  Come on.  Or the moon.  Got this connection with rocks, and so whenever I'm by a rock, holding it, I feel grounded.  I'm feeling relaxed and kind of calm. 
[01:21:00]  Pretty excited about this rock, as well.  Excited.  Excited about it.  Put it with the rest of them in your head.  I'm grounded.  I don't know if they're rocks.  The police laughed at me.  Somebody stole my river rock, and I reported it.  Yes, Ed.  Yes.  I had a hole in my pocket, and my river rock fell through.  And you need to find your river rock?  Yes, it was smooth, and it gave me comfort.  Sometimes when I would get blue, I'd rub my river rock. 
[01:21:30]  And just think of nature.  That's nice.  Nature's here for me.  That's good.  Makes you feel like you're a part of the planet.  You're one with the planet.  You're carrying a rock with you.  I don't know if Sam got the clip, but then she goes around the room asking the people  what they're doing to maybe relieve some of this anxiety.  And one guy actually said, well, I'm drinking less bottles of water. 
[01:22:00]  And what does that do?  Well, less plastic.  He's not wasting.  So that helps his eco-examity.  Less water bottles.  I reflect.  Sorry.  Go ahead, Ted.  Ted knows not to step on the guests.  Ted has courtesy.  That's creepy, man.  Oh, we do have that.  I never use bottled water.  I simply scoop it up in my hands and carry it for the afternoon.  I drink out of it like a small pony. 
[01:22:30]  Gerardo, are you going to say some?  Well, what does give you eco-anxiety is that these environmentalists basically just hate  people.  Because everything you do has an impact.  The really only environmentally friendly thing you can really do is kill yourself.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah.  Because otherwise you're just consuming, stepping on the planet one way or the other.  We are part of the ecosystem.  Yeah.  So whatever we do is natural. 
[01:23:00]  We just happen to be able to grab stuff from the earth, stuff from the ocean, stuff from  trees, smash it all together, and make things that fly.  We're amazing.  We're amazing.  When you look at an airplane, a jet engine flying through there, it's made of dirt and  trees and things.  We just pluck things off the planet and make flying machines.  Why couldn't the squirrels come up with that?  Exactly.  Stupid squirrels.  So screw them.  And why is it so bad that we figured out how to pump dead dinosaurs out of the earth 
[01:23:30]  and turn it into flying machines and cars and heat and things like that?  Are we consuming the planet?  Okay.  Maybe.  I'm not even sure of that.  But what's so bad about it?  We're here.  We're the top of the food chain for now.  So screw it.  It's not like we're importing things from a comet from things that are not of this planet.  Bringing horrible things in there.  No.  We're just altering the shape and form of the earth.  You're killing your mother, mister. 
[01:24:00]  Lay off a mother, bub.  I have ego anxiety.  I can't perform sexually.  It's like a small, soft baby shrimp.  And it will stay that way until Mother Earth is healed.  Hey, Ted, you do some of that recycling?  I certainly do.  Yeah?  Yes.  After I use toilet paper, I used to dry my body after a while. 
[01:24:30]  Ted's helping.  Yes.  It's a solution.  Then Melissa brings her clients to the labyrinth.  This is what Bobby was talking about.  I just wanted to save this, Bobby.  The labyrinth was so ridiculous.  Stupid idiots.  The labyrinth, because, you know, obviously this is radio, and I encourage you to actually  see this because the visuals are great on this episode of BS, and we'll have Penn in  tomorrow. 
[01:25:00]  It's basically a rock garden that's in the shape of, like, one of those...  Like a spiral?  Like kind of a spiral.  Yeah, like something you get out of these Sunday times.  And they slowly walk the spiral until they get to the center, basically.  So why is that a labyrinth?  That's what Penn is asking.  And why should you go through a labyrinth?  What is that supposed to do for you?  We're going to explain right now.  For your eco-anxiety.  We're going to be taking a walk through the labyrinth.  That's not a labyrinth!  Labyrinths have choices.  They're mazes.  This is a dusty, no-choices, rock-lined path to boredom. 
[01:25:30]  Why?  The purpose of walking the labyrinth is to get clarity on a question that you might  be struggling with.  Oh, brother.  Yeah, exactly.  This psychobabble bitch is cashing in on morons.  Anthony, people actually got...  At the end of it, it was surprising because people got answers.  People had answers.  Did they?  Yeah, they did.  They had answers to their questions that they had.  Bobby with the setup.  Wow.  Did you receive an answer? 
[01:26:00]  I got an answer.  Peter, did you receive an answer?  I did.  So what did the vacant lot tell you?  I try not to use so many water, plastic water bottles.  The labyrinth, actually, when I got to the center, I actually felt and heard a really resounding  that it was about my me and every moment of a way of being.  Wow.  I get to the center and it's all about me. 
[01:26:30]  That's deep.  He's such a dick.  He's such a dick.  I love him.  He's one of my favorite shows, dude.  I love him.  And I love the other guy doesn't say a word.  Yeah.  Three seasons, he hasn't spoken.  Yeah.  Well, he gets a paycheck.  That's been his thing for decades.  That's unbelievable.  Is it really five?  Six?  Oh, whatever.  I received my answers in the labyrinth.  Oh, you did, Ted?  I wanted to help in the environment and they said I had to stop dumping gas into the drinking  water.  You were dumping gas.  Yes, I was.  I was spilling oil on the wildlife. 
[01:27:00]  I thought it kept them warm.  I would buy barrels of oil and just dump it on little bird nests.  They said, Ted, you're not being helpful.  So I lay and I am one with nature.  And one time I woke up and a gecko was eating aphids off my testicles.  What?  A what?  Odd situation.  This is a small lizard.  It's lovely.  The other part.  Aphids are little bugs.  And my testicles infested with them. 
[01:27:30]  Aphids.  Ted.  There you go.  There's a taste, but the green show that BS Bull S did is worth the viewing.  It's on Showtime.  It's a really good show.  And Penn's coming in to promote it a little more.  Yeah, it's one of my favorite shows.  Tomorrow we go.  The Labyrinth.  I got to watch it now and see what kind of crap like Labyrinth this is.  What does she charge?  She's a kook.  I don't know.  She's expensive.  Of course she's expensive.  All these nuts are expensive. 
[01:28:00]  It's like a hundred bucks or something bucks.  Perhaps more than nuts.  What were we going to say, Jimmy?  Who else is on the show tomorrow?  We got Buzz Aldrin.  Oh, that hack.  At, uh...  Jesus.  I think really early.  I shot down two Migs.  Huh?  He shot down two Migs.  Did he?  Yeah, he did.  He shot down two Migs.  Yeah, that's his big accomplishment, Bob.  Well, no.  The other one was kind of obvious, Greg.  I'm sorry.  Did I have to underline it for you? 
[01:28:30]  It's obvious to you believers.  Yeah.  We never went to the moon.  It's true.  That's going to be my questioning tomorrow.  He's going to punch you.  I know.  That's what I'm looking for.  He punches guys that insinuate that they never went to the moon.  He has a big astronaut ring on, too, and he leaves just a picture of the space shuttle  on his cheek.  It's just a big frigging moon rock in your face.  That guy, he popped this...  The guy was up on...  Asking him questions in his face, going,  Why don't you just admit that you never went to the moon? 
[01:29:00]  It never happened.  And Buzz Aldrin just turns around, pops him in the face, and walks away.  Like, what a gruff guy.  Good for him.  I love that.  Where did Buzz Aldrin's life go wrong that he has to, like, hang out with a couple of  shock jocks?  Shock jockery?  What's he plugging?  Huh?  He must be plugging.  I mean, honestly, I'm sure he's got a book.  He's probably got a book.  I went to the moon.  We don't know what he's promoting?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, the book is, I went to the moon and you didn't.  And you didn't.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's only a couple of people that, you know, can't say that to.  So, all right, two books. 
[01:29:30]  One, when he got back, because he became an alcoholic and got in a lot of, when he came  back from the moon.  Did he?  Yeah, when he got back, he was all messed up.  Are you sure you're not just spouting off this babble?  He went to the moon, and then what are you going to do now?  What?  Go work at Walmart?  I mean, it's pretty much.  No, you don't go from astronauting to Walmarting.  He came back.  He came back and got all messed up, got his stuff together.  Then he had another book called Return about how he's got his stuff together.  He wants to go back to it.  Yeah, this guy, he was in the Korean conflict, as they call it. 
[01:30:00]  That's what sucks about guys like Buzz Aldrin.  If you go to the moon, you should have special privileges.  You should never have to pay for anything ever again.  Never have to wait in traffic, all that.  He sure gets a few things on the arm, you know?  That Bruce Willis movie, when all the criminals that were going up there, they never want to  pay taxes again.  Pay taxes?  Yeah, but does he have to pay taxes?  He has to pay taxes.  That's completely ridiculous.  He should get free stuff at Applebee's whenever he wants, like a little card.  I went to the moon card. 
[01:30:30]  Very limited.  It's just a picture of a guy floating.  I bet you he has to take out the garbage and all that crap, and he can't even use it.  Still.  I was on the effing moon.  Will you leave me alone?  This is what I did.  I went to the moon.  Did you get the Medal of Freedom?  I was there, and I came back.  Well, Mr. Moon Man.  Yeah.  The lawn's not going to cut itself.  No.  No.  You just know he had one of those in his life.  He probably forgot the rules of the moon don't apply on Earth when he first got back.  So he's in the living room, and he just goes to take a dump, assuming it will float up  and he can catch it. 
[01:31:00]  And his wife's like, what are you doing?  He's like, oh, God.  I forgot.  Do you think he really took a dump in the living room?  Yes, I do.  I do.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  A boy can dream, right?  Jimmy.  Shut up.  Okay, sir.  Remember in stripes?  Okay, sir.  Well, sir, we're on our way to Bingo Parlor.  Shut up.  Okay, sir.  Okay, sir.  My favorite part of that, though, is when they're in the back of that truck, and the  Soviet soldiers come over and point their guns, and they're pointing the guns out of the  truck, and then John Kennedy just goes, okay, boys, pass them forward.  Starts grabbing the guns, giving them to the Russians. 
[01:31:30]  Okay, boys, pass them forward.  Right this way.  Here you go.  He was the greatest.  He was just a funny, fat man.  Yeah.  Funniest fat man ever.  He was funny in horrible movies.  That's not easy to do.  He never had that one big movie to showcase his talent.  Like Uncle Buck was not a great movie, but he was funny.  But he was great in it.  Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.  That was a good one.  That was probably his best one.  Yeah, but you had to deal with Steve Martin.  He was funny, though, because he was playing like an annoying dick.  Yeah, and that's what he is.  And that's when he was Steve Martin, with that stupid, smug, that Neil face. 
[01:32:00]  Like, that's when Steve Martin was really like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  This is a boring white guy who wants to talk about art.  Shut up, wig man.  That stupid thing on your head.  All right.  Greg Giraldo, Robert Kelly in studio, both playing the comedy show Saturday.  I didn't finish mentioning our guest tomorrow.  Oh, who else is coming in, Jimmy?  We have Buzz Aldrin.  We have Pendulet.  And we have, of course, at 10 o'clock, I'm very happy.  We got Sabbath coming in.  What?  Black Sabbath with Ronnie.  They're coming in tomorrow.  Really? 
[01:32:30]  On XM.  Is this interview going to be better than the last time you were in?  Well, the microphones weren't working.  Holy yes, it was a cluster.  Dio was great last time.  He was, but the mics weren't.  The mics were all.  I remember.  Yeah, it was a technical thing.  Who's coming in today?  Any fame?  Any?  You guys.  You're the big get today, Robert.  You're the big get today.  Actually, Giraldo.  You and Giraldo.  You guys are the big gets.  What do I have?  A Carson Daly?  I think he's just Giraldo's the big guest.  I would be dead.  Jesus.  Carson Daly.  I got to plug their signing because they're doing a signing, which I want to plug.  I want to come tomorrow.  Come tomorrow. 
[01:33:00]  You can come by.  Come by.  It's an open door for the most part.  You want to see Buzz?  I just want to sit over there.  All right.  Come on in.  It sounds like you're a big fan of them.  I'm a big fan of Penn and Teller.  I'm a big fan of them.  Oh, come on in tomorrow, Bobby.  Yeah.  That's fine.  Next.  Buzz Aldrin's a pretty good picture, I think, right?  Oh, it's a great one.  Great picture.  You're going to want to have that picture.  It's a great picture.  It's a guy that walked on the goddamn moon.  Yeah, that still doesn't beat my Clinton picture.  Sorry.  Buzz Aldrin?  Sorry.  Sorry.  I don't know.  Sorry.  It's a biggie.  He's contributing.  Neil Armstrong, maybe.  Sorry.  Buzz Aldrin, no. 
[01:33:30]  Why?  The number two guy.  On the moon.  No one remembers the number two guy.  Yes, they do.  Buzz Aldrin.  Every photo on that moon landing, all those photos, every one you've seen is of Buzz Aldrin.  None of them are of Neil Armstrong.  The only photo of Armstrong on that first moon landing is a shot of him fixing the limb.  It was a weird, they didn't plan on Armstrong getting his picture.  I don't know why.  The Buzz forgot his camera.  He didn't have his disposable camera.  Armstrong did.  Disposable camera.  That's why.  Yeah, that's what happened.  That's what happened.  And Armstrong blew his big line.  No, he didn't.  They said he got it right, but it sounds like he blew it. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  But if you listen real close, it sounds like he got it right.  Because everyone thinks he blew it.  Maybe that's the last thing he was thinking of, is sounding good, when you're ready to step  on something that you don't know is going to be quicksand or something.  It still makes sense.  Yeah, I know.  You're ready to step out and some creature bites your foot off.  You're just assuming.  First words, hum-da, hum-da, hum-da.  You're just assuming it's all going to be okay, but you don't know if there's giant  beasts right under the sand.  And the first words from the moon, oh my God, it's got my foot. 
[01:34:30]  Right.  Is Buzz the one that tried to hit the golf ball?  No, that was...  Which one was that?  What's his name?  God damn.  The guy that...  Alan Shepard.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  Alan Shepard did the long moonwalk with this guy who just piped up and said that there's  aliens, right?  The nine-hour moonwalk with this guy, Dr.  Yeah.  Edgar...  Yeah.  Edgar.  Colonel Nelson.  Yeah, Colonel Nelson.  Major Nelson.  Major Nelson.  Well, but then I looked and the girl was... 
[01:35:00]  But then you were...  And...  Oh, Major Nelson.  I wasn't there just a...  But I looked and then a second ago it was...  How was he able to...  The guy was...  Dr. Bellows, he's a doctor and he's going crazy all the time.  How was he able to keep his job?  No.  I think they would have been suspicious.  Yeah.  I, uh...  There's always some broad in his office.  Bank!  She just blinking.  Hi, Master.  This is a genie, but I saw...  And she was wearing...  But...  Oh, you're seeing things again, Dr. Bellows.  Okay, Major Nelson. 
[01:35:30]  They pull the wool over that idiot's eyes every time.  And he was the shrink, wasn't he?  He's the shrink.  You're seeing things again.  You're seeing things again.  Okay, oh.  TV was just so stupid in the 70s.  Oh, here it is.  We're going to have a guy that has a genie.  He's an astronaut.  Yeah.  And she just pops up and gets into wacky things.  Yeah.  All right, we're going to have a comedy.  Yeah.  Based in a Nazi POW camp.  Yeah.  Now, stay with me.  Thank you.  What?  Yes, a Nazi POW camp. 
[01:36:00]  Complete with swastikas and everything for everyone to see.  And Nazis walk around.  But they're...  This is the key.  They're wacky, funny Nazis.  Oh!  See, and these Americans and English soldiers kind of pull fast ones on them all the time.  All right, sold.  What about Gilligan's Island?  Why would you dress up every day?  Well, that's just it.  Why would you dress up if you're going to be on an island for a long, long time?  TV back then.  Why don't you just go nude and go, you know what?  I'm nude.  Sorry. 
[01:36:30]  Gilligan's Island stunk.  It was the worst show on television.  But they had to dress up in their clothes every day.  It was terrible.  And if you saw one of the Lucky episodes, you got to see them in a different outfit.  Oh, thanks.  When they really started running out of stuff and they had to have somebody wash up on shore  in the boat.  And they happened to get off within one episode.  Yeah.  But it's like, you know, all of a sudden, oh, here comes Vincent Price.  This is going to be scary.  He'd wash up or a submarine, a Soviet sub would wash up for their big Cold War episode. 
[01:37:00]  You know, when they got serious, a very special Gilligan's Island.  And then they noticed the homoerotic relationship between Gilligan and the captain.  Oh, Skipper.  Yes.  Whatever he was.  He used Gilligan's face as a humping pillow.  Yeah, why wouldn't you just...  It's an awful show.  Why wouldn't you just pair up at that point?  I think they did.  Yeah.  Girl, the girl guy, girl guy.  They pretty much did.  Why do the girls bunk together and the guys bunk together?  Miss Howell had so much stuff on her back. 
[01:37:30]  She'll be a stegosaurus.  The professor especially.  Very potent man.  Yes.  I think it was insinuated that...  Or it was kind of alluded to that the professor and Marianne had something going on.  I think it was all the ginger.  Ginger and the professor and...  No, no.  Professor Marianne.  She's more like the wholesome one.  No, Marianne.  Ginger was kind of...  No, Marianne.  No, Marianne.  Marianne was the wholesome one that was for Gilligan.  And then Mrs. Howell.  Yeah, she was...  Mrs. Howell was a size queen and preferred gentleman of color to a nun on the island. 
[01:38:00]  No, of course not.  It was the 60s.  She would go on those long walks looking for natives on the other side of the island.  Like if the professor could make a radio...  They could make a radio out of like a coconut, but he couldn't lash two logs together and float away.  Fix the boat.  Yeah.  Professor stunk.  All right.  Why don't we take a break and continue.  I just went off on Gilligan Island jokes for a half hour.  Well, I was trying to do my Sabbath plug, Bob, and you...  All right.  Go ahead, Jerry.  People are confused.  I don't want to see Gilligan naked.  I'm just saying, why would you dress up if you're on a deserted island, you idiot? 
[01:38:30]  People are confused.  I'm like, why are you making that leap?  You're saying he should have something over his stuff.  Maybe just like a banana leaf.  Who makes that mistake, though?  Like, you're saying, why wouldn't they just be naked?  But who actually thinks...  Dude, does he want to see Bob Denver without clothes?  Yeah.  Bob Denver.  The point is, why would you dress up in the clothes every day?  In that stupid hat?  All right.  Walk around with that heavy hat as you're baking away.  Why don't you just sit in Denver and do a mediocre radio show and get busted for pot again 
[01:39:00]  in a game?  Oh, oh, no.  Wait, was he in Denver or not?  Well, his name is Bob Denver.  That's probably where I got that from.  He's dead.  Who wants to take this one?  What?  Do the vocals.  Oh.  Rolling.  I got it.  Since you've been gone, I am free for the first time.  I'm so moving on. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Because of you.  Because of you.  Since you've been gone.  Since you've been gone.  All right.  Bob Kelly.  Tearing up the vocals.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  RobertKelleyLive.com.  Greg Giraldo.  You got a website or something, buddy?  Kind of.  GregGiraldo.com or that MySpace.  Greg Giraldo.  Something or other.  How many friends do you have? 
[01:40:00]  In real life?  Just you, Bob.  Yeah, there is a big drop-off from real life to MySpace.  Yeah.  It's friends and fake friends.  How many fake friends do you have?  I got 10,572 fake friends.  I have 1,000 beautiful eyes.  Is MySpace over these days?  Somebody told me that nobody does it anymore.  I just started.  I really can't even bother.  It's like Facebook.  I cannot be bothered with MySpace anymore.  Facebook is more.  It just turned into a mess. 
[01:40:30]  It's more personal, but you can't have as many friends or something, right?  Yeah, you got 5,000, which is great for most people, but when you're trying to use it  to advertise.  Sure.  And to send out mass notices.  Yeah, but on MySpace, it's hard to send out a bulletin to everybody.  Yeah, I do.  But you got to do it 19 times a day because they just keep getting pushed down.  Yeah.  There's no way to get notified if you get a bulletin?  It comes...  No.  I think it comes up and then it just gets pushed down because as many friends as you have.  Can I get this out because he stepped on me before and I'm really going to... 
[01:41:00]  I apologize.  What happened?  What happened?  Huh?  I wanted to plug the Sabbath thing.  Oh, yeah.  I apologize.  Can I?  Go ahead.  Yeah.  They're coming in tomorrow at 10, but Saturday morning or Saturday afternoon, actually,  they're doing a signing.  It's their new box set.  It's going to be Ronnie, Tony, Vinny, and Geezer, and it's called Black Sabbath, The Rules  of Hell.  It's at Vintage Vinyl, Saturday, August 2nd from 3 to 4 p.m. only.  It's on 51 Lafayette Street in Forge. 
[01:41:30]  And you have to get a wristband.  There's a 500 person maximum.  Wow.  Just go down to the store, buy it, and they'll give you a wristband.  Obviously, it's limited until they're sold out.  But get that on the way down to the virus show because that's what I'm going to do.  Actually, stop in.  That's a great idea.  Go to the signing.  The virus show doors did not open until 530.  Yep.  So on your way down to PNC, stop in and get Black Sabbath to sign the new box set for  you.  Very cool.  Hey, we could do Obama-McCain stuff.  We could do a man getting caught taking upskirt pics.  Or we could do cheerleaders. 
[01:42:00]  You're ready to go with the upskirt, but let me give you the final choice here, Jimmy.  You got cheerleaders that are hazing the new girls.  What, college or high school?  Grammar school.  All right.  Let's go with that story.  Let's say we like that one.  Which one do you want to do?  I say the cheerleader hazing.  Yeah.  A little titillation.  Let's see what they're doing.  A little naughtiness in the show.  What do you say, boys?  Oh, get a little blue.  I don't dare.  Pull over, guys.  Nothing wrong with a little titillation.  It's good, because this is always frat stories, like when things like this happen. 
[01:42:30]  Not hot when they take pinecones to football camp and start abusing the youngsters with  them.  Eh.  Yeah.  Jimmy's like, eh?  He's like, well.  Basically, Jimmy's like, eh, speak for yourself.  Yeah, what's wrong with a pinecone?  Putting the right place shows you who's boss.  Certainly would.  Let's get the...  It's called Riding the Pine.  You're on the bench.  That would give you eco-anxiety.  Yes.  Let's get the really hot girls to now call the O.P. and Anthony show.  And give us their hazing stories from back in the day. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  All the hot, sexy things you did to each other.  That's what we need.  Because you know it's just them and their jammies.  Because it sucks.  Giggling.  Spanking each other.  We go down this road with potential, and next thing you know, you're taking stories from  fat, sweaty guys trying to get into a fraternity.  Who cares?  Bend over and pick up a marshmallow.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  We didn't haze in community college.  We just went home.  Yeah.  Just leave. 
[01:43:30]  After basic math, I just went home.  New tonight, more than a dozen members of a KDISG cheerleading squad stand accused of  taking the hazing of underclassmen way too far.  Oh, way too far.  All right, let me just get started here.  I want to time it so I finish when the story gets real good.  I hope it's sexy.  It's probably not, though.  I bet it isn't.  Yeah.  Really?  Drink toilet water.  Yeah, they made them put curlers in their hair.  Just kept slapping the fat armpit of the fat chick. 
[01:44:00]  Even that's kind of hot.  Yeah?  It takes it hurts.  Way too far.  The mother and sister of one of those younger girls told us the seniors put the underclassmen  in danger.  In a story you won't see anywhere else, you'll hear what happened and what the district  is doing.  When a girl p***s her pants and puts her pants over another girl's head.  All right.  Oh, that's great. 
[01:44:30]  Well, there's two options now.  No kidding.  That's why I'm laughing.  Is it?  I went with option two myself.  Yeah, I instantly thought option number two.  Not meaning number two.  I mean.  No, that's what I thought.  Most people would go with the other option.  I'm going with the second option.  I went with option number two, which is option number two.  Yep.  I didn't go with option number one, which would have been option number one.  Oh, I see.  So I should have been option number one.  Is that what you went with?  Oh, yeah.  Because I thought it was really a mess.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:45:00]  It's so rare that the option numbers and the code match up.  Yeah, they match up.  I know.  That's what I figured.  You're right.  I messed up.  It depends on if it's the winter time.  It would actually be nice to have one of those on your head.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Like a warm helmet.  Yeah.  Warm up with a pudding hat.  It's not pudding.  I was going for the old bloody nose.  Oh, are you?  Okay.  So there's three options.  Oh, yeah.  Could be the third option.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's get back to this hot, sexy story. 
[01:45:30]  Let's back up so we get all the goodness.  Yeah.  Danger.  And a story you won't see anywhere else.  Yeah.  You'll hear what happened and what the district is doing.  Yeah.  When a girl p***s her pants and puts her pants over another girl's head, you know, that's  just disgusting.  This sister of a Morton Ranch High School junior varsity cheerleader describes some of what  she calls hazing that her sister and 13 other JV cheerleaders recently endured.  Oh. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, I think it was option number one.  You could kind of almost hear her say, I heard, I heard too.  I heard like a, like a, like a, yeah, but that wouldn't be disgusting.  No, that made it kind of hot.  Yeah.  But she said it was disgusting.  So it had to be something, can't be what we're thinking.  The mother or sister is going to think it's disgusting.  Obviously we're not.  I don't think it's either option actually. 
[01:46:30]  Hmm.  All right, let's.  Yeah, both at once.  Yeah, exactly.  Big mess.  Ring it out.  With the flu.  After some bad sushi.  Looked like she was in Willy Wonka's joint.  Let's get more of this story on the air.  Yeah.  The JV girls claim the seniors bound them and tossed them into a pool.  Once you duct tape someone's hands, blindfold them, throw them in a pool, you know, start flicking their body parts. 
[01:47:00]  Hmm.  Oh.  It's way too far.  Her mother tonight echoed the same sentiment to us.  Katie IST officials.  Then don't be a cheerleader.  Why are you wrecking it for everyone else?  Yeah.  They've been doing this crap for freaking, who knows?  Body part flicking is a big part of cheerleading.  That's right.  I love that.  Flicking their body parts.  You know what they were flicking, don't you?  I also love that she's saying it like it's the same thing.  So they're duct taping her hand.  They're duct taping her hand and throwing them in a pool.  And they're also touching them. 
[01:47:30]  And they touch them.  They drown them.  All of a sudden, the duct tape and the pool part, I don't even care about.  I could care less if they're drowning.  It's the flicking of the body parts.  Because you know it's the tenderest parts that they're flicking.  You just know it.  Can I go for an obvious dump right now?  Well, because people are saying there's a fourth option.  Can't you work around it?  No, because it's one of our favorite words to say.  Can I write it down at least?  Write it down. 
[01:48:00]  We'll give Barry credit for this one.  I think we should be nice.  One of our favorite words to say.  Yeah, I love saying this.  Does it involve birth?  Here, I'll just pass it around the room.  Oh.  Well, there could be some of that in there.  Yeah, but just how we say it.  Yeah.  Wait, hold on.  One of the most...  It's one of the funnest words to say.  Do you know what me likes about Christmas?  Santa Claus comesies.  Yes, he does. 
[01:48:30]  That's what me likes about Christmas.  Santa Claus comesies.  So there's a fourth option.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  That we can't talk about on the end.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Their body parts, it's way too far.  Her mother tonight echoed the same sentiment to us.  Katie IST officials found out about the alleged incident the next day and told us, quote,  the district is investigating the alleged off-campus incident possibly involving inappropriate behavior by certain students, end quote. 
[01:49:00]  The sister we talked to wants the seniors responsible to face punishment as laid out by the school district.  Ooh, hopefully a spank him.  What's the hamlet says?  Look it up.  Hazing means you get kicked off the team in extracurricular activities.  Tonight, all of the Morton Ranch High School cheerleaders are at a cheer camp at Texas A&M University.  Parents were reportedly told their girls will be safe.  You know what?  Don't join the cheerleading squad.  Stop wrecking it for everyone else. 
[01:49:30]  This crap goes on and everyone enjoys it for the most part.  And then it's your turn next year to abuse the underclass girls to flick some of the youngsters.  Yes.  Flick it.  Well, we got a guy that has a fine perv switch.  Want to go right into the upskirt story?  Oh, I love it.  Upskirts.  Oh, all right.  Wait, we might have a hot story from Jackie in New York City.  Jackie.  Jackie.  Hi.  Hi.  I have a hot story. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, God.  I listen to you guys every day and I'm hysterical laughing.  When I was in college, when I was in my sorority, I would rather not name names, we called our  hands the Colonel because it was finger-licking good.  And we used to make the pledges, Colonel in the Corner.  Colonel in the Corner.  Now, with their own hands or yours?  Their own hands.  We wanted to make sure that they were fit to be in our group. 
[01:50:30]  Oh.  Hey, you got any video?  So they would have to go in the corner.  It was a while ago, so we didn't have our video cameras then.  We just took pictures.  So they would have to go in the corner and dirty their hands?  Yeah, pretty much.  And then, of course, after you dirty your hands, you've got to clean them, right?  Yeah.  Well, the louder you got, the better the reaction of the sisters and so on and so forth. 
[01:51:00]  We had a fun night.  Sounds fantastic.  I don't really understand fraternities and sororities.  And I was a member of one, but it brings out the homosexual in you and the lesbian in you.  It certainly does.  It's the weirdest thing.  It's like, yo, whoa, whoa.  Why is that fine?  Because it's a sorority or a fraternity.  Right.  She just basically told a lesbian story.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's probably not even a lesbian, but you join the sorority or the fraternity, and all 
[01:51:30]  of a sudden, some weird thoughts come out from these brothers.  I don't get it.  I don't either, man.  What are you, like, wake up spooning with one of your fraternity brothers?  I just was a little cold in my bed, a little lonely.  Yeah.  It's okay.  It's okay.  You're pledging, and this is what we do.  We're brothers.  Nothing gay about it.  You're just pledging this fine fraternity.  Both of your breath smells like feet.  All right.  Let's go to the guy in the mall.  Or, uh, Costco.  A Seattle man reportedly catches a suspect in the act of taking a picture of his wife's 
[01:52:00]  dress.  The suspect reportedly took a cell phone photo inside a Costco in South Seattle.  That's where King 5's Tricia Manning-Smith is live with a story tonight.  Tricia.  Dennis, that suspect's cell phone is now locked up as police evidence after the suspect  reportedly...  Locked up so the boys at the precinct...  Yeah, they're mailing it to all their friends.  Right.  Uh, it's evidence.  It's evidence. 
[01:52:30]  Police evidence after the suspect reportedly tried and failed to delete that incriminating  picture.  Oh.  The couple were shopping at this Costco on 4th Avenue South in Seattle.  According to a police report, the man walked to another area of the store Sunday while his  wife was in the camera section.  When he returned, he told police, he saw a 67-year-old man reach down with a cell phone  under his wife's dress, between her legs, and take a picture.  Oh. 
[01:53:00]  At a Costco in Seattle?  Couldn't he have just said he was a picture of a Bigfoot?  You just know.  Why are you doing that?  That's not where the hot girls are hanging out.  Costco in Seattle.  Yeah.  He's 67.  He'd like to think he'd outgrow that.  I'm surprised a 67-year-old guy knows how to work out a camera on a cell phone.  Well, obviously he doesn't.  He's got caught.  How do I delete this?  You know, he went.  Excuse me, officer.  Could you help me?  He's sending it to all his friends. 
[01:53:30]  At the home.  The husband reportedly yelled at the suspect, who attempted to delete the photo.  When the husband tried to grab the phone, the suspect took off running, allegedly with  several employees giving chase.  That suspect could not erase the photo.  So then witnesses say he ripped the phone in half and threw it down an aisle.  Someone grabbed the phone and stored it in the Costco store safe.  The report says that police were called but were unable to respond in a timely manner 
[01:54:00]  and all the participants left.  The victims apparently returned to the Costco the next day and called 911.  Costco would not comment on this incident.  We talked to the Seattle husband and wife who do not want to publicly comment.  Is that amazing?  Get over it.  That was the most detailed news account of it.  The employees grabbed it and put it in the Costco storage safe.  In the safe.  It was a Motorola X90.  Dan G from PA, right? 
[01:54:30]  Can you imagine how hard it would be to delete a picture with your nervous fingers pushing  all kinds of different buttons?  Big fat hands.  It was like, you know you have to get this done and you have literally seconds.  How do you delete a photo while people are chasing you?  Humming to, humming to, humming to, humming to.  All right, what are we doing?  We should take a break, I think.  Greg Giraldo and Robert Kelly doing the big comedy show Saturday, along with Patrice O'Neill  and Norton and Mike Birbiglia and Voss and Otto and George, Mike DiStofano.  Also giving away a car.  Lots going on.  Speaking of the car thing, get ready to text. 
[01:55:00]  Hey, I'll be on the Gong Show tonight with Dave Attell.  I'm a judge.  10 o'clock on Comedy Central.  It's me, Ron White, J.B.  Smoove.  And hopefully it's funny.  It was funny when we did it.  Gene Gene, the legless dancing machine.  Is he coming back?  That was a funny host, though.  Sure.  I can't wait to check it out, Jimmy.  I hope it's good, guys.  What time is it on?  10 p.m. on Comedy Central.  Tonight with Jim North.  Great David Attell, of course.  Very, very good.  Let's check out the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line. 
[01:55:30]  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.  This is Casey from Erie, Pennsylvania.  I'd like to give a big F.U. to Carla, you ignorant little F.U.s.  Leave me the F.U.s alone.  F.U.s up and die.  Next message.  Yeah, I just want to give a huge F.U.s to my F.U.s job.  I really can't stand awake at every 5 o'clock in the morning anymore.  I was about to go quit.  F.U.s you.  Next message.  Yeah, I just want to give a big F.U.s to the New York State Lottery. 
[01:56:00]  I just bought $50 worth of F.U.s tickets.  And I didn't win.  F.U.s so much for my F.U.s money going to support my kids' education.  F.U.s you, New York State Lottery.  Next message.  I just want to give a big old F.U.s to that F.U.s that gave me crap last week.  Those F.U.s are itchy as hell.  I've never had them before.  I don't want them again.  F.U.s you.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to send a big F.U.s out to Steve Guttenberg and his big stupid face.  F.U.s Steve Guttenberg. 
[01:56:30]  Next message.  Hey, guys, I want to give a big F.U.s to my soon-to-be ex-girlfriend who came home yesterday with a serious case of bleach breath.  Man, bitch, I am on to you.  End of new messages.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  It's mop-up time on the O&A show.  Greg Giraldo, Robert Kelly doing a great job with us today.  Jim Norton, of course, is going to be on the Gong Show tonight, 10 o'clock, Comedy Central. 
[01:57:00]  Check that out.  One of the judges.  Yeah, me, Ron White, J.B. Smooth, and Attell.  It's so funny to see Attell in a suit trying to be like a person.  You're such a caustic lunatic.  I want to get David Attell in front of our fans, man.  Dude, I want him on that show so badly.  I would love to have David Attell on the show Saturday.  Is it too late to try to get him?  I don't know where he's working.  I know Dave.  You know, Dave, like, Dave never wants to feel like he's imposing.  Like, he's so weird like that. 
[01:57:30]  He never wants to just walk into your party.  It's like, you should call him.  We want him so bad.  I think he is in town.  Really?  Yeah.  Come on, Dave.  You're getting a call after the show today.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Because the crowd would love him.  Yeah, we could use one more comedian.  We're thinking.  Yeah.  Jimmy, we need an expert opinion.  Sure.  Well, there's a girl on PalTalk and a lot of speculation going on as to if she's a tranny  or not.  Oh.  Really?  Yeah.  Which one?  Very attractive.  This one here.  Mariela. 
[01:58:00]  See, a lot of speculation.  I don't think so.  What do you think?  Tranny?  Hard to say.  She's an Asian girl.  Yeah.  And of all trannies, Asians are normally the most passable because they're very nice skin  and they're very slight.  You know, they're normally the ones that are hardest to tell.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  They're hairless.  Hairless?  Yeah, hairless.  I can't tell with her because she has a little bit of an Adam's apple.  Yeah, is there?  A little bit, it seems like, but...  Tell her to show her hands if she has dirty fingernails and dirty knuckles. 
[01:58:30]  You know, she's doing construction during the day.  Ha, ha, ha.  Construction.  Well...  I'm not going to say yes, though.  I mean, to be honest, there's nothing that would indicate that.  I say yes because the angle's weird.  It is a weird angle, but she could just have a weird face.  It could be, you know...  Well, there's nothing really wrong there.  Covering up some stuff.  Is she in the pal talk room for O&A or they just brought her from somewhere else?  No, she's been here like most of the show.  Does she look like she's listening to the show?  No, I don't think so.  But a lot of people have been trying to get her to, you know, show. 
[01:59:00]  And, you know, show top, bottom, whatever.  And apparently she won't, which is leading people to believe that, of course, guys, when  the girls won't show, they instantly say, it's a guy.  Yeah.  Have her show her neck to see if that Adam's apple's happening.  There's a roll of duct tape right by her leg.  That could be...  Is that a hint?  She said she's a guy?  She is?  What?  She said she has nine.  Nine. 
[01:59:30]  Cut or uncut?  I don't...  Why am I getting excited?  Yeah.  Yeah, really?  No, she's...  And then she says she was joking.  Oh, who knows?  I just thought I'd get Jimmy's expert opinion.  All right.  I think she is.  Listen, we haven't done politics yet.  We got some Obama stuff happening today.  Obama.  That's why you love the show.  Tranny's on Pal Talk to Obama.  To Obama.  That would cover all areas.  The current situation.  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah, if you look at the stuff we do on a daily basis, it's wow.  All over the place.  Well, you got John McCain's new ad, beating up Obama by just making fun of the fact that he's 
[02:00:00]  very, very popular.  Yeah.  I don't really get this move.  Do you?  Well, I could see what he wanted to do, but I think it's backfiring.  He's saying, hey, look at this guy.  He's like a rock star.  Yeah.  Look at him.  Everyone loves him.  He goes out to cheering crowds.  But then he questions, you know, is he qualified?  Does that make someone qualified to be president?  Well, Hillary did the same thing, though, when it worked for her.  Yeah.  Yeah, the SNL stuff.  And she started, you know, he's on SNL.  Then people switched up.  The press switched on him. 
[02:00:30]  How did it work for her?  She's sitting out.  No, I'm not saying it worked.  Looking haggard at this point.  I'm not saying it worked entirely.  I'm saying at the time, the tide switched for her.  The press actually went against Obama for that next couple weeks.  And I think McCain blew it on this one because they show Obama in front of these crowds getting rah-rah and a lot of excitement.  And then they go to, like, a McCain clip, and he's just sitting there, like, in front of, like, a few people just, eh, I'm experienced.  Downhaul.  Well, that's a big Karl Rove thing where they say you've got to go after the guy's strength, which is, like, what they're most known for. 
[02:01:00]  Which is why, like, what Obama did with McCain where he said, okay, you were a very courageous worker.  They had Wesley Clark.  You were a courageous worker, you know, POW, but how about not getting caught in the first place?  It seems like you messed that one up, Luke.  So they were trying to do something like that, saying he's so popular.  This is his strength.  He's so, like, but this is a bizarre thing.  You've got to go after his strength.  He's awesome.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's bring him down.  I think McCain's going to be the next president.  You think McCain now?  No way. 
[02:01:30]  How is that happening?  Why were you saying that?  Because Bush is dropping the, you know, the price of gas.  He's going to start some more conflicts.  Yeah, you think he's just going to, like, mix things up a little to keep the Republicans in?  I think so.  In this commercial, Brittany and Paris Hilton are in it as well.  He's the biggest celebrity in the world.  But is he ready to lead?  With gas prices soaring, Barack Obama says no to offshore drilling and says he'll raise taxes on electricity? 
[02:02:00]  Higher taxes, more foreign oil.  That's the real Obama.  I'm John McCain, and I approve this message.  Now, listen, Ant, I know you're not a big Obama fan, but that's complete BS that they're saying he's going to raise taxes on electricity.  He is.  How would anyone get into office saying that?  Well, he's not saying that. 
[02:02:30]  Right.  He's just, you know, it's part of his plan, though.  Well, and drill, drill for oil everywhere.  No one would run on the platform that they're going to raise taxes on electricity.  He's going to raise taxes on baby formula.  Right.  We're going to stop funding AIDS and cancer research.  But they're saying that it's going to be more foreign oil.  No, because John McCain's not mentioning that Obama's going to fund for alternative energy.  Like, that's where he's going with it.  It's almost like he's saying no offshore drilling.  Let's just keep dealing with these savages that we're dealing with. 
[02:03:00]  But the reality is he's going to be for new alternative energy.  Whether it's going to work or not, he's going to try for something different.  We've got to bite the bullet already.  Well, McCain's making it sound like, yeah, he doesn't mind the fact that gas is for possibly $5,000 a gallon.  Our lives are uncomfortable.  We can't do what we want because it's too expensive when we have a ball of fire that we can harness the energy from and use.  And it's not going out and it's big and it's free.  And it's always, it's a ball of nuclear fire.  And all we do is put on sunglasses so it doesn't hurt. 
[02:03:30]  I really, I'm just a moron because for a second I'm like, where is this ball of fire?  Ball of fire?  Where is this fireball?  Jimmy makes a great point.  It's about time we start paying attention to this massive thing in the sky and figure out how we could use it to our advantage.  It's so strong it keeps all the planets circling around it like little bitches and we can't figure out a way to make a car go 50 on it.  It's so strong that it's able to keep your closet warm.  The temperature in a closet.  All we can figure out though is to store that energy in some type of battery or capacitor. 
[02:04:00]  It's just very odd to, they haven't figured out how to take that energy and store it.  I don't want to drive around with a window.  And then use it in a way that's convenient like fossil fuel.  But I like Jimmy's angle.  Just break it down to the basics.  It's like, when are we going to try to do something with this thing called the sun?  That giant reactor in the sky.  We'd rather dig for dinosaurs. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  We're so stupid.  And meanwhile, our quality of life, we have to depend on people that hate us at a base level.  Instead of just getting big panels and the sun goes through the panel and all of a sudden you're zooming along for nothing.  Well, yeah.  But then what happens on those days where the sun's not out?  It's obviously the way to harness the energy.  That's what I mean.  It's got to be stored in batteries and then you're dealing with batteries again.  People don't like batteries.  You're a party pooper, man.  I like fossil fuel.  We want to do something with the sun.  Drill, drill, drill.  Hey, how about you have the space station which goes around the earth. 
[02:05:00]  What do you think it does?  Shut off when it gets to the side where the sun is not facing?  No.  Lights out.  Their phone calls keep getting cut off.  They store it in their batteries, yeah.  All right, Obama.  But they know that when they come around on the other side, the sun better be there and it better light up the panels again or else their batteries go dead.  What if it's overcast like every day for a week?  Because obviously everybody's going to be walking around going, ah, my car. 
[02:05:30]  Well, that means you're still getting through.  Yeah, and that means you use the wind at that point.  So your car's going to look like crap.  It's going to have a big window on it and a propeller.  Big stupid solar panels on it.  Big square box.  Someone will key your solar panel.  It won't work.  It's going to look like an iPod.  Yeah.  Stupid car.  Who cares what the cars look like, though?  We're such an idiot.  What?  No, not an important one.  Let me tell you.  It's America.  Americans care what their cars look like.  They've got to look cool.  That's why these hybrids aren't doing as well as they should be. 
[02:06:00]  They've got to sound cool.  You want to...  Right.  You want an internal combustion engine.  That's the biggest mistake they made.  With hitters.  They didn't make the hybrid car look cool.  Yep.  It looks like...  They've got a cool one in those Japanese...  They're getting there, buddy.  They've got one that turns the whole body just...  You don't have to back out.  The whole inside turns.  And then you just pull out that way.  So lame.  That is lame.  That's great.  I love that.  You don't have to back out.  I could trot into stereotype territory here, but I don't think I need that. 
[02:06:30]  I can park pretty well.  I love zooming around in the car.  You face one way.  How great is that?  I whip that friggin' Escalade into a space where people constantly tell me,  that's not enough room.  Oh, yeah?  Go watch me, bastard.  Watch me.  But you play bumper cars.  No, I don't.  I got my little camera in the back.  It goes, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  And I just about get an inch away from the bumper, and I'm back in.  New Yorkers love to play bumper cars.  It is unbelievable what they'll do to get into a spot.  Listen, I've got to jump back in because we're running out of time.  Obama responds to the ad.  And we came back yesterday. 
[02:07:00]  A moment ago, NBC's Mike Memley caught up with Barack Obama  and asked him about McCain's recent ad comparing Obama to a celebrity like Britney Spears.  Here's Obama's reaction.  You know, I don't pay attention to John McCain's ads.  Although I do notice that he doesn't seem to have anything very positive to say about himself, does he?  He doesn't.  He seems to only be talking about me.  You need to ask John McCain what he's for, not just what he's against me.  Well, no, not really. 
[02:07:30]  You kind of do.  If you're the least bit educated on the election, you kind of know where McCain stands on a lot of issues.  I mean, where does Obama stand?  He's a guy that's kind of more a cult of personality.  We asked people.  Sam went out on the street and asked people why they're voting for Obama.  And they couldn't tell you.  They couldn't tell you one thing this guy is for?  Oh, change.  What does that mean?  You know, give me an answer.  What is your stance on taxes?  You're going to raise the goddamn things.  I know, because he's a Democrat. 
[02:08:00]  What's your stance on the Second Amendment, you son of a bitch?  He's going to try to take away everybody's right to shoot people.  Anthony rocks.  We got the Obama commercial.  Let's see what he's about.  He's practicing the politics of the past.  John McCain.  His attacks on Barack Obama?  Not true.  False.  Baloney.  The low road.  Baseless.  John McCain.  Same old politics.  Same failed policies.  Barack Obama supports a $1,000 middle class tax cut. 
[02:08:30]  An energy plan that takes on oil companies, develops alternative fuels, and breaks the grip of foreign oil.  That's change we can believe in.  I'm Barack Obama, and I approve this message.  All right.  That sounds good.  Good alternative energy.  Yeah.  Like the depressing, scary music in the back.  And then it gets...  And then it gets...  And then it gets...  And then it gets...  And then it gets...  And then it gets...  And then it gets...  And then it gets...  And then it gets...  And then it gets...  Yeah, the cape on, standing on the rock.  John McCain wants to kill the firstborn of every Jew. 
[02:09:00]  What?  Yeah.  Does he want to do that?  I can't vote for him.  That's crazy.  And they're playing scary music, so it's got to be true.  Barack Obama's going to fly around the planet until it rewinds.  Yes.  So he can fix our problems.  Back in time, because he's Superman.  John McCain eats puppies.  We love the political ads.  We can't get enough of them.  John McCain, doesn't he have like that little...  That little...  When he says S words when he speaks.  He's a mess. 
[02:09:30]  He has that little...  Yeah, it might have come from the butt of a Vietnamese rifle hitting him in the mouth a few times.  They finally told him to lose the sweater vests.  Because I could remember he was still clinging to that.  They showed up like Barack Obama speaking in front of 200,000 people.  And he cut to like...  You know, McCain's in a sweater vest and like a Holiday Inn.  And a diner.  Yeah.  Some rubes eating with him.  And there's freaking Barack Obama in front of a U2 crowd.  Playing the long neck bass with his tie wrapped around his head like Hendrix. 
[02:10:00]  He's doing Hendrix.  He's burning a guitar.  People are going crazy.  Yeah.  Hey, but Obama said something a little weird.  Did he?  And we're going to end with this today.  Listen.  Yeah, how to save a little energy.  Things that you can do individually, though, to save energy.  Making sure your tires are properly inflated.  Simple thing.  But we could save all the oil that they're talking about getting off drilling.  If everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune-ups, you could actually 
[02:10:30]  save just as much.  You could save a little.  A little bit.  A couple shot glasses.  Of fuel.  Boy, if McCain doesn't isolate that.  No kidding.  That's the whole thing.  Just inflate your tires.  Inflate your tires and get tune-ups.  Because it would be awesome if it was, if that was really all we had to do.  Walk around with your tire pressure gauges, everybody.  Obama's answer to the energy crisis. 
[02:11:00]  Inflate your tires.  Yeah.  Inflate your tires.  The money you're spending on.  Oh, that would be great, right?  The money you're spending on regular tune-ups.  You're still spending money.  Let me tell you something about.  We just want to spend less money is what it comes up.  Tell you something about the tune-up.  First of all.  They don't exist.  There's no tune-ups anymore.  No new cars get tune-ups.  And what do they do in a tune-up?  They drain your oil and put in more.  Yeah.  That's the only thing, the maintenance that's done on your cars. 
[02:11:30]  It's an oil change that is done.  You're wasting oil.  Every few miles.  But as far as tune-ups go, what?  Spark plugs?  25,000 miles.  Yeah.  You're fine.  I love that you get it.  Tune-up.  Get your points.  You guys are actually...  Work on your points.  Yeah.  I got to gap my points.  I'm under the hood, getting my hands all greasy.  Barack thinks everyone's driving a 75 Chevelle.  What the hell is going on?  Service your solenoid.  Yeah.  What is that?  Ah, my starter won't start. 
[02:12:00]  I got to get underneath with the hammer.  It's one of those situations where he doesn't know.  Now, if there's a problem with your car, you go, they pop out a module and pop a new  one in.  Everything's fine.  It's all injectors and little tune-ups.  What are you tuning up?  Yeah, everybody has an injector and not everybody drives, you know, this really isn't affecting  you.  Everybody...  Let me tell you something.  Even the old cars don't have the crap that you need to get under there and...  It's got a slant six.  Yeah.  I got a slant six.  I got to go to Autobahn and pick up some plugs. 
[02:12:30]  I used to do that.  I fixed my car with a stick once.  You don't do it anymore?  Yeah.  I've done things like that.  The belt came off.  I just grabbed a twig and jammed it back on.  My engine mounts broke.  My tranny mounts broke.  And the engine tipped backwards until the distributor cap hit the firewall and bent  so it wouldn't...  The timing was all off.  So instead of fixing the mount, I took tin snips and snipped the firewall away behind  the distributor so it would sit in the firewall. 
[02:13:00]  And drove until the engine fell out.  It's called Obama...  I'll dump that.  Oh, yes, Ted?  Yeah?  I see Ted wants to say something.  No, I don't.  I'm just sad.  Why are you sad, Ted?  I have eco-anxiety.  You still have the eco...  I do.  I need to go home and rub my nude body with juniper berries. 
[02:13:30]  Juniper berries.  I've thrown out my toilet paper.  Why?  I've replaced it with a bucket of elm book.  Sometimes there are bees on it, too.  I should have quit while I was ahead.  Hard to follow juniper berries.  Boo.  I'm a boo.  All right, listen.  Greg Giraldo, thank you.  Robert Kelly, thank you.  We'll see you Saturday at the Big Comedy Show at the PNC Bank Art Center in Homedale,  New Jersey.  Yes, Jimmy?  Off to Sirius XM. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, that's right.  And Jimmy's going to be on the Gong Show tonight at 10 o'clock on Comedy Central as one of the  judges.  One of the celebrity judges, Obey.  That's right.  We're off to...  What is it called now?  Sirius XM.  Radio.  Radio.  Sirius XM Radio.  Yep.  They need to fix the logo instead of using the two old ones.  Get a noose new fresh...  A noose new.  They need to fix the name, too.  Right away, you need a fresh logo.  Right away, you're getting fresh.  All right.  That was great.  That was awesome.  Bye, everyone.  Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye. 
[02:14:30]  The Obey and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  Before you get pissed off at us, man, we have nothing to do with this.  What?  What is this?  Garbage!  You know what?  I can't take this anymore.  It's an awful, awful radio show.  We're really, really mean-spirited, evil people who can't see the good in anything.  Off the air.  Let's say racist things to each other.  All right.  Hold on, hold on.  And really turn them off.  Excellence in broadcasting. 
[02:15:00]  Our anus.  What?  Again?  Oh, oh.  Our anus.  What?  Stop.  Enough about the anus.  Ah, this is hurtful.  This is hurtful.  No one wants to hear this on their radio show.  Come collapse on our floor.  It's just potty mouth day.  You may feel shame, but all the same, you are 90s in pain. 
[02:15:30]  Obey.  Anthony.  Jim Norton.  You guys ready to laugh?  It's got to be the greatest thing ever.  I'd sooner have a water drinking contest.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:16:00]  Good morning, people.  Oh, yeah.  It's still morning.  Also, good morning to all the people listening to us at Sirius.  Well, they're listening.  Isn't that the same company?  Uh, yeah, but it's two kind of separate companies, sort of, still.  Because, like, you have two separate units.  Until we start sharing program, then I would acknowledge that we're kind of one big happy family.  But I did get word yesterday that the bigwigs are taking a little look-see. 
[02:16:30]  Should have played best of.  Yeah, no kidding.  So, they're listening over there.  Oh, hi.  How you doing?  Our old boss called yesterday.  Call in.  Remember Jeremy?  Yeah.  Jimmy, he called to say hi yesterday.  He thinks I don't like him.  Ah, well.  What?  You did say some awful things about him.  Did you?  I was just awful.  I was just mad because I thought he, like, he didn't help me out. 
[02:17:00]  But as far as, like, he really thinks I actively don't like him.  Like, that's not true.  Look, let's face it.  We said awful things about everybody.  Sure.  We really did.  We were in the heat of competition.  In a very competitive business with our futures hanging in the balance.  So, everyone said very nasty things about each other's company and the employees they're in.  And so, what are you going to do?  So, now we're merged.  We're one company.  And what do you want from me? 
[02:17:30]  And we'll see what happens.  And now you're drinking champagne cocktails in the Sierra Mountains.  I worked at N.E.W. with his father.  His father, but, uh...  You know how many times I said to Mel Carmisen off mic yesterday,  Ah, you know it's entertainment.  We're just trying to entertain.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Because he called us out on a few things.  I'm like, Ah, Mel, you should know better than anyone.  This is entertainment.  We're just trying to entertain.  And he, you know something, though?  He does know. 
[02:18:00]  He gets it.  The guy knows what this type of radio is all about.  He gets it to a point.  He was, uh...  He just, uh, you know, he's a money guy.  Sure.  He was a great guest, man.  Honestly, he was fun.  I mean, let's be honest.  We were all trying not to say the stupid wrong thing,  but, uh...  He was very engaging, and, uh...  It was almost like that's the most time I've ever spent with a boss.  It has been.  It has been.  I've never spent that much time with a guy who could, uh...  Who could fire me immediately.  Not even Elo.  I mean, we spent, like, brief periods of time,  but never for 45 minutes on the air.  45 minutes like that on the air. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, I mean, uh, initially...  What's his name?  Who was the guy that was in charge of XM when we first got here?  Hugh Pinero.  Hugh Pinero.  I mean, what?  We didn't get two seconds with him,  and the second you open your mouth to say something,  he'd start talking.  He never wanted to listen to anything that was being said.  That's one thing I noticed about him.  Our first meeting was awful with him.  Yeah.  His opening line was, uh...  I'm not a fan of you guys,  but I understand why it will work for XM's satellite radio. 
[02:19:00]  I'm like, wow.  Thanks.  Wow, thanks for that.  And then Nate?  I didn't hear...  We had one meeting with Nate.  Nate Davis, who's now leaving the company as well.  Yeah, we had one meeting with Nate.  Yeah.  And that...  I think that was a little strained,  to tell you the truth,  because I don't think we agreed on certain policies  of certain content  that was allowed on our show  and should be steered away from on our show.  Well, the one meeting we had with him 
[02:19:30]  was right around the Imus controversy,  and he openly said that he would have fired Imus as well,  and I'm like, oof.  Yeah.  All right, I'm just going to keep my mouth shut right now  and just nod a lot.  Wait for Mel to take over.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  At that point,  it wasn't a bad thing  that we knew a merger was going through  and Mel would be the boss,  because Mel absolutely wouldn't have fired Imus.  I don't think he would have.  In the fucking way, he would have.  He just wouldn't have.  Unless the advertisers really started completely bailing,  then from a business standpoint,  he would have said, 
[02:20:00]  wow, this isn't good business for me.  That's why I got to get rid of him.  Not because of what Imus said.  See, Mel doesn't give off CEO energy.  He gives off like he's a regular dude.  He's a guy, but he's a CEO.  He doesn't give off that you can't connect with energy.  Most of those guys,  you feel like you never live...  Be a GM sitting in one of his meetings  when he's asking about  how much the station builds.  Oh, yeah.  Those poor bastards.  Yeah, we got to see fun, Mel.  Not, you know,  I'm boss Mel or business Mel. 
[02:20:30]  We got to see...  That's as fun as he gets.  Yeah, that's it.  Look, I'm sure he wields a hammer  when he has to.  Oh, yeah.  If you don't run Viacom.  He was refusing to have...  I mentioned the Charlie Rose interview.  Yes, I remember that question.  It was a fun moment.  But in that interview,  Charlie Rose kind of pinned him  because he was like,  no, he's like,  you never went out to dinner  with Sumner Redstone.  He looks at things like,  it's family.  Right.  And I just go out.  And Mel's like,  well, I was busy.  You know, I couldn't have time.  And Charlie Rose says,  you didn't want to go out  to dinner with him.  He's like, no, I didn't.  Like, he just refused to eat  with Sumner Redstone. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  When he was the boss.  Yeah.  And I love that,  which means I have no shot  at a dinner.  I actually...  This is how pathetic I am.  I had a closing yesterday  on my storage unit  and I said to Ope,  dude, he's coming in at 930.  Will we be done by 12?  There was a part of me  that thought,  Mel may go,  let's grab some lunch.  Holy mackerel,  are you delusional?  Yes, I really...  I honestly thought,  he might have said,  look, we're having  an intercompany lunch.  We'd love you to be a...  Yeah, come and show up  for lunch.  Sounds like something  I'd think.  We've known him off and on  for 10 years  and he once offered us 
[02:21:30]  a bottle of water.  A bottle of water  in the office.  Yeah.  That's as social  as he's going to get with you.  My goal with this new company  is to dine with him once.  Yeah, that'll happen.  Even if I just find out  where he's eating  and show up in the restaurant,  give him a quick nod.  Like a creepy stalker.  I'm hearing rumors  that today is  Eric Logan's official last day.  Is it?  Which makes me very, very sad.  Aww.  Bye-bye.  Very, very sad.  Poor Elo.  Poor Elo.  He's going into a great gig.  And he better do the right thing 
[02:22:00]  and just call the show  and say your mom's box.  And that's it.  Yeah?  He better do the right thing today  for the Pess and us.  Aww.  Yeah.  It's bittersweet.  Yeah.  All this excitement  with satellite radio  and he's moving on.  That blows.  Nobody's going to  fucking Oprah's company.  Nah, it's great for him,  you know.  But I think part of him  wishes he was staying  to see what's going to happen next  with this whole thing.  Hey, we got George Carlin's  brother on the phone.  Oh, good.  Hey, Patrick.  Yeah, what's happening?  We've never met you before,  but your brother 
[02:22:30]  used to talk highly of you.  I know that and me of him.  Yeah, and George used to do  our show from time to time  and he was one of our  favorite guests.  We all just love the guy  and obviously,  sorry for his passing there.  Absolutely.  I know that  and we got past it  and, you know,  he was funny right  until the end, man.  He left instructions  and you can Google them up  on georgecarlin.com  but I got a copy of them  right here.  Okay.  And it was his final instructions 
[02:23:00]  upon his death.  He wished to be cremated  and he went through  all of this, you know,  and how he wanted  the disposition of his ashes  and he's gotten  parenthesis dispersal.  And then the last paragraph  he had was,  the exact nature  of the gathering  shall be determined  by my surviving family.  It should be extremely informal.  They should play  rhythm and blues music  and they should laugh a lot.  And vague references  to spirituality,  parenthesis secular,  will be permitted. 
[02:23:30]  I mean, man,  right till the end  he made it easy  for everybody else.  You know what I'm saying?  Well, the last thing he shot,  you're promoting,  there's a CD  of his last special,  I think it's bad for you.  That's right.  And I was shot,  I think it was March 2008  and it was really good.  I mean, it wasn't like,  well, let's just watch Carla.  It was like,  God damn it.  He was really funny.  He was still rocking.  Yeah, he came in  to promote that taping.  I gotta tell you,  the cut on that,  that I like the best  and I saw him  on St. Patrick's Eve  up here in Kingston 
[02:24:00]  and it was just dynamite, man,  because the people love him,  you know.  And he gets in  and does that last one,  I'm a modern man  and it's,  you guys are music guys.  It's got rhythm  and it starts cooking.  And that's my favorite cut  of that last CD.  Hey, Patrick,  I gotta ask you,  no one knew he was sick.  I mean,  he did our show  right around,  not,  yeah,  not that long ago.  He came in,  he looked healthy  as an ox or whatever. 
[02:24:30]  Yes.  And no one had a clue  that he was,  he was on his way out.  What,  his heart was starting  to fail him?  I think his daughter,  Kelly,  knew how serious it was.  Now me,  he could keep me out  in the ether,  you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  And he had his first  heart attack in 78  and he got a stent  and then something  happened again,  81 or something,  he got another stent  and he would always say  to me like,  yeah,  I'm going in for a tune-up,  man,  I'm on my way  to the cardio guy  and he'd be talking 
[02:25:00]  in the car  on his way  in to get these things done  and he made light  of it with me,  you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  And I'm an easy sail,  you know,  I'm looking,  I'm looking for the pony  when you give me  the little bag  of droppings there  and he kept me out  in the woods  on this thing.  The last time  we spoke of it,  now,  over the years,  that's 30 years  the guy fought  this heart thing  and over the years  he picked up  a defibrillator  and a pacemaker  and another stent  and you know,  every time,  he never showed 
[02:25:30]  any pain  or discomfort.  I mean,  he was so courageous,  you know what I'm saying?  Yeah,  I mean,  I saw him many times  and he rocked the stage.  You didn't have a clue  that the guy  had heart problems  as he worked the crowd  in that stage  like he did.  Absolutely,  and he would take  all these medications  and keep the blood thin  and eat,  you know,  chicken breasts  and stuff.  I mean,  I remember  when his breakfast  was a can of beer  and a joint.  Back at all 519,  121st,  I got in there  one morning,  I said,  nice breakfast,  man.  He says, 
[02:26:00]  yeah,  yeah.  And,  I mean,  he was cool  and he kept it  all controlled  and he kept me BS'd,  you know what I'm saying?  Are you older  or younger brother?  I'm five years older.  He especially just did,  he seemed healthier  and it's bad for you.  What was the special  he did before,  which was how he was  standing like in a cemetery?  Oh,  that is my favorite,  that is my favorite picture.  And me and my wife  were just looking at it  and that's from the one,  life is worth losing,  okay?  And he's sitting, 
[02:26:30]  I'm looking at one  of the promo things  for an HBO on that one.  I tore it out of some magazine.  I got it up on the wall here  and he's got a look  on his face,  you guys,  like the left eyebrow  is cocked  and a small smile.  It's just dynamite.  Is that him in the cemetery?  The next to the last special,  right?  That would be probably  the next to the last.  Life is worth losing.  Hey, Patrick,  I got kind of an observation here.  Now,  very tragic,  you lost your brother,  but you seem  extremely positive about it. 
[02:27:00]  I'm going to tell you why,  man.  Because the first couple  of weeks were grim,  okay?  Okay.  When my boy,  I mean,  I had just been on the  email thing with him,  he finally dragged me  into the computer world  and my son Dennis  bought me a little laptop  and we'd been emailing  maybe about a year or so.  Besides regular talking  and all,  you know,  he would phone from anywhere.  And when Dennis  gave me the word,  I mean,  man,  I just,  you know,  you just,  you go to pieces,  you fall on the ground,  you're wrecked,  it's rotten.  I was just going 
[02:27:30]  through a little thing here,  you know,  my own.  But I am so upbeat  because of the way  he presented it,  you know what I'm saying?  He made the ashes  thing fun.  We took the ashes  up to 120th  and Riverside Drive  and put some  where he smoked  his first joint  when he was 13.  That's awesome.  All right.  We took some down  to Birdland  where he got  Charlie Parker's  autograph  when he was  a young dude  wearing electric  blue peg pants  with gray pistol  pockets, 
[02:28:00]  you know?  And we took some  up to a camp  where he won  five drama awards  five years in a row.  And then  we came back here  where I'm living  like,  I'm living in  Saugerties,  New York  up in the woods,  all right?  Sure.  He told me  when it was retiring time,  he says,  go back east  and find something  you like  and we'll buy it,  man.  So here I am  in the woods  and we went  to the creek  and Kelly put  the ashes down  in the creek  which was dry,  okay?  It started raining  30 minutes  after they headed 
[02:28:30]  to New York  to go back  and go to JFK  for the coast.  And it kept raining  until the thing  got churning  and now that water  has taken his ashes  down the Esopus Creek  to the Hudson River,  down the Hudson,  out the harbor,  into the Japanese  current,  up through the  North Atlantic,  south of Iceland,  down the coast  and his ashes  are going to Ireland.  They're going  to wash up there  just like the coconuts  do from Trinidad  and Tobago  and stuff,  you know?  And he's going  to be on Ireland  where he just  became a citizen. 
[02:29:00]  So, George actually,  the first one  you dropped it in  were these little  weird places  that meant something  to him.  Yeah.  That's a pretty cool,  especially the autograph one.  That's one you wouldn't think.  Like, you would think only...  My son thought of that.  My son Dennis  thought of that.  Oh, this was Dennis's  and your idea?  No, and Kelly's.  It was a family idea.  George said  on the dispersal thing,  he said,  I wish to be cremated.  The disposition  of my ashes  at sea,  on land,  or in the air  shall be determined  by my surviving family 
[02:29:30]  in accordance  with their knowledge  of my prejudices  and philosophies  regarding geography  and spirituality.  Under no circumstances  are my ashes  to be retained  by anyone  or buried  in a particular location.  The eventual dispersal  can be delayed  for any reasonable length  of time required  to reach a decision  but not to exceed  one month  following my death.  Hey, was there anything...  What was it...  I mean, he was so...  Especially as comedians,  I mean, Carlin was so... 
[02:30:00]  He was so above us all.  He was a god to comedians.  I mean, none of us felt like  we were in the same business  as him.  What is something about him  or what was something  private about him  or just that most people  wouldn't know?  I mean, he was like an entity.  You couldn't even look at Carlin  as a guy almost  when you were as a comic.  Ah, I wish you'd met him  because...  Have you?  Yeah, yeah.  I met him a couple times.  Because he's not that way.  He ain't special.  He's right on the corner  of on 23rd and Amsterdam, man.  He's as real as mud. 
[02:30:30]  Patrick, just so you know,  you've got Jim Norton  in the studio  who actually did  a skit with George Carlin  on Tough Crowd.  And you've got two other  comedians in the studio today,  Robert Kelly  and Greg Giraldo.  Greg and I actually  did it with George.  It was Tough Crowd.  Colin was the host.  And the four comedians  that day were Greg,  myself, George,  and a guy named Nick DiPaolo.  Uh-huh.  And during the Act 3 sketch,  it was Carlin was playing a priest.  Him and Colin were priests.  And I get to walk in  and break the fourth wall  with an album  and dress as an altar boy 
[02:31:00]  and ask George to sign it.  And then he said something to me  and he called us  cocksucking motherfuckers  and he walked off his camera  and they bleeped it.  It was great.  I have a photo with him.  I'm dressed like an altar boy.  He's dressed like a priest.  It's my fucking greatest celebrity photo.  That's beautiful, man.  He enjoyed doing that  to Cardinal Glick, too,  in Dogma.  Oh, of course.  Kevin Smith wrote  a nice thing about him.  I want to say  it was in Newsweek.  Yeah.  It was kind of like  a nice little eulogy  to George in Newsweek, I think.  I got a little bronze statue 
[02:31:30]  about three feet high  in my dining room  of Cardinal Glick  that Kevin had made  for George as a gift.  That's great.  And we trucked it up here  from after he was doing  Jersey Girl, you know.  So, but, no,  he was always the same guy.  The only thing  that people might not know,  but you'd certainly  have to suspect it,  was that he worked  on his material  and honed it down.  Oh, obviously.  Yeah, I mean,  he was never the kind of guy  to sit and stare  at a newspaper  or stare at the blank sheet  and wait for a thought. 
[02:32:00]  I'd go down to see him  in Atlantic City  and we'd maybe hang out  for the weekend  because that was  a good place to goof.  And he'd have  little yellow things  all over his desk  right near his computer.  He was computing  for years, you know.  He used to call me  a buddite.  And he'd have  these things there  with Swedish pretzels  and Irish pearls  and stuff.  And it all meant  something to him  and it would pop up  later as a big paragraph.  Hey, Patrick,  you sound a lot  like your brother,  just maybe a little  more New Yorkish  than George did. 
[02:32:30]  It's creepy at times.  George and I,  the voice thing,  we had to be careful.  I mean,  one time, you know,  I was dating  and I'm married  to her now.  But my wife,  Marlene,  called and she started  and she said,  wait, wait, wait,  this is George,  you know.  That was back  in the 50s.  And I'd get his  girlfriends and tell them,  wait,  and my mom could never tell.  Really?  Yeah.  She could never tell  on the phone, man.  You guys should have  like, you know,  you should have done  some of the George  Crowley interviews,  radio interviews.  Let him rest.  Oh, no.  He had his thing to do 
[02:33:00]  and I knew it  early on, man.  But he always included me,  you know,  in everything.  Hey, Patrick,  what do you do  for a living?  Well,  I'm up here  in the woods  and, you know,  I got a thing,  I got a book I wrote.  A manifesto?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  It's too lighthearted  for that.  You know,  it's a little book  about how it was  to be in 1952  in Michigan.  And George, 
[02:33:30]  if you look  at the Google thing,  I really hate  to talk about my book  when I want  to talk about George,  but he did love  the damn thing,  you know.  And it's called  Highway 23  and it's around,  you know,  but it's a self-published  thing,  but I really would  prefer to talk  about George.  Yeah, right on.  Okay.  Hey, what do you miss  about George the most?  Ah, just him.  I'm going to tell you.  He would phone  at any hour of the day,  you know what I'm saying?  And it would be,  you'd hear this,  you'd hear,  hey there.  And I would,  my whole mood, 
[02:34:00]  I don't care  if the bridge  had broken.  My whole mood  just elevated,  man.  And I'd say,  hey, what's up?  Well, I'm on San Vicente  right now.  And that was it, man.  He just,  he just was in my soul.  And, you know,  the other day,  you guys saw him,  he always had that jacket,  NFL on CBS,  right?  Yeah.  And that would be  his trademark.  I'd go to see him  in Red Bank,  New Jersey,  or up here  in Turning Stone 
[02:34:30]  or some Indian  reservation or something.  God bless him,  I hope they win  the country back.  But I would go see him  and he'd always have  that jacket on,  right?  And I was driving  to Kingston  the other morning  and I didn't have  the radio on  or nothing,  I was just thinking.  And I, like,  pictured him  sitting next to me  in that jacket.  And you guys  are way too young  to remember movies  called Topper.  But it was about  a guy who got killed  in a car wreck,  a young couple,  and they would come back  and talk to this  one guy, Topper. 
[02:35:00]  And it was like,  he was, you know,  it's just really great,  man, because  he's here with me.  Yeah.  I hope it didn't scare you.  No, not at all, man.  Put him on the phone.  It's just very interesting  to listen to.  Yeah, if he's there with you,  put him on the phone.  Yeah, that's what  I am going to say.  To talk to him.  Okay, man,  say a couple of words  to these guys, George.  You know what the beauty...  All right, blow it out  your ass, you dickheads.  Whoa.  You know, one of the  great things about  your brother, too,  was it was just comedically  how he never went 
[02:35:30]  the predictable angle.  Like, he just really  wouldn't, like,  even the beheadings,  and that was in  Life is Worth Losing.  Yeah.  Where he was saying  how tragic they are,  they're having their heads  cut off,  and he went,  fuck him.  Stay out of another  man's country, Jack.  Yeah.  And I was like,  goddammit,  I wish I had said  those words.  What a fucking  great comic thing  to say.  Ah, yeah.  Fuck him.  But he never took  the predictable way.  That's the truth.  Never.  That is the truth, man.  And he had this gift 
[02:36:00]  of being able to,  I mean,  he was never preachy,  like, even when he was,  even when he was  getting to a point,  he would,  A, always make you laugh,  but there were times  where you didn't even  mind just hearing  his take on things  because he was so  brilliant that his  take on things  would actually affect  the way you looked  at them in real life.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And I got like,  you know,  he was born a Catholic  and raised a Catholic  and kicked off the choir boys,  kicked off the,  you know,  the whole trip, man.  But our friends  who went to sprinkle  some of his asses 
[02:36:30]  around and stuff,  they're people that still  go to Catholic church  and go to mass  and everything,  and they still love  that one where he talks  about there's a big man  up in the sky.  And they love that.  You know,  his take on religion  and God was just  amazing.  Speaking of that,  was George scared  of dying?  God, no.  Not a bit.  I hope I'm that  courageous man.  I really do.  He did not give a damn  right from the beginning  until the end. 
[02:37:00]  Because a lot of people,  when they don't believe  in God,  it makes it a little  more scary.  Because the people  that believe in God,  they're like,  well, at least there  might be something  after this.  So hold on to that hope.  No.  Our family took the  bummer out of that.  There are obscure things  here and there  where he's doing  an interview  and he'll refer  to the big electron.  Right.  And that's a thing  that we talked about,  the big electron  being this electron  that blew up  and started the Big Bang,  okay?  And the big electron  is the whole universe.  And a man asked me 
[02:37:30]  yesterday,  where do I think  George is right now?  I think he's up  in the cosmos,  okay?  And his molecules  and stuff were around  and ashes are blowing  just like Julius Caesar's  and all the old dead people.  And that's all  just part of the universe,  man.  And Nate,  the universe is like  billions of years  you're talking about.  He could condense  and he could cause  an asteroid  that could come back  and wreck the whole  damn thing.  I'm sure he'd love that,  too.  He would.  No kidding.  He would.  Do you know,  one of the,  oh, 
[02:38:00]  fuck,  I just lost my thought.  No,  you didn't.  God damn  the thought of me.  It'll come back.  It's up in the cosmos,  man.  I know.  It's in the toilet.  I had a good one,  too.  It just fucking  completely left my brain.  I'm still creeped out  by the fact that  George Carlin's ashes  are in the Hudson River  somewhere,  and I don't want any  George Carlin  in my eyes or anything.  Let me tell you something.  All of a sudden,  the wind kicks up  and I got some George  in my eyes.  He's got a little  Carlin on you.  We were throwing his ashes  over the wall  at Riverside Drive. 
[02:38:30]  Some of it blew back  onto some of the ladies  and they were so happy,  man.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And it was just,  you know,  it's a thing like  the Hudson.  He used to swim  in the Hudson,  same as I did and all.  And you know,  the Hudson is full of  condoms and turds,  right?  Well,  he had a great joke  about that  and you were all diseased.  He's like,  that's why,  he's like,  we would jump in the river,  you know,  to cool off.  He said we were tempered  and raw shit.  Yeah.  And that's why  they had such strong  immune systems.  Let me tell you about that,  man.  Nobody in our corner 
[02:39:00]  or our neighborhood  or anything  ever got polio.  Ever,  never,  man,  because we believed  that swimming in the river  gave you natural immunities.  I got a buddy in California,  Eddie Hornby,  and we still laugh  about that swimming  in the river thing  and George and I loved it.  When you would go  to swim in the river,  say there were six of you,  okay,  and you go down  to 123rd  and you're on the other side  of the West Side Highway  and it's not as manicured  as it was,  you know,  then it was very nice.  Now it's proper looking 
[02:39:30]  with a path  for bike riders  and stuff.  But you'd get down there  and you'd go swimming  and you would choose fingers  to see who would go first.  And the first guy  would throw like a big rock  through this thing  that was about  12 feet out.  We called it  the shit line.  You had like turds,  you had condoms,  you had pieces of wood,  orange peels,  diesel fuel,  and all of this  floating along.  The second kid  would then do a cannonball  and the third one  a cannonball.  If you were like  the fourth,  fifth or sixth kid, 
[02:40:00]  you could get  a clean shot through  to swim out  past the shit time.  And then you're okay  because of the people  that go by  on the day line  and you could moon them,  right?  But now you come back  and it's time  to swim in  and you've got to get  past the shit line  and you're on your own  coming in.  So you did,  you put your hands  up in front of your face  and then you swept  them outward  and you swept  them outward  and that was called  the Hudson Crawl.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, sweeping them  aside, man.  Sweeping up,  getting them buoyant  turds moving,  getting them condoms 
[02:40:30]  dry and you're back  on shore.  Then you went home  and took a shower.  You know how much  money Jimmy could have  saved with that?  Hey, I had a buddy,  I had a buddy  who used to get boils,  okay?  And he would bust  a boil open  and soak it  in the Hudson River  down there  and it would dry it up.  You guys must have  got the best pot  in New York City.  You guys are insane.  Look at this guy.  There's a great thing  too at the end  of the same special  where I love the balls  he had too 
[02:41:00]  where he's talking  about how there's  no God.  Yeah.  But he ends it  like seriously.  He like says  there's no God,  never was  and this was like  a live HBO special.  Yeah.  What a great way  to end the special  like all kidding aside  go fuck yourself.  Absolutely,  he's telling the truth,  man.  Tell him how he sees it,  you know.  Yeah.  Because the way  we see the big electron  and me and George  used to goof about this  and laugh on it a lot.  He don't care  which team wins.  The big electron  doesn't care  about your mama. 
[02:41:30]  He doesn't care  about which political guy.  He does not care.  All the earth  is to him  is a show  with a bunch  of six billion  lunatics  running around  going ape shit.  He does not care.  He at times  when you'd watch  his take on things  and you'd hear  how  he had a great  gift of singularity  where he could  narrow something down  to its core  immediately  and just like  really really  deconstruct something  and you'd watch him 
[02:42:00]  do that  and sometimes  it's like watching  the only guy  who's awake  while everybody  else is sleeping.  That's the impression  you got  because he was  so to the point.  You're like  how did  first of all  as a comic  he always made you  feel like shit  because you're like  how did none  of us think of this?  Yeah.  Like how did  every fucking time  he would find  what the rest  of us missed?  Yeah.  And even stupid  things like  voting  how they say  hey you didn't  vote you can't  complain  and he said  that's exactly  why I can't  complain  because I  didn't contribute  to it  you did.  Either way  yes  oh yes  you're on the 
[02:42:30]  money man  you're into  his head.  What a great  what a great  angle to take  that I never  heard anybody  else take.  And I think  he took it  automatically.  Yeah.  It's just his  way of discernment  that when he  was a tiny  kid he was  you know  he would  look things  through.  Yeah.  It's a  it's a  beautiful gift  and he used  it and he  worked it  man.  And every  I'm so glad  he got that  Mark Twain  award before  he died.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know  not a posthumous  thing.  It was  awarded to  him as a  living dude. 
[02:43:00]  Patrick  it's been a  pleasure.  Listen  you guys  are great.  His death  came out of  nowhere.  When it  hit my  Blackberry  I'm like  what?  Yeah.  I didn't even  know he was  sick.  Any of that?  And we  had a good  relationship.  He was  starting to  do our  show a  little bit  more.  And we  were looking  forward to  more appearances  by George  on our  show.  Oh God.  Just an  obvious loss  to the  comedic world.  I thank you  so much for  that.  And let's  promote this.  You can go to  georgecarlin.com  or the CD.  It really was a  great special. 
[02:43:30]  It was the  last special he  shot in March  of this year.  It's bad for  you.  And once  again he  just takes  a common  thought and  he goes with  it where no  other comic  has gone.  He was just  so great  man.  I mean what  else can you  say about  George Carlin?  He was a  fucking genius.  I feel good  to know how  all you guys  appreciate him.  We all  looked up to  him in  different ways  obviously.  We all  looked up to  George.  I said he  was the  greatest comedian  I ever saw. 
[02:44:00]  He was the  greatest brother  anybody could  ever be.  How many  brothers did  you have  though?  I only had  him man and  that was  plenty.  That was all  I needed.  Hey Patrick we  want to play  something from  It's Bad for  You.  What do you  suggest?  Please play a  modern man.  A modern man?  Do we have  that in the  big system?  Hopefully.  Alright.  We'll try to  find it.  I'm waiting for  the thumbs up  there Patrick.  Okay because  you'll hear  music during  it.  It's got  such a thing  to it.  Okay. 
[02:44:30]  And we'd  like to have  you on the  show again.  You seem like  an interesting  fella yourself  there Patrick.  That interesting  is a beautiful  word like  Chinese use it.  Yes I'd love  to talk with  you guys again.  It's been  really wonderful.  Patrick do you  smoke the  herb or what?  Listen bro  George got me  into the herb  and I'm gonna  smoke till I  croak.  How old are  you?  I'm 76 and  I don't give a  good god damn  about nothing. 
[02:45:00]  Well thanks a  lot for calling  in man.  We don't have  that?  It's Bad for  You is the  new CD.  Patrick we're  just getting the  new CD in the  system.  We don't have  that one yet.  Is there  another one?  Oh any of the  others are good.  That's just like  my big fave.  Alright I'm  sorry we  wanted to  play your  favorite track  but we  don't have it.  That's okay I  loved them all  because I saw  that performance  man and he  knocked them  dead in Kingston.  Alright Patrick  Carlin everyone  georgecarlin.com  it's bad for  you.  CDs in stores  and on  amazon.com  right now.  And I'm so  glad you guys 
[02:45:30]  had fun with  them.  We had fun  with you too  Patrick.  Ah that's  good.  Go light up  alright we  gotta go.  Take care man.  You're like a  mind reader.  Patrick Carlin  everyone.  Bye bye.  This guy  rolled.  Jesus.  He never had  to work a day  in his life  having a brother  like George  Carlin.  Apparently not.  Boy George  lives on in  cyberspace too  huh?  Yeah.  And on the  web.  Everyone lives  on on the  web.  He sounds a 
[02:46:00]  lot like  George Carlin.  Yeah.  Creepy.  Alright we're  gonna play a  track from  It's Bad  for you.  I don't know  what E-Rock's  got queued up  but hopefully  wait wait  what are some  of the track  titles?  Yeah what  do we got?  This one's  called Address  Book.  It's about  people dying.  Oh okay cool.  Do we want to  do that one?  Why not?  Yeah oh yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah of course.  The more and  more the better.  Alright let's do  this one and  we'll continue.  So you know  what I've been  doing?  Going through  my address book  and crossing  out the dead  people.  You do that?  That's a lot of  fun isn't it?  Gives you a good  feeling.  Kind of gives you  a feeling of  power. 
[02:46:30]  The superiority  to have outlasted  another old  friend.  But you can't  do it too  soon you know.  You can't do  it too soon.  You can't come  running home from  the funeral and  get the book out  you know.  You can't do  that.  A little time  has to pass.  You have to  let a little  time go by.  I have a rule  of thumb.  Six weeks.  If you're a  friend of mine  and you're in  my book and  you die I  leave you alone  for an extra  six weeks.  Six extra  weeks in the  book on the  house it's on  me.  But after that 
[02:47:00]  hey facts are  facts fuck you  you're dead.  Out you  fucking go.  You gotta have  standards you  know.  Now these days  a lot of people  don't keep  analog address  books anymore.  They don't want  to be writing  that stuff out  longhand.  They're in the  computer age and  they have an  application in the  computer called  Outlook or  Contacts or  Address Book  something like  that.  So they keep  all the information  in the computer 
[02:47:30]  and they sync it  up with their  phone every day  or every other  day.  So now  instead of  scratching out  a name you  get to delete  the fuck.  And deleting  someone is an  even more  powerful feeling  than simply  scratching out  a name.  You know how  to delete  someone.  You select  the name,  highlight the  person and  then  straight into  the trash.  Now if it's  a really close  friend of yours  you might not 
[02:48:00]  want to empty  the trash for  about six  weeks.  Or if it's  a little too  harsh for you,  a little too  harsh to delete  an old friend,  you can always  create a new  folder.  A special folder  for dead people.  You keep it on  your desktop.  It's kind of a  digital purgatory.  And the nice 
[02:48:30]  thing is every  now and then  you can open  it up and  you can look  inside and  you can see  the people in  purgatory and  you can move  them all  around,  you know,  move them  around.  Put them in  little groups,  two people who  didn't get along  in life,  put them in a  corner,  let them work  it out.  Let them work  it out in  purgatory or  start a fight,  have a big  fight in  purgatory.  Nobody's going  to get hurt,  they're all  fucking dead  anyway.  Then you put  them in a  big formation  and have a  parade. 
[02:49:00]  The purgatory  parade of  dead people.  Ah,  there's a lot  of fun you  can have  with a  computer.  So enjoy  your digital  selves.  Now,  speaking of  dead people,  there are  things we  say when  someone dies,  most of us  say,  a lot of  us do,  things we  say that no  one ever  questions.  They just  kind of go  unexamined.  Give you a  couple examples.  After someone  dies,  the following  conversation is  bound to  take place  probably more 
[02:49:30]  than once.  Two guys  meet on the  street.  Hey,  did you  hear?  Phil Davis  died.  Phil Davis?  I just saw  him yesterday.  Yeah.  Didn't help.  He died  anyway.  apparently the  simple act  of your  seeing him  did not  slow his  cancer down.  In fact,  it may have  made it  more aggressive.  You know,  you could be  responsible for 
[02:50:00]  Phil's death.  How do you  live with  yourself?  Here's another  thing we say.  This is something  that is usually  said to the  surviving spouse.  Usually a  woman because of  the way it  works.  Listen, if  there's anything  I can do,  anything at  all, please  don't hesitate  to ask.  What are you  going to do,  a resurrection?  This ain't the  fucking New  Testament, you  know.  You know what  you tell a guy 
[02:50:30]  like that who  wants to help?  Oh, fine, why  don't you come  over next week  and you can  paint the  garage.  Bring your  plunger, the  upstairs toilet  overflowed and  a shuttle over  the floor up  there.  You drive a  tractor, good,  that'll come in  handy.  The North 40,  needs a lot  of attention.  Bring your  chainsaw and  your pickaxe,  we're going to  put your ass  to work.  He wants to  help, fuck  him, call  his bluff.  Call his  bluff.  The nerve of  these pricks.  Here's another  thing we say to 
[02:51:00]  the surviving  spouse.  I'm keeping  him in my  thoughts.  Where?  Where exactly  in your thoughts  does he fit?  In between my  ass hurts in  this chair and  let's fuck  the waitress?  What are  your priorities?  We use a lot  of euphemisms  when we talk  about death,  you know?  People say  things like, 
[02:51:30]  you know I  lost my  father.  Ah, he'll  turn up.  You've got to  stay optimistic  with people  like that.  Give a reason  to hope.  Have you  checked the  dumpster out  back?  He used to  like to take  a nap in  there.  Keep it  upbeat.  We got  someone not  happy.  Lisa,  Long Island,  what's up?  Maybe we  could talk  humor is in  the worst  taste I have  ever heard.  I can't  believe the  choice of  humor.  Do you  think that's  funny?  Yes.  That's  intelligent? 
[02:52:00]  Make a pie,  bud.  Make a pie.  It's the  O.B.  and Anthony  Show.  Hey guys,  this Saturday,  August 2nd,  Black Sabbath  will be signing  their brand new  box set called  Black Sabbath,  The Rules of  Hell.  It's the  lineup of  Ronnie James  Dio,  Vinnie and  Tony Iommi,  and of course  Lisa Butler.  And it's at  Vintage Vinyl,  51 Lafayette Street  in Forge,  New Jersey,  TheVinyl.com.  From 3 to 4 p.m.  only,  500 limited. 
[02:52:30]  So if you want  to go down and  buy the box set,  they'll give you  a wristband and  you can go back  and get it  signed.  But I'm going  to stop down  on my way  to the Traveling  Virus Show.  It's a perfect  location in Forge.  Just stop down  and head down  to our show  and get Black  Sabbath to sign  your box set. 
[02:53:00]  You're checking  out the O.B.  and Anthony  Show.  Great Giraldo  in studio and  Robert Kelly.  You wouldn't  know it because  they haven't  said anything  yet.  They decided  to just sit  back as we  interviewed George  Carlin's brother  there, Patrick.  I love that guy,  Patrick.  He's like a hippie  pothead living in the  woods dude that never  had to worry about  anything in his life.  Yeah, right on a creek.  That's a good place to be,  I'm thinking, huh?  Stoned on a creek.  No worries.  He's just talking about,  what do you do?  Well, I just live up here  in the middle of nowhere.  Oh, okay.  And, you know, 
[02:53:30]  George Carlin had all  the stress and the  heart problems and  there's Patrick, his  older brother.  Not a worry in the  world.  He's healthy.  Smoking his weed.  He's healthy as an  oxygen.  76, smoking pot every  day.  Ah, you gotta get that  stress out of your life.  I like that.  That's not obvious.  Jimmy was like the  James Lipton.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, Jimmy gets into  us.  Very informed.  Jimmy does a very  good interview.  I figured, you know,  for George, it's easy  to talk about Carlin.  I mean, if it was like,  if it was Jed Johansson's  brother, I would have 
[02:54:00]  been like, what was  that bit he did with  the couch and bums?  That's the start of  our new bit.  We want to get just  brothers of famous  people on the show  now.  No joke.  We really wanted to  see how many we could  actually get on the  show.  So we got some  connections.  Hey, it's a very sad  day.  I'll speak for myself,  for me, for Aunt  Jimmy, I don't know.  I mean, you guys can  speak up.  It certainly is.  It's the last day for  Eric Logan at XM  Satellite Radio.  Yeah, of course they  said it.  Elo!  Hey, guys, how are you  doing?  This is the day, huh,  sir? 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, this is it.  That's it?  They've taken stuff  out of my office.  They've taken my box  away.  Oh, boy.  Your box of stuff,  and you got to hand in  your little key cards  and everything.  Are you doing a,  what was the name of  the movie, About  Schmidt?  Oh, yeah.  Are you doing a little  About Schmidt, leaving  some stuff for the new  guys, and they're like  just nodding, going,  yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.  No problem.  And you'll find it out in  the dumpster later.  Right, exactly.  So I have nothing.  I mean, I would have  some very lovely intro  sound effects, but my 
[02:55:00]  mom's box has gone off  the table here.  Oh, boy.  You better know how to  do that the right way.  That has to be your  last words on the show.  I know.  Don't worry.  I want to make sure I  get in, because I'm not  quite sure when the  hang-up's coming.  Not today, my friend.  How do you feel  leaving?  I mean, obviously,  you're going to a  bigger gig, but is it  depressing on some level,  you said?  No question.  I mean, it's, you know  what it is, you know,  I've enjoyed being here  for the four years.  I can't believe it's  been four years, by the  way.  Yeah. 
[02:55:30]  And, you know, and  hearing Mel talk on the  show yesterday, and then,  you know, having seen him  two or three times, you  know, everybody in that  room knows how I feel  about that man and how  much I've loved working  for him back in  insanity and CBS.  And when I heard the  merger was going to  happen and he was going  to be the CEO, it was,  you know, I felt great,  because it's like,  here's a guy who gets  it, and the industry is  going to be wildly  successful because of what  he's going to do.  And the sad part for me is 
[02:56:00]  not being here working for  him, and this is going to  be a fun place.  I mean, you heard him  yesterday on the show,  and I thought that was  terrific, and, you know,  he tells a story better  than I could.  I mean, it's, you know,  it's almost as big as  Comcast, the second biggest  radio company.  I mean, it's...  We're bigger than U.S.  Steel.  We're going to pass  around Eric Logan's  sound machine.  Everybody poke a button  at the wrong time.  I just got an IM and  just said, hurry up,  my phone card is going 
[02:56:30]  to run out here.  So they've got me on  phone cards now.  What is Eric going to  do?  What is he going to do?  He's going to work for  Oprah Winfrey a little,  you know, yeah.  Yeah, he did very well  for himself, trust me.  I know you're not  familiar with Oprah  Winfrey, but you may  want to give him a shot.  She's the big black  chick, right?  Well, speaking of  Oprah Winfrey, Bill K  writes, hey, Opie,  oh, wait, no, no,  Stephen S., sorry.  Hey, Opie, please tell  Elo we look forward to  his return to Sirius XM  radio when he falls off  the wagon and Oprah  lets him go.  Oh, geez.  When he's arrested by  the Chicago Police  Department for... 
[02:57:00]  Just something awful.  That's a great gig,  man.  Look, I got to be honest,  when Elo first started  with XM, I didn't think  we were going to get  along.  We had a meeting,  a bunch of us in here.  Are you kidding?  No, the first day,  the first time I met  Elo, Eric, do you  remember, it wasn't  an argument, but it  was like a little  back and forth in the...  No, we were in the  bullpen, and I can't  remember the topic, but  you chased some funny  rabbit down some black  hole, and I don't mean  a prostitute, and you 
[02:57:30]  just made a point about...  Actually, what it was,  if I remember right, it  had something to do with  the fact that the  premium tier, and we were  having this philosophical  argument about why you  were there, and I was  toting the company line  knowing all along that  you guys were coming off,  and in fact, I had told  Opie and Anthony that  you guys were going to  be coming off, and that  was one of the things  that I was going to do,  but it was going to take  some time, and you  weren't...  You didn't get the memo  because you didn't know,  and I didn't know you,  and so you were just  browbeating me into the  ground.  Yeah, I was...  I'm sorry, I got... 
[02:58:00]  No, no, it's...  That's what it was, and  we were arguing about it,  and that's when I fell in  love with you because it's  like, you know, this guy's  got passion, and that's  why I love him.  Hey, you were telling a  story to me the other  night going, you remember  when you guys were on  the premium tier, and  you're like...  And you were trying to  spin it, like, it's  really good news, guys,  you got 20,000 people  that have signed up for  your show so far, and  I go, Elo, we used to  get 20,000 people at our  gigs, and you go, that's  when I knew I had to get  you guys the fuck off the  premium tier, or I was  going to lose you guys. 
[02:58:30]  I mean, it was like,  oh, this is going to be  great, and I remember  when Hugh sold into the  board, and everybody  said, ah, we'll do it  for this, that, and the  other, and I'm like,  I go, we've got to fix  this, and we've got to  fix it now, so it was  like, we'll get him off  the premium tier, and  we'll get rid of  Playboy, and I'm like,  oof, that was a strong  move.  Did you want us on the  premium tier, or was he  all for taking us off?  No, no, I mean...  Did you all push that?  It was...  You know what it was,  actually?  It was the company's  attempt to try to see  if they really could make  this like a cable  service and charge premium  for HBO and everything 
[02:59:00]  else, and the reality  is that it's just a  different world, radio  versus TV, and it  didn't work, and it  came off as soon as I  got here.  It came off like the  following March, if I  remember, right?  It was a bright day  when you joined the  company, because the  one thing Ant and I  remember, because we're  up to about four years  too, we pretty much  started with Elo.  We were here about a  month before he was,  and when Elo came  aboard, I'm like,  thank God they finally  hired a radio guy,  because that was  obvious to us.  There was no radio  guys.  Yeah, guys that knew  how a cell phone 
[02:59:30]  worked, and how  cable networks work.  Like, what about  radio?  This is a special  thing.  We need a radio guy.  I'm proud to say,  by the way, I never  escorted you down this  back stairwell after you  came to XM.  Yeah.  Remember that, when  they snuck you out of  the building?  We told the Hugh  Pinero story that he  walked into the room,  and he's like, I just  want to let you guys  know.  This was his opening  statement.  He goes, I want to let  you guys know, I'm not  a fan of your show. 
[03:00:00]  I'm like, wow, this is a  great way to start.  Yeah, nice.  And then he spun, he  goes, but I understand  why, you know, I need  your show on XM, but I  just was like, oh, man.  Well, Hugh got it,  though, I mean, because  then he hired Bob  Edwards.  I mean, that was a  cool move, too, because  he put the same weight  on both shows.  You know what I mean?  Like, both were going  to kind of do the same,  and NPR was the way  to, you know, both  were going to do the  same business.  Hey, Elo, how many 
[03:00:30]  hours you got left at  XM?  Let's see, what, five,  seven hours.  All right, so we're  probably five if you  take out my two-hour  lunch I'm going to  take today.  I need to know the  answer of one question.  Okay.  When the homeless  Charlie thing went  down, who wanted us  fired?  Nobody wanted you  fired.  Come on.  You're going to  swallow?  Yeah.  I don't believe Eric.  Who wanted you  fired?  I'm sorry.  I'm drinking my  hot tea with my  Oprah and Friends  mug right now. 
[03:01:00]  Channel 156, by the  way.  I heard things.  I'll get the real  answer when I go up  to Chicago.  We heard you saved  us.  Yeah, we did hear  you saved us.  Well, let's just put  it this way.  It was, there were  some incredibly  choppy waters, and  there were several  heads in the room  that were reacting  fairly wildly, and we  just needed to let  those heads simmer  down and let  somebody who has  seen the storm  before navigate 
[03:01:30]  those waters, get  to the other side,  and get to a  better place.  Who was the  blogger?  Who was the  one that got  that to Breitbart?  You can tell us  now.  It's 14 months  later.  That I don't know,  actually.  I don't know that.  Do you think it  was someone from  the NAB, your  suspicions?  I'm still fairly  convinced it was  somebody at the  NAB.  Such a stupid  thing, but we  survived it.  Thanks to you.  Mel said on air  and I believe off  air that  definitely both of  those are true,  I'm sorry, that he 
[03:02:00]  had a really good  position for you  with the new  company.  Yeah, that's  true.  I talked to him  yesterday, I've  talked to him two  days ago, and I'm  going to see him  here in about 20  minutes.  When does the  firing start?  After you leave  the building?  I don't know, but  there's a big truck  with a lot of axes  that just pulled up.  I don't know what  that is.  Oh.  You're going to a  two-hour lunch.  There's a lot of  clear plastic being  laid on the floor,  and a lot of people  are smart.  They're setting up  the room like  what's-his-name,  an American Psycho,  getting everything  ready for the  bloodshed. 
[03:02:30]  I don't know why  they're showing  Saw 3 in the  Hendrix room.  Yeah.  You know what,  Eric, when you go  to lunch, people  will be like,  all right, we'll  see you when you  get back.  Ah, no, you  won't.  You'll be gone.  Hey, I'm going to  read Bill Kay's  instant feedback from  Philly, something I  want to bring up,  but I'd rather it  come out this way.  Hey, Ope, how  fucking cool is  Elo for talking  you guys up to  Mel on one of his  last days in the  office.  He's so fucking  cool to you guys.  Yep.  And Mel said more  of that after the  show, by the way,  after his appearance,  just saying how you  were raving about us. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  And you didn't have  to do that.  Well, you know how  I feel about you guys,  and it's all three of  you.  You know, I think the  show's suffering today  because Bob's in the  studio, but I think  Oh, oh, oh, oh,  Bob.  Oh, Bob.  You know, I was actually  enjoying you.  I was really like,  wow, this guy's a  really nice guy.  Well, you didn't even  know he was going  to Oprah.  And I didn't know.  I just wanted to know  though, because I  cared.  I just wanted to know  where he was going,  and I was happy for  you that you're going  to a bigger and  better things.  But you know,  sometimes, you know,  it's all right, man.  That's okay.  All right, Bobby.  I take it back. 
[03:03:30]  I love the cadre of  people that you have  on the show.  But I have always  been and will continue  to be the, I believe,  the biggest fan of the  show.  And I've said this, I  know, to you and  Aunt and Jimmy off the  air, and I'll say it  on the air, that the  only thing that really  changes for my love of  this show is the fact  that I actually now  can be a full-fledged  participant in all the  pest and ONA army  because I had a hard  time doing it when I  was an officer of the  company. 
[03:04:00]  Now I can just call  them and really tell  them what I think.  How about, by the way,  Logan talked about this  the other night.  He's insane.  He was one of those  guys that would call  and give the, you  know, the hate calls.  Oh, yeah.  No, absolutely.  Remember that guy down  in Florida with the  billboard?  Remember that one thing  like three years ago?  Uh-huh.  Our fans bought, anyone  doesn't remember the  pests, bought a bill, but  Jim Phillips, his name  was something?  Phillips.  Yeah, Phillips File.  Phillips File.  Yeah.  And he had been  bad-mouthing us or  something, and the fans  ruined his life so 
[03:04:30]  badly, he was actually  just calling behind the  scenes saying it has to  stop.  I don't even know if you  know this.  I got through on the air,  and I totally just said,  listen, I support  everything you do.  I think it's completely  unreasonable, your mom's  box.  And he had no idea, and  then what was ironic was  the next morning, I got a  phone call from the  programmer of that radio  station.  I literally thought he  busted me.  And he was like, could you  do me a favor and have 
[03:05:00]  those fans of that  channel stop calling my  guy?  I'm like, what are you  talking about?  He goes, Jim Phillips,  the Phillips File, the  opening Anthony.  I said, who?  Oh, yeah.  You know, not really  familiar with what goes  on.  I have 190 channels I've  got to watch.  But I was on the  freaking air with this  guy.  That's unbelievable.  At least you weren't  like Anthony.  You didn't call Mancow  and help.  Yeah, I know.  My helpful call.  Fucking Anthony.  You should have called  Mike in Francesca and  said, you got the  pirate score wrong.  Just helping out. 
[03:05:30]  The first time I met  Elo, my first impression  is a little different  than Jimmy's.  Stupid Fareed flew me  out for a radio  conference to Arizona  and Eric Logan was  basically running  Citadel.  And I got to talk in  front of a room filled  with radio guys,  whatever.  But my first impression  of Elo, I've never  seen anyone drink as  much as Eric Logan  back then.  Well, I had seen  that too.  Yeah.  And you never fucking  slept.  Like, this conference 
[03:06:00]  was pretty important  for Fareed and the  gang.  And you're the guy  that they're supposed  to be listening to.  And I barely knew  this guy.  He's like, I don't  even know how I'm  going to talk in front  of the, it was like  five, six hundred  people.  I'm so hungover.  I haven't slept yet.  I just can't wait to  go back to my suite  and have another  after hours party.  I'm like, wow, this  guy, I got to get to  know this guy.  Well, that was when  the stock was at  20.  So at 83 cents, I  don't think we're  doing a whole lot.  Yeah.  Do you think we're  off those stations? 
[03:06:30]  I had a suspicion  because it was really  irritating.  We were doing well  in Buffalo.  A part of me  thinks that they  know this merger  was going through  and they're choosing  the summer to do  it because they  know that Mel's  probably going to  be very difficult  for them to  continue with.  Well, I think  that, first of all,  I think Terrestrial  Radio is just  completely lost.  They don't know  what they don't  know.  You heard Mel  say yesterday,  and I agree with  them.  I mean, this is a  no, there's no  growth in that  business.  And the only way  they grow cash flow  is by removing 
[03:07:00]  an expense.  And so, if  they're paying  you guys $55,000,  which, by the  way, is criminal,  okay, and they  can go, well, we  can pay somebody  $45,000 and  shut up and  rock, then, you  know, that's in  their mind  justified.  It's the stupidest  thing I've ever  heard.  I mean, it  just, if there's  one thing that  Mel will not do,  and I agree, and  you guys know  this, is you don't  get cheap on  talent.  Let's hope Mel  remembers that  because some of  us have to  renegotiate. 
[03:07:30]  And Mel may  not know.  61 days, right?  Well, I would  hope that Elo  would mention  somebody to Mel  because, you  know, tell him  the Charlie Rose  question guy.  He'll remember  me.  I did.  I mean, I  was listening to  that interview,  and all of a  sudden, that  Charlie Rose  question come  up, and I  mean, I  cringed.  It was an  audio cringe,  and then I  thought Mel's  line was great  about asking,  is your real  name the same  as the contract?  Yeah.  Well, I was  kidding when I  asked that.  I was joking.  Oh, you do.  Thank God.  I know, but  listen, Jimmy, I'm 
[03:08:00]  so if he brings  it up to me,  I'll text you  like you're dead.  He won't bring  it up.  What's the  schedule down  there today?  Well, the  schedule is that  Mel's down here  and some of the  folks from  Sirius XM New  York, as they  call it, are  down in the  building, and  they're seeing a  few people, most  of my directs,  you know, John  and Sandy and  Tony and those  folks, and, you  know, I usually  get to the office  at 6, you  know, between  6 and 6.15.  I've never seen  more people in  the office at 6 a.m.  in my life.  They know a lot 
[03:08:30]  of them, it's  going to be the  last day they  see the comp  plan, they're  probably walking  around.  The only thing  you're going to  see is the  inside of a  body bag.  You think people  are getting  fired today and  tomorrow?  No, I don't  think so.  No.  No, I don't  think so.  Hey, if you just  happen to come  upon Don  Wicklund's firing,  could you, you  know, make sure  you call us real  fast with your  cell phone so we  can listen in?  I will.  I will.  I'll have a  pocket dial you.  Do you think  Wiki's in trouble?  I hope they don't  fire him.  We should put  him on Pal Talk.  We should put  Pal Talk  cameras everywhere  and just have  the firing there.  And of course  Anthony was  telling the  Derek Logan 
[03:09:00]  drinking Bob's  minibar after  the Letterman  show.  Anthony, by the  way, I am  writing a book,  by the way.  I am going to  write a book and  I don't care about  anything.  That is a whole  chapter that night.  That was hysterical,  man.  Bob was cringing  every time one of  us got up.  We were like,  hey, what do you  want, an Amstel,  some vodka?  And Bob's  just, you could  see cha-ching,  cha-ching in his  head as he knows  we're just...  But Anthony,  that's not even  the best part.  That's the capper  to how I pulled 
[03:09:30]  that check maneuver  at dinner.  Oh, yeah.  We were trying  to figure out  how much was  the wine?  The wine was  $300 a bottle  and we ordered  four bottles of  it.  Yeah, it was  well over $1,000  for the wine  alone.  And Bob started  gulping and  getting panic  attacks and Eric  goes, don't worry,  we'll split the  bill.  We'll split the  bill.  So that made  Bob feel a little  better.  And then by  the end of  this whole  dinner,  Elo just  lent the  check over  to Bob.  Well, you didn't  say what the  split would be.  It was $95,500.  No, it was $100,000. 
[03:10:00]  Exactly.  Actually, to this  day, Bob is  trying to get  half from  Elo.  Oh, no.  I mean, still,  every so often,  Bree, you know,  in the office out  there, this lovely  lady, sends me  this random  invoice and  it's like, he's  now moving to  try to mask it  under a variety  of things like  stamps or  something.  But it's still  like, I know  what the bill  was.  And the invoice  comes in, I  literally throw it  in the trash.  That's so funny.  He'll probably try  to send it to  Mel.  I'm sure that 
[03:10:30]  will work.  I hope you guys  understand how  well you got him  because I know  a little bit about  Bob, too, and he  won't let his  wife go into the  minibar when they  travel.  She has to go and  get all the snacks  you would get in  the minibar and  bring it with her.  So when you guys  pull that move,  that really hit  home with him.  Oh, it was  fantastic.  I mean, there was  nothing left.  I mean, Anthony,  there was nothing  left.  We ravaged it, and  I know he was  upset, because 
[03:11:00]  every time we  got up, his eyes  would look over  and be like, oh  no, what are they  getting now?  All right, some  nine, ten dollar  beers.  I think what it  was, but people  got to remember,  when the Letterman  taping happens,  what's it, like  three o'clock,  four o'clock?  Yeah, something  like five, five  thirty or something.  So five, first  of all, we were  drinking in the  green room.  Right.  Then we went to  dinner and drank  like fishes out of  water.  And then Opie was  the responsible one  and went to bed.  And Anthony and  I said, ah, let's  go. 
[03:11:30]  And so we went to  the lobby of the  Parker, drank there,  and I think we  watched a ball game  or something, I  think.  And then we went to  Bob's room so we  could watch the  rebroadcast of the  Letterman show, which  was eleven thirty.  Yeah.  And then get up to  do the morning show  the next day.  Yeah.  By the way, that was  the pinnacle right  there with us and  you, Eric Logan.  When you showed up  in our dressing room  at Letterman before  we went on, that was  like, that was the  moment.  That's the one I'll  remember.  You remember what  I told you guys  too?  I told you this is  one of the happiest  days of my career 
[03:12:00]  was seeing you guys  here.  Yeah, I got a  picture.  I'm actually blowing  it up.  I'm going to send it  to you.  No, I'd love to  have it.  Maybe displayed in  your new office.  I'll have it in my  office, I promise.  When you guys come,  you can see it.  So does Oprah like  us?  Let's cut to the  chase here.  Yeah, she does.  She asked about you  actually.  I talked to her  yesterday.  Oh yeah, okay, sure.  My book's coming out  in November.  She actually asked  about Bob.  Who's a Hispanic comic  who did the book?  Whoa, I'm Irish.  Hey, Eric, my book  comes out in November.  What are the odds  of Oprah kind of 
[03:12:30]  featuring it, helping  somebody out?  Go.  You know, pretty bad.  Pretty bad.  Why not?  I think she may  enjoy the honesty of  it.  What do you think I  got to do to get  on her desk?  Go.  I think what you  need to do is write  a children's book.  It is.  I'm sure it is.  What's it called?  Never snitch.  You know, what really  pisses me off about  this whole thing, this  business is really  weird.  You say goodbye  to people all the  time.  But I told Logan  the other day, we  were talking, I'm  like, what sucks 
[03:13:00]  about this is I  always knew that you  would leave eventually  or we would have to  leave or whatever, but  we'd work again.  Like, I just assumed  he'd run CBS radio or  some other, like, you  know, radio thing.  That could help us.  Yeah, and then we  would, like, you know,  team up again.  But he picked a job  where there's no chance  we're going to work  together anytime soon.  And that's what pisses  me off.  Happy for you, though,  sir.  Well, I appreciate it.  It's going to be great.  I mean, I'm going to go  get in television.  I'm going to be in  charge, you know, I'm 
[03:13:30]  going to get in the  print world.  And it's just, you  know, it's a great  thing.  I can't complain.  We finally find a guy  who likes working with  us and he runs off to  be a district manager  at Corvettes.  Yeah, I told Mel  yesterday we finally  decided to listen to  somebody in our careers  and that was Eric  Logan, you know, just  to get serious for a  second here.  And the way we were  talking about you,  Mel was like, did you  guys not like Eric  Logan?  Like, he didn't know  that we...  Oh, yeah, because we  were just goofing on  you a little bit.  And he was like, oh,  you don't like him?  I was like, no, no,  we love the guy.  That's our way, you  dummy.  No, it was, I was, I 
[03:14:00]  was, that was the  first time I've ever  heard Mel say something  about me like that.  And it was, that was  very touching, actually.  I was like, I was, you  know, I don't know  when's the last time  you heard Mel say  anything about that  by anybody, actually.  Yeah, Mel was a  different Mel yesterday.  It was nice.  And you know, and  it's funny you say  that.  He's still the same  Mel as he's always  been, but I've just  noticed, I mean, he's  just, he's very happy  right now.  You know, he's just  in a great space.  He's happy, he loves  what he does.  I mean, it's, it's,  I really, I'll tell  you, after spending the  last two or three  days in contact with 
[03:14:30]  him, you know, I'm  missing this place  already more than I  thought I was going  to two weeks ago.  Yeah.  And that's why I,  that's why I know  this place is going  to be in a wonderful,  wonderful space, you  know, in the future.  It was really weird  because I was, I  was saying like, I,  that was more time  I've, I mean, maybe  with you, but I  never spent that  much time with a  boss since I've  been doing this.  I mean, especially  a guy who's, you  know, been on that  level of, uh, of the  game.  It was, it was great.  You know what I  mean, think about it.  I mean, this is a  guy who, I mean, he  is a media mogul.  This guy is enormously,  you know, and he 
[03:15:00]  wanted to spend more  and he had to get  back to the town  hall meeting that he  had.  So Eric, I'm such a  dick too.  After, after his  appearance, we'd go to  commercials.  I go, Mel, I just  want to let you know  something.  He goes, yeah, you  did an hour and 15  with Howard, 45 with  us.  I'm keeping track.  And he goes, and  then he went into  defense mode.  I'm like, dude, I'm  just kidding.  I'm fucking with  you.  Yeah.  Sometimes he jumps  right on defense mode.  It's like, no, no,  I'm just fucking with  you.  I would like Mel.  Cause then he's 
[03:15:30]  like, I would have  done more time, but I  have a town hall  meeting over at  Sears and I can come  back.  I'll give you another  half hour.  I'm like, dude, I'm  just, I'm just  fucking around.  Well, it was, uh, it  was a great interview.  I thought you guys  handled it well and  you guys, you guys  are going to be great  and you know, you're  going to go to a  much, much bigger  platform and I think  it's going to be  fantastic.  I'm just waiting for  the day that you and  Howard are all in  the same studio  together.  You know, I look,  it's not that crazy.  I mean, look,  everybody wants this.  This is different than  regular radio.  This is not like,  well, if this one  doesn't work,  there's always that  one.  This is a rare case 
[03:16:00]  where the company is  one company.  It's like, it's one  medium.  It's almost like if  satellite doesn't  work, XM series  doesn't work,  Sirius XM doesn't  work, it's fucking  satellite doesn't  work.  So it's like a  different motivation  to work with  everybody because it  has to work.  Regular radio, you  don't have to get  along on KROQ to  survive.  You don't.  But you better, the  company better do well  to survive in this  because if Sirius XM  falls apart, we're all  fucked.  They can't.  They can't, yeah.  Speaking of what  Elo just said, I  talked to Robin 
[03:16:30]  Quivers for like 15  minutes yesterday.  Oh, you see her a  lot, man.  She lives in our  neighborhood now.  She told me where  she lives.  She's our neighbor.  The new Jim  Florentine?  No, also, I'm just  sitting on a park  bench on Broadway.  Jimmy, you know  where you can sit?  Hi, Opie.  And all of a sudden  I look up and it's  Robin.  I'm like, uh, hi.  So we were trading  notes about our  Mel interviews  yesterday and it  turns out she, I  don't want to blow up 
[03:17:00]  her spot, but she  lives very close to  us, Jimmy.  Well, her and Jim  broke up.  Extremely close.  That's good.  Yeah, I read that in  the paper.  I see Fred's car  every morning.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they broke  up.  Yeah.  I see Fred's car  every morning.  He lives in my  building.  It's weird.  But yeah, so it's  not that crazy of a  thing, Elo.  I mean, it's like  the only person, I  haven't met Robin, I  don't know Howard, but  I mean, the rest of the  people I know, those  guys have met everyone  who they need to meet.  You're going to be a  silent listener because  I can't imagine you  would be able to, like,  call us if you're 
[03:17:30]  working for Oprah.  Yeah, I will assume  an alternate identity  and I will figure out  a way to get one of  those boxes that  changes my voice.  That would be...  Or talk, or slash  my larynx and get one  of those little things  that I stick in there  and sound like a guy  who's been smoking  for 20 years.  Just talk, not just  muffle it, like,  girl, just make your  voice like that.  Exactly.  Look at that person.  Ted Levine.  I promise all of my  friends on IM and the  emails that I'm going  getting from all the  pests that my presence  will be felt, I promise. 
[03:18:00]  All right, well, I  think it's time.  Yeah.  Thanks for everything,  Elo.  Hey, guys, I'm going  to miss you, and I  sincerely mean it.  I love you guys, and  I've got one final  thing.  Not yet.  We weren't finished  being nice.  I stepped on it.  You're the worst.  Jimmy, I'm trying to  do it.  Jimmy, listen to me.  You've got the timing  of throat cancer.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  Okay.  All right.  It's all yours there,  Elo.  The music's playing.  Elo, any final words 
[03:18:30]  for our listeners?  Before this, I have one  final thing for all of my  friends in the pests.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box. 
[03:19:00]  Your mom's box.  All right, fuck.  You're a fucking moron.  E-hoo.  Beat it.  E-hoo.  Fucking interview was going  nowhere.  E-blow.  Such a baby.  I actually got a little  moisture there in the  left fucking orb.  Did you?  A little bit.  Have fun at your new  job.  God damn right.  All right.  This is how we deal 
[03:19:30]  with real emotions.  That's how we deal  with traitors.  Hit the brick, shit dick.  It's been real.  It's been nice, but it  hasn't been real nice.  Get the fuck out.  Hang yourself with your  suspenders.  Thanks for nothing.  Four years of shit.  Wow, that blows.  It does stink.  There he goes.  That's it.  Guys, it's such  fucking disconnected  assholes.  Wow, we love ours.  We really do.  I know.  So what do you think  about the, what does  Jeff Goldblum think  about the new gig? 
[03:20:00]  Goddamn rich cunt.  Hey.  Like you rich cunt.  I'm Jeff Goldblum.  He fucking says it all.  He certainly does.  Who doesn't want to  scream that in somebody's  face?  Who doesn't want to  punch someone and yell  goddamn rich cunt?  Does anybody remember  laughter?  Yeah.  Remember laughter.  We got some lady on the  phone.  It says, this bitch  won't stop calling.  It's very annoyed.  You haven't spoken to her  yet.  Let's get to her.  We don't like to make  people away.  We apologize.  Who's this?  What's your name, dear? 
[03:20:30]  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  How are you, dear?  Hi.  Who are you?  Maria.  Hi, Maria.  What's going on?  Hi, Maria.  What can we do for you  today?  I heard you've been  calling for the last  hour or so.  Actually, it's been  two hours.  Oh, my goodness.  What's the matter?  What can we do to help  you?  All right.  Only one of the  time, please.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I have three things to  say.  Okay.  Okay.  Number one.  Jimmy.  Yeah.  You're sexually confused.  Why, Maria?  All you ever talk about 
[03:21:00]  is dicks and ass.  What's confusing  about that?  He's got a point.  Point taken.  Yeah.  Maybe that's all  you ever want.  No, that's not true,  Maria, because I don't  know how to say this  respectfully, but I do  talk about big tits  and big fat.  Hold on.  That's true.  I didn't finish, dear.  That's true.  I do talk about big  fat, meaty cunts.  Yeah, my pal Jimmy's  a slit man.  Yeah. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, okay.  So now he wants  dick, ass, and fat  women.  Sounds like a  I don't want fat  women.  No, no, no.  I didn't say it.  Don't.  You're putting fucking  you're putting words  in my mouth.  Well, now you also  said you had other  things to address.  Let's hear that, too.  What's next?  Tell him to shut  up for a second.  Oh.  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Jimmy, shut up.  Hold on.  Now, does this fat  pig have a problem  with me?  Yeah, do you have  a problem with  Jimmy?  Let's get this in  the open here. 
[03:22:00]  That's why I want  to know if the  other ones concern  you, too.  Jimmy, we love  you.  I have to tape  everything that's  ever on air that  you're on.  All right.  Oh.  Does the fact that  you have a drinking  problem make that  difficult?  God, I wish I did.  Okay.  Then I would be  happy.  What's number two?  What's number two?  What's number two?  Oh, boy.  Okay, number two is  you guys were doing  the thing about Obama  and McCain this  morning?  Yeah.  Well, there's a thing  on, if you go under  secretpants.net,  that they took 30 
[03:22:30]  quotes from all the  Batman shows from  the 60s, and 30  quotes from President  Bush.  This is old already.  And ask people who  said this quote.  Right.  Batman or Bush, we  know.  I like the way she  explains that.  She does it slow.  Number three.  Deliberate, yes.  You doze it off, you  can nap.  Number three.  Number three.  Is for my husband,  Arthur, to get my  X-7 in your car. 
[03:23:00]  What's the matter  with your X-7 in your  car?  Don't you hate  Arthur's wife?  You fucking  go.  He drives  truck, he's in a  shitload.  Bitterman.  No.  Run over my wife,  Bitterman, please.  This moose must have  really pissed you  off.  All right.  She's such a  fucking pig.  I'd rather fuck  Liza Minnelli.  Hopefully you'll wind  up like Dudley  too.  Look at all  Arthur.  Club footed and  pudding headed. 
[03:23:30]  A hat full of  mashed potatoes.  A fucking top  hat full of  fucking mashed  potatoes.  Jimmy, you like  those too, huh?  Yes.  I'm gay and I  don't like potatoes.  It's mine and I  don't have mine yet.  Show me how you  suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm  asked you.  Nice, right?  Slowly.  Do you ever  suck a guy's cock?  She's answering.  Tell him slowly.  Do you put mustard  on it and pretend  it's a big hot dog?  Show me with your  mouth.  That's what I'm  saying.  Show me with your  mouth.  He's. 
[03:24:00]  What?  He is obsessed  with cocks and  asses.  Shut your  goddamn piehole.  Ooh.  Can't she talk?  I did not  mention his  friend, did I?  Whore.  Whore.  Did she say the  third one?  I don't remember  if she said the  third one.  Oh, come on.  Come lighten up.  What's the third  one?  Yeah, she needs  her XM unit fixed,  Bobby.  What's the matter?  She's stuck over  two hours for this.  Let me tell you  something.  You are, perhaps,  the most boring  fucking caller we've 
[03:24:30]  ever had.  Do you understand  what?  Yeah, and it's not  just me saying that.  Everybody on  PalTalk Instant  Feedback, everything  else, is just  bashing you as a  waste of time,  boring cunt.  Jesus.  Who just fucking,  what, I'm just  reading.  I'm paraphrasing.  Jesus, Anthony.  But that's what the  people are saying.  The people have  spoken.  I find her endearing.  The people have  spoken.  I don't.  And why?  What?  Why am I boring?  Because you're  boring, everybody.  You're not, what you're  saying isn't interesting. 
[03:25:00]  The tone you're saying,  the cadence you're  speaking in, everything  about you, the way you  talk, is fucking  boring.  You're fucking  boring.  When you talk, I see a  little cartoon bubble  above it, and there's a  bunch of Z's in it.  Z.  Z.  Z.  And it's not even in a  talk bubble, it's a  little cloudy think  bubble.  Yeah, that's what I  meant.  Really?  You're boring.  Do you bore Arthur,  your husband?  We're gonna have to go  home early because of  you, because now you  need to sleep.  When was the last  time Arthur gave you a  little stickin' of some 
[03:25:30]  dickin'?  That's right.  Comment?  When the duty comes  out.  Come on, please.  I think she's good  at parties, though,  like her other  friends.  She probably holds  court when her  girlfriends come over.  Oh, I bet.  But she's just the  talk of the town.  Why don't you answer  the questions that  wouldn't be as boring?  When was the last  time your husband  Arthur gave you some  dick?  Where the duty comes  out.  Oh, last night.  Last night?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  How long have you  been married?  13 years.  Oh, yeah.  How many kids you  got?  Two? 
[03:26:00]  One.  One.  Why don't you  like me?  One that's  handicapped.  What's wrong?  Here's the problem.  Can we guess?  No, no, guys.  Guys, stop.  Seriously.  No, it's very  serious.  Can we play 20  afflictions?  Yeah, can we  guess what kind of  Can we try to guess?  What's wrong?  Sure, go for it.  We'll do 20  questions.  All right, let's  guess.  Yes or no  questions.  Okay?  Yes.  Is it mental?  What do you mean  by mental? 
[03:26:30]  It's a yes or no  question.  Is it a mental  handicap?  Okay, yes.  Does your kid  look like a lot  of other kids?  No.  No.  What was your  favorite beverage  during pregnancy?  Iced tea.  Okay.  Iced tea.  Okay.  All right.  Does it affect  your kid's ability?  No, it was not  Long Island.  Okay.  Hold on.  We got a question.  Does it affect  his ability to  play ping pong? 
[03:27:00]  Good question.  Yes.  Okay.  Yes.  How old is the  kid?  I'm actually  fun and I  really thought I  hate you.  How old is the  kid?  She's 11.  Oh, she.  Okay, so she's  11.  I got a question.  Okay, ask the  question.  No, go ahead.  Is your daughter  still wearing the  same pair of  shoes for the  last 11 years?  No.  No.  But for the  first 12 months,  yes.  Do you sometimes  wish you had 
[03:27:30]  fallen down the  stairs?  No.  Okay.  Bob, you had a  question?  Yeah, I was just  with this.  Does your daughter  eat like a horse?  And he means  grass in the  front yard.  What?  What about  the front yard?  For her birthday  party, do you put  a candle in a pile  of lead paint  chips?  No, but that's a  really good idea.  All right, so it's  mental, mental  handicap, IQ of 
[03:28:00]  70 or below.  No, say what?  Actually, we don't  know.  Okay, so.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  You want the prize  now?  No, no, no.  No, we're guessing.  When you guys are  taking family photos,  is she all the way  at the end so you  can crop her out?  No, but that's  sad.  That is sad.  That is sad.  Let me ask you  a question.  Let me just ask  a question.  Does she have a  really long tongue? 
[03:28:30]  No.  Okay, what do you  want to say,  Marie?  Give us a hint.  Okay, here's a  hint.  It's the opposite  of up syndrome.  Does it rhyme  with schnortism?  Okay, I got one  for you.  All right.  Okay.  Technically, she's  undiagnosed.  Oh.  We have a question  from a listener.  Is her spine shaped 
[03:29:00]  like the Superman  logo?  No, I wish it was.  I know what she's  got.  I know what she's  got.  Daughter of  retard-itis.  Jimmy, that runs  in your family.  Oh.  Jimmy, no.  She got me good.  Someone quick,  pop out their cock.  Rubber, you're glue.  First the potatoes,  dig, then this.  Oh, no.  I know.  Damn.  All right.  What stupid thing 
[03:29:30]  is wrong with your  daughter?  What is it?  Hold on, hold on.  That's stupid.  No, what is it?  More questions.  No, we really want  to know the answer  now.  What's wrong with  your daughter?  On visual inspection,  just looking, can  you tell that  there's a mental  handicap?  No.  No?  No.  Does it look like  she's wearing a  broom for hair?  Why would she be?  I wish.  Does her bangs just  go straight across 
[03:30:00]  the front?  Oh, wait.  No, I wish.  Undiagnosed.  What is that?  Then she's fine.  All right, what's  wrong with her?  Like, what could  you tell us?  Okay, well, first  off, my daughter's  11.  She's getting  four times  to locks of love.  Do you know  what that is?  Yes.  Hair.  What?  That's where they  cut the hair off  and send it to  little cancer kids.  Which is 47 inches.  My daughter's 54  inches tall.  I'm saying that  she's very, uh,  that's very sweet.  But what does  she have?  Cerebral palsy  is a dump all. 
[03:30:30]  What?  For what they  don't know what  a kid has.  Oh, so they  just say CP.  You got it.  That's bad.  That's bad.  Yeah.  That's not funny.  Yeah, flush Jimmy  with it.  That's not funny.  That's not funny.  How did you see  that jerk?  What were you  saying about me?  You threw me  into the mix again.  Yeah.  Oh, no. 
[03:31:00]  What's the matter?  You don't like me.  No, I'm trying  not to laugh  really, really  effing hard right  now.  Really?  How come you don't  like me?  Oh, yeah.  How come you don't  like me?  Jimmy, I have not  liked you since I  saw you on  everything on TV  and heard you.  Why?  But she's obsessed  with you.  Yeah, you know a lot.  Why don't you like me?  Let's be honest.  This broad has called  before, by the way.  Yeah, I know.  Are you fat?  And then there's no  shame in it.  When have I called  before?  What's that?  It doesn't matter if you  have or not.  It's irrelevant.  Are you fat or no? 
[03:31:30]  Because I beg on fat  women and they take  me wrong sometimes.  God, I wish I was.  You keep saying that.  5'9", 150 pounds.  So what's the problem  with me?  Why don't you like me?  5'9", 150.  That's a lot.  You're a big girl.  You're a big girl.  Yeah, I am.  Jesus Christ.  I can pull my  basketball.  Thank you very much.  Kenya?  What?  Your kid's head?  God, I wish.  I wish I had that.  You keep saying that.  Stop saying God, I wish.  That's a crutch.  She's an excellent  improper.  Yes.  Always go with it. 
[03:32:00]  Wonderful.  Keep saying the same  thing.  Look up that website,  secretpants.com.  No, we saw that  website.  It sucks almost as  badly as your call.  So why don't you quit  beating around the  fucking, beating around  the Moe Howard haircut.  Did you guys ever  notice that when he  gets offensive, he  gets belligerent?  Why don't you tell  me, they're both the  same thing, you dumb  twat.  Why don't you tell me  what it is you don't  like about me and stop  fucking boring everyone.  I gotta go.  Wow.  That was the sonogram  picture reaction. 
[03:32:30]  I'm sorry, it's true.  What is true?  When you get pissed off,  you get belligerent.  Yeah, so what?  That's not a ton on point.  You really have to go,  Bobby?  Yeah, I got a dentist.  I really, I was supposed  to go around 10 minutes  ago.  They got a clean  cum out of your teeth?  See another dick reference.  Yeah, see?  Yes, Bob's going to the  dentist to have  their strength.  Anthony, dear.  Yeah?  I really want to stay  for what's about to happen.  If you could please call my  husband to get my XM for my  last day.  Hold on, not until you 
[03:33:00]  explain why you don't like  me.  You have to explain why you  don't like me.  Because Bob is going to  have little hairs put on  his teeth to make it  easier to eat in the ocean.  I'd rather keep Anthony  in suspense.  No, it's not going to  happen.  I'm asking you.  No one cares.  I can't be kept in  suspense.  I'm the only one who has  interest in you right now.  I have to get my teeth  fixed, Jimmy, because I'll  mush my food on my palate.  Okay, give me a suspense.  As soon as this show  ends, Anthony's not even  going to remember you  called.  Yes.  Yeah.  You're very forgettable.  Oh, that's cool, because  that's fine with me, because 
[03:33:30]  guess what?  So are you.  Then why do you keep  calling, you silly pig?  Stop calling.  I wasn't calling to talk  to you.  Yes, you were.  There was nothing you'd  love more than for me to  park my fucking caddy and  me to let you take my  dick down to the root.  Who are we kidding?  That's exactly what you  want.  I'm not a man.  No, you sound like a  man.  You're a fucking woman, and  you need to be fucking  fucked properly.  Your husband's on the  road, probably blowing  guys through glory holes.  Jesus, Jimmy.  That's what Arthur's  doing. 
[03:34:00]  Just don't come in that  busted baby maker of  hers.  I don't know what'll  come out.  That fucking womb.  It's like the house  from Lost.  He gets so belligerent  when he gets...  You said that already.  I agree with you 100%.  Maria, you just  languish in redundancy.  Say something different.  Jimmy.  Yes?  Quit talking about  dicks and asses.  You said that already.  Yes.  Keep it going.  You're doing  wonderfully. 
[03:34:30]  I love this girl's  improv.  You say the same thing  over and over.  You make no real  points.  Don't do your  husband hates your guts.  Jim, so do you.  Your husband hates you.  Your husband hates you.  What's the point?  You're calling me.  I don't care about you.  I didn't call you.  Yes, you did.  I called Opie and Anthony.  I'm right here, baby.  He's part of the show.  Exactly.  It's Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy.  We just don't have enough  room on the cardboard.  I didn't say I'm  calling Jimmy Norton  personally.  Doesn't matter.  The phone screener  hated you.  He said this pig  keeps calling.  You're a fucking  attention whore.  You need to connect 
[03:35:00]  somehow.  You need that connection.  I don't like being  put on ignore for over and over.  Why?  You're ignorable.  You're a non-entity.  You're on ignore  your whole life  with people.  I think you're a  Munchausen syndrome  by proxy woman.  What do you mean by that?  I think that she keeps  her daughter ill  to get attention.  Oh, yeah.  She's probably right.  One of those kind.  You fucking six-cent  suit maker.  You six-cent  suit maker, right.  You put a little Drano  in the kid's soup.  What are you doing  over there?  What are you doing?  Shooting feces  into her arm  to keep her sick? 
[03:35:30]  Actually, I don't think  that's not funny.  She's probably totally  You know why?  Because probably  it's close to home.  She's probably  totally fine.  No, because I just  took her doctor yesterday.  Because you seem like  an attention whore.  And attention whores  have this Munchausen  syndrome by proxy.  Have the doctors  discussed that with you?  My problem is  Undiagnosed?  That's fucking weird.  Yep.  And boy,  maybe somebody  better look into  what you're doing.  What does your doctor  say?  How often do you  see the doctor?  A lot, I bet, right?  You help out  with the diagnosis 
[03:36:00]  and everything.  You know the nurses  by name when you come in.  Yeah, your friends  are like,  how's it going?  Yeah, yeah.  You're like,  well, you know,  it's a struggle every day.  Let me get some more  fucking Windex  for her Hawaiian punch.  Then you just  got to call  and get on the radio  and they keep  hanging up on you  and you just  got to fucking,  you just got to  keep calling.  You got to fucking  be heard,  don't you?  Everyone is pointing out,  by the way,  Joe from Jersey,  what kind of mother  calls up and plays, 
[03:36:30]  guess what's wrong  with my retard kid?  That's true.  Oh, are you a horrible mother?  Yeah, how much  attention do you need?  Right from that  infected womb  up until 11 years later.  She actually decided  to play,  guess what's wrong  with my retarded kid?  You just sell your kid  down the river  for 30 seconds  to try to connect with me  because you're fucking,  you got something for me.  We both know it.  You try insulting me  because you're a little girl  in the schoolyard,  but we both know  what you'd like.  You'd like me to kind of  pull your hair  and face fuck you. 
[03:37:00]  Is that the kid  in the background?  Was she calling  about the thing  earlier?  What thing?  Was she conceived  during a keg stand?  Secretpan.net.  Stop with this  corny website.  You would like me  to lay you on the bed.  You want me to lower  your head off the bed  so the blood rushes  to your head  and then throat fuck you  with my onion balls  on your nose  until your eyes tear up.  That's what you want.  You want to make  that noise.  Which means now,  besides being  into guys,  he is  unbazed. 
[03:37:30]  On what?  Because if he says  he has onion balls,  he's out,  Jimmy.  That was kind of  the joke.  I was saying  that I have such  little regard for you  as a living entity  that I wouldn't  even shower.  I'd put my onion balls  on your fucking  desperate nose.  I'd say,  look,  I'll acknowledge you  and you'd go,  uh-huh,  and you'd say,  okay,  because you sold  your own kid  down the river.  You fucking called  repeatedly.  How did I  sell my kid  down the river?  Exactly.  The same fucking  plain guess  what's wrong  with my kid.  You're fucking,  you're awful.  You're awful.  You're an attention whore. 
[03:38:00]  You are an attention whore.  You gotta admit.  Question.  How did I sell my kid?  I explained that to you.  I stopped talking  and listen.  It was just  explained to you.  I just explained  to you what you did.  You asked.  Shut up.  Go ahead and ask questions.  Exactly.  Instead of just going,  no,  I don't want to talk  about that,  you had to be  fucking radio prize whore  and try to get  the hosts  interested in you.  Because we told you  you were boring.  You're boring.  And you don't like  hearing that.  That's fine.  You're a boring person.  You really fit  the fucking profile  of one of those.  Your husband ignores you.  Yeah. 
[03:38:30]  Cool.  What do I win?  Nothing.  You're a retarded kid.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  The kid's a victim  in this.  Please.  Be nice.  Who even knows  if she has a kid?  I don't even know  if she has one.  Can your daughter  communicate?  Is she verbal?  No.  Oh, no?  Really?  Wow.  Unfortunately,  mom didn't have that.  Yeah, and you were drunk.  She's what?  You're drunk.  Yeah, were you drinking?  Of course you were.  Don't lie.  God, I wish.  During pregnancy?  Wait, her kid doesn't talk? 
[03:39:00]  No.  Non-communicated.  Do you speak?  You could hear  her kind of slapping  in the background  a little bit.  Who even knows?  I don't even know  if she has a kid.  No, actually, we speak.  Oh.  See, making fun of your kid.  That's not nice.  That's good.  At least you know  you or your kid,  so it's a little easier,  but you shouldn't be  making fun of your own  own kid.  It's not her fault  that you decided  to drink during pregnancy.  Mommy, I'm hungry.  Hold on.  I'll feed you in a minute.  Mommy has to go  get some attention  for herself. 
[03:39:30]  Mommy has to go  stay in the front yard  and do something  to draw attention  to herself  or call a radio show.  Yeah, Jimmy has to talk  about dicks and ass  because he can't  get a wuss.  I can't get a wuss?  It's called a pussy,  sweetheart.  It's called a cunt.  Yeah, it's called  a fucking pussy,  not a wuss.  I didn't want to be...  It's called a baby maker.  You said dick and ass.  Oh, yeah, in your case,  why don't you say  Jimmy just can't get  a disaster area.  Exactly.  Holy shit.  Where do you live?  What city do you live in? 
[03:40:00]  Is it your womb  lined with lead?  Hey, fallout shelter pussy.  What city do you live in?  Actually, that would be  really, really funny  if you think about it.  Yeah, I know it would be.  That's what we said.  Why don't you say  what city you live in?  City?  Philly.  Ah, Philly.  All right.  What's going on?  So it's within range  that I could meet you.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Would you like to meet Jimmy?  Why don't you come up  and meet us? 
[03:40:30]  Why don't you meet Jimmy  and maybe slip you  a little dick?  What's that?  Slip you some cock?  I won't let you suck it,  but how about this?  He doesn't have one.  Shh.  How about this?  I won't let you suck it,  but I'll let you look at it.  Like, I'll wave it  in front of your face a little.  Would you jerk off  on her face?  Absolutely.  Okay.  How about Jimmy jerks  off into your face?  But no touching.  I'm seeing someone.  Oh, God.  And do I have to get  a magnifying glass?  Oh, Jimmy.  No, she didn't.  You're saying,  she's saying, 
[03:41:00]  Jimmy's got a tiny cock.  That's not true.  This is a giant cock.  That's the last girl  that was with Jimmy.  What?  What's that?  Do I have to go to Atlanta  to the disease place?  Disease place.  To get my pads  that it wouldn't affect me?  Well, it already affected me.  Wow.  Really?  Sorry.  This woman,  maybe this woman  and her daughter  can go on a double date  with you and Josh Blue.  Dick balls,  dick and ass,  balls and dick. 
[03:41:30]  Wouldn't that be great?  Wouldn't you love that?  A guy.  Dick and balls.  She's trying to breathe  out of her nose,  but Jimmy's balls  are right up  against her nostrils.  And they sweat  and I have cranky ass  so I was nervous  about our big date  and normally I'd clean that  but for her I don't.  So I kind of rub  my fucking sweaty ass  on her nose  and I say breathe.  Breathe it in.  I'd trap your head  between my thighs.  What's that, sweetie?  What's that, Whitney?  Nothing.  Exactly.  Yeah.  You're a lonely woman, 
[03:42:00]  aren't you?  Where's dad?  Actually,  he just called  a second ago.  What did he say?  Get off the phone,  you embarrassing hole?  What did he say?  No, I didn't answer.  I was talking to you guys.  That's good.  Yeah, he's basically saying  when you get off  the fucking phone,  you're embarrassing me.  You're an embarrassment.  That's why he was calling.  You know that, right?  Cool.  Hey.  Cool, hey.  Yeah, cool.  Only once in a lifetime.  Yeah, once in a lifetime.  Do you know how many times  you get drunk  and embarrass your husband?  Don't you understand that? 
[03:42:30]  You're an attention whore  and you're embarrassing  everyone in your life.  Just behave with dignity.  Comment?  Oh, God,  like he is the  person we should all mock.  Shh.  I'm not calling radio shows  begging for attention.  This is my job.  You're home.  Exactly.  Ew.  Now, you can continue  to fake laugh  or you can really acknowledge  what's going on  which is that  you're an embarrassment.  You're an attention whore  and an embarrassment. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  Thank God.  And you're a joke.  Ah.  Oh, Jimmy.  That's why he makes...  Oh, sorry.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  That's why he makes the money.  Because I'm a joke.  Yeah.  Why I make the money...  Okay, fine.  He's a jokester.  You got me.  But the bottom line is this.  I'm a joke.  I make the money.  What you are goes beyond that.  Shh.  I didn't call to argue.  I just called to give you,  you know...  No one's arguing.  A little that.  You gave us nothing.  It's a shitty website.  I didn't call to get insulted. 
[03:43:30]  Yes, you did.  You called for attention.  Any attention you can get,  you'll take.  I didn't...  No.  I'm sorry.  You started insulting me.  We went on the phone for over an hour.  You started insulting me.  You're a pest.  Nobody wants to talk to you.  And you continue to call the radio show.  And then you get on and you insult me.  Then they could have said,  they don't want to talk to you.  You tell us,  you tell us purposefully,  either your kid is disabled  or you make it up  just to stay on the phone longer.  And then you play a game. 
[03:44:00]  Guess what's wrong with my kid?  I did not.  You're a disgrace.  That is a little insensitive, isn't it?  You're a disgrace.  I mean, we come up with these things.  Sometimes we don't expect people  to actually go for it.  And it is kind of disgraceful  that you did kind of use  your handicapped daughter  in a radio bit.  If she even has a daughter,  because then she goes,  oh, she can't communicate.  Therefore, we can't say,  put her on the phone  or make her say hello.  Okay, hold on a second.  I don't want to talk to her.  Come here, Cass.  Look at her.  She calls her kid over.  You guys asked me.  And you call your kid over. 
[03:44:30]  What's her little name?  Her name's Cassandra.  Aw, Cass.  Take care, boo-boo.  Way to give her a name  she'll never spell.  Hey, stop.  Come on.  Jesus, she talks to her kid  like a fucking puppy.  I know.  I don't know.  No, because right now  Jimmy has me kissed  because my daughter  is my most precious thing.  Then stop using her  as a radio prop  if she really exists.  Did you just say  my daughter's  my most depressing thing?  My most precious.  Oh, precious.  Cliché nonsense.  Oh, wow.  I hear, I hear. 
[03:45:00]  Hold on.  What are you,  tickling the kid?  That's the kid cringing  at her mother's  embarrassing attempts  at attention.  You know what  the translation was?  Mom, get off the phone.  You're making  an idiot of yourself.  Mom, you're an ass.  Were you tickling  little Cassandra?  No, I just put her  up in my lap.  Oh.  11.  Cassie's not that little.  She's 80 pounds.  Why are we...  At 11, 80 pounds?  Is that normal?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's all right.  That's small?  That's all right. 
[03:45:30]  Is it?  I like my 11-year-olds  with a little meat on them.  Look, you're depressing  the shit out of everybody.  I gotta step out  of character here.  This is a downer now.  We feel bad for the kid  and we don't like you.  I'll speak for myself.  I feel bad for the kid  that instead of just...  Why?  Because you're bringing  your kid on the radio.  What are you doing?  I'm sure she...  Yeah, she's not  the problem.  Yeah, you are.  Don't you get it?  All right. 
[03:46:00]  Could you...  Could you, like,  leave now, please?  Why don't you just go away?  You guys are great.  Jimmy, kiss mine.  Oh, good one.  Go out with a bang.  She wants it.  She did, Jimmy.  She wants you so bad.  Is that...  She's called before.  No, she does.  Something I've said  in tree turn.  She wants your cock.  Well, she knows I shave it  and she knows it looks good  and it's a good thickness  and she probably just  wants it in her face.  Yeah.  She wants to smell it.  She wants to breathe it in.  Everything.  She wants to clear stuff  on her face.  Yep.  Why am I saying that?  She does.  I don't know.  What is wrong with us? 
[03:46:30]  I don't know.  So she had a slight...  You like you.  She had a slight problem  with the show.  We just fucking destroyed it.  Yeah, but it was her...  It was something about her.  She was so annoying.  She's exploitive  and she's a...  Boy, if there is ever  a profile or candidate  for that Munchausen...  Yeah, that was dead on.  Munchausen syndrome.  She just fucking attention whore.  She probably knows  all the nurses and doctors  and questions them  and helps out.  What do you need me to do?  I do.  No, no, I give her  the injections every day. 
[03:47:00]  We know it.  Before you know it,  they find out the kid's fine.  Mother's been pumping  fucking toilet water into her.  That's what happens.  She's fucked up.  She's called before.  I recognize the cadence  of her voice.  Yeah, she was annoying.  All right, listen.  We got to do line of the day  and get the fuck out of here.  Greg Giraldo,  thanks for stopping by.  My vote is...  He he he he he he he he he.  Oh, my God.  That was depressing.  What?  Steve sent me something  real quick.  I don't know if you want  to check it out.  What? 
[03:47:30]  Yes.  He sent me an email  a few minutes ago.  Bush and Batman.  Go to this website.  It's fabulous.  There's a foundry logo.  So you can't tell  by looking at them  which one it is.  Well, he he he forwarded  me a picture of a porno  picture that he felt  looked like opium.  I guess it was just  real important that he  had to share it with me.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Let's let's take a look.  Holy shit.  That's hysterical.  The fucking hair's too dark.  It's of Steve's opinion  that this looks like opium.  That really does, actually. 
[03:48:00]  But he meant the cock.  Look how big it is.  The cock's too small.  That really fucking  does look like a younger  opium.  Stop.  What have you done?  It looks like you.  You fucking get the  cocky look.  The big hog.  The girls look at the  camera like what?  That looks like the  chick that just called.  Exactly.  I was just thinking that.  It looks like Kathy Bates  is blowing you.  Fucking opium's doing  a live remote from  the set of misery.  And the fucking  chick gave him a hummer.  And how does Steve  find that?  Of course he does.  Porn stars that look  like opium.  Big coxie googles 
[03:48:30]  and whoever pops up.  Hello, Steve.  Where did you find this?  Where did you find this gem?  It got sent to me  by some listener  so I forwarded it to Danny.  It wasn't like I was  trolling the internet  looking for porno.  Oh, I thought you were  trolling looking for  large coxed gentlemen.  Yeah, what do you  Google porno  dudes that look like opium?  Yes.  Sorry we've been teasing you.  We do line of the day now.  Yes.  It's time for line of the day.

Back in time  because he's Superman.  John McCain eats puppies.  Greg Giraldo,  a little runner-up  line of the day, huh?  Oh. 
[03:49:30]  GregGiraldo.com  and he's going to be  at the show on Saturday,  PNC Bank Arts Center.  A few tickets  still available, Jimmy.  Very funny, Greg Giraldo.  Great comic.  Oh, thanks, Jim.  Jim, true.  Jim, that was really  nice of you to say.  Well, you know what I mean.  I appreciate it.  All right.  You're aces in my book, too.  Well, that's what we do.  We just kind of stroke  each other a little.  Two pals.  That's my pal.  Big man.  Biggest man in town.  The deluxe short dinner  for my friend.  Here's another  runner-up line of the day.  You're just assuming  it's all going to be okay, 
[03:50:00]  but you don't know  if there's giant beasts  right under the sand.  And the first words  from the moon,  oh my God,  it's got my foot.  Buzz Aldrin tomorrow?  We have Buzz Aldrin  very early.  Pendulant after.  Payne and Taylor.  And Black Sabbath  at 10 o'clock.  Mike DiStefano  will be here as well.  Oh, wow.  DiStefano's in  at like 8.30  and Luther Campbell  is in maybe.  Oh, God.  It's a big...  Maybe.  No, whatever.  It's a big busy day, guys. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah.  Get a lot of sleep tonight.  You'd be tired tomorrow.  I want to thank  Patrick Carlin  for calling me.  Oh, yeah.  He was very cool  to talk to.  He was a lot of fun.  And, of course,  the great Elo  who we will miss.  That was kind of sad,  wasn't it?  Very sad,  but it's not sad  because he's not  getting shit canned.  It's like, you know,  he moved on  the way you should move on  to a bigger gig.  Yeah.  Here's another  runner-up line of the day. 
[03:51:00]  So I lay  and I am one with nature  and one time  I woke up  and a gecko  was eating aphids  off my testicles.  Ted.  That's right.  Ted is such an ass.  Ted cares about the planet.  You don't.  Yes, I, apparently.  Ted doesn't want  to leave a carbon flipper  into all.  Irresponsible, Ted.  That's right.  Ted was very funny today.  Yes, Ted doesn't  use water bottles.  I'm thinking, though,  how could Ted  be that environmentally sound  when he makes filaments  for light bulbs? 
[03:51:30]  Well, he only makes a few.  They're different people.  Oh, I thought  it was the same.  You haven't figured out  there's a whole army  of Ted yet?  I thought it was  the same person  because it sounds  exactly the same.  No, they have different  cadences and stuff.  And they make the same face.  They've been cloned.  And they're all named Ted.  And they all have  the same inane fucking thoughts.  It's obvious.  Ted was cloned  and they don't have  that cloning  completely figured out.  So each Ted  is slightly different.  A bunch of guys  that do different stuff.  That's all it is.  What's wrong with you, Anne?  So Ted, the light bulb guy.  Filament maker. 
[03:52:00]  We all know Ted.  Filament maker.  Is different from Ted.  Not much different.  He's a clone of Ted  the environmentalist.  Ted the environmentalist  can kiss my balls.  Oh.  Who's that?  I'm Ted the filament maker.  Oh.  But he sounds just like him.  I sound nothing like that queer.  He drinks acorn juice.  I buy tomato cans  and throw them in the street.  I see trees  and I just go  boo. 
[03:52:30]  That was great.  When Jimmy's doing Ted  it's sorry to tear down a wall  but he has to look up  even though the microphone  runs well.  He has.  He really plays the character.  Because his eyes are all shut.  His eyes are shut.  He looks up  but he does his Ted.  Yeah.  That's the way Ted talks.  I understand.  There's many Ted's.  Here's another runner-up  line of the day.  I got sick.  I went whale watching  and that has to be the worst.  In a mirror?  Look at both of you.  I've never seen Jimmy.  Jimmy looked like  he just got shot. 
[03:53:00]  His eyes  his eyes  went so wide open.  That's right.  I'm Ted the whale watcher.  Thanks for stopping in, Robert.  See the fucking work  the dentist is doing  on those teeth.  Yeah.  Much work as they get.  They probably just wore down.  He's fucking putting  fence posts in.  Every six months  fucking stupid  has to go in  and have just  extra teeth added.  Way to kill it. 
[03:53:30]  I had it  and I got greedy.  Yeah, you got a little greedy  but that's funny.  Congrats guys.  We made it to 11 today.  Yep.  Here's your line of the day.  Here  comes  the line of the day  the line of the day  the line of the day  the line of the day  the line of the day  we weren't finished being nice.  I stepped on it.  You're the worst.  Oh, he's still here though. 
[03:54:00]  Jimmy, literally  You've got the timing of throat cancer.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Okay.  People want you to incorporate some Ted into your stand-up there, Jimmy.  It's hard to do because Ted just appears.  I have no control over Ted.  He just shows up.  But I do occasionally, I'll do a Ted voice in my act, but I would like to do more.  I don't know why, on stage, I almost feel like I would love to talk about it. 
[03:54:30]  I never talk about radio show stuff on stage because I never want the crowd to think that  I'm relying on it and not doing it.  I don't know.  I should just throw a little in there.  I know.  It's fun.  You're such a purist.  No, it's not that even.  No, it's because you're an artist.  I just don't want them to think that you're fucking, I don't want them to think that I'm  not working on stand-up.  It's too weird.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  He sounded like the real person until he got throat cancer.  Oh, wow.  Jim C.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's go. 
[03:55:00]  I'm breaking your balls, and no matter what, you're getting fucking fish.  Fucking fish.  Best line of movie history.  What the?  Best of my party.  Great Geraldo.  Thanks.  Yes.  See you Saturday.  Yeah, man.  Listen, it's been great.  Thanks.  I was a little, I'm a little sick today, so I didn't talk.  What's wrong, sweetie?  I have just a touch of AIDS.  Oh, that's right.  I've had that.  Yeah.  Yeah, sneeze it right out.  Sweat it right out.  Some brandy.  A UTI.  But I'm looking forward to Saturday.  Yeah, get some rest.  Saturday's a big day for you. 
[03:55:30]  Big day for Greg Geraldo.  Squeeze your cock over a Ritz cracker.  That's how I get rid of my UTIs.  That does it?  Yeah, I grab the balls and I ring them.  Just ring it right out.  I ring my dick and balls like an old rag.  What kind of cracker?  Ritz?  Yeah, of a Ritz cracker.  Would that saltine work?  No, because Andy Griffith wants to eat it.  Crisp Ritz cracker.  Sweaty balls.  What?  God.  The Opie and Anthony Show School of Super Professional Broadcasting presents Phone Calls 101. 
[03:56:00]  Talking to a female listener.  Can I talk to you for a second?  You can go.  Okay, just try to keep a little quiet and listen to what I'm saying.  I'm just letting you know.  You can't shut up, can you?  No.  Listen, Karen.  Karen, shut the fuck up.  Karen, hold on.  Don't talk.  Don't talk.  Right.  Listen.  No, when someone says listen, you don't go, I'm listening.  You just listen.  Shut up for a second.  You're not, you don't shut up for a second. 
[03:56:30]  Why don't you shut up?  Shut up.  Shut the fuck up.  Shut the fuck up.  Would you shut the fuck up?  Holy shit.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut the fuck up.  Shut up. </pre>
