<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a contentious discussion about the White Stripes’ refusal to allow their music in a military recruitment ad, escalating into vulgar commentary about the war.  This transitioned into a surreal phone call from Max Cook, doing a rambling, Ambien-influenced Tony Soprano impression as the deceased James Gandolfini.  Cook’s call dominated a substantial portion, covering his “death,” family, and opinions on various celebrities.

Following Cook's call, David Lee Roth appeared as an in-studio guest.  The conversation ranged across Roth's career with Van Halen, his time as an EMT, his childhood, family life, travels (including anecdotes about Tokyo and McDonald's worldwide), and experiences in the music industry. He shared a story about his father being targeted and how it influenced his life, recounted tales about Earth, Wind & Fire, and jumping off truck bumpers.

A brief mention of an upcoming interview with Tina Fey and Jeff Richmond, along with standard plugs for various segments, podcasts, and sponsors (including legal, financial, and personal care products), followed.  The show then revisited James Lipton’s earlier appearance, focusing on a story—subsequently reported in other news outlets—from his memoir, "Inside," about his time as a *maquereau* (facilitator of encounters between clients and sex workers) in 1950s Paris.  Lipton detailed the social context, the lack of stigma surrounding sex work in France at the time, and anecdotes involving famous clientele. He also revealed his recovery from alcoholism, recounted an awkward encounter with Julia Roberts where he alluded to this past, discussed his acting teacher Stella Adler (and her students, including Marlon Brando), and contrasted acting styles.  This segment included audio clips of Jim Norton acting drunk, followed by more advertisements (SiriusXM, Get a Room.com, tax services, life insurance, etc.).  The segment concluded with an interview with Trace Adkins, who promoted his *Celebrity Apprentice* participation, discussed his past as an oil rig worker, being shot in the heart by an ex-wife, his conservative political views, firearm ownership (comparing his experiences to *Armageddon*), his rivalry with Penn Jillette, and his charity work.  Humorous speculation about a movie based on Lipton's "Grocery Man" superhero concept followed.

Further discussion with Trace Adkins included promoting his new album ("Love Will..."), more *Celebrity Apprentice* anecdotes, a humorous story about getting arrested in Canada for possessing a firearm, and a segment on gun laws.  A pre-recorded interview with Courtney Love was played, covering her life in the music industry, stories about Kurt Cobain, a legal dispute over Cobain's belongings, and potential TV appearances. This section also included numerous advertisements, a segment with Robert Kelly promoting his podcast (“You Know What Dude”), and mentions of Mark Cuban and Bill Burr. The overall tone remained irreverent and vulgar.

The show continued with Kurt Metzger discussing his dispute with the Upright Citizens Brigade (UCB) over unpaid performances, detailing his complaints, disrespectful treatment by staff, and a fellow comedian's show being removed from the lineup. He recounted a planned “debate” at The Stand comedy club that didn’t involve UCB.  The discussion broadened to the historical struggle for fair pay among NYC comedians, comparing pay at established clubs like The Comedy Cellar to newer venues, and the general treatment of comedians by club owners. Metzger's outspoken Facebook posts were referenced.  The segment included explicit references to bodily functions and sexual acts, along with vulgar language.  Bobby Kelly extensively participated, sharing his own experiences. The segment concluded with sponsorships and lighthearted banter, including Valentine's Day gifts and a comedic anecdote about Metzger's past relationship.

[00:07:30]  this is normally i like a couple fingers up my eyes what the what happened relive six months of ona in  just one short week hoping anthony's worst of 2013 so far  welcome to day five of the worst of 2013 so far with me sam roberts opie and anthony are ending  their week-long vacation back on monday with live programming however before that we'll finish off 
[00:08:00]  uh this great week of highlighting the best moments that have happened this year so far  actually this just happened we met a guy well we found him on youtube and he ended up calling the show  named max cook who does a spot-on tony soprano impression well james gandolfini died it was a  very sad day for everybody but especially for the guy who does all the tony soprano impressions on youtube  he decided he lives in california so he calls in at like 6 30 a.m east coast time which is 3 30 in the 
[00:08:30]  morning his time and he's all fucked up on ambien he calls in his tony soprano and it's just making sense  and nothing very weird phone call from tony soprano beyond the grave on the worst of 2013 so far  open anthony's worst of 2013  so far hi who's this i'll fucking die oh no  it's not what i fucking wanted i'm 51 fucking years old what are you 
[00:09:00]  fucking kidding me i still had fucking work to do down here  fucking shattered and i'm glad i died in rome it's kind of poetic if you look at it  jeez wow wow what happened let me tell you something i'm a gluttonous son of a  bitch but more than that there might be other elements things i can't talk about 
[00:09:30]  i'll tell you one of the first thoughts i had when i heard he was dead  is fuck i should have come back that day and met him i wish i i because he was here one day at three  and i had always i was doing something legitimate for work but i remember going like i want to go  back and meet him but i think i couldn't and i was like fuck i was so mad right and uh like i  god i wish i would have come back and met him so you automatically think of my little being  affected by it right it's such an unimportant i'm glad i never met you i gotta be honest 
[00:10:00]  everybody thinks i'm a four-loving guy i'm not leave me the alone i'm miserable  that's another thing that again i think he probably would have said exactly like that  look i appreciate it very much but can you back the away you're invaded my personal space  i'm in no mood  what what are we gonna do without gandolfini  it's panic 
[00:10:30]  i think a lot of people will be seeing your youtube videos in the coming days because now  they're going to be searching out all sorts of gandolfini stuff yeah you know oh it's only 51.  i don't know i don't know doesn't make any fucking sense huh i just had a little girl  now what i never wanted to be one of those deadbeat dads that's not around to take care of the kids 
[00:11:00]  i gotta tell you something this really fucking hurts  i was having a good time even though it was a bit of a crank what did brad pitt say is he all right  no he's really upset about your passing there oh yeah yeah he's got a lot to be upset about  look at him with his zombie movies his long blonde hair this this adonis he's a good guy though i gotta  say i enjoy playing off of him did a couple of movies they gotta give me it sounds just like 
[00:11:30]  oh man man is right what what do you have to say about all the all the people they're really really  really sad i don't know i feel really bad for him then again i'm sort of floating around in these vapors  here and i don't know what's going on yet i mean i can't tell you there's life after death  because i don't know yet give a man a minute  it's not like you're bored in a cosmic train 
[00:12:00]  he's like an ambient well did you did you see the light people talk about the light people talk  about the light don't they i saw a.j i saw meadow i saw carmella i saw him young and then as i started  to ascend further up into the sky they started to get older and then i saw babies i didn't recognize  them it's very weird and then it's it's like that night at holston's when everything went black 
[00:12:30]  and she got a baby i don't want to be dead  i want to watch my little girl grow up  this sucks jesus not to mention all the food i'm gonna miss  the food and the beverages and the lifestyle i got very comfortable i got a lot of respect but i was

[00:23:00]  till 11 yeah and you know and the duke of mcdougall is now the duke of swimming class at leisure world  but with that sense of humor and that drive he was a complete downtown guy yeah yeah years five  zero and you grew up around all that how cool is that the rest of my family was doctors and lawyers  and indian chiefs my pop was a prison doctor for the last 25 years of this thing wow you know ivy league 
[00:23:30]  he called it uh uh fulsome and san quentin and was there anything that happened like a crossroads  in your life where you might have ended up as a doctor or lawyer instead of a a rock and roller well  we were combat hippies you know back in the when when uh life magazine first declared you know the the  flower children or whatever in the mid 60s i remember that like it was yesterday like boom we all had 
[00:24:00]  crew cuts we were all in the junior rotc doing flag uh whatever where you march with the fake rifles  and go to put up the flag yeah the first time i was handed a rifle i was eight years old and you  know i loved i'd still go shooting at the same time when we were done we'd go sneak some marlboro cigarettes  that we had uh uh shoplifted from the ralph's market right around the corner and listen to uh  somebody's older brother's jimmy hendrix records and it was kind of in the same day you know we're 
[00:24:30]  talking about sixth and seventh grade you know and you know just be just as i was becoming a teenager  you know so you never had the ambition to want to uh go into a professional field like a doctor or  anything like that no it was always i knew i wanted to be showbiz from the time i was really  like seven years old right i wanted to broadcast i wanted to talk on the radio you know have you  seen like one of those guys the little i know about you that you would actually maybe go out 
[00:25:00]  and check out the town you're in i know my bicycles with me i still do okay you set up you set up a  mountain bike but instead of like when you're hunched all forward like you know like you're like a  monkey on a football sometimes it looks like when you're all just right forward it's an uncomfortable  position if you're not actually in the mountains and we're never in the mountains so you set it up  with those beach cruiser handlebars so you can sit up straight and tall you know and look around  like a gentleman and see the world around you go at half speed you know and then just chill out it's 
[00:25:30]  kind of a low rider approach it's going to be hilarious though it'd be like i think i just saw  david lee roth what ride by on a bicycle oh yeah and people would be like you're full of  shit yeah you're high you can trade that you know easily easily i've taken my bicycles all over all  over the world now you can get a bicycle for 200 bucks you know so you can you can actually go to europe  and buy one there but you should be able to pack them up and take them with us virtually everywhere  you know and that's that's what you do that after tours like you do a big van halen tour for like two  years and then go like live in a hut in africa for like three months with no phone that's in the 80s 
[00:26:00]  there's no phones there's no communication the band's trying to track them down and they're like  we don't know where he is he's in some hut i'll be back wow that bicycle i've been living in tokyo  since the end of the last tour here which was like what the last day beginning of last summer i'm sure you  don't stand out much there same bicycle it's the same uh the same get around i get around you know  you just decided to live in tokyo yeah let's uh take a shot at that we've been looking at it through  the back window of the car for so many years touring let's actually take a walk around from 
[00:26:30]  the inside out get to know the folks and do you like it it's uh it's one of the most interesting  travel experiences i've probably been in over 250 cities in the united states alone yeah and on my  bicycle and most of them and this is our 35th anniversary holy is it yeah it's if there's  anything holy about us it is that wow 35 years yeah what do you like about tokyo it is an island  you know that's that's the polite way of saying it wow everybody else is from outside is you know 
[00:27:00]  it's a foreigner outside whatever and uh man the the number of uh white boy faces that i would see  in a common day on my bicycle you can count on one hand really the whole day and i ride my bicycle  everywhere i go to language school almost every day so you must be very um like if people see you  they must know you're david lee roth from ben halen oh yeah i use my smile like a ray gun  all the way across no siding you're always oh yeah and i i know how to really just slow the room down 
[00:27:30]  easy because as soon as i walk in people are you can see the shoulders come up and i know how to say  or you know right away nihongo gaere desu mi-ma-san i mean excuse my bad japanese and if you're cool  look and a nihongo gaere kuso sumi-ma-san you know like this excuse my shitty japanese and you know  right away they're laughing okay he just made me he's all right yeah he's okay the food you can 
[00:28:00]  pretty much stevie wonder it you know and i gotta keep to my crocodile it's like crocodiles each just  birds and foliage it's pretty much just uh chicken and turkey and whatever these days yeah yeah whatever  greens come with but uh do you eat sushi i do there's a place in japan the subway that famous  guy that have you eaten at that place zero there's probably 25 places that serve every bit as good as  that do you guys like sushi you like japanese love it it's really simple and it's not based on how big 
[00:28:30]  is the slice is just how fresh it really is like and that's why the guys are yelling when you come  walking in everybody goes it's supposed to make it seem like really immediate  it's like when you hear a siren and you look and you see rollers in the in the rearview mirror it's  like no right now no really if you've ever wondered it makes perfect sense when they're hammering and  you know like this yeah also another thing when you when you come into a sushi bar old school style 
[00:29:00]  and there's a couple of them around here where you'll see old ladders one on each side of like  you know behind the bar where they have the big mirror and they'll have a couple of old ladders  and they're wrapped with ropes and stuff like this and it looks like ornamentation look for it you'll  see it you know what those are for no idea that's old school when you get a drunken samurai who's just  out of his brain on sake which is stronger than white wine and he's swinging around that that uh that 
[00:29:30]  blade how do you actually stop him without touching him they get two little guys with ladders  two guys like jimmy could actually just pin him to the little pin him to the wall until he gets a  little tired and you run up and put the sword out of it no idea that is brilliant did not know that but  now i'm going to look for those ladders that's when you know you're in a good place  i guess that is old school what's the best place to get sushi in new york that i wouldn't know i've 
[00:30:00]  been out i don't know i came here to find out from you guys what's going on after the first tour you  know you knew exactly where okay here's the best place for donuts here's the best place for thunder  funk here's the best place for ribs and here's the best place for uh disco and here's the best place  and you could just go through the whole list yeah but back then the connections to places were  probably more real like now it's all just this thing and the stratosphere you can pull down but  back then there was probably a much more of a real connection to each place because you could only 
[00:30:30]  get this here or you could only get that there so each place meant more for a different reason  now you do travel it's the same shit everywhere it's the same thing yeah you look at a window you  see the applebee's and the fridays the starbucks and the starbucks and a home depot like i don't know if i'm  in seattle or we're a block away from time square it amazes me all these people spend all this money  to come to new york to hang out with everyone coming to new york and they go to the fridays  and the applebee's and not even seeing new york they hang out in time square like i don't think 
[00:31:00]  dave goes to mcdonald's in tokyo i probably he probably has because each mcdonald's is a little  different right i'm gonna check it out each this is part of the fun of travel this is a good point  is that each mcdonald's is a little bit different according to the location what do you get in  tokyo in tokyo you get uh it's a little bit of a it's like a bit of a soy taste it's called umami  and it's uh just a little it's not fish it's more like mushroom kind of a flavor really it's in most 
[00:31:30]  japanese food okay it's in all it's in the miso soup that you order you know and a lot of the food  like in your teriyaki sauce and stuff you just don't know it it's in there and until somebody  takes it out then you go wow there's a little bland today or whatever and they put that in  the burgers they put that in the burgers in paris france you know we all know from uh  tarantino royale the burger royale whatever but there's more sugar in the uh whatchamacallit in  the ketchup it's noticeably sweeter and if you go down south into the alabamas in this area like this 
[00:32:00]  then the coca-cola has twice as much sugar easily really so yeah and then there's other  places like a lot of salt you know france and belgium they like tons of salt all over their french fries  you know other places not so much do you guys see at least you like you're a very like unstructured  guy you like to do what you want to do free spirit jimmy free spirit when you want to be structured  if it's something you like like because you went to you become an ems here in new york like if you focus 
[00:32:30]  on something you have no problem being structured and doing it but it seems like you probably don't  like being told that you have to do something maybe that's why you never got married you don't  like to being told what to do that's a part of it that's a big part of it is you know i can't see  you telling your wife look i'm going to the freaking africa live in a hut for a month i'll see  you later no you can't you know people will say ah there's names out there like that there are not  it no and as far as anybody who even got my job and kept it this long is uh nobody functional ever 
[00:33:00]  did that okay nobody well adjusted never stayed this long in my job in show business so that being  said um i think what was the original question just it seems like you'll focus on something like  here because no one likes being told what to do but then you are able to go and become an ems or like  you said go to japan because you want to learn to do this and that's that's there's something to  be said for that the ems thing is strange how many years did you do that oh let me think and how  many times did you get recognized as you're trying to sell somebody out people are hallucinating 
[00:33:30]  he's gonna give me mouth to mouth some chicks like i want i've been wanting to kiss him since  all i needed was a closed head wound  you were all in with the ems thing you were out there doing it huh yeah for how long i started  when i was about 46 47 and i finished up about a total of about six and a half years really yeah  i restarted three times and uh i did my internship up in the bronx with the 47th precinct big shout out 
[00:34:00]  to all of you out there and uh i kind of made my way around i rolled in every neighborhood here that  would have me bed stye queens wow what made you want to do that like what happens where like you  you know you're a rock star and then obviously you're like i want to do this thing this is what  i want to do what happened it was a thought or it just became this obsession well the obsession is with  other people why would you want to be a singer or a broadcaster because you have an obsession with 
[00:34:30]  other people interacting with other people you know whether you're getting along with or antagonizing  it's just there's other folks involved you know as opposed but it's drastically different  the two professions that's right what blows our minds i think right well that's my first job  uh you know i can help trace it a little bit i don't know if i can psychoanalyze myself sorry i can  try some strong drink good luck good luck with that sorry it's just a question you have some bourbon right 
[00:35:00]  i'll psychoanalyze me i think it's fascinating  my first job out of high school was uh working in surgery  uh  very relaxed so i assisted during every kind of emergency surgery i worked in the emergency room 
[00:35:30]  and then i realized the girls thought it was romantic that you know i worked  and something like that  i'm always the the combination of those two things those two motivating factors always stuck with me 
[00:36:00]  and i always uh kept my hand in you know uh behind the scenes you know as far as you know camping and  climbing that somebody should know what to do so i'll take a one-week course you know or something  like that and um uh then a couple of things happened that really quickened my spirit for uh  you know putting on the uniform uh the first and probably the most clearly evident was that after i 
[00:36:30]  finished with van halen uh geez on my first album i rebuilt the pediatrics ward where we used to  hang hang out and uh put in a lifetime supply of ice cream in an industrial freezer for the kids  because i used to bum ice creams off the night nurse at two in the morning you follow the thinking  etc um at some point around mid 90s right around there earlier 90s it was grunge and it was kurt  cobain and i went from jeez i don't know we'll say 20 000 people to 2 000 people and playing those size 
[00:37:00]  venues i never did stop playing but you know you will be doomed to wander through the tina turner  desert for x amount of years love this the frank sinatra the emptiness you know all the great  artists or the rod stewart uh vastness you'll everybody has to go through that if you're going  to last 30 40 50 years yeah and uh i was no longer able to make a contribution and that's the key word  in my family with uh my pocketbook well i can still lift pretty heavy things i still have an interest in 
[00:37:30]  uh you know getting out amongst folks and that kind of energy you know something i was familiar with  grew up around it you know what kind of a kid becomes a cop usually one whose dad was a cop  what kind of kid runs into a burning building on with a fire hat on the one whose dad was  and you know on and on you know so i grew up around that element as well and uh also uh  in the little bit towards the late 80s somebody tried to kidnap my father with a loaded pistol 
[00:38:00]  and that kind of really brought into focus the combat part of being a combat hippie  was it random or were they targeting him or was it it was uh targeting and he was going to go put  him in the trunk and he was going to give me a call and the guy turned out to have a history yeah  he's going to ransom pop and uh age is an interesting thing in my family pop had just 
[00:38:30]  gotten his black belt he was almost 58 years old he's about as old as i am now but he had just  gotten his black belt and uh fellow walked into his office opened up a briefcase looking very you know  serious and everything it said i'm from the state i need to speak with you i need to sign some papers  there's a lawsuit or something whatever he went into the back room of his doctor's office in very uh  you know middle of nowhere southern california pulled out a loaded pistol and said to him okay 
[00:39:00]  i'm going to tie you up we're going to put you in the trunk of the car i know that this is the back  door here pop started talking him loose you know verbal judo we call the trucks you know hey relax  nurses come out here burst that door all the time just relax i'll do whatever  pop hit him oh yeah oh yeah wow lights right off and uh took off out the back door 
[00:39:30]  guy gets away pop is now at the house with bodyguards and fbi and you know and everybody you know hanging  around my house now looks like the berlin wall you know with the lights and the dogs and the guys you  know going up and down the uh walking the perimeter walkway exactly you know which sounds like fun but  it's a little scary these are nut cases you know and this is before there's really cell phones and  you know any kind of real interactive me you're you know you're much more separated yeah you're alone 
[00:40:00]  yeah and uh they caught the guy and uh they put him in lockup in little old pasadena which keep in  mind this is the 80s very different time and place because it's overbooked at the central jail  he stays in the drunk tank for month after month after month right and he's talking craziness this  guy's nutcase he's claiming to people you know uh that david lee roth is a close personal friend but  i stole his girlfriend elizabeth taylor that i telepathically robbed his mind for lyrics and that 
[00:40:30]  i now owe him telepathic money literally this all came back in questionnaire form when he's moving  from the uh police station and in total cowboy fashion yes things are different today count back  to the mid 80s late 80s 1986 87 in there he's being walked out by two cops from the front door of the  police station and two of his lowrider buddies bust him free at gunpoint wow wow put him in the back of 
[00:41:00]  uh a lowered whatever and go around the corner and take off this is how it was described to me okay  so he's now back at large the lights come back on the dogs are re-rented  holy  yeah you know you're you know you're now confronted with uh you know uh how do you protect yourself how 
[00:41:30]  are you going to arm yourself or do you go godfather and just hire a whole bunch of strangers  you're going to sleep on the job at the gate you know i'm sorry mr corleone says nobody leaves the  property yeah we'll get you your groceries go to the mattresses exactly like this um about a month  later they caught the guy again and he got into a gunfight with uh eagle the pet excuse me los  angeles pd and uh he died in a firefight underneath a parked car losing into that well you know now 
[00:42:00]  here comes the uh the credits and the outtakes when i turn to my dad and i go i'm thinking about taking  some shooting lessons yeah what about you he's going i'm thinking about carrying uh conceal  yeah yeah yeah i'm thinking about learning to shoot anything that comes in black  and he's going me too it's really scary this crazy guy actually convinced two other people to break  him out of jail that's what's even scary to me yeah right like that he's that nuts you figured 
[00:42:30]  nobody would listen to him but he had two friends they're like he found two yeah you know being that  popular a guy over the course of the years you must have had other instances where you directly were  the target of some you know people that might not have wanted to uh well yeah threats and invective and  you know particularly on the internet or somebody throws something over the the uh the gate you know  but it was those two those two uh experiences really yeah that just says hey you know what this could 
[00:43:00]  be a good thing i feel a kinship with uh all of my instructors and everybody that i work with  there you know i grew up around that in in the medical field as well as the martial arts field  i now have an extra uh an extra desire to be part of that community after you know my pops experience  whatever yeah i spent extra amounts of time then you know going to the shooting range ever get a 
[00:43:30]  concealed uh carry nope no no don't but uh i do know how to shoot pretty much anything that comes  in oh yeah that's uh so maybe i just wanted like a signed eight by ten headshot  he has a big fan you personalize it to him so that led to the ems control yeah let's have a t-shirt  part of it yeah huh that's very interesting one thing that when i was really young and i'll tell you  two funny stories about earth wind and fire in fact i'll tell you the first one it's with edward and i you  wonder where some of the conflict comes from is i was always pitching him you know my sisters and i 
[00:44:00]  went through the integrated busing program he went to the all-white schools and i kept saying there is  a great new band you gotta hear them they're called earth wind and fire and they're really popular you  know okay and this was before they became a uh a wedding yeah you would hear in september you're gonna  hear that at every farm yeah every graduate yeah i like a bunch of fire songs bingo it is the sound 
[00:44:30]  of when you don't tell anyone you like it just fill it in we would have had them if we could have  afforded it you know the name came up more than twice believe me believe me and uh they were brand  news like 1975 and uh you know keep in mind what eddie and i looked like with the hair down here you  know with the part in the middle and hands permanently in the pockets you know a boxer shorts etc camel not 
[00:45:00]  camel filters crushed up in the pocket of your pendleton shirt you know it was we were the only two  caucasian faces in the entire forum that's 22 000 people 22 000 of our closest friends earth wind has  just now started to break international market but it's an all-black audience eddie and i sit up in  the peanut gallery in the nosebleed seats we watched the show um i think you really enjoyed the show you 
[00:45:30]  know at that point in our career we were talking and but so we waited you know because we knew traffic  was going to be heavy duty you know we've been to a lot of shows there for other bands and um we waited  until there was just yeah most of the people were gone we come walking out in the parking lot there's  almost no cars one little you know opal cadet station wagon it looks like somebody drew it against the  background it's a cartoon and as we come up a hoodie african-american kid with a hoodie comes on 
[00:46:00]  you know he's got his hand in his pocket goes yo give me your money y'all and i looked at ed and ed  looked at me and i went do we look like we have any money no eddie has never been to another show  what are you doing to me coffee since then i don't know if it's connected  i'd love to think it is well you should have left with the crowd that was the mistake you made was  leaving late yeah right you should have filed out and just walked behind a group of black people and 
[00:46:30]  act like you were talking to them and you're just stuck in the car live and learn yeah no  shit don't hurt yourself  an entire generation and a half launching themselves off the top of uh toyota land cruisers  trying to touch their toes you can hear the the the belts popping i would come out after a show  yeah and you would invariably see uh there would be a pickup truck festooned with beer cans every 
[00:47:00]  single space that you could get a vertical empty beer can on in fact vertical empty beer can that  sounds like a bandit coachella and uh they would have it covered and somebody would get on the  bumper there would be three gals three guys and they'd launch themselves off the toe was that you  jay did you ever try that all the time jump off the bumper you know and try and touch their toes and  somebody go no that's not how you do it and clear off the hood you know and you hear the beer  cans and he'd climb up and launch and land in a heap much to the glee you know of the uh derision 
[00:47:30]  and ridicule of the crowd and somebody would do it from the top yeah until somebody snapped a leg  probably he told the best story on my podcast about van halen trying to expand their parameter  expand the parameters he said like when you're a kid you have bunk beds do you remember this whole  thing you said oh sure it was a mate we go ahead do it and i'll help you along let's see what you  remember from it when you're a kid you have bench uh bunk beds you put them a little farther apart  and you go hey uh let's see if we can make it this far apart from this bunk bed to that bunk bed 
[00:48:00]  uh-huh and then the whole band's like oh you know what put the bunk bed against the wall i'm eddie i  can do it better than dave i can do better than alex and my put all the way across the wall the ground  is lava if you touch the lava you're out hot lava you call it yes you have two bunk beds if the people  say i don't know why you interrupt me i'm in the middle of a really good story here jesus christ  i tried to get you to tell it i never got tired of doing that you have two bunk beds my sister 
[00:48:30]  slept in one i was in the other and you would jump across one to the other and go hot lava hot lava  and you didn't want to fall in but well you start off with a foot in between and then of course  they try and up the ante put it two feet apart sure you go hot lava and my career has been kind of  the same based on that ever since the beginning you know farther and farther apart how far away  can we move and still uh survive how what can we do musically that's going to push the advantage  a little bit more what can we try on stage you know what can we do on the album cover this time  that's farther and farther inevitably you're going to fall into the hot to the hot lobby yeah yeah and 
[00:49:00]  that's your best drinking story the record company comes in like with you know for we got ideas for  this album you guys could maybe take it in this direction and dave was like no you don't understand  we've already had the beds we're a different one outside and we jumped from the second  store window so uh the mood synthesizer what the fuck are you talking about we're already up to  out the window off the wall against the board it'd be really great if you guys could do a little

[00:54:30]  so while they're gone we're about halfway through 2013 and 2013 has been a year of years it's been  a wonderful year and so much has happened we thought we had to share everything so far with you uh all  this week james lipton was in studio this year it was only a few months ago he stopped by uh he was  talking about his new book but more importantly he talked about being a pimp in paris now you probably  read about this that james lipton from inside the actor's studio was once a pimp that he pimped hose 
[00:55:00]  but you didn't hear that it came from the opie anthony show that's because several months after this  interview happened some other news source some magazine article or something got the same story  and they went everywhere with it and everybody reported on it like it was news we had it first we  just don't have a great pr firm behind us however this is the evidence james lipton tells us the story 
[00:55:30]  way before he told anybody else on the worst of the year so far obviously uh we were astounded by the  list of people you have interviewed um it's it's quite extensive and uh an amazing array of celebrities  uh when did you when did you start uh interviewing people in this in this fashion 19 years ago that's 
[00:56:00]  it in 1994 when the earth was covered in mists i had an idea as a member of the actors studio that we ought to  uh created a degree granting program for the first time in the history of the studio which was then 47  years old and you know the people that had given us from james dean and and paul newman and and uh  marlon brando and so forth right up through pacino and through uh de niro and jack nicholson etc  and and and and i suggested at that time that we the studio first of all was a very private place it was a 
[00:56:30]  gymnasium and uh nobody was uh was allowed in from the outside it was a place where people could go  and what make mistakes why because you learn from your mistakes right but you don't want to make them  in public once you're famous so that's that's how it worked i said why don't we create a degree granting  program for the first time we don't have to let people in the studio is still on 44th street it's still  a private cranky place where nobody can get in but let's let this method that has been honed all these years 
[00:57:00]  out in a in an educational uh environment and that was how we started the actor studio drama school  which is now at pace university uh and when we started the actor studio drama school i had  uh i had people who would all of our core courses by the way are taught by life members of the actor's  studio that way we get the continuity that we wanted and uh so we had people who teach 30 weeks people 
[00:57:30]  would come in and do six fridays in a workshop but there was one category left that was unfilled  and that was those people who are members of the studio or friends of ours or colleagues with whom  we've worked who could only give us one one night of their lives so i sent a letter out and said will  you come and teach our students for one night paul newman answered dennis hopper answered sally field  answered i got these extraordinary people saying yes we'll do it and that's when i sent word back 
[00:58:00]  into the professional community i was by now dean of the active studio drama school which i had  i had created it so they made me they said well you'll you'll give it a year start start it you know  how long had you been at the studio by this time had you been there since only two years i'd been there  by then uh i was trained by stella adler and harold clerman and so um we uh i i got these responses and i  sent word back into the professional community from which i had come and i said look these people 
[00:58:30]  are liable to say something worth preserving and uh anybody interested because that means television  cameras and bravo took the existential leap with me at that time bravo had 20 million people  let's say and cable vision they were owned by cable vision there were 20 million subscribers  today we are in 94 million homes on bravo we are in 125 countries we have a record-breaking 15 emmy  nominations and if you had put a gun to my head in 1994 and said predict that or die i would have said 
[00:59:00]  pull the trigger can i ask will you do us such amazing prep for these interviews do you do publicists  give you the same thing they give us well you can't ask about this you can't ask what are the parameters  you allow we are about to do our 250th episode wow not one publicist has ever told me i can or cannot  do anything not one there is no pre-interview on our show we're the only talk show of our kind that has 
[00:59:30]  no pre-interview that's why i have to work for two weeks to do those three or four hundred cards all by  myself and and the and the the the result of that has been that the the guest walks in and has  absolutely no idea what's coming next that's the rigid rule on our show and nobody has ever asked to  violate it i'm amazed by that that level of trust for you it's trust and well they know that we're  going to talk about craft we don't we're not interested in gossip right we're a master's degree 
[01:00:00]  program those are master's degree candidates sitting out there at pace university and so uh  they know that we're not going to get into gossip we don't care about it we really don't care seriously  and what do we care about we care about the work they've done and if i were to ask you or you or  any of anybody in this room look i'm going to interview you and what we'll talk about i'm just  going to ask you about those turning points in your life that made you whoever the hell you are now  both as a as an artist in our case of our show and as a person and you start and i and i i've done 
[01:00:30]  my research and i know that there was a turning point something somebody died therefore sure this  and so i asked them i described to me what happened and then they they tell me what happened and in  doing so what happens it's it's called effective memory in the stanislavsky system what happens is the  emotions that they felt at the time begin to come back and as a result we became to my absolute  astonishment the most intimate and the most emotional show of our kind who gave you the 
[01:01:00]  most emotional interview that you can think of or one yeah look when i was asked over and over again  over the years who's the guest you want the most i said look i was for 10 years the dean of the  actor studio drama school i was his founding dean i'm no longer steen i'm dean emeritus and i and i i  said the night that one of my graduated students has achieved so much that he or she walks out on  that stage and sits down in that chair next to me is going to be the night i've waited for since we 
[01:01:30]  started this program and bradley cooper graduated in 2000 we trained him for three years and when bradley  walked out on that stage he looked at me and i looked at him we burst into tears and we had this wow we  we couldn't go on with the show for a bit until both of us had recovered so uh there is that kind  of emotional attachment uh in the show that again doesn't make us better i hope it doesn't make us  worse but it sure as hell makes us different yeah and it's uh it's honest i mean obviously not talking 
[01:02:00]  about uh the gossipy end of it just the the craft uh and and just open honesty about i think people feel  safe there too it doesn't feel like they're going to be blindsided by some tmz uh reporter no because  that's look we're a master's class class in university we don't care about those things our  students don't care they would be disappointed in me if i asked a question about right nothing to do  with with the reason that we're all there and uh the result for us for our students remember they 
[01:02:30]  come from a hundred we're in 125 countries that's not a joke we were immense in france in in in japan  in australia in the scandinavian countries in latin america the show is just huge and uh the uh the  result is that our students come to us from all over the world and they come to us for a reason and  the guests know that there's a reason and therefore the guests have a reason for coming there which is to 
[01:03:00]  teach them and it turned out i thought it would be so dull i thought it'd be so dry i'm serious  i thought we wouldn't last a year here we are 19 years the second longest running show in the history  of cable television all of these things it sounds like i'm bragging i maybe i am but it's also the  truth and uh and it's not something that i had anticipated or even planned it just evolved organically  the way an acting role is supposed to yeah how did you um accept uh being thrust into pop culture 
[01:03:30]  like that i mean the parodies that have uh been done about you which are hilarious i i i it appears  that i it appears that i am a figure in pop culture sure watch arrested development when it comes back  on the air netflix i'm back on the show the warden gentles like the character that i created on the  original show i'm back on on the air the uh the will ferrell of course yeah we all know about that 
[01:04:00]  and it is it's not something that i can plan but it is something that to be perfectly frank that i  treasure yeah i mean will's a friend that he asked me to be in in his his movie with him which i did  and uh and the uh this thing has evolved too over the years this this uh this relationship  do i like it people ask me do you hate it hate it i would i would crawl on broken glass to have 
[01:04:30]  this the kind of thing happen to me it must have been odd though to be the dean of of a university  happening at once i was d i was one of seven deans in a university which is an academic position  of course and at the same time all this madness was happening yeah what a you that's an amazing  story of all the people you've talked to what was uh something that shocked you like what's the 
[01:05:00]  piece of information somebody gave you the most shocking one i think  well brace yourselves it's quite a tale it's brief jack lemon was on i'd known jack lemon when i was a  young actor and came to new york and he was already a famous actor and um jack was you may know an  absolutely elegant human being and it was near the end of his life just a few months to the end of his  life and he was on the show and because i'm dean of the school i'm always trying to make a point for 
[01:05:30]  the actors i'm didactic which is one of the things people make fun of me for some people dislike me  for they think it makes me pompous and um but i'm always trying to teach them something and so i was  here i was working with jack and we were talking about days of wine and roses and i said to him you  know uh the uh the all the famous scenes in it the scene next to the crib with the child the scene in  in the greenhouse when you smash it trying to find a bottle that you can't you you stowed there 
[01:06:00]  the scene when you're arrested all those huge scenes emotional scenes but the most moving the  most thrilling scene in the movie is the quietest when you stand up in front of the of a.a for the  first time and say those historic words and then i paused i'm always trying to get my guest i tried to  get de niro to say you're talking to me wouldn't do it i did get uh tom hanks to say uh uh life is 
[01:06:30]  like a box of chocolate and i waited for him to say it and he's and he said it he said my name is he  couldn't recall and he said my name is so and so and i'm an alcoholic and i turned to the students and i  said see look no pushing no pushing no begging for anything just do it just do what the character does  and let the audience provide the emotion see no pushing i said that's acting and he said no it's not 
[01:07:00]  i'm an alcoholic oh wow wow and there follows a 15 second pause which i kept in the edit because i  edited the show and it's right there and we just stare at each other and i saw he didn't want to  go any further and oh wow to the next question but it was the most startling moment in the history of  the show and afterward his wife said to me in the green room first time jack's ever said that in  public wow so the fact that he said that i guess obviously meant he was in recovery and had kept 
[01:07:30]  that private wow that's yeah he was yeah but he had never admitted to it in in public in his life  until that moment would you call that a surprise yeah yeah well not in this studio i wouldn't  come on i enjoy a couple of beers myself but you're an interesting guy too in that you like  how much of this is folklore but back in france when you were a younger guy you you know what what is  this oh god are you going there we have to ask yeah you were ahead you were uh you were i don't 
[01:08:00]  want to say a pimp per se but i was a mech macro uh which is not which is not strictly speaking a pimp  um uh a pimp is somebody who exploits the women who work for him and generally speaking that  relationship nowadays it's unthinkable unthinkable i'm talking about when i was a youngster this is long  long ago where it was all regulated in france and so forth but it a pimp exploits the women off and 
[01:08:30]  often treats them horribly we know that but a macro works for the women they employ him and i was  living in i was living in paris i had no i couldn't get a work permit it was out of the question in  those days were you acting there are you there i had gone i was i had been acting in greece in a film  and then i came back and i didn't want to come back to the united states for a while i wanted to  live in europe and i particularly wanted to live in paris this expression in french called french  called rite de passage rites of passage uh i was going through it and i wanted to continue to go 
[01:09:00]  through it and i had met by chance because i had gone as as americans did in those days to the rupi gala  to see a sex exhibition which was in those days was commonplace in paris and in america didn't exist at  all and uh afterward i had had a drink in the bar in the bordello and met the young woman who had  participated in this and we became friends she was from can she was beautiful young canoise and in those 
[01:09:30]  days uh the it was the france was going through a very hard time and the men couldn't get work and  certainly the women couldn't and there was no opprobrium associated with uh women who went into what is  called what was called the milieu which is that world uh and then came out of it no the names i  could name for you movie stars and so forth who were in it for a time and there was nothing there 
[01:10:00]  were students who were in it who were earning their way through school women who were supporting their  husbands who were going to college for example uh they were it was an entirely different world and  completely regulated medically regulated everything anyway uh then when i ran out of money she suggested  that i would become her mech so that i could stay there and we could continue our friendship and our  relationship and i did and it was the most one of the most interesting years of my life now you know 
[01:10:30]  the whole story wow wow but what is the one of the responsibilities of uh i would i would go to the i  would probably i'm mopping up in the morning i would appear at american express which is where all the  tourists turned up especially the american tourists uh right next to the uh uh to the palais garnier  uh and uh to the paris opera and uh other people would be there saying would you like i i conduct tours  would you like to see chartre would you like to see notre dame de paris etc all these people would be these 
[01:11:00]  tour guides i was a tour guide i would say you want to see some sex  and uh and uh these americans startled americans would say yes this is really what they came to  paris for in those days and uh then when was this when was this roughly 1950s oh okay and uh so you  know france is still recovering from the second world war and uh and the um then they i would have to go  with them because they were nervous they were frightened about it and so i would take them there to the 
[01:11:30]  the bordello and and my girlfriend and another woman or a man or whatever it was we had arranged  this thing would occur and uh uh they were these people were electrified by it and they would ask me  to translate for them and speak to these people and tell them what they wanted to see and so forth  um so it was a very strange time in my life but it was it was literally the only way i could remain  in france i couldn't live in any other way i would gladly have done something else now that's probably a  a much more fun way to make a living yeah well did you get involved interesting were you a part of 
[01:12:00]  what do you mean by get involved well you know i mean what i would love to have done no no i mean  she was my girlfriend for christine yeah yeah i wasn't gonna you know betray her with even with her  wow follow me it's very complicated you didn't get jealous no no no well she wasn't it was it was  we were we were friends we were really friends more than anything else right yeah and uh and she 
[01:12:30]  had arranged for this it had to be arranged for her they would have found me floating in the sand  because you couldn't you couldn't practice that profession uh unless you had been endorsed okay  and so i she got me endorsed wow what a great story i've never discussed this with anybody else  before on radio it's it's it's quite amazing uh part of of your history and just part of history  i we we never do that i never would i never would have uh discussed it at all i did in my memoir 
[01:13:00]  inside inside yeah it's there in black and white for everybody to read but uh arthur lawrence the great  playwright had been there and a whole with a whole group of people with stella adder who was my acting  teacher and they were all there in paris they came for the summer and i was there and that was when i was  working and they asked me to her and i took them all and arranged one for them this as a sex exhibition  and and uh arthur wrote about it in his memoir oh really yeah six years ago just before i wrote my 
[01:13:30]  my my memoir and uh he talked about it and he and um uh and so i felt it he had outed me did he drop  your name in there drop my name i thought maybe it was an anonymous type of the guy who hosts the actor  studio i wasn't that then he called me the sex guide wow and uh and so once that had been done 
[01:14:00]  i had there was nothing i could do about it except own a memoir to put it on record truthfully once and  for all when julia roberts was on my show years ago and julia had played of course a prostitute  famously and uh i said did we interview prostitutes and so well she said yes and we got into that and  then i began to talk about i said well when i was in france i i and so forth and then i now i realized  i had trapped myself like that was long before i ever discussed it and i didn't want to go any further  with it and julia got she started laughing she couldn't stop laughing and it's one of the most famous 
[01:14:30]  moments on the show where i was just sort of fumbling around and i didn't know what to say or  how to get out of it and julia could not stop laughing i'd drink her water and her teeth were  rattling on the glass she let you off the hook or she probably could have pursued it oh she didn't  but i didn't confess anything all right right it wasn't until arthur lawrence wrote about it as an  experience of his life that i decided i'd better set the record straight such as it is that's an  interesting story and you know what it's so it it's it's in a time in history where it doesn't seem as 
[01:15:00]  as seedy as anything like that now listen the women who were in the milieu in those days were  some of them were very very elegant and uh and it was and as i say they were examined weekly by a  doctor it was completely regulated the some of the bordellos of that time were among the most famous in  the history of the world these women were like geishas and uh they were so royally treated uh and um  uh and as they as i said women moved in and out they they needed the money they were desperate 
[01:15:30]  and so they would do this for a while then would come out of it people would know that they were  in it there's a very famous very very famous french movie star who was in and out of that media i won't  say who it was and uh that's not my right and but i know she was and and uh when they when they came  when they came when they came when they came out of it there was no opprobrium whatsoever people never  even gave it a thought wow the french have always been look we're the united states of america we're  uptight what tradition do we have that the french do not have the puritan tradition there is a puritan 
[01:16:00]  tradition in america which we inherited absolutely but the catholic countries of europe france and uh  and italy and so forth do not have a puritan tradition as a result they look as neither does asia  neither does japan for example and so in those countries you don't find the same kind of nervousness  or obsession with sex they're much less ex actually much less obsessed less just less  one of the problems with the catholic church today is that it has become absolutely riveted on the 
[01:16:30]  subject of sex right yeah and i'm not criticizing them that's their right but but it is a fact and uh and  the um uh they are they are more sophisticated perhaps about it or and certainly more casual about it they  don't see it as a uh as as every encounter as a life-changing event sure i'm not saying that's  right or wrong but it's it's different from our own tradition we are more uh uptight and it has to do 
[01:17:00]  with our puritan tradition yeah absolutely i think it takes away from some things that could be you know  art i think it takes away from art in this country japanese art the greatest japanese artists the  the rembrandts and the davinci's uh of japan all painted pornography pure pure graphic pornography  my wife is half japanese and half irish and she studied art with a great japanese artist he was a 
[01:17:30]  national treasure they declare them national treasures in japan and he gave her as a gift once this we  it hangs in our house this painting by a master of one of the 18th century masters of japanese painting  and it is a pure pornographic and it has a a place in your home right there prominently displayed  pride of place you see that's wonderful i love it why not absolutely why not absolutely did you study 
[01:18:00]  with uh did brando study with stella stella adler brando studied with stella adler denira studied with  stella adler harvey keitel studied with stella adler i studied with her for two and a half years  she taught for two years and actually i was uh she asked me to stay for another six months  which i did and worked with her she was the greatest single academic influence on my life did you so you  knew brando yes i knew brando when he was when i first came to new york he was already  you know a star but he uh i did know him quite well you know i'm always fascinated with people 
[01:18:30]  who got to know him because uh he seems like one of these guys that was rather difficult to get to  know like i at the end of his life i was always trying to get him to be on inside the actor's  studio by then he was reclusive and he would sit up in his home and he and he would make phone calls  he would call me and uh we would talk for 45 minutes but he would never appear on the show by then  he would not come out of his house and and uh he was very very very bizarre he speaks to me in 
[01:19:00]  spanish and i said i don't speak spanish and then he would stop but we used to talk for a long time  i said why don't we say this on the air for god right right and uh no but he wouldn't do it so he's  one that got away but he by then it wouldn't have been very valuable anyway because he had spit the  bit he was no longer interested in acting and he contemned it and he hated himself as we all know 
[01:19:30]  uh it ended poorly yeah but when i first saw him when i first came to new york i saw him in streetcar  oh wow and uh he was the greatest actor i ever saw did he really dislike like guys like rod steiger  because there's this famous story about when they were doing that that you know i could have been a  contender charlie that he wouldn't even do the lodge close-ups with him that he just he hated his  acting is that true i have no idea i don't know i don't answer that i i don't know that he did uh  but certainly that scene is justly famous he did everything wrong in it he did everything 
[01:20:00]  unpredictable in it what instead of being angry at his brother instead of being frightened of his  brother the two things that you would think that any actor would have chosen made made those choices  in the scene his brother was destroying him at that moment what was he instead he was heartbroken  he was heartbroken that his brother would do it was the most amazing choice and only a brando could 
[01:20:30]  have made it i think that nothing nothing impresses me in an actor more than risk if an actor takes chances  and is utterly unpredictable then i know i'm in the presence of a great actor and what there's one  more ingredient that's necessary if the actor first you are absolutely startled by his choices or her 
[01:21:00]  choices and in the end you realize they were what inevitable that's what makes a great great actor and  that's why brando to my taste is the greatest of his time and the weekend we have some great ones going  now who do you think is unpredictable now like completely who shot philip seymour hoffman yeah  wow he is good yeah that's a good one yeah did uh did brando ever talk about acting and and the actual 
[01:21:30]  craft of acting in public in any way yeah he he um he decided after i started inside the actor's studio  i think he was inspired by he because he's a member of the actor's studio he's so aware of it he decided he  was going to teach a class in los angeles advertisements went out people walked um  and uh they rushed to be taught by marlon brando and they arrived at the appointed place and he was  waited for the door to open for him to come in he walked in a dress as i recall 
[01:22:00]  it lasted i think about 24 hours by then he was two he hated acting he thought that acting was not  was not a worthy profession and you know why because he was a genius geniuses make one mistake  consistently they think that whatever they do is easy why because it's easy for them  and they didn't have to learn it because it came from instinctively and as a result they think it's 
[01:22:30]  easy and it's easy for them to become contemptuous of because look i'm doing this thing what what's  so special about what i'm doing why should anybody make a fuss and eventually people  like brando become contentious for example uh ted williams had to teach himself every moment of  swinging a bat he could teach you how to swing a bat because he had had to teach himself he wasn't  a genius what he was was a great great great great student and he taught himself how to do it willie 
[01:23:00]  mays never gave it a minute's thought in his life he was a genius it just happened he would get up there  he'd swing the bat and he'd hit a home run uh there are those two kinds of those two approaches to a  craft and and marlon was absolutely a genius he just was able to do it now he was well trained by  stella adler he had a thorough training from her when you put together technique with talent you can't  teach talent talent's what you bring to the table and what that's like and exactly i said i wonder what that's 
[01:23:30]  like i'm sure you know and but but uh you put together talent and technique and then out comes  some brando you know i can't even watch movies like a miracle on 34th street was on recently i just  can't watch things from that era anymore because again like watching guys like brando and like  hoppin or whoever i can't watch the old school acting anymore it just seems so disconnected to  anything because it was english acting until the stanisofsky system took hold in america through the group 
[01:24:00]  theater out of which came stella adler and lee strassberg and all the teachers whom i have  studied with um they until then it was a pale imitation of english theater they had a kind of  false english accent everything had to look good and they practiced in front of a mirror until they  had themselves just the way they wanted none of it was organic none of it was felt none of it was emotional  none of it was real it was all a system of of opposing of of it was rhetorical uh it was uh 
[01:24:30]  it was essentially false very much like old stage acting that's what i'm talking about yeah it was  theater acting yeah they took it to film but then when the group when the when the moscow art theater  on stanislavsky came here in the 1920s there was a revolution and uh that was when uh strassberg and stella  adler and herald clurman and charl crawford they saw what was happening on that stage and they knew 
[01:25:00]  that the door had opened it would never close again and then they founded the group theater  out of that came the plays of odette's out of that came all of our greatest actors and today it is  it's transcendent in the world there is no actor who's not touched by it in one way or another and  in america we've had some very very very great teachers the greatest whom i thought was stella adler  and uh and she did teach brando and once again there with me i brought a minimal talent to it so i  was okay but he brought this great talent put it together with her with her technique and out came 
[01:25:30]  uh a very great actor this footage oh they seem like yeah unfortunately i just want to ask one more  question did they say this foot i'm not a fan of shakespeare i can't enjoy it but i watched brando doing  like uh you know uh you know the season he was the mark anthony i think he was doing and i couldn't  take my eyes off it because it was like this is the only guy i've ever seen do it neither could the  english actors i remember once uh one of the english actors on my show was at tony hopkins or 
[01:26:00]  john hurt i've forgotten which one it was he and mckellen they said to me look at the julius caesar  you'll see what brando was doing was he here we all came with this classical training with the perfect  body the perfect voice the perfect uh behavior and brando came on that screen and we were all of us in  the shadow and uh and he was he was able to bring to it uh the kind of of of of deeply felt 
[01:26:30]  emotions of american training and acting uh when applied to shakespeare who was that was a great  writer of emotion a great writer of feeling a great writer of character and when you put those  two together then you've got a performance like brando's but i mean others do it very well i think  tony hopkins is a perfect combination when he was on my show he told me that while he was studying 
[01:27:00]  at the royal academy in london learning the kind of acting that we all associate with um with  shakespeare and with english tradition uh he was sneaking off and studying stanislavski with an  actor acting teacher in london and putting the two of them together and when you put that exterior  technique which is external in which certain aspects of the character are acquired externally  together with a an internal technique that digs deep into your own soul and makes you recreate 
[01:27:30]  whatever it was that shakespeare wrote and said uh organically from your own life experience and from your  own uh deepest deepest the marrow of your bones then you get the kind of exquisite acting that all of us can  react to and never forget yeah wow so so rare to see that they're telling us what they're oh yeah  yeah you're you have other press you get a lot more press you're very busy today apparently uh james 
[01:28:00]  is promoting of course inside the actor's studio it's it's an amazing show you get more out of actors  you watch tina fey which is tomorrow night on bravo and you we talked about what improvisation  because she came from second city she gives a lesson in improvisation that is incomparable and  guess what we then improvised and i was allowed by her to interview sarah palin oh she does watch it 
[01:28:30]  yep she does sarah but we do about eight minutes together of sarah palin of her sarah palin  and it is absolutely extraordinary you know that and it's improvisation it's totally  improv we're both improvising you just you're an amazing interviewer and a great guest and uh  you know yeah thanks so much what you get out of actors is amazing no one gets that coming  stuff out of them thank you fantastic thanks for coming in and i think a great interviewer gets  things out of people like you know some people got james to talk about things that he hasn't talked  about right jimmy yeah my my wife is if she hears this she's going to kill me meanwhile you should 
[01:29:00]  have maybe gotten an acting lesson from him instead of acting yeah i really should have i do things that are  unpredictable too i forget the lines and when i do remember i suck jimmy has a problem he doesn't  know what to do with his hands to make them look natural as he's acting yes you see they're by there  or fault hands are the problem look at you watch humphrey bogart bogart never figured out what to do  with his hands he usually tucks them into the belt of his pants really bogart couldn't even figure it 
[01:29:30]  out he watch him he was never comfortable with his hands i find that like what i'll do is i'll just talk  i'll just put them over my head out of frame people just forget that that's why in the k mutiny he was  doing that with the marvels but he just brought those one day it wasn't even part of the uh script  the worst is yet to come this is only his worst of 2013 so far  on the opian anthony channel hey this is meg griffin sirius xm channels can now be personalized  to fit your taste with my sxm like on my channel classic vinyl you can hear more early vinyl

[01:42:00]  fucking doing i'm looking for a ending to this bit  the worst part of that is the look oh i know you knew how to look  did you look like that yeah i was really i was a monumentally unpleasant now of course that was like  an exaggeration almost like a brewer character but i mean that that does never a happy drunk  never even in the beginning like some people they start out a little bit of like a drinker too i 
[01:42:30]  was fucking you know i was charlie cheery but then by fucking drink three i was dan dreary and  my fucking drink five i was oscar obnoxious and i wish i looked like a superhero oh you do jimmy  you've lost so much weight it looks so good you want to be a superhero what would what kind of  superhero though i don't know a lot to choose from i would just go around helping people yeah  yes grocery man like if you have too many groceries i would zip it and carry them up for 
[01:43:00]  you grocery man he's very helpful like this is a woman walking and she doesn't realize that her  lettuce is falling out uh-huh and her lettuce falls out of the bag and all of a sudden you  and i fly and i catch her lettuce and i place it back in her bag and i say there you are ma'am  and what does she say oh thank you grocery man of course i zip away thank you grocery man and  fly away it's a blurb on page 26 of the paper grocery man but meanwhile i'm flying over and 
[01:43:30]  around rapes and child kidnappings and i'm ignoring them to help someone like i'll zip into like the  whole foods and just as the guy is about to put the heavy milk on top of the eggs i i  grab i grab the milk out of his hand and i say son look at the bottom of that bag oh  he'll say oh grocery man thank you i forgot there were eggs in there wow don't put that on the eggs  i'll say and all of a sudden i go and i've got a plastic bag out and i put his milk in it 
[01:44:00]  and i fly away do you bag groceries for old people real quick yes i do if they have to do it themselves  yeah yeah well it's just like the old lady is paying oh my arthritis is bothering me and she's  looking at all her groceries pile up off the little conveyor belt yeah and then she pays then you're  and all of a sudden i'm there and i give her this salute all her bags are in the car wow and i say  have a safe trip home ma'am oh thank you grocery man yeah and you fly out and there's somebody getting 
[01:44:30]  fucking robbed in the parking lot yes there is pistol whipped yes the gentleman of color is taking  the butt of his gun and caving it into the nose of another old woman but since she has no groceries  i allow that i allow that to happen it's the worst you have a code yes yes yes i'm only here to help with  groceries yeah that would do well at the box office oh yeah priorities there's the one scene where the 
[01:45:00]  woman is walking with her groceries and in slow motion you see the handle break oh  shit that'll happen yeah begin tumbling oh man and meanwhile i'm somewhere i just you see me look  up and then you could sense that i sense the groceries are falling and then i jump out the  window and i change into my outfit as i'm falling and i fly down with a fresh bag and i catch all of  her groceries wow before they hit the ground that's pretty quick yeah and i just put them in her bag  like and i go here you are ma'am and i take the other bag no littering oh man that's pretty good yes 
[01:45:30]  it is is there a scene in the movie where uh something happens to you and you're not available  and and and uh somebody's groceries maybe fall out of the back of their truck while they're loading it  up that's like then everybody stops and they're like where's grocery man yes you see milk it's in  the slow motion the milk hits the sidewalk and the milk splatters in slow motion oh boy and everyone 
[01:46:00]  stops like traffic stops they all just look at the milk and they know grocery man is injured  mama we're grocery man grocery man pick up grocery and i'm wearing my grocery man outfit is like a  green cape that that's but it's the consistency of lettuce this is terrible no it's not do you have a  symbol um yes is there like a grocery symbol when when there's trouble yes there there is like uh it'll 
[01:46:30]  just be a a tipped over bag with items falling out wow is that on your chest no my chest is a paper  bag with two healthy handles and a smile on the front which signifies happy groceries inside  grocery man will come i fucking hate grocery man helpful he's not helpful yes he is he's so  not helpful yes he is he flies in a lot of times like somebody will be going to take an item off the 
[01:47:00]  shelf it's past the expiration date oh wow and as they go to put it in their cart all of a sudden  flies by and it's out of their hand what if they're a bunch of bad grocery things happening at one time  he just fucking is that quick wow i go everywhere he's take care of everything he's just fucking  that and they go to put something into the car past the expiration and i snatches it out of their hand  wow do you chastise people for leaving their carts like across the aisle when you're trying to 
[01:47:30]  fucking get through and they're looking for some stupid shit but they block the whole  fucking aisle  so there's a grab tell you the climax there's a scene where there's a guy pushing carts and he's  got like 50 carts and but there's a car coming oh down there and he doesn't see the car guy  shit and grocery man flies in and lands right in front of the car the car the car puts his hand up  in the stop motion oh and the car stops and then he waves the carriage guy across the street oh my god 
[01:48:00]  what an insignificant hero yeah it doesn't even sound like you're a nemesis you're just helping  people this is probably e-rock wants to eat all the groceries no my nemesis my nemesis is  expiration dates oh oh wow and and poorly packed grocery bags that's my nemesis there are many  nemeses of mine and i must stop them all in all lands i don't think uh this would gross as much as  iron man this would yeah i'm putting it head to head grocery man one iron man sticks against iron man 
[01:48:30]  three yes grocery man flies around yeah and helps everyone with their groceries who are you thinking uh  to play grocery man for the big movie moi you yes oh wow i am grocery man that's amazing especially  with my new physique yeah i'd go is there a love interest to get the female audience oh yeah there  should be a love interest there's gotta be come on yes who only she's the only one who knows your 
[01:49:00]  identity grocery man's got a really weird love interest oh no no her name is betsy oh betsy yes and  she has cerebral palsy oh okay why why i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i read  out of improv no no i'll tell you why because that's how he because he he met her because of her  cerebral palsy she was always dropping groceries oh and that's something grocery man hates yeah so he 
[01:49:30]  just he began and he fell in love with her after he helped her but she she dropped another can of  peaches why peaches every day she loves peaches because uh they're just fun to hold with her  up hands yeah and uh she dropped the can under on the on the bone of her foot ah and she was like ah  and the grocery man flew in saved her yes helped her out yes nice gross and then he made love to her  violently while she laid on her side 
[01:50:00]  grocery man has no ethics her hand her hand was propped up stiffly like a praying mantis hand  grocery man it's not uh against his um his ethics to uh no to use his grocery man status to get laid  no what he does is is like when a woman uh he takes his lettuce cape and he covers their face with it  and he violently makes love to them violently yes betsy with cerebral palsy yeah his gal yes 
[01:50:30]  she's 52 52 52 yeah it's gonna be a hit with all the kids this will not fucking gross 10 bucks  i think this would be a hit no you know what happened if this could be such a big hit that  the headline is gonna read grocery man g-r-o-s-s dance oh yeah for the gross yeah the big box office  gross the box office gross yeah rotten tomatoes not in this movie ah yes eh oh boy how did grocery 
[01:51:00]  man first find out he had these powers when he was a boy when he was just a baby his mother was  running around flexing around and uh something fell off the shelf yeah she was making some baby food  and she went like she screamed ah she's the baby food falling there's a little fat baby hand caught  it oh grocery man caught it and held it up like mama and she looked all like oh my god you were in  the other room what happened yeah cross me that was his first his first word was grocery fat

[01:56:30]  sir worst of 2013 so far while opie anthony are on vacation i sam roberts will spend the week bringing  you the best moments the opie anthony show has had this year now we've been following the pendulet  trace atkins thing going on we were able to have trace atkins in studio after we had penn after we  broke down what the two were doing and who was really more likely to win trace atkins stopped by  and you know what pendulet is a friend of the opie anthony show but when you look at a guy like trace 
[01:57:00]  atkins and when you have a great time with a guy like trace atkins makes it goddamn hard to stay loyal  trace atkins judge for yourself on the worst of 2013 so far opie anthony's worst of 2013 so far  on the opie anthony channel trace atkins here comes the magnolia bakery treats those are  yes that's not trace atkins no it doesn't that's that's the wife that shot him that was like  should we not bring that up oh god damn right hi i'm trace atkins there he is trace trace atkins 
[01:57:30]  ah take a seat over here right up pull up a mic we're on the air uh live we just do this like  look at there's the voice they told me y'all were so oh yeah god damn trace atkins let me tell you  something we're really good mitts on him too i know do you know colin quinn stop holding my hand quinn  how you doing back in the day yeah you guys know each other no no but i'm a fan i'm a fan conklin 
[01:58:00]  and tom popper to your right hey trace he's gonna be he's good friends with the jerry seinfeld that's  his claim no i mean he's acting with michael douglas in a new movie and that liberace movie  liberace movie oh yeah really i'll brag for my pal tom popper so thank you he's uh he's  you want to see that trace or any of his buddies down there are going to go see that liberace  hells no i'm probably not  we had a pendulet in here yesterday oh yeah and he was pitching his uh ice cream uh you know 
[01:58:30]  apprentice uh a celebrity all-star friggin amazing uh apprentice this season uh you guys are head-to-head  now yeah so now now the object is to to sell this ice cream yes at this point right how do you feel  you're doing i'm doing great i got a i got a little pint of penn's ice cream yesterday i found a booger  right on the booger right on the top there's a booger on the top of it so his ice cream has boogers in 
[01:59:00]  it i'm just telling you that could be detrimental to ice cream sales at least i tried to disguise mine with  macadamia nuts so something falls in there during production people think it's a macadamia right  that's a good strategy but his just has boogers but we got to explain the trace we're really good  friends with pendulet he does the show a lot but then we kind of started looking into your history  and we're all in we're hoping you win this thing is sunk because your back your back story is way  better than pendulet's absolutely as far as uh as far as country artists go you fit that bill that 
[01:59:30]  everyone has stereotyped over the years of taking tragedy and turning it around making uh you know  pulling yourself up by the proverbial bootstraps as they say uh well i suppose so that's why i've  i think i've written one positive love song in my life and i was commissioned to write that one  uh and i think that's about it you came up as a working guy you know you worked in  i worked in i worked in oil field for 10 years oil field i worked offshore on drilling rig for uh 
[02:00:00]  six years roughneck work derrick's wow so that's a real job my finger off yeah yeah you apparently  we read you you cut your finger off yeah i cut that one off it was then right off it's it's permanently  they put it back on they put it back on but it's bent like that the doctor asked me he said uh it's not  gonna work anymore i think i can save it but how do you want you want it straight and i said no i said put it  it in a sus position so now you can play i said at least i can suspend a d or a g you know 
[02:00:30]  i said put it in the sus position he went excuse me i showed him with my other hand i said dude like  that that's having some forethought well dude no not really because i mean the second that i cut it  that was the first thing i thought well there goes my guitar playing you know  pretty much over at that point wow there's no way he's seeing liberaci  no no no it's not no wait you worked in those oil rigs like off the coast and stuff yeah wow  that's where the offshore ones are jesus christ yeah oh no i hung out to dry there i'm sorry colin 
[02:01:00]  i told colin i'd be nice to him when another guest was in and by the way as bobby kelly pointed out to  me it was always funny to me when it was boss or bobby kelly then it was me then i was like oh this is  not funny at all right that's true man that thing you and seinfeld did a while back was brilliant oh  thanks damn absolutely brilliant the one-man show that was brilliant he's got a new one that we saw  last night that was great great i'll bust it out i want to that's great i'm all over it i'm in 
[02:01:30]  he does uh do a great day what are your street theater what are your uh i could uh i could probably  guess but your political affiliations as far as uh that things that are going on the news these days  the the what i say is the dismantling of the constitution do you get involved in much of  that well i don't get involved in it you know i don't uh and people know that too they come to my  shows and they're not going to get beat over the head with any that's good i don't do that i and i  never have and i you know what and i and i don't like people that do but at least you know some of the 
[02:02:00]  ones that do it they're right up front with it and you know that going in that you're going to get  that i don't like to be ambushed by somebody right right right but anyway yeah i'm i'm pretty conservative guy  sure uh you know and uh what's going on right now you know i believe that uh when the government  starts using agencies to persecute people that they have political and philosophical differences  with that's tyranny my friend thank you absolutely god damn i gotta agree and and with that fucking  voice saying it like that yep that that means business it makes you believe i agree okay god it's 
[02:02:30]  so nice it's so refreshing to see somebody in in the business that we call show right uh  that well i'm sure you heard something uh similar to that from penn yesterday well yeah yeah a little  bit penn again also doesn't really put himself out there uh politically much yeah he is a libertarian  and an atheist he's sort of a libertarian yeah yeah he's a quasi-libertarian quasi-libertarian  is just a republican who smokes dope that's really true uh do you uh do you uh do you go shooting 
[02:03:00]  and stuff yeah i've heard something needs shooting no very good yeah do you do i mean i i i enjoy uh  a little gun uh gunfire um but i i go to the range you know there's not much not much going on well  i do appreciate my second amendment right i've got a lot of guns i've defended as many goods as he does  i got i got a lot it's very difficult in new york too well i don't have a predator drone i want one  of those he's got i want a drone man well and i i got a pretty big one with cameras on it and stuff 
[02:03:30]  i could send it up autonomously to patrol the neighborhood awesome awesome that's great  monitored some people getting a pizza delivery the other day it was very exciting very compelling video  uh i got from that one but uh no i really do and in new york it's very difficult uh as you probably  know to even uh say that you you own guns but um no i love it i bought i picked up a barrett uh  50 cal they make those just right down the road from where i live in murfreesboro tennessee oh 
[02:04:00]  isn't that fantastic you ever fire one of those i have a lot of fun i don't have one yet i'm about  to get one i just got a desert eagle 50 caliber i got one of those oh wow what a treat you take  that down to the indoor range and they won't they won't at my my indoor range they won't let me  shoot it they won't no uh over here now so they let me but you watch everybody from all the other  slots they peek their head around like right yeah somebody's got a camera is he firing that is you  know what it's a 50 caliber pistol yeah it's the arnold schwarzenberg one from that uh yeah the guy that 
[02:04:30]  i got it from you know he said dude don't ever shoot anybody in your house with this  it's not the most practical wait till they go outside because it will make a mess  it's not the most practical gun to have but it is a lot of fun i'm not i'm not worried about the killing  i'm worried about the cleanup the mess you shoot a melon with that thing and it just you can't 
[02:05:00]  it explodes it's fantastic it's fun to shoot yeah it is is it heavy yeah yeah very you could  and you put a full magazine in there because the the shells are really really big you could bludgeon  so you could do some damage with just beating someone you don't have to shoot  we gotta ask you man speaking of shooting what we learned about you yesterday you got shot in the  heart yeah jeez holy how'd that happen the story is really mad woman 
[02:05:30]  really yeah you know and she she had the pistol and uh and it was uh i learned a very good life  lesson from that um i held my hand out like this and i said give me that pistol or i'm gonna take  it away from you and beat your goddamn brains out with it oh and she stuck it under my arm and  bullet went in here and came out here wow it went straight across the chest cavity through both of  my lungs did you think that was it because it's right in your you know right when something like

[02:12:30]  guys doing sheriff colin you can't do that i'm sitting right here that's that's furious manager  that's a big look how that is a big son of a bitch you might be called the new trace he is  so i met him yesterday he's taller than me here's guys very rock and roll acdc for those about to  rock right on his fucking chest baby what's up guy yeah see you buddy you know trace i just met him  the other day god is he tall yeah he's tall man yeah your manager is pretty goddamn but he's not 
[02:13:00]  rocking a cowboy hat and boots yeah he's in nikes and a golf shirt yeah yeah yeah no i saw him we met  the other day and uh what a what a great guy and you've been you hit the tour man you've been all  over well you know that's what they make you do when you have a new album come out they make you go  dance for granny the girls the girls are going nuts at that show all right like hey i'm here i'm  cooking i'm making some food you were cooking at one of his shows i should have been cooking  we were doing uh one of the morning shows oh okay good time so we were standing out there 
[02:13:30]  grilling and talking about food and the whole thing and he's from louisiana we were talking about  where we were talking about that you got to respect the guy that's got his own line of cutlery  yeah yeah yeah we were just looking at that knuckle sandwich knives yeah great names on him big  sharp blade i call great name for his knives yes indeed god you remember we met austin texas really  colin quinn colin makes the face like nah you recognize me he's in texas he's so proud of himself 
[02:14:00]  that he remembered something did you see that that look on his face that was awesome he had a senior  moment he's like i remembered something come on i know exactly what in the magnolia bakery treats guy  you also switched uh spots for tom papa yeah tom i think tom felt a little like you know tom should be  on the couch quite frankly no idea i was like colin queen was to be up here but guy and i go way  back also i want an expert opinion tom you try some of that ice cream man i don't care if y'all tried 
[02:14:30]  i want him to try exactly yeah guys try the uh maple he's the expert what is this called moonshine mashup  see i tell you if there would have been a little moonshine in this i think these are great  well we know yo the mad cubans in here too no you're not that cuban we love them you're the one  one introduced us to him and now he does our show mapley it has a butterscotch-y taste to it  it's very good and it's good and it it's pretty good yeah i hope you should try something shut the 
[02:15:00]  front door you know and i i just thought you know pen he did uh he went way out there and mixed vanilla  and chocolate did you just call him out of that i think so i did a maple macadamia which my my young  lady uh they called her an ice cream wizard she said that uh as far as she knew that hadn't been  done so i'll tell you i had pens yesterday and i he's got salt in his he's got a sea salt salt and 
[02:15:30]  the the counterbalance to the sugar i mean it really plays nicely and they had big chunks of chocolate  in it kind of a bittersweet chocolate but i'm not a huge chocolate guy oh this right here reminds me of  like pralines and cream that macadamia that survives in there a lot of time the nuts kind of get you know  they kind of get crushed and they're a little soft and they don't have any texture this has great  texture it's not overly sweet you think maple and i'm like oh boy someone's going to go crazy with  the mrs butterworth but this is this got a good balance man you're she kept coming to me and i 
[02:16:00]  would say and i would say come on give me some more maple and she kept cranking up the maple intensity i  thought i might may have gone a little too far with it you think it's all right it's almost too much  can you ship can you ship this to people's houses i mean can you only buy dwayne reed and  walgreens yeah is it only in new york they carry it no it's everywhere i'm nationwide dude national  right nationwide yeah nationwide god damn is that a great song uh tell us about the new album that's 
[02:16:30]  uh that's coming out i did a new i got a new album out it's uh called love will and it's  it's just nothing but love songs i've never done that before yeah love will dot dot dot  there you go thank you guy guy knows the first time i'd ever done that we just started playing  your songs yesterday and i didn't set out to do it really yeah i thought i had the album done  in august and then this apprentice thing came up and i whored out and went and did that  so i couldn't so i couldn't come out in the fall with the album like i thought i was going to so we 
[02:17:00]  had to delay the release of it and in the meantime i i came up with a few more songs and i recorded  them and then i realized that i had 11 love songs i had about 18 19 songs cut and uh i thought wow  11 of these are love songs so i'm just going to put out an album of love songs but it's not like a  bread album i mean don't think that it's that because you got to keep in mind i'm i'm the guy that  thinks badonkadonk is a love song right yes you know keep yeah so but i will say this this album 
[02:17:30]  is a deal closer you know if you've got and she's not cooperating and spend an evening with her put  this album on and close it sounds like fast times at ridgebound or let her go yeah must have been  somebody's baby jennifer jason lee's getting plowed again every time that god damn song  so what did anything change in your life where you're like i love songs let me jot a few of these 
[02:18:00]  down no you know i don't not not consciously i don't uh but maybe there's something going on you  know i think i don't want to get all into that stuff man but i suppose there's a time in a man's  life when he starts staring mortality in the face and you know and you start realizing what was that  for you like 10 based on your bio holy no i always thought i was indestructible now yeah i kind of  know that i'm not so yeah that kind of sucks shot in the heart does that reach that yeah man who said 
[02:18:30]  that oh the couch i'm over on the couch i can't even see him at the kid table i couldn't stand to see  colin quinn after watching his show last night you could stop writing on the couch i couldn't  stand i can't have the legend be on the couch you should have seen when the mark cuban and bill  burr was in the air sitting on that couch it was ridiculous you were just being pounded that was  terrible and uh now you're just name dropping mark cuban wow if i had a fucking desert eagle

[02:20:30]  i'm like what are you wow i mean they've got like rv they're doing more locations than i am and then  they're bringing me portfolios of other places i should try i'm like no no get ahead of the wave  i mean just let me let me go at my own hey you know we're doing this uh this fall we're taking a  bus trip a tour bus from here from new york down to where we end up branson missouri  but we're going through branson that's right we we have to check out even though i think  yakov's not going to be there but you check out the barry williams 70s long explosion it's a long  story was there yakov smirnoff reference in there i think yakov that's why we're going 
[02:21:00]  seriously did i just hear yakov smirnoff that's why we're going i saw him in venus when i was in  college trace is just shaking his head hey guy i want to ask you something yes sir uh you know the  magazines on airplanes and they've got the list of the ten best steakhouses in america you know  what i'm saying okay but those people pay do these people pay you to be in this book no but jeez you  started getting wwf on me just started pushing me i'm going to ask you a question all right let me 
[02:21:30]  listen to me brother i'm gonna break it down all right brother did you see how he turned  no yes yes maybe i don't know i don't think i caught it i kind of like seeing somebody  fucking alpha male in your ass uh i'm telling you just that you saw me right in his face  he's like let me ask you something yeah yeah he's suspended  he turned around right in your face man i'll suss you i'll hook that i'll hook this sus in your nose  you're in deep trouble my friend no we don't we don't take any uh 
[02:22:00]  suss hook you man we don't take any bribes as far as you know you're good  shit quinn  i never even thought of that i'm gonna suss hook you boy  all i know is he's got his pinky curled up like he's gonna gas somebody in the nose with it  i might have missed that piece yeah we're  we're we're we're going with uh trace to win celebrity apprentice i might i'd have to do 
[02:22:30]  that's a french part i don't know boy we are really  by the way i want to hear about this this  so we're going to be stopping in a few places you know anywhere where was a good place  along the way give us give us an example i will set up you guys just give me the itinerary  i will set up nice and we'll weigh you at the beginning of the event like mccluskey and then  we'll weigh you at branson we'll put three of those branson missouri buffets under your belt 
[02:23:00]  you know i hear yakov's place at yakov's dinner adventure what happens is he gives you a a real  middle metal tray that has a magnet on the back and it sticks on the seat because when you watch  yakov's dinner theater it's in movie theater seats you're literally sitting in movie theater seats  so they have magnets on the arm you click your metal tray but don't get discouraged genuine linen  napkins real silverware now you get a spork i know you get a spork real this is what they actually  pitch their advertising shit that they they have real linen napkins real silverware and um uh a chicken 
[02:23:30]  which i'm sure is just being pumped out of there like like the chocolate on that lucy conveyor belt  yeah you're going old school with that yeah  jerry's jubilee jubilee right i want to bake the last year we are uh very excited about that so  how long will the trip take a week about a week we're just going to do memphis  nashville oh we got some good i got some good we're going austin i got great austin great food 
[02:24:00]  memphis great food national great food i got a barbecue joint right outside right outside of  than that can we just walk in and go caffieri sent us rock and roll yeah and we're going to  try to set it up to that degree like case and shit no i'm not this would be good stuff how many  people in your crew and what's your possibly going to look like like winnebago hey is this  going to be like not including the broads that we're going to get on the bus the broads oh boy  yeah because you know they're asleep by 9 30 at night it doesn't look like you ever see that 
[02:24:30]  see this type of the gas station and one flew over the cooper's neck  that's my right they're going to look like convoy you know with all these dilapidated rigs  behind you yeah it's going to be pretty people flashing you when they drive by the bus maybe a  couple of cbs so we could talk to each other that'd be nice yeah old school be a nice touch buddy i was  the wrangler bring the hardware that's right what you're gonna bring the hardware i don't think i  could bring my piece why not yeah you cross state lines everything's not smoky in the bandit you  can't do that i had one on the bus one time i forgot about it was in my nightstand by my bed and then we 
[02:25:00]  crossed the border going into canada and they put me in jail oh they did lock you up yeah they locked  me up for six hours you know they locked me up for about six hours how do they come on and handcuff  you is what i want to know no shit well all right get on there and get him no i i copped to it  immediately because i it was like border crossing trainee day and so they were just like going  through everything so i immediately said okay wait i forgot about something and then i told them  where it was and then they just shouldn't they take things like that into consideration and and know 
[02:25:30]  that it's like look it's trace adkins he's not gonna fucking be blasting off in canada with this  gun it was an honest mistake you know as opposed to somebody you know is trying to commit some kind  of real climate it was uh it was weird and then when they gave me my pistol it was a little 380  automatic wasn't a big deal but they handed it back to me and they had completely disassembled  it so it was just all in pieces kept souvenir and i had to walk i had to walk back across the border 
[02:26:00]  and mail at home they wouldn't let me drive back across wow wow that's so now do you have a weapons  charge on you in canada or something uh no but that's why they really got mad because i had a  weapons charge here and oh oh boy i like the fact that every question trace answers it's like  another story really this leads to another whole story box just yeah i love it we were shipping the uh  the camaro we used for triple d across the border and i just been at a uh just was a kid rock's place 
[02:26:30]  doing a shoot for oh god and we and we loaded it up we loaded it up oh you don't like the beer you  don't like rock found guns and dope and women in the trunk of the car so we loaded up he makes this  great beer he makes this great beer we had on the show and i wanted to take some back to california so  i threw it in the trunk of my camaro well i just happened to forget the camaro was on its way to  canada so i get a call from this driver stressing out there is here there's beer in the back of your car  where the hell did that come from yeah i don't know yeah but they actually they let it go they 
[02:27:00]  let the car come into canada cruise around with the 10 cases and cruise back out oh okay did they  know no weapons charge no weapons yeah you gotta watch that i hate the fact that you know you go  from one state to another and you're fucking your gun's good here it's not good here you're responsible  and we trust you and you went through all the hoops here like in new york you gotta go through so much  i should be able to cover every goddamn state in the union but uh you know i can't drive across jersey  uh unless it's in a locked box separate from the ammo you're not stopping until you get to 
[02:27:30]  pennsylvania you know shit like that which is really stupid because then if someone steals the car  instead of the gun being on you where you have possession of it and know where it is and it's not  going to get in anyone else's hands now someone's got your gun and your car it the laws make no  sense they they punish the law-abiding citizen do nothing to make anyone safer where is this coming  from i've never heard you talk like this exactly do you know what a new yorker just got arrested  a new yorker just got arrested because of the new law that only allows seven rounds in your magazine 
[02:28:00]  um and uh he had ten because he had a ten-round right right right and he got pulled over he had  this one to see the state he pulled him over and uh looked uh saw the gun the guy says yes i completely  legal i got this the trooper checked the magazine found that there were you know three more too many  bullets or two i think it was a nine-round maggie they had so there's only two extra bullets and  arrested him and now the guy's got a weapons charge on him because of that how did that make  anyone any safer how did that law just make new york a safer place to live because a guy that legally 
[02:28:30]  owns a gun has all the permit had two bullets too many in his magazine the laws are ridiculous talk  you boy cuomo yeah well he's one of the gun charge i had was a similar kind of thing it wasn't i wasn't  doing anything illegal you know how did i had a pistol and it was in the in the in my boot pocket  of the door of my truck uh-huh and at the time i didn't have a permit carry permit but anyway so 
[02:29:00]  the pistol was there in the door and and it was loaded of course and i got pulled over for something  else and the guy looks and he goes is that gun loaded and i said is your gun loaded yes you know  yeah me i carried a paperweight there are two useless things in this world a dull knife and an  empty gun you know um so he said assume the position and took me directly to jail but that's  my gun charge i mean i didn't you know i didn't like what state what state was that that was tennessee 
[02:29:30]  tennessee wow i think now i have a carry permit to see in tennessee you know so they're all cool  with if you hook up like fucking ted nugent they like deputize him and he could carry anywhere in the in  the country a bazooka you got to get that the fact that trace doesn't think he's getting arrested  he's like hey officer there's two useless things in this world a dull knife and an unloaded gun  instead of going it's loaded sir but i'm on my way  what did you tell him hey fuck you you're not gonna do nothing about it 
[02:30:00]  no he did he asked me he says that gun loaded sir and i said hell is your gun loaded you know i mean  come on man yeah it's loaded absolutely why wouldn't you have six steps out of what i look  like i'm in a liberace movie hey i got i got i got i got caught stealing bubble yum once  and they put me in the back my dad had to come get me wow that is frightening  trace has lived uh the life here man the whole the the work ethic they're getting hurt on a real man's 
[02:30:30]  job right the country music star weapons charges jesus christ it's fantastic are we going to tell  pendulet that we're not rooting for him anymore i know i told him i'm all about i'm all in with trace  now and and this is fantastic yeah look it's trying now it's a little mushy say it's wonderful  we probably should take a break you know what get trace i gotta go anyway this would be good on  this would be great on i gotta go to atlantic city and hang out with my peeps atlantic city where do you 
[02:31:00]  stay when you go there i don't stay anywhere there i go i go there and they give me money and i  leave oh okay yeah i gotta go do a show tonight at caesar's there caesar's in a c can we play one of  your new songs that'd be cool i didn't come over here no i'm gonna do it though he throws a smack  down no matter what he says you're gonna you're that close to getting punched in the face he is  very intimidating guy authentic say no to a woman or watch the world then uh say no to a woman all

[02:38:00]  bringing to you all the great moments that have happened on the open anthony show in 2013 and  we're only in july this is the worst of 2013 so far with me sam roberts while open anthony are on  vacation this week we're looking at the year that was before it's the year that was courtney love was  in studio a few months ago uh we didn't know what to expect from miss courtney she's she's a little 
[02:38:30]  unpredictable okay uh yes she's had a rich history in rock and roll and she's got a lot to talk about  but she's also known for possibly being nuts uh being difficult we don't know if she's going to be  a good interview or not so what do we do we take a chance on it we see what happens and what do we get  one of the greatest interviews of this year maybe of all time courtney love she gives us all kinds of  dish about the rock industry anthony kiedis dave growl everything you ever wanted to know it's 
[02:39:00]  courtney love on the worst of 2013 so far on a's worst of 2013 so far what do you think of amanda  binds you tweeted her right oh yeah that thing um i think she likes the word ugly a lot yeah she is  that for everybody it's like what's that about listen i was 14 i was so bloody ugly and i thought it  it was kate moss i chased this guy named mark rennie he was the hottest photographer in portland 
[02:39:30]  around convinced him i gotta show you guys these pictures they're so ugly um you know i had this big  schnoz and i had like blusher on like this and i'm good i'm wearing white gloves and black and white  thing and i'm like this like making new wave faces oh nice voguing and i am so fucking homely and i think  i'm in a gap in my teeth and i thought it was the hottest thing in the world and i was 180 pounds  wow so if someone calls me ugly it sort of rolls off my back because like it's not about looks it's 
[02:40:00]  about attitude i mean you get laid on attitude that's but then you think that was kind of shitty  because you kind of like you didn't say anything bad to her what i said back to you is you misunderstood  me and well your tweet was get it together dude i think the first one like that get it together  dude because you're so crazy yeah yeah of course wig and this and that oh yeah and and marijuana isn't a  drug come on and clearly marijuana is a drug um least other drugs and then there's then there's  this whole thing about like disney kids just like they're not educated look at how she writes um you 
[02:40:30]  know i'm not educated either but i'm at least autodidactic at least i try and read flapper  do you know what i mean pronounce it correctly um and um they're they have no parental infrastructure  and they just get like after they're not nubile anymore or useful they're sort of waylaid they  just lose it yeah and then we all pick on them she come up and enjoy it well we love a train wreck  yeah who doesn't love a train model your thing on lohan man like right yeah and we do look at it 
[02:41:00]  until something tragic happens and then everybody's like oh you know she should have had help and this  but meanwhile everyone was piling on the dog pile like that you know i did the billboard awards once  and i refused to lip sync and it was a huge mistake oh really yeah because there's like this little  delay and because i thought it was just i can't say i thought it was gay yeah yeah homosexual fans  i love you i think you're home sometimes okay um i thought it was just lame and um we actually 
[02:41:30]  sounded worse wow doing accu tuning back then and whatever and i think kid rock said something  on the billboard awards about people that lip sync but he's got a lip sync we all lip sync now yeah  on those shows you have to sound like shit oh man that's kind of why does it sound like like  shit why can't they get that sound like do a sound check early in the day yeah i don't know  it does suck you ever hear the chili peppers without anthony's voice accutuned oh 
[02:42:00]  not going there sorry well you know accutune is something they do live is that no no no they can  do it live but it it's where if you're hitting flats and sharps they can it rounds it up to where  it's supposed to be yeah it's where it's supposed to be it's uh but they did with mary j blige's  voice in my opinion mary j blige had this fantastic phenomenal soulful wounded great voice and lately  what i hear is really accutuned yeah it's like barbie it's like where are you and have you used 
[02:42:30]  that um for me yeah hell yeah yeah i'm white you know i don't hear  you're not going to do that but the live shows you do you it's all it's all real you don't use  yeah of course but anthony kiedis doesn't sound great live huh if you take that away without  insulting one of my oldest friends who let me use his rehearsal space before i even had a band 
[02:43:00]  therefore i wouldn't even be here without flea that anthony's voice is slightly banal  without a little something something like reverb well when they first started he wasn't even  on key a lot of the times that was kind of the way the music was written too and then later on  they got very popular it was a more of a uh pop thing and it needed to be yeah on key and everything  right yeah he was very loose with his being either flat or sharp with a lot of things there was like 
[02:43:30]  something that was there was like a lack of personality for a while yeah yeah yeah yeah and when  you're in studios you hear people's voices naked uh-huh which i mean you hear your own voice naked it's  embarrassing enough but when hearing other people's voices naked it's like taking a look at them  showering yeah i think that's why you can never like tattling on it isn't really cool you can never  really get the the impact of what people are going to hear on a record yeah you can't really tell what 
[02:44:00]  people are going to hear on a record because you hear it as you're singing it and you hear just bear  through the cans and every time you listen to that song even through when they're processing it unless  you're in love with yourself you can't well yeah but who is i am are you really what happened with  you and eric he took 74 guitars from my storage 18 of them were curts they're left-handed and then  when he gets he needs money he sell he has sold um like kurt went to england and got all these marshall 
[02:44:30]  stacks like seven out of ten marshalls are lemons so for a guy with perfect pitch like kurt you know and  mico who's in my band now going to the marshall factory and getting the non-lemons it's a big  thing you don't give a shit i don't have perfect pitch me and anthony you know so anyway uh they  say hole on one side nirvana on the other side and he sold them oh and then he sold like a headstock  that kurt had broke for like a hundred grand and you know it's like there's this guy bc who collects 
[02:45:00]  stuff and he's a bit gross like he collects like syringes he collects pill bottles like cool paul  allen also has 45 000 plus items that came that are like basically the contents of me and francis  and kurt's entire home and that's a long story and i don't want to make allegations against paul allen  on your radio show because he's got more lawyers than i do oh boy oh boy but um wait but how would 
[02:45:30]  you get that stuff i gotta ask you well i can tell you but then the lawyers would go i'd have a  lawyer because that's a lot potentially walked out potentially a lot of money there obviously and  yeah and the less i talk about it probably the more um discreetly and it will be to get that  out of there but you gotta be out of your mind about it obviously um i'm pissed i'm pissed that mostly  i'm pissed that the guitar tech who was really sweet and nice um we found out that he has 16 so 
[02:46:00]  there's 38 kurt there's only 38 kurt guitars in the world and he has so eric has 17 we have 12 and  then ernie has the remaining x amount in a storage space in washington that he loans out to paul allen's  museum and it's a matter and he did a uh deposition in canada they got no press and it's really a matter  of finding out um proving that paul's sister jody knew about it because jody allen kind of put it 
[02:46:30]  together if she didn't know about it she didn't know about it but um how did you how is it like  it's like it's almost like in a holocaust when they stole paintings and sold them right they were  they were eventually returned family the emp music project did their family they came to my house  and this guy peter blackett well he's the curator there he showed me pictures of things like i said  needles spoons pill bottles you know things you don't want on display and asked me in and i 
[02:47:00]  answered the door this is 1998 so he died in 94 so this is four years later and i answered the door  in his long jaws chris long jaws he goes oh you're wearing artifacts i'm like no i'm wearing my dead  husband oh my god like what and then he wanted a bunch of stuff and i figured paul is really rich  i'm like okay give me a foundation i'll give you some stuff and they weren't playing ball and then i  put everything in storage with my name on it so it said courtney love which is like a big 
[02:47:30]  fucking red flag and then sometime in 03 the name got changed to a corporate name and it went in arrears  after 90 days and they did an auction a public auction oh my god but there's a good part to it  which is somebody was so stupid they left their real name uh-huh so were they saying you weren't  paying your your monthly storage bill yeah they changed it to a corporate name and what was the  monthly storage bill like what was it was a couple hundred bucks a month a month and uh and so for  that they they they changed so the the this this whoever this person is paid something like 1500 bucks 
[02:48:00]  for 18 holds wow and got everything and francis asked me recently for this chair of her dad's and  i'm like i don't have it oof it's a experienced music project so i don't see that on story we'll see how  that goes okay well it's amazing how they like bobby fisher the chess player he had his he had 
[02:48:30]  stuff in storage valuable stuff yeah and somehow somebody else got a hold of it and it was like  it's your personal they put your name into a corporation they go three months without paying  it then they put a little teeny ad in like bethlem pennsylvania it says you are going to have a sale or  you know acme llc woodside 944 is having a sale because that way your name's not on it so nobody  comes so no one knows what's what they're selling only one person uh a sale i understand i understand 
[02:49:00]  wow and they take it all back that's sleazy man who has it was in anaheim california who has the lead  belly guitar you mean the nixon now wasn't didn't kurt get a lead belly guitar he did have one i don't  know where it is or any of my habit um the last guitar i played uh on unplugged francis wants so  she wants to keep that who has that that's an art pack i have that oh you have that who lives in  the old house what old house in seattle yeah this uh microsoft lady who doesn't win the little kids 
[02:49:30]  that come next door for their pilgrimage just oh really yeah yeah it's a really waspy neighborhood  too that's where howard schultz starbucks guy had a uh he pulled a 1901 easement on me so i couldn't  build a driveway because the city of seattle picked on him and then he charged the city of seattle with  anti-semitism hired rogers and cowen wow and we our kids his kid was the same as his franny and he  wouldn't let her play with him which i thought was snotty and he had built his driveway like seriously 
[02:50:00]  two inches onto the thing veretta park but it's so waspy and it really is an anti-semitic  town really if you don't like jews you don't like show people that's a rule so i remember going  into this meeting it's all these wasps and it was the friends of veretta park and if you look  at pictures of that thing i mean every day they have to take the you know every whatever month  they have to take the bench down because people write shit on the bench because his ashes aren't  anywhere because no graveyard in washington that's in the willamette valley will take his ashes why 
[02:50:30]  that doesn't sound right it's a felony in washington it's actually in some states it's  considered mental illness right but in washington state for insurance reasons because lobbies tend  to make a lot of laws right um suicide is a very it's very high it's very high by men with guns  and so the insurance lobbies made it into a felony so you can't so there's no life insurance  no life insurance you got it that's it so where the ashes it took me by the way um i have a lot 
[02:51:00]  of them oh you split them up a little bit i split them up with his mom yeah and and so she has them  in this tibetan stupa and then there's some under a willow tree that we don't know what to do with  the bloody willow tree though because she's moving out of that house oh sure so i don't want to give it  to paul allen and so we straighten this little mess out so how to dig up the willow tree and bring  it put where i don't know central park do that it's hard to carry a willow tree yeah back of the 
[02:51:30]  willow trees are really delicate i'll take it no you have an arboretum guy like be very very delicate  i understand but if you're going to leave it there i'll uh we'll take it leave it there all right  it's got a beautiful house you want the willow tree i don't think i could do the willow tree  like a public willow tree i think you're right but i don't know i don't want to do that yoko  strawberry fields yeah yeah right right it's not really me yeah strawberry fields is kind of 
[02:52:00]  protect you want it to be somewhere public that can be watched because somebody will take it yeah  that's why i thought of paul allen because he sort of owns um what's he saying oh i don't know now i i  want to make sure that this whole experience music project which is that museum thing is clean  and that my stuff isn't there right so in order to do that there needs to be dialogue and there's  like between lawyers and as shakespeare said first thing we do let's kill all the lawyers one other 
[02:52:30]  question because i think you got to go yeah where are you at with dave growl these days i don't know  you guys cool pat smear yeah um a little while ago and um but two weeks ago um pat was the only person  in l.a that could not drive and he was also really happy and when kurt wanted somebody in  his band that was happy he wasn't that great a guitar player but he was fucking happy so i know  he's got it's really really happy and he was working for minimum wage at the ssc superstore with 
[02:53:00]  my first husband falling james and falling james said to him if you join that band you're selling out  wow no kidding yeah this guy was a tranny that i married in las vegas it's an annulment  whole backstory thing it's in my wiki who knew we had so much in common  we all do it right of course corny jim isn't the tranny so that's really i married a tranny in las  vegas oh wow no i came back to the club lingerie peppers were there l7 was there um gun club guys 
[02:53:30]  were there i said i just married fallen james and no one laughed now these people aren't laughing  uh-oh i did something bad oh right right right and then i didn't have a money for a lawyer for  like a year so it took me a year to get an old he was really into pantyhose yeah of course so when  kurt called pat at the ssc superstore falling james is there he's like if you join nirvana you're  selling out so pat to this day is in the food fighters and he said you know every time this  shit comes up dave says i have nothing to do with it he goes you know have you ever thought that it 
[02:54:00]  could just be the lawyers and that actually is food for thought but when i went on howard and i  said many years ago i said i'll have lunch with him he went on howard and he was like you know  basically fuck her so it's not a yoko thing about us what it is is it's not even a dislike thing on my  end it's that first of all i had absolutely no awareness of how big they were until a few months  ago when i bought my guitar player telecaster looked up a guitar center and saw what i thought 
[02:54:30]  was the super bowl it was a food fighter show holy fuck they're big you had no idea they're huge arenas  we all know that yeah big arenas but how did it take you so long to know that the point the point is  is that there's a financial issue with like money market accounts pension plans  under something called nirvana inc that doesn't include francis and i need to get to the bottom of  what that is and maybe it's just lawyers because lawyers are hacks with awful people in rock and roll 
[02:55:00]  so you know but i'm so sick of lawyers i just want to play rock tv has never been my thing particularly  what we call reality tv or whatever and this isn't like some e-channel courtney's life thing what tv  show is it i can't tell you oh man because it's a network thing so it's a big thing is it something  that's already on or is it brand new no it's right now oh oh maybe maybe like you know american  idol uh i can't i just can't judge or something i just can't say a judge on american idol wow you're 
[02:55:30]  gonna be on american idol that's great that's a great gig i did not say that i didn't i didn't  that's a great gig wow we got a scoop today this show is looking for yeah i read the demographic  thing they're looking for is disaffected i love that word oh disaffected females and homosexuals  and therefore there is only one person to call that would be me wait so what show the voice 
[02:56:00]  yeah it could be american idol yeah that is true yeah what happened to my mic that's on it's on no  you muted me no you're silencing me no is it are your headphones you're silencing your headphones with  your name who's opie and who's anthony opie anthony so american idol that's a great gig i did not  say see that or the voice i'm saying yeah i wanted yeah okay i couldn't get on the voice if you pay i  mean that's the voice but she's not saying no it's american i'm not saying anything american  island they're not they're knocking everybody out what's the dance show to uh dance with the stars 
[02:56:30]  because you know oh because my because i'm sorry my pole work gives me so much you know i enjoyed  that greatly that you just did that capacity that did you have the goods uh covered up very covered  up all right they're covered up yeah yeah with a thin strip with a very thin strip a very thin  yeah that was a hit she's not denying american idol they're getting rid of everybody they really  are that'd be a great gig that would be a good one they like someone that's outspoken  a little outrageous yeah they like that on the show yeah yeah perfect for that show you'd be 
[02:57:00]  honest yep she's not saying a word  rumor has it that's how it starts it's been too soft because nobody's been honest on that show for a  while yeah and you need that don't you think like like badass is supposed to go on there and be  badasses and then they go on there it's butterflies flying out their asses it's like yeah come on yeah  you know like he was nice they were overly nice well your buddy there uh howard he he uh is a bit 
[02:57:30]  soft on some of the acts i guess you can't just wheel in there and go like yeah you can't just go in  there though and be like he just had a total grace kelly to you know he had a totally non-controversial  fantastic yeah discussion yeah i hope i get invited back so you think that on the show you'll be  more outrageous and you'll speak the truth if someone's bad on american idol yeah what show it  was you know i'm not saying just saying whatever show it is whatever show you're judging speak the 
[02:58:00]  truth right so if someone's lip-syncing or all that stuff you're gonna you know i did the billboard  awards once and i refused to lip-sync and it was a huge mistake and i'm sorry about our  misunderstanding about shock jocks nothing no it was nothing it wasn't shocking we barely even  mentioned it wasn't shocking at all right that we didn't yeah we weren't bothered by it we just  want to get to the bottom of it that's all we were cool all the time look we're just happy  american idol that's freaking awesome that's congratulations on the american

[03:11:30]  but i don't want to get up like that man that's the whole point of there's nothing to do with his  love for stand-up comedy he just doesn't want to get up in the morning that's a big part of my love  is stand-up comedy you do it just after a while that's what patrice said to me once he goes i worked  he goes because when i first moved to new york i still had that i should be getting up and working  i that was the first time i ever i quit all my jobs yeah i was just doing stand-up when i moved  to new york other than that when i was in boston at five jobs and i for the first year i'd be feel 
[03:12:00]  guilty around three o'clock i'd be like fuck dude i should be doing something he's like dude i worked  seven years to be fucking lazy right go back to bed you piece of shit and i was like oh i get it  all right i gotta switch this up a little bit there's a oh there's something that happened  this week yes that uh with kurt yes i thought that's why i was here to begin with well well  no you're here because i wanted you to be on the show we need to balance the funny this one fucking  blows me away about this fucking part why do you need a reason to be here why do you have a podcast 
[03:12:30]  because i have friends of mine on and we shoot the shit and have fun you fucking beautiful frat studio  we had at the beginning i mean are you having fun he's better in print i haven't yeah oh he's got  me nailed yeah we should have wrong with that we should have just blogged this whole show he gets me  um i didn't i had you on because you're a friend of mine and i've known you for years and  you know i had dylan on last week and i felt bad when i saw your face bobby can i try something for 
[03:13:00]  you have him ask a question to you well i want to set this up because what happened this week and  oh he's going to be involved with the kurt he's going to be wrong i wrote something about this  today yeah so what happened so why don't you explain what happened you'll explain it a little  better sean go ahead explain what's going on with ucb and what kurt did and what's happening  yeah i like him explains i want to know i i didn't have in my head what it is but i'm like i wonder  what the rest of the world yeah kurt's a lunatic yeah well well this is just this is just the 
[03:13:30]  the new iteration of a debate that's been going on for years first of all dumb it down already  iteration not my fan base go i knew what it was it's okay well bobby i don't know if you remember  10 years ago there was an issue with comics getting paid even at the showcase clubs like here at the  cellar or carolines or gotham yes i do and there was a big to-do there were petitions made people  want to get enough money right well it was ted alexandro there's russman eve and buddy bolton and buddy  bolton well yeah but here's the thing though is that all the comics all the clubs in the city 
[03:14:00]  paid 50 for the last 30 fucking years right so we didn't get a raise they made more money  there was more clubs there was more comics everybody was getting money except us yep so it  was like fuck this and then some clubs actually stepped up and some clubs didn't so we had to all  come together yeah have meetings and and we got convoluted huh uh when open micers were that there 
[03:14:30]  was more open micers at the meeting than fucking headline like working comics and they were like  well what about us well fuck you what about you we were you don't you have to pay your dues right  you don't get paid we're the ones that get paid so that when you move up you have something to look  forward to you know what i mean you you have something goals to get i want to be a paid guy  i want to get a food spot i want to get weekends remember those yeah so what happened we all got  together and we changed the way new york city and i think it was the first time it's ever been done 
[03:15:00]  here where everybody upped their money yeah and uh it went to 65 so some of these guys try to fuck  tay 75 buddy they try to go well some blackball them i don't know if you want to name names but some  dudes did that shit some people did yeah some people well all right whatever i'm not gonna  force you to do it i didn't know that yeah dude so who i mean you could guess try to take a wild  guess all right take a wild guess he would do something like al martin yeah the bringer yeah 
[03:15:30]  okay so so those guys but they most of the clubs though accepted them right and understood and blew  over quick and we got our money everybody and everybody got paid even the fucking new people even  the newcomers got 20 at least 20 a spot right and during the week it was 20 a spot 25 from like  15 right so the new issue is over the course of the last few years nice segue by the way there have  been these other venues you don't call them alt rooms or indie rooms you just call them these other  independent venues right such as the upright citizen brigade theater or the pit these other rooms places 
[03:16:00]  in brooklyn they're not full-time comedy clubs they're not theaters but they are charging they're trying  to charge lower fees for ticket prices right right and in exchange for having a lower ticket price  they're saying well we're not going to pay the performance we'll just cut it out of your end  to have the ticket price it's a fucking amazing they're having like the old arguments that some  of these club owners have which is like we can't afford to possibly pay the reason that we have the 
[03:16:30]  fucking business but it's it's sold out shows it was one show i complain about one show okay tell me  what you complained about they had one show called if you build it that i did this girl cara clank runs  it that uh i used to work with her in the video game award so it's her room at ucb east okay okay  the show's friday night can i just stop you real quick they were so successful with ucb right they  actually opened up another club that's right all right so if you're not successful if you're not  making money right you don't open up an east club yeah but same but let me interject the business model 
[03:17:00]  isn't so much that they have successful shows the business models that they charge improv actors a  fee to come and learn improv at their school i'm saying they're six i'm not saying the show i'm  saying they're successful at what they do correct right they know what they're doing i don't know  what i found out i talked to the dude matt bezzer from ecb at one point so what happened you just  tell me what happened with you so i was doing i don't even look at those don't even look those  aren't for you i did the show whatever was pictures of my wife's vagina he was just like  well at least someone's looking at it my wife's vagina looks like patrice my god 
[03:17:30]  so i did this show a couple times i noticed it was uh friday night because and i just assumed i  was getting paid right because it's packed it was 120 cp she didn't clarify that before  how much did you take it ten dollars a ticket which is not high never told you that you were  getting paid before she's just ashamed oh no all these fucking people because because it's 10  years since the coalition so all these new fucking comics are such low self-esteem fucking illegal  immigrants they just lewis well not even i mean lewis is getting i'm kidding puerto rico is part of 
[03:18:00]  it it's a commonwealth thank you very much you know what i'm back on sean's side but uh but so i would  do the show and then like on top of that the people that would run ucb it's like the were kind of  like dicks like they had these little rules like the college couldn't use their drink ticket until after  they perform what yeah this guy nick turner if you look on my facebook put a whole story that  some guy poured his beer out because he goes you can't have this now before the show and nick was  like i gotta get out of here because i've got another spot to make and the guy poured it out in  front of him instead of just giving him i mean i would i would just and i really don't think i can 
[03:18:30]  fight but i would just just so for the story just beat the daylights out of improv for doing that  like just to say that i did it i would do that like i would have said give me two things that piss you  off wait what that was a joke give him the fucking bomb bandana please right now i was i thought i  got i thought that was good i didn't you should have it was an improv joke better words it was an  improv joke it was give me two things that piss you off it's it was uh so so anyway so i just  initially that wasn't on there good i actually threw you off track it's shorted out my story though 
[03:19:00]  it's called blocking so there's like a month i don't know how many months ago i posed this thing  like first i just posted one anchor was like i'd love to meet whoever came up with this shit or  something that sounds like kind of threatening he said i want to meet the um manager of ucb east  right now no i didn't say that i mean that's not the exact word i said i loved it it's not those uh  anyway bring it up he's right here kelly then i did the show he can actually tell us what he  actually fucking said i was the point of argument stupid aussie so that was the initial thing 
[03:19:30]  and then i got like some people were like hurry up oh he's fading he's past his bedtime so i did  another show i did another show there well don't interrupt me and i'll tell you the goddamn story  sorry guys so i go i go do this fucking other show and i made fun of uh i made fun of this on stage  at ucb and i see the light going well i'm talking shit it wasn't even mean like the crowd was laughing  right but uh it was this guy michael shawky had a show there right right and uh so supposedly they  threw his whole show out of the lineup because because i was talking to shit they deny that they deny 
[03:20:00]  that too who's they can you give me a couple names i don't know any of the fucking names these people  i don't know any of their fucking improv names are they black it's improv you think that they're  black you think that's a sorry a black man i'm sorry they're black people improv by the black  improv is yeah but not like they're not good at it yeah they got they got like when it was on  and shit trust me they got some fucking hannibal glasses and chuck taylor's if they're doing it yeah  you're gonna you're gonna add an e if it's black it's a white man's get it like fucking scam because 
[03:20:30]  you got to charge kids that are having the rent paid for them you know so so these people  they're like this shit so so i complain about this right so they took they said fuck they not only  were mad at you they took this guy's show and said go fuck yourself anything to me but to him  yeah and so officially that's not the reason they did but supposedly the tech guy who was the guy  lighting me right like you're not controlling your comics so so i found out about my i'm sorry we have  to be controlled now that's not their official policy according to matt besser and a lot of this 
[03:21:00]  shit is not their policy it's the people working there that is how this so there's creole there's  controlled creativity that's how it works the people that are the employees are fucking uh they're  performers you know they don't pay a staff to run the shit it's people that want to be on stage  for nothing so of course they hate your guts as a comic coming in like oh this guy doesn't have  to clean up popcorn after the show i'm like no bitch i'm not a fucking bitch improver  first of all i started out in improv me dane cook aldo benny and jay hall alan the monkeys 
[03:21:30]  okay we're boston's best fucking improv group i believe that i believe that 100 you've never  seen me do hands improv well awesome look i'm just talking about that give me three things to pitch  go ahead oh i get that baby i get the joke now i get it all right so so anyway i had another show  that nobody said anything to me right they were mad at the next time i did this if you build it show  which is the packed one right okay and this is the only show i think was supposed to pay like 
[03:22:00]  they have a bunch of shows i'll do for free because they're not taking money at the door you  know whiplash is a good show i don't give a shit like love whiplash yeah it's a great show  that's a free show that's ubc ucb west right ucb west fucking love that show yeah it's awesome  great no problem with that and i don't think any comics yeah crowd's fun i don't i don't think any  comics really have a problem even doing free shows but if i watch you taking money from people at the  door i'm like none of that goes to me it all goes into the fucking club like none of it and it's 100 
[03:22:30]  payable at 10 bucks like i'm donating to your fucking improv shit like ass pennies whatever the fuck  it's called like that's my job you know so so that was the thing i was pissed off about and i posted  a thing about that and about how this is why i love kurt though he it's a real ass dude he's a real  ass dude i don't i don't think a head is how that is no this is this is what i i follow you on  facebook and you're one of my favorite people on facebook really well because you you no filter  there's no filter but you write these fucking little essays i'm a fucking blogger dude but here's 
[03:23:00]  you're not a blogger dude lowest form of life it really is i'm telling you man i really  want your facebook is always interesting always funny and it's fucking honest as shit i'm not  saying that to blow smoke in your ass because i hate facebook right but i love your facebook i  followed this whole thing this week yeah and then i saw the video you did you went up at the stand  and the ucb was supposed to meet you there and kind of dumbass patrick you know how what patrick 
[03:23:30]  set up so after i made that initial complaint not a not a fucking dentist appointment no i know  that certainly not a dentist shit too patrick so it's hilarious dude but i i did stay i like that  club stand by way it's a good club stands it greg you been there opiate no i have not it's a good  you'd like it dude you should i'm glad those guys open check it out so he read this all i got to  contribute he read this complaint i'm a little confused by the way why because it's not my world  yeah what happened the show doesn't pay comics and they charge the door i complained on facebook 
[03:24:00]  about it right patrick saw that and said hey do you want to have a debate show right and at the  stand what debate the fact they're not paying you right and in my head i'm like okay but i don't even  see what the debate is it's just basic how things work like but i'll go do it like i won that debate  already right and there was nobody there to debate yeah so patrick his idea so did he set up the debate  here's how he set it up he told them first that they were going to get an award for being in the  new york comedy scene and they were going to come collect their award and then i just burst in and 
[03:24:30]  ambush them and tell them what what is patrick giving out i mean if they fell for that that is  their fault if patrick they deserve it if they fell for it yeah they do but but like like dude what  are you doing so he goes no no we're gonna get people so then they didn't get anybody for it there  was nobody coming the whole this guy matt besser they said might be coming yeah lives in la he was  not gonna be at this show so maybe they're gonna fly him in what amazes me about this uh being an  outsider the little you guys are paid for your spots i'm amazed by that well that's the way by 
[03:25:00]  that yeah why would i first heard yeah because you guys are all really talented stand-up comics and to  get well not kelly but everybody and to get 50 a spot and then you're fighting to get it to 65  well that's just amazing i get how a showcase club works it's not like on the road let me explain it  but that should be a no-brainer just to give you the fucking 50 65 dollars  here's the thing he wasn't even asking for that he was asking for 20 yeah before we throw this out  there wait stop yeah most clubs right now where it stands right this comedy seller we'll just take 
[03:25:30]  that for example it's 85 a spot yeah on a friday and saturday to me that's low okay but here's the  deal just just i'm gonna explain it to you yeah it's a showcase club so everybody does 10 to 15  minutes so they have six comics on right um and there's clubs what's 100 seater downstairs 110  seats they get right okay um but what are they paying for a ticket they're paying 15 to  yeah on a weekend it's what is it 20 22 22 and then you got a meeting and drinking okay great how 
[03:26:00]  much does the average person um i don't know kelly bring out your phone and add it up it's probably  like 16 17 dollars a person average after the drink minimum i'd like to sell it because they have  cheap drinks some places try you know stand up new york comic shop live they charge 15 16 bucks a  drink right so they'll spend 40 a person 45 a person just on drinks i mean i the seller because it's  six comics three grand it's three grand to sell out the room just on it's three shows three shows  yeah i understand i understand with the seller because it's a really small room and there's a 
[03:26:30]  lot of comics i'm talking about these other places where it's only a couple of you guys  okay whether and they're like okay i'm working gotham right this weekend i'm getting paid up  thousands right so i'm doing a headline spot though right i'm doing an hour  uh hang on a second gotham comedy oh max this is coming out next week so it was this week so if  you didn't go you're an asshole was it good it's a great set you had a great set great amy schumer  is actually middled for me that was great that was a great drop in she just jumped on the show  nice um joe list was on the show it was horrible it was sorry about kurt though shit but um yeah so 
[03:27:00]  the i mean we get paid look maybe we should get a hundred bucks but you know the comedy sell is good  because they actually raise the money and during the week it's thirty dollars a week everybody gets  thirty bucks a show during the week um and the week nights the seller doesn't really charge they  do charge cover but people get free tickets but you can see how people are content with a pittance  of money like it's not that hard right it's not hard to make comics not complain about it it's not  about the 30 bucks or the 75 bucks it's about working on your craft getting to a point where you can 
[03:27:30]  take it on the road and get a few thousand dollars for the weekend well it's not my honor to be on the  stage at ucb it's your goddamn honor but you know the guy said that to me in so many words when i  talked to him but so anyway they i i fucking uh we're i'm supposed to do this show and then leading  up to it there became like a i didn't even realize until like a couple days before but there's all  this like tumblr shit because you this is the other thing i realized about the the people that are  taking the improv classes there there's such a community of like north korean snitches you know  there's such a fucking collection yes i mean they're just like so that's why it's on that's 
[03:28:00]  why it blew up like that i don't even think it's people complaining as much although a lot of people  were complaining like like i i wasn't trying to organize shit like people were had long-standing  grudges against ucb east that they all came out like fucking sandusky victims you know and so  so these people well i think that it's so the bottom line is they fucking uh it was this huge thing  and then uh and then i heard no one was going to come to the debate show so now i'm posting i hope  they don't punk out and because new york times is coming to it because now i'm starting to get mad 
[03:28:30]  like they're not going to come and even talk about it and then the guy contacted me matt besser who is  that he's the he's the guy with like the that looks like sideshow bob more what does he do what  is he the owner it's him amy poehler and then other guy with red hair and somebody like the guys  from ucb you know matt mckay matt besser matt wallash ian roberts uh directs uh the key and peel show  on comedy central now matt walsh is on veep well they oh they mean the uh black chris rock show  no that's uh chris rock right that's mount bell oh no that's that's okay okay so fucking uh so he 
[03:29:00]  called me up because i i think what got to him was like i was saying all this shit where i was like  calling him like doing slavery i was like like what i was doing like a slave voice online i don't know  if you read that though it's like a proud improv heritage cannot sustain itself if we pay a stand-up call  they better off here in that scary old hot jungle of a comic club  because i was getting arguments from them if you read the arguments that the improv people make 
[03:29:30]  they're insane like it's not the arguments the the ucb top guys made it's the ones the people there  make you know what i mean which is like well we're cleaning up the room for you like that's your job  anyway really did you not see it's funny it was like uh we sell beer to your fans uh we clean the  room oh i don't have to bring beer to my show and by the way they don't do that in practice it turns  out all this shit of uh it's a nurturing thing it's not like that they lord it over the comics when 
[03:30:00]  they when people come over you know like do the shows they bitch at them because there's too much  popcorn on the floor whatever the fuck and the tech guy's a fucking cunt and most of this all comes  out of ucb east but the real the real the real thing boils down to the fact that that your wife  left you oh sorry yeah why'd you have to bring back to that there was no need jesus christ wow  fucking sad i moved on why can't you mean she you mean she moved on  duly noted duly noted the real the real the real contention the debate comes about because 
[03:30:30]  these new clubs aren't used to doing stand-up shows right and they and when they did do them  they weren't doing them on a weekend and charging money that's right it was a weeknight which nobody  gives a shit about yeah so and that's what he said to me he's like we didn't know the stand-up  culture and i don't think they do man based on the shows people right they don't understand stand-up  culture at all well i talked i talked to them today and they told me you know a couple things one is 
[03:31:00]  you know they could pay if they raise the ticket prices to fifteen dollars or twenty dollars but  they don't want to do that because they want it to be an open place for people to come and see  the show yeah but that particular show on friday raised the fucking ticket price of fifteen that  you're still cheaper than the other places you know and then his his other point is that those  places aren't aren't supposed to be treated like a common club they're supposed to be a place where  you'd screw around okay fine but i i i understand his thought process it should be a workout space for  you but uh not a place for you but here's the thing i'm not working out so you agree so you agree 
[03:31:30]  with them no i'm saying it's i'm saying i'm asking i'm asking your opinion do you think that  it should be free do you think you should be able to do stand-up on a friday night in a packed crowd  at ucb because of what it is and what they represent do you think you should say take the  hit and fucking if you're gonna work there you don't get paid that's it i don't know that they  should be doing that no i i don't think just because there's three locations in his head it's a  special unique place but you got three locations dude so that means they built a business model 
[03:32:00]  well that's based on never like they built some commie fucking system that like it all goes i  just look we fucking here's the thing all right but guys guys guys guys here's the thing let me  let me just let me just cut lewis off don't you fucking dare you cunt i do i do have a better  understanding of what because the guy talked to me he wasn't like he wanted an apology or something  like he was pretty nice and calm i talked to him so i understand how they're thinking a lot better  so i'm not as enraged right as i was initially are you gonna be able to go back there  are you done oh i don't know i mean that's not a uh would you go back yeah to the fucking 
[03:32:30]  whiplash and shit yeah i just i'm not doing a friday night thing that's packed and not getting  paid i just not i think that that's the point though it's like you have every right to just  say i don't want to perform at the place and hold on let me listen there's there's people like kelly  that are never going to get paid and she needs this christ you needed to cut the what were you  going to say how much are we talking about here like 20 but dude i see it's unbelievable yeah it is  it is but they i mean his thing is that's it that's just insulting yeah it's going to open 
[03:33:00]  right i understand you're working on your shit and it's not like you're out of town you know  you know headlining but but i got letters you should get something every time you get on a  fucking stage and and perform for people no matter what if you paid if the whole thing was  20 lousy dollars yeah if you had to pay somebody those are all things i said how many people were  performing that night like five like five hundred fucking dollars how many people it's not an  amateur well i'm saying on friday it's not an amateur fun show it's a pro show  and you're not doing new stuff at a hundred people hot crowd i gotta show up and do my job 
[03:33:30]  in that in that case so you're not providing this well you have no choice you don't have new jokes but  if you had to pay somebody every time they went on stage the only guys are going to get paid are at  a certain level so there almost has to be a scene of people that aren't paid to do it and that's how  you fucking grow old improvers no that's not true dude let me tell you something when you started in  comedy dude in philly you did fucking open mics that were sold out at black rooms i mean dude they  didn't pay the comics but you had to go and pay your dues absolutely you had to go be become you  had to strive for something you know i'm thinking i think look right now i'm just i'm coming into a 
[03:34:00]  place where i'm starting to make that was during a weeknight they have the open mic during a week  night right look i don't disagree with you i think you should never work for fucking free  so why can't i will i will work i think the point is why can't kirk get booked somewhere on a weekend  where he gets paid he does why can't he only perform at easy well yeah i would have just  you can't get a better gig if they just paid me and said fuck everybody else there i wouldn't have  said shit the problem with that now is is that they're not going to pay people on like a friday  or saturday night show people like kirk are going to go fuck that i'm going to go somewhere else 
[03:34:30]  no he should no no but that's the point because they're not looking at in terms of like longevity  because now that booker is going to go well i'll get someone else who's not as good they're not  booking it though a comic comes in and produces the show themselves and gets no cut of the door  yeah but that comic that's booking isn't booking kirk now they're probably booking someone that's  at a lower level than kirk because kirk couldn't do it and then that's who should work for free  that's what they should know caliber of show is going down who gives a fuck it should go down  on a weekend on a weekend you see what the other solution is they're probably just going to 
[03:35:00]  eliminate having friday night shows to not have a fight because they really hold fast to this that  they're going to open a pandora's box that's what he's calling it 20 wow i look dude just how you  just like me you live in a weird world i mean at your stage in your career you should get paid  every time you get in front but my whole thing is i don't want to start a union and shit i don't  give a shit no i understand i don't care if they change how they do it at all my whole point when  i said it was why are you when you want to produce a show going to this place you're like okay listen  you do the work promoting and we're going to take all the money and uh you get to say it's at ucb like 
[03:35:30]  why why would you because i know comics said i'm not taking that fucking deal and like cara that runs if  you build it i'm like cara why is your show there if that's what you get like why would you  stop being fucking punks because it's ucb there's three locations it's not a special unique  fucking thing anymore it's a fucking it's like papa john's or something at this point and it's  and it's the principal yeah you're not you're not looking to get rich i'm not i don't need a  fucking here's what you're getting here's what you're getting cab money food money yeah you're 
[03:36:00]  getting a little taste of the action to hold you off to go there and be creative be the best you  can so that people will come back we're not improv we're stand-up comics right so if you're gonna  have stand-up comedy show you should have played by stand you should abide by the rules that the  stand-up comics set up right five or six years ago we set up a comic union yeah this is if you're  gonna have a stand-up comedy show in fucking new york city you have to pay twenty dollars to this guy 
[03:36:30]  eighty sixty or eighty five dollars to this guy during the week and on weekends that's it fuck you  that's what we agreed on and even people don't hold it but hold on where do these guys that are  coming up that aren't at the level where they don't have credits they still have to work on  the craft where do they come in if the if you're having a professional show right it's an amateur  show that that's where they go but those are amateur shows for the most part not that friday show  so that's it well here's the deal different thing okay so if they have if they have brought that on  herself if they have you on kurt me kelly and you me and kurt should get paid 
[03:37:00]  and you guys don't because you're amateurs you son of a bitch so i mean look if i'm i'd pay you  if i'm a professional baby if i'm walking to the door and i i'm a headlining comic around the country  and you're having me do your show you pay me fucking money you kurt you you you should get money  right okay kelly you should get the stage time and maybe a little but i get it if they don't pay her  and she's on she's gonna work a friday night in front of a hot crowd i should at least get a drink 
[03:37:30]  seriously you should get a drink either way now it's doomed because either they just cut the  show completely or the caliber is going to go down and people aren't going to be seeing such a hot  show anymore they're going to go from 100 to 80 to 60 by the way here's why they will though because  there's thousands of fucking comics in new york city by the way i'm not going to keep it i hate  this fucking they're going to take the show they won't pay and let me tell you something there's  guys that are on a fucking level there's guys that work the cellar that do free fucking shows  every night all around the town i'll do a free show of course i'll do a free show too i wouldn't work 
[03:38:00]  half the time but not not if but not if you are taking money from like if the door is 50 and give  me fucking five dollars of it at least motherfucker like that's the thing but i think you have the  right to say i'm just not going to do the show i don't know i i feel like the way that i did it's  fucking america dude people can set up whatever business model they want we have every right to  go fuck you i'm not working your club that's it that's and that's all i'm saying like every comic  should individually not be a bitch and fucking not i agree it's not it's not us unified the problem is  there's too many comics that's really the fucking problem listen yeah everybody says everybody says 
[03:38:30]  that why don't you comics we can't because we're not look if someone takes away my gig and you'll  take it because you got a family and if someone's going to pay you to do a show that i was going to  do this you know the same money i'm going to get even though you don't deserve it you're not there yet  whatever you're going to take it and you'll do a fine enough job nobody the crowd is not going to  know no they have no difference right you know what i'm saying it's so it doesn't matter that's  why you'll step in and fucking do that that's why we can't get a union because we're not groups we're 
[03:39:00]  individual businesses individual businesses yeah and it's a cutthroat fucking business man yeah so  my whole thing was just that like you as an individual yeah if you get a shit they don't give  a fuck they don't care about selling tickets that's unbelievable that's it do they ever take care of  you guys outside the deal like they know they have a good night so they're like you know what i know  i know what the deal is but here i've had club owners do that i've had club owners where i walk i  come in i do the show my deal is what my deal is you know i i have a guy's go look we had a great 
[03:39:30]  weekend with you here's some extra cash vinnie brand has done that all right me and my me and my  brother own a restaurant it's a little obviously it's different but if he has a really good night  he fucking walks around he doesn't give a fuck what he pays these guys and he goes thank you  to who to his workers no shit and it makes those fucking guys way more loyal and it makes them work  work even harder for him they want to they want to work for my brother yeah this guy doesn't  understand and he does little stupid things he knows it's someone's birthday he gets a dumb cake  and throws it in the back for him i mean you just got to do those little bones and that's all you got 
[03:40:00]  to do with that shit just it's always infuriated me over the years just in my business with radio  and stuff it's like yeah the littlest thing like i make a i make a lot of money doing radio yeah but  when they do that tiny little fucking thing it makes me appreciate you know them so much more and i want  to be there and i want to work hard that's why i try to tell that's why i was asking how much  i mean they're they're fucking fighting over twenty dollars it's ridiculous the value of that twenty  dollars to you would be great i got i got letter i got messages from people that have improv teams 
[03:40:30]  that are like in this pandora's box and having to pay that he's talking about yeah there's there's  improv is they're like we're packing the show out with our show we're packing it out and they're  not paying us anything so you know some clubs i go in yeah i don't i don't take the money  like if it's a small club and they don't and they're not making and they're like we'll give  you money to and i i just walk out i don't take it i don't want your money i'll come and help you  out you guys that's what i'd want this guy to understand a lot of comics will do that you guys  should be working helping out each other right i'll go i'll go to a show and help them out if 
[03:41:00]  they're struggling club right you know what i mean and i don't i don't like the stand i don't want  your money i'll come out and do a show for you yeah and i want them i'll promote you okay but even  eastville i used to go i don't i used to be like dude i don't keep your money i don't give a fuck  just give me a cup of water let me get some stage time you should fucking make mark i'll give you  every time don't you ever fucking do that why because that motherfucker underpays comics and  he treats people like shit that's what he treated me like shit yes you don't know how he talks to  the fucking guys he thinks he's above and you don't know how he talks about your back 
[03:41:30]  what did he no it's uh you guys live in a weird world that's all this loser won't even take my  money what a fag it's it is a fucked up world but it's a strange world here the thing is too is that  even on the road at the the higher levels yeah like you with me it's like i'll see what's like  i'll have one club pay me this much money which is fucking respectable i know how much i make you 
[03:42:00]  i know how much you make on ticket sales i know how much you make on booze are you making thousands  you make it 30 grand for the weekend so you're gonna pay me you know this much no i and there's  some guys that pay me what a really nice chunk of that right and i look at i don't want more right  i don't want less but i don't want more i don't need to fucking drag you over the coals for every  nickel and dime but then there's other guys that want me to do the same fucking job and it for less  money with no no perks no friendliness no right no no nothing and it's like fuck i don't i'd rather 
[03:42:30]  not even fucking deal with you then there's guys who can't pay me what these guys pay me yeah but  they they treat me nice they they pick me up they do like like mcguires and fucking they can't pay me  what uh wilbur theater pays me right or what gotham pays me but i'll go out there and i'll work their  club they send me a fucking limo yeah i took i took the but the train out there one night the 
[03:43:00]  guy's like how'd you get here and i'm like i took the train he's like fuck that you're taking a limo  home he just hooked me up with a limo so i don't know shit that's long island though yeah limos are  easy to get on long island first of all the guy there the guy how many dents were in the limo  you know the guy owns the company okay you know what i mean the guy's like it's a good let's put it this  way he was like dude i'll get you a fucking limo hey tony get him a fucking limo i was poor growing  up and i was in a bunch of limos they're easy to get out there well that's your percentage of uh club  owners around the country that take care of you bobby the percentage well the club here's the thing 
[03:43:30]  is that i the clubs that i work now are mainly the ones that take care of me i don't have to i don't  okay before that before you were able to pick and choose i would probably say uh 25 we're good  were really like look and when i say good like the houston laugh stop which is now closed  the guy who owned it had you know he's a fucking nutcase but he would bring me in twice a year to  build up my fan base i went in i middled for dane there once and then he said i like you too i think 
[03:44:00]  you should be headlining i want to build you here he brought me in twice a year to headline he paid me  enough money that i could pay bills and it was nice for me put me up in a fucking great hotel  pick me up for lunch we went shooting fucking guns all this stupid shit yeah yeah because it's  not about the money yeah side splitters in tampa the guy brings me in twice a little it's just a  little things twice a year gives me a nice hotel and even this last weekend the contract was fucked up  and he didn't technically have to give me bonuses right but i had five sold out shows 
[03:44:30]  so he's like dude we got it your contract fucked you because they they gave you more money on the  top end but now with these bonuses you're fucked but we're still going to take care of you right so  it's like okay cool it evened out you know what i mean right well it's like cool i don't want to  have to fucking worry about i want to you know my dream is to be able to show up at a gig you make  money i make money yeah that's it i just want to make you money so you don't fucking you don't have  anxiety about me right i want to just come in and have great shows but you draw away i mean you're
