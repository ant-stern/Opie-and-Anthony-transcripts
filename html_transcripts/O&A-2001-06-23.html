<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment focused on a caller, Matt, seeking advice on how to have sex with his prom date, Wendy.  The hosts, along with in-studio guest Iron Mike Grayson, offered graphic and sexually explicit advice.  Multiple callers shared their own sexually explicit prom night experiences.  This was followed by a performance from John Valby, a musician known for his explicit lyrics, whose set involved much speculation about which lines would be censored by the station.  The segment concluded with the “What’s in My Pants” game, featuring a caller, Susan (a lifeguard), describing sounds emanating from her genitals for the hosts and callers to guess.

Next, the show featured Ron Jeremy and "Stalker Patty," a 46-year-old virgin caller, in a game where Patty searched for concert tickets hidden in Ron Jeremy's pants. This involved much crude humor and suggestive commentary from the hosts and Ron Jeremy.  Additional money was hidden in the same location, further escalating the suggestive nature of the game. Mario Cantone then joined the show in studio. The conversation shifted to his career, heckling experiences, and the hosts mocked Don Imus's frail appearance on his radio return. A caller, Sal, recounted an Erisman concert experience resulting in severe ear ringing, requesting Metallica tickets as compensation.  His mother joined the conversation, adding to the humorous anecdotes. The segment concluded with a prank call to a home improvement store featuring a woman struggling to pronounce "caulk."

The show continued with a caller recounting his parents having sex while he and his brother watched "Steam Pipe Alley." This transitioned into a discussion about Bob Crane and the release of videos of his sex life by his son, with graphic descriptions from the hosts and Lewis Black (in studio).  Black also shared his negative review of "Moulin Rouge," criticizing Nicole Kidman and Mariah Carey. The conversation abruptly shifted to the living situation of a listener, “Stinky,” who lived with an alleged 62-year-old pedophile, including audio clips of Stinky’s complaints.  A prank call segment followed, featuring Spaz calling an intoxicated Psycho Mark after a Mets game, pretending a commercial was missing.  The show wrapped up with a discussion of a Bill Cosby postage stamp and an interview with someone who spent 36 hours with Mike Tyson in Las Vegas, recounting Tyson's unusual behavior and statements.

Finally, a segment dedicated to a Mike Tyson article was aired. The hosts read excerpts detailing Tyson's exotic pets (tigers he punched in the testicles), medication use (Prozac and Zoloft, with humorous descriptions of side effects), violent tendencies (punching people, himself, and biting), prison experiences, relationship with Robin Givens (including a violent incident), and attempts to become a "nice guy."  The hosts frequently mimicked Tyson's voice and mannerisms. Callers shared their experiences and fears regarding Tyson.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Tyson's personality and violent past, with continued mimicking of his character by the hosts.  The show utilized numerous jokes about punching (particularly in the testicles), graphic descriptions of violence, and humorous speculations about Tyson’s sexuality and perception of history.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  O.B. Anthony. O.B. Anthony.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  All right, Anthony, let's go to Matt.  Matt's going to his prom tonight. Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  How you doing?  Prom night, huh?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  All right, give us the details. What high school?  Cardoza High School, Queens.  Right on.  All right, you got yourself a date, obviously.  Yeah, I'm going with my girlfriend. We'll call her Wendy.  All right.  Okay, and your girlfriend of how long?  Not too long, about a month.  About a month, huh?  Yeah.  Have you gotten any action yet?  Minimal.  Have you gotten patch?  Oh, yeah.  What do you mean?  I got to patch last week.  You got to patch?  Yes, yes.  You got your hand down her pants?  Yeah.  Now, did you get to patch, or did you go a little further and get to pet the poodle? 
[00:01:00]  Uh, I pet the poodle.  Pet the poodle.  Did, uh, let's just say, did, um, were you able to, uh, count all five fingers of your  hand while you did it?  I would not.  Oh.  Oh, look at you.  Okay.  Interesting.  Very good.  Very good.  But, uh, no, uh, sex?  No, no.  Okay.  So you...  I don't think I'll be, uh, doing that tonight either way.  What?  What?  Have you, have you padded the canoe driver on the head? 
[00:01:30]  No.  You haven't?  You haven't touched his bald head?  Uh, no.  You didn't?  No.  But you just...  But wait, wait.  This isn't making sense.  Well, well, maybe he doesn't really know what's going on down there.  Do you, do, uh, do you know where the canoe driver, uh, drives the canoe?  Um, the guy doesn't know what he's talking about.  See?  I thought so.  I was going to say, if you're a little older, you would know.  It's the most sensitive of the most intimate area of the woman.  See, we're putting a visual in your head.  I got you.  There's a canoe, if you know what I mean, and a canoe driver. 
[00:02:00]  And he's always at the back of the boat.  Yes.  Right.  Have you touched him on the head?  Um, I believe I did.  Okay.  Okay, good.  And has...  You love that head for good luck, right?  Has she reciprocated by, uh, putting her hand, uh, in places?  That's the problem.  Uh-oh.  Oh.  Okay.  She hasn't put her hand, uh, down your pants?  No.  All right.  I, I got it.  Have you grabbed it and, uh, tried to shove it down your pants?  Like Bill Cosby did tonight, chick that went up to his apartment? 
[00:02:30]  Allegedly.  That worked.  Come here, baby.  Grab my putting pop.  Maybe I should have said, what are we going to do about this?  Well, no, I don't know.  That was the advice I was going to give all the kids going to their prom tonight.  If she's, uh, shy enough not to touch it, I think you may frighten her if you just, uh,  pull it out.  Now, um, how far has she gone, uh, with you?  Uh.  Yellow.  Hasn't really done anything.  But you, what was she doing?  You put your hand down, uh, her pants. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  I did not get the reciprocation.  Any dry humping, as they call it?  Oh, naturally.  Where you, uh, get, uh, on a couch somewhere and you start, uh, rubbing against each other  through the pants?  Naturally.  Boy, that leaves you hurting.  Oh, you don't even last.  You get the, uh, what they call blue balls, Opie.  Yeah.  It hurts very much.  And then you get chafing.  Oh, really?  I had never heard of that one before.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm explaining to you.  Hey, wait.  Let me write that down so I can tell everyone what I learned on the show today.  I'm explaining to everybody using you as the, uh, person I'm talking to. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, I see.  Yeah.  Opie, Sophie.  I learned that in radio school, too.  Put a picture of, uh, the person you want to talk to and communicate with.  Put a picture.  In the studio.  If it's a family, put a picture of a family that you cut out of a magazine in front of  you doing the radio, and that's your audience.  It gives you someone to talk to.  That's what they...  Shut up.  That's what they taught me in college.  I'm like, shut up.  That's great.  I like putting pictures of porn stars up, so that way you can talk to them.  Yeah.  Uh, so, so, uh, hmm, you've done that.  Was she into it when you added your hand down there? 
[00:04:00]  Oh, definitely.  She was into it?  Definitely.  Oh, God, this is a tough nut to crack, Opie.  It's...  I understand this, because she's kind of really shy.  Obviously a virgin?  Um, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, maybe more liquor.  Roofies.  Roofies.  No, no, no.  Um, does she drink?  Um, we'll find out later today.  I don't think so.  Oh, wow, that's even tougher.  Yeah.  I haven't predicted me. 
[00:04:30]  Has she, uh, has she promised anything for the prom, or?  Actually, she has.  What?  What?  Uh, I should be getting a Hummer.  Come on.  Then you're set.  She's...  What?  She won't touch it, but she'll do that?  Apparently so.  It's prom, though.  How did she tell you that she was going to do that?  Well, um...  Give me the exact words.  She's a listener of the show.  Yeah.  And, uh, hopefully she's not listening now.  And, uh, I said something to the fact that, um, uh, how about you induct me to the Tuesday  Night Hammer Club?  And she says, but I won't see you on Tuesday. 
[00:05:00]  I'll see you on Wednesday.  Oh.  That sort of sounds cryptic, though.  Yeah.  It doesn't mean she's going to do it.  She just said, I'll see you on Wednesday.  That's right.  Well, let's, uh, let's keep our fingers crossed and see what happens tonight.  All right.  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to bet you're going to get some action  tonight.  Have you, uh, have you been, uh, obviously excited in front of her?  Oh, yeah.  Naturally.  And what does she do?  Look at it and go, huh?  No, she just, you know.  Have you, have you, uh, have you, uh, rolled over and, like, shoved it against her leg or 
[00:05:30]  something?  Maybe I should.  You haven't, you haven't done the spaz move yet, have you?  No.  All right.  Oh, my God.  That's a tough one.  Yeah.  I'm going to predict them in here, guys.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Where are you guys going after the prom?  Uh, to a club.  To a club?  Do you got hotel rooms or anything like that?  No, then we're going to the beach.  Oh, the old beach.  Yeah.  That's the only sand out of your ass.  Yep.  I did the beach thing.  It didn't work too well for me. 
[00:06:00]  Um, that's the problem.  Uh, what, like 20, 30, going to the beach?  Yeah, pretty much.  Probably a cap to school.  Right.  You might want to bring, uh, like a, like a blanket or something.  Doing that, definitely.  Okay.  Wow.  I don't know, man.  I, this is the hardest advice I've ever had to give.  I don't know.  I figured you guys would help me if anyone would be able to.  Well, let's, uh, we have someone in the studio that might be able to help you.  Hold on a second, okay?  Hello, Matt.  Hi, it's Iron Mike Grayson. 
[00:06:30]  Hey, Iron Mike.  I've been with a couple of women that, uh, sound similar to your, uh, lovely girlfriend.  And, uh, what you gotta do is treat them with patience and tenderness and loving care and, uh, right hook.  Because once they're in drastic pain, bleeding, and semi-conscious, they become more receptive to the Louisiana black snake of Iron Mike.  Should I punch you in the uterus, Iron Mike? 
[00:07:00]  Well, no, well, now you're getting carried away, Matt.  First, a couple of light body blows to the breakfasts.  Use them like a speed bag.  Watch.  I'll demonstrate on my new hose bag I'm here in the hotel with.  Here, like this.  Shut up!  And then some, uh, light body blows.  Working your way down lovingly.  You know, you start with the face.  And then the body. 
[00:07:30]  And work your way down to the uterus and wind up, I mean, pull this punch from Mississippi.  And then, wham, right into the uterus.  And then she won't care about something as small as a white man's penis.  Good luck, Matt.  Thanks, Iron Mike.  Hey, uh, Matt, a lot of people checking in saying you gotta use the Jay Moore line.  If she's a friend of the show, maybe you can do it, but keep your, like, your pants on.  Oh, for the record, I'm, uh, two for two with what we can do about this.  You are?  Then go three for three.  What the hell?  Who are the lucky guys? 
[00:08:00]  That old gag.  Yeah, try the, what are we gonna do about this line?  I don't think that's gonna work with her.  Why?  Yeah, she's, uh, she hasn't been listening that long.  Oh, really?  She's not familiar with the Jay Moore episode.  Would you like us to give her a call to see if you're gonna get any action today?  Hey, we'll help you out.  Uh, that's quite all right.  Damn, why don't people allow us to call their girls anymore?  If I'm not that stupid, guys.  Hey, when you go to pin her corsage on?  Hey, does she have a father?  A what? 
[00:08:30]  A father.  A father.  Yeah.  You gotta go pick her up with the mother and father there?  No, we're meeting somewhere.  Oh, you're lying?  Oh, you are?  Yeah, I've met the parents.  They're cool people.  You're so lucky.  Why don't you go to the house like they do in the movies?  I hate that.  You gotta go to the house and there's the father ushering his little girl out the door  knowing she's probably gonna come back limping.  It's like, it's like the gazelle, uh, you know, giving their young to the lion.  Oh, man.  You know what the best thing to do is?  You go up to the father before you leave and ask him if he has any condoms. 
[00:09:00]  You got any condoms?  I don't know what this bitch has.  That's a good icebreaker with the pop.  Why?  It works well.  That works, right?  You're sitting there watching TV, you know?  Bonding, watching a little, uh, hockey, maybe the Stanley Cup or something.  And then you break out that line, right?  And then you break that line out.  Maybe I should ask her what a daughter likes to drink.  Oh, that's a good one.  Exactly.  All right, Louie.  Louie's a limo driver. 
[00:09:30]  He's seen a bunch of proms.  He's got some...  Oh, that's a good guy.  Yeah.  He's got some advice from Matt.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Uh, Louie, sorry, Louie.  Yeah, listen, I'm a limo driver.  I've been doing this for a very long time.  Prom season is nothing, all right?  All this kid has to do is give the limo driver a hundred bucks,  limo driver lock the doors, put the music on, he's done.  Even if he wants condoms, limo driver usually has them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's just got to get over the penisophobia that she's got.  Yeah, that's it, man.  Don't be afraid.  Just go for it, you know?  Believe me, everything works out right by the end of the night. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  Thanks a lot, Louie.  All right, Louie.  Thank you.  Thanks.  All right, Matt, while you're on your own, let us know what happens tomorrow.  All right, I'll give you guys a call.  I might be a little, um, not able to call you guys tomorrow, but I'll call Friday.  Yeah, that's cool.  All right.  I'm betting you get some action.  I'll let you guys know.  You got to call up and tell us the truth.  We don't want, we don't like people lying on our own.  I'm a faithful listener.  I've been listening for almost a year.  I would not lie.  All right, cool.  All right.  Thank you, Matt.  All right, later, guys.  All right.  Hobson, Hobson, do you have any condoms?  I think I'm going to get lucky. 
[00:10:30]  Nothing worse than having to meet the dad.  I like girls without fathers.  Yeah.  I swear to God.  I've been lucky with that lately, too.  Yeah?  Yeah.  With the girls without the dads.  That you got to deal with.  One, two, three.  My last three girlfriends didn't have fathers.  You take care of my little girl.  Oh, yeah.  Don't worry, Pop.  I'll take care of a whack bag.  Whack bag.  Hey, Pop, does she like the yam bag on the chin or on her ass? 
[00:11:00]  Huh?  You brought her up.  Anthony, I think we got audio of Matt after doing it with his prom date.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Let me go to that right now.  Look what I did to you again.  How did Jamaican Mike get into that limo?  I don't know.  Butt sex.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Some butt sex.  Do you think there are people out there that have butt sex on the prom? 
[00:11:30]  Butt?  Wow.  I mean, that's really making the jump.  You know?  I mean, butt sex at the prom.  When you're at that age for proms and stuff, you're just hoping to get, like, patch or something.  Can you imagine that?  Is there anyone out there that gets, like, butt sex for the prom?  It starts with a gentle kiss on the cheek and a pinning of the corsage at the parents' house and ends with butt sex?  How do you make that jump?  Butt sex.  I don't know, man. 
[00:12:00]  That's quite the jump.  Hey, Dan, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  I want to know if Anthony's going to be using these lines when he goes to the prom this year with his new girlfriend.  Hey, that's pretty funny.  Shut up.  Where did that come from?  I'm sorry, Anthony.  I usually control the calls a little better than that.  Oh, prom.  Pete, what's up?  Imagine how ridiculous I look at a prom.  Where's my scotch or something?  Give me a drink.  You know, that's another bit that, like, you know, just those ridiculous DJs do, though. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  They go to, like, the prom with one of their listeners or something.  We'll take you to the prom.  One of our lucky listeners is going to be going to the prom with me.  Yeah, that's just...  And it's like, you know, just another example of really bad zoo, morning zoo type radio.  Hey, we'll take you to the prom.  Let's go to Pete.  Pete, you're next on WNEW.  Hey, Pete.  Yeah, what's up?  Let's go.  Yeah, I want to tell Matt not to get his hopes up, man, because my prom, I had everything  set up. 
[00:13:00]  The girl told me I was going to get lucky, and that's where we coined the term FOC, fear  of.  Oh, she had fear of...  All right, we got...  Yeah, he helped with the limo driver and everything, and I struck out.  $800 later, I ended up with blue balls.  I think most people strike out on the prom, on the prom night.  It's amateur night, man.  It's like New Year's Eve.  Oh, yeah, you know?  Because all the girls are out.  The girls that do it and the girls that don't do it.  That's right.  You better off going to a bar and spending all that money on liquor and getting lucky with 
[00:13:30]  some other girl.  And I got to say it, half the girls that go to the proms, they have those F me dresses  on and stuff.  Yeah, but it doesn't matter.  They don't want to do it.  The dresses have come a long way.  To them, in the pants, it's like this.  Might as well be.  It might as well be.  All right, Pete.  All right, man.  We have a guy that's claiming he got anal at his prom.  There's no way you're getting butt sex at the prom.  Alex.  Hey.  Remember, we don't like liars on this show.  Right. 
[00:14:00]  I swear, but you have to do the trick.  You can't be trying to score with your date.  What?  There's no way.  Everyone strikes out in the prom.  I totally agree with you when you go with your date.  But if you start to fool around with your friend's date, that's when you get laid.  Wait a minute.  You got anal from your friend's date?  We all were friends.  It was like a big group.  My whole crew of friends.  My friend, we just go with her as friends.  We were drunk.  We got a little friendly, and then we started to take our clothes off in the bathroom, and 
[00:14:30]  she gave me anal in the shower.  Butt sex.  At least it was in the shower.  She was a, can I say W-H-O-R-E on the air here?  Yeah, you can say whore.  There we go.  She was a whore.  She was a good girl.  Gee.  Oh, yeah.  There's nothing wrong.  There's nothing like a good whore.  When you're getting anal on your prom night.  All right.  Well, thank you, Alex.  There it is, Anthony.  Someone that got, uh...  But that's a technicality. 
[00:15:00]  That's a technicality.  Puss-a!  It wasn't his...  Butt sex.  Puss-a!  It wasn't his, uh...  It wasn't his date.  I'm sticking in my mouth.  Whoa.  What are you talking about there?  That's...  I don't know what you're talking about there, Anthony.  Oh.  I can't see making the move in the traditional prom date where you go, pick up the date from  the house.  You know, the mother and father are waving with smiles on their faces. 
[00:15:30]  A little tear in their eyes as the little girl goes off into the car and drives away  on her prom night looking all nice.  And a few short hours later, we fast forward.  Backseat.  Butt sex.  I don't see it.  Oh, this poor guy.  This is what I'm dreading someday.  Thank God my wife's not born yet.  It's been many years to go.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  All right.  Guys, you're killing me.  What's the matter?  I got a 15-year-old daughter. 
[00:16:00]  She's going to the prom for the first time Friday night.  Puss-a!  Oh, no.  Are you just freaking?  I'll tell you what.  It's Friday night.  Yeah.  This kid comes to the door.  Yeah.  I'm inviting him in.  Yeah.  I'm sitting him down in the living room.  Yeah.  I'm going to be cleaning my gun.  That won't matter.  He'll be cleaning his with your daughter later.  Puss-a!  Oh, Anthony, you speak from experience.  It doesn't matter.  I remember going out with this girl, and her father took me aside, and he was driving  me home one day. 
[00:16:30]  And he goes, yeah, let me drive you home.  And the girl that I was going out with said, my father wants to have a talk with you.  You know, I'm like, oh, boy, the talk.  You know, God, I hate chicks with fathers.  Now, wait, wait.  Is this the father that used to drop the girl off to your place so he could bang her?  Yeah.  Same girl?  But he didn't know that she was getting dropped.  It's a hilarious story, though.  You were what, 14, 15?  No, this was like when I was about 16, 17.  All right, but the father would drop his daughter off at your house.  Yes.  Almost every afternoon, right?  No, no, it was the weekends. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, okay.  And, you know, back at that age, you weren't, like, doing it every day because there just  wasn't a place to do it.  But my mom was working nights on the weekends, so we used to have parties over the house.  So everyone would come over, play poker, and have their respective girlfriends and have  sex with them.  So he would drop her off.  We'd go inside.  And it was just like, there was no time, so we would just run right to the bedroom and  do what we did.  And then he would come, pick her up, beep, beep.  All right.  Pick her up. 
[00:17:30]  Like, he's the pimp.  Exactly.  He was the pimp man.  He was doing the same thing that the guys do that drive the chicks around for bachelor  parties.  But before any of this happened, like, she goes, oh, he wants to have a talk with you.  I'm like, okay.  So I hop in his work van.  He's driving me home.  And he's like this real mean looking guy.  And I'm just like a dopey kid and stuff.  And he's telling me, you know, you're a little older than my daughter.  Because I think I was 17 and she was 15.  Yeah.  Something like that.  And I'm like, yeah, no, I know. 
[00:18:00]  And he's telling me about, you know, respecting her, blah, blah, blah.  And, you know, don't do anything to her because you'll have to answer to me.  And all I'm thinking is, way big, way big.  That's all that was in my head as I'm looking at him.  And he's talking about this because I know what he's talking about.  Yeah.  Talking about sex.  He's talking about teen sex, Opie.  Teen sex.  Teen sex.  And all I was thinking.  And then I'm thinking, oh, my God, I hope he can't read my mind.  And I'm trying to block out of my head what I'm thinking.  Because I'm thinking of his new daughter getting banged. 
[00:18:30]  And I'm like, oh, if he can read my mind, I'm dead.  I'm sunk.  And I'm trying to, like, think of a brick wall.  Yeah.  So he can't break through it.  Oh, man.  But, yeah, he used to drop her off.  No, Sean C. from Jersey.  I think you were 33 and she was 12.  No.  No.  That isn't the case.  Thank you very much.  All right, Anthony.  Wow.  I see it on your face.  You're thinking of butt sex, aren't you?  With my daughter.  I can read your mind. 
[00:19:00]  Lots of great calls on hold.  If you're on hold, please stay there.  We need all of you guys today, okay?  Also, some girl that wants to meet Psycho Marx on line 10.  A bunch of other people that had anal during their prom.  If you're lying, we don't want to hear from you.  You, you.  No way.  No way.  If you're lying, please hang out.  You can't make that jump.  Take one for the team and hang up if you're lying, because we hate liars on this show.  That's going from sixth grade to college.  There's no way it happened.  You're making a huge jump. 
[00:19:30]  Maybe, yeah.  Maybe now that they've loosened the rules and gay people can take their dates to the prom,  and that's the only way you're getting butt sex.  Yeah, we forgot to talk to the other guy.  We never confirmed that it was a female.  I had anal.  Yeah, me and Bill.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Nice.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:20:00]  Toll free, 877-692-1027.  Look who's in the studio, Anthony.  John Valby.  Hey.  John Valby.  How are you?  Now you got your keyboard in front of you.  I do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the only thing I can get out of here. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, I know.  Usually we have to bleep out of here.  Well, we're going to try.  John comes in, I don't know, like three or four times a year,  and he sings his songs, and we dump out of most of his songs.  And then the next day, we get to put the bleeps in.  Right.  They don't call him Dr. Dirty for nothing.  Have you been working on some clean stuff, John?  You know, I have a limerick I want to try.  Yeah?  You know, it goes, let me see.  Women like to size up a man's staff.  Then chit-chat and get a good laugh.  But since that Komodo dragon, Sharon Stone's been bragging 
[00:21:00]  that her man has a foot and a half.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sharon Stone is a federally protected wetland.  Hey, I think that might have made it.  That might have made it.  Sure.  Yeah.  I think you're one for one so far.  That's good.  You know, the thing I'm most excited about is coming out today  is a movie that we made right here in this studio with you guys. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Oh, man.  There's the poster in front of us.  John Valby, Dr. Dirty, O&A, and T&A.  And T&A.  Yeah.  Yeah, you filmed the last few appearances on our show,  made a tape out of it, and it looks really good.  Yeah, and Gary Tepper did it, and man, he did a great job.  Cecil B. DeMille, I call him now.  You know, the cuts were really good, and, you know,  you guys were funny, too.  No, what's great about it is this is the unedited version.  Oh, this is.  Because the cameras were rolling when John was singing all the songs  that we had to dump out on our show. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, and seeing us frantically go back and forth,  trying to find what we could get in and stuff.  Yeah.  It was neat.  And what, you got some footage of you in concert as well?  Yes.  Nice.  Our listeners are going to want this, I'm telling you right now.  Is there any way?  It just got finished last night, so we're printing them up as fast as we can.  They only have 50 copies.  I started laughing at them.  50 copies.  Well, there's only going to be about 20, 30 people there tonight, right?  Yeah, sure.  There's going to be at least 1,500 people there tonight, John.  Yeah.  Are you ready for that?  I'm ready. 
[00:22:30]  Let's rock.  All right.  Man, this is going to be good.  And this is the longest day of the year, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That it is.  Do you have a song about that?  I don't know where he was going.  I wasn't going there.  My wife told me it was going to be really weird tonight.  Yeah.  And she wanted me to report on that.  Uh-huh.  She believes in that, you know, psychic forces and all that kind of stuff.  Oh, the astrology and all that.  Yeah, all that the forces of the planet is in opposition.  Call me now.  I'm Dr. Dirty's wife.  Call me now for your free psychic reading. 
[00:23:00]  I played in a Greaseman thing once in Maryland.  Yeah, you did.  Dr. Dirty's wife.  On the side of a hill there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He finally came down.  Yeah.  That's cool.  Let's try another song.  We're one for one.  Oh, let's do a little.  I hate Bob Rebo.  I hate Bob Rebo.  Oh, my goddamn outhouse blues.  Mama's in jail. 
[00:23:30]  Papa's on a bail.  Sister's on a choreo and stuff's for sale.  I hate Bob Rebo.  Oh, I hate Bob Rebo.  Oh, my goddamn outhouse blues.  Still my favorite.  Mama's on the bottom.  Daddy's on top.  Baby's in the corner.  Y'all stick it to her pop.  I hate Bob Rebo.  I hate Bob Rebo.  Oh, my goddamn outhouse blues. 
[00:24:00]  How about one more?  I know girl.  Her name is Pam.  She uses a frisbee for a diaphragm.  I hate Bob Rebo.  I hate Bob Rebo.  Oh, my goddamn outhouse blues.  I think that went through, too.  That may have made it.  Nice.  Wow.  We're pretty lucky to get two in a room.  Yeah.  I think you're two for two today, John. 
[00:24:30]  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, I want to break your record.  What's John think about group sex?  Oh, no.  It depends on the group.  I don't know.  What do you want me to say?  How many do you want to do at one time?  What are you talking about?  No, I'm just looking for the gangbangs.  Oh.  Hey, John, know how we get away with stuff on our show?  We just use the alphabet.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You use the F word?  I'm wondering.  You could say F, and you could say F are in the A. 
[00:25:00]  Ah, you can see.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  F are in the A, pull it out, C all over her face.  We don't know what that means, see?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's good.  So maybe we could try that with one of your songs.  I don't know.  Yank my doodle, it's a dandy.  Yank my doodle till I die.  Make that wiener shoot some fireworks.  Just like the fourth of...  Knock, knock!  Who's that?  Krispy Kreme.  Krispy Kreme who? 
[00:25:30]  Krispy Kreme is what the slut has on her face when she wakes up the next morning.  After the gangbang.  We got to sit down.  We got the gangbang.  How about this one?  Knock, knock!  Who's there?  In sync.  In sync who?  In sync is where she spits whatever little she doesn't swallow.  After the gangbang.  I can sit down.  We got the gangbang.  Did I make it?  I don't know.  Hell, yeah.  That made it.  We're going to find out. 
[00:26:00]  We had to make it.  We don't know what he was talking about.  Yeah, right.  It could be anything.  It in sync's a group, right?  We are three for three.  All right.  Yeah.  Now people are going to just start saying, oh, Joe and Valby sold out.  Yeah, right.  Three for three.  That's never happened.  See, you keep it vague and no one knows what you're singing about.  All right.  Yeah.  Those are perfect examples.  Krispy Kreme.  Let me go to Eric.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Mr. Valby. 
[00:26:30]  Yes, sir.  Yes.  I like that.  I know you did an Elvis Presley medley at one time.  Uh, yeah.  I don't.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, isn't that originally from Mr. Floyd?  How much do you envy Soupy Sales?  Tell me.  Oh, my God.  He's trying to say that you rip off Soupy Sales.  You know, when you threw a pie in my face when you came in, I was thinking the same thing.  Soupy Sales. 
[00:27:00]  Wow, that's great.  That's good.  That's good.  I was trying to remember the Elvis songs, and I don't remember doing any of them, you know?  Dr. Dirty.  Maybe Soupy Sales did that.  He's an original.  Soupy Sales.  Man.  People got nerve.  Every time they hear something funny, it's got to be ripped off from someone else.  That's right.  Jesus.  There's supposed to be only 15 or 16 jokes, and all of them are a form of that.  That's exactly it.  Hey, Doug, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Let's see if John Valdez can go match the Met Street and go four for four. 
[00:27:30]  Now, Doug, all those other songs made it through, right?  Yeah.  It's been pretty cool.  All right, cool.  And the best is when he laughs at his own songs, though.  It's hysterical.  No, that's good.  He's laughing, then you make him laugh more.  That's the beer.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  All right.  I met her down in Florida, just on a night like this.  I'd been drinking lots of beer and had to take a f***.  I knew that if I stopped to talk, that'd be when nature calls.  But I took a chance and f***ed my pants and saw my f***ing m***s. 
[00:28:00]  She said her name was Tammy.  She loved to give me m***s.  By now, my m***s were clammy, but my D was big and red.  You can't say the B word?  The B word?  You're about four dumps deep into that already.  You can't say the P word.  You can't say the D word.  Yeah, the P is... 
[00:28:30]  That one didn't make it.  Tinkle.  Tinkle didn't make it.  The P word for tinkle.  Really?  Yeah, that's one of the ones that are...  You can't say P in vinegar?  Right.  Oh, that's one of the seven dirty words.  Wow, sorry, very sorry.  That's all, no, you were doing very good.  Three out of four.  Three out of four.  Now we're back to the starting line.  Oh, that's...  We were doing so well.  We were.  Yes, we were.  Here we go.  Torn between two lovers, my wife and my own left hand. 
[00:29:00]  Believe me, on my wedding night, this is not what I had planned.  Born and torn between two lovers, but if I had to choose, the sad truth is my heaven  wife would lose.  I think we're back on track again.  Yes, we're back to one. 
[00:29:30]  I'm getting ready on the button every time you start playing that keyboard.  I bet our dump guy is sweating.  Yeah.  Let's see if John could do another one here and get it past the sensors.  Oh, yeah.  What was I going to do?  Midnight last evening, out by the pond, my fairy godmother went nuts with her wand.  She effed up the words. 
[00:30:00]  She was half in the bag.  Now the pumpkin's a sumo who dresses in drag.  Chim-chiminy, chim-chiminy, chim-chim-chir-ee.  I got the b****s of a rhino, the D of a flea.  Chim-chiminy, chim-chiminy, chim-chim-chir-oo.  I can see by your face that she effed you up, too.  I may not have much, but it's enough to have for you.  See the alphabet works? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a good way around it.  Oh, yeah.  Until they take that away from us.  I always thought that they were actually censoring thoughts.  You know, in Chicago, they tell me that if you say anything with insertion,  like I was trying to do some girl who had two thumbs up from Siskel and Eber.  Right.  And they wouldn't let me do that.  No.  But some places they do.  Like, you guys don't care about thumbs up.  No.  No, I don't think so.  That's how good your legal team is.  Right.  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  Right up until we get in trouble for it.  Yeah.  Tom, what's up?  25 years.  Big fan.  Dr. John.  Seen you up in Rochester many times.  Still have the vinyl records.  Wow.  How about trying Barnacle Bill?  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  I don't know about that.  Use the bees.  Who's that knocking at my door?  Who's that knocking at my door?  Who's that knocking at my door?  Said the fair young man.  Well.  Open the door, you effing whores. 
[00:31:30]  Said Barnacle Bill was a sailor.  Open the door, you effing whores.  Said Barnacle Bill was a sailor.  Shall we go to the hills?  The hell with the dancing down with your pants.  Said Barnacle Bill was a sailor.  The hell with the dancing down with your pants.  Said Barnacle Bill was a sailor.  What's that thing between your legs?  What's that thing between your legs?  Is only the f*** gonna eat at Barnacle Bill?  A sailor.  Only the f*** gonna eat at Barnacle Bill?  Well, you want to try a semi-sick one? 
[00:32:00]  Yay!  What's that dripping down with your legs?  Well, shut up, you dope.  My rubber broke at Barnacle Bill.  A sailor.  Shut up, you dope.  My rubber broke at Barnacle Bill.  I better stop there before I get in trouble.  Oh, you won't get in trouble.  You will.  I just got the signal.  That one didn't make it, John.  Yeah, a couple of thoughts on that one.  Really?  Damn it.  Are you a little surprised?  I actually am. 
[00:32:30]  I thought I used all the right Epsons.  So did I.  I'm not too familiar with this.  Yeah.  You know, I just say what I want.  That one was a little too obvious.  Like the others weren't.  You're gonna ruin it.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, I was wondering if John could do a couple of limericks.  Limericks are always nice.  Sure.  A classic.  There once was a young man from Stamboul  who had red spots all over his tool. 
[00:33:00]  He rushed to the dock who looked at his seat.  Just wipe off the lipstick, you fool.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Your mother can stall a lawnmower with her bush hair.  Another verse works.  While I'll be around by my willy.  Oh, there are once the priests...  And I better not do a religious.  Oh, religion's fine.  All right, there went to the priest from Dundee 
[00:33:30]  who hung a nun's sea on a tree.  He grabbed her bare ass and performed a high mass  that even the Pope came to see.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Your sister's in charge of the...  Oh, my God!  Wait, wait, wait, wait!  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  No, no, no, no.  John, you're doing so well.  That is so funny.  You can't say that. 
[00:34:00]  Why not?  What the hell?  We're all just getting along.  It was working on nice.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought that was...  You can't say...  You could say your sister's in charge of the splooge towels.  Oh, that was it.  But the C word for byproduct,  very frowned upon.  Very frowned upon.  That's very, very bad.  Ant and I know the rules, John.  He's like a crack at it.  That is so funny, yeah.  He can only stay off in so long.  Like Robert Downey Jr. 
[00:34:30]  You can't help yourself.  I know he's staggering down the street in his underwear.  My God.  God, that's funny.  Johnny, why don't you try...  I know we have to get you out of here in a few minutes,  but why don't you try another one?  You want to let me see if I can think of one  that I might be able to...  Sweet pie.  I was out on a date in my daddy's car.  I picked her up in a Wanta bar.  My finger F'd her C. 
[00:35:00]  She didn't let out a peep.  I had my C in her throat to be.  I was f***ing her bass.  He started to spit.  It's hard to do, isn't it?  I lost the thought in all those alphabets there.  It's hard to do.  It is.  Where, oh, where can my...  How about there once was a young lady from Arden 
[00:35:30]  who asked off a man in a garden.  He said, my dear Flo, where does all that stuff go?  And she said, I beg your pardon?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Your grandma gives gummers to plumbers.  Must make me another verse worse.  Walsh, hey, a round button.  Opie and Anthony on the radio. 
[00:36:00]  They're gonna make you laugh with the crazy show.  But one thing I saw made my pecker go ouch.  Opie doing an anthy on the lesbian couch.  Opie and Anthony, the king and queen of New York.  Yeah.  Okay, terrific.  They beat that one out, too.  They should have.  Where's the dumb guy when we need him?  Yeah, baby.  No, no, no. 
[00:36:30]  Wrong!  Try again, dumbass!  You bastard.  Very good.  Right.  We have to get you out?  Yeah, we gotta go out and set up and do all that kind of stuff.  All right, now this video that was shot in the studio with us and you.  Yeah.  Where can people get it?  They can get it on johnvalbee.com or, you know, we ought to set something with you guys  where they can get it here, you know?  Oh, oh, oh.  You know, so as soon as we play a commercial, we'll talk about it.  We'll figure it out?  Okay.  Thank you, John.  Thank you.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:37:00]  1027 WNEW.  Let's go to Susan.  Hi, Susan.  How are you?  Hi, how are you?  Good.  What's up?  I, that's just an ad.  Well, we know.  He hung up on me before.  You sound like a guy.  You sound like a little kid.  I'm on a cell phone and I'm walking.  You're, where are you walking?  I'm walking from work to my house.  In what, uh, what town? 
[00:37:30]  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Yep.  And what do you want to do for us today?  I wanted to play, I guess it's my pants.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Can you find a bush somewhere?  I don't need a bush.  That's the whole, uh, object of the game, Opie.  Well, you want to do it as you're walking to your house?  Well, you know, it's where I'm walking, like, it's a park, but there's a lot of trees.  All right, why don't you find a tree you can, uh, duck behind?  I don't need to duck.  I'm just going to keep walking.  You're going to, you're going to do it as you walk?  Sure.  That's, uh, that's different. 
[00:38:00]  That might, uh, might hinder the performance.  Okay, I'll stop walking.  See, for the up and smoke tickets, I'll stop walking.  All right, yeah, stop walking.  Get behind a tree.  Okay.  There's something very dirty about this.  Yes.  Behind a tree.  What are you wearing there?  I wouldn't.  What are you wearing, Susan?  My work uniform.  What is that?  I can't say.  Like a skirt?  Uh, no.  Oh, pants?  Those industrial pants?  No.  I just don't want people to find out that I'll get in a lot of trouble.  Well, what line, what line of work, what industry are you in? 
[00:38:30]  Fast food.  I'm a lifeguard.  Wow.  A lifeguard?  So you're wearing a bathing suit?  Yes.  Yes, sir.  And you're coming back from the pool in the park that you work at in Staten Island.  See, good girl.  I'm giving it away.  Boy, that was, that was tough to figure out.  You could have.  I was calling Mark from the lifeguard chair when Mark hung up on me.  Thank you, Einstein.  There's not too many pools out here, okay?  All right.  Well, have you found a tree? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Describe the scene.  There's no one on an empty beach.  And me with my red cell phone.  All right.  And all right.  So you're going to like, what, pull the bathing suit aside so you can get to the area?  Yeah, it's big.  It's big?  The bathing suit is an extra large.  They only come in one size.  All right.  What kind of body do you have, Susan?  I'm beautiful.  You're beautiful.  They all say that.  What do you look like?  I'm 18.  Blue eyes, brown hair. 
[00:39:30]  5'7", 125.  What else?  Like, size two pants.  Size two pants.  They're beautiful.  What about the top?  They're good.  They're good?  Good to go?  Yeah.  Medium size?  Medium.  Meanie knees?  No.  All right.  No, about a C.  All right.  Now, are you sitting down on the ground behind a tree?  Do I really need to sit?  Not really.  No, not really.  Okay.  Just describe what you're doing. 
[00:40:00]  I'm standing on a bunch of, like, I don't know what these are, like, weeds all around me.  And there's a path that goes through them, and I was walking, and I stopped.  Someone's saying there's no park on Staten Island.  If you make me say the name of my park, I will get fired.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Or I'll get made fun of that.  Oh, and he's saying Susan's line, no park on Staten Island, with pool.  All right.  He's right.  There's no pool.  I'm a beach lifeguard, and I'm walking on the beach. 
[00:40:30]  Ah.  Awful.  But I didn't want to say that.  All right.  So you're on a beach.  Yes.  And you're walking, and there's no one around.  No one.  All right, Susan.  Let's get to What's in My Pants.  Let me play the theme song as you get ready to play, okay?  Okay.  Okay.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants? 
[00:41:00]  How would you like to roll by a roll?  Huh?  Let's see why Nate, Anthony.  Ah.  Okay, Susan.  So what's going on?  You're bathing suits to the side now?  Yep.  All right.  You're on a beach somewhere in Staten Island?  Yep.  Okay.  You want to rub the phone up and down for us, please?  Sure.  Okay.  18-year-old girl.  Can you hear it? 
[00:41:30]  Wow.  It was a little low, but if you could do it again, up and down.  It was low, but very low.  You want to know why?  Because I don't know where the microphone is, but I'm going to find it.  All right.  Yeah.  Find the microphone.  She found the microphone.  That's it.  Okay.  All right.  That's up and down?  Yeah.  Now side to side.  Got it?  I love this game.  And now a slow circular motion over the entire region. 
[00:42:00]  All right.  There's definitely something there.  Yeah.  Okay.  You can play along at home, by the way, if you're in the car.  Now remember, don't tell us the answer until we ask you.  Okay.  Okay.  Opie?  Well, I think I need to hear side to side one more time.  Yeah, that's important.  If you will.  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is tough.  And up and down one more time.  Up and down again, if you could. 
[00:42:30]  Wow.  Boy, this is a tricky one.  You know, I really wish I knew what it heard, but I hear you play all the time.  Like, you know, I want to know what my hair sounds like.  Okay.  Well, we're going to tell you in a second here.  Anthony?  I think I just need a round, a round one.  If you could, just, just.  Okay.  Do you anything.  Okay.  Hold on.  We're going to need some of that wax stuff that we were talking about earlier. 
[00:43:00]  You good?  Yeah.  Hello?  Yeah, yeah.  We're thinking here.  It's very difficult.  I'm ready.  What are you saying?  A trim triangle.  All right.  He's saying a trim triangle.  I, you know something?  I'm going to go with.  Everyone's screaming in their cars.  They know it.  You know something?  It was a little too uniform. 
[00:43:30]  I'm going to say wood floor.  I, I, I, yeah.  Yeah, I know.  I'm getting looks here.  An 18-year-old girl with a wood floor?  But I'm going to say wood floor, I, I, I, and I know I'm getting abused for it, but there's  just something about the sound.  All right.  Hold on.  Jeff, the gay guy from Jersey.  He plays every time when we do this.  Okay.  I'm going to try this again.  I'm batting 750 in the last eight tries.  She has a pool rack full of Afro hair.  You hear the purr in the background?  There's a seagull. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, that was his guess before.  Yeah.  Okay.  My real answer after listening, wood floor with five o'clock shadow.  That's Jeff, the gay guy.  Come on.  Okay.  Put your bathing suit back on.  Put your bathing suit back on.  How are you walking?  Yeah, I know.  The seagulls are following us.  The seagulls are chasing us.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  So fired.  So fired I am.  I'm a disgrace to the lifestyle community. 
[00:44:30]  It's turning into a scene from, uh, from birds.  Alfred Hitchcock's birds.  At least you know I was mighty.  I'm not lying.  I'm looking at the beach.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wow.  How funny was that to hear the seagulls following us? 
[00:45:00]  The seagulls.  Okay.  All right.  Are we ready?  Yeah.  Jeff, the gay guy, says wood floor with five o'clock shadow.  I said a trimmed triangle, and Anthony is going with a wood floor.  I'm saying wood floor.  Wood floor.  All right.  Susan.  Uh-huh.  Do I have to stump you to win?  Huh?  No, no.  Okay, because...  We don't want...  No.  You got it right.  Who got it right?  You did.  Triangle?  It's very short, but it's trim, and I have very nice hygiene, and I don't want to hear 
[00:45:30]  about that.  All right.  Got to give it to you.  I'm hearing those seagulls still, though.  That is hilarious.  All right.  No, that's not...  Stop it.  God damn.  Some things you just can't plan on this show.  Girl walking down the beach naked, and you hear seagulls falling.  That's...  That's funnier than the whole Psycho Mark thing. 
[00:46:00]  Okay.  Susan, congratulations.  Thanks for playing What's in My Pants.  Hold on, we're going to give you something very cool, okay?  All right.  Thank you.  There she goes, Susan.  Somewhere on a beach in Staten Island, Anthony.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants? 
[00:46:30]  All right.  A little beach version.  Yeah.  Guess what's in my pants?  Yeah, that was the beach version.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  You want to give us a call?  877-692-1027.  In the studio, Richard Jenny.  Also in the studio.  Starker Patty. 
[00:47:00]  46-year-old virgin.  And Ron Jeremy.  Ron Jeremy, who felt up Patty just moments ago.  Made her ting go.  I still have a liftoff.  Are you?  Still excited about it.  See?  There's something kind of exciting about that.  You know, if she had like a couple of hundred guys just broke the Houston record or something  like that, it'd be different, you know?  But she's so...  Richard, am I wrong about this?  Very innocent.  She's never done anything.  Man, Ron, you are a pig.  Kind of a pig.  Yeah, I guess I am.  Come on.  I guess I am, you know?  I want you to have sex with Ron just so I can see the numbers change above his penis. 
[00:47:30]  That McDonald's sign that you have there in your pubic hair.  The number changes on her, too.  Yeah.  One.  One.  One.  Imagine you wait all this time.  Zero to one.  You wait and wait for the right guy all this time and Ron Jeremy's your first.  Look, guys.  Tom Cruise wasn't available.  No, Brad Slate was busy, you know?  And with that tool, you're going to ruin her for the rest of her life.  It's like being afraid to drive, but you finally decide to get into a top fuel dragster. 
[00:48:00]  You know?  You know?  That's what it would be.  I like these.  You know?  Yeah?  This is good.  This is good.  It's better than that 87-year-old jokes before, you know?  All right, Stalker Patty.  Yeah.  We told you to come down to the studio because we have a huge surprise for you, right?  Yeah.  Ron, if you will, could you stand up?  Oh, I got...  Yeah, I have your...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Don't let her know.  Don't let her know anything.  I'm standing up.  Okay.  Patty, we got you a gift.  Yeah.  I swear to God, we got you a gift. 
[00:48:30]  Patty, who is your favorite, favorite band?  You two.  Right.  Okay.  We got a gift for you.  What?  But it's on Ron Jeremy right now.  So, the good news, the good news and the bad news.  The good news is you got this band you can check out.  The bad news, you have to go by my pants to get the tickets out.  You mean you got you two tickets down here?  Right there.  Remember...  A little to the side. 
[00:49:00]  If you really move your hand properly, you may not glaze against it.  Remember about 20 minutes ago, you refused to touch Ron Jeremy?  Yeah.  We have just upped the ante.  And I'm still depressed over that.  Upped the ante.  Are these in the loge?  They're right here, honey.  If these are in the loge, I'll go in his pants.  See, look.  On the outside, see, look.  Here, put your hand right there.  That's the outside of the tickets.  See right there?  Those are the tickets.  But I suppose you have to go inside the pants to fill them out.  So, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, Patty. 
[00:49:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh, I...  Okay.  Every girl has their place.  She didn't want anything to do with Ron Jeremy's blood.  Look, she's now reaching like you.  Ready to reach.  If you're really careful, you can avoid glazing there.  It's Schmeckle.  I get to see Bono, right?  You'll see Bono, right?  Yeah, you'll see that in two more seconds.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We're not ready yet.  Not yet, Patty.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I get to hear one.  Really put him in a good spot, Ron. 
[00:50:00]  Put him in a good spot.  As he's really, really careful she can get around it, but it won't get me easy.  You know what?  He's packing, don't you?  Hold on.  Wait, wait.  Okay, he's okay.  I'm okay.  He's not exactly popping right now, but he's going to work him a little bit, Ron.  Ron, you want us to give you a couple minutes?  Well, the envelope will fall out if I do that.  If he sticks straight out, it's gone, you know?  The envelope hits the floor.  This is great.  This proves a point. 
[00:50:30]  Even Patty.  You're still going to get a handful of Schmeckle, no matter what you're doing.  Sorry, that's Jewish.  Come on, Richard.  Get out of here.  Patty.  All right.  It's yours.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Here goes stalker Patty reaching into Ron Jeremy to dig out the YouTube ticket.  I know it's for the tickets, not for me.  I realize that, honey.  Don't worry.  Patty, slowly reach in.  Don't hurt Ron.  Oh, she has no nails.  Good.  Don't.  She's just like a pig.  She just looked.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm not wearing any underpants either. 
[00:51:00]  Patty, you're not.  You're also.  You're also not allowed to look so you can pick them out.  You have to turn your head and reach in.  Hold on.  You know what would make this better?  Hold on.  What, Opie?  You know what would make this better?  Get a blindfold.  The edge.  Blindfold.  Blindfold.  Blindfold.  Blindfold, Patty.  Get a T-shirt.  Honey, if he gets a b***h, don't worry.  It'll go away.  It's no big deal.  This is great.  Stalker Patty even has a prize.  Huh? 
[00:51:30]  A prize.  I blew the game, Opie.  How were you going to play it?  Well, we didn't want to tell her what was in his pants, but that's okay.  Oh, you would have grabbed in there if you didn't know it was U2 tickets?  I doubt that.  It works this way as well.  We offered her before, and she turned it down.  It's okay.  We're just getting a blindfold.  We're going to get a blindfold, so that way she can't pull the pants out and then look  and just grab the tickets.  Right.  Listen, Mark McGuire and Sammy Sosa sell their balls for millions.  This is no big deal.  She's going to have to rummage around in there.  I made Richard Jenny laugh. 
[00:52:00]  I'm doing good.  God knows what she'll find.  I steal most of his jokes.  All right.  All right.  Stinky has the blindfold.  Let's blindfold.  Patty, take your glasses off.  46-year-old virgin.  Patty.  Stalker Patty.  The glasses are off.  Why don't you get eye surgery?  Oh, yes.  I can't afford it.  Focus.  You know, look at it.  Honey, he's telling a jock supporter around your eyes right now.  That's a jock strap.  He just put it around your eyes.  The blindfold is on.  Steve is videotaping this for foundry music.  Patty, can you see?  No.  Very good. 
[00:52:30]  Now.  I see bottom.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Hold on.  Should we spin?  Yeah, spin Patty around.  Spin Patty around a little bit.  Spin Patty around a little bit.  Hold on.  Yeah, get the headphones off.  Oh, now you're not going to be able to because they're inside the blindfold.  But we've got to read.  Great.  You can spin on a little more.  All right.  Let's get the headphones off her head.  Put the blindfold back on.  That's it, Ron.  Work that thing.  Work.  You should see.  Make sure it's coming.  Okay, good.  Patty has never.  We're going to do it again.  I've got to do it right.  You know what I'm saying?  Patty has never. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, no.  Never.  Never.  She's never had any kind of contact with that part of a man in her life.  Now I'm dizzy.  Patty's getting dizzy.  Now I'm dizzy.  I can't believe it.  I feel like I'm on a merry-go-round.  Oh, you're going to be on a merry-go-round.  I can't believe it anymore, please.  Okay, the ticket's away from you.  There you go.  All right.  You follow my voice.  Hello, hello, hello.  Okay.  There she is.  She's on the stomach.  Oh, my God.  There we go.  She's now touching Ron's stomach. 
[00:53:30]  Ron's stomach.  She's going in his pants.  She's going in.  She's going in.  She went down Ron Jeremy's pants.  Ron, how much did she feel?  She glazed along the side of the swamp.  She brushed the side of the legendary Ron Jeremy's swamp.  Here's the bad part.  Oh, my God.  John Tesh at Red Rocks.  She's my favorite fan.  Are you more excited about you two or that you finally touched man junk in all these years? 
[00:54:00]  She's got it right to the side, man.  She's pretty good at that.  I don't think she's a very good fan.  I don't know what I...  I don't know.  I brushed up against something, but I don't know what it was.  It was filet of...  Did she give you a little...  Tell you what.  It was a pound of beef and a bucket of balls.  She's done this before.  Tell you what we're going to do.  We're going to upgrade your tickets, Patty, to the front row, but...  You want a front row upgrade?  Open wide.  Oh, my God.  Wow. 
[00:54:30]  Look how excited she is.  That's only one ticket.  Here comes the second ticket.  She's crying because you finally touched man junk.  I'm going to see the edge.  You just saw the edge.  You brushed the edge.  I back to the edge.  Patty, what did it feel like on your hands?  I just felt a little hair.  He is hairy.  She went right to the side of it.  Yeah, she had a little grip there.  Yeah.  You didn't give him a hand?  She did it so fast.  I'm not sure what it was or what part it was. 
[00:55:00]  It's called schlong, Patty.  She put the things back there again.  You should have seen how many women that has invaded.  Hey, guys, now...  Now, listen, guys, now...  You have a $10 bill.  She buys her drinks with that.  Oh, Patty, how about some money for the parking and some beers?  What do you think?  You need a little money?  What do you think?  You want to fish down there for another $10?  But it's got to be right underneath the Jeremy Yam bag.  You want the $10 for the drinks?  Yeah, let's get a collection up.  I don't have to park, but I'll have the $10 for coffee. 
[00:55:30]  There we go, guys.  Where should that be?  Ron, she works at McDonald's, so this is a big deal.  Where's the $10?  Don't be afraid.  Just pretend you're the croc hunter and it's sweet, sweet.  I'm so happy.  Look, it's going into a death row.  Look at that bugger.  His spices have been invited, and now he's going to attack.  I'd like to see a fish for...  I got $10.  I got $20.  How about you give her $40? 
[00:56:00]  Let's see her fish that out.  All right.  I'll close it.  Turn around, Patty.  Wait.  Turn around.  Oh, Patty, look at this.  Back to be yours.  Look at her.  Patty, and $20 to enjoy the night out of seeing you, too.  Yeah.  How about that, Patty?  Yeah, Bono.  Hey, Patty.  Whatever.  Here you go, Patty.  All right.  Now, where is it?  Ron, Ron, wait a minute.  I don't want it to be this easy this time.  It's tough for this time.  Is it really like we need it right by the taint? 
[00:56:30]  It's tough for this time.  Is it?  Okay.  Now, is it a blindfolded again?  Yeah, Ron, Ron, wedge that in there.  If I was gay, I'd be sticking where the sun don't fly.  Ron, not.  Put it in that place that when, in one of your movies, when the guys see that certain part,  they go, Jesus Christ, and I wanted to see some chicks, not that.  The bob shot, you know.  Put it in the bob area.  Here, it's all yours, honey.  Go ahead.  Back of...  Back of the yam bag shot.  She's pretty good at this.  Oh, yeah? 
[00:57:00]  She's good at...  Patty...  I think she said...  She said...  Oh, my God.  Hey, honey, go to it, honey.  Jim, what are you laughing at?  All right.  Uh-oh, wait a minute.  The idea of this is great.  All right.  Hold on, Patty.  Patty is now going down his pants.  Go slow, honey.  Go too fast.  Her hand is down.  Oh, my God!  She just pulled her hand out.  She pulled her hand out like a feather.  It's there, honey.  It's there.  I swear to God.  She pulled her hand out of there so quick.  It's under the schlong.  You'll find it.  Patty, go ahead. 
[00:57:30]  You've got to dig it out.  She thought it was a roll of quarters.  Patty, go get it.  You're too low.  Too low.  Got to go higher.  Too low.  Go up.  Got to go higher, honey.  It's underneath...  I swear to God.  It's like something's nipping her.  She pulls her hand out of there so quick.  Patty.  Patty.  Give Patty the mic a second.  Patty.  It's not going to bite you.  Patty, what are you feeling?  What are you feeling right now?  It scared me. 
[00:58:00]  That's what a lot of women say.  She got a grip on it this time.  Did she?  Patty, what does that feel like?  Weird.  Is the 20 still in there?  Oh, it's still there.  It's still in there.  Yeah, it's there.  Patty, you're going to have to fish underneath.  You were close there.  Give it another try, honey.  The deepest, darkest.  Now that you've turned your hand on it, honey, it's no big deal anymore.  Yeah.  Try the undercarriage.  Second fiddle, honey.  Get in there, Patty.  Let's go for it.  Keep going.  Wait.  You're close.  A little lower.  A little lower.  Wait.  To the right.  Okay.  There you go.  Wait. 
[00:58:30]  To your right.  Other way.  Other way.  Other way.  A little lower.  A little lower.  She's got her hand on Roger.  Keep going a little more.  She's killing me.  Okay.  Now curl up a little bit.  It's right there.  Go up.  She just pulled her hand out again.  She squealed and pulled her hand out.  She makes contact with Fletch.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on, Patty.  What's going on?  I've done a lot of radio shows in my day. 
[00:59:00]  This really takes the cake.  Isn't this something?  All right, Patty.  46-year-old version Patty.  Patty.  Yeah.  What's the problem?  No, it's just...  It's called Ron Jeremy.  Yeah.  She filled all the right spots.  Get in there.  All right.  Here we go.  Get it out of the way, and it's underneath waiting for you.  This is for 20 bucks, so you can enjoy the YouTube show.  You've got to get it out of the way, honey.  Patty, after you do this, we're going to show you where that's been.  Roll a few videos.  You've got to go underneath it.  You can't escape touching it. 
[00:59:30]  I don't see it.  He's sticking around in there.  You've got to get the slum out of the way, honey.  Higher.  Higher.  Go get it, Patty.  Come on.  Go get it, Patty.  Go get it, Patty.  She's pulled her hand out again.  Patty.  I'm not going to leave you for her.  I'll put it around here.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  She's got to get it.  She's scared stiff of the nutsack.  Patty, Patty, you're going to have to lift up where it's hidden.  You have to lift up.  All right, wait.  You have to lift the...  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  You're going to bleep that. 
[01:00:00]  Hold on.  Patty, Patty.  What?  Patty.  What is the problem?  Yeah, what's the problem, Patty?  I don't know why.  I've never done anything like this before in my life.  Neither has Ron for 20 bucks.  This is a new one for both of us.  Neither has Andrew Jackson.  All right, she's back in there, Andrew.  She's back in.  To your left.  My left is this way.  Yes, go to your left.  That's it.  That's it.  Now, go underneath.  You're there.  Go a little more underneath.  You've got to get it out of the way, honey.  You can't avoid it.  Come on, honey.  You have to go underneath.  Come on, grab.  Don't be afraid of it.  It's not going to bite. 
[01:00:30]  Just nibble.  Come on, Patty.  You're real close.  So close.  Keep going.  Patty's like on a...  Up.  Right there.  Under there.  A little more.  Patty's...  You've got to use...  Oh, my God.  Why does it look like it's got strudel icing on it?  Oh, that was not like me.  That's a winner.  It's perfectly clean.  Oh, my God.  There's nothing more. 
[01:01:00]  Well, there's nothing I have that she hasn't grabbed.  Let's put it that way.  Yeah.  Patty.  I feel so much closer now.  Don't you?  Patty, that was the first time you've ever been in that area, right?  How did it feel?  How did it feel?  Weird.  It felt a little weird.  Would you ever let a guy fish anything out of your bottoms?  No?  Not yet.  Tomorrow.  How about for another 20?  This keeps going.  Patty.  For another 20.  If we put a 20 down the front of your pants and Ron fishes it out, we'll give it to you also. 
[01:01:30]  This keeps going until she's bleeding from the blood.  And he's behind her going, do you want popcorn or don't you?  Do you want refreshments or not?  Make up your mind.  Stinky, go get my wallet.  Go get my wallet.  I got a 20.  I got one.  You'll pay me later.  Okay.  Yeah.  You want another 20 bucks, Patty?  So far, she's fished out.  You two tickets.  By the time we get to $100, it's going to be an eight-man interracial dwarf. 
[01:02:00]  Right.  Dwarf.  Here it is now.  She's going to break Houston's record by the time we leave today.  You want to pass that on over?  There you go.  That's the clean one.  Okay.  All right.  Patty, you put it on your pants real deep.  What you got to do is put it in an area, the same type of area Ron had his 20 in.  It's got to be right there.  Look, I'm manicured.  See?  Manicured.  Don't put it in the front.  It's got to be right on the undercarriage, if you know what I mean.  And not interfered by any clothing or anything.  And then Ron will go in there and grab the 20 out, and that 20 will also be yours. 
[01:02:30]  I'm shaking.  You've got to stand up.  You've got to stand up, honey.  You'll really be shaking later.  You've got to stand up.  You've got to...  Should I kiss the back of your neck when I do this?  All right.  Yeah, give her the reach around.  Get her with the reach around.  Oh, not the reach.  Wait, wait.  Turn around.  You don't want Ron to know where you're putting it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I won't look, guys.  But, Norton, you make sure she's putting it way under there.  All right, Patty, you've got to stand up.  I'm not looking.  Patty, that's got to go right on the Mason-Dixon.  You know what I mean?  Take the blindfold off. 
[01:03:00]  Go ahead.  You've got to go under the panties.  Right on the equator.  I'm not looking.  I don't care.  I've got to put it down.  Deep down.  Deep down.  No, Patty, that's still in front.  You've got to go right under.  Underneath.  Under.  Make believe it's a Maxi.  Oh, my God.  Flying on the wings of a Maxi.  Patty, 46-year-old virgin.  Let's blindfold Ron.  Okay.  It's only fair.  It's only fair, Ron.  It's only fair.  If I'm worth my stuff, I should be able to find it.  Really?  Where's the blindfold?  Where's the blindfold?  The front can.  Count Ron's rings. 
[01:03:30]  Make sure they're all there when he pulls his hands back out.  I would have to care of that.  Oh, you took them off.  I don't want to lose them down there.  Of course not.  We're blindfolding, Ron.  Patty has hidden a $20 bill.  Yeah.  Right on the undercarriage.  We're talking right where every automotive needs rust-proofing.  The 46-year-old virgin Patty.  Okay.  All right.  Patty, you ready for this?  All right.  All right, Jim.  Jim, make sure you're Mike Patty.  All right.  Ron now searching. 
[01:04:00]  Going down on the belly.  He is now finding the panty line.  There he goes.  He is...  Oh, my God.  Whoa!  Patty is freaking out.  I'm not here yet.  Oh, my God.  Patty can't believe it.  She's in shock.  Ron Jeremy's hand firmly down her pants.  She's buckled over, doubling over her mouth agape.  Oh, my God.  Have you ever seen Patty like this? 
[01:04:30]  This is unbelievable.  She's like...  Dude, she's enjoying this.  She just had an off.  I think she just owed.  Oh, my God.  I'm almost there.  He's almost got it, Patty.  He's almost got it.  You've got to stand up.  Nice job, nice job, nice job.  He's almost got it, Patty.  You're going to U2.  You're going to have $40 spending money, Patty.  I'm so surprised Ron can't find it. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, Ron.  You can't find it?  I thought you were an expert at this.  Oh, my God.  I think you lost the ring that time.  Oh, she's twitching.  She's twitching.  This is one small step for a man.  She's on the floor.  No.  Oh, no.  Did you get it?  He got it.  He got it. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, my God.  Hey, wait a minute.  That's 210.  Stop taking my phone.  She made change.  Hi, Richard.  What happened there?  Patty.  Hey, wait a minute.  I certainly earned that.  Now, how much will you give me if I smell Jeremy's fingers?  Now, Patty, I've got to ask you, Patty, how did that feel?  Where?  Something weird again.  Listen, I've got to say in all fairness, I wasn't too much there, but I could tell she 
[01:06:00]  was a little on the excited stage.  Is that true?  Patty, did you feel a little excitement there, Patty?  Be honest.  How do I say it was delicately?  She wasn't totally dry.  Let's put it out.  You got a tingly feeling?  Yeah.  She did.  Oh, that's a tingle.  The root of my mouth.  The root of your mouth.  That's where it starts.  Well, Ron can take care of that.  I was going to say, we have a cure for that.  There's a protein paste that takes care of the...  She wasn't totally unexcited.  Let's put it that way. 
[01:06:30]  You can tell, right?  Yes.  I think she might be sticking to the seat as we speak.  Patty, now, did that feel kind of good and kind of different?  What do you think?  Patty?  It felt different.  Different, but was it good or different bad?  Different, I don't know what.  Different than a different denomination?  Have you ever had that done to you?  No.  No.  And it's Ron Jeremy, the first guy to touch it.  Man, are you going to be disappointed after today? 
[01:07:00]  I think we should all join hands and sing We Are the World.  Right.  Absolutely.  I cannot believe the first person to touch her peach was Ron Jeremy.  How often has she been in the studio?  She's been coming in here for three years, just about.  Yeah, but this time she really did come in here.  But I'm bummed.  Thank you.  No, I'm telling you, she was not dry, honest to goodness.  Wow.  Get those pictures up on the website immediately.  Yeah, and usually virgins are like that, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Sure.  They get sent on very easily.  Oh, God. 
[01:07:30]  Fantastic.  Well, Patty, you not only got U2 tickets and $40 to spend at the show, but you got...  Now, guys, now, guys, now, let me ask you this.  If she puts another bill down there, and I attach crazy glue to the...  Okay, just kidding.  Patty, you are...  You felt something there that you never felt before, though, right?  Most guys have to come into money.  Fishing for dollars, right?  You felt something you never felt before.  Yeah.  Holy...  And it was kind of exciting. 
[01:08:00]  It was kind of strange.  Do you shave?  I mean, do you shave, like, for the summer, for bathing suits and stuff?  Yeah, I do.  Because it wasn't a big...  It didn't seem like a virginal, you know.  Most virginals usually like a lot of hair.  She did not have that much.  No, she's all ready to go.  You're shaving for bathing suits.  The car's gassed up, pointed in the right direction.  She does not put it in drive.  You've seen her below the waist?  No, no, I haven't.  Yeah, we have.  We got pictures of it.  Totally nude?  Yeah.  She has a nice physique.  Well, it's a photo of me in the whipped cream bikini. 
[01:08:30]  You're very sexy, honey.  Some guys will be very happy when he finally plays a game of hide the bacon with you.  And shoot the sherbet and drain the main vein.  He'll be a very happy fellow.  That's un-effing believable.  Who thought the day would come?  Three years ago, when Patty first came in here, we said, in three years, Ron Jeremy's  going to put his hand down the front of your pants and touch that area.  She would have said no way.  Anybody here would have got except her from the future.  Ron.  You may leave this to you and attack the first homeless guy she sees on the bench. 
[01:09:00]  Ron, you don't even know how great that was.  I was having a good time myself.  Yeah.  Hey, glad to be with assistants.  Rick is previewing some of the pictures.  Nice.  Get those on the website.  Patty, you enter a long, illustrious line of ladies that have had that done to them.  Listen, guys, I'll tell you, I think right now, you could put a dollar there.  I should probably do it for that.  No.  Wow.  I am so amazed that that ever even happened.  For one dollar, you can get her like five sticks of bubble gum. 
[01:09:30]  So what do you say?  Wow.  All right.  We should take a break.  If you pay us 20 bucks, I'll fish for it.  Okay.  Let's take a break and hose off.  Yeah, we got to get Richard Jenning out of here.  He did a great job for us today.  See, Richard, it turned out okay.  It turned out all we're done.  We got off to an obnoxious start and it turned out really well.  May the Lord squat on your life and spray his blessings upon you.  Thanks, Richard.  Richard Jenning.  All right, we got to take a quick break.  We'll be back in just a bit.  The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:10:00]  That doesn't sound so bad.  Ho-ya!  Sucks, man, from wall to wall.  Ho-ya!  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Anthony, you got a great instant feedback here.  Yes.  From Mark, New Jersey.  This morning I was flipping through the channels and I passed by MSNBC.  Yeah.  While Mr. Imus was on.  Imus made his return to radio this morning.  Yeah, I heard about that.  The guy is so feeble now that he wears oxygen to do his show.  Why doesn't the guy put his other foot in the grave? 
[01:10:30]  Let me tell you something.  We do want to welcome Mr. Imus back to the radio airwaves.  But, yeah, I saw the same thing this morning.  It was a mess.  Yeah, perhaps you should start slow and just maybe do the radio show and wait on the CNBC thing until at least there's no medical equipment in the studio.  Right.  I don't think it's a good thing to turn on a radio show on the TV and see medical equipment.  If you want to see a freak show, turn on MSNBC tomorrow morning. 
[01:11:00]  This is what I saw.  I was flipping around and I didn't even know he came back today.  And I'm like, oh, Imus, rerun, whatever.  And I realized quickly that it wasn't rerun because he was talking about the Roger Clemens beanball to Mike Piazza's hat.  Yeah.  What you saw on TV was Imus, he hasn't shaved in about four weeks.  Oh, no.  So really scraggly, gray beard.  The gray beard, yeah.  Pasty white skin, really thin in the face, okay.  Losing weight, being in the hospital, sure.  Wrinkles all over his face. 
[01:11:30]  The biggest cowboy hat I've ever seen.  A big, giant, fag cowboy hat.  It doesn't even fit his head.  It's just huge, okay.  He's got sunglasses on.  And the cowboy hat is pretty much hiding his whole face as he's trying to do radio this morning.  And he looks up and just like that guy said on the instant feedback, he has breathing tubes in his nose.  You know when you see, like, Grandpa in the hospital and he's got the plastic breathing tubes in his nose?  Yeah, the rubber tube goes over your ears and to an oxygen tank.  Right.  That's how he was doing his show today. 
[01:12:00]  No, you know, that's how he was doing his show today.  Oh, my God.  See, now, no one would know this if it was just the radio.  Right.  Why would you agree to that?  God forbid something happens to us and, you know, we have to come back on the radio.  Let's say they're broadcasting a show on TV.  Would you ever agree to have your, you know, sick face on the tube while you're recuperating?  Bernard, wheel the gurney up to the microphone.  Could you do that? 
[01:12:30]  It's 7 o'clock on the Imus in the Morning program.  Hey, McCord, check my pulse.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, do you see the, that, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, wait a minute, I'm feeling a little, uh, fibrillation.  Uh, Bernard.  Oh, Bernard, get the paddles. 
[01:13:00]  Yes.  Uh, 7.05, Imus in the Morning program.  Uh, what?  Could someone, uh, dial up my oxygen a little bit?  And I need a bigger fag cowboy hat.  Uh, some of my, uh, my, uh, neck fat is, uh, turning green.  I need the, uh, bandana.  Wait.  Um, uh, uh, you see the, uh, Met Yanks?  Uh, uh, uh, 7.06, Imus in the Morning program. 
[01:13:30]  Quack, quack.  Uh, what's, uh, so, uh, what was I saying?  Did you see the, uh, Met Yankee games?  Yeah, I think you were talking about, uh, Roger Clemens, Beam, and Mike Piazza.  I'm in, uh, I'm in perfect health.  I'm, uh, uh.  McCord, grab the paddles.  Oh!  7.07, Imus in the Morning. 
[01:14:00]  How the hell am I supposed to do a, uh, program when I'm, uh, dying?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Moby Worm coming to get you, baby.  Yeah.  Do you see the, uh, bandana I have around my neck?  Ah, yes, I do, Mr. Davis.  It's hiding a trach tube.  Jesus.  And, uh, my big fag cowboy hat is hiding, uh, a power generator that's keeping my heart going.  Why does my equipment keep turning on?  Your equipment is malfunctioning, Mr. Imus. 
[01:14:30]  Uh, Bill, what's going on?  Bill.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I was wondering if the, uh, the whole new oxygen tube, that's called the nasal cannula.  But I was wondering if that was one of the props for his characters.  Because doesn't Imus use characters?  Mr. Imus uses characters.  Yeah, Mr. Imus uses characters.  Did you see that this morning?  No, no.  Doing a radio show with the breathing tubes, man.  That's, that's gotta be a real drag.  That's, it's.  It's just brutal.  It is brutal.  It was, it was kind of sad to watch.  Ah. 
[01:15:00]  Maybe he's practicing for like a telethon or something.  Right.  Yeah, send your, uh, money into the Imus in the morning get well program.  Yeah.  All right.  So, you want to talk about Clemens, you said, Mr. Imus.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  And, uh, yeah, I, I, I think it was a, uh, bean ball.  Yeah.  I think he really, uh, you know, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, shut up.  You get me all upset.  Get the paddles, Bernard.  Get the paddles.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  That feels better.  I think I'm, uh, back on rhythm. 
[01:15:30]  Where's my horse?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Destiny.  Come on, Destiny.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There he is, baby.  Someone shoot that goddamn horse.  Oh, Destiny.  Um.  Someone turn my machine.  Ah, thank you.  Goddamn, only five minutes into my program. 
[01:16:00]  I've already had to be revived five times.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh-oh.  What the hell's that?  Double heartbeat.  Someone shot me.  Bernard, grab the paddle.  McCord, grab the paddle.  Get jerked.  Someone, please.  Help me.  Oh.  Ah, that's better.  Imus in the morning.  7.07.  Goddamn, this, this is painful. 
[01:16:30]  I'm, uh, I'm truly a shock jock.  You gotta shock me every goddamn five minutes just to keep me alive, baby.  Yeah.  Oh, Destiny.  Yeah, baby.  Hmm.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Collapsed lung coming to get you.  Well, I'm packing up my big spag cowboy hat and head out west.  Gonna try to ride a horse with my brother.  I'm taking salsa, baby.  Destiny.  And then I'm gonna get bucked off. 
[01:17:00]  And crack some ribs.  Shot me.  Oh, baby.  Yeah.  Snake some tubes down my nose, baby.  Why the hell is a 60-year-old man on a horse?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, shot me.  Bernard, Bernard.  That's what I got.  Cowboy four-two. 
[01:17:30]  He's rocking the real horse.  Oh, baby.  Because I'm, I want to be a cowboy, baby.  Cowboy, baby.  Someone check my colostomy band.  Cowboy, baby.  Yeah, my jaw's wired shut.  Cowboy, baby.  Cowboy, baby.  Riding at night and laying in the hospital for two weeks.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whoa.  Mr. Imus. 
[01:18:00]  Mr. Imus.  Oh, you're there.  Oh, hell, my equipment went.  Oh, my God.  I just noticed those MSNBC cameras are on.  I didn't get to hear his show this morning.  It was, uh, it was painful.  I'll tune in now tomorrow just to see him with the tube.  I encourage everyone to tune in tomorrow.  Check out Imus with the breathing tubes trying to do a radio show. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  It's a prop act.  It's a prop act now, yeah.  Prop act.  He looks like Mr. Burns.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Give us a call.  Toll free, 877-692-1027.  Or you can reach us through the instant feedback, Anthony.  Yes.  On WNEW.com. 
[01:19:00]  And, uh, yeah, that's a good way to do it, right?  Sure, we read them all.  Yes, we do.  And we try to get some of that stuff on the air as well.  Well, we got to say hi to Mario Cantone in the studio.  I'm back with my boys and proud of it.  Mario Cantone.  Back with the boys.  Hello, boys.  Congratulations on your big, big success.  Thank you.  Contracts, security, everything.  Thank you, Mario.  It's really great.  Mario Cantone, of course, beloved host of the, uh, Steam Pipe Alley from many years ago.  Why must my past haunt me? 
[01:19:30]  Why?  Didn't you do Bunghole Alley?  Wasn't that you on Stovetop Stuffing?  Why?  I live in the projects and they still attack me every day.  What happened to your kid, Joe?  Aren't you doing anything anymore?  How come I don't see you on TV anymore?  You're on Sex and the City.  You bet your ass I was.  Now get out of my way.  Yes, yes.  I, I, I was, I love how you, like, defend me.  Yes.  Even when I'm in character, berating myself, you come to my defense. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, I, I.  See, the difference between you and annoying laugh, Anthony, we, we like you.  Of course.  I know you do.  Oh, jeez, you gotta be pounding, Anthony.  You know what I.  He's outside the studio.  He hasn't laughed.  Sulking.  People.  There it is.  What?  I like you, too.  Oh, Anthony.  Just in a different way.  All right.  Oh.  He just needs to be loved.  Get your cars out.  Drive them around.  Um, so, you know, I, I don't know what to do with you. 
[01:20:30]  No, all right.  Sex and the City.  Sex and the City.  That's what I'm doing.  Yeah, I did, I was on the season premiere and I'm doing one more in a few more weeks.  Sweet sex in the city, you guys.  I'm so happy.  It's made me really famous.  What, what, what, what's your, what's your character about on that?  Uh, well, I play Anthony Marantino, who's, uh, who, actually, I did one episode last  year.  I was Kristen Davis's, who plays Charlotte's wedding consultant, or stylist, and then this  year, she tried to fix me up with, uh, the first episode was, they tried to fix me up 
[01:21:00]  with this guy that was.  You're playing, you're playing a gay guy on Sex and the City?  I'm playing a gay.  Is that a stretch?  I'm playing a gay.  I'm playing, I love this.  Um, you're playing a gay.  You're playing a gay.  You're playing a gay guy.  Yeah, I'm guy.  Did you see that?  I can say the word fag, because I'm a homosexual.  Fag.  Chitty, chitty, fag, fag.  Chitty, chitty, that was so funny last night.  Friggin' fag, you want to make out or something?  Was that great?  That was the best. 
[01:21:30]  They didn't blame you.  Gee, the little things weren't on you.  You friggin' fag, you want to make out or something?  So you're playing a gay guy.  I'm playing a gay.  I know that's just saying that.  Yeah, I'm playing a gay guy.  A gay.  Yeah, and the next...  Was it a stretch?  Yeah, it was a big stretch, I'll tell you that.  Bend over, we're gonna give you some range.  Um, yeah, I...  Why aren't you...  You should have gotten that on Queer as Folk on Showtime.  You want to know what?  That is the car crash television show of the same. 
[01:22:00]  Is it?  Is it?  Have you watched it?  Oh, I haven't missed an episode.  It's so ridiculous that you can't...  And then, like, I love how all the guys are, like, you know, everybody's, like, on talk  shows talking about their girlfriend.  Right, right.  Oh, suck my ass!  We do not want to hear you talking about your girlfriends when you're playing a gay on Showtime!  Yeah, I...  It was just a thing in the post today.  Believe it or not, these five hairdressers are hunky, hot, and heterosexual.  How do you know they're not getting their thing sucked someday by the shampooers? 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't know that.  You don't know the dark secrets that people carry.  They carry them, they carry them, until eventually they become a big boil on their head, and they  pop, and the pus drips all over them and kills them.  That's what happens when you repress.  Repression is bad.  I'm a guy!  You know, you pass by that show there, Queer as Folk, because I just passed by it, Mario.  I tell you, I just...  You're like, oh, look, it's Housebox Ass. 
[01:23:00]  She came back.  There's a lot of plowage on that show.  Every time I pass by it, yeah, there's just hardcore man-on-man sex going on on that show.  And a lot of people think I'm...  Some people know they know me from somewhere, but they'll go,  aren't you that guy on Talk Soup?  Oh, aren't you that guy on Queer as Folk?  No!  That's Housebox!  Thank you very much.  I'm not on Queer as Sheease.  I got sand in my... 
[01:23:30]  Wait, Jackie has a question.  This is pretty funny.  Jackie, what's up?  There's not a man or a woman on the air.  What?  Oh, shut up!  You shut up.  You're still on the street.  It's Judy Garland, Jackie.  It's Judy Garland.  Back from the dead.  And Liza is over here.  And Lorna and Joey and Sid Love stole my money.  I want my money, Sid.  I loved her drunken rambles.  Oh, it's...  I have the tape.  Do you have the tape?  It's devastating. 
[01:24:00]  Another car crash.  We're supposed to play it on the air.  Another car crash.  It's devastating.  I don't know if you want to play it on the air.  Really?  It's very...  Yeah, it's too much.  You still have a soft spot in your heart for her.  You don't want to make her come across like...  I love her.  But the stuff she was saying, a lot of it was true.  She's like,  David Bigelman and Freddie Fields, my agent,  stole my money  and Sid Love gambled it at the...  My eyes have seen the glory  of the coming of the Lord. 
[01:24:30]  I, I, Lorna, bring me those, those pills.  I need my vitamins.  What's the next song?  I'm what Mark Lindsay lays down.  Yeah, I've heard pieces of those tapes  and it's just brutal.  It's the first thing she says,  she's got this box,  she's got the recording,  she's like,  now let me see if I can work this black Nazi box.  I don't know, is this box, is it, hello? 
[01:25:00]  I'm going to shut it off now  and see if it's working.  Click.  And then you go back and say,  well, it was, it was, it was, it was work.  Oh my God.  They're all going to laugh at you.  It's like Carrie.  They're all going to laugh at you.  We're very sorry, Cassie.  It's Carrie.  You can trust me, Carrie.  You know me, Carrie.  You can trust me.  They're all going to laugh at you.  I see your dirty pillows. 
[01:25:30]  They're breasts, mama.  And your, your stepdad's on the line.  What is he doing?  We've been making them hold.  Hey, Sal.  Down.  Turn your radio down.  Turn the radio down, Ro.  Ro.  I got to tell you,  Steve, my ex-boss was listening to you guys  you were talking about last night.  Yeah.  I got to tell you,  I enjoyed myself so much.  You liked Erisman?  Even though my ears are still ringing,  I decided if you can get me Metallica tickets,  that's where I want to go.  You want to go see Tallica?  Nice.  Tallica, Ro says Metallica, yes. 
[01:26:00]  That's what I want to see.  Download it off of Napster.  What?  Yeah, see what?  Get some Metallica from Napster.  He went, he went last night, Mario.  I took him, Sal, my mother,  sister, and brother-in-law to see Erisman.  They were right up front  and Sal gets out of the show.  He's yelling because his ears are,  wait a minute,  his ears are ringing.  He's like,  Ro, where's the limo, Ro?  He's just yelling because his ears are shot.  He's like,  I didn't know Erisman.  But I thought we were seeing air supply. 
[01:26:30]  Which is a big difference.  That's a big difference.  So your ears are still ringing, Sal?  They haven't stopped,  but I want to go again.  Just give them a few days.  If we can get their Tallica tickets,  I'm ready to go.  He just said Tallica.  He left them up.  Like a real Metallica fan.  Go see Tallica.  Yeah, that's it.  All right, Sal,  we'll get you some tickets.  You want to go see Korn?  Oh, yeah.  Them too.  Anybody that's good rock.  Sal, get into the pit.  Start moshing.  You want to talk to your mom real fast?  Yeah, where's Mommy?  Hey, Mommy, you're on the air.  Come here.  Where's Rose? 
[01:27:00]  Rose!  And I definitely want to stand up again  for two, three hours.  That's great.  Hold on.  He thought it was like Westbury,  Kenny Rogers at Westbury  where everyone sits.  Sal had to stand.  How's Sal's ears, Mom?  What?  Oh, he can hear sort of.  It'll take him a few more days, I think.  Are you wearing your Aerosmith shirt  that you bought at the show last night?  Oh, yeah.  It's like a dress.  I love it.  I went to the gym in there, you know.  Dance, Mom rocks.  Had a few looks from a few of the women.  What the hell?  You had a good time, though?  I had a great time.  Good seats.  You got to see Steven Tyler. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, please.  It was phenomenal.  She was in a front row.  Yeah, she was going right up to the rail  and taking pictures of Steven Tyler.  I didn't care who was chasing me away.  And she had to keep saying,  you know, he's no kid anymore,  but he looks great.  Yeah, he does.  He does.  He looks good, though.  He does.  He looks great, though.  He does.  Mom, you remember Mario Cantone  from Steampipe Alley?  No.  Remember I used to watch Steampipe Alley?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And he would do all those wacky bits and stuff.  Oh, that's the person who's on now? 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  Right now, Mommy.  Oh, I thought it was a woman.  No.  Oh, Jesus.  I get that from the operators, too.  Ma'am, I'm sorry.  I don't have that number.  Oh, I didn't know that.  No, it's all right.  You know, I'm every woman.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  You say so.  Mommy!  Mommy, he does Mommy Dearest.  Yeah, but, you know.  Yeah, I do do Mommy Dearest.  Oh, God.  Christine!  Oh, Christine, I told you! 
[01:28:30]  What are these wire hangers doing in the closet?  Oh, no, Joan Crawford.  That's Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford.  Right.  The real Joan Crawford.  The real Joan Crawford, right.  The real Joan Crawford sounded like this.  I'd like my set at 58 degrees, otherwise I don't go on the set.  And when I leave, I turn to the crew and I say, bless you.  Oh, God.  That's the real Joan Crawford, but no one gets it, because no one knows what she really sounded like.  Right.  They all know from Mommy Dearest. 
[01:29:00]  I know, you know.  They all know from Mommy Dearest and Faye Dunaway.  Okay.  I love you, Mommy Dearest.  I love you, too.  I'll talk to you later.  Okay, bye.  Bye, Ro.  Bye.  How cute is Ro?  Her name is Rosalie?  Rosemary.  Well, it's Marie.  Mario.  Rose.  The coolest mom right there.  Yeah.  She's very cute.  She's like, and she goes, and she works out, she's 62 years old.  She works out every day to the point where, you know, she's in better shape than I could  ever dream of being in.  And she's, uh, she's like really fit.  She's strong, too. 
[01:29:30]  She's like smacking the back of the head at the table and going, ow.  She's Italian, huh?  Oh, yeah.  It's amazing because, you know, the Italian women in my mother's generation, they did not  work out.  No.  No.  Like, you know, they were staring at the sauce.  The big mamarelles.  The mamarelles.  The big fat ass.  The big boobs that, uh, during the holidays, they'd rest them on the table.  They would.  And their plate would have to be a good two feet away from them because it was pure boob.  They could knead the gnocchi with those breasts.  Um, but my sister, Marion, is, is in her fifties and she, uh, looks incredible. 
[01:30:00]  And she goes to the gym like five times a week.  She looks unbelievable.  Yeah, they're gym rats now.  They're unbelievable.  It's amazing.  Well, the gym's good.  You know, it's a good thing.  And she's dancing around at Aerosmith last night.  She's rocking.  Rock and rolling.  Jesus Christ.  She's my mother.  And we definitely have to take a break to catch up.  Yeah, we got to catch up.  Uh, Mario from Massachusetts.  So this, this bit will make him laugh pretty hard.  How do you say C-A-U-L-K in Massachusetts?  C-A-U-L-K!  C-A-U-L-K!  Exactly.  C-A-U-L-K!  Draw a Tommy cork!  Tommy, you have a big cork! 
[01:30:30]  Oh, get the cork out of the wine bottle!  Put, take your cork out of the wine bottle!  You're plugging up the wine bottle with your cork!  It's a cork!  It's your cork!  Get the cork screw!  That's right.  Don't dump out.  That's how they say it.  That's the juices.  That's cork!  That's cork.  It's cork.  C-A-U-L-K!  C-A-U-L-K!  It used to happen all the time.  When I was living up there, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  Anthony, could you please get the cork out of the bottle? 
[01:31:00]  Bobby!  Bobby!  Stop doing that crack in the back room!  Come out here and serve the customers!  That's my cousin, Go-Go!  Bobby!  I know you're smoking that crack in the back room!  She's going to run out of breath at the end of every sentence.  You're smoking crack in the back room!  You better get back out here and serve the customers!  I can't do it alone!  And I cannot stand that disgusting smell of crack!  I can't do it anymore!  I can't do it anymore!  Get it!  Where's your wife?  Lisa! 
[01:31:30]  Lisa!  I have...  I...  Let me tell you something.  I...  I held a shower for Lisa because she wanted a shower at the town line of Lynn, and I gave  her power!  Now, Connie had a shower for her daughter, and let me tell you something.  She wanted all the bridesmaids to pitch in.  I said, these girls have little jobs!  They can't pitch in!  She's got a lot of nerve to have them pitch in!  I said, Connie, these girls have little jobs! 
[01:32:00]  They can't pitch in!  I can't breathe anymore!  Get me my oxygen tank!  Wow!  Oh, my God!  Oh, screw the bit!  Little jobs!  We don't need to play it, then!  You want to play the call?  I just did it!  Yeah, right?  All right, play it?  Play it!  I'm going to throw it before...  Yeah, we did a play call, and we called it, what, I don't know...  I think it was one of those big home centers.  Oh, yes.  Just say that.  One of those big name home centers. 
[01:32:30]  Right, and this lady is from Massachusetts, and she was looking for C-A-U-L-K.  And she...  Caulk.  Right, what you used to plug your, you know, the windows up or your bathtub or something.  Caulk.  Caulk.  Right, right.  All right, let's play C-A-U-L-K here, and we'll be back with Mario Cantona.  Oh.  Hello, miss.  I'm an elderly woman.  I just moved here from Boston, Massachusetts, and I have a leaky bathtub.  Uh-huh.  I believe I need caulk to fill in the hole. 
[01:33:00]  Do you need pardon me?  I need caulk!  Okay, please hold.  Thank you for holding.  We will be with you shortly.  Oh.  Yes, I'm in desperate need of caulk.  The old caulk just ain't working anymore.  Okay.  Over in the paint department, they have GE silicone they got for that.  Is that good caulk?  Sure is.  And that works good in the bathtub?  Sure does.  Could I speak to someone in the paint department?  Sure.  Hold on one second.  You should call my caulk.  Hello, miss.  I need caulk. 
[01:33:30]  You need caulk?  No, I need caulk.  If I needed caulk, I would have said caulk.  Clark.  Does he supply the caulk?  Can you spell this for me?  C-A-U-L-K.  Cork.  Please hold.  Hello?  Paint department.  Hi, I need caulk.  Huh?  I need caulk.  Clark?  Cork.  Yeah?  I need caulk.  Because I own a house now, and all the caulk in my house is all dried up.  Okay. 
[01:34:00]  I need some brand new caulk.  You carry caulk?  You need caulk?  Yes, I need caulk for my bathtub.  Um, what kind?  Just, uh, what kind of color are you looking for?  I don't really care.  I like white caulk, but, uh, I'll take any color.  The caulk that's in my house is all dried and cracked.  Oh, is it?  And it's leaky caulk.  I need new caulk.  All right.  Well, we got all sorts of shapes and varieties here of caulk for you, you know.  All kinds of shapes of caulk? 
[01:34:30]  Oh, yeah.  We even have one that's about two feet long.  Really, darling?  A tube, yeah.  Well, that's a lot of caulk.  Yeah.  I probably could use that much.  Yeah, a lot of people could.  Thank you, sir.  You've been very kind.  Also, we have some, uh, some special guns to attach to the caulk, you know.  Get a little more width there.  Caulk?  Gun?  Yep.  Oh, that sounds very exciting.  I'll have to come down.  All right.  We got plenty for you.  Thank you very much.  And if you don't see anything on the shelf you like, some of our employees have their own  that they give to you.  Their own special brand of caulk? 
[01:35:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's wonderful, darling.  We do everything for you here.  Thank you very much, son.  We even send someone over to your house sometimes to help you use it.  To help me install the caulk?  Yep.  They'll install it for you real nice.  Somebody could help me put the caulk in, really.  That's right.  That's wonderful.  All right.  So you have a good day, man.  Thank you, son.  Bye.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW. 
[01:35:30]  Hey, what would carbon sound like, uh, smoking pot?  You guys, I am so relaxed right now.  Can I get a cookie, please, man?  Man, can I get a cookie?  I want a skew to play.  Man, can I get some pancake, don't you? 
[01:36:00]  Oh, sweet.  Everything looks so kind of fun.  Thank you, guys.  Cassie, you're eating prostitutes.  I'm so happy.  I feel like I'm floating.  Hey, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  877-692-1027.  Friggin' fag.  You want to make out or something? 
[01:36:30]  Mario can't tell it in the studio.  That was great.  That's one of his bits.  Carpenter getting high.  I didn't even remember what I did when I did that.  Yeah.  That's because I was just there, you guys.  I don't know.  It's so weird.  That's bizarre that went on like that.  Do you do Carmen on stage, though?  Once in a while.  A little bit?  Yeah, I do them in the vagina monologues.  My vagina kicks ass.  Yeah.  Yeah, I do them a little bit. 
[01:37:00]  You know, it's weird to do.  I mean, I love doing them, but it's weird because it's not my character.  It's Gray Parker, so you just feel like I resisted it for a long time.  You do it really well.  With the encouragement of opiate anthony, Mike Cartman has come out of the closet.  Get your balls out.  Slap your penis.  Pinch your scrotum.  Ouch!  It's today.  Can I just tell you that...  Oh, that's my favorite floor. 
[01:37:30]  Me and Grom by the other day going, get your balls out.  There's a thing like, straight, like, guy, like, with tattoos, get your balls out.  With his thumbs up, his thumbs up, like, and then three guys in front of, um, no, no boys  the other day, we want to be an anthony, we took a picture with us.  I'm like Norma Desmond.  I'm like this old husband who's going, where are the boys?  Where are the boys?  They all want me to take pictures.  It is Max, bring in the champagne and the caviar.  Hold on, Lois.  Oh, my God, it's Lois Black. 
[01:38:00]  It's Margot Channing.  Lois Black has entered the parquet.  No, please, get ready, boys.  Yeah, Dallas starts Monday.  Oh, yeah.  That'll be good.  There's a market for you.  Oh, what's the matter, Lois?  There's a market, huh?  You ever played Dallas?  Never.  Never.  Oh, yeah.  Dallas is going to love us, Lois.  I love you guys.  They will.  Yeah, let's talk about silicone and cowboy hats.  That's Dallas.  A lot of Republicans down there.  No, they're beyond Republican.  Really?  Yeah, they came out of sludge and now they move. 
[01:38:30]  Please.  Wow.  People are like, Mario, why don't you play the South?  Yeah, I want to play the South.  They killed Kennedy.  Hello?  Yeah, me, James.  Ball game's over.  Ball game is over.  They killed Kennedy.  That's the deal.  They, the whole city of Dallas.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  They're all a part of it.  Absolutely.  They're all a part of it.  I have nightmares of them.  I have nightmares of playing down in the South, like in Dallas, and just an image of me  with a microphone cord wrapped around me and hanging sweet.  Now, that's funny.  I'm telling you.  Now, that's funny. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, I'm going to the South.  Come on.  Let me do my stand-up and then you can lynch me.  Oh, God.  Yeah, not too sympathetic down there.  Well, it's, who knows?  I'm just afraid to do it.  You've done it, Louis?  I've done it.  I played, the worst was Biloxi, which is a real good move on my part.  Oh, yeah, boy.  Let's go to Mississippi.  Let's be, you know, why don't you just walk around on a, why don't you ride a mule through  the city where the thing on the back says, I'm a Jew, kill me.  I'm a Jew, kill me. 
[01:39:30]  Unbelievable.  Biloxi, Mississippi is the only place in my entire life where these people got, went berserk  on me in the audience.  They were like, you know, they were heckling to the 10th power.  Really?  I finally said, look, you know, I said, will somebody walk them?  I was in a place called Knuckleheads.  That'll give me that.  Knuckleheads.  And you said, we're going to walk together.  They said, I basically had to walk them.  And they left, and they, and they, apparently, once I got, once they were out, I was finishing  up, and everything went great once they were gone.  And the manager came in from the casino and said, I wouldn't go out there if I was you. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, wow.  So finally, when I went outside, they had waited outside for me.  I'd been in the, I'd been.  We're going to get that Jew, boy.  Well, it was, no, they said, they said, you know, you, you know what we're going to do  to you, you New Yorker, you.  And I thought, you know, they're not even bright enough to know that I'm a Jew.  You know what I mean?  It was like, damn, if only we knew he was a Jew, we could have called him a Jew.  Instead of just New Yorker, you know, because, hey, Jew sounds better. 
[01:40:30]  I don't know how you had the boss to go down there and do it.  I can, this is why I'm poor, and I live in New York, and I stay here.  I can't go anywhere else and do it.  I don't want to go anywhere else.  It's a part of my, it's part of my outreach program.  Oh, there you go.  I love it.  I mean, I love taunting them.  I mean, I go down and talk about evolution.  I say I'm not, I do, in Southern Baptist areas, I discuss, you know, the fact, I'm not  going to argue evolution anymore.  You people are idiots when it comes to this.  Oh, great. 
[01:41:00]  The fact that you let your neighbors run this area and they don't even believe, I  said, they don't believe in evolution?  Why are you talking to them?  Evolution is a small part of the thing I like to call reality.  Hello?  Fossils?  We win.  Shut up.  See, now he's knocking Christ the Lord.  First his people done killed him.  Now he's got a bad mouth.  I really feel, Jim, you know, I feel really honestly that Jesus loves everybody.  He really does.  And you know, when I was married to Jim Baker, you know, we had a good marriage.  It was difficult, but he wasn't a crook. 
[01:41:30]  But Jesus really loves you.  But I love gay people.  I really do.  You know Jim Bullock and everybody.  I like them too, you know.  And I even like all the Jews.  I really, really do.  I really do.  I think I got a hostess cupcake in my eye.  Anthony, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Listen, I just got to tell you, every time I hear this guy Mario's voice, I have to cringe.  He's a very funny guy and everything like this.  But when I was younger, I think it was Sunday morning, Steam Pipe Alley was on. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And my mother and father would be drinking their coffee or whatever.  And every time the friggin' show came on, every single week they would hop up, put me  and my brother in front of the TV, give us juice, cookies, candy, everything, and go  in the bedroom and have unbelievable, crazy long sex.  Well, see, I swear to God you were a babysitter for parents that wanted to have sex.  That's unbelievable.  That's a horrifying thing.  But you know what?  At least they were having sex with each other and not with, you know, whoever. 
[01:42:30]  It's a good thing that they were.  Obviously, they loved each other.  But it was like, it was like Steam Pipe Alley was on and now they can go have sex.  And now I'm all scarred and shit every time I hear.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I'm sorry, fellas.  Oh, you were big, gentlemen.  Your father was giving your mother the Steam Pipe Alley.  Yeah, really.  You say, holy shiatsu food massage, and you can get away with all the sand in your vagina you  wear.  They were like, don't leave the couch.  They're like, me and Daddy are going into the room to talk. 
[01:43:00]  Oh.  Here's your juice.  To powwow and pow pow.  Yo, guys, thanks a lot.  And let me just say, what's up?  Boogie night.  The real boogie night.  All right, Anthony.  Thank you.  A little code going out.  Hey, you guys want to see Bob Crane having sex?  No.  Oh, that's fantastic.  What is there?  Is there a video?  We have a website that we go to and see video clips of Bob Crane.  From Hogan?  Colonel Hogan.  Colonel Hogan.  Once again, digging some tunnels. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, he was supposedly, he was like Mr. Bang Bang, right?  He made his own pornos.  He made his own pornos.  His son, Scotty, is putting all these flicks on the website.  Yeah, that's right.  I didn't have children.  This is back in like the old days where you couldn't just pick up a palm quarter and tape yourself having sex.  He's running around like Ed Wood setting up these cameras with the big reels of film on it.  It's like it was a pain in the ass to film your own video about your own porno back then.  But we saw some earlier. 
[01:44:00]  Well, we learned Bob Crane has a peeler.  A peeler, yeah.  And he's a shower and a grower.  Yes.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  He was packing a lot down there.  And he's very delicate when it comes to the peach.  Yeah, the peach.  Yeah, he was...  Delicate when it comes to the peach?  He was...  Let's just say he was dining.  He was dining.  And his style, very delicate.  Was it a New Jersey white peach or a New Jersey yellow peach? 
[01:44:30]  Believe me, back then it was the girls.  They didn't do what they do now.  There's a lot of waxing going on and hygiene and all types of hedge trimming going on.  But back then, I swear, when he moved his face into a certain area...  You ever see the episode of Gilligan's Island where it was evil Gilligan with the big goatee?  That's what he looked like.  Hold on one second.  He looked like the evil Bob Crane.  All right, I'm good. 
[01:45:00]  All right, listen.  Where is it?  We've got to show these guys Bob Crane.  Bob Crane.  He's a shower and a grower.  A shower and a grower.  His penis is afloat at the Gay Pride this weekend.  Some people are just growers.  Some people might not be impressive just showing, but it's like, wow, what a surprise.  It's a grower.  Right.  And he's a peeler.  He's a peeler. 
[01:45:30]  He's a peeler.  I'm not getting...  A peeler, you know, like a cannoli.  Oh, hey.  Oh, hey.  I think I had too much cinnamon.  I didn't think about that.  You're quick.  Now I just need the...  I've got to go to the members area.  Oh, you're going there.  If you would enter the code in.  Okay.  We're going to have Scottie Crane on the show next week.  Bob Crane.  Is that right?  Yes.  Lewis, you've got to go over there.  What's he doing?  What is his son doing? 
[01:46:00]  I mean, talk about that.  He has a son that hates his father.  He's making money off his dad's porno collection.  But he keeps saying his dad would have loved this.  You know, his dad would have been thrilled.  All right.  Here's some of the videos we can choose from.  Lewis, come on over here.  Let me see you guys.  Let me see you guys.  Let me see you guys.  Let me see you guys.  Let me see you guys.  All right.  Let's get right to some action with this one.  No, no, no.  Don't give that out.  Yeah, we won't give that out yet.  Because it'll slow down.  Yeah, it completely slows down the viewing.  But his son thought it was great to just take these old films of his father having sex 
[01:46:30]  and release them to the public.  You mean he's actually releasing them?  Yeah.  Bob Crane, his son.  Here's one of the lovely ladies.  It looks like a son.  And here comes Bob Crane.  Here comes Colonel Hogan.  There he is giving her what he likes to call the Lebow.  Now he's giving her the Schultz.  And when he gets to the Colonel Clink, that's great.  That's when she needs a monocle in her eye because of what's coming at her.  Look at that.  A little bit of Bob Crane having some doggy, big doggy style. 
[01:47:00]  What do we know?  We know it's Bob Crane.  Don't make me go to the still pictures.  Because I'll do it.  I'll go to some still pictures.  Give him the one still, Ed.  The one still.  We know it's him.  Bob Crane.  All right.  It looks like Bob Crane in 19...  Visit our photo gallery.  You tell me this isn't Colonel Hogan.  Oh, my God.  It's Colonel Hogan.  Colonel Hogan getting a little oral satisfaction.  Oh, my God.  That's Colonel Hogan.  I cannot believe that. 
[01:47:30]  And then what happened was in Arizona in 1978, somebody didn't like what he was doing with  one of the girls he was doing something with, and actually beat his head in with his own  tripod from his camera, killing him.  That's how Bob Crane died.  Show him the peach thing.  Oh, oh, okay.  Yeah, this is me.  Look at Lewis.  It is one of the most...  You keep coming back, Lewis.  It is one of the most educational programs.  It is.  Yes.  All right.  Well, that's why I come in here, because I, you know, this is kind of...  I heard about this.  Which one is the peach-eating video? 
[01:48:00]  It looks like it was filmed during World War II.  It was back in the 50s, so you got to figure, you know, it wasn't like a camcorder.  No, I know, but...  This was very...  This was filmed.  Look, it's like a snuff...  Oh, wait.  There she is, taking care of Bob Crane.  She's got the black strip over her eyes, so you wouldn't know her now as she's like  80 years old.  Look at that.  Nice technique, though, on her.  She's really working Bob's crane.  I cannot believe this.  And let me see if I can find the one of him... 
[01:48:30]  The peach.  Dining on the peach.  Yeah, right now.  The peach.  I'm looking forward.  Is that this one?  No, I can't.  I can't remember.  I'll just go through it.  Wait.  Now, figure this out.  They can't...  We can't solve our energy problems, but I can get Bob Crane's pecker in a tenth of a  second.  Isn't that amazing?  Hello.  A dead man's pecker can come back, but we can't figure out what to do about energy.  Oh, here it is.  Here he goes.  Oh, good.  That's not a peach.  That's a peach cabinet.  Look at him go.  Look, he's snapping. 
[01:49:00]  That's a pool rack filled with afro hair.  There he goes.  Isn't that something?  It's Bob Crane, for God's sake.  Look.  Look, Mario.  Look.  Look, Mario.  Don't make me.  I'm looking.  Look, damn it.  Judas Priest.  Mario, that's disgusting.  Hey, cigars.  Mario, that's hot, right?  There he goes.  There he goes.  It's hot.  He's back in it.  It's hot.  I want to see this.  Oh, go.  Go back.  Rewind.  Rewind. 
[01:49:30]  Rewind.  Rewind.  Let me see it again.  Let me see it again.  Oh, look at her.  She's so hot.  Let me see it.  Oh, I'd like to do her.  I want to do her.  You know what's really strange?  I want to plow her.  I want to plow her seal.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, look at Close Up.  Close Up.  Look at that.  Look at his stump.  Look at that.  Oh, yeah.  You know what's strange?  He was supposed to actually be locked up in the POW camp here.  But in order to get to this girl's peach, he snuck out through that tree stump and climbed  out.  And Colonel Clink never knew.  He was out gobbling a little bush. 
[01:50:00]  He was back for roll call in the morning.  I'm smelling something funny.  Is that in, like, smell-o-vision?  Clink, you are a fool.  Do you know what Hogan is doing when he is supposed to be in the barret?  No, General Bogonda.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  There you go.  And we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:50:30]  1027 WNEW.  Hey, Mario.  Yes?  You can handle some Van Halen, right?  I love Van Halen.  Rock on.  Rock on.  Rock on.  MF-Rs.  Hey, it's no Judy Garland, but, you know.  Can I say one thing that I absolutely hated this year?  Can anybody see Moulin Rouge?  Yeah.  It sucked my dirty...  I hated it so much!  I hate her.  I hate her.  And let me tell you... 
[01:51:00]  Let me tell you...  Who's in Moulin Rouge?  Nicole Kidman.  Oh, okay.  And let me tell you something about Moulin Rouge.  Can I just tell people that we're back with the Opie and Anthony show?  Sure.  Go ahead.  And I'm...  877-692-1027.  We just got to get that out there.  Now go.  Continue.  Everybody I know that saw that movie loved it.  Moulin Rouge.  And I'm going to tell you, it's so ridiculous.  And the music has nothing to do with the period of time that it takes place in.  It's flashy for being...  Just for being flashy.  She is the coldest actress in the country. 
[01:51:30]  And you know who's made that movie like a number one movie?  The same morons that like Madonna.  The same prideful morons that like Madonna.  That's who's made that movie number one.  And it's a piece of shiatsu foot massages.  It really is.  I hated it so much.  I wanted to rip.  I wanted to kill.  I think the video, the music video of the... 
[01:52:00]  I think that helped out.  Yeah, it helped out.  Let me tell you something.  When Patty the Bell sang that.  And I am so sick of hearing these singers with their riffy voices.  Can you sing a straight note for once?  For once?  I was in the subway today and I hear this girl.  Thanks to Mariah Carey and Christine Agrable.  I mean, that's all you hear is...  And then a hero comes along in the street to get out. 
[01:52:30]  Can I, could you lift it?  Lift it and straighten it out!  That's all they do is rip.  They think that's singing.  And it can't put it out.  And Cisco, with his dragon, that other one, don't get me started.  Cisco, how many S's in this?  Cisco, yeah, go ahead.  You like the ladies.  And this is for all the ladies. 
[01:53:00]  This is for all the ladies in the house.  If I hear that one more time, what about the fags that they want to hear it, okay?  This is for all the ladies in the house.  Well, shut up!  It's for everybody!  Friggin' fag, you want to make out or something?  That's the best part of the night.  That's the best sound.  That's so funny.  All right, I had to get that out.  Hey, Lewis, are you going to go see Moulin Rouge?  I saw it.  And he said everything, yeah.  Did you like it? 
[01:53:30]  No, no.  Well, she is Hillary Clinton.  That's who she is.  She's Hillary Clinton.  Yeah.  She's Hillary Clinton.  She's a stone cold.  And to me, she's like a fox.  But you see her on the screen and you go, I wouldn't want to get in the air.  No.  I don't get it.  I mean, I mean, I mean.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  I don't get it.  No wonder Tom dumped up.  There was eight minutes.  There was eight minutes that I liked because it was really fast.  There was eight minutes of it, the movie that I liked.  And it was really fast.  And they were going, it was really, really fast.  And since I don't do drugs anymore, it was almost like a strobe effect. 
[01:54:00]  And then it stopped.  And that was when the movie ended for me.  And halfway through it, I went, why didn't I get stoned before this?  And then I thought, it wouldn't have made a difference.  Okay.  Okay.  Can I tell you what I did go see that I liked?  Yeah.  I have to say, I like it.  Even though it's a big Disney bomb, I loved Atlantis.  That was pretty great.  Atlantis?  I thought you were going to say Pearl Harbor.  But no, I hate that movie.  I won't, actually, I have not seen Pearl Harbor, but I am not going to sit through three hours  and 16 minutes of a love story that I don't care about. 
[01:54:30]  And I have to wait two and a half hours for like the aerial view of the bomb.  For the bomb.  I don't care.  I don't care.  No.  I liked Atlantis.  Atlantis?  Atlantis, yeah.  Go to the Ziegfeld.  It's there.  Last night.  It's tonight.  Smoke a big boat.  And go watch it.  Sweet.  Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.  Very funny.  I love the Philly cheesesteaks.  Look at you trying to fit in.  I do.  I love Philly cheesesteaks.  You know, Boston had good food.  Boston had really nice cheese steaks, but we didn't call them Philly cheesesteaks  because they were made in Boston.  So we called them cheese steaks. 
[01:55:00]  And Louis Black in the studio from The Daily Show.  There's a lot of girls.  You know, Revere?  Revere.  No, they say Vavia.  They use a V instead of an R.  Vavia.  I was in a restaurant one time.  This girl was like, do you got any bread back there?  Bread.  Not bread.  Bread.  Who's got any bread?  Where are you from?  Vavia.  Vavia.  Revere?  Yeah, Revere.  Revere.  I need some bud sticks.  I love bud.  I want to dunk my bud in gravy.  It's really great.  Like that V instead. 
[01:55:30]  It's very strange.  Yeah.  That's odd.  Well, Admiral Magassi has a little of that.  Yeah.  He's like, don't go away.  We'll be right back with some crawfish.  We're going to kick it up with crawfish, onion vex, and some soda.  Bread.  He has a sitcom.  No, he's got a sitcom.  He has a sitcom.  No, he's got a sitcom.  And I am a desperate human being.  I can't believe he has a sitcom.  No, I do.  Why not?  Why not believe it?  Huh?  How many times do we have to go in front of those jackasses?  Parade our little wares. 
[01:56:00]  And they're like, oh, yeah.  How long have you been doing this?  180 years.  Oh, Emerald Lagasse.  He's got a pot in front of him.  Woo-hoo.  Let's get him.  Look what he does.  He makes stews.  Let's put him on the air.  God, he'll be so funny.  What's that thing he says?  Pow, bang, whatever that is.  What's that dummy thing he does?  Why are you so bitter?  Bitter?  Why are you so bitter?  You were a porn director on Law and Order.  Well, yeah, that was my...  And that was on last night.  Law and Order.  Law and Order.  It was a major breakthrough. 
[01:56:30]  It was on last night.  Yeah.  Did you have to really think about the role, or did you just imagine you were back on the  voyeur bus?  I just, no, I had to, I actually said, could we just do a thing where, don't we have, can  we have a scene where I, like, audition girls?  Yeah.  I was actually not the director.  I was the producer, wasn't I?  I was the porn producer.  Producer, right.  This was the best part of that, Ivan.  Paul Sorvino's in that.  You know, you know Paul Sorvino.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, so Sorvino's there.  And so I woke up to him, and George Zunza, who disappeared after he did this show, wasn't 
[01:57:00]  on.  And so, but Sorvino, it's his first day on it.  And I'm like, Mr. Schlepp, I've never done any of this stuff before.  I woke up to Sorvino, I go, you're doing this?  I thought, I did this because I thought George Zunza was going to do it.  I went, oh, son of a God.  And I walked away.  And he was like, God, I'm sorry about it.  And he started yelling.  He went up to people, and they said, well, no, Mr. Black's a comedian.  So then, for the next five days, I had to listen to every joke he's ever told. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, don't tell him.  Oh, man.  Don't tell anybody what you are.  You're doing dramatic work.  Shut up.  Because you will get material from every corner of the studio.  Did you hear this one?  He told you a million jokes, right?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, you know.  Jesus tap dancing Christ.  Well, you know, we're not supposed to be mad that Emerald Lagasse has a sick...  I mean, what planet am I living on?  Oh, and then that girl who does Survivor gets a thing? 
[01:58:00]  Oh.  She's in a movie, yeah.  She's in the animal.  That idiotic pig who won Survivor the first time...  He's got a radio show.  He's got a radio show!  He was supposed to be...  They were going to syndicate him on the...  What's that?  The Weasel Link.  That would be Richard Haas.  You are the weakest link.  I love her.  I love how it gets shorter and shorter.  By the end, she's like, you are the weakest link.  I love her.  She's home.  She's with her maid.  You haven't cleaned the sink.  Give her.  So, you played a porn director or a producer? 
[01:58:30]  A porn producer.  You know who...  You're like, honey, lift it up.  Lift up the press a little bit.  You should have done some research with watching Hardcore.  Yeah, no.  You ever see that movie Hardcore?  I saw Hardcore.  Did you put a bad hairpiece on or anything?  Remember when the guy came in?  I had a lot of...  You should see my hair then.  Yeah.  It was scary then.  Remember when the one guy came in to audition in Hardcore and the guy says,  ah, what's your name?  Who was the star of that?  What's his name?  George C. Scott.  George C. Scott.  He goes, what's your name?  I'm Big Dick Black.  Remember that?  And he goes, you're not our type. 
[01:59:00]  You don't want to hire any niggas, that's all.  Right?  Remember that?  That's from the movie.  From the movie.  And then my favorite, actually, if you ever see it.  I got it right here.  You got it?  When he's watching...  Because the whole plot of the movie is this guy's daughter runs off,  goes to a big city, and gets into pornography.  Hardcore porno.  He's searching for her all over.  Finally, this investigator that he gets says,  all right, I'm going to sit in this theater.  I'm going to show you a film.  It's going to be rough.  But you sit and watch.  He then sits and watches a movie of his little girl, 
[01:59:30]  his innocent little daughter,  with two guys just being hammered front and back.  Horrid.  So here's George C. Scott as the father,  sitting in the theater, watching his daughter.

[02:02:00]  habits because of stinky he's trolling at night in his give me the scene in his tidy white in his  tidy white that's it just sitting on a hardwood chair in front of the computer wakes up dark light  in the kitchen you know and he just gets on the computer and chats it up and goes on different  sites you know this is why you need you need places like a boarding house in new york so you 
[02:02:30]  don't have to be live with that but lewis he has a really good view from the roof of his building  and they share they share a room i think we have some audio of a room yes they share a room  this is wrong this is wrong you're on radio you can ask you go hello i need help can you get me  out of here i'd like you know you got people who come in here to have darts thrown in their back  you can't find a room it's one room and they have like little lofts on either side of the room and  stinky's bed's on one side his bed's on the other we do have audio of uh right before they went to 
[02:03:00]  sleep the other night uh his roomie do you like having your background wow  dicky we need to set up a fund for you no we don't like an apartment we don't want to help  him because it makes good radio this is radio gold it is it's unbelievable so a bunch of us went over  to his uh apartment last night to check it out yeah there's what about eight of us like excuse me

By improving that not only do drinking and driving don't mix, but now drinking and reading  don't mix.  Yeah, you could blow out an eye.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  We got the latest interview from Mike Tyson. 
[02:39:30]  That's right.  It's in Max and Magazine.  Should be on newsstands in a couple days here.  This guy hung out with Mike for 36 hours in Las Vegas.  This guy hung out with the planet's most violent celebrity.  And there's just some funny things in this interview.  First of all, the interviewee was scared S-less.  He didn't know how to go about asking Tyson the really tough questions.  Because he was face-to-face with them.  Isn't that funny?  Whenever we do interviews, people don't care what the hell they ask us about, whether it 
[02:40:00]  might piss us off or something or make us defensive.  I wonder what the difference is.  Right.  They look at us and go, my sister could beat you guys off.  It starts off pretty funny, because there you have Tyson and the guy that's going to interview  Tyson.  And it says, sitting in a corner booth at H&H Barbecue, a greasy soul food joint in  a mall off the Las Vegas Strip, Mike Tyson is snapping chicken bones with his thick, restless  fingers, splintering the marrow into soft, tongue-moistened shards so it resembles Linguini. 
[02:40:30]  He has the eyes of an executioner.  They've locked in on my own, and they're spinning in their sockets like twisters.  That's a lunatic!  Holy mackerel.  Tyson's talking about prison, the years he's done for rape and assault, and I'm jabbing  him with little questions, working nervously and methodically toward the bigger questions  I want to ask him.  And someone asked the interview guy, what's it like asking Mike Tyson about sexual predators 
[02:41:00]  in prison?  Tyson, and the interviewer goes, complete terror.  I beat around the bush until he catches on.  The fighter shakes his head and growls.  You want to do this with Tyson?  Yeah, what did he say?  Listen, everyone's pathetic in there.  If you think you're tough, you're going to get effed up.  They're going to eff you.  They're going to cut you.  No one is what they appear to be.  You meet a guy, and he's nice and funny. 
[02:41:30]  Then you find out he killed a bunch of kids.  Put him in a microwave.  You want to put people in the microwave?  I like it.  You know, like movie popcorn.  You put him in the microwave.  Well, I have trouble with my microwave at home because of my gold two-faces.  I have to hit the button and run away because the radiation of the microwave makes my teeth spark.  My gold teeth, they start sparking and arcing because that's what microwaves do to metal objects. 
[02:42:00]  How do Mike know that?  I don't know, but I know it.  I know when my teeth start sparkling, like the 4th of July sparklers, I've got to get away from the microwave.  We can't trick you, right, Mike?  You can't trick me.  You know everything.  That's right.  Popcorn.  P-A-P.  No, no, it's P-O-K.  Corn.  K.  C.  C what? 
[02:42:30]  Never mind.  I'll see me punch you in the face if you say Mike can't spell.  All right, so more on the interview.  Then he starts talking about his amazing house.  He lives in a 10-bedroom mansion with a gym, a guest house, and a wine cellar.  I need that because I don't want the woman I'm assaulting in one room to hear the other one that I have just assaulted.  Because then they get a chance to run away.  And then Mike starts talking about his house, Mr. Tyson, if you will, from your interview.  I'm reshaping my house. 
[02:43:00]  I've been working hard on turning it into a nice home.  I like to do that stuff.  I read magazines like Architectural Digest and Decorating Digest.  I want to be an architect.  I like Architectural Digest.  It's a good publication.  And then I eat the cover.  And I eat the pages.  And the glue in Architectural Digest tastes much better than the glue in Decorating Digest. 
[02:43:30]  I want to be an interior decorator, but I ain't a faggot.  All right.  So then...  I am Elmer J. Fudd, millionaire.  I own a mansion and a yacht.  Then the guy interviewing Tyson, you know, finds out about his Bengal Tigers.  He has four of them.  And it says in this article, we hope to see the fighters four Bengal Tigers, but they're  in Dallas with a trainer until Tyson finishes his renovations on his brand new house.  If they were here, you'd be so effing scared.  I think the guy was effing scared just being with Mike Tyson. 
[02:44:00]  He's got tigers.  Yeah.  And he says leaning against the wall in his kitchen next to a row of air freshener cans.  When they stand up there like eight feet tall with heads as big as coffee tables, they like  to jump on you and break you down.  You'd get your ass kicked.  I introduced one to the newspaper guy one time and he had a heart attack.  It wasn't a good interview.  Hey, newspaper guy.  And then the guy goes, what does Tyson do with his tigers? 
[02:44:30]  I punch him in the balls and in their face.  It's like punching a cement wall.  They like it.  I'm like Siegfried and Roy with our severe mental problems.  That's right.  You never see Siegfried and Roy, those two pussies, punching their tigers in the balls.  They might punch each other in the balls, but they like that.  I hope they're letting that get through.  It's like punching a cement wall. 
[02:45:00]  He punches his tigers in the testicles.  What are they going to do?  Eat me?  I'll bite that bitch.  I don't care.  Don, what's going on?  Yeah, man, I want to ask Mike, whatever happened to his megaphone?  Didn't we always...  Wasn't Mike Tyson, for some reason, always on the megaphone?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's because he used the megaphone in England that one time.  Oh, that's...  Do you know something?  I couldn't remember why Mike Tyson was always through a megaphone for no apparent reason.  He went to England, and people were taunting him, so he grabbed the megaphone and started 
[02:45:30]  taunting him back through his hotel window.  I totally forgot about that.  And ever since, we did our...  My aunt did his Mike Tyson through the megaphone.  Shut up, you limey sons of bitches.  Look at your teethuses.  They look worse than mine.  You don't have good dental hygiene, like Mike Tyson.  Look at my teeth.  P-E-E-F-P.  Hi, Gene. 
[02:46:00]  H-I-G-E-N.  Hi, Gene.  Now I punch you, and I punch my tiger in the testicles.  He punches them in.  Who the hell would want to fight this guy?  The only reason I punch tigers in the balls is because there ain't no Tyrannosaurus left on the earth.  They were extinct millions of years ago.  I believe it was due to the climate change.  How do Mike know this?  I don't know, but I know. 
[02:46:30]  I would love to fight a velociraptor.  I would punch him in the balls.  Nothing he could do about it.  All right, so it goes on.  And now Tyson talks about his Prozac.  Tyson is on Prozac.  Apparently, a lot of it, previously, the heavyweight had been taking the antidepressant Zoloft to control his mania, winning off of it before his fights.  And then the famous quote, Anthony, I got right here.  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right? 
[02:47:00]  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all.  See, because I would just kill y'all.  Actually, I wouldn't kill him right away.  First, I'd just walk down the street punching people in the testicles, seeing his face as tough as my tiger.  You should see how they have to give me the Prozac and the Zoloft.  Here's somebody getting me some Prozac.  Oh, that one was in the butt.  Now I run around for a while.  And they got to chase me.  And then sometimes they found me next to a bush out in my backyard. 
[02:47:30]  And they put me in a cage and relocate Mike.  But Mike always finds his way home.  Sometimes I wake up and I got a radio collar on me.  And I scrape it off next to a tree.  And it falls off.  And they can't find Mike.  To give him more of his Zoloft.  Uh-oh.  Oh, that one.  Oh, I'm feeling a little woozy now.  Look at me.  I'm gorgeous.  Watch out.  I'm going into a death row. 
[02:48:00]  Death?  Death?  That's what I said.  Death.  I'll punch you to death.  Just watch.  First in the sack, just like my tigers.  Read this, Mr. Tyson, about the Zoloft and the Prozac.  I'm on it.  To keep me from killing you all.  Right.  I don't want to be on it, but my doctors are concerned the fact that I'm a violent person.  Almost an animal.  Almost.  That's what it says in the magazine.  Did I say that? 
[02:48:30]  Almost an animal.  I have three less hairs.  I'm like Rob Schneider in The Animal.  Sometimes I'm such an animal, I punch myself in the testicles.  Just to see how pissed I could get me.  And then I kick my own ass.  I'm taking bites out of my legs.  I'm crazy.  And then they start talking about how he wants to be a nice guy now.  I always want to be a nice guy, but I get in fits of rage when they put the little biplanes 
[02:49:00]  around me and try to shoot me off a tall building.  No, that's not in the article, Mike.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I'm trying to be a nice guy.  Right.  I'm trying to get my life back on track.  I'm on the verge of getting your life back to normal?  Yeah.  Okay.  And then the interviewer guy goes, what do you mean, Mike?  Listen, I'm crazy.  Whoa.  I'm effing crazy.  But there's got to be some dignity about me.  I'm older now and don't want my kids to think I'm a total maniac. 
[02:49:30]  I may be, but my children have a problem with the teacher.  I don't want them to, Mike turns the page, to be scared to come to me because I go down  and kick the crap out of the teacher.  In the past, I would have.  Holy ass.  The kids have a problem at school.  He goes down to the school.  Could you imagine that?  You're Mike Tyson's kid.  You have a problem with mathematics or something?  Why you give my son a D?  Well, he's not doing his work. 
[02:50:00]  Okay, I'm going to punch you in the testicles and I'm going to bite your ear off.  In the past, I would have.  But Mike Tyson, it says, is full of love.  I love everybody.  Black, white, gay, Jew, candy striped.  I don't want to hurt no one's feelings.  I'm on the Zoloft to keep from hurting no one's feelings and from pulling organs out of  your nose because I would do that.  Mike, what do you have to say about your bald head?  Oh, wait.  There are more Prozac for Mike.  Oh, I'm feeling good now. 
[02:50:30]  It takes the edge off.  He talks about ladies and how ladies love his bald head.  Why do they love your bald head, Mike?  Girls love bald guys.  They like to rub your little head when you go south on them.  Yeah, I think you can say that.  Because the bald head on top looks like the other one.  Only without the gold doofuses.  It's insane. 
[02:51:00]  What is this whole thing about being gay?  I know I ain't gay.  Are you gay, he asked me?  Nope.  Then it must be you, Mike.  Wait, who is he talking to?  Who the hell am I talking to?  Wait, back up.  What the hell was he talking about here?  They say one of three guys is gay.  Mac jokes.  His hand resting on Tyson's shoulder.  I know I ain't gay.  Are you gay?  He asked me.  Nope. 
[02:51:30]  Then it must be you, Mike.  Oh, I guess it's one of Mike's friends, Mac.  Why don't you shut up?  I'll punch you.  All right.  And then they go back to talking about prison, Anthony.  When you go to prison, your life is ruined.  Tough or not, you learn how to play the game.  Right now, right this second, people are getting effed.  People are getting sucked.  People are getting beaten and raped.  You've got to be one of those crazy mother effers to survive.  You've got to join the psychopaths club. 
[02:52:00]  I've joined that one.  I'm a card-carrying member.  That's funny how I say right now this second, people are getting effed, and people are getting sucked, and getting beaten and raped.  Because that's all just me.  That's all Mike Tyson.  Member of the psychopaths club.  P-S-Y-C-H-O-P-A-T-H-S.  Psychopaths.  Psychopaths.  Whoever let us put our thing in and all the man's behind.  Behind, behind, behind.  Watch him scream.  I'm so mean, I'm Mike Tyson. 
[02:52:30]  All right.  And then finally, Mr. Tyson.  You don't know when I'm effing you.  Let me tell you something.  There might be some prisoners years and years and years after they got out the joint.  If the memory fades, they might forget that they were raped in prison.  When Mike rapes you, on your deathbed, you're going, damn, that hurt.  And I remember it very vividly.  V-O-5-8.  V...  I'll come back to that one. 
[02:53:00]  All right.  And finally, he was watching the Discovery Channel over here.  I love the Discovery Channel.  Yeah.  The other day I saw a show on court TV.  There was this kid who got convicted of murder, a skinny, a Caucasian guy.  He got 20 years and he thought it was going to be a good deal.  He had no idea his life is over.  They're going to ask him, I said to myself.  They're watching this right now, and their mouths are watering.  He's like a London broil. 
[02:53:30]  I swear to God, he's like a prime rib.  I love when a newbie would come in the joint.  Go, Mike, I want to meet you.  I say, okay, bend over, fresh meat.  I would administer some Zoloft with my probe.  Sully, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  I just wanted to ask Anthony if he ever gets scared, like he'll see Tyson, you know, around.  I'm just, I wouldn't be afraid of Anthony.  That's why, you know, I wouldn't beat him up.  I'm afraid of that man. 
[02:54:00]  I just want to clear something up.  Anthony does the great impression of Mike Tyson.  Yeah, Anthony is amazing.  Hope he don't.  Yes, he does.  I'm Hopey.  No, no.  Hopey, Hopey, Hopey, Hopey.  No, no.  I will punch Hopey when I see him.  No, no.  Anthony does an incredible Mike Tyson impression.  That's pretty much it.  Just some of the highlights of the article.  I like what he says about Alexander the Great.  This is him on history.  Alexander got all the bitches, and they weren't all whores. 
[02:54:30]  Wasn't that Alexander great?  I should teach history.  Now, George Washington, he liked a good BJ just like the next guy.  But he got the skanky horse.  You ever see that Martha Washington?  She was a pig.  JFK.  Now, there's a man who could F.  And he was always good to his family, because he let his brother Bobby F the same chicks.  Till his head rolled off.  I swear to God, I could punch someone and make the back of their head fly off, just like JFK. 
[02:55:00]  Back and to the left.  Back and to the left.  Why don't I use the T?  That's a good letter.  I should use it.  Larry, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey, Larry.  For Anthony's sake, I hope Mike Tyson don't like this show.  Because he better learn how to run like Jesse Owens from him.  Yeah, Anthony does a great impression of Mike Tyson.  Shut up, Moppy.  It's an unbelievable.  Good luck, guys.  All right, bye.  Did you see the part of the interview when I talk about Robin Givens, my wife? 
[02:55:30]  No.  Back in 1989, she really offended me.  And he punched her.  I beat my former wife, Robin Givens, back in 1989.  I went bam, and she flew backwards, hitting every effing wall in the apartment.  That was the best punch I ever thrown in my effing life.  He says that?  He really says that?  That's a quote in the magazine.  Oh, man.  Yes. 
[02:56:00]  Man.  That aunt could take a punch.  Let me tell you.  Robin.  Come here, Robin.  What happened?  Why did you cook my steak?  You know I like it raw.  Showed up.  A couple of body blows.  Look at her going around.  She looked like a ball in a pinball machine.  Look at that.  Take that one.  Okay.  Don't try spraying me with pepper spray. 
[02:56:30]  I am impervious to pepper spray.  E-M-P-E-M-P-E-M-P-E-U.  Shut up.  Let me spell.  All right.  Go.  Impervious.  Yeah.  Q-R-M.  What the hell does that even mean?  Frank, what's going on?  I hit it so hard, I saw a tilt light over the bed.  Yo, what's up?  Game over. 
[02:57:00]  Insert another quarter and start punching the bitch again.  Frank no it's Mike all right what's up Mike yeah um I was watching Damon Wayans on TV he  was talking about how he made fun of Tyson yeah and uh Tyson grabbed him in a supermarket he  grabbed him and he bit him on the back of the neck and he's like he was he was talking about  he's like I'm biting him he's like he's like uh well you're Mr. Funny Man huh how funny are you 
[02:57:30]  now man he's like biting him he's like he said he said he fell back in his shoulder like he was his  little bee you know he's like he's like he didn't know what to do well I guess we gotta assume that  Mike Tyson has a sense of humor and that he really enjoys Anthony's impression of Mike Tyson actually  I can't do nothing about it even if I want to I got this thing uh and they put this wire in the  ground around my house and I wear a collar and if I step over the wire it gives me a joke it keeps
