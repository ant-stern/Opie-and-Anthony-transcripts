<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie and Jim Norton's typical crude banter, mocking their staff, Ben and Steve.  The bulk of the show focused on the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  The hosts expressed intense anger and outrage at the government's inadequate response, detailing the horrific conditions in the Superdome and Astrodome, including the lack of food, water, security, widespread looting, rape, and murder.  They criticized the slow deployment of aid, the apparent indifference of the Bush administration, and the reported desertion of a significant portion of the New Orleans police force.  Graphic descriptions and news coverage, including a seemingly staged "reveal" of a dead body on a Shepard Smith report, were discussed with profanity and cynicism.  The hosts fielded numerous listener calls, some expressing shared outrage, others criticizing the show's focus.  A phone interview with a Superdome emergency room doctor vividly detailed the horrific conditions and violence within the facility.  The show also referenced a previous successful comedic bit, a one-man Star Wars show. A recurring comedic element involved a large studio panel repeatedly falling near a host's feet.

The Katrina coverage continued, with predictions of a massive death toll and descriptions of widespread suffering.  More listener calls followed, some expressing frustration with the show's focus on the disaster.  The hosts defended their coverage as a major news story impacting listeners.  A "Hi Mom, I'm Gay" comedic phone call segment was included, along with a promotion for a Katrina relief charity auction featuring bizarre items like a broken pinball machine part and a host's worn jeans.  Comedian Bill Burr called in, discussing his recent stand-up performance and audience reactions from New Orleans.  Other callers contributed various perspectives on the unfolding crisis.

The show transitioned to reading humorous comic strips (Marmaduke and Beetle Bailey), followed by discussion of Bill Burr's upcoming stand-up performances.  Jim Norton revealed he had a urinary tract infection and detailed his foot injury and MRI results.  A news segment updated the Katrina aftermath and international reactions, including criticism of the US government's response.  Listener calls covered a DJ fired for allegedly encouraging suicide and reactions to Norton's speaking style.  A "Bombs and Flubs" segment analyzed failed jokes, with audio clips and discussion.  Further listener calls, Katrina updates, and a segment on listeners' "assaults on the media" followed.  The show promoted GameFly, a planned "Sex Offender" game, and upcoming guests Kelly Hansen (Foreigner) and Jeff Norris.  The hosts engaged in vulgar and sexually explicit humor throughout, with a running joke about Norton's perceived homosexuality. Bill Burr was a studio guest during this portion.

The show then shifted to a discussion of coffee preferences and healthy eating, taking a bizarre and crude turn with jokes about farmworker hygiene and field urination and defecation, visibly disturbing Norton.  A malfunctioning online Hurricane Relief Fund auction was discussed, along with a brief participation from a caller identified as Ralph (described as Mexican), and Danielle from Long Island, who described her neighborhood and her job as a veterinary technician.  Their calls led to further racially-charged jokes.  The "Sex Offender Game" followed, utilizing mapsexoffenders.com, with the hosts and Bill Burr guessing details of sex offenses from provided profiles.  A complex, confusing point system was developed mid-game.  Further discussion of the auction's difficulties and interruptions with vulgar comments and jokes occurred.

Kelly Hanson, Foreigner's new lead singer, called in. The interview was repeatedly interrupted by a listener, "Steve," using variations of an obnoxious, offensive persona, including homophobic and sexually explicit remarks and false claims about Lou Gramm.  Another listener, "Ben from Boston," contributed to the chaos with unsubstantiated claims about Lou Gramm and Tom Brady.  The hosts interacted with the callers' behavior, attempting at times to return to the conversation with Hanson.  A snippet of Hanson's singing was played.  The conversation touched upon replacing a lead singer, using Queen as an example.  Bill Burr's recent appearance was mentioned. The segment ended with banter about money and the broadcast's absurdity.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelch and I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable ass.  These dummies that work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby.  Always laughing in the wrong places. 
[00:04:00]  Ben, where's the quality?  He rocked.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, sing it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I'm scared of you.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Shut up. 
[00:04:30]  Own it, buddy.  You rock.  You better get your head and your ass wired together  or I will take a giant shit on you.  Son, all I've ever asked of my Marines  is for them to obey my orders  if they would the word of God.  Go ahead.  Go on.  Leave.  Leave.  I hate this place.  Okay.  Ha ha ha ha. 
[00:05:00]  Beyond AM.  Beyond FM.  It's XM Satellite Radio.  I'm trying to use the phone.  Do you want to kiss me?  Do you want to kiss me?  Do you want to kiss me?  Oh, no.  Not really.  It works if you turn the mics on. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, my God.  You hit those buttons.  Holy crap.  They turn red and it means we're on the air.  How long have I been doing this?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Spreading the virus across America.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Right.  Got to go right to the phones.  They're going absolutely nuts.  Ken from Wackbag.  What's up, Ken?  It's Captain Clark, actually, from Wackbag,  but that's cool.  All right.  Dude, Ray Negan,  they just played a little bit of his interview on CNN. 
[00:06:00]  He had probably about 15 minutes more of that  where he's just freaking out all the federal officials  for not doing shit.  He's saying he's been trying to declare martial law for two days.  Nobody's doing nothing.  It's reflected in the media coverage  because nobody on TV has really been reporting  the kind of shit that's been hitting the fan down there  since yesterday.  I know, Anthony, you're probably all up on it.  You've been watching it.  Anderson Cooper and Shepard Smith  both kind of freaked out yesterday on the air.  It was awesome.  Yeah, so did, what's his name?  Goddamn, who's the guy on CNN? 
[00:06:30]  Cafferty, Jack Cafferty.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Jack Cafferty lost his mind yesterday on CNN  just yelling at Bush and the administration  and the fact that nothing,  not nothing, but not enough is being done.  He actually brought up the fact that  it has a lot to do with the class of people  and the race of people down there.  He's got a backseat attitude towards the whole thing  and, man, there's like thousands of people down there  just sitting, waiting, and rotting. 
[00:07:00]  Why is it that it's days later  and we still look at the news  and we can see a shot of a huge group of people  with no leadership there  in the way of, like, National Guard or Army?  Why is it that we're working on almost a week  and we don't see this?  We still see thousands upon thousands of people  grouped up in an area where there is nothing, 
[00:07:30]  no one delivering food or water or anything.  It's beyond me.  I don't get it.  I don't understand why.  We were talking in the office  and I was like,  if there were 10,000 Al-Qaeda members  at the convention center in New Orleans,  do you think they'd have to say,  well, we need to move in resources  before the army was on the ground  doing something about that situation?  Now, obviously, they're not supposed to be hostile. 
[00:08:00]  They're refugees and not combatants.  But the fact of the matter is,  there is a way to move these resources in there immediately.  If that was a hostile presence,  an enemy terrorist that were held up  at the convention center or the Superdome,  guaranteed their place would be crawling with military.  Why can't this be done  and these people be given what they need to live? 
[00:08:30]  People are dying.  Again, this is going to be huge  in the way of lawsuits for years to come.  Another, you know,  more taxpayer burden  in the way of lawsuits  for people that were alive,  could have still been alive,  and are now dead  because they didn't get food and water in time.  Why was Bush spending his time  meeting with Alan Greenspan  about the economic impact of this thing  before the people are even out?  Why is he going to tour the disaster area 
[00:09:00]  when shit's still falling down around him?  You don't tour a disaster area  when the disaster is still happening.  You can't get an assessment  of how bad things are  when the badness hasn't stopped yet.  Do something huge.  Well, today he is.  He's going to be walking among the people, he said.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he's getting right there in New Orleans, I'm sure.  I'm certain.  He'll probably be in, like, Georgia.  Yeah.  Well, I got as close as I could. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  I see the suffering.  Stop taking people.  The Astrodome stopped taking people  after about 10,000 to 15,000 people.  They just said on TV 12,000 people.  12,000 people.  And they were planning on taking 25,000.  You know what the amazing thing is also?  The Superdome had,  they said,  about upwards of 25,000 to 30,000 people there  at the beginning  that were there for shelter.  They've shipped out well over 12,000.  12,000 are now at the Astrodome, 
[00:10:00]  but they've shipped out more  and they're trying to bring them  to other shelters elsewhere.  There's now over 30,000 people  at the Superdome.  There's more people there now  than when they started  trying to evacuate people out.  And it's just growing.  People are just walking right into the Superdome  at this point?  They're walking there  because now, obviously,  the people on the ground there  don't get the news that we're getting.  Right.  And the last thing they probably heard were,  hey, people are getting evacuated out  from the Superdome.  So all they know is to get there. 
[00:10:30]  Now they're getting there  and realizing there's no buses coming.  There's no food.  There's, you know,  we've heard on the news  the robberies, rapes,  the murders, the beatings.  And that's what they're walking into.  There are smaller pockets,  like what you see on the news  of the thousands and thousands of people  grouped in one area.  There are smaller pockets of,  you know, 10, 15 people,  a hundred people here and there  that are just trying to defend themselves,  scrounge up water.  A lot of these rooftop communities  they're talking about  are turning up on top of hotels 
[00:11:00]  from people that were in the hotels  that couldn't get out.  The staff is up and left.  And now these people are getting  what they're calling rooftop communities,  scrounging for food and water  and trying to hold off these marauders.  Is it true that the police force has quit  or part of the police force?  Yeah, I've gotten different.  I heard a number of 60% of the police  down there have basically said,  screw this.  Yeah, and then you hear from the government  that it's, you know, 20%.  But, you know, the truth lies  somewhere in between there. 
[00:11:30]  Somewhere in between, sure.  Of cops that have just given up,  they look around and go,  why am I bothering?  Why am I going to risk life and limb,  be away from my family?  The cops also have no resources.  That's what I was going to say.  You've got to think their families  are in dire need as well.  And the cops themselves  don't have changes of uniforms.  They don't have food.  They don't have water.  And what are they supposed to do?  They're victims in this also.  And now they're supposed  to uphold the law.  They're supposed to go after looters 
[00:12:00]  when they themselves  don't have anything  and have been...  A lot of people are saying,  you know,  well, the cops are joining the looters.  Some have.  I don't know.  Of course there are bad people  around here  that are going to be looting  and hurting other people.  But I think for the most part  a lot of these people  that are looting  are grabbing food and water  which is probably now gone.  You know?  I can't imagine  there's a store left  with any edible food in there  or drinkable water.  And it just...  For some reason  you always imagined 
[00:12:30]  that if something like this  happened to a major city  the government would be able  to swoop in  and take care of everything.  You've always heard that, you know?  This is an embarrassment  as far as this government goes.  This administration  that's in there.  It's an embarrassment.  The whole world's out there watching  and what are they seeing?  They're seeing  thousands upon thousands  of people dropping dead  on the streets  in these makeshift shelters.  And where is this rapid response? 
[00:13:00]  Where are the images  we've seen in Somalia  of cargo planes  dropping resources  down to these people  in open fields?  We've seen it.  We know it's possible.  Where is it?  Where's the open field  getting the big  C-130 flying over  just dropping food and water?  The two basics.  That's it.  Don't worry about clothing yet  or transportation out of there  but just enough  to keep the people breathing  until they can airlift them out 
[00:13:30]  or bus them out  or however else they're getting out.  Where is that?  They keep talking.  You listen to the FEMA people.  You listen to the Bush administration people.  They're saying  we're doing it.  We're getting people there.  Getting is already too late.  The people should have been there already  helping these people out.  Nothing.  You're just seeing huge,  huge pockets of people  with nothing.  And the Astrodome,  the buses are piling up now.  Yeah,  because they're not taking people.  They're not taking any more people. 
[00:14:00]  They're saying,  they got 12,000 people in there  and they got a whole bunch of buses  outside the Astrodome.  Full buses.  Full buses  and they don't know where to take these people  at this time.  Outside the Astrodome,  people sleeping now.  People are starting to sleep  outside the Astrodome now.  Now they're moving,  you know,  from the Superdome.  how bad is the problem  going to get in Houston  if they have to now turn people away,  have to find other shelter for them.  It is what they call  a clusterfuck.  And the solution doesn't seem to be  today or tomorrow. 
[00:14:30]  You know,  it should have been  the day before yesterday,  the day before that.  Somebody did a horrid job  of estimating what was needed  in New Orleans.  and no one,  you know,  anytime somebody tries to bring it up  to the administration or FEMA,  they say,  well,  now's not the time  for finger pointing.  No,  it is the time  because somebody is dropping the ball  and they're continuing to do so. 
[00:15:00]  Where's the help for these people?  You know,  the coverage finally got to me last night  because to me,  it's been so surreal  just watching this  and like you said on Monday,  it's kind of like  in a weird way,  a movie.  It's like a movie going on.  Yeah.  Because you watch all the coverage  and then I'll walk outside my apartment.  It's a beautiful sunny day in New York.  Birds are tweeting.  Yeah,  and people are just walking around.  They don't give a shit.  They really don't.  They're walking around  with their Starbucks  and their cell phones  like,  ah,  whatever.  Yeah.  You know,  it's kind of weird.  You watch the coverage for hours  and then you go outside 
[00:15:30]  and like you said,  yeah,  the birds are chirping.  Everything's fine.  The buses are running.  But it finally really,  really hit me  with wheelchair dead grandma.  How many times  did you see wheelchair dead grandma?  Oh my God.  And you know,  Oh my God.  Under the blanket  and you know  they pulled away that blanket  a little to show  granny's arm there  in the wheelchair.  Oh yeah.  Because she was totally covered  but it looks better  if you could see a little flesh.  And of course  all the news networks,  you know,  really,  you know,  I hate to say this  but really milking that shot  over and over and over again. 
[00:16:00]  How many times?  And hey,  you win.  You got me.  You got me.  Yeah,  that was a little much.  With the guy laying next to him  in the sheet.  Yeah,  in the sheet.  Because now they're going to  just start piling up  the body somewhere.  They'll take it among them  themselves  to start piling up  the dead body somewhere.  And then the front page  of the New York Times  has just a dead body floating  in I guess the canal.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Could be a street.  Yeah,  it could be a street.  You're right,  man.  It looks like it's somebody  the picture's taken  from a highway overpass.  And it looks like  another older person. 
[00:16:30]  It looks like another grandma  in old lady clothes  just face down  floating in water.  That's the front page  of the New York Times today.  Yeah.  And you look at these  front pages of these papers  here in New York  and you really think  you're looking at  another country.  Yeah,  a lot of people  are bringing up  the third world nation  and that is what it looks like.  You know,  you got a lot of black people  walking around  in a lot of garbage  with a lot of kids 
[00:17:00]  and they have nothing  and no help.  They're all very desperate.  It looks like Rwanda.  Looks like Somalia.  Only they're a lot  more well fed.  I'll give them that.  Jesus Christ.  There are some  of the fattest women  I've ever seen  on television  in New Orleans.  When they talk about  the obesity of this country  and you look around  and go,  I don't see that many fat people.  Boy,  are they bringing up  the average down there.  Goddamn,  after this disaster,  how about taking care  of the disaster  that is the people's 
[00:17:30]  eating habits down there?  Holy shit.  How many more people  could you get in a chopper  if you didn't have to take  five people  that took up  the weight of ten  on some of these helicopters?  Christ.  It was a white city  and the fatbacks.  You think it would take  this long?  No.  The truth of the matter is  I was thinking about that  on the way in today  and no.  You know what though?  They would have swooped right in.  I don't care if the streets  are blocked  and it's flooding  and stuff.  They would have found a way.  There's a weird thing  going on here though.  Is it the fact  that they're black  and is it a racial thing 
[00:18:00]  or is it just a class thing  with poor people?  These people,  obviously,  they're dirt poor.  I don't think it's racial.  I think it's a class thing.  I think it's the fact  that these people  are the poorest of the poor.  They don't have money.  These are the people  that probably couldn't get out.  Sure,  there are plenty  that could have.  I see a lot of  very healthy young men there  that could have  probably helped  a lot more people  get out  and decided not to.  That was very stupid.  But a lot of people  that we're seeing  are old people, 
[00:18:30]  people that are  way out of shape.  A lot of kids,  that's another thing.  Jesus Christ,  what is it with  the fucking poor  and the fact that  they've got to just  have 18 kids?  I was reading in the paper  this one woman,  they had her name,  her age,  and the fact that  she's toting 11  of her children  with her.  11.  But these,  you know,  whatever,  these are problems  that have been going on  for years and years  and years.  Yet these people,  very poor,  and I think that  does have a lot  to do with the fact  that they're not 
[00:19:00]  getting the help  that they needed.  If this was,  let's say,  a huge freak hurricane  that strong  hit somewhere  like Greenwich,  Connecticut,  and you're looking  at a bunch of  residents of Greenwich  walking the streets  like this,  do you honestly  believe that they  would be lacking  the essentials of life  in Greenwich?  I doubt it.  And I don't know,  who's giving the order  to not get the help 
[00:19:30]  in there?  Who's saying  they're poor,  we shouldn't send  the help?  It's never spoken.  I don't think it's  happening that way.  Never spoken.  But there just  didn't seem to be  the importance  with the administration  to get the help  in there immediately.  You know,  you said they're  meeting with Greenspan  and weighing the economic.  Yeah.  That's the way it's done.  No one ever sits  in a room and goes,  all right,  well,  they're poor and black,  all right,  fuck them.  It's like,  well,  we do have to weigh  the economic thing,  and the other person  in the room,  and he'll go,  yeah,  no,  we do have to  kind of see that,  and it just kind 
[00:20:00]  of goes unsaid.  It goes,  it's unspoken,  but it's there.  I mean,  for some reason,  these people  aren't worth as much  as other people,  and they're being  treated as such,  and there's no denying it.  You're seeing it  on the news  every goddamn day now  for the past few days.  It's what's happening.  It's just the way it is  right now.  It's really sickening  the way you're responsible.  It is.  It's an embarrassment.  There are ways  to get the resources  to these people. 
[00:20:30]  It's just not being done.  And if it isn't  this class thing,  if it isn't  this subconscious  little thing  that's going on,  then it's the fact  that our government  is so fucked up  that they can't  coordinate a rescue  of their own people.  Is that what we're living  in?  We've been,  you know,  we've been blindsided  again by the fact  that our government  can't take care of us  like we thought they would.  We aren't as secure  as we thought we were.  And the fact is  that a natural disaster  can roll in,  wipe out an entire city, 
[00:21:00]  and the government  isn't going to respond  immediately.  We're not going to get  the pallets full of food  and water rolling off  of the C-130s.  It's not happening.  The fact of the matter is,  no, it isn't.  Where is it?  The tsunami  was handled better.  Yeah.  It really was.  It was more organized,  the effort to get in there  and clean up  and get relief  or whatever,  because the world,  I guess,  was involved with it.  But it was more organized  than this seems to be.  You're hearing  a lot of excuses 
[00:21:30]  by these people.  You're hearing excuses  and any excuse  that Washington  can come up with  for not having help  in there  is drown out  listening to one person  that is actually there  talking about  how they don't have  food and water.  There isn't one excuse  that overrides  their misery  that's going on  down there.  And it's inexcusable.  How is it not  the pallets of water  brought in?  It really is.  Where's the fucking water?  It's water.  You're not talking  about flying in  Cristal and dropping it. 
[00:22:00]  It's fucking bottled water.  Drop it.  There are plenty  of open fields  near these people.  What are they waiting for?  There's no excuse.  All right,  let's go to the phone  and say hi to Matt.  Matt,  what's going on today?  Ramon,  get me to the Astrodome.  You're a tool.  That was so  goddamn funny  yesterday, Jimmy.  You are a complete ass  and I loved it.  Yeah,  if you're listening  to the replays  over the weekend  on this channel, 
[00:22:30]  make sure you check out  the Star Wars bit  if you didn't hear it  when it ran yesterday.  Some people say  in one of the top five  bits we've done  on XM.  Yeah.  We interviewed this guy  that does a one-man  Star Wars show.  In the beginning,  it was like,  yeah, whatever.  But it turns out  to be one of the best  bits we've done so far.  Did you happen to see  Shepard Smith  and his well-choreographed  reveal of the dead body  behind him?  Yeah.  20 times they showed  that one.  This is another thing.  We goof on the media 
[00:23:00]  all the time  and I like Shepard Smith's  coverage of this whole thing.  He's one of the few  high-profile guys  that are actually there,  not on the outskirts.  The guy is in the shit  and you've got to  respect him for that.  A lot of these TV stations  have armed security now.  I was reading in the paper  this morning.  Armed security,  24 hours a day.  But Shepard Smith just...  Shep's right there.  He just went with it.  He started on Bourbon Street  filming pretty much  the balcony we did  our broadcast from  during Mardi Gras  and now he's moved  on to that overpass. 
[00:23:30]  They've moved a lot  of him out  but he's right by  the Superdome.  How are those guys  eating?  I don't know, man.  That's a good question.  Kind of like that old  Sam Kinison bit, you know?  Yeah, the cameraman  could give him a sandwich.  Yeah.  I mean, come in.  So, Shepard Smith  yesterday did a report  from the overpass  and it was very dramatic.  He sounded very somber,  very low tone to his voice  and you could watch  almost like a movie 
[00:24:00]  being directed.  The camera movements.  It started out  with Shepard Smith  maybe facing,  let's say he was  facing west  and the camera's  facing east  looking at him.  Then they did this whole speech,  he gave this whole speech  as the scene  completely turned around  to where now Shepard's  facing the other way  and the cameraman's  facing Shepard  and Shepard gives a speech  about refugees  on the highway  and then he steps  to the side  exposing a dead body 
[00:24:30]  that was blocked  by him,  by himself,  laying on the ground.  Do you know how many times  they must have worked  that shot out  to make sure  the big reveal  didn't come  until he stepped  to the side?  It looks all spontaneous.  It looks like he's  speaking very somber  and then he steps  to the side  but you don't get  that shot  without rehearsing it  over and over  and over again  and I would have loved  to have seen  the rehearsal.  No, Shep,  Shep,  the corpse is still  in the shot. 
[00:25:00]  You've got to step  a little to the left  and that was  absolutely happening.  Was it a tape piece?  Yeah,  it was a tape piece.  Yep.  Today is going to be  the day of the dead bodies.  They started yesterday  but today that's  you're going to see  just...  You think dead body day?  Today is dead body day.  Today is dead body day.  That's going to be  the big thing  they're going to show  over and over again  because they kind of  felt this out a little bit  yesterday on the news.  Can they take it?  Can they take it?  We'll show the grandma.  We'll show this  and the Shepard thing  but today...  Let's get the reaction.  We'll figure out  if they can take  the dead bodies. 
[00:25:30]  Today is definitely  dead body day.  You watch.  You watch.  All the money we waste  on bullshit  and then there's  100,000 or more  residents of this country  that need water  and just fucking  get them what they need.  It's really...  It's sickening  and it just makes you  want to smack  somebody's face.  This is just New Orleans  we're talking about.  Mississippi is a whole  different story, man.  At least they can walk  to shelters  and Mississippi  they're starting to get  power back in certain areas. 
[00:26:00]  You see a lot of heavy  equipment moving  a lot of this shit.  You know, that's fine.  That's pretty much  the aftermath  of a pretty bad hurricane.  What's happening  in Mississippi.  That's what's happened.  It's happened before.  People have dealt with it.  They've rebuilt.  You get your dead.  It happens.  It's a horrible thing.  But the situation  in New Orleans  is something so far  from that.  It's so far from that.  You have people now  that are still  just stranded  without the essentials  and they're not getting it. 
[00:26:30]  And you could say  what you want.  The looters  they should have left  this, that.  What are they doing  there still?  Walk out, do that.  It's not even  you can't even  sit there  and try to blame  the people anymore.  Whatever.  Yeah, a lot of them  they're fucking assholes.  They should have left.  You're right.  But the biggest issue here  is the fact that  they're not getting  the essentials  to live  from the government.  Five days.  Five days. 
[00:27:00]  I understand the first  24 hours  maybe even the first  48 hours.  We're up to like what  the fifth day here.  Yeah.  And these government  officials they knew  the situation  was going to deteriorate.  Yep.  And it did.  Well that's another thing  conspiracy theorists  sometimes I like  I like thinking  like the conspiracy theorists.  I think this is a great  social experiment  for the government  to look at how  a city comes apart  at the fucking seams  when disaster strikes  and you let it go 
[00:27:30]  for a little longer  than it should.  It gives you a good  indication of  what might happen  after maybe  an atomic  an atomic attack  biological attack  something that would  close down  and panic a city  this kind of gives you  a little bit of research  you know.  That would be a tough  one to bring up  in a meeting.  Yeah.  You know I got an idea.  What?  Do I believe that?  No.  But but  you know  like like people 
[00:28:00]  are saying  people have said  in the past  well why shouldn't  we kind of use  some of the research  that the Nazis  came up with  during World War II  it's there  you know  they did some of  these horrific experiments  and you know  why don't we just  take a look at it  and see if there's  anything we can use there  and people have always  said are you insane  that's crazy  well I'm sure  there are certain people  in certain branches  of the government  that are looking  at this and going  since it's happening  why don't we really  take a close look  at how an American city 
[00:28:30]  comes apart  at the seams  when they're faced  with something like this  who knows you know  behind those closed doors  anything is possible  certainly is  if they haven't  thought of it before  I'm sure they will be now  after that brilliant suggestion  Washington  looking at you  as a viewer  it's strange  because at this point  if one of the news channels  is not on New Orleans  I'm out  I'm out  out  Baton Rouge  I don't care  Opie what do you do  when they start  talking about gas prices  get out  out  Mississippi  out  Opie 
[00:29:00]  Iraq today  out  CNN  what do you got for me  it's all about New Orleans  to me  it's all about New Orleans  as soon as they go somewhere else  I'm out  talking head  out  out  although like  you know  the flyover in Mississippi  where they're pointing out  all this  the stuff yesterday  was  yeah that's pretty  that was pretty  incredible  incredible footage  I think  I gotta say one thing though  like when you have  however many people here  trapped on rooftops  I mean it does have to be  difficult to get to 
[00:29:30]  a lot of people  especially when the  helicopter was shot at  maybe they've suspended  certain  they did  they're saving people  they're saving thousands  of people  you know  but it's just not enough  well the animals  that are shooting  at rescuers  they absolutely  need to be shot  on the spot  by the National Guardsmen  without hesitation  they just need to be  shot and dealt with  oh they're doing that now  that's it  there was a graphic  that just hit the TV  eight looters  were killed  in one area  bravo 
[00:30:00]  one area  one area  just one little town  bravo  they killed eight  yeah there's a few  quite a few thousand  National Guardsmen  they said shoot to kill  looters  shoot to kill  there you go  that order came out  let's go to the phone  say hi to Mike in Jersey  Mike what's up  hey did you see  how they're doing  like the locals  spin on the hurricane  like it could hit  New York  no  I have not heard  that at all  the hurricane  has passed us by  sir  they said 
[00:30:30]  they could  on Fox TV  they said  how it could  happen in New York  and to get a kit  ready and shit  oh you mean  for the next hurricane  yeah  I thought you meant  this hurricane  this hurricane  is somewhere in Alaska  no no  Nova Scotia  it's somewhere  way up there  I think we're  a little too far north  to really get  the brunt  of a five  you know  and again  New Orleans  is below sea level  the biggest problem  why is Bush  enlisting the help  of people  to open their  hearts and wallets 
[00:31:00]  I don't remember  a fucking  a kitty being  taken up  to send troops  over to Afghanistan  or Iraq  both of which  I supported  so I'm not  why is it  you don't need  donations then  and benefits then  why is he relying  on people's generosity  now  how about the federal  government  fucking ponying up  the money  how about I donate  every three months  I donate  and I make  a big donation  on April  April 15th  how about the  government  absolutely  goes in  you don't see  them grubbing  up dollars  for an invasion  right 
[00:31:30]  you're absolutely  right  we have the money  we're not a poor  country  we have the money  get the troops  there  like I said  before  if it was  10,000  Al Qaeda  sitting in the  convention center  you'd figure out  a way  it wouldn't be  five days  the press  wouldn't be  going  Mr. President  Al Qaeda  terrorists  10,000 of them  are in the  convention center  in New Orleans  what's your plan  well  we're sending  ships in five 
[00:32:00]  days  they should be  there  you'd have  resources there  you'd have  soldiers there  they would have  the resources  they need  to survive  to do their  job  you know  because that's  one of the  excuses I heard  too  you can't  just bring  troops in  you need  some kind  of an  infrastructure  of communication  and what not  for these  troops that  would come  in  well what if  it's a  national  emergency  that you  cannot wait  five days  for  it is  like an  invasion  it absolutely  is  I'm putting 
[00:32:30]  it in terms  that the  government  would understand  they would  drop these  soldiers in  in a second  this is live  pictures of the  Superdome  so are they  someone explain  what's going  on at the  Superdome  they're getting  the people  out of there  but more  people are  just going  in there  more people  are coming  in and they  can take  out  so on  Sunday  when that  line was  forming to  get everyone  into the  Superdome  that was  well organized  they had  people  checking  and all  those people  I'm assuming  now are just  gone saying  hey this is 
[00:33:00]  too dangerous  for me  so the people  technically have  taken over the  Superdome is  what I'm thinking  yeah  they still have  national guard  troops around  the Superdome  trying to  keep people  organized  but the  numbers are  ridiculous  I mean  these guys  are so  outnumbered  you saw  that huge  walkway  to the entrance  of the Superdome  I was watching  that last night  just packed  with thousands  upon thousands  of people  waiting to get  on these buses  and it was a joke  you saw  thousands of people 
[00:33:30]  and then you'd see  a few buses  pull up  people I guess  were getting on  the buses  as the buses  pulled away  and it did not  make a dent  you could not  even tell  anyone  had left  that crowd  and this was  supposed to  get people  out  this would  have to go  on for weeks  weeks  before you  would actually  see results  and a lot  of those people  would be dead  right  and in the  meantime  more people  are showing up  so more people  are showing up  than are leaving  they're not 
[00:34:00]  getting food  and water  and the body  count's just  going up now  fast  because now  you've got  people that  haven't had  water or food  in days  yeah  you know  so  you've got  people in  these hot  stifling conditions  dehydrating  the elderly  and the kids  are dropping  dead  I can't take  the kids  crying on TV  anymore  it's fucking  brutal  fucking brutal  because they have  no clue  what the hell  is going on  I just don't get it  on any level  I can't remember  one comedy show  I'd recommend  sometime soon  if anyone can get  a chance to go  see Paul Mooney 
[00:34:30]  if you ever want  to see Paul Mooney  this is probably  a great time  to do it  I'm sure he's got  a nice vicious tirade  let's say hi to Pete  on Long Island  Pete what's up  morning boys  I don't know  if anybody caught  was it  Greta Van  Ice Face  last night  she was interviewing  a doctor  who said  they had  6 murders  12 rapes  1 suicide  an MP shot  all inside  the Superdome  his doctor said  the last thing  he said  he is not  going back in there  it's too dangerous  yeah well  a lot of the people 
[00:35:00]  that were sent  to help  not a lot  because we don't  have numbers here  we're not going  to try to like  spin shit  but we've been  hearing a lot  of the people  that went down  there to try  to save people  are like  screw this  we've got a guy  with an AK-47  or whatever it was  shooting at you  yeah  well CNN has got  a call going on  right now  there's sniper fire  with police  on top of the  police precinct  the Superdome  right now  is like an episode  of Oz  you just don't  want to  you do not  want to be in there  man  oh by the way  Jimmy  I hate you Jim 
[00:35:30]  why is that  sir  I'm sitting  inside  Sloan Kettering  the cancer hospital  in New York  last night  oh I got your  email  yeah  what's up  Pete go ahead  I'm sitting  there listening  my father's  up in surgery  I'm surrounded  by cancer patients  family of cancer patients  they're all weeping  and here I am  listening to  remove  suck his black cock  yeah that Star Wars  bit  I'm telling you  I took every effort  to hold  but you know  you gotta laugh 
[00:36:00]  so hard  you gotta hold  it back  cause you don't  wanna make a scene  mother fucker  I couldn't stand you  I'm glad you enjoyed  it man  here's the deal  with the Star Wars  bit I think it's on  foundrymusic.com  and opianthony.com  it will be replayed  over the weekend  we replay all the shows  from the week  on Saturday and Sunday  and of course  another source is  audible.com  our shows are  available up there  for a small cost  so it's a bit  you definitely want to  check out if you  haven't heard yet  alright Pete  thank you  watch it out  alright  and just the troops 
[00:36:30]  entered to stop looters  yeah  you have to stop looting  but it's amazing how  troops should enter  and bring supplies  first  before they fucking  stop looting  is important  you gotta stop it  but property  can't be protected  above getting  30,000 people  I think the reality  is they don't even  know where to begin  they don't know  where to begin  they're trying to  save lives  and then they got  the looting  and then it's just  it's crazy  you can drop shit  in too  you can drop  food and water in  you think that'll 
[00:37:00]  calm people down  a little bit  absolutely  it'll keep them  breathing  until you come up  with a better idea  perhaps  alright  do we have that  doctor audio  from last night  yeah listen to this  I did hear this  we're joined now  we're joined now  on the phone  by Dr. Charles  Burnell  he's an emergency  room doctor  who has been  working inside  the superdome  was it worse  than what you  expected  when you first  said put in  that superdome  I realize  you know  with the level  of violence  you know  it seems like  everyone's  worst nightmare  but were you  expecting that  or was it  beyond what  you can even  put in words  the situation 
[00:37:30]  there  the first odor  is that of  urine and feces  and when you  walk in the place  it's a very  unstable  very high tension  very dangerous  environment  and from the time  we were in there  from the people  grabbing on us  and trying to get  attention  and trying to get  help  and trying to show  us their loved  ones that needed  help  to the time  we got out of  there and could  maintain any safe  distance at all  but that barrier  was completely broken  every time there  was an incident  that broke out  National Guard 
[00:38:00]  had to tend to that  and defuse that  situation  which left us  uncovered the entire  time  and it got to the  point where  as medical personnel  we had to make  a decision  of whether or not  to stay  without protection  or without adequate  protection  for some time  and put ourselves  at risk  and continue  to take care  or try to take  care of these people  or whether we  needed to get out  wow  wow  wow  wow  wow  we got more  from the doctor  the good doctor  were there actually  weapons brought  into the Superdome 
[00:38:30]  I mean what's  the violence  the actual violence  inside the Superdome  well we had  several murders  we had three murders  last night  we had a total  of six rapes  last night  we had the day  before  I think there were  three or four murders  there were half a dozen  rapes that night  we had one suicide  that night  last night  we had one  military police shot  in an incident  through the leg  which we were able  to medivac out  in the middle of the night  and that has been  our biggest problem  with getting the medivacs  out  because we just  could not  logistically  get those people  out of there 
[00:39:00]  quick enough  all of our centers  and all of our beds  were overtaken  with sick patients  and again  we ran out of resources  we did not have  oxygen  we did not have  any medications  to speak of  except for some  breathing medicines  which we couldn't  even use  because we had  no oxygen  to run the machines  New Orleans  Mayor leashes out  at feds  over lack of  sorry  lashes  Jesus  New Orleans  Mayor lashes out  at feds  over lack of  A  that's the latest  headline  did you see the chant  help us  fuck you Ray 
[00:39:30]  fuck you Ray  on CNN  they were showing that  a couple of times  actually  Ray  yeah  the mayor  over there  of New Orleans  yeah  there he is  Ray  they were chanting  fuck you Ray  and CNN  just let it fly  they're letting a lot  of curses fly  on this one  I don't think the SEC  is going to be  cracking down  on the news  organizations  looks like  local government  was too busy  looking good  on those damn  floats every year  they're not doing  much behind the scenes 
[00:40:00]  to make sure  something like this  wouldn't get out  of control  the local guys  what is the mayor  supposed to do  when the city  he runs  his business from  is destroyed  all he can do  is ask for help  and he hasn't  really gotten it  we got one more  clip from the doctor  are you going  back  not until there  is a lot  better security  down there  and I'm not  putting my life  in that type  of a dangerous  situation 
[00:40:30]  I would love  to help out  to try to  evacuate  as many  of these people  as possible  especially the ones  with medical  necessity  but until I can  ensure that  there is  I'm not putting  my life  in a significantly  dangerous  situation  as I was  before  I will not  be back  in the super  dunk  doctor  thank you  very much  I just want  to jump in  real fast  Dallas has  offered the  reunion  arena  what is that  I don't know  I just got a  thought here  that's all  they're offering 
[00:41:00]  up these  stadiums and  arenas and  domes that  they don't need  for real  sporting events  for real  sporting events  yeah  god forbid  you put off  a game or  two  it's like  I'm seeing  names of  arenas and  stuff  never heard  of it  and stadiums  hey it's  great obviously  but it's like  what  who plays  at that  one  last night  I saw  Detroit's  mayor  got on  and offered  up Detroit  to which  I guess  some of the  survivors said  I'm not  crazy  but it was  kind of 
[00:41:30]  refreshing  to see  a black  mayor  of a city  get up  there and  say hey  these are  our people  we're absolutely  throwing the  doors open  for them  I'm noticing  another silence  not just  the administration  making up  excuses for  where the  help is  but where  where are  the black  leaders  where's  the  all these  black  baptist  churches  that have  these  buses  have room  in their  churches  to bring  these people  there  and put  them up  how about 
[00:42:00]  ten families  in a church  to put  them up  all over  the country  everywhere  get a  caravan  going  of your  church  buses  get down  there  and start  picking some  of these  people up  and giving  them a place  to stay  just the fact  that in the  federal disaster  we have to  start thinking  of church  buses  it's just  horrible  how this  was handled  but not only  is there a  silence from  the government  but even  the black  leadership  that's why  I'm saying  it's not so  much a race  thing as it  is a class  thing  because these  people are 
[00:42:30]  just looked at  as trash  and even  people in the  black community  are going  you know  eh  we'll see what  the government  does  you know  before we  step in  and pick up  the ball  here  doctors  don't feel  protected  enough  to take  care of  people  I mean  how do  you not  have a couple  of armed  guards  on a doctor  it just stinks  we got a couple  of people on the  phones  that strongly  disagree with us  Mike in New York  Mike what's up  hey what's up  fellas  hey listen  first of all  I just want to  say that you guys  are awesome  second  Jimmy you're an  absolute asshole  oh yeah

[00:45:30]  this morning  let's take one  example  your public  speaking ability  let's start  there  open area  in that field  well Jesus  Christ  if there was  an open field  there would be  people in it  if you drop  it you kill  a people  if you drop  it you break  the water  Anthony  if you're so  fucking smart  why are you  a goddamn  radio host  run for president  for Christ's sake  are you  dude  dude  dude  dude  hey  hey  hey  hey  are you  actually  holding on  to the thing  you can't  criticize the 
[00:46:00]  president  because you  can't do it  are you  actually  saying that  you fucking  grown man  is that your  argument  if you know  better you  should be  president  you dope  did he hang  up  yeah I didn't  do that  and you know  something  douchebag  I've seen  plenty of  open real  estate  where thousands  of people  are  open grass  fields  these are the  people that  came out  of the water  douchebag  he's saying  where do you  drop them  there's no  dry ground  what did  did you watch  the news  at all  have you seen  the scenes  of thousands 
[00:46:30]  of people  and plenty  of dry ground  around them  that's where  they were  walking to  asshole  dry ground  what an  ass  the funniest  part of that  call  he called  you a  liberal  I know  I don't know  if he got  to that point  but it was  under the comments  and I'm like  wow  I am the  furthest  thing from a  liberal  the furthest  thing from a  liberal  but people  don't seem  to understand  it doesn't  mean that I  have to accept  everything the  right feeds you  that the fact 
[00:47:00]  that you can't  there are people  that feel they  cannot criticize  the president  or they will be  this liberal  democrat  so they just  blindly follow  look at what he  does and never  ever criticize  and anyone  that does  criticize him  is an  unpatriotic  piece of  shit that  should be  beaten and  thrown out  of the  country  well here's  the bottom  line  this  administration  and I've  been pretty  pro-Bush  has handled  this situation  fucking 
[00:47:30]  despicably  and to the  mush mouth  disaster that  just called  in  you're a  fucking  idiot  and you  don't know  what you're  talking about  and that's  all I have  to say  you're dumb  and I'm  not  I love the  comment that  the state  is responsible  and the  federal government  isn't responsible  what  what  why the  fuck  pay federal  taxes  why are you  paying federal  taxes  why am I  talking with  apple in my  mouth  and once the  state asks  for help  then it's the  federal government's  responsibility  this guy is  probably talking  about the fact 
[00:48:00]  that the  federal government  troops cannot  swoop into your  state uninvited  and start working  on things  that is true  but once the  state asks  which they did  immediately  then the  federal government  yes it is their  responsibility to  come in and  help  ass  head  all right  front page  you're not  the president  how do you  know  why don't you  run for president  by gum  he's given  me an idea  front pages  across america  the houston  chronicle  a desperate  sos

[00:49:30]  faster and why  aren't people  getting the help  they need  katie people are  getting the help  they need  and i understand  the frustrations  that are being  expressed by  some of the  local emergency  managers  gotta love the  today show  is that the  today show  people are  getting the help  they need  help  help  help  cue video  all you hear is  help in the  background  wow  and this is a  nice picture  by the way  of condoleezza  rice  uh wednesday  night  uh because she  took in spam  a lot  here in the  city  are you kidding

[00:50:30]  spam a lot  tickets  it's a very  hard ticket  jimmy  yes  as south  drowns  rice soaks  in new york  that is a  great headline  unbelievable  back to the uh  tape here  the today show  let's explain  what's going  on here  um  the video  they're playing  is this guy  saying you know  that help is  on the way  and and all  that  yeah  the situation  is getting  slightly better  the video  they're playing  is from days  ago  oh really  just to really 
[00:51:00]  hammer their  point home  and really  make this guy  squirm  let's get back  to it  frustrations  that are being  expressed by  some of the  local emergency  managers  and the mayor  and others  this is an  ongoing disaster  this disaster  did not just  end when  Katrina left  and went on  to become  a big  thunderstorm  in the  Ohio Valley  somewhere  and what  we're doing  here is we  have ongoing  relief efforts  for example  the Superdome  we're feeding  those people  we have  truckloads  and convoys  of supplies  going there  and I think  what's happening  is we can  continue to  see the 
[00:51:30]  disaster  unfold  and every  urban search  and rescue  team  is literally  going from  house to  house to  house  and then back  again  let me ask  you about  local law  enforcement  apparently  they have  not been  able to  maintain  order  in New  Orleans  some kind  of a much  stronger  federal response  is needed  when will  the National  Guard be  deployed  and when  will they  get there  and how  many  the National  Guard  has been  deployed  the  president  has given  me  authority  to tap  into the  military  and I  have  General  Honoré  of the  First  Army  here 
[00:52:00]  and he's  doing an  incredibly  good job  in very  difficult  circumstances  we're ramping  up the numbers  of National  Guard  and the numbers  of boots  on the ground  and by Sunday  I'll have  30,000  National Guard  troops  to secure  the city  make it safe  for my rescue  and urban search  and rescue  and medical  teams to get  in there  and help  people  and also  the relief  teams  that are  helping  do the  evacuations  so we're  securing  the city  the general  is doing  a great  job  and we're  going to  fix that  problem  and stop  that  ball  list  one of the 
[00:52:30]  funny things  I saw  last night  in the news  was Anderson  Cooper  interviewing  this family  that had  found their  baby  and their  last name  is like  B-R-E-A-U-X  you know  how that's  pronounced  down there  bro  and he  actually  said  good luck  Mr. Bro  to the guy  I wish we had  yeah  it was 
[00:53:00]  I was  roaring  I wish  the mister  wasn't in  there  but it was  good luck  Mr. Bro  that's very  good  gotta know  the show  to understand  that one  alright  Michael Brown  why response  has taken  so long  Mr. Brown  I don't mean  to belabor  the point  but  we knew  for several  days  that this  hurricane  was going  to hit  to say  that by  Sunday  you'll have  30,000  National Guardsmen  on the ground  it seems  like a  pretty 
[00:53:30]  long lag  time  in terms  of actually  having them  on site  well  again  it's a  growing  and continuing  disaster  you know  before the  hurricane  struck  I came  down here  personally  and  rode the  storm  out in  Baton Rouge  of course  I have  not near  the problems  that some  of these  disaster victims  had  so I'm  not trying  to make  a comparison  there  but we got  here  we had  all of our  rescue teams  the medical  teams  pre-deployed  ready to go  the hurricane 
[00:54:00]  hit  the disaster  continued to  unfold  and as it  unfolded  we continued  to bring  more and more  teams in here  I have to tell  you though  that the  lawlessness  and the  crime that's  occurring  did surprise  us  and we are  bringing in  additional  National Guard  troops to  secure that  so that we  can continue  the rescue  and relief  efforts  I haven't  seen Boston  opening up  their doors  to any  refugees  they're actually  busing people 
[00:54:30]  from Boston  down to the  Superdome  I believe  I got  Boston's  response  to that  food and  water  getting to  the Superdome  what about  simple things  like food  and water  it seems  that many  people still  haven't gotten  those essential  supplies  why is that  well  that's a  frustrating  issue for me  because  I mean I  can sit here  and read off  all the stats  of you know  214 truckloads 
[00:55:00]  of water  going to  New Orleans  each truckload  can provide  water for  5,000 people  we've provided  food to  the people  in the convention  center so that  they've gotten  at least one  if not two  meals every  single day  we're doing  that not just  in New Orleans  but throughout  Alabama and  Mississippi too  so I get  frustrated as  everyone else  does when they  hear the stories  because what  we're doing  is literally  going individual  to individual  and as more  individuals continue  to manifest  themselves  as they come  out of their  homes or wherever 
[00:55:30]  it's safe  that they've been  hiding  away from  the storm  we have to  get to those  individuals  on an individual  basis and get  food to them  too  it's just  a massive  process that  we're undertaking  here to take  care of every  single one of  those individuals  man  how many  thousands of  people are  going to end  up dead  from this  in New  Orleans alone  well I  don't want to  give out any  numbers right  now Opie  but I would  say many  many thousands  I don't even  like to speculate  because I'm not  the president  right  I ain't the 
[00:56:00]  president  you know where  they're going to  find a lot of  dead people  in those houses  once that water  level's brought  down you're just  going to find some  bloated bodies  in there  a lot of these  people you got to  figure a lot of  people especially  old and the very  young weren't able  to climb up into  their attics at  all so they  probably just died  on the first  floors the ones  that could climb  into their attics  think of how  many people  probably couldn't  cut through their  roof in time  suffocated and  suffocated with 
[00:56:30]  this stifling  heat you know  what an attic  is like when  it's 95 degrees  outside you  don't last in  there very long  at all and  unless you have  some kind of  tools up there  to cut a hole  in there or  are able to  lift a vent  off of the  roof or even  know that you  can do something  like that you're  done so I think  that's where  they're going to  find a lot of  these people in  their houses  man one more  question to michael  brown here  head of fema  on the today  show a little  while ago  and finally mr  brown what can  you say to people 
[00:57:00]  listening right now  in terms of when  the situation will  be brought under  control  i think we'll  start seeing dramatic  improvements over  the next several  days  the military i think  will be an incredibly  good asset for us  to be able to use  here  all the assets  of the department  of homeland security  are here to be  able to help us  i think we're  going to see  again as the  disaster begins  to settle down  the floodwaters  begin to recede  and we begin to  find out exactly  where people are  and get into  those neighborhoods  again house by 
[00:57:30]  house i think  we'll see a  dramatic improvement  over the next  several days  oh we can only  hope right  yeah  oh is that  one of the  explosions happening  yeah  yeah it looks  like a big fire  looks like a  massive fire  some kind of  chemical plant  seems to have  exploded  that's what  just throw  everything in  there  like a  schwarzenegger  movie  now  is that 
[00:58:00]  that thing  again  the same thing  that fucking  fell yesterday  just fucking  fell again  and i have a  boot on my  foot  cocksucker  you have a  what on your  foot  holy shit  you're wearing  a booty  why are you  wearing a ski  boot  because he's  got an injured  ankle  what fell  same thing  that fell  what is it  because i can't  see it from my  angle  oh it's a  panel  i thought it was  that big like  pylon or  whatever  that thing is  huge  is it  there you go 
[00:58:30]  fucking fix it  don't kick it  with your bad  foot jimmy  it's like a  hatch  it's a big  hatch  the heck is  that  it's the second  time it almost  hit my foot  can they  fucking screw  it in  jeez  well they're  studying it  what's your  booty for  we got someone  looking at it  right now  through the  little boot  let's  it's all  fucked up  is it all  fucked up  or  yeah  i almost  need surgery  but i don't  i'm close 
[00:59:00]  chris what's  going on  i wish you  guys would go  back to a  comedy show  and quit being  so serious  i can't believe  i actually agree  with sniffing  but it's just  killing me  shut up  stupid  chris  well i mean  come on  shut up  we know what  you mean  we don't care  did you listen  to yesterday's  show  yeah  okay  now now  at the beginning  of the show  we talked about  what is uh  let me think  um oh yeah  the most important  story in the  country right now  for about an 
[00:59:30]  hour  and then  didn't we move  on to other  things  didn't we move  on sir  sir  didn't we move  on to other  things  do it the  second third  hour  no it's very  difficult to come  on and do a  show when a  story like this  is happening  and not talk  about it  don't you  understand how  this works  it's front page  news of every  paper in the  country  it's very hard  to do a show  that talks about  current events  and and not  hit on this  first  i'm not trying to  slam you guys  but no you 
[01:00:00]  are  i drive to work  i listen to it  all day  at work  i listen to  msnbc  all of these  different things  and that's all  it is  so what do you  want us to do  you want us to  shove wiffle ball  bats up girls  twats today  for you  absolutely  you're a douche  bag  you don't get  it  put on something  else  put on a comedy  tape  i don't know  what to tell you  until we touch  on something  else  it's one of the  biggest stories  to hit american  and who knows  probably our  lifetimes  we had fun 
[01:00:30]  yesterday with  the star wars  guy and then  i enjoyed the  conversation we  had about  jimmy's little  love letters  and walking  around with the  stereo  with the radio  the boombox  and then experiences  like trying to  ask girls out  we touched on  other things  and it was very  fun yesterday  i listened to  the replay  but there is no  way we can get  on the air  at seven in the  morning here in  new york  and after watching  the news and  reading the papers  all day and not  hit on this  don't you  don't you get 
[01:01:00]  it  some people will  just never get  it  some people will  never get what  this show is about  mike in georgia  what's up  hey what's up  man i just  wanted to bitch  a little bit  about some of  these assholes  that are calling  in fucking  running their  mouth like you  guys are giving  people a good  venue to vent  and rant a little  bit but until  these motherfuckers  opinions mean  something they  should shut the  fuck up  unless they want  a phony zoo  show where we  come in and  we're wacky and  zany no matter  what's happening  in the news i  mean that's not  this show this 
[01:01:30]  show is is what  we were thinking  about on a daily  basis and what's  affecting us and  and i i believe the  rest of the country  that's listening  and and we talk  about it it's not  all about a fucking  dick joke when  when shit's going  on and those zoo  crews won't even  give you a real  opinion either way  they're like no  no you gotta take  care of those uh  people down there  let's just i hope  they're okay hey  listen coming up we  got the weather and  the news they're  fucking fraudulent on  every level not just  comedically is that  what he wants is to  just not even touch  on it and just come  up with jokes and  gags that's phony 
[01:02:00]  we're not phony sorry  this is what's hitting  us today this is  what's hitting us  sorry i i we saw  dead people on the  news last night uh  we're a little bit  affected i don't think  people get the show  sometimes i don't think  they i think they think  it's a pure like comedy  show because we goof  around ninety nine  percent of the time  that that one percent  of the time where we  talk about shit that's  affecting us uh they  don't get that there's  always been a serious  angle to this radio show  and that's what amazes  me when uh the critics 
[01:02:30]  out there you know  attack us and our own  listeners attack us it's  like if you've been  listening since the  beginning there's always  been a serious angle  not a huge chunk of the  show i'm not going to  try to you know try to  pat ourselves on the  back here but when it's  deserved we go down the  serious road for a while  we always have done that  but uh you know article  after article shock jock  shock jock shock jock all  they're good for is uh  having a couple have sex  in st pat's the show is  so much more than that so  much more and even 
[01:03:00]  though one of the  biggest uh stories is  going on that's really  serious yesterday we  still squeezed in  probably over two hours  of comedy probably  probably two hours of  of the the funny i like  to call the funny the  funny but man we have a  huge listener base and  they're affected by what's  going on in front of them  on tv that's all look  every channel every channel  has it every newspaper on  the front page here it is  kentucky desperation a  cauldron of anarchy that's 
[01:03:30]  coming in from uh the star  tribune twin cities los  angeles times new orleans  slides into chaos u.s  scrambles to send troops  new york post uh angelino  jolie loses shoe in hotel  even the post did i say that  angelo angelo i gotta stand  up now even the post has a  serious uh headline today  look at their front page  they're not even fucking  around did i say angelino

[01:04:30]  saved you wouldn't need dry roads if we  had our flying vehicles that were  promised us yeah they could have  just been hovering above almost  every story on the front page of the  times is about this every story on  the new york times has a picture of a  body just floating there dead uh san  francisco san francisco chronicle i  took your a that you missed on your  joke and edited to frisco angelino  jolie i just said san francisco  anarchy anger desperation that's their

[01:08:00]  you see that picture though you simply  get chills every time you see these poor  individuals as jack capperty just  pointed out so tragically so many of  these people almost all of them that we  see are so poor and they're so black and  this is going to raise lots of questions  for people who are watching this story  unfold  take a quick break more of our special  coverage right after this there was a  pause there where he went  uh-oh did i just say so black so black 
[01:08:30]  jack capperty was on just before him and  he was talking about how uh... these people  are poor and black and he goes in the  are so poor uh... he goes that you see  them and just a sea of black faces and  then wolf got on and he was like so  poor so black these motherfuckers are  like charcoal there jack need to get some  white blood into these folks so black so  black there's some whitey running around 
[01:09:00]  in there though you see him every so  often here and there so i'm being carried  away yeah bruises on the hell there's  one on the cover of the daily news  today there's a white guy  uh... daily news photographer captures  the horror outside superdome is a  beaten man is carried away beatings  looting's gunfire rape uh... all the  features down there this guy um man is  he beat up he's unconscious they're  carrying them off then it look like he's  got one of those little ss things on  his arm little uh... what is that that 
[01:09:30]  little ss lightning bolt on his arm  yeah he this might have been a uh... yo  shut the fuck up maybe this guy should  have kept his shirt on yeah maybe not  expose that tat  the south a lot of fun down there  venezuela is helping us out  uh-oh cool look at that man's teeth  there are just some really foul people 
[01:10:00]  this is baton rouge footage  go back to new orleans  baton rouge turn the channel this is one of  the shelters  they're feeding people now  all right anthony uh... this just came in abc news report on rising gas prices  it is out here on the highways of america that for the millions of americans who are not  directly impacted by katrina that is it is perhaps most clear that this has become a national disaster  in places closest to the hurricane zone there are still long lines for gas in mobile alabama customers waited 
[01:10:30]  only to find out the pumps had gone dry  governors in some states are warning gas station owners against price gouging  at this station in louisiana a reporter found an owner lowering prices only when the camera got there  in connecticut one station stopped selling gas because of the high cost of bringing it in  we're just taking a stand against  price gouging  and we won't do it we won't be a party to it  drivers across the country including new york city are fed up with higher prices 
[01:11:00]  they're trying to blame it on a hurricane  that's in new orleans  we're in new york  14 gallons 48 dollars  too quickly too fast too expensive too unexpectedly  how worried should you be about labor day travel  experts say there will be fuel for planes and gas for buses  but if you're driving yourself  care to pay  when you're talking about twenty cents  forty cents  in a period of a week and gas prices may well go over four dollars in some parts of 
[01:11:30]  the country this is going to really hit people in the wallet when they've got the  pump  part of the question is when will the prices come down the experts say that  he did that is the refineries refineries are places  that that take crude oil and turning into gas that we can all use  eight refineries were shut down by katrina at this point charlie only  one of them  has plans to go back into operation and that could take  two weeks back to you  there you have it  latest on the gas prices 
[01:12:00]  this is um...  five club clubs in new york  funny name but you're an ass  because anthony you can criticize the president all you want stop acting like  you're such a free thinker and everyone is sheep  your criticisms don't hold up though if they rely on  visceral populist rhetoric and dull cynicism  that that isn't my argument my argument holds up it's not based on visceral populist rhetoric and dull cynicism it's based on the fact that thousands of people don't have food water now that whole criticism is based on the fact he wanted to say those words and he couldn't figure out how to get them in a sentence 
[01:12:30]  we get it you're smart  smart yeah  uh... we get it you have a thesaurus  what  a thesaurus  i'm criticizing the uh... administration for not acting quickly enough to get these people the essentials  i'm not even talking about getting them all out  i'm not saying why aren't they all in hotel rooms right now getting room service  i'm talking about food and water  for for these people that they know where they are  they know where thousands of them are sitting right now 
[01:13:00]  and they've gone days and days and days without the essentials  why  why is that  uh...  uh... populist rhetoric  and dull cynicism  you ass  and i i can criticize the president all i want  of course i can  he's been dying to say  dull cynicism  visceral populist rhetoric  no one talks like that  you five glove gloves  yeah  you enjoy yates humor  yeah  you know what that uh... post needs  at the end

[01:19:00]  still in the  boxes  just gotta raise  it work  man  you know  let the  swogies  loot  oh  oh man  Jesus  what the hell  is a swogie  i think it's a  derogatory term  for an african  american  all we know  is that our  general manager  in boston  used that term  in front of us  and we've  been using it  ever since  we really don't  know what the  exact definition  of swogie is  but we've gone  with it for many  years now  he was pissed 
[01:19:30]  at us because  he had to  deliver a check  to the swogies  instead of  go play golf  because we  screwed up  and had to  give money  to a charity  and the only  people that  would accept  money from  us as a  charity  were the  black  vietnamese  disabled  black  vietnamese  veterans  we tried  the jimmy  fund  we tried  everything  they did  not want  ovian anthony  money  they didn't  want our  vietnam  in boston  did not  want  they'd rather  have children  dying of cancer  than take our  money  they'd rather  have kids  with hair 
[01:20:00]  falling out  than take our  money  can you believe  that  we learned a  valuable lesson  that day  disabled black  vietnam veterans  took our  money  and brucey  mittman  our gm  had to  present the  big giant  check  to them  so  you know  typical boston  uh  he uh  he marches in  yeah  while we were  doing our  afternoon drive  show  boys  while you  were here  i missed  a day of  golf  because i had  to present  a check  to the  schwuggies  schwuggies  unbelievable  i'm going to  bond with you 
[01:20:30]  i'm going to be  edgy  oh yeah  i'm going to be  on the edge  boys  he was a  midget that  loved his  pot  and he was  running the  whole place  we actually  liked the  guy  we had a  love-hate  relationship  with this  guy  was five  feet tall  and he  drove the  biggest  suburban  and uh  swear to god  watching him  get into that  thing was hysterical  we used to  tell him what  just get the  rope ladder  you'll look  ridiculous enough  how much more  ridiculous will  look if a  rope ladder  rolls out the  side and you  could climb up  it  he needs one  of those  helicopter baskets  to get in  a winch 
[01:21:00]  he was in  a monster  truck  monster truck  so that's  where the  shrugging term  came from  i forgot what  we did that  day that  where we  fucked up  but i don't  know  why would we  have to do  that  it was for  our cd  yeah maybe  that was it  it was for  our cd we  wanted to do  the right thing  and get some  proceeds to a  charity so we  went all around  boston and that  was the only  charity that  would accept  i remember  when we had a  meet with the  gays and he  came walking in  and he goes  boys 
[01:21:30]  the faggots  are here  and we had a  march down the  hall and someone  had to like just  run our show for  about a half hour  and they handed  out dittos  what was the  one ditto  like mark  what was it  it was a big  coming out thing  was the problem  they had  it was  the problem  they had was  how hard it  is for young  gay men  to come out  wasn't that  over that  dumb bit  hi mom i'm gay  yeah  that was all  it was right  yep  it was that  and they  got all angry  and offended  that it's very  difficult for a  gay man to  come out 
[01:22:00]  to his  friends and  family  and you  making light  of this  is horrible  so we had  to sit in  this office  i can't believe  we were at  the point in  our careers  where we  actually did  this and  didn't just  punch the  gm in the  face  but i want  to go back  again  he did walk  down and say  the faggots  are here  yeah  boys the  faggots are  here  and then we  go into the  general manager's  office  he's supposed  to be the  big guy in  charge  and then he's  in there  very serious  and reprimanding  us in front of  the quote  faggots  it had nothing  to do with him  thinking we were  wrong and let's  bring these people  in to sensitize  the guys to this 
[01:22:30]  this was purely  i don't need  these faggots  on my back  we'll have them  come in  blah blah blah  they'll leave  everything's off  sit down  and they reprimand  you  yes that is  exactly what it  was  we sat  they handed  out dittos  that they  have printed  up about  books that  they took  out of the  library  johnny tells  his family  and we're  sitting there  making like  we're reading  it and i  got a rod  and they were  talking about  you know with  the whole voice  and everything  it's very  difficult to  come out and 
[01:23:00]  it's a very  nerve-wracking  thing for  somebody and i'm  sitting there like  i'm gonna start  laughing i'm going  to start laughing  and biting my  lip and uh  that was our  day uh that we  had to sit with  the faggots as  brucey mittman  and brucey was  like boys take  take the dittos  home and the  books  take these home  and do some  homework you know  and soon as the  quote faggots  left  he's like boys  you can just  throw that away  and get back in  there and do a  good show  and then now for  days i remember 
[01:23:30]  he came in and  he was like well  did you read your  literature like he  was all joking  he was the worst  anything we said  on the air he  was ten times  worse behind the  scenes yeah and  then we'd have to  babysit his kids  while we were  trying to do a  radio show bring  his young son and  daughter in and  sit him down i've  got a meeting boys  watch my kids and  bring him in the  studio and we're  trying to talk about  dicks and pussy  you got two like  pre-teens in the  studio  as hot as that

[01:33:00]  of a kind  remember when  Opie smashed  the pinball  machine  it's a classic  Rolling Stones  pinball machine  brought in by  Al Dukes  producer of  another show  Ron and Fez  yeah  that's right  it was Ron and Fez  Jesus  they're starting  up very soon  on this channel  and he brought  it in for Opie  as almost a  peace offering  because you two  would always  have this little  underlying problem  yeah Al wanted  Opie to like him  and Opie just  hated him for no  reason  that was the  underlying problem  that was it  because Al's an  annoying piece of 
[01:33:30]  shit  I've never been a  fan of the  kiss ass  anybody who  needs Opie to  like them  he just hates  yeah  I've never been a  fan of the kiss  ass  and he'd be  brought in  he knew you were  a fan of this  classic pinball  machine  brought in this  Rolling Stones  pinball machine  and Opie  took to it  with I guess  what resembled  Gallagher's  watermelon hammer  and smashed it  right in front  of a very sad  Al Dukes  well one of the  pieces made it  a lot of people  thought it was a  radio bit 
[01:34:00]  ho ho  Opie didn't really  destroy that  pinball machine  and there it is  so we got a piece  of it  wow let's see it  piece of radio  history  wow  that's incredible  like having  Marconi's original  plans for the  radio isn't it  signed  same thing  right  this is like  the script  to War of the Worlds  prices are brutal  we got a fish tank  it's a terrible  price  dude  this is how big  the piece is  it fits in a  CD case  but it's  mixed face  couldn't you find

[01:35:00]  is it going to be  when we have to  send out a press  release that we  raised $2,000  wait a minute  does the piece  come with that  empty CD case  too  yeah  well there's photos  on the front  of the CD case  showing what part  of the machine  it came from  it's almost like  the certificate  of authenticity  and some action  shots of me  actually  I'll give you  $6  a little bidding  worth  wow  I like that  that's the way  to spice it up  a little excitement  alright well  we'll add it  to the pile  these items  wouldn't be good  if you're trying  to raise money 
[01:35:30]  for someone's  flooded basement  in Bayshore  this is some  of the worst  goods I've ever  seen  no one's going  to want these  all kidding aside  we have to start  somewhere  and I think  we're going to  get better prizes  as we go on  here so  we're going to  continue this thing  I think for the  whole month of  September  didn't you break  one of your  shoelaces the  other day  I did  up for bid  it's up for bid  Travis has a pair  of my pants  that he hasn't  worn yet  I did bring in  some old jeans  for the young  go-getters

[01:47:30]  been asking  does anyone  read those  things  that's it  that was  it  no you  can't blow  the siren  beetle  belly  it's great  how do you  drive  there's two  captions in  the  feet  feel  feel  feel  feel  feel  feel  feel  feel  feel  feel  feel  feel  like  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  he would  get on  the news  on the 
[01:48:00]  radio  and read  the  funny  papers  when there  was  I  believe  there  was  a  strike  or  something  yes  and  yeah  this  is  uh  this  beetle  bailiard  one  this  two  little  caps  here  and  this  one  this  beetle  he's  opening  a  box  and  he  new  racket  Sarge  won't  be  able to  And in the next caption, it's a big tennis racket.  And he goes, help me lift it, will ya? 
[01:48:30]  Sarge is never going to get one past that one, but he can't lift it.  Because it's a big racket.  Oh, Beatle.  This is Jimmy's new bit, and I love it.  Well, Fight Tech is pretty funny.  It's got a woman with weird hair and two guys stay on the side of her.  And the one guy goes, don't you find it a little strange, a Chinese restaurant named Unlucky House. 
[01:49:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, come on.  People have to understand what you're saying.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Don't you find it a little strange, a Chinese restaurant named Unlucky House?  And the other guy goes, no.  No, this place is great.  I see what your misfortune cookie says.  It doesn't say that.  It does.  No, this place is great. 
[01:49:30]  See what your misfortune cookie says.  I just said that.  You said, I see.  Oh, okay, but it's still the misfortune cookie.  Of course.  Of course.  Misfortune instead of fortune.  My favorite, though, of all time has always been the Lockhorns.  Oh, they are so funny.  Let's go to the Lockhorns.  That old couple that's been together for years.  Okay.  Jimmy?  You're going to make me try to get through this one?  Yeah.  All right.  In the, in this one, she walks in, and there's a crib, and there's a little, a lump laying 
[01:50:00]  in it, and it looks like red stuff on the side.  And she says, honey, what happened to the baby?  And he says, I fucked you to death.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Kirby and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[01:50:30]  All right.  Lots of action in the studio today.  Bill Burr playing Carolines all this weekend.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  I think I'll be there tonight, Mr. Burr. 
[01:51:00]  Okay.  And I got to thank, by the way.  You'll get to see my hacky, uh, looting bit.  You got a looting bit?  Oh, everybody does at this point.  Very good.  I got to thank the people that responded, by the way, to my website request.  Thank you all for the nice responses.  People that I asked to update, they responded, so thank you.  What's up with the picture you showed us?  I have a urinary tract infection.  Um, I know what happens.  And, uh, it was really burning last night.  It was pissing.  And it felt like a little ball of fire coming all the way up my urinary tract. 
[01:51:30]  Doesn't that happen to chicks?  How do you get that?  Yeah.  I don't know.  You've got a girly disease.  He really does.  I don't know.  But I feel fat.  Were you fucking someone that gave you this?  I don't think so.  Do you have to drink cranberry juice?  I did.  I've been non-stop with the cranberry juice.  But I went and bought this stuff.  I thought it might be gonorrhea, but I'm like, well, I haven't gotten laid, so it couldn't  be gonorrhea.  I just got tested.  So I bought this stuff called Azo.  And they said it's going to make your urine orange.  And it did.  And there's a nice thick string.  Did you see the picture?  Azo? 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  How did you hear about that?  I asked the pharmacist.  When your dick's on fire, you ask questions.  Words to live by.  Yeah, certainly.  It just sounds like a wacky name.  Yeah.  Azo.  When your dick is on fire.  Yeah, that shit hurts, though, huh?  It feels...  Well, I always worry.  Of course, you're panicking.  You think it's VD or something.  But I was talking to actually Marina at the cell last night.  And she said, well, does it feel like you can feel it tracing through the entire urinary  tract?  It feels like, on a much lesser level, almost like there's something with its claws hooked 
[01:52:30]  into that soft tract skin.  And as you're peeing, you can feel it, like, scraping along the sides.  Clawing down?  Yeah.  And you can feel, like, this little ball, this little hot ball of...  That's horrible.  I can trace the whole tract of it.  That's your inner tract of it.  That is horrible.  That's just wonderful.  And I have a bad foot.  Yeah, and you got a bum foot.  He's got a ski boot on today. 
[01:53:00]  A soft ski boot.  What's with the boot?  Like, what does the boot do?  Keeps it from moving.  It does?  Yeah.  Is it immobilized?  Yeah.  Isolated.  I'll mobilize you.  I went to a...  You're a mess, Jimmy.  I have a grade three osteochondral defect.  A whole bunch of shit.  Oh, B, it hurts. 
[01:53:30]  Does anybody...  Do you guys know...  Anthony, you might understand this.  This is what I got.  Sagittal and coronal T1 wave images were obtained.  Okay, this is the MRI results.  What?  This is the MRI.  You'll understand this.  There is a grade three osteochondral defect at the medial aspect of the talardome, which  is kind of like Bill said it might be, but it's closer to the talardome.  And it's measuring in length and width.  The bed of the defect demonstrates subjacent marrow edema. 
[01:54:00]  The defect demonstrates T1 and STIR hypo intensity, indicative of a partial osteo and  croatic fragment.  Stop whining.  Subtalar and midfoot articulations are intact.  Anterior medial and lateral group tendons are preserved.  There is chronic Achilles tendonitis.  There is a sprain of the anterior talafibular ligament.  The collateral ligaments are otherwise unremarkable. 
[01:54:30]  Well, no shit.  The sinus tarsal and tarsal tunnel are patent.  The plantar fascia is intact.  Oh, it is?  Yeah, and that was something we weren't too sure about.  Yeah, I didn't think after hearing all the other stuff, it was going to be intact.  I could have just read the synopsis.  You're right.  Can we interrupt for Live Bush?  Oh, yeah.  Live Bush.  Mike Keating is in charge of NORTHCOM, General Arnold Ray, who's active duty general on the 
[01:55:00]  ground in Louisiana as well, and Mike Brown is the head of FEMA.  There's a lot of aid surging toward those who have been affected, millions of gallons of  water, millions of tons of food, making progress by pulling people out of the Superdome.  There's an issue right now that the Convention Center in New Orleans, the General Arnold  Ray briefed us on.  Pulling people out.  Trying to get food and medicine to the Convention Center. 
[01:55:30]  I got nothing.  Working with the government.  I got nothing.  And the Agent General and the mayor.  He's like Brando.  He won't read it beforehand.  He's just kind of, no.  Of the newly arrived MPs to secure the site so that the food and medicine and water can  get in there.  A lot of people working hard to help those who've been affected, and I want to thank  the people for their efforts. 
[01:56:00]  The results are not acceptable.  I'm heading down there right now.  I'm all so at this atmosphere.  I'm looking forward to talking to the people on the ground.  I want to assure the people of the affected areas and this country that we'll apply the  assets necessary.  to get the situation under control, to get the help of the people who've been affected,  and that we're beginning long-term planning to help those who have been displaced, as well 
[01:56:30]  as long-term planning to help rebuild the communities that have been affected.  He's reading his Iraq speech.  I'm looking forward to my trip down there, and looking forward to thanking those on the  ground, and looking forward to assure people that we're on top of this situation.  And we'll help people who need help.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Wow. 
[01:57:00]  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Well, I do think he's probably an awful people, because even a dumbbell like this has people  who are actually making these decisions, who are in charge of these divisions, which is  not him, and they are just incompetent.  It's more of these people than of this bush.  He's not going to go to New Orleans.  The MPs hit him.  If he wants to impress people, he should be flown into the Superdome.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, that ain't happening.  He should speak there.  He'll either go to the Houston Astrodome or Mississippi.  You're right.  He's not going to Houston. 
[01:57:30]  All right, then it's Mississippi.  No, you can't go to Houston.  Mississippi, then.  It'll look bad if he doesn't go somewhere near New Orleans.  It'll just, people will go, look at this motherfucker.  Can't even show up.  He'll go somewhere real soon.  Maybe the airport, you think?  Somewhere.  He'll just stand there.  I'll find some water and stand in it.  Yeah.  That's a little really bad.  He's going to go to his ranch, pick up some clothes.  Yeah.  Get some boots.  Auction them off.  We're trying to raise money.  Raise money. 
[01:58:00]  Speaking of which, we've got some ideas for more items coming in.  Todd, what's up?  Yeah, you guys disappoint me a little bit this morning.  Nobody's mentioned what could be the holy grail of auction items.  Private viewing of Ben Todd.  Oh, private viewing.  We haven't seen much of old dirigible cock today.  Where is he?  He's working hard behind the scenes.  Doing what?  Thanks, guys.  Punching out.  All right.  Let's say hi to Dave in Indiana.  Dave.  Doing what?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Little Jimmy.  John. 
[01:58:30]  You guys want to take that show on the road?  Watch an auction off a show at somebody's house.  Punching out.  You know, it's an old bit, but it's not a bad idea.  Yeah, that'd be great.  I guarantee you guys would get some good money for that one.  Well, that'd be awful.  Can you imagine, though, if it's some house in the middle of nowhere?  All the money disinfecting it, so Anthony will walk into it and probably can't get the auction money raised.  Like I'm going into someone else's house?  You're going to have to make it look like the house in E.T.  Really?  You're going to wear a beekeeper suit.  You're going to be the DJ in the plastic bubble. 
[01:59:00]  Right.  You've got to sit there at the kitchen table with that sticky grape juice circle.  Oh, of course.  You're supposed to sit on his couch?  We should think about it, though.  It's not a bad idea.  Oh, keep thinking.  Yeah, especially if it only gets, like, 400 bucks.  No, we would have to have a minimum, you know, a minimum.  A minimum of a million dollars!  Right.  Because we're fancy people.  And we need equipment where I could broadcast from the Escalade in his driveway.  As you guys go into that Petri dish.  I say we at least think about it. 
[01:59:30]  I'll auction this off.  However much people think I should pay for Anthony to sleep in my bed for a night.  Oh, my God.  If you're in it.  How has everything become a homo joke on this show?  I don't know.  I don't know.  What it is.  We've just given up.  You're faggots.  You brought the homo to this show and we just...  I didn't bring the homo to the show.  There was no homo on this show before you.  There wasn't much homo before you.  Your signature bit with people saying I'm a faggot on the radio. 
[02:00:00]  What are you talking about?  We would go down that road just quickly and with a little cuteness to it.  But you brought the full homo to this show.  That's not true.  And we gave up and we can't...  Yeah.  We can't hold you back anymore.  You're the one gallivanting backstage with dittos and things of that ilk.  Reading their literature.  Learning.  You brought the homo to this show.  I did not.  But there's a good painting on Rent Boy here where it's...  Yeah.  The book you brought in.  I brought this in.  Rent Boy.  This is really hardcore gay literature. 
[02:00:30]  Not badly written if you have to know.  And I would make the interns read it.  That was a punishment cover.  Good answer, Bill.  The punishment was that they had to read a chapter of Rent Boy.  And it was actually an idea I got from a girl who gave me that book.  It's something we obviously did before you joined the program.  Someone is attracted to that.  Look at that photo.  Wow.  I think we should sign that and auction that Rent Boy book off.  Oh, that's a big item.  I think so.  The Rent Boy book.  It has been used on the show.  It has been.  All right. 
[02:01:00]  Good morning, America.  Foreign countries mixed reactions to the hurricane.  Good morning, Charlie.  As you say, the devastation caused by the hurricane dominates the news.  This is just one of the headlines here in Britain.  Anarchy in New Orleans.  A lot of sympathy being expressed, but also a certain amount of gloating.  Gloating.  Today, German TV described chaos and anarchy in the U.S.,  noting that these are images you'd expect in a third-world country. 
[02:01:30]  Powerful friends like Germany, France, and Japan have offered assistance.  And not-so-powerful friends, including nations the U.S. helped during the tsunami,  have offered what they can.  Pope Benedict prayed for the victims of the flood, and he was not alone.  In Havana, Fidel Castro led a minute of silence,  before gaveling the Cuban parliament to order for a resolution attacking the Bush administration on Iraq. 
[02:02:00]  Castro's close friend, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez,  offered cheap fuel and aid to the disaster area.  Last week, Pat Robertson said the U.S. should assassinate him.  This week, Chavez took a swipe at President Bush.  The king of vacations there at his ranch said nothing more than you need to flee, he said.  Islamic extremists are even nastier.  One website gloats that private Katrina has joined the global jihad, or holy war. 
[02:02:30]  With luck, it said, oil prices will hit $100 a barrel.  Moo-ho-ho-ho-ho.  One of the more interesting reactions comes from the Netherlands,  another flood-prone country where engineering experts say if the U.S. had a system of levies as good as theirs,  lives could have been saved.  Charlie?  Great.  Why don't you send some wood shoes over here?  The rest of the world should be smashing the response to this.  That's funny.  What?  Wood shoes.  It's a wood shoes joke.  No?  No?  Those cute wood shoes. 
[02:03:00]  I know.  All right.  That's right.  There you go.  Ben has just handed something over.  What is it?  I know.  We're looking at front pages of papers from across America.  Frustration boils.  That's Baton Rouge and another desperate S.O.S. coming in from Las Vegas.  S.O.S.  What an embarrassment this is.  The whole world is watching this abysmal response to a tragedy right here in this country. 
[02:03:30]  And loving every second of it.  Of course they are.  You know what, though?  The U.S. sticks our fucking noses in everywhere.  And at times, that's great.  But when shit happens here and you can't take care of it, don't expect the rest of the world  to be sympathetic.  Wow.  There's a fire burning there, huh?  That's a biggie.  Where is that?  I don't know.  New Orleans.  Somewhere in, yeah.  Let's go to Steve in Wisconsin.  Steve.  Yeah, O-N-A, little Jim.  How are you doing?  Hi, fella.  Hey, I was just calling to say I heard Sirius is going to donate four Sirius satellite units 
[02:04:00]  so they can plug up the levee today.  That's very funny.  Very good, buddy.  Ed in Oklahoma.  Ed?  Hey, man.  How are you going this morning?  All right, Ed.  Hey, I was wondering if you guys heard about the Oklahoma City DJ that got fired yesterday  for this kid called and collect from the Oklahoma City County Jail, told him that he molested 
[02:04:30]  a five-year-old girl, and the DJ told him, well, why don't you take a shirt and hang yourself?  The kid did, and they got all over the DJ and fired him.  Are you kidding?  I didn't read that one.  No, it was at 94.7, the buzz.  All right, we'll look into that, definitely.  Why would they fire the guy for saving taxpayers' money?  There seems to be a little more to that story.  We'll try to get some news on that.  Unless they fire him, unless there's some kind of a stupid law that prohibits you from 
[02:05:00]  encouraging someone to commit suicide.  All right, Ed, thank you.  Let's go to Great Neck.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, listen, Jim.  No joke.  Seriously, get yourself to a doctor and get some antibiotics prescribed to you.  Yeah, I am.  Okay, good, because that goes real bad real fast.  Okay.  Yeah, I'm all right, Ben.  I'm going, actually, today.  I have to get some kind of an antibiotic.  But it actually feels a lot better since I just started taking this.  I took this as-o last night, and I feel like 50% better today.  All right, Frank in Tennessee.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I will be willing to donate money to your auction if, for a week, I don't have to listen 
[02:05:30]  to Jimmy's annoying hyper-pronunciation voice.  Please.  Oh, you're not a fan, sir?  I'm not a fan.  Who's the guy from the other day?  How could anyone not like Jimmy?  I don't understand.  So, sir, you're not a fan, but do you still listen to the show?  I listen to the show for mostly Anthony.  I find him to be hilarious.  So how does it feel to know that...  Now, wait.  Stop it, Jimmy.  Let that just sink in.  Jimmy.  He makes a good point.  He certainly did.  But does it bother you that, like, I'm on your favorite radio show and I'm going to continue 
[02:06:00]  to spoil it for you?  Absolutely not, because I know in a little while you'll be leaving to do your stupid show or  whatever you have to do.  Two weeks gone, one week back.  Yeah.  Two weeks gone, one week back.  A stupid HBO show.  A dumb show that's going to pay you millions.  It's silly.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what?  You get millions of dollars, so what?  Yeah.  Jimmy's not going anywhere.  I'm not going anywhere, sir.  So, so, so your pants.  Dude, do you understand?  I don't hurt that you don't like listening to me.  I mean this sincerely.  You're a paying customer and your opinion is of no value to anybody. 
[02:06:30]  Hey, Jimmy, guess what?  I'm a paying customer for XM Satellite Radio.  Exactly.  I listen to all the channels.  Keep paying, stupid.  It's in the morning.  Just keep paying, fella.  All right, Frank.  Just keep paying, Frank.  All right, Jimmy.  Thanks.  All right.  That's right.  I kind of liked Frank.  Frank, I didn't care for him, and yet you did.  I didn't really mind Frank.  Anthony liked Frank.  I'm kind of on the fence with Frank.  And Jimmy hates him.  No, at least he didn't like me, but he didn't even mention Ope.  He just mentioned Ant.  No, but he didn't say I stunk. 
[02:07:00]  He just says he listens to Anthony.  That's right.  Hey, Frank, if you have kids, I hope they're abducted.  What do you think of them apples?  Stupid.  All right.  One more story about what's going on, and then we'll move on to bombs and flubs.  How does that sound, guys?  Very good.  All right.  Good morning, America.  America had this piece on the refugees, and where will they go?  Here at the Astrodome, Houston officials thought they'd be able to put up 25,000 people. 
[02:07:30]  That is clearly not the case.  There are about 12,000 people inside, and we are being told that here at the Astrodome,  they are running out of blankets, food, and room.  He and others waited in frustration when officials at Houston's Astrodome turned away dozens of  arriving buses, saying the makeshift inn was just too full.  Exhausted and desperate, families continued to recount the horrors of their ordeal at the New Orleans Superdome.  People died in that Superdome, and you don't know nothing about it. 
[02:08:00]  In the confusion, some of Katrina's refugees were left on the street, abandoned by their drivers.  Finally, officials agreed to allow them in.  Those that are on site will be processed.  Thousands had already arrived here earlier, famished and in need.  The flood of Katrina's homeless stretches across the country.  On the Internet, some are offering places to stay.  In Baton Rouge's River Theater, where thousands have been camped out since Saturday, the frustration is growing.  I don't know how you're going to work it out being in here like you're in prison. 
[02:08:30]  At the Davis Middle School in San Antonio, many are still concerned about missing family members.  I left my husband in New Orleans.  He worked in the French Quarter at the Amel Orleans, and I just want him to know that we're fine.  City officials are readying a former military base to house 25,000 more.  In Houston, Madeline James and her niece found themselves at this fire station thankful for donated clothes.  We used to see people walking on the street with shopping baskets, homeless and stuff, 
[02:09:00]  but we never dreamed we'd fall in their same shoes.  Upstairs, firefighters have taken in the Taylor family, all 77 of them,  and the requests for food and shelter keep coming.  It turned into 88 people the first night, and then all of a sudden now it's gone to balance.  When we go back, we don't know where we're going to go because we don't have nothing to go to.  The buses continue to pull in here this morning,  and city officials have even moved some people over to the Reliance Center next, 
[02:09:30]  or where they set up a medical unit.  People who come here, the refugees who come here on buses, may not stay.  If they are well enough, they could be sent to other shelters in Dallas or in other states.  That's the latest on that.  Doesn't sound good.  Bush is heading to Mobile, Biloxi, and New Orleans.  He's taking off.  He's on the helicopter? 
[02:10:00]  He's taking off.  Or is he just taking the helicopter to the jet?  To the Air Force One.  Yeah, that's just to get him to the old penny.  All right.  Good luck to you.  Godspeed.  Want to switch gears?  Yes.  All right.  You want to do bombs and flubs?  All right.  Jimmy, are you annoyed?  I want...  That guy Frank?  I swear to God, I want to sink my teeth into his face.  I know you do.  Just bite him.  Yeah, what I hate about people is I just hate their anonymity. 
[02:10:30]  I wish...  I mean, again, I know they're out of state and they can't come in here.  It's just a frustration because I'm used to dealing with people face-to-face as a stand-up.  And if a guy heckles you, you address him and you look at him.  And I hate...  I hate the anonymity.  Yeah.  Like the guy...  What was his name?  The fucking cocksuckers languishing.  Steve from Yellowstone.  Like that guy.  Exactly.  The anonymity there.  That pussy.  I think that's the over-enunciation that drives Frank so crazy.  Right there.  Hey, Frank, I swear to God, I hope your wife loses one of her tits. 
[02:11:00]  I swear to God, I hope that you have to tell her that that half a bra looks good and you  still love her while your friends laugh behind your back.  You might be taking pleasure in the fact that he got under your skin, though, sir.  Oh, I don't care.  I don't play a sight game with people.  He irritated me and I want to bite him.  And you're an anonymous motherfucker and I hate you.  Drunk driving accident for your kids.  That's what I say to you, fucko.  Let's play Bombs and Flubs.  Wow, wow.  I might even kiddin'.  I'm not trying to be funny.  No.  A drunk driving accident and their little bodies dragged out. 
[02:11:30]  One shoe in the back seat.  A little patent leather buckle shoe.  A patent leather shoe with what looks like cranberry sauce on it.  Is that enunciated well enough for you, shitbag?  The little buckle and the little sock with the ruffle at the top.  And a hole in it where that toe would have been if it didn't come off in that fucking door hinge.  What is wrong with you guys? 
[02:12:00]  I'll be at Caroline's this week.  Yes.  Yes.  Wow.  All right.  Bombs and Flubs.  We'll start with bombs.  How does that sound?  Bombs.  Of course.  These are the comments that at least one person in the studio thought were funny.  And the rest somehow just didn't see the humor.  Maybe weren't listening.  But it really, it bombed.  And most listeners hated it, too.  Of course they did.  All right.  So here's the first one.  Who is it?  Who gets the first one? 
[02:12:30]  It's from Anthony.  God damn it.  I have a lot of bombs.  I throw a lot of shit out on a daily basis.  Let me tell you something.  Not all going to stick.  Let me tell you something, Anthony.  Yeah.  Your only bomb.  No way.  In Bombs and Flubs Volume 3.  Come on.  I got plenty.  This is your only bomb represented here.  Here's Ant.  What's the deal?  They bandaged it up.  He just had to wait a while.  He took some x-rays.  And he's going to call in like a couple minutes.  He's just going into Duane Reade, I guess, to get a prescription filled. 
[02:13:00]  It took him a while because his hog donated blood for all the victims of the London bombing.  Nothing?  His hog donated blood for all the victims of the London bombing?  Well, it was a little wordy.  It was a little wordy.  All right.  Shut that down.  All right.  We added a tone.  Yeah, we added a tone so you know we're back alive.  I like how quickly you realized you were bombing.  I knew it as I was saying it.  As it was coming out of me, I was like, this is going nowhere. 
[02:13:30]  And the reason in my head?  Too wordy.  I absolutely knew why that bomb.  His hog donated blood to the victims of the London.  To the victims of the London bombing and blah, blah.  Shut up.  You're just running to the end of the sentence.  Oh, I just want to get it out of there and cover it up.  That was the day Ben didn't show up for work because he got hit by a cab, by the way.  It was one of the days?  One of the many days he didn't show up for work.  He's been much better lately, though.  All right.  Speaking of Ben, he's the next one that bombs. 
[02:14:00]  Check out Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  There's one for the flubs.  All right.  There's Nathaniel writing it down.  Here's Ben bombing.  All right, Mike.  Well, come back with your head lowered in shame.  I will.  I will.  I'm on my way.  Good job.  Look at the bright side.  Slink back, Mike.  Look at the bright side.  You got the guy that made his terrible wow flyers going around Times Square.  That guy from yesterday.  The crazy guy that was in here.  This terrible fire.  Hello. 
[02:14:30]  No one was listening to Ben at all.  No one was listening to him at all.  I just like how he kept going and going, waiting for a reaction from somebody.  You got to admit, that guy was pretty funny in some way.  All right.  We're back live.  Did you hear fucking SpongeBob Skull trying to cover it up and just keep talking?  Like, you know what, though?  I mean, the guy really was his flyer.  Yeah, he was crazy, yeah.  Bomb.  A little fucking trick of, like, when it bombs, you know, you turn it into a serious statement 
[02:15:00]  quickly.  I never meant it to be a joke.  But, I mean, I heard he really worked hard on them, you know.  Never meant it to be a joke.  All right.  The next one is from Jimmy Norton.  Uh-oh.  He says, how the hell did you find one of these?  Oh, look.  Yeah.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  It's got your past.  Aw.  But what?  You made us all look.  I'm sorry.  Did I ruin it?  No.  What?  Jimmy?  There was just something that said Bitter Ant.  That was the name of the product.  And I was just thinking that thing.  Me when I'm all bitter?  Yeah, but it just doesn't hold on. 
[02:15:30]  That one bombed in theory.  You bombed well in advance in your head before it ever came out.  Yeah, I can't believe that was going down.  You knew.  I just love hearing, like, as you lose confidence, as it starts to bomb.  Oh, yeah.  You start off, like, really decent volume.  Yeah, that's kind of like the guy, you know.  You just become this fucking little four-year-old.  I want some ice cream.  All right, the next one is from Rich Voss, bombing on the Opie and Anthony program. 
[02:16:00]  I want to be on the cover of Tiger Beat with, like, a white bathing trunks with the lining torn out.  Nice and wet.  I'm about to cover Nambla Weekly.  I think that was necessary.  That was a good line.  I didn't hit the button.  Don't look at me.  Is there a Nambla Weekly?  Nambla, Nambla, Nambla, Nambla, Nambla, Nambla Weekly. 
[02:16:30]  No, it was just an awful attempt.  Yeah.  I watched it.  That was, like, a really inside thing, and he knew what Nambla was.  Fucking dope.  Educated.  All right, the next bomb is from...  Oh, Jimmy Norton again.  Oh, no.  She said that if Andrew gave him the pictures he took because you smashed her camera,  she would give him a blowjob in exchange.  You want a blowjob today, Andrew?  She offered.  No.  She would definitely do it for you.  Yeah, she certainly would.  Oh, no.  Man, she said, even if you don't give me the pictures, I'll give you a blowjob. 
[02:17:00]  Those nice ratty teeth wrapped around it.  You should have sucked in front, too.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  All right, let's get Sandy Kane in here.  I didn't even know where the bomb was there.  Yeah, I don't get that one.  It was...  Even if she doesn't give you a blowjob, you don't bring the pictures, she'll give you  a blowjob.  Yeah.  This is some mild, weak, attempted humor.  All right, that wasn't that bad.  No.  That's right, then.  You piece of shit. 
[02:17:30]  This one is titled Ben.  So Ben's bombing here.  Then it says Voss impression.  Does Ben do a Voss impression?  Wow.  Ben doing impressions.  And then it says, comma, Jim Flub.  Let's take a listen.  That one made page six.  It did.  One of Ben's parties actually got into page six in the paper.  About the celebrities that were there and Voss.  Voss.  Hey, it's Voss.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm out of here.  Why?  I was like, I don't know what a good birthday bomb. 
[02:18:00]  Car crash.  No, no, no.  You're in a category all by yourself, man.  That's not even a car crash.  This is a cake falling off the floor and thudding.  Falling off the floor?  Yes, because the house was turned upside down in a tsunami.  Falling off the floor.  A cake fell off the floor.  Candle right through her head.  A bomb and a flub, all in one. 
[02:18:30]  That's stupid Ben doing that Voss impression.  Hey, it's Voss.  Hey, hey, little boy.  That was his Mark Perrino impression.  Terrible.  Hey, it's Voss.  And that's when you know you're doing an awful impression, you have to say the person you're  doing it.  Hey, I'm Bill Clinton.  He starts with, hey.  Hey.  This is the guy I'm impersonating.  He claps his little fat hands.  Hey.  Hey, boy.  Hey.  Just laugh.  A one little fat-headed addict alone with his merriment. 
[02:19:00]  The next bomb is from myself here.  All right.  I'm prepared to bomb.  I'm not here to play this game.  No, no.  Don't.  Don't prepare.  So I was going to go, Jimmy's not on the South Beach diet.  He's on the South Bronx diet.  Hookers and losing weight.  But you can see where it could have been cute. 
[02:19:30]  That one actually brought shame into the room.  Yeah.  That was so bad.  People are commenting that this is the worst tone that was used ever.  It's awful.  It's one of those raise your right hand if you hear it in your right ear.  Yeah.  Kind of tones like you heard in school during the hearing test.  Where did you get that? 
[02:20:00]  That is horrid.  Van Horrid.  It's on.  No, it's not.  There you go.  Got headphones on.  And now it's back.  I just, it's just something it generated by the editing software.  Like an old 50s tone.  It's like one of those books you read as a kid.  Yeah.  You know?  It's time to turn the page.  Well, people don't like it.  Sorry.  All right.  We'll find a new tone for the next.  I like this one.  It's annoying everyone.  Keep it.  All right.  The next bomb is from Rich Voss again. 
[02:20:30]  I'm 37, Rich.  37.  Wow.  Same as your waist size.  Uh, nothing.  They told me to call to be mean.  Well, that was mean-spirited because...  I can't be mean because it's your birthday.  You need to be a birthday ball.  I don't even like doing the...  Hmm.  All right.  That's just pretty much Rich being on the show, isn't it?  He's so experienced with bombing, too.  He just plows right through.  Plows ahead.  I like when he goes, but, ah, like he's changing the subject and it goes nowhere. 
[02:21:00]  Watch the laugh track in his head.  It ends right there.  He just hears smiles and laughs.  He hears smiles.  Oh, yeah.  The next bomb is from old Jimmy Norton.  Oh, ooh.  We got to talk about the Jesus statue that opened its eye.  Ooh.  A little creepy.  It's not a big mystery, though, by the way.  No?  Somebody was being loud in the house.  It stinks, but I don't like it. 
[02:21:30]  I just meant that there was no mystery because the joke would have been that it's obvious  he opened his eye because somebody was loud and he was like, what?  Right.  Oh, good Lord.  Hello, exactly.  Oh, exactly.  That's a good one right there.  Wow.  What an abrupt stop.  There was six seconds of dead air after that line. 
[02:22:00]  And then he just goes, ah.  And then he started feeling uncomfortable.  That was like a cabin pressure thing.  Catastrophic loss of cabin pressure.  No lamps, frost on the windows.  Uh-oh.  Wow, that's good.  All right, the next bomb is from Nathaniel.  Sitting to my left today.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Olive.  Olive who?  I love petting puppies until they die. 
[02:22:30]  That's all right.  No?  All right.  Nope, you might want to pet yourself there.  All right.  You should pet that joke.  You got it.  Well, someone's laughing.  Three clowns in that room.  I mean, never take a chance, Travis.  Enjoy anonymity, stupid.  Oh, he smashed you.  He may have bombed, but he's calling you a pussy boy, and I think he's right.  Never take a chance, Travis.  Wow.  Can I point out that I like the fact that the guy who creates the bit and does all the editing 
[02:23:00]  puts in his own bomb slash segue into a kill.  Exactly.  Absolutely.  Sorry.  He was able to rehash the whole Travis thing.  Anytime I could make fun of Travis again, I would take advantage of it.  He fought back well there.  Who?  He did.  After he bombed.  Yeah, he did.  All Opie pants.  That fucking awful shirt he has on is really...  That is a pedophile shirt.  Physically ill. 
[02:23:30]  I think Henry Lee Lucas wore that when he came to us.  A little checkered shirt.  Nice.  All right.  The final bomb.  And this next one is, just for a little background, we're listening to the audio from Saturn.  Remember that weird audio?  Oh, yeah.  That's the weird sound you'll hear.  The radio telescopes picked up these weird sounds from Saturn.  That's the background sound you'll hear.  Okay.  Here's Jimmy bombing.  And they're not explaining this further yet?  No, that's pretty much it. 
[02:24:00]  It's just radio waves from Saturn.  You're hearing them.  There they are.  Some form of intelligent life?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  If you listen close, you're going to hear cathedral.  Cathedral.  So that's an ongoing story.  That's your science lesson for the day.  From popular science.  People want that audio.  Where the fuck can I get that audio?  That's creepy as hell.  Any Nine Inch Nails album.  Yeah. 
[02:24:30]  Wow.  All right.  Let's go to Greg in California.  Just go to FARC.com.  That's where we found it.  We should give FARC a good plug.  Yeah, that came off of FARC.  Those two jokes, let's acknowledge this.  My last two jokes bombed so bad, no one made eye contact with them.  That bad.  It was almost like you had all walked in on me.  You ever see Prince of Tides when Nick Nolte's a boy being fucked in the ass,  and his brother looks in the window and sees it and then shoots the perpetrators?  That's how the feeling I just got.  Like you all just peek through the curtain and saw me being raped by an old gentleman. 
[02:25:00]  That bad.  I was listening, too.  There you have it.  That was a fucking good double bomb.  That was.  Then he came back strong, though.  Of course.  Those were awful.  All right.  People saying that tone is the same beep they used to advance the frames during one of those  slide shows you used to get in school back in ye olden days.  Wow. 
[02:25:30]  All right.  We'll do flubs before we get out of here for the week.  We got a couple of phoners today, too.  What?  A couple of phoners.  Really?  Let me look.  Where?  Where's my sheet?  Guests.  Guests?  I don't even look at that section of the prep sheet anymore.  I have no idea who that is, and I have no idea who that is.  Kelly Hansen, new singer of Foreigner.  Come on.  Didn't we hear a little of a...  Why are we talking to him?  A new Foreigner. 
[02:26:00]  Didn't we hear it and said it was really good for Foreigner, but...  Yes, Jim?  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  This is what he does now.  Yeah.  Yeah, he didn't bring the homo to the show.  As he pulls down his pants and farts into the microphone.  Didn't need to see that.  No.  No.  Yeah, now he's just pulling his pants down.  You're right, Jimmy. 
[02:26:30]  You're right.  It's not gay, though.  It's a bunch of men sitting around being men.  Now he just pulls his pants down and farts into the mic without that pesky material.  His hairless Asian ass.  Yeah.  That's how he takes leaks in the bathroom now.  Oh.  Like he walks up to the urinal and will pull his pants down to his knees and stop peeing  like he's a six-year-old at Shea Stadium.  And it's not just us that go, you know, go to that bathroom.  It's other people on the floor.  So there's strangers in there.  Mm-hmm.  Let them look. 
[02:27:00]  It's an eyeful.  All right.  I don't know what this is about.  Jason in Florida.  Jason.  What's up, guys?  Happy birthday, little Jim.  Me.  Thank you, Jason.  Okay.  Assaulting media went terribly wrong yesterday.  Horribly wrong.  I was doing, of course, Rick and Bubba, which we all know, which is hardcore down here.  We were going to do them, the local TV station, plus the radio station.  Rick and Bubba's security tackles us dead center before we were going on the air. 
[02:27:30]  You got blocked from going on the air to do an assault on the media.  Oh, it was, I mean, I'm talking knee-deep, right in the legs.  And they popped us hard, their security.  He's basically saying nothing happened.  I know.  Yeah.  And what?  Well, spent the night in jail and have just been released about eight minutes ago and heading home. 
[02:28:00]  Why were you in jail?  For what?  They said we were trespassing on private property.  Were you?  No.  It was, they were doing a relief, and Rick and Bubba had set this up with the TV station and the local radio station.  And they had been talking about it since Monday, and we figured, why not?  Who's Rick and Bubba?  I know.  I don't know.  Rick and Bubba, they're big down here in the south.  I'm sure they're hilarious.  They must be huge. 
[02:28:30]  They, oh, their security, no kidding, it was three of us.  We had our three signs, T-shirts, and they tackled us dead center.  How many security guys they have?  Eighteen.  Do they?  Yeah, I'm sure they did.  All right, thank you, Jason.  Congratulations.  You got the name Rick and Bubba on our show today.  No, no, no.  Hey, big fan down here, guys.  All right.  Rick and Bubba.  No one has 18 security people, sir.  That's got to be a hoot.  No, listen, Rick and Bubba, they're big down here. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, they're Rick and Bubba.  Thanks, Jason.  I bet you Cooter does the weather.  That's probably a funny show.  Yeah.  Speaking of the assault on the media.  Rick and Bubba, tune them in.  Give them a listen.  The assault on the media contest for August is over, Anthony.  And the winner is Stephen, the Lion Man in Alabama.  Right.  His video will be up on opanthony.com, the winning video for the month of August.  Steve wins a My5 portable satellite radio from MyRadioStore.com. 
[02:29:30]  He also wins dinner with E-Rock at Paisano of Mulberry Street in part of Little Italy.  What a prize.  He also won a trip to the studio to watch the show through the glass.  Through the glass.  Not in the studio.  He also won a pair of tickets to see Bon Jovi live at the opening night of the new Nokia Theater in Times Square.  And finally, Stephen, the Lion Man in Alabama, the winner of the assault on the media contest for August, 
[02:30:00]  has won 30 days free video game rental from GameFly.com.  Congratulations to Stephen, the Lion Man in Alabama.  Congratulations.  The winner of the assault on the media contest for August.  And we're starting this contest right up for September, right?  Mm-hmm.  And we'll have more fine prizes to give away to the winner at the end of this month.  A lot of press will be at the beaches over the weekend.  They all go to the beach because it's the last big weekend of the summer. 
[02:30:30]  Labor Day weekend.  So try to win.  You never know.  We have no one in the lead for the month of September.  No one.  It's wide open as we head into the weekend.  So there you have it.  Details on the assault on the media contest are up on opandanthony.com, foundrymusic.com.  And that's about that.  Okay?  Right.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break.  Speaking of GameFly.com, yeah, we should talk about GameFly.com for a minute here.  I also want to say Bill Burr in studio.  Very funny guy playing Carolines all this weekend. 
[02:31:00]  Go out and see him if you're in the area.  I'm going.  I think we're going Saturday.  Oh, all right.  Going Saturday.  Thank God.  So do good show Saturday.  The other one.  Do good.  Do good on that day.  You do good show.  Last time I saw you, you killed.  It was Charlie Murphy and Donnell.  Donnell.  Mm-hmm.  Donnell, really funny as well.  Charlie Murphy, whatever.  No offense to you, Bill, because I know you guys are friends.  You killed.  You were so much better than him, and he was the headliner that night.  Yeah, but, I mean, he's only been doing it for six months or whatever. 
[02:31:30]  I know your friends.  You don't have to defend him.  It's just my observation.  You killed.  We'll put it this way.  If Charlie wasn't there, I would have been performing in front of eight people.  Really?  I don't know how it goes.  That's so weird.  Yeah, there's something about that fame thing.  It's crazy.  People just seem to show up to see it.  You're getting a name for yourself, too, though, Mr. Burr.  Yeah, hopefully.  Anyway, Gamefly.com.  Oh, that's my cue.  Well, that doesn't have to be.  You like games, do you?  You like them?  You buy games, and then you get them home and go, ah, this stinks, and I just spent like 
[02:32:00]  40 bucks, and now you're screwed.  What do you do?  You go to Gamefly.com.  And can I ask you something?  Sure.  One of the latest games, Tomb Raider, a game I used to play.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Well, everyone's laughing.  That's so old school.  I know, but they got a new one that came out.  Did it come out, and no one cares, or what's the deal?  Do you know anything about it?  No, I've never been into Tomb Raider, but I hear they were kind of revamping it.  They were ready to release it, and then they bailed on it, and I know that. 
[02:32:30]  I guess no one really cares about the Tomb Raider series anymore.  I saw it in our little video game store the other day.  You did?  It was on display, so I was just wondering if there's any buzz on this game at all.  No buzz at all.  Okay.  No buzz.  But if you wanted to check it out.  What?  What?  Go, go.  I'm just laughing at you.  You keep trying to defend Tomb Raider, and he's just swatting it down.  It stinks.  Isn't it kind of good?  No.  No.  Awful.  The game has always sucked.  But weren't a couple people talking about it?  No, they weren't. 
[02:33:00]  Not a one.  I enjoyed the game for a little while there.  I haven't played a version of the game in, I don't know, five or six years.  What was the last game you played?  I've been playing Space Invaders.  Yeah, my gaming is a lot different than Anthony's.  I'm doing Hot Shot.  Hot Shot Golf?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  F-O-R-E.  I do the Tiger Woods.  Yeah, I did Tiger Woods as well.  I love all the golf games.  I'm still playing Medal of Honor.  That's a good one.  I like that game.  Yeah, good series.  It's not a bad game at all. 
[02:33:30]  Siphon Filter?  Anybody?  I love Siphon Filter.  I loved Siphon Filter.  My brother is addicted to all the Siphon Filters.  I played the, I think it was the first or second version.  I played the second one.  But they're up to like five or six now, right?  They kept going with that series.  Yeah, it was a good game, good story.  I like when there's a lot of shit to do in a game.  Good soundtrack.  Login!  Login!  Yeah.  Bring back memories?  Yeah.  That's why I didn't like the Tomb Raider games.  Tomb Raider was a jumping puzzle game.  That's pretty much it.  It's like a 3D Mario Brothers. 
[02:34:00]  You're just jumping up and down.  It was one of those games.  It was a nightmare to save it, too.  Yeah.  So you would do all the, you would have to figure out like how to jump perfectly to get  from one ledge to another.  It was really tricky.  And if you missed that jump, you had to start all the way back, way too far back.  Nothing better than having to go over a point in a game 500 times to get past it.  Because they don't have a save feature.  Right.  And you get to the last thing you've got to do, and you fall, and it brings you back to  that.  And you would get to that same part where you just can't do it, and the panic would set  in, because you know all the time you invested to get right back to that ledge again with 
[02:34:30]  the snake on the other side, and you've got to get to that ledge just perfectly or the  snake is going to, you know, get you.  Yeah.  Over and over and over again.  Just games should be made where you've got a save feature any time you want it.  Did I ever tell you the story I had to replace my PlayStation because of Tomb Raider?  Because of that exact scene I'm describing?  You threw it?  You had to jump, I think it was backwards, what you had to do with the control was ridiculous.  Backward flip onto this ledge, but you had to time it perfectly because they had this 
[02:35:00]  huge snake on the ledge.  And if you missed, you fell until, I guess I forget now, like a well or something, and  that was it.  You had to start way back in the game.  I finally picked up my PlayStation and just slammed it on the ground and destroyed it.  Of course you did.  And I loved my PlayStation so much that I had to go out and get another one.  And then, stupid me, what do you think?  I'm right back at the game.  Yeah.  They're addicting.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  Game fly.  That way you're not buying games and realizing they suck, and then they just sit there.

You could do that if you want.  I'm sorry, man.  I'm just looking for a loophole there.  You found it.  Boy, you're a tricky one.  Now they, no, okay, forget it.  Gamefly's done.  Thanks.  Thanks.  You've just undermined their entire plan that they had.  We got three sponsors, and one's going away thanks to you. 
[02:36:30]  Two games at a time.  I mean, hey, no shipping charges either way, either.  Hmm.  You keep the games as long as you want.  No late fee.  Uh-oh.  All the games you want.  Can't you just?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  If there's no late fee, Bill, yes.  I guess, technically, you could just keep the game.  Yeah.  What do they do in that case?  Do they bang on your door eventually with the National Guard?  They do a private blockbuster design.  After a certain amount of time, if you don't bring it back, they consider it bought.  That's right. 
[02:37:00]  Gamefly.com slash XM.  We had a little something on that, and you had to stop the bid in its tracks there.  No, you asked a question so I answered it.  We're going to have a little...  You with your information.  Yeah, we're going to have a little more fun, and then maybe give the info eventually.  I didn't think you knew.  Yeah, we knew, but we were going to have fun.  Well, don't blame me, because you're a good actor.  How was I supposed to know?  You look scared and confused.  Gamefly.com.  You know, I just figured it out.  You know what?  We had a whole scenario where people were struggling to keep the game, and they were pulling to try  to take it out of their hands.  Go ahead, do it.  I felt momentum. 
[02:37:30]  It was building.  Right?  You felt the right build?  Yeah.  I sent something.  I just didn't know what it was.  You're going to come in with the actual info, and now we all sit around going...  That's not true, though, because what happens is they actually can't do that now legally,  they said.  Sorry, I'm back to you.  Gamefly.com slash XM, and then you plug the XM into the promo code box, and you get a special  offer.  Shh, it's secret.  Gamefly.com.  All right, on the way, we've got Kelly Hansen, new singer of Foreigner. 
[02:38:00]  We have Jeff Norris coming by to say hi.  Oh, big white gorilla.  We've got some baseball talk on the way.  We have an update on the Subway Masturbator.  Oh, the guy that was on the front page of the papers.  Yes, we have an update on that, and we also have flubs from Bombs and Flubs, Anthony.  Yeah.  And we're going to attempt the Sex Offender game.  Oh, get that one on the Gamefly.  Sex Offender game?  No? 
[02:38:30]  It's kind of fun to...  It is fun.  We've been playing this in the office.  This website is very interesting.  I noticed Danny's very good at it.  Danny's very good at the Sex Offender game.  I only have one Sex Offender close to where I live.  Really?  I feel like I'm lucky.  Only one, four blocks away.  Oh, I thought it was your exact address.  Huh?  I thought it was your exact address.  No?  Nothing?  The only thing...  The only thing worse than when a joke bombs and you think, that gem, they just didn't hear it. 
[02:39:00]  Let me blurt it out again and again.  I got kind of a creepy guy that lives right next to me, and in my head, you know, because  of his website, I'm like, I would bet anything he's got something.  But it turns out the closest Sex Offender to me is four blocks away.  But some of these guys around here were putting in their addresses, and you should see how  many freaking red dots pop up.  You pop in your address, and it gives you a little MapQuest-type map of your neighborhood  with little red pins.  And that's just people who get caught. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, right.  They get about, like...  They've had to register as a sex offender in your neighborhood, and they're all over  the place.  I don't know who it was.  Someone threw their address up, and it looked like...  The screen looked like it had measles.  There were so many...  Just a bunch of dots?  So many red dots.  Yeah, I looked in my neighborhood, Great Neck.  Got a few of them around there.  And the game is, you know, popping on there.  You look at the guy's picture and see his name, and then you try to figure out what sex  offense he was jailed for.  Want to play, Bill?  Oh, shit, yeah. 
[02:40:00]  Of course.  All right, we'll do that next.  What is this?  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane. 
[02:40:30]  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not dying.  I'm a diva.  I'm on Starbucks coffee.  I'm everywhere.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  But at least they're not funding terrorism. 
[02:41:00]  Alright, you're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show.  Mmm, blueberries.  I'm getting one too.  What are you getting?  I'm one of the common people going to fetch me some blueberries.  You're just getting raw blueberries like that?  Absolutely.  It's a superfood.  Superfood, bro.  A lot of antioxidants, son.  Salmon.  Salmon?  Salmon.  I said that on purpose.  I really did that time. 
[02:41:30]  Okay.  I know it's salmon.  Avocado is very good for you, right?  What about, what nut is good?  Avocat.  What's that?  What nut?  Um, I don't know.  No, it's one nut.  Believe you?  I don't know it.  Um, nut.  Pecans?  Pecans?  Is it pecans?  Pecans?  Pecans?  Pecans.  Or is it cashew?  Pecans.  The cashew.  And, uh, and spinach is good.  All the shit food, right?  Avocado is tasty.  All the stuff that isn't sweet and creamy.  And tomato sauce.  And delicious. 
[02:42:00]  You know what I like?  You know what is the best tasting thing on the face of the earth?  Yankee Doodles.  Drake's Yankee Doodles.  They're like devil dogs, but not as dry.  Oh, they're great.  When they're fresh, oh, they're fantastic.  And they are no super food.  This one has a problem.  That's what I'm worried about.  Maybe I should have washed these.  You didn't wash them?  No.  Do you know what happens in the fields when they pick those?  Do you know what happens?  I'm trying to build up my immune system.  Mexicans are picking those.  They're huge fields. 
[02:42:30]  Oh.  Would you like a mouthful of orange piss?  That's got to help.  And they don't walk to the toilet across a big field.  They shit.  Nothing.  That line made Jimmy sit down.  I was just horrified.  I didn't want to laugh at that.  No, no.  I had to sit because my foot's really sore.  Oh.  Too bad.  You little booty.  What's the boot supposed to do for your foot?  Make it not sore.  No, it's supposed to straighten.  That's what I'm reading.  Straighten it out?  Hey, we got a guy in Mexico calling in.  Were you done?  Yeah, goddamn Mexicans. 
[02:43:00]  What they do is they shit in the field, right, on your blueberries and strawberries and every  other berry.  That's because the man won't give them a break.  Right.  You know, they should be close to toilets in there, but they can't drop these portable  toilets in the middle of your harvest.  The portable toilets?  Hey, where's our...  We got to get an update on the auction.  Is it up and running, this auction?  Yes, what are our goods being sold for?  What is the Mexican one?  This shithead has been working on this auction for a month now, and we have three items for  bid.  Nothing.  I want him fired. 
[02:43:30]  A month?  We didn't even know about the disaster.  Nah, we said something.  Oh.  We kind of did, actually.  We were setting this up for something.  Sure.  You're right about that, Jimmy.  Ralph in Mexico.  What's up?  Ralph.  Ralph.  Ralph.  Hello.  Hello, Mexico.  What's up, man?  What you doing?  This is such a fake Mexican.  What kind of Mexican is named Ralph?  What's up?  What you doing?  Yes, continue.  Just go ahead with the bid, and we'll cut it off at our leisure. 
[02:44:00]  I guess he'll cut it off.  Oh, Ralph.  He really thought he was going to get us with, what you guys doing?  With his scarface fucking accent for a Mexican.  Danielle, Long Island.  Asshole.  Hi.  Precious.  Hi.  How are you?  We're all good.  Okay.  I just moved into Mastic Beach about a year and a half ago.  Dude.  Yeah, no.  You're in Mastic?  Mastic Beach.  Yeah.  It's a little different than Mastic.  Mastic Beach is a little bit nicer.  No, it's not. 
[02:44:30]  No, no, no.  Mastic stinks.  There's a lot of Section 8 housing there.  Yeah.  You know what Mastic Beach is?  It's full of black people that call themselves Indians.  And people that didn't do well on their MAPs.  They're black people, but they say they're an Indian tribe, so they get the tax things  and the cigarettes and all the...  There's a reservation right around the block from me, and it's all run by black people.  Yeah, it's all black, and they're like, no, man, I'm a motherfucking Indian, motherfucker.  You're like, no, you're a black guy, right?  I know about Long Island. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  Long Island full of Indians.  You understand Mastic Beach.  Yes.  And the Section 8 housing, obviously, we have a lot of, at least three times a week, you  get one of those notices in the mail about all the sex offenders moving into the neighborhood.  A new sex offender coming out?  We get, at least three times a week, we get a notice.  You have a new sex offender moving into the neighborhood.  The levels of offense, their name, their birthday, and depending on the offense, you get their 
[02:45:30]  address.  Wow.  I can't even imagine what the map looks like around my house.  They must be literally worse than measles at once.  Well, I have to look.  Yeah.  You should check it out.  Mastic Beach.  What do you do that you have to live there?  What do I do?  Yeah.  Well, I'm only 28, and it's the only way to live out on Long Island by yourself.  Were you a stripper?  No, I'm a veterinary technician, actually.  Oh. 
[02:46:00]  All right.  If I was a stripper, I could live in freaking Great Neck with you.  What do you think?  Yeah, that's true.  I'd be making a lot more money than what I'm making now.  But to live on Long Island, you can't afford anything now.  Yeah, but Mastic.  Yeah.  I paid $160 for my house.  That's the only place that's affordable less.  That's not about a hotbed of sex offenders who really keep the prices down.  Yeah.  No kidding.  On the house.  I think the real estate bubble has popped in Mastic Beach. 
[02:46:30]  What's funny, though, is that my house probably doubled in the past two years.  You heard they call it Mastic Beach, right?  Yeah, well.  Yeah.  I don't like to tell people I'm going to do that.  It's got to be worth at least $40,000 now.  All right.  Yeah.  Thank you, Danielle.  We get it.  You're getting mail.  Thank you.  All right.  Hey, Eric, back in studio.  He's working on the Opie and Anthony auction for the Hurricane Relief Fund that we have started.  Oh.  Where are we at?  We're doing pretty good.  Steve will have the link up very soon.  The link?  Didn't we say that an hour ago? 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, but it's taking a while.  Can we look and see if any of these items are being bid on?  Yeah.  Are they?  Not yet, no.  Can we see before 11?  Yes.  Well, the link.  What do you have to do for the link?  Because all you have to do is put a thing with pictures.  Yeah, like an icon.  Yeah, he'll have it on.  You'll paste an icon.  Can't you go to eBay right now?  If you want to.  And look?  Yeah.  Have we said that it's on eBay?  No.  Not at all.  Not at all.  Oh, we didn't?  No, because it's eBay and a non-profit organization called Mission Fish that is handling all this 
[02:47:30]  So if you go to eBay, how do you find our auction?  You can search for Opie and Anthony Auction.  Uh-huh.  What about the other items up there that our fans just sell on a daily basis?  Don't buy those.  Those won't get you.  Yeah, but how do you know the difference?  The money won't go to the charity.  How do you know the difference between the two?  You just need some official thing, right?  Auction.  This has an official Opie and Anthony thing on it.  So go Opie and Anthony Auction on eBay.  So what items do you have?  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  Thank you.  It's great. 
[02:48:00]  Good stuff.  Thanks.  You guys want to play the Sex Offender game?  I was hoping we'd get a riveting whole break out of that.  What happened?  Travis?  Me and Danny were just looking for them on eBay, and it's going to be kind of hard for  people to find them.  Oh, no.  That's always good.  Because Eric didn't put a space between Opie and Anthony.  So if you put in Opie-Anthony, none of the auction items will show up.  But if you type in Opie-Anthony as one word, then they'll show up.  What if you put in, like a normal human being would type Opie and Anthony? 
[02:48:30]  No, not going to show up.  It won't come up if you type.  Where's Eric?  We can do a search right now on eBay.  Where is he?  Steve, you got anything on this?  Hold on.  Why would you not?  Get baby hat in here.  You're typing in something to search.  Wouldn't you type it in as Opie space and space Anthony?  I don't know what they're searching on, but as far as the actual name itself, yeah, it's  one word.  Opie and Anthony auction is the member name. 
[02:49:00]  Sorry.  So I guess we'll help people along a little bit when we get the link on Opie and Anthony  dot com.  Right?  Okay, I'm here now.  Yeah, don't worry.  There's going to be links to everything.  Eric's just adding these things in.  And the way you can tell is we've set it up so that there's going to be a little yellow  ribbon next to the icon that designates that everything's being donated to charity.  So you'll be able to tell.  A yellow ribbon. 
[02:49:30]  Yes.  Oh, for fuck's sake.  Yeah.  Dick.  Nice close-up shot of Steve's junk.  Yeah.  Jimmy just took a photo of it.  No, no.  I won't.  It's so weird.  We were doing that bit before Jimmy came in and joined our show.  So I guess Jimmy's right.  He didn't bring the gay into the show.  Taking pictures of other guys' cocks.  I remember a whole montage we had back in the old days and at AF.  Made a collage and put it on the wall.  God, I was mistaken.  All right. 
[02:50:00]  Let's play the sex offender game.  I don't know how we're going to play this, actually, but we're going to try.  Oh, my God.  Oh, this is the number.  Okay.  I see.  Oh.  What?  Oh, I see what's going on.  Do I get one?  Yeah, you get one.  Oh.  Thank you.  Oh, you nailed him.  I'm the only one with the answers.  Oh, really?  I'm the only one with the answers.  That's not fair.  That's not fair.  One of the guys should have the answers.  No, I'm going to be like the guy.  I'm going to set it up. 
[02:50:30]  You should guess, too.  Yeah, why don't you guess?  I'm going to set it up.  I don't know this shit.  All right.  All right.  Anthony, you could explain the sex offender game.  Yes.  And then I'll do the setup here.  Travis found a website.  Wasn't it Travis?  Travis found a website.  He was taking quite a risk going online to get a virus and found a website where you put  in your zip code or your address or whatever, and it pops up a map with a bunch of little  virtual pins on it that locate sex offenders in your neighborhood. 
[02:51:00]  In a really bizarre way, it's a fun thing to do.  Isn't it?  It's kind of fun.  Kind of click and find out what kind of creeps are living around you.  And along with the information about where they live is what they did and what type of  person they did it with, age, sex, and what they did to that person.  A sex offender can be anything from flashing somebody all the way to molesting.  Right.  Child molestation.  It runs the gamut.  Everything.  If you were that guy that they took a picture of in the subway showing your cock to the girls, 
[02:51:30]  you'll eventually end up on the sex offender list.  It all depends on how you do it.  So we got some of these guys in front of us.  Yeah.  We're not going to give out their real personal info, right?  Just don't have a first name.  I'm not even going to do that.  Why?  Hugh?  You're the first name.  Nah.  We got the description.  That's good enough.  This guy is Hugh.  I'm saying his first name.  Yeah.  I think that contributes.  You sure?  We'll be all right with that?  You could probably give out his full name, but I wouldn't do that. 
[02:52:00]  How about the top four sexual predator first names?  Hugh.  See if there's a link or anything?  All right.  Here we go.  The first guy in the sex offender game.  I can't believe I didn't get a car crash on that.  He is Hugh.  His name is Hugh.  He is white, six feet tall, 270 pounds.  Black hair, brown eyes.  He was born in 1950.  Right.  How old does that make him?  55.  55 years old. 
[02:52:30]  And he's on the list.  Where is he from?  What town?  Oh, he's from Brooklyn.  Hugh from Brooklyn.  White.  Six foot, 270 pounds.  This guy, I would say, 15-year-old girl.  Sodomy.  Could it be wishful thinking?  Yes, it could.  I say big fat guy like that. 
[02:53:00]  I say he manhandled a youngster.  Sex?  Boy or girl?  Sex and age of the victim.  I guess that's what we're going for, and the actual crime.  I say the victim was approximately eight years old, and I say that it was a custom minor.  Boy or girl?  Oh, little girl. 
[02:53:30]  Eight-year-old girl, you're saying?  Yeah, he did something to her that you probably shouldn't.  Are we doing Price is Right rules?  If you go over, you're out?  Well, the closest.  I say 15 now.  I say closest.  I say closest, not Price is Right.  It's hard to say, because it's so tempting either way.  You definitely got to get whether it was a male or female.  Yeah.  And if you do get, let's say it was a male, then closest to the age, that person will get  the credit on the right guess.  Okay?  Billy?  I'm going with, I'll also say a minor, I'll say four-year-old boy. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, Jesus.  And I'm also going to say he was related.  Oh.  Maybe like an uncle.  Okay.  Wow.  Put some jam on his cock.  Made it a little game or something.  All right.  Hugh.  It's called kiss the jam or get hit.  Hugh from Brooklyn.  Yeah.  The six-foot, 270-pound white guy.  What do we got?  The victim was a male.  Ah, I'm out.  That's so.  All right.  He looks like Gacy, so I should be good at that.  You guys said boys.  Wait, you said boy, right?  Yeah.  No, I said girl.  Oh, you did?  I thought Jimmy said boy. 
[02:54:30]  No, I said girl.  Oh, Billy gets it by default.  All right.  Well, what's the difference?  I'm going to tell you.  Male, 15 years old.  I think Anthony had the age.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it's got to be the, we said it's got to be sex.  Yeah, you think the sex?  Sex is more important than the age.  It's like a straight, what piece of flush?  I think the age is more important than the sex.  They're all sex offenders.  It's harder to get the age than the sex.  Sex is 50-50.  A 16-year-old boy is a lot, nothing compared to a 9-year-old girl.  I mean, the age is more important than the sex. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  Sex is 50-50 shot.  Age is pretty difficult to hit on the head.  Sure.  I nailed it.  But I like when we think these games out before we go on the air with them.  We think out what the criteria for victory is.  Yeah, you should have a point system.  We should actually have, oh, a point system.  All right.  Points just hit.  If you get the age.  That's got to be worth more than the sex, like you said, 50-50.  No, you've got to hit an age right on the head, I think, and anything else is zero, or  we're going to be adding up points here, and it's going to get very confusing.  I got the species. 
[02:55:30]  That should be worth 70.  I think age should be, if you hit it on the head, should be five points.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, because you hit the age on the first one?  Yes.  No, because sex should be one point.  Three for the race and one for the sex.  How's that?  How about sex is one point?  I might not tell you the race.  Sex is one point.  All right.  Age?  Age.  Three points.  You want three?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Three points for age.  And then?  One point for sex.  Right.  I was hoping you'd get a bonus and a little bell would go off. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  It's got to be more points for the action, too.  And then, did they say what type of sex crime it was?  Oh, yeah.  I said sodomy.  Yeah, but how much, if you get the crime right?  If you get the crime correct, that's got to be...  More.  Kevin's got his head up with two, but yeah, it's got to be more.  Five, yeah.  Five?  That's a guess.  All right.  Wow, this is very complicated now.  Okay.  Yep.  See, we've all of a sudden made it complicated.  All right.  All right.  What was the sex?  All right.  The sex was... 
[02:56:30]  Well, so it was a male, 15 years old, so...  Anthony and Billy split points, and it gets five.  Billy gets two.  No, I get three.  All right.  Billy gets one.  Billy gets one for guessing the sex.  This is bullshit.  This sucks.  And I get underwear full of clear stuff.  Anthony gets three points for guessing the age.  Yes.  15-year-old victim.  And the crime was sodomy in the third degree.  I got sodomy!  You got sodomy!  You get like a bingo. 
[02:57:00]  I get sodomy!  Very good.  Anthony, way out in front.  Wow.  Sodomy!  Here's the beautiful thing.  You guys both did well, and I'm actually disappointed that he didn't rape an eight-year-old for the points.  So sick.  All right.  There's something seriously wrong with this.  All right.  Right now, Anthony's in the lead.  He has eight points.  Jimmy has zero.  Billy...  That's what we need.  Bill Burr has one.  We need some of that music.  Like...  So when I read the contestant here, you got like game show music. 
[02:57:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Well, maybe if we actually did stuff after the show was over, we'd have this all set up nice.  I do.  Run.  Run for my life.  It's a good idea.  Who came up with this game?  I know it is.  I don't know.  Danny?  Danny.  Danny did.  He admitted, though, we're just going to try and see what happens.  Our next contestant here is Alex.  He is a black...  Oh, a black male. 
[02:58:00]  Also Hispanic.  He is 5'11", 205 pounds.  Keeps himself in good shape.  58 years old.  58 years young.  He also resides in Brooklyn.  And he has a white beard.  Yes, he has a gray beard on his black face.  All right.  I will say that our friend, Alex...  Anthony, our returning champions. 
[02:58:30]  Yes.  I will say a 13-year-old girl intercourse.  Intercourse, 13-year-old girl.  All right.  I'm going to say, what is rape and sodomy?  And I say he did it to a 34-year-old woman.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  All right, Bill?  I'm going to say he exposed himself in the park repeatedly.  To any... 
[02:59:00]  To any...  I don't know.  I don't know.  He's in Brooklyn.  Yeah.  I'm going to go...  I'm going to go...  Actually, white girls.  I'm going to go with white girls in the park.  All right.  Exposing himself.  What's the age?  Oh, I would say like NYU kind of students.  18 to 22.  18.  Stayed away from the graduate students.  All right.  You guys ready?  That's white NYU students.  If they're Hispanic, they're 40 to 45. 
[02:59:30]  This is what this fine gentleman did.  All right.  He had three victims.  Three victims?  Now, how does this work?  I have no idea.  We're going to have to get points for all of them?  We didn't know that, though.  We thought it was like a one-victim thing.  We didn't know that.  Yeah.  So maybe I should do that?  All right.  For the next one, I'll do that.  Oh, for the next one.  All right.  All right.  We're trying to figure this out as we go.  Three victims, all male.  Oh, I'm out.  Me too.  We're all out with that. 
[03:00:00]  I might be able to pick up some points on the age.  So no one got the sex right?  No one got the sex right.  We all thought it was a chick.  All right.  The ages 13, 17, and 23.  Jesus Christ.  I said 13.  I hit it right on the goddamn head.  Billy's giving himself a fucking spread.  Oh, college-age girls.  Great.  Well, you know what?  He loses, though.  He said 18 and 22.  There was a 13, a 17, and a 23. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, man.  You just screwed up.  I should almost get, like, minus one.  You screwed up.  I get three points for the 13-year-old.  All right.  Three for Anthony.  What did Jimmy say?  I said that he raped and sodomized a 34-year-old woman, because we're all assuming kids.  The crime was sodomy.  Sodomy.  I said intercourse.  How old were the kids?  I'm sorry.  How old were the people?  13, 17, 23.  When in doubt, go with sodomy.  Sodomy.  So Jimmy got sodomy, right?  So that's five.  You said sodomy?  I said rape and sodomy. 
[03:01:00]  All right.  That's good enough.  Five points for Jimmy.  Ooh.  Five points for Jimmy.  Five points?  Wait.  On each one?  That's 15 points.  No.  No.  No.  I don't like the idea that there's three.  I say we should stick with the first one on the list.  No.  I'll tell you what the victim...  You never know who's more deserving.  From now on, I'll tell you how many victims there were, and it could be a...  Guess accordingly?  A potpourri of points.  What?  All right.  All right.  All right.  Our next victim, Anthony.  That would be Maurice.  Our next offender, I should say. 
[03:01:30]  Yes.  Maurice.  Ethnicity.  Not Hispanic.  Yes.  He's black.  He's black.  He wrote and sang purple rain.  A non-Hispanic black.  He's five foot, eight inches tall, 152 pounds.  I got this one.  And he also is from...  I guess they just got guys from Brooklyn.  This guy, again, from Brooklyn.  Wow.  Looking at Maurice, I will have to say a man. 
[03:02:00]  Well, he's 41 years old, too.  Did we say that?  Male, then.  Male.  All right.  I will say...  15-year-old male in the study with a wrench.  No?  I get my games confused all the time.  Jimmy?  15-year-old male, sodomy. 
[03:02:30]  Rape the 12-year-old.  Rape, 12-year-old...  Girl.  Girl.  Girl.  All right.  Yeah.  Billy?  Bill?  You know what?  I don't think this guy has the height or the weight to take down an adult.  Oh.  So I'm going to go...  I was going to say 13.  I'm not trying to do that price is right thing where I bet a dollar over a year around.  I hate those scumbags.  Sure.  To get the refrigerator.  Did he rape a 12-year-old?  Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo. 
[03:03:00]  I'm going with 13-year-old girl.  I'm going to go with the popular sodomy.  Okay.  And I'm going to say back porch.  All right.  Back porch.  Oh, wait a minute.  How many victims?  I'm sorry.  It was one.  One.  Good.  It's multiple, I'll tell you, I guess.  Okay.  Probably tell us before we guess that.  I know.  You're right.  But, okay.  All right.  It was a male.  God damn it.  They're all fags.  I'm in.  I'm in.  God damn it, Dan.  What are you jumping off to the site?  Three points to me. 
[03:03:30]  Three points to Anthony.  Bill, you said male, right?  I said...  No, I said...  Oh, you said female.  Yeah.  Girl, 13.  It was male, 12 years old.  Oh, Jimmy said 12.  God damn it.  Jimmy got three.  That's a big point item.  Jimmy got three.  Jimmy's got two correct answers and he's got more points.  No, he doesn't.  Oh, I got a fiver in there.  I guess the offense.  Yeah.  It was sexual abuse, first degree.  What's that?  Don't know.  What he did was he probably jerked off and rubbed the lad's abs.  Yeah, it could have been a little thing. 
[03:04:00]  All right.  No one gets points for the offense.  Oh, he tugged his mule.  He got three to six for it.  No one gets points for the offense, though.  All right.  Oh, look at this creep.  Hold on.  Yeah, the next one's a real creep.  Anthony's in the lead with 14 points.  Jimmy has eight.  And Bill Burr, who's playing Carolines all this weekend, has one point.  That's right.  Bring your youngster down and Bill will act out these things on it.  On it.  That's only in a late show, Saturday.  All right.  We have a 55-year-old gentleman from Brooklyn.  Yes, we're introducing Annabal. 
[03:04:30]  What?  A-N-I-B-A-L?  Annabal?  Mm-hmm.  It's Annabal.  He was born in 1950.  He's, of course, a male.  5'8", 140 pounds.  He is a white, Hispanic male.  And he, too, from Brooklyn.  Judging by the look of this creep, it has to be a young boy.  By the way, there's one victim.  One victim.  I would say that one victim is a 13-year-old boy. 
[03:05:00]  The crime.  Again, the favorite.  Sodomy.  Okay.  I say he raped and sodomized a 23-year-old woman.  Oh.  Wow.  Okay.  Bill?  Bill?  You know what?  This is one of these guys.  He took down a 65-year-old old woman.  One of those oldie rapers.  Just started off as like a home invasion to get a TV.  And that was it.  Yeah.  Just grabbed a hair dryer.  And what was the...  Two to the head.  What was the crime? 
[03:05:30]  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  He did it all.  Sodomy.  Everything.  Next thing you know, her teeth are punched out.  There's a white nursing shoe askew.  It's medicine all over the floor.  Everyone, nitroglycerin in his fucking underwear.  My pills.  Everyone guess the offense?  Yep.  Okay.  It was a female.  Damn it.  Jimmy?  I got a female.  I said...  Both of you guys had female, right?  I said 23 years old.  All right.  So Jimmy gets three and Bill Burr gets three. 
[03:06:00]  That's one point for sex.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  All right.  You're right.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Jesus.  Calm down.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Holy game.  Jesus.  Anthony.  It's very important.  It's a game.  All right.  There's a female.  15 years old.  All right.  Damn it.  No one got that, right?  No.  Yeah.  I underestimated him.  He got six to nine years for attempted rape.  First degree.  No sodomy.  We all don't get points for that.  Darn.  All right.  I got raped, though.  That wasn't... 
[03:06:30]  You got raped, right?  I say rape and sodomy.  It was attempted.  Oh, attempted?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they can do it.  It's just...  The next guy looks like...  Weird Al.  I was going to go with the werewolf in London guy.  Younger with longer hair.  Good thing you didn't.  It would have bombed.  All right.  Our next victim is Luis.  Luis.  He is 34 years old. 
[03:07:00]  A little younger than the rest of them.  34-year-old male.  His race is other.  Ethnicity.  Hispanic.  5'9".  210 pounds.  Residing in Brooklyn, New York.  He has one victim.  One victim.  I'm going to say a 17-year-old female rape. 
[03:07:30]  You're way off.  Yeah?  Way off.  I know what he did.  He spit into his hand and gave a manual release to a 6-year-old boy.  Jesus, Jimmy.  That's what he did.  He didn't blow him because that would be queer.  He spit in his hand and the mother knew something was wrong because she kept hearing the giggles of the lad.  The confused giggles.  Yeah.  The giggles slash fight tears. 
[03:08:00]  They asked the boy what happened.  He said, I don't know.  I just went to sleep and ate cotton candy.  All right.  This guy looks like he got picked on in high school.  Never got laid.  I'm saying he was making up for lost time.  He revisited his high school years and raped a 15-year-old.  Female.  Female.  All right.  Okay.  That's rape.  Very good.  His sentence was one day to four years.  All right.  Wait a minute.  How about this?  Oh, give us the sentence.  Sentences first.  All right.  We'll do it for the next one.  We'll go on.  All right.  We'll figure it out as we go along here. 
[03:08:30]  One day to four years?  All right.  Exposed himself.  The victim was a female?  Shit.  All right.  I got a point.  I got that.  I got that.  I got a point.  And Bill gets a point, right?  I thought the spit in the hand angle was very accurate.  11 years old.  Ah, damn it.  Sexual abuse first degree.  A little diddle.  A little flash?  A little diddling, maybe.  Yeah.  Maybe he just cupped her bosoms.  Who knows?  One day.  In the store, maybe.  Maybe you're in the store and you peeked in the changing room.  You couldn't do that much if you had a day. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  A day?  He fucked a kid.  Well, that may be two days.  Jesus.  All right.  We'll give the sentence for the next victim.  Yeah.  Or the next offender, I should say.  Gerald?  Gerald.  Old Gerald.  Gerald was born in 1944.  He is a black, non-Hispanic male.  Five foot six.  160 pounds.  And he wears corrective lenses.  And he is from New York City. 
[03:09:30]  And I guess he would be 61 years old.  61.  61.  61.  His crime was back in 1996, by the way, if that'll help, too.  How much time did he get, Pumpkin?  Well, ooh, wow.  Two victims.  48 months to eight years.  48 months to eight years.  That would be 48.  48.  Wait, let's start with Bill.  Bill Burth. 
[03:10:00]  I'm going blank on this guy.  I already know it.  Wait a minute.  You know what?  Can I pass?  I'll go first.  I don't care.  What's better?  That club's unexploded again.  That's great.  The only thing that would make me happy is if you were opening a cock and that happened.  Again.  Spilled all over your wrist.  Bill, are you going to pass?  I thought it could come back around to me. 
[03:10:30]  All right.  Jimmy?  I say he has had a sexual battery on two girls aged 10 and 12.  Wow.  Okay.  Wow.  What are the odds he gets that right?  Probably 50-50.  Anthony?  Okay.  I will say, wow, two boys, yeah, I'll say boys on this guy, boys, I'm not with that,  13 and 14, just basic molestation. 
[03:11:00]  He programmed for XM and showed them videos.  He touched them inappropriately.  All right.  Some type of molestation.  I'm going to say, he's a dirty old man.  I'm going to say he's a 13-year-old girl.  There's two victims.  I was getting to the other one.  All right.  She's 14.  I don't know.  He molested, oh, you know what?  A boy and a girl.  Wow.  A little brother and sister were sitting in the back of a station wagon, left unattended. 
[03:11:30]  He was coming out of Circuit City.  And spur of the moment, so he didn't get the premeditated, which is why he got 48 months  to eight years.  All right.  A lot of people writing in on the instant feedback saying, I'm never going to Brooklyn again.  What are you saying?  That he just, let's say spur of the moment, like he was walking by a car and he saw that  they were in the back seat and he had to just put his mule through the window.  Maybe they just tickled it a little bit and he left when the police arrived.  Yeah, it's almost like a popsicle.  So, the victims were twins. 
[03:12:00]  Wow.  Ten years old.  Wait a minute.  Boys.  Boy and a girl?  Ah, shit.  So, let's start with boys.  I get a point each, then.  That's right.  I said two boys.  Jimmy said two boys?  No, girls.  You said girls.  All right.  I said a boy and a girl.  But I said their ages were 10 and 12, so I get half the points.  Yeah, you get a point for one kid being 10.  Who gets twins?  You get all three for that.  What?  He gets all three for guessing the age of one of them.  Of one of them, right.  So, he gets three points, Jimmy. 
[03:12:30]  Three points.  Anyone else get the age?  No.  I only got one.  I said 13 or 14.  It was sodomy, first degree, sexual abuse, first degree.  Anything on that?  I said molestation.  Not sexual abuse, no.  Damn it.  Good Lord.  All right.  I stink.  This is creepy.  It really is.  Want to do just one more?  One more.  The next guy is Keith Robinson.  Let's look through them first.  Let me see. 
[03:13:00]  I don't know.  I might want to go with Warren.  Oh, yeah.  Let's get the...  Holy shit.  I think we want to go with Warren.  What did Warren do?  All right.  We will go with Warren.  Or maybe the last guy, Owen, with the Elo haircut.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  I like Warren.  He's got that you finally caught me look on his face.  Yeah.  Warren is really bad.  Warren is 70 years old.  Can we please do Elo hair, too?  Yeah?  Yeah.  We have to.  All right.  Let's do Warren.  He did a location check on his cock, and it was in a nine-year-old's hand. 
[03:13:30]  All right.  Let's start with Warren.  He's 5'5", 70 years old.  Yes.  He's from Long Island.  He's white.  Central Islip.  Wow.  I used to live there.  Central Islip.  White.  I remember why.  Not Hispanic, 5'5", 116 pounds, gray hair, blue eyes.  Corrective lenses.  Yes.  Of course.  He is an old codger.  He is really old.  One victim.  One victim.  Won the silver star in World War II. 
[03:14:00]  Oof.  I have to say.  What's the sentence?  One year.  One year.  In local jail.  All right.  Okay.  I know what it is then.  It's a girl.  Let's say.  I want to say 11.  11-year-old girl, and he did something inappropriate. 
[03:14:30]  No real touching, but he maybe exposed himself.  What is that called?  Hot.  Hot.  Is there some type of crime there?  It's not molesting.  It's exposing.  It's a sexual battery of some sort.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Sexual horror.  Being that he's 5'5", and 116, I'm going to say, and he's 70.  I'm going to say.  Hold on. 
[03:15:00]  All right.  The conviction was in 2000.  I'm going to say he brutally raped a 35-year-old black male.  Boy, you're really going out on a limb.  No, I'm going to say he, I kind of got to go with Ant here.  I'm going to say he exposed himself to an 11-year-old girl.  Okay.  Is that the same stuff Anthony said?  Jesus.  Trying to steal my thunder.  Just trying to stay out in front.  Thunder. 
[03:15:30]  Thunder.  All right.  I'm going to say this guy grew up a confused gay man.  Came of age in the 50s.  It's unacceptable.  Mm-hmm.  None of these talk shows to make him feel okay.  He finally gave into it.  In 2000?  Really?  Yeah.  He fought it for years, and he just said, what am I going to go my whole life without  pulling out in front of an 8-year-old boy?  I'm fucking doing it.  That's what he did.  I got this guy.  8-year-old boy.  He pulled it out.  He turned 65 and said, ah, what the hell.  Yeah, gray pubes pushing out of those Dickies pants. 
[03:16:00]  All right.  The victim.  We're ready, right?  Yeah.  The victim was a female.  All right.  I get a point.  Me too.  Nice.  Point.  Jimmy gets a point.  Bill, no points.  No points, Bill.  I guess I'm just not good at this.  15 years old.  Thou.  I knew I should have gone.  Nobody, right?  And it was rape second degree.  Wow.  How do you get a year for that?  Oh, you know what?  Maybe that's statutory or something.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe it was a prostitute or something.  How do you let a 115-pound 70-year-old? 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  Maybe it was a technicality.  Maybe he fucked an underage.  They call it rape.  Could have been retarded.  Good point.  The final one?  Yeah.  We'll mention the site in a second here, guys.  Don't worry about it.  Where's the Elo guy?  Everyone wants the site name.  His name is Owen.  Oh, that haircut is awful.  Oh.  There he is.  I know what he did, though.  This is it, right?  What a creep.  Yeah.  All right.  He raped his barber.  Owen is...  Owen is 30 years old. 
[03:17:00]  Uh, Jim, you're really the Paul Lindum, this whole...  Wow.  He's got a crazy line in the name.  But seriously, he raped an eight-year-old.  I'm going to have to say I agree.  The center square.  He raped his barber.  Oh.  Why don't you go down on your elevator shoes?  I remember that line.  All right.  Owen, 30 years old from Uniondale.  You have a scarf tied around your neck. 
[03:17:30]  Bad blazer.  This guy's got a...  Charles Nelson Reilly.  Oh.  This guy has a Caesars haircut.  He's black.  He's 5'6".  Light-skinned black.  Possibly with a little Latino in him, as I look at the picture.  5'6", 174 pounds.  Black eyes.  Uh, black eyes.  Black hair and brown eyes.  Good hair, bad haircut.  Wow.  Uh, one victim. 
[03:18:00]  How much time did he do?  Probation sentence, 10 years.  Probation?  Oh, 10 years probation.  That's right.  But he didn't see any time.  10 years probation.  Then I've got to go up.  What I've learned from this is if they don't serve any time, the age has got to be 15 or  higher, but lower than consenting age.  I'll say 15-year-old girl, rape. 
[03:18:30]  I got this one.  Probably statutory, but it's going to be classified as rape of a 15-year-old girl.  I'm going to say the inappropriate touching of a one-year-old.  You are so fucked up, man.  Inappropriate touching of a one-year-old.  He pulled off her diapers when they didn't need it.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Bring me repressed memories. 
[03:19:00]  I think this...  Well, did you...  Girl.  Girl.  A goyle.  I'd say a 16-year-old girl he had inappropriate contact with or exposed himself.  Okay.  How old?  16.  16.  Exposed himself.  Okay.  Show the unclipped cock.  All right.  I think this guy used the teaching of a musical instrument to lure a...  Like a teaching of, like, the maracas.  To gain the trust.  Yeah. 
[03:19:30]  Of the mother.  And she dropped off her eight-year-old son.  And let's just say when she came back, there was only one maraca.  Only one maraca.  The boy learned maracas with his face in a pillow.  Sir, I can't hear the music.  Oh, my God.  What is wrong?  Jesus Christ.  A bop, bop, a bop, a bop, a bop, a bop, a bop. 
[03:20:00]  Little feet kicking, trying to keep time with the beat.  Holy crap.  Jim, we found your niche.  Ripping on sex offenders.  He's kind of sitting, like, up on his folded legs on the way home.  Mom, I don't like the maracas.  I want to learn the drums.  The maracas make me hurt in the seat of my pants. 
[03:20:30]  All right, listen.  The victim.  The victim.  Was a female.  Yeah, I get a point.  Yeah.  I get a point.  Do I have any fucking points?  Bill, you got four points.  God.  Which means you're the most normal, by the way.  As he cackles over a fucking maraca shoved in some eight-year-old's ass.  Jim, you get the sex of this?  You said female, right? 
[03:21:00]  I said a...  You said a female 16, right?  Yes.  Okay, so you get a point.  And then Bill?  No.  No, I...  And Jimmy nailed this one.  What?  16 years old.  Wow.  Nailed the age as well.  Damn it.  And the crime was third-degree rape.  I do believe I said rape.  Yeah.  So I get the crime.  Crime's five points.  Write a five down.  You had a five...  Write it down.  Did he say it? 
[03:21:30]  I did.  I said it's probably statutory.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're right.  Okay.  All right, that's that.  All right.  Tabulate.  We all need showers after this game, but...  Wonderful.  You know, Jim, it's the detail.  Sitting on folded...  What did you say?  Legs?  Bill?  Propped up on his little knees.  Bill Burr?  Keeping the violated area elevated.  That's just so bad.  Bill Burr playing Carolines all this weekend. 
[03:22:00]  Yes.  Got four points in the sex offender game.  Congratulations to you, Bill.  Yeah.  Bill is the true winner.  Wow.  You know what?  It's really close between Jimmy and Ed.  Let me do some adding here.  I should have said this fatty here smothered an eight-year-old with his ass.  There are some real creeps on that website.  Jimmy got 17 points.  17 for Jimmy.  And Anthony?  Anthony won with 22. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, I guess.  Oh, you haven't figured it out already?  No, I'm just guessing.  Come on.  Tabulate.  Congratulations to Professor Anthony.  He has won the sex offender game with 24 points.  Here's that.  Yes.  Nice.  I am the best.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  And we should give out this website because you're going to have fun with this one.  You're going to find out if there's sex offenders in your town. 
[03:23:00]  You'll have fun with this one with the gang at the office.  Play the game at home.  Play our home game.  Yes.  What's the website?  Oh, thank you.  It's mapsexoffenders.com.

You will never find a female on this list.  Probably not.  It would be nice, though.  You're listening to the soothing sounds of Opie and Anthony.  So sit back.  Relax.  Have yourself some herbal tea.  Close your eyes.  And drift away with O&A.

And it wears a little hat and a green shirt.  We're trying to do something good for once.  And I thought that would get a nice check.  I can't find all these.  I'm sorry.  That's right.  All right.  Well, some of the items are already being bid on. 
[03:27:00]  The Opie and Anthony Dick Cavett Show Rock Icons DVD autographed by Mr. Cavett is up to $55.  Let's see.  Opie and Anthony WWE Chris Jericho figure autographed $26 so far.  And this stuff just went up.  Opie and Anthony WWE poker set autographed.  They might think that's the poker chips.  No, no.  It states that.  You see the photos and everything. 
[03:27:30]  It's not the ones that we use.  Wow.  Why $270 so far for that item?  I think it's because it's a unique item.  You really can't find it anywhere unless the company gives it to you.  All right.  And Opie and Anthony WWE Raw Smackdown magazine that we signed, I guess?  No.  It's signed by some of the wrestlers.  Oh, okay.  That's $26.  Opie and Anthony George Foreman Grill.  Was this autographed?  Yes.  All three of them are, yeah.  All right.  So it's an autographed George Foreman Grill.  That's up to $31 so far.  All right.  We've got to work out the bugs.  But at least it's up and running, and we'll figure it out. 
[03:28:00]  Okay?  All right.  You've got 10 days to bid on the items.  And then we're going to add more stuff as we go along, and hopefully better stuff.  And hopefully, you know, we'll come through with some real money for the relief effort.  Okay?  Some cake.  All right.  We've got to say hi to Kelly Hanson.  The links will be up on opianathlete.com and foundyourmusic.com.  Kelly, what's going on?  Hey, what are you doing?  How are you, buddy?  I'm brushing my teeth.  Oh.  You're brushing your teeth.  Why?  Yeah.  Well, you know, sometimes stuff gets on here. 
[03:28:30]  Where are you calling from?  I'm in Atlantic City.  Oh, okay.  You are the new lead singer of Foreigner.  Yes, I am.  That's really...  Now, that is probably a hard thing to do.  I would think very hard to replace the singer.  Singer.  Well, you know, I try to look at it this way.  Listen, I do the best I can do.  I put my own thing on it, and I'm not trying to be anybody else.  Because that would be way too difficult to do, to try to be somebody else. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, you're singing all the old favorites?  Absolutely.  Yeah, and you've got to have a pretty good range for that, right?  Yeah, it's challenging stuff.  Yeah, absolutely.  Actually, we've got some samples of you singing for Foreigner.  And I've got to be honest with you, you sound great.  Thank you.  But here's the problem, sir.  There's a problem open?  Well, I...  Wait a minute, let's solve the problem.  And maybe you can, you know, help me through this and explain. 
[03:29:30]  When I go see some of the bands that I grew up with,  and they don't have the original lead singer,  I kind of have a problem with that.  Right.  So, explain why we should go see the new Foreigner with Kelly Hanson.  Well...  I mean, you sound just like Lou Graham.  I'll give it to you.  First of all, I'm really sorry you've got problems.  Well, I have more than that.  Yeah, that's your biggest problem.  I have many, many problems.  If that's your biggest problem, that's not too bad.  But there's a bunch of bands, like you've got Journey without Steve Perry. 
[03:30:00]  It's a little strange to me, that's all.  Well, you know what?  Stuff happens in life, and things change.  And the important thing is if you like the Foreigner and you like the music,  then you have to go to the show, and you have to go with an open mind,  and you have to give it a chance.  Exactly, Opie.  No, I'm not trying to be a jerk.  Yes, you are.  Hold on.  Kelly, I'm not...  You're being a little closed-minded.  Honestly, God, I'm not trying to be a jerk.  But this is, you know, something that people think about when they see, you know, 
[03:30:30]  Foreigner with Kelly Hanson and not Lou Graham.  So, I'm giving you a chance to explain.  That's all.  I'm not trying to trash it.  And I totally understand.  I totally...  You know, I'm a Foreigner fan, too.  So, I'm probably more of a Foreigner fan than you are,  because I've been a singer for 25 years.  So, I've listened to this stuff and analyzed it and enjoyed it more than you have.  Okay?  So, it's as important to me...  How do you know?  I had a Lou Graham poster on my wall growing up. 
[03:31:00]  Oof.  No, I didn't.  Oh, yeah?  No, I didn't.  Let me...  Let's go into that.  You know...  Was it hanging over your bed?  Right next to my Farrah Fawcett poster.  Hey, Kelly, I...  And you're cleaning it?  They were having sex at night, and I watched...  Anything?  No.  Do you feel...  Try to bail yourself out.  I know.  Do you feel like...  I mean, I know it's got to be a tough gig, because a friend of mine is a really huge Foreigner  fan.  And it's got to be a very tough gig, because you know you're filling...  Like, you're a qualified singer, obviously, and a really good singer, and you're filling  the shoes of somebody.  Does it feel like, ever, like, all right, well, I have to kind of replace something, and 
[03:31:30]  yet not, like, really try to overdo it without anything different?  Oh, very good question.  Well, that was a very convoluted question, all right?  But I'll try to answer this as I can.  Well, I...  When people ask me about...  And this is commentary here all the time, okay?  There's a commentary about filling Lou's shoes, and my answer to that is that I'm bringing  my own shoes, and I'm not trying to sell anybody else's shoes. 
[03:32:00]  That's just not the right attitude.  But what I do try to do is, and I think that probably hasn't been heard for a while, is  we're doing the songs like you remember them, like the record.  That's what people want to hear.  And to me, that's important, because I want to do justice to these tunes, because these  songs are important to me, and I want to do them as people remember hearing them on the  record.  How many times do you go to a concert, and they don't do the songs like you remember it? 
[03:32:30]  I can't stand that.  And you're like, what are you doing, you know?  So my big thing is, I love these tunes the way they are, and I want to sing them the way  they are, so that's what we're doing, and that, to me, is I think that's partially the  reason why we've had such phenomenal response and acceptance, and I have to really tell you  that the fans have been unbelievable to me.  They've been so gracious to me and accepting of me, and hopefully it's because I'm doing 
[03:33:00]  a good job, and they really like what they're hearing, and so I'm really thankful for that.  Uh-huh.  Where did Jimmy go?  So you're getting a good reaction out there, huh?  Absolutely.  That's great.  Phenomenal.  We got a lot of people.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  We got a lot of callers that are very excited.  They want to go and see you guys, I guess.  All right.  Let's say hi to Steve in Yellowstone.  Steve in Yellowstone.  Hey, Steve.  Steve. 
[03:33:30]  What the hell?  He's very excited.  Steve, go ahead.  Steve, go ahead.  Steve.  Hello?  I'm, uh...  I didn't think I was going to get through. 
[03:34:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm a little bit nervous.  All right, go ahead, Steve.  Just loosen your pants a little bit.  Yeah, calm down, Steve, from Yellowstone.  I'm sorry.  I just feel kind of...  I'm a little bit embarrassed.  I've actually...  My people in my office are kind of laughing at me because I'm calling a radio show to talk  to somebody.  Yeah.  You're a big Farner fan?  Yes, I grew up listening to Farner.  I...  listening to Farner and you like Lou Graham. 
[03:34:30]  Have you heard, uh, Kelly?  Uh, yes.  He sounds just like...  Ramon!  Ramon!  Kelly is a girl!  Steve sounds a little, uh, preoccupied.  Ramon!  Lou Graham is a faggot.  All right. 
[03:35:00]  Somebody didn't take their medication this morning.  Yeah, that's what it sounds like.  Yeah.  Wow.  Ramon!  This guy sucks dicks.  All right, Steve.  Steve.  I think we've had it with you.  Kelly, I'm sorry.  Sometimes you get calls that get through and, uh...  They just want to be silly.  We'll beep that out.  We'll beep that out.  Ramon!  You know, that is your crowd, though.  Yeah, unfortunately, that is a few of them.  A few bad apples, as we like to call them.  Oh, wow.  A little pile of a whole bunch. 
[03:35:30]  Hey, uh, you get the hot ladies there?  What are you?  What are you from...  What are you down here from Florida?  Do you get the hot ladies or...  You get the hot ladies or what are you?  Or, like, the ladies now older and stuff.  Well, you know, there's...  Like, what kind of crowd is going to see Foreigner with Kelly Hanson?  I gotta tell you, it's like everybody.  I see 18-year-old dudes with studs through their lips.  Really?  Who know all the lyrics.  Yeah, it's one of...  Some people call them guilty pleasures. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, there was this girl there, a 15-year-old girl, who knew all the words to all the songs.  What's your favorite Foreigner song?  Well, I don't really have a favorite.  You know, it changes night to night, because depending on the show...  Yeah, I liked Jukebox Hero.  Oh, Jukebox Hero is absolutely great.  I liked Centerfold.  No, it was that other guy.  All right, let's say hi to Ben in Boston.  That wasn't him?  Ben in Boston.  You're on with Kelly Hanson, the new lead singer of Foreigner. 
[03:36:30]  Hey, dude, dude, dude.  What's up, Ben?  Dude, what are you guys playing in Boston?  When are we playing in Boston?  Wants to know when you're playing in Boston, Kelly.  Well, we're not...  I met Luke Graham one time.  Dude, I met Luke Graham one time.  He was doing cock with Tom Brady.  He was doing what?  He was doing blow with Tom Brady.  Tom Brady from the Patriots, I guess.  Yeah, we don't know if Luke Graham did blow with Tom Brady. 
[03:37:00]  That's just Ben's opinion.  Haller seems very ill-informed.  Yeah, yeah.  Ben from Boston.  Ben, you still there?  Yeah.  All right.  Do you have a real question for Kelly?  Yeah, yeah.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  No, we don't have no one today.  We got a Luke Graham.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Sounds like he's spinning around on a wheel.  He probably is.  All right.  Thank you, Ben, from Boston. 
[03:37:30]  Well, Kelly, how do people find out where you guys are going to be performing?  Well, they can go to ForeignerOnline.com, and they can go to the tour dates page.  Okay.  Or you can call me at my home directly.  Really?  I'm not giving you the number, but if you found it, you could call me there directly.  You know, we got some samples of you singing with me.  Yeah, I want to hear some of this, because you'll be amazed.  We listened to it a while ago, and you do a really good job.  Well, thanks. 
[03:38:00]  Let's pop a little in.  Yeah, which one you want us to play?  Cold as Ice, Feels Like the First Time, Jukebox, Hero, Long, Long Way from Home, Urgent, Waiting for a Girl.  What, are you asking me?  Yeah.  I don't hear, Feels Like the First Time.  How about Rosanna?  That's another band.  That was Toto.  A Little Taste of Foreigner with Kelly Hanson. 
[03:38:30]  Well, the band sounds good.  I would climb any mountain, sail across the stormy sea, if that's what it takes me, baby, to show 
[03:39:00]  how much you mean to me.  And I guess it's just the woman in you that brings out the man in me.  I know I'm here to help myself.  You're all in the world to me.  It feels like the first time.  It feels like the very first time. 
[03:39:30]  It feels like the first time.  It feels like the very first time.  Wow.  Kelly, come on.  That's pretty good, dude.  That's amazing.  Oh, thank you.  Very nice.  No, that's really, you're right on.  Because I've got to tell you, Queen's trying to do the same thing without Freddie Mercury.  And who do they got?  The dude from Bad Company.  Paul Rogers.  Paul Rogers.  And it's just a disaster. 
[03:40:00]  I've got to be honest with you.  It's a disaster.  We had samples of that as well, and we weren't digging that at all.  I haven't heard anything.  I mean, I haven't heard it myself.  It sounds like Bad Company doing Queen songs.  What?  It sounds like Bad Company doing Queen songs.  He must have killed them like karaoke.  It sounds like a weird choice to me.  Huh?  Yeah, right?  I don't know.  I'm going to sing a foreigner song.  Yeah, do you ever go into a karaoke bar and tell them to put on a foreigner thing and just freak everybody out?  That's the only way I get free drinks?  Yeah, I bet.  All right, we've got one more question because we're running out of show here. 
[03:40:30]  It's Eric from Breathtown.  Let's say hi to Eric.  Eric, what's up?  Hello?  Eric.  Hi, can I speak to Kelly, please?  All right, Kelly's on the line.  Hey, man.  How are you doing?  Good.  Cool.  How is it touring with the band and stuff?  What's that?  How is it touring with the band?  You sound exactly like Lou, man.  It's great.  We're having a great time.  The crazy thing is that this summer we're not even on a bus.  We're like flying everywhere because we just started in March.  So it's like I haven't seen more airports than you can believe. 
[03:41:00]  But we're having a great time with the band, hanging out.  It's just really great.  Do you like how eloquently I answered that question?  Wow, pretty good.  No, it's just Ramone.  Lou Graham has AIDS.  Oh, jeez.  What is wrong with him?  Is there...  Ramone!  The screener didn't pick up that this was Steve again? 
[03:41:30]  I'd rather listen to Gary Glitter's computer collection.  Ramone!  I would have heard better sounds coming out of Adam Walsh's hat.  Look, Steve.  Steve, you've had your fun.  You're a star for the day, Steve.  Ramone!  This gets sucked.  Are you happy, Steve?  You got on again. 
[03:42:00]  Ramone!  Bring me your cover band.  All right.  Jesus.  Ramone!  All right, we get it.  I'll have two with whatever he's having.  Yeah.  All right, thank you.  Well, Kelly, you sound great.  And where are you guys playing?  Atlantic City?  Yeah, we're playing at the House of Blues in Atlantic City.  Nice.  Playing there tonight, actually.  I mean, you sound just like...  Wow, Lou.  It really is amazing.  Continued success for you guys.  Well, thank you very much, 
[03:42:30]  and I appreciate you guys taking the time.  No problem, man.  I mean, you woke me up, but what am I going to do?  You did great.  Go play some cards.  Jimmy, where were you?  We've been on the phone.  No, one of our guys just came back in the studio.  Downstairs.  Should I play roulette, or should I play blackjack?  Three-card poker.  Three-card is where it's at.  Really?  Yeah, you don't have to do anything.  You just kind of watch the cards.  It's nice.  Oh, well, that's...  No real strategy.  Jimmy, you got something for Kelly Hansen before we let him go?  No, no.  I heard that you're really good, man, so good luck to you. 
[03:43:00]  I heard that.  Actually, I was downstairs with a security guy.  One of the guys wants to come up and watch the show, and I'm like, I don't know.  All right.  All right.  Do you have him out?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it was just like they have to get clearance.  They have to get somebody from up here to go down there.  All right.  Do they have any clearance to come up to see you?  Absolutely.  Yeah, we have security there.  Hey, we're running out of show.  The computer's going to knock us off the air.  Kelly Hansen, thank you.  Continued success.  We've got to say thanks to Bill Burr for stopping by.  Caroline's all this weekend.  Yeah, come on down.  We're taking a day off.  We'll see you guys sometime next week.  Kelly, thank you.  All right.  Thanks, man. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, God.  That's wonderful.  That was a lot of fun.  Yeah, right.  Hack it up.  I've had it.  I thought they said hack it up.  I'm like, well, we did.  I can't believe we got paid for this shit, to be honest with you.  Anyone else have a money clip I could borrow?  Money clip?  This one's full.  Yeah.  Maybe you should just have those ones.  You don't have extra money clips laying around it?  With your big wad of cash, this is a gap in a spark plug, doll. 
[03:44:00]  That's funny.  Oh, kids.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha </pre>
