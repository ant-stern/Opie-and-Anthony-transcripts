<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a surprising introduction by Larry King, quickly transitioning into a discussion about the hosts' cleaning ladies and their varying levels of thoroughness, leading to humorous anecdotes and anxieties.  This segued into a highly offensive and graphic discussion of the show *Hoarders*, focusing on episodes featuring animal hoarders. Opie and Anthony used extremely vulgar language to describe the hoarders' living conditions and lack of concern for their animals and families, criticizing the show's portrayal of the situations and the therapists' approaches.  The segment included references to previous show segments like “Tree Fort Richard,” Anthony’s failed attempt at using Spanish with his cleaning lady, and a bizarre E-Rock anecdote about used condoms, all resulting in further crude humor and banter.

The show then aired a segment of a hoarder cleanup, focusing on Stacey and her severely neglected animals. The hosts and the unseen audience reacted with highly offensive and derogatory comments about Stacey, her children, and the appalling conditions of her home. The segment graphically depicted the removal of numerous animals by hazmat-suited workers, highlighting the animals' severe health problems.  The hosts expressed outrage over the legal limitations of Animal Control, which allowed Stacey to retain some animals despite the neglect.  Following this, a listener called in, appalled by the content.  This sparked a lengthy discussion about Adam Carolla’s apology to GLAAD for anti-LGBTQ+ remarks, escalating into further offensive commentary from the hosts regarding LGBT issues and other social groups.  The show also mentioned upcoming guests: Bob Kelly, Penn Jillette, Paul E.D., and Joel McHale. The segment concluded with a discussion about Elvis Presley's death anniversary and Frank DiCaro's gay wedding broadcast on Sirius XM.


The next segment focused on Adam Carolla's apology and the ensuing controversy. Opie and Anthony discussed their own experiences with forced apologies, using the example of "Homeless Charlie," and played audio of their own insincere apologies. They debated retaliating against GLAAD, potentially removing their content from iTunes if Carolla's podcast was removed, discussing free speech, humor, and the tactics of special interest groups.  A caller mentioned a college roommate's planned Apple boycott related to Carolla's podcast. Bob Kelly was in-studio, with Paulie D and Joel McHale expected as guests. The hosts also discussed a fire at Rich Voss's condo.

The show continued with a humorous bit about Christopher Walken reading "The Three Little Pigs," followed by Bob Kelly promoting his shows. The main focus then shifted to an in-studio interview with Pauly D from *Jersey Shore*.  They discussed filming in Italy, paparazzi, his DJ career, his spin-off show, relationships with other cast members (particularly Ronnie and Sammi's conflict), touring with Britney Spears and Nicki Minaj (including a lap dance from Britney), his post-*Jersey Shore* career, his friendship with Vinny, and Vinny's comedic uncle.  The conversation then returned to internal office humor, focusing on a lavishly funded gay wedding in the office and jokes about Bob Kelly's observations of Jim Norton's pubic hair. A video of Bob Kelly smoking a stranger's cigar was shown, followed by a brief conversation with Joel McHale, concluding with more jokes and banter.

The final segment featured Joel McHale as a guest. The conversation started with complaints about the studio's heat, then moved to McHale's role in *Spy Kids 4*, which he downplayed compared to Roland's exaggerations.  They discussed the movie's production, Robert Rodriguez's style, and CGI.  The conversation touched on *Toddlers & Tiaras*, McHale's show *The Soup*, other reality TV shows, McHale's work on *Community*, its production quality compared to other shows,  his experiences with celebrities (Kardashians, Prince), and the differences between network and reality television. Bobby Kelly was also present and participated. The segment included humorous back-and-forth about Roland's exaggerations, anecdotes about McHale’s experiences, and ended with promotional plugs for McHale's projects. The segment also contained numerous references to McHale’s armpit sweat, culminating in a photo opportunity where the hosts asked him to raise his arms.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hogging. You know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  By the way.  Morning, boys. That's Jamie in Puerto Rico. Wow.  What's up, Jamie?  Hola.  Sure some Jaime?  As they say.  Huh?  Sure some Jaime.  Jaime.  Jaime.  Remember we all called him Jaime, because someone had a speech impediment? 
[00:01:00]  Jaime.  Was it Kevin or something that would say that?  Someone would say Jaime.  I didn't want to blow up his spot by name.  Oh.  I don't know what his name was.  Where's he now?  But I learned years after the fact that I think his name is just Jaime.  Jaime.  But the guy used to call him Jaime.  Jaime.  What was that about?  What are all those guys?  Ah, gonzo.  Should we do a Where Are They Now?  An XM edition? 
[00:01:30]  A retrospective.  I will just say a better place.  Yeah.  Wherever that is.  Wherever that may be.  You know, Red Eye last night, they did listener submissions for the question.  Oh, really?  And I got my question.  It was from Tree Fort Richard.  Oh, wow.  Hey.  Show references always make me laugh when it's outside of the show.  It's just always, it's a weird comforting thing when somebody does a show reference in  a weird location.  It's like, ah. 
[00:02:00]  Yes.  He's familiar.  Yeah.  With what we do.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah.  Interactive.  That's what they're doing.  This is through Twitter or something.  I think it was before.  Yeah.  I just enjoyed Tree Fort Richard.  That's funny.  Very, very nice.  Tree Fort Richard, that fruit.  And now there's a ha ha ha ha.  I don't know. 
[00:02:30]  Jamie in Puerto Rico is now saying ha ha ha ha.  I don't know what that even means.  J-A-J-A-J-A.  Ha ha ha ha.  Oh, that's probably ha ha ha ha.  Well, and in Puerto Rico.  Españoli.  Yeah.  You know, I got a cleaning lady that barely speaks English.  Yeah.  Most of them.  Jimmy might know her as well.  She's great.  So I turned Jimmy on to my cleaning lady.  So we share cleaning ladies.  Hey.  And we don't ask about the other guy ever.  Yeah.  I don't know what, I don't want to know what she's cleaning at Jimmy's place. 
[00:03:00]  I don't want to know that she's paying, oh, he's paying for four rooms when I'm paying  for one.  I don't know how he looks at a good deal.  No, she's, she's fucking, I had to tell her.  Not to be in my closets because she is OCD and it literally is, but she's amazing.  Like everything is cleaned and neat.  And I told her, like, you can't go in there and touch my boxing gloves and stuff that I  have, like, you know, collectibles.  Don't start straight and that shit.  It's funny.  She's cleaning off the Sharpie marks on everything you own.  Why did the man write his name all over this?  He's ruining the value. 
[00:03:30]  It's funny you should say that because my girl there is a little upset because she lost,  I think, an iPhone charger or something.  And the cleaning lady found one deep in her closet.  As in, what the fuck are you looking that closely in a closet for?  But like Jimmy says, she's got some serious OCD issues, man.  I keep her eye, she doesn't go in my closets anymore.  Like, I've asked her a couple times since then and she's like, no, no, no.  Like, she doesn't go near him anymore.  Yeah.  You just got to tell her if you don't want her to go.  Because she's very thorough.  Like, the lady I had before her, I think we just walk in and go, and then turn around 
[00:04:00]  and walk back out.  It's a fucking nightmare.  You got to have it.  If I didn't have somebody cleaning you, what a fucking pigsty I would live in.  My whole place was disgusting without it.  It's a luxury.  I like that luxury.  I don't have a lot of luxuries, but that's one I fucking love.  Did you just catch me feeling guilty about that?  Like, I don't know how to have a fucking cleaning lady?  Yeah.  Well, my first cleaning lady when I was still at the old joint where the mice were  and the cockroaches and all that, I told you guys, she was a big Polish woman that had, 
[00:04:30]  I think, emphysema, and I would hide downstairs because I felt so guilty someone was cleaning  my shit.  Watching her clean.  And all you would hear from upstairs is, oh, as she's cleaning.  And I felt like she was going to drop dead in my place at any moment.  Yeah.  You know, you get certain amenities with certain positions in this world.  And cleaning, people that clean your shit up is pretty good.  And at first, you do seem like that.  You're like, oh, I don't know what to do. 
[00:05:00]  I'm kind of standing around watching, trying not to get in the way, but I don't want to  relax on the couch watching TV while I'm doing that.  This is a while ago.  Believe me.  Because now I get home and the first thing I say is, clean my shit.  No, no.  Because they're cleaning my shit.  The first thing I say is, is upstairs done?  Yes, Mr. Anthony.  Good.  I'm napping.  Right.  And I go into bed and I peel back the sheets of the bed that was just made, throw all those 
[00:05:30]  10,000 pillows on my bed all over the place.  And I'm out like a light.  I don't care anymore.  That's a great point.  Because when I first started getting cleaning ladies, it brings me back to a kid where it  was like Saturday morning and we all have to clean.  So next thing you know, I'm cleaning alongside the cleaning lady.  I'm like, what the fuck am I doing?  I don't have to do this shit anymore.  My mother was maniacal with us when we were growing up.  You all had chores, right?  Me and my brother and my sister. 
[00:06:00]  It wasn't chores.  It was mom was a very angry person at that point.  And she's working like three jobs trying to pay the rent and raise three kids with no  help from pops.  And she would take it out on us on Saturday mornings.  It was a nightmare.  Like as a kid, you loved Saturday.  Right.  But Saturday morning would roll around and we'd just hear like on the bedroom door, all 
[00:06:30]  right, get up.  What are you doing?  And then all I know is I'd see my little sister there, like almost in tears with a can of  pledge and an old rag, just dusting the furniture.  My brother's vacuuming, looking over his shoulder.  I'm fucking scrubbing something, crying.  It just, it was, and she's like, come on, this place looks like a bomb hit it.  It's like, really, mom?  Really?  Does the place look like a bomb hit it? 
[00:07:00]  Is that how bad this is?  You just described our house exactly as well.  And then we, but we had two chores.  We had to clean the whole fucking house.  And that's why I hate vacuums to this day.  It's not even a joke.  And then we had to go do cement work in the yard.  Oh, God.  Because my dad decided he needed pads all over the place that led to nowhere.  And then you realize years later, that was just to keep us fucking busy.  And out of my mom's hair, who, you know, had some issues, obviously. 
[00:07:30]  Once it was like done, well, as we were doing it, I just remember looking at my brother and  sister and me, we all looked like, you ever see a dog that's afraid of its owner?  And whenever the owner gets behind it, the tail goes between the legs.  They look behind him with that look like, yeah, that was mom coming into the room to make  sure you were vacuuming good enough.  And shit like that.  And the only way to get out of the house was after a couple of hours of doing this. 
[00:08:00]  Hours?  Yeah, it was hours.  You lived in small places, didn't you?  No shit.  But it was always something.  What are you doing?  Get this.  The stove had to like be dismantled and cleaned and put back together again.  So why the fuck do you like cleaning guns?  Well, because it smells great.  Yeah, but I mean.  A good gun is an efficient gun.  But doesn't that bring you back to the days of.  No, not at all.  Because you could sit there with your feet kicked up and just slowly watch TV while you're  doing it.  Well, I think you learn after many years that that's all about just keeping you fucking 
[00:08:30]  busy.  It's just that's all it was.  And the only way to get rid of her was was like the phone would ring and we'd all be  like, please, please be one of her like fucking hour long phone call girlfriends.  Oh, hi, Alice.  You'd hear you'd hear like, you know.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Jenny.  Yeah.  How the hell are you?  Then all of a sudden she kicks her feet up, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And and then and then you'd walk in and go, I'm going out.  I'm going out.  And she would shoo you away like, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:09:00]  No, no.  Same old shit.  Same old shit.  And like show us out.  And we leave that cartoon, the curly cartoon smoke as we ran out the door to get the fuck  away from the slavery freedom.  That was Saturday.  And then our Saturday could start.  And then you fast forward.  And now we got cleaning ladies.  Nice.  Now the cleaning lady's got to take my shit.  What the fuck is that?  I'm very, very cordial.  Okay.  And she's the whip cracker over there. 
[00:09:30]  I don't feel comfortable talking about my cleaning lady.  No.  I still feel like I'm a fucking, you know, college kid making no money.  I don't know.  I don't know what that's about.  But you got to take some of the some of those good things.  I decided I decided yesterday that I'm going to try my Spanish out.  This is why I brought it up.  Oh, because I was walking around the house.  I'm like, man, she barely speaks English.  I didn't say puta.  So I started like I took six years of Spanish. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, you should be able to.  And I passed.  I barely passed, but I passed.  So I'm like, okay, I want to see how important this was because finally I could really use it.  Because it's not like you see someone on the street and maybe you say, oh, it's like someone that's actually in your house.  So I tried to speak Spanish and I was trying to, like, recite dialogues that I remembered.  Oh.  And none of it matched up at all.  Really?  None of it.  Was she laughing at you?  Yeah, she was.  Yeah. 
[00:10:30]  Because I said, no estamos sortos, hijo.  What does that mean?  Mars is cringing.  Because she said something.  So I go, no estamos sortos, hijo.  And I think that means I'm not deaf or something.  No, wait a minute.  You're talking about the dialogue with, ay caramba, cuando arreglan mi cuarto.  Yeah.  No estamos sortos, hijo.  Every time I clean my room.  Oh, you remember?  Yeah, yeah, I remember that one.  I can't find anything.  But no estamos sortos, hijo, is like, stop yelling at me. 
[00:11:00]  No, it's not.  I know.  I learned that yesterday, idiot.  She looked at me like, what the fuck?  I can never find anything.  Yeah, but you're, ay caramba is like, kind of darn it.  I know that one.  Cuando arreglan mi cuatro.  Cuando arreglan mi cuatro.  Something like that.  Whenever I clean my room.  Whenever I clean my room.  Whenever they clean my room.  Whenever they clean my room, I can't find anything.  No estamos sortos, hijo.  And that, oh, that's the other dialogue where she goes, stop shouting, hijo. 
[00:11:30]  Or stop shouting, son.  Oh, stop shouting, you fucking little prick.  And then, I'm not deaf or something.  Ah, yeah.  Yeah, because it was, uh, it was Mama Tia Luisa.  Como, como grita, hijo.  You remember this?  I've been reciting.  Mama Tia Luisa, Aunt Louise, like, Mom, Aunt Louise.  And she goes, hey, hey, shut the fuck up.  I can hear you.  A mile away.  Little prick.  I go steal something.  The only reason you remember this, this is the only dialogue I've recited over the years. 
[00:12:00]  Yes, of course.  Oh, okay.  Everyone knows that one from the big old Spanish book.  Huh?  Sordos.  Sordos.  Sordos.  What's sordos?  Is that, like, what happens?  Death.  Death.  Not death.  Yeah, death.  No estamos sordos.  That's what I said.  No estamos sordos, hijo.  Bajo. Bajo. Bajo. Bajo.  She just looked at me and started laughing. I'm like, fuck.  And then she's on a phone speaking Spanish like she's a fucking rocket scientist.  I'm like, this broad, if she wasn't in America, is probably really smart. 
[00:12:30]  But she sounds silly.  But she's in America, so she's just a dummy.  But you don't know what she's talking about anyway, even though she's talking it quickly, it could be anything.  Oh, I know.  It's probably gibberish.  And this man has two heads of lettuce on the same shelf.  And I've specifically told him, put one head of lettuce here and then one head in the drawer.  It's probably all nonsense.  Cleaning lady stuff.  That's got to suck.  I was reading an article in the paper this weekend.  And I had to laugh because it's sort of in the same thing we're talking about here. 
[00:13:00]  An African king or prince.  No, I think he's an African king.  I just have to say that.  He's the king of his village back home, right?  Comes to America.  He has to be taking the world off Astoria.  Huh?  Oh, yeah, yeah, exactly.  Yeah, well.  Very good.  We should play that clip now.  Jaffee Jaffer.  He's a cab driver in New York.  Ah.  Going with what I just said.  Like, in his country, he's the fucking shit.  Yeah.  The king shit.  Prince over there.  I know. 
[00:13:30]  And they say that, but are they telling the truth?  I know.  What are they going to say?  Like, yeah, it's a cabbie there, too?  Yeah.  They'd probably feel like dicks.  No.  Really?  That's a horrible cab over there, too, I bet.  Yeah.  It's made of sticks and mud.  It's a rickshaw.  Or it's a yak that they just paint yellow.  Yellow yak.  So what's no estamos sordos hijo mean?  Why are you laughing so hard?  You're fucking it all up.  You're trying to say we're not death, son.  Yeah.  We're not death, son.  Because he was like, ma, ma, tia Luisa. 
[00:14:00]  So can I just say nos estamos sordos?  Sordos.  Sordos.  Sordos.  Sordos.  You don't have to make that face, though.  The best part of my six years of Spanish, the final year, was taught in Spanish.  No one was allowed to speak English.  And I fucking passed.  Like that.  And I don't know shit.  Ugh.  School sucks.  Wow.  They did a bang-up job.  A bang-up job.  Look, I passed with maybe like a 70.  I'm not going to like break too much here.  But I passed. 
[00:14:30]  You'll squeak by, Spicoli.  But man, my fucking brother, because he's been in the restaurant industry his whole life,  he gets in the kitchen with, you know, the Marses.  Yeah.  And he fucking.  Marses.  No, no.  Those guys don't have papers.  Huh?  Those guys don't have papers.  My brother's fucking up.  How dare you?  My brother's on the fucking up and up, motherfucker.  My bad.  It's all legit.  My bad.  My bad.  They don't have cars, so he buys the boys bicycles and stuff so they can get to work.  He's a good guy, unlike me.  Bicycles. 
[00:15:00]  He probably takes the seats, though.  But he's in that fucking kitchen, man.  Holy shit.  And he didn't take any Spanish.  Just got to pick that shit up.  He picked it up because he's in the restaurant industry.  That works.  It's an amazing, easy language.  Oh, really?  Spanish is the easiest language there is.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Simple.  So I said adios.  What else did I say yesterday?  I said a couple little things. 
[00:15:30]  That's hilarious.  You just make it sound like, yeah, I knew some Spanish.  I pulled out my adios.  I said bueno and then muy bueno.  Ah, well.  That got across.  I said gracias because I am.  Yes, you're thankful.  Thankful.  Of course.  But then the dialogue shit went nowhere.  Did you give her a por favor?  Ah, please.  Did I?  Yesterday?  I've used por favor in the house.  And that's about it.  How about no me gusta or me gusta?  I don't know what the fuck that means. 
[00:16:00]  What's that?  I don't like it or I like it.  What's the word?  Me gusta?  Oh, my gusta.  Like if you lose your goose.  Yeah.  Oh, she said caliente yesterday.  I said muy caliente because it was very hot.  I'm going to tape this shit.  I have to tape this shit because it's so fucking embarrassing.  What day did she?  She's at my place today.  Actually, when I get home, she'll be there.  So tape her.  Say, embeza mi culo.  Oh, no. 
[00:16:30]  Watch I tape her and Mars says she's having me killed.  She's saying something how she'll have me bled out like a lamb over my fucking...  Listen, you can come in and we'll cut his throat over the cat box.  Ah, fuck.  I mean, we kind of look down on some of these people, but the fact is they know two languages.  We don't know shit.  We know one.  I don't like the people that just know one language that isn't English.  I don't like that stuff.  That's inconvenient for me.  What did you say, by the way, over there that made Sam cringe? 
[00:17:00]  Oh, kiss my ass.  Oh, nice.  Just tell him to kiss my ass.  Nice.  So that didn't work out too well.  Six years of Spanish, and I can't do shit with it.  Six years of college down the drain.  Yeah.  Anyway.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Somebody mentioned hoarders. 
[00:17:30]  That was a disgusting one last night.  Which one was it?  We were tweeting it.  I don't know if that guy was actually talking about that episode, but there was another animal hoarder.  Those are the worst.  Those are the worst me, me, me people.  Because there's the garbage ones.  And this one, she had a 14-year-old daughter that's just crying all the time.  She can't live with her mother.  And her mother's just like, you know, delusional.  They're all delusional.  But she's just like, do you think it's okay to have this many animals? 
[00:18:00]  And she's like, do you think the animals are healthy?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She goes, how many have died in your care?  She goes, well, one, I think, like a year ago.  And meanwhile, there's carcasses everywhere.  What kind of animals are there?  Cats.  Dogs.  This woman had a house full of dogs.  Yeah.  The smell coming off of this place, it came through the television.  Now, which one of them has the animals?  The fatty, of course.  That's the dog. 
[00:18:30]  That fat fucking waste of life.  And there's just dead animals all over the place.  Are there bugs there, too?  Oh, yeah.  The bugs.  And this guy.  That right there.  He's crawling around.  He can't even walk through his house.  He's got to crawl around.  The black guy?  Yeah.  You don't see that many black hoarders.  Mostly white people.  It's true.  Wait, why is the black guy part of this?  He was one of the hoarders.  Two different stories.  Oh, two different stories.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Hoarders likes hitting you with a double shot.  I like that.  Double shot of hoarders. 
[00:19:00]  You only need one, though, man.  Oh, I know.  They like to go to one.  They run parallel with the progress of the stories.  Yeah.  It's to keep the drama up.  Like, they'll show some kind of confrontation.  And then, but, they'll go to the other story and make you go like,  Hey, but what happened to the other fat lady?  I'm mad at Jimmy.  What happened?  There's never progress with these people.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no, no.  I meant the story progression.  Not the necessary of the people.  But that's all bullshit.  Because in the end, there's no fucking progress that takes place in these people's minds.  I agree.  I think it's really tough to change your behavior. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Really.  Almost impossible.  I know people do it.  And you're out there.  And congratulations to you.  But most people go right back to fucking hoarding.  Because this is a mental.  Look at these fucking assholes.  This is a mental illness that is looked at like, all right, this is silly.  Just get rid of your shit.  It goes so much deeper than that.  And I'm not making an excuse.  I still think just firebomb the houses, get the bulldozer in, and build a nice house for  somebody that wants to keep it nice.  But, like, they're fucked up so badly. 
[00:20:00]  This woman has a daughter that can't live with her.  And the shrink is asking her, don't you want your daughter to live with you, don't you?  She goes, well, you know, we text every day.  And try to rationalize that it's okay that animals are dying.  Go back a little, Sam.  In your house.  And it stinks to the point where the woman that came to help her goes, can we talk outside?  Wow.  Like, furniture is completely ripped up.  And just shit was everywhere. 
[00:20:30]  Dog shit everywhere.  Because she loves her animals.  I can't be without them.  And they can't be without me.  It's like, do you understand how these animals would love to be away from your fat, fucking,  needy ass?  Does she bug you?  Me.  Me.  You know, I try to stay out of these conversations.  Because I can't even watch these shows anymore.  Does that fat lady want to smack her?  Oh, you have no fucking idea.  The me, me, me shit.  I am so fucking done with.  It's the worst to watch.  Intervention's another one. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  I watch that show.  With a whole family's got to get involved.  Go fuck yourself.  Christine, you've been my sister for many years, but not for the past ten, I think.  And she's just sitting there like, fuck, when can I shoot up or smoke cracker?  But don't you think, don't you think you're playing right into that person's fucking psyche?  Oh, the me, me, me part?  Yeah, because she's sitting there like, oh, look, everyone has to read their letters now.  Hey, I'm on stage.  Read your letters.  Read your fucking letters. 
[00:21:30]  This is what I've wanted.  I would be tough love all the way.  Yeah, just don't give them the ultimatum that if they go to treatment, you won't kick them out.  Because that's usually what they say.  They say, if you don't accept this gift, this gift of treatment, I will not let you stay in the house anymore.  We will lock the doors so we will not feed you or clothe you.  And the people are usually like, okay, I'll go.  And I know it's been done many different ways, but who the fuck is still believing this is a documentary on addiction? 
[00:22:00]  If you know anything about drug addicts and shit, this is what they like to do.  Fucking do their drugs and sit in front of a TV.  So they know more about TV than the average person to begin with.  So who the fuck is still buying this concept?  Well, it's getting to the point now where the people walk into the hotel room and they go, I fucking knew it.  Right.  Yes, you did.  Oh, her face is so slappable.  Every reporter's face is punchable.  She looks like Stephen Wright if you were a fat woman. 
[00:22:30]  She has a long, slappable face.  We're going to have to play this trailer now.  Now there's the daughter who I said looked like Iraq with braces.  Oh, wow.  She looked like Iraq.  She does.  She has Iraq on us.  She looks busier.  I'm teasing you.  I'm kind of Iraq.  Is it bad you don't have any sympathy for these people?  Nah.  Is it bad you don't have sympathy for people like this in your own life?  No.  You've had enough sympathy probably over the years.  That's why.  It's not like you've never had sympathy.  No.  You've had many years of sympathy and after a while it gets to be draining. 
[00:23:00]  I mean, you're like, enough.  I've given enough sympathy to you.  Enough.  Why do we have to, all ears have to be paying attention to this lady?  Yes.  And nothing's going to change in the end.  So why are you, why are you even trying?  And there's a big like meeting every, every, every episode, there's meetings where they  have to talk about why they need that one wheel that went on the chair that is not being  thrown away.  But the wheel's good and I could use it on another chair if a wheel falls.  And they're trying to tell, look, do you, now let's think about it instead of taking 
[00:23:30]  the wheel and going, can I see the wheel?  And then from three feet away, wailing it into the bridge of her fucking nose.  Go, there you go.  Now, now do you like the wheel?  I want to do a show where we, all of us, let's do this.  No, no, we don't do it.  We let these idiots do it.  And the cleaning crews and all that.  And then, cause they don't really go back and see what happens to these people.  They only show the maybe one or two that are kind of a success story.  And, and our show, our show is going to be called, they don't fucking change. 
[00:24:00]  And we go back to see him doing the same shit again.  Yeah.  And then we're not as nice as this, uh, this, uh, this, uh, this hoarded show is.  She has roaches walking around in broad daylight.  She's bad roaches.  Like they're all over the place.  And she actually believes she's, that these animals love her and she loves the animals.  You know what it is?  She likes when they all wait for her when she's watering.  Yeah.  Look at her bathroom.  Cute.  Oh, she's killable. 
[00:24:30]  This lady.  I thought you were going to say when you said, uh, you know, she sees the roaches, uh, roaches  that she actually believes that's a sign from her dead father.  I like the girl era.  Girl Iraq had me laughing during the entire episode last night.  That is girl Iraq.  All right.  Let's listen to this fucking thing.  Hoarders.  Yeah.  With animals now.  Oh, it's my sweet love.  Sweet love as it's in a cage.  It is very hard for Taylor.  She wants to, you know, be a kid and it makes it difficult for her to live her life. 
[00:25:00]  It's just, it's overwhelming.  Taylor is a good kid.  I mean, she's probably the most adult person in the family.  Oh, that's the daughter.  That's Iraq, Taylor.  Look at Iraq.  I can't have a normal life because of my mom's decisions.  She's just destroying me.  Sam's laughing.  Hold on.  I saw that last night and couldn't stop laughing. 
[00:25:30]  I'm enraged.  Oh, shit.  Because that's the fucking problem right there that I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm understanding.  The kids have fucking problems.  So guess what?  You eliminate the mother and everyone is fucking healthier and happier.  That's enraging, man.  I can't.  Just.  You hate the fact that the fucking mother just keeps making the same decisions even though  the kid is hurting.  Yeah.  Of course. 
[00:26:00]  The kid, by the way, can't even live in the house.  They took her out of the house.  And this fucking woman is arguing over little, trinkety, dirty fucking shit instead of thinking  of her daughter.  She's like, well, I want to keep that.  I want to be in control of these people are throwing things away and I haven't looked at  it yet.  When meanwhile, it's like, look, your daughter was taken away.  Wouldn't you take everything out of your house until it's bare floor walls and ceiling  and start over and allow your daughter back in your house? 
[00:26:30]  You selfish, fat fucking need conditioner cunt.  I will never understand mental illness to where it gets to the point where kids, you  can't like do the right thing for your fucking kids.  Sorry.  And I don't want to listen to anybody.  I'm not.  I'm in no mood.  I will not listen to anybody.  Poor little leader.  I don't.  I don't get it.  How old is she that's not getting out of the house?  She's 14, I think.  14.  And taking out of the house?  So she's better off.  Yeah.  Yeah, but she doesn't see it.  Someone get to her and go, look, you're better the fuck off.  She doesn't see it as that.  She's going to see it as a mother abandonment. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Which, you know, I'll get to come and play a little later in life.  Which I do appreciate.  She's going to be right where you need her.  Keep your chin up, kid.  You know, thank God for some of these dysfunctional mothers and fathers.  But, wow.  She should probably talk to a few 40-year-olds or guys in their 40s.  You know.  And I'll show her how much better off she could be.  How nice it is to swim in a nice, sparkling, clean pool and then go inside and barbecue.  And there's people clean up. 
[00:27:30]  Of course.  Of course, I don't want a girl that looks like E-Rock with braces.  She's cute.  She's pretty.  Well, you know.  As a chick E-Rock, I thought she was cute as a chick E-Rock, which is odd.  Mm-hmm.  You know.  I think E-Rock's getting it.  It's almost like when George was going out with the girl that looked like Jerry.  Right.  Made him feel a little weird.  He's awesome.  E-Rock's fattening himself up because he can't handle how adorable his eyes are.  Oh, is that it?  It's gotten him in trouble over the years.  His pictures.  He always has his bedroom eyes in his pictures with girls. 
[00:28:00]  He was showing me recently, like, photos from the years past.  Yeah.  And you're so right.  Every picture, he has those bedroom eyes.  Bedroom eyes.  The Paris Hilton one is the best.  Oh, yeah.  E-Rock, I'll be honest, man.  You got some fucking solid eyes there, son.  Why, thank you.  You have seductive eyes in inappropriate situations.  Oh, yeah.  I think E-Rock.  Staring at a rack of ribs.  Right?  I think E-Rock. 
[00:28:30]  No, that was funny.  I think E-Rock knocked back some numbers in his day.  I really do.  Yeah.  I really do.  I really do.  Wow.  And you were a little slender guy there, too.  I took that photo.  Oh, I was going to say, what year is that?  From 1995?  What year is that from E-Rock?  That's 2007.  7-6.  That's six?  That's five years ago only?  Yeah.  This place will fucking destroy him.  This place is horrible.  This place will destroy him.  This is like a POW camp.  E-Rock said on the after show that he used to get around quite a bit when he was younger. 
[00:29:00]  I believe.  Hubba hubba.  To the point.  He knocked him back.  That he used to take condoms out of garbage cans after he used them to make sure that  the women didn't inseminate themselves with his shoes.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  I heard this story.  Okay, good.  Tried to get through to just bash the shit out of E-Rock for not understanding what the  fuck was going on there, Mr. Ladies Man.  E-Rock told a story about using a condom with a girl, right? 
[00:29:30]  And then he went to the bathroom.  And actually, you would wrap him up and take them with you, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Take them with him because he didn't want the woman using the sperm to get that valuable  nagel seed.  Yes, the nagel seed.  Yes, the nagel seed.  So then he goes, what tipped him off to this was once he came and used the rubber.  And then the girl came back in the room and goes, what did you do with the rubber?  Because I couldn't find it.  And it's like, oh, instead of thinking, she's got another guy she's fucking that comes over 
[00:30:00]  the house.  And if he sees a used rubber in the garbage, he's going to know she's fucking you dummy.  That's why she wanted to find the rubber.  Because the next guy that's fucking her would look in the garbage, see a rubber and go,  that ain't my jizz.  That's the nagel seed.  Well, it's taking precautions.  Can I add to the story, please?  If the in-laws are listening, please turn down the radio.  Go to Classic Rewind.  Yeah, Classic Rewind.  I know you like Classic Rewind.  Give me a couple minutes with the boys, will you? 
[00:30:30]  I was such a fucking good looking guy.  I knew I had very valuable sperm.  So I would not only take my condoms home with me, I would double knot them and put them in  my front pocket and leave.  What is wrong with flushing them?  What's wrong with pulling out and just spraying her back?  Fucking Kleenex toots.  If you're going to use a rubber, you can take a little toilet paper, wrap it up in toilet  paper, and then you throw in the toilet, flush immediately before it gets a chance to 
[00:31:00]  expand.  Look, sometimes...  And it'll go right down the fucking...  Sometimes in houses, you don't know where the fucking bathroom is and you want to get  the fuck out of there.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I would never think to take my cum with me.  I would never take my cum with me.  I always took the valuable sperm with me.  Isn't that funny they call it cum?  Because you just...  I know.  You leave it everywhere.  You just want it to go.  It should be called go or leave.  Yeah, leave is better.  Oh, I left all over her back.  I would double knot that shit, put it in my front pocket, and walk out the front door. 
[00:31:30]  You and Eric used to walk around with used condoms in your face.  Jesus Christ!  Hey, you'd find a place to get rid of it.  That's crazy.  C-Rock, I'm with you today, brother.  Yeah, you threw it out the window on the highway, or you just...  Oh, great.  That's great.  That's a bounce up, hitting your windshield.  Or you throw it in the garbage can at a gas station.  How about you just throw it in her garbage can and tell her, go ahead, go in there and  drink it if you want.  How long do you think you cum last in the garbage?  I didn't want to take that chance, man.  Fuck.  Wow.  I'm going to squeeze it like an old toothpaste tube into that vag.  You're a lot nicer than I am.  Fuck.  I never wore bags. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Never!  Yeah.  You wanted a kid?  Here you go.  Fuck.  I think I have weak sperm.  Oof.  I always thought I had a potent load.  My ex was like, no, you don't.  You fucking cum at everybody.  You've never gotten one knocked up.  You're fucking cum as weak.  What is it?  Come out like skim milk?  There's a lot of it, but there's no fucking little thing swimming, I guess.  No, no, no.  I want to use that.  Spermatozoa?  No, I wanted the word for thick.  Oh.  Viscous?  Yeah, I was going to go with viscous.  Coagulated?  It's not viscous? 
[00:32:30]  I don't know.  No, I have a pretty thick load.  Is it runny?  Like runny eggs?  No, it looks like my dick is vomiting cottage cheese.  I was just...  There's an XL channel today.  Holy shit.  I was just to assume they're on something, you know?  Wow.  You must take the pill.  That's all right.  Are you serious?  I'll ask after.  Sure.  I'll ask ex post facto.  You wouldn't...  No, man.  That used to scare the fuck out of me.  Well, what are you going to do? 
[00:33:00]  You know?  Not going to take pregnant?  Wrap a condom up and put it in my pocket?  Exactly.  Like so many nickels and dimes?  Dude, I...  My entire life, I never assumed.  No.  How could you wear rubbers?  I wish I could have.  I had a no for sure, man.  I had a no for sure.  Terrible things.  And that pill thing wasn't fucking good enough, these fucking idiots.  Oh, I don't know.  Let me count.  I don't know.  I would find the pills. 
[00:33:30]  Let me count.  That pinwheel of pills.  Get the fuck out of here.  Right before I go to fuck her, I would drop it down her throat, hold her nose and her  chin like a snout, and rub her neck.  Good girl.  Good girl.  Let's fuck.  I think I took one Tuesday.  It's Friday.  I'm like, get the fuck out of here.  I think you were hoarding your own cum.  I think you were hoarding your own cum hoarder.  Yeah, it's all in a fucking little box at home.  Imagine you come over and, what's in this closet?  Oh, no.  Oh, look at that. 
[00:34:00]  Shoeboxes falling off the fucking shelves filled with, all right, you get it.  What happened to more of this girl?  Where's the girl?  I want to see more of that chick.  The fat lady.  Her fucking fat, slappable, she looks like George Washington, the dollar.  She really does.  Why are you fast forwarding?  Because that's back to the other story.  Okay.  Who cares about the brother?  All right.  I saw fatty right there.  Scotty got your commercials.  I'm talking about the video.  Don't worry.  Hoarders. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, look at this house.  The house is a fucking disaster.  Her name is Stacy from Louisiana.  At least it's not hot there.  You can't possibly keep these animals fed, loved, healthy.  If Stacy was home 24-7, she still couldn't do it.  It gets to be over 100 in the house when she goes to work.  Yes.  They're sweltering.  With her home overrun by animals, Stacy's accepted help to deal with her hoarding.  I'm Dr. Chabot.  Nice to meet you.  I'm Stacy.  Nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you.  My name is Dr. Suzanne Chabot, and I'm a specialist in the obsessive- 
[00:35:00]  Hold on.  Can you pause on fucking bass and hound eyes?  What an unfuckable doctor.  Maybe that's shallow of me.  No, and you're right.  I don't trust any therapists either, because it's like, why would you want to go into that  business?  What happened in your fucking-  Yeah, yeah.  What happened?  Your tuchus.  That you want to deal with this all day long.  You want to sit in an office with one of those couches-  Right.  And just yap to people.  Right.  Not to go to their houses and have to smell that shit.  Mmm.  You. 
[00:35:30]  Boring.  It sounds like your critics have gotten pretty excited about me coming, huh?  They're not used to strangers.  You think it's okay if I take a peek inside?  Um.  Can you pause-  We gotta pause this a lot, because this is-  Dogs are barking.  This is fucking enraging.  Why the-  Why the small talk and the light-heartedness?  I hate that.  I fucking hate that shit.  It's every time.  The hoarder comes out of her fucking shithole, shakes hands with the shrink, and they're all 
[00:36:00]  like, hey, nice to meet you.  Well, here we are.  Well, hit-  Let's talk about this one.  So she's at the front door, and you can hear the animals inside.  Yeah.  She's like, oh, they sound excited, you know, because I'm here.  Oh, excited.  No, they're begging for you to take them out of the fucking home.  Help me.  The shrink should start every fucking contact with the hoarder with a spinning back fist.  And just like, wham!  And now we'll get the therapist call, now, now. 
[00:36:30]  But you know what?  What's the difference?  Yeah.  What's the difference in the end?  What is the difference?  Because they're going to go back in six months, and it's going to be exactly the same.  Where'd she get all these dogs at?  Well, she adopted- not adopted, she found a couple of dogs.  They mated, had a litter of puppies.  She let them grow up, and they all started fucking.  Oh, shit.  And before she knew it, like, within two generations of dogs, she had a fuckload and wouldn't get  rid of them, of course, because they love her, you know? 
[00:37:00]  Right, right.  She needs the love.  I need love.  Really?  Do you?  How about your daughter?  Oh, that's right.  We could send her away.  Do you think she's putting herself above the rest of the family?  I hope he's gritting his teeth.  It's just-  Putting herself over the rest of the family just a little.  Do you think her narcissism is interfering with her motherly duties?  It's affecting the whole fucking town.  One person. 
[00:37:30]  Great.  It is, yeah, yeah.  So why don't we go back to the old days?  Get rid of the one fucking person.  I think everyone else's lives will drastically improve.  Oh, but we can't do that.  We've got to save every human life, right?  Townsfolk.  Get together the townsfolk with the torches and pitchforks.  Get her a stupid stick and whatever the fuck it's called.  The bandana?  The bandana.  She's going to be a hobo on a train?  Yeah, fill up your stupid bandana and hit the brick, sister.  There's the woods.  Road out on a rail.  That's right.  That's it. 
[00:38:00]  Go ahead, brother.  All I got to do was peek into Stacey's house.  It smells toxic.  It's nauseating.  Oh, look at the shit.  And what I could see looked awful.  There's a dead cat.  Cat shit.  Yeah, she's like, can we go somewhere else to talk?  How many animals do you have?  I'd have to stop and count again. 
[00:38:30]  She's laughing.  Quite a few.  The biggest explosion was when I picked one up on the side of the road.  And she had puppies.  And she had puppies.  And her first puppies had puppies.  She didn't think reasonably.  It's like six at a clip in a cage.  Go ahead and get the animals spayed or neutered.  And you're going to prevent this problem from getting worse.  It got so big that she was afraid to get the help that she needed.  She's already been in trouble for this. 
[00:39:00]  The bottom line is Stacey wanted to keep her animals.  She wanted to be in control of their lives.  Oh, poor leepy eye cat.  Did you ever think to yourself, I am an animal daughter?  I knew I was an animal lover.  She's a horse.  Dogs or animals die because of being in these situations.  I did have some cats last year due to maybe roach poisoning.  We're not sure.  Oh, really?  They never showed signs of being sick until I found them dead. 
[00:39:30]  Bullshit.  Stacey is in denial about the severity of the problem.  It's a progressive disorder, just like hoarding of objects.  She's not providing a healthy environment for anyone, much less the...  Look at the roaches on that wall.  They're running around on the baseboard and the wall in dog shit.  Roaches love hoarders.  Oh, don't they?  Right?  That's a couple dozen roaches right there in that one shot. 
[00:40:00]  One little shot.  Oh.  That's like a three foot by three foot area with a couple dozen roaches.  Oh, that's one little square of a fucking house.  God.  Oh, we lost a guy whose mom's a hoarder.  He's actually agreeing with us on every point.  I've never had anybody disagree with our mental illness stuff.  We bash the self-centeredness.  No one...  Once in a while you get emails going, yeah, you gotta understand.  95% of them are like, I'm so glad you guys said that. 
[00:40:30]  I'm so happy to hear people talking about that because everybody concentrates on how  fucking sad it is and how the poor victim...  But they just don't concentrate on the self-fucking-centeredness of it.  Yeah, it is.  It's like...  I know that it's a legitimate illness.  Yeah, yeah.  But at least talk about you self-centered motherfuckers or how that bothers everybody.  It's like they just don't talk about it.  No.  I don't agree how they handle it.  I just don't agree how they handle it, the professionals.  No.  Because you're supposed to coddle the person and don't you know she's sick and all that? 
[00:41:00]  But it's like she's affecting everyone around her.  Give her the choice of what she wants to keep and not keep.  But they don't do that with animals, by the way.  I'm just saying mental illness in general.  Yeah.  There's no self-awareness?  Really?  Get the fuck out of here.  I know what my issues have been over the years and I know I'm self-aware what it has done.  I've become aware.  And I've worked on it over the years.  You know.  So you're trying to tell me that people aren't self-aware about what happens to others? 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  And if they aren't, how about they open their eyes and they look around?  Some people just don't know.  How about they listen when they're told?  That's the problem.  It's once people are told and they don't listen, it's different.  Then there's no excuse.  Yeah, they seem like they're intelligent enough to understand, right?  And then she's just, you know, abandoned her fucking kid.  Whenever I had my mom in a corner growing up where I finally had her on some shit, she 
[00:42:00]  would every single time go, you know I'm sick.  End of discussion.  Oh, that was it, huh?  End of discussion.  Oh, boy.  Can't do anything else after that, right?  That's it.  That's the ace in the hole.  No, you really did some fucked up shit.  Hey, you know I'm mentally ill.  Oh, okay.  Now you're not allowed to say anything else.  Oh, really?  That would end that discussion.  And I don't think I speak for myself here today.  I think so many people have to deal with that crap.  Sam.  People use it kind of like a... 
[00:42:30]  Or I would get my dad and go, look, I got her.  I got her.  This is how fucked up this shit is.  And he would say the same shit.  You know she's sick.  It's the get out of jail free card.  Yeah, every time.  Every time.  What would you catch somebody, just like normal grown up stuff?  Like you said you were going to do this and you didn't do it, or you yelled at me in front of somebody or whatever it is?  It goes way beyond that shit.  Dumb stuff.  You know, leaving your shoes out or something in your very clean room could get her going. 
[00:43:00]  That would trigger like massive yelling.  And then your whole room would be destroyed.  It's like, well, that makes sense.  You wanted a clean room, and because the shoes were in the middle of the floor, the whole room needs to be destroyed now.  Oh, boy.  Okay, that makes sense.  And then I would go and, you know, talk to my pops about it, because he was the sane one.  Oh, you know she's sick.  Oh, okay.  Well, I'm going to go upstairs now and hopefully glue half my shit back together.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You're right.  I'm sorry.  Sorry that I brought this to your attention.  Hopefully I can salvage some of this shit. 
[00:43:30]  Maybe that's why I don't have any shit in my life.  I'm expecting it to be broken at any moment.  Oh, you're right.  I'm sorry.  You got some crazy glue, because, you know, some stuff that I consider very valuable as  a 12-year-old is now smashed.  Wow, that's brutal.  Oh, shit.  Oh, yeah.  I would hate that if I shit broken.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, my God.  Don't live in my house. 
[00:44:00]  Don't go back in time and live in my house.  Oh, I hate that.  Yeah.  I would go back in time.  I wouldn't do that.  No, no.  My house is not the place to be.  It is a time machine.  Fucking rough.  Parla's dressed like Elvis.  Elvis died.  It's Elvis's anniversary, right?  Today.  It was death.  34 years ago.  Took that legendary shit today.  He was only 42.  Yeah, huh?  I say he was only 42, because...  I'm older than Elvis was when he died? 
[00:44:30]  Fuck yeah.  You're way older.  And that fucked up when you start, like, getting older.  He looks like a little kid, though.  I don't look like an adult who was a big star.  Yeah.  Well, I'm not.  But he was an old 42, because you see the footage of Elvis.  You were convinced he had to be in his 50s at that point.  Yeah, I remember the old...  They called him the old Elvis instead of that young Elvis, but it was like, jeez.  He was only, you know...  That was back then, too.  42 was a little...  You think?  Yeah, that was a little rough.  That was 77.  That's an old age of 42?  42 then could be older than 42 now. 
[00:45:00]  People took a little bit of care of themselves back then, but Elvis wasn't really taking much  care of himself.  He was taking care of business, what he was doing.  What's old now?  Yeah, TCB.  What's old now?  Like, 75?  Well, that's real old.  You think it's real old?  I don't think it's real old.  I think once you crack that fucking 70 mark, it's hit or miss.  You think?  Yeah.  I think back when we were growing up, 60 was like the old.  You started looking at people like, fuck, they're old.  I don't see that anymore. 
[00:45:30]  No, you got to look at 70 as thinking, hey, life expectancy is what, 75?  Ooh, five years goes by quick.  74, 75, 76.  I get a lot of people on Twitter going, man, you're fucking nailing it.  If a guy can make it past 76, he's going to live way into his 80s.  Yeah.  But a lot of them never make it past 74, 75, or 76.  Yeah.  Those are the three rough ages.  Not 72.  72 easy for most guys.  It's always 74, 75, 76. 
[00:46:00]  Start falling off.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking fenders start falling off.  Fuck, I don't know what it is, man.  God figured that shit out a while ago.  Most guys die in that three-year period.  I'm telling you right in the fucking way.  Damn.  Anyway.  Still got more audio of this fucking pig.  Who do you live with?  My oldest son, Dante, lives with me.  And my 14-year-old daughter at this point is not living with me.  Her name's Taylor.  How do you feel about Taylor not being here? 
[00:46:30]  I talk to her on the phone.  We text constantly.  Oh, God.  Yes, Stacey can call her on the cell phone, but there's nothing like the day-to-day, hour-to-hour commitment.  Raising a child is a lot more challenging than taking care of the dog.  How long has Harry Dean Stanton been a woman?  Do you think she needs you as much as the animals need you?  Oh, does your daughter need you as much as the animals need you?  I knew she would be okay, and we were trying to do this on a short-term basis. 
[00:47:00]  But she lived in this.  She lived in this for a long time.  She's rationalizing.  I feel like I'm like...  Her daughter being taken away.  She's just like, well, you know, it's a short-term.  We're supposed to...  Bah, whatever happened...  It's like, do you realize you're such a fucking disgusting pig that your daughter can't live with you?  And you're making excuses up.  And I bet the therapist, her whole thing is, let's try to get the daughter back in the house.  I would say she's way the fuck better off.  Leave her right where she is. 
[00:47:30]  There's no way this woman's going to change enough where the daughter's going to have a healthy relationship  in that house with her mom.  But that dumb fucking therapist will really attempt to do just that.  Oh, yeah.  Instead of just saying, let's work on your daughter being happy without you.  Right.  And fucking stay away.  And hopefully you guys can have a nice relationship where you visit her, wherever she's living,  and maybe could have nice weekends with her or a nice night out.  Right.  But this stupid therapist, I know these people.  Let's get you all back together.  Yeah.  Sometimes, you know what?  That's not the answer. 
[00:48:00]  No.  Good mom.  I feel like I've, you know, always put my kids first.  But it didn't happen here.  It didn't happen in this situation.  I would imagine that Taylor is quite damaged at this point.  She doesn't have a mother that says, you are more important than all those animals in her home.  Oh, Roy's definitely a hoarder. 
[00:48:30]  He's got a lot of just literal junk.  Yeah, that's the black guy.  Can I keep going to the other person?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What happened to the dog lady?  I want to see what happened to that fucking disaster.  I don't like this two-story thing.  Yeah, it does get in the way sometimes.  A two-story arc.  Sometimes you do just like the one story.  What?  That's, help me, help me.  Yeah, that's talk.  Break me out of here.  Now all the fucking animal rescue people show up. 
[00:49:00]  I have to do this.  I know it's going to be the hardest thing I've ever done.  Well, not eating for an hour, maybe.  What, put tradition in your hair?  Yeah.  Dry hair.  She's hair like dryer lint.  What does that say, Jimmy?  To comply with city ordinances, Stacy's accepted help from a team of professionals to deal with 
[00:49:30]  nearly 50 animals in her shithouse.  I added shit for comic effect.  It worked.  All right.  Let's see how this works out.  You got the upbeatness.  Now watch this.  You'll love it.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Today is a very big day, right?  And for me, it's a lot different than usual.  I'm Dorothy Brenninger.  I'm a professional organizing expert, and I specialize in hoarding. 
[00:50:00]  Can you pause that?  I've obviously had a shitty childhood.  Therefore, I'll just keep that smile on my fat, dumb fucking face instead of being honest  about cutting the throats of these people.  Hi, happy day into a shitty 100-degree house with dog duty and roaches.  Yay!  I live for this.  Today's a big one.  No one's fucking honest.  Jimmy, you're so right.  They just won't be honest and go, look, look.  All right, here we are. 
[00:50:30]  Thank this thing for this.  She even penciled her eyebrows in in such a way to make happy eyebrows.  Yeah.  Because she can't wait to get in there.  Come on.  Let's dig in, guys.  Let's do this for the family.  Organizing specialists, really?  Yeah.  We're here to save lots and lots of animals.  When you organize an animal hoarder, it's all about getting the animals out first and dealing  with the trauma that goes along with it.  Usually, they don't even begin to think about their stuff until after the trauma of the animals 
[00:51:00]  is over.  We have Dr. Norris with us, who is a forensics veterinarian.  Wow, is Dr. Norris ugly?  Dr. Norris.  A team of amazing women tell us what's going to go on for today.  We're going to do a quick walk through and we're going to assess the animals and make  sure everybody's okay.  And then we're going to bring them out, vaccinate them, and then we're going to get them to shelters.  And Taylor, we're doing a lot of this for you because as a 14-year-old, you deserve a 
[00:51:30]  safe place to live.  How are you feeling about today?  Taylor's got big fat tits for a 14-year-old.  And how are you doing today, Stacey?  It's going to be a hard day.  Oh, shit.  And the most important thing is that.  Me, me, me.  Pause that.  Boy, guess what?  The person causing all the problems is finally going to have a tough day, everyone.  It's going to be a tough day for her.  I wonder how many tough days your 14-year-old daughter had.  Yeah.  Or how about everyone standing in that scene that has to wade through your shit? 
[00:52:00]  Oh, is it okay that you have a tough day?  Are you going to be okay with one tough day?  Oh, because they will have to coddle her now the entire show.  Would you like to see one hoarder go, like, you know, look, I appreciate that everybody's  doing this.  I suck.  Yeah.  I'm a disaster.  Right.  I'm a slob.  But no, their hosts can be tough for me.  I don't want to know how you're feeling.  Yeah, because that's all it's always been about is how she's feeling.  Today, it's not about you and your stupid feelings.  Yes.  It's about making other people around you maybe happy for once. 
[00:52:30]  Yep.  Fuck.  I can't watch these shows.  I love that we bring it to the show.  I cannot watch this shit.  Recovering a place for your daughter.  Are we all ready to go?  Yes.  All right.  Let's head out.  First positivity.  Dr. Norris enters the home alone to make sure it's safe for her team to come in.  Hey, guys.  They were wearing hazmat suits.  Yeah, she's in a hazmat suit.  The dogs, you know what that's got to sound like?  How the fuck does this lady sleep? 
[00:53:00]  What we have are a bunch of very enthusiastic dogs.  Enthusiastic?  We have a bunch of cats who are watching over everything.  They may be a little more difficult to deal with.  Oh, shit.  But in general, we should be able to move these out with minimal stress to the dogs.  There we go.  It's nice to see what Austin Powers is up to.  Ugly lady.  Are we watching the whole show?  I don't care because I think it's working.  No, we're just zipping through.  They're pulling animals out.  Oh, the dogs are licking faces.  They are so happy to be out of there. 
[00:53:30]  Some of those will get adopted pretty quickly.  Yeah, other ones will just go bye-bye in the box.  Oh, yeah.  The old blue fluid into the vein.  Stacey grows more emotional as her dogs, one by one, are taken away for adoption.  Oh, boy.  It's such a good girl.  These are the hard ones.  The puppies, huh?  The puppies are the hard ones.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're all part of my life.  I'm going to let them go. 
[00:54:00]  Puppies have to hate that house.  Yeah.  As the extraction of the dogs continues, casualties of the awful living conditions in the home begin to surface.  I wouldn't have seen under his chin if...  Oh, say, open wounds.  Mommy's sorry.  A booboo.  A booboo.  It's a fucking infection under its jaw.  Did he notice?  Her reply was, well, he was on the bottom cage, so I couldn't see it.  Yeah.  Stacey shouldn't have had him in that situation in the first place.  Probably.  This dog has staph infection, and it's kind of spread along the surface of the skin. 
[00:54:30]  He's going to need prolonged treatment.  Poor dog with staph infection just squashed it.  As the animals got younger and younger, their condition got worse and worse.  Hi, here, pumpkin.  That's typically what we find in these hoarding-type situations.  This is one of the ones that I'm more worried about.  You can't see because of the hair.  Okay.  If you run your hand down their back, you can actually feel the individual backbone.  Oh, that's good.  The ribs were so prominent, my fingers could actually slip in between them. 
[00:55:00]  That's great.  That's good.  What happened to that one, fatty?  That's one of the problems with so many.  You didn't miss a meal, did you?  No kidding.  You fucking twat.  Yeah, you can have seven puppies, and five of them do fine, but two don't.  She put down a big bowl of food and expected seven puppies to sort it out evenly, and that's  just not going to happen.  That's how she eats.  Exactly.  Did you know that that could happen to them, being all together in the same cage?  I've been watching for stuff.  They had a bath last week, and I...  You didn't see it.  I didn't see it.  That's a no.  Oh, shut up, you lying fuck. 
[00:55:30]  You're probably suffering.  The little tiny submissive puppy is going to be the one who's going to starve to death  in these situations.  He has pretty much no fat reserves left.  Yeah.  He would have been in dire straits for a week or so.  Really?  That's close to death?  Puppy?  Yes.  Did you realize that?  He's saving money for nothing.  I didn't realize he was that then.  Yeah, and fat pigs for free.  He wouldn't have made it much longer.  No.  This doctor I like, because you can tell this doctor hates Stacey.  Oh, can't stand her.  This doctor's a homely woman. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, enough of Roy, spelt R-O-I.  Yeah.  Who cares about Roy?  That's how gay guys spell boy, B-O-I.  Yes.  If I met that hoarder, I would go, that doctor, I'd go, you know, you're doing God's work,  but you are an ugly woman.  More dogs?  Yeah.  This is her son.  Oh, no, it's not.  Yeah, these are the workers bringing the...  Still bringing dogs.  Heartworks are transmitted by mosquitoes, and outdoor dogs that are not preventative have 
[00:56:30]  a 100% infection rate.  Wow.  It is impossible for them to not contract heartworms, and...  And these girls are in and out.  Oh, well, I didn't know.  Heartworms.  Are you talking or anything like that?  No.  Get tired easily or anything?  No, but I lost their sister.  So, what this is a test for is, it's testing for adult heartworms.  Oh, she didn't inject the blood into that woman.  One dog tested positive for heartworms and will die without treatment. 
[00:57:00]  There's a possibility that Mackie is also infected.  She wasn't able to provide even the basic preventative medicine.  Good job.  There were no vaccines.  There were no heartworm tests.  There was no heartworm prevention.  Just the treatment and the staging itself is...  She's a fucking pig.  Six to eight hundred bucks an animal.  Yeah.  Stacey can't afford the treatment necessary to save her dogs yet.  She's reluctant to give them up for a doctor.  Oh, really?  I'm not going to be able to take care of them because of, uh...  That's her son coddling her. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  He's going to have to...  Now here comes the cobbling.  Arm around her while Fatso cries.  What do you think?  Should we keep them?  What do you think?  Should we keep them?  She said that to her daughter.  Yeah.  How about you keep me, you fucking bitch?  Pause that.  Yeah, because the dog's going to die.  She can't afford the heartworm treatment.  What do you think?  Should we keep them?  Like, what a selfish pig.  That's it.  Maybe you can go out and work as a 14-year-old.  Why don't you turn some tricks and give me the money. 
[00:58:00]  And I could pay for the heartworm, and you could still not stay at my house.  That doctor I love.  I wish people in the listening audience could see the doctor.  Because she really is a goofy-looking dumb lady who fucking wants to smash this fat fucking  George Washington face with a fist.  Is she a doctor or one of these animal people?  Oh, I'm assuming she's a doctor.  She's like some kind of vet.  Yeah, I think she's a vet.  Yeah, because she's not going to listen to this fat pig.  Yeah, she likes the animal.  She doesn't like the fat lady hurting the animal.  Well, here's what the problem is. 
[00:58:30]  You can't deal with it.  I bet you if you sat her down, she goes, let's take out the old lady instead of the fucking  pets.  Yeah.  Let's save the pets and kill the old lady.  I say save the heartworms.  What about them?  Yeah, poor heartworms.  Poor worms.  These pet people will take out a human being to save a puppy.  Well, these fucking dogs were hoarding heartworms in their heart.  It is.  To clear that out.  It is.  To just, I guess, paraphrase Carlin, where he talks about the sanctity of life, how we are selective.  Yeah, yeah.  When you look at it, when you look at it in a base thing, why are heartworms?  Heartworms less valuable than dogs. 
[00:59:00]  Parasites.  And that fucking mosquito flew that heartworm into that dumb dog, and that fucking heartworm  is living off that fucking dog and enjoying it, and all of a sudden these buddinskis come  and wreck his vibe.  Imagine if you had a house in the Hamptons and someone just came and ripped you out of  it.  Yeah, Carlin was brilliant.  How do we know that heartworms aren't the most important living thing in the universe?  They love just zipping around, they don't take any other space up.  How do we know for sure? 
[00:59:30]  Right?  Maybe they're the secret to the universe.  Never know.  You never fucking know.  I don't think humans are the most important thing.  I don't believe that anymore.  No, you're dumb.  Just about all of us are just fucking wasting time doing nothing, really, to make the place  better.  Skipping around.  Yep.  Did anybody see Jeff Bridges yesterday?  I didn't come back.  He was here?  I slept, yeah, but it was at 3 o'clock.  He's got an album out.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he played a fucking country star in a movie, so now all of a sudden he's a musician. 
[01:00:00]  Ah, there you go.  Yeah.  All right.  Hit it.  I can't afford to do the heartworm stuff, and I'd have to keep them and then watch them  die.  Yeah.  But I can't.  Nice perm.  I hate fat ladies with perms and a lot of dogs.  I bet they lied about the heartworms.  Yeah, exactly.  Tell her the dogs have heartworms.  But Stacey reluctantly handing over her last two dogs, Dr. Norris and her team can now  focus on the cats.  Oh, boy.  God almighty. 
[01:00:30]  We had 13 cats crammed in a very small kitchen.  How many?  15.  They were on top of each other, and cats just don't like to be that way.  Oh, they got to seal off the kitchen so the cats can't get out.  Oh, that's what they're doing?  Now they're freaking.  Oh, the cats are not happy.  They know the jig's up.  Oh, yeah, you got to get a cat with a neck.  They hate that shit.  We had one cat with an eye infection that was pretty serious.  It's going to receive treatment.  Aw.  In general, they basically just look scruffy and unkempt. 
[01:01:00]  Those cats are not happy.  Oh, man.  That is an angry cat.  Oh, boy.  Can you pause this for a second?  These fucking vet people, they're some...  Vets are ballsy motherfuckers, man.  Let me see your eyes.  Fuck you.  Your cat's not doing well.  I ain't touching it.  That thing just wants to kill you.  That cat doesn't understand.  It's living in a squalor.  That cat, like, his ears were flattened. 
[01:01:30]  It looked like the cat was doing 100 miles an hour through a tunnel.  Let me look at your eye.  I'm here to help you.  Yeah, but I'm here to look...  I want to put my finger in your eye for a moment.  That tender eye.  I want to scrape away the pus.  Fucking cats don't even understand you're there to help them.  I had cats over the years and had cats over the years.  They're ungrateful fucks is what they are.  When you're trying to help them, they're just fucking trying to scratch you.  Nothing's good enough for a cat. 
[01:02:00]  Bite you.  I'm not a fan of cats like I am dogs.  Fuck cats.  Ungrateful fucks.  That's going to make me laugh all day.  That's hilarious.  And it's trying to help your little eyeball.  And you're trying to reason with the damn thing.  No, I'm trying to help you here.  They have to catch...  The dogs, they just fucking pick up the cats.  They're grabbing with nets like butterflies.  Because they're leaping from shitty counter to shitty counter.  Well, if you could read a dog's mind, it would just be like, okay, okay.  Yeah.  Okay, whatever. 
[01:02:30]  Okay, okay.  I'll lick your face.  You got me out of here.  All right, thank you.  Okay.  Thanks a million.  Thanks a million.  Okay.  And cats, Jimmy, what are cats?  If you could read their minds.  They're like, hi.  Hi, I just want to help you.  Get away.  Get away.  Get away.  Yeah, if you read a cat's mind, it would be, leave me the fuck alone.  But I only want to look.  I don't care.  Get away.  Get away.  Get away.  Get away.  Die.  Get away.  Fucking cats.  I love them. 
[01:03:00]  They're fucking miserable.  At any moment, they could rip your eye out.  Why would you live with something like that?  That cat was not happy.  No, that was an angry-ass cat.  Where the cat's head is round because the ears are so flat.  So far back, yeah.  Flat back on its head.  Fuck.  God, I think it's mad.  Dr. Norris finds Stacy wasting time trying to remove cats from one cage to another.  We're going to do it in a cold situation.  We really need to stop playing.  We need to get these animals out of here now. 
[01:03:30]  Okay?  Yeah, they're in 100-degree heat outside.  Bam, bam, bam, meow, meow.  With the dogs and cats now out of the house, Animal Control returns with some unexpected news.  Yeah, I'm with Animal Control.  Uh-oh.  She's clearly shown over the course of the last three years that she is unable to care for even one animal,  but we can't legally refuse to allow them to have animals. 
[01:04:00]  We would prefer that y'all not have any animals here on the premises,  but the city ordinance states that you can have five dogs and five cats on a premises.  Wait, wait, pause that.  How the fuck is that legal?  Especially for her.  She obviously can't take care of them.  What's wrong with the laws?  Just say no, you can't.  Like, do a case-by-case basis.  She cannot.  When you sit down and go, well, obviously, all the, you know, sick dogs and cats we just pulled out of your house,  then, no, you're not allowed to ever do this again. 
[01:04:30]  If you do it, we're going to throw you in the county jail.  That's Louisiana, though, man.  How is that fucking legal?  That's really bothersome.  Five in each.  And now they're all hugging because they're happy that she's going to be able to get more animals.  Yeah, and you know she won't get them spayed or neutered, so she'll just get it.  She's probably got 50 dogs again.  Holy shit.  I didn't know that shit was on.  A load of shit.  The roaches in that fucking shithouse.  The whole house is in thing.  When they're running around with a camera crew there, you know how bad that is at night?  Yeah. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God.  And they're hugging, but what about the daughter?  Again, she's happy she could have more animals, but the daughter still can't live in that house.  I think weird shit when I see this.  Like, you think that lady has a clean pussy?  Dude, that's a fucking absolutely cool thing to think.  You're right.  It is a disgusting mess.  Yeah, it's awful.  Just matted.  Oh, matted.  You know she'd probably let the dogs lick it.  She's probably taking nervous shits all day in her dirty toilet.  Not wiping properly?  No, not at all. 
[01:05:30]  She's got shit on the back of her right thumb.  She swipes too quickly because she wants to go out and pet a dog before they take it.  Right.  I think they're going to take the dogs while she's shitting.  I think it's under her nails.  Yeah, of course it is.  Don't want to shake her hand.  All right, let's hit this again.  This doesn't make sense.  Her having ten animals is too much.  So, Taylor, what do you think?  I think she can handle it.  You know, there's a lot of work ahead, you know, but I'm certain that she can do it.  Okay, no.  And we pause again because there's the coddling once the fucking day. 
[01:06:00]  I'm certain she can do it.  How are you certain she can't do it?  Yeah, how about no?  How about she can have one dog, one cat, and she spays and neuters?  That's it.  You know what?  That's the mistakes I made growing up.  As a kid, you would go, Mom, no.  You're so happy they're doing something.  Yeah, you can't do this.  Why would they fucking coddle her?  Ten animals.  Ten.  She can handle ten animals?  She can't.  She can't handle one daughter.  Stop it.  Oh, my God.  And that's her son, too? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So he's old enough to be on his own?  Yeah, of course.  But he lives over there.  He moved back into health fair.  Yeah.  Stupid asshole.  I didn't even see the end of this one, so I have no idea what the fuck happens.  Hopefully the mom goes off.  Hopefully the mom goes off.  Yeah, big fire.  I'll be coming back and checking on the welfare of the animals.  Now it becomes an intentional cruelty charge if they're not properly taken care of.  Nice.  Ten is your maximum legal limit.  The question is if you have two children, one of which is a teenager, and their needs 
[01:07:00]  may not be ten.  It may be less than ten.  But animal control sounds like they're going to keep an eye on you.  It'll be a lot easier with the ones that I have.  It really will.  She's not capable or able to care for ten animals at this point.  Oh, that doctor fucking hates her guts.  Yep.  That was the doctor who just said she's not capable of it.  Yep.  And that doctor wants to wring her fucking face.  Oh, stupid Roy again.  Get rid of Roy.  Oh, Roy.  Roy and his dumb ass.  Nothing, Roy.  I hate Roy.  I hope Roy's fucking suffering.  Dumb blacks. 
[01:07:30]  He's made others suffer.  Oh, Roy again.  Shame on Roy's hat.  Because they want the big ending with the fat pig station.  The house is dilapidated.  There are holes in the walls.  Oh.  It doesn't look good.  There's just grime everywhere.  Cat shit all over the cell.  They don't even want to sit or touch a wall.  They're scraping shit off the screens with shovels.  It's that high up. 
[01:08:00]  Wow.  There's not one redeemable thing.  With many of the items now out of the house, Dorothy calls a family meeting in the kitchen.  Here's the main man.  Been in here, Janice?  No, I have not been in here.  What does this room say to you, Janice?  That's the mother.  The older mother.  Run like hell.  I thought I had prepared myself for really bad.  Yeah, you raised a winner there.  Wow, look at that.  Really bad doesn't even begin to cover it.  We're in here with super power masks, full suits, gloves, glasses, because it's that dangerous in here. 
[01:08:30]  This girl can be very sick.  Did you almost yell at her finally?  Family members can be very sick.  That's why she wasn't here.  Oh, good.  That's a good solution.  Do you ever get upset with your mom?  Always.  Have you ever yelled at her?  Yes.  I mean, this is the fact of the matter, right?  They're looking at a cat box.  This is in the kitchen.  Cake shit.  On the stove.  It had to be on the stove. 
[01:09:00]  On the stove.  What a pig.  She is totally fine about it.  Did anybody know, do you think, really knew what you were going through in here?  Nope.  The kids they're talking to me.  The son and the daughter.  Living in that environment is very overwhelming and very stressful.  It's hilarious.  Could you please tell your mom what this has done?  Inside of you to live this way.  Time for the mom to go, la, la, la, la, la, I don't hear you. 
[01:09:30]  She's holding back.  She is.  I'm sorry.  But I want her to say one thing about that it did hurt her life.  It did hurt.  It hurt a lot.  She's just racist, too.  She's just hungry.  Man, the mother's just feeling nothing.  It breaks my heart that Taylor was nothing.  The grandmother's fine.  I want to survive in this.  What did you want more than anything? 
[01:10:00]  I need a home.  But more than anything, I need a mom.  Dog, dog, cat, cat, cat, cat, cat, cat, cat, cat.  That's exactly what she's thinking.  That's exactly.  Spilling her guts.  Dog, dog, cat, cat.  When can I get more dogs?  More cats, cats, cats.  Me, dog, cat, dog.  Me, cat, dog, cat.  Me, me, dog, cat.  Me, dog, cat, dog, me.  You're absolutely right.  That is it.  It had to be on the stove.  What the hell?  Right.  Yeah.  This was in the kitchen on the stove?  Well, the cat box had to be on the stove.  Oh, of course it does. 
[01:10:30]  Of course.  She's just sitting there going, can we get this over with?  Because they told me I could have five dogs.  They told me I could have ten animals, and I want to get them in here right away.  Immediately.  Do you know how many roaches in there are so ingrained?  You'll never de-roach that place.  You have to burn that house down, and then just plow it asunder and build something new.  Oh, my God.  Can I?  Wow.  Very good.  Johnny Romeo on Twitter.  I just checked my Twitter for the first time today.  It says, that's like telling a pedo.  Remember the five dogs, five cats thing? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's like telling a pedo, we don't want you to have kids here, but City Ordnance says you  can have five boys and five girls.  It's the same thing, though.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Why is that legal?  Why is that legal?  Well, you know, you've got to be understanding.  You've proven you can't be around these things.  You're Johnson's baby shampoo.  Mom, who seemed to care more about the animals than her children.  Out we go.  Yeah.  I'm really worried for Taylor.  The state of the house is sad. 
[01:11:30]  She's still going to come home to a place that's got roaches that smells ferociously bad.  This house is just not a safe house.  Well, then why doesn't the daughter stay somewhere else?  Yeah.  This mother's son.  After the cleanup comes to a close, the workers make a grisly discovery.  Oh, boy.  I never found her.  I thought she might have been in the pantry or something.  In the pantry?  I really hoped that she'd gotten out of the house.  This is not protecting what you love. 
[01:12:00]  A dead cat?  You're keeping too many animals.  The arms around her.  If you take care of too much, animals die.  Children go without a home, a real home.  Do you need 10 animals to be who you are?  Let's see.  Is it dead, buck-toothed cat or dog?  The truth is that she should not have animals.  I want you to get well.  And you're not well.  That fucking fat, sociopathic face. 
[01:12:30]  We could only push her as far as we could push her.  Now the credits are rolling.  She knew she could keep 10 animals.  I'm thankful that Stacey wasn't allowed more.  What?  If ordinance had said 15, she'd have probably wanted to keep 15.  So she did keep 10.  Only when Stacey really understands that she can create safety and meaning in a real way,  a healthy way, will she be able to see how absolutely absurd this was to hold on to all 
[01:13:00]  this stuff and all these animals.  What a disaster.  What happened?  Let's see.  Do they do what happened?  Stacey's working with an aftercare organizer and seeing a therapist.  All right.  27 dogs and 13 cats went to no-kill shelters for adoption.  Nine additional animals were returned to state.  Put that back to them.  Nine additional animals.  So she got nine animals back.  Nine.  How is that?  They had no-kill shelters, I like, though.  That should not be allowed. 
[01:13:30]  Okay.  Let's see.  Nine.  We're just getting the update on fucking fat slob.  That's good.  And all these animals.  Being cobbled.  Oh, the sun sucks, too.  That's where she's seeing a therapist.  Right there, Sam.  Oh, sorry.  27 dogs and 13 cats went to the no-kill shelters.  Nine additional animals were returned to fat pig, and animal control is monitoring the situation.  So she kept nine.  That's self-disgusting.  Holy shit. 
[01:14:00]  And she probably...  Ah, enough with Roy.  Boom!  Give a shit about Roy.  Dumb Roy.  And you know what?  She probably looks at it like, look, I only took nine.  I was allowed ten.  Well, I only took nine, so I'm doing the right thing.  Robert, very mad with us.  Robert in Chicago.  Sorry, we're playing TV on the radio, Robert.  Robert?  I can't believe you guys, man.  I'm appalled.  These people are sick.  I wish y'all would take some of that money that y'all make and grow a thing called a heart. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, some of that money we all make.  Are you kidding, Robert?  He's kidding.  You're right.  Are you kidding?  I'm not kidding.  I watch these shows all the time.  It's a funny thing to me.  Their sickness is always suddenly cured after they get the goddamn house cleaned up.  A bunch of lazy-ass bitches.  Yeah, they are hateable, aren't they?  You rock it hard.  Hey, guys, call Dr. Francois.  Robert, you roll.  Yes.  I was like, thank God.  For a second he had me. 
[01:15:00]  I'm like, please don't let this guy live.  I'm sure there's a few listening in right now that are like that for real, but I don't  have patience for the expression, don't you know they're sick?  It's hard when you see it in this intense 30-minute focus.  It's hard for anybody to look at this and not go, she should have her fucking teeth just  kicked out by a mule.  Just smack her in the face.  It's almost undeniably piggish.  Put her in a cage.  Put her in one of those cages and make her sit there.  A gilded cage, man! 
[01:15:30]  Make her get those sores like the dogs had an old weepy eye.  Yeesh.  Yeah, I mean, they pulled a dead carcass out of there.  Yeah.  Maybe more.  I don't know.  That should be enough for Animal Control to say, this woman can't have pets.  You know what?  She will fuck up, and Animal Control will come by and say, we're taking your shit.  Imagine if they cleaned up a hoarder's house and all of a sudden there was a dead kid under  all the garbage.  You think they would allow that person to live in that house? 
[01:16:00]  To get your other kids back.  I'm all skeeved out, and I feel like this roach is crawling over my sweet boy's body.  I know, and now we've got to eat after that.  I ate eggs watching that.  Cold eggs.  Oh, Jesus.  Cold clammy eggs.  You've got to pet the dogs.  I'm hungry after that.  Yeah, we've got a busy show.  Bob Kelly's coming back because Penn Jillette took up all his time yesterday.  How great was Penn yesterday? 
[01:16:30]  Phenomenal.  Then I watched that Johnny Carson clip again.  Oh, my God.  I did too when I got home.  That Amazing Randy thing.  I'd love to have the Amazing Randy on.  He's still alive, right?  He's old, right?  Yeah.  Amazing Randy's pretty fucking amazing.  He's an intense guy.  Paul E.D.'s coming in today.  What time is the year?  You guys don't watch Jersey Shore, though, huh?  I know.  I know who he is.  Mm-mm.  I like the Jersey Shore.  Yeah, I know who he is.  I really do like the Jersey Shore.  Yeah?  Yeah, I like watching.  And then Joel McHale's coming in, too.  Do we have to talk about the rom-com he's in? 
[01:17:00]  We don't have to talk about that?  Spy Kids 4, right?  Yeah.  That's fucking huge for Mr. McHale.  All right.  The more you hear this phrase, sanctity of life, you've heard that, sanctity of life.  You believe in it?  Personally, I think it's a bunch of shit.  Well, I mean, life is sacred?  Who said so?  God?  Hey, if you read history, you realize that God is one of the leading causes of death.  Has been for thousands of years. 
[01:17:30]  Hindus, Muslims, Jews, Christians, all taking turns killing each other because God told them it was a good idea.  The sword of God, the blood of the Lamb, vengeance is mine.  Millions of dead motherfuckers.  Millions of dead motherfuckers, all because they gave the wrong answer to the God question.  You believe in God?  No.  Boom.  Dead.  You believe in God?  Yes.  You believe in my God?  No.  Boom.  Dead.  My God has a bigger dick than your God. 
[01:18:00]  Thousands of years.  Thousands of years.  And all the best wars, too.  The bloodiest, most brutal wars fought, all based on religious hatred.  Which is fine with me, eh?  Anytime a bunch of holy people want to kill each other, I'm a happy guy.  But don't be giving me all this shit about the sanctity of life.  I mean, even if there were such a thing, I don't think it's something you can blame on God. 
[01:18:30]  Now, you know where the sanctity of life came from?  We made it up.  You know why?  Because we're alive.  Self-interest.  Living people have a strong interest in promoting the idea that somehow life is sacred.  You don't see Abbott and Costello running around talking about this shit, do you?  We're not hearing a whole lot from Mussolini on the subject.  What's the latest from JFK?  Not a goddamn thing.  Because JFK, Mussolini, and Abbott and Costello are fucking dead. 
[01:19:00]  They're fucking dead.  And dead people give less than a shit about the sanctity of life.  Only living people care about it.  So the whole thing grows out of a completely biased point of view.  It's a self-serving, man-made bullshit story.  It's one of these things we tell ourselves so we'll feel noble.  Life is sacred.  Makes you feel noble.  But let me ask you this.  If everything that ever lived is dead, and everything alive is going to die,  where does the sacred part come in? 
[01:19:30]  I'm having trouble with that.  Because, I mean, even with the stuff we preach about the sanctity of life,  we don't practice it.  We don't practice it.  Look at what we kill.  Mosquitoes and flies?  Because they're pests.  Lions and tigers?  Because it's fun.  Chickens and pigs?  Because we're hungry.  Pheasants and quails?  Because it's fun.  And we're hungry.  And people?  We kill people.  Because they're pests. 
[01:20:00]  And it's fun.  And you might have noticed something else.  The sanctity of life doesn't seem to apply to cancer cells, does it?  You rarely see a bumper sticker that says,  Save the Tumors.  Or I break for advanced melanoma.  Ah, viruses, mold, mildew, maggots, fungus, weeds, E. coli, bacteria, the crabs. 
[01:20:30]  Nothing sacred about those things.  So at best, the sanctity of life is kind of a selective thing.  We get to choose which forms of life we feel are sacred,  and we get to kill the rest.  Pretty neat deal, huh?  You know how we got it?  We made the whole fucking thing up.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  Are you lonesome tonight?  Do you miss me tonight? 
[01:21:00]  Are you sorry we drifted apart?  Does your memory stray to a brighter summer day  When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?  Do the chairs in your boiler seem empty and bare? 
[01:21:30]  Do you gaze at your bald head  And wish you had hair?  A drop filled with pain  Shall I come back?  Tell me, dear  Are you lonesome?  Oh, Lord, Lord  I wonder how 
[01:22:00]  You know, someone said  The world's a stage  And each must play a part  Oh, God  Oh, God  Oh, man, I'll tell you  Oh, Lord 
[01:22:30]  And I had no calls to die  And I had no calls to die  Oh, my God  Sing it, baby  Shall I come back again?  Tell me, dear  Are you lonesome? 
[01:23:00]  Is your heart  Filled with pain?  Shall I come back again?  Tell me, dear  Are you lonesome?  Do not  Ah, yes  Somewhere  Steven S. from Bayshore  Smiling  Laughing Elvis  What was it?

You would imagine 
[01:25:30]  But it will be  Again  Radio  Where?  Graceland  What loser  Is going to stand  In front of Graceland  34 years later  With a candle?  Jimmy you're missing  Some good stuff man  We just learned that  In honor of Elvis Presley's  Death right  34 years ago today  The Elvis Presley  What is it called?  The Elvis Presley channel?  It's Elvis Radio  Elvis Radio  Sirius 19  They're going to be  Broadcasting for 3 hours  In front of Graceland  Because they're doing  A candlelight Vigil  Look at Jimmy's face  Can you fucking believe that? 
[01:26:00]  And you should also explain  That when they're not  Broadcasting  This year's  Candlelight Vigil  They will be broadcasting  The 2008, 2009  And 2010  Candlelight Vigils  Oh just in case  What was different  What kind of candles  Do they use in 2008  That they're not using  In 2011  Yeah and even  You'd think the song selection  Would be comparable  Each year  Probably  I don't know if there's  Any new hits  That have  I bet you couldn't tell  One year from another  No  What candle would you bring  To a candlelight vigil?  Would you bring something  That has a nice scent? 
[01:26:30]  No  I don't like those  Other dumb  Little candles  That they put on  On a  They put a  Styrofoam cup around it  To keep the wind  From blowing it  How about enough  With the vigils?  He's been dead  Since 77  Right  How about enough?  And I like Elvis a lot  How about you get over it?  Cut the shit  Hey  Excuse my French  Who owns Graceland  With you  Lisa Marie  Or whoever the mother is 
[01:27:00]  Lisa Marie  Does she?  God if there was  An Elvis in my family  And they moved on  I'd sell that shit  To Home Depot  Yeah  I would just sell  The property  And make everyone  Really mad  That it's outside  With their dumb candles  Oh they would  They would freak out  Just going with  Jimmy's logic  Look  34 years is enough  We're selling  The god damn place  Okay  Yeah  I hope in a Home Depot  Or something takes it  To a Carvel  Something  Something obnoxious  Yeah or a Dairy Queen 
[01:27:30]  Or something  Maybe a Carvel  Maybe the first  Spencer's gift  That's not in a mall  A giant Spencer's gift  A giant one  Rubber dog shit  How mad  Elvis' house  How mad would people get  Oh would they be angry  They would be outraged  Hot under the collar  Oh boy  So we'd like to keep track  Of where  Sam's money's going  Yeah  See the company  Could so do the right thing  At any moment  And give Sam  And a lot of other people  Here a raise 
[01:28:00]  Yeah  That's serious  XM satellite radio  Of course  Today we noticed  That your raise  Is being used  For a much better cause  Sam  Well I don't know  If  Instead of you  Getting a raise  They've decided  To push all that money  So they can have  A gay wedding  Live on the radio today  Well I think  It's a good idea  To have a gay wedding  On the radio  And I don't know  If the funds  Are being allocated  From the same  But you just do  The numbers  The money they're  Spending on the gay wedding  Could certainly be  Your raise sir  Yeah  But they have decided  That the gay wedding 
[01:28:30]  Needs to happen  And that your raise  Could wait  They should help  This homosexual  As opposed to  Helping homosexuals  Who don't work here  Yeah  And the heterosexuals  The homosexuals  Do  At least one of the  Homosexuals  Works here  Oh who's getting married  Frank DiCaro  Who's Frank DiCaro  Frank DiCaro  Is getting married  Who's Frank DiCaro  We've had him on  Pop is  Picture up  You'll know who that is  He used to be on  The Daily Show  He's the bald guy  With the glasses  We've had him on  A couple times over years  He does a show on OutQ  He's alright  I guess he's gay  But I don't know who he is  I'm sure I'll know his face  He's getting married  Yeah he's getting married 
[01:29:00]  To a man today  On the radio  That's him  I don't know  You've seen him  Maybe I have  He's alright  He's fine  He's very bald  Very effeminate  When he talks  Does he?  Yeah  This morning at 11  On OutQ  He's getting married  I think it's a joyous occasion  So  We've had weddings  On this channel  What?  Listen to me Sam  We're talking about your raise  Stop  Stop right now  So tell us about  The gay wedding  And just do the numbers 
[01:29:30]  In your head  Knowing that all that money  Could have been your raise  Well I looked down  I went down to the fishbowl  The fishbowl is where it's happening  They're inviting a bunch of people  A bunch of fans I guess  Must have entered a contest  Or something  I don't know  Because there's lots of chairs lined up  Are they going to be touching stuff?  Yeah I know  Believe me  Every single joke  Is going through my head  It just seemed too easy  All the chairs were upside down  In the lobby  That old jag  And they all have nice white cushions on them 
[01:30:00]  Because it's a wedding  Locked me white  After they're done  The piano's been brought in  Ah  A what?  As opposed to the organ  Piano  Uh huh  A piano player  A piano player  Yeah  Who's going to push in his stool  Well you've got to push in  The guy's stool  Yeah  So he can get closer to the piano  Yeah  Fuck Sam  What's wrong with you?  I don't know  I'm assuming he'll push his own stool  Do you think that he plays the piano  Because he sucks on the organ?  It's an old joke  Oh Jim  A terrible old joke 
[01:30:30]  I like the tulips on the organ  Oh yeah  That's another one  What was the joke  Had that one go  Something about the tulips on the organ  I forget  What's better than a rose on your piano  Tulips on your organ  Tulips on your organ  My friend Dean Miller told me that joke  Good old Dean  I feel like I know him  Yeah he's dead  He's dead  I guess I will never know him  No  But you know  And then they have a little altar set up  And you know  They'll have somebody in here  Obviously to conduct the wedding  I don't know who  That's all the features  But you know  Get down to the money  What are they spending your raise on today Sam  Well again 
[01:31:00]  I think that  They allocated the funds  From a different resource  But  I don't know how much money  Frank DiCaro's wedding cost  I'd imagine it's a healthy amount  I would imagine  They're spending at least  10,000 today  And that would be a nice raise  Wow  I would accept it  10 G's  Are they spending that much?  I would imagine  I haven't looked in there  I would imagine  Is there any decorations?  Wedding like decor?  Not yet  But I see decorations laid out on the chairs  I want some cake 
[01:31:30]  Oh  Decorations on the chairs  Yeah  Exactly  It also looks like the logo on the fucking  On Howard's  On Howard's studio  On Howard's store  Decorations  Walk to that door and think that's where they're going  No, no, no, not there  Not there  No, no, no, no  They were white cloth  Huh?  They were white cloth decorations  Uh-huh  There'll be plenty of guests  Lisa Lampanelli  Simon Doonan  Simon Doonan?  Yeah  And they'll be taking calls from you 
[01:32:00]  Do their virtual bridesmaids  What?  Who is you?  That's the audience?  The audience  They met us  Maybe  Well, you'll be calling in, I'm sure  Alright, so  There you go  Gay wedding today  Instead of you getting a raise  Well, I think it's important  I like keeping track of this  But tomorrow you will be asking for a raise, right?  I mean, we'll see what tomorrow brings  I'm not a psychic  And once again  Sam's totally not in on this bit  It's me, Ant and Jen  I think I've made that abundantly clear today  Really?  Because they  They've basically told us that this  Can make you look bad 
[01:32:30]  Well, yeah  I mean, I could understand  So you have nothing to do with this  Like when we're in commercial  He's like  Dude, keep it up  The pressure's getting to him  I think if you guys keep it up  It keeps me in the clear  I wasn't even in the room  Yeah  During the commercial break  Long Ireland  Long Ireland beer  Wow, that's tough to say  Long Ireland beer on Twitter  Says they should open a CVS  At Graceland  How great would that be?  Yeah, that would be  24 hours  There's gotta be one asshole  In that family  That has some kind of power 
[01:33:00]  That could sell Graceland  Just tear it down to the ground  Yes  And open up a franchise store  CVS would be so insulting  We'll make it a Bobby Darin tribute house  Somebody else  What are you doing?  Maybe, yeah  Okay  Speaking of the geese  Adam Carolla's in trouble for a podcast  This is where we're at today  This is not good  It's funny  When you do radio  You always have this dream  That you get complete freedom 
[01:33:30]  Total freedom  We've seen it over the years  Where you work for one stuffy radio station  And move on to the next radio station  Where the guy's like  No man, we want you guys  To just be yourselves  So you take the job  And then you learn  That that's all bullshit  They start, you know  Tightening the screws  So then you move on  To another place  And then all of a sudden  Satellite radio comes around  And you're like  Fuck, finally  Total freedom  Total freedom  Uncensored  It's gonna be great  But then you move over to there  And they start tightening the screws 
[01:34:00]  And then you learn  Wow, not much freedom here  I think I had more freedom  On regular radio  You realize some people have  Gotten in there  And said some things  Some groups  Interest groups  And they cave  Yeah  I don't care about cursing  I want some of our old bits back  Yeah, fuck the cursing  Because people will go  You have freedom  You get to curse and stuff  Who cares  It's not the cursing  I'll get  I would give them the cursing back  If we have a few of our bits back  No cursing back  No, no  I can never go back  To euphemisms again  No, I don't like that 
[01:34:30]  But you know what  I would sacrifice that  To get some of the shit in  In here again  With the girls and stuff  To be able to do some shit  Yeah  I would definitely sacrifice that  Not even that  Not have to tiptoe so much  About just humorous  Things about race  And sexual orientation  And stuff like that  You know  I'm not trying to turn this  Into a bitch session  I'm just giving you  The history of radio  So then  So then with satellite radio  They tighten the screws  And you realize  Wow, you don't have  That much freedom 
[01:35:00]  You have some freedom  Sure  Yeah  A lot of people are moving  Into this podcast world  Yeah  And we're taking a look  And a peek ourselves  Right?  Of course  And Adam Carolla  Seems to be  The person people look at  As far as podcasting goes  And he's been very successful  And he's starting to make  A little money at it  And stuff  Well guess what?  Now he has to apologize  For something he said  On a podcast  That's where we're at  This makes no sense whatsoever  Not the most sincere apology  I don't think though  I know  I think he's the type of guy  That he's like us  Like a fuck  Yeah 
[01:35:30]  Fake apology time  You know  What?  Oh god  I think we got  That's the podcast  This is what he said  This is the  Let's see how evil  And horrid this is  Oh that  That group GLAD  Is it GLAD?  They are the  The opposite of funny  And fun  Not very GLAD  Most of the time  No they're not GLAD  Ungrateful  They should call their organization  Ungrateful  Yeah  Adam Carolla apologized to GLAD 
[01:36:00]  For this  Well see the petition reads  In this horrific age  Of LGBT  Lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, gender  When did  When did everybody get  Fucking lumped in  With the gays?  You know what I mean?  What the  Really  How much  What percentage  Is transgendered?  You know what I mean?  Like let's just say  I was a politician  And I was like  Hey transgendered folks  I don't need your vote  I don't think I could get elected?  What do they make up?  30% of the population? 
[01:36:30]  Sure  I went to school  With a bunch of transgendered guys  And now I work with a bunch of them  Like what the fuck?  When did we start giving a shit  About these people?  Yeah  I don't know  I don't know one  We gotta work it out  With the  You know  And now there's all these  Variations  Where it's like  I'm a pre-op  Transgender  Trans-neutral  Trans-fat  Shut the fuck up  Bravo  I love it  It's good  What's wrong with that?  Glad can be upset  That's fine  But  That's it 
[01:37:00]  That's all they can be  Is upset  There's nothing wrong with that  They really are  The biggest bunch of fucking babies  They are babies  They are babies  Crow's entertaining  His audience  He's  He's absolutely being funny  With the whole thing  That was funny  And it is  Sorry  It's like what he was saying  Is  He's a comedian  True  Not a politician  He's expressing frustration  And  And it is  A funny thing to talk about  It's like  There are so many people now  Lumped in  Under the gay umbrella 
[01:37:30]  That it  It gets ridiculous  Right  And then  It continued  I want an apology  From all the Asians  And all the  Transgendered  Aoki  And the  And the  What was it  The gay  The lesbian  What is it again  Lesbian  Gay  Bisexual  Transgender  I don't know why  They put it in that order  Because that's not alphabetical  Right  It makes no sense  They must think it rolls off the tongue  Shouldn't it be something that  Spells something like 
[01:38:00]  Yuck  Or something  You know what I mean  Very good  That's some good material right there  But again  That is something  He's being sarcastic  And a little shitty about it  And that's what  Adam's humor is  Yeah  That's what his fucking humor is  And fucking glad  Glad has never come out and said  We didn't  Hey look  That's not our style  But hey  He should be able to say  Whatever he wants  Yeah  These motherfuckers  Like every other special interest group  Never  Ever  Ever  Come out and defend  People's right  To say shit 
[01:38:30]  They don't like  Oh no  We think you have the right  But we're still gonna  Fucking backdoor  Target your advertisers  Fuck them  Yeah  How about  How about  I'm offended  By things they say  And do  And are free  To broadcast  But I want them  Removed from the airwaves  Because what they say  And their lifestyle  Offends me so much  That I need them  Taken off the air  But it's amazing  Like as ignorant  Being offended  By their lifestyle 
[01:39:00]  Yes  It's just as ignorant  Being offended  By jokes about their lifestyle  They're the ones going  I can't believe  You're not allowed  To be offended  By my lifestyle  They actually say  You're not allowed  To be offended  By their lifestyle  They are people  They are just trying  To live their lives  They are gay  They are lesbian  They are transgender  Whatever  Yet they will try  To shut down  Anyone  That says anything  Adverse about them  Even in jest  Yeah  It's  Hypocritical  It's self-important 
[01:39:30]  Drivel  They're just babies  And it's  It's  Of all the groups  GLAD's a very powerful one  And I think  On Red Eye  They've made fun  Of gay people  And a lot of times  Gottfeld has invited  People from GLAD  To come on  And they won't come on  They have their own show  Brown Eye  I got it  I know  It's cute  But they won't  They won't come on  And argue  No  They want to just  Release press statements  And be in a perfectly  Controlled environment  Yes  Like when they had Tracy  In that press conference  They want it to be 
[01:40:00]  Their backdrop  Their setting  Their situation  Gay people  Who I think  Legitimately  Wanted to be treated  A certain way  Have just turned  Into the same  Fucking self-righteous  Easily offended  Babies  That every other  Special interest group  If you want to  Gather the troops  Together  And have a march  Or a speech  Or a statement  About somebody  Beating the shit  Out of gay people  That's one thing  I'm all for that  Whatever you want to do 
[01:40:30]  Great  But when you  Take the same  Power  That you have  As a group  And put it  Toward that  Which is a good thing  And put it  Toward something  Like humor  And something  Adam Carolla says  And jokes  And that  You can't  You can't put those  In the same category  What people  Groups are doing  And they know  They're full of shit  By doing this  I know deep down  They know it  Is they're taking  Things that they know  Are said in humor 
[01:41:00]  That they just  Don't like  And they're putting  That parasitic  Fucking hate speech  Phrase on it  Right  Because that gets  A reaction  Out of companies  Whoa we can't  Tolerate hate speech  Even though they  Know deep down  Carolla's not hateful  He's just being  An asshole  And he's just being  Sarcastic  They know that  It's entertaining  He's gotta entertain people  A gay subject  Came up  And he's talking  About it  In a fun  Entertaining way  What's he supposed  To do  Fucking read  Your goddamn  Flyers on the air 
[01:41:30]  The second a goddamn  Gay topic  Comes up  Tow your company  Line  And all  The propaganda  You fucking  Shove out there  No he's  He's himself  He's making jokes  He's got an  Absolute right  To do it  And to try  To hurt his  Career  And force these  Fucking apologies  And bringing  Tracy Morgan  Back to  The fucking  1700 slavery days  Where they held  That poor bastard  Captive 
[01:42:00]  Jesus Christ  Enough of you  Motherfuckers  Had it  With that  Adam told TMZ  I'm sorry  My comments were  Hurtful  I'm a comedian  Not a politician  It was half-hearted  Yeah  So  He understands  That this shit  Could blow out  Of fucking proportion  So  But  See here's the deal  Who's  Who did they  Complain to  If he's doing  A podcast  Who did they  Complain to  And  Advertisers  That are potentially  Going to be with him 
[01:42:30]  If he  He might have  Them already  He might have  Them already  TMZ  They're a bunch  Of assholes too  The homophobic  Rant  Oh stop  It wasn't a  Homophobic rant  I understand what  Humor is TMZ  You cunts  Well TMZ's got  Fucking  What's his name  There in charge  Yeah of course  He sips on that  Straw every day  But you know  What he really  Wants to be  Fucking sipping on  Oh wow  Crazy straw  And that's fine  That's what he  Wants to do  Trust me  It's fine  Whatever  I'm just  Fucking  But he should  Understand humor  That's not a 
[01:43:00]  Homophobic rant  That's far from it  That's a guy  Trying to be funny  With some edgy material  Here we go  The gay and lesbian  Alliance against defamation  Is reaching out  To its allies  In the entertainment  Industry  To pull him  From the air  Telling TMZ  This gross intolerance  That Adam tries  To pass off as comedy  Should not have a place  On our airwaves  On our airwaves  It's a podcast  It's a podcast  You idiots  You stupid fucks  From GLAAD  The internet isn't yours  You fucking assholes  Not yet anyway 
[01:43:30]  I'm sure we're heading  That way eventually  Oh god  I'm disgusted  They just use the words  Like our airwaves  Airwaves  A podcast is not going out  Over the airwaves  It's being downloaded  You dumbbells  Yeah  Stop using 1950s phraseology  Yes  It's not what it is  It's not the public airwaves  They're not your airwaves  It's a requested  Downloaded piece of material  I bet this dumb fuck  That wrote that  Thought he was still on  Regular standard  Fucking radio 
[01:44:00]  And showed that  I bet that dumb fuck  Sure  That wrote that statement  Thinks the Adam Carolla show  Is on a station  That broadcasts over the air  And had no clue  It's on a podcast  And isn't comedy  You gotta ask Jimmy this  You know  You talk about stuff  That makes you feel  Uncomfortable right  And then you kind of  Make it funny  I mean that's a part  Of comedy anyway  I told you I heard  A phrase so well  By a guy who  A guy who was driving me  To the tonight show  I think he's Australian  And we were just  Talking about comedy  And what's wrong  With people apologizing  And I forget what  Was in the news 
[01:44:30]  That week  And he said it  He goes it's supposed  To be like  In society when there's  A knot  It's like in your back  You don't avoid it  During a massage  You take your knuckle  And you dig it  Into the knot  And he goes that's  What comedians  Are supposed to do  With these things  In society  And it was such  A great way to phrase it  Because that is  Kind of what we should do  And I don't mean  Be purposely insightful  Or insincerely insightful  But I think if there's  Something that's really  A tender spot  For the country  Don't fucking avoid it  Right 
[01:45:00]  You should make fun of it  Of course  That to me is your job  Is to make fun of it  I ask you that  Because my line  With this whole thing  Is when I see a guy  Dressed as a woman  It makes me very  Uncomfortable  You had me  Until you said  Uncomfortable  But that's where  My line is  I don't understand it  And I don't feel like  I have to understand it  And you know  We do the type of show  Of course we want  To make fun of that  And make some  Fucking jokes  And it's like  Anything else  There are some guys  That can pull it off  And you look and go like  Alright look 
[01:45:30]  That guy decided  He wants to  Look like a chick  And he's pulling it off  I still know it's a guy  But then  You're speaking my language  But you can't help  But laugh your fucking ass off  When you see a guy  That I would normally  Have seen on a job site  Right  As a fucking steam fitter  Pops a wig on  Right  And a skirt  Right  And puts makeup on  And starts like  Strutting around  It makes me laugh 
[01:46:00]  I'm not being intolerant  I'm not saying  He should be beaten  I'm not saying  He shouldn't live his life  The way he wants to live it  But I'm gonna laugh  My fucking ass off  Cause he looks ridiculous  I should still have  The right to laugh at it  Yes  Yes  Cause things that aren't sexually  I'm not gonna harm  The guy physically  Or anything  But yeah  I'm gonna chuckle and laugh  And then because we're  Lucky enough to have  A radio show  We're gonna bring it  To everyone's attention  And kind of goof on  And make jokes  And I'm not even gonna say that  Oh man that guy  Should have the shit beat  Out of him  No of course not  But I am gonna say 
[01:46:30]  He looks silly  He looks ridiculous  And things that are  Not sexually oriented  Like a guy in a toupee  That you don't think  Looks right on  Right  You laugh at  A guy who always wears  A suit jacket  That isn't right for him  Or he's wearing a white  Suit jacket all the time  Yes  And an open shirt  You laugh at  It's like  It's one more thing  That if it makes you  Uncomfortable  If you don't like  The way it looks  You should be able  To laugh at  And make fun of it  And the fact that  They say you shouldn't  Is irritating  And ahole cop on Twitter  He goes  Shame on Adam Carolla  For apologizing 
[01:47:00]  I've changed the corner  On this thing by the way  We used to be like  Just don't apologize  But unfortunately  You have no fucking choice  Snowballs  If you wanna continue  Doing what you love doing  In his case  He loves podcasting  Right  Unfortunately  I don't agree with that anymore  I understand when these guys  Do apologize  But I love the fact that  You can hear that  It's half-hearted  Give the insincere apology  It's a fake apology  All that shit  I love it  And we've made this statement  Many times over the years  If you ever do hear us  Apologize for something  We absolutely don't mean it 
[01:47:30]  Were you sorry for  Homeless Charlie?  No  No  Not at all  Not at least  Let's play  Are we allowed to at least  Play the apology?  Yeah where's our apology?  You can hear how  Fucking pissed off we are  How can we not play  The audio here?  I don't get that  Because it  You know  They wanna make believe  It never happened  I'll never understand that  Ridiculous  Stuff happens on our show  And then they try to  Like make it disappear  Like it never happened  It's already out there  I can't stress enough  That if you ever hear us  Apologize  If we get pushed in a corner  And have to apologize  We absolutely don't mean it 
[01:48:00]  As a matter of fact  We mean the opposite of it  Ugh  People  But  Lighten up  Fuckers  You almost bit your own tongue off  When you apologized  Oh I know  They decided that you  Needed to be the one  Because they knew  I would apologize  Oh my god  But then you were so disgusted  Oh I read it like I was reading  A fucking death notice  And then what you hear  That's why I wanna play it again  Because what you hear  Immediately after the apology  Is this  Yeah yeah  It gets thrown away  And then didn't we get in trouble 
[01:48:30]  For not taking the apology  Seriously  Yeah maybe  Yeah maybe  I don't know  I was trying to not breathe  There's been things  I've said  Oh god  Sometimes you lose oxygen  To your brain  If you're trying not to  Like you know  Breathe  Because someone might have  Bad breath  Get it  Yeah okay  There's been things  I said or wrote  That  I kinda wished  I was  I hadn't said or written  Like there's things  I would apologize for  That I've written 
[01:49:00]  Why  Like what Jimmy  Yeah just certain things  But not because I feel  In a book  A couple of things  That I wish I had  Taken  But there's no pressure  It was just my personal  Sometimes you look at something  And go  Eh that was a little harsh  Yeah  I don't necessarily feel  That way now  But it's not a pressure situation  Oh yeah  That's fair enough  That I have no problem with  Yeah  If you come to a place  Where you go  You know what  Eh I kinda wish  I was a little bit nicer  About that  Or not as harsh  At the time  At least that's up  To the individual 
[01:49:30]  I'm sure  100%  I'm sure if someone  Like really sat me  And Ant down  Well I can speak for myself  I'd probably come up  With a few things  We've done over the years  On radio  Where I'm like  Eh yeah  I would apologize  To that person  Whatever  I never want to be told  To apologize  Yeah of course not  I'll apologize  If I think of something  And I've done this  In the past  As a matter of fact  Where I think about something  And think like  Wow you know  At the time  Emotions got away with me  I said things  And then it's like  You know  I'll apologize for that 
[01:50:00]  Obviously  You know  I went overboard  You know what  I accept your apology  Thanks  I've been waiting  For that for years  Oh Jesus  Oh Nelly  No but there  There have been  Circumstances  No there have been  Circumstances though  Where I'll do that  But I never want to be told  That I have to  Fucking apologize  And that's  That's where  Cause that's a phony  Fucking apology  That's where we all  Should be at  Yeah  It should be up to you  Ugh 
[01:50:30]  But to be forced  To apologize  And being threatened  Like look  We're gonna fucking  Boycott  And do all that  That's  There's no place  For that  No  There's no fucking  Place for that  You're just gonna  Make people bitter  It's not gonna  Help your cause  It makes people  Resent your cause  Resent you  Resent your organization  That's what it is  When I read shit  About GLAAD  And them forcing people  Through mob tactics  Like what the fucking  Mafia does to people  To do their bidding 
[01:51:00]  It doesn't garner sympathy  From me  Or from a lot  Of other people  I think it garners sympathy  From most people  Probably in the gay community  Because they  They look at that  Like you know  Like I look at the NRA  Right  But you know  Everyone else is going  Shut the fuck up  And stop crying  It's like when you look at  Who is the woman  Like when I watch  Documentaries on gay  Sorry  I got an update  On the story 
[01:51:30]  Jimmy  Sorry  Go ahead  Finish your thought  I'm really sorry  That's alright  When I watch documentaries  On gay  Marriage and shit  Who is the conservative  Woman who is a  Mouseketeer  I literally  Oh yeah  I want her tits  To get lopped off  Who is she  The orange lady  She's as fucking  Anita Bryant  She to me  Is as hateable  An individual  She's as  I literally  I just hope that she  Dies of something  It can be cancer  It doesn't have to be  But she was dead  Oh good  Is she 
[01:52:00]  I have no idea  But like  As much as I can hate her  For the way she fought  Gay causes  Yeah  How can gay causes  Turn around and start  Annoying me  It's like  Do you know how far  You have to go in one direction  To annoy me now  To now annoy you  As much as I am on your side  Yeah  Yeah  For the record  I just try to bite my own teeth off  Oh shit  Don't do that  That hurts  It's impossible  Unfortunately  What happened?  I'm too busy trying to bite him off again  Oh  What's the story?  T.N. Trucker guy  Thank you  He just sent this to me 
[01:52:30]  Glad taking action  Against Adam Carolla's  Anti-LGBT remarks  Adam Carolla  Blah blah blah  You apologize  Blah blah blah  Glad responded  Adam Carolla  Has a history of making  Anti-LGBT  And racist statements  Said Herndon  Gradick  Holy shit  His last name is  Grad  Dick  I love how that  Always works  Out  Senior director  Of programs 
[01:53:00]  At GLAD  Networks and advertisers  Should remember that  Attacking people  Who are different from him  And following it  With empty apologies  Is just  A regular part  Of Carolla's routine  GLAD will be  Reaching out to its allies  In the entertainment world  To let them know  About Adam Carolla's  History of racist  And homophobic remarks  Following an incident  Last week  The problem  Adam Carolla's doing  Is he's doing it  In a podcast  Well no  I guess you can't even  Do it on a comedy stage  Anymore  I was going to use  That excuse  I mean these fucks  Don't understand humor 
[01:53:30]  The only thing is  You have to fucking  Like Jersey Shore  Is a great example  Of what happens  When you do not listen  Yeah  To fucking  Special interests  Right  Basically MTV  Told the Italian groups  To go fuck themselves  And had 9 million people  Watching on MTV  A couple weeks ago  Yeah  Do not listen to the  Any of these  Special interest shitheads  But the problem is  None of us  Who are not in  Special interest groups  Fight back  You know what I mean  It's like they are 
[01:54:00]  The ones who mobilize  But other people  Do not mobilize  Maybe now that  With social networking  People will a little bit more  We've never been  Allowed to fight back  We've been told  What to do  By our employers  Every single  Fucking time  We're told  Shut your mouth  Don't say anything  We'll handle this  We have our press  And this publicist  Will do this  And say this  And meanwhile  The best people  That are most qualified  To fucking  Quell the problem  Is us 
[01:54:30]  Because we would say  Hey  This is what we are  This is what we do  And be honest about it  Oh good  Instead of some  Bullshit  Fucking  Apology  And statement  That we never  Never fucking  Would have thought up  Ourselves  Or written  So they quote  Adam saying  LGBT  You know  Yuck  That whole thing  We just played  Right  And then they say  This  Corolla at one point  Asked  When did we start 
[01:55:00]  Giving a shit  About these people  And this person  Writes  Wow  What a great joke  It is a great joke  It is a great joke  Don't worry about it  You go through your life  And realize  When I was growing up  And I'm just  Stating facts  You would look at those people  Like it's a freak show  But now all of a sudden  It's not a freak show anymore  Transgender people  You used to  Like pay  50 cents  At a fucking circus  To see shit like that  Yeah  Yeah  Transgender  So when he says  When did we start  Giving a shit  About these people 
[01:55:30]  Yeah it's kind of confusing  Like wait  What  But the language  Was a little too raw  For you  But the truth of the matter  Is  When did  We start giving a shit  About the people  Caring about them  Giving them the rights  That they deserve  When  You know  Shit like that  You can interpret it  Any way you like  No I'm not  But I'm not talking about  Just gays in general  Yeah I know  The fringe  Of  The gay community  Right  Or fringe of any  Part of society  Yeah yeah 
[01:56:00]  The fringe  The people that  Like  Like Jimmy said  The guy with the toupee  You make fun of him  A fucking toupee organization  What if I decided  I wanted to fucking  Frost my hair  I'd be laughed at  Because it just looks silly  But if some  You know  Younger guy  Decides to highlight his hair  He looks great  You know what  How about  A gay guy  Dresses in a dress  He looks like  A fucking idiot  How about  Some can dress in a dress  And look great  You bet they can 
[01:56:30]  Whatever  But how about  Growing up  The guy would always  Dress as the girl  For Halloween  Or what have you  And it was always  Oh look how silly  And ridiculous he looks  Yeah  And that's all we know  Right  So that's what  So when Adam Carolla  Says something like that  Whoa when did we give a  That used to be the goof  Yeah  You're dressing like a woman  You silly  Yeah  You silly goose  But they cannot  See anything else  But hate speech  Their argument would be  For that  Here's what their argument 
[01:57:00]  Would be  If they were in the room  I knew  Here's what they'd say  Well you're right  But people aren't being  Beaten up and killed  For wearing toupees  People aren't being  Targeted for violence  People with toupees  Are allowed to get married  They would have  All these arguments  What the fuck else is  Somebody with a bad toupee  Gets punched in the face  Probably every day  But none of that  Or they don't  They should  But none of that  Has any bearing  On why you can't  Make fun of something  Even though they're  Technically right  Like yeah you're right  People aren't being  Killed for bad  But that doesn't explain  Why you can't make  Fun of something  Right  Because there is not 
[01:57:30]  A correlation between  Goofing on something  And then fucking  Tying up Matthew Shepard  Murdering him  Right  There's not a connection  There  And they say  Well it creates  An environment  Get the  I'm so fucking  Tired  Of the creates  Or fosters  An environment  Argument  It's nonsense  It doesn't  This article goes  On and on  But they're not  Happy  So now  Now they're  Going to attempt  To hold Adam  Carolla hostage  You watch  And by the way  Just like they did  With Tracy fucking  That is a good joke  Because again  It's a great joke  You take any joke  Out of context  With no inflection 
[01:58:00]  I know  You say  When do we start  Giving a shit  About these people  It's a sarcastic  Shitty way of saying  Something that's  Obviously sarcastic  And shitty  He's not just saying  It's a statement of fact  Too bad  But it was humor  Too bad  Too fucking bad  Is what you should  Be saying to these people  It's humor  It's a fucking joke  Why don't these motherfuckers  Just stop listening  To anything  Watching anything  They don't listen  Accepting letters  About people  Yeah I know  They got their people  Out there  That are constantly  Recording and sending  In little clips  Here and there  They don't listen 
[01:58:30]  To any of this stuff  Here's our apology  From four years ago  Wow  We have these CBS  And XM apologies  What's this about  I guess you had to  Apologize  On both platforms  Yeah at the beginning  Of each  Before the CBS  Because of XM  Before the CBS show  Started  You had to read  The apology from CBS  Right  While Tom was in  The other room  Having it dumped out  On the CBS network  It was going out  Live over the XM  So you had to do it  Before the CBS show  Started  Then when we did  The walk over 
[01:59:00]  And got to XM  You had to do it again  For the XM portion  Alright and this is  Basically  We almost  We were going to  Get fired for this  Because Hugh Pinero  I'll name him by name  Didn't understand us  Or our fucking show  He's not going to do  Anything for us anymore  Whatever  But he didn't like us  For some reason  He was talked into  Bringing the show to XM  And we were fucked  We were dead in the water  Until they hired Eric Logan  And he  He  He  He turned  A bunch of people's  Opinions around  But it was still  A tough fight over there  It really was 
[01:59:30]  So we had this  Homeless guy come in  That we met  On the walk over  Didn't know him  From a fucking  Hole in the wall  But he had  Like comedic timing  He was funny  Funny guy man  Sort of like a  Richard Pryor  Feel to the  God damn guy  We haven't seen him since  I'm convinced  The government killed him  I'm convinced  That a van  Just fucking  Swept him up one day  Never to be heard  From again  So he comes in  And it's just  He was killing  On the radio  Hilarious shit  But it was very  Outrageous and edgy  Talking about  The first lady  The queen 
[02:00:00]  Yeah he wanted to  Fucking rape her  Fuck Condoleezza Rice  He's a homeless guy  Yeah  And by the way  If that was a movie  About a guy  That would be  Perfectly acceptable  Right  But because he said  It in humor  I fucking laughed at it  I would always laugh  At a guy  Being that barbarically  Inappropriate  That's what the joke was  My whole take on it  Was if you can't  Use satellite radio  An uncensored  Medium  For that  To bring a homeless  Guy up  Out of nowhere  And have him 
[02:00:30]  Go off  With that  Crazy homeless  Fucking mind  Yeah  And give him  An open forum  That no one else  Would ever give him  To say whatever  The fuck he wanted  If you can't  Use satellite radio  For that  Right  You're absolutely  Correct  And the other part of it  Every once in a while  We'll have someone come in  And they'll say some stuff  And as hosts  You gotta go  Whoa  That's what you're saying  Or whoa  We don't know that  You know what I mean  So we're aware enough  To kind of protect  Our interest  The company's interest 
[02:01:00]  We're always aware of that  But that day  We're like  Who the fuck  Is gonna take this guy serious  He's a homeless bum  No offense Charlie  If you still listen to us  But you are  But you're a funny homeless bum  Funny man  And we thought  Nothing of it  Thinking this is  Completely fine radio  A lunatic  Just ranting and raving  And being funny  As he does it  I loved him  I thought he was  I had visions of like  Holy shit  He's gonna be a regular  On our show  Dude  Same thing  His fucking inflection  He was talking about  His Jew landlord  And white people 
[02:01:30]  He bashed everybody  From the same bitter place  The beauty of him  Attacking the Queen of England  Laura Bush  Condoleezza  Whoever he was  Was that  Was that he was  This fucking guy  With nothing  Who was just  Sounding off  At all of these people  Of prosperity  Right  And the fucking fact  That we had to apologize  For that  And the fucking company  Didn't stick with us  No company sticks with you  That's why I don't hate  Fucking the Catholic League  That's why I do not have  Any issue with the Catholic League  Because they didn't 
[02:02:00]  Fucking fire us  They're not  He's not  Bill Donner  He's not a pussy boy lawyer  He's not the lawyer  Yeah  He's just a guy complaining  Douchebags  That were like  Yeah let's have  The internal investigation  All that corporate horse shit  That happens  Right  That's who  He's not  He's not that guy  Right Sam  I don't like him  That's right  I have no issue  You guys  It's your guys show  It's your guys  You think someone like  Homeless Charlie  Could be a stand up  If he like  Honed it  I know it's not  If he stopped  Shitting his pants  Yeah  Yes probably  He had some natural abilities 
[02:02:30]  Right Jimmy  I thought he was very funny  If he cleaned up a little bit  And got his life  A little bit together  What about that Bush bitch  Yeah  Just funny  He just made me laugh  Hilarious  What a funny thing to say  And if you have that  Segment out there  Hold on to it  Because that's a tough one to find  That's a hard one  I know the hardcores  Have a lot of our shit  They have almost all our shows  But that one is just tough  To fucking find man  I want to hear it  If someone has it  Email it to me  Yeah  The Real Jim Norton  At Gmail  Please  I'd love to hear it  I have it  I'll give it  Okay thanks  Not to turn it into 
[02:03:00]  Like beat up these guys  But I mean  If you really want us  To respect you a little bit  Today  Just fucking figure out  How we can play it  It's fine  It's not going to hurt anybody  But four years ago  We had to apologize  To homeless Charlie  We were forced to  Absolutely forced to  Or we were going to be  Fucking fired  And this is how it went down  You could hear the disgust  In Anthony's voice  Listen for the  I think the crumpling  Of the paper  If I remember this correctly  Yeah this wasn't fun  Alright hit it  Hey guys  It's Opie and Anthony  What's up  Good morning  Got to take this opportunity 
[02:03:30]  First  Right off the bat here  Because of things  That have happened  Of course  Have to apologize  To public officials  For comments  That were made  On our XM show  On May 9th  We take very seriously  The responsibility  That comes with  Our creative freedom  And regret any offense  That the segment  That we're talking about  Has caused  So what  Definitely apologize  For that  That's enraging 
[02:04:00]  To listen to  That's so enraging  Sounded sincere  Didn't it  No  Oh it didn't  Why did it cut out  Because right  At that point  You hit the rage music  Okay  And then  We have apology number two  I think it's the one  With the crumpling  Of the paper  Maybe I remember it differently  Go ahead  Hey we're here  It's Opie and Anthony  It's May 11th  2007  We are live  I just want to say  We're taking what happened 
[02:04:30]  On Wednesday  Oh  Very very seriously  Stop this fucking thing  It wasn't good enough  That Ant read it for the show  I remember this now  Yeah  I got a talking to  My phone rang  It's like  No not good enough  You need to say something too  They need to hear  Both your fucking voices  Like you gotta be fucking  Enough already  Alright go ahead  Hey we're here  It's Opie and Anthony  It's May 11th  2007  We are live  I just want to say  We're taking what happened  On Wednesday  Very very seriously 
[02:05:00]  Very very seriously  No we're not  And we're listening to  XM on this one  Big time  Don't be a pussy  Yeah we apologize  To the public officials  For comments  That were made  On the XM show  On May 9th  And we do take  Very seriously  The responsibility  That comes with  Our creative freedom  That we get here  And regret any offense  That this segment  Has caused  And that sounds like  It was right out of my mouth  You know what though  You were smart to do it  Because the rebel attitude  Of fuck them  We're not doing it  We would have been at a gig 
[02:05:30]  Four years ago  So it was a smart thing  To do in the moment  And obviously everybody  Who knows this show  Knows that it was  At gunpoint  It was forced right  Yeah you know what  You just hate fucking  Sucking on the big dick  To keep your fucking job  Come on  All right  Maybe I should say  Son18  Need a better Twitter name  Remember recently  When Nike told Mayor Menino  To fuck himself  It ended there  Yeah  Mayor Menino  Was trying to get  You know  Get people rallying  Behind him  About what Nike  Was doing with t-shirts  Yeah 
[02:06:00]  And Nike was like  Fuck you  And guess what  Mayor Menino  Had to walk away  Embarrassed  That was our last  XM show for 30 days  Yeah  Damn  That would be nice  Well because  Because then we realized  That wasn't good enough  Which meant we shouldn't  Have apologized  Apologized at all  Because it wasn't  Going to make  A lick of fucking difference  Yeah  So then they're like  We got to get you  Off the air for 30 days  And I remember  Eric Logan called me  I was like  I'm trying to remember  I was like  I don't know  Whatever  I was walking in the city  Maybe walking home 
[02:06:30]  Or something  And he goes  We're suspending you  For 30 days  I'm yelling and screaming  I'm just like  Look dude  No you have no idea  This is the best  I could get for you guys  You have to understand  This one  Believe that piece  Like fucking shit  Boss always wanted  To have us fired  Yeah  I do  That fucking worm  Not Eric Logan  No I always hated  I can't say hated  Because I just didn't  Like Hugh Panaro  I didn't hate him  Because I met him once  He was pleasant  Never trusted him  I never liked him though  He never liked him  Knew he didn't like us  I hate to say it  No I don't hate to say it 
[02:07:00]  He's the reason why  These two companies  Had a fucking merge  Because he didn't know  What the fuck he was doing  He didn't know  What the fuck he was doing  Yeah hands full  And it got to the point  Where you know  He started  You know  They had to fucking  Start talking  And go fuck  We gotta  We gotta save each other here  XM was way the fuck ahead  Yeah  And then they just floundered  Alright  Why don't we break  Get back in a good mood  Bob Kelly's here  Outside the studio  Yeah Bobby's out there  And Paulie D from Jersey Shore 
[02:07:30]  Is gonna be here  In a half hour  I am  And then Joel McHale  A little later this morning  Yeah man  I'm looking forward  To seeing Paulie D  We got some guests  I like the Paulie D  You like the Paulie D  Sam  I love Paulie D  Not a fan of Ronnie  Not a fan of Dina  Even though she's coming in tomorrow  Not a fan of Snooki  Fan of Vinny  Snooki  Go for it  Not a fan of Sammy  Since you know what  I didn't like the guy at all  But then he came in here  And he was alright  He's a psychopath  Yeah he's completely a psychopath  I think he might be coming back in here 
[02:08:00]  Like in several weeks  After vacation  Yeah  JWoww turned me around  She was really cool  When she was on  Oh yeah  And who else am I missing  Maybe Dina will turn you around too  She's a goer  Yeah  When's the wedding  The gay wedding  Yeah  11am  Oh  See I'm gonna be gone by then  You'd like to have attended  Well I would like to  At least watch from afar  It was invite only  So we could understand  What are they gonna pull the curtains  That's right  Are they gonna touch stuff  Everybody's  It's their studio 
[02:08:30]  They're in the fishbowl  No I mean are they gonna touch  Other things around here  Like what  Frank DiCaro works here  He's touched so many things  I'm a germaphobe  Can you get me some of that shit  I'm not gonna get you anything  Purell  Purell please  Do we have hazmat suits  No  So we can leave properly today  It's not even somewhat tolerant  Somewhat tolerant  Bob Kelly in studio 
[02:09:00]  A couple things going on  See Sam  Sam just fled the studio  Because  I wanted to bring to everyone's attention  That they're bringing in a lot of flowers  For the gay wedding  And the money that Sirius XM spent on the flowers  Could have been Sam's race  But Sam doesn't want any part of this bit  So he just ran away  No he's very scared  We're just trying to take care of him man  Just trying to take care of the kid 
[02:09:30]  Matt  By the way  Many of the groups that get upset at things  During the commercial break  When we were off the microphone  I was just blurting out horrific epithets  Well I told  As I was reading things  I told Anna  Just guess which groups they are  Because  It's easy  Well I can say this  You were reading more of the GLAAD thing  And it's infuriating  Well that too  And I was telling Anna  When GLAAD does this nonsense  To entertainers and comics  And all  And what not  Yes 
[02:10:00]  As an entertainer  Any understanding I have  Sort of shrinks  And then I told Anna  It makes you wanna  As an entertainer  Take those low blows  Go for the jugular  Yeah  Take those low blows  Like oh really  Now watch what I subtly do  Yeah  Because it's your only recourse  When you read this stuff  What was that one line  You read out loud to us  Do you remember  It's  Like this guy from GLAAD  Is trying to tell Adam Carolla  And everyone else  That makes a living 
[02:10:30]  Being funny  Being funny  What's funny  What funny is  What the definition of funny is  And that's what's enraging  You don't find it funny  No  That's okay  But don't tell everyone else  That they shouldn't laugh  At shit like that  And you can't say it's not funny  What Adam Carolla doesn't understand  Is that ignorance  Does not give his act  An edge  In fact  Ignorance is about  As far from an edge  As you can get  It's unchallenging  It's flat  And it's dull  There's nothing funny 
[02:11:00]  About saying  We shouldn't teach  The transgender people  That we  You shouldn't teach  That transgender people  Deserve respect  But Adam Carolla's  Decision to use  One of the country's  Most marginalized communities  As a target  Is not just  Lazy comedy  It reinforces the idea  That transgender people  Shouldn't be treated  With the same respect  As everyone else  An attitude that leads  To discrimination  There you go  Harassment  And violence 
[02:11:30]  There you go  Reinforces the idea  And it leads  That guy who said that  You're fucking wrong  You're a liar  It doesn't lead to it  Adam Carolla  Making fun of something  Does not lead  To violence  You're fucking lying  Show the facts on that one  You were real quick  To point out the facts  That gay couples  That adopt children  Their children  Are just as well adjusted  As children of straight parents  You brought up  That fucking statement  Because Adam 
[02:12:00]  I guess at one point  It said that  Gay straight parents  Were better than gay parents  I'm sure he was making a joke  And even if he wasn't  That's his opinion  But then they have to  You know  Nothing makes comedy  That much better  Than throwing statistics  In it  To refute  What a comedian  Is saying  Shut the fuck up  Just shut up  And enjoy your lives  It's fucking  It is simply  They're just trying  To find excuses  As to why they can  Stop you from saying 
[02:12:30]  Something they don't like  That's all it is  But it's also headlines  I don't like it  They want to get  This is a great time  For them to get in the news  Yep  And get awareness  Of their fucking group  Of course  And their main people  This is who we are  Oh really  So other people  Have to become  Sacrificial fucking lambs  That's it  Like people have to  Lose their jobs  And careers  So they can get  In the newspaper  Fuck you  Yeah but isn't  A podcast  They can't fuck  With a podcast  That's what I was saying  Apparently they can 
[02:13:00]  He can't take you  Off the internet  I know  No we explained  This whole thing  About an hour ago  Bobby  You're absolutely right  That's what you  Should be thinking  But nah  It's  Yeah but you can get  Your own server  Yeah  No but the problem is  He's now making money  With his podcast  Oh he's gonna lose his  So there's some pressure  Possibly being put  On advertisers  Right  Plus someone like  Adam Carolla  Has other things he does  To make a living  Like he's got a couple  Projects coming out  Once you  Oh yeah they could get to you  Even on a podcast  Once you start working  With anyone else 
[02:13:30]  You then open yourself up  For people from communities  The man  To fuck with you  From whatever community  Fill in the fucking blank  Community  To fuck with you  Yeah it's infuriating  I read that whole thing  The whole statement  That's on GLAAD's webpage  I guess  Go fucking find it  I could go with  20 jokes of  What it is dot com  But I want to keep  My job a little longer  Wow could I make some  Go to this site dot com  That site dot com 
[02:14:00]  Yeah happy  To get to the GLAAD page  The GLAAD  Yeah see  Can we just stop  Using the word gay  Also for gay people  Because gay  As we know  Used to mean happy  Fun  And then they turned it  Into being homosexual  And it's not anymore  Can we just change  The word fucking miserable  To mean homosexual  Now and gay  So GLAAD could say  The miserable community  Is very angry  About what's saying  Gay was fun  The gay 90s  Right  Going out  Having a gay old time 
[02:14:30]  Like on the Flintstones  That song  What do you mean  The gay 90s  The gay in the gay 90s  In the 1890s  Oh okay  It was the gay 90s  That's what you were up to  In the 1990s  What  Oh  Well you know  You can call it  The gay 90s  You scared me  You scared me there  Was it the 1890s  You're talking about  Scootilya doo  Okay  The gay  Just stop using  The word gay  I'm offended  By your use of the word  Gay  Because it means happy  And you apparently  Are fucking miserable 
[02:15:00]  Well I'll tell you this  Much  Adam Carolla  It'll be very interesting  To see how he handles  This one  Yes  I don't think he'll  Back off  I think Adam  He's the benchmark  Right now  That's what we're  Hoping for  He's the benchmark  Of podcasts  And everything like that  I was extremely disappointed  How far in Tracy Morgan  Went with  Oh my god  What they wanted him to do  They had him like  Kunta Kinte  They sure did  They fucking had him  In chains  Parading him around the country  On a homosexual  Apology tour  I said it on this show  He was held hostage 
[02:15:30]  Yes  And they decided  When they were going  To let him go  We'll see what happens  With Adam on this one  Because it's not going away  Yeah but he was  He was involved more  In corporate  The corporate side  Of show business  Adam's  Adam's  Exactly  Adam's doing his own thing  So he'll probably  Be better off  But the thing is  Even though he was  Involved in the corporate side  And he was trying  To protect his fucking  NBC gig  Right  The fact that  Glad took such advantage  Of it  As to parade him  Around the country  Apologizing  Is despicable  On their part  Despicable 
[02:16:00]  And most people I know  Are disgusted by it  Yeah  By the phony apology  By special interest groups  In general  It's just assholes  In show business  They're the same people  That are involved  In advertising  They just  They're fucking  Socially  They're cowards  Yeah  I was in the audition  Yesterday  For that shitty voiceover  How'd you do?  The only thing I can book  Is Angry Baby  If they have an Angry Baby  I'm in  Remember Angry Baby  Was pesky  Yeah yesterday  Was just baby  And I couldn't do it  Love Angry Baby 
[02:16:30]  Fuck  But the guy comes out  He goes  All these beautiful women  Gorgeous girls  Smoking hot  Va va voom  Don't threaten me  With a good time  23  So  So he comes out  He goes  Listen ladies  Just a little direction  When you're  Don't be so mad  Really  Don't come at  The mucus  Don't be angry  At the mucus  Because  They  They don't like  The way that  A lot of you guys  Are coming in  And you're really  Being angry  At the music  Like the mucus  Is a bad thing 
[02:17:00]  We have to  Kind of like  Everybody  So say it  In a friendlier way  To the mucus  You can't  Fucking be angry  At the mucus  Because apparently  Some people  Complain  That the commercials  Too mean  To the mucus  To the mucus  To the little  Cartooner  Mucus  I know that  Cartoon snot shit  Yeah  Alright we got  Bruce a gay guy  And we also have  Bruce a gay guy  Really  Is this real  And we got some info  Bruce is statistically 
[02:17:30]  Big gay name  On what's going on  With Adam Carolla  And how they're  Going to try to hurt him  But first we got  Bruce  Bruce go ahead buddy  Well first off  Anthony what's wrong  With the name Bruce  Just because my name  Is Bruce  Doesn't give you  Free opportunity  To run rampant  Upon gay individuals  It's just stereotypically  A gay name  So I believed  You were probably  Faking one of our  Dopey listeners  That thought he would  Call in a fake gay voice  And name himself Bruce  But that's all  Silly me  But I guess your parents  Just knew when you  Were coming out of mommy  Yeah yeah  He said this is a 
[02:18:00]  Bruce  Alright let her rip  Bruce  Okay  First off  Don't lump all of  The gay community  In with that  Fat  Ridiculous individual  That is  That is trying  To represent us  It's an old  Gay queen  With a lot of  Hatred  It's not  The gay community  Who are you talking about  The guy from  Glad Bruce  Well of course  The guy  Alright alright  Let me  He's been ranting  And raving  About all morning  So why does he  Have so much power  Within your community  He's obviously 
[02:18:30]  Getting things done  It's like Reverend Al  That's not it  He does not have  The power  Unless you give it  It's not my fault  Or my community's fault  That we have  Representatives  Just as you do  In your community  That are worthless  Reverend Al  Is a perfect example  Even the people  In the congress  And senate  They're ridiculous  But I don't consider  You to be part of it  That's true  I'm learning something today  So you're saying  The guy from Glad  Is just as bad  As a Reverend Al 
[02:19:00]  To most of  Most of your community  Absolutely  Holy shit  I don't know  He should be written off  Then and not  Acknowledged  Right but the thing is  Though blacks don't  Really speak out  Much against Reverend Al  And you never hear  Gay people  Criticizing or disagreeing  Publicly with GLAD  Well I don't know  What to tell you  You're not in our community  But I mean  That's true  But I mean  You don't hear Jews  Publicly disagreeing  With the JDL either  You never hear  Special interest groups  Being publicly disagreed  With by their constituents  Whether they're  Willing constituents or not 
[02:19:30]  Well I don't have  A platform Jimmy  I don't have anywhere  I can voice my opinion  Today you gave me one  Yeah no I mean  In general  I mean in general  Not necessarily  Like as an individual  Regular working guy  I mean you know  Just in general  You don't hear it  Hey Bruce how  How gay are you?  From  Goose  No no  I asked this  Did you hear  What Adam said?  Were you listening  To the show  When we played back  Audio from his podcast?  Absolutely  Alright  Were you offended?  By no means 
[02:20:00]  Jesus Christ  Of course not  Thank you  Thank you Bruce  Someone with some sense  I would hug you  If I was guaranteed  Not to catch anything  But thank you  Oh that's not  Even appropriate  Sorry Bruce  I'm fucking around  I'd just be afraid  I might get a rod  It happens  It's been known to happen  Turn it off  Bruce thank you  For saying that though  Alright so  You weren't offended  By what Adam said  Did he hang out  He was going into a tunnel 
[02:20:30]  Oh jeez  Wow that's interesting  The community looks at that guy  Like you know  Well some  But the thing is  When you have all the juice like that  The power  He's wielding power  Because look what he got  Tracy Morgan to do  I know  This is what they're trying to do  To Adam Carolla  This is  Go ahead Tommy  Tommy  Tommy what's up buddy  Tommy  Hey my daughter goes to a college  I'd rather not say which one  And she has four roommates 
[02:21:00]  Or three roommates  And two of them belong to this  Late LGBT  Whatever it is  Which is part of GLAD  Yeah  And they were talking about this  And they're saying  If they don't get the proper apology  That they're going to call for Apple  To pull his podcast  Or they're going to call  For a nationwide boycott of Apple  Alright listen to me  What happened to an apology  Now it has to be the proper apology  Yes  For offer  Right  By the way  What is a proper apology  I have no idea 
[02:21:30]  I thought you were saying  Hey my bad was good enough  But I guess not anymore  I don't think Apple will pull it  To be honest with you  I don't know if Apple  Can't  First of all  A nationwide boycott of Apple  Get the fuck out of here  Do you really think  Gay people are going to  Download music  Or move  That would last for  Fucking three hours  It's not Selma  In 1965  A boycott of Apple  Is not going to work  Go ahead  Waxing fantastic  Boycott Apple 
[02:22:00]  I dare you  It's not going to mean anything  No  You're not going to hurt Apple  They're bigger than Exxon  But the press gets a hold of it  Apple might  And then Apple goes  Oh  We're very liberal  It doesn't matter  What basis would they remove that  The fucking rap albums  They sell  Apple does whatever the fuck they want  They remove shit  They take shit off  I could see them doing that  For any reason  Jimmy  I could see them doing that  Apple's pretty tight man  They'd fucking do that in a second  I could read it already 
[02:22:30]  You know we've received many complaints  From GLAAD and other organizations  And we feel tolerance is most important  In the Apple community  And we are joining together with Blahdy Blah  Boom  He's gone  I could see that happening  He could get his own server  I don't know if there's any nerds out there  But he could get his own server  And get donations  And still do his podcast  He could tell everybody  Go fuck yourself  I'm just going to go do my  Right? 
[02:23:00]  I don't think so  Because what happens is  They leak into other projects he's doing  They're sneaky  He would have to just  They're sneaky  Just do the podcast  When me and Ed  And Jimmy  Obviously got fired for Sex for Sam  So I'm saying nine years ago today  I thought it was nine years ago yesterday  Congratulations guys  Thanks man  We got fired because  Because the corporation  Was much bigger than just radio stations  They were worried it was going to affect their  Their blockbuster business  Can we just stop for one second Opie? 
[02:23:30]  You got fired because you sent somebody into a Catholic church  Nope  And stuck something in somebody's asshole  To this day we don't even know if that ever happened  And recorded it  Oh it never happened  Okay  No we don't know  Oh okay  I honestly have no idea if they ever did anything  But if they didn't fire us  Nothing would have happened  I know what you're saying  I was just trying to be funny  It would have been fine  Sorry and I should have went with the joke  I apologize  You're right  You're right  No but I get you  I understand  But with Adam Kroll  It's not just  They're going focusing on his podcast  They're focusing on other things he's doing 
[02:24:00]  That might be an easier get  Right  You know what I'm saying  They just again  Special interest groups have become leeches  And what they do is  Whenever they see an opportunity  They hear something they don't like  They latch on to the public figure like a leech  And they force you to spout their message  And they all do it  This is not a gay issue  Blacks do it  Italians do it  I'm sure the JDL  Every fucking group finds you saying something they don't like  And they know the difference between hate speech  And a joke that is just tasteless 
[02:24:30]  There is a difference  Two Jews walk into a bar  Hey  You're an anti-Semite  Is not considered hate speech in this fucking pussy country  Reverend Al did it to Imus  I see Imus on the TV this morning  And let's not forget  Reverend Al owned fucking Imus for a while  And then eventually let him go  I'm sorry I did that  I'm sorry  How happy I am  I attacked that fat pig in my fucking book  And on Twitter  Absolutely  It just feels creatively satisfying  It's there  It's there  In history now  Fuck that motherfucker  I'm wondering if the comics are going to get behind 
[02:25:00]  They're going to get behind him  And stick up for him  If Apple pulls  I'm sorry about it  If Apple pulls his podcast  A comic should fucking pull our CDs off of Apple  It won't hurt their business  But it's a state  I'm not going to hurt Apple  They don't give a fuck if I'm on there or not  Right  But every comedian  Who's not a PC fucking little sissy  Should fucking pull your CDs  And your stuff off of fucking iTunes  If they pull him  Because dummies you're next  But where is his  I mean where is his voice though  Is it just him speaking up for him 
[02:25:30]  Who sticks up for him  The way it is  Is that our responsibility  Of course it is  To get behind him  And fucking rap  I mean that's it  We're lazy  I don't want to fuck up my life  Right  I have to take a nap after O&A  Because I got to play Call of Duty later  Of course  So if there's a rally to help out  Oh fuck  Do I really  I mean is that  Is that the problem  If we all stood up and backed him up  And became a bigger monster  Than their fucking monster  We're much bigger than Glad  Absolutely  But yeah 
[02:26:00]  We don't do it  We just don't do it  They just don't care  Not don't care  You just  Don't have the energy  We don't back each other  Yeah  We back each other in theory  Like yeah  Like if the way to vote was  Somebody goes  Hey do you back him  And you go yeah  And that counted  We'd all back people  Because we think  It should be common sense  Is what it is  Why should we have to get together  Into a group  To protest something  Or to voice our side  Of an argument  When their side  Is so utterly  Fucking ridiculous  That it's basic common sense 
[02:26:30]  That everyone should just know this  If fucking  And again  My stuff on app  On iTunes  Means nothing  It really doesn't  On their  But if they pull his podcast  I will fucking  Yank my material  Off of iTunes  And again  It will not affect them  Yeah  One I will  I'll pull my CD off  Not my podcast  But  Well  I'll pull that CD  Right down  Everyone should pull their shit off  It's the only way to fucking  Yeah  What are we looking at  Oh the people  Just walking by  Saying hi  They  Yeah but  That won't do anything either 
[02:27:00]  That's still silent  I mean yeah  Okay  A bunch of comedians  Did something  That's  But these people  Get in the news  They get in the fucking  They  They rally  Well the press already  The press also covers them  Yeah but nobody backs up  Adam  We're all sitting there  We back him up  And that's for a radio show  But this is gone  This is fucking in the air  And gone  We don't get behind  If we got behind him  And  In what way  Would the press even cover it  The press loves covering GLAAD  They wouldn't  But they like here 
[02:27:30]  The other side too  Because it's  It pushes the story  So there's a pushback  Remember when we got in trouble  That fucking  Pushback  Debbie and those groups  They talked to them  And they got them on TV  Debbie was on television  Immediately  Because it allowed them  To have a fucking argument  And we're pushing back today man  And changing people's opinions  And you know  Getting people to  Get a little motivated  More motivated than they have been  But you'd have to do it  Today  Tomorrow  The next day  Get people together  We're all about this  We're all about this  We were all in 
[02:28:00]  With Tracy Morgan  You know  Yeah but they go  We pushed back  As much as we could  With the Tracy Morgan story  And we're going to  Absolutely push back  With this one as well  This is a little different  Than what Tracy did though  Don't you think  No  Not really  What are you talking about  This was on a stage too  It's comedy  It's fucking  What you thought  Tracy went too far  No I don't think  He went too far  I think he was trying  To be funny  I think it's very similar  But he  What he said  Was a little harsher  Than that  Tracy  Yeah I don't fucking  Stab my little kid  If he's a faggot  In context  That's a little 
[02:28:30]  In context of a bit  Yeah  Of comedy on a stage  He wasn't on a fucking  Soapbox in Times Square  Professing his  Personal opinions  On homosexuality  He's making people  Laugh from a stage  If you want to be  As tasteless  And horrid  As you want  You should be able  To do that  On stage  As an act  You're doing  A fucking act  I agree with you  I'm just saying  It's  This is  I think  What he said  Was  A little light 
[02:29:00]  A little lighter  Than what Tracy did  I think what Tracy said  It was shocking  It had shock value  That's all I'm saying  But his shock value  Do you honestly think  Tracy would fucking stab  I think Tracy would stab  Anybody  Really  No  He's a sweetheart  Not based on anything  Because he's just crazy  He's a sweetheart  Yeah  No  The whole  Apologies that he had to do  And all this  It was taken from  Something he said  As a character  He is on stage 
[02:29:30]  We're all fucking  And you know  Yeah  I'm Anthony Cumia  On the Opie and Anthony  Radio show  But I'm not always  Exactly like this guy  On the radio  Hate to  Hate to bust up  Your fucking opinions  Of me out there  You usually have to get  Drunk with a gun  I'm much worse  Than I am on the air  No it's  But it's different  And I like the idea  Of being able to have  That proverbial  Scarlet letter on me  Of I'm a racist  I'm fucking  Homophobic  I'm this  It gives me a freedom  Where people are like 
[02:30:00]  He expected out of him  He just says that  I enjoy that  I love it  I love when people  Call me a racist  You know why  I know really deep down  I'm not a true  Fucking racist  I look at shit  And I'll comment on it  Open and honestly  And people call me  A racist for that  But you know what  I don't take people  At face value  With race  And instantly  Slap a label on them  But when I see  Something happening  That is stereotypical 
[02:30:30]  Of a certain race  Holy shit  I'm all over it  Why wouldn't you be  Right  Yeah  But I catch shit for it  But not as much  As a lot of other people  Because I've embraced it  I've embraced it  It's great  It's freeing  It's like Norton  With trannies  Exactly  I'd be  Bob's gay  Oh my god  Norton's just a free  Wielding  Happy boy  Yeah  Norton's not gay at all  I love women  No of course  Women are my thing  What am I  You can't all of a sudden  Well you can't fucking  You can't play baseball 
[02:31:00]  And football  Turn it off  Turn it off  He loves it  Push that down  Well that comic in Canada  Is taking it to the  Supreme Court up there  He got banned  From doing comedy  Well that's Canada  In British Columbia  Canada's wacky  They're wacky  Zipping up there  Canada stinks  You gotta understand though  That's fucking nuts  That somebody got sued  For $22,000  So they're all stoned up there  And banned from doing comedy  For saying  Shit to a couple lesbians  That's crazy  Imagine if that comes down here 
[02:31:30]  Ugh  Please  Where's Pauly D?  Pauly D is five minutes out  Cool  Nice  What does that mean?  Five minutes out  Five minutes?  Yeah you gotta  And then you  And then  And then  Why'd you just do that?  He touched you  He caressed my belly  It's there  You don't do that  You're alright with that  Right?  No  I'm not alright with this  You've known him for years  I've known him for years  And he's been caressing me  For years 
[02:32:00]  And you finally had it?  No  I've always not  I've never liked it  I've never liked his little  No one will touch you  Like in an airport  Or waiting in line  Come on dude  I touch your thighs  So what?  Get out of here  Why have we gone two days  Without talking about  Rich Voss losing his condo  In a fire  Holy shit  Yeah we didn't talk about that  You didn't bring that up yesterday?  I thought that would be  The first thing you talked about  Nope  He lost all those polo shirts  What about that giant  Obnoxious couch? 
[02:32:30]  Did he lose that?  He lost a lot  Can we get him on the air?  There's photos on the internet  Can we get him on after  Pauly D?  Oh  Gotta see how he's doing  He should have stood  In the living room  Doing a tongue twister  Would have put the fire out  So you guys gotta get on Twitter  Cause the show continues  After this  Through our Twitters  And you know  We've been discussing this  Since the weekend  But Rich Voss  Had a major fire  At his condo  Jewish lightning you think?  And I don't know  But  You know they call it that  Yeah 
[02:33:00]  You light a match  And when everything's conned  You light a match  Make sure my golf club  Is on in the room  There are the pictures  Of the fire  This place is unlivable  And won't be livable  Anytime fucking soon  Wow  I got him on the phone  On Sunday  He said the condo  Above him  Looks like it's gonna  Collapse into his  How did it start?  They're saying  I didn't really understand  How he was explaining this to me 
[02:33:30]  But I guess they're blaming  His  Balcony  His balcony  Yeah  It started on his balcony  And he goes  But Bonnie went out there  And didn't see any fire  When she smelled smoke  So I'm like  Then how does it start  On your balcony  If you don't see the fire?  It was on the balcony  Maybe a lantern  So maybe it started  Underneath their balcony  Or something  Maybe a lantern  They may have had a lantern  A lantern  Whatever it is  It was on their balcony  Maybe they were selling  Balcony smolders  I'm just glad  All that antique furniture  Got burned  Oh  The grandma furniture 
[02:34:00]  Just update you  Go to Ikea  For Christ's sake  You only lost the furniture?  I fucking hate  Antique shit  I don't like it either  Mahogany  Go fuck yourself  Antiques suck  It's just old stuff  Hard couches  Yeah you feel like  You're in Nanny's  Nanna's I guess  Nanna's house  Nanna's house  When you go through  Voss' house  So they said  It started on his balcony  Did he have a barbecue  Out there?  No  He had two chairs  And metal chairs  And a table  How did something start  There's nothing to burn?  That's what he says  Maybe Bonnie's a fire bug 
[02:34:30]  What?  Trying to kill him?  She's trying to burn  Her marriage license  I felt like  That was the easiest way  We'll get Voss on  After Paulie D  From Jersey  That's unbelievable  Yeah we gotta hear that  He's staying in a hotel  Right now  Yep  They gotta get me a house  Wow  I bet it was like  Donald Trump  On balcony  Going you're fire  That's pretty good  Thanks  I fucking hate you  Did he lose anything 
[02:35:00]  Like really really valuable  To him  Like important stuff  I think he lost  Rita's tweets  Are pretty funny  Actually about it  He's got a good sense  Of humor about it  He lost his  A lot of clothes  Because his room  Was fucked up  His room got fucked up  I talked to him  That night  He called me  I was actually  At the red eye party  And he goes  He was talking  He's really fucked up  He's getting on a plane  From Sacramento  And he goes  He told me what happened  And then he goes  He told me about the balcony 
[02:35:30]  And he goes  That's where they said  It started  I'm like  You think it started there  He goes  Well either there  Or in Bonnie's pussy  Because that's dry  This is just a funny dude  Now there's the condo  All boarded up  All boarded up  He ain't living there  I think that place is done  Where do you start  With a gutted fucking  Condo  From a fire  That's exactly what I thought  What do you get out of that  Do you know  What  You have a condo  Yeah  You can't live there anymore  At all  Yeah 
[02:36:00]  What happens to you  I guess insurance  Insurance  They pick up the condo  And what it costs  They have to  Holy shit  Yeah they pick up the hotel  Your living expenses  And they pay  What about the value  Of your condo  They pick up that too  Oh they'll rebuild  If they can  If they can't rebuild  Now I know why  My insurance is so  God damn high  You need that insurance  When you buy a place  They don't trust you  Yeah you have to have it  They don't trust you  To fucking  Hey I won't start a fire  It's like yeah  My house burnt down  I owe fucking  Two million on it  Take it easy  I need a safe 
[02:36:30]  He saves himself  In the safe  He's got a fireproof safe  A lot of stuff  Fireproof safe  Will stuff melt in there  Or no  Oh yeah  That would be the  Hence the fireproof  At the beginning of it  Stupid  What the fuck  Did Voss just  Jump into your body  No but Voss  There's some stuff  Melt in there  Fireproof safe  Does that mean  That fire will get  Inside of it  No  No it's fire  The flames knew  The combination  Like a cartoon  No I thought  It would burn  Or something  Because it was  Proof that there was  A fire  Oh see 
[02:37:00]  That would  Fucking chip  I like that chip  Can reverse  Norton's stupidness  How could shrimp  Be jumbo  That's exactly it  Fireproof safe  I know there are  Some really good  Fireproof safes  And some really  Like shitty ones  Like in the bank  They're rated  Yes  They are rated  For temperature and time  Mine's made out of  Mahogany  Probably not a good  Safe  Why  For fires  It looks beautiful  In my place  Nice mahogany 
[02:37:30]  And it's bestest  Covering  Yes  Yours is windproof  Huh  Nice  What happened  Wow  Of course the wind blows  I was thinking  The three pigs  Where's Paulie  His  His safe was made  Of wood  Why don't you  Let Sam  Why don't you  Swap with Bobby  Oh is he here  He'll be here in a second  Oh he's gonna be here  In a second  You ever see that  Christopher Walken  Reading the  Three Pigs

[02:41:30]  Cool  You can chill  How much paparazzi is outside?  They said they were out there for you  Yeah it's pretty bad  Crazy  It's not a bad thing  They want to see you  They want a picture  They want autographs  Nothing wrong with that  I saw you  I saw him in Vegas  At the Palms  Yeah  You're DJing  I've never seen anything like it  He's DJing  And it's around 5-6 deep of chicks  Nobody's on the floor  All the women of 5-6 deep  Surrounding the DJ booth  With their cell phones and cameras 
[02:42:00]  While he's got his headphones  He's working  He's got a job to do  He's trying to fucking mix records  Nobody's dancing  It's all them 5-6 deep  On all sides of him  Just holding cell phones up  And hot chicks too  Not just all fatties  There's a couple chunkies in there  But hot chicks  He's not paying attention to any of them  They don't care what he's spinning  He doesn't give a shit  And you're trying to wear a car  Like look  I really am into this spinning thing  And they don't even know  What's going on  I mean do you  I mean do you look up one time 
[02:42:30]  And just smile  And go thank you God  I do  I do  It's amazing though  It really is  Because I'm looking at these people  I'm like  What do they  They just want a picture  They're not paying attention to music  Like you said  But it's just amazing  That they all came there to see you  And win Vegas  I actually stood there too  I actually took my phone out  I was one of the girls  I was one of the 6th deep  One of the fat ones  I was the 10th deep  I don't think it's a bad problem to have  It's good  And it doesn't suck  To have the paparazzi  Following you around obviously  Yeah no not at all  I get sick of these celebrities  Like oh I can't take it anymore  They follow me wherever I go 
[02:43:00]  Oh no  That sounds like a pretty cool life  Yeah no it's cool  I don't mind it  I mean I really don't  It's all good  It's all positive  It's girls trying to get at you  I got no problem  With a beautiful woman  Taking my picture  I wanted my number  Or whatever  What was the first thing  That happened to you  After the show started  Where you realized  Like wow I'm famous  Because you're just a regular dude  And then all of a sudden  You're fucking  He's not a regular guy though  Look at him  No but I'm saying  As far as like  He did alright before Jersey Shore  He was one of the top ones  In the neighborhood  But you know what I'm saying  You know what I mean  Me and you were like  There was him  And then we  Him and then we were  At the bottom of the chain 
[02:43:30]  I mean that's a good question  From Jimmy  What were you doing  Before Jersey Shore  Then Jersey Shore hits  And then  Yeah  What was the first thing  That clicked  Where you're like  Oh wow this is massive  Yeah  Well there was a couple  Levels of it I guess  Because I was just a local DJ  In Rhode Island  I was DJing in my local state  And six nights a week  That's what I would do  I was in the car business  During the day  And DJing at night  And once the show aired  I took off for a month  And I got DJs to fill in for me  I filmed the show  And came back  And then the show aired 
[02:44:00]  And it was kind of cool  People would start to recognize you  And then just all of a sudden  Out of nowhere  It just like blew up  And then I couldn't go anywhere  By myself  Like I couldn't go to a normal  Can't go to the mall  And you couldn't do anything  By yourself  Because you would get swarmed  By too many people  And then the next level  I think it blew up even more  Is when it really clicked  And then like celebrities  Started to know who we are  And they want pictures with you  And that was amazing to me  Wow  Because here I am  Being a DJ my whole life  And now these artists  That I've been playing  Their music for  They want pictures with me  And they know who I am 
[02:44:30]  Wow  So that's what's  The craziest part about it  For me  How do you deal with that?  I mean it's all good  Especially like  The first time I went to Vegas  Like Rev Run was there  It was the first time  I was ever starstruck in my life  He called me on the microphone  He's like  Yo is that my boy Paulie D  And I was like  Come to the DJ booth  So I did  And I didn't even know what to say  I was like  He's like  I'm a big fan  He's like  God bless you  And I respect what you do  Fantastic  Are you the only one  Out of the group  That has like  Not to say that they don't  But a legitimate  Job career 
[02:45:00]  After the Jersey show  Like you DJ  Yes  Let's get a  You know  Good money to go to the Palms  And be the guy for the night  That's like a celebrity  Going there and DJing right  Are you the only one  Or the other people  Have jobs  Is it something that they do  No I think I'm the only one  That went in there with a job  That actually had like  Something to do  I think Paulie D  Will have a career  After Jersey Shore  In entertainment  Absolutely  Something about it  You got charisma man  Thanks man  And they're doing a spin off  Right  Yes  What's the spin off  So they picked him  The spin off is kind of like 
[02:45:30]  It's based on my lifestyle  Like kind of like  What it was before  And what happened  Because of the show  And then it follows my life  On tour now  Being a DJ  And I bring along  My friends from home this time  Instead of the people  That are on the show now  So it's like my lifestyle  And it's kind of like  Life on the road as a DJ  It's kind of a cool concept  That's terrific  Yeah  I watch Jersey Shore  I've seen every episode  What I like about you  Is like you don't  Take anything seriously  Yeah  You're still keeping it fun  Like holy shit  Look at us  We just get to party  And bring girls back  Yeah  And there's so much  Fucking drama in that house  All the time 
[02:46:00]  And it never phases you  You're just like  Ah whatever man  Who's up for partying  Because you're a fun guy  You know what  I get how serious it can be  Like we're getting paid  To party and have fun  Like I'm doing exactly  What I was doing before  Only now they're paying me for it  Right  And now they're sending me to Italy  Like I've always wanted to go to Italy  My whole entire life  Like that was one of the top ten things  I've always wanted to do  And now they sent us to Italy  They paid for it  Right  And then we lived there too  So how many people can say  That they actually lived in Italy  Like it was  It's all great things  I can't see the drama  I mean obviously  We get ourselves into some drama 
[02:46:30]  But  Yeah yeah yeah  That shit's funny to me  But you're like  The life of the party out there  Right  What was the toughest part  About being in Italy  Just the normal things  That you take for granted  Back home  Yeah  Like for us  It's gym tanning laundry  Sounds stupid  But like the gym was an hour away  Tanning didn't exist out there  And like the laundry  You had to walk all your laundry  To the laundromat  We didn't have a washer and dryer  Just the normal things  An hour away the gym was  Yep  They don't work out in Italy  No  Because they just walk around everywhere  Everybody was skinny  Even the clothes 
[02:47:00]  Like what's a medium to us  Is like an extra lodge to them  Really?  Yeah European clothes  They're fitted really  I fucking despise things  They love skinny jeans  H&M clothes  They're all European  They're thin torso  And that huge head hole  For their fat heads  Ronnie couldn't fit  In any of the clothes  Ronnie's a beast isn't he?  Yeah  Because I mean  The coming attraction  Of him knocking out  The situation  I would never want  Does he knock out  I never want to see  Fucking Ronnie's fist  Anywhere near me  That's gotta be  Fucking brutal 
[02:47:30]  Does he knock them out?  You gotta watch  You gotta watch  Well what they show  In the coming attractions  Tell us more about that  I mean  They had some built up anger  Throughout all the seasons  They never really  Really got along  They've always had  Some kind of like  Built up tension  Ever since day one  For some reason  Do you think it's a rivalry?  Maybe  But they just had to  Let it out that day  And they did  But you gotta see  How it really went down  Oh really?  Yeah  It's funny  It's funny?  Yes  You got me  It is hilarious  I still laugh at it 
[02:48:00]  I wouldn't like to be  Punched in the face  Not on TV  But it'd be even worse  If it was on television  And you knew  They weren't gonna  Exactly  That's why I wouldn't like it  Forever in reruns  I should be in your reality show  I should just be the guy  That kind of hangs out with you  And like whatever you say  I'll be like  Yeah that's right  I mean come on  My wingman  My new wingman  That's what's up  Believe me  You should be like  His little dog  Just jump on his lap  And tickle his neck  No I want to be the one  That like all the girls  That he won't bang  They're like  Could you get us?  I'll be like  I can introduce you to them  And then all of a sudden  They fucking drink out of my mule  Yeah the leftovers 
[02:48:30]  I got a lot of leftovers  What else is gonna happen this season?  Anything you could tell us  Or little teases or something?  Just this season was  I think it's gotta be  It's the most different season  Out of all  And probably the most drama  Because now there was drama  With the guys  Like you see  That Mike and Sitch stuff  But what happens is  We're in Italy now  A place we've never gone before  And we don't have any friends with us  No family  No nothing  We only have as each other  And then you're out there for two months  You kind of get sick of each other  So you'll see a lot of that  Built up anger  In the house  That drama  But still 
[02:49:00]  I still lay back  With my popcorn  And watch the movie  Did you get any Italian  Oh you already know  Was it different?  I'll tell you what  Did you like it?  I did  They're a little more reserved  Than the Jersey Girls  That was a little harder  And a language barrier  But I used that to my advantage  Yeah  You got a couple though?  Oh yeah for sure  Yeah  Yeah we did alright with the ladies  Did they know who you guys were  When you came?  They did  We had paparazzi out there  And people waiting outside our house  And stuff like that  For pictures and everything  But it's not as bad 
[02:49:30]  As it is in the States  Big hairy bushes?  Oh Jesus  Nah not at all  That's a fair question  I think that's old  Yeah that's old hat  Yeah  I was wondering that too  If they shaved it off  Yeah yeah yeah  If they're shaving down over there  But they do  Yeah that was one of the first things  I was wondering about  Do you like everybody still?  Yeah  I do  For the most part  For the most part?  For the most part  And you guys already filmed  Jersey Shore 4 right?  Back in Jersey?  Well 4 was Italy  We filmed 5 already  Oh you filmed 5 already too?  Yeah 5 we just filmed in Jersey  We went straight through  Oh  That was intense 
[02:50:00]  I wish Snooki would have tried to  Start Michael Corleone's car  She won't  Snooki won't do our show  Why is that?  I don't know  She's probably the publicist  They think we're going to be dicks  We've had just about all of you in  But Snooki just will not do our show man  Yeah I've seen that  She said that  You guys said that  We were all coming  Except for Snooki  I wonder why  Yeah we're nice enough guys  I think it's the publicist  She's probably being overprotective  Worrying we're going to be dicks  Are they trying to make her  Into something you think?  I just  I don't know if  Sometimes she maybe doesn't  Say the right things  Or something  I don't care 
[02:50:30]  We'd have fun with it  Whatever  That's what I say  It's fun  Hey Britney Spears  Yes  You warmed up for her?  Well I'm doing an actual act  So I do  I'm on tour with her right now  Right  And I do an act  Nicki Minaj is an act  And Britney is an act  So it's kind of like  I open for them both  Wow  How is Nicki Minaj?  Great  She performs like  Unbelievable  She puts on a show  I couldn't believe it  Is she nice to you off stage?  Really nice  Her whole camp too  Her whole camp was like  What's funny is  I did an opening set  And the crowd response  That I got was unreal  It was unreal right 
[02:51:00]  They heard it in the dressing room  And they're like  What is that noise?  They didn't know what was going on  So they came out  And they're like  God it must be my boy  Pulley D  That's what Nicki Minaj said  She came out  And said she'd never seen  A crowd response like that  In her whole entire career  And the fact that  She came out  And actually watched the whole set  She's like  This is the first time  I've ever done that  And Britney said the same thing  Wow  Do you sing?  What do you do?  Are you just DJing?  Are you actually  Are you singing?  What are you doing?  I DJ  And hype the crowd and everything  I got a song that I have released  I perform that song  From the booth  It's just kind of like  I just get the crowd hype  And get out of their seats  Fist pumping 
[02:51:30]  And stuff like that  How long was your set?  Like 40 minutes  Oh it's a long one  All right  All of these songs is good  God it's  I must say man  Thank you  We've played it on the show  A few times  Cool  And Britney gave you a lap dance  Yes  Because that's what they're  Talking about lately  In the trade  That was awesome  I love that none of this stuff  It still affects them  Like it would affect them  Yes  It was awesome  She's still hot  Be honest  She is  Yeah  She really is  We loved her when she was 17  We'll be honest  We used to have posters up  In our office and stuff  My favorite was the shaved head face  Because I'm like 
[02:52:00]  I had a shot at her then  I could have snuck in there  Both heads  Yes  You think if things were different  You probably could get it in  With Britney?  Maybe  I mean I don't know  She had a boyfriend I guess  No I know  That's what I'm saying  I guess if things are different probably  Yeah  Do you have vibes off her?  She's hot  And she can  She can work it  Does she drip the sex vibe?  She does  She's sexy  She's sexy  Did you guys hook up?  No we didn't hook up  Look at me  Yeah look at me  Look at Bobby  Did you hook up? 
[02:52:30]  No we didn't hook up  Look at me  Stay with me  Don't look away  Right here  Stay right here  Don't look away  I'm not looking at me  Stay right here  Don't look away  Bob's not trying to ask you a question  Bob's just in love with you  He wants to stare at you  We're not sure about Bobby  We think he might  Did you hook up?  Not at all  She's a friend  You know what  How about this  Since you got really famous  Any famous women?  Nothing too  You don't have to even name names  But you know  I mean nothing too 
[02:53:00]  A-list  There's a lot of like  B-listers  Yeah that come at you  And stuff like that  Kathy Griffin gave you a handjob  In a car  I don't discriminate  What list they're on though  It makes no difference to me  Right right right  I don't think I can handle  Famous women  I think I would have to blab  Or go on Twitter  That's one of the reasons  They would never sleep with me  So obviously it's physical  And you and Vinny are tight still right?  Yeah Vinny's my boy  Yeah Vinny is alright man  We have him on a lot  Yeah he's funny  I think he's coming in tomorrow  With his uncle  Oh cool  Is his uncle an alcoholic? 
[02:53:30]  Oh man  His uncle is a good time  He makes me laugh  I can't stop laughing  He just tells jokes 24-7  Yeah  He'll tell the joke  He'll be on the show  He'll tell the same exact joke  Remember them  Because he'll tell them again  At the end of the night  Oh yeah yeah  We know man  He brought in his  Shitty homemade wine  But we all drank it  And had a blast with him  We had Brooke Shields  She was drinking the wine too  Oh yeah  She had a glass  A plastic cup  And he took over the room man  And now I follow him on Twitter  Because it's the same shit  That wine sucked  One liners on Twitter  From Uncle Mirable  But they're all awful Rodney jokes 
[02:54:00]  But it didn't matter  It was still funny  I didn't get to try the wine yet  He gets so into it  He gets so into it  Stop sweating  Yeah he really  I think he was sweating  Like an animal  When he was just sitting there  Yeah  I didn't drink the wine  I don't drink  But I heard it was kind of like  Siphoning gasoline  Yeah  Yeah it was weird  It was like  It wasn't quite grape juice  But it wasn't quite wine yet  It was like  In that middle phase  Of just  Yuck  Are you sick at all  Not of Jersey Shore 
[02:54:30]  But of  Okay you're probably  From the show  Is that while you're doing  This other thing  You kind of want to  Branch out a little bit  No I just kind of want  People to see another side of me  Like I want them to see  Like what my passion  My heart  Like the music  And then I want to  Take along with my friends  And I'm like  I'm funny with my friends too  So I want them to see  That side of me as well  And I'll still do  The Jersey Shows though  As long as they keep coming  I'll still do them  What are your  How do your people react to you  That you grew up with  I'm sure they're happy for you  But is there anybody jealous  Or people who are kind of annoyed  Well I'll tell you what  The thing about fame is  They're like  Oh fame changes you 
[02:55:00]  I don't think so  I think it changes  The people around you  My friends act a little different  Oh  You know  Everybody's applauding  Yeah  Yeah because I'm so sick  Of hearing that  Oh man you changed  No I didn't  No I'm the same person  You can't handle it  For some fine reason  Exactly  Some of my friends  Can't handle it  So I mean  I love changing  You know what  Same person that doesn't  Call you anymore  But listen  No you find out  Who your friends really are  And you know what  Keep my circle real tight  And if you have any more  Friends than this  That's too many  That's what my father  Always said to me  Five yeah  That's what my mom said 
[02:55:30]  If you count your friends  On one hand  Consider yourself lucky  Yeah  You're from Rhode Island  What part of Rhode Island  You're from  I'm from Providence  Oh yeah  There's Cheetahs  I'm from Boston  Cheetahs  I love Boston  Yeah you guys are  Basically Boston  Yeah  I'm always  I'm in Boston  Right around  Exactly  Boston was so strong  To everything  Supposedly  They were  They were  And they had the best  Strip clubs  Because you could  You could touchy feely  Yeah  They went nuts there  Boston strip club  Is below  That two foot roll  Is fucking 
[02:56:00]  You don't have a motorcycle  Between you and the chick  It's awful  All the hot chicks  From Boston  Who were  You'd hang out  With their school teachers  They'd go to Rhode Island  To strip  Yep  Because people didn't go  They went to Boston  So I went there  So many times  And just girls I knew  From you know  High school or whatever  You know people  That you didn't think  Whatever strip  Are up on the stage  And they bend over  And see you between their legs  Oh no  Run off stage  I hope you tried to  Talk him out of that lifestyle  Bob  I sure did Jim  They're like  Don't tell my boyfriend  I work here 
[02:56:30]  Don't tell dad  I work here  Hey what's up  With Ronnie and Sammy  I gotta ask  A Jersey Shore question  It drives me fucking nuts  That these two  Will not move the fuck on  You too  They're in a party atmosphere  Being filmed for MTV  Yes  You know what  I don't get stressed  But they stress me out  Like I don't need  A relationship  I'm stressed out  Enough from theirs  Is she that insecure  That she can't move  The fuck on  Their relationship  There's nothing like it 
[02:57:00]  I've never seen it like it  I get how they met  On the show  It's whatever  There's cameras  There's that  The other thing  Nobody's relationship  Is filmed  But should they be together  Or should they not be  I have to vote  They should not be  And you thought  It was finally over  And then you know  You guys are in Italy  And it's obvious  That it's starting up again  Yep  And then me and Vinny  Were like listen  We don't want to ruin  This experience here in Italy  Please keep your relationship  To yourself  But that doesn't happen  Why does it get annoying  Because of the fighting  That comes with it  It's just ridiculous  It's over stupid things  Dude Ronnie destroyed  Sammy shit  What season was that 
[02:57:30]  That was awesome  It was amazing  It was amazing TV  And she's sitting there  With her broken glasses  Trying to figure out  What's next  Awesome  And then she dramatically  Leaves the house  And then you learn  If you pay close attention  She was only gone a day  It seems like  Maybe two days  But they make it seem  Like she was gone for a while  And then she comes back  And gets right back  Into the relationship  With the guy that destroyed  All her shit  Yep  I was like  When she was leaving  I was like  I know she'll be back  So I'm like  Listen Sammy  When you come back  Bring back paper towel  Or something  You know what I'm saying  And then when she walked 
[02:58:00]  In the house  I was like  Oh hey Sam  Like she didn't even leave  Really  Do you watch the show  Or do you not know  What they're going to edit  What's going to be on  Until it actually airs  For the rest of us  I watch it just before  You watch it  Because sometimes  We'll have to do  Like a reunion or something  But for instance  Like Italy  I've only watched up  To like the fifth episode  So I don't know  Exactly what they  What they aired yet  Or what  And are you surprised  How they edit it  And the stuff they leave out  I'm surprised  They leave out a lot of stuff  Yes  But they edit it  Just exactly how we are though 
[02:58:30]  There's nothing that they  Plant or they put things  In different order  Or anything like that  It's exactly how we are  I'm just surprised that  It takes 400 hours  To make one hour's episode  Right  So they do leave out  A lot of stuff  They love showing you guys  Drunk  Yes  That's the best stuff  But what's the down time  Is it just  You guys just sitting around  Fucking  Well down time  There's a lot actually  Because we have no television  No radio  No internet  No cell phones  Oh I didn't know that  So now you have like  Eight people in the house  So eight people  Two bathrooms  So the down time  Is like us waiting  On the couch 
[02:59:00]  Waiting for everybody  To get ready and stuff  I find myself  I'm always the first one ready  I sit on that couch for hours  Right  But they can't hear that  Because it's boring  How do you handle your  Not being able to tweet  In this world  Oh that's the hardest part for me  Is being off Twitter  And the second I got my Twitter  I was like  I must have blew up  Everybody's timeline  Because you know when I'm back  I'm like  I follow Vinny  You know  We're kind of  You know  He's a friend of the show  Whatever  I knew he was finally back  Because all of a sudden  Boom I'm back on Twitter  Yep  So how do you communicate  With each other  Do you have cell phones  And all you guys have 
[02:59:30]  Or do you have no phones whatsoever  No phones at all  Like we have a house phone  But everything's recorded  You know what I respect  About him though  Is that  I mean he's  He's a good looking guy  But he's  He'll hook up with  Like a five  You know what I mean  Like he hooks up with  A girl's eyes  Should be hooking up with  And he'll just bring him  In the bed  And giggle and laugh  And pull the covers up  In her German shepherd mall  On her back  Her shoulder blade  Will be showing  Her arm fat  Will be wiggling  As he pulls her  Under the cover  And turn into a vampire  With that said 
[03:00:00]  You don't really like Dina  Do you  I mean she's a friend  And that's all  Yeah right  Because they're  Playing that up  I was being nice  And she's a nice girl  Great girl  And with two single people  I mean casual stuff  Casual stuff  Whatever  She's a little frumpy  Come on let's be honest  With each other  She's a little frumpy  So you'll take a fat chick  Into the bedroom  With some fried dough  Just bring her in  We gotta wrap up  We're being told  All right  He's a busy man  Oh wow  What are we promoting  Paulie

[03:29:00]  Or maybe it's just  He did this a while ago  Before he's as famous  As he is  Well there's so many people in it  Yeah  And much more famous people  Than myself  No not really  Good old Roland  Exaggerated  Ensemble  Is what I'm getting at  Well you definitely  Should go see the movie  Spy Kids 4  No big year  Because I have a very  Small part in that  You might forget that  And Roland will be like  He's starring in a movie  It's going to be great  No Spy Kids 4  Yes  What is Spy Kids 4  What is it  Thanks for asking  The Weinstein people 
[03:29:30]  Are out there like  What's he going to say about it  It's the reboot of the series  Nice  Oh reboot  Yeah  It's not  But they  Yeah it's the big budget  And  Isn't one of the original  Kids in it though  Like  Yeah  Kind of  She's all grown up  And looks terrific  Yeah that's kind of  A weird thing  It's disturbing  Yeah it must be  She looks great  And at the premiere  She was wearing a very  Wonderful provocative  Top  And you're like  How long ago was that  First movie  Jesus Christ  Was that  In the 60s  Late 90s  Yeah  She's like 23 now 
[03:30:00]  It's crazy  The kids now are great  It's  Yeah I mean  It's a family movie  There's way less profanity  Right  What's it rated  It's rated  PG-13  No it's  No I think it's G  Oh is it a G movie  I think it is  It's probably PG  There's probably some  Like soft violence  There's yes  There's  Slapstick  There's  You know the kids do  Well what's his name  Ricky Gervais is playing a dog  Yeah  Oh Ricky Gervais  That shoots things out of its butt  Okay see  Butt bombs  That makes kids laugh right there 
[03:30:30]  Yeah so it's a kids movie  And it's a great way to bring your family  Yes  Out to the movies  Family out to the movies  And my kids refuse to go into the premiere  So  Why  I don't know  Well no because they were three  They're three and six  And you force a three year old to go in  Oh yeah that's going to be a problem  Yeah but now they're asking to see it  And I was like you had a chance  Now this is a 4D  4D  Smell-o-vision  How is that?  Well  They give you a paper  And then a thing will come up on the screen  You rub it  And 
[03:31:00]  Scratch and sniff  Scratch and sniff  And then there's a smell  So  Even the dog bombs from the ass?  Very  I think that happens  I would love to know how they make that smell  Yeah my character smells like lavender when he comes on the screen  Oh lavender  It's very nice  That is not  Is it a cartoon or no?  It is not a cartoon  No  It's Robert Rodriguez  The same guy who did  Fuck really?  You know machete  And  He created that series  Yeah he created the series  That was one of the reasons why  Yeah he's great 
[03:31:30]  Good interview  You should see his  He has a compound  He took over the old Austin airport  Wow  So everything  Like Sin City  He goes  Like we're in this huge warehouse  That he turned into a movie studio  And he's like  That's where we shot  In this corner  He's just like  Yeah that's where we shot Sin City  Like in a little tiny corner  Just the corner  Oh he shoots everything there  Yeah he invented that look  That you know eventually  You know 300 did  And that comic book look  Comic book  It's amazing  Yeah CGI  You don't need a big place to do it in 
[03:32:00]  No  You don't need a giant chasm to defend  Yeah  What's the  Is it all through CGI that he does it?  For  Well there's a ton of CGI in this  But for like Sin City  It's the whole  The whole thing is  Hardly anything is shot in the world  It's all  It's all done afterwards  And that look  That was a cool movie  Remember that  When you first saw it  We were like how did they do that?  Who's in that?  I never saw it  Mickey Rourke  Oh yeah I heard of it  Bruce Willis in that one  Yeah everybody's  Everyone's in 
[03:32:30]  And then of course also  Jessica Alba was in it  Dust Till Dawn  Dust Till Dawn was great too  Great movie  He directed that one  And then what is it?  The Tarantino  What was the Tarantino one?  Oh yeah  Planet Era  The three movies  And he did El Mariachi  Did you ever see that?  Yeah I heard of it  And the Spy Kids movies  Desperado  And the Spy Kids movies  That have made him  Which is hilarious  Now he can buy Texas  Yeah that's like  Some of his biggest grossing  And he writes it  And then he'll sit at his monitor 
[03:33:00]  Playing the guitar  And he goes  Oh yeah  I'm writing the  He's like I'm writing the soundtrack right now  What do you think of this?  And I'm like  That's great  Edits it  Mr. Genius  Yeah he's like  He's like  Good guy  Does he play just music or sing?  He plays music  I think he does sing  But he doesn't sing on the soundtrack  That's great  He's like Louis  Just fucking does everything  And saves money  Smart that way  Yeah  Louis even  So does Rourke  He edits it  Yeah edit it yourself  Does he have final say  Or does the studio?  I think he is so powerful  That he kind of  He's at that point  That would be odd though  To edit your own shit 
[03:33:30]  You know  You kind of fall in love  With everything I guess  Yeah you have to be able to  Make a long ass movie  Every shot  Perfect  I nailed it again  I fucking nailed it  It's a 12 hour movie  Even though we did three takes  I want all three takes in it  But it's going to be weird  You're just doing the same thing  Over and over again  Perfect  Okay  We'll put it in  But I don't think the kids  Are going to understand it  I'm the editor  Damn it  How have you guys been?  Good  Good  Yeah for the most part  You know  They've stuck us here  Still here  They keep  It's musical studios with us 
[03:34:00]  Yep  And you guys  They get smaller and smaller  Like I always say  I'd complain but who'd listen  I say that often  And Jimmy and I  We were on the Leno show  Last week together  Yes we were  That was a fun night  Jay  Yeah  Yeah  Yes  I just  No yeah  Doing that for no reason  Phil Leno  Phil Leno  Yes  Jay's cousin  He does the show on Discovery  That was a good bit  Yeah it was  That was the first time  They did that  Coulda woulda shoulda  Yeah  The gay stylist 
[03:34:30]  That I brought with me  His name's Jose  He was  As he was watching the bit  He goes  That little one is very funny  Oh  Thank you  It's funny  I've never considered  The little one  I liked it a lot  And he recognized you  Yeah  Wayne  From  I didn't even know  You were there  That's Bobby Kelly  Yeah he's blending in over there  Do you guys know  We don't blend in  No we don't  You're blending in  Because all the TV's black  You're wearing the black shirt  Yeah  Yeah  Camouflage 
[03:35:00]  Bobby's a comedian  Right on Bobby  Certainly  He really is  Are you a Boston fan  Yeah  Okay  How long have you been acting  Well I got to LA in 2000  And I got this  I was doing a lot of commercial  I couldn't get an agent  And then I started doing commercials  Because I had a commercial agent  And then eventually got the soup  So as far as being in LA 10 years  But then the first play I did was  It's a small world in Haddonfield, New Jersey 
[03:35:30]  Wow  It really was  It was a kids show based on the Disney ride  Wow  Worst Disney ride ever too  How dare you  It was terrible  Oh god  Once you're through the first curve  You know the whole ride  And then you realize  It's like the Amazon  Just goes forever  And that song keeps going  Over and over again  And they're the same  Little robot guys  With just different clothes on  Yeah  Anyway  You know  Oh look we're in China  It looks  Yeah  It looks just like the little Mexican kids 
[03:36:00]  Yeah  But they're in Chinese clothes  And then you go around the turn  Oh look  We're in Hawaii  And they got little skirts on  And they're doing a little dance  And then you  And you're just sitting there going  Oh  I remember  They actually  Okay  Again  Bringing up my age  No offense here  But  Why would she be offended by your age?  Because she doesn't go out with older guys  We found that out today  And I figured she had a great relationship with her father  And I was right  Go figure that one out  She doesn't want to date somebody older than Al Lewis  I was at the New York World's Fair 
[03:36:30]  Not the one in the 30s  It was in the early 60s  And they showed off the horseless carriage  I couldn't believe it  It was amazing  We saw  Yeah  The steam engine  How old was she in 1962?  How many years did you have to go before you were even born?  You gotta ask how old her parents were  Even if her parents were even born then  87  Does someone have a gun?  87  So while you were at the World's Fair  She still had 25 years to go before she was born 
[03:37:00]  That's right  While you were on your high school date  I wasn't on my high school date  I was being pushed in a little carriage  Because I was a wee little lad  I was a baby at the time  And my father took me into this stupid  It's a small world  Because it was set up there  At the World's Fair  And he said  Like a couple of years later  He's like  Oh yeah  You went into that  At the World's Fair  And I was like  Oh I don't remember  He goes  Yeah you were crying  Oh no  And then I go  Why would I be crying 
[03:37:30]  And then he goes  Oh because you thought it was  I guess so beautiful  Like no  That isn't it  You don't think that was it?  No  You were scared?  I was bored shitless  And probably scared  I was always crying as a kid  Wait your dad said  It was because you  Oh I think you thought it was beautiful  Yeah yeah  I think he was trying to make me feel better  That is  Then this sunset happening  You're just like  It's the most beautiful thing  A kid isn't going to cry  Because something's beautiful  You haven't figured that out yet  No that has  No  No  I was scared  Nothing to compare it to  Little fucking monstrous children 
[03:38:00]  Singing that song  You loved it  It was so beautiful  You cried  It was beautiful  I often would read poetry to you  When you were first at home  Yes yes  I remember the first time  I read Yeats  Really dad?  What happened?  When you're a kid  Anything beautiful  You want to ruin  You want to break it  Of course you want to break it  Or set it on fire  That's it  Hyman's  Kill it  What?  See  I got all out of whack here  You know  We're here for his PG movie  I was going to say  Speaking of kids  Spike Kits 4  Of course  When does it come out? 
[03:38:30]  Friday?  This Friday  Yeah  This Friday  We did swear a lot on set  And the kids would make us pay for it  Every time we did  Really?  How much?  It was a little curse jar  Well it was always being negotiated  It was always 10 bucks or 20 bucks  Wow  If we swore  Curses are expensive  These days  Yeah those kids were  Yeah they're good  They knew our lines  Backwards and forwards  Who got the money?  Their parents?  Robert Rodriguez  It's amazing  I'm taking a fun moment  Making a literal  Financial question out of it  I really am an asshole  What did you invest it, Joel?  What's the end of the story, jerk? 
[03:39:00]  I'm just a fool  What happened with  Yeah  It comes out this Friday  How long have you been doing  The soup now, Joel?  Since 2004  You still love it?

[03:39:30]  I have fun doing it  And it's a steady gig  It's a funny, funny show  Yeah that's how we bonded  The first time you were in  We hated Tyra  And you went after Tyra  We went after Merciless  Who are you going after these days?  Well I actually  Any favorites?  We  Well we  We went  I was at the Teen Choice Award  The Teen  Whatever  But the Kardashians  And Tyra  Were on the red carpet  At the same time I was  So that was like  Being in a minefield  Yeah  Yeah  Of hairspray  Did they say anything to you?

[03:41:30]  The little girl  Was shaving the stomach  Of her step grandpa  Why?  And  Well that's a very good  But she had the electric razor out  And was shaving right  As we said on the soup  Right up  In his upper pubes  And  Because it scratches her forehead  And we were like  We were like  Step grandpa  Shaving his belly  And the mom is going like  Come on get in there

[03:45:00]  God damn  And also  There's so much  To talk about with Joel  Congratulations on community  Holy shit  Thanks man  I think we asked you  Last time  But did you expect it  To be as big  As it became  Well  I'm waiting for it  To be really big  It's doing fine  Yeah it's doing  I mean for  Our time slot  Which is 8 o'clock  On Thursdays  Premiering September 22nd  Nice  Much like Spy Kids  This August 19th  Friday  Nice  But  We're up against  NFL football  And now the X Factor 
[03:45:30]  And American Idol  And all that  But despite that  Thankfully  And we just added  John Goodman  To the cast  RT's going to do a bunch  And then  Michael K. Williams  From The Wire  We love him  He is playing  An ex-con biology teacher  And he is  We were doing these takes  And they were just like  That's  As good and scary  As we want  He's just playing  As scary  He's great man  Yeah he's really good  Very intimidating  And now he's on  Boardwalk Empire  Were you a Wire fan? 
[03:46:00]  Huge Wire fan  Yeah absolutely  I couldn't believe  He was there  Yeah  I mean I was like  We got him  How do we get him?  Who?  We tricked him  Yeah so  We're coming back  For the third season  And I can't believe it  If you've been on The Wire  We want you in here  Simple as that  Yeah  Especially Jimmy  Especially Jimmy  Yeah  I was on The Wire  Huh?  I'm kidding  I'm a fan of the show  Zero  That show never got  An Emmy nomination  No  I think in season 5  It got one  Writing nomination 
[03:46:30]  I believe  I could even be wrong  About that  But it doesn't surprise me  That they just  Fucking nominated  The white guy  They really stink  Hollywood  They stink  That show was  Amazing  It's amazing  That it was  How it went  I mean it was crazy  How did Wendell Pierce  Not get nominated  As Bunk  Or  If you want to say  Michael K. Williams  Or even the guy  Who played Bodie  Or any of these guys  Or fucking Bobs  Andre Roy  How did they not  Get nominated for acting  And the way they shot it  The way it looked  And I was like 
[03:47:00]  How did you do it  He's like  Most of the time  You saw those  Scary places  That's as scary  It was just  It was really scary  Yeah  They shot those  The projects right  Yeah  And was Baltimore  Happy about it  I don't know if it brought  I can't imagine  Yeah brought tourism  This is great  Come to Baltimore  A crappy place  See our slums  The bad guys are bad  And the good guys  Are worse  Yeah  Remember when Miami Vice  Kind of changed  Miami  Like they brought in  Huge tourists  Wasn't that funny  Just being like  We're trying to stop  Cocaine runners 
[03:47:30]  Come on in  Great  Hey you're the longest  Running soup host  You are right  Yeah  How long did Kinnear  And how long did  Henson have it  Kinnear did it  From I think  91 to 94 or 5  That old that show  Yeah it premiered  Show's 20 years old  Yeah  When that  It's already  I think  Or maybe it was 1990  It might be 21  Fuck  And when he started  That was the first  Cause it's still  At that point  Cable was  In it's pioneer days  There was no  No one would buy  Commercials on it  So they would cut away 
[03:48:00]  To two minutes  Of promos  For other e-shows  And then go back  Come back  And he put it on  He put it on the map  Wow  And then Henson did it  For five years  And then Aisha Tyler  Did it for a few years  I forgot she did it  All right  And Hal Sparks  Did it for a couple  Of years  But it was cancelled  In 2002  The Daily Show  It was a daily show  And it was mostly  About talk shows  And then in 2004  They brought it back  As a weekly show?  Yeah cause it was  Talk soup  Yes  Oh right  But the Daily Show  Started going away  A lot of those shows  Started kind of 
[03:48:30]  There was not as many  Talk shows  Like remember when it was  There was  Ricky Lake  And the daughter  From the Cosby show  Had her own show  Everyone had a talk show  Yeah everyone had one  How do you get the rights  To the clips  If you're gonna fuck  With the shows?  You can use anything  In the first  We can use  It's something like  20 seconds  Or 30 seconds  Of the first week  It airs  For free  Wow  Cause it counts  Cause we count  Technically as a news show  But after that  Then you pay for it  And we don't  We don't show it  So wait  You'll only show  The first week  Something airs? 
[03:49:00]  That's  Well that  You have to pay for it  After that  So for specials  And things  We pay for the clips  And so  What if they don't want you  To make fun of their show  And they don't want to  Sell it to you?  Then we can't show it  Oh they  Okay so you have that too  Right?  Yeah I think we've had  That problem  But most shows  Loved it  Yeah they love the exposure  Just being odd  Right  Yeah  I mean toddlers  And tiaras  You see what they run  Yeah go ahead  Yeah go ahead  Fuck it  So yeah  Yeah that's the rule  So  What do you think of 
[03:49:30]  All this shit  On true TV  There are now like  Literally four towing shows  I know  On true TV  I was watching it  It's crazy  I was watching something  Last night  On there  Oh some police chase  Fucking shit  Same one from like 94  Yeah  I think I've seen the same  Police chase show  Over and over again  Yeah  Yeah they're great  You know  And the pit maneuver  And then  I just can't believe  There's  I mean  They say it was like  We are in the golden age  Of TV shows  About storage units  About storage units 
[03:50:00]  There's so many shows  And tow trucks  Yeah  It's crazy  And now I realize  It's literally  Four different shows now  Different locations  Of phony towing  Like no one's telling me  Any of this shit is real  I also do  Have you seen  Bait Car  Yeah  Oh yeah  Bait Car's good too  Yeah  Yeah  That's  I'm surprised  No one's had a heart attack  On that  Yeah  Yeah  Doors lock  And the thing  It's like  Oh hell  Oh hell  I knew it  And like  Oh we got you  But if I see 
[03:50:30]  One more of those  Big burly guys  You know  The tats  And the shaved head  During the promo  Come out  In the corner  Of the show  You're watching  Fold his arms  And nod his head  Do they all do that?  They all do that  Whether they're  At a pawn shop  Or making cakes  Or raising pit bulls  Make that mean face  Shake another head  And fold their arms  They usually have a goatee  Yeah yeah  A goatee  And a little scowl  Yeah  Apparently  Those are the biggest stars 
[03:51:00]  In television  Huge  And now Hulk Hogan's  Got a new show  Coming out  What a surprise  With midget wrestlers  Oh god  Seriously?  Yes  It's called micro  I want to sleep  With my daughter  What is it?  Christ  Dad  What is it called?  Micro  Chimps or something  Micro championship  Yeah  And it's midget wrestling  Yeah  Wow  Hulk Hogan hosting  Midget wrestling  Because nothing went bad  With his family  That first time  No  I disagree Joel  Really?  No  Because 
[03:51:30]  I honestly  Think it's very rare  You get a show like  Community  Where there's writing  And acting  Good characters  And good characters  And good stories  Thank you  That is such a  Just a thing of the past  And you got guys  Like I know some  Talented people  Not in this room  But I know some  Talented people  That have pitched shows  Yeah  And gotten nothing back  And I know they're  Creative and talented  And funny people  With great ideas  And then you see 
[03:52:00]  Four tow truck shows  Right  Or you go like  I found a lady  That eats couches  Yeah  That was my strange addiction  A lady that eats couches  She's like  She should be on TV  Yeah she's foam rubber  And it really just  The disillusionment  With the  Especially network television  Wow  Well the effort  To put into  Making a quality show  Is a tremendous  Amount of effort  And for reality shows  Are so profitable  And so you can  Make them for nothing  You have to pay people  A lot of money  Like how you do  Actors  I mean  They don't have quotes 
[03:52:30]  Yeah  Fucking reality people  It's so hard to like  But people like  A well acted  God bless them  Story  Yeah  If it's good  And it works  Then it can  It can be really  Successful  I have a technical  Question about community  What kind of  I've asked you before  I think  What kind of camera  Do you guys use  Because when I  I've seen that  The way it is shot  And whatever the  Camera quality is  No it looks  I said no  Well we actually use  It literally is  This amazingly clear  It looks different  Than anything else on TV  That 
[03:53:00]  God bless you  For saying that  But it does  Because they  Because so many comedies  Now are the  Documentary style  Where they use  Real lighting  Or they don't have  Many lighting setups  And they have  All confessionals  Letting you know  What the backstory  You know  What they're thinking  In the next scene  Coming up  But they did  They wanted to do  The opposite  And make it look  Like a movie  Every shot  And so they  Take great care  In making sure  Everything looks pretty  And which means  I never see my family  Because the hours  Are really long  Yeah it's got to be  But we've shot  A couple episodes  On the Canon 5D 
[03:53:30]  The  Right right  The SLR camera  I mean  Really  You see this  Tiny little camera  With a $30,000 lens  And  But they don't play  And I mean  Or record  It's crazy  Oh that's  The lens obviously  And there's a 7D too  Which they heard  The 5D is still  Better than the 7D  The video  I think now  The 7D is  Right up there  But the video  And it's just like  An SLR  Yeah you can buy  Yeah  You can buy them  Without the lens  For like $3,000  Yeah  Which I mean  A Panavision movie camera 
[03:54:00]  Is  You can't even  You can't buy them  They're worth  So much money  Like $100,000  But you can shoot  A movie on the 5D  You can't  And they  Yeah  But you just  They shoot all of house  On the 5D  Oh do they  But you can't turn quickly  Or something with them  Right  They don't have  What is it  That they don't do well  You can't follow them  Yeah  I think the motion with them  They go out of focus  Very quickly  Or very easily  Yeah by the way  This is exactly how  Somebody who's not in show business  Describes a camera  You know  They look not as good  Or whatever  Cloudy 
[03:54:30]  Yeah  Fucking idiot I am  We  Yeah  And now  And nothing is shot on film anymore  It's all shot on  Digital  Yeah so much easier  To edit that way  And you don't have  And you're much cheaper  Dump it into Avid  Or Final Cut Pro  Which one would you use  Final Cut Pro  Okay I see  That's what I use  Really  Okay  When I do my  You know  Video  When you edited your documentary  Yes  About crying  At the beauty  Of the small world  For the first time in your life  I think I did  Cooking a Chicken in a Bag  And I did 
[03:55:00]  A cheesy sitcom  Cheesy sitcom intro  See you could pitch a show  Right now  Called Cooking in a Bag  Cooking in a Bag  And you would  It would be on the  Cooking Network  Fuck man  We love it  It's like cooking food  But it goes in a bag first  You should do it as a goof  And you cook it in a bag  See what they do  I did  I had the whole thing  Those cooking shows  The competitions  They're sitting there eating  They're like  Oh my gosh  I don't know  I think I blew the flambet  And they're sitting there  And they're like  Taking bites of it  And they look up  And you're like  You son of a bitch 
[03:55:30]  Yeah  What are you trying to do  To my mouth right now  Get out  I don't know  Maybe just remake it  I was watching a show  Not a show  Just a show  A marathon  I think I got through  Three episodes  Before I actually  Smacked myself  Into what the  What are you doing  Coupons  It's a show  About people  Extreme couponing  That clip coupons  Extreme  It's extreme couponing  They clip coupons  Go to the grocery store  Chalk up like  A couple of thousand dollars  Worth of groceries 
[03:56:00]  And literally pay  Two dollars for it  If that  Sometimes they actually  Get a gift card back  For sixty bucks  And leave with just  Piles of food  That they've paid  Nothing for  But they're  These anal retentive  Women  Clipping coupons  Lining up all the stuff  They bought on the shelves  In their basements  With the labels  Perfectly facing forward  They're organized hoarders  Is what they are  They're hoarding  Food  But they're very organized  And  They have lives  They're very attractive  Very attractive 
[03:56:30]  They have big families  The checkout  Those are the people  I feel bad for  The people at the checkout  Because it takes  About an hour and a half  To two hours  They said  To check these people out  Really?  Yeah  Because everything has to be done  In separate carts  Because you're only allowed  So much of one thing  On one coupon  And the husbands  Have to be the most  Pussy whipped asses  I've ever seen  They're there  Pushing around  Yes dear  Loading in cards  How many of these  Do we need?  157 deodorants  And they're dumping 
[03:57:00]  In 157 deodorants  And that's a show  On TV  And that's a god damn show  Yeah  And we're trying to  Yeah  And we're trying to  Find something good  To pitch  And do community  And put together  Intelligent  Funny  Well acted  Coupons  Let's cook some chicken  In a bag  It's going to be great  Coupons  What happened to John Henson?  He is a host  On Wipeout  And I think he's a producer  Of it on ABC  And I think he's  Producing a Steven Soderbergh movie  Or helping produce it

I'm telling you  You should find it  It's unbelievable  They had to do some  Crazy shit on that one  Yeah  They didn't care if  Those people got killed  I was convinced  A few people broke their necks  Japanese people  They had to die on TV  We don't care  It really is insane  What you can get away with  Over there  That would be just  Litigated here  In a second  In a second  Just scaring the shit  Out of old people  To the point where  You don't know if they died  No  They could have just  Dropped dead  And everybody's like  Oh  And they show people like  Oh 
[03:58:30]  Laughing  A bear trap  In the street  The game show  Where they would put  Girls' heads in a box  A clear box  But they'd be like  Snakes  And spiders  Yeah  Spiders  And they're screaming  And they're afraid of it  And they open up  But they're stuck in the thing  And they're just screaming  And people are just dying  And they never let them out  The hostess go  No  They're literally white  And screaming  Yes  I think it was called  Why would you agree to this  They're the best prankers ever though  The Japanese are the best prankers

Extra strength right guard?  Alright guys  Paving tar in his armpit  I just drowned an intern with my armpit  There's an inside question  Did you write any jokes for Roland?  No  He lies about everything

I don't remember this  Do you remember Sam?  I think he said the first one  Whatever that was  Because he did very well on the stage  Yeah I think you texted me  And then it came out that you wrote for him  I think it came out that  You might have texted me that you killed  No
