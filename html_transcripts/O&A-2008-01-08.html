<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion of the 2008 Presidential primaries, focusing on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.  This included speculation on the potential impact of an Obama presidency on Black America, analysis of a seemingly emotional moment from a Clinton campaign event, and detailed discussion of a prank pulled by the Toucher & Rich show, where they interrupted a Clinton rally shouting "Iron my Shirt."  Audio of both the rally interruption and a subsequent communication from a Toucher & Rich host were played.  A guest, Tom Chiasano, participated in a debate about Tiger Woods' impact on golf, specifically whether his skill or race was more significant in his rise to fame.  This discussion included a recounting of a racist joke told by Fuzzy Zoeller about Tiger Woods.  The show also featured a "FU Line" segment with angry listener messages, a slogan contest for the show, and discussion of comedian Patrice O'Neal's upcoming appearance on Def Comedy Jam and Opie's dislike of O'Neal's hat.  Tony Romo's dating life and its perceived negative effect on his football performance were also discussed. Opie shared a potentially dangerous snorkeling experience with sharks in the Bahamas.

The broadcast continued with a discussion of lax parasailing safety standards in foreign countries, contrasted with stricter American regulations. Listeners called in with their own anecdotes about risky travel experiences, including snorkeling with aggressive fish, a parasailing incident resulting in a woman losing her top, and a tiger-petting experience.  The show then returned to the "Iron My Shirt" theme, showing a video of two men, Adolfo and an Opie and Anthony intern, being ejected from a Hillary Clinton rally for shouting the phrase.  A presidential candidate poll on WQAD.com was used as a comedic segment, leading to humorous moments, including a misunderstanding of "Jimmy Tied" as a candidate's name, and the revelation that the website suggested Duncan Hunter as a candidate for Anthony.  The segment included a studio guest, Rich Voss, but the discussion focused largely elsewhere.  A "bleeped" version of "The Count" song from Sesame Street with the expletive "fuck" replacing "one" was played.  Further discussion of the Roger Clemens press conference and a phone conversation between Clemens and his trainer was included, along with Harvey Levin of TMZ providing commentary on the Britney Spears situation. The success of a "Google bomb" promoting "Jimmy Tide 08" was also noted.


The show further explored the humorous misunderstanding of "Jimmy Tide" from the WQAD.com poll.  Opie and Anthony, along with Jim Norton, recounted Howard Stern's first mention of their show, comparing their initial excitement to the panicked reaction of another radio personality, Dave Dickless.  The conversation then shifted to financial investments and Norton's investment strategies.  Rich Voss and his baby daughter, Reyna, along with Bonnie (presumably Rich's partner), appeared as studio guests.  The segment heavily featured discussions about Rich's anxieties over Reyna's paternity, his offer of a DNA test as a Christmas gift, and humorous anecdotes about his parenting style.  The baby's presence led to jokes about breastfeeding and her reactions to the hosts.  A significant portion involved watching and reacting to the video "Two Girls, One Cup," with detailed descriptions of its graphic content including defecation and vomiting, and eliciting various reactions from the hosts and Bonnie.  Bill Burr called in to share his own reaction to the video.  E-Rock's confession about stealing food from the office kitchen was also mentioned.

The final segment featured a phone call with Bill Burr, discussing his move to Los Angeles before the writers' strike, its impact on his TV show prospects and auditions, and his experiences with picket lines.  The conversation touched upon the strike's effects on television and movies, including late-night shows, and the challenges faced by comedians.  The segment also included a humorous, sexually explicit discussion of a pancake promotion idea pitched to Tom Chiasano, involving the hosts and Burr penetrating pancakes with their erect penises.  This culminated in a call with Chiasano where the idea was jokingly presented as a serious proposal.  Opie recounted a bizarre encounter with Steve Buscemi, and an update on Rich Voss's progress in a Comedy Central online contest was given.  A morbidly humorous song about a death from an overdose was also played.  Beyond Roland, there were no other notable studio guests.  The segment maintained a largely irreverent and comedic tone with frequent use of vulgar language and sexually explicit jokes.  The entire broadcast was characterized by a rapid-fire style, frequent shifts in topic, and liberal use of offensive language and sexually explicit humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  What happened to your socks?  I don't know what happened.  Oh my god!  Mass Mass BOUGHT!  His skin is completely black.  Oh my god!  This isn't where entertainment is going.  Oh my god!  Roland's gotta paddle.  Oh, my God, Rollin' is kicking Dave's ass. 
[00:01:00]  Who saw this coming?  They are sick freaks.  One, two, three, go.  B-Rock is a ten-  Give us a thumbs up if you're all right.  Shut up.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hi.  Good morning, Boston. 
[00:01:30]  Ooh.  What?  Came out of nowhere.  Big good morning to everyone listening on BCN in Boston.  Nice.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ready for broadcast.  Ready for action.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Make sure you write down onaradio.com.  Steve did a great job on the show Rundown yesterday. 
[00:02:00]  Yes.  And I point people in that direction because, you know, we bring up a lot of visual things.  And we put it all on that website for you so you can see what we're talking about.  Yeah, because some people go, well, I can't see it.  Like yesterday, we were talking about Hillary Clinton's old man lips.  And there it was on onaradio.com later on in the day.  Yeah.  There you go.  And the new Coke Logic video's up there.  It's the return of Tippi Tom. 
[00:02:30]  The animation is called.  You can check that out as well on onaradio.com.  And I just want to breathe.  That's all I ask.  Oh, all you were doing in the office was blowing gobs of snot into tissues.  It's so frustrating.  It must be.  Because now that it's spring, you know, I don't want to have the flu anymore.  It's going to be, what, 65 degrees today in New York?  Yeah.  How's that global warming working out for everybody?  Just a bizarre turn of events. 
[00:03:00]  That's fine.  Because now you get all the environmentalists going, see?  But then, you know, a week from now, it'll be 15 degrees or something.  But they also say that the cold is part of it, too.  You know, everybody that was like, well, it's freezing cold.  It's really cold in some of the parts of the country.  Well, that's global warming, too.  Yeah.  You just don't understand it.  You don't understand that it also just screws up weather patterns.  So some places get cold and some places get too warm. 
[00:03:30]  Well, tell China to turn the heat down.  China is not listening to anybody.  They are their own people.  They are shoveling coal into old, like, coal-fired generating systems for their power.  Yeah.  And they really don't care.  No.  And Iran is right behind them.  Yeah.  Right behind them.  Well, they're not trying to drive little boats into our aircraft carriers and whatnot.  It's our massive aircraft, nuclear aircraft carriers. 
[00:04:00]  Could you please just stop that old gag?  It worked once with the coal when they were tied up at the dock.  And that was because it was a ridiculous situation that we had to deal with over there.  Where the hell was that docked?  Yemen.  Yeah.  Remember Yemen?  Yemen.  And even the security guys on the deck weren't allowed to carry a sidearm.  Yeah.  That's how bad it was at that time. 
[00:04:30]  So the little Zodiac just came pulling up and it was full of explosives and blew up the coal.  Right.  Did we have a situation last night?  Yeah.  They were very close to shooting this Iranian little speedboat.  Apparently, they were in front of one of our ships and threw boxes out into the water in front of the ship, which had to then take some evasive maneuvers.  And then they were saying something over a loudspeaker system like, we will come at you and blow you to pieces. 
[00:05:00]  And they locked, loaded, got ready to fire.  They were seconds away from just blowing this little Iranian boat out of the water and the boat turned around and left the scene.  And our boat is in the area to make sure the oil flows freely through that strait, right?  The straits of Hormuz.  Yeah.  What, 16 or 17 percent of our oil comes from that strait?  Yeah.  So we got to keep that pretty clear.  It has to go through that strait.  So we have to have a little interest in that area. 
[00:05:30]  But those idiots in that boat almost got blown.  They don't even know how close they came to being blown to bits.  Right.  And what's their problem?  They just don't want us in the area?  They're Iranian.  Making sure our oil goes through there?  Yeah.  They wanted to make some problems, I think.  Wow.  This is an exciting time to live your life.  It's just turmoil everywhere.  No one knows what's going to go on with the presidential election here in this country. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, no one knows what's going to go on?  Oh.  Obama!  Oh, don't say it.  I'm living in the year 2008.  Anthony's living in the year 1958.  No, I'm not.  Oh, Obama!  Bang-a-dang-a-dang-a-ding-a-dong-ding.  Blup-blup.  Blup-blup.  Clinton doesn't even have a shot anymore.  Well, I say good for that because I certainly wasn't for her.  She's way behind the polls, right?  Yeah.  As the New Hampshire thing is upon us? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Are they voting today?  Are they doing their straw poll or whatever the hell they do?  Look, I don't know what ridiculousness this primary is, but I think 11 people voted.  It's this archaic system of its tradition and stuff, so they have to do it.  Yeah.  But it's like they go, and Rudy Giuliani gets one vote.  Like one guy up there went, hey.  One guy that didn't have to work.  Yeah.  And then the Democratic side. 
[00:07:00]  It was like, and Barack Obama gets seven votes in the world.  Woo!  And then they break it up into percentages on the TV screen like there's millions of people  voting.  But it was seven people.  Well, there's only like 12 that are allowed to vote.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Yeah.  Something ridiculous like that.  Something really stupid.  They start voting at midnight, and Clinton's not going to win that primary.  No.  Obama, it seriously looks as if Obama is gaining a lot of momentum on that Democratic ticket. 
[00:07:30]  Get me some Obama audio.  Oh, God.  I want nothing but Obama audio.  I did have a theory, since this is getting a little scary, that Obama may actually pull  this off.  As far as the Democratic ticket goes, I don't know if he's going to beat a Republican.  I just don't know.  It's all very mysterious at this point.  But I did have a little idea that maybe, and you probably don't expect this out of me, 
[00:08:00]  maybe some good could come out of Obama being the President of the United States of America.  You better say it exactly how you said it in the office.  Why?  Oh, my God.  I'm the only one that's going to understand what you're about to do here.  No.  You're going to say this a little differently than you did 15 minutes ago in the office.  Perhaps.  I'm going to start taping in the office.  I'll try to use the Queen's English.  You can't get away with this crap anymore.  Yes, I can.  Let's see how you clean it up for the airwaves. 
[00:08:30]  Go ahead.  I think if he becomes President, it will show a lot of black America, a lot of African Americans  living in this country, that, hey, there it is.  There is.  The guy is now at the—black man is at the pinnacle of success in the free world.  Well, growing up back, like when you say, in the 50s and 60s, it was always, and someday 
[00:09:00]  you can be President of the United States.  Well, jeepers, I'll work hard in school and everything and do that.  Well, if it turns out that a black man can become President in this country, I think all  excuses are off from the black man.  I think the black man can no longer say that he's being put down, kept down, being kept  from doing things that white people can do, education, jobs. 
[00:09:30]  I mean, a black man in the White House.  Holy Jesus Palomino.  No, that means no excuses.  Black America will have to then step up and not blame white America and not put the blame  on the fact that people are keeping them down.  Hey, the guy's President. 
[00:10:00]  He's unraveling.  Game over.  He's unraveling.  Game over.  Hold on.  Hold on a minute.  You win.  First coaching, then the presidency of the United States of America.  And that's all I'm saying is some good could come out of it because it will, and I see  it as an inspiration to black America.  Not as some type of, I don't know, challenge.  It should inspire to say, look how far we've come from the 60s and the 50s and the whites 
[00:10:30]  and blacks only fountains and bathrooms and diners.  When a black man is sitting at the pinnacle of the free world, the presidency of the United  States of America, how can another black man then turn around and say, I'm being kept  down by the man when the man is in the White House and he is your man?  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:11:00]  Thank you.  So I think maybe some good could come out of it.  I had to rationalize it as I was staring at the ceiling in utter fear trying to sleep  last night.  What country are you going to move to?  Australia.  Australia.  You already have it figured out.  Let's go to Rob.  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  Hi.  I'd like to know one policy that you like from Obama, Opie.  Opie?  Question?  Answer?  Opie?  Opie?  Comment?  I'll tell you why I, at this point, love Obama.  Wow. 
[00:11:30]  Okay.  I love Obama because it drives Anthony nuts.  Ah.  Okay.  Viable answer?  I like your answer.  My new thing, I have a lot of fun driving Anthony nuts.  Yes.  And when I find a little in, I have to go for it.  I am having a little trouble dealing with this.  I don't know where it comes from.  Wait, can I just finish with Rob?  Rob, I don't really give a crap who the president is in the end. 
[00:12:00]  Okay.  Because I really don't.  I just don't see anything changing.  Well, see now, this is different.  And I don't think Obama will make that much of a change.  Oh, you don't do yet.  Because of what Jimmy was saying yesterday.  The checks and the balances of our fine government.  Not one man will have the power to do incredible change in this country.  Not since Kennedy.  Let me give you a name I think you can understand, relate to.  Tiger Woods. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  He entered golf and changed the face of the game, didn't he?  Sure.  Now, why do you think that is?  Because golf was ready for a change.  Yeah.  And it had nothing to do with his skin color.  It absolutely did.  People were attracted to him.  He got attention because he broke so many barriers on the golf course.  And he was absolutely superior, still is, on the links. 
[00:13:00]  I think in the end.  If it was just another good white guy, I don't think he'd have gotten the attention that he got.  Because he was black and broke down a lot of barriers.  He was so much better than any other player playing on the PGA Tour.  Or that's why.  There was no one close to his skill level.  And not the fact that.  He was winning everything.  It didn't hurt.  Black people weren't known to be golfers.  It didn't hurt that he was black.  But first of all, I think to this day, there's not a lot of black people that watch golf on Sundays. 
[00:13:30]  It was his skill level.  He was winning tournaments by 10, 15 strokes.  It was insane where he brought a lot of attention because of his skill level.  Let me tell you something, though.  99% of the people could give a flying F about golf before Tiger Woods.  There were great golfers in history.  No one really cared about golf.  It was a stuffy white guy sport.  And then a black guy comes in.  Tiger Woods tears it up. 
[00:14:00]  And all of a sudden, people that didn't know anything about golf knew about it because of Tiger.  And I absolutely believe that it was because he, as a black guy, broke down that barrier.  That stuffy, country club, white guy golf barrier.  And opened it up to people that knew nothing about golf to go, wow, this guy's good.  Because he got the attention.  Because he was good, yes.  But also because of his race.  It was the way he played.  I'm sorry.  He hit the ball way further than anyone else had. 
[00:14:30]  People wouldn't care.  His skills were way above anybody else.  And still is.  You're too close to the game.  The normal person wouldn't give a crap about another white guy being really good at golf.  They wouldn't know his name.  They wouldn't care.  I completely disagree.  You're insane.  I completely disagree.  Jimmy, comment.  Third party comment.  Jimmy, comment.  You're both right.  Nice wishy-washy answer.  Thank you.  He is, by the way, the best player of the game. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  That drew attention.  Him being black made it more interesting.  People are like, wow, a young black guy made it kind of hip.  But he was that great.  Oh, I would never sell him short on his talent and how good he is.  But I think he got more attention from people that never knew anything about golf because he was a black guy.  We've been following Tiger Woods since he was four years old.  We.  People interested in golf.  Not you.  No.  He was on Mike Douglas and stuff.  He was part of pop culture since he was four or five years old. 
[00:15:30]  All right.  Where's Rodney Allen Rippey now?  Well, Mike.  He was on TV when he was five, too.  I understand.  Cute as a button.  I understand.  Mike Douglas is whatever.  But at the time, Mike Douglas was a pretty popular guy on TV.  And they knew this kid, Tiger Woods, had skills at four or five years old.  Yeah.  The skill.  You can't take away the skill thing.  Never trying to.  Never trying to.  He barely acknowledges that he's black.  Well, barely.  He does.  He's more proud of the fact that he's, I don't even know, what, Filipino or the other, what his mom is? 
[00:16:00]  Married to a white girl.  Well, what is his mom?  She's from one of the Asian countries.  Thai?  I'm not sure which one exactly.  But he's more proud of that.  He goes over there and plays in their tournament every year.  And he's, you know.  Yeah.  He doesn't really acknowledge the black side of him.  Well, other people have put that emphasis on him.  Like, what's his name?  Oh, God.  I wish I could remember his name.  Oh.  God, it made a little joke about him when he got the jacket. 
[00:16:30]  Fuzzy Zeller.  Huh?  Fuzzy Zeller.  Yeah.  Thank you, man.  Like Fuzzy Zeller.  What did Fuzzy say?  Oh, he said something racist.  Oh, did he?  Yeah.  He said something pretty racist.  What did Fuzzy say there?  After Tiger won his jacket.  I think he tried to buy him a flight with Payne Stewart.  He said something about his diet.  Right, right.  That they were going to have to... 
[00:17:00]  Stereotypically...  Supply some food that would have been a racial stereotype.  Watermelon?  In the clubhouse now.  Oh, hey.  Maybe.  I'm not sure what it was.  It's probably something like that.  But it's a, you know, you're just...  What Fuzzy Zeller said, Tiger Woods is a phenomenon.  Not many can explain a Cablan Asian American.  What?  I've never heard of Cablan...  C-A-B-L-A-N Asian American. 
[00:17:30]  What's that?  A Cablan Asian?  I've never heard of that before.  Have you?  Asian that drives cabs?  I have no idea what that is.  With the mean golf game, his white side holds the putter as he stands at the tee.  His Asian side works the sweatshops of his sponsor, Nike.  And his black side at the Masters will eat fried chicken and greens.  Perhaps Chitlin's...  Whoa.  At the...  Whoa. 
[00:18:00]  Whoa.  Whoa.  Yeah, whole fuzzy.  Whoa.  Perhaps Chitlin's at the...  Wow.  Wow.  Fuzzy's a silly one.  Fuzzy.  Perhaps Chitlin's at the...  N-word est.  Oh, wow.  Golf dinner y'all ever seen.  At least that's what Fuzzy Zeller said.  Wow.  That's fuzzy.  Anybody said they took it out of context.  Damn fuzzy. 
[00:18:30]  All right.  Hey, we're just getting started.  This is what we got for you guys today.  We have Hillary almost crying.  Yeah.  We have a poll I took last night that tells you who you should vote for for president.  Oh, well, maybe I can get a little better idea of who I can vote for.  Basically answer a bunch of questions, and then they tally eight.  This website will tally eight your answers.  Tally eight.  And they will tell you who you should be voting for.  All righty.  All right?  It makes it a lot easier for you. 
[00:19:00]  This better not be a gag where it says Obama.  It's not a gag.  It's not a gag.  And I'll tell you who they said I should vote for.  I'm not saying until after you take the quiz.  All righty.  And then we'll pass the website on to everybody else, and we'll have it up on onaradio.com  as well.  You can take it yourself.  And, of course, like I said, Hillary crying.  This has some legs, and we're sort of – well, we know the people that did it.  There was a heckler yelling to Hillary, iron my shirt. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  We have the audio.  It's starting to get legs out there.  Is that the guy who held the sign-up?  It's a bunch of guys from the Toucher & Rich show.  Yeah.  Heard on BCN.  That's why I said good morning to BCN, because we're going to give Toucher & Rich and their  show a little exposure today.  I guess one of their interns and another guy that works for the show went up there, and  she's giving a speech.  And clear as day, you hear one of Toucher & Rich's guys yelling, iron my shirt to Hillary, 
[00:20:00]  and she had to acknowledge it.  And holding the sign up.  And then I got a communique from, I believe, Toucher last night.  I'll read the email.  That's hilarious.  We do have to take a break.  Now, is he the drunk one?  Toucher – oh, no, this is from Rich.  Oh, yeah.  I see that.  I'm like, wait, you got a text?  Was it just rambling letters?  Yeah, no, this is Rich, I think, the responsible one, but who could tell?  Because he was the one that held up the sign at the Masters. 
[00:20:30]  What was that sign again?  That guy –  Iron my shirt, bitch.  What?  I think it's an iron my shirt, bitch.  Oh, okay.  So they're keeping the theme alive.  Of course.  So I don't know if Rich is that much more responsible than Toucher.  But Rich writes me last night, he goes, guys, here's video from Fox News of Adolfo, I think.  That's how they pronounce his name on the show.  And intern Nick from our show getting kicked out of Hillary Clinton's campaign rally in New Hampshire yesterday. 
[00:21:00]  Afterwards, someone – this is the inside info we got.  Afterwards, someone who is to be believed from Hillary's campaign called Adolfo a F-face.  And we have that audio.  That's great.  We'll play that for everybody in just a bit here.  And we got Clemens taping phone calls.  We got a fun day on the Opie and Anthony show.  So stay right there.  Shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:21:30]  Shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Tom came in here, Tom Chiasano, and kind of agreed with Anthony with the whole Tiger Woods thing.  Yeah.  I've been following golf my whole life, and I just – I think his skill level was way more important than his skin color when he was coming up.  That's just it.  You've been paying attention to golf and playing your entire life.  And golf is kind of a microcosm.  It's a very small little society. 
[00:22:00]  And then when Tiger came in as a black man, even though he doesn't acknowledge his blackness as much as I think a lot of black people would hope he would, that kind of opened it up.  The press jumped on it.  They saw an opportunity to show a black guy in a traditionally white sport, a traditionally racist white sport, closed country clubs, things like that.  And I think that opened up the game to people that ordinarily would not even pay attention to golf, no matter how good the player was. 
[00:22:30]  But it wasn't good enough that he was just black.  His skill level was so much better, too, which made it interesting.  You can't just tell an athlete comes along that is so much better than everyone else in the sport.  You go to Babe Ruth.  You go to Muhammad Ali.  Michael Jordan.  Mitch Kumpstein.  Mitch Kumpstein, of course.  Great.  We'll have to agree to disagree.  I'm sure it opened up some fine programs and minorities got into golf, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, it just opened it up.  I'm just saying.  The guy went so much further than anyone else, just had so much more skills, was jacked.  No golfer was jacked before.  They were all fat guys with beer bellies before Tiger Woods.  But if he was that good and a white guy, he would have been amazing to people that paid attention to golf.  And now all the guys on tour are in shape.  They've got trainers, and they work out in between tournaments. 
[00:23:30]  He just changed the entire game.  I'm not saying that the fact that he is black didn't have something to do with it, but I don't think it has all to do with it.  No, no.  If he was just a black guy that wasn't good, you wouldn't know anything about him.  I think his skills is as important, if not more important, than the fact that he was a black guy.  To make him the great golfer, yeah.  But honestly, what got me interested in it, because I liked the fact that a black guy was doing something in a traditionally racist white sport, 
[00:24:00]  what you always saw as a racist white sport.  Right.  I thought it was great.  I'm like, oh, he's got to be bugging them.  Every time he wins, it's going to annoy all those old white people.  It just kind of made me happy.  And then I started to like him.  See, I just, from day one, watched the guy, because I'm like, wow, this guy is better than everybody else by far.  By far.  And my Sundays, I would just lay around and watch golf with my dad.  You can't look at it that way because you've been so into golf for your whole life.  I'm talking about people that didn't care about it.  When people didn't care about golf, they didn't care about golf. 
[00:24:30]  If you were going around the channel on a Sunday and you came around golf, if you weren't into golf, you wouldn't give it a second thought.  You'd watch somebody just putt and change the channel because you could care less.  Because it got people that wouldn't ever watch golf to kind of stop and go, oh, it's that Tiger Woods guy.  Let me look at this.  Well, there was a, I'll just say, an older relative in my family.  Ah.  Mm-hmm.  Loved watching Tiger Woods on Sundays. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  And this person didn't love, oh, so I don't think it was the fact that Tiger Woods was black, that this person in my family.  Well, it might have been because sometimes that just annoys people.  Like Jimmy said, it was great to watch some people, some of these stuffy people get really annoyed at the fact that he was so good at the game.  You're all forgetting one angle, but Tom is here, so we'll go ahead, Tom.  Yes, sir.  I mean, look at how high the TV ratings are every time he's in contention where he plays the tournaments.  It's not just because he's that good.  It's because he brings in that many different people. 
[00:25:30]  And it's because of all the different ethnicities that he's brought interest into the game.  And it's because he's a black man in what has been a traditional white man's game.  Yeah, I'm sure that helps.  They're rooting against white people.  I mean, when a baseball team gets a Hispanic, you know, what?  I should have put white people watching because he's their guy.  They're happy to see him.  That's kind of why I like them.  I'm going to agree to that to a certain point.  Like when a sports team gets a Latino pitcher, all the Latinos in that city all of a sudden love that team. 
[00:26:00]  Well, Japanese now.  Or the Japanese is even a better example.  When you get a Japanese baseball player, I mean, the stands are full of Japanese people that normally wouldn't come that are rooting for their guy.  I get that's part of it as well.  But he can't take away his skills.  No, no, never.  Never would.  The guy's amazing.  That's what makes it so big that his skills are that much better than everybody else.  Yeah.  And that he happens to be a person of color. 
[00:26:30]  So it's opened up the game to all sorts of different people of different ethnicities to say, hey, you know what?  I'm interested in maybe I could do that, too.  There you go.  You're all forgetting the Nike advertising campaign, too.  I'm telling you, that was a huge part of making him as famous as he was with the advertising around him.  I am Tiger Woods.  I am Tiger Woods.  I am Tiger Woods.  These great commercials they had.  Whoever marketed him was brilliant.  That was a big part of it, too.  There you go.  He wasn't going to get those unless he was that good.  Because they marketed him like a sports guy and not like a typical golfer.  They marketed him the same way they would have marketed a basketball player, a baseball player, a football player, like an athlete. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  They didn't market him like, here's another guy swinging a putter.  Duffy, yeah.  He didn't care about.  They might have, like he was a hip, cool athlete.  It's time to hear Obama.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Thank you, Iowa.  Yo, they said.  Sounds like Gomez Adams.  Tish.  They said this day would never come.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, my God.  Getting goosebumps.  They said.  All the wrong reasons.  Our sights were set too high.  They said this country was too divided, too disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose.  But on this January night, at this defining moment in history, you have done what the cynics said we couldn't do. 
[00:28:00]  By the way, hey.  Oh, my God.  The video I saw, because I was doing some YouTubing last night, most of those people were white cheering in the crowd.  Oh, I know.  I saw that.  All right.  You did see that.  Mm-hmm.  But it's weird.  Like, we look at it like it's odd.  But every black, every white president that's won, which is all of them, I mean, has had plenty of black people cheering for them.  Sure.  Or like every white candidate.  It's just weird to see the other way.  And it's a little hurtful.  Black people, be gentle.  We're getting used to this. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's just it.  Thank you, Jimmy.  You put that in a nice little context.  We're just getting used to this.  We're having a little hard time with it as whitey.  You're making us realize we are more racist than we thought.  I'm all for it.  Good for him.  He's a great guy.  They're going to elect a who?  We really need a little time here to sort this out.  A little more Obama for everybody.  You have done what the state of New Hampshire can do in five days. 
[00:29:00]  You have done what America can do in this new year, 2008.  In lines that stretched around schools and churches, in small towns, and in big cities, 
[00:29:30]  you came together as Democrats, Republicans, and Independents to stand up and say that we  are one nation.  We are one people.  And our time for change has come.  See, that's the scary part.  The change part is a little scary.  Time to put him in a bulletproof bubble and roll him around the country.  It's time for the bulletproof bubble.  I'm sure there are some people in certain parts of this country that are really not happy 
[00:30:00]  and really intolerant.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to have to give him a Kevlar hat.  Kevlar ear mittens.  Ear mittens?  He's got to hire a food taster.  He's got to hire a food taster at this point.  He's got some people to hire now.  Yeah.  So Obama was celebrating.  And Hillary was just about crying. 
[00:30:30]  Hillary got what they called misty-eyed.  They showed her.  I saw the video.  She was trying to explain how this is very personal to her.  This is very important to her.  This campaign and to win for the country, for her.  And she got a little choked up.  Yeah.  What I thought was interesting about this audio was that it sounded like she was being real. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  That's a...  Sounded like.  Because I'm not...  Who knows what the real...  Who knows?  Who knows what the real Hillary sounds like?  I don't know.  But is she listening to this program?  But I mean, it's certainly...  She's certainly not doing the...  Give me a little bit of Hillary.  I think this country needs a change.  And I am the person who should be brought in...  Like it's so weird. 
[00:31:30]  It's like revving up an engine or something.  Yeah, she does that fake politician speech from the oldie days.  Sure.  She should have a stovepipe hat on her thighs.  Well, we didn't hear the ak-ak version of Hillary yesterday.  Ak!  Ak-ak!  We heard Hillary very close to tears.  Yeah.  She kind of breaks up a little bit.  Here we go.  It's not easy.  It's not easy.  And I couldn't do it if I just didn't passionately believe it was the right thing to do. 
[00:32:00]  You know, I have so many opportunities from this country.  I just don't want to see us fall backwards.  You know?  So.  Eh.  Pick up your skirt.  Can I tell you something?  I wish she sounded like that from the beginning.  No.  She sounds a lot more human right there.  She sounds human, but in a bad way.  Because now you're thinking, oh, what, the campaign's hard? 
[00:32:30]  How about sitting in a war room for a while?  Yeah.  This is difficult.  I've been sitting here in this war room for hours, and I don't know.  It's a guy, guy, guy, guy, guy, guy, guy, guy, guy, guy.  Red is shooting at our warships.  I don't know if I can.  Oh, okay, okay, okay.  I got it in control.  Okay, which boats are ours?  Which of these little boats are ours?  They're boats, right? 
[00:33:00]  Do we have planes?  How do we got it?  Egg, egg, egg, egg, egg, egg, egg.  But she sounds human, but she also knows, I personally think, that she knows it's over.  And it's really bumming her out because she's pretty much lived her whole life to get to the White House.  And she's starting to realize that it's not going to happen.  All one leader from another country has to do is, Hillary, baby, baby, stick your head in gravy. 
[00:33:30]  Wash it off with bubble gum.  Send it to the Navy.  You win.  People are sick and tired of the Clintons in the Bushes as a whole.  No more Clintons in the office.  Do you realize if she wins, how many years it'll be from having Bushes or Clintons in the office?  Just Clinton Bushes.  It'll be like a quarter century.  George Bush Sr. to now.  It's like, all right, already.  We get it, Clinton.  Enough of them.  Enough.  You got Obama. 
[00:34:00]  Oh.  That's going to win the nomination for the Democrats.  It's looking better and better, sure.  And John McCain is in the lead as far as the Republicans go.  And he's insane.  He's a kind of a crazy guy.  He is nuts.  I like him, though.  He's barely holding it together.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's going to have some flashback at the wrong time, I'm thinking. 
[00:34:30]  But that's, hey, that might be what we need.  All right, here's more Hillary crying, or we're close to it yesterday.  You know, this is very personal for me.  It's not just political.  It's not just public.  I see what's happening.  And we have to reverse it.  And some people think elections are a game.  They think it's like who's up or who's down.  It's about our country.  It's about our kids' futures.  And it's really about all of us together.  You know, some of us put ourselves out there and do this against some pretty difficult odds. 
[00:35:00]  And we do it, each one of us, because we care about our country.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Stop it!  We make fun of her because she sounds like a robot.  And now she's kind of sounding human.  Because she went the opposite end of the spectrum.  How about you sound like a strong leader?  That's what people want.  They want leadership in a president. 
[00:35:30]  They want somebody that talks about what they're going to do and not in that phony political way.  There's got to be, even if it's, you've got to be a good actor, I guess.  Because good old Ronnie Reagan stepped up there.  You believed him.  He spoke.  It sounded sincere.  He had his agenda.  Whether people liked it or not, it's what he, I guess what he believed in.  And I've got to assume it was what he believed in because a lot of times the polls were against it. 
[00:36:00]  But he said, screw you.  I'm a president.  I'm going to do this.  I think this is best for the country.  Yeah.  That was kind of this sincere.  Even Jimmy Carter, for how bad of a president he was, he was very sincere.  And I think his intentions were good.  He wanted to do good for this country.  You know, and he spoke very sincerely and from the heart and honestly, a horrible president.  But, and then we're just, we're into this whole thing where you can't, every word out of these people's mouths are calculated and twisted around by the media and used against them. 
[00:36:30]  So they got to watch everything they say.  Not Obama.  And it makes, yes, Obama too, he's just as calculated as all the other candidates.  That's what makes it, it's refreshing if you get somebody in there that at least sounds honest and sincere and like they want the job because they want to do something for the country and not just so they could be another picture on the wall, you know? 
[00:37:00]  It's, it's, it's, like Hillary, just a phony, just a phony who thinks she's entitled to be the president.  Obama, I don't know enough about the guy, seriously.  I just don't know enough about him except his race.  That's pretty much it.  Well.  I don't know what he stands for.  Start Googling the Obama.  I don't know because he's all over the place. 
[00:37:30]  He's trying to satisfy white people, which he's doing.  I mean, white people are in droves.  They're coming to see his speeches and everything.  And I don't even think black people, black people aren't coming out in droves for him because they don't even know what the hell he stands for.  They don't care.  They're going to vote for him.  No one in Iowa is black.  Yeah.  How can they?  There's three black people in Iowa.  That's right.  And they live on the outskirts.  You know, freaking Oprah did it to Hillary, man.  Oprah effed Hillary bad.  I heard Hillary, right.  Oh, man, did Oprah screw Hillary over.  Obama and made it okay for, like, you know, the fat white housewives to vote for Obama. 
[00:38:00]  People are so easily led.  All right.  Here we go.  The last bit of Hillary audio of her getting a little emotional.  Bit of the human touch.  But some of us are right and some of us are wrong.  Some of us are ready and some of us are not.  Some of us know what we will do on day one and some of us haven't really thought that through enough.  And so when we look at the array of problems we have and the potential for it getting really spinning out of control, this is one of the most important elections America has ever faced. 
[00:38:30]  So as tired as I am, and I am.  Say that again.  And as difficult it is to kind of keep up what I try to do on the road, like occasionally exercise and try to eat right.  It's tough.  Easiest food is pizza.  I just believe so strongly in who we are as a nation.  So I'm going to do everything I can to make my case and, you know, when the voters get to decide. 
[00:39:00]  Shove that pizza in your face.  And the voters get to decide.  I actually like her there, but the problem is I almost feel like someone said to her, look, you fat cabbed robot.  Can you please act like a human being?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's going to be a human.  That's what happened.  They did polling.  They listened.  They listened to people talking.  And they said, oh, look, she sounds like a robot.  No one likes her.  She's not sincere enough.  So they sat her down and told her, be sincere. 
[00:39:30]  Maybe even choke up a little bit.  Yeah.  I believe every bit of what you just heard out of Hillary is calculated.  Really?  Yep.  What do you think?  I'm not believing anything out of her.  What do you think Bill Clinton is thinking at this point?  I'm on my shirt.  I think I'm on my shirt.  I think he's I think he's very relieved.  I don't think he wants to be the, you know, the first lady moving back into the White House again after he was the president.  Come on.  You really think he wants to be the first lady?  No.  He doesn't want any part of that. 
[00:40:00]  The first first man.  The first first man.  And you were the president.  After you were the president.  He doesn't want that.  He'll never admit it publicly.  No.  He doesn't want to deal with that crap.  He was the president for eight years.  Let me see.  Let me see.  What, he's going to have to have tea with all the other broads from around?  Let me put this in person.  You know, he's going to have to have tea with all the leaders' wives from around the globe?  I've picked out the China pattern, the new China pattern for the White House.  I believe the leaders that visit Hillary are going to like this China pattern. 
[00:40:30]  And if I could show you the curtains, I've made a few changes around here.  I think it's good.  He's going to have to give, like, the tour for Diane Sawyer of the White House.  Yeah, yeah.  Show off the White House Christmas tree.  So, Bill Clinton, former president, and now the first lady.  Yeah, I'm the first man.  You know, in charge of doing things like getting dinners together for dignitaries. 
[00:41:00]  And, you know, tours come through.  And did I show you the silverware that I picked out special for?  Oh, oh.  Wearing a little pillbox hat like Jackie O.  And praying that Oswald is around.  Having tea in the Rose Garden?  He doesn't want that.  He doesn't want tea in the Rose Garden.  I'm trying to think of how I'd feel.  You know, I've been in radio for a while or sitting here.  Just imagine you're done.  Right.  And your chick moves into the seat. 
[00:41:30]  And you just got to sit there and watch her do your show.  It would be a little weird.  It would be a little weird.  A little weird.  He doesn't want it.  He can't say that.  No.  Bet you there's a little relief.  He'd be an ambassador.  That's what would happen.  Yeah.  He wouldn't.  They obviously would figure something out for him.  But call me a ladybird Clinton.  That's what I want to be called.  Thank you, Steve, for Bayshore.  Jimmy's right.  But I would like to think about it the other way, where he would have a, you know, one of those stupid hat.  The pillbox hat.  The pillbox hat.  Jackie O's pillbox. 
[00:42:00]  With a little purse.  A matching purse.  He's in Dallas picking Hillary's brains and his own genitals off the trunk.  Oh, man.  Let's say hi to Greg of Long Island.  Heading toward a break here.  But first, Greg.  What's up, Greg?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, you mentioned McCain before.  He's got that Opie food pocket going on on the side of his face.  Well, really?  He talked about a food pocket?  No, he's just got kind of that cheek. 
[00:42:30]  I think it's from the Viet Cong beating the crap out of it.  Yeah, poking it.  Sir?  Poking it or letting water drop on it for a month straight.  He's cracking it with a rifle butt every morning.  Might have swollen it up a little bit.  And by the way, breaking news, but Greg Audio does not have a food pocket anymore.  Oh, nice.  Got a nice cleaning, and the doctor took care of it, and then I got this solution that dissolves  anything that's going on in there that keeps the food pocket open. 
[00:43:00]  And I feel like my breath is a lot fresher.  I would like to talk to a Chris.  I'm kissing my girl again.  Were you not kissing her for a while?  No, of course not.  Peck it around the cheek instead of?  I was just trying to make fun.  But you go to the kiss, and you know that you have dumpster gums, so you just peck the cheek.  Dumpster gums.  I'd like to talk to Chris on line three.  All right.  He thinks I should stick to politics, comedy and not politics.  Yes, Chris, sir?  What's the problem with my take on things? 
[00:43:30]  I'm a long-time fan, actually.  All righty.  You guys are hysterical.  Thank you, sir.  But I think it's kind of clear.  Yes, what did I do?  I'm sorry.  That you guys don't know.  What?  We what?  Never mind.  No, I want to hear what you don't know.  That old gag.  No, it's all right.  No, go ahead, Chris.  No, really.  Why should I stick to comedy and not politics?  What did you not like about what I said? 
[00:44:00]  I don't think you guys...  All right.  You got me.  Have a good morning.  See you later.  There you go.  That was the New Year's Eve gig, Jimmy.  I just did it a little differently for you.  Anyway, we got to take a break.  Chris could call back.  I was just having fun with him.  We'll talk to Chris after the break.  Also, after the break, you can't go anywhere. 
[00:44:30]  Trust me, there's nothing else to listen to anyway.  What are you going to listen to?  Cubby.  Cubby here in New York?  Cubby.  Matt Siegel?  Yuck.  Isn't that just the show without Whoopi?  Yeah.  Are you going to tune in to Snortin' Norton?  Yuck.  No.  After the break, this is what we got for you.  We got Touchin' Rich audio.  One of their guys interrupted Hillary by yelling,  Iron my shirt.  We got the audio.  And it's got legs.  This thing is taking off today. 
[00:45:00]  This thing is taking off today.  And congratulations to Touchin' Rich.  This is a biggie.  We got the audio.  The audio.  It's hilarious.  Also, after the break, I'm going to ask Anthony a few questions from this website.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And by answering these questions, I want you to answer, like, you know, for real.  I'll be completely honest.  Don't mess around.  I'll be honest.  And then what this website does, it takes your answers, it tallyates, and tells you who... 
[00:45:30]  Tallyates.  Not a good word?  I don't know if it is a word.  It tabulates or tallies.  I like tallyates.  But tallyates is kind of a good word.  I like tallyates.  I think it's better than tabulate.  I like tallyates.  And it'll tell you who you should be voting for, for the presidency of the United States  of America.  I hope...  And I'll tell you that...  I hope I don't fall into a trick here.  I did the poll last night, and I'll tell you who they think I should vote for.  Mm-hmm.  Okay?  And you're going to do the poll next. 
[00:46:00]  Is my candidate alive, or did he die in 1945?  Just asking.  Enough about Hitler.  I didn't mean Hitler.  Yes, he meant garbles.  My God.  Hitler was a political hack.  We all know that.  Garbles.  Garbles.  All right.  So, yeah, don't go anywhere.  We got...  Trust me, the next break will be very, very good.  Best ever.  Best ever, I think.  Sure.  But first, we'll go to the FU line and see what's going on today.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line. 
[00:46:30]  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.  Yeah, I just want to leave a big FU to my buddy Bob at work.  The guy that does nothing.  A train runs your car over at a FU railroad crossing.  FU you, Bob.  Next message.  Here's a big FU to my boss, also known as my older brother.  Thank FU for making my life miserable. 
[00:47:00]  Next message.  I'd like to give a big FU to Boston St. Thomas Menino for bumping into me with his stupid  Bill Cosby Coogee sweater and not saying, excuse me, you mumbling FU.  Next message.  I just want to send a FU out to my ex-boss trying to freeze my unemployment money.  I hope you die of cancer in front of your children.  Next message.  I need to leave a big FU to all the southern drivers in the northeast on the New Jersey  Turnpike every time somebody is going slowly blocking the left lane, they got Florida or 
[00:47:30]  North Carolina plates.  F*** you.  Next message.  I'd like to tell my boss.  F*** you.  F*** you, smoker.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton.  You're rocking 10.  The most important radio show in America. 
[00:48:00]  In America.  In America.  In America.  Oh, America.  We need a new slogan for this show.  Do we?  All right, guys, you heard it.  Opie said it on the show.  Come up with a new slogan for the Opie and Anthony show.  Go.  Poll.  Poll number 877-212-0&A.  I got the slogan.  You got the slogan?  The new slogan for the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  I want to galvanize people.  All right.  What is it, Jimmy?  Opie and Anthony, get your hat.  I like it, bike gum. 
[00:48:30]  I think it has legs.  Of course it does.  You know, you see those old, like, black and white videos.  They go to the baseball game and they all have those old, old-timey hats.  A fedora or a derby.  I just call it the old-timey hats.  Maybe we bring back the old-timey hats.  Will the derby ever come back?  And you can spot our listeners on the streets of New York and Boston and Buffalo and everywhere  else by the old-timey hats.  Old-timey.  You can count the O&A fans by the old-timey hats.  Can I speak, by the way, about an old-timey hat for a moment? 
[00:49:00]  Because you made me think that I saw the Def Jam promotion for our pal Patrice O'Neal.  He's going to be on this season.  And a great stand-up Patrice.  Awful person.  Great stand-up.  And he's got, when he walks out, he really thinks he's Biggie Smalls.  Let's hope he ends up the same way.  Because he had that, he's got a stupid, fancy hat on sideways.  Really?  I want to, you know what I want to do to his hat?  I want a Susquehanna.  What was that, the Susquehanna Hat Company?  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[00:49:30]  I want to bat that hat down over his head.  Like, I want to hit it with a bat and then, like, just have the hat rim around his neck.  But he's coming, he's on Def Jam this season, I suppose.  He's got some nice press in the post today.  Oh, I didn't even know that.  It's quick.  It says, in the category, on fire, comedian Patrice O'Neal.  Literally?  Not only sold out comics over the holidays, but he's starring in Russell Simmons' Def Comedy Jam special on HBO.  And in Patrice on America, now on HBO On Demand. 
[00:50:00]  Look at him.  I wonder if some of his video podcasts have made it to HBO.  I did not see that article, but that bothers me even more.  And let me say, I'll only correct myself, I would not like to remove his hat with a bat.  I'd like to remove it with a grenade launcher.  I don't like it.  You don't like it at all, huh?  I certainly don't.  I bet you don't like your Cowboys chances.  Look at that.  Oh, nice.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Nice.  It is jinx.  It is jinx.  Dude, this Jessica Simpson is going to mess up your Cowboys. 
[00:50:30]  You know that, right?  I know.  I know.  A girl, a hot girl will wreck a guy.  You will forget to freaking eat over a hot chick.  You know what he's doing?  He's on the field.  He's supposed to be concentrating on the game.  And he's taking little looks trying to find his chick.  Yeah.  He's like, where is she?  Is she sitting down?  Is she in her seat?  Is she?  And it's distracting him from the game.  Right.  Our football expert happens to be a girl, which is very strange, but Travis has some info 
[00:51:00]  on the Jessica Simpson thing.  Well, yeah.  Young lady?  Yes.  Young lady.  What do you got?  Do that voice again?  Okay.  Hello.  We learned that.  Travis, how much do you weigh?  We did the weigh-in yesterday?  120.  120.  With a very manly beard, but stop.  And his legs look like someone glued pubes to G.I. Joe legs. 
[00:51:30]  Actual size, too.  His legs should have a toe tag on them.  They're awful.  Lily from Ron and Fez weighs more than he does.  She's like 123.  And she's really thin.  Yeah, exactly.  She's svelte.  Yes.  Travis's got knobby knees that are kind of bigger than the rest of his legs.  Like a newborn foal.  Yeah.  That's how thin his legs are.  But anyway, he knows football.  Yeah.  You know, I know.  So what do you got on Jessica Simpson? 
[00:52:00]  No, but Romo had the worst game of his career when Jessica Simpson decided to come to the  stadium and watch.  They lost 10-6 to the Eagles.  Right.  And his previous worst game was when his ex-girlfriend Carrie Underwood was watching  him play also against the Eagles.  Oh, boy.  Both of these games at home.  Oh, boy.  You know, so.  Was that the playoff game last year where he sucked?  No, it was during the regular season.  Can he stop banging country western singers and just do what Aikman did and just pretend  to date them?  Wink, wink.  Please.  But that's right. 
[00:52:30]  He can't control himself when he's ex-girlfriend.  No.  No.  He's pee-whipped, Jimmy.  Your cowboys are done.  And I'm pushing for the cowboys.  I'm pushing.  I'm very irritated.  Yeah, because he's whipped, so he keeps tabs on her, and he doesn't have the ability to  tell her, look, you can't come to the game.  Right.  You know, so the rest of the team sees her show up and just goes like, oh, it's over.  And didn't he, like, vacation in, what, like the Bahamas?  A bunch of teams.  Where are you, Rock? 
[00:53:00]  He's in Cabo San Lucas.  Hey, that place kicks ass.  But if you're in the playoffs, you should just stay home and rent some DVDs.  A bunch of the team is there.  They might have went for a day.  Wow.  Little Tom Brady news.  He left New York City because, you know, we're being hurt in Boston here.  He left Giselle's place yesterday and went back to Boston to prepare.  He's got to prepare.  Right.  He understands the difference.  But Tony's going to, like, you know, he's going to be with Jessica until the last possible  You know what's good, though? 
[00:53:30]  So not much partying or drinking go on and go down there in Cabo.  No.  I was there, and I don't remember drinking anything.  I don't remember anything.  I don't remember drinking anything.  Yeah.  It was wonderful.  There's these guys, these Mexican guys that have these, like, bandoliers, and they're full  of shots of tequila.  And you just, hey, hey, amigo.  Hey.  And you're just doing shots of tequila, and you don't even realize you're just drunk off 
[00:54:00]  your ass.  Right.  And then you've got to get into a boat with some guy, the boat's, like, ready to sink.  Just loads a bunch of people there and takes you back to your cruise ship.  Oh.  And you're drunk.  There's no safety equipment.  I wonder how many people just die doing this.  That's what I love about going down in the Caribbean.  They don't believe in laws.  There's no laws or rules.  Like, everything you do here in the United States, there's a rule to it.  Highly regulated. 
[00:54:30]  If you break the rule, you're thrown off or whatever it is.  Yeah.  Someone yells at you.  Yeah.  You pay a fine.  You do something.  The people that are doing things for you need permits to do them and this and that.  You go to these other countries, and you think all that stuff is in place, because it's  just you, you drink a little, you get on a boat, you go.  You don't realize the boat tips over, you die.  Ah!  Ah!  No one gets anything.  I love it.  The family doesn't sue.  They don't get things.  It's not a regulated thing.  This guy that's taking you in the boat didn't have to take a test. 
[00:55:00]  He just had to buy a boat.  I learned there were no rules down there when I went with the girl.  Yeah!  Down to the...  This is all it means.  Down to the...  Which trip was this?  I was able to do a bunch of trips.  Oh, I think it was Nassau.  Yeah.  In the Bahamas there.  I went to Atlantis.  Woo!  Yeah.  And we decided to do a little snorkeling with the sharks.  Right.  I'm like, oh, they obviously have got this figured out nice.  Sure, it's safe.  And, you know, you snorkel, and they take you to this place in the water, and there's like 
[00:55:30]  a feed box at the bottom of the ocean, which is, you know, at this part, only 20, 30 feet  down.  You're snorkeling on the top, and you watch the sharks feed into the feed box, because  they open it up a little bit and let some of the fish come out, dead fish, and it's  like chum, and the sharks come.  You have some sangria before you went under?  Right.  Woo!  Party boat!  And then they time it perfectly as the sharks start making their slow, swirly swirl to 
[00:56:00]  the surface, where you're snorkeling, looking at them, because now they're curious, and they're  a bit riled up and a bit hungry, and they get a little too close to your feet, where you  go into the fetal position as you're snorkeling and holding on to this rope.  That has to be safe, right?  Of course it is.  Then all of a sudden, the guy in the boat goes, oh, everyone back on the boat.  They wouldn't do it if it wasn't safe, Opie.  And you're taking your time, and then you can tell, no, no, it's time to get back on  the boat, everybody.  And everyone gets back on the boat, and then they take more chum out, and they throw it 
[00:56:30]  in the water.  And these sharks start jumping out of the water with their mouths, like, ah!  Yeah.  You're like, I don't think they figured this out perfectly.  This is dangerous.  You would never get away with that in America.  You wouldn't get away with that in the Keys or anywhere in Florida.  But down there, it's just some dopey boat captain going, I think this is safe.  Do you think they check those parasails also?  Do you think they check those cables every day? 
[00:57:00]  Do you think they check the connections and the parachute and the harness that holds you  and your loved one as you're cruising above the beach in the parasail?  No.  They'll snap it once in a while.  Doesn't matter.  They don't check that.  There's no inspector that comes by to make sure they checked it.  Right.  Let's say hi to Brian in Washington State.  Brian.  Brian.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Brian.  Morning, gentlemen.  Yeah, what's up?  Doing good. 
[00:57:30]  Hey, it was Romo sucked out against the Seattle Seahawks two years ago in the playoffs.  Oh, okay.  He bobbled the field goal.  All they had to do was a chip shot field goal and he bobbled it and Kerry Underwood was in  the audience.  That's it.  Yeah.  He can't take a chick being out there.  He can't take pressure.  He's really starting to concern me because didn't they lose two out of the three final  games?  Oof.  Oh.  I don't know.  I'm not happy with the way he played, especially that Philly game.  Everyone's entitled to a bad game, but he seems to fall apart when the pressure's on. 
[00:58:00]  Dude, a hot chick will wreck a guy.  Yeah.  Well, the women don't understand what kind of power they actually have over guys.  If he does, if he blows this game, I am going to throw a cream puff.  Ooh.  Wow.  Temper, temper.  ESPN reporting that ESPN.com had Brady advising Romo not to let Jessica go to the games.  Giselle has never been to a Patriots game. 
[00:58:30]  Wow.  He basically, I think he basically tells her, look, you're going to be a distraction to  me, to the fans, everybody else.  I really don't want you at the game.  That Tom Brady's all man.  He's all man.  He certainly is.  Either or he doesn't want Giselle to see him queering off and kissing his linebackers.  And his defensive tackles.  He prefers the larger men.  I don't believe they should have said implied that Tom Brady was good.  Let's say hi to Steve and Dover. 
[00:59:00]  Steve.  Hey.  Good morning.  What's up, Steve?  Hey, man.  Steve.  I want you to know that I went on a snorkeling cruise down in Aruba.  And I thought they were going to give you a beer on the way back.  But they thought you were going to be on the way out.  Why not drink a little before, you know, you're going to be scuba diving.  Yeah.  Or snorkeling.  That one.  Loosens you up.  Yeah.  Why not?  That's got to be safe, right?  Yeah.  Some free punch.  Sangria.  Sure.  A few beers. 
[00:59:30]  Red Stripe.  And, by the way, if you ever go to Atlantis and, like, snorkel, I give this warning every  time we talk about Atlantis, and they have, like, a man-made lagoon, and they let the  water come in from the ocean, and you decide to snorkel in there, watch out for those little  yellow nip-nip fish.  The little fish will nip you.  That will just bite at you.  They don't look threatening whatsoever, and they look so nice that you swim up to them  because, like, oh, look at the nice yellow fish.  I've seen these in aquariums and restaurants.  And then they take little bites out of you. 
[01:00:00]  And they're not scared of you, and they'll just nip, nip, nip, and they effing hurt.  They just take tiny pieces of skin off your body the entire time you're trying to, like,  take a look at them.  And don't dump out of that opium-ent bite.  Well, well, well, yeah, there's the nip-nip yellow fish.  All right, I got you.  Yeah.  Aren't they cute?  Hey, uh, no, they bite you.  I know.  That's kind of sort of like puppies and kittens when they're frightened.  They're like water mosquitoes. 
[01:00:30]  No reason.  You're just swimming, and they latch on you and bite.  How big are they?  They hurt.  They're about the size of a silver dollar.  These things are all about trickery, Jimmy.  They don't look scary or threatening whatsoever, but they will just nip, nip.  And then when they know they got you, they call all their little yellow fish friends,  and they all come nipping at you.  Are they like piranha?  No!  No, if they were like piranha, there'd be bones at the bottom.  That would be great.  They just put piranha in the lagoon. 
[01:01:00]  Go ahead.  You know what?  Let your fingernails grow just a little bit, and just go like this, and pinch yourself as  hard as you can between the two nails.  That's what they do over and over again.  I do that every morning when I walk into the studio.  Just pinch yourself.  Oh, I can't believe I'm here again.  It's too good to be true, Lord.  It's too good to be true.  Let's go to Ryan in Florida.  Ryan.  What's up, guys?  My name's Ryan.  I've been listening to you since you guys went free.  I'd exit.  I love your show.  Thank you, Ryan.  Hey, thank you, sir. 
[01:01:30]  My girl and I were down in Freeport, Bahamas once, and we were on this little rickety platform  out in the middle of the water, and they were doing this parasailing thing.  So she went and got back.  I'm going to take a picture of you.  She stands in front of the platform.  The whole rope catches her up underneath her arm.  She gets lifted off the platform.  End of the air, about 20 feet, her top flies off, and I'm floating around watching her get  saved by these two dudes in a boat.  Parasite.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh.  I don't even pay attention. 
[01:02:00]  No.  How long do you go in your parasite, mister?  I do that.  A couple hundred feet, right?  Yeah.  20 minutes, and you go way up.  You see all these sharks swimming around by the beach, too.  It's really wild.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, you could go up a couple hundred feet, and then they take you down and drag your feet  in the water, and then speed the boat back up and take you back up again.  But what if your rope breaks?  You're dead.  Would you parasail down?  It all depends on what rope.  I'd float into some power lines.  You'd probably parachute down into the water and drown as the canopy goes all over your 
[01:02:30]  head.  Yeah, you'll be all tangled up in the cords, fighting for your life.  They would tie it in a double knot and just take the boat out again.  Wouldn't you love to just have someone parasailing and then just head towards the Verrazano and  smash their faces inside of it?  I haven't seen any parasailing on the Hudson.  They're actually, I'm trying to open my own parasailing company.  Are you?  It's called See the Big Apple, but while you're sailing in the air. 
[01:03:00]  Dot com.  Watch that bridge.  I love the dot com part.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Tom in Tennessee.  Tom.  You're an ass.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  I just want to let you know, the fish you're talking about, the yellow tang, that, and  I used to have a small tank, and there's a little fish up there called a peppermint  shrimp.  They will also, they come eat the dead, fit the dead skin off your body.  Is that it?  Yeah, because they just, they just nip away, man.  What are we, decomposing?  How much dead skin is there that they're eating? 
[01:03:30]  That is the little, like a leper.  That is the little leper right there.  The yellow tang.  Look how cute it looks.  I'm not sure.  That thing is evil.  I want to cut its little mouth off.  They say that you go through, you lose a certain amount of skin on your body every, I'm not  sure of the timetable, but you guys can look it up.  Is it true?  Your skin regenerates.  Everybody loses.  Your skin regenerates, right?  So they say, let's say, every four minutes?  Exactly.  So, and that's what they're doing.  You've got many layers of skin, and they come over there nipping off the dead layers 
[01:04:00]  of skin.  There you go.  Really?  How do they see it?  What good little eyes they have.  They don't.  They just don't.  Little eyes.  So what little fish are we supposed to look out for?  The yellow tangs, and what was the other one?  It's called a peppermint shrimp.  Let me see a picture of the peppermint shrimp.  It looks like a shrimp, except it's kind of a picture white, and I guess kind of a red.  It's a bug. 
[01:04:30]  That is a bug.  How does that do any damage to you?  It looks like a lobster, but it'll come over and latch onto your body, and it's teed.  It's kind of like a spider.  They'll come over, and they'll start chewing on your fish.  You know, there's no reason to be under there.  Does it hurt?  No, it doesn't really hurt.  It's just an irritation.  A little pep.  I want to have one as a pep.  Yeah.  Put on a little lunch.  I'm punching out.  You guys have fun.  Yeah, we are.  We are.  We are.  Michael, New York.  What's up?  That's some nice useless news.  Yeah.  Nothing. 
[01:05:00]  Michael?  Yeah?  Hello?  How old a gentleman are you?  Uh, 11.  Oh, 11.  Hi, Michael.  How are you?  So, 11-year-old Michael on this fine morning.  How you doing?  Why aren't you in school?  Are you getting ready for school?  Yeah.  Yeah?  What grade are you in?  Uh, sixth.  Sixth grade.  Is your teacher hot?  No.  Not really.  No.  I thought some of my teachers were hot at that age.  You got yourself a girlfriend, do you? 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  You do?  Yeah.  Wow.  What's her name?  Just first name.  Crystal.  What's her name?  Crystal.  Crystal.  Oh, Crystal.  Crystal.  Yeah.  Oh.  Crystal.  Oh, Crystal.  Well, that's nice.  All right, Michael.  Good for you.  Before we get in a lot of trouble, why don't you just tell us why you called, and then we  can move on.  For the slogan?  Oh, the ONA slogan.  We're looking for a new slogan.  Jimmy came up with what, Jimmy? 
[01:06:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Get your hat.  All right, Michael.  What do you got?  If you're feeling down and dopey, listen to Anthony and Opie.  I like it.  I don't like that at all.  It's too long.  I like it.  I like how he switched the names around.  That's fine, but I never was a fan of the Opie Dopey thing.  I think that's very hack, even if you're 11.  Down and dopey.  That's a good rhyme.  No, very good, Michael.  Thank you. 
[01:06:30]  You're welcome.  All right, there you go.  Have a good day at school, young man.  Say hi to Krista.  Yeah.  That's right.  Tell her we missed her.  How's that for a slumber?  See how that hurts?  All right, when we get back, we were supposed to do the poll to see who you would vote for.  This is a great little thing.  It's on a website that we're going to turn everyone on to.  It'll be on onaradio.com later today.  You answer a few questions, and then this website tells you who you should probably vote for.  I can't wait to see who I should vote for. 
[01:07:00]  By the answers you gave to the questions.  We'll do that after the break.  And finally, right after the break, a couple guys from the Touching Rich show on BCN up  there in Boston heckled Hillary, and she had to acknowledge the heckling.  The guy was yelling out, iron my shirt, clear as day, and this has some legs today.  Know why it has legs?  Because Breitbart is reporting on it. 
[01:07:30]  He does all the big stories, doesn't he?  Yeah.  He's a douche.  Got us in trouble.  He was the one that started our little problem.  He's just a yutz.  And so we'll play that, and we'll do the presidential poll thing next as well.  It's Opie and Anthony.  All right, the show's moving quickly.  Opie and Anthony, instant feedback coming in like crazy.  Chris, you from Jersey writes, you all are fools.  Jimmy, this is for you.  You all are fools.  Jessica Simpson was at two games before that. 
[01:08:00]  Mm-hmm.  They blew the teams out.  No jinx, you.  Oops.  No jinx, you F-Os.  Strahan is in the Bahamas, too.  You F-Os.  Stop bringing, stop, bring down the Cowboys.  Oh, shut up.  Stop, bring down the Cowboys.  All right.  Hector V.  Travis from Georgia.  Travis is the offspring of Brutus and olive oil.  If you've seen a picture of Travis, that's good.  And I think Steven S. will work with that on onaradio.com later and put that together. 
[01:08:30]  Sniper from Whackbag, the Opie and Anthony show.  We tally-ate.  We try to come up with a new slogan for the show.  Really fast.  I know we got to take the poll to see who you would vote for for president.  Yes.  And we got the Toucher and Rich audio.  That's really, really good.  But we started something here, and Beth wants to add to it.  Beth in Boston, listening on BCN.  What's up, Beth?  Hi.  Hi.  Hello, young lady.  Thank you. 
[01:09:00]  I heard your stories about Mexico, and it was really funny.  I went to the Czech Republic.  My brother lives in Prague.  So I toured the silver mines in Kutnohora, and it was quite possibly the dangerous thing  I've ever done, and it would never happen in the United States.  Yeah, that's why we're...  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  It was hysterical.  I highly recommend it.  If you ever go to Prague, like go outside the city and visit the silver mines, it's death-defying. 
[01:09:30]  Why was it so dangerous?  Because it's an old...  It's like thousands of years old.  It's narrow.  It's dark.  There's no light.  They said if you're claustrophobic, like don't do this because you can't go back out.  And they gave us these like huge flashlights.  And they said, be careful not to tip the flashlight because you might spill like acid  on you, battery acid on you.  Yeah.  Great.  And then there's like all this water.  The mines are flooded. 
[01:10:00]  So there's all this condensation and water dripping.  And people are like touching the walls and like, I don't know, putting their hand out,  tasting the water.  And the tour guide at one point says, well, the water down here is so high in arsenic that  it will like burn through metal.  That's why there's no like handrails on the stairs because the water eats through the  metal handrail.  And this was a tour that you took.  See, this is the beauty of leaving the United States now. 
[01:10:30]  You just don't realize.  We are so careful when it comes to everything.  We regulate everything in America.  And you realize that you go out of country on vacation and they don't believe in this  stuff.  Yeah.  And I think it's awesome.  And then if people die, they just die.  They drag them out and put them in a hole.  It sucks to be you.  And that's that.  We try to keep people alive too much over here in this country.  That's great.  Thank you, Beth. 
[01:11:00]  You're welcome.  And there's one more before we get into the stuff we want to do this break.  Tim in Jersey.  Go ahead.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Good, Tim.  Hey, I was in the Dominican Republic, right?  And they had, you know, they're doing a little tour thing and they had this tour of this animal  park where you could interact with tiger cubs.  And they show this picture of these two itty bitty little tiger cubs.  And you're thinking, oh, this is going to be great.  It's going to be cool.  Well, they're not cubs anymore.  They're big.  400, 500 pound tigers. 
[01:11:30]  And these people are letting you touch them.  So if you go to the Dominican Republic, you could pet tigers.  Yes.  Can you imagine being able to do that in America at a zoo?  Let you at the San Francisco Zoo.  Well, sure.  You're allowed to pet them.  Well, they hand out slingshots first and then you get an up close.  You get to pet their teeth and their tongue and their throat with your neck.  Right.  Nobody was armed.  Yeah.  They didn't have so much as a stick. 
[01:12:00]  Right.  Yeah.  If he latches onto you.  Oh, well.  They don't care.  Nah.  Why would they?  They don't.  Life is cheap in some of these countries.  Life is cheap.  Holding a tiger on a leash.  Yeah.  A dog leash.  Yeah.  Because that'll hold back a 400, 500 pound tiger.  Yes.  With a 150 pound man holding it.  Yeah.  That's going to work.  There you go.  Well, thank you, Tim.  Sure.  All right.  We'll take more of those.  People are calling with that one big time. 
[01:12:30]  So we set this up earlier, but people tune in and tune out all the time as far as a radio  show goes.  So I got a communique last night from Rich, from the Toucher and Rich show.  Heard on BCN, of course, in afternoons.  And Rich writes, guys, here's a video from Fox News, and we'll put this video up on onaradio.com  later today, of Adolfo.  Is that how you say his name?  Yeah.  Adolfo.  Adolfo. 
[01:13:00]  We met him, by the way, last time we were up at BCN.  He's just a big, quiet creep.  He just sits there.  Yeah.  He's really quiet.  And supposedly, he's the one that was shouting.  Yeah.  Adolfo and intern Nick from our show, the video is of them getting kicked out of Hillary Clinton's  campaign rally in New Hampshire yesterday.  Afterwards, someone who is to be believed from Hillary's campaign called Adolfo a F-face.  And we'll have the video up on onaradio.com later today, but here is the audio. 
[01:13:30]  Some people think you bring about change by demanding it, and some people think you bring  about change by...  Can we turn the lights on?  It's awfully dark here for everybody.  I'm not sure!  I'm not sure!  I'm not sure!  Oh, the remnants of sexism, alive and well!  Are they applauding that? 
[01:14:00]  Yay, sexism, alive and well!  As I think has just been abundantly demonstrated, I am also running to break through the highest  and hardest glass ceiling for our government.  Oh, how nice.  Look at that.  That's a big coup for the Toucher and Rich show right there.  That has legs, by the way.  That thing is going to be all over YouTube. 
[01:14:30]  It's going to be one of the top videos of the day you watch.  Huh?  She's eating apples.  She handled it well.  I mean, she just moved on.  Well, then she tries to joke about it.  There's a little more audio.  One of the things I love about it is, it is never predictable.  And what I want to do tonight is to answer as many of your questions as I possibly can.  Because what I've been doing for the last several days is taking questions on anything  anybody wants to talk about. 
[01:15:00]  If there's anybody still left in the auditorium who wants to learn how to iron his own shirt,  I'll talk about that.  There you go.  Look at him with a witty little comeback.  And I'm looking at the video, which will be posted on onaradio.com.  It's other places right now.  Places we're not allowed to promote for whatever reason.  I gave up on that effing months ago.  The guy's holding up a sign that says Iron My Shirt.  Iron My Shirt.  Yeah.  Iron My Shirt.  That is really just... 
[01:15:30]  That's got to get her right where it hurts.  Congratulations to the Toucher and Rich show.  That's a biggie.  Yeah, that's a good one.  It's just so silly and obnoxious, too.  It's not even vicious.  Iron My Shirt is funny.  Bad could it be?  Okay.  The shirt's wrinkled.  That's a real request.  Pretty close to Hillary, by the way, too.  He wasn't in the back.  He was pretty much front and center.  It looks like he was in the second or third row.  Iron My Shirt.  That is guts.  Let's go to Chris in Texas. 
[01:16:00]  Chris?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  How you doing, Jimmy?  Hi.  Hey, just talking about things you get to do in other countries.  We were in China, just outside of Beijing, and they got this big zoo, kind of like a  petting zoo we have here in the U.S.  And we all know petting zoos.  I'm just helping you out and setting you up a little bit here, Chris.  You know, petting zoos in America, they have, you know, you put your little quarter in.  Yeah.  You get a little feed, and you put it in your hand, and you feel the animals just kind  of taking the feed off your hand, right?  Nibble, hold your hand flat. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  And you get a little nervous because you put your hand in the cage, and they just nibble  away and take what's in your hand, right?  That's a sheep.  Exactly.  A sheep.  That's kind of what you're talking about.  But what are they doing in this zoo outside Beijing?  Well, you are able to spend basically about $30 U.S. to buy a goat or a chicken.  And most people toss them off of these bridges that they have to feed the lion.  You can do that, or you can physically drive your car into this little area, and open your  car door, throw the goat out, and drive away quickly, and just watch as these animals ravage 
[01:17:00]  the poor little goat.  Is the goat alive?  The goat is very much alive.  Jurassic Park.  Right.  What the hell?  So you could heave them over a bridge and watch the lions eat them?  It's about 20 feet up, and they got these cute little signs with the cute little goats  in their cages.  You take them, and you throw them off.  Usually, like, two guys grab them on either side of the legs and just toss it over.  It's great.  Oh, let's see.  There you go.  Not in America. 
[01:17:30]  No.  We have regulations in America.  Can't do that.  It's cruelty to animals.  It'll hurt the children.  Sure.  That's a hell of an experience, though.  Bet you that goat's not happy.  No.  No.  Oof.  And he's so stupid, the goat.  He's probably just going, meh, because he thinks like you're swinging him because it's  a fun ride.  Yeah.  Like you're petting his belly or something.  Yeah.  Right until he smashes on the ground.  Yeah.  It's totally like you let him go, and he realizes, wait a minute, there's lions looking at me.  All before that, though, it was all fun and games with people. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  They're swinging him.  He's like, ah.  He's probably like, ah-ha.  My friends don't get such a lucky ride.  Wait.  No one's holding my hooves anymore, and I'm upside down, plummeting towards lions.  Stupid goat.  Well, there must be a trampoline at the bottom this fall.  Bamboozled me.  I guess I shouldn't have eaten all that stuff in the apartment.  I ate all those canceled checks and paperwork, because I'm a goat.  That's what I do.  Stupid goat.  Oh, they're just idiots.  They're just dumb. 
[01:18:30]  A little bell around his neck.  A little bell.  Oh, right.  Cling, cling, cling, cling, cling.  They have some kind of horn that they have no use for.  Yeah, it's like the devil horns.  Yeah, just devil horns.  We get it, Satan.  Get down there for the lions to eat you.  Yeah, what are you going to do with the horns?  They're like little nubs.  They are awful.  It's their defense against nothing.  Against what?  Against a forceful hatting?  All right.  So there is this website, and we'll put the website up on onaradio.com, and we'll mention 
[01:19:00]  it on the air for you after we take this poll, because we don't want everyone running to  the website now and messing up the bit that we're about to do.  But basically, it gives up pretty serious questions.  You answer the questions.  Dan, you ready?  Yeah.  And, Iraq, you ready?  Because maybe Jimmy could jump on, too, here.  And you answer these questions, and then it tallyates.  Yeah, it tallyates.  I like the word tallyates. 
[01:19:30]  I like making up words.  It's fun.  And it tallyates your answers, and then it tells you who you probably should vote for  to be the next president.  And everyone can take this poll and see where you're at.  All right.  I want to see who I should vote for.  I don't have a clue.  First two questions are a bit long, and then it goes fast.  So just bear with us here.  Okay?  But I think a lot of people are interested to see who this website thinks you should 
[01:20:00]  vote for, Anthony Kuhlman.  Oh, absolutely.  Iraq.  What is your opinion on the war in Iraq?  Multiple choice.  Yes.  Decentralize Iraq by dividing it into regions of separate governments.  Mm-hmm.  Okay?  Draw down the U.S. troops and decentralize Iraq by dividing it into regions of separate  governments.  Mm-hmm.  Okay?  I favor immediate and orderly withdrawal of U.S. troops.  Mm-hmm.  There should be a timetable for the removal of U.S. troops. 
[01:20:30]  We're going to be in Iraq for a long time as a support force for the Iraqi government and  forces.  Mm-hmm.  Or, finally, U.S. forces need to stay in Iraq for as long as it takes for Iraqi forces  to take over.  What is your answer?  There's a few of those answers that are kind of similar.  Yeah, but at this point right now, it could change over time.  Mm-hmm.  I got to go with six.  Oh, you're keeping track.  Wow, look at you.  Yeah.  One, two, three, four. 
[01:21:00]  So, the last one.  U.S. forces need to stay in Iraq for as long as it takes for Iraqi forces to take over.  Yeah, at this point.  Okay.  My opinion could change because I'm not running for president.  I can change my mind.  All right, Jimmy, you want in on this timetable?  Uh, there was a few timetables, weren't there?  No, there's only one.  People will always wait out a timetable.  Oh, no, you're probably right, but I don't care about the Iraqis or their freedom.  Okay.  I don't either.  All right.  And the U.S. could leave with dignity if we do that.  Maybe we can't.  Too bad.  I don't either.  Are you typing it out on the website?  Yeah, I'm doing Anthony to keep the time of what I'm doing. 
[01:21:30]  No.  No, you idiot.  I'm doing Anthony.  I told you, Than is doing Anthony.  You do to me.  How did you get that?  Now, who's doing me, Iraq, if not you?  Oh, my God.  Please, Iraq.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, then you have to answer this.  Importance to your answer.  Oh.  Not important all the way to very important, one through four.  So one would be not important.  Four would be very important or somewhere in the middle.  Well, I would give it a three.  A three.  Jimmy?  I'd say the same.  Three. 
[01:22:00]  Okay, let's move on.  Immigration.  What is your position on immigration in the United States?  Build a fence along the border.  I'm opposed to granting legal status to illegal immigrants.  B, tighten security first, but I also believe we should provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who are already here.  I guess I'll just cross that one out.  I'm not going to be stupid here. 
[01:22:30]  All right.  And it's not even going to acknowledge I read that one.  C, I favor stiff fines for employers who hire illegal immigrants, a security fence along the border, and a denial of citizenship to children born here of parents who are in the U.S. illegally.  I oppose any form of amnesty.  Yep.  And D, I favor a guest worker program while tightening border security.  What's your answer, Anthony?  The second to last one.  C, I favor stiff fines for employers who hire illegal immigrants, a security fence along the border, and a denial of citizenship to children born here of parents who are in the U.S. illegally. 
[01:23:00]  Absolutely.  Okay.  Stop raping us.  It's not illegal immigration.  It's an invasion.  All right.  And, Jimmy?  I'm going to say B, I want the borders tightened and security, but I want some kind of a path to citizenship.  I don't mind that if it's a path that they follow.  The Jews!  What?  I just thought I'd blurt that out.  All right.  I just want a path that they have to follow and then no more coming in. 
[01:23:30]  All right.  And importance, once again, not important one, very important four, or somewhere in between.  Four!  Four!  This is one of the biggest problems facing this country today.  All right.  Jimmy?  Go to Southern California.  What used to be Southern California.  It is now Northern Mexico.  All right.  Thank you.  Jimmy?  I'm enjoying this apple picked by one of those fine gentlemen, so I'm going to say it's a  three.  A three.  All right.  Grimy hand on it.  Now the questions are a lot shorter. 
[01:24:00]  We got the two biggies out of the way.  Taxes!  Uh-oh.  Do you believe the two...  I don't...  I...  And some of these questions you don't even have to answer, by the way.  Mm-hmm.  They just kind of throw that question...  Oh, I'll answer.  All right.  Taxes.  Do you believe the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts should be made permanent?  Yes or no, Anthony?  Yes.  All right.  Jimmy?  If it said tax cuts, yes.  All right.  Yes for both guys, and importance, not important one, very important four, we're somewhere in 
[01:24:30]  the middle.  I'll give it a three.  A three?  That one a four.  Tax cut.  Okay.  Stem cell research.  Mm-hmm.  Should federal funding of embryonic stem cell research be expanded?  Yes or no?  Yes for...  Absolutely the same answer.  All right.  I think little fetishes should be used as softballs after we're done, too.  Care less about the little things. 
[01:25:00]  All right.  If it could help cure diseases, yank out those stem cells.  Right.  While the kid is yelling, hey, let me go.  Hey, what are you doing?  Those are my stem cells, mister.  Put them back.  Health care, Anthony Cumia.  Mm-hmm.  Getting more and more dramatic here.  Yeah.  Do you favor or oppose the concept of...  Mm-hmm.  Oh, boy, no.  Very...  Where did it go?  I just know this guy.  Health care.  Do you favor or oppose the concept of universal health care in America? 
[01:25:30]  Oppose or favor Anthony?  Now, this is interesting.  See, you think I would just say I oppose it.  Right.  But I really don't.  But there's so many different ways that nobody has come up with to do this.  Right.  You know, I don't want the system like in Canada.  Okay.  But I favor some type of universal health care.  Yes.  That's the concept.  It's not about the concept.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  I do favor.  You both favor.  So, importance.  Not important one, very important four. 
[01:26:00]  No, no.  I'm kidding.  I'd give it a three.  A three, Jimmy?  I would, too.  People just think I'm copying Anthony.  Okay.  No.  I had a couple different...  Me and Jimmy are actually very similar in our ideology.  We both like...  And our sexual...  Abortion!  Do you favor or oppose legalized abortion in the United States of America?  Anthony.  Any kind.  Legal, illegal.  I love abortion. 
[01:26:30]  No one ever says they love abortion.  It's like, I'll tolerate it.  I'll put up with it.  Opie and Anthony, they love abortion.  I am for a woman's right to choose.  It's her body.  By the way, you can start sending in your audio slogans for the Opie and Anthony show.  That'll be fun to listen to.  A little production.  A little zing zingers and lasers and stuff would be fun.  All right?  Dramatic voices.  Deep voices.  Whatever.  So, that game is on.  All right.  Abortion.  I oppose abortion. 
[01:27:00]  You're for it.  I am against it.  Wow.  You're really against abortion?  No.  No.  I didn't want people to think I'm copying Anthony.  I'm for it.  I'm for it whether you want one or not.  All right.  So, you're both favored.  I don't have to get one of those abortions.  You both favor the abortion thing.  Yeah.  And the importance.  Not important one.  Very important four.  Anthony.  I think as far as the election goes, for me, it's not very important.  I put it at a two.  A two.  And Jimmy? 
[01:27:30]  Three.  Three.  I'm not like a crazy person.  Social security!  Social security!  Ah!  Social security.  Social security.  Do you favor the concept of privatization of social security to any degree?  I don't understand what it entails to privatize it.  It basically means you get a little financial advisor or something and say, hey, this is what  I want.  Here's your money.  It was going into social security, into the government program that's going broke.  Right.  Instead, you have more of a say as to where the money goes. 
[01:28:00]  Right.  And, and, uh...  Get yourself a little portfolio together.  Yeah.  Get a little return on it.  But the risk there is that if you're stupid with your investing, you're going to lose your  social security money and be poor and destitute.  Thank you.  I think the fact that we have to privatize, we can't even take care of our old people who  built the country, we should just be all shot as a selfish nation.  Hmm.  Sorry.  No, I think, I think that's one thing that we, the government should handle.  No, no position.  Yes.  Anthony, I am in favor of, uh, privatizing social security as long as, uh, something is put 
[01:28:30]  in place, a safety is put in place.  Hey, don't, that's mumbo jumbo.  Yes, I do.  I do.  And I'll give it a two as important.  All right.  Not important is one.  Very important for you.  Give it a two.  And Jimmy, uh, I'll give it, I'll give it a two as well.  And you say yes to this?  Uh, am I, what's the question again?  No, no position or yes.  Am I for privatizing it?  Yeah.  I wish I knew more about it.  Well, the concept. 
[01:29:00]  Uh, I'm going to say, uh, I'm going to say no, because for some reason it just seems  to me like some old people are going to get screwed, but I could be wrong about that  one.  I don't know much about that.  So I'm going to say no.  All right.  I apologize.  What was, uh, what was Ant's importance on the, uh?  A two.  Two.  And Jimmy, you're at work?  Give it a dose.  A dose.  Yeah.  A dose.  All right.  Line item veto.  Wow.  What is it?  What is it?  Do you favor or oppose giving the president a line item veto? 
[01:29:30]  That is the ability to remove parts of a spending bill without needing to veto the entire bill.  Anthony Cumia, um, favor or oppose?  I, I'm in favor of the line item veto.  I don't like the way they put, um, uh, certain, uh, uh, laws, uh, or, or, um, policy on these  things and send it off to the president.  And then he's got to veto the whole thing because, uh, you know, in the stem cell research  thing, you've also put, uh, fixing potholes somewhere. 
[01:30:00]  You know, it doesn't, it doesn't make sense.  That never made sense to me.  So, yeah, I am for the line item veto.  And Jimmy?  Well, uh, I, I am for it as well.  I don't care for line items and he should be able to veto the concept of a line item.  And the importance?  I put the importance at three.  Three.  I'll give it a two since she said three.  Okay.  Energy!  Ah, yes, I'm for it.  I'm against it.  I want us all to be slow and relaxed. 
[01:30:30]  Do you support federal assistance for the production of ethanol and or biofuel as an alternative  to oil?  Yes or no?  Anthony Cumia.  Federal assistance.  Um, yeah, yeah.  I think in the long run it'll help out.  Yeah.  Uh, important?  At this point in time, importance at two.  Two.  So not that important.  I'm more for invading more countries with oil.  Uh, Jimmy?  Venezuela for one.  I'm going to say, uh, yes, I support it. 
[01:31:00]  And it's a three for me.  Little Jim, little green Jimmy Norton.  Wow.  Look at you.  Jimmy green jeans.  It's my new name.  And why would you, uh, say that?  Because I think...  Marriage!  Ah.  Marriage.  Do you favor or oppose a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one  woman, Anthony Cumia?  Uh, no.  I think that's ridiculous.  So you oppose?  Yes, yes.  The Constitution is not meant to put restrictions like that. 
[01:31:30]  It's, it's, uh, ridiculous.  Important's not important or very important.  I could give a fly enough.  Or somewhere in between.  Tell you the truth.  Uh, one.  Yeah, I give it a...  One or two.  It's a one.  As far as, you know, something, as far as importance in, in the election and things,  that's a one.  Just stop already.  All right.  I would say, uh, I, I favor an amendment saying that a marriage is actually the union  of two men.  I really want to change this.  Nice.  No, I'm against that stupid constitutional amendment. 
[01:32:00]  Because you want them to be able to suffer like us, right?  Oh, God, that's a good one.  Wow.  No, you didn't.  Oh.  Shut up.  I would say I'd give it a two as well.  It's not, it's not on the top of my priori list.  Priori list.  Death penalty!  Hmm.  Do you favor?  This is not good for my voice.  That only came back yesterday, by the way.  These were me and Jimmy part ways. 
[01:32:30]  Do you favor or oppose the use of the death penalty for certain crimes?  Anthony Cumia, oppose or favor?  All crimes.  Death.  Favor.  Yes, I'm in favor.  Important?  Uh, four.  That's as high as you go.  I am very, very for the death penalty.  All right, Jimmy?  I am, uh, I'm for it as well.  Oh!  My problem is never with the death penalty, theoretically. 
[01:33:00]  My problem is the fact that I think that we're not perfect enough to use it, but I would  prefer to vote for a guy who is theoretically for it.  Ah.  Okay.  Interesting.  Because, yeah, the states are going to do what they want anyway.  That's, I believe, a state issue.  So, I'm going to say a three.  A three.  Wow, look at that.  Okay.  Gun control.  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  Gun control!  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Agree or disagree?  Anthony Cumia.  When the government places restrictions on obtaining and owning a gun, they infringe upon 
[01:33:30]  our rights to bear arms.  Agree.  Absolutely.  That's three, though.  Agree, partially agree, disagree.  Agree.  I agree, agree.  Agree, agree.  Uh, importance.  Yes, that's a four for me.  All right.  That is, uh, uh, a cornerstone, uh, of our Constitution.  One of the original, uh, rights given to us, the right to bear arms, and, uh, any infringement  on that should be met with stiff resistance. 
[01:34:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, all right.  All right.  Sieg, oh, thank you, I mean.  Hey, hey, hey.  Jesus.  Hey, hey, Jimmy.  It's like just getting carried away for a second.  Agree, partially agree, disagree.  Could you rephrase it?  Just say the question again, because I'm mistaken.  Gun control.  Uh, when the government places restrictions on obtaining and owning a gun, they infringe upon  our rights to bear arms.  I disagree.  Disagree.  All right.  Not partially agree.  You're a mad person.  No, I'll tell you why.  No, I don't agree at all.  Okay.  I'll tell you why.  Because banning it is one thing, but putting restrictions, like wanting a background check, 
[01:34:30]  we absolutely as a society have the right to say, I want a background check on this horse's  ass before I let him go and purchase a nine millimeter.  I want people to be able to get one, but I don't think placing restrictions, there's restrictions  on driving, there's restrictions on everything.  I mean, I don't mind public safety.  You don't have the right to drive in the Constitution, my friend.  That's true.  It's not the right to drive.  It is our right to bear arms.  No, that's not fair, because there was no driving when the Constitution was written.  Yes, there was.  But no one's taking away the right to bear arms.  Of course there wasn't.  There's no, no, the right to bear arms does exist. 
[01:35:00]  Go ahead, buy a gun.  Buy a gun in New York City right now.  Go ahead.  Go ahead and buy one.  It might be hard.  It might be impossible.  But I'm not saying that all the restrictions are correct.  What I'm saying is they do have the right to put restrictions.  That doesn't mean they're not going to put too many, but does the government have the  right to restrict citizens from purchasing guns?  Yes.  I don't think that anyone should just be able to go out and get any one they want.  I think, well, read the question again.  Gun control, agree or disagree?  When the government places restrictions on obtaining and owning a gun, they infringe upon  our rights to bear arms. 
[01:35:30]  Places restrictions on obtaining and owning.  Does it mean, if that said, when the government bans the personal ownership of guns, I would  agree with you.  Well, restrictions start the road to banning.  That's what they do.  You're right, but slippery slope, I can't argue a slippery slope thing because you can  get anywhere with slippery slope.  So you disagree, Jimmy?  Yeah, of course.  All right.  And your importance?  I would say that's a three.  Three.  Very good.  Okay.  Four.  We have two questions left.  The environment. 
[01:36:00]  Get rid of it.  It's for queers.  Do environment.  Owls.  I want to twist their little heads around, see how far they can really go.  I want to see how big its eye can get when I continually punch it.  Ask that question again.  Stupid one word, Johnny.  Have a wise potato chip while I put an arrow in you.  Owls.  Stupid down syndrome noise they make. 
[01:36:30]  Hey, look, it's a bird.  A wise old owl.  Is he wise?  Exactly.  Stands in the dark like a creep.  Lurking.  With a trench coat.  Do environmental regulations improve or limit the standard of living?  The answers are a little long.  A little longer.  Improve, meaning a healthy environment sustains life now and in the future.  Right.  Limit, focusing on the environment, halts advances in technology and transportation and undecided. 
[01:37:00]  Anthony Cumia.  I will say, based on what I've seen and read, that these things do take away from technology, innovation, transportation, energy.  So you're going with limit.  Yes.  And, Jimmy?  Say the question again.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Let me.  So limit, importance. 
[01:37:30]  Three.  Three, which means pretty important.  Pretty important.  Okay.  Jimmy, the question once again.  Do environmental regulations improve or limit the standard of living?  I think they improve.  Improve, meaning a healthy environment sustains life now and in the future.  Yes.  Okay.  And importance.  I give it a three.  Three.  All right.  Finally, the final question, education, education, don't need it.  Absolutely.  Just don't need it.  Get into radio. 
[01:38:00]  That's right.  Fall into radio.  Should teachers receive pay?  No.  We should whip them for every lesson they don't teach properly.  They're overpaid.  Those bums.  Three months off in the summer.  Exactly.  Stop it.  Lazy Larry's.  That's right.  Should teachers receive pay based on the performance of their students?  Interesting question.  Just say the color. 
[01:38:30]  No.  Yes, no, or sometimes.  Anthony Cumia.  I'm going to say no.  I don't think that's fair to the teacher.  You know, you want to be a good person and a good teacher and maybe go into an underprivileged  neighborhood and teach.  It's very noble.  So why should you take a pay cut?  Because these kids are going to be harder to teach and maybe not as successful as if  you lived in a much nicer neighborhood.  They're still doing the same job and maybe even a better job. 
[01:39:00]  Why should they get less money?  No, not important or very important or somewhere.  Oh, I could care less.  No, I'll say two.  Two.  So not that important.  And Jimmy, your answer.  Sometimes.  Sometimes, okay.  Sometimes.  Yeah.  And your importance?  I'll give it a dose.  A dose.  It's time to tally eight.  Tally eight.  Hit that button there.  Tabule.  And it's going to say find your candidate and we will tell you.  Oh, boy.  Don't even show anybody. 
[01:39:30]  After the break.  I'm so excited.  I want to know who I should.  Oh, someone blew it for me.  Don't even.  They said Paul R. Nelson.  Oh, okay.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Turn off all screens because some of these bastards have found the website that we're  going to turn everyone on to after the break.  And also after the break.  I've pulled down the pal talk thing so I can't read it.  All right.  According to the answers that Anthony gave and the answers Jimmy gave, we're going to  tell you what this website.  Mitt Romney. 
[01:40:00]  What this website suggests you should vote for for the next president of the United States  of America.  Mine is probably going to be Adolf Hitler.  We'll tell you the answer next after the break, okay?  And Rich Voss joined the program as well.  And yes, Jimmy.  And isn't, on this break, aren't I doing another live read?  Oh!  That's right, folks.  Don't turn away.  One Vision live read.  I'm so happy.  Yes.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:40:30]  Are we back on the air?  Yes, Jimmy.  Oh, good.  Because I'm a tool.  I was so excited.  For those of you around the country, I'm doing my first live reads for One Vision.  I got my LASIK surgery, and I couldn't wait to do these.  I actually called Tom.  I'm like, when can I do my live reads?  And so I get the paper, and I do it right, and I put my personal touch.  Yeah.  Tell them the truth.  Yeah.  And what I want to do is really talk them up, and then like an ass, forget to give out  the phone number. 
[01:41:00]  So you can all just look at your phone and hope that Matt and One Vision calls you.  That's what happens, folks.  They sense when you need LASIK, and they just call you at home.  So call One Vision for a complimentary.  It's a complimentary LASIK exam.  It's 1-800-926-2015.  The exam is free.  1-800-926-2015.  That's 1-800-926-2015.  Or don't call them.  Just stand there and hope they mail you something. 
[01:41:30]  As a matter of fact, they'll actually bring the doctors to your house and do the surgery  right there.  Because they just know.  That's the way I do live read.  I just tell you the name, and you figure the rest out.  What's the matter with me?  All right.  Going to the instant feedback, Rum Runner from Whack Bag, Springfield, New Jersey.  He writes, I missed part of the show.  Did Ant answer how he felt about applying censors to the young Vietnamese prostitutes?  Ah, yes.  That was a big thing in the Paul R. Nelson campaign.  And the Ron kind.  Wrong kind.  That's right.  That's a very good.  Smug idiot. 
[01:42:00]  We love callbacks on the Opium Anthony show.  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, Ant's politics fall just to the right of Mussolini.  Hey, he kept the trains on time.  So, if you're just tuning in, too bad.  We had a lot of fun.  We were taking a little poll.  There's a website.  We're going to give the website in a minute or two here, and it will be linked up on onaradio.com.  Also want to thank Tara from the Philly crew for bringing this to my attention last night.  Nice.  As she was talking to her fine young daughter. 
[01:42:30]  So, and it made for some good radio today.  Bunch of questions.  Anthony and Jim answered them before the break.  And then you hit a little tally eight button.  Tally eight?  It tally eights who you should be voting for president.  I realize, by the way, I'm turning into a liberal.  I do know that.  Right.  Oof.  I don't know.  I just, I find my views are changing a little bit.  Your girlfriend.  Aw.  All right.  Oh, my girlfriend.  No.  Your girlfriend.  She hates the racist stuff I say.  We fought 30 times off my racist remarks.  And Steven S. from Bayshore.  Did Voss get that hat off the set of Bugsy Malone? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Bugsy Malone.  We'll get to Voss and his stupid hat.  What are you out front going, X-tree, X-tree, read all about it.  I got this when I was in X-tree and Gatsby.  The great Gatsby.  You got, cool, same joke twice.  Oh, did he say Bugsy Malone?  Yeah.  The great Gatsby was a way to be prepared for the Open Anthem show.  Come on, I'll be matured.  I didn't come with my hat material this morning, sorry.  You should have, because Jimmy's got the new slogan of the Open Anthony show. 
[01:43:30]  Yes, I do.  Open Anthony, get your hat.  And Rich did.  And you did, Rich.  So did you, Anthony.  So did young Fannikins.  Fannikin.  I'm going to have my hat tomorrow.  And so did Iraq.  He should.  Well, no, he is.  He's wearing like one of those little, uh, I wish I could remember.  What are those little, uh, those little balls you hold?  They have like the little fuzzy on the, I can't.  Male prostitute.  Oh, hey, right on, boss.

And this website will be up on onaradio.com  So you can check  So you can do the same thing at home  There's 15 candidates  Pretty much anybody  Pretty much  15  Yeah  And I do mean anybody as we'll see from  Oh boy  Did I pick a winner?  According to the answers  Who should Anthony be voting for  As far as his website goes?  None other than  Duncan Hunter 
[01:49:00]  Duncan Hunter?  What?  What's Duncan Hunter's platform?  Let me see  Who the hell is Duncan?  Oh we got info  Here's info on Duncan Hunter  I didn't even know  My candidate Opie  Most major polls don't list him as an option  He has been excluded from debate forums for Republican candidates  Republican congressmen from California  Why was he excluded?  I don't know  There's got to be more to that  I'm sure that doesn't say Jew Hunter  Former  Former chairman of the House Armed Services Committee 
[01:49:30]  He's a Vietnam vet  Army Ranger 75th Ranger Regiment  Participated in 24 helicopter assaults  Held rank of first lieutenant  Awarded Bronze Star Medal and Air Medal  Has introduced legislation to build fences on the U.S.-Mexico border  Repeatedly votes against international trade agreements  Such as NAFTA, CAFTA, and the WTO  And you missed one  What?  He does good at Call of Duty 4  He plays Call of Duty 4 
[01:50:00]  The results will come and go  And from New York  One vote  Duncan Hunter  Anthony  You know what?  Oh god  Duncan Hunter  Duncan Hunter  Now I don't know this guy  But after reading his little resume here  It's pretty accurate  Very quickly  You did mention Call of Duty 4  I want to give out my name so that people can be friends with me on there  It's U-Stink 2 
[01:50:30]  Okay  So the word U-Stink and the number 2 is my name  And you were saying you were kind of low on friends?  Yeah, yeah  Because I never gave my name out  Okay  On the radio  How many percent was that for Duncan Hunter?  43  Do you want the next actual candidate?  Yeah, the next  Like the first realistic person?  Why?  Who's the second choice for Anthony?  Rudy Giuliani  I thought so  Okay  With 39  Alright, so Rudy was very close  Right behind Duncan Hunter 
[01:51:00]  And the third choice, I guess  McCain  Is, yeah  Next  So that's pretty accurate  According to the answers you gave  Yeah, yeah  Except for this Duncan Hunter  That we don't know  Who's Duncan Hunter?  Well, he's my guy  Duncan Hunter  Now if someone goes  Who are you voting for?  I'm going to go  Duncan Hunter  Duncan Hunter  And now I know  Alright, now we go to  E-Rock  Who is keeping track of Jimmy's answers  Jim Norton  According to his website  Should be voting for who?  Jimmy Tide 
[01:51:30]  For first place  Absolutely  Man keeps clean shirts  Oh boy  Okay, terrific  I'm Detective John Kimball  You're fired  Who was it?  Jimmy should be voting for Barack Obama 
[01:52:00]  Or Hillary Clinton  Both at 44  Both at 44  And who was third?  Third is Chris Dodd  Wait, wait, wait  You really didn't come across as that much different, right?  I'll tell you probably a few of the immigration answers  There was a few  It wasn't that much of a difference  Which shows you how close most  For you it's the guy so conservative  He can't be able to  The gun control answer  It's probably the few answers that made us different  Yeah  Your guy is a problem  Is he a problem? 
[01:52:30]  That's why this website is perfect  Is he a problem?  Duncan Hunter is a problem  That means  I want to learn more about Duncan Hunter  My candidate for president  This website is very accurate  PJ, we're learning more about Duncan  From Philadelphia  He writes  Duncan Hunter was that ass  That held the press conference  Where he read off the menu  For the prisoners of Gitmo  Then proceed to sit down  And eat the meal  He just described  At the end of the press conference  That makes sense  Why should they be eating such good food? 
[01:53:00]  Yeah  Hey, what  They should be being waterboard tortured  By the way  I brought this to the show  Thanks to the Philly crew and Tara  And I did the poll last night  And I'm pretty close to Jimmy actually  I didn't get to third  Maybe I could call home and find out  But they said  That I should vote for Hillary  37%  Jimmy had Hillary at 44%  And second was Barack at 36% 
[01:53:30]  So almost identical to Jimmy  It was like very close with Barack and Hillary  What was my percentage with Duncan?  43  43  Okay  I have a good joke  Who should I vote for?  Barack Obama  And Hillary Clinton  No  Oh, you want us to ask the question?  No, I was asking  Because it was the first choice  Who's my first choice, Iraq?  Barack Obama  And Hillary Clinton  Tied  Oh 
[01:54:00]  Oh my God  Oh, what happened?  Oh no  Oh, wait a minute  Let me  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  This might mean a special  Oh my God  Hold on  Let me  Get set up  If you knew how stupid  I was  Hold on  Oh no  Does anybody understand what I did?  Not yet  No, I'm trying to figure it out  This is why my joke  Bombed so horribly  Alright  I swear to God 
[01:54:30]  When you said  Jimmy Tied  I thought that was the name of a candidate  Oh my God  Hence the shirt joke  That's why I said  The man loves clean shirts  Jimmy Tied  Back to the warning track  Right near the wall  Leaping  And he made the catch  Carlos Beltran right  No, he didn't  Oh  My apologies 
[01:55:00]  I thought he had it  I thought he had it too  He acted as though he had it  He did not have it  I made an ass  Of myself  I'm sorry  Sometimes I'm a bad boy  Yeah  I'm embarrassed that I did that  Razzle dazzle  No  No  Oh my  I tell you something  How does that not go in?  Back goes Griffey  Looking up  And it's out of here  Or is it?  No, it's off the wall  My mistake  Does anybody remember last day? 
[01:55:30]  Jimmy Tied  Is the new candidate for president  Who do you want for vice president?  Jimmy neck to neck?  Thanks  All right  All right  Just bailed him out  Absolutely  Wow  It was horrendous  It was horrendous  I never would have thought that  But there's so many weird candidates  I thought like  Anthony had that guy  I swear I'm not being  I really thought that that was  The guy I just didn't know  Like some obscure Democrat  Yeah, wow  Jimmy Tied  A lot of people are 
[01:56:00]  Coming up with  Jimmy Tied  And oh  Duncan Hunter  And Jimmy Tied  Oh wait  Wow  All right  Hey  We have to take a break  We got Rich Voss in studio  And we're going to go to break  With something that people  Have been requesting  Since we played it the first time  The Count  From Sesame Street  The bleep game  With The Count  Was a song we all  Pretty much grew up  Listening to  It sounds a little different  When you kind of bleep it  And we'll play this  As we go to break  On the Opie and Anthony Shoe 
[01:56:30]  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  You know that I am called  The Count  Because I really love to  Sometimes I sit and  All day  But sometimes I get carried away  I f*** slowly, slowly, slowly 
[01:57:00]  Getting faster  Once I start in f***ing  It's very hard to stop  Faster, faster  It is so exciting  I could f*** forever, f*** until I drop  1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2  I love f***ing whatever the amount  1, 2, 3, 4, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, that's the song of the count 
[01:57:30]  I f*** the spiders on the wall  I f*** the cobwebs in the hole  I f*** the candles on the shelf  When I'm alone, I f*** myself  Oh, yeah, I f*** slowly, slowly, slowly getting faster 
[01:58:00]  Once I start getting f***ing, it's very hard to stop  Faster, faster, it is so exciting  I could f*** forever, f*** until I drop  1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2  I love f***ing whatever the amount  1, 2, 3, 4, hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah, yeah  1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, that's the song of the count 
[01:58:30]  Hey, really fast, before the break  We forgot to give the website out where you could take the same poll  We did to see who you should be voting for  We've got to give credit to WQAD.com  And that link will be up on ONARadio.com later today  WQAD.com  And NH from New Hampshire, Jay, I'm sorry  Has a great idea on instant feedback  Let's do the Google bomb today  And punch in Jimmy Tide, 08 
[01:59:00]  Jimmy Tide  Jimmy Tide, Tide, T-I-D-E, 08  Jimmy Tide, 08  Let's make that the number one search today on Google  Thanks to Jimmy Norton  It's Tide, but it has the, what's that, those two dots over the E?  The umlaut, it's Tide for the umlaut over the E  Jimmy Tide, T-I-D-E, 08  Let's Google the hell out of that today  Alright, more in just a bit  It's Opie and Anthony  Heading into a speed round here on the Opie and Anthony show 
[01:59:30]  I want to thank Toucher and Rich for bringing to our attention that audio  From their show, it was great  Should play it one more time before we get out of here  I'm thinking  Toucher and Rich, the kings of afternoons up there in Boston  On WBCN  Basically, they had a couple of their guys go to the New Hampshire thing  A little primary 
[02:00:00]  My ears are so clogged I can't even hear myself right now  What?  Oh, it's brutal  What?  And one of their guys stood up with a big sign and said, iron my shirt  And started screaming it as Hillary's trying to talk  And this video is going to be huge today  No doubt in my mind  It's going to be one of the biggest downloads on YouTube today  Voss, did you see this one yet?  Check this out  Voss, this is the guys up at BCN  What they were doing the last day or two 
[02:00:30]  Some people think you bring about change by demanding it  And some people think you bring about change by...  I am my shirt!  I am my shirt!  I am my shirt!  I am my shirt!  Can we turn the lights on?  It's awfully dark here for everybody  I am my shirt!  I am my shirt!  I am my shirt!  Oh, the remnants of sexism alive and well  As I think has just been abundantly demonstrated 
[02:01:00]  I am...  I am also running to break through the highest and hardest last ceiling  Oh, God  I mean, she tried, whatever  Yeah, it's a rough one  Yeah, but make sure you listen to Touching Rich today  They'll have a lot to say about what you just heard  Iron my shirt 
[02:01:30]  Iron my shirt!  But Shanty and Iron my shirt!  Iron!  We've done some ballsy things in our day  And that's a biggie right there  That's a good one  They heckled a presidential candidate  That is a biggie  And you know what?  They're public speaking  It's allowable  It's not illegal  It's threatening her  It's being silly  I'd have liked it to end with  Don't tase me, bro  Right  I think Toucher would have liked that, too  Yeah  We're getting ready to play  What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show  Voss, you plugging anything? 
[02:02:00]  What are you doing?  You alright?  I'm just  I'm plugging  Sorry for my unfunniness last break  I'm just in stomach pain  Voss has pain  And also, we were watching the awful footage  That I told you about  With a guy trying to climb out the window  Of the Trade Center  And slipping and falling  And Voss asked  Was that from when the planes hit?  And he wasn't kidding  Jesus  What?  The smoke was pouring out  No, no, see  That's where you're wrong  There was no smoke  When I saw it  It's just a guy climbing down the building  Look, look, look  Okay, but where  Jesus, how is that not? 
[02:02:30]  How is that not from 9-11?  That's all smoke  And there's a hole right above him  I didn't see that part  I saw a little screen  A little screen  There wasn't any smoke  Oh boy  Well, whatever  It's not a pleasant little video  Nothing to talk about  No, no  Alright, not with stomach pain  I'm in Iowa this week  In Penguins  I go the week after  I always miss everything  By like a week  You were there like last week  You would have got a lot of the  Political people coming to see you  I know  I mean, yeah  And they would have left going 
[02:03:00]  Wow, America is dumb  They all would have left  Send that in jail  Everybody was in Iowa  Wow, why are we trying so hard?  Voss has a tummy ache  Yeah  It's more than a tummy ache  Is it?  Yeah  I don't know  It's a lot of pain  I've been in pain  He has real stomach pain  For a long time though  Yeah  Might be ulcers  I don't know  I'm going to go with ulcers  Could it be that  Or could it be  We said Voss' appendix 
[02:03:30]  You're still in  Yeah, but that's  Very localized pain  I don't remember  Because I had them  When I was a kid  Right off to the side  That's pretty much  What you feel like  Yeah, it's down there  You'd feel it like  They say you know  When that thing's ready to burst  So where is it, Rich?  Let's see  It travels around  It travels  A little, yeah  From where to where?  So like the middle  Like  Middle  From down  It's your stomach though  That's your stomach  Yeah  Oh boy  Oh, that's my stomach, really? 
[02:04:00]  I'm just  I thought it was a knee  No, because it could be  Like your intestines down there  Or any higher  It could be, you know  Even a lung issue  Or  Right below the  There's a lot of crap  In that area  Yeah, solar flexors  Around  A lot of  But I think  Wait, wait  It's right behind your what?  You what?  I said the solar flexors  Or solar  I don't know what I said  The solar flexors  It's behind the exercise machine  In his stomach  Behind your solar flexors  Right next to the Marcy gym 
[02:04:30]  It's behind the solar flexors  Whatever  It's  50 years old  A lot of pain  And you should be in pain  So am I for just hearing that  And realizing you're my friend  Solar flexors  Solo flex  Hey, really fast  We're in speed round here  And people are starting to call  For what did we learn  Clemens though  We got the press conference audio  A couple key clips from that  That we haven't got to yet  Yeah  A clip of the taped phone call 
[02:05:00]  So what's this about, Anthony?  What do you know?  Well, what I know is  He's doing a perfect job  At damage control  Clemens  All you gotta do is get out there  Well, he's been accused of  Using steroids  He was on that list that came out  And  All you gotta do is get out there  And deny it  And then you start doing  Counter-accusations  And  It puts enough doubt  In people's minds  Where they're like  First of all  People don't really care  About the steroid thing much  No 
[02:05:30]  So that if you put enough doubt  In their mind  They really don't care  So it's not gonna affect them  And I  I think he's got  A tape recording of  Who is this?  His  Trainer  His trainer, yeah  Um  Ex-trainer  Kind of  Like losing it on the phone  A little bit  Right  His trainer comes off  Like a bit of a kook  And  I don't know  It kind of makes  I think it makes Clemens  Look pretty good  All right  We got  Aside from the fact  That he's recording people  Yeah  He knew he was recording  Secret agent  Wait, the other guy  Knew he was recording? 
[02:06:00]  No, only Clemens did  Yeah, Clemens did  And he played it  During this press conference  Yesterday  The pain this is causing  You and me  And everybody  Is nonsense  I just need to come out  I don't have any money  I have nothing  I'm not doing a book deal  I'm not doing any  I got seven figures  To go on TV  I didn't do it  I didn't take it  I didn't do anything  All I did was  What I thought  Was right  And  I never thought it was right  But I thought that  I had no other choice  I learned from you  How to raise my kids 
[02:06:30]  For the life of me  I'm trying to find out  Why you would tell guys  That I use steroids  Tell me what you want me to do  I'm firing my lawyers  I'm getting rid of everybody  I have nothing  What do you want me to do?  My wife is gone  My kids are gone  What do you want me to do?  I don't know if that makes  Clemens look good though  Because  The trainer is almost  Going look  I did it  But  I don't think the trainer  Is admitting to lying  Never once did Clemens  During that interview  Say  Admit I didn't take steroids 
[02:07:00]  Right right right  When you say  Why would you tell me  Why would you tell people  I took steroids  And he's just  What do you want me to do?  I'm really confused  By that audio  Yeah but that's great  For Clemens  Because all you gotta do  Is throw enough confusion  In there  You don't have to prove  That you're right  Or wrong  Or anything  Just throw enough confusion  Throw some sound bites around  Right  That people won't understand  Why he's throwing them around  And enough doubts out there  Because it sounds like  The guy was doing the right thing  Well both of them  But Clemens  No one's committing there  Neither did the other guy 
[02:07:30]  The other guy didn't say  Well you did steroids  And  He might have in the other part of the tape  There's a lot of that conversation  That wasn't released  Yeah  Oh so Clemens has just given you  How many  17 minutes of it last night  Was that most of the call?  Yeah  Oh that's kind of key to the story  17 minutes is a long tape  And he kept saying  What do you want me to do  And Clemens never said  Well admit I didn't use steroids  But  Neither  And the other guy  The trainer never said  You did do steroids  So  You know what I mean  Maybe he never got to  Maybe though Rich  Because the trainer is going 
[02:08:00]  Under the guise  That they both know he did them  Like the trainer doesn't know  He's being taped  And he has to say something  It's all  It's like the trainer's just talking  Like what do you want me to do  Like we both know  Yeah  Like that to me  It makes Clemens actually look bad  Because  It's almost like  Why would the trainer go  Look I thought I was doing  The right thing  Why would the trainer say that  If he had purposely lied  About Clemens  Like who would say to the guy  In private conversation  Hey I thought I was doing  The right thing  About lying about you  Yeah  Right  That makes sense  That's what I'm saying 
[02:08:30]  That's weird  Yeah I get what you're saying  But  Anybody that comes out  And tries to defend themselves  Always looks better  Than somebody who just sits back  And doesn't do anything  You know  Well there's no traces of steroids  As far as in the system  So you can't  Yeah  Yeah  So he can now just say  Hey I didn't  And then Clemens  What he's talking about  And Clemens had this to say  I'm going to Congress  And I'm going to tell the truth  I'm going to tell everything  That I know  About the situations  And steroids 
[02:09:00]  And anything else  That I have knowledge about  Which isn't a lot  I don't need the Hall of Fame  To justify that  I put my butt on the line  And I work my tail off  And I defy anybody  To say I did it by cheating  Or taking any shortcuts  Hmm  That's pretty adamant  Right there  It is  But it's still  He may not think  That what he took  The growth hormone  Is cheating  Or a shortcut  Right  Might be a technicality  There he's thinking  Yeah possible  I don't know if he did it or not  I kind of hope he didn't 
[02:09:30]  Because I like Clemens  Yeah  I think he did  I think they all did  Not all  But a majority of these guys  Bob Apodaca never did  That's right  Neither did Rusty Staub  He took Propecia  For his red hair  It'll all come out  When their brains  Look like melted  Cherry Garcia ice cream  Really fast 
[02:10:00]  Tim ran in  With another slogan  He's  You know  We're doing this  On a slogan contest  We're thinking  We might need  A new slogan  For the show  And we gave  Tim some laser sound effects  We gave the listeners  Laser sound effects  I think the laser sound effects  Will be up on a website  So they can take that  And put it into their audio  As they come up with  Their own slogans  Right  We're going to do that  As a show somewhere  Okay  And Tim came up with this  Pew pew pew  Pew pew  It's the Opie and Anthony show  Pew pew pew  Pew pew pew  Pew pew pew  Pew pew pew  Pew pew pew pew  Pew pew pew pew pew pew 
[02:10:30]  I'm woo  swimming  All right  Not one  What about the bunch  Not one blank  I don't know  I guess you gotta  Figure that part out  Hmm  It's very mysterious  Yeah  Hey and  Real fast  Thank you for  This reminder too  There's a brand new  OA animation  Up on iTunes  We got a little deal  With iTunes  and it's free. We're not trying to  get you guys to buy anything or any of that 
[02:11:00]  crap. No. You go to iTunes in the  podcast section, they're featuring O&A  shorts that CokeLogic  has done so beautifully.  And the latest one up is  a bit I loved  when Anthony did it. Italian storm  chasers when, what, a tornado touched  down in Brooklyn?  Oh, wow. Which is just  completely insane that a tornado  would touch down in Brooklyn.  So we did a bit  mostly Anthony, Italian  storm chasers and it's now animated. 
[02:11:30]  Five, the finger of Sinatra.  Yeah, yeah.  I wish I remembered this stuff. And you go to  iTunes, their website, you go to  the podcast section and look up O&A shorts.  The finger of Sinatra.  And it's  a free download so  just check it out. We're proud of that and it's pretty cool  to maybe  turn out to other people and all that. It's a nice  little marketing thing for the show.  Okay? Yeah. And Richard's  going to be at Pennywise, you said?  Penguins, Davenport, Iowa.  Penguins. 
[02:12:00]  Penguins.  Dollar foolish.  People forming at my...  And once again,  the site for the  presidential quiz is  WQAD.com, I believe.  If I was wrong,  the right website  will be up on  ONAradio.com later today.  And we promote that tomorrow on the show  we have Isabel Sanford.  Are you kidding?  Wow.  I would never joke about that.  Right on.  Alright, we gotta get out of here.  Thanks, Rich. 
[02:12:30]  Thanks, Tuscher and Rich  from Boston as well.  Congratulations on that big coup.  It's gonna be a big day for those guys.  Lots of  attention for them.  We're going over to XM.  Not joining us. Have a great day.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony.

[02:18:30]  Right.  It's like, yeah, but you can just kind of watch it on TV.  Yeah.  It's like, no, now you can watch it on your computer.  And now the TV is picking up things that are on the computer.  and what was on TV this morning  they said that there's going to be new TVs  offered that gets YouTube  I was a little confused by that  like a YouTube channel  that's going to be available  but how is that going to be possible  are you going to be able to interact with that  channel  I would gather through your remote  or are they just going to show videos 
[02:19:00]  over and over again  like the old MTV  remember the old MTV where they would just play  videos and that was it  and it was the same order  and you know when they were starting over  because don't fear the reaper started up again  or whatever it was  or we're running with the shadows of the night  what were some of the first videos again  I know video kill the radio star  Mexican radio  and whip it  whip it good  but maybe they'll do it in that fashion 
[02:19:30]  where they just kind of get the best of the day  or the week  and play them over and over  and TMZ making a TV  is setting a trend  you're going to see a bunch of really popular websites  have their own TV shows now  and they're all over the Britney Spears story  everybody's all over the Britney Spears story  and I want to play this for Harvey  because there's a difference between his gossip show  and all the others out there  celebrity gossip shows  The Insider with Pat O'Brien  who's just a naughty naughty boy 
[02:20:00]  he's a dirty boy  everyone is reporting about Britney Spears  because  why?  because they care about her?  no  yes  it brings in the money  it brings in the ratings  and I hope most people realize that  but The Insider  there's some kind of guilt associated with what they're doing  by exploiting Britney  and how awful she's become in the last year or so  so at the end of their show yesterday  they did this  it's quick  it's like 30 seconds  and I openly started laughing at the TV last night 
[02:20:30]  like you're so full of shit  and that's why I like TMZ  because they don't do this type of thing  they know what they are  they're going to exploit celebrities  they're going to follow them in and out of restaurants  they are going to show you a video of them  the celebrities being chased by the paparazzi  and they're not going to make any excuses  and they're not going to apologize  because they know that's what the people are tuning in for  they know that people want to see it  they know it brings in the ratings and the money  and they're okay with that  The Insider playing the same game 
[02:21:00]  bunch of pussies  this is what they do at the end  well it seems like most everybody is talking about Britney Spears these days  but the conversation has turned from bad jokes  to genuine concern for the pop star who once owned the record charts  sadly now all she owns are the covers of tabloids  and bizarre late night trips  it is a public free fall that is becoming painful to watch  we are obligated you should know  to cover all the Britney madness  but right now folks it's no fun  and the only headline we would like to see now  is Britney gets help 
[02:21:30]  that's it for us but don't go anywhere  entertainment tonight gets started  right now  they had to do a disclaimer  it's like a disclaimer  they're obligated  why are you obligated  we're obligated  if you feel a little guilty reporting on Britney  then don't you know  then don't report on Britney  we're obligated  me, Britney, Betty  you don't think Pat O'Brien's going  oh, Betsy, whatever  one hour with that nymph  that whore's name was  love to do a few purple monsters with that nymph 
[02:22:00]  hey, if you want to get drunk  and then have sex with a guy who talks like a black guy  just wink and go  alright y'all  when I walk by  your cock, my cock, Jaden, Shondon  whatever those fucking awful fucking white trash names are  hey, by the way  more Duncan Hunter news coming in  Duncan Hunter, my candidate  trying to learn about Duncan Hunter today  Randy, from New Orleans  according to Duncan Hunter's website  oh, why are we on his website? 
[02:22:30]  Randy writes  General Chuck Yeager  the NRA  and gun owners of America  support Duncan Hunter  if Chuck Yeager says he's okay  then I say he's okay  who's better  who's a bigger American hero than Chuck Yeager  and then it says  Randy writes  what a surprise that Anthony does too  so yeah, I mean  it's very accurate  this website  I gotta say  although I'm not happy that  they said I should vote for Hillary 37%  and then Obama 36% 
[02:23:00]  yeah  and Jimmy was  Jimmy was very similar  he had Hillary and Obama tied at 44%  but that shows you how inaccurate those things are in a weird way  because it's almost like  I'm not  I'm probably much closer to McCain's view of the country  than I am to Hillary's  but because of a couple of key issues  there's a gay marriage  and a few things like that  some people actually will not vote for somebody  that they are  that they should vote for  based on most of their politics  because of one issue  yeah, you're right  like there have been candidates 
[02:23:30]  I'm sure that  people have loved  every issue is like  oh my god  this guy's right on the money  but  he doesn't like abortion  so I can't vote for him  yeah  it's like why are you throwing it out  all for that  like it doesn't make sense to me  thank you  just looking at Jimmy  I agree  thank you  so what do you think of the insider  I know we're doing two things  uh that  that's  it's stupid  it's such a crock of shit right  it's phony  it's phony 
[02:24:00]  phony  I thought we had one minute before  Harvey  Harvey  what  uh huh  Harvey  Harvey  we're uh  we're just about ready  to talk  to Harvey Love  that's good  from TMZ  what's the big stories  they're working on over there  well it's all about Britney  Britney around the clock  is it around the clock  and the other thing  about the insider  I don't really give a shit  about Britney  to tell you the truth  I can't be honest with you  you don't care  I don't  is that all you think about 
[02:24:30]  24 hours a day  I will be disappointed  if uh  and this is how I truly feel  not trying to be  play the role of a shock jock  or anything  this is how my twisted  fucking mind works  I will be truly disappointed  if this doesn't end  in some horrific tragedy  for Britney Spears  well it could  I'm not one of these people  going oh I hope she gets help  and all that  I find this so fascinating  to  to see it  like a celebrity  that had everything  just fucking it up  so bad  yeah  I'm not gonna 
[02:25:00]  I'll be like  oh this sucks  what a boring ending  if she goes into rehab  and gets the help  that she obviously needs  it's all better  I wanna hear something like  wow they found her body here  or  I'm serious  I don't know why  they painted her  as a real  goody two shoes  is what it was  so it's one extreme  to the other  let's go right to  a very very busy man  Harvey  hey guys  Harvey Levin  you're talking  to Opie Anthony  and Jim Norton  and I'll say it  I'm a huge fan 
[02:25:30]  of what you're doing  well thank you  I appreciate it  huge fan of TMZ.com  it's the only place  I go for celebrity gossip  and then I'm like  alright I'll give this  TV show a try  I DVR it every night  and watch every single episode  do you really  yeah I love  I just love  the presentation  of the whole thing  and I've been  I've been preaching TMZ  for a while  and I'll tell you why  it's really simple  you guys don't  try to be something  you're not  you know that people  want to see  celebrities looking awful 
[02:26:00]  you know that  people want to see  celebrities  walking in and out  of restaurants  maybe drunk  you want to  we want to see  the paparazzi  chasing the celebrities  with their video cameras  and them getting punched  and you guys don't try  to hide behind  some false  false shit  like the Insider  in Entertainment Tonight  where they actually  try to show concern  and stuff like that  you  okay okay  now this will prove  that I cannot  take a compliment  I'm going to 
[02:26:30]  slightly disagree  with you here  wow really  I am  I am  look  that's not  our mission  is not to make  celebrities look bad  it's to make them real  and some  real okay  and but that's  honest to god  the truth  because my feeling  about this  from the beginning  I mean the reason  I was interested  in even doing this  right  is because when you  look at like red carpets  and junkets  they're plastic people  they're not real people  so you end up seeing  you know these stars  with perfect hair  and perfect dresses  with perfect marriages 
[02:27:00]  and perfect skin  and they say exactly  what the publicists  want them to say  and it's phony  and I always thought  you know what  these people have to be  more interesting  than they look  on all of these shows  and I thought  you know  they go places  they go to restaurants  they go to dry cleaners  they do different things  and if you show them  in their element  because you know  a lot of these things  we show people  who are good moms  and we show people  who are you know  really good tippers  and we show people  who are really bad  but it's all real  and that's the premise 
[02:27:30]  of everything we're doing  is you know  enough of the BS  I mean we're just doing  real people  and it's good  it's bad  it's ugly  it's pretty  it's everything  yeah your explanation  is much better than mine  yes it should be described  more as a real situation  well the insider  they kind of gloss it over  and try to keep them  on a pedestal  and if they fall  it's like you know  I'll give you an example  I mean I'll give you an example  we did some stories  over the weekend  and we were extremely critical 
[02:28:00]  of Dr. Phil  right  and you know  a lot of people called me  and said  oh my god  you can't do that  he's really powerful  you can't take him on  and all the other shows  suck up  but you know what  and I like Dr. Phil personally  he's a prick  but look  I think  I just think this was wrong  I mean I think it's wrong  that he went up to the room  without her knowing it  I think it's wrong  that the hospital  let him go up to that room  I think it was wrong  for him to issue a press release  about how he felt  about her condition 
[02:28:30]  and I think it was wrong  to do a TV intervention  because this woman  is in danger of dying  I mean she could literally die  and she needs to be committed  to a mental hospital  and I know  I know that sounds extreme  but that's what people  are trying to do right now  they're trying to get her  to voluntarily commit herself  to a mental hospital  because she has a really severe  bipolar disorder  so we ended up doing  a bunch of stories  over the weekend  basically calling him out on it  and he ended up  cancelling that show  and you know  and then I watched  some of the other shows 
[02:29:00]  last night  and I thought  is this the same story?  I mean  you know  because it was just  so sycophantic  you know  when I watched  some of the other shows  the way they handle this thing  it wasn't real  it just was not  what really went down  Harvey  I think the thing  on everybody's mind  I mean  you obviously  were on the people's court  which is how a lot of us  came to know you  but truthfully  this is what  a lot of the main topic  I know  a show I love  by the way  of course you did  a comedy  I know  a very sensitive issue 
[02:29:30]  what happened  to Doug Llewellyn  for many years  I have wanted to know  what happened  to Doug Llewellyn  he's embalmed  on Trigger  right now  he's what  he's dead  did he die  I don't know  that was funny  if you guys knew  no I'm  oh I thought he died  no  it was a joke dude  I've seen this stuff  to Trigger  exactly  yeah  okay you get my joke  it's great  you know what  can I tell you something  Doug is a great guy  he's in North Carolina  he's a really really nice guy  yeah  and his hair  is exactly the same 
[02:30:00]  now Harvey  what puts you guys  on the map  TMZ  was it one particular thing  one particular video  you guys got your hands on  um  it wasn't  I mean look  I guess the biggest story  we've done  in some ways  is Mel Gibson  right  but when you  you know  over time  I mean the first day  we launched  we got that  you know  Paris Hilton  when she crashed  when her boyfriend  crashed the car  and then  fled from the scene  and then she blew a kiss  to the cops  and the cops let her go 
[02:30:30]  that ended up being  the first day  we were up  and it crashed  our site  about 40 times  and then  you know  we just got a bunch of stuff  but you remember  the Brandon Davis  fire crotch video  with Lindsay Lohan  sure  I mean  that ended up being  a huge video for us  because  you know  nobody  and when we put it up  I got calls  corporately  from people saying  why would you put this up  I mean  there's no news value  in this  and I thought  hello  this incredibly rich  bastard  is like  on this rant 
[02:31:00]  showing everything  that's wrong  about young Hollywood  and I thought  this is just gold  and I think  just over time  people realized  okay  they're accurate  which I think  is really important  and it's fun  I mean  it's just  you know  it's real  and I mean  I keep getting back  to that word  but that's  I mean  look  and I'm not saying  we're perfect  and we made a lot  of mistakes  in terms of  trying to figure out  how to do it  I knew nothing  about the internet  and I was trying  to put television  on the internet  at the beginning  and it was terrible  but you know  over time  I think it's just  it's an entertaining site 
[02:31:30]  one of my favorites  was the Alec Baldwin  voicemail  you know  I have to tell you something  of all the stories  we did  that one  is one  that  I was really  conflicted about  and I still  am uneasy about  I'm going to be  really honest with you  I mean  I  I struggled with that  for a couple of days  before finally deciding  to put it up  on the site  because  on the one hand  it was a story  about a tape 
[02:32:00]  that was actually  submitted into court  as evidence  and it was the key  piece of evidence  that the judge  used to basically say  you can't contact  your daughter  for a while  so on a level  it was newsworthy  I mean no doubt  it was newsworthy  it was part of a court case  it was legally obtained  the whole thing  on the other hand  you know  how many fathers  have done things  that they're not happy  about  with their kids  you know  where they've  Joel Steinberg  there's a few 
[02:32:30]  you asked  I mean  from one lawyer  to another  we could go  to our go-to list  if you like  hey Harvey  I don't know  I mean  that one  you know  I think ultimately  we made the right decision  but you know  you struggle  with a lot of this stuff  Harvey the book  about Tom Cruise  that is out right now  this Andrew Morton  obviously  Scientologists  sue for everything  are they going to win  or is he telling the truth  you know  from what you know  Tom Cruise 
[02:33:00]  to me is a mystery  I mean  I've gone back and forth  with this guy  trying to figure him out  I really can't  I mean  he is probably  he's the person  I understand  least in Hollywood  I really mean that  and you know  he's just tough  to figure out  Scientology  I'll tell you something  I've been in LA  for years and years and years  and I was a local reporter  for a long time  and I covered police corruption  and I've had death threats  and all sorts of things  the one thing  that I'm scared of dealing with  is Scientology  yeah everybody is 
[02:33:30]  they're such a pain in the ass  I mean  they are just crazy  you know  just in terms of  you know  they're just  just the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the commitment  they make  just to making  everybody's life miserable  is so difficult  that everybody  just avoids them  isn't it weird  they're like a religion  right  they're like a bona fide religion  now  they've been declared a religion  I think  correct  well yeah  I mean  they say they're a religion  but  and yeah  they may be a religion  but  they're just impossible  to deal with 
[02:34:00]  yeah you  I hear if you  really start criticizing  them and you have any voice  the lawyers get  right on your ass  I mean  they're like  the lawyers are the  least of the problems  I mean  they just  make your life miserable  yeah it's really  a good group of people  amazing  Harvey  how do you guys  get all your footage  do you guys got  guys just working for you  or is it more of a  more of a situation  where these guys  get the good video  and freelance it  or pull it all  it's a combo  I mean we have  we have a bunch of cameramen  and most of them 
[02:34:30]  are in LA and New York  and most actually in LA  but we have  you know  we buy video  from the outside  and that's the other thing  that's so phony  it's like when you hear  some of these other shows  say we don't buy video  right  phony  everybody buys video  and you know  there's nothing wrong  with it either  I mean if somebody  shoots something  and you buy it  what it's less valid  because you bought it  you're paying cameramen  anyway  so there's nothing  wrong with it  and we yeah  we buy video  and I'm guessing  probably the way  it breaks down  is 75% of the stuff 
[02:35:00]  we shoot  and 25  maybe 20%  of the stuff  we buy  sure  and there was something  we were discussing  the last couple of days  isn't it true  that the celebrities  or a lot of these celebrities  they love the attention  to the point  where they kind of  work together  with the paparazzi  okay  so  like for example  Britney Spears  okay  where she has people  behind the scenes  and they let the paparazzi  know look  you know  at noon today  she's going to be  at that Starbucks  you might want to get a shot  does that type of thing 
[02:35:30]  go on or does it not  okay  here's the deal  how many restaurants  do you guess are in LA  oh we've been out there  a million times  sure  hundreds  thousands  ten thousand  I don't know  yeah  so there are three restaurants  in LA  where  the paparazzi  really hang out  Mr. Chow  the Ivy  and Il Soleil  right  why is it that  Lindsay Lohan  goes to all three  of those restaurants  there you go  of course  I mean  and then they  oh go ahead  sorry  I'm sorry 
[02:36:00]  I can go further  when she was in rehab  she was alerting  the paparazzi  to get the candid shots  of her  I can tell you that  I know  Britney  has this deal  with one of the agencies  here  where they're  up her you know what  all the time  I mean  they are everywhere  in fact she's  stripping one of these guys  apparently  yeah  wow  not with that agency  but with another  I mean  she totally  she is completely  codependent on the paparazzi  because I see these  celebrities  they leave the Ivy  let's say 
[02:36:30]  and obviously  they want the attention  so they're there  and then they leave  and then they play  this part like  oh leave me alone  oh let me get to my car  we put this video up  about I don't know  a couple weeks ago  of Tori Spelling  and it's the most  hilarious thing  you've ever seen  she's walking  from the Ivy  to Kitson  which is like  a block away  and Kitson's  the other store  that everybody  that all the paparazzi  hang out at  and she's  just stunned  that oh  you guys  please get out of my way  I can't walk  and it's like  in your wildest dreams  honey  you haven't been 
[02:37:00]  on a show  in 10 years  and you're acting  so indignant  it's hilarious  it's unbelievable  how much  does a good  Britney video  go for?  don't want to go there?  you know  it really depends  I mean  if everybody  shoots it  it doesn't nearly  have the value  as if it's  exclusive  and only one person  has it  and if it's really good  I mean  it's like anything else  you have to judge  how many people  have it  and then you  have to look  at how good  it is  and those  are the two 
[02:37:30]  factors  and it can  vary wildly  like wildly  is there anything  that you've gotten  that they wanted  you to show  or they wanted  you to do  but you said  no?  every day  what's something  that you didn't  want to show?  what was something  you did not  want to show  for whatever reason?  okay I'll tell you  I mean  we have a  we have a bunch  of standards  on this website  and I mean  this because  I mean  to me  this is the only  way of doing business  that you don't  put stuff up  that's ill gotten  you don't chase  people  you don't invade  people's privacy  you don't break  the law  and we have  this thing  that we call  the yuck factor 
[02:38:00]  if it just  doesn't feel right  but I had somebody  come by my office  once  with documents  and you guys  can't push me  on this  if I tell you  you promise?  yeah  oh yeah  all right  we promise  no no  we promise  we promise  I had  this guy  plays the same  game  with documents  involving the  Michael Jackson  case  what was he  accused of?  it wasn't  it wasn't the  case  it was  a whole thing  around him  and Debbie  Rowe 
[02:38:30]  and the kids  I'm telling you  they're the most  shocking documents  I think I've  ever seen  it's unbelievable  how crazy his  life is  and what he  put in writing  and how certain  things were done  and it was amazing  and it would have  been I think  the biggest story  we ever would have  published had we  done it  now why didn't you?  because I talked  to this woman  and I realized  she stole it  from a law office  and she worked  in a law office  and she stole  these documents  and I kicked 
[02:39:00]  I threw her  out of my office  do you have  her phone number?  we don't mind  ill-gotten goods  or the ick factor  as you called it  I'm sorry  we're all about  the ick factor  we don't care  if it's topless  Dakota fanning pictures  how much did you  want for them?  we didn't get that far  oh wow  okay  as soon as I realized  what happened  I threw out of my office  and I'm telling you 
[02:39:30]  they were amazing  were there photos?  no  okay  they were contracts  all right  he's not good  I'm telling you  see you told me  you wouldn't  now  okay now here's the deal  have you watched  the TV show?  absolutely  okay so all my people  are sitting in this room  and they're waiting  for me to start  the meeting  well I love the presentation  you sit at the  you know in the front  of like an office  everyone's in their  cubicles and they  start firing out  what they got at you  yeah  it's a lot of fun  and really fast  drunken chicks  more of that 
[02:40:00]  he just had  love drunk chicks  and they're not  even famous people  they're just drunk  just drunk chicks  drunk chicks  you guys think  we're so sleazy  I can't believe it  no it's really  the stuff that we like  we're sleazy  and Harvey  before we let you go  what are you guys  working on as far as  Britney goes  what's the new angles  coming out?  well I mean  I'm telling you  they are trying to get her  in a mental hospital  right now  I mean people are  desperately trying to  get her in a mental  hospital  and this guy that  she's hanging out with  this photographer  do you know about this?  yeah of course  yes  I mean 
[02:40:30]  there's a whole  story behind this guy  and what he's trying  to do  and it's  she just doesn't  have real good  judgment right now  I can't believe  she's attainable  right now  like she's not  in the best shape  she was  I talked to some  people yesterday  I could get her  I've talked to some  people yesterday  who've been talking  to her  she's really lucid  right now  I mean  you would think  she's like  incoherent  and can't follow  the thought  she's really lucid  on a level  I mean her judgment  is really off  but when you talk 
[02:41:00]  to her just  on a level  she seems to  follow what  everybody's saying  and she can have  a conversation  where you think  oh okay  she's pulled it  together  but she hasn't  right  how does it end?  I hope not  what you're suggesting  because you know  what she's in really  seriously she's in  danger  right  okay  and her little  sister following  her footsteps  and her mom  was going to go  on you know  Dr. Phil  and he was going  to talk about  what great  concerned parents  yes they are  let me tell you  something about  let me tell you  something about  Jamie Lynn  when she was 
[02:41:30]  shooting  Zoe 101  that show  you know  this guy  that got her  pregnant  yeah  they were  basically sleeping  together  guess where  in mommy's house  yes  oh man  that's pretty obvious  I rest my case  and Harvey  before we let you go  by the way  before we let you go  I know  but I'm really  a huge fan  I love that  you're putting  live video  now on TMZ  where all of a sudden  you'll be outside  the courthouse  or something  waiting for a press  conference  you hear everyone 
[02:42:00]  just babbling  and you can just  check it out  and then you got  people just on the  street walking up  to a camera  that's live on TMZ  talking about  we did that for the  first time yesterday  with Brittany  and we had like  you know we went  to Hollywood Boulevard  so we have like  you know some  respectable looking  tourists come up  to talk about  Dr. Phil  and then Elvis  comes up  right  yeah  and these people  just come up  to the cameras  on TMZ  they don't have to  edit it  they just let it run  and you get to  you know  hear people  on the street  just talking  about the Brittany  situation  so Harvey  you're a big  you're a big

[02:45:00]  for uh  touch or wrist  um  that's a biggie  for the boys up in  Boston  I see them being  fired for this  really  I better not  I see them being  fired for this  yeah cause when  when you get too  much attention  too much attention  people freak  the fuck out  you know what's  gonna happen  here's what's  gonna happen  they're gonna  they're gonna  start saying  they're sexist  this is a horrible  thing  if this was  uh  an issue with  blacks  or  Asians  or this  but women  can get  kicked around  we need them  off the air  blah blah blah  blah blah  you know 
[02:45:30]  I think I might  have to agree  with you  once again  I always  opt for  firing  is it fired  or so fired  though  not so fired  right now  just fired  possibly just  fired  so far  they're not  mentioned  in this article  yeah but you  know what  so let's keep  talking about it  I was very  suspicious  oh Hannity has  it now too  what do you mean  on his website  he has the audio  from it  is that what he  had that was  so big  no  no no no  supposedly Hannity 
[02:46:00]  has a bombshell  that uh  can I say  on who  I don't know  maybe you're not  I think you did  earlier  you did already  did I really  yeah  no I don't think  we were on the air  or were we  oh we weren't  I don't know  Hannity's a good  friend of the show  but he said he  would let us in  on it when he's  ready to reveal  his bombshell  so maybe I should  just keep it at  that for now  okay  we want  we want to have  some friends  in this business  uh getting back  to touching  rich  oh brain freeze  I was very  you alright  yeah  I was very  suspicious  when I got 
[02:46:30]  the communique  from rich  last night  going wow  why are they  pushing this  toward us  right now  and I bet  you because  we've been  in their  situation  where all  sudden  you got  fucking  gold  yeah  like the  stars aligned  in radio  you got gold  you had this  idea you're  gonna go up  there and  disrupt  hillary  with this  you know  iron my  shirt thing  and it  works out  perfectly  and then the  next day  you're excited  to just blow  it out of the  water on your  show  and all  of a sudden  the fucking  fucking pd 
[02:47:00]  or or somebody  at the station  you know  lays the hammer  down because  they're paranoid  don't talk  about it  we do not  want you  talking about  it  don't talk  about it  I wonder if  he snuck  the email  to me  because he  was like  I gotta get  the attention  out there  I don't know  I'm just  it's a hunch  I got  devil's advocate  for toucher  and rich  maybe uh  these guys  just did it  to impress  them uh  and toucher  and rich  didn't know  they were gonna  do it  I mean  it's very  possible  that they  did it  just hey  let's do  something  to  hey 
[02:47:30]  yeah  sure  I think  it's hilarious  it's uh  there's nothing  if they  fire them  over this  fucking terrestrial  radio  is finished  yeah  really  it's just silly  it's very early  into this  they're not gonna  fire them  it's fine  I know nothing  I'm always wrong  it made  it's on CNN  though I guess  so  or Fox  Fox News  nothing better  to talk about  that's true  some guy held up  a funny sign  at a rally  it's newsworthy 
[02:48:00]  let me hold my  smoothie with both hands  because for some  reason in radio  you gotta have  responsibility  for what  for what  why I don't know  yeah  sexism not dead  it's not  what taught you  that on Fox News  the fact that  certain people  don't want women  to have abortions  ah dude  they're fired  oh shit  someone making  points motherfuckers  they're gonna be fired  you think fired  because people can't  handle the pressure  on radio  I know  they lost it  when we did our 
[02:48:30]  Tom Brady joke  up there  I think we talked  about that a little bit  yeah they got all upset  yeah they gave me  a talking to  well I was like  come on we're just  fucking around man  having a little fun  I think because  they have a very  close relationship  with the Crafts  since they're  play by play station  so they probably  heard a little bit  of this crap  Jonathan actually  was really cool  we know  sorry to interrupt  Jonathan Craft  we go way back  with him from our  AAF days  and he was a fan  of our show  and he was  he was  he was okay  with the whole thing  what happened  just  the number  I don't even  want to say 
[02:49:00]  what the number  19 Google trend is  that's being  Googled  that's the 19th  wow  well you could  say it right  yeah  well maybe you can't  no  well let's just say  Obama  and the first  whoa  wow  and I'm  honestly I'm scared  to say this  so I'm going to say  it this way  19  it's a Google trend  I'll say  Obama's the second word  the first word  is what happened  to President Kennedy  oh wow  wow  it's the 19th  Google trend today  as we look at 
[02:49:30]  the Google trends  why  I'm too scared  to say that  I'll be honest  with you  oh my god  I'll be honest  with you  I'm not saying  that  don't say it  Jimmy  you don't want  a tape  of  but that's  the 19th  where's that  coming from  though  that's  the Google trends  oh like  oh you want me  see what  it's the word  that is used  when you  get rid of  a political  leader  violently  well Kennedy  usually in his death  just say Kennedy  right  vote  Obama  vote  wow  and 
[02:50:00]  I thought  you were just  going to like  say something  with the n-word  is Jimmy Tide  08  number one  oh yeah  Jimmy Tide  08  is number one  hilarious  thank you people  the Google bomb  works again today  Jimmy Tide  08  is the number one  who's Jimmy Tide  do they spell it  with the umlauts  or I'll scream  you can't umlauts  online  Jimmy Tide  this new  this new candidate  coming out of  nowhere  with stark 
[02:50:30]  shirts  people are saying  that they  well they said  they wanted to  defend you  because they said  how E-Rock  said it  they also thought  the candidate  was Jimmy Tide  can we  is right  well we can  hear that again  because E-Rock  is  an idiot  he's  frighteningly stupid  yeah  and iron shirt  is iron my shirt  is number nine  on Google Trends  yeah you know  and I didn't think  about it but  yeah  they're getting  a little paranoid  and nervous up there  um  remember the time  that we were  just starting out  just starting to 
[02:51:00]  make our markup  in Boston  I think I've  we've told this  story a couple  times  and um  we got on  Howard Stern's  radar  and we were  nobodies  working in the  middle of nowhere  outside of Boston  in Worcester Mass  doing afternoon  drive  and I'll be honest  with you  when I found out  that Howard was  talking about us  for the first time  we were very  excited  like this is  really good  for us  really good  we're not  scared of the  guy  and if  someone  that is  so much  bigger  radio  talks about  you  that's  really  good  for you  yeah  it's a good  thing  as long as 
[02:51:30]  you can kind  of back it  up  because other  some people  get talked  about and  they're just  they just  get swatted  around like a  like a fly  like the dude  in Cleveland  comes to mind  that dude  Maxwell  real name  Benjamin  Bornstein  that  really  I don't even  know these  guys names  Benjamin  there's a  there's been  a bunch  of them  and they get  their day  but they don't  have anything  to back it  up and they  just go  away  so Howard  starts talking  about us  I forgot what  we did  that we got  on his radar  for the first  time  it wasn't  and it wasn't  the first  right  I mean there  was many  other times  he talked  about us  and we 
[02:52:00]  were excited  and I  remember us  talking going  oh my god  this is really  good you know  and he was  being heard  on BCN  at the time  so the  Boston audience  was hearing  and most  people are  curious so if  Howard's talking  about this  stupid show  called Opie and  Anthony  a lot of people  would go  wait they  broadcast here  in Boston  I'm gonna  check them  out  and then that's  where you  have to back  it up  and hopefully  you're entertaining  and funny enough  where some of  these people  out of curiosity  are gonna  all of a sudden  become fans  it's just how it  works  so we got  excited  and Dave  Dickless 
[02:52:30]  I fucking  hate this guy  and it's been  so many years  that we've even  seen this stupid  idiot  he comes up  to him  and has a  meeting behind  closed doors  he goes  as you're aware  Howard's talking  about you  no it was at  a buffet  it was at  that dumb  Chinese buffet  in Westboro  he goes  as you're aware  Howard's talking  about you guys  and we're like  I go  I remember  like it was  yesterday  yeah this is  really good  huh Dave  like you know  you're with us  right  this is great  this is exactly  what you want  he goes  no no  this is not  you don't want 
[02:53:00]  Howard talking  about you  I don't want  you guys  mentioning the fact  that Howard's  talking about you  he was so  fucking  in a panic  what a faggot  that guy  was  he really  was  I never  met him  and I hate  him  yeah  and we  you know  our career  exploded  and he never  never really  did anything  with his career  to the point  I don't even  think he's  doing radio  anymore  last I heard  he was like  good for radio  he was programming  a business radio  station  that has  basically a  stock ticker  that's what  a stock ticker 
[02:53:30]  on a radio  basically like  this Bloomberg  radio where  like they mostly  talk about stocks  going up and down  and what this  stock is at  and this analysis  saying blah blah blah  real boring shit  unless you're  you know  unless you're  you got a portfolio  which is not  everybody obviously  yeah unless you're  day trading  and that was his  last gig that I  heard of  that he was a  program director  the program director  of a business  radio station  I'd like to hear  that though  I mean you want  to know what's  up what's down  I mean what's  I disinvested 
[02:54:00]  money by the way  I'm doing it now  oh  I want to  diversify  I didn't want  a diversified  portfolio  do you  you have CDs  right CDs  are good  I like  DVDs better  how about  US bonds  I like  MP3s better  Gary US  bonds  but you are  safe  CDs and bonds  huh  stocks are good  mutual funds  what are mutual  funds  I think I'm  doing them  too  that's a lot 
[02:54:30]  of different  stocks put  into one little  bunch there  so that  so the market  goes up and  down  it keeps it  pretty stable  so you don't  drive yourself  nuts watching  every day  here's what I  did  I told them  I wanted to  put $10,000  into a mutual  fund  that has at  least a 38%  yield  38%  so I says  if my yield  is going to be  any less  than 38% 
[02:55:00]  you take my  money  and you  invest it  in books  what about  scholastics  I'm invested  in scholastics  I'm investing  in school books  3D school books  it's a new thing  where the kids  open them up  and little  hologram  mathematics  pop out of them  that's my new  future  that's a great  idea  that's right  money maker  someone's suggesting 
[02:55:30]  you should invest  in  hey we got the  clip  Jimmy Tide  from earlier  so in case  you're just  listening for the  first time  you should listen  to the replay  it was a good  one today  but basically  there's this  website  WQAD  WQAD.com  there's a poll  you can take  you answer a  bunch of questions  about 10 or  12 questions  and then  according to  the answers 
[02:56:00]  you give  to the questions  they'll tell you  what candidate  you should possibly  vote for  and we all  took the  poll  and then  EROC had to  announce  the candidate  that Jim Norton  should be  voting for  according to his  answers  and this is  how it went  down  alright now  we go to  EROC who  was keeping  track of  Jimmy's answers  Jim Norton  according to  his website  should be  voting for who  Jimmy Tide  for first place  absolutely  man keeps  clean shirts 
[02:56:30]  you're  absolutely  right  he said it  like that was  the guy's name  yeah  it was almost  like saying  Barack Obama  for first place  he went  Jimmy Tide  for first place  for first place  Jimmy Tide  yeah  and since my  candidate  no one heard  of him  you know  it could have  possibly  it certainly  could have  been  Jimmy Tide  and a lot  of people  as the feedback  admitted that  you know  they were 
[02:57:00]  also tricked  and thought  that there  was a guy  named Jimmy Tide  out there  he an idiot  new rule  on the Opie  and Anthony  show  I think  this will  prevent  that  can we  have  Eric  come in  sure  is it  okay  why would  you want  to see  believe me  I wouldn't  we've been  having fun  today  come on  dummy  that fucking  suede  shoe brush  head  he has  that's what  his fucking  head is good  for  to remove  lint  from my  suede  shoes  that Jimmy  Tide clip  did you hear  it again  from now on 
[02:57:30]  I think that  on this show  to prevent  that from  happening  you should  refer to me  only as  Mr. Norton  Mr. Norton  I like that  okay  we'll do  Mr. Norton  get out  god that's  felt good  look at the  power you  yield  I can't get  over his  hair  every time  he walks  in I just  I just try  to figure out  his hair  it's horrendous  like  E-Rock  already knows  how he's  going to  look with  a toupee  when he  actually  loses his  hair  because he  has a  real life 
[02:58:00]  toupee  when his  fucking  hair is  gray  if he  keeps that  style  he'll be  trying to  kiss  Kevin Spacey  in a  garage  hey by the  way  why did  E-Rock  leave so  fast  we got  an E-Rock  confession  he confessed  something to  Than and  Travis  do you  remember  E-Rock  E-Rock  confessions  well you better  get back in  here  yes we know  Jimmy Tide  08 is  officially the 
[02:58:30]  number one  google trend  thank you to  everybody that  helped us out  on that today  oh we gotta  get to the  Bob Kelly  thing we still  have lots  of show  today  E-Rock  would you  confess  something  you confess  something to  Than and  Travis  do you know  what that  is  Travis  comment  comment  answer  comment  E-Rock  comment  I don't  recall  I don't  recall  yes  do you  remember  taking the  stairs  yesterday  yes 
[02:59:00]  no  I didn't  take the  stairs  yes  no  I was  going to  I was  going to  when they  told me I  should take  the elevator  so I went  with them  Travis suggested  that you might  be going into  the stairs  just to  master  you remember  no I'm  not ashamed  of it  oh that's  even worse  so what  happened  I'm confused  now  so  Than and I  were leaving  and we were  walking to the  elevator  and there's  stairs  right outside  the XM 
[02:59:30]  studios  which only  go down  to the  third  floor  so Eric  is going  down those  stairs  and I say  Eric  you should  be taking  the elevator  and Eric  said  well it  goes down  to the  first floor  but you  gotta cross  the entire  third floor  to get to  the second  set of  stairs  so when  you get  down to  the third  floor  there's  usually  this big  conference room  and they're  always doing  something with  architecture  they always  have these  party platters  laid out  so 
[03:00:00]  you go  down there  they have  like  cookies  and fruit  and stuff  so you  just grab  some stuff  as I'm  walking out  of the  building  you  pilfer  food  from the  third  floor  on the  buffet  table  cookies  and fruit  like we  don't know  what option  you take  cookies  and one  grape  doesn't mean  cookies  and fruit  some kind  of yogurt  dip  you want  to dip  your brownie  in that  no I don't  eat chocolate  you don't 
[03:00:30]  eat chocolate  what's wrong  what kind  of cookies  do you like  are you  communist  you take  it up  the ass  and yell  thanks  why no  chocolate  I never  did  chocolate  caramel  coffee  I love  caramel  none of  that stuff  you got that  soft body  from not  eating chocolate  never  that's amazing  soft body  what do you eat  fluff another  no I don't  like that either  what do you  eat cotton candy  what do you  eat  regular food  I'm not a  big like  sweet eater  no 
[03:01:00]  oh just a lot  of pasta  not even that  it's just a lot  of  stop saying  everything I named  he's never heard  a salad  you eat a lot  of salad  I eat a lot  of crap  but it's not  like pizza  yeah pizza's good  all right  hamburgers  steaks  things like that  steak fish  steak fish  steak fattening  is steak fattening  I guess  a lot of it  it is  depends on  occasionally  depends on  the rare treat  for yourself  depends on the cut 
[03:01:30]  I know a little bit  about steak  porterhouse  the most fattening  porterhouse  how about like  a New York strip  you gotta go with  the petite  filet mignon  I don't like  the filet mignon  and you gotta do  the petite  no I don't  want a petite  the filet  wait  filet  filet  filet  filet  filet  filet  filet mignon  filet  not to be  confused  with fucking  Alain Robert  who's that  the one who  does it  without the  burden of equipment  it's all about 
[03:02:00]  the French  with that stuff  they really are  nuts  they love heights  so  so you grab  some food  from the buffet  and you do this  on a regular basis  when they have  the food laid out  every now and then  but there's also  a lot of other people  in this building  who make that trip  down there  they use our  bathrooms  and then they go  down to the third  floor to get the food  you uh  how do you know  so much about the  building  oh I thought you  were gonna say  how much  how do you know  so much about food  and where it's at  he's like a bear  he knows where the  honey is  I try to hang  the food in the  trees  he gets it 
[03:02:30]  you rock  well  but it's not there  all the time  because sometimes  that room's vacant  for like  four to six weeks  and then all of a sudden  there's people in there  again  and it's just  non-stop food  all they hear  is your sobs  so that means  Eric goes down there  every day  to check if there's food  I walk down the stairs  every day  sometimes it's quiet  sometimes it's like  when Nicholson's  in the overlook  and he hears the party  the goose and duck  soiree  soiree  coming from the room  a bit of avocat 
[03:03:00]  all over your  outdated hairdo  Mr. Torrance  oh avocat  oh an alert  woman  taken out  on stretcher  after fainting  at Obama event  that's like the Beatles  oh she's probably  never seen him  she only heard him speak  I was gonna vote  for this guy  alright  I guess that's all  I mean  how many fat jokes  can we possibly do  every fucking day  with the fat jokes 
[03:03:30]  I'm making fat jokes  about him  I was  and the listeners were  in their  in their privacy  of their own homes  cookie stealing  bag of shit  hey  did you guys see  did you see  O'Reilly losing his mind  that video  trying to get  Obama's attention  just losing his mind  because the security people  were kind of holding  O'Reilly back  oh boy  it's on YouTube  it's all about him  you hear O'Reilly  I can't paraphrase  but basically saying  this is bullshit  just losing his mind 
[03:04:00]  and then  what did he want  and then basically  forced himself  in front of Obama  and then Obama  had to make believe  he gave a shit  about Bill O'Reilly  at least he  yeah but how come  security didn't just  fucking club that  big dick Irishman  beat him over the head  do we have  the actual story  because there's  a little more to it  than what I'm  than what I'm saying  alright we'll take a break  we'll try to find that  fainting at Obama  and it's  and that's a Fox News alert  it's amazing  we  after the break  we got  episode 2 
[03:04:30]  of Epstein  and the inventor  Sam and Steve  we got to play  the first one  for everybody  thank goodness  there's a lot of  Epstein and the inventor  fans out there  yeah  got two  Sam and Steve  and then we got  Bob Kelly puking  as he's doing his show  on Saturday  and you might  you might say to yourself  Bob Kelly puking  kind of heard that before  yeah  according to Danny  this is the best puke yet  yeah  I don't know the details  but that's all I know  some woman was talking  about something disgusting  and it got to him 
[03:05:00]  and it got to him  yeah  during his show  well I was talking  about exercise  huh  she said I did some  sit ups  we'll get into that stuff  and some other things  after the break  Opie and Anthony  you want entertainment  wholesome  interesting  entertainment  yeah  shut your face  I'm a pervert  you upcock  just take your hands  and brush them gently  on your nipples  and just like zone out 
[03:05:30]  hope she's screaming  like that later  in an alley  my junk  smells like Wayne Newton  so you're saying  you make love to the dead  dresses make me  want to get fucked up  the butt  it's the Opie and Anthony  show  Opie and Anthony  Jim Norton  getting ready  for a big tour  right Jimmy  there's a baby 
[03:06:00]  in the studio  look at the family  the whole family  is here in the studio  a beautiful baby  by the way  Bonnie  I said it on the air  but I haven't said it  to you personally  I don't think  I'm not sure  the kid loves me  by the way  she can't stop  looking at me  she thinks I'm  the bee's knees  Rich Voss and Bonnie  in the studio  with their kid  the kid's kind of  just looking around  going what the F  she looks at me  I make her happy  it's just natural  she's beautiful  wait I don't know  why I can't hear you 
[03:06:30]  try again  we couldn't hear you  oh no  she's just  I don't know  this is an old hat  to her  this radio thing  you know  her birth  Steve will always be  in the camera's way  oh thanks  she has very pretty  blue eyes  yeah absolutely  are they green  they're blue  they look blue  they're like gray  yeah blue  Steve's always in the  way of the camera  blue eyes  just amazing  like nobody's in my family  like blue eyes  Bonnie what are your eyes  they're brown 
[03:07:00]  but my sister and my dad  have blue eyes  wait but  I have a recessive gene  he must have a recessive gene  somewhere in his family  well you both have brown eyes  so it's kind of rare  to have a blue eyed baby  her eyes still might change  so that should help  your paranoia  that you have  in your soul  it's been a great  great time  great ride so far  with him  if it's his or not  you know  we haven't talked  sit down Bonnie  get Bonnie the nice  comfortable chair  no no  that's not good enough  for you  get her the nice  there you go 
[03:07:30]  like you're watching  like you're watching  football  yeah sit down  we would love to see  a nurse  don't do it  I kind of like  to take a peek  at that stuff  when I see it  out and about  it is natural  would you  would you like  would you breastfeed  in front of us  we don't have to see  yeah I don't care  I just fed her though  oh no you didn't  no I really did  so Norton's hungry  so we've kind of  heard from Rich  as far as like  you know 
[03:08:00]  having a baby  and stuff  at the age of 50  51  and now we need  to hear your side  of this whole thing  some of the fun  stories  well  I did offer  for Christmas  to get him  some DNA testing  because he's that  crazy  oh my god  when she was  first born  and we brought  her around  everyone kept  saying oh  you have a  Puerto Rican  baby  because she's  she's got  dark skin  you know  because Rich  does  right  you know  Rich is swarthy  and he 
[03:08:30]  that just  he thinks  somehow  somewhere  that  you had  sex  with somebody  should you  be picking  that up  holy shit  it's a baby  it's not a  he can handle it  Rich is like  I wouldn't trust  Rich with a baby  he's good  he's good  with the baby  except that  the last night  she started crying  and he goes  what the fuck  oh  first thing  yeah  wait  a little baby  but we're getting  off track here  and you guys  you gotta listen  to this  so he  truly believes 
[03:09:00]  you might have  had sex  with somebody else  and now you've  offered DNA  testing  for Christmas  yeah but what  if it was my  father  yeah so now  he thinks  it's his father  because the baby  does look exactly  like his father  no not my dad  I know my dad  didn't bang her  but  why the paranoia  there's just a  moral with your dad  I didn't go  everybody  see any guy  that has a baby  that's always  in their mind  because you can't  you know  you never know 
[03:09:30]  until  not every guy  you're paranoid  I know right  it's crazy  so now I have  a Puerto Rican  baby with blue eyes  it's insane  she  why would she  have a baby  with you  at the age of 51  unless she loved you  but like  why cheat  yeah why cheat  with a young  young strapping lad  and stay in the marriage  with you  she would just  get rid of you  yes whoever  she cheated with  would have to be  more successful  by the law  you know like 
[03:10:00]  like a plumber  or like a  Anthony is so  against babies  he won't even  turn and look  he likes babies  oh no I was  getting the little  camera  you don't hold  the baby  no  no way  I don't hold  babies  that baby  is beautiful  by the way  she's good too  look she's doing  the howl  she's doing a little  howl for you there  of course  the baby  starts crying  babies like me  you know what it is  that you can't  make eye contact  with them 
[03:10:30]  until they've  sussed you out  first  oh really  is that how it  works  that's how rich  is  don't make eye  contact  so any other  stories  as far as  rich voss goes  rich you really  this is a slight  doubt in your  mind that this  isn't your baby  all my kids  why  yeah one of the  first times I met  him he said he  had daughter and  I'm pretty sure  another one  why the paranoia  rich  it's called low  self-esteem 
[03:11:00]  a woman did you  wrong back in the  day  many of them  you actually  started with my  mother  DNA testing  here's the thing  is that we have  a TV show  we did a pilot  and one of the  story suggestions  I suggested for  the pilot was  that we get him  DNA testing to  prove that the  baby's his  right  and he wouldn't  do it because  he said it's  lose-lose  like right  he'll look stupid  if it is his  he is stupid  and you know  he'll be embarrassed  if it's not  by the way I 
[03:11:30]  barely heard what  Bonnie just said  because you got  some ample  cleavage that are  filled with  breast milk  you leaned over  I'm like wow  wait  you just see  when she's on  stage  God bless  newborn mothers  when she's on  stage and it  starts leaking  people think  she's a magic  I was at a  meeting and it  did you go up  a cup size or  so there  Bonnie  yeah a couple  a couple  yeah  wow 
[03:12:00]  anyway  sorry Rich  she leaned over  she's like trying  to tell this nice  story and I  all I saw was  her hands are  almost as big as  yours right  yeah  and she's  smarter  she's gonna  homeschool Rich  right  any other  any other  little stories to  share  well it's just 
[03:12:30]  you know  I don't know  when you have  a baby  I guess I  didn't realize  like I  thought I  loved Rich  right  oh boy  but then you  have a baby  and you realize  wow I had no  idea that you  know it could  get this much  you like your  baby  I love my  baby  that's what  everybody says  and then the  guy takes a  back seat  yeah  to the baby  it's just the  way it is  I don't care  I don't care  look at you  how long did you  know Rich  what's that 
[03:13:00]  how long did you  know Rich  um I guess  three and a half  four years  and how long  how old is the  baby  five months  five months  already  yeah  you barely even  know the kid  I know  and you know  Rich for like  years  there's not much  more to learn  about Rich  there's a lot  of things to  learn about this  baby though  the next 18  20  21  25  30 years  whatever  my ex-wife  is our babysitter  I know  oh we haven't  talked about this  on the air right  really  his ex-wife  is this kid's 
[03:13:30]  babysitter  yeah  she lives  you get along  with her  yeah I mean  I try not to  I don't want to  get too close  she's babysitting  no shit  huh  yeah  but Rich  well because  we had a hard  story I didn't  mean to interrupt  no go go  it was hard to  find a nanny  or a babysitter  you know you  can't just leave  a little baby  with anybody  so I mean  we drag her  around to all  the clubs  all the time  I just picked  your hand  that rocks  the cradle  right  that movie  yeah right  it's my baby  hey mommy  by the way 
[03:14:00]  I hope I got  I was hoping  I got away  with one  but no I did  not  Chris S.  from PA  Opie  what is a  newborn mother  I meant to say  a new mother  whatever  but Rich  and his ex-wife  both married  Canadians  yeah  I got my  green card  by the way  yeah  hey congrats  yeah so  three more years  to get my  citizenship  and he's  out of there  I don't need him  anymore  and you don't  and he is 
[03:14:30]  thinking that  crap in his head  deep down  you know that  right  I was hoping  it could be  a year and a half  oh yeah  alright Rich  like you're  gonna do better  than Bonnie  you're all cocky  she's a keeper  right there  and you're paranoid  and want DNA  testing  what's wrong  with you  she looks good  for after a baby  for after a baby  what does that mean  Rich  backhanded compliment  little backhand  compliment  you look almost  good for 51  50  I know 
[03:15:00]  I keep getting  older  one for a few  pounds on though  but I mean  I never thought  I'd see you  actually chubby  but you look  healthy  I'm not  whole baby  oh Norton  you know the work  I have to do now  yeah  she has to  like deprogram  Rich after his  appearances on our show  they're just trying  to get you  and stop looking  at my blue eyes  Rich  I had nothing  to do with this one  the kids even  looking at you  wow these are blue  oh that would be 
[03:15:30]  great  so how's the sex  life with you two  it's not  I think Rich  bitched about it  last time he was  on our show  I believe he did  right  I told Norton  the story  here I'll show  I'll hold the baby  well I  why don't you  walk the baby over  what's the matter  with you  I would  you know  it's just that  there's a crying  baby all the time  very cute baby  you don't want to  have sex with Rich  anymore Bonnie  not really  last time we  tried to have 
[03:16:00]  sex  alright the baby's  in the bathroom  next to me  I have a porn  in right  we gave up  at a porno  in  some girl  going down  on a guy  you know  you don't need to  they know what a  porno is  I don't know  if new mothers  are ready to go  back to watching  porn  this is true  I'm laying  I don't want to  try a different  angle  I got a porn  in  and then I got  one of those  little vibrating  you're a class  act man  I got one of  those vibrating  eggs in one  hand  you know the  little eggs  that vibrate  and I got a 
[03:16:30]  rubber on  a semi hard  penis  why a rubber  because I want  to get pregnant  again  so pull out  oh yeah that's  real safe  so I got a  my dick is  barely hard  this vibrating  thing in my  hand and I'm  looking at a porn  as I'm trying  to get in  and I'm shaking  the bassinet  because the  baby's crying  oh my god  is that true  yeah  oh my god  what was the egg  for  huh  what was the  egg for  for her pleasure  for her pleasure  you know  what is wrong 
[03:17:00]  with you  you need porn  and sex toys  and a baby  in the room  to have sex  with your wife  I was trying  to pretend  that the baby's  crying was the  porn  that was how  the lady was  getting  yeah  hey does  rich say  sexy things  uh he used  to he actually  used to be  really good  at sort of  yeah  saying sexy  things  yeah you know  you do a little  story or something  oh I tell a story  about you with  other guys  I would ask  oh god  that's not bad  is it  what during sex 
[03:17:30]  yeah  tell her to tell  me about  you know  her like  you know  meeting a guy  and blowing him  in front of me  and that would  get me like  real hard  or something  oh my gosh  she's holding  your child  he's a cuckold  yeah  don't you see  the craziness  of he thinks  I cheat on him  but he wants  me to tell  him those stories  it's all connected  it's all connected  rich wants you  to snowball  it's when someone  shoots in someone's  mouth and they  kiss another person  and they pass it  it's called a snowball 
[03:18:00]  oh  she's never seen  two girls in a cupper  really  yeah  show the baby  well did you show her  I didn't mean to say  you were fat  because  what was the word  he used before  oh  solar  solar  solar  flexes  no  yeah  he was showing us  his exercise equipment  on his  solar  flexes  yeah he goes  I have a pain  in my solar  flexes  I didn't say flex  did I  what is it  solar plex  no you didn't  no  correct  we stopped the entire  show to acknowledge  how you mispronounced 
[03:18:30]  that  six years  of coming here  the one hour  I did over there  I was so bad  because I was  in so much pain  and you started  off strong  I saw strong  but then I just  one of the two  strong base hits  and then a lot  of strikeouts  yeah but here's  the thing  and two  we were going  to go to the  doctors  and we never  brought the baby  up to the studio  and we think  the baby  you know  should be  part of the show  is it for  is it time  for breastfeeding  no she  I mean  I hear you 
[03:19:00]  whip it out  if you want  but  I'm seeing enough  you can't keep  those boobies  in your  top there  sorry Rich  I don't care  I feel guilty  looking at Bonnie's breast  it's a little weird  right  this pilot  I'm hearing  good things about  what are the chances  are you allowed  to talk about it  the idea is great  right  it's you two  on  can I say it  or no  yeah absolutely  it's you two  on the road  and trying to do comedy  and raise a child  basically on the road  as you do 
[03:19:30]  it's not on the road  so much  oh really  you changed it  a little bit  well we changed  the pilot  I don't want to  tell the whole story  in case they air  the pilot  if they pick it up  but it's basically  kind of  those crossover viewers  with lifetime  yeah  I like the picture  of you guys  in that magazine  by the way  the baby picture  you guys see that  no  you're in a maternity magazine  you're in a maternity magazine  oh boy  actually it had to do  with you guys  because the hospital 
[03:20:00]  heard that Rich  had said good things  about the hospital  on radio  so then they contacted us  to do a story  for their  in my county  everybody got this article  of us with the baby  sitting in our front lawn  of a townhouse  it's not really a front lawn  and so many people  come up  like  more people  more people have seen that  than my HBO special  for sure  for sure  yeah  this article  like everybody's coming up  to us in the supermarket  we saw you  you know  because we're the biggest  things that happen  at that hospital  the pilot 
[03:20:30]  though  is  you know  it's basically  an unscripted  sitcom reality  it's with real people  it's really  it's sitcom reality  well it's based on our lives  it's the only real thing  about it  action drama  cop show  it's based on our lives  with real people  like Larry David  with real people  right  you know  he uses actors  no he uses actors  he uses robots  you know  yeah  god  your  your  your kid is struggling 
[03:21:00]  to say  don't be stupid  dad  you want to say that  oh  very good  all right  well  you know  so the pilot  you know  we finished yesterday  the pickup shots  and  I don't know  we think it has a good shot  we really do  that'd be awesome  Steve from Bajor  has  in quotes  mommy make stupid  shut up  Steve 
[03:21:30]  she's very chubby cheeks  very kissable cheeks  oh thank you  oh the baby  she's beautiful  and what  Bonnie's ass  wait what's the baby's name again  Reyna  which is a Puerto Rican  a Latin queen  it's a Latin queen  it was supposed to be  R-E-Y-N-A  which means clean and pure  Yiddish  Israeli  I mean Hebrew  and I forgot  and spelt it wrong  at the hospital  when I asked  so I'm sure the father  will be pleased  in Spanish  surprised you to spell 
[03:22:00]  R-A-I-N-Y  it means wet out  so now your kid  is named after  a Latin queen  that's just perfect  for you Rich  perfect  how pretty  she's gorgeous  daddy doesn't have to say  it a stranger  like myself  we should enter that  Regis and Kathie Lee  cute baby contest  but we don't have  what happened to us  oh god  thank god you said it  what happened  this is Ant's nightmare  right in front of his eyes 
[03:22:30]  yeah because I see  it's like when  people went to sleep  next to the bean pods  in Invasion of the Body Snatchers  they just turn into  something else  that they dreaded  but once they do it  they're like  no this is great  everyone should do it  no you don't  I mean  there's some embarrassment  about it for sure  well we flew  one time to Atlanta  and coming home  we were in first class  ooh  fancy boy  first class with a baby  you should be thrown  out of the plane 
[03:23:00]  someone made his  numbers at the club  oh the people  under their breath  you could hear them  going oh fuck  exactly  because you don't  want a baby  in first class  for fuck's sake  she didn't make a peep  she didn't make a peep  and they started  tipping Bonnie almost  walking off the plane  right now  she's making a lot of noise  oh are you making a peep  I comfort her  my voice comforts her  yeah is that it  the kid stops  she loves me  you won't let Anthony  hold the baby  I'm not holding a baby  I'm not holding the baby 
[03:23:30]  he's cute  why  I've had to hold the baby  before  under like I've had to  I will not hold the baby  little Jimmy will hold the baby  how do I hold her  I don't want to hold her wrong  I'm not by her vagina  hold her like  hold her like  it's a cock  so it'll be tight  is this right like this  oh don't cry  don't cry  put her up  go like this  boom boom boom boom  what do you cry for  what do you cry for  what do you cry for  let the baby cry  give her back  god damn it  no I  I was pinching her

[03:24:30]  she's shy  before we get out of here  give them a little nipple  give them a little  quick breastfeed  I can't look  we can't look at  Bonnie's nipples  not show them  and then we'll show  her breastfeeding  so  no one's ever  came in here  and breastfed  you'll be the first  we've had girls  that sprayed  their breast milk  at us  oh really  it was fun  we had to run  and hide  we had to play  a little game  of make sure  the breast milk  doesn't hit you  you could spray it  oh my god  yeah  we had a breast milk  spraying contest  once  see how far 
[03:25:00]  they could spray it  oh my god  wow  those are some  good moms  um  I just  I just like that  you know  my husband is like  come on  whip it up  show you  the breastfeed  cause he's gonna  cause it's gonna  make him really hard  later when he thinks  about it  my wife showed  her titten  for all my friends  how naughty she was  right  you're a creep  I mean you can  think these things  I'm not  I'm not even gonna  question that  but to actually  bring it up  in front of your  wife and friends  I can't believe

[03:31:30]  was up  and then  i proceeded  to describe  in detail  the two  and a half  to three  foot  piece  of shit  that was  in the  toilet  that came  out of  my body  in one  continuous  piece  he cannot  stop talking  about his  logs  i know  that's a  childhood  thing  proud of  making a  duty  i'll tell  you what  happened  though  the girl  came home  with some  of that  aloe  water  what is  it 
[03:32:00]  no not  aloe  cleanse  it's  what's  the  stuff  in like  lotion  aloe  just  aloe  aloe  vera  there's  water  wait  this is  your girl  now  you talked  about this  yes  opie talks  to his  beautiful girl  about logs  a lot  not just  occasionally  but a lot  not a lot  you do  once is  enough  but a lot  once every  once is too  much  once every  hour  but that's  very child  that's very  that's very  childhood  that's very  very much  but babies 
[03:32:30]  point at their  duties and stuff  at the toilet  right that's a  big thing  it's like look  what i did  look what i made  but see i gotta  defend myself  like i'm not  attacking you  i never even  acknowledged my  stupid duties  until we started  doing morning  radio and it's  it's it's a  mess so you're  saying childhood  if he talks  about it  no no no  not to your  buddies  what do you  call that  expensive  no no i'm  not saying  that in a  bad way  i'm just  saying it's  a very  like like  little boys 
[03:33:00]  will show  their mommies  what they  do i mean  i you know  it's a love  thing it's  almost it's  almost like  duty have  you ever  had a  three-footer  i've had  some big  ones  three  i'll even  i'll even  describe it  this way i  looked down  the bowl  and i was  so amazed  because while  i was going  i'm like man  i never i  never felt the  pinch off  what the  fuck right  so out  of curiosity  i took some  toilet paper  and carefully  moved the  toilet paper  that was in  the bowl  i had a  look  oh my 
[03:33:30]  god  this is  disgusting  and there  was coverage  well it was  covered up  and i'm like  i gotta know  because i never  felt the  pinch right  this is what  i saw  round and  round and  round three  complete circles  and then  then it just  kind of  shot up like  like a snake  you're standing  to attention  almost popping  out of the  water  he's proud  of his duty  and then i  and then i  started kind  of figuring  out how  long it  was and  i got  close to 
[03:34:00]  three feet  can a  psychologist  please call  in  oh man  that's  something  i'm telling  you  yeah you  got some  kind of  duty thing  can a  police artist  come in  and  sketch it  your duties  are very  important to  you  more so  than  anybody  else i  know  and i  explained  why  so we  don't need  psychologists  or anything  else  the stupid  show  prevents me  from shitting  regularly  and then on  saturdays and  sundays  i'll no  problem because  we're sleeping  regular hours  and it's four 
[03:34:30]  or five times  each day  that could be  a lot of  people but  you feel  compelled to  talk about  it  i don't even  mind hearing  about it  it should be  a show on  vh1 behind  the duty  thank you  before it  was duty  i'm mad i  didn't take  a picture  but it  was this  aloe  water  thing  that's  kind of  like a  very  thick  like  almost  like  you're  it's  i don't  know  it's almost  like water  and like  lotion  in it  but it  doesn't taste  like lotion  i only did a

[03:44:00]  in  Bill  yo what's  up man  hey Bill  how are you  hey man  I almost  got sick  again just  listening to  that  yeah Bonnie  Bill  checked out  the video  he had a  tough time  with it  we got  Bonnie  the worst  the worst part  I think  is when  the girl  starts  like  looking  like  she's  going  to start  blowing  bubbles  with the  shit  yeah  she's  getting  the gum  ready  for a  bubble  she's  rolling it  around in  her mouth  roll this  around in  your mouth  right  oh  it's 
[03:44:30]  dry even  when I  just hear  the music  to it  I know  yeah  it really  is bad  and I  know  that the  internet  does  desensitize  you to  stuff  because  it doesn't  even bother  me in  the least  anymore  and I  was  like  disgusted  to where  I was  going to  puke  when I  first saw  it  but it's  like being  in  in Vietnam  you know  after a while  the replacements  come in  and you're  surprised at  how they  react  and you're  just like  ah  here comes  a replacement  I find  it hilarious  yeah  just duty  now  will make  me feel  ill  yeah 
[03:45:00]  you know  now I  could look  at any  duty  now I  watch  that  it's  nothing  you almost  realistic  it's a  really weird  piece  who are  like how  they're  Brazilian  they're  Brazilian  that explains  MFX is  Brazilian  yeah they  need a bus  fare  they're very  very poor  there  they'll do  a lot  he has  really great  porn  hey  Connie  did your  baby check  out the  video at  all  it put  her right  to sleep  she was  like oh  that again  oh that's  old hat 
[03:45:30]  yeah  I love  this one  so what's  up Bill  I'll tell you  what's up  absolutely  nothing  really  I like  to move  out to  LA  right before  the writers  strike  oh that's  right  oh Bill  holy shit  this is how  you should  know I  have nothing  going on  is I'm  fucking up  early enough  to call you  guys  I'm gonna  go join a  gym  maybe take  up squash  a highlight  every day  it's like 
[03:46:00]  it's like  it's the  holidays out  here  it's like  nobody on  the road  it's over  you go  out there  to be  near  where  the TV  shows are  made  and other  things that  you want  to do  you pick up  and move  out there  and they're  fucking on  strike  I didn't  even think  about that  it was going  great too  I had a TV  show idea  getting ready  to pitch it  I was  killing on  my auditions  hey who's  this new  guy out  here  and then  the only  thing that's  been entertaining  is been  watching the 
[03:46:30]  writers on  like their  picket lines  because writers  are like  naturally like  introverted  people  now they gotta  be outside  trying to do  that one  two  three  four  you know  that yelling  strike shit  they're horrific  at it  they all have  like those  black framed  glasses and  they're sort  of looking down  sheepishly at  the ground  feeling stupid  walking around  this would be a  good sketch  on king of  queens  that sucks 
[03:47:00]  poor bastard  I didn't even  think about that  we should come  back to New  York for a while  what am I  gonna do  I'll do it  sleep on the  couch in my  old apartment  where are you  living in LA  I actually got a  great place  I'm out here  in East LA  what  a bunch of  Mexicans  are you really  I'm not gonna  tell them where  I live  I live in the  greater Los  Angeles area  that's smart  Bill  Bill's learned 
[03:47:30]  a thing or two  from this show  you almost got me  you asked me that  nonchalantly  I lived in Los  Filos  when I was out  there  I told people  where I was  I mean I  wouldn't get in  the street  but I told  people I was  in Los  Filos  you're a  braver man  than I am  Jimmy  they love you  they won't  bother you  you never  had any  son of Sam  looking dude  with postal  shoes  just standing  outside your  apartment staring  a couple days  later  those are the 
[03:48:00]  ones that show  up at our  shows  hey Bill  why don't you  become a  paparazzi  or something  and try to  get some  Britney  freaking video  you know what  I missed that  whole thing  what happened  to her  she lost  her shit  again  yeah  Billy are they  the movies  you're still  auditioning for  movies aren't you  don't answer  them Bill  oh no you know  what  oh you motherfuckers  don't answer  no no  I'm saying  hang up on me  no I'm saying  it's a bad  question  no it isn't  a bad question  are you still  auditioning for  movies  no I actually  got a good  one actually  I got a part 
[03:48:30]  this director  that I knew  hooked me up  and then  some producers  were like no  fuck you  I have a better  friend  and they gave  them a part  but the  writer strikes  affecting movies  too  yeah I know  but still  there's other  movies  independent films  that are  still filming  and casting  I'm sure  there's movies  that are already  written  that are still  oh yeah  there you are  but they can't  shoot them  I don't think  because they  can't do any  rewrites  that's the problem  they have to do  rewrites on the  sets  they can't do  them  film it as is  no rewrites 
[03:49:00]  no golden globes  obviously who gives  a shit  but there's going  to be a lot  of other shows  canceled  I know  how is this  going to end  with our show  getting picked up  never is  well reality shows  have a great shot  right now  so Rich and Bonnie  might be in the  perfect position  how's Leno doing  has he beat  Letterman in the  ratings  yeah  still  well  yeah I think so  hey what's the deal  if you do Leno  are you crossing  the picket line  I think so  I don't know  I like Jake  I feel really  I think they put him  in a really weird  position  but then again 
[03:49:30]  Letterman's the only  one back  it's not like  anybody else is  yeah but Letterman  had Tom Hanks  on  Conan's back too  no no I mean  they all are  but with his  writers  but Letterman  had Tom Hanks  on  Leno can't have  Tom Hanks  on right now  because Letterman  has his own  production company  that made a deal  no I know  for the most part  we know  that's why  Craig Ferguson's  on too  he's under the  umbrella  basically what  that means  Letterman gets  to have legitimate  big time stars  on his show  and Leno  really can't  because a lot  of guys are 
[03:50:00]  scared they're  crossing the  picket line  like Burgess said  I wanted to say  that we are  not though  what  we'll do any  show  oh my god  fucking leave  we'll leave  in five minutes  to do Leno  we do not  care  Roland  they're still  filming movies  that's just  like you  to try to  break the  union  of course  I do  we got  Roland in  studio  Roland  yeah no  they're still  filming movies  but not  a lot  of them  but Leno  is beating  Letterman  though  he got  like a  7-4 share 
[03:50:30]  and Letterman  got a 5 share  but who's Leno  having on  go  anybody who  would do them  like friends  and people  but who  cast of friends  who's the biggest  name that Leno's  had since he  came back  Letterman easily  it's either  Robert Williams  or Tom Hanks  either Howie Mandel  or Huckabee  he's like  the biggest guy  Howie did his show  that's interesting  well Howie's a reality  show too  is his written  or no  it's a reality  it's a game show  right  now he probably  don't have to work  but eventually 
[03:51:00]  that game show  is going to go away  and he's going to  need to  yeah no  Letterman has  everybody  I don't know  if he's crossing  the line by doing  Leno  no I don't know  that's a  interesting question  if you  Leno  Kim or any  of the shows  are not  WGA approved  the only thing  that annoys me  about that  and I understand  I've been  kind of behind  the WGA  but let's just  say that you're  a comedian  and only Leno  will book you  and you've had  a relationship  with Leno  now I know  I've done  Letterman too  but I'm saying  what are you  supposed to do  like not do  television  but whereas  comedians who  Letterman likes 
[03:51:30]  can do  like  I think  you shouldn't  do it  I think  you shouldn't  do it  just because  eventually  if you write  something  you don't want  to get  you don't want  to get fucked  no I know  I mean  I wouldn't  like just for  self-interest  but I mean  it's a weird  decision  I think  they kind of  put  like  it's a weird  place to put  Leno in a weird  position like that  Conan can't get  anybody too  well Leno put himself  in that position  no he didn't  tonight's show  is owned by NBC  that's not a Leno  thing  Leno is supporting  his writers  you know what I mean  but there's nothing  he can do  he can't say  he can't say  I don't want  to go in the air  no  and he has to 
[03:52:00]  he's going to  lose his gig  yeah he had no  choice  he can't lose  his gig  in the end  you don't want  to lose your gig  no I just  didn't know  what the  situation was  he's in a really  tough position  that's why Carson  came back too  yeah he was the  first one  he told him  basically  either come back  or he'll lose  his gig  what are they  going to do  alright  they're going to  fire Jay Leno  who's been  killing everybody  for 15 years  and then try  some new schluck  well Bill  his contract's  just about up  so why not  they don't have  much loyalty  to Jay at this  point  yeah  Leno doesn't  want to go  away  obviously he's  going to go  somewhere else 
[03:52:30]  he's decided  fuck that  I want to  continue doing  this  hopefully not  in that type  of language  yeah he said  fuck that  oh no  yeah he texted  me on the way  home yesterday  after I saw  Steve Buscemi  walk by  yes saw him  on the street  yesterday  I had to  point out to  everybody  because I  wasn't sure  they were  going to  pick up  on it  but I  left XM  walking down  the sidewalk  and Buscemi  is walking  up the sidewalk  and I was  starstruck  and I just  stared at him  like a creep 
[03:53:00]  and he knew  I was staring  at him  like a creep  like alright  buddy Jesus  and started  walking up the  hill  and he looks  like he's  just annoyed  all the time  I don't know  if he is  I don't know  anything about him  so then I  start point  and who's  like kind  of at the  front of XM  with a bunch  of the guys  just hanging  before he went  home and I  start frantically  pointing at  him to the  point  Buscemi even  felt like  something was  going on  turned around  and now  sees me  frantically  pointing at  him  I'm like  I'm such  a freaking  nerd  I'm looking  at Opie  because I  didn't know  what he was  pointing at  until like  Steve Buscemi 
[03:53:30]  gets right  near me  and then I  just went  hi Steve  Buscemi  I don't know  why I felt  compelled to  both names  hi Steve  Buscemi  he just went  like how  you doing  hey man  I was on  a set  with him  I was on  a set  with him  my one word  impression  did he have  his baseball  hat on  yes he did  he did  how do you  know that  I guess  when you get  famous you gotta  buy a hat  the big baseball  hat  yeah  and then  oh and  something else  before we 
[03:54:00]  wrap up the  show  Anthony had an  interesting phone  call with Tom  Chiasano  we had these  show meetings  after the show  and we're a little  punch drunk  so we get  really silly  and Jimmy  came up  with an idea  some things  are to be  taken as  jokes also  oh boy  uh  yeah  yeah I guess  but Tom  wasn't sure  which is the  beauty of what  we're about  oh I know  so what was  the  they were trying  to find a  promotion  with pancakes  something to  do with  pancakes  and what is  that about  again  can you believe  that  Semi Pro 
[03:54:30]  oh Semi Pro  does something  with pancakes  so they want  us to jump  on board  and do some  kind of  pancake promotion  to promote  the movie  and we're  sitting here  going  what the fuck  are we going  to do  with pancakes  so  Jimmy  is such  a sharp  quick wit  he came  up with  an idea  that would  be hysterical  with pancakes  and Jimmy  for you  would please  I said  that we  should all  make a stack  and then we  all lay on 
[03:55:00]  them and put  our hard-ons  into them  and we could  see how  many  whoever  penetrates  the most  pancakes  wins  like with  my rod  so I have  a rod  oh god  Jimmy  why do you  have a rod  right now  you'll say  I got distracted  during the chat  oh my god  I was watching  JFK last night  that would do it  oh  oh  any more champagne  what's going on here  any more champagne  yeah  so Jimmy's idea  was how many 
[03:55:30]  how many pancakes  how many pancakes  each one of us  could get our rods  through and whoever  can have the more  most pancakes  on our rods  or no  to just penetrate  like chopping  through bricks  they'd have to be  like a big old  school  yeah  you wouldn't want  to worry about tearing  I want to be a  five or six  pancake man  yeah  five or six  pancakes are thin  they're thin  you little fruit  I want to stack  I just want to  jam my cock  into them  and push down 
[03:56:00]  and see where  the helmet print ends  yeah but that sucks  because after that  every time you want  to have sex  to get hard  you gotta go  honey can you  make some pancakes  now please  he was ready  oh yeah  please  it was not a long  enough set up  yeah  hey Billy  good seeing you  talking to you  good luck out there  you don't know  where to go  I do  you're using that  bomb as an excuse  to get out of here  I gotta go to your  family  I got a doctor  appointment  all right  all right  the enola gay
