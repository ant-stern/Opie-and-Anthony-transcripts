<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a highly irreverent and vulgar affair, characterized by offensive jokes, sexually explicit content, and chaotic listener interaction.  The show began with planning for their upcoming St. Patrick's Day broadcast at the Hard Rock Cafe,  including details about a planned messy green egg-eating contest with Pat from Menachie and recollections of previous chaotic St. Patrick's Day shows, including a listener urinating on himself.  They discussed their relationship with listeners, distinguishing between "fans" and "pests,"  and recounted anecdotes from F.H. Riley's, a restaurant owned by a caller's brother,  which frequently served as a backdrop for their off-air shenanigans.  The fallout from their listeners' campaign against radio personality Pharrell, resulting in his departure from Sirius, was also a major topic, along with listener calls regarding XM Satellite Radio's financial state and a potential legal threat against listeners from a former associate of Pharrell.  A significant portion focused on fundraising efforts for Pat from Menachie's trailer repairs. Jim Norton was present in studio, along with several other individuals identified by nicknames: Master Poe, E-Rock, Big A, Bam, Drew Boogie, No Filter Paul, Fish, and Denise (No Filter Paul's wife).  Anthony unveiled his "Opie Penis Cam," a series of low-angle photos of patrons at F.H. Riley's (including many of the aforementioned individuals and Elmo) available on opiananthony.com, and announced an unofficial Opie and Anthony, Pest, Late Night Karaoke event there.

The broadcast then shifted to the Daytona 500, Jimmy Johnson's win, and his previous appearance on the show, followed by a discussion of Paltalk issues, specifically on-camera masturbation.  Jim Norton's need for deviated septum surgery was mentioned.  A substantial portion was dedicated to their fascination with the Winter Olympics curling competition, including detailed analysis of strategy, players (like Cassie and a blonde Russian curler), and equipment, along with a bet placed on a U.S./Canada match.  Numerous listener calls discussed curling, the Olympics in general, and the perceived "gayness" of Olympic sports.  A Photoshop image of the hosts curling was also mentioned.

The show continued with a discussion of a female snowboarder's fall during a race, her post-race interview with Bob Costas (including a clip), and her Visa commercials.  The hosts then attempted to name other famous Olympic athletes, revealing their limited knowledge.  A limo driver called in, providing details about the snowboarderâ€™s life, eliciting the hosts' typical mocking responses. This segment also featured a discussion of the "year of the gay," referencing *Brokeback Mountain* and a gay-themed *Charlie Brown* stage adaptation, and highlighted instances of crying in sports, using clips of a wrestling fan, a child shot with a BB gun, and Tom Sizemore at sentencing.  A caller recounted a jump scare prank on his girlfriend.  The hosts planned to collect regional items from listeners for the studio.

A caller described playing loud Iron Man theme music to scare his son.  The hosts then discussed Nix Marie, a deceased child, and transitioned to an in-studio appearance by Sherrod from "Best Week Ever," as well as discussing Celebrity Fit Club, Jeff Conway's participation, a NASCAR feud, and bump drafting. A Bill Burr clip from Letterman, featuring jokes about George W. Bush and overweight children, was played.  A caller named Frank, described as a "hillbilly," discussed his life in North Carolina near Camp Lejeune and personal details.  The conversation then moved to "T. Man," a listener who tasered his testicles and anus during a Paltalk broadcast;  video clips from Paltalk, including a man inserting objects into his rectum, were shown, along with discussions about arranging for T. Man to repeat the act live on the show.  The hosts promoted a karaoke event and the planned "Office Cam" segment.  A "Guess the Sound" game featuring pornographic sounds was played.  A phone call with T. Man and his partner Lori ended the segment, with Lori describing T. Man's habit and T. Man preparing to tase himself live on air.

The final segment featured a listener-submitted video of a man ("Hillbilly") receiving repeated taser shocks to his genitals from his wife.  The hosts described the video graphically, focusing on the sounds and reactions.  The hosts commented on the video's quality and attempted to offer guidance on better camera angles.  A "Guess the Sound" segment featuring the taser video audio followed, but E-Rock accidentally deleted the video, leading to further humorous reactions.  An alternative video, depicting a man using his testicles to hit a butt plug, was then discussed.  Calls from listeners and mentions of Mort Gooder, Turtle from Whack Bag, and Sherrod were included.  The hosts promoted upcoming appearances and events before concluding with closing remarks and jokes.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts repeatedly used homophobic slurs, racial slurs, and other offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for coffee.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I'm scared of you. 
[00:04:30]  I'm scared of you, sir, and I'm protecting myself.  I am protecting myself.  I am scared of you.  Please call the police.  You're a phony.  Hey, this guy's a great big phony.  What's that supposed to be?  Some kind of sick joke?  You better get your head and your ass wired together, or I will take a giant shit out of you.  You said I can smell your cunt.  ONA Body Rock! 
[00:05:00]  Beyond AM, Beyond FM, it's XM Satellite Radio.  Hey, you guys.  Oh, my nose!  ONA Body Rock!  Dylan.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Stop whining.  Stop it!  Stop it!  Quiet.  Quiet.  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  Quiet.  Do you want to kiss me?  Sure.  Quiet.  Stop it! 
[00:05:30]  Hey, what's up, man?  It's the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  How are you?  I'm doing good.  I'm doing good.  How are you?  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I would like to just get to know you.  You lack discipline.  I want to say hi to all the pests.  And I also want to say hi to just the basic fan.  Wow.  That's what I do today.  The basic fan gets a little recognition today. 
[00:06:00]  They don't get enough acknowledgement.  Yeah.  A lot of people came up to me over the weekend like, hey, I'm not a pest.  I'm just a listener.  I'm just a fan.  Is that okay?  Yes, it is.  It's definitely okay.  Unfortunately, it's usually the squeaky wheel.  The squeaky, annoying, pest-like wheel that gets the grease.  A lot of these guys, they don't want the grease.  They just want to be known as a fan.  Just a fan. 
[00:06:30]  Just a listener.  I said, I listen.  They support a little bit.  I don't go to the events.  I don't go to a pal talk.  Don't even have a wow on the vehicle.  But I listen to the show.  Matter of fact, they barely even help the virus that is known as the ONA virus.  Now, come to think of it, take your XM, flush it down the toilet.  As far as the virus goes.  Et cetera, et cetera.  They will sneeze in someone else's face, but their hand will be over their mouth. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, they'll cough with their hand over their mouth, turn their head.  Right.  A person might get sick.  A person might not.  Then you got the pest.  Recommend zinc to people.  And the pest that walks right up to a non-fan and sneezes really hard.  No hands.  No tissues.  Yeah.  Right into your face, hoping you get the ONA virus.  The pests sneeze into their hands and then shake, shake, shake.  Yeah.  Shake everyone's hand.  But that's what's going on today.  We know there are pests. 
[00:07:30]  And we know there are just fans.  Right.  Or listeners that just enjoy what we do.  We acknowledge them, too.  They might get a t-shirt once every couple of years, maybe.  But probably not.  The pests, they're just on opianathlete.com every day waiting for the next t-shirt to arrive.  Next little item.  I hear there's pests, shirts, and hats now.  Yeah.  There's everything.  They got their own marketing.  My brother's working on a shirt for our St. Paddy's Day broadcast.  Aye.  Is that official?  I think it is.  We're going to be at the Hard Rock Cafe, it looks like. 
[00:08:00]  I think without all the details hammered out, it's official, though, that we're going to do it.  And we're going to start the show late morning?  Yes, because drinking at 7 a.m. for, well, probably 5% of our audience isn't good.  No.  So we'll have details later on this week about the big St. Paddy's Day broadcast.  We weren't going to do it, but then we realized last year's was so much fun.  No, it wasn't, if you remember.  It was really annoying, but a year has gone by, and it makes it seem like it was fun. 
[00:08:30]  No, I had fun.  And now it's going to take five minutes of the broadcast this year for us to realize,  Oh my God, that's why we said this wasn't a good idea.  I had fun when the listeners lined up for their racist jokes, which is going to be a yearly  tradition now, by the way.  Oh, okay.  Is that what St. Paddy's Day is all about, Opie?  Really?  Okay, I know it is, but.  As long as we make fun of everybody, it's okay.  It got a little ugly there for a while last year.  It certainly did.  And then Black Girl.  Remember Black Girl getting auctioned?  That wasn't fun? 
[00:09:00]  Holy shit.  You don't remember that?  Yes, I remember the winning bid by Ron and Fez.  And they still are holding to that deal.  You don't remember that stripper that was trying to talk to, what?  How many people were there?  I don't want to overestimate.  There were a lot of people there.  There was close to 1,000 people there, probably.  More than that, I think like 12,000, 15,000.  Yeah, it could have been more than that.  And then.  I remember, my fondest memory of that day was the guy that got up on stage and pissed himself. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  For a MIFI.  Right.  He stood up there, concentrating look on his face, until water ran down the front of his pants.  But, we were supposed to have somebody swallow a knife, and you guys told me no.  Yeah, well, when the EMTs that were on staff said.  You guys fucked up that one.  Probably not a good idea.  You guys fucked that one up.  Yeah, we fucked that one up.  It was the guy that performed surgery on himself.  We fucked it up so badly, Opie, that we're still sitting here a year later with a fucking job. 
[00:10:00]  Guess you're right.  Because if that guy would have swallowed a knife, fired.  Remember that lunatic, though?  Of course.  He, like, performed surgery on himself, and he wanted to swallow a knife or cut off a cyst or something.  Yeah, he had removed some cysts from himself and does any operations he needs on himself.  Right.  Well, it's going to be St. Paddy's Day, I guess, at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Details coming very, very soon.  We want to do a green, hard-boiled egg eating contest. 
[00:10:30]  You don't know who that's going to include.  Pat from Menachie.  I was discussing this potential contest with Pat from Menachie at FH Riley's over the weekend.  Yes.  Maybe he could call in because we were trying to discuss how this would work.  My phone's been turned off.  I don't know if I could call.  We just want a huge pile of green, hard-boiled eggs, and the contestants have to just eat and eat until they puke.  Well, he's a pro now.  And until one contestant is standing.  That'll be the big highlight at our St. Paddy's Day broadcast. 
[00:11:00]  Unless another ringer comes in and beats him, I can't see anybody beating Pat since he is a professional.  What's-his-name-was-not-a-ringer in the eggnog drinking contest.  Well, he was-  He beat Pat by half a shot.  I know, because Pat had experience in the eggnog thing.  Right.  Kind of weighed out the professionalism of the other fat guy.  What the hell was his name?  Anyone remember?  Oh, man.  Dead before he was 40?  He was really cool.  He's from Long Island.  He's a professional eater from Long Island.  Somebody will come up with a name on him. 
[00:11:30]  The big fat black guy.  Yeah.  Somebody on his feedback will help us out with that.  Pete on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, I was at the restaurant over the weekend.  It was a great place.  You got a hit on your hand.  I appreciate that.  My brother's restaurant's blowing up.  400 New York Avenue in Huntington.  It's called FH Riley's.  It's just off Main Street there.  And every weekend, I'm pretty much there, because I'm supporting my brother.  And Saturday was a huge surprise.  I didn't know Anthony was going.  I don't like announcing these things.  I didn't want the place to be completely flooded with people, fans, Opie. 
[00:12:00]  So I just drop in unannounced.  If I could make an observation about Anthony being there.  At one point, I looked over, and I saw Anthony's table.  It looked like he had his hands out, palms up, and an oar around his head.  Did it look like the Last Supper?  It looked like the Last Supper over there.  Anthony was holding court.  Yes.  And Paul, no filter.  That guy's got to be the loudest man in the room.  You know what?  I openly hate no filter Paul. 
[00:12:30]  I know he's good for the radio show, but there's just something about him I can't stomach.  Well, Opie, and the sky is blue, and the sun comes up in the morning, goes down at night.  These are things that are just accepted as fact in this world that we live in.  Everyone hates no filter Paul.  So obnoxious.  And then he's coming up to me every 15 minutes.  Did I do something wrong?  Did I do something wrong?  Why am I not on the show anymore?  You're no filter Paul.  That's what you did wrong.  Is it true I'm banned from the show?  Is it true?  Is it true?  Is it true?  Is it true?  Who said he was banned from the show? 
[00:13:00]  No one.  No one.  He'll be back in the show.  He's buying the rumors.  It makes sense.  And his wife was just sitting at the bar just drinking and drinking and drinking the martinis.  I've seen her hammered at events before.  Never as hammered as she was Saturday night.  Unbelievable.  She was, I have so many chocolate martinis, I can't even stay.  And then Paul Yellen making inappropriate comments at the top of his lungs.  He doesn't know how to.  But if you're going to tell an ethnic joke about somebody in the room or something, an observation, 
[00:13:30]  don't you turn and go, hey, dude, that guy look like or something.  He just blurts it out like almost right to the guy's face.  It was just.  That's why he's called no filter Paul.  He doesn't have that filter that normal humans have to keep their, for self-preservation.  And I asked him flat out, I'm like, how far do you live from FH Riley's?  And he said 125 miles, and I went, thank God.  Thank God. 
[00:14:00]  There's no possibility he would become a regular.  Was he being loud?  Because we don't want his kind at our place.  Loud?  He knows no other way.  He was being loud and inappropriate.  Yeah.  That's what he does.  It was Badlands Booker, by the way, in the eating contest.  That's the guy.  Let's just get this out of the way.  Mike on Long Island.  Mike, what's up?  B-b-b-boys.  Hey, we're meeting with our old boss, Brucey Mittman.  Brucey Mittman.  We're taking a meeting with Bruce Mittman, our old boss from the Boston days. 
[00:14:30]  In the near future.  By the way, Opie, I love the little error you made.  That is so goddamn funny.  Apparently there's some correspondence going back and forth between Opie and Bruce Mittman.  He called me out of the blue last week.  I didn't recognize the number, so I picked up, which is very rare for me.  And it was him.  I'm like, oh, wow.  Boys, boys.  So he wants to hook up, have a little, you know, what have we been doing lately kind of meeting and stuff.  Talk a little business.  He actually has an agency.  Yeah.  And he has a few clients that are going to be advertising on this fine channel. 
[00:15:00]  That's fantastic.  I love Brucey, man.  I could sit down and have dinner with that guy.  Absolutely.  So I guess you've been trading some emails with him, and a date was hammered out, and you wanted to check with me if that date was okay with me.  Right.  So Opie sends the email, and it says, dude, here's the date.  Please, I don't want to do this alone.  Show up.  It wasn't even please.  Yeah.  It was just, yeah, I don't want to do this alone.  You got to make it in. 
[00:15:30]  It'll make good radio for the next day.  And sends it off to Brucey Mittman.  All I see is the reply, and it's Brucey going, I think this was intended for Anthony.  I went gulp, like, thank God.  Oh, really?  Go at it.  And then I wrote something like, Bruce, don't read too much into that email.  It's just a known fact that I take a lot of meetings by myself.  Yeah.  And I thought it would be good that Anthony did this one with us. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  You know, with us.  I was like, shit, I hope he buys that.  Oh, you had a good out.  I hope he buys that.  Whenever Ops says, don't read too much into this, you should read every line.  There's words in every letter.  Yeah, and there's meaning in between the lines.  It's all bad.  There's hidden meanings and codes.  Right.  Mike, anything else?  Yeah, man.  I was at the police on Saturday night.  Yeah.  I have a suggestion, not an observation.  Yeah.  If Big A's going to be hanging out there at all. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, my God.  He was scaring all the patrons.  Yes, he was.  He was scaring everybody.  And someone noticed he just likes to stare at me for some reason.  I'm like, is he going to freaking eat my face?  What's going on with him?  You're blonde-haired and handsome.  He just looks at you.  We saw Big A at the cellar, too, Friday night.  I had a great weekend.  I was at the cellar.  Esty took care of me down there.  Saw some great comedy.  Jimmy was on stage trying out his new material.  Yeah.  And, matter of fact, Sherrod's coming in today from VH1. 
[00:17:00]  Best week ever.  And Big A showed up.  And he wasn't shaven.  And, dude, he looks like he's a real problem.  He's a creepy dude.  He's got those creepy eyes.  But he's the nicest guy, I got to tell you.  He's a sweetheart.  I talked to him a little bit at FH Riley's on Saturday.  And he's a nice guy.  But he's just got that scary look.  Andrew, you're welcome to come around.  Just leave your face.  Don't bring your big googly eyes and your frightening child killer face.  Just bring a hat and your shirt. 
[00:17:30]  That's your observation, Mike?  Yeah, man.  That's all.  And I intentionally didn't shake your hand.  I gave you a little pat on the arm.  I shook so many hands Saturday night.  People, I really have a bad rap here that I don't shake hands.  And it's so funny to watch people come up to me to go to shake my hand.  And then at the last minute, like, withdraw their hand and make the fist punch thing.  Yeah.  I just started laughing.  Yes.  There's always Purell hand sanitizer.  No, I shake people's hands.  I got to tell you, Saturday was the night to be at FH Riley's, man. 
[00:18:00]  You never know what night it's going to be.  I had no idea.  I was just hanging out, checking out the place and making sure things are running smooth, whatever.  And Anthony was there.  Master Poe was there.  Big A was there.  Pat from Menaki was there.  E-Rock showed up.  A lot of the pest, a lot of the O&A Army brass were there.  I was very surprised.  Royalty.  It was just a mob scene on Saturday, and it looks like everyone had a good time.  There was some kind of lady that writes for some really, really fancy food magazine in New York City, 
[00:18:30]  and she already wants to do a story on my brother and his food.  The food is just getting rave reviews, man.  Huh?  Mike's a great bartender, by the way.  That's my brother-in-law, Fish.  Yeah.  He's there every weekend, too.  Yeah, man.  Thank you, Mike.  All right, boys.  Later.  All right.  And did you enjoy the food at FH?  I loved it.  I had the half-roasted chicken.  Yeah.  Very good.  Yeah.  Patates.  Yeah.  Some of them patates.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really good stuff.  Master Poe was ranting and raving about the food as well. 
[00:19:00]  And you can't lose with Guinness on tap.  We thought about you when we were getting those taps in there.  Right.  When I walked in there, first thing that was handed to me, nice, creamy Guinness.  Yeah.  It's becoming the place to hang out.  Yeah.  It was packed.  Like I said, last week, the show's becoming more of a lifestyle night.  Now there's even a place to hang out.  And if this place goes well, you never know.  Maybe we'll throw a few more out there.  We had an entire table that was pretty much the length of the dining room against one of  the walls full of pests. 
[00:19:30]  Just pests sitting there and enjoying.  And then another pest overflow table.  I was starstruck up.  So was I.  I was walking around the dining room going, oh my God, I've seen your face on Pal Talk  every morning.  I've seen you.  I've seen yours.  I met the hole.  The hole.  The hole was there.  The hole was there.  Who?  Who?  The hole.  The hole.  The hole was the hole.  Oh, I know.  The hole.  The actual hole was at F.H. Riley's.  You know, you're right.  This, this, you know, when we play these clubs. 
[00:20:00]  Janine, yeah.  She was taking pictures with people.  Oh, come on.  She was a celebrity.  She was throwing out some lines.  It was great.  Yeah, and she made more hole, hole things for us.  Good.  But she was there.  She's, I didn't realize she was part of that point blank thing.  That band on Long Island that is very, very cool.  Yep.  She either dates one of them or is the manager or something.  There's a connection.  I forgot what the connection is.  You insulted her when she was here.  I did, actually.  Actually, I was telling Anthony about that. 
[00:20:30]  She sent me an email that I hurt her feelings.  And once in my life, I did the right thing and wrote a really long email back about how  awful of a person I really am.  You owe a few of those around this office.  Why don't you just fucking mass mail that?  But she wrote, you know, there's a lot of people that are like, I didn't like how you  treated me!  Exclamation point, exclamation point, exclamation point, exclamation point.  You are a capital D, capital I, capital Z, capital K, exclamation point. 
[00:21:00]  And I'm like, whatever.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, angry typing guy!  Angry typing guy!  Who never hits cap's lock.  He does it individually every time.  But she wrote this email, how I hurt her feelings in a way where I was like, oh man.  Oh man, you got to my soul, which is not easy to get to.  You feel all bad.  So I had to write her back and apologize and compliment her on other things so she feels 
[00:21:30]  good about herself.  You're a great whole.  But she actually, Janine's very, very nice.  Very nice.  So, E-Rock, you enjoyed your time at FH Riley's?  Yeah, the food was great.  Did you get hammered?  No.  No?  Oh, wow.  Most of the people got hammered there.  Nah.  What'd you have?  Had the steak.  Where's Master Poe?  Because he's hilarious.  So good.  Gentlemen.  Gentlemen, the food was terrific. 
[00:22:00]  Master Poe was holding court at Pest Table 2.  There had to be two tables.  There wasn't enough at the big, long, full length of the dining room table.  Actually, I got to take this time to just thank the fans of the show for showing up  because it was a horrible night on Long Island.  Holy shit.  Freezing cold and windy.  It was like 15 degrees out and the wind was blowing.  Huntington was completely dead.  No one was doing business.  But for some reason, everyone decided to show up at this FH Riley's on Saturday.  We didn't promote it.  We all just decided to go there, which is a pretty cool thing.  And that really helped out the business, which we desperately need at this point. 
[00:22:30]  I felt like I was at the Copa.  I liked the back door access there.  Being able to get out the back.  Yeah.  Get to my car right there.  Yeah.  It's also becoming a favorite hangout for some of the cops in the area.  That's always nice.  That's all I'll say, though.  I don't want to blow up their spot.  But I saw some familiar faces enjoying themselves over the weekend.  And that's good to see.  What's up, Master Puff?  Hey, how are you? 
[00:23:00]  All right.  Hey, guys.  I think they just pulled where I said I like the back door or something.  Yeah.  I know what you fucking devious bastards are doing.  I see Danny.  First, I saw right when I said it, I saw Derek look up at the monitor trying to get some kind of time code.  And then Danny comes running in to just reinforce, remember to get it.  He said he loves the back door.  I think he said the back door action.  Didn't he say the back door?  Yeah, back door access.  Or action, something like that.  That'll show up.  Oh, yeah.  They're nodding.  Sick Steve promo.  That's what they do.  Vultures.  Fucking word vultures.  What's up, Po? 
[00:23:30]  How are you doing?  I didn't know you were showing up.  No one told me they were showing up.  No one knows when Po's showing up, dude.  You just get your ass kicked and like the wind, he disappears.  Yeah, I wanted to come in like a ninja, but that didn't happen.  Actually, one of you guys has power because they set a table for 16 and that table just sat there for like an hour waiting for either Master Po.  Was it Master Po?  What are you laughing at, Iraq?  Help me out.  Something else?  All right.  Whatever.  But they were all waiting for either Master Po or you to show up.  Yes.  And no one would touch the table. 
[00:24:00]  Don't touch the table yet.  I know.  Well, I was waiting until all the pests and everybody had taken a seat before I came over, but no one was sitting.  Right.  So I took a seat, which was good.  I got the seat I wanted.  Yeah.  Nice cushy bench seat.  Right.  Where you could look over the whole-  The middle of the table.  The whole dining room.  Look at the dining room.  Back to the wall.  I kind of like that.  Right, Po?  Oh, yeah.  You want to have your back to the wall just in case of a frontal attack.  That's right.  You're aware of your surroundings.  How'd you find the silverware?  Good for plunging into someone's throat? 
[00:24:30]  Oh, you had weapons all over the place.  Weapons everywhere.  It was great.  You should see what we got hidden in that place.  Just kidding.  Yeah.  Anything, Paul?  Yeah.  You know, I'm sorry, guys.  I was kind of late.  I don't know, maybe three, four hours late.  Three, four hours late.  Yeah, I was four hours late.  I had everyone meet me at the school, and we were ready to go, and everything was fine. 
[00:25:00]  And then the person I was going with wasn't ready.  So everyone-  So you had to kill him.  Well, no, not him.  Her.  Po, just say the food was great so we can move on.  Oh, let me tell you.  The food was fabulous.  If you want to move on, let me tell you.  Guys, you have to go.  The food was intense.  What are you talking about?  He was four hours late because he stopped to eat somewhere else.  I was waiting for someone to get dressed, and it would take them three hours to get dressed.  You had a girl that was three hours late? 
[00:25:30]  Three hours late.  I couldn't believe it.  It was just driving me crazy, and just waiting, and waiting, and waiting.  And I was starving.  I didn't eat all day because I knew that I was going to that restaurant.  I would have left her.  If she was supposed to be there at 6, by 6.10, I would have been on the road.  Meet me there, sweetie.  Well, I tell you, the appetizers was incredible.  The main dish was fabulous, and the company was intense.  In other words, Po wants to say.  Thank you, Po. 
[00:26:00]  Let's go to Greg.  What's up, Greg?  Greg?  Greg?  Hi, Greg.  It's Craig.  Oh, whatever.  Geez, not close enough, right?  No.  Greg from Jersey.  Listen, I wonder.  Dude, my real name is Greg.  When people call me Craig, I even think close enough.  You just answer.  I just go, yeah, it's me.  Whatever.  Yeah, whatever.  What's up?  Listen, I can only imagine the scene there with Anthony holding court, and I can't help 
[00:26:30]  but wonder, who paid for all this when the bill came?  Ah.  I guess Anthony doesn't want it to be known, but Anthony picked up the check for many,  many listeners on Saturday night.  Anthony was picking up the check for listeners in the dining hall.  I'm buying shots for other listeners at the bar.  It was working out.  That's my thing.  I line up a lot of shots every time I'm there, and just a little cheers.  So that's all the best.  Is this restaurant going to go under with all those free food you're giving away?  We're not giving any free food away.  Free food?  We give you the place to hang out, and we do what we can when we can. 
[00:27:00]  All right, great.  Thanks.  Fun snap.  All right, man.  It was an honor for me to buy dinner for the pests after such a huge victory that they won  over that asshole Pharrell over the weekend.  I'm hearing he's done with the little doggy company?  Apparently, you won't be hearing him there no more.  Are we in a holding pattern right now?  We won't hear him no more.  Are the pests in a holding pattern, or is it over?  I guess they're in a holding pattern. 
[00:27:30]  There's some little firefights and flare-ups going on every so often on Fox radio channel  that he was doing something, or ESPN, or wherever he pops up, the pests are there.  No matter where he is when he takes a phone call, somehow you'll hear Ramon.  But they've completely defeated him.  He sounded defeated, sounded drunk on the air, I guess last night, because they pounded him 
[00:28:00]  all weekend long.  Even though he wasn't on Sirius, wherever he went to do radio, they pounded him.  And last night, they were just almost at the point of feeling sorry for him.  He sounded drunk, sounded beaten, sounded like he was ready to start crying on the air,  and they wouldn't let up.  It was an amazing, amazing thing to watch this whole thing go through, from the cocky Pharrell,  who was buddies with Howard Stern, on Sirius Howard 101, advertising when Howard's going 
[00:28:30]  to be on, kissing ass, sucking dick over there.  Two, three, four, five days later, the broken Pharrell, no longer on Sirius, his website  stripped of any references of Sirius satellite radio and him being on it, gone.  And the only people responsible for that are the pests, the ONA army, who just did not let  up, pounded this guy, pounded this guy, made it impossible for him to do the type of show 
[00:29:00]  that might have been seen as a show that they would have wanted over there.  So, bye-bye.  Goodbye.  Not there anymore.  Oh, well.  Pests, victorious.  So, I was honored to sit and break bread with all of you.  That's it.  Bravo to the pests.  Bravo.  Oh, and the pests are getting smarter and smarter and smarter. 
[00:29:30]  They're very organized.  Very good.  Great job with that.  Mm-hmm.  You know, the guy claiming to be our friend and then did what he did.  We don't have to rehash the whole goddamn thing.  That's what happens.  That's what happens.  It's not, when you say bring it on, when anyone out there says bring it on.  Bring it on with your two listeners, I think it was.  Yeah, we're not kidding around.  It's not a bid.  It's not, whenever anyone gets into a little tiff with us and says bring it on with your  two listeners, that's what you're going to get.  You're going to get a non-stop, relentless assault by these fucking pests, these bastards 
[00:30:00]  that don't know how to stop.  And don't quit until you will cry.  You will run to a boss.  You'll do anything aside from sitting there and taking it as some guy who said bring it  on.  Right.  You'll try everything else to stop them from doing what they do.  Well, the worst is when you think you have a real call, and then at the end you hear 
[00:30:30]  grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Right.  Frederica Bimmel's calling in.  Freddie Bimmel.  Freddie Bimmel.  The male version called it Freddie Bimmel.  Because it's D-D-I-E.  Of course it is.  He doesn't know that.  And we just need the pest to continue to be smart and know when to back off.  You know what I mean?  We got to be really, really smart about how we proceed with some of this stuff.  Are you saying that a 1,300 person mob could be a problem sooner or later?  I think so.  But I do think they're getting smarter. 
[00:31:00]  You know, there is a point, and it's really up to you guys.  You got to know when to just back off, know that it's done until the next battle.  Yeah.  Even if it's with the same person.  That's all I'm saying.  I'm not telling these guys, you know, what to do.  But I just want them to know they just got to continue to be smart and, you know, with  what they're doing.  That's all.  Fucking Pharrell got everything he deserved.  Because they got some crazy power.  They really do.  But they got to be smart with it.  And more.  And he's not on Sirius anymore, so they can do whatever the fuck they want. 
[00:31:30]  So job well done.  Let's go to Pat from Menachie.  Pat, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  What's up, Pat?  Now my dog starts barking.  That ass.  Shut up!  Oh, not you.  Hey.  Hey, what's going on with your trailer?  I hear we have money for you.  Yeah, there's like a little pool going there.  No, we got some really good money that we collected.  We collected, or the listeners collected for you, and now we're just trying to figure out  what to do with the money, I guess?  Because you said to, I think, Steve, that you don't want us to hand the money off to 
[00:32:00]  you, because why?  Well, I just didn't want to take the charity, but to avoid scandal, I guess I have to take  it.  I hear if you, Steve's coming in to help me out, that's why I'm waiting here.  Actually, Steve knows the story, so I'll let Steve tell it on the air here.  Steve.  We had a collection after, uh, after the...  I want to see you being made to dance to that with, like, a big ring through your nose and 
[00:32:30]  being traipsed around on your back feet while tourists.  You can ask for that in one hand and take a shit in the other one and see which one gets  filled first.  Point well taken.  Ger, ger.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Ger, ger.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:33:00]  Ger, ger.  Just talk, don't stop.  No, they won't.  What's up, Steve?  Hi.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Shortly after, uh, putting up the Pat from Unaki Cribs episode, uh, there was such a, uh,  I guess, I guess Jeff felt really bad for Pat because he saw how bad he was, um, the conditions  were that he was living.  So we put up a, a donation, a, a PayPal donation, uh, page and the, the fans really, really came  through and they donated over 2,200, I think so far to, to, for the cause to, I guess, help 
[00:33:30]  Pat rebuild his trailer.  And it's, it's sitting here.  I think the check is coming this week and we've got some contractors that are lining up  to offer to help and it will be like sort of an extreme trailer makeover for Pat from  Unaki.  And, uh, we're just, um, and Pat did insist that we not give him the money directly.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, because he, that out of pride?  Well, no, he said he would waste it on, uh, getting his van fixed or something.  Yeah, I guess he's got some van repairs. 
[00:34:00]  What's the matter, Pat?  You don't believe in buying new things?  Why don't you save up and get a new trailer?  Uh, yeah.  He's got to make money to do that.  Yeah, yeah, that's right.  He's got, he's got to make money to do that.  All right.  How much is a new trailer?  Uh, the new trailer is only $50,000.  Good luck to you.  Only?  Only, huh?  I'll hold my breath.  Hey, uh, Pat, so where are we at with the, uh, green hard-boiled eating contest?  I'll bring my stomach. 
[00:34:30]  All right.  But how should we do it?  Uh, you could do it, uh, like the, the, uh, one a minute or just a big bowl of hard-boiled  eggs and start chopping away.  Maybe we should get the guys in the lab to test it out before we, uh, bring it to the  Hard Rock Cafe, St. Paddy's Day, Ant.  I'd be glad to be a test subject.  Oh, by the way, I had to...  No, I mean, some of the interns here or Bill.  Would Bill do it, you think?  Intern Bill?  Uh, he would do just about anything.  Yeah, but I want to see, you know, how it works.  Can he eat one hard-boiled egg every minute until he pukes? 
[00:35:00]  How many would that be?  How long would the contest last?  You think he'd puke?  And then we need contestants to take on Pat.  He seems unpukeable.  Speaking of eating, I had the Bistro Burger at F.H. Reilly's.  Yeah.  Spectacular.  By the way, I got pictures of everybody from my penis cam that were getting up on the Open  Anthony, uh, website.  Yes, dick cam.  Uh, yeah, that's how I take pictures at F.H. Reilly's.  I got some about your dick.  I got some very, very strange angles of, uh, well-known people from this program. 
[00:35:30]  I met a bunch of pal-talkers, uh, Lucci, the lovely Lucci, uh, yeah, she's famous.  She's one of the famous ones where people are going up to her going, wow, you're famous.  Can I have your picture?  Lucci was there?  See?  Exactly.  Everyone knows Lucci.  There she is right there.  Did she show her bosoms?  Uh, I don't think so.  Not at the restaurant.  Do they look heavy in that shirt?  Sometimes.  It's a family restaurant.  Ooh.  Thank you, Pat, for that.  What family wouldn't bond over those fantastic breasts, huh?  You feel weird yelling across the room, hey, tax cunts. 
[00:36:00]  You gotta get people's real names.  Yeah, but the problem is no one knows anyone's real name.  No one knows anyone's real name.  I know.  They talk to each other.  Well, they have whack-bag names and pal-talk names.  You get, uh, confused.  Actually, I think it was tax cunts he, uh, had a post on whackbag.com about the restaurant.  It's like, hey, it's tax cunts.  Can you tell Heather, the, uh, the hostess that she did an unbelievable job?  I want to make sure she, she gets props because it was a very busy night and she,  she took care of us.  And I'm like, now I have to call her up and go, uh, there's a guy, uh, that you served. 
[00:36:30]  His name is, uh, tax cunts.  And he said you did a great job.  Tax cunts loves you.  Right.  They don't understand.  They're just, they're just really good workers and they don't understand that it's normal for  somebody to be sitting there with a name like tax cunts.  They, they're far removed from this show.  Some of those people.  So she, she didn't believe Munaki was a, was a place.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  All right, Pat.  Neither do I.  We'll figure it.  So what are we going to do with the money?  We got it, Pat.  You got to take the fucking money.  You got to use it.  It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, Pat, it's yours for the taking.  I will absolutely hand you over the cashier's check for all of the, the, the donations.  It's coming this week.  Well, if I have to.  Let's give it to the contractor.  That's staying.  Well, we can't.  I mean, it's just, you know, fucking with you.  I would assume.  Or his diabetic toe being cut off.  Pat knows what's got to get done to his, his, his trailer more than anybody.  So we all looked at, we all looked at the video of his trailer on, uh, on your website, 
[00:37:30]  Steve.  Yeah.  And the problem is if you hand over the money to Pat, it's not going to go to repairs.  No.  Or he would have repaired some of that.  It'll go to heroin and cocaine.  Oh, I wish.  So we'll put out a, we'll put out the word for contractors that want to donate their  services.  He'll buy a bunch of little, uh, little foam prosthetic toes to put in his socks to balance  him out when he walks.  See, I think the problem is a contractor isn't even an issue here.  The thing is so far gone.  The trailer, I don't think I, it should be condemned. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, when the subflooring's fucked up, it's like, yeah, this is not.  It's going to rip everything out to the, the, the steel frame.  Yeah.  And, and I don't think, you know, a couple of grand is going to get a contractor in there to  do anything.  Yeah.  Anthony knows, but you can take the money and do something good to improve your life  in some fashion.  Yeah.  Understood.  If you pay me, I'll hang out with you and talk to you.  Oh, well worth the money.  All right, Pat, we're going to figure this out this week. 
[00:38:30]  Okay.  Oh, wonderful.  Maybe later this week you come in and we'll have a contractor.  We'll hand the money right over to him.  How's your credit?  Let's see what happens.  Uh, my credit, uh, concern that a quarter of a million dollar, uh, hospital bill from  hacking off my toe.  Uh, not good.  That was 250 G's.  Yeah.  I had to go in for, uh, like antibiotic treatment for like a couple of months.  Do you have insurance?  No.  No. 
[00:39:00]  No.  So, all right.  So his credit's shot.  So he can't even use it as like a down payment to get a new trailer.  Why not?  You only owe a quarter million in medical expenses.  It's not that bad.  Nothing.  Dropping the bucket.  Are you ever going to pay that off or no?  Get a bag of shows.  That's not getting paid off.  No, that's not getting paid off.  You know who pays that?  Us.  Get a bag of toes.  We do through our, uh, uh, insurance premiums.  It's fine.  I'd rather pay for that than fucking welfare.  I'd rather pay for someone's medical expense.  Someone's little toe.  That's fine.  All right, Pat.  That's an expensive goddamn toe. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, continued good luck to you.  People are saying I gotta go.  Continued good luck to Pat from Menaki.  Thank you.  Jesus, Pat.  Next time you go to F.H. Riley's, fucking dinner's on me.  Oh, my God, man.  All right, thanks, Pat.  It wasn't this time you didn't buy Pat dinner?  Somebody.  Who bought you dinner, Pat?  A bunch of people bought me drinks when I walked in the place.  Yeah.  He wasn't sitting at my table, so I wasn't able to hook him up.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's all right.  Anthony, make sure I sat with all slender people. 
[00:40:00]  No, Ant doesn't, he doesn't give a shit about spending money.  No, I know.  I got it, and I went with it.  Me a bag of shells.  Easy come.  Easy go.  All right, Pat.  She ain't a bad old crone at that.  Let's go to Bill in Boston.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  I love Sponge talking mad shit about you guys on Friday.  Saying that your company's sinking like the Titanic,  and if you think you're going to work over at Sirius when you're gone, 
[00:40:30]  you're sorely mistaken, and he'll quit if you guys go over to Sirius.  He'll quit?  He'll quit.  Yeah, sure.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  I heard he's threatening to move to 10 a.m.  Yeah.  Well, I want you guys to talk about the financial situation.  All right.  You guys talked about the Sirius stuff.  Why?  Are you a fan of Sirius?  Is that what I'm getting at, Bill?  Here's the deal that he didn't say.  Yeah, he just hung up.  He hung up.  He hung up.  Real brave.  We're willing to have him on the line.  In a nutshell, this is very good. 
[00:41:00]  XM came out with their quarterly earnings report, I guess, a day before Sirius did.  So when they came out, and the news was that XM had spent a lot of money  during the Christmas season on advertising and acquiring talent.  To combat the Howard side.  Right.  And the fact that Howard was about to begin.  Yeah.  That's what you do as a company.  You combat stuff.  Yeah, and they spent a lot of money doing that.  It was known that they were going to do this,  and it was known that that quarter wasn't going to be as good 
[00:41:30]  because they were spending a lot of money.  Then they pull back is what they do.  Money they wouldn't have spent.  No.  But knew they had to.  All of a sudden, Sirius, now some of the personalities on Sirius turned around  and started bashing XM, going, see, oh, they're broke.  It's doom and gloom.  The end is near.  Look at this.  The next day, I guess, Sirius came out with their earnings report,  and it was the exact same situation. 
[00:42:00]  Exact.  They had spent a lot of money on advertising for the Christmas season  and to push Howard, and they lost a lot of money.  They posted a huge loss.  Did they, by the way, talk about that at all?  No.  Did they talk about that?  No.  They didn't mention it.  No.  We're mentioning it.  Yeah, XM took a bigger loss because they spent a lot of money during that quarter.  Sirius took a huge loss because they spent a lot of money.  It's the same situation. 
[00:42:30]  Where's this guy from Boston?  Yeah, where are you?  We would explain it to you.  We would like to explain it and talk to you about it.  Hang up.  But for some reason, I don't see the Sirius personalities getting on and explaining,  well, we had a shitty quarter financially.  XM's still the better company by far.  Absolutely.  Please.  We'll reach positive cash flow before Sirius,  and they're hemorrhaging cash over there,  and they still got that cash cow Howard to pay. 
[00:43:00]  So just stop.  Where are you, Bill?  Where are you?  This is your answer.  Call back.  This is your answer, Bill.  Say whatever you want.  You're not going to get dumped.  He thought he was making a big statement like,  oh, that should scare the boys.  You know what?  He hung up.  Did it scare us, Bill?  He hung up because he thought we were going to be a dump out of them or hang up.  I'll hang up first before they hang up on me.  We're not going to hang up on you.  It's an open forum here.  Talk, idiot.  Dude, I got to say, though,  you don't want to deal with Bubba, man.  I don't want to battle that guy.  He's...  Oh, well.  That guy kicks asses and takes names, 
[00:43:30]  and he talks in a really, really cool voice.  When is he on?  Oh, yeah, during the future Howard Stern shift.  What a bitch, man.  You know?  Almost.  Almost.  Feel bad for the guy.  He signs on, all excited about doing afternoons at Howard Station.  Comes out of his exile with Howard there.  He's going to do afternoons on the same station as Howard Stern.  It's going to be great.  And then Howard goes, you know something?  I'm thinking of doing afternoon drive, too. 
[00:44:00]  I want to replay my morning show and afternoons,  because a lot of my fans say they want to listen to me on the drive home.  Well, once that gets going, bye-bye.  Where do you think Bubba goes?  The midday shift is the big one that everybody kind of wants,  is the 10 a.m. to 2.  Bill.  That's the big one.  I didn't hang up on you guys.  Oh, okay.  Well, we didn't hang up on you.  Yes, you did.  I love you guys.  No, you don't.  I love you guys.  Shut up, you do not.  Bill.  You just like us a lot. 
[00:44:30]  Bill, you're lying, though,  because I know the difference when the listener hangs up or we hang up.  You hung up.  I swear to God, I would never hang up on you.  Did you get all the answers?  Did you get all the answers?  I was just so, when they're talking shit about you,  I know what's going on,  because you guys are talking shit.  The media is blowing.  I love you guys.  F, F, Siri.  Oh, my God, I don't love you.  I love Bill.  Oh, come on.  Now I've got to hang up on you.  Don't hang up on Bill, sweetie.  I don't like you, Bill.  I think you're lying.  I swear to God, I can prove to you.  What do you want me to do? 
[00:45:00]  All right, I believe him.  Jump off that bridge there.  I will.  I'm on the Tobin right now, heading into RKO.  All right, if you love us so much,  just veer to the right.  All right.  Not even veer.  Just turn really hard, right into the guardrail.  We're waiting.  You're the best.  Yeah, I got it, man.  And one of the board of directors quit,  so they're blowing that out of proportion.  The media is.  XM, trust me, is just fine.  Yeah, there's some guy on the board of directors. 
[00:45:30]  He was on the board of directors,  and he decided that a good strategy for the company  is to go into this holding pattern  where you don't spend any more money.  To try to acquire new subscribers,  to try to acquire name talent,  things like that, important things.  To keep the company growing.  The company has been growing.  They have a plan,  and they're right on schedule and target  with this plan.  And this guy decides,  no, we should freeze everything,  and he was in disagreement with the rest of the board 
[00:46:00]  who thinks that the company's doing fine the way it's going  and should continue its growth the way it has been.  And he had a problem,  quits,  and then starts bad-mouthing the United States of America.  Starts bad-mouthing XM Satellite Radio,  saying a crisis is in the future.  A crisis is in his future.  Go away.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  I think the company's doing just fine  with their strategy. 
[00:46:30]  Trust me,  XM's just fine.  We can't play all our cards here.  Just give it a couple months,  and you'll see exactly...  Don't worry.  ...what we see.  The company is just fine.  But you won't hear Sirius talk about their shitty quarter.  Matt from Yonkers,  what's up?  You guys wanted to say that the other day  Howard Stern said on his show  that Bubba the Love Sponge  is going to get more listeners to Sirius  than Oprah's going to get for XM.  You know...  Where do they... 
[00:47:00]  I guess it's more Howie math.  More Howie math.  There are more people pulling Howie math  out of their asses.  Good old Howie math.  They got a picture of Howie in the...  What is it?  The Post?  Staggering out of some fucking restaurant  with his chick.  He looks hammered.  Maybe he was doing his Howie math  at the restaurant on Friday or Saturday night.  Howie math.  Good old Howie math.  Lover or hater,  Oprah's going to bring a lot of people  to Satellite Radio. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  A lot of people.  You know, not our demo.  It's going to be more the female demo.  It's what XM Satellite Radio's all about, though.  The diversity, Opie.  Although we do have a lot more female listeners  with this version of the show  than past Opie and Anthony shows.  Let's go to Jim in New York.  Jim?  Good morning, boys.  How are you?  Good.  Listen, I wasn't one of the ones that got it,  but we had a bunch of people last night  that were getting phone calls  from a quote-unquote serious lawyer.  Yeah.  Saying that if you don't cut it out,  we're going to take legal action. 
[00:48:00]  First of all, it's bullshit.  You wouldn't be getting phone calls.  Oh, I know that.  They don't make phone calls.  It wouldn't be on a Sunday night either.  What I think it was was a screener  that kept all the numbers,  and once Pharrell got fired,  decided, oh, wow, I don't have a job,  so let me make some phone calls.  I wouldn't worry.  Well, yeah, a screener probably has the caller ID,  so they've gotten a couple of the numbers  of the people that were really huge pests  and what they're calling them,  trying to scare them.  Lawyers don't make phone calls. 
[00:48:30]  They send legal letters  that are 18 pages long  that you have to go through.  Don't worry about a phone call.  A lawyer called on a Sunday night  and complained that you were calling a talk show.  Yeah, that's going to happen.  Yeah, that's what lawyers do.  That thing where we give the number out,  you're not allowed to call it.  The funny part about it is, you know,  whoever it was...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  What did you say?  Hold on a second, hold on.  Oh, no, no, no.  Wait, no, you said it.  Wait, I didn't hear what you said.  I'm punching out now.  No, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:49:00]  Don't you dare.  Don't you dare.  What's the funny part?  What's the funny part?  Don't you...  Don't you hang the butt us.  I don't believe I...  All right, what's the funny part?  Seriously, what's the funny part?  We're ready.  Oh, no.  I don't want to do this.  Oh, well, I'm going to have to.  What's the funny part?  What's the funny part?  It's okay.  You're amongst friends.  Whoever it was calling at 10 o'clock at night,  that's restricted time.  They can't call after 10 o'clock at night  on a Sunday anyway.  What we're going to have to do is contact Sirius 
[00:49:30]  and let Sirius know about this.  And, you know, whoever it was,  if they weren't fired already,  they're going to be fired now.  And, well, call Crash Me Now  because it's over.  Later, boys.  Oh, my God.  Did he see that coming a mile away?  Well, dude, that was actually, that should have gotten, like, a laugh, though, 
[00:50:00]  because, like, you talk about, like, the lawyers, right?  And they're like, what happened?  When did they call?  During restricted time.  Ah, it's restricted time.  That was the funny part of his story, though.  I never heard a guy stuck within a sentence before like that.  He was done.  He just couldn't finish his sentence.  Burt.  Where's the period?  Let's go to Mike in Philly.  Mike.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'm a big fan from back in your days and that.  We don't care.  No one cares.  Just get to the point. 
[00:50:30]  I care.  Anthony's exactly right about the advertising.  I'm a cheap CPA.  Yeah.  And I liked you guys, but still didn't sign on.  Walking through the mall, Christmas time, signed up at the kiosk.  Oh, thank you.  So, you're welcome.  I'm enjoying the show.  No, but, Mike, you were saying I think you're right about the XM finances.  Right.  That's all you want to say?  Right.  Yeah, I'm a CPA, and I'm actually a big investor, too.  Oh, okay.  Personally.  All right.  You're exactly right.  Oh, you're disclosing that.  Cash flow. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Everything's looking good, but I'm just a perfect example of how the advertising stared me in.  All right.  I'd love to buy, but I'm so scared of getting in trouble.  Why?  I don't know who to talk to.  I talk to Elo, and I say, what's going on?  And when he tells me, I buy stock.  Is that bad?  Yeah.  All right.  Who do I talk to?  Thank you.  If I wanted to buy XM stock.  I want to buy XM stock so bad.  I used to trade it like bubblegum cards before I was an employee.  I don't know if we're allowed to.  I don't know if we have to talk to somebody.  We obviously have to talk to somebody, because at times we are privy to things. 
[00:51:30]  Right.  Not really, though.  No, enough.  There's enough where it could be, you know.  It's always like this gray thing that hovers around us.  Gray is better than black area.  You know what I mean?  Something might be coming, or it might not.  We're in a position where we probably should do things completely by the book.  Yeah.  So if I want to buy stock, like I would buy stock today.  I want to buy stock, but I can't. 
[00:52:00]  I have to go and talk to somebody and make sure I disclose what I'm buying and how many  shares.  Trust me.  Buy.  Buy.  Buy.  Buy.  Buy.  Trust me on this.  Buy.  Buy.  Buy.  You keep saying that.  Buy will be B-Y-E-B-Y-E.  Or B-I.  B-I.  Hey, with an F in front of it.  We don't know.  I can't.  Wait. 
[00:52:30]  Oh.  Hey.  That's a good one.  That's pretty funny, actually.  Okay, I'll take that back.  Oh, right.  Damn, I crashed twice.  Hey, could they turn the fucking heat down in here?  Jesus, it's brutal.  Now it's hot in here.  You know what you should do?  You should get the car crash.  We have it.  Backwards?  Backwards.  Where you could take it?  Than, where's my backwards car crash?  I would love it next to the car crash.  That's for the rare occasion when you car crash somebody and it wasn't deserved, you could  take it back, right?  Yeah.  All right, Than is finding it.  Yeah, we have car crash on every single template here. 
[00:53:00]  Right.  So it's very difficult.  Very easy to get the car crash.  Very difficult to get the backwards car crash.  Than's searching, but no.  Oh, no.  Now the moment's passed and it's...  Come on, Nathaniel.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, where is it?  It's not assigned to anything.  Okay.  That's pretty cool.  Oh, I'm safe.  See, it works out in the end.  All right, we should take a break.  It's not assigned to anything, is it?  No.  Neither will you be. 
[00:53:30]  No.  We should take a break.  Anthony?  Yes, sir.  I'm proud to say this is my first time doing my brand new bit.  It's the Opie Penis Cam.  Ooh.  And my picture's from FH Riley's.  Yes.  400 New York Avenue, my brother's fine restaurant in the heart of Huntington.  The pictures from the penis cam are up.  See if I got you from the penis cam.  You've decided to hold your camera where your penis is. 
[00:54:00]  Yes.  And snap photos of people from that precarious angle.  I even got a picture of Anthony at his table.  Yes, there I am.  What a great shot that is.  I hope he's yawning.  That'll be good.  I'm staring intently at the camera drooling.  The best part of the penis cam, some people look at the camera.  Look at it.  And some don't.  Yeah, I wasn't looking at the camera.  Thank God.  But they're up on opiananthony.com.  You got my brother Elmo.  You got some dude that decided he needed to have a wow tattoo on his arm. 
[00:54:30]  He was there.  I don't know his name.  You got Master Poe and E-Rock and Pat from Menaki and Big A and Bam made it.  Who else?  Drew Boogie.  I forgot Drew Boogie was there.  Drew was there.  No filter Paul.  No filter Paul and his drunk wife Denise made the penis cam.  So check it out for yourself.  Fish, my brother-in-law who does the bartending at FH Riley.  So go to opiananthony.com to check that out.  Anthony?  Yes.  I have an announcement.  I don't know if we should do this, but what the hell we are going to do this. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, no.  Whenever it starts like that, we usually get fired.  I don't know if we should do this.  I have an idea.  This is not going to be an official Opie and Anthony show event.  But if you want to come by, you're more than welcome.  Two weeks from this past Saturday, ONA, Pest, Late Night, Karaoke at FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Karaoke, huh?  With the Pest. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, because you guys are doing it on the Pal Talks.  I figured it's worth doing in the restaurant.  But it'll be late night.  It'll start like 11, 1130.  So it'll be the first ONA, Pest, Karaoke, Late Night thing.  What's the date?  Two weeks from this past Saturday.  Would you go, Jimmy?  If I'm around, it's March 4th.  I might be in town, actually.  Yeah.  And here's the other thing, because we're not really sure about this one yet, because we're  still trying to work the shit out.  But maybe someone could bring a laptop and hook up a Pal Talk camera, and we'll kind of 
[00:56:00]  broadcast it on Pal Talk.  Put it on Pal Talk so people that can't make it can join in the festivities and laugh along  with everybody.  Yeah, so the rest of the country could check it out.  I think any event we do outside the studio these days, we're going to have the Pal Talk cameras  with us.  Yeah, when we do the St. Paddy's Day broadcast at the Hard Rock, we'll have a lot of Pal Talk  cameras set up for the rest of the country, but we'll try it at FH Riley's.  We just need someone with a laptop that just takes that on and helps us out, because we  don't have time to do that right now.  No.  All right?  So two weeks from this coming Saturday. 
[00:56:30]  Very good at FH Riley's, my brother's fine restaurant.  We should take a break, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program.  I see Foot is outside.  Footy?  With some dude from the band Alabama, I think.  Wow.  That's going back quite a few years.  Frank Bush.  Frank lives down there.  Oh, I thought you meant that.  Virginia?  Oh, I thought you meant the haircut.  Yeah.  And footy.  Yeah, we'll get a foot in.  That guy was in every single 70s band. 
[00:57:00]  Fog hat.  Playing the bass.  Playing the bass.  He's the bass player from every 70s rock slash country band.  All right, we've got to talk about Daytona 500, I guess, and my new favorite sport next.  Ugh.  You won't believe this. 
[00:57:30]  Congratulations to Jimmy Johnson for winning Daytona.  Did you check out any of the race, Anthony?  Uh, no, I didn't.  I don't know shit about NASCAR, but...  Ben checked it out.  I've got to tell you, it's a lot of fun to watch.  We're not going to fake it.  We're not huge NASCAR fans.  My brother was teaching me some stuff for a while, which made it much more interesting 
[00:58:00]  to watch, but I forgot everything he told me, so now I'm back to just a casual observer  of the whole thing.  Yeah, Ben watched it, said it was great.  He said on high def.  On high def.  Everything is better in high def.  And Jimmy Johnson was on our show, and two, three days later, he wins Daytona 500.  That's kind of cool.  Yes.  And he was really nice on our program.  And he's doing a show on the NASCAR channel, but I don't have the details in front of me,  so sorry about that.  You know, maybe you could check out the old XM guide or whatever they have. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  I don't know half the shit that's on XM when we're not broadcasting.  I have my limited channels I listen to.  But I think we're missing out on some big opportunities, some really cool stuff that  is happening on XM that we could kind of exploit and have fun with.  Yeah.  You know, but I don't know.  I don't know, though.  I just don't know.  All right.  I'm done.  What's wrong, Anthony?  I was a little distracted.  Well, apparently there's no admins, you know, people to bounce people out of the PalTalk 
[00:59:00]  room.  And see, you know what's going on on PalTalk?  There's two things going on so far.  O&A pests getting together, having fun, watching the show, and Arab men jerking off.  You're lying.  Seems to be what people like to do.  So boot those pests out.  Oh, stop.  I'm working on a new laugh.  Was that good?  Not good, huh?  All right.  I'll try a couple more today.  No.  I didn't hear it.  No, you heard it.  I didn't. 
[00:59:30]  Listen on the replay.  All right.  They just enjoy sitting in front of a camera.  Regardless of what's going on in a room, they zoom the camera in on their crotch and start  jacking off like fucking monkeys.  Savages.  It's called looking for Osama.  Is that what they call it?  Looking for Osama?  Well, they get bounced.  All right, Jamie.  I thought there was something there, kind of.  Oh, the search is on, and the penises are a disaster to begin with. 
[01:00:00]  Please stop.  All right.  Well, no, I'm not sure what you mean.  It was like, I'm not sure what you mean.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Now I know to shut up.  Do you wear the Breathe Right all the time now?  Dude, I might assign this to it.  Is it all the time?  I need to get surgery.  Do you sleep with them?  Yeah, I have to.  I don't shower in the morning.  I shower when I get home.  You don't need surgery.  You do your act with them on?  No, no, no, no.  That would be wacky.  Yeah.  Hey, look at this.  I'm having a bad nose day.  I certainly don't. 
[01:00:30]  You don't need surgery.  You should put a little arrow on it.  It looks like there's an arrow through your nose.  Yeah, and then I can do being there if I can steal something else from Peter Sellers.  That shit bag.  You're a hypochondriac.  You don't need surgery.  There's a book out right now.  It's called Hypochondriac for Dummies or something like that.  Maybe someone can help me out with the exact title of the book, but supposedly it's for  people like Jimmy that always have something going on.  Dude, I have a deviated septum.  I've had it looked at. 
[01:01:00]  I've had cameras put up my nose.  I have to have, I can't breathe because my sinuses have to be fixed.  Believe me, their needs fixed.  Are they like your ear canals, just little tiny things?  Huh?  But you were breathing for many, many years until you realized you can't breathe.  Horribly.  My whole life, my entire life has been awful.  Sniffling and blood.  I always had like an awful booger tissue.  Always.  Yeah.  My sinus has been a problem, so I was a little lad.  Yeah.  A little lamb.  So I want to get it fixed.  I'm going to get it fixed soon.  Are you?  You're going to need a lot of time, right? 
[01:01:30]  Not that much.  Like that's going to be one of your vacations in the hospital, getting your nose cracked open?  No, you get it fixed.  You go home the same day.  They plug you up for like three days.  It's a bad three days.  My father had it done.  A lot of my uncles were all, it'd be all the fucking awful snow.  Gotta pack your nose.  Yeah.  They pack it with gauze.  But it makes you breathe a lot better.  It opens you up, man.  It changes your life.  What if you sound all different and people aren't getting that familiar Jimmy Norton voice?  Yeah?  Get used to it, shitheads.  I'm not going to fucking die of sleep apnea so you can have your fucking, your ear candy.  So the pal talk room's all set now, Anthony? 
[01:02:00]  Yes, yes.  I finally figured out how to make some people, give them some authority.  I'm delegating responsibility.  I'm making people deputies.  All right.  So now they can bounce out the jack-offing Arabs.  All right.  And we're done with our NASCAR talk.  I think we did a pretty good job with that today.  I think we did way too much, actually.  We didn't even tune out.  I think we sounded very well-informed on that topic, so we should be proud of ourselves.  Yes.  The NASCAR conversation was great. 
[01:02:30]  I have a question for you, man.  I want to get this, because I know that, you know, K-Fed is in the news.  And that guy is just-  K-Fed, yeah.  That guy's terrific.  I like him stuff a lot.  Britney's husband.  Oh, yeah.  He's good, man.  Kevin Federline's like my favorite new artist.  Oh, one of the best.  I just wanted to know if we had his song.  Oh, yeah.  We have his song.  We played it.  Oh, okay.  Did we get it?  Maybe just going to break or something, because the guy just grooves, man.  He's just so good.  He did not write, I'm da bomb.  Oh, I hope he did.  Is it D-A bomb?  D-A.  I'm da bomb.  Yeah.  Kevin Federline must already know his rap album is going to bomb. 
[01:03:00]  He compares its release to the devastation of war.  What?  A quote, sure, there'll be the initial shock and awe, K-Fed says in this week's Newsweek,  but they've already said so much shit about me, it can't get worse.  Yes, it can.  Shock and awe?  Britney Spears is his husband's first single, the dance track, Bobo Zau, or Bobo Zau.  Papa Zau or something like that.  Papa Zau.  Papa Zau.  Which means big ass in Brazilian slang was ridiculed, yet garnered his website. 
[01:03:30]  Two million hits within a week?  Wow.  Two million people checked it out to see how bad it was?  Federline still believes people are laughing with him.  What a douche.  No.  If my album has even half that attention, watch out, he tells the magazine.  Hated or love it, the album which he plans to release this spring with or without a record deal,  will probably receive more than its fair share of attention.  But don't expect any duets with Spears on the upcoming release.  Former backup dancer turned rapper Federline wants people to love him for who he is, not who he's married to.  Yeah, a wigger.  We have collaborated, but I'm not going to put the songs on this album because it's like, 
[01:04:00]  respect me first, then I'll show you what I've done with my wife.  This is good.  Respect me first.  The guy is known for marrying Britney Spears.  That's it.  Yep.  I can't even tell, though, if this is good or bad rap.  It sounds like hack rap.  Like it sounds like other people that have done rap to me.  I don't fucking know. 
[01:04:30]  This is just every bit of loud music that's coming out of a fucking Celica that's behind me in a light.  Shut the fuck up.  I hope your lug nuts rattle off of your wheels and at 60 they come flying off.  Dude, you don't want to toy with K-Fed.  I know.  I don't want to start a war with him.  No, sir.  This guy's good.  Is this good?  That's fantastic.  And why?  If it's not, why?  He sounds like Eminem.  Discuss.  Has a little Snoop Dogg to him and somebody else in there. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, he's trying to do an Eminem thing, I think.  I hear it in his voice.  What does that mean?  He's big ass in Brazil.  He's dangerous.  It's got like a raghead feel to it.  This is, I find it repulsive and horrible, but who the fuck?  I don't know.  It's a bit on the catchy side.  Stop it. 
[01:05:30]  It could be.  It's what you call a K-Fed toe tapper.  Enough with the K-Fed.  Tap a toe into his wife's stomach.  A bit of his offspring.  All right, we discussed K-Fed.  I kicked the crib.  We're doing really good today as far as mainstream stuff.  Yep.  All popular culture stuff.  Hey, I have to admit this.  I have to.  It's all about curling in the Winter Olympics.  Remember we made fun of it?  Hey, remember? 
[01:06:00]  Remember when we all made fun of it?  And it's different now?  No, it's not.  I'm still making fun of it.  I don't need anyone to jump on the bandwagon in this room.  I'm just saying I went from making fun of curling to I'm obsessed with the goddamn thing.  Now you're watching it as a fan of the sport.  On a Saturday or a Sunday, on an awful winter day like we had, it's the best thing to just  sit around and watch curling.  There's strategy involved.  Which rock are they going to take out?  Is it true you've already called ELO for curling box seats tickets in Canada? 
[01:06:30]  Well, they have a new curling channel starting.  I'm telling you right now, I don't know what it is.  Someone help me out maybe.  If you don't want to help me out, that's fine too, but I can't get enough of the curling.  Really?  And the chicks that throw the rock, they're the hottest little things.  Yeah.  Every single one of them.  And then they got their fat assistants that run down the ice and sweep the rock, the ice  for the rock or the stone or whatever the hell they call it.  We've all seen how it works.  The teapot, whatever it is.  Is that what they call it?  See, now, do you know the lingo and everything now? 
[01:07:00]  I think it's called a stone.  A stone?  But I don't know.  Well, in the early days, it was probably an actual stone, I bet.  But I don't know.  The one you throw is different than the stone.  Wait.  No, they're all stones, I guess.  But the one, I don't know.  The one with the handle?  The one that looks like a teapot.  Right.  Maybe, I think it's called something as it's going down the ice.  I don't know.  Boring.  Huh?  Yeah, boring.  No, we got some great audio.  Oh, great audio of some curling.  The Swedish curling team.  Now, what Cassie will have to do is she'll have to run it back and hope that she takes 
[01:07:30]  that one off the button and rolls the one that she raised out of the rings.  HÃ¥kje?  HÃ¥kje, mitts mellam.  HÃ¥kje, mitts mellam.  HÃ¥kje?  There is as much pressure on placing this guard squarely where it should be as there  is for a draw to the button.  This is going to be a little closer.  Closer, the better for the U.S. team. 
[01:08:00]  That's what I'm thinking.  You hear the sweeping?  That is not quite on the 12-foot.  That's the sound of wrist cutting.  Much closer than the last run-back attempt that Cassie had.  There's something called guards.  Guards.  Yeah, you throw them a little short before the big bullseye thing.  Uh-huh.  And the middle bullseye, I think, is called the button.  The button.  But if you start out by throwing some guards, basically, they're a little short and just  makes it a nightmare.  Really?  So there's some blocking strategy involved.  Oh, it all starts with a blocking strategy. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  And they play, like, ten innings or something.  Ten ends.  It's called ends, Anthony.  Ends?  There's ten ends.  And ends are like innings, basically.  I can't...  How did you get sucked into this?  I...  You watched it for a few minutes and was like, hey, hey, hey.  I crashed my brother's house and we were just laying around.  A little curling.  Watching curling and Cassie for the United States doing her thing.  He knows the names of the people.  Cassie?  Cassie.  I guarantee I could find ten people that know Cassie already.  Ten people out of the whole Olympics. 
[01:09:00]  She's just an overnight sensation.  No, she was all over the TV all weekend long.  Yeah, big star.  She's beautiful.  Is she the blonde?  She's the blonde.  Is she the one that pushes the thing?  She pushes the teapot.  Yeah.  But there's a Russian chick that's blonde that looks hot.  She looks like she should be stripping.  She's really hot, too, yes.  Yes.  Actually, yes.  Is she...  In the latest issue of Playboy, they show her kind of covering her boobs.  Do we have this sexy for you?  I throw the rock and then I dance for the $20.  She's so hot she has, like, a calendar or something. 
[01:09:30]  Or the Russian curlers have a calendar.  They're so hot.  They do?  Or all the curling girls have a calendar.  Well, the blonde Russian chick's pretty hot.  She's really hot.  I don't know if we have that Playboy in the office still.  Ben's looking right now.  The girls of curling doesn't sound like something I want to really, you know...  No.  Not a real page-turner.  No.  If you see one, you know you better stick with it, because when you turn the page...  All right, here we go.  Look at this.  Chris in Jersey.  Chris, what's up?  Oh, but I just wanted to back you up about curling, man.  It's a shit right now.  So, where are you from?  Wait, is that her? 
[01:10:00]  Oh, there it is.  That's the Russian brush.  Holy smokes.  Get that on opientthony.com.  You laugh at me now.  Yes.  She's hot, though.  She's hot.  Yeah, but you could just sit around and watch her.  I could care less if she plays fucking ping pong.  I picked her.  I don't care what she does.  You don't want to watch her?  I'm not saying, wow, curling's a great sport now.  I'm saying that chick is half naked.  She's hot.  I want to watch her compete in a low-drinking contest.  When are you going to get Pete Fenton on a calendar?  Well, he actually wouldn't come on the show.  Who's that? 
[01:10:30]  Who's Pete Fenton?  The U.S. men's skip.  The men's skip.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Why do I ask you?  No, you faked that.  He wouldn't come on the show.  I want to call Jimmy out every time he does this.  What?  It actually sounded like he knew who that guy was talking about.  You did not.  The guy from the...  Jimmy is an idiot and knows nothing.  No, I was right with you, fella.  Let's go to big bag.  Big bag.  Big bag.  I just want to tell you, it may be gay, but I love that damn sport.  I don't know why. 
[01:11:00]  There's something about it.  You answered your own question.  No, when you watch for a little while, you start realizing all the strategy, and it's  kind of cool.  It's kind of cool.  I like playing that shuffleboard in the bars.  By the way.  Is that similar?  Yeah, pretty much.  Where you used to put those cheese shaker, and you get the stuff on the board,  and then you got to lag it in there?  You know when they're sweeping to make the ice smoother so the stone goes further?  Oh, the most exciting part of curling, yes.  You know you can make the stone go 12 to 15 feet further, depending on how well you do 
[01:11:30]  the sweeping?  Really?  Because sometimes they just sweep a little, but if they really need to get some action  going, they can get that stone.  Is it just that you're melting a little bit of the ice, leaving a slight layer of water,  or is it that you're making it shinier, almost buffing the ice?  I'll get back to that.  And it slides up.  Professor Anthony, they put down pebbles on the ice, little mounds of ice that they spray  on, and then you round those out, and it makes it a little bit faster.  So if you want it to slow down, you leave the pebbles alone, and if you want it to speed  up, you get rid of them as quickly as you can, looking like an idiot. 
[01:12:00]  That is correct, Professor Anthony.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  A little knowledge.  I'll tuck that away.  Is there a special broom that they use?  I mean, do they go to Home Depot and head on out, or is there special fibers?  Old school, I've seen real brooms being used.  But nowadays, they're using something that almost looks like a squeegee.  Opie, explain.  Now that you're up.  I, uh, I, uh.  Nothing.  Right.  There's hot chicks, though.  Use a leaf blower. 
[01:12:30]  Honestly.  Now that, just future it up a little bit.  Exactly.  Honestly, the Olympics was on, and Kathy just has a nice ass, and we couldn't turn the channel.  I say nobody gets to stand on the ice, and they just set a bunch of Roombas loose.  Wouldn't that be good to watch?  The little robotic vacuum cleaners?  I wouldn't mind curling if they were pushing someone in a quadriplegic sideways in his wheelchair.  Oh.  Mike from New York City.  I want to watch curling if it's just Terry Schiavo's legs and what they're doing.  Do they have a Mexican curling team?  Does Mexico have a curling team? 
[01:13:00]  You have day laborers sweeping and something going down?  Putting down wood shavings and cleaning them up?  The funny thing about curling, they got the hot chick that throws the initial stone, whatever  it's called, and then the chubby girls have to run down the ice to get the exercise and  do all the sweeping.  But why are the chubby girls doing the work?  I guess.  Seems like they would kind of work out.  Because they got a little more muscle power, I guess.  Oh, all right.  Because they're bigger girls.  They're not fat.  They're just like big muscle-bound mousses from Canada.  They're used to sweeping and cleaning up to make men love them. 
[01:13:30]  Right.  Big fat shows.  They have to do better.  That's right.  The hot chick just bends over and pushes something, and everybody claps.  I bet the best at it is the one with the two blackened eyes.  And the cauliflower ear.  Now clean it up!  Yeah, you're going to kill me.  You're a killer like your father!  Be a silver medalist, just like your father!  Mike from New York City, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Just wanted to say, bravo Sierra on the U.S. team, because they got some Puerto Rican  woman.  The only thing that looks like she's been sweeping for the last 20 years. 
[01:14:00]  You don't know?  Everyone knows?  Not everyone, but no, Cassie, the blonde girl.  Yeah.  Is she the one that knocks before she goes on the ice and goes, housekeeping?  Because I've seen her.  All right.  There's this one, I don't know, named Sanchez or something.  They don't even let her touch the rock.  She just sweeps and does nothing.  Oh, Sanchez?  Shut up, Jimmy!  No, she doesn't do nothing.  You know nothing!  It's Loretta Sanchez.  Loretta Sanchez.  You actually, when you're fucking someone in the ass, if you put your finger in their 
[01:14:30]  ass and rub it under your nose, you get her.  You get her.  She's got to sweep it up, because it's dirty.  John from Jersey, what's up?  Yeah, man.  This freaking chick, Cassie, and her sister, Jamie, they're the hottest freaking two girls.  I can do the same shit.  I got to watch just for that reason, because they're smoking.  Yeah.  Curling has figured out a way to get people to watch by getting hot chicks.  They figured that out?  Anthony, you're one of these strategy-type guys, aren't you?  I think you would enjoy it. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, I'll give it a try.  How about you go home?  Can I get it in high def?  Go home, watch it for like an hour, and then have a full report.  Any curling matches on today?  Are the Olympics still on?  Does anyone know?  I have no idea.  I haven't caught one second of the Olympics.  Look at Iraq on the remote.  Dude.  No.  I've got to admit, I'm getting kind of hooked on the Olympics a little bit, right?  So I'm taking a peek.  Great.  Yeah, it's over in like two days.  I know.  I'm taking a peek here and there.  I love the hockey.  It's all about the hockey. 
[01:15:30]  But then I flip it on, and they had some bobsledding, and then I flip back, and it's  like, it's not even ice skating, it's ice dancing.  Oh, that's a pretty faggy little sport there.  Like I would almost watch ice skating, almost.  Yeah.  But then it was ice dancing.  I'm like, what?  What is this sport?  Curling!  Oh, curling!  The men's.  Calm down.  Why is Eric Logan pushing that fucking...  Fucking curling's on, baby! 
[01:16:00]  Fucking Elo!  Oh my God, it's in the second end.  It's the beginning of the...  He knows.  Holy shit.  I am petrified.  The Canadian guard is on the corner out in front.  See?  See, that's the guard.  Right.  He's got to get it away from there.  Yeah.  But he made it past the guard.  Yep.  But it doesn't...  Now they're really sweeping.  Yeah, sweep!  Sweep!  Get it into the circle.  Oh, that's a good shot.  Wow.  Is this exciting?  Actually, that's a horrible shot, because now they can take both those stones out with  one throw.  One throw.  Two-time Canadian champion in his own right. 
[01:16:30]  Holy shit.  Oh, the Canadians are on, so they've got to be pretty good at this, right?  It's the Canadian men's team.  It's the Canadians and the Americans going at it.  Oh, this is a huge match, Opie.  Throws the last rock.  Holy crap.  Last rock coming up in this end, Anthony.  In this end, of course.  That went without saying.  It's the second end.  That's why I didn't say it.  It's a 10-end tournament.  Look at the technique.  This guy, slow release.  This guy might play conservative, because he let it go.  It's E-Rock. 
[01:17:00]  He let it go.  Oh, he's playing conservative.  He's just going to go for it.  What is he doing?  He's just trying to bump it?  No, he's going for the button.  Why aren't they sweeping, Opie?  Why aren't they sweeping?  He's going conservative.  All he has to do is get it around those guards.  Oh, no.  He is going for it.  Oh, wow.  What a perfect shot.  No.  He's knocked it into the red circle.  I don't know what that one meant.  I don't know what has happened.  What's that mean?  I could care less.  He knocked it into the Indian woman's head.  What does that mean?  I could give a shit.  I have no idea what that just meant.  Unless there's a chance they can fall through that ice and freeze to death, I don't want 
[01:17:30]  to watch it.  Did we lose, or did we win the gold?  Here's the American throwing his skull off.  All right, here we go.  Special shoes used for that, Opie?  Yeah.  Comment?  They don't got ice skates.  No?  Just very...  Like slippers.  Slippers they're wearing?  Kind of.  They're sweeping now a lot.  It looks like more for a direction change than for speed.  It's curving off.  No, it's curling.  It's curling.  That's what they're calling curling.  Holy shit.  I never knew that. 
[01:18:00]  Ew.  Those guys suck it.  Wow, that stunk, right?  Did it?  No, no.  Was that a great shot?  I'm not sure.  He used that stone as a blocker.  That's now called a guard.  He's protecting his other stone.  Oh, so now what the Canadians have to do is they're going to have to get a massive curl  to knock the yellow one out of the red center.  You get it!  God damn, I love this sport.  Watch.  Watch how this fucking thing...  This guy looks angry on the Canadians.  Rush Howard's a force to be dealt with.  Wow.  Watch how this thing curls. 
[01:18:30]  Wow!  Oh, he's moving!  Here's Howard.  Oh, he's just going...  Oh, shit!  He opens it up.  He's the curling bad boy.  Why did he do that?  He had to get rid of the guard.  He had to get rid of the guard.  Why?  They could have curled around it.  So now the bullseye thing is wide open again.  Why was that Canadian man yelling like an idiot?  Because Rush Howard is the bad boy of curling.  Don't toy with him.  I cannot believe we are watching curling.  Come on, this guy.  He's American.  All right, watch this.  He stinks, too.  No, he doesn't. 
[01:19:00]  Why doesn't he yell?  Because he's concentrating.  Now, what is their strategy?  It's to re-block their good shot, right?  No, watch.  They're curling it.  Why?  They want to...  Ready?  See?  Now they're sweeping.  They're sweeping.  They're sweeping.  They're sweeping.  But they want it to stop in front of the yellow one.  No, they want to set up...  Oh, they want to stop it right there.  They want to set up...  See?  I knew what they were doing.  They want to set up another guard because the Canadians...  The Canadians took out their other guard.  They have a great shot that's right in the red zone.  Why is Dr. Octopus fucking the coach of...  By the way, here's some info you might not have known. 
[01:19:30]  Brad from Mississippi.  Yes, Brad?  Yeah, guys, I was going to tell you.  I was watching the first week or so of the Olympics on the Today Show.  They were showing all the new suits and...  Hold on.  The guy's screaming.  Oh, wow.  They got...  And now they knocked out the guard that the United States just set up.  But still, we got one right in the middle.  Yeah, but it's all about strategy. 
[01:20:00]  I don't know how many stones we got left.  How many?  It's going to go back and forth a little bit.  How many did they get?  I don't like yelling guy.  He scares me.  Howard is the bad boy of curling.  Brad from Mississippi.  What's up?  Hey, dude.  I was going to let you know that when the Olympics were first on, they were showing the...  On the Today Show, they were showing all the new suits and skates and stuff.  The British had a $35,000 curling broom that they wanted to show on the Today Show, but  the British wouldn't let them show it.  How could that possibly be that much money?  It's top secret, and it has some kind of digital readings and stuff on it.  Stop it. 
[01:20:30]  It tells you the temperature of the ice and all sorts of things.  Hey, this was given to me by Albert Einstein.  All right, thanks, Brian.  $35,000 for a broom.  Shane in Florida, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  See, now they're setting up another guard.  Another guard.  See the strategy that's happening?  They're going back and forth to the guards.  Yeah, but it's good.  Just now they're going to knock it out again.  They're going to set up another one.  Now they're going to knock it out.  Then they're going to set up another one.  Here's what it is.  They're playing...  They're a bunch of faggots playing marbles.  Yeah, right.  This is fucking marbles. 
[01:21:00]  No, see, I don't know how many stones left.  If the Canadians only have one stone left, they're not going to knock the guard out.  Now they have to go for points, which means they have to get in the bullseye.  They have to curl around the bull...  Why aren't they curling around that thing?  Because it...  Can't you give it some English?  Kind of turn it where you get...  No, you're...  Like a bowling ball?  No, and you...  Have it curl into the pocket?  No, you sweep the ice in front of the stone in such a way that it makes it curl to the  right or the left, depending on which side you're sweeping.  Oh, here...  Oh, no, this is the American.  That's Russ Howard.  I want the screamy guy.  He's Canadian. 
[01:21:30]  The Canadian third.  Big running weight on the guard out in front.  Now he's going to knock out that guard again.  Oh, shit!  Oh, wow!  Holy shit!  It seems to be shot.  What an amazing move.  They fucked up there, didn't they?  The Americans kind of fucked up.  He's Canadian.  Oh, they're Canadian.  Knocks out the guard.  Bounces off another one of their stones.  Knock in.  That's a huge break for Canada.  Right there.  What a huge break for Canada.  Oh, my God.  One of the U.S. rocks out and rolls into the forefoot for shots.  I thought they were stones. 
[01:22:00]  That's a bonus, bonus.  Now, all they're going to do here is knock out the one that's really close to the middle.  They've got to knock the one in the middle.  Right.  Watch.  Go, go, go.  All right.  They're sweeping.  It's curling.  It's curling.  Let's see how it's moving over.  I see.  Look at this.  Look at that.  Perfect shot.  Knocks it right out.  See?  This is the dumbest sport I've ever watched in my life.  And you see, the Americans have two rocks in the red separated, so now Canada can't  take out both rocks with one.  Russ Howard can.  He'll yell and knock them both out.  Right.  He's a bad boy of curling. 
[01:22:30]  I bet they can take both of those out.  They can.  With a bank shot.  See?  Oh, you can't bank shot.  No, I mean with bouncing off of one, and then it'll bounce off the other one.  I bet you right now.  I bet you five bucks.  Anthony.  Team Canada knocks both of those out.  He's yelled.  Five bucks.  Team Canada knocks both of those out right now.  My money's on Team Canada.  Five bucks.  I'll take that back.  Five bucks.  Here we go.  Here he goes.  Willie knocked out both of the rocks.  He chose.  No!  Wait, wait!  My money!  Ah, you bought my money!  Yes! 
[01:23:00]  Holy shit, we're fucking betting on curling.  I won five bucks.  Yeah, Canada!  You don't fuck with the maple leaf.  See?  You're getting into the strategy of the sport.  I'm getting into winning money.  I got an amazing move.  What an amazing move that was.  Well, that shot by Mark Douglas, his first shot, was really a huge break for Canada.  Because if they don't get those...  I know, it's boring.  It happens.  He just keeps replacing it.  I'm finally enjoying this.  Well, now what's going to happen... 
[01:23:30]  ...the Canadians have one rock in the scoring position.  So this guy is just going to knock out the Canadians' rock, and then the Americans will have a rock in the scoring position.  Yeah.  Right.  See, you're getting into the strategy.  I'm watching it now every night.  Wait a minute.  Who wins?  Well, that's the beauty of it.  Like, no one.  They have a certain amount of...  Oh, he fucked up the throw.  Oh, no.  He fucked up the throw.  So now they really need to sweep.  They're really going to have to curl it.  Watch them start sweeping.  Sweet, you fucking girls.  No, they like it.  They actually like it after all. 
[01:24:00]  See?  Wow.  Beautiful shot.  There you go.  So Brad Gooshy was coming up.  At first, let's check with Ilfie.  There you go.  So it's curling.  I am now a fan.  I am hooked, and will watch this every night of my life.  Here's a rule of thumb.  If Larry Flint can do it, it's not an Olympic sport.  I'm telling you, though.  Dude, Russ Howard's coming up.  We have him in Russ Howard.  Oh, Russ Howard with the scream.  I love Russ Howard.  Everyone does.  Get in line.  She's walking every day from home in St. John's. 
[01:24:30]  He's like, guys?  She was in Halifax.  No, this guy's a little...  Oh, this guy's a pussy.  You're not going to scream.  You can hear Russ scream, though.  This guy's a little light and low for us throwing this rock.  Russ screams from the sidelines.  Yeah.  Russ is an animal.  Oh, they like that throw because they're not really sweeping.  No, they're not.  But uh-oh, uh-oh.  Not very good.  Wow, that was a very bad there.  That was bad.  Why weren't they curling the rock?  He fucked up.  He really fucked up.  Bad, bad move. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, they're not cheering on...  Oh, Russ is going to be pissed now.  Yeah.  What's Russ Howard going to do?  Bite his face.  And we just spent 10 minutes watching this.  I'm telling you, you already got into the strategy.  I'm telling you, it gets under your skin.  Any checking allowed into the boards or anything like that?  That would make it a lot of fun.  It would be fun.  That would make it a lot of fun.  And I know why that British, by the way, curling broom is so expensive.  I did read about that.  Why?  Because it's compact and it does have digital readouts, but you can also fold it  and wear it in your asshole.  I believe I lost five bucks.  On curling? 
[01:25:30]  On curling.  That's even more amazing.  Shane, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  I heard that new broom they're using.  It's called the Nimbus 2000.  Just a funny observation I had.  Well, it's an observation, sir.  That's true.  A little Harry Potter joke.  Oh.  That's wonderful.  All right.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Somebody did a Photoshop of us curling.  It's Jimmy releasing the rock.  Jesus. 
[01:26:00]  That is amazing.  That is a great job.  Holy crap.  Go to whackbag.com.  Is that in the Photoshop section?  Yeah.  They actually have us curling.  That is amazing.  It's little Jimmy releasing the rock there  and me and Opie sweeping.  That's because I'm the hot one.  Yes.  You're the maniac.  You're like Russ Howard.  A lot of people tell me that, Ant.  I emulate Russ Howard.  That is really creepy.  You dared a dream to be Russ Howard.  Is this Russ?  Is Russ going suey?  Is Russ?  Come on.  You've got to turn up the volume on Russ. 
[01:26:30]  I want to hear his scream one more time.  It's not Russ.  Who the fuck is this guy?  He's the guy that's lighting the loafers.  Last stone, Opie.  Last stone of this.  Last stone of this end.  Of this end.  By the Canadians.  We're only in the second end.  All right.  I don't think there's a stone in the...  Yes, there is.  And there it is.  Not a very good one.  Blanked.  Blanked.  What was it about?  The United States stealing in the first.  Sees the second blank.  Canada takes the...  Wow.  Why do they go for a blank?  It's 1-0.  United States.  United States.  And I have no idea how they keep score.  Because at the end...  Yes, Jimmy.  Yes. 
[01:27:00]  If you have a...  If your rock is in the zone...  You want to shut up now?  Because you know nothing?  I do.  Russ told me one time in a dream.  I talk to him.  I talk to him the way Christian Slater talked to Elvis in True Romance.  Yes.  I like you.  I like you, Jim.  Always have.  Ah!  All right.  Listen.  Let's go to Josh in Wisconsin.  Josh.  Hey.  How's it going?  Yeah.  I live in Wisconsin.  Uh, curling is freaking insanely popular up here.  Like, they actually have...  It's Wisconsin.  Yeah.  Wisconsin. 
[01:27:30]  You also wear hats with cheese on them.  Yes.  You wear hats with cheese on them.  Not me personally, but we do.  You find excitement in, um, in curling in Wisconsin?  Well, there's beer involved when you're not in the Olympics.  Yeah.  Exactly.  It's more...  I don't know.  New Yorkers are a little jaded.  You know?  It's New York.  Well, you've seen a couple of airliners hit buildings and watch them fall down.  Ah!  Some guys, uh, throwing little rocks down the ice don't really do it for me.  I think we've seen it all.  And it's a little weird, because you're drinking and exercising at the same time.  Americans just don't do that. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  They drink when they, uh, curl?  Yeah.  In unprofessional curling?  Well, up, uh...  It's like bowling.  Up north, and in Canada especially, it's all about curling and drinking while you do it.  Mm-hmm.  I like the drinking part.  When you're not throwing, then you're sipping on your beer.  But I can't imagine you're going to be drinking, curling, getting exercise.  It doesn't...  Doesn't...  Something doesn't add up there.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Uh, not a problem.  I'm going through fucking RHW, man.  Just want to let you know, there's no such thing as a hot curling curling in all of Wisconsin. 
[01:28:30]  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Me too.  Yeah.  Hello?  Did I miss something?  RHW?  No, I'm going through RHW, man.  Okay.  Russ Howard, withdraw.  I'm feeling it.  I wanted the scream.  That scream energizes me.  It's...  It's...  All right.  Next time he throws, we'll just pot up the audio in the old curling mouth. 
[01:29:00]  Please.  Pot it up.  All right.  I want a montage of every one of his screams to take up an entire bank...  From high school.  ...of my...  I want to just be able to...  I can hear...  I can hear Russ Howard scream and go, ah, that was 85 in Munich.  Anyone check out the bobsledding, though?  It's got to be the stupidest sport in the Olympics.  Have you checked it out, Ed?  No.  The two-man bobsled?  Have not checked that out.  They were talking about how these guys have been training for four years since the last 
[01:29:30]  Olympics, obviously.  Oh, oh, wait.  Wait, wait.  Russ Howard.  That's not Russ Howard.  Knocks out the guard.  Very good, Russ.  And another Russ Howard.  Oh, motherfucker.  Wow.  Must be the co-ed.  And then, uh...  Who's this?  I didn't know... 
[01:30:00]  I didn't know Dirk was on the, uh...  The curling...  The curling team for the United States.  He sweeps away the ice shavings with his bag.  With his ample yam bag.  He straddles it and skates backwards.  But just an observation on this bobsledding.  Yeah.  Some of these guys have done it their whole lives, and they've been practicing for four  straight years just to get in the Olympics.  The two-man bobsled, right?  You get the one guy that jumps in right away.  Then you got one guy, we've all seen this, that runs really hard. 
[01:30:30]  He's like the guy trying to give the bobsled some speed.  Right.  And pushing off like crazy, and then finally jumps in, right?  Yeah.  He's been training four years to do this.  Runs really hard for maybe ten yards.  Jumps in, and then tucks...  Puts his head down.  Between his knees, and that's all he does.  And he's been practicing that for four years.  That's probably one of the most important parts.  It's stupid, though.  When you spend four years of your life trying to be the best runner, push-off guy, and 
[01:31:00]  then make sure you're in the perfect position, the Olympics are stupid.  You're right.  All right, they're lining up the shot.  Here's the guy that screams again.  Is this...  No, it's not him.  Russ?  Yeah, it is.  I thought I saw this.  No, Jim, you don't know anything.  It is him.  Look.  Oh.  The skip who throws second.  The other guy was lining up his shot.  He's ready to scream.  Now he's going for an easy throw.  And it reaches the hog line to this far hog line.  We'll tell you how fast the ice is. 
[01:31:30]  We'll just watch the clock on the left.  You'll see it's at 15 point...  16 point one.  Now this rock is coming down, and where it stops...  So you know that 16 point one will stop in front of the house.  What?  What?  So, in three.  What the fuck did he just say?  I have not...  That threw a hole in, and now I'm confused again.  Something about a hog.  I don't know.  A hog.  Rush was throwing a block there.  Yeah, he didn't scream.  No, when Rush is going for the...  When he's going for the points... 
[01:32:00]  It's called a guard.  That's when he screams.  For a guard.  Justin, New York, what's up?  Hey, I'm a big fan of you guys.  Just wanted to say that.  Hey, thank you, sir.  All these things on the Olympics, the ice dancing, the bobsled, curling...  These things are not real events.  They don't make any sense.  These things don't make any sense.  It's like dropping a piano through a house or dropping a car through a pool.  I'd watch that.  Me too.  That's fun.  All right.  That sounds like a lot of fun.  Todd in Jersey has a great idea.  Todd?  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[01:32:30]  Hey.  We had a great conversation Saturday night at the fucking bar.  Sitting around deciding which sports should be on the gay Olympics channel and which should  be on the manly.  Oh, my God.  Bravo.  Gay Olympics?  No, he's just saying that a lot of these things are so overly gay and then the other things  are kind of manly.  The one that should be on the gay channel is called the Winter Olympics.  I don't know.  Like the Brokeback Two-Man Luge.  Yeah, the Two-Man Luge.  Two-Man Luge.  A little gay.  The ice dancing.  The ice dancing gay channel, even though there's some hot chicks involved.  Where the guys get in there and do the ice dancing. 
[01:33:00]  Ice skating gay channel.  What else?  Curling.  No, curling was on the side.  Snowboarding.  I think the cross-country skiing has to go to the gay channel.  No.  I'm not too impressed with that.  You can't be impressed by it, but I mean, it's not gay.  It's cross-country skiing.  It's not like they're fucking sucking a cock as they're going cross-country.  They may as well be.  If I could tell that.  There he goes.  Now, look at him suck that cock.  Dude, they're skiing on a flat surface.  Gay. 
[01:33:30]  That's a lot different than the downhill.  The downhill is insane.  Yeah.  Guys, you know, skiing on a flat surface.  You've got to draw a line somewhere.  And I don't think skiing on a flat surface particularly makes you very gay.  It reeks of faggot.  It's not.  It means that started when two guys were in the last guy, and one guy wanted to suck  a dick so bad he couldn't wait for the roads to be cleared.  There you go.  See?  Now we have to throw it off the gay channel.  If that is indeed how it happened, then okay. 
[01:34:00]  It's a no-risk sport.  No risk.  You're not taking any risk.  You could turn an ankle.  Exactly.  You see the downhill?  They're going, what, close to 100 miles an hour on skis?  I like the moguls.  I like watching the moguls.  There you go.  That's fun.  What about the ski jump?  The most insane thing.  Yeah, that's crazy.  I haven't seen any coverage on that.  That is crazy.  Have they done it?  Oh, yeah, they have.  Yeah.  Let's go to Ziggy.  Ziggy, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Love the show.  I was an old free play convert back in the day.  Nice.  I want you to explain the scoring system. 
[01:34:30]  The way it works is whatever color is closest to the center, only theirs count.  So if yellow is in the white, theirs will count until the next color out.  If everyone's outside the blue, there's no point, right?  Unless, if you have like one red one in the center, and then there's two red ones right  next to it, all those count.  Yeah, it's like horseshoes.  Yeah, exactly.  If you're outside the blue, there's a big blue circle surrounding all of it. 
[01:35:00]  If you're outside there, it doesn't matter.  No one counts, right?  No, you're outside the bullseye.  No points for that.  No.  They score like, I didn't even know that until just now.  They score like horseshoes.  So if you're the closest, and then you have another one that's closest, then you get two  points for that end or whatever.  I got you.  Okay.  It's only, but if the other team has one closer than yours, that's a little further away.  It doesn't count?  Yes.  Right.  Exactly.  Now it makes perfect sense.  Let's say you have three rocks in the bullseye area, and the other team has none, then you 
[01:35:30]  get three points.  Yeah.  But if you have one point, and you're the closest, but then the next closest is the other team,  then you're only getting one point.  Then you only get one, and the rest of them don't matter.  I got it.  It's like the old saying, almost doesn't count, except in curling and hand grenades.  Right.  I say that all the time.  Me too.  By the way, I look forward to all the phone calls tomorrow, where everyone curses me for  turning them on to curling.  Curling.  Because, Anthony, I guarantee you, especially, will be watching it today.  I'm fascinated.  You will be watching it all day. 
[01:36:00]  I was going to say, the only reason I know the scoring system is because I was looking  at that girl's ass one day, and I got on the internet and looked up curling.  There you go.  So that's why I got hooked.  I got punching out.  All right.  Here's Colin from D.C.  Colin?  Yeah.  I've figured out the difference between gay sports and non-gay sports.  Yeah.  If you can see the outline of the cock in the uniform, it's gay.  Wow.  That is a huge way to decide that. 
[01:36:30]  Well, I have to side with Opie and say the cross-country scheme because I have seen the  outline of the cock in the uniform.  It's gay.  That means curling's not gay because they're wearing very, what do they call a fitting?  What do they call those?  Sensible or...  Sensible slacks?  Sensible slacks.  It's very baggy.  Very baggy.  Okay, so curling is not a gay sport.  So speed skating?  I'm speed skating gay.  Gay.  The thing is, you have to draw the line.  Curling kind of sounds gay, but it's not.  That's the end. 
[01:37:00]  All right.  I like how you decide that.  I disagree with him, though.  Because one guy is sweetly on his knees pushing something, and two fucking mows are chasing  it with brooms, sweeping.  They're fucking homos.  I do believe they have a little OCD in them.  They've got to keep everything clean in front of them.  Yeah, they're all ex-molested victims.  I can clean my life up.  I can clean my life up.  I can't get clean.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Yeah, first I want to say I went to FH Rally's with my friends over the weekend. 
[01:37:30]  The food was great.  I saw both you and Anthony there.  Ah.  Yeah, and we didn't plan that.  It was just Saturday night, everyone was there.  That's how it's just going to work some days.  And while I was there, we're talking about how when Anthony's on Pal Talk and people  IM him, he'll say the name and then ban the person.  So I thought it would be fun today if I made just a free name and I called it Ban Me Anthony.  Yes.  And I IM'd him thinking that, yeah, I was expecting to get banned, but I didn't expect  that the other name that I pay for that I have would get banned as well. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, so it's an account-wide banning, isn't it?  I guess so.  Oh, your silly, funny little joke.  What happened?  So I'm going to apologize, Anthony.  His name is Ban Me Anthony.  And he IM'd me, and it was like, what did you write in there?  I just wrote, Ban Me Anthony, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  So I banned him.  I gave him his wish.  And now he realizes that his whole account gets banned and he can't log in. 
[01:38:30]  Sir, I will unban you.  What are you going to do to him?  I will unban him.  No.  Yeah, you should unban him.  Okay, I pardon you.  Thank you, sir.  I appreciate that.  All right.  No more silliness, sir.  Okay.  I'll pop that up.  Let's go to Derek in Ohio.  Derek?  Hey.  Hey.  Obi, I need to argue with you.  Cracker Singh is gay.  When they go downhill, I understand that it's for, you know, drafting reasons.  Why are you arguing?  I think cross-country skiing is gay. 
[01:39:00]  I'm a skier.  I tried it once.  It's awful.  Well, you've got one man's ass in front of your face while you're going downhill.  How is that not gay?  When did you, what are you talking about?  When you go downhill, it's solo.  No, no, no, no, no.  I was watching it last night, and there was two guys.  There was one from Germany and one from Swiss, and they're following each other.  Probably not two feet away from each other.  One man's ass is following the other one's face.  Well, dude, in football, they pile on each other.  You can't say it's gay just because of that. 
[01:39:30]  How not?  You can't just say the man's ass is in your face.  It happens sometimes in life.  Derek, no offense.  We're going to cut our losses with you.  Enjoy the rest of the program.  Todd in Atlanta.  Hi, little Jimmy.  Hi, Todd.  I'm coming down to the ATL, by the way.  Very nice.  I just got something for Opie to go on the Gay Olympic channel.  Yeah.  Rollerblading to work.  Punch it out.  You fucking asshole.  That's not a winter Olympic sport.  Although you do wear something where we can see your cock. 
[01:40:00]  Cock cam.  All right.  Ouch.  Did you guys see this chick, Lindsay Jacobellis?  What does she do?  Anyone in this room know what happened.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  No, Jimmy, you don't.  Shut up.  I hate you.  Why?  No, she does.  Because you're a liar.  This will test if you guys are watching the winter Olympics.  Lindsay Jacobellis.  Test.  I've admitted I haven't seen one second of it.  I can't pronounce her last name, but something happened to good old Lindsay in the winter 
[01:40:30]  Olympics.  What was it?  She fell.  He doesn't know what he's talking about.  Anthony, this time he does.  Of course I did.  She did fall.  She was hot dogging at the end of the race.  She was going to win the gold.  He just said it, though, because that's what happens when something bad happens in the  Olympics.  Ninety-nine percent of the times you can say they fell and that fucked it up.  He's not.  He's a liar.  In any Olympic sport, they fell.  No one ever said she fell and that's how she won.  Right. 
[01:41:00]  But you know, I did know that.  No, you didn't.  You're right.  But I remember watching it on the news.  No, you didn't.  It was like some kind of snowboarding event.  I don't know what they're...  I don't know if it was downhill or whatever.  It was somewhere.  She was hot dogging.  But she hot dogged at the end of the race and fell on her face and lost the gold.  Yes.  It's a huge story.  Wait, where is she from?  I would guess New Hampshire.  Oh, she's an American?  Yeah.  Ugh, that's what we need now.  Just some fucking asshole showboating.  For the rest of her life, she'll regret that hot dogging. 
[01:41:30]  They said it's part of the sport, though, the snowboarding people do that.  You got to really take some risks in order to get that gold.  There was no one close, so she decided to do a little move near the end.  No one close to her?  No.  So she would have walked away with the gold?  Guaranteed.  She had one jump left.  Okay, that's a stupid move.  One jump left, decided to do something really kind of fancy to the side and just face plant it.  And then the other snowboarder goes flying by to get the gold.  Do you think as the snow is hitting her face, she's going, goodbye, gold.  Did she get any medal at all?  Yeah, she got up in time to get the silver. 
[01:42:00]  I thought so.  But I think she's going to be more famous because this happened.  You're right, because no one cares about snowboarding at all.  Well, most people that win the medals after they're in the spotlight for a day or two,  and then they kind of go away.  Yeah.  There's one of those stories.  Mary Lou Retton.  You never saw her after she won the gold on every meaty's box.  Fat fire plug shape.  They got the superstars.  You're right.  But there's a lot of other people that win medals, and you never hear from again.  Nadia Kalmanich.  Yeah.  We're 76.  There you go.  Way to have updated references, boys. 
[01:42:30]  Well, we don't know any other ones.  Carrie Shrug?  Go with my cousin there.  Mark Spitz?  How about my cousin, Sarah Hughes?  That would have been an updated little reference.  Sarah Hughes.  Sarah Hughes.  Right.  And her sister, Emily, going to be doing some ice skating.  Emily?  Emily Hughes.  Really?  Yes.  Yes.  Mark Spitz, or he should have.  No.  Wait.  Wait.  Who's the other one? 
[01:43:00]  So, let's go to some audio here.  No, who's the other fucking famous?  Who is the famous Olympics?  The famous fag diver?  Yeah.  Oh, Louganis.  Greg Louganis.  Greg Louganis.  Mark Spitz, Louganis should have.  That would have been a good one.  Yes.  Now that.  I thought Spitz.  Could have taken it away.  No, it shouldn't.  But it's not in the program.  All right.  Here we go.  Here's Lindsay.  She falls at the finish line or close to it, and then she got to talk to good old Bob Costas.  Bob Costas.  I'll ask you the simplest question, I guess.  What were you thinking? 
[01:43:30]  Well, I was fighting all day.  That's like that old Brian Regan bit.  What were you thinking?  What were you thinking?  I was thinking, hey, maybe I'll get a puppy.  Right.  Did I leave the iron on?  That could be the dumbest question to ask her.  She fell down.  What do you think she was thinking?  That's Regan's bit about Evel Knievel when he was breaking every bone in his body at Caesar's  Palace on the ramp, rolling down.  What were you thinking?  I was thinking maybe I'd get a puppy.  Can we find that bit?  The Brian Regan, the Evel Knievel bit? 
[01:44:00]  By the way, do we have the crash at all or no?  The actual audio of the crash?  No, of course not.  Why would we have that?  What were you thinking?  Well, I was fighting all day to make it to the next round of each race.  So I'm glad I made it into the finals and even happier that I came out with a medal.  You came out with a medal.  But clearly you could have almost coasted to the finish line and gotten the gold.  Were you trying to showboat a little bit, create a kind of Olympic snapshot, and that 
[01:44:30]  caused you to let the race get away?  That's possible.  You know, I just was coming down, and I was so excited that, you know, all my efforts were,  you know, coming together.  And I had a really great race up at the top.  And, you know, I just got caught up in the moment.  And, you know, oh, well.  I feel backfired on her.  How cute does she sound?  She's really pretty.  Yeah.  I hate to see pretty girls fail.  She's adorable, too.  She was trying the, like he said, that photo that would have been on the front pages of 
[01:45:00]  the sports section, you know, gold medal winner, and look at this move.  But see, Bob Costas does no shit.  They talked about people that are, you know, know a lot more about snowboarding.  And they said this really is just part of the sport in all the competitions.  Yeah.  They just, you know, they hot dog it all the way, even if they're, you know, guaranteed a win.  And you've also competed in halfpipe, where moves are judged on style.  Well, did some of that carry over where it shouldn't have?  Because this is a race.  There are no style points. 
[01:45:30]  No, there are no style points.  But, you know, I was just going out snowboarding and having so much fun.  And, you know, I was just coming across, you know, those last couple of jumps.  And I was having a blast.  I was just riding really well.  And, you know, I just stopped paying attention.  You know, your body's tired, but your mind's somewhere else.  And it just wasn't over yet.  When you fell, can you possibly describe the thoughts that went through your head or the emotion that went through your body? 
[01:46:00]  Oh, my gosh.  I was a little frustrated because I thought everyone was really close to me.  And I thought I lost a chance for any medal at all.  So I was really excited to see anyone go good by me.  Yeah.  And so I still came out with her.  That's terrific.  Bob's whole job there was to try to make her cry.  By the way, this is the chick that's in the â€“ someone's helping us out here.  She does the Visa commercials.  She's the blonde with the very, very curly hair doing the Visa commercials.  She's really cute, right?  Yeah.  They're filmed, you know, I think she's snowboarding or whatever.  Yeah, I've seen her. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, she was the one.  But Bob's whole job was to try to make her cry, and he failed.  Can we get that â€“  I still came out with a medal, and I am an Olympian and always will be forever.  So I'm still happy with that.  And I'm not â€“ I don't have any regrets.  I mean, yes, I made a mistake, but, you know, I can't always dwell on it.  There's â€“ you know, I still have all my competitions for the ending of this year and next year  and then possibly the next Olympics.  Possibly or certainly?  You're only 20 years old, so you could easily compete in Vancouver if you choose to. 
[01:47:00]  Well, yes, but there are qualifying procedures that you have to go through for your country,  so, you know, not everything's for granted.  And by the way, you do have regrets.  No one is cruising to a gold, shows off, falls to their dumb face, and doesn't regret it.  And doesn't sit there for the rest of her life going,  if I just would have kept going in a straight line, I'd have won the gold medal.  I'd have been a gold medal winner at the Olympics. 
[01:47:30]  Something I've gone for my entire life.  That's what they do.  They spend their entire lives training for these things to get a gold medal at the Olympics.  Not a silver because you fell down.  If I would have just hung up on Paul.  If I just would have hung up on Paul.  Right. How many times did we say that?  If I just would have hung up on Paul.  We would have been working for those two years.  Fucking â€“ I've been on dates where I should have yanked my cock out and did it  and never talked to the person again.  I'm like, why didn't I try to get blown?  So I know if I've been â€“  Yeah, it's just like that.  Obsessed about that. 
[01:48:00]  If I'd have only worn a bag.  If I'd have only worn a bag.  Oh, no.  I never think that.  Ever.  Rob in New York.  What's up?  The look on her father's face was the best.  Of disappointment, it was the greatest.  If I had a laugh track, I would have done it.  Herman.  A lot of wreckage out there today.  Herman.  Can we get that audio, by the way, of her phone?  Do we have that anywhere?  Yeah, we got it. 
[01:48:30]  All right.  Yeah, we're getting it.  Herman.  Hey, what's up, Opie?  What's up, Anthony?  Jimmy.  Hello, man.  Hey, I'm a driver.  I'm a limo driver.  Two, three months ago, I picked her up in the W Hotel.  They had a party in honor of her.  And it was her, her boyfriend, and her brother.  And they were very nice people.  And they live in Connecticut.  And I feel sorry for her.  She was stupid what she did. 
[01:49:00]  You drivers.  Hey, hey.  You drivers are a bunch of rats.  You're a bunch of tattletales.  I'm a limo driver.  You're a tattletale.  It's a tattletale.  That's right, snitch.  Why are you telling about her personal life?  I ain't saying so.  You told me where she lives.  I didn't know that until you ratted her out.  That's right.  We want an address.  You were saying before where she lives.  What's the street number?  What's the street number?  What's the street number?  Give me the street.  What for?  What for? 
[01:49:30]  Herman, thank you.  I don't know.  Is the name of the box?  Anthony.  No.  Anthony.  No.  Your impression of my dog.  That's the best, bro.  Thank you, my friend.  Now I like him.  Way to be topical.  Fucking asshole, my dog.  Now I like him.  Thank you, Herman.  Why don't we take a break?  Sherrod is here from Best Week Ever on VH1.  We got foot here.  Right.  And Joe Dirt.  Frank goes back to, wow. 
[01:50:00]  He looked like the dude from Mad Magazine.  John H. Glenn.  John H. Glenn High School.  What's the dude from Mad Magazine he looks like?  Alfred E. Newman?  Alfred E. Newman.  Frank's the guy that disappeared.  No, no, no.  Not the main guy.  One of the characters in there.  Holy crap.  I don't think that guy had a name.  Oh, I know the guy with the feet that would flip down.  Oh, what the heck is that guy's doing?  Yeah.  Not Roger Kaputnik.  Trust me, it's not flattering.  We're just trying to figure out the name.  Roger Kaputnik in Mad Magazine.  Wow.  He was a very funny character.  Frank's one of those friends that you have that disappear. 
[01:50:30]  Like, he disappeared for 20 years.  And then he was in West Virginia?  North Carolina.  North Carolina.  It's all the same to me.  It's all the same.  How was unloading the ships today, Ben?  A little cold out there?  Ben's just like a fucking longshoreman.  You'll never work those docks again, Terry.  That's great, Ben.  Longshoreman, Ben.  He's going to catch it. 
[01:51:00]  Terry Sparks, he produces the Opie and Anthony Shaw, and he, we got Johnny Friendly on Tuesday.  Let's go to break with the Brian Regan and Evel Knievel bit we were talking about, okay?  Okay.  And we'll continue.  Although I like the daredevil thing, you know?  I used to enjoy watching Evel Knievel, and I feel bad for him now.  He's a little older.  He doesn't jump.  But he always does these talk shows.  And every time he does one, they want to show him that footage where he fell off the motorcycle and bounced around like 83 times.  That's what they show him. 
[01:51:30]  Hey, do you remember that day, Evel?  Oh, no.  I don't remember.  And they always ask him what he was thinking right before he hit the ground.  What kind of question is that?  What were you thinking right before he hit the ground, Evel?  What were you thinking?  I remember thinking, hey, did I turn off the iron?  Then my leg cracked in half.  Then I was thinking, hey, maybe I should get a puppy.  What do you think I was thinking?  I was thinking, ah!  Ah!  Something like that, if I remember right. 
[01:52:00]  Let me go back.  Yeah, yeah.  Ah!  I believe those are my thoughts.  I hope I've crystallized them for you.  The lyrics kick in.  We haven't traveled with that music, yeah! 
[01:52:30]  White boy music.  What, y'all white?  I just want to intimidate Sherrod.  Yeah, this will do it.  Yeah.  I live on the up east side.  20-year-old song.  Opie, you're white.  This past the white says, but like 65.  All of her falling.  Okay, good.  People love when you talk with your mouth full, by the way.  I can't help it.  Jimmy eats on the show.  You're the only one that doesn't eat on the show because you don't eat in general.  But everyone loves Jimmy.  I eat a bagel. 
[01:53:00]  I eat a bagel.  I didn't like the way he passed the buck.  But Jimmy does it.  Jimmy does it, too.  You're the boss.  I just follow your lead.  You say don't eat, I don't eat.  Even when I get home, it's up to you.  Can I eat?  All right.  Chew.  Sherrod.  Chew it.  Chew it.  God.  Usually we give a really good intro.  I'm sorry.  I was hungry.  The chewing intro.  Granola.  From Best Week Ever.  I love Sherrod on Best Week Ever. 
[01:53:30]  Thank you, Opie.  Thank you.  It's a great show.  I'm the black dude.  Other one.  Other one.  Mike Britt.  Jesus, they put that scary fuck on television?  Mike, he's actually a really nice guy, but he has a prison face, and he can't help it.  He's the meanest looking guy on the East Coast.  He'll never be in prime time?  Oh, dude.  He's fucking really unpleasant to look at, and he's a nice guy.  He's a soft-spoken guy, but he just looks fucking mean.  That's great.  Before we get into some things with Sherrod, we've got to go to the phones here. 
[01:54:00]  Remember Chris from Japan on Friday?  Oh, he was asleep.  He was asleep.  We picked him up, and all we heard was snoring, and he was calling from Japan, and we left him  on hold because the rates are so economical.  Yeah, we realized he was calling from tomorrow, so we were very interested in what he had to  say.  He had the future right there at his fingertips, yet he was asleep.  And we had some kind of Powerball drawing.  I mean, we could have used his help.  Because it was after midnight in Japan, so it was the day after it was here, and I would 
[01:54:30]  have liked to have known, yeah, a lot of numbers, things like that, maybe what happened  at Belmont, and all we got was snoring.  What a Twilight Zone-y, ironic kind of episode that was for us.  Chris?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  He's awake today.  Absolutely.  What day is it?  What's up, Jimmy?  Are you calling from Tuesday?  Absolutely.  Is it Tuesday there?  Well, I got another about 50 minutes, and it's Tuesday.  Oh, it's still Monday.  You got to call us when it's Tuesday.  It's not tomorrow yet.  Come on.  Didn't I stay on hold long enough the other day? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, what happened to you?  My phone's going to be fucking outrageous now.  Thank you.  What happened to you?  Yeah, but you paid in that yen.  That's nothing, right?  You called us Friday, right?  And you had something very important to say, and then you fell asleep because we didn't  get to you in time.  What were you going to say on Friday?  Hey, I was just going to call and let you guys know that I was spreading the wow in Japan.  I got my wow stickers over here, ready to spread the love.  I hope they have a magnifying glass.  Absolutely.  They don't tolerate that shit over there.  Those conservative fuckers.  In a military prison.  Lop his hands off. 
[01:55:30]  It's quite a bit.  You could shit on people, but you got to cover up the pubic hair with pixelation.  Fucking Japs.  They really are.  Civilized savages.  Shit their mouth, but no blink eyes.  It's rude.  Oh, man.  Weren't there vending machines?  I read something about vending machines where you could buy women's used panties.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, dude.  They're advanced.  I've been walking around for that shit, but I haven't seen any of it.  No?  I did find something for you, though, Anthony, today. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  I found a nice pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes.  Lucky.  You know we won the war against the dreaded Japs with luckies.  Exactly.  Wow.  When I get back to the U.S., man.  Dude, what are you doing over there?  I just came over for some work.  What kind of work?  Oh, it's some automotive.  Some young girls.  Yeah, he's a white slave trader.  Yeah.  I was going to be a slave trader when I hear you.  A big fucking container ship full of nail workers and Yankee cranky shop workers. 
[01:56:30]  Little blondes from fucking New Hampshire and Connecticut and other white towns.  We are weak.  If you guys want to go ahead and write down what you want, I'll be sure to ship them back for you.  So you do what?  Construction or what?  Uh, just do some, uh, stuff like that.  What are you doing?  What are you, Mafia?  Exactly.  Nah, do some, uh, buying and shit over here.  Remember the crazy, uh, 88s?  Yeah.  Crazy 88s.  Crazy 88s.  Yep.  No, he's not.  He's fucking Bill Murray in Lost of Translation.  Just some duller hoping a young chick fucks him and he strikes out horribly. 
[01:57:00]  Exactly.  Aren't we all?  He's about to blow him and he falls asleep on the phone.  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  So, Hollering Howard has them off.  Hollering Howard.  Ooh, they're ripping me off, Robin.  I'm the original Hollering Howard.  He's got a nickname, Hollering...  Hollering Howard, Robin.  Hollering Howard.  That's what they called me back at WNBC.  Hollering Howard.  Ooh, shut up.  Anything else, Chris? 
[01:57:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, that's it, boys.  All right.  So...  I want to be able to actually catch out the whole show.  I only caught about 10 minutes of the replay and I was like, holy shit, because I couldn't  remember what happened.  Dude, wait, wait, wait.  We don't care about what we did.  What are we going to do tomorrow on our show?  Oh, shit.  Is it funny?  I don't know, dude.  Call us back.  Call us when it's Tuesday and tell us if our show was good tomorrow, because if it wasn't,  I'm not coming in.  All right.  Good deal.  Yeah, I want to know what after where to work tomorrow.  Tell me what the weather's going to be for Tuesday.  Who do I get the fuck tomorrow? 
[01:58:00]  I want to know who I'm fucking tomorrow.  Yeah, I have a date tonight, too.  Should I bring a bag or should I not bring a bag?  I'm going to go with no, and Opie, you should wear the periwinkle shirt.  I don't wear periwinkle.  That was Anthony.  Although I haven't worn it since.  Yeah.  My poor periwinkle shirt got so fucking ripped apart.  That was awful.  That was a gentleman's shirt.  Try wearing a guy's shirt with a little periwinkle in it in this homophobic fucking atmosphere.  You would have gotten less shit if you wore the cruising box cover.  It's not like I wore the dick-in-my-mouth accessorizer. 
[01:58:30]  Please.  But it was periwinkle.  It was periwinkle.  That's a little rough.  Which I called blue until I was told it was periwinkle.  Chris, you're going to be the man from the future, so you've got to call from time to time.  All right.  No problem, bro.  Until you get back into the States.  All right.  Why is he in Japan, this dude?  He won't tell us.  He's building paper houses or he's in a drug trade.  Yeah.  What kind of construction do you do?  We really don't know.  We need more rice paper for this wall.  It's something creepy. 
[01:59:00]  More nanoclobes.  Exactly.  The problem with your plumbing got to take down an entire wall.  Yeah.  It's going to take 10 minutes.  Do they still have paper walls over there?  What's that?  They still got paper walls in their houses over there?  Some of the older places do, but most of the stuff's pretty modern over here now.  Yeah.  What are they up to?  Styrofoam?  Yeah, exactly.  It's 1972 over there.  The main curtain on the wall.  Awful paper bamboo walls.  I see how they depict my people in a toothpaste over there, all right?  You see that?  The black face toothpaste?  No.  What is it?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:59:30]  They got some real racist, like, it's the same shit that was going on here back in, like,  the 50s and 40s, where they would have, like, Sambo soap and shit like that.  It's still going on.  Really?  I mean, it's good stuff.  It's good to know it's alive somewhere.  Now he can sleep.  Hope he can sleep.  Do they spell it, though, keeps your teeth white?  Because that would be a little racist.  A little rough with the translation sometimes.  All right, Chris.  We're done with that.  Thank you.  Thank you very much. 
[02:00:00]  We got the snowboarder falling.  Okay.  Pop culture this week, the best week ever doing anything on the Olympics, Sherrod?  It stinks.  That's basically what you guys are about with that?  That's the angle you're taking?  No one's really paying attention to this.  Bodie Miller came in, like, what, 12th?  Who?  See?  Who?  No.  The drinker.  The drinker.  The skier.  Right.  Shut up, Jimmy.  I know who that Bodie Miller is.  No, you don't.  Bodie?  You don't know Bodie?  He goes, Bodie.  All right, what's Bodie about?  The kid who was on 60 Minutes was like he was drunk.  Don't tell him anymore.  No, but he was on 60 Minutes.  Shut up, you boy. 
[02:00:30]  You suck your shit.  I know exactly, Bodie.  Sherrod and I talked about that last time at the cellar.  You know nothing.  We laughed.  We were like, Bodie.  How he high-fived.  And Sherrod pulled out his 10-inch cock and I laughed at it and cried that I didn't have  one.  Fucking Sherrod's cock is legendary.  We'll talk about that.  It's disgusting.  Wow.  I left it home.  It's fucking, it's a thing legends are made of.  Is that the toothpaste?  Holy shit.  You got, like, top hat and kind of Uncle Ben Rice looking guy on there.  Oh, wow.  Wearing a top hat and a, the tux tie.  Okay.  I'm glad Coretta Sky King died so she didn't have to see this. 
[02:01:00]  I'm sure she would have.  It's really called Darkie?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  The toothpaste is called Darkie?  Called Darkie.  Oh, that's wonderful.  I blame Gwen Stefani.  She's hanging out with him.  Oh, yeah.  She's bringing him over.  Bringing him over here in the boat.  Letting him dance with her.  You know, the black community, FUBU ought to put out something called, like, chink.  Nice.  Something, just get back at these guys, you know?  An eye for an eye kind of thing.  Chink.  All right.  That's payback for all the screaming in the Chinese restaurants above 120th Street. 
[02:01:30]  More rice, motherfucker.  It's a middle gate between us.  How are you going to turn into a middle gate?  Handing fucking wonton soup through something you use on a bank.  A fucking plexiglass Lazy Susan for your chopsticks.  I feel sorry for your mother.  What do you say about my mother?  Jimmy, you wanted the audio of the snowboarder falling.  Yeah, I just want to hear if it was any event. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Lindsay did everything she was supposed to do.  She got out in a difficult position out of the gate and was able to pull over and pull away from all the contacts.  Like I said, all she wanted was the whole shot, and she could just run with it.  Exactly.  Oh!  Jacob Ellis goes down!  Jacob Ellis goes down!  A shocker on the home stretch.  Tanya Green of Switzerland grabs the gold, and Jacob Ellis hits the silver. 
[02:02:30]  What?  The commentator, all he had was,  What?  What?  Oh!  Oh, my gosh!  Down goes Jacob Bella!  Down goes Jacob Bella!  Another quick clip here.  You know, I don't want to speculate here, but she fully did.  She tweaked out an air, and that's what put her down.  Celebratory, perhaps.  Right there.  She torques the board out, pulls it out in front of her.  She goes down on her heels. 
[02:03:00]  That's what happened.  She didn't land flat face.  She landed on her heels.  She just went down on a showboat trick.  Second to last jump, and she goes down on a showboat trick.  How great is that?  The winner games are gay.  That's why nobody's watching.  Even the announcers, everybody in there involved just is...  Flaming.  Well, it's the year of the gay in general.  Anthony was bringing this up in the office.  It really is.  This is the year of the gay.  2006 is going to just continue being the year of the gay.  We have the Brokeback Mountain, which, I don't know, I don't think it would have flew in 2005. 
[02:03:30]  But in 2006, the year of the gay, everyone loves it.  All our troops are gone.  All the real men are not in this country right now.  Is that what it is?  That's what it is.  We're back.  They're fighting the war.  All the middle sexuals that we all hear.  Holy shit.  I never even thought of it.  Wait till the boys get back.  Don't put it into all this nonsense.  The boys are home.  We got a bunch of faggots and a bunch of women with huge biceps riveting planes.  That's a great observation, man.  God damn.  The real men are all gone off fighting. 
[02:04:00]  Quarter of a million real men fucking off into the country.  Brokeback Mountain movies that people are going to and loving.  Truman Capote.  Truman Capote.  And then over the weekend, Friday night, I went to go see...  Trans-America?  God Sees God.  What's that?  Dog Sees God.  It's the Charlie Brown growing up kind of play.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, yeah.  It's actually a really good show, but it's a bit on the shocking side.  It's a little shocking when Charlie Brown and what's his name? 
[02:04:30]  The piano player.  They call him Beethoven.  They call him Beethoven in there because they got to change some names.  Right, right.  Because Charles Schultz, well, the family would not be happy.  He'll dig himself out to get that money.  Exactly.  So they call him Beethoven, but they're making out.  Charlie Brown.  Yeah.  Wow.  Charlie Brown, a little kissing going on there.  What about Peppermint Patty?  She was always a lesbian also.  Yeah, well, there's a little lesbian kind of action going on with her and Velma.  Marcy. 
[02:05:00]  Marcy.  Scooby-Doo.  Her name was Marcy.  Was it Darcy in the thing or Marcy in the cartoon?  Yeah, something like that.  I don't know.  They changed it.  But they started, like, doing things, and they're like drunk chicks in school.  Real hot, though.  And then-  And who was the dirty one?  Pigpen.  Pigpen.  Because now he carries around the soap and the-  Yeah, the Purell.  The Purell.  And he's like a clean freak.  He's a clean freak.  And then there's one guy that's the fag basher.  Yeah, but he used to-  Oh, wait.  Who is the guy that now smokes pot?  That's Linus.  Linus, yeah.  And he smoked his blanket.  Linus is a pothead with dreads. 
[02:05:30]  And he smoked his blanket, right?  Smoked his blanket.  Oh, they really changed his-  Yeah, they really changed it around.  But this whole thing is about how, you know, they're gay, and how Charlie Brown is going  to kind of change his life.  And the gayness is just, like, kind of moving into everything.  Everybody is-  We got hoodwinked, man, because we had the actor on that was in American Pie.  Yeah.  And he's telling us all about this great play.  We're like, damn, man, it sounds good.  But he left out the-  The gay part.  Yeah, well, you don't want to give out the big shocker.  That's a big point, though.  It shouldn't have been missed. 
[02:06:00]  It was in a playbill.  I'm playing Charlie Brown.  I can't- I'm a fag.  I can't get over the fact, though, of cock that I'm Charlie Brown.  Jesus.  Holding that big round head by the ears.  With that one little tuft of hair.  I just hold it and fuck his mouth like a unicorn.  Oh, man.  Yeah, but it's just the year, it seems that now,  all these things-  Gay is huge right now.  They're being accepted like this.  They're just going to take our iconic things from our youth 
[02:06:30]  and just gay them up.  Exactly.  First, it was fat.  Fat took over first.  It was the celebrity fit club and the biggest loser,  and everybody was having to be fat and fat actress.  And now went from fat to gay.  Gay now is going to be completely taking over.  Already took over the Brady Bunch.  See that, Robert Reed?  Yeah.  Who saw that coming?  Everyone.  Look at football.  Look at football.  Everybody's crying.  Everybody's going to be on that 70s show with a pair of gays.  Really?  Oh, Greg and Peter.  Wait, give him the mic.  Yeah.  No.  Hold on. 
[02:07:00]  Here's Frank.  You know something?  Give the hillbilly a mic.  Where were you born?  Where were you born?  Huntington.  You were born in Huntington.  Yes.  Now, go say what you just said.  The two of the Brady boys are going to be on that 70s show.  God damn, two of the Brady boys are going to be on that 70s show.  What a damn Brady boys.  I was born in Huntington, New York.  South Huntington, though.  This guy's from the same area we grew up in.  Dude, what happened to you?  Exactly.  What happened?  He's a block away from me.  What do you mean what happened?  I've been gone for 20 years.  What?  I've been gone for 20 years. 
[02:07:30]  Where did you move to?  Mississippi in 1967?  How's Emmett Till?  Is he okay?  Wow.  The guy grew up in Huntington, Long Island.  Wow.  And now it's like, god damn.  God damn Brady boys, two negros, and a fat chick.  God damn it.  Now we call them colored down there.  Don't you get that confused.  They sure do look delicious.  He's using the water fountain.  Why do you believe it? 
[02:08:00]  Why is there a picture of my toothbrush on the internet screen?  God damn.  But he's right.  Greg and Peter are going to play gay guys on the 70s show.  Are they going to kiss?  That's right.  Suppose they're going to kiss and everything.  Dare to dream.  Everything they learned from Robert Reed.  My father, my son, huh?  Yeah.  Shuffle around in a frayed robe.  Some tissues in the pocket.  A little pet that a friend's got to take care of.  Tiger is now a poodle. 
[02:08:30]  That 70s show episode's called The Broth.  Do you watch NASCAR?  No.  No?  Really?  That's why he got kicked out of West Virginia.  Wow.  And me, Virginia.  Wherever.  And me, sometimes, I don't eat fried chicken.  No.  Every so often, right?  You just don't feel like it.  Yeah, the Wednesday.  But everything's getting gay now.  You're in football.  Everybody's crying this season.  You saw everybody crying to get Jerome Bettis up.  It's like, man, you're a football player, dude.  Not even the football players can be manly. 
[02:09:00]  No.  They're crying and hugging.  Unbelievable.  It is year of the gay.  Remember that.  2006.  Year of the gay.  Maybe you can give that periwinkle shirt a shot again.  Yeah.  I'm going to wear it tomorrow.  Sherrod just reminded me of something that we have for the show.  Crying audio?  Yeah.  This is the start of another bit we're going to do here.  But where's Steve?  Because he's got to explain some of these.  We're looking for the famous ones.  You know, when the athlete retires and he cries his eyes out.  But Steve has a few that have already come in.  That was a big one, right?  Mike Smith.  Hines Ward had a nice one.  Who? 
[02:09:30]  Hines Ward.  A good cry.  Careful.  Half black, half Asian.  They get up there.  They get up there and they're like.  They get up there and start out.  I want to thank everybody.  I've had a great career.  It's, you know, after 20 years.  And then you know it's just me.  Someone reminded us that we got to get.  I've met some people that.  Friendship.  Someone reminded us of the George Steinbrenner one we got to get. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  Of him losing it after the Yanks won the World Series.  That was where George went, in my eyes, from the old George that I grew up with.  Right.  The turtleneck.  The nasty son of a bitch.  To the doddering old, crying.  Yes.  Like, not the boss anymore.  Grandfatherly.  He jumped the shark.  You know, this is the best team in baseball.  And Joe, you've taken this team.  I'm like, what happened to this motherfucker? 
[02:10:30]  The guy that used to yell at Billy Martin.  And where did that guy go?  He jumped the shark.  Yeah.  Oh, just a doddering old, shaking, translucent skinned old, crying.  Yeah, we got to get to the actual audio.  Yeah.  That's great.  That's what we're looking for in this bit.  Crying audio.  Steve's got some examples of some that have been around out there.  Yeah, these are all from web clips that have shown up.  The first one is the crying wrestling fan.  What's this about?  I saw the clip of it. 
[02:11:00]  And if you get a chance, the audio's great, but look at the videos, because they are classic.  The videos are all linked up right now.  Okay, good, good.  I'm talking about Opie and Anthony.  And if you can imagine E-Rock in 20 years, that's what this guy is, sitting in a high school gymnasium,  asking a bunch of professional wrestlers questions, and he just breaks down.  But they're no-name wrestlers, too, right?  I don't know.  I don't know who the wrestlers are.  E-Rock, did you see the wrestlers?  Why, was he a big wrestling fan?  He was overwhelmed?  Yeah, he was overwhelmed, and he was so...  Have you heard this yet?  No.  Oh, listen to this. 
[02:11:30]  No.  Next question, Jeff.  Where are you?  Right there.  Yeah.  I just want to thank each and every one of y'all for all you've done to your bodies.  It's still real to me, dammit!  I mean...  Make it easy, man.  Make it easy, man.  You're awesome.  Thank you so much, Mr. Funk, for saying what needed to be said.  I don't want to see another one of these.  Well, thank you. 
[02:12:00]  Why is he crying?  He's so emotional.  You know he had, like, parachute pants on?  Oh, my God.  What do they do to their bodies?  Yeah, what they do to their bodies.  I guess abusing them on a daily basis.  With the steroids and stuff?  With the steroids and the thumping off of...  But no, he wanted to thank them for what they do to their bodies.  I think he means, like, thank you for going through all the pain and agony that you go through on a daily basis.  And then he goes, this is still real to me!  Yeah.  Like, I guess this came out when they kind of said it was entertainment. 
[02:12:30]  Right.  It doesn't look like it's that old.  I think it's been the last couple of years.  Really?  Yeah.  All right, we'll get more info on that.  I got the deuce chill listening to that.  Oh, I'm kidding.  That kid is not getting late, ever.  Never.  Ever.  It gets better.  What's this next one, Steve?  Uh, that is a kid that's standing in, like, a riverbed, a shallow riverbed, and his buddy is off camera shooting him with a BB gun.  Oh, shooting him with a BB gun.  I saw this one, yeah.  Hysterical.  It's a chubby, red-headed kid.  He's on a rock in the middle of, like, a river or pond. 
[02:13:00]  He's like the kid, uh...  He's like the kid in, uh, Lord of the Flies.  Who's the fat kid?  Piggy.  Piggy.  In Lord of the Flies, you could tell, like, his friends...  He killed Piggy with a rock.  Yeah, his friends just pick on him.  He's the guy.  Listen to this.  He sounds like a little...  And I'm in the lush forest of Warwick, New York.  Ow!  Fuck!  Stop it!  Dude, don't fucking do that!  Stop!  Stop it!  I'm fucking serious!  Fucking asshole! 
[02:13:30]  I'm gonna fucking kick your ass!  You motherfucking bitch!  Don't shoot me anymore!  No, no, no, I want to kiss my ear and take the CL2 out.  Take the CL2 out and leave it out.  Stop it!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop it, you fuckers!  Stop!  Wow.  That's a boy, too.  First of all, yeah.  First of all, the kid's cursing is hysterical to me. 
[02:14:00]  I fucking...  I laugh my ass off any time kids curse.  And him being taunted and cursing like this...  And he's lifting his leg every time they shoot him in his bum leg.  Yeah, every time they shoot, he's, like, doing a little dance.  What do you think?  Dance, you motherfucking bitch!  He tells him to stop.  He puts five more shots into him.  Yeah.  Oh, you gotta love it, little pricks.  Nice.  Let's go to John.  He has more on that wrestling clip.  John?  Yeah, hey, that wrestling clip.  There's some wrestler that died recently.  He was in, like, in the last month or two. 
[02:14:30]  Eddie Guerrera.  He had a heart attack.  Oh, okay.  Oh, yeah, huh?  Okay.  Doesn't that guy sound like Mr. Haney right at the beginning?  What, when his voice cracks a little bit?  He just hung up.  He bailed.  He did bail.  I was gonna try to help him out.  That's what he gets.  He bailed out.  Look.  There he is.  There he is.  Oh, my God.  He clips up on openethony.com.  He's an embarrassed friend next to him.  Yeah, like, oh, my God, what are you doing?  Sitting next to Rob Reiner.  Like a Boy Scout leader.  Some big fatso with a beard who's uncomfortable. 
[02:15:00]  Give me the fucking mic, you blubbering incest survivor.  Barely so bad.  All right.  That's some good shit, man.  I want to thank you guys and my uncle for sneaking in my room.  All right, we got, the next one is Tom Sizemore crying out his sentencing.  I don't think I've heard this yet.  Who?  It's old audio.  This is, uh.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  When he initially got sentenced for that whole abuse thing and the whole drug possession.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is, uh.  He was high then at the court.  Tom Sizemore in his sex film, Fucking a Chick and Cumming. 
[02:15:30]  He know how to beat a bitch, though.  You gotta respect that.  Oh, motherfucker.  I was watching True Romance last night.  One of the greatest movies.  Who was in True Romance?  Oh, yes.  Tom Sizemore, one of the two cops.  Him and Chris Penn.  Oh, he was with Chris Penn.  Him and Chris Penn were the two cops.  Fucking brilliant.  Oh, Chris Penn died, right?  That scene where he's laughing.  The guy's like in the elevator.  Bronson Pinchot is in the elevator with a gun to his head. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  And he's got the wire on, and they're laughing, making bets on him and shit.  He's gonna pop.  He's gonna pop.  He's gonna pop.  No, he's not.  You stay with me.  Stay with me, motherfucker.  Is he the one that laughs?  He goes, I like this Clarence.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a wild.  Fucking Sizemore's great in that.  What a great line.  He's a wild man.  Yeah.  That movie was brutal.  That whole movie is fantastic.  Yeah.  Love it.  Watch it every time.  Here's a different Tom Sizemore crying at his sentencing.  I deserve to say a chance, sir.  An emotional plea from actor Tom Sizemore, who's known more for his tough guy image than 
[02:16:30]  for a tearful outburst.  And I never thought I would break my son's heart.  Or my arms.  Or mine.  But I have done to blame for that.  I didn't think I ever belonged in here because I didn't do the initial things I was...  That was inside court. 
[02:17:00]  Outside, he was much more defiant, even claiming victory for getting less time than the maximum  four and a half years.  I will.  It's called a victory for me.  And it's called...  Sizemore will remain free while he appeals his domestic violence conviction.  But his legal troubles aren't over.  This afternoon, he made a second court appearance on a felony methamphetamine charge.  The judge in that case ordered him to enroll in a drug treatment program immediately.  Yeah, that'll work.  What?  I just want to beg for your mercy, you clickety-clack bitch. 
[02:17:30]  Did he go to jail?  No.  I'm not sure.  He got a really long probation.  How long?  He's in a position right now where, yeah, if he fucks up again, he is going away.  He has a porn tape, all right?  Yeah.  He was trying to sue for the money.  They gave him no money from the tape.  That was him coming.  That's where...  That's actually him coming.  Oh!  Oh!  Motherfucker!  Yeah.  That sounded like Robert Kelly seeing a sandwich. 
[02:18:00]  He'll call up, dude, why do you got a fucking dude?  Bob's so cranky since he quits his mom.  Dude, what the fuck, Sherrod?  Bob is ready to kill somebody.  You gotta throw me under the bus.  Bob goes from zero to 60, and Bob is a fucking psychopath.  He's a psychopath.  He's certifiable.  He really is.  Truly nuts.  Yeah.  He went after me.  Coming from fellow comics, that really means a lot.  By the way, you're all fucking nuts.  Last time he was here, we were all going at him.  And afterwards, I'm just being a dick to him. 
[02:18:30]  And all of a sudden, he just looks at me all depressed.  He's like, oh, but what the hell's wrong with you?  He's all bummed out and depressed.  Like, what, Bob?  We're just doing what we do every time you're here.  Yeah, but chill, man.  Maybe you shouldn't take it off the air, Hobie.  You follow through when the mics are off.  Hours after the show's over, he's still treating them like shit.  Like we're in the cab right now.  Yeah, yeah.  Because at least he can justify it if the mics are on.  It's on the show.  It's on the show.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  I get emails from Bob. 
[02:19:00]  We talk about video games and shit.  I'm not like, hey, Bob, you fucking asshole.  Don't ask me.  Let's go to the last one here.  The crying bit.  This is just beginning.  We really want the ones from, like, The Athletes and George Steinbrenner.  Those are the real ones we're looking for.  The classics.  But this is a good start to the bit.  This next video is of a fat kid who's staring at a computer monitor.  And what he's looking at is...  Oh, I love this.  And by the way, he's being videotaped by his father.  And what he's looking at is one of those online animations that starts out real quiet and slow.  And then at some point in the middle scares the shit out of you with a ghostly image. 
[02:19:30]  I've been nailed with these things a couple of times.  I'm pretty good now at catching on to them.  So I haven't been.  But these are the things...  I think the first one that ever got me was...  It's an empty kitchen.  A picture of an empty kitchen table with a window in the background.  And it said, there is a ghost image that appears in this short video clip.  Jimmy knows this one.  Yeah, sure he does.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah.  He'll tell you.  And it said, there's a ghost that appears in this video clip. 
[02:20:00]  Fucking asshole.  No, no, you got to turn the volume up and then look really close.  It's just to concentrate like on the toaster or whatever it was.  Yeah, look at the toaster, turn the volume up, you'll hear mysterious noises, and then  a ghost will appear.  So it makes you sit there and stare at the screen with complete quiet, your volume's way  up, and you're kind of looking, waiting to see something.  And then out of nowhere, it changes to this horrific either alien face or a chewed up like  skull face.  Or like Linda Blair exorcist face.  Linda Blair exorcist, and like, ah, like a scream will come blasting out of your speakers. 
[02:20:30]  And I swear to you, it feels like you've been hit with a cattle prod.  Every nerve ending in your body jumps with electricity, and you get the living shit scared  out of you.  Yeah, wow.  Warning, warning, C-word alert, C-word alert, warning, warning.  Trying to keep the female listeners, so we'll throw that on every once in a while.  Uh-huh.  Remember the Boss is a Cunt?  That was-  That is my favorite one of all time. 
[02:21:00]  Not scary.  Scary because you might lose your job.  Well, scary at first, because you jump like, what the fuck is going on?  Uh-huh.  Well, what you were just saying reminded me of that.  When we were at WNEW, and we were going through hell, so we really did hate the bosses,  and someone emailed me this thing, like, what the hell is this?  It's an executable that was going around as some kind of a card or something that you would  click on, and it was supposed to be some kind of cutesy thing, but what it would-  No, it was a montage of cute little kittens. 
[02:21:30]  Kittens.  One after another.  All different kinds of kittens.  Oh.  And basically, you know, the people that were checking this out were all the women at work  and stuff, you know, and they're like, oh, look, kittens.  Cute kittens.  So they're checking out the cute kittens when they're, instead of working.  It's like a slideshow.  And all of a sudden, it drastically changes, and your computer starts screaming at you  that the boss is a cunt.  Yeah, the volume goes up.  Full volume.  Full volume.  Full volume.  And all you hear is-  And a huge graphic just like-  The boss is a cunt.  The boss is a cunt. 
[02:22:00]  The boss is a cunt.  The boss is a cunt.  And you can't turn the thing off?  You can't turn it off.  Wow.  You're pulling the plug on your computer.  It's like human resources want to speak to you.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  One of my favorite ones I've ever seen.  I'm going to need you to turn in your computer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But anyway, so-  The cunt needs you in an office.  Right.  So getting back to this, Steve.  Right.  So the father's videotaping the boy.  The father is videotaping the boy the entire time he's sitting in front of this monitor  and the reaction that this kid has. 
[02:22:30]  The kid is staring so intently on the screen.  He's really concentrating.  And you know he's just going to get hammered with this thing.  Again, the audio's great.  But look at the video because he freaks out.  Spin it around.  Yeah.  Spin it around so everybody can see.  Yeah, spin that around.  Spin it around, Hawk.  The videos are up on opanthony.com.  But here's the audio.  I want three.  The three is Hawk.  I mean it, Jeff.  Oh, man. 
[02:23:00]  Look, man.  I got to say it.  What is wrong?  It's hysterical.  It's hysterical.  But what is wrong with that father?  They're toys.  Children are toys.  What is wrong with that father?  They're there for your fucking entertainment. 
[02:23:30]  You're right.  That was great.  That father set that whole thing up like Alan Funt.  He had the camera, the friggin' kid.  He knew what was going to happen.  He locked the door to the room.  He couldn't leave the room.  You know what?  That's the room.  Steve says to the father.  No way.  No way is that the father.  The kid says dad.  I think he says dad.  Really?  The kid goes dad.  That's hard to believe.  I didn't have anybody daddy at that point.  Maybe a family friend or an uncle would do that.  No, that's a fucking sadist douchebag father.  Holy crap.  That kid in 20 years is going to be 80 pounds overweight in a dress blowing somebody and 
[02:24:00]  go, I don't know what happened to me.  We just saw what happened to him.  We know what happened, Modi.  That's fucking sad.  The seed was just planted right there.  Oh, that's fucking awful.  For a life of misery.  He smacks the screen with his hands like when it happened, he was so scared.  No, no.  Dumb father.  What's wrong with you?  Let's go to bed in Cleveland.  Ben.  Oh, hey.  What's up?  What's up?  Hey, man.  Hey, that video clip that you guys were talking about, that's on our website.  We went to it.  They had my girlfriend do it. 
[02:24:30]  Freaked her the hell out.  It was outstanding.  We timed it up and everything.  Absolutely.  You feel guilty sending those to people.  When they first came out, I kind of was so pissed that I got so scared that I sent it  to a few people and they were like pissed at me.  You motherfucker.  You're trying to kill me?  Yeah.  They really get you.  And now if I click on something and it's quiet and nothing's happening for a couple of  seconds, I go, ah, ah, ah, I turn it off.  Because it still scares me.  There was one with a car driving down a windy road. 
[02:25:00]  Right.  And it was very like, you know, very nice country scene and a car driving and this most  horrific alien face shows up and a screechy sound and it nailed me.  That was the second one that got me.  Brutal.  But the thing is.  It's almost like a maze.  You start using the mouse to go through it and it gets smaller and smaller so you really  start concentrating.  Oh, is that what that kid was doing?  Yeah.  Oh, that's a good one.  Yeah, but you can go to that.  You go through a maze with your mouse.  The more you concentrate on the screen, the more they get you. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  That's what it is.  So the maze gets thinner and thinner.  So you're trying to get your mouse icon through the maze.  So when it gets real thin, you're really concentrating.  Those Japanese must be stopped.  They are twisted.  And they hit you with it.  He videotapes this kid crying like that.  What a jerk off.  A bastard.  Yeah.  I'm with you on that.  Poor fat kid.  It's funny, but you gotta have one of what kind of caller would do that.  Eric in Wisconsin, what's up?  What's going on, boys? 
[02:26:00]  Hey, man.  You guys here in Wisconsin trying to spread the virus.  Thank you, Eric.  The best part of that whole video, it's a little kid.  He gets scared shitless, and he starts punching the screen.  Yeah, he just reacted like a little animal kid.  Oh, Jesus.  A little feral kid from the road warrior he turned into.  He turned into Chaka.  He made a fire from two sticks.  I saw that yesterday.  Man, I'm just waiting.  I'm waiting.  I'm like, oh, this poor little shit, dude.  Yeah.  Hey, send us something from Wisconsin so we can put it up in the studio. 
[02:26:30]  He's going to grow up to be like a Menendez brother.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's going to do something.  We're at a car audio shop, and we do a lot of XM installs, man.  Ooh.  No, he didn't.  Customers are getting a little upset, but some of them love it when I put it on 202.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, punch out, guys.  Hi, guy.  We need to get stuff from all these states.  Yeah.  In the studio.  You want this to look like a TGI Fridays?  Yeah.  Yeah, license plates.  You want to get a lacrosse stick and a fucking kayak.  Put a sled on the wall. 
[02:27:00]  No, but what is he saying now, the hillbilly?  Sable a sled to wall.  What is the hillbilly saying?  What do you got, bro?  Get a curling stone from Wisconsin.  There you go, Alfie.  A curling stone.  We could all have fucking some sort of a broccoli dip while we do our...  Faggots eating Tostitos.  Oh, poppers.  I have faith in the listeners that they would find twisted shit from their state to send in.  That's what I'm thinking.  You just said you have faith in the listeners.  I certainly do.  I think it would be awful. 
[02:27:30]  Let's go to Ruben.  Ruben.  Yeah.  Hey, man.  All right.  What's up, the helicopter?  Nah, nah.  Bad audio.  Hey, you remember that...  Ruben, you're on the radio.  All right, guys.  Go.  Hey, you remember that scene from Sign where they're at the little Mexican party and the  alien walks across the screen?  Yeah.  Well, I had my daughter, man.  I downloaded it on the internet.  I had my daughter sit down.  I told her, hey, you got to get real close.  Watch what's going to happen.  And all the little kids were talking, and I'm leaning over her to watch, and when the  alien walked across, I didn't think she'd have that kind of reaction, but she just 
[02:28:00]  jumped up, hit me on my chin, and I chipped my tooth, man.  Good for you.  Good, good.  That was a creepy scene.  I don't know when I first saw that one.  Man, she cried.  In Signs.  She didn't want to sleep her day, man.  It's the videotape of the birthday party that the news was showing, and they're like,  this is uncut, you know, unedited video.  And they're all looking out the window, and you're kind of, it felt like you were with  them, kind of looking out the window through the hedges, and one of the aliens walked right  by in front of the hedges.  Yeah.  Kind of jumped out.  It was really good. 
[02:28:30]  Everybody's forcing their kids to watch this type of stuff.  He said he sent his daughter down to watch it.  There we go.  We got another parent on the line.  Oh, I love it.  I go to ogreish.com and show my kids, like, fucking, people getting hit by trains.  The Alzar Cowie beheadings.  Now, he didn't clean his room.  Oh, man.  Let's go to Ohio.  What's up, Leo?  Yeah, morning, Opie.  I'm one of them to just go father still.  Yeah?  My son used to hate Iron Man, and I'd turn it way up loud. 
[02:29:00]  He'd go running through the house with his hand over his head.  He hated the song?  Yeah.  You should have smacked a little faggot.  That's right.  How does he hate Sabbath?  I am Iron Man.  Yeah, that was scary as a kid.  I could see that.  No, it wasn't.  Put a dress on him.  Yeah, I used to do that Michael Jackson thriller, too.  He used to hate that, when people would turn into monsters and that.  Oh, my God.  He'd go running through the house screaming.  He'd turn into pedophiles, chase young children around their house. 
[02:29:30]  I had a lot of fun with it.  All right.  Bye, racist.  Cool, fucking parents, man.  Mike from Queens.  Mike?  Yeah, what a great dad that was.  Not only did he set his son up, he put it on the net so everybody can enjoy it now.  Exactly.  That's the point we're getting at, sir.  You need to have a daughter named a Nix Marie.  What?  Nothing.  No, not even.  That's the dead kid.  Yeah.  Because I got beaten to death.  Just trying to fit in.  Remember?  Yeah.  Just trying to fit in.  I got it.  Now that I get it, I love it. 
[02:30:00]  We got Sherrod in studio today from Best Week Ever.  You forget Nix Marie.  Come on.  I never heard the name.  You never heard the name?  That little girl who died in the city?  No, I probably heard it and didn't remember it.  Oh, jeez.  He's still thinking of Katie Beers.  They turned him on so much.  It's like, what's the name?  Is she the one that they're cracking down now because of the show?  Yes.  I should recognize the name.  All right.  We got some celebrity.  Kid looked 40, didn't she?  Oh, my God.  Poor little thing.  How old was she?  She's like six, seven, nine.  I don't even know.  But eight and a half about nine.  Foster home or something? 
[02:30:30]  Maybe 10.  No, regular home.  Yeah.  Possibly 11, I think.  Mexican family.  Might have been eight and a half.  Now, Jimmy just goes, oh.  Oh, okay.  I didn't hear that.  Set you a watch by it.  That was uncool.  We're going to take a break.  Sherrod in-house today.  We're going to talk about Celebrity Fit Club.  Jeff Conway came back to the show.  He did?  Oh, yeah.  He's just a mess on that show.  He went through a rehab or something?  No.  No?  He just kind of left the show.  Sherrod will have some stuff on that, I'm sure.  We also have NASCAR audio.  Sherrod will have nothing on this.  I got everything on this. 
[02:31:00]  Tony Stewart.  A little trash talking going on.  The white guy.  The white guy.  There's a feud and there's allegations of cheating.  What?  What about bump drafting?  Can we talk about bump drafting?  I have a lot of controversy with the bump drafting.  Hillbilly, anything on bump draft?  No?  How goddamn me, Rob?  Hillbilly.  You don't watch NASCAR?  No NASCAR.  What do you watch?  Drag racing?  All right.  Oh, that's cool.  That's like NASCAR without the loop, I guess.  No turn, exactly. 
[02:31:30]  It's a lot easier.  No man's NASCAR.  Pop the chute.  It's over, Johnny.  Well, you know what it is?  The NASCAR is too complicated because of the route they take, so they prefer the drag racing  because it's straight.  That circle's like doing math.  Much easier to follow.  It looks like infinity.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Hey, we're going to go to break with something a little different.  Our buddy, our pal, Bill Burr was on Letterman on Friday night.  He did a...  I missed it.  Oh, I missed it.  Well, you get me here right now.  All right. 
[02:32:00]  We're going to play it for everybody.  Bill Burr on Letterman.  He had a great set.  Here it is.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back to the show, Bill Burr.  All right.  Thank you.  I got into a big fight with a buddy of mine today.  He's one of these guys.  He's like really into politics, but he doesn't read.  Yeah, so he can't back up any of his opinions. 
[02:32:30]  It's hilarious.  Like he hates George Bush, but he can't tell me why.  I'm like, dude, you like George Bush?  He's like, no.  I'm like, why not?  Because he sucks.  I'm like, why does he suck?  Because he's an idiot.  I'm like, well, why is he an idiot?  He's like, well, look at him.  All you got to do is look at him.  He always has like really simple solutions to huge problems.  Hey, what should we do about the Middle East?  Dude, we should just nuke him. 
[02:33:00]  What?  We don't need him.  I actually love George Bush.  I do.  You know what I love about George Bush?  He makes me feel like I could be president too.  Yeah.  No, seriously.  He's like the first guy from my reading level.  The first guy from my math class.  You know?  He's just like me.  He doesn't like to prepare. 
[02:33:30]  You know?  That guy gives a speech.  He just wings it.  He just goes out on the White House lawn like, what are we talking about?  Hurricanes?  All right.  There was a hurricane.  People are wet.  He sounds like a little kid giving a book report who like didn't read the book.  Like he's just out there just like making up stuff. 
[02:34:00]  Some little kid out there like, oh, there was a dog.  And he bit somebody and they didn't like it.  Then we was talking about the Middle East and the problems over there, man.  Why don't we just make a car that doesn't run on gas or oil?  Then they'd all go broke and we'd be cool.  You know?  You know what the problem is?  We can't figure out how to make that car.  Can't figure it out, which is amazing to me.  Because I can make a cell phone call in North Dakota, call somebody down in Florida. 
[02:34:30]  Dude, what are you doing?  Me?  I'm rubbing my ass.  You don't believe me?  Here's a picture.  I can fax it down to him.  He can text message me back what a loser I am.  But they can't make this car.  Can't figure it out.  We just can't seem to get the doohickey into the widget.  Yeah, once a year you see some redneck on TV.  He figures out how to like make his truck run on like ketchup.  You know?  It's always something really simple. 
[02:35:00]  Like I took a lawnmower blade, some turnip juice.  So I combusted it.  Stuck a deer antler in there.  And there he goes down the street.  Ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga.  Yeah.  The dude's a genius.  But you never see him on TV again.  I think those oil companies send a hitman out the next day.  That's really interesting.  Show us where the ketchup goes.  Smash him over the head.  So, I'm sick of hearing these stories about obese kids, you know? 
[02:35:30]  Every night on the news they're telling us like how out of shape our kids are getting.  You know, they're saying it's an epidemic.  Not fat kids, not chubby kids, obese.  You know, like bedridden.  Like just laying there.  Like I had my first heart attack when I was four.  I was riding my big wheel.  I couldn't feel my left side.  I slumped over.  People, I don't want to be a jerk, but how do you get that out of shape that quick? 
[02:36:00]  I can see you're 30, 40 years old.  You ate some fast food.  You got a little gut going.  Totally acceptable.  But it's like, dude, you're five years old.  There's no excuse for that.  Your whole childhood, you're doing nothing but cardio.  You run everywhere you go.  You're riding your bike.  Even when your parents go to tie your sneaker, you know, you're moving your foot.  You're doing nothing but burning calories. 
[02:36:30]  It's the stupidest problem ever.  That's the parents' fault.  Stop feeding them.  He doesn't have any money.  He can't go get a job to go pay for more food.  He's got to eat whatever you give him.  Just put a plate of seaweed in front of him.  Go ahead, eat it.  I don't want to eat it.  Good.  Go to bed.  Those are your options. 
[02:37:00]  I own you until you're 18.  Do some jumping jacks.  All right, I'm out of time.  You guys have a lot of fun.  Thank you very much.  That's a trade.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  It's the ONA virus.  And it's spreading across America and Canada. 
[02:37:30]  Home of curling.  And Japan.  And Japan.  One dude in Japan.  So the virus has made its way to Japan.  One sleepy guy in tomorrow in Japan.  We got Opie.  We got Ant.  We got Foot.  We got old Jimmy Norton.  By the way, his new material he's working on is very, very funny.  I was at the cellar Friday.  Great stuff.  Some good new stuff, Jimmy.  That cats and dogs bit sure is working.  And the girls love it, too.  They sure do.  We got Sherrod from Best Week Ever on VH1. 
[02:38:00]  A very funny guy.  Oh, damn.  That kills at the cellar every time I go there.  And then we got some hillbilly dude.  Frank.  That's Frank Bush.  That's my man of track.  That'd be Frank Bush.  Transplant.  Yeah, he's a transplant from Huntington.  And then I don't know what happened.  He disappeared for, I swear to you, I have not seen Frank in about 20 years.  The forest got home.  He was in the heels of Carolina.  It was like, it went from high school, hang out a little after high school, tour with 
[02:38:30]  our band and shit like that for a while, and then Frank disappeared, and he came back,  and it's like, hey, how you doing?  And I don't know.  I don't know.  That's just what happens.  People move away.  I'll disappear again for another 20 years.  And then he'll disappear again.  You won't see him.  He just flew up to meet some 13-year-old he met in a channel.  God damn.  Oh, Jimmy.  Well, let's learn about the hillbilly.  What else can you tell us, Frank?  Frank, what are you doing up here?  You're working on a house? 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, before fixing my mom's house.  And then you're going to sell it?  Yeah.  Is that the idea?  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  A little business proposition.  Nice.  Make a few bucks.  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of Dodge.  What do you do down there in North Carolina, though?  Build houses.  Build houses.  So you make good living, then?  Yeah.  Cool.  Yeah.  Protect them from the tornadoes, right?  Hurricanes.  No tornadoes.  Yeah, no tornadoes.  I don't know.  I don't live down that way.  I guess, yeah, this hurricane's down there.  Where is it?  Northwest Virginia, Carolina? 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  Well, you call me West Virginia.  West Virginia?  You married?  He's not from West Virginia.  No.  Married?  Kids?  Uh, no.  He's got one of those situations.  Can't talk about it.  That I love talking about on the air.  Yeah.  Wait for him to implode.  Yeah, it's a great outlet, Frank.  Let me tell you.  When, uh, when you had a wife, and then, uh, she's gone, but the horror lives on?  Oh, yeah.  Well, I've been married.  Yeah.  Aw.  You gotta shell out any money every month? 
[02:40:00]  I'm supposed to.  You're supposed to.  I like this guy.  Yeah.  He's supposed to.  That's great.  You gotta find him first.  Yeah.  That's why you gotta find me first.  There you go.  He sends her a bowl of grits.  Sell these on eBay, whore.  God damn it.  Man.  So what, uh, what do you do, like, what do you do down there?  What's the town like that you live in?  What do you do for fun?  I'm a beach fan.  A beach town?  On the East Coast, East Shore?  Really?  Mm-hmm.  East Shore, North? 
[02:40:30]  See, I picked you a lot of woods.  Yeah, right by Camp Lejeune.  A lot of Marines.  A lot of Marines.  A lot of Jareens.  Yeah?  Uh, Jarheads.  And what do you do for fun?  Is there anything to do out there?  Chase blacks.  Strip clubs?  Strip clubs for fun.  We chase blacks sometimes.  God damn it.  Well, that really transcends state minds.  Thank you.  We don't hurt them.  We just scare them a little.  Ain't like the old days.  Can't get away from nothing anymore.  Like that judge in Mississippi Bernie? 
[02:41:00]  But I'm gonna suspend your sentences.  Oh, that's horrible.  Yeah.  Oh, that's so damn funny.  And what do you got?  House, trailer, apartment.  Apartment.  Nice.  All right.  Apartment by the water.  Yep.  See, I didn't know.  I thought I pictured backwoods, a still is kind of cranking away, Frank with a shotgun to shoot the Revenuers. 
[02:41:30]  That was the last place.  That's 20 miles.  Yeah, that was the last place.  Jesus, it's the real one where you live.  It's a nice coastline, right?  Oh, okay.  Fishing.  Beach.  Oh, yeah.  Plenty of fish.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Very good.  He's got a nice life.  There you go.  You're old pal.  We're caught up.  I'll see you in 20 more years.  Clean water.  No hospital waste.  No?  See?  All right.  We think we're living it up up here with our text messaging.  City slicker.  Yeah.  There you go.  That's what you get at your high school reunion.  Isn't it a blast?  That's it.  Woo-hoo for everybody. 
[02:42:00]  John H. Glenn.  Jimmy, during the break, was talking about Pal Talk and what was going on this weekend.  I went into one of the rooms the other night, and I can't remember the guy's name.  He's a big fan of the show.  I want to say T.L., some people in the room were like Kev Slider and Happy Typing Girl  and Kel Hofster, any of them who know what this guy's name is.  The names are hilarious, by the way.  They really are great. 
[02:42:30]  T. Man.  Is it T. Man?  T. Man.  T. R., this guy, he's a large-headed gentleman who sounds a lot like our friend Frank.  The Hillbilly.  Yeah, sounds a lot like our friend Hillbilly.  You don't mind that, do you, Frank?  No.  Fred, whatever your name is.  Doesn't bother me.  Temper of affection.  Big cold, worse.  All right.  And he's a big fan of the show, and so apparently he has a police taser.  Really?  Which he used, and I saw it.  Are you kidding me?  To taser his balls. 
[02:43:00]  Stop it.  He tasered his own balls?  His own balls.  If somebody wasn't running Snagit during that whole fucking scenario, does somebody have  video of that?  Did someone cap that?  And do they have video after of not when he tased his balls?  What?  But when somebody goes, Jimmy, you didn't see that.  Which, of course, I did.  They do have video.  And I'm like, no, I didn't see it.  Show me.  And he did it again.  Not only did he do it again, but then a few minutes later, he tasered his asshole.  He tasered his own asshole. 
[02:43:30]  He's got a good name.  He's got a good name.  Dude, the funniest thing was he's like, he's in frame, he tasered his asshole, and then  he goes out of frame and into the wall.  And you see him laying on the floor, and he couldn't get up.  That's great.  Hell talk is fantastic.  It's the greatest footage ever.  It's better than the Zapruder film.  He tasered his asshole and goes into the wall.  How are we going to get video of that?  Oh, they capped it, so someone will send us a link soon. 
[02:44:00]  We've been saying this a lot.  This is becoming a lifestyle.  Now the pal talk, they get to do all the stuff we're not allowed to do on the radio.  It just adds to the listening experience.  I pop in pretty much on a nightly basis.  To rooms.  There's secret rooms.  There's the public rooms.  There's a whole community of shit going on, from just basic conversation about what you've  been doing that day, to just someone tasering their asshole.  How to...  Dude, it was like...  And he's bent over, and he's so hesitant to put it into his asshole. 
[02:44:30]  Well, of course he is.  As any gentleman should be.  I've gotten close.  I've never been able to actually shove it in, so I can understand the...  I'll turn it off and put it in.  I'll just make the noise in my mouth.  He's so brutal.  Can we get this guy to do it live on the show?  I think he would.  Come on!  He was very drunk.  Big fan of the show, though.  Again, I want to get his name right, so maybe if...  It's not people saying TR Man.  Is it TR Man?  Okay, he was a good egg, and he was very entertaining. 
[02:45:00]  His wife, I heard, really doesn't like him.  Is this the actual audio?  Wait.  I mean, video?  Here's the video.  Oh, no.  That's a different guy.  That's a different guy?  That's the guy that puts stuff in his asshole.  Oh, yeah, this guy puts stuff in his asshole.  He's a hack.  He puts the vacuum cleaner hander in his asshole.  What's his name?  What's his name?  It's right on the screen there.  Rick Crone.  No, down back...  Oh, is that who's showing it?  Is he doing this now?  Is this live?  No, that's somebody showing a film. 
[02:45:30]  Subray.  Oh, Subray's the guy.  Subray is the guy that does this.  He put eggs in his asshole?  Yeah, Subray.  And he fucking...  They came out of his ass into a bowl?  Jesus, Subray's packing like 11.  What?  Subray, his whole gig is putting stuff up his ass in front of the camera.  And he'll put anything up his ass.  We need our troops back.  This guy's got a reality show.  Let's bring him home.  Bring him home, George Bush.  He fucking...  He put the eggs up his asshole.  And when they came out of the bowl, there was shit on them.  And he fucking was licking the shit off the eggs. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, look at this.  Oh, he just popped the...  He's popping the eggs out of his ass.  Oh, God.  God damn.  Is this some sick shit?  Look, it's like watching some kind of magician.  You know how they make the eggs appear?  Ta-da!  Ta-da!  Right.  Oh, why?  This is the stuff Doug Henning always wanted to do.  The private Doug Henning tapes.  Yeah.  Except he'd make things disappear in his asshole.  Wait.  This guy's a fan of the show.  Yeah.  Look at the shit on the eggs.  Why would I look at it?  Look at the eggs. 
[02:46:30]  I saw the egg.  Look at the shit on the egg.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Let me see it.  Look, look, look.  Oh, my God.  No, turn it off.  He put it in his mouth.  Oh, no.  White people have to be stopped at any cost.  This is like an Easter egg hunt in Chelsea.  He looks like Bono.  This guy's a fan of the show, really?  Yeah.  He goes into the O&A fan rooms and puts on these shows.  Well, we've got to find Taser Guy, see if we can get away with that on the show. 
[02:47:00]  I'm never going to look at Easter to say that.  Oh, God.  Oh, that one's chock full of goodness.  Yeah.  He put it in his mouth.  Who's this?  TR?  Hey.  Yeah, yeah, hey.  You're the guy that Tase?  Tase is or whatever?  Yeah, I've done it quite a few times.  Never thought I'd be recognized nationally for it.  That's right, and we have an award here for you, Tia.  Yes.  You have to stand in a tub to receive it.  When's the next time you're going to be in New York? 
[02:47:30]  Actually, man, I live in South Carolina.  I don't really make it up there ever.  Nah.  Frank, you know him?  South Carolina.  Fight, fight, fight.  Where do you go?  I have no idea what happened.  The phone just happened.  Dude, your phone crapped out.  Please call back.  We just want the video of it.  We'll throw it up at opandentony.com so everyone else can check it out.  That's the greatest footage ever.  I guess we'll just throw it up online instead of getting in trouble with the lawyers.  It might be more than one, though.  It might be more than one person.  All this other stuff we can't do, they'll do it on Pal Talk, and then we bring it to 
[02:48:00]  the show somehow.  That's it.  Yeah.  Are we still going to do office cam?  I want to.  Don hasn't gotten back to us yet.  We're going to do something called office cam.  It's almost like confessions, like a confessional.  Okay.  Except instead of telling, they're going to do things.  Whatever they want.  So we'll have the camera set up.  The shades come down, and whatever they want to do in there, either alone with someone  else, we'll go out over the Pal Talk cameras, we'll comment on it here on the show, and they  could be alone yet with the rest of America watching them. 
[02:48:30]  Ooh.  Oh, okay.  Wait a minute.  Two girls.  Guy and a girl.  Whatever.  Never two guys.  No.  That's right.  A guy and an egg.  Broke back office.  Guy and an egg.  Oh my gosh.  That's disgusting.  We're also going to try the Pal Talk thing at FH Riley's when we do ONA Pest Karaoke Night.  And, yeah, two weeks from this past Saturday, late night karaoke at the old restaurant.  We have to give a good date.  That's not a good plug.  We need to give a real date.  And I happen to have my handy counter here.  All right.  And me.  The festivities will start at 11, 11.30 after we get the restaurant business out of the 
[02:49:00]  way.  I can't find my stylist.  What day is that?  Wait.  What was yesterday's?  I think we're going to make it official.  I'll tell you this.  It's my oldest restaurant, FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington.  Nice.  ONA Pest Karaoke, late night.  The 20th?  Yeah, but that's going to be the moment.  And then we'll allow a couple guys to come down with some Pal Talk cameras and their laptops  to broadcast it for everybody else.  So, it was not the 25th, which is next Saturday.  It'll be the one right after that in March.  Oh my God. 
[02:49:30]  In March.  He is so annoying.  Hold on, Angel.  I don't have my stylist.  It might be.  It actually might be helpful because people might get confused.  It's like March 3rd or 4th, something like that.  I don't know.  Now I'm in May.  How do you not punch up a goddamn calendar?  What was it, Jimmy?  It's March 4th.  March 4th.  Yeah.  Oscars are the 5th.  Are they?  Yeah.  I would have actually punched it up faster, but it was hard to operate the phone because  I didn't have my stylist.  All right.  All right.  TR is back.  We'll have more details on that.  It's not really an official show event. 
[02:50:00]  We're just going to do the hang there.  TR, what's up?  Hey, y'all.  I'm actually going to be home in about 30 minutes.  I'll be glad to do it again.  Do it just live on the radio?  Well, I mean, I can do it through...  Oh, and you can do it through Palatom.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, this is perfect.  Get home as quickly as possible.  Hurry up.  We're running out of show.  Log on to the Opie and Anthony live room, and we will watch you taser your asshole.  That'll be the showstopper today.  That's the name of my album, actually.  Yeah, all right. 
[02:50:30]  All right.  We'll be home in 30 minutes.  Get on home.  Hurry up, because we only got, what, 40, 50 minutes left.  We end the show earlier every day, so...  All right.  Hurry up, TR.  I'll be there, buddy.  TR, we love you, TR.  He'll be selling shirts.  I tasered my asshole, and all I got was this lousy wheelchair.  I want to see him fall into the wall.  That's the greatest.  There's nothing to do.  Hi!  Hi!  Hi!  Hi!  Hi!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Hi! 
[02:51:00]  Was that him tasering his ass?  No.  What was that?  That's the curling.  Oh, that was curling.  Hollering Howard.  Sounds like he just tasered something, but he's just curling.  Hollering Howard.  Hi!  Hi!  Hi!  Hi!  Hi!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  That's actually a guy coming in a porn movie. 
[02:51:30]  Really?  I swear to you.  And it's longer than that.  The guy just goes on and on.  He's screaming and shaking, and the chick is laughing at him.  It's ridiculous.  And this, do you know what this is?  Identify this little sound.  My mom?  I hope not.  Based on the video behind that.  Wait, what is that?  Try to guess.  We play a game called Guess the Sound. 
[02:52:00]  What's that first crackling that I hear?  Exactly.  That's key.  That's the key.  That's key.  Listen closely.  Electricity is involved.  Is there electricity?  No, you would think.  Electricity would be an improvement.  What is it?  Keep going.  Think.  Damn.  I know it's going to be the S&P.  You hear it throughout the...  I have no fucking idea.  That is an Asian girl. 
[02:52:30]  Okay.  The crackling you hear is a moist one coming out the back of a gentleman.  You know how sometimes it makes that sound?  Bro.  And it is going right into her face.  Jim, why did you do it?  And that is the sound you were here.  Isn't she wearing a bridal outfit or something?  Yeah, she's wearing a bridal outfit.  It makes it even better.  Wow.  It's called You Wanted Half of Everything Bitch?  Take this.  I remember we had a table with a power tool. 
[02:53:00]  Somebody had a dildo and a power tool.  Oh, the drill does.  One of our greatest bits ever.  We haven't played that in a while.  Maybe we can play it.  Awesome.  I'm a whore.  Don't ever stop making me a whore.  I never want to see that girl's face because I don't want her to ruin what I got in my hand.  It would ruin it.  I have and it does.  You guys want to play Guess the Sound?  We got four new ones.  Four new ones?  I love Guess the Sound.  You want to play Guess the Sound?  It's a radio game, everyone.  Yes.  Guess the Sound. 
[02:53:30]  There better be at least one black sound, too.  Oh, there will be.  Damn it.  I think.  God damn it.  God damn it.  All right, we got Danny.  Give Danny the email.  That's Opie talking.  Oh, I thought we were playing the game.  How's your mom, Danny?  I don't know.  I haven't spoken to her.  Did she get any email?  Oh, you haven't?  She didn't get any emails?  It sounds sarcastic for some reason.  How's your mom, Danny?  Well, it was meant to be.  Okay.  You should have seen what he was doing the other day on the Paltalk cam from the office.  He came into the office drunk off his ass with Derek and his mother, and he's holding 
[02:54:00]  up signs in front saying, my mother.  Tasered ass.  That would be mellow.  It was, here's my mom's email address.  She needs the cock.  She loves the big black cock.  Nice.  I'm your new father, Danny.  Sweet.  And then the word fun.  What you want for Christmas, motherfucker?  After pulling out his nutsack numerous times, you wrote a sign saying, I want to fuck my  mother.  So, I cannot get past this.  Anyway, she's doing well.  It's just drunken goodness. 
[02:54:30]  You haven't talked to her, huh?  No.  Yeah, I wouldn't either.  After that, that pretty much happened.  That's a weird episode of One Tree Hill.  I'll let a few months go by before I can look her in the eye again.  How do you break the ice?  I was just kidding when I said I wanted to fuck you in the whole country.  You want a handjob?  I was.  All right, here we go.  We'll play guess the sound.  Danny is the judge here.  He put this together.  Here's the first sound.  Dak from Enemy Mine. 
[02:55:00]  Did sound like Dak.  That's some sucking going on.  Wow, yeah.  Let me.  That's a guy holding a girl fucking her.  Yeah?  Fucking her?  I think it's blowjob.  No, it's any fucking.  Fisting.  I say blowjob.  He's fucking her mouth.  Uh, hugging?  Canoodling.  I'll play it again.  I hope I have it.  Okay, Jimmy.  Hold on a minute here.  That's an in-love couple eating ice cream. 
[02:55:30]  Vanilla.  Yes.  With jimmies.  That might be a blowjob.  I think it's a blowjob.  I take that.  You guys ready?  Yeah.  It is indeed throat fucking.  Nice.  Throat fucking.  Nice.  I thought I heard that, uh, that sound of-  A bitch trying to talk?  Yeah, that's- that's that.  He's clogging her throat and unclogging it with the acoustics of a mouth used as an old  Victrola speaker.  That's how it kind of-  All right, ready for the- 
[02:56:00]  Snapping noise.  I love it.  Ready for the next one?  Wait, what is that from?  Victrola speaker.  Ah, just some odd video.  A Disney movie, you fucking asshole.  What do you think it's from?  A porno?  No, no, no.  Jesus Christ.  I mean, I should rephrase that.  Get me a coffee.  Will do.  Get to the point.  All right.  You're trying to be coy.  What is that?  That's, uh, I'm very coy.  The next sound, everybody.  Guess the sound.  Spanking at Christmas.  Wow.  Yeah, there's something- 
[02:56:30]  Christmassy about it.  A little music going on?  Some slapping, or-  Getting spanked over Glockenspiel.  I think that- I think you're right.  They're watching Close Encounters in the background.  Yeah, Close Encounters is playing in the background, and Steve stepped in a bear trap.  Um, it's a happy couple on Christmas Eve clapping.  Because they got exactly what they wanted.  Yes.  Each other.  Aw.  A miscarriage. 
[02:57:00]  Can I ask a question?  Yeah.  Is that allowed?  Yeah.  Is the music part of the action, or just background music?  No, it's just what happens to be on the background.  Okay, thank you.  That's important.  Regardless.  I thought maybe-  Two people getting spanked?  Yosemite Sam was rigging up the xylophone to blow up the rabbit and make it look like  an accident.  Vito!  But no, it's not spanked.  Is that what you're doing, vermin?  I bet it's nothing sexual.  Vito. 
[02:57:30]  Hey, what's up, boys?  That sounded like maybe it was that Scott Perel fucker's heart might explode or something.  That's Vito?  I know.  Vito.  Vito Corleon.  That's the southern mob.  I'm going to make him an offer that I can't spell.  Look how they done massacred my boy.  I don't know.  You ain't going to be able to stop no lucha brazi. 
[02:58:00]  If he should hang himself in his trailer.  Stop now.  You're a-spilling it.  Monday, Sunday, Tuesday, Friday, Wednesday.  I didn't want this for you.  Farmer Corleon.  Pig razor Corleon.  Not this, though. 
[02:58:30]  Saul's a pimp.  What's y'all going to do?  Put your musket right up to his head and go buy the beans?  Get it all over your goddamn overalls?  Fancy grammar school boy.  That was brutal.  Tom Mix does not get that picture.  Oh, man. 
[02:59:00]  This is the worst veto.  Goddammit.  He was banging hee-haw girls two at a time.  Please get better.  Your cousin, son, and grandson, Frank.  Fucking perfect.  Oh, man.  God damn.  Vito.  Vito from down south.  Chris in Jersey, what's up? 
[02:59:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  That first sound, is that the sound of Pharrell trying to save his job with Howie?  Oh.  All right.  I won't give him money.  No, that was a good one, sir.  He was saved.  He had no confidence in it.  As he shouldn't have.  With Howie?  Troy.  Yeah.  Cringe from Oregon.  That's right.  All right.  All right.  I'm thinking that it's a guy getting his cock stopped on by some dominatrix chick.  What?  The one we just played?  A little, um...  Yeah, the one we just played.  Wait, let me hear that again.  Let's hear that again.  No, I... 
[03:00:00]  That would be hard if it's not...  I think it's a spanking of some sort, but that seems too obvious.  Yeah.  This Danny's a trickster.  It's not a spanking.  Yes, I know.  I'll bet it's non-sexual at all.  Right?  No, he's not going to.  Stapler to the penis.  No.  Ooh.  By the way, do we still want an adult baby in studio?  I may have a line on an adult baby.  Whoever has the one.  Wait a minute.  We talk...  Still?  Why did we talk about this?  That came so fucking out of the fucking blue. 
[03:00:30]  No, do you remember we talked about it?  No, we didn't.  No, we never talked.  Should I leave the room?  Don't drag us into your sick mind.  Holy shit.  We need to remember we were talking.  No, you guys had an adult baby at any W.  Yeah, we did once.  And we talked about it.  I'd love to get that in.  Remember you were saying, like, hey, let's do it.  No, we don't remember, Jimmy.  No.  But I want an adult baby.  Of course you do.  You're lining one up.  I just want to tease it and hurt it.  By the way, of course we do.  He was just waiting for us to say yes, and he was going to excuse himself to go change. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  I want to sit in my diners.  Got a little rattle.  Just don't promise me you won't laugh.  Let's go to Greg in Connecticut.  That's the promise we had to make last time.  Did you laugh?  Some chick says, well, bring one in, but you got to promise not to laugh because this is  a serious business.  First thing we did was crack up.  Oh, you have to.  Because the guy not only was dressed like an adult baby.  He had to pacify the big guy.  Dude, he went old school adult baby.  Oh, the bonnet?  Like the big baby Huey bonnet, like baby Huey used to wear. 
[03:01:30]  And the big cloth diapers.  Fucking guy goes old school on us and thinks we're not going to laugh.  Big, flabby, hairy chest, and he's dressed like a fucking baby.  Where do you find a bonnet now?  I don't know.  Where do you get a bonnet?  Let's go to a grown man.  You go to a baby store and say you got anything for a kid with Down syndrome?  Like a bonnet that I can put on my Bueller, please?  You got to be specific.  If you ask the way you did, they'll just hand you a gun. 
[03:02:00]  Or it's the only bonnet slash ski mask.  You won't be ruining this family picture.  Gooch in Cleveland.  Gooch.  What are you doing today?  Louvered blinds that pull down in the front.  Sleep time, stupid.  Click, snap.  Hey, Gooch.  Who's the curtains with the Pete Rose hairdo?  Sorry. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, man.  The curtains with the Pete Rose hairdo.  Gooch.  How you doing, boys?  What's up, buddy?  I don't want him coming out of that outhouse with just his dick in his hand.  Back to that.  All right.  It's an old-fashioned water fountain. 
[03:03:00]  We can tape the gun behind it.  Let's go to Greg in Connecticut.  Greg?  Yeah, hi.  I think that sound sounds like Jimmy being the ice cream man.  All right.  We have any more?  Sit and let it die.  Do we have any more guesses on this sound?  All right. 
[03:03:30]  What is it, Danny?  You guys ready?  Wait a minute.  Guy fucking a girl in the ass, her head's hitting the headboard.  Nope.  Damn it.  I had to guess something.  What is it?  That was good.  It's an Asian gentleman in like a sumo diaper getting kicked in the nuts as hard as he can  by some chick.  Oh, wow.  What is she moaning for, then?  I don't know.  Her foot probably hurts.  That rotten little non-existent Asian dick.  She's kicking his crotch bones.  Oh, pelvis.  Whatever it's called.  His pelvis. 
[03:04:00]  His crotch bone.  Thank you, Dr. Norton.  You know the asshole bunk.  Let's listen again here.  Here it is.  Damn.  Oh, man.  Oh.  Gee, that's being kicked?  Yep.  Brutal.  Well, it's an old Southern tradition.  No father can refuse a request on the day of his 11-year-old daughter's wedding.  You almost did it.  He enjoyed it too much. 
[03:04:30]  All right.  We're ready for the third sound?  We got this one and one more.  Let's do it.  Here it is.  Wow.  That's all you give us, Danny?  Jesus.  Yeah, I mean, I gave you some easy ones.  The next one is probably the best.  What the hell?  I just got to go with first instinct here.  A guy's jamming it right up her ass.  Yeah.  Wait.  That's got to hurt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she didn't see him before you did it. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, she's on her bed reading on her stomach.  Suck up on her.  This is Dan T-Man at 1035.  Nice.  I like it.  Tasering his ball bag today.  And his asshole.  And his asshole, Opie.  Nice.  And his asshole.  Sorry, I left out the sexy part.  Yeah, it's just clear if it's only the ball bag.  The asshole kind of brings it all around.  Any other guesses on this sound? 
[03:05:30]  That's an Asian girl, definitely.  Yeah, definitely Asian.  Definitely.  No.  No.  Black man too vocal.  You watch those anime things.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  No.  No.  Yeah.  No.  It's always some fucking giant big Asian.  No.  No.  With like a glowing orange cock.  No.  No.  No.  And then they go.  And this jizz.  Cartoon jizz comes out.  They are the most perverted fucking collection of people. 
[03:06:00]  Yes.  I love them.  The Japanese.  They're all the schoolgirl uniforms.  They pick up the back.  And their ass has like that tic-tac-toe shine on it that cartoons have.  Because it's not supposed to have anything on it at all.  A pure nice ass.  How many volumes of this crap do you have?  18.  18 anime porno fucking videotapes. 
[03:06:30]  Let's go to the hillbilly.  You want to guess the sound hillbilly?  You don't want in on this one?  Why?  What's wrong?  Quimper.  I have no idea.  No idea?  How about a guess though?  Here it is again.  Come on.  Let's do it again.  There's got to be a tool and up the ass is what I'm going to think.  Here's the sound again.  What do you think?  Wow.  Well.  We're waiting.  I have no idea.  Nothing.  That was a waste of time.  It should be anal. 
[03:07:00]  Got to be anal.  I know what it is but I don't want to say it because I've seen the clip.  Say it.  No you haven't.  Danny?  I have.  Really?  Yeah.  Danny?  It's a chick getting her very first DP.  Double penetration.  There we go.  Nice.  Yeah but which part of the DP was that?  Well one on the front one on the back.  That was the back.  Of course it was.  Yes.  New back.  That was the obvious.  Nice.  Just start in the asshole.  That's my rule of thumb.  Opie is fixated on fucking curling.  There was some strategy going on that you missed Anthony. 
[03:07:30]  I saw it because I'm watching it on the TV over here.  All right.  I'm telling you you're going to be hooked on this dumb curling.  Stupid curling.  I'm already sick of curling.  I was hooked on it for a few minutes and now I hate it.  He doesn't want to slide up the street like that.  How silly would you look?  Just that.  Just that.  That'd be great.  Go on an ice skating rink and just do that.  Just curl.  Just fuck people up.  Go to 40 Rock.  We got some action now on the curling court.  Action. 
[03:08:00]  Or ice or whatever.  All right.  The last sound of, guess the sound.  All right.  Oh, my God. 
[03:08:30]  I know it.  What is this, Jimmy?  Steve C. pounding his chest, standing on the body of a prostitute.  That's brutal.  Holy shit.  What the hell was that?  I guess I have to ask a question.  Asian dude?  Is there sex in, is this like, is this off a porno? 
[03:09:00]  No, I think it's a dude singing.  It's hard.  It's kind of hard to say without, without.  Okay.  All right.  Can we play some of it again?  You're the judge when it comes to what you can or can't say.  Russ Howard's nuts frozen to the floor.  He's throwing his throat.  Wait, wait, wait.  Get the mic down.  Hold on.  The hillbillies.  Russ Howard's nuts frozen to the ice.  He's throwing his throat.  That's pretty funny.  That's pretty good.  Russ Howard's nuts frozen.  From the curling guy, Russ Howard.  Yeah, well, I'm glad you enjoy making fun of Russ Howard.  I don't go for that. 
[03:09:30]  He's the bad boy of curling.  Thank you.  And we've got to now play Russ Howard curling audio.  This is real audio.  Hi!  Hi!  Hi!  Hi!  Hi!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Hey!  There you go.  I think Frank's right.  It could be Russ Howard.  Here's guest to sound number four, just a piece.  It's obviously some kind of jungle thing going on, I'm thinking, because I hear some kind 
[03:10:00]  of drums.  Well, Jeff the trucker's got an answer.  Yes, Jeff.  All right.  Jeff, go.  Yeah, hi, guys.  How's it going?  Jeff the trucker here.  Yeah, we got all that out of the way.  All right.  Let's go.  Hey, uh...  Still waiting.  I think that video is Patrice O'Neal getting laid.  Timing is everything in comedy.  You are crushing. 
[03:10:30]  You lost me at Patrice O'Neal getting laid, stupid.  Mine would have been great if you went right to it.  Any guesses?  I'm going to say Asian.  I'm going to stay with the Asian theme.  Yeah, Asians are the sickest.  Some dude, balls getting twisted.  Oh!  Wow!  A ball twist.  That's good.  I know what it is.  That's good.  Nice.  It's a man trying to pull hot toast out of the toaster.  And it's burning his hands.  It's burning his fingers.  Mike.  Mike the trucker.  Fingers. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, the sound is deleted scenes from Brokeback Mountain.  Yeah, it's going to be on the DVD version.  It's not deleted.  Ready for the answer?  No, I'm still trying to guess.  The ball mutilation thing is very good.  Thank you.  Twisting of the balls.  I'm going to say a woman in high heels stepping on a guy's ball sack.  There you go.  Really?  Some type of ball mutilation.  Hello.  I say...  But you get partial credit for the assist because I wasn't thinking that way. 
[03:11:30]  I'm thinking a nail and a hammer.  Oof.  Nope.  Oh.  Nothing.  Although it does have something to do with balls.  Yeah.  Intriguing.  You and Derek in the office last week.  Dang.  That has something to do with balls also.  Ball mutilation?  There might have been some.  It's a guy with Icy Hot on his balls.  No.  But I thought it was.  What happened?  Twist.  Step.  We've given like hand signals like the military now.  What happened?  Yeah.  What are you signaling? 
[03:12:00]  I think...  Than just told him five troops and a tank are coming this way.  Panzer.  Yeah.  We're just going to get the answer ready so you can see the answer.  Oh.  Oh.  Nice.  So we need to see the answer?  It's like a video daily double on Jeopardy.  Click off of WWE.com, Eric, and get to...  If you don't know Eric, Eric enjoys wrestling.  Wrestling sites.  For the bodies.  He just trolls him all day long when he's supposed to be working, by the way.  Was he that guy crying, talking to the wrestlers on the tape?  Exactly.  You might as well have been. 
[03:12:30]  All right.  He's less dignity.  He's not even that guy.  That guy is his hero.  We've got to move on.  The guy's too proud to be here.  We've got to move on because the tasing guy's coming.  What are we doing?  I'm locating the video for you.  Stop whispering.  Yeah.  They have confidence, though.  They think this is going to be a hit.  Secrets.  What happened?  It's going to be brutal.  What happened, Denny?  We're waiting on Steve to forward the link over.  That dope.  Oh, boy.  I thought I had it in my email.  So what do we do now?  I know it's going to be brutal tape.  I'm going to have to bang the screen like that little retarded kid.  How about this? 
[03:13:00]  We take a break, and we'll give the answer next, and we'll look at the video.  I got to piss.  We'll go right on through to the end of the show.  Yeah, and we'll do the tasing thing next, too.  Nice.  Okay.  I got to piss, too.  Let's live together.  I haven't pissed the whole...  Jimmy, me and you.  It's all about us.  One stall.  Two men holding each other's cock.  That's right.  Nothing wrong with that.  And why not?  Help it out.  Come on, everybody.  Come on.  Let's all piss.  We're all going to piss, everybody.  Except for Sherrod, because he's going to make us all look stupid.  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony program. 
[03:13:30]  Sherrod in studio from Best Week Ever on VH1.  Oh, yeah.  What do we got, Anthony? 
[03:14:00]  What is this, dude?  What is this music?  Is it Metallica?  No, it's Megadeth.  Megadeth?  I'm sorry.  I want this song.  Well, we have a new addition to the O.B. and Anthony live room on Pal Talk.  It is indeed T-Man.  He has made it home.  Uh-oh.  He has just shown the taser, crackled it right in front of the camera.  Uh-oh.  We're looking at his lovely wife, girlfriend.  What is she?  I don't know.  There she is now with the taser. 
[03:14:30]  Just arced it in front of the camera again.  She's hot.  She's sexy.  And, yeah, what is a nut like him doing with, like, a sexy woman?  She's like a sadist, so she probably likes to hurt his balls.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Definitely.  Okay.  Wait, wait, wait.  Can we get audio on these things?  Well, that's the fucking difficult part, isn't it?  I don't think...  Well, we can get them on the phone, at least.  Or get her on the phone.  Get audio that way.  Good idea. 
[03:15:00]  Might not match perfectly.  All right, let's see.  Let her tase something.  Can she tase something on her body?  I think she's the more...  She's like the fucking Bud Abbott of the two.  Oh, what is she?  Abbott!  She's the straight gal.  I didn't know he was married to such a hot chick.  All right, the phone is ringing.  She's calling us up right now.  Ooh.  God, it's getting complicated to do a radio show.  She's calling from a pal talk room.  Okay.  We're waiting for it to... 
[03:15:30]  Oh, here we go.  Okay.  Lori.  Lori.  Yeah.  There you are.  Nice.  I'm here.  All right.  All right.  There it is.  Camera's on a little delay, but...  Now, what's going to happen there, Lori?  Well, you tell me.  I mean, he does this a lot?  Um, usually, yeah.  I take three or four times a week.  Three or four times a week, he takes a taser and tasers his balls and or his asshole. 
[03:16:00]  He's a modern day Ben Franklin.  Yeah, for the room.  For the pal talk.  For the pal talk.  You know, what a trooper.  Nice.  Some people just, uh, punch in and do nothing.  This guy's proactive.  And do you have a problem with him doing this?  No.  You think it's cute, right?  Uh, I don't know about cute, but it's him, so...  Your kid's going to come out looking like Voltron.  Oh, my God.  We already have two.  They're normal.  Hey, could you crackle that on the phone?  Huh? 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  Hold on.  Let's hear the, uh, taser.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  That is a, uh, stun gun.  All right.  Well...  We're on like a five second lay with the camera.  Nice.  Yeah, that's okay.  That's fine.  All right, so, uh, how we do this, eh?  Uh, well, it's up to him.  He does the show, so, uh, I guess give him the phone and, uh...  Lose the top.  Let him...  And let him do what he does.  Okay, hold on.  All right, so it's Laurie and T-Man. 
[03:17:00]  Let's talk to a T-Man.  The delay's not that bad, actually.  No, it's not that bad.  T-Man.  Yeah, man.  How you doing?  Uh, nervous as shit at the moment.  You nervous?  Why?  You've done this before.  Why would you be nervous?  Well, actually, I did this shit to get y'all, uh...  You know, I've been trying to get you on here forever to see this shit.  Yeah.  And I got lucky enough to get Jimmy the other night.  Yeah, well, now, I mean, everyone's gonna see it.  This...  Dude, this is going to be huge.  Big.  Huge.  So, um...  And I had...  How the fuck do you bring yourself to tase your balls? 
[03:17:30]  Somebody dared me.  I brought out the taser one night.  His balls got unruly.  Ball, step out of the vehicle.  You know how these animals are.  The pests are just animals, and somebody dared me to do it, and I've always been the type  to step up to the dare, so...  Well, you certainly have stepped up.  All right, now, is there any preparation you need before you do this, or... 
[03:18:00]  I just don't want to show my little beady cock.  That's about it.  No one cares about your cocks, though.  No one cares.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Just, uh, yeah, we're not gonna be paying attention to your little bitty cock or anything  else.  All right.  Uh...  Just, uh, I'm gonna let you have the wife, and y'all just tell her from there, but I will,  I will get the junk out, and we'll go from there.  All right, make sure your wife holds the phone near the action so we get to hear the ticking,  the, uh, your reaction, all the, uh, sounds we want to hear.  All right.  Hold on a second. 
[03:18:30]  Because somebody's gonna be able to, um, sync it up with the video later.  This is the best Black History Month ever.  Isn't it great?  Oh.  A white man getting his balls zapped.  As he should.  Is, I think it is a tribute to, uh, all of Black History Month.  Thank you, Anthony.  This is reparations.  This is truly.  Sorry, 40 acres and a mule.  We couldn't cut it, but we can get you white man's balls, uh, tasered.  I like that.  Well, it's nice to get in their shoes every once in a while.  That's right.  All right, so...  You ain't gonna know shoes are that small penis. 
[03:19:00]  You get in their shoes, but not their condoms.  All right.  Cool out.  He's, uh, he's pulling down his...  He's whipping them out.  ...his pants a little.  Make sure he's, uh, completely on camera when he's doing this.  Yeah, he's not on camera now.  Yeah, take those, take it out.  We don't care.  Yeah, no one, no one, no one cares.  No one's looking at that thing or can see it.  Yeah, right, right up to the camera.  Uh, you're a little too close.  You're cutting off the bottom.  You gotta lower the cam a little bit.  I'm gonna move the cam.  There you go.  That's perfect.  Oh, my God, though.  That's perfect.  His ball bag is now sticking out of the urination hole in his, uh, 
[03:19:30]  in his underwear.  Yeah, of course.  Uh, they're sticking through.  That way it's just like, uh, they call that, what do they call that?  Doing the brain?  Yeah.  Where you just pull your bag through?  Well, he's doing the brain.  And, uh...  Boy, it's all cerebellum.  Right.  And, uh, she's got the taser in her hand.  Is she gonna tase him?  Are you gonna tase him?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  She's gonna be doing the taser.  That's why he's with her.  All right, he's kinda...  Wouldn't be better.  Why, why is he massaging his, uh, scrotum? 
[03:20:00]  They're laughing their asses off over there.  Boy, this is just a fun time.  Uh, ask him, hey, ask him why he's massaging his scrotum like that.  Why is he massaging?  Because he's pulling them.  He's trying to keep them out.  Trying to get the skin out.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Okay, hold on.  Here we go.  All right, here we go.  All right, everyone be quiet.  Wait, wait.  Make sure they see the R.  There you go.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 
[03:20:30]  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Holy shit.  Oh, man.  He's down.  He is down.  He is down.  Down goes hillbilly.  He is down.  Down goes hillbilly.  Down goes hillbilly.  Oh, taser to the ball sack by the wife.  Oh.  Oh.  And they're all clapping on pal talk.  Unbelievable.  Oh, man.  Unbelievable.  He went right down.  Do you know what?  Okay.  Oh, he's pulling his pants down.  Now he's going for tasing of the asshole.  He's an innovator.  This guy.  He's a scholar.  This is like the Olympics. 
[03:21:00]  Okay, hold on.  Uh, the guy not only went for the ball bag, but he's going for the asshole.  Uh, she's been, now hold on, hold on.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Tell him he's gotta bring the pants down a little more.  Bring the pants down.  Oh, my God.  A little more.  And, and he's gotta come over to his right a little bit.  Go over to the right.  And you make sure you hold it on the asshole for a while, too.  And you, you, wait, wait.  Your camera cropped out.  The camera's gone.  No, it's not.  Let me tell you something.  Here's, here's.  Okay, it's good, it's good.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[03:21:30]  Get the phone by you.  Get the phone by you.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Here's the problem.  I'm not getting a good view because your hand with the taser is actually blocking what's  going on.  She's gotta go all the way on the other side.  So he's gotta go, yeah.  She's gotta go all the way on the other side.  And come up around.  Go, go.  There you go.  Tell him to turn sideways a little bit.  Turn sideways.  Right there.  Face your ass toward her a little bit.  There you go.  Yeah, like that.  Yeah, yeah.  Now bend over and shove that taser up his ass.  And hold it on there.  Okay.  All right, here we go.  Shh. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, my God.  He's nuts.  Here we go.  Spreading his cheeks.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  It was a pop!  It was a pop!  It was a pop!  He's down!  He smashed his head into the door.  There was a pop!  He went flying across the room.  He went flying across the room.  Holy shit!  He's still down.  He's still down.  I heard a pop!  It was a pop!  I heard a pop!  There was a second gunman!  He's still down!  There's a hemorrhoid exploding.  Holy shit! 
[03:22:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, that was a good one.  It was like a popcorn kernel, was that?  God damn, was that a good one?  That was great.  It popped.  He flew right into the door.  Here he is.  T-Man.  T-Man.  Dude.  Look, man.  When you kiss after you've shot your balls, it leaks after you can't make the shit stop.  No!  It turns the flapper up.  Holy shit!  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I have never seen anything like that in my life.  Right into the wall. 
[03:23:00]  They need to add it to the Olympics.  Right.  Winter games.  That should be a winter games sport.  You put ice skates on him and shock his asshole and see how far he goes.  As he sounds like, Russ Howard.  Russ Howard and ass tasering.  I don't remember it being that painful Friday night.  Dude, that really arced.  Well, that's because you're under the influence.  That really arced, because we heard it snap.  It made that snap pop.  Oh, it popped like powder.  Oh, God.  And, wow.  That must have really...  And you went right down.  She is just giddy.  Yeah. 
[03:23:30]  She's still laughing in the background.  She's laughing.  Yeah.  Because if they have a breakup, she wins.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, now I'm going to have to go clean the taser.  I got...  Oh, and it is.  Wait, oh.  Nice.  What a couple of fans you are.  I love this couple.  This is what we can do in office camp.  Yep.  All right.  How are we going to get the video?  The rest of the country has to see this.  This is great.  Somebody captured it.  That is fantastic.  Somebody will have it and they'll send it in so we can post that.  Yeah.  All right.  Very good.  They might be in a couple of a year.  I'm going to put my vote in right now.  Bravo. 
[03:24:00]  Nice job.  Anybody who has gotten the vid of that, send it in to Steve at foundrymusic.com, along  with a lot of pictures of a man's cocks.  Uncut.  Uncut.  Right.  He likes them that way.  He doesn't throw out the cut ones, but he likes the uncut.  Uncliffed, as Steve would say.  Right.  I like it natural.  Unfeathered.  Or just, as he would also say, delicious.  Send the delicious ones.  Right.  He likes to put the dick by his nose and pull the foreskin over his nose and go,  look, I'm a part of you now.  Wonderful. 
[03:24:30]  Wow.  We are one.  I got to say, bravissimo.  That is some act.  Anything for my boyfriend.  Ta-da.  Ta-da.  Yeah, exactly.  And they call it the aristocrat.  Good job, man.  Wow.  Anything for y'all, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Great show.  Bye, guys.  T-Man and his wife, Lori.  Unbelievable.  Ah, they're lovely.  I love also watching the reaction of everybody else on Pal Talk. 
[03:25:00]  Watching the girls, Lil and Happy Typing Girl and Lucci.  All of them, their reaction was hysterical.  It had a nice pop to it.  The pop, he went head first into the wall and was down for the count.  Dude, that jolt into the fuck.  That's why I'm so glad he turned that way.  That jolt into the solid obstacle.  Yeah.  He had to be turned that way because the back view wasn't working.  He went flying.  The nice silhouette side view right up the ass.  How do you not dump yourself after that? 
[03:25:30]  I don't know.  So there's got to be something going on now.  That's wonderful.  Are we ready to guess the sound four?  Okay.  The boys are set up with the fourth sound and guess the sound.  The last one today.  Here's the audio once again.  Oh, okay.  I got it. 
[03:26:00]  Yahoo.  Holy shit.  Yahoo.  That's the video we just saw.  Hey, is it, is it a guy?  Are there two girls involved?  No, it's a lone gunman.  He's alone?  By himself?  Yeah.  He's by himself? 
[03:26:30]  Yes, indeed.  Doing something horrific.  I could never get those noises out of myself by myself.  No.  Why would you?  Stop it.  After the first...  Woo!  These guys are very confident in this video.  They think we're going to love it.  I'm hearing some kind of rhythmic thing.  Like...  Indeed you are.  So he's doing something.  Sewing machine.  Working on a railroad?  Yeah.  Sewing machine?  No.  Alright.  We have the video already.  Let's just see it.  Alright, let's just see it.  He's fucking something.  Here's...  This is the answer right...  Uh-oh. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, E-Rock!  E-Rock!  What did you do?  You ruined it!  What did you do?  E-Rock didn't do it.  E-Rock!  Now E-Rock did it.  New penalty.  Taser in the asshole.  That's right.  Oh, man.  Nothing.  I hit play.  No, you didn't.  Oh, you hit play, did you?  What happened?  My God.  E-Rock.  Thanks, man.  Is this on?  I don't know, E-Rock.  Is it?  Is this on?  E-Rock, what do you do here?  I bring nothing to the table.  Wow.  Is this on?  I bring nothing to the table.  Yeah, it's on. 
[03:27:30]  Where's the video?  Where's the big part of the show?  I wanted to see.  We all did.  The whole gang did.  Everyone.  Now we'll never know.  All right, they're trying to figure it out.  Let's go to Mort Gooder.  Mort Gooder.  It had to be an Asian dude.  Stop with now, talk.  Best $60 I ever spent.  I just want to know, how did the two of these, the T-Man and his wife, or whoever it is,  figure out?  Oh, no.  Why are you sure?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We don't need you anymore, Mort Gooder.  Hold on.  Sorry.  What am I saying?  What are you looking at here? 
[03:28:00]  What am I saying here?  What the fuck?  I think the guy-  Is this video on butopianentony.com?  I think what I'm seeing is, is that a butt plug?  Yes, indeed it is.  The guy's got a butt plug buried up his ass.  It's a rear view.  He's kind of bent over a desk.  Right?  He's got a butt plug shoved up his ass.  Is that something on his dick?  No, it looks like his balls.  How big is his balls?  Is it his balls?  Because he's swinging what looks like-  He has a hernia.  All right, he's swinging what looks like his ball sack, which is huge, and it's swinging 
[03:28:30]  back and forth really hard, flipping up and hitting the butt plug.  So with each swing, his nuts smack the butt plug and hit it further into his asshole.  It looks like a broken clock.  Anthony, my friend, you are.  I pull it.  Anybody know that?  I try to weave the words-  That's what?  Wait, what?  That can't be his balls.  Danny, what is the official answer?  Unless it's Derek.  I mean, just hammering a butt plug into his ass with his balls-  With his balls by swinging them back and forth.  No hands.  No hands, people. 
[03:29:00]  No, that's the beauty of this trick.  No, he's like in the frisk position.  Houdini.  Look, Ma, no dignity.  That cannot be his ball bag.  Dude, it's swinging up to his lower back.  Like a pendulum.  His ball bag is hitting where his crack ends at his lower back.  Greatest freak video ever.  Yeah, I can't be his.  Looks like a hoppity hop.  He has a hernia.  This man needs help.  Jesus.  Wow.  And this is the audio again.  It shouldn't be able to do that, right?  The sound makes sense. 
[03:29:30]  What the?  Oh my god.  Holy shit!  Wahoo!  Wahoo!  Wahoo!  Wahoo!  Wahoo!  Oh my god.  Holy shit!  Wahoo!  I will never be the same person I was when I walked in here, alright? 
[03:30:00]  No.  None of us will.  Sherrod is like silly white boys.  What?  How did you stop?  Whose scrotum can do that?  His?  Holy.  It's like how he says wahoo.  Wahoo!  Wahoo!  It's like he realizes what he's doing and he's gotta go, holy shit!  Wahoo!  Wahoo!  Steve, if you want some traffic, get that up on openanthony.com.  I don't understand what that is.  Get that up on openanthony.com if you want some traffic.  Instead of wahoo, we should be yelling wah-why.  Wah-why.  How is this right, daddy? 
[03:30:30]  Brutal.  We're closing the show.  We'll get caught up by a computer in two minutes.  Do you have anything to plug?  Yeah.  Tonight's best week ever?  Best week ever every Friday at 11.  I'm on the Today Show again on March 6th, the day after the Oscars.  Oh, Riffle.  Oh, look at you.  Yeah, I'm a fuck Katie Couric.  Oh, nice.  Great time.  Great hanging with you, man.  Thanks, man.  Thanks for having me.  A lot of fun at Sherrod.  White people ain't as bad as I thought.  We're good eggs.  We're good eggs.  Until you leave the room.  Foot's promoting something.  Foot.  Wisecrackers in Scranton, March 3rd and 4th. 
[03:31:00]  Wisecrackers in Scranton.  Wisecrackers in Scranton.  Alright, when is that?  3rd and 4th.  3rd and 4th.  24th?  I'm in Albany this weekend, 24th, 25th.  I know the Saturday Early Show has been sold out, so it's me and some other guys.  Good plug, Jimmy.  Yeah, the Comedy Works in Albany.  And Frank will be at his house fixing things up.  That's right.  If you want to buy a house, Frank can help you out.  Yeah.  You can catch Frank this weekend in the shrubs outside of a youngster's window.  Two shows. 
[03:31:30]  Let's go to Turtle from Whack Bag.  Turtle.  Hey, Opie.  Today I learned that Hillbilly Vito was banging hillbilly chicks, two at a time.  Players couldn't get any moonshine at the table.  That was a great bit today.  Pat in Boston.  What's up?  Girard Corn Cup pipes for everybody.  Pat.  Hey, I learned Japs are civilized savages, and no one ever said she fell and she won.  We did learn that.  It was an educational show to boot.  Alright, Ron and Fez are up next.  Yep. 
[03:32:00]  Sherrod, thanks.  We'll be going soon, alright?  Thank you.  That's it!  Party is over!  Everybody go home!  That bullshit's over with.  Alright, let's pair that up.  I gotta get out of here and suck a dick. </pre>
