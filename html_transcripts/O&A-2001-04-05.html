<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a comedic dissection of Don West's infomercial sales tactics, specifically his disastrous attempts to sell overpriced baseball cards.  The hosts, along with caller Vinnie, ridiculed West's exaggerated claims, frantic energy, and catchphrase "Jammin' Ten," painting a hilarious picture of his on-air persona, complete with sweating and fabricated studio fires.  This segment transitioned into a discussion with Mr. Movie Phone, who detailed the results of his moviegoer awards, highlighting the differences between popular opinion and Academy Awards selections. He revealed that he sold his service to AOL for $480 million.

The show then devolved into a series of increasingly vulgar listener calls. One caller shared a story about "80-year-old taint," prompting a flurry of crude jokes.  Numerous other callers detailed various humorous and obscene penis tricks with creative names like "squirrel on the trampoline," "turtle head," "bird bath," and "elephant."  This was followed by a lengthy, rambling anecdote from one of the hosts about his experiences living with his mother-in-law, which involved broken figurines, drunken nights, and the unsettling presence of a deceased dog's ashes in the living room, punctuated by repeated cries of "I want to go home." A prank call to a hardware store, requesting "butt plugs," added to the chaotic and offensive atmosphere.  Cowbell Bill was present in the studio during this portion of the show.  The segment concluded with a chaotic, aggressive, and highly offensive exchange between the hosts and callers.

The next segment started with a discussion about a coworker who refused to make left turns, which segued into stories about difficult driving experiences.  A caller named Joe recounted a harrowing tale of driving a drunk woman, Judy, home after a Boston band gig.  Brief calls from Steve (mentioning a picture of Opie being removed from his mother-in-law's wall) and a lengthy, technically challenging interview with 92-year-old former actor Buddy Epstein followed.  The interview with Epstein, plagued by hearing aid and connection issues, involved discussions about his new book, "Kelly's Quest," and performances of lines from *Barnaby Jones* and *The Beverly Hillbillies*, including his famous "Well, Doggy."  The hosts repeatedly played back clips of Epstein's often-garbled comments and performances.  The segment ended with comparisons of Epstein's deteriorating voice over the years using clips from previous interviews.  The final portion shifted to Anthony's new, expensive home gym, which was met with ridicule and teasing from Opie and the callers.  A listener won a "100 grand" candy bar, concluding this section.  Crude language and sexually suggestive humor were prevalent throughout.

Comedian Frank Caliendo was a guest in the following segment. He performed impressions of John Madden, Seinfeld, and other celebrities, incorporating absurd and sexually suggestive elements.  He discussed his work with Jimmy Kimmel, including a sketch featuring Emanuel Lewis. Opie and Anthony discussed Napster and its impact on audio sharing. The conversation then turned to a Dear Abby letter about an overprotective stepfather.  The hosts and callers engaged in explicit discussions about stepfathers and their potential attraction to their teenage stepdaughters, with many callers sharing explicit anecdotes.  An offensive song detailing graphic sexual violence against young children was played.

The final segment continued the discussion of stepfathers and their attraction to their stepdaughters, becoming increasingly explicit and offensive.  Callers Alex, Heather (who expressed disgust), and Ron (who detailed his experience with identical twin teenage stepdaughters resembling Jessica Alba) contributed to the conversation. The segment was filled with vulgar language, graphic sexual references, and sexually charged banter.  The overall tone remained provocative and highly offensive throughout.

[00:16:00]  selected chocolate i just like the way you say that chocolate well my god everybody all of a sudden  has a french friggin lilt on their voice yeah no it uh i think it's chocolate i'm gonna go with  that crouching thing uh interesting crouching tiger hidden dragon gladiator for gladiator press  one yes gladiator yes it's gladiator yeah moviegoers voted that one uh as number one by a large margin  well the academy will f that up and give it to shakla or billy elliott or one of those you know damn 
[00:16:30]  well that gladiator is not a movie that the academy is going to like well you never know you know  everybody's kind of thought that uh about american beauty last year but you know when we start doing  these awards about uh six years ago that none of the movies were even the same you know we'd have  adam sandler movies and we'd have the spy who shagged me stuff like that uh but what's happened  is uh the academy is actually starting to come more in line with moviegoers and kind of pay attention  that hey you know if these people are loving these movies we maybe better pick one here and there 
[00:17:00]  and uh and so uh you know they're actually it'll be interesting to see uh how about the how about  best actor who do you think one uh who do you think moviegoers think should be best actor  talk a lot uh what are our choices uh what are your choices uh what are your choices well you have  uh you have uh russell crowe you have tom hanks you have uh tom hanks and harris uh  and harris how do you buy them you like to say that what movie was that that was before nightfall  yeah that was a big movie no uh yeah russell crow moviegoers uh they love they love the russell crow 
[00:17:30]  your your poll is based on um hundreds of thousands of moviegoers right and and it's  actually the way people think right and probably a lot of chicks and gay guys love the gladiator  movie and they love the russell crowe they do so that's a big vote right there as far as the academy  goes they will they will look down on that movie i i believe and tom hanks i mean come on tom hanks how  many of these does the guy need yeah well yeah remember bosom buddies for god's sake they didn't even

[00:34:30]  these in a way that you can do it on the air all right well the one that is interesting there is the  the light at the end of the tunnel thing all right light at the end of the tunnel is you um you sort of  remove any wrinklage by stretching out the bag right and you kind of tilt your hips back so you  push your butt out so it's a cross between the squirrel on the trampoline and the turtle head 
[00:35:00]  so you have sort of like this sort of i can't i don't know it's a stretched out bag with a little  right at the end of the tunnel i he is not doing a good job all right you take your right hand yeah  you and then you take the loose skin right we know we know what you're doing where you're straight  out straight out forward straight out forward so now there's no wrinkles there's nothing right now  whatever's left above that kind of shelf yeah you you pull your hips back so it's pulled back within 
[00:35:30]  you so it almost looks like the front headlight of a train sticking out of a tunnel  you completely cover up your junk with what you just pulled so it disappears yeah by pulling your  hips back it removes any slack a train like that um the uh and the walnut actually the walnut is you take 
[00:36:00]  your junk you wrap it around the side of the bag and you kind of do a little you know how like the  the grain of the bag goes you know up and down right with the ridge you wrap the junk around the side  give it a half twist so the junk now goes horizontal it looks just like a walnut  the fuzzy the fuzzy fruit bowl is you take it all sort of the buffalo bill but from the reverse angle 
[00:36:30]  you kind of bend over so you get a little bit of the gravity pull you do a little shake it looks like  fuzzy fruit jiggling in a bowl  dad thank you very much well thank you all right holy ass this is the gayest stuff  this is gay he and his roommate did this fag

This just in.  Monday afternoon at 3 on 1027 WNEW.  It's the return of Opie and Anthony and the return of WOW.  We now return you to your regularly scheduled stupidity. 
[00:42:00]  The following tape is disturbing.  Anthony's the bastard.  Insulting.  Eff off, you effing retard.  Hey, we're looking for that chromosome you're missing.  Cubanized.  Wah! Wah!  Rude.  Hang up, hang up. Hang up the god effing phone.  Offensive.  Listen, you little mother effer.  You whore!  Whore these.  I just felt like taking my pants off.  Oh, mo.  Here it comes, Opie.  Here it comes. 
[00:42:30]  Marani.  Imagine how angry, willing, would be if they had to walk around with tampons in their butt.  The bottle's good.  Buh! Buh! Buh! Buh! Buh! Buh! Buh!  God damn it.  I love when you get pissed off.  Do it great.  Shut up.  Do it completely.  Sit on a bicycle's blocking.  Max B.  Anthony.  I'd like to kick his ass.  102-7-W-N.  Uh, 2-1-2-7-5-7. 
[00:43:00]  1-0-2-7 Anthony.  Yes.  Why don't we go right to Uncle John and see what he has.  Uncle John, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I learned a couple of things tonight.  Yeah.  I learned nothing by Opiole for the weekend,  if you might stay for a year and a half.  Yeah.  That's a good story.  Yeah, I just lost my mother-in-law.  Cool.  Oh, my God, I did it twice.  Yeah.  I also learned...  Hold on, hold on. 
[00:43:30]  We've got to back up a bit.  I did it twice.  When we first went up to Boston,  we were staying with my mother-in-law for...  Like, I stayed there a few weeks, maybe.  Yeah.  Barely.  Maybe two weeks.  And moved right out.  Right.  Opiole stayed there how long?  It's now.  And Opiole and my mother-in-law living in the house for how long?  I lived with your mother-in-law for nine to ten months.  Nine to ten months. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Not trying to squeeze you for alimony?  The house just from hell.  And he was breaking stuff.  Oh.  Like, you are terrible.  You broke this little...  No, I'm not as...  But I'm not as angry anymore, man.  I'm okay now.  Is that it?  No, you...  Like, you would just be clumsy.  Yeah.  You pulled the phone cord and it hit this little figurine and broke.  Her phone cord was 40 to 50 feet long,  which is very dangerous in an older lady's house  because they have all those trinkets around. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, Jesus Christ, Rick.  Did you see her naked?  Oh, gee, I'm feeling a little lonely.  Get me the grano-yay and squats.  You did see her naked.  Oh, did you see her naked?  Oh, yeah, okay, yes.  I'll play along.  I saw Anthony's ex-mobile on naked.  Oh, of course I did.  Get me my squats. 
[00:45:00]  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  But we're hanging out and Jay's here and Opie and Sandy  and we're all, you know, hanging out.  We're in the restaurant and it's very early and we want to have...  I want to go home now.  I want to go home.  We'd make plans to go out and I'm like, yeah, cool, we'll go out and stuff.  And then Jan would say, oh, let's take mom.  I'm like, no, I don't.  I really, you know, it's just us hanging out.  Fine. 
[00:45:30]  Fine.  Fine.  Oh, my God.  Why do we have to take mom every time?  I just want to go out and hang out with everybody and have a good time  and now we've got to take mom?  Fine.  You know, she doesn't ask for much.  You know, this happened and this and this and this and a whole laundry list of crap.  That's the reason why we should take, you know, something.  Fine.  Fine.  We've got to leave right now.  I just want to go.  Thank you for taking me, Anthony.  Thank you for going out to dinner. 
[00:46:00]  This is a lot of fun.  Okay, great.  And now we're into it.  I'll take another scotch.  I'll take a scotch.  An hour and 15 minutes into it.  I want to go home.  Jen, could you tell your mom that we're still hanging?  I'm having fun.  I'm hanging out with Jay and Opie and we're laughing our balls off and stuff.  I want to go home.  Okay, Opie, Jay, bye. 
[00:46:30]  No, yeah, it was a lot of fun hanging out.  But now I've got to take a drunken mother-in-law home.  Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!  The best, though, is she would pass out on our buddy Jay's shoulder on the way home.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Pass out on poor Jay's shoulder.  Or lap.  She would.  Her head would be right in Jay's shoulder.  No, it's not even a joke.  She'd pass out.  Right.  She'd pass out right there.  I, uh... 
[00:47:00]  I want to go home.  Now we're having fun.  No, we weren't.  Oh, my God.  Sorry.  Was I getting, uh, into something?  Well, who am I to say?  I'll be giving you up my con.  I'll be touching my dirty spot.  You have gone too far.  You have gone too far.  I don't know how you did it. 
[00:47:30]  I don't know how you'd stay there for that long.  Doug, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  I hope it was Anthony's ex-motherland  the reason you sold your pants that night  going into the bar?  That was years before I was there.  Later, dude.  Have a good trip.  And then how about when the goddamn dog died?  Goddamn dog death dedication.  When the goddamn dog died  and she put the ashes in the urn  and put it up on the, in the living room.  Well, just like, uh, from Meet the Parents. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  I was creeped out every time.  Here's the dead dog.  And when I die, I want my ashes put together with chesters  and we're going to be buried together.  I want to go home.  I'm having fun.  I want to go home.  Oh, my, believe me.  It was like, you know,  because I like to pace myself  and have a good time, especially,  let me tell you,  especially when it's me, Opie, and Jay 
[00:48:30]  hanging out  because we would laugh so hard  and come up with all this off-the-wall fun stuff.  Worked great for the show.  And, um,  I'd be just getting started.  I gotta go home now.  I gotta go home.  Son of a mother F, bitch.  And there we were,  going home.  At like 10, 15.  Because you know why?  You know why?  You could email or call and say,  you know,  why didn't you not be a pussy and go,  because if I didn't go home right then and there, 
[00:49:00]  it would just be worse.  It'd be worse.  If Mom didn't get to go,  worse.  I'd listen,  I'd hear it all night  from the ex,  all night.  Why couldn't Mom go?  Ugh.  Jesus.  What, am I getting ahead of myself again?  Oh, what?  What, Opie?  No,  we ended our radio show hours ago,  and it's just you and I  in our office. 
[00:49:30]  Opie,  am I a leg smooth?  I just lost him.  Oh, come on.  It's all in fun.  She was very nice to me.  Of course she was.  Yes.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Opie,  if you don't want to talk to me anymore,  that's fine.  We live here for nine months.  We, you,  and Chester's ashes.  And if you don't want to call me,  fine.  I'm not going to take you. 
[00:50:00]  Come here,  Chester.  Get the urn.  I'll pet the urn  until I die.  And then we mix the ashes  and me and Chester go  go to eternity together.  Opie,  if you're in that effing bar,  if you're in that effing bar,  I'm not going to chase you.  We had a great relationship.  You lived here for nine months.  Me,  you're in Chester.  Come here,  Chester.  I know you can't walk anymore.  I'll put you on wheels.  Say hi to Chester. 
[00:50:30]  Chester walked just fine.  Chester,  every,  oh my God,  we got to eat there?  Come over.  I'm making turkey.  All right.  Coming over for dinner.  This dog was so effing spoiled,  rotten.  You'd sit there,  and she didn't care.  The goddamn dog  could jump up on the plate  and start eating out of her plate,  and she'd be like,  look at how cute Chester is.  And I'm sitting there like,  if that dog comes near me,  I swear to God, 
[00:51:00]  I am going to smack it in the nose.  And it would sit there.  This is where you get  the entire time you're eating.  Picture it.  Picture it the whole time.  But Anthony,  you're missing one sound.  What?  Oh yeah.  And why did it make that sound?  That was when you kick it  under the table  because it's after your food.  You'd have to give it a smack. 
[00:51:30]  Smack that Chester.  And just try,  the whole time,  for an hour.  Anthony,  if you're going to the fridge,  could you get me  a glass of wine  out of the box?  The box wine  is the best wine.  It's the cheapest.  Make me a Captain Morgan.  Captain,  Captain and a Coke  with a chest of lime  and my box wine  and some squash  and some crummy eggs.  And now I want to go home.  You are home.  Oh.  I want to go out. 
[00:52:00]  Unbelievable.  Look man,  I don't know this guy.  What?  What?  I just came in  to do a radio.  What happened?  I don't want to be called it.  I'm not able to unleash.  I can unleash.  I'm pegging enough.  I should be able  to talk about it.  That's right.  It's pegging enough  and have the cheese.  You think you want  some cheese, Chester?  Hey, uh, 
[00:52:30]  Anthony,  I got a little job for you.  When you come up,  could you install  a new garage door  and garage door opener?  It's my weekend.  I swear to God,  it was a mission  every weekend.  When I was living  in New York  doing construction,  and I'd come up  for Christmas vacation  or something,  believe me,  for me,  a vacation was great.  Now it's like,  you know,  this is vacation.  It's nice to get away,  but it's not like  we're working here.  When I was working,  vacations were cherished.  Cherished. 
[00:53:00]  Every Christmas,  there we are,  going up to Boston  where I would have to do  some type of construction work  around the house  because that was it.  Could you install  an air-conditioning vent  into my den?  Oh, my God.  You know,  Jennifer,  why do I have to go  and do the work I do?  This is what I do.  I install air-conditioning  on my vacation.  God damn it.  My mother doesn't ask  for a lot.  Oh!  Could you knock 
[00:53:30]  this wall down  and put it in a box?  Could you pick up  Aunty Mog?  Up Anonymous,  Aunty Mog.  She's dead, eh?  Remember the Aunty Mog stories?  I used to love her.  She's now dead.  Aunty Mog.  Aunty Mog was actually  pretty cool.  Phew.  Learned Anthony  needs to see a doctor.  What?  Just talking.  What?  People are looking  at me all horrified.  People are turning  down their radio.  I want to go home. 
[00:54:00]  Just taking a little listen.  It's about time.  It's what I've been thinking.  Who are you hiring?  I'm wearing a Chester.  To the Oaskas.  It's Chester.  Damn.  You're wearing a Chester  Hill figure.  It's wonderful.  Love the great folk.  How long have I been here? 
[00:54:30]  Two minutes.  That seems like an hour.  Huh?  What?  Oh, nothing.  Listen, I'm just sitting  back listening like  everyone else.  Could you install  a garage door opener?  Yeah, okay.  What's that?  What's that take?  Go to C.S.  Go to the mall in 
[00:55:00]  Birmingham.  Pick up a garage door  opener and install it.  Great.  It's my vacation.  Cool.  Cool.  What am I going to do  on vacation?  Let me drive all the way  to Massachusetts  to put in a garage  door opener.  This is great.  I'm enjoying  the hell out of myself.  Could you install  a tap in the wall  for my box of wine?  Box of wine.  Box.  Oh, my God.  And then once Jen  got that job  at the liquor store,  whoo-hoo,  a discount.  I could step up  to the public  box of wine. 
[00:55:30]  It's like,  gee,  Mom's in again.  I want to go home.  Can I?  What?  You were there.  You were there  for the whole thing,  Opie.  Don't look so shocked.  No, I want to remind  you of something.  Oh, no.  What?  We'll be back.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:56:00]  I remember that.  Thanks for that, Opie.  That little tidbit.  I don't know  how I blocked it out  because it was  a nightly occurrence.  There I am  starting a brand new  career in radio.  Thanks to who?  Really trying.  Opie.  Who?  Who?  Opie.  What?  That's right. 
[00:56:30]  Opie.  Okay.  Absolutely.  You should get  a divorce from me.  I would not  elect to stand on.  And every friggin'  night,  I get the call  from the house  because the both  of them,  sitting there,  you know,  having some cocktails,  having a couple  of cocktails,  some mother-daughter  cocktails.  Totally  like tanked.  And I get the,  I get the phone  call. 
[00:57:00]  Come pick me up.  Where are you?  I'm in mom's house.  I'm in my house  and they bring  another box of wine.  And I would have to drive  to the mother's house  because she wouldn't  drive Jennifer home  for some reason.  You had to pass  your house.  Yeah.  I had to pass my house.  Meanwhile,  she,  the mother would pick  up Jennifer  from the liquor store  and instead of driving  her home,  would drive her  to her house. 
[00:57:30]  Drop her up.  You know why?  I want to go home  because going there  to pick her up  is never going  to pick her up.  Sit down  and have a cocktail.  Pet me in the chest  is in.  Say hello.  Hello.  And I'd have to sit there.  But thank God  something good  was on TV.  They would tape  General Hospital  and then watch it  once I got there  for some reason.  Like because  Jennifer would have  gotten home  and the mother  taped the soap opera  so Jennifer could watch it. 
[00:58:00]  But they had  something else to watch  until like 7 o'clock  or 7.30  when I got there.  All right.  We're going to watch  the soap opera.  Get me  because you've got  a box of wine.  Get me a squatch.  Oh my God.  I love that John Black.  Stefano Jumeirah  is a scumbag.  What?  No, no.  What's the matter?  Why am I being  looked at so strangely?  Anthony's lawyer checking  and stop Anthony.  Stop now.  Tony! 
[00:58:30]  God damn,  you guys are messed up.  And I feel your pain.  Oof.  I don't feel any pain.  No kidding,  you box wine drinking hobo.  But I want to go home.  It's like the new ant.  He's starting to...  Oh yeah,  the new ant.  To blow off steam.  It's therapy.  It is therapy.  Well,  I was fine  with leaving it alone.  But you're doing  like soliloquies.  I mean,  when you get into this...  When he gets into this,  though,  it's like,  it's not a conversation.  You just sit back  and listen  until he's done.  Okay,  here he goes again.  He's off and running. 
[00:59:00]  But I had completely  blocked out  the time  we were flying  from Boston  to Los Angeles.  Los Angeles,  right.  At this time,  the significant others  were still in New York.  We were living  at my mother-in-law's house.  Correct.  And Opie has to remind me  that for a 10-minute drive,  we needed a lift  to what is called  the Logan Shuttle.  It's a bus.  We wanted a ride  to Logan Airport,  which was 45 minutes away. 
[00:59:30]  I can't drive to Logan.  I don't like driving  all the way to the airport.  Don't like it.  I want to stay home.  But we're begging  because we don't know  the area yet.  Right.  We don't know nothing  of the area.  So she said  she'll drop us off  at the Logan Shuttle.  The Logan Express  is a bus  that'll take you  to the airport.  It's a few minutes away.  So we all get in the car  and she drives,  which later on,  after we had lived there  a while,  we realized 
[01:00:00]  where she was taking us  was probably  a 10-minute drive.  Tops.  You get on a road,  you get on another road,  and you're there.  It took us  about 45 minutes  to get to this place  because I had forgotten  I had blocked this out  whenever the mother-in-law  would take us anywhere.  I can't make left turn.  I can't make a left turn.  But three rights  makes a left.  And I always  take the side streets. 
[01:00:30]  I always take  the back roads  because I don't like  the highways.  Highways?  It's Route 9  if you're ever familiar  with Boston.  It's not,  it's not,  it's like Jericho Turnpike  on the island.  It's not,  I can't take lefts.  She's afraid.  I'm afraid  to make left turn turns.  Afraid.  So we sat there  on this  Mr. Toad's wild ride  through the backwoods  of suburban Massachusetts.  When we realized  later on  this is a 10 minute drive  and she's driving us  you know  to the Logan shop  because I can't drive 
[01:01:00]  to the airport.  We were almost,  we almost missed our flight.  Remember that?  Mm-hmm.  I can't,  I choose not  to make left turn turns.  But even better,  remember when you had  to go to Annie Marks?  Annie Marks.  That was the best story  that you told  at lunch today.  To this day  I couldn't tell you  how to get there  because it was this maze thing.  She should drive  for the mob  when you're trying  to take a prisoner  to the camp.  You wouldn't even  have to blindfold them.  I couldn't remember  where we were.  We'd be driving 
[01:01:30]  down these back roads  and, you know,  I'd be driving  in my car.  She's in the back seat  going,  all right,  make a left here.  Now turn,  make a right.  I don't know  how to make the left  so we're just going  to take the way I take  which is a bunch  of right hands-ins.  Make a right,  make a right  and I'm driving  in circles  during this way  and later  after living there a while  I realized,  again,  had to be  a five-minute drive.  Five-minute drive.  It took  a half hour.  But the funny part 
[01:02:00]  about that story,  she wasn't driving,  you were driving,  she was giving directions  with all right turns.  I don't even like  being in the car  during left hand turns.  And she finally told you  that the reason,  yeah,  she went that way  was because she doesn't  like left hand turns.  And she didn't know  how to get there.  Dude,  she did not know  how to get there  telling me  how to get there  by making left turns  because she never had done it.  So I'm like,  why are we making a right?  I know it's got to be this way  because the town  that we were going to  is that way.  Well, Anthony,  make a right.  Okay,  go up,  make a right. 
[01:02:30]  Now make this right.  Three rights.  Three rights.  Three rights.  Make a left.  Three rights.  Make a left.  That's my squatch.  Get the books away.  Unbelievable.  Thank you for refreshing my memory.  I'm sure you'll come up  with a bunch more, Opie.  Opie remembers.  He takes pleasure  in saying his aunt  remember this time  Judy did this.  I'm like,  ah,  I blocked it off.  Bill,  what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I got a guy that works with us  that does not make left turns 
[01:03:00]  and he's a service tech.  He drives all day long  on the island  and when he goes into Manhattan  he's a total nightmare.  He just keeps going  right and right  and right and right  to get back.  So he doesn't make lefts either?  No,  not at all.  He's like petrified of it.  It's crazy.  Huh.  And when anybody else  drives with him  it makes sense  not driving with him.  You'd have to be  a goddamn lunatic  to make a left on tin.  I stick to rights  because then I only  got to look one way.  It's a right tin.  Your brother wants in on this. 
[01:03:30]  Joe.  Hey, Joe.  Jack Cook.  And what about the time  that we played up at,  I forget the name of the place.  Oh, God.  We were playing  and you had to take the van  that we moved the equipment in  to take her home.  Dude,  that was an  I want to go home story.  Oh, get this.  Rotgut's playing.  We live down in New York.  We got a gig up in Boston.  Kind of exciting  and fun for a band.  So,  Judy wants to go.  I want to go 
[01:04:00]  and see Rotgut.  So,  so,  all right.  We pile in.  She drives  with one of her friends.  Not with us.  She gets there.  Her friend leaves her there.  Because Judy goes,  I want to stay  and watch the band.  So,  the friend leaves.  End of the night comes.  We just get done with the set.  I want to hang out.  I want to go home.  Like,  you want to hang with the band?  We're having a good time.  We're up in Boston.  This is kick ass.  I want to go home.  I go to my brother, Joe. 
[01:04:30]  I got to take the van.  The equipment's going to be loaded in shortly.  Just move the equipment off the stage  and I will be right back.  I am just taking Judy home.  I know nothing of the area.  Judy's going to give me directions  on how to get from Boston,  the club,  to about 20 miles  in the suburbs  to her house.  I was lost.  So lost.  She's drunk off her ass  on the front seat.  And I'm looking at my watch going,  the band thinks I'm dead  because I got to be dead.  Oh, yeah.  We definitely thought 
[01:05:00]  you got to take some kind of  horrible disfiguring action.  The equipment now  is being either locked  in the club  for the night  or moved out into the snow.  Where the band's got  nowhere to load the equipment  as I'm driving Judy around.  Now the truck's running out of gas.  Judy, where's the gas station?  I don't know.  I got to go home.  I know where this one is.  I'm flying.  And she's flopping  all over the seat.  Dude, I was getting so pissed.  I started jamming on the brakes  just to watch her flop  into the footwell  and then, like,  pull her back up 
[01:05:30]  on the seat.  Do you have any idea  where we are?  Um, no,  this doesn't look familiar.  Finally,  finally,  get her home.  I swear,  I just about  slowed the van down  and pushed her out  in front of the house.  Got back  maybe two  or two and a half hours  after I left  with...  It was supposed to be...  It was supposed to be  maybe a 45 to 50 minute trip,  like an hour top  round trip.  Two and a half hours later, 
[01:06:00]  I come back to a band  that wanted to  effing kill me.  It was closer  to three and a half hours.  Yeah.  They wanted to kill me.  I thought for sure  you got,  you know,  you had an accident.  Yeah.  And there's Judy,  90 pounds,  soaking wet,  flopping around  the cab of this truck,  hammered.  I don't know,  what road are we on?  Now,  here's your mistake,  you made a left turn.  You made a mistake  because you made  a left turn.  Yeah.  Yeah,  we moved the stuff  out into the street  that night. 
[01:06:30]  Anthony,  what are we going  to do about this?  In the seat.  Where are we?  I have no clue  where we are,  Judy.  You have to look around.  Tell me which way to go.  We are on Route 9  somewhere in Natick.  Natick?  I know a great place  for fried clams  and steamers  right up the road.  Judy,  it's three in the morning.  Oh,  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  Can we stop  and get a box of wine?  I swear to God. 
[01:07:00]  So when I finally  got back,  yeah,  the guys were  fuming and pissed,  but that right there  is an example  of I want to go home.  I want to go home.  Thanks for the reminder,  Joe.  All right, man.  Take it easy.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  Steve,  what's going on?  It's N.E.W.  How you doing, guys?  Good.  Opie,  wasn't there a situation  at the mother-in-law's house  about a painting  or a poster?  Where she took  my picture down  because...  Yeah,  that was it.  That was it.  Oh,  there was the picture  of the Demented World cover. 
[01:07:30]  Right.  That's right.  That she had up on the wall  and then when...  Probably displayed.  The marriage went on the fritz.  She was like...  I just feel bad  that I also have  to get rid of Opie.  A picture of Opie.  So they're together.  So, yeah,  she felt kind of bad  about that.  Did she like Opie  better than you?  Well,  she probably does now.  I'll tell you that one.  She could have just  cut you out  of the Demented World picture  and kept it hanging.  There you go.  Take care, guys.  All right, Steve.  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  Cool.  I want to go home.  All right,  why don't we take a break? 
[01:08:00]  Yes.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We'll be back  in just a bit.  Opie has  that's a new show.  Syndication now,  you're first.  Syndication when O.J.  finds a real killer.  Syndication now,  you're first.  Syndication when Earl  won't hard  to a cigarette stop.  Syndication now,  you're first.  Syndication when  syndication lines  are funny again.  Hey,  this is Sandy.  Syndication when Opie  puts a ring on my finger.  My wife is not born yet.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W. 
[01:08:30]  It's ONA.  Anthony's very excited.  I know.  He's a friend of the show.  We haven't talked to him  in a couple of years.  It's been a while.  It's the legendary  Buddy Epstein,  who I believe  is 92 years old now,  Anthony.  All right.  Let's say hi to Buddy.  Buddy!  Yeah, yeah.  Buddy Epstein.  Hello? 
[01:09:00]  How are you doing, Buddy?  Hello,  this is Opie or Anthony?  Both.  Both of us, sir.  Opie and Anthony  on the phone  at the same time.  Oh,  at the same time,  at the same phone?  How about that technology?  Oh,  that's really good.  Isn't that great?  Yeah.  Now, Buddy,  we haven't talked to you  in a couple of years.  great to see,  well,  you're still around.  That's good.  I'm not only around,  but I'm still,  you know,  doing things,  like,  you know, 
[01:09:30]  creating something.  I see that.  Last time we talked to you,  you were about painting.  You're still doing the painting?  Painting,  and you,  are you,  I feel like I'm not  fully connected here.  Yeah,  I'm getting that, too.  Are you getting a full voice?  Oh,  the sound?  Yeah.  How's this?  Is this better,  Buddy?  That's a little,  a little better,  but it seems to cut out  when,  when I talk.  How's this,  Buddy?  Uh,  I,  Is that better? 
[01:10:00]  Yeah,  yeah,  let me,  let me try another hearing aid.  I've got over here,  like,  like,  Yeah,  pop another hearing aid in.  Talk to each other  for a moment.  All right,  pop another hearing aid in,  Buddy?  Opie,  Buddy?  Oh,  I don't,  yeah,  there we go.  Opie,  um,  Buddy's going to try another hearing aid.  Buddy's going to pop in another hearing aid,  and tell us all about what he's working on now.  What's that?  What,  Buddy?  Buddy?  Uh,  he's just,  he's still,  he,  I think he said it'll be another minute. 
[01:10:30]  Oh,  Buddy!  Yeah!  That's what happens when,  you know,  when,  when you're,  when you're 92,  you know,  you have to,  things happen to you,  like,  when you see a pretty girl walking by,  and the pacemaker starts to open the garage door,  and then,  you know,  things happen.  Buddy,  how many electronics do you have on you?  Any,  uh,  electronics?  Yeah,  what do you got,  the hearing aid,  you got a pacemaker?  I have a pacemaker,  and the hearing aids.  But I,  you're not cutting out now. 
[01:11:00]  That's not too bad.  Uh,  last time we talked to Buddy Epson,  he was,  um,  uh,  entering the internet.  Yes,  you had the,  uh,  BuddyEpson.com website?  Oh,  yeah,  well,  now we're selling a book  on BuddyEpson.com,  and also,  on,  um,  um,  let's see,  uh,  firstbooks.  Yeah.  Firstbooks.com.  Okay.  And also,  the,  uh,  Barnes & Noble,  which is a bricks and mortar bookstore.  Buddy remembers when the wagon used to come around with the books. 
[01:11:30]  Uh,  wagon used to come around with the books.  I don't quite remember.  I wasn't in the book business.  Hey,  uh,  Buddy,  what's the name of your book?  Uh,  Kelly's Quest.  You know,  they did this very strange thing,  how it happened.  I mean,  I was in show business for 75 years.  Yes.  I thought I was just,  you know,  entertaining folks.  Uh,  but,  uh,  I didn't realize I was gathering material for a novel.  Yeah,  you had enough material for a,  for a novel. 
[01:12:00]  Sure.  What?  That's what happened.  One day I was inspired.  I walked on a set of,  uh,  Bobby Jones,  and it was very busy as usual,  and there were a bunch of very,  very efficient,  uh,  a crew.  And there were,  among them,  there was one girl.  One girl.  And she was beautiful.  Uh-huh.  But she was a stagehand.  I mean,  she had,  uh,  done the reason,  uh,  and,  uh,  the,  the tool belt.  And she was doing her job in such a way that nobody could find fault with her. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  And she fascinated me.  And so,  I wrote a novel about her.  You,  you were all like hot on this girl.  I,  well,  I was just curious.  You were a,  you were like a kid of,  of,  uh,  65 back then too,  right?  Buddy?  It's difficult,  difficult to convince my wife  that,  uh,  I didn't have a romantic.  A threesome.  Hey,  buddy,  buddy.  Huh?  Uh,  did you,  uh,  want to,  you know,  uh,  have some of that sex with this Kelly girl?  Well, 
[01:13:00]  uh,  yeah,  secondarily,  first of all,  I was interested in her life.  In her life?  Okay.  Yeah,  and so,  Hey,  you don't have to tell us.  I put together the rest of her story.  Yeah.  And it turned out to be Kelly's question.  What she did is,  is looking for a man,  uh,  you're looking for Mr. Wright.  You know who Mr. Wright is?  Oh.  You know,  whatever girl's looking for,  a guy that,  uh,  she would,  uh,  you know,  like her to be the father of her children. 
[01:13:30]  Now,  Buddy.  Yeah.  Did that,  uh,  young,  uh,  whippersnapper that played,  uh,  Jedediah Jones?  Uh,  well,  I don't know what happened to him.  Did he get Kelly?  Uh,  no,  no.  Well,  he disappeared.  He sure did.  He's,  he's off the scope,  so I don't know what happened to him.  I try,  you know,  he has no forwarding address,  nothing.  Goddamn,  that was a great show.  He disappeared.  Barnaby Jones.  Yeah,  can we get a Barnaby Jones line out of you there,  buddy?  The what?  Can you say something from,  uh,  Barnaby Jones for us? 
[01:14:00]  Something from Barnaby Jones.  Yeah,  we like when you recite some dialogue from the old show there.  Good evening,  ma'am.  My name is Barnaby Jones.  I understand.  Barnaby Jones went out to buy the evening paper one night,  ten years ago,  and you want me to find him?  Because his supper's getting cold.  You got enough?  That's enough,  buddy,  but you know something?  You know what I want to hear?  Now,  this is obviously from the classic show,  the Beverly Hillbillies,  which everyone has just grown to love you from,  and,  uh,  I,  I gotta hear  your famous line. 
[01:14:30]  Here it comes,  though.  The well doggy.  Yeah,  you wanna hear that?  Yeah,  let's hear it.  That's two words,  though.  It certainly is.  You ready?  Yeah.  Well  doggy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  You know,  everyone's been waiting for that,  buddy.  The what?  Everyone's been waiting to hear you do the well doggy.  Well,  I tell you what,  I'm thinking of doing it,  but I'm thinking of putting it on a watch.  On a watch? 
[01:15:00]  And then,  like,  every hour,  it'll go well doggy?  You think it'll go well?  Hey,  you didn't pop a vocal cord,  did you?  I didn't.  No,  but my voice is a little off today.  Oh,  yeah.  Well,  you're busy now.  You got a book out,  and,  uh,  you're doing a lot of press for the book.  Sure.  You're talking a lot.  Can we,  I'm really talking too much.  Hey,  can we see,  can we hear the well doggy one more time?  Yeah,  I love that one.  One more time.  If you hear too much,  I get tired of it.  No,  no,  I've been hearing that since,  uh,  I was a kid. 
[01:15:30]  All right.  Um,  Hey,  this is the last time for well doggy,  but it's,  uh,  there are two of you there.  This is one for each one.  All right.  Here we go.  Doggy.  Yeah.  Okay.  Buddy.  Buddy.  This is such fun the second time,  so I will let you know it once.  No,  I think that was better than the first one.  Hey,  uh,  buddy,  we're hearing that,  um,  you have like,  uh,  a song parody.  You do a little something to the Beverly Hillbillies theme.  Uh,  something from the Beverly Hillbillies theme. 
[01:16:00]  Let me see.  Supposedly he has reworked the song.  Oh,  really?  You kind of,  uh,  rewrote some of the words or something?  Oh,  uh,  come and listen to the story about a man named,  uh,  the poor montaneer,  barely kept his family fed.  And that's it,  wasn't it?  And then,  uh,  and then one day,  oh,  he,  uh,  but he,  he never,  when I,  when I,  when I'm still writing it,  when people,  I'm sorry.  Uh, 
[01:16:30]  uh,  you shouldn't have asked me,  but that was,  yeah,  no,  we got,  yeah,  that's okay.  That's all right.  We were,  what the hell?  We were told that,  uh,  you had,  uh,  you worked up,  worked up a little ditty.  Now,  buddy,  you remember,  um,  Miss Hathaway from the,  yeah,  now,  uh,  was she,  wonderful actress.  Yeah,  she was,  of course,  she was in a lot of,  uh,  things back in the sixties and,  uh,  and the seventies and whatnot.  Now,  was she,  um,  you know,  you know what I mean, 
[01:17:00]  right?  I don't know what you mean.  You know what I mean.  Was she,  did she,  did she like some of,  did she like Kelly also?  Uh,  would she have liked Kelly?  Uh,  well,  I think they would have gotten along.  Yeah.  Huh?  But,  uh,  I wouldn't say that,  uh,  I think she was a guy.  They were not,  uh,  they were not similar personalities,  I would say.  I,  I,  I'm,  I'm guessing Miss Hathaway,  carpet muncher.  You know what I mean?  She what?  I'm thinking she was a,  a carpet muncher. 
[01:17:30]  You know what that is,  buddy?  A carpet muncher?  A carpet muncher.  A vegetarian.  You know what I mean?  Uh,  you know,  they're kind of into the girls.  I don't know.  You're speaking another language.  We are.  Uh,  you know,  kind of like,  uh,  into girls more than guys.  Uh,  you know?  She's like digging for the pearl.  I never investigated that possibility,  but,  uh,  um,  she was a nice lady,  and she acted well,  and that's all that,  that,  uh,  you know,  it was as far as I went in investigating.  Ah,  you talked to Max at all? 
[01:18:00]  Max,  of course.  What do you mean I've talked to him?  I say,  hello,  Max,  and I shut up for 20 minutes,  because he keeps coming.  He doesn't shut up,  huh?  Uh,  you know,  he's a wonderful guy.  Jethro.  I should never have given him a set of dominoes for Christmas.  Dominoes?  Yeah,  he just saw them in half-sit and rolled,  and look what happened.  He just built in a,  some kind of a gambling casino.  Oh,  is that what he's doing?  Yeah.  A Jethro gambling casino?  Yeah.  Uncle Jed,  Uncle Jed,  I'm going to make me a casino.  I can see it, 
[01:18:30]  it sounds like one of his little schemes that he was always trying to do.  I'm going to be a double-naught spy.  It's one of my favorites.  Yeah,  I can see you're fans of his,  and it's,  and properly,  so he's a wonderful guy.  Well,  let me tell you,  a big fan of the Beverly Hillbillies.  I always enjoyed that.  And now you're a novelist,  which,  you know,  92 years old.  It depends,  and it depends on how many people buy the book.  So I want you guys to get busy,  and plug it,  please.  I'm going to go out on the street with a cart and sell it myself,  buddy.  Stay right on the machine. 
[01:19:00]  The machine.  You can get Buddy's book through his website,  buddyepson.com,  is there anything else on the website,  Buddy?  I don't know.  You might find some other stuff on there.  But that's just the thing that I want to plug right now.  All right.  There's none of that porno on your website?  No.  There's no porno on there.  Yeah,  that's why I thought...  Porno was a thing of the past.  You have to get to the real story now.  And I got on Kelly's Quest.  All right.  Very good.  Buddy Epson, 
[01:19:30]  thank you so much for coming on the air with us again.  You're very welcome,  and I enjoyed it.  Thank you.  And we look forward to talking to you again.  Bye.  Thank you,  buddy.  Anytime.  Thanks,  buddy.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  The great Buddy Epson.  There goes Buddy Epson.  He's a novelist.  Go to BuddyEpson.com.  Oh, my God.  Well,  you know,  I thought last time we talked to him was a little,  you know,  rough.  Well,  now we've got to compare.  Well,  yeah.  Rick,  can you,  Rick,  please get those two. 
[01:20:00]  Also,  isolate the clip of him saying carpet muncher,  because that is...  Carpet muncher.  When he said that,  I got a carpet muncher.  He goes,  Carpet muncher.  What is a carpet muncher?  I think we found a new sound.  Hey,  Carpet muncher.  Yeah.  Poor Buddy.  Well,  you know something?  If you could even do that at 92.  God bless him.  And write a book and...  God bless him.  What not.  Definitely.  Him trying to sing the song.  How uncomfortable was everybody? 
[01:20:30]  It was Chris Radio at his best.  I was trying to shut up,  but then when it got silent,  I had to jump in and say something.  I was like,  well,  I'm really uncomfortable here, buddy.  Let's go to Pete.  Pete,  what's going on?  Congratulations, boys.  I'm getting the last interview  with Buddy F.  No.  Stop it.  I haven't had to hang up on Pete.  Stop it.  That's not nice.  Come on, Pete.  He's fine.  We said that last time,  and that was two years ago.  He's still kicking.  Jay,  what's going on?  Guys,  you guys have to be careful.  I think that's considered elder abuse. 
[01:21:00]  I'm not for sure.  We were very nice to Buddy F.  Hey.  Well,  you know,  and Buddy's publicist told us  that he sings a good version  of the theme song.  Yeah.  I don't know who the publicist  was thinking about.  Maybe back in 1974.  I don't know why he...  He specifically wrote it in a note  when he sent the book over.  He says,  Hey,  Buddy has this great parody  that he does to Beverly Hillbill.  He says,  Have him sing it.  He does it all the time.  This is a jazz of poetry.  Well,  the other part of that  was the thing  and then 
[01:21:30]  I wish you didn't ask me that.  Oh,  my buddy.  We leave you  with the sounds  of Buddy Epson.  Buddy used to be  very healthy  and vibrant.  Heard his voice.  Sounded just like it did  on the Beverly Hillbillies.  Now it sounds like  a combination of  a modem  and tires  squealing on a road. 
[01:22:00]  That's close.  Yeah,  it's really,  really deteriorated.  The poor guy.  All right,  Anthony,  why don't we start  with Buddy Epson  saying carpet muncher.  Ah,  all right.  Here it is.  A carpet muncher.  A guy remuncher.  A carpet muncher.  A carpet muncher.  Can I have some  Sandy Kane sounds?  Did you ever think  you'd hear Buddy Epson  say carpet muncher?  That's the weird thing 
[01:22:30]  that I like  of this show.  I smell bit.  Ah,  ah,  ah.  I smell a Sandy Kane  Buddy Epson remix.  Oh!  A carpet muncher.  Ah,  ah,  ah.  A carpet muncher.  Ah!  A carpet muncher.  I don't believe it.  A carpet muncher.  Oh,  oh.  All right,  that's carpet muncher.  You got me,  man.  Here's Buddy Epson  doing a famous line  from Barnaby Jones.  Good evening,  ma'am.  My name is Barnaby Jones.  I understand  you husband went out 
[01:23:00]  to buy the evening paper  one night ten years ago  and you want me to find him  because his supper's getting cold.  Ah,  I don't remember that episode.  Good evening,  ma'am.  It's Barnaby Jones.  He was old then.  Remember you used to say,  wow,  look at Barnaby Jones.  He's like the geriatric gumshoe,  you know,  he's just kind of walking around.  He's an old guy  and that was back in like 74.  I was going to say  like 75.  25 years ago.  Hey,  Barnaby Jones.  Hello ma'am,  your husband left.  Oh wait,  I'm your husband?  Let me get my hearing aid, 
[01:23:30]  a different one.  Here's one that is  just tragic,  Buddy Epson  trying to sing  the Beverly Hillbillies theme song.  There's more of this,  though, right?  Yeah,  we're going to add to it,  but Rick was running  real fast to get this done  while we were in commercials.  Come and listen to the story  about a man named  a poor montaneer,  barely kept his family fed.  And then one day,  oh he,  but he never,  when I,  I'm still writing it, 
[01:24:00]  when people,  I'm sorry.  Oh my God,  the horror of getting old.  And then people say,  I don't know,  but then,  but I saw Jeannie in the room  and then you came back  and I don't know where she went  and it was there,  but now I made your nose  and it's gone.  It sounds,  a lot of people are saying  it sounds like Buddy said  crumpet muncher. 
[01:24:30]  Oh yeah,  that's what the phone call's about?  Yeah,  I was reading feedback.  That's all right.  Jay.  Yeah.  Hey.  Sounds like crumpet muncher to me.  Yeah.  Sounds like an English guy  or something.  Crumpet muncher?  Let's see that,  yeah.  A crumpet muncher?  A crumpet muncher?  A crumpet muncher?  It does sound like crumpet muncher.  A crumpet muncher?  Jose.  A crumpet muncher?  That doesn't even matter.  I'm just going to call Dykes  crumpet munchers now.  They're not going to know  what they have by me.  Got it.  Who's running to  opf3.com  to steal that screen name?  I'm crumpet muncher. 
[01:25:00]  I'm crumpet muncher.  A crumpet muncher?  Maybe the girls  he's been with lately.  A crumpet muncher?  Jose,  what's up?  What's up,  fellas?  Yeah,  I was going to say,  when he says,  I'm sorry,  he sounds so dejected,  like,  so defeated.  I got to hear it now.  I got to hear it now.  We got to add to this,  because then there's a line  where he goes,  maybe,  maybe you shouldn't have asked  to do it now.  Maybe you shouldn't have asked  to do it now.  Talk amongst yourselves. 
[01:25:30]  Let me try another hearing aid.  All right, here's the song again.  come and listen to the story  about a man named  a poor montaneer,  barely kept his family fed.  And then one day,  oh, he never,  when I,  I'm so writing it,  when people,  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Oh,  don't laugh at that.  That's crazy. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What happened,  Bill?  I was just talking.  Some guy put,  uh,  Buddy Epson's info  into deathclock.com,  and it came up,  he should have been dead  November 3rd,  92.  You're laughing out there.  That's not funny.  And you hear in the middle,  you're like,  I'm still writing it.  He said,  I'm still writing it.  All right,  let's compare the well doggies.  All right.  This is a very popular feature  on our show.  We've been doing this for years. 
[01:26:30]  Okay,  we have the first time  we ever talked to Buddy Epson  when he was 87 years old,  five years ago.  Here it is.  Well,  you hear that?  Not a crackle in there.  87.  87 years young.  Well,  something happened.  Well,  nice.  So his voice box.  Okay,  Anthony?  All right.  We fast forward to  when he was 90 years old.  Well, 
[01:27:00]  you hear the well?  It's all chewed up.  He almost gets the doggies out.  It's still all bashed up,  but...  Well,  doggies.  All right.  Why don't we compare?  87,  Rick?  87?  Well,  doggies.  Well,  doggies.  90 years old.  Yeah.  One more time.  87 years old?  Well,  doggies.  90 years old.  Well,  doggies.  All right,  kids,  hold on to your seat.  All right.  Okay. 
[01:27:30]  This is 92 years old.  What do you think?  Well,  doggies.  All right,  I got to go home.  What?  We got too far.  We got too far.  Oh,  no.  I got to go home.  Oh,  poor buddy.  Holy ass.  Oh,  that is,  that is horrible.  Now,  this is just a couple of years.  Let me give,  no,  let's go right back to 87 years old.  87 years old.  Well,  doggies.  90 years old. 
[01:28:00]  Well,  doggies.  92 years old.  Well,  doggies.  It's not even funny,  you ass.  We,  doggies.  And,  uh,  two years from now.  It gets gone higher and higher.  We,  bock,  bock,  bock,  bock,  bock,  bock,  doggies.  I need to hear that one more time. 
[01:28:30]  87 years old.  Well,  doggies.  90 years old.  Well,  doggies.  92 years old.  Well,  doggies.  That's my joker from Jersey.  When you guys asked him to say,  well,  doggie again,  I was waiting for him to say,  well,  I did it right the first time.  Get me a jury.  All right.  We better take a break.  Poor buddy.  That's awful.  God, 
[01:29:00]  age.  I want to,  I want to leave with,  uh,  the song.  Where did we go?  Cause I think,  uh,  oh,  you got it?  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  As we go to break,  Buddy Epson,  sing it.  Come and listen to the story  about a man named Jerry,  the poor montaneer,  barely kept his family.  And then one day,  oh,  he,  but he never,  when I,  I'm still writing it,  when people, 
[01:29:30]  I'm sorry.  Hugo.  After hearing that,  all I have to say is,  I hear dead people.  Okay.  Hugo,  cut it out.  Oh,  he's rocking.  Buddy Epson,  92.  God bless him.  All right.  We got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  212-757-1027.  Hour,  hour,  hour,  hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  Serving New Jersey,  Connecticut,  Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York. 
[01:30:00]  Nice second in,  uh,  from over here.  Night,  night,  baby.  Oh,  it's so nice.  Night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night.  I'm over here now.  Night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night, 
[01:30:30]  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  night,  I got your legs  All day, terrific  Don't just stare at it, eat it  Just look at me like a chick with bull 
[01:31:00]  He's a judge of six points, is he?  He's a scum bag  I see nice  I'm over here  I'm good like that, my friend  Look what we did to you again  With the Opie and Anthony show  Yes  Brian, what's up?  Are you two tools going to talk about Anthony's weight?  It's not even a good story  I forgot we kept teasing that 
[01:31:30]  You're a bigger tease than the Fox show about Temptation Island  I don't know, Ant's trying to get in shape  Don't make it sound like that  So it can look extra good for the TV show  Hurry up before I get out of range  All right, thank you, Brian  I'm not serious and I'm like  Yeah, I'm going to get all bumped  You know, I just think I could do with a little toning over it  So instead of getting one of those workout things like Cowbell Bill got  The workout, the body blade  The body blade that hit him in the nuts and the forehead at the same time 
[01:32:00]  The body blade, which amounts to a strip of steel  With a couple of, like, weights on either side of it  And you go, yai, yai, yai with the thing  You shake it back and forth  He did it in front of his face  Hit himself in the head and in the nuts  And then there's been, like, these workout machines  That are supposed to slide under the bed  And then they stay there  There's just so much of a pain in the ass  It pulls out easily  And sets up in seconds  And they never do  Why not join a gym?  Because my hours are very wacky  And it's very hard for me to go to a gym 
[01:32:30]  After the show  You know, I don't get home until 9 o'clock as it is  A lot of nights  What am I going to do?  Go to a gym and then come home  I'll be beat  And don't ask me to get up early  Anything like that  I don't want to go before the show  Because I'm going to be tired  You've got a home gym  I have a home gym  Like one of those big universals  I mean, I'm here and it's like full size  Like something you would see in a gym  Yeah  Yeah  Got all the things  All the features, Opie  For every part of your body 
[01:33:00]  Man  That's right  You've got enough places to hang everyone's coat  When you have  Coats when you have that next party  No, and that's the thing  Every workout machine  All these fads and trendy workout machines  Become coat racks  This thing is like a full set of  Goddamn monkey bars in my bedroom  Anthony, I'm going to tell you what's going to happen  Alright, go ahead, Opie  First of all, you set it up last night  Yeah, I was exhausted  After even setting the goddamn thing up  So officially you've had your first workout 
[01:33:30]  My first workout was actually lifting the plates  Up onto the rails that they ride on  And lowering them down  I was like, oh, God  My arm's killing me  That's funny  He said plates  All right  What, you think I should have just put one there  And put the rest in the closet?  Like Brian Regan would say  You're the one plate guy  Clang  Clang, clang, clang  Clang  Okay, Thunder  It's just something  First of all, it's always there  Every time I get up in the morning  Or I'm going to bed at night 
[01:34:00]  It's right there  Doesn't conveniently store anywhere  You do a few quick sets  As soon as you get up  There you go  I'll pump up for the show, Opie  And then it can't be covered up with coats  The thing's gigantic  Yeah, this is the music I play  Lickin' cool 
[01:34:30]  This is my credo, listen to him.  And Anthony, knowing our listeners, I'm sure no one is going to take your face and put 
[01:35:00]  him on, like, you know, muscle bodies on opanthony.com.  Making sick pics?  No, I don't think you'll see any of those.  You don't think so?  No, no.  Your head on a ripped body or anything?  No.  Quiet.  Here you guys.  Doug, what's going on?  What's up?  Say your prayers, eat your vitamins.  Anthony, did you just set arms coming to box two? 
[01:35:30]  Shut up, you jackass.  Well, Anthony, we've shared a lot on this show.  You just have to work out tight.  Well, here's words from my personal trainer.  Now we're having fun.  Now we're having fun.  Mike, what's up?  Your clothes, you come to me, now.  You should hire him to lift the weights for you.  Hello, cute and pie.  Hey, Mike, what do you have?  Oh, hey, listen, Anthony, who are you kidding?  You're kidding, man, if you're going to be a giant coat rack. 
[01:36:00]  A what?  A giant coat rack.  Oh, a giant coat rack.  If you're going to be a giant coat rack, bro.  Yeah, well, I'll tell you, it would be a giant one.  It's huge.  No, it's going to happen.  You'll be motivated for two weeks.  Yeah.  And you'll be a little sore, so you'll take a little time off.  Next thing you know, you're going to just be staring at this thing when you wake up in the morning.  No, no, no.  I'm starting on steroids.  How are you going to keep motivated?  I'm going to keep motivated.  My motivation is going to be keeping in shape in this music. 
[01:36:30]  That's it.  And it's right there.  Stares me in the face.  What the hell?  Not something that could be pulled into a closet somewhere.  What the hell happened to you, man?  What?  You're not the same guy.  You're changing.  I am not.  I'm the same ass wife I've always been.  I'm going to get all your friends together.  Oh, and have an intervention?  And we're going to have an intervention.  You son of a bitch.  What happened to your big 70s afro? 
[01:37:00]  What happened to the guy that would just drink until showtime?  Well, something never changed.  And then continue drinking after the show.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, Opie, I have certain responsibilities now to the program.  I'm an employee of two networks.  And I think I have a responsibility to people, to our fans and whatnot.  You guys got to see how smooth Anthony looks on that stage for XFL game day.  And I'm looking at Anthony in the back office going, I do not know that guy. 
[01:37:30]  Like, what the hell happened to you?  Let me tell you something.  I was crapping my pants.  You have changed so much.  Before we walked out.  The first night, and we had to go do stuff?  Yeah.  And I'm like, Ed, you know, this is a big meeting.  You know, they're looking to hire us in Boston, and they're going to fly us to L.A. and stuff.  So do you have anything that looks presentable?  I'll wear my unstained T-shirt today.  No, I can find one.  No joke. 
[01:38:00]  His wardrobe consisted of concert shirts.  Right.  And T-shirts with, like, alcohol products on them.  Yeah.  Yes.  And when we had a really important meeting, he would just make sure these shirts were ironed.  Ironed, yeah.  Yeah, so they wouldn't be ironed.  Am I lying?  No, I'll be here.  Probably right here.  We are going back a few years.  Oh, yeah.  I don't want people to think this happened yesterday.  No.  But that's the Anthony I remember from the beginning.  Yeah.  Now I'm looking at you.  We saw, you know, the show that's going to air Saturday at 730 on NBC. 
[01:38:30]  I'm like, I just, I don't recognize you.  Come on.  You've got, like, a personal fashion designer, I think.  Stylish.  You have a, you've called a girlfriend.  Like, a collared shirt on Anthony?  I know.  And now you're, now you're.  Nice.  She hooks me up.  And now you're working out?  Yeah, you know, I've got to try to get into a little bit better shape.  I'm not, look, I'm not unhappy with my body or anything. 
[01:39:00]  I'm not fat.  I'm not, but I could, I would like to get a little more toned.  Already?  Got to be the gooch, right?  Dry blood.  Dry blood.  Dry blood on opianthony.com.  Holy smoke.  I've taken Anthony's head and put it on one of these ripped bodies.  Look at your six-pack.  Yeah.  You're sporting a six-pack there.  That's my goal, Opie.  In the old days, you would be carrying the six-pack, but now you're, uh. 
[01:39:30]  Yes.  You're, you're sporting one.  Well, you know, as far as the TV show goes.  Someone's got to make a before and after show.  Yeah, thank you.  With a little beanpole or something.  You know, uh, I, I got to say, as far as the TV show goes.  Yeah.  Uh, it came from years.  See, when, what I was doing on the show was everything I had watched on television figures,  because that's the only reference point I had.  So I was using everything from what I saw on Ronan Martin's Laughing and any live variety show I had seen in my life. 
[01:40:00]  And that's who you saw.  Yeah.  Not me.  A collared shirt on Anthony is like an open wallet in Opie's hand.  That's from Dan from Oboe.  Ouch.  So keep us informed with your workout program.  I will let you know how, uh, how it goes.  Mm-hmm.  I'll let you know.  If you have, uh.  I'll keep you updated.  If you have this dedication toward the weights like you have toward your computer games.  Yeah.  Arnold Schwarzenegger, look out. 
[01:40:30]  You know, if I could just figure out a way to work out and play computer games at the same time.  If I could figure out how to put the game on pause so I could go and work out for a while.  True, yeah.  That's going to be your biggest challenge right there.  Hey, I'll do it tomorrow.  Right.  I'll start it tomorrow.  I'm so exhausted from Half-Life.  Unreal is killing me.  Pete, what's up?  Oh, is the editor there?  Huh?  Uh, yes.  Anthony?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm calling a reference to the U's universe on the paper. 
[01:41:00]  Are you interested in buying it?  Yes.  I saw it for sale.  I got into Penny Pitcher.  Hey, Pete, that's funny.  Hey, you're very funny, you bastard.  All right, faggot.  And Berger from New Rochelle.  Anthony, the Joe Piscopo of radio.  Al, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, bro?  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  Do we have that, bro?  You guys love, you love this. 
[01:41:30]  It doesn't happen to you often.  But we all take our turn in the barrel, but you're rarely there.  Hold on.  I don't understand because I am trying to better myself, Opie.  Yeah.  That I have to be subject to this type of abuse.  Uh, Al?  Ew.  Uh, what's up?  Yo, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, I got a song for you to work out to, bro.  Yeah.  I'm a tiger, my friend.  Very funny.  Instant, instant, instant request. 
[01:42:00]  Come on.  Eye of the tiger.  Hey, how did we know that he was requesting that song?  Eye of the tiger, Anthony.  Eye of the tiger.  What's the matter with you?  What's the matter with you?  Hey, you know what?  I got a word out of it.  Anthony, I'm going to have you cracked under.  And be like this.  Can we count on you running to work, Anthony? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, I'm going to run from Brooklyn.  Over the Brooklyn Bridge?  There it is.  I'll run over the Brooklyn Bridge.  Every day will be a frigging marathon for me.  And I need stairs.  I can run up and put my fists in the air and spin around.  And your sweatsuit?  Yeah.  High-fiving people on your way into work?  Exactly.  That would be a funny video.  Me, like, running to work in my sweats.  Listeners.  Will kids be following you as you run down the street?  Yes, a whole gaggle of children.  Right.  That I'll try to get dates from. 
[01:43:00]  Yes, it is the eye of the tiger.  Will you be going to Russia, Anthony?  Yeah, I'm going to take on the champ.  I'm the party pooper.  How are you?  How are you?  No problemo.  Now we're having fun.  You son of a bitch.  Good morning.  I knew it.  All I had to do was bring it up. 
[01:43:30]  Can't get a break from you guys.  My turn in the barrel.  You'll learn.  You'll see.  I start kicking some ass around here.  Uncle John.  Good afternoon.  I'm calling from Mr. Schwarzenegger's office.  I need to change our workout appointment from 7.30 to 8 o'clock.  No problemo.  Thank you.  Very good.  I have some questions.  Back in the car. 
[01:44:00]  I just didn't care.  Hey, Lisa.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What up?  Oh, man.  Anthony's going to look at that machine.  He's just going to go one day, I must break you.  And then that's going to be it.  You should go right over the top.  Why doesn't anyone think I can be motivated to do this?  I'm not doing this.  You've got to understand.  I'm not doing this to get like Arnold.  Arnold, you don't think I could shut up and quit your laughing, you bitch.  Listen up.  Listen to this bitch.  Bye.  You're already showing Roid Ray. 
[01:44:30]  I got Roid Ray.  Roid Ray.  Why can't anyone think that I could use this in a way to stay toned and in shape without thinking  I'm going to try to...  Is that on Hulk's body?  Someone just put my head on Hulk's greased up body.  You've got his bandana around your head.  Well, I'm Hulkamania.  I see that.  Billy.  Yo.  What's up, Billy?  Hey, Ann.  I've got a couple of chickens.  Do you want to chase them around?  Right. 
[01:45:00]  I prefer choking them.  Thank you.  Bunch of...  Yeah, you faggot.  Dave checking in, of course.  No kids chasing him.  Just Anthony running from the retarded Laverne and Charlie.  Now, that would keep me motivated.  That's all you need to get in shape.  Have her chase you every day.  Oh, man.  Come on.  I don't know what the problem is, though.  You can't accept the fact that I will be able to do this and keep on it?  Joe.  Why?  You know, why don't you...  Anthony, why don't you try a push-up before you end up spending all your money? 
[01:45:30]  You know, why don't you lift a chair in your kitchen apartment or something?  Try a push-up.  Very funny.  I mean, you hit your hand, man.  Just try your own isometrics.  Why don't you push both hands together?  Do something.  Isometrics.  What does math have to do with it, jerk?  What a tool.  Try a push-up.  You know something?  It's a little easier, first of all, ass monkey, to get into a regimen  when the motivation and the equipment are right there, available. 
[01:46:00]  It's easier to do certain routines on this machine  than it would be for me to remember to get down and do push-ups.  John, what's up?  Hey, Anthony.  Yes.  The only explanation I can possibly think of is that you saw Don West talking this  on the Home Shopping Network last night.  You've got to get this workout machine.  It's the best one ever.  You're not going to believe this.  I use it myself and look at the shape I'm in. 
[01:46:30]  And we're going to give you, you can open your own gym with this.  Start your own gym.  And we're giving away Tiger Woods rookie card.  Unbelievable.  Look at the way this thing works.  Look, look at the pulleys moving.  The weights are moving.  God damn it, I can't believe it.  Why try push-ups when you can buy this?  Why lift a chair in your house when you can do this?  This is the best gym ever, period, end of story. 
[01:47:00]  The best one ever till the next one I sell.  Period, and done.  No more better ever, ever, ever.  And you can send it back for a full refund  as long as you haven't moved it once in any way, shape, or form.  Hey, Anthony, did you buy workout gloves?  No, I didn't buy workout gloves.  This is the most funnest workout you're ever going to have.  None more more funner.  All right.  Very funny.  Scooter from Westchester.  Bud Light is not a protein drink. 
[01:47:30]  Very funny.  Everyone's a comic.  Uh-huh.  Opie, uh, Ant, don't sweat it.  Opie's just jealous because he can't fit a Universal through the door  and up the stairs of his treehouse he lives in.  Dan from Ovo.  Very good, Dan.  All right, yeah, we've got to go to spots.  Okay.  All right.  Whatever.  Good.  Am I done in the barrel?  Can I come out?  You did a great job.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'll keep you updated on my progress.  All right. 
[01:48:00]  212-757-1027.  As we go to the bottom.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yes.  And one.  And two.  And three.  And one.  I want to be a Hulkamaniac, Opie.  Have fun with my family and friends.  I want to be a Hulkamaniac.  I'm Big Big Black.  I'm Big Big Black.  If you want to be a Hulkamaniac, I can sure don't tell you how to stay on track. 
[01:48:30]  You're gonnaose me.  A Hulkamaniac and a Hulkamaniac.  Can you see every painful detail of my muscular physique? 
[01:49:00]  So what do you think of my tight pants?  Have you ever seen a grown man naked?  All right.  Those men wanted to have sex with me?  You people are tools, man.  Can I come out of the barrel?  Yeah.  Yeah, you can, Anthony.  Thank you.  Right after this call.  Craig.  Yes, Craig.  Hey, as soon as you're going to be in front of a mirror going, there is no tomorrow. 
[01:49:30]  There is no tomorrow.  All right, Apollo Creed.  You suck.  Take it easy.  All right.  Chris, you'll have better luck sleeping on it and getting muscles by osmosis.  Hey, Steve.  What's up?  Hey.  What's going on, man?  You're going to start wearing guinea cheese every day now to work to show off the new muscles?  Very good.  If you come in with one of those shirts, I think I'll... 
[01:50:00]  What do you think I am?  Vinnie the racist?  I know what I'm talking about, Anthony.  Wow.  Jason's from Staten Island.  Anthony's starring in the sequel to Pumping Iron called Pumping Aluminum.  Very good.  Funny, funny people.  Hi.  Hi.  Who's this?  Hey, it's Craig from Waltham.  Hey, Craig.  Guess what?  Oh, did I win?  You are the 107th caller.  Get out of the way!  Get out of the way!  Get out of the way!  Get out of the way!  Get out of the way! 
[01:50:30]  Oh, no way!  You didn't, right?  107th.  107th.  107th caller, congratulations.  100 grand!  Oh, my God!  You just won 100 grand, bro.  Oh, Jesus.  Do you know what I'm going to do with that?  What are you going to do with 100 grand?  Oh, man, the first thing, I have this old...  Oh, I cannot...  Jeez, I've got to calm down.  Calm down.  Calm yourself.  I am the winner!  I'm the winner!  Well, what are you going to do with 100 grand?  I get this...  Oh, man, I got this...  For a truck, I've got to get a new one!  A new truck...  Oh, that...  Wait, wait, dude.  How are you going to do that with a candy bar? 
[01:51:00]  What?  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  We just gave you a 100 grand candy bar.  What do you mean?  We gave away 100 grand.  It's a candy bar, bro.  Congratulations.  What?  You just won a candy bar.  Hey!  What the f***?  You've been...  I've been listening to the f***ing radio for like three hours, man.  You said 100 grand!  Yeah, 100 grand.  We gave you a candy bar.  That's a candy bar.  Congratulations, buddy.  All you guys are a bunch of juice.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Congratulations, man. 
[01:51:30]  Uh-oh.  This just in.  Monday afternoon at 3 on 1027 WNEW.  It's the return of Opie and Anthony and the return of WOW.  We now return you to your regularly scheduled stupidity.  This is great.  Here's a little story for you. 
[01:52:00]  But first, between 1 and 10, he's trading this.  This is what he does to me all the time.  He's like, okay, here's a little thing.  Now, on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the best and 10 being the worst, what's your favorite  number between 1 and 10?  I have no idea, Barry.  Well, I don't either.  Okay, Jay Moore's on the phone.  I gotta go.  You nailed it.  That's Barry.  I love that you guys know him. 
[01:52:30]  He was telling us that he has a very funny guy that does impressions.  And me too, right?  So, he's talking about you.  What's the deal with this?  This is my bad sign-fell.  What's the deal with that?  I come in with a bad one.  The bad sign-fell.  Do you do a real sign-fell?  Yeah, I do all kinds of...  I do like a whole cast of sign-fell in like an anti-drug episode.  If they never did stuff like that, that would have been funnier.  Like, tonight in a very special sign-fell.  Jerry's been doing drugs.  Why do my fingers look like little people? 
[01:53:00]  What are these people?  What are they doing to talk to each other?  They talk about me.  What are they saying, George, help me, George?  I have no idea, Jerry.  No idea.  Somebody help me.  Hey, Jerry, you look like you've been seeing little people on your fingers.  All this comedy all these years.  We thought you were making this stuff up.  Well, I guess you just let the cat...  You're right out of the back.  You can't tell.  Oh, I can tell.  It's written all over your face.  It's written all over my face.  Well, maybe that was the little people on your fingers.  It's going to talk to me.  Newman.  Hello, Jerry. 
[01:53:30]  Hello, Newman.  I see Bill Rawls, the fellow Jeremy Garcia, a great book, had come over to the stabs.  Have you seen them?  Have you seen them?  I licked them.  No, I've seen little people on my fingers.  You ruined my life.  You ruined everybody's life.  In fact, you're the guy who dropped that thing and ruined Jurassic Park.  And you guys got it.  Yeah.  The first radio station ever to get my dick.  Come on.  That's great.  That was Newman.  Bravo, man.  Newman screwed the whole damn thing up.  You and Buckingham.  He's driving that chief in the mind. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  There's nothing better than a good Newman.  I love it.  Goddamn very good.  Better than you thought it was going to be.  Nice.  You guys thought I was going to come in.  Oh, no, the comedian.  Let's go.  No, no, no.  We embrace most of the comedian.  I like that.  I've seen you, though.  I believe.  You've done some Comedy Central work, have you?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've seen you on that.  Yeah, yeah.  They rerun that about the time.  Very good.  Yeah.  I was like, wow, look at this guy.  He's going off.  He had a wasted youth in front of TV, too. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  I mean, McChapperson.  There he is.  Right on the air.  I mean, McChapperson.  What else do you do?  Well, my favorite thing is John Madden.  I was going to say, that's a great John Madden.  Have you guys ever seen that?  I do it on the show.  You work with the...  And also, that's a WB show that I'm on.  And then every once in a while, I step in and do some stuff with Jimmy Kimmel.  Jimmy Kimmel, who's a friend of the show.  Yep.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, we've had him on.  That guy's funny.  That guy writes some funny stuff.  Yeah.  And the basic premise of Madden is he tells you things you already know.  He's never given you any new information, just sitting there with the fox-skadoodles 
[01:55:00]  on, circles, and guys' body parts.  He tells you things like, if the quarterback, if he throws the ball and the receiver catches  it in the end zone, and that right there, that's going to be a touchdown.  Wow.  And God damn, is that Madden nailed it.  Nailed it.  And you ever hear him, like, Troy Aikman lost his contact lenses a couple years ago, and 
[01:55:30]  man's like, here's a guy who, when he puts his contacts, he can see better.  Anything else necessary to the end zone?  Here's a guy who, when he runs, he goes faster.  Come on, one more.  Here's a guy who, when he eats a lot, he takes a big dump later.  Madden's so ridiculous, he can drive a guy to drink, and that explains Pat Sumrall's  problem.  But Sumrall's got a great voice, doesn't he?  He's got a wonderful voice.  He doesn't use it.  He just does those phrases.  You know the video game, right? 
[01:56:00]  It's totally relevant or evident in a video game.  Here's a guy, or if he practiced more, he used the right word on the first try.  Sumrall's got the great voice, you know?  He's got to be running, the guy's running down the field, he can paint the picture with  the language, but he doesn't say, to the 20, to the 25, there's a flag on the plate.  Hey, if the referee, if he throws a flag and he didn't make a mistake, when they're right 
[01:56:30]  there, that's going to be a penalty.  Thanks, John.  This is my favorite thing about Madden, that he'll do like 35, 40 million different things  and throw them into a sentence, but it doesn't make sense, and nobody's paying attention  because everybody's drunk by that time.  There's a guy, and you see, and then you know, one time, and I saw these are the guys  that went sometimes, and now you know it, that's why, and now when these are one, you  know, there's a, see that, you can't tell, Michael Irvin had a crack pipe on a sideline, 
[01:57:00]  you know, this is a place for the helpful hardware man, and then you see there's a rainbow  out today, the way a rainbow works, you got the sun over here, and then there's a cloud  over here, and then the rain comes down at the end of the rainbow, there's a pot of gold,  and a leprechaun, and he's doing a little dance, make a little love, get down tonight,  and maybe I have some of that crack, and then Brett Farmer, Brett Farmer had a dog on his  leg, and once your farmer had a dog, and bingo was his name, oh, I went out of spell that  in third grade, you clap him, and I-N-G-O, the dog was licking him, he's got a rash 
[01:57:30]  there, if he wants to get rid of it, come back to him, come back to him, he'll get rid  of it.  He doesn't even last the whole bit, that's what I'm talking about.  You're killing me, man.  I haven't left this car in a long time.  Bravo.  Wow.  I think we were going to pull you off today.  Who's this Frank guy?  Ben, I just come in, and I'm the chubby kid in the chair.  Well, you've got to know a lot of comics.  Hey, I, you know.  You love everybody?  Yeah, I love every comic.  Yeah, people all over the phones are already saying, do you have a CD out, you're hilarious. 
[01:58:00]  No, nothing yet, just, I'm going to probably be out doing some clubs out here during the  strike.  Frank, let me tell you something about, let me tell you something about our show.  Those two bits you just did, Seinfeld and the Madden, they're already up on Napster.  Dead serious.  Don't bother with a CD.  Anything you say is up on Napster.  Us talking about Napster right now is on Napster.  It's like looking at two mirrors.  What it is, you've got a couple of universes all at the same time.  If you're talking about Napster and you're on Napster, what happens is that the Napster 
[01:58:30]  and this other Napster comes back, and then you forget about football, and usually you  don't forget about football, but this time it makes you forget about football, just with  Napster inside of Napster, and then boom, the universe blows up.  Man.  Do you have a Super Bowl prediction, Mr. Madden?  I'm in New York, so it's the Giants.  Of course.  Hey, here's a guy who's not stupid.  What if I said that, then all of a sudden they called it to me, kill you.  You are going to die. 
[01:59:00]  So what'd you do?  You watched a lot of TV, mimicking stuff, and big time school, you were the guy.  One thing I got really lucky on, and I don't know if this would be a goal of anybody else  on earth, but with Kimmel, the last time I got to do the Fox thing with Kimmel, they  did it on Saturday morning.  They actually aired it early, and I think it was because they were a little scared of  what we did.  They were out barbecuing, and Kimmel comes over, he's got the Dennis Miller guy, and  then he comes over to me, and he's like, what do you make of it?  I'm like, hey, a little thing I picked up in Kansas City, mustard rub short ribs. 
[01:59:30]  Open up the barbecue, and Emanuel Lewis pops up.  So for the rest of the sketch, I'm chasing Emanuel Lewis with the tongue.  Hey, get back, you little tasty treat.  Oh, man.  And then they sped it up to the Benny Hill music.  Right, yeah, running around in fast motion.  And then he tackled me, and it was great.  And my goal in life, one of my goals was actually to someday work with Emanuel Lewis,  and I've done it.  It happened.  It's over.  They've got to bring Benny Hill back onto TV. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, yeah.  They're selling this video.  I know, I know.  Late at night, so you won't see that.  I don't know, somehow I think it was better with a lot of pot back in high school  to sit and watch that than it would be now.  He'd be saying, oh, what's so funny?  He's smacking the old guy on his head.  The old guy with the smile.  Poor old guy.  Yeah, right?  That was his whole job, was to turn and smile to the camera.  To smile at the camera.  Benny taps him on the head real quick, and then some big boob comes in, and boob kick comes in.  And then we all went to our rooms.  Stan, what's going on? 
[02:00:30]  Stan.  Hey.  Speak, you ass.  Stan?  I thought we were going to bring the listeners into this discussion, but...  No.  Keep them out.  It's always an interesting...  Is this the guy who did the thing that time?  Are you him?  Dude, that was awesome.  Yeah, right?  That old guy.  That old guy.  That old guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Remember that time you did that thing where you did the...  That was awesome, man.  Okie dokie.  So, what are we doing here?  I have no idea where these coals are going.  Okie dokie. 
[02:01:00]  Man, did I just pop the microphone with my lips?  That was an incorrect decision.  I don't have any feeling in my skin.  I can't remember names.  I'm having trouble feeling my feet.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  They just happen sometimes.  Wow.  Right.  Hilarious.  It's going to be on Conan.  Yeah.  I just scored that one.  That's pretty good.  Oh, Jerry Katz.  Hey, man.  Guess what you're on.  Guess what you're on. 
[02:01:30]  Conan, how did you know, man?  Well, you've been telling me I might be on it for four months.  All right.  Well, guess what?  You're not on it this time, but Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, there's a go.  Hey, guys, they're ready, man.  They're not sure if they're going to like you, but do an impression of me and Jay.  Or do an impression of Jay doing me.  That's the funniest, man.  Have you ever seen him do that?  How about I promote myself a little bit?  Who cares, man?  Did you see Jay's in that new Pacino movie? 
[02:02:00]  It'll be great.  I got him, Matt.  I got him, Matt, man.  And you're not going to believe the story behind this.  Oh, no.  Well, I'm blindfolded at scores.  And Pacino walks up behind me, and I didn't know, because he's only one foot two.  And Jay's there, but he's in disguise.  This is perfect.  He's dressed as, well, somebody inconspicuous. 
[02:02:30]  I don't know.  I was going to throw out a name.  Here's a guy who forgot what name he was.  And I thought about a bunch of names that I might say, and then they were shows that I'd  always want to do.  And then I was like, you can't rip on those.  You're on that portion of the career where you really don't want to burn the bridges.  Oh, yeah.  You're on the way up.  We did this Leno thing last week on the show.  It was done in fun.  That's what I'm saying.  And done with love and homage.  I thought it was really funny. 
[02:03:00]  It was a great sketch where, you know how David Blaine did the ice?  We did David Blaine in a block, you know, like a bulletproof glass, having to listen  to, you know, three days straight of Jay Leno monologue jokes.  Now, what's the deal with these?  They caused so many accidents, parents are actually finding out.  Is that hilarious?  Have you heard this one?  Hillary Clinton is settling into the Senate, and to make her feel at home, the other senators  are not having sex with her. 
[02:03:30]  Because, and I love the thing Jay does when people don't get the joke, because the Tonight  Show has that audience that doesn't always get it.  Right.  Bill Clinton had sex with other partners, and that's what makes this joke funny, is that.  Kev, can you help me with a little strum of the bass on there?  God damn, we're easy.  That's funny, man.  That's hilarious.  God damn, that's right on the money.  Very good. 
[02:04:00]  I love what you guys can say on this station, and what you can't say.  Yeah.  Yeah, we can't say the F word.  All right.  That's pretty much it.  We can't say the S word.  You know these seven words that you can't say.  Oh, yeah.  That's pretty much it.  Anything else is good, though.  Do I know how to bring a radio show to a halt?  No.  All of a sudden, it's just like, okay.  Okay.  Ladies and gentlemen, time for another joke.  You got another?  I could think of one, I'd put a punchline here, and wave my head a little bit.  Is that funny?  Do you get that? 
[02:04:30]  Is that a joke that you enjoy?  Who else do you do?  That's it.  Just those guys.  That's it.  That's all.  Wouldn't that be terrible?  Like, I'm just done.  Like, can we do more John Madden?  I don't know how to do anybody else.  John Madden doing the Letterman jokes.  I'm working on that.  Here's John Madden doing Jack Nicholson.  Hey, you can't handle the truth.  Here's John Madden doing Andy Kaufman.  Thank you very much. 
[02:05:00]  Seinfeld, what's the deal with that?  I mean, come on.  Boom.  I like some of the old S&L guys, too, like Norm.  We love Norm MacDonald.  Norm's Burt Reynolds is so friggin' funny, man.  He's the funniest guy.  Can we play him the Norm MacDonald clip as he tells the story?  Yeah, you must do it, Norm, or something.  We got a Norm clip that we love playing on the show, but go ahead.  I love him because he just looks around, and he doesn't care if it's a joke or not.  He just got that theory. 
[02:05:30]  Hey there, guys.  Who needs a punchline when you have the word crack whore?  Hey, guys.  I was at this shop the other day, and there's these people there.  There's this guy outside, and there's this crack whore there.  You know what the thing is with the crack whore.  They're doing the crack, and they're whoring.  It's not like this story's going anywhere.  God damn it.  Hey, did you guys hear Madden do Seinfeld? 
[02:06:00]  That's funny.  Madden doing Seinfeld there?  That was a funny guy.  That was a...  God damn it.  That's great.  Now, because the clip we're going to play for you, it seems like the story's going nowhere,  but then he plays it all together in the end.  Yeah, that's the part I don't have the talent for, is bringing it together in the end.  No, it just goes on and on, and then he kills you.  We've got to play this for you.  I'm sure you've heard of this before.  Here's the Norm.  It was on Dennis Miller, as a matter of fact.  Oh, thank you.  Have you ever done anything in your long and storied career that you consider specifically 
[02:06:30]  to be in bad taste?  Did you look back on it?  Maybe at the time you thought it was a good play, but you look back on it and you think  that was in bad taste.  Well, sometimes, like in stand-up, I'll do jokes that I...  Like, one time I was doing this thing in San Francisco and they were all gay people  in the audience, they told me.  San Francisco?  No.  So I figured I'd do stuff about gay people so that they can relate to me.  Yeah, it's warm up.  They love that.  And so I was talking about, because I went to this gay pride parade, and I saw in it  there were these old men and old ladies with these signs that said, we are proud of our 
[02:07:00]  gay son, you know?  And so I was saying, that's an odd thing to be proud of, you know, because it's not an  achievement, you know?  It's not like something you work all your life to be gay or anything like that.  And I just wondered, I just, I had a hard time believing that these 50, 60-year-old men  are actually bragging, you know, at work, like they're, hey, Bill, you know, my kid,  oh my God, we're proud of him, Johnny.  He graduated from Harvard, you know, first in his class, you know what I mean? 
[02:07:30]  And now he's articling over at a law firm, and, oh yeah, he loves c**t.  He can't get enough c**t in his mouth, his ass, his kid's always c**t.  I got a, I got a picture of the boy here, s**t in another man's c**t.  Well, there you have it. 
[02:08:00]  What do you do?  Yeah, yeah, Johnny, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't have a joke here, but,  uh, if I pause long enough and look around, yeah, I'll figure it out.  I got a funny joke that's coming there.  Yep.  Uh, I didn't make it there.  I haven't found it yet, yeah.  I didn't get there.  He's articling a lot of law firm there.  Hey, you're Johnny.  Good, Harvard.  Yeah, Harvard.  Hold on, I got to throw a few more adjectives and adjectives into the story.  Anyway, that's why I went to, uh, the school there, was to, uh, learn to break down sentences 
[02:08:30]  for comedy.  And also the girls.  Hey, you've had Regan on?  Oh, yeah.  Uh, Regan, one of our faves.  Boy, you're going to go over here.  I've got a joke for you.  Here's a little joke.  I'm going to move over to the side.  Now, move over.  Can't see it on the radio.  Can't see me moving on the radio.  If you saw me move, it would have been a funny move, man.  That's one of the funniest humans in life, Brian.  He is great, man. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, glad.  You've got to, you've got to, you've got to, you've got to get a jelly donut.  Give me a jelly donut.  Give me, give me, give me, what are you doing?  I said, Brian Regan's timing.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do with your timing?  Do you, John Madden?  Do you, John Madden, Norm Macdonald?  What about Norm Macdonald working at McDonald's?  For your impressionist guy, I'm really getting into it now.  Mr. Impressionist guy, I know he's really nice, too, and I'm making it sound like he's mean. 
[02:09:30]  No, we love him.  What's going on over here?  What are you doing?  Doing impressions.  Doing funny voices.  That's good.  I like that.  Work on it.  Work on it sometime.  Work on it.  Do it better.  Do it better.  You do it.  More people call in.  People call in saying, do a better job.  That's all I can do.  We play one of his most famous lines all the time on the show.  The big yellow one's the son.  Rich?  Yeah, listen. 
[02:10:00]  This isn't going to sound like a compliment, but get this guy the F off the air.  I got a life I got to lead.  He's got me rolling around on the floor in my living room.  New York, that is my cool thing.  I got bills to pay.  I got dinner to cook.  I'm not getting it.  It's done.  So basically, go back to the normal, boring, Opie and Anthony radio show.  Well, you know what I'm thinking, Todd?  I'm just messing with you.  It could be worse.  It could be Dice on here.  Yeah.  All right, Rich.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You've got a problem?  A jerk off face, okay? 
[02:10:30]  You ever see Dice?  You ever, uh...  You don't know.  I never have.  I really used to love Dice in his heyday.  Yeah.  Well, who didn't?  I was selling out the garden, you know?  That guy's a...  That guy...  He's one of the quickest people I've ever seen.  Just comebacks and stuff and...  Yeah, but now he's, you know...  Hey there, guys.  Don't, uh...  Don't mess with the Dice.  If you roll him wrong, you might, uh...  Hey, Dice.  You might, uh...  Hey, there's a Dice joke.  Did you get it? 
[02:11:00]  Everyone has to knock Dice whenever we have a comic on here that's doing well.  Right.  I like Dice.  I think he's fun.  I think he does a good job.  Got it.  A lot of people want to know if you're playing around anytime soon?  I'm not here right now.  Just, uh...  Well, next time you're in town, I hope you stop off.  Look, now we want him to come back.  Yes.  See?  We want him to come back off.  It's like, I don't know.  He did very well.  Bring out some of the crazies.  I got a Robin Williams story that'll freak out.  Okay, good.  We hate Robin Williams.  Everyone has the same take now, though, on Robin Williams.  He just talks and says things that make no sense, but people feel compelled to laugh. 
[02:11:30]  If you really listen to what Robin Williams says, he's not saying anything funny.  That's what I love about it.  He does the same...  The best thing about him is he could go in a place he's been four million times and make  it look like it's the first time.  He goes into a building and he's like, oh, my God, what an incredibly wonderful place.  It's your bathroom, Mr. Williams.  Oh, sorry.  I didn't know.  I had no idea.  I was just looking around.  The lights were on.  I don't know.  What are you talking about?  Come on.  It's like Jeff Goldblum.  It's like, what?  I don't know where we're going. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, Opie and Anthony, it sounds like an Italian and someone who's back from the 50s.  Okay.  It's nothing like Jeff Goldblum.  I don't know.  I'm not sure if it's a reference or not.  Oh, my God.  They don't even make sense to him.  Now they're saying it's the same take we've always seen, but it is.  It's not the same thing at all.  Of course, I say a couple of different things.  No, no, no.  All right.  I've done that joke already.  Oh, my God.  People are like dying, laughing, rolling around, and I'm sitting there going, what is he saying?  I love it.  But he's not saying anything.  You want to work with him, don't you?  That's the key.  You want to work with him.  I really do like Robin. 
[02:12:30]  I get a lot of people who say...  I like the serious Robin Williams when he grows the beard and does the serious role.  Well, it was a wonderful day here.  All of us were having the same fun.  That guy called in and said to get me the F off the radio.  It's always wonderful when you can use a letter to make a whole word make sense.  I almost got that up.  Hey there, try the pause method, you know?  Okay.  But it's always amazing here at Opie and Anthony. 
[02:13:00]  I mean, you know, sometimes it's full of energy and sometimes it's not.  Sometimes it's 40 seconds of nothing and bleeped out because some guy said F this.  But he said the whole word and not just the letter.  That's exactly what he's talking about.  It's amazing.  It really is.  You know?  But it's great.  But like even...  I like Stanley.  Stanley used to say what he doesn't have to say in sync.  True.  Yeah.  Hey, what's going on?  You guys are looking good. 
[02:13:30]  Hey, this is going to be a great day here, you know?  Hey, I was just hanging down at the store yesterday and this guy came over to me and he's  like, hey, you want some crack?  You're a crack whore there?  And I was like, hey, you're looking for Norm MacDonald, man.  He was on Time Live.  He did the front room.  But you might as well...  Hey, you might as well call me David Spade for a while here, man.  You've offended me tremendously. 
[02:14:00]  He's going to be all right, little fella.  Why is everything?  Hey, we're banging the tables and there aren't even tables in the room.  It doesn't make sense.  Oh, wow.  I heard him tell some story.  He told some story about, I'm like Letterman or something, where he's like, this is one  of the funniest things I've ever heard.  And Adam Sandler says, so I'm playing basketball, right?  And a guy, he juked me, right?  He goes to the left and he goes right.  And I'm like, I trust you. 
[02:14:30]  How can you get any funnier than that?  Adam Sandler, at that moment in my life, was a genius.  Just saying.  Yeah, yeah, you're doing nice job.  Thanks a lot, man.  Anyone else from SNL?  Any comments on it?  Oh, I think I've done my whole SNL repertoire.  Anthony, before Brian Regan leaves the studio, there's someone on the line that wants to talk  to him.  Oh, yeah.  Jack. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, what's up?  What's up?  I was looking for Brian.  I wanted to know when he was going to be on.  Brian Regan?  Yeah.  He's been hanging with us the whole show here.  Just having fun here with Opie and Anthony.  The Opie.  Opie not as in the letters, just Opie as in the name.  You're going to be on around the area with Tim?  I've got to find out later.  Don't know right now.  Thanks, though, for calling.  That's a killer, man.  Not sure what I should say here.  Is your name Jack?  Okay, I'm confused. 
[02:15:30]  Confused.  Things going on in my head.  I can't understand reality.  It's crazier than the Madden guy who was in here before.  Doing the Madden.  Doing the voice of the Madden.  Wasn't even real mad, but sounded like a Madden.  Well, I think we lost it now.  Plug that little website deal.  Hey, no problem.  You can plug whatever the hell you want.  Hey, until you write it down, we'll plug it for the rest of the show now.  FrankCaliendo.com.  It's just, it's kind of an upstart thing, but it's about me.  It's a little dancing. 
[02:16:00]  Do a little dancing.  I don't do that.  Do the metatome.  No worries.  Well, it started out okay, and then he started plugging FrankCaliendo.com.  That's spelled F-R-N.  Here's a guy who knows how to plug things.  He spells it out, and then he says it over and over.  He spelled it backwards for the dyslexic people.  I know that's an easy joke, but boom.  There's got to be some guy who likes it.  Maybe the Regan guy.  God damn.  Hey, this is, you guys have been, you know, when you're doing radio, 
[02:16:30]  sometimes it's not as much fun as other times, and sometimes it's a lot of fun.  And I've had times where it wasn't much fun, and this is not one of those times.  This is one of the times where it was a lot of fun, and you guys were great,  and I thought about it, and I didn't think about saying it first,  but then I realized that there's a time and a place for places and times,  and this is that time and place, and it's all about good radio.  You guys definitely do good radio. 
[02:17:00]  Hey, great radio.  It's always a great radio.  It's like David, think about man in the last.  You know, that guy's got dirt all over him.  Oh, my God.  It's Frank Caliendo, everyone.  Very funny.  FrankCaliendo.com.  Thanks.  Check that out.  The show hype on the WB network.  I'm going to start watching WB now.  Thank you.  Also works with Jimmy Kimmel on Fox when the NFL is doing their thing, 
[02:17:30]  and he does a great John Madden impression and many, many impressions.  Thank you, Frank.  Thank you guys for having me, Max, man.  Great job.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  212-757-1027.  This just in.  Monday afternoon at 3 on 1027 WNEW.  It's the return of Opie and Anthony and the return of WOW.  We now return you to your regularly scheduled stupidity.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting. 
[02:18:00]  This is 102.7 WNEW.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:18:30]  Yes.  Uh, 212-757-1027, Anthony.  Well, let's just do that.  So, no, it's just this letter.  Dear Abby, my second husband, Peter, it's not his real name.  They have it in the quotation marks.  Peter is overly protective of our daughter, Joy.  Joy is 15.  Very pretty and popular with both girls and boys.  My second husband, Peter, overly protective of my daughter, Joy. 
[02:19:00]  Okay.  It's not like it's their daughter.  So, it is the stepfather.  She's 15.  Very pretty.  Popular with girls and boys.  Joy has no contact with her biological father.  She calls Peter daddy.  I bet she calls him daddy.  I smell German, Puntain.  The problem is, Peter feels that if Joy kisses or holds hands with a boy, she should tell him all about it right away.  Oh, you're very naughty. 
[02:19:30]  Is she happy with her large boobs?  Yes.  Joy understands the facts of life.  She says she's not interested in sex.  She wants to go to college and doesn't want to end up with a baby and have no life.  That's like her.  She's obligated to tell her parents that.  She wants to go to college.  She's not interested in sex, but she's going to college.  She ain't sorry.  You're going to be having sex.  Joy and I feel Peter is wrong not to trust her. 
[02:20:00]  I've mentioned this to friends.  They say that if he doesn't trust her, he'll lose her respect and she'll pull away.  They have a close relationship now and I'd hate to see it ruined.  Recently, Joy had friends over for a party and she did kiss a boy.  That's so hot.  When Peter found out, he had a fit and said she lied to him because she didn't tell him right away.  This is sick.  This is sick. 
[02:20:30]  Joy and I feel that if it's none of his business, she didn't do anything wrong.  I've told her she can talk to me anytime about anything and she says she will.  She also said she thinks it would be better for her to meet her male friends at her girlfriend's house.  So her stepfather won't question her every time a boy comes to our house.  There's another ploy.  You can't get railed in your house.  Oh, yeah.  We're going over my friend's house.  I said no to that. 
[02:21:00]  Hmm, smart mom.  What do you think, Abby?  Abby says your husband's not overprotective.  His preoccupation with his stepdaughter interest in boys is unhealthy.  Peter may be jealous and may fantasize about having sex with Joy.  Wow, Abby's right on on this one.  Or he may remember how he used girls when he was a teen.  Ask your daughter if Peter has ever approached her in a sexual way and made her promise to keep her mouth shut.  Oh, Abby's already accusing him. 
[02:21:30]  And I agree.  You're a guy.  You're in a relationship.  And it's not your daughter, but you've got this hot little teen piece of ass running around the house.  And you know she's probably, you know, running around in the panties and stuff.  Little t-shirt.  She doesn't get doodied up in a suit of armor to go to the fridge for some iced tea.  And there's Peter, you know.  Hey, Joy, how you doing?  Hey, Joy, that's nice panties you're wearing there.  You've got to leave that up to the mom.  He's a human being, so obviously he wants to have sex with this girl. 
[02:22:00]  And just the fact that he wants her to tell him all this stuff in detail.  So then where does he stick it, Joy?  How many times did he stick you?  Oh, but you know, he's a guy.  These women are ignorant.  If they're thinking that their second husbands, when they have these teen daughters running around,  aren't looking at your daughters. 
[02:22:30]  If you're a mom out there right now, you have a teen daughter, and she's looking hot.  And you have a second husband that isn't this girl's father.  He is absolutely, and this is in every case, 100%.  I'm not leaving out anybody.  He absolutely is fantasizing about having sex with your daughter.  Period.  Period.  Every guy.  I don't care how many calls we get from women saying,  no, my guy isn't like that. 
[02:23:00]  He absolutely is fantasizing about having sex with your hot teen daughter.  And so are we in this studio right now with your teen daughter.  Olsen twin.  Let's go to Bob.  Bob, what's up?  Anthony, you've got to shut the hell up, man.  You're blowing it for all of us.  What's the matter?  You've got a teen stepdaughter?  Turn 16.  She's quite the young lady.  And, you know, you've got to walk.  Does she walk around in her panties?  Oh, does she?  See?  Every guy.  And how does mommy look? 
[02:23:30]  Mommy's not so bad either.  Mommy's not so bad, but daughter's 16.  And don't even go near the three-way.  Now you've got a 16-year-old version of the chick that you're banging great.  But you know what's better?  Because that's what it boils down to, Opie.  These guys now have a 16-year-old version of the girl that he's banging.  I believe they call that mini-vag.  Mini-vag.  You know, you're missing the best part.  You ever see Poison Ivy?  Yeah.  They have sleepovers.  Yeah, and they run around in their panties and stuff. 
[02:24:00]  They don't know what they're doing.  Oh, God.  You can control yourself over your daughter and your stepdaughter,  but when you see these other little ones running around, holy crap.  Right.  That ain't right.  Bob, at least you're honest.  Because I know a bunch of guys will call up and go,  you guys are out of your gourd.  They're lying.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Talk to you.  Bye.  They're watching it, and they know.  They're parading around.  Another guy pissed off at you.  Wayne?  What?  Yo, man.  What's the matter?  You guys are going to ruin it. 
[02:24:30]  What?  You're a stepdad?  No, but I've got friends who are stepdads,  and their girlfriend's daughters are pretty hot.  Yeah.  I mean, this guy tells me she runs.  I've seen this girl, man.  I mean, she's like 15 years old, and she's a hottie.  I mean, this guy tells me she runs around in her little panties and stuff.  That lady's across his bed and stuff.  I mean, I'm out.  Daddy, I'm going to go lay out back in the yard and do some sunning.  I'm going to lay out in the sun. 
[02:25:00]  Daddy, could you rub some suntan lotion on my back?  Poison ivy.  Marsha?  Marsha?  Yeah, that guy.  That was probably the one exception to the rule.  Colmo Mike Brady.  Greg?  Yeah, Peter.  Greg, Peter.  Can I rub some suntan lotion on your genitals?  Hey, Lisa.  Hey, guys.  You suck.  Why?  No.  Let me ask you. 
[02:25:30]  I'm on a second marriage, and I have a teenage daughter now from my first.  However, when I married my second...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Let's just slow down.  How old is your teenage daughter?  Now she's 13.  Oh, all right.  Just budding.  You are disgusting.  Yes, I am.  Don't ever forget it.  Seems to be an authority on a teen girl show.  Yeah.  My husband and I were married, however, my second husband, when my daughter was seven.  Oh.  Is that because he's been around so long that he's not looking at her in that way? 
[02:26:00]  No, I'm saying he will.  You know, is she blossoming at this point?  Yeah.  Yeah?  A little.  Is she dressing up provocatively or maybe walking around the house with panties and bra on  or something?  Not while I'm home.  Not while you're home.  I mean...  I don't think it makes any difference, even if she was seven at the time you guys hooked  up.  Once she really starts looking womanly, he's going to look at her sexually.  I'm not saying anything's going to happen. 
[02:26:30]  I'm not saying 100% of the guys will act on this.  I'm saying 100% of the guys will look at that girl sexually.  And I'm basing this on fact, the fact that I would.  You know why?  Because a lot of people come out and say this, and you get these really stuffy conservative  guys, and they're ranting and raving about this kind of thing because they're so hung  up because they would do it.  I'm admitting, yeah, I would look and go, holy crap, what a hot piece of ass.  What if you were around for a while now, and you looked at her as a little girl, and you 
[02:27:00]  were there, you know, holding her hand through the chicken pox, the school plays, all this  stuff.  Yeah, chicken pox.  You are such a barber.  It's kind of like the Ashley twins.  We all saw them when they were little.  Yeah, we all saw them when they were little, and now we look and they're getting hotter.  No, actually, you weren't living in the same house.  It doesn't matter.  Let's say, maybe not at 13, but when she starts, you know, 16, 17, he'll look over.  You know why?  It ain't blood.  It ain't blood, no matter what. 
[02:27:30]  So he's going to look.  Great.  So then when he wants to have pool parties with the girls, I should say no.  No, say yes, and I'll give you my number.  Hold on.  All right, Lisa.  You suck.  Take care.  Yes.  Yeah, man.  Yes.  Man, you're really pissing off a lot of people tonight.  I speak the truth, Opie.  You're pissing off people.  Speak the truth.  Here's Dave.  Dave, what's up?  They lay out in that bathing suit.  It's all over, Johnny.  Dave.  Dave, you got to stop.  What's the matter?  You're ringing it in half, because in the future for me, my stepdaughter is seven. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  My wife just looked at me, and I thought it meant, as I was listening to you again.  Well, you got like eight, nine good years until she can really start persecuting you.  What can I say?  Dave?  Dave?  We're losing Dave.  People get pissed when they hear the truth.  That's what it is.  When we've thrown things out a thousand times on this show, and when there's not too much  truth to it, we don't get much flat.  When the truth smacks them in the face, they get upset. 
[02:28:30]  All of a sudden, your daughter starts wearing maybe a little more makeup.  Maybe she's got that body glitter on.  All of a sudden, your new husband comes home, and he's got the body glitter on him.  Doug, I was helping her.  What?  You guys are sick, Anthony.  What's the matter with you?  Why?  What's the problem?  Are you getting excited looking at sperm pretty soon?  Where does that come into it?  Anthony Polanski, your new name is.  I'm not talking about that.  No, seriously.  You can literally say about 15-year-olds. 
[02:29:00]  Doug, you missed the boat on that, though, because...  I know what you guys are talking about.  He's not gay, so he wouldn't be looking at sperm.  He would be looking at the ovum.  Ovum.  Ovum.  Ovum, right.  I'm looking at the egg cells.  I'm going to go shave, take a shower, and then listen to myself on the...  Hey, when you look at an ovum, can you tell if it's going to be hot?  Yes.  Midway through, it's a journey through the fallopian tube, Opie.  I could tell.  Yeah?  Let's go to Adam.  Adam, what's up?  Yo, I was 23.  I went out with this chick who was 14 years older than me. 
[02:29:30]  Had a 16-year-old piece of ass and daughter.  Looked just like her with bigger boobs.  Okay.  This girl used to take me out in the pool with her.  Well, I'd be swimming in the pool after work.  Her mother was a workaholic.  She'd be at work until 9 o'clock at night.  It'd just be me and her hanging out at the pool.  She'd wear a bikini.  Yeah.  Nice, man.  I bet.  I didn't know what to do, man.  She had my head spinning.  See?  You definitely had the urges, right?  Oh, my God.  That's all Anthony is trying to say.  It doesn't mean you acted on him or whatever.  He hit the nail on the head. 
[02:30:00]  I can't deny it.  I don't think anybody can.  All right.  Thank you, Adam.  All right.  I saw the hottest sonogram the other day.  I swear to God.  So hot.  Chick was shaved.  Was it the centerfold?  I think.  What makes the centerfold sonogram?  What makes the sonogram hot?  Oh, come on.  You don't know.  I don't have to tell you.  All right.  We got Sarah.  Sarah has a stepdad.  Sarah?  I'm going to kill you guys. 
[02:30:30]  What's the matter?  How am I supposed to look at my stepdad the same ever again?  Hey, it's just what's going on in his head.  I'm not saying that anyone's going to act on it.  I'm just saying the fantasy and the thoughts and him looking at your ass as you walk past  is happening.  It's going to happen.  How old are you?  21.  Oh, wow.  Geez.  You could have sex with him.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Did he look at you?  Wait.  When did he become your stepdad?  A couple years ago. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, God.  That's like, that's a guarantee.  You don't have to say.  My boyfriend was saying the exact same thing the other day.  That's great.  When you come into a relationship with a woman and you get two for the price of one.  Because that's what you get, especially with somebody who's 20 or 21 years old over  the legal age.  Hey, yeah, sure.  I'll move in.  Two chicks.  Sarah, do you like to hug you?  No, I never touch him ever.  Sarah, do you remember any times where you were a little lazy and you had your panties  on, maybe a t-shirt, no bra, and you just wanted ice cream, and you're like, ah, it's  my stepdad.  I always put a bra on just because he's not my real dad. 
[02:31:30]  You always put a what on?  A real bra.  Oh, great.  Just a bra?  No.  And that stepfather, Anthony?  Yeah.  Mike Francesa.  Mike Francesa, yes.  He loves the young chick.  You guys are sick.  That's a hot one, Mikey.  Just pick that one up.  How can you get away with it?  I don't understand.  She walks pesky in her bra and panties.  You gotta take a look, Mikey.  Do you have your hot friends over? 
[02:32:00]  No, no, no, no.  I always wear my jacket before I go out, so I can't see what I'm wearing.  Mikey, what you had in a snatch panty?  Oh, God.  All right, now I'm going to go home and look at him.  What am I supposed to think?  Hi, Dad.  You're not supposed to think anything, but now you know what he's thinking.  Oh, God.  I'm never wearing anything.  Oh, my God.  Oh, don't do that.  You're going to want to wear a winter coat around the house.  Sarah?  I think so.  Sarah, check your room for little pinholes maybe in the door. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, my God.  Check the bathroom for little, you know, pinholes.  When you're having a discussion with your stepdad, does he keep eye contact or does he start  looking down?  Have you ever seen him look at your boobs when he's talking to you?  Never.  Oh, I have.  Yes, you have, haven't you?  No, I haven't noticed.  Okay.  Oh, no.  We're looking at your boobs right now through the camera that your stepdad's installed in  your room.  Oh, I'm not in my room.  Shut up.  Yes, you are.  Now, check your room. 
[02:33:00]  Check your room.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Is your mom hot?  She's all right.  Oh, see, that makes it even easier.  What?  Like, just please tell me no, no.  Do you have friends that are stepfathers?  What does your mom's body look like?  She's okay for an older woman.  A little chubby, huh?  No, sure, yeah.  Older women get chubby.  A little bit.  Not really.  Does her body look like there's a midget living inside trying to punch its way out?  All right.  Now you need to stop.  I love that analogy. 
[02:33:30]  So cool.  That's my favorite analogy of all time.  If I was the stepdad, I would be at the surveillance store.  Her room would look like a 7-Eleven with the cameras.  I swear to God.  Monitors in the control room.  She'd be looking.  Got a camera three.  She's heading to the bathroom.  Camera three.  Oh, great.  Now I'm going to go home and, like, search through everything.  You guys, thank you for making me paranoid.  Did he accidentally walk in on you ever in the bathroom?  No.  We're not.  I accidentally fell into the lock with this lockpick. 
[02:34:00]  All right, guys.  I'm not going to do this anymore.  All right.  Stepdad cam on the web.  Doug, what's up?  Hey, listen.  I wanted to know if you guys think it works the same way with stepmoms.  I don't know.  Maybe we should get some...  No.  No.  No?  No.  Well, not 100%.  I'm sure there's a few.  But no.  Stepmoms, not.  Men, much different than women.  Look into it, Doug.  Well, my father's wife is pretty hot, and I want to bang her.  So I was wondering if...  Yeah, approach her.  I'm sure that won't F the whole relationship up. 
[02:34:30]  That's cool.  Sure.  That's great.  Well, you know.  Let's go bang.  All right.  Thanks, Doug.  Let's go to Frank.  Frank, what's up?  Yo, man.  I have a client that's totally smoking, and her daughter is just as smoking, and I train  them both sometimes at the same time.  Yeah.  You train them?  Oh, my.  What are you, a trainer?  Yeah.  Okay.  Dude, you're right.  When the apple doesn't fall that far from the tree, there's a good reason why, baby.  All right.  You know, you just want to bite it. 
[02:35:00]  Well, you're just a guy, a trainer.  Of course, you're going to be all hot for it.  I'm talking about the stepdad.  Don't care at it.  Eat it.  Stepdad.  Hey, hey.  Whatever's good for the gander.  Thank you.  Stepdad.  You're coming out of the woodwork.  Andy.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  All right.  Now, here's the guys in this situation.  Andy, you're what?  34?  You have a girlfriend, and she has a 19-year-old daughter?  She's 36, and the daughter's 19.  19.  30.  And she has her friends over on Friday, studying, you know, school work. 
[02:35:30]  Are you kidding me?  I take every look I can take.  Goddamn, your girlfriend got that womb out of the wrapper and put it right to use, huh?  You're not kidding.  And I use...  And it's absolutely right.  I mean, I'm not going to lie.  You look at her, right?  I take peeks at her, her friends.  I mean, I'm, like, thinking of her as my old lady at just 20 years younger, almost.  See?  Well, she kind of looks like her.  Exactly.  She has the same red eyes, kind of like red hair.  Red eyes? 
[02:36:00]  No, no, no.  Red hair, green eyes.  Got to get them off that heroin.  Red hair.  Great.  Red eyes, green hair.  It's amazing.  No, but you're the sad you jackass.  Hey, Andy.  I got to ask the question.  When you're having sex with your wife?  Yeah.  Do you ever think of your stepdaughter?  Yes.  Oh!  So you fantasize about the stepdaughter when you're banging your girlfriend?  Absolutely.  Hey, dude.  What, are you kidding me? 
[02:36:30]  Of course.  She's got less wrinkles, less weight.  Oh, my God.  She doesn't need a tummy tuck yet.  I mean, she's natural.  Whereas the other one is trying to, you know, high maintenance, going to the gym.  The other one's home, doing the studying, coming home from school work.  This guy, he's the perfect example.  This is going on, I'm telling you.  Oh, my God.  What's the most provocative thing you've ever seen from your 19-year-old stepdaughter or stepgirlfriend?  Well, we have a pool during the summer, barbecues. 
[02:37:00]  Bet you do, yeah.  And she has her friends over.  And the amount of friends, and her friends are some of the hottest piece of crap, you know, asses you can see.  Sure.  And, I mean, what normal sane guy would not take a look at that?  That's the point.  If you're a normal guy, that's what you're going to be looking at.  You'd be abnormal if you weren't looking at that.  And, Andy, I assume you're not acting on it.  You're not, you know, asking her about her sexploits or anything like that.  No, but, I mean, to be a lawyer is to be normal.  Okay.  To be a guy. 
[02:37:30]  Thank you, Andy.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Zach, checking in now.  I just want to, I want a divorce so I can remarry a chick with a hot daughter.  Jim, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  There's only one thing better than a mom would have stepped with a teenage daughter.  Yeah.  That's a mom that has a teenage daughter and the mother works a 3 to 11 shift.  Oh.  Because now you've got the teenager from 3.05 to 10.55 just banging your nose like she owes you something.  Take it easy, guys.  What an idiot. 
[02:38:00]  Woody Allen says, I don't see the problem here.  You're 100% right.  Rich, what's up?  Yeah, what's up?  Just, how you doing, Owen A?  Good.  I have a situation where I have a 14-year-old stepdaughter in the house.  And she's just starting to bud.  She's like from German descent.  And she's just like real voluptuous.  And she's just starting to, you know, get into boys.  And the way she acts around me, it just drives me up a wall.  So I have to, I mean, I really have to distance myself from her. 
[02:38:30]  I think a mother at this point in time, you know.  Because it's, you know, National County is very strict on things like this.  And, you know, there's only so far you can go.  What the hell is, oh, man.  Thank you, Rich.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, I wanted to move on, but the phones have just exploded.  There's a lady.  It happened to her.  It happened to her.  Yeah, we've got to take a break.  We'll continue on this track for a little while, and we'll move on to something else, okay?  All right.  Tommy on line three. 
[02:39:00]  My stepdaughter is really hot.  I think she's on to me.  I think she's on to me.  What are you doing?  Oh, my God.  It's getting ugly on the phones.  We'll be back.  212-757-1027.  This just in.  Monday afternoon at 3 on 1027 WNEW.  It's the return of Opie and Anthony and the return of WOW.  We now return you to your regularly scheduled stupidity.  All right.  We've got to get right back to the phones.  212-757-1027.  The phones have exploded. 
[02:39:30]  Anthony, what have we?  We hacked this real fast?  Well, we were going through Dear Abby's course.  And it turns out, I got a letter from this woman who has a second husband who is very interested in her daughter's sexual exploit.  This girl's 15 years old. 
[02:40:00]  And it just got us thinking and got me saying that this is commonplace.  If you're in a relationship with a guy, you're a lady out there, and you have a teenage daughter,  and you get some guy into your house, a stepfather for your little girl,  if that girl starts looking hot, he's going to be looking at her ass and her boobs  and just looking at her in a sexual matter. 
[02:40:30]  One hundred percent.  You'll be a woman.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Oh! Oh!  I don't try it!  I'm big dick black.  I don't want to come around  when I'm going to fly  No, it's going to break up your mind 
[02:41:00]  But, hey!  I don't want to know  Yeah, the phones have exploded.  Because, you know, usually you could say  the majority of  or almost all  to cover yourself.  I'm saying one hundred percent of stepfathers  that have hot stepdaughters  are at least looking at them  in a sexual way.  Tommy, what's going on?  Hey, nothing. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, man, about five years ago  when I got married  when she was only around 12 or 13 or so  You know, the little t-shirts  the panties with no bra  You know, with the little sprouties coming up  Jesus  But now, as she got older  Oh my God, full C's and all this  and the tight pants  You know, the style that they wear now  with the belly shirts and everything else  Right  So, you know, I'm looking  but I think she's on to me  She, like, backs out of the room  When she's in the room  she won't let me walk behind her  and stuff like that  And she's the only woman 
[02:42:00]  I've ever lived with in my life  that wears two bras to bed  not just one  Look at that  You know, the regular bra  and the sports bra  We're giving these stepdads  a forum today  to confess  They've been holding these feelings  inside for so long  Yep  Right, but I just want to make it clear  that, you know, Anthony, you're right  I would never act on it  You know, it's been going on in five years  But I'm looking like crazy  You know, I'm totally looking  And then she brings her friends over  Oh, yeah  It's a whole mess  And the vacation  and the bikinis  All right, baby  All right, Tom, it comes 
[02:42:30]  There's a lot  But he's all excited  A lot of people thinking  that we're saying  that they act on it  No  That's not how we're making  Some do  Some do  But I'm saying  all of them look  At least take a look  and go  Good God  Fred, what's up?  Not much  You think those guys got a problem?  I got a bigger problem  All right  My 13-year-old stepdaughter  Her mother's a 42 double D  She's a double  She's a D now  And she's 13 
[02:43:00]  Walking around in half shirts  Half shirts, right?  Uh-huh  And you're just getting  little urges, right?  It's not even that  Then she has  Like the other guy  was seeing sleepovers  I gotta go to the bar  I can't even stay  in the damn house  You gotta get out  No, if I stayed in there  It's barely legal magazine  in a bathroom  I can't even walk out  She already knows  what I'm thinking  Yeah, you don't want  to bring home  the barely legal magazine  in your stepdad  Imagine that 
[02:43:30]  The wife finds that one  What is this?  Oh, she made it  for the article  Right  Barely legal  All right, Fred  Thanks for admitting it  All right, later  They're coming out  of the woodwork  Let's go to Antonio  Antonio  Yeah, what's up?  Hey  Anthony is so right  You know, my ex-girlfriend's  stepdad  bought her implants  And he used to look at them  and tell us  she looks great  He used to ask  the weird questions  like, are we having sex?  Are we having safe sex?  If I use my fingers  do I wash my hands first?  She used to tell me 
[02:44:00]  all this stuff  that the stepdad asked  And it was his idea  to get the implants  I was like, yo  this guy's knucklehead  He's nuts  He's got a stepdaughter implant  Swear to God  Anthony, I swear to God  Man  All right, well  thank you, Antonio  And it was his idea  All right, thank you  I'm glad you guys  brought these guys  out of the closet  All right, thanks  I'm glad you got a stepdad  I'm glad you got a stepdad  It's Panic  Little girl  Eight or nine or ten  I can't resist your  to stick my tongue 
[02:44:30]  inside of them  because  I'm horny  for little girls  for little girls  I'm hairless  I'm horny  for little girls  I want to find them all 
[02:45:00]  sometimes as young as one or two  and then I kill them  when I am  fool  I'm horny  for little girls  I tip their mouth  and turn them to the wall 
[02:45:30]  I'm horny  for little girls  I fight them  and I make them  with my soul  All right, all right  enough  That could be  the worst song ever  Well, it's part of  the most offensive song contest  Wasn't that a winner?  Yeah  That was the winner  Well, we never got a winner  Well, the contest  needed to go away  really fast  I'm dubbing that  the winner right now 
[02:46:00]  Vancey, what's going on?  Hi  Hi  I wanted to ask you guys  why are you pinpointing stepdads?  Because I said  100% of stepdads  I'm sure regular dads  like you're ready to say  what about regular fathers  Right, right, right  I'm sure  there are a portion  of regular dads  that think that way  And I don't even want  to go down that road  But yeah  You know  it's happening  it's out there  It's kind of a horrible thought  isn't it?  I'm just saying  with stepdads  every one of them  Do you have a sister?  Yeah  Do you think that  maybe your dad 
[02:46:30]  thought about things like that?  No, he took off  when she was like  eight  Oh, okay  It doesn't matter  I don't think all fathers  I'm just saying  every stepdad out there  100% guaranteed  Nancy, you don't have a story  do you?  Well, no  Okay, good  Okay  Alright, thank you  Bye  Bye  Oh, what the hell  Some people think 
[02:47:00]  that kids are just kids  But kids are people too  Yeah  And just like me  and me  Vaginas  You're a selfie boy  It looks like I'm a rat  It's in the hole  Old men  wanted to have sex  with me  Without a word  They can be heard  It's like having your background  It's funny 
[02:47:30]  Nice head  You'll find  The kids are colorblind  Next night  Okay, terrific  Use it or lose it  Do I make you horny?  Can we see your stuff? 
[02:48:00]  Hey, everybody  We're all gonna get laid  And if we met  Don't just stare at it  Eat it  Oh, you're very naughty  Maybe you and me  Virgil  Virgil  Your days of finger banging  Old Mary Jane  Brunch Brunch Brunch  Through her  Purdy pink  Petties  Are over 
[02:48:30]  Is she happy  With her large boobs?  You're a kid  Bruncher  It's  Virgil  Money  You look  You'll find  Puffy  This guy  On colorblind  When they look at each other  How's that for a topper?  Like a little cute pie  Are all just  Now we're having fun  In their minds 
[02:49:00]  You're a girl  And we're to blame  If they  This is real, isn't it?  What about a new second heard, huh?  One thing I'd say  And it's pretty nice  Maybe they just might  Teach us  You're a little bitch  That's right  You're a bitch  And I'd bet you'd like to suck it 
[02:49:30]  Would you?  Yeah  That's hot  You take it  You take it now  Pussy  Pussy girl  What kind of  Faggot song was that, man?  That's a real treat  That's insane  Let's go to Amy  Amy, what's up?  Hey, I'm never leaving my room  Ever again  Because of you guys  Now, Amy 
[02:50:00]  You have a stepdad  Yeah, I do  Who are you, Ken?  You haven't left your room  In months  With your posters  Of Opie hanging on  No, that's not true  Come on now  Hey, listen to that  Oh my God  It's not Amy  So you have a stepdad, Amy?  Yeah, I do  Now, do you  Do you frolic?  No, I don't  He doesn't look  Frolicking?  But still  Like, it's really scary  Does he or does he not  Look at you?  I don't know  I don't really pay attention  To him  I would say 
[02:50:30]  I would say he doesn't  Stepdad  Hmm, Amy  Stepdad  Okay, I'm making an exception  Almost 100%  Oh, come on  I've had this stepdad  Since I was in like  Fifth grade  So, I don't know  All right  Thank you, Amy  All right  All right, Amy  She's been waiting on all  Go post how you got on the show now  And get ripped apart  By everyone on the board  Alex, what's up?  I gotta say that 
[02:51:00]  Rather than saying that  I look at my stepdaughter  She's 16  And I don't look at her  Uh-huh  I mean, she worries that  I look at her  I see she's constantly  You know, adjusting herself  And doing things to  Keep herself looking  As young as she was  When I first moved in with her  And she moved in with me, rather  But it's her girlfriends  That are the worst  I don't know what the heck  They're feeding these girls  These days, man  But they weren't as good looking  As they are now  I gotta say 
[02:51:30]  You're not being honest  With yourself  You think?  I think at some point  You are looking  You're noticing her  Her budding body  All right, Alex  That's my story  I'm sticking to it  There we go  We gotta move on from this  To get on to other things  But we have someone  Very mad at us  What's wrong?  Heather, what's wrong?  I am so mad  I've been listening to you guys  Since the day you were on the air  I've called in a couple times  About other things  Never mad  Always kind of commenting 
[02:52:00]  That first caller  Makes me sick  Which one?  Which one?  The first guy  Who said that his stepdaughter  Had to back out of a room  Because she catches him  Looking at her  I mean, this is a young kid  Who looks at him  As a parent  Parental role  We understand that  But, you know  The guys are at least  Being honest about it  We're not saying  The rights are wrong to this  We're just laying out there  And saying what's going on  That's not what I'm saying  But  Don't listen to him  We know how wrong it is  But did you listen to him?  He was proud of the fact  He thought he was trying  You know, he was being  A good guy  Laughing about it 
[02:52:30]  Heather, do you have a daughter?  Yes, I do  And do you have a stepdad?  Yes, I do  Okay  A little  Hitting a little  A little close to home  Hello?  No, no  She's younger  But it doesn't matter  Okay  Well, how old is she?  Well, she's just  She's 14  Just starting to  Blossom into a young woman  I'll be  No, but I was  If I saw my child  Backing out of a room  He'd be out of my house  So quick it's not even funny  I want my child  He's back out of the room  I'd be in the doorway  Keep backing  But can you 
[02:53:00]  Can you not understand  Where I'm coming from here?  I mean, if you make a child  Feel that uncomfortable  In a home  When you're in a parent  You know, a parenting role  That is horrible  I mean, I don't care  That they might look  Or whatever else  But you don't do it  To the extent  That that child  Feels uncomfortable  In his own home  In her own home  There you go  And this guy  Is talking about it  Like he's bragging about it  Like it's some great feat  Oh, you know  And she wants to catch me at it  Because now I see her  Hiding and backing out of rooms  That is horrendous  Does your husband  Check out your daughter? 
[02:53:30]  I don't think so  Don't think so  They fight more than anything  You know what, though?  Know that he's looking  Thank you, Heather  Bye  Bye  He's got a special  Little team for him  Oh  Another great song, Rick  I don't know  Where he finds it  Oh, Napster  I am a kid  One  It's of the end  There's no comparing  The two above  I'm the cute one, Suzanne 
[02:54:00]  I am the cute one  Everyone knows  I've got the profile  Don't just stare at it  Eat it  This is awful 
[02:54:30]  That's horrible  All right, hold on  Dan wants in on this  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, listen  I just  Actually, it's kind of a strange calling  But I kind of agree with the last one  When they called  Well, we know it's wrong  I mean, I think that's obvious to everyone  Heather was right  You're right  What, are we endorsing this today?  No, you're not  We're not spelling it out  We're spelling it out  It came from a letter from Dear Abby  Everyone was laughing at us  Because we were reading Dear Abby  Where are those callers now?  Yeah  Just gave an hour of sick radio 
[02:55:00]  It was sick radio  But, you know  And then the guys are calling up to admit it  That's all  We're not saying every guy acts on those urges  No, I understand that  But I think it's human nature  Where you're like  Oh, God, look  The stepdaughter  You know, she's kind of high  What do you think?  Like some of these women  That are married to these guys  What do you think?  You can stop him from being a male animal?  Because that's what you're talking about here  You're talking about just a male animal  That's it  You're looking at these girls  And they turn into women 
[02:55:30]  And you're going to look at them that way  Like I said  They're not acting on it  It's not like they're all acting on it  But you're going to look  Yeah, but they've got to be a father too  At that point  Well, yeah  But they're going to look, though  I know they are  That's the point we're making  They're looking  They're pigs  They're looking  They're pigs  Thank you, Dan  They're guys  Thanks, Dan  All right, guys  All right  It's a horrible, awful thing  But until we reach the point of evolution  Like Spock  And the rest of the Vulcans, Opie  Where you can put that aside 
[02:56:00]  For logic and reason  It's just the way it is  Ron, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey  How you guys doing?  Good  I have it worse than anybody  Okay  Identical  Twins  Sixteen  Look like  Jessica  Alba  Double the pleasure  Double the fun  Not fair  And what?  You're married to their mom?  Their mom  I'm 45  She's 44  They're 16  And they look like spitting images  And it's not right  It is not right  I'm getting in trouble for this one, fellas  Does the F truck pull up to your house? 
[02:56:30]  It hasn't yet  But it's getting harder to fight it away  Hey, I got a song for Ron, if you will  All right  Another good  You're the end of the rainbow  My pile of gold  I told that  Uh-huh  Your daddy's little girl  To heaven move 
[02:57:00]  A precious gem  Yes  Is what you are  Look what I did to you  Your mommy's bride  And shining star  Excuse me while I whip this out  Your spirit of Christmas  Christmas  My star on the tree

[02:58:00]  And I bet you'd like to suck it  Wouldn't you?  You ever seen a grown man naked?  All right  Kenny, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, Owen?  I need to walk through a car wash  This is a dirty, dirty show  Kenny, what's up?  What's up?  I got a perfect analogy for any doubters  That it's 100% in your mind  It's just a thought  All right  If you're driving a, like you say  A 1980 Camaro  And, you know, it's got over 100,000 miles  It's not what it used to be  And every day you have to park next to a 2001 Camaro 
[02:58:30]  And you get out  You tell me you're not going to think about driving that Camaro?  You're always looking up crazy  Oh, my God  You're going to think about it  That's all there is  Upgrade for the newest model, right?  100%  Right?  Well, they could do that with anybody  If that's what the guys want to do  They could do that with any girl  You know, meet in a bar or whatever  I'm just talking, you know, the stepdaughter  They're going to look  It's a younger version, right?  It doesn't have as many miles on it  Good to go  All right, thank you  It's been good, boys  We got it  All right  We should move on 
[02:59:00]  This is just so wrong  Rich, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey  I just want to just congratulate you guys  On the lows that you reach  Every day you make radio that much more interesting  I mean, pretty soon you guys are going to find out  Whether or not you climb out of China  Or fall out of China  Low  It's great  How low can we go?  And admitted that sonograms are hot today  So, I mean, you take it much lower than that  Hot Sonic  Oh, man  Well, you can always look to see how, you know, what's going on during, you know, the menstruation cycle 
[02:59:30]  Whether or not she's going to be hot  Ah, thank you, Rich  Now, thank you for taking it even lower  Oh, no, not this one  This is horrible  The other end may think I'm kind of sick  Because of where I like to get my sick 
[03:00:00]  And how I always thought of the pain  And how I always thought about the pain  I met that little hottie John today  Oh, definitely  I wish that thing could somehow understand  I'm just a marriage ordinary man 
[03:00:30]  Hold on to your hat  Somehow they just can't seem to get  While Maggie and Simpson always make me wet  Here it comes  Baby Rayburn  I'm a baby Rayburn 
[03:01:00]  So sweet and young  They're good enough to eat  Another eight foot song entry  Baby Rayburn  I'm a baby Rayburn  The youngest cherries  I always taste so sweet  Turn it off  My feet stop and  When mommy turns away 
[03:01:30]  I don't know  Sing this song  Tell them that they're sweet  Okay, terrific  As I flip the little booties off their feet  Baby Rayburn  I'm a baby Rayburn
