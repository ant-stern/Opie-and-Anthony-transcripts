<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with a discussion about President Obama's appearance on David Letterman,  the anger at political town hall meetings (with speculation about racism as a factor), and gun control debates, particularly in New York, referencing the roles of Mayors Dinkins, Giuliani, and Bloomberg.  Listeners called in to express concerns about potential new gun taxes and regulations, with one caller sharing a personal anecdote about a mass shooting.  The conversation also included extensive, often vulgar, commentary on the massive new video screen at the Dallas Cowboys' stadium, its size, and potential problems (like footballs hitting it).  The hosts used highly offensive and vulgar language throughout,  frequently interrupting calls with sarcastic and humorous (and often inappropriate) remarks, including jokes about race and age.  Technical difficulties with phones and microphones also plagued the broadcast.

The show then shifted to the hosts' frantic attempts to secure tickets to a U2 concert and a Yankees game. Anthony, particularly aggressive, demanded immediate U2 ticket delivery and a day off afterward.  This led to a discussion of the U2 tour's logistical scale (206 tractor-trailers), its profitability despite high ticket prices ($250 average), and its environmental impact.  Anthony's pursuit of Yankees-Red Sox tickets for Sunday involved humorous threats of a "hostage situation" if tickets weren't delivered. Opie jokingly mocked Anthony's complaints, revealing his own ticket struggles. A U2 stagehand called in, detailing the concert setup.  The hosts received ticket updates from their staff, met with varying degrees of success and comedic frustration.  A caller questioned their entitlement given their financial situation.  Past bad concert experiences (Rolling Stones, Police) were recounted.

The show’s focus turned to a list of the "50 Best Movies of the 2000s," sparking heated debate among the hosts and callers.  Films like *Crash*, *The Dark Knight*, *Kill Bill*, and others were discussed, with significant disagreement over the list's choices and methodology.  Numerous callers offered opinions, often leading to personal anecdotes and tangents.  The debate over *Crash*, with one host finding it deeply meaningful and another questioning its value, was particularly lengthy.

The next segment largely focused on movie discussions, a listener's experience with ancestry.com, and the upcoming appearance of Michael Moore.  Further movie debates included *40 Year Old Virgin*, *Old School*, *Anchorman*, *City of God*, *Before the Devil Knows You're Dead*, *Shaun of the Dead*, *Hot Fuzz*, *Kiss Kiss Bang Bang*, *Roger & Me*, and *Bowling for Columbine*.  The graphic violence in *City of God* and Brazilian drug lord methods were discussed, along with John Belushi's struggles with addiction and anecdotes about *Animal House*.  A listener detailed their ancestry.com experience, including a funny story about a large family reunion.  Michael Moore's new film was heavily discussed, focusing on its critique of capitalism.  The hosts shared their experiences seeing it, including an encounter with a drunk moviegoer.  Graphic violence, including Brazilian extrajudicial killings and "necklacing," was described. Another caller shared a ghost story, leading to a discussion of the afterlife and heaven, often with humorous and absurd hypotheticals.  Discussions about clamshell packaging and self-inflicted injuries from opening it also arose.

The final segment began with discussions of burial practices, specifically casket-related earthquake fears. This transitioned to a debate about brushing teeth in the shower, with a caller confessing to showering while engaging in other activities. A caller shared a pre-9/11 news story about a baseball player stabbing himself opening packaging, leading to a discussion on excessive packaging.  Rob from Columbus recounted his girlfriend's Sonicare toothbrush incident, resulting in a graphic discussion about unusual objects used for female masturbation. A humorous song satirizing Cleveland, Ohio, was played multiple times, with callers sharing their experiences of the city.  A caller described a disturbing video involving cake icing and a dog.  Further calls included a power washer incident, more Yankee ticket discussions, and a story about a dog spitting on a 13-year-old. The show concluded with Chris Cornell’s “Seasons”,  continued Yankee ticket frustrations, and a discussion of a song played repeatedly near the studio, leading to a discussion of 70's TV shows like *The Partridge Family* and *The Brady Bunch*.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  well as long as we get that intro i know it's time to it's time to do another radio show  cast as they say that's right i'm so sad to hear this about the president what happened  he was still letterman apparently and they said after the show obama slipped into a manhattan  church gym to play some basketball with his aides i'm so sorry to hear that i like that a lot  played with his aides that's got to be very difficult at some times because i don't think 
[00:00:30]  you have the doran's stamina i really like obama too that's a shame magic johnson did that  yeah that's funny and no one wanted to foul him sometimes you read something like i know that  that's not what they spell it different but i hope the secret service has to look into you now  for saying that no it's spelled a-i-d-e-s there you go of course speaking of of obama did you watch  him i let him in no but he seems like he's entertaining and enjoyable yeah i saw some  clips online and uh very personable you know he's a fun guy when he just sits down and and yaps with 
[00:01:00]  people he seems to have a good personality and uh it's funny off the cuff kind of things when he's  having a conversation a speech and a question by the press and he takes that off the cup i'm not i'm  not off the cup off the cup i said didn't i cup i thought you said cup too oh okay  hold on let me take a drink out of my cuff  uh it's good well let's uh i think we got two clips the black uh clip was pretty good right 
[00:01:30]  yeah yeah you know i saw this online too this morning but uh obama in front of his color yeah  exactly let's get right into it i started uh noticing when they would have these uh the town  hall meetings and uh there was vitriol and the general animosity and anger and shouting and pushing  and uh just unsavory behavior reported and i don't know if it was generally speaking but it would  be reported here and there and then within the last week uh a couple of days ago jimmy carter  uh started talking about this behavior and was speculating uh that perhaps uh this unease or or 
[00:02:00]  poor decorum was because people uh was rooted in racism uh is is he onto something there or is  that just something to talk about well that was a 40 second question yes and boy 40 second question  not only was it a 40 second question it was so fucking wrapped up in whipped cream holy shit you  don't hear letterman nervous that often though that you very very very rarely hear nervous letterman 
[00:02:30]  right slightly yeah he was nervous on that one the president the thing is uh i mean you see how it  was presented also presented like the people at the town hall meetings are all nasty and uh  unworthy yeah and it's like you know it's not really the case just well even if they are it's  because they're angry they're being taxed and everything uh let's uh let's listen to letterman 
[00:03:00]  again ask this question like um like um i just like um i was like um like um like um i was on  like um um like um i was on just on like um like um like um i would like um i would like um i would  like um like um like um like um it's so like and now obama okay he was definitely not petrified but  that's nervous energy when you're trying to just say it and ask because you want he wants to just  probably say to obama i love you i'm so impressed you want to praise the guy i can't believe you're 
[00:03:30]  sitting here i'm looking right at you dude he's had you two on the couch you think this isn't a thrill  of course it is well first of all i think it's important to uh to realize that uh i was actually  black before the election so the uh so really this is true this is true so how and how long have you  been a black man having a nice little moment there huh racial that's fun got a little more 
[00:04:00]  from the band after his line who wrote that line for him obama didn't come up with that  don't think so nah someone gave him a couple lines one of his speech writers maybe ben  nah someone gave him that line yeah yeah i don't know it's well yeah i'll tell you one thing  for a written line if it is written he delivers things very naturally i mean i do think the guy 
[00:04:30]  has a lot of uh personality i just you know a person so did joseph stalin very personable i heard  adolf hitler threw a hell of a schnitzel party but uh you know it's their policies that were a little  off that's all and so the american people uh uh i think uh gave me this extraordinary honor uh and  and that tells you uh i think a lot about where the country's at uh i actually think that that what's 
[00:05:00]  happened is that whenever a president tries to bring about significant changes particularly during  times of economic unease then there is a certain segment of the population that gets uh very riled  up and and it happened fdr was called a socialist and a communist uh you know jfk there are all kinds  of names uh hurled at him ronald reagan when he came into office he was moving in a different direction 
[00:05:30]  and people were sure that he was uh bringing the country down and and so uh this is not untypical  you know one of the things you sign up for in politics is is folks yell at you um but but but  but i think that what has been missing from the conversation is that the overwhelming majority  of people uh republican or democrat i think they just want to see some common sense they want to 
[00:06:00]  see some honesty and integrity uh in in washington start showing i think they're turned off by the  shouting and the yelling uh and uh they expect more from their public uh uh elected officials  throw pelosi out i'll be happy yeah i agree get that fucking bitch out of the fucking uh speaker of  the house position that's a good start can't stand her imagine people who just wanted to go see  letterman and then uh i don't know how they do tickets but they're probably just coming in but 
[00:06:30]  oh we're going to see dave on a monday oh look who's here they get obama yeah that's that's a  that's a big get that's a crap shoot you better win the win the the ratings there having obama on  over conan yeah yeah what did conan have on i don't know mark maron maybe regular just a regular  comment paul r nelson you hope that a night like that conan then again maybe there are people who  don't want to if i was conan on any night or if i was letterman any night the other guy had the  president on you throw in the towel and you just you realize you're not going to win that night 
[00:07:00]  or do they fight with a how about you get some some act or somebody on there that has nothing to  do with politics and for the people that don't want to don't give a shit get the lowest level  politician in america yeah just some like dog catcher from some tiny tiny little town and promote  the hell out of it councilman from some yeah just some dumb little talking about how he's trying to  get the stop signs fucking to reflect more who was on conan day do we have a list if you could  it was uh ricky gervais and uh leonard skinnard all right not bad all right you know something if

[00:11:00]  give a shit i don't about the individual it the president shouldn't get involved in something like  that unless he's supporting the guy uh if not he should keep his mouth shut for him to get involved  in state-run politics like that where it's not a senate or congressional race uh it's a gubernatorial  race um he should he should leave it the fuck alone let's tell the guy not to run first of all it  smashes him right it doesn't help uh uh him get elected that's for sure it's a but it's an important 
[00:11:30]  state for the party they worry about the party more than one individual political office yeah but  with the governor it's not they just don't think he's a strong candidate and he's also trying to  you know trying to fuck up uh giuliani's uh chances uh obviously yeah yeah julian juliani's gonna go for  this or what well there's already a republican that threw his hat in the ring oh as they say um i let

[00:15:00]  of cohesion of the people was he uh the mayor when ford said i'm not helping you guys drop dead yeah  drop dead new york i think that famous headline i think that might have been a beam okay not sure not  sure but it was when you know new york was going broke he was the mayor during all the um the uh  race race when race relations were really bad between blacks and jews and and he would show up  at the drug dealer's bedside at the hospital while the cops you know were being chastised for shooting 
[00:15:30]  a drug dealer um you couldn't you could not stop at a light without some snot nose homeless guy  rubbing your windshield with a snot rag and wanting money uh times square was just a wreck  uh no income coming in the state was the city was broke he was just a do-nothing  uh mayor and then when giuliani stepped in he pissed so many people off with his policies but you know 
[00:16:00]  something you go out there now it's all based on what giuliani did giuliani was an asshole don't get me  wrong he's a prick but uh you need you need a prick in there to get shit done i think if he's governor  i'd like to see that love to see julian i'd like to see julian the governor he's a no nonsense kind  of guy former prosecutor this guy's fucking cut out for the job yep let's go to charlie in philly charlie  what's up boys how are you sir uh good hey and um i had sent you a message on facebook but uh 
[00:16:30]  obama we gotta we gotta uh claim our registered weapons on our taxes this upcoming year and it's  50 bucks per gun and we gotta get fingerprinted he passed his bill back in february what's under  the radar what state are you in pennsylvania wow nationally yeah but i already i'm already printed  well in new york in new york state you got to be printed in order to even get a pistol license 
[00:17:00]  okay but you don't have to claim them on your taxes though we got to start claiming them on our  taxes what what is there to claim i paid my tax when i bought the fucking thing we all did and i'm on  your side and and how do they assess the value that has to be taxed that i don't know it senate bill  2099 and then i guess the main bill is hr 45 is it even passed because i never heard of this and  believe me i read every fucking thing the nra sends me as far as shitty stupid fucking bills 
[00:17:30]  about gun control wow that that would be fucked so wait you have to what are they saying that  money's for to go into like to to paying for gun damages or like stuff like that it doesn't it  doesn't even say what that money's for i'm sure it's just to bail out you know the bad economy  that we're in right now i'm sure it's to fight the fucking gun lobby in the nra if if that is ever  the case i will take twice the money i pay in gun taxes and send it to the national rifle association 
[00:18:00]  mark my fucking words i guarantee that's what i will do twice the amount that i would have to pay  in gun taxes will now go to the national rifle association to fight these fuckers absolutely  where check it out though and i believe it's senate bill 2099 or look up that hr 45 something about  gun licensing and uh oh yeah there's there's senate bill requiring all right federal tax on guns 
[00:18:30]  take a grain of truth sprinkle it with false and misleading statements add a heaping dollop of  paranoia and here's what you have well this sounds like a nice fucking liberal fucking uh site uh  gun owners beware uh senate bill blah blah blah will require us to put on our two thousand ten two  thousand this is an old fucking thing 1040 release tax form all guns that you have ever own uh that you 
[00:19:00]  have our own it may require fingerprinting and fingerprinting and tax of fifty dollars per gun  this bill was introduced february 24th the bill will become public knowledge 30 days but the full text  available okay this is an old rumor dating back to september 2000 all right sir see you're getting a  little ahead of yourself uh it is i apologize as of the writing september 2000 senate bill blah blah  does not exist but the legislation introduced by senator jack reed of rhode island has little in 
[00:19:30]  common with the description above um there will be no federal tax on yeah now they won't do that i i  thought because i believe me i read every single gun bill coming up for uh uh vote or consideration i know  every single one of them in every state i read it every day look at what i got on my 
[00:20:00]  on my iphone oh i thought you were pulling out a gun oh it was it got scary did it get scary there for  excited look i figured it out i could get guns in this uh there's a gun rights app you hit this  fucking thing see it says gun rights gun rights and then it pops up and you go news and you hit news and  it's got every bit of legislation that's coming up in every state about gun laws and what you can do  and who you need to write to why don't you just play boggle on your phone have fun yeah just play a fun

[00:21:30]  house why because i got all that planning going on for the wedding but you don't do my house is  yeah but you know what the house is full of like people and and and things going on and and and  there's 8 000 candles in my house it's gonna be taken outside for you know the tables and everything and  it's just like a little nerve-wracking is all you know how it is you just you know you want to kind  of just mellow and there's this hustle and bustle gonna be going on plenty of rooms to hide it go 
[00:22:00]  hide in a room yeah but i like hiding in or or take your guns and go shoot something i do that  i'll arrange no you seem like you're boiling just under the surface no well things like that annoy me  when i start talking about that because about politics no but especially about guns gun control  it's it really is i just shipped off another uh uh thing the nra sends me um these uh forms that  you fill out and send to various congressmen and stuff and you know you tuck in a little check for  them too so they can fight the the good fight but uh so i read these things they get me so fucking mad 
[00:22:30]  like a carolyn fucking mccarthy bitch she lost her husband fuck her husband you gotta understand that  she might take uh maybe take guns on trains a little you know something a bit seriously well  you think whether she's right or wrong i mean what was she supposed to do you think any law open up a  bake shop any law in place would have stopped that fucking lunatic savage from shooting her husband  the only law put in place that might have stopped that from happening would have been to allow an average 
[00:23:00]  citizen a law-abiding citizen that has a registered legal handgun to be on that train  and have taken out colin ferguson before he got to her husband and son it's the only thing  no law would have stopped that whatsoever why doesn't she see that because she's blinded  by personal tragedy which is fine you could take personal tragedy and use it but but stick to reality 
[00:23:30]  too please stick to the realization that the only thing that would have stopped that would have been  an armed responsible citizen on that train also ferguson had an illegal gun back then of course he did  what year was that like 94 uh i wish it was fucking 18 before 1865 let's say what the larr didn't even  run that hand i think we had a choo-choo around there didn't we probably mcclain tennessee steam 
[00:24:00]  a bunch of white people with parasols what could you tell us about the gun laws in tennessee and  we have a reciprocating um deal with tennessee i know i can go to tennessee  jesus i'm just fucking around how do you know this but tennessee people can't come to new york with  a gun but i can go to tennessee how does he know it's the new app it tells you all the  reciprocations it has a thumbs up in one state and like a thumbs down in the other states but i can't  bring it i got stuff i read every day but i don't remember it after i read it i have to remember  two things gun laws and age of consent 
[00:24:30]  that's funny don't mix those up either no oh no i thought tennessee was 14 that's the gun  reciprocation oh sugar mcclain what do you got a bloomberg already has made it illegal to use to  paint guns there's a company called duracoat they make a but they have a process a paint system that  you can paint your guns with and it's illegal all but like four basic colors bloomberg thinks that 
[00:25:00]  colored guns apparently are more dangerous than say a black gun we all know how true that is  here the problem is the colored guns dude that's for the cops that's that's to make sure the cops have  a better and easier grasp i disagree and me and you agree on everything i'm a cop here myself i've been  for 20 years law enforcement and if i was a thug here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna take my gun i'm  gonna paint the end of the barrel bright fluorescent orange exactly red and then you're done looks like 
[00:25:30]  a toy yeah you're gonna put that hesitation in the cop's mind and i'm gonna smoke your ass that's  what you're so right it's false security yeah i mean if you were a criminal then you would go all  right i'm gonna make my gun look like it's not a gun all these gun control laws are false sense  of security and bloomberg here's another thing this fucking prick is doing he is meddling in out-of-state  affairs not even out of city this motherfucker gets his shit all involved in new york state which  you know all right if it if it helps your city in some way shape or form maybe but now he's meddling 
[00:26:00]  in other states affairs when it comes to gun rights uh trying to get gun shows shut down saying that this  is where the influx of guns comes to his city and meanwhile it's not will it would it happen  occasionally sure do people barrel into fucking people driving the wrong way on roads yeah do you  ban fucking cars no yes you're gonna you're gonna have accidents you're gonna have tragedies you're 
[00:26:30]  gonna have mistaken identity you're gonna have people dying with guns it doesn't mean that uh uh all of  them are bad everyone that owns them are evil and and gun shows in other states and states that have  more lax gun laws uh ought to be up to the same fucking gun laws as new york city which is pretty  much you can't get one uh it bloomberg should pay attention to new york city and keep his fucking  meddling schnozola uh out of other states affairs and something to throw into the mix here uh the 
[00:27:00]  homicide rate for new york city yeah it's gonna be uh one of the lowest in many many many many years  if not the lowest ever more cops on the street and better better uh and the gun laws haven't  changed in the past year so why are more people not being murdered this past year this past year  i'm not sure well that's a hard one to fudge i know about other numbers here here's something i know  about other crime numbers crime stats was it in new york city was not part of the app this isn't part 
[00:27:30]  of the app but sure it was uh a lot of brass does not like when police officers uh make um like burglary  rape collars things like that a lot of these things are changed in the paperwork like a burglary could  be changed to something simpler trespassing um a robbery can be changed to simple battery things like 
[00:28:00]  that and then it makes it look like the crime stats are going down oh i see and a lot of cops uh have  gotten in trouble for um having too many uh really serious felonious crimes um uh uh collars they they  they uh are told hey and once you write that up as this or write it up as that because then it looks  like your precinct if you're the brass of a certain precinct it makes it look like there's less crime 
[00:28:30]  going on you just made me think of something is the cops still on the line hello okay because when  you talk about like racial crimes like we're always furious that they don't classify black on white  crimes as hate crimes ever or very very very rarely i wonder if that's because if x amounts show up  like the white on black yeah you uh you almost you have to because everybody screams about it of course  but if it's almost like if you classify them all accurately then it's going to look like your  precinct or your town has racial problems many racial problems right so they don't want them on 
[00:29:00]  the books you really got to look in a little deeper into uh people's um intention when they do certain  things and i i really do think i agree with you on that one that you don't see that many um black on  white racial hate crimes because i mean there's a lot of that type of crime going on as far as you  know percentages and and that type of crime goes and it would make your precinct look like wow you 
[00:29:30]  got a racial problem here fix that so stats are a waste of time stats are being fudged all the time  they're fudged to make it look a lot more safe and secure than it is i'll say new york city is a  fuck of a lot safer than it used to be hell of a lot but you know why remember you used to walk  down the streets in manhattan uh when you're a kid you walk through times square occasionally be like  wow a policeman and he'd be walking up and down the street now you see what are virtually soldiers in 
[00:30:00]  the street full automatic weapons they're everywhere that's which i have no problem with i like this they  rapid response teams there's national security you go down into the uh train stations yeah there's a  fucking command post with guys with full automatic fucking rifles down there that obviously is for  the terrorism but the average you know uh pickpocketer yeah he's gonna be like you know  what i don't really i don't think i really should do this here he's not gonna be in front of there's  a soldier a block away i'm gonna move on a strong police presence and the fact that a lot of these uh 
[00:30:30]  filthy areas had been cleaned up and businesses moved in uh has helped bring the crime rate down  of course it has uh but that has nothing to do with legislating against responsible citizens  regardless of what you're legislating you know it's all right let's go to woody in philly woody  yes sir hey uh and you remember uh a couple of years ago i guess bloomberg went after that gun 
[00:31:00]  dealer in uh atlanta yeah yep suing uh gun dealers that sold a gun to somebody and then the gun somehow  made it up here now meanwhile the the gun store was legally selling a firearm the second that firearm  crosses a state line it becomes illegal it's an illegal firearm it's not the gun store's fault  that you're taking out it's like blaming a car dealership you fucking sell a car the guy takes 
[00:31:30]  the car out uh goes to a schoolyard and mows down a football team that's playing in the fucking uh uh  on the football field and then blaming the car dealer for selling the guy the car i don't like  your example i love it i think a football team could handle a an out-of-control car yeah because  they got shoulder pads and a helmet they could figure out some kind of defense or something and  and you know they do one of those oh yeah get out of the way more like a soccer team all right  or cheerleading squad how about an old folks home there you go and they're just in wheelchairs and in 
[00:32:00]  their chair in their seats reminiscing about a great past there you go and then a fucking  buick grill just smashes into their worthless burden body speaking of i heard a commercial for  an old age home coming in today it could have sounded more depressing you heard it too the old ladies  yeah they're making it sound like it's the greatest thing ever i look at the hudson river every  morning and i got some dear friends i say good morning to the river every morning and good night 
[00:32:30]  every night i came in and had lunch with some women and i made some dear friends yeah dear friends  and it you just picture them smelling like powder and just dying off just a bunch of old broads  rotting together where's mildred today just oh mildred yeah they took her out in the old box you  didn't see that footage of the orderly sneaking into mildred's room last night mildred died with a  twisted nose pillow tag mark on her face the angel of death that 300 pound male nurse got mildred 
[00:33:00]  can you imagine living in an old age home someday have you ever been to an old age home no i  shan't it's just horrendous people just screaming all the time i can't i did once for work  the guy was yelling help help he's in a wheelchair help and the saddest part about that help he's in the  safest place in the world he's never getting what help he needs he thinks he needs help for like the 
[00:33:30]  nazis or something he's in a foxhole and he's he couldn't be out of ammo he couldn't be safer but  he's screaming help yeah he's basically in a womb at the end of his life yeah it's done  just screaming all night long while you're trying to get a good night's sleep you heard the commercial  too though yeah yeah what was it for river walk or something yeah yeah something like that oh my god  it sounds horrendous she wakes up and says good morning to the river no one wants to say good 
[00:34:00]  morning to her so she's got to talk to the river especially that filthy fucking river oh i know  sounds bad if you say hi to a lake somewhere or a pond yeah something beautiful her own kids abandoned  her years ago so now the only friend she has is the river she's looking at jersey to the river  yeah uh let me say hi to brandon in ohio hey brandon hey guys hey man um you got to find the video  on youtube basically there's this girl out in texas i think it was in the 90s that she went into 
[00:34:30]  a restaurant with her parents and she used to always carry her pistol with her in her purse  and uh she's in the restaurant and when this gunman comes in he starts shooting people and she's talking  about the whole situation her father gets shot and killed in front of her she talks about how it  doesn't matter how many bullets you have in the magazine because the way this guy was just he had  numerous magazines on them was walking around shooting people at for no reason whatsoever and  then she saw her opportunity that her and her mom she thought they could get outside and you know she 
[00:35:00]  goes to take her move she's like mom all right you run with me and right as she gets to the door she  turns around and sees her mom getting right with her husband laying there with them and the gunman  walks up behind her mom put the bullet in the back of her head no there's something missing from  the story the point where she pulls the fucking gun out of her purse and starts shooting back yes  what happened she talked about that she first reached for a pistol in her purse thinking that okay 
[00:35:30]  he's done he's not going to go anymore but then she realized that she's a fucking idiot  yeah guys already killed fucking people if he's still in the establishment with the gun in his hand  shoot him you had a fucking cause to shoot that motherfucker especially if he just killed your dad  and he's still there with the gun in his hand he still poses a life-threatening uh situation  you you fucking shoot him oh she was stupid then you gotta be ready and prepared at all fucking times 
[00:36:00]  i don't care if the guy's got fucking 18 clips hanging from his fucking body at least give it a  whirl for fuck's sake so what is she saying it doesn't matter if you have a gun or not  stop it no she is pro-gun constantly she says that that if she would have had her gun on her  that she regrets that every day that she did not have her gun on her that she could have killed this  oh she didn't have it why didn't she have it i thought she had it no she usually had it in her  purse but oh she left started leaving it in the glove box oh god it's all the time or none of the 
[00:36:30]  time either you carry it all time or get the fuck rid of it yep shit i carry mine all the time  fucking creeps all right brandon all right thanks guys thank you brandon  phones are lit do they want to talk about old age homes or or more gun stuff how about both  at the same time you should have them just wander around in the in the ranges  yeah really fucking rolling back and forth in their hover chairs 
[00:37:00]  doing those circles in the hover chair i say good morning to the river and i say good night  i've made some dear friends i don't think the deer is close yeah yeah she says worse than deer i know  and i'm sitting there like you just met this old bag two weeks ago you've been alive for 80 years  they can't be dear friends i have laughed at that commercial now for a while because they don't  find it 88 or 10 10 wins or something yeah it's 10 10 wins so like and it's the word she uses that 
[00:37:30]  made me laugh too yeah it's a horrendous word she made some what kind of friends it's not dear  yeah it's not dear or lovely or it would it would basically be a friend you make in high school that  you have for your entire life your entire life these are people you're just meeting at the old age  right she meets some new ones every day because she forgets she met him yesterday  how would you make places full of friends that are dying all the time yeah why would you make 
[00:38:00]  friends with anyone that means you have to go to more funerals and wait god damn there's just a  fucking oval track going from that place to the cemetery oh shit looks like fucking a nascar race  fucking ambulance they got a conveyor belt throw betsy on it's a conga line but she was a dear friend  is it lifelong friend not i made some lifelong no now we need to know what the word is they are 
[00:38:30]  lifelong friends all 10 minutes of it no it's it's worse than dear and worse than lifelong yeah we could  hopefully find it down the hall uh let me say hi to eric in colorado eric hey morning boys hey man  uh that last caller brandon left out some major details about that shooting yeah that was the  lubies shooting oh yeah okay back in like in the late 80s and the woman he's referring to is k bailey  hutchinson and that was prior to texas having concealed carry permit and that shooting actually led to texas 
[00:39:00]  getting concealed carry permit i remember that guy walked in to that place and just fucking shot it  up it's like a what fast food place or something yeah it was it was one of these little buffet type  restaurants that was patronized by the old folks quite a bit and he just you know she carried a  pistol i think she carried a 38 in her purse illegally and after the shooting she got elected to office  and helped bring about concealed carry permits in nexus k bailey hutchinson wasn't she uh she was the 
[00:39:30]  governor right she's running for governor oh okay wow i think she's challenging rick perry now who  she was uh she became a u.s senator or u.s congressman from texas for uh when uh bush was  governor so she um why'd the guy do it did they and they killed he was just a nut yeah he was just a  nut he walked in there with a whole bunch of guns and opened fire and you know i i think there were  like 30 people that were killed or something like that yeah it was a biggie yeah it was one of the first 
[00:40:00]  mass shootings that we ever really heard about and uh yeah she had previously carried a gun illegally  in her purse but she had for whatever reason left it at home that day and yeah she watched her the  guy gunned down her father and it's her and her mother were trying to leave the mother refused to  leave the you know her her husband and the guy walked up and shot her point blank in the head  and you know k escaped and she you know that's how she got elected was on that and i think her 
[00:40:30]  rallying cry was concealed carry permit i wonder if uh if you did statistics do more people get killed  by legal gun owners or drunk drivers like in any state you want to go to of course it's gotta be what  i'm saying is if you do know the answer to that if bloomberg is served is suing the gun  manufacturers why is he not suing the alcohol manufacturers who are really causing a lot more  havoc than legal gun owners yeah you understand why not why isn't he doing that because they're 
[00:41:00]  very powerful alcohol and cigarettes will always kill more people than uh guns will but um  they they're they're i don't know i don't know why they're just ingrained in society they're not  what's the matter oh the goddamn phones went out sick of this fucking place fucking phones  i'm so sick of this fucking place it's not like we had you know we had a few callers online to talk 
[00:41:30]  about we had some great callers never never fails we gotta take a break and fix the phones again  what's wrong with them again i wonder if someone else's phones go out all the time  it's because it's so complicated these systems i know go back to basic phone shit without computer  codes and all and time out errors and all it whatever the fuck yeah it's good they are gonna make  a fucking old school phone that goes ring a ding a dingy and we pick it up and we talk to our listeners 
[00:42:00]  ring a ding a dingy instead of this computer shit and now there's a phone that's on somewhere  there hello hello i hear that that's a phone on somewhere yeah that was the government by the way  didn't want to fuck what is talking about this man well the phone just took us out of a very good  fucking segment because we had some great phone calls great phone calls never fails  i hear uh u2's got a bunch of remastered cds now too i guess that's the thing on on the top of one 
[00:42:30]  of the cabs yesterday after the show they're they're promoting remastered u2 cds really so i guess  every band now is going to go that route to get even more money from us yeah of course you you bought  this already now buy it again uh that's the uh george lucas school of uh thought i think the 
[00:43:00]  phones are working again so are they i think oh instead of worrying about oprah's pate or pat  tie whatever the fuck you call it boots bootay how about this instead of worrying about oprah's uh  you know hors d'oeuvres how about you take care of the the show that's here every day working their  balls off not that not the the show that comes in once every three months and does something  absolutely as a goof take care of the morning mashup right yeah take care of them too take 
[00:43:30]  care of the shows that are here working their balls off the day in and day out they roll out  the red carpet for someone that shows up once what a year maybe maybe that's why how about you make  sure our phones are working every morning enough we're taking for granted you think yeah anthony the  colts beat the uh dolphins last night monday night football did you watch i did i saw the highlights  know what i was seeing in the paper today and uh i i need uh jimmy's help with this because he's a 
[00:44:00]  cowboys fan me that fucking screen they got at the new stadium is ridiculous gigantic i didn't even see  it it is silly in texas stadium did you see the picture in the paper today yeah i thought it doesn't  look real i thought it might have been a perspective thing like the picture was taken closer to the screen  and the background was further away i'm not sure it just it looks it's 60 yards long it's 60 60 it's  the largest hd screen i need that i'm looking where can i put that i'm looking at my tvs yeah and i'm

[00:49:30]  now it just now what now it's gating out what's gating out mean it means when you talk that goes  away don't use big talk talking well we'll keep talking because the second it gets quiet then the  sound comes in listen well let me think okay montclair this saturday eight o'clock the well mon theater  since you know my commercials are apparently too long on the channel and everybody's upset uh eight seven  seven nine three fives five six six eight don't cut this out of the replay it's part of the live show 
[00:50:00]  do you hear that noise what is that i don't know what was that a click click click what is that  click click click why you just gave a hundred dollars to mars to take the clicking out of the  microphone anthony there was a problem in your commercial well no they didn't know we can't phone  numbers with comedy clubs and well now it's uh you know runtime error automation error unspecified error  assistant producer 3.1 we got a yellow exclamation mark and he's rebooting i would gather  sorry listeners hit okay connection to the server cannot be established and and opie just threw the 
[00:50:30]  my mouse against the monitor which is really funny if you think about it because the mouse or the  monitor really doesn't have anything to do with the problem but that's what makes you want to punch  your your monitor i think the monitor takes a lot of abuse that the computer really is responsible for  you know what is the tower just the tower lurks underneath the desk causing all the havoc causing the  havoc and the monitor's out there going hi that's like your little visual interface and the poor 
[00:51:00]  mouse is it puts shit in so when the mouse freezes up you look at the mouse and go die and you throw  them out it really is uh oh dan really is a case of blaming the messenger when it's yes and you punch  your monitor and then realize it wasn't the poor i took out a laptop like i i was so frustrated with  my old laptop that i punched it to death and like the backlit broke and the screen juice came out  everywhere and i know i probably if i sat there and just kind of composed myself i probably could  have got to the bottom of it how good did it feel though when your face it felt great i punched the 
[00:51:30]  top of it closed like i gave it like a hook and then i punched the top of it a few times i can't  believe you guys are trying to bring logic into the situation i know i know throwing the mouse at the  screen yeah i know but it makes me feel better who gives a shit but it's all ripped this fucking thing  out of the wall but the the thing is that i mean we all do it we all take it out on the parts of  the computer that it's underneath it's that fucking beast underneath but the monitor gets the glory so  the monitor gets the fucking pain too fuck the monitor you don't look at the tower when a nice 
[00:52:00]  fucking pussy is showing on the screen you're not jerking off to your cd-rom drive yes you're jerking  off to your lovely monitor i threw out a toshiba laptop right in my pool as it was on and not  working it was a blue screen of death i punched the monitor it made that crackly look and then  just took it and tossed it in the in the pool it didn't even make it it didn't even drift to the  bottom before it went completely black my dell was fucking annoying me so much you remember back at 
[00:52:30]  k-rock i wanted to bring my dell computer in and hit it with a baseball bat oh yeah and uh chiasano  wouldn't let me because dell provided computers or whatever it's like well of course they didn't  provide mine yeah i mean they did but not for free it was shit and not good  not good as opposed to good opposed to good wow and we want our fucking tv back  where did our tv go i don't know someone took it someone took it they're gonna and they lied to us 
[00:53:00]  by saying it was broken and they took it out to fix it meanwhile i later heard that it went to  somebody else's studio somebody that i think um gives us dirty looks every day yes yes they might  you know whatever yes i think they have our tv all right  yeah this um phone situation is is awful where were we the uh the screen in dallas is what 60 yards 
[00:53:30]  60 yards wide now every stadium is going to have to get this in order to uh are they losing out on  joneses they're not really they're not really losing out on seats because there was over a  hundred thousand people at the game i'm guessing that the way we look at it it looks like you're  blocked by view does but you're not it's obviously above the middle of the screen so everybody can  probably look down and see that it's just the way it looks like it's blocking views but i'm sure it's  not blocking anybody's view is it two-sided it's gotta be can't be two-sided would be that's insanity 
[00:54:00]  now you're talking is it oh i think so that's crazy now you're talking crazy i think it's up on  the side it's uh it's big enough that punters are punting the ball into the screen though what  yeah they didn't get the oh it is double-sided look at that it hangs in the middle it does hang  in the middle wow that's a big that is a big screen and the and the punters are hitting it so  that during the first preseason game i think uh a couple times they punted the ball and it just 
[00:54:30]  whacked right into the screen it's the screen is in play like it's it's that well that's that's  pretty dumb yeah that is stupid how is that allowed so what happens if you hit the fucking  screen with the football they let play continue but the last i read the nfl was looking into  they let it so the guy punts it hits the screen and it just bounces down the guy had a great kick  you know a lot of air time and now it's fucking right at his feet again so who didn't do the math  and and figure out that well it has to be this high so no the cowboys i am sick and tired of 
[00:55:00]  taking flack for this ted's screen installation of porium is not responsible there was a smudge  on the thing i thought it said 30 feet above the field 30 feet somebody had to duck actually  and it's a little low ted yes i wheeled it out on a cart and i just left it on the 50 yard line  wait that's an actual seat at cowboy stadium all right that's a shitty seat look at that wait 
[00:55:30]  there's a picture on the screen of an actual seat of uh the stadium and and it's uh it's on an angle  so you see from what the five uh you got about to the half of the 30 yard line half of the 30 yard  on one side it goes from like the 15 yard line on the nearest side of the field to you  to maybe what the 30 the 20 no no you can see all the way into the end the end zone the uh  that's i don't know what that is there that's before the stadium it's like under construction 
[00:56:00]  it's still under construction they were just showing one of the seats wait that's that there's  100 000 people can go there yeah there was over 100 000 at the game on sunday the giants and cowboys  standing room in the uh it was in the end zone that could be the shittiest seat available in  any stadium there was anything nope no there's a couple seats at fenway where you literally sit  right behind a pole oh at boston the old boston garden was bad too there's some of the new yankee  stadium where you can't see right field the new one yeah you can't see right they didn't realize it 
[00:56:30]  they didn't realize it until they built it they what how do you not realize till you build it that  like the big center field monument look at that poor lonely seat how do you sell that seat how do you  sell that seat to somebody for real wait is that the foul pole or the fucking home run pole  that there's there's a same thing there's a worse well you did say the foul pole or the home run  pole he's right because i'm saying it depends on what side you're looking at that's funny because  where you could see it you could probably watch the game the game will be taking place to your left 
[00:57:00]  there or your right you can probably see the entire game but you can't um someone is saying that if you  hit the screen at the the new cowboy stadium it's a do-over i i would be dickhead punter and i would  just do i would just hit the screen over and over and over again oh my god that cannot be a real  seat these are real seats i'm telling you have to put your leg on each side of that fucking yeah  foul or home run pole we're not sure what it is yeah where is that danny uh you know what at this 
[00:57:30]  point in time i am not sure i will try to find out where that is off foul pole foul pole seat yeah i  don't even think those are the the fenway seats that is horrible one is like just in the middle of a  section it's not in the front row like that uh yeah we know the screen is double-sided should we try  the phones again yes oh my god oh jesus on a cross please work oh boy dave in california dave hey dave 
[00:58:00]  yeah morning boys hey yeah uh after that first preseason game the nfl told jerry jones he had  to raise that the screen it was 25 million dollars and he told uh the nfl they had to pay for it and  that's when they came up with that roll of it the funner is that it's just a dead ball and it's a do-over  is it happening a lot um it's it i think they've hit it three or four times and jerry jones was  saying there's only been one game on purpose two games got a video maybe we got a video i want to 
[00:58:30]  see a video of it hitting the big screen how could it be the screen came down oh don't fantastic  crushed the entire team no it's in the middle no it's in the middle don't joke that happened at  nassau coliseum all right yeah the whole thing no one was playing at the time though right no  unfortunately the islanders warrant on the ice oh oh heck we need a new team  punt hits let's go to bob in delaware bob hey how you doing hey bob the g uh the nfl rule is 
[00:59:00]  you can't have anything obstructing uh under you know lower than 90 feet okay so they put the screen  at 90 feet except the average punter punts about 110 feet high yeah oh that's gonna be a major problem  we're looking at video the guy when the cults first built their stadium the owner had their punter  come in and they put a bar at 90 feet high right in the center of the stadium because he was going  to put a screen in there and the punter hit it six out of seven times yeah of course so they decided 
[00:59:30]  they had to use the wall to put the screen up but jerry jones spending all the money you know it would  cost about two to four million dollars to move it how much would do how much the stadium cost  stadium was 1.2 billion it was a billion dollars okay yeah it was 1.2 billion the screen itself is  40 million dollars yeah the video we're watching the the punter i mean is killing the screen it's not  it's he's it's not that he's just barely getting it up there 100 feet yeah it's slamming into the  thing so what they're gonna have to do is jerry jones probably realizes he's gonna have to raise it 
[01:00:00]  so uh the the nfl will just have to pay for it or split the cost cut a big divot into the bottom of  it so it could pass through the screen put a hole in it you can't have that in your new stadium  how about if you're the punter and you you break it you hit it so hard you break it you pay for it  sir learn that as a child yeah i'd imagine that with a hymen i i'd imagine this football isn't  breaking that screen look at that thing god all right thank you sir you're very welcome 
[01:00:30]  uh let's go to tony in dallas tony hey hey what up guys hey buddy that tv 600 tons  600 tons 1 million 200 000 pounds it weighs wow and that uh and as far as the um the the kicking  does it's supposed to be 85 feet and they put it at 90 that's why jerry's gotta got it on his side  saying that you know he's not gonna pay for it because he went five feet above what that is the new sony 
[01:01:00]  e-rock why because it weighs a lot let's go to bill in maryland bill and necessary hello bill  you can fit on one side of them screens you can fit 2052 inch screens on that one side but why would  you want to do that exactly everybody watching different shows silly there's not 2000 channels  and then everyone would have to bring a 52 inch screen and someone's got like a 50 inch and gets 
[01:01:30]  yelled at just sounds complicated sir your whole idea is silly i said they just put one 52 inch screen  let everybody enjoy it yeah hand out binoculars bring your opera glasses let's say hi to mike  in new york mike  uh they were saying that you two like the fourth or fifth week when dallas has their bye has a  concert there and their stage set up i guess is the largest in the world that they're putting the  bill to raise the screen and that when they raise it they're just permanently leaving it like that 
[01:02:00]  why would why would you tall is you two's fucking set you two's a they're a short band why do they  need the screen i know but it's not that tall what do they why do they want to raise the screen  do they have pyrotechnics or something they got they have the largest stage set up in the world  literally trailer at the trailer uh that's what they're doing on mike and mike that jerry jones  is just leaving it nfl's fine with it that when they come in to do their show they're raising it  they're just permanently leaving when are they going in uh it's like the fourth or fifth week whenever 
[01:02:30]  dallas has their bye all right because i'm supposed to go in there and do a show at the new texas stadium  but i have nine tickets sold and they're thinking of canceling it that could be a problem  yes i'm like it's only a hundred thousand more steve from bayshire has got a great idea build a screen  30 yards wide but only two feet high  that's great that steve from bayshire has a great idea perhaps he could submit a great joke  oh you're busted what's that for you bastard 
[01:03:00]  let's go to vegas all right when nope it's actually vegas and maryland  oh shit vegas how do they how do they do that how you doing what's up vegas you know what we got  for next at fedex field where the rest is play they have concrete columns that obstruct view so you  can't when the ball is kicked in the air you can't even see a kickoff you have to look around it or  or try to view it on the tv above you but other than that your view is obstructed on any ball that's 
[01:03:30]  probably over 30 feet in the air that's you two stage wow we're just sorry sorry we're looking at  you two stage set and it is it's wrong with these guys it looks like the giant um mechanical spider  from wild wild west yeah oh it's got a giant it's got a giant uh circle screen hanging down from it  what is wrong they probably show political stuff there oh i bet that's why they only do a hundred  thousand people stadium the show starving africans and things like that things that evoke your emotion 
[01:04:00]  and uh it's gonna be weird for a band you start as just a bunch of guys in a club somewhere and  and you end up turns into this years later you two is paying two million for one gig  why not just do it with a smaller stage for one show never  i would absolutely be crying all right this guy drives a uh holy shit look at this stage  unbelievable this what the fuck it's like they build a little city well they don't need that  thing on top yes they do they're you too it looks like a love of god it looks like a lobster like

[01:29:30]  oh okay joe go get him go ahead i i'm sorry it just drives me insane uh why people love that movie i want  to know if you're going to do stereotypes to show why stereotypes are wrong to me it's like using a  word in its own definition the guy the head the guy wrote facts of life and to me it shows through  in every freaking frame uh they want to explain to me what's so great about that movie i love the 
[01:30:00]  acting when the cop diddles the uh woman against the wall that's a nice uh scene i thought terrence  hold on dude i'll tell you i thought terrence howard gave a great depiction of the way blacks  are treated in hollywood uh you know trying to fucking play the nice guy i thought that was great  um i loved fucking uh what getting every job because dude i fucking i'm in the entertainment  business for 20 years and i and i know enough all right well i'm around this show and i know enough  fucking black people how do i know dude because i'm in the fucking show business you idiot what's 
[01:30:30]  that you know how black people are treated in hollywood but you do stand up on the road i know but i deal  with enough fucking black entertainers where i know what their gripes are and i and i see the way  black people are portrayed in television and the big problem that blacks have is that most of the  writers are white who try to write black dialogue which is why black sitcoms come off looking like  a bunch of dumb white families they're not realistic that's why the fucking uh that's one big complaint  black entertainers have is that black shows are not written by black people at all and then it's  interesting a black friend of mine said the reason i couldn't understand the best picture when he said 
[01:31:00]  you want to know why white people love this because liberal it makes liberals think they get it i love  tyler perry movies i gotta tell you oh do they make me laugh when he puts that woman suit on  oh it's tyler perry genius but to me it was great because it actually it gives redemption to  fucking every character it gives redemption to the lapd which it's really typical to show the  lapd being all the racist pig cops but then they show you this is what the cops will do to save your 
[01:31:30]  life like it shows a good both sides of every person and like you figure that the big you understand  like this this matt dylan is trying to help his father and it's like we've all dealt with that that  fucking fat civil service employee uh that fat black lady and they don't make matt dylan the  villain in that one and then at the end of the movie they show that lady being a racist cunt screaming  at the chinese lady so they show everybody acting like a piece of shit and they give kind of redemption  to every character as well yeah i thought it was of the year yeah well you're you're saying why is 
[01:32:00]  everybody like this movie dude and i'm telling you why i like it and why it's not politically correct  jimmy made his point uh what i want to all right joe joe hold on a minute you have a problem with  it being best picture what was it up against does anyone remember it was a shock that it won  what was it up against because now when you look back it's obvious it's so obvious at times like oh  man that movie good is the movie that lost what's a good example that was a raging bull raging bull  lost raging bull should have won best picture oh oh oh joe it's um it won that year but i remember 
[01:32:30]  being thrilled that it won because it was some heavily favored movie that was winning everything  except for that that's what i was it was it was it the fucking brokeback mountain or something danny's  looking it up let's see if we can find uh the nominees for that year that would be uh that would  be interesting oh i say interesting much and the nominees are and you know what joe another thing i  liked about it where it's not politically correct in the opening scene ludicrous and his friend are  walking and then of course brendan frazier and sandra bullock are scared of the black people so 
[01:33:00]  hollywood's typical message is you're a racist but what happens the guys pull out fucking guns  and rob them they show you that all stereotypes aren't wrong either you can sometimes judge people  on site wow crash beat brokeback mountain okay that's capote good night and good luck and munich  i i love that's not an that's not like an upset no yeah it was no crash is right right in there  with those movies that was a huge upset over brokeback huge over capote too yeah kind of was 
[01:33:30]  broke back uh yeah you know yeah that was hoof and it's also i get so sick of films trying to preach  these they're usually liberal agenda social messages and this one the way they the way they give  fucking the way they they humanize matt dylan in that scene where he now of course they were kind  of i think doing the black community and the cops by that woman and and him kind of each was  representing yeah but the way they showed this guy going into a burning car it's like it's really  easy to villainize a cop in a movie but then when you see what this guy will do to protect you uh you 
[01:34:00]  know he really will put his life on the line i i just love it you don't even think about a call  of someone you just do it but do you want to tell you that but do you see what i'm saying though like  that's why i liked it because they didn't give me a typical message a typical predictable message i  didn't feel as strongly about that movie a lot of people might not why but i i just i i love don  cheetle he might be my favorite actor i love fucking cheetle yeah so anything he's in i tend to  like he's even good in bad movies really good but he's good in a movie now all right joe thank you 
[01:34:30]  i appreciate the phone call all right all right joe we found uh the only guy that didn't like  heath ledger in the dark knight it's jason from the new jersey turnpike what's up jason yeah i just  think that you know granted he died but you can't just give a guy the best picture just because  or the best actor because he just put on a bunch of makeup you want a real performance you got to look  at jack nicholson i mean that was a real performance over the top drivel you're kidding  the top wait jack nicholson as the joker this guy's joking yeah i mean he was a cartoon he's a dated 
[01:35:00]  movie but you know what that was a real performance keith ledger everyone's just expecting oh my god  dude he's ledger brought in a whole serial killer angle and all sorts of sick yeah here's why i don't  agree with the caller at all dude i'm telling you it's almost like nicholson was good at the time  of course he was but when you look at like what was a more believable character opie's right nicholson  cartooned it up which again that was what the role called for the whole movie was cartoony they  just took the whole thing into a new direction ledger made this guy into a sociopath and to me made 
[01:35:30]  him a very fucking interesting guy to watch like nicholson was just a guy played like he took a  character i think that we had all seen a million times and portrayed him completely like a true  maniac i love what ledger did with the joker i think palance is such a ham the whole movie what's  that ledger keith ledger barely spoke the whole movie it was mumbled that's absolutely not the  truth he spoke a lot in the movie what are you talking about when he wasn't speaking was just  amazing him like him with his head outside the out the window his head oh my god what a scene his 
[01:36:00]  head outside the window when he's going come on hit me he's trying to get the fucking he's trying  to he's trying to commit suicide by getting this fucking motorcycle to run him over the scene when  he's asking fucking gary oldman how does it feel to be as alone as you are that was someone wrote  that for him someone wrote that for him i didn't say he deserved to be a writing nominee you fucking  moron i said it's an acting performance de niro didn't write raging bull but he fucking won best  actor for it thank god someone wrote it for him he's a hey i'm a bull and i'm raging 
[01:36:30]  what do you think fucking nicholson wrote his own joker dialogue are you just guy trying to be  different he put his own that when he gets pissed he really gets pissed oh i see shut up well so  someone said thank you sir someone someone's saying that robert downey jr should have won over  heath ledger for uh tropic thunder yeah i really should have who's who said that fucking miss downey  senior red boo boo 
[01:37:00]  what is that about nothing uh are you upset today no i'm fine all right i'm fine too then you're all  right right yeah all right good uh 50 best movies of the 2000s uh shrek cast away i'm just gonna go  down this list until something pops where we need to talk cast away was in the 2000s is that the 
[01:37:30]  one you had a problem with too jimmy no i mean it's like tom hanks is good in that but it's like you  know come on always have a problem with cast away because of the trailer they fucking showed him back  home and and it just like it fucked up the whole you watch the movie and you realize he doesn't die on  that island uh and and that whole scene where he's getting the vines together to hang himself it's not  dramatic because you're like i saw the trailer and by the way he gets home so and then the drama  continues with him and his chick the trailers really have got to stop they've gone way too far 
[01:38:00]  now way too i like a trailer that just makes you go like what the fuck is this i like the trailers  for movies that they barely filmed they just give you like 10 seconds because that's all of it that's  all they've filmed so far yes but they make you go what like you said what the fuck that looks cool  all right right kind of getting the gist of this is a crime thing or a sci-fi or something that's  good well let's move on with the list so you got the uh castaway okay the incredibles 45 a beautiful

[01:47:30]  today well that was an oldie from him a lot of robert blake was great in that though in  fucking moholland drive so you saw it jimmy you like it it's a typical weird lynch movie but i like  him because he's the guy has his own style he's a complete original he's a weird dude but you know what  you're in for this movie strange dude but he's done some interesting stuff i like him yeah  all right uh 19th place 300 uh we did lord of the rings return of the king that was 18 district  nine this is why this list is ridiculous the movie just came out it's one of the top 50 movies anybody 
[01:48:00]  else besides me see district nine in here i did not see district like it wasn't a bad flick it was  pretty cool but at the same time like i've seen enemy mine and some other alien flicks  and you know everybody's talking about district nine how it's like the best film they've ever seen  it's always the best sci-fi and then you ask these people it's like well have you ever seen it and  like no i'm i'm 19 it's just like well why don't you go check out enemy mine yeah and then maybe you'll 
[01:48:30]  you'll you won't think that enemy mine just stunk yeah but but it's the same but it's the same  concept district nine is almost like that it was really fucking bad i'm back this is gonna be  embarrassing anthony actually did talk to stanley and now nicole anthony or kenny i mean kenny sorry  and now nicole is front center walking back this way and past our studio okay here she comes look at  those two holy mackerel we're waving she gives it she's giving a spin and a very nice

[01:49:30]  nurtured and low right on your cheek the warmth and softness of them and then talk like dac wow  not like dac isn't it drac i thought it was drac oh is it i always called him dac  maybe i'm wrong yeah you're probably right it's probably just drag the point is that district nine  it's not this huge great movie that everybody's i mean it's not bad it's really good it was a really  good flick but to be like part of like the the top 20 of the 2000s you really can't put a movie from 
[01:50:00]  from 2009 on this list you got to give it a little time to see how it does right exactly i mean you can  still see it in the theater well here we go there's another one on the two uh from from this year but first  uh oh boy stranger than fiction number 16 was that the will farrell movie where he was typing and  everything came to life well the good woman was making a book and was that that movie yeah yeah that's  what it was holy shit was that horrible terrible horrible i tried it twice 
[01:50:30]  thank you to not use language like that i happen to have my young son in the car  finally a movie that we could all agree with american psycho number 15 never saw it that's a good one  you haven't seen american cycle i like that movie oh my god i'm not a christian bale fan and i read  the book oh my god and the book was so vile i've heard enough about the movie where it's good but  to me it's like a disney film compared to what the book was yeah uh american psycho okay 14 planet terror 
[01:51:00]  uh planet terror yeah oh with robert rodriguez yeah oh right okay it was good uh the departed 13  why that was very overrated i kind of liked uh the departed one of the best movies in the 2000s  i don't know but i like i like that little surprise at the end what the what was that oh when that  elevator opens oh jesus oh they shoot him whoa yeah that was a good one actually i do remember that

[02:03:00]  fucking super bad that goddamn movie is his fucking terrible i can argue with that love it  i was telling anthony before the show yesterday i saw um animal house over the weekend haven't seen  in years and that was a huge movie for john belushi obviously yeah he he doesn't belong in the movie  it's the weirdest fucking thing go re-watch animal house yeah i have recently he's so disconnected from  everybody else in the movie he's barely in it like everyone else is you know there's character 
[02:03:30]  development and their storyline storyline they're acting their balls off and then he comes in the  middle of these scenes to do some frat prank and then walks away again yeah it is so weird yeah and  that kind of made him it made as a movie guy and getting him off of snl and yeah like he did food  fight he drank what a whole bottle of jack daniels he crushed the beer can on his head it was always  like frat the guitar that was a guitar yeah food fight scene was three seconds long i think literally 
[02:04:00]  three seconds long of him goes when he goes food fight and then he runs away basically and then  and there's nothing i'm not saying is it he goes is it yeah get it but i'm not saying he was bad in  the movie or or he was just so disconnected yeah he had nothing to do with anybody else in that movie  what um it was almost like he came in like for a couple days here and there to do these quick  scenes and then he was out while everyone else was you know really honing their craft they took  the bar the whole fucking bar right it's one of his lines what was something about mary niedermeyer 
[02:04:30]  was way better in that movie than my father was the officer right how does it feel to be an  asshole niedermeyer  oh you know what and why isn't super bad on this list or ah see how about that that's better  than anchorman should have been on the of course it is going back to anchorman but there were better  comedies in the 2000s than anchorman uh no country for old men all right battle royale number two city 
[02:05:00]  of god that was a brazilian movie shut up that was very good little dice was the star was the name  of the star of that movie in the movie it was about the projects and uh i want to say it was either rio  or sao paulo uh city of god i am right i think he's right it was it was fucking it was about a  violent gang member in uh in in brazil it was fucking i want to say rio but it was about the  slums of brazil it was fucking great i think he's right i think he's acting city of god was good 
[02:05:30]  oh now i don't know look at his smile now i don't know now it was good little dice  who's little dice that was the name of the hey look at me i'm tiny no you gotta do that  i'm tiny hey i'm just an ordinary dice you'll lose your voice we need something on the board  where we could like fucking make your voice nice and high i forget the name began with a z 
[02:06:00]  is it it was some weird name he had the nickname his nickname in in portuguese was meant little  dice it was about why little dice what was that was i don't i don't remember little dice i know  there's a scene where the kid walks into a brothel and fucking kills everybody in the brothel i think  it was a true story actually you're you're you're i can't actually no jimmy's telling the truth for  is he yeah city of god was very good let me see look this way no then he fucking put on the weird  face to throw everyone off then he puts on his little impish i'm going with he's telling the 
[02:06:30]  truth what was the guys oh it does say little dice zed or sure right what's the kid's name okay  zed is dead uh city of god is amazing a bunch of people saying how great the movie is it was  brilliant jordan said yeah a great story and a bit of the old ultra violence ultra violence and then  morning kill at radio gold fans writes belushi crashes scenes like he's the fucking kool-aid man  and then someone else said my god turn your ringer off that belushi uh 
[02:07:00]  would could only work a couple days a week because he was doing snl at the time  oh really but now when you look at that movie you go back you he really doesn't  yeah it's just he's got these bits and pieces so separate from the rest of the cast pops in the movie  like he wasn't on the road trip where the negroes stole their dates  he was there when they pulled the car in right and then did that little thing where you know he  took the bottle and broke it over his head and stuff so like things were happening and then he 
[02:07:30]  would just pop in and fuck with the scene and then you didn't see him anymore and remember toga  party he was there for that i remember uh they're finally bringing it bringing it back after many  years uh but they're finally bringing the breast back into comedies yes fucking animal house had some  some titties titties man some titties where he's on the ladder oh yeah looking at the girl uh  god and then some stuff you just can't put in movies anymore i was telling aunt the uh the line 
[02:08:00]  about primitive culture oh yeah when that whole scene is going down in the black bar you're studying  primitive cultures i'll sit oh my mouth and uh otis day on the night and then the chick when she admits  that she's only 13 yeah they wouldn't put that in the movie anymore otis my man and by the way they  fucked up because at the end of the movie she goes to her father and says and goes uh we have to get  married but if you remember the movie at all they didn't have sex in the movie so why would they have 
[02:08:30]  to get married that technicality i think they did have sex when in the stadium in the sleeping bag  yeah but there was enough time to figure out if she was pregnant or not that was only like a day or  two before i think it was just because she kind of you know they had sex oh really yeah i don't  think she was pregnant yeah uh dean warmer's wife and number one was to kill bill via one and two  dean she was great well i have a husband dean warmer 
[02:09:00]  still want to show me your cucumber cut the crap and get me a drink  let's go to bobby brooklyn bobby hey you know the best movie i think of uh 2000s was uh  40 year old virgin that was uh far better than old school that movie was a a lap a minute hands  down about the county 40 year old virgin at least was better than anchor man i keep going back to  that movie because they're that's the top comedy on the list and what about once was this by roland 
[02:09:30]  we can order oh once remember that movie that roland brought to our attention good iron gang  allen's ass is horrible horrendous and did you go back to the one picture in the because i noticed  this in the movie this one girl she agreed to show her breasts but not her nipples because the window  pane kind of kind of i could see him in the first shot there though oh yeah they're pretty perky  yeah you're right they look are they implants they look like uh let me say hi to nick in norwalk 
[02:10:00]  how's it going hey anthony you should get city of god and watch it in your little movie theater  there oh yeah there's a there's uh there's a lot of guns and uh there's a lot of uh there's a couple  scenes with some cute girls in it man so i'm like you know 19 19 year old girls on the beach  brazil's a rough place man my jonathan of course was showing me some uh thing about travel like  this dvd you had on different things and there's some in brazil they have these weird like fight 
[02:10:30]  parties where like in the slums they do this where the drug lords throw them and i think people just  go there and they dance all night and there's a lot of fights and no there's no pictures or anything  taken and they caught some member of the press infiltrating one of these parties and getting video  and audio they fucking put this motherfucker in a thing of tires and burned them alive wow  well they killed him oh they we was one of the biggest journalists in brazil and they them drug  dealers they don't say much though killed him a lot of people brazil's a big country i mean sao 
[02:11:00]  paulo is fucking just dwarfs in new york there's like 24 million people in sao paulo they say that's  where hitler 24 million i believe so yeah who is that then if you could maybe maybe the the guy  the the press guy who was burned in a fucking bunch of tires i don't know they don't play games  man that's pretty bad yeah uh put a little gasoline in the tires what a shitty way that's got to be  just horrendous like that water you could never get out of a tire you ever notice that yeah they were 
[02:11:30]  like i used it like like i used to have to get tires from the junkyard you go down there i had like  a nova with bad alignment so every six months or so i'd have to get new front tires for my car  they couldn't buy me because front end was fucked up whatever so you'd go down to the junkyard for  like 10 bucks you'd pick up a few that had a little tread left on there and slap them on and there'd be  water in there and no matter how you shake the tire spin it roll it flip it over yeah they'll always 
[02:12:00]  be fucking water you had to get like paper towels and you know soak it up yeah you try holding it and  then jumping lift it up and then and then pull it back so it comes out a little donut you try to be  quicker than the water yeah i know i can be quicker than this flip it out it goes back in  just fill that with gas though like that and then stack it up put the guy in there and light it  they used to call um uh in south africa they had some name for it the winnie mandela or something  yeah winnie mandela used to love doing that it was some kind of necktie or something they put 
[02:12:30]  around your neck wouldn't you just and it's like why would you sit there you're already beaten to  fucking shit so you can't even move you just kind of kind of slouched there and they put the tire  with gas in the bottom of it around your neck light it up and you have flaming rubber just  burning you think that sticks to your body oh that's gotta hurt as opposed to good  let's go to lee in maryland lee good evening hello now the reason why belushi wasn't in the movie that 
[02:13:00]  often is because he was already having problems with alcoholism and drug abuse  his wife was actually brought in as an extra in the movie to keep him under control there's a lot  of scenes where you can see the back of her head and she talks about it later uh when they did like  an anniversary for the movie or whatever like 15 20 years later i'm starting to forget my belushi  knowledge but didn't animal house put him on the map as far as uh movies go yeah and mainstream success 
[02:13:30]  past uh the snl thing no wasn't that the blues brothers though was no blues brothers was after  animal house was it yeah i don't know yes abso-fucking-lutely i bet you any amount of money  well i'll take your word on that one have you seen the blues brothers later does that movie  uh i don't like it i don't like that kind of musical thing everything you know everybody's  fucking singing blues and shit but it is kind of funny kind of like the blues in that movie 
[02:14:00]  it is kind of funny though let's go to greg in new hampshire greg  oh hey hey buddy i thought it was the best uh sydney lamet's movie with uh philip seymour  hoffman ethan hawk marissa tomei before the devil knows you're dead if you haven't seen before the  devil knows you're dead that's a movie you really should watch have you seen it no that is an amazing  director that is truly a truly awesome movie no joke rented tonight before the devil knows you're  dead is amazing yeah it's an amazing movie jimmy you see that uh yes it was okay yeah with with 
[02:14:30]  hoppin animal house is not 1980 it was 79 oh okay jesus was it 78 yeah i remember going i got you  know why i remember animal house so much and then blues brothers is 80 go ahead i got in trouble  for um blues brothers was 82 i think uh someone's saying 80 yeah i got in trouble for um  for taking my truck because i didn't have insurance on it and all all my friends wanted to go because 
[02:15:00]  animal house was like just right and and i took i took my my pickup truck uninsured and drove it to  the movie theater the walt whitman mall i think you're a lot older than me why i wasn't driving  and it's holy no i had my license your license early i had my california license which i you  were able to get at 14 i know i joke about my age and shit but i swear to you i wasn't anywhere as  close to driving i had my california license which was what 15 16 at that age you were able to get  your license at 14 years old get the fuck out of here so i i don't i don't license at 14 that's 
[02:15:30]  fucking insane it was fantastic can you imagine getting in a fender bender with a 14 year old  how much that would piss you off i don't know if i was so legal driving around with it but  fuck it i i was i was licensed so you grabbed the truck so i had to have the truck took it out and  brought all my friends to go see animal house and then when i came back uh my mother knew i had taken  the truck now she's not one to mark tires or anything like that so i think my aunt fran ratted me 
[02:16:00]  out i think she saw me i know and i haven't asked her in many years so maybe at dawn's wedding i am  going to ask her if she ratted me out about me going to see animal house because boy was mom mad  she couldn't do anything about it but she was mad yeah let me know i need to know the answer to that  yeah fran's not a rat how great would it be though if you just hold off and belted your aunt fran in  the jaw for telling on you oh i was just sicilian revenge it's name man that family don't play oh holy 
[02:16:30]  shit ants relatives don't play oh my god all right i guess that's enough about movies right  i don't know yeah see city of god it's really good man i think you'd like it a lot i think i'm  gonna see a couple movies on that list city of god is definitely one of them there's a lot of  movies i'm not gonna see on that one hot fuzz wasn't better than shawn of the dead sorry mongo  lil say what was fuzz was good but shawn of the dead was uh kind of better well what about kiss 
[02:17:00]  kiss bang bang what was that anyone no all right i'm looking at mike woods holding kettlebells  he is an in-shape dude but they they work out with these things that like they look like little  kettles in their weights and they're supposed to be really good to work out with fucking butt plug  he just went he was swinging it between his legs between his legs i want kettlebells  no you don't i certainly do oh michael moore he's gonna be on the show tomorrow speaking of  movies i went last night to see the michael moore movie well you know capitalism is bad he yells and 
[02:17:30]  screams through a bullhorn of buildings like i said and then he likes to put crime scene tape around  massive buildings because you know there's a crime being committed the whole outrageous michael moore  thing like it was a good movie fuck what happened are you in a bad mood no all right i'm not so i'll  i'll talk i'm looking forward to seeing mike again tomorrow it'll be nice to see him you know the thing  is he'll be in here uh tomorrow his his fucking movie uh the first one he did with the guy from 
[02:18:00]  general roger and me roger and me was really fucking good had a concept he wanted an interview  with roger fucking general motors he wanted to fucking get to him and and and the roadblocks  that were put up in between him and the ceo were were it was fun right it's fun to watch uh and then  in between he showed uh the the the workers and what they were going through with the layoffs and the 
[02:18:30]  overseas where the jobs are going that was good but then every other movie he's made so far has tried  to capture that and just been i liked i gotta be honest man i don't agree with everything in his  movies but i i've liked every one of his movies really i really have bowling for columbine was a  fucking propaganda movie that was so bad like at least the first one was like you could tell he's  you know liberal bias but roger and me was just kind of what it was here was a company doing this 
[02:19:00]  shit and he's exposing them then he got this agenda thing where it's like this liberal bias  bullshit that that through editing and clever editing and and you know the whole taking advantage  of the fucking senile uh charlton heston was a bit much your your hero chuck heston he was in charge  of the nra always be head of the nra to me well i tweeted last night i said man we're gonna have a 
[02:19:30]  good interview with michael moore michael moore and anthony tomorrow on the opian anthony show  uh it was all right i mean you know capitalism is bad but he was trying to focus more on the workers  and the employer more than anything in this movie how is he saying capitalism was bad when the whole  country was pretty much you know well he said it it's kind of you know not good anymore because  you got these ceos you know making a shitload of money while their workers are pretty much suffering  to pay their bills and and keep themselves in their own houses yeah that type of thing yeah 
[02:20:00]  yes and you know what he focused on a couple things we brought up on this show i told you before the  show tits ass well uh no no tits or a couple of things there's a cock shot ah no there wasn't uh  the student loan thing yeah yeah how like these these kids i feel bad for anyone that's in college i  really do when i was going to college it's a it's a very long time ago i'm not going to  fucking bullshit and and my student loans at the time were ridiculous but it was nowhere near what 
[02:20:30]  these kids are are leaving school with it's amazing and they have the first thing you learn when you uh  get your diploma and step out of college is debt that is the first thing you learn in life is i'm in  debt i need to get out how does but how does a country we all have our issues but how does a  country allow the young people to start their working lives in debt for close to 100 000 they  said it was the average is 80 to 100 000 you want to keep that's before that's before you even start 
[02:21:00]  day one at your job you're already 80 to 100 000 in the hole that's insane to keep them down  man you want to keep them working man i went i went to suny geneseo and it was cheap at the time  and i was still i still had twenty thousand dollars at least that i had to pay and it took forever  took me 10 years yeah so you actually get a good gig you still be paying that you know what a lot of  people don't get a good gig one of the examples in the movie this woman's like look i gotta admit 
[02:21:30]  i'm a she was a pilot and uh she makes sixteen thousand dollars to fly people from one city to  another sixteen thousand dollars to fly pilot to fly from one city to another obviously it's not  one of the big companies like jimmy pointed out uh before the show to to me yeah what the hell but  it's sixteen thousand second jobs one guy admitted he he's on food stamps because he can't make  enough money flying people from one city to another that's just crazy as the ceos are taking you know  masses uh amounts of bonuses just got peanut salt all over his little pilot uniform because he's eating 
[02:22:00]  those all day in the cockpit yeah i'm starving what kind of shitty fucking place would take care  of management and just leave the workers feeling like pieces of garbage oh my god i can't even  imagine jimmy i was thinking about you last night you were supposed to be my date because my girl had  school and uh there was an empty seat where you were supposed to be sitting and to my right was an old  bag that was uh drinking alcohol the whole time within a half hour of the movie there was that old  hag it was that old hag uh alcohol breath that i had to fucking take in for the rest of the movie 
[02:22:30]  champagne puke breath it was horrendous dude it was horrendous she was she had some kind of tumbler  and she was just uh partaking in the alcohol during the michael moore movie and then some young  kind of uh girl woman whatever she looked like she was college age she could give a shit about the  movie so she picks up her blackberry i think it was a blackberry in this case to see who's texting  her and the old lady actually uh reached over and try to slap it out of her hand said wow put that 
[02:23:00]  away gee and then by the end of the movie she was out cold from the alcohol snoring snoring where half  the audience was laughing and i was i was the one person right next door like this is just great you  know you do go to the bathroom you piss in your fucking coke cup and then you pour a little into her  open snoring mouth if she fucking got all pissy about about checking a text yeah she she was  disturbing more people than the dumb girl with the text yeah yeah i don't want to text in a movie 
[02:23:30]  there as long as it's not fucking neon light coming off of the thing you know got to kind of cover up a  little bit i don't care but uh because it doesn't make noise yeah it doesn't make noise i just don't  want noise put everything on vibrate i don't want to hear the locusts eating the popcorn and all that  shit yeah um oh anyway so the pilot two jobs that some of these people have two jobs so they're now  tired as they're taking you from city to city these are the smaller companies obviously yeah  and she said i'll get back to the student loan thing she goes i owe uh between 80 and 100 by the 
[02:24:00]  time i pay it off with late fees and and uh penalties i figure it'll cost me probably a half million  dollars wow that is her obligation that's a pretty penny for her schooling in the united states of  america so stupid just throwing them all out there today i wonder what his next documentary is going  to be on i think he's done no i think he's hinting that he's done he's he basically made a statement 
[02:24:30]  at the end it's like i'm getting tired it's your turn man i've just inspired people now it's time  for the the next generation to take i wish you guys saw the movie but i actually do too because  he was a nice in person so like i like the guy personally and i like his films but it's about  capitalism and i'm sitting there going okay this movie opens friday and everyone is going to pay so  he could talk about how bad capitalism is shouldn't he give the proceeds of this movie to whatever 
[02:25:00]  some cause it should no michael moore likes his uh cash he likes his nice house he likes his  fucking nice car he loves food well tomorrow's gonna be the day it could get interesting in here  tomorrow we'll have some fun michael moore will be in studio about this time tomorrow so mark your  calendar that's terrible they just they fucking took raises and they leave the employees like  shit that is fucking sick it's disgusting amazing how a company would do that it's terrible 
[02:25:30]  it's not a good example and then it's just no it's it's it's really bad and then that business  they pointed out how you know the banks got all these bailouts and money yeah but they never asked  the banks to tell them how they're going to spend the money so you know then we all saw what they did  the banks continue paying the outrageous yeah they just gave money and said all right start  lending yeah do do whatever you want with this and then they were like well we don't want to lend  because everyone's defaulting so we'll just give the money to each other right that's basically what 
[02:26:00]  some of these banks did all right uh oh my my girl's not in high school she went back to college oh  stop it she went back to college all right why don't we take a quick break opie and anthony 
[02:26:30]  all right we're back i thought it was a read it's only me me and jimmy are just here chatting  chatting chatty cathys yep opie and anthony show pogrom i think opie's on the turlet on the  charlet my grandma used to say that if yeah like bad stomach pains she goes sit on the turlet just sit  on the it's like no i don't have to go my stomach hurts if i have to go i'll sit on the turlet the 
[02:27:00]  charlet by the way speaking of that holy shit i totally got caught up in those goddamn ancestry.com  commercials so last night i'm you know doing nothing kind of hanging around the house i figure i  type it in and check it out and i start popping up like it's almost like a game you start with  obviously like yourself and then you got to put in your parents names and then their parents names 
[02:27:30]  and then like these little information things come up and you click on it and then you'll get  this like list of information of like maybe your father or mother then you got to sort out if that's  really them or not how much does it cost and stuff uh different costs for different things worldwide  one is something like you get a few months free and then it's 29 a month to to check and then you  cancel it once you figure out your whole family tree i guess how far back do you want to go but i  i want to go i was going back to like you know real fucking old dago shit with the boat and 
[02:28:00]  everything and then but but the thing is i don't know i don't like relatives names like after my  grandparents i don't know what they're fucking no one does they're making it up i'm sitting there  trying to remember you and him had the same one i guarantee he'll be like that's my grandfather  what do they think they take you back to eve they didn't register i i i did see a uh uh  uh like a bat in a manifest a a census thing from like 1910 with my grandmother's name on it and 
[02:28:30]  shit it's really weird or maybe 1920 it was what was her name like it was probably a regular name  no it was uh just selly francis there's 200 000 of them but no no because because you piece it  together because you see that one but then you also have to see the one that because she recently you  passed on to the great beyond don't be please uh i always say something else and oh okay uh and 
[02:29:00]  but but it was you know that was her where she died when she died and stuff like that so then you  put that info in and it gives the computer a little more information to work on to maybe get her  husband's information because then it's my grandfather i got my grandfather and i'm sitting  there going well what the fuck was like his mother's maiden name it's like you don't know  no you go back to your grandparents pretty much and then after that no fucking clue who these 
[02:29:30]  people are so i'm working at like a backwards puzzle it's kind of interesting you know you  add the relatives and then you realize you click on this one it's like oh yeah they have kids and  then you put them in and shit what was the most interesting thing you've found so far i haven't  found anything interesting yet uh besides the fact that they there's a lot of information about  everybody out there like ex-wives and really shit like that by the way nine days nine days till the  party nine days till anthony's i'm fucking done party are you really gonna have a party yeah you 
[02:30:00]  should have a party me and danny gonna sing karaoke alone it's gonna be a hell of a fucking time you're  simply the best nine days love song tick tock did you send the check out already though no but  you're crazy it's ceremonial dude all right and i'm keeping that interest until the day has to be  sent out why would i give up uh you know so wow he's happy to be sending your last one i am ecstatic 
[02:30:30]  it is the last one dunsky after many years so even though you said goodbye to this relationship  well over 10 years 1999 you officially say goodbye to it in nine days 1999 how does that make sense  an entire decade a decade you had another long-term relationship in there and then you've had a few  since that i've had i had a complete long-term relationship in there that then ended it's a 
[02:31:00]  different life yeah that was a lifetime ago yes so you're just gonna have the check delivered  what is obama doing in midtown i'm still thinking if i should uh do that well he's running he ain't  running i'm running oh no oh he's going to play basketball with his aids the cops uh that's what  he's probably letterman outside right no he went to a gym to play basketball with this looks like the  side street up by uh oh with his aids that's right with a lot of his guys he's going to play basketball  actually with with guys he works with yeah very cool play a little b-ball gym so you

[02:37:00]  actual fucking what do they call them the premiere the premiere the premiere why can't i be invited to  the premiere i don't need to walk no fuck because they also have a side door for just schmucks like  myself yeah and then take up one of the seats at the actual premiere instead of seeing it in this  horseshit theater near penn station i can tell you why the fuck i'll tell you why all right no publicist  i'm telling you that's that's what because the company a company's publicist is never going to look  out for this show we know that we've we've discovered that publicist would would have that 
[02:37:30]  i don't want to make it clear i don't want i don't want to walk the dumb carpet and i don't  walk the carpet no i would no why not but a little respect where i get to see the movie with  you know michael moore comes in maybe says something before the movie publicist i've been to a couple of  those over the years i'd like a publicist but i'm uh much too high a tax bracket now someone else gets  my publicist some underprivileged family gets a publicist from me well maybe with my raise coming  up um yeah you get a raise in nine days yeah you should actually get a raise in nine days yeah 
[02:38:00]  that's gonna raise that's help that's gonna be right that's gonna feel really good  holy shit nine fucking days but why can't we be invited to the actual premiere been a nightmare  yeah it's a big theater yeah there's a bunch of fucking nobodies in that theater right it's not  filled with like a-listers it's a bunch of schmucks yeah what the fuck whatever what the fuck whatever 
[02:38:30]  so what were you talking about the family trees i yeah i had a family tree thing it's gotta be hard  for like somebody with a name like hughes or you know common pretty common name but mine is like  it's pretty easy i was able to find the old man really quick and then you gotta go through like  the death records it's like click but there it is the death record and then my his mother's death  record then my mother's mother's death record those are the ones you get the most of death records 
[02:39:00]  know what you realize what everyone's dead that everyone's gonna die all the people who died died  died yeah and then a little a little little leaf comes up on the tree if there's info about that  person then you click on it how much is this i was like 29 something uh a month until person but  you get like the first few couple months free or some shit why do you need more than a day to  look this shit up well it takes a while no it doesn't they have all that they're lying to you  no it takes because you got you're hunting it's like a game almost i was saying that's why i was 
[02:39:30]  so interested in it it's not just like ding ding ding ding like you gotta you gotta do some  investigative work you gotta kind of dig in there and and then try to link the people that you're  looking for like all of a sudden there's no info on a person right let's say my grandfather no info on  him on my mother's side then i link up my mom and all her sisters and brother to that right and then i link  up my grandmother to him now all of a sudden the computer is able to look closer and go all right 
[02:40:00]  now we can narrow it down a little more that it's this guy and then you click there and then you get  info on his birth date maybe you put his birth date in and then you get his records of his death  certificate then you can put that shit in so you're just constantly pouring more info on and it opens up  another branch of the tree for little things like that i just thought it was kind of interesting uh you  you know i my mom's side of the family i don't know a thing about no i don't know i don't know  nothing i don't even know my mom's mom's name yeah i don't know what her name was mom's name i know 
[02:40:30]  the last name but i didn't know i don't know what her first name was have an aunt that i haven't seen  25 26 years i don't know shit about that side of the family my brain trying to figure out maiden names  and i don't need to give a fuck i just think it's interesting i want to take it all no no no no but  the other side of the family the huge side yeah i would i would definitely go the same route as you  but you got to kind of look at the other side in order to get the info for the other side which is 
[02:41:00]  fucked up that's where the crazy comes from fuck that yeah fuck those assholes  they're fucking lunatics every single one of them see i want to trace mine all the way back to  the moors and see which shwuggie uh had sex with my great great great great grandmother  it's maybe faster to find which ones didn't and let's be honest here if you continue the moves  if you continue with this thing and you find out that there's some black yeah what goes through your  mind uh be honest a bullet you know i would go i would destroy all records of this like lucas trying 
[02:41:30]  to destroy the star wars christmas special does he not like that oh he hates it then why did he make  it uh money well yeah money at the time i didn't think he knew you know he would  fucking 30 years later he'd still be pumping the shit out but uh wow imagine that i'm going through  the family tree and all of a sudden hmm what is this right tyrone johnson who was he oh my lord 
[02:42:00]  oh jiminy cricket look at this oh oh what if you found out that in some weird way you were  related to obama that would be a bit of a quandary you're in hello mr uh president i'm related to you  i'd like to come in maybe discuss a few things have a beer these people there's somebody on the  instant feedback he says the name dies with him that i always found weird because you got to go back to 
[02:42:30]  the beginning of time let's say the kumias yeah or whatever the name was yep so that started you  had ancestors running around with the dinosaurs or whatever cavemen caveman at some point a caveman  fucked a cave lady right had a cave kid and that cave kid had to survive all the craziness had to  live through everything and how does it all start in the year 2009 for some of these family names well  you made it through the cave man air era era and all that but guess what it ends right here  in the year 2009 that's the year it just stops why didn't you get eaten alive back in the caveman 
[02:43:00]  days that's the year it just but don't you find that fucked up yeah you had ancestors that had to  survive some crazy shit for you to keep that bloodline going and you're just dropping it off the face of  the earth and if they made one dumb move yep within the last thousand years you wouldn't be here yeah  that's fucked up thousand ten thousand hundred thousand years like a hundred thousand years of  fucking and having kids that's a lot of pressure and having kids and then it ends up with you and 
[02:43:30]  you go yeah screw it you fuck it up for everybody yep that's in heaven living together yeah yeah they're  all in heaven we get to live with cavemen in heaven that's gonna be a little awkward yeah  they'll be yeah do they get smart in heaven and and and what is that how are you gonna relate to  your caveman uh relatives in heaven yeah what the fuck is i know you're trying to say hello they're  throwing shit at you yeah i know we're related but could you please not throw shit at me what is 
[02:44:00]  this because when i lived we didn't throw shit at each other is that a different heaven right and  then what happens with people that like they they marry someone they're deeply in love with them  that person dies they they mourn they take time and then slowly they fall in love with someone else  fall deeply in love with that person and then they both die yeah now your original loving wife who  is waiting there in heaven for you and now you got a new chick yeah that's why so you there's heartbreak  up there too there's no heaven can't be doesn't work out logically no as far as we're concerned what 
[02:44:30]  someone someone in your family is up there and they they know that proper english shit and you're  like just a fucking internet douche like yeah video game video gaming douche how are you gonna relate  to these people will you understand like dead spanish people or will you be like what the  fuck is he saying right or do they speak like heaven they speak heaven but then now you got to learn  another language or do you just instantly know it when you get there is one of the miracles you  instantly know which means it just it just doesn't matter but i want to speak english 
[02:45:00]  i kind of like this whatever you do on earth doesn't matter in the end so now what it just  doesn't matter but do you get and what about clothes you gotta hang out with your ancestors that are  wearing like the fucking are they wearing loincloths or suits some are wearing loincloths some are  wearing like dresses to go to the beach some are wearing dumb little speedos where do you get it  where do you get new clothes you can't wear the same thing every day yes you can you're wearing  whatever you died in no yes you are which is great if you see that uncle with a 
[02:45:30]  a fucking self-inflicted gunshot wound in a bra you're like oh no  this doesn't work one of those crime photos come up as you're studying your family tree  there's an old uncle that looks exactly like you but he has a bra and a gunshot wound  laying next to an oldie car outside a restaurant yeah this is embarrassing yeah  time to close my browser i don't um i don't get it unless unless it's this whole uh you end up as a 
[02:46:00]  single energy entity where you're kind of mixed together as a like more of a not so physical but a  mental energy right where you're able to intermingle and connect with these people on on a level but then  again the cavemen they'd be stupid even with their fucking mental energy absolutely so what the  fuck it's dumb it's a spiritual energy anthony i think that's what the key is it's so intelligence 
[02:46:30]  doesn't matter no so what does matter what is spiritual energy yeah that makes but then do you  lose your identity of being you is the energy that makes up james norden uh if that goes into a  collective of of energy from everybody that has passed uh does that mean you're no longer jim  norden you're a spiritual version which takes out your intelligence your wants your your your your 
[02:47:00]  ambitions your so what does that leave just electricity a blob of energy just a big blob of  energy just to where's the fun in that see nothing makes sense everything you mull over in your head  about this doesn't sound fun well i just want if if there's a heaven i just want them to take the fear  away i don't want any more oh oh oh b i don't want any fear i think there's a rock and roll heaven 
[02:47:30]  don't take the uh you know they got a hell of a band yeah yeah really yeah what if you have a wedding  in heaven what what music do you choose from what era you don't get married in heaven why not because  you're a collective of energy everybody's going to intermingle it's like a big orgy of just mental  energy you know jim jeffrey's freaked me out last time he was on the show because they like thinking  about this religious stuff and yeah the afterlife and all that and and he pointed out the fact that  the bible is very local and i went oh yeah yeah it's very local i would why would the teachings of 
[02:48:00]  god be based on like one little area like what was happening what was happening in what is now known as  detroit back in the biblical days okay well the mormons same thing yeah but but the bible's all  about these just three or four little towns in this little area but that's it but the mormons bible  is about jesus and his journeys in the united states nice so uh or whatever you know what was that uh 
[02:48:30]  what you have oh it's like an invasion yeah yeah we were invaded by jesus it was the jesus invasion  kind of like the british invasion yes he came to the united states for the bobby socksers what kind  of haircut did he have that long he already had the long hair yeah that fucking leonard skinner  didn't have the young beatles haircut no no no someone is saying call dr kaku dr kaku sucks a  dick because this guy wow i'll tell you why because this guy assessment of dr kaku it certainly is 
[02:49:00]  because his knowledge makes you not sleep at night i don't need to know what he wants to say about  this bubbles in the universe yeah exactly we're bubbles it is like a river with swirling eddies  i'm not understanding you you can make this a lot simpler i love how he makes it casual he goes no  at the end of your life you turn off like a computer great thanks you turn off did you ever  sweet dreams you ever power down the computer you just hit the off button great not even they 
[02:49:30]  shut off great where it slowly shuts the systems down and he says it casually as he's sipping his  starbucks yes and then you go home at night and you cry like you're eight years old again  thinking about death for the first time what happened right fuck you dr kaku i don't know  no no no fucking hooking up with like your grand and is your grandfather old like is my  grandfather gonna be old and riddled with lung cancer no hope so and if i hope so hope so and 
[02:50:00]  if not can we give it to him how far back do you go like all right let's not have them old and  decrepit and have it lung cancer let's have them go back what what do you go back 10 years is it your  choice right or is it like uh fucking god's choice and is it you know that's a great when you said go  back that's a very good observation i want to take your thought even further certainly your  definition of family so you go to heaven here's my family hey yeah your family's there to greet you 
[02:50:30]  how far back does it go does it go to one cell organism organisms and you have to hang out with  those that crawled out of the fucking water and became a salamander which eventually becomes a hughes  or a kumia or a norton do you have to hang out with those fucks how far back how far back does it  go how far back and if you uh uh if if you were married and your spouse died young and you lived a  long long time and you get up there now you're old and they're young and and like what yeah it doesn't 
[02:51:00]  god's got a lot of stuff to figure out for this to explain because no fucking explanation i've ever  pondered makes any sense or can actually imagine imagine god sits you down and forces you to get  along with your amoeba relatives yeah with a bunch of amoebas but but i have made it possible for you  to skate with them and they just say like you're like hungry hungry hungry this is a blob with almost 
[02:51:30]  eyes i i don't have anything in common with this god excuse me a minute gotta divide okay there he  goes splits in two i gotta talk to two he is this is how annoying you don't want to talk to a  fucking paramecium it doesn't make sense so how far does it go the only thing that makes sense is  what kaku said right the fucking light switch goes off and fucking lower the curtain motherfucker 
[02:52:00]  it's over johnny maybe there's a cutoff what do you mean 19th century and that's it  how would the fuck no why not maybe clears out the old all the there's too much you know it's good  you think it's some fucking guy comes in because god is a hoarder is how it is and says look we have  to clean out everything before the 19th but i like that guy now he's 13th century what are you going  to do with him i gave him a thousand years in heaven it's time for some new people gotta make room up 
[02:52:30]  here you have to really think about this are you going to use that person for anything nobody's  been around so long i just i can't take the chance to stress it is god is a hoarder he's been hoarding  spirits for a long time it's really time to clean this place up yeah his son jesus is just like you  know heaven was great and then something happened and now it's just a mess the spirits are all over  my room isn't even clean anymore and what if god leaves everything everywhere what if god decides  to get a new interest yeah like people are just a hobby 
[02:53:00]  oh this guy has information on the localization of the bible it's like local radio i said that to  jim jeffrey's this bible uh chris in north carolina antonio gregorio yini how are you  ah nice you said my name robert go ahead it's like the movie twins you know so you go back in the day  and whether you say you know eve or whatever she had twins out came arnold and they followed that path 
[02:53:30]  but what they didn't know was all the crap that got sent over the world you know to the other  continents so they focused on that one part of the bible where all that good stuff was happening  and all this shit just kind of took care of itself oh it didn't matter all right they that was the  titular head of uh uh religion and everything that was supposed to be happening was what the bible was  written about and then the rest of the world was just garbage that like hey you come along for the  ride they're like the extras on loss like you have your ensemble cast right and you pay attention to 
[02:54:00]  them and their storyline but then you'll see someone walking behind with a coconut or a  you know they have a piece of bamboo right and they got a story but who gives a shit  yeah i hear you let me say thank you sir rob in the bronx rob a lot of questions that we don't  have answers to of course all right guys i got one more for you you just said uh you know what happens  you get married your spouse dies young you girls what happens to your spouse dies young and then you  both go to heaven who you stuck with you wait your spouse dies young and then what your spouse dies 
[02:54:30]  is young and then eventually you know you breathe whatever all that no and you were you were  technically married in god's eyes so when you die are you gonna be stuck with the eggs oh my god i  have nine fucking days left don't even don't even nine days no that is one cloud i don't want to  revisit because maybe god sits you down and goes you know and you made some weird decisions on earth i i  know what's best for you and i think for eternity look look i want to think that you should i don't 
[02:55:00]  think i don't first of all i don't think god would be making that reunion i think it would be the other  guy oh the devil yeah i think that is more a hell than heaven but um i was never married in the eyes of  god my friend i went to a justice of the peace which uh is not right by uh all right so i think i'm okay  there uh but as far as like family goes who are you saying who are you fucking saying uh and someday 
[02:55:30]  we'll be back together again in the kingdom of uh jesus and that and you're like how are we getting  back together whenever i hear religious people say that when somebody's dying or something it's like  don't worry you'll see them again in the oh will i how how you're probably the way it works is this  these little petty things we have reverend ted family and yes that's the way it works anthony  when you die everybody meets in heaven and chit chats a little 
[02:56:00]  so sayeth the lord so sayeth the lord yes a letter from from from chip to the corinthians  maybe when people go to heaven everybody is as happy to see the new guy maybe there is no sense of  family yeah prior loyalties okay everybody because we're all so spiritually connected it's every year 
[02:56:30]  everybody is welcomed with equal fervor and familiarity all are welcome all are welcome  so you're all welcome spiritually in the sense of there's no more hey i used to know anthony and  open dan it's i i the guy who i never met before i know everything about anyway so i'm a spiritually  connected figuratively that you will meet again in in the great beyond when people say you know  someone's died and it's like don't worry you will be together again they mean in a spiritual collective 
[02:57:00]  we can only comprehend our individual relationships oh so this is something we can't comprehend yet  i'm assuming all right i at least you could deal with that it's too much for you to even understand  everybody knows everybody it's wonderful in heaven the streets are paved with gold  little flecks of it even in your water so sayeth the reverend ted  thank you reverend ted you made me feel a lot better the alone chips of gold in your beverages 
[02:57:30]  you can request them thank you reverend yes you can i was very worried i had a lot of questions  about heaven the letter from hugo to the corinthians you go yes he said i drink is not plain water lord  well oh he was drinking the gold water gold chips in it  and what again happens to somebody that spiritually uh is uh maybe corrupt but not enough to go to hell 
[02:58:00]  they receive a spanking from the lord he rents their bottom that does that sounds a little too uh  i don't know risque it's not risque the lord does not get erections under his holy robes  oh not reverend ted fucking reverend ted rules  uh i hate reverend ted we're missing something obvious you make me feel good why didn't i make you feel  good explain unto me what you mean i'm not feeling this whole unity as a collective i kind of want to 
[02:58:30]  keep my individuality  no huh i don't at all that's very confusing you all of a sudden turned into reverend bob kelly  i don't  i'm gonna go fishing  why would your mic work that's what happens when i try to discuss the lord see the lord  struck down vine microphone are we gonna get electrocuted in here  i hope not there you go oh that's much worse no holy 
[02:59:00]  shit unplug the uh xlr and then just when i was forgetting about the problems we had two  i'm blowing it now they're back and i'm mad again like a roadie  there we go  oh it's the cord oh really you want me to fix it  here we go there we go it's doing the cross oh my god listen to that how annoying is that  listeners wow  that's pretty bad 
[02:59:30]  uh oh this guy saw a ghost when he was a kid  ghosts is this on  i that's what heaven is gregory it's full of ghosts  david washington what's up what's up hey man okay um yeah okay i grew up  around this really  oh shit called uh sunny valley oregon yeah  and uh so it was a different time back then it was like 1980 81 uh me and my sister i was like

[03:03:30]  the way it like raised its arms like that and stuff you know and it was like we saw it and we knew that  it saw us and that's why it reacted that way and then we just kept on playing you know we didn't really  think too much about it and then what happened if we were if we were older we would have yeah  what but then what happened after that yeah what what the fuck happened after the that whole thing  uh we kept playing where were you playing i don't remember i believe we were riding uh 
[03:04:00]  riding their horses yeah but then what happened after you were playing yeah because you had a you  know we fucking i don't know we fucking shit in each other's mouths and all that  shit that's part of the story my friend we've been doing it in our ears for 10 minutes  uh thank you my friends this is a ghost well oh dog shit sniffer writes this story sucks 
[03:04:30]  it's not a bad story sir i mean you went to ghost mountain and saw an apparition what adults  wouldn't want to hear that that sucked it sure wasn't halloween  oh am i still dude i was about to hang up yeah it wasn't halloween oh my god why didn't you  you really all right well all right thank you that's fine this guy nate in a little rock uh  nate what do you got

[03:06:30]  no no it'll be good trust me no all right  hello hello wow what's up says you see it's going good 
[03:07:00]  listen maybe there are like different centuries ahead 19th century 20th century but we know what  different centuries are but that is in heaven then because like 20th century heaven could be better  because there's more shit you know and you know more stuff and and who's and more people more  sexually uh free and whose uh calendar are we going to use because god doesn't acknowledge yeah  centuries because the earth spins around the sun doesn't mean shit what about the rest of the 
[03:07:30]  fucking galaxy universe right all over the fucking space what do you think god has to grab a  fucking sweater when september hits yeah god i just want a hat i want you guys to know that i'm  not a cutter by the way yeah i got cuts all over my hands look 4k this plastic fucking um hard  plastic packaging oh yeah someone has to do something about this i mean i i got close to  cutting my wrists yeah you need patience i got one of those electric toothbrushes right yeah so i was 
[03:08:00]  trying to open up the package i'm caught looking i got cuts all over my hands you need scissors to open  them yeah but sometimes you don't have scissors and you want to get to the product inside so what do  you do you start ripping up trying to do you know ripping apart use a key  use a use a knife use the fuck is the point it's dangerous car tire don't you think it's dangerous  though yes uh especially these sides that are like kind of the razor blades when you cut through that  it becomes a knife yes you could kill somebody with that you could put it right through their 
[03:08:30]  fucking neck and uh and the second you grab and start pulling apart that's what i'm saying oh my  god that's how i got all these finger you could your fingers go flying across the kitchen  i'm saying things still sealed so fucking dangerous and and you don't have a scissor  handy a lot of times i don't understand the clamshell packaging it's very dangerous it's called  clamshell packaging they put everything in a paper sack tell my sack looks now like a paper 
[03:09:00]  sack with oranges in it was everything being stolen that much that they had to put hard plastic around  it what's next plutonium we get it why don't they just nail it to the floor  never notice when you try to steal something you can't when i was a child a guy at the general  store would just leave the pickle barrel open we get it you're old yeah back in the old days you could 
[03:09:30]  just steal something and blame it on the negro  oh they'd usually just pick one up it could be off the hook  isn't it great being white yeah i said get out of the store and get me some sarsaparillo  sarsaparillo is that how you say it it's sarsaparilla he thought so no wonder he never  got me the right thing i always said it wrong sarsaparillo 
[03:10:00]  i fucking love jimmy why is this guy using a can opener to get to his fucking he figured out a way to  open up the clamshell packaging with a regular um little twisty you know can opener yeah great  but you did now look at that part that's the dangerous part look look how fucking yeah and  you still can't get it out oh my god so you still can't get it out you know what else is uh great  now he has to use a knife watch out now he's using all the tools to get to his fucking product 
[03:10:30]  this this has got to be dangerous you know what else is is i just got some lousy dumb little cuts  but i'm imagining it's it's got to lead to stitches they use those industrial strength twist tie things  and batten down your product to the plastic backing also i actually threw the product on the floor  last night i was so pissed and frustrated because i couldn't get to it there you go the guy only had  to use a knife and a can opener to get to his yeah his game uh fucking console fucking whatever 
[03:11:00]  i forgot the fucking controller you just lost interest halfway through that  you ever do that you just lose interest you're like i gotta continue it because we're on radio  you ever lose interest halfway a lot of people say they do that during my segment  andy rudy you think there's a heaven i hope so  andy wasn't prepared for that question obviously and you know how we were just talking about it i was 
[03:11:30]  like you know maybe oh let me ask ed bradley i wonder if you wear your earring in heaven  will i make mundane boring points in heaven  oh that's a good question from reading oh do you think it would hurt to take that plastic and slice  it right over your pee hole oh could you fucking imagine uh here you go see i knew there was i knew  there was something here and my dumb scratches are going to lead to a little topic here this is 
[03:12:00]  this is a quick topic sean and albany go ahead sean yeah i actually cut off a little portion of my  about a little portion but a portion of my thumb with opening a plastic package yeah where it was just  trying to rip put a little cut in it and tried to rip it open and it hit my thumb see it sliced like  the sides underneath the nail like just one side down about halfway down that buckle and it went  straight through the nail to the point where it had to just be taken off and jesus that's the mistake 
[03:12:30]  we all make too because you get a little hole in the plastic packaging and you're like all right i  can now rip this apart it's impossible at the very least they should be allow you to be able to rip  the rest of it open at that point it's razor sharp and it's uh very tough yeah i punch a hole in it  and then i push my erection in and try to use it  imagine that if you had a package you had to open it with your dick how awful that would be  good way i'm gonna kill the joke try christmas morning with four young kids i use a drill and 
[03:13:00]  tin snips to open up their gifts dirty ralph  hmm yeah 10 steps and the twisties you're right there's a like there's 20 twisties on one dumb  fucking toy yeah it's like it's twisted down there oh pain in the ass the logic of that doesn't make  sense but we don't really need to do 20 minutes on this do we never know it's a quick observation  a couple phone calls and we move on that's what i'm gonna be putting my casket i'm just gonna drill  a bunch of holes in the bottom of it and then use twist ties to hold me down 
[03:13:30]  i have a fear of falling out during an earthquake  i don't know why what if you put in the ground askew that's gotta suck kind of leaning maybe they  velcro your body to the bottom of the thing rolls over yeah do they level that bottom out those grave  diggers or they just don't give a shit mexicans don't give a shit they throw that box in the ground  see put some dirt over and they go to lunch yeah i don't care how you're like that little strap 
[03:14:00]  mechanism lowers the coffin in there pretty interesting not really but just use scissors  i said i understand that but sometimes you don't have anything around like that  oh my god oh how bad do you need a brush the electric toothbrush is the best invention ever you  you just sit there you just sit there it's easy it does everything for you like that i don't like  i don't like it that it costs 130 for one of these brushes does it get all over your mirror 
[03:14:30]  i brush in the shower you brush your teeth in the shower hell fucking yeah how nuts are you  no one does that christ i do it on the toilet dude we're gonna rush you in exactly he's got his shoes  on his dress the shower is just water that falls over the toilet so we can  shit brush and watch at the same time have you guys forgotten we do morning radio yes  like a pit it's like a nascar pit stop yeah you do everything in the shower at once i don't shower  in the morning oh well i shower the night before no that's why because i mean i'm not going to 
[03:15:00]  waste another few minutes that i could be sleeping brushing my teeth in front of a mirror when i could  do in the shower while i'm waking the fuck up what about jerk off time in the shower though  jerk off my jerk off time in the shower shower the night before it's way down over the last few  years i can never jerk off in the shower why not easy cleanup and then you get a little shampoo in  the pee hole in it no no no bed are you shampoo  let's say hi to andy in cleveland andy hey guys uh i don't know if you remember but 
[03:15:30]  right before september 11th i think it was a day before two days before uh the news week was so slow  is that i remember the usa today actually led with a story of some ball player some baseball  player stabbing himself in the stomach because he was trying to get a package open yeah because  you put the knife the steak knife to the packaging and if you're not careful man it slices right through  next thing you know it's hitting skin or something yeah that did happen that's right can you imagine  opening that packaging and you fucking jab your eyeball with a piece of that plastic oh no 
[03:16:00]  all right all right thanks sir a lot of components are small so they have to put them in big packaging  so they can't be stolen easily that's like kind of where it started but uh i don't think a game  controller has to be putting that no they don't want people futzing with it either like opening the box  and futzing futzing the fucking opie and nana show i love the nana words every so often he's futzing 
[03:16:30]  with it fix the aerial i have to watch my stories they use it in a bad time though like uh one just  raped in the nursing home they're like yeah a bunch of the orderlies were futzing with her they were  futzing with her going back to the michael moore movie just because uh we had a cleveland call i don't  know if it's a real song but there's a song in the michael moore movie about cleveland it's like  the the song for cleveland is it and it's a goof song and i'm not sure cleveland rocks i'm not sure  if he grabbed it off youtube or if or if he created it for the movie but pretty fucking funny danny if
