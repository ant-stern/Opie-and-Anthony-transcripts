<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion about a face transplant recipient whose face was partially eaten by her own dog while she was unconscious from drug use.  This segued into a frustrated recounting of a negative experience with a 20/20 news crew, who filmed them extensively but used very little of the footage, instead airing an old Howard Stern clip.  They speculated about possible interference. The conversation then shifted to a Japanese news report detailing cultural issues, including a murder resulting from a makeup dispute on a train platform.  The discussion returned to the 20/20 segment, criticizing its dullness and highlighting Jim Norton's profane man-on-the-street interview for the piece.

A significant portion focused on Jim Norton's appearance on a Dateline NBC special about child predators, recounted with comedic emphasis on the extensive footage shot.  They also discussed his appearance on a John Stossel segment, highlighting the disconnect between Stossel's perception of modern stand-up and its use of offensive language. A listener promised to bring a schizophrenic comedian to their "American Mess" segment, sparking discussion of a supposedly inappropriate stand-up performance by Tracy Morgan.

The hosts then reviewed the Rolling Stones' Super Bowl halftime show, expressing disappointment with their song choices.  They critically reviewed various Super Bowl commercials, focusing on their comedic and offensive elements, and discussed the pressure on commercials to ultimately convey a politically correct message despite initial edgier concepts. The segment ended with listener calls discussing their favorite Super Bowl commercials and an unresolved attempt to recall a funny moment from the Super Bowl coverage.  Profanity and offensive material were used throughout.

A subsequent segment centered on a scathing critique of a feel-good Super Bowl piece about a Pop Warner Challenger League for children with disabilities.  The hosts and callers repeatedly used derogatory terms ("retard," "retarded") to describe the children and their play.  Audio clips from the piece were interspersed with the hosts' and callers' mocking commentary. A caller, Nick from Canada, briefly compared North American and UK television advertising.  Schizo Bill from Cleveland then called in with stand-up material, which was met with mockery. The hosts discussed Howard Stern's petition to the FCC about pirate radio stations playing his Sirius show, and played a short, humorous Steve Martin clip. The segment concluded with a discussion between Bill Burr (in studio) and Patrice O'Neal (calling in) regarding a contentious appearance Patrice had on the Mancow Muller Show, with accusations, justifications, and insults flying between them.

Another segment detailed a heated argument between Patrice O'Neal (calling in) and Bill Burr (in studio) regarding O'Neal's recent appearance on the Mancow Muller Show. O'Neal felt Mancow was disrespectful, cutting him off and insulting him. Burr, who was present during the call, was accused of not defending him sufficiently. The conversation escalated into a shouting match, fueled by listener emails and comments, with accusations of microphone manipulation and misrepresentation. Clips from the Mancow show were played, and the discussion included a reference to a Dave Chappelle skit and Burr's alleged reaction. The segment ended with apologies from O'Neal, a challenge to Mancow for an on-air debate, and Opie and Anthony's assessment, largely blaming Mancow.  Numerous insults and racial slurs were used.

A further segment began with a discussion of the negative reception they received from other radio personalities, noting the backlash faced by their comedian friends due to the show's controversial nature. They boasted about their success despite this negativity and predicted their competitors' downfall.  The conversation then shifted to Opie's Super Bowl party, focusing on a prank involving E-Rock's buffalo wings, where many were secretly disposed of to create a false impression of their popularity. This was recounted humorously.  The discussion continued to Opie's large television, his upcoming move, and the difficulties of moving it, segueing into a discussion of Opie’s and Anthony's furniture and Anthony's headboard and sexual preferences.  Studio guest Jim Gaffigan was mentioned early on and featured prominently later, discussing his Super Bowl commercial, his new DVD *Beyond the Pale*, his comedic career (including a clip of an embarrassing early radio appearance with Opie), fatherhood, MySpace usage, and his stand-up routine. Other brief topics included a listener call about a restaurant and a discussion of "double talk."  Finally, a listener-submitted song parody with inappropriate lyrics was played.

The final segment covered Opie’s upcoming theater dates (Seattle, Portland, Albany, and Philly). A bit about a "porridge Nazi" who kills Jews was mentioned. They played a game identifying whether an obituary subject (Patrick O'Neill) was a notable enough celebrity for a bit. This led to discussion of a song about Cuban boat people, described as involving much grunting and hesitant approval from Anthony. The segment concluded with a live appearance by Jim Gaffigan, promoting his new DVD, “Beyond the Pale,” and repeatedly mentioning his website and MySpace page, with much joking and interruption from the hosts, including frequent shouting of his name.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  And that's how we begin another week of broadcasting. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you.  Good morning.  Good morning.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Good morning.  Ding.  Spreading across America.  Thanks to XAM satellite radio.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:05:00]  It's a virus.  It's the ONA virus.  And I think everyone's a little sleepy today.  Uh-oh.  Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays.  The Mondays.  Mondays.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  I don't think we have figured out the face transplant yet.  We're working on it.  Well, she kind of got a Billy Idol thing going with her lip a little. 
[00:05:30]  She looks like Hillary Clinton with Down syndrome.  Yeah.  She did that stupid.  There you go.  That is just creepy to know that face was on somebody else before you.  First look at face transplant woman.  Breaking news.  Does the mouth move?  No.  It kind of just goes.  You ever see a horse's lip when you have an apple in your hand and they're going for it?  That lip goes like. 
[00:06:00]  First.  That's kind of what a lip does.  That's all it does?  Yeah.  But considering what it was like.  Yeah.  I mean, that's a miracle.  She was apparently some kind of real drug addict.  And she had done some drugs and passed out on the floor of her home.  And when this happened, what are the odds that your dog comes over and eats your face?  The dog, her own dog, ate her face when she was passed out from drugs. 
[00:06:30]  So you've got to be really fucking.  I've been in some states over drinking where, you know, it's taken a few shakes to get me up.  But if a dog starts dining on your face, you're probably going to wake up.  She must have really been out of it.  I'm thinking maybe some vomit was involved.  Well, the dog must have been really hungry, too.  Looks like she wasn't feeding this dog.  She probably didn't feed the dog.  She passes out on the floor and probably vomits a little bit. 
[00:07:00]  So the dog starts out on that.  I'm just speculating.  But, you know, because why would a dog just dig right into your face?  Probably a little vomit.  A little tasty for the dog.  He gets done with the vomit.  What are you going to do?  Maybe there's some more in there.  And all the time she had to get up at six in the morning and stand in the rain while this thing shit into a bush.  Right.  How does it repay her?  Instead of barking for help like Lassie, it eats her face.  Lazy dog.  So, I don't know.  After a while, they figured they'd try to give old gravy train face a face transplant. 
[00:07:30]  And it worked so far.  Well, they said it worked, but...  They're considering what it was?  Yeah, but they're not sure if it's going to just start rotting off her face.  Well, that's true.  They had a couple of rejection problems already, but then they give her the drugs and the steroids,  and that's kind of stopped that from happening.  But there's nerve problems like her lips don't quite move right, so they got to do that.  You got to start somewhere, I guess. 
[00:08:00]  It's the first one.  It's the first one.  We'll figure that out, too.  You know what the first car was like?  Right.  Oh, gee, no air conditioning.  I think they steered it with like a handle.  It wasn't a steering wheel.  It takes a little while.  Screw that.  What about the first radio show?  Right.  Hello.  Are we on?  That's pretty much it.  Right.  And who are you talking to?  Nobody.  Nobody.  Because no one had radios yet, you silly person.  And they figure it out.  Everything takes a little time.  All right.  I want to have a face transplant.  I want to have Opie's face put on mine. 
[00:08:30]  And then just go to the bank and make a big withdrawal.  And then have my face put back.  Jimmy Dorn, everyone.  We could just have my ex-wife, her face put on, make a big withdrawal.  My account.  I'll send you checks every few months.  Let's go all the way over there.  And say hi to Tony in Vancouver.  Ooh.  He's way over there.  Tony.  Hey.  What's up?  Uh, yeah.  I saw Jimmy on, uh, 2020 Friday night.  And then I...  Well, you must have had a freeze frame on your phone. 
[00:09:00]  T-phone.  2020 could go suck our dicks.  Holy crap.  They wrecked our show Monday.  Now we can say it.  2020 wrecked our show last Monday.  It was very distracting to have...  It's very distracting to have anybody come in here with a camera crew.  Ever.  We don't give a shit if there's 20, 30 people in the studio as we're trying to broadcast.  Because we know those people are into what we're doing.  They're going to react to what we're doing.  But then, uh, when you get a camera crew, like 2020, and they're just staring, making  sure the lights are right, making sure they're getting the right shots, not paying attention 
[00:09:30]  to actually what we're doing.  It's very distracting.  And any camera crew coming in here is distracting.  But, uh, for the most part, they're in and out in, the most, an hour.  They come in for an hour.  They ruin the show, whatever.  Be distracting.  But then they're gone.  They were here for the entire program, beginning to end.  And used nothing.  They used nothing from the studio.  And then, uh, Jimmy had to spend the rest of the day with 2020, right?  That was another three or four hours easily, right? 
[00:10:00]  Yep.  And they used Jimmy on the street in the, uh, the root piece for 20 seconds, 30 seconds.  My guess is that, uh, somebody saw it and said, wait a minute, these guys?  Uh-uh.  I'll bet you the only reason they even left me in at all was because they already shot  it and they had a deadline.  I bet they could have even reshot my stuff.  They probably didn't realize my association with the program after, uh...  Jimmy's thinking this is payback from the assault on the media campaign.  ABC.  Yeah.  Well, we fucked with ABC pretty bad.  Yeah.  Absolutely. 
[00:10:30]  The assault on the O&A show?  I think they're getting us back.  The news comes in and fucks with us during our four hours.  That was a long assault on the O&A show.  I'll tell you why I think they're getting us back because, like you said, they filmed  us for four hours.  It was about rudeness and cursing.  And here they are filming satellite radio where you're allowed to curse openly, which  would be perfect for the story saying...  Very rude.  You know, rudeness in America has gotten so bad that now you could, uh, listen to people  cursing and being rude on your, on your radio show, right?  Right.  So they don't use any of it, even like just basic setups and you cursing and what have 
[00:11:00]  you.  So they blow us off even though they have four hours of brand new, up to the minute footage.  And what do they do?  They play a clip of Howard Stern from seven years ago.  And they did show the meter like you said they would.  Right.  Oh yeah, the VU meters are always shown.  So that makes me think there was something going on behind the scenes because, uh, they  had a dig to go get an old clip of Howard like seven, eight years ago when they had  fresh video of us doing our thing cursing, which was perfect for the piece. 
[00:11:30]  Then they didn't use it.  I don't think it was the guys that were in here.  I think it probably, somebody that probably saw it and went, uh-huh.  Oh no, these guys had nothing to do with that.  They're soldiers.  But we're not stupid.  Something went down after, uh, after they left here and went into the editing room.  That was such a non-story.  Like, I, it was such a nothing piece.  I didn't get it.  And it, it seemed like what they had was a bunch of these similar pieces done by different 
[00:12:00]  producers and, and everything all over different parts of the world, really.  And just kind of found some common thread to throw them all together with B-roll.  Right.  That they did maybe from other stories.  Because they had a, Japan.  Who's going to take this story, this nothing story, and kind of send a whole crew to Japan  to do that?  I think they had people in Japan and, you know, were doing another story and, uh, got some  footage of some Japanese youth dressing ridiculously, by the way.  What is going on over there? 
[00:12:30]  They're bored.  And then they had, they had some Japanese Miss Manners teaching the manners from the  1600s, the Ming Dynasty, uh, of manners, how to sit on a pillow, eat with chopsticks.  Yeah.  And then they had the youth of Japan running around, you know, smoking in the street, drinking  coffee in the street, which apparently is taboo.  Really?  Yeah.  They get a bunch of Starbucks going up and the youth of Japan is going around with these,  uh, Starbucks cups on their way to work and stuff. 
[00:13:00]  And, and the elders are very upset by this because it's rude.  It's not something they do in their culture.  Eat in the streets.  You're not supposed to take, uh, like McDonald's or something out into the street and eat.  A lot of rules over there.  Uh, there was a whole, uh, controversy.  Some woman, uh, older woman pointed out that a younger girl was putting makeup on, on the  train platform and got into a scuffle with her.  And the younger woman pushed her into the side of a moving train and, uh, she died.  That was like a big story. 
[00:13:30]  More so that she was putting the makeup on and this whole cultural difference.  But I bet she never put makeup on that way again, did she?  You know, for, for all its harshness, she was taught a lesson.  Well, she was the one that pushed the old lady into the train so she could still put  makeup on.  Yeah.  The old lady ain't putting nothing on.  Oh, I stand corrected then.  The old lady got, got her comeuppance.  Her comeuppance.  Find your business, your old bag.  Busy body.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, Tony, uh, you started this boring, uh, this boring, uh, conversation.  It really is awful. 
[00:14:00]  I want to, I want to thank you for calling the program, Tony.  All right.  Did you have a comment about, uh, Jimmy on 2020?  That's what kind of a dull fucking story that 2020 was.  You can't even make something up on the radio.  I'm not making fun of you.  I'm just saying in general, it was like, who cares?  Tony.  I think everybody's missing, by the way, the fact that my acting as, as the interviewer,  you thought it was an interviewer.  You were.  Oh, yeah.  I was not an interviewer.  It's Thornton.  Oh.  Yeah, it wasn't, it wasn't too obvious that something was going on, that you were trying to hoodwink people.  Yeah, there was.  And then they had, they had the nerve to say, most people were too scared to, you know,  ran away. 
[00:14:30]  Of course, look what you looked like.  What was with the glasses?  The glasses.  Whose idea was that?  They were not believable.  Huh?  There was a camera in them.  They never used that camera shot.  Oh, there was a camera in them.  Those were a mounted camera.  Unless they had problems with the audio of the camera, but I was actually looking right  at people, and it was perfect video.  Yeah.  That's why I had those on.  It was, it was a camera inside of them.  Perfect video, but the glasses looked awful.  We only got a couple people that were offended.  Most were not.  Tony?  Yeah.  Once again, do you have anything on this?  Yeah, well, there was obviously nothing going on with 2020, so I flipped over to Dayline, 
[00:15:00]  and Jimmy, there you were on there, catching a child predator special.  By the way.  You said I was getting arrested.  That would have been funny.  I know.  You goose.  By the way, we have 38 tracks from that Dateline special.  I gotta say, I kind of did chuckle, because one guy that walked in, I was like, oh my god,  it looks like Jimmy.  There was just some guy with similar features that walked into the house.  If somebody walks in and has the cops who are arresting him, plugs their gig.  Yeah.  Well, we have 38 tracks. 
[00:15:30]  Nathaniel comes up to me, he goes, we have 38 tracks on this predator thing from Dateline.  I go, can you cut it down?  Because we're trying to get to more material on this program.  He goes, tell you the truth, man, all 38 are great.  It's great.  I watched it.  All right.  I watched it beginning to end, and when an hour was up, I saw like it was creeping up  on, I guess it started at 8, and it was creeping up on 8.50, 8.55, and I was bummed, because  I thought it was over. 
[00:16:00]  And then I was like, oh my god, it's two hours.  Joy.  Happy, happy, joy.  It was such an entertainer.  They have a hit on their hands.  They could do this every week.  It could just be a reality show.  I think they got about 10 of those in the can, by the way.  They got it.  This was three.  They knew they were onto something.  I bet you they filmed a lot of them.  And they've gotten more pedophiles this time than they got last time.  They captured over 50 of these pedophiles going into this one house over the course of  three days.  This time the police were involved, because last time a lot of people were frustrated 
[00:16:30]  that it was just Dateline.  Right.  So these kid touchers would walk in, they'd talk to them, they'd leave, and they're gone.  Well, they would finally say, you're free to go.  Yeah.  And they would just run out of there, and they were done.  Never to be seen against, most of them.  They're filming so many.  These guys are actually molesting kids now to get their SAG cards.  Get their credits off.  Whatever gets you your SAG card.  I've been seen on Dateline.  Did you see me on Dateline?  Yeah.  Seen on Dateline. 
[00:17:00]  Got to put together your little resume and tape.  They're actually more impressive performances than Voss's Lenny Bruce.  I'd rather get busted in the kitchen.  Less offensive.  Hey, I like your theory.  With all the coverage we got for that dumb Sex for Sam thing, man, we have some impressive  resumes.  Yes, we do.  We've appeared on many national TV programs.  Yes.  I'm getting a Diet Coke.  Come on in.  Right.  All right.  We'll get to that in a little while.  Yeah, it was really good.  Back it up.  We got the audio of Jim Norton from 2020. 
[00:17:30]  Here's a little Jimmy Norton on 2020 this past Friday.  These days, however, many of the comedians seem to believe that they have to add X-rated  language.  I'm sorry.  I busted.  These days?  These days.  These days, comedians have to pepper it up with the language?  What is it?  These days?  75?  Yeah.  And that was Todd Lynn.  I just went to see a Lenny Bruce play, and the whole thing there was that he got, you  know, arrested for saying cocksucker.  Yeah.  It's not these days, Stossel. 
[00:18:00]  He is so fucking out of touch, that guy.  John Stossel thinks he's a know-it-all.  Yeah.  These days, comedians are peppering their act with language?  These days, they are.  Are you kidding me?  These days, however, many of the comedians seem to believe that they have to add X-rated  language.  I'm sorry.  If I said n*** a lot, I meant to.  It's routine now in Comedy Club.  Holy shit.  It's routine now.  Someone has to call this guy out on this. 
[00:18:30]  Like it's a brand new thing.  Like Richard Pryor wasn't doing that.  George Carlin wasn't doing that.  Red Fox.  Andy Dyson Play wasn't doing that.  Red Fox.  Talking the early 70s and stuff.  Red Fox tearing it up.  These days?  These days.  When I first started in 1990, you didn't say damn on a stage.  We couldn't even say water closet.  Remember that old gag?  You couldn't say water closet on national television. 
[00:19:00]  That's right.  You had to tell your mother you were going to go drop a deuce.  Right.  You got to go to the shitter.  Mr. Parr.  I got to bring the Cosby kids to the pool.  Everyone knew what it meant.  These days.  All right.  Mr. Parr.  I guess everyone was doing Seinfeld's act until these days.  These days, however, many of the comedians seem to believe that they have to add X-rated language.  I'm sorry.  If I said n*** a lot, I meant to.  It's routine now in Comedy Club. 
[00:19:30]  If we make funny, we're just kidding, right?  Because you don't call a whore a whore.  Right, princess?  That's okay.  People laugh, but shouldn't they be outraged by the coarse language?  Yes.  The club let me ask them about that.  You're here at a comedy club.  It's kind of rude what they're saying.  Hold on.  When he was on stage at the comedy club, he's holding the mic.  He was absolutely, he was out of that reporter persona and trying his best to fit in as one of the guys.  Yeah.  Like he was loose working the crowd. 
[00:20:00]  It wasn't standing up there and going, you, sir.  He's leaning over, talking to the people like he was working the crowd as a comic.  Sleeves rolled up?  Yeah.  His shirt sleeves all rolled up.  I'm ready for some business.  You know, I could do this.  I think I got a calling in comedy.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  Shut up.  Stuffed shirt.  You're here at a comedy club.  It's kind of rude what they're saying.  No.  Why not?  They're saying s*** all the time.  It's funny. 
[00:20:30]  Another non-story.  Another non-story.  Non.  You'd be surprised.  He's shocked that she's not offended by the language.  Well, at a comedy club.  2020 should have done this because, I mean, it's not like there's anything going on with  the Muslims over a cartoon.  So it's kind of good that they do the whole thing on, did you get offended at the stand-up  in New York?  And in all fairness, the cartoon thing happened after they taped this special.  Right.  Jimmy.  Well, you know what?  Sometimes you have to go back to the editing room.  I would love to know. 
[00:21:00]  You're right, though.  It's...  And I found out with all the credits that rolled after how many people it took to throw  this together.  Just hundreds and hundreds of people.  Producers and their little interns and everything.  For nothing.  We still haven't got to Jimmy's part, by the way.  Oh.  And there's only 58 seconds left in the clip.  I look like a reporter.  I mean, you'd think that I was asking questions.  When you come in here, you expect to hear some of that.  So it's not offensive.  But if I'm in the grocery store... 
[00:21:30]  Right.  Context matters.  How would you feel if, on the street, a survey taker came up to you and asked...  Like, a lot of people feel it was f***ed up what the president did.  Do you feel that President Bush overstepped his boundaries?  Because everybody that walks by is f***ing 90.  So I'd like to get a couple of younger people.  The questioner's actually comedian Jim Norton, who on this day is pretending to be taking  a survey on current events, like the war.  He sprinkled his questions with curse words so we could gauge people's reactions.  Do you see any end in sight, or is this f***ing thing going to drag on forever? 
[00:22:00]  We were surprised that most people were not offended.  I wasn't offended because I actually come from a family that uses a lot of cursing.  Some picked up his curses in their answers.  Do you think Saddam Hussein is going to be able to get a fair trial, or is that going to  be a f***ing storm?  It's going to be a f***ing storm.  Only a few were repulsed.  You didn't want to hang out with him.  You wanted to get away as quickly as possible.  She was running down the floor.  Not by the language.  Repulsed by Jimmy Norton.  And I wasn't starting off with cursing.  I would ask actually a legitimate question.  Can I ask you a couple of questions about the war?  You gotta do that.  Some of them were like, where are you from?  I'm like, St. John's. 
[00:22:30]  They all thought it was legitimate until they got there.  And John Stossel's like, and they even answered by cursing back at him.  No, they were given one of the two answers you gave him.  That was one, I actually asked a lot of different questions, but that was one woman who actually  answered me back.  But she wanted to talk.  She just wanted her opinion heard.  She had no idea she was being filmed.  Yeah.  She just repeated what you said.  If it's going to be a f***ing storm.  And she goes, yeah, it's going to be a f***ing storm.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Congratulations to Jimmy, though.  Is that all?  That was it.  Why, you didn't see the piece? 
[00:23:00]  No, I did.  You certainly did.  I was hoping there was something on my TiVo.  I'm like, I must have skipped over that big hunk.  You taped it and everything.  Yeah.  That's all saved on your DVR.  It won't be full of TiVo.  People were sending files of it on the message boards, and they were like some of the smallest  video files I've ever received.  Here's Jimmy.  I'm like, what's this?  It's 1K.  I want to dial up, and it took five seconds to download.  By the way, you nailed it on Friday.  You said they wouldn't use any of the studio footage.  Yeah, you could just tell. 
[00:23:30]  I said they were going to use like five seconds just for a quick show.  No, not even the pan of the Opie Anthony sign.  Nothing.  And then over to Jimmy.  Well, I guess they got us back.  Oh, well.  You got us.  You got us back for the assault on the media thing.  I think that had something to do with it.  I think you're right, Jimmy.  Let's say hi to Bill in Cleveland.  Bill, what's going on?  Hey.  What's going on, Opie?  What's up?  Hey.  Are you guys still doing American Mess this Friday?  Well, we did it last Friday, but no one showed up.  And we had a few people that promised us they were bringing people by. 
[00:24:00]  Well, I will promise that I am bringing a schizophrenic person by.  Is he one of those schizos that are always schizo?  He's a schizophrenic comedian.  He's very funny.  He's very funny.  What's a little of these nuts being comics?  A schizophrenic comedian?  What do you mean?  Like he does stand-up.  I know what a comedian means, sir.  I mean, it was the other part that I was asking about.  You mean alone or in clubs, sir?  Explain this. 
[00:24:30]  Is his name Tracy Morgan?  Because I saw Tracy Morgan on Saturday night at Caroline's, and I think he's losing it.  I think he's schizo.  Really?  Holy shit.  What happened?  I talked to him after the show, and he's cool with us and stuff.  He just felt like he couldn't compete with guys getting stung in the ball bag.  It's not a matter of competing.  It's just kind of hanging.  I thought that was perfect material to play off, but considering the act I saw on Saturday night,  it's right down his alley of what he's doing these days.  Really? 
[00:25:00]  He was really funny in the beginning.  He had some great airplane stuff that's a little different than what other guys are doing  with the whole terrorist thing.  And then he went as dirty as I've seen in many, many years, just as blue and in the gutter  as possible, to the point where there's white chicks in the front row and stuff, and he goes  to one girl.  He goes, hey, you ever see a black man's pubes?  And you think, oh, that's kind of funny.  Then he pulls his pants down to show his black pubes to this chick, and then he starts kind 
[00:25:30]  of kissing another one on her neck and stuff, trying to turn her on, and then goes, hey,  I got your nipples hard.  And it was just like, what?  So he does his act up until he's out of act, and then he sexually assaults the crowd?  Is that...  He...  Well, I don't know.  I enjoyed about 20 minutes out of the hour.  Is this intern wearing camera glasses?  Are you, like, doing an undercover report?  That's kind of...  Yes.  Kind of looks like Jimmy glasses there. 
[00:26:00]  It's an expose.  Nerds and radio.  What's that?  It's sort of like bang glasses, don't you think?  Yeah, a little bit, but the frames a little...  They're more like what Jimmy was wearing on Friday's 2020 piece.  On Friday.  Well, thank God we asked you to sit down.  Yes.  It's not too uncomfortable now.  Why are you fighting with Larry the Cable Guy?  Because he sucks.  Dude, you really didn't need to sit down, trust me.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, you might want to stand back up.  All right, be good.  All right.  Be good.  What's your name?  Sean.  All right, goodbye.  Sean.  He's been working here about three or four weeks, and he's thinking this is his moment. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  He thought that was your moment.  That was it.  That was the moment that turns you into Than or Danny or Travis or Derek.  There's just a quick question.  He's like, oh my God, here it is.  Here it is.  Here it is.  I sit down.  I'm being discovered.  Talking about my glasses, now I sit in the seat, pull the mic down.  I went from getting breakfast for the boys and coffee for the boys to a part of the show.  Here it is.  Most of the guys come in and they stand there.  Right.  Don't even sit during their first appearance. 
[00:27:00]  He probably played that moment out in his head many, many nights at home.  What's it going to be like?  What am I going to be called in for?  I'll sit down.  I'll look comfortable.  I won't look nervous.  Stand up.  Get out.  Get out.  Stop trying to be interesting.  Beat it.  One more sugar.  Comment on your glasses, sir.  Anyway, Bill, Cleveland, the American mess will happen once again this Friday.  But if you're going to come down, if you're going to promise you coming down, you've got  to come down.  Yeah.  I will.  I will.  We'll be there. 
[00:27:30]  And what's so weird about this guy?  He's just a really odd guy.  He's a gambler.  He spends all his money.  He won like $50,000 in the lottery.  And then he spent all of it within like six months.  He's just a mess.  He's a mess of a person.  He got hit by a car.  And that's how he became a schizophrenic.  His parents like locked him up because he wanted to call in radio shows.  My name is Earl Plot.  His parents locked him up because he wanted to call in radio shows?  Yeah, because he had a sense of humor about his disability. 
[00:28:00]  And his parents thought that was disgusting and sick.  So they put him in a...  Are you driving from Cleveland?  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't you have the guy call beforehand?  Yeah.  Let's get him on the phone and do a pre-interview.  We'll decide if it's worth the ride.  All righty.  Yeah.  Have him call the show later today.  Tell him we have Sudoku questions, sir.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to Dave in New York.  Dave, what's up?  Well, I just want to let you guys know that you made that guy just famous right there.  Why?  Because you made a nice little point out of him. 
[00:28:30]  Why is he famous now?  Because you made a little scene out of this guy.  Come on, guys.  Who's the caller from Cleveland?  I forgot all about that guy already.  No, not that guy.  Who?  The guy with the glasses.  Oh.  Oh, the intern?  There you go.  The intern.  You gave him his five minutes of fame.  Do you know something?  I've already forgotten his name.  I'll be honest.  Was it Scott?  Sean.  Oh, okay.  Sean?  Was it really Sean?  I think so.  I already, how many seconds passed? 
[00:29:00]  It could be measured in seconds.  I forgot his name.  I was going to bet you if you knew his name.  No.  That was an easy bet.  No.  Because of you guys, I'm going to remember that intern.  All right.  His name is Sean.  Yeah.  I knew it was an S.  He'll be Steve.  All right.  Exactly.  I have no idea.  Hey, Sparrow.  All right, guys.  Punch it up.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Nova Scotia.  It's always fun to talk to Nova Scotia.  Ooh.  Brr.  Ian, what's up?  Nova Scotia?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just wanted to point out, I guess, just back there on the program, but I thought it was 
[00:29:30]  priceless that after every pervert that he talked to, he would use the term, you're  free to go, only to fucking go out and get arrested.  I mean, the joy, fear factor must have been just fucking priceless.  Yeah, the reporter's a sick fuck, too, because he's like, you're free to go.  Yeah.  You know, and then the relief, the prayer is feeling like, oh, this is all it is?  Okay.  That could have been bad.  All right.  I know I'm going to be on a national show.  It's a video.  So, but at least I'm not going to jail.  Okay.  I can deal with this. 
[00:30:00]  I'll come up with some crazy excuse for my family and friends.  Right.  Yeah.  And then it's like, oh, thank God.  He walks out of the house.  Nah, sorry.  Oh, no.  Who are these guys?  Right.  Maybe they're here for someone else.  We're going to get into that audio in a little while, too.  Well done, guys.  Take a reason.  Thank you, Ian.  Just kind of warming up here.  Well, I guess we got to talk about the Super Bowl.  Oh, there's the Rolling Stones.  They were terrific at halftime.  What a shock they started with Start Me Up.  Hey, I had a little Super Bowl party at my crib. 
[00:30:30]  I want to know how that went.  Little was the good word.  Jimmy.  You entertained.  And just before the Stones hit the stage, Jimmy's like, if they fucking play Start Me Up,  I'm throwing beer bottles through your TV.  Oh, shit.  And I'm like, but Jimmy, you don't drink.  And he goes, exactly.  That's how angry.  I like the Stones.  But do you have to do every fucking?  It's not one of their best songs.  I'm sorry.  It's not.  It's a big hit.  It's the biggest hit ever.  But you know what?  Which is ridiculous.  Mama's Little Helper is a much better song.  Or Mother's Little Helper.  Yeah, whatever.  But Jimmy. 
[00:31:00]  That's the hip-hop version.  Yeah.  But you got to understand they're not going to do any of those songs for halftime at the Super  Bowl.  Well, the hip-hop version of Mama's Little Helper, Mama's Little Helper is the government.  No, why not?  They could do that.  They're the Stones.  They could do whatever they want.  It's the fucking Super Bowl.  And it's the new Super Bowl where everything has to be beyond safe.  Everything's safe.  They put them on a delay.  Thank you, FCC.  And thank you, government.  We're all safer because you're watching out for us. 
[00:31:30]  Everything's safe.  The performance, safe.  The commercials, safe.  People used to talk about the commercials a lot more than they do these days.  Now, it was just, eh, they stink.  They were like average good commercials.  You see them on TV all throughout the year.  Well, just during regular TV viewing, you see a commercial like, oh, that's kind of funny.  Yeah, get a little chuckle.  That's what we had last night.  Nothing that really stands out where you're talking about it over and over today.  One funny one, and they had to ruin it at the end. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, we were yelling and screaming at the party.  Which one?  The one where they're playing touch football, and the girl gets creamed.  She gets tackled brutally by her boyfriend, and he taunts her.  It was really funny.  It was really funny.  And we're like, yes, very cool.  This is the type of commercial you want to see on Super Bowl Sunday.  And then the end of the commercial, he's sitting at the bar, like, bragging, more or less, with his beer.  Was it a beer commercial?  I don't even know.  And all of a sudden, she comes out of nowhere and tackles him back.  It's like, oh, why?  She's got to get him back.  She had to get him back, because you had to show that the lady wins. 
[00:32:30]  She was empowered in that moment.  Fucking awful.  It was really great when he tackled her.  That was like a Daryl Stingley-type tackle.  You know, she should have been shitting into a bag for the rest of her life after he fucking hit her like that.  It was so nice to finally see.  Because there's all these guys getting hurt in commercials, and they should be.  It's funny to watch people get hurt in a commercial.  Yeah.  But God forbid it's abroad.  But why does it always have to be PC in the end, when they attempt to be a little edgy?  Because our country stinks.  And I turned right around to Jimmy, because I knew. 
[00:33:00]  I'm like, look, they had to go there.  They couldn't just keep it as it was, her just getting smeared, which made a very, very funny commercial.  Well, they also had to show that she was okay.  Let's show she's okay.  Yeah.  I don't know, because somebody might think that she's really hurt.  Yeah, she could be laid up in a hospital while this guy, this insensitive man, is drinking.  I'll guarantee you, one dummy mentioned domestic violence.  Well, alcohol and violence against a woman.  I don't know if I like that in a commercial. 
[00:33:30]  Well, how about if we show her tackling him back?  Hey.  That works.  She's okay.  Let's go to Mr. Motherfucker from whackbag.com.  Yeah, I'm just wondering, how fucked up is it that the Rolling Stones are considered the safe deck these days?  It's not really fucked up, though.  They've been around for 40-some-odd years now.  Yeah.  The performance was good.  It was creepy when they came out and said, we could have performed this next song at the first Super Bowl.  I'm like, holy shit.  Wow.  Because you see the footage of the first Super Bowl, and that seems like a million years ago now, right? 
[00:34:00]  Too much fucking perspective.  And it was about satisfaction.  Mick Jagger says, we could have played this at the first Super Bowl.  And the song actually came out a year before the first Super Bowl.  Did it?  Wow.  And we just celebrated the 40th Super Bowl.  That's fucked up.  The first Super Bowl, no leather helmets in that one, right?  No?  The gif wasn't running around with a leather helmet.  But Ben was all excited that the Rolling Stones got the nod for the halftime show.  And I'm like, why are you excited? 
[00:34:30]  They're going to play Start Me Up, Satisfaction, maybe Brown Sugar.  No, they didn't do that one.  Then they did some crappy song from their new album, and it was done.  And nobody wanted to hear that new song.  No.  And where's Ben?  I don't know.  Where is Ben?  Nothing sounds good in that atmosphere.  Ben was texting us with just nonsense.  Well, that's what he does.  At one point, he just texts us and goes, Jay Moore, two commercials already.  Like, yeah.  Yeah, watching it.  Yeah.  First of all, that song, The Paper's Wrong, Satisfaction came out in 64, not 67 or whatever. 
[00:35:00]  What was the first Super Bowl?  No, no, dude.  No, they were right.  They said the song came out a year before the first Super Bowl.  So that would have put it at like 65, 64.  Okay, no, no, but The Paper said The Paper was wrong today.  The Paper said it came out in 67 or something.  All right.  The Paper's Wrong?  Stop it.  And they were wrong about something else.  They have a quote from Mick Jagger.  He was like, you know, saying he was talking in between songs.  Sounded like he's never seen a football game in his life.  Yeah.  And he goes, hey, Steeler fans and Seattle fans. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I have no idea.  He didn't know it was the Seahawks.  So he's like, but they quoted it differently in the paper today.  It was just like when we saw him at Giant Stadium when he was like, the Super Bowl will be the Giants and the Jets.  And the Jets were off to such a great start.  Well, he says that in every fucking city, depending on what team is in that area.  Ew, did he actually mention the team?  Oh, Mick, why?  But in all honesty, the guy's 62 years old, has unbelievable energy.  He's great on stage.  Fucking guy's ripped, which is, how does that happen at 62 years old? 
[00:36:00]  All he should do is point and go, I fucked 17-year-olds, and then skip around the stage like an older gentleman.  It was a cool stage.  The stage looked cool.  It was a cool stage, but very safe songs.  But that's obvious.  That's obvious.  They're not going to let him play Sympathy for the Devil or anything.  Start Me Up was annoying, though.  It's just like, come on, man.  You guys got so many good songs.  How about something?  They got to be safe.  And they got to bring everyone into the performance.  And they didn't even, they were even safe with Start Me Up, because they said, you make a dead man. 
[00:36:30]  Instead of dead man cum.  And they just left it, blank.  Was there a dead man cum in there?  Yeah.  There isn't.  It wasn't Oh No, Not You Again.  It was Oh No, No, No, No.  Rough Justice.  Yeah, would you like the new song?  Rough Justice?  Let's go to Bob the Trucker.  What is it?  Hey, guys.  Rough Justice new?  Hold on, Bob.  The new album's pretty good.  I'm not saying it's not.  I've heard the one song.  But if you're the Stones, you know, whatever.  But do they have, I mean, they're going to use it for sales.  If you want to keep putting albums out, that's fine. 
[00:37:00]  But you've got a catalog of hundreds of songs that people want to hear.  Just fucking play the hits.  Play the hits.  Play the hits from the past.  I don't want to hear a brand new Rolling Stones song during the halftime show.  No.  That was probably part of their contract.  We'll do it, but you have to let us.  That is totally what the deal was.  Of course that is.  And then in all the spots, the whole season was the new songs in all the spots.  That was part of the deal.  It was totally part of the deal.  They've probably made more money in endorsements than they did during live shows.  Yeah, of course.  Unbelievable.  Every time you saw them, it was them up on a TV screen doing it with the people in the commercial watching them. 
[00:37:30]  Bob.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, man.  I love your show.  I mean, you guys keep me up nice, man.  I have, like, two channels on my radio.  Oh, my God.  We don't care.  What do you got for the show, Bob?  Hey, they sounded like a bad garage band.  Jagger was great.  But Ron Wood, I don't know what fucking planet he was on.  They ended the song by satisfaction. 
[00:38:00]  It's like, you know, the drummer tried to end it, and Ron Wood was still playing.  And, I mean, you know, for being together for 40 years, this guy, they should know what he was thinking.  Holy shit.  I like the way they hide the fucking, the black, was he the bassist?  Daryl Jones.  They throw him off.  You never see him.  They just keep him.  It's almost like he married into the family, and they're embarrassed.  They're like, all right, just stick him on the side of the stage.  There's a line, a perforated line on the stage you can't cross.  You are not a rolling stone. 
[00:38:30]  Remember that.  Yes.  A rolling stone gathers no moss, but guess what it did pick up along the way?  Nathaniel had a great line.  Something like, they made him stay in one of the teeth or whatever, in a tooth.  He was only allowed in one tooth area of the stage.  You stay in this tooth.  All right.  Well, I mean, it was all right.  The halftime show, whatever.  It was a great game.  Seattle should be pissed at themselves, though.  They were awful.  They had, what was the time of possession in the first half? 
[00:39:00]  I mean, they played like shit.  They were terrible.  Had to be like 20 minutes.  It was.  They dominated the first half.  Yeah.  Showed up like a bunch of girls.  Less than that, gentlemen.  I want to know how the shindig was at your house.  The shindig was all right.  Who showed?  We had Travis, Nathaniel, Danny the alcoholic, and E-Rock bringing his own chicken wings  in a cooler and his own beer.  Did he share?  Yeah, he shared.  Sure did.  He went in the kitchen and was like Mr. Mom all of a sudden, just cooking up wings and 
[00:39:30]  I heard he got completely hammered and then drove back to Brooklyn.  No, E-Rock didn't get hammered.  I swear to God.  I heard.  No, I swear to God.  No?  He was barely drinking, actually.  If you want to talk to an alcoholic, it's Danny.  We were counting his beers.  Holy shit.  How many did he have?  Thirteen.  Thirteen beers.  Oh my God.  Dude, he wasn't there all day either.  What a drunken sot.  Thirteen beers in four hours, maybe.  Not even four hours.  Wow, that's really, really drinking. 
[00:40:00]  He was just...  Guinness, too, bro.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  He was pissed off because I got him a 12-pack of Guinness and someone drank one of them.  He had 11 Guinness.  You had 11 Guinnesses, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at him, man.  He's fucking...  He's functioning.  I'm a champion.  Were you annoyed that someone had one of your Guinnesses?  Uh, yeah.  Who had it?  Eric.  Eric grabbed one of your Guinnesses.  Yeah, and he's about halfway done with it.  And you know the bottles of Guinness, how they have that little floating widget inside? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  He starts shaking the bottle around.  He goes...  He looks at me, he goes,  All right, what'd you put in my beer?  Oh, no.  He did say that.  You ass.  That's a good one.  Why waste it on you if you don't even know what the widget is?  You don't know what the widget's all about?  You could be a Guinness fan.  Grab a Meister brow.  Yeah.  This is coming from the same dude who at the Ron and Fez party asked for a glass of red wine. 
[00:41:00]  And then when it came, he said,  Ooh, it's warm.  Connoisseur over there.  But he showed up with a huge cooler and a case of beer and...  Wings.  Wings that he cooked up.  Yeah, what a guy.  I really wanted to knock those wings on the floor.  I wanted to make a band.  I was like, dude, if you didn't have rugs,  I wanted to...  Because he was making a big thing of wings.  I just wanted to hit the end of the thing and watch them all tumble on the floor.  And this is how twisted I really am because I'm in my own place.  And Jimmy's like, oh my God, when he walks out with that tray of wings, 
[00:41:30]  we should just knock it over, knock it into him, something.  Just kick it out of his hand.  He would lose his mouth.  Just smack it and watch all those wings.  But I'm looking around my...  I'm looking around the room thinking where we could do this  because I'm like, we have to do this now.  We didn't.  We copped out.  Well, he didn't bring any out.  And he also, you know...  Then whatever.  I can't do that to Eric.  What?  I don't like Eric.  That's being nice, you know.  He brought food.  Was it the only food there?  No, there was food there. 
[00:42:00]  I ate so...  I hadn't eaten all day because I was looking for a light downtown.  I just forgot to eat.  I ate so much, I gave myself a stomach ache.  Really?  I had to get a little tummy ache.  I had to get a tum.  And then he fell asleep on the couch.  We got pictures of you asleep on the couch by the day.  Like a fucking bloated whale just laying there.  I was thinking afterwards, if I smelled Tostitos, I would have threw up.  Yeah.  I ate so much, so fast.  And he has the...  It was actually a decent spread, but the little tables, there was no way to hold your stuff. 
[00:42:30]  It's a New York apartment, though, man.  Seriously.  How many tables?  You know, it was tough just to get everyone a seat in that room.  I got photos.  I had a struggle.  I got some photos.  Yeah, Jimmy's got some photos.  We'll throw it up on the website.  Nice.  Yeah, the lonely bowl of fruit in the corner.  We reserved my old, rickety, awful computer chair for E-Rock.  Oh, you had to bring out the computer chair.  He had his name on it and everything.  So, that was a good time, though, right?  Yeah, it was enjoyable.  I'm looking at House Spear, House Sparks.  Is that him? 
[00:43:00]  House Sparks.  Right, right.  Yuck.  Yuck.  All right.  Yeah, it was a good time.  We were not like him.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Are we taping this?  Because they're doing a critique of all the Super Bowl ads on Good Morning America.  They're all doing it.  What about the Brown and Bubbly with Jay Moore?  That campaign died before it even began.  They wanted to start this whole thing, Brown and Bubbly.  Terrible.  For Diet Pepsi, I guess.  And then the website, brownandbubbly.com. 
[00:43:30]  It's awful.  What is Brown and Bubbly?  What is it supposed to mean?  Diet Pepsi.  It's brown and it's bubbly.  It's bubbly.  If they want to bring it into the rap community, they should have Diet Pepsi, shoot, Diet Coke.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah, our old pal Jay Moore was doing the Diet Pepsi, Brown and Bubbly ads.  Kind of good for Jay.  He's in a Super Bowl commercial.  He acted.  The acting was fine.  It wasn't him.  It was just the concept of the commercial I didn't like. 
[00:44:00]  It was nothing to do with him.  It was just whoever wrote it.  Yeah, he did great, but it was just like, what?  What are they doing with this thing?  Like the Jackie Chan one where they brought in the stunt soda?  No.  Diet Coke.  And it was, you know.  Diet Coke.  Diet Coke.  And he got killed, I guess.  Yeah.  The Magic Fridge thing.  That was a good commercial.  That was all right.  I don't even remember any of the other commercials.  Nothing else stands out.  The Whopper commercial was okay.  What did it mean, though?  Nothing.  A bunch of chicks being thrown at each other.  Old Fabio.  He had a little sense of humor about himself. 
[00:44:30]  But the current Fabio, they could have just used that.  They didn't have to make him look old.  He was already old.  If they want a memorable commercial, just superimpose whatever you're selling in the bottom right-hand corner of the video of him taking a bird to the face on that roller coaster.  Because that was the funniest, most memorable Fabio moment ever.  Ever.  Yeah.  They were opening up some roller coaster at some park, and they had celebrity Fabio in the front car of the thing.  And the roller coaster goes around. 
[00:45:00]  This is a few years back.  And when it pulls in, there's a dazed Fabio in the front seat, profusely bleeding from the face.  With a broken nose.  Yeah.  He hit a sucks-to-be-you or an unlucky lottery, whatever that is.  And a bird was flying when the roller coaster went by and smacked him right in the face.  Great stuff.  Please tell me you have the fucking, the warm Budweiser Clydesdale commercial?  Well, yeah, I said, throw your head back, stupid. 
[00:45:30]  We'll have it in a second.  We'll have it in a second.  They're critiquing on Good Morning America.  We'll give them a little-  Yeah, that hell's a real trip.  We'll give them a little push today.  We'll play some of their audio.  But, yeah, the Clydesdale, whatever.  They got the young horse getting ready to pull the big Budweiser carriage or whatever you want to call it.  Yeah.  The horse walks in, right, and he kind of puts himself in that, what was that?  That stupid harness?  The harness, yeah.  He had a noose, and he was just going to jerk off and hang himself.  I don't think horses practice that. 
[00:46:00]  Auto-erotic asphyxiation.  Oh, my God.  This was the greatest Super Bowl commercial ever.  The little girls saying what's wrong with them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm afraid she's fat.  You could lose a few pounds.  That's right.  I thought this was a commercial.  It was pro-choice.  If your children are this ugly and unimportant.  Should be aborted.  You know what?  I think they copped out, to tell you the truth, because the kids were all right.  I've walked around and seen a lot uglier children they could have used for that commercial. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  It would have turned them off.  It would have turned off people if they used truly heinous, ugly kids.  But they were like average children.  Right.  Should have picked out some real ugly kids.  Some real messes?  Yeah, some real messes.  Of course.  Show that.  Give me a few cleft palates.  That's going to be good.  You've got to wash with the Dove soap and watch you don't get it in your nostril up that  little trough.  Horses are eating out of your face.  Old hay storage face. 
[00:47:00]  They're talking about the strangest commercial right now on TV.  The two monsters.  That stunk.  It was supposed to be Godzilla, but obviously they couldn't get the rights to use Godzilla  in the commercials, so they had some monster that was sort of Godzilla-ish and a robot  giving birth to a car.  Did you see that one?  No, I missed that one, too.  You gave up on the Super Bowl, my friend.  No, no.  I was watching.  There were a couple of times I had my head turned.  I was rotoscoping Jimmy out of a scene from Colin's show there to use in a future funny 
[00:47:30]  little video clip.  Wait, which one?  It's just you talking, you sitting and talking, waving your arms.  I think I'm going to put you in the backseat of some car from Silence of the Lambs.  Let's go to Cody in Illinois.  Cody.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Pretty good game yesterday.  I've got to say, my favorite commercial is the bear.  You know, when the guy goes up and puts his beer on the rock, and his buddy comes by and 
[00:48:00]  fucking snakes it and runs through the woods.  Woo-hoo!  Yeah, Steve was in a lot of commercials yesterday.  There were a lot of bear commercials.  I thought it was Jimmy.  You know, he's running through the woods because he didn't want to get butt-fucked by the big  grizzly.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  That's a clip from one of the commercials.  Grr.  I'm pushing out, guys.  All right.  Now we've got people just calling in with their favorite Super Bowl commercials.  This should kill two minutes.  Mark, the trucker, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  I definitely got to say my favorite commercial is that right by the beginning with FedEx Caveman 
[00:48:30]  where he's tying the note to a pterodactyl and then he come out of the cave and he  kicked a little dinosaur and then got stomped on.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, that was awesome.  But, of course, he kicks the dinosaur and then gets killed because the bully has to  get it in the end.  Right.  Super Bowl was great, guys.  That was a great bit, man.  Love you guys.  Punch it out.  Did you enjoy the big game?  Did you?  It was, I don't know.  I could care less about either team, so.  I mean, I'm sure they're just losing their minds in Pittsburgh this morning, but it was 
[00:49:00]  just one of those.  It was two teams I could care less about.  Just bad mustaches.  I saw a few things burning.  Huh?  I saw a few things burning on the news.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  It looked like it wasn't some real incredibly bad rioting after a victory.  So all they kind of showed was it looked like an awning was ripped down off of some kind  of pizza place or eye care place or something, and they just set that on fire on the street.  Yeah.  That was the only burning thing I saw.  There was a moment during the Super Bowl or Super Bowl coverage in general that was 
[00:49:30]  beyond funny.  What was the moment?  You're going to have to think.  Let me think.  Jimmy didn't see it, but I had to tell him about it.  Do we have that audio, by the way?  Did we tape that?  You think?  Let me think.  No, it's easy.  See, I'll pick this out out of 15 hours of programming that day.  No, this thing was the funniest thing ever.  Funnier than any of the freaking commercials.  Aye. 
[00:50:00]  Buy me.  We'll just keep it open-ended for now.  See if someone gets it.  But wait, wait.  Open.  Hmm.  I think.  I want to know.  Chris in Florida, what's up?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, man.  What about that AmeriQuest commercial when they were on the airplane and that lady was  trying to sneak by that dude and hit that pocket, the turbulence, and she ended up in his lap  with her shirt undone, and then the little kids were looking at him?  I thought it was freaking hilarious.  You know, it was okay, the AmeriQuest guy.  Yeah, don't judge too quickly.  I thought that was awesome, too.  It would have been funnier if they had a father, like a black boss, comes home with his, he gives 
[00:50:30]  his white female employee a ride home because her car broke down.  Yeah.  But then the father opens the door and sees the black guy there with his daughter and  goes and grabs the shotgun on there because AmeriQuest, don't judge too quickly.  Can you imagine if they threw a person like that on TV?  No one has balls anymore, man.  Too offensive.  Can you imagine if you just said, ah, fuck it, got it past everybody? 
[00:51:00]  Too offensive.  Everybody would be talking about your fine company today.  Yep.  Everybody.  Instead, we're like racking our brains trying to remember the commercials, you know?  Yeah, this is what we got now because of all the crackdown.  Yeah, thank you.  Thank you for protecting us.  My favorite Super Bowl commercial was the terrific commercial for the shaggy dog that's  coming out with Tim Allen.  That was just hilarious.  That was just terrific.  Doesn't that movie look like a hit?  Oh my God.  But he's like a dog, but he's not.  He like barks and stuff. 
[00:51:30]  Another remake.  It's terrific, though.  He's running around and acting like a dog, knocking old people over and messing up the  buffet.  It's just great.  Yeah.  Ugh.  We didn't see any Pink Panther promos.  Ugh.  Damn it.  What's happening?  What's happening to people?  Somebody wants to guess the funniest moment in the Super Bowl coverage.  Okay.  I wanted this to go on for like four hours.  I'm thinking it's not something obvious like one of the commercials or something. 
[00:52:00]  It's got to be one of these little obscure moments, right?  Well, it wasn't obscure for the gang that was at my house yesterday because we all openly  mocked and laughed at it.  And then I realized that I have some really, really awful friends.  Then it must have been trying to be sensitive.  Rick in New York.  Retards.  Retards playing football.  Holy shit.  Stop.  That was fucking awesome.  Holy shit.  Do we have the piece? 
[00:52:30]  Holy crap.  Do we?  They were playing tag football.  And they have this one slow person.  Let's be politically correct.  One slow person.  I don't think that's politically correct, Ovi.  I don't give a shit.  Calling them slow people.  Well, she was slow on the football field.  Okay.  All right.  She had the ball and she's awkwardly running toward the fucking goal.  The goal line.  And then you got this lumbering slow person running like bat out of hell. 
[00:53:00]  Catches up to the slow girl and rips her tag off her body.  Uh-oh.  Or her flag.  I mean, her flag off her body.  I'm like, oh, that's good.  Good lesson to teach the slow people to rip clothes off each other.  You'll never make it.  They should show them playing it again when he goes to pull the white flag and it's a  tampon and he yanks it out and she falls down, bleeding, confused, cries and thinks she's 
[00:53:30]  been shot.  Waving it in the air.  I win.  I win.  No.  They had the emotional music and everything and I'm sitting there like, please don't  do this.  They should play Benny Hill music.  Please don't do this.  Please don't do this.  And then we all kind of looked at each other and realized it was safe to laugh and we laughed  and laughed and laughed.  No retards in the room, really.  Technically.  Yeah.  Let's go to Nick in Canada.  Nick.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey. 
[00:54:00]  I was just calling in.  Oh, fuck.  I'm punching out.  Wow.  You're doing good.  No, that was pretty good, though.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What do you got?  I was just calling in because advertising here in Canada, or not Canada, in North America  is fucking lame compared to the UK.  I downloaded some shows from there.  If we had ads like that here, fuck, I'd watch ads instead of TV.  Wow.  That was even worse than I thought it would be.  I couldn't believe that we actually got you to stay on and go through with that awful  call, but boy, was that bad. 
[00:54:30]  He had the handle.  He had his hands on the handle between his legs.  He was ready to pull, save his own life.  $2 billion jet goes down in flames, but he stayed with it right to the end.  That's right.  Good job, Paul Meacham.  He's like Santini.  I'm going to go draft me.  The great Santini.  Good calls, punch fans.  Wrote it in.  You saved so many people on the ground.  All right.  Thank you, Nick.  Wow.  Let's go to Abe in Baltimore.  Abe.  Yo.  Dave is on, buddy.  Stop listening to the show. 
[00:55:00]  Listen to the phone, you motherfucker.  You guys, if you're going to...  Whatever.  Where's Abe?  Do whatever the fuck you want.  I don't give a shit.  Do you hang up on Abe?  No, he's still there.  Abe.  He's listening to the radio.  Instead of talking, he's live on the fucking show.  Now he hangs up.  Abe is an ass.  Dude, if you...  Abe.  You guys, if you call the show, we're on a slight delay.  Just turn down your radio.  What do you tell girls your name is when you're trying to pick one up and your name is Abe?  You don't say Abe.  You just hope they misunderstood you and think you said AIDS. 
[00:55:30]  Do you want to hear the audio of...  It's a little nicer.  It's easier for the palate.  Yeah.  Do you want to hear the audio of the retards playing football?  Absolutely.  I'm sure they sound dumber than those Clydesdales.  It was a very emotional piece.  This is the type of thing you now get during Super Bowl coverage.  Let's be kind.  On an autumn morning in New York's Hudson Valley, Tommy Hines starts his Saturday by lining this field  and thinking about the joy it will soon bring. 
[00:56:00]  The kids and their smiles on their faces and everything.  They never go away, those smiles.  What is he talking about?  The one salad bowl they pass around for their haircuts.  Oh, my.  Your daddy died.  Big smile.  It doesn't matter what you tell these things.  Pop.  These things.  Always smiling.  You don't get it. 
[00:56:30]  But the music, man.  The music.  The music's there to make you cry.  Trying to get a play off the defensive ends or eating bark.  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny.  Yeah, see, that's what we're doing right now.  Well, we'd better start the dramatic music again.  Yeah, let me hear the music.  I didn't mean to mock that.  I apologize.  I didn't either. 
[00:57:00]  Tell you that.  My apologies.  Well, let's try to get through this.  All right.  I apologize.  On an autumn morning in New York's Hudson Valley, Tommy Hines starts his Saturday by lining  this field and thinking about the joy it will soon bring.  What does he line it with?  The kids.  What does he line it with?  It's like a wee-wee pad like you would for a bunch of puppies in a kitchen.  I'm trying to play the piece.  I'm starting over again. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, shit.  On an autumn morning in New York's Hudson Valley, Tommy Hines starts his Saturday by lining this  field and thinking about the joy it will soon bring.  The kids and their smiles on their faces and everything.  I mean, it's, I can't get that out of my head.  And it makes every minute of what I do worthwhile. 
[00:58:00]  For Tommy knows that hours from now.  For Tommy knows.  For Tommy knows.  It's going to be all artistic.  Like he said, their smiles makes it all worthwhile what I do.  What kind of job does he have?  Does he give experimental drugs to pregnant women?  Another success.  I run a bar for pregnant women, but I just serve them alcohol.  Unless he's lining the field with a firing squad.  I don't want to hear the rest of this. 
[00:58:30]  I'd love to get them to play tag football.  You tie a yellow thing to the front of a bueller.  Go ahead, go grab that.  They would.  It's because someone they trust told them.  From now, his work and this field will help make the most improbable of football dreams come true. 
[00:59:00]  These are the devils of East Greenbush, New York.  They are all pioneers.  For this is the nation's first and only Pop Warner Challenger Football League.  I thought the Jets were.  Challenger Football League.  Wow.  Appropriate.  To name them after.  Another disaster.  Another what could have been.  Shattered dreams. 
[00:59:30]  Crying parents.  A nation shocked and revulsed.  They're playing the endeavors.  When we first come up with it, we had people look at us like we were nuts. 
[01:00:00]  I'm retarded.  You want my kid on the field, but in a wheelchair, playing football.  That's what happens in this Challenger League, where young athletes with disabilities are brought to this field.  And often aided by a parent, they catch the ball, carry the ball, and cross the goal.  All the defensive line needs is broom handles.  Right in the spokes.  They catch the ball, run with the ball, and cross the goal line. 
[01:00:30]  Then shit their pants and get confused.  Been running in a circle at age 30.  Oh, that's horrible.  No one loses.  No one even keeps score.  And while they do play defense, no contact flag football rules. 
[01:01:00]  Let mid-20s men share the field safely with pre-teen girls.  All right.  Hold on.  Retarded justice.  Penalty boner on the field.  15 yards. 
[01:01:30]  You cannot get these people worked up.  Let mid-20s men share the field safely with pre-teen girls.  Like Kenzie Edwards, an 8-year-old with Down syndrome, who loves to imitate her favorite player, the Giants' Jeremy Shocker.  When you score a touchdown, what do you do with the ball?  Um, I got a football player before.  What? 
[01:02:00]  Um, I don't know.  What'd she say?  She said, I've had a...  Let's say hi to Bill in Michigan.  Bill!  Yeah.  Hey, Bill.  What's happening?  What's up?  I was just wondering what Bob Kelly's reaction was during this commercial.  Oh, my God.  He lost five...  He's got a commercial, sir.  He lost five pounds of water weight.  I bet so.  No, he didn't.  He scored 21 points. 
[01:02:30]  I heard a knee, man.  I heard a knee, man.  I was playing to a slip ball, and a retard thought jelly was on me, so he tackled me, and I didn't lick my hand.  Oh, my chromosomes.  Nelson in Jersey.  Nelson!  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  What's up?  That's part of that whole fucking thing was when they threw the ball to the one kid, and  they're talking about the parents helping him out.  They handed the ball to the kid in the wheelchair, and he fucking drops it on the ground.  And the parents have to run and, like, pick it up and give it back to him so he can score 
[01:03:00]  the touchdown.  Oh, the parents can run out on the field and help?  Yeah.  Is this really a game?  Oh, they're pushing?  No, the parents do everything.  Parents push the wheelchairs, catch the pass, give it to their thing, and then they push  the wheelchair forward.  Oh, that's just...  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike, what's up?  Yeah, I was watching that special story, and it seems like the best part for these kids  is the parents get to change them from hockey helmets into football helmets. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, jeez.  Chad in California.  Chad.  Hey, I know what the little girl said.  She said, three rights, make a left.  I want to go home.  Three lefts.  Wait, three right.  Yeah, that was right.  All right, Chad.  Thank you.  There you go.  Let's go to Jim in Florida.  Jim, what's up?  Yeah, I'm wondering, what's a cheerleading squad like?  A bunch of girls with Down Syndrome going, blah, blah, blah.  No.  Had kind of a good premise to it.  Oh, shit.  I like the premise of the retarded cheerleader, but... 
[01:04:00]  I think we might have a little more audio here.  Well, they try to get, like, the taunts going, the cheerleading taunts.  It's like, you know, one, two, three, four, but they get to the one, and then they just  get stuck.  One.  Ah.  Did you write this down?  Ah.  Let's see if there's more audio.  I'm at a loss.  From new end zone dances...  Woo!  ...to the old hidden ball trick, these Pop Warner athletes get to do every... 
[01:04:30]  Where do you hide the ball behind your tongue?  ...to the old hidden ball trick.  Give me an R.  Give me an L.  Give me an X.  Give me a shoe.  What is that spell?  I don't know.  We got spirit.  Yes, we do.  We got spirit.  I think I made two.  One, two, three, four. 
[01:05:00]  We're still going to get beat up at school.  Jesus.  This is so wrong.  Here we go in our pants.  Here we go.  B, retarded.  B, E, retarded.  B, retarded. 
[01:05:30]  Let's go to Chad in Florida.  Hey, Chad, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I was just wondering, do they allow electric wheelchairs?  And if they did or did not, would that be considered performance enhancing?  He didn't even want to get his phone call critiqued.  Click?  That's not fair.  You've got to sit there and get critiqued after your call.  Take the pain.  These Pop Warner athletes get to do everything they've seen other kids do. 
[01:06:00]  Athletes like 16-year-old Alyssa Hines, who has cerebral palsy and has known the pain of being treated as different.  I don't think you can make this feel so bad.  It makes me feel like I can actually come out there and do something. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  And have a life just like everybody else.  Slow down.  They are all lives that deserve these moments of joy, no matter how fleeting.  Eight years ago, Jake Powell suffered a brain seizure and collapsed in front of his parents.  Month after month of doctors and tests.  Jesus.  Wait a minute.  I just want to watch a fucking football game.  Let's hear his quote. 
[01:07:00]  I bring nothing to the table.  Wow.  He did suffer some damage.  These bastards.  I just want to watch the Super Bowl.  And then they enhance it.  You know, because I'm sure we're going to get killed on this one.  And then they're enhancing the story with the most dramatic, sad music they could possibly find from their music library.  It's the cancer piano music.  Oh, crap.  Michael in Arizona.  Michael.  How are you guys today?  Hey.  Good.  Hey, you know what?  I've been listening to you guys for a few months, and today is the only thing I have a problem with. 
[01:07:30]  I just don't think that it's very cool.  I hope that you guys poke fun at these folks here.  It's not.  No.  You're right.  It's not.  It's beautiful.  But we know no other way.  I don't think it's very cool that they threw this piece on TV yesterday.  Yeah, it's kind of to exploit them, don't you think?  It's supposed to be a very festive Sunday for everybody.  You invite your friends and family over, and it's all about happiness.  You're forgetting about work and your stupid lives for one fucking day, and they throw this at you.  Absolutely.  What's wrong with that?  These kids are happy. 
[01:08:00]  What if this is the only thing that they ever make them happy the entire year is just one football game?  But does it have to happen on Super Bowl Sunday?  Can't they be happy some other day on a Sunday, maybe?  How about July 8th?  Let them be happy.  They only get one day of happiness.  Can we at least space it out?  I think it's just because Jimmy is upset because they get more TV time than he does.  That is actually true, and they would probably, uh...  Yeah, gotta give them that.  If they wanted to give these people, you know, a day in the spotlight, they should have chose,  uh, I don't know, the spot right after Emily Rose. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Right?  That's really funny, actually.  Thank you.  See, because Emily Rose only had one episode before they yanked the series.  Right.  The ratings were really, really bad, so to follow that would be really awful.  No one would be watching.  I know.  Bad leading, yeah.  But I didn't think I had to explain the entire joke.  I hate...  Listeners that have to bring everything down to reality.  I know, man.  We were just having fun.  But then he tried to, like...  This stuff makes us feel better about ourselves.  Absolutely.  We don't know them. 
[01:09:00]  It's funny because we don't know them.  If we did, it would be horrible.  No, it wouldn't.  It would still be a hoot.  Cures and tests revealed that he had a rare form of cancer.  Oh.  That means that there's no cure.  There never has been.  They can prolong life as much as possible, but they can't cure it.  He the quarterback?  He now knows that he will die.  And he's okay.  I just want to watch the game!  You don't want to be sitting here watching a child slowly go. 
[01:09:30]  What?  All right.  Why did they do this?  Listen, we're making jokes on it all, but this is a question.  What's the purpose of this?  What is the point?  Someone explain to me the purpose of this.  Seriously.  Do you understand every human being on this fucking planet has issues and problems and  things we have to deal with on a daily basis?  And I don't want to sit there and get depressed and fucking deal with other people's bullshit  like this?  Especially on Super Bowl Sunday.  Yeah.  When you sit down for Super Bowl... 
[01:10:00]  No, I'm serious, though.  Super Bowl Sunday, you're like, wow, this is a really fun, festive day with your friends  and family.  Why are they throwing this at you?  This is worse than any Janet Jackson tit.  Absolutely.  Right here.  Worse.  Worse than any Janet Jackson tit.  Leaves me feeling more depressed and fucking angry than Janet Jackson tit.  And what's the purpose?  What is the purpose?  What are they selling here?  To have...  What are they selling?  RD-40.  To have all of America feel sorry for this person, and then what? 
[01:10:30]  Acme hangers.  And then what?  Is there a number so we can donate to something that we can't cure?  What is it?  So how does it end?  Jesus.  Please tell me it ends soon.  Yeah.  It's easy to make fun, but seriously, what is the purpose of this?  What is the purpose?  As far as I'm concerned, it's so we can do this.  Yeah.  A child's soul.  No.  But he's happy as long as we keep him happy. 
[01:11:00]  Jake has missed most of this season's games.  So the members of Jake's family do everything they can to get Jake onto the football field one more time for the last game of the season.  Go! Go! Get on the...  Here, go! Go!  Don't play the football.  In the first game, Jake is racing toward the end zone.  When the ball slips from his grasp.  And Jake loses his chance to score. 
[01:11:30]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  It happens to the pros.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Happens to the pros.  That's right.  Come on.  And why did they have to keep that in the piece?  Yeah.  I like the fact they kept that in the piece.  I know, but they had the feel-good part where the kid finally gets to play.  Let him score.  They could show him on the field going, and his dream came true.  He got on the field one last time.  End of story.  Thank you very much.  Get to Aaron Neville butchering the fucking national anthem.  I guess it's fucking... 
[01:12:00]  It's tough to catch a football with a brick on your pituitary gland.  They had to add the part where the guy drops the fucking ball as he's trying to score.  Oh.  But we're the bastards today.  Then, before halftime, Jake must be taken off the field.  Aw.  He couldn't finish up.  He had a seizure, and so he had to be changed.  And he's like, I'm sorry. 
[01:12:30]  And I'm like...  It wasn't a seizure.  It was his end zone dance.  Oh, my God.  He got a little confused.  Oh.  He said, I'm sorry.  That's really depressing.  Yeah.  He's like, I'm sorry.  And I'm like, this is nothing to do.  You did not do this.  It's not anything you can help, so do not worry about it.  But even as his body betrays him, Jake has a spirit that stays strong.  He returns to the field.  And now, when it comes time for Jake to score a touchdown, 
[01:13:00]  it is a gift of love from father to son.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Right.  The movie music kicks in.  Everybody wants that moment.  Dip his hands in molasses.  Everybody wants to be a star.  Don't drop it, Stuart.  That's what the challenge is all about.  Don't embarrass me again.  Given every child, regardless of who you are, that opportunity to feel that important. 
[01:13:30]  Don't not cover the spread of the world.  I get 1,500 on this game.  How old was Jake?  I didn't see it.  Thank God.  How could you tell?  I didn't see that.  It could have been 4 or 30.  I don't know.  Oh, is that depressing?  Yes.  And we wanted to have a little fun with it, but obviously that is a horrific story.  It just got worse and worse.  What was the point?  Someone explain to me what the point was. 
[01:14:00]  That's okay, but we're not allowed to see Janet Jackson's left tit.  And this is where he came out and boom, crapped his pants.  Horrid.  See, this is the 5-4 defense.  This is when the running back goes to the left.  All the defensive ends just roll on the ground and hold sodas.  Let's go to Flop Dick in Cleveland.  Flop Dick.  Good morning, boys.  What's going on?  Hey, Flop Dick. 
[01:14:30]  There was another funny part I noticed on there.  One of the fathers of the retarded, he holds his retarded daughter on his knee.  He's kind of shaking her and he says, honey, you like doing the end zone dance, don't you?  And he sits back chuckling and her retarded face doesn't move a bit.  Punching out.  Let's go to Beck in Florida.  I know.  That was harsh.  Beck, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  You know, we're sitting here with our buddies, drinking, watching the game, making fun of  the retards.  And all of our girlfriends get pissed off at us. 
[01:15:00]  We're in the fucking day.  We get the silent treatment during the whole fucking game and it ruined the whole football.  Yeah, that's pretty much a...  All they care about is the retards.  We're out trying to have a good time.  That was a piece for women.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Oh, they were to bring the women in.  They were just crying their eyes out yesterday watching that.  You didn't see the old football games.  They didn't do that.  Let's parade out the thalidomide babies to see if they can catch a football with flipper hands.  Here comes little Mark.  He has polio. 
[01:15:30]  We sure hope a cure comes in for this soon.  And remember, smoke luckies.  Oh, that's just awful.  Now we're all depressed.  We're going to have to break and regroup.  I was holding it together until he apologized for shitting his own pants.  Yeah.  He had a seizure and had to be changed.  I mean, why though?  Seriously.  And then they used the dramatic music to really...  They didn't need music on that piece.  Trust me. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, that would have worked.  That would have worked well.  All right, we'll go to break with this.  We'll continue with the Open Anthony program.  We've got to talk about Aaron Neville butchering the Star Spangled Banner.  Another sad moment.  Because they were trying to find an artist from New Orleans.  Yeah.  That's all they have down there.  Well, the rest of them drown, I think.  Jesus.  All sitting there in their little tin shacks with a wall of water poured in.  This is a hard show.  Who's another one that I heard recently?  Oh, uh...  Blueberry Hill guy was from there. 
[01:16:30]  No, he was all right, but what's his name?  He was homeless.  Yeah.  And they found him.  I can't remember his name.  From some 70s rock band, was it?  Yeah.  We'll get the answer during the break.  Yeah, some of them.  All right, we go to break with this today.  All right, let's get back into this mess.  We call the Opie and Anthony program.  It's Ian on Long Island.  Ian, what's up, buddy?  What's going on? 
[01:17:00]  What's up, Buzzy?  Hi.  I believe you're looking for Fats Domino.  Yes.  Fats Domino was the singer who was all washed up and they couldn't find him for days.  And when they found him...  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, we know about him.  We know about Fats Domino and they found him and he was alive and all that and he lost everything  pretty much from Katrina.  But there was another singer or guitars from, I think, some 70s rock band that turned out  to be homeless or something and they found him dead.  Oh, well, I guess I just sucked, Ben.  That's all right, Ian.  Thanks. 
[01:17:30]  Let's go to Roy in Ohio.  Roy?  Hi.  Hi.  Yeah, it was Barry Cowstil from the group The Cowstil in the 60s.  All right.  That's the guy.  He found that on a pier.  What was their song?  The Rain, the Park, and Other Things, and Hair.  That's about it.  You know, most people know that I've been doing radio my entire life.  I couldn't tell you one Cowstil song.  This one.  And Hair.  What's it called, though? 
[01:18:00]  I have no idea.  That's called The Rain, the Park, and Other Things.  But they did Hair.  That was like their big hit.  The Cowstil.  Yeah, that's great.  But what's the name of this song that we're playing?  The Way That She Loves Me?  No, The Rain, the Park, and Other Things.  I want to hear the Hair song.  The Hair song?  I never heard it.  I don't want to hear any of this.  What?  What's this?  This is Hair.  Hair.  Is it?  She asked him why. 
[01:18:30]  It's like 1960-something.  It's awful.  The Harchard family was based on that.  I'm a hairy guy.  You don't remember this, Jim?  No.  From the play Hair?  No.  I never saw that.  It'll be on your iPod later today, though.  Yours is.  There you go.  I never saw that.  The Cowstils stink.  Cowstils.  What were they called?  The Cow Sills.  Oh.  I always called them the Cowstils.  That was the Cowstils. 
[01:19:00]  All right.  Thank you, Roy.  All right.  No problem.  Can you turn off the Cow Sills?  I don't know.  It's not bad.  It's not bad.  Who cares?  But what happens?  We don't want to go to the hook.  But what happens in the hair song, Hope?  Nothing.  He has long hair.  They go, give me a head with hair.  Long, beautiful hair.  Because it's shiny.  You never heard that one?  Wait.  How do you know that song?  Ew.  From the play.  What play?  Hair.  Oh, that was in the play Hair?  Yeah.  You know, all that music had its time and place, I guess. 
[01:19:30]  When?  The Age of Aquarius.  That's a good song.  All right.  Let's go to RJ in North Carolina.  RJ.  Thanks.  Hey, Jimmy.  I'd like to know, what is RD-40?  Is that like spray abortion and spray lubricant?  I must have fucked up.  Because there's one that was, what is RD-40?  There was one that was like.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  I never want to correct you, Jimmy.  You're my hero.  No, no.  Please.  You should have corrected me.  I was wrong.  But I was a spur of the moment improv. 
[01:20:00]  I knew I didn't know it.  What's the morning after pill?  R2D2?  RD-46, right?  All 46.  All right.  So I was up by six.  That wasn't bad.  WD-40?  Oh, yeah.  I fucked up.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, RJ.  Let's say hi to Martin.  He's from Cleveland.  Martin.  Yes.  What's up?  I want to come down for American Mass.  You're the comedian?  Yeah.  Your boy, who called for you earlier? 
[01:20:30]  Bill Squire.  Yeah.  And you're a mess?  Yeah.  I won the lottery and I spent all my money.  Now I'm not eligible for disability.  How much did you win in the lottery?  $50,000.  $50,000.  And you're a schizo?  Yeah.  I'm schizophrenic.  How did you find that out?  I kind of freaked out a couple times and got locked up.  Oh, yeah.  Didn't remember.  Do you have two different names?  Like, is your name whatever it is, and then you call yourself, like, Vic Ferrari? 
[01:21:00]  I go by Schizo Bill on stage.  Schizo Bill, you're a comedian, huh?  Yeah.  I'm doing the Cleveland Improv tonight.  He's plugging.  I know.  I love this guy.  Yeah, already.  That's the way to do it.  Why don't you give us a piece of your act?  Yeah.  Do a little, do you bring the schizo into your act?  Yeah.  That's always funny when handicapped people or people with problems bring it into their act.  Yes.  I like that.  Last time I had a girlfriend, I was in the mental hospital.  We never really broke up. 
[01:21:30]  We just each underwent shock treatments and forgot we were dating each other.  It's not bad.  It's not bad.  His delivery is a little, like, weird.  You choppy fool.  Yeah, you're all fast.  You don't say it.  Say it again.  Can you say other twice in the punchline?  You shouldn't say other twice.  Oh.  Last time I was, right.  Last time I had a girlfriend, I was in the mental hospital.  We never really broke up.  We just each underwent shock treatments and forgot we were dating each other.  We just something shock treatments?  We.  We each underwent shock treatment. 
[01:22:00]  We each underwent shock treatment.  And then forgot we were seeing each other.  How about forgot we were dating?  That's what I said.  Okay.  You're right.  I'm wrong.  That's what you said.  I heard it twice another way.  You wouldn't know.  Okay.  Good.  Do it that way.  What do I know?  I'll do it that way.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Keep saying the same thing twice.  You'll be leaving Cleveland soon for bigger things.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because we would each go for shock treatments and then forget we were seeing each other.  Okay.  It's a little.  Each time it happened.  You know what, dude?  You're right.  I mean, why obsess about the language when you're trying to make your living doing spoken word? 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Comedy needs to be wordy.  Yeah.  It's better.  It's better.  The more you can say and the more repeated words, the better it is for the audience.  Wordy equals big laughs.  Jesus.  I got books in near EPA.  Yeah.  How about this?  Do you ever hear this one?  Two Jews walking to a bar.  They own the bar.  See?  Yeah.  That's good.  Exactly.  All right.  Give us another joke there.  When I was in the mental hospital, I did therapy. 
[01:23:00]  I did art therapy, music therapy, and writing therapy.  In writing therapy, I learned to write poetry.  I write poetry to the woman I stalk.  I write things like love is a strange motion, yet I understand what I'm with you.  I seriously considered suicide until I met you, and my love for you is stronger than  any restraining order.  Here's what I like about your act so far.  Not only is it redundant, but it's unintelligible because you speak so quickly.  You're like a mumble mouth.  Yeah.  I write poetry when I like to write.  I like to write. 
[01:23:30]  You're about to cut me off or something.  Dude, you got to...  Stop being paranoid.  We're not going to cut you off.  This is your moment.  You have to cut down on repeating the same word over and over without reason.  Yeah.  Take that big wooden stick out of your mouth they use when they put that shock on your  head each time they do it, eachly.  Calm down.  I guess the record for shock treatment, they got like 72.  Yeah?  Where's the punchline?  It's not a punchline.  Oh, I see.  Oh, really?  All right.  Well, slow down.  Take a deep breath. 
[01:24:00]  We're not hanging up on you.  We want to just hear how well you do your material.  Let's hear one more joke.  Uh, I guess...  Shit dick.  Yeah, how you doing?  Shit dick!  What?  Oh.  I just want to say that the abortion pill is called RU486, and this guy's mother should  have used it.  Take care of it.  RU486.  Oh, wow.  Dude, I was way off.  RT40.  What a shit.  RT46.  RU486.  Dude, I was off by one letter and 446 numbers. 
[01:24:30]  I understood what we were trying to say.  I know, but I butchered it.  Uh, Cindy, what's up?  I just wanted to know if you guys saw the thing on CNBC about Howard petitioning the FCC  so he could stop people from putting his shows on MP3s.  He's getting his just desserts.  Oh, now he needs to see the FCC.  Easy with the tough terminology.  Dessert.  Oh.  Sorry.  Just desserts. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, there's pirate stations popping up, is what the problem is.  It's not so much the downloading, it's the pirate stations.  Arr!  Party arr!  For some reason, Brooklyn is like this hotbed of pirate radio, and they don't broadcast that  far.  It usually winds up interfering with someone else's signal, and that's how they get caught, because  somebody's trying to listen to, you know, Hot 97 or something, and they can't in Brooklyn,  and they get mad. 
[01:25:30]  So a couple of these stations started playing Howard's show from Sirius on their little pirate  station, Arr!  And how many people are really listening to those pirate stations for a minute?  A couple.  A couple.  A couple dozen.  How do they find out where you're getting it?  How do they find out where it's coming from?  Word of mouth, and then you kind of get the FCC involved, and they do some triangulation.  And they figure it out.  They figure out where the transmitter is.  How they can do that?  Yeah.  Down to the apartment?  Yeah. 
[01:26:00]  Howard doesn't want to give anything away for free.  Not one bloody cent.  Nothing for free.  Nothing for free if you're a fan of his show.  My logic on this whole thing, my take on it, and it's probably different from XMs because  they're the business end of this, is you're always going to get some residual theft of  services.  This happens in every industry.  I don't care if it's the guy in the office taking a few paperclips home, or the white-collar  criminal taking a few million home, is always going to be some inventory loss. 
[01:26:30]  And that's what happens.  Some people can pick up our show on different areas here and there.  Technology's out there.  The internet, they're able to grab it up.  It's going to be a loss.  The thing is, to do a good enough show and entertain people enough where they come on  board and subscribe.  Well, it gives them something to talk about for a few hours a day.  Yeah, let's go to BCH and-  Wait a minute, I'm sorry, are we taping this Pink Panther interview with Beyonce? 
[01:27:00]  I hope so.  Please tell me we're going to do it.  Because I want to know what she has to say.  We're obsessed with the Pink Panther.  You know what?  I bet you, I'll bet you any amount of-  Oh, that's Steve Marl.  He's trying to stop-  Oh, that's horrific.  He's trying to stop the water from coming out of the pipe.  Oh, is that funny?  Oh, come on, Steve.  Hurry, hurry.  She's coming.  She's coming.  Oh, now there's a fire.  Oh, fire.  What's he going to do?  The curtains are on fire. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, no.  And he's making wacky arm gestures.  Oh, I bet you the French accent is really awful right there.  Wow.  They come back from the clip laughing.  They come back to Beyonce Live with Diane Slayer.  She's laughing and laughing.  I want to bet anybody, anything in this room, that during that interview they ask her, what's  it like working with Steve Martin?  And she just goes on about how funny he is.  And how professional.  And how professional.  And just off, when we were on set, I was laughing all the time working with him. 
[01:28:00]  And he would do goofy things, like take me to the park on Super Bowl Sunday and point  to a bunch of retards and say, look at my children.  And I would try to be polite and not laugh.  And then we'd all have a laugh later because he got me.  And he'd state a character like that.  Yeah.  Oh, it's got to be a great interview.  Oh, this has got to be a gem of an interview.  All right, we'll get that on the air in a few minutes.  BCH, what's up?  Hey, morning, boys.  How are you?  All right, BCH.  Thanks for on the program.  Opie's killing me this morning.  Why? 
[01:28:30]  Number one.  Well, making me laugh.  Number one, that's not a seizure.  That's his end zone dance.  And number two.  No one laughed at that, though.  These guys don't give me shit.  That's not true.  You know how hard I have to work to make these guys laugh at anything I say in this fucking  program?  Here's why I didn't laugh at that.  Not that it wasn't funny.  You're too busy trying to think of something funny they're going to say.  It was.  How about you give me a little love every once in a while, boys?  It was such.  It was the only point that I was sad at in the whole piece.  She just said that he had a seizure and then shit his pants and was a pilot. 
[01:29:00]  It was the only part that made me sad.  And then you come back with the fucking most brutal line.  That was all.  It was just the timing of it.  They don't give me love.  That's not true.  I love you.  They never give me love.  Oh, I love you.  That and the telling the schizophrenic to stop being paranoid.  Yeah.  Stop being paranoid.  That's funny.  Where did that story come from?  Thank you.  By the way, I didn't get a laugh at that line either.  I keep track now.  Line seven?  Where did that story come from? 
[01:29:30]  All right.  Is this going around the Huntington rumor mill?  Annie, Long Island, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I listen.  I spent the weekend visiting a friend of mine at a bar over in Long Island.  And I met a customer.  What bar?  It's the Hairy Lemon over in Selden.  The Hairy Lemon in Selden.  Yes.  I'm very unfortunate to say that.  It's got to be a dyke bar.  Yeah.  Doesn't that sound like a dyke bar?  Or, yeah, let's go to the Hairy Lemon tonight.  Lemon.  All right.  Let's go to the Sour Trout. 
[01:30:00]  See, I'm laughing at your line.  It was fun, right?  It makes you feel good, doesn't it?  Yeah, but it wasn't after a child had a seizure.  Right.  Crapped himself.  All right.  Yes, Annie, you're at the Furry Lemon.  I'm at the Hairy Lemon, and I run into, because I'm visiting my girlfriend working there,  and I run into a customer who says that he knows Anthony.  Now, anybody that knows my girlfriend and I know that we're big fans of the show,  and that I have a major crush on Anthony.  He begins to tell me a story that you and your wife used to have a threesome with somebody  from the show, and that you were knocked out in a bar by your ex-wife because you turned 
[01:30:30]  around and said, well, yeah, maybe I like fucking her better.  Is this a true story?  No, that isn't a true story.  Not at all.  The true story was the part where, I guess, she lunged at my girlfriend at a bar.  We were playing at Sgt. Pepper's there in Huntington.  Exactly.  All right.  Wait, I've never heard this one.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, here we go.  Uncomfortable moment.  No, no.  It was over.  Uncomfortable.  I'm getting a run.  Dude, the marriage was over at this point.  It was done. 
[01:31:00]  It was done.  There was nothing about this threesome nonsense.  No, no, no.  Please don't.  Please don't.  You know, that's not true.  Well, no.  That was kind of happening.  It was, she was hammered and showed up.  I told her, it's over.  Don't show up at this gig.  Because we were doing, we were playing.  I was playing with the band.  And of course, I had my girlfriend with me.  And the ex-wife shows up.  Hold on.  I'm trying to explain.  Oh, my God.  I'm trying to explain. 
[01:31:30]  So, you remember how much the ex-wife hated the word cunt.  She lost her mind.  It was like, fuck, it just, you could not say it.  Not even in any conversation.  Never mind calling her one.  She would just go to a different place if she heard that word.  Yeah.  I remember that.  Crazy.  So, she comes in and then calls my girlfriend something.  And then my girlfriend turns around and says, ah, fuck you, cunt.  So, the ex-wife goes lunging at my girlfriend.  So, I get in between and pushed her. 
[01:32:00]  I was trying to get her out of the bar.  And I didn't get hit.  She fell down and smashed her head into the jukebox.  That's what happened.  And I didn't, no, I didn't get hit on that one.  On that one?  No, there wasn't any, there was no time that, I don't know where the guy got the story of  me getting, oh, well, you know.  Yes.  I don't know her.  I don't either.  It's, yeah, pretty hammered.  Now, is this the girl that you're with now, is what I need to know?  The girl I'm with now? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, is this the same girl that you're with now?  Oh, I don't know.  I was so drunk at the time.  There were 20, 30 girls in between.  I have no idea.  I'm very disturbed by this whole phone call.  I can't.  And you have a crush on Anthony?  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  What do you like about Anthony?  Yeah.  I love him.  I love him because every reference that he makes reminds me of the guys that we used  to date from Long Island.  Great.  Good.  I'm the typical Long Island asshole.  Thank you.  All right, Annie.  Bye.  Take care.  That's all you get today.  Thanks.  Say hi to Bill in Cleveland.  Bill, what's up? 
[01:33:00]  That's shoddy Cathy.  Hey, Bill.  I wanted to go on American Mass.  Who are you?  I'm Schizo Bill.  How do we know you, though?  Because I called and told some jokes.  From where?  No, you didn't.  It was really fast.  No, we've been just talking about the Super Bowl all morning.  Oh, I thought I called in.  No.  I could be imagining things.  You're trying to say you called our show?  Yeah.  When?  About five, ten minutes ago. 
[01:33:30]  And you're Schizo who?  I'm Schizo Bill.  That's a wacky name.  And you called our show saying what?  I told some jokes.  You said I was too fast.  Anybody remember this guy?  No.  No.  No.  Are you sure, Bill?  I'm a mess because I can't remember stuff.  What's the bit, sweetie?  So bring me down for American Mass.  You want to come here for American Mass?  Well, we're looking for people to come down Friday.  That would be cool.  What do you do?  Yeah, what do you do for a living?  How are you a mess?  I'm a mess because I don't do anything for a living. 
[01:34:00]  I won the lottery and I spent all my money.  Now I'm not eligible for disability.  Wow, that's a crazy...  How much did you win in the lottery?  I had a scratch-off ticket.  My voice just told me to buy it.  But how much did you win?  $50,000.  And you went through the whole $50,000?  I bought other scratch-off tickets.  You what?  I bought other scratch-off tickets.  Huh.  Wait, wait.  You won the lottery...  Now I can't afford my medicine and I'm going to be in the street soon.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[01:34:30]  You bought the lottery ticket, you won $50,000 and spent the $50,000 on scratch-off tickets?  Yeah.  What an ass.  That's great.  And now you're not eligible for disability?  Yeah.  That's so weird.  What do you do now?  I do comedy sometimes.  You do what?  Comedy.  Stand-up comedy.  Oh, you stand-up comic?  Yeah.  Let's hear some of your stuff.  Your phone stinks.  Yeah, your phone is awful.  Could you get another phone or something? 
[01:35:00]  I think the government is bugging your phone.  I think the tinfoil on your head is interfering with the signal.  Get a better phone!  Bill.  Trust me, your phone stinks.  Call back on another phone.  We'd love to talk to you about American mess.  Ugh.  All right.  Shitty phone.  Let's go to Chris in Alabama.  Chris?  Hey.  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  What's up?  I just wanted to say that I'm new to XM, and I actually got it for Christmas for my 
[01:35:30]  wife.  Merry Christmas.  And kind of took a look at what was on, and you guys are awesome.  I am so glad that I finally swapped over from, as you guys call it, Free FM.  Yeah, Free FM rocks, though.  You've got to be honest about that.  It's free.  It's free.  Which is good, because it's free.  And they're doing some terrific things over there now.  Oh!  Fantastic.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  Yeah, guys.  I don't know why you needed a call to tell us that. 
[01:36:00]  Our buddy Bill Burr is on the line.  Bill.  Yo.  Sorry to make you wait, Bill.  That wasn't on purpose.  We're just trying to go through some things here.  Hi, sweetie.  Hey, what's up, Jim?  Yo.  Yo, what did that lying cocksucker say last Friday?  Uh, Patrice?  Jesus Christ.  Because it started a whole thing on whackbag.com.  He is such...  He is such...  Like, now the listeners are voting to ban Bill...  If we should ban Bill Burr from the program.  Oh, it's hilarious.  He called up the Man Cow Show completely unprepared. 
[01:36:30]  He bombed.  It was hilarious.  And then somehow, he goes on your show and blamed it on me.  I actually...  I mean, it was a smear campaign that, like, fucking Dick Cheney should hire him.  I actually tried to save him.  Wow.  Now, this is something he would definitely deny.  Here's the setup, by the way.  Bill was in Chicago over the weekend.  By the way, people are saying you killed in Chicago. 
[01:37:00]  Want to get that out of the way.  So, he was in Chicago promoting his comedy gig.  And he was on Man Cow Show.  Someone we openly hate, by the way.  But that's none of my...  None of our businesses.  You know, yeah.  I mean...  No, it really isn't.  I mean, we have personal shit against the guy, whatever.  But we would never tell any of you guys where to go, obviously.  So, you were in studio doing your thing.  Patrice called in to promote WebJunk 20.  You're saying he bombed horribly.  And...  This is what happened.  But Patrice said, just that this is what started, that you were there and basically on Man Cow's side 
[01:37:30]  and said something like, come on, Patrice, this isn't satellite radio.  You've got to give the people something or something like that.  Yeah, no.  That's not what happened.  This is what happened.  God, he's just a son of a bitch.  Like, he calls up the show.  First of all, he kept going, okay, we got Patrice coming up, blah, blah, blah, from, you know, the VH1 thing.  I'm like, oh, this is going to be cool.  Patrice is going to be, you know, he's going to be on, right?  So, I'm in studio with, like, six other jackasses.  And in defense of Patrice, Man Cow is a dick. 
[01:38:00]  Unbelievable cock.  He's always turning down the fucking mics.  And the second I walked in, he started breaking my balls.  But, like, the club let me know.  They were like, all right, this guy is a dick.  He's going to break your balls, blah, blah, blah, whatever, right?  So, Patrice calls in.  He finally goes to Patrice.  And he was playing.  Man Cow was playing some sort of clip.  And they go, okay, let's go to Patrice.  And Patrice was kind of laughing at the clip.  And he just goes, ah, yeah, that's some funny shit. 
[01:38:30]  And then Man Cow, like, fucking eyes go crossed.  He's got to dump all the shit out.  So, he starts off on the wrong foot.  Cursing, right?  So, I say to try to save, like, like, Man Cow's going, you know, what the hell are you doing?  This is fucking free radio, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You can't do that.  And I just threw out.  I go, yeah, come on, Patrice.  This isn't satellite.  Like, ha-ha.  Like, that thing.  Looking back, I probably should have said this wasn't HBO or something like that. 
[01:39:00]  But I said that shit trying to help him out.  Then Man Cow kind of snapped.  He goes, yeah, this is free radio and it's funny or something like that, right?  So, he goes, hey, Patrice, Bill's in studio.  Do you know Bill?  And I'm like, yeah.  He goes, yeah.  And I go, hey, Patrice, what's up?  And he just gives me some half-ass, yeah, hey, blah.  And then laughed.  And I could tell right then he did not want to do the interview.  He didn't have his fucking energy was down.  He had no stories. 
[01:39:30]  He goes to do his first fucking clip.  Man Cow fucking goes, I saw that clip on the fucking internet like 10 years ago.  And right then I'm like, all right, Patrice is going to smash him.  And he had nothing.  And then Man Cow goes, all right, you're not funny.  Or whatever, the show isn't funny.  And he fucking hung up on him.  And, dude, I'm going to say right now, I fucking died laughing.  And he, that son of a bitch, this wasn't an Opie and Anthony thing.  He fucking tried to blame everybody.  This was a comedian to comedian watching another comic of your friend of yours bomb. 
[01:40:00]  It's like watching a friend of yours fall down the fucking stairs.  It was hilarious.  You know what I mean?  And not only that, Patrice is the king.  He invented that game of you're not funny, I'm hanging up on you.  He's hung up on me 30,000 times this year already.  So to see it happen to him was fucking hilarious.  And he lied and said that I called him after the show.  He called me.  I returned his phone call. 
[01:40:30]  And he tried to worm his way out of the fact that he stunk and wasn't prepared to do that show.  And he blamed me for the bomb.  He blamed Man Cow and he blamed you guys.  He goes, he goes, Man Cow knew that I was fucking on the Opie and Anthony show and blah, blah.  It's like, Patrice, you're not famous.  You host a fucking clip show on VH1.  You're the fucking black Mo Rocker.  Just fucking hype your show. 
[01:41:00]  He didn't do it.  He got hung up on it.  And then it's like, my fault?  Like, what was I supposed to do?  There was like nothing to defend.  He ate his balls.  And plus, if that happened the other way around, he would have laughed his ass off at me on the air.  And then he would have called up every comedian he knew and had a conference call and would have trashed me for an hour.  I would have laughed it off.  That would have been it.  I wouldn't have gone on Opie, you know, your guy's show and thrown me under the bus like it was my fault. 
[01:41:30]  I don't think you said it was your fault.  Like, I don't think you said that it was your faulty bomb.  You just, you know, I think you felt kind of like you kind of left him swinging.  Patrice?  Well, I speculate on what Patrice said.  Yeah, Patrice is on the line.  Well, we have him on the line.  Patrice?  Listen, I just heard that horse shit tirade Billy just said.  It wasn't a tirade.  That was the truth.  Okay.  Listen, this is exactly what happened.  Ready?  Yeah.  This is exactly what happened. 
[01:42:00]  Didn't even deserve.  See, the energy I gave the situation was mad cow.  Didn't give Billy too much energy.  Didn't throw you under the bus, Billy.  Just, you were there, so your name had to be up there.  Basically, I get on the show.  I go, oh, man.  Yo, that shit was funny.  Swore, right?  Man cow.  I said, oh, man, I'm sorry.  Apologetic.  Sorry about that.  So, Billy goes.  And you stop me, Billy, when it's all wrong. 
[01:42:30]  At what point, at what point was the morning excitement when I was bombing?  Let me know when I was bombing.  Yo.  Oh, that was some funny shit, dude.  Dude, I heard you.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Let me do it.  I know when you don't want to be doing something.  You didn't want to be doing that fucking interview, dude.  And when I yelled and I said, come on, Patrice, this isn't satellite radio.  I thought that was going to be funny, dude.  I was trying to fucking help you out.  Now, did you hear that?  I was trying to help you out. 
[01:43:00]  Now, you didn't.  So, man cow.  Wait a minute.  I didn't, like, not have your back.  You know what you should be mad at?  You should be mad at the people who told you to call that station and didn't tell you that that guy was going to be a dick.  Dude, you realize that there was six other people, six other guests in that studio on mic.  And every two seconds, man cow fucking brings all the mics down.  And I was in the studio for, like, 15 minutes trying to figure out what the fucking vibe of that show was.  And that guy kept coming at me, trashing me. 
[01:43:30]  I never said that you were supposed to save me, Billy.  I'm just telling the story.  Why do I have, like, 200 fucking emails saying that I can't believe you let you hung Patrice out to dry and all that shit?  Yeah, but that was from people's own opinion, Billy.  I'm going to tell the story again.  Right?  I'm going to tell the story again.  I get on man cow.  I go, oh, that was some funny shit.  Listening to the clips and stuff he was playing.  So, I'm trying to ingratiate myself on some corporate horse shit.  Now, I'm not disagreeing.  It was just some old, hey, watch WebJunk 20 shit. 
[01:44:00]  That's what it was.  So, I go, oh, sorry about that.  He goes, yeah, all right.  And then you go, hey, yeah, Patrice, this is not satellite radio.  I go, okay, Billy.  And he goes, yeah.  No, no, no.  Then he goes, hey, we got to go to our studio.  Yeah, this is free radio.  That's how he introduced us, Patrice.  How the fuck did you know I was already in studio?  He goes, yeah, this is free radio.  And it's funny.  All right, get to your show, man.  No, no, no.  You're skipping over the part where he introduced us and you fucking blew me off. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, okay.  That's some new shit that I didn't know about.  You were doing your, hey, I don't feel like fucking doing this.  You didn't want to fucking do it, Patrice.  How is this sounding right now?  But let me talk, Billy.  You might not sound as fucking stupid.  What do you mean, dude?  You came in there and sat there.  I didn't even get to fucking interrupt you.  You talked about me for all day on Friday.  Enjoy it.  Well, you just did.  Now, I'm on the phone.  Now, I know you're full of shit is you reached out to Voss for an alliance on Friday. 
[01:45:00]  When have you ever reached out to Voss and say, oh, you know, I'd never trash him again.  Those phone-ins are difficult.  I get on the phone.  You do what you do, right?  Then blame me.  I'm just telling you that's a part of the story, right?  So, he, man, Kyle goes, yeah, right, yeah.  This free radio, it's funny.  Good, blasey, blasey, right?  Then he perceives his boy, one of the people in the studio goes, yeah, I saw the clip about the farting preacher or whatever. 
[01:45:30]  Man, Kyle goes, yeah, I did that on my show ten years ago.  Uh, yeah, you know what's funny?  Go to, go to, uh, what's his name?  Fucking JimmyShubert.com.  He has funny stuff on his.  Yeah, all right, click.  No.  At what point?  And then you, at what point?  I'm back right there and you.  Wait a minute.  At what point was I bombing?  Right after he trashed your show and you had nothing.  There was a pause from you and he fucked it up. 
[01:46:00]  Right.  You know where the pause was?  A fucking click.  Oh, God, Patrice, you're so fucked.  In fact, you know what?  I'm not saying the guy wasn't a click.  I'm just saying, dude, let me ask you this.  If you didn't fucking blame that whole fucking phone call on as you talked to that guy,  your energy, you sounded like Shaq after a basketball game.  That was like your fucking energy.  And you somehow go on O.P. and Anthony.  Where did the energy?  You blamed the whole fucking thing on me.  Now, you see, right now, I feel ten times shittier, ten times shittier now, 
[01:46:30]  than I did on Man Cow.  Now, do you know me, Billy?  You know me that I'm not going to take somebody's fucking shit.  So, if you get on the phone and go,  Yeah, Patrice,  and I'm going, what?  And then you go, click,  and then tell me I bombed?  No, you,  Patrice, you fucked that interview up from the get-go. 
[01:47:00]  Right.  That's why he snapped on you, dude.  When I said shit.  And Patrice, I never said that guy wasn't a dick.  He was one of the biggest cocksuckers.  The second I walked in, he was fucking trashing me.  Here's what you said to me, Billy.  I fucking come back and I got, like, 200 fucking emails.  Here's what you said to me, Bill.  And that I hung you out to dry.  No, I never said hung you out to dry.  That's what people listening to the story said.  That's what people listening to the story said.  You did that.  Not me.  Oh, I get it. 
[01:47:30]  You go in and tell the story,  and 200 people hear it one way,  but it's their fault again.  I get it, and then you have a bad thing on that now,  and it's my fault.  I get it.  I get it.  Wait a minute.  Your version of the story,  does it make it sound completely different, Billy,  or does it make it sound the same?  Just because you have the energy,  just because you have the energy  to say it the way you want to say it,  the facts are the facts, Billy.  I didn't say you threw me under the bus.  I'm just saying.  Then how did, like, 30 people fucking get that impression? 
[01:48:00]  How do I yell,  hey, you're on the fuck-o list,  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You obviously said something.  No, no, no.  That's where the people...  Well, what did you say, Patrice?  Billy, anybody listening to this conversation  knows what happened.  What?  Anybody listening to this conversation  knows what happened.  How could they know what happened?  The first half...  Because I'm telling them what happened,  and you're corroborating it  with your fucking screaming.  Patrice, the first half  of the fucking phone call got dumped. 
[01:48:30]  There was no half of the phone call,  you fucking asshole.  Patrice, it was a 30-second phone call.  A half of a phone call  means if the phone call was a minute,  30 seconds of it  would have been me fucking.  You understand?  That's what a half of a phone call means.  It was five seconds.  That guy was a dick.  I never said he wasn't a dick, Patrice.  I'm just saying, if you run into a guy  and the dude's a fucking dick,  I'm trying to fucking help you out, 
[01:49:00]  and then all of a sudden  I get like 200 emails  saying that I'm an asshole,  so I'm saying you're full of shit.  You don't help me with dicks.  You don't need to help me with dicks.  You don't give me a fucking...  any motherfucking reference point  on how to defend myself verbally, nigga.  I know what I'm doing.  I taught you how to do the shit.  What are you doing?  Yeah, you laughed that off.  I taught you, Billy.  Oh, you did?  So you don't give me like fucking...  you don't tell me, 
[01:49:30]  hey, yeah, man cow,  he trashed your show  and you had no comeback,  and then he hung up on you.  You gotta defend yourself against man cow.  I don't need you to tell me that.  All I need is man cow  to put me on the phone with him,  give me the proper opportunity,  which he didn't.  Well, look, dude,  all I'm saying is I had nothing to do  with your horse shit.  That's all I'm saying.  And you definitely said some shit  or I wouldn't have had all that fucking crap  on my fucking website.  Play the fucking tape. 
[01:50:00]  That's all you gotta do  is listen to the shit.  I didn't say you were supposed to support me.  You're not gonna hear the beginning, Patrice,  because it got dumped  because you cursed.  He didn't dump me.  He dumped my God.  You mu...  Nigga, the phone call started off.  He was in studio.  The phone call started off with...  With you cursing.  He dumped all of that.  He even had that part  where he introduced you and me  got dumped.  Yes.  He dumped it.  And he...  Because you cursed.  And he dumped that. 
[01:50:30]  This motherfucker goes,  yeah, okay,  go to your show.  And I'm like,  first of all,  and this is no excuse,  but I'm on there  being a fucking corporate cocksucker  who VH1 comes back and goes,  man, you didn't even have to do no shit like that.  Thank you, VH1.  Now I'll know.  Dude, you know what?  They're the ones you should be mad at,  not me.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah,  watch the show,  you know,  comes on a Friday.  Yeah, okay.  And then somebody in the studio goes, 
[01:51:00]  yeah, you know what?  Oh, the farting preacher,  that was funny.  The motherfucker goes,  yeah,  I did that 10 years ago.  Ah, yeah.  And you know what's funny?  You know what would be a funny clip?  Go to jimmyshubert.com  and watch the fucking,  I guess the horse guy  fuck somebody,  the horse fuck the guy to death.  Go to jimmyshubert.com  and watch something really funny.  Okay, Patrice,  click.  Yeah, yeah.  You tell me in there  where I fucked you over.  Wait, can I,  I'm gonna jump in really fast  because I'm hearing both sides here 
[01:51:30]  and it's obvious that both of you guys  don't respect man cow.  Like Patrice is,  I don't,  I fucking don't.  Yeah, I know,  but,  you see that shit?  You see what he just did there?  See how he keeps setting me up  to be like,  I was out there kissing  that fucking asshole.  Yeah, but I,  I wasn't,  that guy was a fucking asshole.  I don't know if Bill said it  before Patrice got on the line,  but Bill was saying  how he doesn't respect him either  because he pulls some shit  when you go into his studio,  like he,  he trashes you  and knocks you down  and he doesn't give you a chance  because he works the microphones 
[01:52:00]  where you can't even get on mic.  Hey, Obie,  can I just say something right now?  Yeah, go.  Obie, let me just tell you something.  No, I'm not saying anyone's an asshole,  trust me,  I like both of you guys.  I mean,  Obie, let me just tell you something.  When I returned Patrice's phone call  afterwards,  I'm just breaking his balls  the way we break balls  at the cellar.  The dude hung up on him.  It's the fucking man couch show.  Who gives a fuck?  And he is immediately  just trying to avoid  the whole fucking trash.  And I mean,  I just did to him  what he would have done to me. 
[01:52:30]  He would,  he would have had to keep  on fucking freeway  and all that shit.  I was just teasing him.  That was it.  But he,  I think he was afraid  that I was going to go on  Obie and Anthony  and go,  oh my God,  Patrice blah blah blah.  I wasn't even going to  bring this shit up.  And all of a sudden  he spins it  the whole fucking other direction.  And I get all these  fucking messages  on my website  like I didn't fucking  stick up for him  and I'm a fucking asshole.  And then I called him up  to find out what he said.  And he's all fucking  giggling like a girl  like,  kihi, kihi,  I didn't say anything.  Ha ha ha.  I didn't say that. 
[01:53:00]  And shit like that.  I knew he was  full of shit.  I didn't say  he was giggling  like a girl.  And second,  if you listen,  if you listen to Billy,  I'll let him finish.  Maybe I'll get in there.  Go ahead,  Billy.  Well,  I've been listening  to you when you talk,  Patrice,  and I shut up  and you've been  fucking interoptimates.  This shit is like,  hey,  trashing you  like you trash me.  This,  hey,  I listen to you  like you listen to me.  I'm telling you,  this shit is  some shit.  Billy doesn't know  how to give shit.  I teach you 
[01:53:30]  how to give shit,  Billy.  You don't give shit.  I do.  Patrice,  you can't take a trashing.  Are you fucking  out of your mind?  Patrice,  you can dish it out,  but you can't take it.  I don't know who I am.  I don't know who I am.  And you got pissed  and then you went into  opening afternoon  and you fucking  threw me under the bus.  What the fuck happened?  Know me.  Holy shit.  You know me,  Billy.  I know I know you  and I know you  and I know you.  Stop talking like  I'm a fucking stranger.  to you.  I teased you a little bit. 
[01:54:00]  I laughed at you  and you got mad  and then you took it out  and you flipped out  and went on ONA  and trashed me.  I didn't take it out on you.  That's what happened.  And you think  that's a trashing.  If I ever heard you like that,  I would never trash you like that.  I'd be like,  man, you know what?  That motherfucker played you.  Oh, that's amazing.  Billy.  I get it.  Whatever.  Yeah, if it was the other way around.  Billy.  You would have laughed on air  and then you would have had  a conference call  with every comedian I know  and you would have trashed me.  You don't know what trashing is, Billy. 
[01:54:30]  Bling, bling, bang, bang.  What?  Sorry, just the headline  of the post today.  I thought it made sense here right now.  All right, yo.  They're telling me I got to go.  No, no, not at all.  I get what happened here.  See, Patrice,  Patrice, that pussy man cow  didn't give you a chance  to even defend yourself  on his show,  which is so lame  it's not even funny.  We allow people  to defend themselves  all the time on this show  and Patrice felt, Bill,  that you were kind of  taking man cow's side 
[01:55:00]  on the whole thing.  Is that fair, Patrice?  To sum it up?  No, no, no, no.  I don't feel like  he was taking man cow's side  at all.  Well, let me...  I felt, I felt like...  Matter of fact,  I didn't feel...  If you listen to anything I said,  it wasn't like,  hey, blame Billy.  Like, even when I said  fucking the CSI Billy,  when you...  The only thing I put on Billy  is that he mentioned,  hey, this ain't satellite radio,  which gave this cop sucker...  And it ain't blame, 
[01:55:30]  but it gave him an in  to do what he does.  I'm not saying,  hey, I'm not...  I'm famous and da-da-da,  but fucking man shitty...  Hey, uh, sweet niece.  Eric knows who I am.  Patrice.  I had like fucking 15 ONA fans  come up to me  on my Friday night show  going,  dude, what happened  between you and Patrice?  I go,  he's just fucking around.  They go,  no, it sounded kind of serious.  He's kind of fucking around,  but it sounded kind of serious.  I'm cursing out man cow.  You're part of it.  There was no joking in it, 
[01:56:00]  but it wasn't,  fuck Billy.  It wasn't fuck Billy.  It's the same energy  that Anthony used.  That's the only reason  I called in today.  When we called you CSI,  it was the same energy  that I used that with.  That's the energy  I used your name with.  It was the same energy with,  thank you, Bill,  for saying I'm on  fucking satellite.  And the reason I said  thank you on that show  the way I did  is because exactly  what he did,  it was over.  Well,  I don't know,  Patrice, 
[01:56:30]  it's funny how you  somehow didn't trash me,  but everybody took it that way  and people came to my  fucking show  saying that you trashed me.  Well,  what did they say  I said, Bill?  They basically said like,  yo,  what happened between  you and Patrice?  Yeah,  and what did you say?  Joe,  can I fucking finish?  What did you say?  Can I finish,  Patrice?  Go ahead.  They come up to me,  okay,  first of all,  I got like 30 fucking emails  calling me a dick  and I'm not loyal to the show  and I don't have your back.  I got 30 of those fucking emails 
[01:57:00]  and then I get like 10 listeners  on the Friday night show going,  what the fuck happened  between you and Patrice?  And I go,  he was fucking around, right?  They go,  no,  he kind of sounded like  he was serious.  Okay,  so you got secondhand  fucking information.  Yeah,  50 fucking people.  What did they say  I said, Bill?  That trashed you.  They said that you said  I didn't have the fuck,  I don't know exactly  word for fucking word  what they said.  Well, get the fucking  exact word for word, Bill.  Shut the fuck up  for two seconds. 
[01:57:30]  I get 30 fucking emails  and I got 10 guys  coming up to me.  I mean,  they all heard it  the wrong fucking way.  What the fuck  did they say  I said?  Oh,  you know what?  They didn't have  a fucking stenographer  there to read it  exactly back, Patrice.  So,  whatever vibe you put up,  all fucking  courtrooms  have a stenographer,  Billy,  or it ain't court.  So,  if you put me  on trial  for those fucking  fans that turned  on you for their own reasons,  get yourself  a fucking stenographer, 
[01:58:00]  Bill.  Go get one.  Patrice,  you know,  dude,  whatever vibe  you put out there,  all I'm saying  is I'm responding  to that shit.  All right,  the vibe.  All right,  well,  Billy,  I'm sorry for the vibe  I put out there,  dude.  I'm sorry,  I apologize.  I apologize.  I apologize for the vibe.  I apologize for you  getting swept up  in the shit.  I'm going to tell you  now on the air,  that energy was  towards Mankow  and what he did.  It wasn't towards you,  Billy.  So,  I apologize.  I apologize. 
[01:58:30]  I hope you're  some of these fans  who heard it  and heard me  put out a fucking vibe  accepts the apology.  Hello?  Yeah,  I'm still here.  I mean,  Patrice is pissed off  that,  you know,  Mankow is such a wimp  and didn't give him  a chance to,  you know,  go at him.  Dude,  and you know something?  I 100% support the guy  and that guy is like,  that Mankow dude,  he's a total fucking 
[01:59:00]  control freak.  He's one of those guys,  you walk in  and the first thing  he has to do  is he has to knock you down  because you got some  TV credits or whatever.  Like,  like the second I walked in,  this is the first thing  he said to me.  I come walking  into the studio,  they're doing their show,  and I kind of like  whispered to like  one of the dudes there  because,  you know,  the mics are on  and I go,  hey man,  get me some headphones  and he goes,  yeah,  don't worry superstar,  we'll get you some cans.  Yeah,  oh,  a cunt.  So this is my head,  right?  Look,  I'm not taking anyone's side 
[01:59:30]  but I want to help Bill  out a little bit  just because,  you know,  it sounds like Bill  was in a tough spot  to begin with.  Dude,  and he had seven fucking,  he's got this rapping Mexican,  right?  He's got this guy,  he's got a book,  he had some,  the lead singer  from one of those  In Excess shows,  he had his third mic guy,  the hot intern,  some loud guy,  and then there's me,  this fucking seven of us  on the fucking mic  and this dude,  every two seconds  is grabbing,  he's on the mixing board,  bringing all our fucking mics down,  his shit up, 
[02:00:00]  he is like,  I've heard many times  that this guy does  all these little tricks,  like he'll turn  your fucking mics down  because he has to be  the most important person  in the room  at all times,  Howard does the same  fucking shit.  Dude,  and then he's one  of these guys  and he,  like at the end  of the fucking show  he's going to me,  he's going,  so Bill,  so the show's off the air,  you know,  so your career's  basically over,  right?  And then I'm,  you know,  I'm fucking,  I'm like,  alright,  this guy's a dick,  I laugh,  and I go,  now dude,  I got an HBO special,  he's like,  oh yeah, 
[02:00:30]  did it air yet?  I go,  yeah,  it aired back in September,  he goes,  yeah,  I haven't seen it,  I'm like,  well it's doing great,  thanks to me man,  Cal,  it's like,  whatever,  you're,  you're,  and then I swear to God,  the second he gets off the air,  then,  then he's like a fucking,  he's like a little puppy  coming up to you,  oh,  did you have a good time  with everything,  you know,  have a good time,  and I'm like,  phony fucking ass,  yeah,  I had a great time,  whatever.  I hate that phony shit.  Yeah,  I mean,  it was that shit,  so,  it's like,  the only reason why  I laughed  when he hung up on Patrice  is because  he did it in such, 
[02:01:00]  like,  like,  kind of like a seller,  like,  I'm just being an over the top dick,  so,  when I called Patrice back  and he was saying  man,  cow's a dick,  I'm just laughing  the way I would laugh  at another comedian,  I wasn't gonna call you guys up  and go,  you know,  Patrice bombed on that show,  blah,  blah,  I wasn't gonna do any of that shit,  and then I'm fucking out there  the next day,  I gotta do man,  cow again,  because,  you know,  that's my shit,  I'm working at Zany's,  they're sending me,  I gotta do the fucking media,  right,  and then I come home  and there's all this shit 
[02:01:30]  on my fucking website  saying Patrice  fucking,  uh,  you didn't have Patrice's back,  you did this to Patrice,  you did that to Patrice,  you did this to Patrice,  never said that.  I think part of the reason  is there's such a hatred  between,  uh,  ONA and man cow  that the fans,  because I think it happened  on another show  that wouldn't have been,  like,  the fans wouldn't have reacted.  Yeah,  all our fans know  how much we hate,  uh,  that douche,  that phony ass,  so I guess they were hoping,  so I guess they were hoping  knowing that Patrice was in a bad spot  and you were in studio  that maybe they were hoping  that you were gonna  really just go at it. 
[02:02:00]  But I'll be honest,  when I first heard it,  and it wasn't the way Patrice said it,  he didn't tell me at all,  oh,  Billy fucked me,  he didn't say that at all,  he just kind of told me  what happened,  and when you're calling  into a radio show,  especially a hostile one like that,  I mean,  it's a tough phone call  and then you got a friend in studio  and you feel,  my first thought was like,  fuck man,  why didn't Bill go to bat for him?  It wasn't,  Patrice didn't throw you  under the bus when we were talking,  he didn't say,  Bill fucked me,  he just told me what happened.  Yeah,  we'll help,  uh,  free radio today.  Uh,  someone get a hold of Mancow  and,  and,  uh,  we'll put this challenge out. 
[02:02:30]  Let Patrice talk on your  fucking radio show.  Yeah.  Let's see how,  how good you really are  at this talk radio shit.  I'll have a good time talking,  but you know,  it's like,  okay,  me and,  me and Mancow verbally,  it's,  it's like going in there  and it's like trying to have  a boxing match,  but,  but you can't wear all your equipment.  Right.  Cause as soon as I go,  Mancow,  you're a this,  or man,  I'm not going to have a clever  quit with this faggot.  He knows what he did  and he knows how he is.  He'll go,  okay,  he can't talk and blah,  blah,  blah.  Fuck him. 
[02:03:00]  How could you fight with a guy  that has a fake voice?  That's what I'm talking about,  man.  Well,  I'll be telling you all about it.  Tell you a thing or two.  I'm going to tell you all  a thing or two  after this 20 minute  commercial break.  Exactly,  dude.  But it's like,  I'll have a fun time  talking to him  at any point  that he wants to talk  and that's the story.  That's the story  I was given.  What that pussy did.  But,  at the same time,  to hear Bill,  before I was on the phone,  say I was bombing  and Bill just explained  how he was in studio  for a fucking 
[02:03:30]  whatever minute.  I got some,  to get a chance  to fucking defend himself.  I got audio.  It's like two minutes.  I don't know if it's from our show  or his show.  I have no idea.  I don't,  oh,  it's a,  it's a man cow show?  Oh.  All right,  we got the actual audio.  Really?  Yes.  Oh,  we've got Patrice on.  Patrice.  Listen to this.  We got Patrice on.  Patrice.  And he already hates you  going into this.  Oh,  we've got Patrice on.  Patrice.  Hey,  hey, 
[02:04:00]  hey,  hey,  hey.  The hell do you think  this is?  Hey.  VH1?  No.  They don't know.  They should.  Do you know this guy,  Bill?  Oh,  yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Patrice.  No,  wait,  wait,  hold on a minute.  We got to give it a second  or two before we put  Filthy on.  Yeah.  So obvious.  Before we put Filthy on.  What a douchebag.  See,  that's what I was talking about.  Like,  it started off bad,  and when I said that 
[02:04:30]  satellite radio shit,  I was trying,  in my mind,  that was a fucking joke.  And the second I said that shit,  I was like,  ah,  that was like me saying  fucking Pepsi  at a Coke convention,  because now he's going to  fucking snap even more.  Right.  So,  let me,  when I called up today  and said that you were bombing,  I was just trying to give you  shit back,  because I,  you know,  because I felt like,  you know,  the shit I was reading  and all the crap  on my fucking website,  I'm like,  there's no way this dude  didn't fucking throw me  to the dogs,  because this fucking,  the response on my site 
[02:05:00]  is like ridiculous.  I even said it twice  on their show,  on ONA's show,  is,  look,  I don't even want to,  I don't want to put Billy  in no funny shit.  And that,  and that,  that's the thing,  it was about man cow.  So the,  the way the story was taken,  the energy that was,  look,  man,  it,  look,  it is what it is,  and I,  look,  I don't want you to be  in no fucking spot.  I called Opie the other day,  Opie,  man,  I hope this motherfucking shit  don't put Billy  in a fucking shitty spot.  I just don't want it  to happen like that. 
[02:05:30]  It's,  it's,  it's,  it's a man cow thing  and you happen to be there  unfortunately  and you happen to open  your big fucking mouth  unfortunately.  All right,  let's listen to the audio.  See that shit?  All right,  let's,  I open my big fucking mouth.  All right,  hold on,  we got the audio,  so let's see if you opened  your big mouth,  okay?  All I want to do here  is set it up  where obviously Patrice  was on hold  listening to Man Cow Show.  He dumped,  he dumped.  No,  I know,  I'm going to explain.  I know exactly what happened.  Something funny was happening  as Patrice was on the phone  so when they finally  went to Patrice,  Patrice gave an honest comment 
[02:06:00]  and said,  wow,  that was some funny shit.  Forgot that,  you know,  you're just talking normally  like you do  and that's why they dumped.  You know,  Patrice wasn't trying  to start any trouble.  He was like,  oh wow,  that was funny shit  or whatever he said.  So obviously if you're  on free radio,  you got to dump that crap out.  He hits the dump button.  That takes seven seconds away,  I would guess.  During that time,  that's when I go,  hey,  come on Patrice,  this isn't satellite radio.  All right,  we're going to listen.  Now we're going to pick up the tape.  All right.  Yeah.  Patrice.  No,  wait,  wait,  hold on a minute. 
[02:06:30]  We got to give it a second or two  before we put filthy on.  Yes.  Ugh.  His fourth or fifth word  was a curse word?  Yeah.  Right out of the box.  That ain't right.  Patrice.  Yeah,  sorry about that,  man.  Okay,  buddy,  Patrice O'Neal is on.  Bill Burr is here.  Billy,  what's up,  man?  No,  this isn't satellite radio.  Thanks,  sweetie.  Yeah,  no,  this is actually funny  and you don't have to pay for it.  Right.  You know,  fuck you two 
[02:07:00]  and your fight.  That guy  is a dick.  Satellite radio.  He's got to bash us,  too.  And satellite radio,  like there's nothing funny  or fun going on here.  Yeah,  nothing at all,  right?  What a cock.  Nothing at all.  Why don't you go to audible.com  and see how unfunny we are.  See,  the biggest thing being downloaded  on audible.com  because we're doing some  very funny and entertaining radio  for the people.  Bring it right back to us.  You know what's funny about doing radio now?  It's like fucking West Side Story. 
[02:07:30]  It's like you do  every fucking town you go into.  It's like everybody hates everybody now.  Yeah.  And then you throw in the extra  fucking terrestrial versus satellite  and all that fucking shit.  It's like  it's like Bloods and Crips out there  everywhere you go.  And you're just fucking trying to be like,  oh,  I'm at the Chuckle Hut this fucking weekend.  Blah,  blah,  blah,  blah,  blah.  And just  there's no way not to step in shit  on these things.  This is what I have to say  to free radio today.  Bling,  bling,  bang,  bang.  How do you like them apples? 
[02:08:00]  Tough talk.  Back to the tape.  Right.  Are they abusing satellite over there,  Bill?  No,  that's the first time I brought it up.  That was probably a bad thing.  It's like Coke and Pepsi.  Nice talking to you,  sweetie.  Sweetie.  I'll get on to your thing.  What is web junk?  Web junk,  it's a  little thing that comes off me  to 1130 on Friday nights.  It's just  me and  all of the goofy clips  you see over the internet. 
[02:08:30]  And,  you know,  it's just one of those  enjoyable little shows  that you just sit  and you watch.  It's a great show.  You just had the  Reverend farting.  Yeah.  You showed me that  a long time ago.  I've had that video forever.  They just had that on there  and it's the greatest thing ever.  What did you say?  You had it forever?  Yeah,  I've had it for 10 years.  Yeah,  I think there's some stuff  on there that's been on there  since the internet  and,  you know,  evolved.  But,  you know,  they just put me on  to like talk about it  for people who didn't see it.  You know,  I've never seen it before  until,  you know. 
[02:09:00]  Go to jimmyshubert.com.  There's a link.  And if you want to see  something great,  they've got that brothel  in Seattle of a horse.  The horse human brothel  in Seattle  and he's mixed it  into the Brokeback Mountain trailer.  It's great.  It is.  You'll never un-watch it.  Un-watch it.  All right.  Patrice O'Neal,  thank you.  It's a great show.  Not as great as  I Love the 80s.  I forgot about that shot.  Wow.  Holy shit.  I forgot about that one.  People have to lose it.  No,  you know who that was for? 
[02:09:30]  That was for me.  He was trashing me  saying,  you know,  something about me  being on  I Love the 80s.  I came in there  and I was making fun  of like how everything  on my resume  is like canceled  or whatever.  And I was talking,  you know,  Chappelle Show,  I had been on Tough Crowd,  blah, blah, blah.  And I mentioned  I Love the 80s  and that became  his dig at me.  So he wasn't directing  that at Patrice.  He was directing  that at me  and then he just  dove back  into the show again.  I'll say that guy  jumping in with  the Jimmy Schubert comment, 
[02:10:00]  that wasn't Mancow  that said,  that was another guy.  I don't know  if that was done  to slam you,  Patrice,  or if that was just  a guy raising  something.  I thought that was  Mancow.  No,  I think that was  actually just a guy  commenting like,  oh dude,  I saw this other video.  Because I think  that was the same guy  that said your show  was good and he kind of,  I don't think that guy  was trying to shit on you.  No,  but Mancow goes  to go to  jimmyshubert.com.  Oh no,  it was Mancow's guy.  Oh,  that wasn't Mancow.  Yeah,  that's his third Mike.  It was definitely  Mancow jumped on it though  and said how funny it was.  I can still suck my balls.  Yeah.  And then,  and then like, 
[02:10:30]  just alright,  Patrice,  click.  What?  Why did he hang up by that?  That I didn't get.  Yeah.  He'd just hop on you.  That's what I'm saying,  man.  I'm sitting there going,  what?  Like,  I'm doing the goofy shit  like in record time.  Yeah,  I'm hoping he clicks  but I'm hoping he goes  thank you for coming.  Thank you for having me.  But,  it's like,  yeah,  I did that 10 years ago.  What?  Hey,  Billy,  Billy,  what happened right after  he hung up?  Did he say anything?  No,  no,  he just immediately goes in. 
[02:11:00]  Like,  that show is like bizarre.  Like,  he kept doing the hate.  I don't know if it was like  a running joke.  They would do shit like,  okay,  we're going to the commercial  and,  you know,  coming up next we have  Travis Barker from,  you know,  from the fucking  Travis Barker show  or something.  And,  I was forever taking  my headphones off  thinking they were  going to commercial  and then he would  come right back.  It was some sort of  gag that they would do  and it was a really like  schizo kind of fucking show  and he does this thing  where he just points  at people  and brings their mics up 
[02:11:30]  then you got to  start talking.  Like,  he's one of those guys  where it's not like  you don't come in there  and hang out  and just shoot the shit  like on your show.  You mean real radio.  You go in  and he's like,  they're like,  it was like a test.  They go,  give him five questions  you know,  for him to ask you  and just,  you wouldn't say shit  for 40 minutes  and then he just  all of a sudden  pointed at me  and be like,  so Bill,  are you married?  And I'm like,  oh shit,  now I'm the fucking  stand-up robot  and then you just  jump in and do that shit 
[02:12:00]  and it's like  one of those deals  and it was almost  like OCD  the way he kept  bringing everybody's  mics down  and then putting his up  but it's like  as little power  as like Patrice has  on the phone  when you're in there  you have  the only other option  you have  is maybe  to run around  to his mic  and wrestle it  out of his fucking hand  to somehow  say what you're gonna say.  Yeah,  you don't get a chance  to say shit  on most radio shows.  If he fucking 
[02:12:30]  ended that call,  right?  Can you please  take that call  on the fuck-o list please?  What?  Can you take Billy  off the fuck-o list  so he can sleep better now?  Well,  Anthony put him  on the fuck-o list.  Oh,  Anthony.  Now,  now,  now let me  address that.  A lot of people  are saying that  Anthony actually put  Bill Burr  on the fuck-o list.  I caused the whole thing  because I put Bill Burr  on the fuck-o list.  Do you honestly think  that I would seriously  put Billy  on the fuck-o list?  Yes,  you're getting him back  for those comments  about your cook.  The guy that invented  the,  the guy that invented 
[02:13:00]  the mousetrap gag?  I felt tension  between you and Bill Burr  the first time  he sat in for Jim Norton.  There was never  tension between me  and Billy.  This is your payback  for all the comments  about the cook  that you're banging.  Never,  never tension  between me and Billy.  Because he's fair-skinned  and handsome.  I enjoy Billy's company.  I love the man.  By the way,  before these two go,  Bill Burr has bigger  problems anyway,  Patrice.  What's that?  I am convinced  Bill Burr was the white guy  that laughed a little  too hard at the 
[02:13:30]  Dave Chappelle bit.  Oh, dude,  that was another thing  Man Cow was doing to me.  He was going,  Dave Chappelle's on drugs,  right?  And I'm like,  no, man,  he's not on drugs.  He goes,  yeah, he is.  He's on drugs.  And I'm like,  dude,  I've hung out with the guy.  He's not on drugs.  And then he goes,  he goes,  I just saw that clip  on Oprah.  He's like,  I know people who are on drugs.  He's on drugs.  And then, boom,  then they go like  into the fucking commercial.  Nope.  Patrice and I discussed that  as I was driving back  from Philly  and Patrice has got  the angle on it.  The guy's nuts.  Dude,  the guy is nuts. 
[02:14:00]  My sister  has the same look  in her eye  and  Dave needs help.  You think so?  I haven't heard  the clip or anything.  You can't hear a clip.  You have to watch.  No, you got to watch him.  Billy,  do you think it was  the white guy  that was laughing  at the clip?  I'm going to guess  Neil Brennan.  Well,  if you look at  the Time magazine,  this shit's all documented,  y'all.  If you look at  the Time magazine thing,  Neil's quote  is that  basically  they were  corroborating each other.  So Neil's quote 
[02:14:30]  in that Time magazine,  the one with  Bill Gates  promoting  Xbox 360 in it.  Yeah.  And Neil goes,  and I'm paraphrasing  him,  I'm paraphrasing him.  He's like,  Dave said people  are laughing at me,  which he was talking  about on Oprah.  And Neil says,  how can we laugh  at you?  How can we make  you look like a fool?  You run the show.  And Neil was his  head writer and all that.  And really good friend,  by the way.  No one can make you  look like a fool.  And Neil,  according to Chappelle, 
[02:15:00]  Neil never called Dave  after he went AWOL.  How can you not call?  Listen,  if I'm on your  coattails  my entire life  and my,  fuck friendship,  maybe we're friends,  but on a business level,  $50 million  flew across the continent.  I'm gonna fucking  try to find  my half a million dollars  or whatever the fuck  I'm entitled to.  Well,  Chappelle was on Oprah  and he was doing a skit.  It was obviously,  you know,  a hardcore black skit 
[02:15:30]  or whatever.  And some white guy  was laughing a little  too hard  and Dave was like,  oh,  now they're laughing  at me instead of  with me.  And I turned to Lindsay  and went,  Bill Burr.  Oh,  Bill Burr  wrecked the whole thing.  Bill Burr  wrecked the whole thing.  Fucking Bill Burr  is Mrs. Neary's cow.  Because basically  you were the only,  it was you and  what's his name  were the only white guys  that were in skits.  And I'm like,  he had to be on set.  I bet you Bill  was laughing too hard.  Dave said that.  Motherfucking honky.  And Bill,  you blew up  everyone's spot. 
[02:16:00]  That's it.  I destroyed  the Chappelle show.  This is Neary.  I destroyed the Chappelle show.  I want to,  you know.  This is Neary.  And I didn't knock out  Mancalf.  I want to see  if this is the clip  really fast.  We got some O'Leary.  O'Leary.  Yeah,  we got some Oprah clips.  Chappelle on Oprah.  Listen to this.  I think this is the clip  where Dave explains  why he walked away.  Everybody wants to know  why'd you walk away  from $50 million?  Well,  I wasn't walking away  from the money.  Yeah. 
[02:16:30]  I was walking away  from the circumstances  that were coming  with the newfound plateau.  Yeah.  It takes a while  when you punch through  to adjust to the atmosphere.  It was completely  outside of my frame  of reference.  I've been in show business  since I was 14  and I've heard  the stories  of what happens  and I've seen  these kinds of things  play out in front of me  when I saw them.  When you say  you heard the stories,  what do you mean?  What stories? 
[02:17:00]  I mean,  you see it before.  Look,  Mariah Carey  made a $100 million deal  and three months later  she's all of a sudden  mysteriously crazy.  Or Martin Lawrence  punches through  and he's waving a gun  on the street  screaming,  they're trying to kill me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah,  we hear those stories.  And it always happens  around the time  that we came off  as being crazy.  Seems as though  they're crossing  over the next plateau.  He never answered anything.  He was just...  And Oprah goes,  and?  Right, right.  She was getting frustrated. 
[02:17:30]  I understand his point  but he's talking about  people that kind of  broke through  to that next plateau  and as they were  riding it out  caught a lot of shit  made a lot of money  but then they're  in the tabloids  and they get ripped apart.  Was it racial though?  Because he pointed out  two black people.  He pointed out  Mariah and Martin Lawrence.  Was he saying  something about  when blacks get  to a certain level  or was he just  talking about  celebrity in general?  I think celebrity  in general.  I don't know.  Mariah Carey  is an awful example 
[02:18:00]  because she was already  a multi-millionaire  before she signed  that hundred million deal.  Yeah, it seems like  alright Dave  you made the plateau  but you were up  on the plateau  for like five minutes  and decided  that it was  a little too much  to deal with.  And then  he did everything  he thought  was going to  get him  not to be  the person  that broke through  and they ripped apart  and labeled as crazy  and they labeled him  as twice as crazy.  But if Chappelle's a guy  he is in charge  if he's doing  like a bit  where he's like  I feel like 
[02:18:30]  I'm being a Sambo  or whatever he felt like  just don't do that bit  I mean you are the boss  you could definitely  fucking veto  anything you want to veto.  He could do 80 Sambo bits  where he shuffles  and tap dances  and it wouldn't cancel out  the comedy  that he put on that show  that was fantastic  and cutting edge  and what I think  would be empowering  to black people.  It was amazing shit.  I just saw  I just saw an episode  that I hadn't seen  because Comedy Central  is still cha-chinging away 
[02:19:00]  at that fucking show.  Empowering to black people  that sounded great.  It absolutely wasn't  I'd never talk like that.  I know that's why  I was laughing.  But you know  he got away with  a lot of stuff  that a lot of people  wouldn't have gotten away with  and it was funny shit.  That fucking  when they went back in time  and looked at themselves  as slaves  that is some of the  funniest fucking shit  ever.  And he walked away  from it.  Wait.  Well he talks  in this next clip  about social irresponsibility. 
[02:19:30]  And hey Opie  you gotta understand  that listening to clips  is doing this thing  an injustice  of really understanding  No Patrice  I'm so with you  I went home  after we talked  on the phone  I had it on DVR  I watched the entire thing  there is something  in that guy's eyes  that is just not right.  It's not  these clips  are  Because he's still  a funny guy  no matter what.  Very funny.  He's a genius.  He is a genius.  But it's  it's  man that dude  and if you watch  the fucking show 
[02:20:00]  man  Oprah's heart  it starts to go out  to the dude  she starts to realize  what's going on  and she stops  trying to really  interview him.  Well this is the best  this is the best clip  from the whole thing  it's where he talks  about social irresponsibility  with the bits  he was coming up with  and he also mentions  Bill Burr laughing too much  and blowing up  everyone's spot.  It's you Bill  isn't it?  It was you Bill.  And I called in man  and I cursed  and he dumped out  Yeah now I'm gonna call  Oprah  me and Dave 
[02:20:30]  are gonna argue  over the phone.  Wasn't it Bill?  Wasn't it?  It was in your tone Dave.  It's Bill Burr  that he talks about here  I'm convinced of it  listen to this clip.  Like there's this one  sketch we did  that was about  this pixie  that would appear  whenever racist  things happen  whenever someone  would make you feel  like they calling  you that n-word  but don't say it  and it was  it was funny  and the premise  of the sketch  was that  every race 
[02:21:00]  had this like  pixie  this like  racial complex  and uh  but the pixie  was in blackface  now  blackface is a  very difficult image  but the reason  I had chosen  blackface at the time  was because  this was gonna be  the visual personification  of the n-word  it was a good spirit  or intention behind it  but  what I didn't consider  is how many people  watched the show  and how 
[02:21:30]  the way people  use television  is subjective  so then when I'm  on the set  and we're finally  taping the sketch  somebody on the set  that was why  I laughed  in such a way  I know the difference  of people laughing  with me  and people laughing  at me  and it was the first  time I'd ever  gotten a laugh  that I was  uncomfortable with  not just uncomfortable  but like  should I fire  this person  Bill comment 
[02:22:00]  I mean I don't know  I thought that  that was fucking  interesting  Bill comment  I am convinced  it's Bill Burr  blew up this whole  fucking Chappelle thing  we got him on the phone  were you on set  hold on Bill  were you on set  for that bit  if you look  at my reel  from the Chappelle show  I had nothing  to do with that sketch  were you on set  for that bit  refer them to my lawyer  I'm not answering  any of them  not only were you  on set  but while he was  doing that  you were laughing  and stomping 
[02:22:30]  and pointing  and yelling  three fifths of a vote  three fifths of a vote  Bill we've spent  a lot of time  with you on this  radio show  all I want to know  were you on set  listen  I'm going to say  something right now  call Oprah  it was Bill Burr  none of the shit  I've done on your show  is admissible as evidence  you can't bring up  other crimes that I've done  to convict me of that crime  I do know that shit  I was watching it going  holy shit  Bill Burr blew up  everyone's spot  Bill is one of the least  racist people 
[02:23:00]  I've ever seen  that isn't true  you're just a fucking  white guy with an arsenal  you set the bar  so fucking high  maybe that's it  I'm just looking at  like  yeah I can look at  Klan members and go  he's a reasonable man  well Bill's a good guy  he didn't laugh  at Mississippi Burning  and you know what  Chappelle is a little nuts  because one guy  over laughing  during one sketch  the whole key is like  the whole time Dave goes  well I did this  and I did that  alright man  so it was a misfire  redo the bit  or talk to the guy  and ask him 
[02:23:30]  what the problem is  but see Norty  that's why  you like  like analyzing this thing  like on  like a certain level  is not the right place  to go  because you can  rationalize out of  each of those things  it's like  it's like if Opie goes  hey man  this motherfucker  was laughing at me  well you know what  how about this  get the fuck out  the studio boss  that's the boss talking  right  get out of my face  stop laughing  you know what  you're distracting me  with your at me laughs  now get out of here  fuck face  that's the  that's what  it's so easy 
[02:24:00]  to just say that  that's what I'm saying  each thing  like and Oprah  wouldn't  she wouldn't go there  because at some point  she knew what was  going on man  at some point  she knew what was  going on  either he's crazy  or has just the  the greatest ethics  that I've ever seen  because  if I was being offered  50 million dollars  I would stand up  on this console  naked  and have people  laugh at my penis  and wouldn't care 
[02:24:30]  I wouldn't fucking care  well now he's saying  he's gonna  he would come back  but that 50 million  he wants to give  to causes  I always honestly felt  that Dave  didn't want  Dave likes to be  on the outside  looking in  and he got sucked  into the whole  you know  you can't go anywhere  kind of famous  you know  yeah  they were doing  this little sketch show  on Comedy Central  I mean  I guess South Park  kind of blew up  but I mean 
[02:25:00]  you know  for it to take off  the way the fucking thing did  I don't think  and then he's going out  doing his shows  and everybody's  yelling out shit  I mean  I always looked at it  like until you're  in that guy's position  with all that kind  of pressure on him  I mean  I can't really sit there  and be oh  you know  you know what  I would've done  if I would've done  it this way  I would've done  it that way  I mean  I don't know  I don't know  yeah  well he thought  the bits were  social irresponsibility  on his part  which is such a pain 
[02:25:30]  that black people  have to go through  that you motherfuckers  don't  is that y'all can do  any goofy shit  you want  and not think about  how it makes  the white people look  don't fucking think  so hard  holy shit  that was genius stuff  it was hysterically funny  it was great shit  but  and some of those  to be as funny  as you want to be  you gotta be uninhibited  and sometimes  you're gonna have people  go oh  that was  you know  I didn't like  that whole thing  where he  where he put on 
[02:26:00]  the black face  and tapped  you know  was that happening  a lot of black guys  probably coming up to him  going hey Dave  I like you  someone got to him  but you know  what the fuck man  you're making us  look like  uh  sambos  we gotta represent  we gotta represent  all the black people  that's a  that's a pressure  you know what I'm saying  that's a fucking pressure  see no  you guys gotta get past  the fucking representing  for each other  and just  do what's  look I agree with you man  Jesus  absolutely agree with you  because  and I only agree with you  because I'm  absolving  absolving black people 
[02:26:30]  I'm saying  get over it  because white people  can do it  white people  can just run around  and do anything  they want  Jim Carrey can dress  as a green hunk of shit  he can dress as a  fuck  he can play a pixie  whatever he wants to do  no white people  sit around and go  ah  Jim Carrey's making us  look like buffoons  right  well  Chappelle brought up  a great point  on Oprah  saying  what's going on  with the black man  when he gets any kind  of success  Hollywood wants to  throw the black man  in a dress  and then he has an example 
[02:27:00]  he's on a set  he's doing a movie  and it wasn't even  a scene that was written  and all of a sudden  there's a dress in his trailer  and the director  or somebody comes in  and he goes  yeah  you're gonna break out  of prison with  I think it was  Martin Lawrence  and you're gonna  break out of prison  as a prostitute  a black prostitute  isn't it  that's chapter 8  of the racist handbook  yeah  and Dave Chappelle's  like I ain't fucking  wearing the dress  don't feel comfortable  and they were so  bummed out  and they're trying  to talk him  into wearing the dress  he made a pretty  good point  you know  yeah  he goes  I don't need 
[02:27:30]  to wear a dress  to be funny  if those guys  need to wear a dress  to be funny  then so be it  but I'm not doing that  what  he also go  but so and so wore  so and so  and he goes  well doesn't that  make it kind of  hack at this point  oh yeah  oh that's right  he did say  that show was so good  man  they really  if anybody  he trashed  Milton Berle though  with the dress thing  I'm like come on  alright  Miltie wore the dress  but he was funny  for other things as well  he wasn't a hack  and it was in the 50's  and he didn't have  the freedom  Comedy Central gave Dave  Milton Berle wore a dress  what was that  1954  yeah we gotta stick up 
[02:28:00]  for Whitey man  absolutely  Milton is big cock  that's right  dick homo Milton Berle  alright  so there we're at  you guys alright  yeah I'm fine  look I'm fine man  I mean well  I'm fine but  you know like I said  I apologize to Billy  for putting him in a spot  with anybody  that walked up on him  alright  I don't know  I apologize for  fucking going off  some drunk ONA's  talking about your tone  alright  well they say  I gotta go  can you guys play 
[02:28:30]  some sad music now  yeah let's play  the whole  no no we'll just  let go  Patrice is gone  alright Bill thanks  I heard you killed  in Chicago by the way  I said that earlier  I want to say it again  alright  are we promoting  anything today  no I got nothing  February 24th  25th in Albany  I'll be there  why can't I plug  during that argument  looking forward to it  oh me too  Bill this is your last  chance before people  are convinced that you  blew up Dave Chappelle's  whole thing  listen  I told you right now  I got a lawyer  and I'm not allowed to  talk about this stuff 
[02:29:00]  at this point  and uh  I couldn't even  I was just saying  in the end  the truth's gonna come out  I couldn't even  come up with a second name  I couldn't  yeah right  who else  and I knew some of the  players in that show  just you know  being around a while  and like  Bill Burr  Bill Burr  he said  it was a boom mic guy  come on man  I was talent on that  Bill's  Bill's off the fucko list  oh look at that  jackass  good luck bro  good luck  alright take it easy  bye sweetie  see you buddy 
[02:29:30]  alright that killed an hour  I like Billy  yeah no  that's  yeah  I could see what  happened there  I could absolutely see  it's the same  it's like a crash  it's kind of  sometimes you know  you see things  the same situation  in two different ways  yeah  Bill saw it from  where he was  sitting on the show  Patrice saw it  from where he was  on the other end  of a telephone  and  the common denominator  there was the fact  that Mancow  is a fucking 
[02:30:00]  cunt bag  and  the story's about him  the control freak  that he is  I mean  everyone that has  to do his show  they say that too  they go  oh I have to do his show  because comics  you gotta plug your gig  you gotta make deals  with the fucking devil  you gotta plug  your fucking gig  well he's the one  market sensation  in Chicago  good for him  so if you're  playing Chicago  he's done great  for Chicago  and that's about it  people don't go  oh great  I'm going on  Mancow's show  they go  yeah I gotta do  Mancow  because they know  it's sitting there  with a control freak 
[02:30:30]  at the mic  turning you up and down  at will  when you're trying  to get something out  it's not like  coming in here  and just hanging out  and talking like  real human beings  it's Mr. Phony Radio Voice  trying to make himself  feel better  by just knocking  everyone down  in the studio  it's better to have  everyone in the studio  knock down strangers  to feel better  about themselves  or the disabled  he has the  farting preacher video  that's been out there  forever  he's like  oh I had that  10 years ago  but you weren't  doing TV  yeah  you didn't have  a place to put 
[02:31:00]  that clip  so people could  enjoy it  but Patrice  he downloaded it  off of his  fucking 28-8 modem  yeah  this is the first time  that clip  was available  to a mass media  and Patrice  answered that  who cares  10 years ago  no one saw it  he's like  well yeah  there's a lot of stuff  that's been around  for a while  and I hadn't seen it  I mean that was  the right response  to give  he's still being cool  about it  and it's the way  it's presented  Patrice is very funny  and the way he's  goofing on the clips  and comes back 
[02:31:30]  with his little quips  and his facial expressions  makes it funny  it's not just  oh we'll show a clip  then just have  nobody standing there  and just roll  a half hour  of fucking clips  that'll be successful  right  Patrice was frustrated  because Mancow  just hung up on him  I mean if you're  such a great talk show host  let Patrice go at it  with you Mancow  you'll get beaten down  so fast  it's not even funny  so Patrice is like  god damn it  that guy you know  just hung me out to dry  meaning Mancow  and hung up on me  didn't give me a shot  to do anything  or come back at him  and then Patrice is like 
[02:32:00]  well one of my boys  is in studio  one of my comedy friends  he'll take care  of the situation  but in all fairness  to Bill Burr  Bill felt like  he was in a weird spot  because it's not  a comfortable environment  to do anything  that's a tough situation  to be in  you know it's one  against eight  at that point  or whatever  and that's what I meant  by you know  the context of it  and the situation  that Bill is in  it's not like Bill  was sitting on a show  like this  sitting in this fucking  controlling atmosphere  where what do you do  you know  it's uncomfortable  right from the start 
[02:32:30]  what a douchebag  you always gotta go  to bat for your friends  but in that situation  I mean listening to that  and knowing that he got  kind of assaulted  as soon as he walked  in the studio  that is a tough situation  to be in man  I mean it's like  you're like what the fuck  you poor motherfuckers man  gotta just travel  around the country  like some fucking carnival  go on these asshole  hack shows  to hawk your wares  I don't know how you do it  someone was telling me  recently too  that the rest of radio  out there  absolutely hates us  yeah we are  completely fucking hated 
[02:33:00]  we've been calling them out  for over a year  and now unfortunately  our comedian friends  when they travel  get the brunt  of the shit  we've been saying  for the last year  a bunch of shows  I can't do man  I'm not even kidding you  the reports I get back  from these guys  they call me all the time  and it's like dude  they fucking hate you guys  well you know what  the deal is  every month  that we are still on  and gaining more subscribers  and being more successful  they hate us even more  to them  we were supposed to be gone  after six months 
[02:33:30]  yeah remember this  six months on satellite  we disappear  they laughed at us  when we signed  with XM  oh well it's over for them  that's it  radio graveyard  but no  just about a year  and a half later  we're bigger than we were  and it's not slowing down  and it pisses them off  because they gotta sit there  and dump out of the word shit  and get all fucking pissy about it  and we can sit here  and talk about whatever we want  and we're not bringing  many shows with us  no  they're all gonna sit there  and just rot 
[02:34:00]  not good enough  they're not fucking good enough  we have a few guys  we like and we think  are good enough  and that's it  that's it  the rest of them  could burn in hell  you know what show  was really funny in LA  I really got a good laugh at it  was the John and Jeff show  oh god  did you listen to them  when you were in LA  yeah I was at my friend's house  and I was listening to the  John and Jeff program  just sounds funny  just say the name again  John and Jeff  I can't see  they were pretty funny guys  wow  following that logic  Opie and Anthony  should be really funny  because we have a really funny name  that just makes me want to kill people  the and thing really is bad 
[02:34:30]  Opie and Anthony  but it's the only thing  you can you know  after the way the fucking  Opie's parties go  this should be called  the Mary Tyler Moore  and Anthony show  Mary Tyler Moore  bad party callback  wow  my party was alright  that was cool  couple of snack tables  not bad  did you have a high def  on your TV  no  Jesus H Christ  what year is it  high definition  no I don't have the HD  you need the HD  I gotta sign up for that now too  I was on 
[02:35:00]  I just got on to the DVR  now the next step is the high def  now you gotta get them  because now they gotta come over  with a high definition  I understand  it's fine  I was watching the Super Bowl HD  and then you switch back  to regular television  and you're like  why the fuck  why are we watching  any TV like this anymore  I'm hopefully gonna move  I'm the only person in America  that will have to leave  their really nice TV behind  you know when you move  yeah  there's only a few things  you bring  one of them is the TV  right  my TV weighs 600 fucking pounds 
[02:35:30]  yeah you got one of the  I can't move it  big screen ones  whoever gets my apartment  after I'm done  gets a free TV  why don't you sell it  have someone come pick it up  on your way out  dude I bought this TV right  and literally the next month  the prices on all that other stuff  the flat screens dropped drastically  and everyone went out  and got them  it was still at that ridiculous price  where you're getting  it was like $10,000  for 32 inch  or whatever it was  every three months  do you have to go in the back  and adjust your red green  and yellow mirror  in the back  it's a really nice  picture tube TV 
[02:36:00]  but it weighs like 500 pounds  it took two gorillas  to roll it into my apartment  it's like one of the biggest  picture tube TVs they made  at the time  at the time  and picture tube  they weigh a ton  it's like 45 inch  or something like that  I'm not even  I'm not even moving  a lot of my stuff  bed goes with me  non-boogerized couch goes  yeah  and after that  everything else  is being given away  like what  I'm giving  I have a huge  wooden wall unit  that is real wood  and it's  it's one  two 
[02:36:30]  three  four  five  five sections  this thing comes in  it covers an entire wall  in any room  it would  the length of the wall  big TV goes in it  the glass cabinets  for your electronics  and  knick knack  and  prick-a-brack  prick-a-brack  prick-a-brack  and  all that shit  staying  my huge  behemoth  headboard  for my bed  which is also wood  I went through this phase  where I finally was able  to buy furniture  and I bought 
[02:37:00]  the biggest  like  hugest  wooden furniture  things  it's got sliding  this huge  mirror above it  it's one of those  those things where  you're having sex  and you gotta look at your face  going  when you look in the mirror  that's gotta go  big wooden thing  don't want them anymore  I wanna see  I wanna see Anthony's headboard  just to see if there's  like the stain  from the Italian  male head  because Anthony  likes to be fisted  the secret's out  hey speaking of my 
[02:37:30]  Superbowl party  I wanna thank  E-Rock  he came over  with the cooler food  I heard that  that's very nice  of E-Rock  and a case of beer  you didn't think  I was gonna have  food or something  you didn't have  a dresser  till several months ago  what kind of beer  did you bring  Yingling  they were all out  of Guinness  the place I went  how about Bud  was there Budweiser there  you went from Guinness  to Yingling  or whatever the hell  it's called  that's a big drop off  yeah  is Yingling  like a dark  what is Yingling  it's a lager  it's a fake Guinness 
[02:38:00]  or is it  no it's a lager  it's like an amber  it's just kind of  a slightly darker beer  you know what  it's either  here are the three  levels of beardom  there's Budweiser  that's as low  as you should go  I'm not saying  I love Budweiser  I could drink that  shit forever  love it  but that's like  the bottom rung  you shouldn't come  with anything cheaper  than Budweiser  then up in the  middle area  you got your  Sam Adams  I like their variety  I like the lager  good stuff 
[02:38:30]  and then up a little  further is your Guinness  but you need the widget  right  you know it can't just  be the bottle Guinness  Danny brought over  a bottle of red wine  he goes I don't know  if this is good or not  I kind of knows his wines  what was it  I whispered to myself  well it's not  was it from the  Boone's Farm  or Orchard  Orchard  Orchard  I don't even  say Orchard  I don't even think  you went to a liquor store  they shoot grape arrows  at your mouth  I don't even think  you went to a liquor store  I'm convinced  it was a re-wrap  oh really  yeah of course it was  some of Farid's wine 
[02:39:00]  I got a confession  to make though  I'm actually a very  nice guy  in my real life  thank you  oh  alright  yeah you're a gem  and your real life  is between 7pm  and 7.15  what do you consider  I'm a sweetheart  I gotta tell you  why  were you eating  a lot of E-Rock's  buffalo wings  I'm a sweetheart  and I'll explain  right now  alright  which will make me  the biggest asshole  on the planet  E-Rock  oh  oh 
[02:39:30]  the face he just made  it's like he was smiling  and then he just goes  oh no  this is about me  E-Rock  I got a confession to make  oh no  you came in with the cooler  right  and the wings  you hear me whispering a lot  you call me whispering  to Jimmy right  yeah  don't worry  I'm not gonna talk  about how you needed  to get all the blue cheese  with the chicken bone  that was left in your plate  that's not what I'm getting at  it really was  was he using the bone  as a simple tool  to dig up the  it was like watching a pickin' 
[02:40:00]  and he soaked something up  with a fucking biscuit  that's not what I'm getting at  he actually came in with wings  which was very nice  and he slaved in the kitchen  you made them yourself?  like Mr. Mom  yeah  they weren't even prepared  he cooked them fresh  and everything  I'd have felt good  if somebody just brought  like boxes of the wings  you throw in the oven  dude he was  it was like  he was a domestic woman  he even walked out  with an apron  and a black eye  I don't know where  it came from  and we were  no joke  we were so close  to knocking the tray  of wings out of your hand 
[02:40:30]  yeah  I was trying to figure out  if I could get away  with it in my own place  and I just  I couldn't go there  I'm kind of bummed  do you have a little  name for them?  because a lot of people  if they make their own wings  you can't just call them  buffalo wings  they gotta be like  E-Rock's  rockin'  hot  super wings  come on  no  no name  you don't name them  E-Rock  chicken wings  but the wings were  a big hit right?  yeah  everybody liked them  yeah  yeah  so you thought  oh no  what  what do you mean? 
[02:41:00]  the people didn't taste bad  I didn't have any  um  did I have any  E-Rock?  I didn't see you eat any  you said you did  but I didn't see you eat any  I hope he's known  for eating healthy foods  no but I'm also known  to not be a freak about it  on the weekends  and I'll have a chicken wing  Superbowl Sunday  you'll have a chicken wing  you'll have a chip  but I did tell you  I had the wings right?  yeah you did  yeah I didn't have any  I didn't think you did  guys did you guys  have any of the wings?  wait  they're all  Nathaniel said no  every one of them 
[02:41:30]  is shaking their head no  and he said no  who else was there?  Nathaniel is  copying to one wing right?  that's fair enough  none  oh none?  he said I didn't have  none  he goes not one  how many of the boys  said they had your wings  there E-Rock?  I didn't ask  but there was a couple  other people at the party  that I did see  eating the wings  well didn't you  okay then he must have  had a whole bunch  of them left over  how many were left over?  I don't know  they're in your fridge  there's like  one or two Tupperware  things full  but you looked at it  it looked like  you know  they were enjoying  the wings right?  be honest  they look like 
[02:42:00]  they were a hit right?  I guess so  yes  oh no  I can't sit in for this  why?  the wings were a hit  that's cool  well  and this is where  I'm a dick  this is where  like my  my brain  fights with  with itself  because I am  a nice guy  but then I have  to point out  stuff that is  horrific  did you notice  that you were  being distracted  a few times  during the game?  people were drawing  your attention  somewhere else? 
[02:42:30]  no  oh they were good  then  which is  which is perfect  what like  asking questions?  just making sure  that he wasn't  going to turn  to his left  and look into  the kitchen  what's an example  like hey  Iraq  whatever  what do you think  I don't know  it wasn't my job  it was kind of  their job  to kind of  distract them  say something  like that  it would get  him his attention  yeah well  who's wrestling  tights are these?  well they were  distracting him  so he wouldn't  look to the left  into my kitchen  yeah  Lindsay and I  are quickly  taking wings  and throwing  them away 
[02:43:00]  real fast  so it looked  like people  were eating  his wings  because we  wanted him to  no  we wanted him  to feel  like he was  fitting in  and people  were enjoying  the food  he brought  you won't  even look  at Eric  you were  throwing  hawk's wings  out  just so  he slaved  over a hot  stove  just so  he would  get the feeling  that people  were eating  his food  he brought  a cooler  because no one  was eating  the wings  I mean he  said a few  of the other  people were  they really  weren't  maybe one  or two  oh 
[02:43:30]  Jesus  Christ  don't say  and we  looked at  the tray  it was like  wow  no one  is touching  these things  and I  kind of felt  bad  like oh  my god  Iraq  slaved over  these wings  he's trying  to fit in  so as he  was not  looking in  the kitchen  oh my god  this is horrible  we would quickly  open the oven  and I was  taking like  you know  paper towels  and grabbing  three and  throwing them  away real fast  oh my god  you're saying  that he hurt  his back  carrying a  cooler from  wherever he  lives  and nobody  liked his  food  I don't know 
[02:44:00]  if they  they just  didn't want  the wings  and I  thought he  would feel  bad if  all of a sudden  like after  slaving you  know for  an hour  that the tray  was pretty  much filled  to the top  except for  the ones  he ate  what  what else  was available  to eat  well apparently  nothing  because I  got phone  messages  saying that  Ope said  there was  going to be  food and  yeah there  really isn't  I hope you're  bringing the  wings  who left you  those phone  messages  Danny  I had  the phone  so Danny  did a little  recon  he was  forward recon 
[02:44:30]  and  scoped out  the apartment  and realized  there wasn't  any food  no no  Danny  what did  he have  no you're  buying into  it too  Anthony  the fact  is there  was plenty  of food  they were  what kind  of food  they were  fucking  with him  first of all  it was  actually  Travis  sorry  it was  actually  Travis  but no  there was  food there  there was  chili  a bunch  of pizzas  chili  oh okay  chips  the pizzas  came after  I was already  there  we weren't  gonna  we ordered  them around  half time  chips  and dips  one thing  but you know  food  food 
[02:45:00]  doing food  was chili  that was  good  it was  chili  and  we cut  up cheese  and pepperoni  and there  was nuts  and pretzels  and chips  the big  eight foot  hero  no  bunch of  cheese  broke back  party  there was  enough food  for everybody  and enough  beer right  oh plenty  plenty  yeah  beer is very  important  so they  were the  ones  fucking  with  eroc  saying  you know  you know  playing off  the fact  that I  didn't have  anything  in the last  part  so I was  like oh  my god  he has  plenty 
[02:45:30]  of wings  so he  brought the  wings  he cooked  them out  yeah  and that's  but he worked  on them  we were feeling  bad we didn't  want him to  see a tray  filled with wings  so we figured  if there was a lot  missing people  were enjoying  something that he  prepared with his  own little hands  so you wanted  them to feel  better  so then you  decided to tell  them this in front  of two countries  you wanted  them to feel  good for a  matter of hours  I acknowledged  that I said  I have a problem  in my brain  where I fight  and this was  after the good  and evil fight  all the time 
[02:46:00]  in my head  I'm like I  know I'm a nice  guy so I'm  going to do  this for him  we're going  to throw  some wings  out so he  doesn't notice  that no one  was eating  his wings  kind of like  picking up the  football for a  retarded boy  changing his  crappy diaper  that's right  and tell him  it's okay  he's  and then he  went to the  bathroom once  and we're  like quick  we can get  rid of five  more  it was just  during the whole  game  honestly Eric  were you deep  down kind of  like feeling  like the cock  of the walk  like ah the  old wings are  a hit  no  bones and all  I don't even  see any scraps 
[02:46:30]  no but on the  way home I  was thinking  I'm like you  know what I  didn't get  regged too  much there's  going to be  something tomorrow  that they know  that I don't  that I'm going  to get  paranoid  he had the  my wings  are a hit  stress  how you doing  ah pretty good  enjoying the game  the wings are  a hit  the wings are  a hit  they ate them  so fast  I didn't even  see any red  stuff on  their fingers  they eat them  whole  and then the  rickety computer  chair  fucking Nathaniel  writes a note  reserved for  E-Rock  it was the  worst chair  not even  close  like it wasn't 
[02:47:00]  even close  I had a  couple nice  you know  a comfortable  couch  and a few  lounge chairs  terrible man  and this  rickety thing  that the back  barely stays on  it was  reserved for  E-Rock  so you thought  your wings  were a hit  and it didn't  strike you  it was odd  that one  garbage bag  had 75  animals around  it  yes Nathaniel  and the fact  that E-Rock  actually ended  up on your  hearth  he was on  your fireplace  the whole  night  sitting on  the fireplace  the slab  in front of  the fireplace  the cold  granite slab 
[02:47:30]  yep  just eating  wings that  nobody else  will touch  just a lonely  man eating  his own  concoction  and lapping  up the blue  cheese with  the bone  that made  us laugh  pretty hard  that's right  you love  those creamy  what was that  line you had  come to  Ope's party  relax and  be judged  yes  that was  that's the  motto for  Ope's party  I truly  is that it  sit down  relax and  be judged  I truly love  Nathaniel's sarcasm  he's the greatest  like all of a sudden  it's near the end 
[02:48:00]  of the night  and I go  guys by the way  Lindsey and I  have been keeping  track of how many  beers you've been  drinking  and that's when  he came up  with this line  he goes  can't we just  come over here  and not be judged  ever  do you know  right now  there's just  the screeching  of seagulls  as they're  diving onto  the dump  grabbing your  wings  flying off  of them  they're ignoring  everything else  except for that  one  they can't believe  some asshole  threw out  perfectly good  wings  all these  wings  just diving  on them  and I knew  these guys  were coming  over  so I tried 
[02:48:30]  to hide  some stuff  that would  be uncomfortable  what valuable  oh I thought  you said  uncomfortable  what you  fucking  check stubs  why is there  why are there  two commas  in this one  I don't have  any commas  in mine  well it was  a good month  what can I  tell you  see that was  a good line  now I'm playing  Voss  but then  they discovered  that there's  a very very 
[02:49:00]  uncomfortable  picture in my  apartment that I  forgot to get  rid of  that now I  have to throw  on the website  unfortunately  I was trying  to avoid  this  what is it  go ahead  I don't give  a shit  well this is  some amusement  park ride  it's called  the slingshot  is that correct  you know  it's those  yeah  oh I've seen  that where  they pull you  up  yeah this one  is where  they pull you  up in a harness  from the ground  they get you  I don't know  well over 100 feet  I would have to  say and then  you pull the rip  cord and then  it's free fall  you feel like  you're flying  over the ground  no well  that's terrific 
[02:49:30]  but before that  it's total fear  if you're like  me in hate heights  and you're dropping  and you're convinced  you're going to hit  the sand  and then at the  last second  it swings out  thank god they  don't take a picture  at a certain point  of that ride  yeah you probably  look like a real  asshole  right  they had a big  laugh at the  picture  it's brutal  is it prominently  displayed  it's just  could only be  described as  they captured  pure fear  on my face  what do you  have it on a wall  it's just  it was in a frame  you know  nicely positioned 
[02:50:00]  right behind the couch  last time I saw  that face was  when you were  on a cell phone  in august  of 2002  me and dummy  sipped ice lattes  no idea what was  coming  hey what's  happening  who's that  he's talking to  bob  it's gotta be good  these guys  discovered  maybe a pay  increase  these guys  discovered the  picture and all  I could think  in my head  was oh shit  forgot to hide  that one  yeah we all  have those photos  so now I'll  bring it in  tomorrow  we'll get it  on the website  I guess  oh good 
[02:50:30]  there's a great  picture of  Ope and Kinison  which really  annoyed me  I was very  jealous  he's fucking  six years old  oh boy were you  rapable when you  were fucking  a younger gentleman  holy shit  it's not even a  gay thing  you were just  sexless  you were just  a blonde haired  fuckable creature  I don't care  what  you look like  Ellen  just a young  spry Ellen  I have acid  washed jeans on  that's how long  that was  that's a great  shot  and a sweater  that is obviously  a Christmas sweater 
[02:51:00]  should have been  a Dateline crew  at your house  every day  no kidding  no kidding  alright well  we should take a break  we got Jim Gaffigan  star of one of the  Super Bowl ads  where is he  outside the studio  we'll talk to him next  he's got a new DVD  out called  Beyond the Pale  and it's terrific  and he thanks us  on the DVD  doesn't he  all three of us  no  wait what do you mean  though  but guys  I want to be thanked  geez they really  paled him up  for that cover  let me see 
[02:51:30]  it looks a little  overexposed  it looks like a  white cover  you can barely see him  why is he holding  a white spoon  and wearing a white  t-shirt that makes  it more pale  it's the whole  pale thing  yeah  why doesn't he  spell it right  playing it up  we'll go to break  this is the last day  we're accepting  Emily Stern remixes  oh that's it huh  and then we're gonna  give the whole  I don't know  stack of crap  to the boys  and they're gonna  pick the top ten  I guess  and we'll end  that bit finally  okay  goody 
[02:52:00]  so today's the last  day we get the  Emily Stern remixes  in from the fans  I checked out  27 over the weekend  that came in  there's like three  that are worth playing  I thought this one  was worth a laugh  as we go to break  you put my vagina  out  in you put  my vagina  out  you put  my vagina  in and you  shake it all about  you do the  honky pokey 
[02:52:30]  and you turn  yourself around  that's what  it's all about  you put  my breasts  in you put  my breasts  out  you put  my tits  in and you  shake it all about  you do the  honky pokey  and you turn  yourself around  that's what  it's all about  you put  my ass  in you put  my ass  out  you put  my ass  in and then  you shake it  all about  why you  swing on me 
[02:53:00]  it's shameless  plug time  Dave from  New York  what's going  on  yo  OB went to  your brother's  restaurant last  night  on Friday night  yeah  it was really  good man  I'm hearing  rave reviews  I'm hearing  that the food  is great  I still haven't  eaten there  myself  because I  went before  the Islander  Ranger game  he wasn't  ready to serve 
[02:53:30]  for the first  time  so I'm  actually going  to be there  this weekend  no he's  been in the  business his  entire life  so I mean  he's taking  this very  seriously  we remodeled  the whole place  it's the real  deal  does he serve  steak  absolutely  yeah  what's the  name of the  restaurant  FH Riley's  in honor of 
[02:54:00]  my dad  who passed  his initials  FH and  then Riley's  one of our  nieces  FH Riley's  in Huntington  400 New York  Avenue  the food was  great  food was  great  the appetizers  were unbelievable  and dinner  was great  everything was  awesome  he had a  great weekend  I want to  thank all the  pests that  went there  man because  the place  was mobbed  Friday and  Saturday night  mobbed  hopping on  Friday for  sure  it's becoming  a scene  already  it's unbelievable  some people  were turned  away because  it was mobbed  if you want 
[02:54:30]  to go early  that might be  your best bet  on Friday and  Saturday  out in front  with Opie  standing there  thumb up  thumb down  not yet  no  we'll get to  that point  though  we just need  people in the  door at this  point  but there's a lot  of confusion  you're not getting  in with that  shirt on  can you imagine  I start playing  that dumb game  jacket only  yeah but  really fast  there's some  confusion there  because the  whole family  is pretty much  working at the  place  my brother-in-law  is behind the  bar  fish  go in and say  hi to fish  and then there's  a guy walking  around an older  guy in a  tuxedo  and people are 
[02:55:00]  like what the  hell's going  on  one guy goes  had a great  time but  it's kind  of schizo  because you  got an old  guy in a  tuxedo and  then you got  a dude in a  pantera shirt  what the hell's  going on in  this joint  the old guy  he's not even  that old  is fish's  father and  he does  magic tricks  all right  but he blows  your mind  with what he  can do  his sleight  of hand  is amazing  so that  that's the  guy that's  wearing the  tux because  there was some  confusion on  the websites  all right  hey Dave  thanks for  supporting us  I appreciate  it  no problem  man have 
[02:55:30]  a good day  if you really  like the food  tell your  friends  I will  definitely  for sure  all right  it's FH  Riley's 400  New York  Avenue in  Huntington  that's our  joint and  we're pretty  proud of it  Jim Gaffigan  in studio  he had to  wait outside  for an hour  we apologize  for that  I like  waiting  it's fun  out there  it sucks  out there  it's good  for the  self-esteem  you feel  important  you're like  wow  we knock  you down  a little  bit  and then  you're like  you know  I really  better perform  when I get  in there  or they  might not  even invite  me back  next time  now you're  pointing at 
[02:56:00]  me  I guess  I have  to be  funny  no  yeah  Mike's  on  and go  he was  you know  a star  of one  of the  Super Bowl  ads  last night  that was one  of the ones  I liked  by the way  especially  when you  put the  glove on  that was  good  it was a  dirty  glove  too  yeah  I  understand  that  it was  one of  the better  ones  I thought  in general  the commercials  were  who cares  really  yeah  I don't  know  there was  one  where  there was  the girl  the woman  that was  trying to  get out  of her  seat on  an airplane 
[02:56:30]  she ended  up on  that guy's  lap  I thought  that was  pretty funny  but we  were kind  of bummed  how the  one commercial  where the  girl gets  just knocked  out on the  football field  oh I don't  know if I  saw that one  oh my god  they were  playing football  you know  a friendly  game and  the boyfriend  just takes  her out  as she  catches the  ball  just destroys  her and slams  her down the  ground  I don't even  know what  the commercial  was for  Bud Light  I think  was it a  Bud Light  commercial  and then  they had  to play it  safe and  at the  end of  the game  he's like  at the  bar  kind of  proud of  himself  that he  took his  own  girlfriend  out  and she 
[02:57:00]  comes from  nowhere  and blind  tackles  him back  like why  didn't you  just leave  it how it  was  see we like  the meanness  of things  but you can't  be mean to a  woman  you can't be  mean to a  woman in a  commercial  it's not  nice  it's not  nice  that ain't  right  I did a show  once called  Fugliest Rock  Stars for  MTV one of  those clip  shows  we thought it  was going  to be a hit  I just  had to be at  least two  episodes  that was  nominated for  an Emmy  it was really  good I just  commented on it  and I pointed  out I'm like  why are these  all male  why are there  no female 
[02:57:30]  rock stars  to trash  that'd be  kind of  mean  but the show  is called  Fugly Rock  Stars  that's what I  don't get  they sort of  want to go  into the  edgy stuff  they don't  they want to  be safe  when they  do it  well I  bet that  guy from  what's his  name  Hal Sparks  I bet  he had  a lot  of funny  witty  things  Hal's  always  good  on  those  clip  shows  boy  did he  hate me  on the  tough  crowd  he hated  me  I gave  the old  slam the  door trick 
[02:58:00]  while I  asked him  a question  I love  this gag  and how  could anyone  not laugh  if it's  pulled  on you  oh he  was a  little  bitch  about  it  in the  dressing room  you've  done  tough  crowd  in the  dressing room  you get  all  sit around  and so  I'd stand  by the  door  and say  so what  are you  doing  on the  road  lately  and as  soon  as they  start  to get  like a  full head  of steam  I slam  the door  and walk  out  so in  mid-sentence  they're just  cut off  of course  Stephen Colbert  fucking loved  it because  he's funny  Jeff Garland  got mildly  annoyed  but Hal Sparks  was hot  under the  collar  oh that's  funny  that's 
[02:58:30]  good to  do  what a  baby  shut up  some fun  sorry I'm not  commenting on a  hair do  on VH1  you fucking  douche  maybe fake  faggot  isn't he  on that  gay show  I think  he's straight  though  I'm laughing  because Matt  in Arizona  has something  for Jim Gaffigan  Matt what's  up  hey guys  I was just  mentioned I saw  Gaffigan a month  ago in Arizona  and his  description is  definitely like  Phil Simms on 
[02:59:00]  a bender  what was it  a month ago  he says you  look like  Phil Simms  on a bender  I thought it  was Boomer  Esiason  Phil Simms  oh you got  the Boomer  in you  yeah  and the Phil  Simms  or Carl  Mecklenburg  if you're  from Denver  who's that  yeah  you girls  don't know  football  can you go  to the instant  feedback  someone had  something on  here it is  asked Jim  Gaffigan about  the Pale Man  cartoon he played  on Conan a few  nights ago  it was hilarious  that was Pat 
[02:59:30]  from Monocchi  by the way  Pale Force  it's this  animated thing  we do on  Conan where  we fight crime  with our paleness  we shoot lasers  from our nipples  you could be  on there  I'll take a  spot on Conan  any time  there you go  I'll play an extra  I'll just be in  the background  I'd like to be  on Conan  you're not pale  enough  but I want to be  for other reasons  I want to sit down  and talk to him  I'm still getting  used to you  with hair  it's coming off  it's creepy  it's coming off  no you really 
[03:00:00]  need to keep  the hair  I swear to god  I was going to  grow either a  mullet or a  rat tail  a mullet  would be great  do a mullet  your hair grows  very quickly  I know  you should go  for the mohawk  for a little bit  yeah do the mohawk  just come in  with a mohawk  tomorrow  do something  yeah  I don't know  how to come  angry  I never did  or do a Mr. T  just something  stupid  I don't know  how to do that  just do a Mr. T  or something  just really stupid  just leave like  this big chunk  above your ear  and nothing else  just patches  walk around  drooling 
[03:00:30]  old cancer head  during the break  we were talking  to Jim Gaffing  and first of all  we gotta congratulate you  you're a father  I am a father  so we were talking  about that a little bit  they do that  on the comedy circuit  and Letterman  and stuff  and Leno  when you say that  I'm a new father  just wanted to  thank you  thank you  the irony is  that I'm a priest  I don't have kids  what the zing zang  but you  you were saying 
[03:01:00]  that fatherhood  is tough work  it is hard  it's impossible  but people treat you  differently  when you're holding  a newborn  especially in strip clubs  hey what the  zing zang  no it is hard  it's like  they're always  I got two under  two years old  oh you got two kids  oh you were one of those  it's like living  with orangutans  they're just always  pooing  and I'm trying to  check my  MySpace account  thing  and they're like  sitting there 
[03:01:30]  changing poopies  they're just  blowing up your spot  you totally get  immune to the poopies  though  you're like  well it's not that bad  which one was  unplanned  to have them  that close together  I'm married to a  Catholic girl  so they're all  could be any time  there's nothing planned  there's the old  Irish twins thing  just get right back  on the horse  it's a lot of chaos  I got a brother  who's barely a year  younger than me  I'm like mom  what were you thinking  seriously  you give birth 
[03:02:00]  and you have to  sit out of the game  for what  four or five weeks  right  I think it's hard  to get pregnant  before six months  after you have  the first  after you have a kid  supposedly  particularly if you're  breastfeeding  it's Jim with his baby  oh yeah  there's me and my baby  wow  what is that from  is that from my  website  it's not  it's not from your  MySpace account  because you're not  going to get chicks  you're not going to  get chicks with  pictures like that  well I'm not  do you know  no I do actually  do you actually  use MySpace

[03:07:30]  legitimate  discussions  and you  have to  look at  one  and whoever  you look  at  the other  guy  just keeps  telling  a story  it's so  hard  to do  I've had  that just  happen  without  people  trying to  be  idiots  like  they're  just  that's  how  they're  trying  to  carry  on  a  conversation  Rob  Cullen  was  the  best  because  they  would  all  look  at  dice  because  he  was  dice  and he  would  just  start  talking  but Rob  would  just  keep  going  and then  I  moved  from  Philadelphia  and I  wanted to  buy  these  shoes  but I  wasn't  too  sure  and eventually  the guy  just looks  back at you  and Rob  is still in the  conversation  and then he  has to pull  away to go to  dice  oh it was  really good  that's great  when it's done  right  yes  I went through 
[03:08:00]  so many years  of turning my  head back and  forth  like yeah  yeah  yeah  uh huh  and trying  but now  the finger  goes up  now  is talking  and then I  gotta listen  to two  idiotic  conversations  there's a way  to handle  double talk  by the way  how  you have to  make a noise  a noise  what type  of noise  let's go  to Tampa  con what's

[03:14:30]  all you said was hi  hey how you doing  like everything  just happy to be there  over eager  here's what else  I was doing  trying to entertain  I was just trying  to make an impression  like with everything  I said  I couldn't just  converse  everything had to be  in a voice  or a bit  so shut up  I didn't say  I didn't mean to  because I thought  that if I did that  if I threw as much  shit out as possible  something would  catch his attention  apparently it did 
[03:15:00]  okay what else  what else  shut up  no  I want to keep talking  we've never gotten  past this point  Anthony  shut up for a second  it's only 16 minutes  long this track  we're 30 seconds in  authors of  Gun Electric Shock  OJ  which you're going to  do live on the show  tonight  that's right  and you're going to  do other ditties  yeah other  wacky kooky stuff  why did I do that  wait because  you want to  you want to please  so you're talking  in impersonations  you think you 
[03:15:30]  must have no people  why did I put on that voice  I don't know  what voice is that  who's that an impression of  it was some kind of  wacky kooky guy  alright hide your face  again  I don't know  I can't  hide your face again  exactly  because right now  I'm doing an impression  of someone that used to  like you  holy crap  shut up  come on  we've only played  46 seconds  come on  let's hear a little bit  shut up  hide your face  over there  we're going to play  a little more  yeah other 
[03:16:00]  wacky kooky stuff  we're a little bitter  we gave Eddie Vedder  the idea  to do that  yeah  yeah there you go  that's what someone  just said  you know they heard  Pearl Jam's version  of sitting on the  dock of the bay  and they were expecting  to hear the OJ version  he sounded like  it was heavily sedated  alright I need a ruling  I started a new bit  yesterday  celebrity death one  my bits weren't that  good back in the day  why that sounds great  celebrity death one  this is not just me  alright look  we've heard enough 
[03:16:30]  Jim Gaffigan's in studio  we've got to get  plugs in for his DVD  Beyond the Pale  let me ask you a question  how did fucking  two awful entities  come together  and make a positive  I don't know  how did that happen  what was the marriage like  I mean if that  you know it doesn't  sound like it was  that bad  it was so bad  did you sit there  and turn to him  and go we should  do this together  this should go  to a major market  after this show  I was convinced  that we had something  yes  I don't know 
[03:17:00]  what was the bit though  I don't remember  shut up  the DVD player  it just jammed on us  just try it for a second  what's the gorilla joke  tell the gorilla joke  I don't remember it  it was some bad gorilla joke  you had  oh  when I first started  doing comedy  yeah  it was awful  help me  my idea of being funny  was saying that  Connecticut was snooty  that was me being  kind of clever  and upper echelon  and when they say  that they don't eat  I don't remember  hit play  no  you know what  you better remember 
[03:17:30]  you better remember  the joke  the CD player  will unjam  after you give the wine  I'm trying to think  they don't  I even didn't avoid  so I was saying  in Connecticut  they don't eat  chunky monkey  they eat obese primate  no I think  I  I think in my first  thing  my first stand up  I had a Casey Kasem  impression  oh you did  could you do that  for us  I might  coming up  yeah no  it was just like  I might have one  on this very DVD  it's like  this CD  I think I did one
