<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with the usual vulgar and offensive banter from Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, punctuated by a comedically repetitive intro.  They discuss and critique a new intro created by Troy Kwan.  A substantial portion of the show is dominated by a relentless interrogation of intern Rob concerning his cancelled pool party.  The initial explanation—bad weather—is immediately dismissed by the hosts and guests, including Sal and Travis (who arrive later in the show), as implausible.  Rob's increasingly contradictory accounts, relayed primarily through private Facebook messages, are dissected with escalating sarcasm and disbelief.  Inconsistencies regarding guest count, food and beverage purchases (especially the number of beers), and Rob's methods of communication are relentlessly highlighted.  The presence of his mother's cookies becomes a recurring, absurd motif.  Rob’s explanations repeatedly fall apart, revealing deleted texts, inconsistent timelines, and accusations of lying about the reasons for cancellation—first blaming low attendance, then unexpectedly assisting his brother's move, further compounded by his mother's alleged phone use and multiple contradictory statements about the dates.  The hosts’ skepticism is reinforced by a caller who offers information contradicting Rob's story.  Rob eventually confesses he downplayed the party's poor turnout to his parents and that helping his brother move took longer than expected.  A bet is made and settled regarding Rob's height (5'5 1/2").  The hosts also attempt to contact two women Rob allegedly engaged in sexually explicit conversations with, only to reach voicemail. Rob is also revealed to have solicited sexual favors via text message.  The discussion involves frequent use of offensive language and sexually suggestive comments.  The segment culminates in Rob's admission of deception and an apology.  Bert Kreischer's comedy club appearance with Opie and Anthony is mentioned, along with an incident involving Roland that led to online confusion and trolling. The hosts express their disdain for Twitter users.  The "F.U. Line" is frequently referenced, along with mentions of Uncle Paul and various celebrity shout-outs.  A commercial for "Fifty Shades of Gay" is aired.  The show also covers several celebrity deaths, notably those associated with Dr. Drew's rehabilitation shows, and the death of Tony Scott.  A lengthy discussion on Robert Shaw's improvised, possibly intoxicated, monologue in *Jaws* ensues, analyzing his delivery and speculating about the scene's unscripted elements.  Later, the hosts discuss their interns, Rob and Kevi. Kevi is criticized for his lack of initiative and slow work ethic. A caller, Larry, accuses the hosts of mistreating their interns, leading to a heated debate and insults.  The hosts defend their approach, arguing that harsh criticism is necessary for professional development.  Rob is again criticized for his on-air lying.  A commercial break for Steven Singer Jewelers interrupts the argument.  The hosts assign Rob and Kevi rankings ("bottom of the barrel" and potentially "most improved," respectively) and offer advice on self-improvement, including suggestions like bringing treats or arranging a nude appearance by a woman. The show concludes with Opie mentioning an upcoming appearance on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* and a humorous discussion about a listener's peculiar gift: two packs of toilet rim cleaners.  Anthony describes a post-pool-party game of tag in a darkened movie theater involving accidental groping with several women.  The show ends with continued skepticism and disbelief regarding Rob's story surrounding the cancelled pool party.

Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Rules are destroyed.  And convention burns the ground. 
[00:04:30]  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie the Destroyer.  Hey, asshole, just take the joke and take a little beating.  It'll be okay.  Anthony, the Rage.  I feel like dog shit.  If I'm sick, I'm fucking off and my agent has to be called by the rat down the fucking hall.  And Jim Norton, lover of transvestites.  How do you not look at a cock if it's there?  I'm not gay or anything, but for Pete's sake, I'm not rude.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks. 
[00:05:00]  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Well, that's pretty good, huh?  That's a new intro there from Troy Kwan.  It's inaccurate, though.  Pretty funny.  Why is that?  It's very accurate.  To imply that I like transvestites, I don't.  No, no, you don't.  I do not.  No.  My sexual is different.  Exactly.  Tomato, tomato.  Good morning, everyone. 
[00:05:30]  Morning, morning.  Morning.  Uh-oh.  Scoop-a-doo.  Biddly-bee.  Yeah-ya.  Really?  Really?  Look, I saw it.  I don't know why.  I phoned her.  It'd be nice if it was coming in.  Really?  We all said no to that.  What?  I said yes to it, but I didn't know anybody else said no to it.  No, we all said no to that. 
[00:06:00]  I'm cool with it, but, you know.  I thought we said, uh...  That should be a big, huge fucking no.  I thought we said yes to it for someone else.  Is he going to be at a character or in character?  In.  Oh.  Did we for that reason?  That's what the understanding was.  You know what's good about when somebody does a phono when they're in character?  You can hang up at any time, because you're hanging up on the character.  Character?  Yeah.  That should be a big fucking no.  The guy's blown us off forever. 
[00:06:30]  Has he really?  Yes.  I think that's what...  And he came in for, uh, what?  We came in once.  Oh, Borat.  That was a way that we...  And then he marched past our studio to do everything else but us.  That should be a huge fucking no.  I'm serious.  I don't think he ever did everything else but us.  Not, I mean, you know, other shows around here.  No, but I mean, I don't...  Well, basically Howard Show and blew us off.  Shot the Sacha Baron color.  Did he blow the show off?  That should be a huge fucking no for a phoner.  When he was promoting The Dictator, he should have came in here, right? 
[00:07:00]  I think Howard's the only thing he did when he was promoting The Dictator.  Yeah, you know what?  Then fuck him.  Cancel him.  I don't care.  That should be a big no, but whatever.  What?  Whatever.  I saw The Dictator over the weekend.  How was it?  Was it good?  Again.  Another movie.  Another fucking movie that I was sitting there going, there's nothing on.  Let me put this on and get angry.  Right.  And I did find myself chuckling.  Now, as DeRosa will fucking say,  I'm now talking people into seeing this movie.  No. 
[00:07:30]  Make your own decision.  I'm just saying, I did find myself chuckling at a few parts and...  Yeah.  Well, about 50% of the time?  Um, 50% of the jokes, let's say.  Half the time you were laughing?  Which is not half the time of the movie itself.  Right.  But half of the actual times it was supposed to be funny.  Half the times he was looking for laughs, you laughed.  Right.  Is that good or bad?  It's not that good.  Not that good.  But, you know, I'm just kind of hanging.  No, this. 
[00:08:00]  I can't see it.  Sam's over there relaxing.  Oh.  Was that what was supposed to happen?  I completely forgot, but yeah.  Oh.  I say no to the fucking guy, to be honest with you.  These guys just forget.  They just forget who, you know, who's around and real supportive and...  Yeah.  It's up to you guys.  No, I don't care that much.  It would have been...  We could have had fun with it,  but if he's blowing the show off and not come in on purpose... 
[00:08:30]  Of course he has.  Then fuck him.  Cancel him.  Yeah, it's...  I'm okay with that.  Yeah, fuck him.  Bye-bye.  We're busy.  Yeah.  Tell him we're busy.  That means Roland's day is going to be a little stressful now.  No, but you know what?  You're right.  Because literally there was times where he could have come in and he didn't.  I can say my attention for the passion.  But no.  My Roland.  All right.  He's going to be...  That was another thing that happened with Roland over the weekend,  where you and Roland and...  The Machine. 
[00:09:00]  Burt?  Burt Kreischer?  And then I guess on stage...  Where were you guys?  At Levity Live in the Palisades.  Of course.  It's the guys that own Gotham here in New York.  They got a club up north.  Yeah, and I guess you guys are on stage.  You're hanging out.  You're having a little fun.  And somebody said,  Hey, tweet this.  This is Anthony on stage with The Machine, with Burt and Sam.  And he's doing shots.  And it was actually Roland with a baseball hat on without a shirt.  Right.  And Roland has lost a lot of weight, but he's still kind of rotund. 
[00:09:30]  Sure.  And then people were starting to tweet us.  I'm like, what the fuck is this?  What's this about?  And people were like, here's another one, another one, another one.  So then I just started looking at their profile pics and picking out little things about them  and throwing it on.  I wasn't blocking people.  And then other people were like, take a joke, pussy.  What a douche chill you are.  It's like, don't you understand?  Take a joke.  I'm joking.  Yeah.  I'm fucking making the joke.  People on Twitter are fucking retarded.  They're dumb.  They're 90% of everyone on Twitter are idiots. 
[00:10:00]  They don't get anything.  They don't understand a joke.  And they're just fucking morons.  So I wasn't blocking people.  I said, you know, blocked by this.  But I wasn't really blocking them.  I understood when you, I understood people didn't think Roland was me.  I thought you were kidding, especially when somebody said, Jesus, take a joke.  And you responded with, why don't you take a dick?  Yeah.  Why don't you take a dick?  I was like, okay.  Yes, I did. 
[00:10:30]  Good old Bert.  Yeah.  He brought us up on stage.  And then he had Roland do a shot of tequila with him.  Oh, really?  And had Roland take his shirt off and then told everybody in the audience to tweet.  That Anthony Cumia was on stage with him.  Right.  Just so everybody was just like, what the fuck is happening?  Does he actually tell jokes while he's up there?  Yeah, he's actually really.  Or does he throw a fraternity party?  He's actually really funny.  Yeah, Bert's funny.  I was surprised.  I didn't really know what to expect.  What was that?  Was that his encore?  No, it was just like, he was kind of drunk by the end of it. 
[00:11:00]  Because it was the late show on a Saturday.  And he'd been drinking the whole time.  Yeah.  So he decided to have a little fun with the audience?  Yeah.  And so he knew Roland and me were there.  Actually, I know he's funny.  How's the club?  It's really nice.  Cool.  Ooh.  Where is it?  It's in the Palisades.  Is that up where you live or something?  It's right by, I mean, technically it's Rockland County, but it's right by Westchester.  You've got to take the bridge, don't you?  Tap and Z.  You've got to take the tap.  I almost took the tap and Z over the weekend.  Oh, shit.  Oh.  Oh, almost.  Nice young lady up there. 
[00:11:30]  Came real close.  Well, not...  There's no other reason for you to take the tap.  Not quite.  Well, there was one reason where I might have taken the tap and Z.  And it wasn't for a young lady?  Not technically.  It was for a young gentleman.  Uh-oh.  Jesus.  Breaking news.  Our own intern Rob.  This is news to him, by the way, because when I was texting him trying to get his address,  and yesterday he was in here for the Sunday show and said, were you really going to come?  I said, well, somebody else was asking.  And he goes, who?  I go, you'll find out tomorrow. 
[00:12:00]  Wait, but you almost went?  What happened?  You're talking about intern Rob's pool party.  Yes, intern Rob's pool party.  He brought in the handwritten...  That was his past weekend?  Yeah.  It was Saturday.  He wrote his handwritten invitations with the time and date and place and everything else in crayon  and clipped the edges to make it fringy and everything.  And, um, I, of course, didn't have the invitation.  That was another bone of contention.  We left him here and there might have been some hurt feelings.  Where'd you put it?  I put it in the garbage.  Oh.  Uh, yeah, Opie ripped his in half. 
[00:12:30]  What?  I did?  And, uh, Jimmy just left his here on the console, like, so many scummy tissues.  And, um, so I found myself in the city, uh, Saturday morning.  And I was like, hey, you know, it's not that far.  Why don't I go with a guest?  Why don't I go to Rob's party?  It's a pool party.  There's beers there.  Barbecue.  A pool.  Like, what the fuck?  So, uh, I'm like, I threw the invitation away.  I need to get the address. 
[00:13:00]  So let me just call, uh, text Sam and E-Rock and whatnot.  They gotta be able to come up with the address.  So I get Sam and Sam's like, I'm trying.  I'm DMing the guy.  I'm trying to get a message here.  I can't get a message.  So I'm just sitting now in my apartment, waiting, like a fucking wallflower, like a motherfucking stood-up bitch.  I'm sitting in my apartment, waiting for a response with the address so I could finally leave and head up to his party, uh, in Jersey.  And this is all to go to some intern's pool party. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  Like, like, if it was the easiest thing to do, then I'll do it.  And it was.  I was in Manhattan.  I'm like, what the fuck?  It's not as far as if I was still out on Long Island.  Let me, let me try to make the effort and, you know, make the kids day.  Uh, so yeah, exactly.  Drink his beer.  Uh, and, and then finally, after probably 45 minutes or so, I get a text from, uh, the wonderful Sam Roberts who says, oh, he postponed it because of the weather.  And, and I was, it was a beautiful day. 
[00:14:00]  It was, yeah.  Beautiful day.  It was like a perfect summer day.  And if there's any questions.  Humidity?  Maybe it was, you know, not as nice by him.  Right.  The mall that I was at where I was seeing Bert was the same day, the same night, right by his house.  That means.  Maybe five minutes away and the weather was beautiful.  That means his RSVPs were down.  Yes.  Something else happened.  He was like, oh, no one's coming to my party.  You think none of the girls responded?  None of the chicks were coming.  She doesn't really know those girls.  Those chicks that was supposed to come.  He knows them on Facebook.  That's about it.  They're not real friends. 
[00:14:30]  They're some of those fake friends.  But he almost had Anthony at his party.  That was a one-shot deal.  Like, the stars lined up.  It was all ready to go.  And now, I wouldn't fucking go to his party.  Where is he?  When is he going to do it?  When's the rescheduled party?  The rescheduled party, yeah.  That I hope like three fucking people go to.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, now he has baked goods.  He's got more goodies.  Oh, God.  He's trying to make goods.  Oh, Rob.  Oh, good.  Why do you got baked goods in there? 
[00:15:00]  Yay, for baked goods.  Are they baked goods or is it chicken cutlets or something?  Oh, wait.  You missed the baked goods last time?  Yes.  Oh, they were really good.  His mom does make way better fucking baked goods than Sam's mom.  Oh, good.  It's pretty fucking good, I got to say.  Yeah, what do you got there, Rob?  Well, my mom made cookies for the party.  What kind?  Chocolate chip.  What's that?  For the party, that's...  Oh, yeah.  Look how perfect the tinfoil is.  Look at it.  It has doilies.  By the way, I was playing Amy Schumer yesterday.  I was telling her about your dislike of a certain intern where you went up throwing a strawberry 
[00:15:30]  on a shoe.  Oh, yes.  And I showed her the fucking music video and she was fucking revolted.  But she howled.  Yeah, she was enjoying it.  What is that?  That one was justified, I must say.  Same cookies as last time.  Are those magic?  The other ones?  Magic.  I don't like the magic cookie bars.  Try a magic cookie bar, Jim.  I don't like the magic cookie bars.  I can't, I gotta do something wrong.  Yeah.  What?  I gotta look good for tomorrow and then Wednesday I can have a magic cookie bar.  You always look good.  Oh.  Attaboy, Rob.  Wow.  Just try a magic cookie bar, please.  Magic.  Just take a bite out of the magic cookie bar. 
[00:16:00]  All right, I'll have a bite.  It is very magical.  I just don't like the presentation.  Everything's just perfect about this family.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you're aware now.  Except, of course, they're party planning.  What happened to your pool party that Anthony was going to go to?  What happened?  I did.  I know.  Wow.  I'm so mad.  What happened?  I was sitting like a fucking piece of shit waiting for your address and I'm sitting in  the city like, oh, what do I do?  Now I start feeling silly.  It was like, it was not good weather by me in the morning. 
[00:16:30]  In the morning?  What time is this party?  9 a.m.?  No.  It was fucking by noon.  It was beautiful.  I didn't know because I checked the weather and everything like that and it always, it  just said it's not going to be good.  It said rainy and stuff like that.  I don't know.  That means you hang out with really boring people.  Because if you had like a cool bunch of friends and stuff, who gives a fuck if it's  raining a little bit?  And it wasn't even raining.  It's a pool party.  Everyone's going to get wet anyway.  Yeah.  Don't you have like some kind of coverage?  Can't they go inside in between dipping in the pool?  And how, by the way, did you get the word out to everybody that there wasn't going to  be a party? 
[00:17:00]  Through Facebook, pretty much.  Oh, yeah?  Was there something on Facebook?  I didn't get anything.  I missed that.  Something smells very fishy about this kid.  Oh, private message.  I didn't get any private message.  You knew there was a chance.  Because...  We never said we weren't showing up.  We said, eh, we'll play it by ear.  But then you cancel the party and then don't even give us the common courtesy.  I'm sorry.  And you were waiting for like an hour, just sitting there like a schlub.  Sitting like a schlub.  Oh, I hope I get invited.  Like a mook.  Like a schnook. 
[00:17:30]  Wait, so you private message people on Facebook?  Yeah.  Why not just post it?  Yeah, something's very fishy.  Something's wrong.  Thank you, Jordan.  We've been around a long time, Rob.  No, it's fine.  What's up with this kid?  I'm thinking chicks fell through.  You felt a little silly having a fucking sausage party.  And that's what happened, right?  A lot of people backed out, but it was also the weather and stuff.  There were like 10 people coming and stuff.  What's up with this kid?  I'm getting creeped out.  I don't know.  I got my radar zone. 
[00:18:00]  Could you imagine if I showed up and there's like three people milling around?  Dude, there's something about this kid that creeps me out.  Yeah?  Why would a lot of people just cancel that?  It wasn't like cancel.  So it was just like, there were like 10, 12 people coming, and then I canceled it.  I invited like 30 people.  Oh, man.  Because it's like school.  Oh, am I glad I didn't fucking go?  Wow.  Wait a minute.  You invited 30 people.  12 said maybe. 
[00:18:30]  How many were actually coming to your awful birthday party?  Like 12 were going to come and stuff.  Is that including me?  I think you get the illusion that you're a cool kid, but I don't think you're a cool kid.  Something is wrong here.  I think Ovi's got a point.  Something is wrong here.  He does give this impression of a very cool guy.  He's fucking big man on campus.  I shove a lot of fingers up girls' assholes.  That was my first suspicion.  And the fact of the matter is, a lot of World of Warcraft in a dark room.  Yeah, what's up with you, Rob?  Were you afraid that girl was going to show up and then Ant was going to try to bang her  or something or that she wasn't going to show up? 
[00:19:00]  Tell the truth.  What were you afraid of?  No, nothing.  I wasn't afraid of anything.  Cover your mother's cookies.  I'm sorry.  All right.  What were you afraid of?  You can't plan this pool party for weeks and then cancel the last minute.  That doesn't sound like something is not right.  That's right.  I don't know.  What is it, Rob?  Tell us, Rob.  Nothing, really.  It was nothing.  I don't know.  It was just the weather.  He didn't have the turnout he thought he was going to have.  Yeah.  30 people.  That kind of ruined it.  But he said a lot of people canceled.  Yeah.  A lot of people don't cancel stuff.  A lot of people weren't going to come.  Okay.  For what reason? 
[00:19:30]  I don't know.  Just schools, going back to school and everything like that.  Going back to school.  It's like August.  You're looking to party your ass off before, you know, you're trying to have that last  blast before a fucking school starts.  I can understand maybe this week people start going back to college a little early, but  not last week.  Not Saturday.  Damn, man.  That would be the last hurrah.  Did you think Anthony was going to go?  No, I had no clue.  I was, obviously you had no clue, sir.  And those were the cookies that were made for the party?  Oh, man.  Yeah, my mom made them.  Cookies.  What did you do with all the party stuff? 
[00:20:00]  What about all the beer?  It's just in my basement.  Oh.  Oh, is it?  And what about like the barbecue stuff?  It's in the fridge, you know?  Yeah.  For 30 people, what are you going to do with it?  That's so much meat.  That's fine.  Jesus, I hope he's calling him a fucking liar.  You're a fucking liar.  Look, there's things I'm really good at, and this is one of them.  I smell shit.  You smell a rat?  It's not even a rat.  There's something different here.  There's something not right.  What are you not saying, Rob? 
[00:20:30]  You might as well.  Something is not right.  It's a tough room to bullshit in.  You probably didn't buy all that stuff, knowing that the party was going to be a bust, but  now you're saying the stuff was all bought, and it's just sitting in your house.  Yeah, I had beer.  How much beer?  Six pack.  I had like two 30s, three 30s.  But see the long pause?  Does anyone...  And two or three 30s.  Does anyone know this game?  I had beer from before, and then I bought more beer. 
[00:21:00]  It wasn't like...  Why buy more beer if no one was coming?  Oh.  Because I didn't know.  Why'd you get 90 cans of beer for 12 people?  What kind of food is in the fridge?  Yes.  Hot dogs and hamburgers.  So much beer.  What else?  How many hot dogs?  How many hamburgers?  Um...  This is...  I don't know.  I didn't...  You didn't have any chicken?  Because I didn't...  Because his parents do it all.  I don't like chicken.  They all do it.  Mother and father were throwing the party.  Yeah.  Mother and father.  Don't let them off the hook, man.  We're throwing them off a little party.  We know there's something wrong.  This is an eyepatch situation. 
[00:21:30]  I'm telling you.  Oh, man.  I don't know what it is yet, but I'll get to the bottom of it.  I was suspicious of this kid when he said he shoved fingers up a girl's asshole.  That turned out to be a lie.  Most girls can barely take a fucking thumb, and this kid's shoving fingers up, uh...  Fingers up girls' assholes.  I'm from the school of thought that there's...  It's nothing so notorious or covert as much as it is, he just isn't that cool a guy.  I'm thinking, like, you know, you throw a party, eh, not a lot of people want to show up. 
[00:22:00]  I feel bad.  He's not getting the girls.  Oh, the girl.  How many of the girls?  Out of those 10, 12 people you're talking about?  Probably 10.  How many girls were going to be there?  It was about even.  No way, Jose.  Swear.  I don't even want to talk to him.  He swears, Opie.  I don't even want to talk to him.  He swears.  I know.  That's a big tell, too, when you say something like, I swear.  Boy, your approval rating was so high, and then, like, toward the end of his internship,  it's like, oh, it's starting to go down. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, his approval rating.  I don't know what it is.  Maybe the listeners could help.  But something is not right here.  Yeah, what is it?  Tell him.  Something is really not right.  Maybe you don't know those people on Facebook, really, or something.  Yeah.  Or your friends are very nerdy.  Or you don't have a lot of friends.  Or you've been touched as a child.  Or he told his family he was in better standing with the show than he is, and he was afraid  that, like, everyone from the people from the show being there, he's afraid of mixing  these worlds, I think. 
[00:23:00]  Or maybe he planned on having a party, like, just for the guys on the show, and he thought  that, like, everybody was going to show up.  Oh.  And then he realized nobody was going to, and so...  Let's start with this.  There's no beer in your house, is there?  No, there is.  90 cans.  He paused, though.  The long pause, and then said, I don't know, 230s or...  330s.  330s.  330s.  I don't know.  Hot dogs, hamburgers.  What are the sides?  What are the sides for the barbecue?  Well, my mom was going to make pasta salad.  Oh.  Yes.  Which is delicious. 
[00:23:30]  And then, you know, like, salads and stuff like that.  The cookies.  Cookies.  What else?  Um, I don't know.  We were just kind of going to wing it.  And what do you have planned?  Are you going to, like, blast some music and shit?  Yeah.  What did you get for the non-drinkers?  Oh, there was soda.  Oh.  What type of soda?  Like, Coke.  Spray.  It's all, like...  Like, I mean, but, like, what type of soda?  Did you buy the soda?  I love this interrogation.  But did you buy the soda? 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  How much soda did you buy?  Uh, five, five, two-liter bottles.  Ten liters.  Yeah.  Good math.  I want a liter of cola.  What's this about?  I don't know, but it's also, like...  It smells...  It's fishy, right?  90 cans of beer versus that many cookies.  There's so much more beer than cookies.  Well, there's more cookies at home.  There's a food-to-beverage disparity.  Oh, it doesn't make any sense.  There's more cookies at home.  There's more cookies at home.  I mean, it's not like I'm going to bring... 
[00:24:30]  How many cookies do you want to bake?  I don't know.  I think that's plenty of cookies for a pool party.  And why would you get 30...  Three 30-packs for a confirmed 10 guests?  I don't know.  Just like that fun.  Oh.  Just like that fun.  They want to know...  Some people want to know if you cancel the ball pit and jumping castle.  I don't know if we're going to get to the bottom of this, but something's not right.  I don't either.  With this kid.  What are you not feeling?  What do you think is something, right? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  I think...  I don't know.  I don't think he really knows anyone, to be honest with you.  Oh, man.  Like he just stays at home with his parents and hangs out with his brother all the time?  What do you think, Sam?  And then has imaginary Facebook friends that he shoves fingers up there.  Oh, those hot girls were just non-existent.  Now, do you think...  God, that's why...  When you said...  How do you let people know when you said Facebook?  And then...  You wouldn't private message people.  Yeah, nobody would private message.  It was like an event.  It was...  No, but it's a pool party.  So your Facebook page... 
[00:25:30]  Sorry, guys.  I'm going to cancel the fucking pool party.  All right, can we see...  And then maybe your private message as well.  How about this?  I'm sure he's telling the truth.  How about...  Can we see one of the...  One of the...  Private messages?  Yeah.  No, because it's like the event.  And once you cancel the event, it's like gone.  I swear.  It really is.  But what about the private messages?  Yeah.  No, it wasn't like...  It was the event.  Like event page.  You know how if you make an event...  Yeah.  And then you put like private...  All right, call one fucking person.  No one's going to be up at 6.30. 
[00:26:00]  See?  Well, I mean...  See what I'm saying?  Does anyone else see this?  Fucking one person.  All you need is one person to back you up today.  All right.  I'll call at 9.30.  How's that sound?  That's plenty of time to get...  Because no one's up now.  It's 6.30 in the morning.  Because that's how long it's going to take to start texting people like, I need a favor,  man.  Is there any...  Call someone right the fuck now.  Any record...  All right, here.  Is there any record that this party would have existed, was planned to exist, or anything, 
[00:26:30]  aside from the invitations, handwritten invites that you threw...  Well, we may have...  This party does not exist.  It will not exist.  It's like Colonel Kurtz's assassination.  Are you a serial killer, and you were just trying to get one of us over to your house  to be your latest trophy?  Tied up in the basement.  Damn.  But he invited 10 people from this building.  Yeah.  That's 10 people that didn't RSVP, meaning we might show up, but we might not.  So how did you tell the people around here? 
[00:27:00]  Sorry.  Well, you didn't.  How, Rob?  How did you tell the people around here?  I didn't get noticed.  You just wanted people to show up at your house?  No, I said the...  I had the invitations.  I mean, what about canceling it?  Yeah, thank you.  Oh, well, Sam...  Well, everyone pretty much told me they weren't going to come already.  So when we go through Sam...  Besides...  No...  I'll give them that point.  Everyone told me...  But Sam, wasn't there people around here that did say they would go?  Yeah, well, there was a lot of unconfirmed.  Like, oh, do you think anybody's going to show up?  I believe I did say...  Look, I'm not saying I'm not going. 
[00:27:30]  I, you know...  I plan on going, but I want to have something booked last minute.  I plan on going.  So you didn't tell one person around here that the party was canceled?  No, I didn't.  And Jim is telling the truth.  I had a date for the party and everything.  Jim is telling the truth, because after Ant texted me saying, can I get his address,  Jim texted me saying, how did the pool party end up turning out?  I feel like a dick now.  Oh, man.  No, something's wrong.  Something's wrong.  What happened here?  I mean, if you're inviting everyone from the place you're interning at, you've got to  get the word out to those people. 
[00:28:00]  Plus, not only did he not get the word out, but as Anthony had to find out the hard way,  he wasn't even...  He was incommunicado.  Yeah, yeah.  He wasn't even easily available to tell people.  And here's another thing.  Let's say, for the sake of argument...  Wait, so I'm just waking up finally.  Yeah.  Sorry.  So when you wanted to go to his party, you texted Sam or E-Rock?  To get the address.  And then E-Rock, as much as we beat the shit out of him, he gets shit done like that.  E-Rock wasn't readily available. 
[00:28:30]  I don't know what he was doing.  It took him a while to get in touch with me.  He's got to throw back to me.  How long after fucking...  How long?  It was a long time.  2.47.  I had family over, so...  And when I got your text, I saw your text, I contacted him, and he told me,  Oh, the party's canceled.  It's raining.  I said, I'm like 15 minutes from you.  It's fine.  I'm having my party.  Oh, see?  And he said, no.  So you had your party.  Yeah, I had mine.  Which Eric didn't invite any of us.  And then I wrote back to you, and I said, he postponed it due to the rain, and you're 
[00:29:00]  laughing.  You go, it's fucking nice out.  It's beautiful out everywhere.  Can you check the weather for Saturday?  Yeah.  Check what the weather was.  Also...  Something's up with this kid.  I don't know what it is.  It's driving me nuts.  Imagine if I didn't throw the invitation away, and had taken it home, and knew your address.  Dude, I would have driven to your house with no party.  I would have just pulled up and been like, what the fuck is going on?  And you go, oh, yeah, dude, I had it canceled.  I'd been like, what the fuck?  Imagine if that would have happened.  I'm sorry.  Well, you didn't make any effort to let anybody know that there was no party. 
[00:29:30]  Lack of effort.  I messed up.  Man.  I should have just had it.  I'm sorry.  You should have just had it.  I don't know where to go for previous weather.  For previous weather.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just Google it.  Yeah.  Shouldn't you be able to do Google?  Shouldn't you just put the date in and weather for, and then you just put that date in?  Yeah, I did.  Oh, boy.  Go to weather.com.  Let's start there.  There's not like a back button.  Back button on weather.  Yeah, for yesterday, two days ago. 
[00:30:00]  Jimmy, what do you think about this kid?  Something's not right here.  I think that I don't like the fact that everything is just untraceable, and I don't like the fact  that he didn't tell anybody here.  Yeah.  But there was no party.  I don't buy that.  I have trouble believing that.  Don't get nervous.  How many people knew about the party around here, Sam?  At least ten.  And not one of them heard that the party was canceled?  No, not one.  Not one.  Because everyone said, what is going on here?  Everyone said, I'm not going to come.  Who said they're not going to come? 
[00:30:30]  No, we did.  Eric.  Sam.  But I didn't confirm I wasn't coming.  You never said I wasn't coming.  You did.  I said, I don't think anybody's going to your party.  I didn't say, I am not coming.  And I think, I went away for a few days, but I think there was a discussion that there  was a possibility that some or all of us, meaning me and Jim, could possibly show up.  And on Friday.  There was a discussion.  It wasn't a definite, fuck, no, I'm not going.  It was brought up on Thursday or Friday, too.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  What is this? 
[00:31:00]  It's weird.  Rob, what's up with you, man?  Were you embarrassed that nobody was coming to your family?  What were you embarrassed about?  There was something embarrassing.  You didn't just cancel it.  Nonchalant.  Is one of your parents an embarrassment and they were acting up and you had a canceled  every day?  Well, my parents are kind of a little bit of an embarrassment, but like.  What were they doing that was?  No, they weren't.  It wasn't like they were doing anything.  It's just they're always, you know.  My dad's very hands-on and stuff like that.  Oh, no.  Right.  So that's why the girls didn't want to show.  Do they hit you?  Oh, no.  Do they hit you when you're not here? 
[00:31:30]  No, they don't.  It was just, I don't know, when no one wanted to come from here.  I was a little bit embarrassing, but I was still going to have some friends and stuff.  Oh, man.  I wanted to come from here.  It's crazy.  You got the weather for this past Saturday?  Yeah.  Right.  Let's see.  All right.  Let's see.  Let's see what the weather.  And how did you check the weather, Rob?  Oh.  Weather.com.  But looking outside, everyone was saying it looked pretty good.  It was.  Nobody else.  Well, I was outside, and it was like 10, 10.30 in the morning. 
[00:32:00]  Am I dreaming it was Saturday pretty fucking nice, Alex?  Yeah, it turned nice.  Wait.  I was driving home.  I know.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm a witness.  Saturday, I drove from, we ended up in Cape May for a couple hours.  So I went from Cape May all the way to Manhattan.  And now that I think about it, I didn't see one fucking cloud in the sky.  Beautiful.  And I drove the entire state of Jersey, basically.  Beautiful day.  Iraq, it was thundering and raining up until about 9 a.m. 
[00:32:30]  And then...  Oh, that is tough.  Yeah, 9 a.m., though.  That was true.  When I woke up, it was pouring.  Right.  But that all cleared the fuck out.  Let me tell you what my plan B was that I did.  What?  My house, my fucking pool, my barbecue.  Didn't you get wet?  And fucking great, sunny, beautiful day.  I'm sorry.  You didn't get rain on you?  Not a fucking drop of rain.  Lightning?  No.  What was the weather like there, Sam, for the rest of the day?  It was beautiful.  Yeah, a little. 
[00:33:00]  Max temperature at 82?  I mean, it sounds like perfect pool party weather.  Yeah, it is.  Average humidity, 70?  But he cancels it, but he doesn't tell you when he's canceling it, except for a private  message on the event page on Facebook.  That's what's weird.  Which none of us got.  I am so glad.  That no one here got.  Because he assumed none of us were going.  See, no.  Yeah.  But I need to know what this is about.  If I was going to go, I literally, I landed something that I had to do that day. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  That was what I was doing, was going to this dumb pool party.  I had to fucking, first, and here's another thing.  I would have had to have left my firearm in my apartment in Manhattan because I'm not  allowed to have it in Jersey.  Really?  You know how many times I do that?  None.  Wow.  I'm paranoid like a crazy person without it.  But I was ready, ready, willing, and able.  Ready, reeling, and able.  Ready, reeling, and able.  If you came, you could have had one of my mom's guns. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, righty.  That's nice.  But apparently there was no party.  I know.  I would have been there alone.  I'd been looking for the house going like, this is fucked up because this can't be the  house because there's no cars here.  It would have been you, your guest, and Rob.  Oh, man.  And the parents.  Do you think anybody else was invited to the party?  I'm pretty sure.  My, after this conversation, I don't think anybody else was ever invited.  Did you draw 30 invitations?  No.  How many did you draw?  Just you guys.  Just here. 
[00:34:30]  Can we see another invitation?  I didn't draw.  Were you using our celebrity status to get other people to the pool party, and then when  you realized we weren't going, that fucked up your whole plan?  Yeah, were you saying, come to the Opie and Anthony pool party?  No.  Fucking Conway Tweety with a K. I'm getting a catfish movie vibe from this intern.  Oh, man.  Right?  Yeah.  Something's gone on.  But he's really creeping me out because he's put together well.  He's a good looking kid.  He seems like comes from my-  Handsome Rob.  Handsome Rob. 
[00:35:00]  It seems like he's got good parents and all, so this is really fucking weird.  Yeah, it's weird.  This is a weird one, man.  I'll get to the bottom of you.  I'm good at this shit.  Patrick Bateman.  Yeah.  Something's up.  You've got good parents.  Not too bad of a brain.  Can we call your parents right now?  Right now?  They're not going to be up.  Wake them up.  See, there's all this-  I know.  We can't get a hold of anyone.  China.  And he's good at lying.  Nothing is-  You're like a pathological liar.  I'm getting a Casey Anthony vibe from you talking.  Nothing is good.  Nothing is traceable. 
[00:35:30]  You're right.  There's a pathological lying thing happening here, too.  That's right.  Oh, man.  Are you pathologically lying?  Rob, I know-  Are you pathologically lying?  Do you understand?  The one thing I do know is I know crazy.  Yeah?  Something's up with you.  What pill are you on?  Are you on a pill?  No, I'm not.  No.  I don't do drugs.  No medications?  Nope.  No legal medications?  Nope.  I mean, we got past the web feed, so that's not an issue.  His parents obviously have a house phone.  I know.  I know.  They would not sleep through the phone right now. 
[00:36:00]  I'd rather figure it out myself.  I don't want to call her.  There is no pool party to be had, guys.  I'm telling you.  Do you think there's a pool?  There's no even record of a Facebook invite or something?  Because, look, if you make-  Didn't some people write you back and go, oh, that sucks because I was planning on going  to your pool party.  If you make an event, somebody must have written you back.  Cancel it.  What about the event?  What about your friends?  Like, wouldn't your friends have just tagged on your Facebook?  Like, oh, where were you?  Have gone to your party.  Yeah.  Hey, yay.  Wouldn't something make your Facebook wall? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Any evidence on my fucking party?  Like, hey, Rob, fuck, that sucks.  I got your private fucking event.  There's nothing going to be there.  There's nothing on your wall?  No, there's no wall.  I don't really use Facebook now.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  But wait, you don't use Facebook.  You were showing us Facebook girls.  Because it's a lot easier for, like, events and stuff.  Right.  But somebody must-  If you plan-  I can see that.  But if you say, I'm going to do this thing, an event, somebody wrote you back and go,  hey, man, I can't make it, or I will be there.  But it'd be like a phone call.  It wouldn't really be-  Oh, no.  A phone call. 
[00:37:00]  Wait, someone would see it on Facebook and not write-  And call you.  And they get their phone and call you?  By the way.  What 21-year-old in 2012 calls?  No one.  No one.  I call all the time.  You have no texts?  Do you have a text on your phone from somebody going, uh, party's canceled?  I delete my text messages.  Oh, my God!  I've creeped out.  Who deletes text messages?  No one!  I do.  I have texts from fucking years ago.  Rob, I'm an old fuck at this point.  I know this shit.  So why don't you come clean?  What is going on, man? 
[00:37:30]  Come clean.  Nothing's going on.  You're, you're, you're, no, you don't delete texts.  Well, you deleted the text messages from people saying-  This is a complete wipeout of any information whatsoever on the, on the realm of a conspiracy.  That's right.  In this day and age, it would be so easy to prove that you canceled a pool party.  It's harder to wipe out all that digital info than it is to keep it.  Between text messages, Facebook, Twitter maybe.  I don't know how much you use Twitter.  We can't get a hold of any of your friends because it's too early.  Who gives a fuck if we wake them up?  Yeah, who cares? 
[00:38:00]  I said I'd call them.  And how did one person not respond to you via textbook email?  Like, like, I'm sorry, uh, Facebook email.  Is there even a pool?  Yes.  Oh, man.  I'll show you, you want a picture of the pool?  No.  No, you can have a picture of a pool.  Exactly.  See, and also you're saying you, you can call them later when they wake up.  That gives you time to fucking call someone, get the story straight and have them call.  You can take my phone and just leave it in here.  There's plenty of other ways to communicate.  Hey, we got, you know, a guy named Mike in Jersey?  Mike!  Mike got a DM.  Uh, Mike, you got a DM from Rob? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He told me all the anal lube was out, so we couldn't all see.  Uh, all the anal lube was out?  The anal lube.  That's not true.  The anal lube.  The anal lube.  How much anal lube did you get for the party knowing that you love sticking fingers up a girl's asshole?  Two knuckles in, right?  Oh, boy.  Did he say two knuckles in, too?  He went...  With fingers.  When questioned on it, he then found...  He did admit that he was lying about that and it was just one finger, but then he went  back and said he got it two knuckles in before she told him to get it out of there. 
[00:39:00]  I wish we could find a whore.  I wish we could find a whore and see how Rob gets two fingers in a girl's asshole.  Two fingers, two digits.  It is possible, but I would love to see how he fucking maneuvers that shit.  No party.  But nobody was even, like, none of his friends from school were like, hey, douche, it's sunny  out.  I can't believe you canceled the party and just left it on his wall.  Like, just because it was a Facebook event page doesn't mean that communication is exclusively  in that...  Right.  His face is starting to break down.  This is good.  We almost got him. 
[00:39:30]  It's getting weird.  It's getting weirder, by the way.  It is weird, right?  So, Rob, what is it?  You've got to tell us, because there is no traceable evidence.  Nothing.  Like, I don't...  That's what's hard to believe.  I made an event page.  Sure.  Invited people.  People were going to come.  You invited the people here, which is kind of important right now, because you're interning  here, and hoping maybe they'll hire you, and then you don't tell anyone you invited here  that the party's canceled?  How did you invite everybody else here without drawing those invitations you drew for us? 
[00:40:00]  No, I did draw all those invitations for everyone else.  For everyone here?  So you drew ten of them?  Yes.  Wait, he said he...  Only for people here?  No, but he said he only drew...  Only drew for us earlier.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No.  Whether he did or not, that's us.  Find it, Iraq.  If he can.  He said he only fucking made the invitation.  You tripped up there a little bit.  You fucked up.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, no.  Sam's is on his desk.  But you said you only made it for us.  And you pointed at me, Jimmy's is on his desk.  Oh, no.  I didn't mean that. 
[00:40:30]  Well, then what do you mean by it?  It meant, like, here.  Like, us.  It's, like, everyone who works for the staff.  You're not part of us.  What time...  I know.  ...did you cancel the event?  Ah, good question.  Around 11.  11.  And so when you canceled the event at 11, it what?  Disappeared?  Yeah.  And everybody who...  All 12 people who were going to go to the event saw it on Facebook.  Yeah.  And there was not one email, not one text, and not one just message to you on Facebook.  You intuitively knew that everybody saw it. 
[00:41:00]  They saw it.  And no one showed up at your house.  Not one person called to be like, you canceled the party?  Look, I have no doubt he's lying.  I just don't know what this is about.  And that's what's really creeping me out.  No one showed up at your house for this party.  No.  And no one's asking you.  No one, inadvertently.  Everyone.  No.  30 people, regardless of who was going to show up or not, 30 people got an invite.  There's always one that it doesn't get to.  Always.  Always.  Always.  Everyone got the message that there is no party.  Yeah.  Although I didn't get it, and I literally had people working to try to find out where 
[00:41:30]  this party is and what's happening, yet I didn't get it, and I was...  I didn't just, like other party guests, stumble upon your Facebook.  I didn't get it either.  I'm sorry.  And you were going to go.  Did you text people?  I messed up.  No.  Oh.  Did you tweet it?  No.  Why wouldn't you tweet it?  I did tweet it afterwards.  I said the party's canceled.  Did people text you?  What time did you tweet the party's canceled?  Like, after I got all the phone calls from you guys.  What time? 
[00:42:00]  I think it was like two...  Phone call calls from who?  Phone call calls from who?  From Eric, and then Sam was direct messaging me.  But that's not a...  That's the after...  And did you text people?  No.  Did they text you?  No, they called.  Holy fuck, you already said they texted you, and you fucking deleted the text messages.  You did say you deleted the text messages.  Oh, man.  Another slip-up.  Oh, no.  You slipped up again.  What's your Twitter?  Robert Bobbert 05.  What is it?  Jesus.  R-O-B-E-R-T.  It's like first 48. 
[00:42:30]  B-O-B-E-R-T.  Only, you know, white.  Hugh Normia.  His lying is so uncomfortable, I can't listen.  Wow.  People are really uncomfortable.  Anal Trainer 610 says, two knuckles is pretty easy with the right technique.  For a 21-year-old, not likely.  Damn.  Oh, that's the cowboy hat.  You did?  Oh, my God.  Rob, you said that people texted you, and that you deleted their text.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, no. 
[00:43:00]  Please.  And how do you not...  If you cancel a party day of, how do you not text everybody?  Everyone to make sure...  You'd be scurrying.  You'd be so freaked out.  Because I said...  It's like, ah, I gotta tell everyone.  Holy shit, it's last minute.  Because I said...  Can you write down your address right now, please?  So Troy Kwan had tweeted him.  Seriously, write down your address.  Just write it down.  He wrote down this.  Rob did tweet at 1240...  At 1240...  No, it was later than that.  It was...  Oh, no, it was 245. 
[00:43:30]  245.  He tweeted that very quickly after he direct messaged me back.  So almost four hours after you cancel the party,  you decide to then tweet the cancel agent.  Right, why wouldn't you Twitter that?  Only after these guys were on to you and started saying,  you know, where's the party?  Google map that shit.  I want to...  Google Earth.  I want to see if he even has a fucking pool.  I'll bet he has a pool, but there's something...  You're right.  There is something weird going on here.  And I don't know what it is either.  It's all right. 
[00:44:00]  So wait, what had you been tweeting earlier that day?  I don't think anything.  That was your first tweet.  First tweet after it's like,  uh-oh, I better cover my ass because...  Right.  He probably forgot that he had a fake pool party.  Yeah, yeah, the fake pool party.  For whatever reason, he's throwing a fake pool party.  Why wouldn't you tweet that or put a message...  You don't just delete the event and all of a sudden people know.  That doesn't make...  That doesn't make sense.  That doesn't make sense.  Because if you delete the event,  how do people know it's canceled? 
[00:44:30]  Wouldn't they go there and be like,  Oh, I don't even see.  Jesus.  Oh, wow.  You got a really nice house.  Two driveways.  Wow, what the fuck.  Big nice pool.  That is a nice big pool.  So what was the issue here?  Nothing.  There was no issue.  That's a really nice pool and a really nice house.  Unless he's talented Mr. Ripley-ing us,  and this is all his friend's life that he's been doing his entire internship.  Oh, thanks for the spoiler.  But then he tricks us with the magic cookies.  Where would I have pulled up alone in front of that house?  Would I have gone in the driveway?  Yeah, you could have gone in the driveway. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, cool.  Yeah, by the way, visible from this is all the guests at the pool party.  Oh, there's no one there.  See?  Was that picture taken Saturday?  I don't even have a white car.  What?  Whose car is that?  I don't know.  Oh, really?  You might want to check on the white car.  Absolutely.  What time of day was this?  When father's out working.  Right.  I mean, this isn't from like...  An official NBA pace car.  This isn't from like this year.  No?  I don't know.  Why the white car?  Yeah, exactly.  How long you been at that house?  You might want to ask somebody about the white car.  Yes, mother. 
[00:45:30]  11 years, I think?  11 years, but Google Earth from 11 years ago then, maybe?  Maybe.  Yeah.  Definitely.  So there's no text messages whatsoever that will trace.  There's not one Facebook message or post that can be traced.  It all just separated.  I got...  So were your parents bummed out that the pool party was canceled?  A little bit, yeah.  Were they ready and waiting?  They were, yeah.  I mean, they had all the food and stuff.  And what were your parents doing?  Day of party?  Like, just helping prepare and stuff?  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  Like what?  Just like getting the cookies done and all that?  Yeah.  And did they notice that no one was coming?  When did they...  No, I'm on to...  My mom...  Oh, okay.  My mom was the one who was like, why don't you just like, you know...  Cancel it?  Yeah.  And what was your dad doing that morning?  He was golfing.  Yeah.  Well, you did tell us very recently that your parents would not be at the pool party because  they had to bring your brother to college.  Oh, shit.  I know who said this.  And one lazy geek, thank you for reminding me.  That's right.  He did say that.  Did an intern, Rob, say his parents were going to be away for the barbecue because his brother 
[00:46:30]  was going to college?  That's right.  We were making risky business jokes.  My brother's moving into a house.  What is this about?  Into a house.  You weren't going to try to kill us, were you?  I was.  No.  So now your brother...  Now, that's a great point.  Why were they home when they weren't supposed to be home?  Because my brother wasn't moving until Sunday.  No.  No.  But you told us this was going now.  I know.  That was last week or two weeks ago.  But you forgot that point until we just brought it up.  Because I...  When did your mom make the cookies?  Yesterday? 
[00:47:00]  Yesterday?  Yesterday.  Yesterday's Sunday.  I mean...  Two days ago.  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  Don't even try to say that you meant to say it's fucking Saturday!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  They just keep tripping up and tripping up.  So the cookies were made yesterday.  Yesterday.  And yesterday is probably true. 
[00:47:30]  For Saturday's party.  Delicious cookies made yesterday.  Oh my God.  To make good and bring in here today to try to take people's mind off of non-cookies.  Oh man.  I did ask.  The cookie thing, by the way, has nothing to do with the pool pool.  Right.  I just asked for more cookies because I forgot to bring some home.  And I do like his mom's cooking.  But now that I know he's a complete psychopath, I'm not taking a bite out of any fucking cookie.  But that is good that I ate two.  I wouldn't be surprised if he bakes these himself.  Like he knows how to bake well.  And he just puts doilies and everything in. 
[00:48:00]  All right.  We all...  Uh-oh.  Here comes Sal.  Oh no.  You guys got something?  And Travis.  Cover your balls.  I think he's ready.  Oh.  Oh boy.  Travis, you coming to maybe kick him in the balls?  You got anything on this, Travis?  I just want a cookie before he leaves with him.  Oh yeah, that's true.  This is all really, really weird.  Isn't it weird?  Really weird.  It's just weird.  Now, Rob, do you even admit this is a little odd looking in from the outside?  I would think it would be.  Can I see your phone, please?  Can we go through your call history?  I mean, you guys have made a lot of great points about everything. 
[00:48:30]  Crazy.  I thought maybe it was much ado about nothing at first.  But then the more and more you guys...  More you delve in.  Definitely.  There's just things...  This is my expertise.  I smell this shit way before anyone else.  There's just things that don't make sense.  He's a pathological liar, but I don't know what this is about.  He's trying to be something that he's not.  What did you do on Saturday?  I don't know what it is.  Oh, good question.  Look at his face.  He's fucking getting that pissed off.  I like Detective Roberts.  Detective Roberts is really doing a good job here, too. 
[00:49:00]  What did you do Saturday?  Saturday afternoon and then also Saturday evening.  That's right.  What did you do?  Saturday, I hung out with my brother.  Where?  In Nyack.  What was going on in Nyack?  His voice was cracked.  What were you doing in Nyack?  Drinking.  Just went to the bar.  A bar?  The Black Bear.  Okay.  What time did you go?  Black Bear.  So you were with the funny looking one.  Just kind of funny looking.  You're giving him time to think.  Yeah.  It was a joke, by the way. 
[00:49:30]  A little levity.  You gave him a time to think.  We left at like 9 p.m.?  Yeah.  So what did you do in the afternoon, then?  I hung out with him.  Just hanging out at his house.  At his house?  Yeah.  So he drove in the nice weather.  His new house.  New place?  No.  He moved Sunday.  So where does he...  So you were just kind of hanging out at...  Well, I was helping him like get ready and stuff to move.  Where does he live?  Well, he moves from Montclair to my town now.  Why?  Your town?  Because, I don't know.  His lease was up... 
[00:50:00]  But he's in Nyack now?  No, he was in Montclair.  Why is he moving...  Hold on.  Why is he moving to your town?  I don't know.  Just because...  You said that your parents were moving him to college.  No, I didn't.  He's married.  No, no.  He said he was moving.  He didn't say college.  You sure?  Yeah.  Positive.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  But wait a minute.  He lives in Nyack now?  No, he lives in my town now.  Okay.  He doesn't live in your town yet.  Well, yeah, he does.  Your parents are going to fucking move him yesterday.  Because he moved him on Sunday.  So, technically, now it's Monday.  Yeah, but you hear what you say. 
[00:50:30]  All right.  Thank you.  Nyack is close.  Where were you hanging out with...  But Nyack is the city that I brought up earlier.  You were hanging out with him in Nyack Saturday?  Mm-hmm.  But now he lives in your town because your parents moved him in yesterday?  Yeah.  We all helped him move in.  So, when did your mom bake the cookies?  I guess last night.  Last night.  When I was doing your show.  Again.  Last night.  Wait, wait, wait.  But you said they were for the party.  And just a minute ago, when you said Sunday, you went, oh.  Oh, wait, wait.  I guess I mean Saturday. 
[00:51:00]  But now you're saying Sunday?  Definitely.  She did make the cookies Sunday.  Sunday, yeah.  And it was also...  Oh, no!  Okay.  All right.  So, why did you say those cookies were made for the party?  Because she was going to make them for the party.  Wait, the day...  But the party was only canceled at 11.  Yeah, when was she going to make cookies?  At 3 o'clock when we were all frolicking in the pool making love?  No, make it...  She makes them fresh.  Oh, man!  This is like a little bit of water starting to seep through the dam. 
[00:51:30]  Little.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  It's gushing at this point.  What are you talking about, Sam?  I think it is.  So, what time was she going to make the cookies, son?  How long did they take to make?  Like an hour.  From scratch?  Yeah.  They take an hour to make from scratch?  Yeah, it's pretty easy.  Just...  Wow.  Yeah.  Follow the ingredients on the back of a...  Where's Kenny?  Kenny used to do this for a living.  We're doing a good job, bud.  He fell apart on the cookie thing.  Oh, yeah.  And if there's one thing, there's got to be more. 
[00:52:00]  I mean, it's...  So, you called your friends?  Some of them?  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't you show Anthony one phone call to a friend that proves that you would fucking  cancel this pool?  Well, I don't know.  The fucking name on his phone is just a name.  Better at least have a time stamp on it.  Yeah, let's just see.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, Sam.  What calls were going out where?  Detective Roberts.  Detective Roberts.  You're with Phone Forensics.  That's right.  You check that out.  People calling you worst liar ever, by the way.  Oh, man.  What's that?  Eyepatch Kid?  Eyepatch Kid was rough. 
[00:52:30]  Eyepatch Kid was bad.  You might have to play that in the 10 o'clock hour.  I love the Eyepatch Kid.  Eyepatch Intern.  Dummy.  That was pretty creepy, too.  There's a lot of Saturday calls.  Oh, good.  That's good in your favor.  This one was at 8.30.  You call somebody at 8.30 on a Saturday?  Why did you call them at 8.30 on a Saturday?  No, a.m.  Why did you call them?  Why did you call them at 8.30 a.m.?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Why did you call your friend at 8.30 a.m.?  Yeah.  Because, I don't know, we were just talking, and I said I might cancel the pool party. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, my.  Are you sure it wasn't to go, look, do you want to come to this party?  Oh, boy.  Do you want to come over?  The party wasn't canceled at 8.30.  No, it wasn't.  Right.  I'm pa...  Okay.  And for friends who aren't up at 6.30 on a weekday, you call them at 8.30 on a weekend?  Exactly.  A good point.  Yeah, that's even rougher.  Yeah, when they all fucking...  That's rough.  They like to sleep in on Monday?  Yeah, what the fuck?  But Saturday, they're up jogging at 8.30?  Glue Glooman from North Carolina.  Let Iraq run his ghost program on his phone. 
[00:53:30]  He'll find the text.  Yeah, true.  Iraq, do you have his text messages?  No, I spoke to him on the phone.  What do you think of this whole situation, Iraq?  But you're pretty fucking naive yourself.  Thanks.  True.  He is, right?  He's a gullible dude.  You're kind of gullible, Iraq.  Thank you.  That was not necessary, but...  Big gullible dunce.  That was even less necessary.  But it's fair to say you're a bit more gullible than other people in the studio.  You're getting off the point here.  But I just want to see what you say with that... 
[00:54:00]  You know, putting that...  A fair point is that you're a trusting pile of shit.  What's your vibe on this whole thing?  Well, a lot of this isn't making sense.  Because I was in the same area of where he lives.  I understand the rain and whatnot, but by 9 o'clock it was fine.  Got Anthony's text saying we need his address.  I think I might go.  I call him up.  Oh, hey.  Oh, yeah.  The party's canceled.  I'm like, why is it canceled? 
[00:54:30]  Because of rain.  I said, it stopped raining this morning.  I'm having mine.  And he's like, yeah, but we canceled the whole thing.  Why so quick to pull the trigger?  But then that's when he posted on Twitter, right after I got off the phone at the same time.  Oh, let me save myself.  Yeah.  What time did you cancel the party?  11.  11.  So you waited 12, 1, 2.  Three hours and 45 minutes to tweet that?  That doesn't make any sense.  No.  Because I didn't know anybody from here was going to come.  Eric, what time did the rain stop? 
[00:55:00]  Just after 9 a.m.  Two hours without rain.  It was just after 9 a.m.  Oh, no.  It became beautiful by...  I know.  We had to be out of our joint at 10 in the morning.  And by then, it was a beautiful sunny day.  Wait, so 9.  Beautiful.  10, 11, 12, 1, 2.  That's five hours and 46 minutes later.  Almost six hours later do you tweet it.  Because I didn't know you guys were going to come.  But for anybody, not just us.  You didn't know anybody was coming because all you did was...  Yeah, we're just part of the Facebook thing.  We're just part of the event. 
[00:55:30]  And by the way, how did you know only X amount of people were going to come?  What are they...  How did they tell you that they were coming?  Because it says on Facebook, like...  Yes, no, maybe.  Are you coming?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that event is now...  Non-existent.  Because once you cancel it, it's gone.  See, I don't know about that.  Yeah, I don't know Facebook either.  Like, you could create an event right now and then cancel it and it'll say, this is gone.  Right.  But I just don't believe that nobody emailed or texted about that party. 
[00:56:00]  That's my issue is right there.  That there's not one bit of traceable evidence.  Nothing.  I find it hard to believe it.  Like you said, the digital age takes more effort to wipe stuff out.  To wipe everything out.  The whole record of that party, gone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's an iPhone.  Why would you delete the texts?  Why would you, like, when someone texted you...  I don't want to see your text...  Is your phone open?  I don't want to see your text messages.  Don't worry.  But how...  Troy?  It's a conspiracy. 
[00:56:30]  How far down do your texts go?  Troy has had it.  This is going to be good because Troy has questions.  You have questions, Troy?  Yeah.  Take the mic, man.  Well, you can't direct message in a Facebook event page.  And if you are...  And if you were contacting people through there and you deleted it, how are you contacting  them?  Right.  It's deleted.  Because I deleted it last night.  It wasn't like...  Not last night.  Two nights ago.  Oh.  Two nights at night time, though. 
[00:57:00]  It wasn't like...  Boy, why would you delete it at night?  Yeah, you said...  Why would you delete it at night?  If the party was canceled during the day, why would you leave the event up all day?  So people know it's gone.  So people know it's canceled.  You said when you cancel the party, the message gets deleted.  Yeah.  Now you're saying first you canceled the party, then you specifically went and deleted the  message.  I said on the Facebook thing, hey guys, it's going to be canceled, you know, and so and  so.  And then...  Because the first we're hearing that you changed your Facebook thing and said it was going 
[00:57:30]  to be canceled.  In the event page, it's just like a little timeline of who says well.  Are you friends with anybody from the show?  You, Roland and Travis.  I wish Roland and Travis have those messages.  And who else RSVP'd to this party?  Because then if you go to their timeline, it'll say, so and so RSVP'd to Rob's pool party.  That doesn't just disappear, does it?  It won't because it says it's a private stash thing.  It's like private.  You have to be invited.  Why would it be a private thing?  It's like invite only. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, but if you invited those people, so it will be on their timeline.  No.  Yes.  No, I'm telling you.  Well, go to one of their pages that they have accepted it.  Why would it be there?  If you're going to it, why would it be private?  And as he does that, people can't even get past the cookie thing because...  That cookie thing is rough.  Well, Blue Heeler, KY, cookies can't be from scratch if you read the back of a box.  He did say you just read the back of the box.  They are from scratch.  It's the Nestle's cookie. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, cold house recipe?  Yeah.  That's not from scratch.  Well, he means...  It's from scratch.  It just means it wasn't store-bought.  I get what he meant.  She makes all the dough and everything like that.  She or you?  She.  Okay.  She or you?  Yeah, it is.  Wait, Troy, are you coming back?  Troy, what do you think of this whole thing?  By the way, I'm getting it.  We know he's lying at this point, but what is this about?  That's what I'm trying to figure out now.  I think he set it up.  He had this idea for a pool party.  Yeah.  He wanted to bring out chicks to impress everybody here.  He probably was telling his friends, I'm interning for Opie and Anthony. 
[00:59:00]  They love me.  Mostly interns, you know, but they're going to actually come to my pool party.  They're going to come to my pool party.  I'm going to bring all these hot chicks.  I'm going to show everybody how cool I am.  And then he couldn't get any girls.  And then nobody really said, oh, yeah, I'm definitely coming.  Yeah.  So he just canceled the whole thing and just kind of he's trying to just let it slide.  So do you think that in a humiliated fashion, he just because there were no girls coming to his party,  he was just like kind of embarrassed that it would just be 10 of us and his mom or five of us and his mom. 
[00:59:30]  So he was hoping it would just go away.  He just wanted to sweep it under the rug and be like, oh, the weather was fucked up.  I canceled it.  I got a text from one of my friends who's like, he promotes events.  Even when you cancel an event, it still shows the canceled event in past events.  Oh, past events.  But he's saying with past events.  Oh, like the private thing.  Why wouldn't that still be in there?  How about he shows us what he did?  Yeah.  Go to your Facebook page and set up a private event and then cancel it. 
[01:00:00]  You're like, why wouldn't it be in private?  Why wouldn't it be in your past one just because it was private?  Why does it get wiped out?  I think you're giving him too much credit.  There's too many other weird lies there.  I know.  Like the parents were moving his brother, but they're at the house.  They're not moving him anymore.  The cookie thing.  He wasn't sure how much beer he actually bought.  He was able to come up with two, maybe three, 30 packs.  Troy, you party a lot, right?  He mentioned soda that anyone would mention.  Is 90 beers for 12 people somewhat excessive?  A little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, it depends.  But I mean, Anthony is coming. 
[01:00:30]  Exactly.  That would have tipped the scales.  Well, I didn't know I was coming, so.  That's true.  This cannot be undone.  Yes.  What is he doing?  What is he doing here?  Did you just make an event?  Create an event.  Watch.  Rob will be making an ass out of himself and then put today.  Making an ass out of himself.  Okay.  So then you do invite only.  Create.  And it's the low voice that drives me nuts?  Yeah.  That's a sign of a fucking psychopath.  That's smooth for, you know, everything. 
[01:01:00]  You're not going to get to me, man.  Now you go cancel event.  Wait, wait, wait.  First, try to send it to Sam.  Send him that event.  And then try to direct message him.  Let's see that.  It wasn't a direct message.  I was saying I wrote it on, like, this thing.  Like, on the timeline.  But you said you DMed everybody.  You said you DMed everybody.  You direct message Sam on Twitter.  I direct message Sam on Twitter.  No, no.  You said you DMed all the guests to tell them they weren't.  I meant, like, just wrote it on the wall.  Oh, that's a wall.  That's not a DM.  He's changing it now.  Your story changes, Rob.  Yeah. 
[01:01:30]  Your story's changing a lot.  Changes like a bunch of outfits.  You are tripping up.  It's fine.  Never murder somebody because you'd get caught in a second.  You're terrible.  Rob, it's better that you just come clean.  What does this whole come about?  The boss wants you to come clean.  Just take a beating, please.  What is this about?  I need to know.  All right.  No one wanted to come.  Okay.  Oh.  Oh, man.  Now he's all sad.  All right.  Jeez.  Now you're just saying that to shut us up, or is that really what happened?  I mean, there were people going to come, but it wasn't, like, that many people. 
[01:02:00]  You just said, I mean, there were people that were going to come.  Like, it was just, like, how many girls?  It wasn't this big blast you wanted to have?  Yeah, it wasn't really, like, this big blast that I wanted to have, you know, end the summer off right.  You see this?  Saturday, August 18th.  What?  There's no events list.  Because, look, if you cancel it, though, watch.  Wait, did you send it to Sam now?  Did you send that to Sam?  I don't think he's friends with him.  I don't think I'm friends with him.  Well, send it to Travis, then.  Send it to Travis.  Say, hey, queer, we're having an event.  And Travis would have to respond in the affirmative, as people did. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, yeah, tell Travis, I'm sure he's listening, so tell Travis to respond in the affirmative.  Or, Travis, please respond in the affirmative.  All right, I send one to Travis.  Okay.  Tim P. in Iowa's got it.  He's really homeless and alone, roaming and murdering old women after he makes them bake cookies.  And then Tim writes, enjoy the baked goods, guys.  And he fucking caves our head in like the Night Stalker with a lamp.  So Travis is also going.  Do you even go to college?  I do.  I'm going back to Sunday. 
[01:03:00]  Okay.  Sunday, huh?  Travis is going.  He said, can't wait.  Ready?  Okay.  Now cancel the event.  It's canceled.  It's canceled.  Now.  Now look in past events or something.  Or find out if it's still on Travis's.  By the way, if that were the case and it just becomes non-existent when you cancel an event,  why would anybody, nobody would go on their Facebook and be like, oh, this event doesn't exist, 
[01:03:30]  simply isn't there anymore.  It must be canceled.  Right.  You would have a record.  Yes.  I wrote it, I wrote on the wall that it was canceled.  Well, where's the wall?  It's gone.  Exactly.  It's gone.  Like, I just did the same thing with Travis.  Oh no, here comes Travis.  Oh, Travis's sig pic makes me sick.  Like him and Mike are good friends.  Oh yeah, Mike Tyson.  Yeah.  That was a great day.  Oh, it was unbelievable.  Travis, go ahead.  What do you got, buddy?  I was really excited for this big event that Rob invited me to, but then he canceled it 
[01:04:00]  and it's no longer on my calendar.  But it was, there wasn't a notification of, is there, I got a notification that said Rob  canceled the event.  Is there any, any record whatsoever on your page that that happened?  No.  I mean, in my notifications, but once I click off notifications, it's, there's no like message  from Rob saying like, Hey guys, canceled the party.  But you can look in your notifications and you can see that there was indeed at some point 
[01:04:30]  a party.  No, I can, I can look at my notifications and see that Rob canceled the party.  Okay.  Okay.  There you go.  Fine.  There you go.  That's in your notifications right now.  Yeah.  Okay.  So Rob should be able to look into his notifications and say you canceled an event.  Right.  Well, is it in his notifications right now that he canceled it?  No.  No.  See, there's a problem.  Now, why would it be in your notifications that it was canceled, but not, no, no, no.  I'm saying Travis has it in his notification.  Is it in his notification that he just canceled that?  I don't know. 
[01:05:00]  Go to your Facebook.  Yeah.  I'm in my Facebook.  And go to events.  Go to events.  Oh boy.  Or go to notifications.  And I don't know why Travis, since he's friends with him on Facebook, wouldn't have been  invited to the Facebook.  Yeah.  That's a great point.  I would have seen that.  Travis, you're a friend.  Why didn't he see?  Yeah.  Why wasn't Travis invited on Facebook?  Because I invited him here.  Yeah.  Why would you just do it to make it look like you had more going on at your party?  Okay.  All right.  So there's, I don't believe there's just zero record when you, there's nothing.  Yeah.  This is it.  Well, I'm here.  I'm just going to grab another cookie. 
[01:05:30]  Go ahead.  Go for it.  So good.  I think he was just hiding, hoping no one would show up.  Yeah.  What if I showed up on Friday?  He kept telling me to come.  Oh man.  Yeah.  That's what I said.  I go, what if I had the invite?  How did he let you know, Travis?  I didn't.  Know what?  You didn't let Travis know?  Let me know.  You don't even let Travis know he was going to come, but if you're having a party, that's  your responsibility.  But you invite people, you invite people, you'd cancel the party, but don't tell anybody. 
[01:06:00]  Do you understand how impossible it is to get Anthony?  I couldn't get him to go to his own party.  Oh no.  You had him going and you literally, he was going to show up and no one would have been  there.  On Friday, he's telling me, you know, like bring my daughter.  We got a pool.  I got a golden retriever.  What if I showed up?  So you said that to Travis?  Yeah.  And what did Travis say?  Oh no, I'm not going.  What did he say?  Maybe I will.  You said maybe I will, but then you cancel the party and don't even tell him?  Because I didn't really think you would come.  You can't.  But that's not how you can think.  But that's not how you can think.  You can't bank on the fact that maybe he might not come. 
[01:06:30]  Right.  What if he pulled up all fucking ready to go and again, you just come to the door?  Oh man.  Or whoever lives in that fucking nice house comes to the door.  That's what I'm thinking.  Mr. White Carr.  Oh Jesus.  Yeah.  What is really going on?  You're skirting around something.  Oh man, is he skirting?  I'm really not.  You're not this perfect kid.  Thank God.  Skirter.  Thank God.  Because that was bugging me.  How many girls did you have to confirm?  How many girls?  Like five or six?  Mm-hmm.  Wait.  Out of the ten that were coming, six of them were girls? 
[01:07:00]  Like out of ten?  Sixty percent of your guests were girls and you canceled it?  No.  They were coming?  Right?  Yeah.  But I mean, they weren't.  Some of them weren't.  You're saying five or six.  There were like two of them that were actually good looking.  But you said.  Oh.  Five or six.  It was just like, I don't know.  So you had five or six girls coming to your house.  Oh boy.  And you canceled it.  It was more like three.  See?  No.  Now he's just talking.  Oh, Jesus.  Do you think it was more like zero?  No.  More like zero.  Do you think the number was closer to zero? 
[01:07:30]  Do you even have friends?  Let's start there.  I do.  It's 7-15.  One of them is up.  One of them works or does something.  I'll call them.  Call them from here.  But just tell them that they're on the air before you put them on speaker.  You got to tell them that they're on the air.  By the way, you know, he's going to college like this weekend or whatever.  You'd think that if there were people around, they'd be like,  of course we'll go to the party.  This is the last time we'll get to hang out before we're back in school.  That's right.  This is the last big fucking party. 
[01:08:00]  If you had five or six girls confirmed,  that's a lot of girls to get to go to your party.  Right.  Out of 10 people.  Yeah.  It really is.  90 beers.  Who are you calling, by the way?  My friend Sean.  How about a girl?  Call one of the girls.  60% of the guests were...  No, we don't want to hear the...  If 60% of their calls were girls,  let's get a check.  A young lady.  A young lady?  Yes.  Anything?  He's calling a young lady. 
[01:08:30]  I think he just wanted all of us to come over to his house.  Really?  Yeah, that's what I think.  Yeah.  Obviously.  There ain't nobody else.  Oh, no.  Yeah, I don't think anybody else was there.  No, I think Troy was right.  I think that he was afraid that the turnout was going to be a big dud-a-roo.  Yeah.  And he was humiliated that he would be ridiculed on the air for an hour and 15 minutes.  Uh-huh.  That's what I'm thinking.  Right? 
[01:09:00]  Let's get a girl on the phone.  Come on.  You got to know...  Get some chick.  Jesus, what are they fucking vampires, these people?  They all crawl back in their coffin at five?  Get a chick on the phone.  Get one person on the phone.  Get a broad, a dame.  And the deleted text messages, I have a hard time believing.  I do, too.  Of course.  You don't delete your text messages like that.  Especially when it's such an inconsequential text message.  An inconsequential text.  Do you have any text messages on your phone right now?  That's why I asked him to get his phone out before that Troy came out.  You have a couple.  How far back?  Why aren't they deleted?  How far back do they go?  Let's see.  What do you think you don't know?  I don't want to read your text. 
[01:09:30]  I'm not going to read your text.  Now, let me see.  Go down there.  Sam, make sure he doesn't fuck around.  Oh, my God.  It is literally full of text messages.  There is a heaping helping of text messages on that phone.  How far back do they go?  When you cancel the text.  Show me.  How far back?  Don't, we don't delete your text.  I don't know.  Well, show Sam.  I'm not going to read the content.  He's losing it.  He's losing it, all right.  Show Sam.  How far back do they go?  Let me see.  How far back?  I'm just going to look at the date.  Okay, yesterday.  A lot of texting yesterday for somebody who called.  There's Saturday.  Saturday.  Saturday. 
[01:10:00]  Friday.  Okay.  Friday.  So you saved all those messages from last week.  But what did you go in and like edit and then delete the ones that mention the  party?  Because when you just go delete, you start from the beginning and just delete, delete.  Or did you delete the individual messages out of the conversation just so no mention  of the party would be?  Yeah, you wanted to wipe it away.  No.  Were you lying when you said you deleted the text messages?  Yeah.  Oh, another lie.  But what is this about?  We all know this is horseshit, but what is this about?  That's what I need to know.  I don't even know if there was a party plan.  Yeah, what is going on, Rob? 
[01:10:30]  What is a party plan?  I don't think there was even a party plan.  I just wanted to impress you guys and have fun, but I wanted my friends to be there  also.  And then you guys just didn't show up.  But I was going to.  But you didn't even know they weren't showing up.  Yeah, you didn't.  And I planned on it until that day.  I thought it would be a fun thing for the show.  We'd all show up.  There was a conversation that made it possible that these guys were going to show up.  I was away, but Jimmy, there was a very good possibility they were going to show up.  And that conversation with Travis, to me, sounds like, you know, wow, I better fucking  make sure Travis knows because he sounded like he could show up. 
[01:11:00]  He's got a kid, a pool, kid pool.  Was the weather the reason you canceled the party?  It was a little bit because of it.  How much?  Like what percent?  Probably like 45.  Four percent, maybe?  45.  Because the weather was beautiful.  I would have loved to take a dip.  Yeah.  I know Anthony was looking to.  As a matter of fact, he had to go to his home pool.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Thank God I fucking just fucking stayed home.  Is there beer in your house right now?  Yeah.  90 cans? 
[01:11:30]  Do you have 90 cans of beer at your house?  Not 90 cans, but I said it was between.  How many?  How much beer do you have at your house?  How many cans?  How much beer at your house?  45 and 50.  Yeah.  Okay.  It was either 60 or 90.  Yeah.  So he lied about the text message.  It was either 60 or 90.  So I was drinking on Saturday.  How about we get...  No, you were drinking at a bar Saturday.  Travis, yes.  How about forehand?  How about we get one of Rob's parents or siblings...  Yeah.  We all have smartphones...  ...to take a picture of all the excess beer that Rob still has at his house. 
[01:12:00]  Yes.  And the hot dogs and hamburgers are still in the refrigerator.  And just send us an email.  Or just text it, yeah.  Where's the hot dogs and hamburgers now?  Where are they?  They're just sitting there.  Yeah.  Must be like an industrial-sized fridge.  Might not be lying.  It might be a pack of...  Sure.  A four-pack of fucking hamburgers.  Oh, a four-pack of Oscar Mayer and some fucking...  A box of Mikey burgers.  Looks like his cookie is starting to crumble, Blue Heeler says.  I don't think the cancellation was weather-based.  No, and weather is so easy because it cleared up before noon. 
[01:12:30]  So all you do is just say, hey, guys, party back on.  Back on.  It cleared up at 9 o'clock.  Most people aren't even awake.  That is true.  All of your friends apparently don't get up until late.  Someone's saying he deletes all his text messages because he's got the OCD.  I was starting to think that with Rob.  Okay, maybe he's one of those guys who has to keep his phone nice and clean.  But the fact is, he does have text messages from Friday, from Saturday, and from yesterday.  Lots of them.  Lots of them.  Again, it would have been harder to delete just those messages. 
[01:13:00]  And for someone who a minute ago said they always call, he's got a shit ton of text messages.  A shit ton of text messages.  For somebody who always calls.  Call and text.  Shit ton of texts.  I would love to know those text messages from Saturday.  Yeah, it doesn't make sense to me.  Will you allow Sam to read some text messages?  No, I won't.  You can open them and show us the ones you want to show.  We won't go through your phone.  But there's nothing about it.  No, I bet you if we read the text messages from Saturday, it would prove a lot. 
[01:13:30]  How is it?  There'd be something in there that proves there was never a party.  I can open up my phone right now.  You'll take the cum with your legs wrapped around me.  That's the one I got, by the way.  I didn't send it to you.  Shut up.  Funny.  So yeah, why would you just delete the one?  That doesn't make sense to me.  To selectively delete anything about, like, that's bizarre, Rob. 
[01:14:00]  Because it was like, I don't know.  There weren't any deleted text messages.  There were.  I deleted some.  Why?  What did you delete and what?  What's the criteria for deletion?  Why and when?  You didn't delete any.  I did.  Why?  Which ones did you delete?  Because two girls.  Why?  I don't know.  It was just, I had some naughty stuff on there.  Oh my God, you already said that you deleted text messages, canceling the party.  Can you stop?  Get rid of the dirty stuff.  Yuck.  Keep all the banal ones from Friday. 
[01:14:30]  I don't want anyone, like, in my family just going through my phone.  But that's not what you said earlier.  Why would they?  You said you texted people telling the parties off, but then deleted those messages.  And that's why you can't prove it to us that you did that.  But now you're saying you deleted messages because you were talking naughty.  It was naughty.  And they were all two to come.  Totally different things.  Oh, very coincidentally, the ones who were talking dirty were the ones who were coming.  And that's why you canceled the party, because some dirty chicks were coming?  Yeah, wow.  That doesn't make sense.  That doesn't make any sense.  Yeah, get rid of those, the whores.  We don't want them at the party.  Yeah.  Didn't he say that, Sam? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  He was texting people to say the parties off, and then we're like, all right, prove that.  He goes, well, I deleted those.  Okay, the first thing's for you.  Now he's saying he's deleting text messages because he was.  You didn't text anybody to tell them the party was off?  No, I didn't.  Oh, no, I didn't.  They texted me.  Another one.  No, they texted you.  They would text you and say, is the party off?  And then say, yeah.  Why would they text that?  Why would they text that on a beautiful sunny day?  Let's see one of those.  I don't have one.  Oh, my God.  You deleted every one of those. 
[01:15:30]  You were just like, yeah, the party's off, but guess what's on?  And you started sexting.  By the way, a little life lesson for everyone that doesn't know this yet.  These are the people you really got to worry about.  It's not the ones that act up and are lunatics.  It's guys like this.  Wow.  The smooth ones are the craziest ones.  I'm not crazy.  When you see that guy on the street corner like, ah, and shitting himself, those guys are harmless.  It's kids like this that are fucking lunatics.  Oh, my God.  Holy fuck, I'm creeped out. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, Rob, you're not making sense, honestly.  I know.  But I don't even know what's real anymore.  I don't even know if there was a pool party.  I don't know.  There was.  There really was.  Were there deleted text messages?  Yeah.  How many people?  And you deleted them because they were dirty.  Yeah.  But how many were clean?  It wasn't everybody that you were being dirty with.  How many people responded to you via text about the party saying, oh, shucks or drat?  And he went, yeah, I know, LOL.  And then how many of those instances, was there a give and take and there was a delusion? 
[01:16:30]  Two.  Just two.  Both were girls that you were talking dirty to.  Yeah.  So now you save these other text messages.  Because all these ones don't have anything bad.  Right.  So you don't put any kind of a password on your phone.  Yeah, I do.  So you have a password on your phone.  But like.  You delete the dirty text messages, but keep the clean ones from your friends.  Because the only reason I have the password is because my lock button doesn't work.  So I have it on here.  Yeah, but regardless, you have the password.  Irregardless.  You do have a password. 
[01:17:00]  I don't know.  So there's not one guy in this room.  There's not one dirty texting guy in this room that believes you just immediately delete  two dirty texts while you have a password.  Because I don't want my password.  My mom knows my password.  It's 5555555.  Wait, how does your mom know your password?  So change it.  Because she's worked.  I mean.  Yeah, why?  There's a billion choices out there.  Well, why would you have a password and then give it out on the radio?  Right.  And why does your mom know it?  Why does mommy know your password?  Because it's just the locks button.  And then she would use my phone.  Like, hey, I need to make phone calls. 
[01:17:30]  Why does she need to use your phone?  And she might go through your text messages.  Do you even have a mom?  Your mom uses your phone?  Why?  Why does she use your phone?  She has a phone?  No, she does.  So she has a phone.  And a house phone.  And a house phone.  Why does she use your phone?  Because maybe it's her phone's, I don't know, another place.  Yeah, in this day and age, no one's near their place.  She doesn't carry your phone around.  Oh, my God.  I don't carry my phone.  This kid is a lunatic.  I really love it.  This is a great example of how you just wear someone down and their story falls apart with 
[01:18:00]  enough interrogation.  Do you really carry your phone around all the time?  All I shit with it.  Are you kidding me?  Two of them.  Two of them.  Of course you do.  I don't carry my phone around.  There's not a personal lie that does it.  When I'm at my house.  Do you have your truthful phone and your liar boy phone?  Do you?  And by the way, if you don't have your phone, someone that relies heavily on technology,  like an event thing, of course you're going to have your phone with you.  And the beauty of this whole thing, by the way, Sam and Iraq, you guys pretty much  picked the interns? 
[01:18:30]  Iraq does.  I'm not allowed to anymore.  I thought you guys were getting soft because we always get fucking lunatics.  And I'm like, wow, we actually got a normal kid.  This is a little strange and a little different.  And now it's like, okay, no, it's just like everyone else that has come and gone.  So your mom will use your phone once in a while around the house instead of the home  phone?  Yeah.  And I'll say this.  For what reason?  For somebody who doesn't text the guy in the white car.  For somebody.  Dear Shalamar.  So now your mom uses, does she check your messages?  No.  But you're afraid she might go on there and see, what were you saying to a girl? 
[01:19:00]  You don't have to say who it is.  What were you saying?  I don't know.  Just like, not like dirty, dirty, but like it was just flirting.  Yeah.  And it was like flirting.  So what?  It was like flirting stuff.  Like what?  If it's flirting, you could say it on the air.  Like what?  You could say it.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It was just like, hey, you know, like, hey, why don't you come over and stuff like  that and we'll, you know.  Yeah.  You better get rid of that.  That's great.  You know, mom's seeing that.  Whoa.  And by the way, God forbid mom knows you like girls.  He just said, in the conversation, in the conversation where he said the start of the 
[01:19:30]  conversation was, I'm canceling the party.  Yeah.  The second part of the conversation was, why don't you come over?  He just said, wow, oh no.  And another note, for somebody who doesn't carry their phone around the house very much,  he has massive amounts of calls and texts that he made on Saturday and Sunday.  Like there's no way he doesn't have the phone.  Like he's on the phone all the time. 
[01:20:00]  Everyone has their phone all the time.  There's no reason not to.  What do you put it back in the phone cradle?  Yeah.  Keep it in your pocket.  I find it hard to believe that you canceled, coincidentally, the specific ones with party  mentions.  That doesn't make sense, Rob.  Do you have the new invites or?  The new, oh no, I forgot to make them.  For Saturday.  Wait a minute.  You have a new party this Saturday?  Yeah.  Have you made a Facebook thing?  Not yet. 
[01:20:30]  Today's Monday.  When are you making it?  Why wouldn't you make it immediately?  Why wouldn't you say that and make it worse for yourself?  Or do you immediately and say like, hey, the party was canceled, but here's next week,  the new party.  Or change the date on the event.  Right.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That's a good point.  Why wouldn't you just change the date on the event?  I didn't really think about postponing it until later in the day.  No, you just said you canceled it at 11 o'clock.  Do you understand?  Like, I remember shit.  He said earlier that one of the reasons why the pool party was canceled was because everyone  was going back to college.  So why would you now have a pool party this Saturday? 
[01:21:00]  Maybe they go to very quick colleges?  Yes.  It's one week.  You said that was one of the reasons why the pool party was canceled.  That's right.  People are going back to college.  But now you're going to have a new party this Saturday when it's even more possible that  kids are going back to college?  I mean, I'm going back to school on Sunday.  Oh, my God.  We'll see.  Where do you go to college?  Do you even go to college?  Is this an illegal internship?  Illegal.  I just find it hard to believe that there's nothing traceable about this. 
[01:21:30]  It's like this party has been just wiped away.  I don't believe there were any deleted text messages.  I don't either.  And I don't believe there was ever a Facebook event.  I don't either.  That's fine.  I don't think those are true statements.  It's okay.  All right.  I believe the party was always just the people he gave invitations to here.  And some girl.  I think he has some chicks.  Maybe some girl.  No, he doesn't know girls.  He wanted to get some girl.  He tried.  He was trying.  That fell through.  Had to cancel the whole thing. 
[01:22:00]  And instead of canceling it like somebody would a party, he buried his head in the sand  and hoped no one would show up.  Yeah.  And yeah, that's pretty much it.  Instead of coming in and just going, all right, guys, I'm a zilch.  I couldn't get any chicks.  I was embarrassed.  Did you want this girl to hang with you?  Yeah.  Which one?  On Saturday.  After I canceled it, it's like, hey, why don't you still come over and we'll hang out?  And did she?  No.  But she was going to come to the party.  Yeah.  But she wouldn't come hang with you.  We proved he doesn't really know. 
[01:22:30]  Great party.  Way before the pool party, we proved he doesn't really know girls.  Yeah.  So why wouldn't she come over and just hang with you?  What happened in her day that all of a sudden that was changed?  I don't know.  I didn't really.  Hang on.  She just said no?  Yeah.  Why don't you come over?  No.  But girls are notorious for giving a reason.  She didn't give you a reason.  It was just because she had something else to do.  I don't know.  So why didn't you say that?  Were you planning a legitimate rape?  What did she have to do?  Yeah.  What did she have to do?  I don't know.  I didn't ask.  I was, oh, I got to cancel on you.  What about the other one?  Wait, she had to cancel on you? 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  But it was never set up.  What was there to cancel if you canceled the party?  It was never set up.  I don't know.  She wasn't coming.  Oh, my God.  You guys are just laying questions on me left and right.  I don't even have time to think.  He just goes, I don't know.  Like, he's resigned himself.  You know, take me to prison.  You don't need time to think.  She's telling the truth.  He said that he was texting with this girl trying to get her to come over, but she never  committed to coming over.  But now he's saying that she canceled on him.  Yeah.  She was.  That didn't.  Oh, my God.  And then what were you saying that was naughty?  This doesn't sound like a very naughty conversation. 
[01:23:30]  No, no.  Are you going to take I-80?  Wink.  Oh, don't let mother see.  Mother will see this.  I don't know.  It's just, I don't.  What were you saying to her that was naughty?  I don't remember.  This is a great experiment on how this whole situation works.  Yeah.  When you question somebody that's obviously not being honest and you have enough people,  they will at some point just go, take me to jail.  Jesus, please.  Take me to fucking jail.  You should have lawyered up when you walked in the fucking door.  So what was happening?  There's something that I need to know.  There is something going on because it's fucking weird. 
[01:24:00]  Why wouldn't you?  I'm a normal kid.  I just.  No, you're not.  No, you're not a normal kid.  Did you ask her if she wants to come over and hang out with Deez?  With what?  Deez Nuts.  Ah, you fucking nailed him.  What was happening with the girl that you couldn't let your mother see the text messages?  We were just talking like naughty, dirtily.  Naughty, dirtily.  Naughty, dirtily.  I'm a dirty guy.  You're not going to offend me.  I'm a dirty guy.  The law firm of naughty, dirtily.  Naughty, dirtily.  Naughty, dirtily.  What did you text her? 
[01:24:30]  That was dirty.  What are your mesothelioma needs?  Naughty, dirtily.  Dirtily.  I'm naughty, dirtily.  Yes.  We don't collect payment unless you come.  That's right.  Pete naughty and sherm dirtily.  Give us an example of dirtily.  Yeah.  One example of dirtily.  What is something dirty?  I don't know.  I was just like how, I don't know, I want to eat your pussy or something like that.  Right.  You just blurted that out in between when you come to the pool party? 
[01:25:00]  Party's canceled, but if you want, I'll still eat your pussy.  I'll still eat your pussy.  Why don't you come over and get your cunt eaten by the empty pool?  Well, my mom's home, but she's cool.  Yeah, exactly.  She's baking cookies tomorrow.  Yeah, exactly.  Can I eat your pussy while we count the beers that no one's drinking?  Maybe I can rub frozen hot dogs on your tits.  And shove one of those up your asshole.  Let's see how many frozen burgers.  See, here's where it falls apart.  Because if you were talking dirty to that girl.  Dirtily.  Yeah, naughty or dirtily. 
[01:25:30]  Why would you have deleted it?  First of all, you always say them to jerk off to.  Of course, they're great.  And you were afraid that your mom would see them.  So you came to the party, talked dirty, and then...  I don't know.  It's just like, I mean, I would talk to her a bunch and then like...  You want to do something you're not.  You think so?  Yes.  He was like, hey, you want me to eat your pussy?  And she was like, no.  No.  Oh, okay.  How do you get to the point where you're actually saying, hey, do you want me to eat your pussy  when you're not close enough where she wouldn't give you a reason for not coming over? 
[01:26:00]  It doesn't...  She said she had something to do.  She said something to him up.  21.  Are you still a virgin?  No.  Oh.  No?  No.  No?  Now, what are you fibbing about?  Come on.  How many women have you been intimate with?  Seven.  Do you think that's true?  No.  Because he took a pause to think, but then he didn't actually think about it.  He figured seven's a good number.  Seven's a good number, yeah. 
[01:26:30]  And by the way, most times if you ask someone for a number, they'll go with seven.  I could count.  Yeah.  Wow, it's true.  That's actually a statistic.  Between one and ten.  It really is.  Most people do.  If you go, you know, give me a number from one to ten, a lot of people, more than not,  will say seven.  Seven.  That's fine.  So when you're, if you come up with a number, you're going to say seven.  Yeah, seven.  I mean.  No, what exactly are you not telling?  There's something you're holding back on.  Nothing.  I'm really not.  Rob, it's easier if you just get it out. 
[01:27:00]  Like, whatever it is.  I'm not telling you guys anything.  I mean.  We know that.  Yeah, that's the problem.  Yeah, it's, just show them, tell.  We're here to help you.  Yeah.  We're here to help.  I know.  Your life would be easier if you just spoke truthfully.  It really is always easier.  Things happen.  We understand.  We're here to help.  I'm not.  Can't wait to never see this guy again.  Wow.  I got invited to an event.  You're creeping me out, Rob.  But the cookies are delicious if your mom even made them. 
[01:27:30]  Sal says he's caught him in another lie.  Oh, no.  Sal.  What did Sal do?  Did he say Sal does a good job?  Yeah.  What did he say?  Sal's production bits are great.  Come in here with your puppet hairdo.  Sal's puppet hair bugs me.  Hey, fucking get fats in here.  I want to talk.  Where is he?  Oh, he's not fucking good. 
[01:28:00]  Puppet hair.  His fucking puppet hairdo is enraging.  All right.  There you go.  Look at his puppet hair.  Holy shit.  Hey, tell Otto I said hi.  Hey, don't get the panda angry, by the way.  Oh, no.  Roar.  Roar.  Do you still have that?  Oh, no.  B-Rock, do we have that?  It was a good production piece.  Don't get the panda angry! 
[01:28:30]  I get goosebumps from like...  That sounded like a panda.  Yeah.  That's a panda, right?  It's a lion, I think.  Are you going to make...  Speaking of lion...  Are you going to make a production piece about Rob getting angry and end it with a lion?  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  No, that's terrible.  That's Sal's calling card.  He ends all production pieces with a lion growling.  A lion growling.  Except for the Uncle Paul ones, because he puts in weird soundbites, too, which makes 
[01:29:00]  it cute.  No reason.  Guys, talking about fucking children.  You don't need bells and whistles.  Okay.  Go ahead, Sal.  Another line.  No, no.  Well, last time on the after show, Sam asked him that.  And he said seven.  Asked him what?  How many women he's been with?  Oh.  And he originally said seven, and then he was talked down to five.  Oh.  Oh.  And they were saying seven.  I can name...  I can...  Oh, yeah.  Why were you talked down to five?  There was Jennifer.  Jennifer.  Yeah, we believe that.  Wanda.  Exactly.  Wanda. 
[01:29:30]  Really?  I can name 6,000.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't mean anything.  I don't go that way.  You don't?  No.  What, girls?  How tall are you?  Five...  I mean, I figured out five, six.  I figured out.  Yeah, because Travis...  Yeah, you figured out.  You looked up and saw five, seven.  Travis, I said I was five, seven.  Remember, he lied about his height, too.  How tall are you?  I'm five, seven.  He's not even five, five.  Oh, Jesus.  Can we get a ruler?  Iraq, can we grab a ruler?  I think this has something to do with him being short.  He's a shrimp. 
[01:30:00]  It's okay.  Good looking.  Good looking.  He's a handsome guy.  I mean, someone who's a little slighter flake.  Oh, man.  Stand next to me.  I was short for many years, and then I'll fuck with your head.  I'll tell you, Jimmy.  I spent a long time being short, too.  I'm about five, six and a half.  Yeah, he's...  Yeah, he's five, four.  Five, four?  Yeah, you're diminutive.  Are we going to, like...  I'm not a big guy.  Are we going to get his height with his shoes on or off?  I'd say off.  Yeah.  I'm thinking five, five.  We could take your skipper from Gilligan's Island shoes off.  I will bet.  Boating shoes are terrible. 
[01:30:30]  I don't know what I got today, but I will bet whatever I have in my...  Skating shoes.  Maybe...  Oh, I don't have much today.  Fuck.  I'll bet...  I think I might have 50.  I'll bet 50 that he's under five, five with his shoes off.  Really?  You think so?  But someone's got to take the bet.  Under five, five.  This isn't like...  This is...  Someone's got to take the bet.  Rob will take the bet.  Will you take that bet, Rob?  What do...  If I lose, what do I get?  You owe me 50 bucks.  I mean, if I lose, what do I give you?  You owe me 50 bucks.  I owe me 50 bucks.  And I'm going to take it.  Yeah.  I don't care how much money you make. 
[01:31:00]  If you lose, you give me 50 bucks.  I've seen your fucking house.  I'm taking the 50 bucks.  Is it five, five and under, or five, five?  What does under five, five mean to you?  Like, if it...  If I'm five, five...  If it's a schmidge, I'm under five, five, you lose.  That's a good point.  If I'm five, five, does that count, or do I have to be...  I say under five, five.  So starting at five, four, point...  You're going to win that bet.  Not nine.  Opie, you're going to win that bet.  I've seen your house.  I think he's five, four, now.  I think he's five, four, now.  How are we going to get an accurate height measure?  We've got to get...  E-Rock, or somebody get them... 
[01:31:30]  We'll just hit the 50 from Daddy, so...  Okay.  Look at all the cash in his intern spy.  Give me some of that.  Yeah, he's got a lot of cash in there.  He's got plenty.  20, 40, 60.  It's all the beer money he never used.  Oh, the beer money.  Oh, no.  Got a cookie he's received?  You got a change of a 20?  Oh.  I got nine dollars.  What?  I got...  No.  Sam, can I please have my $40?  He just lost 40.  Heisted his 40 bucks.  Are you saying you got 49 instead of 50?  I have...  Throw 60.  I'll spot you a dollar, Rob. 
[01:32:00]  You will?  Yeah.  No.  He's got 60 here.  Oh, boy.  We got a tape measure.  All right.  All right, hold on.  Where's your money?  It's right here.  All right, who's holding the bet money?  Put your money where your lying mouth is.  I don't want to let Sam hold the money.  Sam's not going to steal your money.  All right.  Jim told me not to steal it.  I want to steal it.  Yeah.  No one's going to take it here, Karen.  It's $49.  It's $49.  Yeah.  It's a bag.  It's a bag of money.  You deserve it.  You deserve it.  You deserve it.  Shut up.  No, put it on platforms.  Of course they go.  Now you should go up against the wall like a little kid, and we should mark it on the 
[01:32:30]  wall like a little...  Near me.  Why not?  By the white door.  No, but against this, you get an accurate measure.  Yeah, do it over that thing.  Right in the serious...  That looks like a measuring thing.  No, no, no.  Travis, mark his head.  Mark...  Take a flat thing and put it against his head and mark it like that.  Oh, yeah.  And then you measure it.  You get a much more accurate measurement that way.  That's tilting his head up already.  Here's what you got to do.  Here.  Here.  No, that won't work.  Get something...  Well, that's a little bendable.  It's got to be...  Here we go.  A CD.  Yeah, he's got a CD.  Yeah, all right.  A CD. 
[01:33:00]  Hold on.  Go over there, Travis, where it's a clean wall so we can mark it.  Okay.  And that mark will be there long past you're gone.  Yeah, exactly.  And push his hair down.  Wait, he's leaning the head over the door.  Flatten your head.  Yeah, he's standing there straight.  Put your head back in so nobody opened the door, by the way.  Is that fair, Travis?  Well, make sure that you get him...  Get it level.  No, the lower.  Level it out.  Under the CD.  What's the iPhone?  Oh.  The little level app.  Yeah, and you've got to do it further.  There's a level app?  Yeah.  Do you want to level it? 
[01:33:30]  I think it's all right.  Is that a fair mark, sir?  Yeah, that's fair.  All right.  I think he's going to be...  All right, here it comes.  We're now tabulating.  He's not even close to 5'5".  Come on, please.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  A real man knows how to work a tape measure, Travis.  I don't know.  Dr. Gay.  Oh, Dr. Gay.  Jimmy will hold the tape measure at the floor.  Uh-oh.  Oh. 
[01:34:00]  5'5 1⁄2".  Yes.  Oh, damn.  Is that legal?  5'5 1⁄2".  Yeah.  And there's no way that half inch, you could even tilt the CD a little bit.  My money back?  I'm not even making it.  Is that my money back?  Oh, you got the 50 from Hope.  There you go.  Man.  You broke even.  How is that possible?  Plus, gambling's not allowed, though, by the way, in your internship.  How is that possible?  I thought you had him.  Yeah.  How is that possible?  Then you guys need to adjust your heights.  I'm a little taller than I thought.  I think so.  It looks like someone's a bigger boy than he thought. 
[01:34:30]  Yay, me.  Rob, you got lunch today.  I got lunch today.  Cool.  You just think, sure, since you didn't have a pool party.  Don't cancel the invite.  I still, just because Rob is a little taller than we thought, does not change the fact  that there's some odd text deletions that didn't happen.  That's fine.  And 5'5 1⁄2", is not 5'6", for the record.  Right, and 5'5 1⁄2", is not the issue.  All right, so I'll say 5'5 1⁄2", from now on.  Your height, or lack thereof, is not the issue.  He's lying about deleted texts.  He's lying about a Facebook.  That's the important stuff.  Oh, did he keep track of all the lies? 
[01:35:00]  God, we should have done that.  Well, so far, he's confirmed lies, is the cookies.  When they were baked.  Everything's a lie.  His parents not moving him in.  Remember?  Yeah, on Saturday.  They weren't going to be at the party.  The brother, yeah.  Parents at home.  Now, tell me, how many text messages were deleted that you were talking about the party?  Please.  Two.  Both different girls?  Yeah.  And both you were talking dirty, too? 
[01:35:30]  Yes.  Not a lie.  And neither one of them came over?  No.  So you had two girls that will talk dirty with you.  Because I was talking dirty with one of them, and I didn't, like, invite her back over afterwards.  After I canceled the party.  Right, so you canceled the party, you were talking dirty, and then just deleted all of it.  How long had you been talking dirty with one of them?  Wait, you got two girls on the hook, and you're not even trying to get them over to  your house?  For, like, two days.  So you've been talking two days.  Why would you have kept her on the phone if you were talking dirty?  Because it was just like, I was just done.  I didn't want it in my phone anymore.  I don't know. 
[01:36:00]  It's just...  But you want all those other ones in your phone.  Yeah.  My mom uses his phone.  Right.  His mom uses it when she's just...  How many times a week does your...  Her phone is in another place.  Yeah, how many times does your mom use your phone a week?  I don't know.  It's not like...  How many about?  It's like, if she forgets her phone...  About...  Twice?  Three times?  Not a lot.  It's not like she's using it every day.  Your mom uses your cell phone three times a week?  It's not like she's using it every day.  It's like...  She checks his phone.  That's more than my mother's used my phone.  If my father fucking grabbed his chest and fell, I wouldn't let my mother have my phone.  Because she'd do the same thing. 
[01:36:30]  That'd be a tough choice.  What does TS stand for?  Nothing.  Timeshare.  Timeshare.  That'd be a tough choice right there, huh, Jimmy?  Monster pictures.  Where does your mom use your phone?  That's Jimmy Sophie's choice.  Dad's dying.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Where does your mom use your phone?  If she forgets hers.  Were you even at that concert?  Okay, because before...  Before Rob said that he doesn't carry the phone around the house and says that his mom 
[01:37:00]  uses his cell phone in his house.  No, I didn't.  Hey, by the way, any calls on the record that your mom has made?  Any what?  What do you mean?  Like in the past calls and stuff.  I mean, that'd be like to my dad or something.  Nothing like...  Are you sure?  Just wondering.  Yes.  Maybe the guy in the white car.  Yeah, that white car.  Rob DeJesus writes, no girl passes on a chance at two fingers in the shitter. 
[01:37:30]  Two in the shitter while he's eating her pussy in front with his white toes, right?  Yeah, he's standing up because he's so slight of frame.  Oh, gee.  Not really.  If he's five, five and a half, something's wrong with that.  But whatever.  I lost.  I hate losing.  I don't know how much further we can actually go with this.  All right.  Um, I think we've exhausted all of our avenues.  I should have just had it.  You should have just kept it going.  I'm glad that Anthony didn't go to your house. 
[01:38:00]  He would have been in danger.  I am fucking...  And you wouldn't have been strapped?  No, that's just it, too.  No.  It's in Jersey.  I would have been defenseless.  Maybe.  Alone.  It's almost eight o'clock.  I'm sure someone's awake.  Yeah.  Yeah, Rob, there really is plenty of time here.  I mean, if on Saturday, 8.30 is when you're calling your friends.  Monday at eight o'clock is not unreasonable.  Absolutely.  Let's give one of them a call before we go to break.  I think that's fair.  One of the ladies.  Maybe one of the ladies you were offering to eat her pussy.  Yo, what's that, bitch?  What you doing? 
[01:38:30]  What you doing, bitch?  What are you doing?  Trolling through?  Trying to find a cooperative person?  Somebody that knows that you'll be able to...  Go to your last calls.  How about one of the dirty talking chicks?  Cold read.  We don't have to say what you...  Yeah, where's the dirty chick?  Yeah, how about one of these chicks that wants to get her butt fingered and...  It should be from Saturday, no?  Fucking...  Okay, he's...  Married dirtily.  He's scrolling through names that he called yesterday instead of Saturday.  Saturday.  That doesn't make sense.  All right, go to Saturday.  Let's do Saturday.  All right.  Who would you like me to call? 
[01:39:00]  Whoever you...  You tell us.  We don't know.  One of the hot chicks.  It's my mom.  Oh, that's funny.  Oh, God.  Let's see.  Who's there?  What's the name for his mom?  She calls her mom?  Woman.  Oh, woman.  I'm not seeing any...  Ladies.  Because I texted them.  We were texting.  I thought he uses the phone a lot.  Yeah, he said he doesn't text.  Except when he's offering to perform oral sex.  So you only texted two people about the party.  Both were girls that you were talking dirty to.  And both you deleted.  Do you understand how much bullshit that sounds like? 
[01:39:30]  That could be a problem.  That's an impossibility if that's the truth.  You know that's not entirely true.  It's not even kind of true.  I'm a guy who texts dirty.  Believe me.  I get that.  You don't erase those immediately.  So let's just call one of the girls or whatever, please.  We'll straighten this mess out and we'll be at break shortly.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Just tie up the loose ends and finish everything.  Who would you like me to call?  You, whichever one.  Call one of the girls you were dirty texting.  Yeah.  Call that one.  There's nothing wrong with that.  All right. 
[01:40:00]  I'm just going to watch it who you die on.  Okay.  Because you're not to be trusted.  You understand.  You don't trust Rob?  No.  He lies.  He lies.  He looks at his phone.  He's lying about a bunch of stuff.  A bunch of stuff.  Yeah.  He's not.  That's an understatement.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Why is it taking so long?  It's taking a really long time to find one.  Why don't you just scroll all the way left and Google search one of these? 
[01:40:30]  Like, not Google, but just go swipe left and call one of them.  Sam, what is he doing?  He's just scrolling through names, even though.  But when you know.  Yeah.  I told him to just call one of the girls that he dirty texts.  I'm just trying to delay it.  Why are you delaying?  Because I don't know.  Why are you delaying?  It's just.  Because it's not true.  Well, just ask it.  True.  So close.  Just get it out, man.  We'll just ask her if you were even texting with her.  That's all.  We won't even bring up the dirty text.  No, we won't bring up the dirty text.  We'll just ask what happened with Rob's party. 
[01:41:00]  What did you know about Rob's party?  Yeah.  When did you find out it was canceled?  And you were going to go.  What happened?  Okay.  And we'll let her speak for herself.  All right.  That's fine.  Okay.  That's a female name.  Okay.  Okay.  It's all good.  Okay.  All right.  Just to get to the bottom of things.  Just to straighten this mess out.  Yeah.  Did he take his shoes off?  He did.  Yeah, he did.  It's just going to run away. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  Come back, Rob.  Don't leave.  I don't want to.  Why?  Could you...  Is the phone even ringing right now?  Yeah.  Travis is saying no.  I can't hear it.  Anything?  Travis?  Oh.  Yeah.  Voicemail.  Voicemail.  Yeah.  He almost made it through, too.  Before we realize...  You know he's got four days left on his internship?  But you see what he just did?  He was so excited that finally something worked in his favor. 
[01:42:00]  The voicemail.  Voicemail.  See?  Told you, guys.  Told you, guys.  All confident.  I'm off the hook.  Say, look.  Yeah.  You believe me now?  But that's only one of the two girls, right?  Oh, call the other one.  Call the other girl.  Come on.  We'll call Trevisimo.  Yeah.  There are two girls.  Call the other one.  Call the other bitch.  We'll call one of your other friends, too.  I'm sure that there's somebody we can get on the phone.  Anyone?  People are asking, what is the purpose of all the lying?  I'm not sure.  We don't know.  That's why we're pursuing this.  I'm not really sure.  He's come up with some vagaries as far as... 
[01:42:30]  That's a he, though.  That's a he.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  One girl and you're out?  I'm thinking, like...  Why is he calling a he if there was another girl?  Call the other girl.  Because it's a lie.  It's a lie.  Who wouldn't want to talk to the other girl?  Yeah.  Because it's a lie.  Because we weren't even going to say the naughty text.  Remember?  We were just going to ask him about the pool party.  Oh, my God.  She was never invited.  No.  Or she never said yes.  Because he doesn't really know her.  Or she never existed.  Yep. 
[01:43:00]  Voicemail?  Another voicemail.  Okay.  Let's try it.  Let's try the other girl.  Let's give her a shot.  Yeah.  Why would you call the other girl?  No problemo.  Yeah.  No problemo.  Right.  Why wouldn't you call the other girl?  I don't want to.  Easy as pie.  Why wouldn't you want to call her?  It's just like...  We were texting this weekend.  Let me give you a ring of the ring.  Because all we would do is say, where are you texting with Rob?  And what do you know about this pool party?  How bad could that be?  If you're not lying.  Yeah.  Come on, man.  All right.  All right. 
[01:43:30]  Anything?  See?  Scrolling through names.  By the way, he already admitted that he didn't delete any texts before.  He actually did admit that.  So now he's back to saying he deleted them.  But before he did...  Yeah.  You did admit that, Rob.  You said, no, I didn't.  It was a lie.  You did admit that the text deleting was a lie.  And now you're back to it.  Then it was a lie.  All right.  What part of it, though?  We don't even know which part anymore.  The two texts.  Those didn't exist.  I sent out the invites on Facebook.  I canceled it on Saturday. 
[01:44:00]  All right.  Did the two texts exist?  No.  There were no dirty texts.  But I did...  A lot of people called, and not really that many...  No one texted.  So you just created a scenario?  A lot of people called you?  A lot of people called you?  Yeah.  For what?  For those inbound calls.  Yeah, let's see the inbound calls.  And why did they call you?  Why did all these people call you?  Why?  To see if...  Dude, I saw your Facebook.  To see if it was...  To double check.  How do you double check if something was canceled?  Did you answer every one, or did any of them leave you a message?  You couldn't have answered every call. 
[01:44:30]  He doesn't carry his phone.  All right.  Because mommy has it.  That's her naughty boy phone.  Yeah.  Because sometimes our phone is somewhere else.  Exactly.  As you so eloquently put it.  Let's see.  Okay.  He called.  Okay.  That's James.  Missed call from James.  That was my brother.  Okay.  That doesn't count.  Okay.  Mike.  Mike.  Mike.  Oh, Andrea.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  But now...  Okay.  That phone call is Eric.  So Eric is already quarter to three. 
[01:45:00]  You canceled at 11 a.m.  though.  Okay.  So how many calls did you get?  Everything after Eric is not party stuff.  No.  Yeah.  No.  No.  No.  Why would they call you that late?  You already deleted it from Facebook.  I've seen it.  And people are going back to Facebook saying it would be in his outbox.  It wouldn't.  It's not in the outbox.  It wasn't a message.  It was...  Oh, God.  It's fine.  Whatever.  I think we all know he's lying.  I just...  It's not fine.  I just don't...  It's weird.  We just want him to come out and give the whole truth and go, all right, look, I'm embarrassed.  But even when he said that, that wasn't true. 
[01:45:30]  I did say that.  I said I was embarrassed.  Not a lot of people were going to come.  And then you guys...  I didn't think you guys were going to come.  So why...  I don't know.  Why have it?  Do you have friends?  Yeah.  But they didn't want to go to your party?  Dude, when I was your age, if someone lived in a kick-ass house like that, I was going.  Absolutely.  Every time.  And even if the kid was the worst kid in school.  Right.  So why wouldn't they want to hang out at that house?  So wait, you...  Just on a Saturday afternoon, why wouldn't you just fucking want to hang out there? 
[01:46:00]  I don't know.  It was just...  I don't know.  I just didn't feel...  I hung out with kids I hated because they had great houses.  Yeah, great pool like that.  And pools and stuff.  They might have had a boat.  Whatever they had.  Yeah.  Yes, Travis.  No, no, no.  Don't worry about it.  I don't know.  You sure?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's fun.  Would anybody like a cookie?  I want it pretty soon.  Not anymore.  No?  I'm scared of everything.  They are good.  I wasn't going to have one anyway.  I'm just...  You look good.  Oh, I try. 
[01:46:30]  Are we done with this, I guess?  Finally?  I guess so.  I'm sorry, guys.  For lying?  For lying.  List the things you lied about.  Just so everything is copious.  Yeah, just come clean.  We like you, Rob.  I like you.  You're one of our favorite interns.  I like you.  Susan liked you.  I made the Facebook group.  No, list the things you lied about.  Yeah, not the things you did.  The things you lied about.  Don't do the positives, too.  Just the negatives.  Can I see what you think I lied about?  No.  No.  So then I can tell you.  No.  He doesn't even know what he lied about.  Just mention what you lied about.  That's pathological shit.  Exactly. 
[01:47:00]  That's exactly right.  That's crazy.  And that's why...  That's why...  He has built a life for himself because of whatever reason.  Yes.  And it's falling apart here.  Yeah, don't look at what Sam wrote is irrelevant.  He's over there having fun like he's hanging out at home.  I want to know...  Oh, I thought you said an elephant.  There's beer at my house.  There's beer at your house, Bob.  There's beer at my house.  I mean, there's like a 30 pack for 30 or 40 beers there.  Okay?  Wow.  For what reason?  It was...  I mean, it was already there, but it was for the party also.  It was already there.  Somebody at parents is an alcoholic. 
[01:47:30]  They have beer around the house.  No, it's just like...  Hence, mom using your phone.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, God.  We could build a new story for you, Rob.  Yeah.  She loses her phone in blackouts.  She doesn't remember where she left it.  No, she leaves it in cabs, motels.  I don't think there are 30 or 40 beers in that house.  It's fine.  I think there's like a 12 pack.  Like, it's just a normal...  How much beer is really in the house, Rob?  How much?  30 beers, yeah.  Why don't we call your mom?  We'll be...  We won't curse at every means.  We'll be very respectful. 
[01:48:00]  I won't be...  My mom always has a good time on the show.  Yeah, we even call her...  And you brought it...  We even call her a C-word and she goes with it.  Yeah, you brought in baked goods and my mom will get on the phone when she brings in  baked goods.  We promise we'll be nice to Rob.  I will...  I'll be nice to your mom.  I will not be rude to her or disrespectful.  Yeah.  Let's do it.  Let's call her.  I'd rather not.  I don't know.  Let's give her a call.  Let's get her on the horn.  I don't think she'll be awake.  I'll bet she will.  It's already 8 o'clock.  Wait, mom...  And we'll call the house phone anyway.  We'll wake her up.  Yeah, it's 7...  It's 8 o'clock. 
[01:48:30]  What else is she going to do today?  Exactly.  She has to go prepare for school.  Because she's a teacher.  What time does she start teaching?  What time does she prepare?  I don't know.  What school is in now?  No, she teaches at a parochial school.  Okay, a parochial school.  And they started?  No.  Not yet.  She has to go there and get her classroom ready.  So she'll be awake in the morning?  Yeah.  What?  She does...  No one with a teaching job ever sleeps past 8 o'clock.  And what does she have to do to get her classroom ready? 
[01:49:00]  I don't know.  She has to, like...  Sweep it up?  Like, put up posters and stuff like that.  Erase the bulletin board?  When does school start?  Put up fucking...  I don't know.  I think next week...  Jimi Hendrix posters.  Next week or two weeks?  So she's up...  She tears his posters down like Mark Wahlberg's mother in Boogie Nights.  That's what happened at the party.  Wait, so is she awake or not awake?  Because she has to go to the classroom.  She's not awake.  But she's sleeping because she has to do this?  Well, she's going to do it.  I mean, it's like...  Let's give her a call.  It doesn't take too long.  Give her a ring.  We won't curse. 
[01:49:30]  We won't be disrespectful.  We'll be very nice.  Let her know the old boy is safe.  I'd rather not.  Yeah.  Give her...  I just don't want to, please.  Yeah, no.  It's okay.  Oh, man.  I think he's embarrassed.  I'm embarrassed because my mom's just embarrassed.  Not embarrassing, but she's just...  Why is she embarrassing?  Tell us.  Come on, man.  She's just...  Why is she embarrassing?  I don't know.  She's just...  I don't know.  She's just...  She's like mom.  Like my mom.  Does she baby you?  What is it?  No, she doesn't really baby me a lot. 
[01:50:00]  She's more like my brother.  My older brother is like the favorite.  Oh.  She babies my little sister a lot.  Right.  But I don't know.  My dad...  I mean, I'm not saying I'm my favorite.  Like my dad's...  What is he saying?  So what are you saying?  I don't know.  How does she embarrass you?  This is all getting too confusing.  Let's get her on the phone.  No, no.  Let her continue.  How would she embarrass you?  Tell us.  It was like...  What is it?  What would your dad...  Your dad's... 
[01:50:30]  What?  I don't know.  I don't know where I was going with that one.  Well, you said you're not her favorite.  So what...  Understandable, obviously.  What exactly would she do that would embarrass you?  No, I don't know.  She'd say something on the air or something.  Like what?  Like what?  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  What's your pet name for you?  Virgin.  Liar.  Old Pinocchio.  At least you got a mom.  Oh, Travis. 
[01:51:00]  At least you got a mom.  Yeah, his ran off of some Jew.  What?  What?  What's your dad?  Nothing.  Yeah, what?  Nothing.  No, I don't know.  What?  White car?  No, he doesn't have a white car.  I'll bet he doesn't.  What?  I want to know what he's afraid of with his mom calling her.  What is happening?  How is she going to embarrass you?  She would just...  I don't know.  Yeah, she'd do it.  Yeah, it's just...  I don't know.  I mean, my mom does motherly stuff, and that's embarrassing, but it's cool. 
[01:51:30]  It's for the show.  Sam, let him be.  Just let him be.  Yeah, don't help him out.  Okay.  What would she do?  Come on.  Yeah.  I don't know.  She would...  I don't know.  She would what?  I don't know.  Come on.  I don't know.  What's the problem?  Nothing.  There's no problem.  What would she do?  Come on.  I'm not sure.  I don't know.  I don't know what she would do.  Is she a drinker?  Tell us how you know that you're not the favorite.  Go ahead.  Tell us how you know that in your mom's eyes you're not the favorite.  Go ahead.  Um, hmm, well, she used to drug test me. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, she did.  Yes, she did.  Why would she drug test you?  Would she think that no sober son would tell lies of this proportion?  No, they caught me smoking weed.  Oh, boy.  Are you babied by mommy, or what is exactly?  He's a middle child.  There's something weird there, because she uses his phone.  He has her as woman in his phone.  It's just like, oh, that's just a little goof, I guess.  Is that a goof, woman? 
[01:52:30]  Oof.  That's creepy.  That's weird.  Isn't it?  That's incestuous.  Yeah.  Sexual.  Do you guys flirt?  No.  Does she still give you baths?  Wash that dirty pee-pee.  She's like Barbara Streisand's parents in nuts.  If your father's slipping money under the door.  She's 12.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I just wish you would list the things you lied about, and we can wrap this up. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, because people are, they've had us.  All right, they're done.  They really have had us.  We apologize.  They liked it for a while, but now they're like, what?  I'm sorry, guys.  Yeah, list the lies really fast.  All right.  It'll, um, there are not that many, but there's a couple hot dogs and hamburgers.  A couple.  How many?  They weren't bought for the party.  All right.  They weren't bought for the party.  Oh, man.  They would have been used for the party.  Right.  So the beer wasn't bought for the party either. 
[01:53:30]  They both were already there.  That's just shit you have in your house.  So you had a party, and you hadn't bought anything by 9 a.m. for the party?  Would we have had to share hot dogs and hamburgers?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  I would have got stuff.  No, no.  When were you going to get stuff?  When were you supposed to get it beforehand?  That morning, and then I just decided to cancel it, because no one was really going to come.  It was just like, whatever.  Nobody doesn't buy hot dogs and hamburgers before the party.  You're planning a party.  I would have.  You put out a Facebook thing.  You would think, like, you'd be excited.  There's an A&P around my house. 
[01:54:00]  Why do I have to go, like, three days in advance?  Why can't I just go?  That was the day before.  Yeah, nobody wants to, like, prepare for a party the morning of.  But it is a possibility.  Okay.  I mean, I'm 21.  Like, what?  We know, young.  But there was no party, so let's start there.  There was a party.  The cookies were not made for the party.  So the cookies, the beer, and the hamburgers and hot dogs were not made for the party.  Not made for the party.  Okay.  More of the lies.  But he brought the cookies in today.  Well, because my mom-  Because he knew this shit was weird.  No, it wasn't that at all.  So this was a distraction.  I know this shit, asshole. 
[01:54:30]  Well, it was my life.  Wow.  You brought it-  And I didn't mean to call you an asshole.  It's okay.  But you brought the cookies in as a distraction.  No.  Like, my mom was going to make cookies.  I'm telling you.  My mom was going to make cookies Saturday.  But then I came home last night, and she's like, oh, I made you cookies.  Last night, when I left, I went, how weird is that?  Does your dad do radio?  No.  Is he on radio?  No. 
[01:55:00]  Came home for a guy.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Why is someone saying my dad is on the radio?  Oh.  Fucking-  Have people had enough of this?  Oh, yeah.  They did.  Yeah.  They've had their filth.  Well, Rob, to be fair, yes, they have.  They're just saying.  But they're creeped out.  Do you want me to leave the cookies here?  You know, I got to say this.  Not one person that is buying it.  It's fine.  Whatever.  I mean, not even one.  You didn't finish listing the lies.  And then we can wrap up. 
[01:55:30]  It wasn't all because of the weather.  That's another one.  What was it because of that?  Because not a lot of people are going to come.  It's like, I don't know.  But why wouldn't they go?  Nice house.  Nice pool party.  Oh, my God.  Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy.  Sounds like an amazing fucking day for everybody.  He's not very popular.  No.  He wants to be a little more popular. 
[01:56:00]  I have more friends at school than I do at home.  Understandable.  More friends at school.  Well, because they can't check on his lies.  Right, right.  Too busy this party.  Yeah, yeah.  What are the other lies?  Don't believe anything.  What the fuck?  Hot dogs and hamburgers were a lie.  The beer was a lie.  The cookies were a lie.  The deleted text messages were a lie.  The weather was a lie.  It was a 50% minimum lie.  Minimum.  What else?  Oh, that's it.  Those are...  That's it.  Does your mom use your phone?  Yeah.  She has.  She does. 
[01:56:30]  Three times a week?  Has she ever taken it into the bathroom  and then you heard the camera click  and she sent a picture?  And then deleted it?  How many times a week does she use her phone?  Two to three times, maybe.  Three times a week with that.  So that might not be a lie, finally.  It depends, like, where I am.  If I'm out with her or, like, say,  hey, we're by the pool and she's like,  oh, can I just use your phone?  Yeah, whatever.  Sure.  You and your mom hanging by the pool?  Yeah.  You're calling her a woman?  Hey, woman.  My whole family hanging by the pool.  Oh, okay. 
[01:57:00]  So she would always ask for your phone.  Sure, I understand that.  Because it's, like, right there.  I think she checks his phone  because they thought he was doing drugs.  And then she probably just checks his phone  and she probably reads his text messages.  Your dad's not a lawyer?  No.  When a house like that, he does insurance?  He owns an insurance brokerage.  Oh, okay.  I don't know why the rates are so high.  Got to fucking buy those houses for people  and pools and whatnot.  Oh, yeah?  Yes, indeed.  All right.  He's a good man.  I'm not saying he's the rightist.  I'm not saying he's the rightist.  Stephen S. from Bayshore, 
[01:57:30]  this guy makes Bobo look like a great party maker.  Oh, fuck.  BoboQ.  Was that a hit?  Was that a hit?  It was a total zero.  Who showed up for him?  No one.  No one went.  Did he think, where was it?  At the...  But at least he held it.  At his backyard.  At least he tried to hold it.  No, that was another party that was rescheduled.  Oh, really?  Yeah, just like Rob's.  When did he realize no one was coming to his barbecue?  I think the day.  Rob, are you rescheduling this party?  Would you like me to?  So that's a lie, too. 
[01:58:00]  There's no rescheduling.  I mean, I'll have it, but it's like,  if no one's going to come...  But you weren't planning on this.  I was.  I was planning on it.  Because everyone's going back to school.  I don't know.  Wait, so the party's on for Saturday?  Yes.  Aren't you going back to school Saturday?  On Sunday.  He did say Sunday.  Okay.  Look, he looks like C.  That's the second non-lie.  I don't know. 
[01:58:30]  Wow.  I brought a bag for you.  Nah, I can't have those cookies.  There's no fucking way.  Okay.  But tell us, thank you.  Okay.  I just don't know what you did with the cookies on the way in.  I didn't do anything.  They were rapidly...  Probably rubbed them up your asshole or something.  I don't know.  Who knows?  Those chocolate chips.  What do you think those are?  What's that?  Oh, he wasn't talking to me.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  All right, Rob.  All right.  Pretty good. 
[01:59:00]  Thank you.  There you go.  He's walking away now.  Out the door.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pants are on fire.  Get it?  Yeah, send it to the Navy.  Oh.  Oh, wrong.  That's creepy.  That all started because Ed said, you know, you were thinking of going.  I was going to go.  And it just...  Even then, it didn't quite wash.  Something was wrong.  Something was weird because there was just no way to really get the info. 
[01:59:30]  It was weird that, like, I didn't hear anything.  No one heard anything about the party.  He couldn't get in...  Sam couldn't get in touch with him.  It was just too...  Something odd there.  I thought he was just going to get made fun of for being a jerk-off who missed having  an aunt at the party.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then he started talking and it was just, what?  Who knew this would unfold to be this bizarre?  Yeah.  He's just been here for months.  Lurking.  Journaling and collecting evidence.  Yeah. 
[02:00:00]  Collecting hair samples.  Uh-huh.  No.  It's creepy.  A little creepy.  A little creepy.  Just a little creepy.  All right.  Well, there you go.  I don't know.  That wasn't supposed to be two hours.  Trust me.  No.  It just kept building.  Oh, no.  It was...  No.  It was good in general.  Yeah.  It was all based on just a casual comment from a head.  I just...  And it just got stranger and stranger.  Look, I just enjoy the shit out of a good social experiment. 
[02:00:30]  And to me, that was great.  He sat there at first.  You know, you listen to him just talking all confidently about, this is what happened.  I did this.  And by the end, he's like, I don't know why it was that.  I think it was.  He's fucking tripping all over himself.  It's like, it just really is a great example of the interrogation process and how it just wears somebody down.  I find that shit fun and cool to be part of.  Cigars and Scotch, Peter Brady had a better party.  Yeah.  Peter Brady.  I remember when he kept running from room to room. 
[02:01:00]  You're not mechanically inclined, Peter.  Peter.  That's up there with Eyepatch Kid, which goes way back.  Pretty good.  We got a lot of new listeners.  We had an intern.  Eyepatch Kid even had a reason.  He like blew off the show a few days and then he came back with an eyepatch on and he basically said he was in a massive accident.  Did a motorcycle hit his car or something?  Yeah, he said that.  A motorcycle guy hit his car.  Can we play that later today?  E-Rock.  Yeah, we're cutting it up for later.  Yeah, cut it up for the 10 o'clock hour and then he got into an accident and the glass went in his eye. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, and then we just hammered him, hammered him like, look, just take the eyepatch off.  And then he like, he took it off really slowly and then started pointing at his eye like, see, see?  Yeah.  He was like closing his eye real tight like there was a problem with it.  And then we made him open his eye and it was perfectly normal.  Not even a scratch.  He did admit it too, right?  Yeah.  He went through the trouble of coming in to work with an eyepatch.  With an eyepatch.  And he had nothing under it. 
[02:02:00]  It was such a lie.  We broke him down.  What did we break him down?  We got him.  Nah, right, well.  All right, well, I guess we'll take a break and we got plenty of other things.  I'll tell you what I did in the stead of his party.  Oh, good.  I'd like to know.  Yeah.  And we lost two people over the weekend.  Oh, where are they?  Well, we got another Dr. Drew success story we're going to have to get into.  Yeah.  That Dr. Drew.  And another guy, so. 
[02:02:30]  All right.  All right.  The OPN Detail on Sirius XM.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now.  Because here comes Uncle Paul.  You should have had to make a big boy love you.  In today's episode, Uncle Paul tells us about his deep, dear friend, Jerry Zandusky. 
[02:03:00]  My friend Jerry's in trouble.  We used to get together and play the old frickle frackle.  Yeah, that's where you put, like, all the soapy suds on your penis.  And you move your hips like a hula hoop.  And then you slap the cheek while the water's splashing.  Sure, and the suds are flying off his cheek and everybody's laughing.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare. 
[02:03:30]  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now.  Because here comes Uncle Paul.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Fuck you.  Yeah, this fuck you goes out to your call screener.  I call for an hour and I get him finally and he says, I can't hear you.  Fuck you.  Can you hear me now, asshole?  Oh, and Sam, you suck. 
[02:04:00]  Fuck you.  Hey, hey, what do you say?  Give me a fuck you, Jim Norton.  Fuck you.

Uh, this fuck you goes out to the asshole that picks his nose at the urinal and wipes  it on the wall and I gotta look at it.  You douche nozzle.  Don't fuck yourself.  Fuck you. 
[02:04:30]  Hey, this fuck you goes out to Anthony.  I can't meet a guy named Mike or Bill without going, Mike or, hello, Bill.  Fuck you, Anthony.  It's making me awkward in public.  Fuck you.

I want to give a big fuck you to take us out, Chip. 
[02:05:00]  I fucking hate you.  You're awful and despicable.  It's just down right in.  Fuck you.  Take us out, Chip.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I want to give a big F you to my roommate who uses my laptop, and I found a jizz rag right  next to my laptop.  F you, man.  If you're going to use my laptop, please don't leave your t-shirt next to it.  Thanks.  Fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony F you line. 
[02:05:30]  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Hey, now, this is D.L. Hugh Glee.  Hey, this is Brewery.  Hey, everybody.  It's Joel McHale.  Hi, this is Jim Jeffries.  Hey, this is Jimmy Fallon.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Hey, this is Jimmy Fallon.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  All right.  We got a thus then.  We like thus thens on the Opie and Anthony show.  I swear we'll make this quick. 
[02:06:00]  We got to go back to Rob's pool party for a second.  I got a tweet from, you should get credit.  Bill Tetley.  Bill Tetley.  MWRev88.  And he brings up something we forgot about because, you know, we like to make believe,  but we're older guys.  And we have forgotten some shit.  He writes, he was going to, can he hear us?  Who knows?  No?  Okay.  Where is he?  I think he went to get breakfast or something. 
[02:06:30]  He's not in here.  Make sure he's not in the office.  Wait, he's coming down the hall.  I don't want him to hear this.  He's right there.  Okay.  Hang on.  He was going to throw a party because, because I feel like there was a party that was a possibility.  I do believe that much.  Okay.  He was going to throw a party knowing his parents were going to be away, moving his brother.  Then canceled when the parents changed their mind and decided, you know what?  We'll just move him in on Sunday.  On Sunday. 
[02:07:00]  So that leaves him going, fuck, now my parents are home on Saturday.  Blows the whole party thing.  So now I'm screwed.  This is a perfect way.  We've looked over all the evidence and this is exactly perfect explanation.  We are older gentlemen, but we forgot the days where you would throw parties when your parents would leave.  Parents were leaving.  And that would bring a lot of this together.  Right.  Here's the stuff it brings together.  Why there was nothing bought for the party.  No beer.  That beer was just beer that he has in his house.  Get up for a party when your parents are there. 
[02:07:30]  But as soon as that fucking car leaves, you're like, okay, they are definitely not turning.  Let's run to the A&P.  And sometimes you would wait maybe a half hour in case they forgot something.  Yeah.  But as soon as you know for sure they are gone, then you make, I forgot all this shit.  Yeah.  You make all the phone calls.  All right, you go get the beer.  All right, we need hot dogs.  We need hamburgers.  What else do we need for this fucking party?  And you get it all together the last fucking minute.  Thus then why he was deleting text messages because his mom does use his phone on a regular basis.  Thus then why he didn't want us to get his mom on the phone. 
[02:08:00]  Did you hear him panic and have a breakdown?  Yes.  Because what we would have heard there was, Rob, you were going to have a party this weekend?  You were going to have a party?  What?  And then that would prove to us, like, see, Rob, you were lying the whole time.  But then he would have to say, well, guys, I was in line.  I was going to do it behind their fucking back.  Exactly.  Should we, when he comes in, should we pretend that we have her on hold?  Say, we got your mother on hold.  And say, like, apparently. 
[02:08:30]  Wait, how good is this?  Yeah.  I understand what Jimmy's saying.  Can he hear us?  Because this will fuck it up.  No.  No.  All right.  We're going to go, Rob.  I apologize.  You were right.  You were going to have a party.  And I go, see, I told you guys.  And we also know why you didn't have a party.  Your parents changed their plans.  This was going to be a party where you were going to do it behind their back.  Yeah.  But how do we do that?  How do we know that that is the truth now? 
[02:09:00]  We don't.  Somebody ratted him out.  Don't want to say who, but someone ratted him out.  Mm-hmm.  Someone close to you, Rob, ratted you out and tweeted something.  Right.  Okay?  All right.  Well, not tweeted.  No, said something.  Said something.  All right.  Yeah.  Make it fucking vague.  But then everything else sort of makes sense.  Yeah.  Maybe we're right.  Let's just take a shot at it.  I think we're right.  All right.  Bring Rob in here.  That's right.  We're right.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  People are losing their minds.  Are they annoyed? 
[02:09:30]  Oh, they are so annoyed.  Rob.  Give some fuck.  It's our show.  Follow me.  Yes.  Got some info during the break.  Yes.  What's that?  Well, you were going to have a party.  Mm-hmm.  Thank you.  See his eyes get wide?  Yeah.  I mean, I told you.  Holy shit.  Who said that?  But you want to say what happened or you want us to say it?  Who called in?  I got, we got info.  Really good info. 
[02:10:00]  Mm-hmm.  Oh, yeah?  So you were going to have a party.  Mm-hmm.  Tell us what happened.  You know, the show does get out to people that do hear things.  And it's, uh, and, you know.  Good source.  People close to you actually are fans of the show.  Yeah.  Is it my cousin?  It doesn't matter who it was, but let's just say.  What was the issue?  Uh, nothing.  Uh, I don't know.  Nothing.  I don't know.  Um.  We do know, though.  So what?  So, well, why don't you tell me?  Because I clearly don't know. 
[02:10:30]  You don't want to say?  I don't know.  What was it?  Why don't you tell us?  Tell us, Rob.  I don't know what you want me to tell you.  You were going to have a party, but what happened?  Might be a little embarrassing.  Uh.  We've been there.  Not a lot of people are going to come?  Nope.  When did your parents change their plans?  Just curious.  When did that happen?  Um.  That Saturday to Sunday thing. 
[02:11:00]  Mm-hmm.  Moving your brother.  When did that happen?  Saturday.  Saturday they decided, ah, let's do this tomorrow.  No.  Saturday we moved my brother.  We helped him move.  No.  When did they decide to not do it Sunday?  Right, right.  When did they decide?  What?  Wait, what?  Wait, no.  Forget it.  You know what?  The listeners are right for you.  Wait, wait, wait.  What did he forget it?  You said they did it Saturday.  You said they put it off to Sunday.  That was a lie?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Forget it.  What happened?  Just go. 
[02:11:30]  Seriously, just go.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  But you said.  Hold on.  No, I have to know.  You just said that you did it Sunday.  Saturday you said you did nothing.  Saturday I helped move my brother in.  But you said that you went drinking with your brother.  I did afterwards.  But you said that he didn't move until Sunday.  Well, he moved Saturday.  Well, why would he move Saturday if you were having a party?  Because I didn't.  I forgot he was moving.  I mean, I knew, but I didn't know that I needed to help.  And then, like, I don't know.  I just thought it would end a lot earlier than it did. 
[02:12:00]  And then what time do you think it would end?  Nine in the morning?  So you're saying this is why you canceled the party also?  Pretty much, yeah.  Wait, what happened?  Tell the truth, you associate pants.  Holy shit, forget it.  I have to know now because.  Yeah, I helped my brother.  I helped move my brother in on Saturday.  You just before said Sunday.  Yeah, I know.  I apologize to everyone.  I apologize to everyone.  That's like pretty much the only reason.  Weather was pending to.  Okay, but you said it took a lot later.  It was a lot later than you thought.  Yeah, I thought, like, hey, we'd be done by, like, you know, 2.30. 
[02:12:30]  8 in the morning?  No, like 2.33-ish.  And then it took us all day.  But how are you going to.  All right.  I know they're going to kill us.  Let them kill us.  But how would you fucking get the party together?  I don't know.  If you figured it would be done by 3 and you had nothing bought for the party yet.  Because I let you off the hook saying that you could get all this shit for a pool party last minute.  I mean, I'm 20.  But if you know you're already busy.  It's not that hard.  Hot dogs, hamburgers, beer.  At 3 in the afternoon, you're going to get all that stuff? 
[02:13:00]  It's so easy.  You just run to the store and get it.  I'm out.  This got way weirder.  But it did, right?  This is, like, freaking me out.  So now you moved your brother on Saturday.  Because we finally had it figured out.  But now, like Sam said, it's way weirder.  You just threw a complete monkey wrench into everything.  You absolutely.  Like, the whole basis.  You said that originally you were going to move him Saturday.  But then it got moved.  The parents were going to help him move Sunday.  But now you're saying you moved him Saturday. 
[02:13:30]  All right.  Here's what happened.  Why did you lie?  Just talk about it.  On, like, Friday, he was like, hey, I need help moving tomorrow.  And I didn't know.  I was like, all right, whatever.  Like, so I went to his apartment where he used to live in Montclair.  I slept over there.  You know, we, and then that morning we loaded everything into a U-Haul truck, which took, like, six hours.  And then when we moved him to, like, my town, I thought, like, we'd be done by, like, three-ish. 
[02:14:00]  Then I could still, you know, grab, just quickly go to supermarket, grab some food.  145?  I put three.  I have no fucking idea.  So, wait, you started moving him in the morning and canceled the party at nine.  Or what time did you cancel the party?  Like, pretty much around, like, 1230-ish.  Now it's 1230.  What?  The timeline is just...  It's like, it's not...  11, 1230?  It's just things didn't go the way I thought they would go.  Does that make sense? 
[02:14:30]  No!  Does that make sense?  No.  I'm sorry.  I don't know what to do.  We had it figured out.  We had it figured out.  But then, like Sam said, this made it way weirder.  Doesn't matter.  Way the fuck weirder.  There's no reason you would have to move your brother on Saturday if you're having a pool party.  You would just say, look, obviously we're having that pool party, idiot.  I'll move you Sunday.  Well, his friends were supposed to come help him out.  How come you didn't tell us that?  Why did you say you moved you on Sunday? 
[02:15:00]  Why didn't you just tell us that?  That's a bunch of lies.  And how are we supposed to believe this?  I don't even know what's real anymore.  You're right.  He's compulsive.  It's pathological.  Yeah, you're a pathological liar.  You might need a little help.  You think so?  Yeah, you're not a bad guy, but you're a pathological liar.  I don't think you moved your brother Saturday.  I don't know.  I have no idea, to be honest.  I don't know what's real anymore.  Like Sam said, it got real.  That's way weirder.  All right.  I did not see that coming.  No.  No.  I was left field right there.  Oh. 
[02:15:30]  All right.  You are a little freak.  Different.  No, you're not different.  It's just, you're lying unnecessarily.  Yeah, there's really no reason for this.  These are not necessary lies, Rob.  We don't care.  No reason.  No, it's just like, you guys are huge.  I just want to talk to you.  No, we're really not.  No, we're not.  We used to be really big.  We're clinging to mediocrity by our fingernails.  Right.  We'll acknowledge.  And who cares?  Like, regardless of how you think, your perception of us, why would you say, ah, there's a party, 
[02:16:00]  and I had to help my brother move.  You're 21.  It's not like you're 50, helping your brother move across town.  And, you know.  Yeah.  Were you going to have a party behind your parents' back?  No.  Well, a little bit.  Kind of.  I mean, like, a little bit.  Like, I was going to make it, I made it, I downplayed it a little bit to them, and then  I wanted it a lot bigger.  And that's why you didn't buy a bunch of stuff until they were going to be gone on Saturday.  Yeah.  You thought your parents were going to be gone Saturday.  No.  I mean, I knew they were going to be around, but they weren't like, I thought they would 
[02:16:30]  help out.  I knew my mom wasn't going to be there.  You had told us they were going to be gone Saturday.  I knew my mom wasn't going to be there, and I thought my dad would be helping out.  She had a bridal shower.  By the way, you...  Wait, but she was supposed to move your brother.  Yeah, and your dad was playing golf, or he was helping move your brother.  What was she doing?  My dad was playing golf while...  So you had to help...  My dad was playing golf while I was helping him in Montclair load all his stuff together.  And how was your mom going to make the cookies?  How important is golf to your dad that he doesn't move your brother?  He could play golf any day. 
[02:17:00]  Because he didn't think it was, I don't know, that long-ish?  I guess he didn't think we really needed the help.  But as a family, you would realize, because you said this, that his friends blew him off,  so he needs help to move.  So why would it just be you and not your dad going, well, I can play golf.  He helped afterwards, and when we were at the house, he helped unload the U-Haul and  everything like that.  And your mom was where?  She had a bridal shower.  Where did your brother move to?  My town.  Where?  Your house?  No.  Right down the street, like five minutes away.  Okay.  So you're... 
[02:17:30]  But he helps the U-Haul at your house?  No, at his house.  At my brother's house.  His brother's new house.  He's saying his dad showed up and helped unload the truck.  Yeah, he helped.  I understand that.  After he played golf.  After golf.  And your mom wasn't going to be at the party, but she was going to make cookies.  This bridal shower is the first time we're hearing a bridal shower.  I didn't know she was going to a bridal shower until, like, Friday.  I didn't...  Well, wouldn't you be talking about the pool party? 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  That she was making cookies for Sunday night?  I don't know.  For the Saturday pool party?  You lost me.  I'm lost now.  That's why you just got to fucking vomit the truth out.  Yeah.  I know.  I know.  I messed up.  I'm sorry, guys.  Don't be the sheepish I'm sorry.  We're not still messing up.  You know how old we are?  You can take that shit and shove it up your ass.  Yeah, dude.  That sheepish shit.  Yeah, the whole, like, I'm sorry, guys.  That works on, like, 20-year-old girls.  Right.  I'm fucking 45-year-old men. 
[02:18:30]  All right, I'm sorry.  That's better.  All right.  Wow.  Geez.  Well, don't say geez.  I'm sorry.  Oh, geez.  Oh, geez.  Oh, hello, Anthony.  Yeah, it's the party.  Anthony, hi.  It's the party.  Oh, Anthony, it's the party.  Rob knows what that's from, right?  Farmer.  Very good.  Yes, yes.  His eyes got big.  Wow, man.  His eyes get big when he's telling the truth.  It's weird.  All right.  All right.  Well, it just got weird.  It got a little weird. 
[02:19:00]  Well, at least the listeners are happy we went back to it.  Yeah, yeah.  Thank God.  Another couple hours of this and we go home.  Woo.  Yeah.  I've been getting...  I've sure have exhausted a lot of the show.  Huh?  I've been getting a little beating on Twitter.  Have you?  Yeah.  Like a little one.  Why?  The Robert Bobbert...  What's the number?  Robert Bobbert 05.  But he did that to get his Twitter plug in.  No.  Oh, my God.  I bet you there was one person that remembered his Twitter.  There wasn't just one person.  What?  I got like 12 new followers.  What are they saying on Robert Bobbert 05? 
[02:19:30]  The name is enragingly terrible.  It really is.  Why the 05?  Yeah, was it Robert Bobbert?  Someone else had Robert Bobbert?  It's just my lucky number.  It's 5's my favorite number.  What's lucky about it?  It's just my favorite number.  That's his height.  It's 5'5".  He's even lying about this because then you would just put 5.  It was...  I don't know.  Why 05?  It was 05 because someone had, I think, someone had 5 at the time.  Who was Robert Bobbert?  5.  Robert Bobbert.  Who was Robert Bobbert? 
[02:20:00]  Do you think he just lies about things?  All the time.  For no reason.  You don't need to do that.  For no reason.  For no reason.  You're a nice dude, Rob.  You don't need to do that shit.  It's so weird.  Lying is so weird when you don't have to.  I apologize.  Like, believe me.  I've told my sheriff, Phipps.  Sure.  Oh boy.  Some, as they say, whoppers.  Yeah.  Some doozies.  Some lulus.  But there was always a reason.  I don't think I've ever lied for no apparent reason whatsoever.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:20:30]  Robert Bobbert.  Two and a half fucking hours because an intern didn't have a pool party.  Should have called out for worst of.  Oh boy.  No, it's two and a half hours because there was a lot to this two and a half hours.  We don't care as much about the party as when you catch somebody lying and you're watching  their story unravel.  It's bizarre.  It's amazing.  Exactly.  You dummy.  Robert Bobbert 5 doesn't exist.  Okay.  So that's another lie.  So you could have had Robert Bobbert 5.  I don't know.  05.  I don't really remember at the time why I chose 05. 
[02:21:00]  Why did you say that?  Don't make up an excuse.  I had Robert Bobbert, but the guy had a car accident.  I gave it like, what?  You would just say 5 if it's your favorite number.  It's my favorite number.  Mine too.  You know how many times I stopped breathing in the last two and a half hours?  I know.  It's like I hold my breath because it's so weird.  Just waiting.  Yeah.  Well, well.  Well, Zeus just writes, well, that was a fucking annoying ride to work. 
[02:21:30]  Sorry.  There you go.  Sorry, Zeus Lizard.  How's that drive?  In Connecticut.  All right, Robert.  It's got weirder.  We thought we had this whole thing figured out, but it just got strange.  Well, we did.  I was like, God, that makes perfect sense.  That's got to be it.  Why didn't you want your mom on the phone?  I don't know.  It's just my mom.  I just don't like it.  Because she didn't know you were having a party?  Kind of.  Pretty much, yeah.  But you said she did know you were having a party.  I told her.  But it was going to be more.  It was going to be.  What makes it more?  I don't know.  Just like more people and stuff. 
[02:22:00]  She didn't know you were going to get back here.  You invited 12 people.  How the hell?  I don't know.  What, are we going to have two people and you got the number up to 12?  He probably told him I have a couple of friends over to go swimming.  I didn't know.  It was just big people.  Well, I said, like, I invited the staff and everything like that.  And then, I don't know.  I don't know.  All right.  Well, may I leave?  Oh, shit.  We were tortured.  All right.  I'll see you guys. 
[02:22:30]  All right, Robin.  Stop with the sheepish.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, enough of that shit.  How bad do you want to just leave the building right now?  There he goes.  You want to leave the building?  You can.  No, it's fine.  I just wish we fucking found this weird shit out about you like five weeks ago.  I know.  It's too bad you only have like a few days left here.  Yeah, only four more days.  I'm so glad he was exposed before he left, though.  Like, imagine if we would have thought, wow, that guy was...  Remember Rob, the entire...  People should be more like him.  We finally had a normal one.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:23:00]  I have normal ones.  And we find out right before he leaves, he's the most psychopathic guy out of all of them.  Exactly.  Do you have a fake cast in a fucking van, too?  It's one of those polarizing shows, because then other people say best two and a half hours ever.  See, that's what it is.  But it's really, you either love it or hate it.  I get it.  I am...  I don't know.  Whatever.  All right, Rob.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Whatever.  There's nothing else I can do right now.  There really is.  It's over.  I think you're right.  Yeah.  All right, so...  Did you get our food already?  Oh, boy.  No.  What did you want?  No, I mean, everyone got their food? 
[02:23:30]  Oh.  You could take the day off if you wanted.  Yeah, it's fine.  All right.  I love this place.  I mean, not this place, but, like, working for you guys.  It's awesome.  All right, buddy.  All right, Rob.  There he goes, Rob, the intern, who we thought was perfect.  We thought...  We thought the only thing...  We would have continued to leave.  We thought the only thing wrong with him was his webbed toes, and wow, were we wrong.  Boy, the luster really got knocked off of him.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God, did it ever.  That's not a shiny coin anymore, Jimmy. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, have you ever seen anybody lose their shine so fastly?  So fast?  So fastly.  So fastly.  Dirtily.  Dirtily.  Naughty dirtily.  It's naughty dirtily.  Esquire.  That's not a coin you're going to add to your collection anytime soon?  No, not at all.  That's a dirty one.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, you know, he's a good boy.  I still like him.  So hard to...  I still like him, even though he's...  Keep tabs of all those lies.  I just didn't like his...  I'm sorry.  It's like, I'm not a chick.  But compulsive liars are weird people, man. 
[02:24:30]  You believe some of that shit, right?  Pathological liars, like, for no reason.  I see if you get caught doing something and you're covering up, but, like, literally just  a fucking lie for no...  That's such a bizarre quality.  It is crazy.  And when we're close friends with people like that, we always avoid their lies.  It's, like, uncomfortable to call them on everything.  Yes.  Because some of them are genuinely likable, and you're like, I don't want to just keep  calling you on the fact that you're full of shit.  And why does he...  Yeah.  Why can't he even answer the question, why 05?  It's just...  Like, it's so weird. 
[02:25:00]  Everything is weird.  Why can't he just...  Well, that's how I did my numbers, or that was my jersey, and they had a 05, instead of  just a 5, and that's how I remember it.  Like, he doesn't even have an answer for that stuff.  He's like, I was taking it.  Oh, my God.  Our apologies to the listeners.  Ha, ha.  I'd like to apologize.  Yes.  We owe them for this one.  Yeah.  Sam, you call it.  It just got a lot weirder.  I really didn't see that coming.  I thought it was going to be like...  What part?  I thought it was going to be like, okay, you got it. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, my parents didn't know what was happening.  But then when he said, yeah, I moved my brother in on Saturday, it was like, why would you  have lied about that?  Yep.  Why is that the admission?  And then his mom had a bridal shower the whole time, and the father's playing golf, and he's  moving the son.  Someone on Twitter said Rob's parents shut down the party.  That's what we're saying.  Yes.  That was my whole point.  Yeah.  To either shut down the party, or they know what was happening, and they changed their  plans.  Tonight on Eyewitness News, fans of a popular radio show commit suicide in droves after a 
[02:26:00]  bit that would never end.  Fair enough.  Mass suicide?  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we're behind.  Way behind in breaks.  We'll take another break.  We'll get into what Ant did instead of going to the pool party.  Wow.  I guess I could talk about my skin tag operation I heard about.  I know.  I hope you're okay.  Jesus.  I want to know more about that, because I got a few tweets.  Did they talk about your three-inch scrotal skin tag? 
[02:26:30]  They sure did.  And, yeah, Dr. Drew's success story and other things.  So, we will move on, finally, unless something weird happens during this break.  I hope not.  We will move on.  You know, I know I'm not the only one who has ever looked down at my limb penis and began  punching it angrily, screaming, why, why? 
[02:27:00]  I'm not the only one to ever punch his penis like LaMotta hitting that wall at the end of  Raging Bull.  Why, dummy, dummy, dummy, dummy?  Why does that happen to my penis?  Why does it humiliate me?  Why does it go, why does my penis nosedive?  I'll tell you why.  Because sometimes I'm sick and tired of banging the same person.  And by that, I mean the second time I fuck her.  How many times can you fuck the same woman before your dick finally, that's the pow sign 
[02:27:30]  coming out of your dick.  You're trying to come, and a little flag is coming out.  But it's not saying pow, it's saying, enough!  Your dick is telling you, your body is talking to you.  If your heart murmurs, you go to the doctor.  If your dick just lays like a fucking, like a, like a salted slug on your thigh, it's  time to go out and find some new box, as my grandmother used to say.  Introduce your penis to some new pussy, you silly geese.  Then all of a sudden, you're banging like you're back in high school. 
[02:28:00]  Where's the best place to find new pussy?  Obviously, a woman's locker room.  If you're like me, you can put on a wig, so you look like Mrs. Doubtfire, and then you  walk in and you go, tee hee hee, dearie, tee hee hee, and then you yank out your butt  and you pull it.  But if you don't have access to a locker room, go to ashleymadison.com.  There's over 14 million members.  That's a lot.  It's not as good as 15 million, but it's a shitload better than 13 million.  It's filled with women in sexless marriages, many of them just like you. 
[02:28:30]  They're not looking for anything but a good lay.  They don't want to get in your life.  They want to get in your underpants.  I know it sounds too good to be true.  That's how men have been trained.  Anytime we think a girl might want to fuck us, too good to be true.  Where's the catch?  And usually there is one.  Here there's not because they guarantee it.  If you don't find some sex-deprived wife whose husband probably has an erection, I hate  when they write E.D. with a dash.  Just put rod problems.  We all know what you mean.  We're men.  They guarantee you're going to find some broad whose hubby has rod trouble.  Ashley Madison will give you money back. 
[02:29:00]  What's better?  Popping a blue pill.  Viagra gives you a stuffy nose and a headache.  And then you still have to look at her dumb face again.  Again.  You're fucking away.  You're thinking.  And then you have that vacant stare because you're thinking of anybody but her.  What are you thinking of?  Anything but you.  And your same wife breath that you've been breathing.  You're breathing your wife breath in my face.  I hate your wife breath. 
[02:29:30]  Been smelling it since the fucking reception.  Your dry champagne breath.  Aren't you tired of taking pills just to fuck this monster over and over again?  Listen to your dick.  It's yelling at you.  That little hole is opening up.  Help me.  Your dick is talking to you like Linda Blair spoke to the priest and the exorcist.  That's the little help me across your stomach, you idiots.  Find some new hot pussy.  Fuck Viagra.  Go to AshleyMadison.com.  It's 100% secure.  It's anonymous.  And Viagra free. 
[02:30:00]  Try it today, you zilch.  This is the Opie and Anthony channel on Sirius XM.  New from Grody Publishing comes the audio book.  So erotic, it will make you question everything.  Damn, that's a good book on tape.  The best-selling cultural phenomenon evolves just for men.  It's Fifty Shades of Gay.  The muscles inside the deepest, darkest part of me clench in the most delicious fashion. 
[02:30:30]  Club Soda Kenny takes you on a journey you've only been to in your deepest fantasies.  Suck me, baby.  Millions of red-blooded men have gotten rigid over the excitement of Fifty Shades of Gay.  Bro, I've tasted my cum?  After hearing Fifty Shades of Gay, I would totally be down for tasting someone else's.  Or whatever.  I'm a quivering, moist mess, and he hasn't even touched me. 
[02:31:00]  I've always been a guy that's, like, totally into chicks with tits and stuff like that.  But you know what?  This book is frickin' hot as shit.  Holy fuck.  This is wrong.  But holy hell, is it erotic.  For the first time, I'm sexually attracted to something that isn't available at the deli counter.  My insides practically contort with potent, needy, liquid desire.  Ooh, I don't fuck guys, man.  But I'll jack off to this, man.  Damn! 
[02:31:30]  The experts agree.  Fifty Shades of Gay is a must-listen.  Hello, I'm Dr. Gay.  This audiobook is a must-listen for any man looking to further a healthy sex life.  I'm erect.  Fifty Shades of Gay.  If you're not turned on now, you will be.  Yum.  Sirius X.  It's the OP&A 3 Show. 
[02:32:00]  Another thing.  No, just kidding.  And another thing.  He lied and I'm having a ball in the pool.  God damn it.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  So what did you do when I was blown off about the party?  Yeah.  This all started with the fact that you were kind of blown off because you were trying to 
[02:32:30]  figure out if the party was going on.  Sitting around, waiting for the dummy.  So you needed to make plans.  No.  Well, I did have a guest with me.  So we decided it would probably be better anyway, fuck that guy, to go to my house.  I got a pool.  I got barbecue.  Yes, you do.  I got the beer.  Yes, you do.  And I don't have a bunch of things I got to lie about.  You definitely do not.  Exactly.  So went there. 
[02:33:00]  And then, get this shit.  Two more people come over, right?  So now that's three lovely young ladies at the house.  And so we decided, I've never done this before, playing a wacky game.  We go into the movie theater, right?  Rape the guests.  It's called Rape the Guests.  Yay.  It's a fun game where a handgun and tape are used, and Anthony will rape the guests. 
[02:33:30]  But it was legitimate rape, so they're not going to get pregnant.  Right.  But Anthony has.  We will get to that clip.  Something the women have secreted or something.  I have no idea.  Somebody, a woman sap.  We went into the theater.  Shut all the lights off, right?  You just shut every fucking light off.  It's pitch black in the theater.  And now, you play tag.  You got to try to, like, one person is it.  What is wrong with you?  And then you walk around, because it's fucked up.  Let me tell you something. 
[02:34:00]  It's fucked up because you can't run, right?  You can't run.  So you got to kind of hide.  But then when you're reaching around, you feel like a tit.  Yes, of course.  So you're looking around, you're trying to, like...  How did you pull this off?  How do you say everybody get naked?  I didn't say naked.  Did your cop come out?  No, no.  I would have just dangled my prick out.  That would have been hilarious, though, to just have you take it out and just stand  in one spot waiting.  To me and you just tag each other in the corner for an hour.  All the girls are like, where are they? 
[02:34:30]  They're tagging each other's penises.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  We're playing tag.  How old are you?  Old enough to know how to play tag.  You were playing tag in the dark.  But it's because it's in the theater, so it's pitch black.  But there's steps.  There's all these things you can trip over and paralyze.  Yes, very dangerous.  Someone broke their neck.  Because you can't run.  And then you've got to kind of be very quiet when you walk.  And you're feeling on the seat.  What happens if you tag somebody?  Then they're it.  What would be fun?  Then you've got to...  There's no tag backs.  So then I run away and I hide somewhere. 
[02:35:00]  What was the purpose of this game?  Be honest.  Just to...  Field tits.  See how long you can kind of hang out without getting caught.  Whose suggestion was it?  That was the actual...  My guest.  Oh, really?  Yes, I didn't suggest...  That would have really made it creepy.  Hey, girls.  You want to play tag?  I know a good game we can play in the theater.  What would be fun is if you played...  Not a runaround tag.  But if you played a game like that in your entire basement. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  And the second floor of your house with all the lights out.  That would be fun with a bunch of chicks.  Yes.  But you'd have to put things so no one killed themselves.  We were thinking of that, actually.  But then there's too much stuff laying around, you know, to walk into and tip over and break  and shit.  So the theater was kind of cool because it was small, but it was pitch black.  You couldn't see anything.  So you're groping around and all of a sudden you just feel a tit.  I'm not saying it's a bad game.  It's just...  You feel a fucking ass on the seat.  I'm not saying it's a bad game. 
[02:36:00]  Well, logically it makes sense.  Sure.  This is so strange that you get to the point where...  Did you tag anyone a little slower than you should have tagged?  I did.  I laid my hand right on a tit at one point.  It was like direct hit.  Some of the other ones were side tit.  And then there was an ass just like...  Just grab ass.  All right.  Was there like a naive woman in the theater that thought you were still playing tag?  No.  You were actually in the back of the theater hiding, so to speak, with somebody else?  No, I actually did feel very proud at one point because I was the last one caught and they couldn't find me. 
[02:36:30]  One of the girls actually said, I heard them talking, because they were all at that point trying to find where I was.  And they go, did he leave?  And then one goes, no, you dummy.  The door would open.  You'd see it.  And then one of them actually said, is he on the ceiling?  Like I'm Spider-Man.  All right.  Now, why is this so odd?  I don't know.  Is anyone singing karaoke?  Oh, yeah.  Later on.  What time is this at? 
[02:37:00]  This is probably 8.30 at night.  Yeah.  8.30.  Then there's pool, a little karaoke, you know.  But there's so much to do at your place.  Yeah.  So why wouldn't you do that for a little while?  How long did you play tag for?  About an hour.  An hour.  An hour.  That sounds like fun for 10 minutes.  No.  It's an hour's worth of fun.  I just don't know how to have fun.  Why do people say, look, I just need to know how to play tag.  A little creepy, and it's that.  How is that creepy?  I wouldn't say that's creepy. 
[02:37:30]  I absolutely would have done that if I was there.  Fuck yeah.  Just to grab some fucking tits and shitters.  You know, you just kind of.  It's a game.  I mean, why?  See, you know, you people don't.  You don't know how to play kick the can.  See?  It's like the Twilight Zone.  How old are the girls?  Um, they were all of legal age.  Yeah.  What country?  What country are those legal age?  Yeah.  Thailand. 
[02:38:00]  You know, I know the girls are all legal.  Some fucking horrid African nation.  Yes.  All right.  That sounds like fun.  It was a lot of fun.  Then everyone jumps in the pool.  And then, yeah, there was some swimming festivities.  Right?  Yeah.  That's fine.  I like that.  And then, um, and then, uh, what the hell else did I?  Oh, then I put a big flashlight on one of my helicopters and shine the light in my neighbor's  window.  Ha ha! 
[02:38:30]  It was hilarious!  It looked like a fucking, like a UFO.  Did they do anything?  Nah, they were probably asleep.  Yeah.  And you wonder why the old bag calls the cops whenever she can.  All the time.  You know, I was responsible at one point in the jacuzzi.  I turned the music down.  Yeah.  And I was like, you know, the neighbor's probably going to call the cops or something.  I'm going to be responsible.  Did that.  It was like fucking fun-filled.  Fun-filled.  You want a very brief overview of my day yesterday?  Oh, Jimmy. 
[02:39:00]  Sure.  I went for a very nice walk from our place all the way down the west side.  Nice.  All the way over 42nd Street.  All the way up to 10th Avenue.  And I went and got a nice vegetable juice.  Nice.  So far so good.  A greenish vegetable juice.  Kale.  Whatever it is.  And then I took a shower and farted.  Yeah.  And I shit in the shower.  Did you really?  Yeah.  From the juice?  Yeah.  It goes through you that fast.  A lot of shit.  Fuck. 
[02:39:30]  Shot out of me.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  I have not sharted in a long time.  And I fucking shit in my shower.  You didn't realize it was good?  You weren't going to shit in the purpose?  No.  No, no, no.  I had shat already in the toilet.  And I took a...  I literally thought nothing of it.  You felt your stomach gurgling that quickly?  Not even gurgling.  I just had a gas and...  Were you surprised?  Shocked.  You were shocked?  If that was in my pants, I would have just shit my pants.  I had no qualms about just firing it out like a regular gaster.  Was it Lucy?  Oh, it was like...  Lucy Goosey.  Lucy Goosey. 
[02:40:00]  It was like somebody took pudding stew and jumped out of a glass.  A glass of pudding stew.  What is pudding stew?  It's a terrible treat, either way, when you look at it.  And I just wound up kicking it down the drain.  Please tell me you left it for a...  Morella?  No.  No, I kicked it down the drain.  It was...  I was in the shower.  Did you have to squish it down the drain at any point?  No.  It was just flecked up, and I just was kicking it.  And then I went and sat on the toilet.  And when I stood up, it was all over the seat, because I realized I had shit down the back 
[02:40:30]  of my legs.  And I didn't...  It was a fucking...  Thank God I was in the shower.  Holy fuck.  I had...  That was a bad one.  Now we understand why these bathrooms look like they do.  Yeah.  Damn.  It just happens to people, I guess.  Oh, God.  So that's my entire weekend story.  That was good.  I had a rot-gut practice, too, on Sunday.  You're rot-gutting.  That was good.  Rot-gutting.  We're rot-gutting on Friday...  What is that?  August 29th?  Week from Friday.  I think that's...  Yeah, a week from this Friday in Belmore.  I'll get the... 
[02:41:00]  I don't think it's the 29th there, Pally.  No?  It's the...  No, it is.  No.  No, wait.  I'm sorry.  It's Friday.  Friday would be the 29th.  Friday the 31st.  Then it's the 31st.  Fuck, I don't know.  I just want to make sure...  I don't know how to plug things for myself.  So it's...  Yeah, August 31st.  A week from Friday.  It's going to be on Long Island.  I'll give you the name of the place and everything like that at some juncture.  But it was fun as fuck.  We all just went to a studio that we used to go to years ago.  And it got everything going and started doing some of these old songs that we used to do. 
[02:41:30]  Fucking hilarious.  Can you keep up?  We were laughing our heads up.  Oh, yeah.  No, I mean you vocally.  Yeah.  Because there's a lot going on in some of those songs.  To be honest with you, it's easier now than it ever was.  And I don't know why.  I think because I talk every day on the radio and it kind of strengthens your voice.  Mm-hmm.  And, yeah, it's a lot easier to sing songs in a higher key these days.  Nice.  Yeah.  And we don't have to deal with the guitar play.  We go to put this together like a couple of months ago. 
[02:42:00]  My brother's like, yeah, let's do this.  I'm like, yeah, okay, I'm in.  So he gets in touch with everybody.  And then our guitarist, one of our guitarists over the years, immediately starts drama.  And the drama being that, like, he still resents me for doing radio, thinking that, you know, he'd have been set in a band and stuff.  And just hates that, feels like he said something like, oh, well, if we play together, is Anthony going to pay for my kid's college? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  That dick bag.  Ew.  How embarrassing for a fucking grown-up to resent another guy for going into radio.  Joe.  Fucking asshole.  That was Joe's baby and he didn't resent you.  I know.  He just, he had.  I'll shut my mouth.  It was ridiculous.  But, I mean, you know, Joe was just very happy for you and knew that he would do something else.  And he has.  Just as good, if not better.  And he has, yeah. 
[02:43:00]  It's great.  And so, wait a minute.  So this guy.  So what?  He said that?  He thinks.  So he's struggling as an adult and he blames you because you left the band.  He blames me for leaving the band.  But if he's that talented, go jump on another band.  Exactly.  And you would have been successful.  Exactly.  And I don't even know if he's talented.  I'm just saying.  He leaves.  I leave the band.  And he is under the assumption that, like, we would have gone on to great, huge things.  Guaranteed.  We take the tapes down to the record company.  They give us a contract. 
[02:43:30]  We come back and pay you the money.  But what if...  That was a possibility.  Oh, exactly.  That was definitely a possibility.  Could have been.  It's a possibility, but it's...  It was so fucking long shot.  Most bands don't make it, dude.  And they don't.  Exactly.  It's like, fuck that.  So what happened?  So he started giving his bullshit and my brother just said, you know what?  Fuck off.  So we got the drummer's...  Is it nephew?  Or cousin?  Oh, he's out of the band?  But you got his cousin? 
[02:44:00]  Well, the drummer...  No, no.  The drummer is...  I know the drummer.  Yeah, yeah.  The drummer.  He was always cool, right?  It's not that guy.  Wait, the drummer's not...  No, no, no.  The drummer's Fred.  Yeah, I like Fred.  Fred's fucking great.  Fred's always been cool.  Yeah, yeah.  So Fred's...  It's either cousin or nephew.  He's playing guitar now.  Oh, I gotcha.  He's playing guitar.  And he's learning the shit fast?  Fucking real fast.  It sounds amazing.  It sounds tight as fuck.  That's got to be pissing off a little bit more.  Oh, probably.  Probably.  How long was he in the band for before he got booted? 
[02:44:30]  Like, how long did...  When you guys said we were going to do this, what was the first indication that he resented  you?  Immediately.  He called my brother up and just started his drama shit.  And my brother was just like, fuck you.  But what has he done since the band broke up?  Nothing.  What has Fred done?  Fred's married, has kids, works, coaches his kids' hockey team and shit.  Just happy.  He's having a great life.  Your brother moved on to all sorts of shit.  Yeah, my brother's doing great.  Joe Curry, you know, Joe Curry's doing...  Joe Curry doesn't resent you.  He's doing his comedy and he still performs with other things. 
[02:45:00]  Is he in the band?  Yeah.  Joe Curry's a keyboard player.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Okay.  Yep.  Oh, everyone should go check this.  That was a really nice thing.  It sounded...  Yesterday was the first time I rehearsed with them.  They had gotten together to get the instrumental shit together.  And it just came right together.  It sounded...  It's so, like, tight.  The music is very, like, funk-oriented as far as, like, chili pepper-ish.  So it's very tight and everything.  It's a cool band, to be honest with you.  You should check it out. 
[02:45:30]  Friday the 31st, right?  Yeah.  Wow.  In the early days, he used to give me, like, a...  Oh, because he...  A face full of shit.  You ruined the band.  Yeah.  He's calling me Yoko and shit because I grabbed Anthony.  You ruined the band.  Ew.  He's up to Anthony.  He would...  How embarrassing for a grown man to act like that.  Right.  Jealous of his friend's success.  He threw a lot of shit in my face.  I'm like, look, here's an opportunity for the guy.  It's up to him.  Yeah.  I'm not forcing him to do anything.  Of course not.  At that point, I was already doing radio.  You know?  I would have been all right. 
[02:46:00]  Who knows?  I would have been...  He fuckers.  I would have at least had a living.  Have you seen him since, like, over the years?  I saw him once.  And this was something we were doing.  You guys got back together.  We did.  Because he gave me shit that day, too.  We got together to do something.  That was when we were off the air.  He was ripping into me at one of the studios that we were at.  And just, like, fucking...  He's all drunk and fucking yelling at me.  Like, I don't fuck...  Yelling about what?  I don't fucking need...  His life and how fucking, you know...  You just fucking left and fuck you. 
[02:46:30]  And I was like, I don't need this fucking shit.  And I just walked away, got into my car and left.  Good.  Can I tell you something?  Yeah, I'm going to say it.  The band was Ant and his brother.  He was...  The other guys were very good.  Don't get me wrong.  They're very good musicians.  But the band, when you think about it, was Ant and his brother.  He, um...  The other people, you know, could be replaced very easily.  And I'm not trying to trash anyone because they're very good musicians.  Yeah.  But when you feel the heart of the band, I guess is what I'm saying. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  It was you and your brother.  What is this guy living in the summer of 69?  Ant quit.  Jimmy got married.  I mean, too bad.  I used to have to deal with a lot of that shit when I came around.  I'm like, look, man.  We did some radio together.  We had some chemistry.  And I got us an offer.  It's up to him.  Yeah.  He could have...  Technically, you could have kept the band together through the radio gig.  Oh, yeah, that's what I wanted to do.  But you could have.  Would have been impossible.  But you didn't really want to at that point. 
[02:47:30]  I didn't want to.  At that point, I was just like, this is fucking great.  You're doing radio.  It was fun.  I'm doing radio.  It's fucking great.  Plus, we were off the air for two years.  You could have went back then.  You didn't want to.  No.  Nope.  26 months.  Yeah, over two years.  Well, they did a gig.  Yeah, yeah.  We've, over the years, occasionally gotten back together and stuff.  But never had, like, good rehearsals and really gotten everybody back on board.  Because the band breaks up, he never did anything again?  I guess.  He thought that was the big shot.  And resents me for ruining his fucking life and opportunity to be a big rock star. 
[02:48:00]  So that went, like, right away.  My brother was just like, okay, I see what's happening.  Later.  And had the guy take it.  Not well, I guess.  I don't know.  I wasn't in on that conversation.  But why not instead just realizing, hey, wow, I'm a bitter asshole and it's my fault.  It's your fault.  Uh-huh.  Be fucking, it's your fault if someone, it's not like you guys had a contract or a big deal. 
[02:48:30]  You just.  Exactly.  You weren't fucking, he would have had you remain in air conditioning.  Yeah.  Like the scumbag, no disrespect, but like the garbage that you were, like he would have  had you.  The Long Island garbage that you were.  The lump of shit.  That piece of shit.  With no car.  But he would have had you continue to do that.  And hope a band worked.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's kind of selfish.  Very selfish.  That's exactly what you want.  I remember back then who I was worried about, because yeah, obviously, you know, we were  going to try to make this thing happen.  Yeah.  I was worried about your brother the most. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, exactly.  It was even more his baby in a way.  Like he, you know.  Yes.  And your brother, I'll never forget it.  He was beyond cool.  He was excited and he was thinking to himself, oh my God, this might even be more opportunities  for me, you know?  Yeah.  But I mean, but he made it on his own.  We didn't need to help him.  He fucking just knows what he's doing.  Right.  And Fred was always cool.  And Fred's great.  And Joe Curry was always cool.  We were fucking, obviously, the story wouldn't even translate to that, but we were laughing 
[02:49:30]  so fucking hard last night, running through some of this shit and just like remembering  some of the fucking crap that went on.  And if other guitarist guy was there, it just would have been a chore.  Right.  It would have been a fucking, just a dead weight.  Yeah.  It's a Paul.  Boo.  Yeah.  Why you fucking left?  Yeah.  I didn't know this guy.  You're a fucking guy.  You fucking, you just left the band, fucking left. 
[02:50:00]  It's just sitting here.  How many times do you think he's complained about that over the years to whoever would listen?  Oh my God.  I'm sure plenty of times.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, a week from Friday.  That's going to be cool.  Yeah.  A week from Friday.  Good for you.  I'm going to go to that.  I'm back.  A big shindig.  I'm doing something in LA that week.  And I'm going to come back to Friday morning.  And I'm going to go to that gig.  What are you doing in LA?  I have Leno and I have a Jeff Ross show taping. 
[02:50:30]  He's doing the burn.  So I'm doing a couple things.  Nice.  And I'm coming home Friday morning and I will absolutely go to that.  I'm going to check my brother's fucking text here.  Oh, maybe I deleted them because I do that with all my tweets.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  What were you having a party or something?  Maybe I delete all of them.  Hey, we should bring the internet and fucking call him out on this shit.  If anyone throughout today has another angle on this fucking pool party, please get a hold  of me.  Because I need to know what the fuck.  Oh, here it is. 
[02:51:00]  Go ahead.  All right.  It's at KJ Farrell's in Belmore, New York.  How fun in the city is that?  What was it called?  Before.  I know.  Every Long Island place, you're just like, what is that place in Belmore?  It would take you about a half hour from the city.  Not on that Friday.  Not at Belmore.  Oh, boy.  That's the Friday before Labor Day.  Well, come out early.  We'll hang out at my house.  We'll touch each other's pricks.  What time is the gig?  Like eight?  God damn it.  What do you guys play for? 
[02:51:30]  Like four hours?  It shouldn't be that.  A couple hours, right?  Yeah, a couple hours.  Good, solid couple hours.  I'd like to bring something.  I mean, bring a young lady.  Bring a young lady.  Come by the house.  And then that whole weekend is just going to be a debaucherous party weekend at my house.  It's 9.30 p.m.  Start.  But I think Art of the Topless is going on for us.  Do you remember that?  Oh, nice.  They sing all the songs from our show and Ron and Fez's show and stuff like that.  Very nice.  So they're opening and then it's a Rotgut at K.J. Farrell's. 
[02:52:00]  I know, right?  She's just going to sit there and drink.  No, that's not fair for her.  She's a musician, too.  Yeah, I know.  You've got to get her involved.  She can harmonize something.  Not with the Rotgut stuff.  That's for sure.  I want to hear a Rotgut song.  Do you have any Rotgut in there?  Like, I know we do.  Oh, man.  Danny would have looked it up.  But fucking Sam's apparently just relaxing.  I have your album in here.  Oh, boy.  What's a good song?  What's one of your better songs?  I don't even know what's on there.  How many original songs do you guys have? 
[02:52:30]  We realized last night there had to be 50 or fucking 60 of them.  I Want to Be Your Man is a really cool cover.  That's like a...  That's a...  Yeah, kind of a...  How about what's the one about the girl that I love so much?  That's...  Hold on.  I want to be your man.  The cowboy one.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that was before Naked Cowboy.  Put that on.  I was a Naked Cowboy first.  Hey, Mar.  What you gonna be when you're dead?  Oh, I don't know. 
[02:53:00]  I'm a little embarrassed to say.  No, not Dara.  You're all out of your shell.  Oh, well, ever since I was a young man, there's the one thing I've always wanted to be.  Why don't you tell us about it?  Well, I want to be an Naked Cowboy!  Well, I'd rather be in the nude.  I can wear my boots, my camera, what the suit, and rock to my fucking black and blue.  Oh, well, I want to be your Naked Outlaw! 
[02:53:30]  I'm a robber bank in the law.  I can wear my hat, give you a match-in-back.  It's first to make it think it's dangerous.  We're not doing this, though.  Why?  I don't know.  The drums are good.  Oh, yeah.  So why don't we play what you're doing?  I like this.  Why don't you do this?  That's the one we're doing.  All right.  I'm going to get a Naked Cowboy chant going.  We want Naked Cowboy!  I like this.  It's very, uh, yeah.  Which one are... 
[02:54:00]  You've got to know what you're doing.  Yeah.  Well, I just thought...  These drums are great.  Joe will write you.  Is he still texting?  I think so.  Very fast.  I'll figure something out and then play it, like...  I might go up and jam with you guys.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That'd be good.  It's not country music.  Yeah, you can bring it down.  It's good.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Play something else, dude.  Thank you, E-Rock.  E-Rock. 
[02:54:30]  What's another one?  Oh, no.  Come on, and don't be shy.  What do you even know you're doing?  Stop being Samuel the Shy Sea Lion.  No, I'm not because...  Do you even have a band?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Yeah, I had texts, but I deleted them.  Are you really playing a week from Friday?  I swear.  You sure?  I'm opening up with the sick fucking puppies.  That's my fucking song, Cuck Sucka.  Cuck Sucka.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'll figure it out.  We've got another couple of weeks.  We'll play one tomorrow.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me get...  Because Joe will know the perfect one.  He'll get something from Joe.  He'll know the good one. 
[02:55:00]  He's the hit maker.  All right, listen.  Yeah, Dr. Drew lost another one, huh, Sam?  What a guy.  We're keeping track of all the celebrity rehab deaths.  Dr. Drew...  Joey Kovar?  Yeah, he was on The Real World.  Real World Hollywood?  Hollywood.  Was anyone watching at that point?  Celebrity rehab.  Yeah, he died of suspected drug overdose and alcohol.  I suppose he was bleeding from his ears and his nose.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, the last thing I read said... 
[02:55:30]  How do you bleed from your ears?  The nose I get from cocaine and shit, but how does it...  I feel like the ears bleeding.  How do you bleed from your ears?  Maybe he had a fight or an injury.  Listen to this show.  Yeah.  Listen for the first two and a half hours.  Because when I was taking karate, I would always box the ears.  Oh, it's karate, Joe.  The last thing I read said that he had in his system something like cocaine, alcohol, and  Viagra.  Is he all right?  And that he had gone to sleep.  Well, the Viagra would make sense because that thins the blood, right? 
[02:56:00]  They think he had an aneurysm.  Oh, man.  Yeah, it probably did.  If he's got blood coming out of his ears, he probably busted a fucking gasket.  Can Viagra cause an aneurysm?  I've wondered that when I've taken it.  I think it can.  It does something to your blood pressure.  I know.  It makes my nose stuffy.  I mean, a whole bunch of cocaine and alcohol probably don't help either.  Oh, yeah.  I'm forgetting that.  Cocaine.  But, yeah, he was at some chick's house.  So, how many...  Some chick.  I remember seeing him on Celebrity Rehab or Sober House.  I forget.  Celebrity Rehab.  He came in halfway through with a major drinking problem, I remember. 
[02:56:30]  And his parents were very concerned.  Died zooded.  So, how many people have died from the Dr. Drew shows?  Well, he was in the same season as Mike Starr.  Yeah, who's now dead.  He's dead.  So, it's him, Mike Starr.  And everyone basically said, Mike, you're going to die like Lane Staley.  It's going to happen.  And he did.  And Dr. Drew is so proud of Mike Starr.  He brought him back.  Yeah, yeah.  Here's one of my success stories. 
[02:57:00]  As a success story, to talk to the other people.  Look, Mama, your son's a big success.  But, like Jimmy says, this is very normal.  This is not...  Not a reflection on Drew.  It really is the...  This is the ratio, man.  Most people die.  Wow.  What is it?  5% to 4% they said?  I've heard 8% or 10%.  Yeah?  Not much?  Yeah.  I mean, that's not a lot, though.  No, it's not.  That's 9 out of 10 are dead.  Yes.  I mean, most people die active.  So...  Wow.  How many deaths does he have to...  I believe 4.  4. 
[02:57:30]  Holy shit.  4 deaths.  He's like Vince McMahon at this point.  Jeff Conway.  Right.  This guy, John Kovar, and Mike Starr.  But he's had a bunch of close calls, too.  Sure.  Man.  China and Shifty and...  Right.  ...how much other people are...  Is he still making that show?  No.  They finally said luck.  Did they stop it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They said luck.  Enough.  Yeah.  Enough of your bullshitting, trying to take care of people.  Well, I believe he is, but he's also exploiting them. 
[02:58:00]  Now he does his daytime show and his HLN show.  Yeah.  He's a good guy.  Hmm.  And then we lose Top Gun guy.  Commit suicide.  And that's Ridley Scott's brother, Tony Scott.  That's a crazy way to commit suicide.  Jumped off a fucking bridge.  He just pulled his car over, his little black Prius, and just got out and jumped over the  railing of a fucking bridge.  There was a note, too.  A bridge in L.A.  Yeah, there was a note in the car, yeah.  Here's the news story. 
[02:58:30]  It's quick.  Tony Scott, director of such Hollywood hits as Top Gun, Days of Thunder, and Beverly Hills  Cop 2, died Sunday after jumping from a Los Angeles County bridge.  He was 68.  Officials say Scott's death is being investigated as a suicide.  The British-born Scott who lived in Beverly Hills was producer and director Ridley Scott's  younger brother.  While Ridley Scott mastered the creation of entire worlds with such films as Gladiator, Blade  Runner, and Alien, and this year's Prometheus, Tony Scott was known for hyperkinetic action 
[02:59:00]  and editing in such films as his most recent success, the runaway train thriller Unstoppable.  Scott was married to actress Donna Scott, who appeared in several of her husband's films.  Great Scott!  They have twin sons.  How selfish.  You're married with kids.  I guess they're older, but...  He did Pelham 1, 2, 3.  Yeah, that new one.  That might have been it.  Zoix.  That might have been a problem.  He did Top Gun.  What else did he do?  Days of Thunder, I think.  He did True Romance.  He did True Romance.  Yeah, he was good, man.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  By the way, I watched some of the Jaws on fucking Blu-ray. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  Just for Robert Shaw.  Oh, yeah.  He was amazing.  Robert Shaw was fucking amazing.  He was great.  Amazing.  Yeah.  He is so goddamn good in that movie.  I love the fucking Lady of Spain when he's saying Lady of Spain.  Oh, yeah.  Farewell, Linda Du.  Yeah.  That's great.  He wasn't nominated for an Oscar, right?  I don't believe so.  In that?  75?  Yeah, but nowadays, if Jaws came out with a performance like that, they would absolutely consider  him, but back then, it had to be more of a class.  That's so fucked up.  Why?  I would assume like he would have been nominated. 
[03:00:00]  At least I really thought he was.  Oh, you said for that.  What did you say?  I thought it would be amazing.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you meant for him and Jaws.  I thought it was like, you know, someone from Jaws being nominated.  Oh, no.  He should have been.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Fucking great.  Was that 75?  Because if that was 75, Cuckoo's Nest won.  But we're going to know all the more.  Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon was nominated, I believe.  He would be Best Supporting Actor, right?  Officially?  Yeah.  Yes.  Okay.  So who was nominated that year? 
[03:00:30]  Was that 75?  Best Supporting.  I believe it was 75.  Yes, I do believe.  Hmm.  This is 75.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Go with Best Supporting Actor.  Best Actor in Supporting World.  There you go.  So who was?  De Niro, Godfather 2.  Oh, a lot of Godfather 2s.  I was 75?  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Pacino got nominated and didn't win.  Art Carney won Best Actor that year.  Wait, wait.  Who else?  Jeff Bridges.  I can't read that far.  Yeah.  Best Actor in a Supporting World.  Yeah.  It was Fred Astaire for The Towering Inferno. 
[03:01:00]  Jeff Bridges for Thunderbolt and Lightfoot.  Oh, man.  And then Michael Vigazo and Lee Strasburg.  Both for The Godfather 2.  You could have got rid of Fred Astaire.  Well, Lee Strasburg, and I understand everybody loved Lee Strasburg, but he didn't give an  Oscar-worthy performance, did he?  He clicked his way through that fucking movie.  Unless Jaws was technically in the 76th, Oscar.  76, Rocky won.  I could just be off by a year.  Check 76, then, my sweet.  Yeah, there was a spot for him to at least be nominated.  I hate that you can never tell which fucking Academy Awards goes with what year moving. 
[03:01:30]  I know.  I know.  Pain in the ass.  Well, let's just do it to be on the safe side.  Best Supporting Act.  Well, no.  If that's...  Godfather 2 came out in 74.  If it's the 75 Oscars and the 76 technically is the 75 year, that's what I believe in Cuckoo's  Nest.  Oh, my God.  Cuckoo's Nest War.  I think this would be the year officially, you think?  Yeah.  For Jaws?  All right.  Was it nominated?  Yes.  You got George Burns and the Sunshine Boys.  George Burns was great, but he played the exact same fucking guy.  You don't like what you see here.  Get the funk out. 
[03:02:00]  There was no...  There was no...  There was never a stretch with his performances.  No, never.  Who else there, Sam?  Brad DeReef from One Flew Over the Cook.  Brad Dourif, you zilch.  Oh, boy.  And which one was he in...  It was Billy Bivitt.  Oh, right on, yeah.  Billy Bivitt.  Brad DeReef.  How did he not fucking win?  How did Brad Dourif not win?  They gave it to George Burns, huh?  Ah, those melancholy assholes.  George Burns.  George Burns played himself.  Who else?  Burgess Meredith for Rocky.  No, Day of Locust.  Oh, Day of Locust. 
[03:02:30]  Chris Sarandon for Dog Day Afternoon.  Oh, was he good?  He was good.  And Jack Warden for Shampoo.  Ah, you could put Robert Shaw in there somewhere.  How did they not at least nominate him?  That's craziness.  He had so much Shakespearean work that was respected, though.  Man.  He was so good, man.  Yeah, he really is.  And nobody was...  I was watching that scene where they're in the fucking...  They're in the town hall and the mayor's talking,  and Shaw just, like, eeeeee, scratches the board.  There's not one fuckable person in that room. 
[03:03:00]  Did we talk about this on Friday?  Oh, yeah.  We did, right?  They were all ugly.  And that's...  And it's like, now there's the obsession where, like, you know,  Ethan Hawke would have to be in...  But they were all older and fucking 40 and average schlumps.  And safe to say, they probably were a lot of locals.  They just said, look, you want to be in this scene?  Right.  That's not funny.  I don't think that's funny at all.  That woman...  Oh, yeah.  This is payable by check?  By check?  Or cash? 
[03:03:30]  Oh, my gosh.  But now they're, you know, they're scared to use real people.  Yeah.  They're like, no, you'll look like the homeless guy instead of getting the homeless guy.  Right?  Yeah, or they'll use just a good-looking actor instead of an ugly actor, which isn't arranging.  But I bet you a lot of those were town people.  They said, look, you want to be in this scene?  That great fucking mayor suit.  Oh, it's the great...  Mayor Vaughn's suit with the anchors.  Oh, I'm on an island.  I need a suit.  It's got that dumb suit.  Fucking great movie.  Jesus.  I wish I could hear Robert Shaw sing the whole fucking song. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  And that speech, the Indianapolis scene?  Yeah, yeah.  That's fucking classic.  You felt like you were on the fucking boat, didn't you?  It's so good.  You're like, wait, I'm on my couch, right?  You really felt like, holy...  And he's smiling at one point, talking about something, and then he just gets all, like, fuck,  that sucked.  You know what my favorite line in that was?  Because it was such a weird way to do it.  It's like, I just watched, like, what a brilliant actor choice he made.  He just goes, uh, we realize no distress signal had been sent. 
[03:04:30]  Had been sent.  Had been sent.  It was such a weird fucking way to go off.  How do you deliver that line like that?  How long has it seen?  Watch the way he delivers that line.  I say we play it.  Watch part of it.  Play part of it.  Let's play it.  It's a great performance.  Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into our side, Chief.  Chief.  He was coming back from the island of Tinian to Lady and just delivered the bomb, the Hiroshima  bomb. 
[03:05:00]  It's a bomb.  A hundred men went into the water.  Vessel went down in 12 minutes.  Didn't see the first shark for about half an hour.  Tiger, 13-footer, you know, you know that when you're in the water, Chief, you tell by  looking from the dorsal to the tail.  What we didn't know was our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signal had been 
[03:05:30]  sent.  What's that?  It's such an odd...  Had been sent.  Had been sent.  How did you pick up on that?  Because it amazed me.  I've noticed that through the years.  Because as an actor, like, an actor to do this monologue, like, every actor looks for  monologues.  That's what you do.  Like, this is a good one.  My favorite part so far is how he just flipped the hat off with his two fingers.  Yeah, yeah.  Unfortunately, they went with a cutaway shot.  I always thought this was a one-take job. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  No, no.  He was such a drunk.  They probably couldn't get anything on one-take out of him.  Oh, my God, right?  Yeah, because the reaction shot and then there's a reset because now he's drinking a little  coffee, but it's still...  Go back slightly.  But there was a fucking, no, the stress signal had been sent and his mouth is open.  And I'm just like, what an odd way to fucking take that line.  Like, that's such a natural speech way to do it.  I just watched it.  I was like, oh, God, is he great.  You're watching brilliance.  He was great.  Yeah. 
[03:06:30]  No, the stress signal had been sent.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  They didn't even list as overdue for a wee.  Very first light, chief, sharks come cruising.  So we formed ourselves into tight groups.  And then a little music.  No, it was kind of like old squares in a battle, like you see in a calendar, like the Battle  of Waterloo.  And the idea was, shark comes to the nearest man, that man, he starts pounding and hollering 
[03:07:00]  and screaming.  And then sometimes the shark go away.  Sometimes he wouldn't go away.  Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you.  Right into your eyes.  You know the thing about a shark, he's got lifeless eyes.  Black eyes, like a doll's eyes.  Like Steve Platter.  He comes at you.  What's that?  He shakes his head, disapproving.  And while you're doing a bitty stanza and he's giving you a jughead look. 
[03:07:30]  Ah, and then you get your paycheck and you hear that awful high-pitched screaming and hollering.  Yeah, and they say, well, you're going to be there anyway, so we're only going to reimburse  you a quarter of the expense.  Sometimes they reimburse you.  Sometimes they don't reimburse you.  And I love how he drags his words.  Yes!  He's just dragging his words.  It's like one long word. 
[03:08:00]  It's so good.  It works with the accent.  His voice itself is just great.  He's got a very good, raspy, low voice to deliver a monologue like this.  It's fucking great.  Everything was great about this.  Is he hiding his accent by talking that way?  No.  I don't think he is.  He sounds very British.  He's got like that.  I think he still sounds very British.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It almost sounds like he's trying to sound a little American.  Sometimes he don't go away.  No, he just sounds like an old C-hand.  Yeah, of course.  I would do this wrong.  Sometimes he doesn't go away.  I would overdo it.  Sometimes.  Sometimes he goes away. 
[03:08:30]  Sometimes he doesn't.  I would hit the table.  We've got to get Rick Voss to do this one.  Oh, God.  Sometimes he doesn't.  I don't know.  You read, Quint?  You bob upside down, Herbie, from Cleveland?  Oh, Cleveland?  Yeah.  And then a big old PPJ came and picked us up.  Oh, wait a minute.  It's peanut butter and jelly.  A PBY. 
[03:09:00]  Why would a peanut butter and jelly sandwich pick us up?  Sometimes they reimburse you.  Sometimes they don't reimburse you.  Do they reimburse you, probably?  No.  What happened with that?  I mean, they won't.  They said it was over.  By the way, I went away.  People thought I got suspended or something.  I took my three-day summer vacation.  Thank you to SiriusXM.  I really appreciate it.  But before I left, they said they were going to call you.  That was a misunderstanding. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, Gary had.  Or somebody called me and said.  They said, that's not right.  That's a misunderstanding.  So it won't happen in the future.  Gary says it won't happen in the future.  The future.  We can straighten this out.  Maybe I misread, too.  I mean, I haven't talked to them.  I've avoided both of them.  How they made it sound was that was not right at all.  Oh, okay.  And they didn't take care of the problem.  Okay.  I've avoided anyone.  I didn't have a skin tag removed.  Please.  What?  It's still there.  How big was this skin tag?  It was a three-inch skin tag that was irritating your thigh because it was dangling from your  scrotum.  Three inches. 
[03:10:00]  And whenever you ran, it would rub.  Ow.  Sometimes a scrotum skin tag go away.  I went down to Diamond Beach.  It was nice.  You know how big it is?  You measure from the taint to the top of your shaft.  You measure from the taint to the knee.  You divide it in half.  That's how big it is.  What we didn't know.  There was another skin tag lurking by our asshole.  I don't think I've ever had a skin tag.  You know how you can tell a skin tag looks like a hemorrhoid, but it's not an asshole. 
[03:10:30]  No doctor had been called.  It wasn't even going to put ointment on it for a week.  A three-inch skin tag would bleed a lot.  It's awful.  A lot of blood.  Yeah.  That would be like cutting a vein, right?  Cut it up like calamari.  Chewing it.  I do feel very relaxed for my three days off. 
[03:11:00]  That was very nice of the company.  That's good.  Really terrific.  Thank you.  Do you like him in this movie, Robert Shaw?  He's great.  He was also in the original Pelham.  Yeah.  He was the fucking bad guy.  He was great in Pelham 1-2-3.  Do you have the death penalty in New York?  And they said, no.  Pity.  And he electrocutes himself on the fucking third rail.  Is that how Travolta did it?  Or did he just do it on a massage table on the fucking, the new taking of Pelham 1-2-3?  Get out.  Put your fingers in my asshole.  He was so over the. 
[03:11:30]  What?  Is there any taking of Pelham 1-2-3?  I know.  Isn't it cool?  Oh.  Oh, when he does that fucking over-the-top guy.  Robert Shaw.  Did you guys watch the making of Jaws?  Someone is saying, and probably Ann would know, this part wasn't in the script.  But Rob in Pennsylvania, he says, he went off on a drunken tangent.  Spielberg made them keep rolling.  That's why Dreyfuss had that shocked look.  Because Dreyfuss was like, what the fuck is this?  Well, Dreyfuss would have a shocked look.  Really?  But I don't know.  But Dreyfuss is smart enough to realize, whoa, I got to react to this. 
[03:12:00]  He might have improvised something, but I have no idea.  Yeah, right?  Imagine being that guy.  Excuse me.  What's he doing?  Yeah, what is he doing?  Can we get the script girl here?  Because this isn't in the script.  Does anyone know the answer to that?  You know what?  It makes...  I don't know.  I read the book by Benchley.  It's been many, many years.  It is interesting to think if he didn't...  There's a weird thing.  There's one moment where it looks like he's about to say black, but he just... 
[03:12:30]  He's about to say black, and he doesn't say...  He doesn't say black.  He says something else, and then he says black.  He goes, lifeless eyes.  He's about to say black, and he changes his mind, and he says lifeless, and then black.  Black eyes like a doll.  That could also be just being a really good actor.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's amazing.  But it was almost like he was just talking and about to say something, and they just  kind of kept it, because it was a slight imperfection.  The whole thing, to be able to just deliver a speech like that... 
[03:13:00]  You're telling me?  ...with like a story.  I could do it.  Telling me?  I've done it.  Here's more background info.  On the first day of shooting, Robert Shaw was so drunk, they couldn't use it.  He was a notorious drunk, huh?  Yeah.  And he was torturing Dreyfuss on the set, because he didn't love Dreyfuss, because he was the  young, fucking, pukey actor with no stage experience.  And Dreyfuss even says, I saw part of the Jaws extras, and he goes, that Shaw had given  one of the great Shakespearean performances of all time.  He was a great Shakespearean actor. 
[03:13:30]  25 greatest unscripted scenes in films.  Wow.  Wow.  It's in there.  Let's see.  Oh, I've watched this before.  You haven't watched this before.  You would have said that, liar.  Come on, Sam.  How long is this?  Six and a half minutes.  Let's do it.  All right, though.  25 unscripted scenes.  How do we know they're unscripted?  Yeah, exactly.  They're a liar.  Because YouTube's not...  Louie beans!  Louie beans.  I hate Louie beans.  That's so funny.  Louie beans. 
[03:14:00]  What is this guy saying, though?  Is he...  Answer to Opie's question.  The shark wasn't working, as we all know.  And that's what makes this film so terrific.  We were supposed to see the shark a hell of a lot more.  A lot more, right.  And Spielberg said, fuck, I've got to shoot around this shitty shark.  Yeah.  And so they added the Robert Shaw part.  Wow.  Was that...  Because it's a great...  And then they start singing, show me the way to go home.  Man, I'm tired, I don't want to go to bed.  You don't need me to sing it.  So what does Robert Shaw just know everything about, like the Indianapolis and shark attacks 
[03:14:30]  and off the top of his head, the guy's name and Bozeman's mate.  Like, that just seems like...  Herbie from Cleveland, baseball player, sounds like a made-up thing.  Does it?  Yeah, and again, I could just be reaching.  He's a British guy searching for like an American thing.  And that Herbie, the baseball player from Cleveland...  That'd be a...  Let me say hi to Scott.  Scott, how do you know this to be true? 
[03:15:00]  Well, I was on the Shark Week, which I watched all week like a loser.  It was glued to my couch.  But yeah, they...  I mean, he didn't make it up off the top of his head.  It was something that they were...  Maybe thinking of doing or something?  Yeah, absolutely.  They needed filler after that dumb shark wouldn't work.  So they added that thing.  Oh, yeah, but he didn't make it up.  Imagine how shitty the movie probably would have been if that shark worked.  Oh, God.  It probably would have been cartoony or something.  The shark worked...  Yeah, they just had a bunch of it. 
[03:15:30]  The shark's like fucking walking on land, sitting with a top hat.  I still get fucking annoyed.  Even in moments in Georgia, they have the shark doing non-shark.  I mean, they had to.  Non-sharky thing?  Yeah, the shark coming up.  Well, the shark just popping up on the boat or ramming.  A shark would never ram a boat.  Oh, you don't like that?  I like it because it made the movie good, but the shark would never do that.  I don't like when they went for the cutaway and had a real shark.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's one of the only...  It's the shark cage footage.  Yeah, that's actually a little midgety guy in a smaller shark cage off Australia, and 
[03:16:00]  they had sharks swimming around, and it looked a lot bigger.  But yeah, the real shark didn't look like the fake shark.  No, no, no.  That was probably the only flaw I see that bothers me a little bit.  Wow, I never noticed that.  Yeah.  Yeah, the cutaway to the sharks underwater.  Let's go back to the speech.  Go back to the speech.  Sam, stop wrecking everything.  I kind of liked it.  Distressed sailor has been sent.  Sure, no distress.  Sangle has been sent.  Sent.  Sent.  Sent. 
[03:16:30]  I was going to do that all day.  Harvey from Cleveland.  Another thing I got to do all day.  Harvey the baseball player.  He had his hot Ted Sheckler from Cleveland.  Sheckler.  And yes, we called Bill Tedley.  We went to the Emporium.  Picked up some sharking gear.  He seemed to be living until he bites you.  And those black eyes roll over white.  And then, oh, then you hear that terrible high-pitched screaming.  The ocean turns red. 
[03:17:00]  In spite of all the pounding and the hollering, they all come in.  Rip you to pieces.  He's describing Iraq at a steak dinner.  You know, by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men.  I don't know how many sharks.  Maybe a thousand.  I don't know how many men.  They average six an hour.  On Thursday morning, Chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, 
[03:17:30]  Herbie Robinson from Cleveland.  Herbie Robinson.  Baseball player.  Boson's mate.  I thought he was asleep.  Reached over to wake him up.  Bobbed up and down in the water.  It was like a kind of top.  Upended.  Well, he'd been bitten in half below the waist. 
[03:18:00]  Noon of the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura.  So he swung in low and he saw us.  The young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper anyway, he saw us.  And he come in low and three hours later, a big fat PB wife.  Can you point that even?  That was probably a shot.  Had nothing to do with the movie.  Oh, man.  Do you know how great that is?  But what a great, like, you know, young Lockheed pilot,  younger than Mr. Hooper.  Like, to deliver that line, like, I could just watch this all fucking day. 
[03:18:30]  And make it look so natural.  Dude, that's literally as naturally as we're speaking now.  Yeah, yeah.  But he didn't take after fucking take.  Just great.  It's hard.  How do you do that?  It's hard.  The hardest thing is to look natural when you're being filmed.  Yeah.  It's just very difficult.  He's just, that's nothing to him.  He's just talking.  And this happens every fucking time.  Guys, found this link.  The monologue was scripted and even has wrong dates.  That's always the case. 
[03:19:00]  Of course.  Of course.  Ruin it, why don't you?  Yeah.  February the 22nd, 1910.  It's during the Titanic.  Anthony?  Yeah.  Anthony from Queens.  The scene was planned out that night.  Out the night before.  It was not in the script.  See?  And Shaw was drunk off his ass for the entire scene.  He was for the whole movie.  He was drunk.  There were days they would not know.  They said you never knew what you were going to get with him until you shot.  Wow.  Some days he was great. 
[03:19:30]  Some days he wasn't great.  Some days his liver would roll over black.  What did he die of?  I don't know, actually.  I think he had a heart attack.  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, how long after this?  Because take the appellum one, two, three was earlier.  Yeah.  I think he did the deep.  Didn't he do?  Was he in the deep?  Yeah, he was in the deep.  And then that was it.  And the hat.  He did the hat.  The hat.  The hat.  Yes.  He did the hat.  He put eggs in the hat.  You only last a couple more years, right?  What year did he die?  80.  The deep was before 80.  He died in 78?  Yeah.  Two years later. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  Two years later.  Yeah, it was really quick after that.  51.  Man.  Wait.  Wow.  Robert Shaw?  We're looking at a 48-year-old in that scene?  Oh, my God.  Was only 51 when he died, but he was 48 in choice?  Oh, my God.  Come on.  No.  47, if you think when they're filming it.  47 when they film, probably.  Do you know, I watched, it's funny, I watched an interview with Robert Shaw.  Get the fuck out of here.  From 1965, which was 10 years before Jaws.  I watched, it was very bad audio quality.  It's like a really rare interview from the BBC.  But he looks 30 years old. 
[03:20:30]  And I'm like, how the fuck is that?  Only 10 years.  Yeah.  I guess he had a fucking.  That was a tough 10 years.  He was hitting that bottle, I guess, for 10 years.  Oh, man.  Holy fuck.  Even the picture they're showing on the Wikipedia page, the black and white, he looks like he's  fucking 50 at that point.  That's hilarious.  That's old.  What year is that picture?  Old film.  71.  So 71 is eight years before he died.  So he's like 42, 43 in that picture?  Yeah.  Holy fuck. 
[03:21:00]  Something.  God damn, was he good, though.  See if you find him in the taking of Pelham 123 at all.  Because he was so good, and Travolta was so awful in that role.  How did Travolta do it?  Like, all crazy?  Yeah.  He was insane.  You know what?  Sometimes when you die like that, though, it's like you're a legend.  And if he would have lived to be older, trying to capitalize on that speech, and it's just  not as much impact.  He was talking about, like, yeah, we were at the carnival on the Ferris wheel. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, bro.  It stopped up at the top.  We couldn't get down for an hour.  My girl was screaming and hollering.  Like, it's just not as...  It doesn't have that fucking impact.  I dropped my cotton candy.  Do you ever see cotton candy, Chief?  When it falls out of a Ferris wheel, it tumbles and it'll rend.  It doesn't fucking hold the same.  Lands in the dirt.  But, I mean, another 10 years, he probably would have had some respectable roles.  Maybe.  I wonder what roles he would have had that other people got, obviously, because Shaw wasn't  around.  Maybe he'd have been weepy... 
[03:22:00]  Oh, God.  Yeah.  What's his name?  Fucking...  Batman.  Since there's not much else going on right now...  Michael Caine.  Yeah, Michael Caine.  He could have been weepy Michael Caine.  Would have had a few of Michael Caine's roles.  Yeah.  Over the years.  Yeah.  Who knows?  Alfred.  I tried to help him, Master Wayne, but I couldn't.  I couldn't.  You're the Batman.  You're a fat-faced Maggie Gyllenhaal.  She has fucking fat cheeks like a chipmunk cheeks. 
[03:22:30]  Katie Holmes is much hotter, even despite the sore on her lip.  The bat's signal hadn't been sent.  Oh, the police were underground, Chief.  And they were trying not to laugh in Bain's face with his sleep apnea mask.  They're going to be saying everything like that today. 
[03:23:00]  That's all I want to do is talk.  I just want to go down the hall and talk.  He said, I got it, I got it, I got it.  I got it.  Speaking of which, where's a shark when he needs us?  Are we doing the rest of the monologue or what?  You are.  Sure.  I don't know, man.  I kind of like it.  Hey.  What do you think?  Hit it.  I like when they start singing.  No reimbursement's been sent.  No, that was the time I was most frightened.  Waiting for my turn.  Waiting for my check. 
[03:23:30]  I'll never put on a life jacket again.  So, 1,100 men went in the war.  316 men come out.  The sharks took the rest.  June the 29th, 1945.  Anyway.  We delivered the bomb.  Yes, you certainly did.  Oh.  Very pleasant.  Yeah, it gets all nice.  Is it true the shark roars at the end of the movie? 
[03:24:00]  Does it?  No.  Mark in DC.  Mark, we have a comment on that, Mark?  I think he's just making a sound joke.  Oh, okay.  Mark.  Opie, I'm telling you, he absolutely roars.  I love that movie.  But at the end, he comes through the boat, you know, in the big scene where he sinks  the boat, and he roars.  In Jaws 4, people are saying.  No, no, no, no, no.  Jaws, the original.  No, wait.  Is it the scene where he eats Robert Shaw, or is it the very end when...  I told you, it's one of my favorite scenes ever, when fucking Scheider goes, smile, 
[03:24:30]  you son of a bitch.  I used to pretend when I was a kid that I was in the pool in Edison, and I would, like,  have my daydream fantasies about acting out movie stuff.  Oh, no.  And I would always daydream that I was fucking saving everyone in the pool from a shark,  and I was doing that line.  Oh, no.  I was young.  Were you trying to avoid missiles back then?  I said that when I'm going to spray a face shot in a girl.  Smile.  Smile, you son of a bitch.  Hit her in the mouth.  What did he keep saying?  Show me the... 
[03:25:00]  Show me the...  Show me the can.  Show me the tank.  Show me the tank.  But I would pretend that I was in the shallow end of the fucking...  The pool on a boat.  I hadn't explained why there was a boat in there, or why there was a shark in the pool.  Right.  But I would just save all the girls.  You wanted to be the hero.  I wanted to be the hero instead of piss-drinking faggot boy.  Could someone explain this?  It just says he started in the late 80s with Harrison Ford.  That's what the call screen says?  Yes.  What does that mean? 
[03:25:30]  Who's on the phones?  All right.  We're going to find the shark roaring.  He started.  Dave in Canada.  What's wrong with you?  What is this?  A Jeopardy question?  He started in the late 80s with Harrison Ford.  Who is...  Who is short round?  Yes.  Who is the director of...  What was that dumb Amish movie he did?  Oh, yeah.  Witness.  Witness.  Yes.  Yes, sir.  Dave, what do you got on this?  We got Dave.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  He was in a movie called Force 10 from Navarone with Harrison Ford, Carl Weathers, and Edward 
[03:26:00]  Fox in the early 80s.  So he didn't die in the late 70s.  Oh, Shaw.  Yeah, Robert Shaw.  He died in 78.  Dude.  No, he couldn't have.  The movie was made in like 82.  Dude.  He died.  He was dead.  He had to be dead.  The movie was obviously made before.  It was Robert Shaw.  Hilarious.  IMDB it.  I'm telling you the truth.  It's just a bit of trivia.  He was also the good-looking blonde spy in James Bond's From Russia With Love from Sean  Connery. 
[03:26:30]  Take a look.  All right.  All right.  Let's see what we got here.  I know my trivia.  You don't know your trivia.  You don't know your trivia.  He died in 1978.  He did die in 1978.  He died in 78.  Look at Force 10 from Navarone.  It was in like the early 80s.  Stop saying that movie.  Look for Force 10.  Maybe it came out then.  Maybe it was made earlier.  It came out in 1978.  78.  He played Mallory.  All right.  Dude, you don't know your trivia. 
[03:27:00]  You suck at trivia.  He was in the movie.  You're right.  I suck at trivia.  I'm from Canada.  Cut me some slack.  Oh, God.  We do have to grade on Curve.  He is from Canada.  Oh, me.  Way to go.  Idiot.  He converts dates, too, along with money.  Let's see.  It might have been funny if you didn't say converts.  Converts.  He converts.  Converts in Shirley.  Converts.  It converts and fucking, ugh, I stink.  And we're learning sharks do ramboats.  Do they?  Okay. 
[03:27:30]  What?  And where's the shark roar, Sam?  Stop fucking acting like you're Googling wrestling stuff.  Find this goddamn shark roar.  I don't know if he roars.  Find the shark roar.  Oh, there.  Jaws roar right there.  Cocksucker.  Let's see.  All right.  Let's see.  I'm going to chum of this shit.  It's labeled Jaws roar.  That's a joke.  That's a joke. 
[03:28:00]  The fact that Quint slides right down into the shark's mouth.  Yeah.  That was just, the sharks don't do that.  They don't understand the fucking, to knock, to tip the boat.  Yeah.  They don't know how to get treats.  Well, he was a smart fish.  He was a smart fish.  Yeah, he's a smart fish.  He runs on the habit trail.  Shark tipped the boat.  I slide down the boat.  He put the tank.  Yet the shark's not smart enough to not smile.  The shark's not smart.  He knows how to tip the boat.  Tip the boat.  He acts like a buoy, but he's not smart enough to not smile when the bullets are being fired 
[03:28:30]  at him.  Don't make the shark angry.  Don't get the panda angry.  Worst piece of production ever, man.  Wow.  On any radio show.  On any radio show.  Wow.  Worst ever.  Horrible.  I'll say horrible.  Would you say the producer is then technically the worst ever producer?  He produced the worst piece of production.  Right. 
[03:29:00]  Well, we made a big mistake, Sam.  That's obvious.  Figured it out yourself.  It is, right?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, my God.  Oh, distress signal had been sent.  Worst ever.  Worst ever.  Ever.  There's been so many.  Robert Plant, 64.  Fred Durst, 42.  There you go.  We did it all today.  See you tomorrow.  Is that it?  Come on.  Yeah, I think we're off.  Do we have anything else to plug?  I don't think we do.  I'm on Fallon tomorrow.  Are you?  I am.  Ooh.  I'm going to watch that. 
[03:29:30]  Me too.  Yes.  Jimmy Anorden on Jimmy Fallon.  Are you going to talk about how you got the same name?  I would do that.  Yeah.  If I was you.  I'm going to open up and go, when people would sing Jimmy Jimmy Coco Pop, did you also  think they meant you?  Because I did.  Did you?  I bet you did.  Oh, I have a plug.  Oh.  What do you got?  I want to thank Robert from Lake Charles.  L.A. is Louisiana, I guess?  Yes.  He sent me some socks. 
[03:30:00]  Oh.  Why?  That's the reaction I was hoping to get.  Ugh.  Why, you ask?  Oh, I can tell you why.  Big fan of the show.  And he says, besides being a subscriber, I want to find another way to say thank you.  Oh.  So I thought you could use some extra multi-purpose toilet rim cleaners, P-Mops.  That's nice.  That's nice.  By the way, I use my socks for the same purpose, too.  It's disgusting.  He sent you two packs of motherfucking Tootsie Warmers. 
[03:30:30]  This is to wipe the urine off the toilet seat.  Nice.  Nice.  Thank you.  And I guess I might as well keep plugging this, then.  Rotgut.  We're at K.J. Farrell's.  K.J. Farrell's in Belmore on August 31st.  That's the Friday of your great Labor Day weekend.  How come you're not in Bel-less?  Out.  Fuck.  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over.  Pretty much over. 
[03:31:00]  Pretty much over.  But if you feel like sticking around, After One Day Live is next.  Next.  Next.  Sirius X out.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After One Day Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, it is.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  866-WOW1-WOW.  What did you learn today? 
[03:31:30]  866-969-1969.  Rob, what did you learn?  I learned I'm five foot, five and a half.  That's all you learned?  I learned not to lie.  Did you?  I did.  You lied a lot today.  I know.  I was nervous.  Yeah, but it's like pathological.  It's so weird the way these intern semesters happen, because this is Rob's like last week.  This is my last week.  And Handsome Rob started this semester as like the guy. 
[03:32:00]  He was Mr., you know, hey, I'm throwing a pool party.  People are actually going to come, blah, blah, blah.  And everybody was making fun of, you know, Baby Kevi, whatever his name is.  Now, nobody's even talking about Kevi anymore, and you leave as the notorious intern this semester.  You have become the bad one.  Yeah.  Kind of.  And one day, you went from being, oh, okay, Rob, yeah, I remember that guy, he's cool,  to now you're the bad intern of the class.  You're the rotten apple.  Yeah.  How does that feel? 
[03:32:30]  How does the math feel?  He's pretty shitty.  You're the Matt, the intern of the class.  Really?  You're Love Buzz.  You know what I mean?  You're the shitty intern.  No, he's worse than Love Buzz.  He is.  That's what you're going to be learning.  You're going to be, oh, remember that intern we had that lied?  Like, that's your sort of thing.  That's what you're leaving with.  Is that I'll eat a cheese?  You lied about that.  I did.  You lie a lot.  I try not to.  Do you?  Yeah.  I mean, he's lying down. 
[03:33:00]  It's just, I don't know.  How come you lie?  I don't know.  It just kind of happens.  What do you mean?  Why wouldn't you just say what the truth is?  I don't know.  I just, I don't know.  You know, don't think.  Just answer the questions.  Maybe too many credit card swipes.  Is that even true?  That is true.  Did you do gay antics with your friends in your own boys' school?  I don't even know anymore.  I did.  It was a rough one for you today, huh?  It was pretty bad.  Sal, you really enjoyed it, though. 
[03:33:30]  Loving every second of it.  Now, you know what I learned today?  What?  Sal, you made the worst piece of production ever.  Oh, I knew that months ago.  In radio history.  In radio history, absolutely.  They said, of all the production pieces, and we've had tons of bad production pieces,  yours was the worst.  Yeah, we established this a month ago.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  We established that it was bad.  Being the worst of all time is way bigger than that.  Yeah, at least, I mean, I don't know.  At least he didn't lie.  At least I didn't lie for fucking three hours on the air today.  That's true.  He's talking about you, Rob. 
[03:34:00]  You lied for three hours.  But Rob provided content, so that's three hours.  Yeah, but they...  Yeah, but you're not supposed to lie.  Oh.  That's not good content.  Oh, bad.  Eric, did you know that this was going on with your intern class?  No, I had no idea.  I had no idea that this whole pool party was a farce.  It wasn't a farce.  It wasn't a farce.  And Rob told on Eric for downloading the pictures.  Remember?  He was here going, oh, this is what he did.  Yeah.  Is that a lie?  No.  That was just you writing out E-Rod.  Yeah. 
[03:34:30]  That's fine.  That's okay.  So it wasn't a farce.  The whole thing wasn't a farce.  No.  It wasn't.  Just every detail about it.  All details were.  Almost.  It got super weird in here.  You've got to understand that.  I've got to point out, when Sam...  We did over two hours.  We took a long break, came back, trying to wrap up your saga.  When you said something, and Sam just crossed his legs like he got kicked in the nuts, and  he goes, this just got really weird in here. 
[03:35:00]  I got freaked out, because we had kind of figured that what must have happened was, you  were going to throw this party, your parents didn't know about it.  So, that's why you didn't want your mom on the phone, you thought they were going to  be out of town, when you found out they were back in town, you were like, oh, we've  got to cancel the party.  You thought they weren't going to be there, when you found out they were going to be there,  you said, alright, cancel it.  Then, we didn't tell you this, we come in to confront you on it, and you go, well,  I lied, my brother moved on Saturday, not Sunday. 
[03:35:30]  What?  What are you talking about?  Like, the whole plan was to have a pool party.  Like, my parents were whatever with it, they were fine with it.  I just, I don't like my mom.  I loved my mom, but I don't, it was just, I don't know, I didn't want her to be on air  and stuff like that.  And then, I don't know, just things got, I really did think I could still pull it off  with, like, helping move my brother.  Everyone's looking at you differently now.  It's fine.  Everyone's like, oh, what?  That's the weirdo.  That's the weird intern. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  I know.  Roland, you enjoyed it.  Yeah.  You did?  Yeah, a little bit.  Do you think it was fun to see Rob get his comeuppance after all this?  It's funny, because he was like the guy for so long.  Yeah, very cocky.  And then, and then at the end, at the end of the day, you got it worse than any intern  in recent memory.  I don't remember the last time we had an intern nailed for two hours.  Two and a half hours.  Even Matt only got, like, a half hour.  We had that one intern with the lie detector.  That's right. 
[03:36:30]  That was the last lying intern.  I forgot.  We do have a whole series of liars that come through here.  I think we could put a special together at some point.  I think so, too.  You have that eye patch thing they were asking about, right?  Yeah, we have that.  But I did learn something, if you care to hear.  I do.  You're going to sneeze?  Okay.  I learned that this weekend, you and Roland had an amazing adventure that we didn't  get to hear about because of Rob.  We brushed on it.  It was just brushed upon it.  No, I wrote it down.  You talked, they talked for three minutes.  Yeah.  And then we went two plus hours on Rob's pool party. 
[03:37:00]  Because it just got so mind-bogglingly weird.  It was like a David Lynch movie in here.  It just nobody knew what way was up.  Like Lost Highway.  He's calling from another place, but he's really in the room next to you.  The whole, our whole, my whole perception of reality was skewed today.  I didn't know what was happening anymore.  Were you scared?  I was very scared.  Are you John Cusack in the mind of John Malkovich?  Yes.  Yes.  It was like that movie, Identity, where I find out that everybody around me is just  my own multiple personalities. 
[03:37:30]  It was just crazy.  I didn't know what was happening anymore.  Spoiler.  Sorry.  I'm sorry for all of you who were waiting to see Identity.  I've never seen it.  Well, you don't have to bother now.  You know the ending.  It's true.  You said that you weren't lying, though, in the beginning.  You knew you were lying.  Yeah.  How come you didn't?  It's just because, I don't know, I went, like, too far into it.  Yeah.  And it was just like, what am I going to do now?  Well, in the future, and maybe even right now, you just got to go, okay, look, I just  lied about a whole bunch of stuff.  But then I, like, came out pretty clean. 
[03:38:00]  I mean...  What?  What?  Came out pretty clean?  And what?  No one made eye contact with him when he left.  Eric, it's getting weird again in here.  What are you talking about, came out pretty clean?  Who thought you came out clean?  I don't know.  At the end of the day, you think you look okay after today?  We didn't get to the bottom of anything.  There's only more mystery.  We don't know what the deal with the party ever was.  There's mystery in my head.  I don't know.  We don't know why you lied about so much stuff.  I mean, I guess your mom drug tests you. 
[03:38:30]  That's...  I don't...  I don't know anymore.  I don't think you came out clean at all.  I think you're filthy.  You're sooty.  You look like a chimney sweep.  Cock-a.  Cock-a.  In a word.  You think you came out clean?  No.  Then why'd you say that?  I don't know.  Did the other interns get a kick out of it?  Yeah.  Kevin said he loved it.  And then he said something that didn't make any sense.  Has Kevi been waiting for Rob to be taken down a peg? 
[03:39:00]  He's been thrilled with this so that nobody thinks that he's the shitty intern anymore.  But he does suck.  Right.  He's horrible.  He doesn't do shit.  Wait.  Are you lying?  So you're upset.  You're kind of annoyed that now, even though Kevi sucks, you're the one who's like, that  was the weird intern.  I mean, I get it.  I understand.  Yeah.  But like...  It's frustrating.  A little bit.  Because you think Kevi is terrible.  He's horrible.  You do.  He does no work.  None.  He sat in the studio today.  That's it.  That's all he did?  That's it.  Eric, you didn't do anything today? 
[03:39:30]  He pulled some FU line drops and did some food runs, but I had nothing else for him today,  so I made him sit in here.  Why don't you just send him home?  Why is he still coming in?  This was last week.  So?  It's not like he's done anything.  He has never seemed to enjoy himself here.  Where's Kevi?  Bring Kevi in here.  Hold on.  Go in.  It's Kevi's last week.  I got to talk to Kevi.  You know, all these interns are saying goodbye.  Is this how you thought your last week would begin?  No.  Are you disappointed?  Yeah.  I'm going to make...  I am going to make it up by the end of the week. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  What are you going to do?  I'm not sure.  More cookies.  I don't know.  More lying.  Kevi, how do you feel about your internship ending?  So last week, you've done a lot.  You've seen a lot.  You kind of took the lead in the beginning of the internships as the weird intern.  And then you kind of...  I am a weird intern.  No.  Then you were kind of put on the back burner.  And then you pissed everybody off to the point that nobody wanted to put you on the air anymore.  So, how do you feel about your internship ending?  I enjoyed it.  You did?  I learned stuff.  The thing is, I didn't... 
[03:40:30]  I don't want to fuck up the national radio show that we're going on.  So, I did learn stuff.  After this one?  I did learn...  What's he talking about?  I have no idea.  What's that?  Are you talking about...  Wait, okay.  Everyone says I don't do anything.  Correct.  I do what I'm asked.  Right.  And I just don't go above and beyond that.  Okay.  So...  And you're saying that's because...  That's because I don't want to fuck anything up.  As opposed to saying you're lazy.  Because there's a system of checks and balances in place. 
[03:41:00]  I am lazy.  But that wouldn't be the word to describe it here.  Because if they want me to do it, I'll do it.  But you understand that even...  That interns that go above and beyond are generally rewarded.  Because, I mean, there's enough of us here that we would stop you from fucking up the show.  I guess.  By going above and beyond.  You didn't go above and beyond because you didn't want to.  You wanted to go home.  I asked you what you wanted to do.  You said, I want to take a nap.  It's early.  There was one time I gave him some stuff to do after the show. 
[03:41:30]  He said, do you have anything for me to do?  So I gave him something.  He came back a minute later and goes, yeah, I don't feel like doing this.  I'm just going to go home.  When was that?  Weeks ago.  But there was other people in the room when you said it.  So I said, give it to me and just go home.  That really is.  I mean, you're right.  You didn't go above and beyond.  I mean, I guess it didn't fuck anything up.  But it didn't do anything good for the show either.  Yep.  Okay.  Were you happy to see Rob go down in flames today? 
[03:42:00]  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit or a lot of it?  A lot of it.  You are?  I'm just trying to be subtle.  Why is that?  I don't know.  I just don't want to rub it in.  How come you were happy to see Rob go down today?  I don't know.  Yes, you do.  Because he brings in his cookies for his kissing ass and then they just go like, oh, you lying  son of a bitch.  Yeah.  Did you know he was a liar?  I don't know if they call him a lying son of a bitch.  I never would have pegged him as a liar.  You didn't realize?  Today, do you think he's a liar?  Absolutely.  You do.  How does that feel, Rob? 
[03:42:30]  Even Kevi is like, yeah, he's a liar.  Do you trust liars, Kevi?  No.  What do you think of liars in general?  I hate them.  You do?  Terrible.  The worst?  They're the worst.  Yeah.  Rob?  Comment?  Yeah, nothing.  Do you think you're a liar?  I lied today.  Many times.  Many times, yeah.  Do you think you're a liar?  In general, not really.  I really don't.  What's so funny, Sal?  I don't know how you could lie for two hours straight and be like, oh, yeah, I'd say it 
[03:43:00]  was like my first time I did it.  I mean, like, I used to lie a lot.  Used to.  I used to smoke a lot of weed and lie to my parents.  How long ago was that?  That couldn't have been that long ago.  Two years ago?  Yeah.  And then, like, I don't know, ever since then, I've just not, I've tried not to lie.  Do you think that maybe your perception of yourself is different than the reality?  That maybe you learned today that you really do lie a lot?  Totally could be.  Is that the reason your mom checks your phone all the time?  That she doesn't trust you?  No, she trusts me now. 
[03:43:30]  She shouldn't?  She's a fucking idiot if she trusts you.  She should listen to this break.  Would she be disappointed in you if she heard you on the show today?  Yeah.  She would be.  Oh, yeah.  Would she be like, why is my son lying like that?  Why wouldn't he just tell him the truth?  I don't know.  He didn't do anything wrong.  I don't understand where all the lies come from.  I know.  I just, I got nervous.  You got lost.  I got lost.  And just like.  But that's the creepy part.  That your instinct, like for me, if I was like lost or wanted to get out of something, 
[03:44:00]  I would just say, okay, I just tell him everything.  I'll just say everything that's the truth and then just see what happens.  Because at least then, but your natural instinct, even when you didn't do anything wrong, is  that you should lie.  No, it's, yeah, I guess.  No, yeah?  I don't know.  It's weird, isn't it?  Yeah.  Maybe you should see therapy.  Eh.  Eh.  What do you think?  It's not going to help.  Why not?  I don't know.  I tried that.  It didn't really help.  You went to a therapist?  I did.  Why?  Because my parents wanted me to like, this was when I smoked weed. 
[03:44:30]  Okay.  They like wanted me to go see a therapist.  Wow.  You really do have really like goody, goody.  Yeah.  Highfalutin parents.  So they sent you to a therapist because they caught you smoking weed?  Yeah.  Did they not realize that everybody smokes weed?  I tried to explain that to them.  You're like, look, I'll stop smoking weed, but you have to understand this is not for  crazy hippies anymore.  Do you, so your parents, you know, have they ever smoked weed?  No.  Never?  No.  My dad and mom don't drink.  At all?  No, barely.  Okay.  All right.  No, no, no. 
[03:45:00]  Listen, my dad has wine at like dinner and that's it.  My mom doesn't drink at all.  So your parents don't drink?  Mm-hmm.  But you had 30 beers in the house waiting for your party?  Yeah, because I drink.  So you just have, so do they don't, yeah, I mean.  They don't care if you drink alone in the house?  No, I'm usually not drinking alone.  I'm usually like, I'll have like two or three friends over, like guy friends, you know, watching  a game or something like that.  Okay.  Okay, so.  Um, and they, but that's because maybe you went to a therapist, so what, did the therapist  be like, so what, you're here because you smoke weed? 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, pretty much.  And then like, I had to like talk about what I did, stuff like that, and like, do I think  weed is wrong and shit like that.  This doesn't sound like, this sounds like a religious retreat.  No, I swear.  Sounds like one of those like, uh, turn gay people straight type of places.  Um, well, why don't you go to a therapist and be like, I don't know why I keep lying?  Because I, I don't know.  I, I can figure it out myself.  I think.  Why?  He lost weed.  He lied about smoking weed and then realized, oh my God, I got myself into such a situation  by now having to go to a therapist. 
[03:46:00]  Well, then what do you think the reason that you lie so much is?  I don't know.  I try to impress people, I guess.  Is that it?  Yeah.  But Rob, people are impressed by real people.  I know.  You know what happens every time.  Yeah.  They're like, what?  He's a liar.  I know.  How unimpressive is that?  Because I'll like, I'll say, I'll, I'll talk before I think.  And you'll be like, you know what would be cool?  If, and then you'll be like, hey, this is a fact.  Because I'll be like, I'll be like, no.  And then I'll, I'll mean yes.  But I don't know why I said no. 
[03:46:30]  And then, I think I'm fucked up.  And then you can't be like, oh, I meant yes.  You're like, you have to stick by the original no.  Yeah.  And you just write it into the ground.  Write it into.  Until Opie and Anthony are sitting there going, this isn't true.  And you're like, yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  Because you looked at me in the face.  I was like, there were no dirty text messages.  And you were like, yes, there were.  Yes, there were.  I mean, I text dirty to girls, but.  And then finally, you were like, no, no, there weren't any dirty text messages.  Do you think that just saying yes enough times would get people to be like,  I guess he's telling the truth.  No, I don't know. 
[03:47:00]  You got to stop lying.  Yeah.  It's terrible for you.  It's a terrible thing to do.  Do you lie, Kevi?  I actually don't lie that much.  No.  Because he doesn't do shit.  No.  So what's there to talk about, right?  Exactly.  I actually like even, I feel like if you just tell the truth, like, that's like the best  thing that can happen.  Because no one's ever going to be mad at you for telling the truth.  Right.  They'll be mad at you for not doing shit, like Rob said.  Right.  So what if Rob stopped lying and you started doing shit?  We would have a kick-ass team.  Right. 
[03:47:30]  Do you guys ever think of that?  Why don't you spend the week doing that?  Why don't you, Rob, not tell any more lies for the rest of the week?  Do you think you can do that?  Yes.  I do.  Yeah?  Definitely think I can do that.  Can I test him?  Okay.  Does Sal have puppet hair?  He does.  He does have puppet hair.  Sal's new nickname is puppet hair.  All right.  So you're not going to tell any more lies for the rest of the week.  That's right.  And I'm going to do, I don't know what, I don't know what, but I'm going to make it  up somehow.  Okay.  At least try to.  And Kevin, how about this?  I did that today.  How about for the rest? 
[03:48:00]  How about for the rest of the week?  You do shit.  Okay.  You're not going to do shit, are you?  If you tell me something to do, then I'll do it.  Eric, is he frustrating Kevvy?  Yeah, he is.  He still, he hasn't learned anything this semester, has he?  He'll do something when you give him an assignment, but then he either doesn't tell you that  it's done, or if it is done, he'll just stand there and stare and never takes the initiative  like, is there anything more I could be doing?  So you've seen these guys throughout the semester evolve. 
[03:48:30]  Has Kevvy evolved at all?  Has he learned anything, or is he the same schmuck who came in here?  Sort of the same.  He's not as, you know, fanboy-ish as when he started, but he's not very, he hasn't  been in, he hasn't been mobile at all.  Like, he'll just stand there.  So if he's lost, if he's changed at all, it's he's lost some of his passion.  Whatever little he had is gone.  Like that little bit of, holy shit, it's O&A, I gotta do good, is gone.  But I don't see it, I don't see him having passion about anything, even in his personal 
[03:49:00]  life.  He's a passionate guy.  Other than yelling about hockey on Twitter, he has nothing.  Why don't you get an internship with the NHL?  Okay.  See?  I'll do it if you tell me to.  Kevvy takes our breakfast orders in the morning, and this is the way he does it.  And this is, like today.  This is this morning.  This is literally one week left in the internship, so we're, I mean, he should have, the breakfast  order is something you perfect within the first couple weeks. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah, here's what he does.  Hey, do you want anything for breakfast?  Or Sam, today he gave me my breakfast, he goes, hey, I think they messed up, so if they  messed up, I'll go back.  I gotta go.  That's not at all how that went.  I said, dude, it was packed, like, if they messed it up at all, I'll go back for you.  That's exactly what I said.  But why would you think they messed it up?  And they did.  Because it was just packed.  It was, like, a madhouse. 
[03:50:00]  Dean on New York is always packed.  Would you ever think to check the food before you left?  Well, I can't open it.  Why?  I always ask the people if it's right.  And if they tell me it's right, then I just take the word for it.  They'll say yes just to get you out of the restaurant.  Of course.  What are they going to be like, here's your food?  And you'll be like, is it right?  And they'll be like, no.  No, it's not.  Why do you ask?  Roland comes up, I give it to him, he checks it.  If it's not right, I can go back downstairs and walk a couple stores away.  Going above and beyond would be watching them make it. 
[03:50:30]  I do watch them make it.  And then checking it.  There's other things.  You don't think so?  He's not an above and beyond kind of guy.  It was wrong, too.  It was wrong.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, there's no reason for it.  You know, you could watch them make it or you could check it before you leave.  And that way, it's just right.  Okay.  Okay, he says.  Did you hear him say okay?  But he walked in the other day to take my breakfast order?  Yeah.  And I looked at him and I said, I thought you were gone.  He's like, no.  No, I'm not. 
[03:51:00]  Well, there was a motion to have him fired.  Is everything okay from that?  I guess, yeah.  You haven't talked to anybody?  Nope.  No, you just came in?  Well, I talked to Eric a little bit and just like explained what was going on.  What was going on?  Well, his talking to me was, I got a text.  So am I coming back in or what?  I don't know what else to say.  Now, how about like, hey, I'm sorry or hey, is everything cool?  Should I come back?  This is what I would have done.  Why is it phrasing it?  I would have said, Eric, I'm really sorry about what happened on the air today. 
[03:51:30]  I get what you guys are saying.  I was wrong.  I'd really like to end, you know, the week strong.  I'd really like to end my internship strong.  Is it cool if I come back?  Instead of like, so what?  Am I still an intern or what?  Also, can I have Friday off?  Yeah.  He was excited to leave and plus he had to make sure that he was still able to take Friday off.  What'd you do on Friday?  I had to go back home and babysit my brother basically and watch my dogs.  How old's your brother?  18.  Which my mom does not trust him at all. 
[03:52:00]  She trusts you?  And she trusts you to be his caretaker?  I'm pretty irresponsible.  Really?  That's not the case.  You have not shown us one ounce of that.  What?  See?  And there's no sort of fight or anything.  No.  He's not a real ghost guy.  I don't know what to say to that.  Like, anything I say is just going to be like an argument and I might as well say okay  and then just like let you win.  Well, you kind of hope that I would sort of turn things around for you and be like,  you know what?  These guys are saying this.  So maybe I should try to step my game up a little bit and try to, you know, because 
[03:52:30]  I mean this is the way you're going to get through life, right?  I mean you're just going to kind of...  Or argue your point and then hopefully I'll be like, oh, you know what?  Maybe I misjudged.  Maybe you're right, Kevi.  I'm responsible in the fact that I do what I need to do.  Hardly.  Hardly.  You do the bare minimum.  Well...  Correct?  I really would like to know what else you people have in mind about that I don't do.  Well, I mean, I'll give you an example.  I mean, Rob took a beating today, but I got... 
[03:53:00]  And it's funny because I had to talk with Rob on Friday telling him like, hey man, you  really have done a good job and you've been kicking ass, yeah.  It's weird the way things just boom.  Everything's different now.  Yeah, but I do got to give it to Rob because Rob has come up with two ideas for bits that  are being produced right now.  That's right.  And it's not like it's complete.  Like, Rob came up with the kernel of an idea and then he started writing the script and  I was like, don't...  You know, I looked at what he was writing and I said, this is dog shit.  Don't give me any script.  But...  Still the idea.  I'll use the idea. 
[03:53:30]  Sure.  And that's something.  And it...  I mean, how many ideas have you submitted for production?  I haven't had any.  Okay.  Believe me, I've thought about it.  Well, the problem is...  You've thought about coming up with an idea.  I've thought about ideas, but I just never had one.  Three months without an idea is like...  That's like being brain dead.  Like, that's like a person in a coma would be that way.  Although a person in a coma in three months might wake up one time and have a single idea.  There are people in comas who have had more ideas than you over the last three months. 
[03:54:00]  This is true.  You know what I mean?  Like, um...  I mean, I don't...  Most...  I've...  I've, like, thought about, like, other ideas, too.  And then, like, I wouldn't just...  I mean, yeah, these two, like, got passed, but it's like, I've, like, thought about other  stuff, and, like, I've presented it to Sam or Sal or something like that, and it just  didn't go through.  It's not like...  But at least he...  I was, like, trying to take the initiative.  Yeah.  At least he stepped up and tried to do something.  I mean, he's a liar, but at least, right?  Yeah.  Bad liar.  So, Kevi, I mean, I don't think you're gonna go anywhere with this internship, but maybe 
[03:54:30]  going forward, can you take some of these lessons with you?  Or is this...  Is this sort of in one ear at the other territory?  Oh, no, I'll do better.  Will you, or are you just saying things to...  I know, I will.  I definitely will.  What do you think?  And now I know what I need to do, like, from the start.  Yeah.  Well, I think he really blew this bad.  Like, he had an amazing opportunity here.  He's in the building.  You know, I mean, this is a good company, and, you know, there's a lot of people here that  are powerful, and he just totally fucking blew it.  You think so? 
[03:55:00]  Absolutely.  And who, like, who on the staff would give him a good review for his internship?  I mean, I gave my review just now on the air, so...  Yeah.  It wasn't great.  No, it's awesome.  I gotta be honest.  It wasn't.  Would you have hired him based on what I just said?  Never.  Okay.  All right.  Well, I mean, I don't make the hirings and firings, but Larry in New York.  Hey.  What's up?  You guys treat your interns like crap.  Who does?  You in Iraq.  You treat them like crap.  I mean, you complain about Ron and Fev, how they have great interns, and you have crappy 
[03:55:30]  interns.  They treat their interns with a little respect.  You guys don't.  We do treat our interns well, but...  Why were you banned from having interns?  Iraq and me weren't, and we have them back now, and we've had them back for some time.  If we were...  Why were you guys banned from having interns?  Because one intern had a problem with one thing, and the person who he had a problem with  has nothing to do with the interns.  So you're telling me you treat your interns with dignity and respect?  When they deserve it. 
[03:56:00]  When they deserve it.  I mean, we treat them like human beings.  If somebody...  No, you don't.  If somebody is not good at their job, then you don't say, hey, you're doing a good job.  You say, look, you gotta do a little better.  No, you don't, but you're trying to encourage them.  Yeah, that's what I've been doing the whole time.  Do you listen to this show ever?  Do you listen to anything?  I listen to it all the time.  All right, then you would hear, I've consistently, I've consistently told them that they can  do better, what they can do, what I did, what they should be doing, and you know what happens?  You have Kevi in here, you have Kevi in here, who's looking at me like I'm speaking a foreign 
[03:56:30]  language, like this is the first time I've said any of this to him.  But you tell them in a backhanded way.  Number one, number one, Larry, number one, it's on the air, so you do it with...  I'm not just going to sit here and talk to...  Off the air, I don't put on a show.  This is an entertainment show, so you have to do it in a way that the listeners find  entertaining as well.  That's fantastic, but you don't do it at other people's expenses.  Of course you...  What the fuck are you listening to?  The Opie and Anthony doesn't have humor at other people's expenses? 
[03:57:00]  You talk to me like this to my face.  Larry, you just said the Opie and Anthony show...  I'm going to come down there and kick your ass.  Yeah, kick my ass then.  You just said the Opie and Anthony show...  Does it?  That's Troy, Stephen.  Troy, oh my God.  That was E-Rock.  I'm going to come down to his face.  Listen, you just said the Opie and Anthony show doesn't entertain people at other people's  expenses.  How long have you been listening for?  Did you hear Friday?  Turn on Scott and Todd.  Did I say Opie and Anthony?  Did I say Opie and Anthony?  This is a reflection of their show. 
[03:57:30]  This is what we do.  Turn on Scott and Todd.  You'll get a laugh.  Turn over to Kavino and Rich.  Yeah, you'll get a laugh out of those guys.  They didn't make sure that everybody's having fun, but nobody's feelings are hurt.  I'm Opie and Anthony.  But Sam, in all honesty, you've given Kevi talks, very important talks off air.  Not everything, not every criticism happens on air.  You spent, what, a half hour talking to him one day, trying to motivate him.  And at the end of the day, he says, I want to take a nap.  Right.  Like, up until now, up until, like, today, pretty much, I, like, felt like I was a part  of the staff, even though I know I'm not. 
[03:58:00]  Look at that.  Like, I, but, like, it's just, like, I, I felt like I was respected and stuff.  You were included.  Yeah, I was included.  I was respected.  And then, I mean, a little bit respected, but.  That's out the window at this point.  I mean, when you lie all the time.  Larry, what do you do for a living?  I'm a system analyst.  Yeah, I guess, so, if you come from a world where there's no ball busting, that's fine.  Even in the medical world, they ball bust their intern's balls.  I come from a world where people are treated with respect.  If they give it, they get it.  That's the point!  If they give it. 
[03:58:30]  That's what I'm saying.  And if they don't give respect, if Kevi's over here not respecting people, he's going  to get yelled at, correct?  See, but you're looking at it through rose-colored glasses.  You're wondering why the other people have good interns and you have crappy interns.  You try, you guys treat your interns like shit?  No, I think that's the person that's picking the interns.  Yeah, I mean, if you want to talk about E-Rock picking interns, you can talk about E-Rock  picking interns.  But you've been, don't go back to your original point that was just disproven, when Rob, a  minute ago, is an intern who just said he was respected and not treated like crap. 
[03:59:00]  If the interns themselves are saying, I am not treated like crap, where's your argument?  Okay, you're right and I'm wrong.  I am right and you are wrong.  Larry, what happens if you work with somebody that's incompetent and they're not doing their  job right?  Are you just going to sit there and be friendly with them and tell them how great everything  is?  Maybe they should be shifted to a job that they are competent at.  They're interns.  How far down the ladder can you shift them?  I mean, they're working for free.  And they can't even do that.  They're working for free, so you shouldn't be treating them like crap. 
[03:59:30]  I mean, we're not hazing them.  He's a maniac.  I mean, they come here to learn and if they're not doing anything, they're not learning  anything.  What's the point?  But back in the day, it was way worse when I interned.  Yeah.  Because I messed up.  They threw away my lunch.  My intern boss whacked me in the back of my head.  Nobody's gotten whacked.  We take it.  Have you ever gotten whacked, Kevvy?  Have you ever gotten smacked?  Nope.  That's right.  I have many times.  Yeah, you've gotten smacked.  You probably deserved it.  Fuck you.  Kevvy's just got rich parents that'll probably bail him out of everything. 
[04:00:00]  I don't have rich parents at all.  I don't think Kevvy does.  No?  I don't know.  Yeah, he's just...  My mom works three jobs.  Yeah, so...  Well, it seems to me, because you're not hustling, because if you didn't have everything...  I'm doing what I'm supposed to do now.  No, you're not.  Like, hardly.  You show up hardly.  How is that doing what you want to do?  I show up hardly?  Well, you want off all the time.  I don't want off all the time.  You want to leave early.  I took off one day this entire semester.  You want to leave early.  You want to leave early, right?  You don't want to sit here and work.  You don't have the initiative to sit here and see what you're going to do.  If there's something to do, I'll do it.  But most of the time, there's nothing to do.  Come up with ideas. 
[04:00:30]  You're not doing that.  Do you think you're disrespected around here, Kevi?  Oh, yeah, I'm just going to sit here and just force myself to come up with an idea that  I don't have.  Yes, that's the idea.  That is kind of the idea.  Do you think you're disrespected and that's the...  I mean, yeah.  We're definitely not, like, respected.  Do you think you should be?  Do you think you don't get the respect you deserve?  No, this is my thing.  I'm nice to everyone here.  Right.  But it's just, like, all you guys do is just rip on me, which I understand is for  the show, but when it's off the show, it's just kind of, like...  Do you not see the frustrations that occur when we're like, hey, Kevi, why don't you 
[04:01:00]  do this or that?  And you just kind of stare blankly and say, okay.  If you ever say, like, do this or that, then I'll do it.  But you never give me examples.  I've told you to come up with ideas.  Like, just come up with something.  Just think outside the box a little bit.  I've given you tasks, and you do them eventually.  Eventually.  Yeah, eventually.  You don't think you take a long time to do tasks?  I do take a little bit of time to do tasks.  I mean, you get them done eventually.  But I still do it.  This is what I'm saying.  Like, you guys are acting like I don't do anything ever. 
[04:01:30]  Well, Rob...  But I do do what I'm supposed to do.  Rob said you don't do anything.  Your fellow interview.  Okay.  Is that right, Rob?  I mean...  But Rob has also, Kevi, and you're...  I lie.  On your side, Rob has been known to lie about a lot of things.  So he may be lying about this, too.  Like, I mean, I don't see him really working.  Like, I...  Because you're doing phones.  When I go in there, that means I'm not working.  Yeah, but he's in there for at least a good two, two and a half hours from the show. 
[04:02:00]  I'm normally never in there.  Today was, like, one of the...  He was in there for a very long time.  Eric had nothing for me to do.  But, like, just figure something out.  Eric, you gotta start coming up with some stuff for these interns to do.  Yeah, so should everybody else.  Because I gave them stuff, and when they complete, I don't have anything else for them.  I make them sit in here for now.  You're the boss, though.  Like, ask around.  Ask Sal.  Ask Troy.  Yeah, it's like...  It's not...  Just...  Well, it's like, you gotta be careful what you give them, because you really can't handle  too much.  Yeah.  In fairness, Kevi does ask me if I have it. 
[04:02:30]  But if I'm doing my own thing, and I can just do it quicker myself, sometimes it's easier  just to do that, you know?  I guess maybe the problem is Kevi's not getting taught how to do stuff then, because you should  be able to depend on somebody like Kevi to do it.  That's why he's here.  I will admit, I usually revert to Rob for...  You don't get taught enough?  It's okay if you don't.  I mean, if you don't get taught enough, then that's not your fault.  I'm just, like...  I think the thing is, like, I'm pretty slow at most stuff that people could do faster  than me.  Mm-hmm. 
[04:03:00]  So...  Shouldn't you try to develop some of those skills?  I try.  I try, but I don't really have, like, the opportunity to do that.  Initiative or drive.  Motivation.  Listen, I'm going to tell you about Steven Singer.  Let me tell you about Steven Singer and Steven Singer Jewelers.  Is there anyone better out there for diamonds than him?  I think I can answer that question.  No.  Nobody even comes close.  In fact, Steven is the best place to buy your diamond in America.  It's absolutely the only place to go for your engagement ring.

Go see Steven Singer in Philly at the other corner of 8th and Walnut on the phone at 1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER  or online at IHateStevenSinger.com.  Maybe that's what you need, Kev.  He has jewelry.  Might help me feel better.  Maybe.  If you had some bracelets or something.  Yes.  He has all kinds of...  Maybe you get some kind of blinged-out necklace that just says Uncle Kev on it. 
[04:04:30]  I should do that.  Just start peacocking around here.  Do you have a special lady in your life?  Not at the moment, no.  No?  You like girls, though, right?  Not sure.  I'm kidding, yes.  It gives you a little motivation.  The pussy doesn't give you motivation?  Like, I gotta go get some shit done?  You know, you're in a weird spot right now.  You're a little depressed.  Yeah.  You gotta pick yourself up.  I see that.  I mean, it happens.  I would like to...  I mean, every time I talk to you, I feel like, okay. 
[04:05:00]  I feel like he's confident in his actions.  And he's confident that he can get there.  And now I get motivated again to work with you and try to get the best out of you.  But then I feel like I'm gonna get frustrated again.  Do you think we can make an effort at this?  And you can be...  I want...  What if you are most improved intern?  We could do it this week.  You can be most improved intern.  And liar over there can be bottom of the barrel.  Okay.  Because right now, here's the way I see it.  Okay?  You've had a tough semester as bottom rung on the intern letter. 
[04:05:30]  Connor, our other intern, is back there.  But he is just in the middle for his life.  Like, that's where Connor is intended to be.  And that's where he always will be.  Just right there in the middle.  Tell Connor I'm sorry if he takes any offense to that.  Say I'm sorry if you take offense to that.  I'm good with him.  It's fine.  He's fine.  Exactly.  He's cool where he is in the middle.  This is your moment of greatness, Kevi.  Like, Connor is there to be leapfrogged.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, he's on cruise control.  It's a good, it's a decent speed. 
[04:06:00]  He's getting what needs to be done, done.  But it's cruise control.  Meaning, if you start pumping the gas, you can drive right past him.  So, you look at Rob, and you see an opportunity.  Rob came on the air today, and for two hours, he looked Opie and Anthony dead in their eyes  and lied to them.  Right?  Did he not?  He did do that.  He absolutely did, right?  Was it disgraceful?  A little bit.  It was.  You look up to Opie and Anthony, correct?  Yeah.  And to see somebody spit in the face of your radio idols, what was that like? 
[04:06:30]  It was disgusting.  Disgusting, right?  It's horrible, right?  It's terrible.  Yeah, and not exactly the behavior of the number one intern of the class, is it?  It is not.  It is not.  So, Kevi, this is your moment of greatness.  This is your time to shine.  What do you say we get back on the horse, we make you most improved intern, and you  leapfrog over Connor, become number one, and leave Rob as bottom of the barrel?  What do you say?  Are we going to get it done?  Yeah, let's do it. 
[04:07:00]  Yes!  There's some enthusiasm.  Eric, do you think I can do this?  Do you think we can do this?  No, but yes.  Eric, without your confidence.  I'm sorry, I was lying.  Yeah, I think you can do it.  I think you can do it.  Do you think you can do it, Kevi?  Eric thinks you can do it.  Sure, I can do it.  I think you can do it.  Now, I'd like to have a little talk with Rob.  You would?  Yeah.  What kind of a talk?  Well, Rob, you've got a week left.  You fucked up big time today.  You look like a real asshole.  Yeah, real horse's patoot.  Yeah, and you were so strong.  Because last week, remember, we had that talk? 
[04:07:30]  No, it made me feel so good, too.  What did you talk to him about last week?  I told him, because he came up with these ideas, and I said, hey, man, good job.  These were really good ideas, and you gave Sam a little something to work with, and Sam  put something together, and these are going to be good pieces.  These were your ideas.  I said, good job.  Keep up the motivation, and keep going with it.  Little did you know.  Little did I know.  Then he's going to make me out to look like a fucking asshole, because he comes in here  and does his bullshit this morning.  I know he's probably sitting in there going, well, Troy said he was cool.  Yeah, exactly.  I thought he was cool.  Exactly.  But, so there's four days left to the internship for these guys, right? 
[04:08:00]  Four days.  Okay.  In the next four days, I want you to think about how you can win back the hosts of the show.  What are you going to do?  Are you going to bring them breakfast in the morning?  Are you going to, what are you going to do?  Maybe you bring them treats every day.  You think treats?  No.  Like a pizza, something like that.  Maybe you have a hot girl that'll come in and get naked for them.  That would really win them over.  That would be huge.  Right?  If you're like, hey, I brought this broad in to get naked for you guys, will you guys  forgive me for my bullshit yesterday? 
[04:08:30]  This bitch is going to show off her butthole.  And pussy, too.  Yeah.  Something like that.  I'll definitely, that's just, that's definitely good, yeah.  So this is your time to really step up and think about how you're going to fix this problem.  But, Kevi.  I got you.  You have to have your eye on Rob.  Because every minute that Rob steps up, you have to be stepping up a little bit further.  Because now we're, basically, we know that Connor is going to finish in the middle.  That's where he's going to land.  Connor is going to land in the middle.  Eric, make sure Connor doesn't take any offense to me saying he's permanently going to land in the middle. 
[04:09:00]  Sam means no offense to you about being permanently in the middle.  I'm not going to be in the middle.  Yes.  You tell me.  You're going to be in the middle.  Yeah, tell me.  No, this time he is.  Yeah, he is, for sure.  Now you're turning into Rob and you're lying.  Yeah, he's definitely going to, but tell him that's okay for him.  But that's okay for you.  Oh, okay.  Okay, cool.  Now, we've got a first and a last place to deal with.  Make it you, Kevi.  You're going to be my guy.  Okay.  Troy and Rob are going to try to get back on their horse, but I think you could do it.  Do you think you could do it? 
[04:09:30]  I could do it.  Roland, who's it going to be?  Rob.  You think so, even though he's a liar?  Yeah.  He's a filthy liar.  Eh, what are you going to do?  He's a young fella.  I guess, but so is Kevi.  Kevi's got youth on his side, too.  But Rob drinks.  I'm young, so.  You're younger.  I am younger.  You've got more fire in you.  I do.  And you don't lie.  But Rob drinks, so he is my bow.  He doesn't have more fire than Rob.  He's not, but Rob lies more.  He's like mediocre, warm.  But that means Rob's more creative.  See, Rob's going to take the blow. 
[04:10:00]  He's going to pick himself up.  He's going to come back in strong tomorrow.  I see.  So Rob is, the harder they fall, whatever, the more they get back up.  Rob's Paul Ryan.  Paul Ryan didn't fall.  No.  He's just running for vice president.  He does P90X.  Yeah, P90X.  That's tough.  That doesn't make any sense.  Never follow Roland's advice.  We've got to go.  Ron and Fe...  ...are coming up next.  We'll be back with more of this tomorrow.  Good luck to you, Kevi.  Thank you.  Good luck, Rob.  You got this, buddy.  All right, goodbye.  Let's go.
