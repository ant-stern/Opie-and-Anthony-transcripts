<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts defiantly declaring radio's freedom from niceness, followed by rambling discussions about elusive, unfamous rock stars and Kiefer Sutherland's drunk driving sentence.  They recounted a drunken Christmas tree incident before pivoting to a gas tanker explosion in Everett, Massachusetts, and a mall shooting in Omaha, Nebraska.  Listener calls, including prank calls referencing past segments, punctuated their reactions to these news stories, alongside discussions of ineffective mall security, a naked man on a bridge, and a woman's unusual physique.  The hosts inappropriately laughed at news reports about Owen Wilson's suicide attempt and a fiery car crash, and also commented on racial bias in media coverage.  The segment concluded with more listener calls, announcements of upcoming in-studio guests Bill Burr and David Tell, and further off-topic conversations. Bill Burr was indeed a guest in studio.

The show continued with a discussion of a celebrity's jail sentence, crude estimations of his remaining time, Led Zeppelin's repetitive album remasterings, and the excessive media coverage of the New England Patriots' undefeated season, contrasting it with other successful teams.  The hosts debated the relative importance of an undefeated season versus a Super Bowl win, speculated on Bill Belichick's strategies, and engaged in trash talk about rival teams (Ravens, Colts).  The conversation then abruptly shifted to the "Jessica Simpson factor" influencing Tony Romo's performance, using crude and sexually explicit language.  The mall shooting was revisited, leading to a detailed, often crude discussion of assault rifles, self-defense, and the hosts' gun ownership. This sparked a debate on violent video games, referencing a US prosecutor's list of games to boycott, and using historical examples of violence to challenge the correlation between violent video games and violent crime.  The discussion extended to the dangers of interacting with children in public, with humorous, exaggerated scenarios illustrating anxieties around potential accusations of impropriety.  Callers shared personal anecdotes about hunting and avoiding interactions with children in public restrooms. The segment concluded with mentions of upcoming events, including stand-up comedy shows and a book signing, with further caller discussions on gun ownership further highlighting the segment's themes.

A subsequent segment began with a mention of a holiday-themed video featuring a past show guest later caught in a *To Catch a Predator*-style sting.  The hosts discussed comedian Greg Hughes's encounter with a "bait" girl from the show, followed by a humorous YouTube video, "Wussy Skater Fight." This led to a broader discussion about online videos of crying children.  In-studio guest David Tell recounted being mistakenly targeted by another comedian, transitioning into a discussion about the challenges of performing comedy for different audiences, sharing anecdotes from his performances for US troops in Iraq.  A listener called to discuss the stronger Canadian dollar, leading back to Tell's upcoming HBO special.  The show's intern, Renee, announced her departure for a job at Z100, prompting good-natured ribbing from the hosts. The segment concluded with promotions for David Tell and Bill Burr's shows and a farewell to Renee, followed by off-air chatter about Jim's age and plans.

A segment featuring Lou, Amy Fisher's husband, began with anecdotes about the hosts' impatience with elderly people and Anthony's boasts about his reckless driving habits. A caller challenged Anthony's attitude towards traffic laws. Lou, described as a large, intimidating man, was introduced. The conversation centered on a pornographic video Lou and Amy made that was accidentally released and gained unexpected popularity. Lou detailed his past as a police officer, his current work as a video producer, and his celebrity encounters.  He discussed his relationship with Amy, including the challenges posed by the video's release, how they met (via AOL), and Amy's past.  The conversation contained numerous sexually explicit references and descriptions of the video, its production, its sexual content, and its reception. Lou also discussed his physical fitness and experiences with celebrities.  The segment concluded with promotional information for the video and further discussion of Lou and Amy's relationship.

The final segment heavily featured discussion of the Amy Fisher sex tape, described in explicit detail and including humorous anecdotes, such as one involving Lou Ferrigno.  The hosts also promoted Bill Burr's upcoming HBO special, and extensively discussed a 1998 news report about water-powered car inventor Stan Meyer and his mysterious death, speculating about foul play by oil companies.  The segment included sexually explicit jokes, crude humor, and offensive language. A sound effect guessing contest and a New Year's Eve ticket giveaway were mentioned.  Other topics included listener-submitted "lines of the day," discussions of other comedians (Jimmy Norton and Fez), and commentary on media personalities like Ellen DeGeneres and Jenna Bush. The show concluded with promotions for upcoming events and the "punch out" catchphrase. Amy Fisher was expected as a guest the following day.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shock, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talkshow radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shotjox, Opie and Anthony.  Testing 1-2-1-2.  Poe, poe, boo, boe, banana, nana.  Banana, fanna, foe, foe, fee, fi, mo, mo.  Poe!  Who thought you were dead?  The people you were fighting with?  Seals, yeah.  dealers and stuff, and they just threw them in a dumpster 
[00:01:00]  in London. Well, you know, I left them there.  I think it's pretty funny when no one wants to get rock star.  This is where entertainment is going.  I shot my computer. You can't  shoot guns in suburbia. And I  fully expected the police to show up.  This is showing responsibility.  Opie and Anthony. I think worse than having  sex with a man would be, as you're kissing  one, to feel his manhand holding  your head like the sweat of a  manhand right on the face of your neck.  This is the worst  show I saw.  This is the worst show I've ever been on. 
[00:01:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Is it time for another Opie and  Anthony show already?  It seems to be. Boy, they seem to  creep up every  day or so. Day after.  Every 24 hours.  Day after. Oh boy, don't say  every 24 hours. Why? 
[00:02:00]  You're going to make Travis very sad today.  What?  His hero's going to jail for 48  hours. Oh, 48 days.  48 days, right? 48 days  for 24 star  Kiefer Sutherland.  I know. He was feeling pretty bad.  Kiefer Sutherland's  going to jail for 48 hours.  I keep saying 48 hours.  Well, when you hear 48  hours. 48 hours.  The dumb TV show.  Yeah, 48 days.  And Travis is convinced that  like he's  he's going to break out 
[00:02:30]  and, you know,  he'll be on the run.  But he'll  he'll be OK  and he'll somehow  be able to clear his name  or he'll do something to save the country  and they'll pardon him.  Yeah.  Like Travis has a hard time  distinguishing reality  from fantasy.  You realize that Kiefer  is just a little sissy  having a few belts  before he gets in the car.  Loves drinking and driving,  does he?  Among other things.  How bad  was his drinking  that he gets 48 days? 
[00:03:00]  He got a really F up  to get 48 days.  He's done it a few times.  But he didn't crash into anyone.  He didn't kill anyone.  Thank God.  No, it doesn't.  It doesn't matter.  He's done this too many times.  It's just one of those  too many times things.  He did take out a Christmas tree once.  Not with a car, but  With his body.  He was just hammered  in the lobby of a hotel  and decided to throw himself  drunk into a Christmas tree.  I kind of did that  back in the day.  At the BAB Christmas party  I jumped into the tree.  Why would you do that?  Oh, because I was  the outrageous night guy.  Oh, so you gotta be crazy. 
[00:03:30]  I gotta be crazy night guy.  Oh, he's  he's uncontrollable.  You don't know  what he's gonna do next.  Crazy man.  Phone number  877-212-ON-A  You got the  ONARadio.com  That's where all the links  will be for anything  we talk about  that's visual today.  We got  Wow.  The phone's ringing  like crazy.  And we got lots  to talk about today.  I need to find out  more about this  gas tanker explosion  in the Boston area.  I believe it was 
[00:04:00]  in Everett.  So if you're listening  on BCN right now  please  I was just  I was just perusing  BostonHerald.com  You were perusing it.  Perusing a little bit.  You should read.  Ah, I like to just peruse.  I just like to pick up  on some key words  like gas, explosion,  fire, tornado,  triple decker, destroyed.  A fire tornado.  Yeah.  That's scary stuff.  It sounded cool, man.  It sounded like  they were filming a movie 
[00:04:30]  but this was real life.  Some guy  how many gallons  he just filled up  his tanker  right to the tippy top.  Right to the tippity top.  This guy fills up  his tanker  to the tippity top.  You couldn't get  another drop of gasoline  in this tanker  or whatever it holds.  What, 9,000 gallons?  You want to go there?  Wow.  Is that about right?  That's a lot of gas.  I'm guessing.  Yeah.  Is that too much?  No, 9,000  for a tanker truck?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think  that'll fit that.  Is that about right?  Yeah.  Sounds good. 
[00:05:00]  I don't know  if the guy fell asleep  or what  but somehow  the tanker now  flips over  and explodes.  Okay?  Now there's a  river of fire  in Everett  just like  just rolling  into everything.  Yeah,  because it's still liquid  so it's pouring  down the street  like water would  during a rainstorm  but it's on fire.  You know,  I'm going to have  to tell everyone  how much of an idiot  I am today.  I'm thinking  I'm talking about  a nice little 
[00:05:30]  local story.  I want to be local  for Boston  and everyone  listening on BCN.  It's on CNN.com.  It's like the top story.  Oh yeah,  people love tanker fires.  So then I guess  it was a tornado of fire  just rocking down the street  and then it was  a river of fire  and this is the cool thing  about the river of fire.  It was going under cars  and as it went under each car  the cars are now exploding.  Sure.  And no one  died.  An action movie.  I think it happened  in the middle of the night  or something like that  so everyone was okay. 
[00:06:00]  Sam just ran in  some audio of this.  This story  was pretty damn amazing,  man.  Yeah,  it was in Everett.  Okay.  Here's the news story  for everybody.  We'll start with this today.  Overturn tanker  and go.  More than 100 Everett residents  were sent running for safety  when a tanker truck  overturned at the traffic circle  at routes 16 and 99  sending a river of burning fuel  into the streets.  Calls came flooding in  to 911 at 135 in the morning. 
[00:06:30]  There's a fire on the road  and the oil truck  blew up.  The oil truck blew up?  Yes.  Do you see anybody's shirt?  I don't know.  The hole,  it's spread in the hole.  There's a big fire.  There's a big fire.  There's a big fire.  That sounds like the bra  that wanted  the Donna Summer tickets.  Lingy Lingy.  Wow.  Can you imagine?  No.  Presidents  of these two apartment buildings  also called 911  when they saw the flames. 
[00:07:00]  When the fire approached  and caught their buildings on fire,  they had to cut the conversation short  and run for their lives.  Get out!  Get out!  Get out!  Hello?  Yeah, I think you're  making it on the house  trying to get people out  out of the house.  Okay.  Some officials say  it's a miracle.  No one was killed  in that accident.  How cool is that?  A real miracle  would be that  it didn't happen.  Yeah, that's true. 
[00:07:30]  That baby Jesus  got involved  and made sure  that didn't happen.  Yeah, it didn't happen at all.  Especially this time of year.  Yeah.  You want the baby Jesus miracles.  Yeah, around the holiday season.  Let's go to Jim in Boston  listening on BCN.  Jim, what's up?  Yeah, Duffy was driving the truck  and he came around that corner  and he just lost the whole thing.  It was a towering inferno.  Bad news.  Yeah, was the guy  just going too fast  in the traffic circle?  Those traffic circles  sucked to begin with, but...  Oh, it was a nightmare.  Nightmare. 
[00:08:00]  Duffy was all done.  Who's Duffy?  Are you trying to do  a little bit, bro?  Who do you think  you're talking to today?  No.  Who's Duffy then?  Yeah, who is it?  Go ahead.  He's just a guy out here.  He's known in that area  and he's just...  Sir, sir,  are you trying to do a prank?  You can tell us now  because I don't know  who Duffy is.  No one does.  We have a Duffy here.  It's an inside joke.  Huh?  He's part of the truck.  He was just with the truck.  He was the driver.  It was all over the news.  Oh, yeah?  His name's Duffy.  That's what the news said. 
[00:08:30]  And Duffy's known to do this.  I guess.  I don't know.  That's what the news said.  All right.  Thanks, bro,  for being an ass.  Carl in Boston.  Guy's named Duffy.  He's silly.  Dumb Eric Googling it.  Huh?  What's up, Carl?  Hey, the tanker  apparently was going  too far into the rotary.  Apparently, they were on the phone  with a radio show  and he passed me  and he was throwing  a bag of some sort  of substance at the window  and the radio hosts  were getting a kick out of it.  Linger under. 
[00:09:00]  I should have known  our listeners would  take this opportunity  to just mess with us.  Of course.  Referring to a bit  we did, I don't know,  over a year ago now  where a husband and wife team  were driving around  the country,  you know, truckers and  long-haul truckers  in the cab of their truck  and they explained  how they have to do things  when they're in the middle  of nowhere  and this girl  kind of demonstrated  by doing something  into a bag.  Into a plastic bag.  It was great.  And then she kind of  sealed up the bag real nice  and just decided  to keep throwing it 
[00:09:30]  against the window  of the truck.  Well, we had kind of  asked her to do that  so we could get  an audio thing.  Being radio,  you need some audio  so it made quite the  ker-splat sound  hitting the window.  All right, so we'll get  more on that story  but just an amazing story  up there in Boston  today in Everett.  Then you got the mall guy.  Mall guy.  This little selfish,  spoiled brat.  Not even spoiled.  He was just angry.  What a creep. 
[00:10:00]  Where was this?  Omaha?  Omaha mall madman  kills eight  in Holiday Nightmare.  It's on the front page  of our paper today.  I guess this guy,  Hawkins, 19,  broke up with his  girlfriend.  Yeah.  Been kicked out of his  home and got fired  from McDonald's.  This guy had one hell  of a life going for  himself.  Nothing going on.  So he decided to go to  a mall and kill people.  Yeah.  That's pretty much what  it comes down to.  Why shoot innocent people?  Shoot some people.  Because he said in his 
[00:10:30]  suicide note that he  wanted to go out in style  and he goes,  I'm going to be famous.  He wanted to be a  somebody.  Well, the media,  once again,  I guess you have to  report the news,  but it's such a weird  line because now his  picture is everywhere.  You gave him his wish.  You really did.  And maybe somebody else  that's feeling a little  similar.  But what are you going  to do?  Just not report it?  I mean, it's kind of a  catch-22.  Not report it in a  certain way.  Like, there's a certain  way to report it.  They should report him  as just the lonely 
[00:11:00]  nothing that he is.  They always tend to  report these guys like  they're villains in a  film because it makes  it more captivating  television.  When Cho massacred  those people,  they showed his  manifesto.  You know, they just  make him more  important than he  really was.  Yeah, make him  bigger than he was.  Cho was just an ass.  He was a bum and he  couldn't write and he  sucked and he was a  nobody.  And that's what he  should have been  reported as.  But man, did the  media glorify that  kid.  Yeah.  Well, and now, of  course, following 
[00:11:30]  Jimmy's lead, the  fear-mongering because  of the mall shooting  has begun.  Take a good look at  the two guys walking  through the aisles of  this convenience store.  No, they're not  wearing flesh-colored  pants.  They're buck naked.  Now, one of them  had their shoes.  Oh, wow.  We got our stories  mixed up.  I don't think that's  the story.  We got our stories  mixed up.  That would be kind of  funny.  All right, we'll have  to play that in a  second.  But, uh, okay.  Sorry about that.  Actually, I will take  the blame for that  one.  Ooh.  It's a little early  still. 
[00:12:00]  Damn.  All right, here we go.  The fear-mongering  has begun.  The fear sparked by  that deadly mall  shooting in Nebraska  is being felt at  local shopping centers  in our area.  On Long Island,  security...  Why?  The local angle.  They love taking  these stories and  spinning them so they  could scare everybody  individually in their  own cities.  These dead bodies  aren't even cold yet  and your local news  has to jump right on  it and start the  fear-mongering.  Could it happen here?  Yes, it could. 
[00:12:30]  Could a loser go to  your mall?  The fear sparked by  that deadly mall  shooting in Nebraska  is being felt at  local shopping centers  in our area.  On Long Island,  security teams could  be seen patrolling  the grounds at  Roosevelt Field Mall  in Garden City.  Simon Property Group,  which owns 16 malls  in the tri-state area,  including Roosevelt Field,  says it works closely  with local police  departments to  develop security  measures.  Many shoppers say  they appreciate  the added security.  Good.  Yeah, I was been 
[00:13:00]  walking around  out there walkie-talkies  and everything.  It seems like  they communicate  with each other.  Any kind of  extra security added  is always great.  Sure.  Simon Property Group  says it also keeps  its security tactics  confidential to stay  one step ahead  of the criminals.  Have you ever heard  a bigger non-story  than that?  No.  No.  That was the worst  case of just words  coming out  and filling space.  There was nothing.  I want one of those  security guys to go,  look, let's be honest,  we're all laughed.  There's no metal  detectors at the 
[00:13:30]  entrances and we can  only patrol so much.  There are so many  people in here,  we have no idea  if they're even  carrying.  Yeah, the guy  apparently got in  and up to the third  floor with a rifle.  Yeah.  How does that happen?  You just stroll in  with a rifle and no one  touches you until you  start firing?  Well, did he have it  concealed in any kind  of a case?  He might have.  I mean, a weapons case.  I mean, like a guitar  case or something like that.  I want to be in a guitar  case.  I don't know.  1930s, pulled out a  Tommy gun from a guitar 
[00:14:00]  case.  And the local shop,  I like how they talk  to the shoppers, get  them to say something  and then just lead in  with something that  they already know the  shoppers have said.  Yeah.  Like the shoppers could  have both said, well,  we don't know how we  feel about Tuesdays.  Local shoppers had  opinions on Tuesdays.  Just the words.  I want to be a news  director.  My story would be a  little different.  I love Jimmy through  that.  Just going, yeah, of  course, of course.  It was the perfect 
[00:14:30]  story, right, Jimmy?  It was perfect.  You got a mall  shooting.  You make it local.  You talk to the  security people to make  everyone kind of feel  safe.  Yeah.  That they got measures  in place.  It was perfect.  Perfect for everybody.  Well, their measures  are confidential.  What they do, because,  you know, I would think  they just kind of walked  around and see what's  going on.  And if there's a  problem, they call  someone.  But apparently they  have bigger measures  that are confidential.  Confidential.  They don't want to tip  their hand to anybody.  I hate to talk to the  people that are actually  doing this gig, but 
[00:15:00]  mall security.  You know, the big boys  are doing real security  work.  You enjoy your mall  security job.  Mall security is pretty  much, I can't find a  directory.  Can you tell me where  the shoe store is?  Hey, slob, who used to  torture animals when he  was small, point out the  KB toys immediately.  Hey, we did a quick  Google and I-Rock found  a classic mall security 
[00:15:30]  guy.  He's got to be 80.  He looks like Fred  Mertz.  Yeah.  Hey, Rick, I got a job  at the mall.  There you go.  There's your mall security.  It's usually guys, you  know, that retired, retired  cops and stuff, but not  even retired cops, like  guys off the job for a  few years.  We're talking guys off  the job for decades.  Dude, I saw at the  Roosevelt Field Mall, this  woman, she was an 
[00:16:00]  African-American woman,  and she, I could not  describe or look away  from her body type.  It was just this, like,  mass, like, she was  like Jupiter.  It was a just massive  body, all compressed.  Her butt had the big  shelf going, but it was  giant, giant, and she  was in the little, you  know, ranger outfit.  For some reason, mall 
[00:16:30]  security has to dress  like park rangers.  I don't know what it is.  They're looking for  picnic baskets that  have been stolen by  bears, but they have to  dress with those stupid  little ranger hats and  everything.  So she's going around  and just the most  obnoxious woman I've  ever seen.  She, like, gives people  crap for nothing that if  a group of maybe three  or four people are  hanging out by the  bottom of the  escalator, she gets up  and, hey, hey, move 
[00:17:00]  it, move it along,  move, move.  She doesn't want anyone  standing anywhere, and  she stands with her  thumbs in her belt  like she's the sheriff.  The sheriff isn't.  But it's just, and I  look at her going, what  the hell could she  possibly do if anyone  wants to do any type of  crime?  You could grab  something, run out  backwards as you taunt  her with a backwards run  and just go, ha, ha, 
[00:17:30]  ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  She couldn't get you.  The Rambo guys are  doing Rambo stuff, you  know, so we're stuck with  like the lady you just  described, who couldn't  stop nothing if it was  really going down.  Awful.  But she'll beat the hell  out of some, you know,  soccer mom just trying to  get a few hours of  shopping in.  Yeah.  She'll overpower them  and make their lives  miserable as they're  trying to shop.  Well, I'd like to hear  the local shopper angle  on how they look.  Oh, yeah, let's get  some local.  They ask questions  they have to answer a  certain way.  How do you feel about  mall security?  I think it's good, you 
[00:18:00]  know, if, and they  just cut them off.  So have you heard  about the shooting, and  does that affect the  way you'll shop this?  Um, yeah, I think I'll  be a little more, um,  aware of my surroundings,  and, you know, I have  children, so I am  concerned.  Concern seems to be on  the face of many  shoppers after the,  shut up, it isn't,  you're lying.  Stupid news.  That's exactly what it is.  I hate it.  I know, that's what they're  stupid news. 
[00:18:30]  They just make up stuff.  I was reading, I was  reading a great article  on, um, local news.  Actually, it was Lee  Abrams, one of his  blogs.  He works for XM.  He writes a great blog  on, on media and stuff  and junk culture, but he  sucks on the radio and  even, uh, discusses that  in his latest blog.  Really?  How we say he sucks on  the air, and he's like,  well, that's still to be  determined.  Like, no, you really do  suck.  But he's a good writer.  Is he?  Yeah.  Because I cannot hit that  delete button fast enough.  When you see those  blogs come in?  Oh, oh, it's just, on my 
[00:19:00]  iPhone, it's a quick swipe  push.  You don't read it?  No, why would I?  Good point.  But he talks about how  local news hasn't changed  in, uh, 20, 30 some odd  years.  What do you mean?  And that the internet now  does a better job giving  you the news than your,  your local TV station.  Local news has changed.  A lot.  That's why it sucks.  How has it changed,  really?  Because it used to be,  you, you.  I'm not talking about,  like, Walter Cronkite.  No, no.  Your local news. 
[00:19:30]  Back in the day, local  news was Walter, and I  know he was national, but  that's all you got.  Let me tell you something,  though.  Your local news, you used  to actually get, uh, news  from your little area.  It was a little more, if  you went network, you'd get,  you'd get the whole  country, uh, some foreign  news, you know, overseas  news.  And then, uh, your local  news would actually tell  you what was going on.  And they were kind of  some important stories,  things you might want to  know about, uh, uh, laws  being passed in the city 
[00:20:00]  and crime, things like  that.  Now it's, it's news  entertainment.  It wasn't that back when  they had, you know,  action news.  Dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan,  dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan,  dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan,  dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan.  And who was the guy that  would come on there?  Was it Bill Butel?  It could be Bill Butel.  Jim Jensen.  Man's men.  They'd come on and give you,  like, the local news without  any, all the flash or glitz,  because they didn't need it.  And the cleavage.  Because the, the, you've got 
[00:20:30]  to have cleavage.  Yeah, the cleavage.  It didn't matter if they  got ratings or not.  It was kind of the local  station's responsibility to  just throw news on, because,  you know, that's kind of what  they said they had to do.  So they didn't care about  ratings or glitzing it up.  But then it came to the  point where they realized  they could make some money  through sponsorship, so they  competed with each other.  Really, because you think  about it, the local network  affiliates never really  competed with each other  in the news.  They didn't care which one 
[00:21:00]  you watched.  But then it got to the  point where they actually  started, hey, we got to,  we got to spice this up.  And I think it really  started with the Good Day  New York type format,  where they'd have that  morning kind of wackiness  going on.  Kind of like a, like a  morning zoo radio show  for TV.  Yeah, yeah.  And they realized that  that was kind of working.  Like it was bringing  idiots in to watch it.  When you'd send some guy,  who was that English guy  that used to just go around  knocking on doors? 
[00:21:30]  Gordon Elliott.  Gordon Elliott here.  I'm going to cook breakfast  with this family.  Who cares?  Who the hell cares?  But that kind of started  the we're sending people  out to do wacky things.  Well, every, like,  newscast now has to have  wacky guy that has to go  out and do that wacky thing.  Stunt guy.  Stunt.  It used to be exclusively  the dopey radio.  It's stunt boy.  Stunt boy.  Local news now has a  stunt boy.  Like he's the guy that  we'll go.  Spuds Buckley.  Hey! 
[00:22:00]  Linger, linger.  Yee, yee, yee, yee.  But, yeah, he's the guy  that jumps in the, you know,  in the ocean when it's  like January.  Yeah, I'm going to be  swimming with the polar bears.  This is going to be great.  And then the dopey floozy  behind the desk is like,  oh, that's outrageous.  You know, be careful.  Oh, you couldn't get me  in that water this time.  No, no, no.  No, no.  And speaking of cold.  Shuffle, shuffle.  Well, you know, it's a...  Shuffle the papers.  Shuffle the papers  even though they don't  read them anymore.  So, all right, well. 
[00:22:30]  It's got to be some  shrinkage going on there.  What?  Are we on?  Oh, boy.  Well, I don't know.  Shuffle, shuffle the papers.  Straightening them out.  Nervous little hand motions.  That's all it is.  A little nervous Nellie's  in front of the camera  when it comes to improv.  They don't improv  when they're doing the story.  You never see them  reading off the prompter.  Unfortunately, eight people  were shuffle, shuffle, shuffle,  shuffle, shuffle.  No, they sit there  and look all like  they have knowledge  on the subject.  They're just reading it.  Watch, when they go off book  and they try to have personalities, 
[00:23:00]  that's when they have to  get the papers  and just shuffle them.  Because the idea  of just staring and bombing  is just too much for them.  D-Rock, give me one of those, man.  Where's the one where  the anchor,  the teleprompt  or prompter  or whatever  breaks and the guy's like,  he did good.  Oh, he lost his mind.  A bad thing happened  or he did a good thing.  He did good  over there  with that thing.  Bad thing,  good happen thing.  Can you find it real fast?  You know which one  I'm talking about?  The best dude  is that guy laughing  through that 
[00:23:30]  driving death story.  Oh, God,  he was laughing his ass off.  Oh, yeah.  Can you get that one too?  People died.  He's making faces or something.  All right,  we're finding  a couple good ones.  Let's say hi  to Martina in Jersey.  Martina, what's up?  You know how you're  talking about  the security of the mall?  Yeah.  Well, the mall  by where I live at,  the security guards  have their own Segways,  so they kind of  chase you around  if you do something wrong.  And then when they all meet,  you have to see it.  It's hilarious, man.  See them all running  after one person  in the Segways. 
[00:24:00]  On those little Segways.  Yeah, those Segways  really need to be destroyed.  What's a Segway?  That's that big  two-wheeled little thing.  That goofy thing  with the big handles.  Yeah, that's probably  the best car  to ever get to drive  in their life.  You can't even look.  You look like  such a dork.  You could be like  the manliest man  on a Segway  and you'd just  look ridiculous.  Wait, stop it.  Put your little helmet on.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[00:24:30]  Thank you, Martina.  Here's a news guy  losing the script.  Here's a great one.  A local man  spots something suspicious  and that he decides  to spring into action.  He has done something  that is very good.  Port St. Lucie police  need to know  if you have seen anything  of the man  who exposed himself  to several women  and children.  They released this  composite sketch.  See how he lost it?  And he did something 
[00:25:00]  well, he did something  good.  And we're heading  toward a break,  but really fast.  Let's squeeze this one  into this.  This is the one  we referred to  a little while ago.  Police in Portugal  now have a description  of a  let me find  that script here.  I apologize.  Here we are.  Police in Portugal  now have a description  of a man they believe  may be involved 
[00:25:30]  in the case of a mystery.  He just had nothing.  Let me find that script.  I have nothing.  You got to get the guy  laughing after the...  That's the greatest one ever.  Do you have that real fast,  Iraq,  or after the break?  Oh, Iraq, okay.  After the break,  we'll try that.  Wow, phone's lit.  They're talking about  mall security.  They're talking about  the shooting in the mall.  They're talking about  that tanker truck explosion  in Boston.  We're off to a good start today.  We got other things.  What?  He hasn't.  You haven't?  Oh, good. 
[00:26:00]  All right, let's do it real fast.  A fire crash leaves  three people dead.  Police in Nebraska say  a rental truck  carrying two people  lost control  across the median  and collided head-on  with a semi-truck.  Both trucks burst into flames  and witnesses say  there were several  explosions.  Excuse me.  The two people  in the real...  The two people  in the rental truck  and the driver  of the semi...  This is a sad story.  Excuse me.  We're killed.  Crews say they had  fires contained  in about ten minutes. 
[00:26:30]  If you're trying  to make someone laugh  at an inappropriate time,  that is the granddaddy...  That's the granddaddy  of victory.  You can't pick a worse time  to make a news guy laugh  reporting a fiery head  on college.  That guy will never  leave that small town  he's in.  It's just...  That guy's career  is effed.  Did they fire the other  guy for doing it?  Oh, no.  I think they did.  There's a follow-up.  There's a guy making him laugh.  Wait, I don't know  the backstory.  Oh, yeah.  The reason he laughed  is there was someone  behind the cameraman...  Just messing around with him?  Oh, what an ass. 
[00:27:00]  Was he using a banana  like a phone?  That's funny.  It wasn't complete hilarity,  but I mean...  Did he have his sunglasses  on upside down  and he was swimwalking?  I do that.  I know you do.  It makes me laugh.  I got a banana right now  and if people are doing something,  I'll just go,  watch this.  Hello?  Say it's a phone.  But I'm talking to a banana.  It's hysterical, Jimmy.  Here's another laughing clip.  Why not?  Go ahead.  We're starting the skinny  with a serious story  and we were laughing.  We'll explain why  in a minute. 
[00:27:30]  First of all,  this is tragic news here.  Owen Wilson,  a lot of...  There we go already.  Anyway,  poor Owen,  says the graphic.  He apparently tried  to kill himself,  which is terribly serious,  which is why you should  not be laughing right now,  Taina.  He overdosed  or tried to  on pills  and slit his wrist.  This is according  to the New York Post,  which as you can see,  they were nice enough  to put this on their  front page here.  He's still in the hospital. 
[00:28:00]  There he is.  But anyway,  he's in the hospital  in Los Angeles  asking for his privacy.  Terribly sad situation.  Yeah.  Apparently,  he suffers from depression.  Some of this is funny  when they're laughing.  This story...  I'm just going to move along here.  You're not going to tell him  why you're laughing?  Oh, it's so immature.  I think not.  All right.  That's pretty good.  Would it be funny?  If you said,  no,  because the story,  I think it's funny.  Yeah, it's the story.  You idiot.  Risk cutting always gets me  to giggle.  We've talked about this.  All right.  We're running late.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:28:30]  Stay there.  Let's get right back into this.  Another busy day  on the Opie and Anthony show.  Phones are lit.  That's what we want  from you guys.  Lots and lots of phone calls.  877-212-ONA.  Write that down.  You're going to need it  eventually.  Where do you want to go, man?  We got lots of choices here.  Let's start with Ed  in Long Island.  Ed, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Yeah, I just wanted to say  I feel much safer  than the fat, stupid 
[00:29:00]  little park rangers  they have over at the mall there  have walkie-talkies,  not guns.  They can all call each other  and say,  hey, look,  everybody's getting shot.  Maybe we can hide behind  Fatty like a human shield.  Yeah, we're not too impressed  with the mall security guys.  No.  We got a whole bunch of pictures  up on our computer here  of mall security guys  from all over the country.  Not too impressed.  Yeah, no,  there's nothing to be impressed about.  I was telling Anthony,  thanks a lot to Simon people 
[00:29:30]  for the walkie-talkies.  Yeah.  I'd like to give them guns.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  What bothers me about this mall shooting  is I think this kid  started the mall shooting bit.  The bit?  Well,  lack of a better way to say it,  but I think the kid  might have started  the mall shooting bit  and that's kind of scary.  Get some copycats.  Because every kid  that goes to school  is aware of Columbine.  Every single one.  And then when they  catch these kids  that are planning school shootings,  they all mention Columbine. 
[00:30:00]  Yep.  And that's what's scary  about this whole thing  that went down yesterday.  Well, this was one of those kids  that just  felt he was an outcast.  And we had said it before,  he lost his job,  lost his girlfriend,  his parents threw him  out of the house.  So he...  He lost his lucrative job,  at McDonald's, yes.  Yes.  His McDonald's job.  His McDonald's job.  And he decided,  he wrote in his note  he wanted to go out  and style  and be famous.  So he goes to a mall  and opens fire. 
[00:30:30]  I don't know what kind of  rifle he was using.  The hell is that?  I don't know.  You know,  you just mentioned something  that reminded me.  I was in the can reading,  getting ready for the show.  And you said how the guy  wanted to go out  and be famous or whatever.  There's a case here  in New York  or a story,  I should say.  I don't...  I got to find it  really fast.  A lady,  she was,  I think,  76.  I guess I could do it  without reading the story.  76.  She decided  she did not want  to die alone 
[00:31:00]  in her apartment.  So on the east side  of Manhattan,  she went to a little park  and she stabbed herself  on a park bench  in a park  and it had a suicide note  that basically said  what I just said,  that she did not want  to die alone.  So this is how  she decided  to end her life.  She pretty much  died alone  on the bench,  didn't she?  Yeah, I guess.  Kind of creepy, right?  It is creepy.  Trying to find a story.  Whatever. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, here it is.  An elderly woman  killed herself  on a Manhattan park bench  and left a suicide note  saying she didn't want  her death  to go unnoticed.  The unidentified woman  was found  in this park.  She had stabbed  herself in the stomach.  In her note,  she said she did not  want to die alone  in her apartment.  In her stomach.  How weird is that?  If you take  the death tour  in L.A.,  they don't do it anymore  because the local residents  really, really  did not like the fact 
[00:32:00]  that a hearse was  driving around L.A.  showing where all  these famous people died.  It was one of the  greatest things  I've ever done  as a tourist.  You jump in the hearse.  What was it called?  The Graveline Tour?  And all of a sudden  you're going down  Hollywood Boulevard.  They're at a red light.  I've told this story  a few times.  And they point to the sidewalk  and they're like,  see that sidewalk  over there  outside that theater?  And they're like,  yeah, sidewalk  outside the theater.  Who cares?  Oh, that's where  Fred Mertz dropped dead  of a heart attack  after a movie premiere  or something like that.  My arm's tingling, Rick. 
[00:32:30]  I'm like, wow.  But then,  I'm not sure,  I think it was  the Good Witch  from The Wizard of Oz  that we drove by  her joint  or the hotel  she was staying at  late in her life.  And they explain  how she killed herself.  Yeah, real creepy.  And it reminds me  of the story  I just read.  Yeah.  She was a very old woman.  She was a very old woman.  She knew she didn't have  much time left  and she didn't want  to live anymore.  So she put on  her favorite dress,  like a gown dress. 
[00:33:00]  She put on makeup,  made herself look  all pretty, right?  And then she proceeded  to take a plastic bag,  tie it around her head  and tighten the,  whatever she used  to tighten it  and suffocated herself  with her nice makeup  and her nice dress on.  Imagine the poor bastard  that found that.  How do you walk in there  and see that blue face?  I don't know.  Just with the plastic  sucked in.  Yeah.  Probably making the,  oh yeah. 
[00:33:30]  Like that last gasping breath.  Because you might want  to try to kill yourself  while you do  or whatever,  but your body's  going to do everything  to try to survive.  So that's exactly  what would happen.  You're not going to sit there  like just calm  and not try to breathe.  Like people who hang  themselves but don't jump,  they just kind of like  their feet are actually  touching the floor  and they're dangling.  Yeah, they want to choke.  How do you not just stand up?  Right.  When it gets too hot  in the kitchen,  how do you not stand up?  Let's go to Kiana  in Boston listening on BCN.  Lots of BCN calls today.  This is good.  Kiana, what's up?  Hey, what's going on? 
[00:34:00]  I just wanted to call  and talk about that fire  in Everett.  Yeah.  It actually was because  the guy was going  too fast around the rotary.  But I guess like  the fire just stopped short  of like an old people home.  So they showed the cops  pulling out the old people  out of the house  and they were like,  oh, I thought it was firecrackers.  And I thought, you know,  my wife's new car,  it's my wife's new car.  Oh, you don't have a wife, sir.  She died 10 years ago.  Oh, you haven't had a new car 
[00:34:30]  since it was called  a horse and buggy.  I thought we were going out  to play kick the can  so I could be young again.  Poor old folk.  All right, Kiana, thank you.  All right, thanks.  All right, let's say hi  to Scott in Iowa.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, I'm not too far  from where Omaha  where that thing happened.  Is Iowa near Omaha?  I need a map today.  Omaha, Nebraska.  Nebraska, Iowa. 
[00:35:00]  Okay, all right,  you're close, sure.  Okay, so anyway,  they had the news,  they're showing this lady  they got out of there  after the big drama happened  and she was in tears,  you know, crying.  And the first thing  the reporter says,  do you think this will affect  your shopping now?  And she's bawling  her eyes out.  Of course it won't.  Yeah, they love  getting in the face  of people that are  in the tragedy.  Oh, and they said  that the guy shot  a teddy bear in the store.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he just slipped out,  shot this stuffed teddy bear 
[00:35:30]  and it just flew  all over the place.  Yeah, that's a lot more  tragic than shooting  a human being.  Yeah, the people.  Point blank in their face.  Poor Teddy Ruxpin, no.  All right, Scott, thank you.  A Teddy Ruxpin joke.  Let's go to New York City.  Jay, what's up?  I'll use the term joke.  Hey, good up, fellas.  How you doing this morning?  Good, Jay.  Beautiful.  Oh, what a beautiful  morning it is.  You guys heard about  the guy running naked  across the Brooklyn Bridge  singing,  Oh, what a beautiful  morning.  Fucking hip-hop. 
[00:36:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I mean, I mean, I mean.  Hold on, hold on.  We've got to start over  because you're cursed.  That was a laugh curse.  I love laugh curses.  They're my favorite.  So wait,  Brooklyn Bridge,  guy's naked  running across the bridge  singing,  Oh, what a beautiful morning.  Oh, what a beautiful  morning, baby.  And he was run over  and just splattered  all over the place.  And real quick,  I got to say  what up to Jimmy, dude.  Hey, Jimmy,  I sent you a pint of my blood,  Jimmy.  I love you, man.  Thank you. 
[00:36:30]  A pint of his blood.  That was very nice.  Yeah, Jimmy,  did you get my cup of blood?  Thank you, I did.  What are you trying  to do, sir?  Yeah.  Come on,  Blades of Glory, Jimmy.  I only saw that once.  I didn't like it.  I hate it.  People do these references  that, oh, for God.  It's not exactly  Apocalypse.  Now you're referencing it.  My girlfriend made me watch  that because she's friends  with, uh,  All right, all right.  He's not stopping either.  He won't stop.  You're going to do it all day.  I hated Blades of Glory.  My girlfriend, uh.  There were some,  a couple good scenes,  but.  Were there?  Eh. 
[00:37:00]  Apparently they were  left on the editing list.  Oof.  My girlfriend watched it  because she's friends  with Amy Poehler.  She's like,  no, it'll be good.  Oh, she is.  Yeah.  And, uh,  I didn't care for it.  At all.  No.  Not one chuckle, huh?  No, we're the girlfriend  at that time.  For making me watch it.  We didn't watch the one.  I thought it was  your current girlfriend.  Yeah, it is.  You said girlfriend  at the time.  I didn't care for her  at the moment  I was watching the movie,  I mean.  Oh, oh, oh.  Or last night, actually.  We were fighting,  and she's like,  I'm sorry.  Oh, no.  Why were you fighting last night? 
[00:37:30]  Who knows?  Because women  are emotional psychopaths.  My hormones.  Oh, was that it?  I can't express to you  how nuts they are.  It's impossible to deal with.  Is it that time of, uh...  Yeah, and she told me...  They get a little, you know...  They get a little, uh...  Eh.  Eh.  And I just don't defuse it.  No, you feed into it,  don't you?  Do I?  Do I?  I sense a little fire  in the room, 
[00:38:00]  so I douse myself  in gas,  and I open the door quickly  to allow as much air in  as possible.  You know what?  I'm kind of...  I'm kind of the same way.  Really?  Well, maybe not with the...  Necessarily with the, uh...  The fiancée.  But, uh...  Yeah, when I...  When there's...  I don't avoid that stuff.  Maybe I should start  avoiding that stuff.  I'm like Jimmy.  I just, like...  I run toward a fire  covered in gasoline, too.  I'm the worst.  We were just fighting  last night on the phone.  She's like,  Look, I'm cranky.  I'm emotional. 
[00:38:30]  I just want to...  Let's just not talk.  I'm not...  Wow, that's...  Alright, that's a little, um...  Like, hurtful and rejection...  Rejection-y.  Wait, she said that to you?  Yes.  I really have a way  with the words, don't I?  Yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Rejection-y.  I would be...  I would be...  I would be cool with that, actually.  Yeah, well, I understood the fact  that she was being like...  She didn't want to...  She didn't want to get into  a big argument.  She's like,  Look, let's just talk tomorrow.  I'm not thinking rationally.  I'm just cranky. 
[00:39:00]  But, uh...  By then, I was already irritated.  I went to barrel in there.  Full...  Full...  Guns blazing.  Oh.  Alright.  It wasn't that bad.  And did it...  Did it escalate?  No, it just...  It was yelling,  but it was like...  I believe we've had much worse.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to, uh...  Jeff Wood in Omaha.  Jeff Wood.  Hey, Opie.  Waddle-doodle.  Waddle-doodle.  Um...  I live about a mile  from the West Roads Mall  they're talking about,  and, uh...  They, uh...  Doing all the somber music  and everything.  And if you look, 
[00:39:30]  uh...  I'm right underneath  the E-Rox cam.  I got the news on.  And, uh...  What they're doing is  they got all that somber music  and everything,  and then right after that  they go to, uh...  Time-saver traffic and weather.  I guess in all fairness,  I don't know if there's  an easy way to seg into  the next story  after a mall shooting,  but still.  Still.  Yeah, it's kind of rough.  It's not.  Yeah.  It's really embarrassing.  It's embarrassing  that this is what  put Omaha on the map. 
[00:40:00]  You know?  Well, I don't even know  what Omaha is good for.  I really don't.  Uh...  Mutual of Omaha Insurance.  You're talking to probably  a million people right now,  Jeff Wood.  Uh...  Why don't you do Omaha proud  and tell us what...  Why we should allow you  to be part of the  United States still.  Uh...  Can somebody hit  the crickets button?  All right.  Thank you, Jeff Wood.  All right.  Hey, uh...  Speaking of nude...  Nude?  We kind of played  the first couple seconds  of this by accident. 
[00:40:30]  Mm-hmm.  Speaking of local news,  this is a story  they're all over  today.  Take a good look  at the two guys  walking through the aisles  of this convenience store.  No, they're not wearing  flesh-colored pants.  They're buck naked.  Now, one of them  had their shoes on,  so...  The other one  was naked completely.  Store manager  Samantha Cooley says  the men strolled in  around 3 a.m.  Sunday morning.  After picking up  some candy  and a drink,  they walk right up  to the counter  for their full frontal  close-up,  just strolling around 
[00:41:00]  like...  Like they had  their clothes on.  The woman working  the graveyard shift  doesn't seem to mind.  Lucky for these  mystery men,  the store was empty  and there were no kids  within eyeshot.  Thank God.  Exposing yourself  to a minor in public  is actually a class  six felony.  Tell me about it.  For now,  the store manager  is thinking about  investing in a new sign.  No shirt,  no shoes,  no pants...  No dyes.  The clerk did not  call Phoenix police.  The phantom streakers  paid for everything  they picked up  at the store. 
[00:41:30]  They're just trying  to make their  YouTube video.  It's so obvious.  Yeah,  everyone's trying  to do that now.  Trying to make  their video.  Get the big YouTube  video to put up.  That's all that is.  Did you see the video  or the picture  in the paper  of this group  of black girls  on the subway  assaulted this guy?  He's either white  or Hispanic  and they were taunting him  and they were yelling  things like,  you think you're  a slick white boy?  One girl screamed  at the man  and they wound up  attacking the guy.  Yeah.  It's on page 17  in the New York Post.  That's not a big story 
[00:42:00]  though.  And no mention  of any type  of hate crime  or anything like that.  Nope.  It's just,  and they're even saying,  is it real or not?  We don't know.  It's up there.  But if it was  the other way around,  it wouldn't matter  if it was real or not.  Just the way they act.  Yeah,  that's pretty much  what they like,  how they like portraying it.  Well,  as soon as we all realize  that there are white rules  and black rules,  we'll all get along  much better.  As soon as white people  do it.  As soon as we realize 
[00:42:30]  that that's what's going on.  There's white rules  and black rules.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Okay, good.  What?  The Daily News did it right.  Page 7, of course.  It's not,  they think it might be  a hoax for some reason.  I guess there's something  in here that doesn't look right.  But at least the,  uh...  Well,  the person that filmed it  is an aspiring filmmaker.  Right.  Some girl.  Oh,  so this might have been  a setup.  Might have been a setup,  but it might have just been  let's go out  and really do this  and get the real moment  kind of thing also. 
[00:43:00]  But it says,  uh,  web video shows  group of black teens  attacking White Rider,  but is it a hoax?  Okay,  that's fine.  Wow,  the post doesn't have  that angle though?  That it might be a hoax?  Uh,  no,  they do,  but they wouldn't,  they don't,  they mention the race  incidentally in the middle  of the article.  Gotcha.  All right,  really fast,  this is a quick little  story they did  on the local news  here in New York  that made us laugh  really hard.  This is how stupid  the news is today.  Falling asleep  at the wheel?  Well,  drink a cup of coffee.  French researchers say  that. 
[00:43:30]  French,  French researchers say.  Wait,  wait.  Don't,  don't,  don't ruin my vibe here  because I,  before I go to bed,  I always have  a nice cup of coffee  because that's what I  use to make myself tired.  Yeah.  What are they saying?  Works every time.  What are they saying?  What are these French  researchers saying?  Are they saying that  a drug called  caffeine  keeps you awake?  and,  and listen to what they say  that it's better then.  Falling asleep at the wheel? 
[00:44:00]  Well,  drink a cup of coffee.  French researchers say  they tested sleep deprived  drivers and those  who drank coffee  drove better than  drivers who took  a quick 30 minute nap  or those who did  nothing at all.  Of course,  researchers say  the best choice  for a drowsy driver  is to get off  the road entirely.  Do me a favor.  I don't,  I'm not going to get angry  if that story  was from 1961.  What are they,  what are they doing?  What were they going  for there? 
[00:44:30]  I don't know.  And then they said  the best way,  realize how,  how moronic  the,  the ending of that is.  the best way  to keep from  falling asleep  while you're driving  is to pull off  the road  and go to sleep,  which means  you're no longer  driving.  So it becomes  irrelevant to the story.  You are now  just a person sleeping.  And I also pointed out  to Anthony  as we were discussing  this in the office,  they're saying  a cup of coffee  better than sleeping  for a half hour. 
[00:45:00]  And I'm,  I told the head,  I'm like,  what if you pulled  an all nighter  and you're just  dead tired?  And you're like,  well,  I remember the news  said a cup of coffee  so you drink  your cup of coffee  but you're way  tired for a cup of coffee.  Now you're  tolling down the highway  at 70 miles an hour  just snoring away.  Snoring.  You're just asleep  with the coffee  drooling out  the side of your mouth  because you're just  following what the news  told you.  The news told me  I was going to nap  but screw it.  But you are no longer  a driver once you  pull off.  Once you pull off.  Right, right.  The best way.  The best way. 
[00:45:30]  Well, of course  because you're not  driving anymore.  French researchers  say that if you're  tired,  fly first class  to Spain.  What?  That doesn't help.  And you know,  there's a big mall  shooting and they  decided that they  needed to...  That was big.  They needed 30 seconds  to do that story today.  Of course.  When was that from  and where?  Today, local news.  That's all I can tell you.  But they're all  the same news to me.  Except for Jill  because she looks hot  and she shows cleavage.  But besides that,  they're all the same crap. 
[00:46:00]  Could we please  call them?  I'm not kidding.  We'd like to talk  about this story.  This story is very  interesting.  Maybe about the  cup of coffee thing.  We think that's  riveting.  We could get  Richard Huff on.  He's always good.  We love Richard Huff.  Richard Huff.  He's got a great  little angle on this  whole news thing.  And TV in general.  All right.  Hey, Bill Burr  is joining the program  next.  He is.  Yes, he is.  And we got lots  of stuff still to do  here, man.  News reports on 
[00:46:30]  water-powered car.  Well, problem solved.  A lot of water out there.  This is from  No More Gasoline.  This is from 1998.  Bill will love this.  Bill loves this whole  powered car thing.  Yeah, he's got some  ideas as far as that goes.  So we'll get into that.  We got Alan talking  to what?  President Bush  yesterday.  Through his daughter.  Jenna Bush, yeah.  I guess we got the  audio of that.  If she didn't talk  to the president, 
[00:47:00]  she would have talked  to it as soon as  the show was over.  I have my banana.  Wait, we got breaking  news from Chris in Jersey.  Yes, breaking news,  Chris.  Breaking news.  You actually move  your lungs back and  forth.  You actually have  oxygen, so if you're  choking, breathe.  Thank you, sir.  That's breaking news  from Chris in New Jersey.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I jumped the gun there.  You're checking out  the Opie and Anthony  show.  Bill Burr in studio  playing Carolines in New  York City, right? 
[00:47:30]  All weekend long, Bill.  That's right.  Thursday through Sunday.  Very, very cool.  A whole weekend of  hilarity.  Hilarity will ensue.  High chinks.  Madcap mayhem.  We got David Tell at  8 o'clock?  Yeah, David Tell at  8 o'clock.  Very busy show today.  There's something I  wanted to say real fast,  but I forgot.  I was just going to run  down some of the things  that America is talking  about.  We already mentioned  Kiefer Sutherland.  He's going to be serving  48 days in jail for his 
[00:48:00]  drinking and driving crap.  How come Paris Hilton  gets like a few,  whatever, and Lindsay  Lohan got like an hour,  and then he gets...  Well, because Kiefer is  just completely out of  control.  He's out of control.  The guy is really out of  control.  He loves his drink.  I was going to say, I  thought he already went  through these years, and  then he got the hit 24,  and then they already do  like the People magazine,  an older, more mature  Kiefer Sutherland.  You would assume that he  would have grown up.  Like, all the other  people I guess he hung out 
[00:48:30]  with back in his younger  days.  I guess they stringed up.  Yeah, the Lost Boys years.  That kind of, that whole  thing.  But he just keeps pounding  them down.  I mean, so...  Loves drinking and hopping  in the vehicle.  And he's one of these  guys, 48 days, he'll do  that standing on his head,  no big deal, and then  he'll go back to drinking  and driving.  He's not going to  change, right?  Dude, he does a one-camera  shoot show that's like  16, 18-hour days.  I mean, you've got to  booze after a while.  Maybe that's it. 
[00:49:00]  I don't know, but he's  got to lay off 48 days.  When you're spending 48  days in jail, you really  got to think, maybe this  is a problem.  Maybe I'm in jail for  this.  You do the math, like  Jim was saying, like  the whole Paris, like,  all right, well, Paris,  you know, she's got a  vagina, she can hook  somebody up with a  little favor, so she's  in and out of here in  about 20 minutes, so  carry the one.  I'll be out of here in  11 days.  Yeah.  Also, you get time 
[00:49:30]  served for good  behavior or something  like that, time off for  good behavior.  Even if you're only  serving 48 days, good  behavior.  It's going to be like  12 or 13, whatever.  Also, you got Zeppelin.  They're not sure if  Monday is going to be  the only concert they  do.  That's ridiculous.  I want to get tickets  for that.  For the show on  Monday in London?  I think it's London,  right?  There's probably  tickets available.  I think if you walk  up, they open like  18,000 tickets are  available, that's what  I heard.  I think they're 
[00:50:00]  opening up some  lawn seats.  How many times is  Jimmy Page going to  remaster those same  five songs?  It's like, I already  got suckered the first  two times, and it's  like, and every time  you listen to it, you're  waiting for this whole  new sound, and all he  does is he just adds a  little more audio in  the beginning, now  you can hear Bonham  going, oh, I'm  Nana, too, and then  they just go into the  song.  It's like, dude.  Yeah, the remastering  of the classic CDs and  albums, enough already.  Here's an outtake of  Row, Row, Row Your  Boat.  We decided we didn't  want to put on 
[00:50:30]  physical graffiti.  They figured out  some way to just get  you to pay for the  same stuff over and  over again.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  And I see you're  wearing the Pats hat  there, Bill.  Yes.  Classic.  You know the game on  Monday night, most  watched cable program  ever?  Dude, it's ridiculous.  Ever.  17.5 million people  were checking out the  Pats and the Ravens  game the other night.  It's the most overhyped  thing ever.  What?  The whole Patriots  season.  It's ridiculous.  Why is it overhyped?  Because the Colts went  13-0 two years ago. 
[00:51:00]  Nobody cared.  We were 11-0 the other  night.  They got Don Shula.  I'm like, why is he in  there?  He's in the booth  talking about it.  And like, I don't know.  I think if the Patriots  lose one game, they're  going to win the Super  Bowl.  If they win 16 in a row,  they're going to lose to  the Colts because people  are so amped.  Do you see the Ravens  fans?  They're like a 4-8 team.  They're swinging towels.  They're going crazy.  And it's like a playoff  atmosphere every week.  But the pressure is only  on the Pats.  Yeah.  And the other team has  nothing to lose.  And it's like, if they're  going to go another month 
[00:51:30]  of this, by the time they  get to the playoffs, they're  going to be burned out.  They're just going to be all  burnt out.  We brought this up a few  times.  And what's your answer?  Isn't it more important that  the Pats go undefeated than  winning another Super Bowl?  They got all the Super  Bowls, but now they could  like add this to the list of  accomplishments that they  went undefeated.  Say they go undefeated in the  regular season.  That would definitely be  cool, but I would rather  see them win another  Super Bowl.  Because the Colts, who we  barely beat, and they  didn't have Marvin Harrison,  is like, you know, they're 
[00:52:00]  just sitting out there,  middle of the country.  Nobody's even watching  them.  The whole league is trying  to basically break down the  Patriots' offense every  week, and nobody's looking  at them.  So, yeah, you watch.  And then if the Colts do  win on ESPN, they're going  to act like it's the most  unbelievable thing that  ever happened.  How many have they won  at Super Bowls?  Three.  See, this may, one thing  you got to say, this may  help the Patriots, because  every time, like, it's to  them, the playoffs got to  be boring.  It's like, we're here  again, Brady's the best  quarterback in the league.  I mean, it's like, they're  the best team in football.  So it's like, all right,  where's the challenge? 
[00:52:30]  Every year we do this.  So now there's an added  challenge, like, let's  see, like, going undefeated  thing adds, like, an extra  element to, like, focus on,  as opposed to just being  blase about being in the  playoffs again.  So it actually could work  for them, where instead of  being, like, overconfident or  cocky about, ah, we can't  lose, they have to focus  more because they don't  want to lose.  I just think these last  two weeks, watching how up  the Eagles got and the  Ravens got, I mean, the  Ravens, I mean, there's no  way they're going to make  the playoffs.  It's like the first tackle  of the game, they're just,  you know, pogo stick  jumping up and down. 
[00:53:00]  You tackled them!  Woo!  People just hanging out of  the bleachers.  These games that should be  who give a crap are  becoming, yeah, like you  said, playoff atmosphere.  And literally, they go in  a commercial, it's like  three to nothing, ten  minutes into, Ravens, ten  minutes into the first  quarter and, like,  Kornheiser's going, that's  not a typo, folks!  And it's like, dude,  didn't Brian Billick just  coach a team to a Super  Bowl?  He's been there.  You got Ray Lewis, it's  three to nothing.  Right.  It's not that big a deal.  Everybody, take it down a 
[00:53:30]  few.  Now, does Belichick sit  Brady to rest him up for  the playoffs?  That's what I'm saying,  if we lose a game, that's  what's going to be the  better thing.  Then we can chill and  Belichick...  No, I understand that, but  as they keep winning...  No, they're not going to  pull him if they're  winning.  What does Belichick do?  Because, you know...  You got to go for it.  Undefeated season.  You can't do that to your  players.  I think that he has to do...  Do you sit him the last  game of the season and  they're 15-0 just to rest  him for the playoffs?  Do you sit him when  they're 14-0?  No, because you'll have  a bye week at the 
[00:54:00]  playoffs.  Guaranteed they're going  to have the bye week.  Yeah, but it's more about  them worried if he's going  to get injured.  What do you do as a  coach?  Seriously, this is a  tough situation because  they don't need to win  anymore.  They've won the  division.  Yeah.  They could pretty much  ship Brady off to Hawaii  and go, hey, enjoy the  next month.  We'll come on back in  time for the playoffs.  Yeah, I'm just saying,  if the Patriots lose,  it's not going to be...  And ESPN, because they're  so great at over-hyping  stuff, they're going to  act like the Hindenburg  went down. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God, the  humanity.  They're still going to  make the playoffs.  This is unbelievable.  Who would have a  thought?  Jimmy's Cowboys have a  shot.  Jimmy's a big Cowboys fan.  Yeah, but I don't  think they have a shot  at beating the Patriots.  Someone was talking  about how they think  the Cowboys are going  to beat them in the  Super Bowl, but I don't  see that.  They were the first  team to expose the  weaknesses that we  have on our defense.  And then the Colts, we  saw what they did.  They didn't even have  Marvin Harrison.  So I'm just saying,  it's like, okay, as a  fan, I'm like, dude,  you know, I'm talking 
[00:55:00]  trash.  We're going to kill you  every week.  But obviously, as a  football fan, you're  watching, there's like,  there's no way, you  got the whole league  looking at you, and  they also went on that  Sherman's march in the  beginning of, you know,  just raping teams that,  you know, it gets it  after a while.  They're professionals.  They're like, all right,  you're not going to  score 50 on me.  And you start seeing  the guys, you know,  throwing blocks down  by the knees.  It could backfire,  as all I'm saying.  I'll tell you one  thing, the reason that  the Cowboys kind of  exposed their defense  in a way is because  their offense was on  the field the whole  time, scoring on  Dallas. 
[00:55:30]  I mean, that was a  disgustingly high  scoring game, so it's  not like a point I lost.  No, no, they kept  coming back, but Romo's  in his young Brett  Favre years, where he's  throwing into, like,  triple coverage all the  time, so once he stops  doing that, that guy is  going to be even better.  Well, he had a terrible  playoff last year, which  Aikman, I think, did his  first one, too.  I found that encouraging.  Like, Aikman's first  playoff was a disaster,  I believe.  You got the Jessica  Simpson factor, though,  too.  Yeah, of course.  Small my fingers, guys.  That's what I would be 
[00:56:00]  saying in the huddle.  Okay, we're going to  run a post, too.  Come on, man.  What's it like?  What's it like?  When you're on top  of her, are you  thinking, like, this is  that chick from that  song that I hated?  You ever try to hold  out by just thinking  of her awful movies?  Yeah.  You think he has to  kind of, like, listen  to her music now on  his iPod as he's  getting ready for the  big game?  Oh, yeah, and act  like he always liked  it.  Yeah, right?  Oh, just listen to  her latest crap.  Great stuff.  Dude, that's a great  contest.  Actually, name a  Jessica Simpson song.  I couldn't. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, is this it?  What is this?  What is this?  Is this a Christmas  song?  Celebrate?  Yeah, what the hell  is this?  This is a popular  Jessica Simpson song,  E-Rock.  Oh, my God.  Anyone?  It does sound like  Celebrate.  Yeah.  It sounds like old  Madonna.  E-Rock, is this off  your iPod?  She's doing an early  Madonna rip-off. 
[00:57:00]  No clue.  That's because you're  too busy rubbing one  out when you're watching  the video to actually  remember the song.  I'm just waiting for  the hook.  What's the hook?  This is the hook?  Oh.  Nice.  Ugh.  That's nice.  No, you don't like it.  Shut up.  This is the type of  thing that like soccer 
[00:57:30]  moms with like really  short haircuts will  kind of clap their  hands to at a wedding  and walk around.  I think it's timeless  and it's the kind of  thing Jimmy Page is  going to remaster it  in like seven years.  Hey, the mall  shooting.  I know, Anthony,  another one.  You're friends there  with the assault rifles.  You see what happens  with you people  with your guns?  Guns.  First of all,  I don't know what  this guy was carrying.  They said it was  something, something  assault rifle. 
[00:58:00]  Assault rifle.  First of all,  that's just semantics.  There's no such thing.  How does an assault rifle?  Is there a feel-good  rifle that they have  out there?  An assault rifle,  yeah.  An assault rifle,  they classify as an  assault rifle because  of what it looks like,  not because of  anything else it does.  You can buy a  semi-automatic rifle  that is not an  assault rifle that  fires just as  quickly and just as  accurately as what  they call assault  rifles.  It's things like the 
[00:58:30]  muzzle, the flash  suppressor.  It just looks like  an army gun.  So they call it an  assault rifle.  But it's a  semi-automatic.  You're not rock and  roll in full  automatic.  It's illegal.  You cannot own a  machine gun.  How many do you own  behind that false wall  in your den?  I got a few.  Don't even ask,  Bill.  I got a few.  He's in the middle of  getting his video podcast.  I got it on my  iPhone, but I got to  the file was too big.  I rambled on for 20  minutes. 
[00:59:00]  About guns.  About home.  No, about home  invasions.  Guns in your house,  basically.  No, it was about  home invasions.  Opportunity for you  to show off your  firepower.  How stupid is that?  You know what you're  doing?  You're doing the same  thing that guy from  Beretta did.  What?  Like when he was on  The Tonight Show  like 25 years ago,  man, I could kill  somebody.  Sometimes I feel like  I could kill somebody.  And then he actually  goes out and kills  somebody.  And they use that as  evidence.  Who, Robert Blake?  Yeah.  That's going to be  evidence one day.  No, I never said  that.  What I was saying,  the whole gist of it  is that in my own  home, no one's going 
[00:59:30]  to come breaking in.  I'm not going to be  the guy with the phone  cord around my neck  looking around going,  oh my God, why didn't  I think about, you  know, what I should  have done in this  situation as he's  watching his family  and himself being  ravaged.  You know, and I  mentioned how no  matter how anti-gun  you are, the second  someone's choking you  out and you're  watching your daughter  being raped, you  want a gun.  At that point, I  don't care how  liberal-minded, how  anti-gun you are.  When you're watching 
[01:00:00]  criminals raping your  family and beating  the crap out of  you, the only thing  you want in your  hand right then and  there is a gun to  shoot and kill those  people with.  That's it.  Do you have a  license to carry?  I don't discuss  that.  Because I wanted to  know, like we know  when they're sitting  there talking about  this shooting spree,  it said, terrified  bargain hunters, their  kids cowered inside  store dressing rooms or  ducked behind clothing  racks while others ran  screaming for their  lives.  Now, who do you think 
[01:00:30]  you would be?  Would you be the more,  I'm going to duck  behind a clothing  rack, I'm going to  hide behind this  flannel shirt, or  would you be someone  who is going to  take off?  Or would you have  your little assault  pistol?  I tell you, the  best thing to do is  to quickly identify  where it's coming  from and take an  effing cover.  And just, you're  not going to, what,  are you going to be  a hero?  You can shot.  But running is a...  Running, as a last  resort, if you see 
[01:01:00]  the guy, you know,  pointing the gun at  you, yeah, run.  Serpentine.  But he was apparently  on the third floor of  a three-floor mall that  has the open mall area.  So he had the high  ground there and he  was shooting down on  people.  So it's a tough  situation if you're in  his sights.  I played out that  scenario on Grand  Theft Auto.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, yeah.  I know, you've been in  the mall.  You're going to the  mall and just have a  field day.  It's easy because if  you get knocked out,  you just hit reset 
[01:01:30]  and you're back in.  Just unfortunately in  life, that doesn't  really happen.  You got to, yeah,  you got to hide.  I would be hiding.  You got, yeah, you  got it, you got it.  But hiding guy doesn't  always work, especially  in those office  situations.  The worst stories are  the ones that go,  and I saw the boss  run into his office  and hide under the  desk.  And then the guy  kicks the door open.  You just hear pow,  pow, pow.  I always wonder what  would happen if I  egged the guy on.  Like if I knew I was  about to get shot,  I'm like, come on,  man.  Let's go kill some,  like if I tried to 
[01:02:00]  join him.  Oh, join him at that  final moment?  As self-preservation.  Yeah, come on,  Jimmy.  Just like, I've been  waiting my whole life  for this moment.  Let's go.  You got a gun?  You got one for me?  You're going to step  off and just be like,  I like what you're  doing, man.  Yeah, good boy.  I'm liking the skin,  just somehow.  You got to be like  Hans Groover.  No, God, you're the  one of them.  No, don't shoot me.  And then when he gives  you the gun, you pull  the trigger, but it's  empty.  Like, would he allow  you to do that or  would he just say  shut up and pop you? 
[01:02:30]  He'd shoot you.  You don't know that.  He's probably just  hearing wah, wah in  his head.  Wee, the ring of his  own gunshots.  You know, I hate to  say it, but I'm going  to predict the future  though, because I'm  looking at it right  now on YouTube,  Grand Theft Auto,  Vice City, Mission  No. 9, Mall  Shootout.  Yeah, it's right  there.  They're going to be  showing this on the  news today.  You think?  Violent video games.  Look, I just gave  the local news,  because they all  listened to us.  There's your little  angle today.  Yeah, go enjoy  Grand Theft Auto.  Find the freaking  mall shootout scene. 
[01:03:00]  Don't, because  GTA 4, there's  some new screenshots  up today.  There's your angle.  GTA 4.  Run with it, you  bastard.  Looks amazing.  This game's going  to be great.  Is this the one on  the...  This is Vice City  Mall Shootout.  You just go in the  mall.  There's a new one on  that looks amazing  though.  And Grand Theft Auto,  I think they pretty  much mocked the fact  that mall security  guys don't have much  firepower.  And you can go in  there and just have  a field day.  Walkie-talkie, they  throw it at your  head.  But this never  happens.  You don't have  snipers in the  mall.  No, it's...  It just doesn't 
[01:03:30]  happen.  They do have these  isolated incidents of  these lunatics that  decide to do things.  But, you know, it  shouldn't affect you.  Thank you, Stan.  This is a great  segue, actually.  This week, the  week's fear monger  comes in the shape of  U.S. prosecutor Kim  Worthy, who has just  published her list of  10 games for parents to  boycott over Christmas.  You should not buy  your kid Hitman,  Blood Money.  Why?  That's number 10.  Self-proclaimed most  violent game of a  series.  This game glamorizes  killing.  So you should not buy 
[01:04:00]  that for your child this  Christmas.  No.  God of War.  You should not get that  one for your kids.  Kill your parents.  It's described as a sea  of unrelenting violence.  You shouldn't buy your  kid Resident Evil 4 this  Christmas.  Why?  Parents aren't this  stupid, though.  I think, don't you  think in general, parents  understand what their  kid could handle?  No?  Yeah.  I don't have a kid.  No, I think that they  need to police us and  parent all of us to know  what we can.  Also, on this list, 10 
[01:04:30]  games to avoid this  Christmas, you got  Killer 7.  I haven't heard of  Killer 7.  Have you, Ant?  You're a big gamer.  Killer 7?  No.  No.  It's anime.  Adult game.  It's anime?  Oh, it's anime?  Stop it.  Yeah, it's like seriously  stylized anime.  I'm not going to play  that.  That kind of thing.  I'm not going to play  anime.  What is anime?  Oh, yeah.  All I know about is  anime porno.  They're all just like  little Catholic school  girls.  Yeah.  The Japanese animation.  How did I miss this?  The Japanese animation  usually.  You know, the ones with  the big eyeballs and  stuff and what? 
[01:05:00]  The G-Force.  Yeah.  Experienced adult gamers  call this the most  violent and twisted game  ever played, this Killer  7.  Another game you should  avoid is The  Godfather.  You played The  Godfather, no, Ant?  Yeah, good game.  It is a good game, right?  Liked it.  So basically it's saying  avoid every cool game  out there?  Yeah, that's what it  comes down to.  Games to buy.  Tic-tac-toe.  They're all rated what?  They're all rated M for  mature.  Mature, so kids aren't  supposed to be playing  them.  They do anyway, but I  would suggest you just  get those baby games that  are out for things like  Wii, the Wii. 
[01:05:30]  You know, Stan knows  about the Wii.  Yeah, how about you do a  little bowling?  A little Wii bowling.  Just some bowling or  baseball.  Just safe, safe games,  the Wii.  That's why the Wii is  outsold other gaming  platforms, because parents  know they can buy it for  the kids.  There you go.  All ages, really.  Number five is the  video game.  Kids of all ages.  A video game based, of  course, on the movie  300.  It's called 300.  It invites game room  gladiators to slice their  way through the Persian  army.  Number four on the list  is 50 Cent Bulletproof. 
[01:06:00]  Rapper 50 Cent is  involved in a web of  corruption, double  crosses, and shady  deals that lead him on a  bloody path through New  York's drug underworld.  And what's the game  about?  No, you didn't!  I did!  Number three is  Scarface.  You've played Scarface,  no?  No, I haven't played  that one.  Was it any good?  It's just like it's a  Grand Theft Auto game.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of them, they try  to make Grand Theft Auto.  That's the one Pacino does 
[01:06:30]  the voice, right?  No, they had a sound  alike.  They had a sound alike,  because for some reason  he wasn't in The  Godfather.  They couldn't even use  his image for the  character Michael in  The Godfather.  Everyone else looked  like their character.  But when you played  the game The Godfather,  the Michael character  looked nothing like  Pacino, sounded nothing  like Pacino.  Because they said that  Pacino was going to do  Scarface.  They got his likeness  in Scarface.  Oh, they got his  likeness?  Okay, then that must be  why.  But he didn't do the...  Because he can't  sound like Michael  anymore.  No.  Hey! 
[01:07:00]  I'm going to go out  and hit them all!  Right?  It's not Michael anymore.  That's a creep.  It's not...  But that's just the  awful now Pacino.  Yeah.  A couple more lines.  I'm sorry, Kay.  I'm not going to tell you  about my business!  What?  What happened to his  voice?  He was like a soft-spoken  guy for a while.  He said, no, I think we  could go in there and,  you know, take...  He's a dirty cop.  A cop that is involved  with drugs.  Cop involved with drugs! 
[01:07:30]  The hell is that  what happened to him?  I noticed it first  in Sea of Love,  and I think it's from  all the smoking  and all the scream  takes he's had to do,  like an injustice  for all.  Heft up his voice.  But you watch  The Godfather,  it's a different voice  coming out of that guy.  He damaged his voice  by screaming.  I belong to, no!  No, I think once you get...  Once you establish  yourself as a legend,  by the third legendary film,  no one could be,  hey, Al, can you take  it down a few in the seat? 
[01:08:00]  Ah, yeah.  You just can go...  I think Denzel  is like that right now.  Oh, really?  Whenever Denzel doesn't  know what to do in a scene,  he has some cup of liquid  that he can slap  off the table.  And I've noticed...  Dude, if you watch  American Gangster,  he did it like three times.  He's getting interrogated  and he just...  He just knocks  this coffee off.  And then he has another one.  He dumps a pitcher.  He slaps a glass of wine  out of somebody's hand  and then, like,  dumps the water 
[01:08:30]  over his head.  He just went crazy  in this last one.  That's his new tick.  Oh, that's funny.  All right, so you got  Scarface on this list.  This politician,  she writes,  speaking to the Detroit News  about the extreme content  of some of today's  biggest-selling games  and franchises,  Worthy said,  there's no way  that anyone can convince me  that the horribleness  and gruesomeness  of the crimes  that we've been seeing  is not somehow a result,  at least in part,  of the violent video game culture.  It's not shut up.  Shut the F up.  Just look at the stats. 
[01:09:00]  You know how many people  play violent video games?  Why is it an epidemic  of violent crimes?  Did she forget  that people in this country  were lynching blacks  in the 40s?  Yeah, what video game  was that?  Like, the horrible  behavior people...  But how awful people  have been behaving  for centuries?  It's like,  it's not new.  Yeah, back in the day,  rather than, you know,  playing like PlayStation,  you just looked out  the prairie  and saw the genocide.  As I say,  it eliminated  all the Indians. 
[01:09:30]  Right, right.  Those people seem  to turn out all right.  They were flying kites  and inventing yoga.  Is there a stat out there?  I need to find a stat.  How many people play  what would be deemed  violent video games?  Seriously.  Let's talk about 13%.  I love how Jimmy does that.  He's acting.  He just blurts out  a statistic.  We used to fall for that  and now we just...  I know.  It's like,  oh, 13...  Okay, so 13%.  Wait a minute.  Jimmy's lying.  I'm not acting, though.  If I was acting,  if I was acting,  go ahead,  just say what you said. 
[01:10:00]  You'd like to know percentage?  Yeah, I would like to know...  Well, yeah,  the percentage of people  that play violent video games.  13%.  Ugh!  All right, hey,  let's finish up this list  before we go to break.  Number two on this list  of 10 games to avoid  this Christmas  as far as buying these  for the children  is Manhunt.  Manhunt.  They had to tame down...  What was that?  Manhunt 2.  I guess they had to tame  that one down.  We saw Manhunt, right?  That was the movie they...  That was the game  they brought up. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, Rockstar.  I don't have people's  eyeballs with pliers.  Like, how is that...  Even a...  Why would you buy that  for a kid?  Yeah.  It's definitely...  There are games  that are just made  for adults  and I don't think  these politicians  that are adults  realize that adults  play the games.  They think it's like  this weird...  You're in your basement  if you're an adult  playing a video game.  You're in the basement.  You live at your parents' house.  No one's buying these things.  They can't understand  that people enjoy it.  It's like taking part  in a live-action movie 
[01:11:00]  that you control  some of the action of.  It's not like  you're going to play it  and then just bolt out  your door  and start firing at people.  It also relieves stress  from living this crappy life  that we have to live.  I don't even see it as that.  It's just fun to play  like anything else  that's fun to do.  I relieve stress  by playing video games,  absolutely.  Do you?  Yes.  Yeah, they don't understand  that the kids  who are playing Pac-Man  and Asteroids  are now 40 and 50 years old.  Yeah.  So...  Right.  It's actually a way  for parents to get closer  with their kids.  Exactly.  They go out there  and pretend to kill people. 
[01:11:30]  I remember.  Something I've mentioned  many times.  My nephew,  he's now,  Ben Gainesville there,  he's pre-med,  he's a huge Gators fan,  right?  He was exposed  to R-rated movies  at a very young age  because my sister  and her husband  just felt like  he could handle this stuff.  Okay?  But they also supervised.  But he was watching  R-rated movies  when he was 6,  7, 8 years old  and he was playing  the violent video games  as a kid.  He's pre-med,  he's got over a 4.0  and he's completely fine.  You gotta understand 
[01:12:00]  what your kid could handle.  Yeah, some kids  can handle it.  I'll openly admit,  yeah, some kids,  maybe they can handle  the violence  in the R-rated movies  and stuff like that,  sure.  But my example,  my sister,  I mean,  the kid is completely normal.  Let's wait  until he's a doctor,  though,  and he's injecting people  with cleaning food.  Yeah, right?  He's smothering old people.  I mean,  he's rocking down there  in Florida.  The kid is amazing.  And I remember  going down to Florida  and we're watching Scarface  and all these crazy movies 
[01:12:30]  and he's sitting on the couch  enjoying some ice cream  and popcorn  right alongside us.  I mean,  one of the first rated-art movies  I saw other than Stripes  was Scarface.  And before that,  at that point,  we'd only seen  like Full Love of Benji  and Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo.  And so,  through that chainsaw scene,  really messed me up  as a kid to watch that.  Oh, yeah.  But I never thought  I'm gonna go to school  and go do that to somebody.  You know,  I don't like,  I could have played  that game with the pliers  getting ripped  somebody's eyes out 
[01:13:00]  when I was seven,  eight years old.  I would never think,  ah, I'm gonna do that  to my brother.  Yeah, I wasn't gonna  screw you off  before we were doing that.  We gotta take Frank's call  from Jersey.  Frank, go ahead.  I played a lot of Pac-Man  in the 80s  and I'm kind of overweight now.  I'm thinking about suing.  Yeah, you were influenced  by all that overeating  that the Pac-Man character  does, right?  I developed an appetite  for ghosts.  I'm about 15 pounds  overweight.  I'm suing.  Thanks for calling  Evening at the Improv Bit.  Well, he's just a caller. 
[01:13:30]  He probably works  two jobs, Jimmy.  He's just trying  to get his moment  on a radio show.  I apologize, Frank.  You do as many  dot-eating jokes  as you want.  I play Pac-Man a lot.  Get out of the way,  I might run in circles  and eat dots.  Raise this up  as they all land.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Hey, don't walk  over that manhole.  You're gonna turn blue,  I'm gonna eat you.  This guy's crazy.  And number one  on the list,  of course,  the granddaddy  of violence  is still  Grand Theft Auto.  Yep.  Allows players  to act out crimes 
[01:14:00]  and rewards players  for doing so.  A game that we  are involved with  and might be involved  with in the near future.  You never know.  We love Grand Theft Auto.  We love Rockstar Games.  Sorry to interrupt you.  On the TV right now,  they're showing  a doc,  like they're showing  the John Mayer.  There it is.  Oh my God.  The young John Mayer guy  that shot at the mall.  It's Flea with long hair.  They're showing  the graphic  of the mall,  but it was just  basically a drawing  of the third  and second floor  separated, 
[01:14:30]  and they had  the atrium,  a big rectangle  for the atrium,  and they were just  showing the trail  of the bullets going.  It's the worst  piece of  exploitive graphic.  There's his gun  right there.  That looks more  like a Winchester.  Oh, it is.  Look at that.  Wait a minute.  It's a lever action.  Holds 10 to 12 rounds.  It's an SKS.  SKS semi.  He had two magazines  taken.  But they're showing,  they say semi-automatic,  but then they show 
[01:15:00]  a lever action graphic  on the bottom.  That's not it.  All right.  Hey, let's...  Oh, yeah.  That's an SKS.  Yeah.  We got to grab a break here,  but really fast.  Seth, he's on his way  to school.  Seth, he's 12 years old.  What's up, Seth?  Yeah.  Um, I do love  Grand Theft Auto,  and I watch so many  violent shows  and play so many  violent video games.  I've beat all the  Grand Theft Auto games,  beat the Godfather,  haven't played Scarface  well, and yet,  I don't want to kill 
[01:15:30]  anybody.  I also play Rumble  Roses, Triple X,  but that's a different  story.  Like, um,  that's just the women  beating each other  senseless.  No, no, I'm serious.  Like, it's, it's like  SmackDown versus Raw,  but you're women,  and you beat each other  senseless.  And my favorite character  is the flying  new cow.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  By the way, I want my  Islanders tickets. 
[01:16:00]  Uh, Opie?  I'm not taking too,  do I have to take you  to an Islanders game  now?  Young Seth would like  to, uh, join you at an  Islanders game.  You can make up, uh,  the bad karma that you,  uh, gathered when you,  you, uh, left that  other young boy out in the  cold.  What was his name?  Gary.  Young Gary.  What did he do?  There was a kid, uh,  when we were at NEW,  uh, named Gary.  12-year-old Gary?  Was he 12?  Yeah, he's 38 now.  Yeah.  And, uh, Opie said he  would take him to an  Islanders game, and he 
[01:16:30]  never did.  He never did.  The kid's probably in  college now.  Yeah.  And now, uh, we get  Seth, who wants to go  to an Islander game with  Opie.  That would kind of be  cool, you know?  This reminds me, I  just saw, I don't know  if you want to talk  about it on the air,  because it's your bit,  but I saw Bill, uh,  recently taping, uh,  his DVD, and he  talks about, like,  hanging out with  kids and stuff, and  how you, this day and  age, you don't,  ah, you don't want  to be at an Islander  game with a 12-year-old.  In this day and age,  it could mean just 
[01:17:00]  nothing but trouble.  But it's like, uh,  you know, it's a radio  guy, Seth listens,  and it's...  Mark Parenteau.  It's Mark Parenteau.  And he just, he wants  to go to the game.  You know something?  They so, all they  talk about is sexual  predators now.  The second you  said, this kid wanted  to go to a game with  you, I immediately  felt, oh, that's kind  of weird.  That's going to be a  weird social situation.  But in the old days,  it was just like, hey,  son, we'll go to the  game.  Yeah, exactly.  And if that kid ever  fell down, you'd have  to comfort him from a  distance as he's crying. 
[01:17:30]  You'd have to have, like,  a stick with, like, a  tissue on the end of it.  Trying to wipe his tears  away.  So there's no, any sort  of question of what you  did.  Yeah, because everyone  has cell phones, too,  because all of a sudden  there's a picture of you,  like, holding the  young fella, trying to  comfort him, and now  they twist it into  something else.  Yeah, you're checking  for industry injuries,  and you end up looking  like that guy from  Russia who kissed that  kid on the stomach.  Yeah.  Putin.  Yeah, if I was your  business manager, I  would advise against  a stick with a tissue 
[01:18:00]  on it.  Yeah.  Well, they got us all  paranoid.  Like, after seeing you,  I was in the elevator  going up to my apartment.  There's a mom and a kid  in the elevator.  I'm moving so far away  from the kid.  Oh, yeah.  I could just get  immediately paranoid to  be around strange kids.  That's what I don't like  either.  In any social situation.  I will not be alone in  a bathroom with a little  kid.  No.  Like, if I'm in there  and a little kid's in there,  I walk right the hell out.  Because I don't know  what you...  He touched me! 
[01:18:30]  Wait a minute, I didn't  do anything!  There's a slap in the  cuffs on you.  Mid-urination.  You'd rather get arrested  for peeing in public  than actually be alone  in a bathroom.  Exactly!  I can't even go out  and give my anonymous  horsey rides anymore.  Do you know how frustrating...  I used to give...  I would do is we'd go  for rides and I would  just give little horsey  rides and drop the person  off.  Innocent?  Yeah.  All right.  We've got to say goodbye to Seth.  We've got to take a break.  We're real late.  Bill Burr at Caroline's  all weekend long  starting tonight?  Yep.  212-757-4100 
[01:19:00]  is the number.  And David Tell's going to  be on the show  in a few minutes here?  Good.  We haven't had him on  in years, man.  We'll talk to Dave  in a few minutes.  Well, he's actually here  to talk about my  New Year's Eve show  at the North Fork Theater.  I heard about it.  What city is that in?  It's in Westbury  Music Fair on Long Island.  Oh, I heard about that.  Yeah.  What's the date?  Oh, New Year's Eve.  Wait a minute.  A huge unit  is saying  it would be very funny  if Lindsay  pulled the same gag  with Little Seth  and made you hold his hand  as you're walking  out of the... 
[01:19:30]  All of a sudden,  Obi's walking out  and they switch hands  and you're holding hands  with a young 12-year-old boy.  Big grin on your face.  You heard that story, right?  No.  That was a good one.  Maybe after the break.  I'll tell it again.  Okay.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out  the Opie and Anthony show  featuring Bill Burr  who's going to be  at Caroline's  all weekend long.  We have JC  from New Jersey.  I think he's another  12-year-old  calling the Opie and Anthony show.  JC, what's up? 
[01:20:00]  Adorable.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Anthony, do you want to go  to the Harrisburg gun show  with me?  The gun show?  Sure.  Why not?  Let's go to the gun show.  Hey, this could be  kind of a cool bit.  I'll take a 12-year-old  to an Islander game.  You take a 12-year-old  to like a gun show  and Jimmy could take  a 12-year-old  to a peep show.  Go around the...  Just drive him around  downtown.  Show him the sight  lights.  I don't know.  Maybe I'll take  the little lad  to see Ozzy  at the end of December  here in the Garden. 
[01:20:30]  Oh!  There you go.  Yeah, what is your hobby?  Maybe an Ozzy?  Maybe a rock concert?  Yeah, of course.  Because people know  I love my hockey,  so that's an easy one  for me,  and Ant loves his gun.  Do you go shooting  there, JC?  Yes, I am.  You sound like  the pilot in an airplane.  You like shooting  there, JC?  What's your weapon  of choice?  You like gladiator movies.  What's that?  Yeah.  Peter Graves.  He's a little flustered. 
[01:21:00]  Are you a little nervous?  Don't worry,  there's only about  a million people  listening to you.  Is that your phone?  Yeah, guys, thanks, thanks.  My favorite is,  I own a .22,  my dad gave it to me,  but he is a Springfield.  Yeah.  That's a great weapon  to start off with  as a child,  the .22.  Ah, my father gave me  one of those, too.  What's a .22?  .22 caliber.  It's a little, you know.  Is that just a little  pop-pop?  Yeah.  A little pink,  pink,  little small game. 
[01:21:30]  You do a little hunting.  You can barely kill  a squirrel with it.  Shoot a little squirrel  or a bunny rabbit.  Strike sphere  and rodents  of America.  Yes.  But it's a little rabbit.  You can shoot  little rabbits with it  and stuff.  You know,  learn how to kill early.  How many times,  how many bullets  do you get to pump  into a rabbit  with a .22  before it finally goes down?  Well, let me tell you.  My father,  my father thought  it was 1860  when I was living out there  and he was always  into this man training thing. 
[01:22:00]  Kind of, you know,  man me up a little  because I was such  a little crybaby.  And he gave me  a .22 rifle  and then said,  all right,  go out camping.  I'm giving you one,  you're getting nothing to eat  and one bullet.  Here you go.  And now you've got to  go out and get your dinner.  And he left you?  Shot yourself.  Yeah. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, that would have been hysterical.  He shows up,  I'm just dead.  I shot myself.  Was your jaw askew?  So your dad would be on trial  and that would have been  on the cover of the post.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  It was a different time.  And I had to go out  and shoot a rabbit.  I had one bullet.  Did you get him?  And, well,  I cheated.  I grabbed a handful  of .22 bullets 
[01:23:00]  and put them in my pocket  before the, you know.  So you dragged it.  I took about,  I took about 10 more  and it took,  it took a couple of shots,  you know.  First of all,  it was getting dark.  I'm there with a flashlight  and a .22  and I see little bunny eyes,  you know.  So I go to aim for them  and I missed  and I got,  one I hit in the side  and lost them.  How did you find a rabbit?  That's something you know  how old.  They're all over the place.  How old you are.  Yeah, back then there were.  It was California.  Before global war, man.  Southern California.  All you did was walk  into the woods 
[01:23:30]  with a gun and a flashlight  and I see bunny rabbit eyes.  How did that happen?  Yeah, back then  there were only 46 states.  It was a different time, man.  See, that's a...  Sorry, Bill.  Let me tell you  about a band named Nirvana  one of these days.  Oh, Lord.  I'm sorry,  you young kids.  There was rabbits.  There was California.  You still go out at night.  What happened the first time  you missed?  You hit a mastodon  and stepped in the way  of your shot.  I get it.  Exaggeration humor.  I was going to go with elk 
[01:24:00]  and I was like,  hey, you know...  Mastodon is funny.  Why didn't you have your slave  go and get the rabbit?  Anthony's father was obsessed  with giving him  like manly tasks to do.  Man trained.  It was all these manly tasks.  You're going to go  in the woods  with one bullet  and don't come home  until you bring me  a dead rabbit.  Bring me a rabbit.  And then he got me  for, I think it was  my 14th birthday  or something,  he got me a pistol  and I already had  like a great rifle.  It was like modeled  after Winchester  and he goes, 
[01:24:30]  well,  if I had just gotten  a brand new pistol,  I'd saddle my horse up  and go riding  and go shooting.  He goes,  bring me back something.  I got a rice.  So I went up there  and bagged me  a snake,  a rattler.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh,  I was shooting  at this thing  like crazy.  I must have,  he,  he,  and then I bring  back a rattlesnake.  Why didn't you hit him  with your flashlight?  I should have just  beat him over the head  with a flashlight.  But I felt really  kind of good about it  because the horse  freaked out a little bit 
[01:25:00]  because they don't  like snakes.  So I'm on top  of the horse  trying to shoot  this snake  and,  and blam,  blam,  blam,  blam.  I'm reloading.  I'm pulling out  the rifle.  I'm shooting.  So I go down  and I go,  Dad,  look,  I got a rattlesnake.  He goes,  Jesus Christ,  you should have  come back  with 50 of them  for all the rounds  I heard you go through.  I bet he gets  on the phone  with your,  with his ex-wife.  No pleasing this guy.  But what the hell,  Ro?  The kid can't even  shoot straight.  You didn't give him  a gun,  Joey,  did you? 
[01:25:30]  Gotta give him a gun.  He's got a man up.  You're raising a fruit,  Ro.  You're raising a fruit.  Oh,  stop crying.  Don't fight.  You stop crying.  You stop crying.  That's what he would tell me.  Yeah.  Every time.  You got on a horse  and went out  and shot a rattlesnake?  Where were you living?  It was in Southern California,  like Orange County,  but it was in the hills.  It was...  When?  When?  It was probably 1976. 
[01:26:00]  No,  this is like Dogtown  and Z-Boy days.  Yeah.  It sounded like you grew up  on the Ponderosa.  It was,  because there was  the riverbed  that we used to ride in sometimes.  The riverbed.  The riverbed.  Good Lord.  It had...  Yellowstone.  It was like the flood...  Mice and men were...  It was like the flood control.  It was a dead man's creek.  Was it a hollowed out skull of a bull?  No, it had cement size.  It was like a...  Those things you see the Terminator  riding through on his motorcycle,  you know?  It's got the concrete. 
[01:26:30]  They're always in California.  Let's open a cactus  to get some liquid.  I've done that.  Wanted dinner alive.  See,  when we were in the Mojave Desert,  I learned how to get water  out of cactus  and did that.  Yeah,  I made a big hole  and then I filled up the hole  with cactus  and then put plastic  over the top  and...  Why do I picture you  whimpering through  all of these...  It was.  It was just all...  One,  two,  this.  Basically saying  man versus wild  ripped you off.  Hoo-hoo.  Exactly.  What happened to the cactus? 
[01:27:00]  You get water out of it.  How?  How?  How?  So you dig a hole  and then you line the hole  with slices of cactus  and then you put a cup  in the middle of that  and then you cover  the top of the hole  with plastic  and then take  a single little rock  and put it right in the middle  so it kind of makes  the plastic  in a funnel shape  and as the sun  beats down  on the cactus,  the water evaporates  from the cactus,  collects on the plastic  and since the rock  is in the middle  of the plastic,  it drips downwards  and drips into the cup 
[01:27:30]  and that way  you have liquid  to drink.  Back in the old days,  yeah,  the Indians,  they used to take out  some saran wrap.  You could use actually...  Yeah,  because that happens.  I know the amount of times  I've been stranded  in the wild  and you know,  everybody has saran wrap  on themselves.  Son of a bitch.  You just got a crap on it.  Crap on it.  How do you do it?  You raise a good point.  What?  Plastic?  Do you use anything  that kind of can 
[01:28:00]  collect water  but not absorb it?  You take out  an empty gallon of bleach  that everybody  just always has on it.  These household products  you'd never have.  Can you use like  a t-shirt or something?  No,  it would just absorb  the water.  Then that's just dumb.  What if you only  had bounty towels?  You could squeeze  them into your mouth.  Hey,  we're going to go back  to what Bill  was talking about  because this brings up  a Bill Burr story.  Brandon in Boston  listening on BCM.  What's up?  Hey, 
[01:28:30]  boys.  Hey.  Hey,  I just wanted to go back  to what you were talking  about with the kid  with the Islanders game.  I was actually  in a restaurant bathroom  and it was like  a little girl  just kind of like  running around  in the bathroom  and her dad was like  in the stall  and like totally  unsupervised  and a kid  so I'm like  initially like  uh-oh,  that's not good.  So I waited  like a minute  and I'm like  well,  forget it.  I just got to  get in there  and get out.  So I started  going over  to the urinal  to go to the bathroom  and like 
[01:29:00]  the little girl  starts coming  and like  walking over  and like  peeking in  to like  what she probably  shouldn't see  for another  like 10 years.  So I'm like  whoa,  whoa,  whoa,  no,  no,  no,  no,  don't do that.  And so I'm like  I just zipped up  and like ran out of there  until like  the dad was like  you know  until he left the bathroom  because I'm like  there's no way  I'm getting  like you know  in trouble for this one.  Yeah,  everyone's so paranoid now.  Chris Hansen has made  everyone paranoid  to hang out with kids.  It's as simple as that.  Bill Burr.  Why don't you zip up  and come out here with me?  Right.  What?  I was just 
[01:29:30]  Bill Burr has an elevator story  and that started  that whole bit that  That's how I got the bit.  The way how I got the bit  was I was in my building  and me and this other guy  were waiting for the elevator.  It started coming up  and I just hear  this kid screaming.  This little kid screaming  and the door opened up  as this little  like five-year-old girl  with nobody else screaming.  I kind of figured out  like you know  a couple seconds  that somehow  she got on the elevator  the doors closed.  Stupid kids.  I left mommy behind  or whatever.  Yeah,  she was downstairs  so we walked in there  the big dude  is not even addressing 
[01:30:00]  that the kid is even there  and I basically  was like crouching down  going okay what  but like keeping  like I was crouching  it was weird to say  I was crouched down  like four feet away  so it was probably  even more weird.  I was just like  and I was just in my head  the whole time  I was like  I got to figure out  where this kid's mom is  but in no way  shape or form  am I coming in  any contact  with this kid  if the kid's falling down  like maybe if I have  like a pen  I'll try to catch  the back of the car.  You even made  too much contact there 
[01:30:30]  by even talking to her.  Oh yeah.  Because the kid  oh what happened  who was that man  that I don't know  but he touched me  oh and they're  going to listen to you.  No I was just  helping the  ow  ow my head  it's in the cement  and your knee  is in my neck.  Single white male  late 30s  never been married  totally fits the profile  you're the profile  it's over.  You're just trying  to help the kid  and next thing you know  that's the point on here  you can't help  children anymore.  No you just can't.

These kids  I swear to God  these kids now  everybody has  that horrific  embarrassing moment 
[01:31:30]  when you were a kid  and it just went away  but now it gets filmed  that's going to follow  the dude to college  somebody throws  a skateboard at him  and the way  this kid cries  Really?

[01:33:00]  Very very cool  Hey how's it going guys  Thanks for having me in  after the pedophile  long remakes bit  Were you guys talking  about Chris Hansen  and all that  Yeah  He's kind of ruined it  for everybody  You can't really hang out  with a kid  in an innocent way anymore  because adults  are just paranoid  Did anybody  because you guys know  like Bill or whatever  Who has the joke  where they go like  Chris Hansen  is the blade  of catching  you know  of like pedophilia  Blade  Remember like  what's his name  like he's like  half vampire  half whatever  He like knows 
[01:33:30]  their ways  knows what they like  you know  It's like mall rock climbing  Sounds like a place  for a pedophile to hang  Yeah he knows  But Dave  he's got to take a serum  to keep himself  from just  going out there  and abusing kids himself  You bring up a great point  Chris Hansen  has sat on that couch  a couple times  He has  There's something  not right about him  When you look in his eyes  you're like  what is this really about Chris  He's got a double side  to him  and you know  I think that  you know  everybody wants to be  on that show  I think that's the new 
[01:34:00]  Byron Allen  You know  it was kind of  flattering  sort of for our show  because one of our  listeners got caught  on one of those things  and goes  oh I saw you  on Opie and Anthony  once  He goes  you were great  on Opie and Anthony  Oh you saw me  on Opie and Anthony  Management doesn't really  like when we play  this clip  because it's not good  for Madison Avenue  but  It's a holiday clip  The guy actually  heard Chris Hansen  on our show  and still got caught  in one of those houses  Let's just  you know  they should turn  lemons into lemonade  and just have the sales people  go after 
[01:34:30]  Osh gosh bagosh  And then Chris Hansen  wants our emails  one day  He's like  hey you know  I've been on the show  a couple times  how about we exchange emails  I'm like  oh boy  F no  That's one thing  you don't want  I'm not hiding anything  but that's the last thing  you want to do  is give Chris Hansen  any of your info  Here's an email  from Greg.Hughes  I was in New York  going into a restaurant  one time  and it was like  a celebrity sighting  that only I think  Jim and Bill  we would enjoy  You know the people 
[01:35:00]  that play the bait  on that show  like they're like  these kind of  tweener looking girls  you know like  actresses  they couldn't get  in a high school musical  or anything like that  because it's what  they're doing  you know  So I saw one of those  girls because I was  watching the show  you know Chris Hansen  and I was like  that's that girl  she's the bait  you know she'd be  like the one  I'll be out in a minute  you know  you know  take off your pants  and if you've got  a gun or a taser  or a ball gag  put it on the counter  you know  if you want to start  dialing a lawyer  you know that 
[01:35:30]  that little like  you know  Pollyanna thing  start dialing a lawyer  yeah so it's like  I saw her in a restaurant  with the girl  from Sex in the City  the redhead one  kind of butch  what's her name  what  Cynthia Nixon  whatever she plays  on the show  I don't know  so I went up to them  they were sitting  at the table  I go I'm a huge fan  and like Cynthia  is like  and I go no  I was like  of you  but really of the bait  of this girl  you really recognized her  come on  yeah I did  and I got an autograph 
[01:36:00]  and I'm like  and I looked at  what she signed  and it said like  thanks for the blah blah  stay off of my space  wink wink  so that's where  they're you know  they're just joking  about it  that's hysterical  I sent a my space  message to the girl  one of the girls  who plays the bait  the original one  and she said  I'm trying to get her  on the show  and she said  well you have to  contact producers  and stuff like that  she wouldn't just  come on the show  yeah I'm sure  that's my space  right here  I forget her real name  but yeah  she's accessible  I'm sure that's why  you first sent it  she's really cute  she's like 20  hey before  can't bring nothing 
[01:36:30]  but a t-shirt  before the break  Bill turned us  on to this video  and that's what you saw  as you walked in  Dave was all laughing  as you're trying  to say hi to everybody  I apologize for that  but on YouTube  there's a video  called Wussy Skater Fight  you want to explain  this again Bill  we finally got it  yeah it's basically  some sort of fat kid  has some sort of  a whip or something  a stick  he tries to hit  this little skinny kid  with a skateboard  he hits him once  and then the kid  just takes his skateboard  I think he hits him  in the back of his thigh  it's like charley horse area 
[01:37:00]  yeah  and the kid goes down  like he's been shot  with I don't know what  and lets out this whale  like I don't know  like a loved one  just died  and he's not going to  live this down  is what you're saying  they're about  how old would you say  they are  14  13  yeah maybe around there  and the fat kid  that winds up crying  at the end  whipped the kid  with like a  what could only be  called a switch  back in the old days  go out and grab a switch  a bit of hickory  yeah some hickory  and hits him with it 
[01:37:30]  and the kid just came back  and throws a skateboard at him  which you should do  right  and you would think  he would just go  ah you know  F you  or something like that  but he just goes  flat down  and lets out a cry  that only a girl would  listen for the cry  it's quick  why does that end  that's fantastic  who turned the camera off  that was very  gone up and kicked him 
[01:38:00]  yeah he's  that's it  I want the long version  of that  that's all it is  the video's  11 seconds long  I had to watch it  like 5 times  to even realize  it wasn't fake  I'm like there's no way  he just cried  like he's one of those  kids who's already  like 6'2  but he still hasn't  hit puberty  and all those kids  he still has all  the baby fat  yeah  and there he is  crying on the street  one more time  hey add that to the 
[01:38:30]  speech sounds  they can mix that  into some rocks  laughing stock  like a haunted  pottery barn  and then people are  bringing up the other  video of the fat kid  on the log  in the woods  that's another good  one  what are they  shooting at him  or something  yeah they're  shooting at him  with some kind  of gun  I don't know  BB gun or  something  they're saying  that's the best  crying video  stop stop  he starts crying  stop it  that's the best  kid crying video 
[01:39:00]  all these little  moments that used  to just happen  and were gone  when you were a  kid I mean  everyone knew  those situations  you know you had  the kid that  you'd smack in the  head you'd have  a dirt bomb fight  and someone would  throw a rock  everyone would run  they were just  moments but now  I mean they're  captured for  everyone to  enjoy the humor  of some little  kid getting hurt  amazing  I love it  it seems to be  fat kids with  friends with  cameras  yeah  as long as  you got a  camera 
[01:39:30]  few friends  and the fat  kid  you're in  you're making  YouTube  hey Tubbs  what are you up  to today  I'll bring my  camera  want to come  out to the  woods  come on out  to the woods  lord of the  flies  sounds better  than a fat  boy being  whipped  it's just a  bad dream  fat boy  ow  ow  skateboard  ow  why  why  where is the  Sean Penn of 
[01:40:00]  their generation  to protect  like in bad  boys  you know  he like  sit up for  that kid  with the  nose  yeah  yeah  where's that  where's the  show  hey that's  not right  leave piggy  alone  give me that  tape  all right  hey  we got a  woman that's  upset with  her butt  implants  you want  to hear  this  what  just kind  of throwing  some stuff  into the  old CD  player here  yeah sure  David Tell  HBO this  Sunday  also Caroline's  the December  27th through  30th  oh first let  me clear  something up  with Dave 
[01:40:30]  because oh  my god  I was down  at the  cellar  put down  the camera  put down  the camera  you're not  going to  whip me  put down  the camera  you're not  going to  whip me like  a West  Virginia fat  boy or  you  I was  down at  the cellar  catching your  set  laughing  when  oh this  is a  while ago  yeah a  while ago  thanks  I am an  alcoholic  so am I  really  yeah why not  I had a  table with  three girls  at the table  and me 
[01:41:00]  sitting there  enjoying the  set  in front of  us closer  to the stage  was another  table full  of what I  would gather  you comics  just call  pains in the  ass  get out  of the  effing  club  you're  yapping  you're  making  okay  you're  just  making  a very  difficult  time  for the  comic  okay  yeah  so  you  turned  around  looked  right  at me  and pointed  at me  now I  had been  going to  comedy clubs  for years  I'm 
[01:41:30]  friends  with a lot  of comics  I know  the protocol  shut the  F up  laugh  at the  funny  parts  don't  try to  be the  act  for the  night  he's  up  on  stage  you  lambasted  me  I did  as the  guy  that was  making  the  noise  and  and then  I'm  saying  I  even  tried  much  I  didn't  have  the  mic  so  I  tried  I  was  like  no  it's  not  me  shut  up  you  laid  into  me  and I  was  sitting  there  like  it's  not  me  I  know  how  to  act  in  a  comedy 
[01:42:00]  club  and then  everyone's  looking at  me  like  I'm  the  douche  hey  you  know  what  I hate  to be  all  blackwater  about  it  but  collateral  damage  the boys  will back  me up  here  you know  sometimes  I have  to say  one thing  don't  apologize  because I  saw  gym  special  and when  you two  stood  up  it was  amazing  it was  a sea  of seat  fillers  and  people  who  promised  if you  come to  this  you might  get on  America's 
[01:42:30]  dancing  with  the  stars  you  guys  are  the  most  blend  in  the  bowl  people  I've  ever  seen  I  know  now  I'm  like  yeah  I  have  seen  you  at  the  club  but  you  like  blend  right  in  I  know  I  all  of a  sudden  was  the  a-hole  no  it  actually  made  for a  funny  story  I  was  just  I  was  so  pissed  that  night  I  was  helping  him  I  was  helping  better  I  know  he  needs  someone  to  work  off  of  if  you  could  come  if  we 
[01:43:00]  all  have  to  pitch  together  because  there's  a problem  and I'm  glad  you guys  are  inundated  right now  in this  city  with  Europeans  with a lot  of money  that's  worth  as much  as our  money  this  hasn't  happened  since  I  don't  know  when  maybe  the  1800s  or  something  there's  Canadian  people  walking  around  like  they  have  a  real  country  there's  all  these  Europeans  they come  down to the  comedy cellar  and they  just stare  they don't  get it  and then  you have  to attack  them  because  it brings  up  your own  inner  self-hatred  they're  kind of 
[01:43:30]  verifying  what you  already  know  the Canadians  are feeling  pretty important  right now  their money's  worth more  than ours  for the first  time in a  long time  right  a little  more  and it's  like  when did  that  happen  we goofed  on their  money for  years  I think  it's even  Steven  right now  and the  shekel is  coming up  I saw  Bill Burr  recently  I gotta keep  going back  to the last 
[01:44:00]  time I saw  you  he was  taping  his latest  DVD  and he's  killing  man  killing  it was a  big theater  downtown  and remember  the guy  was completely  asleep at  your show  and you're  like  what the  my whole  set  there was  this guy  like I  mean like  that  your head  wakes you  up  not even  just a  little tired  this guy  was like  you know  you know  what I  found out  later  he was  one of  the guys  in the  crowd  he was  on  something  and he  was freaking  people out  this is  gonna be  awesome  and you  know by  the time  the show  started  he was  like  passed  out  so of course  this kid's  like right  in the third  row 
[01:44:30]  so the entire  time  you know  as a comedian  that's all  I'm focusing  on  this DVD  is gonna  put people  to sleep  they're gonna  nod off  this is  I suck  I'm terrible  it had nothing  to do with  Bill Burr  you should have  smashed him  and said  something like  gee sir  am I keeping  you up  I was like  when you see  the guy  he's sleeping  and he's  like wearing  a suit  so you know  like he's  not like  trash or  anything  or whatever  and then  like later  you find out  it's like  well I'm  sorry  hey dude  what's the  matter  not funny  blah blah blah  and then  it's like  I run a

[02:01:00]  very minimal  of getting breakfast  and coffee  a lot more  you know  hands on  oh so what you're saying  is we pretty much  didn't really give you  a chance to do anything  we  I know that's what they told you  it's going to be a lot of  hands on  hands on the coffee  have they given you the speech  you know  the make believe  he's straight speech  yet or  maybe they wait for you  to actually start working there  don't ask  don't ask  and I didn't mention a name 
[02:01:30]  by the way  let's just keep it right there  of course  the make believe  he's straight speech  you're going to be getting  that one soon  did  what happened here  that you didn't like  anything happened here  that you didn't like  you can say now  besides Pat Duffy  no  come on  what happened  that you don't like  tell us  you can touch the last day  this is it  we'll never see you again  I don't want to leave  on bad terms  don't worry  we'll never have you back  can you actually  give an honest assessment  of pretty much everybody  in this room  that you've worked with  and stuff  give an honest assessment  of the people 
[02:02:00]  that you've worked with  oh that's good  it's kind of right  I knew this was going to  kind of quickly  just like you know  leave on an honest note  everybody  well yeah yeah  or anyone that comes to mind  don't leave anything out  things that you didn't like  about people  you know  put that in there  just give a quick overview  on  let's start with E-Rock  awesome  awesome  yeah I  honestly  you're going to bring him  to Z100 with you right  he's going to start crying  you know what  never mind  I was going to say something  say it 
[02:02:30]  say it  if you're ugly  I'll take his job  wow  alright  so you want to sit  and do nothing all day  that's what I do now  no I'm kidding  whoa  oh hey  hotility  okay  Sam  how do you feel about Sam  Sam  I wish I could learn  more about the videotaping  I wanted to learn  you want to do everything  well you know what  you don't understand  what's going on here Anthony  she's basically saying  that she didn't really  what did you learn 
[02:03:00]  from us  how to get coffee  how to get coffee  every store  I know where to go  and get to see  you learned a little  geography around Manhattan  you know what  I'll be honest with you  here's why  everybody was probably  so petrified  of like  being alone  with you to do anything  because of some kind of  you might have said  oh my god  he touched me  you know that  Bill Burbit  because it would have been  it probably would have been 
[02:03:30]  nice to go like  hey let me show you  some production  or something  and how that works  let's go alone  in the production room  and then all of a sudden  you come out  and you know  your sweaters askew  I know right  hold on  that's how you move up  you're  mace  they're in the  guy's eyes  basically what Ann's saying  is you're a victim  of past sexual harassment  cases  yeah yeah  I'd love to agree with that  but I think it's just  that everybody's lazy  everyone's just lazy  this young woman  starting out her career  in broadcast  you guys are  totally dumping on that  I know  isn't that awful 
[02:04:00]  when you were a little girl  did you get home  set up a lot of little knobs  and stuff like that  like woo  you're on  call her  bring bring bring  no  tin cans with string  tied to them  so what didn't you want to say  you can give an honest assessment  you have a few minutes left  don't hold back  that's what  I just wish I could have  learned more about production  and more  who could have showed you  who should have showed you  anybody  who basically wishes  she could have learned something  what's the worst thing you said  what's the worst thing you said  off air  when you walked out of here  when you really started 
[02:04:30]  bitching about how you weren't  learning anything  God  Dovey has to sit in studio  every single day  if he's not even here right now  that's why I'm saying it  why didn't you just ask somebody though  because  just in case they  might not  I don't know  honestly  I don't know why I didn't ask  squeaky wheel  I told Renee one time  I said one time  if you have any bit ideas  or any of that stuff  you should come right to us  with bit ideas  so you're going to do the last  what Renee thinks is funny bit 
[02:05:00]  yes  you even had your own bit  you had your own  you had your own bit  you know what though  I did not expect that  and I do appreciate that  I don't think you'll get  your own bit over at Z100  no I don't  tell you the truth  I don't think I will  I don't think you'll get your own bit  unless it's who's the least funny person  in the room  and you just sleepily point  at all of them  well this is what  Renee thinks is funny today  okay  watch it be Elvis Duran  that would be the move to make  that would be good  basically this is a three year old  and he's asked about monsters  yeah  and you found this funny 
[02:05:30]  well it was like the  I completely forgot  what the other one was about  where she  sparkling wiggles  you brought sparkling wiggles  no no no  it's similar to that  no no no  not that at all  it's very similar  but not that  okay  alright this is what  Renee finds funny  here it is  and tell mommy again  what you said  you were going to do to him  if he came here  I said  I'm going to kick his ass  oh  that's not nice  if he's going to come in here 
[02:06:00]  he's going to kick my ass  um  he  he will  yeah  he'll come out in a movie  he'll come out  he'll come out and kick my ass  okay  if I can kick his ass  okay  but that's not a nice word  you should say kick his butt  oh 
[02:06:30]  what's the difference really  let's stop  aww  that's only funny  if that kid is 17  that's adorable  little kids cursing  you find funny  yeah  I do too  to tell you the truth  you never have to ask  what you say  but you do anyway  just to hear him say it again  yeah  something about little kids cursing  is really funny  I didn't like the way  the mother milked it though  yeah  yeah  she milked it like 8 times  what  and then she says it  and then she goes  oh say butt  to try to redeem herself  I gotta do an honest moment  after hearing that audio  I don't know how the show 
[02:07:00]  survives without Renee  well  since I'm half hard  I really  something about that  with a little lisp  at the end  it was like very Kramer  versus Kramer  can I have some  chalky  cheap kooky  like you know  like too cute  you know  alright well  here's the awkward moment  where we tell Renee  goodbye  she wouldn't say  anything mean by anybody  though  that's alright  but I'm not a mean person  she's gotta  you gotta have  some kind of problem  with something  she crashes  when she leaves  she says stuff  yeah  you know she does  you do  so let some stuff 
[02:07:30]  out then  who do you think  is the biggest incompetent  here  on staff or interns  either or  either or  first on staff  no  come on  you might as well  no  I'm not going  no you should be  because it will help us  help us on the way out  because you have no motive  to lie  yeah so they don't lose  anybody again  as it  no  you're very popular  god is she perfect  for Z100  or what 
[02:08:00]  she's already  anyone else noticing this  she's anticipating  the silly string party  they're going to have  how they greet you  over there  welcome aboard  hey  welcome aboard  you're more of a  coming up  another eight in a row  type intern  she's perfect for that  type of radio  perfect  and there's nothing  wrong with that  you can't let him say that  now you gotta come back  with something  you gotta attack him  come on  I got nothing  yes you do  you're sitting on it  that causes cancer 
[02:08:30]  you can't sit on stuff  like that  you gotta let it out  does it really  watch  I will come back  with something so good  I'm like  I should have said that  but not right now  I can't  let her turn her knob  well Pat Duffy  is requesting your  goodbye music  this is it for you  this is the sad  walking away music  from Hulk  are you gonna miss  Duffy  no  we're cool  but he just  I don't know  I'm not  you do  you do know  yeah what 
[02:09:00]  once they find out  you're gonna get so  trashed  I said that's great  I'm doing what I  want to do  I believe you don't  care  there was a little  love thing going on  between her and Pat  Duffy back in the day  a year ago  a year ago  absolutely not  what  it was a year ago  a year ago  yeah they did  did it end with  the baby bird  was he any good  no  wow  we did nothing more  he kissed me  and that was it  nah there was more 
[02:09:30]  no honestly there wasn't  that Abe licking beard  coming at you  did he bite your ass  why was he bad  if he just shaved  you'd be a lot better  is it this guy  yeah Dan wants in  what Dan go ahead  just talk  no no go ahead  please  this other fried rock  kid over here  what's up Dan  well  Renee has mentioned  that she's less  comfortable when  certain people are  not here  and I just want to 
[02:10:00]  know who that was  if you could say  and why  I was less  comfortable  we don't have a lot  of time so I'll say  Steve and Jim  just to get it  oh yeah  get the ball rolling  there was a day  that you weren't here  and Steve wasn't here  and every day  you're so used to  everyone being around  and they weren't here  and it just felt weird  and I was like  I don't know  I like the Jim part  but the Steve part  yeah you kind of  wrecked it  kind of wrecked it  by saying Steve  Pat Duffy squealed 
[02:10:30]  on her  and actually  that day that  Steve and Jim  weren't here  this is all from  Pat Duffy  it's not from me  that day Steve and Jim  weren't here  and the same day  the next day  she came and got  on the train with Pat  because they got  on the train together  light rail  and she said  you know  I felt uncomfortable  yesterday  because Steve and Jim  weren't here  and then Pat was like  well you know  Steve and Jim  probably aren't going  to be here today  either  and she was like  oh really  and then 30 seconds 
[02:11:00]  later she had a  mysterious stomach ache  and she was not able  to come in  let me explain  those actually  were not my words  in general conversation  I said you know  it was just a little weird  without having Jimmy  and Steve there  you know  you're so used to  having everyone there  every day  and they weren't there  it was weird  it was awkward  it's understandable  I'm eye candy  I have a general  conversation with him  and he has to just  tell the whole freaking world  yeah  that's why I tell him 
[02:11:30]  absolutely nothing  was he a good kisser  no  wow  because he just  if he just shaved  it would have been  I don't know  it was a year ago  I don't care  did he have good tongue motion  you know what  I don't remember  oh boy  that's not very good  that's not a good  selling point for him  I don't even talk about Duff anymore  he's very forgettable  that's what he's saying  let's all acknowledge  that the last 10 minutes  of radio  was just god awful  and speaking of which  I'm going to miss Renee  and the listeners  will accept that  as an apology  yes sorry guys  Renee enjoys the 100

[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Can I use it?  Can I say it now?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  What's up, motherfuckers?  You love curse words.  We turn into like, I don't know, like 17-year-olds or something.  You just got to get it out of your system. 
[02:17:30]  Right away.  Jimmy's doing drugs.  Jimmy's doing drugs.  Yes.  Oh, no.  What is that?  Chlamydia?  No.  That's a big bottle, too.  That is.  Uh-oh.  AZT.  Oh, boy.  It's Allegra D.  AZT.  Oh, no.  Allegra.  I like the Allegra D.  It's good for my allergies so I don't sneeze in cars.  Is that what it is?  I got to get glasses.  I was over at that optical place.  What's allergies when it's snowing?  Glasses?  Yeah.  A young lad like you.  How old are you now?  I'll be 40 in July.  I was putting a...  I'm getting the lens surgery, so I had to wear glasses for a couple weeks to let my eyes 
[02:18:00]  go back to normal.  And I was just looking at myself in the mirror, put on glasses, and I'm looking at my fat  neck, and I'm like, you look like you're about to turn 40.  I wanted to commit suicide in the fucking office.  Did you?  No.  No, Jimmy.  You are not going to be 40.  I'm 39 years old.  I'm 39.  Are you going to have a big 40 like me and my dudes?  We're going to go to baseball camp.  Oh, God.  And we're going to run midget NASCARs and have the biggest state you've ever fucking seen.  Are you going to do the guy thing?  He's going to go on a mancation. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, is that awful.  A mancation with his pals.  We're going to parachute into Ecuador.  It's going to be great.  We're going to hit a couple of strip clubs, right, guys?  You strip clubs.  I really want to get around some golf.  Back to being pussy whipped.  I really want to get a stripper and then impale her on a coat hanger, and then me and my friends  rape her and then try to cover it up.  That's what I want to find.  Well, that's a good 40th adventure.  The translation.  Didn't Jon Favreau do that movie?  Didn't Jon Favreau do that movie?  Yeah. 
[02:19:00]  I was about a bachelor party or something that went awry.  I'm such an idiot.  That's like the reference, and I'm like, and I just name the reference.  Didn't that movie do that?  Hang in the shower and cut you up with a chainsaw?  Didn't he do that in Scarface?  Yeah, Bill.  That's what I'm talking about.  Fucking idiot.  Oh, Bill, stop giving yourself the business.  Oh, wait.  Was that Amy Stossman out there?  Yeah.  We're going to get him in a few minutes.  Oh, okay.  I was wondering who that guy was.  I just got to mention something.  Bill Burr's playing Caroline's all weekend long, and we were discussing as Ecstasy of  Gold was playing that Bill and I finally acknowledged something. 
[02:19:30]  The last time I went and saw him filming his DVD, we went out and had a few beers and stuff,  and we finally looked at each other and went, let's finally admit this.  Yeah, we've never.  I don't know if anybody who's listened to the show.  It was an unspoken thing between Bill and I for years that we just didn't really fuck  with each other because we'd come from the same place.  A bad place.  A bad place.  An evil place.  An evil place that no good could come of it.  No, I just knew.  I always knew, like, the second I saw it, like, maybe, like, three, four days on this 
[02:20:00]  show, I don't know what, there was just something in your eye, and I was just like, if I, yeah,  I know his childhood, I know how he grew up, I have the same stories.  If I ever lock horns with this guy, it'll be the last day I'm on this show because it'll  just get fucking evil.  And then five minutes later, you're kissing, you're fucking rubbing his back.  But Bill and I have, like, issues about really dumb stuff, and this comes up because you  were saying you were going through an airport, and people, authority figures in general are  just driving you nuts, right?  Just that guy saying nine zillion times to take your laptop out, and, like, it's like 
[02:20:30]  I fucking got, and I, like, literally get to, like, such a seething rage every time I  go through, like, airport security.  See, I can understand that, but I'm from a completely different place.  I see it as these motherfuckers, even though I really don't like the security people at  all, but the morons they have to deal with on a daily basis that don't fucking do what  they say.  That just walk, and they're the motherfuckers, not the security people, they're the fucking  assholes that make the line so long.  The people that didn't take, oh, I take my shoes, the laptop I need to do. 
[02:21:00]  I could fucking go through security in a second.  I'm fucking through.  I know it has to be done.  Old people suck.  Around the holidays.  Fucking, uh, uh, uh, old house frow women fucking suck that travel once a fucking decade.  But see, you brought-  I'm a bit just like this, by the way.  Bill just wrecked.  Oh, okay.  Bill wrecked it by bringing up the wrong-  Oh, me too.  The funny questions they ask you?  I'm not saying that those guys, those people bug me too, but I'm saying- 
[02:21:30]  You brought up the wrong example.  I'm talking more like you're at a street fair, and it's in your, you've told this, you know,  the, you've done the bit many times where you just want to punch muffins because it feels  good.  That's the man you can relate to.  Well, beating up-  Let me in on it.  Where are you guys from?  Boston, right?  I don't know where he's from, but no.  I'm just a long-round kid.  No, it's his whole mindset.  Oh, the mind-  Okay.  No, like I was, uh, in the dentist's office yesterday.  Lindsay got some wisdom teeth pulled, and, uh, I'm sitting there in the waiting room,  and she's, uh, filling out paperwork, and this lady sat next to me with a big fucking 
[02:22:00]  coat and cloths-  What's with Novocaine?  And, and hat, and a hat, and she had a planner and a big fucking pocketbook, and everyone  else is being very considerate and being quiet with their-  Even, like, just turning a page of a magazine, you're just trying to be, you know, considerate  of everybody around you, and she's just, like, going through her shit, taking her coat  off, putting it back on.  Big stupid coat.  And even her writing was just really loud, and Lindsay's, like, Lindsay's looking at  me, and she's getting the minor, you know, surgery done, and she's looking at me, like, 
[02:22:30]  don't do it, don't do it, and I'm this close to fucking making a massive scene.  Wrapping the coat around her head and just belting her in the face as many times as you  could.  That's what I'm talking about.  Bill and I can relate on that level, and she's not really doing anything wrong, but  in my mind, she is a major fucking problem and needs to be taken care of.  Yeah.  Just because she's writing and writing, and she's got post-its, and now she's going through  her wallet, and then she goes and gets her insurance card, and now she has to open everything  to put the insurance card back at that moment, I'm like, and I'm losing my fucking mind. 
[02:23:00]  Dude, I always felt that vibe, and then that one day when Poe took that kid down on the  sidewalk, and I saw you snap, like, how do you like that, motherfucker?  That was like, that's the guy, that's the guy, I knew it, I knew he had that in him.  That's the guy.  You were smiling right along, though, like, okay, good, good, I'm not alone.  You missed an opportunity in that dentist's office, you could have slammed that fucking  bitch, when she was making a lot of noise, and she said, hey, why don't you keep it down  to a dull roar?  Oh, boy, that would have showed her.  It's just, it's...  Like, I got a...  She said, you got moxie. 
[02:23:30]  Were you raised in a helicopter factory?  Huh?  I got a parking ticket once, and I marched around the neighborhood for 40 minutes looking for  the guy, and Lindsey's like, what are you going to do when you find him?  I'm like, I don't know, but I need to fucking find the guy now.  Who looks, tries to look for the traffic agent that gave you a ticket?  Dude, like, he's insane, because I double parked in front of my place to take some luggage  out, it was a weekend, long weekend, whatever, and we came back to the apartment, I'm unloading  the car before I go find parking.  At the time that I grabbed my bags, went inside, came back out, I had a ticket, I was out of 
[02:24:00]  my fucking mind, I had to find the guy.  I never did.  It happens to me at least once a day, I get to that level of rage.  Wow.  That's not healthy.  Yeah, it's brutal.  I've been trying to, like, on the way out here, once again, in an airport, and for some  reason, I stick my, you know, the credit card in, it doesn't work, you need to see a gate  agent, so I go outside, I try to do the Skycap thing, he tells me I have to go see a gate  agent, so I give the guy five bucks, he puts me in the short line, and there's only one  person working our line, and it's like, as I'm standing there, the guy up there, like 
[02:24:30]  had overpacked his bag, it's like this Mexican dude, he has like a box with like a string,  and he's trying to tie, and like the cowboy hat, and dude, that was it, and just every  other word is fuck, is coming out of my mouth, and there's kids, and it's just not good.  See, that kind of stuff I can understand, because when I'm put in situations where I have to deal  with other people fucking me over, that's what gets me.  When I watch the news and say, well, a lot of people are angry at the airlines for the  delays, it's not the fucking airlines, it's the idiots that don't know what the fuck they're 
[02:25:00]  doing, like jackass with the luggage, people that don't know, when they bring their fucking  carry-on, and it's a god, it should go into a cargo plane, never mind the fucking like baggage  compartment, it should have a C-130 just for this guy's fucking carry-on, and he's trying  to jam it in, and they're saying to check it, and he doesn't want to check it, and strollers  are fucking going up and going down that little slide, it's just, people are stupid, and I get 
[02:25:30]  in line to do anything, and I make sure it takes two seconds, just so in my head I could  go, see, see how fast that could fucking go, you ever go, now Jim's showing a little, he's  got his prescription over there, pharmacies are amongst the worst fucking places for lines,  because you're dealing with old motherfuckers that don't understand anything, so they go  to get their prescription filled, I'll be behind one person, an old person, and they'll  go, well, my Medicare card should take care of that, no, you gotta call your doctor, you're 
[02:26:00]  over the limit of something, whatever the problem is, they can't grasp it, it's not  even in their head unless some fucking big band music is playing, in the band, all right,  Mrs. Green, we'll get that right to you, I'll have the delivery, boys, send it over.  Here's the difference, I was at the Dwayne Reed yesterday filling a prescription, and I was  the guy that said hurry the fuck up that's the difference like i can't help myself i'll throw 
[02:26:30]  money at people that argue over over like 12 cents coupons and shit like that it's like but  the coupon has this she goes but it's expired but it says that i i take money out of my pocket  and i go there leave i'm i'm in a hurry i take your shoes off what is with the shoes and the  old people because i'm sorry i wanted to say something at some point you uh i made the wall  i actually have been online where an old woman had to take her shoes off and we had to convince her 
[02:27:00]  that she would get them back once they went through the magical machine and i said they're  going to be better shoes on the other side everything you've ever loved is going to be  alive again it's like a twilight zone episode it's going to be a swimming hole in a gazebo  all that all that dirt from those graves you'll be in willoughby yes stop willoughby willoughby 
[02:27:30]  yeah good point you're talking about dude i addressed all that on my new cd uh don't get  me started oh jim world i can see the cover you with a fist shaking it it's just me looking  around exasperated and like crazy this happened it's really funny it sounds it you know how many  comedians have done that thing where they you know they create their utopia and it's just their  name plus world like you know jim world and then that's like your whole thing you know you know how 
[02:28:00]  this happened like demented world opening anthony's demented world that we put out oh did you put  that out oh we put one of those out oh god but it was you know what 19 years ago 65 i think  let's go to peter in massachusetts he's got a question for it peter go ahead hi hey good morning  hi hey anthony what's it like to be so smart and so much better than everybody else you know what i'll 
[02:28:30]  tell i'll tell you the truth it's a pain in the fucking ass ignorance is truly bliss and i wish i  was a lot more stupid than i am but i'm too fucking smart for my own good i walk around looking at  idiots on a daily basis i hate human beings i don't know why i'm one of them i don't like driving with  them i don't like eating with them i don't like anything about people i'm not supposed to be here  are you ever worried about your road rage when you're driving around telling everybody to f off  that someone might just decide to fuck with you at some point first of all no because no one ever 
[02:29:00]  drives faster than me so they'd never catch me like the people that get road rage and they get shot  the person has to catch up to them to shoot them that never happens with me and uh i'm pretty i've  mellowed out with my road rage a little it takes a real fucking asshole to get me pissed and peter that  that shouldn't be a worry because most people just uh go after soft targets anyway you know  the soccer mom doesn't have a gun when you're fucking with her exactly i guess i'm gonna ask  you what makes you think the traffic laws don't apply to you like they apply to everybody else 
[02:29:30]  uh you bend the laws i know because and i'll tell you why i'll be honest with you we got a do-gooder  i know i'll be honest with you god i hate you the last man on earth i know  i know enough cops and have talked to enough cops to know what is the actual law and what's  get away with a bull and i'm not i'm not talking about like every mention you have those cards that  you have pba cards but i'm not saying i'm not saying i'm impervious to fucking you know uh getting  a ticket or anything like that it happens but you know i could go faster than the speed limit and if 
[02:30:00]  you're not going to do that get the fuck out of the left lane that's that's well what about when you  say you draw up on the sidewalks and well okay i'm gonna sit there while a truck is taking about  20 minutes to back into a loading dock blocking the entire street and not drive on the fucking  sidewalk that no one's walking on i'm not plowing over pedestrians like a grand theft auto but if it's  open i'm gonna drive on the sidewalk get around the truck and be on my merry way and leave the 
[02:30:30]  fucking line of idiots that want to sit there peter's all about safety first attaboy peter  i'm all about i'm all about ten and two right bro ten and two come on give me that ten and two  you are a pussy oh hey seriously though when you drive up on the shoulder and you're stuck in like  a traffic jam that's right everybody's late for work you just get up on the fucking grass and blah  bye everybody you're right yeah because you got your stupid fucking get out of jail free card  nobody's got that you're right it's like my grandmother used to say hooray for me the hell with 
[02:31:00]  you huh i am taking a chance that i will get a ticket believe me it's not a get out of jail free  fucking card it's if the guy's in a good mood uh he might let me off the hook but if not i take my  own chance if i'm fucking doing 120 in uh uh 55 i don't think a pba card's gonna help it's taking  chances but uh you know what are you gonna do there are people that take chances that's what i do and  then there's uh people like peter ten and two ten and two oh keep it safe keep it safe kids you 
[02:31:30]  are a goody gumdrops he gets a little crazy out there sometimes he goes 57 miles an hour stay in the  right lane then you know what i'll bring up a prime example and it happens every fucking morning  and this morning it happened again i'm uh in the left lane of course some idiot doesn't want to  fucking get out of my way it's in the morning too it's like four four in the morning so no one's  on the road but this idiot's got to be in the left lane i understand this i'm not even gonna get  on his ass and make a move i'll make the move so i go to the middle lane the same time i'm doing it 
[02:32:00]  a van comes from the right lane into the middle lane now there's three cars abreast doing the exact  same speed which is not safe of course it's not they're all like bunched together get the van i'm  saying could have stayed exactly where he was and done the exact speed he wasn't doing this to go  faster they're in cahoots he was doing it to fuck me over you're right they were boxing you in they saw me  come in and said let's fuck this guy up that's a colombian mafia trick  all right peter yeah enjoy your safety all right that's right yeah let's go to james in chicago 
[02:32:30]  i hope peter's driving 55 and the tumor that he doesn't know he has just shuts off  james what's up i love texts from the cops thank you sir anthony does when i if i have to come to a  stop on the highway i immediately say there better be someone dead right now there better be a  helicopter in the middle of the highway if i gotta stop somebody should be bleeding to death right now 
[02:33:00]  yes you're not alone with that yes that's a that's a big deal i think very good all right hey we got  to get uh amy fisher's husband in here i didn't reckon i walked in i'm like he's he's kind of a he's  like a fucking like a long island tough guy yeah he's just standing there i'm like who is this guy  and then as soon as i sat down strong handshake oh did i didn't i didn't oh yeah you didn't no  probably slap from the island you know hey sir yes there he is taking a strong what's up man how  you doing hello what's up buddy what's happening beat me up i just walked in wow i thought i could 
[02:33:30]  sneak one in i didn't know you heard that yeah this guy's from the lee marvin generation  we got a nice and everything lou is a fucking big dude he literally could kick all our asses  yeah just lou we ain't fucking with you lou is a problem lou you are a problem it was a fucking  problem you can tell right off the bat lou is a problem lou's the guy that starts off clapping  you on the back and 11 beers later he's fucking mashing your teeth into a curb  that's funny is that natural or steroids let's get right to it here 
[02:34:00]  well i don't believe in steroids i believe you have to win the um the uh war and not the battle  yeah in other words you have to lift and stay in shape to uh stay in shape for the rest of your life  you know uh implants no no bicep implants i haven't done a push-up in about 25 years i'll tell you what  i was lifting very heavy weights for a long time and then recently i injured my shoulder so as a  consequence of that i had to do uh high rep exercises and i lost about 20 pounds 
[02:34:30]  so rather than walking around like a tank all day long i rather walk around more fit feeling better  so i learned a lesson you're better off lifting high reps lighter weight and you'll feel a lot  better this is of course amy fisher's uh husband uh lou who's uh in the porno with her and we uh we  talked about the other day and uh god i hope you didn't hear that show man but we actually now  that i see you live he's gonna throw us a beating amy looks great i mean it was nothing about yeah 
[02:35:00]  it was uh fucking hot the dialogue was yeah amy does look look really good yeah and uh we were  commenting on um well the one thing i guess we commented on how many takes did you do during  that uh scene well you know you know a lot of people think that this was stage it wasn't it was  just for our own personal enjoyment yeah it's kind of film like every other porno out there though  it really looks like no that wasn't meant to be released as a porno although did you kind of in  the back of your head think well maybe because it kind of looks like it doesn't it doesn't have 
[02:35:30]  the appearance of like uh a uh paris hilton's you know well let me say one turn the camera on and  let's fuck let me say one thing about those other videos those people plan the videos to be released  in some clandestine way yeah so they uh their objective was was to create the uh perpetrator  their objective was was to make believe that they were you know they didn't know anything  about it and they would have filmed this tape and released it and in my particular case in  our particular case this was strictly you know home video enjoyment he sounds like a cop after 
[02:36:00]  they overly beat the shit out of someone i was a cop i was a cop there you go this incident  the uh person in question well unfortunately you know i'm out of the force like 20 years but  still come off how long are we on for i was on for 12 years okay nice uh-oh what kind of work  since then what does that mean i've been an event video producer for 25 years were you one of those  rogue cops no it was just called being a cop back then by the way this isn't an episode of the wire 
[02:36:30]  there are maybe real rogue cops before any everybody had those goddamn camera phones it was just  being called being a cop he was fucking danny aiello in fort apache well you know that's funny  because i was in the uh one of the few cops in the screen actors guild in those days really right  after sonny grasso and eddie yegan uh i got in the uh screen actors guild and i was in about 40 or 50  movies back in the 70s yes in the 70s that's correct anything we would know frank sinatra i uh worked 
[02:37:00]  in a couple movies with him contract on cherry street and first deadly sin charles bronson but i mean  like like describe something we would know like you remember that scene with whatever i was the  guy i basically did extra work some day player work some stunt work kojak i got shot and killed  played a detective on that show really you have dialogue you have dialogue so you did i had some  dialogue but to be honest with you that was a lousy actor so how about the rookies were you ever on  that the rookies no no i wasn't the swat mcmillan and wife vegas i never did it mcleod it's true 
[02:37:30]  mcmillan and wife he was the one i'm glad i wasn't on mcmillan and wife because i'm glad i wasn't  you know next to the rock yeah i dropped something in the uh you know yeah yeah that old school there  you go yeah especially he'd have fucked me in the ass is what he would have got does this taste  funny episode he arrested mcmillan for drilling holes in the fucking wrestling store  hardcastle mccormick that is funny people are just tuning in this is amy fisher's uh karen husband 
[02:38:00]  and i gotta say right off the bat you don't look like joey buttafuco in person i don't know why  they make that uh well they make it yeah they make it he's older than she is and he's a big guy like  this guy joey has a he's just a bigger guy and all the dude that's there's not even a comparison  when you when you see uh well i think they those two are uh compared to like a laurel and hardy or an  avid costello team so they want to get me in the mix i guess to somehow i don't think laurel ever shot 
[02:38:30]  anyone in the face except with a pie can i ask a question as a fellow long islander i gotta know  something because i bought this tape yeah and i want to know one thing who did the drywall  in the um in the stairway scene where she's on top behind it beautiful work  just give me a name and a number after he's very good you should see the finished work he came out  great i saw the beautiful home but amy's coming up the stairs in the towel i'm looking going this 
[02:39:00]  speckle uh it's just sand it's not painted yet well that we didn't intend to have this released  to the public i mean you know that we were like a room full of homos like why would they have  those drapes what is that it was strictly casual filming it was there was no intent so you guys  were filming yourselves and uh so what's the story then you guys broke up for a little bit well my  wife made a quite a few appearances on entertainment tonight i'm sure aware of that where sure she had  confrontational episodes with joey and then culminated in her uh being forgiven by mary joe right so uh 
[02:39:30]  it was a huge success on entertainment tonight it was the highly rated show they ever had  so subsequently another hollywood producer came to us i hate to use the police terminology but  subsequently i feel like i'm in a court case here i'm testifying in a traffic summons case  subsequently yeah at the time and place of a night sticks at the time and place of a current we 
[02:40:00]  are ascertained i got a 317 and uh i'm looking at a 289 well i couldn't help myself i was listening  you guys talk about the traffic violation so it's just kind of like so you you are you um hold on  yeah so another producer after the uh success of the entertainment uh appearances uh got ahold of  wanted to ride that wave into a possible reality show so affirmative he uh he put them together uh  they were chatting on the phone you know how annoyed were you as her husband though like what 
[02:40:30]  did she say to you look i kind of want to do this and you're like what the fuck are you doing i'm  married to you well you know i'm very low-key and this whole entire marriage basically and the and  the time i've been with her has been very low-key so i wasn't really prepared for this kind of uh  publicity just to to bring everyone aboard what we're talking about is uh they what we're trying  to get uh joey and amy back together and film it for a reality show yeah as if they were an item  but it was so obvious to i think to almost everybody there was no there was no there was 
[02:41:00]  nothing there well it was obviously being done for no i'm not saying that it did culminate where  they did wind up going out with one another yeah but was it really them going out yeah it was it  was but i mean the groundwork before that wasn't though so then they're rehashing old memories  and one thing went to another and obviously that didn't sit too well how jealous how angry how bad  you want to smash about if you go well with a man american lift 300 and carries a legal pistol  i think he did very well controlling himself wait we're going way too fast here though yeah because  the producer gets together he's got this idea i want you and uh joey together but yeah the big thing 
[02:41:30]  is you she's married so how does she come to you and go look lou i gotta well she didn't really come to  me i mean i found out about it i was uh my space getting no not myself i was buying i cleared up  the whole talk i was buying her some flowers for uh mother's day and then the lady next to me had a  front page headline in the new york post that they're getting together for dinner and i wasn't  informed of that and so obviously you had to find out from the front pages of yeah i did yeah because 
[02:42:00]  before that i thought it was strictly conversation taking place for the sake of a reality show oh boy and  uh obviously that didn't sit too well with me so you called her and you're like what is this  shit yeah we you know we got into it into it and uh i was upset say the least so uh i i left you  know i was living in a friend's apartment and uh you guys have two kids together right yes we do okay  well two words revenge fuck you must have went on the ultimate 
[02:42:30]  yeah you know i'll put it this way i didn't take it to the extent of oj but you know good good you know  i was more civilized about it so i i made a decision i mean i made a decision to uh get revenge on the  one hand and possibly make a business decision on the other hand because i knew that if i was going to  divorce her it was going to cost money right so here's on the one hand on the one hand i could  get back at her for what you know she did to me embarrassed me and on the other hand i could 
[02:43:00]  hopefully make a few bucks out of it to be quite frank all right and i gotta slow down again because  it's something we talk about on the show all the time now she obviously is getting uh back together  with joey at the time and now you might be heading toward a divorce case and this is how fucked up the  divorce laws we have to go down this road again you would have to end up paying for this shit  and losing a lot of a lot of money and possibly the house because she's decided to go uh well i'm  gonna wind up paying for it in any event so if i have to pay for it screw her screw him i'll make 
[02:43:30]  a few bucks and i'll take the earnings out of that and pay for it rather than my hard earned money so  you had all this uh videotape you guys obviously how many how many hours of uh uh taping did you guys  there's a lot i mean we did over a few years is there there's more years there's more wow a box set in  your future yes yes a few years of wow how did you meet amy fisher like when you first met her you  obviously knew who she was before you met her and actually i didn't i didn't oh well yeah i did know 
[02:44:00]  who she was but but believe it or not i i didn't even know who you guys were so i didn't even follow  what that's right i'm sorry i don't want to offend anyone but what happened she was in the news a  little more than us yes that's true but you met her and and when did it turn you on like you know  i'm hooking up with amy fisher like no no because i'm an event video producer and i've filmed people  from uh mickey mantle jfk jr so i've met a lot of celebrities so-called celebrities in my life so that  didn't impress me i went on a blind date that's how we got her i went on something right now you don't 
[02:44:30]  impress me it didn't impress me she was hot looking she's hot she had a great bod and i was  divorced and i want to have a good time basically so i wouldn't care if she was whoa whoa whoa you  went on a blind date with amy fisher well it was a result of a uh aolmatch.com who drove you robert  chambers that's uh wait she was she was on she was on uh aol looking no i was i used that you know at  at the time i was about 49 years old i was still doing the nightclub scene although i didn't like 
[02:45:00]  to do that so aol was a good vehicle to meet people back in those days i don't know how it is  today but she she had to have been on it to have seen what she did was she she didn't like dating  that much you know the guys you know whatever so she saw my so-called ad on this uh internet  match.com she liked the way i looked she liked what i had to say and she contacted me via email  and we had a blind date did she didn't tell you i'm amy fisher she just no no no she's a 
[02:45:30]  different name and you really didn't know she shows up and then i showed up late she was waiting  in the car she said look if you would show up five minutes late i was getting ready to leave but when  i saw you or shoot somebody oh jesus sorry so when i saw you she said i i you know you you attractive  you know and uh she was glad we met we had dinner at bocce's famous restaurant here on long  island did you know right off the bat like no i didn't see i would have looked at her and gone  holy shit jamie fisher i wouldn't have driven away what did she eat but you know what let me let 
[02:46:00]  me just say what i'll say a thing in her defense what she did years ago was a reckless idiotic act  i mean not to minimize it yeah but she did her time definitely and the lady that i know today is  quite different i mean you know as i know she she worked at the long island press she's a good  mother takes very good care about children but haven't you ever gotten into an argument with  her and at one point in the back of your head like this no shot somebody no you know what is  that where the police training comes in you know what i mean it's funny but but in a way i i don't 
[02:46:30]  fear anyone i don't fear whether horror or six foot eight five hundred pound guy i'm not that's not  my makeup you know so i just said black i mean really you're talking about who's this swede out  there that we don't know i don't fear i don't fear a seven foot nordic gentleman nordic gentleman who  throws down a rhyme or two are you talking about vikings in other words what i'm trying to say is i 
[02:47:00]  treat people one-on-one if they treat me good i treat them good and and i act accordingly so how did  the past come up you guys start dating and then no what happened was is that she liked me and we  were conversing very well we got along very well and she said you know what let me tell this guy  who i am right away was this way i give him the opportunity to move on right away or because i  like him you know let me let him know right away who i am and then if he doesn't bother him we can  continue on the relationship so when she said i'm amy fisher did you go oh that's the girl shot the 
[02:47:30]  person in the face or did she have to then explain no no i knew who she was when she told me who  she was but i was more interested in the uh chicken dish in the parmesan and everything else  it didn't really faze me you were the coolest guy in the world did you have a drop gun in the bathroom  like in the godfather excuse me amy watch your hands drop it to the floor don't look eye contact  don't look away by the way by the way that is one of my favorite movies and my wife has not seen it 
[02:48:00]  to this day what i'm trying to it's not a chick's movie it's not a chick's movie i told you got to  see this movie my girlfriend watched it and she got bored during the wedding scene i wanted to  strangle her how do you fucking not like the wedding scene the godfather yeah of course hey let me  you uh one thing like you're older than amy this is how much of an age difference is there  between you two um i just turned 57 i don't know how old amy is she's 33 oh wow she's great huh  young girl yeah absolutely you kidding me there was a sexy moment in the tape where uh she said  something about like daddy she said something like that oh yeah that's kind of fun i was like 
[02:48:30]  that phone and you said like your little girl's pussy to me i said i bet you that's how like that's  what their real sex is like but they had to edit that out so it didn't have that the funny thing is  when i met with the uh the distributor and they saw the footage uh they said hey we got to make  this into like a guide to uh proper marital relations so they they they were impressed by it they you  know they they liked the way everything flowed and the way we were uh you know the way we got  how pissed is your ex-wife that you're hooked up with such a hottie now okay what was that how 
[02:49:00]  how pissed is my wife what your ex-wife now my ex-wife oh no i've heard i've been way to blow it  14 years so how do you feel about parafuco have you met him i did meet him i mean i met him on the  shows and uh you know i could you take him you think absolutely i matter of fact i wanted to  challenge him to that celebrity boxing i was supposed to fight him on that celebrity boxing but he backed 
[02:49:30]  down but how about like a stomped down you know what i'm talking about like a real like you know  oh hey i can't believe you're here actually we we did have we did if you saw if you saw the  entertainment tonight episodes i did have a verbal confrontation with him when he was you know when  he was getting on my wife my wife wanted to come clean they wanted to have an apology you know  take responsibility for the actions that's the way it was supposed to go and then he came on and  blindsided or attacked her that's where i stepped in and i confronted him well being from long 
[02:50:00]  island i have to tell you it's either cop or mechanic  was that uh was that shot at your house that was that was in my home yeah wow yeah because um  i would never say where but uh you live probably a couple of doors down from my mother and uh  south shore and south yeah yeah but somewhere on the island yeah in the same uh community there 
[02:50:30]  so uh i passed your house a couple of weekends i don't think you did it's a gated community  yeah oh no i passed it because i'm allowed in oh yeah they allow you in i'm gonna find it  my mother lives there i want a refund on my my mother lives in the same community  it's all the rage she's like you know amy fisher lives down the street i'm like really yeah you  missed what he was saying his mom yeah my mom lives there what is very funny is her and i can go  out i mean there's no problem nobody approaches us it's beautiful but when she goes out by herself 
[02:51:00]  forget it yeah well you then they're not gonna you know they're not gonna bust balls that's for sure  one of those meaty fists in the face i don't think he just looks like he's a hard fast man  he was a fucking he's a major fucking problem he's like one of those guys you have to hit with a piano  i didn't think i was gonna have so much fun  piano oh he's a fucking you can you can hit him as hard as you want you just do this  and then you know you're just fucked that fucking haircut 
[02:51:30]  yeah you got so anyway you know i'm caught between a rock and a hard place now because  uh we created this tape i didn't expect to be a porn star at 57 years old my wife obviously  didn't sign off on it she was upset about it but what happened was it hit number one  on the uh avn shots it's in my house i have it i love it i hope you paid for it i did i actually  did yes we screened it yeah let's uh we're doing pretty uh pretty well here so um you're you guys 
[02:52:00]  are separated you got this footage you call red light district right right and uh all right so now  they're gonna send this porn out and then obviously you and amy got back together how long after that  it was about a month and now you have to tell her what you did well i tried to uh to stall it off  with the distributor i mean they created this site i tried hey look fellas it was a it was a decision  i regret well when you realized you were getting back uh together with amy there's nothing i could 
[02:52:30]  do you must have been thinking in your head like oh fuck how do i tell you this well you know what  you don't see this on according to jim that's for sure how do you handle it you know hey in a moment  of heated passion you know you might but i want to know i guess what i'm saying is i want to know  how that conversation kind of went how do you break the ice and go uh i uh i got something to tell you  you know uh i had bought up the uh the uh website amy fisher.com and what i did was made an official  site for her which you really had no interest in but i just wanted to buy the domain name anyway 
[02:53:00]  so as part of the deal they took over that site and they created the site for the uh you know by  the tape and all the legal work was done so obviously when i told her i mean what am i going to do it's  going to come out i had to let her know about it she almost hit the floor so but uh i have no regrets  looking backwards at the time i i felt i was justified in what i was doing even though it was an  emotional decision and uh lou what they asked you what is the i'm always wondering about this 
[02:53:30]  what's the legality of that like if you film i mean i know it's your wife and you're in it but  like is is there a way like because people always wonder about pam and and anderson and tommy like  what's what's the legal thing she could have done to stop it if she wanted to well she is trying to  stop it right now but what's been happening is that uh the response to it has been so overwhelming  uh from what i've told it's like 25 times the amount of tapes sold in the first two weeks than  anybody it's number one out of 50 on the top 50 at the avian site i'll give you an example kim 
[02:54:00]  kardashian's tape is not even in the top 50 that's right which by the way is that ray j  so so so so obviously she's resigned to the fact that it's out there even though uh we she had  contacted kim's tape they're starting to say that she released her own tape you know like you were  saying earlier a lot of these so so many sex tapes that the people involved are actually you know  well let me say in addition to that she's been getting a lot of calls for lingerie products and  other uh spin-offs from that she's getting swamped with that and to do talk shows and some everything 
[02:54:30]  else so she's right she resigned to the fact that it was done and you probably have to make the best  of it at this juncture i don't know if legally we can do anything get out of it you spanked pretty  well too i was watching uh lou mr spanking yeah he's got fucking just sounds spanking yeah i was  going i was going very mild i have to spank all those years of girls hands very much like jake  lamont i have little girls i have to spank like like like that but he was doing this come over 
[02:55:00]  here bend over i'll give you a demonstration i was like what a big fucking those are good spanking  hands just right fucking in every room you know we're going this room where were the kids  that by the pool the kids were at school or they weren't in the house this was an afternoon  fuck yeah it was yeah it was pretty much broad daylight long we noticed the light filter  changed a few times too during some of the scenes like all of a sudden you guys were in sepia  yeah that was a dream that really happened well let me put it this way i'm gonna vet video 
[02:55:30]  produce it if i wanted to really make a video uh you know and plan this thing i would have a  lighting crew in i would have had cameramen in it was a little sprite change i mean i didn't even  give a shit about uh white balancing or whatever it was just done for our own yeah  our own fun so i mean that's why some of the scenes that look out of out of white balance  lou does it i was funny too there's one scene we were laughing because you look like you were skydiving  you're having all that was it was actually a really good fuck scene because it was just like it just  looked like raw fucking it was hot which one was this she's on her back and you're like laying on 
[02:56:00]  top but you had your your left leg one leg was off like you were skydiving which i could never do  my fucking bag would tighten up and my leg would cramp but your leg was off in the air i'm like  pretty acrobatic well let me give you a little insight on this this was very difficult to to do  this because uh we're having fun we're enjoying ourselves but we don't have the uh uh the benefit  of a independent film crew who could walk around get certain angles and so on and so forth so  when we wanted to make these tapes of ourselves for our own private enjoyment you had a tripod and you 
[02:56:30]  had to be unmarked you had to look up at the camera so it was very it was very awkward so a lot of  the scenes like in the very beginning that beginning scene where you see me almost like  straight you know straightening up i'm basically the viewer doesn't know it i'm just looking at a  truck at a uh monitor to just make sure i'm on mark and i look good you know what i'm saying  we went it looks very stiff some of the scenes yeah because there was no reaction  emotionally in your face or anything to you coming it was you shot it the first load you shoot in this 
[02:57:00]  video you're pretty much straight face gone yeah i'm shooting alone it was like watching it was  like watching superman get blown yeah you're just like man the reason for that again is because i was  more concerned about you know being on camera guys to uh you know my head's chopped off it's not the  kind of guy you are somebody's six foot eight you know it just doesn't scare you first load it's no  big deal that's right i think we should do this in 24 frames you know what i like is that whenever 
[02:57:30]  you talk about it it's more of a movie feel you just cut this poor guy off sorry sir i'm sorry no i  do it in the comedy clubs to him all the time  is that like when you talk about it because you're a gentleman you're from a different generation now like  us us you know trash over here you're like we're enjoying ourselves having a good time you know  like when old people talk about that they'll like it's i was in my mind like hold on let me get my  walk around no no no older people they they never say sex it's always like we were enjoying ourselves 
[02:58:00]  we had a good time my mom talks that way and i could always see her like being tea bagged in the back of  like a model t or something we enjoyed ourselves we of course you know showed affection  there's no detail yeah black dick in her mouth  yeah it's like two in the air you know the fucking forbidden fruit  listen i have overalls open no that's class that's what i'm saying i didn't need to bring  it up generationally i didn't drive up here in a model t by the way you know i could get down 
[02:58:30]  and dirty too but when i discuss my obviously exactly we did things that people do who are in love  yeah four on the floor airtight i found a fucking condom in my parents house i was living with my  parents i was 15 i found a floating rubber in the tub wow why don't you just stick it in her ass so i  know how old are your kids uh six and two do they get any well i guess the six-year-old does he get 
[02:59:00]  any shit about no mom's past you know we live a regular mundane life believe it or not and we treat  our kids uh the highest priority make sure they have the best things in life and we love them very  much by the way i i got it back yeah but i've heard uh that exact thing uh over the years when  it comes to amy and and her mothering skills and all that we go to school meetings and we were right  on top of homework and stuff like that she's really a great mother i mean and uh you know this is a 
[02:59:30]  people people have the really wrong impression or like who she really is i mean this so-called  stage persona and then the real person behind the uh you know what she is it's like jim  the real guy she's just a down-earth regular ordinary type of type of girl is her mom still  alive sure is does she uh approve of the relationship oh absolutely yeah yeah has she  ever gone into let me just cut you off on a relationship marriage relationship marriage it 
[03:00:00]  depends upon how people treat one another yeah and how they understand and communicate one another  age is really irrelevant if you take care of yourself physically and uh and the two of you get  along you have things in common those that's the groundwork for good marriage as opposed to being  close in age that really you know doesn't really mean anything it's how you communicate you don't  have to explain that to myself or anthony so let's all hug the two of you are married yeah me and me and 
[03:00:30]  that's it sound a little weird you don't have to explain that to me and anthony we've been going  out now for quite a while let's cut up that pecan pie  so you're both getting along good yeah but now that people see you in porn don't like girls  like they see in a club or whatever don't they like want to like you know well actually you know  kind of proving yourself right i don't i don't go to clubs and every everywhere i goes with my wife  and it can happen anywhere though like you know yeah but you know when that was shot i had longer 
[03:01:00]  hair i got the military buzz cut so you know i wear a yankee cap all the time so a lot of people  don't even know you know who i am and then it's it's fine with me so you whip out that cock online  and show them i walked around with my johnson stick it out then everybody see there you go my johnson  yeah my howdy day what do you call it today what do you call it today am i a cock  we've always called he's probably not used to i'm being on the radio and being that dirt either  because you know most of all we can say anything here on the satellite yeah hey can we get amy on 
[03:01:30]  the phone i think uh she's taking my son today you know he just uh you know was that was the  excuse you guys worked out no no no believe it or not he had he had surgery he had my surgery done  and he just got out yesterday and it's where we were yesterday so tomorrow would be a better time  to talk did you ever uh go in depth with talking to her about uh the whole episode of her shooting uh  you know what i never really get into that with her when she uh confides in me anything that she 
[03:02:00]  wants to confide in me it's between us and special relationships i don't press her i don't  i was just wondering if she ever did you know i don't press her on that she does confide in me  from time to time but i allow her space to do it when she ever wants to do it you know  one of those dumb kid things you do how come kids always find guns but they never find like the sex  well look what happened in this mall what did this mommy i mean look what happened in the mall that 
[03:02:30]  just recently took place so you don't know what happens in some child's or some kid's mind to make  them do something stupid like that when's the last time you belted somebody oh probably when i was on  the police force oh really yeah a while ago do you miss in the old days well actually i liked it a lot  when i was young when i was a kid it was very exciting i couldn't wait to uh go to work i didn't  want to go home but it cracks some skulls against the press you know believe it i have a lot of  respect for police officers especially those who work in uh high crime what force were you on i was 
[03:03:00]  in uh i worked in brooklyn oh yeah and some of the toughest neighborhoods that's fine what deck  what decade it was a decade when lincoln was elected i was saying 77 must have just been some  of the worst times ever denaro taxi driver yeah yeah the crack epidemic well i'll tell you something i  came on right after serpico but i'll tell you there's one movie uh dog day afternoon yeah which  i was actually on that actual site that uh that occurred and the picture depicted the events totally 
[03:03:30]  total fabrication because the police at the scene at that time were very cool and level-headed  and they allowed the perpetrators to be escorted out of the building and where one of them was  subsequently and there's that word again shot on the way sal to the airport yeah but the police  handle had a very professional manner and they were very cool and laid back and what they did but  the picture uh portrayed them as like a bunch of bumbling idiots so did you have a black partner 
[03:04:00]  who was too old for things actually i had i had i actually i had the greatest partner that any any uh man  could ever want for a party he was a great guy he passed away from cancer uh about six seven years ago  but he was terrific in that he wasn't big they was rocky i loved him a lot he was right by my side  anytime uh any situation always count on him and he was a great great police officer and uh sorely missed 
[03:04:30]  as a as a friend hey did you get that coat when you did uh kojak actually that's an abercrombian  fit hey there you go yeah my wife my wife got me involved in abercrombian fit so she's keeping me up to date  that's a good part about being married to a younger woman in that you have no you have no uh reason to  get old i have young kids i have a young wife we do a lot of things together it keeps me young  and uh that's a that's a plus in a so-called younger woman you get to feel a nice smooth ass 
[03:05:00]  let me tell you that goes a long way with me  i couldn't be with a 50 60 year old woman never forget it you know what uh i want to know what  lou finds funny because we've been cracking jokes for the last hour and we can barely get him smiling  i know the listeners are enjoying it what what do you find funny lou well i have you have to look at  life in a in a humorous way you can't take everything too serious i don't know whether 
[03:05:30]  i'm quoting freud or my new account or whatever but you know you gotta be you know you gotta treat  people respect you can't be on edge you gotta enjoy life and enjoy conversations shimba's list  shimba's list absolutely well cops usually have the best sense of humor because they've seen so  much crazy stuff that you know like they just gotta like laugh at it or drink it out that's funny  because you talk about my references in police terminology when i talk about things and uh  when i was a police officer for 12 years it's never changed even though it's 30 years ago whatever it 
[03:06:00]  is i still feel i can get into a car today and do the job so i'm thankful for that experience it also  gives you a chance to view people in many different situations and understand different walks of life  so it was a very very good opportunity a lot of stuff underneath that statement while profiling yeah  you know what you know what there's nothing wrong with profiling exactly nothing wrong with it all  it's too much political correctness and and law enforcement today which is wrong uh in everything  actually low what got you off the force 12 years you didn't retire well i could have vested at 15 
[03:06:30]  years and what happened was i uh formed my own entertainment company and i was doing i was one of the  first mobile djs at the time and i was moonlighting doing that i was doing big gigs at the hilton and the  hamptons and then i instead of schlepping this equipment around i got into the video business  because i was hiring video people as subcontractors and i said hey this is easy  so i self-taught myself how to film and edit and hooked up with a major studio in manhattan 
[03:07:00]  and i was with them for like 22 years and then also i have my own clientele on my own  and thank god i've been very successful so i had a choice to make back in uh i think it was 82  whether to go from 29 000 a year and a pension or to go to 250 000 a year where'd you decide  i think i made the same decision i said my career in reverse  four years ago making half quarter of a mil now look at me so  like in that jacket 
[03:07:30]  and also at the time at the time that i made that decision the police force wasn't as attractive as  it once was because it was quite frankly very depressing after a while when you work in high  hazard areas it does become very depressing do you remember when freaking frank lucas got busted  what you're working in frank lucas uh that was probably something the squad the detective squad  handled yeah i think it was a major narcotics what is he a major narcotics oh yeah yeah yeah  yeah that's something that the average street cop was uh wasn't involved with 
[03:08:00]  yeah i heard that that that they took a lot of liberty with that uh that story is that true  again i was uh on patrol so i handled the every mundane task of uh  beatings handled the beatings handled the back alleys  then that suck you didn't have the tasers back then no you know what we had uh you know look  i'm off for a long time i'll give you a fun story um see this is what he finds funny here we go 
[03:08:30]  i'll give you one of my war stories which you can't do today but i was a rookie and i went with a  you know a seasoned cop to a uh a family dispute some kind of dispute it was a downtown brooklyn  seven eight precinct which was a very very violent precinct at that time most of the gun runs were  founded when we locked up indian construction workers you couldn't even get the cuffs on their wrist  so it was a very violent precinct but i liked it i was 21 i couldn't wait to do it so we went on a  dispute and i go in there in the apartment and i see this lady saying officer i want this man removed 
[03:09:00]  from my house and i look over and i see this big muscular chinese person from that that was a mandarin accent  i said i said what's your name said my name is we fuck i'm young so anyway a very menacing figure and  i i asked the lady i said who's paying the rent he said i paid the rent so i motioned over to him i was  in good shape i had my arms crossed like mr clean and i pointed him i said you have to leave 
[03:09:30]  so uh he gets out of his seat and he comes over to me face to face he crosses his arm he says i ain't  leaving i said listen i'm telling you one time you have to leave he said i ain't leaving so i reach  in my back pocket i had a big slap a big lead slapper the sap that's what kenny talks about  and one motion brought across his head opened up his head the guy went flying back on the couch  i walk over to him with a napkin i start you know absorbing the blood off his head and i said are you 
[03:10:00]  gonna leave now he said yes sir officer i'm leaving right away now you can't do that anymore no  kenny gave me one of those slappers man i i don't know where it's like a hard leather  because the jacks would put a hole in somebody's head a slapper you you couldn't see you couldn't  see the consequence he was he was disrespecting the lady so it was good that you did a good  disrespect me also yeah in other words i treated people fairly yes and decently and if i'm telling 
[03:10:30]  you to leave and it's a high hazard violent precinct and i'm saying please leave and the man's saying  i'm not going to leave what are you going to do about it then did your heart rate go up at all  no  i i my heart rate my heart rate did not get up i'll tell you another one where we went in the  when i was in the 90th precinct i'm thinking of the movie montage the clock is just circling  so i cracked his head it's 11 o'clock if you would put the cop talk over the porn this would be like 
[03:11:00]  a double-edged sword of guys want this you know cracking him in the head where's that code  i'll give you an example how we could use restraint i went on a run years ago in williamsburg and when  we got there a guy was laying in the street stabbed to death and the people were telling us that the  perpetrator was on the top floor so my partner rocky and i went to the top floor kicked down the door and  there the guy was standing with a knife so we i could have shot him right on the spot but we 
[03:11:30]  didn't uh rocky distracted him and i got the knife out of his hand we locked him up and we gave him  over to detectives but you know we do use we i did use restraint how did you distract him hey look at  that he took out his cock all right i said it i did it did you ever have to uh shoot anybody uh thankfully  no oh thankfully well sometimes thanks did you ever just wave it around just to no brandish brandish 
[03:12:00]  your weapon were you there during the blackout during the yes okay that must have been a wild  crazy wild west in new york it was crazy right yeah that was around 78 i think yeah yeah that was  wild i think the most uh scariest situation i went on is when we uh we had to face a big mom big  bomb riot we're throwing bottles and rocks at us more vikings oh jews oh the virus  no this was uh this was a latin virus 
[03:12:30]  you did your time didn't you this was a latin area of uh for grand avenue i don't know if you ever  heard of grand avenue in williamsburg this is a big latin section wow responded to a disturbance and  where were you during the uh crazy eddie bust you know you know that's funny because those are the  customers that that i uh catered to today yeah oh really what about this here around get get back  to grand uh avenue or whatever i'm just saying you you can go uh on one hand uh rescuing somebody or 
[03:13:00]  saving somebody's life and then on the other hand you have bottles thrown at you i mean one time on a  late tour uh we were coming out of a job and somebody threw a brick from god knows where and  it crashed into the back of our windshield just missing our heads so it was a very exciting type  of job you can one minute face violence one minute helping somebody one minute solving a dispute so  well you must have been on there during uh son of sam also right actually i was uh yes i knew the 
[03:13:30]  detective uh who uh handled that case but again that was not a matter for patrol yeah but they told  told you to keep your eyes open i'm sure absolutely yeah you see a cock blocker lurking  the ultimate they told us to keep our eyes open and i'll fly zip it okay so you don't want that  cock hanging out you're comfortable around violence like you seem like a guy who's not uh  not one to shy away from it i'll put it in a bad way either i'll put it this way i'll put it this 
[03:14:00]  way uh with my sicilian background so to say i could i could treat somebody with respect and have a  nice conversation and if somebody attacks me or is violent toward me i'm going to come at him the same  way so please do not come to the comedy cellar no i don't think i can take him yeah you know what you  would be blaming the table behind him here would be funny lionel remember lionel yes he's great  excuse me line on the radio dude yes yeah i heard some of his tapes uh some of his uh comedies he's 
[03:14:30]  great yeah he was uh he's one of the first guys to ever have me on television although my favorite  comedian is jackie mason by that show my age jackie mason he's good really oh he is i got two different  pictures with jackie mason and both times he's looking the wrong way well i'll tell you i'll tell you one  thing like the greatest experience i've ever had two experiences two celebrities who i idolized and  i don't really care about celebrities they could was one was mickey mantle wow and the other one was  frank sinatra so when i was able to work in motion pictures i worked with frank on contract on sherry 
[03:15:00]  street and took a picture of him and i and two years later i saw him on the set of first deadly sin  so i took the picture over to sinatra and i said mr sinatra i worked with you on uh contract on  cherry street would you mind signing this he was very gracious and signed the uh the autograph he  said what's your name i said lou he said for lou frank sinatra and i still have that to to this day so  that's a cherished memory and i also had the privilege of filming mantle in his restaurant with  vice president quail which was great because i was hired by some congressman to film the two of 
[03:15:30]  them the three of them together so quail comes into mantle's restaurant and it's it's like santa claus  he mickey he like he was looking at jesus or something like quail was like that uh quail yeah  he looked at mantle like it was god so mantle was very stern and then this guy who hired me was like  hiding in the corner so i told him i said come on come in the picture i says you know everybody smile  and look at the camera and say yankees and mantle goes yankees and he cracks up and it was great just 
[03:16:00]  filming mantle talking to quail about his career and why he quit and then all of a sudden he he brings  quail over to another guest who was sitting in the restaurant it was rocky blyer the pittsburgh  steelers so those are the two highlights i filmed a lot of people over the years from liza minnelli to  was it before the botox liza we saw her yesterday on television she looks  fucking hard yeah you know what this was believe it or not  believe it or not what this was was some very wealthy dude hired her for his 11th wedding 
[03:16:30]  anniversary at the hotel pierre he must have paid her about a hundred grand or so just to sing for 10  minutes so was mickey mantle didn't seem like mickey didn't seem like he'd be impressed with anybody  no he wasn't he was looked a little annoyed at first but then he he kind of warmed up  the quail that's fucking hilarious the vice president just irritated  what he did was before i went over to mantles he was talking about the gulf war and when he sat down  at the news conference which i was filming he said my kids could care less wow what i do every day but  i'm gonna go see mickey mantle today and they want a full report so when i heard that in my mind mickey 
[03:17:00]  mantles oh this is fantastic so i got an opportunity to uh to film mantle you should  have did you talk to him at all i didn't really want to impose i was there as a uh a producer so  i didn't really want to get involved with that you know i would have imposed i would have sat on his  lap got a fucking photo yeah i want i have one question like uh when you were a police officer  what the gun that you carried was what 38 revolver right but uh and the gun they carry now the nine 
[03:17:30]  right yeah that's that's the problem with these semi-automatic guns is that people say jesus this  cop shot this guy four times what happens what happens is is that they react to a dangerous  situation they perceive they're going to be attacked and when they put pressure on this uh on this gun  it's not like an old revolver where you go one one one you know you put pressure in like 20 rounds come  out so you have three guys shooting it's like why did you shoot this guy with 100 rounds when in reality  all it was was guys putting pressure and the rounds are flowing out much faster than it was 
[03:18:00]  the old days you shoot bang bang bang bang so if you shoot bang bang and the guy goes down you stop  but on the other hand if you're pulling that that squeezing that trigger and 10 rounds come out all  at once from three different angles in the next day it's the papers that the cops filled this guy with  40 rounds and that's right it's not i think while you're assessing the damage that you've done to the  guy you're still shooting because you can you know you have a big enough magazine and you have a  a semi-automatic so you're you're shooting you're in that situation where you don't know it's life or 
[03:18:30]  death so you're assessing his health at the time is he down is he going down am i hitting him but as  you're doing that you're still shooting at the big target i don't think anyone in this room wants to die  and if you go on a situation where it's a dangerous situation that's usually what you hear before  someone dies i don't think any of you want to die so here's a proposition for you i'm going to make 
[03:19:00]  you an offer right here it is that was delivered perfectly what i'm alluding what i'm alluding to  is that is that nobody wants to die and if you're in a situation where it's life and death and you get  a description of a of a so-called perpetrator and he looks like this perpetrator he's acting in a  suspicious way you go to approach him gun's drawn and you say hey put that down or don't do  and he reaches in to get a pack of cigarettes you don't know that he's reaching for a pack of  cigarettes and if you repeatedly say stop halt and he keeps going on with that move that's a  dumb ass move it is a dumb ass move oh that's where your black partner would go it ain't worth it 
[03:19:30]  player but unfortunately unfortunately the sharpens of the world have to make political  hay out of this and take advantage of it and and unfortunately the police have to suffer  there's a consequence wow well how can you ask your question how come they never say that like in the  trial like they never seem like that side of the story comes out where you talk like no one's ever  explained the the the nine millimeter the way you just explained it so it actually makes sense 
[03:20:00]  well the other side of the argument i'm sure the police commissioner and the police department's  aware they conduct investigations via iad but the sharpens of the world would never come out  and say hey you know it was justified right because it you know just uh it ruins their uh  view of who they're supposed to be you know if they played it fairly they would say oh this guy was  wrong he was locked up he went to jail or this guy is innocent and we apologize or we came to the wrong 
[03:20:30]  conclusion it's just not in his benefit to come out and admit there was a mistake made on his part  what can i do for my abs back to the porn i was watching like like you have  fucking your abs really show and i i have trouble knocking off this well extra weight  the way you work the abs you got to be dedicated to you have to you have to make that  he's like our father this guy really is i'm gonna be your father he's a renaissance man he's a cop 
[03:21:00]  he's a great guy at night what does that mean i'm gonna tell i'm gonna tell all you guys and all  you listeners out there have a good abs you got to look at the abs is like a baseball team  the way a pitcher is you build your foundation around your pitching staff all right so i need  a dominican on my stuff again a lot of building a lot of bodybuilders only concentrate on arms  they want a big chest big arms but they you look at them they got tiny stick legs or a big belly  stick any brand so i i think bodybuilding should be renamed body sculpting i think you're better off 
[03:21:30]  if you concentrate on the abs and then move outward to arms back chest and so on and so forth and do it  in a way which the body is supported in a healthy way you don't over build joints or muscles you you  build the body in a streamlined way it gives you more mobility and you use the abs as a starting point  and how many sit-ups a day do you do i don't do sit-ups i do all various types of machines  you know and i use those machines in conjunction with smith machines and other types of machines  to work on the abs i do but diet is slapstick yeah you can't you can't eat like crap no you really 
[03:22:00]  can't you could have great abs underneath a bunch of fat yeah the biggest killer of them all is bread  why is that because it uh it stores in the body the caveman had a a mechanism in the body  where they didn't know when they would eat so they would store the body would store uh carbs and  turn it into uh fat and uh that's what happens to this day people sit on it behinds all day they 
[03:22:30]  they're not active and when you eat a lot of bread it gets stored in the body so what don't eat as much  bread uh try to lay off the pasta and don't overeat when you're full stop eating see i actually eat  until i'm shitting while i'm swallowing swallow log push swallow log push time to stop but when you  were when you were on the force were you like drinking and smoking and like living the life you  know well young you know young cop out there you know there was two types of cops when i was on a 
[03:23:00]  job there was the married guys who needed the money for overtime right and then there was the cops who  did their job but they didn't really need the you know the blood money we used to call it we used to  make an arrest on a four to twelve shift and then spend all day in court and go back to work the  next day where you had no sleep so we used to give a lot of our so-called collars to those type guys  and we'd administer the type of justice that we had to do and also make our share of arrest but we're  more of so-called ladies men right you know so i would i think i i was in that second category but 
[03:23:30]  the drinking and smoking i only did at nightclubs i never drank and smoked during the week i always  took care of myself and i always did things in moderation that's just out there will you  rack and head and fucking that's that's what eats boogie nights that's his movie right there  were you also like the kind of cop that's like i'm also on the uh uh police benevolence to teach  the kids how to box team like that's always like a cop's cop down at the y no no that gray on  grace judo is the way to go forget crack well chest rockwell yeah we got to take a break so lou are we uh

[03:32:00]  showing lots of interest in this project are they sure they are where does this guy live right  why don't you come in here and uh show us your little invention yeah drop a j-dam into his house  just blow him up hey i want to know what happened hey what happened yeah cia is very interested yeah  well this is 1998 oh yeah where are we at where is this guy now where's he at where's the water  power car he's in guantanamo i'm not a i'm not a terrorist i swear we gotta start 
[03:32:30]  i swear to god i'll never invent anything ever again oh god not another  i'll play an escalade just let me out of here let me leave with all my fingers god  i never said i had a problem with oil it was just a hobby water's for drinking water's just for  drinking what are you gonna do with that power slot oh god he has to write a thousand times 
[03:33:00]  water's for drinking gas is for driving water's for drinking gas is for driving what is that torture  with the wet boarding what do they call it oh yeah waterboarding is this what you want to put in your  car it is it works real good doesn't it they pull him out of the drum you imagine if they did that  in gas oh oh you imagine getting soaked in gas that would be horrible horrible and horrific  if they kept your eyes open with fucking things oh that would sting i bet that would sting sting 
[03:33:30]  that would sting all right hey let's uh we got to start over because i don't know how to work  these cd players what happened if you got jerked off with gas oh this is a great contest like who  could hold out the oh all right new contest that we can't do oh yeah we'll get a bunch of people  they have to jerk off with nothing but gasoline how the fuck would that hurt what do you get  you the the pain or the fumes i mean there's a whole i think the fucking pain because gas would

[03:35:00]  the latest invention the top our news here at six o'clock an age-old dream becoming a reality a  local inventor has discovered a way hear this to use water jumping a reality sure it is well the future  says try again let me drink some of my petroleum for the way home that newscaster was some of my fuel  here in the future we say uh no it didn't happen on your car it's a major breakthrough that will no 
[03:35:30]  doubt make motorists happy and as ralph robinson explains the pentagon is also showing lots of  interest in this project water has always been considered a precious commodity but stan  myers invention may make it even more valuable late he has developed what's called a water fuel  cell it has taken the place of his old gas tank i was right behind you you got it oh oh then he's  got some news i guarantee he's dead he died in a car accident and it's something a heart attack  car accident wait wait daddy you have the answer yeah all right hold on let's try let's try hold 
[03:36:00]  on this guy is so dead it's not even funny so dead so fucking dead not even just dead he's so dead  okay someone bought the patent nothing ever happened and he had a heart attack i'm gonna say that  something weird in his past suddenly came up they don't need to kill you anymore i'm gonna say a knife  fight in a bar no i i think that stan he was fucking uh let me think this he disappeared  no it's gotta be a car crash it just has to be like they cut his brake lines he fell down the stairs 
[03:36:30]  and his family wondered why he had handcuffs on his hands and feet they did the kiddie porn thing to  him they switched his hard drive that's what they did a character assassination that's what they usually  go with two inventors died in prison uh danny what do we got on stand well uh mr meyer was mysteriously  poisoned holy shit no he wasn't and the poison uh caused an aneurysm in his brain and he died  leaving a restaurant wow let's see a theory oh man bill you said i'm with you i'm so with you on this 
[03:37:00]  one bill don't fuck with the government that's not the government it's the oil companies who they're  more powerful yeah they're they were yeah wow they they fucking got him yeah they got him and what  happened to his big fucking well the the brother of uh stan claims that uh i think like a week or two 
[03:37:30]  after his death people broke into where he had this uh this water-powered dune bucky and just just  stole it for the pieces and he doesn't know what happened to it oh come on and his brother's too  stupid like he you know talent like that probably just one person yeah it was just him one guy like  sports center right he doesn't give a fuck right oh he had a water-powered you didn't see that like  that guy you ever like you go on there and you see like some of the inventions that were that were  just suppressed and then they used to just always say that the person was crazy like that guy tesla right 
[03:38:00]  out there yeah tesla's like lunatic all this wireless technology he came up with this shit  i guess in the 1800s and you could actually you just he there was these big ugly things but you'd  put it in and he somehow tapped in the electricity or whatever and you could everyone could have had  it for free and then they like wi-fi electricity yeah and then they just went up there that's real  interesting yeah put him in a fucking headlock you know he's crazy he's talking about force fields and  aliens out of his fucking mind and they just totally destroyed him as a human being and like 
[03:38:30]  150 years later now and edison was their guy hey thomas edison wires goes to a power station you pay  for it and it is all bullshit i was in uh my apartment in la i was getting free internet right  and then out of nowhere all of a sudden i wasn't getting it so then i had to pay for the shits and  then the guy shows up and he puts it on and he goes uh he goes all right i need to adjust this i'm  like what's the matter i'm getting uh i'm getting a good signal he goes yeah but it's too strong it's  too strong so because he doesn't want anybody else to steal all right i don't think it's that big  big a fucking deal we're just all like they don't teach you anything it what do they teach you they 
[03:39:00]  teach you how to add they teach you how to be a fucking drone that goes and sits in a cubicle  and i get my vacation coming up that's what that's what they want you the last thing they want you to  be you know down in the cellar like that fucking guy in back to the future trying to come up with  because they're gonna whack you that's what dr brown yeah all of a sudden everything starts  tasting like almonds you just all over you smell burning hair let's go back to that's it let's go 
[03:39:30]  back to the news story from 1998 uh more on stan meyer yeah it has taken the place of his old gas tank  the water fuel cell breaks down water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen the hydrogen is used to run his  dune buggy i don't care if you use rainwater well water city water ocean water if you don't have any  fresh water and go ahead and use snow if you don't have any snow available to you they use salt  water because there's no adverse effect to the fuel cell and the oil company said here's some poison  water yeah here he goes water sir in the pentagon is interesting you know there's some guy in there 
[03:40:00]  like that fucking like dineros al capone i want him dead i want his house burned down i want that  fucking buggy hair in 10 minutes and when he's pissing on his fucking asses  hey shit dude it's this way yeah you know what kills me is it's that's bad it's so  fucking obvious it's just like that really is and you know i would sit here and argue with bill  burr about this this one go this is bullshit i can't believe they killed him i thought that they 
[03:40:30]  were just going to go the not only did they destroy his character they kill him not only oh that's  horrible not only did uh they kill him we knew that he was dead had to be dead i i'd never heard of  this guy before anyone else poison i can't believe the second part of the story myers started working  on this project four years ago he's not a scientist he isn't even a chemist in fact he never graduated  from college myers was determined he says to design something to protect this country from oil  embargoes and we have calculated that if we take the dune buggy from los angeles to new york we would 
[03:41:00]  roughly use 22 gallons of water the pentagon flew a lieutenant colonel in last week to look at myers  invention there's talk of possibly using it in the star wars defense program and to run army tanks  myers is currently perfecting a water fuel cell for cars it will cost about fifteen hundred dollars  he says it won't need any maintenance and you won't have to replace it it will be at least two years  before the fuel system goes into mass production the day it happens will be one the fuel industry  hates but it'll put a smile on the face of those who've had to say at one time or another fill her 
[03:41:30]  up this is oh fill her up all right he wrote his death sentence right there oh that was it  knowing he's dead it's so obvious they flew in a colonel a lieutenant colonel has flown in and this  is like that brady bunch episode with the ufo no this has got to be older than 98 because they said  the star wars defense this has got to be older than 98. oh there you go it's a ufo no swamp gas  everything i found reference 1998 wow okay wow that he basically came up with a way to make 
[03:42:00]  to kill himself to make the people who are making the most money in this country to go broke broke  i've discovered a way to fuck over the illuminati and come on over to my house  that's it you're done you're fucking done and there's no way there you couldn't just  prevent people from grabbing a bucket of water from somewhere you know so they can't they can't 
[03:42:30]  capitalize it the oil companies can't go okay now we're the water company the number one way to  control people is if you control the energy they figured it out years yeah centuries ago  we need it wow yeah so they got everybody so if this guy you know it's just like hey you want to go  to connecticut i got a bottle of water yeah yeah it's nothing that's and then he would say it's going  to be a day you know bad day for the oil companies but a good day for people that want to say fill her  up but before that day there's gonna be a bad day for stan oh it's gonna start with the shooting a 
[03:43:00]  little dart into his neck from across the fucking room it's gonna start with liquid diarrhea and  with death i'm surprised they didn't take out his brother too yeah that's the kind of thing they  probably really he must have been some kind of billy carter moron motherfucker that they just figured  there's no chance he's retarded just give him some pennies to play with all those guys i used to  bit my act about that shit we used to you'd see these guys in the news they figured out how to make  that their truck run on like ketchup or something and they always show it and then you just never see 
[03:43:30]  never hear about him anymore the uh companies are really looking into this taking a strong  interest so uh what's the weather gonna be like this weekend and it just goes away and  the story that guy's like a fat burger like six months later i'm just clutching his chest  just falls over that motherfucker was just like and it's gonna cost next to nothing it never has to  be replaced and good news a curl's being flown in l.a. to new york on a fucking thimble of water and a 
[03:44:00]  lieutenant colonel and an assassin are being flown in from the pentagon he said everything wrong  everything wait you want to let's hear that again i gotta hear the end of that that meant  every time every time it rained you just put a bucket outside and you could drive to wyoming do  whatever you want run your house it's just because it runs a car doesn't mean it can't create energy to  heat your house and run anything dude i'm gonna tell you and that's why we're headed towards disaster  because the only way to ever make any of this shit change is there's gonna be blood spilled like 
[03:44:30]  you've never seen i'm telling you i can't fucking wait i can't wait jesus christ you're you're loaded  for bear man you're you're ready i am waiting for i don't care what kind of war it is put whatever word  in front oil race uh uh well that's about the only two why don't we get the bell ready ring the bell  every time this uh this stand says something uh that got the pentagon's ear yeah yeah exactly exactly 
[03:45:00]  here we go i don't think uh hold on hold on well what do you got something i think that bell's gonna  break the bell i think the bell's gonna break by the time you get to the end of this how about whammy  sounds i think i got how did you find that man that's great this clip was just floating around  the other day i just thought it was so funny you know because obviously you know i was laughing at  the same thing that you guys are right so you got something good what is it yeah let me hear all  right this will happen every time and that's the assassin yeah the assassin like practicing with the 
[03:45:30]  target of stan stupid stand in the bowels of the pentagon all right here's so here's that same story  again listen for all the things you probably shouldn't have said the top our news here at  six o'clock an age-old dream becoming a reality a local inventor has discovered a way hear this to  use water to run your car it's a major breakthrough that will no doubt make motorists happy and as  ralph robinson explains the pentagon is also showing lots of interest in this project water has always 
[03:46:00]  been considered a precious commodity but stan meyer's invention may make it even more valuable he has  developed what's called a water fuel cell it has taken the place of his old gas tank the water fuel  cell breaks down water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen the hydrogen is used to run his dune buggy  i don't care if you use rain water well water city water ocean water if you don't have any fresh  water go ahead and use snow if you don't have any snow available to you they use salt water because  there's no adverse effect to the fuel cell 
[03:46:30]  if you're really desperate empty the ice ice cube tray  anything spit in it you'll take you to florida  lay a bunch of cactuses out and put plastic  in a rock  make it longer  holy jesus i'm kidding so dead can you come up with  uh another way where you could even i'm trying to how you how you how can you top  air getting killed that that quickly that is the worst thing he could have said 
[03:47:00]  the only people that weren't impressed were people that lived in like new mexico and arizona  holy shit he fucked up so badly  so dead he just could just go to a mosque in the middle east and just yell  fuck a la and you'll live you'll live longer that's pretty much it his invention would  basically collapse our economy yeah basically what would happen he would be driving to no jobs  right the or anything yeah but the amazing thing is that invention as long as it continued to rain 
[03:47:30]  you we could still drive around bitching about the economy they would just build a  fucking roof over the united states and collect yeah a weather machine all right now we got to break  out our fucking weather machine we've had for years we knew we would need this eventually  dude and you know he just gave them all the information they wanted because he probably  viewed them oh this is the united states government i feel important this is great  given his only blueprints his only copy of his what's his fucking name stan myers yeah or my um 
[03:48:00]  mr myers hi yeah uh you think we could meet tonight for dinner okay great yeah yeah it's lieutenant  colonel um smith yeah um yeah we'll need tonight for dinner look um don't don't tell anyone about  this your family or anyone yeah just show up alone can you take a taxi and not your own car  and how many copies of uh the blueprints do you yeah yeah you got the blueprints and and 
[03:48:30]  and the keys to where you keep the doom buggy it's really fascinating yeah we're fascinated with it  you're a great american all right here's the second half uh you got you're ready of course  everything he said that maybe he said you'll hear the gunshot myers started working on this project  four years ago he's not a scientist he isn't even a chemist in fact he never graduated from college  myers was determined he says to design something to protect this country from oil embargoes  and we have calculated that if we take the dune buggy from los angeles to new york 
[03:49:00]  we would roughly use 22 gallons of water the pentagon flew a lieutenant colonel in last week  to look at myers invention there's talk of possibly using it in the star wars defense program and to  run army tanks myers is currently perfecting a water fuel cell for cars it will cost about 1500  dollars he says it won't need any maintenance and you won't have to replace it it'll be at least two  years before the fuel system goes into mass production the day it happens will be one the fuel industry  hates so they'll put a smile on the face of those who've had to say at one time or another fill her 
[03:49:30]  up wow 1500 bucks 1500 bucks a drop in the bucket quite literally 22 gallons what's a gallon of water  cost three thousand two thousand dollars they find a way to get aged into most of the water times 22 we had  to put aids in the water you could have driven across the country for about 30 bucks and you use up  the hydrogen and all that exhausts out i guess is oxygen so and it's clean it's completely and it's 
[03:50:00]  funny you say how much does water cost when this story came out water was still very much free sounds  like a bunch of fat cats out there wow that guy committed suicide by knowledge well you know that's  what it was you know you know what we got to do in honor of stan today you do know right what lock up  your sons lock up your daughters death is on the street and it is called water water water  hell no to h2o hell no to h2o 
[03:50:30]  oh i forgot about this hell no to h2o hell no to h2o  where's the cocaine hell no to h2o hell no to h2o man it's got no taste hell no to h2o gotta go when you  deserve that h2o water so bad man it makes me choke so drop the bottle of water and pick up a  coat in my opinion if it was up to me the whole wild world would take a bath in patsy water is  sleaze causes disease more dangerous than killer bees so man it's worse than murder murder you know 
[03:51:00]  it's overrated i'm talking about hydration rather have a can full of carbonation so pick up a soda  don't be a coward water is worse than milk that turns sour everybody knows cola gives you power  water's only good for taking a shower morning zoo type show now i must bow my head and pray to the  the soda gods all up we look like assholes right now hey uh this is coming in from new hampshire chris
