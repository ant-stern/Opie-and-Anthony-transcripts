<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with jovial banter among Opie, Anthony, and James Norton, featuring a bizarre reference to someone called "Sex Vagel."  A circulated nude picture of Harry Potter becomes an immediate running gag, with Steve repeatedly printing and distributing copies throughout the studio.  The discussion then turns to listener calls, one of which, from a caller named Doug, elicits a heated and suggestive exchange.  Other callers propose increasingly outrageous scenarios for the "who are we waking up?" segment, including a serial killer, a mortician, and a nurse molesting babies.

The hosts launch into a discussion of Britney Spears’ erratic behavior, speculating on whether it's a publicity stunt or a genuine mental health crisis, comparing it to similar incidents involving Paris Hilton.  They also celebrate their high ranking on the Talkers Magazine "Heavy 100" list while commenting on Howard Stern's decline.  Further listener calls, including one from a trucker, contribute to the show's chaotic and sexually suggestive atmosphere.  The segment ends with more banter and a mention of a MySpace video by "Brother Elmo."

A significant portion of the show focuses on Britney Spears’ public meltdown, detailing her shaved head and confrontation with paparazzi.  The hosts analyze her appearance and speculate on her mental state and potential drug use, contrasting her situation with other celebrities who faced similar challenges more privately.  They criticize *Newsday* for its perceived lack of sensational news coverage. A recurring audio bit of a woman throwing a bag against a window plays repeatedly throughout.

Studio guests Big A, a Bronx cab driver with a speech impediment, and Twitchels, who has Tourette's Syndrome, join the show.  A lengthy news segment co-hosted by Big A and Twitchels ensues, punctuated by Big A's speech impediment and Twitchels' Tourette's.  The segment also references Twitchels' previous MTV appearance.  The nude Harry Potter picture remains a recurring gag, handled comedically by the hosts and guests.  A "Rat Cam" news story about a rat-infested restaurant is also discussed.  Numerous caller interactions continue throughout this segment.

The show shifts to a news story about a young girl's death after being thrown from a horse-drawn wagon.  This is followed by comedic bits, including mocking famous speeches and nonsensical wordplay.  A phone call to a Nevada "pleasure menu" establishment is played, with the caller exhibiting symptoms consistent with Tourette's Syndrome.  The hosts then discuss the Anna Nicole Smith body-dispute legal battle, highlighting the judge's emotional breakdown. They criticize Larry King's perceived lack of knowledge about current events and DNA testing.

A staged "beatdown" of Big A, fueled by accusations of disloyalty (and his appearance on the Ron and Fez show), takes place.  Several staff members participate, using sticks, a whip, and a paddle to playfully, but aggressively, strike Big A, who repeatedly identifies himself as "Big A" throughout the ordeal.  Big A is visibly affected by this playful punishment. The segment concludes with further discussion of Big A's perceived betrayal and the "beatdown" itself.

A prolonged in-studio "trial" of Twitchels begins, focusing on his alleged undisclosed involvement with the Scotty and Alex radio show and the Howard Stern-affiliated "Killers of Comedy Tour." The trial incorporates phone calls, listener feedback from "Instant Feedback" and Paltalk, and testimony from other show personalities.  The hosts discuss a previous physical altercation involving Big A, witnessed by the UPS guy, and Big A's upcoming "Big Ass Bash" at the Hard Rock Cafe.  The hosts also humorously connect an INS raid at the Hard Rock Cafe, resulting in many arrests of illegal immigrants, to Santana’s band.

The "trial" features a lengthy and dramatic Jenga game between Twitchels and Danny as a form of punishment.  The game is heavily punctuated by accusations, insults, and off-color jokes, with the nude Harry Potter picture used as a distraction. The hosts and the hundreds of Paltalk viewers excitedly comment on the game's precariousness.  The Jenga game concludes with Danny’s victory, resulting in Twitchels receiving a bare-bottom spanking.  Numerous side conversations and promotional plugs occur throughout the extensive Jenga game, which lasts over an hour.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Shut up! Shut up!  No!  Opie.  I'm stumped because I'm a shapely European blonde.  Anthony.  Jesus, we are just hoarse.  James Norton.  Look at his face. How do you not love it and want to kiss it?  You rock.  Sex Vagel here on the radio with you.  Sex Vagel. 
[00:00:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And Sex Vagel gets hit with poker chips.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  I was only joking.  I was only joking.  I was only joking.  I was listening to the intro there and man, do we beat up me rock a lot.  Good. 
[00:01:00]  Poor E-Rock.  Oh.  I was a little too excited. I forgot.  People set their alarms to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, we like to be a little mellow when we first start.  Let me turn down the music a little bit and wake everybody up.  Wakey, wakey.  Get up.  Now, yesterday we imagined that we were waking up a serial killer.  Yeah, because we don't know who the hell we're waking up in the morning.  Well, consultants, they like to tell you, you know, imagine your audience.  Yes.  Picture them in front of you. 
[00:01:30]  Sometimes you'll get a dopey program director.  That's why I do respect John Minnelli in the end.  He doesn't make us put pictures of our listeners up in front of us like the old days.  You didn't get the memo?  Imagine your listener.  Like, you have to profile your listener.  Yeah.  Imagine him.  That way you'll be able to communicate with him better.  Right.  If there's a picture of him and an image of who he is.  Remember back in the day, we did it in Boston.  We had this whole meeting with our boss and we had to go through a questionnaire. 
[00:02:00]  Like, we had to try to figure out what the listener was like.  Yeah.  How old he was.  What kind of job is he married?  Does he have a girlfriend?  What kind of car does he drive?  If he is married, how many kids?  What kind of job does he have?  How much money does he make?  When he's spending money, what does he spend it on?  Does it go out during the week?  I mean, it was so detailed.  And we're just sitting there like, oh.  And then the program director's like, I want you guys to bring in a picture of the typical Opie and Anthony listener.  So, of course, Ann and I are just dopes. 
[00:02:30]  We're bringing in, like, you know, penthouse centerfolds.  And here she is.  And he's like, guys, what are you doing?  I'm like, this is our listener.  This is who we're talking to.  Oh, man, did he hate us.  And we're, like, just taping it up all over the studio.  I believe.  Guys, nudity.  You can't have nudity in the studio.  You'll get in trouble with human resources.  There it is.  That's the listener photo.  Thank you, Steve.  Yeah.  Steve has brought in a photo.  There's still, boy, a lot of speculation.  A lot of back and forth going on in the office this morning. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  And the second I walked in, this was on my desk, of course.  And we're just not sure.  We're not sure.  It is a little Harry Potter.  Yeah, not sure how hot it is.  It's hot goes without saying.  Yeah.  It's Harry Potter, and obviously a lot of controversy from his role in Equus, where he is nude.  He's nude.  And this is a full frontal nudity picture of little Harry Potter. 
[00:03:30]  But now, Sam seems to think it's photoshopped.  He wants so hard to believe that it's real.  He put it up as his desktop photo.  Why, Sam?  Because you haven't seen anything that small ever?  Yeah, right.  Well, you are a black man.  I'm sorry.  That was a cheap joke.  First of all, I did not put it up as my desktop. 
[00:04:00]  You didn't?  No, that was put up for me.  Oh, I can deny what it was.  Oh, it was put up for you.  Yeah, just by some guy named Sam.  It was on all our desks this morning.  It's the first thing we saw, just like, ugh, me.  What?  It wasn't me who put it there.  Oh, it wasn't?  No.  Yeah.  Well, he seemed to enjoy it more than anybody.  And then he was analyzing.  See the printed out picture that was on everyone's desk?  It's a Harry Potter.  He's kneeling down, light and full frontal nudity.  It's just all lit up. 
[00:04:30]  And he's got the horse behind him.  Well, not that way.  It's kind of sideways.  And he's just kind of got his arms spread out.  He's completely naked.  Now, Sam seems to think that's photoshopped because there's a little line in some of the hair region.  Well, this is the same picture they put out before, like that.  Yeah, they had cropped it earlier.  It's the same picture where they showed it just where it starts getting, as they say in England, down to the naughty bits. 
[00:05:00]  The naughty bits.  Which is the same place the horse cuts off.  Oh, so you're saying because there's no horse and there's no...  Why are we spending our time studying the picture?  See, this is the problem you have.  Our time.  My problem?  It's not our time, Mr. Hand.  Oh, it's our time.  It's Sam's time.  What are you talking about?  John, I know he's not going to be happy with you that you spent all the time preparing for this radio show by staring at that picture. 
[00:05:30]  I didn't know this.  I was studying it.  I didn't know this either.  Right before we got in, Opie, Sam was studying the picture with what they call a jewelry loop where they appraise, like, you know, where they pull it out of their pocket and then hold the ring up.  And look, he was doing that with the photo.  Looking for clarity?  Yes.  Clarity.  Color.  Want to see how many carats?  Carrats.  Well, I must say, if that's really him, he's sporting a few carats. 
[00:06:00]  And, yeah, well, clipped wouldn't fit in there as a C.  So you think it's photoshopped, huh?  Yes, I think it's photoshopped.  But this is not, I did not bring this to the table.  This has been thrown at me all day.  Steve IM'd it.  All day?  We've been here an hour.  Steve, now he's blaming Steve for IMing it to him.  You've got to see this picture.  It was just subject hot.  He IM'd it to me.  It's been put on my desk 14 times already, printed out.  Yet it was thrown in the garbage.  There's no ink left in the printers because Steve is printing out this stupid picture. 
[00:06:30]  Sam's trying to do his work and edit sound down and stuff.  And we kept taking the pictures out of the garbage and just throwing them in front of him on his keyboard.  You know what the problem is with this show?  Oh, please, where to start?  We never left high school.  This is all just high school stuff.  This isn't even like work stuff because you're not allowed to do this at work anymore.  Only here because this isn't a real job.  You know what the saddest part is about that statement over?  All the other guys that we work with, they pretty much just got out of high school. 
[00:07:00]  I know.  Well, that keeps us young and hip.  It gives you something to look forward to, guys.  Right.  That no matter how old you get, you can still act like a complete ass.  And you can still look at pictures of naked men.  For as long as you want, Sam.  And you got an excuse because it's a radio show.  It's a radio show.  Where else could you do that?  No, I'm going to put a radio show.  You couldn't like work at a deli.  Right.  You know deli?  Like sometimes they have fax machines where it'll spit out an order from, you know, those  boys down at IBM. 
[00:07:30]  Want those fish sticks delivered?  Wear the Captain Hook uniform.  Have some pride.  You know, sometimes they have the fax machine at the deli.  You can't just go, hey, you know, I'm going to print out a bunch of these naked Harry Potter  things and just throw them around.  No.  They kind of look at you.  No.  Maybe someone will get upset if they ordered a big sausage sandwich.  Yeah.  And that was laying on the counter.  Why don't you, I don't know, print this up a hundred times, bring it into work today.  Yeah, just bring it in your office.  Just throw it around the office and see what kind of reaction you get.  Fired. 
[00:08:00]  I think the reaction, fired.  Fired, fired, they kick you out on the stoop and throw the pictures on top of you.  You'd get the old, and stay out.  But in radio, we can do this all day long.  All day long.  All day long.  Yeah, it seemed to be a very popular subject this morning.  I don't know.  We can't fire Steve.  Oh, Steve.  Can we fire him?  No, we can't fire Steve.  It's radio.  That's what we're talking about.  He can do this.  Whatever his sexual preferences are, he's free to spread them around.  Yeah, officially, we don't know. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, because he's doing it for work.  We don't know.  Yeah, it was show prep.  Right.  It was show prep.  Throwing around full frontal nudity of Harry Potter within my full God-given right to throw  these all over your desk, and I'm going to keep doing it.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, he requested, could you please not show me this anymore, not give any more of these  to me, which means please, please keep printing them out and throw as many as you can at me.  He pointed out that it is in Sam's employment contract that he is to accept any and all photos 
[00:09:00]  of this nature.  These guys love gay humor.  That's all I know.  Yeah.  I don't know what's going on.  I don't know who.  Humor?  You guys all love gay humor, and there's no surprise, because Steve was the one that  you interviewed with back in the day, right?  That's right.  Who interviewed with Steve?  Sam?  I did.  Sam?  Not Iraq.  I met you on a highway.  You?  Iraq was like finding a stray puppy.  Hope he picked him up, put a collar on him, and he was his.  When I was wandering around, do you know the story of me meeting Iraq?  I was wandering around the country, and I had like a beard and long hair, and I'm coming 
[00:09:30]  back from like South Beach.  I've been on like a month road trip.  A bender.  And I noticed he was like an Uber fan that seemed to have some skills, and I called him  up.  What happened to said skills?  I called him up, and it was a lonely highway.  I don't even know where I was.  Somewhere outside West Palm Beach, I guess.  He won't even be talking to a mic.  What?  Vero Beach.  Vero Beach.  Vero Beach.  And we went to the cheese factory, or the- 
[00:10:00]  Oh.  No, where'd we go?  Cheesecake factory?  Oh, yeah.  Cracker Barrel.  You two went to Cracker Barrel?  We went to Cracker Barrel at a rest area, and I'm sitting there all dazed and confused.  I've been on the road.  I haven't shaved.  And that's how I met Iraq and brought him aboard.  Brought him aboard.  But anyway, so everyone has interviewed with Steve, right?  He just handed me a picture of Iraq driving.  I'm sorry.  Some crappy boat.  It is a crappy boat.  That is a crappy boat. 
[00:10:30]  And I know you come from money.  What's going on?  It's little.  That's a little boat.  That's why we won't feel bad when we finally fire him.  We know he'll be just fine.  He's got some cash, but this doesn't show it.  He's wearing his sunglasses, all cool, hair-blown in the breeze.  It's a nice boat.  And it says, typical ONA listener, which means we have to hang it up.  This is who we're broadcasting to, a dork in a dinghy.  All right, yeah, guys, keep bringing in pictures of the typical ONA listener today, okay?  But, yeah, so Steve interviewed all these guys, hence all the gay humor on a daily basis. 
[00:11:00]  Are you into gay humor?  You're hired.  Do you appreciate a good blank picture?  Notice the glaring omission of any females on our roster.  That wasn't my idea.  Of course it wasn't.  Hiring them?  Of course.  We sure know that.  No, we made a rule a long time ago.  Yeah.  We would never be able to do this radio show if we had females around.  Can't do it with the chicks. 
[00:11:30]  New bit.  Uh-oh.  Opie and Anthony gay moment.  And now another Opie and Anthony gay moment.  There you go.  Thank you, Andy and Jersey.  Gave us a little idea.  We'll see what we do with that.  All right, so Sam.  Steve will get right on that.  Yeah.  Do you want to take the picture back to the lab and study it further?  Yeah, study it more.  Give us some definitive proof.  I like how you picked out the horse's legs that they cut off right where the old picture,  where it was just his lower abs showing and above. 
[00:12:00]  And now there's the same picture, but it's full frontal.  Do you think it's a good Photoshop job?  Oh, it's a good Photoshop job.  Oh.  But it's not real.  Plus, Steve sent it to me, so right away that's a tip off.  Suspect.  Yeah, look what I got.  It's got to be authentic.  It was on the internet.  And I told you that I had to tell them to stop with the gay humor with me.  I had to tap out.  Well, these guys do gay humor all day long.  It doesn't stop.  I had to tap out because I was bringing home some horrific things on a daily basis. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, you know who did that, right?  Who?  The guy who is in the office right now.  No.  What?  No, right behind you, Steve.  Oh, there he is.  Oh, Keith, yeah.  The prankster.  Keith, the cop, the prankster.  Keith was putting the marital aids.  Marital aids.  Rubber devices in your backpack.  The worst marital aids possible.  As Sam would say, in your backpack.  And then the gay porn.  Yeah.  Lots and lots of gay porn.  Steve's collection I found.  Oh, the Steve collection, yeah. 
[00:13:00]  The Steve collection, sure.  Comes from the Steve collection.  Gay porno.  I had to tap out, though.  I'm like, guys, enough, please.  Is this true?  Sam's next blog is a Harry Potter nude pic.  Disappointingly fake.  I didn't say.  No?  Disappointingly.  Oh, you didn't?  Fake.  All right, well.  All right, thank you.  By the way.  Unsettlingly fake.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  So who are we waking up today?  That's what we started with.  Well, yesterday we decided, like, everybody's not good. 
[00:13:30]  We know that.  The world's made up of some evilness.  And we thought with all the people you imagine waking up for work and take care of the house,  whatever.  You got to think out of the box because program directors will say, imagine your audience.  And we're like, all right, it's obvious.  I think out of the box every day.  I hate the box.  Young couples, a lot of dudes, a lot of dudes living with their parents.  Yeah.  You get some Wall Street guys.  You got the construction guys.  We get all that.  Very diverse.  But we want to think out of the box and think about some of the other people were waking up. 
[00:14:00]  Yesterday it was a serial killer somewhere.  Got to be one.  Somewhere.  Maybe.  I mean, we're talking the whole country here is listening.  Yeah.  So somewhere, perhaps a serial killer is getting up off a stained mattress.  Right.  And, you know, he likes the show.  He wakes up with us every morning.  And then at night just gets urges to choke hookers.  We know we're waking up murderers.  Yeah, murderers.  That haven't been caught yet.  See, that's a guarantee.  How you doing?  Good morning.  Good morning to you. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  We kind of gave them yesterday.  What do you want to go with today?  Like coroners, slaughterhouse workers.  Today, boy, when you go with serial killer first.  Yeah.  It's kind of rough to come up with something.  Hey, how about some guy that just works in a butcher shop?  Wow.  How about a guy that just digs graves?  Grave digger.  Yeah.  His shovel's waiting outside the front door.  He's like, yeah.  He's whistling a happy tune as he goes to his car.  He's got to get up and just dig all day.  Dig holes to put dead people in. 
[00:15:00]  Nice.  Or maybe even just a mortician.  Yeah.  Some guy that's got to get up.  He wakes up with us and he shuts his alarm off and gives his yawn.  And just knows he's going to be sticking metal tubes up people's thighs and draining their  blood out.  Yeah.  He's going down to the basement.  Yeah.  Opening up a...  Yeah.  Why the creepy doors, guys?  I don't know.  Can't they just have a pleasant, cheerful atmosphere?  It's always rusted, creaky doors. 
[00:15:30]  A light bulb that just...  You can't hold it still.  Right.  For some reason, it's just swinging slightly.  It's on a motor.  It comes corner.  It's a corner light.  And it just swings if you want that for your house.  And I get it that you've got to keep the body cold.  But why do you have to keep everything else cold?  Everything's got to be freezing in there.  Just everything looks cold.  Everything is just metal.  And why does that...  I understand the cleanliness factor.  So it's got to be a stainless steel table.  We've all seen it with the little neck brace there. 
[00:16:00]  So the little dead person's head isn't flopped back so they're not uncomfortable.  What's that all about?  Neck is propped up.  But can't they put, like, something nice on the sides?  I understand the whole thing has to be nice to hose down.  But it just is so cold and morbid.  Brighten it up.  Not sexy whatsoever.  What about some window treatments?  Sure.  Some color on the wall.  Some wallpaper.  All right.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:16:30]  Let's say hi to Doug.  He's in his car.  Doug, what's up?  Doug on a car phone.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  You guys know you're on the radio?  Oh.  I think this has been a very entertaining break, sir.  Damn.  Damn, it's boring.  I'm boring.  I don't think so, Doug.  Boring.  If it was so boring, you'd have changed it.  I know when I listen to the news on the way in.  If they hit a boring story...  Shut up.  Shut up.  I'm talking now, Doug.  If you're so bored, just change the station. 
[00:17:00]  We'll talk about whatever the goddamn hell we please.  Matter of fact, we'll help you through it.  Jackass.  We have enough confidence in our radio show.  We'll help you through it, Doug.  Turn up our radio show and turn it to another radio show right now live on our show.  No, I'm waiting.  No, no, no.  Don't wait.  Don't wait.  You don't get the show, Doug.  You don't get it.  You don't understand it.  It's just guys talking.  Perhaps you don't understand it.  Or perhaps maybe the gay thing hit a little too close to home.  Doug did it. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, I'll say blah, blah, blah.  What's the matter, Doug?  Maybe a few urges you don't want to tell your buddies about and what we were talking about  in humor got a little too close to home, Doug.  Maybe there's a pal you have that you got a little crush on.  It's a little early to be going to work, Doug, huh?  You told the old wife you had to get into the office early, but what are you really doing,  Doug?  You got to go in a little early, did you?  Are you cruising?  Are you cruising for a little man-meat?  Where are you going?  You're going down to the truck stop, Doug, to go pst, pst, through a little glory hole? 
[00:18:00]  Knock, knock, knock, knock.  Doug.  Knocking on a trucker's door.  Oh, just boy, do you know you're on the radio?  No, we don't, Doug.  No, not a clue.  We've only been doing this for 12 years together, you ass.  It's 12 years we've been doing this, and we have no clue when the mics are on.  What is that light?  It says on air.  Oh, Doug, help us.  And Doug is like, I'm waiting.  No, Doug, just change the channel.  Don't wait.  Because don't tempt us, because we'll make you wait for the next two and a half hours.  We'll do nothing today.  No, I'm going to be at work in 10 minutes, so that's all you get.  There you go. 
[00:18:30]  Wonder what pleasurable job he's got to go to.  Must be a wonderful life Doug's leading.  A closet homosexual with a crappy job who can't change the station on his radio.  Poor bastard.  Oh, boy, this is going to hurt.  Anthony in New York, what's up?  Not much.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I never really liked Doug out Doug in the first place.  Okay.  I don't think that was Doug out Doug.  I just want to throw out there, you guys are probably waking up probably one person in Chicago right now. 
[00:19:00]  All right, look.  That hurts.  It's true, but it hurts.  The caller before you, whatever, we can handle that.  But now you're getting tossed.  Oh, he hung up, too.  All right, so maybe the ratings aren't where they should be in Chicago yet.  Chicago.  Tough town.  But I think we're waking up maybe more than one person.  Jesus.  The guy wanted an agenda or something?  I always love to, like, figure out what that guy wanted. 
[00:19:30]  What did Doug want to listen to?  I have no idea.  Did he want a wacky bit?  Did he want something?  That was just what happened.  Came in this morning.  There's gay pictures laying around the office.  Sorry.  It's kind of interesting that we have a staff that just prints out dozens of gay pictures of Harry Potter naked and throws them around the office.  Sorry to comment, Doug.  It was a little odd.  So he figured we'd just throw it out there.  And I think it maybe titillated Doug a little too much. 
[00:20:00]  He didn't want to listen to that kind of thing.  And he says he listened.  Maybe it made it twitch a little bit.  He got a little twitch while he was driving, and it upset him.  And he says he listens to our show.  No, no, he's a very casual listener, because this is all we do, really.  You know who he's a listener?  We just turn the mics on and hope something sticks.  He's a listener who's, I guess, the number one show he listens to is probably not there today.  Oh, good old Harry.  Just like all week.  Remind me to read the little Howie article in the paper today. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was an interesting tidbit.  That'll get him going on.  When does he get back from vacation?  April?  I don't know.  April sometime in spring.  Somewhere in April.  All right, let's go to Jim in Buffalo.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, why don't we say good morning to that nurse in the hospital that's molesting little  newborn babies?  See?  All right, molesting nurses.  Man, that might be a little far-fetched, Jim, but I guarantee right now we're waking  up a nurse that's going to do some awful things today.  I hope we have an angel of death listening.  Maybe an angel of death. 
[00:21:00]  One of those people with the pillows that just smother old people.  He's just, right now as he wakes up, he's freshening his pillow.  He's fluffing it.  He's fluffing it.  For the next old person schnoz.  He brings his own pillow into work so there's no evidence.  You think he's got to take his own pillow and then get it out of the place?  Yeah, he smothers them with his own pillow and then takes it out with the garbage.  Ah, okay.  Gets it back in his car.  Puts it in there.  Wooks around suspiciously.  Throws it in the dumpster.  All right, thank you, Jim. 
[00:21:30]  Well, we've got to take a break.  I think we've got a lot done on this.  Oh, my God.  On this break.  Good enough for you, Doug.  Stupid gay Doug.  And we want to talk about Britney right off the bat.  We're going to have to do that next.  Yeah.  Can't get enough of Britney Spears.  I want to know your opinion.  After the break, Hopi.  Of course, after the break.  The big tease.  Do you still think she's faking it?  Or is she crazy?  Now, for a couple of weeks now, you've been saying she's doing this as a publicity gag. 
[00:22:00]  Now, as more evidence pours in, I'd like to know your opinion.  After the break.  Oh.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Virus. 
[00:22:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  We have Luz Cannon from New York calling in.  What's up, Luz Cannon?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, you guys are losing it, man.  What?  You guys are losing it.  Terrible.  Jarman, now we've got to take you off already.  Why are we losing it, sir?  Dog house rocks.  Why are you losing it?  Yeah, why are we losing it while you just say the dog house rocks?  Go ahead.  Because it says on your, under comments, it says you guys are corny. 
[00:23:00]  Corny.  You call yourself Luz Cannon and you're telling us we're corny?  Anthony, you need to save the show, man.  You don't need the people listening.  You've got to let that beach blonde work the board op like he's supposed to.  Ah, I got it.  Luz Cannon's shot.  You think this tactic is going to help?  You're going to try to divide and conquer them and try that for over a decade.  It's not even an original one.  You're not a comedian.  You're not even funnier than Jim Norton, man.  I'm not even funnier than Jim Norton. 
[00:23:30]  I'm not supposed to be funnier than Jim Norton, you asked.  He makes a living being funny.  Jim Norton's a comedian.  He's hysterical.  It looks like we got under Luz Cannon's skin when we had that big old brawl with his favorite  radio show.  Yeah, that's okay.  You could be a fan of whatever show you please.  Just call up with all the catchphrases and all the insults that you've heard other people  say because you're not creative enough to come up with your own.  Do whatever your favorite show tells you to do.  Boy, it looks like you weren't able to turn Anthony.  What a surprise. 
[00:24:00]  What happened?  I really thought Anthony was just going to trash me after your phone call.  I was going to take your side, but then I realized you're unoriginal.  You can't come up with anything on your own.  You have to just quote whatever your favorite radio show says.  What?  Listen, and I've been listening to that show for a month.  You guys have been listening to since Star and Buck got kicked off.  Just like most of you, Rick.  Just like most of you.  Since Star and Buck got kicked off?  Star.  You were listening to them?  You were listening to Star and Buck Wild and we're supposed to take you seriously? 
[00:24:30]  Goodbye, Luz Cannon.  Goodbye.  Luz Cannon is a douchebag.  Look, man.  Listen to whatever the hell you want.  I don't give a crap.  And at least have like your own thing.  You know?  Like have your own insults.  I got to make myself feel better.  Let's say hi to Tom in White Plains.  Tom, what's up?  I want to talk about you were just having some great radio about five minutes ago during the break.  And now, you know, you're back to the other side. 
[00:25:00]  Just kidding.  Is this making you feel better, Opie?  You said you were taking this call to make yourself feel better.  Well, under comments.  I don't know.  I'm feeling queasy all of a sudden.  Under comments, it says, finally, it's great radio.  Maybe he's listening to another show.  Ah, whatever.  All right.  Oh, by the way, I want to apologize to the truckers, too.  We pretty much made a blanket statement that they're all gay.  And we have a huge audience that drive trucks. 
[00:25:30]  So not all you guys are gay.  Maybe about 65%.  I don't even remember making that statement or hearing it.  I thought you were going to apologize to say it because it was implied that all truckers  do their waste in a plastic bag and then throw it at their truck windows like we had a woman  do yesterday.  Over at the other joint.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But no, you're apologizing.  When did we decide they were gay?  Go ask Al if we could play the audio of what Anthony just described without describing it. 
[00:26:00]  Like, all of a sudden, in the middle of the show, we just play it.  Yeah.  This is how we get around some stuff.  Remember what Anthony said, and then maybe 20 minutes to a half hour later.  Ah, you play it.  We'll just play it because it did actually happen with a female trucker.  Yeah.  She did what she did in a bag and then threw it up against the window.  Tied the bag up real nice.  That's why.  And then threw it against the window.  That's why we're the hottest channel on XM Satellite Radio.  Of course.  It's like that.  Stop. 
[00:26:30]  It goes without saying.  No, I do have to apologize to the truckers because you told that other guy who hated us  that he was, like, cruising for, you know, man-on-man action at the truck stops.  At the truck stops.  Well, just because gay sex is going on at the truck stops doesn't mean all truckers are gay.  Like I said, 60% to 65% are, though.  But when you got a, I guess, predominantly guys driving the trucks, very lonely.  It's a long haul, some of those things.  And they go pull up to these truck stops and there's things in there like showers. 
[00:27:00]  There's showers.  Showers with no doors.  Yeah, maybe, you know.  There's something going on.  Yeah, maybe there's things going on.  That's all.  How much are you saying?  60%?  60% to 65%, yeah.  Yeah.  That about covers it.  All right.  That'll fix it.  I think we're getting some negative calls today because good old Howie.  Well, he's decided to take a week, two, three weeks off, I guess.  Well, yeah.  He's not even the... 
[00:27:30]  I'm engaged.  I'm taking off.  How bad is it for him?  He's not even the most famous Howard Stern anymore.  Nope.  Remember when you said the words Howard Stern and it was just, you knew who they were talking  about in the news.  Yeah.  Now, they say Howard Stern and you know who they're talking about.  Howard K. Stern.  Howard K. Stern.  The lawyer.  The lawyer, shyster, whatever.  I can tell you this much unless you could find out otherwise.  I'm still the most famous Greg Hughes in America and you're still the most famous Anthony 
[00:28:00]  Koumia in America.  Yes, but I am changing my name to Anthony K. Koumia.  Just to protect your...  I'm heading it off at the pass just in case some guy shows up and there's some dead blonde  involved.  He makes the news.  Yeah.  I don't want him using my name.  If you hate the show, give us a call.  We find it to be a lot of fun.  It's like sports for us.  And usually it happens when Howard's taken off because, you know, he leaves them high and 
[00:28:30]  dry and they got to listen to something.  So he decided, you know, to take a listen to us.  And guess what?  Some of them, we end up turning around.  Yeah.  The ones that don't call that just listen and go, all right, I'll listen because that's  99% of the listeners.  They don't call in.  But then there are people that are so angry that maybe they found something funny or interesting  or maybe they were insulted by something or whatever it was.  It drove them to take their phone, dial our number.  First, they have to find it out and then dial it up and actually voice some type of complaint 
[00:29:00]  about the show.  Yeah.  Well, hitting a nerve is great.  And we don't care if they like it or hate it.  We made that idiot call us.  Yeah.  And we don't want to insult all the Howard fans out there.  We know we're not going to turn a bunch of you around.  We understand that.  Well, we're not going to take the crap from these idiots that are calling our show.  No.  And this is going to just piss off Howard.  In the Daily News today, the headline is, Stern has lost his number one spot. 
[00:29:30]  Good old Talker's Magazine.  A magazine, I got to be honest with you, we hated last year.  Yes.  But now we love them.  One of the best trade magazines ever in the radio industry is what I say.  And you could quote that.  They should have Anthony Comey of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  And then the quotes, one of the best trade magazines in the industry.  We really are asses.  Last year, we're trashing these guys.  This year, we can't get enough of them.  Love them.  We can't get enough of them.  Love them to death.  Because they do their, what is it, their top 100 talkers in America issue. 
[00:30:00]  And last year, we were in the second 100.  The second tier.  The second tier.  They did the top 100.  And then they do like another 100 talk shows that they want to just mention.  That are kind of interesting talk shows.  Now, the top 100 has a picture and then a little bio on the show, what cities they're  in, if they're syndicated nationally, a contact number for an agent, websites, a lot of info 
[00:30:30]  on the first top 100.  Yeah.  And then the second, like the second 100, the 200 on, that's where the names are listed  like honorable mention.  Yeah.  You just get the names.  Yeah.  You'd miss it.  We couldn't even find us last year.  We were buried in a bunch of names.  We had to like scrawl like three or four times.  Yeah.  Where is it?  Why?  Just to find it.  Hold on.  Really fast.  I love when the listeners help us out and then pile on top.  Don in Buffalo, what's up? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  His name's not Luce Cannon.  It's Luce Cannon.  Him and Doug are a couple, actually.  Oh.  All right.  How do you like them apples?  Getting a little more info.  Either they love you or they love to hate you.  I'm out.  Yeah.  I guarantee they're still listening.  Don from Buffalo was being corny.  We know this game.  They're still listening because they want to know what we were saying about them today.  Yeah.  Because now we're talking about them and they could be all, they're smiling.  Did you hear?  Did you hear?  They were talking about me this morning.  So Talkers Magazine last year, they didn't even put us in the heavy hundred. 
[00:31:30]  No.  And then we called in some favors from our pals in Little Italy and maybe we called some  pals in the NYPD.  The guy needed some persuading.  He needed some persuading and it's a lot different this year.  Last year we didn't even make the heavy 100.  This year we came in sixth place.  From not even in the hundred to sixth.  Well, we spoke to, I got, what was his name?  Do you remember?  Can't remember. 
[00:32:00]  Is it Michael Harris or Harrison or something like that?  Something like that.  Yeah.  Close enough.  He knows.  We spoke of them because we were very upset that some of these people that were in the  top hundred, no one ever heard of.  Yeah.  It was like a, like a pet psychologist.  Neil Bortz.  Nah, Neil Bortz.  And they were, they were all beating us and we were like, we asked them, honestly, how  could you put this person in front of us?  Even without being conceited or anything, just, you could put these names in a computer  and it would spit our name out first. 
[00:32:30]  How did you come up with this?  And he went, it was a mistake.  Yeah.  He actually said it was a glaring error.  Yeah.  It was an oversight.  An oversight.  He used every type of word for error.  That's what you want to be, an oversight in this world.  We were just an oversight last year.  Yeah.  So this year, well, not only did we crack the top ten, made it all the way down to number  six.  Number six.  Beating out such names as Bill O'Reilly.  Bill O'Reilly.  Who was in 15th place.  Don Imus, our pal, in 14th place.  Yeah.  Howard Stern in 12th place. 
[00:33:00]  12th place from number one.  Yeah.  He was number one for years.  Yeah.  Mankow in 11th.  Even Mankow beat Howard.  How's Mankow even in there, though?  I don't know.  Glenn Beck in 10th.  Neil Bortz.  Neil Bortz.  Neil Bortz.  In ninth, then you got Mike Gallagher and then Laura Ingram.  And then in sixth place, Opie and Anthony.  And Ed Schultz beat us.  Dr. Laura Schlesinger beat us.  Michael Savage is in third.  Sean Hannity in second.  And then the top dog this year is Rush. 
[00:33:30]  Rush.  Rush Limbaugh.  So, David Hinckley did a whole write-up in the Daily News today.  And the headline reads, Stern has lost his number one spot.  And this just makes us very, very happy.  A year into his new gig at Satellite Radio, Howard has a lot more money and engagement ring.  And what he says is far greater peace of mind.  What he doesn't have, according to the leading radio trade magazine, Talkers, is his former stature as the most important talk radio host in America.  Talkers' annual heavy 100 list drops Stern from the number one spot, which he held last year, to number 12. 
[00:34:00]  One to 12.  And like we said, he's not even the most famous Howard Stern anymore.  No.  It's looking bad for this man, I got to tell you.  He's got a lot of money, but it's looking bad.  As far as career goes.  Yeah.  He's still doing very well, says Michael Harrison, editor of Talkers.  But this list is about what's hot.  And you just don't hear about Stern the way you did before you went to Satellite.  Nope.  People don't talk about what he said the way they used to.  Hence the merger, by the way.  We'll get into that another day. 
[00:34:30]  A year ago, he had put Satellite on the map.  He was a liberal talk voice, even though that's not how people defined him, who got huge ratings.  He pioneered a style of FF talk.  Who, who, who, pioneered?  He absolutely deserved to be number one last year.  But that was then, and this is now.  We had to ask what talk hosts are most important in the radio industry now.  And then he writes, some people are furious about this list, says Harrison.  But Opie and Anthony, for instance, are now the biggest thing in FM talk. 
[00:35:00]  They belong where they are, and so does Stern.  The tide is a change.  Thank you.  The tide is a changing.  Isn't that something?  Last year, that man was despised by us.  Now he's just throwing out the compliments.  What a guy.  All right.  Let's say hi to Mike in Illinois.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey there, Mike.  Well, thank you, boys, for waking me up in time to catch that little paper boy that's going to go by in about two minutes. 
[00:35:30]  I got to go.  Bye.  Oh, he's, uh, we just woke up a pedophile.  I get it.  Oh, is that it?  Still doing that bit there.  Hey, Ann, I just want to play something right now.  Don't even want to wait 20 minutes to 30 minutes.  Just want to play something.  Just going to play it.  I'm just going to play something.  Hopefully you're smart to, to, to, to, to, to, to, uh, uh.  Oh, um, uh, you're playing charades with me.  Your hand was going like you were writing something.  Hope you're smart enough to cross your T's and dot the I's. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, okay.  You know.  You are writing something in the air.  There you go.  I just want to play this.  That's all I want to say.  Okay.  Go ahead, E-Roy.  Okay, I'm tying the bag up.  Did you hear it?  Yeah.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Okay.  All right.  One more time.  Throw it against the window?  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay. 
[00:36:30]  Here we go.  Truckers are lonely people.  They got to find their entertainment where they can.  Sometimes they help us out, too.  That's all we're allowed to say.  Yeah.  Whatever.  We just got to move on.  Alan, the trucker.  What's up?  Hey, since you guys are talking about the talkers list, I wonder how, uh, Bumble is a contraceptive  sponge stacks up.  Since, uh, you guys are much higher on the list than, uh, Howard, you guys have a greater 
[00:37:00]  chance of keeping the job than he does.  Look, I mean, uh, you know, do your own math.  If, uh, people are talking about Howard less, what do you think they're doing with Bubba the  love sponge?  The only people talking about Bubba were us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because he had, uh, you know, addressed our show and how we weren't going to be around  for a while.  He said that about, uh, our, our contract in, uh, last October, that it wasn't going  to be re-signed.  He had all this inside info and, uh, not only were we re-signed, but we got a big extension 
[00:37:30]  on the contract.  Like, he was completely wrong.  And you don't want to hear him comment about that.  And then the latest news was his producer had said, Mel, uh, Carmisen had, uh, said that,  uh, we were out.  Well, uh, Mel, Mel can't talk to anybody about this deal except maybe the Securities and Exchange  Commission and the Federal Communications Commission, not, uh, Bubba's producer.  Oh yeah, it was Bubba's producer that, that had a combo conversation with Mel. 
[00:38:00]  And by the way, and by the way, he's not even down there.  Like, Mel has been in Washington for the past week discussing this merger.  Uh, he hasn't been in Tampa or wherever the hell they broadcast from, where the hell do  they broadcast from?  I don't even know, but I don't think Mel's making fun because I don't think Mel's wheeling  and dealing about the merger and then going, the deal's done.  Get me Bubba's producer on the phone.  Not before the news.  The guy is a lying sack that should be thrown against the window. 
[00:38:30]  We really try not.  We really try not to lie on this show.  So we do our best not to lie.  Yeah, I got a question for you.  Yeah.  Uh, since Mel is tied so close to Howard, how did he wind up in charge of a series that  like Howard taken there as part of his, uh, signup deal?  That's right, Mel.  Who knows?  Nah, I don't know what kind of wheeling and dealing's going on behind the scenes over there,  but apparently, uh, they felt that he was the guy.  He's a finance guy, always has been. 
[00:39:00]  He's a money guy.  So, uh, if you've got a company that needs, uh, help with their, their cash, you bring  in someone like Mel.  The problem is, uh, after you come up with a great idea of a merger is actually making  it work.  Yeah.  And that, that, that's going to be a tough one as far as the, the feds go and everything  else.  Mel's got to go before they just announced yesterday.  Mel's got to go before some kind of a commission now that's been put together to decide whether  this merger can legally go through between the satellite radio companies, just in case 
[00:39:30]  you know what we're talking about.  Yeah.  It's been all over the news, but, uh, so he's got to go and he's got to go in front of the  same people that he was lambasting about, uh, indecency when he worked for Viacom.  So they're going to look and go, okay, what do you got for us now?  Smarty pants.  It's going to be really interesting next week.  Well, there's a greater chance of keeping the rising stars of you guys that a failing old  declining star of Howard and bubbles, there is going to happen. 
[00:40:00]  Bubbles.  Bubbles.  Okay.  New name.  Makes him sound like the chimp.  Bubbles.  All right, Alan.  You guys do a great job.  And as for bubbles, the contraceptive sponge, well, keep on dreaming.  You use that one already.  Keep on blowing hot air.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Alan, the trucker.  Uh, by the way, remember we were asking, what did you think?  He said 60% gay.  What about him?  Um, 40 or 60?  A little gain in his voice.  A little bit.  Yeah.  He gets the urge every once in a while.  Just every once in a few, a few thousand miles, roll by. 
[00:40:30]  He's in the locker room at the gym.  He's, he's, he's, he's taking a look.  He's looking.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  He's not doing anything, but he's taking a look.  He's taking a little peek.  I want to get your professional opinion.  Oh, absolutely.  He's in the urinal next to you.  He's a little quick little glance.  Um, we got, uh, pictures of the typical opium Anthony Lister.  Anthony.  Yeah.  My, my, uh, my brother's here.  You want to help out pal talk today and show the pictures of the typical opium Anthony listeners?  Come on now.  Page two can't be a typical listener. 
[00:41:00]  Why?  Oh God.  But this is more of a visual.  How are you going to explain it?  It kind of looks like the, the upside down head kid from family guy.  That's like chubsy, ubsy and drag.  Or it could, I'm looking at page two.  Oh, the other one.  Yeah.  The other one on page two.  Okay.  Or a fatty pig fatty.  Yeah.  Kind of like a woman.  Kind of like an Oliver Hardy with like pigtails.  Very good.  Well, well, for the pal talk cameras, my brother will show up, uh, show some pictures of the 
[00:41:30]  typical opium Anthony Lister.  And, uh, yeah, you can picture along with us if you're watching at home on pal talk.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  You can do it over there.  That'll be easier for you.  And don't forget, uh, get one of my brother's t-shirts, will you?  He's got bills to pay.  Give the big plug really fast.  Really fast.  Go really fast.  You got like 15 seconds.  Well, first of all, if you want to see the Bubba, what he's all about, go to, uh, Brother  Elmo on MySpace. 
[00:42:00]  You'll see a little video I made about him.  And then you could find some shirts.  Thanks.  All right.  Brother Elmo on MySpace.  It's the opium Anthony show.  It's the opium Anthony show.  That's right.  You're checking out the opium Anthony show.  Having a fun morning today.  Good morning.  We're having breezy conversation.  Is it breezy?  I don't know what this is.  John Minnelli likes when Ant and I have breezy conversation.  Breezy conversation. 
[00:42:30]  I swear to God, someone plucked him out of 1935.  I like, all right, listen, John.  I like the breezy conversation.  Our goal is to get as many people listening to the show as possible.  And he likes when we're just having breezy conversations.  And I'm thinking to myself, man, that's not going to get the job done.  Not breezy.  When it's a breezy day, are people talking?  That's breezy conversation.  No, but are they talking about it?  No.  It's just kind of breezy out.  Do you talk to your friends like, wow, it's kind of breezy out today? 
[00:43:00]  Or do you talk when there's a hurricane coming or a tornado touches down?  That's what you want.  We want a conversation that sounds more like a tornado's coming.  Yeah.  Disaster.  Not breezy.  Imminent disaster.  Your house could blow away.  I forgot to mention that because we love talking about John Minnelli here.  He's the program director in New York City.  And I think he oversees the whole network, too, as far as regular radio goes.  And, yeah, he writes these emails.  I like when you and Ann are doing your breezy conversation back and forth. 
[00:43:30]  Do you?  Ugh.  Does reading your emails on the air count as breezy conversation?  I bet he doesn't enjoy those.  He's picking his words these days because he knows it goes on the air.  So, like, half of the email is what he wants to tell us, and the other half is him vindicating himself for said email.  This is my way of reading less emails, by the way.  Yeah.  Because I read everyone's emails on the show.  So they don't want to email you.  Now I get emails from people, and it's a lot less than it used to be. 
[00:44:00]  And it's like one-word answers, like, yes, I'll be there, Friday at noon.  Like, it's something that wouldn't be good for the air.  Yeah, it's just all very vague stuff, but it answers what I was asking them.  Because they don't want to give anything else.  Decoding machine to figure out what they're talking about.  Yeah.  You know, because you get barred down with all the crap.  Yeah.  All the crap in your email.  Joe the trucker, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Joe. 
[00:44:30]  Hey, Joe.  How are you?  I'm just going to let you know that as truckers, we might be rednecks, and we might be hillbillies,  and we might be fat-sos, but we're not queers.  Fat-sos.  Isn't it fun to say fat-so?  I guess not.  I was thinking, man, we might have to add another word to the list of words we like to say.  How you were saying nude.  Nude.  I like the word nude.  We might have to add that to the list of words we like to say on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:45:00]  It has to be said like nude.  Right.  Okay.  Well, Britney Spears, everyone's talking about her today.  It used to get me all hot when I'd be in this supermarket.  And remember Leg's pantyhose?  Yeah, yeah.  When they came out.  It was for some reason, as a kid, just walking down the aisle and seeing the words spelt out on this little egg, nude.  And it was the color of the stocking.  It was nude.  It used to get me so worked up.  Into a froth.  Into a froth.  I'm talking, you know, like probably nine, ten years old, something like that, just kind of walking around. 
[00:45:30]  And for some reason, I just knew that was kind of it.  It was almost like reading a dirty word.  Nude.  It used to be fun to read dirty words.  Hee, hee, hee.  You know, you pass by all the other stupid colors.  Go right to nude.  Nude.  All right.  Britney, what do you think?  What do you think?  Well, that's the question I posed to you, Opie, in the big tease before our break an hour ago. 
[00:46:00]  You had been saying Britney is doing this for publicity.  She's a genius for doing it.  She's in the press every day now.  Now, with all the other facts coming in, she's kind of extending this if it's a publicity stunt.  Do you think she's doing this for publicity or is she legitimately lost her effing mind?  I really believed in the beginning she was doing it to keep her name in the press.  In the beginning, I'm getting a vibe here from you.  Oh, she's as crazy as they come now.  Just a complete coup.  She has finally turned me to. 
[00:46:30]  Because, like, you look at Paris Hilton.  She's famous for being what?  A slut.  Kind of a partier.  But she's famous for nothing.  No discernible talent whatsoever.  But she figured a long time ago that if you do crazy stuff, the paparazzi are going to pick up on it.  They're going to splash your pictures all over the place.  And people are going to talk about you.  You're a rich broad.  Like, really, try to figure out what she's famous for.  For being a party girl.  Yeah.  Back in the day, you couldn't be famous for being just a party girl.  But she figured it out. 
[00:47:00]  And then, you know, you start carrying around little dogs and little monkeys and this and that.  It all started innocent.  Like, all of a sudden, the thing was to carry a little dog around.  The paparazzi goes crazy.  Splashes the photos everywhere.  And then Paris Hilton made this a sport.  You've got to credit her.  And then she invented the oopsie shot.  Oh, yeah.  Because, like, you know, if you're posing nude in Playboy or Penthouse, people are like, oh, my God, you're a slut.  But if you just give a little oopsie like you didn't mean to do it, you know, you're getting people talking about your privates and stuff. 
[00:47:30]  And you're getting your pictures splashed all over the place and get people talking, that helps your fame.  It started out what the newspaper would call the nip slip.  The nip slip.  They would call it.  Sure.  And they would print these in, I don't know, sometimes Penthouse would print them, like celebrity nude, bought nude thing.  Before that, they didn't even go with the nip slip.  It was just the see-through top.  Yeah, see-through top.  They knew what they were doing.  That's where it kind of started.  Very innocent.  That was the big slip.  Like, when you saw that, you looked at the picture and went, wow, boy, there's a faux pas. 
[00:48:00]  Remember in the back of Playboy when they would show those black and white photos of, like, celebrities?  Yeah.  I always thought that was hotter than the complete nude shots that were in the magazine.  Yeah.  Like, all of a sudden, you know, I guess I have to date myself, but, like, Sharon Stone when she was hot, all of a sudden was, like, showing, like, a see-through number when you see what she's got going on.  Yeah.  That, to me, was a lot hotter than the, you know, the centerfold.  Yeah, than the full porn shot.  But now, yeah, Paris brought it to a whole new level with the oopsie, which is the getting in and out of the car shot. 
[00:48:30]  Now, there are ways ladies should get in and out of a vehicle.  I believe women from a very early age, I mean, call it five, six, they understand that they're wearing a lot of these skirts and stuff.  They know how to get in and out of vehicles and know how to sit down the right way and all, because they know.  Like, the skirt, so it kind of hides something when you're getting out, things like that.  You're trying to tell me Paris Hilton and Britney Spears and all these people and Lindsay Lohan, they all of a sudden forgot how to get in and out of a car when they're wearing, like, a skirt with no, you know, panties on. 
[00:49:00]  No panties and paparazzi everywhere when they open the door.  Yeah.  They fling that door open, and it's like one leg is connected to the door.  Yeah.  It just wham.  Yeah.  And you just see flashes going off.  You would be even more careful knowing the cameras are just waiting for you to open that door.  Yeah.  So they knew what they were doing is what I'm getting at, and Paris Hilton, I really, she brought it to a new level with the oopsie, and then Britney decided to do the oopsie.  So I was thinking that this is just the next step where Britney's like, I'm going to just shave my head in public, especially because she did it in public. 
[00:49:30]  I think if you're really, really crazy, you're doing stuff behind closed doors that people never hear about.  Pulling it out by the roots.  Yeah.  Exactly.  And you're leaving big clumps.  Pulling out your own eyelids, whatever.  Eyelids.  Eyelashes, whatever the case might be.  Eyelashes.  Oh, eyelashes, yeah.  Sorry.  Now that's crazy.  Sorry, yeah, eyelashes.  Yeah.  You're doing all that behind the closed doors.  You're not doing it in public.  Yeah.  So that's when I was suspicious. 
[00:50:00]  I'm like, she's getting her head shaved with a paparazzi, making sure she's framed perfectly through the window so she can get some good shots.  I think that's just a calculated drunk move.  I think that's something you do like she maybe was thinking publicity, but she was so drunk or on drugs that perhaps she thought it was a good idea.  And then when she sobered up, that's when she bought that awful wig that she plops on her head now. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Sometimes she makes a mistake and carries the wig and puts the dog on her head.  That wig is awful.  And she's now on the cover of all the papers today with her shaved head, making – she has finally got crazy eyes, too.  Oh, yeah.  She used to have those sexy – they called it being slow-eyed for some reason.  When the edges of your eyes kind of dip down a little, it gives you bedroom eyes.  Bedroom eyes, exactly.  Bedroom eyes.  Yeah.  Well, she has padded room eyes now. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, yeah.  She's got those saucer glazed over but always huge.  Yeah.  Like big, nutty woman eyes.  She's lost her mind.  Yeah.  Now I completely believe that she's just nuts.  She has ruined herself, by the way.  I was telling Anthony in the office, there's no way she comes back from this.  No.  Because her fans are all like little girls that kind of want to feel sexy.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Private pile is not sexy. 
[00:51:30]  Right.  And now their hero is doing this.  And then what?  She is in rehab for the third time, I guess.  After this incident, they drove her right to a rehab.  And basically, I think they put her in a padded room.  She's only stayed like a day each time she's been there.  That's her third attempt.  Third attempt, but she is in rehab.  And what?  She's going to clean up 30, 60, 90 days, come out, grow her hair back, and get on the stage  in the sexy outfits, and everyone's going to go, all right, we forgive her.  No.  When you go to this level, when your audience is little young girls and stuff, there's no 
[00:52:00]  way you come back from this.  No way.  I was telling Anne, if like Kurt Cobain did this or someone of that stature back in the  day, you would give him a little leeway.  All right.  Yeah.  That's why I like this guy.  Yeah, because he's off his rocker.  He's off his rocker.  He's nuts.  He's edgy.  But little girls are not going to go to her shows ever again, because they're going to  be scared.  They're going to be just scared.  Mariah Carey went batty, and not half as batty as this, as far as shaving her head and  doing things like this in public.  She went batty, but behind the scenes. 
[00:52:30]  That's what I'm telling you.  I mean, you really didn't get to hear a lot about what was really going on in our head.  No, a lot of speculation.  Just a glimpse or two.  That was it.  Well, the Daily News here in New York, and I'm sure a lot of the papers around the country  have these pictures.  Except for Stupid Newsday, our hometown paper.  Did they put real news on the cover?  Those dogs.  Long Island has this paper.  It's Newsday.  This used to be kind of tabloid-ish, and we make fun of the papers for being tabloid-ish,  but the reality is, yeah, I love waking up in the morning and seeing Britney with an umbrella 
[00:53:00]  jabbing a car.  Beating up a car.  I love this stuff.  The car.  If I want real news, I'll go read the New York Times or something, which I do from time  to time.  But Newsday is just, they don't even know what the hell they are.  On the front page, they got a headline, Sleeping with the Fishes.  South Street Seaport Plan.  Owner of Pier 17 Mall Wants to Raise It, Build Residential Retail Development.  This is on the front page?  Wow!  Why is this on the front page? 
[00:53:30]  You got Britney with an umbrella.  You got the crying judge.  Crying judge who's a treat.  And you go with this story as your headline?  And it's from where we're from, Long Island.  It's an embarrassment, this Newsday.  But anyway, go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Barely read it.  Daily News, front page.  Yeah, front page.  There she is.  She's got that green umbrella.  She's got her mouth clenched.  Her eyes are open wide.  She's got the battle stance.  And she's whipping that umbrella back and smashing the tip of it into the door of this vehicle. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Which, I guess, was it Kevin Federline's house?  Yeah, she went over to Kevin Federline's house.  K-Fed.  K-Fed.  It's a bit sketchy.  But I think she wanted to see her kids.  Or I think she just loves Kevin Federline.  I think the guy did something crazy that made her want to divorce the guy.  But she can't get over him.  Or she wanted to see the kids.  So she goes to his apartment, which is on a quiet street, by the way. 
[00:54:30]  But the paparazzi have been following her ever since she shaved her head, especially.  She's not going anywhere without cameras.  Right, right.  And he wouldn't let her in.  I think he even ignored that she was at the door, even though she just knows that he was in there somehow.  Yep.  So then she comes running out, running back toward the car.  Her mom's in another car, by the way.  Yeah.  Scared out of her mind.  And then Brittany gets this umbrella, I don't know from where, and starts stabbing the car or the SUV of a paparazzi.  She's beating the car.  And then her umbrella breaks. 
[00:55:00]  And they got three pictures snapped in rapid succession on page three of the Daily News.  That shows her hitting the car, the umbrella breaking, and her shirt lifting up just above her belly button.  And she's wearing these, like, gym shorts.  And they're pulled down a little bit.  Her belly is hanging out like somebody that's ready to just sit and watch a Sunday football game.  Well, you know what she looks like?  I was trying to figure it out.  I think I finally got it. 
[00:55:30]  Because they have a now and then picture of Brittany Spears.  Oh, which is the worst thing they could do for this girl.  She's all hot with her blonde hair.  And now you got this picture that's on pretty much every paper in America today.  All made up.  She's smiling.  She looks all cute like she did back then.  She looks like a freshman high school football player that has to shave his head because it's part of, like, a hazing.  Because I'm like, she kind of looks.  Wow, that's bad.  But that's what she looks like now.  She kind of looks like a boy that's sort of starting to get the hormones going. 
[00:56:00]  But he plays football.  She looks like a chubby boy.  Yeah.  She's got those big, like, legs now.  Big tree trunk legs.  Her gut is hanging out over her shorts when her shirt is pulled up.  And the shaved head.  The crazy eyes.  And this was America's sweetheart.  Yeah.  This was America's sweetheart.  You forgot to talk about the bruise on her hip.  She's got a nasty bruise on her hip that they got a close-up of as well. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  I think that's from just falling down drunk somewhere.  That's all.  They're trying to look into it.  But she's had some drunken nights.  I think that's all that is.  She can't take the news just pounding her with this how hot she used to be and what she looks like now.  Yeah.  And the K-Fed angle, I guess.  Boy, who would think Kevin Federline was the one that would come away from this looking like the sane, rational guy?  Yeah.  Like, he's the responsible one. 
[00:57:00]  He's going to have custody of the kids while she is in rehab.  They did the old switcheroo.  The old switcheroo.  Because I thought Kevin Federline was like the guy that was laughable.  But now, look.  Irresponsible out partying and stuff.  And it turns out Britney's the nut.  So, what sucks is I couldn't find the video online because the guy who shot it is looking for a payday.  He used to get this stuff pretty easily, but now they're all looking for their payday.  They want the big bucks for these. 
[00:57:30]  There were a couple websites that had the video.  And by the time I got there, it was taken off.  Had to take them down.  They must have gotten cease and desist.  Yeah, they certainly did.  So, the insider last night, they had audio, which wasn't as good as seeing the video.  And these still shots that everyone's looking at today.  I want to see the video, though.  Oh, yeah.  I guess it was like two minutes long, too.  That's a great tirade.  Absolutely.  No, that...  Oh, God.  James and Milton, what's up?  James. 
[00:58:00]  Hey, what's up?  I was just reading online the other day.  And apparently, some of her close friends said that the reason she shaved her head was because the K-Fed wanted to get her hair drug tested.  Yeah, they said that was all BS.  How...  That was just...  That is such a dumb...  I heard that, too.  And it's like, what?  Oh, my drats.  Foiled again?  She shaved her head.  Right.  We can't figure out how to test for drugs without hair. 
[00:58:30]  We almost had her, too.  If it wasn't for that meddling hair cutter.  Those meddling kids.  Come on.  Come on.  It was...  All right.  Eddie in Jersey.  What's up?  Hey, I just want to say, I like your guys' show.  I listen to you every day.  Thank you, Eddie.  We need a little more positive reinforcement here.  People like to go after us.  Yeah, you guys are funny as heck.  Heck.  But new things.  What that guy just said about the drug testing, that's stupid because everybody knows she's  in rehab for drug testing, for drugs. 
[00:59:00]  The second thing is, she hit that guy's paparazzi car with the umbrella.  Yeah.  And she went back and sat in the car like, oh, my God, I've got to do this for publicity.  Like, it didn't look like...  It was staged.  She...  You know what I'm saying?  I think she's nuts, but I think she also kind of enjoys the fact that the paparazzi are  taking their shots and, oh, you have to listen to themselves.  Now he's got to hear himself.  I can't have a conversation with someone that has to listen to themselves after they ask  the question.  Question done.  Quick.  Volume.  Volume.  Volume. 
[00:59:30]  I think it's a bit of both right there.  Yeah.  I like the spotlight, but she's also completely going nuts.  But she's making these...  Yeah, she's trying to do some things for publicity, sure, but she's making these decisions drunk  or on drugs, so you're not making the wisest decisions as to how you want to put yourself  into the public eye, so that's why she's coming off looking like a nut.  All right, let's go to Tom in Hot Pog.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  She's getting alienized, like they're two eyeballs running away from each other. 
[01:00:00]  They're running away from...  She's got like that crazy look, like the chick from American Idol that tried out in Minnesota.  Yeah.  Crazy chicks get these like frying pan eyes.  They're like flat.  Like, you know how your eyes are kind of...  Well, not kind of, they're round.  They're round eyes.  Something happens when people go a little nutty where the front of their eyes seem to  flatten out.  And they're like, get this look. 
[01:00:30]  And Britney's got it.  Yeah, let's say hi to Larry on Long Island.  Larry, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just want to say, I started listening maybe six, seven months ago, and you guys have the  greatest morning show ever.  Oh, thank you, Larry.  Wait, Larry.  Larry, you didn't listen to us back in the day?  I actually, no.  I listened once in a while.  My buddy had XM, and I knew about you guys a little bit, but I was a Stern fan, and I  stopped listening to him, because it was bitch and moan, and then I didn't know where to  find you guys, and then 92.3 put you guys on.  That was the first time I heard you again, because I couldn't get XM. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, look at that.  Oh, thank you, Larry.  So, down the hall, take note.  Yes.  Definitely are the best.  My brother thinks so, too.  So, what do you got on Britney?  I just think, like you guys were saying before, I think she will come out better than what she  is now.  Like, Drew Barrymore had, like, the same problem, running around drinking at nine years old, rehab,  and what have you.  And now, if you look at her now, you know, like, eight years later, she's, like, one  of the biggest movie stars and directors out in Hollywood.  Eight years later?  Well, Larry, a little more than eight years.  A little more than eight.  Could be. 
[01:01:30]  Believe it or not, Drew Barrymore is, I think, pushing 30 at this point.  Oh.  Well, yeah, okay.  All right, but maybe 15.  I don't know.  I think there's a point where you could get away with some of this stuff, but, like we  said, Mariah Carey did a lot of it behind the scenes, but she, yeah.  Britney's a kook, and what, you go pay to see her and just look and forget all this  stuff you saw?  Yeah.  She's, you know, dancing all sexy and stuff.  You just know behind those eyes is a nut job.  A kook.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[01:02:00]  You guys are the best.  It'll be interesting.  I can't wait to see what she does next.  I mean, I'm hooked.  Yeah.  I'm hooked on this, and I'm hooked on that Anna Nicole Smith crap.  I'll tell you that much.  I'd put her at 35.  What?  Who?  Drew Barrymore?  Drew Barrymore.  No, not even close in.  I'm sorry.  32.  She's 32?  She's 32?  You got to figure.  She was like eight or something at ET, which was like 1980, 81.  You hear how confident I was, too?  I know.  I'm thinking 28, 29. 
[01:02:30]  No.  She's 32 years old?  Yeah.  She's today?  Yesterday.  Oh, on Steve's birthday?  Her and Steve share a birthday.  Aw.  How about that?  All right.  We got a treat for you guys.  Well, for some people, and then for other people, they're going to go, ugh.  We haven't done this in a while.  We get people that love this next bit, and we get people that hate this.  Some people love this bit, and some people hate it. 
[01:03:00]  I know.  I'm looking at one of them.  You're looking at the staff, aren't you?  I hate this.  That's why our show works, because I can't get enough of Big A and Twitchels, and you  hate Twitchels.  Well, let me tell you.  I love the Big A.  I think he's very funny.  Yeah.  But that Twitchels, just something about him.  Yeah.  Just rubs me the wrong way.  Hey, this is why you've got to listen to the show longer, because we're about to play  a sound for you, and the people that were listening a little earlier, that were motivated 
[01:03:30]  enough to turn on our show, know exactly what this is, what I'm about to play.  What if you woke up?  What if your alarm was set for a little later, though?  You're assed out of luck.  That's what I say.  All right.  Now you're going to have to go to a message board or something and ask questions what  this is.  Okay.  But see, now we've got a lot of people in on the joke, because we're going to play it  again.  They're going to be laughing really hard.  Like, I can't believe I'm hearing this.  And other people are going to be like, well, what is that?  Maybe you could ask your co-workers. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Maybe they'll know.  Maybe they'll help you out.  But we're not telling you at this point.  Just play it, E-Rock.  Okay.  I'm tying the bag up.  Did you hear it?  Yeah.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Okay.  All right.  One more time.  Throw it against the window?  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Here we go. 
[01:04:30]  That last one really is the kicker, ain't it?  For you guys that have no idea what that is, you have no idea how funny that is, maybe  what we should do before we get out of here, maybe just out of nowhere we say what it is  without connecting it to the audio.  I think we can get away with that again.  Figure it out.  We'll figure something out.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading. 
[01:05:00]  Opie and Anthony!  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  And it's Friday.  Friday!  Got a lot of people in studio today.  I went down the hall to, you know, do my thing.  Do your thing.  And then I come walking back into the studio.  Yeah, huh?  Our breaks are so long, I can go down to Starbucks and get my own coffee. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  But I went down the hall, come back in the studio, and you guys are still talking about  Harry Potter.  Well, we had stopped talking about it, but then we had to start talking about it again.  Why did you have to start talking about it again?  How did it start?  Let's see.  I believe Travis came in again with just a huge stack.  The printer has to need more ink at this point.  Look at this stack of nude Harry Potter pictures.  And Sam is very upset with this. 
[01:06:00]  And we're very lucky you get to see it all today.  Oh, it's the full Monty, as they say in England, across the pond.  And he keeps handing them to Sam, who just rips them up or crumbles them.  Oh, Twitchels will probably enjoy that.  Yeah, well, we've heard things.  Harry Potter and the horse.  So why?  Why more?  I thought we destroyed all the copies.  Why are they still multiplying?  Because Sam loves the Harry Potter picture. 
[01:06:30]  He's knocking them out of Travis's hand.  And now pieces of the photo have shown up.  Keith has very generously just taped just one little piece of the photo.  If you look over here, it's just one very important part of the photo of the nude Harry Potter.  I taped it to my keyboard.  We used to grow vegetables growing up.  It looks like a carrot.  A carrot?  A plump carrot.  Just out of the ground.  Before you clean it off. 
[01:07:00]  Freshly harvested.  A fresh harvest carrot.  And what I just noticed was Sam trying to be tough.  And you know what, Sam?  You might be a tough guy.  I don't know.  I really don't know.  But he's trying to be...  He talks like he is.  He's trying to be tough like he's knocking the nude pictures out of everyone's hands.  But he's wearing a hoodie with safety pins on it.  It's the hottest hoodie on the streets.  I've heard of this before.  I understand that.  I've got to hope for all this.  I understand that.  If you're in the Bronx and, you know...  I think you can get away with it, but...  You do realize, Sam. 
[01:07:30]  I got to...  Steve just taped the nude picture to Sam's back.  And he's taking it out of his hoodie.  They got a few in there as well.  You got to realize something, Sam.  You're not built to be the smartass you are.  You're like...  It's simple like physics.  You're a smartass.  One punch, you are so down on the ground.  And not even by a big guy.  Unless he knows some of that karate.  You think?  I don't know any karate.  Any karate?  No. 
[01:08:00]  He just has the hottest hoodie on the street, so no one would screw with him.  Yeah.  You got that right.  You got that right.  Yes, sure we do.  Safety pin hoodie.  I just don't get it.  Maybe I'm finally getting old.  That's what it is.  Now that I'm a few years out of college, maybe I'm starting to lose it a little bit.  No, it sucks.  Well, there you go.  Someone of comparable age, of course.  Yeah, he's a lot younger than I, so it's good to know that it does suck.  Travis is now fanning the pictures out like a deck of cards, like you would say, pick a 
[01:08:30]  card, any card, with the nude Harry Potter pictures.  But Travis is legitimately gay.  Oh, okay.  No, he's got a girlfriend somewhere.  She lives in Canada.  She's a beard.  Usually when you say you have a girlfriend that lives in Canada, it means you're gay  and you're just covering up.  But he really does have a girlfriend.  He's not in Canada.  I'm looking at her on PalTalk right now.  She's a lovely girl.  It's weird.  Like, is it true you, like, take a bus to Montreal?  Going tonight.  Every weekend?  Every weekend. 
[01:09:00]  No, every two weeks.  Every two weeks.  And how many hours is that from New York?  Oh, that's eight hours.  That's a solid eight hours.  Eight hours on a bus.  And what kind of people are on the bus to Montreal from New York?  All gay guys going to their beards.  No, it's me and a lot of black people.  Really?  Why black people?  Black people travel by bus a lot?  Yeah.  I never knew that.  But why to Montreal, though?  Yeah, what the hell are they doing up there?  I don't know.  It's a lot of French black people.  Oh, okay.  Like Cajun people? 
[01:09:30]  I guess.  They're cooking jambalaya as you hand out Harry Potter.  Are you going to bring them on the bus with you and just hand them out to all the passengers?  Absolutely.  Hang them in the windows?  What are you doing on a bus for eight hours?  I sleep.  Get sexually assaulted.  No, I sleep.  Watch DVDs.  Play PSP now.  Wow.  And now I'm going to read a book.  Yeah, I gave him a book.  Wow.  I gave him a book.  First one ever.  Travis has shown a little interest in radio.  The rest of these guys is just kind of fun for them. 
[01:10:00]  Dude, don't fall into the BS.  Stop, please.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  He's shown a little interest.  No, he's not.  A little interest.  He's being a kiss-ass and being nice.  I went to school for it.  There is nothing worse than when someone of authority, of any type of authority, gives  you a book.  Because now you're obligated to read it and comment on it.  I didn't say it.  No, no.  He asked for it.  Because I was coming in and talking about it.  He asked for it.  You know it.  I've been coming in and talking about it.  Brown nose. 
[01:10:30]  We learned about...  I'll take Judge Smale's bag.  We learned about the good guys from WMCA.  The top 40 jocks that used to have to wear ties.  The guys that Minnelli wants us to sound like.  Yeah, probably.  Yeah.  But I would talk about what I was reading in the book.  And Travis showed an interest.  I go, well, if you want, you can have the book.  I said it to everyone.  He was the only one that said, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He will not read that book.  I absolutely will.  If you got DVDs, a PSP, and a book, what are you doing? 
[01:11:00]  I would so not read the book.  I'd pop up the DVD player with the book.  Or lean my hands on it when I'm playing PSP.  Or use it to hit a black person over the head that's trying to rape me on a bus.  I'm trying to remember the last time I was on a bus.  Thank God I don't have to do that anymore.  Last time, me, it was LA to New York City.  Yeah.  Because my father, I told the story.  My mother had sent money out to get us kids back to New York because we were, like, starving and turning into a life of crime in California living with my father. 
[01:11:30]  So she sent my father out money for airfare, which he quickly traded in the tickets for money and threw us on a Greyhound bus with criminals with $100 for the both of us to make it from LA to New York, which we promptly lost in Las Vegas and had to go from Vegas to New York without a dime.  And we were stealing food from the bums that were on the bus because they'd stop at every town.  And then bums would get on.  The pay would change.  And then they'd go to the next town and get off. 
[01:12:00]  And we would, like, rifle through their stuff when they were sleeping so we could eat and we would drink their booze.  You're a germaphobe.  How did you get away with that?  Hey, survival, my friend.  When you're in country like that.  Yeah.  When I was in the NOM, same thing.  When you're hungry, eat anything.  I was starving one day in school.  And I had the worst childhood.  Jesus Christ.  I'd go to school in California with no money, no lunch, no nothing.  And I'd just, grrr, my stomach, grrr, grrr.  Yeah, you're going to learn about math and English. 
[01:12:30]  You're really going to pay attention.  Grrr, grrr, grrr, grrr.  I was starving.  So I'm walking.  And the lockers had a space under them that was about three inches high.  And I looked and I saw a big chocolate chip cookie on the floor under the lockers.  And I thought for a little bit and looked around.  And I ate that cookie.  I picked it up and ate that cookie because I was starving.  You're a lot different now, my friend.  Oh, now forget about it.  I throw the cookie at Ethnix.  By the way, you're listening to Breezy Conversation. 
[01:13:00]  Breezy.  We're just kind of going back and forth, like, talking about bus trips and nudity, male nudity.  It's very breezy and light.  Now you know what I do?  I buy whole bags of Chips Ahoy and throw them away.  Yeah.  Because I can.  Eat a couple, throw the rest away.  That's what I do.  I throw them at the neighborhood children, the little Jewish children.  I try to knock their yarmulkes off their head with chocolate chip cookies and think about  my horrid youth.  Travis, by the way, you must really be in love because Montreal's got to be, like, minus  20 this time of year. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's pretty cold.  I got a weather report from his beard girlfriend.  Yeah.  She's not bearded.  No.  Don't say that.  She's lovely.  I don't know how you got such an attractive beard.  I don't know either.  Usually, beards are lesbians.  Yeah.  So, you know, it'd be like she'd be in flannel, maybe a little overweight or something like  that, but she's a cute blonde girl.  And then there's you.  Yeah.  Trust me right now.  He brought her around for the first time.  I think it was at one of the ONA Traveling Virus shows. 
[01:14:00]  And we're all like, stop.  What the hell?  Is that a cousin or something?  The first time I brought her up here, both Mars and Will, the sales guy, would not believe  me.  No one.  Of course.  They weren't.  We still don't believe you.  Who's the hot chick?  And I said, that's my girlfriend.  And they said, yeah, right.  Okay.  Who is she?  Yeah.  Stop it.  Yeah.  No one was buying into it, but we're very happy for it.  Cameron from Atlanta.  What's up?  Hey, you guys need to answer the question all of America is asking. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Is Harry Hong?  Is Harry Hong?  Well, from the picture, Travis is now passing.  Stop handing them out.  He just loves passing these out.  My God.  And notice no one's smelling them like we did the old dittos in school.  You're not holding these up to your face when he hands them out like the teacher.  Take one and pass it down.  Well, he could be a shower and not a grower. 
[01:15:00]  That's what they call some of these things.  It's...  But it's...  I don't have...  I really don't have an opinion.  I...  Who has an opinion on this?  Who wants to speak out and say if this is...  I'll speak out.  All right.  I laugh at that.  You laugh at that?  Yes, thank you.  That's right.  I laugh at Harry and his, uh, and his, uh, whatever.  Okay.  I laugh at it. 
[01:15:30]  All right.  I'm crumbling mine up.  You're crumbling up the tenth copy.  Throwing it at Sam's head.  And there's no way we can tell if he's hung from that picture because it's not him.  Oh, yeah.  He's insisting it's Photoshopped.  Sam has decided to study the picture all morning instead of maybe doing something that  could help the program.  He knows if it's real, he's going to have to take it home and, you know...  Yeah.  Do some...  He's going to have the urge to do some further analysis.  Right.  Some real analysis.  We're going to try to get some hair samples. 
[01:16:00]  Down to the lab.  Get it under a microscope, right?  Hey, uh, look who we have in the studio.  Oh, my God.  Boy, this is very exciting.  What a treat.  We got Big A and Twitchels.  How long has it been since you guys have been here?  Who cares?  Shut up.  What's up, Twitchels?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Wow.  You're sporting a nice new, like, bouffant hairdo.  Bouffant?  Yeah, well, it's like a little...  You got, like, kind of the...  The front thing.  It's hard to stay still in the chair, but she did her best.  Oh, was that at the Barber's County? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, that must be a treat, cutting your hair.  I wonder if you're going to be sued for stabbing you in the side of the head.  I tell them I'll wave my hand if I need them to stop when they're doing the razor.  Yeah.  And they'll let me get it out.  They'll go back in.  Twitchels has very bad Tourette's.  Yeah.  Very bad.  He was featured on MTV.  I have Tourette's, I guess it was called.  True life, I have Tourette's.  Oh, gives a crap what it was called.  There you go.  I have Tourette's.  That's what I called it.  Same difference.  I called it freak show.  I got to tell you, for a moment, I almost felt sorry for you. 
[01:17:00]  Just for a moment.  Oh, my God.  For you?  I felt sorry for you, but it had nothing to do with the goddamn Tourette's whatsoever.  It was the way you live your life.  Well, you...  Holy Jesus.  I heard that you thought I had a bad relationship with my dad or something.  Well, it looked like your dad and you didn't have a good relationship.  The half hug thing?  Maybe it's the editing.  Yeah.  The half hug thing?  The half hug thing.  Yeah, there was no real warmth.  There was no real warmth or anything in that hug.  My dad's very supportive.  I love my dad.  He feels upset sometimes because he's a Vietnam vet and he got post-traumatic stress because  he was sprayed with Agent Orange.  And that's really the only thing they can link to possibly why I would have the disorder 
[01:17:30]  since there's no trace of it in my family.  Oh, wow.  And they've done a lot of studies.  Oh, wow.  So he's got like that burden thing.  And I said, look, it's not your fault.  I don't have what I have.  You know what?  You should take advantage of the burden thing, though, and get whatever you want.  That's what I would do.  I'd be driving a brand new car.  I'd have a nice condo somewhere.  I would have him buying me girls because you're not getting them on your own.  How many people did he kill?  At least he got that to make you feel better.  Does he have the ears, the teeth?  A collection of ears.  What does he got?  Who my dad?  They used to call the Vietnamese gooks back then. 
[01:18:00]  I don't know how to really describe my dad.  I mean, Big Cat met my dad a few times.  He's a character.  Yeah.  He's a good guy.  Do you ever tell you any war stories?  You ever ask him?  Did he kill anyone over there?  Or was he like, you know, the head of the motor pool?  He likes to say he shot at people.  He doesn't like to think if he hit anyone or not.  He doesn't know if he ever killed anyone.  That's what I do out my window, too.  You just take some pot shots.  I don't know if I'm hitting anyone.  Read the paper the next day and go, bah.  It was fun.  But so you're saying he might have killed people. 
[01:18:30]  He might have.  He has post-traumatic stress really bad.  Like, he can't go into movies.  He can't go to movies.  I can't either.  Why can't he go into movies?  Just for the reasons we have.  Just black people that keep yelling, and I'm too afraid to tell them to shut up.  Maybe I got that.  I went and saw Babel.  I got a real problem, and I want to talk to an expert about it.  I can't sit in a movie theater and listen to people eat.  Oh, the crunching of the popcorn during the quiet part of a movie.  My girlfriend actually sees that I'm losing my mind, and she has to kind of almost like 
[01:19:00]  calm you down.  Yeah, calm you down.  Go, it's going to be okay.  It's going to be okay.  When it gets silent, just before the movie, I've talked about this many times, and everyone  is just eating their popcorn, and it just sounds like locusts, and the candy and everything  has to happen.  Opening up their Twizzlers.  You would think in the year 2007 we would get better packaging so you don't have to hear  all that crap.  You would think in the year 2007 that people would burn your CDs so you could watch them  at home.  Right, exactly.  Oh, damn it.  Did I say that on mic?  Oops.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:19:30]  You might have.  All right.  I go to the movies every time I'm supposed to.  But the packaging, and usually the beginning of every movie is pretty much the best part  is they're setting everything up, and all you hear is people opening up packaging and  just munching and munching because we're just needy.  How do you feel about it?  Humans are just needy and wanting and have to just feed our faces.  Just keep feeding, grazing, because you're at a movie and you're obligated.  And I need to know why it bothers me more than the average person.  It gets me crazy. 
[01:20:00]  Movie?  Too stressful for me, too.  Different reason, but too stressful.  I can't go to the movies.  I get all stressed out the second I sit, whether some big tall guy is going to sit in front  of me.  Everyone that walks in I see as a potential problem to me enjoying this movie.  If I see kids walk in, I go, here we go.  Cell phones ringing and yapping.  I see a bunch of black guys walk in, I go, here it goes, yapping that you can't tell  them to shut up.  At least the kids can turn around and go, hey, quiet.  Because you can take the kid. 
[01:20:30]  But you're right.  That's what it's all about.  I'll beat the crap out of the kid.  The reality is we talk back to people we just know we can take out.  Black people, scared of them in movie theaters.  I won't say a word to them.  They could talk.  They could get up.  They could go right in my face and turn around in the seat and stare at me and block my view.  And I'll just sit there.  Hum-dee-dee-dee-da.  Hum-dee-dee.  Could you just tell me what's happening?  I'm that petrified.  Too much stress in the movies.  But if it's a little nerdy kid, you're right in their face.  Hey, quiet down.  What's your take on talking during the trailer? 
[01:21:00]  Because people now, you give a thumbs up to talking during, I want everyone to shut up  right when the trailer starts.  I don't care about the Coke commercial.  The commercial's fine.  Yap away.  But the second the trailers start, I kind of shut up.  Hold on.  Hold on there.  Fan, you're up.  Point counterpoint with Fan.  Yes.  I like this.  I think if the trailer is worth making fun of, if it's something where it's like, I 
[01:21:30]  don't have to give the person next to me a high five and says, that looks awesome.  But if it's something stupid, like I saw the holiday with Jack Black and stuff, and it  looked really stupid.  Okay.  I commented about how.  You commented about how.  During the trailer?  As it wrapped up.  Or right when it wrapped up and it's all quiet.  And I was shushed, and I told him to mind his business.  Oh, because you were shushed.  See, that's why.  I knew there was a personal reason for this.  And the reason Dan said that is because he knows that karate.  Yeah.  He knows the karate.  He could kick some ass.  Yeah, he could kick some ass. 
[01:22:00]  But the noises in the theater as everyone's munching down.  Yeah, the noises, it's just ruining the experience.  It hits me deep, deep down.  I go almost nuts.  I go almost Britney.  I'm looking for an umbrella.  Oh, you're shaving your head in the theater.  You're throwing your hair at people.  Where were we?  So Vietnam, Tourette's.  Agent Orange.  Agent Orange.  And it leaves you a twitching mess.  That true life, they show it all the time.  And I'm like, I don't want to feel sorry for you, Twitchels.  I don't want to do it.  But it wasn't the Tourette's.  It was his life.  You live in the basement. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, and they focused on the date.  That was like the big thing.  How disastrous it went.  Him going on a date.  It was supposed to be about his Tourette's and how he handles life with Tourette's.  But even if he didn't have Tourette's and you led this type of lifestyle, I would look  and feel sorry for you.  It's in the basement.  You have Broadway show posters all over your basement room.  Which leads me to believe you need a picture that I believe Travis could hand you.  Harry Potter picture.  Oh, here comes Travis again with the pictures.  He loves it.  Oh, Big A's got one to give you. 
[01:23:00]  There you go.  I'm a theater major.  I love Broadway shows and stuff.  A theater major.  I know.  The Wizard of Oz was hanging up in his little basement apartment.  And then he goes out on a date and just completely strikes out with this girl.  You just did everything wrong.  And I asked her.  I talked to her a couple of days afterwards.  I'm like, you know, I'm sorry for spilling the water on you.  I'm sorry for.  That was a good.  It's a little twitch and spills the water on you.  She was like, look, it just, you know, we'll just stick friends. 
[01:23:30]  Stick to be friends.  Yeah.  Stick to be friends.  And can we be friends that never call each other?  And that's not BS.  She went on the date because she knew MTV was filming.  And that's all.  You know that.  Yeah.  Of course.  She had no interest in you there.  And then they had that other chick that was kind of cute.  The little girl from, what was she?  A little high school girl or something.  When I was screaming, you had bumps in her hair.  And she was a mess.  I mean, she couldn't stay still for a second.  And she'd be like screaming.  Wah!  Wah!  How great was MTV to make sure they got a shot of her trying to put mascara on? 
[01:24:00]  Oh, trying to put mascara on?  They're a sick asshole there.  How tense was that to watch?  Oh, my God.  I was on the edge of my seat like waiting for her eyeball to just be plucked out of her head.  It was fantastic.  Her mom, her grandma trying to put her toenail polish on for her and she's screaming at her.  She's screaming at her grandmother, poor grandmother, this old woman trying to put nail polish on a paint shaker.  And then they put some electrodes in her head.  And then when they flip the switch, you're hoping, you're just hoping against all hope for this poor girl that it's going to be like a switch. 
[01:24:30]  Because she had to be conscious during this operation where they put these nails in your head.  And they have like a little space, a little gap, like a spark plug for an arc or something that goes on in your head.  It's an electrode.  It's almost like a light dimmer.  You know this little button where you go, you dim it up, dim it down.  They do that.  And when you dim it up, the ticks get worse.  And that's the way it's supposed to work.  And when you dim it down, the ticks go down.  So it's supposed to adjust the whole thing.  You've had it done?  No, not me.  That's a big operation.  I don't think I have it that severe, at least at this point, to have someone to be willing to have a doctor cut my brain off. 
[01:25:00]  Dude, she was awake.  She's awake during this.  And they're putting the nails in her head.  And it didn't work.  And then they give her little things and she starts twitching to see if they're in the right position.  And then after a while, they give her the little control box that she wears.  And they turn it up and program her and everything.  And it doesn't even work.  She's still a screaming mess.  They said it could take up to like six months.  But right now, from what I hear, it's not working.  So what's going to happen with you?  Will this get worse? 
[01:25:30]  Better?  You know, there's good days.  Maybe hoping for a new drug.  You know, I'm not willing to get back on the medicine.  I don't want to gain that weight back.  And you can't be sleeping six to eight hours a night.  No, I have a lot of problems with sleep.  I mean, you know, I get to bed around four or five every day.  I wake up around 12 or one.  You know, I got bags under my eyes all the time.  I'm not feeling great.  But I can't feel bad for myself.  I'm keeping busy and doing stuff.  It's an empty thing.  MTV thing opened a lot of doors.  I just booked a pilot with MTV Asia. 
[01:26:00]  Oh.  They must love you over there.  Look at his girl.  All I got to say.  That's amazing.  You're a twitcher twitchers.  They're going to make a monster movie out of you.  It was twitchers.  Yeah.  Okay, now you're a twitcher building.  Twitchzilla.  It shoots tomorrow in the city.  It's TV Asia.  It's about this Asian pop star.  She was a pop star when she was 15.  Sue B. Chang.  She moves to New York City and tries to make it.  And they follow her life.  It's like a reality-based sitcom. 
[01:26:30]  It looks like reality, but it's scripted.  That's terrific.  And I'm one of her friends that she meets.  I play a comic named Tony.  And hopefully gets picked up.  Hey, we got to take a break.  That's exciting news.  Big A, what's up?  I'm sure your father loves the idea of MTV Asia.  Yeah.  Does he want to just machine gun down your cast?  I have traumatic stress, and you made my son jump like a jumping bean, you bastards.  Just mows down the cast of your crappy show.  What's up, Big A? 
[01:27:00]  Great.  We'll be back after these words.  For the new listeners.  Oh, what the F are you doing?  We're live, continuing the show on XM Radio.  I never throw it to commercial.  Visit XM Radio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  During the break, we were watching the news, the local news.  They got Rat Cam today.  Rat Cam.  Great story here in New York.  What is it, like a fast food restaurant? 
[01:27:30]  We're not sure which one.  Or a couple of those combined fast food restaurants.  That's a new thing to do these days.  Yeah.  And, I don't know, there was some kind of disruption, because that's what happens when  you see lots and lots of rats.  I was telling Anthony, more rats in New York City than people, but they know how to survive  and know how to hide and live somewhere else in general.  Every once in a while, you'll see one running across the sidewalk, or if you're down the  subways, you see them a lot in the tracks when the trains aren't going by.  But in general, they're hiding behind the walls and under the sidewalks and all that. 
[01:28:00]  But then, like, some kind of construction project or something happens, and it disrupts  the rats, and then they just kind of do some wilding for a while.  Well, this place that they showed, this food establishment that didn't seem to be in the  nicest of neighborhoods by the people they were interviewing, was infested with rats.  They were just showing rat after rat running into this joint, and they did what they call  the stand-up shot in front of the place. 
[01:28:30]  And the news, being what it is, absolutely did this on purpose.  The stand-up was done with the neon sign for the phone number of the restaurant in question.  It says, we deliver, and it had the phone number of the place.  And you know they did that just so this place gets flooded with phone calls.  They could have set that shot up anywhere.  Just like everyone else, we try calling.  It's busy.  Is it busy?  But the rat cam is unbelievable.  They're showing just a lot of rats. 
[01:29:00]  Swarms of rats are going into this place.  Just climbing on stuff.  And they're on the tile floor inside the kitchen, I guess.  Yeah.  And they're just crawling around all the equipment, the little table that they use to pound out  whatever kind of gruel they make.  Yeah, the most awful neighborhood.  The most you'll ever see is a water main break.  When I tell you thousands upon thousands of rats I've seen at water main breaks when you go.  Oh, really?  Especially at night.  They're just absolutely everywhere.  You can look into a store and you can't even see the floor.  That's how many of them come from the basements and everything when the water gets in. 
[01:29:30]  Right.  So if the water starts flooding the basement, they come out of their hiding space, run up  the stairs or whatever, and then they're inside the building.  Yeah, that's when you see them because they're just everywhere.  I read a great book on just rats.  It's called Rats, I believe.  Travis has asked for that one for his bus ride up.  He's going to read two books.  Hey, Travis, you want the right book next?  DVD player.  Two thumbs up.  I'm going to kiss ass.  He's got his DVD player, his PSP, and a book Opie gave him, yet he's going to read the book. 
[01:30:00]  It's an eight-hour trip.  What movies did he bring, I wonder?  Oh, I'm not going to watch them.  You know, someone in Philly brings up a great point.  Justin, going back a little bit, I was talking about how I can't stand people eating in movie  theaters, and someone said squeaky popcorn really drives them nuts in movie theaters  and all that.  And Justin from Philly, you're right, Justin.  He's calling me all sorts of names I can't say over here.  And then he writes, you're complaining about food noises, Mr. Effing Yogurt Spoon Noise  and Cheerio Eating blank blank. 
[01:30:30]  So we eat on the air a little bit.  I guess he's right.  We have to pick the time we can eat.  It's very difficult.  We have to entertain America.  We don't have time to eat.  We have to do it on the air.  Look at me.  I have a lovely piece of cantaloupe stuck on the end of this fork that I can't eat.  You want to.  There you go.  I'm eating it.  All right.  It's time for the news with Big A and Twitchels.  For the new listeners.  Oh, wait.  Yeah, there was one other thing I want to do.  I want to punish the casual listener of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:31:00]  All righty.  There's a lot of people out there listening right now.  They're in on the joke.  Know why?  Because they love the show to the point they try to catch as much as humanly possible.  And then you got the casual listeners like, yeah, I guess I'll turn them on now.  See what they're up to.  They were there when their alarm went off at six.  That's right.  What did they wake up to?  Opie and Anthony.  That's right.  When they're getting ready in the bathroom.  Hey, throw on the radio in there.  O and A.  Right.  They're getting into their car, going to work.  What's on?  O and A.  I'm trying to get people to listen longer.  Linger longer. 
[01:31:30]  What a doodle.  Please linger longer.  It's very important to the success of our show that we get people to linger longer.  Linger longer.  We explained something and then we played the sound.  So now people are in on the joke.  And then there's people out there, unfortunately, you're not in on the joke.  All we'll even say is that it's a woman.  You can tell by the clip.  Yeah.  It's a woman.  Yeah.  That's all we'll give you.  She has a bag.  That's all we'll give you. 
[01:32:00]  And she throws it against a window.  Yeah.  And if you were lingering longer, you know exactly what this is.  Yeah.  But you didn't.  Now, did you?  You had to get the kids ready for school's out this week.  Although you're not giving people a lot of credit.  Why?  Because a lot of people are saying that is an unmistakable thud.  Yeah, but what is the thud, though?  Exactly.  Yeah, play it again real fast.  It's quick.  Okay, I'm tying the bag up.  Did you hear it? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Okay.  All right.  One more time.  Throw it against the window?  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Here we go.  There you go.  Thud.  We explained what that was, but you weren't around for the explanation.  I'm sorry.  Sucks to be you today.  Big A and Twitzels, we're ready for the news. 
[01:33:00]  So for the new listeners, Big A, he's just, you're a mess in your own right.  Let's be honest.  But we love you, Big A.  Big A is a cab driver.  Yeah.  Not one of these yellow cabs that you see driving around New York City.  That are well protected, by the way, with the partition.  Bulletproof glass and all this.  Big A is a lunatic.  He will drive a cab.  I don't even know what it is.  It's like a broken down car.  And he'll drive it with no protection whatsoever.  And where do you drive? 
[01:33:30]  The base is in Boston.  In the Bronx.  In the Bronx.  Everyone in the United States knows about the Bronx.  You don't even have to explain it to people.  Unless I have to adjust my retinas here, I do believe we're looking at a white man.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  And he's like, you know.  A white cab driver in the Bronx.  He's like De Niro in taxi driving.  Anytime, anywhere.  Right.  No partition.  You go up to Harlem.  Anytime, anywhere.  And how many hours? 
[01:34:00]  What are your hours, I mean?  You got the weird hours, too, right?  About 10, 12 hours.  About 6 in the morning to about 6 at night.  Okay.  Okay, daylight.  Yeah, a little safe.  Sometimes the zombies don't come out at that hour.  That's still, ooh.  That's rough.  All right.  And if you haven't noticed, I don't know, I have to point this out to people because maybe  some people didn't notice.  The makeover?  He has a bit of a speech impediment.  Oh.  It seems to be a little bit of a problem. 
[01:34:30]  I kind of was looking at the makeover.  He's looking like Fonzie.  More and more like Fonzie every day.  Wow.  He's even got the leather jacket.  Hey.  You know what Ron and Fez called?  Big A.  Yeah.  Hey.  You showing up at the Ron and Fez event tonight?  Yes, I'll be there.  Of course you are.  I'll be there.  Hard Rock Cafe tonight with Ron and Fez and the gang?  I'm showing up, absolutely.  I'll be in Atlantic City.  I'll be there.  Aw, damn.  And I wanted to go tonight.  I'll represent the show, bro.  All right.  Representing.  Representing. 
[01:35:00]  Is that right?  So Big A has a speech impediment, and here's the key.  He can't say S-T words.  Yeah, the S-T words, for some reason, are very hard for him to say.  Everything's kind of hard for him.  He does this thing, and the S-T's just don't want to make their way out.  So they do the news.  Yeah.  And our news writers here on staff, for some reason, I think they...  By the way, which alcoholic is the news writer for the Opie and Anthony show? 
[01:35:30]  That would be Danny.  Danny, okay.  Which alcoholic?  Well, you could just say alcoholic.  I said which one, though?  Alcoholics, gay guy, you know, half a Negro.  There's plenty of...  And genius.  That's right.  We got bi-curious alcoholics working on the Opie and Anthony show.  Because Steve interviewed everybody.  Yes.  And he likes both those things.  Of course he does. 
[01:36:00]  He loves his alcohol, and he loves his bi-curiosity.  Are you curious about radio?  Like when he sees that their face gets a little panicky.  Are you curious about learning about broadcasting?  That's what I meant.  But if they show an inkling of a twinkle in their eye, he's like, curious?  Hmm.  Okay.  Let me have your cell number.  I'll be in touch later.  Do you like poppers?  I don't mean the food kind either.  All right.  So Twitchell's with his Tourette's and Big A with his speech impediment. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Definitely listen for the ST words.  They do the news from time to time.  We have a news writer.  Sprinkle those in quite liberally.  Yeah.  So why don't you guys take it from here?  It's Big A and Twitchell's with the news.  Good morning.  It's time for the news.  I'm Big A.  And I'm Louis Twitchell Santani.  I'm reading from the script. 
[01:37:00]  I know and I hate it.  We hate that.  Oh, do I hate the Louis Twitchell Santani moniker.  Doing what I'm told.  Good boy.  All right.  Big A's got the first story.  The brilliance of this, by the way, that I have found since we've started this bit,  Big A, it takes it forever to say the ST words.  Yeah.  And that drives Twitchell's nuts to the point you get some unbelievable noises out of him.  Yeah.  He can't stand the delay in Big A's delivery. 
[01:37:30]  So he's sitting over there twitching like a maniac.  Trying to keep calm.  And Big A, believe me, if you hear dead silence, it is not your radio.  Nothing is broken.  We haven't finally reached a point where we have nothing left to say.  It is Big A really trying to get a word out.  Yeah.  It takes that long.  What kills me is when you say, start over, do it again.  Yeah, yeah.  And I have to go through it again.  All right.  Here we go.  Big A, go ahead.  Your first story.  He has officially begun.  Starting next on our Britney Spears. 
[01:38:00]  She's purportedly attempting another STINT in rehab in attempts to restore her sanity after her astonishing behavior at ex-husband Kevin Fairline's house. 
[01:38:30]  Last week, the star beat us. 
[01:39:00]  A strong profession statement and stiled her head bold.  Oh, God, I can't take this.  Oh, I can't take it, though. 
[01:39:30]  I stopped breathing.  I know.  I actually stopped breathing.  It is difficult.  I hold my breath when he's doing that for some reason.  My favorite line, the steamed starlet.  Steamed starlet, yeah.  Oh, did that hurt.  Dennis Johnson, the star NBA guard who was part of three championships and teamed with Larry Bird on one of the great postseason plays, died Thursday.  Collapsing after his developmental team's practice, paramedics tried to resuscitate him for 23 minutes before he was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead.

[01:55:00]  On the Opie and Anthony show  Yes we  What an educational program  They're starting to call already  But here's the rat story  We were talking about  We got the audio  Alright if you're eating your breakfast right now  Look away  There is a repulsive sight  In the village right now  Where rats apparently  Are crawling all over  A fast food restaurant  This video  Shot just a few hours ago  At the KFC  On 6th Avenue  And West 4th Street  Done  You can see a bunch of rats  Scaring all over the floor  Like they own the place  Climbing up on trash cans  Even tables  According to the Department of Health  The KFC was cited  For having rats in the restaurant  Just three months ago 
[01:55:30]  We're seeing a crew there right now  And next hour  We'll tell you  If the rats are still there  Look at all those rats  That's disgusting  Wow  Wow  Yeah  So that's what we were  Taking a peek at earlier  Yeah the swarms of rats  Yeah  Alright and  The wee thing  Anna Nicole Smith  Well the Anna Nicole Smith thing  Is really good  Because the judge broke down  The judge  That tough guy judge  He's a whack job  He's from I guess  The Bronx  Or Brooklyn  He's a New Yorker  Started out as a cab driver 
[01:56:00]  To put himself through school  To become a lawyer  Yeah  And then became a judge  And he kind of  Wants the publicity  I think  He wants his own TV show  What he's gunning for  He was showboating  This year it should have  Taken an hour  He decided to take up  Three or four of our days  Around the clock coverage  And really getting into it  He's asking Howard K. Stern  When was the first time  He had sex with Anna Nicole  He wanted to know all about it  He wanted all the controversial  Questions answered  I'm sitting there thinking  What does this have to do 
[01:56:30]  About her  With her  You know  Rotting corpse  Rotting body  And where it's going to be buried  Make a god damn decision  And shut your gap  Time is of the essence  Exactly  She's rotting  So it came out that he  Actually had an audition tape  For one of those judge shows  So he's definitely showboating  And he's auditioning for everybody  But he came off like the tough guy  Because he was kind of  Like you pointed out  He'd lay back in his seat  He wouldn't even sit up  In his chair like a judge  He'd lay back in his seat  And just kind of 
[01:57:00]  Remember when like  Captain Kirk would feel comfy  In his chair  On the bridge  When everything's good  Just going good  At the end of an episode  And he'd kind of lay back  And just go  Eh  Sulu  Warp factor one  I don't even care  Where we're going  And his arm is kind of  Over the back  His one arm is on his leg  And he's just  That shows you're  I don't care  That shows you're in control  Yeah you're just in control  People look at you  And go  This guy is not tense  He knows what he's doing 
[01:57:30]  I think that's how  We have to do our radio show  For now  Just lean  Let me get in the  We're so good  We don't even have to  Sit up  Look at us  And then you just  Got to kind of talk  Down to everybody  Yeah that's what  Relax  That's what it is  Relax Tex  Any question anyone  Ask you is stupid  Yeah  What do you think  What do you think  Don't waste my time  Look it up  Moron  Look look  My arm's over the back  Of the chair  My one leg is straight  I'm leaning back  I'm almost falling over  I'm almost falling out  Of my chair  I'm so pompous 
[01:58:00]  And smug  Well yesterday  When he rendered  His decision  Yeah  He started to cry  Yeah he breaks up  After that whole thing  Of the tough guy image  He loses it  He doesn't know  Any of these people  He doesn't know  Nicole Smith  And her rotting corpse  Nothing  But all of a sudden  He's like  I want her buried  In the Caribbean  Why?  I think this thought  He thought this was  A good ending  For the show  Right right  This was like  A show for him  And it had  The beginning  The middle  The dynamic 
[01:58:30]  And a good ending  The big reveal  Is him crying  The big reveal  And then roll credits  We're done  Bury the bitch  It's over  Give me my show  That's exactly  What this guy did  He scripted  This whole thing out  Hey they got me hooked  I was watching  Yeah  Who wasn't  Here's crying judge  As a guardian  Item for Daniel Lynn  Hope  Marshall Stern  Is awarded custody  Of the remains  Of Anna  Nicole Smith  The Browley County

[02:10:00]  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country. 
[02:10:30]  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe. 
[02:11:00]  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of town all PM. 
[02:11:30]  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.

We have all of our news stories that we usually have every day.  All nice and piled up in front of us.  And on top of the stack was just a picture of Harry Potter's cock. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  And so I showed it to the PalTuck camera.  Crumbled it up and threw it at the camera.  By the time it hit the floor, Travis had already placed another one exactly on top of the pile.  They can never go away.  One is now hanging up in the studio next to a picture of Jim Norton and a fan.  Who is that?  Wow.  A fan.  Geez.  You're that much taller than Jimmy?  And who's that in the street? 
[02:13:00]  Master Poe stopping the car so he can cross the street.  Sam's old hair.  Sam's old hair.  And Harry Potter's new hair.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sam's old hair looks like Harry Potter's cock picture.  Yeah.  Very hairy.  Very hairy there.  You look like an unclipped cock.  My favorite is Master Poe just staring at the traffic.  That's what red lights are for.  Master Poe.  He's just in the middle of traffic stopping cars so we can walk across. 
[02:13:30]  There's no problem with just waiting for a red light.  Gentlemen, red light, green light, one, two, three.  Red light, green light, one, two, three.  I think we're going back to the old ecstasy of gold starting Monday.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Got a Metallica one kind of.  It's all right.  I do believe it sucks, eh?  I think your brother's doing a version.  Joe's doing a version.  He's working on one.  He goes, he asked who did that.  He goes, because it kind of sucks.  I said, it's Metallica.  He goes, oh.  I thought it was just, you know, some listener sent it in. 
[02:14:00]  And he goes, I'll do one.  He goes, two weeks.  I'll have it done.  And we'll see.  Yeah.  Joe's pretty handy on the guitar.  Yeah.  And it might start a new thing where we get some guitar heroes to do their version.  Oh, yeah.  Why not?  Yeah.  We'll give you some nice exposure on this fine radio show.  All right.  There you go.  Yeah.  More new freaking Harry Potter.  Pictures waiting for us.  I think we're going to do another newscast with Big A and Twitch.  Because you never know when we can get these two together. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, I know.  So we'll do another newscast.  Because now Big A, for some reason, is too busy to hang with us.  But he has plenty of time to be on the Ron and Fez show.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's all about air time with these guys.  We have them on.  We get them on.  We degrade them and kick them out.  Stupid me.  I thought there was something called loyalty.  But I guess there's not.  Half the time, I leave this building after our show.  And I see, like, our crew waiting to get on Ron and Fez.  Because we haven't given them enough time.  They want the air time.  Well, sometimes I'll see Stalker Packer. 
[02:15:00]  I'm like, what are you doing here?  I'm here for Ron and Fez.  I was like, what?  But yeah, I'm going to be on this show.  And we love those guys.  They can do whatever they want.  I have no problem with them having our guys on their show.  But I have a problem with our guys.  And they're sneaky about it, hoping that they don't cross paths with us as we're leaving.  He was going to, Big A was actually going to ask us permission.  But it just would have taken all fucking day.  I think he even started one day. 
[02:15:30]  Do you mind if...  Shut the fuck up, I told him.  And I left.  Just do what you want.  Do whatever you want.  Just shut up.  Big A.  Big A.  Because now he's Big A.  He's the cool guy now.  See, what it is is the way we treat people.  See, we treat our staff well and our guests like shit.  Yeah.  Now, Ron and Fez treat their guests well and their staff like shit. 
[02:16:00]  The staff can't leave.  See?  They're kind of stuck.  The guests can leave, which they do in droves from this program.  They run like the rats that we saw at the restaurant.  At the KFC.  At the KFC.  Yeah.  Big A, what happened?  How did you make this transition from being pretty regular and known for being on our program  over to the Ron and Fez show?  One day, after the ONA show, I happened to be watching the show, and Ron told me to come 
[02:16:30]  in the last break, and he began doing...  Ow.  Oh, sorry.  No, that hurt me.  It hurt me just listening to that.  That was a hard one.  Wait, so what happened?  That was a rough one.  Can you start over? 
[02:17:00]  I really...  I lost it somewhere.  Did you just phase out?  I really did.  Just zoned out on you.  I was really trying to concentrate that time.  It's hard to.  It's hard to be a good listener in general, but to try to listen to this...  Oh.  I wasn't listening.  All right.  Start over.  What happened?  Yeah.  What happened?  One day, after the ONA show, I think it was when they changed over the virus,  I was watching the Ron and Fez show, and Ronnie told me to come in and do the last break with 
[02:17:30]  them.  Focus, focus.  You had a pirate.  I'm still there.  I'm still there.  Go ahead.  And they called me Big A, and I'm the coolest.  Bluebird.  Oh.  Damn it.  Wow.  I nodded out.  What happened?  He called you what?  Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  And the coolest.  Yeah, the coolest.  So you went from being somebody who we kind of goofed on on the show. 
[02:18:00]  We got to admit, we did treat you a little harshly and goofed on you a lot, to being the  cool guy.  Yes.  See, now, with the ONA show, you're the guy that's sitting alone at the table eating lunch,  looking at the cool table, going, God, I'd like to sit over there.  And now, the Ron and Fez school, when you change schools, you go to the Ron and Fez school,  you're sitting at the cool guy table going, A, and everyone's coming around going, Big  A, in the hallways.  They like you. 
[02:18:30]  They're your friends.  And here, we're throwing shit at you from our table.  You get to sit in the back of the bus.  Yeah.  On our show, you're in the front of the bus, and we're pegging you.  You're in the front because you got to tell the bus driver, they're hitting me with  spit wads.  And there, on the Ron and Fez bus, you're in the back, smoking butts.  Hey, Big A, you got a cigarette?  Yeah, sure.  Big A's always got a biggie.  He's always got the smokes.  He's the cool guy.  Yeah, but I'll be honest with you, I'm always loyal to you guys. 
[02:19:00]  I mean, I was on ONA for anything else.  And I'm always loyal to ONA.  Well, let's see how loyal you are.  Can we beat you with a stick today?  Just one stick.  Find me a stick.  Poe's got them.  Poe's got those fighting sticks.  What do we got?  Not the fucking...  You know, E-Rock, you are a fucking cruel individual.  Anytime any type of thing we bring up that says we want to kind of smack someone with 
[02:19:30]  something, he brings up that fucking cricket bat, that would kill somebody.  The fraternity pad.  It would absolutely...  The only time we'll ever use that is on you, dummy.  That's the only time.  You keep pulling it out, and you're the only one we think of using it on.  Look, it's a giant piece of wood.  I don't know.  It's sort of a totemistic thing.  Holy cow.  Oh, we got to make it.  In the topsy-turvy world of rock and roll.  All right.  Can we get a bunch of the guys that just kind of hit you with sticks and say, two damage, 
[02:20:00]  two damage?  Because I think...  We wanted you to show your loyalty today.  I think because of his disloyalty.  Yeah.  And like we said, I love Ron and Fez.  Love the fact that you're the cool guy on Ron and Fez.  How was I disloyal?  But we finally...  But no, you were a little disloyal.  And how was I disloyal?  Little bit.  Little bit.  Little bit.  Little bit.  Little bit.  Little bit.  I think you need, like, a Singapore-style caning.  And we have...  We're finally confronting you on your disloyalty. 
[02:20:30]  And this doesn't change things.  You could still be Big A.  Big A.  Hey, you're still cool on Ron and Fez.  You're on the Ron and Fez bus.  Oh, you're in the Ron and Fez cafeteria.  You're the cool guy.  Yeah.  But now you're back in the O&A cafeteria on the O&A bus, on the O&A.  And you're not Big A.  You're kind of...  We want to hit you with something.  You can either take a bare-bottom spanking...  Bare-bottom spanking?  Would you stop with the bare...  Here, there's a picture you might want to see.  You can take a bare-bottom spanking from Iraq, which is very dangerous. 
[02:21:00]  Or you could get hit by one, two, three, four, five sticks.  Five sticks will just kind of whack you a little bit.  You know, beat you around the fatter areas that could soak it up a little bit.  Nothing on your head.  Don't worry.  Or your balls.  You can even pick the five guys you want hitting you.  And honestly, I'm out.  And Ant's out.  Yeah.  We don't participate.  Although I'd like to.  I won't beat you.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  Sam raised his hand, and he's like, no, no. 
[02:21:30]  Sam is vicious.  And we will tell the guys not to, like, really hurt you.  Yeah, just a sound little thrashing.  Right.  With some sticks.  We want to beat you into the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, you've got to be beat back in.  This is like a gang.  We're like the Crips.  Yeah.  What do you say?  Okay.  All right.  He's willing to be beat back into the show.  What kind of sticks do we have, Master Poe?  Why don't you name everything you've got in front of you?  Jesus.  Half these things don't even look legal.  All right.  We have a Japanese shanai, and it's made out of bamboo. 
[02:22:00]  When you hit something, you hear that sound?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, well.  Nice.  All right.  Where do you get it?  Uh-oh.  Well, we need his music.  Nothing's gonna ever keep you down.  You're my best.  Oh, now.  Come on.  Nothing's gonna ever keep you down.  You're my best.  All right.  Where do you suggest he gets hit with that?  I'd say right across the chest.  Wow.  Are you serious?  Maybe the...  Why the chest?  Right here across the bicep.  Oh, so it hits like his arms. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And maybe some pecs, if they were there.  I think there's muscle there.  Somewhere there.  All right.  What about the sides?  Paul, why don't you give him a tap with that, where it doesn't hurt, but it's impressive.  And it gives us a little demonstration.  Just for the person that's gonna have this stick.  By the way, and then camera on.  I think you gotta turn the camera a little bit.  And then Big A...  Big A, step out a little bit from your corner there.  Big A.  That's very scary.  Master Paul will show you how that weapon is used, and then you, in turn, decide who you 
[02:23:00]  want to hold that weapon in the beating.  All right.  That's good.  We get a demonstration from professional, and then he gets to see...  All right.  Master Paul, like I said, do not hurt him.  Just make it kind of impressive.  He's gotta understand, you know, this type of action.  Yeah.  Wait till you see what we do to Patty when she comes in here.  Well, we get real facial.  Ass fucking?  Yeah.  What I want to do is, I want to be able to have the shenanigans closer.  Oh, Sam.  All right.  Start grandstanding.  Jesus.  That's a stupid radio bit for you.  I mean, come on. 
[02:23:30]  I mean...  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Breathe out when you get hit.  All right.  Breathe out.  Here we go.  All right.  Wait.  Shh.  That's a lie.  He got a hit and then just went...  Breathe out.  Did it hurt?  Did it hurt, Big A?  Yes, it did.  You can hit me if you want, right?  But you have to breathe out.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Master.  All right.  That's a good one.  Now, that stick might... 
[02:24:00]  Hold on.  No.  That one hurts.  Big A, who do you want to wield that stick?  Now that you know how it's used.  You can pick anyone you want.  You can hear or...  Anywhere.  Anywhere in the world.  You can turn around.  We got a whole room full.  We have 30 guys here.  We got guys out there.  You can use Twitchels.  Whatever you want.  Twitchels.  Keep the Cop.  Big Kev.  My brother.  What do you got?  What do you got?  Oh.  Steve.  Steve.  What is this?  Can I strap it on first? 
[02:24:30]  All right, Elmo.  All right, Elmo.  Elmo.  You get the bamboo sword.  Can I treat him like a stuttering pinata?  I don't think he has a choice.  All right.  All right.  Master Paul, the next stick.  What is that?  A little piece of bamboo.  What?  That's last.  All right.  Here we have a bastard sword.  And it's a little bit harder.  This is more durable.  If I hit him with this, with the edge, I'm going to break something.  I'll hit him with the flat edge.  A bastard sword. 
[02:25:00]  Bastard sword.  You know...  Could you use an asshole sword?  I think that sword should just be used to kind of poke at his penis.  You want to poke...  You know, we can't have...  Jesus.  I thought you were going to say his ass or his belly or something.  No.  Poke at his penis.  At the pubis.  So you want a little jabbing?  Just a little jabbing.  It's got to be done in an area that won't really...  I was thinking more his gut.  His gut?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Poke at his gut.  If he gets hit in the nuts with that... 
[02:25:30]  We're going to help you...  Poke him in the gut a little.  Yeah.  It doesn't have to be a fucking...  Nice and light.  Yeah.  Nice and light.  Just a little poke like you would do with your finger, but only with the bastard sword.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  The sword of the bastard.  A poke-y.  Just a few times, too.  Not everything has...  Give him like a dunk, dunk, dunk.  Not everything has to be impressive.  There it is.  Not everything has to be impressive, Master Paul.  We're going for silly, too, here, you know.  So I got to stab it three times?  All right.  So who do you want to poke you in the gut with the sword? 
[02:26:00]  No, Sam.  Not you.  No.  No, Sam.  Sam doesn't get the privilege.  Sam, don't play.  Pick the most faggot person in here.  Yeah.  That would...  Because that kind of hurts.  So who's the biggest faggot in the whole place right now?  Yeah, because that one's silly.  Just the biggest fucking fag.  It's kind of faggoty.  What do you got?  Um, I guess, um, Twitchels. 
[02:26:30]  Twitchels.  All right.  All right.  No one's going to argue.  Come on in and grab your weapon.  All right, Twitchels.  There you go.  You're going to...  You're going to...  What, top of your person?  So you know what you're doing with that, right?  Poke him.  You're going to poke him with the silly sword.  My brother is going to take the bamboo thing and slam him across the chest.  I wanted the whip.  This is all going to happen at the same time, by the way.  So you guys all got to focus.  Yeah, it's going to be a gang beating.  All right, hand over the weapon.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right.  Now what?  Now what do we got next? 
[02:27:00]  All right.  Well, it's your choice.  I mean, I brought this in just in case.  That's kind of...  That...  Obviously, that's going to be in the lower back ass region.  The whip.  Yes.  That is like a little Caddo Ninetales thing you got there.  Yeah.  All right.  So what do you got?  We'll use this.  What is that?  This is a raton weapon.  Filipino martial art weapon.  It's raton.  It's a stick.  Why the fancy name?  It's a stick.  Okay.  And it has a grip from baseball. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  It has a baseball grip.  So where would you suggest he be hit there?  Some fatty region?  Forearm.  So that's head to toe.  Forearm.  Forearm.  Oh, no.  No.  I'm thinking more across his back, Kunta Kinte style.  Or is that...  Yeah, back like shoulder blades.  Shoulder blade area.  Look at poor Big A.  Right here.  Put your Big A on Ron and Fez.  Big A.  He's the cool guy on Ron and Fez's show.  All right.  Yep.  This is what we do to our trainers. 
[02:28:00]  Hey, this is what we fucking do.  Oh, you guys keep going on Ron and Fez.  That's it.  We'll show you what happens.  That's right.  Keep your head forward.  There we go.  Hey, here we go.  All right.  Now give him a little across the shoulder blades with that one.  The Ritton stick.  That's going to be a forward hand strike right here.  Oh.  There you go.  Okay.  That wasn't too bad.  That wasn't bad.  No?  What's the matter?  Did it hurt?  Was that right?  Oh, you didn't feel it.  Oh, I felt it.  I felt it.  Oh.  I felt it.  I felt it.  Who do you want to do that to you?  You. 
[02:28:30]  He's thinking, looking, trying to speak.  You.  Whip.  Anyone in the room.  He has a weapon.  We got E-Rock.  But E-Rock hits hard.  I'll tell you right now.  I'm trying to help you.  E-Rock is really.  He doesn't understand.  He's going to take out all the shit that is given to him on a daily basis.  We'll come out.  Oh.  Than?  Come on, Than.  All right.  Wow, Than.  All right.  Thanning can be nice.  All right.  What do we got?  All right.  We got another stick that looks like the stick you just explained.  Yeah.  What's the difference?  One has a grip. 
[02:29:00]  One doesn't have a grip.  You have a grip.  You have more traction.  So you'll be able to strike much faster.  This might be a little loose.  Loosey-goosey.  Got you.  A little loose.  Now, I would suggest that one probably across the lower thigh area, away from the groin,  but lower thigh area to complete the whole head-to-toe thing, really.  And I think we need somebody who's a little shorter in stature than, like, a Than who would  have trouble maybe hitting down there.  Than's good for the shoulder blades. 
[02:29:30]  So, in other words, pick a fucking midget.  Wait.  Do we have to hit him where Poe was suggesting, or can we just freestyle?  I would hit him where Poe suggested.  It covers the entire body without, you know, you don't want to bust up that face.  He's big A.  I run it fast, right?  Run it fast.  Hey, dude.  Give us a big A.  How long?  No time.  You're going to be big A.  Right now, you're the kid we throw our milk at.  That's right.  Give us a big A. 
[02:30:00]  Big A.  Big A.  There it is.  There it is.  Ready to be beaten senseless.  On Ron and Fez, you're cool.  You're cool on the Ron and Fez bus.  That Ron and Fez cafeteria, your table always full, because everyone just wants to sit by  you.  That's right.  All right.  So, who are you giving the other stick to?  Is that across the, what, upper thigh?  That's across the thigh.  Yeah.  The thigh area.  All right.  Yeah.  Oh, Keith. 
[02:30:30]  All right, Keith.  Keith wanted to smack you with the paddle, though.  He had the paddle in his hand.  You're kind of the wrong color for this, but okay.  All right.  Now, we got two more weapons left.  We got the paddle and the whip.  Well, we all know where the whip goes, so.  The whip's got to be the, yeah, lower back ass area.  Yeah.  The whip is for the back, and then you got the paddle for the fanny.  All right.  The only problem is that if you don't know how to use the whip, someone's going to get  hurt.  So, I mean, I can hit him up close to the back, and I'll go nice and light. 
[02:31:00]  Master Polo, you want me?  Why?  You want to get whipped?  Yeah?  All right.  Master Polo.  Master Polo used the whip.  That's easy.  Would you like that?  I would love it.  I know you would like that.  I would see you with oblivion.  Oh, that would be wonderful.  Sounds like fun.  Wait, what's going on over there?  I don't know.  There's a little confrontation going on between Danny and Polo.  Being an asshole.  Wow.  Nice.  Wow.  Whoever's going to whip him, whoever's going to whip him, stay away from me.  I'm going to have to contact HR.  I think you're going to whip him.  This is Master Polo.  Please do. 
[02:31:30]  And by the way, by HR, he means HR Puff and stuff.  The big stuffed character from the old Sid and Marty Croft show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you, Sam.  I'm a genius.  I would suggest you whip him.  Okay.  Where?  Anywhere in the back.  Yeah.  Again, Kunta Kinte style.  All right.  Give us a test whip.  He'll be like, and make sure we go, what's your name?  And he'll go, Big A.  And until he says, Big A, in the normal style, because this is the Toby Kunta Kinte thing. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, we whip him out.  Kunta Kinte, you're Toby.  Wham.  And then another fucking whip.  All right.  Two of them up.  Yeah.  Who are you?  Big A.  Who are you?  Big A.  What's your name?  Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  A little harder.  What's your name? 
[02:32:30]  What's your name?  Big A.  Oh.  You say it like that again, you're just going to keep getting beat.  What's your name?  Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  That's adorable.  Fuck, isn't he?  What's your name?  Big A.  God, look at the pride he's got.  The pride.  We're going to have to hobble him.  He's running out of steam.  We're going to have to fucking hobble him so we can't run off to other shows. 
[02:33:00]  Who are you on the Opie and Anthony show?  Big A.  Oh, God damn.  He won't give in.  Look, he's wincing.  He's wincing.  I'm Ron and Fez.  You're Big A.  But on the Opie and Anthony show, what's your name?  Big A.  Oh, God.  The pride.  I'm tearing up watching the pride of this man.  Once again.  He's not Toby.  Once again.  I'm Ron and Fez. 
[02:33:30]  You're Big A.  I don't beat Anthony.  You're.  Big A.  Oh, just hit him again.  Oh, boy.  This is uncomfortable for everybody.  I think he needs a beat down.  I think we got to give Poe permission to hit him harder.  I think he needs a beat down.  We ask you again.  On Indiana Jones, that motherfucker.  On Ron and Fez.  Big A.  With your leather jacket.  I don't beat Anthony.  You're.  Big A.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:34:00]  There you go.  He's been broken.  He's been broken.  Good boy.  But don't forget, Ron and Fez.  Hey.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  That's fine.  After 11 o'clock.  Yeah.  And finally, the paddle.  Who do you want to hit you on the fanny?  That's a bit of wood.  Big A.  Big A.  Chase me around the yard with a bit of wood.  All right.  Big A.  All right.  So everyone's got their weapons.  Yep.  Should we do it?  Yeah, everyone's got it.  Should we do it out there where there's more room?  I think we should probably do it out there where there's a little more room. 
[02:34:30]  Get a mic out there.  I'm sure this will only take about an hour, an hour and a half to get a wireless mic that  works out there.  All right.  The staff needs a good beat down.  Well, not you.  You supplied us with all the nude pictures we need.  All right, Big A.  Everyone's got their weapons.  They're stepping outside into an area.  A lot of spectators out there.  One, two, and three.  Wow.  Big A's sweating, too.  Yeah, he is.  It's going to be a lot of noise.  That's good.  I like breaking them.  But you've got to teach these people.  They'll run off. 
[02:35:00]  You know, that's what it was.  In the old slave days, if you didn't treat your slaves like this, they'd run off.  And the same thing's happening here.  We have them.  And then they run off to other shows.  I'm glad we're finally taking care of the problem.  Yeah.  I was noticing, like, you know, all of a sudden Stalker Patty just in the lobby waiting  to go on Ron and Fez.  I'm like, what are you doing?  I'm going on Ron and Fez.  What are you doing?  Got to make an example and beat these guys down.  And that way they don't take off.  I want to make it perfectly clear they're free to go on whatever show they want.  Of course.  But there will be consequences. 
[02:35:30]  All right.  Let's get out there.  I think they're ready.  All right.  Ready for the beatdown?  I think I can use this mic.  Oh.  Yeah.  Just look through the window.  Yeah?  Yeah.  We're ready to go.  I can see it.  All right.  Straight out.  There they go there.  Hey, are we doing two damage, two damage, two damage?  Yeah.  I think everybody should do LARPing rules.  All right.  You guys.  Where you announce the damage you're giving.  You guys.  We're doing LARPing rules. 
[02:36:00]  You got to announce the damage you're doing in Big A.  Just to geek it up even more.  I want to hear some poking.  I want to hear two damage very loud.  I want to hear Big A.  Will Mike him?  Now, just remember where you're supposed to be hitting.  Yep.  And Big A, I guess when you've had enough, you're fucked.  When you've had enough, just crumble to the floor.  Yeah.  That's what I was thinking.  Going to a fetal position.  Just going to the fetal position.  Well, no.  You've had enough.  Okay.  And then that will mean the beating will only continue for five more seconds. 
[02:36:30]  Mr. Poe's way too much into this.  Poe's way into this.  Yeah.  You just keep hitting.  I want to hear some poke the witch, too.  Poke the witch.  Poke the witch.  Oh, yeah.  It's a gang beat-in.  Here.  All right, Big A, you ready?  Yes, I am.  Poke.  All right.  They're all trying to figure out where to go.  Yeah.  Puchel's very excited, Anthony. 
[02:37:00]  All right.  Here we go.  Big A, you say go.  Go.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, wow.  Oh, and they're beating him.  Oh, he's down.  He's down on the floor.  Keep beating him.  Keep beating him.  Now we got where we want him.  Oh, my God.  Is he down?  Oh, God.  They're beating the crap out of him.  Holy shit.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  They're still hitting him.  He's on the ground.  He's in so much pain.  I'm Big A.  They're poking his belly. 
[02:37:30]  I'm Big A.  What's your name?  I'm Big A.  All right.  I think he's had enough.  I think he's had quite enough.  Oh, they won't stop.  Wow.  Oh, now they're throwing things at his face.  Big A.  Big A.  He got beat back into the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  Very good.  He knows.  Wow.  What a fucking thrashing they gave him.  That was great.  Holy Jesus.  The UPS came in with a package.  He was completely horrified. 
[02:38:00]  My shit hurt.  He dropped the package and ran.  He didn't even have anyone sign for it.  He didn't know what the hell he just walked into.  What happened, Big A?  Oh, my God, man.  That shit hurt.  They hit him a lot harder than I thought they were going to.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, did he get the shit beat out of him?  He went down within like three seconds, and they kept beating him when he was on the floor.  Oh, Big A.  Big A.  That's for the Ron and Fez show.  What's your name here?  He's Big A.  Big A.  There you go.  He might have gotten a straight genital poker, too. 
[02:38:30]  Fantastic.  People say he's not just like Full Metal Jack.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Oh, he should have had the bars of soap.  He beat the speech impediment out of him.  Yeah.  He speaks fine now.  Yeah.  Wow, there's like 30 people here.  I don't know where all these people came from.  They got to watch him get the shit beat out of him.  Who are half these people?  He's breathing heavy.  Yeah.  Wow, did he get beat good?  Big A.  You know, it is about time. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  That had to be dealt with.  Yeah.  You limping a little bit.  What happened to your leg?  What happened?  Where's all the damage?  Tell us what's going on.  Your back?  Back.  I heard some really loud, like, wax.  And I think it was Big Kev with the big, heavy bully cricket bat.  Yeah.  And he was hitting you where?  On my ass.  On your ass.  Really hard.  Real hard.  Really hard.  Wow.  Can we see your back? 
[02:39:30]  I think there's going to be problems on your back by now.  Yeah, let's see any marks on.  Oh, wow.  He has a little reddened.  Yeah, lift up that shirt a little bit.  Lift up a little.  Oh, my God.  Lift it up.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Look, look.  Right.  There's some great wet marks.  Right there.  You can't really tell under the hair.  Wow.  But when you move it away, wow.  You move the hair away.  He's got one really good mark that goes straight across his back.  Yeah.  So what hurt the most?  The spanking or what?  The poking?  What?  Yeah.  The poking was pretty good.  Walk us through what happened. 
[02:40:00]  The poking and the spanking really hurt.  The sense of the poking.  All right.  Hey, we got Fezzy from Ron and Fez on the line.  Fez.  Fez.  Big A.  I don't think he's answering to that anymore, sir.  Not on our show.  Well, what happened to Mr. Cool today?  Fezzy loves this.  Yeah, hold on.  Because Fezzy's kind of been replaced by Big A because Big A is so cool that Ronnie likes hanging. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  With Big A. He's like the cool guy at the lunch table.  And Fez has been cast aside.  And Fez knew Big A's true colors.  Yeah, exactly.  This guy's been making me look stupid for weeks now.  Yeah.  And now you see how fast he went back to just Big A?  Yeah, watch this, Fezzy.  So on the Opie and Anthony show, you are?  Big A.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah, see.  Beat into submission.  I'm sorry. 
[02:41:00]  I couldn't hear that.  Oh, Fez didn't hear it.  What are you called here on this program?  Big A.  Yeah.  Big A.  That's it.  No Big A.  No more Big A.  Personally, guys, I don't think you did enough.  I think those feet should be down around his ankles.  He should be bent over.  He should be rimmed or whatever you want to say.  Rimmed?  Well, what time are you getting in, Fez?  Dude.  I'll leave now if I have to.  Fez, we told Big A to get into the fetal position when he had enough. 
[02:41:30]  That could have been the funniest part.  He had a real problem falling to the floor.  He fell to the floor, got in the fetal position, and they continued to beat him.  And poke him.  They were sticking things up his butt crack.  And into his balls.  Who's carrying that fetus?  The mastodon?  The mastodon fetal position.  Holy shit.  And I got to tell you, maybe you can communicate this to Ronnie, but this is an example we're 
[02:42:00]  going to have to set.  Yes, we have to.  We have our people.  Now, we don't care if they go on the Ron and Fez show.  We love you guys.  But on this show, there's a place they have.  Like I said before, the guests, you treat your guests very well.  You treat your staff like shit.  We kind of do the opposite.  Don Brownie never let the freak sit at the dining room table.  Exactly.  This is like you guys kind of are feeding the dog at the table. 
[02:42:30]  You got to train him to go back to the bowl and eat out of the bowl.  You let Big A get a little too much respect on your show.  Well, you know, he's always walked in just thinking he's Fonzie, Vinnie Barbarino.  Yeah, the cool, the cool Big A.  Hey, no one said two damage, two damage.  I've got to turn it over again.  Oh, people are saying they didn't hear the two damage part.  Oh, we were saying that.  Oh, okay.  You couldn't hear it over his screams. 
[02:43:00]  Stop, stop.  I'm Big A.  I didn't hear that because they didn't have headphones on.  Was it good?  Oh, yeah.  He was yelling stop.  Ow.  You know, things that people yell when you beat them.  Oh, people were horrified.  The UPS guy was hilarious.  The UPS guy apparently came walking in.  He had a package.  He dropped it and quickly left.  There was a beat down going down right in front of him with primitive weaponry.  That was good.  Yeah.  Next time you need a little more armor when you're LARPing like that. 
[02:43:30]  Okay.  Who are you?  Big A.  Big A.  Let's see.  I like the sound of that.  All for you, Fezzy.  But after 12 o'clock today, he'll be back to, hey, Big A.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, tonight, tonight, Hard Rock.  He's going to be the coolest guy there.  That's right.  The Big Ass Bash tonight at the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square.  What time is that kicking off?  It all starts at 6 o'clock.  6 o'clock.  I am so there, you guys.  Beauty.  I can't make it, Fez.  I'm sorry. 
[02:44:00]  You can't.  I'm going to be in Atlantic City, but I would love to be there.  It sounds like it's going to be a great one tonight.  Is there going to be anyone working there?  I hear like 50 Mexicans got arrested at the Hard Rock today.  Yeah.  Apparently, everyone's going out the back door as we're coming in the front.  Yeah.  The staff just headed out.  What happened with that?  There's an illegal immigrant raid done by INS, and they busted the ESPN zone and the Hard Rock.  You know why, right?  And they got quite a few people.  They're trying to organize, so we go, all right, you want to organize? 
[02:44:30]  Look what we do now.  Now, look what we do now.  Look what we do now.  We all have this agreement, so let's keep with the agreement.  Hard Rock Johnny going to be running around working his ass off tonight.  Oh, yeah, he is.  You know, it turned out to be a big mistake at the Hard Rock.  The Mexican immigrants?  Yeah.  It was just Santana dropping off a guitar.  That's it.  The entire band.  It was like 80 people in that band.  Hey, Pocket Cowboys from Houston.  You could kind of hear the LARPing, but it was hard to hear over Opie yelling, hit him 
[02:45:00]  harder.  Hit him harder.  Yeah, Opie was really the cheerleader for the whole thing.  I got a little excited.  All right, Fezzy.  Have fun tonight, all right?  See you tonight, Fez.  Tonight at the Hard Rock, 6 o'clock.  Tell Stalker Patty we're coming for her next.  Yeah, we're thinking up something for her.  She's going to have to pay a little retribution.  All right.  And Jay Moore.  Jay Moore might have to also.  We got a special one for Jay Moore.  Big Gay.  Big Gay.  Take it easy, Fezzy.  All right, Fez.  Fez from Ron and Fez, everyone. 
[02:45:30]  Fez seemed to enjoy that beatdown.  Oh, he sure did.  He doesn't like being cast aside for a new kid.  New kid in town.  Big Gay.  We'll take a break.  Let's do that.  You all right?  Let me see the back again.  Yeah, it's got to be all red.  And before we go to break, I want to see that one more time.  The welts should be pretty good at this point.  What do you think, E-Rock?  Pull it up higher.  Pull up that sweaty shirt.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  It goes.  There's like three of them.  And then there's whip marks.  It's like the mark of Zorro.  Mark of Zorro.  It's almost a perfect Z. 
[02:46:00]  It kind of takes away.  Look how many whip marks are on his back.  You can see that one big stick mark that's pretty level.  But all over his back are angular whip marks.  Just look at it.  Big A, take the sweater off so we can really see the whip marks.  Oh, you're not wearing a sweater.  Oh, he's not wearing a sweater.  I see.  That's back hair.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Is that his butt crack?  There's like a tuft of...  Oh, jeez. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, Keith just nailed him with the paddle when his back was turned.  Oh, that's got to hurt.  Just in case you forgot.  Just in case.  Thanks a lot, Keith.  Yeah, lucky my hands hurt.  Yeah, his hands wrapped up.  He might have hurt himself.  Are you okay, Keith?  I'm okay.  All right, I'm concerned.  Too much jerking off, right?  Too much jerking off.  It's bling, of course.  Yeah.  That's what I think when I think jerk off. 
[02:47:00]  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  It's us, and we're doing something here today.  I don't know what it is.  This is Big A.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony, and fuck you, Rod and Fez.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Fuck everyone.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Hey, I just want to let you know that I hate my boss.  She's a complete douchebag, and I felt a need to call after I left work to tell you that 
[02:47:30]  I fucking hate her.  She's a fucking cunt, and I hope she fucking dies.  Hey, fuck you, you motherfucking cock-sucking piece of shit.  You dirty little cuntbag.  You guys are kind of cute.  I rub my cock every day thinking about you guys.  God.  I am rubbing my cock now.  Fuck whatever that was that just told me to press whatever when I stopped recording.  What the fuck was that?  And fuck this hole in front of me is going fucking 15 miles an hour on Route 1 in Boston 
[02:48:00]  because she doesn't know how to drive because there's a fucking inch of snow.  So, fuck her, and I hope her children are born with age.  Thank you, and God bless.  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, fuck you cunt.  Fuck all y'all.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line at 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, fuck him.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Some dude from Greensboro, North Carolina, thinks we're mailing it in today.  If you didn't enjoy that last night.  Mailing it in.  I don't know what to fucking tell you, dude. 
[02:49:00]  Seriously.  Chain mailing with the LARPing going on.  For the haters out there.  I may make an ancient.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  For the haters out there.  All right, I'll give myself.  That was a renaissance joke.  Must be nice to take Friday off, boys.  You guys are really mailing it in today.  Your show sucks.  Enjoy your forced retirement.  You assholes.  Warmest regards, Phil from North Carolina.  Phil?  All right, Phil, listen to me.  Phil's douchebag.  Here it is, Phil.  His hero's off today. 
[02:49:30]  He's feeling lonely, Opie.  If you didn't like the first hour over here at XM, I don't know what to tell you.  Seriously.  I really don't.  Yeah.  Okay?  And here's a little tip for all the haters out there.  Wait for a day when we truly suck.  Yeah, we know when that is.  And then you write one of these, it really will get to us.  It'll bother us.  We'll sit there and go, fuck.  It'll bother us all weekend.  We're like, fuck.  Fuck, man.  I thought we were tricking him pretty good today.  It was a Friday show and we dropped the ball.  Fuck.  But these type of instant feedbacks on a day like today, I'm sorry, dude.  And like the guy doesn't have an agenda. 
[02:50:00]  When he says, enjoy your forced retirement, does that mean that he thinks we're going to  get fired from something?  We ain't getting fired.  Dude, let me tell you something.  We're in renegotiations as we speak.  I will tell you something.  Number one.  That's right.  And I'll be completely honest.  Because of the situation with the way things are all set up with the companies, if something  did happen where they were allowed to merge, it's all federal regulations.  Who knows?  Howard Stern, definitely staying. 
[02:50:30]  Definitely.  Right?  Guy's there.  They're paying him all kinds of money.  He's like a marquee name is what they call it.  Definitely there.  You know who is second on the list?  I'll even give us second.  I'll even be honest and say we're second on the list of the marquee names that are  staying.  Oprah.  Oprah Winfrey is second.  Oprah and Anthony.  We are staying.  I like the sound of that because then I could retire, Phil, because I don't need to do this  shit anymore.  Phil.  So go ram it, Phil. 
[02:51:00]  All right.  Phil's a hater.  I want to get everybody.  Phil was here.  I want to get everybody in the studio.  I need, uh...  Phil, you can stay there.  Is this big, uh...  What is this?  Does this have something to do with what you wrote down on a post-it note during break?  Yes.  Steve, I got to communique.  Opie got a phone call during break.  Uh-huh.  He didn't say much, but he listened.  And then he said, just got some information.  He rocked.  That's right.  You better get in here.  And he wrote down the information on the yellow post-it pad and then turned it upside down. 
[02:51:30]  And now he is inviting people in for what I believe will be the big reveal of this.  It's like a fucking reality show.  Everyone, please meet at the end of the very luxurious staircase in this fake mansion.  We're going to play Who is Gay?  No.  Wow.  Well, do you...  Who has the big stack of cock pictures in their hands?  All right.  All right. 
[02:52:00]  All right.  Very good.  All right.  He just walked in.  Everyone's here, right?  We don't need Bill.  We got E-Rock.  Why don't we need Bill?  Poor Bill.  Bill is feeling really left out.  Bill, it's just that we don't want to, like, rile you to the point where you're going to go postal and everything.  Sorry, Tom.  You're out.  You're nice.  You got the sound effects like the...  We need some dramatic music.  All right.  Let me get a little suspense.  It must be bank number...  Than, get over here.  I wouldn't be helping him out if I was you, Than. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, no.  You got him.  You got him.  Ah, here it is.  All right.  This is...  Now you got me all suspense-filled.  Anthony, I got a phone call during break.  Yes, I noticed.  And we have another traitor among us.  Are you shitting me?  It's been confirmed on Instant Feedback.  I believe it was confirmed on Pal Talk.  And then to put it over the top, I got a phone call. 
[02:53:00]  Look around the room, boys.  One of you is a traitor.  One of our own?  One of our own.  Big A is not the only traitor in studio.  No.  Well, I would have to guess...  Is the name written on that paper? 
[02:53:30]  I'm going to read what this post-it says, and then we're going to look around the room  and see who gets a little nervous.  You ready?  Read away.  Just start staring at these guys.  Let's see who cracks.  It's not Bill.  It's not Bill, huh?  No, it's not Bill.  Good Bill. 
[02:54:00]  Loyal to the end.  Should be soon, I hope.  Scotty and Alex.  Scotty and Alex.  Uh-oh.  Scotty and Alex.  Oh, boy.  I've seen a face turn red.  Scotty and Alex.  What about them?  I've heard of them.  What can you tell us about Scotty and Alex?  Let's hear a little about Scotty and Alex. 
[02:54:30]  By the way, you have the worst poker face.  I know you've got Tourette's, but Jesus.  I actually play Hold'em.  I got Kings.  Scotty and Alex is a radio show on YSP for EFM.  A show that I was on a year before I ever came on the show.  I was a regular on the show before I ever came on this program.  And they're not nearly as good as you.  Okay?  All right?  There you go.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Sorry, dude.  I could have spit off you. 
[02:55:00]  I don't think Scotty and Alex were doing radio a year ago.  They were on 12.78 down in Atlantic City.  Right through up in the shore.  It was a small town thing.  I love the boys.  I love Scotty and Alex.  So you were doing their show when they were in some market,  and no one gave a shit about.  No, I was on...  And now they're in the big town that is known as Philly.  Wait a second.  And you continued to do their show and never brought it to our attention.  I did bring it to your attention.  You also knew I was on the Cousin Ed show at YSP.  Because I had to talk to you about that.  And I had actually taught... 
[02:55:30]  We brought up Scotty and Alex one time on the show.  When you questioned about me being gay,  and you looked at my top eight,  and you said,  Who the hell is Scotty and Alex?  And I told you it's a radio show.  I'm on down the shore.  Yeah.  So I'm not a traitor.  Yeah.  Oh, you're getting real nervous, aren't you?  Yeah.  I'm not nervous.  You're getting really nervous.  You knew that.  You already...  Who called you?  He's this kid a little fucking man.  That's right.  I'm breaking your balls on you.  Right away, you're getting fucking fish.  What do you think?  Fucking fish.  What do you think?  Should we have a jury? 
[02:56:00]  Oh, sure.  Bring in the jury.  Yeah.  Just hearing that...  Can you name your sources?  Huh?  The Philly crew called.  Oh, they did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that's...  He's pretty much on the show every night.  No, I'm not.  That's what I'm hearing.  I'm on the show whenever they call me up and ask me to be on.  How many times have you been on this week?  Oh, we got someone raising their hand out there.  Come on in.  Mike from Friday Morning Quarterback, FMQB.com. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Mike.  Hey there, I'm Mike.  What can you tell us about Scotty and Alex and the participation of that, of Louis Twitchell  Santani?  They definitely talk about him quite a lot.  Talk about.  Yes.  And he has appeared on the show.  I'm in the studio.  You know, when they were down the shore in Atlantic City, I was on once a month.  It was the first Wednesday of every month.  This was like at least six months to a year before I ever came on this show.  Okay?  And what?  Am I supposed to quit everything else? 
[02:57:00]  No, no, no.  Now, we've never said...  No, we didn't say that.  ...that you can't do...  ...that anybody on this show is totally free to do whatever show they want.  But there might be consequences.  There might be consequences.  Now, you can do our show and their show, and whoever else shows you, it doesn't matter.  This is how we play now.  Is that all you know?  Sometimes there's consequences.  There's more.  Oh, there's more.  No, no, no.  What else do you want to confess?  There's other shows.  No, no.  Do you want to confess to the Stern Comedy Tour, or we'll say that for a later date?  All right, all right. 
[02:57:30]  Here we go.  All right, see.  We got problems.  Here we go.  Here's the deal.  Something called the Stern Comedy Tour.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Let me clear this up first and foremost.  It better be the lawyer, Howard K. Stern.  When I first started doing comedy in 04, the Reverend Bob Levy took me under his wing  and let me do a lot of shows with him and helped me out.  This was way before I was ever on this show.  I did shows with him and some of the other Stern people.  This was before I was ever on this program.  Uh-huh.  And I tried never to bring it up because I never thought it was an issue. 
[02:58:00]  Okay?  Last Saturday.  Oh, Jesus.  What about last Saturday?  What happened last Saturday?  Well, maybe we should ask somebody who was there.  Kev?  Did Kev have info?  What did you witness?  We're going through testimony now.  Now, you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth to so help you,  whatever entity you pray to.  I do.  Okay.  What happened last Saturday?  I saw Louis Twitchell Santani performing in the Stern Comedy Tour in South Jersey. 
[02:58:30]  Not the Stern Comedy Tour.  Who was involved in this tour?  Beetlejuice.  Uh-huh.  The Reverend Bob Levy.  All right.  And some guy who's wearing a Howard 100 jacket.  Okay.  And what is it billed as?  That I'm not sure.  What is it billed as, Louis?  It's the Killers of Comedy Tour.  The Killers of Comedy.  Yeah, I've been doing shows with them before.  And is this because they were told not to use Howard's name in the presentation of this? 
[02:59:00]  Oh, no.  I don't know why they called it the Killers of Comedy Tour.  It was a show I did on Saturday.  I believe the reason is the use of the name.  Right.  Which, you know, arose by any other name.  Semantics.  This is Howard's people, of which you are one of.  Oh, what?  Yeah.  What do we got?  Okay, all right.  We have something up?  Oh, God.  What do you got, Dan?  Dan, now I have some more testimony.  I'm just looking at the lineup.  Exhibit.  We got Exhibit B here now on the video screen. 
[02:59:30]  Yep.  What are you looking at?  Just the lineup is Reverend Bob Levy.  Yes.  Sal, the stockbroker.  No, no.  Not for our show.  Well, that's just what I'm looking at.  Our show is Jim Florentine.  It doesn't matter what your show is.  This is the show.  Is there a rotating cast?  I was a guest on the show.  I'm not part of the tour.  I've done shows with Bob before.  Since 2004, I've done shows with him.  But I've never been officially a part of the tour.  But you decided to leave this info out conveniently when you do the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:00:00]  Do you want to hear something that you guys don't know if you know or not?  All right.  I didn't know that.  Over the spring, when I first started filming with MTV, I got a call from Levy.  And he says there's a show on Sirius called Kill or Be Killed with Artie and Sal.  He asked me to be on it.  I said, I got to check with Ben.  I called Ben Sparks.  And he sent me, I talked to him, and he said, we've done a lot of good stuff with you Twitchels.  We feel it would be in the best interest that you didn't do it. 
[03:00:30]  I called Bob back.  And I said no.  Oh, he's getting nervous.  And I said no.  And you can confirm that with Bob.  You can confirm that with Ben.  I said no because I thought it was like...  So then, that's when you decided to stop asking.  Stop asking what?  And just do.  No, no, no, no.  See, that's different.  Someone needs to be back.  Josh from Jersey.  Traitor.  Bling.  Eww.  Oh.  Traitor.  Bling.  I don't think you guys got much of a case because I was doing stuff with them before I was on the show.  Much of a case. 
[03:01:00]  This is open and shut.  That's right.  The judge, it's already time.  The judge is crying.  Am I going to get beat?  Eww.  Let's go to the Scotty and Alex website.  Wait a minute.  Et tu?  Et tu?  Bling.  The Scotty and Alex website.  Yeah, what's going on there?  Is he featured in any way, shape, or form on their website?  Oh, God.  You know, website is a good barometer as to how involved somebody is in a program. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, no big deal.  Chairman, I have some testimony as well.  Yes.  Okay, Elma, if you would please.  In the fall, we had a big comedy event featuring fans and people on the show.  Called Last Pest Standing.  Yes.  Should I continue, or would you like to?  You asked me to be a part of the show.  Oh, okay.  You had a great set.  You did great.  I did not go. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, that's right.  I had tonsillitis, and I was sick.  Oh.  I was sick as a dog.  But you told me about two weeks before, so did you predict the tonsillitis?  No, I didn't tell you two weeks before.  Sick as a dog.  A little blue dog that might have the words serious written under it?  I think so.  I think so.  I'm not a straighter.  You're out of order.  Your whole nervous system is out of order.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  I'm trying to think of anything else I might as well just say now. 
[03:02:30]  All right.  Thumbs up or thumbs down?  Let's go around the room.  Give it up.  And.  Thumbs up?  Anything?  Wow.  Anything?  Wow.  Wait a minute.  I put a thumbs up as, why is Opie giving a thumbs up?  Just as a goof.  Because I knew everyone else would do it the other way.  Because everybody else.  You need a unanimous decision.  You're doing bizarro world thumbs up or down.  Right, right, right.  Which means thumbs down.  Just to be a little silly and outrageous.  You're wacky.  I want to be outrageous today. 
[03:03:00]  Okay.  Hold on.  Opie's thumb.  That was zany.  Ew.  Opie's thumb.  Do I get any props for turning down Kill or Be Killed?  The only prop I want you to have is a fucking airplane prop in your face.  All I told you, Matt, you wanted his ass propped up.  I want that, too.  But something tells me that's happened already.  Are we going to go for the bare bottom spanking?  I think the bare bottom. 
[03:03:30]  I think the only retribution here.  No, no, no, no, no.  Wait, Sam's giving a big thumbs up for the bare beat out.  He's smiling way too much for that.  The man that also enjoyed the Harry Potter nude shots is also giving the thumbs up for the bare bottom spanking.  I didn't enjoy it.  Wait a second.  Are they growing on you?  Give up.  You.  Oh, and more information coming in?  Oh, what are you, the stenographer?  You're fucking writing something.  We're just starting what we need to do to him.  Oh, God.  What do we do?  What do we do? 
[03:04:00]  What do we do?  Some type of...  People are suggesting poke the witch.  That's what we usually do with stalker padding.  I think he needs something a little more.  Like, Big A went on a show that we have no problem with, Ron and Fez.  He became a character on that show.  Big A.  And for that, we beat the crap out of him.  This is much worse.  But it's a show when you're seeing that work.  He's involved, even in the peripheral end of it, with a show that is despised by this 
[03:04:30]  program.  Wait, you despise Scotty and Alex?  I don't even know.  No.  The stern thing.  I wasn't on the stern.  I'm talking about the comedy tour.  Don't, don't.  Wow, is his head spinning.  I got to compromise.  I got to compromise.  Stan just helped me out big time.  Oh, shit.  And this makes sense.  And Danny brought in, Danny wanted Twitchels to play, what's this game again?  Jenga.  Jenga.  Jenga.  All right. 
[03:05:00]  We're going to play Jenga with you.  Okay.  Jenga.  Jesus Christ.  Jenga flailing Tourette's victim.  I want to get, everyone knows what Jenga is, right?  Yeah, those little wooden blocks and you got to stack them up.  All right.  Big Twitchels.  Yes, sir.  Hello.  This is a compromise.  If you can play Jenga successfully, we have to figure out how many he has to pull out.  One.  One.  You've got to set up one without it toppling over.  I've never really played this.  How's it work?  You've got to pull blocks out, right? 
[03:05:30]  But do I have to start at a certain spot?  Top, bottom?  Any spot?  How about you play, uh...  You have to take one from anywhere and put it on top.  Yeah, you have to take one out from anywhere and place it on top.  Does he play with Danny or somebody and whoever, if he loses?  Play with somebody with motor skills.  All right.  Danny, you want to play, uh...  Sure.  All right.  Danny's going to play Twitchels.  Danny, you've played Jenga?  This is a compromise.  I have.  This is a compromise.  You beat, uh, Danny and Jenga?  Right.  You, you're free to go.  Free to go. 
[03:06:00]  But if you don't, you get a bare-bottom spanking.  Bare-bottom spanking.  Wait a minute.  With a weapon of anyone's choice.  Bare-bottom.  Bare-bottom.  Bare-bottom.  Who says I'm going to do that?  Bare-bottom.  Well, you can keep your underpants on and just pull them aside so we can achieve your underpants.  Underpants?  That's not going to make a difference.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  So how does it work?  Deal?  Whoever knocks it over the place.  Deal or no deal?  Yeah.  By the way, if you say no deal, you're never on our show again.  Yeah.  So it's up to you.  I figured as much.  Yeah.  You don't have much of a choice.  Gee, thanks for the option, bro.  This is really a dictatorship. 
[03:06:30]  By the way, this Friday, we got, uh, on the way, girls masturbating.  What?  Like last Friday.  Yeah.  We're going to do it every Friday to make, clear the gay out of the show.  Oh, like Drill Doe and things like that?  Like we did last Friday.  Drill Doe was great.  Just to clear all the gayness out of the show for the weekend.  All right.  Tell me I'm a ho...  I want to know your source.  I want to know who called you.  Oh, I got sources everywhere.  Because how do you not know anyway?  Everyone knew.  Do you think we listen to other shows when we're not doing our show?  We don't have time.  All right.  Let's, uh...  All right.  Let's get the, uh, camera on that. 
[03:07:00]  You're not doing it.  O-Van 2.  Remember, you lose to Danny.  Bare bottom spanking.  O-Van 2's frozen on me.  I'll be right back.  No, bitch.  Looks like a lot of people want to check the show out today is what's going on.  See this?  Give her a ring.  Exactly.  Now, here, you can open that...  Big Kev, open the door.  Because a lot of these listeners really want to take a peek.  They can take a peek at the doorway there.  Why don't you, um...  We have a lot of people out.  Show him an example of a successful Jenga move, Danny.  Sure. 
[03:07:30]  Okay, Danny.  What you got to do is you take one of the blocks from the bottom.  Now, is this, uh, like, uh, uh, whatever block you touch is the block you have to move?  Because I know sometimes they jam up on you a little bit, and you would obviously not want  to go for the jammed up one, but since you touched it, you kind of fucked.  Yep.  You want to try to get a loose one, but you don't know.  So let's see.  Okay.  Oh, here's one.  There you go.  Danny's going for the middle of the pack.  Once he touches it, he has to keep going with that.  Now he takes it out and places it... 
[03:08:00]  On top.  On top.  Now, this is preliminary.  Can I try it as a test?  Yeah, try it.  Now, do you have to...  That's fair.  Try it with a test.  Do you have to place it on top exactly like it's placed with the rest of it?  I think you can follow the pattern.  It's got to follow the pattern.  Oh, it does?  All right.  There he goes.  He's pushing out one.  All right.  He's trying it out.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Well, this is just practice, right?  Steady as a rock.  It took Danny two seconds.  It's a rock.  Oh, my God.  He had to, like, stop pulling it out. 
[03:08:30]  All right.  Well, you got to put it on top.  Like this in the middle right here?  Yeah, boo.  Well, I think...  It's however you want it.  All right.  All right.  Debo.  Yeah, Debo.  Whatever.  That's what I was thinking.  Debo.  Jesus, Marion.  You also...  And by the way, we should add that we turned...  We turned Twitchels on to Red Bull.  How many have you had today?  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  I drink it every day.  Every day now.  I had three so far.  Three.  Three Red Bulls.  One before I got here and two when I got here. 
[03:09:00]  All right.  All right.  Good.  So, we're going to start over?  I guess we can keep going.  Yeah, keep going.  All right.  So, what's the rules?  If I lose...  You lose, you get a bare-bottom spanking for being a traitor.  Bare-bottom.  And who's going to do it?  But if Danny loses, you're free to go.  Free to go.  You have no other problems.  Yeah.  I'm off the hook.  You're off the hook for old times' sake.  We can never do anything with the info we got.  Okay.  Here I go.  All right.  Danny's taking one...  Oh, that's the easy one. 
[03:09:30]  Look at you.  The middle-bottom.  Really?  And places it on top with nary a problem.  All right.  Your turn, sir.  Danny's kind of a pro.  Here comes Louis Quichelson-Tanney.  Could someone move that mic so I get a better view?  Thank you, Danny.  Maybe someone should hold the mic for...  Danny's going up in the ratings of...  Of employees for me.  Absolutely.  I think he's number three at this point.  Danny coming in at number three.  Dropping five spots.  Stupid Sam.  I just went through that. 
[03:10:00]  For wearing that ridiculous hoodie.  It's the hottest hoodie in the streets.  He thinks it's the hottest hoodie in the streets.  Meanwhile, it's just gay.  All right.  Here we go.  Twitchels.  Twitchels is really focusing.  Wow.  That's a risky move because he's doing a middle one in the middle.  But above it and below it, the middle ones are missing.  So it's a lot less structural integrity.  He's poking the block halfway out.  And now he's going to the other side to kind of now pull. 
[03:10:30]  Now he's going to...  If you understand.  ...pull that out.  It's just jiggling and shaking.  That is amazing.  I hate to make an awful reference, but it's shaking like the Twin Towers.  I know.  It really is.  It just does remind me.  And I don't want to laugh at that, but...  No.  You just did.  I'm not going for a laugh, seriously.  But it's just shaking like a tower.  I picture this ending with that thing looking like one of those houses during the atomic  tests where they just kind of implode, fly all over the room. 
[03:11:00]  By the way, Twitchels successfully got his second block out in the Jenga game.  Danny and a pterodactyl has just flown in the room.  Thought they were extinct, but no.  Anything's possible with our show.  All right, Danny.  Oh, Danny's a little confused.  I think having to stay so still for Twitchels makes it worse when he's...  Oh, Danny going with an edge.  Very strategic now.  Oh, very nice, Danny.  That's good.  All right, Danny.  Kind of taking away a little of the structure on the side. 
[03:11:30]  Back to Twitchels.  He's getting a little nervous with the middle.  Remember, you lose, bare bottom spanker.  Bare bottom.  He's looking it over.  Twitchels are really concentrating now, trying to figure which one to take out.  It gets a little tricky after a while, because you really got to watch out.  Uh, wow, that is...  I thought he was going to...  I thought he was going to screw up right there.  He was grabbing for it.  He was going to leave it precariously perched.  Wow. 
[03:12:00]  I agree with Josh.  Oh!  All right.  He got done.  Josh says, too soon, oh, too soon.  I agree.  Yeah.  Another 30 years I can make that reference.  Oh!  Twitchels very good.  And he's twitching like a...  And he sounds like some kind of fucking pneumatic actuator when he goes up.  It's like...  All right.  Danny is studying the game.  Don't get too brave for the factory workers out there.  By the way, I think it's official.  We're going to add bare bottom to the words we enjoy saying. 
[03:12:30]  Bare bottom.  Add it to the list, boys.  And Danny going for another middle one, about a quarter, maybe a third of the way up.  This one's kind of tight, though.  That one's tight.  Oh, boy.  Nice.  Danny does...  Oh!  Shook a little, buddy.  He got past the tight spot.  He put it back, and he stacks it on top.  Not a problem.  The tower shook a little bit there.  He got the DTs.  Yeah, a little bit.  That's all you can hope for is Danny was all drunk last night.  Hope for...  You could know, actually. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, we picked the wrong guy.  Damn it.  He shakes almost as bad as Twitchels some morning.  Yes, Danny?  I had that bottle of wine that Voss gave you.  Oh, did you?  The Voss wine last night?  How awful was it, by the way?  It was a $7 one.  Yeah, I know.  A $7 bottle of wine.  All right.  Twitchels is poking, poking.  He went deep.  He's down at the bottom of the tower.  He's on the other side now trying to pull out the block.  He's pulling another one with that one.  Uh-oh.  Now, what's the rules if he pulls one out but two fall off?  Does he have to put two back on top? 
[03:13:30]  No, he has to fix it.  I think you've got to fix it.  One's got to come out at a time.  You can't take two?  Yeah, yeah.  Can't take two?  That's fucking communism.  Twitchels, you concentrating?  Yeah, what's going on?  This must be hard for you.  Twitchels, you concentrating?  This must be so hard.  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Oh, God.  That's right.  We got about the jump strategy.  When you yell jump, he has, he's compelled to jump because of his OCD.  Oh, did it fuck him up?  Oh, wow. 
[03:14:00]  All right.  All right, refocus.  Okay.  There you go.  Just ignore that I said jump.  Steady, steady.  The jump thing won't touch it.  It's better not to move on my knees in front of wood.  Wow.  Ew.  It's like, keep it to yourself.  Why should this be different than any other night?  All right, here comes Twitchels.  Oh, no.  Look at that one piece.  This is tough.  That one on top now, he's pulling out a middle one.  But a very structural one on top is coming along with it.  He's not thinking.  This is bad. 
[03:14:30]  Look, he's shaking.  Oh, go back.  Go back.  He can do that.  He can do anything he wants.  What's wrong, Twitchels?  He's Danny.  He's yelling.  In my ear.  Yelling, whispering, same thing.  I don't think he should be able to hold a table like that.  Well, he's.  All right.  Here he goes.  Oh, boy.  Pulling it out.  It's so precariously perched now.  Oh, he's pushing back in to try to get that one piece that's popping out with it.  But I don't know.  No, it's coming back out. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, boy.  This is tricky.  Wow.  There will be no.  Oh, it's shaking.  It's shaking.  Oh, it's.  It's.  What if his hand just.  Oh, my goodness.  He got it.  He got it.  Oh, wow.  I think he's excited.  I don't know.  Look at him go.  Who can tell, though?  Are you excited?  Oh, you think it's going to be good?  He finally got it out and he's shaking.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He's going to blow it by putting it on top. 
[03:15:30]  Start the Rocky music.  Game on.  You got to fix that.  You got to fix the one that's sticking out now.  Do you want to kick it back in?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Just when we thought game over, Twitchell surprised everybody.  Is it going in?  Oh, wow.  He slammed it in.  I twitched into that.  Yeah, he twitched it back home.  Do you pull out your neck a lot?  It hurts a lot.  I would imagine.  All right.  Twitchell. 
[03:16:00]  It's okay.  Danny.  Very good.  Now looking.  Can I get some water?  No.  No.  Water kills contestants.  You can't only take.  There's a danger in only taking middles.  You will run out of options.  Yes.  True.  Very quickly.  Danny.  Yeah, because then once you take a side out.  All right.  Danny's going for a side.  Don't be a hero, Danny.  Yeah.  He is shaking a little bit.  All right.  Danny took a side out.  Very successful.  As he goes now to place it right in the middle.  There it is.  Beautifully done. 
[03:16:30]  He's a lot quicker than Twitchells is during this Jenga game.  Twitchells now surveying the whole thing.  Looking around.  A lot of structural integrity taken from the bottom.  There's no side ones taken out here.  No side.  So go for it.  All right.  You're a fucking architect.  All right.  He's studying it.  Twitchells is studying the Jenga.  Then remove that bitch of a bearing wall.  Oh, boy.  I'm going to go for this one. 
[03:17:00]  I think.  All right.  You think.  Which one?  Which one?  The one that was kind of sliding down?  The one right here.  This means there's only one middle one holding on.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Game over.  Worst Jenga move ever.  Wouldn't that be more difficult for him if I actually...  If it didn't fucking topple over.  Right.  What do you think?  That thing is steady enough to stand on one Jenga block in the middle?  Warm up the paddle.  He's talking one, two, three, four.  Four rows up.  There's three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, 
[03:17:30]  fifteen.  There's about seventeen rows above that one.  And he wants it to all rest precariously on one middle Jenga block.  No, no, no.  That's on your hand.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  They're scaring him with the paddle.  No, no, no, no, no.  Big head.  Jesus.  All right.  There's a fight.  There's a fight.  Fight, fight.  Big A.  He's not going to do it.  He's not going to do it.  All right.  Calm down.  He's not going to do it.  Full contact Jenga.  Bugs.  Bugs.  You crawled out of my tank. 
[03:18:00]  Could you lay this in front of the Jenga as he's doing it?  Yeah.  We didn't...  Harry Potter's...  There's no rules in this game there, Twitchels.  There you go.  Just leave Harry Potter's dick right there.  Yes.  Just look at it.  Give it up.  Look at his luscious...  Come on.  No hitting.  Unclipped one.  Fuck.  Is that hanging up on your wall with your fucking Wizard of Oz posters?  Gonna be.  Yeah.  I gotta get a color picture.  Come on.  I know that horse.  Here he goes.  Studying. 
[03:18:30]  Studying.  All right.  Here we go.  I don't think he's opting for that risky move now.  Wait.  He can go all the way up there?  Is that part of the rule?  I think he can go anywhere you want.  He can go anywhere?  But it's very difficult.  The top is difficult because there's not as much weight on it.  Oh, I see.  When you pull a block, you're gonna be pulling a lot of blocks.  Okay.  Here we go.  A lot of...  You touched that one.  You touched it.  I'm gonna go with it.  I'm gonna go with it.  This one right here, right?  All right.  Which one?  Might as well jump!  Oh, he's got...  Oh, that one's tight now.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  You know what you're gonna have to pull, I think? 
[03:19:00]  You're gonna have to pull the old tablecloth underneath the plates act.  I checked the rules.  This one was again.  This one or this one?  You're allowed to check for looseness.  Oh, you're allowed to check for looseness, Danny.  Oh, fuck, kind of a fag game is Jenga.  Yes, well, you're gonna...  I'm not gonna take that one now.  But you can only use one hand.  That's the...  Me both.  What are you...  Well, what are you gonna do?  No, I've been using one at a time.  I haven't been using...  No, I'm sorry.  Like, when you push, you can only push.  You can't use two hands.  Oh, okay.  So he's not going for that one.  Shit.  I was hoping he'd have to flick it out. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, he's taking...  Pull it out?  Anyway, you can take it out?  Yeah.  You can take it out however you want, sure.  There goes another one.  This one...  It is leaning that way a bit.  Oh, man, is he jumping.  What happened?  Why are you jumping?  You're yelling...  Oh, shit.  What is going on over there?  Is he slapping himself?  What?  Fucking Tourette's Jenga.  He just slammed his elbow on my knee.  Hey, he got it out, though.  He got it out.  Now he's got to get it on top without fucking it up.  Yeah.  Look at Harry Potter's cock. 
[03:20:00]  Very good.  Go ahead.  You.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, there's only one place to put it.  What is he doing?  On top.  On top.  Yeah.  It's on top.  There you go.  All right.  Danny's turn.  Oh, Danny, man.  Come on, Danny, Danny.  Danny, Danny, Danny.  Time for the old Danny Baroo.  Hmm.  Interesting.  XM should sign this as a channel.  Oh.  The Jenga channel.  Sign everything else. 
[03:20:30]  Might as well.  Fuck it.  Oh.  Oh, that one's tight.  Oh, boy.  He felt the tightness.  Yeah.  He doesn't have to stick with that one now.  Yeah, we know.  Unfortunately, you'd have been out if you did.  Yeah, but.  Hmm.  That's, uh, I see one you should go for.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's that bottom one, look.  Yeah.  A little tight.  One of the bottom middles.  The pokey.  Pokey, pokey.  That one right there.  Oh, you're allowed to get help?  What about the other one above it?  That's not a good one.  What about the row above it in the middle?  Yeah, but that's hanging on by, by, if I take the middle one out, it's probably. 
[03:21:00]  No, not that.  Next, the, no.  Bottom, bottom, bottom down.  Now up, up.  One there.  Now around the side.  Uh-huh.  Now about that middle?  Oh, we can try it.  Oh, God.  Danny, why are you shaking?  Tight.  A little bit.  Danny's shaking.  I think I can get it, though.  Oh, no.  Yeah, I think I can.  All right.  I can get it.  Good deal.  All right.  Danny's got.  Yeah, we're helping Danny because he wasn't a traitor.  Danny is pulling one out from the bottom of the whole stack is moving.  The whole tower is moving.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  We got to do it in, yeah, do it in, like, increments. 
[03:21:30]  Kind of go, oh, a little bit.  Well, you got to overcome friction.  Oh, we got a major problem.  Oh, Danny, Jesus.  You had to drink Voss's wine last night.  Well, this was on Ann's suggestion.  I'll remind everyone.  Well, this is all about simple laws of physics.  Anthony, help him through it.  This one is based on the fact that mass will stay at rest unless an outside force moves it. 
[03:22:00]  And an object moving will keep moving unless an outside force stops it.  So if you move it fast enough, the mass of the whole thing will keep it in place.  Yeah.  So give it a good tug.  Give it, like, incremental tugs.  Oh, shit.  I just moved it back.  That's all.  Yeah.  Little incremental bim, bim, bim.  I love the Jenga coaching.  Why couldn't that area be as loose as Ann to call Smith's pussy?  That is a tight one, man. 
[03:22:30]  If you could keep that straight.  If you could pull that out straight, you could pull it out.  Danny, quickly.  I don't know.  I have it, like, half out, too.  Quickly.  No!  No, it's all right.  It's all right.  Danny's sweating.  Danny, you know what you have to overcome?  The lack of friction between the table and the Jenga.  So pull that fucker right out.  No, no, no.  Pull it right out.  No, no, Eric.  It'll work.  No, it's...  It'll work.  Just make sure it's straight.  No, no.  I say take your time. 
[03:23:00]  I'm going to do it.  Straight.  Straight out.  There it is.  There it is.  I thought the tower was going down.  Oh, no.  Take that, Trico.  Nice.  Wow.  All right, you twitching ass.  All right.  Your turn.  Huh?  Game over.  What's...  I got to change the tape in my camera.  Hold on.  Hold on.  My camera needs a new tape.  Hold on.  Sam's got to change it.  I got to change the tape.  I keep going through tape because I'm taping the entire Jenga match. 
[03:23:30]  It's going to be eight hours long on YouTube.  It's going to be a 30-minute video.  Great.  Thanks.  I got my heart going.  I'm waiting for Tiger to run in and knock it over.  Tiger?  I can check for looseness, right?  Watch out for your bracelet, Marshall.  Check for looseness.  All right.  Kaboom.  Yeah.  Yeah, Marsha, watch your hair.  Your bracelet.  Wait, if that knocks it over, they lose.  Yeah, what are they going to get, a boat or a sewing machine with their green stamps? 
[03:24:00]  He's studying the...  They got a TV, by the way.  I don't want to ruin the episode for everyone, so everyone could enjoy it.  Da-da-da-da-ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  All right.  What do you say?  Well, the side effects you're providing me.  All right.  Thank you, Danny.  It's stalling.  It's stalling.  Yeah, you're stalling.  You are stalling.  15 minutes.  It's about last one.  15 minutes.  It was 30 seconds.  Come on.  All right.  I think I got it.  Yeah.  I think you got it.  It's called Tourette's. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, my gosh.  All right.  Here we go.  He's poking at all the blocks.  I'm allowed to check, you said.  He can't find a loose one.  Oh, there's checking?  Got to check them, Danny.  Right into the boards.  All right.  Wait a second.  Oh, he's going high where there's a lot less rigidity.  No, he's going to.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  All right.  He's going for a side block.  Job!  Oh, wow. 
[03:25:00]  That almost cost them.  Come on.  Come on.  I can do this.  Just give me a little time.  Give him a little.  I can do this.  Where do you get that?  In the can.  Oh, shit.  Oh, he's twisting.  He's using the twisting technique.  He's like twisting out.  Yeah.  Oh, that thing just leaned a little.  That thing just leaned.  We just lost a lot on that one side.  Oh, Danny.  You're going to lose to a guy with Tourette's. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, if you lose to this fucking guy.  You are our golden boy over here, Danny.  If you fucking blow this to a Tourette's guy.  I appreciate it.  You shit.  You shit.  Oh, man.  I'm getting my ass.  Problem?  Well, this one's real loose, but if I take it out, it's only resting on the middle block.  That happens.  That's what he was trying to do.  It could work.  If it's loose, you might have some integrity there on that middle block.  That might be where it's all resting.  But it might give it the stability. 
[03:26:00]  Holy shit.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Very carefully placed it on top.  That's what I thought.  Danny was screwed.  He pulls one out.  There's only one block holding up the bottom of the tower.  About a quarter of the way up, one block in the middle, is now holding up the entire tower.  Game over, man.  Good luck, Twitchels.  Warm up that paddle, Big A.  Danny is putting it now on the side.  Oh, no.  He's opting for the side to make it even more unstable.  Wow.  This is going to be difficult. 
[03:26:30]  This is going to be tough.  Down goes Twitchels.  Down goes Twitchels.  Twitchels eyeing it from one side.  Not really.  Doesn't really take a look at.  Oh, wow.  He just went to reach for one and hit the entire top of the tower and it shook.  He pretty much punched the damn thing.  There he goes.  He's checking for looseness on some of these.  Oh, now he's just with reckless abandon pulling one out from right about at the top. 
[03:27:00]  These, he's starting to pull out ones that have been replaced already on top.  He's only about three or four rows down.  He's having a lot of trouble.  But he got it.  Oh, it's back to Danny.  But he's got to place it on top, which is difficult for him.  He keeps...  All right, there it is.  All right, Danny.  All right.  Danny's turn.  Thank you, bitch.  Danny made the entire thing unstable.  And now he's got to figure something out here. 
[03:27:30]  Is there really talking smack with Jenga?  Danny!  There it is.  A quick one for Danny.  With Jenga, you could just be less gay.  But now a lot of weight is going to be on that side that you just took off.  And I saw it teetering that way.  There it is.  All right.  It's back to Twitchels.  Now it's only resting on one block in two spots.  I got to acknowledge that I'm pretty amazed that Twitchels has made it this far.  So am I.  Got to give him a little credit today.  We don't have to, really.  He came to play.  We could if we were nice.  He came to play.  He did.  He's got his game face on. 
[03:28:00]  It looks like this.  Here we go.  Oh, that's too tight.  Well, you're pulling it like a fucking lawnmower starter.  The listeners are going nuts.  Oh, no.  Another one.  Here it is.  Another one.  Back to the day.  And, Bill and Philly, have I really spent the last 45 minutes listening to two people play  Jink on the radio?  I know.  How ridiculous.  This is why we're number six in the heavy 100.  Right.  Oh, where is it?  Oh, God. 
[03:28:30]  Does he put that down rough?  Danny, what are you going to do?  Danny, you know you got to win this.  This is not just for you.  This is a victory for all of us.  All of us people without afflictions.  Right about now, I wish that you would have taken just one night off from drinking.  Just one lousy night.  Why not just wish for the sun not to rise in the morning?  It's Danny we're talking about here.  Oh, Danny, what do you got?  What do you got, Danny?  I'm trying to find one that's not so bad.  Yeah. 
[03:29:00]  This one's not that bad.  All right.  Not bad at all.  Pulling that out.  What an interesting turn.  Yeah, it uses the hinge maneuver, which worked very well, Danny.  We go back to Twitchell's.  This thing, want to describe it, it's not, this tower is really, really.  Yeah, it's really chewed apart now.  A lot of things resting on just one single block.  It looks like an old dog at this point.  But with all, like, an old mangy mutt with hair patches missing.  Yeah, it's just a mess now.  Here comes Lewis Twitchell's Centennial, as I love to call him. 
[03:29:30]  Fucking using his fucking Pebbles Flintstone language.  All right.  All right.  And he's grabbing, he's going to try again to just have one block.  This will be three single blocks in a row.  This ain't going to work.  This thing is toppling.  This is toppling.  Come on, Twitchell, jump, jump.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, wow. 
[03:30:00]  He almost set it off.  He's got to put it back on still.  Now he's got to put it on top.  All right.  And we know how delicate his touch can be.  Concentrate.  Don't think about jumping or any of that crap.  Three rows in the middle of the whole Jenga thing is only being held up by one block right over the other.  So there's three blocks.  All he has to do is place it on top.  Where the fuck is he antagonizing when it's his turn?  Give over.  Okay, okay.  He wasn't the traitor.  Why would we antagonize him?  Oh, my traitor.  Dude, we made fun of his alcoholism.  Yeah, I guess that's the point.  Give over.  Give over. 
[03:30:30]  One hand.  One hand.  One hand.  One hand.  One hand.  Use the one that isn't shaking.  You know, a friend's.  He's got to place this.  Oh, wow.  That was so reckless.  God, every time I think Danny's got him, it goes back to Danny.  This is not.  Oh, God.  I think we lose Danny here.  Come on, Danny.  He's trying that hinge move again.  The hinge move working well for Danny.  Oh, no. 
[03:31:00]  The whole bottom now being held up by one block.  One block.  He went all the way to the bottom of the tower.  Danny actually using the top block that he just put on to stabilize, I think, a little bit,  which may give Twitchells a break.  Twitchells now may be removing one of those side ones from the top.  Yes.  That might have helped him out.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  How is he getting away with this?  That whole tower went from side to side.  He's bitch slapping the Jenga tower whenever he goes to grab a block. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, is he twitching?  There's no top row, right?  You can't take from the top row?  Nah.  Nah, I would think you can't take from the top.  Did you stop it, guys?  Oh, my God.  All right, concentrate.  It'd be very difficult also.  Give me some.  I want to try.  All right, yeah, give him some room.  Give him some room.  That's only fair.  Now he's starting to look around the back end of it.  Oh, God.  Sam, get a long shot because this tower is going. 
[03:32:00]  This is it right here.  You think?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some guy is.  All right.  Some guy wants to go to class.  Oh.  No?  No, because it's going to be good.  I would.  Oh, because we'd go flying.  Just see how it plays out.  I can do this.  Because I think this is it.  This could be it for him?  Yeah.  Oh, the whole thing is shaking. 
[03:32:30]  Wait a second.  Are you talking about Lewis Twitchell Santani or the tower?  I think the tower has Tourette's now.  Oh, wow.  Oh, boy.  Oh, the teeter-totter.  It is now working like a teeter-totter.  There is one single block about five rows up that the whole thing is now shaking.  He's hitting it.  He's hitting this thing.  It's a bold move.  That is.  All right.  What are you going to do?  You're trying for that one?  All right.  It's up near the top.  Oh, shit. 
[03:33:00]  Holy shit.  How did that fucking stay up?  You still got to put it on top, though.  It shook.  That thing went back and forth like it was in an earthquake.  Dan is holding a piece of paper that says jump on it.  Oh, crap.  Danny's got a tough one.  Are you fucking kidding me?  You're going to lose...  Danny's got a couple of more that have the option to do the hinge move on.  I say go high.  Danny, you're doing very well with the hinge move.  That one actually brought up from the Ukraine during the Olympics. 
[03:33:30]  He left the room.  Where did Lewis Twitchell Santani go?  That sucks.  Wow.  Did you just shake that thing?  Anything going on?  A lot of them are tight.  I'll let you know.  A lot of them are tight, and now the whole thing's a big teeter-totter because they're  resting on just one single block for so many rows.  Yeah.  One, two, three, four, five rows.  Six rows, Andy.  All right.  Danny is trying...  I have only one block. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, shit.  That's tough.  Wait a minute.  You got it?  That's tough.  What do you think?  Wait.  Is that one Mike?  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  You can do it, buddy.  Oh, look at him getting cocked.  He's cocking smack.  No, he can do it.  I believe in you.  Danny, please.  Please, Danny.  Please, please.  Here it is.  Come on, Danny.  Yeah!  Oh, wow.  We have our first complete single single crossing.  No, there's a double there.  Okay.  Okay, there's a double there.  All right.  He went pretty high up on the tower. 
[03:34:30]  Wow, this is unstable.  That's extreme.  Putting it down is going to be really rough.  Just barely place it there.  It's going to teeter-totter to the right.  Oh, my God.  And he's on.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  It's back to Twitchell.  This is so unstable right now.  I say here's where it collapses.  No way.  No way.  He's poking.  He's poking.  He's poking at one.  It is shaking like crazy. 
[03:35:00]  We now have the picture of young Harry Potter with his cock hanging out and the word jump  written on it as a double distraction.  Oh, you just tore it off.  Don't worry.  We have plenty.  Oh, don't worry.  We have plenty.  Travis printed out 10,000 copies.  Danny's sweating his ass off.  I have to get some deodorant before I hit the running fast party.  Wow.  All right.  All right.  He's sliding this out.  I think he might.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  It's tipping over to the right.  What the fuck? 
[03:35:30]  It's tipping.  It's tipping.  He's going to have a tough time with it.  Jump!  Oh, my God.  Oh, it is still shaking.  The whole tower's shaking.  He's got to place it now.  But Twitchell's got the block out.  He's placing it on top.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, boy.  This could be trouble.  Oh, man.  This could be trouble.  The pal talkers are watching this with equal enthusiasm, Opie.  I can't believe what they're seeing here.  Everyone's screaming, come on, Danny.  There are now how many people in the room? 
[03:36:00]  How many people do you want to see my episode?  Hundreds watching.  Hundreds in the room.  Oh, they're watching.  Hundreds watching abroad, international.  We have it on the Armed Services Network.  Almost 500 people in pal talk alone.  There's a lot of people watching.  All right.  As Danny, our own alcoholic Danny, with the shakes from last night's Voss wine, takes on.  No, you can't.  What are you writing?  Big Kevin held up a drink, drink sign in front of Danny, which may throw him. 
[03:36:30]  That's not fair.  Danny trying.  Oh, shit.  The whole thing's moving.  He's trying row number four.  He's now feeling around for a Lewis.  Maybe I should just go on the Lewis Twitchell Santani approach and just pick an easy one  from up top and move that one.  Yes, do whatever it takes.  Whatever it takes to win.  Do whatever you got to do.  Our hopes, our dreams are riding on you, Danny.  Shit.  Oh, wow.  Wow. 
[03:37:00]  Holy shit.  Is that moving?  Take your time.  Take your time.  Take your time.  Everything's going to be all right.  You lose.  Look at this guy talking fucking smack.  That area is as...  Yeah.  That area is very tight.  Tight as like...  Pretty much.  Pretty much, yeah.  Huh?  This is a tough one, Danny.  A lot of people are wondering what John Minnelli's opinion would be on this bit.  Oh, guys, you spent a little too much time on Jenga.  Satellite radio.  We could phone it in here.  We don't care. 
[03:37:30]  What does the merger go through or fire it anyway?  What's up, Danny?  That says I can't take one from like a certain amount down or just cannot be...  No, I don't think you can take the top row.  That's pretty much it.  I have a block above it.  Because you're going to have a hard time putting the block on is the problem, too.  You could take that one and hint it out.  That's not legal?  Because it's not...  What does it say?  What does it say?  It's not the top row.  What are the rules?  Yeah, what are the rules?  Come on, Than.  Consulting.  Consulting.  Consulting the rules. 
[03:38:00]  Because I'm thinking if you even take one...  I'm sorry, Ant.  Okay.  Anywhere below the highest completed story.  Completed.  Anywhere below.  So you can't take that one.  But you can take...  But you can take...  Oh, wow.  I think I'm going there.  Oh, you think you're going there?  All right.  He's going second.  There's a single block on top.  He's taking his watch off.  Then we have a completed block.  And now he is going for the one just under that.  Very close to the top.  Very unstable bottom on this thing. 
[03:38:30]  Very unstable.  He's trying now.  He's holding his wrist with one hand.  Using one hand to try to hinge it out.  It is shaking a lot.  Oh, shit.  But it is moving.  It is moving out.  Take your time, Danny.  Take your time.  Take your breath.  He's got it halfway out.  Very, very difficult.  Very difficult.  Like Ant said, he's going for a block way near the top.  Way near the top.  But the bottom is so unstable that any wrong move here...  Yeah, this could be a problem.  Oh, shit. 
[03:39:00]  He's got to make sure he secures it before he pulls it out.  There you go.  Oh, wow.  All right.  A little more hinge move I think you need.  I think that's all I can go with, Danny.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  Oh, the hinge move.  This reminds me of 1968, I believe it was.  A championship between someone with Down syndrome and a drug addict.  All right.  Danny's positioned the block for the big...  He's positioned the block.  He's hinged it out completely.  It now looks like a diving board sticking out. 
[03:39:30]  Could someone get Danny a beer?  Please.  It is now a wooden replica of Harry Potter.  He's got to pull the fucking wooden penis out.  There he goes.  Listeners are turning.  They're now screaming,  Lewis, Lewis, Lewis, fuck you, man.  As he turned around like Rocky did and...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Explain that.  Let me tell you what just happened.  I didn't like that one.  Holy shit.  Danny pulled the block out,  and as he did it,  it kind of tilted down, 
[03:40:00]  lifting up a portion of the upper blocks  and causing it to teeter to what I believe  was the exact point where it should have fallen over,  but it came back.  It came back.  The closest I've ever seen a Jenga tower come to falling,  and I've been covering this sport for 25 years.  People are screaming your name on Pal Talk right now.  Oh, my God, Danny.  They all saw the whole thing like, whoa.  That was unbelievable.  Now, again, he still has to place it on top. 
[03:40:30]  A strategy happening here, maybe?  Is he placing this,  thinking maybe he can undermine  Lewis Twitchell Santani's next move  by placing this on top?  We'll have to wait and see.  I know where I'd like to go.  Dude, count the blocks, though.  We'd all like to stick one up his ass.  See how many blocks are on each side,  because that could be...  Do you think that would help?  A little bit, I'm thinking.  Seeing which way this thing is kind of more stable.  I would go for the same.  He's only got two choices.  One side or the other. 
[03:41:00]  He's got port or starboard.  That's it.  All I'm thinking is,  if you go to the right side,  you see the way down there,  that might lose...  But let me tell you,  if he goes to the right side,  the whole thing could teeter.  He might have to stabilize it,  which would hurt him,  or make it very unstable,  which could knock it down right now  and lose it for him.  He's going for the right side,  which looks very unstable.  Very unstable.  A lot of blocks on the right side.  I don't like this.  I don't like this.  He's placed it.  It is on.  It's on.  It has it successful. 
[03:41:30]  We have such an unstable tower.  Lewis,  Twitchell's in town.  He's turned.  He's stepping up to the Jenga.  He's twitching, of course.  His neck is flipping back.  He's now going also  for the row  right below the completed one.  But man,  that is tight.  There is no way.  He's going for the third row down.  Than showing him again  the lovely picture  of Harry Potter's cock  as Twitchell's tries his best  to get this Jenga block out.  Someone from Vincent Feedback 
[03:42:00]  punching out, guys.  This is way too much excitement for me  heading over to the Golf Channel.  Yeah.  Well,  completely understandable.  The adrenaline rush  that you get  from watching people play Jenga.  One hand testing, too, my friend.  One hand testing.  All right.  Oh, he's getting angry  at the pictures and...  Jump, jump, jump, jump.  Might as well jump.  Might as well jump.  Might as well jump.  Jump, jump, jump.  Go and jump.  Oh, there we go. 
[03:42:30]  Jump.  Jump.  Jump, jump, jump, jump.  All right.  Here we go.  Twitchell's going in for his move.  All right.  Let's go.  He's surveyed the situation.  He's just saying,  all right,  he's being cocky about it.  There's going to be nothing here.  He goes, let's go, let's go.  Here he goes.  He looks like he wants  to take one from  right underneath  the first completed square.  I do that.  But that looks very tight.  He's going for a middle one.  Three completed ones down.  He's going for the middle, 
[03:43:00]  but that one is locked in.  He just touched it.  Well, I can go anywhere, right?  You can go anywhere.  He's going low now.  He's going low.  I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.  This tower is very unstable.  All the blocks now tight,  which means they are structure.  It is making up the structure.  Let me see what this is.  This is tough.  He has given hope  to Tourette's enthusiasts everywhere.  This is an inspiration  for people everywhere  to have abortions 
[03:43:30]  if they find out  their kid is going to have Tourette's.  Here he goes.  He's gone.  Oh, boy.  You've got to go  underneath the first completed one.  Oh, what's that mean?  That means not the top one.  That means...  I've got to go under this one?  The third one?  You've got to go that one  or lower.  That one or lower?  Yep.  Official rules.  Those are the rules  as per Fan P.J.A.  Who is with...  Oh, my God.  Is he getting a middle one out?  He's tapping.  But let me tell you something. 
[03:44:00]  As he tapped it first,  it was coming out,  but he started an oscillation  that was not working  with the Jenga Tower.  You think so?  I don't think this is going to work.  Look, see?  It starts going more,  more, shaking,  more, more, more,  more, more, jump, jump, jump,  more, more, more, more.  A very risky middle block move.  Barely three rows down from the top.  He is now pulling  like a reckless nut,  and he got it.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, he's got to put it down now. 
[03:44:30]  It's a heavy-handed put-down.  Put it down.  Put it down.  I know there's only one place  to put it.  All right, let's do it.  Where the hell  are you going to put that?  Fuck.  What's...  Hmm.  I'm putting it down  on the top.  There it is.  Wow, Danny,  you really have to do this.  We are so counting on you.  Jesus, man.  We are so counting on you.  And we're approaching bonus time.  Yeah, it's bonus time.  We're in bonus. 
[03:45:00]  And we're in bonus.  It's such a good show.  I just hope you were listening  from six till nine.  That show is great.  Next, we're playing  Chutes and Ladders.  Yes.  With Ron and Feds.  Chutes and Ladders  with a water head.  Here he goes  testing for tightness  on a lot of these.  Wow, this is tough.  All right,  he's trying a hinge move.  No.  Trying on the other side.  He's about  just above  the middle mark  of the tower. 
[03:45:30]  The headphones  are coming off now.  Complete concentration.  Oh, he's going  for a middle block.  It looks loose.  I don't want to say anything.  It looks loose.  He's pulling this out.  I didn't think  it was going to take this.  A middle block,  a little above  halfway through.  He's got it.  And now he's placing  on top.  I've got to give him  credit for that.  Wow.  Shit, that's good.  Wow, you're getting  a lot of nice  Now he's got to  place it on top.  All this shit  because of Scotty and Alex.  I can't believe it.  Will you stop  promoting them, 
[03:46:00]  you asshole?  And now Danny  just very carefully,  very carefully  place this on top.  Here he goes  building the Jenga tower  a little higher.  Here comes the next row  as Danny places it  right in the middle  for easy stability.  And now back  to Lewis Twitchell Santani.  I don't think  he's going to make it.  Yeah. 
[03:46:30]  Here we go.  Concent Jenna.  Here he goes.  He's really surveying  this thing.  Holy shit.  He's going.  What are you doing?  Pressing.  No.  No.  I can't do that.  Oh, he's going  in the middle.  Oh, wow.  Wow, that thing  is shaking now. 
[03:47:00]  All right.  He's going for  something.  He's going for a middle.  Close to the top.  A middle.  This could be rough.  What are you doing?  Why do you keep  looking around?  Will you relax?  Everyone's whispering.  We're watching.  It's like golf.  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  How the hell  is he doing this?  He pulled one out.  He pulled one out.  He still has to 
[03:47:30]  place it on top.  Yeah, that's the  tough part because  now it's so unbalanced.  Oh, my God.  He's shaking like crazy.  Holy shit.  Look at his handshake.  Why are you shaking?  Look at his handshake.  Shake, shake, shake, shake.  Look at that handshake.  Shake your body.  Jump.  Oh, wow.  Jump.  Should we place the block,  please?  Place the block.  Jump.  Oh, wow.  He did it.  Danny.  Danny.  You're my bad.  Yeah, I know.  It's all up to you, Danny.  This is very, very difficult. 
[03:48:00]  Push it nice and easy.  We have added another tier  onto this so Danny  can start taking off  from the other  row.  There's a brand new row  he can work from.  But that looks pretty tight.  You can do the one  under the first  completed row.  Do you want to look at that?  We're not yelling  when you're up.  Are any of those  loose, Danny? 
[03:48:30]  Prick.  No.  Oh, my God.  The whole thing spun.  It's not so much that  it's not loose.  It's torquing.  Yeah.  On that first  middle block.  Yeah, right when you try.  How the fuck did we get  to this point?  I thought this would have  been over in like  a minute.  One minute.  Oh, Danny's got  some action though.  Danny's got another  center one.  He's found a way.  I think this might work.  How's it feeling, Danny?  It's to the point  where just touching  a block,  like your heart  is actually moving  the whole thing.  It wobbles the whole thing.  Only he can twitch 
[03:49:00]  and...  Fuck this.  You're being beat  by the short bus, Prick.  Here he goes.  Here he goes.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, shit.  That thing is really shaking.  This could be it  right here, unfortunately.  I hope not.  All our hopes,  our dreams,  Team USA.  This reminds me of  the American hockey team,  the USA hockey team  against the Russians.  Down goes Frazier.  Down goes Frazier,  another one.  I mean,  this is just  a memorable moment.  Deep-leading miracles.  It's behind the bag.  Oh, my God. 
[03:49:30]  Danny's got it out.  He's got it out.  But are you all right, Danny?  Danny's okay.  All right.  Danny's got to get us.  He's got to place it now.  All right.  He's got to place it.  He's placing it.  He's placing it.  There we go.  Wow.  All right.  Another successful one  and another row on top,  which means that frees up  another row  to choose from.  All right.  On the top.  On the top.  It's to you, Twitchells.  If you want.  Twitchells.  Lewis Twitchells Santani,  as they call him.  Much to my disgust.  Ready to be  Masters champion. 
[03:50:00]  Here he goes.  Playing Jenga.  Playing Jenga.  About to become  the Masters Jenga champion.  That's the first row.  Oh, it's a no.  What?  You can do the second row down.  Second row down.  You can do the second row down now.  So I can do this row.  It's the first completed row.  You can do that one.  I can do that one?  Anything under the first completed row.  Oh, first completed row.  Right.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  He's poking at it.  He's poking at it  and it's just moving.  See, that might sound easy  underneath the first completed row, 
[03:50:30]  but it might not be.  All right.  He's poking around.  He's poking.  I think we got a jammed board now.  Yeah.  This could be every single block  is now being used  to hold up this tower.  Did he find one?  Did he find one?  He's poking.  Poking.  Poking.  Poking.  Here he goes. 
[03:51:00]  All right.  We got major problems here.  Oh, my God.  Major problems.  Oh, we got major problems.  It's teetering,  but it held up.  He got it out.  It held up.  How the fuck is this happening?  Woo!  Oh.  I can't believe this. 
[03:51:30]  Danny.  This could possibly be  the most awesome game  of Jenga ever played.  Thank God it's being captured  on radio.  Danny getting right there.  Is this in two countries?  Yeah, two countries.  Your headphones almost hit  the fucking Jenga thing.  You missed it, honestly,  by a quarter of an inch tops.  Of course it is.  Two countries also broadcast  in Canada where,  by the way,  a little trivia,  the game is called Jenga. 
[03:52:00]  To you, Danny.  All right.  I see they're warming up  the chessboard  for our next segment.  Oh, wow.  That is a shaker now,  isn't it?  He's trying.  He's going low.  He's going low.  He's trying that one  like it's loosened up.  Maybe.  You've felt that one  how many times?  Danny, what about that one  over there?  Is there another cross one?  Way down in the middle?  We took an intermission  by now.  Way down the right side.  50 blocks.  No, I know.  All the way at the bottom,  the right side.  This?  Over there.  That one?  No, the one with the two.  Oh. 
[03:52:30]  That one?  Has anything going on?  Yeah, that's not really.  Okay.  You guys can help him  as much as you like.  He's going to keep suggesting.  Look.  Give up.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  Just touching it  is really.  Oh.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh.  Okay, okay, let's, let's be.  Be quiet.  Sound something.  Danny is hinging.  He's hinging out, but it does look like  it's hinged way out.  But he knows a lot of weight. 
[03:53:00]  He's pulling it.  No, it.  Come on.  There it is.  There it is.  Danny got it out.  Holy shit.  It's just a matter of placing it on top.  I cannot believe it.  Razzle dazzle.  Holy shit.  The placement is really important right now.  I think I got to go right side.  You got to go right side.  There's a lot of blocks on that left side.  I think you got to protect your interest at this point.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can't set him up for the fall. 
[03:53:30]  That's right.  Danny was in placement.  All right.  Let's try and see.  Here he goes.  Place a little place.  A little place.  Very pretty.  Oh, the whole thing moves.  Nice.  The whole thing is moving.  But like ten moves ago, I've said the whole thing's moving.  And this motherfucker, Louis Twitchell Centani,  now taking a seat between rounds.  He is up.  All right.  He's back up.  And moving toward the Jenga stack for another move.  Here we go.  Good game so far.  Give it.  Give it to you. 
[03:54:00]  All right.  All right.  He's surveying it.  He does a lot of looking.  Pretty much all I can do.  He's looking at the bottom of the tower.  Here he goes.  He's going low.  Looking low.  He's poking.  He's trying to poke that one that Danny keeps trying to poke,  which is like cemented in.  Yeah.  That's not quite going to work.  The whole thing is just teetering and tottering.  If I was a better man, this is it right here.  Teetering. 
[03:54:30]  Here.  Oh, wow.  He's pulling on these things to see if they're, if they can move.  He's actually pulling on them.  That must have worked with.  And the whole, yeah, well, we know that.  He's pushing out a top one.  Wow.  The thing is just moving like crazy.  He's covering his mouth from the ticks.  I don't want to blow it over.  He might.  He might blow it over.  Is that unstable right now?  He's pulling out a middle one.  Oh, come on.  Here's Harry Potter's cock again. 
[03:55:00]  Another one with jump written on it being crumbled up.  All right, come on.  Now he's going for the move.  He's trying to take this middle one out.  A little bit big.  This is difficult.  Oh, dear.  How long do these Jenga games last?  It's only too long.  I thought this would be 10 goofy minutes.  10 goofy minutes and now we're in bonus show.  Oh, wow.  Come on.  No, no, no, no.  He just pulled one out.  That thing is a trick Jenga game that's held together with strings. 
[03:55:30]  And he's got it on top.  It's back to Danny.  He put it on top.  Danny's move.  I cannot believe this.  Every time I get one out.  Hell, this is not right.  I'm like, there's no way he's got it.  No way.  There's no way he has one and then he finds one.  Fucking asshole.  This is unbelievable.  I'm going to go out and take some pictures in the lobby while you're doing this.  Oh, what, celebrity Jenga guy?  You know something?  The excitement here has gotten me to the point where I can't think of anything else. 
[03:56:00]  I'm fixated on this game.  Poe, could you get my truck?  I'm going to leave.  He's using two hands.  You're using two hands.  Yeah, but I'm not testing you, fuck.  You're just sliding, you fuck.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  Shut up, Twitchels.  No one wants you to win.  Oh, yeah.  You're gunning for him?  Here we go.  Come on, Danny. 
[03:56:30]  Danny is again.  Oh, he just smacked his head on the microphone.  Hinge move.  Oh, you all right?  I'm just really nervous.  That's a tough one.  What do you think, Danny?  I think I can get it.  Danny, how about your finger?  See how you've made a space now on the other side?  If you look around this end, no, this end, you've hinged it out.  Can you maybe get a finger and push instead of trying to push, like, use the edge of it?  Did you make enough room where you can now push that over? 
[03:57:00]  The same block you were going for.  Oh, like from inside?  Yeah, from inside.  So it doesn't put any sideways pressure on it?  Yeah, I think I could do that.  I'm hearing the game's up to 50 minutes.  Danny, come on.  I'll tell you right now.  All right.  I said it last time.  Never mind.  I'm thinking you get this out.  There's no way he's going to find anything.  You're wrong.  Yeah.  All right.  Shh.  You're south.  Holy mackerel. 
[03:57:30]  Oh, my God.  Amazing.  Is that a legal move?  That is a legal move.  What is it?  He removed one piece, and the tower stands.  And it's legal, then.  That's the one I wanted.  Let me tell you what happened.  So now he's got to put it on the top.  What the fuck is it?  Yeah.  He pulled a piece out.  It fell from his hand.  Dude, this game is possessed.  Teter lifted up a block that was on top to the point where it almost fell off, and then  placed it back down.  It's going to be a whole show of Jenga.  Exactly where it was.  This is an amazingly magic Jenga game.  Falls to the floor.  Falls to the counter or whatever. 
[03:58:00]  Doesn't knock the tower over.  The thing that wobbled wobbled all the way to the point where it was going to go all the  way, and then went snap back.  Unbelievable.  Snap back.  It's over here.  It's over here.  It's over here.  Unbelievable.  This is like Mark Spitz winning the gold medals that he won.  Sure.  It's swimming.  Breaking the four-minute mile.  Sure.  Come on.  That's what I'm seeing here.  Twitchell said he's got it.  Which block are you going for, Twitchell?  It's to you.  No, he's going over.  Sammy's coming over whispering to me, you got it.  You got it.  You so got it. 
[03:58:30]  Let me make a prediction right here.  All right.  There is no way this tower's falling right now with Twitchell's doing this.  No chance in hell.  It's falling.  I appreciate this.  You have no idea what he just did to you.  You will absolutely remove a block.  And that's how it will still be standing.  That's the brilliance of Anthony.  I know how sportscasters work.  He's working on a no-hitter.  Is he?  Not anymore.  Is he taking bets on this?  Huh?  Is he taking bets on this?  Oh, your battery's running out?  No battery. 
[03:59:00]  Your battery on your camera?  We're going to miss the end of the Jenga game.  I'm going to have to pull out my little camera.  Get a plug really fast.  Hold on.  We've got to get a plug.  I'm going to pull.  A plug?  We waited 50 minutes.  Might as well get the money shot.  Don't do it.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Don't even get near it.  I'm just waiting for it.  I'm looking at it.  No.  I'm just waiting for it.  I'm just waiting for it.  Ah!  Check my book bag.  Check my book bag.  Check my book bag.  Where's your book bag?  Where's your book bag?  Do this just in case.  Hey, I'm going to wait for the camera.  Guys, there's a mic on out there.  That's okay.  I like hearing the mic.  It was pretty interesting. 
[03:59:30]  Then trying to figure out where the fucking plug was.  Dude, we're playing Jenga.  And you want a good radio show at this point?  Never mind.  Right.  This is truly amazing.  A small break as we, Sam, change up.  I'll change off the camera.  Sam's plugging in his camera.  But, Opie, I just want to comment during this break.  The athleticism that we're seeing here today, second to none.  These guys are, they remind me of the old school Olympic athletes that were nude wrestling. 
[04:00:00]  A couple of homos.  All right, are we ready?  Here we go.  Cameras rolling.  Oh, another package.  Jesus.  All right.  All right, Twitchels.  Here goes Lewis, Twitchels, and Tani.  Very difficult move.  We can recap a little bit.  Danny has removed a block.  It was very precarious.  Looked like he was going to lose the game.  Placed one on top.  And Lewis now in a very tricky situation.  But he's gotten out of these before.  He's pulled the miracle moves.  Wow, the tower really teetered that time. 
[04:00:30]  He just barely checked for a loose one.  The whole tower teetered.  This is amazing.  But as I said before, I've seen a lot of these games.  And I've been watching this one from the beginning.  I believe five, six hours ago when it started.  And he will absolutely...  Oh, no, motherfucker!  There it is!  Down goes Twitchels!  Down goes Twitchels!  Down goes Twitchels!  Oh, no!  Oh, my God!  Oh, boy! 
[04:01:00]  Absolutely.  Thank God the battery was changed on the camera.  Because now we will get to see a slow motion replay of the finish of this later on on Foundry Music.  If you can find it.  If anybody would like to buy me a drink for my victory, I'll be at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Yeah, I will be down there, Danny.  And I will be buying your drinks this evening, my friend.  That's right.  Oh, shit.  Wait a minute.  I better mortgage my house.  I'm going to sign that extension quick.  Yes, sir.  Yes, Toby.  Oh, as the music plays, Danny, just a victory march. 
[04:01:30]  Unbelievable.  There he is, raising his hands in victory.  Look at the crowd just going wild.  They're chanting, USA!  USA!  USA!  USA!  Amazing.  Normal person.  Normal person.  Not a freak.  Not a freak.  Amazing.  Retard suck.  Retard suck.  Uh, Twitchels, anything you have to say?  Twitchels, uh...  To the camera.  To the camera.  Oh, I almost forgot.  I almost forgot.  I'm sorry. 
[04:02:00]  I'm sorry, Twitchels.  I just want to thank Jesus.  Yes, thank Jesus.  All right, very good.  There it goes.  They're now putting the championship 2007 hat on Danny.  And I always wonder, what do they do with the Twitchels championship, uh, hats and shirts?  Because he didn't win.  Yeah.  The champagne now.  Oh, my God.  The champagne.  Oh, boy.  Blowing now.  As it's poured over Danny's head.  As he holds up a picture of Harry Potter's cock.  Wow.  What a day for sports.  Unbelievable.  Twitchels, in defeat, do you have anything to say?  Yes, I do. 
[04:02:30]  Uh, thank you very much for this opportunity to get my ass kicked.  I'll hand it to you, Danny.  Why would your mic be on in the most important part of, uh, the Jenga?  I'll hand it to you, brother.  You did a great, great job, and, uh...  I know.  I'm normal.  Yeah.  I know I'm normal, Opie.  Have you ever heard such sportsmanship?  Fuck you, dude.  God didn't fall asleep when he made you.  Fuck you, dude.  God didn't fall asleep when he made you.  I'm tearing up.  Hold on.  Hold on.  The professionalism.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah! 
[04:03:00]  All right, so who's going to whack me with this paddle?  Oh, you can't wait, can you?  No, I'll get it over with.  Kev.  Oh, yeah, Big Kev gets...  What?  I was going to say, Danny.  Danny, you want to whack him?  Does Danny want to ruin maybe his hand?  You know, that sometimes send a shockwave his next round of Jenga.  We're going to play this, like, every day, I believe.  This is a new bit.  Instead of...  We watch people tune out by the fucking droves.  Instead of doing Line of the Day, sponsored by BodogFight.com.  Yes.  E-O-D-O-G-Fight.com.  BodogFight.com. 
[04:03:30]  We end the show with Louis Twitchell Santani getting a bare-bottom spanking from Danny.  Danny?  Yeah, and spread those cheeks open.  Sick.  Can I take a shit first?  No, we got to go home.  Can I take a shit?  No, no, wait a second.  Boy.  Can we go over some rules as far as how hard?  No.  Rules?  There are no rules.  There are no rules.  Come on, guys.  Let's hear it.  Bare-bottom spanking. 
[04:04:00]  Bare-bottom spanking.  Bare-bottom spanking.  Bare-bottom spanking.  Bare-bottom spanking.  You know, while he's setting up for this, I just got to mention, I just got a text from my girlfriend.  And she wants me to bring home a picture of the cockpit of Harry Potter, which Stan is now giving me.  What if, God forbid, I get into an accident?  No, I will not be taking...  Don't keep handing them to me.  Oh, what the hell?  I'll take one home. 
[04:04:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Oh.  All right, listen.  Isn't it on the web somewhere?  Travis knows where it is.  What?  You want to see it in all its lovely color.  Is this on the web?  Is this working?  Can you email my girlfriend this picture of Harry Potter?  Thank you, because I don't want to take this home.  All right, Anthony, with your blessing.  Anthony, clear the field, so men are going to do some spanking.  Here we go.  All right, bare-bottom spanking.  Ten, the Opie and Anthony show. 
[04:05:00]  Wouldn't this be amazing, Opie, if this cured his Tourette's?  And all Tourette's victims needed was a paddle on their bare ass.  Bare-bottom.  Bare-bottom.  That's right.  Sorry.  Bare-bottom.  Here he goes.  Danny's lining up.  Danny.  I think Danny's a little disappointed with the room he has to work with.  He's going to have to choke up on the bat a bit.  Danny, move the chair back.  Make sure you use the flat end.  Yeah, he's using the flat end.  I've got to pull my pants down.  Now, the pants must be pulled down because it has to be a bare-bottom spanking. 
[04:05:30]  There's Louis Quichelston Tanny's bare ass.  Oh, boy.  All right.  It's all loose.  Here it goes.  Hands on the counter.  Okay.  Hands on the counter.  Oh, well, he was very fat at one point.  He lost a lot of weight, so he could have joyly ass.  What's the problem?  This is really going to hurt.  What's the problem besides the obvious?  This is going to hurt, dude.  No shit.  Yeah, this is going to hurt, but the pain is what you've got to pay.  Yeah, you're right. 
[04:06:00]  It's like an old balloon.  You've got to remember what this came from.  This contest was your chance to get out of trouble, the trouble you were in for going  on a certain comedy tour, the Stern comedy tour that we found out in other radio shows.  You had a chance to get out of it by playing Jenga.  You did a valiant job, but you lost.  And now, what has to happen?  You have to feel the pain.  You have to feel the burn.  All right, let's just get this over with, dude.  Come on.  Here goes Danny.  Danny.  Danny's lining up.  Wait, I asked Danny before.  What's the problem besides the obvious?  Well, his ass cheeks kind of look like two helium balloons that have started to die, but 
[04:06:30]  they're not quite dead yet.  Just barely.  Like, where they just kind of move up and down the room?  Complete neutral buoyancy.  It's like, how is it hanging in the middle of the room?  Exactly.  Oh, by the way, good news.  They found the Harry Potter cock shot at OAVirus.com.  Yeah, but it was from the first movie.  Oh, shit.  Poor old FedEx.  Don't have to explain all of them.  That's very funny though.  You can't fucking hurt me.  You could break bones here.  No.  Tom from FBA. 
[04:07:00]  Very good.  All right, let's go, Danny.  Are you ready?  Make sure your aim is on.  Your aim is on.  It's got to be buttock.  Here it comes.  Everyone quiet.  Let's get it.  Oh, God.  This is, oh, my God.  Everyone quiet.  Danny, get a feel for the paddle.  A couple, you know, just so you can line it up nice.  Like, Evel Knievel used to drive up the ramp and then back down.  Just, like, just slowly.  I'm not going off.  We say it's right.  Just do it.  We stop moving around.  We're moving your ass.  Just slowly.  Why is Steve on his knees in front of Louis?  He's micing in the sound. 
[04:07:30]  He's micing his ass?  Dude, dude, don't wind up like that.  Danny has the most frightening windup, man.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  That was his test shot.  It's really freaking him out.  That was his test shot.  I can't fucking do this.  Yeah, Danny does have a Gary Carter, like, swing.  That's more of a tuffle shuffle.  You think a tuffle shuffle?  Yeah.  Tuffle shuffle.  All right, start with a couple taps.  Let's go.  What happened?  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Jerry's just smashed his head on the TV. 
[04:08:00]  You fucking fag.  He smashed his head on the TV trying to get a good look.  Yeah, trying to get a good look.  Come on.  All right, let's go.  We got to go.  Here we go.  Here it comes.  Everyone quiet.  Not real hard, please.  Whose phone's ringing?  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  We need silence.  Communicate.  Is this...  XM calling and saying no?  No.  Like, that matters at this point?  Like, we would listen to any fucking rule that any company tells us right now?  No naked girls allowed to speak.  We have another...  No, I'm just kidding.  Jesus Christ.  We got to go home. 
[04:08:30]  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Quiet.  Everyone quiet.  Here it comes.  Ready?  One.  Face forward.  No.  I got to look.  Face the mic then.  We got a blindfold.  Put the mic on.  No, no, no.  Let's get it over with.  Face the mic forward.  All right.  Close your eyes.  Will you just take it?  He's going to flinch.  Take it like a twit.  One.  Okay.  Two.  Two.  He's down. 
[04:09:00]  He broke his what?  I think he broke his skin.  I don't know.  I don't know.  See, it wasn't that hard of a smash.  Did you just split his skin?  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  Oh, take a look.  Take a look.  Let's take a look.  It's blue. 
[04:09:30]  Let's take a look.  Oh, shit.  The problem...  Well, not the problem.  Here comes a lawsuit.  Thank you, David.  I perfectly disperse the energy.  Did you?  Lewis Twitchell, let's see.  Stand up and show the...  And show Pal Talk.  Show the Pal Talk, Kevin.  Holy Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Do you have shit in your ass crack?  Did he fucking bat the shit out of you?  Dude, he said he had to take a dump.  Wow.  That one flew.  You can actually see the points of impact on each app. 
[04:10:00]  Back goes Griffey looking up, and it's out of here!  Or is it?  No, it's all for all.  My mistake.  All right.  Wow.  Wow.  Did you hear me ice?  Ice?  Icy?  We're the only radio show where people request ice.  What the fuck is wrong with us?  Wow.  What a day for sport.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to wrap up.  I wish this was TV.  We could end with like a montage of the whole thing happening and the thing falling and still  pictures.  Just amazing.  Twitchels.  What can I say, man? 
[04:10:30]  Thanks for what you do.  Well, thank you guys, and I'll never do that again.  You got a plug.  You got some comedy thing you're doing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm actually producing comedy shows now.  I'm doing a show with...  Man Cow.  Otto and George and my buddy King Kong Bundy, the rest of us, get into the comedy.  Otto and George, King Kong Bundy at the Broadway Theater.  This is March 22nd in Pittman, New Jersey.  All right.  Go to PittmanBroadwayTheater.org.  It's going to be great.  King Kong Bundy's getting into the comedy.  We're going to try to get him in for you.  All right.  And Otto and George.  Oh, wow.  And Otto and George, you know?  He's out like six months. 
[04:11:00]  I thought King Kong Bundy was dead.  I swear to you.  I'm not even kidding.  He's one of my best friends.  His name's Chris.  He lives right in Glassboro, five minutes from me.  Yeah.  We've got to get people to the comedy show because you're losing money like crazy.  I appreciate it.  Because you can't get rid of it.  As a parting gift, Harry Potter's cock.  There you go.  There you go.  You know what?  Everyone gets Harry Potter's cock.  Everyone gets Harry Potter's cock.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Everyone goes Harry Potter's cock.

We made fun of Big Kev for having someone do a drawing on a show.  We just played Jenga.  That's true.  We just played fucking Jenga.  For how long was that?  Does anyone know?  That had to be an hour.  Over an hour.  Over an hour?  Oh, what a bunch of tools we are.  Jesus Christ.  Please don't write about that.  An hour and three minutes is what the official tells us.  An hour and three minutes we suck.  Mike from Friday Morning Quarterback.  A big, huge fan of the show, everybody. 
[04:12:30]  FMQB.com.  He helps us out a lot with the radio show.  Gets us a little press from time to time.  I like that.  We do like that.  All right, guys.  Ron and Fez doing a show tonight?  Yeah, they're playing Tiddlywinks, actually, for the first hour and a half of their show.  Hey, Big A, just want to make sure.  On the Ron and Fez show, you are?  Big A.  On the O.P. Anthony show?
