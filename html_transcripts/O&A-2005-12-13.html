<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts and crew engaging in chaotic banter, including offensive insults and a self-deprecating statement about the show's quality.  They then transitioned to a discussion about the high Christmas sales of XM Satellite Radio, advising listeners to activate their gifts beforehand to avoid post-holiday activation issues and complaining about terrestrial radio commercials.  Big Ray the Trucker called in, requesting more airtime for Patrice O'Neill, prompting a discussion about the show's large roster of contributors and scheduling challenges. A caller later described the segment as a long commercial.

The conversation shifted to the high number of missing persons from cruise ships, fueled by a news report.  The hosts speculated on possible causes, including foul play, suicide, and the difficulties of search and rescue at sea. Callers shared their experiences aboard ships where passengers went missing, disputing some of the hosts’ theories. The hosts graphically detailed various murder scenarios at sea, interspersed with audio clips of news reports about missing cruise passengers.

The discussion unexpectedly pivoted to Andy Serkis and his motion capture work in films like *Lord of the Rings* and *King Kong*, highlighting the technology and the actor's skill. A further caller shared their experience on a cruise ship with a missing passenger.  The hosts returned to the vastness of the ocean, discussing the Mariana Trench and the show *Survivorman*.  They teased a "secret" to be revealed later and introduced Lizardman, a heavily tattooed man with extensive body modifications resembling a lizard.

The Lizardman interview detailed his tattoos, implanted horns, split tongue, and various piercings, including a genital piercing. He described the process of his modifications (including eyebrow implants by a biomedical engineer), his sideshow career, and stunts he performs, such as inserting objects into his body orifices and performing a regurgitation act called "Lizard Juice."  He also mentioned touring with bands like Disturbed and Corrosion of Conformity.  A phone call with Scorch, a Syracuse radio host from "The Naked Militia," followed, contrasting commercial and satellite radio.  The conversation included discussions of radio stunts, a hypothetical question about Ron Jeremy and Thanksgiving, the "Money Snatch" game, and Lizardman demonstrated his strength by pulling Patrice across the room using only his ear piercings. Sam, a former Opie and Anthony intern working for Scorch, briefly joined the conversation.

A subsequent segment involved racially charged humor regarding the racial background of Sam, followed by a listener call about a Bon Jovi song playing during a commercial break. Scorch, a musical guest, accidentally played commercials while believing the show was live, leading to humorous reactions from the hosts.  Lizardman’s music and sponsors (Jägermeister and the Jägermeister Music Tour) were promoted.  The hosts then discussed a news story about the "Soup Nazi" from *Seinfeld* opening a soup restaurant.

The "secret" was revealed as a free lunch giveaway at the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square, courtesy of Howard Stern, with the hosts encouraging listeners ("pests") to attend, particularly targeting the homeless.  The show then focused on a story about a mall Santa refusing a mother's request to take her own photos with her daughter, prompting racially charged commentary from the hosts about the involved parties. Multiple audio clips of interviews and news reports related to this incident were played.  The segment continued with discussions of the mall Santa story, the "pests," Richard Pryor's recent death (concurrent with Senator McCarthy's), and Opie's disappointing birthday gift.

A later segment started with a discussion on the awkwardness of saying "I love you" to family, specifically one host's mother, who readily accepts money of questionable origin. The conversation moved to their dislike of Hallmark cards, including racially themed cards. This transitioned into a discussion of one host’s relationship, including his girlfriend's high sex drive, his use of sex toys, his description of his girlfriend as a "reformed hoe,"  and his desire for her to maintain a specific appearance.  Patrice O'Neill joined in studio, discussing his relationships and sex life, including his glass dildo collection.  The segment included graphic sexual descriptions.  The hosts also discussed a controversial "Bad Santa" display and played a soundbite of a violent-sounding groin kicking incident. They discussed their fanbase ("pests") and their online communities, drawing comparisons to Fight Club.  There was extended discussion about *Brokeback Mountain*, including jokes, alternative titles, and interview clips.  Plans for a listener event at a Hard Rock Cafe and interviewing *Brokeback Mountain* and *King Kong* viewers were also made.


The show continued with a discussion of the *Brokeback Mountain* Golden Globe nominations, including crude and homophobic commentary.  They then mocked a New York Post article featuring a bloody Santa Claus display.  One host’s difficulties in obtaining a pistol permit led to him soliciting help through MySpace and the show's website, Wackbag.  The "F.U. Line" featured profane calls directed at Howard Stern. Martini Steve, a staff member, described his experience with a workout supplement overdose.  Finally, the hosts discussed several online videos: a failed stage dive, a car-bashing revenge incident, catfights, slaps, and an argument between a tow truck driver and a chiropractic office employee.  The segment ended with a Gamefly promotion.

[00:04:30]  THE END  Snapple and mayo, your dumps must be lovely.  And featuring...  Hurricane Ben!  Tortini Steve!  I think there's a degree of mental illness with everybody on the show.  Ramone, Ramone, Ramone!  Eric's dress smells like the diaper of a cancer patient.  Can I say for the record that this program sucks on a fat dick?  I got a few ideas, I can get it fired.  Please use them. 
[00:05:00]  Please use them.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning and welcome. 
[00:05:30]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  This is the ONA virus and it's spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  When does it become the plague?  That's a good question.  Yeah.  Maybe after...  They just can't do anything about it.  Maybe after the Christmas season.  They are selling radios like crazy.  Like what, Opie? 
[00:06:00]  If you had to tie it to something, what would you say they're selling like?  They're flying off the tables like waffles.  Exactly.  That's what I was thinking.  Boss.  That's what boss would say.  They're flying off the tables.  A little known fact about this good old satellite radio business.  Yeah.  They do crazy business this time of year.  Unbelievable business.  It's one of the hot Christmas items.  Oh, yeah.  You know, if you're buying somebody an XM Satellite Radio, you should do them a favor and get 
[00:06:30]  it all turned on before you wrap it up and throw it under that damn Christmas tree.  Good idea.  I think there's going to be a lot of people trying to turn on radios between Christmas  and New Year's, you know?  Yeah, you get it for Christmas, and then instead of calling up during the time where everyone's  going to be calling, do it beforehand.  Why not?  Load it up so they can just pop it in the car right then and there. 
[00:07:00]  Done.  Or turn on the MiFi.  Done.  It's already signed up.  Well, I mean, you open up the gift, and you've got this very, very cool thing that you've  never checked out before, right?  There's a lot of people out there who are going to turn their friends and family onto this  satellite radio.  Yeah.  And then you're sitting there with the MiFi going, oh, wow!  And then you're like, ugh, but it's not doing anything yet.  I'm getting a Channel 1.  Is that the one?  Yeah.  There's a number on it, but I don't know what it is, and then I get a preview, but... 
[00:07:30]  It brings you back to being a kid where you've got that very cool toy, but you couldn't  play with it yet.  Daddy got drunk and forgot to get batteries.  Exactly.  One year I got a 10-speed bike.  I'm like, hey, this is really cool, but I'm not going to be able to ride it for three  months.  Why?  Maybe four.  Unassembled?  Because there was a time when we were growing up, you know, that it actually snowed during  like the Christmas season and winter and stuff.  Although this year we've started off on a bad foot. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  A couple storms are ready in the New York area.  Patrice O'Neill, how are you, sir?  Good morning, sir.  Would you have to drive it, like ride the bike in your driveway?  In the plowed driveway in these little tight circles?  Oh, yeah, yeah, exactly.  Where you've got to keep putting your foot down and turning yourself.  Look, I'm riding my new bike.  I was excited.  That stinks.  So you had to try it out.  So you get your gloves and your hat and your coat on, and then you try to figure out where  you could drive it.  Yeah.  Pedal it in your driveway.  And then it just kind of sat in the living room for a month, you know? 
[00:08:30]  Great.  Brand new bike.  Brand new bike, and you can't do anything about it.  But so, if you're getting a satellite radio, you might want to turn it on for the person  you're buying it for.  Yeah.  Just a little extra thing for them, you know?  They'll be very excited.  They open up the gift, and right away they're spinning around the channels and checking out  what this thing could do.  And blowing off regular radio, finally.  Oh, my God.  Regular radio.  Yeah.  I actually, because I have to hide my XM satellite radio now, because I lost one. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Even the homeless people like this satellite radio, because I got busted into, and they  took my Delphi, actually.  Yeah.  So now I've got to hide it.  And this weekend, I was in my car, and for a split second, I forgot and had the regular  radio on, and there was commercials.  I'm like, what is wrong with this scenario?  Yeah, you don't quite pick it up immediately.  You're like, eh.  Right.  Right.  I mean, I know our station has some commercials, but I'm talking about a music channel.  It was WBA Bay.  Uh-huh. 
[00:09:30]  I had it on, because I'm like, ah, I used to work there.  Let's see what they're all about.  I never found out what they were about, because for the, I don't know, the 10, 15-minute ride,  it was mostly commercials.  What happens?  And then at that point, I had my XM all hooked up and ready to go, went right to Ethel, and  never turned back.  Thank you.  That is what happens.  I would be driving in, listening to, like I said, the news station, just trying to see  what's happening locally and catch some traffic, and it's just those morbid hospital commercials  come on, and they just keep going and going. 
[00:10:00]  And I actually say, what the fuck?  Like, I verbally, I say something before I hit the button.  It annoys me that much.  Yeah.  That there's so many commercials.  And the news stations now, even.  It didn't used to be that bad, with the commercials on the news stations.  They'd pop them in every so often, but then right back to it.  And now it's the other way around.  Now it's just morbid commercial, commercial, commercial.  And then you hear like a quick story, traffic weather, boom, back to commercials. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  They really stink.  And you know they're just like whipping the sales staff at these places.  Just more commercials.  More commercials.  That's what they're getting.  Good luck to you.  Have fun.  Have fun with that.  Let's say hi to Big Ray the Trucker.  Big Ray.  How you doing, boy?  All right, Ray.  It's always Big Something.  Hey, guys.  Listen, I ain't trying to dog Jimmy out, but can't you make Patrice like the four of  Seatner?  He's fucking terrific.  We love Patrice.  I mean, can't you like, you know, make a little extra room in the XM studio and put Patrice 
[00:11:00]  in there?  We got to figure out something because, you know, Jimmy in Hollywood, they're doing the  HBO thing.  We've been able to work with these fine talents around us.  That's right.  And now we got like a whole stable of guys.  And on a daily basis, I'm like talking to Eric Logan going, man, we got to do something  with Patrice O'Neill now.  We got to do something with Bill Burr.  We have to do something with Rich.  Never mind.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, we got all these guys around us, and we're just trying to figure out now how to  work them all in. 
[00:11:30]  We're all confused.  Hey, Patrice, those truckers love you, buddy.  Thank you, Big.  Yeah.  Hey, man, you guys have to have a nice and catch up on sale.  All right.  Thanks, Big Ray.  That's funny.  Green Snacks from Whack Bag says, this is a long commercial.  What do you mean?  Because we're talking about XM.  Oh, that's right.  Well, the point I was just.  You got to give it to him.  That is funny.  You got you.  Don't ban him, motherfucker.  No, I won't ban him.  That is funny.  We were just trying to make a very quick point, though.  If you're getting the XM satellite radio, turn it on for the person, because I'm telling 
[00:12:00]  you, everyone's going to be trying to turn on their radios like Christmas morning,  and it's going to be a nightmare for you.  So do it ahead of time.  It's not a pitch.  But turn it on comes with responsibility.  I would rather have somebody let me turn it on myself than to turn it on and go, here's the  bill, cocksucker.  Nice talking to you, because that's what you're going to have to do.  You hit him up for that.  It's on, but you know it's a monthly or a yearly thing that you're going to have to keep up.  So I'm putting this responsibility on your back, as opposed to just giving them the. . .  I'm just trying to help some of our listeners out, because I know they're buying these things. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  And it's going to be a tough thing to turn them on right away, I think.  Activated.  Do they have a turn-on deal that you don't have to give your name?  You buy it from wherever you buy it.  I don't know who has stores that have deals, but you buy it, and then you get it turned  on.  And that's all your responsibility, is to get it turned on for like six months or something  if you want it.  And then you just let the people know it's going to. . .  You have to redo the. . .  Oh, yeah.  Like, you could probably get it turned on for, if you're, you know, cheapo. 
[00:13:00]  You know, you get it turned on for a limited time.  Well, without your name, you know.  Just like, you know, if you get something cut on Anthony Cumia's name, right?  Yeah.  It's just like, now it's under your name.  And then when I go to redo it, they go, well, you're not Anthony Cumia.  What the fuck?  You know, we need all your information.  Figure it out.  I ain't going to pay for it forever.  That's what I'm saying.  You figure out how to put your name on it.  It was just a quick thing because we're selling hundreds of thousands of radios this time of year. 
[00:13:30]  And they all got to be turned on.  So you do the math and figure it out.  How many people could they possibly have, you know, manning the phones Christmas Day and Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve?  So that's all I'm saying.  Might want to help the person you're buying it for.  All right.  Let's say hi to Big Ron in Wisconsin.  Big Ron.  Hey, Anthony, man, this is fine.  I just want to comment on your show yesterday.  I've been listening to you guys for about a, probably about a year and a half. 
[00:14:00]  And I got to say, yesterday's show with that Dice Clay and all that, I mean, you guys had me in tears, man.  I think that was one of your best programs you had, man.  Thank you, sir.  Andrew Dice Gay.  Andrew Dice Gay.  That was the hit of the show yesterday, man.  Finally found a way to bring the Dice Man back.  Yeah, that was just great, man.  That could become a semi-recurring character.  Yeah, we're hoping.  Well, especially with the gay cowboy movie, I think we got some.  Yeah, yeah.  We just need some clips from it.  Well, we got something about the gay cowboy movie we'll play for you in a second. 
[00:14:30]  Thanks, Big Ron.  Okay, appreciate it, bud.  But here's our dilemma again.  This is because we're teaching Patrice just a little bit about radio.  Yesterday doesn't count.  No.  It's a wrap.  Done.  Yesterday is done.  Yesterday was yesterday.  Might as well have been last year.  I listened to the replay.  It was one of the funniest shows we've done on XM.  It's online.  But it doesn't matter now.  There are people listening.  Stupid.  Do it again today.  Do it again, motherfucker.  Do it again.  Every day.  Do it again.  Do it again.  There are people listening today. 
[00:15:00]  They didn't hear yesterday.  So they want to be entertained today.  They want to laugh today.  And you can't go.  You can't just go listen to yesterday.  Remember what we said yesterday, everybody.  Hey, everybody.  I don't care.  Call in and discuss what the fuck we're.  The genius of Andrew Dice Gay.  Do it again.  There was a call here at XM.  Do it again.  We're not going to let you coast, motherfucker.  That's what it is.  There's no coasting.  And then today, we could get calls tomorrow.  Dude, yesterday's show sucked.  You've got to just step it up.  Yeah, but the day before yesterday.  What?  I wasn't listening.  I didn't hear.  I don't know. 
[00:15:30]  I just signed up.  It's our nightmare, man.  Yeah.  Yesterday's show was probably a 10, but it doesn't even matter anymore.  We need to program another channel for this reason.  Those mornings when we truly suck.  And you don't have to tell us.  We know when we suck.  I love these people.  You suck today.  No shit, dude.  We know.  We know way before you where we can tell people, we suck today.  Go to channel two, whatever it would be.  Yeah.  And just have like a highlight reel just spinning.  Just spinning.  Like yesterday's show will be on a loop.  Right, exactly.  Like, look, we know we suck today, so go to this other channel and you'll hear lots of 
[00:16:00]  laughs.  Yeah.  Lots of laughs.  ABC, I'm looking at a story without a trace.  I heard a teaser for it.  It's cruise passengers lost at sea.  Yeah.  Apparently, that guy that they found that blood streak and he was missing and they still  haven't solved it.  His wife.  For a while back, you'd think it was a wife and a couple of Russian guys.  They cleared her though, man.  Yeah, there was a couple of Russian guys involved and there was drinking and some gambling and  I don't know.  Things just happened and no one knows what it is. 
[00:16:30]  So now they're trying to figure out a way to keep people from missing.  But apparently, he's not the only guy.  Like, this now is now a news story where they're scaring people.  I want to know how many fucking people.  Have you ever been on a cruise ship?  Oh, I love it.  Dude, how can you not ever not be missing?  If you ever walked on the edge of that platform and just like said, you know what, let me just  let me just jump.  Like, it's just like you just feel that.  I think we're talking about this, just that you feel the mermaid or whatever. 
[00:17:00]  You know what that is.  It's the fucking siren.  It's the siren and I heard it.  I wanted to jump off because the sea is so dominant over your life at that moment.  You just want to go in there and do the Titanic sink just to see what the abyss is all  about and it's easy to be missing on these boats.  Yeah.  But you think it's suicide?  You think it's people jumping?  I think I'm a strong-minded person because I get a lot of thoughts in my head that I  control without medicine.  You know what I'm saying?  I can control violence. 
[00:17:30]  Thank God.  I can control, you know, suicide.  Those thoughts creep in when you're just sitting around like, you know, what the fuck is life  all about?  Let me just smash my face into a bus, right?  Just, you know, or kill a motherfucker just to see.  Right.  Just to see.  But I have a natural medicine, you know, that I can muster up in my home.  So, but when I was on the ship, I was standing on the edge.  I was doing something, I think for Comedy Central or something.  I was just standing on the end of that boat and the darkness and the water swishing and 
[00:18:00]  I know what those sailors back in, you know, 01, you know, the Columbus, the Christopher  Columbus motherfuckers killed themselves.  There's something calling you to jump in and kill yourself.  Especially back then when there was no, you know, tuxedo night at the dining room.  That's why they had that stuff to take your mind off of killing yourself.  Is that what, all the good stuff, the casino, the shows, the, the, the stop at the port so 
[00:18:30]  you could go to the beach and see some land.  It's, they know that.  Because if they just leave you out there long enough without any distractions, everyone's  jumping overboard.  Paranoia.  I noticed some maritime documents somewhere.  Yeah.  Some oldie time with a, written with a quill, like on brown curled up paper somewhere.  Like in the movie, the thing where they find the Russian ship that, all the Russians fought  the monster and there's the one last survivor who has a tape and he's like, listen, don't  run, run, run, run.  And, and they have things like that from, from when people used to do all those, that there's 
[00:19:00]  something calling me into the water.  Into the water.  And people, and it's true, man.  I wanted to, it's the weirdest thing.  And that's where these missing people on the cruise ships are.  And we got to get, we got to get the audio because I was just watching it.  They just showed a montage of guys that are missing.  A whole freaking montage.  One after another.  Yeah.  We got it.  I want to know how many.  Oh, I've shown some Kong footage.  That same guy that did Gollum in the Lord of the Rings.  They put all the sensors on his face and he's the guy again doing all the facial expressions. 
[00:19:30]  For Kong?  For Kong.  This is a new fucking industry in entertainment, in movies.  That is amazing.  Who saw this coming?  You're a fucking face actor for CGI.  It's, it's, it's genius.  And this is, now he's the motherfucker for this.  He's going to have to get an Oscar.  Now it's going to be, you know, best pretending to be a real motherfucker, fake motherfucker.  Goes to.  Why, is he just the best at making expressions? 
[00:20:00]  If you watch.  How do you get that role?  Dude, I sat there and watched.  Why can't we have that role?  I think it was 600, 650 hours of behind the scenes footage from Lord of the Rings.  I watched every second of it.  I love that shit.  All the behind the scenes from, they got that Weta Studios down there in New Zealand.  Yeah.  And, and I watched them making the costumes, like everything.  And this motherfucker found a niche.  He was just supposed to be a guy.  They put him in some kind of leotard, and he would just be there to interact with the other actors. 
[00:20:30]  So when, when Gollum's there, they would be able to look at somebody, and he would deliver Gollum's lines.  But he was Gollum, though.  And he was.  Every movement that you see Gollum make, this guy was making, though.  He kind of morphed into that, though, because he was just supposed to be some schlep that's just a placeholder.  But he was so good with his movements, and his facial expressions, and his speech, because they finally ended up using him.  They weren't even going to use his voice. 
[00:21:00]  But he was so good with it that they used every, every frame of him moving.  Wow.  They animated over.  Right.  And used his movements.  And his facial expressions are amazing.  When they do a split screen, and show Gollum's face from the movie, and then his face, the guy found a, built an industry.  He made a new fucking career for people in Hollywood.  It's genius.  I was thinking about that yesterday.  And now he's the Olivier of that.  He's the man. 
[00:21:30]  But that's the fear.  Remember when people said the CGI thing was like, it's going to put actors out of them.  It's going to feel active.  But that wasn't doing it.  No.  This could possibly.  Because the computer guy, the guy that knows how to program a computer to make Kong, isn't the guy that knows how to make emotions on his face.  He doesn't know how to put him in a situation where he can look sad and stuff.  You need an actual human person to do those actions.  Did you see that clip just now?  They just showed a clip just now. 
[00:22:00]  With the dots all over his face.  No, Kong the movie Kong.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he's on top of the Empire State Building doing his thing with her.  And then the planes are coming.  And he makes that look like cock blockers.  He wasn't mad yet.  It was a disparaged, they're coming to kill me, I want to chill with you for a little while longer, baby, kind of face that only a person can make.  Only a person can make that face.  You could not draw that face, man.  It's going to be just a monster.  Let's go to Jason in Maryland.  Jason, what's up? 
[00:22:30]  Not too much.  What's up with you guys this morning?  We're all over the place.  Hanging.  We've got lots to do.  Obviously.  The reason I was calling is you guys were talking about the missing guy on that cruise ship with the bloodstain and the Russian mafia and all that shit.  Uh-huh.  I was on that ship.  That guy didn't, he did not commit suicide.  That's for goddamn sure.  How do you know?  Were you hanging out with him at the buffet?  No, I wasn't hanging out with him at the buffet.  But I saw the blood, and I'm telling you, from the height where that guy's room was to that bloodstain, there's no way just falling could create that amount of blood. 
[00:23:00]  I was on the same ship before it went over to the Mediterranean, where this guy was.  Yeah, and they were talking about how the ship was going from the Caribbean, where I was, and that it was going to be dry docked, refitted with some shit, and then they were going to send it over to the Mediterranean, and that's the cruise that the guy died on.  So I know what it looks like off of those upper balconies, and yeah, there's no way to get, to jump to the water from up there.  You're hitting that overhang that hangs over the lifeboat. 
[00:23:30]  Exactly.  And that seems to be where that big blood smear came from.  Yeah.  He might have jumped, but I think there's too many things that are going on.  Those Russian guys.  And they were everywhere.  That seems to be a little sketchy there.  Two Russian guys, the woman, the casino, kind of an argument, yelling, yelling, and then the shit in the room was just yelling.  She goes to sleep.  He disappears.  I don't know.  You think he jumped, though, Patrice? 
[00:24:00]  Nah.  This is some foul play.  Definitely some foul play.  They ought to put something on those ships where you can detect when someone goes in the water.  What the fuck?  God.  Get some night vision in the water.  You're done if you fall in that ocean in the middle of that damn Atlantic or wherever you are.  It's just, once you're in there, it's been a pleasure.  There is such nothingness out there that I couldn't imagine, if you don't die the second you hit that water, 
[00:24:30]  could you imagine bobbing up and down and watching that huge ship just pull away from you?  And the darkness and the utter quiet, like you'd hear that ship go away.  And then, and then you just, and it is so completely dark.  And you don't hear, you don't even hear that, um, what's that buoy bell?  No.  Ding, ding.  Ding, ding, ding. 
[00:25:00]  No.  Take a couple of, eee, eee, seagull, nothing.  Because it is so, it is so, even with the motor going.  Do you cry?  Do you cry?  Like, do you, is your flow in there?  Do you just decide?  I think the fear just kills you.  Decide to take a deep breath.  I don't know.  The fear just kills you.  It depends on if you could try to commit suicide or if you fell off.  You fell off, you are so fucked now, you're like, oh no.  And there's no help.  And that horse shit you see on Love Boat where somebody falls off and there's a,  and there's a little, there's a lifesaver flying. 
[00:25:30]  Right, right.  Julie, the cruise director throws you a fucking life preserver.  Man overboard, there's no fucking man.  If I jumped over when I, when I, when the sirens were calling me on that ship,  I, it would have just been a, a, a klunk that nobody except for somebody that was thinking  about killing themselves too, saw me jump.  Well, look at that.  Oh shit, somebody, I ain't doing this shit.  It's like I jumped off the boat.  If you, if you meant to kill yourself, you still got your crazy head on, so you're probably 
[00:26:00]  gonna just try to drown, whatever.  If you fell overboard, I think the first thing that goes through your head is, what time  is it, who knows, like in a split second, what time is it, who knows I'm missing, how  long is it gonna take for people to think, as that thing is just, meh, going away, you're  probably thinking, how long is it gonna be before they realize I'm missing and turn this  thing around.  And they're not gonna turn that cruise ship around for you?  No.  That is collateral damage, Mitch. 
[00:26:30]  They'll just call the coast guard, well our fuel supply just lets us get into a, we got  a tight schedule, and you gotta find them in the ocean, and you gotta, and you gotta get  coordinates of where you might be, and then where you floated, because all the, they should  hand out little GPS badges to everybody in that camp.  Now that's an idea.  There's an idea.  A little GPS.  We got the audio of the story here.  You know, once you board a cruise ship, you really are in the hands of the cruise ship  company, whoops.  But if something goes wrong, what happens? 
[00:27:00]  Who's responsible?  Well, that is the subject of that special hearing on Capitol Hill this afternoon.  I can't talk.  And it comes just days after another cruise ship passenger has disappeared.  When Royal Caribbean's Jewel of the Seas returned to Florida on Sunday, they had one less  passenger than when it departed.  A Canadian, 59-year-old Jill Begora, was last seen by her husband on Saturday morning  as the ship approached the port of Nassau in the Bahamas.  A search by a U.S. Coast Guard ship and the Bahamian Navy found no trace of her. 
[00:27:30]  Bahamian Navy.  Her family just wants to know what happened.  It's just too much to comprehend, you know.  I hope everything's all right, but, you know, all those things are sometimes.  You hope everything's all right.  Are you insane?  You're hoping everything, like she's going to turn up.  Oh, I was just taking a swim.  Yeah.  I like swimming.  Then you just ask a question, Mike.  What's the percentage of when people are missing on these boats, what's the percentage that 
[00:28:00]  you find them alive?  That actually come back.  0.0001.  They might have found one.  Can you please find them?  The one guy who lives.  Lost in the place where they keep, like, the vegetables.  Way in the hold.  Somewhere in the bilge.  It's Tom Hanks.  Yeah.  I was looking for the pool deck.  No, so when I ended up down here, where the fucking...  Some ass that forgot to take his medicine.  Ends up in a meat locker somewhere. 
[00:28:30]  Somewhere locked in a meat locker.  They never find you.  That chick, man.  That was probably a bad marriage, and the guy figured out a way to get out of it.  Oh, you think?  Because that's probably it.  Either you're killing yourself, or someone is killing you.  There's got to be people that plan it out and go, look, we'll be on a cruise ship.  Yeah.  A little slight push, and I'm good.  A little drink.  Maybe slip her a little Mickey.  And then give her the heave-ho.  They'll never find her to do toxicology.  What goes through your mind to give your loved one, because there was a time you loved this person. 
[00:29:00]  What goes through your head as you're giving her the heave-ho?  Not even the heave-ho.  What goes through your mind when you're...  Because you're already committed at the heave-ho.  Right.  What goes through your mind when you're like, honey, we're going on a cruise.  Like, and you hold the tickets up knowing I'm going to kill this fucking bitch.  The ticket wave.  The ticket wave.  You got both of them in your hand, and you're waving them like a fan.  Baby, we're going on a cruise.  And you know it's going to end with a heave-ho.  The heave-ho is somewhere in that itinerary. 
[00:29:30]  Do you talk with him?  We got Nassau.  Right.  All right.  And then we're going to St. Martin.  Right.  And then heave-ho.  Right.  Between Miami and Nassau, I'm doing the heave-ho.  Heave-ho.  And do you make sure she wears a special outfit so you can hold on to the outfit better to  give yourself some leverage?  I think nude.  I think you got to plan where your room is.  You want your room at the back of the ship.  Right?  Buy the bitch a rock coat from Jamaica. 
[00:30:00]  This the new rock coat, man.  It's made of stone.  It's made of stone.  Zip the rock coat.  And throw her overboard.  He'll throw this rock coat on, man.  You want to buy a beautiful rock coat?  We'll braid her hair with some big stones.  This is a big stone, man, yo.  Get down.  Did you get her the stone flip-flops, too, man? 
[00:30:30]  Some fucking Jamaican knows the deal.  Oh, it's a rock coat.  Here's the song that's playing as you're heave-hoeing.  People dancing on the upper deck.  Can you pop the bitch on right in the conga line?  Come on, everybody.  Do, do, do, do, do.  Come on, one more time around the promenade.  Oh, God.  Sink like a rock, rock, rock. 
[00:31:00]  When you're rock, rock, coach.  Come on, everybody.  All right, I'm going to try this.  So this is what's going on on the deck.  Right.  You do the heave-ho.  Yeah.  Big, do you have a splash, Anthony?  Oh, God.  You're getting ready for the heave-ho,  and everyone's having a good time upstairs.  Hold on.  So then you do the heave-ho. 
[00:31:30]  First, you've got to get rid of her.  Knock her on the head.  All right, you knock her on the head.  But she's complaining.  Then the splash.  Oh, that was the splash?  Yeah, you got it.  All right, here we go.  That's what she hears.  Fucking both. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, I found a friend.  What goes through your mind?  Oh, no.  And then reality sinks in, and it's over.  That's the boat.  The boat's sailing away.  That's the last thing you hear from civilization is fucking feeling hot.  Feeling hot, hot, hot, hot.  Oh, that whole ocean would be green from my yellow piss in that full water.  Oh, done.  I just would die. 
[00:32:30]  All right, here we go.  Here's more audio of passengers disappearing.  It is estimated that about a dozen people have disappeared on cruises in the last two years.  A dozen?  Legally, it is a murky area because the ships fly foreign flags.  And so this afternoon, Congress will convene a special hearing into crimes and disappearances aboard cruise ships.  The bottom line is we are suspicious, candidly, that there's some huge problems in the cruise line industry.  And we think that people are not aware of some of the challenges and some of the potential problems they may encounter. 
[00:33:00]  It's not a huge problem for the cruise industry.  There are people out there that have figured out how to off their...  Off a loved one.  A loved one.  A problem person.  Yeah, like I said, you've got to be in the back of the boat, one of the lower balconies.  So that way, no one, you know, is going to see the body floating by once they're off the back of the boat.  Nobody's going to anywhere.  You said you've been on a cruise. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, yeah.  You've been on a cruise, Opie?  Oh, yeah.  There's no place anywhere in the boat that you can't die and somebody will see you.  You don't need a special plan for this.  You just toss them off anywhere by the boat, anywhere, falling.  There's nobody to hear you.  It's a giant mall.  That's what the fuck...  Yeah.  It's not even something you enjoy to see.  It's not even the ocean.  And you would do it late at night while everyone else is pretty much back in their rooms.  Yes.  Snoozing, three in the morning, whereas when this guy disappeared, by the way. 
[00:34:00]  Quick, easy murder of your wife on the boat.  Ready?  This is so romantic.  Look at the stars.  We don't get to see those kind of stars in New York, do we, sweetie?  Oh, my God.  All the building light.  Look at...  Wow, I think that one's Jupiter.  Come here, bitch.  Let's go to Peter.  Peter!  Yeah.  What's up, Peter?  So the real question I have is, if you're taking a cruise out to Nassau, do you throw her off the boat before or after you get there? 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, I got...  Well, if you want to enjoy the beach, I would say after, because it's hard to throw her off and look convincingly sad if you're then on the beach hanging with some chicks and an umbrella drink.  Right.  I just lost my wife.  I can't find her, but I paid for the fucking cruise.  Right.  I might as well have a dirty banana.  Might as well enjoy it.  You know, I'm going to have a few rum drinks and...  Some pina coladas for everybody.  Get my hair braided. 
[00:35:00]  I'm going to have a rum whistle right after throwing the bitch overboard.  All right, I'm buying.  The fucking rock coat is killing me, Patrice.  Get your rock coat.  Get your rock coat, man.  And these goofy motherfuckers are buying.  Oh, a rock coat.  Wow.  A rock coat is great.  You got a guy on the coast guard.  Made of rock, you know.  Bill, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  My last duty station was in Sandy Hook, New Jersey.  Their area of responsibility was Lower New York Harbor.  And we were out looking for a guy that fell off a Russian trader. 
[00:35:30]  Tell you, man, there's no fucking way you're going to find somebody out there if they don't  have a strobe light or anything with them.  Yeah.  Plus, we used to do live man overboard drills.  We used to actually jump off the boat at nighttime with our strobe blades.  Wow.  You want to talk about fucking scary?  And this is a training drill where they know you're jumping, they're looking for you,  you have a strobe.  And they still can't find you because the waves are bobbing up and down.  All of a sudden that strobe disappears and then comes back because he's bobbing in the 
[00:36:00]  waves.  What's the official can't find him time?  What's the official we did what we could time?  Yeah.  You just fucking look for him.  You just look for him until he tells you to stop.  Are you kidding me?  These Coast Guard guys, they just make one big circle and look at their watches.  Nah, we know this guy's gone.  And what's your call?  Like, yo!  Yo!  All right, wrap it up.  You there!  Hello!  I bet they're a little more tactful.  I bet it's like...  Bravo, we're running a little low on fuel. 
[00:36:30]  We're going to be bringing it back.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's burning like crazy, the fuel.  I think we got a problem because the gates are in the habitat, but I'm sure we have less.  We're going back.  This motherfucker is so drowned.  It's so drowned.  Oh, the mic is still keyed.  I'm sorry.  You can't.  It's just, you know, who are you fooling? 
[00:37:00]  It is what it is.  You can't be mad about it.  It's the ocean.  It's unbelievable, man.  It's just so dark.  And so, and how deep is the deepest part of the Atlantic?  What, a thousand feet or something?  A thousand?  A mile deep?  You're talking...  After, after ten feet, who cares?  A lot more than a thousand.  Yeah, after ten feet, you're not surviving.  It's more than a mile deep?  Oh my God.  Oh my God, it goes down miles, man.  It depends on, I don't know about the Atlantic, but the Pacific, you were talking, the Marianas 
[00:37:30]  Trench in the Pacific is deeper than Mount Everest is high.  Oh, you got to understand, the only thing I get that tight body feeling in anything is  when, in any of these movies, when I see the end of the world wave coming over the Statue  of Liberty.  Oh, right, right, right.  It just, it just, that one move, deep impact, when the city was filled and you see taxis  floating in the river and people, it just... 
[00:38:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, the day after tomorrow.  The day after tomorrow.  Yeah.  No, it was a deep impact when the media hit.  Did it also?  It's just, it's horrifying, man.  There is, there is, like, I guess we assume nature is just going to continue its happy little  course like that.  We'll have our hurricanes and whatnot, but for the most part, there's not going to be  any cataclysmic event like that, but we're just at the mercy of the earth and the sun  and all those things that just, we assume, is going to continue.  I got a little fact for you.  The Atlantic Ocean has an average depth of 12,881 feet. 
[00:38:30]  12,000 feet.  That's average.  That's two miles.  That's almost, that's more than two miles, right?  At its deepest point in the Puerto Rico Trench, the bottom is 28,681 feet below the surface.  That's creepy, man.  That's five miles.  That's fucking mountain high.  That's where those fish that have natural flashlights on top of their head.  That fucking little lit up thing.  Fish.  And the big eyes and teeth.  You can't even call them fish at that point. 
[00:39:00]  You bring them up.  They look like aliens.  Those monsters.  They're so used to the depth that if you bring them up, they fucking explode.  They blow up because they're so used to all that pressure on them.  I just like the land.  I don't need it going out of space.  And the land good.  I like the land.  No out of space.  I don't think you've got to worry about that.  I don't think anyone's ever gone, holy shit, I'm in outer space.  How the fuck did that happen?  That's right.  Just in case gravity stops.  No one's ever.  People lost in outer space.  We'll tell you about it.  Just in case God decides to end gravity and you just float us all off. 
[00:39:30]  You know what?  I'm tired of these motherfuckers.  How horrifying would that be?  All of a sudden you're nothing to grab onto and you're just like, fuck, now I'm above  everything I could have grabbed.  I'm fucked.  And then I think for the first mile, it's kind of fun.  Like, hey, look, still breathe.  Wow, look, I can see Manhattan still.  It's getting a little cold.  It's getting a little cold, but the view of here is kind of cool.  You would just be thinking, when's it going to stop?  Is it going to stop?  I'm going to end up in space.  Holy shit, this stinks.  Let's go to Big Al.  Big Al.  How did Anthony know about the Marianas Trench? 
[00:40:00]  Because Anthony knows a little bit about everything, sir.  I saw it on Discovery Channel.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Let's go to Harry in Chicago.  Harry.  Yeah, hey, guys.  What's up, man?  I was going to compliment Patrice, but forget about it.  He wasn't going to say, oh, yeah.  They keep saying on these clips you're playing, the ships are sailing under international flags. 
[00:40:30]  Well, just a cool thing I read about that is that, first of all, you sail under the laws of the country.  That's why you have those flags.  But if you have no flag or some kind of silly, like, pirate flag, then just be prepared to be attacked by the military of any country you sail by.  Because they assume you're a pirate.  I mean, they'll attempt to contact you with, like, the speakerphone or something.  There's been a couple of instances where pirates, like we were talking about, the one off of the coast of Africa, where, yeah, they're not pirates. 
[00:41:00]  I don't think they're, they're criminals.  Pirates are an R kind of guy, you know?  R.  All right.  Still that name.  Yeah.  Fucking pirates.  You're a criminal.  You're trying to rob a fucking boat.  Another fact for you guys.  We're African pirates.  R.  R.  The Atlantic Ocean, average depth, 12,881 feet.  Pacific Ocean, average depth, 15,215 feet.  And the Mariana Trench is 36,200 feet.  God bless white people for investigating all of that for us. 
[00:41:30]  They go down in those precious suits that look like a fucking robot.  Like, you're completely covered in this suit.  I don't think they do those anymore.  They do, not the old, like, Iron Sea Hunt suits.  These things are modern.  They look like, it looks like a modern robot with these big ball joints on all the, where  you got to bend.  And they send people down.  And they've sent people down to the floor of that motherfucker.  That far down.  Imagine being down there.  Who are these?  Who does that?  And it sounds like, again, stereotype, but these are just, these are adventurous white people, 
[00:42:00]  man.  It's just fan.  Thank you.  Whitey loves it.  There's the suit.  Thank you so much.  So, look at that.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Who invented that thing?  Who goes into that?  And who gets in it and goes down to the bottom and walks around down there?  And there's some fucking thing that lives down there that you've never seen.  Yeah.  You know there's monsters that we thought were extinct that doesn't come, they don't come  up.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  It's like, why do that?  Yeah, what is down there?  Let's say hi to Doug and Jersey.  Doug. 
[00:42:30]  Spirit of adventure people.  Oh, guys.  They just love seeing shit.  You see that movie, Open Water, about the scuba divers getting left by the boat?  I haven't seen that movie.  I've never seen that movie.  I don't want to see that.  I saw that.  That seems a little too disturbing.  I saw it.  It could have been a much better movie.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  I thought it was good, though.  It was all right.  What do you want to say about it there, Doug?  No, that was just creepy as I've ever been scuba diving, but shit, that scared the fuck  out of me.  All of a sudden, they pop up after doing their cute little dive, and the boat's just gone. 
[00:43:00]  I heard it was giggling at first, like, they'll be back.  Yeah, and they're a few miles away, and then slowly but surely, they just realize, holy  shit, we're fucked.  Just eating the candy they had left in their pockets.  Yeah.  And then the sharks just came a-cruisin' as the sun was going down.  It was...  I just thought it could have been filmed much better, that's all.  The concept was great, though.  Yeah, just the idea.  I think this is the idea.  Yeah.  The idea of just getting stuck with that.  It seemed like it was a very cheap film.  Like, when you go to Blockbuster and you see Open Water, it looks like it's a big-time 
[00:43:30]  Hollywood production, and it really isn't.  It was filmed very cheap, it looks like.  All right, Doug, thanks for the help.  All right, punch it out.  Jesus.  Here's a little trivia for you.  Yeah.  That I found interesting, because we're talking about how deep the ocean is.  Oh, God, don't freak me out.  And how...  Yeah, this will freak you out, how insignificant you are.  How deep the ocean is.  You've got a portion of the ocean 38,000 feet deep.  How high is Everest? 
[00:44:00]  I mean, ridiculous.  28,000-something.  Yeah.  29,000-something.  Yeah, it's up where airliners cruise, you know.  Yeah, I think it's a shy of 30.  Right?  If you took the Earth...  That's right.  If you took the Earth...  29,000 feet.  Eric is really fast on the computer today.  And shrunk the Earth down to the size of a cue ball, it would be smoother than the cue  ball.  Even though there's these heights and depths all over the Earth, these nooks and crannies,  if you shrunk it down, it would still be smoother than a cue ball. 
[00:44:30]  What would?  The Earth.  That's how fucking big the planet is, that it could have such differences in heights and  depths, yet shrunk down, those heights and depths amount to shit compared to the size  of the Earth as a whole.  So imagine what one little speck of humanity is on that.  Nothing.  You're nothing.  I'm trying to...  I don't understand that.  Oh, I guess.  You don't understand it?  No, I'm trying to...  I got it.  I'm trying to...  No, I get it.  I don't...  I don't...  I'm trying to...  You take the Earth. 
[00:45:00]  Okay.  Shrink it down to the size of a cue ball.  Right, right.  And hold it in your hand.  Mm-hmm.  It's smoother than a cue ball.  Oh, even with all the...  Oh, okay.  With everything, it's still...  You wouldn't feel one bump on it.  Oh, okay.  That's good.  Even with all the things, because it's so fucking...  It's so big.  All right.  Listen, we're going to take our first break.  Scary when you think about it.  I don't like thinking...  Imagine smoking pot and talking about this.  Yeah.  You'd freak out, man.  You'd have to leave the room.  You ever see Survivor Man?  You ever see Survivor Man on one of those channels? 
[00:45:30]  A&E?  The guy goes...  He takes his own camera.  Oh, that one.  Yeah.  And he just goes anywhere where you're supposed to die if you're stuck there.  He's alone.  And he's alone.  He brings his own camera.  There's no camera crew with him.  His producer, he says, come get me in eight days or something if I haven't met you here on  the highway or something.  And they leave him out in the middle of nowhere.  And he just survived.  And he's got to live.  Lighting fires, eating what he's supposed to eat, snails.  And he's really at that point of death.  And he's not even...  What a great concept for a show, man. 
[00:46:00]  He puts the camera on a stick so he can be away from him, so you can get kind of a further  view.  He sets up a tripod.  He's a director for the whole thing.  Pretty cool.  Good concept.  All right.  Listen, we've got to take a break.  When we get back, Steve is shivering.  We're going to get to the bottom of that.  He's wearing a robe.  He's wearing a robe and he's shivering.  Yeah.  Make your own joke, people.  But I don't know what the hell he's doing.  We might have to have an intervention or something.  I thought he was just nervous, but I told him the hunt in Jersey is off. 
[00:46:30]  It's done.  It's over.  They're not shooting at you anymore.  Go home.  So he's shivering.  We have a great story that's on the cover of the New York Post.  We'll get into next.  Bad Santa.  Hilarious.  Makes me laugh really hard this morning.  We'll get into that.  And some other things.  We've got news teases.  And oh, oh, oh, big news.  We have a secret.  What was that?  That was right on cue.  We have a secret.  Where did that come from? 
[00:47:00]  Some kind of electronic sound.  Is that your phone?  Is your phone ringing?  It was on cue.  We have a secret that we want to share with our listeners.  I was touched too, Opie.  Someone has a big surprise for their listeners, and we know about it.  Oh.  Yeah.  So we're going to pass it on to our listeners before he can break the news.  Yes.  So stay tuned for a secret.  Yeah, this big surprise. 
[00:47:30]  This big surprise.  That's going to drive some people nuts today.  All right, Patrice will answer his phone, and we'll continue in just a bit.  It's on.  Get me, get me, get me, get me, get me, get me, get an old Leroy, Leroy, Leroy.  Needed a head, needed a drawing.  Himmager, himmager, himmager, himmager, himmager, well done with that.  Yeah.  Which, what?  Why?  Where?  Sure.  What?  What?  Who?  Well, what?  We have problems.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Shake it up. 
[00:48:00]  I don't know.  Unbelievable.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, we have a secret.  Oh, we have a secret.  Call all your friends and tell them to listen to the Opie and Anthony program today, because  we have a secret.  A secret.  It's one of those secrets that people like keeping.  That's right.  And they get mad when other people blow it, because a lot of work and effort and time 
[00:48:30]  went into the secret.  Calling all pests.  We have a secret.  Alert the media after we tell you the secret.  Pests.  Pests.  Alert.  Alert.  They got to call each other now and tell them to listen to the radio.  So we'll give them a few minutes and then we'll tell you the secret, okay?  It's going to drive somebody nuts today.  We got a lizard guy outside the studio.  Lizard Man?  Yeah.  I've seen him on TV, man.  Yeah, the... 
[00:49:00]  What was that show about the tattooing?  He's been on a million different shows.  I saw him on the tattoo show where they alter their bodies.  I'm looking at his repertoire of stuff and wow.  Ripley's, believe it or not, with Dean Cain.  He was the original guys on Ripley's.  I saw him on another show.  Some A&E show.  He'll tell me.  What A&E show?  Should we get him in now or...  I'm telling you, I know my lizard people.  I've seen guys that do one or two of these things, you know, that he's listed as things he does. 
[00:49:30]  Right.  Not all of these.  My bitch does all of them.  This is insane.  Well, let's get Lizard Man right in.  Why make him wait?  Lizard Man, come on in, man.  My girl escapes from straight jackets.  Yeah.  Lays on a bed of nails.  She puts concrete on her groin.  That's why I love him.  Lizard Man he is.  What's up, man?  Yeah, that's right.  Ripley's, right?  Yes.  They have a Ripley.  But also another show.  What was the other show about what you were on with the lion guy and all that? 
[00:50:00]  Just recently, Discovery Health took a program I did in Europe and repackaged it at Humanimals.  Oh, sorry.  I'm not close.  People that change themselves to look like animals.  They got that chick that thinks she's a cat.  Oh, there's a thing going on like that?  The one in New York, Jocelyn Wildstein or Katzen.  Yeah, yeah, right?  Katzen's the tiger lady who's worked in sideshows and done a lot of things.  And there's a name for this now?  When you alter your body to look like an animal?  Well, I came up with a word when I was a concept artist in college.  I called it single-themed full-body transformation as part of my dissertation on it. 
[00:50:30]  And that just kind of got quoted by Playboy randomly.  And once Playboy quotes you, that's the word.  That's what they call it.  Wow, man.  I don't even know where to begin.  Well, the tats.  Where did it start?  It started on my back, actually.  My back was a test piece because I designed it.  Did you have the idea to do your whole body and start it with the back?  Or are you just one of those things where you... 
[00:51:00]  I designed my entire body out and said,  this is going to be my art project, this thing that I'm going to do.  I started when I was 18.  By the time I was 21, I had it designed.  I thought it out and decided, yeah, I'm going to do it.  Did you just feel like you were an ugly guy or something  and said, I'm going to just alter my body?  I figured I was sexy, but I could be even sexier.  Wow, you've got balls.  Because that's kind of one of those things that you do  that really needs a lot of thought beforehand  because you're sacrificing, I don't know, assimilating.  To me, it's a commitment as an artist. 
[00:51:30]  I looked at his art when I came into it as a student.  I always said, you know, you can paint a painting, walk away from it.  Make a sculpture, somebody buys it, takes it away.  You know, you can always move away from your art.  But if you live your art, if you work with your body as a medium,  you show that you have a commitment to your ideas  and the messages and the things that you're doing.  You could also discover that you're just a bad artist.  Well, yeah.  I think you're stuck with a bad painting on your body.  If you suck, you suck.  It worked out for you, but I'm sure there's other people  that it was an experiment that went horribly wrong. 
[00:52:00]  Like, oh, damn, I had no talent whatsoever.  Well, just like you guys getting on the radio,  any sort of performer, any sort of entertainer,  any kind of artist, you have to be,  I think you have to take that plunge.  And if you suck, then you've got to, afterwards,  you've got to suck it up and say,  oh, it's too bad I sucked,  but at least I had the guts to give it a shot.  You've got to go for it.  Well, he's a lizard man, and he looks like a lizard.  He's got green tattoos all over his body,  like in the form of kind of like a scale.  Like a snake scale.  Well, let's get the obvious question  you're asked a thousand times out of the way. 
[00:52:30]  Where was the most painful part?  A thousand and one.  It's the nose.  The nose?  Right down here at the tip of the nose.  Doesn't take very long compared to, like, ribs or other areas,  but the intensity of that two and a half, three minutes  was incredible for the tattooing.  Really?  Easily the most painful tattooing.  Green penis?  No, not a green penis right now.  I've been playing around with different jewelry configurations,  and I just never got around to tattooing around them.  What?  Prince Albert?  I actually had an apodravia,  which is vertical all the way through the head. 
[00:53:00]  I've got a nasty scar from it now.  I used to take it out and hammer nails through it.  Wait, what is that?  I don't know.  I just...  A head split?  No, no, not split,  but a barbell that went in the bottom and came out the top.  I've since taken it out due to some scarring.  Ow!  All the way through.  Of what?  Ow!  My penis.  Your penis?  Oh, all right.  Fair enough.  It's the only piercing that's mentioned in the Kama Sutra, actually.  Oh!  Take a leak.  It looks like a spit take.  No, it's actually, you know,  just like a river going around a big tree.  Really?  Yeah, that's right.  Is that how that works?  Is that your girl out there?  No, that's one of the people from the Jaeger crew that's traveling with us on tour. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  My girl's back in Texas.  Is she just like a regular?  She's probably just regular.  Did she fall in love with you before this or after this?  The first time she saw me, I was opening up for Godsmack in 99.  She saw me come out on stage in nothing but a Speedo with my hair on fire and swallow a sword,  and I guess that did it for her.  She said, I've got to meet this guy.  I had her backstage that night.  We had a long-distance relationship.  We've been married two years now.  She's just like a regular square?  Not really.  She's got all of her tattoos are urban legends,  like she's got kidney scars, like her kidneys were stolen, 
[00:54:00]  Kudzu Vine's choking her, but she works as an office manager.  So, yeah, when she dresses up, nobody knows.  She's like, my man is the lizard man, bitch.  See, you went with the...  All you jealous hoes.  You can't put on a suit and a tie and look like you don't have tats or anything.  I can't look like I don't have tats,  but now I can look like I've got a better suit than most people,  and I'm having more fun, definitely.  And what's up with the eyebrows?  These are Teflon implants.  I've got five pieces over each eye to make these horned ridges right here. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, what are they, little balls?  They're carved out.  They look like the tips of bullets.  They're carved out to be horned-like.  They just go under the skin like that.  And they're just sticking straight out.  And who does that?  These were done by Steve Hayworth, who pretty much pioneered it.  He's a former biomedical device engineer who really got into body art,  and a great guy.  He's actually, if you look at, like, plastic surgery,  one of the things he's done is the tools for eye reconstruction  for people who have horrible eye injuries.  He invented and designed those tools for surgeons years ago.  That's right, Robin.  But his own interest was to do things like putting horns on people. 
[00:55:00]  And what about the eyelids?  Is that just makeup?  No, this is all tattooed.  Your eyelids are tattooed?  I don't do makeup.  I don't.  One of my hallmarks is I will not do anything that is not permanent and not real.  How the hell do they tattoo your eyelids?  Close your eye, pull the skin down, and work very carefully.  God damn.  Because it's right in the corners of your eyes.  Oh, yeah.  I told her, the woman that did it for me, I was like, get in there.  I want everything.  Make it green.  Wow.  I saw the show on TV where, whatever it was called, 
[00:55:30]  where you guys turn into animals, whatever.  Yeah.  And you seem like one of the normal ones, man.  That was one of the things they really put.  There was a guy that was like, looks like a cat or something or a lion.  Yeah, his real name is Dennis.  What was he trying to do, a cat?  Yeah, he's a Huron Indian, and he believes it's his totem animal.  And so he wants to make that transformation.  But he's got whiskers that are implanted and all that crap.  Yeah, I've seen that.  He lives his life like a, I don't know.  He really does try to live like a cat. 
[00:56:00]  I've hung out with him in San Diego.  We actually have the same agent.  He seemed a little creepy on that show.  Some of the guys that are doing it do have sort of a weird background  or do have some family history.  I mean, my thing is I always approached it as an artist and an entertainer.  I'm here to do my art, but at the same time entertain people and do it.  So right now I'm doing kind of sideshow and stunt comedy and things like that.  But some of the other guys that do it, they're very much, they're personal and spiritual.  I just don't have any of that kind of baggage on me.  What made you choose the lizard? 
[00:56:30]  It was a combination of different things.  Mainly it was aesthetic.  I like the way reptiles look, and I thought it would be a good way.  And design-wise, I was looking at my body, I'm like, what's going to cover this as a pattern?  And I thought about polka dots.  I thought about doing a full-body maze at one time.  But the one that stuck with me that I really kind of liked every time I looked at the drawings and everything,  I was like, I like the reptile thing, and it brought everything else together,  like the split tongue and the sharpened teeth.  Well, yeah, we forgot about the teeth.  They're all filing down into points, and the tongue is split.  Holy shit. 
[00:57:00]  Wow.  Wow, you could move each part of the split separately.  I can lick both sides at once.  It's split how much, about an inch?  Probably about an inch, inch and a half.  Depends on, you know, the way you hold your tongue makes it extend more or less,  but let's say about an inch is probably fair.  Yeah, and then he's got his earlobe stretched out, too.  Damn.  They're definitely an inch.  Unbelievable, man.  Yeah, those are huge.  And your talents, also along with, you know, the tats, you do things, 
[00:57:30]  I was looking at the blockhead thing.  Single most complete sideshow performer in history.  Yeah?  Yep.  Not only nails, you know, any hack can do it with just the nail.  That's where people start out.  You start off with small nails, work bigger and bigger.  But scissors?  Scissors.  Screwdrivers.  I open and close the scissors inside my head, too.  I can actually tweak them in and out.  They're out there in the case.  We'll get them in there.  Cutlery?  A running power drill? 
[00:58:00]  Running power drill.  This is, you know, I've been so looking forward to coming here,  because everywhere else I go with a running power drill,  and I can never, I never get to say it, but yeah, when you come see a Lizardman show,  you get to see a tattooed freak skull fuck himself for your pleasure.  God damn.  Unbelievable.  Do you make a good living doing this?  I'm doing all right.  I spend about nine, ten months out of the year on tour.  I do, obviously, the Jägermeister Music Tours.  I've been their official host since 2003. 
[00:58:30]  Right.  When I'm not with them, I'm doing tattoo conventions, corporate events,  and then on my own I hit the smaller rock clubs,  and I've got a couple of brave comedy clubs that have brought me in now and then.  You got a video out?  Actually, I won't do video of the show because it's meant to be a live experience.  I do have sketch videos and stuff that are downloadable in different parts of the Internet.  What is smashing fingers with soup cans?  You just take a metal soup can,  and usually I get a lovely volunteer from the audience to hold my arm down,  and I smash it on my finger until I've either dented the can or broken my finger. 
[00:59:00]  So far, the can's lost every time because I still got my fingers.  So are you the, like, in comparing, like, as you use the comedy world,  are you, like, the Richard Pryor of this shit, or are you the fucking Gallagher of this shit?  Like, is there another guy going, ah, that lizard man ain't shit?  Actually, you know, there's probably a lot of guys that, well, I say a lot of guys,  there's maybe only a dozen people in the world that really do what I do,  and we're fairly competitive, but the guys here in New York, Coney Island,  are really good friends of mine. 
[00:59:30]  They're more traditionalists, and a lot of people don't approach it the way I do.  I try to approach it from more of a stand-up point of view that I use personal stories  as to illustrate how I do the stunts, whereas the traditional thing is there's a pitch,  and everybody uses the same old jokes, like, you're pounding the nail,  like, this is a good way to get iron into your system.  Why don't I do that?  I talk about people picking their noses and peeing in the shower.  I talk about my experiences with bad roommates and people doing ugly stuff.  I guess one of the guys is, like, the Enigma would be another one of the guys that has the name, you know.  He's more, he does his stuff all set to music now. 
[01:00:00]  Did you get pissed off when he was in the X-Files?  No, actually, I figure any time you get somebody out there that's doing, you know,  freak art, slideshow, stuff like that, I take the view it's good for everybody.  You know, the more we get out there and the more we do stuff, you know,  the more you can get people out to a club to see you, everybody's going to benefit.  You know, let's be cool.  There's too few of us.  Like I say, there's literally less than a dozen of us who make our full-time living doing this.  There's no room to be an asshole at this point.  Well, let's say hi to Josh in Iowa. 
[01:00:30]  Josh?  Get this dude some Blue Power 8 beer and a hose.  He'll show you what Lizard Juice is all about.  He's seen the show.  Oh, yeah?  What's Lizard Juice about?  Lizard Juice is a concoction I used to offer my fans at the end of the show.  It was the final stunt.  We'd run six feet of clear tubing up my nose.  I'd swallow it down into my stomach.  It's attached to a pump.  We pour all these different things in, bong water, mustard, chocolate syrup.  It gets pumped into my stomach.  I can mix it around, regurgitated by being pulled up out of me in the tube. 
[01:01:00]  Pull that tube out, put it in a cup, pour me about a pint glass.  We give shots out to anybody in the audience who wants to come on stage.  Have a big toast to end the show and chug it down.  You would actually get people to drink this shit that would be in your stomach.  One of the reasons we stopped doing it is because people would rush the stage.  They wanted to get that shot of my stomach contents.  Why?  Hey, it's a weird thing.  You get up on stage, people want to be there with you. 
[01:01:30]  Holy shit.  Isn't that amazing?  Well, can we do some stuff today?  Definitely.  I've got my case just sitting up there.  Let me run out and grab the props.  The case.  Yes, the case.  And you're on tour with Disturbed and Corrosion of Conformity?  Yep.  Disturbed and Corrosion of Conformity through this leg, and then Disturbed will come back  for the second leg until February 23rd, starting in January.  Right.  Where are you guys performing tonight?  We are at Nokia tonight.  That's right.  Okay.  I think a bunch of us are going to see Disturbed and Corrosion of Conformity.  Wow.  It's a fantastic show.  You know, a lot of times on the tours, you'll take a break, like when the band's on, 
[01:02:00]  because I'm just out there putting the bands on the stage.  I'll do my 15 minutes, get them out there, and then run to the bus.  These guys have been hanging out in the venue every night.  There we go.  The metal case.  All the toys.  The trees has one of those.  Here, while I get this out, you guys might actually enjoy that.  Probably fits in well with your Whip It Out Wednesday.  I have a program of my own that said, if you can't beat them, manipulate them.  So that's my pitch to get Christians to show me their tits.  Show your tits for Jesus.  That's right.  In the beginning, Adam and Eve were naked and knew no shame. 
[01:02:30]  Only through original sin, eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge,  did they come to see that they were naked and become ashamed of their naked bodies.  It was in their shame, hiding from God because of their nakedness,  that they were discovered and cast from the Garden of Eden.  He just pulled out a Phillips head screwdriver, a pair of scissors,  your normal haircutting scissors, and a fork.  Well, we're going to tape this for the Internet so people can at least take a look  at what the hell Lizard Man is all about here. 
[01:03:00]  A hook.  Power drill.  There's the drill.  Space here.  A little 9.6-volt Black & Decker.  Beautiful drill.  My 9-volt electric nose picker.  Is there any trickery here, Lizard Man?  I will say that I'm taking out my septum jewelry.  That's the piercing that's in my septum, but it has nothing to do with the act,  just so you can see how big that is.  You can kind of do that.  Ah!  Holy shit.  He just took a Sharpie and put it in one nostril, 
[01:03:30]  and it came out the other nostril sideways,  like a bone-through-the-nose type piercing.  Let's see where to start.  The fork is small.  That's through.  What we're going to do now is in.  This is the old fork.  This is a great dinner trick for the kids.  You just kind of lean back and...  Ah, yeah.  He just put a fork in his head.  There you go.  He's put a fork in his head.  A fork completely, almost to the eating part. 
[01:04:00]  This is kind of like the starter kit.  Yeah, after the nails, when people learn the blockhead, this is what they do.  I need to take that out.  How far did that just go in?  Not that far.  Yeah, what would you say, like three inches, four inches?  That's a little more than four.  It's probably about five.  Five inches straight into the entire handle of a fork.  Where's it going?  Yeah, that's where I want to ask you.  There's a space in there?  There's a lower sinus passage that goes straight back.  That's the one that connects with the inside of the back of your throat.  Yeah.  You know, when you get a cold, everybody feels that drip in the back of your throat. 
[01:04:30]  Right.  I'm going straight back above the soft palate.  It's back in the head.  I can actually feel it, like, underneath my eyes.  I sometimes do this act with a live snake and have the snake crawl out my mouth.  Uh-huh.  And I can feel it crawling around in that passage underneath my eyes.  That's the hole where you go...  It went down the wrong way.  Yeah.  Oh, whoo.  He sticks things down the wrong way.  It went down the wrong pipe.  Actually, to give you a better idea of where the passage is,  the hook will show it better because you'll be able to, looking at it visually,  kind of feel it in that same way.  Okay.  I don't want to, though. 
[01:05:00]  It's the worst fishing accident in history right here.  So he's got a huge hook.  And he has snot running down his nose, so this is serious business.  And he's sliding it into his nostril.  Now he's turning it around.  And now it's out his mouth.  There you go.  Holy crap!  That's what I'm talking about.  What do you think, Patrice?  That's what I'm talking about.  Obviously, these are some visuals, but Steve's got the camera rolling.  Well, that is a huge hook.  How come watching it, you get that feeling in your taint?  The heebie-jeebies?  What is that about the human, like, system where you see something like that, 
[01:05:30]  and you get, like, this tingle in your taint?  It's that visceral response.  It's that you can't look at another human being,  even if they're tattooed green with horns on their face,  and not think, oh, what if that was happening to me?  Ah, a little snotty-faced lizard man sticking things in his soft hole palate.  Yeah, you got a tissue?  Get this man some tissue.  All right, here's the...  Nothing wrong with a booger.  Everybody picks their nose, right?  The only bad thing about picking your nose is, of course, 
[01:06:00]  every now and then you get that nose hair,  and it plucks out with it, and it hurts like hell.  Yeah.  Now, let's see, just trim them a little bit.  Let's get that in there.  Oh, he's putting a scissor.  Why don't you get in there deep?  You just got to kind of...  Oh, don't open and close the scissor.  He's opening and closing the scissor.  You are a maniac.  As it is, it's way in his nostril.  And you leave him open when you're bulletin' it out.  Like four inches in minimum.  He's probably a millimeter from something dangerous.  Yeah, how close are you to...  Yeah, like snipping.  Yeah, I've probably had better ideas than my time. 
[01:06:30]  You're going to snip his fucking spine one day  and just collapse in somebody's studio.  Watch this clip.  Oh, shit.  That just turns into a puddle in front of your eyes.  As drunk as I get on stage,  I think they've got a wheelchair waiting anyway, so...  The Ongongovain.  We didn't realize the Ongongovain  was right in the nostril casing.  Fucking opening close.  And he also, by the way...  Wow.  Another thing that's given me the heebie-jeebies  is how he licks clean everything he pulls out of his nose.  I'm a very sanitary lizard. 
[01:07:00]  Now, there is a drill bit going into...  I just want to give you a little bit of sound.  This is nice.  All right, he's got a power drill.  Going in the nose again.  Straight in the nostril.  Oh, my God.  Straight in the nostril to the back of the head.  He's pushing, he's pushing, he's pushing.  Power drill all the way in,  and now he's working the power drill.  That's where I work it in.  Holy shit.  I cannot fucking deal.  Oh, my God.  There you go. 
[01:07:30]  Wow.  Bravo.  That's impressive.  Yeah, we should have actually...  We probably should have started here  because it's a safety first kind of thing, right?  Yeah.  We should have started off with the condom.  And like I said,  you come to the show,  you get to see somebody skullfuck themselves  with a power drill.  Yeah.  Because we've got the alcohol,  you know,  we try to do responsibility messages,  but the condom's a universal symbol of responsibility.  But what I do with the condom  is actually pretty irresponsible.  It's not as irresponsible as fucking fat chicks,  but it's still pretty irresponsible.  He's unrolling the condom.  Yeah, you've got to unroll it. 
[01:08:00]  Show bad for fat chicks.  Fat woman out there  where the lizard man even puts you down.  Yeah, you fat bitches.  Give me that rat sack.  I'm just giving some back.  You know,  I've had my career choices questioned by bums.  We were in San Francisco on tour.  A bum came up to me and goes,  is that a tattoo?  And he's like,  I'm like, yeah, it's a tattoo.  He goes,  how are you ever going to get a job?  I'm like,  you just asked me for a quarter, motherfucker.  How are you going to get a job?  And how sick are you of hearing that exact question?  Oh, exactly. 
[01:08:30]  People are like,  how are you going to get a job?  We didn't go there  because obviously you're making a great living doing this.  Get off my property.  I own a house.  What are you doing?  That's going to be for a quarter.  This is the type of shit  that makes me wish I could live forever  just to see him as a 80-year-old,  wrinkly-the-tattooed lizard man and shit.  He's going to be thrilling shit  and sticking things in his face.  Old folks home,  I'll be rolling my wheelchair around  chasing chicks with my tongue out.  Come on, nurse.  That tongue is great, though.  That whole,  it didn't scare me.  It was like,  wow,  the things you can do.  Oh, he's snorting.  Oh!  He snorted a,  unrolled,  snorted the unrolled tongue.  Now, that was weird feeling. 
[01:09:00]  Right up to the,  and now it pulled it out of his,  he's flossing his insides now.  Can you,  can you,  wait, wait,  we've got to explain for the radio.  You've got to remember to floss, kids.  The condo went in the nostril  and out the mouth  and then he held it on both ends.  Oh, my God.  He snorted the condo.  And went to back and forth there.  And what usually happens  when I do that,  and, well,  we haven't got any girls in it,  so there's always this one chick  that'll scream out,  that's gross,  which happens actually a lot  during the show.  This one,  I love it, though,  because it turns me on,  because the only way a girl  can know how gross this is,  is if she's had a condom 
[01:09:30]  in her mouth before.  Ah.  Oh.  That's the one I'm looking for,  usually.  Can you choke?  Is it possible you can choke?  Oh, yeah,  it's very easy to choke.  If I miss the turn,  if I have to manipulate it  by the pressure inside my head,  if I miss the turn,  it'll get into my airway  and then it's like having  a balloon caught in your throat  and it'd be very easy to choke.  How about just regular eating?  You couldn't choke,  just regular eating or something.  Just regular choking,  eating from doing  sword swallowing  and other things.  As a side show,  I've got pretty good control.  I can usually cough something  up or down,  however I want.  Do you get any infections?  How do you prevent that crap? 
[01:10:00]  I just try and stay  as healthy as I can,  you know?  But it then knocks all nine  on that fucking condom  that clears the lid.  This should kill sperm.  It should kill everything else,  right?  Here's the reverse.  All right,  now he's sticking the condom  completely in his mouth,  shoving it deep in,  and now he's going to  suck it out his nose,  it looks like.  Here he goes.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  He's blowing a big condom bubble.  I don't care where you go,  a guy with a condom 
[01:10:30]  hanging out of his nose  is pretty fucking cool.  Yeah,  I gotta give you that.  Lizard man,  that rocks.  And now he's pulling  it out of his nostril.  Shit,  gotta wrap that up  through the responsible thing.  Oh,  wow.  Hey,  you do the dart trick?  I shouldn't call them tricks.  Yeah,  they're not tricks really,  they're stunts.  Yeah,  I know they're not tricks.  Yes,  we do do the darts on stage.  We've done that.  Really?  We had a guy come in  and he wanted to plug his business  so we said,  alright,  let us throw darts at your back  and every dart that's, 
[01:11:00]  you know,  we hit you in the back with  you could plug your business.  Yeah,  we like taped some newspaper  over his spine.  That's fair trade,  I believe.  That's fair trade.  So we wouldn't paralyze him  and then we threw him,  I hit him in the shoulder blade  with one I swear  like clunk  where it hit his bone.  Yeah,  we do that for the crowd  actually before disturbed.  We give them the,  that's their chance  to yell and scream  and get remembered by the dude.  We give them a few in the back  and then I take a few  in the chest and the stomach.  So we just kind of spin around  like a whirly game  and let him go.  The tattoos are well done too.  Like they're smooth 
[01:11:30]  and you know,  it just looks.  Yeah,  yeah,  it's good work.  It's not like all weird work.  You get a better look  at the rest of it.  Very good work.  He's taking off his hoodie.  Yeager hoodie.  Holy crap.  Wow.  That is pretty cool.  With the word  almost any jip  across his chest.  Actually,  when I turn around  you see on my back  there's different parts  of my back  that are scarred up  in the black.  They're actually not mistakes  in the tattoos.  They're the scars  from darts  and from hanging by hooks.  Oh,  you do the hook  on your back  and like every lizard  he's a little chubby. 
[01:12:00]  A little flabby snake, man.  A little reserved  for the winter.  What do you need to do?  Well,  you still have  the piece of antelope there  that hasn't fucking digested.  This is Tony Danco.  Where he constricted somebody  and it's like,  hey,  it's still...  It's amazing  that at 145 pounds  I'm getting weight comments  from Patrice.  Isn't it?  That fucking Patrice.  I can't believe it.  I know I'm a mess  but I thought  the snake man  was going to be all,  you know,  cranky. 
[01:12:30]  Well,  his whole body's tattooed.  We got video  that Steve's...  It was amazing.  Well,  I noticed that  you didn't just go  with an entire body  of scales.  Well,  it seemed to me  like I needed  to break it up  a little bit  so I looked at  different things  that were out there  and I thought  that some different  markings would be good  and there was  sort of a practical thing  like I said,  we started with my back piece  that,  you know,  when I designed it  I'd never had a tattoo  so I didn't know  if I was going to sit down  and be the ultimate pussy  and go like,  ow,  no,  I can't do this  and screw up  the whole project.  Have one green scale 
[01:13:00]  on your back  for the rest of your life?  So what we decided  to do was start off  from one of these  black pieces  you'll make it  through the whole thing.  So I was like,  start with my shoulder blade  and he drilled it out  and I was like,  okay,  that's not what I'd call fun  but I can do this.  And it's just like  a tattoo of a black mesh  that starts the whole thing  and then they fill it in  with the green.  So I've seen,  you know,  you've still got black mesh  on your chest  but what about the other  like the swirly black things?  Yeah,  those are just the markings  and I figured it'd be nice  to kind of break it up  and have something there. 
[01:13:30]  I've also,  I've just really always been a fan  too of the visuals  of large heavy black tattooing  the different cultures  they come from.  I'm like,  that's a good look.  It's a good design.  And most of it is visual  because it's a visual art form  as a performer.  Because it does almost have  like some kind of  Egyptian look to it.  It's clean, man.  It's really clean.  They're partially motivated  by different island cultures.  Like I say,  some of the Egyptian,  the mosaics  and things that are out there.  Which is your very first tattoo?  Is it visible?  Is these shoulder pieces.  The upper back.  Upper back.  And you was empty before that.  Absolutely clear. 
[01:14:00]  All I had before that was  I'd had my ears pierced.  Are you done tattooing?  No,  I've got probably  about 700 hours in  and another 200 to go.  What are you going to do next?  Just fill in the empty scales.  Yeah.  All these scales  will be filled in  completely green.  Oh,  it's not going to be the mesh.  Yeah,  yeah.  This is right now.  This is just the in progress.  It's just a matter  of getting that all filled in.  And that has to heal  for a little while  and then to the next.  It takes me,  I can usually do  about eight to ten hours  at a time  and that takes about  a week,  week and a half  to heal fully.  And then we're good.  Damn. 
[01:14:30]  Wow.  I think I can get  this strap around  this chair  and show you the ears.  All right.  Actually,  you know what would  even be better  for weight  if you can help me?  I can probably  pull him with my ears.  Holy shit.  Patrice,  how much do you weigh?  I weigh about  upwards of  three.  Upwards of three.  He's putting  just to get a visual.  Through his ear piercing,  he's putting  those big  like parachute  fastening clips.  That's like the clips  that hold  your parachute canopy on. 
[01:15:00]  All right.  Now he's got  Patrice  and big straps  and Patrice  on the chair.  And now.  Ah!  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  He just pulled Patrice  with his earlobe piercing.  Across the studio.  Oh, my dear,  sweet Lord.  I tell you,  I don't believe him.  I think he's playing  up the fat man angle.  He in a pound  over 280.  At a pound  over 280.  He has the strength  of a thousand snakes.  That's pretty impressive.  He's fucking...  God damn. 
[01:15:30]  You know,  with great power  comes great responsibility.  You know that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's pretty impressive.  Actually,  I hold the Guinness...  Are you not going  to snap the earlobe  doing that?  No,  I've actually built  these up over time.  I can do a deadlift  of around 50 to 60 pounds.  And I set a record  that Guinness is now  deciding if they'll  certify or not.  I pulled a Geo Metro  the length of a football  field in my ears  last summer.  For a car commercial  and they didn't give it to me.  It was an audition taping  and they didn't give me 
[01:16:00]  the spot.  Why didn't they give you  the spot?  They thought it was  too extreme that people  would be turned off by it.  They look bad  like if your Metro  breaks down,  you need this guy  to pull you to a service day.  When are they going  to show it during  Everybody Loves Raymond's?  Right after his little...  Some towing company  ought to be on the phone  to me right now.  Are you making up  your own medical...  Are you just deciding?  Just now you pulled me  but did you make a decision  that your ears  can withstand  that kind of thing?  You made a decision  or somebody said  you can do this?  Lifting stuff with piercings 
[01:16:30]  has actually been around  popularly for about 200 years.  There's a guy named  Rasmus Nielsen  in the 1700s  that was doing anvils  and pulling people  in wagons.  So yeah.  I look around the world  and anytime I see somebody  do something,  this is how I got started.  I started out  as a fire eater,  fire breather,  bed of nails and stuff  when I was in high school.  I was just really curious.  I was like,  if your body can do that,  can my body do that?  And I wanted to push myself  and find my limits.  And it became,  now I've been doing this  for more than 15 years  that I've reached a level. 
[01:17:00]  It's kind of like  a sprinter doesn't start off  being world class.  But if they train really hard  and do it forever,  they reach a level  that most other people  will never get to.  What's the one stunt  you hate doing?  The stunt that,  probably one of the worst stunts  because it's the one  that goes wrong  the most often  is putting my hand  into a steel raccoon trap.  Because it's very easy.  What you want to do  is when you get your hand  in there,  it snaps down  and I'm trying to get it  on the flats of the bones  to minimize it.  But the distance is such  that I hit my knuckles  all the time  and I end up  with these big swollen knuckles. 
[01:17:30]  And of course,  I'll usually do  at least two shows a night  or at least five or six shows  in a week.  So to come back  the next day  with your knuckle busted  like you just punched  a brick wall  and have to put it back  in a trap  kind of sucks.  Oh, wow.  And hanging from the meat hooks,  that's no big deal?  Hanging from the hooks  I actually enjoy.  I do that for fun,  basically.  Now that is no trick  at all.  There are actual hooks  that go in your back.  The only picture  I have with me  right now  is on my phone.  Do you guys want to... 
[01:18:00]  Look at that.  Pass it around.  Yeah, those are  two nine-gauge hooks  I hung 150 feet  off a crane  over the Gulf of Mexico  with a bunch of my buddies.  And the skin's  not going to split.  What it is  is you need  a thick enough  gauge of a hook.  Yeah.  And the tensile strength  of skin  is much more  than people think.  You are bleeding  like a motherfucker.  Yeah, after coming down  the tension's taken off  so it allows  the blood  to flow out.  Doing suspension  is, like I say,  it's fun for us  and if you do it correctly  you've got to learn  where to pierce  what equipment to use.  The group that I work with, 
[01:18:30]  TSD,  is the oldest,  longest running group  of suspenders.  What does that stand for?  Traumatic Stress Discipline.  And we're the team  that did Ripley's as well,  did the crane mobile  for them  and assisted  on the helicopter  flight for Joey Strange.  Right.  You know,  basically modern suspension  especially in the West  comes through the group.  You working on any new tricks?  I'm always working on  I've been working on  New stunts, sorry.  No, new stunts.  Yeah, you know,  it's a set.  I think people  people do get it  when I come out  because I open the show  coming out with a deck of cards 
[01:19:00]  and the first thing I say  is I'm like,  alright, you know,  I get the audience up there  and we go through the whole thing  setting up a card trick  and all I say is I'm like,  alright,  go find a fucking magician  because I don't do card tricks.  Everything you're going to see  from here on out is real.  Right.  And they understand it  and so what I'm working on now  is a lot of different things  because I've had to basically  take fire out of my accent  since Great White  so I'm replacing those elements.  What a bummer.  Yeah.  Great White ruined everything.  Hottest act in the world  for 40 seconds  and then everybody else suffers.  I get a key.  You know there's a little girl  that does, 
[01:19:30]  I don't know her name  but she scratches her eyeball.  You ever...  Scratches her eyeball?  She scratches her fucking eyeball.  Right out of her head.  And chews her fingers  down to the bone.  To the bone, man.  You know what?  That sounds like OCD really.  She's only like four.  I think it's Gabby.  Her name's Gabby  and she told me to tell you  I'm a fucking hack.  I had a story on the news yesterday.  Gabby will be working for me  in six months.  Get her out of her head.  I had a story on the news yesterday  just to help you along here.  A girl that doesn't feel any pain.  She feels no pain.  She's like five  or something like that. 
[01:20:00]  So her parents I guess  weren't watching her  as well as they should have  and she was chewing her fingers  until it got right down  to the bone just about.  So they pulled all her teeth out  and then she was scratching her eyeball.  This sounds like model parenting  right here to me.  She was scratching her eyeball  and she did that to the point  where her eye was so damaged  that had to be removed.  So she's slowly just kind of  disassembling herself.  Just taking pieces away from her.  Now that I'd pay to see.  Because of bad parenting. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Your parents into what you do?  Actually my parents came  and they'd seen me on TV before.  My dad helped me build  my first bed of nails.  He was basically my first consultant  for sort of some of the engineering.  What a great father-son project.  Yeah.  Build a bed of nails.  Love is love, isn't it?  It is what it is.  Some of them build  the soapbox derby cars.  Are your parents squared?  You do that too.  Regular squared?  My dad is a mountain warfare instructor  for the 110 division in the army  and my mom is a retired  elementary school teacher.  Wow.  Wow.  That should have turned out  just like a soldier kid. 
[01:21:00]  I actually turned down  an appointment to the Naval Academy  to go to art school.  Really?  Yep.  Very good.  I was a National Merit Scholar,  varsity athlete.  Wow.  You know, I'm like,  dude, for me it's all about  the performance and the art.  What did you do?  I played soccer and tennis  in high school  and then I played  eight years of rugby  when I got out  between college and...  Tough motherfucker.  Yeah, I guess that makes  a great sport.  I was a hooker.  Eight years of hooking.  I got the bad vertebrae  to prove it.  Right on.  Any other stunts  you want to do 
[01:21:30]  before we move on here?  I got a couple of things  that fit my nose  if you want.  I got the screwdriver.  This one, actually,  I put my thing like it.  This one's kind of cool.  This is,  because lots of people  will do screwdrivers  and other tools,  but this one took me  a little bit of control  to get, so you'll see  the moment when you see  the part that's  a little different.  Instead of just sliding  in, you go about partway  and you kind of...  Let it slide in.  Wow.  You got to actually  release the sinus patches  and it drop down.  Right.  And then you kind of... 
[01:22:00]  Very nice.  You let it slide right in  and then back out of his...  And then he licks it.  God damn.  You got to have the flourish, man.  That is some fucked up shit.  Someone has a great question.  How much has the tattooing  cost you?  Most of my tattooing  has been done  on a friendly basis.  What would it be  if just normal...  Oh, if it was an insurance quote,  it would be pushing  a quarter million dollars.  Wow.  Because we did that  for some show,  wanted to know,  and they actually took me  to an insurance adjuster  and he figured out  the hourly rate  of the tattoo artist 
[01:22:30]  versus what it would take  to repair and everything else.  And they're like,  yeah, we'd probably want  a quarter million from you  to insure it.  And what one guy  while you were?  I've been broken up  by two guys.  I started out  in upstate New York  for the first couple of years,  but I moved to Texas.  I had a friend of mine  in Dallas take over the work.  So it's been basically  Mad Pup in upstate  and then Mike Tidwell in Dallas.  Where in upstate New York?  Plattsburgh.  Oh, Plattsburgh.  Okay.  I actually grew up  30 miles northwest  of Plattsburgh  before I went to high school.  All you got to do  is plug them  and that's your payment  is just to plug them?  Yeah, I'm just 
[01:23:00]  the walking billboard.  Yeah.  They'd probably do it  if I never said anything.  Do you know Scorch?  Scorch?  Oh, up in...  Everyone knows Scorch  from the kingdom of nakedness.  Scorch!  Scorch, how you doing, man?  What's going on, guys?  What's up, Scorch?  Not much.  We're just kind of chilling out.  I'm glad you got a lizard man.  Hey, lizard man,  what up, man?  Scorch is one of our radio friends.  He does morning radio  in Syracuse, New York.  But I don't sound like  I'm having a constipation fit.  We all like imitating Scorch  around here. 
[01:23:30]  It's one of our favorite past tires.  The naked militia.  Well, is it...  Yeah, it's the naked militia now?  Yeah, the naked militia.com.  And you're going to be having  a naked militia Christmas party?  Yeah, and you guys  are more than invited.  I thought you already said  you were coming up, right?  Yeah, of course we will.  We'll be the only two there.  Are we on the air  with you guys again?  Not just yet.  You will be in a second.  Right now we're playing  Aretha Franklin...  What's her name?  Roberta Flack.  What song?  I don't know how to love him. 
[01:24:00]  Wait, what happened to you?  Have you guys changed format again?  Every time I go up there  and see him for the convention  in Syracuse,  he's got three new formats.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I'm just joking.  Right now we're playing Metallica.  Oh, okay.  You're scared of us.  I'm like,  what happened to our pal Scorch?  Here's Roberta Flack,  ladies and gentlemen.  You can do it, though.  So what's going on  in the world of satellite radio?  We're loving Lizard Guy over here, man.  Lizard Man.  Unbelievable.  Has he put your finger  through his nose yet?  No.  See, we usually find the girl 
[01:24:30]  that works at the radio station  and make her put her pinky  through my nose  without telling her  what's going on.  You want to see a girl  dance in one spot,  it's great.  Hey, Lizard Man,  you coming back up here  in January?  I actually can't make it this year  because the tour already has me.  From January 4th  through February 23rd  when I'm doing the second leg  of this tour  with Blood Simple Undisturbed.  Yeah.  Good for you, man.  Sorry, Scorch.  You're going to have to settle  for someone else.  Cockroach Guy.  Hey, Scorch,  what kind of radio bits  are you doing these days?  Well, you'll listen 
[01:25:00]  to our promos every day  on myspace.com  backslash the naked militia.  Today, we are doing nothing.  Hold on.  Someone just handed me  a Scorch demo.  I got Scorch  as one of my friends  on MySpace.  Do you really?  Of course.  We got some promos, I guess.  Oh, here we go.  Jesus.  This is Scorch,  the naked militia.  This is the show intro.  Scorch.  The naked militia.  This is to be played  at high volume  irreparably  in a residential area. 
[01:25:30]  Yes, it's wake up time.  Time to get up  and go to work.  Every morning,  get the sweet  out of your eyes  on the radio.  I want to bring out  a little surprise.  I feel a little crazy  about it.  My kind is go  get in the car  and turn it up.  Let's go.  Five minutes  after six o'clock.  Warm morning, man.  73 already  heading up to  about 95 to 100 today.  I mean,  no offense,  but that's just  a little toasty for me.  And it is  Syracuse's rock station 
[01:26:00]  with the best classic rock  and the best new rock.  Ho-ho!  It's rock with a five-and-dollar.  All right, listen to me.  That's nice.  Listen to me.  The best classic rock  and the best new rock?  Well, I get paid  $14 an hour  to say that.  I love when commercial  radio stations  say that stuff, though.  It's like,  why are you playing  the best classic rock  and the best new rock  and all the other stations  are purposely picking out  the worst classic rock?  We're not playing 
[01:26:30]  the best of anything,  believe me.  They're playing  the obscure fog hat  because they just  don't know any better?  Not playing the best  of anything.  Listen to them bashing.  That is why  I can't wait  until the third week  of January  when I finally get  on XM full-time.  Is that what's going on,  Scorch?  I'm not really  able to say.  Not at Liberty?  We would know by now.  Yeah, you would know by now.  We're making all the decisions.  Don't you know that?  Come on over, man.  We're going to at some point.  I've got to wait  for Paul to finish up  with his contract.  He's working for  the Gay Radio Network. 
[01:27:00]  I always hear you guys  talk about guys in radio  that sit and listen  to XM and Dream.  I'm that guy.  Yeah, I know everyone  is listening to XM out there.  This used to be the  this used to be like  the goof of radio,  satellite radio,  years ago.  Yeah.  People on regular radio  looked at it like,  oh, well,  satellite radio.  Now it's at the point  where who doesn't  want to come over here  and be able to speak  your mind,  do what the fuck  you want,  and just have a blast.  Oops, are you on the air now? 
[01:27:30]  No, but that's just so cool  to hear someone say that.  That's nothing.  It's a blast, man.  Well, just the fact,  you know,  and you guys said it  and we'll say it too.  If you get on satellite  just to say this or that,  then you're,  that's crap.  But if you,  just to be able to say  what's on your mind  without worrying about it,  God bless, man.  That's a good thing.  That's it.  Now everyone wants  to come over.  Do you have a bit called  Would You Let Ron Jeremy  Violate You?  Well, we did a bit  for $10 million.  It was a $10 million question.  Would you let Ron Jeremy  violate you  on your Thanksgiving table? 
[01:28:00]  It came up at one of our  pool parties  during the summer.  With a bunch of guys  talking about it.  In front of your parents  and everything?  Yeah, in front of your parents.  What about you guys?  Would you do it?  But how much did you get?  $10 million.  $10 million?  Yeah.  For Ron Jeremy  to buttfuck you  on the Thanksgiving table.  Excuse me,  we at Territorial,  Terrestrial Radio  prefer Violate.  Yeah, yeah,  but we all know  what that means.  Violate could be  he uses one of those  old 50s blackjacks  and takes your money.  You know?  We like being 
[01:28:30]  right to the point here.  That's right.  And let's see,  $10 million.  No!  What are you,  crazy?  $10 million bucks.  See, you got,  no, you got to ask  someone that's poor,  Scorch.  Yeah, exactly.  We make $10 million a week.  Believe me,  why do you think  I want a part of that?  Then you got to turn  around to Ron and go,  I don't know how to quit you!  What are you guys doing?  Yeah, you guys talking  about the gay cowboy movie yet?  Broke Brad,  Broke Back Mountain?  Oh, we talked about  that the other day. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  We were like,  doing little bits and pieces  on that.  Have you seen it?  It's wonderful.  Pauly is going to see it  for us because he'd  take care of all  the gay stuff on the show.  Yeah, we got to send  someone to the movie theater  as they're coming out  of Broke Back Mountain.  Hey, did you guys do  Feels for Meals this year?  No, once again,  we got shut down.  Again, they shut us down.  There's just no way  to get that one  off the ground.  See, we can't do everything  on satellite radio.  Prostitution is prostitution,  even in space.  Matter of fact,  the lawyers never got back  to us on Feels for Meals  this year. 
[01:29:30]  They didn't even bother.  Huh?  You should do it  for Christmas.  Well, we got the idea  for Christmas.  Are we going to do  Money Snatch?  Yeah, we want to do  the Money Snatch.  We're doing Money Snatch.  We got to start getting  women for the Money Snatch game.  We should do it next week  because Christmas  is almost here.  Yeah, let's start getting  women for the Money Snatch.  It's great.  It's like one of those things  where you put a woman  in a room full of money  and the money blows  all over the place  and the more she can grab  and come out with...  It's a cute bit.  All the morning zoos do it.  But ours is different.  They got to put it 
[01:30:00]  in their most intimate  of areas  if I could be radio safe.  And whether they roll it up  or shove it in,  whatever,  they have to come out  with the money  right up there  and then they get  to keep it.  They got to be  completely nude.  Totally nude.  Totally nude  for the Money Snatch.  So now,  in a couple of weeks  or so,  myself and Paul  are going to come down  and hang out  with you guys  in the studio.  Is that cool?  Nice.  Have the Scorch in with us.  Yeah.  You can hang out  and do the show  with us  the whole time  you're in New York.  And I promise you  that I won't bring  Gooner with me this time. 
[01:30:30]  Who the hell is that?  Remember Gooner,  the kid I brought with me  when you guys were  in New York City?  He was Gilligan  on the real Gilligan's Island.  Oh, hello.  You remember that kid?  I brought him  into the show with you.  Yeah, he came in.  We remember everyone  that comes by  and say hi to us.  Do you remember everybody?  Yeah, sure we do.  You remember Dave Dickless?  Yeah, he never came to visit.  Brucey Mittman did.  All right, Wayne,  we got some audio  of would you let  Ron Jeremy violate you?  All right,  let's see.  For $10 million,  would you let  Ron Jeremy violate you  in front of your parents  on the Thanksgiving Day table? 
[01:31:00]  Jeremy,  would you let him do it?  Sure I would.  And then after that,  they'd have to pay me  another $10.5 million  to let him stop.  Hey, John,  what's up, man?  Hey, how you doing, man?  How are you?  Yeah, I would definitely  let him stop  like a turkey.  Oh, Pete.  Hey, is that our own  Sam doing some voice work  for you?  We, what,  laughing and stuff?  No.  Sam wasn't here then. 
[01:31:30]  Sam wasn't here yet.  Oh, well,  you sound like Sam  a little bit then.  Yeah, Paulie definitely  sounds like Sam.  Paulie sounds a little bit  like Sam,  our old intern.  Yeah.  Who's now our new intern.  Sam's a good worker, though.  Sam is in the other studio  checking out our show today.  Do you think that  he's part black?  Yes.  Yeah, there's something  going on.  We were talking about that.  Yeah, Sam,  come on in and say hi.  We got a little  man in the studio.  We got Scorch on the phone  from Syracuse.  He's doing his morning show.  Are we simulcasted  to Syracuse right now?  Yeah.  All right.  We're on the air  with Scorch?  We're going to be  on the air in 50 seconds. 
[01:32:00]  50 seconds,  and then we'll keep it clean.  Well, when you guys  do your break,  just start talking, okay?  Yeah.  I'm going to trust you.  You're on delay, right?  I'm going to trust you.  No, we don't have a delay.  Oh.  Well, what if we promise  we won't curse this?  We won't curse.  No.  No.  So we're not going  to be on with you?  We might have you on  for a second.  You're all over the country.  At least give us  a little taste.  Give us Syracuse.  We swear we won't curse.  Okay. 
[01:32:30]  Hang on one second.  All right.  We've got Sam in the studio.  He used to work for us.  He now works for Scorch.  Hi, this is Sam!  Did he say hi to Lizard Man?  How's it going, Lizard Man?  Hi, Sam.  Rock 105, the dog.  Sherry uses Rock Station,  Scorch, and Paulie,  and we're being joined  by the big time.  I guess we can call it  the big time, right?  The guys who actually  make money in this business.  Of course,  they're not on  terrestrial radio,  that's why.  From XM Satellite Network, 
[01:33:00]  it's Opie and Anthony.  Scorch.  There he is,  our buddy Scorch.  Hey, thank you guys  for joining us.  I know that you really  don't like me  and you talk nasty about me,  but at least...  Why would you get that idea?  We've been pals  since the old  WAAF days in Boston.  I can honestly say  I listen to these guys  all the time.  They always have  nothing but nice things  to say about you.  Love the Scorch.  It's so good.  I live vicariously  through you,  and it's good that  I love to see  all the successes  you guys have had.  I love the Naked Militia.  I want to come  to the Naked Militia Party. 
[01:33:30]  What's the Naked Militia Party  all about?  We're going to have it  at Hooters.  It's going to be  this coming Monday night,  and it is going to be...  So you're going to hang out  with a bunch of  naked guys at Hooters.  Your career has really  taken off  since we've last seen you,  Scorch.  Well, now I'm with men.  Chicken wings  and naked men.  That's wonderful.  Some things don't change,  in other words.  I don't understand  about Scorch.  He started with  the Kingdom of Nakedness.  Right.  Now it's the Naked Militia,  but he doesn't 
[01:34:00]  actually get naked.  Do you want to  see me naked?  I don't want to  see you naked,  but I'm just thinking  if you're coming up  with this unbelievable  concept called  the Naked Militia,  that there'd be nudity  all over the goddamn place.  This shows you  where you're at,  because how do you know  he doesn't have chicks  in the Naked Militia?  Thank you, Anthony.  That are naked  walking around.  Because he does  the same type of show  we do,  and when we do  our appearances,  how many chicks  do you see, Anthony?  Two.  It's a sausage.  Two girls at your event?  Goddamn,  I want to be on satellite.  We have two girls.  No, I've never seen  a naked person yet. 
[01:34:30]  No?  Now what?  In the Militia.  We got Lizardman  in studio today, Joe.  Oh, that's right.  Hey, Lizardman.  How you doing, Scott?  He's helping out  disturbed.  Live in Syracuse,  good for you.  Who needs satellite  when you can be on  in the queues?  Right.  You know,  if the tour  didn't have me locked up,  you know I'd be back  up there for MGM again.  I love Genie,  and I love going up there  to see you guys.  No doubt.  You've definitely done  that remix you did  of the Snoop Dogg song  for me a couple years ago.  One of the best pieces  I've ever had done for me.  What was that?  He did the Holiday Inn song 
[01:35:00]  because we had the convention  at the Holiday Inn.  Replaced everything  with Lizardman.  It was chilling  with Lizardman  at the Holiday Inn.  He did the whole remix  up there.  I think that's,  you know,  he's spending all his hours  doing that.  You getting the 14 bucks  an hour for that too?  Well, I got,  that was on the house.  It was brutal.  It was part of my job  where they said,  you've got to go in the studio  and do something.  So I did.  But how's Syracuse treating you?  Yeah.  How's this commercial radio  working out for you?  I want to be on satellite radio.  Are you allowed to like  fart and stuff?  Yeah.  I mean,  I'm allowed to do 
[01:35:30]  a little bit more  than most,  luckily.  Because you're what they call  under the radar.  Yeah.  I'm not as excited  as other people have been,  but it's still not,  it's still,  I want to do talk radio.  Maybe the fact that our station  can't afford a program director.  Oh, really?  You don't have a program director  right now?  No, we don't have anything.  We broadcast out of a broom closet.  Nice.  No boss.  Hang on one second.  Let's not continue the music.  It's, uh...  Ah, you don't blame it, man.  You said you don't have  a program director,  you pussy.  Forget the music. 
[01:36:00]  Screw the music.  For once,  you got entertaining radio  and you're gonna go play,  what, Foghat or something?  Talk show, Scorch.  Talk show.  We're talking.  This is how we did it.  We blew off the music  no matter how bad  Brucey Mittman yelled at us.  That's right.  We didn't listen to anybody.  Brucey Mittman.  If you want to become  a talk show host,  you gotta just start talking.  You blow off the music.  What dumb song  do you have to play?  You know what?  I'm gonna blow it up.  What song did you  have to play there?  I'm gonna blow it up.  I was gonna play it live.  What was it?  What was it?  I was gonna play  Lightning Crashes from live,  but I'm just gonna blow it up.  Lightning Crashes. 
[01:36:30]  That's horrific.  Lightning Crashes.  Like, your listeners  want to hear that crappy song  one more time.  Lightning Crashes.  I can understand  if you blow us off  from Metallica  or God Smack  or Disturb,  but live?  Lightning Crashes.  We've been disturbed  in two years,  I don't think.  Why?  Really?  Yeah, we used to play that stuff.  What about Land of Confusion?  Yeah, we play  the Genesis version.  No.  You can't play  the Genesis version.  You haven't heard  Disturb do Land of Confusion yet?  Yeah, we have. 
[01:37:00]  We just can't play it.  Why?  It's one of those things.  Come on, Scorch,  you gotta break the rules, man.  Wait, what is going on, Scorch?  You said you don't have  a program director.  Who do you have  to listen to?  We have a boss  that actually fired me  and put me on  with Scorch.  What?  Damn.  Wait, so who's  running the station?  The operations manager.  Ah, you got one of those?  I thought you were, man!  It's like Apocalypse Now  over there.  Our program director  is sitting in the studio  with you, Sam. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, Sam is the program director.  Sam, our intern  is your program director.  He's moved up quite quickly  in the radio industry.  God, we didn't see this talent  when he was working for us.  You had to have  an equal opportunity  to think so we hired  the first black guy  we found.  That was Sam.  He's not quite black, is he?  He's about 1% black,  I'm thinking.  Patrice, you think he's black?  I do.  Our old intern?  No, he's black, right?  Yeah.  He says he's related  to Thomas Jefferson.  This guy's related  to Thomas Jefferson.  So I'm thinking  Thomas Jefferson  had a little thing  with the slave girl.  Diddle the...  Yep, and then 
[01:38:00]  throughout the years  some of that black blood  still shows his face.  He's looking at me like,  how dare you?  Like, nigga hair,  mother...  I'm sorry about that.  You can still say that.  You just can't care.  You had a scale,  didn't you?  1 to 10 on a scale  of blackness.  You gave me a 1.  Yeah, yeah.  He's 1.  He's 1.  He's 1.5,  but he's got that percentage.  That's how it goes.  There's something in there.  We had a black chart  made because of Sam,  Scorch.  Are we still on  with you guys or no?  Yeah.  Because we're not  going to waste  our good stuff  if we're not on  in Syracuse. 
[01:38:30]  This is so we could  get subscriptions  from Syracuse.  That's right.  We're using you  to get more people  to tune in  to the Opie and Anthony  show on XM.  Syracuse is XM  Satellite Radio  Opie and Anthony  on High Voltage  Channel 202.  Wait a minute.  Matt in New York.  Matt, what's up?  Matt.  You motherfucker.  I just switched  forward to the dog  and you're playing  Bon Jovi,  shot through the heart  in a block of commercials.  What the fuck?  Scorch?  Scorch?  Ramon! 
[01:39:00]  Scorch?  What's up?  Are we still on or not?  Not at this point now, no.  No.  Someone said you were  playing...  I'm playing Scorch  in the lion douchebag.  Wait a minute.  We weren't on  and you said we were on?  No, we're on.  He said that we have  a listener that's  calling from Syracuse  that says you were  playing Bon Jovi.  He's on crack.  He just wants to be  an O&A fan.  I'm listening right now.  I hear commercials.  Want me to turn? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, I'm playing commercials  right now.  To believe that,  you'd have to believe  somebody was actually  in Syracuse and listening.  Oh, Sam.  That was Sam,  your intern.  Scorch, so now  we're in commercials?  Now I'm in commercials, yeah.  When did you go  to commercials?  I just hit him.  Right when that guy  said, fuck.  Yeah.  Kevin in New York  says Sam had a black  girlfriend in high school.  Yes, I did.  I had a couple.  I dated a couple  black chicks.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Might as well  keep it in the family.  It's a weird look, though. 
[01:40:00]  It's like he can  pass for white.  Like, he can  pass for white.  It's like a Jewish  thing and a  and the rock thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's something  going on in his  red hair.  He's just a real  He's like 1% black.  But it's the  nappy hair he's got.  My ex-girlfriend's mom  said I was  ethnically  ambiguous.  Yeah, I can't  really figure it out.  Yeah, he could be  Irish, black,  Italian, Jewish,  black, Irish.  No one's mother  is quite comfortable  with his look.  No, Asian. 
[01:40:30]  All right.  Too close.  We're going to have to  say goodbye to Scorch  for now.  All right, Scorchster.  We'll talk to you  again soon.  Always a pleasure.  Thanks, man.  Make a blitz.com.  Totally nude.  Totally nude  with Scorch.  I don't know.  I don't know, Scorch, man,  but it's sad.  It's tough in this  business where, you  know, you can hear  he is a rebel  kind of guy.  And he just can't be.  He's been beaten down.  And he doesn't want to,  like, be a pussy  in front of you guys  when he was sneaking  playing commercial.  And I don't know him  enough to, like,  you know, that's your friend. 
[01:41:00]  No, you got it down.  But just listening to him  and it's just like,  yeah, all right,  fuck that, y'all.  And it's just like  he's playing by Crest.  And it's just like,  he's just trying.  He totally got it.  It's just so sad, man.  We talked to him  out of playing the song.  He was nervous  that he was on  too long talking.  Yeah.  We were able to get  that past him,  but then I think  the nervousness  just got to him.  Oh, I'm going to play  a song.  And it's like,  no, don't play the song.  And I guarantee  he just hit the spots  before that guy  even cursed.  As soon as you get  that slight  I don't want to  burn a bridge  feeling in your life.  I used to be like that 
[01:41:30]  where you just  stomp through  like Godzilla.  And then at some point  you just go  golden handcuffs  and I don't think  it's wrecked.  I feel bad for Scorch, man.  I don't even know the guy.  I'm sorry.  He's a good dude.  We love Scorch, man.  Listen, man,  we want to thank you  for stopping by, too.  Thank you for having me in here.  You want to leave us  with anything mind-blowing?  I think you went through  what you got today, right?  I think I got through  what I brought in here.  I'm trying to think here  if there's anything else  we got.  I'd love to see those.  I like to look around  for household items  and be like,  hey, what can we do 
[01:42:00]  with anything like that?  I'll see him lay a can  over his fingers.  I wonder if I can  have a gray.  Hold on.  I wish he wasn't married.  You could have him  in his soup can or something.  Yeah, I don't think  we have a soup can.  Let me see if I can  give you the old nose grab.  He's writing.  He's writing with a pen  that's in his nose.  It's got to be a...  I've got to get  one of those small felt tips  because you guys  want this back.  I'll just leave that.  Get that out of here.  I got with you.  A little souvenir.  Yeah, we've got  plenty of pens.  You can have that one. 
[01:42:30]  That's great.  You guys can get  some more pens.  You're going to be all right.  So what are we plugging today?  Because we've got to  hit some spots ourselves.  It's all about  Jägermeister and Disturbed  and being down there.  Jägermeister Music Tour.  Yep.  JägermeisterMusicTour.com  and Jäger.com  because we've got  the tour out.  We've got,  you know,  obviously COC and Disturbed  doing the show  and the whole tour,  but Jäger.com as well.  We've got a band program,  almost 200 bands  I believe currently.  They go back and forth  and they really do  do a good job.  They not only take care  of the bands,  bring me out as an MC. 
[01:43:00]  When I'm out on my own,  they're sponsoring me  and hooking me up as well.  So they do get behind  a lot of stuff that,  I mean,  you just got to look at me.  Obviously,  corporate sponsors  are not beating down my door  but Jägermeister takes  good care of me.  I love Jäger.  JägermeisterTour.com  and it's Disturbed  and Corrosion of Conformity  in New York City tonight.  That's right.  And we've got Dope  at the Doki Theater.  We've got Dope  opening up the show.  Dope is opening up the show  for us both nights  here in New York.  Dope's all right, man.  We did some stuff  with them back in the day.  Yeah, they're great.  All right.  Very cool.  And do you have  a personal website?  I do. 
[01:43:30]  TheLizardMan.com  TheLizardMan.com  Try and keep it simple  for people.  Cool.  Thanks, LizardMan.  Cool.  Thanks for having me in, guys.  We have a secret.  We'll tell you the secret next.  Stay there.  You know the soup Nazi  from Seinfeld?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He has a soup place  here in the city.  Just opened up.  And what's the headline?  Soupy Sales.  Yes, Jimmy. 
[01:44:00]  Soupy Soup  dash Y  Soupy Sales.  But that's not enough  for the story.  40-minute wait  as Nazi  does a  bisque business.  Broth brown shirts  couldn't be nicer.  Look at that.  That's cute.  Didn't they slaughter  six million people  a few years ago?  But now it's  soup Nazi.  Now it's just cute. 
[01:44:30]  It's very cute.  Now it's just  a lion waiting for soup.  No dignity for you.  You know,  and then they  take your clothes  and fillings.  Yeah, this whole thing.  Why?  Where is the outrage?  It's just a bunch of people  waiting in line  for the soup Nazi.  Soup Nazi.  Has anyone ever  in one big line?  Seinfeld got away  with everything.  Well, that's not even bad  that he called,  they call him  the soup Nazi.  Because Nazis  become this word  meaning you're a ball buster,  you're an irritant.  But the paper  to do,  here it says  broth brown shirts  couldn't be nicer. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, now that's  really bringing it in  beyond just the term  that Nazi has taken  like Jimmy said.  It could be a ball buster.  It's got some real  fucking Nazi  to work for.  But bringing,  like brown shirts,  that's bringing it in,  you know,  to the traditional term Nazi.  How about people  quote,  showered,  unquote,  with good soup?  Wow.  Christ.  You can't crystal knock  this soup. 
[01:45:30]  Anyway.  And they're trying to keep  the holocaust of it down.  Why?  Is that any different  to what they're doing?  No.  No, it's okay.  That's just it, Jimmy.  What has Ben laughing at?  What are you laughing at? 
[01:46:00]  And we're back  with the Opie and Anthony  program on XM Satellite Radio.  Patrice O'Neill  in studio.  Good afternoon.  What do you think  of Lizard Man?  What is it,  one in the afternoon?  It's one o'clock somewhere.  Oh my God,  I know, right?  God damn.  It's funny,  Lizard Man  was so like  adjusted conversation.  You think you come in  going,  yeah, yeah.  I'm a snake.  But he's like,  yeah, you know,  I cut my face.  Well, that's the point  I was making  because there's other guys 
[01:46:30]  that do this  and the guy  that is living  his life like a cat,  he's a creepy dude.  One of them guys.  Yeah, he's doing this.  When he stretches  in the morning,  it's the Bruce Lee  backstretch.  Yeah, he's taking  a little too seriously.  Remember yesterday  we did the news tease  on the mall Santa?  Yeah.  We got that story,  by the way.  Got the story?  You told the guys  to get it.  We have that.  Now, the tease  was that  the Santa  in the store  and the elves  that helped the Santa  in the department store,  they sent in  an undercover camera 
[01:47:00]  because as they said,  money is more important  than the kids  to these people.  That's right.  And we'll expose  what they're doing tomorrow.  And I was like,  what could they  possibly be doing?  Well, we got it.  We'll go over it  in a second.  We have the answer,  finally.  Yes, but we have a secret.  Calling all pests.  Calling all pests.  We need like a pest signal.  Like the bat signal.  Kind of like the bat signal.  All of a sudden,  we're, you know,  bam.  Don't you have that  bee in the jar sound? 
[01:47:30]  Ugh.  That thing is horrible.  Spray roach.  Just sounds like  a nasty pest.  A fan has some roach spray  on top of the roof.  Let me see.  Yeah.  Get away.  There you go.  There you go.  Anthony's on to something.  When you hear this.  Get away.  We're calling all pests.  Calling all pests.  Get away.  Alert the media.  I'm not a pest.  We have a secret.  Alert the media. 
[01:48:00]  They do everything for us now.  We don't even have to tell them  half the time.  They're defending us  on message boards  we don't even know about  at this point.  Yep.  They just are just  all-knowing.  They're everywhere.  They are.  They're working for the enemy  and the enemy  doesn't even know it.  They are pests.  They're pretty much  everywhere now.  Infiltrators.  Now, if I give out  this secret,  we're expecting  a lot of pests  to get involved  with this secret.  And the secret is  who wants free lunch? 
[01:48:30]  Who wants free lunch?  Who wants free lunch?  Who wants free lunch?  Right.  Who wants free lunch?  That's right, Anthony.  Going to be hungry?  I'm going to be  very hungry Friday.  Friday.  I'm going to be  extremely hungry Friday.  How many of you  pests out there  are hungry  and need a free lunch  on Friday?  Well, we here tell  a nice, warm,  free lunch  of goodness  could be waiting  for you.  Who wants free lunch? 
[01:49:00]  Who wants to wear  their Opie and Anthony  t-shirts under  their bulky coats  and then at the right time  make sure everyone  knows you're there  for free lunch?  Right.  Because there's going  to be a big announcement  tomorrow, boys and girls.  A big announcement  from that prick  Howard Stern.  Who?  He's going to  treat a lot of listeners  to a free lunch  on Friday.  Free lunch on Friday?  Is that what he's doing?  Free lunch on Friday. 
[01:49:30]  Where?  And I think our pests  need to be there  with their Opie and Anthony  t-shirts.  Where?  At the Hard Rock Cafe  in Times Square.  Times Square  Hard Rock Cafe?  That's right.  Free lunch.  Howie's footing the bill.  And he hasn't told  anyone yet.  That's his big announcement?  That's one of his  big announcements  that he's going to  treat everyone  a free lunch.  Pretty much he's going  to rip off Andy Kaufman  and bring his listeners  to lunch.  But he doesn't rip off  anyone, boys and girls.  Everything he does 
[01:50:00]  is original.  Well, that's nice.  Original program.  That's nice.  So if our listeners  want to get something  to eat  and they go down there  and he's doing this  then they get  free eats.  Well, that's good.  Yes, very good idea,  Ben's Raw Ass.  Hold on a second.  Ben's Raw Ass,  one of the pests  checking in right off  the bat here.  What's up, Ben?  Hey, I just wanted to know  how great would it be  to spread the word  to the homeless?  Tippi Tom, 
[01:50:30]  some of the other guys.  You know something?  I think the homeless  and downtrodden  would love a free lunch.  A free, warm lunch.  Can we round up  all the people  that are going to be  in the homeless shopping spree  and send them down there?  Well, they got their own  homeless network.  Yeah.  They just know when  free food is being distributed.  Get the word out  to the homeless.  Homeless, get free meals.  Everyone,  please get the word  out to the homeless.  Do the homeless 
[01:51:00]  have a MySpace?  Ah, they should.  They should.  But good old  Howie's going to be  making this announcement  maybe later today  or tomorrow  that he's giving free lunch  to his listeners  at the Hard Rock Cafe  Friday  anywhere from 10 a.m.  to noon.  Is that an au revoir?  Ugh, half a Hulk face.  Half a Hulk face?  Where's that?  That can't possibly  really be half a Hulk space.  Half a Hulk space.  Half a Hulk face  is MySpace.  Wow, that's really tough to say. 
[01:51:30]  Half a Hulk face  is MySpace.  I'm friends  with half a Hulk face?  He's got me  on the top eight.  Who started  the half a Hulk face  MySpace account?  Oh, all right.  Well, half a Hulk face  has a MySpace account.  How many friends  does he have?  31?  Already?  Oh, my God.  All right, Ben Royce.  Good job there.  Let's say hi to Carl  in New Jersey.  Carl?  Hey, I feel like  that little kid  in the Christmas story  listening on the radio  getting on my 
[01:52:00]  secret decoder ring  and all I got  was a free lunch  or a drink your Oval.  Drink Oval Team.  Yeah, this promotion  should be  should be what  Howie in NYC  is saying over there  on line six, I believe.  I didn't say  it was a huge secret.  It's a secret, though.  And other radio guys  just hate when you  blow their secrets.  They really do.  Howie in New York City.  Hoo-hoo, I invented  the soup kitchen.  Yeah, this should just 
[01:52:30]  turn into a soup kitchen.  All the homeless  just go there  and  Well, the pests  are going nuts.  Alert the media.  FMQB would like to know.  Allaccess.com  would like to know.  RRonline.com  would like to know.  InsideRadio.com  would like to know.  John Minnelli  from the New York Post  would like to know.  David Hinckley  from the New York Daily News  would not like to know  because he's too busy  writing about  some obscure radio story  Right.  that no one gives a shit about.  But everyone else 
[01:53:00]  would definitely  like the news  that Howie's going to  have a surprise announcement  maybe later today  or tomorrow  that he's bringing  his listeners  to the Hard Rock Cafe  for free lunch.  Not only that  the homeless  should go down there  I would think  that if they were  doing something like this  they would want to  promote the product  and be giving out  some free units.  That's right.  So perhaps  some of the homeless  can get their hands  on some of those radios.  That's right.  Mm-hmm.  And we got  Doug out, Doug.  What's going on, guys? 
[01:53:30]  Hey, uh...  One of the bigwigs  in the O&A Army  and a fine pest.  It's also  not a huge secret  that Howard might  get fired on Thursday, too.  Yeah, rumor has it  he's not even going to be able  to do his Friday show.  But if he does get fired  it is pretty much confirmed  that he's going to be  doing his stuff  on Friday anyway.  So we're going to be  doing a wow sticker stop  from the K-Rock studios  to the Sirius studios  on Friday.  Doug,  you might want to listen  closely to this  fine radio program  because I think  we're going to have 
[01:54:00]  more secrets tomorrow.  More secrets about that.  More secrets tomorrow.  But I definitely want  to get out there  to everybody  just to make sure  you behave  and overstress  what you guys  were talking about yesterday  about not getting in trouble  and causing crap.  Just pretend that  you're a Yankee fan  going to a Red Sox game  and just behave.  That's right.  And keep yourselves in line.  And if I can thank  Metro Screen Printing,  NewJerseyScreenPrinting.com,  these guys are doing  all of our signs  and t-shirts  at the cost for us. 
[01:54:30]  These guys absolutely  kick ass out there.  You gotta love it.  So we're going to be  handing out free t-shirts.  Yeah, you guys have  no idea what the Army's  involved with right now.  These tests are just  impossible to deal with.  We've got just about  over 200 people going.  Are they committed though?  Because I read the message boards  and a lot of these guys  come in and then  never show up  and then the next day  they have all these  lame excuses  on the message boards.  My wife,  she had a miscarriage.  I couldn't make it.  That's a lame excuse. 
[01:55:00]  That's a lame excuse.  Kids dead anyway.  Come on, go out.  What else are you going to do?  Sitting at home  stroking her hair  ain't going to help.  It's put up or shut up  time for a lot of the pests.  On my MySpace account,  all I get is a comment  every two minutes.  Reporting for duty,  General, blah, blah, blah, blah,  blah.  We'll show up Friday.  You guys need to get there  on Friday and show your  support for the show.  Do it in a good way.  We have more secrets  on the way, Doug,  but this one is definite.  There's going to be  free lunch at the  Hard Rock Cafe  in Times Square  for all the 
[01:55:30]  Opie and Anthony fans.  Make sure you wear  your Opie and Anthony  t-shirts under your coats.  And grab a bite.  Maybe even change  into your shirts  after you get into  the joint in the bathroom.  Yeah, have them  underneath something.  That's right.  Yeah, that way you get in  without any problems.  And if you don't have a shirt,  we'll have Million Past  March t-shirts.  Did you guys see the designs?  Beautiful.  Yes, they're great.  They're absolutely great.  It's very pretty.  Big-ass member  hooked us up with those.  All right.  Yeah, hopefully we'll see  a lot of guys out there 
[01:56:00]  on Friday.  All right.  Thank you, Doug.  God bless.  All right.  There he goes.  Doug, one of the leaders  of the Army,  and a great pest  for this program.  They went all out.  They got t-shirts  and signs,  and they're all going  to the Hard Rock Cafe  for their free lunch  this Friday.  Free lunch this Friday  at the Hard Rock Cafe  in Times Square  for all of the Anthony fans.  How about that, huh?  Free lunch  for everybody.  Anybody.  That's right.  I got to whisper something, Eric. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, let's see.  I wasn't even a whisper.  It was a point at the screen.  Here we are again, Patrice,  rudderless,  just powering through,  hoping that the guy  that puts his hand  on the tiller  comes back soon.  Oh, there he is.  Look.  Our court,  we're coming back  on course, sir.  Ah, yes.  All right.  We got broke back  mountain audio.  Oh, we got to get 
[01:57:00]  the mall Santa story.  Were you commenting  on four?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I was wondering  about that myself.  Yes, of course I was, Anthony.  Of course.  And you sent Eric  to verify.  All right, something  is wrong with the world.  I got an empty CD case.  Oh, no.  That means there's  a CD around  that Opie doesn't  know where it is  because none of these guys  would have left  an empty CD case,  which means it's missing,  which means Opie  can now concentrate  on nothing  until we find that CD.  This is it.  All right.  Is that it?  All right.  Are you sure, Than? 
[01:57:30]  Yes.  Because if you're not...  All right.  I'm going to trust you  on that one  because we don't have  time to fuck around today.  We got too much radio to do.  All right, the mall Santa story.  We got that.  Yeah.  That announcement, by the way,  that was just announced  by your pals Opie and Anthony  is pissing off  many, many people today.  Please.  Already?  Oh, guaranteed.  Already.  It was supposed to be  a big secret.  It's going to be  a big secret  because they don't like...  They like these things  being like last minute  surprised kind of thing. 
[01:58:00]  Right.  And, um...  If this was the government,  you guys could be...  Oh, yeah.  Killed.  Yeah.  And, you know,  let's remember,  Howard invented everything.  He doesn't rip anyone off,  but he's pretty much  going to do an Andy Kaufman.  Hey, everyone.  Follow me to the Hard Rock  and we'll give you  something to eat.  And maybe he'll be  using a bus.  A double-decker bus,  maybe.  I'm hearing things.  Maybe the double-decker bus  will be filled with, uh...  fans.  Uh-huh.  Fans of this show, 
[01:58:30]  sure.  And maybe some fans  of his show,  I think.  All right.  Mall Santa story, Anthony?  Hopefully people  are still listening.  We kind of teased this.  You saw this on TV yesterday.  Saw the tease  and I couldn't figure out  the payoff.  Usually when you hear the tease,  we're at the point now  where, ah,  we could figure out  the payoff.  This tease  was about Santas  in department stores.  Right.  You know those guys.  You bring the kids.  You sit on a lap.  What do you want for Christmas?  Snap a picture. 
[01:59:00]  And then you're out of there.  That's right.  Well, this one was  money more important  than the kids.  Ooh, what could this be?  And yesterday I speculated  that perhaps  it was some kind of bribery  to get parents' kids  to the front of the line faster.  But Patrice got a good point.  No parent would stand for that  without ratting them out  to management  and getting them fired right away.  I guess the store  was involved in this one.  And now we finally  have an answer.  What was the controversy? 
[01:59:30]  Merry Christmas, everybody.  Merry Christmas.  Ho, ho, ho.  At this time of year,  Jolly St. Nick  is just about everywhere.  Merry Christmas.  So it's hard to imagine  when you look at this  angelic little face  that some of Santa's helpers  Jimmy was there.  Refused to let this little girl  sit on his knee  so her mom  could snap a quick photo  and wait until you hear why.  I was feeling anger.  I was feeling...  I wanted to cry.  Melissa Bassett  is Olivia's mom.  She says she went 
[02:00:00]  to the Rockaway Town Square Mall  in New Jersey  to get a picture  of her daughter's  first visit with Santa.  I had asked the woman there  if I could get  my daughter's picture  taken with Santa Claus  with my own  little disposable camera  because I couldn't afford  the $28 package.  And she had told me  absolutely not.  Either the baby eats  or I got a picture of her.  So I figured the baby  should eat over a picture  of her with Santa Claus.  And you're surprised why.  And the problem is what?  Right.  What happened? 
[02:00:30]  See, apparently  here's their deal  at this store.  You go in.  Your kid sits  on Santa's lap.  They snap a picture.  And you can buy photos  for $28.  You know,  a set probably  you know,  the little wallet size  Oh, they wouldn't let her  take the picture.  No.  No.  Because they're running  a business  which is pictures  with Santa.  This isn't just  a Santa Claus  at a store  where your kid comes up  and what do you want  and sends him away. 
[02:01:00]  This seems to me  like a gig  for the store.  You gotta pay.  You gotta pay.  Santa is a money maker  for the mall.  That would be like  a woman going in  with her kid  to a Sears photo department.  You know those  cheesy Sears photos  and stuff  and you sit down  and sit the kid  on the horse  and the mother going  could you set him up  on the horsey  with the background  but I'll just snap  a picture with my camera.  Right.  No.  This is our business.  We're gonna snap  our fucking picture  and you buy it.  Yeah.  Santa's a hoe.  You don't get that 
[02:01:30]  for free.  Happy holidays.  You don't get  Santa's ass for free.  You gotta pay.  Merry Christmas.  Pay.  When are we gonna realize  that this Christmas thing  is just a crock of shit.  It's so easy.  I'm gonna get by that though.  That's what I'm...  It's like this outrage  that people have.  You go,  oh really Mr. Punk-ass Santa?  Alright sweetie,  do me a favor.  Stay...  I'm gonna hold my kid here  and I'm gonna stand  so Santa's in the background  and I'm gonna get somebody  to take my picture  with...  Fuck his lap.  They want...  It's the first one. 
[02:02:00]  They want their kid  on Santa's lap.  Here's what you do.  You don't ask.  You...  You sit your kid  on the lap.  You have your camera.  Right?  They're taking a picture.  You snap one off  and then you go,  you know,  no,  I don't want any of the pictures.  You're not obligated  to buy the pictures  after they take them.  Right.  It's like any other  photography place.  Right.  That's the move.  You don't ask.  And you don't ask.  You snap your picture.  You go,  take it easy.  What are they gonna do?  Take your camera?  You make a big fuss.  You fall on the floor.  You have a fit.  Go to the fucking Brooklyn mall 
[02:02:30]  and ask that goddamn question  of Santa sitting there  and it's like some black woman  is talking about  he wouldn't let me...  I asked him to let him  take pictures.  He said...  It's just like,  sit down and say cheese,  man.  You're not...  Motherfucker.  Go to that fucking  King's fucking mall.  Hey, in the hood,  is Santa black?  I don't think we've gone that far.  Um...  Nah, Santa's gotta be a white guy.  Yeah, Santa's a white guy  and believe it or not,  um,  as...  Jesus is still white too.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  As much as we want him,  you know,  hair of wool and the thing. 
[02:03:00]  Jesus people...  That's gonna change in a few years.  Hair of wool.  Hair of wool and feet of bronze.  Stop with the hair of wool  and feet of bronze.  He was a fucking towel.  He was an Arab.  He was an Arab.  But the blacks and the whites  want to claim him.  White people want to say  he was fucking the guy  you see in church  and then black people are like,  look and read the Bible.  Hair of wool.  Feet of bronze.  The guy was what you...  He was an Arab.  He looked like Saddam Hussein.  I can't argue with that.  That dude,  he was an...  I mean,  let's face it. 
[02:03:30]  He's closer looking African  than he is,  um,  this rocker  that white people want to make.  It's like saying  an Asian guy.  Yeah,  he's like a heavy metal guy.  It's heavy metal.  This Chris Robinson looking dude  that we got up there in shirts.  But Santa's not...  Santa's definitely not black.  In the hood,  nah.  Santa's a fat old,  like,  biker.  We got more audio,  by the way.  This mom should just get  the uncle to dress up like Santa  and get the picture done that way.  Yeah,  take some initiative there,  mom. 
[02:04:00]  Here we go.  More on the Santa mall story.  So was this an isolated incident  or are there other needy families  that are being turned away?  Well,  we went undercover  to find out.  Our Fox 5 producer  had some little helpers  for this one,  including a little boy named Matt  and a little girl named Liana.  First stop,  Rockaway Town Square Mall,  the same place  that turned away  little Olivia.  So in order to see Santa,  you have to get the pictures?  No,  she can go and say,  visits are always welcome,  she can go and say hello, 
[02:04:30]  but if you do a personal picture,  you have to buy ours.  How much are the pictures?  Anywhere from $21.99  to $24.99 plus.  So if you don't have the dough,  once again,  it was ho-ho,  no photo.  Oh,  ho-ho,  ho-ho,  ho-ho,  no photo.  Oh,  this is why I hate the news,  by the way.  This poor girl  that's working in the Santa booth,  she's just...  It's like,  look, lady,  I'm not fucking...  You hear the fake mom? 
[02:05:00]  How much for the pictures?  Yeah.  How much for the pictures?  Look,  I didn't make the price.  Really, man?  You know what I'm making here?  Yeah.  I make fucking $5.50 an hour.  This is a second job  so I can get presents for my kids.  Yeah.  Leave me alone.  Could you take your fox  to hidden cameras?  Crap.  And maybe find something that...  The fake hat and glasses  and go somewhere else  with your stupid undercover camera?  The huge glasses  with a big camera in the middle,  a big Cyclops camera.  But it's gotta be...  There's some people who... 
[02:05:30]  Like that...  It's like some...  You should always...  You should train your workers  to be apologetic  anytime they say dumb shit  like $25.99.  Like how much of these?  They should always have  a professional way of going...  Oh, it's $25.  I know.  It is.  Right, right.  They're hunks of shit.  It's Christmas.  I don't have anything to do.  But she's like $25.99.  $26.  It's just...  She's so happy  to be an asshole.  It's like...  Teach them how to be  apologetic a little bit.  But it is business. 
[02:06:00]  It's business, unfortunately.  You're in a mall.  I mean, they're not gonna give you  shit for free in a mall.  You know how many Santas  there are around  that you could just go  and take your kid  and pop on the lap  and snap a picture?  Right.  This is a couple of stores  that are using it  as a business.  Maybe it's very nice.  Maybe they have  a very nice background.  Who knows?  I'm sure there's free Santas  all over your towns and stuff.  Maybe the local fire department.  I'm sure they're doing it  for free somewhere.  Maybe passing a hat around  for charity.  But in a mall, 
[02:06:30]  this is what you gotta expect.  I'm sorry.  If I was treating people  like shit,  like if I owned a company  and I was treating people  like the customers  like shit  by making them buy something  for a ridiculous amount  of money  on a special holiday,  I would let my employees  say that I'm an asshole.  Pass the buck, yeah.  It's a fucking company.  Let me tell you.  They're an asshole.  Just a fucking god.  Can you believe...  I would train them  to be able to just...  Yeah.  Here's a picture of it.  Just lay it on us.  He's a...  Oh, I hate him.  But it's nothing I can do.  I can get fired. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  I wouldn't buy it either.  But it's the only thing.  They want a picture  with Santa.  They can join it.  It's like you can't...  Like, rent a car.  How much money?  95 hours a day?  Right.  Mr. Hurts is a dick.  All right, listen.  We got more audio here.  It's Christmas time.  I mean, is there any contingency plan  for families who can't afford it?  I have to call our company.  I'm only a set manager here.  I follow the rules of my company.  Should Santa be free?  I have an answer for this, okay?  Santa takes a lot of pictures 
[02:07:30]  out in the mall  for the families outside the set.  And that's it.  So there are many families  who ask me,  and I say yes,  and I step outside  and I take a photo.  So that's it?  Yes.  So that entire premise here  was erroneous.  I take a photo  with the families.  I do know the one you're speaking  of this morning,  and we told her  that Santa would be glad  to step outside  and have her picture taken.  Only Santa's helpers  never offered to do that  on our undercover video.  And Melissa says  she was flat out turned away.  They had, you know,  they never offered  any other package. 
[02:08:00]  They didn't say that  Santa would go  to any other part of the mall.  What is Melissa doing  in a mall  if she can't feed her kids?  Yeah, 28 bucks  to feed your kid.  Right.  Get out of the mall.  Get out of the mall.  Perhaps you shouldn't  be in there.  Oh, I hate these  undercover cops.  I really do.  I hate everyone involved  in this story.  Yeah, I don't know.  I hate the store.  I hate the Santa.  I hate the pictures  that cost the 28 bucks.  And I hate the mom.  I hate little Olivia.  I hate the two fake 
[02:08:30]  fucking kids  from the story.  They all stink.  No one's redeeming in this.  No one.  I'm trying to like,  this is a tragic story.  Wait a minute.  No, wait a minute.  Santa was cool.  Santa was like,  man, I go outside  and I take with some family.  I go outside the set.  Santa was cool.  Santa was a cool guy.  That shit's erroneous,  motherfucker.  And after he said  erroneous,  come on now,  you know.  Santa's getting a kickback  too, man.  That guy's just trying  to make a few extra bucks.  Yeah, that guy's  got to get paid.  He's lucky enough  to look like Santa.  The rest of the year  he looks like shit.  This is his time to shine.  Let him take a few bucks. 
[02:09:00]  Erroneous?  This story was erroneous.  Erroneous.  We got a statement  from Santa Management.  Our request is that  anyone who would like  to take a photo  themselves,  that they purchase  one of our packages.  And that's the way  we stay in business.  Oh, that was a  high and hearty  fuck you  is what that was.  All right, now I hate  Santa and them all.  I hate them all.  I'll tell you why.  I hate that fucking manager.  Because they figured out  how to make this  into a business.  And I guarantee  back in the day, 
[02:09:30]  if we go through  our little family  photo albums  and you see us  as tiny little tots  on Santa's lap,  I bet you our parents  did not pay for that picture.  Not a dime, Opie.  Not a dime.  But someone along the way  said,  oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I got something here.  And now it's big business.  Imagine the guy  in charge of the whole thing  is standing back.  He's watching kid after kid  get up on Santa's lap  and the parents  snapping pictures.  And then it just hits him  and he starts saying,  a cha-ching.  Another kid,  cha-ching.  We can make some money here. 
[02:10:00]  Santa got a MySpace.  We'll call where he's sitting  the set.  The set.  We'll call it the set.  Right.  And then if they want  pictures on set,  now it's going to  cost some money.  Right.  Makes it sound more professional.  Wait, someone's  guts.  I hate the store.  I hate Santa now.  I hate everything.  Santa stinks.  Santa's ripping people off.  The mother that brought  the kid is a cheap fuck.  That's right.  28 bucks to feed.  What are you feeding that kid?  Let's go to Jerry in Jersey.  Gold Leaf.  Jerry. 
[02:10:30]  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  What's happening?  Like I was going to say,  you go to the mall,  go to the restaurant,  say, hey, listen,  I don't have to have money  for the dinner,  but if I can just go  in the kitchen  and make myself a sandwich,  if you don't mind,  let me in,  I can make a sandwich.  That's all.  There you go.  It's business.  But you would have to bring  your own sandwich things,  but you would be using  their utensils and everything.  Yeah, it's business.  So you've got to keep  the analogy correct.  That was a bad analogy, man.  No, I think he's got a point.  Let's say you bring  your own ham, 
[02:11:00]  you've got some Swiss,  and you've got a hero,  but you need a knife  and some mustard  or something,  and you go into their kitchen  and you need a plate  and a place to sit and eat it.  That's a whole different service.  Now I hate the fucking restaurant.  I hate the person  that doesn't let me eat there.  He's a symbol.  You know, that's like,  it's the symbol.  I know.  He's a symbol.  He's a black man  trying to get a white woman.  No, that's Toogie Williams,  but they wouldn't even let him  climb the Empire State Building. 
[02:11:30]  Toogie.  Toogie gone.  Toogie.  Toogie, what up, Toogie?  That's why.  You know something?  I'm tipping my club soda.  To Toogie.  Pour one out, Toogie.  You better not play.  Pour for Toogie.  I'll play it around.  I'll just pour some out.  Fucking poke,  hand-handle 18 cribs  up in this motherfucker.  We're not playing.  Arnold Schwarzenegger  should watch his ass now.  One of the bloods.  All right.  All right, here we go.  We have one more piece of audio 
[02:12:00]  from this story.  Thank God.  Let's see who we hate  at the end of this clip.  After her mom complained  to the Rockaway Town Square  management,  they did the right thing.  We had her picture taken.  Compliments of them all.  Rockaway Town.  Just hers.  Now I hate them all.  Even more now.  Now, here's my order of hatred.  I have an order of hatred.  Mall, number one, hated.  Yeah.  Mom, hated.  Hated.  Little Olivia, hated.  Santa, hated. 
[02:12:30]  Santa's helpers, hated.  Nah, I think the mom  is the most hated.  Mom most hated?  Oh, this do-gooder.  The mall giving in  made me hate them more.  They had to.  They should know they  didn't have to.  It was going to be bad  for business.  Fuck it.  It was going to be bad  for business.  They would be exploited  for being a business.  They don't want people  to know that.  They want people to think  they're doing a good thing here.  Who saw the piece?  Visually.  Danny.  Danny?  Was the kid cute?  Nah.  Or was it some ugly-ass  fucking kid? 
[02:13:00]  Because if it was an ugly kid,  then it's even worse.  Hold on.  I guarantee the mom  was just a mess.  Just a mess.  What did the mom look like?  Well, the kid was cute.  The kid was cute?  There you go.  Was little Olivia cute?  Yeah, she was a darling  little girl,  but the mother was just  fat-like.  Fucking mess.  Beaner-looking kids.  Yeah, actually, you're right.  You're absolutely right.  She was just huge,  just huge, overgrown,  just gigantic mess,  but the kid was, you know,  a little cute girl.  I'm sure her marriage  is just wonderful. 
[02:13:30]  All right.  Well, here's the rest  of that clip.  After her mom complained  to the Rockaway Town Square  management,  they did the right thing.  We had her picture taken,  compliments of the mall.  Rockaway Town Square mall.  Management paid for it.  But she says it's a picture  she'll be forced to look at  with bittersweet memories  of her daughter's  first Christmas.  It's going to remind me of,  it comes down to the money.  It doesn't come down  to the holiday.  It doesn't come down  to the happiness.  It comes down  to the almighty dollar now.  Then why'd you get  the picture taken? 
[02:14:00]  Then why?  This would be a bittersweet memory.  It's a constant reminder.  Mom hate the most now.  Yeah.  Yes.  Mom now is most hated.  Mom.  Then the store.  Then little Olivia.  Then Santa.  Then the Santa's helper.  The crying baby?  Crying fucking baby.  Okay.  No.  Mom and then Olivia.  And then the store.  Because that kid crying  puts me off.  Wait, the kid's a baby?  The kid's not even  remember this shit?  Oh, yeah.  I thought that might be  another kid you had.  This was like the baby's 
[02:14:30]  first Christmas or whatever.  How old was the baby?  I couldn't have been  more than a year old.  Yeah, Brian.  Fiery crabs on the way home.  The kid was just baked?  What a bit of justice.  I guess, yeah.  A just baked kid?  Yeah.  I hate the phony-ass,  pussy-ass mall.  Yeah.  The pussy-ass.  See, this is who y'all  should be mad at the most.  This is the thing that  makes people get fired  when they do dumb shit.  Is that there's a nervousness  floating around this world,  right? 
[02:15:00]  With a mall,  just, okay, oh shit,  pressure from this goofy  bitch in the news.  Just tell her.  If they had stood up  and said, look,  this is how it is,  I'm going to make the bitch  pay $29.95,  and that's it.  So you can be it  because the publicity  of the news down here  is going to make other people  come down here  and take the picture.  Here we go.  I got a secret.  All right.  Free pictures  down at that mall  with Santa.  If you're a mom,  go down there  and just bitch about it.  And just complain.  And then she set a precedent. 
[02:15:30]  Now you go down there  and say, well,  that woman did it.  Yep.  I want my free picture too.  Dumbass Ma hate that.  All right.  We got some hate  on the instant feedback.  Bob from Kentucky.  What bitch gets her picture  for free  and still fucking  goes to the media?  Good point.  Yeah.  Complaining.  She's probably  gearing up for a lawsuit.  Nah, she went after.  She complained  that the media  got her the free pictures.  And someone is suggesting  that this bitch  is going to sue  for having her  Christmas ruined.  Yeah, she got her  free pictures  after the media  stepped in. 
[02:16:00]  Because they just told her  to go fuck herself.  Get out of here, bitch.  And that's when  the store was  on my like list.  When they told her  they gave in.  Why?  When they gave in  with that bullshit.  We are going to  give her a free  compliments of  and she's getting  a gift certificate  and we're going to  give lunch  to her and  little Olivia.  Anthony, by the way,  you got to pour one out  for Richard Pryor too.  A lot of people  need some feedback.  Oh, right.  Shit, man.  That's right.  And McCarthy.  Eric Oz and, yeah.  And I loved  the little piece 
[02:16:30]  that Entertainment  Tonight did last night.  What'd they do?  Oh, they were talking  to Richard Pryor's wife.  Oh, the wife.  I saw the daughter.  The wife was on  Entertainment Tonight  literally an hour or two  after he passed.  They didn't really care.  Big fucking interview  from the room  he died in, basically.  Or the room  he spent  the last couple years  in his life.  He died falling  off a mountain  as he was climbing it.  You know what I mean?  It's not like he was  driving a Grand Prix car  and hit the wall.  You know? 
[02:17:00]  The guy,  how long have they  been looking at  Richard Pryor going,  tick tock.  Yeah.  This just,  this is coming.  It was a tough one.  Not a big surprise.  What about McCarthy, though?  What happened?  Is he dead?  Yeah, he died  the same day,  Richard Pryor.  He couldn't follow Rich.  Wow.  Wait, who?  Senator McCarthy.  Oh, okay.  Yo, white guys,  you should know.  I don't know.  I thought he was  dead already.  Only reason I know  is because it interrupted  Richard Pryor news 
[02:17:30]  for a second.  Yeah.  Well, let's go  to these phones.  Dante from Jersey.  Dante.  Not even supposed  to be here today.  Listen, you know,  this whole Santa  mall thing  is just a goddamn  scam.  I mean, they get you  for like $28  for the picture.  Then they get you  for like another  $15 for the frame.  And then, of course,  you got to get  the digital pictures  on this little  three and a half  floppy.  By the time you're done,  it's like $60, $70. 
[02:18:00]  It's just business,  unfortunately.  Fucking faggot, Dante.  Christmas is just  big business.  It has nothing to do  with religion anymore.  And he's from Jersey.  The lady's a twat, too.  I mean, Jesus Christ.  You can't afford, you know,  don't fucking bring  your kid to the mall.  That's why it amazes me  that they want to call  it the holiday tree  and happy holidays.  Christmas means  big business.  That's all it means  at this point.  It has nothing to do  with religion.  It's all about shopping.  And, Opie,  we usually have  this conversation.  What are you doing 
[02:18:30]  about shopping?  You know  we are  in the same boat here.  We don't like  going shopping.  Christmas shopping.  We're lucky that  we have weird hours,  so I've been hitting  the stores after the show  a little bit.  Oh, you've actually  been doing shopping?  I've got to shop this year.  I've got to do a little shopping.  For who?  Everyone?  For the girl and  Well, that goes without saying.  For my mom and  maybe some nephews and nieces.  That's about it.  What about brothers?  What do you do?  Ah, fuck them.  What do you do with the brothers?  Just  Nothing?  Nah. 
[02:19:00]  Merry Christmas.  I have turned  into a gift certificate guy.  Yeah.  But not even gift certificate.  I hand out  those American Express cards  that have money on them.  Here you go.  Here you go.  That's cool, though.  Shuffle them out.  I love the gift certificate  as a gift.  Because everyone gets it.  Because then you go and buy  what you want.  I'm so sick of opening things.  I'm like,  ugh, this thing.  Now you get what you want.  The pressure of making believe  you wanted the gift  that you just opened up.  Right.  And people go,  oh, you're not thankful. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, I'm not.  There's no thought to it.  It's just an awkward situation.  You feel stressed.  Like, oh, God,  this person that I've been hanging with  has no clue what I like.  Yeah.  That's great.  My mom doesn't know  that I don't want  dumb sweaters anymore, you know?  So then what do you do?  Before you make any real money in life,  you've got to drag the stuff back  to the mall,  wait in line  to just get, you know,  get something you like.  I just wore it.  I hate Christmas.  Like any clothes  that people have gotten me  over the years for Christmas, 
[02:20:00]  I just wore.  I didn't care.  You just wore it?  I just wore it.  I didn't care.  But now, you know,  that I'm some kind of  a fashion statement,  I don't wear them anymore.  Yeah.  They get it for me.  It's like maybe  lounging around the house stuff.  I'm so,  I'm so I want what I want  that just don't get me shit.  You know, my past,  my birthday just passed.  My girl's trying to,  you know,  she got me a fucking teddy bear  that sings happy birthday.  Thanks, Puddin' Pop. 
[02:20:30]  Get that shit out of here  if I shove it up your ass.  But she's trying her best  because she doesn't have  get me something nice money  while the bitches buy diamonds.  I got her during the off season,  not even during her birthday,  during the fucking,  so she's like,  get me this.  And you know,  I got fish.  And so she went out  and bought a,  you know,  took a chance  on buying a fish.  Yeah.  And I got,  we're just going to  just fuck up your tank now.  Well, exactly.  Because it's,  and I had,  because I got cichlids,  you know,  cichlids are like,  they like to step down 
[02:21:00]  from like piranhas  or whatever.  You want dangerous fish,  but they're also  good looking fish  or whatever.  So you cannot put  the same kind in there.  So I got one in there.  She bought it.  She's like,  you got to open it now.  It was a day before my birthday.  I go,  what?  What is it?  I pull it,  it's a bag,  it's a fish.  And it's the most  not can't put the  motherfucker in my tank fish.  Please tell me  you had to put it in.  I did.  Right in front of her eyes.  Absolutely.  I go,  sweetie,  booby,  booboo.  And the bear sings,  happy birthday,  happy birthday.  And I'm looking at 
[02:21:30]  the fucking fish  and I'm looking at  happy birthday  and I have to go  put it and pop.  She had that  disappointing look  and I'm like,  and she,  you know,  it costs probably 69.95  and she scraped  and whatever.  And I'm like,  get this shit  out of my face.  But in a,  oh,  coochie cooey,  boo,  boo,  boo.  This is,  baby,  you can't put this  big ass fish  in my tank.  There's a,  there's an ecosystem  happening in this  motherfucker.  Yo,  fuck up the ecosystem. 
[02:22:00]  Your fish is going to  give all my fish  pink eye.  Take your shitty fish  and take it back to this.  Dropping some tigers  into the antelope pen.  She got the most,  if I had to chew,  if you had to,  if you asked me,  what wouldn't you do  right now?  I wouldn't put  one of these in,  wouldn't want,  she bought me  one of these.  And a fucking bear  that sings happy birthday.  I wanted to knock  this bitch's head.  And how does it sing  happy birthday?  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  The fish must have been  a white fish. 
[02:22:30]  And I got African sickling.  She bought a New Guinea  hunky fish.  You can't put a white fish  in my tank.  The New Zealand cracker fish.  I'm like,  sweetie,  you just can't put it in here.  She bought something  called the Virginia  plantation owner.  I'm going to put this in here.  What's all you wet niggas  doing in here?  This reminds me  of New Orleans  in this tank.  What, 
[02:23:00]  motherfucker?  Why I could have you  shot for that,  sir?  And it's like,  you know how your girl,  she just doesn't have  enough money  to buy me anything  I give a shit about.  Sweetie,  what do you want?  I want rims,  new rims for my truck.  Yeah.  You can't get them.  So just give me a kiss  and say happy birthday.  I don't really,  you know what I mean?  That's really funny.  I usually get,  as far as what I'm interested in,  and toys and stuff like that,  the second it hits my head,  I buy it.  I've kind of, 
[02:23:30]  and I don't want to sound like,  you know,  I just buy whatever I want.  I worked like a motherfucker  my whole life.  Believe me,  I know what it's like  to actually look in a magazine  at a picture of something,  in a car  or a toy  or a computer  and go,  motherfucking,  just imagine what it would be like  to have that.  I went through years of that shit  and through luck  and work  and the way things have worked out,  I've reached a point in my life,  and I'm no kid,  where I've reached a point 
[02:24:00]  where I can  indulge in some of these  pleasures in life.  I do the same thing now.  So when people ask me,  what do I want for Christmas?  If it pops in my fucking head,  I will buy it.  Immediately.  I cannot get online quickly enough  to buy what I want.  You know the Warriors  Xbox game?  Right.  The Warriors.  That's great.  Immediately when it came out,  I bought it.  You bought it.  So she goes,  surprise!  I go,  bitch,  there's nothing you can do for me.  I haven't. 
[02:24:30]  I'm already on level 17.  Stop trying to be...  That's why I love my mother.  She's such...  She's the same awful human being I am.  My mother went to Atlantic City  for Thanksgiving.  Gosh,  there's no more mommy stuff.  You know what I mean?  No.  All we do now  is that we're at that  uncomfortable I love you stage.  We never said love you.  Now it's like,  you know...  That's nice.  At the end of the phone call,  it's like,  you know,  we flip a coin.  I love you or love you.  No,  here it is.  This is it.  All right, 
[02:25:00]  mom's got to go.  And then a silence of...  A silent coin flipper.  Who says love you first?  Oh.  All right.  Love you.  Oh.  Love you too.  Wow.  So that's me and my mom.  But we love each other.  It's implied love.  Right.  It's,  you know...  And my mother will take money.  You know,  my mother will take $1,000  to go gamble.  She's not one of these...  I don't...  If I was a drug dealer,  my mother would accept the money.  She'd say,  I don't want your evil drug money.  And she'd be like,  thank you, baby.  Put it right in her bra.  And spend that fucking money. 
[02:25:30]  Not like Scarface's mother  when he went home.  There you go.  You're a dumb fucking...  Your son's a rich drug dealer.  You'll get killed anyway.  Yeah.  Take your money.  Doesn't matter.  Take the fucking money,  you dummy.  Don't want your money around here.  It's terrible.  My mother will take drug money  and that's why I like her.  And that...  Women don't understand.  We're not sensitive.  Don't get a shit that,  you know...  I told my ex-girl,  don't get me...  Ever get me a card.  Ever again.  No, you don't like the cards?  And the thing is,  women,  they go zero to 60. 
[02:26:00]  If you go,  sweetie,  don't fuck...  You talk too much.  They don't...  They won't talk to you.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  So she took offense to that  so she gets me...  She got me nothing  after I go,  hey, don't...  Baby, I'm telling you,  these cards mean nothing to me.  They make me sick.  Oh my God.  You don't like the cards,  though?  Don't get me a fucking card.  I kind of like the cards.  Nothing.  From certain people.  Like, I think boyfriend,  girlfriend cards are great.  I like them.  I don't like... 
[02:26:30]  I don't like the idea of,  you know,  just the plagiarism part of it  where, you know,  Hallmark wrote this  and, you know,  here it is.  It said what I feel.  But you're right.  You're right,  the little cutesy thing  at the end of it.  What about the little kids  on the front  and they're in love  and they're like four  walking down a path  or something.  The kid's got  wearing a dad's hat  and shoes  and he's holding a rose.  And then you're like,  look, that one looks  just like you  and that one looks  just like me.  There we go.  That's great.  That's how women love.  That's their love. 
[02:27:00]  Holding hands  and coochie-cooing  and cards.  That's stuff  weep for them.  Fucking ebony section  of the cards.  The ebony Hallmark section.  I have been buying  my mother those cards  for years.  For Christmas,  and stuff.  I didn't even know  they had an ebony Hallmark.  And it's like,  to my mama.  And it's some black eye  on the front and stuff.  And I'll buy one of those  for my mother.  And it just cracks up  the family.  They're all a bunch  of racist Italians  so they laugh  their asses off  at my grandmother's house.  Look, you got one  of the colored cards. 
[02:27:30]  And what do they put  in the space  where the Father's Day  cards are supposed to be?  Oh, Jesus.  Cocksucker.  That's kind of good.  You've got to get me  one today.  But I'll tell you something.  Fucking empty rack.  There's nothing there.  Need a Father's Day card.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  God damn,  I've got to go get  a white one.  You know what I'm  really loving?  This is something  terrible.  This is something  my girlfriend got.  And it's a great thing, 
[02:28:00]  and I love it.  A paper shredder.  Do you know  I have a shredder  next to my desk?  You are a paranoid  motherfucker.  I can't get enough  of using this shredder.  Isn't that a great thing?  I look for things  to shred.  Isn't that a great paper?  Don't you love  shredding paper?  When that's...  And you look at it,  it comes out like confetti.  It feels so government.  There ain't no motherfucker  putting that together.  I shred my name.  Anything with my name  and address on it.  Everything gets...  Yeah.  I'm shredding like  flyers that come in. 
[02:28:30]  Hey, Great Neck,  join us for a community tier.  Mmm.  I'm shredding...  And now I've learned  the pleasure of  shredding Christmas cards.  Because I'll get cards  from people  I don't give a shit.  I say my mommy.  I'll put that up,  you know,  by the TV or something.  And my girlfriend.  Mm-hmm.  Her cards I save.  Anyone else?  It's like,  uh,  to a great nephew  marry happy holl...  Nah.  Here's one  from, 
[02:29:00]  oh,  Bank of America,  a valued customer  or a weak...  There it is.  It is a great day  shredding, man.  And you can't even  tell what it is.  And I don't know  what it is,  but it's fun to use.  You must shred.  You have to shred.  Get yourself a shredder.  You won't regret it.  I'm too busy  having garage sales.  That's my latest thing.  And don't you feel  better when you...  I absolutely love it.  I'm just throwing shit  on the sidewalk  outside my apartment  here in New York City  and watching how long  it takes before  someone grabs my shit.  Oh, you don't sell it.  You just put it out there.  Fuck no, man.  It started with old clothes.  It's fantastic. 
[02:29:30]  And like old CDs and stuff.  I'm so obsessed  with this new thing  that I'm just starting...  I'm starting to throw  things out there  that I still want.  Just to see.  But just to see.  We peek through the blinds  and see how long  it takes to, you know...  I've thrown my old  underwear out there.  Just the dumbest shit  to see if people  will take it.  And so far,  I have not found  one thing that a person...  They won't take.  That they won't take.  It's genius.  It's genius to do that.  I have to admit it.  I had a blanket that...  The shit on this... 
[02:30:00]  Sing happy birthday.  I had a blanket  with all sorts of stains.  Stains that I don't  even want to describe.  Just ridiculous, man.  Looked like a goddamn painting.  And I threw that out there  all spread out nice.  That thing lasted 30 seconds.  Oh, homeless, man.  That's...  And it was a white  type of comforter  with like a flower pattern  on it.  And the shit on this thing,  I'm like,  I don't even know what it is.  You probably have...  Your garbage...  Like, I have things...  I have really nice garbage.  You know,  when you get that lonely  I have to buy something 
[02:30:30]  kind of thing going on.  I've thrown out  nice comforters, man.  Even if it got some stains  on it or something,  it's just a nice...  You know,  people know nice  and they go,  somebody threw this away?  I don't...  I'm gonna wash this shit.  This is nice.  Yeah.  I forgot to tell you,  bitch brought me flowers, too.  I forgot to tell you.  Flowers?  Flowers, yeah.  Yeah, we don't do flowers.  Yeah, she brought me flowers  and I used to work  at a flower stand  when I was younger  so I know about flowers  and it...  Open roses, bad.  Right.  So when she brought them for me  they were all open.  That means  eight seconds 
[02:31:00]  they're gonna die.  But I still gotta go...  Closed up, yeah.  I can't go,  booby, booby,  dumb bitch,  you brought me dead flowers!  So it's like...  You got those flowers  on the side of the road somewhere.  Booby, booby!  It's like  any time,  any guys out there  buying your girl flowers,  buy it,  squeeze the bulb  and if it's hard  and close,  good roses.  Don't buy open roses.  They're gonna open up nice.  Oh, yeah.  They'll last.  Yeah, I'm just...  Yeah.  Let's say hi to BCH.  BCH,  what does your name stand for?  It's Bert Convy here 
[02:31:30]  from White Bag.  Oh, what's up?  Hey, man.  Oh, Bert Convy here.  Very good.  What do you think  it's gonna cost more,  the fucking tattoos  on Lizard Man  or the fucking therapy  to make Patrice normal again?  We need an insurance man  to evaluate that.  I don't know.  He's just like...  Listen to me.  His relationship,  it's beyond me.  Like, we spoke about it  at the Halloween party  for a while.  But he's trying.  But you're standing there  and I'm like,  I don't understand  how you're in  this relationship.  Like, I don't understand 
[02:32:00]  the whole relationship.  He's moving back  to reality, though,  because that time  you came in  with the glass dildos,  remember what I said to you?  I'm like,  are you going crazy  in front of our eyes?  Yeah.  And you're not  that same person.  You're now getting back  into kind of living  in reality.  No, I still...  I just...  No, I didn't carry  the fucking suitcase around  like, get smart.  It's just...  I brought it here,  but it's still at the house.  But what I saw...  Tackling women  and shoving something  up their head.  What I saw in that suitcase  was deeply disturbing, though.  It's still there,  but it's more...  I can see you having  a glass dildo 
[02:32:30]  around the house, sure.  You had dozens of them.  And I still have dozens.  I have my...  Look it.  If somebody came...  If the cops came in  during a fuck session  that I was having,  somebody would get arrested.  Even if my girl was going,  no, no, I want this.  It's like...  We don't care.  Man, no.  He has to be raping you.  You obviously don't understand  what's going on here.  I have a fucking...  I have a...  It's just...  It's release.  I'm getting older.  I take medicine.  And it's things like...  I only got enough energy  to let one out. 
[02:33:00]  You know what I mean?  I can't pump all day.  She's older,  meaning she's in her 30s.  And her sex drive is...  She's enormously horny all the time.  And I can't satisfy  just fucking all the time.  It's not going to happen.  You know what I'm saying?  So you need the goddamn toys  to do your thing.  But we have a normal relation  because she's a hoe.  You know, she's a reformed hoe.  And I got to let...  She's always had abusive boyfriends  that said,  Bitch, don't be a hoe!  You know, I cultivate her wholeness.  I let her be a hoe. 
[02:33:30]  She pulled the titties out  at the thing.  That made her feel so liberated.  So I don't beat her down.  And she gets to be free and be whole.  Now she's learning how to care  and she's not too sure how to do it.  You know, buying me goofy shit.  I buy her nice diamonds  and nice...  My love is selfish.  It's just like,  I want to keep this...  You know, she's trying to put on a little weight  sometimes.  You know, face breaks out  and I don't want to say,  Look, sweetie, I am not...  Holy shit.  I tell her, you are eye candy 
[02:34:00]  and I am not, like,  in love with you on the level  of letting you get fat.  You understand?  Don't get fat.  Don't get bad skin.  It's important.  I'm not...  I'm not...  What do you call it?  I'm not that grounded.  I'm not that mature.  So you're pretty much telling her,  if you get fat...  Why would I be with you fat  when I'll be with a better fat bitch?  Like, you...  You're not going to make a good fat bitch, 
[02:34:30]  so I'm telling you right now.  Wow.  You're a sexy hoe.  Why would you try to become a fat bitch  when you've always been a sexy hoe?  You're not comfortable being a fat bitch.  I've got to go with a fat bitch.  If I'm going to be with a fat bitch,  I'll go there  because there's better fat bitches  who will live to be fat bitches  Let me tell you something.  They understand how to be one.  Brilliant.  Wow.  I say brilliant.  I'm not even kidding.  Brilliant.  There's women out there  that know how to be the fat bitch,  and you're saying this one is the hoe  and not the fat bitch. 
[02:35:00]  But now you say you notice or put on weight.  Do you say something to her?  I don't jump.  She knows I'll be the...  She knows I like a big woman.  She's trying to stay...  She's a sexy hoe.  She's not anything other than that.  If she starts to grow,  it's not good.  She has to look good.  But you know what it is?  She's a hoe who's experiencing love.  Now, she's in love.  So love makes her feel a little...  She can let her guard down. 
[02:35:30]  She thinks she can eat.  Yeah.  She thinks she doesn't...  She thinks she can eat.  She thinks she doesn't...  I love her for who she is.  It's like I do,  but bitch,  who you are is a fine bitch.  Not a fat bitch?  Yeah.  I'll go get a better fat bitch.  There's fat bitches out there  that just carry fat bitch well.  Yeah.  They know how to be a fat bitch.  She does not.  And so I'm...  You know,  she knows.  She fucking knows.  Words of wisdom, Patrice.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  We should stop right there 
[02:36:00]  so we can take our links and stuff.  I'm amazed by you.  Hey, we got to talk about Bad Santa.  Front page of the New York Post.  This guy is a classic.  This guy rocks.  A little bit of trouble.  A little bit of trouble.  And yeah,  the city's up in arms  over this guy  and his Santa display.  Oh, when aren't they?  All right.  We'll continue.  Oh, I'm going to play  something from here, Derek.  We'll play this  and we'll continue.  No?  I didn't have it loaded?  Great.  Oh.  That's smart.  You hit the button  and the CD and case  is still in your hand. 
[02:36:30]  Come on.  Here we go.  Two guys getting kicked  hard  right in the crotch  with no protection.  Oh!  That got him.  Oh, that got him.  If he wasn't chained up,  he would have fallen down.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  This is not right!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  That's it!  That's got him out there! 
[02:37:00]  That's got to be it!  That's got to be it!  Oh, my God!  All right.  Let's see if we can't  get a good kick in  from Grandma.  Grandma is lining up.  Oh!  He's down!  He's down!  He's down!  You don't turn Grandma  like that!  Come on!  She got the bullseye.  Grandma still got a chance,  right?  Let's hear it for Grandma!  Grandma, put him down!  I hope he really doesn't 
[02:37:30]  care about our lives.  And I hate you all.  Oh!  And I hate you all.  Oh!  And I hate you all.  Oh!  And I hate you all.  Oh!  Ah!  You've got to have me!  Look, Jerky,  I don't need to talk to you.  All right, kids,  hold on your hats.  One, two, three.  Oh!  Oh!  I hate you all.  Oh!  Oh!  I hate you all.  Ah! 
[02:38:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  The... ノia!  the...  ...  ...  It's our show, you tool. 
[02:38:30]  I knew this was a scam.  I knew this was a scam.  Unbelievable.  I can't go on.  Opie and Anthony.  Come on, it's not funny anymore.  You can stop.  You can stop. 
[02:39:00]  All right, this is the Opie and Anthony program.  We have Disturbed on the way.  They're stopping by to say hi.  They're playing the Nokia Theater tonight in New York City.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  He's got some club dates and comedy shows that he's going to be promoting.  You don't have the info in front of you, though, right?  Well, I think the 25th of January I'm going to be at Helium.  Oh, yeah, in Philly.  We've got a date now. 
[02:39:30]  All right, good.  Yeah, I'm hoping I can get out in like two days of it.  They're just going to Friday and Saturday.  Like I said, I'm working here, and I can just plug them.  You're not like one of those comics that are just running all over the country every day of the week.  No, and I'm at Riddles.  I hate fuck.  Dude, I'm trying to retire from this running around shit.  I don't like it.  Riddles and Tickle Sides and Hardy Harz in Tennessee or whatever the fuck.  I don't like it, man.  I do not like it, man.  It's too bad because his stuff is just great.  But it's not for everywhere, man. 
[02:40:00]  It's New York.  It's like this radio show.  All right, well, Disturbed's coming in.  And then the pests want to know if it's true, but yeah, it's true.  Howie's going to be feeding you lunch on Friday at the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square.  That was our little secret.  Still hasn't been announced.  They're scrambling now, actually.  All hell has broken loose.  Oh, yeah.  So you think they heard?  All hell has broken loose.  We got our spies.  Trust me on this one.  Trust me.  And the pests are already on it. 
[02:40:30]  They got a press release they're going to be sending out to the media.  White-collar espionage.  Oh, it's great.  That fucking opium is espionage.  This is like Russia versus the United States.  It's the Cold War.  Cold War's back.  Look, we came up with this concept, or actually our fans have, instead of being called the  army and stuff, a lot of shows have that cute army stuff, join the army, join this.  We have what's called pests.  It's the perfect, perfect definition of what these guys do. 
[02:41:00]  You know what the normal radio station's version of their army is?  They have people sign up.  Sign up for our army.  Or our militia.  Yeah.  Our naked militia.  It amounts to a mailing list that the station can send out things for events, show up at  our Budweiser night, we're having it, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, that's what their  army is.  How many hardcore pests?  We never called it pests.  Huh?  How many hardcore, like, invited to the big warrior's speech?  Those numbers are unknown.  Yeah, they're top secret.  And even if we did know, it would be a top secret. 
[02:41:30]  What would you think?  Oh, it's top secret?  Yeah.  You have an idea, but you can't...  I would say 38.  They are in every city.  Who's the hardest motherfucking Sergeant Barnes out there, Pess?  Well, there's a few, and they're battling it out, and they might take out each other to  become one of those folks.  To be one-on-one.  No, I'm not even kidding.  There's a few going on.  They got shit going on.  Oh, I know Blah Blah is leading the army, but let me tell you about Blah Blah.  Oh, there's some coups going on. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, yeah, man.  Some coup-de-tahs up in this building.  Coup-de-tah.  There's some John Gotti's up in this building.  Oh, yeah, there is.  There's also...  Someone's going to be laying in front of Sparks.  A big steakhouse with a cigar hanging out of his mouth.  A big Paul Castellano.  I can't explain...  I can't explain how deep this Pess thing goes.  It's gotten out of hand, and they did it on their own for the most part.  We gave them a little push, like, hint, hint, this would be kind of cool.  But now they're organizing their meeting when we're sleeping, and they're doing this and  that.  They've got secret websites.  Some of them work for the enemies. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, shit.  And then feed us information.  Yeah.  So the meetings are like, everybody sit down, and the royal order of Pess Buffalo's over it.  Yeah.  And then one guy goes, you know, this fucking guy.  We have a Pess.  I have a Pess that works at the Hard Rock Cafe.  He's already written in, what can I do?  It's nuts how crazy it's gone.  What can I fucking do?  Don't worry.  But Howie's got this...  Shit, the food?  God damn, what can you do?  This big announcement.  He's basically going to do it on Andy Kaufman, even though Howie doesn't rip off anybody. 
[02:43:00]  And he's going to bring a bunch of his listeners, a lot of his listeners.  It looks like in a double-decker bus to the Hard Rock Cafe for free lunch on Friday.  So we're inviting all the Pess to join us at the Hard Rock Cafe this Friday for free lunch  on Howie.  Make sure you wear your XM and Opie and Anthony t-shirts under your coats and stuff.  Is it winners of a contest?  No, no.  No.  No, this just seems to be...  It's just people.  Hey, fans.  It's going to be the big thing that he does. 
[02:43:30]  Because I don't think he's going to be allowed to do his cute little march.  We'll get more info.  We're going to have more secrets tomorrow.  Yeah.  More secrets tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony program.  But that's one that...  You know, at this point, I don't even know if he's going to announce it because we really  fucked it up.  We have fucked this one up.  But, you know, if he announces it, then it's happening.  It's Friday at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Free lunch.  Free lunch for all our pests.  Bring the homeless.  So, stay after to eat.  And bring your XM logos and your Opie and Anthony t-shirts. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, my God.  And have fun with it.  That's right.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  Let's go to Canada.  Danny?  Yeah?  What's up, Danny?  Not too much, man.  Just chilling, driving down the road.  Say, like, my buddy turned me on to this channel here.  And I haven't changed it since, man.  I listen to your reruns and everything.  I listen to Ron and Phez and everything.  I listen to you guys.  You guys are fucking awesome.  And I was just talking about Patrice's thing.  Patrice is talking about how he's got so many sex toys and everything.  Boom. 
[02:44:30]  I'm the same way, man.  Props, buddy.  You got as many toys as you got.  Props.  The virus has hit Canada, and it's slowly spreading.  The ONA virus.  It's spreading pretty good, though.  I've noticed a lot of people very quickly picking up on the show.  A lot of their friends are turning each other on to it.  Have you ever seen awful...  Oh, yeah.  You guys know, like, I drive trucks.  I'm on the road all the time, and you guys are just like...  You guys wake me up in the morning and put me to sleep at night, man.  You guys are the fucking greatest.  Oh, thanks.  If you want to join one of the message boards, you can start with Wackbag.com. 
[02:45:00]  W-A-C-K-Bag.com.  And maybe we'll get some Canadian pests.  Who knows?  Thanks, Danny.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll be down there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thanks, Danny.  George in New York City.  George?  Yo.  Yo.  First rule of Pest Club is you do not speak about the Pest Club.  See, they scare us, too, Patrice.  Don't fuck around with them.  No problem.  No one it is, really.  It's a whole Fight Club thing that's happening with this show and the Pest.  Exactly.  They've got little cells in every state now. 
[02:45:30]  Cells?  Little cells, yes.  In every city.  And they're not going to say who the Bin Laden is.  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  No, no, no.  No, there's a car where you're about to be in.  Yeah.  There's a car.  This is a lot like Fight Club.  It's a lot like Fight Club.  Fight Club.  What's going on?  I'm telling you.  Wow.  I don't even know how deep it goes.  I try to get on a couple of these secret websites.  Have you met any of them?  Yeah, we know a few.  But we've tried to get on some of these secret websites, but they don't trust us.  They don't think we're who we are.  It's very difficult.  And we started this whole thing.  Yeah.  We can't even do it.  It's out of our hands.  They do their own press releases now. 
[02:46:00]  They're on all sorts of message boards that trash us and they defend us.  You should see this Pal Talk thing.  You ever seen Pal Talk?  You talk about it.  Yeah, it's webcams or not, if you don't have a webcam or anything, but microphones also.  And a lot of these guys get on there and turn the cameras on and sit and look and talk to each other.  And there seems to be, there was one guy, there's one guy on this Pal Talk that pops in every so often that shoves stuff up his ass. 
[02:46:30]  That's what he does.  That's his thing.  He just sits there and shoves shit up his ass.  And it's hysterical.  Now, if I was home listening to this broadcast today, I'm just a regular guy sitting there, I'm not working.  Sure.  And I go, you know what?  I'm going to be a fucking pest.  Because, am I in just by going down there with my thing?  There used to be a time you could just get in just like that. 
[02:47:00]  I'm down there going, yeah, O&A and the whole XM.  And I'm like, hey, everybody, I'm a pest too.  Is it that easy?  You've got to prove yourself now.  I think you've got to know somebody and you've got to prove yourself.  But I think you can do that.  Show a little loyalty first.  And then, you know, get on the message board and go, hey, I was down there.  Yeah.  Here's a picture of me.  And then they'd be like, hey, good job.  Do I have to do what's equivalent to a hit?  You've got to make your bones.  You've got to make your bones as pledging probably at this point and beat downs. 
[02:47:30]  Beaten in.  You've got to get beaten in.  You've got to get kicked in the face.  How long do you have to last?  30 seconds or something like that.  And then you're going to start off as low man.  That's right.  Low man.  That's right.  Oh, man.  Because there's infiltrators.  Yeah, they want to make sure it's not an infiltrator.  Oh, spies, they've got to make sure.  I mean, the spies, they pretty much know who they are.  If you showed up, let's say Friday, and you had a sign, big sign, something like that,  pictures were taken of you, they end up on the message board and you go, hey, that's 
[02:48:00]  me on the right.  And I'm now a member of the message board and stuff.  You would be warmly accepted.  That's right.  Yeah.  That's how it works.  Fans could still show up.  Oh, yeah.  And then they've got the pest that control the whole thing.  Oh, yeah.  We're doing an appearance tomorrow, by the way, not to confuse everything.  We're going to be at J&R Music downtown near City Hall, near Ground Zero.  It's called Park Row downtown.  I don't know where that is.  Yeah, it's kind of weird to get to that J&R because it's the opposite direction on the 
[02:48:30]  one way that heads towards Battery Park.  Uh-oh.  So you kind of got to take a left to get in there.  It's like a little enclave thing going on, but it's right there in the city hall.  It says downtown Park Row, J&R Music World.  Anthony and I will be there tomorrow at 1230, hopefully with a lot of giveaways.  Xbox 360s, maybe?  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  That they give you and you can't use?  Why not?  Let's go to a guy who's had XM for two years. 
[02:49:00]  Mark in Michigan.  Mark?  Gentlemen, you are geniuses, man.  I'll tell you what.  I used to surf the radio around and I'd hit you guys every once in a while, but for whatever  reason over the last week and a half, you guys have hooked me and every day I turn you  guys on.  I work for a mobile medical firm and I'm in nursing home parking lots a lot and I can't  tell you how many times you guys almost get me fired.  I have to sprint to the van to shut the door because, you know, you guys are over the  top of me talking, you know, sweat and stuff like that.  And you've got these old people that are like, you know, and I know you guys are about to 
[02:49:30]  drop the F-bomb, you know, and I'm like, oh shit, I've got to get the door shut, man.  And people are looking at me funny because you guys are talking about the weirdest shit,  tissue time and all this.  I just wanted to say you guys are awesome.  Oh, thank you.  We haven't done a tissue time in a while.  And after all that gay shit yesterday with Gangsta Fag, I was listening to that on the  replay, just laughing my ass off.  Thanks, Mark.  God damn, was that some funny shit.  Yeah, definitely was.  Gangsta Fag.  Gangsta Fag.  He still hasn't contacted anybody, right?  No, we've got to get in touch with Gangsta Fag. 
[02:50:00]  Get him on the phone.  We've got Brokeback Mountain Audio.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Who's one of the stars?  Jake...  Gillingham.  Gillingham or whatever.  However you say his name.  And they're talking Oscar.  They're talking Oscar for Heath Ledger.  Thank God.  That's the only way to get you out of Brokeback Mountain.  Oof.  Yeah, it earned seven Globe nominations.  Golden Globe or whatever.  Yeah, you can't.  If you're going to be one.  I was a fag for no reason and in the cut.  Yeah.  Just a no reason fag.  I'm a fan of this new show, Showtime on Comedy Central with David Spade, because he's just 
[02:50:30]  messing with the celebrities like he does.  But he's upped his game big time since he was doing this on SNL.  Right.  And he sent one of his guys out to interview Jake.  What's his last name again?  Gillingham.  All right.  About the movie.  About the movie.  Gillinghal.  What's his name there, that thing?  I believe it's Gyllenhaal.  Gyllenhaal?  Gyllenhaal.  All right.  Gyllenhaal.  And David Spade sent one of his reporters out there to interview him.  And the first question the reporter goes is, so tell me about this gay cowboy movie. 
[02:51:00]  Right to his face.  That's what it is.  Why would he go...  All right.  I'll tell you about it.  He's like, it is what it is.  I wish I knew I had to quit you.  Yeah.  So tell me about this gay cowboy movie, you know.  Obviously, this guy took this role because he thinks it's going to help his acting career.  He's paying it very seriously.  It's not the gay thing.  It's the story and the meaning behind it.  Right.  Broke back mountain.  Right.  And he's just writing it off as, hey, the gay cowboy movie.  Yeah, what do you got on it?  So listen to what he says. 
[02:51:30]  He showed restraint here because I was thinking maybe he should have gotten in his face and  punched him or something.  But this is what he said.  The gay cowboy movie is not the appropriate title or explanation for it.  My character, I play this guy, Jack Twist, who's a rodeo cowboy or a bad rodeo cowboy.  And he's a ranch hand and he meets up with another ranch hand in the summer and they fall in love.  Aw, it's just a lot.  Gay cowboy movie.  Gay cowboy movie.  You just expect, like, if it wasn't a name for it and he's just that explanation, you go, 
[02:52:00]  hey, what are you doing in the future?  Like, they interview him after the day, after tomorrow or Bubble Boy.  Right.  What are you doing next?  I'm doing a movie about two guys that go up into the mountains and they were ranchers and  they, you know, they fall in love.  Oh, a gay cowboy movie.  Gay cowboys.  Right?  Yeah.  Right?  You're, uh, one guy's a rodeo, one guy's a rancher.  They're cowboy.  Gay?  Gay cowboy movie.  All right, listen.  I smell, I smell a bit.  Uh-oh.  Are we going to send Derek and Travis? 
[02:52:30]  Why Derek?  Derek wants to do this.  Derek doesn't do this shit.  It's going to be Danny and Nathaniel and maybe Travis, right?  Wow.  You really want to do it, Derek?  No, Derek doesn't want to do this shit.  I know Derek.  Derek doesn't do that.  Derek likes to be more behind the scenes.  Derek's the pilot.  Derek likes, uh, he's got skills, but he doesn't need to be on the radio.  Nathaniel.  Nathaniel should do it.  Definitely.  We've got to send these guys to the theaters that are showing these movies.  Yeah.  And get, uh, get some interviews as they're coming out of the theater.  Oh, yeah.  Only couples. 
[02:53:00]  A guy coming out with his girl.  Oh, I thought a guy coming out with a guy.  Oh, a guy coming out with his no fun.  This is this.  Yay!  No, that could be funny on the radio, though.  Nathaniel, come in here.  Fantastic.  Nathaniel's perfect for this.  We've got to get the, uh...  I love the two thumbs up my ass.  Ooh, Andrew Dice Gay.  Andrew Dice Gay, uh, thinking, uh, about doing some radio with us today.  We'll see what happens.  Nathaniel, so, uh, you've got to go and do this. 
[02:53:30]  All right.  Could you do it today?  Uh, no.  All right.  Well, I want to get this done by the end of the week, though.  Okay.  How about by Friday?  By Friday?  All right.  I'll go with you.  Will you?  Uh, yeah, I'll buy some popcorn.  But what I do is I cut a hole in the bottom, right?  And I stick my manhood through it.  And as you're asking for popcorn, oh, could I have some popcorn?  Yeah, dig right in.  And as you're digging in, I'm buttering the popcorn, oh! 
[02:54:00]  I've seen it three times.  It's fantastic.  You like the movie Dice?  Yeah.  Two fists up.  I'll bend over.  Oh!  Andrew Dice Gay.  Got a question for you, Andrew Dice Gay.  I'm over here now.  You could ask.  How much money would it take for you to do a movie like this?  I'd do it for free.  Yeah, why?  Uh, just, you know, to build up my, uh, my resume.  Yeah.  My movie resume.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that look good? 
[02:54:30]  Would it, Fort Fairlane?  Uh-huh.  Right?  I did that one.  And then, uh, I did the other one.  Fort Fairlane.  Casual sex?  Casual sex.  Yeah.  I was in that one.  And then the fag cowboy movie, as I like to call it.  Sure.  And then it ends.  See, I'd have a different ending.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I'd go to, uh, Seattle, Washington, and get fucked by a horse and die.  They do that up there. 
[02:55:00]  You ever hear me fuck a chicken?  Da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da.  Oh!  Andrew Dice Gay, everyone.  Andrew Dice Gay.  How in all the years that we've fucking been on the air and known Dice and fucked with Dice  and did it at Dice Impresions, did Andrew Dice Gay never come up?  Because we have the greatest listeners.  They helped us out with the show.  Right.  Someone came up with that yesterday.  All it took was one of you assholes out there to say it. 
[02:55:30]  So here's the deal.  We gotta get, uh, interviews with people leaving the theater after Brokeback Mountain.  And also Kong.  Because we're hearing, like, guys are walking out of the previews without crying and stuff.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh, if you could get Weeping Gentleman.  Uh, that would be fantastic.  That would be terrific.  And, dude, the love between the...  All right, we got some more, uh, Brokeback Mountain audio.  That name is genius.  Brokeback.  Doesn't it sound like some kind of gay sex? 
[02:56:00]  It's just horrible.  Violet, like I was fucking him in the ass and his back just snapped and we were on the  mountain and I don't know what the fuck to do.  Brokeback Mountain.  It would just be the mountain.  Right.  The mountain or something.  Call it the mountain.  Mountain.  Where they go.  Is it...  Because isn't it where they go?  To have their little liaisons and stuff?  Yeah, I guess every year or something.  Brokeback.  I guess they couldn't call it Suck Dick Mountain.  It's like the closest they can come this summer from Universal Pictures. 
[02:56:30]  Suck Dick Mountain.  Nah.  Or, yeah, just call it Mountain.  Like there.  What did he do to you?  Mountain.  Broke my back.  Brokeback Mountain.  I'm going to give you a Brokeback Mountain today.  Reach around hills.  A love story.  We have audio of one of the love scenes. 
[02:57:00]  Roman War Helmet Valley.  Oh, my God.  We have audio of one of the love scenes.  Oh, great.  This is just a romantic scene.  Roman War Helmet Valley.  We have audio of one of the love scenes from...  Rimjob Reveal.  Coming to a theater near you. 
[02:57:30]  God damn it.  Give me a pen and a piece of paper.  Oh, man.  Who else is in?  Anal Swamp.  Glory Hole Gulch.  Of the hole to it.  God damn.  All right.  We have audio of one of the love scenes from Brokeback Mountain.  All right.  Let's hear it.  Here it is.  This is not it. 
[02:58:00]  Makes it fun?  You Hühnerficker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ich bin ganz wild auf dieser Henne.  Christian.  Yeah.  Ja. 
[02:58:30]  Ah, nun wird's gut.  Ja, gleich.  Ja.  And you thought chickens couldn't cry.  Big Nazi bastard.  That is a chicken crying.  I don't care what you tell me. 
[02:59:00]  Let's go to Lynn in New Jersey.  Lynn.  Hey.  Oh, what's up?  Hey.  Um, well, you guys were talking about it being a fag cowboy movie.  Shouldn't it then start Imus with his fag cowboy hat?  That would be funny.  I, um, uh, can't quit you, uh, McCord.  We're gonna, uh, fuck you in the ass now, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  We have a, uh, a clip of one of the, um, love scenes from Brokeback Mountain.  Um, now I know why they called it Brokeback Mountain after you hear this clip. 
[02:59:30]  All right.  It's obvious someone was, uh, being broken.  Oh.  Maybe broken.  Yeah.  Let's go to that clip now.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[03:00:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  And you know one of them was gayed and the other one of one's probably a method actor.  The other one's like, uh, after that director goes cut, he's a done with the scenes type of  motherfucker.  I'm like, what the...  Why do you keep your tongue in my mouth that extra second? 
[03:00:30]  Oh, motherfucker.  Fellas, I want you to take it to the limit.  What the fuck, you?  And cut.  Get your fucking hands off me, man.  All right, guys, it's going to be a difficult scene.  We're striking the set of anybody that doesn't have to be here.  It's going to be the cameraman, the director, and the sound guy.  That's it.  And everyone else is leaving to make you feel more comfortable with this.  And one guy just a little too much. 
[03:01:00]  One guy, cut.  And the guy's like, they pull their faces away.  And one guy's face follows the other guy.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, you said you weren't gay.  I didn't hear cut.  After that set of, Ang Lee's like, okay.  Ang Lee goes, all right, action fags.  I'm going to be serious, you know, to respect you two as actors.  All right. 
[03:01:30]  Just before they say, all right, faggots.  Fag sons of bitches.  They set the scene, and just before they yell action, you hear,  one of those on set.  Well, we've got more names for the gay cowboy movie coming in.  Tony in Jersey.  Tony.  Yeah.  Balloon, not hill.  Let's go to David in Atlanta.  David.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, I've got a name for that movie. 
[03:02:00]  All right.  Call it Mount Men.  Mount Men.  Mount Men.  Very good.  All right.  We've got...  Brokeback Mount Men.  How about Grunt Valley?  Well, we've got audio of the love scene from Brokeback Mount.  Brokeback Mount.  All right.  Here we'll listen.  All right.  All right.  Oh, shit.  Ah!  Ah! 
[03:02:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  What the hell was that?  Ah, that might have been, uh...  Something.  Let me see that.  Makes the chicken video look like a joke.  Yeah, have you...  Is that... 
[03:03:00]  Is that...  Oh, is that what that is?  Do you have a video of that?  Nice.  No, no.  That's...  That's...  That would be illegal.  Would it?  I've seen that before.  You didn't see it from us.  Oh, okay.  I love that video.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Heath Ledger...  Money shot.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  Okay.  Terrific.  Heath Ledger was on Good Morning America, and this is what he had to say about Broke Back 
[03:03:30]  Mountain.  You got your wife and baby and...  Okay, I gotta set this.  This is an actual clip from the movie.  A clip.  I'm sorry.  You got your wife and baby and Texas and...  You know, I got my life in Riverton.  That's so.  You and Alma, that's a lie.  Oh, you shut up about Alma.  This ain't our fault.  The bottom line is, we're around each other, and this thing grabs hold of us again, in 
[03:04:00]  the wrong place, in the wrong time, and we're dead.  Wrong place, wrong time.  This thing grabs hold of us.  Like, they could just be hanging out with their families.  They're supposed to be living this lie, and they're hanging...  Uh-oh, this thing's grabbing hold of me.  Just lays him on the picnic table out back.  What the...  What are you doing?  I don't know some thing.  Just grab hold of me, and I needs to fuck this man in the ass. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, like gay wolfman.  Yeah.  They turn on half a moon.  Half a moon.  I can't hold it.  Oh, my God, it's a half moon.  Baby, you gotta lock me in the basement, or I'm gonna do some damage.  Now, when that pretty boy goes away, you gonna let me out.  But until then, you gotta keep me locked in here.  Are you gonna see something you don't wanna see?  Oh.  Oh, reee! 
[03:05:00]  Cowboy fag movie.  That's what it is.  That's wonderful.  It's a gay cowboy movie.  Let's go to Jay in Chicago.  Jay.  Hey, how's it going, O&A?  We're having a good time today.  Good deal.  How about No Vag Valley?  No Vag Valley.  Yeah.  That's coming too.  Very good.  Awesome.  What is the story?  Are they both married?  Do they both have girlfriends?  I think...  Yeah.  I get to describe the plot.  Yes, man. 
[03:05:30]  I think in their youth, they meet each other.  Speak slower.  In their youth, they meet each other.  Get all gay with each other.  It's some kind of a passing little thing.  Yeah.  Then they go off and start families.  They start families.  And then reunite.  Reunite and take up where they left off.  Yeah.  They can't just look at each other and go,  Hey, that was a little awkward back then.  Oops.  Hey, look, I'm married now.  Sort of a thing.  I don't know what the fuck that was.  Look, I'm gonna move all the way over there. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, this is uncomfortable.  Just tell them I died.  Will it be a two?  Brokeback two.  Brokeback two.  Scrotum showdown.  You know the sequels are always awful.  All right, here we go.  Heath Ledger talks about doing gay sex scenes.  Ah, wow.  There must have been something about doing this.  And Jake has talked about it, too.  Straight men.  In love scenes.  Gotta make you nervous. 
[03:06:30]  You choreographed them, I assume,  when you're doing love scenes with females.  Is this a different kind of thing?  Ah, yeah.  The rehearsal of these scenes  were more or less conversational.  You hear how manly he is?  I've heard interviews with Heath Ledger over the years.  I've never heard him sound like that.  That guy's been in a bunch of good movies.  You know they both run around Hollywood  just fucking in public.  Hey, at the donut shop.  Hey, I'm fucking a bitch.  Let me get a blast.  I have never heard Heath Ledger  sound like that in my life. 
[03:07:00]  Give me a crumpet.  Suck my dick, bitch.  I've seen other movies where he's like,  well, it was a difficult role.  I really had to get into shape for it.  Now it's like,  what about the gay scenes with other men?  Yeah, well, Jesus Christ,  let me tell you something.  He's got a can of Schaefer beer  around here or something.  Yeah, rough, but I'm just acting.  I'll tell you if you let me rub your pussy  right now, 
[03:07:30]  because I've got to rub some pussy  when I'm talking.  This is great.  And listen to how uncomfortable he sounds.  We just need to,  you know, guys,  we understand you're straight,  and you're just acting.  This is an acting thing.  We understand your sexuality.  All right, we need the faggots on the set.  Faggots, faggots,  make your way on the set  for the fag butt fuck scene.  Attention all faggots. 
[03:08:00]  We've got to handle this thing.  We're going to handle this  with respect, professionalism.  You are actors.  You've done movies,  and we understand this is a difficult scene.  That's what we're going to need.  Cocksucker scene.  Can we set up for the cocksucker scene  and have the faggots on set  for the big cocksucker scene?  Oh, what an uncomfortable movie  that must have been to make, man.  Oh, no shit.  All he had to do  was just say that he did it. 
[03:08:30]  You know, I'm doing it to get an Oscar.  If you're one of these actors,  are you making sure  you're duct taping your junk down?  Oh.  Just in case it's a goof  and some blood starts flowing,  you're like, what the fuck?  All right, chaps,  come down,  cock in the ass,  take two.  What the fuck is naming these scenes?  Take two.  You know they wanted to say  after the first take is  he wants to hear check the gates.  Yeah, check the gates.  All right, check the gates. 
[03:09:00]  All right.  Imagine you get through the whole scene  and the director goes,  we're going to have to do it again  because, ah, the lighting was a little...  You know, that scene we did yesterday  where you were fucking him in the ass  for hours,  we looked at the dailies and, ah...  I got to tell you,  at first...  Yeah.  It was a great take, but, ah...  Great, but you know something?  We were getting a lens flare  that really wasn't good.  The boom mic kind of got in the shot.  Yeah, the boom...  And then boom mic people,  when they hear a noise,  they don't say shit until the end. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  They don't...  They're not allowed to cut.  So if there's a plane or a train going by  afterwards, they'll go,  I didn't know.  They didn't cut.  And they'll just stand just like...  Do it again.  I wonder if there's going to be  a director's cut  when it comes out on DVD.  The Ang Lee cut.  The director's cut.  All the scenes  that you never wanted to see.  Let's go to Missouri.  David.  Yeah, man.  There is no way in hell  those two guys can be  freaking straight  and have done that.  They've got to be  a bunch of queers, man. 
[03:10:00]  I'm telling you.  I'm having a hard time  with this one.  Bunch of queers.  You try to have an open mind  and try to figure out  why they would...  I don't get this one.  There ain't no way, man.  Here are guys  that are working together  in the entertainment field.  They're making a movie.  They're doing something like that.  Why is it  that that...  But, dude...  That is acceptable to...  How do you ask a guy...  It's like,  Fan.  All right, Fan.  Here's what we need for the show.  Uh-oh.  Here's what we need.  We need you  and Hawk  to just make out. 
[03:10:30]  All right?  And go.  Like, how is that...  Oh, stop!  Don't really do it.  Guys!  A little visual.  Theater of the Mind.  But these guys...  How do you ask guys to...  These two guys  aren't hacks in Hollywood.  You know,  and if you read about it...  Well, Heath Ledger...  What does that mean?  Heath Ledger is...  He's on the fence.  But, I mean,  he probably needs us more than...  But he's still getting scripts, man.  Heath Ledger wants to be  the other guy  from Lord of the Rings.  Do you know who  the new Heath Ledger is?  Who?  It's the kid that was in, um... 
[03:11:00]  Uh...  What's the racing car movie?  He did two of them.  Come on.  Paul Walker?  No, what's the...  Luke,  Fast and Furious?  Fast and Furious?  Okay.  That kid's the new Heath Ledger.  The one that was in the movie  with, um...  Really?  The surf movie.  You watch a lot of movies, bro.  What's the movie  with that sexy Alba?  Jessica Alba?  He was in one with...  He's the new...  He's the new.  He's the new Heath Ledger.  Yeah.  He's...  We don't need Heath Ledger anymore.  What was Heath Ledger's, like,  he was in The Patriot, too, right?  Oh, right.  He was in The Patriot 
[03:11:30]  with Mel Gibson.  Mel Gibson.  A nothing's nothing.  That was kind of his break.  I kind of like that movie.  Kind of broke him into the business.  He was the star of the night movie,  and they realized  he wasn't a star.  I kind of like that night movie.  Of course you did,  but it's like,  I kind of like Waterworld.  Waterworld was good.  Wait, which one?  I'm talking about the one  that was kind of a comedy, right?  Brokeback Castle?  No, it wasn't a comedy.  It was a...  It was the one that  was kind of a goof.  A rocker.  No.  It had, like,  modern rock music in it.  Yeah.  Which one was that?  That was...  It was, like,  A Knight's Tale.  Okay.  Yeah, A Knight's Tale.  That was, like,  A rock A Knight's Tale.  Delicious. 
[03:12:00]  Nice.  A little trapdoor  on his ass.  But Heath is in trouble, man.  And Jake...  Jake really wasn't  doing shit either,  to be honest with you.  No, Jake is rising.  He's in the business.  It can't be too...  You know who the Jake...  Jake is going to be a ward.  Heath Ledger was in  The Lords of Dogtown.  So what?  What?  That had a little...  Who the fuck saw that?  That wasn't even...  That was Channel 10  on a plane.  That ain't it.  No.  Jake was in  A Day After Tomorrow  recently, so...  But do you know  who Jake is going 
[03:12:30]  to have a war with?  Remember the kid  that was in  Black Hawk Down?  That's the Jake...  Josh Harnett?  Josh Harnett  and Jake Gyllenhaal.  They got a war.  It only can be  one motherfucker  who does that.  That guy.  That guy.  It can't be...  Like, so Jake's  going to out-fag...  You think these two  went off on their own  and rehearsed  some of these scenes  together, too?  Yes.  Oh, no.  What do you think?  They're studying?  Oh, fucking awkward.  Yeah, they did  because they're trying  to be into character, man.  How can you go  in and out of fag?  You can't.  That's who he's trying  to be, the Orlando Bloom. 
[03:13:00]  You think he's a method actor?  He's trying to be Orlando Bloom.  He has to be...  Orlando Bloom  would have been  a better choice  for this movie.  Well, that's who  he's trying to be  is Orlando Bloom.  Oh, Jake?  No.  Heath.  Heath.  No, he can't.  Orlando, he's not...  He's trying.  He wants to be that.  All right, listen.  Let's say...  He hasn't reached  that point of stardom.  Let's get the rest  of this clip over with, okay?  We start from the beginning.  Heath Ledger  doing gay sex scenes.  There must have been  something about doing this,  and Jake has talked  about it, too. 
[03:13:30]  Straight men.  In love scenes...  She's diddling herself  during this.  Gotta make you nervous.  You choreographed them,  I assume,  when you're doing  love scenes with females.  Is this a different  kind of thing?  Yeah.  The rehearsal  of these scenes  were more or less  conversational.  But I think  what made it easier  was that there was,  in fact,  there were stories  within the scenes.  There were goals  that we wanted to achieve.  You know,  Aang didn't just  roll the camera  and say,  okay, boys,  have fun with it now,  you know? 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  And look,  I think in the end  of the day,  what it really took  is just,  and I think  it's a way  for acting in general  with me,  it's just kind of  harnessing this  infinite power  of belief.  Yeah.  There it is.  I'm acting.  Oh, yeah.  He's very nervous.  Oh, I have  channeled  the god of faggots.  Yeah.  The great fump war.  So,  what he's saying 
[03:14:30]  is they would  hang around  like rehearsal  and be like,  you know,  the fire  sure is warm  here  at Brookback Mountain  in the camp.  Yeah,  it certainly,  I love you.  I love you too.  Lean in  for a kiss  and here's  where we kiss.  Ah,  the kissing  is continuing.  Like they wouldn't  actually do it.  And he sounds  like a grizzle,  he sounds like  John Wayne  mixed with  fucking  Clint Eastwood.  He's like,  Heath Ledger?  All of a sudden,  he's got to be,  do these interviews 
[03:15:00]  like,  watch out,  man.  He's like,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  The acting part.  Now he's  Nick Nolte voice  and shit.  Hey,  convict.  Here's your  goddamn dinner,  convict.  I want  Billy Bear.  We're going to send  the guys to do  some interviews  after the movie  if let's out.  We'll see what  people think  about Brokeback Mountain.  Brokeback Mountain.  Hey,  what's going on  with Disturbed? 
[03:15:30]  They got,  we'll be in  tomorrow morning  at 9 a.m.  It's,  go figure,  the band got  their schedule  confused.  We'll decide  if they're going  to be here  tomorrow morning  at 9 a.m.  We might be  too busy.  All right,  Bad Santa  on the front page  of the New York  Post.  We've got to get  to this before  we get out of  here.  Bloody St.  Nick leaves  kids sick.  Yeah.  That was Steve  Paul.  Oh,  look at that  Brokeback Mountain  Golden Globe  nominations. 
[03:16:00]  They're showing  clips.  Oh,  that's how it  started.  He was healing  it.  Had a baby  with,  so great  news coming  out of that  camp.  They must  be celebrating  today for sure.  But yeah,  this film has  done extremely  well.  I mean,  over the  weekend it  got awards  with New York  film critics  as well as  Los Angeles  film critics  and in Boston  it did  extremely well.  So that's  what's bringing  it to the  forefront.  But Sabela,  what happened  to the other  guy who's  lead actor  in that movie,  that Gillenhall,  Gillenhall,  whatever.  Jake Gillenhall. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah,  everyone thought  it was his year.  I mean,  he did Proof  this year  and also  Jarhead  and he was,  you know,  they're also  talking about  his performance  in Brokeback Mountain  but he did not  get a nomination.  all that for  he did not  but no nomination  for Jake Gillenhall.  He didn't get  nominated,  but he's  blessed to  this.  I'll tell you  what,  he played a  better faggot  than him.  He's got a  fucking enema  right now  dushing  like nothing,  you motherfucker,  nothing.  I got it.  I got this one,  man.  They took a look,  the committee  or whatever 
[03:17:00]  and said,  damn,  man,  that guy  isn't acting  what so ever.  We can't give him  a Golden Globe  for acting.  Isn't it for acting,  right?  We can't give him  a Golden Globe.  He's going to  just shove it in  his hands  with a fat shissy.  They're previewing  that movie  and go,  wait a minute.  Like,  giving a dog  an acting award  for eating his food.  He's just going  to do it.  Holy shit.  That guy's not acting.  Somebody's going  to be the fag  fall guy  on this movie.  Oh, wow.  Heath is making  sure he's going 
[03:17:30]  to be on the  behind the scenes,  they're going  to go,  look,  one of these  motherfuckers  has got to be  a fag.  Behind the scenes,  Heath is going  to be the one  that's like,  dude,  he said cut.  Heath is getting  nominated for  being a good actor  and the other guy  gave the nomination  to the top.  It was just a fag.  Yeah,  the top  got the nomination.  It was just  a documentary to Jake.  Just following me  around with a camera. 
[03:18:00]  Can we,  can we put me  in the best  documentary category?  Let's see,  the nomination is  a Michael Moore movie  and me and  broke back  mount.  Broke back  mount was a documentary  and a feature film.  Best real sequence  when Jake was  sucking dick.  Best acting  when Heath  was getting  his dick sucked.  how the award 
[03:18:30]  goes to  so excited.  Wow.  And next up,  the best award  for best anal scene.  It's like the fucking  porn awards  over there  at the Golden Globes.  Best DP.  Oh,  shit.  One's a good actor  and one was  a little  just there.  Just give me  honorable mention  for getting  fucked in my butt.  Hey,  we gotta get the  front page 
[03:19:00]  of the New York  Post on one  of our websites  because it's  a great picture.  Bad Santa,  bloody Saint Nick,  leads kid sick.  Kid sick.  Basically,  there's this guy  that has a Santa  display and  Santa has a  bloody knife in his  hand and he's  holding a head  in the other  that's all bloody.  Severed head.  Severed head  and the other  and look at  the post.  Always funny,  right from the  first sentence,  Opie.  Sleigh bells  are ringing  outside and  it says  sleigh is in  quotation marks  for the other 
[03:19:30]  use of the word  sleigh.  And they spell  it the way  you're supposed  to be a murderer.  Sleigh bells  are ringing  outside a  three million  dollar Manhattan  brownstone  where Jolly  Saint Nick has  been replaced  by a bloody  bearded Santa  holding a knife  in one hand  and a severed  head of a doll  blood gushing  from its eye  sockets  and the other  bizarre display  has sent kids  running and  even sparked  a call to  cops.  You know,  the cops are  busy people.  To leave them  alone for  fucking display  things. 
[03:20:00]  They've had a  couple of their  own shot  lately.  They don't need  to be dealing  with your stupid  complaint.  It says  this tis the  season to be  creepy display  which has drawn  no small amount  of community  ire.  You missed  the big  headline when  you finally  turned to  page three  where it  tells you  to go.  The headline  Opie,  oh holy  oh holy  anyone?  Night!  Night is  what you  would say  oh holy  fright.  Fright.  Fright.  Get it? 
[03:20:30]  So just look  at this guy.  Was he just  trying to say  fuck Christmas  and fuck kids  and I hate  I can't get  past their  stupid things  like the  first line  here.  Ho ho  no.  The post  should be  firebombed  for their  comedy  attempts.  The guy's  pretty creepy  looking.  Alright.  Probably just  an artist or 
[03:21:00]  something.  I don't know.  In another  touch of  Christmas  cheer,  the Santa  dummy is  standing behind  a tree.  whose bare  branches are  adorned with  beheaded  Barbie dolls.  It's brought  the ire of  the community.  It's in the  front yard of  Joel Krupnik  and his  wife.  Joel Krupnik  sounds like a  serial killer  name.  He looks like  a kid toucher.  And his  wife,  Mildred.  He looks angry. 
[03:21:30]  They are  protesting the  commercialization  of the Yule  season.  Christmas has  religious origins.  It's in the  Bible.  Santa's not  in the Bible.  He's not a  religious symbol.  Santa Claus has  become a piece  of Americana.  Yeah.  So?  Well,  that's what  he's saying.  He's saying  this is why  he's doing it.  Yeah.  Krupnik,  who dabbles  in real estate,  said if anyone's  offended,  they could simply  cross the street.  And some  children have  done just  that,  the Post  reports. 
[03:22:00]  Other people  have called the  cops only to be  told there was  nothing they could  do.  They should go  and arrest the  people that  could have  called the  cops for  tying up...  Please leave  our cops  alone.  The cops?  They're busy  on real shit.  And one woman  chased this guy  down the block  screaming epithets  at her.  Epithets.  chased the wife  down the street,  I guess.  Outside the home  also decorated  with gargoyles,  lizards,  and dragons,  there were many  who accused a  couple of 
[03:22:30]  dreaming of a  fright Christmas.  This is like  a nightmare  before Christmas.  So?  Mm-hmm.  These people  are possessed,  fumed Lori  Levinson.  Little Jimmy,  who was passing  by,  said,  I thought it  was a very  gory and bloody.  Christmas is not  supposed to be  gory.  It stinks  and I don't  like it.  It's bad,  agreed Sean,  age five.  Santa's face  and hair are red.  Santa shouldn't  look like that.  Stupid five-year-old. 
[03:23:00]  His brother,  Ryan Nine,  chimed in.  Santa makes toys  and he lives  in the North Pole.  He doesn't have  a haunted house  like that.  Nine years old?  And he's still,  uh,  yeah.  Oh, any kids  listening?  There is no  Santa.  I'll be,  I'll be,  I'll be.  There is no  Santa.  You're ruining it  for the children  that are listening.  It's your parents.  There is no  Santa.  We used to get  in such trouble.  There is no  Santa Claus. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  It's weird.  It said,  uh,  Javin Nine.  No,  Seven.  Javin.  Or something like that.  It's not Gavin?  With a J?  J?  All right,  Gavin with a J.  Why don't you spell  the names right,  people?  Javon?  Stop being cute.  I don't know,  I'd say Javin.  J-A-V-I-N.  Yeah,  well.  I'm gonna go with  Javin.  All right.  It's probably  Gavin spelled wrong.  You see his last  name, though.  What?  Boze?  That might be  the Boze kid. 
[03:24:00]  What the hell  is the Boze kid?  The ad to the  Boze fucking...  Damn,  yeah.  Evan Boze.  All right,  well,  there you go.  It's great,  though.  It's a great  front page today  in the New York  Post.  Anything to  shake shit up.  Of course,  why not?  Hey,  I went for my  pistol license  yesterday,  finally.  I need four  friends as  references.  You don't have  four friends?  In Nassau County?  I don't have,  I don't leave my 
[03:24:30]  house.  Like,  I need four  references,  but they're not  really,  it's not really  like references.  They're just  four people  that you  kind of  know.  Four people  that live  in Nassau County.  They can't  be cops.  How about  the cook  you're having  sex with?  No,  and I'm  not.  And she  lives in  Suffolk.  I know  everyone I  know lives  in Suffolk  County or  the city,  and I need  four people  that live  in Nassau  County that  can't be  cops.  Right.  I know a  couple of  cops in  New York,  in Nassau  County,  but quite 
[03:25:00]  the little  quandary I'm  having,  I'm thinking  I need to  make a couple  of friends  in Nassau  County.  Perhaps  people on  Wackbag,  perhaps  message board  people that  could email  me and we  can maybe  be friends.  Start up a  friendship?  Look,  I need four  fucking people.  This is a  license to  carry in the  streets or  whatever.  Don't you  have enough  guns?  I need  pistols.  You need  a license,  a permit to  have a  pistol. 
[03:25:30]  Pistol  permit.  You could  buy rifles  and shotguns,  but I need  pistols.  Yeah.  Pistol  packing  motherfucker.  I like  going to  the range.  I like  shooting.  You like  shooting?  I'm going  to give  you a  Desert Eagle  for your  birthday.  That would  be nice.  If you  want to be  Anthony's  Nassau  County friend,  how do they  get a hold  of you?  Through  MySpace?  Yes,  they could  get a hold  of me  through  MySpace,  but you  got to  live in  Nassau  County,  New York.  Right.  Right where 
[03:26:00]  I live,  Nassau County,  Nassau.  Yeah,  MySpace  slash  Anthony  Cumia,  C-U-M-I-A.  Okay.  Yeah,  get through  me there,  or Wackbag.  Yeah,  get on Wackbag  and make a  little post,  put a sticky  up there,  if you want  to be my  pal.  All right.  My good  friend.  The cover  of the New  York Post  is up  on  opianthony.com  right now.  Bad Santa,  it's a great  display.  We're going  to go to  break with  the F.U-Line.  Let's see  what's going  on on that  thing today,  okay?  All right.  And we'll  finish the  show next.  The very  worst of 
[03:26:30]  the Opie  and Anthony  F.U-Line.  Hey,  this is Matt  from Revere.  I just want  to give a  big fuck  you out  to fucking  Krispy Kreme.  Get the  fuck out  of Massachusetts,  you motherfuckers.  Hey,  I want to  leave a fuck  you to that  cuntbag  Howard Stern.  Tell that  motherfucking  hook nose  to shut  the fuck  up.  Nobody likes  his ass.  Only people  that remember  him from  back in the  day,  and then  half of  those  motherfuckers  stopped  listening to 
[03:27:00]  him and  listen to  ONA now.  Just fuck  you,  Howard Stern.  Fuck you.  Fuck that  old fact  guy with  gray hair  in the  commercial  who says  diabetes.  It's  pronounced  diabetes,  asshole.  Fuck  you.  I just want  to give a  big fuck  you to  Howard Stern.  I just  saw one of  his stupid  serious  billboards.  It says  let freedom  ring and let  it be  rung by  a stripper.  You have  nothing left.  Kill  yourself.  I got a  big fuck  you for  all you  Howard Stern 
[03:27:30]  cronies that  think that  he's the  god.  Fuck  you.  Fuck  all  you.  Call the  O.P.  Anthony  FU line  at 1-866-FU  line 1-866-FU  line 1-866-FU  line 1-866-FU  line 1-866-FU  fuck you very  much.  All right we have  Martini Steve in  studio. 
[03:28:00]  Does a great job  with the websites  and the production  of the radio show.  Finally got your  robe off huh?  What happened?  Your eyes are like  saucers.  Are they now?  Yeah they still  are.  Pretty big.  He's taking all  these weird  supplements to  work out  Patrice and  this morning he  took a little  too much and  he was sweating  and shivering.  It was like a  cold sweat right?  Yeah it was a  cold sweat.  It's the stuff I  take and I'm  normally very  careful with this  stuff and I  normally don't  exceed the  dosage and  this one product  I take called  Redline comes  with a measuring 
[03:28:30]  spoon and  you're not  supposed to  exceed that  measuring spoon  dosage.  Well I broke  mine yesterday and  I figured I'd been  taking it long  enough that I  could pretty much  eyeball how much  I could take and  you overdo it by  just a little bit  and you break  into these shakes  and I was  literally sitting  at my desk  checking my  email this  morning and I  couldn't stop my  hand from shaking  so I just had  these violent  up and down  shakes trying to  use the mouse  just bam bam  bam bam bam  I couldn't stop  my hand from  shaking.  He was walking  around in one  of those big  Mets robes that  we got.  One of the Mets  robe you gave me 
[03:29:00]  which was very  toasty.  It wasn't going  to fit me man.  That thing was  huge.  I didn't even  wonder why he  was walking  around.  I just looked at  his big ass in  that robe and  I just kept  doing morning  shit.  I'm not that  eccentric man.  I was actually  very cold.  There isn't much  that could happen  here in the  morning that you  just don't  blow off.  Yeah come in  and go  who cares.  Yeah.  Alright we got  a couple things  we want to get  to.  I want to clear  the area here.  Clear the field.  You got some  guy that stage  dives in Norway 
[03:29:30]  and missed.  What's this about?  Oh what's her  name?  Mira Craig.  She's a Norwegian  singer and she  was opening up  for the Fugees  and I guess  what happened  was she tried  to stage dive  and she was  being all cool  and she  overestimated  or underestimated  how far to jump  and all you hear  at the end of  the audio is  just a  well you'll hear  it.  Oh dear lord.  It seems like  nothing until  the last second  here.  Yeah.  The video of that  is great because 
[03:30:00]  she just disappears  off the stage  and you hear  a thud.  That by the way  was horrible. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah that's awful.  Horrible.  Those Norwegians.  She's barking.  Good for her.  And if you're in  Norway you can  open up to the  Fugees.  That's pretty good.  And the crowd  went  Good for her.  And then  Revenge  I don't know if we  played this.  Revenge Against  Campus Thief.  This is what you  get when you  fuck a stranger  in the ass?  Oh some video  clip someone sent  in.  I guess there was 
[03:31:00]  a college.  A lot of thievery  going on in a  college and  somebody found  out who it  was so they  went up to the  guy's car with  a baseball bat  and just went  after him.  Not the kid  itself but just  started bashing in  his windows.  Quite a few  videos like this  online where  people are just  beating the shit  out of cars.  Really?  This is the first  one I've seen.  I haven't really  seen it.  What about that  black guy with the  golf club?  Oh that's  one of my favorites.  Oh yeah.  Whoops.  Alright listen  to this.  This is this  kid.  His name is  Nate.  He steals shit  all over  fucking campus  and he never  gets caught  because he keeps  selling it.  He stole my 
[03:31:30]  fucking skateboard  and this is what  happens when you  fuck a stranger  in the ass.  Damn!  See what  happens?  Do you  see what  happens when  you fuck a  stranger in  the ass?  Do you  see what  happened Nate?  Oh jeez.  That was  cool.  That was  cool.  That was  cool.  I could sit  and watch those  stupid videos  online all  day.  Oh yeah. 
[03:32:00]  You just  troll through  them and it's  like alright  this one is  someone punching  them in the  face.  One of my  favorites is  when they  slap that  girl in the  face.  It's like  at a party  and it's  like high  school age  kids are  hanging out  and there's  a girl  and I  guess some  kind of  bet or  dare or  something went  on where  this guy  was going to  open hand  slap her  across the  face and  she's standing  there and  she goes  just do it  do it as  hard as  you did the  last one  I guess to  a guy.  So this  guy winds  up and  slaps her  in the face 
[03:32:30]  she gets  knocked the  fuck out  down for  the count  out cold  not budging  just knocked  her out with  a slap and  it's fucking  hysterical.  You know she  just had a  big handprint  bruise on the  side of her  face.  And they're  all upper  middle class  suburban white  kids doing  this stuff too.  The chick  fight?  The chick  fight?  The cat  fights?  Are nuts.  I've never  seen so many  cat fight videos  coming in.  Again high school  girls just  pulling at each  other beating  each other up.  I don't think  it's out of  anger.  I think this  is bored  teenagers doing  like a backyard  wrestling kind 
[03:33:00]  of thing.  I could be  wrong but  there can't  be that many  pissed off  girls beating  the shit out  of each other  that want to  document it.  Great shit  out there.  And finally  we're running  out of show  here.  Whiny kid  chiropractic  office and  the tow truck  driver happened  to have a  video camera  with him I  guess to  document whenever  somebody threatens  him or whatever  and he's  videotaping this  kid crying as  his car is being  towed and it's  this two and a  half minute long  negotiation with  the tow truck  driver about why  he shouldn't tow  his car. 
[03:33:30]  Those guys don't  listen.  No.  Meter maids  don't listen.  Go down to  wherever it's  going and pay  the money and  get your car  back.  Save your  breath.  Please!  Please!  Please!  Somebody  call the  police on  this guy.  Somebody  help me.  This is not  even right.  Somebody  help me.  Why are you  doing this?  I have proof  on my house  that I work  as chiropractic  as there.  I asked you  for proof.  You didn't  give me a chance  to come down. 
[03:34:00]  You said  you're going to  call the  police on  me.  He took  my car  and he  started to  drive off  with my  car when  I have  proof  that I  work  as there  on the  goddamn  planet.  Are you  on the  planet?  I don't  have the  money to  get off  the  car.  I wish  I knew  I'd quit  you.  You have  the legal  rights  to tell  you.  That's  what I  was thinking  I was  going to say  actually this  is audio  from Broke  Back Mountain.  This is  the rich  whatever.  They're  going to  lock your  ass up  as a  cop  kid here. 
[03:34:30]  Hey  you have  the legal  rights  to  you.  We have  a contract  with that  hospital  right there.  901  901  Dover.  Dover.  There's  no  hospital  care.  There's  a  cop  office.  That's  it.  Well,  whatever  it is.  901  Dover.  Call.  Do you  want my  number?  I got  it on  video.  That's  all right.  That's  all right.  Yeah.  Thank you.  I appreciate  it.  Why are  you doing  this?  What  that?  51  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't  know what  that is. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  I don't  have the  money for  this.  Why  didn't  you give  me a  chance  to prove  anything?  That's  illegal.  It's not  illegal.  It's not  illegal,  dude.  I work  there.  How can  you do  that?  You  didn't  prove it  to me.  I just  drove off  with my  car.  I'm going  to call  my  lawyer  then.  Call  your  lawyer.  You  ridiculous.  It's  well.  Stupid  fucking  truck.  As of  right now,  it's  $92.  It's  not  $45 anymore.  No,  it's  $55.  I  will  go back  to 
[03:35:30]  work  and  I'll  have  $92  because  we're  off  property.  You  drove  because  you  spent  all  way.  I'm  going  to  get  my  lawyer  on  you  guys.  Get  the  lawyer.  Get your  lawyer,  dude.  Get your  lawyer.  Actually,  I'm  going to  start a  standby  fee so  it's  going to  be  even  more.  You're  making  this  illegal.  How  can  you  do  this?  Totally  legal,  dude.  I  work  there,  so  that's  ridiculous.  You  caught me  out of  my  money  when  I  work  there.  You  don't  work  there.  I  do.  Why  do you  think  that I  live  across 
[03:36:00]  the  street  there?  I  work  there  in  the  chiropractic  office.  I  take  files  and  do  reports  and  all  kinds  of  BS  on  clients.  Oh  my  God.  And  there  you  have  it.  Jeez,  just  fucking  shut  up.  Suck  it  up.  Why  didn't  the  tow  truck  driver  just  drive  away?  Because  he's  a  dick  too.  He  was  getting  a  out  of  it.  Yeah.  I'm  going to  add  a  little  more  money  on  that.  Crying  little  motherfucker.  Those  motherfuckers  are  nerds.  When  you  saw  the  camera  come  out  you  toughen  up  a  little  bit  and  realize  where  that  video
