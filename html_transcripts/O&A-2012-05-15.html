<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Anthony detailing a debilitating illness that kept him off the air for a week.  He described severe coughing fits, exhaustion, and hallucinations reminiscent of childhood illnesses (one involving a train passing through his bedroom followed by his father calling him a "faggot"). He was reluctant to seek immediate medical attention, eventually receiving a Z-Pak. The hosts speculated on the illness's nature, possibly whooping cough.  This segment also included discussions of Anthony's recent breakup and his controversial Twitter activity, including photos of a woman hiding in his closet and pigs in his pool.  The conversation meandered through Jim Henson's death, Anthony's need for a doctor's note to return to work,  and his viewing habits (including Third Reich footage and a Hitler documentary), culminating in complaints about loud music disturbing his neighbors and a recap of a New York Rangers hockey game.  Joe DeRosa was mentioned as a visitor during Anthony's illness.

The show then delved into a thorough, and often explicit, discussion of *Fifty Shades of Grey*. Opie and Anthony, along with callers (Laura, Megan, Jen, Marissa/Melissa, Cheryl, Jenny Hutt) and studio guests Sam, Kenny, and Bob Saget, read and critiqued explicit excerpts from the book, frequently using crude and sexually explicit language.  The poor quality of the writing was a recurring theme, alongside speculation on the book's popularity amongst women. Bob Saget’s surprise appearance shifted the conversation towards his career, experiences with Propecia, and various television shows.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on anecdotes about Patrice O’Neal, highlighting his intimidating presence and unique comedic style born from negativity. The hosts shared personal experiences: one discussing his upcoming wedding, the other his divorce and co-parenting.  The conversation returned to Bob Saget, covering his upcoming stand-up special, plans to sing the national anthem at a White Sox game (including jokes about a potential bad throw), Broadway experiences, and thoughts on the entertainment industry.  The hosts heavily criticized Billy Bob Thornton’s publicist for refusing to book him on the show.  Bob Saget’s scleroderma benefit and a video of Jimmy Norton looking at Jodie Sweetin's breasts were also briefly mentioned.  Billy Bob Thornton's pending arrival was noted, but he did not appear during this segment.

The next segment featured a discussion about a comedian's experience with an absent father, the podcasting boom, and allegations of sexual misconduct against John Travolta.  Bob Saget, again in studio, participated in the often vulgar discussion about the allegations, including details from an accuser (a cruise ship employee).  The conversation also included Bob Saget's stand-up career, anecdotes about his personal life, experiences with Ambien, bathroom stories, and encounters with fans.  Discussions included air travel, first-class versus coach, and a news story about a woman who lost a leg due to flesh-eating bacteria after a zipline accident, leading to humorous speculation about the guests' honeymoon plans.

The show concluded with a discussion stemming from the zipline accident story, quickly transitioning to a caller, Sam, discussing his upcoming unconventional wedding, where his father would officiate alongside a justice of the peace.  This spurred a sexually explicit conversation involving premarital sex, unprotected sex, and Sam's honeymoon plans, including a discussion on Connecticut's age of consent.  Bob Saget returned as a guest, participating in the raunchy banter before promoting his tour and departing. The segment ended with promotional material and the standard show outro.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Hi.  Anthony's back.  Oh boy. Sounds weird.  What sounds weird?  Me.  Anthony's back.  It's an effort to speak.  Really?  Like I can't just hear. Watch, watch.  Here's me just trying to speak normally.  So, how are you doing? 
[00:00:30]  Like it just gets all airy and you can't really talk.  So I have to like step up and talk.  You got to rework that voice.  Yeah, it sucks.  You got to do a radio voice.  If you do a radio voice, you should be all right.  Hey, how are you doing, everybody?  There you go.  Hey, everybody.  Moist.  You sound like, what's your name?  Brenda Vaccaro.  Yes.  Hi, I'm Brenda Vaccaro.  What did she refer to? Like tampons or something, wasn't it?  Maxi band.  Some douchey product. 
[00:01:00]  Some horrible thing women needed years ago.  Exactly.  That they figured out a workaround.  Maybe some kind of netting to keep everything in place.  Some kind of fucking hand with a belt and fucking clamps.  The fuck, man?  With that wacky vagina.  God doesn't like women.  No.  We all know that.  Only women bleed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That sounds, we should work with that.  That's a good one.  How are you feeling, brother man?  Well, you know, it's just so good to be back.  Yeah, right. 
[00:01:30]  Is it good to be back?  Actually, it is.  I was getting pretty fucking shack-wacky.  Kind of bored.  Yeah, you can only watch Third Reich footage for so long before, you know, there's nothing  really to watch.  But, yeah, last week was so bad.  I mean, it culminated in my fantastic call to this very program.  Which creeped everyone out, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  As soon as you hung up, we all looked at each other like, oh, let's just go home.  Put the fear at everybody.  Let's just go home.  Yeah. 
[00:02:00]  It was horrendous.  Terrible.  I say you're fake.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  That was an Academy Award winning performance.  Last week was the most sick I've been in my adult life.  Now, as a child, I do remember having certain illnesses where I hallucinated from fever and  whatnot.  What was worse as a child, though?  I remember having some flu when I was a kid.  Right.  Or it might have been like the mumps.  I don't even know what it was, but it was a pretty bad fever.  Right. 
[00:02:30]  And I remember waking up and I had to run into Mommy's room because there was a train driving  through my room.  A locomotive pulling a bunch of cars went right through my bedroom.  I heard it.  I saw it.  And I was, you know, delirious.  And then your dad called you a faggot.  Yeah, my dad then called me a faggot.  Because he said that's some kind of gay dream.  Of course.  A train going into a tunnel.  It went into a tunnel.  So you must want a dick in your ass.  Right.  You little queer.  Right. 
[00:03:00]  He called me.  In that case, he was actually right.  Yeah, yeah.  So like that, I remember as like a kid.  But I wasn't hallucinating, but I did have a pretty good fever.  What made this the worst?  I'd never felt like I was going to die.  Really?  Dude, there was a few points where I was like, wow, this could be it.  Wow.  I could.  And then Dr. Steve kept reminding me of Jim Henson, who was just going about his fucking 
[00:03:30]  life with his hand in puppets and fucking wound up dying of pneumonia or some shit.  Right.  Because he didn't get medical attention when he had a respiratory infection.  Oh, he didn't have AIDS.  I thought Henson had AIDS.  No, man.  He should still be around.  He fucking had.  He should have went to the doctor.  Got a cold.  Right.  Motherfucker got a cold and died.  Right.  And Dr. Steve's like, well, remember, you know.  Yeah.  Jim Henson.  Why not?  I'm like, fuck, man.  Like you need to hear that.  But did that make you go to the doctor?  Well, yeah.  Dr. Steve. 
[00:04:00]  Because you don't like that doctor shit.  No.  You must really like that doctor shit.  But I just like riding it out, you know?  Yeah.  It's like, all right, I don't feel good.  You're a guy.  That's what we do.  You just ride it out.  You just hope it doesn't get worse.  I know.  So I got one of those Z-Pak antibiotics.  Right.  Took that shit.  And after about three days of taking that, I started feeling better.  But I had like the fever and shit.  No, but you got to slow down.  You got to go backwards a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  So when you were feeling the sickness you've ever been and you were saying to yourself, this 
[00:04:30]  could be it.  What were you feeling that made you think all this shit?  It's...  Lack of sleep?  Yeah.  Fever?  What?  Lacking?  Yes.  All this.  Really?  And a cough that sucked the life out of you.  It was exhausting to cough so much.  So what were you doing?  Like sleeping for five, ten minutes at a time?  If that.  It was...  I was staying up for periods of 24 hours where I would lay there just going, I want to sleep. 
[00:05:00]  I just want to sleep.  Oh, my God.  That would drive me nuts.  And then I was...  So would you doze off in between coughs at least a little bit?  Yeah, yeah.  And then I'd wake up, look at the clock, realize I was sleeping for maybe 15 minutes.  What kind of...  What kind of...  What kind of...  You got to explain the coughing.  The coughing, it's this picture like in your windpipe, you have like a thing stuck to the  side of it just going, frrrt, frrrt, when you breathe in and out.  It's like a tickle? 
[00:05:30]  So it's like, frrrt, frrrt, and it's tickling and making you...  But tickling way lower than usual?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can't go, er, erm, and get rid of it.  Oh, my God.  And then the coughing, to get it out, you cough every bit of air out of your lungs.  Right.  And now when you try to breathe in, you go, and it flaps that like frrrt again and tickles.  So now you can't even get a breath.  You go, er, er, er, er, er, just trying to breathe.  So you got to calm yourself down to the point where you got to go and breathe in so slowly, 
[00:06:00]  but you need air so bad that you want to, you want to gasp, but you got to breathe in  slow so you don't get that tickle.  And that's like your entire life.  It's all-consuming.  But what, every minute?  Yeah, 30 seconds sometimes.  Every 30 seconds.  Yeah, I was just down in cough medicine, and...  What's the longest you went without coughing?  Oh, man, sometimes after a good dose of cough medicine, I'd go maybe 10 minutes, and it 
[00:06:30]  was like cold.  Even the cough medicine couldn't stop?  No, it was just there, ever-present.  What are they recommending for you?  Do they have any, like, industrial cough medicine?  Uh, Kevorkian's machine.  Terrible.  Sounds like euthanasia.  Sounds like they can't recommend anything for this one.  No, it really was...  There's nothing...  Terrible.  There was nothing you could take that made it just slightly better?  The cough medicine, I guess.  I guess maybe there was, like, an inhaler or something. 
[00:07:00]  Like Dr. Steve was saying, there are certain things you could take that would keep that...  And I was just like, I just want to lay here and die.  Right, right, right.  Just leave me alone.  Oh, my God.  I completely...  By day three, I lost my will to live.  I just lay there going, I don't care.  Whatever.  That's so sad.  Wow.  That's so sad.  Well, you're starting to think, you know what?  Death isn't a bad thing.  It's like, you just start thinking, you know, it's a phase.  It's not a bad choice.  We all move on. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  Oh, my God.  I think a lot of people can relate to that.  Oh, it was terrible.  Usually it's when we get the stupid flu, not something like the whooping cough, but...  Well, you know what?  Now, the doctor was saying technically he doesn't think it was whooping cough.  Really?  Yeah.  Because he said I still would have, like, the really bad cough.  I don't know.  And he said after the antibiotics that I wouldn't be contagious anymore anyway.  Right.  So, you know, that's all good. 
[00:08:00]  I just wanted Sam to get it.  That's all I cared about.  Maybe...  I know.  Did you have strep throat?  No.  Strep throat's brutal.  No, I didn't have any...  Especially if you let it go before you get the antibiotics in there.  It started before Cleveland.  I had the cold and shit and a little bit of cough, and I rested up, and then I was fine  for the Cleveland trip.  Went to Cleveland, hopefully spread around my fucking virus to all the people in Cleveland,  and then when I came back, this hit me. 
[00:08:30]  Like, fucking ridiculous.  Well, it sounds like it was the whooping cough, but he's saying it wasn't the whooping cough,  or maybe not, so what else could it have been?  It's like a horrible upper respiratory infection.  Yeah.  Well, I see you got your doctor's notes so you could be here.  Dude.  I was going to come in yesterday.  I know.  I fucking wrote everyone an email.  It would have been nice.  I'm like, I'm here.  We ended up talking about Megan.  We ended up talking about flowers that look like pussies. 
[00:09:00]  Ooh.  We did survive.  Yeah.  Although I got pictures all day long of flowers that look like vaginas.  I appreciate that.  But yeah, they wanted a doctor's note.  I was going to, and then at 11 o'clock at night, before the show, hours before the show,  I get an email from Gary saying, well, you know, stay home.  We need a note from the doctor saying that you're not contagious.  I don't blame them for wanting a note, especially if it might have been whooping cough, but it's  always like how they do things. 
[00:09:30]  I know.  Last minute.  It's so terrible.  It's last minute.  That's what just always drives me nuts about this place.  They could have told you last week.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  There was plenty of time to tell me.  And then I was...  I had to tell these guys when you were out with, at that, in the beginning, you were convinced  it was whooping cough.  I'm like, I had to tell these guys, are you planning on maybe disinfecting the place?  Maybe just, you know, give it a little scrub down?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  That's a good idea.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Like, are they on top of anything? 
[00:10:00]  No.  So you got your doctor's note.  It says...  That doctor's note is ridiculous.  Date May 14th, 2012.  To whom it may concern, this is to certify that Anthony Comia was seen in my office on 5  14-12 for upper respiratory.  I advised him, her, to return to work school on 5-14-2012 with no restrictions.  And when I read that part, with no restrictions, I told Ant, that means, you know, full speed 
[00:10:30]  ahead with racism, sir.  I have a doctor's note that says I could say anything.  No restrictions.  You can't get in trouble today.  The doctor said I could say horrible, offensive things.  No restrictions.  I think the lack of sleep, how you're describing this, that's what would have drove me insane.  It was everything.  It was the lack of sleep.  It was the exhaustion that the coughing caused.  It was physically exhausting to cough that much. 
[00:11:00]  Did you take just nice, warm baths?  No.  You're not a bath guy.  I was writhing around in my infected bed, just laying in my own fucking sick and throwing  tissues around.  I got to the point where I wasn't even trying to put the tissues anywhere.  They were piled up next to me in the bed, a pile of tissues, a mountain of tissues.  Because what was I going to do?  I kept getting up and putting them in the garbage.  So your nose was running pretty good? 
[00:11:30]  Holy shit.  Before I got the afrin, it was just completely clogged.  So I'm trying to breathe through my mouth and coughing and my nose was clogged.  Oh my God.  And then that afrin is a fucking miracle work.  But then you've got to wean yourself off.  How long are you on it for?  Oh, I'm never stopping.  It's wonderful.  No, I got plenty of doctor's advice from Twitter.  These fucking know-it-all assholes.  I was like, they're just concerned.  I just write this.  I go, boy, afrin's great.  I have a cold.  Right.  But it cleared my nose out. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  Dude, a friend of mine, shut the fuck.  Just shut the fuck.  They're worried about you.  They're just showing concern.  I understand.  I stopped using it when my nose stopped being clogged.  And it's great.  It's highly addicting.  Now, you know, I got a little stuffy nose, but I blow it with a tissue and it's fine.  But I know if you sit there for a month with afrin squeezing up your nose, there's going  to be a problem.  If you go a week to keep, to be able to breathe when you have a cold, you're not going to fucking  be addicted to it.  Did you feel very just dried out? 
[00:12:30]  I wish.  It just neutralized.  No, I mean with just the cough.  Was it a dry cough?  A dry hacking cough.  And then you get those episodes.  I guess it happened maybe totally three times where you cough so bad that as you're coughing,  you go, oh my God, I'm going to puke.  Like you feel nauseous for that split second.  Then you go, all right, I got to stop coughing.  Or I'm going to throw up.  Holy shit.  You're describing whooping cough because we all Googled the shit out of that.  Yeah.  It's fucking crazy.  Everybody was Googling the shit out of that. 
[00:13:00]  Even people that we weren't in contact with were getting booster shots and shit.  Oh, I know.  It really, I think I really got people.  I think we just made America a little healthier for you.  Yeah, I got people going to the fucking doctor and getting the shots.  Right.  It was just horrible.  I was pretty much Twitter dark for two days.  I couldn't even, like I didn't give a shit about anything.  I was just like fucking watching TV and movies, catching up on shows. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  That was like it.  That was my whole life.  I did not give a shit about anything.  That sucks.  I was trying to think what else to ask you about this.  It was fucked.  And that was like.  Was mommy concerned?  And I couldn't even talk to any of them.  I couldn't talk.  Like Eatman called me at one point.  Anthony.  Oh, what's up?  How are you doing?  And I was like.  I was like.  I couldn't fucking talk on the phone. 
[00:14:00]  And that didn't stop him, I'm sure.  Oh, God.  He probably didn't even notice.  Or did he notice?  Who knows?  Oh, my God.  It's just terrible.  Yeah.  Yeah, so I muddled through that.  It started last Saturday.  Like a week ago.  And I was having some people over the house.  And DeRosa was one of them.  The lovely and talented Joe DeRosa.  And he wound up staying. 
[00:14:30]  And I woke up the next morning.  So sick.  Couldn't talk.  Just DeRosa outside the door knocking on my bedroom door.  Hey.  Can I get in bed with you?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, body heat.  I was just.  I feel lonely.  Hey, feel better, man.  Yeah, cool.  Oh, really?  One of those.  Yeah.  It was just like everyone get the fuck out.  How did he not get sick?  I don't know.  He was there.  How did no one get sick?  There were people at my house.  And none of these people are sick? 
[00:15:00]  Nope.  I was on a plane next to you.  I was so fucking paranoid, dude.  We flew together.  I was scared.  Well, you were sick, though.  Oh, yeah.  I did get sick.  You were definitely sick.  I forgot.  You just weren't as sick as he was.  And you took the Z-Pak, right?  I forgot, everybody.  You were sick, remember?  Fuck yeah.  I forgot about that.  Oh, man.  From the day you're out, Jimmy comes in here.  Horrible.  He could barely talk himself, and he had a one hour sleep.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  The show is falling apart.  Oh, Jimmy.  Z-Pak.  The wheels are falling off. 
[00:15:30]  It did help a lot, though.  Did you think it was the partying at first?  You just had a hangover that Saturday?  No.  You would know the difference, right?  You would know the difference, right?  No.  During Saturday, the course of Saturday, my voice went away.  I had that burning coming out of my penis.  I had a burning in my throat and upper chest when I coughed.  It felt like someone was stabbing me.  Maybe you had bronchitis.  I don't know. 
[00:16:00]  Like a bad case of bronchitis.  I don't fucking know.  Were you coughing way before Cleveland, just a little bit here and there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pre-Cleveland, I was coughing pretty good.  Yeah.  If you remember, even during the show, I stopped hitting the cough button.  Right.  If you listen to shows from like two weeks ago, you'll hear me coughing into the mic.  Maybe it was something like that.  Because if you had whooping cough, you'd be still fucking howling right now.  Probably, yeah.  They say it's like up to six weeks or something?  Well, when I wake up in the morning, I start coughing.  Like right before we went on the air here, I had a great little coughing fit. 
[00:16:30]  So, you know, you sleep, you wake up, and it kind of, everything that's settled there  overnight has got to work this way loose.  You notice how you talk?  I'm kind of leaning to my left.  Yeah.  No, I'm really not contagious anymore.  Look at Sam's face.  He's very concerned.  Ruined the wedding, right?  Are you very concerned?  My throat got sore again.  My throat keeps getting sore when I come into the studio and we talk about this.  Oh, no.  It's been a long haul.  Are you going to be reading your own vows to direct your own vows? 
[00:17:00]  He made his up.  Oh.  We almost had a bit.  Oh.  It was sort of working.  I was helping him out with vows.  With his vows?  Yeah.  But you've got to tell us one vow.  What's one vow?  Yeah.  Well, I haven't written any vows.  I just wrote notes.  What?  What are your notes?  Yeah.  You didn't tell us any notes?  Jess, how about you just have, like, I don't know, there's a book of vows out there.  Just pick one.  We pick some nonsense that seemed like it makes sense.  No, no.  Just pick some nonsense. 
[00:17:30]  We're writing real vows.  Real vows?  Yeah.  Like, like what?  You don't want us laughing during the vows, right?  Oh, come now.  You can laugh during the vows if you want.  You're going to turn and go, Jess.  Jess.  I don't know.  You are.  And then, like.  This is real pretty.  Yeah.  If you cry during your vows, I'll fucking throw my shoe at you.  Oh, God.  Ugh.  How embarrassing.  You think she will?  She might.  But I won't.  She's going to fucking realize where she is. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Break down and cry.  You're going to panic.  Marrying a wrestling fan.  I promise don't use fish sticks and be a child.  Yeah.  And to like you a lot forever.  Sam, have you ever cried?  In my life?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  I've cried before.  Over what?  A wrestling match that didn't go your way?  No.  Had to be.  I never cried watching wrestling.  WrestleMania, right?  When did you cry last?  Except out of joy when Macho Man got married.  Oh, yeah.  What was the last time you cried and why?  The last time? 
[00:18:30]  I cried at Patrice's funeral.  Well, faggot.  Yeah.  Why?  Did you really cry there?  Yeah, but that was the first time in like probably 10 years.  Who made you cry?  Rich Voss' speech?  Oh, my God.  But yeah, that was the first time in like 10 years.  What got you, though?  What moment at that thing?  I always get, seeing his coffin wheel by. 
[00:19:00]  All right.  We can move on.  Yes.  I mean.  What a great article.  You tried to find a moment in the wake that's miserable.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Give me one moment.  Yeah.  Yeah, the article was amazing.  That article was great.  It was really good.  From Andrea, who seems to be a perfectionist.  She's great.  Holy fuck.  It's a seven-page article on Patrice.  Oh, Adrian.  Adrian, yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Right, Adrian.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe I fucked that up.  Adrian, seven-page article.  We're all tweeting it.  I'm sure it's on our Facebook page by now. 
[00:19:30]  It really sums them up very well.  She fucking listened and took her time and interviewed a lot of people.  She nailed it.  It's funny.  She regretted not talking to him.  She never got to really sit down with him.  Really?  I'm sure if she did, she wouldn't.  Yeah.  If she sat down with him, she would have regretted actually doing it.  I kind of wish she was more just a myth.  There were some very good quotes in there about white guilt.  It was great.  It was really good.  She's a great writer, huh?  Yeah, she's really good. 
[00:20:00]  Goddamn.  So, it's back from my sick.  I was watching Vos' documentary last night, so I haven't seen it yet.  I'm not finished with it yet.  But it was cool to watch it and not see myself in it at all.  But it's good, though.  I've actually really enjoyed it.  Did you film for that?  Yeah, I was here with you guys.  But I do like it very much.  It's funny.  No, I know you were here with us.  That shit's just setting up stuff.  They filmed at the studio, which was nice.  Did I film separately? 
[00:20:30]  No.  Oh, why not?  They didn't ask me to.  Wow, that's a dick move.  Ouch.  That's a dick move.  Yeah.  You think it's a dick move, right?  Not a dick move, no.  I don't think it was done to be a dick.  I bet Rich wanted you in.  He said no, right?  I don't know.  Yeah, there's something going on there.  But Patrice, I saw Patrice's footage.  Oh.  And some of the lines he had.  It was like, oh.  Yeah.  Fuck.  I recognized his shot.  It was in his apartment where his fish tank is.  I was like, ah, I know where that is. 
[00:21:00]  It was fine, though.  All right.  Thanks, Sam, for bringing that up.  All right.  What else from your days off?  Anything?  Oh, man.  Let's see.  You catch up on pop culture?  Well, yeah.  After I realized I might want to live, I started watching some shows.  But three days in, you were like, holy fuck.  I couldn't do anything.  Did you almost go to the hospital?  Yeah, yeah.  I started thinking.  Like, there was about, I guess, last Monday, Tuesday, like around there, Monday, Tuesday, 
[00:21:30]  Wednesday, I was alone at the house, just completely fucking alone.  And I'm laying there thinking, someone's going to come in here and just find me dead.  Oh, God.  Like with mucus pouring out of my mouth.  Would you set up some hilarious scene, at least, for the person?  Oh, like pose myself?  Fucking naked on my knees, on my elbows.  So when they walk in the door, they just see my asshole. 
[00:22:00]  I'd go legs behind you like you were trying to blow yourself.  That would have been good, too.  Yeah.  No, so there were a couple times I was thinking, like, maybe I should fucking, like, I feel  like feverish, and I'd take my temperature, and I'm like, okay, this is like 102, shit  like that.  And I'd feel my, like, head and chest and stuff and be like, wow, I'm fucking, like, pretty  were you taking aspirin for that?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, I'd take the aspirin.  I was on a schedule of just like, okay, cough medicine, aspirin, fucking shot of Afrin, and, 
[00:22:30]  uh, like, uh, day quill, night quill, shit like that, depending on the day or night.  What about the booze?  No, no, I had nothing from, like, that Saturday, uh, Saturday night, uh, up until, geez, maybe  Yesterday.  Yesterday.  Hell, yesterday, the, the wine made an appearance.  I had, like, fucking a nice glassy of wine.  That was good. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, jeez.  Is there any, is there any withdrawals from not drinking for a week?  Nah.  Unless, I wasn't, unless I wasn't sick, unless I had, I wasn't sick at all.  And that was just withdrawals.  I felt like the flu.  Wow, you know, imagine that.  Some people say that's what happens when you withdraw from alcohol.  So maybe, technically, if you had a few beers in there, you wouldn't have been that sick.  Maybe I'd have felt better.  I couldn't even think of drinking.  Really?  Or having any bit of fun.  Right. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Fucking.  Uh, Brandon wants in.  Uh, Brandon in Boston.  Brandon.  Yeah, Ant.  Um, I was curious about the pigs in the pool, the infamous Twitter picture.  Because that was just horrible.  Oh, yeah.  Sure it was.  Let me see your jacuzzi.  All right, look.  They're not all winners, okay?  I gotta be honest with you.  Sometimes I go for quantity, not quality.  But, uh...  What about the creepy closet picture, too? 
[00:24:00]  That was pretty creepy.  There were a couple of good ones in there, believe me.  And, uh...  Oh, the creepy closet picture?  That's actually the girl from the closet.  That was literally the girl from the closet from the Jill Nicolini, uh...  Debacle.  Era.  Uh, she's down from Canada for a while and staying at the house.  And, uh...  She's with our friend, uh, April.  And they're...  They're just...  They're the biggest stoners I've ever seen in my fucking life.  Can I say that, Anthony... 
[00:24:30]  I had never really noticed that she smoked that much pot, because I didn't, you know...  Wow.  I was over there on Saturday, and Ann said, I've never seen anybody smoke this much pot.  And as I'm leaving, they came.  I said hello briefly on the way out.  And the first thing they did was fucking light a joint.  I'm like, wow, he was right.  From Canada.  Oh, my God, he was right.  They love their pot.  It's amazing.  The pot's really strong now.  I don't fucking know.  So how do they function?  Like, I don't touch it, I don't fucking smoke it, it would put me right to sleep. 
[00:25:00]  But, uh, wow.  They just constantly smoke pot.  And it could function.  That's what amazes me.  Yes.  That's tolerance, right?  Yeah.  Build up that tolerance for it.  Amazing.  But, uh, yeah, there was a picture of, um, her in the closet.  She was just peeking out of the closet.  All right, the one all the way to the left does look like she should be putting my towels in the dryer.  Who is the one on the left?  I don't know. 
[00:25:30]  I don't know.  Some of these people just come by.  They're friends of friends.  I don't know how it works, okay?  When are you going to put webcams up all over the place?  I know, I should.  Just go live, man.  I really should.  Go live.  I was zooming in with a security camera, um, over the weekend.  It's pretty funny.  Do you have controls, uh, from your bed?  Uh, yeah, well, I could get it on my iPhone.  How great is that?  An iPad.  From your sick bed, you could check out what's going on in your jersey? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, what's going on all around my house.  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  That's awesome.  Gotta be able to see what's going on.  Hey, what's going on?  What's going on?  Yeah, that's the creepy fucking picture.  Looks like a ghost.  But she's squatting down in the closet, peeking out, so it looks like she's three feet tall.  Oh, is that her?  People are like, why is there a child in your closet?  Yeah.  I hate it.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  You gotta explain that one.  Wow, that is kind of like the ring or something.  That's a cool photo, man. 
[00:26:30]  It is really cool.  Can you Instagram that?  Yeah, it looks haunted.  I gotta get with Instagram.  They did some cool fucking...  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  You're not Instagramming.  I am, but I...  I kind of have fun with it.  I just like Twitter, but everything...  You can do Instagram, and it just goes to Twitter, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They make it easy.  And then you can do all the filters?  Yeah, yeah, the filters.  Oh, God.  I could dial a picture up if I want to.  It's wonderful.  I try not to use too many filters.  I don't mind occasionally.  Sometimes...  I try not to.  Sometimes it makes sense.  Sometimes it makes sense.  Like that it does.  I want it to look creepy.  Oh, no. 
[00:27:00]  That's a perfect use of a filter.  That's cool, man.  In general, just take the picture.  And then there was another one of the pool, I guess.  That's a cool photo, Anthony.  Can you try it?  Yeah, isn't that really fucking cool?  Oh, it's...  That's really, really fucking...  ...my hallway.  She's just peering out a little.  Her eye looks evil.  That's a great shot.  Like, once in a while, you see someone on Instagram.  It's like everything from her peeking to the door to the color, the bluish color on the  right.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the grainy look to it.  Yeah, it was...  You should blow that up and have that frame.  That's a really cool shot, dude. 
[00:27:30]  It is a creepy one.  But that way, we thought it would be funny to kind of reenact the whole, hey, look who's  in the closet thing.  That's really hilarious.  Looks like, welcome to Coast City or something.  And the ex is all mad, of course, that she's over the house.  Are you talking about the ex?  Well, yeah.  Everyone on Twitter knows.  What?  I just have girls over the house and I'm still in a relationship?  No.  It doesn't happen that way.  But why is she mad?  I don't know.  I really don't know the reason why it's so angry to have that girl over the house. 
[00:28:00]  I guess because she was, you know, the one with...  I was cheating on Jill McElhinney with.  I don't know.  I love it, though.  It's like, you know, any time a girl's mad at another girl, they go, oh, you've got the  body of a 10-year-old boy.  It's like, dude, don't you understand?  Guys love girls with the body of a 10-year-old boy.  It's not an insult.  Oh, she... 
[00:28:30]  That Twitter thing back and forth, I was like, oh, no.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't air my dirty fucking laundry on Twitter.  Yeah.  But, you know, when you break up from a relationship, apparently that's what happens now.  People start giving little jabs on Twitter and you're like, really?  Are we going to do this?  And I...  Oddly enough, I kind of take the high road every so often.  So I try to, you know, keep it to a minimum.  But what are you going to do? 
[00:29:00]  It's Twitter.  We live in 2012.  Everyone knows everyone's fucking business.  So, yeah, there you go.  You haven't talked about it on the air, but...  Nah, nah.  Back to single Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Talk about exhausting.  Jesus Christ.  It really is crazy.  It's hard, right?  Oh, my God.  Especially when I'm sick.  I'm just like, ah, I'm sick.  I want to have fun.  I want to have a party and shit.  Were you worried that the whole summer would be shot? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, because when you hear about this whooping cough thing, you hear you're going to be  coughing for six to eight weeks.  Right.  That's the fucking summer.  That sure is.  I don't want to be in the jacuzzi fucking hacking.  It scares people.  We don't want you in the jacuzzi hacking.  I was in the jacuzzi and the fucking aunt was just dipping his feet.  He wouldn't get in because he didn't want to...  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  Yeah.  I was like, don't get in.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't want you getting sick.  I know.  No, I was sitting on the edge of the jacuzzi.  What was that look? 
[00:30:00]  I was like, like...  What was that look?  I was like, I was like grandpa on the side of the jacuzzi.  Nothing.  As all the kids were in the jacuzzi, I couldn't go in, so I had to sit all nice.  I had to sit nice.  But Jimmy was there, and that was good.  I liked that Jimmy came over.  I always get uncomfortable because Anthony plays his music so loud, and I'm always like,  you've got to turn it down.  You're going to bother the neighbors.  Yes, Jimmy's the turn it down guy, but it was 2.30 in the morning.  I can't believe...  And fucking Alice in Chains is blasting.  I can't believe how loud he plays at some... 
[00:30:30]  And then Anthony goes, well, no, no, it's fine because the speakers are aimed this way.  If you stand by that fence, it's like you can't even hear it.  Did you go there to check it out for yourself?  I went to the bathroom, and on the way back, I'm like, you know what?  I stopped by the fence, real loud by the fence.  And your theory might be wrong.  Yeah.  Do the neighbors ever knock on your door?  They're petrified.  What's going on in your house?  Of everything.  They're petrified that I'm not Jewish.  Right.  They're petrified at my Catholicism.  Right.  They're petrified that every sign that I have around my house that the alarm company put up is just covered in NRA stickers. 
[00:31:00]  Right.  They're petrified that I have a black Escalade and I'm Italian.  Right.  And they're petrified that I check my mail wearing a gun.  And also you leave at an odd hour.  I leave at an odd hour.  In your Escalade.  I come home at odd hours.  Right.  They don't know what the hell is going on with my company.  They gave up with you.  They gave up on you, right?  They used to try to get to know you a little bit. 
[00:31:30]  A little bit.  I remember that in the beginning.  And I noticed from the street when I open up my curtains and my slider in my bedroom, you could absolutely see the TV in my bedroom.  Right.  So they could see everything I'm watching.  And I was watching a documentary called Swastika the other day.  Oh, my God.  There's no real commentary to it.  It's just footage taken of Hitler hanging out at his little chateau, his chalet. 
[00:32:00]  And then it progressively gets worse and worse into what happened leading up to World War II.  And then you're coughing, so they think you're doubled over laughing.  They just see the silhouette of Anthony coughing like he's fucking watching something about Mary.  Oh, that's the original picture without the filter.  Oh, the filter made that fucking...  Yeah, yeah.  There's just giant...  That's nice, too, though.  There's just giant swastikas on your TV. 
[00:32:30]  There were giant swastikas.  Unbelievable.  Like, speeches, fucking just...  And then I noticed, oh, my God, you know, you could really see that from the street.  But I just...  My neighbors really don't know what to make of me.  But they don't knock on the door.  Do they have forced sale signs on their lawns yet?  And I think because the property, the value of houses went down so much that they can't move.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  I really put them between the old rock and a hard place.  And you really just cranked the music at 2.30 in the morning?  Oh, dude, it was so uncomfortable because he goes on and he puts it... 
[00:33:00]  You think they got, like, soundproof windows at this point?  I did turn it down after Jimmy said he...  He did turn it down, but I'm like, this is too loud.  I don't want to be the buzzkill here.  But this is way too loud, this music.  Jimmy.  I just get nervous.  I don't know why.  I know.  I feel bad.  Like, well...  I don't want him to be nervous at my house.  I get very nervous.  He must have been farting a lot.  That's hilarious.  Yeah, he was nervous.  Yeah, the houses are a little too close together to have music blaring at 2.30. 
[00:33:30]  The best was him saying the speakers are aimed this way.  By the fence, you can't even hear it.  And apparently you can.  I just decided to take a little detour to the fence on the way back.  I was expecting nice, peaceful silence, but I was...  I was sitting there and Jimmy just walks right up and he goes,  Andy, by the way, I can hear it.  Yeah, loud.  It's very loud by the fence.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  Oh, he did do that yesterday.  A fucking traffic was snarled by our place yesterday.  They wouldn't let us make a left on 66th.  And I'm like, is Obama in town? 
[00:34:00]  It turns out he did the view.  Yeah.  He taped it, I guess.  Yeah, it's going to air today.  I was trying to know what it was.  They were quizzing him about pop culture.  Because that's fun.  They were like, what?  What kind of questions?  They were like, well, what Kardashian was married for a total of like,  what was it, two weeks or whatever the fuck?  And he knew it was Kim.  Yeah, whatever it was.  I would have gotten an A on that question.  And he's like, Kim Kardashian.  And they were all like, oh, the president.  No.  Kim's a shit. 
[00:34:30]  People are out of work.  Cares.  Yeah, they like to do that little twist.  They certainly do.  They like to do the twist now that he's the first gay president.  He had a dinner.  There was a dinner for him.  Ricky Martin threw it like, it was like 5,000 a ticket.  Big hot dogs and sausage.  Just everything.  The buns would have ketchup only on one side.  And it was 15,000 for a plate, for a dinner with a photo. 
[00:35:00]  With a photo.  I would have done that.  15 grand.  You would have done that?  For a photo with the president?  I got my fucking Bill Clinton picture for free.  Easy.  He did that with George Bush, the older Bush.  Really?  He paid a bunch of money to go to one of the presidential things and got a picture.  No, you just need to know Suffolk County cops.  Oh, you have to be in the right place at the right time.  Oh, right, right.  You're a Clinton pick.  Well, I can't even fucking display because the stupid fucking X is in it. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, shit.  I've been trying to figure out how to do it.  I'll tell you how to do it.  I've been trying, man.  People have chopped her out.  They try to center it.  It just looks stupid.  Just zoom in on it.  It's you and the president.  Who cares if she's in it?  I know.  I just want me and fucking Clinton.  Zoom in on it.  Chop her out.  And you'll be obviously have chopped someone out.  But just zoom in on the outside.  That's the problem.  It's obvious that someone's chopped out.  And I'm like, I just want my Clinton picture so I can display that. 
[00:36:00]  That's cool.  Hey, look, at least you didn't get it with her in between you and Clinton.  At least you didn't do that.  You know what you do?  Put a drop in a bird right over her face and put a little motion blur like at the last minute it swooped in.  Nice.  And you don't see her face.  Doesn't fuck the picture up.  Or I could just write waste of time on her forehead.  You could do that.  Got a couple of those.  We'll put Obama's picture there if it looks like this is free of you.  Right.  I just want to fucking put that in my house. 
[00:36:30]  I don't know why you don't.  Just chop her out.  I mean, the fans have been great.  They've taken the picture.  They've tried to do things.  All you do is zoom and shop.  If it doesn't look perfect, so what?  You didn't plan on it.  That's true.  You're fucking walking behind a store.  And the next thing you have a picture with the ex-president of the United States.  That was a biggie.  So take what you got.  That is a biggie.  Zoom in on it.  And I can't even display it.  You can, though.  No, I mean, properly.  Yeah, you zoom in on it.  I know I can display it. 
[00:37:00]  Zoom in on it and fucking chop it.  Cut it and put it in the frame so he's, like, right at the edge of the frame.  I tried all that.  It just looks dumb.  That's got to look really bad.  It looks horrible.  Who framed this?  Jeez, that sucks.  I don't know.  I'll figure it out someday.  Welcome back to Anthony.  We just put, like, a really big border on one side.  Like an eighth of an inch here and four inches here.  It's horrible framing.  You know, that would be funny, though.  Something like that would work.  Yeah.  The gloves are back in their proper place, by the way, Jimmy.  No. 
[00:37:30]  Speaking of my memorabilia, Jimmy came over for the kid party.  Oh, right.  The one where E-Rock was with his shoes all over your shirt.  What a piece of shit.  Yeah, you don't give a fuck.  You think so?  Dude, I saw the picture.  It's like, oh, here's E-Rock respecting the furniture.  You're at the edge of the couch.  No.  You were not even close.  Dude, it was sneakers that you're walking around New York City streets in up on his fucking  ottoman.  Granted, that part of the couch is almost like a mini bed or something. 
[00:38:00]  But most people, you know, at least take their shoes off when they do that.  You have to.  You don't just pop your fucking sneaks up on that.  It's crazy.  Jimmy almost had a heart attack because my nephew.  Look at that.  Oh, that's almost near the edge.  Really?  Look at the way his heel is digging into the cushion.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The left foot, which is stretched all the way out, is still six to eight inches from the  edge.  And the other one, which just felt like folding under you.  It's right there.  It's easily two feet from the edge.  Get to see a little family photograph in the background, too. 
[00:38:30]  Oh.  There's a little Easter egg in that picture.  Lack of respect.  If you zoom in on the Hughes calendar that I got for the holiday.  Oh.  Someone did point out, they're like, ew, does he have a calendar of himself?  No, it's a family calendar of some nice family pictures that Jimmy captured in the E-Rock  fucking up my couch photo.  It was an accident.  I actually went to that angle to avoid getting your family and your father-in-law. 
[00:39:00]  It's all good.  But my nephew had the boxing gloves that Jimmy got signed for me.  The Sugar Ray Leonard and the Bernard Hopkins.  You know, two champions.  Sure.  And my nephew, who's about seven or eight now, maybe eight, seven, I don't know, seven,  I guess, had them on and was pretty much ready to start boxing people.  Oh.  And Jimmy kind of was panicking.  Yeah, yeah.  He couldn't handle seeing them there.  The collector's items.  He finally got a hold of me like, just buy some boxing gloves and have them around your 
[00:39:30]  house for the little tyke.  Well, when I had the Christmas party, he had the boxing gloves on, too, and he was boxing  people.  Oh, boy.  And I remember that, but I forgot to put him away.  He just loves those boxing gloves.  All right.  Oh, man.  You want to take a break?  Sure.  Where's our grub?  Drop out the X, insert cardboard Jimmy.  Hey, what the fuck is that?  What is this?  What? 
[00:40:00]  It's a game?  Yeah.  What game?  Saints Row.  Where's my early games?  Hey, buddy.  I don't play.  I'll play there.  I don't know.  I'll give it a whirl, but I'm looking for, I got Xbox.  What kind of game is that?  I don't do violent video games.  They just cause, they make violence.  Yeah, I don't do that.  I don't really appreciate.  No, I don't do that.  Violent video games.  No, no, no.  You kill people.  What?  You kill people.  Where'd you get this?  They sent them.  Oh, they sent them?  Because they know we're gamers?  There's a few good games coming out. 
[00:40:30]  I think I'm going to be playing some fucking games.  Nice.  I like the Rangers shirt.  Go Rangers, right?  I'm all about the Rangers.  Yeah, what happened with that?  I don't know.  I thought of watching the game.  I go, okay.  I guess I go pick a team.  It was kind of a boring game.  It certainly was.  What was the final?  Three zip?  I went to bed.  Yeah.  Rangers won over the Devils.  I am picking the Devils.  I have to.  I was trying to watch America.  People were very angry at you for picking the Devils. 
[00:41:00]  I know.  I haven't picked a team in this playoffs, by the way.  I picked the Flyers.  I picked the Capitals.  I painted my face.  Yeah, I know.  Is that the reason you're watching?  No, but actually, Travis,  why are you watching hockey all of a sudden?  Well, Travis said the game was on, right?  I'm assuming it has to involve some new girl.  No, no, no.  That likes hockey.  Not at all.  Why are you watching hockey all of a sudden?  Yeah, why?  Well, it was Travis said,  oh, the game is on.  Right.  And I'm like, you know what?  See, it is.  I'm not watching anything. 
[00:41:30]  I'm doing a girl.  Yeah.  Travis, I wish I could do the voice.  I know.  Go ahead, try it.  Oh, no.  Tactic.  Hold on a minute.  How about pop culture?  I don't know.  We're going to find out.  All right.  I have some questions.  Fire away.  Let's see what you've been reading.  Number one,  which Kardashian was married for only 72 days?  That would be Kim.  Very good.  Okay.  Red, white, and you.  Because I was a ball player. 
[00:42:00]  I know the ball player.  That's how I know from watching basketball.  Okay, now this one you may not know.  I'm hoping that you don't, as a matter of fact.  Get ready.  What's the controversial sex book that's on millions of women's bedside tables?  He doesn't know.  I don't know that.  Good.  Okay, next.  Anal fisting for beginners.  Oh, I'll get out when I get home.  Mark.  He's great.  That was actually the improv there.  I'll ask Michelle when I get home.  That was all right.  That was great.  Yeah, that is good. 
[00:42:30]  Anal fisting.  If he gets something.  Oh, just totally.  Oh, yeah.  How to make a white pussy cream.  What?  You'd have to vote for that guy.  Oh, yeah.  Put him over.  Just guess the worst.  The worst possible book.  We're going to put peanut butter so a dog licks it?  Oh, what?  Yeah.  What is that sex book that the women have?  Shades of Grey.  Shades of Grey.  Oh, I wouldn't know that.  What the fuck is that about?  Yeah, I don't know that.  That's a big thing right now. 
[00:43:00]  Shades of Grey.  Pussy.  Get on mic there.  What is it?  Yeah, it's a Grateful Dead song.  Yeah.  It's like a, I think it's a novel, but it's very sexual in nature.  It's erotic.  And a lot of people, a lot of women, a lot of women, you know what kind of women are  reading that?  The same one that read those fucking romance novels with goddamn, it doesn't have the cover  with fucking a Fabio looking guy on it?  No, it's not like, it's like a, it's a big deal.  Oh, it's fucking, it's a big book.  Fifty Shades of Grey. 
[00:43:30]  You know who just hosts?  It smells?  Yeah.  Your mic stinks.  Mars is in here.  What is he, disinfect all that shit?  Yeah.  Tells it about.  Is it yours?  Oh.  Oh, fuck.  Ew.  Don't smell it.  Is that your breath, you think, or someone else's?  I think it's a combination.  Yeah.  Everyone.  That's some Lysol?  Yeah, whatever Mars does.  Let me see that.  I'll do a little bit of mine.  I guess Mars is valuable around here.  Ah.  Wow.  Sorry.  So what is this about?  Well, I was going to say.  Give me some of that shit. 
[00:44:00]  Our old pal Jenny Hutt hosted a Shades of Grey special.  Where's that bitch?  We're all spraying our mics.  Why would she do that?  I don't know.  Who is that bitch?  Oh.  So what are we going to do with this book?  What is it?  I don't know.  It's like, uh...  It's like...  You're not describing it well.  Huh?  Like, there's lots of sexual...  But it's not hardcore, right?  And then his embrace was, uh, so, uh... 
[00:44:30]  It was around me, and I felt warmed up.  It's not like fucking ass-fucking, right?  No, it's something for the ladies.  And they like the stories.  They like the romance.  He took her.  He took her in the garden with a glass of vino in his hand.  Why does it stick in and out?  Exactly.  But this is like...  This is the new big book.  You know, this gets me going on something I wanted to bring up.  I brought it up on Twitter last night.  I guess we'll do it after we eat a little bit.  Okay.  But it's this trend that's going on of these fucking hot chicks on Twitter trying to act 
[00:45:00]  like guys.  And it's...  I'm not buying it.  Oh, do you mean the way they're talking like they're trying to...  Yes.  Yeah.  And they talk about fucking and their pussies and cock and everything.  And meanwhile, in real life, they're still going to be the fucking cunts that they are.  But, uh, but on Twitter, it's like all about, hey, hey, hey, fill my cunt.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Really?  We need some examples of that. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, believe me.  We'll get some examples.  Yeah, let's find some of those.  Please.  Yeah.  Every chick had that book on the beach.  Everyone knows about this book.  Can we have...  This is the new Twilight.  Can we have Roland read some transcripts from it?  New Twilight.  This is like the new Twilight, new Hunger Games.  Now it's Fifty Shades of Grey.  God, how does shit like this happen?  Can we read some excerpts?  Yeah.  Find some sexy parts.  There was one book I read that was really sexual, and I'm trying to remember the name of it.  It was like really fucking graphic in a good way. 
[00:46:00]  And it was like, supposedly it was like classic literature, too.  Classic.  No, I'm serious.  So it wasn't like porn, and it wasn't this fucking romance shit.  I will come up with the name.  And we got to read some transcripts from that.  It's a whole series of books.  What?  What that one is?  Oh, yeah.  Fifty Shades of Grey.  All right.  So the author's just like fucking freaking out like, I can't believe this.  I'm rich.  Chapter one.  Oh, my God.  This looks like nonsense. 
[00:46:30]  Long-winded shit.  I scowl with frustration at myself in the mirror.  I'm like, damn, my hair.  It just won't behave.  And damn, Catherine Kavar for being ill and subjecting me to this ordeal.  At least you're reading it sexy.  Yeah.  Poor fest.  I should be studying for my final exams.  Where's the in and out? 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Where's the sexy part?  You should be putting some sexiness to it the way you read it.  You're not giving it a sexy flair.  There's nothing going on yet.  There is.  That's true.  You have to have a little bit of lead up.  A little bit of build up to the sexy thing.  You should have a sexy lilt.  Yeah.  A sexy lilt.  I don't feel it.  The CEO is in the first, second paragraph.  The CEO of Grey Enterprises.  Ooh.  Ooh, a powerful man.  Oh.  Oh, a powerful man.  Grey Enterprises.  They actually make exploding butt plugs. 
[00:47:30]  And they ship them dispensers and rubber duty.  Grey Enterprises.  I couldn't believe it.  He pulled his turgid cock out.  And there was a rubber duty wrapper.  So he said, suck the rubber shit off my dick.  How far into the book before we get into some of that fucking?  I don't know.  I read it.  Well, you're looking at it right now.  Grey Enterprises.  They make AIDS medication.  It's the unsexiest company ever.  Yes.  So he took his cocktail.  Oof. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, that looks boring.  Grey Enterprises.  Yeah.  He came in with his bulging trousers.  All the girls are loving it.  Mm-mm.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  No, who doesn't like a man from Grey Enterprises?  Exactly.  It's about an older man in bondage?  Oh, yes.  Of course it is.  There is bondage.  His wife reads them.  It's all SNL.  Oh, great.  It's about bondage.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure it really is crap.  You're all wrong about it.  Wait, we got Laura in Pennsylvania.  Hello, Laura.  Oh, let's hear Laura.  Better sex.  Watch.  These phones are lit.  Oh, boy. 
[00:48:30]  They don't give a fuck about your sickness.  They care about this dumb book.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  What's going on, Laura?  Actually, it's Maura.  Whatever.  Oh, how about Lessa?  It's hardcore mommy porn.  It's like S&M.  And quite frankly, the author sucks.  She's not a good writer.  But she has a terrible sex life at home because obviously she wants to get fucked by this guy.  By Mr. Gray.  What kind of bondage in the book?  Because we're not reading this shit.  It starts like around chapter 10, but it's... 
[00:49:00]  Chapter 10?  Who has time to wait?  Holy shit.  Shouldn't that be up front?  Do the backstory later.  Exactly, right?  I mean, if I want some porn, I want to see it up front.  Is it graphic?  Look, man, if you've got a bondage in your book, it's got to be chapter one, paragraph  one, get that all out of the way, and then go and then have some dream sequence what led  to it.  Let you know where you're at.  For the people that want to read further.  Is it graphic?  It's very, very graphic, but... 
[00:49:30]  Like what?  For women?  Well, why can't Sam find the graphic part?  Because I'm just reading the first 10 pages.  I don't have the book in front of me.  Get chapter 10.  They don't just have it for free online.  Nobody's going to buy the book if that were the case.  Oh, that's true.  So what, they give you a sample of the boring stuff?  Yeah.  Great.  Laura, you got the book?  I do have the book.  I don't have it with you right now, though.  Ah, man.  We want some girls reading some of the best books in the book.  What about Megan from D.C.?  She read all of them.  They're terrible, so maybe she's got a little more insight.  Well, I want a girl to read some of the bondage from the book for us. 
[00:50:00]  Exactly.  So get the stupid book off your nightstand and start reading.  Please.  Thank you, Laura.  More, whatever the fuck.  Megan, a regular to the show.  What's up?  Oh, you guys, I don't have it with me in the car.  I would read it to you.  Oh, boy.  That would be good.  Give me an example of what type of S&M kind of...  Well, he has this, like, playroom that he brings his...  His bitches?  His submissives into.  Yeah.  The whole thing is so ridiculous.  She's the worst writer in history, too. 
[00:50:30]  And it doesn't...  It's not even...  It doesn't even turn into an S&M thing, because she's too afraid to, like, really do any of  the S&M stuff.  She just kind of dabbles in it with him a little bit.  And then, immediately, they fall madly, passionately in love and...  Oh, Christ.  Jesus Christ.  That sounds nice.  What the fuck?  That sounds really nice.  Is there a lot of love and romance and stuff in it?  Yeah.  I like that.  I think it's going to be all subversive, and it's not at all. 
[00:51:00]  I mean, he just...  So, why are you bitches reading this shit?  God, these women...  I read it because I don't want to be left out.  But what?  Left out of what?  Fair enough.  We have some quotes that Rowland can read.  Oh.  Also, it was so bad, I just felt like I had to read it so I could complain about it.  All right.  Well, what did you find here, Sam?  Several quotes that it would definitely, depending on the voice you want it read in, be effective.  Ah, okay.  I see.  So, these are...  It's the 15 best slash worst.  Oh, these are actual quotes from the book?  Yes.  Oh, God. 
[00:51:30]  How many books have they sold?  A lot.  A lot.  Millions?  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  Ew!  Oh, God, what a horrible line.  These are awful.  I don't know if it's something you want the sex man to do.  This is drunk sexting fucking lines right here.  I think that one's mine.  I'll get every pussy out there sopping.  Now, let's get...  I'd say we get, like, Kenny or somebody.  Kenny?  Yeah.  We need a straightforward reading.  Is Kenny around?  Yeah, he's on his way in. 
[00:52:00]  Kenny will read.  Kenny's read this shit.  Kenny's not sexy.  I think Chip should read it.  Shut up.  Oh, shit.  Kenny, read this shit.  So, what is this, Sam?  These are just...  Are we going to start with number one?  Yeah, I mean, it's not like a countdown.  It's just...  No?  No.  These are the best little, what, quotes?  Yeah, these are all quotes from Fifty Shades of Grey.  That people are talking about.  All right.  I'd like to bite that lip, he whispered darkly. 
[00:52:30]  Jeez.  Dark.  I'm a quivering, moist mess, and he hasn't even touched me.  I squirm in my seat and meet his dark glare.  Ugh.  That stinks.  It's not even fucking...  She squirmed in her seat.  Oh, great.  Squirmed in her seat.  Don't squirm in your seat.  Why does she take the cock?  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, you bitches like some stupid shit.  This one's good.  All right, go ahead, Kenny.  The muscles inside the deepest, darkest part of me clench in the most delicious fashion.  Wait, wait, wait.  The muscle...  What's she talking about?  Like her Kegel, her pussy Kegel.  Right, right.  Deep pussy muscles.  Just say my pussy's fucking, like, twitching and shit.  Yeah, she got a nice cunt.  Jesus, Kenny.  Oh, okay, this looks a little better. 
[00:53:30]  All right, it does?  Go ahead.  Suck me, baby.  His thumb presses on my tongue, and my mouth closes around him, sucking wildly.  Holy fuck.  This is wrong.  But, holy hell, is it erotic.  His thumb...  I don't like the fact that...  Wait, that wasn't a cock?  No.  Holy hell is terrible.  Holy hell.  Jesus Christ.  Fucking Batman was blowing her. 
[00:54:00]  That was terrible, because it was...  The thumb is being sucked.  Well, that could be very erotic or something.  Nah, you know what?  But it doesn't go any further, I'm sure.  They like to do that in movies.  That grosses me out, though, finger-sucking.  I used to think if they opened a doorknob, or was he scratching his belly button with  his thumb?  Right.  Very erotic in movies, though.  No.  Because they want to think it might be the penis.  Right.  So they do that trick in movies.  Sam still sucks his thumb.  Yeah.  You do, Sam? 
[00:54:30]  No.  Long-thumbed idiot.  You got another one?  Tenny's joke.  Yes.  Go ahead.  Oh, my.  I didn't know it would feel like this.  Didn't know it could feel as good as this.  My thoughts are scattering.  There's only one sensation.  Only him.  Only me.  Oh, please, I stiffen. 
[00:55:00]  This sucks.  Horrible writing.  It's terrible.  All right.  Go with five.  Christian follows with two sharp thrusts.  With a knife, I hope.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  And he freezes, pouring himself into me as he finds his release.  Pouring himself into me.  That's jizz.  Is it?  Definitely.  They're making jizz all romantic and shit.  Yeah.  That's what happened there.  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  All right.  I had no idea giving pleasure could be such a turn-on.  Watching him writhe saintly with...  Subtly.  Subtly.  I don't know.  I don't have my glasses.  Oh.  It is a weird font.  With carnal lounging...  Longing.  Longing.  My inner goodness...  Goddess.  All right.  Where's your reading glasses?  Ew! 
[00:56:00]  I got a phone.  Oh, look at this line.  Is doing the menagerie with some salsa moves.  Sam, read it, please.  Marengue.  He wrote, I had no idea giving pleasure could be such a turn-on.  Right.  Watching him writhe subtly with carnal longing.  My inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves.  That stinks.  That's what bitches want.  You fucking bitches are reading this shit.  That's what bitches want.  That's terrible. 
[00:56:30]  It's a huge book.  The women are fucking gobbling the shot.  What about that one?  His lips are parted.  He's waiting.  Coiled to strike.  Desire, acute, liquid, and smoldering combust deeply in my belly.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  I think it's nonsense.  I think it's alien.  He punched her in the fucking stomach.  Your stomach pile is smoldering in her belly after getting a good gut suck. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, go ahead.  Are we almost done with these?  How many we got?  We're up to eight of 15.  Great.  All right.  We picked up the rhythm up, down, up, down, over, and over, and it feels so good.  Between my panting breaths, the deep down brimming fullness, the vehemoth sensation pulsing through me that's building quickly, I watch him, our eyes locked, and I see wonder there, wonder at me. 
[00:57:30]  This is fucked.  He's wondering if she'll get the fuck out as soon as he blows his load.  He's looking at me and at the door and back at me and at the door as he cleans his cock off with a sock. 
[00:58:00]  Our eyes lock as the door unlocks.  He has his cum on my shoe.  He laughs.  I feel a foot in my back.  My inner stomach curls around his fist.  This is terrible.  It's terrible.  Go to the next one.  My insides practically contort with potent, needy, liquid desire.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:58:30]  I grip his throbbing pull.  He pulls back.  There's a doody on it.  A doody.  He wipes it on my curtain.  He tells me to lick it clean.  I gag.  He walks out the door.  This is just horrendous.  I'm turgidly humiliated.  There's a doody on my curtain that belongs to me.  Oh, shit.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  All right.  What's that one? 
[00:59:00]  His expression pulls at that dark part of me, buried in the depths of my belly.  My libido, woken and tamed by him, but even now, insatiable.  What's his expression?  That's that face Sam makes.  That's probably something clever he says that just gets her.  Oh, an expression.  Yeah.  His expression pulls at me.  That's the expression Sam makes in every picture he poses with a fan. 
[00:59:30]  What's his expression?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Good visual, Kenny.  That was great.  Great visual.  I don't know if they really got that one out there.  What's the next one?  My inner godness is beside herself.  Goddess.  Godness?  Goddess.  Is beside herself.  Hopping from foot to foot.  Anticipation hangs heavy over my head like a dark tropical storm cloud. 
[01:00:00]  Butterflies flood my belly as well as a darker, carnal, captivating ache as I try to imagine  what he will do to me.  As he brings the spade shovel down on my head, my last thought is, boy, did I fuck up taking  this guy home.  I quit ever thinking what he'll do to me.  I'm so happy I met him at Green River.  That's funny.  He sodomizes me with leaves on my face.  I hear the digging of a grave. 
[01:00:30]  Whoops-a-daisy.  Me make a mistake.  Oops-a-daisy.  I'm getting so many tweets, people.  Moms are reading this shit all over the place.  Why?  That's fucking stupid.  It's huge.  Yeah.  Guys just think way differently, huh?  Oh, my God.  It's so obvious.  Sam's got a boner.  I don't have a boner.  Yes, you do.  Sam, are you getting a rod because of this?  Jab it.  Jab it with your lips. 
[01:01:00]  Poke it.  Pinch your helmet.  Poke it.  Kenny, poke it with your index finger.  Poke it.  Poke it with your nose.  Pinch your helmet.  Poke it.  Come on.  Oh, he pinched his helmet.  What?  I can't use it.  All right.  We're almost done.  What's this one?  That's the bottom line.  Because Stone Cold said so.  I want to be with him.  My inner goddess sighs with relief.  I reach the conclusion that she rarely uses her brain to think, but another vital part 
[01:01:30]  of her anatomy.  And at the moment, it's a rather exposed part.  This is supposed to be like porno?  It's because all these women have their inner goddess.  They all think they have this crazy, like, oh, yes, the banality of my normal life, but  my inner goddess is aching to get out.  Is it?  Inner goddess.  Stop.  Yuck.  Inner goddess. 
[01:02:00]  Sit on the bowl for a while.  Apparently, my inner goddess gives toothy head because he went ooch and backed up and  lost his erection as my fucking, as my incisor clipped his helmet.  Oh, clumsy me.  A waft of my dirty vag walked right his way up to his schnozola.  Yes.  I feel his finger entering my rectum.  I then feel it rubbing under my nose.  Oh, drat.  He got me. 
[01:02:30]  The filthiest of Sanchez's.  All right, Kenny.  We're almost done.  Please.  You've really got a taste for this, haven't you, Miss Roberts?  You're becoming insatiable, he murmurs.  I've only got a taste for you, I whisper.  Who talks like that?  No one.  I've only got a taste for you.  And Roberts is not the character's last name.  Miss Steele.  Miss Steele.  Oh, ooh.  She can't even, like, figure out good character names. 
[01:03:00]  This is awful.  Miss Steele.  Terribly written.  Go ahead, Kenny.  I close my eyes, feeling the buildup.  That's what I feel in the toilet.  Shut your eyes.  It's building up.  Exactly.  As a torpedo of yesterday's deliciousness opens my anus from the inside and fires at the bottom of the ball.  This cigar-shaped treat fell into the ball, splashing water on my anus, cooling the fire. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, what would it be?  Gliding silently like a cigar-shaped UFO.  It pokes its ugly head above the water, tickles my buttock cheek.  Pushing me higher and higher to the castle in the air.  Castle in the air?  Shut up.  And finally, the last one. 
[01:04:00]  Look at me, he breathes, and I stare up into his smoldering gray glaze.  His smoldering brown eye as he tells me to eat his ass.  It smells of onions.  He's pointing a gun at me.  I concede.  Jimmy's got a knack for this.  Yeah, you really do.  He commands me to eat his ass.  It reminds me of a cold Reuben.  I do as instructed.  He farts. 
[01:04:30]  He and his friends laugh.  Oh, fuck.  That's funny.  Goddamn, Jimmy.  It is his Dom glaze.  Cold, hard, sexy as hell.  Seven shades of sin in one enticing love.  Oh, Christ.  And his writers stinks.  It's like glaze.  Yes.  Is she a very rich woman from these books?  That's horrendous.  Very, very rich. 
[01:05:00]  That's a disgrace.  We got Jen in Tampa.  Jen, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Horrible, horrible writing, but you have to find the part where she says that he sticks her thumb up her sex.  She calls her vag, her sex.  I hate when they call it that.  Just call it what it really is.  Upper sex.  Fucking.  Yeah.  You know what.  You know what.  Why do they have to talk like that?  They're trying.  Because they don't want to use the same words.  He's a horrible writer.  They don't want to use the same words over and over, so they're trying to find different terms. 
[01:05:30]  Right.  But this is just corny.  Oh, no, no, no.  She uses the same words over and over.  Like, geez.  This is corny romance novel language.  Yes.  Horrible.  Yes.  But I'm on the third book, so.  He puts his thumb into my sex.  He yells, hey, Cunningham, and then sticks it in my mouth and says, would you eat this?  He asks me if I douche with sardine oil.  The dog enters my sex with a little enticing from some peanut butter. 
[01:06:00]  Yes.  He angrily bites my shoulder as the man films, as the CEO of Grey Enterprises.  Grey Enterprises, a bestiality fucking film company.  Why didn't he buy oven mitts and duct tape?  The dewclaws are hurting my shoulder blades.  It's actually Greyhound Enterprises.  It's all dog fucking videos.  Okay, so you have to get to about chapter 10. 
[01:06:30]  My sex smells like kettle ration.  Hey, lady, you realize we're never going to get to chapter 10, right?  Please.  She goes, you have to get to chapter 10.  We're not reading these things.  It's nonsense.  It's stupid.  But you have to find the part where she calls her vag her sex.  Yeah.  That's very common in these type of things.  All right.  He puts his thumb in my sex.  I make a mental note.  Declaw him.  Okay, guys.  Happy birthday.  All right.  Marissa, what's up, Marissa? 
[01:07:00]  It's Melissa.  I'm a one.  How are you?  You're going to explain why women like this shit.  All right.  The reason why the writing is atrocious and it's terrible, but it reminds busy moms to fuck.  That is the only reason why these books are popular because, you know, you forget you're  doing shit at night, you're tired, and you start to read this book, it reminds you that  there's a guy next to you that you can fuck.  That's nothing like the dumb book she's reading. 
[01:07:30]  Exactly.  Oh, God.  He just got home from the garage where he works.  Yeah.  His greasy fingernails enter my sex and give me an infection.  Yeah.  He does a chip voice.  He comes in my hair.  His bag smells like brake fluid.  Yeah.  Real sexy.  Yeah.  His breath reeks of coffee and cigarettes.  He has plaque in his teeth.  He comes quickly.  Is that the reality? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, of course it is.  That is the real deal right there.  Holy shit.  All right, we got...  He works on a shit-sucking truck.  He forgets to wash his hands.  He cups my mouth unsexually.  I pass out.  He kicks his shitty shoes off and he hits the sheet and makes a skid mark.  His feet smell like cadavers.  He has psoriasis all over his back.  I grip it angrily. 
[01:08:30]  He's driven 600 miles and has swamp ass.  He lowers his testicle into my mouth.  I suspect one is cancerous.  That's the dumb reality right there.  Oh, fuck it.  Let me say hi to a friend of the show, Jenny Hut. 
[01:09:00]  Jenny, what's up?  Oh, hi, guys.  You read this shit?  Well, I read it months ago before it became this huge.  Yeah, but, I mean, you're a thinking woman.  Don't you think it's stupid?  Yes, incredibly stupid, but I'll tell you what it is.  It's that women are reading this.  These are women who are not having a lot of sex or an adequate amount of sex.  And I think they're reading it and they're hoping that...  That's the pig that writes these books?  Oh, no, it isn't.  She's a big, fat pig. 
[01:09:30]  Guys, she's a working mother in the UK, and this is her midlife crisis, she says.  This is her fantasy to be adored, to be ravaged, to be taken control of.  She wants to be fucked.  And I think that that's part of the issue, is that women are feeling like men don't know  how to please them.  And Christian Grey just wants to please Anna over and over again so that she can...  Hold on, hold on.  I'm looking at this woman here that writes this book.  She has no fucking clue what any of that shit is like. 
[01:10:00]  That's why she writes so bad.  She doesn't know what it's like to have a guy look in her eyes with fucking adoration.  Because she's not writing from experience.  No.  She's a big fatty and a moomoo.  She's horrible looking.  I think this is her fantasy.  Maybe she would get cocked if she lost 100 pounds.  How about you start there?  If she was writing honestly, she would say, he pants and grunts.  And as he comes, he says, I'm so happy I went pigging.  Can you imagine what her ass smells like?  That's awful. 
[01:10:30]  She can't keep that shit clean.  It smells like mutton.  Her ass smells like the ground in Game of Thrones.  What?  We're having fun here.  Listen, if you're having sex with somebody, and as the girl is coming, she's saying, oh,  here comes my inner goddess.  How would you react to that?  We probably would punch her in the face.  I would think so.  I would just not, it wouldn't turn me on.  That would make us angry.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  By the way, it's not what I would do.  Would you write a hot lesbian scene about a young working woman who angrily mounts 
[01:11:00]  the face of a spoiled woman whose mother is a cooking guru and grinds her vagina on the  mouth of the spoiled cooking guru daughter?  Listen, I think that sounds like a beautiful fairy tale, but that's not kind of erotica.  This just shows that we just don't understand each other, man.  No, no.  Because women are buying this book.  They're flipping out. 
[01:11:30]  There's three of them.  It's a trilogy, and it's a love story.  He lifted my belly fat up to expose the cheesy substance that grows under fat women's guns.  Guns.  We were kissing.  He came on my stomach staples.  Did you reach the one where he straps her into a harness?  No.  A sex swing or something?  No.  Yeah, it's a four-point harness with all the straps.  Then he hooks her up to a wagon, and she pulls it westward.  Exactly. 
[01:12:00]  He works for Budweiser.  Yes, he makes a wintry commercial with me as I pull the beer truck because she's fat  like a horse.  Exactly.  Clydesdale monster.  They're trying to make it look like she's wearing a sexy outfit on the red carpet.  Mia, she's dressed in a sleek, pale, pink, full-length chiffon gown.  She looks amazing.  She doesn't.  She doesn't look amazing.  She looks like the fucking instructor on Dance Moms.  She looks like Drapes.  She's a bit fat.  She's wearing Drapes.  I hate this woman. 
[01:12:30]  So basically you're saying that because she's unattractive, she can't be having sex?  Or she shouldn't be.  Yes, that's exactly what we're saying.  I'm saying she has no clue how to write about a guy looking at her with this physical attraction.  If she was writing to experience, she'd say he looks out the car window, he makes a  mooing sound.  He drives away laughing.  I met him in the bar.  He wanted to fuck my skinny friend.  I complained. 
[01:13:00]  I was tired.  We left.  No one got laid.  Bob, did you just describe a scenario?  Oh, man.  A lot of people have lived through.  It happens all the time.  She's the fucking wingman.  Right.  Just sitting there.  Pig.  Getting annoyed.  Cock-blocking cunt.  My friend is having sex.  I'm drowning my sorrows with potato chips.  What's that?  Why did I make that noise?  Let's get her an ice cream float.  I'm actually scrolling through the book right now.  What?  I'm scrolling through the book while we're on the show.  It's corrode, it's corrode. 
[01:13:30]  Do you know, suppose...  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Supposedly, chapter 10.  Of what book?  The first one, I guess.  Yeah.  Supposedly, if you could sit through nine chapters and get the 10th chapter, that's when  it gets good.  Good.  One chapter.  Hold on a sec.  I find that on a stupid Kindle.  Well, there are young girls reading this book, too, and I like young, but like, in their  20s.  Why?  Oh, I don't know why the young girls...  I guess they're saying, they're saying that they're using it as sort of shorthand to  say to men, this is what I want, but I don't really... 
[01:14:00]  What?  I don't...  Yeah, I don't want to be...  No!  I want to be fucked, not beaten.  Is that fair?  Whoa.  Even...  Even...  God, that just really turned me off.  Girls don't get it.  It's just...  I want to be fucked, not beaten.  I know.  Usually that could be a hot thing.  So, wait, wait.  Oh, here, here, here, here, here.  Hang on, hang on.  Yesterday...  Wait.  Hold on.  Yesterday, Opie was turned on by balloons on the ceiling, and today...  I saw that.  That's true.  Today, Jenny Hunt specifically says, I want to be fucked, and Opie goes, yuck. 
[01:14:30]  That's why I love that Sam fucking pipes in.  I like your observations.  Yeah.  Psychologically, I like where it's coming from.  Jenny doesn't do it for me.  I'll tell you that much.  I like her, though.  I do like you.  You know that.  We're not in that way.  All right, hold on a second.  Before you read...  Hold on.  Before you read from chapter 10, we got Cheryl in Ohio, another woman that's going to try  to explain why she reads this shit.  Ooh.  Go ahead, Cheryl.  Hey, guys. 
[01:15:00]  I don't read the books, but I've read about them.  Basically, the only reason why these books are popular is because the woman is able to  change the man.  It doesn't have anything to do with sex.  The book starts out, the guy is all dark and brooding and doesn't want to fall in love.  Oh, you're wrong.  She's wrong.  It's not just because she changes the man.  If it were just that she changes the man, there'd be no fucking in the book.  Oh.  Well, I'm...  She's only using the fucking as a tool to change and control the man.  Why is Jenny Hud reading these books?  She's... 
[01:15:30]  Jenny, why are you reading these books?  Well, I read them because everyone was reading them around me and they're like, you have to  read it.  You have to read it.  So I read the first one and I was like, okay, it's cute.  But then I read the other two because I'm such a...  Hey, I'll bet she...  I'll make sure he didn't die.  I'll bet she touched herself while she read it.  Did you touch herself?  She definitely did.  She fingered herself at least once.  Yeah.  Did you finger yourself?  What part of the book did you finger yourself?  Did you make yourself come?  And stick your thumb in your own asshole.  In your sex.  Did you grind your dog bones? 
[01:16:00]  In your dirty sex.  Do you want me to answer or you don't?  Not really.  We're just using you to get some lines out.  Yeah.  Way to understand how radio works, you fucking hole.  She's the worst.  She just keeps talking.  What?  Jerking off right now.  No.  The books didn't do it for me.  It's not that I wouldn't touch myself under appropriate circumstances where something was  turning me on, but I didn't find the books particularly erotic in that way.  Yes, she did. 
[01:16:30]  So did you find the chapter 10 that's supposedly really good?  No, but I have another place where he turns her over.  All right.  All right.  Let's hear her.  All right.  Let's hear your fucking little take on this.  And, you know, read it sexy like.  Yeah.  Give us a little sexy.  He smacks me across my behind with his hand.  He smacks me across the behind with his hand.  He hits a cluster of hemorrhoids from my pregnancy.  I yell, ouch, and jump off his lap. 
[01:17:00]  Okay.  Fuck.  He puts his leg between mine and holding my hips.  There's a mole that looks like a piece of tootie by my asshole.  Yeah.  He opens my ass cheeks.  I hear him gag.  I make a mental note to towel out real quick.  All right.  Let's listen to J.E.  He has such beautiful skin, Anastasia.  He breathes that as he bends down and kisses me along my spine, gentle feather-like kisses. 
[01:17:30]  At the same time, his hands moving around to my front, palming my breasts.  Wait, can you slow down for a second, J.E.?  Palming the breast.  Palming the breast that's remaining.  I want to put a visual to this.  The author is a huge, fat pig.  So what?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's bent all the way over, and you're slowly making your way down to her anus?  Same happening.  Get the fuck out of here.  No way he could be behind her, kissing her ass and touching her tits.  Logistically, this doesn't work. 
[01:18:00]  She's huge.  I stifled my mom.  We sit on the sofa.  A Hungry Hungry Hippo commercial comes on.  He elbows me.  He says, let's see it.  Okay, you guys will love this.  Do you want this?  All right.  He puts me on my stomach and says, let's play hide the salami pig.  He says, you have such a captivating, sexy ass, Anastasia.  What I'd like to do to it.  Which one?  The ass within the ass? 
[01:18:30]  You know, fat chicks have their big, fat ass,  and then right by their asshole, they have another, like, quato ass.  A mini ass.  It's like a mini ass, like quato ass pops out.  So what you should do is just squint, and then maybe the larger ass will disappear.  He says, you have such a sexy, captivating ass.  I say, that's my face.  He says, oh.  Someone says there's fisting in this book.  Oh, good.  Hopefully it's in her face.  Exactly.  I say, did you want those carrots? 
[01:19:00]  He says, don't overcook the steak.  It defeats his own purpose.  He punches me in the face.  Oh, someone caught you in a lie, Jenny Hutt.  Uh-oh.  Let me go to Tony in Texas.  He fed me apples on a flat hand.  Just the way I like it.  Tony, Texas, go.  Yeah, hey, earlier she said that she read these a long time ago before they even got popular,  but then right after this.  All my friends were reading it six months ago.  You're a fucking liar. 
[01:19:30]  It's true.  Yeah, you're lying.  Jenny just wants to be liked, so she knows everyone else is reading them, so she started  reading the books.  She just let that attractive voice do the talking for her.  Yeah, exactly.  Let's hear another line, Jenny.  We're starting with this.  Yeah, go ahead, Jenny.  Hot stuff.  Okay, so what?  You never disappoint, Miss Steele, he whispers, and I hear the wonder in his voice.  Hold tight.  This is going to be quick, baby.  You're so wet.  It's under her armpits.  The small of her back.  I've never seen a woman sweat here before.  She slips into a diabetic coma. 
[01:20:00]  I continue fucking her ass.  I turn the air conditioner up higher.  She still sweats.  I realize she's ill.  You think she sweats a lot?  Yeah, she really does.  She's a big fatty.  She's the worst.  Yes, I ejaculate all over her Spanx.  I look at her bunions popping out her Crocs. 
[01:20:30]  Anyway, I did a whole show about this the other day.  I think you guys know that.  On book radio?  It was on my show.  It was like a simulcast.  Who gives a fuck radio?  That shit.  The audio is on my website.  Hey, I follow you on Twitter, right?  Do you have a moat in front of your house?  Yes, several.  You do, right?  Several moats?  Multiple moats?  I saw you on a paddle board.  Supposedly that's exercise or something?  I do not have a moat. 
[01:21:00]  Well, you were in the water with some dude and you both were on paddle boards and you're  calling that exercise or something.  What?  Oh.  You've lost your mind.  I saw the picture.  What was that?  It's some kind of day two of my summer workout.  Oh, I have no idea.  Who knows what I was doing?  I don't know.  No.  You're on the top.  You're on the table.  You're on the table.  You're on the table.  You're on the table.  You're on the table.  That's the Jill Martin thing.  I tweeted to Jill Martin and she was on day two of a moat thing.  Are you sure?  I don't have a moat at my house.  I have a gate. 
[01:21:30]  When are you going to invite us over so we can check out the property?  Anytime you want to come.  As long as you'll be mean and nasty, you're welcome in my house.  I'm nice with the radio.  You know that.  I know.  I don't mind.  Let's get rid of the husband for the day so we can check out the big fucking property.  So she could be nude?  No.  I don't want to see her nude.  You're welcome to come.  You guys, you do have an open up.  She lost too much weight.  There's got to be some elephant shit going on there.  Oh, like sagging skin?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Fuck you.  I hate that.  I want to hear more novels. 
[01:22:00]  Do you have sagging skin because you lost too much weight?  I don't.  I'm very lucky.  I have very...  My stomach, I'd like...  The only problem I have is I'd like to get a tummy tuck one day.  Oh, God.  Do you think the breasts are not firm like they used to be?  Oh, man.  They're all right.  A little flat.  You know what I mean?  Feels like a broken Stretch Armstrong.  Yeah, exactly.  Listen, it could be far worse.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Guys, I know who I am.  Did you laugh so hard you farted?  Was that Jimmy?  He left so hard you farted? 
[01:22:30]  What?  Broken Stretch Armstrong.  Oh, Jimmy.  I want to hear more of your sexy novel.  Come on, sexy more.  Yeah, one more sexy.  Blurt it out.  Are you ready?  Okay.  He grabs my hips and positions himself, and I brace myself for his assault, but he reaches  over me and grabs my braid near the end and winds it around his wrist to my nape, holding  my head in place.  Very slowly, he eases into me, pulling my hair at the same time.  I stop short.  He flies over.  I've paralyzed him. 
[01:23:00]  Christopher Reeve will never be the same.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  He's just on her.  He holds her hair, and then he gets really mad.  He goes...  All right.  That's enough.  Have a great show, guys.  Bye, Jenny.  Well, thanks for helping us out with this book.  Thank you.  Seems like you really like it.  Yeah.  I do love all of you.  Goodbye.  Bye, Jenny.  All right, Jenny.  You didn't even give a plug for your show.  No one cares.  What's her website?  What's her Twitter?  She's nice.  I like Jenny. 
[01:23:30]  Justjenny.com is the website.  Justjenny.com.  It's got all the links.  Her Twitter should be still fat on the inside.  Oh.  She still has fat girl self-esteem, which is zero.  She doesn't do it for you at all?  What about you, Ann?  Actually, when she was a little chubby, she wasn't that bad.  She's cute.  She's cute.  I didn't mind the chubby version.  How old abroad is she?  As much.  I mean, she's a woman of a certain age.  Yeah, I hear you.  She's got a couple kids.  Oh, fuck that noise.  Any daughters?  She's got a young daughter, yeah.  She'd probably be really pissed if I fuck her daughter. 
[01:24:00]  Jesus.  How old is she?  I mean, young.  School.  Maybe 13.  Right.  Oh, okay.  That's not good.  Why don't we take a break?  I pay attention to all the proper laws of our land.  That's her right there.  What?  You can't barely pay attention to a law.  You either do it, you know?  That's a good way to live.  I'd love to fuck you.  Hold on.  Let me go to Google.  Let me go to my chart.  I thought I got handy.  Oh. 
[01:24:30]  All right.  All right.  Good old Jenny.  Yeah.  She's nice.  Just Jenny.com.  It's her website.  Yes.  What do you get on there?  Anything good?  She blogs and posts videos on a treadmill.  Her treadmill video.  What the fuck is that about?  Can we watch a treadmill video after the break, maybe?  And you can listen to the Shades at Fifty Shades of Grey fan forum book radio, Just Jenny's special. 
[01:25:00]  Wow.  Caution.  Adult content.  Oh, shit.  Oh, hey.  Very salty.  So this really is in our wheelhouse, huh?  Wheelhouse.  Is she finally explaining why Martha's stupid daughter hates her?  Oh, no.  She never...  Why won't she fucking come out with it finally?  She still says there's no one specific thing.  She's off the Martha Stewart channel.  It's time to talk.  Is the daughter still on the channel?  I think the daughter might be relaunching a show or something.  I'm not exactly sure. 
[01:25:30]  Why won't they just talk about what happened?  Maybe they just got to dislike each other.  Maybe there really was no one thing.  Jenny should talk.  Yeah.  I'd have a lot more respect for her.  Yeah.  Because some shit went down, man.  She was just trying to keep her job at one point.  Yeah, she was trying to save herself as far as the Martha Stewart channel goes.  But now she's off that channel.  It doesn't matter anymore.  Would it turn you on?  Come out with it.  If she was a little more stood up for herself, would it turn you on a little bit?  Yeah, because that Alexis is a...  Oh, yeah?  Oh, my God, yeah. 
[01:26:00]  Man.  I never met her.  You could tell.  I've never met her officially.  Yeah.  Fucking put it to her good.  Oh, yeah.  You would like that, right?  Sexy.  You would like that, right?  Yeah.  Put it to her good.  All right.  I'm going to pee myself.  All right.  I guess we'll take a break.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  The Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:26:30]  All right.  Oh, is this a getting topical thing?  It can be.  I was just putting it on because I thought Bob was coming in.  Bob who?  Mr. Saget.  Bob Saget is walking down the hall.  Our old friend.  We haven't seen him in a while.  Still old friend.  Yes.  Rathcon.  Yes.  Apparently, the con is going to be in the new Star Trek.  Really?  You know, the whole new gang. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, apparently it's a con storyline, which is kind of cool since they can do whatever they  want now.  They kind of altered the Star Trek timeline because of that time travel thing in the first  movie.  And now I think they're going to go with a con storyline, which is good.  Kirk Con always works well.  Hey, look who it is.  Bob Saget.  Looking younger.  Bob Saget looks really good.  What the fuck is going on?  Yeah.  What the fuck are you doing?  What are you doing?  I don't know.  Taking some vitamins?  Working out Pilates? 
[01:27:30]  Fuck, man.  Young girlfriend.  I don't fuck, man.  Is that your first question?  Fuck, man.  Oh, well, okay.  All right.  How are you guys doing?  I'm happy to see you.  We're kind of creeped out.  I'm happy to see you.  We're creeped out.  You look younger.  What do you do?  That's what somebody said.  You're getting work done in Hollywood?  No surgery.  No nothing.  No surgery.  I did take that Propecia that makes your hair grow more.  Does that shit work?  I think so.  Yeah, Propecia.  My pubes are like a fucking sprouter.  Yeah, but you do have a lot of hair. 
[01:28:00]  You grew it out a little bit.  It won't stop.  I need headphones to hold it down.  See?  How are you guys?  You guys.  Maybe we should do the Propecia up here, man.  Should?  That thing.  Been on that Propecia since they fucking moved some follicles.  Yeah, I'm thinking I might move follicles, and maybe I'll try the Propecia.  Your pubes growing fast, too.  Really?  Yeah.  And your ass hair.  I braided it.  Oh, jeez.  It's like Willie Nelson on it.  I sat on it.  I'm happy to see you guys.  It's been a while.  It's been a long time, man.  Whatever happened to that show you were on?  I liked it. 
[01:28:30]  That was years ago.  You liked that one and the one before.  That was the last time you were there?  No.  Last time you were in?  I was here because you were telling me you missed that show.  Oh, sorry.  No, I liked the show.  You were traveling around the country seeing weird shit.  Oh, that?  We didn't talk about that.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it was the last time I was there.  The Bigfoot and the Fiker Gang.  Yeah, that was the last time I was there.  I didn't come in for you to say I liked it.  That was canceled, too, because you liked the other one I came in.  Yeah.  It was canceled.  Which one?  One versus 100.  Yeah.  Oh, I love that show.  And then it...  I thought that's...  I really did like that show.  I know you did.  What happened with that show?  I don't know.  They still don't know it's over. 
[01:29:00]  Really?  Nobody told them.  They run it on the Game Show Network.  Oh, they do?  Do they give you a Friday time slot or something, which is a rough time place, right?  Yes.  Yeah, they fucked around with it.  They absolutely fucked around with that show, unfortunately.  It did well.  Is there a new host on the Game Show Network?  They had some lady, and then they got rid of it.  And then they run reruns of mine.  I only did 20 of them.  That's it?  Yep.  And then the Strange Days ones I liked a lot, because I get to do different cultures and  go see people.  You never got a second season for that? 
[01:29:30]  No.  We did seven of them.  They were really hard.  It took a year to do them.  Wow, a year for seven episodes.  We went to Ukraine, which that one didn't air.  I went to camp with small boys, which they would have closed our shit.  Why didn't Ukraine air?  I thought it was too edgy for A&E.  What?  We were helping guys get mail at a bride, so it was a lot of sketchy.  It was really funny.  Oh, a little fucking mafia shit.  It was a Ukrainian mafia thing.  Weird people.  Human trafficking. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, human trafficking.  The joke I said on the air was, the legal age of consent is yes.  And they just chose not to air it.  Yeah, they didn't want to air that, and then we did other ones.  But things are good.  I'm working on a lot of shit.  I'm doing the Fifty Shades of Grey musical.  I can't wait to see that.  I met her.  I co-hosted The View, which aired on Friday, and I sat with her, E.O. James, and she was  just talking.  Not much room on the couch after she sits. 
[01:30:30]  Well, we were in stools, which is convenient.  Oh, okay.  But there's no use, if you read the book and the contracts, there's no use of feces or urine.  And, you know, she doesn't like that.  If she's going to get tied up, the character gets tied up.  She doesn't.  He doesn't want to.  Not a rope.  We're going to use a butt plug.  It's going to be clean.  Right, right.  So it's nice.  That book sounds horrible.  I don't know.  It sounds like this phony kind of trying to be sexy.  Like what a housewife wants.  It is Lady Chatterley's Lover written for people today, I guess, but I never read Lady 
[01:31:00]  Chatterley's Lover.  Was she nice at least?  She was really nice and nervous, which made me all the more want to tire up.  That means she was sweating even more.  Was she passing gas?  Yeah.  All over my testicles.  I wanted her so bad.  After I read the book, it was just like, whoever wrote this, I got to do it.  I don't care what, man or woman, animal.  Bring that fat ass over here.  Big lathered up fatso slated over a fucking PC.  No one has to even say bring that fat ass over here because it's already there.  It's there. 
[01:31:30]  No matter where you hug her, it's right there.  Her pecking away with her hooves.  I'm really happy to see you guys.  I don't get out very much.  I was here when my daughter graduated.  I didn't, but she did.  She got graduated.  She done got graduated.  Get her graduation on.  From Barnard.  So she did that.  The president spoke at her.  Yeah, I like that.  It was good.  I'm glad it wasn't Clinton because it's an all-girls school.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That would be a little awkward.  Did you get to meet him?  I saw him from, you know, I saw him the whole time.  He's on my phone, but that big screen, you know, he was far away. 
[01:32:00]  You didn't get to meet him.  A big star like you.  Well, you know, I didn't go, hey, excuse me, I got to meet the president.  You should.  It just sounds sketchy.  Anything you say that ends with got to the president.  Got to and the president.  Yeah, yeah.  I got to fucking talk to him right now.  Where is he?  What are you talking about?  I spoke about how they can do anything they want.  Oh, that old guy.  After they pay off those loans.  Yeah, exactly.  And he'll go there with them.  He'll help them move forward.  Oh, that's good.  It was very inspiring. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, he was.  How long did he talk for?  About 45.  He had a real, he crushed at the end.  Yeah.  The last 60 seconds, you know, we would maybe hear a piano thing if somebody's really pissed  or the light would go on.  Yeah, today we're like the president.  Helicopter.  The helicopter's landing.  Wow, that's fucking cool.  So it's like your convoy's coming.  That's like the who at fucking Woodstock.  As he's finishing, the helicopter's landing?  As he's finishing, you hear it landing, and then he starts doing what he's supposed to do,  which is talk over the helicopter.  And that is why you, you know, I don't remember exactly. 
[01:33:00]  There he goes.  Thank you.  Good night.  Throws the mic down like Chris Rock.  And they played.  Motherfucker.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he literally just walked to the helicopter from there?  Yeah, he walked off the stage.  I don't know where they took him.  Wow.  You saw the helicopter take off with him?  No.  Because they had it tented, so you can't see nothing.  Yeah, I know.  I was once in a hotel with President Bush.  They had the whole thing locked down.  They actually lifted the hotel off the ground.  They might as well have.  They had tents set up.  They blocked all the hallways so you couldn't even take a peek at them as he was walking through the whole place. 
[01:33:30]  You had no idea where he was the entire time you were there.  That's their whole goal, keep it mysterious.  There's probably three George Bushes, and they just kept moving them around.  They rotate them around.  It's amazing.  Different limos.  You think Obama has a body double?  Of course.  You do, huh?  You mean for his R-rated movie work?  We're going to cut to his thighs now.  For his magic act, like the prestige.  It's a bloody table.  You always have somebody. 
[01:34:00]  Two guys.  When the helicopters, I heard, take off out of the White House, there's three of them.  And they do a really weird maneuver, so you technically don't know which one he's in.  But whenever they take off in the White House, there are three helicopters at every time.  It's like a multi-billion dollar three-card Monty.  They just kind of move it around.  Okay, which one's got the president?  Which one's got the president?  Well, I saw it come in.  I saw the helicopter come in to the White House.  When I was there with Kenny, we saw it was Marine One.  And when it lands, you literally can't see where it goes on the ground.  You can't see.  I watched it come in, and we could not see where it goes. 
[01:34:30]  There he is at Barnard.  What was that?  That was yesterday morning.  The author of Shut Up, Scott Browning, says no.  Larry Wingate is here live.  Why is he wearing the gown?  It just looks silly on him.  I think he looks pretty in a gown.  He shouldn't wear that.  You like Obama, Bob Saget?  I'm okay.  I like the human side of the way he speaks.  I can't help but be taken in by that.  He's a great maitre d' and teleprompter reader.  Yeah, he's a great teleprompter reader.  But he's passionate about something, which is the human, you know, what are you going 
[01:35:00]  to do?  It's what he reps, and what he comes up for is the human condition, and people that came  out of nothing.  And he was raised by a single mom, and he touts that.  But there's a lot of, there's 590 girls that were out on the world, and they all mentioned  you, Jim.  I would hope so.  Every one of them.  That's right.  Every one of them shaking a bottle of Valtrex.  A lot of Valtrex majors.  You could have had your way with, they were really excited.  You could have gone crazy.  You would have been like you at Candy Store with a bunch of 22-year-old girls. 
[01:35:30]  Not me, though.  I have no connection to presidential goodness.  I mean, just college.  College girls?  I don't do, please.  What?  This is not the look they go for.  Well, I disagree.  A funny guy, they don't care.  They don't think I'm funny.  They don't like my cynical, shitty humor.  They think Dane is, they like a certain humor.  They don't enjoy what I do.  Dane?  They like Dane?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, God, yeah.  Colleges love Dane, yeah.  They love Dane, yeah.  I don't know, though, Jimmy.  Sense of humor goes a long fucking way, man.  It does.  I hate to say this, but you have a cuteness in it. 
[01:36:00]  You know how I've always felt about it.  There's something impish and adorable about Jimmy's Norton.  Your eyes say yes.  They're welcome.  That's true.  They say yes.  They say yes a lot to him.  Just a blinking fucking creep on a fat neck.  Fucking blinking fat neck.  That should be the name.  That should be it on the top of my singles head.  Blinking fat neck.  Seeks booker.  You're so cute that you start twitching.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm really cute until I begin blinking a lot, making guttural sounds at my throat. 
[01:36:30]  He really, he had me until he started rubbing his crotch and grunting.  But your humanness, the way you are made, no one would know that you're blinking, you know, Tourette's-y kind of thing.  I think it is a mild Tourette's.  I think that women can enjoy that, but a lot of times they don't.  No, when you read something like that stupid book we were reading from the Grey fucking-  Fifty Shades of Grey.  Fifty Shades of Grey.  Grey's Sports Almanac, was it?  Yeah.  I said on the view I couldn't put it down because it was stuck to my hand. 
[01:37:00]  Did they like that one?  Yeah, they did.  One of them queefed.  I can't remember what that one.  How was it doing the view?  It was actually nice.  I enjoyed it.  That's weird because you're kind of dirty, man.  I am.  And they're fans of that.  It was Whoopi, who is kind of dirty herself, and Joy, who is kind of dirty herself.  And the other person was Sherry, who's not really dirty.  And just a dummy.  Well, Bob doesn't have to sit there and just fucking blurt out nasty words.  They just had me moving quick.  Eva Longoria was on, and you would like her.  She would like you. 
[01:37:30]  She wouldn't like me.  You could spittle and twitch and blink.  See, Jimmy, what the deal is, you read a book like that, and you see that, like,  girls thinking, it's not, you're thinking with the mind of a guy, and thinking like,  oh, they're going to look and go like, oh, I want a fucking guy that's ripped and all  this shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, read the book.  You didn't hear one thing about how funny the guy was, did you?  Oh, and that joke, as he blinked quickly at me.  Like fucking, yeah.  I love them as he blinked and spittled profanity. 
[01:38:00]  Like tweaked, like, what was it?  That fucking, from Battlestar Galactica, that fucking, bitty, bitty, bitty, bitty, bitty,  that fucking cheeky or tweaky.  That was Buck Rogers.  Oh, whatever it was, that shitty monster.  That's the book.  Yeah.  Fifty Shades of Jim.  His semi-flaccid erection, as he asked me to play with his nipples so he could achieve  a full one, but his jokes sure are good.  Where was that in the fucking movie?  Okay, that wasn't in there, but there's a certain...  Two hours of farting.  Like sensitivity. 
[01:38:30]  He cupped a gasser and opened it in my face.  I laughed at the irony.  But there's a sensitivity that's there that, like, you can tell if they weren't having  this fake fucking...  There's not.  You know, she might enjoy some humor.  I wrap my arms around his back.  I feel the small cyst in the middle.  I mentioned that it must be a fatty collection.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, you might be making a good point.  She has two other books she wrote, too.  She wrote this first one, and then she said...  No one cares.  She said, I got to read the other two because it's a love story. 
[01:39:00]  What was the touch?  What were the Fifty Shades of Grey?  What was the first one?  How I Escaped from the Circus?  I think it's the shadow of his penis on her cheek.  It's a love story.  You know, he just needs...  I think he was abused as a kid, so he wants to take it out on her.  The only way he could have sex is to be smacked around and pulled on.  You don't like that stuff, do you?  I don't mind that.  Handcuffs?  No, I'm not into being restrained a lot.  I don't mind if a girl is fucking...  Fucking prop comic, bitch.  No.  I don't want handcuffs. 
[01:39:30]  I don't want rope.  I want full nudity and just...  Flaming torches.  Fun.  I wouldn't mind my cock being tied a little bit, though.  They tie your cock sometimes.  Why would you want your cock tied?  Why do they do that?  Tied to what?  Like the key of the room so you don't...  Tie your cock?  No, you just tie it up and you'll look at it.  It's all tied up.  What, like a bow?  What do they use?  You mean to claim it?  It's like a piece of land?  Yeah.  Do they make it turn blue?  No, not that.  Purple?  Some guys probably like that, though.  Yeah, they like it to be constricted.  I don't want my cock tied up, do you?  No.  I don't want my cock tied. 
[01:40:00]  I want to tie-died.  That would be interesting.  I want to tie Cobb, where it just fucking says horrible things to black people for no  reason.  Your cock just talks and says that.  That's what she looks like?  She was fine.  She was a nice, nervous lady.  You're not at the view anymore.  It's okay.  You're not going to blow up your dick.  All right.  I fucked her.  Yeah, I fucking tuned her.  How is Barbara tied up my cock?  Was Barbara there?  No, she wasn't.  She was tied up at home.  Ah, yeah.  This broad's going to be a billionaire, though. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, she's going to be very wealthy.  She's going to be the next Harry Potter broad.  Harry Potbelly.  Did you do an Harry Potter?  Harry Puder.  Did you do the whole hour with him?  I did.  I walked in with a card, with a blue card, and I left without a card.  That's how long I stayed.  And what's her name was on that?  De Laurentiis, that chef.  She's kind of pretty.  I hate celebrity chef.  Oh, is she the one with the big fucking head?  Don't you?  I hate them.  She's got a big head.  You're very large.  She's got a...  I know this broad.  Yeah.  She's good to look at, but she's... 
[01:41:00]  I know this broad.  Her head is too big.  Well, she seemed...  She had a pez come out of her neck.  Yeah.  Somebody said that once.  I can't remember who it was.  She's got like a bobble head.  Jeff Martyr.  You know that name?  I do not.  Well, then I guess we could take that joke.  Yeah, I'll steal it.  Why not?  I haven't seen you guys since...  I didn't talk to you even through the whole Patrice thing.  Oh, right.  We were just talking about him this morning.  Yeah, what a track.  I just...  I think his poster's sitting out there, and I just...  Yeah, yeah.  I just loved him, so...  That's a great article that came out on... 
[01:41:30]  Yesterday.  Yesterday, too.  New York Magazine.  Seriously, it's seven pages, and you feel like you...  She nailed it.  Oh, yeah.  Described him perfectly.  Absolutely.  Talk about how close he was to breaking and something good happening.  Yeah.  All that shit.  All that good shit.  He should have been way more famous than he was.  Yeah.  How all the other comics just, you know, respected him, and he was able to just hang with anybody  and really shit on you well.  He was really funny at that.  Oh, man. 
[01:42:00]  And always asking you how come you're somewhere he's not, and then pick apart your credits.  I've seen your raggy-ass shit.  That's great, man.  I don't know why you're doing that shitty show.  So, anyone else, you'd be pissed off, and they would have to take a swing at him.  But Patrice, it was just so weird how you'd be able to do that.  I love the story Jimmy told about, like, the first fucking time you guys were in the car,  and he started shitting on you.  He started shitting on you.  We did a college together.  It was years ago, and there was a guy named, I think it was Jamie Dukit, who was a manager 
[01:42:30]  who might have worked for Barry Katz.  I don't remember the relationship.  And we did it at Nooner.  It was fucking, it was how I met Patrice.  It was years ago.  Terrible gig.  I might have had a one.  He might have had a two and a half.  And the headliner, Dom, had a minus four.  We bombed.  Where was it?  I honestly don't remember, but I know that Jamie had gotten me to drive that fucking idiot home.  So I'm stuck in the car with Patrice thinking he did a good job.  It was so annoying. 
[01:43:00]  And he's making fun of me.  He's like, yeah, you were up there like, I tell you.  I'm like, what, do you think you did well?  I'm like, you bombed too, stupid.  This is their first time.  Bragging over.  Oh, that's great.  But I found them to be very unlikable.  But I don't remember when we clicked.  Adrian asked me when we became friends.  I don't remember.  It just happened.  It just happened.  You were immersed in this world with somebody.  Was it from the Cellar or the Boston Comedy Club?  I don't remember the next trip we took together.  I know we did a long one to way upstate by Canada. 
[01:43:30]  It was me and him and my girlfriend, who I was with many years ago, I was with at the time.  St. Bonaventure?  No, it was...  That was your name?  It was by fucking...  It was like a seven-hour ride.  And we were co-headlining.  I headlined the Friday, and he headlined the Saturday.  And he said he was really annoyed because he was crammed in my back seat.  And I was all lovey-dovey with my chin.  He said, you fucking hated me that weekend.  Are you sweet to my girlfriend?  We wanted to have a nice romantic weekend, and I had this monster in the back seat. 
[01:44:00]  He's not the guy you bring.  No.  This fucking...  This big ball of negative energy.  He is.  I was on the green room with him.  Paul Provenza's show.  And all he talked about was why his career wasn't going to do better.  And he got the crowd, actually, on his side, rooting for him.  And he was saying he's never going to make it.  And I was saying, you're so funny, you have to stop this attitude.  I was basically saying, yes, we can.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Which made no sense, because I was like a white Jewish kid of entitlement.  He's so fucking...  The first time he came in, very intimidating physically. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, God, yeah.  But that went away so fast.  Like, the second he starts talking, you didn't get this impression like,  oh, this guy uses his fucking size to bully people around or anything.  No, he uses loudness to bully people.  His loudness.  Just a beautiful guy.  That was it.  But, yeah, I mean, I liked the guy right from the fucking start.  I thought that he was a prick.  I don't know why pricks can't die.  It's always a nice guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't really...  I can't think of anybody that's like, oh, you son of a bitch, joke-stealing comic died. 
[01:45:00]  You know, you don't really get to rejoice.  Are you okay?  You have, like, a throat thing?  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  You might not want to be in here today.  I mean, is it contagious?  I was totally contagious, like, two weeks ago.  You might have had whoopies cough.  This is my first day back.  No, I'm serious.  Whoopies cough?  Whoopies cough, yes.  You piss a little when you cough, because she pisses, apparently.  You may have.  Really?  Had whoopies cough.  The whooping cough.  Yeah, I don't know what it was.  What is that?  Is that like bronchitis? 
[01:45:30]  Pertussis.  I don't know.  It's an upper respiratory thing, but it's so bad.  Did they take Levaquin, that heavy shit that you take from the moment?  Yo, Levaquin.  No, I took a Z-Pak.  That's my youngest son.  Yeah.  I took the Z-Pak of fucking antibiotics.  Well, that's not really drugs, right?  No, that's antibiotics.  It kicked it out.  Did you go out on the roof with your gun and just shoot at shit?  You were so pissed?  I wished I could have shot the virus, but it resided in me and probably could have hurt  me.  Oh.  No, but no, it was bad last week.  Were you worried about that?  It was my first day back. 
[01:46:00]  We all were.  I didn't come in.  Of course.  I was out all last week.  He's been gone for a while.  This is his first day back.  My first day back.  Did you like it?  Was it like Kathy Lee by herself?  We did a show without each other.  Kelly.  It is what it is.  Yeah, it was.  It's good to have it back.  It's good to have it back.  But now my voice is kind of, you know, a little Brenda Vaccaro.  Yeah.  Hi.  If everybody said that she had a tampon in her throat, that was the joke.  That was the joke, right?  I had a tampon in her throat.  Hi.  I'm Brenda Vaccaro.  We were paranoid for sure. 
[01:46:30]  And Sam here is getting married in a couple weeks, so he was extremely paranoid.  He didn't want to be sick for his wedding.  But do you know who you're getting married to?  Yeah.  He's a fine gentleman.  They finally...  What's his name?  New York State finally said yes.  It's actually a girl.  Oh.  You guys have met her.  Her name is Jess.  Oh, we didn't know that.  Jess is so fucking out of his...  She's a very sexy girl.  He's so far out of his league with Jess.  How did you do it?  How did you get her to pull her in?  Jedi mind trick.  I knew her from...  We went to the same school. 
[01:47:00]  We didn't really hang out in high school, but then we started hanging out after school.  Why?  Too cool?  Yeah, I was a cool guy, obviously.  Too cool.  Yeah.  You met her right after high school?  Well, I started...  No.  I started dating her.  He was marrying black chicks.  Yeah.  He really liked black chicks for a while.  And she's like the first white girl he's ever been with, and he got to marry her.  He's like, fuck, white chicks are wild.  You're going to marry one of these.  They don't steal my shit.  All women don't throw stuff at you?  I started dating her when I was still in college, so right after my junior year at college, 
[01:47:30]  started dating her.  Is she a lot younger than you?  No, same age.  That's hot.  She's such a very pretty girl.  She really is.  And it's deserving of so much better than Sam.  Are you registered?  Like Crate and Barrel?  Yeah.  Crate and Barrel and Macy's.  That's exciting.  Macy's?  That's exciting.  Why Macy's?  What do you want?  I was with my ex-wife.  I have three daughters, and I was with her all day yesterday, and I'm going to dinner with 
[01:48:00]  her parents tonight.  Wow.  How was that?  It's interesting seeing them again.  I always said they're really nice people, unless you've ever met any other people.  Were your ex-wife's parents?  Yeah.  You get along with your ex?  Do you want to?  Why are you so friends with all of the kids?  Well, yeah, the kids.  Well, not friends.  It was a graduation.  But do you guys get along, kind of?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  We're fine.  You know, her checks, they clear.  Oh, man.  She never got remarried, huh?  She's got a boyfriend.  He's a nice guy. 
[01:48:30]  But why do you get remarried?  Everybody's nice.  That was nice.  But it was nice.  As soon as she remarries, then there go the checks.  Oh, I don't pay anything anymore.  Oh, you're good.  Yeah, I'm good.  You're clear.  I just want everybody to be happy.  Oh, of course.  I want my kids to be happy and all that shit.  I don't want him marrying one of them.  You don't put the kids in the middle?  I do sometimes.  You do?  Yeah.  You have an ex from a long time.  No.  You don't have an ex?  Well, an ex-girlfriend.  Oh, okay.  No kids are any of that shit.  That's right.  That's the ex-wife.  You have a baby now?  A two-year-old, yeah. 
[01:49:00]  That's right.  You had the baby when I was here.  That was the last time.  Mm-hmm.  It's been a while, Bob.  Yeah.  Where have you been?  Wow, that's true.  I've been out working.  I don't know.  Busy guy.  A lot of garden work.  You're starting a new tour?  Yeah, I'm touring to do a special.  You just shot a special, right?  Ooh.  I shot in Cleveland, yeah.  Was it fun?  It was.  Yeah, it's very stressful.  You know how that is.  I'm in stress mode over it, because it's got to be a new hour, and it's been like four years  since I had the new hour up and running.  So that's what I'm doing.  I'm going out and doing it.  When are you shooting?  I think July.  I'm just figuring out the deal right now. 
[01:49:30]  Okay.  Do you know where or you don't know?  I don't want to say, because I know that so many people listening want to book that theater.  Immediately.  Now, I wanted to shoot out of New York, just because I've been here so much, and I said,  you want to go somewhere where you haven't been in a little while, if possible.  Where no one's been.  Cleveland.  Exactly.  Yeah, you want to go somewhere where you haven't.  Betty White.  Betty White's been in Cleveland.  Cleveland.  Wow.  She's got that show.  They opened up their casino, finally.  Oh, they did.  Which would have been great when we were there a couple weeks ago to actually have something 
[01:50:00]  to fucking do.  I would have went to Opie and Anthony and introduced them, and it just would have been  Opie and Danny.  Well, that's true.  We would have been gone empty seats.  I'd have been like, what the fuck?  Another 21, you fucking dealers.  So where are you working in New York?  I'm not doing here.  I should.  I'm doing the Borgata in Atlantic City.  Okay.  Oh, I like that place.  I'm doing that a couple times this year, and I'm doing, I'm not working.  I'm just a guest.  I'm going to tell the places, hotels I'm staying in.  I'm in the presidential suite at the Hammond Casino. 
[01:50:30]  In a couple weeks, I'm singing this.  This could fuck me up.  I'm singing at the White Sox game in Chicago.  I'm doing it with that Hammond Casino.  I'm singing the national anthem.  Because they said you want to throw the first pitch, and I was like, that's going to be  nice if I throw a real gay, and it just goes into it.  You throw gay?  That never goes away, by the way.  If I'm throwing it back.  Bob Saget throws gay.  If I throw it a gay man, I think so.  But that's funny.  You'll probably get excited.  Yeah, that'd be hilarious.  You throw it poorly.  Dude, you know how cool it is to be able to actually throw a nice pitch?  Yeah.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  I've done it a couple times, and I played with Dave Wells a few times, and he treated 
[01:51:00]  me like I was a little, you know, small little monkey boy to try to teach me.  Yeah.  And it just, I don't think it's something I want to do at this moment, when I get off  a plane.  Oh, you should throw.  But national anthem, that would be cool, right?  Yeah, I'd rather throw.  How are you going to sing that?  I sing in my stand-up.  You know, it's, I'm a...  But that's a hard song to sing.  Very high.  Very hard song to sing.  You've got to start it very low.  How about you give us a little...  Let's hear one line.  Let's do this.  Let's do this, Bob. 
[01:51:30]  You've got to go...  You've got to start down.  Oh, see.  Five.  There you've got to go.  That's where you start, though.  You have to go deep.  I start with...  You'll never find...  You start that low, and you're still going...  You start that low.  You've still got to fucking...  I've got worries.  I do three bars from Porgy and Bess, and then I go into it.  And then that's it, and then go into it.  You is my country now.  Porgy and Bess.  You is...  David Allen Greer's in that now.  Is that Revival? 
[01:52:00]  Yes.  I hope it's not the first one, because we have a time problem.  The very first, Porgy.  Gershwin's alive, and he's back.  What's it about, Porgy and Bess?  What?  What's it about?  I've never seen it.  A guy that's on a cart, and he's handicapped, and then Porgy is...  It's kind of a West Side Story in its own way.  Ghetto people that love each other.  Sounds horrible.  Is it good?  It's pretty good.  It's horrible.  Yeah, I haven't seen it for a long time, but I heard it.  Were you on Broadway?  You were.  I did Drowsy Chaperone. 
[01:52:30]  Okay.  That's right.  All right.  Which makes me triple fruity.  But it was...  But I loved it.  It was like, I would do Broadway again if it was the right thing.  I heard you don't make money, though.  Colin said that it's hard to make money on Broadway, I guess, unless you're...  Because there's just so many expenses.  Yeah.  It's like when you do a theater, when you're out touring, they tell you what the expenses  are.  It's not hard to figure it out.  You know, it's a 2,000-seat house, and, well, it costs, you know, 15 grand, turn on the  lights tonight.  Oh, God.  I mean, you've got to get new light bulbs.  Yeah.  They're not energy efficient. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, fuck, man.  That's a lot of money.  That's why you do two shows in the same night.  The second show, you may have more money on.  Because they're already there.  That's why clubs do well for a lot of people, because they're able to...  There's nothing to do.  Right.  And there's a built-in draw, like, with the club's got its own people who would come to  the comedy club anyway.  Right, right.  So if you have 500 seats, 100 people would come anyway.  No one just shows up at a theater going, what's happening?  Right.  Exactly.  That's what's happening here tonight.  The house is already padded.  Yeah.  That sucks.  I like the casinos.  I do a lot of those. 
[01:53:30]  I'm doing...  There's one in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  Oh, I know.  There's all these casinos that are open up, and it's like...  Yeah.  Leno's going in, and Joan Rivers, and Kathy Griffin.  Oh, really?  I'm playing a lot of those kind of things.  That's great.  The comics, man.  Damn good.  It actually is, and they're so excited, because it's a town meeting, you know?  They don't really leave anywhere.  They go to the mall.  They do their day.  They go to Home Depot, and then they're seeing somebody that they've seen on the TV.  On the TV.  How big's the venue?  How big's the room?  A couple thousand people.  Yeah, I can't do that.  I could do smaller.  I could do a few hundred seats myself, but... 
[01:54:00]  If you came out blinking and stuff, and blinking and spinning...  Yeah.  What if you came out of curtains to smoke, and you walked out?  Just blinking...  They build a giant...  They have an orchestra.  Curds open, and you're like in a velour suit, and then that spotlight's the pin spot on  your head, and you're just blinking.  Just blinking, holding a martini.  Yeah.  The evening with Jim Norton.  Yes.  Getting ready to talk about how much you love to eat pussy.  Yeah.  And then the kids are crying as they run to the back. 
[01:54:30]  Smoking a pipe, talking about big clits.  Don't you like one that looks like a kneecap?  Where are you going, madam?  I'm not finished.  I'm sorry.  Camel head.  Yeah.  Shit.  Camel hindquarters.  Yes.  You ever see a cunt from Google Earth?  Miss, please.  Sit down.  Sit down, Frank.  Let me buy this family a drink.  Twits, twits.  Twink, twink.  That's funny, man.  How's the love life there, Bob?  It's good. 
[01:55:00]  I've been living with this woman for a couple years.  Oh, look at you.  It's good.  Look at me.  All fancy.  Younger than you.  Yeah, everybody's younger than me.  Oh, no.  I was able to start dating Bette Midler, so I'm fine now.  Who I had dinner with once.  She was cool as hell.  Yeah.  She's really cool.  Have you ever had her in here?  No.  No.  She would never come in here.  Yeah, she wouldn't come in here.  Because of the Blinken and the Clinton.  It just bothers her.  Or the Banthouse Connection we have, I'm sure she'd enjoy.  She used to perform in the Menwell, you know,  who hasn't been blown on the road. 
[01:55:30]  Why wouldn't we get her in here, Ethan?  I'm just because...  She is cool.  I would love to talk to Bette Midler.  She has some big stars in here.  But that type of an act, we don't get.  Billy Bob Thornton's in the building tomorrow.  We can't even get him.  Why?  Because they only want to talk about the record.  He's got a sling blade.  He's got a kill one of the men downstairs.  Get out of there.  We promoted that, what was it called again?  Mr. Woodcock for him.  He owes us one.  That was because of...  Sean William Scott.  Sean William Scott.  But he owes us now.  Yes, he does.  You should come in.  I have a picture for him to sign anyway. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  We did the Aussie tribute together.  Oh.  Yay.  Nice.  When was that?  At the end of 2009.  He was very nice to me, yeah.  I reckon I studied on killing you.  That's one of the greatest characters in movies.  I think it's fucking mind-boggling how good he is.  And Robert Duvall is so great as the father.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Creepy, all blind.  He had that clicky little sound.  Yeah, he made...  Yeah, yeah, he was doing that.  He wasn't speaking, right?  He wasn't even trying to say anything. 
[01:56:30]  He just had a nervous...  I'm your boy, name a Carl.  I'm your boy, name a Carl.  And then he just hauls out and just...  He doesn't tell the father.  Yeah, he does.  No, he kills the guy at the end.  He just left the father there.  He said, I reckon I'll just leave you there in that chair.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he just left him sitting there.  Damn.  I remember all the good stuff.  The world would be shut with you.  The fucking...  He wrote that. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  You gotta know, like, some weird fucking dialect to write shit like that.  Because the words he was using, it was amazing.  It's like Cajun.  Yeah.  And he scrapes around.  Billy Bob is today, actually, not tomorrow.  Oh, it is.  What time?  I think 10.  What shows is he doing?  He's actually doing a lot.  He's doing a...  He's doing a lot.  That makes it even worse.  For a movie he's promoting?  No, it's a record with him and Kinky Friedman, I think.  He is doing...  Is that true?  Yeah.  Does that not sound like a joke?  I used to open for Kinky Friedman.  Oh, is this a book?  Stars in Philadelphia. 
[01:57:30]  It's a book.  I'm sorry.  I'm not positive, but he's doing book radio.  He's doing Shade 45.  He's doing book radio.  He's doing Shade 45?  That might be a good kid.  Okay.  Yeah, but book radio, no one...  Oh, Christ.  Out Cue.  What's wrong with these guys?  So he could talk about Monster Ball.  Publicist fucking...  So he's just trying to sell a book and he's going on with Kinky Friedman?  They're doing it together?  Yeah.  Because he's a musical comedian.  Yeah.  The radio gets no one.  Fucking Shade 45.  What else are they doing?  Out Cue. 
[01:58:00]  What else?  Raw Dog.  Comedy.  They're doing the comedy channel, but they won't do...  I don't get it.  Why won't he do us?  Is it rolling around?  Playboy.  Radio.  Playboy.  That publicist should be fucking executed.  Here comes it rolling.  Rana Fez.  So Rana Fez got it.  They're doing Rana Fez.  And Outlaw Country.  Oh, boy.  So what?  Maybe he's in too late.  He's in at 10 o'clock.  Sounds like he made choices.  Yeah.  It sounds like it.  It sounds like he...  Maybe he didn't like how...  He purposely avoided us.  Maybe he didn't like how Woodcock went. 
[01:58:30]  Hey, we were nice.  We gave a shot.  You're always nice.  We gave a shot.  I wasn't even...  I'm not really promoting anything.  I just wanted to see you guys.  Oh.  I mean, I...  Where's Roland?  I'll see.  That's very nice of you.  I also brought some plastiques.  And anthrax.  Hi, buddy.  Do you want to see the guys?  Yeah.  Yeah, I miss them.  Roland, what's with these fucking...  Yeah, what happened with the Billy Bob?  I pushed and said, Jimmy did this with him.  Told her everything.  She goes, yeah.  We're just going to pass.  Oh, okay.  What is that about, you think?  You know this shit.  Who is the publicist? 
[01:59:00]  Who else did we have?  Yeah, who else does she have?  Cindy Cutman.  Yeah.  It's just the book publisher just passed on the show.  What kind of dumb book publisher does that?  That's kind of dumb.  I know.  Billy Bob Thornton can handle himself.  I know.  He's a funny guy.  But they take Shade 45.  That's good.  Not that that's a bad place to promote, but why wouldn't you take this show first?  Out of the demo.  Well, book radio.  Even Raw Dog, too.  What is Shade 45?  It's a rap station.  They're good.  I mean, but it's like we're fucking... 
[01:59:30]  We have the audience he's looking for.  Yeah.  White guys.  It's a terrible book publisher.  White guys.  What book company is it?  White people.  I don't know.  White people.  I don't want to...  You want to sell a book?  You go to white people.  Yeah.  Right?  Let's get this done.  Just some random company.  Let's be real here.  We all know blacks don't read.  Oh, Jesus.  What a dump.  What a dump.  I'm not sure where Raw Dog is.  It's 45 shades.  Is it five less than 50?  It's Shades of Grey, right.  That was a correlation.  Really annoying softcore porn over there.  Billy Bob.  Oh, he looks good in the picture.  What's his book about? 
[02:00:00]  Even in the picture, he looks like he should be on the show.  Yeah.  Right?  Well, I say fuck Billy Bob Thornton.  It's not Billy Bob.  They're on Amazon.  It's the book people.  It's not Billy Bob.  They never went to him and asked him.  Let's say fuck Billy Bob Thornton.  They're buying it right now.  That's what they're doing.  Yeah.  They're not promoting him, but they're buying the book.  Yeah.  He's got a little thing.  He's got that Adrian Brody-shaped little...  I see that.  He's in a ten.  Little beards.  It's a Billy Bob tapes.  What's that mean?  Maybe it's an audio book.  It's an audio book. 
[02:00:30]  Looks like you can do anything you want, according to the end of it.  Oh, there you go.  It says, no matter what you do.  It's the speech that was given at the college.  Same exact thing.  And Obama's our first gay president there, Bob Saget.  He does support it.  And he mentioned that.  Actually, the lady that...  What is that about, you think?  I think it's just about people should be able to be who they are.  And maybe they vote.  Let's get some people out of the...  No, we support all that.  But, I mean, him coming out, how he did with this statement. 
[02:01:00]  Was it because of Biden?  Well, Biden's one that they say...  You think Biden went rogue for real?  That's what it says.  That's what everybody's been saying.  It makes him look like he's more tolerant.  Right.  I think he was looking wishy-washy when he wouldn't commit to it before the election.  And then he just decided, yeah...  Do you think he feels like he could get votes?  No, I don't think...  I think it'll take away more votes than it gives him, to tell you the truth.  So why would he do that, then?  I don't know about that, though.  It might even out, because there are a lot of people that are types that go, 
[02:01:30]  the system can't help me, I'm not voting, because I'm a gay male.  Yeah, but the percentage of...  I hate quotes like that that can be taken out of context.  That's the soundbite.  Because I'm a gay male.  We all have them.  I don't know, though.  If you say that, how many votes are you really going to get from gay people,  as opposed to from the Christian, you know, right?  It's going to hurt him.  He's going to lose votes, but he's probably going to pick up money.  Like, because there's a lot of money.  Like, he's had these fundraisers recently, he's made a lot of money. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, a lot of Hollywood stuff.  It was smart for campaign funds, but I think it's going to hurt him a lot of funds at this point, right?  To me, I'm a complete layman, because I like to lay men, but...  Yeah, you're the gay man right there.  Gay man, singing in the dead of night.  Kelly Rogers, 1981.  Oh, wow, look at you go.  We'll see what I did.  I hate Billy Crystal, see what I did when I said, see what I did.  But what connects him is his passionate stuff, not the economy and not I killed bin Laden. 
[02:02:30]  What connects him is emotionally I care about people and you can come out of anything.  And I do believe that's what helps him connect as a speaker.  I think he's preaching to the converted, though, when he does stuff like that.  I think he's got to kind of branch out into people that want the economy better and, you know, want to do...  We understand he's, you know, he's a nice enough guy.  He's a passionate speaker when he's reading.  And we understand what he wants.  He's a really good reader. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, great reader.  But, you know, he's not turning anybody by saying, you know, he supports gay marriage.  And his constituency is still like, OK, we still like you.  Great.  But he's not turning any independents or any, you know, Republicans that are on the fence with that one.  I agree with you.  I think, but ironically, maybe there's some 16-year-old guy out there who knows...  He doesn't know he's gay.  Slower, slower.  What?  Just say this slower.  There's a 16-year-old boy. 
[02:03:30]  Oh.  He's at the door.  And he, you know, doesn't know what he is sexually because he's been told not to be.  And this is kind of a flag-waving moment.  So maybe that's some psychological thing that happens to the culture.  Which moves it forward if a person's like that.  Yeah.  What do you think of Mitt Romney?  What do you talk about over here?  He's the anti-Obama vote, you know?  He would be, the two of them would be the best news anchor team ever. 
[02:04:00]  Because Mitt would do the weather.  He was so good with the weather.  You give him a green screen, honestly.  We've got a guy in LA, Johnny Mountain.  You know, just one of those guys.  And Obama is your main newscaster.  Right.  He would be the main guy, I think.  Who do you get for the broad?  You've got to have a broad.  Lonnie Anderson.  Lonnie Anderson.  He'll bring it all together.  A news team you can trust.  No, you can't.  Did you see Prince Charles do the weather?  And Will Ferrell.  Will Ferrell would have to come in just to do it. 
[02:04:30]  You guys see Prince Charles do the weather?  Uh-uh.  It's kind of funny.  Where did he do it?  In a weird way.  Prince Charles was being funny?  Well, where did he do it?  He had a couple moments, I should say.  Maybe I misrepresented that.  In England or here?  In England, man.  It was a big deal.  He actually did the weather.  Oh, well.  You want to hear just a piece of this?  Sammy, whammy.  Oh, it's commercial, Sam.  Advert.  What happened?  That is a whole lifetime now that we never had to sit through advertisements.  I know.  And they don't always give you a skip this advertisement. 
[02:05:00]  No, they don't.  They're starting to not do the skip this ad shit.  Now you just got to sit through it.  Yeah, it's really unfair, but it is smart.  Yeah.  It's the only thing that's going to keep them uploading videos is the fact that they can make  money off it.  I mean, otherwise they'll just keep having them taken off.  Well, while you were stalled...  That's the voice I start the national anthem with.  Let's take a look at the weather for the past now.  I'm delighted to say we've got a new member of our weather team tonight.  Looks like he just had that removed from his column. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  Well, it's an unsettled picture as we head towards the end of the week.  I've never heard him talk.  This afternoon it'll be cold, wet, and windy across most of Scotland.  It's like Little Britain.  We're under the influence of low pressure, and this weather front pushes...  Pushing northwards is bringing cloud and outbreaks of rain.  Rain, of course, will be heaviest over the border.  Outbreak.  And around Edinburgh, where it could lead to difficult conditions on the roads.  On the road.  In the west, rain will be lighter and patchier. 
[02:06:00]  There will be maybe a few dry interludes over Dumfrey's house in Urshak.  Aha.  There'll be snow.  He's like a villain in a Roger Moore, James Bond.  Yes.  The potential for a few flurries over Balmoral.  Who the hell wrote this script?  As the afternoon goes on.  The best of the drier and brighter weather will, of course, be over the Northern Isles  and the far north of the mainland.  So, a little hazy sunshine to the castle of Maine, Keith Ness.  But a cold day everywhere, with temperatures of just 8 Celsius and a brisk northeasterly wind. 
[02:06:30]  Thank God it isn't a bank holiday.  Wow.  That's the only time I've ever seen him with personality.  I kind of liked it.  I did, too.  I was talking, that made him human.  Holy shit.  What happened?  Mommy, one day I want to do the weather.  Right.  Out.  And about.  Yeah.  He lived the dream.  I bet you he got sloppy drunk after that.  She sends him out, though.  Whenever she has large men of color coming over, whenever she has Lennox Lewis coming over  to fuck her, she sends Charles out to do the weather.  Or to do something fun. 
[02:07:00]  Don't you have to do the weather.  I'm so fucking irritated.  I can't.  Why?  All the Billy Bob Thorntons.  That annoys me so much.  He's a dick.  It's not him.  It's his publicity.  He was a dick to that.  We played the audio where he was doing an interview, and all he wanted to do was talk  about his band, and the radio hosts were trying to get some other shit done with their  interview, and he was just a cock.  Want to talk some Sling Blade with him?  Remember?  He didn't want to fucking bite.  We played that audio.  Yeah, we did.  I'm sure you've got to blame the publicist first. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, they're the ones who say no.  I almost fired mine recently, because she's pitching me for fucking shows, and I get the  list before now, because apparently she doesn't know that I don't do Stern, and she wanted  to pitch me for Stern.  Not that that's the worst thing ever, but it's like, do you understand that it's just  a show I'm probably never going to do?  If you're my fucking publicist, and you don't know that I'm not on that fucking show, dummy.  Mind-boggling.  That's disturbing.  It's like, you pay good money for the person to understand you. 
[02:08:00]  I understand Epics wanting to do it, because Epics doesn't know.  They haven't been working with me for fucking a long time.  Right.  Well, I'm just putting a list together.  By the way, Bob Saget, we said no to Jack Black, but we said yes to Bob Saget.  Thank you.  We did.  Thank you, but why did you say no to Jack?  Well, we used to have Jack Black on when he was coming up in the world.  Who we like.  He's funny.  He's nice.  I don't like him.  No, I don't like him.  Something happened.  Well, yeah.  Something happened.  I never found a particular amusing, but we've had him on, and I did a little Jay Leno show 
[02:08:30]  with him one time, and again, he might not have even heard me, but I said hello to him,  and he just kind of blew by like a douche.  So I was like, fuck.  All of a sudden, he started...  Were you covered in feces?  I really was, yes.  And you were twitching and blinking?  I was holding two of his films.  All of a sudden, he started becoming a big deal there in Hollywood and started blowing  us off, and then we'd only come back for the Tenacious D show.  So we said no to Jack Black.  Never.  Well, I just know that, you know, through all this, when we were on the Virus Tour, which  was one of the more fun moments I had, because it was hanging out with this guy and everybody. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, it was Patrice.  Sir.  And Louis C.K. and Louis Black, who I...  Yeah, I don't get to see anybody, but you guys basically helped my friendship level go  up, and you also are very supportive of everything, so I thought, why not go on when I'm semi-flaccid  in the promotion mode, and just piss off some young publicist right now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why aren't you on Stern more, Jim?  I've never done it.  I know.  Oh.  That's funny. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, you should be.  Yeah, well.  Go down the hall.  What does your mother say?  It's something like that.  He'd be lucky to have you.  Yes.  Yes.  The supportive mother says.  But it's not that big.  It's not a tragic thing.  I don't mean it like it's the worst thing ever, but it's just the idea that she doesn't  know the relationships between these shows and the weird nature of them.  That's what annoys me.  Is she a young Jewish girl from New York?  Older Jewish.  Well, not older, but she's older than I am, but it just annoys me.  And then take no responsibility for it.  Are you attracted to her? 
[02:10:00]  Not even a little.  Some publicists are cute.  I can't fucking do it.  I can't stand them.  Fucking.  They make my jaw tight.  I've met some that I like.  Like, I like Michael a lot.  Yeah, Michael.  I actually genuinely like him.  I should say his name because Michael O'Brien is one of the nicest people.  Michael O'Brien is a nice dude.  But he doesn't fit the mold.  No, no, no.  He loves comedy, and he's smart.  We got to tell Bob Saget our best publicist moment.  We had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  Oh, right.  NBA legend.  Probably easily top five greatest NBA players of all time. 
[02:10:30]  We saw him getting scolded by his publicist outside our studio because he talked basketball  on our show.  Basketball.  Why?  Because they just wanted to talk about the book.  He was always screaming at him like, you don't do that.  You just talk about the book.  It's all about the book.  See, the thing is, people got to tell their publicist.  Right in the hall, we were like, are we really watching Kareem Abdul-Jabbar get yelled at?  He must have fired her after that.  No.  You would think.  No.  She's notoriously horrible. 
[02:11:00]  She's been banned from the building.  She's been banned from this building.  She's not really...  I'd like to meet her.  But she came...  Somebody should do a documentary about her.  I would watch that.  Where's Roland?  He knows all the stories.  But she was banned from the building, but she came up with him that day.  This building, by the way, is a hard building to get into.  It really is.  You've got to get dots and things.  And I had to bring an ID.  I never bring an ID.  ID.  Come on.  You pop sack it for fuck's sake.  I tried to tell that.  They don't know.  You don't carry a wallet with you or no?  Well, I do for the condom.  Because you never know.  The one condom.  I have a California ID and a condom. 
[02:11:30]  I don't take...  No, I don't carry...  I have a wallet.  I had an interesting hotel story.  I locked my wallet.  I had no money.  So I had to take a cab and have my friend...  I was like a dirty loser hooker.  And my friend had to pay for the cab when I got there.  Take me to dinner.  And then put me in a cab with cash.  That sucked when you...  It was locked in the safe.  And I had 30 minutes.  And I didn't have time.  It says...  It starts counting down when you've tried too many combos on the safe.  So it's like...  Oh, shit.  Like a fucking movie.  Some espionage movie. 
[02:12:00]  In 30 minutes.  I cannot get my wallet again in 30 minutes.  And then there was blood on the shower curtain.  And I didn't know where that came from.  And that was like neck level.  So I figured somebody was strangled in there.  Yeah.  Someone was choked and killed.  Yeah.  And killed.  Nice hotel.  I liked it.  It's really pretty.  I'm staying in the Barton Fink.  It's down the town.  It's down the town.  Roland, you want to talk about this or no?  The look on your face.  She was an image consultant is her title.  Oh, really?  For cream, yeah.  Is that her?  I told you I have my suspicions on that relationship. 
[02:12:30]  No, she's a...  She was evil.  Oh, really?  Yeah, she screamed at everybody.  She was yelling and screaming at everyone because she was in the other, in that booth going,  they're not talking about the bunk.  Screaming.  We had a really good interview with the guy.  She can't see plugs.  Commemorative John Wilkes.  Once, twice, and a third time, she was wrapped.  She's a fucking fat monster.  That she was.  A fat, ugly monster.  And the problem is, because she's attached to Kareem, nobody says, shut the fuck up,  you fat bitch.  Right.  Shut up. 
[02:13:00]  Is she tall or is she short?  She's short.  I wouldn't know her if she walked in right...  She's a mess.  If she fucking walked in right now with Han Solo Frozen, I wouldn't recognize her.  I fucking hate all of them.  I really do.  I fucking hate all of them.  That was mine.  Yeah, we're mad about the Billy Bob Thornton thing.  I can't express to you how annoying I am.  Because we give him a good interview.  Was it his personal?  It was the book.  And that's what the best thing is.  These dumb book people.  Hey, assholes, your industry is drying up.  We sell books here.  Well, you wrote a book.  I'm working on one, so I'll come back in a year. 
[02:13:30]  Yes.  It's really about this show this morning.  This entire book.  Gotta write it.  Chapter four.  Jim was still noticeably upset about the publicist.  But it's almost like these book publicists, you fucking stupid assholes.  Nobody's buying books anymore.  Yeah.  Where are you doing your signings?  There's two Barnes & Noble left, fuckhead.  I'm in the Time Warner building.  The fucking borders is gone.  Right.  Yeah.  You fucking dummies.  There's one Barnes & Noble on like 80-something street.  And 45th Street.  That's it.  We got two in Manhattan, basically. 
[02:14:00]  In Manhattan, shut down.  It's all Amazon.  Those books sold well, though.  I wrote two.  They both hit the list.  We sell books on this show.  It's actually a much better show than people would think.  And the fucking annoyance I have with the publicists not knowing that.  If it was, again, a Bette Midler or somebody who wrote a book that's totally out of our demo, you get it.  But this is completely in our demo.  And they're doing other things that are in our demo.  But this fucking dummy just said...  And they're probably not doing Stern either.  No. 
[02:14:30]  How...  Wow.  Way to sell books.  What a dummy.  You guys sell a lot of books for that.  Sean and I.  And so would Howard.  Sean who?  Did she have a pretty face at all?  Military guy.  I'm sure.  Yeah.  Oh, uh, who?  The...  Publicist.  The soldier guy.  The Navy Steel guy, yeah.  Yeah, you sell tons of books for him.  Yeah, I know.  He sell books.  They're just dummies.  That's HarperCollins is the one who did the book.  It's the city of HarperCollins.  Yeah.  I forget the name that somebody told me.  William Moreau.  Dopes.  Dopes.  Yeah, I know Howard.  Dopes.  Dopes.  Smart move.  Way to sell books. 
[02:15:00]  Go to the comedy channel, you dummies.  Jimmy will be good in about six hours, Bob, by the way.  What do you have six hours for now?  I get very defensive with stuff like this.  I don't blame it.  It annoys me so much when people pass on the show who should do the show, and I know they're  passing on the show because they're ignorant and they're not good at their jobs.  Well, I also have a relationship with you guys, and a lot of people do, and I kind  of want to...  I miss you.  Yeah, I haven't been around a while.  No, I mean in a gay, holding a guy.  In a gay way.  Jack him off kind of way.  I want to meet with you again.  We did have fun meeting. 
[02:15:30]  I want to meet again.  And you're still married to the same...  I'm fucked, yeah.  That's awesome.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm a very...  I have a very good relationship.  I'm dating that publicist.  She's a wonderful woman.  Hey, you know we had Jodie Sweeten in here?  I did not know that was her book.  Did I ever talk to you about this?  We never spoke about it.  The best part is...  She's great.  She's a nice girl.  She's a very nice girl, and she has amazing tits.  She is.  I can't look below her nose.  Well, because to you, she'll always be just a little girl, right? 
[02:16:00]  A kid, yeah.  A little kid.  How old was she when the show ended?  Well, I told the judge she was...  Yeah.  Let's see.  How old was she when it ended?  She had...  God, probably 15 or something?  And we have a video, because we interviewed her, and the whole time, Jimmy is just taking  peeks over her tits.  Jeez.  That's so unlike him.  It's hilarious.  He can't help himself.  Everywhere he looks, there's a hand to hold on to.  He just keeps looking.  I'm close with...  I just landed the other day, and I said to Samos, where are you? 
[02:16:30]  Because he was in New York, and did a Beach Boys show, and...  What do you mean a Beach Boys show?  He was at the Beacon with them for a couple nights.  He goes and plays drums on Kokomo, because he was on the recording.  Because he was on the video, remember that?  Oh, shit, I forgot about that.  So I text him, what are you doing?  He goes, I'm sick.  It turns out we're at the same hotel.  Really?  I'm bringing him, like, vitamin C.  The show's even gayer now than it was, but it existed.  Yeah.  I'm bringing him vitamins and shit.  Oh, is that a video of...  Wow, look at that. 
[02:17:00]  You don't even need the audio.  You just look at Jimmy's eyes.  He tries.  He blinks.  He keeps looking down.  Is that you?  He's trying to send me.  He's the man.  I was probably at 14.  I mean, I'd probably had a sip of alcohol here and there, but really nothing.  I mean, not anything substantial, but at that point...  You see your eyes, Jimmy?  Jimmy's just a little bit of a crowd.  Is it tarting down?  That's great.  A little champagne.  Right.  I like this.  I was actually, like, three bottles of red wine.  Like, they started pouring it.  All right.  I hope she's doing well, Bob.  She seems to be. 
[02:17:30]  I hope so.  She was really nice.  We liked her a lot.  She's got babies.  She's very happy.  A couple babies, right?  Yep.  And her husband's a nice guy.  I've known him a long time.  Yeah.  I hope she comes back.  We had a good time with her.  You want me to call her?  Yeah, let's do it right now.  You see the Olsen twins?  I haven't seen him this trip yet.  You always see him.  I do my scleroderma benefit here in town.  I'm doing it October 22nd again at Caroline's.  They always...  They were there last year.  It's a philanthropic view.  You know, my sister died of it.  I'm trying to help people with it.  I'm not...  You know, what am I going to do?  They died of this horrible disease as opposed to the good ones. 
[02:18:00]  As opposed to dying of the good ones.  What makes this one horrible?  I hear this one's a motherfucker.  It hits your internal organs and your...  You know, a lot of pulmonary hypertension.  Yeah.  This is your demo.  Yeah, there you go.  You know, pulmonary hypertension.  Oh, my God.  He's talking about us.  It's when your lungs close down and your esophagus scleroderma means hardening of the skin.  So it was a bad out to watch.  So we're trying to...  Is it hard to breathe when you have that?  Terrible, yeah.  It's hard to swallow, which cuts out your dating life.  Oh, man. 
[02:18:30]  But it's, you know, scleroderma means hardening of the skin.  So Seth Meyers has already agreed to do it.  We do it on Caroline's October 22nd.  I'd bring you out, but I think they might think you have it.  I'm never going to invite it to stuff like this.  I would invite you.  I revere you.  Your stand-up kills me.  I can't...  And you would actually be perfect for it.  We always have really funny...  Colin did it last time.  Seinfeld did it, which you're very similar to, Jerry.  I am, yes.  Where are they at with the cure?  They're doing pretty well.  Well, Johns Hopkins is one of the centers that we fund, the Scleroderma Research Foundation, 
[02:19:00]  and they got like 3,000 patients, so there's more clinical trials.  Is that a stem cell thing?  It can be, but that's not what's curing people.  What's curing is kind of the cocktail drug, similar to how you've been able to cure cancer  and AIDS when you can.  Right.  So they do...  There's a new drug called Clear.  There's all this different stuff.  How old was this sister?  She was 47.  How long she had it?  She had it only for three years.  I guess she may have had it her whole life.  I don't know, or they say, some people say it's autoimmune.  I'm told they're not fully correct. 
[02:19:30]  It's vascular.  What was the first sign?  I think there was some in my shower on the curtain.  Yeah, yeah, right?  What was the first sign she had?  Was it in the hands?  She stopped watching my television appearances.  That's the first sign that people can get it.  If people watch me on TV, they can stay healthy.  Yeah, so they can focus on that misery in their own physical...  It was her fingertips.  It was, right?  Same with Lucian.  Ray Doe's arthritis.  It looks like when your fingertips turn blue and stuff.  Oh, no.  I think I got that.  No, you don't have that. 
[02:20:00]  You just had whooping cough.  I know.  You just made everyone look at their fingertips.  And then, yeah, Lucian's fingers, I think, is where it started.  Lucian had it.  Yeah, it was in the fingers it started.  He was a sweet man.  Is that the one way...  I didn't like him at all.  He was fucking nasty to comedians.  He was?  He was fucking horrible.  I only knew him sick, so I was trying to help him.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Different.  Is that the disease where you could get a double lung heart transplant?  I don't know about that.  I had a friend whose wife had a double lung heart transplant.  And it sounds like it was this disease.  There's so many lung diseases, though, but that are... 
[02:20:30]  I've got to find out now.  And I went to dinner with them after the double lung heart transplant.  It was one of the most bizarre nights I ever spent.  How is she doing now?  We've lost touch a little bit.  But, you know, last I checked, she was doing great.  I don't blame you.  I only talk to people who have their own lungs and heart.  I hate people.  But she's sitting there with someone else's...  How is my lungs done?  Someone else's shit.  How do you go through life knowing you've got someone else's lungs and heart in you?  That's so weird.  And she was breathing a little weird because she was still getting used to it.  Right. 
[02:21:00]  So there was like a...  As she was breathing and talking.  My dad had a friend who had two heart transplants, and he's alive today.  My dad's dead, but this guy is like 89.  He had two heart transplants.  How did he get on the list twice?  I don't know.  He's a lucky fucker.  Did he get a bad one the first time?  Or was it just...  Actually, the helicopter had to come in to take the other one out and then...  Yeah, right.  ...tagged him to put the new one in.  God bless him.  Yeah.  Two hearts.  Two hearts in one.  Oh, damn.  Oh, man.  But he must have...  He must have had money.  He didn't have any money. 
[02:21:30]  He worked for a supermarket company.  A meat company.  I think they just replaced him with a cow's heart or something.  I don't know how that works.  I wonder if they could do that.  Just take like a goat.  I think they tried with like the baboon heart.  They put it in a kid once.  My dad had pig shit in it.  Your body just really says, get that out of me.  My dad had pig shit in his...  The pig heart?  No, they went pig valves.  Pig valve.  They did the pig valves.  He had a...  To your heart, really?  Yeah, he had a pig valve.  When it's a valve, it's like the sphincter of a pig?  I guess.  They take out the bubble.  I guess.  I don't know.  They take the asshole of the pig out and they put it where your heart is.  It's a heart valve.  Why wouldn't they... 
[02:22:00]  Oh, I guess they're making human organs now.  Yeah.  They do something, though, with the valve to make it so your body doesn't really attack  it.  Yeah, there's medicine.  That rejection medicine.  And that fucks you up.  It makes your skin all weird and glowy.  But that's what you have to take forever?  They do treat the...  Yeah, because you have to stay on it.  They treat the valves and stuff where you don't have to take as much of those drugs  anymore.  Because they kind of take out the shit in the valve that your body goes, ah, get it 
[02:22:30]  out of here, man.  So your body welcomes the pig valve.  Yes, welcome pig valve.  I just wouldn't take a pig valve, I don't think.  No?  No.  I don't know.  I mean, I'm not religious or anything.  Well, yeah.  You would take whatever.  I just don't dig on swine.  It just sounds like you're having sex with a pig.  It's a filthy animal.  Do you think people have their sphincters replaced?  Boy, I don't know if that can be done.  Can you donate your asshole?  I'd love to.  To that publicist.  Yeah.  Eat this, stupid. 
[02:23:00]  Hope you hit the bestseller list.  Good luck.  A donor sphincter.  That's just dumb.  Don't do our show.  Here's my sphincter.  We have a match.  You guys on a helicopter and a cooler with an asshole in it.  I would love to tap him and go, do you know how dumb this person is?  I would love to tell him that.  Well, we have that opportunity.  He arrives at 10.  Let's do it.  Oh, do you got this person coming at 10?  Well, Billy Bob is going to be in here at 10.  With the other, with the next.  Who's in here?  Ron and Fez.  But they're on, what, 11?  I think so. 
[02:23:30]  So, Billy Bob's going to make the rounds to the gay station, the black station, the book station.  What is he, the president?  I know, right?  He's amazing.  An amazing man.  But not our show.  Are you ever going to do a virus again?  Yeah, man.  Yeah, we got to do it.  We should have done it this summer.  We got lazy.  Maybe next summer.  That one that I did, that was the last one for a while, right?  Which one did you do?  Oh, right.  You did Detroit, I think.  Yeah.  If I remember correctly.  We were in Detroit.  I did a few of them.  I did Philly.  I did Boston. 
[02:24:00]  And, God, that lineup was amazing.  Yeah, that was a crazy lineup.  The first Boston one we did had Tracy closing it.  It was outside.  We couldn't get in Boston because of that fucking sickening mayor.  Oh, right.  So it was outside of Boston.  I was there.  Right.  Tracy Morgan went on last.  I did one.  The reason I brought it up is a couple months ago, I did the one at the Gibson, which used  to be the Universal Amphitheater in L.A.  And Larry King opened it.  And Jim Jeffries was on it. 
[02:24:30]  Yes.  And Eddie Izzard, who's pretty brilliant.  Yeah.  And I brought Stamos out while I was singing Danny Tanner is not gay.  It was a beautiful show.  It was actually an amazing show.  I was going to say, that's a good moment.  It made me miss the eight-person lineup of people that you regard highly.  And you want to listen to the other people.  How was Larry King?  We've had him in twice.  He was interesting.  We love him.  But how was his stand-up?  Does he pull it off?  Yeah, he tells stories.  Right.  You know, he stands there and he's not shaking or anything, which is good.  Yeah.  That's what he's doing. 
[02:25:00]  And he's like, you know, just, well, what I did, you know, do we have a collar?  You know, he just brought his wife out for a second.  She took a bow.  And it was, he did some jokes, did some old jokes, told a couple of stories.  Was he divorced and had a new wife by the end of the act?  Because that would be interesting.  No, he loves her.  And they have two kids together or something.  He was telling me I should, you know, have another family again.  Suggested it.  Well, that's him.  You know.  Just have another family.  Go ahead.  Do it.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Some people do that.  Do you come from homes where they had one family and then started another one? 
[02:25:30]  No.  Very odd.  No.  Anyone I've known for those type of situations have always been girls of questionable,  promiscuous, let's say.  Ethics.  Yeah, girls don't like when their fathers leave and start up new families.  And it makes Christmas real fucking pleasant, too.  It's a bad independent film.  God, yeah.  Yeah.  I went out with one of those.  I was married to one.  Me and Ann went out with one of those.  I was married to one.  Different, but yeah.  All of a sudden, the father left on Christmas Eve and fucking just started a new family 
[02:26:00]  somewhere else and ditched the old family.  And every Christmas I'd hear, you know what happened to me on Christmas?  Yeah.  What's happening to me every fucking Christmas Eve, you're making it miserable.  Is it possible that he was trying to be like Santa and that's the night that he had to  go do his philanthropic work?  I probably brought that up to try to shut her up.  To be fair, though, maybe he's bringing gifts to children.  Yes.  To be fair, what a dick.  Here's your picks, Victor.  You couldn't wait one day?  Oh, I know. 
[02:26:30]  One stupid day.  Believe me.  You're already miserable.  That's how annoying his wife must have been.  No kidding.  He had to get out on Christmas.  But get the fuck over it.  One fucking day.  You know what a cunt you have to be to chase a guy out on Christmas forever?  Wow.  Yes.  I absolutely do know a cunt.  Oh, my God.  Just for that, you're not going to get your Benoit balls I bought you.  You probably just wanted to save some money, huh?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow, that's a dick move.  I have a question for you guys.  There's so many podcasts now, which is the last time I was here. 
[02:27:00]  It's been two years since I was here, and I was on.  I mean, it's fucking everybody.  Everyone's got one.  Has one.  I did Jim Jeffries the other day.  I did Jay Moore's.  Yeah.  Jay's got a good one.  Yeah.  What's the deal?  It's just, you guys, it's a completely different world.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Now, we wish we could do an hour a week.  That would rule.  And then it sits on iTunes.  But I don't know.  You would never do one, right?  You're here.  Oh, God.  We would do it in a second.  I would like to do it in addition to this. 
[02:27:30]  I'd be bored just doing an hour a week.  It's nothing.  It could be the best of.  You do that anyway.  I like doing four hours a day.  Right.  I really do.  I mean, you know, I love doing this.  Because in order to tee it up and to get the thoughts out and to go through.  It's relaxing.  It's fun.  It's like we play around.  We talk.  It is true.  Yeah.  To do an hour a day even would be fucking awful.  It goes by too fast.  Hour a day.  And for me, as a kid, they asked me if I wanted to do a podcast.  I was like, I had too much going on where I've got to do that every day.  Yeah.  And then you're watching them.  No, you do one hour a week.  That's what they're doing.  It's perfect for you.  So, yeah, because you've got other shit going on. 
[02:28:00]  Maybe it wouldn't work for us because we don't have other shit going on.  But you guys, it's perfect.  One hour a week.  You guys could have other shit going on if you wanted.  But this is a job.  We should release a podcast to support the radio show.  Yes.  But to just do a podcast.  That's what you could do.  Take the best moments.  You won't get anything out of me today.  We'd love to.  No, just so we're.  I fucking hate Billy Bob.  And then promise us.  Oh, Billy Bob.  That's the moment of the day.  No, just so we're in that world.  I brought it to the attention of the guys down the hall.  They still haven't gotten really back to us on it.  No.  I'm like, it's a whole world we should be involved with no matter what. 
[02:28:30]  Because there's a lot of material.  We've been on satellite eight years now.  There's a lot of material we'll never play again.  That's really good.  You've got crazy shit you've done.  Yeah, so you just throw that on an hour podcast just so we're in that world.  You should.  It should be a bit.  And it would turn them on to hopefully the satellite show.  You can get some guys.  It's not him.  He's getting married.  He's going to be too busy.  But somebody should comb through all the stuff.  Yes.  I tried, bro.  Pearls.  I tried.  Just come up with some shit.  Do a best of.  Like everything else, it just lays on a desk for literally years.  I met a woman that way.  Years. 
[02:29:00]  You see these lights?  Yeah.  These beautiful.  It took almost two years to get these.  Two.  It's like the federal.  Years.  It's like the Air Force.  Yeah.  That's what we're dealing with.  So to get these guys to understand that a podcast would be good for the show and the  company.  I don't know.  Well, it's the iTunes of it all.  It's all that shit.  Yeah, but we'd be on that iTunes list.  People are on iTunes all the time.  I thought you were on there.  It would be a great exposure.  You're not on there?  No.  We might be illegally.  The fact that we don't have a weekly podcast, which would have like an hour or an hour  and a half a week of the best of the radio show. 
[02:29:30]  The fact that some people don't understand the promotional value.  It's like there's nothing I hate more than just dummies.  Yeah.  And that's just dumb.  Yeah.  I could see not wanting to give away four hours a day of content.  Of course, because you want people to.  But an hour of stuff we're not going to play anyway.  It's perfect.  Perfect.  You could take every single one of these broadcasts.  Was your goal to just piss off Jimmy?  I've been doing it multiple times.  What's this?  How's stand-up gone?  Are you loving it still?  You've been doing this how many years?  Because I'm starting to love it right now, but I'm working on the new hour. 
[02:30:00]  You just shot your hour.  I started in 1990, so I would say, what are we in now?  Almost 22 years.  Wow.  Yeah, I just shot the hour and I'm back.  I'm just doing new stuff now.  So now you go up.  Are you doing gigs or you go to the cellar and you just work it out?  When I bounce around the city, I do 15, 20, I was really enjoying Travolta, but unfortunately  that fucking case is going to be wrapped up quick.  Right.  So that's fucking a good six minutes down the toilet.  We got the Royal Caribbean guy. 
[02:30:30]  We got audio.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Of what happened.  Oh.  I hope he sues.  Not that I want Travolta to get sued.  I just want this to keep going.  I'm doing Leno at the end of June to promote my special.  I want to talk about Travolta.  I don't want it to be out of the news already.  Yeah.  Maybe you should somehow get in and massage him.  Well, I should.  Find out where he's staying and just say, I got a free massage for Mr. Travolta.  Well, I should sue him for turning me on with his stories.  Stories of massage.  Why am I having these feelings?  And sue him for $200 for new pants. 
[02:31:00]  I watched Face Off four times today.  Yeah.  That's what it's about.  It was originally called Wipe Your Face Off.  It only took me 90 minutes.  And we want to thank Bob Saget for stopping by today.  That's funny, dude.  We do have to take a break.  That's a killer line, bro.  I don't have to tell you.  There's the podcast.  Bob Saget on Twitter.  Tour starts May 25th in Kansas City, Missouri.  All dates are up on bobsaget.com.  When do we get to see you in New York?  I'll be here. 
[02:31:30]  I'll be here.  I'll shoot the special, and then I'll come here like a man.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  So you're just going to go out and do a lot of weekends together?  A lot of them.  Do you have some new stuff already?  It's a new hour.  Oh, you do have it?  I'm doing the new hour.  Oh, you are?  Okay.  Which is what I love about it.  Still dirty?  It's pretty filthy.  I didn't think it was, but then I've just been doing it.  I know we bring it up every time, but to go to a Bob Saget show and see those full  house people going, what the fuck?  And they're bringing more older people now.  It's hilarious.  I got 16-year-olds and 80-year-olds.  Right.  And some people in between, but they don't. 
[02:32:00]  Look, Grandma.  It's unbelievable to see.  And I'm eating well, but I can't.  I'm just telling people not to fuck animals, pretty much.  I got about 10 minutes on that.  And people just didn't know.  You were always kind of a dirty guy.  It's just, and it's a...  They had no idea.  It's a real sweat lodge for me.  It's fun.  I feel very comfortable.  It's fun to watch.  Thank you.  All right, Bob.  We're going to take a break.  Bob Saget, our pal.  Are you sick of eating the same old boring options for lunch?  Well, here's an idea.  Break out of the same old and try something new. 
[02:32:30]  Quiznos.  They brought the Quiznos in yesterday, and we destroyed it.  We were very happy with what they gave us yesterday.  Thank you, Quiznos.  Head to Quiznos today.  Try over 25 new craveable menu items, including the new chicken Milano, the savory new sandwich  meat with all-natural chicken piled high on artisan bread, toasted to perfection with melted mozzarella and an Italian three-cheese blend, topped with fresh tomatoes and a seasonal lettuce blend, and the big flavor of smoky sun-dried tomato and basil pesto. 
[02:33:00]  So, that's a lot of shit in one sandwich.  I hope they don't mind the word shit in their library.  But I meant that in a nice way.  And it's a good result from a delicious meal.  Yeah, it's a lot going on in that sandwich.  I actually had that one yesterday.  It was delicious, Anthony.  Quiznos' new menu is loaded with flavor from sandwiches, flatbreads, and sub-sliders.  Jimmy had the sub-sliders.  He couldn't stop eating the sub-sliders.  Just salads and wraps.  Quiznos, before you head out to lunch, go to Quiznos.com to check out the new menu items. 
[02:33:30]  I'm trying to make Quiznos sound exciting.  It does.  I want one.  All right, good.  Sign up for the Q Club for your access to exclusive deals and savings.  Escape from the boredom of an ordinary lunch.  Head to Quiznos today.  Try one of their 25 new menu items like the new chicken Milano on your favorite artisan bread.  You'll feel like your mouth just took a trip to Italy.  I can't say anything.  It won't be good.  Why?  I would just say something filthy.  I don't want to say that.  They can cut that part out.  All right.  You mean like a pig sphincter? 
[02:34:00]  All right.  Can they put that on there?  I don't know.  Can they put cheese from my balls on there?  I would eat that if it was on a Quiznos sub.  The bread would make it tasty, I think.  That's why Jim's in the toilet right now.  He loved that Quiznos.  He really did.  I've been in the toilet so many times with Jim, and he just takes dumps.  Yeah.  And he's happy about it.  He doesn't mind dumping.  No.  Right now, he might be dumping something.  He makes a Quiznos sub that's the size of one, the same metric weight.  Quiznos, I've got to do the, how do you do M, M, M, M, M? 
[02:34:30]  No, I don't do it that way.  Because look, all the M's are together.  Mine's like this.  Mine's like.  All right.  Do that.  Toasty.  We're hanging with Bob Saget today. 
[02:35:00]  It's a pleasure to be here.  Oh, it's a pleasure to have you, Bob.  I feel like I'm being fluffed.  We were going to the bathroom, and Bob told me that when he pisses, it reminds him of  an ex-girlfriend.  For some reason, it's like a mantra.  Her name comes up, but only when I urinate.  That's it.  Why?  Did she stand when she did it, too?  She did.  She used to stand behind me.  We would cross swords, and I would feel threatened.  Why only when you pee? 
[02:35:30]  I don't know, but I laugh out loud sometimes when that happens, because I can't believe  it's happening.  I don't think of her all the time.  You know, just occasionally.  What kind of relationship did you have with her?  We just peed on each other.  You peed on each other.  No, it wasn't like that.  I don't know.  I don't know why.  She was probably one of my unhealthiest relationships.  I was divorced, and it was new, and she was a nice person, and all those disclaimers that  you would say before you said the other thing that you think of her when you pee.  But the post-divorce relationship, always the best one. 
[02:36:00]  Always so healthy and stable.  Divorce is hard as shit.  Like, I had people die, but divorce, I think, is harder than just about anything.  Yeah.  I think.  What was going on with this girl?  I need to know.  What was her problem?  With you.  She had publicist genetics.  Oh, really?  She had a very outgoing personality.  Did she get loud in public?  Yes.  Late night, you know, late night drinking and arguing at two in the morning.  The scene maker? 
[02:36:30]  The scene maker.  Good scenes.  Yeah.  You know, you could see in her face, no matter how far away your helicopter was, how upset  she was.  Oh, that sucks.  You could have a telephoto lens, and you'd be able to register that Bob's in trouble right  now.  Yeah.  And you could feel it spatially.  How long did you date her?  I think about a year.  I haven't had many girlfriends between, it was a marriage and then a few girlfriends.  But it feels like I've got it right. 
[02:37:00]  Because now when I urinate, I just think about myself.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  That's healthy.  I think about my penis and my urine.  Were you joking in the bathroom when you said you also think of another girlfriend when  you shit?  I was joking.  Okay.  I never know with you, though.  Yeah.  All right, because.  Well, yeah, I've never really thought of another person.  When you were shitting.  Not a person.  Right.  Creatures.  Right.  You always bring up wild animal sex and stuff.  And I was in the bathroom with you once, years ago, at the other station. 
[02:37:30]  And you were taking a crap, and you were really excited about it.  Really?  Yeah.  You just said how much you'd love to take a good, firm dump.  Oh, I don't remember.  I believe you.  Because I really do.  That was no lie, Bob.  No, no.  Yeah, see how we don't change.  And you can go, oh, I definitely said that.  Yeah.  Most indubitably.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That sounds like me.  But if I would have said watery shits are the best, I'd be like, you're confusing me  with someone else.  And what's odd is when you go into a bathroom, like at an airport, I'll, you know, you got  to find the first class lounge or whatever the hell they call them. 
[02:38:00]  But I just, no matter what, you go in other people's feces rooms.  It's just, I don't like anybody's, I'd rather hold my shit in.  God, I don't think twice about it.  I don't care.  You just do it.  Wow.  I can't breathe the other air.  I know it's your shit.  And I know it's in the air.  It's in my lungs.  Long Island Railroad bathroom.  I don't give a fuck.  I'll sit right down.  Sometimes I won't even wipe the seat.  So you're smart.  You're a man.  It's like the army.  I don't know if I'm a man.  There's a lot of guys that don't like doing that for some reason.  I'm a fucking gentleman when I shit.  I don't even think twice. 
[02:38:30]  You're a gentleman.  Yeah, you, by the way, I remember staying in the toilet longer when Jim was in there and  he was taking a, and you're, I don't, I don't think your dump smelled at all.  And I was underneath the, my head was under there.  I was inhaling.  I was trying to see what you'd eaten.  Oh, Timmy's terrible.  My gases are fucking putrid.  I've never been around that.  You will be soon.  Well, you know, I was here one time.  We talked about this, I think on the air once, where I got a text from you.  Oh, yeah.  And we exchanged numbers.  We were all excited.  And you were like, hey, can you give a brother a hand? 
[02:39:00]  I was out doing Broadway.  I was doing that drowsy chaperone and I got a text.  I'm sitting there with my kids.  Can you give a brother a hand?  I'm going to need a helping hand or something, which was the code word.  I would talk to the masseuse who should come over and jerk me off.  And he goes, I'm not kidding.  I mean it.  And then I went, Jim, it's Saget.  Oh, man.  I texted Becky.  I went, holy fuck.  I meant I was saying this to a chick to tell her to jerk me off.  Yeah, it was this chick with a giant fat pussy who used to come over.  He said, sorry, buddy. 
[02:39:30]  How'd you make that mistake?  The second I thought he wanted to jerk me off.  I was like, I like Jim.  Wait a minute.  You ever mix up a text?  It happens all the time.  I still have that one saved, I believe.  And happy Mother's Day.  I make sure, man.  There's some texts I send out where I'm like, look at the name.  Look at this.  Look at the picture you attached.  Yeah, the worst is email, too, when you do that.  Oh, once you get sent.  Gmail is good for that.  Look at the pack.  Yeah.  Where you fucking, everyone in the chain gets it.  Yeah.  When you were telling that.  Well, gonorrhea is really bad.  Look at this picture.  It goes out to everybody. 
[02:40:00]  When you were telling the story, I thought Jimmy did that just to fuck with you.  No.  Oh, that's fucking totally true.  That's totally true.  He thought it was this girl that was going to come over.  That's funny.  I laughed out loud.  Of course.  And my daughters were there, which makes it a little buzzkill.  Yeah, a little creepy.  It started creepy and ended worse.  Boy, you've got to watch some of that shit, man.  Like what you're sending out.  Oh, fuck yeah, man.  Oh, fuck.  And we do it.  I like to answer fast, so I have it off my OCD plate.  That doesn't help.  No, because you could really screw up. 
[02:40:30]  I've done it.  I've done it before, but it's been pretty innocent shit I've sent.  But when I think, you know, something, you want to get that photo and attach it, you're  like, did I attach the right photo?  Let me make sure again.  Right.  Because, yeah, you don't want to send that one to mom.  What about all those people that are on, like, sleeping pills, and I, like, old friends  of mine, and maybe they're divorced, and all of a sudden the lady, right, I'm not being 
[02:41:00]  misogynistic.  The lady.  The lady sends me at three in the morning with her entire address book something that  says, you know, hey, I'm really sorry that I sent out that last spam because my computer  has got a virus or something, and it's a Mac, it doesn't have a virus, she's just on sleeping  pills.  She's fucked up.  She's fucked up.  And she went into some bad site that sells something or it's porn, or you don't even have  to hit anything to get on porn anymore.  You just put in the letter B.  Oh, it's great.  Balls in your mouth is the number one hit. 
[02:41:30]  Or teeth.  I got it.  You got an Ambien story there, sir.  I was on a plane, and this was an outrage, actually.  We were, they led a guy on a flight, and it was a United flight out of L.A.  I can't remember where I was going.  It was a couple weeks ago because I was on Ambien.  No, I can't remember because I can't remember.  And they bring this guy on who's in this, he looks like a something, some monster, CGI,  Star Wars bar kind of guy, moving slow, and he's on Ambien. 
[02:42:00]  And they take him to his seat, and he's looking around like he's psychotic.  I thought he was just a mental, just, I mean, this is a horrible thing to say, just a mentally  ill man that they were going to, you know, he's going to a home or something.  Right, they got to fly him to the hospital.  They got to take him to the center and be taken care of and try to work with him again  and get his brain back, his sling-bladed mind.  And so they put him in the seat, and then he starts yelling out weird things. 
[02:42:30]  And I said to the flight attendant, and I don't know why they talked to me, but they'll  tell me anything simply because of my factory.  So she says, I said, what's going on?  She said, well, he's on Ambien.  She shouldn't be telling me this.  She goes, he took an Ambien, and it was before the flight, so he took it a little early.  I said, yeah, maybe, like, the drink cart is a good time.  Wow, man.  And they kept coming over to him going, are you okay, are you okay?  And he was disruptive and loud, but moving around, he kept standing up.  And they wouldn't escort him off the plane, so we took off with this guy in the seat. 
[02:43:00]  This lunatic.  Because if you're drunk, if you put a totally smashed person on a plane, you've got to get  rid of him.  Yeah.  How was he the rest of the flight?  Did he eventually conk out?  He did, actually.  I think he shit his pants, but he was far back enough away from me.  They do tell you everything, don't they?  They tell me everything.  They recognize.  Because Saget is such a recognizable guy.  We forget because we know him, but you're...  It's like being in a big bird suit.  Because I was in two family shows, you know? 
[02:43:30]  And they tell me everything.  And it's usually like, oh, my family and I still watch that.  Or a lot of times, they're like, you're so dirty.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's always the flight attendants that are, you know, they're just my age and walking  around.  My kids love you.  They watch the show.  Well, you walked through an airport with them.  Yeah, yeah.  It was fucking bizarre.  We met on that plane.  Yeah.  It was the next day you were doing this show.  Yeah.  And I was like, hey, Bob Saget.  Hi, Anthony. 
[02:44:00]  I hope you're doing our show tomorrow.  And I was like, oh, cool.  Let's walk to the fucking baggage plane.  And yeah, people just, they don't stop.  It's a nice thing.  You're a tall gentleman.  You like it, Bob?  I do.  I like people, basically.  I've been loving, if I'm in a mode where I'm a little bit more agoraphobic, I kind of  just stay home.  But if I'm out in tour mode, you know, I'm out working.  Yeah.  And so that makes me a little more accessible.  And people are usually really nice.  Sometimes they just say dumb shit.  Do you only do carry-on? 
[02:44:30]  So you don't have to stop at the baggage plane?  I said karaoke.  I do karaoke in my act now.  I don't.  I check luggage.  Like this trip, I was gone for eight days.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I had to bring suit.  Kind of hard to just carry on eight days' worth of luggage.  Yeah, but I'm saying, you just stand there.  You weren't, right?  What's that?  Would you do eight days with the carry-on?  No, I couldn't.  It would carry-on.  No, I would take a bag if I had to.  But I'm not going to get recognized like you are.  The fact they're charging now for bags, even, like first bags.  It was, okay, if it's over a certain weight or if it's over a certain number, now it's 
[02:45:00]  every piece of luggage.  So it's fucking up everything because now everybody just wants to carry on.  So they overpack.  They got too much carry-on.  All right.  They're trying to go through security with all their possessions now.  And they're mad.  They're mad.  Because if I'm privileged to be in first class and they want to put their bag in there,  I'm sorry, that's reserved.  It's like you can only, if you're in first class, you have to shit in the first class bathroom.  Right.  You can't have a coach person come up.  I agree.  Exactly.  I want to rack them out when they do it.  When I see them drop it and keep walking, I would go, you fuck. 
[02:45:30]  They call them on it.  Sometimes they panther them.  Oh, man.  When I see somebody from coach put their luggage in first class, I wait until they do it.  Then I open the hatch.  I take it out.  I throw it back down the aisle.  Take your shit and keep it back there with you people.  I had a guy who was very strange.  He had two sons with him.  He was in first class.  And his wife was in the back.  And he said she liked it back there because she was alone, got to be away from the sons. 
[02:46:00]  And his son wanted to watch a movie.  And the guy says to me, can I borrow your laptop for my kid to watch a movie?  That's what I'm thinking, right?  And two things go on, which is one is I want the kid to shut up for the flight.  Second thing is I have to write today.  Am I going to take a nap?  I'm so tired.  Maybe I'll give the kid the laptop.  But then I'm thinking, what if there's porn on it?  Then where have this kid's hands been?  He's 11.  He's just starting to jack.  Yeah, fuck that.  So his hands are covered in his own little pre-spooch.  So then I go and I give him my laptop. 
[02:46:30]  Then the dad goes, oh, let's not watch this 80-minute movie.  Let's take out Harry Potter 9.  So he puts in a three-hour-plus movie.  The kid doesn't get to see the end of it because the battery died.  And now I get this little post-spooch little thing.  I Purelled it.  I got to the hotel, and I just vaccinated it.  Here's why that father's a cocksucker.  Because he lets him, first of all, his wife doesn't like it back in coach.  He probably only had enough, there was enough tickets, and he took himself up in first.  And then he fucking wants to help have you entertain his shitty kids. 
[02:47:00]  Well, in his defense, he kept asking the flight attendant that he wanted to switch and move back to coach.  Oh, okay.  He wanted to be so he could be in a line with his two sons.  And his kids were cute, especially the heavier set one that wanted to jack off to my web.  But I think he was both.  I never would have done that.  No.  Now, you don't ask somebody for their laptop.  It's like saying, can I borrow your testicles?  Yeah, that's like your personal fucking everything.  Because they've been on your laptop.  I wouldn't give them my laptop if this kid was having a fucking heart attack.  It would help them.  My kid's going to die. 
[02:47:30]  Well, sorry.  Here's the instructional DVD of how to save your son from a heart attack.  I'm sorry, you can't borrow this.  Sorry, I'm watching a movie.  Would you have been polite, though, Jimmy, when you told him no?  I would have said, look, sir, I would have said, there's things on here that nobody should say sorry.  Right.  Under no circumstances would have gotten my laptop for his fucko kid.  Are you a Mac guy?  A Mac guy.  See, that's the thing, too.  If you open one application, everything, there's too much erasing of history to go through.  You open one QuickTime file, and then it's your grandmother and a cat. 
[02:48:00]  Well, not if you set it right.  You've got to set it so that there's no open recent option.  There are ways to go into your settings.  Oh, I hate open recent.  I hate open recent, too.  Oh, man.  It's real bad if you give your laptop to an 11-year-old.  Here, open this up.  That's my mother.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't fuck around with that stuff.  I never let anybody use my computer.  God, you're a nice guy, Bob.  I was very nice at that moment.  I thought about it.  I don't know how many people that would do that.  I don't know how many people that would do that.  I don't know how many people that would do that.  I don't know how many people that would do that.  I don't know how many people that would do that.  And you said yes.  How presumptuous. 
[02:48:30]  It was a moral dilemma.  Did he have headphones for the kid?  They'd be borrowing your fucking earbuds.  What a creep.  And by the way, why did he just...  I gave him a bottle of lotion, too.  Why didn't he just get something from the flight attendant?  I'm sure, didn't they have, like, the portable thing?  Not on this flight, no.  This was a weird one.  It was one of those planes that doesn't have all the new stuff.  So, you know, the ones that are cheaper, and you're in first, so you're still in first,  but it looks like a coach seat.  But it's not really first.  And there's no frills. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  And they give you just the...  U.S. Airways or Delta.  One of the U.S. Airways things.  Going to Cleveland.  It has an air vent, and it has, like, pretzels with that horrible...  It's the worst mix of snacks that they could put in one package.  It's peanuts, pretzels, and some peppery shit that just tastes vile.  Well, it's like...  And you have to be dying.  Look at us yelling at first class.  Hmm?  Look at us yelling at first class.  Sam, when you fly first class, it's annoying, right?  Even coach.  No, I've never actually flown first class. 
[02:49:30]  I don't...  What?  I can't relate to that.  Why is that?  Oh, excuse me.  Let me just move closer to you.  Yeah, please.  I didn't realize.  Here it is.  It's the...  Tickets cost a lot more money.  That's true.  Do they?  Yeah, that stops me from...  What about for your honeymoon?  Do you think you're going to do that?  No, we're flying to Hawaii, coach.  Can you upgrade?  What?  Do you have any mileage?  I don't have any miles, I don't think.  How do you fucking take coach to Hawaii?  He has to.  Like 12 hours.  You don't remember those days?  Hey, coach isn't that...  Coach isn't that bad.  People have to do that.  Hit up the fucking parents.  Yeah, you got...  Hit them up.  Say fly first class, bitch. 
[02:50:00]  It's like 12 hours.  No shit.  And coach...  Where are you going to go in Hawaii?  Maui and Kauai.  Are you going to be in a room or is it too expensive?  Yeah, what are you going to go when you sleep at me?  Yeah, I've got a tent for them.  Sleeping under a rock or something.  Got a really nice car.  Yeah.  Running a Hyundai.  So what do you got planned?  Are you going to do the helicopter tour?  I don't know.  She wants to do like a ripcord through the jungle.  Nice.  You do that.  And I was like...  Oh, the zipline.  The zipline, yeah.  Yeah, I did ziplining.  I don't want to do that at all.  It's fun.  It's great.  Zipline.  It's so high up. 
[02:50:30]  Empty your bowels before you do that.  What do you mean?  It's above the trees.  50 feet?  Yeah, if you fall, you'll be dead, though.  You're not going to fall.  They've got it figured out.  They don't have anything figured out.  If a plane falls out of the sky, you're dead, too.  It's way more dangerous to fly to Hawaii than do a zipline.  I doubt that.  And I trust a pilot of an airplane more than some guy.  The most dangerous thing is driving in Hawaii.  That's the most dangerous thing you'll be doing.  Oh, man.  Are they bad at driving?  Well, everybody's drunk.  The tourists are all just driving drunk.  They think they're in New Orleans.  Oh, man.  That's what you've got to be careful of. 
[02:51:00]  Have you been there a lot, Bob?  Yeah, I love Hawaii.  I've never been there.  Why?  I've spent a lot of time there.  Besides the obvious shit, I guess, that it's beautiful and looks nice.  I like roasted pork in the ground.  I just like the air, and it's pretty.  You can get in the ocean.  Is there a comedy club there?  No, I don't.  Is there a game there?  Uh-uh.  I feel like it's just too far to travel for nice.  I go down to the Caribbean, man.  Yeah.  Oh, L.A. makes it easier.  Six hours from L.A., right?  Yeah.  See, it's like 12 for us.  And I like Cabo.  Cabo's nice, but you can't go in the ocean.  I like Cabo, yeah.  The ocean undertow, they say, pulls you in. 
[02:51:30]  Really?  In Cabo, you can't go in the ocean?  You're not supposed to.  I think people do, but people don't care.  I just hung out on the beach with these big Mexican guys that had bandoliers with shots in it, tequila shots.  They just sat there drinking tequila like crazy.  It's looted.  Looted.  I'm fucking zooted.  I'm just selling a lot of beach.  What is zooted?  Like, zooted?  Like, fuck, snotted.  Snotted drunk. 
[02:52:00]  Hammered.  Hey, you want to hear from John Travolta's accuser?  Yes, I'm dying to hear from this guy.  Well, it's the Royal Caribbean guy.  The cruise employee explains what John Travolta did to him.  He's like a steward.  Like, he's not a masseuse.  Exactly.  He's just a guy.  But John Travolta...  Stuart!  You mean this is a guy that...  This is the third guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two masseurs, and then this guy that was just minding his own business on a cruise ship because  he's working it, and John Travolta hit on him, right?  Oh, he did more than hit on him.  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:52:30]  Well, according to this guy, yeah.  All right.  He told me...  He told me...  Oh, no.  He told me...  He told me that Fabian, oh, I have something on the neck over here.  Oh.  And I thought that was some simple things, maybe.  I don't know, but he asked me.  So I said, sir...  Is this a problem?  It's okay.  You're okay.  You don't have nothing.  Okay.  So during that time, he took out the bathrobe. 
[02:53:00]  It was white.  He took out the what?  The bathrobe.  His bathrobe.  Oh, a bathrobe.  Oh.  Oh, a bathrobe.  Batrock, I thought he was...  Yeah, something like that.  His bathrobe.  It was white.  It was white.  And he got naked in front of me, so he gave me a big hug.  Oh, boy.  And I was shocked.  And I was shocked.  And I couldn't move.  I mean, on that moment, I realized that my career was on a big wrist.  Would you be traumatized if John Travolta drops his robe, he's totally naked, and then he 
[02:53:30]  just hugs you?  I would laugh my ass off.  I would be traumatized.  I'd be like, naked John Travolta's hugging me.  There's rules.  This is cool.  I would just go through all the good scenes of this movie.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  With a retrospective.  It would be kind of cool.  I don't know if guys can be traumatized like women can.  But it's great.  I don't understand that.  The guy is not a masseuse.  So John Travolta's still like, hey, could you rub my neck here?  And the guy's like, I guess.  Yeah.  Look, I get it. 
[02:54:00]  It's awkward.  And it's kind of a hassle.  But to be traumatized by something like that?  You thought John Travolta's penis, naked penis, pressed up.  I swear to God, I would laugh my ass off.  You think it's true?  I would openly laugh.  I wouldn't be traumatized.  You think guys are just coming out, though, because other guys are coming out to say this?  Maybe.  Just because it's a fun piece of TMZ crap.  Well, I don't know.  John Travolta, we've all heard rumors.  What about Joey Travolta?  Oh, man.  Never happened to him.  Wait, who's Joey Travolta again? 
[02:54:30]  And his brother?  Yeah.  What?  Yeah, right?  I forgot that he had a brother.  Yeah.  What did he do?  Maybe it's him.  That's what's maybe going on.  Oh, man.  What is he?  Wow.  Remember him?  No, I don't remember him.  This is freaking me out.  I kind of do.  Was he in shit?  Was he in stuff?  I think he was in a masseuse.  Joey Travolta.  Is he an actor?  Napa.  I remember him.  He did something.  I can't remember.  Was he in Staying Alive or something? 
[02:55:00]  Was he?  I have no recollection.  Go to IMDb, Sammy.  Bite your face.  Joey Travolta.  He co-wrote the theme of People Scare Me.  Normal People Scare Me.  Oh, what happened to the talent?  Enough with that picture.  Get another one.  I know.  It's a younger one.  We might remember him.  Yeah.  I got a younger picture, Sam.  Oh, yeah.  You wouldn't hear about Richard Dreyfuss doing that.  He acted in a lot of stuff.  He tried to touch me.  He had a white robe.  Like what?  Sunnyside.  Splash 2.  The TV movie. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, boy.  That was really good.  It's about Natalie Wood.  Simon and Simon.  Hollywood Vice Squad.  Oh, I like that one.  Hollywood Vice Squad.  Yeah, I like that.  What's his writer?  What's his biggest thing?  Being John Travolta's brother.  Oh.  Three Ninjas Kick Back.  What?  Beverly Hills Cop 3.  Oh, Amazon Women on the Moon.  Oh, yeah.  I've seen that.  Do you want to hear more from the accuser?  Oh, hell yeah.  He has a very soothing voice.  I would want him to touch my penis. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He's relaxing.  Now he's hugging him.  Naked.  Fabian.  And this guy is worried about his job.  Would you be freaked out?  No, I'd be laughing.  I would be laughing.  Bob?  I would be laughing, but then I'd get away.  Yeah, you'd be like, all right.  I'd ask for a picture.  You fucking kook.  Can I take a picture with you before you rub your fucking fat pole on me?  You think he has a fat pole?  Yeah, I know he does.  Yeah.  Fat, wiry ass hair.  Or you rest your balls on my face when you sign this to my mouth.  Yeah. 
[02:56:30]  Pick him out and start singing Grease Lightning.  Go Grease Love.  My Pulp Fiction.  Oh, you could do Pulp Fiction lines, yeah.  You do a face off.  Would you touch my face like you did in the movie, but with your cock head?  Would you do that annoying move with your genitals?  That was Joey Travolta?  Mm-hmm.  What year was that?  78?  Wow.  Was he a singer?  Yeah.  He sang.  Oh, he's tempted.  Do you know that song?  What's his big hit?  Go on YouTube.  Find him.  Get his big hit.  You know he had a hit?  I think he did.  Yeah.  Really?  I think he might have.  Did he sing that song, My Brother Likes the Cock? 
[02:57:00]  Is that him or no?  I think that was him, yeah.  Grease Lightning is a reference that would come to mind.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Grease Lightning.  It's a Grease Lightning.  Well, they had to, during the rehearsals, when he kept saying it's a real pussy wagon,  they had to keep telling him to stop saying yuck.  This is a new album.  Oh.  And the single is...  For the Mike Douglas show.  Jesus.  I worked on that show as an intern.  If he says it's going to be a hit, I value his opinion, because he knows what he's talking 
[02:57:30]  about.  Would you do your new single for us?  Sure would.  Joey's for both of them.  Oh, boy.  No, I'd rather not do my new single.  Yeah, I'm busy.  I'm going to drop a deuce, Mike.  He's wearing the Saturday Night Fever suit, by the way.  This is great.  I love these old Mike Douglas clips.  I have a Mike Douglas question when we're done here.  Oh, yeah.  I filled out cue cards for him once.  It's like a scene from Boogie Nights. 
[02:58:00]  It really does.  Look at that hair.  Where's the cards?  We don't know this song.  You might know the cards.  Nothing's like a Jew?  What did he say?  What?  Come on.  Bring it on home.  Nah, you got another verse.  God damn it.  What a wimpy song.  This is horrible.  He's like...  He's wispy. 
[02:58:30]  What a breathy douche.  Maybe he had whooping cough.  Yeah, he might have had whooping cough.  Yes.  He's trying to save his voice.  Look at that set.  Wow.  That set is great.  He should do a talk show from that set.  He's the stage.  He's the charisma of a fern.  I never heard of it.  The masseuse sang this song.  Yeah.  I want to go, but I can't stay here no more.  I worked on that show for six months.  I was an intern.  Were you there when Pryor was there?  Uh-uh.  Okay.  Pryor did an interview.  Yeah. 
[02:59:00]  I knew we did critical condition with him.  I forgot you were in that.  No, I said you did.  I thought you were in it.  No.  Wow.  I was not.  I should have been.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I definitely forgot you were in it.  No, I said you did critical condition.  Three people came up to me and said that they were in it.  Wesley Snipes told me, and I forgot.  So I thought you were just telling me.  Boy, I really made you twitch.  I'm sorry.  I wish I was in that.  Was I?  Oh, no.  I was in critical condition.  You worked on Mike Douglas.  That's kind of cool, man.  And I did three weeks or about a month with Pryor in North Carolina. 
[02:59:30]  And so I'd gotten close with him a little bit as a stand-up before that.  But I got bumped one night at the comedy store because Richard went on, and he felt bad,  so he took me outside on the sunset to show me his new Testarossa.  Oh, great.  Thanks.  And I had no spot.  You know, I was just depressed.  He went, you want to get in it?  I'm like, not really.  He goes, yeah, no.  Just a quarter million dollars.  Oh, shit.  Sorry about your spot, man.  Yeah, no shit.  That didn't help.  It kind of did in a way just because he, I don't know. 
[03:00:00]  Pryor.  It was Pryor.  Wow, that's kind of cool.  And he was just, nobody was like him.  A few people.  You know, you look at him and people that are great now.  There are a few great people.  So he would sometimes not do well because he was scared.  He would be on stage, but I just couldn't believe.  It was like another level.  Well, when he's working on material.  Yeah, which is inspiring that you can throw the whole thing out, which is what you're supposed to do.  And he would just go up there and bomb.  And bomb.  Or he would get a standing ovation at the top and then.  And, but then a few weeks later, he would obviously figure it out and then start to kill. 
[03:00:30]  So you, I totally forgot that you weren't in critical condition.  A lot of people do.  It's a lot.  I was not in Apocalypse Now either.  What was the first thing that you were actually in?  Were you in a movie that was significant for you?  I had one line in Spider-Man.  What was your line?  He stinks and I don't like him.  I've had very little significant work.  When you say, Jib, what are your works of significance?  My answer is they're yet to come. 
[03:01:00]  There's nothing wrong with that, brother.  I know.  But after 22 years, you should have something you've contributed.  They're yet to come.  Something that is lasting.  That was just sad.  Do you want to hear the second clip from this guy?  Oh, please.  All right.  John Travolta.  His accuser.  Right here.  I could feel his erectus penis.  Oh, no.  His erectus penis.  He could feel his erectus penis.  His erectus penis.  He knows Latin.  Yes, erectus penis.  Gladiators.  I could feel his erectus penis frothing on me. 
[03:01:30]  He's raping a dog.  I couldn't remove, you know.  And suddenly I told him, sir, I removed him, not in a professional way.  And I said, sir, this is wrong.  What are you doing?  I said, sir, I must go.  This is wrong.  I don't want to be right.  All right, all right.  Oh, hey.  Yeah.  Well, whatever you might need again, let us know.  OK, OK. 
[03:02:00]  So he stand up quickly to the bed and like, hurry, Fabian, Fabian, Fabian.  He was talking to me.  And I said, sir, and he said, Fabian, don't say anything.  Please do not say anything.  And I will take care of you.  I promise you.  I promise you.  And I will give you $12,000.  So please come back tonight.  But do not say anything.  I knew he was forcing me, abusing me, just because of. 
[03:02:30]  That's Mr. Travolta.  I was a victim because of his power, because of his name.  He's so powerful.  I was a victim.  A victim.  A victim of his penis.  12 grand.  His erectus penis.  You would take fucking John Travolta's penis to your thigh for $12,000, wouldn't you?  Yeah, but he was asking for sex.  Holy fuck.  To just hug him, though?  No, he looked like he was going to give him the money after it all went bad. 
[03:03:00]  He wanted to give him the $12,000 for him to come back later.  Oh, well, no, I wouldn't do that.  According to this guy.  I would not do that.  I would take his penis to my thigh, though.  How much?  You would?  You would actually take money and let a guy put his penis on you?  Oh, fuck.  I'd let him slap him between my ass cheeks.  Really?  Yeah, and leave pre-cum all over.  How much to have sex with John Travolta?  Nah, I'm too rich for that.  You'd be like, okay, Jimmy, you're happy.  Now you're a cunt.  Now you're a cunt.  Yeah.  Even if you don't have to tell anyone about it?  Nah.  I'd want to frolic on the beach with him a little bit, like in Greece. 
[03:03:30]  A little bit?  I'd want to frolic.  Oh, yeah.  You'd have slow motion footage?  Yeah, if he fucked me, then I'd want to commiserate with Stockard Channing.  I just want to reenact that movie.  Tell me more.  Tell me more.  What's his asshole all red and shaved?  Fitty suck on your cock.  Tell me more.  Tell me more.  Fuck.  That's the one we needed to do.  Now, you know, is this guy making this up?  Is this guy bad acting?  Or was it not Travolta? 
[03:04:00]  I think this shit's happening.  Yeah.  And you also said you would do it for 12 grand.  Well, no.  Just the fucking penis on my thigh.  Just touch the dick on the thigh.  Let's slow down here.  That's it.  And you probably would talk about it on here, so you wouldn't sign the disclosure.  I would do it as a...  It would be a goof.  I'd laugh my ass off.  Even if it was a rectus?  I wouldn't be a victim.  A victim.  How would you have picked him?  Because, you know.  Oh, man.  You know, you hit on one guy masseuse and everybody talks about it. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  See?  And he wasn't even a masseuse?  What was that guy?  Just like a cabin boy?  He was like the steward.  The dog trainer.  The guy that comes in and fucking gets you your shit.  Yeah.  And he just couldn't fucking control himself.  No.  John Travolta was like, I'm naked and erect.  This guy's famous now.  Yeah.  Today was a good day for him.  Did he get some coverage?  Summer lovin'  Ham and no pants.  Summer lovin'.  Please leave the room. 
[03:05:00]  Yes.  Summer lovin'.  Summer lovin'.  Ham and no pants.  No, you don't know what that is.  Summer lovin' put his fingers in my ass.  I met a steward crazy for me.  I met John Travolta.  I think he had VD.  Oh, look.  He's singing to a girl.  How unique.  What was he?  Vinnie Barbarino?  Well, well, well, yeah.  Tell me more.  Oh, what's going on over there?  You getting the Billy Bob Thornton autograph? 
[03:05:30]  I'm just giving it to him when he's here.  Is he here yet?  Is he here, Roland?  Thanks, Roland.  Very cool.  Vinnie Barbarino.  Didn't he used to do it?  It's like dice stuff.  He used to go, oh.  Yeah, dice.  Yeah, yeah.  Dice.  Yeah, right.  I don't know.  So is that guy asking for money?  I don't know.  Oh, that sounds like a setup for fucking...  I am a victim.  When you say you're a victim...  That's lawyer talk.  Yeah, yeah.  You need some money.  You definitely need some cash for money.  He's a victim of his power and money.  That's lawyer talk.  A victim.  Yeah.  Well, he knew who he was, so he goes to the movies, apparently. 
[03:06:00]  Well, the first guy, his lawyer dropped the case because he got his date wrong, which  makes it tough to try the thing, of course.  Because he wasn't even there.  I am erectus penis.  It's always a problem.  Husband to a murdered wife.  Father to a murdered son.  Spartacus.  Erectus pest.  Beyond there lies the penis of my Travolta.  Yes.  Yeah, he had an alibi.  He was in New York at Mr. Chow's.  Yeah.  But your defense is that you just weren't in town at the same time.  You're kind of saying, I may do this. 
[03:06:30]  But then the guy's like, fuck, I just messed up the date, but this all happened.  And then the lawyer's like, well, good luck to you, buddy.  Go find another lawyer.  And he could be telling the truth, but that makes it tough to fight that shit in court.  Scientologists got to the lawyer.  Yeah, pretty powerful, those Scientologists.  Or Scientology is a little mad at Travolta.  We brought up that.  I thought, I've heard that theory.  It's a theory that Travolta wanted to leave the Church of Scientology and that this was  actually them showing him exactly how they could damage him. 
[03:07:00]  Why would he want to leave?  I don't know.  But I mean, and then I said this yesterday.  Again, that's just what I heard.  And then all of a sudden you see the charges get dropped by one guy.  And now this is going to be settled privately.  So it's going to go away.  It looks like it was about to explode.  I just think that's good.  Actually, good publicist work when people do scathing, horrible things about you.  Why are so many people concerned?  Why does anyone give a shit if they don't involve someone's dick?  When I came on this show, I don't know how many, eight years ago, whatever it was, the 
[03:07:30]  world wasn't like this.  I mean, TMZ wasn't on the air.  You guys would be an outlet for people to go and talk about some bullshit that's going  on that we heard.  And everybody talked about it and made jokes about the famous person that got called  out and he's gay and she's not and whatever.  But now this is tame.  Because this is on your news.  I mean, it's like, this would just be for the back alley, this shit.  It's so fucked up.  They talk about, you know, the gay marriage and the president came out and supported it.  We're all happy.  Everyone's happy. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, you support gay marriage?  Of course I support gay marriage.  And then, like, the second John Travolta might be gay, everyone's like, I gotta know.  Let me know.  What's everyone's secret?  Like, who gives a shit?  And people, I mean, if a man pays a woman, you don't hear that news unless the woman got  pregnant or something.  Yeah, or they're married or some shit.  Yeah, or something.  Yeah, that never happens.  But if a man just wants to jerk off with a friend, all of a sudden it's a problem.  And you meet somebody, then you're a victim. 
[03:08:30]  But he's a nice, subtle, sweet guy.  He almost sounds like Jose Jimenez.  Jose Jimenez.  He doesn't know anything.  I know nothing.  He's a sweet little guy.  Yeah, he's hairy.  This guy sounds nice and gentle, this guy.  He probably went into Travolta's room, right?  He starts folding the towel like a little monkey on his bed to make the little monkey.  And he's looking for John Travolta's sunglasses to put it on the towel monkey.  And then John Travolta walks in.  Hey, the witch is the robot.  All right, all right, look.  I got my robot. 
[03:09:00]  Next thing you know, he's naked with his penis.  Hugging him.  The monkey.  There you go.  Systematic.  Yeah.  I can't remember any of the lyrics.  Otherwise, I wouldn't say it.  Well, this is Pulp Piction.  What great music.  He slams the door.  Sam left the studio.  I was going to tell him about a zipline thing.  So he would go ziplining.  Yeah.  Because Sam is a monumental flopper.  Well, there's a story in the Daily News.  Flesh-eating bacteria claims Georgia woman's leg after zipline accidents. 
[03:09:30]  What happened?  What?  How'd that happen?  Her name's Amy.  She spills it all nice, too, with a heart and everything.  What was the zipline accident?  Sam, you're going to be fine.  The headline in the paper, flesh-eating bacteria claims Georgia woman's leg after zipline accident.  How great would it be if they came back from the honeymoon and they both lost their legs to zipline accidents?  Oh, my God.  None great is the answer.  They have to have the apartment fucking printed with wheelchair stuff.  It's good if you have it on the other side so you could still chain your good legs together. 
[03:10:00]  Do a potato sack race.  How'd he get this?  From zipline.  She contracted a rare flesh-eating bacteria.  Well, what happened?  How did she do it?  I don't know.  Where?  I'm going to guess the zipline accident took her to the hospital where she got infected.  Right.  The young woman was kayaking with friends along the little blah-blah river in Georgia when the group went ziplining with a homemade rope.  Oh, see, they did it on their own there, Sam.  So what happened?  When it was Copeland's turn, the line snapped and she fell and cut her leg. 
[03:10:30]  Doctors speculate she could have come into contact with the common bacteria from the water where it then entered her body through the gash.  I like that.  Say that line again.  Yeah.  Gash.  It entered her body through the gash.  Through her gash.  So could you get rid of that immediately?  It's in the water, the flesh-eating virus?  It's everywhere.  You can.  There's shit right on our counter.  Yeah, this place definitely has some viruses in it.  Yeah.  Oh, Captain, they put creatures in our bodies. 
[03:11:00]  He put his penis in my gash.  Erectus penis.  You're going to get married when?  In like three weeks.  June 2nd.  Who's performing this ceremony?  My dad is.  That's nice.  What?  You didn't know that?  He got ordained to do it?  Well, we have to.  Sort of.  Yeah, we have to kind of.  Not really.  We have to get a justice of the peace to observe it.  And then it's all straight.  What kind of fucking farce is this?  I don't know. 
[03:11:30]  I don't know.  Shit.  What kind of loophole?  Do you take your dad with you on the honeymoon?  Yeah.  Yeah, he has to observe that, too.  Oh, his dad's going to get all choked up.  You take my son?  Oh.  My boy.  Sam has a very close-knit family.  You be good to my boy.  You take my son?  My son puts his penis in your victim.  No, he'll be.  Why does he have to be part of it like that?  Why can't he just be your dad and sit there?  And walk you down the aisle like every other father-daughter?  Does he like your fiancé? 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  And Jess saw him marry family friends of ours.  And she suggested it?  And it was her idea.  No, it wasn't.  It absolutely was.  She hates the thought of this.  She wants her traditional wedding with some guy with a collar up front.  Is that a buzzkill at all?  No, physically.  I mean, it's weird, right, Bob?  I don't know.  It's a little weird, Sam.  It's silly.  She doesn't want a collar because she's half Jew, so.  Really?  Is she a dog?  I'd fuck that out of her.  Yeah.  Oh, you meant a collar.  Yeah.  He said, we're going to break a glass. 
[03:12:30]  Mazel tov.  Yep.  How much?  Hmm?  How much?  How much?  Because it costs.  The glass?  Yeah, when you break it.  I don't know.  That's part of the expenses.  You've got to talk to the event planner.  I don't know.  Glass itself.  I don't know.  You went to half black chicks to half Jew.  That's right.  Wow.  I don't see things that way.  Do you want to tell your listeners where you're getting married?  Yeah, I'll just announce the venue.  It's in Connecticut, right?  If anybody wants to come by, feel free.  I can't believe you're going, like what? 
[03:13:00]  Are you going to let it?  That should just be, well, I'm feeling much better now.  Oh, yeah, you've got an RSVP.  Jess has been asking me if you're going.  You've got an RSVP.  You know I'm going.  Just put me down.  Are you?  Do all the guys go?  Put me down.  But then you've got to get a room.  You've got an RSVP so we know what you're eating.  I need a room for.  Drive back after.  And the honeymoon, when do you leave for Hawaii?  That's not until August.  August what?  Oh, you're not leaving the reception and going right to your honeymoon? 
[03:13:30]  We're going to go to Bermuda for a couple of days right after the wedding.  And then the real honeymoon is Hawaii, and that's in August.  Tried to schedule it so we didn't take a long vacate.  Because hopefully it'll be when the show's on vacation.  What have you saved?  It sounds like you guys are just tigers in bed.  I know, right?  What have you saved for the wedding night as far as sex goes?  What have you saved?  He has four quarts of semen in a pickle jar.  I didn't mean it that way.  He gets to take the fucking condom off now.  Is that it?  And I'll let her fuck me in the ass. 
[03:14:00]  Wow, that's sweet.  That's nice.  That was a quick one.  Did your dad listen to the show?  You take this pussy boy to be your lawfully wedded husband.  You're going to take the condom off?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you're going to have unprotected sex?  Yeah.  With her?  First time ever?  No, no, no, no.  Can you keep a rod in a condom?  First time in a while?  Is it hard?  No.  No?  No.  Jesus.  What about an ass?  No.  Not at the moment.  Well, no, never so far.  We're still very young, aren't we?  Well, it doesn't matter. 
[03:14:30]  We're very young.  What does that mean?  Why does...  Yeah.  We are young.  What does that mean?  Fuck you, asshole.  You haven't learned what that is yet?  But Bob, we said ass sex is for the young.  Yeah, exactly.  It is for the young.  It really is for the young.  If you have a charm bracelet on, you should never take a dick with it.  The shit falls out.  No, we have...  You don't want...  After you pull your dick out, you don't want it to look like a sea urchin you just touched.  Shrivels up and closes.  Yeah, it sucks back in.  Sea anemone.  Yeah, sea anemone. 
[03:15:00]  That's an inverted...  That looks like an inverted anus, a sea anemone.  Yeah, yeah.  They're terrible.  You got our SVP, though, because we got to know what meal you're eating.  Your segues are astonishing.  I'm going home.  See, your ass went inside out.  I got to know what meal you're eating.  Yeah, I know.  He's the best.  That'll be chicken, steak...  I'll have the steak.  Fish.  Just write it down.  And there's a silent vegetarian option.  For...  Seriously?  I wish they all were.  You just got to tell the waitress.  That'll be some kind of zucchini thing.  I don't know what it is.  Some medley. 
[03:15:30]  Some shit medley.  Some crap.  Some fucking butter mixed medley of vegetables.  Vegetarian dishes suck.  They're fucking horrible.  Now, I'm allowed a plus one.  And I like that souffle.  It's like Stouffer's.  Oh, it's horrendous.  Who should I bring?  Hmm.  That's a great question now.  I'm a single guy.  So who should I bring?  How about that nurse that we just listened to?  What did that guy do?  That penis guy?  Yeah.  That guy.  Bring Fabian.  Bring Fabian.  Oh, man.  I should put your erection on his thigh.  Drop this suit, he had penises, erectuses. 
[03:16:00]  Penises, erectuses.  No.  I got to think of who I'd take.  You think it'll be a female?  It'll definitely be a female.  Well, then shouldn't you get a room, then?  I don't know.  What's the age of consent in Connecticut?  Oh, that's great.  I'll look into that for you.  Why are you laughing, Bob?  I don't know.  I swear.  Would you take, like, a 15-year-old?  I'm thinking.  No, not 15.  We should have printed that on the RSVPs, I guess.  Just so everyone knows.  So here's the age of consent.  What is the age of consent in Connecticut?  I'll find out.  I have to know.  Are you dating a very young person?  Could be. 
[03:16:30]  They have a locker?  Yep.  Could be.  Is Jim's picture in it?  Yes.  It's signing the law.  By the way, I'm really happy to see you guys.  I'm happy to see you, too, Bob.  Well, Bob, it's been a while.  What is it?  Whoa.  Well, I'm assuming the close-in-age exemption will not apply.  That's how it'll apply yet.  What is it?  What is it?  I hate the close-in-age.  Minors under the age of 16.  Sexual acts.  That would be Jim and me. 
[03:17:00]  No, I know.  That's three years older than they are.  Right, right.  16 years old.  No, I'm going to get out.  No, no.  The age of consent in case, 18 in certain scenarios, I'm assuming you'll fall into that scenario.  I've probably fallen into that scenario.  Such as when the older partner is in a position of power, such as non-school teacher.  Oh, there's that in power.  Athletic coach.  That doesn't work.  Or some other position of power.  That's not a position of power.  No.  What's the age of consent in Connecticut?  Come on.  It looks like 18. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  That's what I think, unless you have a...  That could be an issue.  Can you get a note from a doctor?  No, I got one for being sick.  16.  It can't be 16.  It's not 16, Sam.  There's no way.  If it is 16, my realtor's got to get right on this.  A total of 31 states have set their age of consent at 16, the lowest age of consent in any state.  Have Kenny check.  But there's usually an age differential between the parties.  Well, all you have to do is print this out and show it to the cops.  I looked this up on the web. 
[03:18:00]  It's right from the internet.  It's 16, unless you were old enough to vote for Mondale when he ran for president.  Piece of shit.  Fucking Jimmy.  Bob Saget, thank you.  I'm leaving.  Thank you.  I'm leaving, too.  BobSaget.com for your tour dates.  Yes, sir.  That's coming up very soon.  Bob Saget on the Twitter.  And then I'll shoot a thing, a special, and then I'll come back. 
[03:18:30]  And then, bye.  Very good.  Wow.  Quiznos.  Quiznos.  I actually want one now.  That was a really good commercial.  Liked that, right?  Yep.  See you tomorrow.  I need a solid stool.  All right, let's get out of here.  We'll see you tomorrow.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  Finally, the moment is at hand.  After opening, Anthony Lott is coming up next.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </pre>
