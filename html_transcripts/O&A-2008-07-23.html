<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Anthony detailing a debilitating illness, characterized by a high fever, nausea, and intense visual disturbances.  He recounted a near-fainting episode in the bathroom and Jill's well-intentioned but ultimately disastrous attempt to comfort him, resulting in an accidental testicular punch.  Listeners called in with their own illness anecdotes and diagnoses, creating a bizarre, impromptu WebMD session.  Speculation about Anthony's condition ranged wildly, from tuberculosis to cancer.  The show also covered the impending cancellation of their Buffalo show due to Citadel's financial struggles.  News of Christian Bale's arrest and his role in *American Psycho* sparked humorous speculation.  The hosts satirized Zimbabwe's hyperinflation, discussed a lottery-winning doorman, and reacted to the death of Estelle Getty, interspersed with *Golden Girls* clips and contrasting opinions on the show's humor.  Patrice O'Neal was a guest throughout much of the show, contributing to discussions and promoting his upcoming appearances at the Opie and Anthony "Virus" tour.

The show continued with a discussion about hitchhiking, followed by more on Estelle Getty's death and YouTube tributes.  The hosts and Patrice O'Neal then debated John Kerry's use of the term "tar baby," with callers offering varied perspectives.  An interview with Amy Sutherland, author of *What Shamu Taught Me About Life, Love, and Marriage*, proved contentious.  The interview ended abruptly after an offensive comment about Sutherlandâ€™s appearance led her to hang up.  Further offensive remarks followed.  Brief mentions of P. Diddy's video blog and David Caruso's acting career concluded this segment.

The next portion featured Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, Patrice O'Neal, Randy Couture, his wife Jenna, and Amy Sutherland.  The show began with mockery of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's new film, followed by more promotion of Patrice O'Neal's stand-up.  Listener feedback on Sutherland's book, criticizing contradictions in her advice on marital behavior, fueled further discussion.  Crude conversations about bodily functions, particularly bowel movements, ensued, leading to a plan to powder Sam's (identity unclear) hair.  Randy Couture was interviewed about his book, *Becoming the Natural*, and his upcoming fight with Fedor Emelianenko,  analyzing Fedor's fighting style.  A caller shared a humorous anecdote related to Sutherland's advice.  More vulgar discussions of relationships and sex followed, along with continued discussion of the media's coverage of Christian Bale's arrest and more criticism of Sutherland's book and interview style, including further crude and sexually charged comments.  The final portion focused on Couture, his training methods, fights, and opinions on other fighters, along with jokes about his intimidating presence and his wife's fighting abilities;  an underwater fight was also mentioned.

The show's final segment featured Couture, and two other guests, "Poe" and "Mars," discussing MMA versus street fighting. Couture argued that a trained MMA fighter could easily adapt illegal techniques. Poe's initial comments about Couture's wife created an awkward atmosphere.  The discussion included frequent interruptions, comedic asides, and offensive comments.  The segment featured analysis of various MMA fighters, graphic descriptions of fighting techniques and injuries, and eventual apologies from Poe and Mars to Couture and his wife for their earlier remarks.  Couture promoted his book.  The hosts discussed listener emails and Amy's reaction to the previous day's events and her decision not to return. The segment concluded with further banter and offensive jokes, including references to physical attributes and crude humor about listeners and Amy.

[00:25:00]  from page it says they're calling him bad man holy pow batman star attacks ma batman arrested  uh they all the headlines apparently christian bale uh in england and gotten a little tiff  with his family and um but no one knows why no it's a family matter i would think  he was questioned for four hours and released and they say he was arrested which conjures an 
[00:25:30]  image of the police getting him cuffing him and bringing him into the station well they they said  they wanted to question him and he went down to the police station and sat down and england has some  wacky rules over there because he had to post bail but was released with no charges like how does that  work what kind of wacky judicial system do they have where it's like all right then post your boo 
[00:26:00]  well what did i do nothing right well he talked to him for four hours and then they let him go so  this is a non-story but it's on the front page of the paper here in new york city do you think he  talked like this the whole time i didn't hit my mom that's why it took four hours he really  it really could have been wrapped up in like 20 minutes but it was slow dramatic low talking we were  speculating on the radio yesterday that his mom probably said maybe too many times how great  he's ledger was as the joker oh he smacked his mom because that's all everyone is talking about as 
[00:26:30]  far as dark night goes and christian bell finally had it just gave his mom a good talking to with his  fist he overheard them when he walked into like a little area i thought that he was the star of  exactly he's got to be frustrated that he's he's still living and all they're doing is talking  about heath ledger and how great he was as the joker uh here's how one of the hey mom this is  susudio right uh here's uh how fox five in new york is teasing the batman story tonight on fox five 
[00:27:00]  news at 10 see this have your umbrellas ready i've got some storms to tell you about what's coming  and when plus batman arrested tonight at 10 you're the news asses this isn't the soup on e you idiots  batman arrested there is no batman you idiot no there is the stupid news you're the news  that is something that would be uh on the news in gotham city batman arrested oh my goodness what 
[00:27:30]  will we do they're held in high regard you're supposed to like report the news the actor that  played batman was arrested batman wasn't arrested you idiots i was file trading with pete townsend  right for research oh the superman in a wheelchair that's right yeah exactly  and then uh this is all we know and bail aka batman busted arrested for assault just days after the 
[00:28:00]  london premiere of the blockbuster movie the dark knight noah levy senior editor at in touch weekly  gives us the inside story a lot of people are saying this was not a physical assault but this was a  verbal assault bale who plays batman in the dark knight is accused of allegedly assaulting his 61  year old mother and 40 year old sister in a london hotel room the night before the movie's lavish london 
[00:28:30]  opening lavish he's been compared to elvis costello but i think huey has a far more bitter cynical sense of  humor despite playing a crazed psychopath in the 2000 film american psycho bale reportedly does not  have a reputation as a hothead christian bale did play such an amazing role in american psycho and you  really have to think you know was this just acting or is he really a violent guy you know i'm not really 
[00:29:00]  sure for his part the 34 year old actor has denied any wrongdoing so because he was in american psycho  they're basically saying that he could be a psycho a psycho right  poor heath ledger oh cowboy sucker right dead from drug overdose  that's the same thing of course it is you're the news report the news they keep showing clips of 
[00:29:30]  american psycho on tv which is the best part of this story which is just gives me a chance to see more of  that great movie that movie gets better and better every time you see it too and yeah you know what  i learned i really thought christian bale was close to 40 years old he's only like 32 34 something like  that pretty young guy but he was 20 or 21 years old when he made uh american psycho yeah that's crazy i  never saw it i always thought he was like in his mid 20s because he's just if anyone else played it it  wouldn't be good at all but he's just such a lunatic in it it's one of the rare cases where i actually 
[00:30:00]  read the book yeah yeah and the book is so my gerald my my friend from who wrote it from the comedy  seller yeah he's uh he's a little gay fella and uh he said i felt like i needed a shower after i read  it and that's the best example that's the best example of what that book is it's so vile yeah yeah no  way it i know the movie can compare it with the book it won't and it doesn't do the car battery  stuff in the book no where he takes the car he has two two hookers tied up and he takes a car battery 
[00:30:30]  and let's just say there's there's a place on your chest where you'd never want a car battery hooked up  right and he hooks it up on this woman wow and uh oh he does awful things or where he puts the habit  trail and allows the rat to run in dude no they don't do that they tamed it down for the uh  yeah the big screen way tamed it down but just you know what don't even try to compare it to the  book just watch it on his merit because he's just he's insane and it's great the the the way he plays 
[00:31:00]  that character in that movie yeah how about the nail gun in the mouth uh did a little nail gun  no it's a nail gun scene but uh nothing really no payoff really no teeth knocked out and then maced  and then a nail gun put in the mouth pg-13 this is great what did disney make the movie oh yeah  yeah let's say hi to marty marty hey what's up guys hey thank you marty marty what year are you in  right now marty wait i'm uh 2008 really you you have to go back to 1955 uh i didn't get those mikey's 
[00:31:30]  that they were selling and tell disappointed tell the professor about the flux capacitor  okay thank you marty i will now what do you have for us i heard uh christian bell actually  told his mom that don't stare at it eat it okay that's that's not bad let's go to steve on long  ounce from the movie yo what's up guys hey man did anybody think that maybe he was in costume when he 
[00:32:00]  did it come on he's in his underwear he's just got the mask on he turns around kicks his mother  and sits in the knickers gets to the window and goes i'm kiss um all right listen someone's saying  that uh christian bell was 26 when american psycho was made i thought younger all right 26 makes a  hell of a lot more sense hey anthony was uh teasing the zimbabwe dollar zimbabwe zimbabwe 
[00:32:30]  zimbabwe zimbabwe zimbabwe yeah there's a few ways you can say it i guess yeah whatever cares  savage nation it doesn't matter how you say it i'll never be there it's one of those places that  is just a uh a horrid place say on the surface of this earth an asshole yeah well of course well  this they came up with this uh yesterday zimbabwe has introduced a new 100 billion dollar banknote 
[00:33:00]  but it's only equivalent to one u.s dollar this new bill is enough to buy four oranges officials  are trying to ease recurrent cash shortages that plague the nation the country has been suffering an  economic meltdown since declaring its independence from great britain in 1980 why would you why would  you declare your independence from great britain you because you're independent you want to be  yourself you want to do this you want to be self-governing and you have no uh ability to do 
[00:33:30]  that there's warlords there's a civil war disease that can't be handled and the place turns into  a grapple that's what it is so they have a 100 billion dollar note which is good enough to buy  four oranges why can't they just call it a dollar i know it just makes everyone have to take a math  class to figure out crap because then their dollar would equal other people's dollars they have how that  works they have to show how worthless their money is by calling it 100 billion dollars just call it 
[00:34:00]  a dollar is it is it a dot is it called a dollar what's it called it's called 100 billion dollar bill  imagine if you just need like four dollars out of a hundred billion what what does that get you  it gets you a fleck of dirt in your eye if a hundred billion gets you four oranges  one billion doesn't get your crap what is 40 40 zimbabwe dollars zimbabwe dollars you have purchased 
[00:34:30]  one piece of spittle on glass slide the glass slides extra you gotta you gotta return it well they'll burp  certain sense in your face like you like the smell of yak they'll burp it into your face  for 40 of their dollars oh my god this is just ridiculous what how much it's called a share of  citadel stock well for 40 of their dollars they'll put a fleck of rainwater on their foot 
[00:35:00]  and plant it in your testicles and leave the marketplace happy so so if you have 10  10 of these 100 billion dollar bills how much is that well when does the math get so ridiculous  that you don't know what you're doing anymore you're you're on your way to being a trillionaire  is that trillion or do we have to go to that other number i think you need a thousand billion  a thousand billion yes is a trillion but inflation is running at two million percent a year which means 
[00:35:30]  the groceries you put in your cart in aisle one have gone up by the time you get to the checkout stand  about yeah exactly 30 percent heart quick oh yeah right in the back of your mule yes how about  the starving child holding a basket that you have carrying your groceries that he can't have on mom's  head let's uh say hi to luke in buffalo uh soon to be taken off of uh the fine buffalo radio station what's up luke  hey it doesn't matter i got xm baby hey do you think batman had to get bailed out

[00:43:30]  to do the lines a few times like it just she was terrible she would it looked like she was looking just  off camera reading her lines which obviously she was doing but it kind of went with the character  a little bit because you felt like you know you know what i mean it was an old old lady that's  kind of losing her mind a little bit that show made me laugh though man golden girls really made me  laugh did it well i couldn't stand this goddamn show yeah why don't we all bats hold on we're revving

[00:47:30]  the other side of what the listeners do they think they're being funny and stuff and they they  boo a comedian and then you know it messes up other things so i think we're gonna start taking  our events out of out of new york because i think they're just they're getting ridiculous but when a  guy who sucks is one thing but like giving a guy one second and then just attacking him when he when  you haven't really seen what he's doing it's like you're not gonna get real comics real comics animals  it was a bad move man a bunch of people decided to boo before they even saw uh you know dan 
[00:48:00]  natterman's act and then russ and silly and and russ maneeve who's a who's an animal he's a great  comic and so we wanted russ maneeve on the tour he said f you not f you but he said no way and  there's two other guys that said no way all because of what happened at the animation festival and and  they weren't even bad comics so that's what we're dealing with behind the scenes we ought to just  station face punchers in the crowd and the second someone starts booing they just get like some guy  kenny size to just punch him in the face and go okay here what were you booing about 
[00:48:30]  and then i'm sure it'll all be over then after that oh be fantastic and then somebody else on  the other side decides yeah boom boom bam and he gets slammed in the face and before you know it  everyone's listening but they're not laughing they're just sitting there afraid to get punched  well the boors at the animation festival they really put us in a uh a bad position yeah thanks  the guys didn't deserve to get booed i mean no of course not the guys you got are uh the show is

[00:50:00]  wow he died it was like it i don't even know how what what psychopathic idea that is but yeah it's  gotta be a problem to do that but he died and i was like well yeah and then i watched that performance  and i understand even all that that he was going crazy stuff because he really brought us  a psychopath feel to the joker man like that all that laughing i was like how did he change this into  not a funny a fun guy even though he's laughing yeah i mean he was a nasty guy man he was psychotic 
[00:50:30]  he was a serial killer in this movie oh just amazing it was the dude was uh he was in the zone man yeah  i bet you he's one of those guys that no one talked to on the set you know just one of those creepy  method he probably went deep deep into method acting man he was stabbing yeah yeah pencils he  was great i was reading an article of gary oldman after uh they did a scene said wow that's that's  reminds me of a clock you know clockwork orange and uh he goes funny you should say that i've been  watching it in my trailer that's uh you know all day long something like that yeah and one of the 
[00:51:00]  articles i read with that six chicago accent he had as a killer did you catch it oh he's ledger  he had chicago he was yeah listen to it if you see it again he's chicago that's chicago man he was  being being a chicago dude he was great well well gotham city is chicago yeah it's chicago it was  great man i didn't even know he's australian until i heard him in a real interview yeah i did not know  he was australian he guy's great tremendous who knew christian bell was from wales he's got a 
[00:51:30]  uh pretty uh deep accent when he's i didn't know where he was from but i knew it was scary yeah we  had a problem with the whole oh but like i said if you was if you wasn't say if you was a superhero  but your alter ego worked on broadway and you had like a little sissy lisp you would have to figure out  a way to be the dark knight if that was a like he was a he was a gallivanting uh millionaire he's  like a billionaire but that was how you should sound as the dark knight sound like a little kid 
[00:52:00]  disguising his voice that's what he was you don't know who i am do you how about wearing a full mask  stupid don't even have your face out that damn he's that that movie i didn't have any problems with  that movie except for i i don't want to insult this person right away but i mean maybe white eyes are  different i don't i can't under this the second movie in my life where third maybe where the woman  was so bothered me her look bothered me so much that i it almost brought me out the movie for the idea 
[00:52:30]  that two of the biggest characters in the movie were were dying over that harvey two-face turned into him  because of the pain and suffering of this mess die like if she's not pretty enough  yeah let's she just wasn't pretty enough to be careful drive the movie i don't right i don't  want to be careful the spoilers because we promised right we promised uh the audience that we would  she's not pretty enough to you're talking about maggie uh gillenhall i don't i don't understand 
[00:53:00]  fisher she's princess leia she looked like princess leia she had she had a she had saggy old face with  with youth it was bizarre it's just the strangest it margot kidder and superman 2  oh the only other thing that to this day i want to punch the tv i wouldn't give up um a piece of  my pinky nail let alone all my super abilities to marry that mess pruny lip friggin old 
[00:53:30]  bitch oh was she disgusting oh and yes superman gives up all his powers just so he could sleep  with her i think i think lasek or something yeah it goes around the world a few times to make time  go backwards to save her and i understand you want to take your glasses off because you don't  want anyone recognizing you but maybe some contact lenses would would work she had green kryptonite uh  panties yeah he was losing his mind she sucks do you think you think that christian bale watches 
[00:54:00]  batman and then says why didn't anybody tell me how stupid i sound maybe his mom did that's why he  punched her in the face like he's watching his ledger like just be immersed in this role and then he  walks in i gotta catch the bad guys where's my speedy car he's like i'm a douche there really was  a drop off between the two oh damn but i'm sure they pumped up his voice in post though you know  the the effect you think i think so it was just i don't know the movie's good though was it was 
[00:54:30]  the best movie you've seen in a while there patrice no he's ledger's performance one of the best  ledger was tremendous one of the best performances uh i've ever seen trying to put him up there with  hannibal lecter i think that's ridiculous but in terms of comic book villains he is very high i'll  tell you who uh just takes the uh acting uh trophy there the uh oscar i believe will go to morgan  freeman who uh just plays a great version of morgan freeman yeah that son of a bitch cannot play 
[00:55:00]  a different character he is he's become the jack nicholson of black men he's where he doesn't have  to be a character anymore but he's not interesting enough plays the same role in every every movie  huh morgan's morgan's not he's he's nicholson was a weird guy he is the morgan freeman's your name  your neighbor that won't shut up that just goes on with this monologue i disagree and i have to  i and it's not because he's black he's not i don't care he has a distinguished way about him where 
[00:55:30]  every role that needs this dude they get another dude was to play it he would have to play it as  morgan freeman where i'm not gonna do this but he can't get he can't play any other role like they  can't put him in anything have you ever seen street smart it was not that good as a pimp are you not  well you turned jimmy on to that you saw that he's the one played the great because you're a white guy  jimmy i am wait a minute but white people want to see dig it baby he played a real pimp he was the 
[00:56:00]  best pimp in the history of movies i don't like the fact that patricia made it where i can't not like  morgan freeman yeah i know i didn't i just didn't like his performance that much i thought it was  like i really did dude you got to see street smart that's that's the movie kytel did a great  pimp in taxi driver he was great kytel did a great pimp he was a great pimp but you got to see street  smart jimmy did he didn't like it i just saw it like a month ago i'm not going to let you not like

[00:58:00]  in a movie before she died so we could appreciate it yeah she was in stopping my mom will shoot no  that's right i forgot about that wow classic she was funny in that damn show i thought the show was great  i hated golden girl hate golden girl it was one of those shows that when i'd hear that freaking theme  song and i knew it was coming on i'd have to change the channel as quick as possible i didn't want  i could why would i care what four baby powder smelling old hags down in florida are doing while 
[00:58:30]  they're talking about sassy sexy things never so that means you only watch the show once or twice  no no i've seen it a few times but you watched the show i was forced it because it was one of those  ass girlfriends i was going out with at the time liked it so i'd have to sit on the couch and and  watch it ru mcclanahan as a hoe i thought it was be off it was so phony over the top unrealistic  ru mcclanahan some friggin geriatric hoe she's the first cougar she's oh shut up who's banging her 
[00:59:00]  oh yeah how is she dragging so many men home with that old dried up prune we like a little reality  yeah how about some freaking reality she had a sexiness back then did she really and then and  then her hair was blue there was that thing we listened to patrice blue hair we listened to  earlier estelle getty uh uh yeah no we're playing it right now yeah we'll play that but this is so 
[00:59:30]  unrealistic we really want to make a lot patrice patrice we uh yeah we we got some uh samples from  golden girls that this is the sexiness that we found a perfect perfect scene here of what this dumb  show is all about unrealistic uh estelle uh getty of course she played sophia and here's  what she's doing in golden girls hi ma what you watching i don't know one of those steven spielberger  movies that's not a steven spielberg movie what are they doing you know what they're doing we had 
[01:00:00]  that talk when you were 12 i can't believe this you rented a dirty movie dirty is in the eye of the  the beholder okay maybe that's a little dirty  they're all ladies what what old hag is watching a movie like that  some this is some maybe not her not in that house not with the the rest of the old bags 
[01:00:30]  well if we're not going to suspend disbelief what guy in a half a mask and bat ears is running around  a city flying that's a fantasy yeah that's that this is supposed to be comic book this is supposed  to be comic book about this old bags living together you want your sitcoms to be actually  authentic completely real no but it makes it sound like she's like swallowing cucumbers yeah what's  she doing why was she i need to know why was she watching it yeah what was she building up to 
[01:01:00]  is she really someone coming over or was she going to take care of herself you picked i know you  picked all right that might be the worst clip in history no there's so many other we continue here  ma we did not get a vcr so that you could watch dirty movies i'm 81 what are you worrying about you  think i'm gonna find someone down in the center to do that with it's not a bad line yeah what are you  talking about am i gonna find somebody to bang it's all right at least that made it realistic  you gotta be thinking of the the face too when she's delivering the whole why would you ever 
[01:01:30]  want to think of that face these are old ladies i can't i know why would i want to watch a show  about old ladies because they weren't represented they were represented really funny and it was it  was really well written and it was just fun to watch them oh yeah it was great they were all  completely different from each other there was the old lady who was kind of cranky but then you had  like kind of like the uh the the the lesbian mannish vibe of b arthur you had the slut and room  mcclanahan and betty white was a dummy completely the opposite of what she played in uh what was  she in uh mary tyler moore where she was a castrating monster she was i thought they were great all 
[01:02:00]  let's go on here how's the stress look on what's the difference in half an hour be crumpled on the  floor next to an empty bottle of jack daniels so he's getting banged i can't we hear that one again  because i missed it oh come on this is so stupid how's the stress look on what's the difference in  half an hour be crumpled on the floor next to an empty bottle of jack daniels an empty bottle  an empty bottle of jack daniels did she just smash room glenahan yes that's funny that she's going 
[01:02:30]  to get drunk and late oh it's just how do i look in this dress in a half hour it'll be crumpled on  the floor next to a bottle of jack daniels that's a great line oh an old lady to slam i think you're  an old war you're just being a curmudgeon right now dude that's a funny line when you're feeling  better you'll be like it they're the original sex in the city girls yeah the girls they're all  just sassy ugh i like the golden girls something about something about old women they the older 
[01:03:00]  they get their faces start looking like the uh their uh you know what just droopy i don't know i was  more a uh well let's let's let's family ties guy me too before he started quite looking for attention  i knocked them over again we get it michael a moldy clumps that's what steven s for basher is  saying here we go another uh little line from the golden girls was she the youngest  you know rose i'm really enjoying this you and i having a quiet cup of coffee together 
[01:03:30]  me too sophia because i said quiet  that's kind of funny that's funny dude what are you doing her banging woke me what are you talking  about the toilet seat mom four women live in this house the toilet seat never has to move you always  manage to make it back forgive me sweetheart why don't you just get me a little box to keep next to 
[01:04:00]  my knife what's wrong with that one look there's some funny lines you're gonna laugh dude that's  just hilarious all right there's a funny line box to scratch come on man these were all funny  i'm sure uh hit loud a few laughs in his nuremberg speeches you gotta look at the you gotta look at  the overall sit story though yeah you know you're positively sure that joseph mingler was hilarious  at one point in your life i think a couple of laughs here and there but you gotta look at the 
[01:04:30]  overall picture it wasn't as funny of course you would have asked you a mussolini was boy all the  tickles what's the matter with you i think not that that's not a crazy example to raise during the  golden girls that hitler might have been funny that's a perfectly logical direction to go with it  i think that the law we're getting random lines from a couple of them and they're all they are funny  lines i'll give i can't deny it i can't deny it yeah i mean was charming there's one more i have a 
[01:05:00]  better idea we can hitchhike see i can lift up my skirt you know like in that clock gable movie it  happened one night boy we'll have a ride in no time please you lift up your skirt and someone might  mistake your thigh for the on-ramp to the freeway well fat thigh i guess and a whore  the on-ramp to the freeway do you know how many people use a freeway i'm sure they wanted to write  a tunnel joke this is making me want to go buy the uh no it's not really just to sit through the 
[01:05:30]  the box set of golden girls funny it's funnier than most of what's on today network it was fun  for two minutes and all four of them are great actresses like they're all four not a weak link  in the show yeah whatever stop it her all whatever what show on that's on today that's not just say  just say you miss us today huh just say you miss a still getty no just say you miss her no this  guy does though listen to this this is an emergency blog 
[01:06:00]  i have very unfortunate news  this is where now we're gonna start doing some positive for what i have a bunch of friends  now you want to hear some comedy now we're gonna hear some comedy a stupid blogger by the  way hold on an emergency blog enough of us criticizing the golden girls the two the  gay voice he said and the two of us buttheads getting to an age joke of course  of course now here comes the comedy people 
[01:06:30]  i have very unfortunate news for everybody  if you ever saw the show the golden girls you know sophia as like the funniest character  she passed away this morning july 22nd at 5 a.m so i've heard  i always knew she was like a sickly woman i just didn't know how sick she was 
[01:07:00]  that's like my favorite show and now that she's gone like i know they canceled it and everything  while ago yeah 16 years ago she was like the funniest character on that show  like every day i watched it on lifetime at four o'clock i gotta put it on  i'm like i don't know why i'm crying so much but i can speculate yeah because you're a sissy right 
[01:07:30]  doing an invitation of your dad yeah  because dad never accepted you are you idiot oh why i'm crying so much but i just wish i got  to meet her because she's so funny  what's that awful music he's crying her and dorothy and rose and blanche 
[01:08:00]  but sophia was always my favorite  sophia estelle getty which is her real name this video is for you and your memory  you'll always be in my heart as one of the funniest people i've ever got to see on tv  you imagine if that's your legacy is this fruit leaves you a message and thank you for being a  friend 
[01:08:30]  rest in peace you're in my heart that's what you've worked all those years for to have that  mary leave a youtube message did you hear at the end thank you before thank you for being a friend  the whole the whole thing of that was him to get to that that yeah dramatic line like oh we get it  now when gary coleman dies i'm gonna go hey man the world don't move  just one drum peace out 
[01:09:00]  that's what you gotta do when any one of these guys dies just take a bad line from their theme song  hey there's a bunch of these videos up on youtube we got to get them for the show  yeah there's more than one he had a different stroke  by the way uh this guy writes this fruit could still watch her she's still on tv it's not it's  not a personal freaking relationship she wasn't doing anything new she stays alive on lifetime  what's depressing though is that she was really old but at one point somebody had sex with her and 
[01:09:30]  said i banged estelle you got that estelle yeah she's an animal like maybe  1950 oh had to be way back somebody pumped drinks in her because they had to get in her pants yeah  i'm going for her over there estelle no way no way you get that she's a goer all right be my wingman  what's a wingman planes haven't been invented yet front and back same time yes yes let's go to

[01:14:00]  with its original programming i am hooked on this show the first episode i was totally hooked the  characters in it are hysterical uh disgusting um some of them are just blatantly racist is it a  comedy or drama it's a drama it's it's a it's probably the most accurate depiction of what 
[01:14:30]  the hell goes on over in iraq uh it's it's the guys that were going in uh leading you know leading  the way the marines uh during the uh operation um iraqi freedom and uh the it's just not like  you're it's amazing what has happened to war movies and war shows they've just become so much more  realistic carrot and character driven where these guys are just like they're just guys they're just 
[01:15:00]  guys that are doing it's not like all right bring the armor up and we'll like the old days it's just  these guys like you know someone will ask a question i throws his shoulders up like i don't  i don't know i saw the first episode too it was great the opening scene to the series was just  amazing yeah really good up stuff all over the desert know what i found uh interesting and maybe  we could talk to some old soldiers they said that man look they didn't even clean up uh from the last  war like they they showed the desert yeah it's all crap from what 19 yeah because there was in staging 
[01:15:30]  area in kuwait right so they were like you know they didn't even clean up from the last war it's  just a bunch of crap they left laying all over the place and it got me to thinking i guess they never  do clean up that stuff that stuff will just rot there for hundreds and hundreds of years who the  hell's gonna decide to clean up all that crap in the last war in the middle of a desert we get covered  over with sand and just be part of the uh the history the history friggin layer cake we got a lot of  fans that are watching the show joe what do you got it's john but close enough all right 
[01:16:00]  that show is pretty great the the racism jokes that go back and forth and then it's not just white on  black black on white it's like redneck oh and then yeah they hate the rednecks and then the rednecks  uh just rag and the mexicans and the blacks are on the mexicans and the whites and by the way that's  reality yeah as much as they are trying to clean up broadcasting and all this other crap the  reality is we all make fun of other groups and that's what it is and it's not any of this bad 
[01:16:30]  stuff where it's like oh my god this is awful why are they talking like this it's just this is the  way it is right and they're depicting it the way it is this is how groups talk when no one's watching  them yeah and you can get away with it because you're not doing it in humor it's only people only  feel safe attacking yeah when it's being done in humor in humor that's why it's just such fraudulent  it's just amazing it's also a book uh i guess is it ah that dumb reading though ah screw the  reading this is great yeah you watch actual you know war footage and stuff one of the other really 
[01:17:00]  funny parts of that movie is when the reporter asked the guy for the picture of his girlfriend  he gave him oh yeah oh i passed it on and that guy passed it on to three others yeah they keep  passing it around to use it well a picture of your girlfriend over there is like porn that's for  everybody that's pretty much it and then there's some hard ass uh uh sergeant major that is so  goddamn funny he's like not not supposed to be funny uh he's just such a hard ass and they're all 
[01:17:30]  yeah they're worried about a war and he's worried about the width of their moose moustaches  yeah and whether they should go over the edge of their mouths and he keeps just ragging these guys  about the length of their moustache you look like a dirty hippie definitely just a southern uh lifer  it's definitely worth a peek great characters uh funny in a lot of spots and uh really exciting 
[01:18:00]  and they use the same font that they use here in new york city for this radio station by the way  oh right that's the same font with the the little crosses and generation kill  yes yeah yeah we ought to look to get a couple of these guys on because this shows uh  roland's working on it huge i think we're gonna have a few guys next week actually let's go to  north carolina better watch it then jeff what's up oh by the way it's uh it's the same guys that did  the wire yeah no i know okay did we say that i don't even know and one of the characters what's 
[01:18:30]  his name from season two is in it of the wire uh docs uh yeah uh ziggy was the wise ass  brother giant penis yeah yeah his name was uh james something i think he's running the other guy  is in it from uh oz too uh he plays a reporter from rolling stone that's embedded with him  hey he's in oz the guy that got branded by um  oh yeah beecher yeah he was beecher  uh damn let's say hi to max in dallas before we move on max what's up hey what's going on guys 
[01:19:00]  hey hey anthony you were talking about how uh they they were complaining that they left stuff  over from the last war or whatever uh i lived in germany my dad was stationed over there we got to go to  france a lot and they still got a lot of unexploded landmines so for world war ii and you'd be sitting  there watching tv at night and they'll have on the news well another child stumbled through a landmine 
[01:19:30]  and got blown up kind of like put like barbed wire fence and a little picture of a skull and crossbones  there and it's just crazy man my dad used to go bunker hunting over in germany he'd have like a  miner's hat a shovel and rope with his friends and go down into the six feet line over there in germany  and one time a buddy has found a german motorcycle a bmw still in the packing 
[01:20:00]  but all right thank you max thank you max i think uh john carrey is uh i don't know is he in trouble  for this not yet first of all people are a bit confused by uh john carrey's uh choice of words  here's the clip quote clarified it but he didn't change his position a spokesperson came out and tried  to clarify it so i think john is uh trying to throw that big tar baby out there you want to lose you 
[01:20:30]  don't want to win of course barack obama to be successful but you know what he wants he wants  us to really focus on the real war on terror which is centered in afghanistan and pakistan  i don't i i i just a guy a little out of touch with certain pop culture slurs  i guess it's an old term yeah i'm assuming what is that what is the old meaning of that it's from 
[01:21:00]  brear rabbit what what does it mean it's a may i patrice hell no none of you gonna make an excuse  for tar baby do you know where it's from get over there it's from racism it's from racism get over  there so stop bring over there we all share mike go ahead tar baby is from the story of brer rabbit and  brer fox and brer rabbit is trapped when brer fox leaves a little baby fashioned out of tar by the side 
[01:21:30]  of the road and when brer fox stops or brer rabbit stops to talk to him the baby won't answer  so he punches it we don't care what it's really from star baby is a racial slur man it's a no in  the dictionary if you it's from the 1870s yes we know it's a different time we don't know we don't  i don't hold on i want to hear this so 1870s what did tar baby to a problem that no matter how  you try to solve it it only gets worse oh because because the tar is going to get all over you and 
[01:22:00]  he can't get it and he can't get it off the more you try the more you're just getting it on you and  he's not using it he's just out of touch of what it meant right he's not using it to be right nobody  knows that it's like a boondoggle he said tar baby stop brain tar baby we know we i appreciate the whole  history of brer rabbit but you know what tar baby means but why are you doing this i don't it's always meant  to me a problem that no matter how hard you try and solve it you're only just going to keep getting 
[01:22:30]  in deeper yeah okay all right sure stump right that's that's what it means he no i know that's  the old meaning but that that's not what you think when you hear the term thank you i'm not even a  racial slur yes thank you it is extremely racist in in this day and age but it's not even that bad  it's like it's like everybody knows he didn't mean it like that it's like come on he's a stupid  old senator with a wife who does ketchup nobody thinks he does ketchup quite well with  ketchup hey stop brain where's coon from alice in wonderland hey also it was also it was featured 
[01:23:00]  in the band movie disney's song of the south of course oh it was yeah it became racist yeah zippity  doodah  my oh my what a wonderful day this is nice plenty of sunshine  hit my way oh this certainly is  the days this is nice smell the fresh air my shoulder right it's the truth it's actual 
[01:23:30]  oh it was so fun and innocent it's a nice song  wonderful feeling wonderful day  nice oh that is fantastic let's go to michael connecticut who's with stunt brain michael what's up  hey i'm with stunt brain on this just because a tar baby is black doesn't mean it's racist  an eight ball isn't racist anymore than a tar baby is they didn't have any white tar down there to 
[01:24:00]  make the friggin thing out is that a uh a racist term a eight ball no no not if you if you call me one  yeah but can we get that going now maybe i can invent behind the eight ball be honored you know i  understand that if somebody could make that to be  it could be beyond a ball is i wouldn't take that as being a racial but tar baby  all right let's just listen to john kerry again now that we know what he's using here  quote clarified it but he didn't change his position a spokesperson came out and tried to clarify it 
[01:24:30]  so i think john is uh trying to throw that big tar baby out there you want to lose you don't want to  win of course barack obama wants america to be successful but you know what he wants he wants  us to really focus on the real war on terror which is centered in afghanistan and pakistan  no one heard a word he said after he said tar baby right after that they missed it he said because we  don't want people to get spooked all right right well it's scared of course yeah and and in context 
[01:25:00]  i'll i'll say this he probably the way he didn't flinch he probably didn't mean it of course not  why would he say that he didn't flinch of course not but yeah he has a big liberal he said it's not  like he said it's like he wants to throw that big tar baby oh god  and i'm tired of hearing the cackles of the moon crickets they bother me what did you say 
[01:25:30]  yeah they're loud they're loud oh god let's see i know and the porch these are really  oh my god man uh just a bizarre choice of words right there he could have used a million different  words in that sentence he lives in a different world it's a different world where you just when  you say well you don't understand tar baby no one says it no people in his life don't talk like that  what if he said i'm headed down to the haberdasher to get me some cigarettes you understand that they're 
[01:26:00]  old they're old money they're old political people they're not fun fun people say tar baby your  friends say that these are old people who don't even know that they're right i think yeah but i think  old whitey is uh way race more racist than uh young white nah they don't even know that they're  racist that age for certain like he'll say something like ah those people haven't been  enough he doesn't even know he is all right let's go to john in cleveland good morning once again to 
[01:26:30]  cleveland how are you john patrice hey patrice how many words are just absolutely atomic in your culture  um the n-word is unless jesse says it the tb now it's going to be called the tb what is that tar  baby well tar baby's really not atomic unless any any i don't know here's the thing that bugs me  though about white people it's like you join in with the racer dude you you know you sound like  you probably having trouble paying your bills and i don't consider you like somebody that can hurt me 
[01:27:00]  with any word it's somebody like john carrey you know that's a whole nother story but a lot of times  poor white people join into this you people we hurt you shut up there's nothing you can hurt me with  he's just a dude all right with that we take a break patrice o'neal everyone opie and anthony  we got patrice o'neal in studio today he was giving us good news about uh houston texas a lot of black  listeners in houston man i was out there everybody black come up say o and a o and a o and a i was 
[01:27:30]  like oh man that's how i realized this i was like uh i thought it was all uh fat boys from uh new jersey  but it's a lot of a lot of black not even like weird uh black people like you that you know not  black people like black folks you're talking about black guys that act right right black weirdos we  gotta we got a few gangsters you're talking few few legitimate um um african americans nice those are  not houston black people those are black people from all over the country who like to show the  fluent to see you those are all of our back yeah it was a big party in houston yeah they had a 
[01:28:00]  convention i was very happy about that man i was actually very happy yes sir hey uh what did you  think of jesse by the way jesse jackson yeah with the cutting off of the uh the uh you know what's  and the uh any through the n-word around dude that's that's what everybody does you talk about  people i mean please i'm i know i've had to say things about norton behind his back if they tape me  why i don't know what you say about things i don't know i'm not gonna tell you i don't say  bad things about you you yes you do no i don't you say them in my face exactly i say 
[01:28:30]  behind your back but i say nice things about you behind your back that jesse does what people do  everyone talks uh behind people's backs every single person live i'm playing with you you like  to think you're not the one they're they're uh they're talking about but that's not you know we  all do it yeah we just all do it and you don't and it's not even a lack of love i talk about my  mama sometimes like oh my mother just oh why i can't talk to her but it's like you know he was 
[01:29:00]  just doing i i don't even think it was that bad he was doing a matter of fact it might have been a  friend like that's how you talk about your friends like he's so stupid he's that it up he might it  might be something he said to him you know impersonal to him like it's like it didn't bother me that's  why why did the outrage go away really quickly it was just like it was just like uh because it was  black guys saying about another black guy that's just not fair but he's he has access to this guy  and he's talking about cutting his testicles off like it's like there's like a legitimate you talk 
[01:29:30]  about cutting the testicles off of the first black candidate in history isn't that like a secret  sir i mean it's like really why is that like nobody has any outrage there's like nobody nobody says  i think just like we're talking now they people basically understand context but look when white  guys do something you are the universal villains of the universe they're gonna come after you it's  just it is what it is what do you want it's your fault like like when you do something you got to 
[01:30:00]  come after you it just is what it is that's why you got to be careful we've never had to be careful  with language but i think now um people are trying to put black people into this language thing that we  never was in that's why they should be putting that just don't call white well leave the language  alone for everybody i think that's reparations basically i think we're not going to get money  so at least we should be able to say anything we want about you leave the language alone that's it  it's petty it looks silly it looks it looks second it looks i agree with you like it looks like what it 
[01:30:30]  is um i'm actually i agree with patrice now on this whole thing wow because i and it's not even uh  like agreeing as much as just you just got to take what what it is at face value there is a double  standard it's just the way it is uh if it's the worst thing we have to endure as whitey  ah so be it's fine that's what we make our living talking and it can it can cost you a job  yeah it's not just unpleasant it's when when it's going to cost you a career or a job because you say 
[01:31:00]  the wrong way you gotta watch out a bunch of elitists in the ruling class throwing a little bone to who they  deem to be the lower class yeah we'll we'll do something about that that's all it is but that's  what before the the the break that got what he was saying when that guy was talking to me that's the  thing white people are doing this to everybody there's like if a black person says white the  thing that bothers me sometimes is that look i'm not we're not talking about just some the dudes  the garbage men the guy you bump to into in the elevator there's a there's a white guy that we just 
[01:31:30]  named white that does bad things to everybody and they're willing to take white people's rights  away just to get that overall big brother thing going so that's that's what it is it's just like  nobody black is is stopping language but but when when uh you know no one black has ever like who  right jesse colin powell's son ran the fcc but no he didn't really he wasn't making the decision he was  terrible he really was come on man he was terrible yeah he was terrible i know he was terrible but i'm 
[01:32:00]  saying he wasn't making decisions i'm saying so it was the machine man that's that's what y'all have  to deal with like you said the illuminati you got to deal with is you can't say stuff that you could  say in the 60s shut up that's great if i'm a garbage man but the fact that i talk for a living and  i talk on the radio and i'm gonna get dumped out of saying something yeah or that's where it gets  frustrating i don't i understand the overall picture it affects us differently because we can lose this yeah  yeah but that's why tell me i can't say it in my car and i got a problem because 
[01:32:30]  or on tv you can't do certain jokes that was that was my thing with i'm is that the stance i took is  that as a as a as a black performer i got i really have no language barriers i can say pretty much what  i want sure and so for anybody black not to defend somebody who talks for a living when they'll eventually  they will come after me and say i can't say what i feel like saying and i i don't even know how to  not do that you know i don't know how to not do it so i'll be i'll be in trouble but as far as black 
[01:33:00]  people not fighting to repress language jackson sharpton uh somebody who actually works very high  up at cbs that stupid whoopie goldberg al roker snoop they all went after him all talk for a living  and they all wanted him removed for saying something i knew he said and none of them call out a guy like  jesse for saying something he means like like no one calls him at saying something under your breath is  who you really are right when you're caught on a microphone saying something that's the way you  feel and it boils down to double standard i'll do it i'll take it i'll say it because it is what it is 
[01:33:30]  but we you know black people get to deal with double we have to deal with double standard in terms of  breathing like what are you talking about true it is what it is if white people could make us breathe  different air you would it's like you can't say shut up i don't shut your face it is a double  standard it is but i don't want to be affected by it because it can it can cost me everything and  that's that's what makes me sick i don't care about it as an overall thing i don't want it to cost me my  job yeah let's go to phil in new york phil how's it going on a phil conners what do you got phil well 
[01:34:00]  uh it's just like uh take take if you saw like john mccain at his home and you heard something like  like oh john mccain hates americans like jesse jackson has a public image that he that he's  trying to portray and he just went completely against it well look at all dude look at all the  look at all the crap dog the bounty hunter got for a private conversation look at charlie sheen 
[01:34:30]  had to come out in a pot dog the bounty hunter was fired for saying unpopular things on a phone  message uh with his son and i and i know that that was an angry thing but privacy is not always kept  private it's it's fraudulent it's more than just an inconvenient double standard i'm going to give  you something too that that white people don't have that black people do have and again this is i  don't have an argument for why it's right or wrong black people have a black thing like do you understand  what i'm saying yeah we hear it's huge i hear you have a black thing it's like it's just like that black 
[01:35:00]  people listen to that and go i get it and white people will be too afraid to it to attack it on  on the level of what it is where black people go and we do that but white people don't have a thing  that i white people do we just but that's a human thing yeah to talk trash about somebody behind their  back yeah it might be a human thing but that doesn't mean it's right and they say it was right but it's  fine that he did it i have no problem with jesse jackson saying that and i really don't think he 
[01:35:30]  should have gotten in trouble for it i just want him to shut his mouth when it comes to somebody else  saying something that's it there you go yeah now now he really doesn't have a leg that's all i'm  saying but it doesn't matter he didn't have a leg to stand on after hymie town people let it go he  said it was taken out of context he said i only meant jews people like oh listen we got to change  gears we can go back to this in a minute or two but we got uh amy sutherland on our phone lines  she's a tough cookie this one oh absolutely oh yeah look out guys look out guys she wrote a book 
[01:36:00]  that uh that piqued our interest how to train men let's talk to amy sutherland amy hi welcome to  the opian anthony show how are you i'm good how are you uh the name of the book once again  is what shamu taught me about life love and marriage shamu now of course you mean uh the  killer whale that's right down there at sea world that's right well it's uh you're a tough cookie amy  what's that what's going on with this book seems like you're really taking men to task well you 
[01:36:30]  know the thing is is that i i wish i was a tough cookie i've always tried to be a tough cookie but  if i was using you know the um the way the trainers work now are are all with rewards and  you know they're like they're they're they're fuzzy and warm and nice to the old school trainers sure  sure and i'm i'm a new school trainer that's that's hilarious it's again automatically i'm 
[01:37:00]  gonna tell you what the flaw is in thinking you don't want to be the the controller that's the  thing women don't want to win you want a winner you don't want to rule the nest that's why you've  never met a happy woman boss because you don't want to be there you're angry about being a boss you  want a boss you want your man to be the leader do you understand this is why it's already flawed on a  prehistoric level why would you don't want to run your husband do you know why running your husband 
[01:37:30]  is not sexy because you don't want to be there doing it that's why it never works for a woman to  run things because you don't want to you look at your husband like look at his bum letting me run his  life phooey you have a you just have a loser for a man well but see that's the thing is that  this isn't about controlling this isn't about no okay animal training but you go ahead now you're  doing an animal training thing it says reward behavior you want ignore the behavior you don't 
[01:38:00]  want i want to hear how this how this works yeah i really well but that means i mean the first thing  you should know is that the the way this works the way trainers work now is they don't use punishment  they only use it say if the uh shamu is attacking actually they don't even use it in that case  either but um so what you do is lay off the punishment which means that you lay off things  like nagging so but that's not your see you gotta understand nagging is what you do right yeah but 
[01:38:30]  nagging doesn't work but see that's but see that you're already you're being and i i'm i'm again i'm not  angry i'm like this is passionate things for me i love talking about this stuff but immediately  it's it's a man's fault for think for letting you think that you're nagging would bother him  i dismiss my woman when she nags dismiss her because the only power she has in her nagging  is the power i give her it means nothing even her jealousy means nothing unless i tell it to mean 
[01:39:00]  something if she's jealous i let her know that the reason that it's working her jealousy is working  is because i'm allowing it to work is that the fact that i'm giving it some validation because  i love her and i go look i'll let you be jealous i'll let i'll go but i'll explain who this girl was  i'll explain what i was doing last night but if all i have to do is go and shut up what are you gonna do  ultimately see ultimately i can suck you through a wall ultimately you can't do nothing  see you're actually doing animal training of course because i'm the one that should be training 
[01:39:30]  you yeah i mean you know how it works you it's like the tuna is running the ocean tunas don't  want to run the ocean sharks run the ocean that's how the ecosystem works bravo patrice yeah we should  be doing the training not you shouldn't be training us well but that's why it's already going on i mean  people are out there training each other you got a boyfriend or better than others at it you got a  boyfriend pardon me i have a husband you gotta talk sexy baby where is this guy is he is he on your 
[01:40:00]  book tour with you am i what is he what i'm sorry i didn't understand you what where is this where's the  guy he's he's out walking the dog no so what are you suggesting with this book why don't you give us a  few examples well basically what he was just talking about is that if you don't want if there's  a behavior you don't want one of the best things you can do is ignore it which is how you know exotic  animal trainers work if they don't want the animal to do something that it's doing then they don't 
[01:40:30]  reinforce it in any way which is what you were saying but miss let me ask you don't and it's not  happening miss respectfully let me ask you don't you think like let's say you're in a relationship and  you find that it's not going the way you want it to you want to train a person i mean don't you feel  that if if the training isn't going where it should be isn't that not gonna like ultimately  not reinforce something because of what was once said but not yesterday like you understand  not not i'm not sure i totally understand but i think what you're saying is that timing's important 
[01:41:00]  no no that's not at all yeah what i'm saying is in the relationship if you're attempting to train  somebody is it possible that the training would be would be dragged out the wrong way and all of a  a sudden they're going well if i'm going to be trained well then who's not to train me yeah  yeah i guess so i mean the thing is is that you know i mean the what i wrote about can really it's  not gender specific right but that's missing my point completely that's missing my because i'm saying  it is gender specific do you feel that to train somebody it should be a reverse situation as well 
[01:41:30]  ideally yeah yeah well that's what we disagree but the thing is is that see you're thinking a  training is just that who that it decides who's in control but that's not what it was said though  because that that's not what we're trying to make the point it's about gender specificness  it's about no it's about communicating the well you know you're talking about your idea of training  what i wrote about is how you can use your behavior to communicate what you want but patrice i'm sorry 
[01:42:00]  go ahead you tell me no i apologize that's i was just it's essentially how using the ideas exotic  animal trainers use to get animals to teach animals what they want them to do without using any kind of  language any kind of english um this is using sort of ideas to sort of teach each other with our  behavior what we like and what we don't like you filthy slob what what so the the book is titled 
[01:42:30]  what bob kelly taught me about life love and marriage  patrice was raising some good issues though miss about the training i mean uh do you do you agree  or disagree because patrice is uh but the control the control thing though miss you you are trying  to control though that's the thing if you're trying to train something you're trying to control you're  not trying to to train a guy for for equalness or happiness you're trying to train him for your happiness  but see that's all that's all old school kind of training right not the way trainers work now 
[01:43:00]  well but if you train a dog you're not training a dog to be your best buddy and on an equal level  you're training them to to do what you need them to do when you need them to do it that's what training  is yeah but i mean when you train when you get somebody when you communicate to somebody what you  would like them to do is that taking control of them uh yeah if if communication is not enough where  you go hey can you do this and he goes yes then when he this is training is when you say can you do 
[01:43:30]  this and they go no and then you have to figure out ways to get him to say yes and make your life better  so basically you're saying people should never change each other's behavior ever uh no this should  be a leader of the relationship yeah or just get a divorce and find a new one that might be more  compatible the way in your world the leader says what goes and that absolutely that's what happens  in the army does the do the do the soldiers tell the general what they think no they just do it 
[01:44:00]  and that's what makes the army or the navy or the marines what it is is because there's a leader  of the situation or the air force or the air force well i mean i don't know we're we're talking  two parallel universes i mean not really is it relationships are the same thing as the army  and the navy is just like attention somebody has a a actual place where they want you to be that's  the thing see you you there's a goal to what you're trying to do and what's that goal the goal is to 
[01:44:30]  communicate what you want to somebody yeah so that you get along better so that you're happier correct  right so that you're not yelling and nagging and you know scrapping and fighting and that's what a  lot of couples end up doing but it trickles doesn't matter who's in charge if people aren't  unhappy there it does matter who's in charge so why isn't your husband in charge you you're in charge  of him no i would disagree so what are you equal you've trained him though he's trained are you  training him um the thing is is that what i'm trying to say is that i haven't trained him and i 
[01:45:00]  haven't taken control of my marriage all i'm doing is using these ideas to communicate to my husband  what i would like him to do whether he does it or not is ultimately his decision can i ask a  question please could there's something i want to take issue with you maybe this you're saying  you're not trying to but it says one of your lessons keep your cool don't take an animal's  actions personally not even when the animal has left his smelly bike clothes on the bathroom floor  snapped at you for nagging to get a hearing test i mean don't you think that like with talk like that 
[01:45:30]  when you're discussing training that it's always going to come back to not necessarily bite the  trainer but also it just kind of it circles everybody whether you train them or if it's  not going to happen yep i i didn't follow that right no of course not because it's hurting your  point what i'm saying is don't you feel that if you're going to train somebody that it's going to  come full circle and not always bite the person being trained but also anybody who else is involved  because of that and how so how right exactly that's what i'm trying to say bite the person because 
[01:46:00]  that's not what we're doing here uh everything's going on you got issues sweetheart see the thing  is is that you know we're going to as long as you see this only is who's in control there's we have  nothing to talk about who you have no way to scream at me yes are you suggesting we raise a generation  of super husbands um you know i i really have nothing to say about whether husbands are in charge  or not because that's got nothing to do what with what i'm talking about so you see but here's 
[01:46:30]  here's the bottom line if you are suggesting and you have a book on how to train your husband  about how to train husbands oh what is it about how to communicate what you want to all the people  in your life using these ideas that i found hope it's wrong so it's not just about husbands to begin  with and um you know it's not what you guys are saying it is you're just reading the title and  deciding what you think the book's about oh well we're going by the little the synopsis too like 
[01:47:00]  what shamu taught me it's like a title does tell you what the book's about that's why we have titles  yeah because you don't want it just to be book number 15 721 the title has to tell you what it's  about like i had a girlfriend one time and uh you know she was as pretty as she thought she was kind  of a thin-haired girl with you know kind of chiclet teeth and big gums aggravating and i was always  trying to boss me around and i finally had to go you know what what the hey so would you rather be  bossed around or would you like to have somebody be you know say thank you and smile at you when 
[01:47:30]  they did things when you did things they like i would like it to be a partnership with my girlfriend  because she was always a good dresser she'd have sweaters and little red shirts and just massive gums  and little teeny teeth what's the matter i just saw a picture of amy  oh  comment

[02:15:00]  xm portion of the show we have that author on amy what's the name of the book again jimmy uh how to  train your husband like shammu's trained by trainers down at sea world yeah it's uh what shammu taught  me about life love and marriage and we gave her a great beating and her whole thing is to reward good  behavior and ignore bad behavior and we missed the obvious but michael s caught it he goes when amy 
[02:15:30]  hung up on you she completely violated what she was preaching she punished you guys her ideas are to  reward only good and ignore bad ignoring and hanging up is not the same thing so she when she went against  her entire uh concept for this book that she wrote all right  i'm literally i'm reading nothing says boring no no then making a point and then looking around the 
[02:16:00]  room and watching patrice eat and you proofread something i'm looking at uh rand i'm not proving  i'm reading randy's bio oh okay i'm thinking of uh i only proofread on breaks i'm thinking of uh  i think you were talking to a listener for some reason i think you were addressing a guy look it  wasn't gonna set the world on fire i understand but maybe maybe some acknowledgement that i actually  spoke i just thought you're right about that right uh and also jimmy fuck you why powder for that uh 
[02:16:30]  that little gag you pull with the listeners every morning i thought they were terrific i thought you'd  love to talk to them i i left cbs and i have like two eager fans just staring at me waving like  this and i go what the fuck is this and all of a sudden i get outside and they go jimmy told us  to wait for you oh and then i had to hear about worcester the whole time  and then we started listening to that yeah but then i moved down to jersey but i still stayed up 
[02:17:00]  in worcester and worcester is a great place but now i live down here because we're going to get  married and i go thank you jimmy thank you yeah i didn't mean it that's nice it was a good gag man  it's whoever gets out of there first usually can usher off the people that are waiting to the uh  poor last bastard that leaves i ran out of there absolutely all right we got the uh what the baby  powder for sam's hair oh yeah still getty uh dying at the age of 84 from the golden girls yeah and she 
[02:17:30]  had that big uh puffy um cotton candy-ish old lady afro yeah you know those white afros old ladies have  because you don't know what to do with that it's your gnarly gray hair so i just think a little baby  powder kind of tapped into uh can you put a sheet or something around it because i want it to look like  it's white hair you look old uh who's gonna uh apply the baby powder to sam's head all right danny oh  thank you no problem let me get your mic on there uh sammy thank you young sammy young sammy were you 
[02:18:00]  making a duty um i i was i was in there when my stomach was a little girl was it squeezing out like  toothpaste no what kind of consistency um actually consistency wasn't bad it's just there's just a  little like it was like soft serve ice cream like we're starting to pile up in the bowl a little 
[02:18:30]  painful um uh in the in the stomach really yeah i think because of the gatorade and robitussin and  all that all the other crap i've been taking with a doctor just make sure you're okay yeah let's get  up to the doctor blood test oh stop with your blood test you ever have a pencil thin  shit what's that about it's fun what is it it's just for fun yeah is there boulders in there that  are there's a there's a there's getting in the way and then then you can only like squeeze out pencil 
[02:19:00]  thin shits for a while it's the gunk on the side of your colon huh the gunk on the side no no then it  would permanently come out like that no it's all doodoo that didn't come out yeah yeah squeezing  through just like almost yeah but wouldn't every crap now be the same pencil you ever see toothpaste  when sometimes at the top it's just oh yeah some old two pages and then the the toothpaste comes off  in yeah that's what's going on and then and then eventually it goes and pops out well then you  gotta push it out but well then you gotta give birth to the uh the golf ball 
[02:19:30]  ball where you where you you're convinced that you're getting a lot uh accomplished and you'll  look in the bowl and it's like a golf ball size piece of crap and then everything starts flowing  again it's like thank you and there's milk duds have you ever been constipated and had diarrhea at  the same time like how is that possible no where it's just one will go and then someone go  and then someone go damn yeah all right why don't we put baby powder on sam's head 
[02:20:00]  and then we're gonna move on uh we got randy uh couture coming in today yeah yeah yeah he's  promoting a book uh becoming the natural my life in and out of the cage this guy is the real deal  and he's gonna be fighting who the jimmy he's gonna be fighting what's uh fedor said that  couture is the guy who wants to fight i just don't understand why you'd get in the ring with  fedor yeah just don't brave dude don't do it fedor's an animal i like couture and i think he's  tough but fedor could be the baddest dude on the planet did you see the fight over the weekend there 
[02:20:30]  patrice what when he dispatched of that giant 30 seconds so he's a great fighter man he's a  fucking a champion fedor is the baddest dude and he's like he looks like you could take him because  he's like a like a fat man he doesn't look like he's like a chubby yeah i know he's only like six  foot or something like that two thirty and he's uh but silva is what was six eight six eight two  sixty three jesus yeah he 30 seconds that fight lasted it's on youtube if you want to check it out  and he didn't just trip him up he fucking beat tim silvia to the ground like he beat him to the 
[02:21:00]  ground i have a problem with affliction doing their matches in a boxing ring i it's so much cooler  in that octagon fenced in yeah man i mean i'll i'll watch a good 36 second punching oh yeah i  agree of course but it's just the the show that uh the ufc puts on is just amazing fedor man yeah  just a dead face he nothing he doesn't even look mad it looks like sorry i gotta do this to you he's  like a a a really a portly ivan drago ivan drago oh he's just a machine must break you like eastern 
[02:21:30]  promises just walking around oh yeah that was it let's go to matt in uh his truck matt what's up  uh yeah i just had a comment about that lady uh trainer amy i thought that it's the lady trainer  yeah shamu trainer yeah um i thought it sounded like a pretty uh good idea to me um the way i took  it it meant you know when i do the dishes i get a blow job but when i come home from the strip club 
[02:22:00]  at three o'clock in the morning stinking my wife just shuts the hell up and doesn't say anything  about it and you're proud of that well no i think that that her technique sounds uh beneficial let's  say really reward you with a twat all right good enough all right man thank you uh i don't know if  this would be of interest to anyone but there was another guy that interviewed amy and he did it  differently he didn't challenge her on anything this is uh brian layler from wnyc you want to take 
[02:22:30]  a listen here see how much different it is brian i mean people were always asked if i was surprised  at how well that um colin did how popular it became and the thing is is yes i was surprised but  the original surprise was that the book about the animal training school the previous book um would  have such a personal effect on me i mean i'm a journalist i just went you're not an animal 
[02:23:00]  trainer right and i went to just hang out with this great subject of this top school for exotic animal  trainers and i left a year later personally transformed by that experience so remind our  listeners or for those who haven't read why is rich voss interviewing yeah holy jesus i thought it was  voss i'm like what how did voss cross paths with this one experience so remind our listeners or for  those who haven't read your article how did you first apply animal training techniques to your  marriage well so i was following uh students at the top school for exotic animal trainers for um 
[02:23:30]  my previous book kick bitten and scratched and so it's just i was following them as they learned the  principles and then as they applied them on actual animals you know hyenas baboons uh water buffaloes you  name it they had everything and it just really started to dawn on me that what they learned were these  fundamental principles behavioral principles that they were applying to all species so why wouldn't  it work on the species homo sapiens specifically american husband mine at home so you know i just uh 
[02:24:00]  this guy has to like live how great is it that we attack this cunt absolutely the american husband  i like to call them with her stupid big fucking teeth and dry lips i can't see my essence properly  big gums and little teeth yeah whatever guy has been emasculated he's still got to hang out with his  co-workers and his friends and stuff gave that up he doesn't give a shit you know i just uh started 
[02:24:30]  trying to unravel some of our or sort of uh solve some of our behavior problems between me and my  husband using the way the animal trainers would think some of our behavior like no not once is she  going to say here's my problem like yeah hell no fuck up is there uh should we continue there's one  more clip lion sack of cunt should we continue or what sure give me one example well the prime example  i mean um the really prime example the really sort of aha moment is that um when animal trainers work 
[02:25:00]  with an animal and the animal does something they don't like they will ignore it because the idea is that  any attention can fuel that behavior you don't like so um they call it they even have a term for it  jesus we we're all about bad behavior behavior you yeah and it would that would that would work if it  wasn't just all about instincts like you can't go when you're dealing with humans you just can't think 
[02:25:30]  20 i mean 100 instinctive it has to be no where person has to be involved we're even reasonable  reasoning beings even the great dog whisperer uh what's his name um oh what's that guy's name  oh that's right you like that oh he's a great dog whisper he goes you you you study the species then  you study the the the dog and then you study the uh the animal itself like it's still some principles  to she has no principles no she's like watching somebody train dogs and then just added the techniques to 
[02:26:00]  human beings but and then she's lying about how this shit doesn't like she's not trying to run the  relations she's a fucking asshole like but i'm not even mad at her personally all women are  fucking mad they're assholes they're all trying to do that sneaky bitches like it's just stop stop  caesar milan by the way caesar milan and guys who like this guy that called in  that's what women they have we have boiled ourselves down to just  twat awards 
[02:26:30]  fuck out of here thank you thank you for letting me stick my dick in there thanks  my fucking sex drive is disappearing by the hour  bitch needs to control me with something else it ain't no pussy no more i'll tell you that much  so um they call they even have a term for it they call it the least reinforcing scenario  because marine mammal trainers like to have names for everything chapter eight of your book the  least reinforcing scenario yeah on a fire dryer now is norm mcdonald 
[02:27:00]  so um so my husband uh loses things all the time uh primarily his keys  unfortunately not you hopefully they'll break cables to your  fucking car  things all the time his penis and testicles yeah it was in your purse you fucking overbearing  he left them at the altar when i went off the fucking animal camp and had my  asshole like by a fucking chihuahua for six weeks let's see how she handles the losing of the key 
[02:27:30]  scenario with her husband she's a treat yeah so um so my husband uh loses things all the time uh  primarily his keys and his wallet and when he does this he would have it would really you know  frustrate him and there would be a lot of stomping around and heavy sighing and all that and i had  always tried to help and if i didn't help i would you know offer suggestions of how this wouldn't happen  in the future but what the point was i was always you would rag him about it yeah exactly she would be 
[02:28:00]  like well you know if you kept him here you wouldn't lose him it's like i would offer helpful hint  that's not a fucking helpful hint do you remember when you last had him yeah we want to be talked  out oh yeah yeah yeah yeah i remember that's it thanks for fucking pointing that out yeah oh do you  know well if you put a clip on it or maybe if you left him in one spot all the time  yeah but what the point was i was always engaging so this least reinforcing scenario which i heard 
[02:28:30]  about it's holy shit now i get an instant feedback that came in about an hour and a half ago it's carol  miller to the person i was asking holy the interviewer sounds like rich voss she sounds a  lot like carol a little like carol because someone out of nowhere is like who is that dj that you guys  worked with at any w i'm like what does this have to do with anything but it just finally hit me  sorry that's the point was i was always engaging so this least reinforcing scenario which i heard about  at sea world made me think like that's where she should live one of those and not respond and that's 
[02:29:00]  what i did the next time my husband was huffing puffing over keys and it's not that he didn't  huff and puff but it like ended so quickly were you trying to get him to not lose his keys in his wallet  or to not be so upset about it to not be so upset about it that's the trick i mean that's i mean  that's the point of it is that i that's what i had picked i mean the man still loses his  who is this fucking cocksucker who gives a shit as a badger will always dig my husband will forever 
[02:29:30]  lose his wallet i mean it's almost like instinctive behavior how about you put a basket in your  cunt and let him throw his stuff in there when he comes home rotten twat like my anger is never like  based on my girl's participation like i'm sitting there like like women here's the thing women are  goofy they can't just sit there and let you be if they're into you they they love emotion  like it's crack so if it's some around they want a part of it so if you're sitting there like 
[02:30:00]  mother fucker where's my keys this this idiotic bitch there's no way she cannot join in right  this she can't not join in and even if he's looking for if this asshole is looking for her to to join  it that's just that's not even what men do if i'm banging around looking for my keys it's because  fuck i need to get the fuck out of here i'm trying to drive it's not like sweetie this is a  participation you should be angry get the fuck out of here i'm having trouble coping  half the time she's like can i help you lose your can i help you find them i don't get 
[02:30:30]  do you know where they are bitch like exactly get out of here that's ridiculous this is  you know or not that's all i need from you right now ridiculous right this is just ridiculous women  are always trying to find it because they don't have any fucking skills or charm they just don't  they don't they fucking don't and and uh good news patrice is writing a book on relationships  finally good yeah it's gonna be an amazing read i'm always trying to figure out some  shit on you right now yeah why don't they figure out how to get dick all right and they don't have 
[02:31:00]  to know they don't no they get dick because they have a vagina that's why they have no skills or charm  here here's my vagina and some assholes going and when i come home and i smell good i get them when i  good you know how much i love jerking off like i jerk off like it's pussy like like my girl thinks  i'm cheating on her because i'm like i don't you know but it's just you just it's easier it just

[02:32:00]  because i love you you need the lust if i was just looking for the lust yeah if you was an object  yeah if you was just a something i could just stick a hole if you was a hole it'd be different  but i love you i don't want to treat you like a dirty rotten hole no more this bitch i got the title  of your book oh mars and venus revisited  damien uh from akron writes uh patrice better title it fighting for dick space fighting for dick space

[02:39:00]  well that's the whole object maybe george st pierre looks really good looking like you  might be able to smack him around but i fucking everybody just looks like they can  fuck you up i picture randy laughing and and smiling like he is as he's knocking out your teeth  it's just it's just just enjoying it you know because he could jesus and he has official tough  guy ears when you see cauliflower ears you just go this guy practices to where the blood vessels  pop and you just go you know you just don't screw with people like that out on the street guys that 
[02:39:30]  walk around i'm not afraid of fighting it's like my like some people think comedy is amazing like oh  man are you good i'm go i look at tough dudes and i go that fuck i wish i was a tough guy  you come across like one you carry yourself like one no these guys like i'm i'm a big big fan i'm  actually a bigger fan of the old school what you knew and what i knew versus like my nine years of  karate versus your ten years of kung fu i love that blood sports shit um so i i would love to 
[02:40:00]  what i learned is like when i used to watch the gracies is that even if we always me and keith  always joke about you think you can beat mike tyson with he kicked your mother anger you know what i  mean like did you just kick my mother and you just go fuck that come on motherfucker and he just knows  how to like even though you coming at randy like fuck that you did something and he goes ah damn  immediately you can look at me and know i can't fight bye bye i'm like this i'm like come on put him 
[02:40:30]  up and you're like dude listen man you're gonna do something i'm gonna break your fucking eyeballs it's  just it's amazing to me man oh my god dude very amazing you um you were you were in the uh  federal fight at uh in california i think yeah i was there i had four guys on that card and uh how  many won uh three of the four one and uh the fourth one was the babaloo fight it was a good fight 
[02:41:00]  did you have two guys that ufc win too you you were behind i had one guy there yeah forest was cornering  one of our guys there that uh that won that night as well so you went in the ring and then like when  you have guys in the ring you just know how to fight yeah i mean that's what they do you mean you  trained them you trained them they trained at our school yeah in vegas extreme couture man so the  fedor fight look you got to be sick of hearing but i mean i know like everybody's sick of hearing  about fedor we get it and then he comes in to fight tim silvey who's a big fuck yeah 68 yeah a big 
[02:41:30]  dude who's 63 top five fighter yeah in the world and it was ugly how badly he got beat 36 seconds he  walked through them when did you know he was finished uh when he went down 35 yeah well the left hook  dropped him and then and then he jumped on him right away and he and he took his back and then i had a  flashback i was like wow this is kind of how my fight went with him you know i hit him right away he  went down i got his back and then i couldn't finish him and and uh fedor sunk that choke and 
[02:42:00]  now do you watch a fight like that and go like as you watch and you go ah he caught him but or do you  go holy shit he'd do that again to him the next fight like or do sometimes you go ah he just caught  him with one they should fight again you know i didn't think that he caught him but i definitely  looked like he got his you know he did his homework he he uh he knew he needed to get inside he didn't  want to dally around outside tim so long he'll he'll hit you when the bell rings and uh he jumped 
[02:42:30]  into that left hook and landed it and uh and set the tone you know he made tim look like he couldn't  fight which everyone knows he can but he made tim look like wow this poor big lanky guy wanted to get  involved and mixed up and that's how badly he beat him and he fights for a living that's when you see a  guy lose a fight you go well he beats up other dudes regularly and this dude beat him out yeah  he was on him well that i thought when fedor jumped on him to choke him out it almost seemed like an act 
[02:43:00]  of mercy like he could have pummeled him on the ground and it was almost like i'll put you out  quietly because i know you're done yeah he could have he could have kept beating on him i mean he had  position he he could have kept raining down those shots from that side position i mean he hit him three or  four times from that side position before he secured the secured his back and and put the choke  on him so but you know you take what you can so he'd have you take what you can get and he had no  fredo just he has no face expression it's it's like that's my favorite part he just has like these two 
[02:43:30]  beady eyes and he just casually chokes you his walkout i love his walkout he looks like he's going  to a picnic or something it's not intimidating he doesn't like you know like rampage gets right  he's got like a frightening approach he just gets under your face and it's like ugh but fedor doesn't  even make eye contact he's like yeah and he's chubby he's built like fred flitsel that's what  bugs me like this dude he's a he's he's i'm sure he's a rock but he just you know some dudes you you  look at and they just they're just carved out of steel you just go wow look at this mom he just 
[02:44:00]  looked like he can but fedor looks like you could might be able to take him just the way he looks he's  like a little stocky dude you're like fuck it he's just he's the best he's fucking insane let me  ask you yeah did mma destroy effectively destroy karate and kung like do does anybody still go i'm  just going to take regular kung fu yeah i think there's still some merit in in the traditional  martial arts the belt systems and you know it's still all those things that we get used to from  martial arts the the discipline the the citizenship that you know all those the honor all those sort of 
[02:44:30]  things i think and there's some merit in the technique it's just not all applicable applicable  to tell fight and so there are pieces of those things you can pull out and you know straight  blast and kung fu there's there's things you can use from all those things there's no more takedowns  ever like it at first it was it was uh the gracies taking everybody down like like dudes that were  like ninth dan or whatever black belts they were just getting tossed around by pat smith and uh and 
[02:45:00]  and the gracies and uh and uh shamrock who just got beat beat up by a dude uh yeah english guy buzzy  something or something like that yeah i don't know who he was yeah some dude oh boy but um but then it  then it became okay we're going to learn how to not get took down now it's like you don't even see  takedowns hardly anymore it's like takedowns now it's now it's just stand up fighting now it's just  going back to that because there's no more shooting it used to just be this shooting thing and 
[02:45:30]  and it's become more difficult to take guys down they've gotten better at sprawling and  and countering takedowns and scrambling even if you do get them to their butt you know they're gonna  they're not going to settle there they're gonna scramble and get back to their feet you know chuck is  a perfect example of that he was one of the first guys that kind of used his wrestling skills to keep  a fight standing and uh everybody developed wrestling skills for that purpose isn't any aspect you  would add that you go man just as a fan or whatever as a fan would you what would you add to 
[02:46:00]  make it better like to you like you this would be so much better if this was if this happened i'm  pretty comfortable with it the way it is i'm not sure that you know it's kind of like if it ain't  broke don't fix it i don't know i'd tweak it too much uh i think sometimes uh you don't always see  the best fighter come out when when there's elbows on the ground because you can trap especially with the  fence you can trap a guy against the fence it's hard to defend a guy from dropping an elbow in  your face and cutting you and then the fight ends because of a cut right uh that might be something 
[02:46:30]  that yeah that people have talked about exploring you know taking out the elbows on the ground and  on your feet it's a very technical thing to do because you know the guy's fluid he can move it's  hard to land an elbow right to a guy's head when he's when he's moving around but when you can trap  him against a solid barrier it's easier to drop an elbow on his face bring bringing knees back you're  seeing guys comfortable countering or they get in on a shot and they'll hang out on their knees  because they know the guy can't knee him in the head well that that uh what's that skinny kid from 
[02:47:00]  uh uh the brazil that's he's uh he's like one of the baddest dudes going right now uh  anderson silva yeah like beat you up with his kneecaps yeah but let me ask you like i know  fadar is said to be this the baddest dude on earth right now right who who personally like whether he's  considered a bit but who personally do you watch or you have you ever watched and you took a deep  breath like oof that's a that's a bad that dude is bad but he might not be considered the baddest but 
[02:47:30]  you go dude well i think crow cop was that way the first time i saw crow cop i was at ringside and  he threw a kick upside nogara's head and i was like holy shit i was like i mean i got goosebumps  but he's not going to sleep that i was like holy cow it was amazing crow cut when you first saw crow  yeah the first time i saw him i was like i don't ever want to be on the end of one of those and he  fought fedor actually went to distance with fedor uh it was a decision that he lost on i think um  yeah i think he lost a decision he was a very tough cat now now you get in the ring after the fedor 
[02:48:00]  fight and uh he asked fedor who would you like to fight next and and he says something in russian  it was a couture and everybody cheered because they want to see you fight him uh why would you  want to do that not the united great fighter is that how you guys look at it yeah i don't know  yeah i want to fight the best guys you want to be considered the best heavyweight in the world you  got to fight the best and this fight's on it's it's all it's not official yet i mean i've still got to  get free and clear of the ufc contract and all that what's going on with that because i mean didn't 
[02:48:30]  you have two more fights with them that you were supposed to honor and you're not 18 months or four  fights wasn't and four fights so that there's the rub they they say i still owe them two fights but  the contract language you know i wasn't happy with the fights they're putting in front of me  this is the fight i want so you're trying to get 45 i realized i don't have forever to keep fighting  this is the best fighter that i'm going to be right now and and i want to fight fedor i told them i want  to fight fedor make the fedor fight happen if they come back to me now and say we got fedor we're going 
[02:49:00]  to make the fedor fight happen i'm going to go fight fedor in the ufc i don't care where it happens  and he's pride right or no no pride doesn't really exist anymore he was pride that's where he where  he beat a lot of the top guys don't you have him he's got like about 14 he's 31 i mean that's a big  difference i mean uh which age is just a number that's i mean i've been up against that since day  one so that doesn't really matter oh i'm not saying that it's not possible  i kind of heard that he's a really quiet soft-spoken guy this guy is just a problem 
[02:49:30]  well he's saying he's always been that much older than everybody anyway so i didn't start fighting  until i was 33 no kidding combative sports age you're already over the hill what did you do before  that i was a wrestling coach at oregon state university and i was wrestling for the national  team the u.s team do you have a stare you put on people when you get in the ring it's usually a smile 
[02:50:00]  that freaks him out really yeah that'd do it in front of 16 000 people and you wink and smile at  somebody they're like oh what's what's up yeah what's up with this guy no that i don't know do you  do you know um marsh are you are you a marsh artist are you well since my first fight i mean  i entered my first ufc ufc 13 as a wrestler i mean i didn't have any real boxing training i i'd  played around with some submission stuff in the in the army and a little bit of boxing in the army 
[02:50:30]  but nothing extensive and and i've been wrestling since i was 10 years old and and uh realized quickly  that wrestling was only going to take me so far i needed to learn some striking my my very next ufc was  against vitor belford at the time he was annihilating everybody oh right and i was like  this guy will rip my head off if i don't start studying some so your second fight was and vitor  was a bad dude for a second but he's gone like something happened with his sister or something but  he just fought on on an affliction card and did did really really well uh he knocked out terry martin 
[02:51:00]  so he's back yeah he looks great you know a kid that i thought was good and uh arlovsky like  he was supposed to be this monster did you see him saturday no dude you gotta see his  fight on saturday he fought ben rothwell oh yeah with the beard oh that was the fight of the  night yeah he's a tough dude unbelievable that that's the andre i remember right just an ass  kicker i mean he just he he unleashed it did um did forrest forrest what you call for already right  yeah i thought the rampage one by decision but i think he should have i thought i should have kept 
[02:51:30]  the belt yeah i don't think he took the belt i thought i thought he won i i would not have i would  not have been upset if they did if i mean i thought it was that close it could have went the  other way just as easily but i you know and i'm trying to rationalize like because i was cornering  forrest and i thought well you know he won three of the rounds yeah especially the last two and then  the second round he when he kicked rampage and rampage buckled and almost went the whole round 
[02:52:00]  trying to keep him from beating exactly that could almost have been a 10-8 round but you could almost  say that the first round was a 10-8 round for rampage so you know as i scored it i thought  forrest won three of the rounds rampage clearly won two of the rounds there's a round there that could  have gone either way and and so and that determined the fight that's yeah that's why i kind of felt  like if you're gonna take your guy's belt like if you're gonna take your guy's belt like in any  other fight i would say yeah um you gotta knock him out but i'm certainly not going to disagree  mm-hmm who's it randy on fighting outcomes two questions randy uh one you probably won't 
[02:52:30]  ask because but who's an overrated bum you thought of all time like in a in the in the ufc sense or  the mma sense where you go this guy's a bum why is everybody all whatever and then the other one's  kimbo slice and i'm not because kimbo can catch you in the street but what do you think about  he's not like a professional dude that goes okay i have to register my hands with the police  but um what do you think akimbo and then and who do you think is one of the most overrated all 
[02:53:00]  time is like you go this guy just never was good to me yeah i don't know that i can think of anybody  that i felt was like overrated i think everybody's kind of had their moments here and there where  the you know they they had flashes of that that was impressive uh and they may not have and then  you know the hype that comes after that and all that i mean that's just that's normal uh kimbo you  know kimbo's a good guy you know he's quiet he gets in the gym he's doing his thing he's  the first one to tell you like a bum he's the first one to tell you look i got some big holes in my mma 
[02:53:30]  game and i think elite x he's the one that's putting him out there as the be all and end all  this guy's the unstoppable force and you know and i don't think kimbo comes across that way and  obviously the james thompson fight i think his weaknesses were exposed he's he's got some serious  i mean would you lick your chops if they put him up against you yeah i don't think they would ever do  that they're smarter than that do you think you'd give him a beating yeah i'm not going to stand  toe-to-toe with him i'm going to i'm going to smother him and put him on the ground and and  unlike james i'm going to finish him he's not going to get out of it how long would it take you would 
[02:54:00]  you say like to pin uh to pin is a bad word that's that's a funny i'm like we don't want to  pinning them yeah how long would it take you to knock someone down uh how long would it take you to  to say uh about like uh like patrice how long would it take you to make patrice a big guy like  this and in in one he would know immediately that i don't fight for a living how where he would he 
[02:54:30]  would tell me what he's going to do and then i would have a decision on whether to keep fighting  like i know that because i'm a fan of this stuff there were times where i said oh he got him he got  him and then you go oh shit the other dude that i thought had him is tapping like you go you just  it ain't about it's just about no it's almost it's mechanics it's it's professionalism dude it's not  like it's just not like hey he can fight the the average dude on the street can't beat any of these 
[02:55:00]  dudes ever like no matter if you're tough they just know what to do they if they don't go dude you're  gonna get hurt because i already look at you and know that you can't sized you up yeah you know  by the way your feet are like if i kick him right now he'll fall down and and if he punches me in my  stomach i'd cry for mercy you got no guard i'll say i'm gonna sue if you hit me i'm gonna sue you put 
[02:55:30]  those hands up you got your arm gonzaga broke your arm i mean gonzaga is a fucking scary dude because  he he's the one that knocked out he looked good in his last fight yeah and he knocked his he has a  mule foot uh he kicked the guy kicks he does kick like a mule and he broke is he good that that dude  is he he's got some good skills i think he's he's got a little ways to go to kind of climb back up into  the top rankings but he's he's you know he's a very very good submission guy that's that's kind of  where he made his reputation is in abu dhabi and uh and he's he's put together some great kickboxing 
[02:56:00]  skills uh wrestling skills you know that making the transition is where's where he needs to to  work a little bit now but uh you know he's he's tough i saw a video i saw a video you you was so  mad you lost to this dude it was an old video you lost it was a uh hawaiian dude oh ensign in a way  in the way which that was my first loss in mma like i saw that and he was so mad like you were like  oh this mother he got you with some weird uh yeah and he was like oh i slipped up it was a stupid 
[02:56:30]  mistake you know he was like oh can we just do that again like i saw that there man that was yeah  was he is he still fighting no he retired a while ago his brother too i don't know if egan's still  fighting or not uh i haven't seen egan in quite some time so any dude you don't really like like  you go if you've seen him on the street you go come on right now motherfucker i get along pretty  well with everybody i mean there's there's a there's guys that that rub you the wrong way or 
[02:57:00]  a little bit of you know uh josh barnett just fought and and he's he's uh he's a personable  guy but he's just one of those guys that's a little edgy you know and and so i can deal with  him he's he's fine he's a seattle boy i grew up in seattle and he looked good he knocked paid her  out this last weekend i mean that was impressive that the but he's just a guy that you know i'm not  gonna go spend a bunch of time with right he's just like i don't know did you you you wrote a  book um and it's called uh becoming a natural becoming the natural my life in and out of the cage 
[02:57:30]  um does this book have anything to do with fighting  yeah there's a little in there just a little no it covers my career but it it goes back and  and uh kind of covers my whole life and do you have any copies of the book  uh actually yeah i think we have a copy we can get a copy i hope so where's where's copies of  the book yeah we want a copy oh my god is that your i love that shit oh my god wow thank god we 
[02:58:00]  didn't say anything that's a slugger there hi i didn't even know you were here i was gonna ask  you how long you been together we've been together it'll be two years in october two years yeah  together for four but we've been married for is it was a lot of his would you just is he hot in  general or the fact that he punches other men in their grill just did it turn you on that he fights  that he just fights do you worry about him when he fights no not at all really no jenna didn't  feel that way watching tito guy he kind of said hey you look like uh jason stratham here 
[02:58:30]  oh yeah a little bit you know uh yeah that's his name right jason stratham have any guys hit on  you in a bar have been rude that's my that's the type of nightmare i would do  hi i'm miss couture you'd be like oh she she would say i would say something stupid and then  turn just in time to see his fist coming toward your head well he's not like that at all but it  is funny if if we're separated and guys are you know getting ready to make the move and then i'll walk 
[02:59:00]  up i know what they're doing i'll walk up and hug and kiss all over him and they're like oh i feel  stupid but there's been no problems i'm thinking other things no oh jesus did you see his left eye  his left eye just moved yeah this is how women are i know she wants to see randy break somebody's  face in a bar by just what she said trust me he's so laid back i'd take him out before some guy that'd be 
[02:59:30]  like you know who the fuck does he think he is just someone with this one second where he loses his  mind over booze and shit and he sees your lovely wife and everything and just goes like who the  fuck does he think he is oh what hey mr fucking fighter man you know what it's all about  fucking element to surprise dude i'll hit him first he'll go down like a motherfucker 
[03:00:00]  and then this half-ass drunk punch glances off you and you just have to go dude you're dead i'm just not  even not even using a percentage of what you could do just just your your finger on his forehead and  push him it would be hysterical to watch guys like randy i'm sure like that's how you know you're a bad  dude it's like when you start to think about fighting all you start thinking about is the legal  ramifications like you have no fear of like getting beaten up by a guy in a bar it's like all right well 
[03:00:30]  look i'm gonna i know i'm gonna probably paralyze him how much is this gonna cost me in court like  like that's you have to start worrying about you for legal reasons you don't like to find yourself  in those situations anyway but mugs don't play fair now i mean they they're bringing out blades they  bringing out guns like i don't want no part in all that do you have to register is that is that a myth  is that a fucking myth that's a myth but it's true in the court of law unless my life is in danger i  don't have a leg to stand on for taking somebody out i mean that's a myth it's written on the back of 
[03:01:00]  my license to kill it's a myth hey brandy your wife fought yeah my wife she's fought three times  yeah wow oh she's an mb or mma um there's a girl in elite xc that uh ah yeah she runs around like uh  that's my training really wait so you fight so you so the baddest chicken like round right now is your  is your clothes too ah it stinks all right i don't want to get a rivalry going yeah uh mars wants in 
[03:01:30]  on this where's mars where is oh yeah our guys we have guys that uh oh yeah master ball is here too  isn't he yeah there you go hey stud yeah now mars you've said on many occasions that you like you've  seen like a lot of mistakes in randy's fights oh that's not true  you've discovered a weakness haven't you why don't you explain to randy i mean god i had nausea  him with us blah blah blah but now you got the chance uh no weakness no holes in your game there 
[03:02:00]  but i did want to ask oh look at wait wait could we say opie could you please tell mars to take two  deep breaths yeah just come on let me hold your hand it's okay it's okay go ahead answer i did want to  ask what i love about this mars and poe walk around like they're the baddest motherfuckers in in xm and  now look but you've been humbled he really did he really did hold his chest like a woman that was  scared like mr couture did i pronounce that correctly is that from a french um french background mr couture 
[03:02:30]  mars and poe have been humbled today i like this well mars and poe are not they're not bullies uh with  anybody they're not tough like they don't act like dicks to people they just we just kind of all  know like all right you have to tolerate a certain amount of incompetence at work  i can't lose your teeth if you fucking question how long would it take you to beat someone like  mars you think he's got some training he don't know the guy yeah he's not gonna say that what 10 
[03:03:00]  seconds please just we'll laugh for months after this oh but you know what it is it's that he  he doesn't this is the great thing it's that he doesn't give a fuck what you know that is the  amazing thing like poe you have to consider poe like in my mind you go i've seen poe do some  shit but you go they don't consider that this dude he goes i don't know what i can do but he's not not  considering fucking him up he's just going i don't know the guy gotta watch him maybe gotta fight him  but fighting is a you don't give a fuck i give a fuck yeah when you get punched in your nose 
[03:03:30]  or your eye you see that white light you'd be like i man i quit that whole sucks that whole thing  when you get hit and just hear that sound and you're all fucking just where am i and then it's  all slow motion but you know you're still getting punched because you're still wing wing  wing it's like but i'm not feeling it i better fall down or that lay down that lay down with your 
[03:04:00]  left arm stuck in the air not moving that shit is like unnecessary man that's the thing that's  amazing it's not all these guys it's that dude i don't give a fuck who you are even though there's  pistols nowadays you know but just that i do yeah i don't care i don't care i'm not i'll get  knocked out or i'll knock you out which is that's amazing part of it is being able to kick ass the 
[03:04:30]  other part is being able to take an ass kicking like to you could be great if you get hit once in  the face and you fall down every time you're gonna be a sucky fucking fighter then at the end of the  day you got knocked out your hands up in the air they they wake you up and you go oh man you call  me randy give a good hug like yeah yeah just knock me out and i kiss him on his cheek good  one like the sportmanship like yeah you know who beat me up you know who could take a punch randy's  wife yeah broken jaw right and you continued fighting to the end yeah yeah i broke my jaw on 
[03:05:00]  that first punch that last first punch and she didn't say and she didn't say like patrice eloquently  put it i quit i quit patrice i quit oh that's fucked up the crowd would be going what all right  i do have a question about that are there any repercussions um with the other fighter because  i understand that you guys went out and went to touch gloves and then she started right away isn't  there something like uh that can be done to the other fighter because you know i mean no i don't think 
[03:05:30]  it was intentional and there is no set rule saying that you have to touch gloves when you walk out  there i just in the five years i've been watching fights i've seen maybe twice and they were from  arch enemies not touch gloves so that was me being naive and and trying to be sportsman like that  whole uh wanted to touch some gloves and yeah she she just clapped me but i don't think she did  intentionally i think it was a lot of nerves and maybe the pressure i'm sure that was the biggest  show and biggest audience that she ever fought in front of so she wasn't trying to sucker punch you 
[03:06:00]  i don't think so no how about this fake glove on a stick under your armpit other arm around your  back you come out they go to tap the one on the stick you come around with the one behind your back  now that'd teach him why not have you ever been have you ever been sucked by a guy  like i mean i'm sure you train but have you ever been hit with a ufc man punch not by a ufc fighter no  but you could like a regular i think she implied i could take one from you fat boy 
[03:06:30]  not by a trained shoulder blade  by a real man by a real man or someone like you patrice you pudgy boy  jesus christ every one of us has the same feeling like every time somebody talks to randy's wife the  rest of us go please don't say the wrong thing don't say anything wrong please don't shut them off  ma'am um sparring with randy does suck though i do spar with randy and oh really yeah how how much  uh leeway you give her you you're pretty you're pretty he's like i'm going easy i'm like it 
[03:07:00]  fucking hurts can you can you toss around like a girl if she if she came up to the highest level  that she wanted to could you could you toss around like a girl still yeah well i think we're  obviously i'll weigh her by oh 100 pounds so i mean oh when we grapple we we go at it  uh uh can we see a little of that  we ain't filming none of that we'll turn down the lights and everything come on it's funny because 
[03:07:30]  he uh you know we'll grapple and then he just starts laughing because he's teaching  me everything he knows and when i i catch him with something he just starts laughing like  what am i doing you taught him by the way someone of that one someone has to say because it's radio  she's absolutely stunning she's an 11. she's ridiculous say that yeah well what are you looking  at what are you looking at opie i want to make sure that what what's an 11. her eyes from her  eyebrows between the nose and eyebrows that's all i'm looking when you call someone 11 it means you've 
[03:08:00]  assessed the entire package pretty thoroughly no i didn't mean that i meant an 11. jimmy said 11.  i just said she's stunning on the one to ten she's an 11 that's a compliment the hat i love the hat  look at the body what a pain in the ass that is just look mr couture listen your wife's shoes they're  nice she doesn't have a girl like that that could take care of herself though anyway like like some 
[03:08:30]  guy gives us some crest some ordinary jerk off at a bar oh she's dude yeah she could  fuck them up what a game that must be just how cool is it that you get to spar with your wife i  mean it's a genius ask a lot of people down south they'll tell you they love it she don't but he  never has to look up from his plate like he just goes it's just like i'll do what you gotta do my  wife's gonna knock you out in about two minutes yeah oh oh boy here you go fella i bet you the  post-sparring activity is what happened to ma is quite i'm still here quite special did you want 
[03:09:00]  ma start all your questions with golly g golly g golly g randy um you're like rolling right now  this is very happy oh randy's the man man you've been putting your place today um  i love it yeah i saw he was um i was just gushing he was at veto belforce corner so now he's training  under you he started training with us for this for this fight and he's uh i think he's he's gone 
[03:09:30]  back to brazil now for a couple weeks and then he's moving he's moving to vegas i think to train  with us full-time he's gonna be on your team for yeah that's the uh is that the question you really  want to ask ma ask the real question do you really train vetoed brail that was the question  no because they fought um twice before three times yeah three times why do you have to embarrass him  by not knowing how many times yeah my bad no one of them was only 20 seconds yeah but they fought in  the past and now they're working together so that is a pretty good question by mars 
[03:10:00]  it's something you see in our sport a lot i mean i fought mo smith for my first title and then  later when i was trying to get ready to fight pedro again and didn't want to get kicked in the  damn leg again like that i went to him see i knew he's the best kickboxer i knew and he's from seattle  and and i trained with him a bunch to to kind of shore up my kickboxing so i didn't get kicked in the leg  again uh so i think that's real common in our sport you ever fight the great boss rutan no i was  scheduled to fight him back in the day uh and he ended up fighting uh kosaka down in uh the brazil fight 
[03:10:30]  the brazil ufc and he's done he's officially not he's retired he's doing a lot of commentating  a lot of analyst work and a great guy we're partners in a gym and in uh i like bass root  yeah he's fun you ever uh fun you ever fight a frenchman underwater  i'm french myself you laugh but i have  underwater i got something you haven't done that's right there you go scuba diving i got in a fight 
[03:11:00]  with a frenchman underwater oh my gosh it was it was a wonderful fight no one got hurt because  you know we're slow motion fighting but it's hard to throw a punch underwater i guess yeah  you can't get any like footing so we were like kind of rolling as we're fighting but yeah that  went down scuba diving yeah pull his regulator out that's the trick gotta pull that regulator or use  your knife on it mask off i was scuba diving really fast and the frenchman came down on top of me because  he wasn't listening to what they were trying to tell him on the boat because he's a 
[03:11:30]  he was just an ass i should say he was french well i wanted to say that yeah but then he he  landed on top of me and then we had a fight huh because that's what you do wow yeah that's like  sea hunt yeah cool like the james bond moment yeah yeah fighting underwater i got something on him  i knew i had something i like that when a couple of men are going back that's right thank you jimmy  some uh you know some gladiator stories hey uh mars what do you think of randy's uh wife 
[03:12:00]  uh she's a great fighter no no no that's not what we're talking about  compliment randy's wife good looking woman oh yeah hell you mean by that  jesus exactly what i mean don't insult the guy's wife like that what makes her good looking oh boy  are you would you call yourself a jealous dude no you're easy easy right  so you shouldn't be nervous what what do you find good looking about she's a pretty lady  pretty face mm-hmm in shape 
[03:12:30]  if you had any if you had any brains you would just feign homosexuality right  i don't know what you're talking about  what's your discipline maz i i'm right now i'm doing judo and jiu-jitsu  but that's it what wasn't you doing what was what's he do what's poe do where's poe we're  what's mr poe oh christopher what is your real that was uh here comes poe  hey jiu-jitsu yes this is our master poe oh 
[03:13:00]  shit look at him oh he can do splits between two chairs  i think poe beat bolo young  he's got his own theme music and everything randy is it my time there's master poe  testing one two yeah okay what do you got poe how you doing randy good how are you  i'm good to see you again i want to say that first of all i think you're a fantastic fighter and your  wife is gorgeous oh this is just uncomfortable already what do you mean 
[03:13:30]  fuck me man oh shit oh crap would you like to go to fh riley  let's just get a karaoke machine and stop this this is not good oh you're  we can do a duet on karaoke so what do you want to say to randy after you've upset him yeah  he's a five-time champion correct five times oh it'd be nothing funny to watch him randy and his 
[03:14:00]  wife jump him she takes mars he takes poe our staff is beaten up by the kodores  i like them apples that's so tough now oh my god i love this oh shit  randy everyone says that mixed martial arts is the closest to street fighting what do you say  about it very naturally i'm asking that 
[03:14:30]  like poe's a really sweet guy  back to you randy  it's as close to a real fight as you can get obviously there's still got to be some rules  and that's the difference street fighting that you know those guys can buy you they can i mean  whatever anything can happen in a street fight that's a major difference right um and and forgive  me i'm not familiar with mixed martial arts the uh the fighters that's why i always go to marcelino  because he has all the he knows all the fighters and and he knows the upcoming fighters and i only 
[03:15:00]  know certain few but the other day i seen a mixed martial arts match also knows a lot about their  why  fucking mars thanks  i see  i see  no no seriously i see  it  i see  i see  now he's standing too close  around me  this  it's cold  let's  it's in this man this is bad 
[03:15:30]  it's going bad  no we  i don't want this to go someplace man  we want this dad with one of these  idiots begging for the  and they're both doing the nervous dance masalino  he's doing the marcarino  he's rubbing his his palms together  he's sweating  jesus christ  you are fantastic and your wife is beautiful i must say right away  all right 
[03:16:00]  all right tough guy  finish your question tough guy  holy  fuck  the other day  the other day for the first time for the first time i've seen a mixed martial arts uh match and i  don't know who it was it was a guy  pardon me which was a black guy right and a white guy forgive me i don't know the name  why are you saying okay it was the other day it was on saturday  and the guy got poked in the eye this is like the karate who's on first  he's talking about the burns and anthony johnson fight 
[03:16:30]  was that in the ufc  yeah he was he was somewhere else but he's actually talking about kevin burns and anthony johnson  fight right it was a great fight both of them were fantastic but the one technique  that that messed up anthony johnson yes was the poke to the eyes was an accidental technique  yeah absolutely yeah it wasn't intentional he kept doing it because he has a broken left hand so  he can't really uh make a fist so when he strikes he tries to palm strike but calm strike he was 
[03:17:00]  trying to reach i guess and poking him yeah yeah well back in the day when i had a show called the  arena we were talking about the comparison between mixed martial arts  first of all but you did one show yeah one day it was great one hour two where he invited convicts  up to this fine facility right oh the radio yeah killers actually yeah they were killers that got  out of jail just in time to do his radio show the guy had a cookbook how to shank with macaroni and  cheese right so this so this this earth-breaking radio show happened one time yeah yeah but anyway 
[03:17:30]  these guys that came in they obviously have to survive in prison right and their style of fighting was uh  52 blocks do you know what that is ready not of course not no you have to be incarcerated to learn it  not how oh okay okay 52 blocks anyway so what massalino and i always argue about is mixed martial 
[03:18:00]  arts and street fighting one's being on the i'm sorry yeah one's a sport and one's life or death  it's the big difference randy here's my argument as a mixed martial artist a professional mixed martial  artist you could turn that switch and you could do all the illegal stuff that you're not allowed  to do to a person out in the street if you had to if you had to if i had you pinned down and i got  you pinned down and i your ears right there and i bite it you know that's it i on my ear you're  probably going to choke to death but that's good uh randy uh we have to explore what's going on 
[03:18:30]  what you're right is this uncomfortable right now why is something's going on it's just  because he even gave he gave mars a little something about his ear just to say hey  calm down i'm a man too i'm just like you so you can just calm down right he said if you eat my ear  he made a kind of kind of the cauliflower ear thing to just say calm down young fella it was a good joke 
[03:19:00]  because even the problem was martian himself getting ready like if i was on top of you  like what maybe that was the problem  how about randy if you had your knee in my teeth  oh my god  randy you made our day you have no idea  holy we'll be laughing about this for months do you think a mixed martial artist is a disadvantage 
[03:19:30]  as an advantage because when he fights a street fighter he can now use what he normally can't  as opposed to a street fighter getting into a ring who has to lose skills that are illegal in  mixed martial arts is that what you're saying absolutely yeah i would i would pick the  mixed martial artist because he can obviously street fight i mean most i would paul what do you think  okay a mixed martial artist they they train to pummel to ground for pounds to rip their pawn  apart and you're telling me that they could turn the light the switch on and turn it off whenever 
[03:20:00]  they want yeah the rules of engagement i train for specific rules of engagement and take away those  rules of engagements then i can do all those other things as well and he never feels like his life is  at risk in the mma like is is renowned that they're trying to say the mma is safe and in boxing like because  they come in and you just the guys don't get these this sustained damage but if you're on a street  fight and some motherfucker is trying to kill i think it's like anyone else natural instinct that even  you know you don't have to be trained to do to that kicks in with a street fight computer nerd that 
[03:20:30]  works down at best buy is gonna try to kick some ass you're trying to live yeah so i think when you're  getting trained to to and you know that this the other dude is not going to be able to really  mess you up then then it's a different idea but if some dude's getting ready to bite you and you  you gouge his eye out naturally though you'll just try to do something and there's no weapons in mma  like you know the guy isn't holding a knife or a gun or a hammer or a bat or a rock or a stick or 
[03:21:00]  perhaps something else that could hurt you jimmy a dress a kind of a dress i gotta i gotta jump in  because uh these guys got a plane to catch oh oh they literally have to leave right now uh beforehand  i think it would be uh uh the right thing if you and poe apologized to randy and his wife for all  the stuff you said they they come in here to be guests and friends and show and she's willing to  come on and all of a sudden it's embarrassing the coutures yeah i know you're saying it's okay 
[03:21:30]  but it's not okay getting fresh so mars will start with you if you would if you would apologize to  randy and his wife that would be wonderful we want randy to come back yeah we love it if there's  anything i did that offended either one of you could you move a little more apologize  i'm watching katherine hepburn saying she's sorry  subtle movements of a rock'em sock'em robot  why does mars sound like he should be on broadway all of a sudden your voice  hey mars mars is a dangerous dude 
[03:22:00]  this is really golly genius oh shucks right uh poe please is he a favorite of all time  mars randy is one of my favorites of all time  who do you who do you like better than randy i don't um the reason i like randy so much is  because he adapts so well to every style that comes to us no no no no you just i love you but  you just skipped over that who you like yeah you said one i do not like anyone more than you but 
[03:22:30]  oh there's an equal level of so who's in in the top who's your top five but fedor is an animal  and we need to see that fight fedor fedor who do you got fedor or randy i got randy so do i  absolutely because he can adapt and overcome all right good enough all right paul  the apology because we gotta get him out of here  us you know what us means ma'am please say no thank you you know what this means randy  it means it means without the p and the y that's what i think it means 
[03:23:00]  are you  i just think you left the p in the y off you don't call people an us  us just call randy a goddamn us  us is a matter of respect when you say hello to someone and you say goodbye the last time we did  this you said well why don't we just say hello and goodbye right but in the martial arts you're 
[03:23:30]  giving a higher respect okay when you say us you're respecting that person to the highest level i've never  said that to anybody yeah japanese randy doesn't say that yeah randy just says goodbye he says hi  right he just hey how you doing hey take it easy  nice to see you i don't know about this thing he doesn't take this whole thing seriously he's  a man he just says thanks guys i'll see you later well we have to  oh this is so funny you guys are flying out we don't want to not have the big plug um  the book is called becoming the natural my life in and out of the cage i mean uh randy

[03:27:30]  and he's just and if i just tough dudes are just i just love that whole world man and he's not a  bullying tough guy he's a quiet guy but that you know you'd have to really push a dude like that  to get him what was that nervousness about maz what would the what the fuck was that you've seen a  thousand people in here in your life oh that's a bad motherfucker right there uh no because mars  takes his fighting seriously it's it's probably if you met richard prior or somebody you'd be out 
[03:28:00]  of your mind right i would but i would i wouldn't be i'd be more like oh i would have so much  admiration but it wouldn't be like that was uncomfortable like i've never seen you was like  oh gee god like you were just like you really were like smitten no honestly but was it based on  fame or based on he's a bad motherfucker it's based on he's a bad motherfucker i i really truly  admire the dude but if you saw anderson silva not anderson so who's the dude from brazil 
[03:28:30]  anderson silva anderson silva what's the one that just lost that just lost to to fedor  oh uh tim silva tim silvia and anderson silva is one of the baddest motherfucker i've ever seen in my  life right if he was there sitting down would you just be as like oh boy you know i don't think so  because i look up to randy because of our age i'm like i'm 43 he's 44 that's it yes you're what  43. i thought you were gonna get me some of that kung fu i'm thinking yeah what the fuck is  but that's that um no that's that fucking he got a lot of third world in him man third world people 
[03:29:00]  stay good looking good puerto rico in a goddamn third world you're just puerto rican damn third world  dude you're just out of the shadow of third world wait a minute are you stop getting like all of a sudden  you're fucking massachusetts you guys are you guys just got out of third world status let's relax  randy if randy it's in third world he would have said oh hell yeah he would he would have 
[03:29:30]  he would have spoken his whole third world language you motherfucker yeah what you say  niggas third world i'm about to kick you inside your temple hi i'm mars i'm an aborigine  yeah if you guys if you guys were officially yeah if you guys were officially a state you'd be  right behind alabami i didn't know you was puerto rican i thought you was yes sir you you held up  pretty damn good for a puerto rican man well i gotta be for a puerto rican man puerto ricans fall  apart quickly man you don't fucking know your expiration date is just puerto ricans you can't 
[03:30:00]  figure out how old they are at the time serious let's be honest women no no no i gotta give it to  patrice and the women the women fall apart after the first kid god after the first when they are a kid  what's that about i don't know man it's the coochie frito i guess i i have no idea  i've never fried food i've never seen i have never seen a beautiful cougar puerto rican woman no  ever i'm sure there are some dynasty but i've just never seen what about her the kid 
[03:30:30]  she's puerto rican oh she's from some other brown she's some brown i'm out the kid i'm out the kid i think  she's from africa he's a weird fucking looking block-headed motherfucker the answer to the  richard pryor question yes chris w has it if i met richard pryor i'd be intimidated he's been dead for  years yeah i'd be horrified screaming because he'd be a zombie i mean i know the context but you were 
[03:31:00]  like if i see somebody i admired man but randy's been at it a long time too so there's a history there  you know like i've been i i mean when i saw vince mcmahon it took everything in me then i go  i you know vince it's vince i was i felt you know like holy shit yeah but still you know the the ego  trigger came on but maz was just visibly that's why he made that joke about his own ears just right  to just to calm me down to love you today hey i'm a human being how bad did you want randy to hit you 
[03:31:30]  no i'm serious just because then that would be like the thing you'd be telling all your buddies  dude you're not gonna believe who fucking hit me today right in a way that'd be cool right  no i'm thinking in a way that'd be cool mars would you like to be hit by randy one time  just for the story that's poe that's poe i mean poe sorry and who's your top five i want to know  who's who's ahead of randy now that he's not here because somebody was ahead of him no no i uh not  ahead of him but i think that okay yeah name your top five come on man that he's top five 
[03:32:00]  but i think that he's gonna have a bit of a problem with fedor fedor he's gonna have a problem with  that you think he's gonna win he's gonna have a problem with that guy that guy's an animal kick  his stupid ass is what you said uh no not that now what makes fedor the guy though what makes him so  amazing he's just a violent individual he goes in there and he's just violent he's an animal he is  i mean if you you talk about anderson silva right and he's very artistic a talented you know you can 
[03:32:30]  see him you know moving like ali he's ufc too right anderson silva yes but fedor can't just be good  from being violent and i'm watching we're watching the video now he's not so violent would just come  in and he's watch watch watch first strike watch the first strike oh my god oh my god that's an  animal oh jesus all the punches those punches come from just a crazy place that's a six foot eight  champion six foot eight yeah you watch how calm he is as he locks him and he grabs his face and just 
[03:33:00]  chokes him out and he's so done right there he's not even blinking he's casual oh he's got his  fucking heel in his cock wow oh that's got to be humiliating and fuck him off fedor looks like  somebody and if you've seen him he's a balding chunky man and he just he did michael chiklis he  looks like the fucking the bent yes man some photos of him yeah hey uh because i'm learning 
[03:33:30]  every day randy's on it i'm kind of on his way out though he's not fighting on a regular basis these  well age why he's 45 nine yeah and uh he had retired i think and then come out of retirement  um but he wants to and i think he came out of retirement just because of the popularity of the  sports getting so ridiculous he wants a little little peace before he goes away for good right  all those guys that went through all that shit before they came out of the role he's got no money  judeau knocked down samba samba is a form of uh judah as well they just do it a little different  they don't wear uh long pants all right give us some samba i don't know samba that's russian well 
[03:34:00]  how about you do this the the samba jesus click click that again like he doesn't look like  anything special like he right i mean oh yeah okay that's the baddest dude in the world that  guy looks scary as he does he but in terms of body type he doesn't look like uh like he's gonna  smash you body type he doesn't look as um dude we've had we've had a lot of these guys in at this  point the the one guy that really just scares me just looking at him is uh liddell tito i mean 
[03:34:30]  they all can kick her ass obviously looks scary and finish but i'm just saying rampage didn't do  it not tito not randy when liddell comes in you're like i'm watching every fucking word i say in the  next half hour because he seems like you know he seems like my my image of him is that he's just a  a crazy fighting redneck grew up his dad hit him with bricks in his head and he just slept on tires 
[03:35:00]  like that's my image i'm not saying that that's fucking him i'm saying when i look at him don't  know him he got that fu manchu he got tattoos on his head of of of asian letters and he's just he  looks like he's just fights what liddell chuck yeah he looks like he and he breathes like a ball  when he's just sitting there yeah he's just not he just seems like he he's born from like randy  couture seemed like he's born from training right but chuck look like he's born from fighting but 
[03:35:30]  that's also um uh uh what's his name rampage is it comes from fighting he doesn't come from  i'm gonna take a discipline and all that and all the us and shit he comes from what motherfucker you  know that's what chuck seems like he comes from too you know he comes from there's a bear shitting  on me i better hit it  yeah i'm not right that's hilarious  fucking fatal man yeah hey uh any other fatal fights on there by the way uh mars was telling me 
[03:36:00]  that he could kick poe's ass which i thought was pretty he's dying to see that shit man which was  pretty brave to say and now they're both in studio who would you put who would you put  fedor versus poe i'm sorry fedor versus poe are you serious look at him laughing he's laughing  are you serious look at him yeah yeah yeah that's a serious question fedor versus poe how long  how long could poe last in a fight like that okay better question thank you in a uh how long would 
[03:36:30]  you give poe in a ring in a ring with fedor with rules with rules with the 52 blocks i love you  okay no rules no rules no rules fedor versus in a ring though no rules i don't like the ring either  uh he might have uh it'll be a while two minutes  what happened what happened seconds to minutes  so with rules seconds all the blood just drained with no with no rules minutes minutes couple of 
[03:37:00]  minutes with rules that would be seconds but no rules that's impressive poe yes he's agreeing with  i know that people were laughing out there but i i was thinking that's kind of impressive you think  you can last two minutes no rules the only question for poe is this even without rules again i'm not  talking about weapons um but the only problem is fedor would probably land a shot you know guys  that can fight as well even though you can certainly fight he would land a shot could you withstand one 
[03:37:30]  of his shot i mean because his shots are fucking down syndrome inducing i mean he throws fucking bombs  these guys train to receive and they train to give and they do this all the time we have i haven't  done that type of training in a very long time okay but to get a punch from him that would be  devastating i would have to stay away from him i would have to kick him in his chin and poke him  in the eye and hit him with a baseball bat well that's that's what i'm saying even in the rules  without rules paul because paul would weapons be different but paul would have to get close enough 
[03:38:00]  to lock him up somehow and um he just here's this giant um this is um this andre the giant  this kid this guy's 7'2 against this asian  fedor laughs at this look at it's like a kid fighting his dad  look at this monster just makes the guy fall on him until he can look at the size of that  watch watch closely just positions himself he's he's fighting a seven foot two guy that looks 
[03:38:30]  kind of retarded a monster retard and he's on the bottom right now and that's uh yeah the 7'2  guy is on fedor but he brought fedor brought him on right he pulled him down a chinese big show  and and he's gonna kick his ass because he knows fedor knows he can get this guy he's got this giant  chinese guy on him because he knows he'll make a mistake that's the biggest head i've ever seen in  he's awful he's just locking him up holding him waiting for this big dummy to make a mistake  right look look look first attempt now what happens for the first attempt he's just trying to arm he's 
[03:39:00]  just hanging on his arm like it's a fly like a child look how big this guy's a giant compared  to fedor and he's a fucking all right they're back up on their feet gotta do a little radio play by  play for everybody fedor tried to arm bar him fedor looks soft i don't want to keep saying this like  but the motherfucker looks like if you hit him in his stomach he'll go down yeah how much longer  it looks like any dad you'd see at the beach that's a big dude a big muscular chinese man 
[03:39:30]  and fedor's just charging him now and now he throws the guy and again he pulled him down right on top  of him oh the chinese guys the guy's trying to punch him so he grabs his arm and stops him right  he's fucking not he just knows he's got this big dummy he he loves why does he like getting these  guys on top of him because he knows he can arm bar him he's gonna fucking lock his arm up oh is  that what he's waiting for this fucking this 10 feet of arm there  i feel like i got a cheat code for a video game and made one of the guys really big 
[03:40:00]  there we go seconds there you go he's got more there you go done that was it that's it why was  that done because fedor fucking wraps his legs around the guy's shoulders and straighten his arm out  had that guy not tapped his arm would have been broken backwards at the elbow well let's break  it holy shit watch watch what we do it because it's so fast it's in slow motion look at watch how  fucking he gets that arm straight there oh there's the arm and you don't even know that your arm is in 
[03:40:30]  the position this is what i mean like wait a minute wait wait my arm it's gonna be broken  this is what i mean about they know it's like you can watch somebody who doesn't know how to fight and  go dude i already beat you up just look at this fucking monster  get the kevin randleman fight can we show these guys out here guys a monster  that's a good one bro because kevin randleman is a fucking a monster wrestler  fedor i don't understand i don't know how the fuck he's the baddest dude going  in the zulu fight what's that no not zulu you got to see randleman who's a fucking wrestler 
[03:41:00]  some people say that's the best knockout ever against zulu oh i don't i don't know that one  fedor versus zulu randleman's not that long of a fight and there's a great suplex in it  but i want to see a knockout the thing about this randleman fight is how much pain fader takes  that's the yeah because you'll see you'll see how long has uh fedor been fighting i i don't know but  he's been prize champion for five years 31 oh shit he's been fighting a long time he's still he's  getting to his um what's what's your peak as a as a fighter so jimmy the ufc wants him bad right 
[03:41:30]  they said the russian mob wants too much for him i said look at the size of this oh jesus christ  randleman's a big kid and look at no this fedor has no he could easily be watching something on  television that's wesley snipes from fucking uh demolition man but he's a strong  now you want the demolition man that's one of my favorite animations  now right now they're just kind of boxing can you guys see out there yeah these guys are just 
[03:42:00]  kind of boxing a little bit now randleman has got him up against the ropes he picked him up picked  up fedor and uh fedor and he slammed fedor to the ground which seems to be a silly thing to do  yeah it's a dumb thing to do is to slam him on his head and get on top of him get on top of him  that's something you don't want to do with this guy it seems it's almost like a woman that lets you  almost rape her  yeah and right now you got fedor's on his back and ran and he just he pushed randleman wow and he got  up because he's very strong but watch this watch this oh that's a back-breaking he just picked 
[03:42:30]  fedor up and fell backwards with him on his neck a little wrestling move like a wwe wrestling move  how many of these guys have broken their necks over there i don't think none but right now look  there we go the fucking oh hey fedor's just god now he's on top of randleman he got he got out of  the thing after he's doing a face fuck now he's punching his face to release his arms because his  he's he's face fucking him he's definitely face fucking oh he's punching him in the head as he's  getting a blowjob yeah that is the worst what man hasn't wanted to do that and i mean 
[03:43:00]  no teeth asshole there you go he's straightening his arm which is always a problem yes when a guy's  his dick in your face and he's straightening your arm to break it all right he's just locking him  on there you go there you go oh fuck me locks him up ouch ouch he's a submission expert that guy's a beast  nothing now now do you see now imagine here's the thing about street fighting who gives a fuck whether  it's street fighting rules or not what street fighting technique would have got you out of there 
[03:43:30]  get out of there a dick bite but that's what the fuck he's gonna break your fucking arm and they  ain't gonna stop at a tap he's gonna break your fucking arm and then lock the other one up break  that fucking thing your legs because you didn't break them leave you there with broken arms and  broken legs in the middle of a fucking alley he's fighting patrice right now holy shit oh shit  this is how we're looking oh damn no oh this is what we need right here this is a great way to end 
[03:44:00]  it this guy looks a lot like patrice patrice made himself on the wii look up zulu it's a me  look up zulu it looks a bit like no oh my god that guy is huge the only five look he's not even  looking him in the eye fedor he's looking at the guy's chest this guy should be throwing white  people in a pot that's how big this well a big bone in his fucking nose his little hands were  little cute hands i want to snuggle him all right fedor the fedor looks like he should be doing 
[03:44:30]  someone's taxes the other guy's trying to stare him down yeah that's and he's just looking at the  guy's chest i don't it does not intimidate me here's fedor versus zulu oh boy how was the fight  on youtube oh it's oh yeah it's gonna be over very soon this guy is uh they just started you  started hey hey hey oh he fell right down down already and he's doing oh oh he's he's his  hitting he's doing what we all wanted to do to patrice on tough crowd
