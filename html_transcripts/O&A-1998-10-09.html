<pre> It's so nice to get to this point in the week isn't it Anthony?  Yeah.  It certainly is.  I get the first FU, I'll throw out the first FU.  Lob it out.  It's a pretty basic one but it's okay.  FU to Elda and ENY from the Tax Compliance Managers.  We work our butts off all year for you and you won't even buy us a drink.  FU.  Damn.  That's cold.  That is cold.  Fax line for the FU is 212-957-WNEW.  Request line, you know that by now I hope.  212-957-1027 and you can send your FU's through the Instant Feedback. 
[00:30]
 www.com.  Click on our pictures and you can instantly email us.  I thought about you last night.  Eww.  Tooling around the tube.  Well, I wonder how many other people laughed when they saw Colombo on the tube last night.  Lieutenant Colombo.  All I can think of is dirty Colombo.  I love Colombo.  I watched it last night.  Now was it good?  Because I just couldn't stomach it.  I checked it out for a couple of minutes and I had to move on. 
[01:00]
 Well, it's alright.  You know, it's the same as the old Joe except he's a thousand years old.  Yeah.  It's kind of, you know, he's not as quick on his feet anymore.  It's not like, pardon me, excuse me, ma'am.  One more question.  Now it's like, pardon me, excuse me, ma'am.  What?  It sounded more and more like George Burns actually.  Hey, pardon me, ma'am.  It's very close, right?  Yeah, yeah, he is.  He's getting really gravelly in his voice.  I don't know how much longer he's going to.  I think it's time to trade in the coat.  Yeah.  He needs a new coat.  Yeah, he's had that one for about 40 years. 
[01:30]
 Give up the coat.  It's all cute and all, but Colombo, it's getting old.  I heard him on a little interview on Wins last night.  We were driving home and he talked about how he bought the coat right on 57.  Supposedly right around here.  Yeah, but you can barely understand him.  I came out of there, bought a coat, and it was raining and I needed a coat so I ducked  into the shop and bought it.  Little different than dirty Colombo.  There you go.  No one's requesting dirty Colombo.  I think we'll get that out of the way in a minute here.  Okay.  We'll do it in a little bit, okay? 
[02:00]
 And keep the FUs coming.  Best way, once again, is the fax line.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony on FU Friday.  FU Friday.  And later this hour when you hear Banga Gong by T-Rex.  Be the 10th caller at 212-757-1027 to win a pair of tickets to see Aerosmith at Jones  Beach on Tuesday.  We're doing that all weekend long for you.  And the FU's coming in like crazy right now.  Yeah, Larry and Jersey, FU to everyone who's still discussing the play. 
[02:30]
 Get over it.  The game is lost.  Let's worry about tonight's game.  Go Yanks.  The best part of that today in the papers?  The team psychologist getting involved.  There's a team shrink.  A team shrink?  Give me a break.  They showed his picture on the paper but my question is why does he have a mitt?  He's got like a glove.  I don't know.  Why does the shrink need a mitt?  Maybe he's going to teach him how to pick up balls in the infield.  I don't know.  See, now you have to pick up the ball. 
[03:00]
 When the ball bounces behind you, see my glove.  I will now pick up the ball.  See, there must have been a problem in your youth.  That's actually what they're trying to say.  Like that he had a problem as a child and that's why he reacted to it like that.  Psychiatrists now are critiquing the play.  No, he just had a brain fart.  That's all it is.  See the headline in Newsday?  Turnover Newsday.  It's hysterical.  You got it right there.  Oh yeah.  Now he does it.  It's a picture of Chuck and he's picking up balls. 
[03:30]
 Right.  I practice and the headline is now he does it.  What did they, shove him out on the field just to pick balls up all day?  So get out there and pick up balls.  That's his little punishment I guess.  He's apologizing all over TV.  See how I do it?  I'm sorry.  It's like Bill.  Bill Clinton.  I got a problem with their balls.  They're apologizing for them.  Very nice.  Go Yanks Go.  Game three tonight.  We're going to do just fine.  That's for sure.  I got a bunch of FUs here. 
[04:00]
 A big FU to my ex-boyfriend Eric who's getting married in December who did nothing but manipulate  and suck me dry for two years.  Whoa.  Good luck to his new sucker.  Thanks you guys are great.  How about Nick and Parsiphony?  I want to send a big FU to the creators of that horrible movie A Night at the Roxbury.  That movie blew.  I should have listened to you guys.  Last week we begged you guys not to go watch that movie.  I was astounded that it drew in ten million dollars. 
[04:30]
 Ten million dollars that movie got.  A Night at the Roxbury.  And now they're trying to, they got the ads on TV.  If you like something about Mary, you'll love A Night at the Roxbury.  They're totally different movies.  One was really funny.  And the other one just I won't even see.  And the other one blows.  If you like The Godfather, you'll love A Night at the Roxbury.  They're trying anything at this point.  Anything.  Girls, did you like Titanic? 
[05:00]
 Come see A Night at the Roxbury.  So it's incredibly funny.  And you know every time I see the commercial now, you just, that head shaking thing gets  funnier and funnier.  It sure does.  And I love that.  I can't wait.  Beach in those like ball bag bathing suits.  Yeah, the banana hammocks.  I wet myself.  I sit there and I have to change my pants because I just wet.  I uncontrollably wet and crap myself.  Who in Hollywood decided, you know, they finally saw the finished product and they show the 
[05:30]
 two guys turning around at the beach and then you can see their ass and it's a little dental  floss happening in the back.  Who decided that that was going to be a big laugh in a movie theater?  To scream opium.  Humor beyond anything we can comprehend.  It's stupid.  Um, well, this F.U. was just handed to me.  Oh, what the heck?  I got the balls to read it.  Hi, guys.  Thank God.  It's Friday.  I've been waiting for this all week.  I would like to give a big F.U. to Richie Tonnes of Queens.  I feel so sorry for your girlfriend because she was no, she has no idea what an a-hole 
[06:00]
 you are.  P.S. if she is listening or anyone who knows her, I have been sleeping with him since I  met him at Club Getaway.  Thanks.  Ouch.  This could be, I'm saving this.  This could be the best F.U. of the day right now.  I'm putting that right there.  So, all right.  Wow.  That's toxic.  That'll leave a bruise.  Getting back into the tunes. 
[06:30]
 It's T-Rex, Banga Gang on the Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, the latest from R.E.M.  That's Dave Sleeper off the Up-C-D.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  It's open Anthony on F.U. Friday.  Lots coming through the email Anthony.  We want to send a big F.U. to Tim McWalters at New Jersey Transit from the boys.  You low life, scum sucking, shanty Irish bastard.  Wow.  Very nice.  I think they actually like him. 
[07:00]
 I think so.  That's how I talk with my pals.  Well it's F.U. Friday, your opportunity to vent your week's anger at your boss, your  spouse, the jerk that's in front of you slowing you down on your commute.  How about this?  This person likes us, likes the combo of music and our funny stuff.  Especially the prank regarding Red yesterday.  Red, yes.  Red's voicemail.  That might be the call of the week.  People are voting for that as well today.  Also says F. Scott Muni and his car. 
[07:30]
 For going the wrong way.  I guess so.  Thank you very much.  And now Anthony, the WNEW Weekend Weather Check, sponsored by Starship Troopers Home Video.  We don't do weather on the show.  When are they going to get this?  All right, the forecast is...  Um...  Looks a little wet, I'd say.  A little wet.  A little wet?  Yeah.  Okay.  This weekend by Starship Troopers, the eye-popping sci-fi thriller.  Now on videocassette and DVD from Columbia TriStar. 
[08:00]
 Actually, this is a comedy, this movie.  Yeah, it's pretty funny.  It's definitely worth checking out if you've never seen it before.  I rented it.  Lots of heads popped off and big bugs getting...  Blood and guts, but you're laughing half the time.  All right, on the way, I think we're going to do the F lesson today.  We haven't played that in a while.  Got to congratulate Joe Kiros of Lindenhurst, New York.  He was paying attention and he now has a pair of tickets to see.  Aerosmith, you're distracting me over there.  What are you doing?  I'm sorry, I'm in the middle of doing some computer stuff. 
[08:30]
 Okay.  ...these multipurpose applications.  How can anyone be offended when you use the word?  We say, use this unique, flexible word.  More often than your daily speech.  It will identify the quality of your character immediately.  Say it loudly and proudly.  F*** you.  Hey, this is Red the voicemail.  I'm not in my office right now.  You're listening to all Ben Anthony on FU Friday. 
[09:00]
 I'm 1027WNEW.  All right, name the TV show.  Name the TV show.  Not necessarily the news.  Very good.  The Rock of New York 1027WNEW with Eric Clapton, Motherless Children.  And knowing Eric Clapton, I don't think he's happy that people now refer to that song as the theme song for not necessarily the news, but...  I don't think he cares.  That's a great rock. Yeah, I don't think he cares either.  Actually, you're right. 
[09:30]
 Hey, Ben Anthony, it's FU Friday.  Here's one coming in from Kathy.  F you to my husband Ken.  You could take that three pack of condoms you bought for the weekend and shove it.  Love your wife Kathy.  He must have done something bad.  Yeah, Kathy, what did he do?  You got to give us details.  We need details.  A lot of people are angry today.  I think so.  Joe, my buddy from the attorney general's office, says F you to Donald Jones.  He's the Queens burglar they just arrested.  I was one of the people he robbed.  He came into my apartment and robbed me at gunpoint on August 16th, four days before my 40th birthday. 
[10:00]
 Well, now you're caught.  See 836 Newsday for a picture.  And F you.  Where's my gold chain, you...  F.  See you in hell.  Wow.  There you go.  That's pretty interesting.  At least they got him.  Yeah, so now he's going to get his salad tossed in prison.  Tossed salad.  Tossed salad.  I like mine with syrup.  Syrup.  We're listening to Chris Rock in the way.  And so we're in rare form today.  Sam. 
[10:30]
 We love Chris Rock.  We got to get him on the show again.  Yeah.  We talked to him a couple years back.  He's classic.  Opie and Anthony, we would like to send an F you to you guys.  Opie and Anthony.  Why?  Why you say?  Well, we have waited all week for a pork joke.  Just one.  We have sent you pork jokes, pork menus, and pages full of pork written in different sizes  and shapes.  Pork.  But no.  Pork.  We called.  You answered.  We said we wanted pork.  You said, hold on.  We did. 
[11:00]
 For an hour.  You porked us.  Now we F you.  A big F you goes out to Opie and Anthony.  Faithful listeners, but agitated.  Bob and Beth.  F you.  I too busy to deliver pork to get on the radio and say, Paul, I ride a bicycle down crowded  during a run down to a river fresh hot tongue pong pork on the moon tongue pork and our favorite 
[11:30]
 Musho tongue pong pork.  You know, after our tower records appearance this past Wednesday, we're walking the streets  of Manhattan and Anthony was doing it so loud.  I thought you were going to get punched by the pork guys.  Every time we saw one.  We're all like cheering Anthony on.  Come on, man.  Do it.  We're all like, where are you going with that pork?  And I noticed you were braver after dinner after we had a few cocktails than before dinner.  A couple of beers.  Yeah.  Couple of beers.  And then I'm right there.  Hey, Tang. 
[12:00]
 Well, give to me your pork.  Are you order a pork of swat rice tongue pong pork?  Now I got a question for the pork man.  How many pork dishes can you ramble off in like 30 seconds?  I need a menu.  You need a menu.  You want someone to fax a menu so you could do that for us.  Fax a menu with as many pork dishes.  I will read from a menu.  I can't want pork.  I'm on tongue pork. 
[12:30]
 We'll go pork.  Tang, tang, pong, pong, and a long tongue one.  Tang, wa, pork.  Thanks, if you could send us a Chinese menu because I want to see pork man do this today.  212-957-W-W.  I want to send an FU out to all the Democrats that are chicken to vote for the impeachment hearings.  Why?  Against Clinton.  Really?  31 guys voted for the hearings and the rest of them followed party lines and they were too scared to step forward. 
[13:00]
 Well, both sides are just following party lines.  It's retarded.  Except for 31 guys.  31 guys decided to go the other way.  And I applaud those guys today.  Do you?  Yeah, definitely.  I haven't even been paying attention.  Well, it's going to get ugly.  They're talking about this big historic thing, this impeachment proceedings.  First of all, half of the guys on the floor aren't even there during this thing.  They get up and babble their speeches.  No one's watching.  No one's listening. 
[13:30]
 No one cares.  Excuse me.  Hey, does anybody realize?  I got to state this.  I don't think anyone's saying this.  Iraq, remember Iraq?  They're like inches away from having a nuclear bomb.  They're about a week away, I think, at this point.  At this point, I don't even know what it is.  But biological weapons, they have them.  Nuclear weapons, they almost have the A bomb.  But we're not paying attention to them because we're distracted here in America.  Well, I got a couple more fundraisers to go to before I could worry about a bomb. 
[14:00]
 What did you say, bong?  Yeah, I smoked it but I didn't.  All this crap going on and no one realizes.  Do you know there's a war ready to be kicked up between Iran and Afghanistan?  That's going to happen and that's going to affect us.  Yugoslavia, once again, is just in turmoil.  There's children getting their heads hacked off over there.  Hey, what about my head? 
[14:30]
 I'm getting head too.  And everyone's just to ears.  I'm going to pick Clinton's picture again with that stupid face where he clenches his bottom lip.  I love to feel your pain.  I'm sorry.  I had an affair against my wife.  All this crap is going on in the world.  The market's taking a dump.  I dumped two all over my head. 
[15:00]
 I mean, come on.  We got to talk about Halloween costumes.  Me and Anthony have a little rant about Halloween costumes.  We'll do that in a bit.  Keep the FU's coming and we'll keep the music playing for you.  We got some Red Ryder on the way and some Rush By requests next.  1027WNEW, the Rock of New York with the Doors.  Touch Me, that was the song you had to be listening for this hour to pick up the Aerosmith tickets.  Rick's got a winner in the other room. 
[15:30]
 He'll be running in here any second with that.  Next hour, you got to listen for the Rolling Stones' Hang Fire.  When you do, be the 10th caller at 212-757-1027.  And you too will win a pair of tickets to see Aerosmith.  Cool.  Sophie and Anthony on FU Friday.  Very, very busy day.  People are angry this week.  I'm sensing that.  I like that.  They're actually taking advantage of FU Friday.  Denise Bartolotta of Bayside.  She's got the Aerosmith tickets.  Congratulations, Denise.  Sorry about that. 
[16:00]
 I got to declare something here.  What?  I was watching the news before we got in today.  And I must say, a lot of people will be dressing up for Halloween once again this year.  Yes, yes.  If you go to a Halloween party dressed as Monica or President Clinton, you are the biggest dork in New York.  I got to agree.  I was watching the news and they're talking about the hottest costumes for this Halloween.  And of course, dressing up like Monica and putting on a Clinton mask are the favorites this year. 
[16:30]
 Not only just the Clinton mask, you've got to put the suit jacket on, but then just walk around in boxer shorts.  With a cigar.  That's just whack, whack, Zanerrific.  You show up to a party like that, come on, get a life.  I'm retarded.  And then of course a bunch of girls are going to be walking around with their little berets. 
[17:00]
 And the blue dress.  And a blue dress with a big stain on it.  Whoa, hey, that's original, that's great.  And it will be even funnier.  The more stain the girl has.  Like if you unload a full container of Cool Whip on your body before you go to your wacky party, that will be hysterical.  Just whole zany.  And then at the party they'll get the Clinton guy together with the Monica girl and all take pictures with them.  Yeah, it'll be cute.  Great. 
[17:30]
 And they'll come in like fifth place in the costume contest.  Coming in fifth, it's Bill and Monica, come on up here, give them a big hand.  Oh, look at her.  Look, she's trying to get up on stage, but Bill's sticking her with a cigar as she walks up the stairs.  That's insane, you kids.  You're wacky, zany.  Don't do it to yourself.  Don't dress as Monica or the president this Halloween season.  I don't even dress up for Halloween.  No, I don't.  I just can't do that anymore.  I go to the parties, you know. 
[18:00]
 Yeah.  I can't understand the people that do this whole huge thing.  It's like, what are you?  I'm the space shuttle.  And like it's a huge space shuttle with his face sticking out of it.  Hey, look, and my booster rockets work.  We've got to walk around in a big box.  Or hey, look, I'm a toilet.  This year I'm the toilet.  Look, flush me.  I like the people.  They go to these big clubs and stuff, you know, pay all the money.  And then their costume is like a tree and they stand in the corner for the whole night  and they don't even enjoy themselves. 
[18:30]
 Yeah, you can't even move in some of these things.  Look at me.  I'm the Titanic.  Right.  Actual size.  This is great, isn't it?  Could you just pour a drink down my smokestack?  I'm pretty thirsty.  And no, that isn't the bilge draining out the bottom.  I'm actually taking a leak.  Can't fit in the bathroom.  I like a simple costume.  Me.  Yeah, there you go.  Just going.  So have fun. 
[19:00]
 There it is, a PSA from the Opie and Anthony show.  Don't do it to yourselves.  Last week's tip, we told you guys not to see Night at the Roxbury.  Yes.  Some of you did not listen and now you're...  You sat through it.  You sat through it, hating it.  And this is our tip this week.  Do not go, as Bill and Monica, to your Halloween party this year.  Thank you.  Okay.  You know, a lot of people are requesting the dot dot date thing again.  Yeah, isn't that something?  I think we're going to add another piece of that puzzle today.  The actual bit that we did that made our boss Dave call us in the first place. 
[19:30]
 Yes.  Why he was calling saying we should ease off on the subject we were talking about.  Yes, that's a little tease, so stick around for that if you know what we're talking about.  Also, some blondie on the way and I think...  Oh, we're running late actually.  We'll get some who on next.  Stay there.  OP, Larry in Jersey emailed us saying anyone who goes as Monica to Halloween party should  be required to give a Lewinsky to anyone they encounter dressed as Bill.  Very good.  I think I might have to dress as Bill then. 
[20:00]
 The Rock of New York, 1027WNEW, Lonesome George Thorogood, One Bourbon, One Scotch, and One  Beer.  It's Opian Anthony on FU Friday.  Keep the Facts in the Coming, 212-957WNEW.  Lots going on.  There's a whole pile of Facts to get to.  We'll try in a minute here, but the phone is also ringing like crazy.  Let's take one.  NEW.  Hey guys.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Good.  Mr. K, do me a favor.  Can you play that da-da-da medley you had yesterday?  I left my ass off with that. 
[20:30]
 So if you guys can play that, that will make my weekend start out really, really good.  All right, brother.  We'll play that.  Beauty, guys.  Thank you.  Be good.  Man, everybody is requesting that today.  And it would be bit of the week, but it's actually an old Opian Anthony bit, so it's  not in the running.  Yeah, this is our old boss.  Well we got a new piece of the puzzle today.  I have found the bit he was complaining about.  Oh brother.  So, well, if you remember that Volkswagen commercial with the two guys driving around  in the Volkswagen to the da-da-da song, and they find the little chair and they put it 
[21:00]
 in the back of the car, and then they, I guess the chair stinks or something.  Yeah, they get rid of the chair.  They get rid of it.  Everyone's seen it, and in between, you know, they're playing with little toys in the front  seat and making little judo moves at each other and stuff.  I was just saying on the air that I thought it was a gay commercial.  Yes.  Not that it was a bad commercial or anything like that, but that the two guys, I had them  pegged as a gay couple. 
[21:30]
 As a gay couple.  Others think it's actually a couple college guys, but.  I said no.  No way, because I mean, the point I want to make, if I'm driving with you, and I might  make cute little karate moves to you, what are you going to do?  I'm probably going to smack you upside your head.  And if I play with little squishy toys, what would you think?  It's just something that I think most straight guys wouldn't do to their pal while they're  driving around the city.  Our own opinion.  So me and Anthony decided to play the song that's in that commercial, da-da, and see 
[22:00]
 what comes out by a trio, right?  Yeah.  This was one take.  It's pretty obvious, but that's okay.  So listen to the song.  We remade it.  And then right after that, our boss called to complain about this bit.  Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Uh huh.  I'll just play in your face with this toy as we drive. 
[22:30]

[23:00]

[23:30]

[24:00]
 All right.  Albeit annoying as hell, the boss got a little upset about the content.  Yes.  Thought it was a little too much, as he said, entering the gay zone.  Yeah.  So we taped our old boss and we messed with him a little bit.  Check it out.  Hello.  Hello.  What's up?  I just wanted to...  Why are you on this line?  Well, I figured it was easier than getting out of my chair and coming down the hall. 
[24:30]
 Oh.  Just wanted to make a request.  Yeah.  Maybe we could steer the show in a little different direction so that this doesn't get  out of hand.  What's getting out of hand?  Well, I think we're going into the gay zone and we all know where that leads, wouldn't  you agree?  Not really, but...  Pokey, pokey in the butt?  No, no.  Licky, licky?  That's fun stuff.  Yeah, it's fun, but you know what?  It's going to get us in trouble. 
[25:00]
 Just, you know, steer somewhere else.  If you keep going this direction, there's going to be trouble.  I'm just warning you.  Not from me.  I'm talking about outside.  We've been down this road before.  The old dirt road.  Yeah.  Just giving you a little heads up here.  All right.  Okay.  Head.  See you.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Hello.  We're going into the gay zone.  We're going into the gay zone.  We're going into the gay zone.  We're going into the gay zone.  We're going into the gay zone.  You know,cze dice.  We're going into the gay zone. 
[25:30]
 Ce diceraulairuse.  We're going into the gay zone.  We're going into the gay zone.  One or two, uh, you know, pokey, pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  Gaze ray, gaze zh, Gaze zhon.  You know.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey, Pokey in the butt, yeah Pokey, Pokey in the butt, yeah 
[26:00]
 Gaze, gaze, gaze on Pokey, Pokey in the butt  Pokey, Pokey in the butt  Licky, licky, licky, lick, lick, lick Pokey, Pokey in the butt, yeah  Licky, licky, yes, but Licky, licky, yes, but  Pokey, Pokey in the butt  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York  Kenny Wayne Shepard, somehow, somewhere, someway  for your ride home today  It's Opie and Anthony, FU Friday in progress  Oh, this is lovely, huh  Deborah Marshall from Jersey 
[26:30]
 Anthony, are you the same guy who went on Howard Stern's morning show a couple of years ago to do your Jackie impression?  What's with that? How can you be successful now? You were such a broken down suitcase then  You hated life back then  Oh man, see, fairy tales can come true, it can happen to you  Yes, you were installing air conditioners at that point  I was in air conditioning and heating tech  And now you're doing radio  Go figure how that works 
[27:00]
 I have no idea how that happened  I was a radio guy trapped in the body of an air conditioning technician  Yeah  Oh, and now the WNEW weekend weather check sponsored by Starship Troopers Home Video  Do I have to go to the window?  The forecast is, yeah, the sales staff doesn't understand we don't do weather on our show  and they give us these stupid things to read  Alright, hold on  Alright, I want you to let everyone know what the weather is all about  Wait a minute  Alright, gosh  Alright  Yup  It's uh, it looks like drizzle 
[27:30]
 Okay  It's um, and it doesn't look like there's any sign of it clearing up  Alright  I see some trees on top of that building  What's with that trees on top of building?  What is it, an illusion? You think you're in a forest?  Alright Seinfeld, continue  Continue  Who are these people that put trees on buildings?  You never see a building on a tree?  Uh, it's kind of windy  Kind of windy  Kind of windy  Alright, there's your weather 
[28:00]
 This weekend by Starship Troopers, the eye-popping sci-fi thriller  now on videocassette and DVD from Columbia TriStar  Can you tell we don't give a niff?  And can you feel the love here?  Hey, we got Bit of the Week on the way  Alright  It's very obvious what Bit of the Week was  Well, we did get a phone call, didn't we?  Yeah, we'll play that hopefully before 6 o'clock  We're running a little late here  And I think today's a special day  A little wet and slick on the roadways  Everyone is slowing down  I don't understand that concept 
[28:30]
 But people like to drive even slower when there's a little drizzle in the air  Like a few dots of water hit their windshield  And they just jam on the brakes  And don't forget, you're listening for Hang Fire  by the Rolling Stones for the Aerosmith tickets  And if you hear that song, be the 10th caller at 212-757-1027  And you will score the tickets  In the meantime, it's the Ramones on the Rock of New York  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York  Whole Celebrity Skin, it's opiate Anthony on FU Friday  The facts are still spilling in here 
[29:00]
 If you want to add one to the list  212-957-WNEW  This guy writes, thanks for Heston traffic  It's a madhouse!  Damn!  He writes in parentheses  Now how about Homo Mondays?  Out your boss, friends, enemies  I see lawsuits  No guts, no glory  FU, Friday rules by the way  And this one's good  It's raining, my girl dumped me  I lost my job  And I'm going for the pipe next week  F everyone 
[29:30]
 And I think his name's Lucky, I don't know  Lucky  He's calling himself Lucky today anyway  That's zany  I think in the last hour of the show  We'll definitely get to a lot of FUs  Use the fax line 212-957-WNEW  Or if you're home already  And not stuck in traffic  Like half the people listening to us right now  At your computer  WNEW.com  Click on our pictures  And instantly email us  Alright, I do believe Anthony  It is time for Bit of the Week  Oh, we all know what this is going to be  Yes, let's cue Spacey Kasem here

All right  That few Fridays going quite well  And what do you got over there on instant feedback?  Well, first Bob in New Jersey  We nearly killed him  From what I'm gathering here  We can't kill any of our faithful listeners  We need every single one of you guys at this point  Yeah  You guys nearly killed me  Your Dirty Columbo sketch came on  When I was driving on a busy road 
[34:00]
 I laughed so hard  I had trouble holding on to the wheel  And my eyes watered up  What would I tell the cops if I crashed?  Funny sketch, though  Thank you  You know what?  You think we could end the show with Dirty Columbo  Or have we played it too much in the last couple days?  We could probably end it  Because we'll never ever play it again  Yeah, that's true  Well, we did it because of the Columbo movie last night  So until he makes another one  We'll have to rest that one  Yes  So we'll end the show with that  That'll be a good way to end it  At 7 o'clock 
[34:30]
 Also, the FU is still coming in  You got a good one you're saying over there?  Oh my God  This one is awful  This has to be the worst one  I can't use her name  Okay  It says, please don't use my name  I don't want to give too much ammo for the divorce lawyer  Uh-oh  He will hire  A big FU to my husband  Who's too lame to accompany me to a formal party  So FU, I got a date  And FU because  I F'd my date last night while you were out drinking with your friends 
[35:00]
 In fact, when you came home and crawled into bed  And asked me about the wet spot  And I told you that it was a drink I spilled  Well, it wasn't  It wasn't  In fact, I have F'd my date more times this past week  Than we had F'd in the past 6 months  So FU because tonight I'm too tired  Come on  He sat in the wet spot  In his own bed with his wife 
[35:30]
 Wait a minute  Now that could be the  Guys love porridge and he sits in it  While he gets into his own bed  Oh, that did get worse than that  I don't think so  That might be the FU of the day  Hey honey boy, I'm tired  What's this?  Oh, no  I was drinking iced tea before I went to bed  That was a Pina Colada 
[36:00]
 So is that the FU of the day?  Because I saved this one from earlier  Doesn't taste like Pina Colada  What do you got?  That's brutal  Well, this might have to be the runner up  Because I thought this was going to be the one  Hi guys, thank God it's Friday  I've been waiting for this all week  I would like to give a big FU to Richie Tonnes of Queens  I feel so sorry for your girlfriend  Because she has no idea what an a-hole you are 
[36:30]
 P.S. if she is listening or anyone who knows her  I have been sleeping with him since I met him at Club Getaway  People are just having sex all over  You guys are vicious today, I love it  This has been an exceptionally brutal FU Friday  I love it  Yes, well that's why it's here  We can't sugar coat this  Everyone gets really ticked off during the week  And we give you a chance to vent on our lovely show on Friday  That's it  That's it  Alright, enough of that  We've got to play some rock and roll here 
[37:00]
 What do you got?  Well Anthony, I've got some police  And I've got some Sean Mullins if people stick around  Hi, N.E.W  Oh man, I've got to tell you  That FU for the girl whose husband sat in the wet spot  Definitely has to be the winner  That is the worst thing that could possibly happen  Oh man, this guy has got to be the biggest fool  Insult to injury there man  Oh yeah, that has to be the winner man 
[37:30]
 In his own bed  His own bed, his own wife  He's sitting in somebody else's jolly juice  I'm telling you, I was laughing so hard man  That was definitely the funniest  Thank God it's Friday  Alright man, have a great weekend  Alright, you too man  Here's Sean Mullins and Lullaby  On the Rock of New York, 1027 W.N.E.W  1027 W.N.E.W, the Rock of New York with the police  So lonely, I think we've got to send that song out to the wife 
[38:00]
 From the instant email that you read about 15 minutes ago  The wife? I don't think she's lonely at all  No, not at all  The husband maybe  Maybe the husband  This is horrible  We're getting such a reaction on this too  It is FU Friday and this woman sent an FU  But said please don't use her name  She doesn't want to give ammo for the divorced lawyer  A big FU to my husband who's too lame to accompany me to a formal party  So FU, I got a date  And FU because I F'd my date last night while you were out drinking with your friends 
[38:30]
 In fact, when you came home and crawled into bed  And asked me about the wet spot  And I told you that it was the drink I spilled  Well it wasn't  In fact, I have F'd my date more times this past week  Than we have F'd in the past six months  So FU because tonight I'm too tired  The guy crawls into bed  His bed  With his wife who just had sex with a guy 
[39:00]
 And lays in the pleasure porridge of this individual  The ultimate in degradation I would say  Well people are freaking out  This fax came in  What a bitch  Way to go honey  And there's a picture of a penis colada  Because you mentioned that earlier  Probably  What she said she spilled  Right, the penis colada  And it has the cocoa loaf as penis colada mix next to the drink with a spazoo  Hanging out of the glass 
[39:30]
 I like this one  John from Jersey's got it  If there was ever a case for justifiable homicide  It would be if that dude smelled the wet spot  And cut his wife into 35 small pieces  And then get this little Chris Rock mention  Because I'm not saying he should kill her  But I sure understand  Oh my God  That hits like way below the belt  For a guy  The whole image  That you crawl into bed every night with your wife 
[40:00]
 And you just slip into a wet spot like that  Or somebody else  Or some other guy's juice  Alright great  Well you're not getting off the hook  Everyone is calling, they're emailing, they're faxing  They want to hear one last pork guy  They want to hear pork guy  They want to hear pork guy  Well can we get pork guy out on the street with his bicycle  Well actually I do believe I got some actual audio from pork guy 
[40:30]
 Alright we're seeing how many different types of pork  He can wheel off as he weaves in and out of traffic  Yes  We've all seen the guys on their bikes with their little delivery baskets  Delivering Chinese food  Right  Alright I think this is the audio right here  Oh  Pork fried rice  Roast pork and broileries  Fried pork  Hunan pork  Double cooked pork  Out the way  Pork with garlic sauce  Pork with peachy sauce  Pork in hot pepper sauce  Mushroom pork

Ralph from Jersey said thank you  For the pork  Oh for the pork guy  I was crying rapping so hard  At a pork  Pah  Tang fang  Wah  Pork  Very good  Where we come?  Alright  We didn't get to stockbroker Dave today  I hope if he's listening he's not mad at us  No we had a busy day  There were FUs all over 
[43:00]
 All over  So I guess the last FU is stockbroker Dave telling us FU  I think it is  Actually we'll have his report Monday  He's got some interesting things to say about the market  And the world economy Anthony  My god on our show we're actually going to talk about the world economy  We're up to date with things  We're swinging  We are trying  We did promise we'd play Dirty Colombo one last time  One last time  We watched them last night on TV aging badly  And we'll put this in the Opium Anthony archives  So this will be the last time you hear this for a while
