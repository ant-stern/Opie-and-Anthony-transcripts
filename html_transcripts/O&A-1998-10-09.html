<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show's "FU Friday" broadcast was a raucous affair heavily driven by listener-submitted "FUs," ranging from petty grievances about ex-boyfriends and disliked films like *A Night at the Roxbury* to far more serious complaints, such as a listener recounting a robbery at gunpoint.  The hosts interwove these listener calls with their own brand of commentary.  Their opinions on the new *Columbo* series were mixed, criticizing the actor's age and slower pace, while teasing a future "Dirty Columbo" segment.  They also heavily mocked the New York Yankees' struggles and the team's psychologist's presence at practice.

The ongoing Clinton-Lewinsky scandal provided ample comedic fodder, with jokes and predictions about its popularity as a Halloween costume choice; the hosts strongly discouraged anyone from dressing as either Bill Clinton or Monica Lewinsky.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to the "Bit of the Week," a prank call to a person named Red involving numerous transfers and increasingly ridiculous excuses.  This proved to be a hit with listeners.

The hosts also revisited a previous bit about a Volkswagen commercial they interpreted as featuring a gay couple, playing a recording of their subsequent conversation with their boss, Dave, who sternly warned them about venturing into "the gay zone."  A recurring listener request for "pork jokes" was eventually fulfilled by playing a recording of a Chinese food delivery person listing various pork dishes while cycling through busy traffic.

The show was punctuated by numerous sexual innuendos and offensive language.  No guests appeared in studio.  Listener participation was a major element, with contests to win Aerosmith tickets based on song identification.  Throughout the broadcast, the hosts maintained a consistent tone of irreverent humor and shock value, fueled by both listener submissions and their own spontaneously generated material.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Ah, it's so nice to get to this point in the week, isn't it, Anthony?  Yeah, it certainly is.  I got the first F.U. I'll throw out the first F.U.  Lob it out.  It's a pretty basic one, but it's okay.  F.U. to Elda and E.N.Y. from the Tax Compliance Managers.  We work our butts off all year for you, and you won't even buy us a drink.  F.U.  Damn.  That's cold.  That is cold.  Fax line for the F.U. is 212-957-WNEW.  Request line, you know that by now, I hope.  212-757-1027. 
[00:00:30]  And you can send your F.U.s through the instant feedback.  Mm-hmm.  WNEW.com.  Click on our pictures, and you can instantly email us.  I thought about you last night.  Ew.  I'm tooling around the tube.  Well, I wonder how many other people laughed when they saw Columbo on the tube last night.  Lieutenant Columbo.  All I can think of is Dirty Columbo.  I love Columbo.  I watched it last night.  Now, was it good?  Because I just couldn't stomach it.  I checked it out for a couple minutes, and I had to move on. 
[00:01:00]  Well, it's all right.  You know, it's the same as the old show, except he's 1,000 years old now.  Yeah.  It's kind of, you know, he's not as quick on his feet anymore.  It's not like, pardon me, excuse me, ma'am, one more question.  Now, it's like, pardon me, excuse me, ma'am.  He sounded more and more like George Burns, actually.  Hey, pardon me, ma'am.  It's very close, right?  Yeah, yeah, he is.  He's getting really gravelly in his voice.  I don't know how much longer he's got.  I think it's time to trade in the coat.  Yeah.  He needs a new coat.  Yeah.  He's had that one for about 40 years. 
[00:01:30]  Give up the coat.  It's all cute and all, but Columbo, it's getting old.  I heard him on a little interview on WINS last night.  We were driving home, and he talked about how he bought the coat right on 57.  Supposedly right around here.  Yeah, but you can barely understand him.  I came out of there and bought a coat, and it was raining, and I needed a coat, so I  ducked into the shop and bought it.  A little different than Dirty Columbo.  There you go.  Well, everyone's requesting Dirty Columbo.  I think we'll get that out of the way in a minute here.  Okay.  We'll do it in a little bit, okay? 
[00:02:00]  And keep the FUs coming.  Best way, once again, is the fax line.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony on FU Frider.  Frider?  FU Frider.  And later this hour, when you hear Bang-A-Gong by T-Rex, be the 10th caller at 212-757-1027  to win a pair of tickets to see Aerosmith at Jones Beach on Tuesday.  We're doing that all weekend long for you.  And the FU's coming in like crazy right now.  Yeah, Larry in Jersey, FU to everyone who's still discussing the play. 
[00:02:30]  Get over it.  The game is lost.  Let's worry about tonight's game.  Go Yanks.  The best part of that today in the papers?  Yeah.  The team psychologist getting involved.  There's a team shrink.  A team shrink.  Give me a break.  They showed his picture in the paper, but my question is, why does he have a mitt?  He's got like a glove.  I don't know.  Why would the shrink need a mitt?  Maybe he's going to teach him how to pick up balls in the infield.  I don't know.  See, now you have to pick up the ball. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  When the ball bounces behind you, see my glove.  I will now pick up the ball.  See, there must have been a problem in your youth.  That's actually what they're trying to say.  Like that he had a problem as a child, and that's why he reacted to it.  Like that psychiatrist now are critiquing the play.  No, he just had a brain fart.  That's all it is.  Did you see the headline in Newsday?  Turnover Newsday.  It's hysterical.  You got it right there.  Oh, yeah.  Now he does it.  It's a picture of Chuck, and he's picking up balls. 
[00:03:30]  Right, at practice, and the headlines, now he does it.  What, did they shove him out on the field just to pick balls up all day?  So get out there and pick up balls.  That's his little punishment, I guess.  He's apologizing all over TV.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  It's like Bill.  Yeah, he's Bill Clinton.  They both have a problem with their balls.  They're apologizing for him.  Very nice.  Go, Yanks, go.  Game three tonight.  We're going to do just fine, that's for sure.  I got a bunch of FUs here. 
[00:04:00]  A big FU to my ex-boyfriend, Eric, who's getting married in December, who did nothing but manipulate  and suck me dry for two years.  Whoa.  Good luck to his new sucker.  Thanks.  You guys are great.  How about Nick in Parsippany?  I want to send a big FU to the creators of that horrible movie, A Night at the Roxbury.  That movie blew.  I should have listened to you guys.  Last week, we begged you guys not to go watch that movie.  I was astounded that it drew in $10 million. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  $10 million that movie got.  A Night at the Roxbury.  And now they're trying to, they got the ads on TV.  If you like something about Mary, you'll love A Night at the Roxbury.  They're totally different movies.  Nothing to do with one of them.  One was really funny.  And the other one just, I won't even see.  And the other one blows.  If you like The Godfather, you'll love A Night at the Roxbury.  They're trying anything at this point.  Girls, did you like Titanic? 
[00:05:00]  Come see A Night at the Roxbury.  So it's incredibly funny.  And you know, every time I see the commercial now, you just, that head shaking thing gets  funnier and funnier.  It sure does.  And I love that.  I can't wait.  And when they're on the beach in those like ball bag bathing suits.  Yeah, the banana hammocks.  I wet myself.  I sit there and I have to change my pants because I just wet, I uncontrollably wet and  crap myself.  Who in Hollywood decided, you know, they finally saw the finished product and they show the 
[00:05:30]  two guys turning around at the beach and then you can see their ass and it's a little  dental floss happening in the back.  Right.  Who decided that that was going to be a big laugh in a movie theater?  It's a scream, O.P.  It's humor beyond anything we can comprehend.  It's stupid.  Um, whoa.  This F.U. was just handed to me.  Oh, what the heck?  I got the balls to read it.  Hi, guys.  Thank God it's Friday.  I've been waiting for this all week.  Uh-oh.  I would like to give a big F.U.  to Richie Tannis of Queens.  I feel so sorry for your girlfriend because she was no, she has no idea what an a-hole you 
[00:06:00]  are.  P.S.  If she is listening or anyone who knows her, I have been sleeping with him since I met  him at Club Getaway.  Thanks.  Bye.  Oh, ouch.  This could be, I'm saving this.  Yeah.  This could be the best F.U. of the day right there.  I'd save that.  I'm putting that right there, so.  All right.  Wow.  That's toxic.  That'll leave a bruise.  Getting back into the tunes, it's T-Rex, Bang-A-Gone. 
[00:06:30]  On the Rock of New York, 1027-W-NEW.  1027-W-NEW.  The Rock of New York, the latest from R.E.M.  That's Dave Sleeper off the Up-C-D.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  It's Opie and Anthony on F.U. Friday.  Lots coming through the email, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  We want to send a big F.U. to Tim McWalters at New Jersey Transit from the boys, you low-life,  scum-sucking, shanty Irish bastard.  Wow.  Very nice.  I think they actually like him. 
[00:07:00]  I think so.  That's how I talk with my pals.  Well, it's F.U. Friday, your opportunity to vent your week's anger at your boss, your  spouse, the jerk that's in front of you, slowing you down on your commute.  How about this?  This person likes us, likes the combo of music and our funny stuff, and especially  the prank regarding Red yesterday.  Red, yes.  Red's voicemail.  That might be the call of the week.  People are voting for that as well today, so.  Also says F. Scott Muni and his car. 
[00:07:30]  For going the wrong way?  I guess so.  Thank you very much.  And now, Anthony, the WNEW Weekend Weather Check, sponsored by Starship Troopers Home  Video.  We don't do weather on the show.  When are they going to get this?  All right.  The forecast is...  Looks a little wet, I'd say.  A little wet.  A little wet?  Yeah.  Okay.  This weekend by Starship Troopers, the eye-popping sci-fi thriller, now on video cassette and 
[00:08:00]  DVD from Columbia TriStar.  Actually, this is a comedy, this movie.  Yeah, it's pretty funny.  It's definitely worth checking out if you've never seen it before.  I rented it.  Lots of heads popped off and, you know, big bugs getting...  Blood and guts, but you're laughing half the time, so.  All right.  On the way, I think we're going to do the F lesson today.  We haven't played that in a while.  Got to congratulate Joe Kieros of Lindenhurst, New York.  He was paying attention and he now has a pair of tickets to see Aerosmith.  You're distracting me over there.  What are you doing?  I'm sorry. 
[00:08:30]  I'm in the middle of doing some computer stuff.  Okay.  These multi-purpose applications, how can anyone be offended when you use the word?  We say, use this unique, flexible word more often than your daily speech.  It will identify the quality of your character immediately.  Say it loudly and proudly.  F*** you.  Hi, this is Red's voicemail.  I'm not mayor of the track now.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony on F.U. Friday on 1027-WNEW. 
[00:09:00]  All right.  Name the TV show.  Name the TV show.  Not necessarily the news.  Very good.  The Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW with Eric Clapton, Motherless Children.  And knowing Eric Clapton, I don't think he's happy that people now refer to that song as the theme song for not necessarily the news.  I don't think he cares.  That's a great ride.  Yeah, I don't think he cares either.  No.  Actually, you're right.  It's O.P. and Anthony. 
[00:09:30]  It's F.U. Friday.  Here's one coming in from Kathy.  F.U. to my husband, Ken.  You could take that three-pack of condoms you bought for the weekend and shove it.  Love your wife, Kathy.  He must have done something bad.  Yeah, Kathy.  What did he do?  You've got to give us details.  We need details.  A lot of people are angry today.  I think so.  Joe, our buddy from the Attorney General's office, says, F.U. to Donald Jones.  He's the Queens burglar they just arrested.  I was one of the people he robbed.  He broke into my apartment and robbed me at gunpoint on August 16th, four days before my 40th birthday. 
[00:10:00]  Well, now you're caught.  See 836 Newsday for picture.  And F.U.  Where's my gold chain, you F?  See you in hell.  Wow.  There you go.  That's pretty interesting.  At least they got him.  Yeah, so now he's going to get his salad tossed in prison.  Tossed salad.  Tossed salad.  I like mine with syrup.  Syrup.  Me and Anthony were listening to Chris Rock in the way, and so we're in rare form today.  Syrup.  We love Chris Rock. 
[00:10:30]  We've got to get him on the show again.  Yeah.  We talked to him a couple years back.  He's classic.  Opie and Anthony, we would like to send an F.U. to you guys, Opie and Anthony.  Why?  Why, you say?  Well, we have waited all week for a pork joke.  Just one.  We have sent you pork jokes, pork menus, and pages full of pork written in different sizes and shapes.  Pork.  But, no.  We called.  You answered.  We said we wanted pork.  You said, hold on.  We did.  For an hour. 
[00:11:00]  You porked us.  Now we F.U.  A big F.U. goes out to Opie and Anthony.  Faithful listeners, but agitated.  Bob and Beth.  If you are too busy on the river pork to get on the radio and say, pork, I ride a bicycle  down Crowder Street during a lunch hour to deliver fresh, hot Changpong pork on the  Moong Changpong and our favorite Mushu Changpong pork. 
[00:11:30]  You know, after our Tower Records appearance this past Wednesday, we're walking the streets  of Manhattan, and Anthony was doing it so loud, I thought you were going to get punched  by the pork guys.  Every time we saw one, we're all like cheering Anthony on going, come on, man, do it, do  it, do it.  He pedaled by.  Where are you going with that pork?  And I noticed you were braver after dinner, after we had a few cocktails, than before dinner.  A couple of beers, yeah.  A couple of beers.  Then I'm right there.  Hey, Tang! 
[00:12:00]  Give to me your pork!  Are you order a pork?  Swipe rice?  A Changpong pork!  Now, I got a question for the pork man.  Yeah.  How many pork dishes can you ramble off in like 30 seconds?  I need a menu.  You need a menu?  You want someone to fax a menu so you could do that for us?  Fax a tomato menu with as many pork dishes I will read from a menu.  Changpong pork, Manchang pork, Wuchu pork, Changpong pork, Changpong pork, Changpong pork, and 
[00:12:30]  a long-tongue, one-tongue, wah, pork!  Pah!  Fax line, if you could send us a Chinese menu, because I want to see Porkman do this today.  212-957-WNEW.  I want to send a nephew out to all the Democrats that were chicken to vote, you know, for the  impeachment hearings.  Why?  Against Clinton.  Really?  31 guys, you know, voted for the hearings, and the rest of them followed party lines, 
[00:13:00]  and they were too scared to step forward.  Well, both sides are just following party lines.  It's retarded.  Except for 31 guys.  31 guys decided to go the other way.  And I applaud those guys today.  Do you?  Yeah, definitely.  I haven't even been paying attention.  Well, it's going to get ugly.  They're talking about this big historic thing, this impeachment proceedings.  First of all, half of the guys on the floor aren't even there during this thing.  They get up and babble their speeches.  Yeah.  No one's watching.  No one's listening. 
[00:13:30]  No one cares.  Excuse me.  Hey.  Does anybody realize?  I've got to state this.  I don't think anyone's saying this.  Iraq.  Remember Iraq?  They're, like, inches away from having a nuclear bomb.  They're about a week away, I think, at this point.  At this point, I don't even know what it is.  Yeah.  But biological weapons, they have them.  Yes.  Nuclear weapons.  They almost have the A-bomb.  But we're not paying attention to them because we're distracted here in America.  Well, I got a couple more fundraisers to go to before I can worry about a bomb. 
[00:14:00]  What'd you say?  Bomb?  Yeah.  I smoked it, but I didn't inhale.  Hey, all this crap going on.  Yeah.  And no one realizes.  Do you know there's a war ready to be kicked up between Iran and Afghanistan?  That's going to happen.  Do you know Yugoslavia, once again, is just in turmoil?  There's children getting their heads hacked off over there.  Hey, what about my head? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm getting head, too.  And everyone's just...  There's Clinton's picture again with that stupid face where he clenches his bottom leg.  I love, feel your pain.  I'm sorry.  I was...  I had an affair against my wife.  Hey, well, all this crap's going on in the world.  The market's taking a dump.  Yeah.  Dump.  I dumped, too, all over. 
[00:15:00]  All right, all right.  I mean, come on.  Oh, no, we got to talk about it in a little while because you're on this subject.  We got to talk about Halloween costumes.  Oh, God.  Me and Anthony have a little rant about Halloween costumes.  We'll do that in a bit.  Keep the FUs coming, and we'll keep the music playing for you.  We got some Red Rider on the way and some Rush By requests.  Next.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York with the Doors, Touch Me.  That was the song you had to be listening for this hour to pick up the Aerosmith tickets.  And Rick's got a winner in the other room.  He'll be running in here any second with that. 
[00:15:30]  Next hour, you got to listen for the Rolling Stones' Hang Fire.  When you do, be the 10th caller at 212-757-1027,  and you, too, will win a pair of tickets to see Aerosmith.  Cool.  Sophie and Anthony on FU Friday.  Very, very busy day.  People are angry this week.  I'm sensing that.  I like that.  They're actually taking advantage of FU Friday.  Denise Bartolotta of Bayside.  She's got the Aerosmith tickets.  Congratulations, Denise.  Sorry about that. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, man.  It's the Aerosmith.  Yes.  Oh, I got to declare something here.  What?  I was watching the news before we got in today,  and I must say, a lot of people will be dressing up for Halloween once again this year.  Yes, yes.  If you go to a Halloween party dressed as Monica or President Clinton,  you are the biggest dork in New York.  I got to agree.  I was watching the news, and they're talking about, you know, the hottest costumes for this Halloween.  Yeah.  And, of course, dressing up like Monica and putting on, like, you know, a Clinton mask are the favorites this year. 
[00:16:30]  See, now, not only just the Clinton mask, you got to put the suit jacket on,  but then just walk around in boxer shorts with a cigar.  That's just whack, whack-zain-erific.  You show up to a party like that, come on, get a life.  How retarded.  And then, of course, a bunch of girls are going to be walking around with their little berets. 
[00:17:00]  And the blue dress.  And a blue dress with a big stain on it.  Whoa, hey, that's original.  That's great.  And it'll be even funnier.  The more a stain the girl has.  Like, if you unload a full container of Cool Whip on your body before you go to your wacky party,  that'll be hysterical.  Just whole zany.  And then at the party, they'll get the Clinton guy together with the Monica girl,  and I'll take pictures with him.  Yeah, it'll be cute.  Great.  And they'll come in, like, fifth place in the costume contest. 
[00:17:30]  Coming in fifth.  It's Bill and Monica.  Come on up here.  Give him a big hand.  Oh, look at him.  Look, she's trying to get up on stage, but Bill's sticking her with a cigar as she walks up the stairs.  That's insane, you kids.  You're wacky, zany.  Don't do it to yourself.  Don't dress as Monica or the president this Halloween season.  I don't even dress up for Halloween.  No, I don't.  I just can't do that anymore.  I go to the parties, you know. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  I can't understand the people that do this whole huge thing.  It's like, what are you?  I'm the space shuttle.  And, like, it's a huge space shuttle with his face sticking out of it.  Hey, look, and my booster rockets work.  And he's, well, we've got to walk around in a big box.  Or, hey, look, I'm a toilet.  This year, I'm the toilet.  Look, flush me.  I like the people.  They go to these big clubs and stuff, you know, pay all the money.  And then their costume is like a tree, and they stand in the corner for the whole night,  and they don't even enjoy themselves. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, you can't even move in some of these things.  Look at me.  I'm the Titanic.  Right.  Actual size.  This is great, isn't it?  Could you just pour a drink down my smokestack?  Pretty thirsty.  And, no, that isn't the bilge draining.  Out the bottom.  I'm actually taking a leak.  Can't fit in the bathroom.  I like a simple costume.  Me.  Yeah, there you go.  Just go and have fun.  There it is, a PSA from the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:19:00]  Don't do it to yourselves.  Last week's tip, we told you guys not to see Night at the Roxbury.  Yes.  Some of you did not listen, and now you're...  You sat through it.  You sat through it, hating it.  And this is our tip this week.  Do not go, as Bill and Monica, to your Halloween party this year.  Thank you.  Okay.  You know, a lot of people are requesting the Da Da Dave thing again.  Yeah.  Isn't that something?  I think we're going to add another piece of that puzzle today.  The actual bit that we did that made our boss Dave call us in the first place. 
[00:19:30]  Yes.  Why he was calling saying we should ease off on the subject we were talking about.  Yes, so that's a little tease, so stick around for that if you know what we're talking about.  Also, some Blondie on the way, and I think, oh, we're running late, actually.  We'll get some who on next.  Stay there.  Opie, Larry in Jersey emailed us saying anyone who goes as Monica to a Halloween party should  be required to give a Lewinsky to anyone they encounter dressed as Bill.  Ooh, very good. 
[00:20:00]  I think I might have to dress as Bill then.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  Lonesome George Thorogood.  One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer.  It's Opie and Anthony on FU Friday.  Keep the faxes coming.  212-957-WNEW.  Lots going on.  There's a whole pile of faxes to get to.  We'll try in a minute here, but the phone's also ringing like crazy.  Let's take one.  AnyW.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  How you doing?  Good.  Mr., can you do me a favor?  Can you play that da-da-da metal you had yesterday?  I laughed my ass off with that. 
[00:20:30]  So if you guys can play that, that will make my weekend start out really, really good.  All right, brother.  We'll play that.  Beauty, guys.  Thank you.  Be good.  Man, everybody is requesting that today.  And it would be bit of the week, but it's actually an old Opie and Anthony bit, so it's not in the running.  Yeah, this is our old boss.  Well, we got a new piece of the puzzle today.  I have found the bit he was complaining about.  Oh, brother.  So, well, if you remember that Volkswagen commercial with the two guys driving around in the Volkswagen to the da-da-da song, 
[00:21:00]  and they find the little chair, and they put it in the back of the car,  and then they, I guess the chair stinks or something.  Yeah, they get rid of the chair eventually.  They get rid of it.  Everyone's seen it.  And in between, you know, they're playing with little toys in the front seat and making little, like, judo moves at each other and stuff.  And I was just saying on the air that I thought it was a gay commercial.  Yes.  Not that it was a bad commercial or anything like that, but that the two guys, I had them pegged as a gay couple. 
[00:21:30]  As a gay couple.  Right.  Others think it's actually a couple college guys, but...  I said no.  No way, because, I mean, the point I want to make, if I'm driving with you, and I make cute little karate moves to you, what are you going to do?  I'm probably going to smack you upside your head.  And if I play with little squishy toys, what would you think?  It's just something that, you know, I think most straight guys wouldn't do to their pal while they're driving around the city.  All right.  Our own opinion.  So, me and Anthony decided to play the song that's in that commercial, Da Da. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, and see what comes out.  By Trio, right?  Yeah.  And, yeah, this was one take.  It's pretty obvious, but that's okay.  So, listen to the song.  We remade it.  And then, right after that, our boss called to complain about this bit.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  I'll just play in your face with this fucking toy as we drive. 
[00:22:30]  Isn't it, too?  Uh-huh.  This will be very hard to tell that we're gay.  What you doing, what you don't.  Look, I'm doing karate moves at you.  Look.  What you doing, what you won't.  What?  What got beautifully lost.  Hey, there's a chair.  That'll look great in our apartment.  We live together.  But let's not say we're gay, so anyone watching the commercial really has to think that we are.  Oh, look at that chair.  Oh, I can sit in it and you can sit in my lap.  Licky, licky, licky, d***. 
[00:23:00]  Licky, licky, licky, b***.

[00:23:30]  Turn on it, turn on to a game!  Perfect new game!  Woohoo! 
[00:24:00]  All right, albeit annoying as hell, the boss got a little upset about the content.  Yes.  Thought it was a little...  A little too much.  As he said, entering the gay zone.  Yeah, so we taped our old boss and we messed with him a little bit. Check it out.  Hello!  Hello.  What's up?  I just wanted to...  Why are you on this line?  Well, I figured it was easier than getting out of my chair and coming down the hall. 
[00:24:30]  Oh.  Just wanted to make a request.  Yeah.  Maybe we could steer the show in a little different direction so that this doesn't get out of hand.  What's getting out of hand?  Well, I think we're going into the gay zone and we all know where that leads.  Wouldn't you agree?  Not really, but...  Pokey pokey in the butt.  No, no.  Licky licky.  That's fun stuff.  Yeah, it's fun, but you know what? 
[00:25:00]  It's going to get us in trouble.  Just, you know, steer somewhere else.  If you keep going this direction, it's going to be trouble.  I'm just warning you.  Not from me.  I'm talking about outside.  We've been down this road before.  The old dirt road.  Yeah.  Just giving you a little heads up here.  All right.  Okay.  Head.  See ya.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Hello?

Kenny Wayne Shepard.  Somehow, somewhere, someway for your ride home today.  It's Opie and Anthony.  F you Friday in progress.  Oh, this is lovely.  Deborah Marshall from Jersey. 
[00:26:30]  Anthony, are you the same guy who went on Howard Stern's morning show a couple of years ago to do your Jackie impression?  What's with that?  How can you be successful now?  You were such a broken down suitcase then.  You hated life back then.  Oh, man.  See, fairy tales can come true.  It can happen to you.  Yes, you were installing air conditioners at that point.  Yeah, I was in air conditioning and heating tech.  Yeah.  And now you're doing radio.  Go figure how that works.  I have no idea how that happened. 
[00:27:00]  I was a radio guy trapped in the body of an air conditioning technician.  Yeah.  Oh, and now the WNEW Weekend Weather Check sponsored by Starship Troopers Home Video.  Do I have to go to the window?  The forecast is, yeah, the sales staff doesn't understand we don't do weather on our show, and they give us these stupid things to read.  All right, hold on.  All right, I want you to let everyone know what the weather's all about.  Wait a minute.  All right.  Gosh.  All right.  Yeah.  It looks like drizzle. 
[00:27:30]  Okay.  And it doesn't look like there's any sign of it clearing up.  All right.  I see some trees on top of that building.  What's with that trees on top of building?  What is it, an illusion?  You think you're in a forest?  All right, Seinfeld.  Continue.  Who are these people that put trees on buildings?  You never see a building on a tree.  It's kind of windy.  Kind of windy.  Kind of windy.  All right, there's your weather. 
[00:28:00]  This weekend by Starship Troopers, the eye-popping sci-fi thriller, now on video cassette and DVD from Columbia TriStar.  Can you tell we don't give a nap?  And can you feel the love here?  Hey, we got Bit of the Week on the way.  All right.  I think it's very obvious what Bit of the Week was.  Well, we did get a phone call, didn't we?  Yeah.  We'll play that hopefully before 6 o'clock.  We're running a little late here.  And I think today's a special day.  A little wet and slick on the roadways.  Everyone is slowing down.  I don't understand that concept, but people like to drive even slower when there's a little drizzle in the air. 
[00:28:30]  A few dots of water hit their windshield, and they just jam on the brakes.  Hey, don't forget, you're listening for Hang Fire by the Rolling Stones for the Aerosmith tickets.  When you hear that song, be the 10th caller at 212-757-1027, and you will score the tickets.  In the meantime, it's the Ramones on the Rock of New York.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York, whole celebrity skin.  It's Opie and Anthony on FU Friday.  The fax is still spilling in here if you want to add one to the list. 
[00:29:00]  212-957-WNEW.  This guy writes, thanks for Heston traffic.  It's a madhouse!  Damn!  He writes in parentheses.  Now, how about Homo Mondays?  Out your boss, friends, enemies.  I see lawsuits.  No guts, no glory.  FU Friday rules, by the way.  And this one's good.  It's raining.  My girl dumped me.  I lost my job.  And I'm going for the pipe next week.  No!  F everyone. 
[00:29:30]  And I think his name's Lucky.  I don't know.  Lucky.  He's calling himself Lucky today, anyway.  That's zany.  I think in the last hour of the show, we'll definitely get to a lot of FUs.  So you can use the fax line, 212-957-WNEW.  Or if you're home already and not stuck in traffic like half the people listening to us right now.  At your computer, WNEW.com.  Click on our pictures and instantly email us, please.  All right.  I do believe, Anthony, it is time for Bit of the Week.  Oh, we all know what this is going to be.  Yes, let's cue Spacey Kasem here. 
[00:30:00]  Welcome back.  It's time now for Opie and Anthony's Bit of the Week.  Hi, I'm Spacey Kasem.  And that old hosebag life of mine can deep throat a bridge piling.  Here now is what happens when a clueless buffoon calls the wrong number.  And instead of getting the party to whom he wished to speak, he gets two unsympathetic asswipes, Opie and Anthony.  Laugh along with Red's voicemail.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yes, Red Brown there, please. 
[00:30:30]  Who is this?  My name is Terry.  What is the name of this company?  Well, I want to know why you're calling me, Terry.  I don't know.  This is a number I had for Mr. Red Brown, who's in video.  Yeah, let me check the name of the company, sir.  Panasonic.  Panasonic, yes.  Who are you trying to get a hold of, sir?  I'm trying to get a hold of Red Brown.  Oh, okay.  He's in video production.  Yeah.  Okay, hold on.  Video.  Yeah, is Red there, please?  Oh, Red?  Yeah.  Yeah, um, geez, he just stepped out.  Hold on two seconds. 
[00:31:00]  Thank you.  Uh, yeah, cafeteria.  Yeah, Red?  Uh, no, Red is down the hall.  All right.  Who's this?  This is Terry from Panasonic calling.  Okay, hold on, Terry.  Personnel.  I'm trying to reach Red Brown, please.  Red Brown?  Yes, sir.  Okay, this is personnel.  Okay, I guess I've been transferred all over the place.  Oh, I'm sorry.  That's all right.  Actually, he's probably in video production.  Yeah, that's it.  Okay, hold on, please.  Thank you.  Master Control. 
[00:31:30]  I'm looking for Red Brown still.  Uh, yes.  Red's a little busy right now.  Okay, just check if I can leave a message, please.  Okay, what's the message?  The message is, return my call, please.  This is Terry at Panasonic.  Hold on, let me tell him.  He's under the desk.  Red, Terry's on the phone.  Carlos from Panasonic?  Yeah.  Tell him I can't talk right now.  My mouth is full.  Okay.  He's a little busy right now.  I heard all that. 
[00:32:00]  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Let me transfer you back to his office.  Thank you.  Red's office?  Yes, I'd like to leave a message for Red, please.  Oh, okay.  Uh, he might want his voicemail then, right?  That's fine.  Okay, hold on.  All right, you've reached Red's voicemail.  Please leave a message after the Tom.  Hello, this is Terry at Panasonic 201.  All right, this is Red's voicemail.  Please leave a message after the Tom.  Oh, yeah, Red, this is Terry at Panasonic 201-392. 
[00:32:30]  I'm sorry.  We are not receiving your message.  Please speak in a clear voice.  Hi, this is Red's voicemail.  Please leave a message after the Tom.  Terry from Panasonic calling 201-392-6141.  Hi, this is Red's voicemail.  Please leave a message after the Tom.  Very cool.  Looks like a lot of people liked Bit of the Week.  Thank you very much. 
[00:33:00]  We appreciate that, right?  Right in.  Mm-hmm.  What are you doing over there?  I'm reading instant feedback, Opie.  Oh, that's what I do.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York.  Kiss.  Kiss.  I can't hear you.  Come on.  That's a great Friday song, isn't it?  Yeah.  Got to congratulate Linda Summer of Hoboken.  She won the Aerosmith tickets last hour.  Congratulations, Linda.  This hour, you've got to be listening for ZZ Topps, Give Me All Your Love. 
[00:33:30]  And when you hear that song, be the 10th caller at 212-757-1027.  And you'll score tickets to the big show at Jones Beach next week.  Okay?  All right.  FU Friday's going quite well.  And what do you got over there in instant feedback?  Well, first, Bob in New Jersey.  We nearly killed him from what I'm gathering here.  We can't kill any of our faithful listeners.  We need every single one of you guys at this point.  Yeah.  You guys nearly killed me.  Your Dirty Columbo sketch came on when I was driving on a busy road. 
[00:34:00]  I laughed so hard.  I had trouble holding on to the wheel and my eyes watered up.  What would I tell the cops if I thrash?  Funny sketch, though.  Thank you.  You know what?  You think we could end the show with Dirty Columbo?  Or have we played it too much in the last couple of days?  Yeah, we could probably end it because we'll never, ever play it again.  Yeah, that's true.  Well, we did it because of the Columbo movie last night.  So until he makes another one, we'll have to rest that one.  Yes.  So we'll end the show with that.  All right.  That'll be a good way to end it.  At 7 o'clock. 
[00:34:30]  Also, the FU's still coming in.  You got a good one you're saying over there?  Oh, my God.  This one is awful.  This has to be the worst one.  I can't use her name.  Okay.  It says, please don't use my name.  I don't want to give too much ammo for the divorce lawyer he will hire.  Uh-oh.  A big FU to my husband who's too lame to accompany me to a formal party.  So FU, I got a date.  And FU because I F'd my date last night while you were out drinking with your friends. 
[00:35:00]  In fact, when you came home and crawled into bed and asked me about the wet spot and I told you that it was a drink I spilled.  Well, it wasn't.  In fact, I have F'd my date more times this past week than we had F'd in the past six months.  So F you because tonight I'm too tired.  Come on.  He sat in the wet spot in his own bed with his wife. 
[00:35:30]  Oh.  Wait a minute.  Now that could be the...  A guy's love porridge and he sits in it while he gets into his own bed.  Oh, does it get worse than that?  I don't think so.  That might be the F you of the day.  Hey, honey, boy, I'm tired.  What's this?  Oh, no, I was...  I was drinking iced tea before I went to bed.  That was a pina colada. 
[00:36:00]  So is that the F you of the day?  Because I saved this one from earlier.  It doesn't taste like pina colada.  What do you got?  That's brutal.  Well, this might have to be the runner-up because I thought this was going to be the one.  Hi, guys.  Thank God it's Friday.  I've been waiting for this all week.  I would like to give a big F you to Richie Tannis of Queens.  I feel so sorry for your girlfriend because she has no idea what an a-hole you are. 
[00:36:30]  P.S.  If she is listening or anyone who knows her, I have been sleeping with him since I met him at Club Getaway.  Oh, God.  People are just having sex all over.  You guys are vicious today.  I love it.  This has been an exceptionally brutal F you Friday.  I love it.  Yes.  Definitely.  Well, that's why it's here.  We can't sugarcoat this.  Everyone gets really ticked off during the week.  And we give you a chance to vent on our lovely show on Friday.  That's it.  All right.  Enough of that.  We've got to play some rock and roll here. 
[00:37:00]  Let's see here.  Well, what do you got?  Well, Anthony, I got some police.  And I got some Sean Mullins if people stick around.  Hi, N.E.W.  Oh, man, I got to tell you, that F you for the girl whose husband sat in the wet spot definitely has to be the winner.  That is the worst thing that could possibly happen.  Oh, man.  This guy has got to be the biggest fool.  Insult to injury there, man.  Oh, yeah.  That has to be the winner, man. 
[00:37:30]  And I'd like to get that.  His own dad, his own wife.  His own dad, his own wife.  He's sitting in somebody else's jolly juice.  I'm telling you, I was laughing so hard, man.  That was definitely the funniest.  Thank God it's fighting.  All right, man.  Have a great weekend.  All right.  You too, man.  Here's Sean Mullins and Lullaby on the Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York with the police so lonely. 
[00:38:00]  I think we've got to send that song out to the wife from the instant email that you read about 15 minutes ago.  The wife?  I don't think she's lonely at all.  No, not at all.  The husband, maybe.  Maybe the husband.  This is horrible.  We're getting such a reaction on this, too.  It is F you Friday, and this woman sent an F you but said, please don't use her name.  She doesn't want to give ammo for the divorce lawyer.  A big F you to my husband who's too lame to accompany me to a formal party.  So F you, I got a date, and F you because I F'd my date last night while you were out drinking with your friends. 
[00:38:30]  In fact, when you came home and crawled into bed and asked me about the wet spot, and I told you that it was the drink I spilled, well, it wasn't.  In fact, I have F'd my date more times this past week than we have F'd in the past six months.  So F you because tonight I'm too tired.  The guy crawls into bed.  Into his own bed.  Into his bed with his wife who just had sex with a guy and lays in the pleasure porridge of this individual. 
[00:39:00]  The ultimate in degradation, I would say.  Well, people are freaking out.  This fax came in.  What a bitch.  Way to go, honey.  And there's a picture of a penis colada because you mentioned that earlier.  Probably what she said she spelt.  Right.  The penis colada.  And it has the Coco Lopez pina colada mix next to the drink with a spizoo hanging out of the glass. 
[00:39:30]  I like this one.  John from Jersey's got it.  If there was ever a case for justifiable homicide, it would be if that dude smelled the wet spot and cut his wife into 35 small pieces.  And then get this little Chris Rock mention.  He goes, I'm not saying he should kill her, but I'd sure understand.  Oh, my God.  That hits way below the belt for a guy.  The whole image that you crawl into bed every night with your wife, and you just slip into a wet spot like that. 
[00:40:00]  From somebody else.  Some other guy's juice.  All right.  Great.  Well, you're not getting off the hook.  Everyone is calling.  They're emailing.  They're faxing.  They want to hear one last pork guy.  They want to hear pork guy.  They want to hear pork guy.  Well, can we get pork guy out on the street with his bicycle?  Well, actually, I do believe I got some actual audio from pork guy. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  We're seeing how many different types of pork he can wheel off as he weaves in and out of traffic.  Yes.  We've all seen the guys on their bikes with their little delivery baskets delivering Chinese food.  Right.  All right.  I think this is the audio right here.  Oh, pork fry rice.  Roast pork embroidery.  Shryse pork.  Hunan pork.  Double-cut pork.  Out the way.  Pork with garlic sauce.  Pork and Peking sauce.  Pork and hot pepper sauce. 
[00:41:00]  Mushu pork.  Pork and scallion.  Sweet as hard.  Pork roast pork.  Pork Chinese vegetable.  Pork chum.  Pork.  Pork.  Pork.  Pork.  Pork tomato.  Pork oyster sauce.  Oh, pork guy.  Double-sauté.  Slice pork.  Shredded pork.  Pork Peking.  String bean pork.  Roast pork.  Egg full young.  Out the way.  Oh, the pork guy took a hit. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, call an ambulance.  Did you see that?  Yeah, I saw that.  1027-WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  Bare Naked Ladies.  One week.  ZZ Top.  Before that, Give Me All Your Love.  And that was the song you had to be listening for for the Aerosmith tickets this hour.  And, Rick, who's our winner this hour?  That would be Amanda Chessa of, where is she from?  Yorktown Heights, New York.  Hey, congratulations, Amanda.  All right.  She's got tickets for the Jones Beat Show next week. 
[00:42:00]  Matt, you got more Aerosmith tickets?  Yes.  What songs do they have to be listening for?  Stone.  Stone?  Get Off My Cloud.  Get Off My Cloud.  When you hear Matt play that in the 7 o'clock hour, be the 10th caller.  Caller 212-757-1027, and you, too, will score tickets to see Aerosmith.  Hey, hey, you, you.  I guess we've got to get out of here.  Do we?  A couple people called and said, we're stuck in traffic today.  Could you guys do another hour?  Excuse me.  We're going to be in that same jam as you. 
[00:42:30]  We'll be right behind you guys.  We'll be an hour behind you guys.  So don't worry about it.  Yeah.  Anything on the instant feedback before we head out of here?  Ralph from Jersey said, thank you.  For, uh, pork.  Oh, for the pork guy?  I was a crying roughing so hard at a pork.  Pork.  Chang, fang.  Wah.  Pork.  Very good.  Yo, where we come?  All right.  Uh, we didn't get to Stockbroker Dave today.  I, I hope if he's listening, he's not mad at us.  No, we had a busy day. 
[00:43:00]  There were FUs, uh, all over.  Yeah.  So I guess the last FU is Stockbroker Dave telling us, FU.  I think it, it is.  Actually, we'll have his report Monday.  He's got some interesting things to say about the market.  And the world economy, Anthony.  Yes.  My God, on our show, we're actually going to talk about the world economy.  We're up to date with things.  We're trying.  We are trying.  We did promise we'd play, uh, Dirty Columbo one last time.  One last time.  We watched them last night on TV, aging badly.  Yeah.  And we'll put this in the Opie and Anthony archives.  So this will be the last time you hear this for a while. 
[00:43:30]  Mm-hmm.  All right.  So sit back and enjoy.  All right.  So sit back and enjoy.  All right.  So sit back and enjoy.  All right.  All right.  So sit back and enjoy.  All right.  So sit back and enjoy.  All right.  So sit back and enjoy.  All right.  So sit back and enjoy. </pre>
