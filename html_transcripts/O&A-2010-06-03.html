<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a furious discussion about Armando Galarraga's near-perfect game, ruined by umpire Jim Joyce's egregious missed call.  The hosts and callers unleashed a torrent of profanity, dissecting the play frame-by-frame and debating the possibility – and desirability – of MLB overturning the call or implementing replay review.  This segued into Anthony's recent purchase of a Barrett M107 .50 caliber sniper rifle, prompting a detailed discussion of its power, legality, and cost, peppered with caller anecdotes.  Travis likely contributed to this segment.

Next, the show tackled the BP oil spill, met with sarcastic and crude suggestions for solutions from the hosts, including a Bruce Willis-led intervention, and mockery of President Obama's response. This transitioned into a harsh, profanity-laced critique of Gary Coleman's wife, Shannon Price, based on her 911 call following Coleman's head injury. The call was played in segments, highlighting what the hosts considered Price's lack of concern.  They repeatedly referred to her with highly offensive terms like "worthless" and "a cunt." The segment also included a scathing review of a new Paul McCartney song, promotion of Jim Norton's upcoming shows at Caroline's Comedy Club (with a phone number for ticket giveaways), and a bizarre "Kenny"-led Dickie Goodman-style parody interview of Lady Gaga, described as both "incredible" and "awful".

The following segment began with Opie discussing his personal trainer.  The conversation quickly shifted back to Gary Coleman's death, with callers speculating about foul play by his wife.  This led to discussions of other crimes, including a gruesome murder by an MMA fighter and Joran van der Sloot's involvement in the Natalee Holloway case and a subsequent murder in Peru.  The hosts expressed disgust and outrage at van der Sloot's actions.  A significant portion focused on John Mark Carr, who falsely confessed to the JonBenét Ramsey murder and was allegedly attempting to start a child sex cult; listeners called in with further details, including the alleged involvement of Carr's ex-wife. The hosts expressed extreme anger and revulsion at Carr's actions.  The show then veered into a highly critical discussion of child beauty pageants like "Little Miss Perfect" and "Toddlers & Tiaras," using offensive language to describe both the children and their parents.  A caller provided further details.  This segment also included a call from Justin van der Sloot (Joran's brother), a discussion with Chris "Mad Dog" Russo about the controversial baseball call (mentioned previously), and Opie discussing his acid reflux.

A later segment revisited the contentious baseball call, featuring an extensive debate about Commissioner Selig's potential intervention and the feasibility of implementing replay review, criticizing the players' union's inaction.  Mad Dog Russo appeared as a guest, offering his perspective on the baseball controversy and other sports news, including the NBA Finals. The conversation branched out to include negative airline experiences (particularly with Continental Airlines), alleged subliminal advertising (mentioning ice cubes in alcohol commercials, Betty Boop, and the Little Mermaid), and a lengthy discussion of Dickie Goodman's novelty recordings and his eventual suicide, playing several of his recordings (including parodies of *Jaws*, *King Kong*, *Star Wars*, and *Watergate*), and a listener-submitted parody of Goodman interviewing Andrea Yates.

The final segment featured Opie, Anthony, Vinny, and a studio guest, Jimmy (a comedian). The discussion started with a "brutal" joke, shifting to child-rearing,  Vinny's sleep deprivation, and the comedic success of Charlie Murphy and Craig Robinson. The conversation became highly offensive, with extreme and inflammatory statements regarding parenting styles (including references to Hitler and the Holocaust), criticism of Vinny's daughter's choice to volunteer on an organic farm after expensive college,  and discussion of Vinny's son's unconventional lifestyle.  Louie C.K.’s parenting advice (including the use of a highly offensive term for his daughter) was mentioned.  The show returned to firearms, focusing again on Anthony's .50 caliber rifle, before moving to Jimmy's upcoming shows and Otto's performance at the Stress Factory, including humorous anecdotes about comedy clubs and Dave Attell (including a story about someone grabbing Attell's testicles).  The segment ended with the recurring bit "Jimspirations" and promotional information.

[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you.  Our show is stupid.  This is so irresponsible.  This should be illegal.  It really should be.  It's like, it's so unethical.  God, I hate fucking radio.  This could be the worst audio ever.  Shut up.  Shut your fucking mouth.  This is terrible.  We just suck all around.  I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend.  I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend. 
[00:04:00]  This stinks.  Fucking shut the fuck up.  We get it.  We get it.  We get it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Jim Joyce is a kid.  Jim Joyce is a kid.  Jim Joyce is a kid.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Poor Galarag.  Galarag.  Man, the whole fucking country is talking about this perfect game, huh?  Well, it's not a perfect game.  Oh, it's not a perfect game.  I thought he was out.  You know, looking at the tape. 
[00:04:30]  I thought he was out, too.  There's a lot of outrage in Major League Baseball.  Outrage?  You know, I saw this last night on the replay.  I didn't know it was.  I thought it was just a bad call.  I didn't know that it was through a perfect game.  You didn't know this was for the perfect game?  Last out of the game.  And he had him.  He knew he was out, too.  Oh, no.  Even the pitcher knew.  The batter knew he was out.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at the batter.  Like, you can't do that.  It's like, oh, no.  You can't take a perfect game away from this guy.  Two outs in the ninth. 
[00:05:00]  It was over.  They were ready to just jump on this kid and pat him on the back.  Jim Leland should have just fucking taken Jim Joyce out.  Just taken him out MMA style.  Just look out and pop him in the face.  Oh, yeah.  I think the whole country would have understood.  I think Bud Zilink.  Bud Zilink.  Zilink?  Bud would have understood.  Look at that.  He got him.  By almost a full stride.  Yeah.  What was this guy looking at?  That's a bad one.  Nice play, too, by the second baseman. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, they bailed him out a few times during the night.  Look at that.  Look at that.  I mean, how do you fuck that call up?  Wow.  And even the umpire said after the game he blew it, right?  Yeah, he said.  Because a few people on Twitter are like, you know, the ball was being bobbled in the mint.  It's like, shut up.  The ump even said that he blew it.  He blew it.  It was obvious.  He blew it.  He was in tears.  He hugged the pitcher.  Yeah.  I just, my dream was to be a major league umpire. 
[00:06:00]  I had two bad eyes.  What were the announcers saying while this was happening?  Were they saying how horrible?  Holy motherfucker.  Oh.  And there's a strike called.  One and two.  This is how it went down, right?  No, can we go back then?  Just stumbling.  What happened?  No, I wanted to hear the, uh, that was after the, uh.  Oh, that was after?  This is the call, actually.  So, technically, this is a one-hitter right now? 
[00:06:30]  No, no, no.  Dan just went back.  It's a no-hitter.  Yeah.  Perfect game.  Perfect game.  Yeah, this was for the perfect game.  This is how it went down last night.  Ground ball.  Right side.  Cabrera will cut it off.  Galaragia covers.  He's out.  Oh, he's safe.  He is safe.  He is safe at first base.  Oh, Jesus.  And here comes Jim Leland. 
[00:07:00]  Ooh.  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah, Leland's way too calm.  He does the typical yelling in his face thing, but.  Yeah, should have spun his hat around.  Oh, yeah.  That hat should have been spun around.  He was safe at first base.  You make the call.  You make the call.  Now they're going to see it.  Galaragia.  It's not even close.  He's out.  Oh.  Why is he safe?  Why is he safe? 
[00:07:30]  What?  Are you kidding me?  Why is he safe?  You see right here.  They're losing.  Why is he safe?  The guy can't believe it.  Oh, my goodness.  Jim Joyce.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Oh, my goodness.  What a travesty.  What an absolute travesty.  Oh, they booing this guy.  Oh, my goodness, Armando.  I'm sorry for you, big fella. 
[00:08:00]  I am really sorry.  Big fella.  That is terrible.  How can baseball, I know they have ruled, but how can they not override that?  Everyone in baseball saw this guy get robbed.  Are the players really?  Oh, God.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Holy Jesus.  Travis was explaining a few things this morning to me and Aunt Travis.  There's a couple things that could happen technically, right?  T-Dog?  No, it's Trab Dog, if you want to.  I want to shorten it. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, okay.  The Tigers' official scorer at the stadium, he said that he could look at the replay again,  and if Galarraga did, in fact, bobble the ball, like some people say he did, he could  take the hit away and make it an error and give him a no-hitter.  That's as far as the Tigers' official scorer can go.  Right.  To overrule the play completely and give him a perfect game, Bud C-League has to step in  and make a special. 
[00:09:00]  Can he do it?  Yeah.  He's the commissioner of baseball.  Sure he can.  But the whole country talking about this today, he just should do it.  I think he will.  I really think he will.  We got proof that this kid pitched a perfect game.  Yeah.  TV proves that he pitched a perfect game.  It's not going to be someone else's word that was on the field as well.  I bet you the umpire wants him to do it, too.  I bet you the umpire wants that fixed.  Even with the umpire saying, I blew it.  I made the wrong call.  I cost this kid a perfect game.  Yeah.  That should be enough for them to just, you know what? 
[00:09:30]  And it doesn't affect the outcome of the game or any of that crap.  Just give the guy the perfect game.  I agree.  Two outs in the ninth.  It was over.  Yeah.  It was over.  And then, oh, to just have it snatched away like that.  And Miguel Cabrera, the first baseman, he continued to argue with the umpire even after it was over.  When they were still, when he was getting the 28th out of his perfect game, he's still yelling at the umpire from first base.  It was unbelievable.  I couldn't believe what I was watching.  Amazing.  This is what the ump had to say after the game, I believe. 
[00:10:00]  No, I did not get the call correct.  I kicked the s**t out of it.  Did you feel like you had a clear angle on it?  No, I did.  I had a great angle on it.  I had a great positioning on it.  I just missed the damn call.  I missed it.  I missed it from here to the wall.  Did you, when you and me were talking after the game, did you tell him? 
[00:10:30]  I got to stop.  Was that Pharrell?  What?  Was that Pharrell asking?  You missed the call.  What did you do?  What happened?  You missed the call.  You missed the call.  You missed the call.  Shut up.  When it's for a perfect game, shouldn't the ump kind of give the benefit of the doubt  to the pitcher?  You know what I mean?  Is it one of the...  Because it wasn't even close.  So why would you in your head think, you know, this is safe? 
[00:11:00]  You know what I mean?  It's for a perfect game.  All he's saying is, I blew the call, but he's not really telling us how he blew the call.  Like, what was he thinking?  Did he think that he bobbled the ball in his hand, didn't have control of it?  Did he think that he just beat him to the fucking bag?  What's his fucking excuse?  Let's find out.  There's more audio here.  When we were talking after the game, did you tell him the same?  Pardon me?  When you and Jim were talking after the game, did you tell him you missed the call? 
[00:11:30]  No, I did not tell him I missed the call, because at that particular time, I really thought  I got the call right.  I really thought I got the call right.  Did you think...  I thought he beat the play.  Wow.  I thought he beat him to the bag, and I thought he beat it.  At that particular time, I thought he beat the play, and now that I'm standing here and  I've seen it on the replay, and naturally, every tiger out there was telling me that I 
[00:12:00]  had kicked the call because they'd seen the replay, so the first thing I did when I got  in this locker room was looked at...  I told the Tim, our clubhouse guy, to cue it up, and...  I missed it.  I missed it.  Wow.  Obviously, you're never happy when you miss a call.  This isn't a call.  This isn't...  This is...  This is a history call.  And I kicked the s*** out of it. 
[00:12:30]  He's upset.  And there's nobody that feels worse than I do.  This guy might kill himself.  Thank you, umpire Patterson.  Umpire Dwyer, please relax.  Pulls a gun out of a catcher's mitt.  Oh, my God.  Why aren't you stumping the umpire's guts out?  Hi, Galarag.  Did you call out at first base? 
[00:13:00]  A blunt call is allowed in a perfect game.  Get the hell out of my ball field.  Get the hell out of my ball field.  Get the hell out of my ball field.  What the f*** is this?  To Rosenberg.  Your butt ceiling has to step in and do it.  Because it's not...  If there was one out in the ninth, and then the next guy struck out, you could say anything  could have happened.  Who knows?  This was the last play of the game.  There's absolutely no arguable way.  And they got a perfect, perfect look at the call through TV. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, amazing.  Yeah.  Just get the replay going in Major League Baseball.  What are you waiting for?  It's not the 70s or the 80s when the coverage was still a little shaky, but this HD and  this digital and all that crap.  I'll forget about it.  Yeah, you'd have just seen a shmear years ago.  Absolutely, you would have.  A blurry smear.  And they'll go, well, we can't really tell.  Now, yeah.  Well...  You get high-definition freeze frame where you can just see that he completely beat him. 
[00:14:00]  Let's go to Eddie in St. Louis.  Eddie!  Guys, I just want to say one thing.  If you love and respect the game of baseball like I do, then you need to get on the phone,  you need to write a letter to that fucking used car salesman, Bud Selig, and demand that  he give Galarraga the perfect game.  This is a travesty.  Another crime in Chicago.  Well, it's a travesty because, what, 20 perfect games in Major League Baseball history, right?  This would have been 21.  This is the eighth time in the last 40 years that a perfecto has been broken up with two  outs in the ninth, but it's never in history been fucked up by an umpire's call. 
[00:14:30]  It shouldn't be.  It really shouldn't.  Again, this is not a balls and strikes call.  Yeah.  No.  Anyone can clearly see what it was.  Once again, it's very obvious that the ball wasn't bobbled.  Very obvious that, you know, the guy was out.  The umpire is now saying, I blew the fucking call.  So you got to do it.  You just got to do it.  Yeah.  Oof.  Wow.  Fuck.  You know, it's like I always say, the more of your own light that you give away, the more  of your own darkness that you get rid of with it. 
[00:15:00]  I like that one.  That's good.  Eddie, anything else?  Holy shit.  Uh, I just want to say, I hope the Lakers beat the shit out of the Celtics, and I hope  the Blackhawks lose.  Well, you know what?  Fuck you, Eddie.  Celtics over the Lakers.  Let's go.  Are you a Celtics fan, Opie?  Well, I mean, we spent a little time in Boston, so I'll take a little peek.  You know.  I'm not a big NBA fan these days, but yeah, fucking Celtics over the Lakers. 
[00:15:30]  Absolutely.  Well, let me just say-  What has LA ever done for the Opie and Anthony show?  Nothing.  After I say fuck Bud Selig again, I just want to say I think it's great for the sport of basketball  to have both teams in the final, no matter who wins.  Oh, of course.  I think a lot of people are going to be watching that usually wouldn't.  So, all right, Eddie.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, gentlemen.  A lot of people want in on this.  Andy in Philly.  Andy.  Andy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're on, though.  Yeah, hey, it's Andy in Detroit.  Oh, okay.  Wherever.  All right.  So, that fucking Golt that made that call last night is supposed to be the home base umpire 
[00:16:00]  tonight.  Yeah.  Can you imagine?  You think they're going to give him the night off?  Yeah.  They're not going to have him as the home plate umpire tonight.  I think they'll give him the night off.  There's not a chance.  Unless Bud Selig changes it.  Unless Bud Selig.  Even if they did, I don't think they would have him there.  You know the razzing?  Every pitch is going to be a boo!  No, it wasn't!  Pitch.  That wasn't a strike.  I think they have a tough time starting the game.  I think people will start throwing a bunch of stuff onto the field.  Do you know, people say being blown calls are part of the game, but with technology, 
[00:16:30]  it doesn't have to be.  It's like, you want your team to win, and if the team wins, and it's taken away by an  umpire, it's fucking stupid.  Yeah, by a bad call?  If Jim Joyce was arrogant and said, no, man, I made the right call, then it would be tough.  You know what I mean?  But if you have the ump...  Then you'd hate him.  If you have...  Yeah, exactly.  Tom will go fuck himself and his perfect game.  Exactly.  Right.  But if you have the ump even saying, I blew it, then, you know.  Yeah, you gotta say, I mean, Detroit fans are passionate.  They might be idiots, but they're passionate.  And I think that guy's just lucky he got out of town with his life. 
[00:17:00]  I'm amazed at the, really, the restraint of the fans.  Like, I thought there was going to be a lot more shit, maybe, thrown onto the field, and  people just going bullshit.  Imagine if that happened in Philly.  Oh, forget it.  Those animal fans.  Well, there's a lot of cities.  New York, forget it.  Yeah, New York is another one that would have just been...  I mean, Philly's the ugly, ugly scene.  New York, it would have been ugly.  Boston, it would have definitely been ugly.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Oh, forget about it.  Those drunken animals. 
[00:17:30]  Even if he gave it so many people, the guy would be ugly.  No, what they do, it's ugly.  Exactly.  All right, fellas, thanks.  Practice makes perfect, but no one's perfect, so I practice, right?  Exactly, Chip.  Oh, no, you're going to combine the two?  What's that?  Are you going to combine the two?  Oh, no.  Okay, good.  They're separate entities.  All right, good.  Because I like the gymspirations.  Joe in Schenectady.  Hello, Joe.  Hi.  The commissioner could invoke the best interest of baseball clause and overturn it, which 
[00:18:00]  it's a no-brainer.  It is in the best interest of baseball.  This is history.  Best interest of baseball clause?  Is there a best interest in baseball clause?  I didn't know that.  That's amazing.  Bowie Kuhn invoked it when the A's were trying to trade away all their star players.  They traded, like, Reggie Jackson, a pitcher, and by the blue, and to the Giants, I think 
[00:18:30]  it was, and he voided it because he didn't feel it was in the best interest of baseball.  So it does exist.  And, you know, this is something only 20 other people have done in the history of the  game, and this is huge.  Well, let me ask you, what happens, though?  What does the players' union do about this?  Like, this, to me, is where the players' union should step in and go, we understand the way  things are, but everyone in the country saw what happened.  And you can't have history changed when everybody saw it was a bad call. 
[00:19:00]  The players' union is more concerned with covering up who's on steroids and who's not.  Right.  Let's see what they do.  Maybe they'll pipe up about this.  Let's wake Mad Dog up.  What has he got on this?  Really?  What does the Mad Dog have on this?  Oh, is he going to just go off?  I bet you.  I would assume Steve is trying to get him on the show, considering this is a huge sports  moment.  Janine's very clever.  She goes, with that horrible call, I imagine the ump was an O&A listener. 
[00:19:30]  That's very funny.  Because you people have shitty calls.  Yes.  Get it?  I thought it was because they got to a first play or something.  That too, Chip.  That too.  I think Chip is witty.  No.  Someone is asking why another umpire on the field couldn't override that.  Travis, you know anything on that?  Was he the umpire crew chief?  He might have been.  The home plate umpire isn't necessarily the crew chief. 
[00:20:00]  I'm not sure who the crew chief for that night was.  But it's usually the person who has the best view of the play.  And where he was standing, he had the best view of the play.  So, pfft.  Yeah.  How'd he miss that one?  I wasn't even looking at it then.  I mean, how'd he miss that?  Wow.  I bet he was judging it harsher because he didn't want to give a perfect game where he  shouldn't have.  You know what I mean?  That's probably what it was.  He seemed very emphatic in his safe call.  They always are. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, how about, and it was instantaneous.  It was one of those quick calls.  He should have done one of those fucking Leslie Nielsen naked gun calls.  Remember that one where it's like, everyone's waiting, and he goes, sir?  Oh.  Sir!  You know, one of those.  And then he has the confidence on his stuff.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Fuck it.  Leslie Nielsen rocks.  Take a couple of seconds there to maybe let your brain process what you just fucking 
[00:21:00]  saw.  Let's go to Chris on Long Island.  Chris.  Opie, Jimmy, Faggot, what's going on?  Hi.  Oh, hi.  What's up, Chris?  Listen, 30-something years ago, Greg Brady at a high school football game turned around  because it's fantastic photography.  Now, Ant, do you know anything about this?  Yes.  Because you know a lot about the Brady Bunch.  Yes, yes.  I do recall.  Greg was taking pictures of the game, wasn't he?  Because he was... 
[00:21:30]  He was taking pictures of a girl.  Remember his key leader girlfriend?  And he just by chance caught that one play where the kid's foot was out of bounds.  Yeah, but wasn't it also because he was taken out of the game?  Like, wasn't Greg supposed to be in that game?  No, I don't think he made a team.  Right, right.  He was...  And so he was upset that he had to just be the photographer.  Correct.  And he wound up turning the game around by being the photographer. 
[00:22:00]  So if they did that 30 years ago, we certainly could do this today, right?  Of course.  It's the Greg Brady clause.  Imagine they pull out the Greg Brady clause.  It's like you have a father that's a flaming fruit.  Oh, that's great.  Have a great day.  All right, brother.  Chris on Long Island.  So everyone's talking about that one.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  Yeah, that's just a bitch. 
[00:22:30]  Wow.  It's a bitch of a call.  And it happens all the time with just calls that people just go, oh, well, we got to deal with it.  Hopefully, you know, maybe the next inning or two, they'll have a retribution call.  Because they do that, too.  You know, if they realize they fucked over one team with a call, heck, a couple of plays down the line.  And they'll fuck over the other team to equal it out.  How do you equal this one out?  But it's like, yeah, you don't equal this one out.  Look at Leslie. 
[00:23:00]  Leslie Nielsen's risking the players.  We're not watching.  I know.  Now we're just watching the naked gun.  Naked gun is hilarious.  Leslie Nielsen is the ump.  You think that baseball is the only sport that you could completely get rid of, you know, umpires?  You know what I mean?  Or officials, I guess we should call it.  Take the human element out of the judging of anything.  Now, you would have to have sensors in all the gloves, I guess, right?  And the ball.  Because those plays where they're diving for it. 
[00:23:30]  I think just video.  Video may or may not show it sometimes.  There's some plays that will be too close.  Because umpires go by sound.  Like, they look at the, their eye is on the bag.  And they listen for the ball hitting the glove.  So it's really not a perfect system that they're using either.  Right.  Obviously.  Yeah, that's just rough.  And the balls and strikes can obviously be done.  Yeah, that's easy.  At this point.  With a camera and sensors.  Sure. 
[00:24:00]  But a lot of people, a lot of the purists don't like it.  I don't think I would like it either.  I mean, it is kind of, um, you know, thrilling when you get that.  Hey!  Yeah!  He got, he got him.  He got him.  He got him.  Top, uh, that was the top quarter.  The outside, top outside corner of the box.  Shut up.  The announcers could have been a little more enthusiastic about it, right?  The guy was broken up about it.  Oh, no, why? 
[00:24:30]  Oh, no.  I, no.  I, no.  I, no.  I, no.  I, no.  I, no.  I, please.  I, no.  I, no.  I, no.  The perfect guy.  Yeah.  I, no.  I got something for you.  This is what we should have, uh, heard last night.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Goodness gracious.  Oh, that's, oh, no, that's terrible.  That's just awful. 
[00:25:00]  That's just awful.  Oh, no.  And last night, Major League Baseball declined comment on Joyce's call.  What the fuck is declining comment?  Yeah, this is where we need your comment.  The whole fucking country, or at least baseball fans in general, are waiting for you to comment.  How do you decline comment?  Because the lawyers have to write up a statement.  What the fuck?  That someone's got to read.  You have to decline comment.  What good are you, then?  Bud Selig should step in. 
[00:25:30]  Otherwise, he's completely worthless.  Yeah.  I think he will.  You know, the other, uh, we'll see.  We'll see what he does, uh, today.  What's funny about this whole thing is it knocked Ken Griffey Jr. off the, uh.  Yeah, he's, uh.  Off the sports.  Retiring, huh?  Good.  Off the front of the sports page.  Ken Griffey Jr. is retiring.  He's out.  He's a fucking legend.  What is he, uh, fifth all-time on the home run list?  Something like that?  Fifth or sixth, I think, right?  Yeah, 630 home runs.  He's fifth.  And he decided he's going to retire, so he's, he was expecting all the, all the coverage  today. 
[00:26:00]  Hoopla.  No one is giving a shit that Ken Griffey Jr. retired, at least today anyway, because  we're all talking about this.  He announced it an hour before this happened.  Yeah.  Oh.  You dummy.  I never liked him at all because he refused to play for the Yankees because he hated the  Yankees and he was a Mariner, so I hate Ken Griffey Jr.  Mariner.  Well, then screw him all the hell.  Play for the Reds.  Uh, there was a rumor that he fell asleep during a game this year.  He's denying that.  Really?  But he is, he's having a horrible year and said, you know what?  I'm done.  Fell asleep during a game.  That's nice. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  He's denying it.  Yeah.  Apparently they needed him as a, as a pinch hitter in the fifth inning and, uh, and they  couldn't find him and they went into the locker room and he was sleeping.  Snoozing.  He was just, he's out.  He was sleeping.  He should have retired last year.  He's had it.  How old is he?  He's 40.  He's 40, but he missed so many fucking games.  He should have been the best player of our generation.  How many games did he miss?  Oh, God.  I don't know.  Eight, nine games.  He missed.  He missed.  He missed entire seasons is what it comes down to.  And he still has 630 home runs. 
[00:27:00]  Right.  The guy should have easily had 700 if he stayed sort of healthy.  He's just being lazy.  He'll never make the Hall of Fame.  Huh?  Oh, he'll so be in the Hall of Fame.  Was that a joke, I guess?  Yeah, I'm just kidding.  Oh, okay.  You're fifth on the all-time list.  Yeah.  But this guy, you got some of his, uh, stats there?  Yeah, this guy.  Is that him right there?  Here's the guy.  Look at this.  In 2002, he only played in 70 games.  In 2003, he only played in 53 games.  In 2004, he only played in 83 games. 
[00:27:30]  So that's like, quickly, that's a half a season, that's a half a season.  Not quite the iron horse, is he?  In those three years, he missed the equivalent of a year and change of baseball in that three-year period alone.  What was, uh...  In 2008, he only played in 41 games.  What was his big ailment?  Back?  What was his problem?  In 1995, he only played in 72 games.  That's another half season he missed.  Half season.  He's got to play whole season.  In 2001, he played in 111 games, so he missed 51 games in that year. 
[00:28:00]  What was wrong with him?  He was injury-prone.  He was always getting hurt.  I think it was them roids.  I don't know.  I think the roids kind of made him a little fragile.  I think he's one of the guys that no one's ever suspected of doing anything.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, a lot of people are on instant feedback going, no roids for the Ken Griffey Jr., man.  Oh, wow.  But look at all those games.  Maybe he should have used them, then.  I mean, players get hurt, obviously, but this was just, he missed a shitload. 
[00:28:30]  Shitload of games.  What was the final out of that game?  What finally happened?  Oh, I don't even know.  The next batter grounded out to third, so he got 28 outs.  How great would it be if Bud Seelig intervened and declared that runner safe, too?  Oh, boy.  Let me say hi to Eddie the Bookie. 
[00:29:00]  Eddie.  Eddie.  Hey, old P. Anthony.  Little Jimmy Norton.  How we doing?  All right, Eddie the Bookie.  Hey, guys.  Just like everybody know, the call on the field stands.  Anybody that placed a bet with me saying it was going to be a perfect game, as of right  now, the call on the field stands.  What if it gets...  Oh, it's funny.  What if it gets overturned?  No, it's not going that way. 
[00:29:30]  It cannot go that way.  I'm not even that close to a total right now, but I'm up $1.3 million if it does not get  overturned.  How many bets are you taking, my friend?  Wow.  Big time bookie on the line.  Let me tell you.  The call on the field stands.  I don't care.  Everybody in the northern Jersey, Hudson County area, I do not care.  The call on the field is the call.  Done. 
[00:30:00]  No perfect game.  Sorry.  I got your money.  All right, Eddie the Bookie.  Thank you.  We got to go back to the Brady Bunch.  You're usually good, but Ken is calling you out saying your fucking reference is a little  off.  What happened?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Yeah.  One, concerning the guy with the perfect game, one, it doesn't determine the outcome of the  game, so there's no reason to overrule it.  The only thing that would suck if the hitter who gets a hit taken away ends up batting like 
[00:30:30]  398 at the end of the season.  And that would suck.  Yeah, you just do it because it's the right thing to do.  Come on.  You're giving the kid a perfect game.  He knows he didn't have the hit.  Now, for the important stuff.  Right, exactly.  Brady got hurt in one of the football games in Cal.  Oh, right.  Right.  He hurt his ribs.  That's not true.  He's got to be a faggot and take pictures.  So that was the reason with that, yeah.  Also, with King Griffey, I'll do a little fun fact here. 
[00:31:00]  He missed part of the season because he broke his wrist playing with his kid.  So that dude was brittle towards the end of his career.  He's a mess.  Well, yeah, he just got, like I said, he got hurt a lot.  I mean, if you look at his stats, it's unbelievable how many games this guy missed.  Really unbelievable.  Yeah, it's incredible.  But even, like, you know, outrageous stuff, like, you know, playing with his kid, you  know, breaking his wrist.  When did he break his wrist?  How?  No, no, when? 
[00:31:30]  When?  It was during that time, I think when he was, maybe, when he went over to the, I think,  the Reds.  Okay.  He was always hurt.  He was so annoying with his bad back.  Enough already.  Right.  Thank you.  Steve's got a stat on how many games Griffey missed.  Steve, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I actually, I sort of read it wrong, but it says 633 days on the DL, so maybe that's  the same as games.  Oh.  Oh.  I don't know. 
[00:32:00]  Days.  I don't know.  Yeah, now I'm not sure.  I mean, how many games did he miss, and what does the average player, you know, miss in  a career like Ken Griffey Jr.?  He should have had the all-time home run, fucking, right?  Yeah.  I think he basically missed about four years' worth of games.  Four years, and if he hit a lousy 20, 25 homers in that time period per year, it's  another solid 100 homers he would have had.  How many did he have?  650? 
[00:32:30]  650 was the final, something like that, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, 630.  630?  Yeah.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  No problem.  Well, every news channel is just every so often playing that clip.  Let's see if baseball is current.  I bet you they're talking about it in Detroit.  You think?  Oh, yeah.  You think it's a big story in Detroit?  Sure it is.  I'm sure it is.  Of course it is.  Wow.  It's just terrible.  Poor bastard.  It's fucking annoying.  Unless they overturn it. 
[00:33:00]  But if they don't, baseball, here's what baseball fans will do, the same as all sports  fans, nothing, nothing, dumb fans will still, hey, it's part of the game, will continue  to get a big professional sports dick stuck in their mouth.  Yeah, the seats will be full.  Full.  Same as these dummies who go to the fucking football games and their teams suck, which  does not motivate the team to get better players. 
[00:33:30]  What do you think happens, though?  They overturn this or no?  Travis thinks they're going to overturn it.  Yeah, I really do.  I hate Bud Seelig, but I think that there's enough public outrage that he has to overturn  it.  And even if he does, though, what's going to change?  He doesn't get to celebrate.  He doesn't get that feeling of throwing a perfect game.  It's about history, though.  Oh, absolutely.  Get the team on the field and let him all jump on his back and, you know, do that homoerotic 
[00:34:00]  baseball player thing they all do when someone does well.  No, I think if it's overturned, this guy will be beyond psyched.  Touch genitals.  Hook in his ovation from the fans the next time he pitches.  And we'll be talking about this forever.  Yeah, he did an interview on ESPN last night where he said, he's like, I know I pitched a  perfect game.  So, like, what else am I supposed to do?  Yeah, that helps.  It's like, yeah, I know I picked the winning lottery numbers, but didn't get the money.  But, you know, at least I know I picked them. 
[00:34:30]  Terrible.  In other news, it knocked Ann's purchase off the front page today.  We're going to start the show talking about your latest purchase, but then you've got to  talk about this blown perfect game.  Well, of course, of course.  Well, I Twittered yesterday.  You sure did.  Yeah, well, you know.  You got another gun.  It was a nice day yesterday, so I had to buy a gun.  And officially, you're not telling anyone how many guns you own anymore.  No, I kind of lost count. 
[00:35:00]  I am a, I'm considered a collector.  Right.  I like collecting firearms and shooting various exotic weapons.  A very responsible collector.  A gun closet with fucking all sorts of security.  Yes.  Right.  And everything is legal.  That's very important.  Uh-huh.  To me.  Uh-huh.  And it should be to anybody out there that has or wants to have firearms.  You know, got to be legal.  Uh, but yesterday, yes, I did make a purchase. 
[00:35:30]  I went down to my, uh, my pals down there at, uh, Coliseum Gun Traders.  Right there in Uniondale.  Oh, boy.  That's a great place to have a gun store.  Right in the middle of, uh, of it all.  What the hell?  Oh, wow.  Oof.  That place.  That's a, that's a, that's a rough place to have a gun store.  Uniondale's a little, or maybe a perfect place.  Who knows?  Yeah.  A little iffy.  But, uh, I went down there and, um, finally picked up one of, one of the, this is one of  the guns that I've just really been wanting for quite some time. 
[00:36:00]  It is a, uh, a Barrett, uh, M107, 50 caliber sniper rifle.  I got one of those.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think everybody does.  How much do I weigh?  Yeah.  It's, uh, pretty heavy.  It's, uh, feels like almost 40 pounds.  This thing is.  Jesus.  It's very heavy.  Yeah.  Um, and, uh, with a full magazine.  Probably even more.  Those takes 10 rounds.  It's semi-automatic. 
[00:36:30]  But obviously you don't hold the gun, so.  No, you, you use the bipod on the front.  There's a, you know, full down bipod on the front and, uh, a little tripod, uh, for the  back right on the, uh, on the stock.  And you hold it a lot differently than you would a regular, um, lower caliber rifle.  But this thing is just insane.  I can't wait to go out, uh, out east.  And, uh, take some shots.  Is it 31 pounds unloaded? 
[00:37:00]  The shells look like they belong, um, in the wing of fighter aircraft.  Oh, my God.  They are giant.  Giant.  The difference between, uh, your normal rifle rounds and this are, uh, ridiculous.  Right.  Just ridiculous.  And, um, yeah, if you can see it with scale to something else, it's just ludicrous.  And it's just going to be a lot of fun.  People are like, oh, what do you need this for?  A lot of people, uh, very, uh, they don't like, uh, the, the fact that you can go and 
[00:37:30]  buy a 50 caliber.  Mm-hmm.  Um, um, 60 Minutes did a whole thing on 50 caliber weapons and they showed the exact weapon  that I just purchased.  And they're talking about, these can be used to shoot aircraft out of the sky.  It's like, yeah, well, you know something, um, it hasn't been.  And, um.  How hard would that be?  I would probably be pretty difficult unless, you know, you're near an airport or something. 
[00:38:00]  I don't, I don't want to sit here and give anyone ideas.  Sure.  But, uh, but you know what it is?  If you look at the statistics, I'd like to see how many times a, a, uh, a Barrett 50  Cal or any 50 Cal for that example has been used in the commission of crimes around the  country.  I don't think, uh, I don't think a lot of gangbangers are toting 50 Cals.  Tell you the truth.  And that thing's hard enough to hold up upright.  You can't turn it sideways and shoot it.  You'd look silly. 
[00:38:30]  You'd look silly.  That thing clears the field when you shoot it too.  I mean, all around you, the shock wave of this thing going off just throws dirt and  everything else around you.  It makes a giant bang.  It's very loud.  And, uh, the effective range, uh, up to a mile, can even hit a mile and a half targets  mile and a half away.  And that's what it sounds like, huh?  That's a, and then the laugh. 
[00:39:00]  Well, you got to laugh.  See, there's always the laugh when you shoot something like that.  People are asking, it's like, what, what, what do you need it for?  I don't need it, but it's like, um, it's, it's like, it's like, it's  like shooting darts and shooting off fireworks at the same time.  You're trying to hit your target and it's fun because it makes a big kablooey sound.  When are you going to fire this thing?  Hopefully this weekend.  Wow.  I want to go out, um, out East and, uh, blast off some rounds. 
[00:39:30]  Now there's places where you could shoot this thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's another thing.  People are going, we're in New York.  You're going to shoot it.  It's like not wandering around the streets of Manhattan with the thing.  Go out of East and Long Island.  So this place is upstate.  What kind of hold does this make?  It's not even about a hole.  It's about complete destruction of the target.  Well, you said something about a manhole cover.  Yeah.  You could shoot, uh, rounds through manhole covers.  It's, um, it's, it's meant, normally people think of it as an anti-personnel sniper rifle 
[00:40:00]  where you, you do make that hit on, uh, a terrorist from a mile away.  You hear those stories.  Uh, it's also an anti, uh, uh, light armored vehicle.  You could take out, um, one of those wacky little Datsun pickup trucks they like to drive  around with all loaded in the back.  Mm-hmm.  You could just shoot the engine right out of it.  Oh, the warlords?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You just blast the engine right out of that thing with this. 
[00:40:30]  It's very powerful.  It's, um, it, it, it just looks like a lot of fun to shoot down at the range.  And, um, and it's one I wanted to have for the collection.  And now I, now I do.  They don't sell a lot of these, huh?  No, no.  These aren't guns that a lot of people, uh, just can pick up there.  And, and that's why the whole idea that, uh, they want to ban, and they want to ban 50  calibers from the public.  They don't want people to have them.  Some anti-personnel, uh, ammo, some tracer rounds. 
[00:41:00]  What the fuck?  Explosive rounds.  Unbelievable.  Insanity.  They want to ban these guns?  Yeah, they want to ban them.  But, um, I don't see it.  In order, in order to buy one, you, you, you got to go through the hoops and stuff and,  you know, make sure you're illegal and, and, and like I said, these things are not being  used in the commission of, of a crime.  I think more people are injured by having them fall on your foot, uh, than, than being  shot with them. 
[00:41:30]  Uh, the ammo itself, I can't see, uh, buying a round for about $4 a clip.  Not a clip.  I mean a magazine.  A round.  Right.  A bullet.  Right.  It, it, it's, it's $4 for one bullet is, is what it, uh, what it runs you.  And that's just if you buy a bolt.  Fuck shooting it, you might miss.  I'd walk up to the guy and just stab him with a, stab him with a, stab him with a round.  And, uh, yeah, it's, it's another weapon from the, um, you know, video game collection, 
[00:42:00]  which I like.  People, people do point out that I do like buying weapons from video games.  Video game guns.  This is another Call of Duty purchase.  Let's say hi to Bill in Maine.  Bill.  Oh, Bill.  Yeah.  It's a, uh, I guess the, uh, Geneva Convention, the laws of war, you're not supposed to shoot  a, uh, person, uh, with a 50 cal, but you can shoot the weapon that they're holding and,  you know, best, or shoot the ground in front of them if they're in a fighting hole or whatever,  but you're not supposed to shoot a human being.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  I don't know about that.  I think that's that automatic 50 cal stuff.  You know, the guy that actually came up with the Barrett, his name was Barrett.  Uh, he, he liked the Browning 50 caliber machine gun, but very heavy.  You can't tote it around.  So we came up with a nice rifle that a guy can carry with him that shoots the same round,  uh, as a Browning full auto, uh, machine gun.  Wow. 
[00:43:00]  We're just watching videos on YouTube.  This thing is insane.  Let's go to Ron in New York.  Ron.  Hey there, Ron.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, uh, Anthony, if you're going to go shooting manhole covers or whatnot, uh, steel plates,  you might want to YouTube it, uh, there, there was a gentleman that shot an iron plate with  a 50 cal at a range and it ricocheted back and come back and knocked his earphones off  and just about took his head off.  Yeah, I saw that one.  Yeah, that, that was kind of nasty there.  So, but, uh, have fun with your toy because I wish I could afford one of them big toys. 
[00:43:30]  It's a, you know, well, toys are toys, but it's a weapon, sir.  It's a weapon.  It's not a toy.  Danny in Ohio.  Danny.  Boys.  Hey.  Hey.  I love this fucking show.  I've been listening for a long time and I just want to tell you, Anthony, I know you  think anybody can't pick them up, but they have instant financing on those things here  in Hillbillyville.  You can fucking buy them.  Any janitor could have a fucking bear.  Yeah, I've seen, I've seen it, but it's like anything else, you know, if you can't 
[00:44:00]  afford it, uh, the repo man's going to come and take it away.  And I agree, man.  I'm just, you know, and I have guns, but, and I'm, but fucking those things scare me a  little bit.  Just the thought of it.  Yeah.  They're fun.  They looked, uh, like a pisser, right?  They look like a blast, man.  You can fucking just kill somebody with one of the bullets.  Just take the cartridge itself and fucking throw it out of them.  The magazine is heavy enough to just beat someone over the head with.  It's, uh, I fucking love you guys.  Hey, Jimmy, talk to you on the fucking show last, or yesterday, Kavino and Rich. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, okay.  Thank you, man.  From Yellowstone.  Those guys were not getting it at all.  Well, that's because one was in studio and one was on the West Coast.  They're, they're, they're very cool guys.  Right on.  It seemed cool when I started, I, I said, you know, could you get a radio show that  was interesting, but I actually listened to them for a little while afterwards and they  were, they were not the cocksuckers that Ellis says they are.  No, who?  Jason also, oh, they don't get along?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Ellis has got a hard on for those guys.  Oh, I like those guys.  All right.  I like them.  I like them all.  I love you guys.  As you should. 
[00:45:00]  I love Steve, even.  Bye.  All right.  Bye, Danny.  Let's go to Drew in Virginia.  Drew.  How you doing, boys?  Good.  Talking about Anthony's 50 Cal that he purchased yesterday.  Yeah, we had an insurgent come in years back when we initially invaded Iraq.  The cavitation, which is the, the area that the bullet, like the, the air that the bullet  affects.  Yeah.  Is usually about four to five times the bullet width.  Yeah.  This thing had so much power, it ripped the guy's face off with a near miss. 
[00:45:30]  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  Look at the round.  And we're just looking at a video of a gentleman holding up the round.  Yeah.  The, um, the speed of a bullet usually, uh, literally boils the water in the atmosphere.  So as it's going through, it makes kind of that matrix bullet time, uh, effect.  And the spotter can actually look at that.  Well, the other thing to think about too is in the military field manual for the 50 caliber, 
[00:46:00]  the M2, the, the machine gun, the, when it, when it, usually when it designates how far  the bullet will go, it's maximum effective range.  It just says the horizon.  It doesn't give an actual, you know, the horizon.  It's a, I was watching a marksman show last night and they, uh, did that, um, one mile,  uh, shot.  It just showed guys shooting at a mile away.  Just insanity.  All right, thank you, sir. 
[00:46:30]  Let's go to, uh, JJ in Virginia.  JJ.  Hey, Anthony, great purchase.  Great weapon.  You're going to love it.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Hey, uh, as a Marine, you know, I fired that thing.  I'm not a sniper, but I was a battalion commander.  So I had a whole platoon of snipers and, uh, we used to go out to the range out in, uh,  out in the desert, hit things easily, 1800 meters.  Uh, you're, you're going to enjoy shooting that thing.  You do have to be careful.  I forget the number of rounds.  There's only a number of rounds you should shoot per day because concussion coming back  on you'll actually infect your, uh, internal organs. 
[00:47:00]  That's so powerful.  That thing is.  And, uh, the other quote has said it's against the Geneva convention.  That's bullshit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Any weapon, any weapon that we give Marines or soldiers,  you could kill anybody with it.  It's absolutely legal.  That's what you're supposed to do with them.  That's what they're there for.  And the, uh, does a beautiful job.  It rips them right in half.  All right, JJ.  Yeah.  That isn't even about just putting holes in, uh, your target.  That is, um, devastation.  They show people shooting cinder blocks. 
[00:47:30]  Look at this guy's holding it.  She does a video of a guy actually shoulder firing it off the ground.  Crazy.  That's what I found.  Oh, it did.  Oh, look at this.  Sounds like a howitzer going off.  Freaking holding it.  Uh, it, uh, yeah, it does make quite a bang.  A lot of concussion.  Like the guy said, but I don't think I'm going to be shooting, uh, a lot of rounds out of it. 
[00:48:00]  Can you go deer hunting with it?  Uh, I don't think, um, that's a good rifle for deer hunting.  No, no, I, I don't think so.  Especially if you want to eat the meat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think you'd rip the deer's head off.  I think it's good for bunnies.  See a little rabbit hunting.  Yeah.  If you want to vaporize them.  Uh, you, you, you, you get a, uh, uh, you get your scope dialed in with that thing.  You could hit some really fun, smaller targets at a great distance. 
[00:48:30]  Dirty D has something on that.  Dirty D, Arizona.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  What's up?  Hey, I just want to, uh, congratulate you, man.  That's a badass fucking weapon, man.  Thank you, my friend.  I got a buddy that's in Iraq right now, uh, working with Spec Ops.  And, uh, he says, yeah, they take out fucking engine blocks out of those little Nissan fucking, uh,  trucks that those motherfuckers are using over there.  Yeah, they set them on fire.  Yeah, be careful with that, because he says, uh, you don't necessarily have to hit the target directly,  but just the, the velocity of the fucking round, if it's anywhere near flesh, it would just fucking rip it apart, man. 
[00:49:00]  So.  Yeah, that's what the other, the other gentleman was saying.  Wow.  Right on, man.  Red, white, and blue, baby.  All right.  A lot of fun.  So this weekend you shoot it?  Yeah, I'm thinking, uh, this weekend, um, yeah.  And then, uh, probably next week sometime, um, on one of the weekdays early on.  Maybe Tuesday or something.  Go down to another range and, uh, take a few shots down there.  Yeah, just, because you need, you need a lot of, uh, room with this. 
[00:49:30]  This isn't one of those, um, rifles you could take down to the old indoor range at 25 yards and, um, start blasting inside.  Uh, I think, I think you'd get the range officer in there pretty quick as you're blasting holes through the back of the building.  So, yeah, this is definitely outdoor.  You need a lot of room.  Uh, set your targets at the maximum distance that, that the range allows. 
[00:50:00]  And then, uh, see what you could do.  You're going to try to hit some shit?  Dial it in and have some fun, yeah.  How far, you think?  I'm thinking 20, 30 feet.  Nice!  Let's go to Jim in Connecticut.  One more on this.  I would think 300, start out, start out about 300 yards just to see, you know, what I could do.  Wow.  First, you got a zero in your scope and everything.  It's going to be, uh, a lot of, a lot of money and ammo just getting the thing set up.  So, let's, uh, say hi to Jim.  Last call about Ant's gun purchase. 
[00:50:30]  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  How you doing?  All right.  Hi, sir.  Hey, uh, Anthony, I got a question.  Um, that's a, uh, semi-auto?  Yeah.  How many rounds in the clip?  Ten.  Ten rounds.  Can you buy extended clips for it?  Uh, no, they, they pretty much are just ten.  You should just go with the regular setup that they think is best.  Okay.  You could buy, you know, extra mags, obviously.  But, uh, yeah, ten, but do you really need more than ten rounds of .50 cal coming out 
[00:51:00]  of, uh, a rifle?  Yeah, I think, uh, Jesse James himself has a, uh, .50 cal that's, like, automatic.  You ever see that?  Full auto?  Yeah, that's got to be fun.  Have you ever heard of the AA-12?  No.  Not offhand.  You can go on online and check that out.  It's an automatic shotgun.  Oh, I've seen it.  Okay, I've seen it.  You have?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh, one last comment is, uh, I heard the bigger the gun, the smaller the penis. 
[00:51:30]  Is that true?  Um, I don't know.  I, I, I don't know.  Is it?  No.  A lot of people say that if you have a big vehicle, a big, uh, gun.  So now I got an Escalade and a giant .50 caliber gun.  I must have a little tiny Weezy.  All right.  It's got an embarrassingly, uh, large hog.  Oh.  We've never officially seen it, but we've, we, we just, we just know that's what's going  on there.  All right.  You guys have a good day, man.  He's got shame, right, Jimmy?  Yeah, he really does. 
[00:52:00]  About his bigness.  Giant cock has always embarrassed him.  The teachers actually, when he was a boy in school, pulled him out because they thought  he was an adult masquerading as a child.  You're an asshole.  He had to show birth certificates when he was 11.  There's a shame thing going on there.  Uh.  Humiliated him.  Yeah.  How do you swim in your pool with other people at your house?  Oh, I, I wear a few pairs of underwear.  And you duct tape it down?  I duct tape, yeah, I tape it down.  It dangles like a fucking wasp stinger in the pool.  A wasp stinger? 
[00:52:30]  Uh, now, uh, I just have one more gun to get that, uh, I, I need to find.  And that is the, like, civilian semi-auto version of the MP5.  Like the HK-94 or something like that.  I'm looking for, uh, I'm looking for that.  That was hard to find?  Yeah, that's kind of the gun.  Again, if you see any bad guy in any movie, he's toting this.  That's, that's what they're, they're toting around. 
[00:53:00]  Uh, so that's the one I gotta get.  Why can't you find that one?  Uh, very, very rare.  They're very rare.  They're very hard to find.  Uh, I don't know why.  I think because it's some of the, the assault weapons bans and the, the pistol ban.  Because it's kind of classified as a, a pistol.  Mm-hmm.  Um, so it's just, it's kind of hard.  How is that classified as a pistol?  Eh, I don't know shit about guns, but.  No, no, no stock on it.  Right.  Short stock.  Right.  Short barrel. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  Short barrel rifle is another classification, but you're not allowed to own one of those in  New York.  See, look, that's like a machine pistol.  Right, I see.  Yeah.  Okay.  But, uh, yeah, looking for that.  So, um, um, my, that's, and that's pretty much, then I can't think of anything else that I  really want or need.  Then you can relax for a while?  Then I could just settle down.  Danny's saying, what about a grenade launcher?  Um, New York State has a little problem with a grenade launcher.  They really don't want you having one of those?  No.  They don't like weapons that go like this. 
[00:54:00]  Funk.  Funk.  Mortars.  Things like that.  Anything that goes, funk.  They frown on.  We were done with the phone calls, but this one's too good to pass up.  Uh, PJ in Michigan.  PJ.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Happy birthday, T.E.M.E.  Hi, PJ.  Hey, Anthony, when you go to the fighting range this weekend, make sure you take an extra  pair of shorts.  The reason for the little.  Yeah.  And when you're done pulling the trigger is you cum a little.  At least I did the first time.  Oh, is that it?  You cum, you make cumzies a little bit? 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, cumzies.  You do.  You do, there's, there's no one that shoots, there's no one that shoots these weapons that  don't, that you don't laugh after you fire one.  And everybody watching just kind of laughs, because it's just, it's, uh, it's something  primal.  The explosion, the fucking, watching the round just hit something and destroy it.  Jeez.  Amazing.  A lot of fun. 
[00:55:00]  Right on.  Well, congrats on the purchase.  Yes, thank you.  Uh, we talked about the blown call already.  We're going to try to get mad dog on to talk about it a little bit, but he's, uh, driving  his kids to school.  So that takes precedence over, uh, yes, it shouldn't over our show, I guess.  I guess we can't support him anymore.  We need another sports guy that we, that is dependable.  My goodness.  Well, Dr. Steve has kids.  He was on vacation.  He dropped everything to make sure he did a couple of minutes, uh, on Bobby's smelly ball 
[00:55:30]  bag yesterday.  I don't think he was all that happy about being interrupted during his vacation.  Um, but, but, did he do it?  He certainly did.  He's a good egg.  Okay, that's my point.  Because he was plugging his radio show.  Well, Russo needs some plugs.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Does a very good job, but we still got to get the word out.  Is he on vacation?  On his mad dog radio thing.  He's, uh, taking the, uh...  I think everyone's on vacation this week, except for us.  Uh, after the break, Paul McCartney says everyone should lay off Obama because he's a great 
[00:56:00]  guy.  How does...  Sir Paul, no.  Hold it, hold it.  Eh.  And also, the Gary Coleman 9-1-1 audio after the break.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  His wife...  He's not even his wife.  Oh.  She's in New York doing interviews.  Oh, really?  Yeah, she's supposed to be at Caroline's this weekend.  Oh, you...  Oh, God.  That's what the rumor is.  I don't know.  They said tonight through Sunday...  Goddamn, Jimmy.  She'll be there talking about Gary after the show.  By the way, if you call this number, call Travis. 
[00:56:30]  We have one pair of tickets for every show to give away.  Right now?  Yes, but they'll call Travis.  He'll take the information.  Only one pair for every show.  Let's do it.  Jim Norton at Caroline's all weekend starting tonight.  Yes.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100.  Oh, God.  What's wrong, Ed?  What's wrong?  This is Paul McCartney.  Yeah.  Everybody gonna...  Everybody gonna dance tonight. 
[00:57:00]  Are they?  Everybody gonna feel alright.  Everybody gonna dance around tonight.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, no.  That's terrible.  That's just awful.  That's just awful.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Well, you can come on to my place.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Oh.  You can do anything you wanna do.  It's just soft.  The lyrics are so trite. 
[00:57:30]  Everybody gonna dance tonight.  It's all about Lenin.  Everybody gonna feel alright.  Everybody gonna dance around tonight.  Everybody's gonna dance around.  You don't like this?  No.  What's wrong with this song, Ed?  It's stupid.  It's got a ukulele.  Uh. 
[00:58:00]  It's got a ukulele.  Is it Lale?  He goes, ooh.  You don't like to, ooh.  And everybody's gonna dance tonight.  Everybody's gonna stamp their feet and feel the beat.  And feel the beat.  Except for his ex-wife.  And jack my meat.  Everyone's gonna hop around tonight.  Everyone's gonna stamp their foot.  Everybody's gonna drag their stump.  Yeah.  This song fucking blows. 
[00:58:30]  And it's just plodding.  It's just, ugh.  It's there.  I just picture a bunch of retards in his house dancing in a circle.  Oh, yes.  Knocking his Beatles memorabilia over.  Do you blame him, though?  He's done it all with music.  What else is he supposed to do, right?  Not this.  He's great, but this song is just terrible.  He probably should have never released this.  Have fun with this at your...  In your own home.  Some guy with Down syndrome, spinning in a certain...  Helicopter spinning.  Knocking fucking George Harris' last hat off the mantle. 
[00:59:00]  One in shirt with a hole in it.  It's spinning around.  Yeah.  Just breaking gold records.  Well, McCartney's saying that everyone should lay off Obama because he's a great guy.  Oh, is he?  He's a great guy, yeah.  Is he?  Yep.  Is that what the...  Just lay off the man.  Why is he saying that? 
[00:59:30]  I don't know.  I'm trying to find more info, but I don't have it in front of me.  He was playing down there in Washington, and he made a little statement.  He invited him down to the White House to hang out.  Called him a great guy.  Gave him some kind of friggin' award.  That's why.  Why isn't Obama being tougher on this oil slick thing?  Yeah, drudges.  Shouldn't he be raising holy hell?  Well, even Spike Lee is saying he ought to, like, lay into some people and start, like, 
[01:00:00]  acting like he's mad at this whole thing.  Yeah, he's not.  I don't know why.  Because there was another setback yesterday.  Just one setback after another.  And Obama's just kind of...  Yeah, the saw jammed up in there with a cut in a pipe, and then they got that fixed,  and something else screwed up.  They're not doing a good job.  No.  Nick DiPaolo's so funny.  He went on stage at the store last night, and they kind of did...  You know, he's like, how you doing?  And they were like, yeah, whatever.  He goes, what are you, BP shareholders? 
[01:00:30]  This is a funny dude.  What an ass.  That's great.  That is funny.  That made me laugh.  What a fucking disaster.  What the hell is going on?  Yeah, it's really going on what now?  40, 45 days or something like that?  That it started leaking 45 days ago?  Yeah, it's a ridiculous amount of time for this thing to just be spewing oil out with no solution.  What would happen if they just let it run out until it was done?  How much oil is there? 
[01:01:00]  I think there's a lot.  Yeah, I think we would have a major, major problem.  Really messy.  It's a pretty big problem now, obviously.  Really messy.  Yeah, the earth is leaking.  Yeah, it's leaking into the water.  And we're trying to plug the hole.  It's usually pretty, it keeps to itself.  Right.  That oil stays in there and keeps to itself.  And we could try to pull it out.  We decided we need to pull it out.  We made a hole in the earth where it wasn't supposed to be.  We sure the fuck did.  And whoopsie. 
[01:01:30]  So, why is Paul McCartney kissing Obama's ass?  They're friends.  Oh.  That's it.  And what are people doing to Obama?  You can't say leave him alone because he's a great guy.  But what are people doing to him?  Because he's a great guy.  He's the president.  This guy's gotten a free ride.  He's skating his whole presidency.  No one wants to criticize him.  If you do, you're a racist.  You get Hannity and Beck and Limbaugh. 
[01:02:00]  Those guys are the only three that really give him any shit.  Right.  Someone's saying BP is the biggest contributor to the Obama campaign.  Is that true, Ant?  I have no idea.  Does anyone know that?  But that certainly would be a conflict there.  A little conflict of interest.  Yeah, a little bit.  But the guy, he should be doing something.  Screaming.  You know, at least to look good, make a speech.  And just say, fix this goddamn problem. 
[01:02:30]  Or else?  Yeah.  Make one of those oldie time speeches.  What's the or else, though?  What could you possibly do to these guys?  Or we'll do it for you and bill you.  How about that?  Well, how's that going to work?  How about that?  What do we know about this?  You get that goddamn Army Corps of Engineers down there.  You get some, uh, you get the Navy involved.  You get everybody with all their resources.  And, and, and, I mean, for the love of God, the American government, we were able to come 
[01:03:00]  up with the atomic bomb when we needed it.  We can't plug a goddamn leak in the bottom of the ocean?  Come on.  Get some brains in there.  They're letting BP just do this by themselves.  What do you want to, we should just push them out?  Get them the fuck out.  Say, look, you tried.  You're out?  Get out.  We're going to do it.  And we're going to bill you for it.  I got the solution.  What?  Bruce Willis.  Yes, exactly.  Think about it.  Bruce Willis.  Oh, you think I'm crazy? 
[01:03:30]  He was able to drill on an asteroid.  Kevin Costner and his fucking brother.  Now you've got the James Cameron and his brother.  How about we go right to the top and get Bruce fucking Willis?  You get all the roughnecks from Armageddon.  There you go.  And instead of space, you send them down into the ocean where they have to drill a relief  well to take the pressure off of this thing and make a whole nother movie about it.  That's hokey and predictable.  Yeah, but at least we get a movie out of it, too.  Yeah.  That'll make people forget that their livelihoods are completely destroyed because we can't 
[01:04:00]  figure out how to stop this fucking thing.  How to stop it.  Unbelievable.  Let's go to Kurt in Toledo.  Kurt.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, Kurt?  I believe it was the Daily Report I was watching yesterday.  BP's got a new strategy now.  What they're doing is they're not worried about getting the oil out of the water.  They've changed direction.  They've got to figure out now how to get all that fucking dead shrimp and salt water and  water out of their precious oil.  So they're taking a change of direction in this. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, I got what you meant.  Actually, that's kind of Jimmy's bit.  Why don't they just move the ocean?  Like, can't you just fence it off?  Like, build a little fenced-off area and move the ocean?  That's an idea that they haven't even brought up yet.  Like, you know how you put a bell down there so you can have air down there?  They should just build a big cement wall, a big circle around where the oil is, and let  the ocean just go around it.  I like the way you think.  Sure. 
[01:05:00]  Why don't they get one of those...  You ever see those really deep-sea-divey suit things?  Oh, the big...  Yeah.  It looks like a robot, but there's a guy in there?  With the big, round fucking metal head thing?  Send a couple of them guys down there to hash it out.  How far down is it?  It's a mile.  It's too far, right?  No, they've gone further than a mile down.  How many?  In hard suits.  There's no sunlight down there, right?  No, it's very dark. 
[01:05:30]  It's very dark a mile down, too.  So you've got to feel your way around.  Yeah.  You've got to feel around and go, oh, here's where the oil's coming out.  You just feel it all blowing out and oily.  No sunlight and a lot of oil.  That's just got to be a fucking nightmare down there.  Oh, my God.  Look, Al Roker's covered in oil.  He's down at the beach.  He's in Pensacola.  That must be a wreck down there, then.  How funny would it be if an environmentalist thought a whale had been rolled in oil and  tried to just wash him? 
[01:06:00]  Taking some Dawn liquid and scrubbing Al Roker.  There's a talking whale.  Help us.  What is he doing down there?  How is he helping the situation by broadcasting live from a beach?  A literal Apollo fire.  Can we find out what Al Roker is doing down there?  How he's helping the situation, please?  Yeah, what is Al?  They're all down there just waiting for that pure white beach.  Look at that nice beach to be coated in oil. 
[01:06:30]  And they want that.  Yes, they do.  The news people love it.  They want it.  They want to be able to go, it reached Pensacola.  Yeah, they're setting up camp.  Here's a blob.  And they can't wait.  They can't wait.  They want this shit to end up on Jones Beach.  That's what they're waiting for.  Will this thing go all the way up the coast?  You know something?  For how long it leaks, I have no idea.  Would it get in the Gulf Stream and actually wash up?  Or would it disperse enough? 
[01:07:00]  I don't know.  I don't know the hydrodynamics of oil and water and currents.  I have to study that.  I'll look into it, though, tonight.  I was reading about it yesterday.  Oh, yeah?  Yes, I was.  What did it say?  You're going to be a Caroline?  I would never do a plug with an oil spill.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I don't find humor in dead aquatic things.  Oh, okay.  I don't play games.  I know, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  You know that I would never do that.  It said that what happens is if it gets into the Gulf Stream, the oil will ball itself 
[01:07:30]  up and roll against the current.  That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  Like a giant oil beach ball.  And then teenagers will play with it in 1950.  No one plays with beach balls anymore.  No, they really don't.  Everyone's too busy on their iPhones looking at clip pictures.  You had a stupid beach ball.  If you came in with a beach ball, people would fucking pop it and kick sand into your open  anus.  They're frolicking. 
[01:08:00]  They were always frolicking at the beach with beach balls.  This is great.  Shitty bathing suits.  What are we looking at?  This is the live feed of the oil spill, right?  Yeah.  Are they trying to maneuver in this shot?  Yeah, yeah.  There's a little robotic thing there and they're trying to get something accomplished.  What is that robotic thing?  What are they doing?  It's just doing some robot shit.  Oh, it's that Sticks character.  It's Mr. Roboto.  Mr. Roboto.  It's a fist.  Hey, Zach in Denver has got the phone call as far as this shit goes. 
[01:08:30]  Go ahead, Zach.  Hey, I got two questions.  A quick one that was real quick.  Is Jimmy coming to Denver soon?  I know Denver plans for a little while, but eventually.  Have you ever been to Denver?  A few times, yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Seems like it would be a good market.  Last time I went to Denver, I got into that Twitter war with those fat girls.  Oh, right.  Right.  Big fat person.  Zach, what else?  Zach.  Oh, fuck.  The other part of the call was great.  He said you spill a little fucking oil in your driveway and you get fined. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, true.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, you can't even open up your oil pan and drain it into the street anymore or the EPA will be all over your shit.  But this.  These guys just pumping millions of barrels of oil.  Just pouring into the Gulf, now heading into other states.  Can you go to Richard in St. Louis, please?  Yeah.  Because I see where he's going with this.  All right.  All right.  Hi, Richard. 
[01:09:30]  How are you?  I'm doing great.  It sure is fun to hear anti-government Anthony rooting for the Obama administration to clean up this mess.  I am rooting for, okay, all right.  I heard you say that because what I usually do is say less government in our lives.  But the government does have a reason to be there.  And there are certain instances where the government should get involved.  And this is one of them. 
[01:10:00]  Not taking my money away to give to fucking poor people that aren't doing anything, but to clean up oil spills.  Yes, dummy.  That's what they're there for.  And if we have a fucking navy and a military that is supposed to defend our shores, it doesn't just have to be against people that are trying to come over the border or invaders or terrorists.  It could be oil, too.  Get out there and fucking do something.  The good thing is we've got Anthony who can pick and choose when we should have government involved. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, shit.  I said that to him.  Jimmy is being an idiot by agreeing with you.  He doesn't agree at all.  What about my excitement?  I am not picking and choosing.  I had a little excitement there, too.  Because the government also takes care of our roadways, sir.  I have no problem with that.  I pay taxes.  And it goes to fixing highways and things that I use.  And that's wonderful.  But it's also based in capitalism where a company will get a contract and make money off of it. 
[01:11:00]  It's things like that.  It's a give and take kind of a thing.  When socialism is at hand, it's a take and give to someone else, and I don't benefit from it.  Therein lies the difference.  Richard, same name as the gay guy that tried to suck my cock in a tree fort.  You never got over that, did you?  Hey, I got one last question.  I should have said yes.  Well, that's what I'm thinking.  Yeah.  One last question.  If this oil gets in the Gulfstream, will it make it to New York in time for Jimmy's Caroline show? 
[01:11:30]  Attaboy.  I knew I liked this kid.  See, Richard.  They say you should take shelter in a comedy club in Times Square.  That is true.  If the oil starts surrounding New York and Lady Liberty gets it up to her vag lips.  And then getting back to the roadways.  Yes, sir.  Have you noticed that they haven't fucking fixed the potholes this season in New York City?  I cannot be happier that I drive what I drive because I can't imagine having a car and having it destroyed with the potholes. 
[01:12:00]  The side roads in New York City are brutal.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable how bad they are.  Where did all those bumps come from?  Everything.  The winter.  But it's not like just a typical pothole.  It's a weird surface.  It's extremely bumpy and really hard and it's not fun for anyone.  And we are paying our taxes.  Why don't we have our roads fakes? 
[01:12:30]  They cut that shit.  They cut it.  The expressway, too.  When there's one turn where I usually take and I cut the corner a little tight so my tire, my driver's side tire, is a little over where the lane line is.  Right.  There's a hole there that went.  It was one of those, bam!  Like, you feel it through your teeth when I hit that thing.  I was like, fuck, if that was a car, the guy would have been across the lane and looked over.  And they haven't fixed it? 
[01:13:00]  You see the hole every day?  Every morning I look and go, let's not cut that corner too tight again, Anthony.  This is basic shit they should be doing for us.  Well, they can't because they're broke.  And this is one of the cutbacks.  Like I said, it's like one of those Sims video games where you've got to cut some things back and the people go, they get all mad.  That's what's happening.  They're cutting, fixing potholes and shit.  There's potholes on, I think it's on Amsterdam going north in the 60s.  There's two of them, right?  I blew one tire on it a couple years ago. 
[01:13:30]  It's the same fucking place.  And this piece of shit city won't fix it.  And it is horrendously deep.  There's two of them back to back.  What about the road we live on, Jimmy?  Going up that hill, how horrendous it is.  And it's not, I don't, the surface of the road.  They need to pave the entire road.  That's how bad it is.  They do it on purpose so they have work in five years.  It's a way for them.  Don't tell me they can't make a road that doesn't suck your dick after four years.  You know what I mean?  They build, you know, Italian ice carts. 
[01:14:00]  They build, you know, hat stands.  They can certainly, guys who give bad examples.  Come on, they can build a bird's nest.  Go with the pyramids, Jimmy.  The pyramids.  They built the pyramids.  They lasted for how many fucking thousands of years?  And we can't get a road to survive more than a couple.  Yeah, there's a few potholes there.  That's a bit suspicious.  And that's Sphinx's nose.  They could have fixed that fucking thing.  Well, that's after thousands of years.  Yeah, that's true.  Come on.  All right.  That's pretty impressive.  We got Matt, who is a bit odd. 
[01:14:30]  Matt!  Thanks for taking my call.  I'm calling in about the Paul McCartney thing.  And he said we shouldn't criticize Obama.  Yeah.  The whole thing is, he means conservatives shouldn't criticize Obama.  Because liberals can criticize Obama all they want.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Whether it's about gays and the military or this and that.  And I would like to call in about the guy in St. Louis saying you can't pick or choose.  Yep.  When the government should help you.  Right.  Well, in this case, the government should help you because it's a federal thing. 
[01:15:00]  But the government doesn't need to tell you how much sodium needs to be in a prize or this or that.  I agree with this lunatic.  Wait, you don't want the government to have any kind of, the FDA to have any regulation over sodium or stuff like that?  You want companies just to put whatever they want in the food?  Well, they should tell you what's in it, but they shouldn't tell you what not to eat.  And that's where they're going.  Yeah, but that's not where they are.  Yeah, but that's where they're going.  When they try to do things like, yeah, New York City has been trying to have people cut down on salt, like restaurants not use as much salt. 
[01:15:30]  The saturated fats, things like that.  And one other thing, you can make the case that the federal government is responsible for the oil spill because they won't oil spill anywhere on land anymore.  Well, is that a plague?  Or whether it's, and they won't want to spill new refineries.  It is political.  You're absolutely right.  How about some new refineries?  How about we're able to drill on land? 
[01:16:00]  I like that.  How about Alaska?  Alaska would be the perfect place because you could clean it up easier.  That's just all ice.  You could do it with a squeegee.  The bears would probably fucking sabotage it.  They always do.  You'd think the bears would come up and do something bearish?  And you'd know who did it because they had little white bears with black oil all over their stupid hands.  I love you, Jimmy.  You're one of my favorite comedians.  And we used to love watching you on Tough Crow.  Oh, thanks, man.  Hey, Matt, what are you about?  You're in North Dakota.  What do you do for a living?  He likes to wear women's dresses. 
[01:16:30]  I work at Target.  Oh, yeah?  You seem too smart to be working at Target.  Well, thank you.  You guys have a good day.  Oh, you don't want to be part of these shenanigans.  Oh, boy.  He decided to move on.  Oh, boy.  He didn't want to jeopardize that Target job.  All right.  Yeah, I understand.  Matt from Target.  Hopefully, he calls back space shuttle Enduro.  Yeah.  Enduro.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, the oil thing continues today. 
[01:17:00]  And Al Roker's on a really nice beach waiting for the oil.  That's your update today.  Just waiting for that first blob.  Actually, the second blob since he showed up.  That's stupid.  Stupid Al Roker.  Dummy.  Imagine if they just came over to Al while he was sitting there on the beach without his shirt  and just kind of, like, pushed him into a garbage bag thinking he was a giant ball of oil.  They'd grab him with a mop, just try to soak him up.  Hey, I'm tanning here.  He's like, I'm not an oil ball. 
[01:17:30]  I'm a man with feelings and genitals and a stomach stapling scar.  The stapling worked for him, though.  He's hanging in there.  Yeah, it did.  But I hope that they stapled his stomach and made his asshole the size of a manhole cover  so whenever he eats, it just falls out of the hole.  That's what they don't show you.  His asshole's like Ebert's mouth.  Oh, God.  Yep, yep.  Well, Kenny demanded some airtime. 
[01:18:00]  Demanded it, Anthony.  Demanded?  Which is very strange because Kenny usually just kind of hangs out in the background  and doesn't want to be a bother ever.  But according to Sam,  Kenny has demanded airtime.  He made something for the show and it says here,  Kenny requests this be played once every hour for the sake of the show.  He made something for the show?  I wish it was taped like a Bjork fan.  Sam, is this true, what I'm saying? 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  That he's demanding airtime.  Why?  Well, yesterday he saw me cutting up the audio from the Lady Gaga Larry King interview  and came up with a bid idea,  insisted that it go down.  Yesterday when I didn't do it immediately  because I had other things that were more important to do,  he put up a huge fuss.  He went over and told Troy that I was ignoring him  just over and over until finally I said,  all right, let's go record this. 
[01:19:00]  We did his bit.  He didn't take any input on any writing.  He refused to do any writing.  He said he would figure it all out.  He would improv it all  and then insisted it be made and presented to you  and that you be told that it should be played once an hour.  And we have it.  And this is it.  We're going to play it right now.  Kenny, is this true?  Of course not, G.H.  Who are you going to believe? 
[01:19:30]  We have to believe you and Sam's the liar?  Yeah, Sam's the one starving from airtime.  How many shows does he need to be on?  This show, Ron and Fez, Serious Hits, Morning Mashup, Shady.  And don't forget his own show.  Yeah, Special Delivery.  Right.  So who's starving from airtime?  It's four, not from.  Yeah.  Who's starving from airtime?  You don't starve from airtime,  except when you're on the listeners  are starving for some intelligent conversation. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  And it's not a bit.  This is an actual event that occurred.  It's monumental.  See?  That's how you know it is.  Okay.  So this is you, Kenny.  Did you interview Lady Gaga?  Well, let's take a listen.  Hi, it's Club Soda Kenny from the Opie and Anthony Show.  And I'm very happy because I get a chance to interview Lady Gaga.  Thank you for joining us on the program, Lady Gaga. 
[01:20:30]  I would like to ask you my first question.  Jim Norton from the Opie and Anthony Show would really like to have sex with you.  Would you fuck him or would you allow him to fuck you?  Yes.  Now, there's a big rumor that we need to dispel.  Do you have a big clit?  Yes.  Do you love getting fucked in the ass?  Yes, of course.  Oh, Lady Gaga, they're telling me you have to go. 
[01:21:00]  Is that true?  No.  All right, just a few more questions since this interview is very interesting and compelling.  Are you a size queen?  Yes.  Do you like shit play?  Yes, of course.  Does fecal matter?  Lady Gaga, do you know that Jim Norton is playing Carolines on Broadway this weekend?  Yes, of course.  Well, thank you for your time, Lady Gaga.  This has been a very informative interview, unlike the one you did with Larry King. 
[01:21:30]  This is Club Soda Kenny from the Opie and Anthony Show, saying goodbye.  Goodbye.  I'm surprised she was so tolerant of you.  Oh, my God.  That was so bad.  That was so incredible.  You don't think that was well done?  Stephen S. from Bayshore. 
[01:22:00]  Dickie Goodman just shit in his grave.  Yeah, yeah.  Kevin from Connecticut.  This is fucking awful.  Ethan from Florida.  C-cucumber Dick is clearly lying.  It was very Dickie Goodman-ish.  I don't know if that was a real interview.  Kenny Badman.  That interview was incredible.  You have to give me credit.  Incredible is what it is.  It's not credible. 
[01:22:30]  That was the greatest interview that this show has had in a while.  Wow.  We had a nice interview with Jonah Hill yesterday.  George Wendt and this.  And you want us to play this every hour?  I think, you know, we're trying to, you know, we're on Starz 2 now.  We got to step it up a notch.  Yeah, you're riding in the fast lane.  Make sure we have some pop culture stuff for the people.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:23:00]  Wow.  All right, Kenny.  Geez.  I think that was clever, though.  That was good.  Well, the way he, you know, was talking and she just kept saying yes.  And he was stepping on her as she was saying yes.  You couldn't find another way she said yes, by the way.  She talked over me.  Oh, oh, she was talking over you.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  But did you notice how I pulled the answers out of her?  Do you enjoy shit playing with?  Yes. 
[01:23:30]  And she said yes, of course.  And stuff like that.  But it sounded exactly like the other yes, of course.  Yeah.  Well, I got the answers.  I did better than Larry King.  Why don't you go back and interview Mr. Jaws?  You want to do it like a Dickie Goodman?  Like a legit one?  With music and songs?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just have to feel it.  Well, I mean, the subject could obviously be the oil.  You have to feel a bullet.  Yeah.  If Kenny ever kissed a girl, I'd want her name to be Charlene. 
[01:24:00]  Here it is.  The topic would be the oil spill.  That's what Dickie Goodman would do.  He would get some big fucking story that everyone's talking about.  And then you find the music.  And then you ask questions.  And then it's answered in song.  Can you do this?  You know what Dickie Goodman would do, though?  He would interview the oil slick.  Hey, Mr. Oil Slick, what do you think you're doing out there in the ocean?  Right.  And then there'd be like a swimming song or some kind of like, splish, splash, I was taking 
[01:24:30]  a bath.  Hey, Mr. Oil Spill, what are you going to do to those beaches?  And, you know, you just throw the songs in.  What do you think you'll be doing in a few hours?  Sitting on a dock of a bed.  Right.  Perfect.  That's what you've got to do.  So you're interviewing the oil slick.  Good.  Mr. Oil Slick, you're heading to Louisiana.  What could that possibly mean?  The house next door to me was sold.  Well, you could just, you know, you could just go.  Every fucking day. 
[01:25:00]  Holy shit.  Can you do your Dickie Goodman voice for us?  Can you do some Dickie Goodman for us?  You guys just did the bit.  I can't top that.  Oh, Kenny.  No, we're just giving you examples.  You're going to interview the oil slick.  Two minutes.  Can we get this done there, Sam?  Yeah.  You and Troy and Kenny?  Where's Troy?  Tell Troy to start working on it now.  Does he know, like, pop culture songs and rock songs?  Yeah.  Oh, see? 
[01:25:30]  Look, people are starting to come in.  Hey, Mr. Oil, so careful with that cigarette.  And then you play Smoke on the Water.  Bam, bam, bam.  Right?  It writes itself, Kenny.  Oh, it writes itself.  You just can copy everything you guys just said.  Yeah.  Well, you could use other songs.  We were looking for Dickie Goodman to play, like, a verse of it, just one verse.  Not the whole song.  You got a little Dickie Goodman?  I've got so much Dickie Goodman.  How about the original?  It was so funny.  Well, which one?  Do you want another one?  Well, name the ones you got.  I got Batman and his grandmother. 
[01:26:00]  No.  Berlin, top ten.  No.  Flying Saucer, parts one and two.  No.  Kong.  Never when it says part one and two.  Kong?  No.  Mr. Jaws.  Mr. Jaws is the famous one.  Mr. President.  All right, we should just go with Mr. Jaws.  I thought you said that.  That was okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, shit.  It was extremely clever, to be honest with you. 
[01:26:30]  It's never right.  It's never right.  Steven S. from Bayshore says you've got to include one ABBA, or ABBA, too.  Yes, yes.  ABBA has to be in there.  Yeah, because Dickie Goodman loved the ABBA.  All right, here's an example of a Dickie Goodman.  And, Kenny, you're doing this.  You're going to interview the oil slick, okay?  Yeah, but I'll be overworked now.  I already did a bit this week. 
[01:27:00]  Why are you depressed?  Overworked?  Why are you depressed?  You've got writers.  You've got producers.  This is going to be good.  You know what it is like working with Troy and Sam now?  What?  They're holding me back.  Why are they holding you back?  Because, you know, I'm so talented creatively.  Here, play the Mr. Jaws so Kenny can feel it.  We are here on the beach where a giant shark has just eaten a girl's swimmer. 
[01:27:30]  Well, Mr. Jaws, how was it?  Darn-o-may!  And what did she say when you grabbed her?  Please, Mr. Please.  I know sharks are stupid, but what did you think when you took that first bite?  How sweet it is.  Mr. Jaws, before you swim out to sea, have you anything else to say?  I can't feel depressed. 
[01:28:00]  I can't feel depressed.  With me now is the local sheriff.  Sheriff Brody, the shark will be back for lunch.  What do you intend to do?  Do a little dance.  Why?  Make a little love.  Just arriving is oceanographer Matt Hooper.  Sir, if someone is attacked by a shark, what should they do?  Do the hot dog.  We are going aboard the fishing boat of Captain Quint.  Captain, will you be able to catch this giant shark?  I will.  I will.  Thank you, Captain. 
[01:28:30]  Captain, Captain, Captain.  When you catch one of these sharks, what do you feel like?  Like a rhinestone cowboy.  We've just sighted the shark again.  He's coming straight for us.  Captain Quint is shouting something at him.  Get your baby one of these nights.  Hey, Jaws, the captain says he's going to catch you.  What do you think of that?  Can't talk.  Uh-oh, here he comes again.  They've hit him.  Mr. Jaws.  Why doesn't anything seem to hurt you? 
[01:29:00]  Big boys, they're crying.  Big boys, they're crying.  He's coming right onto the boat.  Mr. Jaws, why are you grabbing my hand?  Wouldn't you give your hand to my friend?  No, wait.  Mr. Jaws.  That's not the way this record is supposed to end.  Record.  Help.  Help.  Help.  Oh, I'm so...  I could not be happier he's dead.  I can only be happier if he died while making that song. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, he put the dick in Dickie Goodman.  The fucking thing was played all over the place, though.  That was huge.  It was huge, and people loved it.  That was the original one, right?  Oh, the 70s were awful.  And he can't even deliver his lines right.  Mr. Jaws!  Mr. Jaws!  Oy vey!  Oh, Kenny, you could do that, right?  I tried to do it once before.  Remember?  It didn't work out.  Yes, it was a monumental bomb.  Oh, you're losing confidence, are you?  Oh, but this is an easy one. 
[01:30:00]  Sam.  Come on, Joel.  Bridge over troubled waters, someone said.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You know?  Duh.  Did you just go, duh?  Yeah.  Sam's got no room to talk.  We should criticize his...  It's one show.  Heritage?  Oh, damn.  We already did that.  No, he's so distasteful.  Why is he distaste...  Why?  He's making fun of the Al Gore after 40 years of marriage. 
[01:30:30]  The Al Gore?  Yeah.  What did he say?  Yeah.  He goes, oh, Al Gore and his wife are breaking up after 40 years of marriage.  We know who's to blame for that.  Global warming.  How are your knuckles shedding?  Kenny's knuckles are shedding.  It's from hitting the heavy bag, bare knuckled.  Jesus.  They're callous.  They're shedding.  Oh, Kenny. 
[01:31:00]  They're callous.  Yeah, you should do one of those, though, about the oil slick.  Mr. Oil Slick!  Yeah, do it just like Dickie Goodman did the Mr. Jaws.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Add in shit that makes no sense.  Colossians, maybe.  Yeah.  What's a popular song?  There's a few of them.  I don't know.  Mr. Oil Slick, what's your name?  Alejandro?  Yeah, exactly.  That would be perfect.  You just got to take a song of the time and throw it in and shoehorn it in with no apparent 
[01:31:30]  reason like Dickie Goodman did.  Mr. Jaws!  Louie Jaws!  We're going to do this.  We're going to do this thing.  You read, Mr. Jaws?  You're right, Mr. Hooper.  You're always right.  What a maroon.  Oh, don't.  Let's go to break with Kenny singing a little Lady Gaga. 
[01:32:00]  We look forward to the bit, Kenny.  Don't.  What?  So do Kenny sings the hits.  Lady Gaga.  Bad romance.  I want you ugly.  I want you disease.  I want you everything as long as it's free.  I want your love.  Love, love.  Love, love, love.  I want your love.  I want your drum of the touch of your hand. 
[01:32:30]  I want your leather studded kiss in the sand.  I want your love.  Love, love, love.  I want your love.  You know that I want you.  And you know that I need you.  I want it bad.  A bad romance.  I want your love.  And I want your revenge.  You and me could write a bad romance.  I want your love. 
[01:33:00]  All your love is revenge.  You and me could write a bad romance.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
[01:33:30]  for the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Anthony's favorite band right here.  That's what's coming up over here. 
[01:34:00]  The Smashing Pumpkins.  People know I don't like them.  I like the Smashing Pumpkins.  You, not so much.  Not so much.  Not so much.  Nye.  Gary Coleman is dead.  We now have the 911 call.  Why do we get the 911 call so quickly?  And how is this legal?  Look, the Coleman cooler was funny the first time I got it.  It's just like, yeah.  It's like this coffin's already got his name on it. 
[01:34:30]  It's kind of funny.  It's like cooler and it's Coleman.  But then, if you've seen it already, everyone has seen it.  You don't have to pass it on.  So you're saying that you want people to tweet the photo to your Twitter account, Anthony  Cumia?  Oh, well, of course.  Because you haven't seen it yet?  Yeah, yeah.  Is that what you were just saying?  And Opie Radio.  Because I usually look there, too.  Actually, I don't even look at mine, so you better just tweet it to Opie Radio.  C-U-M-I-A is his last name. 
[01:35:00]  It's easier that way.  My last name, we try to spell it, it's separated, it's a capitalized.  Opie Radio is easy.  You just send it there and I'll see it.  I already have to deal with a hundred sunsets a day, all right?  I don't need to look at the fucking Coleman cooler over and over again.  Oh, enough already.  You want to be blocked, send it.  Good.  That blocking feature is fun, isn't it?  I love the block.  A lot of fun, that blocking thing.  Love the block.  Gary Coleman, the 911 call.  How is this legal?  Like, okay, something goes down. 
[01:35:30]  You're making that holy shit 911 call, and next thing you know, everyone can broadcast it?  Yeah, you've got to make sure you're making that 911 call, and you're really giving it your all.  But as a radio guy, if you call a Chinese restaurant, you've got to tell them, well, we're about to prank you.  I know.  How does that make sense?  It really is odd that you can just then play it, but it's public record, I gather.  Yeah.  Well, Gary's wife calls 911.  They weren't married?  Someone's saying they weren't officially married.  Who divorced?  Gary unmarried?  Yeah, the report is coming out that they had been divorced for a couple of years. 
[01:36:00]  Huh?  Like, a report had come out that they had been divorced for two years.  But still living together.  But yeah.  Okay.  Because she pulled the plug, which is a little weird, because if she isn't really officially  family anymore, how does that one make sense?  She got to pull the plug on the guy?  Yes.  Yes.  An ex.  Wow.  That's fucking brutal.  Yeah, that's, uh, what's that about?  I'm sure that he's probably staring, opening his eyes.  Hey, how you having beep?  Just kick the plug out of the wall. 
[01:36:30]  Gary's wife calls 911.  She doesn't want to check on him.  What's the problem?  Tell me what's happened.  Um, um, I just saw my, I had my husband go make me come through downstairs.  He just got home.  I heard this big bang.  I went downstairs.  Blood everywhere.  Uh, I don't, I don't know if he's okay.  I'm not down there right now because I have seizures.  If I get stressed out, I'm going to see.  Okay, what, do you know what happened?  Did he fell?  His head is bloody.  There's blood all over the floor.  I don't know what happened.  I really don't know what happened.  I just heard this thing and I went down there and he's on the floor. 
[01:37:00]  What type of thing?  Huh?  What type of thing?  What type of what?  What type of thing?  Like, would they have, like, a crash?  Like, something fell?  Like he fell, yeah.  Send someone quick.  You don't even know if he's, like, going to be alive.  Because there's a lot of blood on the floor.  Is there any way you can go down there at all?  I'll try.  I don't know.  I mean, I can't.  How old is your husband?  Oh, you too.  Okay, good.  Somebody else that's taking out the ambulance. 
[01:37:30]  I'm going to stay on the line with you, okay?  Cool.  Yeah.  Is there anyone out there with you that can go downstairs?  No.  Okay.  I've just been kind of sick and, you know, like, I don't want to be traumatized right  now.  Are you conscious?  I don't know.  No, he was, like, bubbling in the mouth and stuff.  All right, what?  It's hard to hear.  She doesn't want to go downstairs because she doesn't want to be traumatized.  Well, she said she has seizures.  She'll seize if she goes downstairs.  That's what she said?  That's why this dumb cunt couldn't drive to the dock. 
[01:38:00]  She's worthless.  Wow.  She's a big, gummed, idiot redhead.  She looks like a horse fucked Molly Ringwald.  Enough of this one.  She's valueless.  She's a fucking valueless.  She called 911.  Gary Coleman's dying on the floor.  She can't drive him because she might have a seizure.  She can't go downstairs because the blood's freaking her out.  You think she could have saved Gary Coleman's life?  No.  No, no.  I just think she's fucking valueless.  Nah, I think it was over, Johnny.  You think it was over at that point?  Yeah, but...  Wow, you nailed it.  Molly Ringwald fucked a horse.  There you go. 
[01:38:30]  Wow.  She didn't even try, though.  Good job, Jimmy.  Huh?  She didn't even try, though.  Gary's wife goes down to check on him.  She did.  She finally went downstairs.  Hold on a minute.  Gary!  Okay.  Do you know if he's breathing?  He's moving.  He's acting him.  Making noise.  You can hear him moving?  Mm-hmm.  Gary, are you okay?  Can you tell him to put pressure on the wound?  Well, it's on the back of his head.  Okay, but he needs to still try and put pressure on the wound if he's talking to you.  Gary, you've got to put pressure on your wound.  What happened?  No, Gary, don't. 
[01:39:00]  Don't fall.  No, no, no, Luxie.  Can you believe where he is and help him?  He's leshargic.  I can't really help him.  I just need help, quick.  Okay, I've got him on the way.  I'm just trying to help you out until we get there, okay?  Okay.  I just can't be here with the blood.  I'm sorry.  I can't do it.  I can't.  I have my dog.  Come on.  You're just sitting like that, okay?  What the fuck?  She can't be there with all the blood, so she just left.  She sucks. 
[01:39:30]  She is terrible.  What the fuck?  She's fucking worthless.  I can't be here with all the blood.  How about you toughen up, bitch?  Your husband's dying.  Dying right in front of your eyes, and you and your dog's going back upstairs because you  can't handle the blood?  Thanks.  That's enraging.  It hurts.  It hurts.  It hurts.  This poor Gary Coleman.  Yeah.  This fucking twat.  Just got fucked at every turn.  These fidgets never go well.  They really don't.  They never check out well.  You put them in a red jacket with a lantern, God bless them.  They're so adorable.  He couldn't handle the blood. 
[01:40:00]  I'm sure it's no treat, but you get in there.  You get dirty.  Get dirty.  Do whatever you can.  Start giving him mouth-to-mouth, even though he's foaming.  Try something.  On the back of his noggin there?  Man.  It continues.  Gary's wife tries to get him to put pressure on the wound.  Okay.  Where is he at now?  On the floor.  He's just sitting there.  He's sitting up now, but he's like, no.  I mean, his head's all bloody in the back. 
[01:40:30]  And I can't drive, because, you know, like I said, I have seizures, and I've been sick.  Of course you can't.  It's all about her.  Of course you can't drive.  I can't drive.  I have seizures, and...  You know, at that point, you take a chance, and you fucking get in your car with the bloody  little thing, and get to a hospital.  Just awful.  Imagine relying on this fucking asshole with your head split open.  He's just sitting there going, I'm going to drop because of this dummy.  Oh, my God.  I'm going...  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:41:00]  You know, I can't do anything right now.  You know.  And what's your name?  Shannon Price.  Okay.  Shannon, can you tell him to try and put pressure on the back of his head?  No, I can't.  It's like all bloody, and I'm not trying to do...  He's not with it.  I asked him.  I said, can you put...  Okay, but keep asking him until he does it, because he may not be able to understand what  you're saying, so...  Is there any way you can go in there and at least give him a towel?  Hold on.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[01:41:30]  You believe this fucking cunt?  Wow, is she useless.  What a fucking worthless twat.  She's not even applying the pressure.  Bring him a towel, dummy.  She's like, no, I can't.  It's not about you, you selfish bitch.  Me, me, me.  Fucking selfish bitch.  Show a little gumption.  Her husband's dying, and she couldn't fucking toughen up and hold a towel to his head?  I got a question.  Was Gary at the bottom of the stairs?  He was in the kitchen.  I don't know. 
[01:42:00]  Oh.  You think it might be something suspicious?  Well, I don't know.  My first thought is she hit him with something, but, you know...  People don't die from falling, but I guess he did.  They had some problems over the years, didn't they?  Yeah.  I've read some things.  And she pulled him off life support after two days.  Right.  I hate this...  I hate his girl.  Um, he enticed me.  She got tired of him walking under her and then, like, reaching up and slapping her pussy.  She had enough. 
[01:42:30]  She couldn't even fucking apply pressure.  She's worthless.  What the fuck?  Hold on, yeah.  Okay.  I can try and find one for him.  Um, I'm just panicked.  I don't know what to do.  I was going to drag in.  I'm quite a fucking crazy person.  I just don't want him to die.  I'm freaking out, like, really bad.  Give him your shirt, you selfish bitch.  I understand.  We just need to try and get some help, so we need to try and get back.  Very cool.  I'm bleeding.  Don't go.  Stay there, okay? 
[01:43:00]  You have to put this on your head.  Oh.  Keep pressure on this, okay?  Hold this.  Oh, girl.  And your body, like, all freaking over.  Don't move, okay?  What an unsupportive, worthless woman.  Yeah, thank you, bitch.  She's worthless.  I'll take care of my own head wound.  Instead of her holding it there, are you going to be okay?  You're going to be okay?  Holding him a little bit.  She sucks.  Walk it off, dick.  Wow, is she worthless.  Take care of your own wounds in that house.  How did he fucking hook up with this worthless fucking horse gums?  Wow, he's four foot gums.  What do you think? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  What do you think he was going to get?  He was just looking at that, thinking, yeah, I'm going to.  Average broad's not going to hang with a Gary Coleman.  Yeah.  That's why she was with him.  She liked it.  And he was with her, yeah, because she was fucking crazy.  She sounds like she can't fucking do anything.  Oh, she's valueless.  Hope she dates Joanne Vandersloot next.  We're going to say it's a last story.  Vandersloot.  In a second.  We got one more clip, but then we're going right into that story.  And then we're going to move on to that car fucking creep. 
[01:44:00]  He should just be shot.  Yeah, we got some stuff to do.  But first, more of the 9-11, 9-11, Jesus, 9-1-1 call.  I don't even know why you're standing here.  Tell him you need to sit down.  You need to sit down.  Sit down.  Gary, sit down.  What's wrong?  Look at the floor.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Ready?  Okay, can you check the front door?  It's just calling up now.  You guys can come in and tell him to come in.  Okay. 
[01:44:30]  Just tell him to walk in.  I just got...  I'm gagging.  I got blood on myself.  I can't deal.  I can't deal.  She's gagging.  She's got blood on herself.  It's all about you.  I fucking hate this woman.  She topples over every time she gets her period.  Yeah.  I got blood on myself.  Just fucking falls over.  I can't deal.  What a selfish pig.  Gary Coleman walks in.  He sees a fainting goat on the floor with a string hanging out of it. 
[01:45:00]  She's fucking worthless.  Oh, she's ugly as...  Oh, look how ugly she is.  Oh, her big...  She has retard gums.  Yeah.  She really does.  Oh, big fucking Down syndrome gums.  Poor Gary Coleman.  I know.  He had to kiss those big guys.  I bet she would just lift her dumb horse lip and he would kiss her gums.  Oh, yeah.  She stinks.  Tell him to walk in.  I just got...  I'm gagging.  I got blood on myself.  I can't deal. 
[01:45:30]  Can you go to the front door?  They can come in.  I know, but I want you to go to the front door.  If it's making me gag, I want you to go to the front door and open it for him.  It's open.  It's open.  It's open.  Go to the front door!  I just can't stand very long without...  You know?  Okay?  And I'm like panic-stricken and I...  I want you to let me know when the officer's there with you, okay?  He's here right now.  Okay, then I'm going to let you go, okay, Shannon?  Okay.  All right, thank you.  Okay, bye.  Bye.  Sounds like just a typical head wound.  You know what I mean?  I mean, obviously, it was a bad one, but it wasn't like he had a severed fucking throat 
[01:46:00]  or something.  Well, he knocked his fucking brain into his skull.  That's it.  He was dead man sitting there.  But I'm just saying, like, she couldn't handle that?  She couldn't handle that.  Some blood pouring out of the back of the head?  Go to the door and let him in.  She's like, the door's open.  She goes, no, go down there and let the cops in.  No, they'll come in.  What a useless piece of shit. 
[01:46:30]  Just worthless.  Wow.  A lot of people annoyed.  Timmy in Staten Island.  Timmy.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  This fucking cunt.  How could you not be brought up on charges?  For what?  Being worthless?  Yeah, being incompetent.  You're charged with being a woman.  Guys, also, guys, I just want to add that I'm listening to you guys, I mean, for the first  time live, my brother's been listening to you guys for a long time, and he gives me, was 
[01:47:00]  giving me tapes of the show for a while.  Ooh.  And I'm definitely sticking with you guys, man.  Oh, thanks.  Thank you, sir.  Refreshing.  Refreshing.  And to show that the beneath, that the nail is in the coffin, Anthony, you fucking ripping  on him last week about the section of the city one way, and not a peep.  Not a peep.  Shut the fuck up.  You're done.  Oh.  Good job, man.  He don't care anymore.  No, he doesn't give a fuck.  It's ridiculous. 
[01:47:30]  He likes to punch the clock.  I call him one of those guys.  He punches the clock.  Oh, please.  And us?  I punch my cock.  What do we do, Ant?  Show's over.  It continues.  Yes.  It continues with the tweeting and the videos and the stuff.  And the stand-up and everything else we do.  We're like police officers, never really off-duty.  That's right.  Wow, we're amazing.  And then that fucking black hamster in the glass there.  Oh, now.  Come on, you.  Jesus, Timmy.  I don't know how to hang up on this guy. 
[01:48:00]  No need for that.  Where's the hang-up button?  I'm confused all of a sudden.  All right, Timmy.  Jesus.  That's terrible.  All right.  Get out of here.  She's actually very nice.  She is very nice.  No need for those shenanigans, sir.  Robin is very, very nice.  Yeah.  Freddy or Fred, very nice.  Ran into me and my kid on the street the other day.  Ran into him?  What a son of a bitch.  Yeah, he's very careless.  Oh, my God. 
[01:48:30]  Very clumsy.  Couldn't have been nicer.  Yeah.  Wanted to see the little guy.  A lot of congratulations.  That's nice.  Then he introduced me to his little daughter.  It was a nice little thing on the streets of New York.  Oh, what a New York moment.  It was a New York moment.  We also boxed side by side, too.  Oh, yeah?  We hit the heavy bag.  He's got a trainer, and I'm just trying to figure out how I was at it.  I guess maybe I should.  Actually, Kenny helps me every once in a while.  Trainers are the best fucking thing.  Well, they motivate you. 
[01:49:00]  It's not even motivating once they get there.  You just know that they're coming to your house or wherever, and days where I would not  get off my ass, I have no choice.  It does help, right?  There's no choice in the matter.  There was a day like last weekend.  It was beautiful.  Last Friday, sitting outside, and I would have absolutely rationalized, you know what?  I'm not going to go.  I'm going to go in the pool. 
[01:49:30]  That's exercise.  I'll do that.  Nope.  Get up.  Get in there and fucking work out.  How long?  Hour?  Yeah, I do like a solid hour with the guy.  I do about 20 minutes on the treadmill before he gets there, and then an hour of just lifting  and shit.  Right on.  It's fucking great.  And if it wasn't for that, you start out with all the best intentions, but after a  while, you fall off.  You get lazy, whatever.  Something happens.  You go away. 
[01:50:00]  You do something.  You fade away a little bit.  And then, yeah.  But this guy comes to the door.  It's fucking over.  If you have good intentions in one hand and good deeds in the other, see which hand feels  more fulfilled.  Time for some gymspirations.  Oh, God, no.  Hey, man.  People need a gymspiration to start their day.  Oh, no, they don't.  Don't spoil it.  Spoil it for everyone.  They don't.  Oh.  That's good. 
[01:50:30]  Dude chills every time, Jimmy.  That's what's coming in.  That's beautiful.  I don't like them.  I don't think they're inspired is what it is.  They're not gymspired.  They love them.  They love them, Jimmy.  But they're not inspired, though.  No, no.  I don't think you're really inspiring anybody.  A lot of people are really mad at Gary Coleman's wife.  She's worthless, dude.  A lot of people are saying, I'm telling you, she murdered Gary Coleman. 
[01:51:00]  We don't know that.  For what?  That's my first thought.  We don't know that.  Guy's fucking broke.  Let's go to Eric in Utah.  Eric.  Yeah.  What's up, Eric?  Sure.  Utah News is reporting that they are investigating his wife for possibly causing his damage to  his head.  Mm-hmm.  Maybe that's just standard.  They would have to because...  Oh, he fell and hit his head where?  Yeah, where did he hit the back of his head?  Where there was that much blood.  That means it had to be some kind of pointy thing. 
[01:51:30]  It's going to be on...  And another thing, that skanky woman he's with, all these people that say, oh, you guys  live in Utah, I've got all them wives, that there is a perfect example of an ugly fucking  polygamist wife.  All them skanks look like her.  But you started, you interrupted Anthony, because he had something you wanted to say.  Thank God.  Thank God you got your line out.  You cut off Anthony for that.  Thank you, Eric.  What was your line?  Ah.  Moments passed.  It happens.  God. 
[01:52:00]  All right.  I'll try it.  Good.  Might as well.  That means you know it's good.  Gee.  The story's going to be featured on First 48 Inches.  That's really fancy.  That's real good.  Okay.  It would have been good to be fast because the fast, it's the quick part.  It still worked that time.  Rick in New York.  Rick.  Hey, Rick.  Hey, did you guys see that article about the professional mixed martial artist that cut 
[01:52:30]  his buddy's heart out while he was still alive and ripped his face off?  Yeah, he was just a guy who went ballistic because of mushrooms or something.  He just freaked out.  But he pulled the guy's heart right out, right?  He cut it with a knife and pulled it out, yeah.  Jesus.  Wow.  That's fucking ruthless.  Call him off.  What?  Call him off.  As soon as I see MMA fighter, I think UFC.  This guy wasn't in the UFC.  Okay.  Punch it out, boys.  Thank you, Rick.  And Michelle wants in on the Gary Coleman thing. 
[01:53:00]  Michelle.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Thank you for that Jimspiration.  See, I told you.  Patty's sister?  You're welcome.  I feel much lighter.  His voice.  Yes.  Gary Coleman divorced this woman in 2007.  Yep.  Yeah, we mentioned that.  I don't know why they were still living together.  Then what the fuck was she doing over the house?  Yeah.  Busting his head in?  How could she pull the plug?  Well, we're confused by that as well.  All right, punch it out, boys.  I want to see if there's a life insurance policy on him. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah?  Well, P-roll figured it out.  She slammed the bedroom door and the doorknob smashed his head.  Poor little guy.  You get it?  He's small.  I bet he ran through the dog door and hit his head.  Poor little man.  Van der Sloot.  Van der Sloot.  What the fuck is this about?  Five years to the day of Natalie Holloway's disappearance, this girl winds up dead and he's being hunted. 
[01:54:00]  Interpol is looking for him.  He's just a piece of garbage.  Never went Interpol after you.  Never.  What was he doing in Peru?  Poker tournament.  He's a poker guy?  I don't know if it was professional or just whatever, but he was there for a few days.  And there are some kind of allegations of selling women into some type of slavery.  I didn't hear that.  Some type of sex slavery.  I heard that.  It was very vague.  He's just a piece of shit.  Yeah.  Yes, he is.  A spoiled fucking rich kid. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Who had an influential father.  Who was like a judge or something.  Who I think is dead.  So there's a connection between him and this woman, obviously.  She was found in a hotel room, I heard.  Yeah.  In Peru.  But her father was a guy who was like a presidential candidate at one point.  So her father's got fucking a lot of juice to it.  And hopefully, I hope he hangs himself just to get rid of him.  Yeah, just get rid of him.  Hopefully he'll kill himself.  Dummy.  That'll be it.  What's the connection between the two? 
[01:55:00]  They both like big Dutch cock.  What do you think, though?  I'm sure the family wants to know what happened to Natalie and stuff.  So would he ever fess up to it if he didn't kill himself before they find him?  Who the fuck knows?  But what do you think?  I think she's fucking fish food.  Oh, Natalie?  I think so, too.  I think he's too self-centered to confess.  I think he's a self-centered fuck.  One of those guys? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  He's probably a sociopath.  There are some people that just...  I love watching those shows.  There are some people that just have...  They love getting up there and just confessing.  And no lawyer.  Let me just tell you what happened.  And crack their over to fucking noggin with a shovel and...  It's always calm.  Okay.  And then whenever you see them talking...  Like, I watched a bunch of those shows yesterday.  You can't picture the guy talking actually committing, like, the crime.  Yeah, so, it is.  It's this very calm, kind of relaxed, as a matter of fact thing. 
[01:56:00]  There was a woman talking about dismembering her husband's body.  And she actually chuckled when she was talking about how surprised she was at how heavy a human head is.  She goes, yeah, I cut his head off and went to put the head in a bag when I picked it up.  And she kind of almost snickered, like, I was so surprised at how heavy a head is.  And the cop's just like, okay, so then what did you do?  Why'd she cut him up?  To get rid of him.  You know.  Killed him. 
[01:56:30]  Cut him up and then scattered his shit around all over the place.  Was he a bad husband or was she a greedy wife?  No, she was a greedy, yeah, yeah.  Greedy wife looking for that insurance money.  That insurance.  Fuck.  Yeah, there's some fucked up people out there.  That's why those shows are fascinating.  I hate the fake fucking crime shows.  You watch the real ones and it's fascinating.  They're way better.  People are just, like, because those are the real people.  You're listening to the minds of lunatics and they're talking like regular people. 
[01:57:00]  But they're completely fucking insane.  Not even a bunch of fruitcakes, my mother used to say.  A bunch of fruitcakes?  Yeah, like a whole group of people.  My mother would say they're crazy like a bunch of fruitcakes.  Isn't it just nutty as a fruitcake ship?  Not, there's more than one.  A bunch of fruitcakes.  That doesn't make any sense.  It does.  A lot of nuts and a whole bunch of fruitcakes.  Your mother was stupid.  My mother's a saint on earth.  That woman had a lot of friends that would help her when my father was away doing sales. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, he was a salesman?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Her friends would come over and they would do push-ups on the floor.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Would she help them?  Yeah.  How?  Sometimes she would make sure they didn't fall and hit the floor.  Oh, okay.  I really assumed that was going to be her solution.  Guy looked like Ving Rhames.  The connection is this, by the way.  A slain woman was found Wednesday in a room at a hotel where Evander Sloot had been staying 
[01:58:00]  and that she had been seen with the suspect early Sunday when she was killed.  How was that?  What was the cause of death?  Jimmy was there for a poker tournament.  I don't know.  The two were later seen entering the hotel by one of its employees about 5 a.m.  They were seen together.  And the Dutchman departed alone about four hours later.  So they go into the hotel together at five.  She's dead.  He leaves four hours later.  What the fuck?  What a piece of shit.  Guilty.  Guilty.  So they're hunting him now.  And now we move on to Carr. 
[01:58:30]  He is...  Yes!  Steven Carr.  He is a fucking creep.  He's just a complete scumbag.  We're such a dumb society to allow...  What's his first name, Mark?  John Mark Carr.  John Mark Carr, right.  We're such a dumb society to allow a guy like this to exist.  We...  You might remember this gentleman.  He was the guy that was in...  Was it Taiwan or Thailand?  Thailand.  Thailand, right.  He was in Thailand. 
[01:59:00]  And he was in jail.  He had done some type of crime over there where they were very angry with him.  I believe it involved children.  Wasn't he a teacher over there?  I'm not sure.  Yeah, he might have been you.  He's a teacher.  I'm not sure if he was teaching over there.  Yeah.  He came to our attention when he was in jail over there.  And then he confessed to killing John Bonnet Ramsey.  Little John Bonnet Ramsey.  So they went over there, picked him up, flew him first class back here to the United States, 
[01:59:30]  taking him away from a horrible prison life that he would have had over there in Thailand, I'm sure.  And then decided, oops, he didn't do it.  He's crazy.  He was just...  He's crazy.  How is that not a crime, by the way?  And let him go.  How did he not spend a lot of time in jail for that?  Yeah.  Wasting everybody's time.  I don't know.  Now, he's living in the Seattle area. 
[02:00:00]  Of course.  And he's getting a sex change.  Yeah, he's going through some kind of sex change.  And then he's trying to get some kind of cult together.  Yeah, little girls.  He wants a cult with little girls.  With little girls.  Oh, John?  Yeah, I know him.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Yeah.  He likes to have lots of friends.  It says he's trying to form a child sex cult.  I mean, can't they just pick him up for that?  Yeah.  For even thinking that?  You can't just say that. 
[02:00:30]  Right.  Can you?  I don't know.  My God, man.  He's a scary character, though.  Yeah.  He really is.  A child sex cult.  I don't think he's got that charisma.  He's got that David Koresh-type charisma to really get people on board with this one.  Well, I don't know who's going to be on board.  I think they're going to be forced to be in the child sex cult.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  I don't think it's going to be a free little kind of thing.  You know what? 
[02:01:00]  This child sex cult you're starting, it sounds like a good idea.  I like this guy.  Yeah, you could have my little girl.  Seems nice.  I don't think he's going to...  Gives me a chance to go out.  I don't think he's going to get it off the ground, Anthony.  Now, do they have any pictures of him as a broad?  Is he awful?  Yeah.  Sort of.  Like, I think he's already taken the hormones and kind of going through the process.  He is a creep.  He just has that.  Isn't he?  Why does he live?  I agree.  He does kind of look like the bad guy, the mysterious guy from Half-Life. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, well, there's no reason for this guy to walk around.  You wish the cops had just choked him.  Yeah.  When he confessed falsely to that, they should have just choked him to death.  Yeah.  Hey, what are you doing?  We're killing you.  Oh.  It's not good.  You have nothing to offer, the rest of us.  Nothing.  You're going to hurt somebody.  So, is this guy just looking for some weird attention?  You think this is a real thing he's going to try to do?  What are the authorities doing?  Are they following him closely?  Hey, Mr. Carr, what are you doing?  Looking for love in all the wrong places. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, why not?  Dickie Goodman would be proud.  He would.  Thank heaven for little girls.  Mr. Carr.  Is that an updated picture of him?  I think that's an updated picture of him, where he's growing his hair out a little bit.  Oh, he's hotter as a chick.  He's got like a softer look to him.  Yeah, it looks like a little makeup, but not too much.  Looks like a glamour shot.  Yuck.  Fucking just kill him.  Yeah, there's no reason. 
[02:02:30]  God, the way they treat these people.  I understand.  What?  He's got rights or something?  What happened?  So, really?  Are we just following him closely?  Waiting for him to do something wrong?  You always think that that's the case, that, all right, this guy's a bad guy, they know  it, and they'll put someone on him and follow him so he can't do anything bad.  You know what?  They don't do that.  Did he change his name and it was tough to kind of find him?  Really?  He changed everything.  And he has a Hushmail account, it's like Gmail or AOL, but it's very, almost impossible 
[02:03:00]  to trace, they say.  I'm sure with a warrant you can probably trace it.  Is that him by Jean Benet's grave?  In that last picture you just showed?  What?  Is that him sitting at Jean Benet Ramsey's tombstone?  He's still obsessed with Jean Benet and they got a picture.  What fucking publication set this fucking picture up?  Yeah, right.  To sell some fucking papers.  Yeah, again, you wish something really bad would happen to him.  Guys, someone should just walk over, take his head, and smash it against their tombstone. 
[02:03:30]  It looks pretty sharp.  He's just an attention whore, too.  Yeah.  A piece of garbage.  Oh, we're getting more info on Mr. Carr there.  John in Philly.  John?  Hey, boys.  Hey, just to let you guys know, they had an interview with his ex-wife yesterday, and  she was, he married her when she was like 19, and she actually is part of this.  She admitted all this stuff.  I can't even believe they didn't arrest her.  She went out looking to size up girls. 
[02:04:00]  She went to schoolyards to recruit them for the cult.  What a good egg.  Yeah, what a trooper.  One of the big reasons he's doing the sex change is because what he wants to do is he  wants to infiltrate daycares and go in and act like a nanny.  He wants to open his own nanny business.  Just get rid of this fucking piece of shit.  It's like, uh...  He's just calling up to try to help the show.  It's like Mr. Doubtfire.  You can find the interview with his wife.  It's fucked up.  She's demented.  I mean, after the interview, it was on with Contessa Brewer yesterday and somebody on 
[02:04:30]  there.  Well, why would we have clips of that today?  Yeah, it was all over.  It was really, really good stuff.  Punch it out, boys.  All right.  We'll take a look at that.  Thank you, sir.  We should probably should have clips of the...  Literal Jimmy, again.  I have Dickie Goodman photos.  I have his biography.  Hey, I can book Dickie Goodman's neighbor. 
[02:05:00]  Really?  I have an interview with his grandson.  He talks about the...  It's on the Discovery Channel.  Would you like the DVD?  Here's some more basic cable shows.  It's great.  I'm going to book that guy, Jan, who does the infomercial.  For the home-right paint stick.  Would you like to watch infomercials? 
[02:05:30]  I have a DVD of 10 infomercials.  Yes.  Look, it's Ice Truckers of the Serengeti.  Would you like to talk to them?  I'm a Serengeti.  Would you like to talk to all of them?  I've heard Ron Popeil has passed on us.  It's just all basic cable shows that we can watch.  Ice Truckers of the Serengeti.  Look, I have Cake Mixers 5. 
[02:06:00]  The crew.  I couldn't get the on-air staff.  We could get the icing guy that mixes the icing.  Yes, Mickey Ice.  He's very funny.  He does icing humor.  A very interesting story of how he got his job.  He said they'll make you a cake.  And I told him, I like icing on my back.  He wanted us to interview the guy from Cake Boss.  That's right.  Cake Boss.  What are we going to do with that guy? 
[02:06:30]  Exactly.  Would you like the show Pickers?  That's right.  Great.  You watch Cake Boss?  Never.  They had a marathon this weekend.  Some of the cake's like, oh, that's kind of cool.  Whatever.  I had to punch a hole through them.  Yeah, exactly.  What are we going to do with that guy?  Exactly.  Plus, it's fake reality.  So, talk about cake.  Would you like the entire two seasons of Little Miss Perfect?  Yes.  Oh, I misread it.  I didn't realize it said Cake Boss. 
[02:07:00]  You watch Little Miss Perfect, not the other one?  Little Miss Perfect pageant.  I might have to watch the other one.  Because during the...  Toddlers in Tiaras?  Did you see that one fucking little diva chick on the fucking bed going,  uh-uh, no way.  No, I just thought...  Do you got the commercial possibly?  Little Miss Perfect or Toddlers in Tiaras?  Toddlers in Tiaras.  Oh, okay.  There's some...  Which one do you like?  I like Little Miss Perfect.  I might have to start watching.  Because the guy is...  He's so gay, he could be no more gay. 
[02:07:30]  And the people just like...  They go to this thing.  Yeah.  I don't understand it.  Well, Toddlers in Tiaras has this one...  It might as well be a woman.  She's four, but she's like this fucking diva.  A diva?  And she talks like an adult.  Mm-hmm.  I...  Nationwide is on your side.  Oh, advertising.  Nationwide is on your side.  Right. 
[02:08:00]  Nationwide is on your side.  Nationwide is on your side.  Nationwide is on your side.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  Okay, that's good, Bill.  Bill.  All right.  Could you get to the video?  Thank you.  Jesus.  How annoying is advertising for...  Universal royalty beauty pageant is a very prestigious pageant system right here in Austin.  We have 95 contestants.  We have 13 titles.  So, it's going to be a very fierce competition. 
[02:08:30]  Bring it.  Cameron Fletcher is competing today.  Okay.  As well as his new baby brother.  Get ready, because Eaton Wood is in the house.  She is a very seasoned professional.  Yes, that's my name.  I know that mom is about to win.  I'm pinned and ready for the stage.  Yes, you are.  For Sterling.  Man, it's competing.  Now, who's going to win?  Good luck.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Ashton, please just stay in school, please.  No, this isn't the one.  I'm a little stressed out.  These mothers are always fucking horrible. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  They're the worst.  Fucking mediocre women.  Pageant moms.  Just dragging their kids to these fucking refuge of pedophiles.  It's so sickening.  Pageants are all dogs.  This isn't the one.  Nice teeth, bitch.  Her big fucking Shelly Duvall teeth.  She should be fucking wearing a robe.  They whore these girls up and put those big dumb wigs on them and the eye makeup.  A little whining, go on a few tones and a few diva moments. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, Uncle Paul, when they start crying like that.  Yeah, Tattletail.  You look so spiffy.  See, this is different.  It doesn't take too long to get the boys together.  Yeah, no.  Toddlers and tiaras, there's like fucking infants that they're throwing out there.  I would only approve of this if the losing children were beaten sadistically in front of everybody. 
[02:10:00]  With the winning children.  With switches and belts and high heels.  Oh, they're disasters.  Look at this woman.  She looks like Arthur's father.  From the movie Arthur.  Yes.  She was terrible.  No, it's a video of this.  She's like the littlest diva.  And she talks like a fucking adult.  And bosses everybody around.  And they've shown it on TLC over and over and over again.  The signature competition in Little Miss Perfect is the Wowware competition. 
[02:10:30]  That's what it's known for.  And this is where we dress young girls up like total fucking hose bags.  And have them parade on the stage.  And do little acts.  And dress and play characters.  That's pretty much what the guy says.  It's almost like a weird exception of pedophile thoughts.  It's a weird culture of we know there's pedophiles in this country.  And there's a certain legitimacy to how they feel.  And just let them sit there.  There can never be more than what looks to be about 25 people in this audience. 
[02:11:00]  Sitting on these chairs in this bad hotel like conference room type thing.  Or a little hall or something.  You think they scream for predators?  Or you think a few of them get through?  Oh, a few gotta get through.  You think they get through?  Just sit there and it's like, wait a minute.  You have no kids in this contest.  You're sitting in the back there jerking off.  Eating a sandwich.  Yeah.  Checking out what's going on on stage.  You think they start getting all riled up. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, yeah.  Get a big fucking hard on.  They have hard on pokers.  They dress them up like the wow wear thing is nothing but a burlesque show with children.  Put in TLC, Danny.  Maybe that'll help.  I don't know.  It doesn't matter that much, I guess.  Because we got Justin Vandersloot on the phone right here.  Jordan.  An exclusive interview.  Yes.  Justin, what's going on?  They're looking for you.  I heard.  People are looking for me. 
[02:12:00]  If they want to find me, I'm going to be at Caroline's this weekend.  Yay.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  How about Joran Vandersloot?  Will he be there, Justin?  You got me.  Yeah, we really thought it was him.  Jim, I want to ask you a question.  It's his brother, Justin.  Yes, Justin.  I seen you back in February at the Comics Anonymous show, and I thought sometime in June  it was supposed to be aired.  Do you know anything about that?  I do not know.  They have told us nothing about that. 
[02:12:30]  I don't know what it's going to air.  That was an outstanding show.  I never got through to tell you that.  Thank you, brother.  Outstanding.  Thanks, man.  Yeah, I don't know, but I have not been told.  Punch it out.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you, Justin.  You got to do this move.  One of the moves.  That's what they do?  The girls?  Yeah, they puck at their lips.  They make it look like they're putting their hand over their eyes, like they're blocking  the sun.  And then they puck at their lips, and then they move their head back and forth.  They go, mm, mm, mm.  And then they do the Macaulay Culkin thing a lot, where they open their mouth and smack 
[02:13:00]  their cheeks.  Fuck.  What the fuck is wrong with these mothers?  And then they smack their ass cheeks.  Yeah.  What is wrong with them?  I don't understand the attraction.  The mothers, at least you know, the mothers are basically worthless.  Who didn't get where they wanted to go?  That's exactly it.  You watch those shows, it's exactly it.  You know what, these fucking, these women who are devoid of anything real, but I don't  understand who watches it.  Oh, well, I, it's kind of fun.  Well, you just watch the radio show. 
[02:13:30]  To watch, it's, well, no, it is kind of funny to watch.  I like when the kids cry.  Oh, you said you like the guy, because he's like, really fucking strange.  The guy's very gay.  I like when the kids cry because they're having problems with the hairspray, they don't like  that, or the dress hurts them.  And they're like, eh.  This one kid had a bad stomach ache and had to take a shit, so she couldn't fucking make  the finals.  It's just too fucking funny.  How annoying is it? 
[02:14:00]  And he sings a little song each time.  Little Miss Perfect Pageant, where all your dreams come true.  This is sickening.  They put in false teeth that their teeth are falling out.  Yeah.  It's a parade of whores.  You're just sexualizing children.  That's all you're doing.  So just say what it is.  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.  Say what it is.  You accept a certain element of pedophilia in the country, and you're sexualizing kids. 
[02:14:30]  How is it accepted in this forum?  Because they're accepting quietly that guys are going to jerk off to this.  It's unacceptable.  There's no reason to do it.  Beauty pageants in themselves are worthless, but this is truly fucking valueless.  I think you're right.  I know I am.  I think you're right.  Any parent who puts your kid through this, you're a shit parent.  Someone wrote over here, one mother was pointing out that her kid had a fat tummy. 
[02:15:00]  She was four years old.  That's healthy.  Look at her whore eyes.  If a girl's made up like that, what are you thinking?  What are you thinking?  She looks like she's fucking 16.  It's stupid.  She shouldn't.  Right.  Ooh, that one right there.  Yeah.  I thought you were mad, Jimmy.  The ones that look like Jean Benet are really fucking disturbing.  Why would you do that? 
[02:15:30]  Look at that.  With the lipstick on a four-year-old, really?  Yeah.  With their little puffy lips.  And they just whore up their eyeballs.  What would TLC say?  Because I know one of these shows is on TLC.  Don't know.  What would their logic be to running this show?  They'd have some dog shit fucking reason.  Well, we're just, you know, we're just...  It's going on.  That's what we're...  Well, TLC is pretty much the freak show channel.  We've talked about that over the years.  But I think this is going a little too far in that freak show genre.  And this is different than putting boys in tuxedos or dressing them like adults because 
[02:16:00]  that doesn't sexualize them.  This is sexualizing them.  You've got to spill paint on the boys.  Photographs.  And this is what these mothers would say.  Well, it's not sexual.  If you think it's sexual, they would try to put the onus on you for calling them out  for what it is.  And you have the problem.  Yeah, but no, I know what it is.  Right.  And the other show, like Anne said, they do wow wear.  I mean, what do you think that is?  Yeah, that's this one.  What kind of wow are they going for?  Well, the wow wear segment is, this is where the contestant gets a chance to wow the judges 
[02:16:30]  with their costumes.  Is that him?  Yeah.  That's the gayest man in the world singing his song.  Little Miss Perfect Pageant  Where all your dreams come true  Little Miss Perfect Pageant  Where the special one is you  There are citrus-colored rainbows 
[02:17:00]  Someone's taping this off the TV and laughing at him.  Look at this creep.  Just looking right into the girl's face.  Some of these mothers finding meaning in it.  Something gets jazzy  If you think it  And want it  Dream it  And it's real  Oh, he's terrible, so  Sings it every time  You are what you feel 
[02:17:30]  Yeah  Ladies and gentlemen  The top five finalists  Little Miss Perfect  You know what it is?  It's parents who are, again, have nothing to offer anybody  Trying to get a validation  Yeah  Through the fact that they somehow, their awful dick and pussy  Pumped out an attractive kid  Little Miss Perfect Pageant  I think I shot my goo  Little Miss Perfect Pageant  I wish they had penises too 
[02:18:00]  He's the gayest  Let's go to Dana  Dana  Dana  Dana  What's up, you guys?  Thank you, Dana  Hello  How are you?  Hi, hello  Good morning  So, anyways, what I want to call you guys  Who's salutations do we need?  Really?  She's excited to be on the show  I'm sorry, Dana  With such big radio stars  Go ahead  What's up, Dana?  Oh, I'm sorry  Go ahead  That little girl, the four-year-old that you guys were talking about also on the show  Yeah 
[02:18:30]  Not only does she boss around her parents and her choreographer  She's standing there talking with a binky in her mouth with a pacifier  And I just think it's totally outrageous that she can speak that well  With a binky in her mouth  And I'm telling you  We haven't found the audio yet, but it's really creepy  God only knows why she could talk with a binky in her mouth  She's got the binky in the mouth, takes it out to fucking boss everybody around like a diva  Yeah  Really, really strange 
[02:19:00]  That's great  Anyway, so  We'll try to find some video of that girl  Thank you  There's a new season of Little Miss Perfect  And I know I've seen too many of them when I recognized one of the girls a year later  And she wasn't even the focus of the show  There was this white trash girl named Shelby  And she couldn't  And the mother was  She's like glue gunning rhinestones onto this piece of shit  Fucking  This piece of shit  Thrift store dress 
[02:19:30]  And she was just the worst  And then a year later  It's like  I'm watching  I think that was Shelby  And it was  You drive a Shelby  What a creep  Yeah  And what do the husbands do  I've seen  They're called pageant dads  I've only seen a few  Opie  They're called pageant dads  They look like they're not into it is what I'm getting at  Some of them are not  They got some blue collar job  And they come home  And they're handing over the money to the wife 
[02:20:00]  So she could go with the kid into these pageants  Yeah  It looks like most of these guys are really annoyed  Most of them are  Some of them though  They're like what the fuck  They're totally into it  Really  Yeah they sit there and cheer  They cheer on  Like one guy is in the military  And he had his uniform on  And he was the one that brought out his little whore bag  To do some fucking strip tease  And some pseudo military outfit  And salute  So that's pretty creepy too 
[02:20:30]  They're very secretive with their props  There was one girl that had to get out of a genie lamp  That was smoking  And they take the prop and hide it  So the competition doesn't see it  Why?  I don't know why  It's not like they're going to whip something up  In these Holiday Inn hotel rooms  While they're waiting to fucking  Pimp out their little daughters  Yeah these pageants are held in the worst hotels in America  Welcome to the Ramada Inn  Horrible  Here outside of Orlando  Yeah  We're in Georgia 
[02:21:00]  We're here in  In Savannah  Well we're about 10 miles outside Savannah  For Little Miss Perfect Southern Belle  A stale danish and coffee that's like 2 years old  That's what the hotel offers to everybody  Get your free continental breakfast  Before showtime  Yuck  Yeah  Alright  Hey we got Otto coming in today  Whatto  Is there Watto coming in today?  Watto  And Vinnie Brand from the Stress Factory  I think Otto's playing the Stress Factory tonight 
[02:21:30]  Oh  I believe  That's a good one  Yeah that's good  That would be a good one to go see  Oh yeah  Yeah  Little Miss Perfect Pageant  Where all your dreams come true  Little Miss Perfect Pageant  I've got my dick in you  That guy's terrible  He's such a fruit  Alright 
[02:22:00]  We're back  The Opie and Anthony show  I have asked those two bums to leave the studio  I am here by myself  With Danny  Some shit's been stirred up here  Been some firings  Apparently Anthony is now coming back in  He's been rehired  Would you think I was a dick  If that 13 seconds alone changed me  And I all of a sudden  Started just talking over everybody  And  I would think that would be 
[02:22:30]  Kind of silly of you  I'm enjoying some cereal by the way  Ooh  I had a toil over what I was going to eat  I was toiling  I went with tuna on white toast  That's good  Mmm  That's so lovely  Yes  Otto  Hi Otto  Your arms look big right now  By the way  Your forearms  Do they?  Yeah  They look good  Hi Otto  I'm fucking ripping now  My muscle mass builds pretty fast  You got the fucking  What the hell they call that 
[02:23:00]  The DNA  The fucking  The genes  Yeah  I mean Jimmy were just discussing acid reflux  In the bathroom  I didn't  I didn't sleep a wink last night man  You got the acid reflux there  I don't know  I've had heartburn  I thought I was having a massive heart attack last night  Really?  I was seconds away from calling 911  And getting an ambulance  I'm like I think this is a heart attack  I get this horrible horrible acid reflux  Like once a year  I haven't had in so long  Don't you eat healthy?  Yeah  Did you eat too late? 
[02:23:30]  There was a tomato avocado salad in the fridge that I'm starting to think  Did you have some milk?  That I'm starting to think was a bit suspicious  You know when your freezer kind of  You know when your refrigerator kind of makes things a little too cold?  Yeah  It was suspicious and I ate it  So now I'm starting to think that maybe this was some kind of reaction to that  When in doubt throw it out  Mom always said  Yeah  You're a hypochondriac  You don't need to go to the hospital  It's heartburn  Dude  When in doubt throw him out  Drunk  It was more than just heartburn on him 
[02:24:00]  I didn't sleep  Really?  It was waking me up all night  It feels like foamy  Acid reflux foam just coming up  And I tasted bile in the back of my throat  It was a bad fucking night  How's the baby?  I never saw you since you had your child  I'm so glad you care about my acid reflux and go right onto the baby floor  I'm telling you I almost fucking died last night  Oh how's the baby?  Nice  I was like a nana today  Really? 
[02:24:30]  What the fuck?  Did you eat something?  Perhaps it was that  How's the baby?  They scared my bag downstairs  I'm in a good mood  Give me a little sympathy on the acid reflux  And then we'll talk baby until I'm blue in the face  Oh okay  Fuck it was a bad night  You don't know what it was?  What caused it though?  It was a bad fucking night  No I mean  I was on the  I was telling Jimmy all this in the bathroom  I was on the acid effects for a while  Because you take one in the morning and one at night  And it takes care of acid reflux  But then it got to the point where I didn't need it anymore  No symptoms, nothing  So it's been about four months 
[02:25:00]  And out of nowhere last night  I'm sitting around watching a little hockey  And it just started  And it got worse and worse  And it kept me up the entire fucking night  Nothing, one of those like  Sorry to hear that  Tums doesn't work for you or anything  Sorry to hear that  I'm going to smash your fucking face  I'm telling you  I'm hurting over here  Jesus  I'm hurting  Very hinged  Why would I try to get sympathy from these guys?  Well you know what Charles Manson said  Is it hot in here or am I crazy?  I cannot know  I can't believe they have those 
[02:25:30]  Tables and chairs  Are you trying to move on?  I'm telling you I'm dying  You're fine now  You're in the pain  Stop it  I am kind of fine  I'm dying  But now I'm just fucking really tired  What were you saying?  Tums in?  I think Tums in  Doesn't work?  I think those are the worst thing you could do  When you have the acid reflux  I just mean for like  You know  Once in a blue moon  When you get it  This is way more than a little  Once in a blue moon  Fucking little thing  Maybe you need a script  Maybe that's not enough  You sound 
[02:26:00]  A script  Acting is not going to help this  Oh Chip  Ass effects is a script, Otto  And I got scoped  And everything turned out fine  You take the silly name medicine  Ass effects  Ass effects  I take ass effects  Ass effects  Yes  I take effects my ass  And Dr. Steve can't figure it out  I got all the tests  And just every once in a while  I get this fucking thing  That feels like  It's a massive heart attack  He elevates your feet?  Really?  No you have to elevate 
[02:26:30]  I have no idea  The top half  You basically gotta try sleeping  Like you're in a chair  Like fucking Rocky Dennis  Do you feel  Yeah  Do you feel overwhelmed  By the fatherhood thing  Maybe?  No  It's psychological  No  Not really  Dr. Steve's a dumb cluck  His car  And he spells it  D-O-K  T-E-R  He's a fraud  Cluck  Clack  Cluck  A cluck  I like cluck  We don't do a lot of baby talk 
[02:27:00]  On the show  Because I've watched that  Ruin other radio shows  But I'll tell you really quickly  Yeah I just thought  I would be a human being  For four seconds  Before we  You had a chance to be a human being  With the fact that I was dying last night  Let's get some interns in here  And look up their assholes  With a telescope  Instead of having a fucking conversation  Honestly  Yeah but my point is  We could have that nice conversation  With the fact that I felt like  I was dying last night  I'm sorry  You know I  I love  I care deeply about you man  I love being a father 
[02:27:30]  It's  You know  It's gonna sound  It's awesome  She was that boring  I know  That's why we move on from there  Of course you love your baby  But I fucking  I bring little stories here  You guys used to come and see my shows  Now you're a dad  And this fucking  Outlaw Josie Wells over here  He doesn't come and see me anymore  He doesn't come and see me anymore  I need  I need a fucking plug for tonight  I  That yellow eyed prick  Won't book me anymore  I will  He freaks out  If there's a slight drop off  In attendance over there  At the stress factory  Is Vinny here today?  I don't know  You don't like Vinny do you? 
[02:28:00]  I don't blame him  No  Vinny's fine  But he freaks out  He couldn't possibly be  That there's a fucking  World Series on  Or weather  Or economy  Or  Stanley Cup  Something called  The Stanley Cup's on  You got a little NBA action  I've never had less than  300 people in that room  And he always gives me  Odd nights  Wednesdays  Sundays  Always did good for him  You wanna watch  The World Series?  You know what?  Can I take one call?  Cause this is what I'm thinking  Okay  And then we'll move on  I'm really starting to think 
[02:28:30]  That it might be my fucking gallbladder  Jesus  Why?  Scott in Ohio  Scott  That's bad  I'm now using the show  To fucking diagnose myself  You let listeners diagnose you  Why do you think it's the gallbladder  If it happens every once in a while  Like this?  Cause I had the same thing  And over two years  It got  It was once in a few months  And all of a sudden  Dude I was like  Every week  It was like  Massive heart attack  The gallbladder  You get that pain  You get that pain  And it rolled around  In your abdomen 
[02:29:00]  Up into your back  And it just  You couldn't get comfortable  Oh yeah  You're describing  What I go through  Every once in a while  Dude  My dad had his gallbladder out  Around my age  Yep  After eating Kentucky fried chicken  By the way  At the beach  Nice greasy meal  And next thing you know  Beach food  What does the gallbladder do even?  What's the function of it?  You're allowed to  You can take it out and live  I think you gotta watch  Like spicy food after that  Or something  It needs to practice on  Huh?  It doesn't seem to have a real purpose 
[02:29:30]  The gallbladder  Yeah  Yeah  I'm thinking maybe gallbladder  Scott  Any other pains  I gotta be looking out for?  No you just get  You feel like you have reflux  And mine rolled up  Into my shoulder blades  Dude  You can't take a deep breath  You feel like it's a heart attack  It feels  I've never had a heart attack  Thank god  I will though  Because it's in my family history  What you do is  Eat bean sprouts  And blueberries  And you're having a gallbladder attack  I live on gyros  I'm in fucking  Healthy as an ice  So I should move to gyros 
[02:30:00]  Yeah  Mine got triggered  Mine got triggered  I ate hot wings  And that killed me right there  A week later  Greasy shit  Dawn had that too  My sister  What?  Her gallbladder  Out?  Yep  After she had a bunch of  Chinese food or some shit  Well let's get fucking Dawn  On the show  Wait  Am I heading toward  A gallbladder attack?  Are you in pain now?  Huh?  Are you in pain now?  It's finally going away  Because I went to the bathroom  A lot Otto  And the fourth shit  This morning by the way  It was a little funny 
[02:30:30]  It was a little funny  So I studied the food  That was in the funny shit  And it looked like  It was that tomato  Avocado salad  Came out undigested  That's  Not undigested  But  No there was some  There was some cilantro  In there  So I'm like  Oh the cilantro  Was part of that dish  Lava cot  I'm the type of man  Who likes to know  Who's giving him reflux  Is this guy a real doctor?

[02:31:30]  That I had any  Acid reflux  Well there probably  Wasn't as much  Stress around the household  As usually is  With a newborn  It's not that I'm stressing  It's that I'm not  Sleeping at all  It's been a month  That  I've gone a month now  Without more than  Four hours sleep  Well  Yes sir  That will be  A main cause  Of that  All right  Keep on the  Hats of reflex  You'll be doing fine  All right  Thank you  Dr. Warner  Thank you  Got the phones  I'm going to  Send you a bill  How do you know  He's a doctor  Exactly  He told us  Oh  Dr. Fibes

[02:37:00]  Unless I'm super wealthy  And I can afford a nanny  Or something  You know  No nanny for us  Oh no  I don't trust anyone  With my fucking kids  Are you going to have  A whole slew of kids  Or stop  I'm fucking  I'm fucking old  I don't  Yeah  I want to sneak  Another one in  Hopefully  Yeah  We'll see  We're worrying about  This one right now  We got Chris Mad Dog  Russo on the line  Oh good  Mad Dog  Gentlemen  Gentlemen  Gentlemen  Long time low  Listen  What's going on  Hey Chris  How are you Chris  Gentlemen  Hey guys  How you doing  No I like the other way 
[02:37:30]  Hey uh  So everyone's talking about  This perfect game thing  So obviously  We got to call  The expert  Chris Mad Dog  Russo  What's your take  On this whole thing  What's your take on it  Is I mean  Obviously  The guy  The young  Joyce  Made a terrible call  I mean  He missed it  He missed it  Terribly  You feel bad  You feel bad  For the kid  And don't forget  There's only been  20 in the history  Of the sport  There's been two  This year  I know  Isn't that amazing  We've had two perfect  Games this year already  You know what it tells you  It tells you the steroids  It tells you the amphetamines 
[02:38:00]  You can't take those  Amphetamines anymore  You know the offense  Has calmed down  And now all of a sudden  The pitching is better  Everybody's pitched great  I mean Jimenez  Is 10 and 1  Mike Pelpe  Is 8 and 1  The ERA is superb  And now as you just said  You've got three perfect games  And this is the perfect game  Stay as you want  Oh yeah  I mean the question is  How are you going to avoid this  And I've said this forever  Every other sport's got it  Football's got it  Basketball's got it  At the end of games  With the shot clock  And all those things 
[02:38:30]  The NHL looks at the goals  To make sure that the goals  Are scored  You have to figure out a way  Not balls and strikes  But you've got to figure out a way  To give the ump  To the managers  Or you have an umpire  In the booth  You have to do something  To be able to correct  These injustices  This is  We saw it last year  In the postseason  When the umpiring  Was abominable  Horrible  With calls going wrong  For both teams  All over the place  McClellan had  Two guys at third base 
[02:39:00]  Oh my god right  Remember that  They had Phil Cousy  On the left field line  On a double by the Twins  Against the Yankees  He called it foul  When it was  I mean  You have to give  That you know  Tennis has instant replay  Every sport in America  Has got a way  To figure this out  Except for baseball  And I know they want  To make the human element  An issue here  But they're going to  Have to do something  This call  The other last night  Is as bad a thing  That's the worst thing  I've ever been watching  Baseball for 40 years  I've never seen that  In all my life  The guy blows a call  Two out in the ninth  Two out in the ninth 
[02:39:30]  What about Bud Selig  Stepping in and doing something  He won't do that  Because if you do that now  You're going to open up  The Pandora's box  And you're going to have  To change calls  Left and right  Yeah but this is  This is very special  It's very rare  I understand that  We're talking about  A perfect game  Okay  How about if he does it now  And in game one  Of the playoffs  Huge game  Seasons and careers  On the line  And some umpire  Blows a call  In a big spot  That costs a team  Win  You're going to change it  He already set a precedent  Yeah you know something  I think he's got a point 
[02:40:00]  How about Bud says  Look I'm going to do it  This slow  How about no  He goes I'm going to do it  This one time  And this one time only  That works in real life  Yeah because of  Setting a precedent  I've been told that  A few times  Alright I'll allow it once  One time only  Is that excuse enough  To rob this kid  Of a perfect game  You could argue that  I don't think he'd do it  I don't think he'd do it  Because of what we just said  It didn't wreck the outcome  Of the game  And the ump said  He blew the call  And you got video  Proving that it was  It was way wrong  And not even close 
[02:40:30]  Yeah no  Listen you could  He's not going to do it  Holy shit  I thought he might  I could see a point  But he's not going to do it  I think the issue to me  Is not so much last night  Because everybody knows  Joyce blew it  And you know  I felt bad for the kid  And the Tigers  He handled it very well  By the way  The issue is not him  And not the game  Last night  The issue is  What are we going to do  In the future  To improve this umpouring  I mean there was a play  At third base  Last night  In the Tampa  Toronto game  The guy  Angel Hernandez  Caught a guy out 
[02:41:00]  Because he didn't step  On third  When he stepped on third  I mean there has to be  A mechanism  Where we can look  At some replay  Once a game  Game deciding  Situations  Give a manager  A challenge  Like they do  In the NFL  There has to be  Something done  To avoid  These kind of issues  They made a little move  With the home runs  Which is a step  In the right direction  But these umpires  Are so lousy  That something  Has to be done  And I know  Everybody wants  To give Joyce credit  Because he apologized  And all that 
[02:41:30]  Get the god damn  Call right  Stop worrying about  Thanking people  You know  I'm sorry  I blew it  Get the call right  And I'll tell you  Something else  That drives me crazy  Is that you would  Think in this situation  Joyce  It was a close  It was a bang bang play  You would think  That Joyce  Would call him out  Just to be on a safe side  Yeah that's what  I was saying  Anthony today  Right right right  Because if he gets  The single  And if he's wrong  It's you know  And he was safe  And he called him out  Alright  It was bang bang  This way  It's the worst thing 
[02:42:00]  In the world  Because you ruin history  Right  So I mean  You would think  In this spot  You would  Air on the side  Of the perfect game  It's a bang bang play  Instead of airing  On the side  Of getting a call wrong  And blowing a perfect game  And he did  Oh I'm pissed off  It's a joke  You know  Joyce  I mean  And I happen to be  Watching it live  We get it  Because I knew  The damn game  I knew who was going  I know I'm stabbling here  I saw the kid  Make the great catch  In left center  Field  Austin Jackson  Yeah 
[02:42:30]  So I'm wrapped up  In the game  And then he makes  That board  Alright  One other point  I just want to make  And we were  Discussing this  This morning  Now  The instant replay  Obviously people are  Arguing for that  And how we watch  The games now  With the great camera angles  And it's digital  And it's crystal clear  It's a no brainer  And then it makes  The point  Like in the 70s  And 80s  If there was a close call  And they try to slow down  The tape  All you see is  A smear  A smear of a ball  And you can't tell  What the fuck  Happened  You guys  I've always said 
[02:43:00]  Make sure you go to  Dallas  At the Super Bowl  I've always said  You guys are good sports guys  And you're 100% right  You know  Anthony the Yankee fan  You the Islander fan  The Mets  You're 100% right  Bottom line  In that situation  Is that with the technology  The way it has advanced today  And all these  These instruments  At our disposal  There has to be a way  Now I understand  You can't check  Every single play  And I understand  That you can't check  Every ball and strike  Because the games  Last forever as it is  Right  I get that  But why can't you 
[02:43:30]  Give the manager  A red flag  Like they do  A challenge flag  Like you do  In the NFL  And once a game  Not on home runs  Because they checked it anyway  Once a game  If he can use it  As discretion  And he can flow it out there  To have the umpire  Look at instant replay  To see if he got the call right  Yeah  And he can do it  At his disposal  And if he doesn't get it right  He lost it for the game  And if he gets it right  He keeps it  I don't know why  They can't do it  It's a simple procedure  It needs to be done  And in this case 
[02:44:00]  Last night  Leland  Would have flown the red flag  They would have challenged it  Joyce would have looked  He would have gotten  A call proper  And I'll tell you  The other thing it does  Joyce  Everybody says is a good guy  He's going to be remembered  For this call  The rest of his life  So Chris  Who would object  The umpires union  Might even be behind  Sealy changing it  Because this guy  Now would have that burden  Off of him  It would be a little  Minor blip  Who would be against him  Changing the call  I mean  If the guy's going to be  The commissioner  Then why does he just 
[02:44:30]  Take something that's wrong  And make it right  That's a good point Jimmy  You can make that argument  I don't think he's going to do it  I think he doesn't want to  Establish the precedent  If you do that  For this time  How about all the other  What do you do  Okay I'll give you an example  If you do that this time  What do you do 85  Where Don Decker  Is called first base  Which cost the Cardinals  The 85 World Series  You go back down on two  No you don't go back on  Two outs in the ninth  Bottom of  Two outs bottom nine  One nothing  St. Louis 
[02:45:00]  They're up three games  To two  He blew a call  I didn't know this  The Royals get two in the ninth  Win the game  Win the next day  13 nothing  And win a World Series  I'll tell you how  The difference is  The difference is  The difference is  That this is 100%  There's no room for debate  That if that call  Is made properly  The game is over  Without a different outcome  The same thing  Would say though  In that World Series  I think it would have been  Two out nobody on  Bottom nine  But you could always say  That a guy would have walked  Or a pitch would have been  Thrown differently  If there was somebody on  Or nobody on  Like that wasn't  The final out of the game 
[02:45:30]  I get that  And we're talking  Perfect game  That's exciting for everybody  Yeah listen  You could argue it  I don't think he's going to do it  I don't think he'll change  The precedent  You can certainly argue it  Right  I mean it's  Wow we thought  That he might just  I don't think so either  We thought he might have  Made a move today  Matt Doggy  You got me thinking  He doesn't want to set a precedent  Because then where do you  Set the line  I caught baseball last night  After this  I got a buddy there  And he said  But it's not changing the call 
[02:46:00]  Chris  I mean  He's not doing it  And I said  Yeah I understand  The precedent  He's not  So I would be shocked  Wow  Bud Sealy is worthless  He really is worthless  What about the players union  What are they  Instead of trying to protect players  From steroid investigations  What are they going to do about it  How come the players union  Isn't screaming about  One of their own being robbed  Because  The players association  And the umpire association  It's almost like  They're in  At times they work together  I think they're going to let it go  I mean  I think they're going to let it go 
[02:46:30]  I don't think  You heard Leland say last night  It's part of the game  Human element  He feels bad about it  So Leland took the high road  So did Galarraga  The pitcher  Who basically  You know  He absolved  Joyce from making the call  That players association  Is not going to do anything about it  I don't think  I think your better argument  Is  Is  Is  I don't think  Is  I don't think  He's utterly worthless  And the fact that they let this go  It's like  How could fans have any faith 
[02:47:00]  In going to these dumb events  What a crime  It really is stupid  Baseball fans are dumb  If they just keep going to games  Even with the ump  Admitting  Alright we're going around  In circles  But even with the ump admitting  It's like  What a fucking crime  I listen  I mean  Name me this sport  In any sport  Where  Tennis  It probably hasn't happened  But again  They went to instant replay  So if Bud Sealy 
[02:47:30]  Changed this call  Again  If they found out  That the umpire  Took money to make  The wrong call  Would they change it or no  That didn't happen  We're watching the clip now  Because they're playing it  Around the clock  And even the guy  That was running to first  I'm sorry  I don't know  Who it was  Okay  He was even in shock  Putting his hands  On his head  Like what  No  You got to give him  The perfect game  Right there  Again  He is not  I don't think  They're going to change it  I mean  And again 
[02:48:00]  If you're going to  Start changing it  Yeah alright  Then they really  Had a million  I mean  I  What are you going to  Tell the twins last year  Because if  Mauer's double was allowed  They would have won  That game against the Yankees  Yeah where's the  Where's the line  Where's the line  Alright this is a perfect game  Wow okay  You understand  This is history  This is big  But then  Where's the cut off point  Where it's not important enough  To not change  How about after this  You go to replay  How about this  How about you do something right  How about everyone stops  Obsessing over precedent 
[02:48:30]  And how will Bud do it  In eight months  Or five  And just do the  God damn right thing  I love Jimmy  I'm so sick and tired of it  Everybody hangs on to these  These stupid  Well what if  And what about  Yeah let's just do the right thing  They robbed the guy  Give him what he earned  I like that  I like that  Again I understand that  I understand that  I think there's two levels  Of this argument today  And I get your point  Jimmy but he's not changing it  I think to me  I think you're right actually  He won't  Yeah  He's not changing it  Alright  The most significant aspect 
[02:49:00]  Is what are we going to do  To avoid this issue  In the future  Well we gotta go  Instant replay a little bit  To me  Gotta figure it out  You gotta put some sort  Of instant replay  Yeah yeah  What would the penalty be  If you call for an instant replay  What do you mean  If you call for it  Well in other sports  There's a penalty  You lose a time out  That's what I mean  You do lose a time out  I don't know what  The penalty would be  You're right  In baseball  You have to have something  Don't you think  Well what you're doing there  If you put a penalty on it  Then you're making the manager 
[02:49:30]  Make a tough call  Well yeah  You have to decide  Which controls it obviously  So these games aren't  Eight hours long  As they  You only give them one a game  It's not the end of the world  Oh I see what you're saying  That's true  They have three in football  I see what you're saying  You get one a game  So you really want  You get one a game  And it only can be on the bases  It cannot be  Balls and shots  Now Mad Dog  You're obviously going to be  Talking about this  For most of your show today  So this will be a big one  You're right though  I gotta probably get  Seelig on  And give this some discussion  Oh you can get him on  I don't know if I can get him on 
[02:50:00]  That day of  But I'll  You'll have him on  Alright listen  We don't like tennis  So I'm not even going to acknowledge  That tennis is happening right now  Mad Dog  Loves his tennis  French Open  Who gives a crap  This tournament doesn't have  A lot of juice in it right now  Because there's no  Federer  Serena loses  But  Yeah alright  The hockey's been good  So you're into that  Flyers has been a good series  Well Flyers came back last night  So we'll see what happens  I don't think  They beat the Blackhawks though  Blackhawks are a better team  They're a real strong team 
[02:50:30]  What about the Celtics  And  A good series  And the Lakers  Very good series  I mean  Here are your themes  With it  Celtics  This is the same team  That beat the Lakers  Two years ago  They're a little older  They're not as  Spry with  Garnett  Pierce  And Ray Allen  They do have Rondo  Who's much better  Than he was two years ago  They had home court  Two years ago  This year they don't  Which is a factor  And I think the Lakers  With our test  Bynum a little healthier 
[02:51:00]  And the fact that  They want a little revenge  Kobe  I think the Lakers  Will win  So I will say  Lakers  Remember the NBA Finals  Is a different format  It's 2  3  2  It's not 2-2  1-1-1  So it's a little  It's harder for the team  Went to three home games  In a row at home  Because you can't beat  A good team  Three straight times  It's not that easy  So as a result  I will say Lakers  In six  If it was another way  Whereas 2-2  1-1-1  I'd say Lakers  In seven  So long series 
[02:51:30]  I think it's Mike  I think the Lakers  Cut him off a few times  I'll go L.A.  Mad Dog  Really fast  The 2-3-2  Has bothered me  For years  That's so  It's such a disadvantage  To have three straight games  In one city  Well I think  I think they do it  For two reasons  They started doing it  In 85  With the Lakers  And the Celtics  I think they do it  For two reasons  The first reason  Save money obviously  Well I mean  I think they  They got a better chance  To get a game six 
[02:52:00]  See if  I see  Wow  That's why you're  Doing sports talk  And that's why  We do the dick jokes  If it's 2-2-1-1-1  If it's three games  To one  You're going back  To the L.A.  For a game five  They're going to  Close out the series  You're not going to  Get a sixth game  There you go  He has an answer  For everything  And finally  Because we've got  To let you go  LeBron James  Where are we at  With that  I think he's going  To stay  I really do  I thought that way  All the way through  Wow  Sounds like he gave you  A little clue  With Larry King  Yeah  So I think he's 
[02:52:30]  Going to stay  With the cast  I have one more  Question from Mad Dog  Is there any  Possibility  Has there ever  Been a bad call  So focused on  By the entire  Country at one time  Like has any  This makes  Baseball  Looks  Jackins are in  85  The World Series  That's a terrible call  I mean  I'm watching Fox  Don't forget  85 baseball  Is a much bigger  Sport  So that call  That call  Was a World Series  Saturday night  You're talking about  A 25-28 rating  They get half that  But I will  I will answer 
[02:53:00]  Jimmy's question  Because of all  The social networking  No  This is the biggest  This is the biggest  Call  Because immediately  Everyone started  Talking about it  Setting up Facebook  Pages and  All sorts of stuff  Yeah this built up  Overnight  Like people  In seconds  Instantly said  Holy shit  What a lousy call  People had screen  Shots of the play  That did like  100,000 views  This thing blew up  Immediately  I hope Seelig realizes  I gotta work on  Getting Bud Seelig today  And you gotta work  On social networking 
[02:53:30]  It looks really bad  For baseball  It looks irrelevant  And shitty  And it looks like  They don't care about  Doing the right thing  The human element  Argument is crap  It's crap  I'm so sick of hearing  I mean even though  You're right to make it  The solution though  Is the future  So this doesn't  Happen again  I understand  The idea of  Changing it  To give the guy  His perfect game  I don't think  They're gonna do that  But the solution is  You have to use  The equipment  At your disposal 
[02:54:00]  The electronic devices  At your disposal  To try to eliminate  These egregious mistakes  We had one last night  If you gave Jim Leland  The red challenge flag  He throws it on the field  Joyce goes into the  It goes into the  Little dugout  Or wherever he has  Gotta look for the  Look for the highlight  Yep  Sees the replay  Changes his call  Guy's got his perfect game  Everybody lives happily ever after  Well going with Jimmy's point  I think after what happened  Last night  They can't ignore  The instant replay anymore 
[02:54:30]  They just can't  I think they're gonna  I think they're gonna  Have to figure something out  For next season  I think there's some truth to that  This might spur it  You know everybody  Mentioned the idea  That there was a  It's the same thing  With football  You saw what happened  With the Saints  And the Vikings  The Saints got the ball  Start of overtime  And the championship game  Unscored  Vikings never got the ball  What happened  They changed the rule  From now on  That in overtime  The other team  Both the teams  Have a chance to get the football 
[02:55:00]  Right  Both get it once  At least once  The Vikings never got a chance  To get the ball  They don't even get a shot at it  This guy  Opie's right  This kind of play  Will might spur  Now baseball is very slow to move  But this kind of play  Might spur it on  This should be given  He should be given  A perfect game with an asterisk  The same way they did it  With Maris  And the home runs  Because everybody knows  This guy got fucked  I've never seen an example  Where everybody knows  Undoubtedly 
[02:55:30]  If that call was made  I get it  They're not going to change it  Though I'd be shocked  I think you're right  But Bud Sealy's an ass  I think you proved  Your point with that  Alright Mad Dog  Thanks Chris  You know I'm a big fan  Monday through Friday  From 2 to 7  On Sirius 123  XM 144  Mad Dog Radio  Speak to you guys soon  Appreciate it  Alright Chris  Mad Dog Russo  Actually I get bummed  When he's not on  Yeah  When I miss a show  And it's somebody else  You know  I just like the way  He says Egregious  What do you think Otto? 
[02:56:00]  Did you see the play Otto?  Yeah I just saw it  I mean everybody knows  It was a  You know  Not even a question  Even the ump saying  So what does he lose?  A perfect game  Which only  He had the perfect game  The call was wrong  So what does he lose?  Being declared a perfect game  And him getting credit for it  In the history book  And now he has a one hitter  Which has happened a shitload  A million times  I can throw a one hitter  But a perfect game  It's like telling Neil Armstrong  You were never on the moon  He was on the moon  And you know  If the ump says no  Then he wasn't on the moon 
[02:56:30]  We're seeing it with our own eyes  That's a perfect game  Why is he being such a jerk?  It's obviously  The umpire admitted he was wrong too  After the game  He saw the replay  Yep  No one's arguing  Everyone said  Wow this was a horrible call  And this guy should have a perfect game  Bud Sealing's a twat  I don't think he does  What does he do?  Jimmy I really like your point  Where it's really simple  Just do the right thing  Do the right thing  And not worry about  Not worry about what this means  With other past calls  In the future  Just go look  I gotta do the right thing  How about baseball  Has been making a bunch of  Privileged cunts for a long time  I hate Bud Sealing 
[02:57:00]  I fucking hate his face  And I hate his city  What city is he from?  I hate his city  What city is he from?  Is it Milwaukee?  Alright  Milwaukee's fine  He's a cunt  Change  Just do the right thing for once  You fucking prick  That means you draw well in Milwaukee  No I've never been there  Oh you've never done that?  Never  Yeah  And Jim Leland should have  Fucking just ripped the guy's face off  He probably wanted to  They all had a lot of restraint  On that whole thing  The crowd  Everybody  He can't change  Because that could have been a riot  He can't change his call at this point 
[02:57:30]  The commissioner can now  Some people are thinking  Maybe the commissioner will say something  But I think Mad Dog had a good argument  Why he's not  He might  But I hope  Baseball just looks like a piece of shit sport  Where it doesn't matter how you perform  They have too much power  They have flight attendants  They should take some of the power away from them  I don't like flight attendants  You know how much power they have now?  If you give them any lift  They can say you're a terrorist  Oh you're getting arrested  They can have the plane turned around  Yeah  They're going to turn the plane around  You know when you  The last thing you can do 
[02:58:00]  Before you get on the plane  You give them your boarding pass  And they scan it  Yep  So the couple in front of me  Had their passports out  So I go to the guy  Do you need to see my ID?  And he went  Is this an international flight?  Aren't you flying domestic?  I went to go  Yeah alright  You fucking douchebag  You know  What are you  Getting lippy with me  But if I said that  I wouldn't have been allowed on the plane  What airline  It was continental  I've had nothing  But I'm telling you  Their reps are turning into  A bunch of real shit  Yeah  I watched the worst 
[02:58:30]  Customer service example  I've ever seen  A continental guy  They really are turning into  A bunch of cocksuckers  What did you say?  Just a guy being  Me and Kenny watched it  In Florida  Or wherever we just were  A guy was being so  No it's not Seattle  Being so condescending  To this woman  And the airline fucked up  And she was delayed  Because of them being late  And she couldn't get her bag  On the flight or some shit  But the guy was like  Wow  It was like that attitude  And he was 100% wrong  And we just watched  The way he was  And a woman actually  Said something to him  And a woman  Like well I don't want  To get involved  But  And he goes 
[02:59:00]  Well you are involved now  Real jerk off  So I fly American  Half the time now  I'm not even exclusive  To Continental anymore  That's how fucking bad they are  But you turned all of us  On to Continental  We gotta move on  To another airline  Customer service  Became such shit  When I watched him  Fuck Kenny  Out of that first class upgrade  And then treat him like shit  And not even give him  Back his old seat  I was done with exclusivity  I like the old days  Where you get a businessman  Like Larry Tate  Pinching the girls asses  In the aisle  Like those are the good old days  Hey Stu  Bring me over a double

What do you think of that?  That I'm a pain in the ass with the club? 
[03:31:00]  Yeah  Because I count chicken wings?  You count chicken wings?  You get depressed?

Yeah  Leave  I don't care for the language  That's the whole problem  When you get a clean act  Any curse at all  You get some old lady who complains  Yes, miss  All he said was cunt flaps  Anthony, we've got to go back to the Dickie Goodman  What's going on now?  E-Rock just uncovered something that I forgot all about  What is this? 
[03:32:00]  Space Hitler, hello?  Space Hitler  Did we do a Dickie Goodman's Space Hitler?  Maybe we could get this bit going again  With some of the stories in the news now  We had the listeners do their Dickie Goodman's  And we have one with Andrew Yates that your brother did  And remember Space Hitler?  Yeah, it was a big favorite of mine  Do you remember?  I just wanted Hitler in space  Like as a character  Right, so this guy did it as Dickie Goodman  Okay  This is London calling  Here is a news flash  The German radio has just announced 
[03:32:30]  That Hitler is dead  I feel like I'm there again  We're here in outer space  With a 20th century dictator  In a 21st century rocket ship  Here's Space Hitler  Space Hitler, you killed yourself near the end of World War II  How is it that you're traveling through outer space?  I don't know! 
[03:33:00]  Very interesting, Space Hitler  You are rumored to have exterminated 6 million Jews  Can you give us your reaction?  Yes, yes, yes  Very funny, Space Hitler  Is there another group of minorities you've had your sights set on  For total annihilation this time around?  What were you thinking when colored athlete Jesse Owens  Did so well in the 1936 Berlin Olympics?  This shit is bananas  Eat A-N-A-N-A-N  Here comes Benito Mussolini  Or should I call him Space Duce 
[03:33:30]  Benito, anything that you'd like to say about Space Hitler?  He's my favorite home game!  Space Hitler, how did Eva Braun take the cyanide  On that final day in the bunker?  Any thoughts on racial integration?  I know Kim to the monkey, no, no, no  That's all the time we have for today  Farewell, Space Hitler  I remember it being better  I remember it being better than that  I like Space Hitler, but I hate that  You think that was funny?  Yeah, I remember it being better than that  I don't think that was good at all 
[03:34:00]  I think the notion of Space Hitler is funny  But that was not funny  Like the idea of Space Hitler, Hitler in space  Yeah  Is good  Hitler outside of his maniacal killing is always funny  Like Hitler at a birthday party?  That's funny  Put Hitler anywhere except as the Fuhrer  Yeah  And he's just a riot  Yeah, like someone singing happy birthday to Hitler?  That's hysterical  Yeah, yeah  Looking around all kind of embarrassed  Yeah, where'd you get me?  And then he's got to make a wish and blow the candles out  And well, you know what his wish is  A lot of candles on that one little cake 
[03:34:30]  He has to exterminate the candles  Major League Baseball reviewing the safe  Call  That mad dog is going to be fucking wrong  I love the fact  They're going to turn this thing around  And they're going to figure out how to  I love how this stupid MSNBC  They have their fucking tag in front of the base  You can't see the play  They're showing the play over and over again  But their fucking crawl and logo and shit  Is in the way  The crawl should re-truck me  It's really bad shit 
[03:35:00]  Is that  But is that terrible?  Is that how fucking lousy the networks are?  It's the worst when they do golf highlights  You never see the cup  Yeah, because you never see the cup  Everything on television  Watch, here it is  Okay, watch  I know it's radio  But now here's the play  That's the final one  Safe  He just called everyone safe  Became a 9-3 Detroit loss  Game ends at 4 in the morning  Forces everyone to sit there and suffer  You want to hear the Brother Joe one?

We've only been doing it for four hours  Yeah, really  He did Andrea Yates  Andrea Yates, okay  As Dickie Goodman  All right  Brother Joe fucking hits him out  Let's see, let's see  Because we can't leave with the space hit  I know  That was kind of  That was pretty funny though  Good evening  I'm here taking a dump  In the Yates bathroom  With Andrea and her five little fuck-ups at bath time  Hey little Yateses 
[03:36:00]  What's going on here?  Splish splash  I was taking a bath  Mrs. Yates  You crazy cunt  What was that you're just whispering in your daughter's ear?  Got you in a strange world, baby  Hey little Yates girl  Where are you going in that tub of death?  Down, down, down, down, down  I'm sorry  Can you repeat that?  I couldn't hear you with all that water in your little lungs  I'm going down, down, down, down  Mrs. Yates 
[03:36:30]  We know you're nuttier than a shit after eating 25 Snickers bars  But what do you think your children are?  Three little fishies in an itty-bitty pool  Mrs. Yates  What are your children's names?  Sully, Jenny, Disco-Bubble, and Boopie-Doopie-Doop  Don't you realize they're the fruit of your loins?  Three little fishes, and the mama fishie too  Uh-oh  The little Yates boy isn't looking so good  What's that coming out of his nose?  Tiny bubble  Oh God  Andrea, I notice you're using a very gentle shampoo on their little heads 
[03:37:00]  Is that Johnson & Johnson's  Now my kids  Well, in that case, maybe you're not the worst mother in the world  Hey, little baby Yates  How did you feel as mommy squeezed the last bit of life out of your tiny defenseless body?  There is no one's afraid  I was petrified  Andrea, you kooky, homicidal twat  How come you showed less emotion through this whole ordeal than an Asian hooker?  Big girl  Well, Mrs. Yates, you've finally done it and all five of your children are dead 
[03:37:30]  What are you going to do when their dad comes home?  Celebrate the time  Come on  Let's celebrate  Thank you for allowing me to take a shit in your den of death, Mrs. Yates  Any final words before I wipe my ass and get the fuck out of here?  Well, that's it  Till next time, Dickie Goodman  With no comedy on my mind and a big fucking bullet hole in my head  I forgot he put the fucking bullet thing in it 
[03:38:00]  All right, that's not bad  See, Joe got the spirit of the bit  I like him  Yeah, it was good that we cut our losses with Space Hitler and went to that one  Very funny  What an ass  That's fucking brutal  Wow, what did you think of that one, Vinny?  That was pretty funny  That's funny and I don't want to laugh because, you know, I got five kids  Not like anyone drown them, though, come on  No, no one drown them  You think about it  You don't care  It's all across your mind  Do you need a Jimspiration today? 
[03:38:30]  Do I need a what?  A Jimspiration?  Yes, I do  I think he does  God, Jimspirations  Well, I got a  Not Jimspirational  I got a Jimspiration production piece in front of me  Oh, yeah?  Yeah  Let's hear it  Good  I'm sure they're going to like this  Do you really count the chicken wings?  I do  But you got to count them for two reasons  Are chicken wings down right now?  Chicken wings are up  They're up?  Yeah, we had Charlie Murphy last week  Good one, Jimmy  Charlie Murphy gets some meat in the wings 
[03:39:00]  Charlie Murphy drew a great crowd  And this week it's Craig Robinson  So  Oh, wow  More wings  More wings, please  You're welcome  You're welcome  That fire would make a train take a dirt road  That was  That was not good  I'm possibly drifting this way  What did you eat last night, Jimmy?  I was up shitting  I took like a bunch of shits  Or something in my system not good  Something in my system not good 
[03:39:30]  Is Charlie Murphy  Has he gotten funny?  Yeah  You know what?  The crowd likes him  Yeah, but I mean  I saw him very early on  When he was trying the stand-up thing  That was just cashing in  He was lucky  He had Bill Burr and Donnell with him  Bill Burr did the first time he came to the club  It was Charlie Burr and Donnell  And Burr went first  And the show was completely upside down  Because Burr destroyed  Donnell did okay  And Charlie was on stage  That's how it was at Caroline  Yeah  Yeah, but he got  Listen, he did well 
[03:40:00]  You know that  Oh, Christ, Norton  Jesus  Bill Burr fucking stand-up  He should have hosted  Charlie should host the show  That was stupid on his part  It was  But you know what?  He's worked hard  And he's working a lot  So  You've noticed a difference?  Yeah, he was funny as hell  He did well  Otto Tonight  Stress Factory  New Brunswick, New Jersey  Otto  Yes  That's like taking a lump of your shit  And just smearing it on the console  It really is awful  Fucking horrible  Are you a fan of farts?  Disgusting  No, not that one  Well  Stop asking me 
[03:40:30]  And I won't keep giving them to you  I heard you begging for one  Disgusting  Okay, let me ask you  How are you adjusting?  I've not talked to you  Since you had a baby  Well, you don't want to do the kid thing  It boars people  I just want to know one thing  Yeah  Are you sleeping?  No  Oh, that's great  I haven't slept in a month  That's great  I heard  I heard  C.K. tell you  Not to  To let it change you  That's the worst advice ever  Why?  You just gotta go with it  Because you're gonna become me  And the Opie and Vinny  I mean the Anthony and Vinny show  Even funny  You gotta say it yourself  Dude, the deal is  I'm an older father 
[03:41:00]  So by the time they get into those problem areas  Like you have  Fuck  What do I care?  My daughter just graduated college  $144,000  Wants to volunteer on an organic farm  I'm like, really?  Are you shitting me?  No, I'm not shitting you  Wow  Volunteer  It costs you $144,000  $144,000  I'm like, you're not fucking volunteering anywhere  I don't care if you can stop the oil leak in the Gulf  You're not doing it for free  Work  Yes  Yes, work and make money  She wants to volunteer on a farm?  She wants to volunteer on an organic farm  You know what?  College is bullshit 
[03:41:30]  And there's a movement, man  Where parents aren't gonna be sending their kids to college anymore  I wish you told me that four years ago  It's bullshit in a lot of cases  Where these kids are coming out of college  And they're already in debt  Unless they have mom and dad paying their school loans  But most of us didn't have mom and dad  Paying our school loans  So you leave college  And you're already broken in debt  And a lot of people say  Why don't we take that money  Maybe start a small business  Or something else with the money  And you'll be way ahead of all the college grads  I told you I would have bought you an organic farm  I would have bought one for you  For $144,000 in Maine 
[03:42:00]  You could have lost money directly  There's serious discussions  Happening out there  Where people are like  Why are we sending our kids to college  So they can be in debt  Or we can be in debt  $144,000 you owe Vinny  Yes, I'm aware of it  When are you gonna break even with that move?  I have to work now till I'm 79  Yeah, you're done  I'm done  Yeah, I don't sleep  But it's fine  It's weird  I'm alright with it  A lot of people like that shit  That whole food  That, you know  That's not the point  Do you know what an organic farmer does  When someone volunteers on his farm? 
[03:42:30]  He sits around the dinner table at night  Laughing with his wife  They're working for free  How's the son?  Is he still living in your backyard?  No, he  Last time we checked in with you  He was living in a car in your backyard  Pickup truck  Pickup truck, yeah  No, he's doing good  What a weird family you got  It's a weird family, man  Is he doing alright?  Yeah, he's doing real good  He's working at the club  I wanted to do stand-up  He's funny  Yeah, I like him  Yeah, he's funny too  Is he getting up on stage?  He does  But then he gets very nervous  He gets laughs and walks off  How old is he? 
[03:43:00]  23  It's the right age to start  Wow, he gets laughs and walks off  Wow, that's terrible  I know  Not the goal  He wants to join the Marine Corps  Because he doesn't want to work  And he doesn't like authority  I'm like, what the fuck is wrong?  That's the worst decision-making ever  That's a lot of taking orders and working  That's all it is  It sounds to me like you're going from bad to worse  If you do that, right?  I want to hear the gym inspiration  Yeah, we're going to play that  What's your advice for me?  New father  Give me one thing  You know what?  K gave me the best so far 
[03:43:30]  Here's my advice, honestly  Because he also said  Feel free to call your daughter a cunt  He did say that  Louie said that?  Yeah  I think that is poor advice  Louie's a very funny guy  Yeah  Quite possibly not a good dad  Give me something  Instant stripper  This is all I can tell you  Enjoy  Have fun with it  But don't be a pussy pushover  You've got to be hard  And you've got to be  Hard  Yeah, when your kids screw up  You've got to be  Don't be that father going  Oh no, not my boy  And I understand  No, you've got to be 
[03:44:00]  A fucking jerk off sometimes  You don't need friends  You have friends  You don't need friends  Vinny's had this conversation  In the mirror so many times  You were the friend, right?  I was the friend  And now I'm no longer a friend  Oh, you were the dad friend?  I was the dad friend  For a long time  That doesn't work  No  That doesn't work  Really?  Then what good is this?  You've got a little fucking playmate  You've got a little pal  No, you've got to be  The scumbag guy  I ain't doing that  Yes, you do  They have to respect you first  And then you can be friends 
[03:44:30]  When you're 93  First, they must fear you  And then why?  Then why have kids?  It's a little play thing  I would have told you  Not to do that too  No, now it's a play thing  Like, it's just little  But then once it gets old enough  To have its own mind  Then you've got to  Fuck its mind up  That's your job as a father  And a parent  Is to fuck the mind up  The second it becomes malleable  You've got to remember this, Obi  Someone said one day  Oh, look  Adolf's walking  Right  True  He pulled himself up  And then that's, you know  No thanks to the Jews 
[03:45:00]  All around the house  It was all about the Jews  Adolf's father wanted to just be  Friends with his kid  Wait, is that again?  Well, I'm going with your theory  Did Adolf's father just want to be friends with Adolf?  Probably  It was a different time  Anthony, what about you?  Come on, son  You want to kill some Jews together?  Yeah, you know  Pal  Was your dad a friend  Or a disciplinarian?  Tried to be disciplinarian  But was too much of a  Just friend kind of guy  For me to respect his discipline 
[03:45:30]  As anything but abuse  Right  It was just one of those things like  Oh, now you're going to be like  The guy that  Hey, this is  You did something wrong  I'm going to discipline you  It's like  I just watched you do  800 things wrong  In the past like  Three hours  Yeah  And now  Now you're going to be  The disciplinarian  Yeah, it's another thing  Don't discuss shit with your kids  In other words  If you say  Don't do this  Don't get into the whole  Well, I want to  Bobby's father does  It's okay  No, just no  That's it  And walk away  My wife's much better than that 
[03:46:00]  You're like  Do as I say  Not as I do  Kind of a guy, huh?  No, because I do everything right  I'm okay  Hey, shut up  Why?  Because I said so  Right  My father used to say  Whenever I'd ask for something  I'd be like  Oh, because kids do ask for dumb things  Yeah  But like  Just the dumb answer  You'd get sometimes  I once wanted to use his tools  His power tools  And I think I was seven  And obviously  No father in his right mind  Would let him do that  Let me help you  Start that chainsaw  He didn't even want me to  So he goes 
[03:46:30]  No  And I said  Why?  And he just  Didn't even look at me  He was watching TV  He goes  Don't bust my chops  Don't bust my chops  That's the right answer  Because you had a piece of wood  And a saw  And you said  You wanted to build  A cock to suck  Are you kidding?  He's like  No, you can't use my tools  And you know what I did though  I was so  Like  I wasn't listening  And as a kid  All I wanted was  To do what  You wanted to do  For that second  Which was use his tools 
[03:47:00]  So I go  I want to use the tools  And he goes  No  And I said  Why can't I use them  And he goes  Don't bust my chops  And I went  Okay  Thinking that  One of his tools  Was called a chops  And not to break it  When I used his other tools  So as I ran  For the tools  He went  No, you asshole  Don't bust my chops  I mean  Knock it off  Shut up  What more advice do you need  Do you have all  Oh, believe me  It was  Parenting  Fucking  Sixties parenting  At it's best  Yes  That was typical 
[03:47:30]  And perfect  Just cigarettes  And booze  And fucking yelling  And the strap  Every so often  And look at you  Wildly successful  Perfect  Happy human  Perfect in every way  I can't not buy a gun  Every day of the week  You're a happy human  Buying a .50 cal  He bought a .50 cal yesterday  Did you really?  It's a big day  For Anthony  Barrett  50 cal sniper rifle  Good for you  It might be somebody  Creeping around  A mile and a half  From my house  That I need to  Deal with  Vinny  Are you a gun guy?  I want a gun  I don't have a gun  I want a gun 
[03:48:00]  They're fun  They rhyme with fun  Gun fun  Why shouldn't you  Want a gun?  You definitely want a gun  And people that don't  Like guns  Or they say  Why do you have one?  I like target shooting  It's like  Why did you like  Setting off M80s?  Right  And stuff  Because they're loud  It's fun  It's like boom  Boom  It's a firework  That you can set off  In your hand  And guns have that  Ultimate authority  Yes  You just feel like a man  I have shotguns  I love it  It is  It is a level  Playing field  If  You know  There's any issues  The playing field 
[03:48:30]  Is level  I don't have to worry  That there's  It might actually be  Tilted in your favor  Place on ground  Light fuse  Get away  Yeah  Yes  My dream is just to buy  A big Montana ranch  And then sit in the center  Of a swivel chair  With a shotgun  To stay away from me  I just want everyone to wait  That's our dream too  I wanted to say that  But I just  The mic was too far to reach  You look very lazy  Today Norton  Oh Jimmy  Not at all 
[03:49:00]  Jimmy fucking killed  Getting ready  Jimmy's playing Caroline's  Oh this weekend  Tonight through Sunday  What a great time  Seeing Jimmy  It will be  Jimmy's fucking awesome  And Otto's playing  Yes  Vinny's Club  The Stress Factory  Tonight  You're over there in Jersey  Why didn't you give me  A fucking bar stool  One night  Why don't I  I never got over that  I went down for  A show  And you gave me  A bar stool  Near the waitress station  That's where you always sat  Usually you sit me  Behind that pole 
[03:49:30]  Because no one else  Wants to sit there  Uh oh  That table with the pole  Wait a minute  First of all  You know what I'm talking about  I do know exactly  What you're talking about  That's my choices  That's my choices  When I go down there  The table where I can fit  Two of my friends  Three of my friends  With a pole right in the middle  Yeah but no  Or the waitress area  But I never want  Because if you sit  In the middle of the crowd  And people see you  Then you're not going to be  Left alone  These are just jokes  Vinny takes care of it  Comedy club tables  Are notoriously small  Though anyway  Ah they are tiny  You sit there  Especially when you  Try to get some food 
[03:50:00]  And your drinks  Are all falling over the edges  I'm a fan of the back wall  You sit next to people  You don't know  And don't like  Just balance this on your lap  Nothing worse than  Sitting by somebody  That is like heckling  And being an asshole  And the comic thinking  You're with them  I would think comics  Would know that  Comedy clubs  Place people next to each other  That don't know each other  So don't jump all over  Someone else's shit  Because I had that happen  At the cellar  That time with Dave Attell  Which we've talked about  And I love it  Dave  I think he's hysterically funny  But some fucking bitches 
[03:50:30]  Were yapping during his show  And  Well you and your friends  Were talking right  He turned  No  I wasn't with them  He turns to the table  And starts bitching us all out  And I looked and I was like  I threw my hands up  Like hey I'm not with them  I didn't say a word  I just went like that  And he goes  Don't even start with that shit  I saw you open your fucking mouth  And then I had to talk back  Going look  I'm not talking 
[03:51:00]  I'm not with these people  And then I was the asshole  That he's yelling at  But he fucking dragged it out of me  You were just  You were just  You know who you were  No  Not at the time  He didn't have a clue  We called him on it though  But he was being typical  Of Dave Attell  Yes  Scumbag  Love Attell  Dave's fucking funny as hell  Can't get him on the show  It's tough to get him on the show  He does it from time  And I shot with him  The night at the cellar  Come and get his ass in here  Yeah I know  He's great  Oh it's funny  We were out with him  One night after hours  At like 3 in the morning  And there were two guys  Worked their way into the bar 
[03:51:30]  Just these two weirdo dudes  And it tells them  They're drinking a beer  Minding his own business  And a guy just reaches over  And grabs Dave's balls  So I'm like  What the fuck  What the fuck is that about  So we push the guy away  And this is the guy's defense  Oh I watch Insomniac  That was his hole  Oh good  Yeah so I could grab your balls  Oh I'm a definite  He must have been hammered  The guy was an idiot  You don't want to wake up  After that drunk  And think  What did I do  I think I grabbed  Dave Attell's balls last night  How do you tell the story 
[03:52:00]  They're gushier than you'd think  How do they feel  Jilly  Yeah certain things  You don't want to remember  From a binge night  No  And now it's even worse  Because  With texting and stuff  You ever look back  At your drunk texts  From the night before  Oof  It's awful  It's so gay texting  There's a fucking record  Of what you were saying  To people  Yeah  It's like it used to be  You'd just see them at a bar  And you'd say something stupid 
[03:52:30]  And then you remember  You kind of vaguely remember  The next day  What you said to a girl  Or something  And now you have  This complete record  Of your whole exchange  With everyone you know  Drunk  You can't even alter it  The next day  No I didn't say that  It was loud in there  Sometimes you read  Two of them  And just delete all of them  Without looking at the rest  I don't even want to know  What I said  You missed what Otto said though  What happened  He doesn't like the texting  You don't like texting  No I mean  I don't like talking on the phone  Especially when somebody  Texts me a joke  Because you don't get
