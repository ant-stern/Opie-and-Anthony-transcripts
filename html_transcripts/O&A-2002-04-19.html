<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about child actors, specifically focusing on Jackie Coogan, the "Our Gang" comedies, and Robert Blake. This segued into a surprisingly detailed discussion of Opie's brother, Joe, who fronts a Journey tribute band called Evolution.  The hosts played several recordings of the band, highlighting their surprisingly high quality, before connecting Joe via phone.  Joe discussed the band's success, the lucrative nature of the tribute band business, and the band's members. This led to a humorous tangent on the many creatively (and bizarrely) named tribute bands found online, such as "Floydian Slip," "Pink Freud," and various Black Sabbath tributes, culminating in a mention of an Aaron Carter tribute band with audience "hair-tussling."

Next, a female guest and her male companion joined the show in studio to promote a DVD of movie fight scenes.  The conversation covered martial arts, fighting techniques, and anecdotes from the guest's experience as a fight choreographer, including working with Charlie Sheen. This segment was punctuated by sexually suggestive remarks and playful banter between the guest and the hosts.  The show then returned to darker topics, revisiting Robert Blake's arrest for his wife's murder, comparing it to the O.J. Simpson trial, and discussing the troubled lives and often tragic fates of several "Our Gang" child actors.  This segment concluded with a phone call from Linda Blair, during which the hosts repeatedly shouted "The power of Christ compels you!"

The show continued with more rambling conversation about child actors, transitioning into explicit descriptions of celebrities Bonnie Raitt and Jennifer Lopez.  The hosts then revealed that their correspondent, Big Kev, had been ejected from the Chiller Theater Convention after they repeatedly yelled "The power of Christ compels you!" at Linda Blair during a previous phone interview.  They also lamented missed opportunities to interview Adam West and Bob May (ALF).

Devin Ratray, the actor who played Buzz in "Home Alone," then called in. A significant portion of the segment focused on Devin's revelation that his father, Peter Rattray, starred in the softcore pornographic film "Young Lady Chatterley," prompting much ribald discussion and jokes.  Devin's acting career and other film roles were also discussed.

The latter half of the show featured a "Gangster Game," where two female callers, Lady Di and Marion, acted out scenes from gangster films for the hosts and Devin to guess. The game was frequently disrupted by arguments and profanity from Lady Di and Marion, despite repeated warnings from the hosts, who struggled to maintain control. The show ended with the continued "Gangster Game" and further listener participation.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show, 1027-WNW.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, we were talking about Brother Joe. 
[00:00:30]  He's in a tribute band, Anthony.  Yes, he's in a tribute band.  Let me tell you something.  I've got to be honest.  I was ready to start really goofing on your brother.  Of course.  And I just heard some of the songs they have done.  You thought you popped in the CD.  Yes.  The real band's CD.  Yes, it's unbelievable.  Yeah.  It really is unbelievable.  By the way, shameless plug.  June 1st, when we're doing our softball game, that night at Mulcahy's, they're going 
[00:01:00]  to be playing this tribute band my brother is in, which we will get to the name and the  band and everything.  Well, there he is.  Joe.  Hey, Joe, you there?  Hey, fellas.  Hey, man.  What's going on?  How are things going with the band?  Very well.  Very well, indeed.  Yeah.  Yeah, you go.  You go.  You go.  You go.  Yes, formerly of Open Skies and Valentine.  That's right.  And he's the lead singer.  And he looks just like Steve Perry of Journey. 
[00:01:30]  It is indeed Evolution, a Journey tribute band.  My brother in a Journey tribute band.  Thank God.  You want me to step even lower?  Well, I'm playing bass in a Journey tribute band.  Thank God you guys didn't come up with a cheesy name for the band, though.  Oh, my God.  Because we're on a website here, and some of the names of these tribute bands are ridiculous.  Yeah, don't give out the name of the website or it'll freeze up.  But it's a website that's dedicated to tribute bands and going to their websites and booking them. 
[00:02:00]  There's a bunch of Pink Floyd tribute bands.  The Final Cut, Eclipse, The Machine plays Pink Floyd, In the Flesh, Bricks in the Wall, Beyond Darkness.  But then there's ones that try to play on the name themselves.  Floydian Slip.  Pink Freud.  What are they, Asians?  One of the worst ones I saw, one of the worst rip-offs I saw on that site, was a Van Halen tribute band that call themselves VH, and they use the logo. 
[00:02:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Some of the people have...  They just put the logo right up there.  Like people think it's really going to be...  Yeah, right.  I don't understand some of the people that would make a tribute band out of Mike and the Mechanics.  Why is there a Mike and the Mechanics tribute band?  Because there's a tribute band to Aaron Carter.  Aaron...  Little Aaron Carter.  Little Aaron Carter.  And at the end of the show, you get to tussle his hair.  Little tussle. 
[00:03:00]  You could probably book the real Mike and the Mechanics for just as cheap.  Exactly.  Cheaper.  Pat Benatar.  Poison.  Of course, the hair bands.  Very popular.  A ton of hair bands.  Yeah.  Black Black Sabbath.  What are you kidding?  It should only be Sabbath Cadaver.  The rest of them plug in.  How do you know?  I'm telling you, because I know.  Let me pop it up.  I'll run you through some of the names of some of the Sabbath.  After Forever.  Sabra Cadabra.  Exactly.  Thank you.  NIB.  After Cadabra.  Psycho Shade. 
[00:03:30]  Slack Sabbath.  Ugh.  Exactly.  Dornigopia.  Forever Black.  War Pigs.  Heaven and Hell.  Masters of Reality.  Black Sunday.  Of course.  I've never heard of any of them.  Sweet Leaf.  I think one of the best names I heard was for an ABBA tribute band called Bjorn Again.  There's an Austin Powers tribute band.  Oh, my God.  Interesting.  What about the Peat Loaf?  Oh, yeah.  Meat Loaf.  There's a band called Peat Loaf.  And then there's Meat Loaf and Cher, the ultimate tribute. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, right.  They do Meat Loaf and Cher.  Christina Aguilera.  Just a couple of skinny blondes trying to be her.  Brittany.  But Joe?  There's a Meat Loaf tribute band called Pot Roast, too.  Pot Roast.  There's a God Smack tribute band.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, it's blowing up huge, though.  You know that.  It's called Dog Smack.  Especially, like, the 80s bands that just don't tour anymore. 
[00:04:30]  Well, I can tell you, tell me if I'm right.  Your audience, a lot of chicks in spandex pants they should probably not be wearing anymore.  Right.  Absolutely.  And 80s clothing, 80s hair, trying to relive a little piece of their lives there.  But you know what the deal is?  You're right.  A lot of chicks, a lot of girls come down to see this thing.  And where the girls go, the guys follow, it doesn't matter.  Because if the girls are fat, then the fat guys will come down.  All their money is green. 
[00:05:00]  It makes no difference.  Exactly.  These tribute bands, if they're done well, make fortunes.  It's ridiculous.  Cruise ships and huge venues.  You guys getting a lot of bookings there, Joe?  Oh, yeah.  It's blowing up.  It's insane.  I've been writing my own music, playing in all kinds of cover bands for years.  This will be the most lucrative band I've ever played.  See?  See how ridiculous the industry is?  In fact, it's so lucrative that that's why I didn't call in for a little while. 
[00:05:30]  I was downstairs working on yet another tribute band, a U2 tribute band with Laird.  With Jim Laird, singer.  Yeah.  Who does sort of resemble a very chubby Bono right now.  He'll be.  Well, get him on a treadmill.  He'll be all right.  We've got to get him on a treadmill, get him to dye his hair black and calm down his attitude a bit.  And he's just fine.  He sounds great.  I want to, let's play a little bit.  This is Joe and Evolution.  Who else is in the band?  Give him a plug, Joe. 
[00:06:00]  John Capadona, drummer from the original Journey thing that we had going on years ago when he used to sing harmonies behind stage and stuff.  Yeah.  And then we have Lance Millard playing keyboards and Eddie Jelly.  Yes.  Playing guitar.  Cool, man.  Here's a...  Listen to this and...  He did a punch, that's all.  Don't tell me that this doesn't sound just like friggin' listening to Journey live.  It's amazing.  And it was live.  It was recorded completely live.  Yeah.  It's the band Evolution.  Yeah.  The Journey tribute band. 
[00:06:30]  With my brother.  With brother Joe.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Now listen to this part.  You're a dick.  Listen to the harmonies, man.  The harmonies.  That's what Journey was all about.  Check it out.  I know I ought to you.  Cause I...  See?  He can hit those notes.  I know I'm alive.  I've got all this up to you. 
[00:07:00]  See?  And there's Joe on the bass.  Joe on the bass.  Nice, Joe.  Nice.  Joe's slapping away.  A couple of breaks.  You're waiting for some more.  There's Hugo.  There's Hugo.  You are horrible.  Wow.  And you felt the magic on the sea.  Joe's taking a high part here.  Dumb, Dumb, Ember.  Dumb, Dumb, Ember.  This, by the way, is my favorite song. 
[00:07:30]  I want to sing.  Here, just remember.  Listen, listen.  Just remember.

[00:13:30]  Smart air.  What a dick.  I'm going to crown you, Jim.  That's great.  That's really impressive, Joe.  Cool.  Thanks, guys.  Unbelievable.  Larry's saying that was really Journey, you liars.  No.  No.  No.  We did record that completely live in a rehearsal studio.  And that was like after maybe three or four rehearsals.  We're about 12 rehearsals deep now.  That's pretty good.  We have pretty much like the entire best of catalog of Journey done. 
[00:14:00]  And like I said, I'm working on that YouTube thing with Jim.  Money, money, money.  Opie, Opie, Jim wants to know if your brothers are in an REO Speedwagon cover band.  Because there's been a rumor that Opie's brothers are...  No?  Okay.  Just wondering.  Well, yeah, if you want to catch that, when?  June 1st?  June 1st, yeah.  We'll be playing at a place up in Cortland on May 4th.  That's our first gig.  But the first one out on the island is going to be June 1st.  The Mulcahy's?  The Mulcahy's thing. 
[00:14:30]  You're coming down to that one, right?  Yeah, it's after the softball game.  Cool.  Nice.  All right, man.  Hey, is Open Arms on this CD?  What's that?  Do you do Open Arms?  Yes, actually we do.  I like that one a lot.  Is it on that CD?  No, it's not on that CD.  No, we only recorded like four or five tunes.  Yeah, just a little taste of a few Journey songs here.  Yeah.  Let me see.  Amp, you know where I'm going tonight?  Hold on.  Love is the fire.  Wonder all does it sound. 
[00:15:00]  Wonder who's crying out.  That's unbelievable.  We keep playing that.  Our female numbers will go through the roof.  We need female numbers.  Yeah, right.  Hey, do you guys cover the Patty Duke theme?  Nice.  Jeff wants to know online.  I'm loving there.  Okay.  I'm going down too much.  Here's Joe and he's in the Journey band.  A bass guitar is in his hand. 
[00:15:30]  It's good to see you can still write a parody, Ant.  Oh!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  On the spot.  All right.  I'm running down to...  I'm going to Don Hills tonight.  Yeah.  Down in the village.  It's Greenish and...  Sacky.  Yeah, downtown to see Bitch Slap.  Uh-huh.  Who is...  Another tribute band?  The guitar player from the Letterman band.  Oh, yeah.  Joe's like hooking up with her or something.  I don't know what the hell the story is there.  I've got to get the behind the scenes on this one.  Are you...  Very, very cool. 
[00:16:00]  Very cool chick.  Are you banging the chick from the Letterman band?  No.  No, that's not happening.  From David Letterman's band.  You've become very friendly with her though.  Yeah, you know, I mean, she hung out, you know, the entire Bar 9 gig last Tuesday.  Yeah.  Let me ask this, Joe.  Would you like to bang the chick from the Dave Letterman band?  Oh, absolutely.  I love it.  It works.  See what happens.  There's two ways about that.  I will be completely honest.  I'm as free as a bird.  All right.  See what happens.  All right, brother.  Yeah, she's at Don Hills tonight with a band Bitch Slap and there's a whole bunch of  people jamming. 
[00:16:30]  I'm bringing my axe down.  It should be fun.  Cool, man.  Have fun, bro.  Gentlemen, thank you very much.  I'll talk to you guys soon, right?  All right.  Thank you.  Joe.  That's pretty cool, man.  I mean, you know something?  Believe me.  Believe me, Journey ain't a lot of people's cup of tea, you know?  But if you listen to it, it's amazing that you can put together a band and sound that  much like the real thing.  I didn't like Journey when I was growing up.  I was like, ah, they're homos.  But, you know, I get a little older, I'm like, no, I dig it now. 
[00:17:00]  I really dig.  I'm mellowed.  I don't want to like him either, but I do.  It bugs me.  Do you shed a tear as you're listening to Journey in your apartment all alone?  No, I put on open arms.  I just...  No, I don't, actually.  I hear Steve Perry is actually in a Rotgut cover band now.  Is that true?  Didn't they just get back together, Journey?  Oh, who knows?  I think they got a different singer, though.  Oh.  Yeah, they got a different singer.  Yeah.  All right.  They were looking for singers.  They actually called up Hugo from this band and wanted him to sing. 
[00:17:30]  And he said no, because he was still kind of working on his own stuff at that point.  Now he's kicking himself, right?  Eh.  Eh.  You know, what are you going to do?  A little bit.  Who knows?  He could have been in Journey.  Well, no, the real Journey's doing just fine with the new singer I'm hearing.  Yeah.  Kid Rock won't be there because he'll be singing Government Mule.  All right, we have to take a break.  Are the retarded Laverne Shirley here yet?  Not yet, but they're on the way.  They better be.  All right, we got a brand new game we're going to debut tonight.  It's the Gangster Game with the retarded Laverne Shirley for some fine prizes. 
[00:18:00]  And also some chick out there wants to beat the crap out of us.  There's a girl out there.  There's two women out there.  They're really, I don't know, they're here for some fights.  They're really attractive.  They'll flip you.  I don't want to be flipped.  I'm not into that.  No.  It just does nothing for me, but they're both beautiful.  Also, look, Devin's here.  Remember Devin?  Yes.  Buzz from Home Alone.  He was the older brother from Home Alone.  He's a good friend of ours.  Macaulay Culkin's older brother from the Home Alone movie.  We saw him staggering around the Jim Norton show last night. 
[00:18:30]  We're like, hey, why don't you come by and say hi.  Jim Norton fan.  It would have been a long time since I'd seen Devin.  I was happy that he was able to cover us.  We'll talk to Devin next as well.  With alcoholism.  Maybe we'll have the hot chick flip the kid from Home Alone.  Oh, yeah.  He's not a kid anymore, though.  No.  Boy, she's sexy.  Yeah, we'll have her in next.  Some days, you know, we're a laugh riot and other days we just flat out suck.  We know it.  Interesting and true.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:19:00]  You give the hummus to Fez.  I don't want your dirty hummus.  Ron and Fez.  Weeknight at 7 after Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  WNEW.  Ready and now.  Ha ha.  Here comes the boys on the side.  Here comes the.  Ready and now.  Ha ha.  And how you like me now, I say boom.  Here comes the.  Boom.  Ready and now.  Here comes the boys on the side.  Boom.  Here comes the.  Boom.  Here comes the.  P.O.D.  Boom. 
[00:19:30]  Little news for Boston.  P.O.D.  Playing the River Rave this summer.  Can't wait to check out P.O.D. up there in Boston, Ant.  Oh, yeah.  River Rave lineup for Boston.  Outkast.  P.O.D.  Papa Roach.  The Strokes.  Our Lady Peace.  Yeah.  Old friends of ours.  You remember them.  Sure.  From the day, Anthony.  Jimmy.  Jimmy World.  Drowning Pool.  And the list goes on and on and on. 
[00:20:00]  Nice.  And I think Mr. Oedipus has a few tricks up his sleeve still.  Oh, yeah.  You know how that works with him right in.  Hell, yeah.  Just when he thought the lineup couldn't get any better.  He pulled something out of this, you know what.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Ha ha.  Hello.  The Retard of the Bird and Shirley making their way up to the studio.  How are ya?  We're going to be playing the gangsta game with Lady Diane Marion in a little while. 
[00:20:30]  Yes.  On paper, sounds like it's going to be hilarious.  Hopefully they can pull off their parts.  Someone's sending us a picture of Voss on golf.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha.  Voss's head on Dorf's body.  Yeah, if you're just tuning in, our friend Rich Voss, we're convinced that he is the world's tallest dwarf.  Dwarf.  O.P. seemed to realize last night he has very short fingers.  Very short fingers. 
[00:21:00]  And he's got short legs and a long torso.  And smelly ears.  Ha.  Is that something about dwarfs?  I think so, yeah.  All right, let's get the chick in here before she decides to beat the crap out of all of us.  I love her.  She is beyond hot.  It bugs me.  And she could kill you.  Kill you.  She's here with another guy to promote ultimate fights from the movies.  Yeah.  Just ass kicking.  It's kind of like the one we did with Freddy Krueger there. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  All the scariest parts of movies.  Right.  Of horror movies.  This is fights from movies.  Some of the best fights.  Yeah, you got fights from such movies as Fight Club.  Oh, wow, I was just distracted.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Hi.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey.  Hi.  Hey.  Hey.  So you can kick some ass, huh?  Yeah.  Wow. 
[00:22:00]  My God.  I don't know what to say.  I'm just looking right at your cleavage.  Yeah.  I am just staring away at it.  That's obviously the distraction.  Wow.  And then she kicks your ass, Anthony.  Right.  You're too busy looking at the cleavage.  Next thing you know, your knees are out.  She smells really good.  Really?  Yeah.  I got to warn you, he's the pervert in the room.  Yeah, you got to watch out for her.  There's five black belts in here.  You sit me next to the pervert?  And we're not even kidding and doing a cute little radio thing. 
[00:22:30]  Make sure his hands are above the table.  Okay.  At all times.  I wouldn't even.  You could probably just kick him right away.  I brought.  Right there, right?  Just kick him in the head.  I brought an ultimate fight weapon.  Do not play.  It's a blow up one though, right?  Yeah.  Hit him in the head with it.  Boy, there's other places you could put him.  You didn't say which head.  I brought that.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah.  All right.  So tell us about the DVD.  It looks like it's a kick-ass DVD.  I haven't checked it out myself yet, but I did.  Very cool. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah?  Good fights.  Good fights.  I like that.  A lot of the martial arts in there.  From the original Blade, that's one of my favorites.  We've got to go out on a limb and say this guy knows martial arts.  That's a pretty good bet.  I like the Jackie Chan fights that are in this.  Yeah.  Very funny Jackie Chan.  Very good fighter.  And it's just a pisser to watch him.  I love when he does his stuff with the chairs and ladders.  I don't get it.  I just look like he'd be kicking my ass.  I'm no fighter.  Opie's the fighter. 
[00:23:30]  He beat up a French guy yesterday right here in the studio.  It was a lot of fun too.  He didn't use any martial arts technique.  He used a martial amp.  Yeah.  That's the only martial that was used as he put Frenchy's head through it.  Let me ask the expert.  Is it a good move to have your knee in the guy's throat with his whole head tilted sideways like this?  On the ground.  On the ground?  Up against an amp?  That's probably one of my favorite moves.  Yeah.  Wow.  He stops talking really fast.  Oh yeah, he did.  Do you teach people to fight in movies? 
[00:24:00]  Is that what you do?  I think that's part of my job on this DVD.  Yeah.  That we have a commentary that I do over the fights so you learn all the facts and stuff  about stunts and stunt fighting.  Learn how to kick your friend in the head.  Yeah.  And then there's a little featurette in there that we actually show step by step how to  do your own fighting.  Uh oh.  Get a digital video camera and you can shoot your own fights.  Like fake fighting?  Well, same fighting.  Yeah.  But we like the real thing in here.  I was trying to tell him during commercials.  I don't think he believes us. 
[00:24:30]  No, it was a real fight in here yesterday.  We do fight club in here.  We've had about four or five of them over the years.  Whenever there's a disagreement or something, people are getting under each other's nerves,  it just breaks into a spontaneous brawl.  And that's how we solve problems here.  What needs to happen is you all need to tape that and then maybe you'll be on like the  ultimate fight too.  Oh, ultimate radio fight.  Right.  I think it ought to work.  You know, we're trying to brag, but we would look like a bunch of pussies.  Oh, I know.  Forget about it.  Hey.  We're not that impressive when we fight. 
[00:25:00]  How long have you been a martial artist?  I'm sorry.  Probably like over 25 years or so.  Really?  Some severe ass kicking.  Stop with your personal likes and dislikes, Norton.  What's the worst thing you ever did to a guy or a girl?  Oh, I get the worst thing.  Did you ever get into a real fight and just destroy them?  Oh, way back in junior high school.  Really?  That's part of learning the martial arts.  So you learn to fight so you don't fight.  See, I don't like that part of the martial arts. 
[00:25:30]  I know.  It always seems the most advanced people in martial arts, the most advanced, whether it's  in the movies or you see it in TV shows, it's like the better they get, the less they  want to fight and the less they even have to fight.  It's like, no, I want to learn this so I can just go back and beat people up.  But see, then, aren't you considered like a deadly weapon at some point and so you have  to have like some type of license or something?  That's why you can't really fight.  Speaking of deadly weapons.  A license.  A driver's license.  That's pretty deadly.  So you can drive over people. 
[00:26:00]  The actual thing.  Deadly weapons.  That's the beautiful.  Hey, I'm not blonde.  No, you got some deadly weapons.  You don't have to be blonde to have deadly weapons.  I was only blonde in the movies.  You do some ass kicking.  You do some ass kicking.  Are you a martial artist too?  Yeah.  No.  I'm a different type of artist.  Yeah.  So hot.  Well, she was in Players Club.  Right.  She was right on the cover of the DVD.  Oh, yeah.  The girl fight. 
[00:26:30]  The girl fight.  The chick fight.  That was good.  I loved the cat fighting.  Did you do any of the cat fighting?  Mm-hmm.  With the scratching and stuff?  Were you the one that threw the girl into the mirror or did you get thrown into it?  I got thrown into the mirror.  You got thrown into the mirror.  That was pretty good.  Yeah.  She gets heaved right into the mirror.  She hurt that mirror pretty bad.  Yeah.  I did.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  So why don't you help us out with some of the movies that we can see in the DVD?  Well, some scenes from the movies.  Fantastic movies from Jackie Chan, Rumble in the Bronx.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that's a good one.  There's something from Gladiator, Snatch, Brad Pitt, kicking butt. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, that was a good fight scene too.  Jet Li is also in there.  Two of his movies.  I see Pacino.  Is this Scarface?  Yeah.  He brings his little friend.  Yeah, that's the scene at the end where they're all coming up the stairs after him.  That's a great scene.  You're in there on Time Cop, right?  Yeah, Time Cop.  There's a little scene in this movie with me and Jean-Claude Van Damme.  Oh, that was you?  A little knife fight.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Okay.  Bravo.  I like that movie. 
[00:27:30]  Did he kick his ass?  No, it wasn't in the script, you know?  Jean-Claude wins.  But in real life, you can kick his ass, right?  What do you think in real life?  We all know.  He's a great athlete.  Look at you.  Always the diplomat.  He can split.  He's got a good butt in the shot.  I'll say.  Oh, there it is.  I knew you were going to like that one.  Someone was telling me that you have a good story as far as a fight with Charlie Sheen.  Oh, that's a movie I did with him.  Hot Shots Part Deux.  Oh, Part Deux.  I remember that.  Was that the one that was nominated or was it the first one? 
[00:28:00]  Oh.  It's smart ass.  They got honorable mention, you know.  So you beat him up?  Yeah.  It's a spoof on the Rambo III series.  Right.  And part of the gag, at the very end, I get kneed in the, whatchacomacallits.  Right.  We call it a yambag.  Yeah, yeah.  The mule.  So they wanted me to spit out two prunes.  Oh.  Yes.  So we did it.  And they, they soaked them in water.  And when I spit it out, the second one came out with this long vein looking thing sticking 
[00:28:30]  in.  So the director said, oh no, we can't do that.  Why not?  That's funny.  They changed it to two big walnuts, which if you ever try to put two in your mouth.  Oh, just ask Jimmy Norton.  Oh, he knows.  You never get your money back either.  And then we laughed.  And then we laughed.  But the director threatened me in the beginning and said, if you don't do a good job on this  scene, I'll give you two little raisins to spit out.  Oh, no.  Oh, my.  You fight a little better than your humorous anecdotes, right? 
[00:29:00]  Oh.  Now he's going to kick my ass.  You're a brave man.  I'm teasing.  You never did a radio fight before.  I'm teasing, of course.  I picked on a weak Frenchman, and you're picking on Mr. Martial Arts guy.  I am teasing, of course.  I am a big fan of his scene there.  I assume if you wrestle him, it's not like wrestling a veal like I did yesterday.  No, no.  It wouldn't even take two seconds.  What do you do now?  Somebody, like you say, you don't want to fight or anything.  You're into the martial arts. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, you're hanging out.  Somebody gives you some crap.  Do you try to close it immediately and disable the guy and just kill him?  Just kill him, or do you work some of that smooth scripture stuff on him, shut him up,  and drive him away?  How do you handle it?  Well, you have to go to the point that if there's no other way out, then you have to  take care of it.  So some guy comes up to you, he's like, hey, mother effer, you're in a bar or whatever,  and he's like, come on, we're going to go.  You think you're a tough guy?  What do you do?  Well, first you see if you can get out of it, but if you can't, you definitely have 
[00:30:00]  to be the one that throws the first blow.  Do you do the first punch and get it over with like that?  Hit hard, hit first, you know, you've got to go first.  Where would you hit a big, you say a big guy, like some guy maybe works out at the gym,  he's got a big upper body and stuff, standing right in front of you, getting right in your  face.  How do you, what's your move there?  What do you do?  He picks up his cell phone and he calls me.  Yeah.  That's my big move.  I'm telling you.  That's called a one-two punch.  Tell him.  What do you do? 
[00:30:30]  Do you hit him in the throat?  Some guys can take a throat hit fairly well, but they can't take, if you jam their nose.  Yeah.  The flat of the palm into the nose, that's a good one.  But we've all heard that could kill a man, right?  I don't think it can.  I think that's a good one.  Did he go up?  Yeah, it could.  Because the bone could drive it into his brain.  You could do it if you do it with a bullet.  You put the gun up to his nose and pull the trigger, I hear that could be fatal.  But the palm of the hand, can you drive it up into his brain or something?  If you hit it hard enough, yes.  Why wouldn't you?  But also, you know, not only that, he'll get his vision completely blown. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, yeah.  Then you go to work.  And then what do you do?  Get Paul Christo.  I just picked you just, you just hop back and go.  She's the clean of that.  Do you, like, make some scary sound that gets everybody to run away?  Actually, that's a good, kind of like a good way to get his attention away from you.  Yeah.  When you practice that, it comes in handy.  Because some of the screams and faces Bruce Lee used to make, I would think he was trying  to trick people to make them think he's retarded.  And then he just kicks their ass.  And his neck would go, remember that? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Guy was great.  Guy was great.  Great fights.  Do you live in Los Angeles, Chris Cole?  No, I live in Atlanta.  Oh, okay.  You're supposed to be, too.  Yeah.  Hey, we talk about Freak Nick all the time on our show.  You ever get out on the highway during Freak Nick, do that booty dance?  You know what?  I used to.  That Freak Nick scares us white boys.  I'll tell you.  Let me tell you.  It scares me, too.  Oh, really?  All right.  We're not alone, then.  We were down there, interviewing for a radio show, and the locals warned us to get out 
[00:32:00]  of town.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  What is it?  It gets wild.  It gets wild.  It's like a spring break.  Wow.  To be polite, it's a black version of spring break, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's great.  All the black colleges go to Atlanta and whoop it up.  But look.  No, but you know what?  And when we say whoop it up, I mean, they get on the highway.  They stop traffic on six, seven lane highways.  No, what happened?  Start cranking the tunes and doing that booty dance.  And dancing.  Doing a booty dance.  Yeah.  But now college students don't go.  That's what happened with it.  They used to be, you know, it used to be fun.  Oh, now it's just people going to party, right? 
[00:32:30]  Now it's just people coming to party.  Like you have like pimps coming to recruit.  Yeah.  To recruit people.  Oh, scouting out for some new bitches.  It got kind of weird.  Exactly.  I got to scout for some new bitches.  Exactly.  So we were like, oh no, this is a funny move.  Yeah.  Are you married?  I'm engaged.  Oh, congratulations.  Thanks.  Like you have a shot, Norton.  Stop it.  Just stop it.  You never know.  He had a big show last night.  He's feeling good about himself.  I was eyeing him over here.  Yeah.  I had a good shot. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  We took in the freak Nick.  Yeah.  As they're boarding up their front windows.  I don't know.  They did.  I know.  But you know.  People having fun.  Why not?  It's kind of crazy though.  You don't know how to kick a little ass.  Yeah.  That's about it.  You can handle yourself, right?  Yeah.  I can handle myself.  What do you do?  Are you just an actress or do you fight?  You know what?  I actually produce and write as well.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Who taught you to fight in that?  In the movie?  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  I had a stunt guy come in and like someone come in and train me to do it but we kind of  didn't do it by the rules.  Really?  Yeah.  You threw a mirror.  What?  We were kind of irritated with each other.  Yeah.  Me and the other girl in the fight.  So it was kind of real.  Except I wouldn't have got my ass kicked.  Well you've been the moment.  Cube came in a few times like cut.  She's supposed to win the fight.  Not you.  Yeah.  Is she jealous of you?  That's why she didn't like you.  She was probably jealous of you. 
[00:34:00]  Oh yeah.  I think that's it.  So if another girl is coming at you, what's your first move?  My first move?  Try to rip off their top?  No.  Make a dream.  Let's see.  What have I done to somebody?  Usually, I'm with James.  I hit first and I hit hard.  Yeah.  You know, if they start screaming at me, I'm like, I'm not going to argue with you but  I will hit you.  I'm not going to warn them.  That seems to be the best strategy.  Yeah, it is.  Just strike them fast, hard and then hopefully you can just walk away.  Yeah.  Like Kane.  Like Kane from Kung Fu just walks away from the situation. 
[00:34:30]  He would kick major ass.  Leave them all laying there and they'd be like a little groggy.  You'd think he could go back and just take them all out.  But then he walks away so that later on they could hunt him down and that'd be a great  fight at the end of the show.  Of course.  Don't want to blow the load early.  He talks funny though.  Yes, he did.  I didn't understand that.  And he's Carradine.  I don't know.  I never got the show anymore.  There's something so funny.  Yeah.  Because the feature on the Ultimate Fight DVD that James does when he walks you through  like the fighting. 
[00:35:00]  It's supposed to be just for fun but like I'm using those moves on people that I don't  like.  Can I try to move out on you?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  See, I don't like the people that try moves out.  We got a friend of the show, Norris, Gorilla Boy.  Jeff Norris.  Jeff Norris.  And he likes, he's a cute guy.  He's got karate tattoos so you know he's got the commitment.  Judo.  Judo tattoos.  He has the winning move.  Whatever, kill people tattoos.  The winning move.  I know the story of the tattoo.  What?  The winning move he used to win the Nationals in Judo, he had tattooed on his arm.  That's a badass.  Well, he comes up to me and he goes, let me show you what I did to this guy. 
[00:35:30]  And no matter how gentle he tries to be, he's like, you know, he put his arm around  the crook of his arm around my throat and just squeezed a little and choked me out.  Okay.  Like for two seconds.  It's a great move.  I just don't like when people show stuff because anybody that's showing you stuff,  I can't learn how to fight because I'm too much of a pussy to have someone show me the  moves.  Why do you let him do these things?  Because he's a big guy.  He can do whatever he wants.  He's big.  He can come in here and rape us all.  We wouldn't even know. 
[00:36:00]  That's the reality of it.  There's nothing we can do.  Hey, where is this guy?  Come up here today.  I dare you.  Oh, really?  See, she's doing a cute radio thing, but this guy also is a little psychopath.  Okay, don't come up here today.  He would take you up on it.  No.  He can't get past the security here, though.  Okay.  That's true.  Thank God.  Those old idiots downstairs.  They're the worst.  Every day they see him, and they still want ID.  I hate them.  Can you hit one of them when you go out, please?  Yeah.  Just say he harassed you or something.  The little short, fat one there, it looks like he has Down syndrome.  Just punch him.  It just stinks. 
[00:36:30]  All right.  So we've got to move on, but it's the ultimate fights for the movies.  Yeah.  Fist fights, sword fights.  Oh, yeah.  Street fights, gun fights, girl fights.  That's my fave.

[00:37:00]  Thank you so much.  Is there Bruce Lee footage in there?  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  No, no.  Actually, it was Bruce Lee's story.  It wasn't Bruce Lee.  It was his son or something.  Yeah, from the dragon.  Yeah, it was pretty cool.  But number two, they're looking at getting that.  They're looking at doing a second one.  There's a website, too, ultimate-fights.com.  All right.  All right.  Well, thanks for coming by, guys.  We greatly appreciate it.  I'm so happy you guys aren't that obnoxious at all.  No, I know.  Everyone warned us about it.  I was ready to say that.  No. 
[00:37:30]  No.  No.  See?  I just came in with mine also.  Cool.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Look.  Now she's got to bend over to get something and give everyone a great shot.  That's a nice guess right there.  Yeah.  You're so sexy.  It's depressing.  Yeah, you're beautiful.  You really are.  Thank you so much.  And we're nice guys, right?  Yeah.  Of course we are.  I know.  It's too bad your eyes aren't on TV.  Nah.  You're also nice looking.  Nah.  Look at Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  Even from the side. 
[00:38:00]  I have a weak chin.  That's the least of his problems, though.  Go along with your biceps and abs.  Yeah, I know.  It's true.  I have a body tone of egg salad.  It's a little pale nothing.  All right, guys.  Thank you so much.  Thanks a lot.  Okay.  Well, there's radio.  There's edgy.  There's psychotic.  And then there's Owen X.  The Opie and Anthony Show.

Yeah.  And right now on the phone it's...  Linda Blair.  Linda Blair.  The power of Christ compels you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Woo hoo.  The power of Christ compels you. 
[00:39:00]  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELS YOU!

I don't know how much longer I could have done that.  Oh, Jesus.  I still think the Ruth Buzzi one was better.  Yeah.  No, I learned more from this.  Yeah?  She's like, hello, hello, I'm hanging up.  Three, two, one, I'm bored.  She's speaking like the devil.  She was possessed.  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  Maybe she'd have been more interested if we spoke English backwards.  By the way, I hope people are drinking it out there because I did a Linda Blair impression.  Right, right.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh, Linda Blair?  Call him back.  The power of Christ compares you!  The power of Christ compares you!  The power of Christ compares you!  The power of Christ compares you!

[00:42:30]  Yeah.  I don't know why she calls bang.  All right.  Whoo!  Bang!  Ba-bang!  Bang!  Bang!  It's Friday.  And Johnny Fingers from Jersey has to point out the one time I said,  The cowards of Christ compels you.  All right.  Shut up, jackass.  I got it right 150 times.  The cowards of Christ.  Pick the one spot I said, The cowards of Christ. 
[00:43:00]  The cowards of Christ.  It happens.  Shut up.  Well, the one time you said, Pin Lawton.  Pin Lawton.  I'm going to rub him out.  All right.  Stroke.  Awful.  Hey, let's move on, huh?  Yes.  Oh, we got to talk about Robert Blake there.  Lil Bobby Blake.  You know, who didn't see this coming?  Pull the goddamn tape of when this first went down.  All right.  Your pals, Opie and Anthony, came on the air and said, 
[00:43:30]  This man is absolutely guilty of the murder of his wife.  Please.  Don't even try for a second.  The guy, I mean, OJ did a better job.  Actually, he did.  He got off the hook.  You know, it's interesting.  They won't go for the death penalty with OJ, but they will go with Robert Blake as a politically  correct L.A. faggot.  Watch.  You think so?  They already left the special circumstances.  Now, Blake is screwed.  Robert Blake arrested, because they arrested the bodyguard. 
[00:44:00]  Thank you.  And they're going to cut a deal with the bodyguard, and this guy is going to, he's going to like,  he's going to sing.  See, you got to act alone.  Like the OJ.  Yeah, he was arrested Thursday for killing his wife nearly a year ago.  They arrested him, and it seems he not only was trying to hire somebody to kill her,  when that didn't pan out, he shot her himself, is what the police are saying. 
[00:44:30]  He was the trigger man.  That's tough, man.  If you hate somebody enough where you want them dead, and you hire somebody, I mean, legally,  you're just as guilty, and you know, you get the death penalty, or put away for life,  or whatever.  But, just the thought of actually doing it, there's one thing if you hire somebody.  All right, I want that person rubbed out.  But to put the gun against their head and pull the trigger, and then walk into that restaurant,  remember?  Yeah. 
[00:45:00]  Apparently, he shot her, and walked back into the restaurant they were dining in,  and say he dropped his gun.  Maybe he gave the gun to the bodyguard.  Maybe that's the bodyguard's part.  He might have the gun instead take off and hide it.  Right, because he threw in a dumpster.  Smart.  He fell asleep at his girlfriend's house.  With tight, wonderful little underwear on that just showed both butt cheeks.  Damn Sam Jackson!  Yeah, so the cops are saying he shot her in the head, went back into the restaurant, 
[00:45:30]  said he lost his gun, dropped his gun.  Sit down and finish his dinner.  I sit down and finish my dinner.  He had a drink of water, and the guy said he looked really nervous.  Well, yeah, he had just shot his wife.  And now a year later, see, they didn't make the same O.J. mistake here.  They waited.  They waited before they arrested him to come up with everything they need.  Believe me, they're going to come out with so much evidence against this guy. 
[00:46:00]  And if you ask me, it sounds like the woman deserved it.  Yep.  I mean, you know, you don't go shooting people.  Well, there was a lot of things going on.  She told Robert Blake that she was on the pill.  Yeah, she wound up getting pregnant.  Not only she wasn't on the pill, Anthony, she was taking fertility drugs so she could get knocked up by Robert Blake.  I don't know why Robert Blake decided that he had to marry her at the point that she was pregnant, you know.  But he did.  And then she's pulling all this crap. 
[00:46:30]  She's got guys that she's mailing pictures to and bilking them out of their money.  She had some kind of a scam going where she'd answer, like, Lonely Hearts ads and send pictures and profess her love to these guys.  And then bilk them out of money.  So she was like a con artist.  And she conned Robert Blake.  And Robert Blake, I guess he was looking at divorce and seeing that it's a little too expensive. 
[00:47:00]  He's not a gentleman.  Robert Blake is not a gentleman.  And he shot her.  To get rid of her.  He should be put away for banging that mess.  He can only keep one eye on the sparrow.  There's a glance at it.  O-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo.  O-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo.  Yes.  Oh, Sammy David Jr., you didn't know that, Norton? 
[00:47:30]  That's a guy named Robert Blake.  He's not a guy named Robert Blake.  You know, Norton, it's that new television show, Beretta.  Where can I go where the cold winds don't blow now?  No, no.  Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well.  Oh, one shot to the head.  Dude, I did not know that the glass-eyed sang that.  Yeah.  Yes, he did.  I love it.  Why didn't you talk there?  I kept you. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, yeah.  Well, this goes back to one of Robert Blake's first roles.  You might remember him as Lil Mickey from the Our Gang, the Little Rascal.  The Little Rascal.  He's always cute.  He had very chuffle-able hair.  He was a little chap back then.  Mickey, what did they call you?  He actually went by his real name, I think.  Mickey Gubitose.  Mickey Gubitose. 
[00:48:30]  Chuffle-able hair.  And I'm looking at this Our Gang Kids little biography page on what happened to him.  He is just one in a long line of horrific human stories that happened to these kids.  Awful.  Let's read what they said about Robert Blake.  This is a little too, I guess the latest events with him being arrested, a little too recent to be stated here.  But he became a powerful adult performer, a leading character and role star in the series Beretta. 
[00:49:00]  In the 70s, consumed with anger over his treatment by his family and the studio as a child, he denigrated his early work.  Suffered bouts of difficulty with drugs.  Became known as a difficult, perfectionist person to work with.  He quit his successful TV series, Helltown, in 1985 when his personal demons became overwhelming.  After self-imposed exile for nearly eight years, during which he struggled to write his life.  His successful return to films and television appeared renewed and more confident in himself and his work. 
[00:49:30]  Currently, he lives in California.  In the jail.  But, like I said, just a long line.  If you look back, let's go to, remember Alfalfa?  Alfalfa.  Remember Alfalfa Schweitzer?  Sure.  A little Alfalfa with the, you couldn't tussle his hair.  It was all flicked down and he had that little thing sticking up out of the back.  He, born in 1927, Opie.  He died a short 31 years later. 
[00:50:00]  In 1959.  Known as always the clown on the set, Alfalfa Schweitzer acted it up after he left our gang and he had run-ins with the law.  And in 59, he was shot to death over money allegedly owed to him by a business partner.  He was 31 years old.  Listen to this little detailed account of it.  After a night of drinking, Alfalfa and his friend, Jack, went to collect money from Bud Stiltz on the evening of January 21st, 59th. 
[00:50:30]  You never try to collect money from a guy named Bud Stiltz.  Bud Stiltz when you're all drunk and it's 1959.  Everything's in black and white.  You don't know what to do.  It all looks like some crime movie.  They're all wearing those funny hats.  Yeah, save me.  I'm Alfalfa Schweitzer.  So he pounded on the door, posing as a police officer with his friend, and forced his way into the house late at night while the guy's wife and kids were sleeping.  Open the door, save me.  Wouldn't he look just like Alfalfa with a police cap on it?  I know. 
[00:51:00]  Hey, it's Alfalfa.  What are you doing, man?  I'm not a cop.  You're Alfalfa.  It's Halloween.  I know who you are.  Ah, I'm a cop, spank.  Bud Stiltz claimed that Alfalfa threw a knife at him across the room.  Alfalfa was then shot by Bud Stiltz in the stomach and died.  He claimed it was self-defense, and he was let off the hook.  So no one served any time for killing beloved Alfalfa. 
[00:51:30]  Then we got the likes of Buckwheat.  Buckwheat, he had a stable life but died of a heart attack at the age of 49.  Young.  That's okay.  Hey, he done good.  That's young, though.  Yeah.  Your heart's sure, 49, 40, 40.  Well, not as bad as poor Chubbsy-Ubbsy.  Remember Chubbsy-Ubbsy.  Chubbsy-Ubbsy.  He grew into his teens, and his weight expanded to over 300 pounds. 
[00:52:00]  In 1935, he had an operation for a glandular ailment.  He didn't have a stomach staple, did he?  They didn't do that back then, of course not.  Did he say we're using scotch tape?  He had an operation for a glandular ailment.  His weight dropped to 136 pounds when he died at the age of 18 years old.  Wow.  18.  Oh.  This one girl, just known as Vaughn, her name was. 
[00:52:30]  I don't know what the hell that's all about.  She got sickly, had an operation,  and everything was going well until she contracted hepatitis in the hospital  and died at 47.  Aren't these fun stories?  Wow.  What about Ms. Crabtree?  Ah, Ms. Crabtree, I have something heavy on my heart. 
[00:53:00]  Well, Ms. Crabtree had Parkinson's disease.  And died.  Hey, look at Ms. Crabtree is shaking.  You know what the reality is?  No matter who you are,  it's always going to be a bad ending.  You're going to get something bad.  Sometimes you have to realize, though, that we are all mortal,  that they breathe the same air we do.  Mickey Daniels, from the very early R gang,  died of cirrhosis of the liver. 
[00:53:30]  His body was found in a hotel room.  He died alone.  Hey, great aunt.  Scotty Beckett.  Remember little Scotty?  Remember little Scotty?  You used to hang out with Spanky?  Little Scotty?  Little Scotty.  He had the sweater that was always kind of,  the neck was too big and it was pulled over his shoulder-like,  and him and Spanky would go around,  causing all kinds of pandemonium and hijinks.  Um, no.  He was beaten to death and died at 38. 
[00:54:00]  Wow.  Aren't these fun stories?  Hey, kids, next,  we're going to talk about all the disease that could kill you.  Spanky lived to, um,  to a 64 where he died of a heart attack.  He was a little TV salesman.  And Weezer,  remember Weezer?  Weezer died in a military airplane accident at 19 years old.  John, that's impossible.  I just saw them the other night.  Not Weezer the band, you fool.  But his brother in this show,  remember his brother, 
[00:54:30]  uh, Jackie?  Jackie Cooper?  He was in the Superman movies.  Yeah.  Uh, Perry White.  Perry White.  What about the,  uh,  the yum yum eat em up kid?  Uh, what,  the kid?  Yeah,  the kid that,  that was his line,  yum yum.  No,  that was the,  uh,  the,  uh,  that was the boogeyman.  Yeah,  the boogeyman guy.  Actually,  it was the,  the wild man from Borneo.  Yeah,  yeah.  Actually,  I think it was just the Negro  that they had run around going,  yum yum,  eat em up kid.  And that was Spanky running around. 
[00:55:00]  He goes,  you can't eat me.  My mama says,  I'm spoiled.  So,  incidentally,  a bit of kid trivia,  the kid that,  the Charlie Chaplin film,  the kid,  yeah,  famous,  that little,  that little fella.  Sure.  Uh,  grew up to be Uncle Fester.  That's right.  Jackie Coogan.  Lil' Jackie Coogan.  Lil' Jackie.  Well,  there you go.  Just a few more of the horror stories  and,  uh,  Mickey Gubitose or Robert Blake.  There you go.  The curse.  The hour gang curse,  they call it.  Hey,  is Froggy listed there?  Or Darla? 
[00:55:30]  Were they both famous?  Froggy is dead,  too.  I know he died young.  I believe in,  uh,  World War II.  Something like that.  Andrew.  And Darla's dead,  too.  She died.  Well,  he and Anthony,  pleasure for me.  Hey,  we're at the big casino.  Yeah.  What's up,  Andrew?  You know,  Celebrity Skin this month,  I think it was this month,  last month,  there was pictures of,  uh,  Bonnie Blakely naked.  She's pretty nasty.  She got,  like,  the Farrah hairdo  and to steal a few amps.  She had,  uh,  Abraham Lincoln in a leg lock.  Oh,  big muff.  Yeah.  A disgusting muff.  Somebody sent me a link  in my email 
[00:56:00]  and I went to,  but it's supposed to be  a picture of J-Lo  with,  uh,  no,  um,  panties.  Yeah.  And,  uh,  I think it's fake.  You think so?  Yeah,  I think a lot of those are fake.  Maybe.  Is it the one with her  getting out of the truck?  Yes.  I think that one's real.  That one looks real.  And can I tell you,  lovely.  Just what I like.  Oh,  Jim,  get out of there.  Those are too thick and plump.  Ah,  cut it out.  No,  they're not.  I saw that one.  Oh,  do I like them much.  Yeah.  But there's another one  where she's against the wall 
[00:56:30]  and,  uh,  I don't think that's her.  No,  I like the,  uh,  yeah,  I mean,  they could superimpose,  but that was pretty nice.  I don't like the fake porn like that.  No,  I like them real  and plump and lovely.  He's smooth.  Hey,  we're going to take a break.  All right.  When we get back,  I think we're playing  the gangster game with,  Yeah,  it's about time.  Back and pig.  Are they here?  Are they stiffing us?  It's getting late in the show.  We've got to play  the gangster game  with Lady Di Marion.  Some people,  uh,  on instant feedback  calling the Linda Blair interview, 
[00:57:00]  best interview ever  on this program.  Well,  thank you.  Thank you.  We try.  We work hard at it.  That was nice.  Thanks,  guys.  We appreciate that.  Uh-oh.  The hotline's ringing.  Uh-oh.  Maybe another has-been?  I mean,  uh,  another celebrity  that Big Kev is,  uh,  getting for us?  That's what you mean.  Celebrity.  Huh?  Oh,  styling out.  All right.  All right.  So,  we'll,  uh,  we'll step aside.  We'll come back.  We'll play the,  uh,  the gangster game  with,  uh,  Lady Diane Marion.  Also,  we've got to say hi to Devin,  man,  from Home Alone.  Yes.  We saw him staggering around 
[00:57:30]  the Jim Norton show last night.  We haven't seen him in a long time.  Another tragic case  of one of the Our Gang kids.  Yes.  Little Devin.  Lady Diane Marion  just checked in from 55th Street.  They're just two blocks away  and they're running  with those short little troll legs.  Are you going to be here,  right, Devin?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll play the gang,  you know,  we'll play the gangster game next  with the Regardeau,  the Vernon Shirley  and,  we'll have,  uh,  Devin from Home Alone  help us out.  Very good.  All right.  And we got prizes and stuff.  Stop,  Jim.  I'm not falling for it today.  Hi,  we're here.  We're here under your skin 
[00:58:00]  on two A-holes.  Hello.  Opie and Anthony.  Ah,  Anthony,  uh,  Anthony,  sorry.  I'm distracted by Jim here.  Twisted to you,  yes.  Yes.  Nice weather out.  Very warm.  Maybe you don't want  the normal beverage  that might weigh you down  a little bit.  So what do you do?  You grab yourself  a Twisted Tea.  It's easy drinking,  refreshing,  hard iced tea.  Hard.  You know what that means,  right?  It's got a little  something in it. 
[00:58:30]  Hey,  you can party with this stuff.  Maybe you're out  at the beach.  Some of the beverages  that are good at the bars  ain't too good at the beach,  right?  Right.  Twisted Tea's perfect.  Pull that one  out of the cooler.  Crack that top of it.  Ah,  available in bottles  and their 12-ounce cans.  It's made from  some of the finest teas  in the world.  Tastes great.  So pop open a party  with Twisted Tea.  Of course,  it's made from  the Boston Beer Company.  So you know it's good. 
[00:59:00]  So keep it around  for your summertime parties.  Twisted Tea.  I know,  we're going to talk to them  in a second.  Bye!  Bye!  Godsmack!  I stand alone!  The Scorpion King,  I see,  which is getting mixed reviews,  is it?  Some people loving it  and other reviewers  hating it. 
[00:59:30]  I'll wait  until it's  a Madam video  or something.  All right,  our buddy Big Kev  with breaking news  for the convention center  where all the  has-beens are.  Oh my God.  He gave us  a couple interviews  today,  Anthony.  He gave us  Ruth Buzzi,  he gave us  Linda Blair.  We were busy  when he wanted  Horshack  on our show today.  Yeah.  And who else?  Jeff Conway?  Yeah,  yeah.  From Taxi?  From Taxi,  sure.  And now Big Kev?  I'm out in the rain. 
[01:00:00]  What?  I have been removed  from the premises.  No,  no.  What happened?  What happened?  I don't know  what you guys did  to Linda Blair.  She's like royalty  at this thing  and I was  bodily removed.  Stop it.  That must have  taken a lot of body.  I was removed  from the  Chiller Theater  Convention  in Secaucus.  What happened?  How did it go down?  I was shopping,  preparing for my  interview with  Adam West.  Yes.  And  they  four or five 
[01:00:30]  security persons  approached me  and said,  Big Kev,  you have to say  they are pissed.  Oh,  you don't know  what we did?  No.  You weren't?  We did it all  on our own.  I wasn't there.  Oh.  I have no idea  and they won't tell me.  Oh,  when they escorted me out,  I asked them  what happened  and they said,  we don't want  to talk about it,  but it was plenty horrible  is what it was.  It wasn't all that bad.  I think whatever you did  must not have been  her brand of humor.  I think she got  a little impatient 
[01:01:00]  with us  and perhaps  it was a little monotonous.  Yeah,  yeah.  But  a little repetitive.  A little repetitive.  What did you do?  Just tell me  what you did.  Well,  just,  okay.  Picture,  picture your  Linda Blair.  Wow,  that's really  a tough one.  Okay.  That's a script.  Okay.  Let's just imagine  you're hearing  what Linda Blair  was hearing.  Okay?  Okay.  We pick up the phone.  There you are,  Linda Blair.  The power of Christ 
[01:01:30]  compels you!  The power of Christ  compels you!  The power of Christ  compels you!  The power of Christ  compels you!  And,  and Kev,  Kev,  it didn't stop  no matter what she said.  Until she hung up,  right?  Twice,  yes.  Twice,  yes,  yeah.  Unbelievable.  Yes,  it was some people  saying our best  celebrity interview  to date.  Let me tell you,  they brought their  five biggest guys  to escort me out  like I had killed  somebody.  Oh,  my God.  Linda Blair is like, 
[01:02:00]  I told you,  she's like royalty  at this place.  Really?  Oh,  man.  Right away,  she called down  and I was removed.  I'm standing out  in the rain now.  Oh,  Kev.  Oh,  I love that visual.  Well,  yeah.  I'm really upset  because,  you know,  you guys are now  going to miss  the opportunity  to talk to Adam West.  You were setting up  an Adam West interview?  Wow.  Superstar Adam West  was prepared  to talk  on the Opie  and Anthony  show today.  Wow. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  All right,  Kev.  Better luck  in two years.  Oh,  no.  People asking,  Joey Big Arm  saying,  did Big Kev  ask for his  Ticketmaster  service charge back?  No,  I didn't pay.  Did Adam West  try to remove  him like Big Kev  was a supervillain?  Yeah,  that was it.  He was a supervillain.  And why couldn't  you get the guy  that was in  the ALF suit?  Actually,  you know what?  I was looking 
[01:03:00]  for Bob May,  but he's not  here this time.  Oh,  I hope he's not  ill.  And it doesn't  matter anyway  because they've  been removed.  All right,  Big Kev.  Why don't you  try to get back  in and smooth  things over?  I'll try to get  back in,  but I don't think  it's going to  happen.  Tell him,  you know,  we'll give him  a bunch of  great plugs.  Okay,  I'll see what  I can do.  All right.  Thanks,  Big Kev.  Later.  There you go.  Wow,  that's horrible.  Hey,  Tina,  real fast  because we've  got to move  on with the  retarded Laverne  Shirley.  What's up?  Hi,  my name is  Tina.  I just wowed  a truck driver 
[01:03:30]  on a parkway.  Well,  thank you so  much for doing  that.  Did he have  a wow  in the back  of his truck?  Yeah.  See?  There you go.  Was that a girl?  Maybe that was  Linda Blair getting  us back.  All right,  why don't we  get Devin from  Home Alone  in here,  Anthony?  Yes.  You might remember  him as Buzz.  Shouldn't he be  on a phone?  No,  I'm just kidding.  You are.  Look,  you just heard  everybody go,  oh,  oh. 
[01:04:00]  Nothing.  I just thought,  you know,  you might want  to call the show  today.  You're horrible.  So there's Buzz  from Home Alone.  Hey,  man.  Hey,  guys.  How are you doing?  You want to help  us out with the  gangster game?  Absolutely.  All right,  cool.  What?  What's the gangster game?  We're going to explain  in a second here.  Okay.  All right.  And do we have  our list of prizes  and stuff?  Okay.  Why don't we,  do we have the  Retard Laverne Shirley  song?  They've got to get  their intro song  here. 
[01:04:30]  They're helping us  out with the  gangster game.  I'm just looking at,  once again,  looking at Devin's  resume here  on the Internet  of the database.  You were indeed  in Dennis the Menace.  I was in Dennis the Menace.  And you were Mickey  in Dennis the Menace?  I was Mickey.  Making out  Natasha Lyonne.  Oh.  Her first movie.  She was petrified.  Nice.  Tongue?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  No?  She was 13.  She was 13.  She was scared.  Really?  She was scared  of Esquilus.  Home Alone 2, 
[01:05:00]  of course.  Buzz McAllister in that  also.  Indeed, yes.  Worth winning.  Worth winning.  One of the prize films.  One of the prize films  of cinematic history.  Worth winning.  Mark Harmon.  Who else is in that?  Oh, Mark Harmon?  Mark Harmon, look at you.  Look at you, sir.  I played the son  of Leslie Ann Warren.  Madeline Stowe,  Leslie Ann Warren.  Leslie Ann Warren, hot.  Yeah.  Big bazookas.  Didn't even know it  until I did the movie.  Really?  Yeah, and I saw her  in her leather outfit.  She's in a leather outfit  in the movie.  I was like,  solid. 
[01:05:30]  Fred Savage,  Howie Mandel,  Daniel Stern,  name the movie.  What, are you waiting  for me to name it?  I know the movie.  Little Monster.  Little Monster.  Little Monster.  You were in that one.  What can your monstrosity?  You were a little  Ronnie Coleman.  I was, indeed.  Who put pee  in my apple juice?  Is that a line?  A famous line?  Yes, that is.  That's what it is.  The liver.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Much gusto.  Thank you.  What's your most famous line?  What's your most famous line? 
[01:06:00]  Most famous line?  Probably,  it's got to be  from home alone.  I wouldn't let you  sleep in my room  if you were growing  on my ass.  I hate that.  I hate that.  Second most famous  from Home Alone 2,  a lot of people  seem to respond  to this line,  beat that,  you little trout sniffer.  I don't even know  what a trout sniffer is.  We held that production  on the set  for 45 minutes  trying to think  of another insult  because Chris Columbus  and I had no idea  what trout sniffer was, 
[01:06:30]  but John...  Trout sniffer.  Trout sniffer.  Well, nowadays,  I mean, hey,  you could probably  have a little...  Well, you would think,  right, it would be  something having to do  with female genitalia.  Well, yeah,  but this is a Christmas film,  so we're thinking,  oh, it couldn't be.  It couldn't be that.  So John Hughes  wrote down trout sniffer  and we're like,  you know, well,  it's got to be something else.  We're trying to think  of something to do  in his ear  and during the choir scene  thinking about,  you know,  some insult like there  and finally we're just like,  no, F it.  He's a trout sniffer.  A trout sniffer.  I like it.  I get so much crap  in bars like,  hey, trout sniffer. 
[01:07:00]  He's a trout sniffer.  Claude Akins,  Courtney Cox,  Faith Ford.  The list even first.  Name the movie.  No one's going  to name that movie.  No one.  What is it?  That would be...  That would...  What the hell's name?  I don't know  what I'm saying.  If it's Tuesday,  it still must be Belgium.  Right.  There you go.  The remake.  And what was that about?  It was a terrible film.  It was awful.  NBC Movie of the Week.  It was an all-star cast.  Right, TV movie.

Now she's an acting coach.  My father's an actor.  Who knows Ruth Buzzy,  by the way.  Thank you very much, guys.  We had a great time  with Ruth Buzzy today.  She's a great butter thing.  What's your mom's name? 
[01:08:00]  Ann Willis Rattray.  But you probably wouldn't  see too many films  that she's in.  She was in one film  with my dad.  What movie?  Train Ride to Hollywood.  Train Ride to Hollywood.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Hollywood.  Starring Bloodstone,  the soul band  that never was  of the 1970s.  There it is.  Train Ride to Hollywood,  1978.  And what's the name?  I'm sorry.  Ann Willis Rattray.

Another World.  Mm-hmm.  The Abyss.  He was the captain  in The Abyss.  My father.  Was he really?  My father was the captain  of the submarine in The Abyss.  You know, Michael Bean,  who goes down to get the key  off the submarine captain's neck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's my dad.  I mean, he's in the whole  opening scene where he's like,  blow the buoys!  Blow everything!  We're losing her!  You know? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Really?  I really like that movie.  It's a great movie, right?  Wait a minute.  Is it a DVD, is it?  Young Lady Chatterley?  No!  That is some of the  Cinema 100 softcore  that I used to see on cable.  Oh, no.  We've seen your dad's mules?  Oh, my God!  He was Paul the Young Gardener.  Paul the Gardener.

He's on the poster  making out with Young Lady Chatterley. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  Why really?  I bet you after 10 minutes  I'll be like, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're just afraid  that that might be  what you're thinking.

She decides to continue  the fruitful relationship  to the personnel.  My father raised me well.  His father's a good...  And gets it on  with the handsome  young gardener herself.  No!
