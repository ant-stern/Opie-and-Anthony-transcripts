<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The "After Opie and Anthony Live" broadcast hosted by Sam Roberts covered a wide range of topics.  The show opened with a discussion about an upcoming, high-budget Bobo production featuring Bobo and a major A-list celebrity, slated for release the following day. Eric, and possibly others, contributed voice work.  The mystery surrounding the celebrity's identity and the nature of the production fueled much of the early conversation. This was followed by a humorous segment dissecting a still-airing Playboy Radio promo for Hugh Hefner's wedding, despite its cancellation.  The hosts, including Troy, debated responsibility for airing outdated promotional material, leading to jokes about raises and retroactive pay.

A "This Day in O&A History" segment revisited a two-year-old clip about an infomercial for "Comfort Wipe," a toilet paper aid for larger individuals, provoking a flurry of crude jokes about hygiene and bodily functions.  The show then transitioned to a discussion of Patrice's prior conversation with Opie regarding conspiracy theories, highlighting their differing approaches and reactions to the subject. Sam expressed a lack of interest in deep dives into conspiracy theories.

A pre-recorded interview with Gene Simmons formed a significant portion of the broadcast. The interview, described as tense, marked Simmons' final appearance on the show.  The segment was dominated by Simmons promoting his own projects, including his book "Ladies of the Night," causing friction with the hosts.  The hosts discussed editing choices, specifically the exclusion of a segment involving Jill Nicolini, a decision which a later caller expressed dissatisfaction with.

The broadcast included appearances by several other guests, including Greg Charles, Roland, Bob Kelly, and a brief mention of Who Kid.  The show concluded with the usual closing banter and final remarks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus, Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Who works for Playboy Radio?  Does anybody know? It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  Patrice was out of here, I mean, before the production even started, okay?  He was gone.  The invitation was laid out to him. 
[00:00:30]  But he decided today he wasn't going to partake in the After Opie and Anthony Live activities.  We are working on a guest booking.  I know Bob Kelly is in the building.  And if all goes according to plan, which it never does, we may get a Bob Kelly appearance later on.  He's doing the interview with the show that Tom Papa does right now.  He's doing an interview with him.  I don't know when that's going to air.  Otherwise, I would tell you.  But if he's walking around, I'm sure we'll grab him.  Eric, do you know anybody who works for Playboy Radio? 
[00:01:00]  No, I don't.  But I spoke to some other people and they were amazed that that promo was still running.  Who did you speak to?  It just happened.  Yeah.  I called somebody in charge.  Bring him in.  No, I'm going to.  Come on.  No, I think you know how I am.  Greg Charles is here from Caroline's.  I'm just saying hi.  Just saying hi.  Hello, Greg Charles.  Roland, that's like your best friend, correct?  Yeah.  Is he just going to stand in the doorway?  You.  No, I was going to shut the door.  Huh?  What?  What do you mean, what do you want?  You came in here, Roland. 
[00:01:30]  I didn't ask you.  Why are you asking me what I want when you walked into my studio?  That's your studio.  What's the name of the show?  That'll be an anthony show.  Incorrect.  Check the clock.  This shit out.  Do you know anybody who works for Playboy Radio?  They still have it?  I thought it was on.  No, no, no.  It's on.  I'm just asking because while the commercials were running just now, a promo just aired saying  with all kind of wedding music and saying this weekend, everybody tune in for the big 
[00:02:00]  Hugh Hefner wedding.  Other than I had to get married.  Danny, do you know who works for Playboy Radio?  What you got?  What's that?  Well, it was this day in O&A, but O&A is over.  So instead of just wasting it, you could play it.  It's from today?  It's for today.  What's the deal with the secret production that was being in the works with Bobo?  I didn't announce what it was.  Oh, well, I don't know.  What are we?  I just walked into this.  I don't know what we're talking about.  I just brought it up because you walked in.  There's literally.  I mean, I was talking.  It's almost ready to go.  It's a secret, right?  We're J.J. Abramsing this? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, it's much akin to 8mm.  It's a secret of big, big time, big, big budget movie.  We have stars involved in this.  I said it was in the same vein as Suicide was in the sense that it's a narrative starring Bobo.  It's a standalone.  It's not like we just took some production and smacked it all together.  Right.  And it's not like we took some audio from the show and just took it out of context.  There's no show audio, actually. 
[00:03:00]  It's all original.  It's all original, and I'm not going to say exactly who stars alongside Bobo, but Bobo  has a very prominent A-list co-star.  Celebrity.  Celebrity.  Now, is this a celebrity?  And they do have a scene together.  He's a nude.  Because I know Bobo almost always insists that his scenes be nude.  I wouldn't mind, personally, because, I mean, I'm always down for a good chuckle, but unfortunately,  no, no one was nude this time around.  Is this an A-lister, like an A-lister in the sense that, like, we would joke around with 
[00:03:30]  each other and say Bobo is an A-lister, or is this, like, a real celebrity?  No, this is a legitimate celebrity.  Much unlike Bobo, this is a legitimate celebrity.  Much unlike you said, correct?  Yes, that's right.  Okay, correct.  Wow, and Bobo is the star.  Bobo is the shining star.  When is this?  Do we have any sort of release date in mind?  I'm hoping for tomorrow.  Tomorrow!  It really should have been done today.  What a scoop!  Everything is done except basically the main, you know, the big voice guy, V.O. 
[00:04:00]  So once we get that in, tomorrow we will be finished with this.  We may hear this new Bobo production that we've been hearing about for a couple days.  This is very exciting.  Eric, do you know anything about this?  Yes, I do.  But don't say too much now.  No, I was asked to be a part of it.  I did some voice work for it.  It's great.  I performed a part, too.  It's very small, so I don't know a lot of details surrounding it because I didn't get  the rest of the script.  It's kept secret.  And I do that on purpose because I don't need the deets of this floating around.  The other lines were all blacked out. 
[00:04:30]  Also, I saw bite marks in some of my pages.  Did you give my script to E-Rock first?  Oh, funny.  Yeah, sorry.  I mean, he was just more available to record.  I gotcha.  All right.  I was actually just asking if we know anybody who works on Playboy Radio because I don't  know if you heard, but right before this show came on, commercials were running with  a whole bunch of wedding music playing, saying, this Saturday, it's the big Hugh Hefner wedding  special on Playboy Radio.  But I thought that that's over now. 
[00:05:00]  Yesterday, Hugh Hefner was announced that his wedding was called off.  So I just want to know what the backup plan for that is.  Well, you know, things around here, they work at the pace of SiriusXM.  Oh, one of the girls from Playboy Radio.  Oh, that's Troy.  I didn't recognize him in that t-shirt.  Yeah, I thought it was just a small-tittied girl.  But yeah, that's a nice little girl.  Do you know anybody who works for Playboy Radio?  Yeah, because of the promo?  Yeah.  That's my fault.  Oh.  It's not supposed to run?  Well, I didn't.  Nobody had said to pull it, and I guess I should have.  So then it's not your fault.  No, it's not your fault.  You can't, like, intuitive be like, yeah, I'm programming for Playboy Radio now. 
[00:05:30]  Well, no, they give me the promos that run during the show, and then I put them  in the system for when the show, when we're alive on the channel.  And it's up to you to say, you know, we probably shouldn't be running, look, Troy, I hate to  tell you this, but pulling, like, deciding what promos should not run because of things  that have gone on in the news and stuff, it's above your pay grade, bro.  Well, I know that.  Don't even worry about it.  I think phone screening's above his pay grade at this point.  But what they would probably say to me is, I should have been proactive with knowing 
[00:06:00]  that.  I'm just guessing what I'm going to be told.  If I were you, Troy, I'd respond.  We could all do a better job of that, you know?  I would respond, maybe you should be proactive with that checkbook, Holmes.  That's what I would say.  That'll go real far.  I don't know.  If you want me to be proactive, how about you be retroactive with a fucking raise?  Oh, shit.  You're speaking for Troy.  You just said, just said that.  That's down.  Oh, my God.  You should stick around because I would like to ask you about some of the stuff that went 
[00:06:30]  down at the end of the show with Patrice talking to Opie.  Yeah.  Because, again, the conspiracy, it's a whole different tune when it's not you.  But first, I wanted to play what Danny just gave me because it was an epic day.  This Day in O.N.A. History.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents...  Presents...  This Day in O.N.A.  In O.N.A.  Our favorite moments from this very day in Opie and Anthony history.  It was two years ago today, O.N.A. were first introduced to an infomercial for the 
[00:07:00]  Comfort Wipe, a toilet paper extension for fat people.  You're wiping your asshole with a stick.  That's diggity.  Dignifying.  Yeah, that's great.  Wiping shit all over your back because your nerves aren't right anymore.  You're just fucking shaking with it.  Shaking shit all over yourself.  Your fucking balls smell like a dog's asshole.  You're knocking your nuts around like fucking playing badminton.  Yeah, you're fucking...  You're dragging shit from the back of your ass up to your midsection. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  Your balls, dick, and stomachs smell like shit.  This has been This Day in O.N.A.  In O.N.A.  Our favorite moments from this very day in Opie and Anthony history.  I had no idea...  Eric.  What?  You're supposed to keep me abreast when we are broadcasting on a day of such significance.  Okay.  I did not know that today was Magic Wipe Day.  I didn't know either.  Well, where are you at here, buddy?  Come on.  I was just on the phone.  I'm supposed to let you know that the promo issue was not Troy's fault. 
[00:08:00]  Somebody else was claiming responsibility for it.  See what happened.  And he said, and he took care of it.  It's not going to run again.  Well, I'm not so concerned with the promo.  I want to know what's going on on Playboy Channel this weekend.  I want to know what they're programming.  Yeah.  What are they going to play?  I don't know.  I mean, I don't care so much about...  It's not like a, oh, why are they running this promo?  Who cares about the promo?  What's going to be on the air?  We can give them some old weird medicines if they want.  I don't even know where they base that...  I mean, I think they have a studio at the Playboy Mansion, but I don't know where they 
[00:08:30]  actually base that.  I mean, they've done Playboy events here, but nobody from the channel works here.  That hits one intern, the guy who's walking down the hallway right now.  He's turning the corner, so you'll see him out of that window.  He's way too muscular to be an intern in radio.  What's he doing?  Who's he impressing?  And he walks around with his tight little t-shirts on, like, what's up, ladies?  Yeah.  Nobody's looking at you.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I guess I was just now, wasn't I?  Apparently.  Yeah.  I mean, and by the way, you see, you bring something up on the air, all of a sudden,  you're not getting the blame so much, are you, buddy? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, why?  And I was fully willing to take responsibility for it, so...  I was told, quote, that the phone call was to prevent a witch hunt.  Oh, okay.  Well, I'm assuming that's Rob Cross.  Okay.  Because Rob is good like that.  Like, Rob would be like, you know what?  Let's just stop this already.  Yeah, well, because Rob's fucking real.  You know what I mean?  Like, he just, he's like, yo, this is what's going on.  This is, this is what's happening.  Well, make a list of the people above, you know, anywhere in management who've come on 
[00:09:30]  the air for Opie and Anthony and after Opie and Anthony Live.  And I've given Rob huge props for that.  Rob Cross is the list.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Look, he's the man.  But when we ended the show today, Patrice was in, obviously.  And Opie and Patrice ended up talking about conspiracy theories very briefly.  Yeah.  By the way, before we move on, I'm hoping, keep those eyes open.  And E-Rock, you keep your eyes open, too.  Because if we see Rich Davis walking around, at the top of the show, one of the callers  call in and said, Kavino and Rich were really buying into this Gene Simmons. 
[00:10:00]  I'll see if I can find him.  Shannon Tweed thing.  Because I would love to find out if he actually thought it was real.  Because that is a...  It wouldn't surprise me.  You wouldn't?  No.  Just because it's like, yeah, bro.  That was a good impression.  Who was that, Kavino or Rich?  I don't know.  I don't know the show well enough.  But they're good guys.  The conspiracy theories.  Yes.  Sorry.  Patrice was in here.  Yeah.  And he was saying, Opie, I think you are a conspiracy theorist.  And Opie was saying, yeah, maybe you're right. 
[00:10:30]  And he was like, maybe, you know what, Patrice comes out with this conspiracy theory.  And Opie goes, yeah, you kind of sold me on that.  Whereas you come in here, and they're like, what are you, a fucking idiot?  Like, they look at you like, are you some kind of moron coming in here with that?  Yeah.  And it's, sometimes it's the same theories.  Sometimes you're saying the exact same things.  Is there any part of you, when you're sitting in the other room, that's like, what the, what?  No, I don't, I could care less now.  I mean, you know, Patrice is so well-spoken. 
[00:11:00]  He knows how to articulate things well.  Is this a race thing?  No, no, no, not really.  I mean, he's a genius when it comes to speaking and knowing how to say things and lay things out.  And, you know, he does a lot of research that I just, I don't care about.  You know what I mean?  And so, I get it.  You know what I mean?  Like, and if they say something, he has a great answer for them that I probably wouldn't have.  Like, you don't get lost in the worlds of Wikipedias and YouTubes and just, like, because some people, like, it seems like Patrice comes up when he either comes up or hears about these conspiracy theories that he just completely falls into it and starts reading a whole bunch about it and goes, oh, shit. 
[00:11:30]  You don't do that?  No.  Like I said, I really don't dive into it too much.  I used to watch all of Alex Jones' documentaries and stuff, and then it just starts fucking with your head, man.  I mean, it really does.  It starts really getting depressing of, like, this world sucks.  What happens, though, is, like, the more, like, conspiracy theories are good, like, on the outskirt, but the deeper you go into conspiracy theories, the more you're like, well, this is lying just as much as mainstream. 
[00:12:00]  Like, what am I?  Yeah, but it's all lies.  It is, and it's confusing on who to believe, and, you know, politicians and people that are in charge are liars, and there's always an agenda to what they do.  So the fact, the idea that they may have been involved with some of this stuff, 9-11, whatever, is a possibility in my mind. 
[00:12:30]  Now, I don't have the exact details to tell you that, and really, I mean, even if I did, what could I do about it?  You think entering into a life of a politician is, you're inherently an evil or a lying type of person?  Well, you just, you know how to lie, you know how to manipulate, and it's about, there's an agenda.  There's a bottom line, and...  So, when Patrice is in here saying these things, do you like that somebody gets to come on here and get these points across without being made to look like a turd? 
[00:13:00]  Or are you, like, are you sitting there, like, I wish I could have, like, a little of that respect?  No, I honestly don't care, and I have never, ever once since I've been working for Opie and Anthony have I ever asked to come into the studio and talk about conspiracy theories.  I've never been...  No, they pull you in, don't they?  They just, they pull me in, and they want me to talk about it.  And I do my best, but I've never wanted to come in and do it. 
[00:13:30]  So, and I, whenever it comes up, I stay there until they say...  Do you want to see me say something rude to Nicole?  Go ahead.  No, what do you mean?  Just come in.  She's putting her finger up.  She's telling me, watch this.  What do you mean?  Just for a second.  I gotta go record some stuff.  I just wanted to tell you that Opie told me as far as the mashup goes, less is more on the after show.  Meaning he doesn't want us on the show anymore?  No, no, no, not that he doesn't want you, just that, like, in small increments would be better.  So basically he felt as though you were ODing on us. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, like he said, you got a lot of it, maybe if we shrink that down, that'd be better.  Hey, fuck you, Opie.  I love ya.  You smell really good, by the way.  I do?  Yeah.  Oh my god, not like booze, because I'm so hungover.  Are you hungover?  Did you drink a lot last night?  I did.  I went to a charity event, and I, well, not too many.  Well, then tell me this, how did Troy end up waking up with your shirt on?  I think he looks fucking hot in that shirt.  It's just a joke.  It's a, you're wearing a pink t-shirt, I can say that. 
[00:14:30]  It's just.  I can say it.  He wishes he could rock shit like this.  100%.  Because he knew he'd get ripped a new asshole.  When have I cared about getting ripped a new asshole?  I'm out of here, less is more.  Peace out, Nicole.  I wear Lady Gaga t-shirts to work.  Right.  I'd wear a Lady Gaga t-shirt.  It's a Kwan-spiracy, spiracy, spiracy.  See, I feel like talking conspiracies just to hear that, because I love it.  It's a Kwan-spiracy, spiracy, spiracy.  I don't know.  Eric just came in here and showed me those buttons. 
[00:15:00]  It said push them.  I love it.  All right.  Eric, did you find out where, if anything on the Gene Simmons thing?  Is he in there?  Yeah, I'm here.  What's up?  I wish we had the monitor back.  Where is Mars?  When are we going to get the monitor back?  Hi, Rob.  Hi.  Rob's here checking out.  Ask Rob Cross if he knows when we're going to get the monitor back so I can see you.  Do you know when we're going to get the monitor back?  Yeah, that should be in a few minutes.  Today?  I don't know.  You filthy liar.  Well, thank you, Troy.  Sure.  And while we see if anybody around here knows, is Travis coming up this way? 
[00:15:30]  Ask Travis if he's coming into the studio or if he's going to production or something else.  Are you coming in the studio?  Are you coming in here or that way?  Oh, okay.  Because otherwise I'll throw it a bit.  I think you want to talk to me.  You want to talk to me?  No, no, no.  I said, are you coming in here or should I throw it a bit?  What's this?  For the show.  Oh.  Troy, could you come in here?  Um, so tell me this.  I don't think this is terrible timing on all this. 
[00:16:00]  So you think 9-11 could have been an inside job?  I don't know.  You know, you know, you know, you know.  I don't trust anybody.  There has been an attempt on the life of President Kennedy.  I want to see the body.  No, no.  There is an agenda with our government.  We've been lied to before.  It's one small step for me.  Do you know for sure?  It's a little hard to believe.  You know, I don't trust anybody.  You know, you know, you know, you know.  Is it the truth? 
[00:16:30]  I don't know.  It's a great production.  It's great.  It's great.  That's silly D-boy.  That's silly D-boy.  Is that it again?  There's a little bit of resentment in there.  No.  A little.  Never.  A tiny bit.  No.  Okay, I'm getting some.  Eric, how long is the Gene Simmons clip?  Gene Simmons is 11 minutes.  Okay, we're going to play that.  This is Gene Simmons' last time he was on O&A.  This was his final appearance.  He made sort of an offhanded comment about Ant's then-girlfriend, Jill Nicolini, at the time. 
[00:17:00]  Ant later found out.  I think it might have even been later that day.  If not, it was the next day that Gene Simmons had come close to sexually assaulting Jill Nicolini at WPIX when he was over there doing the news broadcast.  And so Ant took umbrage with the fact that Gene was poking him a little bit, but Ant didn't know why he was doing it.  So he felt like Gene was making him out to be an asshole.  So this was the beginning.  And this also includes the small clip we played earlier, yeah, of Danny having his hand stopped on the keyboard by Gene Simmons. 
[00:17:30]  But this was it, the end of the Gene Simmons relationship on Opie and Anthony.  In honor of the completely faked tension between Gene and his wife, this is Gene's last appearance right here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  There's Gene.  Hello, gentlemen, and I use the term lightly.  Oh, yeah.  That's going to hurt us. 
[00:18:00]  That's not good.  I don't really consider myself a gentleman.  The great Gene Simmons.  How are you, sir?  You know, I'm deliriously happy, I'm sure you can tell.  Yes.  Why are you happy?  I get to be me another day.  How about you?  I'm happy to be me.  Yes.  We're happy just to be near you.  So what's all this trash I hear you're talking about when I'm not here?  You know, the cowardly thing to do.  Why don't you just say it to my face?  Which thing?  Something about, I don't care about, KISS fans and all this stuff.  Because, you know, I have eyes and ears.  Ooh.  No, I think we took a call or two. 
[00:18:30]  Yes.  And?  And they think that you might market the KISS stuff a little too much.  Good.  And their choice living in the capitalist system is, don't buy it.  Why are you looking at me?  Because we work here.  Don't be a whining bitch.  You know, if you don't like what's going on, switch the channel.  Don't buy it.  Somebody can complain all they want about anything.  But the power of the purse is the biggest power.  Somebody doesn't like something.  Some people, though, would say that that isn't always the case. 
[00:19:00]  That there's some kind of a loyalty or...  They're not qualified to make that assessment.  Brand dignity or things like that.  Says who?  I'm just saying there are...  You have to consider the source.  Everybody's got an opinion.  And everybody's opinion is worth one opinion.  By the way, this content that you're videoing is for whom?  For the website.  Is that okay, Gene?  Would you like to ask me first?  Hold on.  This is the second time Gene's been in.  And the first time he was in, he asked if somebody would ask him.  And then how come we're filming, at least without the courtesy of asking the second time?  See that? 
[00:19:30]  Now you know why he was on my roast and you weren't.  Oh.  But not for real.  It's like that would save us the...  Somebody is supposed to clear...  It's common curve.  Not me.  Okay.  Yeah.  That's not somebody.  It's like when you...  I'm not a lawyer.  Yeah.  Before you stick it in, you say, may I?  Would you mind if we video you?  I don't.  Thank you very much.  Now, how come...  Look.  Let me tell you you've got a little one here.  What?  What's the...  It's Jimmy's banana.  Yeah.  And of course he's got a little pussy in his lap, which I'm sure you've already done  ten jokes about that.  No.  Actually, we've sworn off pussy jokes because we thought they were kind of, you know, hacky. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Because you're tired of paying the FCC money.  No.  Over here?  We just say, you know...  You can say whatever the hell you want.  It's called a pussy, not a cunt.  Right.  So we can pretty much say whatever we want.  Yeah.  You're hurting me.  Yeah.  So isn't it a fantastic book?  Well, not yes, and I want to know a little bit about this.  Not yes.  Not yes.  No, not yes?  That's what you said.  Not yes.  Did I?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, let me describe it.  Well, yes.  But I also have a few questions. 
[00:20:30]  Well, let me tell you about the book first, because that's more important.  All right.  It's a book called Ladies of the Night, written by my favorite person, Gene Simmons.  It's a historic, or historical, take your pick, overview of the oldest profession in  the world.  It is a coffee table book, in the sense that you can put it on your coffee table, and everybody  will have lots to say about it.  Gold-tipped, gold-trim.  I mean, it's really a high-end book.  Very much sort of an arthouse book.  And the reason for that is, I think the oldest profession in the world hasn't gotten a fair 
[00:21:00]  shake, as it were, from the courtesans of Europe's Renaissance period, to the geishas  of Japan, to even the New Testament in Mary Magdalene.  This has been a time-honored tradition, and has been relegated to the dark side.  If you go to page 52, I'll show you something astonishing.  Oh, it's like a workbook.  It's just fun.  Yeah.  This is a psalm and verse.  Page 52. 
[00:21:30]  Page 52.  When you go to page 52, you'll see when you entered the brothels of Rome, you actually  used those coins.  Oh.  Describe them.  Well, I see sexual positions.  That's right.  On the coins, with various Roman numeral denominations.  That's exactly what it was.  And so you'd go into the brothels of Rome, and you'd give them the equivalent of the denomination,  and you'd give them either your slave, or fur skin, or whatever it was that you exchanged  for it, they would give you these coins that were only good in the houses of ill repute. 
[00:22:00]  And then on the other side, because most of the masses were illiterate, it actually depicted  what it was you were buying.  Oh, so that's obviously a blowjob.  Doggy style.  Doggy.  Yeah.  And then this one, I don't know what that, what the fuck is that one?  Looks like it's just kind of holding your ass.  That was a Passover dinner.  You're cordially invited.  They don't let you talk?  Oh no, I've just been enjoying this cat very much. 
[00:22:30]  Jimmy is a cat lover.  Did you have a good time at the roast?  I really did, it was great.  Yeah.  Boy, they drilled me a new asshole.  Yeah, that's what the roasts are all about.  I hear Jimmy did very well, though.  That's good.  Gene sent me a very nice Christmas gift, too.  It was a, yeah, it was an iPod tower and a handwritten note.  It was really great.  I meant to thank you for that.  That's very nice.  Yeah.  Don't ruin it.  They're going to have, you're going to leave them nothing to talk about.  Badass holes, a money-grubbing son of a, yeah.  So, you're right.  Money-grubbing son of a, yeah. 
[00:23:00]  No, you're right.  We just came back from the European leg of our world tour.  We're playing 30 stadiums and arenas from Stockholm Stadium, which sold out in 20 minutes, and Helsinki and everything else.  And we're only doing four shows in America, one at the foot of Mount Rushmore, for hundreds of thousands of people, literally.  It's Sturgis, the bike rally.  They're going to have 400,000 to 500,000 people there.  And we're going to literally inform the local airports, it's not even a joke, to keep their low-flying planes away from the area, because our fireworks are hundreds of feet high into the air. 
[00:23:30]  So, it's dangerous for the locals.  I don't want any mishaps.  So, you can imagine, and we'll play some songs.  Yeah, well, I would hope so, if people are going to see KISS, that they would want to see.  Yeah, but if it's just some guy going, here's my second song, here's an acoustic version, get out of here.  Blow some stuff.  You want the whole thing.  Yeah.  The whole show.  Only four shows, though, in the States, huh?  Yeah, because we don't have time.  Paul's doing some art show stuff. 
[00:24:00]  His artwork is really exploding.  We've got our fourth season of Gene Simmons' Family Jewels that we'll start filming in August.  Third season of 34 new episodes is running now.  And I started another television show, which I can't talk about except to say that, which will be done, finished by the end of August.  And the IndyCar series is running.  And as you know, our Simmons Abramson Marketing does the branding marketing for the IndyCar series, including the Indy 500. 
[00:24:30]  And just an awful lot of stuff.  And Ladies of the Night.  Yes.  My newest book.  The other two, by the way, were New York Times and LA Times bestsellers.  I have to ask you, what type of research did you do on this?  You know what?  Sorry, is it for me?  Yeah, it is.  Okay, go on.  No, go ahead.  Take it.  I don't want to interrupt anything.  Go ahead.  No, come on.  Please.  Take it.  Who is it from?  We're all dying to know.  It wasn't a sound effect for me.  Come on, who was it? 
[00:25:00]  He's not the boss?  No, I don't know.  Our old boss isn't with us anymore.  Yeah.  He left yesterday.  So what it was, was we've all kind of been fascinated by the whole thing.  Here I am playing with Jim's banana.  Yeah.  He loves it.  Yeah.  I can.  It's been used.  The idea has always fascinated me.  And because America is a remnant of the Puritan ethic, I think it's been relegated to the shadows.  When the truth is, from Spitzer all the way down to the lowest crack whore, there is that business that goes on and on. 
[00:25:30]  And it seems to me in Europe they have less of a problem with it.  Because when Mitterrand, the head of France at the time, passed away, not only did his wife show up at his funeral, but also his mistresses.  And nobody batted an eyelash.  And so I think what I'd like to do is to engage people in the conversation.  I'm not an advocacy group.  This is more a historical overview.  That's just it.  It's a historical overview.  How did you research for it? 
[00:26:00]  Did you just decide?  Is this knowledge you had?  Or did you have to kind of...  I'm fairly well read, but you do have to refer to the Internet.  And libraries are a godsend, as far as I'm concerned.  They're the house of God.  And Julie McCarron, who works at Phoenix, my co-venture partner for Simmons Books, did almost all the research.  That includes scouring the museums of Europe and Asia and so on and so forth. 
[00:26:30]  It's too easy to look at the Kama Sutra and take all the sexual positions, because this book ain't about sex.  It's about women throughout history who decided to empower themselves whether society agreed.  After ONA Live.  The guy just goes on and on and on.  At some point, you just got to cut him off.  And luckily, through the magic of pre-taping something, we have access to do that here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  In hindsight, not a huge surprise that that was his last appearance.  A bit of a tense interview, Iraq. 
[00:27:00]  At the beginning of this clip and the full interview, he walks in and they're saying, hey, Gene Simmons.  He goes, gentlemen, if I can call you that or call you that loosely or something like that.  He walked in automatically with a fucking attitude.  Well, nobody likes that.  Not all interviews go that poorly, though.  For instance, Who Kid.  I just walked into the bathroom while that was playing.  Yeah.  And Who Kid was getting the mob wives' phone numbers.  I don't know what happened in his interview with them, but he was getting the phone numbers from the mob wives.  He was flirting with them.  He was on his game and they left here laughing. 
[00:27:30]  So, you know.  He loves the reality TV.  Well, and he loves the ladies.  He was going to come on here, but right now he's interviewing Sam Champion.  So, I mean.  The weather guy?  Yes.  He will interview.  Who Kid from Shade 45 will interview anybody who you put in front of him.  That's not to say I'm not that big of a whore as well, but we're talking about Who Kid.  Listen, we could talk about people all day long, but we've got to take a hotline call real quick. 
[00:28:00]  Hello?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus Christ on a cross.  What's wrong?  What the fuck was that Gene Simmons thing?  It was the last Gene Simmons interview, Ant.  Yeah, but wasn't that supposed to be like the whole thing with, I guess, Jill?  I heard you set it up, and it sounded like it was going to go somewhere.  And it was just what you actually played was a shitty Gene Simmons interview. 
[00:28:30]  Well.  With him plugging his fucking book, his band, his fucking bullshit book company, his IndyCar crap,  his pseudo-gay lead singer's artwork, what the fuck, it didn't get to the meat and potatoes of it,  because he wouldn't shut the fuck up.  So your problem was with the content, the section that was played, correct?  That stunk.  Then I will forward you to Eric Nagel, who's in charge of cutting up the clips for this show. 
[00:29:00]  Eric Nagel.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I was just wondering about that.  Like, why was that?  Well, Eric, I guess he's not answering, but he gets a little lazy sometimes, so I think  he just cuts it off.  Oh, he didn't know that.  Wait, wait.  See, I could understand playing that a little further into the shitty interview when it  got to the part where we're kind of yelling about how...  Oh, wait.  Hold on, a cop.  Oh, boy. 
[00:29:30]  I hope he didn't see me talking on the telephone.  Me, too.  Oh, no, I don't think he did.  Heaven forbid.  Yes.  Yeah, what happened to the part where, like, Gene says, well, how about I fuck your girlfriend?  Eric, well, I asked you for the Nicolini part and the Danny part, and the interview was  over an hour long, and I was trying to piece all of it together.  Right.  That would be the kind of interesting part, because just Gene talking and slathering on 
[00:30:00]  about his products is a bore fest.  You could have just given us the five minutes where he's talking about Jill Nicolini instead  of ten minutes of him talking about his book, to be fair, Eric.  Very good.  That's exactly what I meant.  Eric?  All right.  Eric, comment?  My bad.  Comment?  Nagel?  Nagel.  Comment?  Comment?  All right.  Well, now you know why I switched away.  I went to fucking 1010 Winds.  Well, I'm glad you're here to police this thing, Ant, because Eric won't listen to me.  He won't look at me with any respect. 
[00:30:30]  Well, I'll tell you.  You better get on the stick.  I will.  Get on the ball, young man.  And Eric, now you know we're being serious.  I know why.  It's called the shit hour.  All right.  Goodbye.  All right.  Bye, Ant.  As we're trying to leave, Bob Kelly, we got to go.  It's right.  We're running into Ryan Fest time.  You suck.  Is that it?  Yeah.  All right.  See you tomorrow.  Hit the sleeper!  Opie and Anthony's show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.
