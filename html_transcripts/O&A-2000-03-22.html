<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between segments.  It began with Opie recounting a humorous traffic stop where he was initially cited for a brake light, only to be later discovered to have a suspended license due to an unpaid seatbelt ticket. He described a near-escape attempt and ultimately receiving a warning after the officers recognized him.

The conversation then shifted to Celine Dion's retirement, with the hosts mocking a letter from a cancer patient deeply moved by her music.  Opie proceeded with a lengthy, sexually explicit impersonation of Celine Dion, filled with crude jokes about his genitalia and comparisons to the Titanic.  This was followed by a call with Yoshi, a Chinese food delivery person, who claimed to sell a "Chinese Viagra" containing pork ("Po") as a secret ingredient.  The conversation was laced with Yoshi's heavily accented English and sexually suggestive remarks.

Next, the show discussed a news interruption caused by a man named Mark during a live broadcast.  This transitioned into a comedic bit about Ted Williams falling asleep during a Tom Brokaw interview, with audio of the snoring and Brokaw's attempts to continue the interview being played.  More impersonations and commentary followed.  A gay listener, Don, called in, initially offended by jokes about Ricky Martin's sexuality, leading to a discussion about the hosts' views on homosexuality, filled with sexually explicit jokes and banter, culminating in the hosts jokingly declaring themselves gay.  The show also included a discussion of upcoming guests.

A separate segment opened with the hosts and a studio guest examining and joking about a sex doll, discussing its features and including a microwave use disclaimer.  This led to a discussion of sexually suggestive topics and items, including chocolate penises.  Caller Tamah questioned Opie about his dating preferences, sparking a discussion about his racial preferences and humor.  The “Reverendow,” a recurring character, briefly interrupted to express mock outrage.  Opie then recounted a prolonged, comedic anecdote about his reluctant pumpkin-picking trip with his girlfriend, Sandy, who later called in to corroborate and expand on the story. Numerous callers joined in to tease Opie.  The segment included an in-studio guest appearance by Adam Ferrara, who discussed being bumped from a David Letterman appearance, his early musical career, and various misadventures. Listener calls followed, some sharing experiences at daytime strip clubs, and the broadcast included Stephen Lynch's song "Kill a Kitten."

Another significant portion of the show focused on strip clubs, with the hosts reminiscing about Long Island establishments (Brass Monkey, Carousel, Voyage Inn) and detailing their experiences.  Caller Joe shared similar stories about "skanky bars" in Paterson, New Jersey. The conversation included explicit descriptions of the clubs and unconventional acts like the "rug act."  A game ensued where Opie and Anthony guessed callers' races based on their voices, leading to discussions about racial stereotypes and accents.  A discussion about rape, sparked by a biologist's claim that it's biologically ingrained in men, followed, becoming contentious with callers and Mike Tyson joining the conversation, contributing aggressively with offensive and sexually explicit statements. Several female callers expressed discomfort.  The segment concluded with further discussion and disagreement, briefly returning to a previously aired segment about a botched Star Wars promotional stunt.

The final excerpt detailed Opie's frustrating DMV trips to register his vehicle and his attempts to obtain a car title with only 70 cents.  The major portion of this segment involved a punishment inflicted on a female guest, "Christian," from Oklahoma, for not appearing topless and bringing beer as promised. The punishment involved producer Rick forcing her to watch a video of a 100-year-old woman having sex while restraining her.  The hosts and callers discussed Rick's behavior, Christian’s actions, and the video.  The show concluded with a call-in game, "Make Bridget Cry," involving sexually suggestive and insulting remarks aimed at upsetting a caller, Bridget, who had previously called in for relationship advice.  Snippets of a phone sex advertisement for "Tourette Whorehouse" and the song "The Wow Song" were also played.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Worst of Opie and Anthony, 107 W.A.W.  Yeah, I almost didn't make it in.  What do you mean you didn't almost make it in?  Very close.  Well, I was on my way in.  Tell me you got pulled over again.  Again?  I know, I'm like Rodney King these days.  Jesus, you're way in the lead.  We used to have a competition to see who could get pulled over the most. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, but as far as getting tickets, you're still in the lead.  I talk my way out of it.  I just don't drive anymore, so I'm saving myself a lot of money.  I'm driving down Broadway, you know, a black car with the light and the windshield pulls me over.  Dad, pull the truck out of the back.  Pull the truck out of the back.  How close to work were you?  Very close.  Like a block or two?  Yeah, I was going to stop at the back.  Why do we always get pulled over right around our neighborhood? 
[00:01:00]  I was going to stop at the bank real quick, you know, and do some banking.  So I was kind of waiting for the, I wasn't even going to double park.  But, get this, I was waiting for one of the cars to leave so I wouldn't have to double park while I went into the bank.  So I was sitting there.  I'm like, oh, what did I do?  All right.  He says that you got a brake light out.  I guess I did. 
[00:01:30]  I didn't know.  I mean, I'm very grateful if an officer points that out to me.  What a kiss.  So I, shut up.  I could have been in jail.  Shut up.  So I could have used a day off.  We have a new policy.  One of us is sick or in jail.  The other guy doesn't have to work.  Do you know what the hell would happen if I was in jail and the listeners find out the barrage of abuse I get?  Forget about it, man. 
[00:02:00]  Bubba would love you in jail, too.  I don't think I'd be going to that jail.  I don't think they send you to that jail.  You never know.  Don't worry.  A mix-up, you're saying, maybe, before you know it.  I'm the queen of the weight room prom.  I get pulled over.  Okay.  Break my license.  Sure, go ahead.  Give him my license, which is still a mass license.  Jesus Christ, I've got to get this straightened out.  With mass plates, too, right?  Yeah.  He says that's another reason they pull people over.  He goes, you know, you get an out-of-state plate here in the city, 
[00:02:30]  figuring you're out-of-state to get new plates because you've got a problem here in New York.  So, you know, they run my license.  He comes back.  He got a suspended license.  Like, what?  No, I pay my tickets.  I know you hear that all the time, but, you know, I paid my tickets.  There's not a December you got a ticket and suspended your license.  Yeah, okay.  Very funny, Opie.  So, you guys are really funny. 
[00:03:00]  So, I said I paid it.  He goes, no, didn't pay it.  You're going to have to come with us down to the precinct.  I'm like, oh, no.  Oh, I'm going to jail.  Oh, no.  This isn't happening.  Wait a minute.  I almost got away from those chicks when they try to handcuff us here in the studio.  Maybe I could get away from these two big guys.  Yeah, sure.  And I'm looking at two uniformed guys on the sidewalk.  I'm like, if I make a run for it, I could probably disappear into Times Square. 
[00:03:30]  They'd never find me.  Oh, sure.  I'd be face first before I even pass my wheel well.  I'd be, like, in the pavement.  Why are you wearing a White Feeder t-shirt today, Andy?  I didn't do nothing.  You didn't see any kiddie pools on the streets of Manhattan to hide under?  F you.  Yeah.  I should have hid.  I should have ran.  I should have been banging his head against the window.  Yeah.  I'd be in the police car, the backseat handcuffed, banging my head against the window trying to get out. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, you effing cops, man.  You want to go to work?  I got to go to work.  I said, but then I have to play the car, don't you?  At that point, it's like, it's not just getting out of ticket.  I'm going to jail.  Right.  So I go, oh, I can't go to jails now.  I'm on the air in a half hour.  I'm on the air.  On the Opie and Anthony show, on the air radio, N-E-W. 
[00:04:30]  Thank God one of the guys knew who I was, you know?  Yeah.  I know those guys.  Yeah.  Well, so they say, well, they quiz me a little bit about my license, date of birth, where I went.  I guess they were from the island because they were quizzing me about Huntington, what school I went to, what year, blah, blah, blah, the whole thing.  He goes, all right, well, you better get this taken care of.  You know, some guy, you know, might pull you over and really arrest you.  He's like, oh, thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you.  But he goes, you better mention this on the air.  At two o'clock.  Because if you, uh, if this isn't you, because they didn't know.  He goes, how could you prove that it's you?  You know, what am I supposed to do?  Go break into my Dyson presence?  Hey, officer, huh?  Hey, you should have done some of your voices.  All right.  You pulled me over, huh?  What's the matter?  Slow day?  Huh?  Where's the crackheads?  All right.  You know, I didn't want to get into that. 
[00:05:30]  But, uh, oh, mucho appreciado, officer.  And then I find out, because I come to the station, and I try to resolve the problem as quickly as possible, officer.  Smart guy.  I call up motor vehicle.  They punch up the ticket.  You actually got through?  Yeah.  I know.  That's a miracle in itself.  So, I, uh, they punch up the ticket.  It was that seatbelt ticket I got in December, remember?  That we talked about.  Yeah.  I paid the $45 that it said to pay. 
[00:06:00]  $55.  For $10, I'm ready to get hauled in.  So, now I got to go to motor vehicle and pay the $10 that are left.  But, probably now it's $110, because I didn't pay it.  But, uh, oh, and I can't, now my what?  I can't drive.  I can't drive until I get this taken care of.  Oh, yeah.  If I get pulled over, I'm screwed, and I got a brake light out.  I might as well just down a fifth of jack on my way home, too.  Like, you're not driving home to Brooklyn tonight. 
[00:06:30]  Who are you kidding?  Dude, thank God they didn't see the kilo of coke in the back.  Shut up.  Oh, my God.  It was, like, right underneath the, uh, carpet in the back.  Kilo of blow.  And the dead hooker beneath the, uh, the back seat.  Well, the shovel should have gave us, gave that away.  I was kicking it away with my foot.  You could smell dead hooker on the whole vehicle.  I was amazed.  You gotta get the secret compartments like the rep guys.  I need the trap.  The trap.  The trap.  The trap like Puffy.  It needs a trap. 
[00:07:00]  Trap.  And you know me, you know, the way I look and stuff.  I'm, I'm reaching for my, uh, glove compartment to get the Reggie, and I got, like, both hands up.  Hello?  Not going for a weapon.  Don't worry.  Watch.  I could take my wallet out without my hands.  So we gotta, uh, we gotta thank New York's, uh, Finest.  Yeah, thanks, guys.  That was pretty cool.  You know, they could have brought me in and stuff.  Because if it wasn't for them, uh, we would not have a radio show today.  That's the truth.  No.  Yeah.  God, I would have laughed my balls off if at 2.20, when we had to go on the air. 
[00:07:30]  I'd call up.  You'd call up from, like, to join your, your one phone call?  I know.  Wouldn't that be great?  Um, Opie?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, what's up?  Not much.  Um.  You want me to check your stocks for you?  No.  No?  Um.  You usually call this time to check your stocks.  Hope, I'm in jail.  I got locked up.  But, uh, woof.  All right.  I dodged the bullet.  Almost felt like old dirty.  Oh, what?  Oh, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:08:00]  That doesn't sound so bad.  Booyah!  Sucks, man, from wall to wall.  Booyah!  1027 WNEW.  Yoshi, what do you order?  Yoshi!  Very busy.  Uh, what do you order?

No, I'm not calling for an order.  You, uh, you want the company?

Well, it's a natural herb, right?  Yes, very natural.  From ancient Chinese secret.  Oh, I see.  Yes, it contains a ginseng, tang fang, cowlok, fang rang, winged fang, and special secret ingredient.

[00:12:00]  What are you trying?  How about that?  Hey, there's a man who pedals into danger.  If you eat Chinese food, this guy's no stranger.  He's weeping down the block.  I want you on a beef or pork.  The man will risk his life to bring you a rose.  Little Asian man. 
[00:12:30]  Little Asian man.  He may just get run over while bringing you love me.  His back's a piece of crap.  His basket's rusted.  That's the one-go-so.  The seat is wrapped in tape.  The brakes are busted.  He used his shoes to stop. 
[00:13:00]  That's when he hit that cop.  He still finds bits of rice inside his holster.  Little Asian man.  Little Asian man.  He may just get run over while bringing you love me.  Out of the way, Master River.  You, that's where you go.  You, you almost hit the ocean. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, no, out of the way.  Oh, please get out of the way.  Don't want to hurt you.  And now, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Well, what's up, Anthony?  Hey, man.  The ONA show.  Yes, it is.  It's a great day, Anthony. 
[00:14:00]  Beautiful day.  We were talking about this yesterday.  Celine Dion, she's retiring.  Stop.  Let me talk about it.  I should all show up.  Yes, Celine.  Which is a complete joke.  She's going to go away for two years.  And then she's going to come back.  She's going to be bigger and better than ever for all those fat housewives.  Her big comeback.  She'll have her big comeback.  She's not retiring forever.  She's too young.  There's nothing else she's going to do.  No.  She's going to try to start a family. 
[00:14:30]  Man, she'll be back.  So Oprah Winfrey made a huge deal about this.  Oh.  Oh.  Stop.  Was it yesterday?  On yesterday's show, they had Celine Dion.  Oh.  I hate this song, man.  This is dedicated to the people of the Titanic.  All of those who perished.  The icy waters of the North Atlantic. 
[00:15:00]  I send this song out to all the people.  And to the survivors.  Those who were able to live on with their lives after the great ship went down.  You stole another bit from me, you bastard.  Yeah, that's all being bad.  I used to do that one.  I don't do many.  Come on.  The brave people who could survive the icy waters of the North Atlantic.  In their boats, watching the mighty Titanic slowly slip beneath the surface of the water. 
[00:15:30]  This song goes out to them.  The survivors.  Of course.  Anyway.  But she sings perfectly.  What a tool.  Her voice is all effed up, but she sings perfectly.  Yeah.  Perfect English.  Listen to her.  Anyway, do we have the letter from the Oprah Winfrey show?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, where is it?  Please.  So here it is.  It was a tear fest on Oprah yesterday. 
[00:16:00]  And they read this letter from this guy.  Well, we're going to mock this guy.  So I want to say in advance that he's okay now.  Yeah, he's okay.  It's just, I mean, I don't care what you got.  I'm sorry about that.  But you sound like the biggest pussy in the world.  This guy does sound like the biggest pussy in the world.  And during the cry fest, they had this guy read his letter that he sent to Celine.  We've received a lot of mail from viewers who've been moved by Celine's music.  Brian Kloos was watching our show the last time Celine was here and wrote us this letter. 
[00:16:30]  Take a look.  Dear Oprah, I'm sitting in my hospital room going through a bone marrow transplant for lymphoma.  I'm a grown man crying after watching Celine Dion sing the theme to Titanic on your show.  I heard about Celine in one of your previous shows and fell in love with her music, voice, and great attitude for life and family. 
[00:17:00]  And camel toe.  At that time, I was just diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  Hearing Celine sing some of her songs had me bawling.  Her song, Because You Loved Me, couldn't have hit home more perfectly about the way I feel about my wife, Kathy.  Listening to the song, wasn't sure where my future was going, how I was going to survive it, the canceling and fight it and things like that.  It just really hit home.  After the show, I went right out and bought the CD and gave it to my wife. 
[00:17:30]  To this day, Kathy and I can't listen to the song, Because You Loved Me, without crying.  It was a strong, loving woman, this special, special lady in my life.  My heart and soul couldn't imagine a day without her.  She's everything to me.  Ryan and Kathy, we thought your letter was sweet.  We wanted to do something special for you.  So, you're going to her final performance. 
[00:18:00]  Listen to Oprah.  I am so happy for you guys.  Thank you.  Oh, the way.  I love you.  I love you.  What's going on?  What's going on? 
[00:18:30]  You're going to be there for the final performance.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  That's great stuff.  That's great stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  You know, I've got to jump in here.  God forbid I was, you know, at a cancer scare, Anthony.  God forbid, really.  And, you know, like this guy, he decided he needs to go see Celine Dion.  Yeah.  You know what would be better than that? 
[00:19:00]  Being able to watch Oprah at Sunday brunch.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what you want to say.  Oh, if I had my choice.  If I had my choice, Anthony.  Went through all the chemo, you know.  My hair has been patches all over my head.  Oh.  Am I going to see Celine Dion sing the Titanic song?  No.  I want to see Oprah Winfrey at Sunday brunch.  That's when I know Oprah cares. 
[00:19:30]  I want to see Celine.  Jesus.  Oh, more Celine.  I don't want...  He's sensitive.  I want to be home and do some cooking and stay home and have no schedule and no pressure and say, let's go for a picnic and drive my own car and pick my own tomatoes.  Pick my own tomatoes and give myself a frontal wedgie every day.  It looks like I have ass in the front. 
[00:20:00]  Buy some new yo-yos for the front of my pants.  My pants sink deeper than the Titanic in the front.  A crevice in the front when I wear my jump pants that is deeper than the crevice made by the iceberg in the mighty bow of the Titanic.  It actually looks like I was straddling the iceberg and the bow of the Titanic struck me right in my camel toe.  That's what made this big gully when I wear my tight jumpsuit. 
[00:20:30]  You see my tight jumpsuit and my pelvis bones that jet out?  I am the iceberg.  The Titanic slammed into my crotch at approximately 12 knots.  The man in the crow's nest yelled,  Hamilton, dead ahead.  But the mighty Titanic could not stop.  It hit my groin at 12 knots,  ripping open many watertight compartments  and leaving me with a hatchet wound unlike no other. 
[00:21:00]  This goes out to the survivors  who before they sank,  before they got into their lifeboats,  were able to take one last look  in the lights of the distress flares  and see my camel toe.  The camel toe that brought down the mighty Titanic on her maiden voyage.  Can you believe it? 
[00:21:30]  Who thought a gas could bring down a mighty ocean liner like the Titanic?  They called it unsinkable.  Selene, how many people lost their lives in your crotch?  I believe it was 750 people died 
[00:22:00]  because of my camel toe.  If you look,  some nights when I am in concert with my tight jumpsuit,  you can see on each thigh,  HMS Titanic  and anchor wounds.  Now I know why Leonardo DiCaprio's face was blue.  It was from the smell.  Hold on, Jack! 
[00:22:30]  The ship thought unsinkable and iceberg-proof  not to be camel toe-proof.  The yo-yo I smuggled could take down the Queen Mary.  But that goes out to the survivors.  Those who were able to live on  and make their dreams come true  and get the nightmarish image  of my groin out of their head forever.  I'm quitting show business. 
[00:23:00]  Uh, Fred!  Anthony has a serious future  as a Selene Dion impersonator.  When you say the words,  survivor.  This song is dedicated to  the Titanic  and its fearless crew  and passengers.  Not just those that perished  in the icy waters of the North Atlantic,  but also  to the survivors. 
[00:23:30]  Excellent.  All right, Fred.  That's funny.  God damn it,  is that funny, man?  I don't even care  if anyone else is laughing.  That is,  that's some top shelf stuff  right there, man.  That is,  that's where it's at.  All right,  because of that  Selene Dion bit,  yes,  that went on for 20 minutes.  We have to go to commercials again. 
[00:24:00]  A commercial break.  We apologize.  I am not going to sing anymore.  Opie,  Anthony,  if I may just  cut in for a moment.  Yeah.  Of course,  you know,  I am ending my singing career.  Yeah.  I have made people  very happy with my voice,  but I am stopping  for a time  so I may do other things.  These things that I am doing  will help people also.  I am going to be hired  by the  National Baseball Association. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, yeah?  Why?  Yes.  Baseball will need me  to model the new  catcher's mitt  out of,  out of my private area,  because it looks like  I have a catcher's mitt  down the front  of my jumpsuit.  And, of course,  look for me  at high schools  as the bicycle rack.  I will be appearing  on the next Fox special  with Robbie Knievel.  Oh, really?  Yes,  he is going to jump  my mighty hatchet wound. 
[00:25:00]  You've seen him  many times  try to jump  school buses  and whatnot.  Yeah.  This is the most  dangerous jump  of them all.  I believe it would be  a brand new world record.  Yes,  from labia to labia.  Okay,  thank you.  Very difficult.  All right,  thank you, Celine.  And I will be doing  a new movie.  A new movie, huh?  Yes.  Celine will be  in the new Batman movie.  Oh, yeah?  My genitals will be  the new Batcave.  Shut up! 
[00:25:30]  Shut up!  Turn it off!  Turn it off!  Turn it off!  Oh, brother.  Oh, brother.  It will work  to both in Anthony.  Marks!  Is that the movie?  Is that the movie?  I can't believe that 
[00:26:00]  the movie.  It's 107-2021-EW.  He can't seem to stay  out of the way.  We got Channel 2 News on.  Got a megaphone  and something to say.  There's Mark.  There's Mark.  Causing trouble  on CBS 2.  The hugest wow sign.  Masha Kramer  is a tight-ass crew.  This is like,  you know,  I can see big  Tycho mom.  He's a freak.  There he is!  It's a huge wow sign!  Move over!  Move over!  Move over!  Move over!  Yeah! 
[00:26:30]  What is this?  We're all in the middle.  Mark, you're all in the middle.  What happened, Mark?  What happened, Mark?  I'm CBS 2.  You're something for me.  You look like  a stock-raising lunatic.  That was classic.  Mark can't be doing that.  What the hell are you, Mark?  You're interrupting  our own news broadcast.  For God's sake. 
[00:27:00]  You know we're going to get  in trouble by the company.  Yeah, I know.  Take on my heart.  He's a freak.  Just whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out!  Whip them out!  Whip them out!  Whip them out!  Whip them out!  Mark's a face.  She's so mad at me.  You tell her  go to our boss.  No, I'm not.  I'm just hanging out.  If you should be allowed  to do your job,  I should be allowed  to do your job.  I almost pissed  in my pants.  That was the funniest thing 
[00:27:30]  I've seen  in a very, very long time.  Mark, I got one question  for you.  Yeah.  How do you walk around  with that set, you guys?  What do you, like,  walk around like  John Wayne?  Wayne, like...  Yeah.  I just want to know, guys,  when is the farewell show  going to be?  That's why you're  going to listen every day.  This could be it  right here today.  You never know.  It's the worst  of Obi and Anthony.  So pay attention, asshole.  1027 WNEW. 
[00:28:00]  Tom Brokaw  filling in for  Matt Lauer  on the Today Show.  Mm-hmm.  And the story goes  they had Ted Williams  on, what,  via satellite?  Yeah.  From home in Florida  or wherever he's living now?  Yeah.  And, you know,  they were getting  his comments  about Joe DiMaggio,  his career  and his life and stuff.  Because Yogi  was busy that day.  Mm-hmm.  Like, Yogi  made the rounds  to every show  talking about it.  But they got Ted.  Yep.  And then, I guess,  they talked to Ted 
[00:28:30]  for a few minutes  and then they had  Bob Costas on the couch  and they were talking  to Bob.  And they go back  to Ted Williams twice  and he was out cold.  They put the camera  back on him  and he's just sleeping.  Is that horrible?  You know,  to his credit, though,  it was Tom Brokaw.  So maybe he lulled him  to sleep with his  just boredom.  You think?  That might be it.  His boring,  monotone rant.  Hello?  Yeah.  Tom Brokaw,  NBC United,  and here's  how are you, boy? 
[00:29:00]  Good.  Well, I'm getting  a lot of press today  and I'm making  the circuit  to all the shows  because of my  exclusive interview  with Ted Williams.  baseball great  Ted Williams.  Tom, Tom, Tom.  You're filling in  for Matt Lauer  on the Today Show.  I must say.  Matt, Matt,  Lauer.  Yes, I'm filling in  for Matt Lauer.  Lauer.  Lauer, Lauer, 
[00:29:30]  Lauer, Lauer, Lauer.  Can you say  Katie Couric?  Katie Couric.  Katie Couric  and Matt Lauer.  Tom Brokaw,  I'm going to say  that way.  I'm filling in  for Matt Lauer.  Matt Lauer.  Matt Lauer.  That's what I said.  All right.  Well, yeah,  everyone's talking  about your interview  with Ted Williams.  Exclusive interview  with Ted Williams.  Yes.  Speaking about  the great  Joe's mouthful.  Well, it wasn't 
[00:30:00]  an exclusive  because you had...  Exclusive.  It wasn't exclusive  because you had him  on the show this morning.  It was an exclusive,  big, huge story  because Ted Williams  fell asleep  while you were  talking to him today.  I don't understand  why Ted would  doze in the middle  of an interview  with me,  Tom Brokaw,  from NBC  and Nightly News.  You put a lot  of people to sleep  with that voice, Tom.  Yes, sometimes  as I'm speaking,  I even...  Here's my... 
[00:30:30]  Tom, Tom.  Tom Brokaw,  I'm going to say  Nightly News.  Hello.  Why do you sound  extra drowsy today?  Well, I was  taking a ferry  over to the office  today and  a little drammamine  made me drowsy.  But yes,  I was speaking  with Ted Williams.  Ted Williams.  William.  Williams.  And he fell asleep  during my interview.  Yeah, it was 
[00:31:00]  a nap fest yesterday.  Yes, I was.  And there's a  pretty funny picture  of Ted Williams  asleep in the post  today.  It wasn't too funny  when you're doing  the interview  to glance over  at the monitor  and see Ted Williams  roaring  as I am doing  an in-depth interview.  Very articulate,  very unimaginable  interview.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden  I gaze at the monitor  and he's smoothing. 
[00:31:30]  Now, you've been  in this business  a long time.  What do you do  to get out of it?  I mean...  I do what I always do.  I wung it.  You wung it?  I just...  Oh, I break format.  I wing it.  I'm a wild man.  Crazy, kooky,  Tom Broca.  I'm alive for the party.  Now, you had him  on the satellite, right?  Let's get to the bottom  of this story.  You had him  on the satellite.  Yes, he was  at his home.  You had him  on the show  because of Joe DiMaggio? 
[00:32:00]  Talking about  the great number five,  Joe DiMaggio.  Oh, what?  Joe DiMaggio.  Joe DiMaggio.  Yes, the great Yankee  clipper, clipper, clipper.  Clipper.  Cl...  Clipper.  That's what I said.  Clipper, yes.  Clipper.  Okay.  So you're talking to him?  Stop making fun of me.  Via satellite?  Buddy, buddy, Hinton.  Baby talk, baby talk.  It's the one where  you can walk.  Can you do seashells? 
[00:32:30]  By the seashells.  Yes, I was speaking to him  and all of a sudden  I look at the monitor  and he's...  Joe DiMaggio.  Yeah.  How could you fall asleep  with the excitement  of Tom Brokaw  going on  on your monitor at home?  Yeah.  Well, what happened was  you had him on the satellite.  You talked to him  for a little while  then you had Bob Costas  live in the studio, right?  Bob Costas,  a wonderful broadcast.  He's the worst broadcast.  He's a wonderful.  We'll get to that another day.  But anyway,  so you had Costas 
[00:33:00]  on the couch.  You talked to him  for a little while  and then you went back  to Ted Williams  and he was out cold.  Ted Williams was  asleep in the wheel.  All right.  Now, you have the audio  of this.  You want to play  it for our listeners?  Yes, if we could.  Here it is.  Okay.  Ted, we're with you  to speak about your days  with a baseball great  Joe DiMaggio.  How was it to play  baseball with a man  such as Joe DiMaggio,  the great number five, 
[00:33:30]  his 56-game hitting streak  is done beating  Ted.  Ted, if you can just  stir up an answer,  I would be very grateful.  You, of course,  are a teammate.  Yes, it was a little  embarrassing.  Yes, it scares  down to that.  Could you believe  he fell asleep 
[00:34:00]  while facing  the charisma  of Tom Brokaw?  I can't imagine that, Tom.  Our listeners are driving  off the road right now.  Listen to me.  How could anyone  doze as they were  thanks?  Tom, Tom!  Tom.  Hello, Ted Williams.  We're with Ted Williams.  Ted, you were a legend  as was Joe DiMaggio.  Ted, could someone 
[00:34:30]  please tap Ted  on the shoulder?  He seems a little lousy.  Ted, this is  Tom Brokaw  throwing in  for about  an hour  on the today show.  Oh, what a magic.  It was awful  how he fell asleep.  The last time  I was that embarrassed,  as I said,  when Fidel Castro  fell asleep 
[00:35:00]  during an interview  with me  and his fuzzy  little head  fell into  Tom Brokaw's lap  and got stuck  in my zipper.  he woke up  and he thought  he was still  smoking his cigar.  No, that was  no cigar.  I see.  It all started  an international  incident.  Thank God  there were no  photographers in this.  Now, back to  your interview  with Ted Williams.  Ted Williams,  baseball grade. 
[00:35:30]  Ted,  as I recall  back in 1942,  you faced  the old man  Ted,  Ted,  why isn't  Costas waking  Ted?  Ted,  Ted,  we're on the air  live on the  today show  as I fell in  for Matt  the law.  Where's Katie  Clue?  You're right.  Katie Clue 
[00:36:00]  All right,  now Tom,  before you  leave,  you've got to  pronounce the  hardest words  for you to  pronounce.  You may  remember  an episode  of  Leon  Klinghoffer  being flown  overboard  in a terrorist  event on  the ship.  Oh boy,  here it  comes.  The hijacked  cruiser,  the  Achilles  Lone.  The  Achilles 
[00:36:30]  Lone.  Leon  Klinghoffer  on the  Achilles  Lone.  Achilles.  You have a  tough time,  bro?  MBC  Nightly  in here.  You have a  tough time  with the  name  Monica Lewinsky  as well.  Coincidentally  enough,  I sound  much like 
[00:37:00]  Monica did  during the  act.  Monica  Lewin  Loneski.  Boy,  could you  imagine if  Monica Lewinsky  was on the  Achilles  level?  I'd have to  have the  night off.  A lot of  times,  my own  voice  lost.  Now,  Tom,  I got  Tom,  Tom.  Can we  hear a  little more  audio of  your interview  with Ted  Williams?  Yes,  maybe we  can point  out the  part where  he fell  asleep.  All right. 
[00:37:30]  Ted,  you were  a great  player in  the game.  Of course,  you can  elaborate on  playing the  game with  Joe DiMaggio,  rule number  five,  56-game  hitting streak.  Ted,  if you  can  tell  Ted,  you're  dead.  That's  always  Tom,  me.  Tom,  bro,  God,  Emily,  I,  Lynn. 
[00:38:00]  Wow,  he put  him and  Ted to  sleep.  Wow,  very nice.  The  words  of  Opie  and  Anthony  in  1027  WNEW.  All righty,  what's  happening,  everybody?  This is  Rick,  the producer  of the  Opie and  Anthony  show.  The guys,  as you  by well  know by  now,  they are  on vacation  until Monday.  They will  be back  ready to  rock on 
[00:38:30]  Monday.  So in  the meantime,  we're taking  care of the  worst of all  this week.  We've still  got three  awesome days  of worst  of material  to go  through.  If you've  got any  suggestions,  212-757-1027.  Stinky is  manning the  phones.  Or you  can fax it  in at  212-957-WNEW.  Also,  the instant  feedback is  working.  I'm going  through it,  taking your  suggestions off.  We've got  suggestions for  Mike Tyson  coming up  later in the  show,  Adam Ferrara,  Jim Brewer,  Reverend Al,  all on the 
[00:39:00]  way.  In the  meantime,  one of the  guys,  or I should  say,  Opie's  favorite singers,  Ricky Martin,  is the next  topic of  discussion.  So hang  back,  relax,  and get  ready as  we continue  on with  the worst  of Opie  and Anthony.  Today,  you're stuck  with the worst  of Opie  and Anthony.  107-WNEW.  The gays,  we're going to  say Ricky  Martin a little 
[00:39:30]  bit.  Literally,  it seems  like everyone  else has.  This is  you had  it.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Give it  a little  bite.  Yeah.  Flaming home  of  hair  of  shocking  white.  This is  superstition.  This is what?  Like cats and  bullies all.  Rockville  premonition.  That girl's  going to make me  fall.  Girl.  Girl. 
[00:40:00]  You get it.  Get it out.  Get it out.  Get it out.  Get it out.  Get it out.  Get it out.  Get it out.  I got it.  I got it.  Get it out.  She's got a  new future  for every  day and  night.  Make you  take your  girls  on  Hey, Ricky, why are you just pulling your pants down in front of Spaz? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  What?  What?  What?  Livin' la vida homo.  Can we see your stuff? 
[00:41:00]  Can we see your stuff?  Welcome to New York City.  In the funky hotel.  In my heart, in my money.  What's the city of the city of the city?  I'm a joke.  That's the day.  That's the night of the city.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, singin' about girls. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Roll your pants down.  Roll your pants down.  Come on! 
[00:42:00]  You should not lose it.  It's going to make you puke.  Hello, how are you guys?  Thanks for joining us. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, there's a little story about him in a picture in the paper.  Did you see that?  Oh.  There it is.  I got some problems with the story.  Do you?  Yeah, yeah.  I was reading it.  I was thinking, oh, a red flag.  There's a few red flags here.  Now, before we start this, we have no idea whether or not Ricky Martin pounds nails.  I have no idea about his sexual persuasion, but we can speculate whatever we please. 
[00:43:00]  We have no clue.  He's like a robin and likes to pull worms out of the ground.  No idea.  No.  So let's say that right off the top here.  Well, it seems Ricky Martin spent New Year's Day in Miami Beach.  Okay.  That's the first red flag.  Okay.  Okay.  He's in Miami Beach.  And I'm going to count the red flags.  All right.  Miami Beach, New Year's Eve.  One.  Looking like Goldilocks.  Okay. 
[00:43:30]  He bleached his hair.  Bleached his hair.  It's white.  It's not bleach.  How many of your pals do you know, Ant?  It's the new bleach in the pump dispenser.  Okay.  How many of your pals bleached their hair?  Oh, my God.  Let's see.  There was none.  All right.  So that's two.  Yeah.  He dyed his hair.  People are saying.  Oh, his representative.  His little rep people.  He dyed his hair just before Christmas.  Just for fun. 
[00:44:00]  He said for a goof.  You know.  Geeky.  That's what I do for a goof.  You do that.  Sure.  For fun.  For fun.  Why not?  You don't maybe, I don't know, pop in a PlayStation game up.  Or bang a broad.  Or bang a broad.  You know, some fun.  Maybe go out for a few drinks.  When I'm thinking fun, I'm thinking banging broad.  Sure.  Not dyeing my hair blonde.  Not going to the salon or the little hair care place and having somebody bleach your hair. 
[00:44:30]  Right.  Blonde.  For fun.  For fun.  In Miami Beach.  All right.  Let's see.  He'd been on a two-week trip with two friends to India.  All right.  Well, we don't know who these two friends are.  Oh, they went to India?  That's what it said.  That's a surprise because they don't eat meat in India.  All those things.  Oh.  So that's three red flags?  Three.  Yeah.  Okay.  Return to the United States.  Yeah.  It's been easy to Miami.  And I think the jet ski was a Christmas present from someone. 
[00:45:00]  So they'd been jet skiing.  They.  All right.  This is...  A buddy.  Let's see.  Ricky Martin, accompanied by a buddy and his pet Labrador, sunned themselves.  Hey, wait, wait.  I've got to stop you.  How long have I known you?  Oh, my God.  Years now.  How many times have we gone sunning together?  Geez, can I have a moment to count the amount of times we've spent sunning? 
[00:45:30]  Sunning.  Do you call up your buddy and say, hey, Joe, you want to go sunning?  Want to do some sunning?  Sunning.  No.  No.  No, we have never sunned.  All right.  That's four red flags.  Sunning themselves before, and listen closely to the way this is phrased, before jumping on  a jet ski to tool around the bay.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Okay, listen.  That's five red flags.  Now, Ant?  Yes. 
[00:46:00]  Once again, I have to ask you.  We've known each other a long time.  Uh-huh.  You love jet skiing.  Opie, I own my own Sea-Doo watercraft, personal watercraft, the two-seat version, you know?  Sure.  The one with the big seat where somebody can sit on the back.  Right.  If they damn well please.  Correct.  Yeah.  How many times have we gone jet skiing on the same jet ski together?  Never, ever, ever, never, ever, never.  Never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, never, ever, ever, never.  First of all, what are you going to hold on to? 
[00:46:30]  Right.  Like the whole gag when you get a girl on the back is there's a handle up front.  Right.  You know?  Hold on tight.  I'm going to jump some waves over here.  You better hold on.  Sure.  I'm going to try to blow your bikini top off when I go through this boat wake.  You know?  Little tricks I just couldn't imagine playing on the opster hanging on the back of the jet  ski.  You know what I mean?  It just wasn't going to happen. 
[00:47:00]  Sharing a jet ski.  A jet ski with his buddy.  And from the looks of it, I don't know.  They could not have found a more gay picture of this man to put in the daily news.  You know what's funny about that whole picture too?  Let me take a look.  They're having like some kind of little fight too.  It's like a little moment or something because he seems a little miffed.  Yeah, like Ricky with his cute little blonde hair.  I want to ride the jet ski next.  And you sit in the back.  He's pouting.  And his friend is kind of like behind him, kind of like talking to him. 
[00:47:30]  Trying to smooth things over.  And when I'm bummed about the radio show, will we ever find a picture of us like that  in the paper?  I don't think that you could ever find a moment like that with us.  Never.  You're bummed about the show?  I'm like, well, I'll go down and get some beer.  Problem solved.  We feel much better about things.  Sure.  No.  Let's get Ricky's all pouty.  I want to drive.  You're always driving.  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo! 
[00:48:30]  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Oh, my God. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  Now the abuse is coming.  Scott, what's going on?  I'm thinking Sandy's loving you now because you must look exactly like Ricky Martin now.  Well, if you remember the time Jon Stewart came in, there was a whole controversy how Sandy wanted you to get a Ricky Martin hairdo. 
[00:49:30]  Right.  I guess he heard it.  Well, you can't tell what his hairstyle is like in this because it's been puffed back from the jet ski.  From the jizz.  So, actually, what are we saying about Opie now if he has that bleach blonde hair?  He doesn't have bleach blonde hair.  Just say it.  Opie doesn't have bleach blonde hair.  And I didn't have a choice.  This is what I was born with.  You know, when you start dyeing your hair, you know, bleach blonde. 
[00:50:00]  It's for fun.  Well, you know, I saw you in the Raw magazine.  I figured with a little bleach, you know, you could be a baloney smuggler like Ricky.  Oh, give me a break.  I'm just busting you.  All right, Scott.  Hey, Don, you're a gay guy?  Yeah.  All right, what's the problem?  I'm wondering why you guys are so homophobic.  What does it matter, Ricky Martin's gay?  I'll tell you why it matters.  Why isn't he singing songs about guys?  Yeah.  Because then his career would be over.  Well, we can't talk about it, but him being silent is fine. 
[00:50:30]  He's goofing.  I'm offended he's singing about banging chicks.  Well, it's because he has to.  No, I don't care that he's gay, but what I care about.  You're not ranking on him because he's gay if you think he's gay.  I'm more ranking on him that he's, you know, and we don't know for sure,  but I'm ranking on the fact that he's singing about girls,  and it seems like he doesn't really know much about women.  Yeah.  Okay, I have a problem with that.  Yes.  Who's going to buy his records if they know he's singing to guys?  Oh, all you gay guys. 
[00:51:00]  All you gay guys who will be so happy that he came out of the closet if he is gay.  And I haven't even bought his record.  I don't like his music.  He's a nice-looking guy.  You have to at least...  Don, honestly, if he is gay, I feel sorry for him, you know?  I mean, could you see it?  And I, you know, we want to make it so bad that we're going to sing, you know,  if it was popular to sing about guys, all of a sudden we'd put a record out singing about guys because...  Right.  Because that's the only way we can, you know, make it. 
[00:51:30]  But screw that.  Well, I understand, but it just seems like you're ranking on the poor guy.  He's in a tough situation.  He's probably got managers and PR people telling him...  I'm laughing.  I'm laughing.  I'm laughing.  He's got the worst of both worlds is what he's got.  He's probably so happy.  You put the camera in front of this guy's face.  He flashes that big smile.  He's talking about how great everything is, how wonderful.  And you know he's probably miserable.  He probably is.  He can't get the hot beef injection in public because he's got to make it like he likes chicks. 
[00:52:00]  And all those crazy Puerto Rican girls jumping around, loving him.  Ricky, Ricky, come to me.  Ricky.  They all interview him.  When it comes to the garden and stuff, they get the cameras down there by the police lines.  Ricky, I just want to say I love you.  And please, if you would just come to me, I'd be the best if you ever had.  Ricky, please come to me.  Ricky, I love you.  I love you.  I would love you.  I would give you love like you've never had.  Yeah, you would.  You don't have a penis.  Ricky, you're nothing like you've never had.  But people like you make it hard. 
[00:52:30]  You foster the hatred of them.  No, people like us don't make it hard.  But this guy in the picture looks like you might have.  All right, come on.  All right, enough.  Do you guys have any gay friends?  Honestly, let me think about that.  Gay friends?  I don't think so.  I had a homo friend.  We talked about that.  I wouldn't have a problem having a gay friend.  I have a problem with people being fake.  It's not being fake.  Yeah, it is.  It's having a hide.  You know, it's like in Nazi Germany, you had a hide, you were a Jew.  Well, it's not worth it. 
[00:53:00]  He wants to be that famous that he's going to hide and sing about women.  If you were gay, or one of you were gay, would you be out on the radio and be Gay Anthony and Great Opie?  Yes.  Hi, it's the Gay Anthony show with Opie.  You honestly believe we're out.  Opie and Gay Anthony.  Well, you're on to us.  That's why we take so much time off.  We're too busy.  We can't get out of the bedroom.  No, I'm not saying that.  Yeah, I'd be out because I'd be banging the guys all night.  You're talking about it. 
[00:53:30]  You know you'd be biting a pillow.  I'd be pulling your hair, Don.  I don't think so.  You have my type.  You're a type.  What's your type?  Anything with a schween.  See, you guys are crazy.  Oh, come on.  Oh, we talk about stereotypes and everything else, and then we get this stereotype that  gay guys will screw anything, and you go crazy.  Well, straight guys will screw anything, too.  Hallelujah.  But a straight guy has to find a girl.  There's the trick.  There's the trick, Don. 
[00:54:00]  A straight guy has to find a girl.  You gay guys, you bump into each other.  It's like, hey, you want to screw?  Okay.  Why not?  Whether he's gay or straight, he has, you know, he's horny.  Yeah, but then you're bumping into another guy who's horny.  That's why I'm saying gay guys probably have more sex than straight guys.  And, Don, when was the last time you got a piece?  I have a steady relationship for eight and a half years.  Well, congratulations.  And when was the last time you boned?  Saturday.  Pitcher?  Catcher?  Yeah, what do you do?  Both?  A little of both.  A little of both, huh?  It's the best of both worlds. 
[00:54:30]  You can limit yourself to one or the other.  Best of both worlds.  Uranus and Uranus.  It's the only worlds involved there.  Come on, guys.  Why?  You don't think it's funny to straight.  You know something?  You gay guys got to figure this out.  Figure what out?  Just because we think it's funny and stuff doesn't mean we hate you and we're on the road to bashing and stuff like that.  But you've got to admit, to a straight guy, gay sex is the funniest damn thing ever.  Just like man-ass. 
[00:55:00]  How do you look at man-ass and go, wow, I want a piece of that.  I need some of that.  That's like putting pie.  And want to go down on that.  Well, that's cash.  And Don, trust me, there are some women.  Yeah, you're right.  I'll agree with you.  But I mean...  But you're like rolling a guy over and looking at that big hairy thing is better than a woman's snatch?  It's what you are.  I mean, I didn't ask to be this way.  It's just that I am. 
[00:55:30]  You didn't ask what?  I didn't ask to be this way.  It's what I was.  When did you know, Don?  When I was 18.  Yeah?  18.  That's when I finally admitted it.  But I mean, you could look at it like...  I really need to understand this, okay?  You're at the gym, let's say.  You're in the shower and there's a guy next to you with the hairiest of asses.  You honestly get turned on by that?  I don't like Wolfman-like guys.  There's all different kinds of guys. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, he likes the hairless.  He likes the girls, not hairless.  I think most guys have a hairy ass, though, right?  Let me check.  Not that I do.  Jesus Christ.  Get out of here.  Plus, I've been with the same person for eight and a half years, so I haven't seen one really.  Eight and a half years, huh?  Yeah.  How long have you been together with your partner?  Oh, too long.  Wow, that's pretty good.  You goof on everybody, but it just seems like...  Well, then you get these calls from these idiots that listen to you, some of them that are idiots, 
[00:56:30]  and they just want to take what you say and then use that as an excuse to hate gay people and bash them.  Oh, hate.  See, it's not hate.  You're mistaking humor and fun for hatred.  Yeah, Don, I mean, if you're a faithful listener to the show, you don't hear the hate in our voices.  Don't hate gay people.  Think it's some funny-ass crap, though.  Think it's some funny stuff, though.  And it's real.  We're very real on this radio show.  We're not going to fake it.  I know you're real.  All right?  I'm saying some of your listeners interpret what you're saying and use that as an excuse to hate.

Tommy from Staten Island says,  Gay guys don't have hairy asses because the friction of the other fag's stomach rubbing on it makes it disappear.

[01:14:00]  And then laugh  And then laugh  At how outrageous  It is  Why is  That's different  Than inviting a person  Of that ethnic background  In the studio  And then saying it  Alright  See that's the same thing  As you at your phone call  Look at the Reverend  Now sticking his head  In the door  We weren't talking  About your people  Oh no  We weren't talking  About your people  It was someone else  What remark was made  I demand an investigation  I demand  An inquiry  Into what goes on  Behind the scenes

[01:31:30]  Yes I did  Did you have fun with Opie pulling the wagon  Yes  We had a wonderful time  Did he pull the wagon  Yes we both pulled the wagon  You both  He failed to mention the fact  That there's pictures of me  Of him pulling the wagon  With pumpkins in it  There's also a picture of him  They had this huge pumpkin  Cut out  That you stand behind it  And put your face through  I guess you forgot to mention  That there's a picture  Of him doing that too  Wait a minute  Yes  He's sticking his hair 
[01:32:00]  To a big pumpkin cut out  Wasn't my idea  That was too  Oh Steve's got to get  The website back on  We've got to get those pictures on  What else  What about when you were like  Knee deep in the pumpkin vines  Trying to find some gourds  Gourds  All those little gourds  Like the yellow and orange  Little  To do what  She wants to put him  In a basket  I'm putting him in a basket  He didn't mention that  And he was the one  Wait no no no  He was the one

[01:34:00]  So you wait online  For that  At that point  I was ready  Just say forget it  We'll just walk  Through the fields  And get the pumpkins  But he insisted  On the wagon  Opie insisted  On waiting for the wagon  You're not going  To make me look mad  All right thanks Sam  What skirt was Opie wearing  Shut up  I'll talk to you later  Okay bye  Bye  I wonder if he got a ride  In the wagon  Did she pull him along  Can we finish this segment

[01:41:00]  Doesn't get oral favors  From a page  Yeah, huh?  Wow  So, yeah, Adam was supposed to do Letterman  Last time he was on the show  What, last week?  You know what I like?  Every time I come in here  It's  Hi, we're going to break your balls  For a little bit  First, it's you dated my sister  Then it's the Olive Garden commercial  Then I think you nailed me on the Love Boat episode I did  I missed that damn thing  You better have a tape of that  I want to buy all the tapes of that  What, are you kidding me?  Because I got to see that  You were on the  Adam was on an episode of the new Love Boat 
[01:41:30]  The new Love Boat  Oh, don't start  You want me to sing some of the early songs you wrote?  Thank you, no  Okay  Well, we got a lot of crabs on you  Oh, Dara  I didn't write that  That was Joe Buck's song  Oh, Joe Buck wrote that?  Yeah, my brother wrote that one  That one sucked  Wait, wait, wait, wait  There's too much going on here  What?  What was the song?  For two people  Me and Anthony  Yeah, right?  Not really  He sung a song called Dara  But Joe wrote it  Now, there's a lot  The early collections of As Is  Spelled A-Z-I-Z 
[01:42:00]  Which is the name of like 90% of the cab drivers  All right  Yeah  That was the name of one of your band there?  As Is  Do you think I named it?  Okay  Look, I showed up drunk to sing  That was the extent of it  Oh, now you're Jim Morrison  I didn't move equipment  Yeah, I'm true  I didn't write the song  Now you're Jim Morrison  Before when you were going  My voice  He's walking around with an ascot and an atom  Oh, yeah, right  Don't come back  I must keep everybody away  Why?  Because we're doing  What was that song you used to do  The bus cast? 
[01:42:30]  Lido  And I can't hit the Lido  That's it  The Lido Shuffle  The Lido Shuffle  Get out of here  You're going to miss the boat  It's breaking up  I need more mist in my throat  Can we transpose this to my key?  I've seen it work it, man  After a gig  It's hilarious  Jesus  The rest of his band is like  Shuffling equipment back to the van  And there's Ann drinking his Budweiser  At the bar going  Hey, man  Tell me more about my eyes  Come on  What do you expect?  That was a while ago 
[01:43:00]  That was fun, though  I like them  Because I used to run the lights  And Anthony would build  He's a mad scientist  For God's sake  You know, you leave something in his house  He MacGyvers it into a helicopter  It was toothpicks and a rubber band  Not anymore  It's a spruce goose, too  So he used to hook up the light board  With these big rubber Luco gloves  The 220 off the pole  You had to actually open up  The circuit breaker box  In the club  And clamp on these big  Looked like jumper cables 
[01:43:30]  They were jumper cables  On to the 220 bolts  On to the 2110 legs  Coming out of the box  And they're live  You can't shut it off  Because the club is running  So you'd have to sit there  With big rubber gloves on  And it was like  Ghostbusters  Don't cross the streams  Because if those things touched  He could electrocute himself  So he would take the 220 lines  And he would channel it  Through all this stuff  Into an old Atari board  Remember Atari board  With the four switches  And that's what  We had four channels of lights 
[01:44:00]  And that was  That was when the  Original light board  Broke, my friend  And I had to rig it  Oh, the one you built  That shop driver  Oh, the one you stole  Yeah  Some stupid lighting company  In Jersey rented us lights  We never brought them back  You know what I like  Terrorists try to  Get the deposit back  On the van  He doesn't bring back  A light thing  Wow, too funny  Well, that was  That was many, many years ago  Many, many years ago  And of course  We do dredge up these things  And things that you did  In the past  Because I don't know why 
[01:44:30]  It's not interesting at all  It's not  It's amusing to us  But we were saying  You got bumped from Letterman  That's where it started  And it was  Last week  And there's a lot of people  On the phone  That feel bad for you  Thank you  Kathleen  Yeah, I want to say  How many times  Have you been bumped from Letterman  What's the process like  And does it really piss you off  This is my first time  Being bumped  It hurts  And I'm getting over the pain  Thank you, Kevin  Adam walked through  Our studio door today  I said, hey  If you were on Letterman last week  I don't think we would have  Saw your face for a while  Yeah, I know

[01:45:30]  They're sitting right there  Up front  To see their son  On national TV  David Letterman  Pop took a nap  In the afternoon  So he'd be alright  So he could stay away  Sure  And what happens  He gets bonked  And you know  Your parents had to  Get up and leave  Without seeing you  Hit the big stage  No my father's like  Hey it happens  That's life  You want Chinese  That was it  That was it  That was it  You got some steamed dumplings  And you move on  You think  Yeah tonight  You think Dave's gonna have  You know  45 minutes  Of crap 
[01:46:00]  Stupid bits  Where he takes a camera  To the film store  Next door from the studio  While Hillary waits  In the green room  Wondering if she's gonna be on  I don't think so  And who's more entertaining  Hillary or Adam Ferrara  Adam Ferrara  Adam Ferrara  Absolutely  Never saw Hillary say  Hospitaliano  Oh  There it is  There it is  There it is  There it is  There had to be a  By the way  In this somewhere Alice  Alright  What's by the way  Aha  Adam I remember a time

[02:08:00]  Knocked on the door  And asked him where the carousel was  Oh god  You're going  What was I  I was like 14 years old  Yeah  You knocked on Billy Joel's house  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  I was lost  Yeah  And I knew who lived there  Yeah  I knew he lived there  What was that  Lloyd Neck  That was the one I bought  That one of the house  In Lloyd Neck  Yeah  Yeah  Ozzy was with me  Yeah  And he goes  Where the hell are we  Oh I know  Who lives here  Pull over  I know who lives here  I saw it  He didn't know you 
[02:08:30]  What were you doing in that area  There's nothing there  I think we were  We were in the fencing truck  We were working  Yeah  Of course  You only go during the day  When you're working  We were working during the day  And we finished the job early  I'm like  I don't want to go back  I'm going to finish shop now  Fiddle put me on a forklift  That's right  I went out  So Ozzy goes  Where are we going to go  How are we going to get out  He says  Pull over here  I know the guy that lives there  I know the guy  Well he goes  Who lives there  I go  You don't know him  So I got out  I knocked on the door  And he came out  Billy Joel  And I asked him  Did he know  Yeah he knew  Like he 
[02:09:00]  He wasn't always Billy Joel  He had a day job  Yeah  You like any of this crap  It's the worst of opening  Anthony  1027 WNW  1027 WNW  It's the OB and Anthony show  Hey  Got a bunch of contestants on the line  Anthony  Want to play black or white?  See if there's any truth to this  Stereotypical black voice  Or stereotypical white voice  Yeah a lot of people  You know get upset 
[02:09:30]  When you say  You sound black  On the phone  Right  Like well what does that mean  Is there a stereotypical  Sounding black voice  And I think we  Say yes  Yeah  No one would  No one would mistake me  For sounding black  Would they?  No  No  But our own black Earl  Sounds really white  Still I could tell  That he's black?  Yeah  You could tell  When he starts getting angry  Alright  Well yeah  Alright so how are we going to play this game? 
[02:10:00]  We got some prizes to give away  To anyone that beats us  Alright we plunk a phone line down  And then  We ask them a couple of questions  Yeah the deal is  Ant and I both get two questions  And then we'll guess  If you're black or white  Okay?  Okay  We could ask any questions  So that could help as well  Yeah  Alright let's go to line one  No just based on speech  You can't ask questions  About anything else  This is just based on speech  Alright hold on  Hold on  Well then we  I want to ask questions  Give it then 
[02:10:30]  It blows the whole thing  The whole thing is just  Based on speech  Whoa whoa whoa  Now I'm going to bury you  Why would that blow it?  If I ask this guy  This guy his name  Why would that blow it?  Because it might be  A black name?  Shamil or something  Why is Shamil a black name Anthony?  It's not  It's a Jewish name  So I think  If we're going to be fair here  We can just ask him questions  It doesn't matter  Alright  You're doing the exact same  I think it takes away from the validity  Of the attest  Why?  You're doing the exact same thing  I did a little while ago  Saying that I can hear  When someone is  You know  Black or white 
[02:11:00]  Yeah so  What if I asked this guy's name  And he said  You know  Shamil  Yeah  Shamil  Shamil  Whatever  Alright  Then you would  You would think  That it's  He would probably be black  Why?  Because that's a black person's name  There's white people  Named Shamil somewhere  Not many  I'm sure  Not many  It would increase the odds  That he would be black  So are we allowed to ask any questions or not?  No  You could just have them state things  I wouldn't ask questions  This is supposed to be  Just based on 
[02:11:30]  The sound of a voice  Nothing else  What the voice is saying  Doesn't matter  Alright let's start  Hi who's this?  Sam  Alright  Alright Sam  Sam tell us a little bit about yourself  I work in Deer Park  I got a joke for you  If you want to hear that  Okay  Okay  What is Brooklyn?

All righty, and moron number three is sitting in for the guys that are on vacation this week.  It's the worst of O.P. Anthony all week.  Tomorrow and Friday as well, so if you've got any suggestions, feel free to call them in at 212-757-1027. 
[02:29:30]  Or you can fax them in at 212-957-WNEW.  Or use the instant feedback, which is up and working.  Getting a lot of good requests from that.  A lot of requests that I've been getting over the past couple of days is something we've never replayed.  Once it was played once, we kind of forgot about it and never did anything about it.  And it's called the Star Wars Scam.  I don't know if you guys were listening around that time.  If you didn't hear when this happened. 
[02:30:00]  It happened about a year ago.  Let's see, myself, Ben, and Black Earl took the van out.  We went down the street a couple blocks over to one of the theaters that was, I guess,  going to be the first theater in town to show the new Star Wars Phantom Menace.  And so, you know, we're in there.  We're figuring we're going to...  What we were going to do was basically, because we knew, you know, a lot of the plot lines  and we were going to give away basically most of the movie to the people who were online, all the freaks.  Ben and I were going to, you know, I was going to stick my head out. 
[02:30:30]  I had the bullhorn.  I was going to yell the plot lines out.  And Ben was going to hand out prizes to suck on these people in.  Right, Ben?  That's right.  And Ben, what did you go and do before we even started the bit?  I thought it already started, so I gave out keychains, which turned out to be the world's worst thing to give away.  Keychains and pens.  This was a Ziegfeld there.  It was like the world premiere.  Right.  Of the movie.  And we've gotten a lot of requests to replay this bit.  And it needs a setup only because if you didn't hear it, it's just classic how Ben, not knowing we weren't starting yet, 
[02:31:00]  and I thought he knew that we weren't starting yet, but he ran off to the crowd anyway and started handing things out.  So this is the part that people really dug was when I wigged out on Ben before the bit even started was when I wigged out on Ben.  And those bastards decided to tape it because they thought it would be funny.  So here, check this out.  Get his ass over here. 
[02:31:30]  Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ.  Whoa, now we're not going to have anything to give people.  What the f***?  Now we've got to move on.  Oh, this whole f***ing bit is trash.  Hold on.  Jesus Christ.  Where the hell is Ben?  Is he out there still out, idiot?  What are you doing giving away stuff yet?  I haven't started.  Oh, I thought you were trying to...  Oh, Jesus.  What the f*** were you doing?  Are you still telling me to go out?  No, I didn't say go out.  I said get ready.  We're going to do this now.  Now we've got no CDs. 
[02:32:00]  How are we going to start?  We have more stuff.  We have more stuff.  Oh.  Well, why don't you start for it?  It ruins the bit.  I didn't.  No, you didn't.  Why did you say start?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I never said start.  I never said start.  Why did you start giving out stuff?  I thought you were f***ing on the phone.  I am on the phone.  They got me on hold.  I didn't know that.  Well, sit in here.  We're going to get a f***ing...  Soon.  All right.  Let's try this again, okay? 
[02:32:30]  Jesus Christ.  That's good, man.  As you can hear, those two idiots were taping it the entire time.  As I wigged out on Ben, unfortunately.  They caught it all on tape.  And the funniest thing that was, that day, we let Earl drive, which was another major mistake.  Yeah, which is something that you'll be able to hear once we actually do the bit.  Um, you'll hear things happening.  And, uh, turns out, Earl's not the most aggressive driver in the world, especially in the midst of Manhattan at about five o'clock in the afternoon. 
[02:33:00]  So, uh, here's part two of the, uh, Star Wars, uh, bit.  All right?  It's the worst of Obie and Anthony.  So pay attention, answer.  1027 WNEW.  Rick!  Guys!  What's up, buddy?  What's the crowd like?  Uh, well, we're in front of the Sigfeld Theater.  Uh, everybody's buying their tickets for Star Wars, which is opening next week.

And we're going to give away some, uh, free CDs and stuff.  Codicy of, of course, Obie and Anthony and N.E.W.  And, uh, a few other surprises for Star Wars fans.  Oh, that should be nice.  Let's hear some of this.  This is a cute radio.  Hold on.  Here we go.  All right.  Hey, Star Wars fans.  What?  Obie and Anthony from W.N.E.W.

[02:41:30]  The  The common  Thought behind rape  Is that it's not a crime  Of passion  Or sex  It's just a violent act  And people said  That the rapist  It has nothing to do  With sex  It's all about power  And violence  But this guy is saying  That it is just a sexual thing  And it goes back to like  Caveman time  Caveman days  Where we just forced ourselves  Upon the  The cave woman  You ever see that  Clan of the cave bear?

Shrink talk  Okay  I mean it's boring  But it's absolutely true

Shut up!  Goddamn bitches. 
[02:49:00]  There she's screaming like she doesn't like me sticking my fist in there.  I'm going to hogtie you, you bitch.  Yeah, can I do a little more foreplay?  I'm going to punch you in your uterus.  There we go.  There we go.  Oh, let me just grab a handful of ovaries.  That's good.  I should. 
[02:49:30]  See, now I'm no old CBS airfare.  It's I and Mike with you.  What the hell is this?  I crawled inside my uterus.  A couple of blows to the vulva.  I drive a vulva.  Mike, give me more, Mike.  Give me more.  You want more?  Here you go, man.  Yeah, you keep screaming.  There you go. 
[02:50:00]  Right in the bung.  I went to prison for nothing.  Courtney, what's going on?  Yeah, hi.  I'm a psychologist also.  And I wanted to know that if they were saying from the evolutionary standpoint,  that, what, that they like to rape?  I don't know nothing about evolution.  I haven't reached that yet.  That's like puberty for me.  I ain't gone through it.  What else also?  Didn't the cavemen also kill each other to eat food? 
[02:50:30]  I mean, come on.  I still do.  You saw that fight where I bite the ear off.  I'm still doing that.  You need to tell that guy to put himself into a jail and have him be raped.  Yeah, by me, Mike Tyson.  Exactly.  I heard Mike loves it.  I heard Mike would give him a good one, too.  I heard a couple of boys.  I were in prison.  I would call queens of the weight room prom.  It was great.  I'd dress them all up.  They would toss my salad. 
[02:51:00]  A lot of controversy on the show today.  Trish is saying that a lot of girls want to be raped today.  I'm not talking stuff.  I agree wholeheartedly.  And it's easier to rape them after you do this.  You want to tie my hair?  Shut up.  You came to my hotel when you wanted it.  You looked at me.  You wanted it.  You were running down the street screaming.  You wanted it.  Marcy, what's going on? 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, I just want to know how old Trisha is.  28.  And what's your education, dear?  What's my education?  Yeah, do you have an education?  Yeah, I went to college for two years.  Really?  Well, spontaneity is not a word.  Yes, it is.  No, it's not, Mike.  I'm not.  Trisha, if you know anybody that has been raped in the past, it was not a real pleasant experience.  It certainly does not turn people on.  And I really think you're a big bimbo. 
[02:52:00]  You ain't going to be fine.  Shut up, you whore.  Wait a minute.  Can I tell you something?  I'm not talking technically as far as, like, getting attacked and raped and beaten up.  I'm talking about...  I just think you ought to rethink it.  I'm talking...  All right, let me restate it.  I'm talking about a little bit of foreplay where your hair gets pulled, you get spanked around.  It's not anything that's going to physically hurt the woman, per se.  Okay, I apologize.  For us women that listen to O&A, and, you know, I personally enjoy you guys, get out of hand. 
[02:52:30]  I mean, this sends out a bad message.  I agree with our little hair pulling, maybe a little name calling, some gentle biting, and a spade shovel over the head.  That's a night out with Iron Mike.  Oh, look, the whore hung up.  Marcy hung up.  Well, it's a sixth statement by this biologist.  Let's play that again.  Yes, indeed.  Rape is natural, biological, and evolved.  That is, there's no question but that rape is biological.  All right, I'm going out tonight. 
[02:53:00]  Look, look at that.  I'm working out on the heavy bag.  Only it's your prostate.  Patty, what's going on?  I just wanted to say that as far as, like, women, you know, fantasizing about being raped and everything.  Yes.  As far as myself, you know, if I'm with somebody I trust, it's one thing, but I don't know about women fantasizing about getting raped, you know.  But what about if you're with a big boxer ex-convict?  How would you feel then? 
[02:53:30]  Huh?  In such a box, how do you feel, you bitch?  Bridget.  Yes.  What's up?  What can you add to this?  I was supposed to say that there's a big difference between rape and fantasizing about rough sex.  Not with me.  But the whole true definition of rape is when it's sex against your will.  So if you're fantasizing about something.  I don't care what that name is, Will, Bob, Pete.  I don't care.  I'm doing more.  Well, I know you don't care about it, Mike. 
[02:54:00]  But the point is, I think we need to worry about the line that we're crossing between rape and fantasizing with rough sex.  I mean, it's just.  That's a big difference, obviously.  You know, and I think, you know, I love this show, and I listen to it every day on my drive home.  It makes an hour go by fast.  But we need to, you know, just be careful about the line that we're crossing.  That's all.  Thank you, Bridget.  You know how you stop that?  All the screaming?  Yeah.  Disable the jaw.  Most bitches I punched, I noticed they got a glass jaw. 
[02:54:30]  They can't even take a punch.  It's like it doesn't even have to be a full right hand.  It can just be like a short arm left or something, and they go right down.  Look, Mike, watch this one.  Look, get back here.  Look, watch.  Down.  It didn't take nothing.  You made a sore tire, you will.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Today, we're stuck with the worst of O.B.N.  1-0-2-7 WNEW. 
[02:55:00]  Today I'd like to talk to you on a very serious note  Because this is the story of a man overcoming monumental physical pain and suffering  I went to the DMV today and it was really, really ugly  There's nothing funny about what you're about to hear  Everything was organized, I went in there  That's such a part of just being like a man  Just going to motor vehicle and registering  Well, Anthony, I'm not a man  Work with me, son  So I get to the lady, and I must say, the nicest DMV lady ever, ever 
[02:55:30]  She wasn't the problem this time  The last three times, they were the problem  All right, so she's going through all the forms like  Okay, we'll get you out of here in a jiffy  Right  And she's going through all the stuff  And I'm like, all right, finally  Fourth time going to DMV to get my vehicle registered  This is it, I'm finally going to have New York plates  Let's be told, today's world can be Nandy Panic  All of a sudden she says, okay, I just need a copy of the title  Is this the title?  I started panicking 
[02:56:00]  What to do?  What to do?  So I had to get the leasing company on the line  This was the last time I went  To send me the power of attorney  Basically saying it's okay to register the car in New York State  All right?  Uh-huh  You would think the people, when they're sending that  Would send a copy of the title  Knowing I'm going to need that as well, Anthony  No, you can't expect them to do that  So I don't have the title  So now I can't do it  So now I'm ready to go home  Which means I'd have to go back to the DMV for the fifth time  No, no, no! 
[02:56:30]  So then the lady sees the panic on my face  She goes, look, can you get the leasing company to fax it over?  The title  If I get a fax of it, boom, you're out of here in two minutes  I'm like, no problem  He realizes he's got to get it  So I go out in the hall  It's key to the story that you know I only had 70 cents in my pocket  I call the leasing company and I explain my situation  I need my, you know, the title faxed over to the DMV  The lady says, I can't do that for you  You have to talk to Judy  Judy is busy with another customer 
[02:57:00]  You'll have to call her back  Click, hangs up on me  No, no, no!  I don't have enough money to call damn Judy  So what do I do?  I drive all the way home  He figures, what the heck?  And I call Judy and I give her a piece of my mind  I say, Judy, listen  You have to fax a copy of the title to DMV right now  Will there be a problem?  She says, oh, no problem at all  Will you do it now?  She goes, yes  I go, okay  I am going to leave my house for the DMV  I expect that title to be faxed when I get there 
[02:57:30]  That is beautiful  Alright, it gets better  So I go back to the DMV  Everyone knows now because I was there an hour before or whatever, okay?  I spend 20 minutes staring at the fax machine  Waiting for a copy of the title to come through  What to do?  What to do?  20 minutes later, it's not coming through the fax machine, okay?  He said it would not work  After 20 minutes away in the DMV, I'm like, okay, there's a problem  Now I have to make another call  I don't have any change  No, no, no!  So I'm at the customer service 
[02:58:00]  I explain, look, the lady was supposed to fax it 20 minutes ago  I've been staring at the fax machine  There's a problem, I need to use your phone  She goes, there's a phone in the lobby there, whatever, right?  I said, no, I have one nickel  I can't make a call  The lady, supposedly part of customer service, goes  You'll have to talk to a supervisor  His arm arose  I go, it's a goddamn phone call!  Give me your phone!  Sir, you're building bridges  You're making friends  Now the real friendly teller  Heard me screaming at the lady  And she goes  And she goes, here 
[02:58:30]  And she hands me a cordless phone  I go, thank you  And then I turn to the customer service lady  And I go, was that hard to do?  He got up and got one!  So I call the leasing company again  And I go, hi  Remember you said you would fax it in 20 minutes?  I've been staring at the fax machine  Guess what?  Nothing is popping out  What's the problem?  Oh, I'll fax it right over  I made a copy of it  It was too light, blah, blah, blah  I'm like, will you fax it right now  Before I come back in here with an automatic weapon 
[02:59:00]  And shoot everybody?  And did she?  She did!  She did!  15 minutes later, she sends it over  You've got moxie  And don't let anyone ever take that away from you  And then, uh, I paid my $72.50  So I wrote the check and I got out of there  Young man, do you ever look back and wonder what would have happened if you'd just given up?  If you hadn't followed your dreams?  I took five trips to DMV to get my license and my registration  And I think we've all learned a lesson from this  You've showed us that while no man is an island, one man can make a difference 
[02:59:30]  And now I'm registered in New York  Pretty cool  I'd say you are very cool  A very cool cat indeed  And now  The worst of Opie and Anthony  107 WNEW  Now we've got to talk to Rick really fast here  On the instant feedback, Randy from Tarrytown, New York  He writes, I just saw that punishment video with Ricky  Holy jeez, what a chokehold he had on that fruit 
[03:00:00]  Oh yeah, I saw the clip, Rick  I haven't even seen it  Alright, go over there and check it out on Anthony's computer  The clip up on the, uh  I'll explain it while Hank gets the clip  We don't even want to talk about her anymore  But we have to this one last time  Christian, the Oklahoma prude, came down  She promised that she would bring beer and get topless for us and hang out in the studio  We said, cool, we like seeing naked breasts  Come on down  She comes down and she turns out to be the biggest prude ever to appear on the Opie and Anthony show  So we come up with this punishment 
[03:00:30]  We make her see the 100 year old lady having sex  A video that Steve from the unofficial website brought in yesterday  And Rick is making her watch this video  Yeah  And, uh, he's really being forceful  Which is kind of a good thing  But Rick, look at the hold you have on her  I don't know  Look at her jaw  Set his toe  Yeah, that's it  I don't watch this, here she goes  Come on, look up 
[03:01:00]  Look, look, there you go  He's like, look up  You want to take your top off now?  You want to take your top off now?  You must have your fingerprints around her neck, Rick  What's wrong with you?  Go into the other studio and get the real audio so everyone at home can hear it  We got the audio of Rick and the prude watching the 100 year old lady having sex  And Rick is just forcing this poor girl, now I feel sorry for her  Forcing her to watch this video  I don't feel sorry for her at all, but, uh, boy, that Rick, huh?

Yeah  It's not one of the guys  I didn't have any rope to tie her down with  So I had to hold her in place  Now you're bullying around, like, prudes from Oklahoma  Rick, uh, checking in on the instant feedback  Rich, Rick beats his wife  That's all he writes  John, what's going on?

[03:32:30]  No!  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  I think, Anthony, we've gone too far today.  Why?  On the radio show.  Well, we're playing a game called Make Bridget Cry.  Yeah, Bridget had a little trouble on Hummer Tuesday last night.  It was her boyfriend's birthday.  She wanted to give him a Hummer for his birthday.  She did.  It was a beautiful scene, as she spelt it out for us. 
[03:33:00]  And when her boyfriend finished, and she accepted his finishing, he grabbed her head, pushed her away, her head hitting the floor, and said, I always knew you were a little whore.  And it was the first time she ever gave a Hummer.  Yes.  Bridget, you're still there, right?  I'm still here.  Now, remember, you said you wouldn't mind playing Make Bridget Cry, so.  You sounded like you were getting a little choked up earlier in your conversation talking about your boyfriend and how you're not going to see him again. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, it shouldn't be hard.  And you sure you want to play this?  Our listeners could be mean bastards.  That won't make me cry.  All right.  Tony!  Yeah.  You're up first.  You want to play?  Yeah, I want to play.  First of all, I know who this broad is.  Okay.  Her real name isn't Bridget.  All right.  And Tuesday night wasn't her first Hummer.  Monday night was.  She practiced on me before she was with her boyfriend.  That's why he called her a pig.  She knows it's the truth. 
[03:34:00]  And you know who this is, Bridget.  And don't pretend you don't, Bridget.  Tony, I have no idea who you are.  You don't know who this is, huh?  No.  You practiced the almond thing on me.  You wish.  Yeah.  Now, you know it's the truth.  And so does Henry, your real boyfriend.  That's why he called you a pig.  And he said you were horrible.  She knows it, One.  Thanks, guys.  She's a pig.  A stinking pig.  Oh, I don't think it's working, but that was pretty brutal.  That was brutal. 
[03:34:30]  Brett.  Yo.  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  You're on with Bridget.  Bridget.  Yeah.  What is wrong with you?  With me?  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  Why?  What do you think is going to happen when somebody sticks their penis in you?  What do you mean?  What are you going to do then?  Well, hopefully it'll end up a little better.  Huh?  Hopefully it's better.  The guy smacked you after you performed oral on him.  Yeah.  What's he going to do after he has sex with you?  Is he going to beat you around a little bit? 
[03:35:00]  I'm not going to be with him.  Huh?  Okay.  I don't think he's working.  Good try, Brett.  We're not playing the right angles.  How many seconds do we allow?  We'll just allow.  We're the sole judges.  We'll cut you off whenever we feel it's not working.  All right, EJ, you're the next contestant in Make Bridget Cry.  What's up, fellas?  What's going on?  All right, EJ.  Cool.  Hey, Bridget, I was wondering.  Yeah.  Uh, is it because, are you so upset because, was it that your mom did a better job than  your boyfriend? 
[03:35:30]  Or was it, did you have flashbacks of your father knocking you down after you did him?  Nice.  Okay, this could be wrong.  You've got to follow it up, EJ.  You ever watch a fight, and a fighter gets a good right hook in, and he wobbles the guy,  but then the fighter backs off, and you're like, pound him, pound him.  Yeah.  You know, you've got to have a follow-up to that shot.  All right, EJ.  All right, fellas.  Thank you.  Later.  All right, let's go to Pat.  Pat, you're next. 
[03:36:00]  All right, first of all, the suicide thing, a volume of two glasses of wine.  Quiet, I'm talking.  A volume of two glasses of wine in a hot shower.  That sounds like you're getting ready to go out.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, I know.  That's what I was saying.  Come on.  I mean, and this whole thing, I'll tell you, I think it happened, not in this world,  in whatever world you're in, I think this is all cooked up in your fat little head,  because I'm sure you weigh at least 300 pounds.  You're probably so ugly, no guy would let you hum. 
[03:36:30]  I mean, let's be hysterical this year.  Bridget?  Hello?  Not working.  No?  You're not as big as Monica Lewinsky?  No.  Let's go to Frankie.  Frankie!  Bridget?  Yeah?  How much you charge?  I want to know, right now.  Get on your knees and tell me what you can do.  Bridget, let me tell you something.  You know you're an expert.  You know you know what you're doing.  Tell me what it is.  What time I've got to pick you up.  Let's go out, baby.  Touch me.  You guys have sensitive listeners, huh? 
[03:37:00]  What?  You're popping volumes sitting in the shower.  Come on, honey.  I've got volumes.  Let's go.  Come on, Bridget.  I can get you.  I know I can.  You think?  I know I can.  I want it right now.  You're running out of time, Frankie.  I've got a couple of volumes.  Let's go.  All right.  That was it.  I don't think anyone's going to get you to cry, Bridget.  Uh, Dave, you're next.  Yeah, this is your daddy, Bridget.  Hi, Daddy. 
[03:37:30]  Why'd you cheat on me with that boy?  You know you're a filthy little pig.  No.  You know you're a whore.  Thanks, Dad.  I grabbed your head back because you didn't swallow at all.  That's why he smacked you.  You're only upset because he didn't tie you up and spank the hell out of you like your daddy do.  It's not called make Bridget laugh. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah, she's laughing.  I should get a prize for that, shouldn't I?  Hey, Bridget.  Yeah?  Hey, when was the, uh, when was the last time you did cry?  All night, this morning.  Really?  Yeah.  All sad about, uh, your boyfriend and how he treated you.  I loved him.  You loved him?  Just, uh, think of, think of when you first got together.  Remember that?  Everything was all nice and sweet.  Did he do nice things for you?  He was so nice. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  You went out a lot and he got you things and it was all fun.  And then last night he just pushed your head away and called you a whore.  You're never, ever going to have a good time with him ever again.  I don't want to.  That could have been the last guy that, the last decent guy you meet.  You might have to troll through scum now for years.  Oh, my God.  Having different members in your face.  No.  Week after week before you find somebody that's even half as nice as this guy treated you up until he, uh, turned on you last night. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  It's hard for a filthy whore to find a boyfriend.  You were really close.  Uh-huh.  I almost was there.  George, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  All right.  Hey, Bridget.  Yeah?  I feel really sorry for you.  You know, you spent a year with this guy.  Uh-huh.  And you guys had a lot of good times together. 
[03:39:30]  Uh-huh.  And then he turns around and it's like it didn't mean nothing to him.  All those times spent together, he just turned around and was like, you're nothing but trash.  You're nothing but dirt on my shoe.  It's even worse than he threw me.  Didn't, didn't, didn't that, that feeling just lingers with you.  It just doesn't go away, does it?  No.  Every time you just think of him, you think of all those good times, you try to please him.  For God's sake, you know?  You try to.  And you did, you didn't, I don't think you did anything wrong. 
[03:40:00]  For the love of God, I'm going to cry.  Come on.  No.  I'm sorry, Bridget, but I don't think you did anything wrong.  I think you're a pretty girl inside and you shouldn't be treated like that, you know, like trash.  He just pushed you.  It's like, you're nothing.  You're nothing to me.  You never meant nothing to me.  All right, George, thank you.  Very close.  My brother wants to play.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Hey, Darren.  Hey.  You're a cold-hearted F.  You want to play?  I am very cold. 
[03:40:30]  All right.  But I mean this with all my heart.  Bridget?  Yeah?  This is as good as it gets, babe.  What do you mean?  Does your chin, like, have calluses on it from his b**** banging you?  I mean, the whole year you're going out, that's all he's thinking.  It's like, when can I use her as a depository for my freaking st***?  Now you're going to go out.  You're going to be a slut the rest of your life.  You're never going to have a real relationship because you're going to be all freaking weepy.  You're going, ugh.  You're not going to forget this.  That taste is never going to leave your mouth and your face. 
[03:41:00]  And that's just as good as it gets.  So, you know, you're a whore.  You're a girl.  Get over it.  You know?  Thanks, Darren.  Well, life, you know, life is good for guys and bad for girls.  And that's all he wanted.  I mean, and he got it.  I applaud him.  I'm laughing.  I'm like, this is the best.  I've got to meet this guy and, you know, join the club.  That's great.  So, that's it.  Holy smoke. 
[03:41:30]  You've got more issues than Opie.  No way.  Do you know what comes out of a guy's member during the day?  And here you are, gladly accepted.  And then he throws you on the floor and that surprises you?  Oh, she hung up.  Oh, she hung up.  What the heck is going on?  I made her hang up.  My brother wins the contest.  Winner.  Yeah.  We've got to find out how many times they dumped out of my brother's speech. 
[03:42:00]  I couldn't take it anymore.  What is this?  Like, make her feel good about herself?  Forget it.  I told you, man.  He's a cold-hearted son of a man.  Man.  He's got ice flowing through his veins.  Yeah, I have Sandy over here, too.  Oh, easy.  He's going to make you cry.  All right, man.  All right, Darren.  All right.  I'll see you later.  All right, man.  I hope my brother wins. 
[03:42:30]  Wow.  That was harsh.  That was a little too real sounding coming at him.  The words of Opie and Anthony, 1027, WNEW. </pre>
