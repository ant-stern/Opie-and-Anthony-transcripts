<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, seamlessly transitioning between serious discussions and irreverent humor.  The show began with a review of the movie "50/50," focusing on its dark humor, particularly a scene involving pot brownies and chemotherapy.  Seth Rogen's performance was praised, and Bryce Dallas Howard's role was mentioned.  The hosts initially misidentified the lead actor, leading to humorous banter.  A bizarre email supposedly from Louis C.K. requesting information on vintage revolvers for writing purposes was also discussed.

The entertainment portion continued with a scathing critique of Van Halen's new song, a nearly five-minute track with a repetitive, poorly received "tattoo, tattoo" chorus.  The hosts and a caller dissected the song's lyrics (largely unintelligible), music video (featuring David Lee Roth and excessive balloons), and overall musicality.  This transitioned into a similarly harsh assessment of Jay-Z's "Glory," featuring his newborn daughter's vocals. The hosts criticized its self-importance and perceived insensitivity toward other hospital patients.  Jay-Z's personal life, past rumors of illegitimate children, and business acumen were also discussed, along with numerous tangents about other musicians like Robert Plant, Steven Tyler, and Ozzy Osbourne.  Ongoing humorous exchanges between the hosts, including discussions of Jimmy's illness and Opie's fictional clothing line, punctuated the segment.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to the controversy surrounding Navy SEAL Chris Kyle and former Governor Jesse Ventura.  The hosts discussed Kyle's claim of punching Ventura in a bar, which Ventura vehemently denied in a phone call played on air.  The discussion included speculation about motivations (book sales for Kyle, reputation for Ventura), lack of witnesses, and Alex Jones's suggestion of a scripted event involving the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sam Roberts and Jim Florentine were in studio for this segment, offering their perspectives alongside Opie and Anthony. Chris Kyle himself later called in to defend his account, leading to further debate.  This segment also briefly touched upon the Beatles' early albums and included a video of Jim Florentine smashing a television.

The Ventura/Kyle dispute continued, with Alex Jones, a guest on the show, initially siding with Ventura, believing Kyle's account to be a publicity stunt.  The hosts attempted to arrange a conversation between Ventura and Kyle.  The discussion expanded to include Jones's views on conspiracies, Ventura's political views, and Jones's website, Infowars.com.  The conversation then shifted to Jim Florentine discussing football, steroids in sports, and sharing personal anecdotes.  A lengthy, humorous discussion ensued about the merits of steroids in professional sports, veering into discussions of sex and hypothetical situations involving NFL players. This section concluded with more discussion of Van Halen, playing a video highlighting the tension between Eddie and David Lee Roth, and Florentine sharing his opinions on their new single, "Tattoo."

The show moved on to anecdotes about the Van Halen brothers and Sammy Hagar's tequila empire, along with a substantial segment featuring Jim Florentine promoting his one-man show, "I'm Your Savior." Florentine shared a harrowing story of childhood sexual abuse and its incorporation into his stand-up routine, alongside stories about past relationships and the death of his ex.  He also discussed his views on AIDS statistics and HPV vaccinations.  Vulgar anecdotes about heroin addiction based on *Intervention* were also included. Florentine promoted his podcast, "Life from the Compound," and his upcoming tour dates.

The final segment focused on the HBO documentary *Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory* about the West Memphis Three.  The hosts discussed the case and differing opinions surrounding the accused's guilt.  Technical difficulties with the studio phone system led to humorous banter with a staff member, Mars. The conversation then moved to other documentaries, Mars's musical preferences (leading to discussions of his dance moves and dance music genres), and pictures he took of Rihanna at a concert.  The segment concluded with a giveaway of a signed Jim Florentine CD/DVD and a brief mention of Skrillex.  Scheduled guests Michael Clarke Duncan and the directors of *Paradise Lost 3* were mentioned but their participation wasn't detailed.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel, XM 105, Sirius 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show with Opie. 
[00:00:30]  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony.  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  He's the dang open, Andy, don't listen to the dang open.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  Bah, bah.  Bah, phoons.  Yeah.  Bah, phoons.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bah, phoons.  Morning.  Hey, everybody.  Headphones.  There we go.  Check, check, check, check.  All good now.  You can never adjust them before the show starts.  No.  You just don't know what the volume's going to be.  Because it's all over the place.  Yeah.  Everything's all over the place.  I want to email Seth Rogen. 
[00:01:30]  Oh.  I don't have his contact info.  Oh.  And he doesn't like the Twitter.  Yeah, he's not on Twitter.  I thought he might be very rare.  No, he doesn't like social networking at all.  He's not a fan of the social networking.  So I texted Roland, yes, I'd like to see if his publicist will get me an email.  Yeah.  I haven't heard back, so.  Oh.  About his movie 50-50.  I really liked it.  I told you.  I really, really liked it.  It made me laugh out loud.  LOL.  Yeah, and I actually just said that.  I didn't laugh.  I was like, LOL.  LOL.  But I love a comedy like that.  Like, that's. 
[00:02:00]  Dark.  Yeah, it was dark.  There's some darkness there.  And Seth Rogen's a funny fuck, man.  He's a good actor, too.  Yeah, he's really funny in movies.  And a good actor.  Yeah, he's great.  I think which is different, right?  You can be funny and a bad actor.  Oh, God, yeah.  You're looking at somebody who's like that.  Ah.  Jimmy.  It's, uh.  50-50 is the cancer movie.  I liked it a lot.  I think it's going to get a lot of nominations.  Or at least a few.  I think it's going to get one for costume.  Costumes?  For costumes.  I thought you just called it the cancer movie.  It is the cancer movie. 
[00:02:30]  I mean, what are you supposed to say?  Sounds like a musical.  Guy has cancer, and guess what?  50-50.  50-50 chance of living.  He was good.  The guy that was the lead.  I forget his name.  He's from Third Rock from the Sun.  Okay.  Joseph Ford and Leavitt.  Shut up.  He's from 500 Days of Summer.  Shut up.  Inception.  Huh?  Inception.  Inception.  He's trying to help out.  Shut up.  Actually, I didn't know Inception.  Yeah.  What are you losing Inception?  Because I haven't seen Inception. 
[00:03:00]  I love it.  Yeah, people say I should see Inception.  I haven't seen Inception.  I should go and watch that, though.  I tried probably four times to watch Inception.  Yeah, a lot of people.  Fell asleep each time.  Oh, did you?  Okay.  A lot of people either really got into it or just can't get through it.  I loved Inception.  He's the dude from Third Rock from the Sun.  That you know him for.  And then he went away for a while.  And then he, I believe, he popped up in the movie 500 Days of Summer.  And now he's had kind of a second career.  Anyway, he's the lead in 50-50.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was very good.  He's Seth Rogen.  They're pals.  He's the cancer guy.  He's the cancer guy. 
[00:03:30]  Yes.  Did you see the scene when he was really high?  Yeah.  Because they were eating the pot brownies while they were doing chemo.  And then he had to walk out of the hospital after his treatment.  Yeah.  Seeing all the horrific cancer stuff around him.  And he's just hilariously laughing to himself because he's so fucked up.  Yeah.  That was funny, right?  There were some great lines.  Yeah.  I liked it a lot.  Yeah.  Good.  Bryce Howard was fucking.  She plays.  I never know it's her.  For some reason, I don't recognize her yet on face.  But she plays a great, horrible person.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's really good, man.  Which means she's probably a horrible person in real life. 
[00:04:00]  Maybe, yeah.  Nah, I don't know.  Because she seemed to get Gary Oldman all upset.  Yeah.  I know not Oldman.  Christian Bale.  She was the one in Jameson with him.  Right.  Mm.  So.  Well, she sure got that red hair.  She's so hot.  You should have watched 50-50 before the guy got here.  I was.  And now you could be praising him instead of just talking to no one about it.  I had to talk to no one.  At least I know that no one's listening.  Oh, it'll get back to you.  Well, it's the pressure, too, of seeing these projects before they come in. 
[00:04:30]  I don't mind doing it.  I just forget.  And then we got to.  Sometimes we got to make believe we didn't see the movie or didn't see the TV show  or didn't listen to their record.  I actually want to email Seth and tell him how great it was, but.  Yeah, it'll happen.  Let's hope so.  Roland just tends to love me.  Speaking of email.  I got this oddest email that was allegedly from Louis C.K., but I don't know.  He asked me for your email.  He did.  It is Louis.  That's hilarious.  He texted me and asked me for your email. 
[00:05:00]  It's the weirdest email.  I answered him, but I didn't get any response back.  You think you'd mind if I read this?  Well, it depends on what it's about.  Well, it's just about a question he wanted to ask me about the firearm.  I figured it was a gun question.  Hopefully he's looking for one that he can turn around and aim at his mouth.  No, it's the oddest gun question I've ever heard.  He just goes, it's Louis, writing to you for the first time in my life.  We've only known him for seven years. 
[00:05:30]  How are you?  How's life?  He doesn't...  No, no.  Yeah.  No, no.  He doesn't want to do that.  I would never, never, even if he did.  How's life on Long Island?  Yeah.  So I have a weird question for you, although somehow I think you probably get a lot of these questions.  Where do you buy your firearms?  Do you know a place where a fella can buy a nice kind of vintage revolver?  I'm not looking for self-protection or anything.  Oh, it's good.  You're blowing the gift he's probably going to give somebody. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  No, no.  That is a gift.  Okay.  It isn't.  He didn't say that.  He goes, I don't even want to buy ammo.  I just have a lot of cool old things that I play with while I sit at my desk and write,  and I thought fiddling with an unloaded gun would be inspiring.  Any suggestions?  Yes, load it.  Load it and juggle it.  Yeah, that's definitely Louie.  That's the nicest I've ever heard him write anybody.  That's the most.  That's amazing. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  I gave him an answer, which is he's in New York City, and there's no fucking way that  Louie can get a revolver in New York City, even if he just doesn't want to load it and  just wants to fiddle with it.  You can't even have a gun that isn't a gun but looks like a gun in New York City.  You can't have a demilled gun, which is a gun that used to be a real gun, but then they  weld up the barrel and shit, so you can't really use it.  You're not even allowed to have those.  And you can't have a replica gun in New York City.  So I gave him quite the answer of, no, there's no way in hell you can sit there and fiddle 
[00:07:00]  with a gun like some kind of film noir writer while he writes.  But that was weird.  I got that and thought, like, is this really Louie?  It's kind of a weird question.  Louie is a little weird.  Yeah.  It's him.  Yeah.  All right.  The answer is no.  The answer, nine.  That's a fairly normal Louie C.K. question. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  I could picture him sitting, like, trying to think of something and just, you know, cocking  a hammer back and, you know, going zzzz, zzzz with the cylinder.  How could you picture that?  A revolver.  Yeah, you could just care.  I know it's Louie C.K., but that's a weird visual.  Like Louie trying to write something, maybe some action thing where a gun's involved and  he would like to actually have it in his hand, you know?  Oh, okay.  Then you say something gun-ish.  Yeah, something gun-ish.  I have good gun dialogue.  Oh, do you?  I'm always like, yeah, yeah. 
[00:08:00]  You want some lead pumped into you at maximum overdrive speed, buddy?  Buddy?  That's a good one.  That's good, right?  And then I flip the gun or I hold it by the barrel and I shake it.  And I'm like, once I turn this joker around, there's no coming back.  That's good.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, boy.  It's new music day.  Jesus Christ.  I just heard.  On the O.P. and Anthony show.  I just heard. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, God.  I just heard two seconds of that and I fucking hate it.  What is it?  What do you think it is?  Dad, jump, dad, jump.  Van Halen?  Huh?  Van Halen?  We got the new Van Halen song.  Oh, yeah.  First song, what, in 24 years?  First original?  Yeah.  I guess they went back and got a lot of riffs that Eddie had had over these years. 
[00:09:00]  He's written all these riffs.  I heard they haven't put out an album since 98.  It's about right.  We're back.  I think they did some kind of greatest hits in 98, right?  Wait, 98.  98.  Studio album, I think.  Oh, 98.  Yeah.  We were still in Boston.  That was the Gary Cherone album.  Yep.  Yeah.  That's 98 already, huh?  Yes.  And they haven't had a...  Well, then...  Oh, they haven't had a new song out with David Lee Roth in 24 years.  Yeah.  Van Halen-wise.  You want to listen to this thing? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, I want to hear it.  We'll be right back. 
[00:10:00]  Elvis talks.  I got Elvis on my elbow.  I thought he said Phyllis.  I got Elvis on my elbow.  When I flex, he talks.  Oh, okay.  I thought he said Phyllis.  Something like that.  I got hooligans on the back of my leg.  Ain't she who was when I walked?  Speaking cherry red.  Screaming electric green. 
[00:10:30]  Bubble Mountain's majesty.  And they talk to me.  Talk to me.  Swap meets Sally.  Tramp step cat.  I swiped a munchhell in the time it took to get back.  We're watching the video for this at the same time.  It is exactly as Jimmy portrayed it in We're Back and Better Than Ever.  They're back to back.  They're doing the rock thing.  Kind of a laugh together.  Oh, they're laughing. 
[00:11:00]  This is so bad.  This is the worst song.  Oh, God.  That's going to be one of the worst songs I've heard in 20 years.  Oh, no.  Let's give it a chance.  Let me hear the rest of the video.  You got it over there now?  The video.  I want to see it's good now.  All right.  Hear it.  We just, okay.  Okay.  I want to see it. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, no.  He's doing a little tossing.  Let me see these true colors that follow one of your false virtues.  All right.  Knock it off, Dave.  What do you think?  Why is the crazy stuff we'd never say? 
[00:12:00]  Oh, a tree in it.  Spook in the red.  Explode, opaque.  Purple Mountain's majesty.  Show me you, I'll show you me.  Swap meets Sally.  Tramp, snap, cap.  Mouse, pop, the mom's shell.  In the time it took to get that new tattoo.  Tattoo, tattoo.  Oh.  Woo!  Tattoo, tattoo.  Sexy dragon. 
[00:12:30]  That's it.  Tattoo, tattoo.  So very odd.  Fucking Tanya.  Wow.  Tattoo, tattoo.  Tattoo, tattoo.  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  Tattoo, tattoo.  Tattoo, tattoo, tattoo.  Yeah!  See, that.  How long is this? 
[00:13:00]  It's only half over.  How long is this?  Well, the first mistake, they put out a song that's almost five minutes long.  No one wants a five-minute song these days.  There you go.  Musically, it sounds like Van Halen, but it's all over the place.  There's no hook to this song.  I actually like this, but I don't like the chorus.  Tattoo, tattoo.  I don't like that part.  Right, I know.  I don't like that part.  It's so hokey. 
[00:13:30]  I like the fucking tempo of the actual song.  Yeah.  Musically, it's all right.  I like that.  Musically, it's Van Halen.  It's Van Halen.  But I don't like the hook.  Musically, I'm cringing.  Yeah, I'm not, you know.  Tattoos aren't that important in the end.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Like, I like the way he's singing that.  I just don't like the hook, which is the big one.  Tattoo, tattoo, tattoo, tattoo, tattoo, tattoo, tattoo, tattoo, tattoo, tattoo. 
[00:14:00]  I am Mr. O'Rourke.  Tattoo, tattoo.  And Wolfgang is pretty chubby, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, wow.  I didn't realize that.  He's got his mom's ass.  Wow, way.  Needs some of that weight blotches.  Let's see if the song gets better.  Oh, yeah.  See, that shit's all right.  If you like Van Halen, that shit's all right.  Oh, yeah.  It's so heavy. 
[00:14:30]  Hey, finger tapping.  Uncle Danny  Had a gold tattoo  He fought from the union  Some of us still do  On my shoulder is the number  Of the chapter he was in  That number is forever 
[00:15:00]  Like the struddle hit away on  Everybody  Swampy Tally  Trends down tack  There's balloons on the stage  Yeah, that's  Oh, God  Checkered flag waving and confetti and balloons 
[00:15:30]  Very busy  Yeah, why are there balloons?  They just need enough shit  In front of David Lee Roth  So you don't really get a good look at them  There's so many balloons over there  It's like they're floating away  Or something  We got black and white strobe light 
[00:16:00]  Of them  So you still can't get a good look at them  It's  It's really sad  Bring it back  Do they have a whole album  Or just a couple songs they did together?  I think it's a studio album  Oh, boy  So this is the one they're putting out first  Front and center  I don't like the tattoo  It's too short a word  To make the chorus 
[00:16:30]  Yeah  It's  One word chorus shouldn't probably happen  Yeah  Tetley  Tetley  Tetley  I don't like that  I think I officially hate Van Halen  I love you  What?  I love you  Sorry  I'm funny  But I can't  I can't  No, I can't get on board that tattoo  Tattoo song  No, because the problem is  You're going to go to an arena  To see Van Halen  And they're going to have to  Shove this new shit at you  Oh, boy  And it's not good enough  No  Just play the old stuff 
[00:17:00]  Right?  Please  Is that song good?  I say  On any level?  I say  I'll get  You know  I'll be totally honest  Yeah, musically  Especially when it first kicks in  You know  Without the tattoo  Tattoo stuff  It sounds like Van Halen  Right  Eddie's lead is  You know  An Eddie lead  So you're like  It brings some nostalgia  Back, right?  Yeah, I agree with that  But other than that  It's  It's a rehash  Of everything they've already done 
[00:17:30]  There's nothing  Nothing new there  And it's only worse  Than what they've done  Did we just hear him sing  About tattoos for five minutes?  Five minutes of singing  About cliched tattoos  What's the  What are the lyrics in the chorus?  I don't know what they're saying  I don't know  That's the other problem  I have with the song  You don't understand his lyrics  You didn't even know  He said Elvis in the beginning  No, I thought he said  You weren't kidding, right?  No, girl's name  Phyllis  Phyllis?  No, he said Elvis  I believe you  I just thought he was  Mentioning girl's names  But you're right  Phyllis would have an awful one 
[00:18:00]  Yeah  Tattoo of Phyllis  Phyllis  What's that?  Jimmy  Jimmy  That's bronchitis  Will you take care of that?  I am  You are?  No, I'm going to call Dr. Steve  Oh, okay  That doesn't sound good, Jimmy  You're all phlegmy  Yeah  You're phlegmy from Motorhead  Yeah, I know  I'm phlegmy from  God, I fucked up  Oh, Chip 
[00:18:30]  I guess we should talk to the real Van Halen fans  That are really, really hardcore  All right, good idea  To see what they think  Because, um  I don't know, man  I don't like it at all  You're not feeling?  Chris on Long Island, what's up?  Good morning, ladies  Hey  Listen, I realized  I was actually 14 years old  When I heard my first Van Halen song  And probably you guys got the same age  And it just blew me away  And now you say it's 14 years  It's the last Van Halen album  And I'm sorely disappointed  Well, 14 years since, yeah 
[00:19:00]  98, when they had Gary Saron as the lead singer  Or Saron, excuse me  I think these lyrics are wrong  That Travis just gave me  Why?  I don't think he did it wrong  I think that somebody just  Oh  Because it says, uh  Sorry to interrupt you, buddy  Swap meets Sally  Tramp stamp tat  Mouse wife to bombshell  In the time it took to get that new tattoo  That sounds like it  Either it would be housewife to bombshell  Or is it mouse wife?  Tattoo  It's not like you're saying mouse wife  It did sound like mouse 
[00:19:30]  Because I didn't know  Maybe they're saying mouse wife  Like you're sheepish  And a mouse wife  Maybe  This is like a bad tattoo  You're kind of stuck with it  The rest of your life  This song now  Yeah  Maybe it's a tattoo  They shouldn't have gotten  Well  The band had a lot of pressure  It's their first song  With David Lee Roth in 24 years  So  I think  I think if I could talk  For some Van Halen fans  They might have been expecting  Something a little  A little stronger  I would have written  Like a  Tattoo of the devil  So he runs  When you run 
[00:20:00]  With him  Ah  See  Bringing in an older song  I think  The song  If you took the vocals  The way the song  Sounds pretty strong  I think  To table with age  His vocals  Sound thin  Or weak  I mean  Maybe that song  20 years ago  Might have been really hot  But  Yeah  And then  Looking at David Lee Roth's hair  Is very uncomfortable  Well his whole face  Is uncomfortable now  But it's uncomfortable  Because he's got this weird  Like balding going on  Yeah  And he's trying to go with it  God bless him 
[00:20:30]  Doesn't work  But he's  You know  He's on the stage  With Van Halen  And I don't know  I told Facebook  When you guys started playing it  And  The number of people  On Facebook  Who are talking  About how this is  The greatest thing  I've read  They're not being honest  I know they want something  But we're never going to get that again  So like you said  Put the album out  Let's forget it  Go back out on tour  Play that one song  And let me hear the rest of your head  Alright  There you go  Thank you sir  Later bruh  Alright  David Lee Roth 
[00:21:00]  Just turned into Dave Roth  He just turned into Dave Roth  The law firm of Dave Roth  Yeah I don't know  I have a feeling  He might have got some plugs  But now other hair around it  Is falling out  Yeah yeah yeah  So maybe he should go in  For a touch up  Something is just going on  Maybe he needs a little something  There's something going on there  I would just wear a lot of hats  Just wear hats  Figure out  Wow  That's when he first started losing it  When everyone started paying attention 
[00:21:30]  When he still kept it long  But it was obvious  He was losing it  He was ready to go into that  Jesse Ventura  Sure  Road there  It's hard for rock stars  When your hair starts going  It's like oh boy  Peter Frampton got nailed with that  Some of them  They keep that full head of hair  Their whole career  It's amazing  Ozzy has a full head of hair  Ozzy  Is it his?  Yeah Ozzy's hair is his  There's a few others  That really just  Didn't lose any of it  No  Who else do you think has full head of hair?  Jimmy Page  Does he? 
[00:22:00]  Whose birthday was yesterday  I think all of it Zeppelin  Right?  Plant  Robert Plant  Plant has that full head of hair  Still yeah  Well  Yeah but he has that huge rock head too  He has giant  A lot of head to cover  The hair falls off  But it never hits the ground  Which by the way  One of my greatest pictures ever  And it's not displayed  And that's thanks to Jim Norton  Because I wasn't going to ask for a picture  I was shy that day  And Jimmy basically pulled me back in  To get my picture  You have to with Plant  With Robert Plant  And he was an asshole  Who did me  Who did I tell recently 
[00:22:30]  I mean you just sat  I think Tom Papa  I'm like we just sat there  And watched him sing  It was just me and you  Like two chicks  Yeah  Like he was playing for his chicks  Two hot chicks  Yeah we're two hot chicks  And he was playing for us  Before the big show  Yeah warming up his vocals  He was good  He's gyrating his fucking ball bag  Fucking feet from me  Into his head  And he's better  Still has his hair  Chris Cornell  And I wound up loving that record  It was a good record  Loved it  Fucking the mighty rearranger  You know what  Robert Plant  Had a pretty damn good career 
[00:23:00]  After Zeppelin  You know  A lot of Zeppelin fans  Didn't dig everything  He went into  But he was very  Very successful  Very successful  But his head  Is fucking giant  Giant head  Giant  Giant head  Giant  Giant  Giant head  And then Master Poe  Someone had my picture  With Robert Plant  I want to retweet that  To show everyone  How big his fucking head is  Crazy freak  And Master Poe  Bodyguarded him for the day  And got us all our stuff signed  It was really nice of him 
[00:23:30]  Ah  Yeah  Mr. Plant  It was a big day for Master Poe  What band was he from?  Yeah he didn't even know  He did ask that  You're right  I thought he was from a salsa band  Mmhmm  He also asked about  Steven Tyler too  This Aerosmith  Are they a big deal?  Aerosmith  Aerosmith  You see the picture of  Steven Tyler on the beach  No but he has teats  World of Hurt  Wow  I mean he's an older gentleman now  Yeah  It's hard to keep it all together

Yeah  Yeah  What A cups look like  When you get over 60 years old  If you're abroad  Oh god  What's going on there?  Well he's  I mean he's closer to 70 man 
[00:24:30]  That's fucked up  How old is he?  60  He's right behind the Beatles  Believe it or not  So  If they're all pushing 70  Shaped like a lemon  I have a photo  I'm going to get a photo of him  62  And in one of the pictures  You can see that he has man boobs  Yeah  And I remember noticing that  When I saw him in person  Yeah  Yeah  Because the shirt he had on  Was tight  I was like wow  Geez  Oh yeah  The tattoo  Tattoo  The tattoo song sucks a dick

[00:26:00]  I thought it was the pit  I thought you were doing a pit  Not really  For the pit  Not really  That's my six years of Spanish in school  I don't know shit  Alright you're gonna fade out of this  Big long lead  Well there's a new song by Jay-Z as well today  Oh great  It's our musical segment  And it made Anthony very angry right before the show  I just cringed  Very angry  Why are you so angry?  Well this is another one of these self-important look at us moments 
[00:26:30]  Where alright Jay-Z and Beyoncé had their kid  They inconvenienced people at the hospital because of it  Yeah but I fault the hospital more than them  Well whatever you know  The hospital wanted that big donation  They got 1.3 million I'm hearing  But that basically meant that these guys were gonna shut down the hospital  And the hospital should have realized  Well fuck we gotta take care of other people that are having babies that day  They're all assholes  They should even have known as human beings 
[00:27:00]  If they're so tender and sensitive that they're writing fucking songs  A day after their kids are born  How about the other people?  No consideration for the other people that are having kids in the hospital?  Fuck Beyoncé and fuck Jay-Z  It was obviously written before the kid was born  Oh how could it be?  The kid's in it  Yeah  The kid already has a number one  It's like shut up  The kid's days old and has a number one  Oh  How self-important  Look at our little miracle  Shut up  There's a baby and he's crying 
[00:27:30]  Yes he is  You gotta throw a little rap in there  Well let's hear it  He should have played the placenta like a bagpipe  Just fucking squeezing it under his arm  Just blowing into the fucking umbilical cord  I had seen this one differently  I was mad at Jay-Z and Beyonce at first  But then when I heard about the 1.3 million dollars they spent 
[00:28:00]  You know gave the hospital because they wanted  Yeah  They wanted to do it their way  The hospital at that point could have said  No fucking way  We can't inconvenience all these other people  The hospital took the money  So they should have figured something out  Hey Jay-Z and Beyonce wants a wing  Right  But if I was having a kid that weekend  I would have been fucking livid  Because I guarantee  There was one guy  He couldn't even see his kids  They weren't told that that was happening  No one said to them  Look other parents are being shipped away  They're probably like  Yeah it's all handled 
[00:28:30]  It's good  So they just kind of came in  Right  Yeah  They don't know what's going on  They're just worried about the kid  I think the hospital is uh  You know  Yeah the hospital fucked everybody  It was really bad in this one  Mmhmm  Jay-Z's got a song  It's called um  Glory  Featuring Blue Ivy  Carter  Why Carter?  Is that his last name?  Yeah  Jay-Z has a last name  His name's Sean Carter  Really?  Right  Sean Carter  So why is he Jay-Z then?  Why doesn't he go by  Oh wait I'm  Oh yeah nevermind  Yeah but I was stuck with his name 
[00:29:00]  When I was 12  Jay's had that name for a while  Was he nicknamed Jay-Z at 12 years old?  I can't confirm or deny  Did he make his own name?  Because that's bad  I made Primetime Sam Roberts  It worked for a while  You made Primetime Sam Roberts?  I made that up  That's really bad  You never make up your own name  Everybody caught on with it  Yeah he did  Douchebag was the one  Everybody else gave him  Yeah  You let someone else  Come up with a name  That you kind of like  And all the other ones  That you don't like  You just don't acknowledge  And then when one comes along  That you do like  Like in my case 
[00:29:30]  Then you go with it  I made up Primetime Sam Roberts  In a California pizza kitchen  I was almost Will Robinson  You were?  Oh yeah  That's a good nickname  And I was almost Howdy Doody too  Oh no  But see when they were  Trying to do that shit with me  I just ignored them  And then Opie came along  I'm like alright  I can handle that one  You should have picked your own  But remember I was 12  Because now I fucking hate the name  I used to call you Will Robinson  Danger  Danger  We'd hide under the covers together  Yeah  Protect them  Protect them 
[00:30:00]  Yeah I'm sure  I'd put the little secret  The little secret  I'd hide it  When no one could find it  You remember that?  You little buttocks  I wonder where that was  Oh he tells  It's not even left for the imagination  I'd hide it  You know  In the buttocks  No because he had like really pale buttocks  And I'd pinch them so hard  That my fingerprints would be  Oh Jesus  Like little hunks of dough  That's repulsive  He'd push back on me  He'd go  Hide everything that was supposed to be hiding 
[00:30:30]  I'd go  Gregorio  God Jimmy  You really sound horrific  Jimmy's hacking up lung butter  The lung area  Yeah I don't know what that is  I've got to quit smoking Paul Maul  I wish I had turned on my Twitter earlier  Because people are trying to figure out  What Van Halen was saying in that song  And Angelo DeLeo I guess 
[00:31:00]  He says  Were they singing  String bean salad  Bludgeoned cat  That's what it sounded like  That song is so full of hooks  The album should be called Tackle Box  That's solo gangbang  That's a good one  Yeah  Yeah most  All right  On the Twitter  Most people don't like the fucking song  And I know we got some Van Halen fans out there  If you're a Van Halen song  Uh song 
[00:31:30]  Uh fan  And you like that song  You gotta call us  Yeah  I wanna hear the Jay-Z song  All right  It's called Glory  And it's featuring Blue Ivy Carter  I'm fucking half asleep still  I'll be honest with you  Stop it  You sound like a million bucks  No I don't  Uh here we go  Jay-Z's new song  Tattoo  The most amazing feeling I feel  Words can't describe  But I'm feeling for real  Shut the fuck up  What's wrong  Shut the fuck up 
[00:32:00]  It's everything Anthony doesn't like  Black people and babies  It's horrible  What's wrong man  Most amazing feeling I feel  Is it  How about when you shoved your dick in Beyonce  That was probably pretty amazing  Why do you hate Jay-Z  Cause he's an asshole  He's not an asshole  Fucking Beyonce and Jay-Z  Ooh the royal couple now  Has a child  Who gives a shit  No one wants to hear your dumb song  About your dumb kid  Shut up  Shut up  It sounds like  Shut up  It sounds like you give a shit 
[00:32:30]  No I  I hate stuff like this  Why  They're happy  Yeah they're happy  Great  You know how many other people  Are very happy with their kids  And lives and stuff  They're not talented  Yeah then they should get a song together  Exactly they're not either  Believe me  I should've got a little song  I should've got a little song together  For a little Hudson  This is horror listen  Fuck I should've came up with a song  Yeah  All I have to do is turn on a tape recorder  And just talk  Yo I'm doing radio  Yeah  God bless Jay-Z  I love his voice  I do 
[00:33:00]  But all he does is turn on a tape recorder  And just like  Whatever comes to his head  And then he gives it to a record guy  Oh that's brilliant  And they go  Alright put this out for me  There's more to it than that  No man he's just talking  Terrible  He's a modern day poet  I did some talking after my kid was born  Why didn't I fucking record that shit  You're not the poet that Jay-Z is  I would've went platinum  I'm feeling for real  Baby I paint the sky blue  My greatest creation was you  Creation  You  His greatest creation  Yes  Fucking speak 
[00:33:30]  That's how they speak  Oh god no  What  This is awful  And he's gonna paint the sky blue  Yeah  He's taking poetic license  With some of the words  That's fine  Great  Isn't the sky already blue  It's a double entendre type of thing  I don't get it  Because the daughter's name is blue  Yeah but the sky's already blue Sam  You can't paint it blue  You know how long that would take though  That would take a lot of fucking paint  Keeps just being poetic  Because the paint the sky  You're absolutely right  First of all your ladder  Be a little rickety  You'd have to climb up and down  Very high 
[00:34:00]  Be so cold up there  And you'd be painting  Like atmosphere  It wouldn't work  I would imagine you gotta get a ladder  That's about a mile high  You gotta get up about a mile  Huh  A lot higher than that  Nah I'm gonna go in a mile  I'll paint the sky blue  About a mile up  But how much do you paint it blue  Before anybody can notice  Yeah  You'd probably  After the first can of paint  He'd be like  Enough of this shit  Someone would be down there  Calling him  And they'd be going  Yo I don't even see that shit  And he'd be like  Ah that's a whole can  Motherfucker  Why did I sing about this 
[00:34:30]  Now I gotta do it  Shit  Paint the sky blues and shit  Let's hear more  His greatest creation  Well yeah he's happy  What a guy  Being a father makes you very happy  Does he have other kids there Sam  Who knows everything about Jay Z  Not confirmed  He has nephews  Oh of course yeah  He's got nephews  Yeah he's got nephews to look after  What's the deal with that  Well he's got nephews  He looks after his nephews  Will you give me a real answer  It's been rumored that he has some kids  Sure it's been rumored in the past  That he has illegitimate children  But  Wow that never happens 
[00:35:00]  But he's not gonna acknowledge  Any of those kids right  Well he  Desperations that he makes  People have  But he's  Stuck to the story  That he doesn't have any kids  He's got nephews  And there's never been any  Concrete proof  That he actually has children  Oh okay  I believe Jay Z  Oh I'll believe him  Yeah sure  Maybe I paint the sky blue  My greatest creation was you  You  Glory  Oh boy  He didn't know what to say there  No  He's letting it ride 
[00:35:30]  He didn't know what to say there Sam  He ran out of thoughts  He's letting it ride a little bit  Oh boy  Sam this fucking stinks  It doesn't  It's soulful  First of all  No one rhymes blue with you  Unless you're a hack  And then he had no other words  Over there  Yo  Yo  Maybe something will come to my head  I don't know what to say  It's real talk  It's been a great day  Yo  He's letting it ride a little bit  He's being soulful right now  I do like some Jay Z  But so far I'm not feeling this one  We're going to let it play  Let's give it a chance to breathe 
[00:36:00]  Oh okay  Thank you  You  Glory  Need words here  Need words here  No  Glory  Still don't have words  Still don't have words  Wait till  Wait  Watch this  Oh  False alarms and false starts  All made better by the sound of your heart  False alarms false starts  Oh those are the miscarriages  There's a lot of parents that can relate to that shit  See  Oh god  That's some miscarriage bullshit  And that's some truth 
[00:36:30]  Because that wasn't  Why would he sing about that  See you later  Stew tomato  Oh jeez  False starts  It's real talk  He wasn't  It wasn't public information  He's trying to be real with people  Well how about he leaves the miscarriage shit out of it  Because he's being real  Wow  Damn  He's not rapping about  Jerry Jolly Rancher in the toilet bowl  I like his voice actually  He's a great voice  You don't like his voice  I hate this shit  When some of this shit gets on the radio I'll listen  But I won't download Jay-Z stuff 
[00:37:00]  You should download all of it every hour  Really?  I don't own one Jay-Z  And I heard his book was amazing  It was  I heard it  I'm not even joking  I heard it was great  I want to read it  You should  It's very cool  He tells his life story through the lyrics of his songs  He deciphers his songs and explains what he meant when he was writing them  And that's how he tells his story  But it's not cheesy?  No it's not cheesy  It's good  It's really good  Once a kid gets a little older he's going to have to put that Velcro on the ceiling  Man hates black people 
[00:37:30]  He just hates them  I didn't say a word  Not for a minute  I am being so politically correct  I didn't say a thing  He hates them  He does  Can't stand them  Not for a minute  Not for a moment  There was one  Once  Wow  Let's be happy for Jay-Z today  Let's try something different  With his dumb song  He doesn't  Some rappers annoy me 
[00:38:00]  He doesn't  I never hear him doing anything  He never annoyed me until right now  With his dumbass fucking song  He annoyed you before  He's got a kid  Oh he did  Yeah  He's got his dumbass song about his dumbass kid  Who cares  This is how he expresses himself  Through his words  Exactly  And he's very happy right now  Fucking change a diaper and shut up  Fuck writing songs  His first child  Fuck writing songs  He's a songwriter  I know  Whatever  His first child that he's willing to acknowledge  This is good for him  It's his first child  This is really good for him  That he's willing to acknowledge 
[00:38:30]  It's his first child  It's a very important day for him  Screw all the nephews he had before this  This is the real one right here  The first one  This is his first child  Let's hear more  False alarms and false starts  All made better by the sound of your heart  Yeah  All the pain of the last time  I prayed so hard it was the last time  Your mama said that you danced for her  What?  Did you wiggle your hands for her? 
[00:39:00]  Glory  Glory  Glory  Glory  Sorry  Glory  What do you say?  Do you wiggle your ass for her?  Hands  Oh I heard ass  It's probably like an emotional thing  That happened in the delivery room  No I'm thinking  I'm thinking  That's belly shit  Kicking  Yes  Kicking  You know  Backing that shit up against Beyonce's fucking uterus wall  He didn't say ass  He backed that shit up  He said hands  Did you wave your  It's a very nice song about his baby 
[00:39:30]  The baby backed that shit up  You read the lyrics?  Yeah it's nice  It's nice right?  It's terrible  I like it  I think he's singing about the miscarriages a little too long though  I like his  How about we not sing about the miscarriages there  I like the way he sings  He's very  It's natural  Like he's keeping his accent  I like the way he  Lots of false starts  We thought it was a baby  It came out of thought  Miscarriages are just  Kind of hurt sometimes  That's horrible  In most cases  Miscarriages  Contraction  Are just late periods  Yeah there you go  Just really late periods 
[00:40:00]  There it is  Very late  Yeah  Yeah  Everything that I prayed for  God's gift  I wish I would've prayed more  God makes no mistakes  I made a few  Rough sledding here and there  But I made it through  I wreak havoc on the world  Get ready for part two  What?  A younger, smarter, faster me  He's swunging himself  A whole glass of B  Oh 
[00:40:30]  Get it?  Who's that guy?  For real  Pharrell  What?  That's Pharrell?

Damn it  What does little Hove mean?  I don't know what that  Hove  What does that mean?  J-Hove  God  Get the fuck out of here 
[00:41:00]  Jay-Z's nickname is Hove  From J-Hove  Oh his name is Hove?  Yeah yeah yeah  Oh  Because Jehovah  Is a word for God  Right  I thought it was being artistic  Is he calling himself God?  Yeah  I mean that's his old nickname  J-Hove  And now he's just Hove  That's why H to the is-O-V to the is-A  Spells Hove  Rock it the fuck off  I don't like the his-A thing  Self-important  I mean that's from 2001  Self-important  The his-A  Yeah I mean he did that song in 2001  Yeah  I think he probably should have spent a little more time on this 
[00:41:30]  If he wanted to get his feelings out  How about you don't just throw it out there like this  Give it a couple days  He doesn't write shit  What?  He doesn't write shit  He just lets it out  Oh he lets it flow  Yeah  Don't make fun of that  He doesn't write stuff  That's what we do every day  Well  We don't do shit  Is he a respected rapper?  He's extremely respected  Oh my god  Oh my god  Yes  I'm enjoying this  It's the greatest  It's not the greatest thing  Who's the chick in this  I know  For real

[00:42:30]  Hard not to spoil  You rotten  Looking like little me  The most beautifulest thing  In this world  Daddy's little girl  You don't yet know his swag is  But you was made in Paris  And mama woke up the next day  And shot an alpha package  Last time the miscarriage  Was so tragic  We was afraid you'd disappear  But nah baby  You magic  So there you have it  Shit happens  Just make sure the plane  You on is bigger  Than your carry-on baggage  That's a lot of words in there Sam  Something about carry-on baggage 
[00:43:00]  Break that shit down  He was shoving a lot of words at you right there  Yeah you gotta go one line at a time  It was hard to follow that  It's real shit  You were so beautiful to see  I was afraid to come out like Cherry's Jubilee  Well he's singing a lot about the miscarriages  He's mentioning it a couple of times  I like that  Not in the context of you  Oh okay  Maybe it's my mistake  I could write one of these  You didn't say Cherry's Jubilee  I thought  Because that's kind of me  If I was  If I was  What's her name  Blue Ivy  I'd be pissed off 
[00:43:30]  Yeah  Why you're just three days old  He cares more about the miscarriages  Than  He really is missing these miscarriages  Than her  Well he hasn't been able to express that emotion  About the  Because it's been so private  So now he's able to open himself up  Were they talked about before  Not at all  How about  It's the first time he's mentioning it  Yes  But how about you don't sing about everything  That has happened in your life  He's an artist  How about you sing about the Blue Ivy  And leave it at that  And paint the sky blue  Well he's mentioning what led up to it  I kind of like that  He's an artist  He's a true artist  I prefer to hear about the conception  He did a little bit mention the conception  What did he say  He said you were made in Paris 
[00:44:00]  Oh I didn't catch that  And then the next day  Beyonce shot an album package  How did you get that out of this song  Because I listened to the lyrics  So was I  Where was the Paris part  He banged Beyonce in Paris  And then the next day  She shot photos for her album  Wow how about that  Wait he says bang  No no  I'm breaking it down for you  You were made in Paris  He said you don't know yet  What swag is  So I guess they just made  The perfect child  Of course they did  Paris is like the perfect place  So you make sure she gets pregnant  Oh yeah  We were afraid you disappeared 
[00:44:30]  Like they were worried  That I guess  Another miscarriage  Yeah  They hate those miscarriages  They're terrible  Break this shit down  This isn't some tattoo shit  This is real shit  Breaking that shit down  This shit's for real  You making fun of tattoo  Yeah I am  This shit for real  You making fun of tattoo  Oh yeah  That shit's for real  Baggage  Everybody goes through stuff  Life is a gift  Love  Open it up  You're a child of destiny  You're the child of my destiny

Yeah  That's the actual baby crying?  From the delivery room  Great  Or is it the other parents crying  That they can't go see their baby?  That'll be good  No  I like his happiness  I like the glory part  Where glory  Yeah I didn't mind  That's Pharrell  The only thing I didn't like 
[00:48:30]  Pharrell  No not Scott Pharrell  Yeah  Pharrell from the Neptunes  I just didn't like the part  About the child  With destiny's child  A little much  It's a child  With a child  From destiny  Chow  And a chow  Chow  You think he likes the word child?  You know  Alright here's the last part  Because we  We get to hear the baby  Already in a song  Yay  Why did you play over this? 
[00:49:00]  Where's the kid?  Baby I paint the sky blue  Yeah  My greatest creation  Was you  Shut that kid up  Being boring  Thinks people want to hear that? 
[00:49:30]  Who's the other voice in there?  Is that Beyonce?  No it's not Beyonce  I don't know who the female  He got a shitty recording  Of his kid  He's probably on an iPhone  Or something  Yeah but he's Jay-Z  Yeah he's really bad  Yeah he probably didn't have  The sound  The room wired for sound  That explains why  They were so paranoid  About something going wrong though  Didn't have a fucking engineer  Come in with a mixing board  And mics  And mic the whole  Fucking hospital wing  Have Pharrell in there  Just doing matches  That is just terrible 
[00:50:00]  It's a beautiful song  That is a fucking horrid song  I thought it was nice  He's an artist  He's not  He's not an artist  Jay-Z?  Yeah he's  He's kind of an artist  Horrible stuff  It's terrible  He's able to portray his feelings  For all of us very well  And that's a very risky thing  For a rapper to do  To put themselves in such a vulnerable position  To show your emotions like that  That's not risky at all  Yeah it is in hip hop  It's not for Jay-Z  Yeah it is  They kill Jay-Z  That's exactly what they expect  From Jay-Z at this point 
[00:50:30]  Jay-Z gets killed  I don't know shit about hip hop  But I guarantee that's what's  What that's all about right there  Jay gets killed all the time  Yeah but he became a sensitive guy  Goes on Oprah and talks and stuff  You know come on  How long have they been together?  Jay and B?  Yeah  Eight months  Eight months  Several years  Yeah  Yeah I mean  They put 03 Bonnie and Clyde out  In 2003  So it was around then  Fuck  Everything annoys me  He's worth a billion dollars  He's worth more than that 
[00:51:00]  But he has a billion dollars  He has a billion dollars  He hasn't sold more than Eminem though  I don't think he has  I think I looked it up  It was like  Why does he have so much money?  Does he own a lot of stuff?  Is he  Yeah he owns a ton of stuff  He knows how to market  And he was one of the first  To really get a clothing line out  Like Rock Aware was one of the first  Big hip hop clothing lines  Is his stuff good?  Yeah  And it's still out there  And he was the CEO of Deptrip  Rock Aware?  What?  Dude  Is it big and fat?  Not Rock Aware  Oh  Stupid Rock  Rock Aware 
[00:51:30]  Yeah  Bird and Ernie's  Rock O  What is he doing?  I want to put out my own clothing line  Oh yeah?  Yeah  Yeah  That would be nice Jimmy  I don't know  But everything is going to be lime green  Lime green suits  Yeah  It's like a big check mark on the back  Oh that's good  Check yourself clothing  Check yourself  By Jim Norton  Check yourself  And like what happens is  Like on the collar sometimes  Is a big check 
[00:52:00]  A check  Like it's going to be like  Like a black shirt with a collar  Yeah  And a sky blue  Check  I like it  On his collar  It's actually pretty good  Check yourself clothing  Check yourself clothing  By Jim Norton  Check yourself  Oh check yourself  What is that?  It's like a phrase  But I won't say it like that  I'll say check yourself clothing  Check yourself  Not check yourself  Check yourself clothing  Yeah yourself would be one word  By Jim Norton  In Jimmy's case  Everything has checks on it 
[00:52:30]  A few years ago  Jay-Z was trying to copyright  A shade of blue  Like so the color itself  Was Jay-Z blue  And then license the color  To products  Jesus  So like you could get a computer  In Jay-Z blue  Or you could get  Oh my god  It didn't work  I didn't hear much about it  After he did it  Well  Did he think he has Gene Simmons?  Yeah but what blue was it  Before that?  He was just stealing  Somebody else's blue  No like he mixed it up  Like it was like a  They've created every blue  At this point  Stop  If I had to go to a Crayola box  And pull out a Crayon  That I think was akin to Jay-Z 
[00:53:00]  And I think I know  Which one I pull out  Blue?  No  Oh  And he was the CEO  Of Def Jam for a while  What?  He was the CEO of Def Jam  What?  For  Get it?  Yep  Def  All right enough about the Jay-Z  Congratulations to the happy couple  Yeah that's great  Yes  Yep  Good for them  Good for them  Our food's here  We got 
[00:53:30]  He liked it  Oh fantastic  It was  He just threw that out there soon  He didn't throw it  Are you kidding me?  That was a good song  I mean  If that's what he just throws out there  Then he's incredible  Wow  I just didn't like the line about Destiny's Child and Child  He rhymed Child with Child  Child  Child and Child  It's a play on words  No one does that  But there's a play on words  And there's only one line in the song  It's like when you said  I'm not a businessman  I'm a businessman  That's Kanye West  But died a businessman  No it's a Jay-Z line on a Kanye song  Oh 
[00:54:00]  Who knows  Wait a minute  Now hold on  That's Jay-Z saying that?  Mm-hmm  That's uh  I'm not a businessman  I'm a businessman  That's a really uh  Great line  I thought that was Kanye West saying that  No it's Jay  Well what is Kanye doing in that song?  It's his song  I mean Jay's just on the remix  Jay  But he says that on his verse  But wait  I didn't know what the difference between his verse and Kanye's verse was  It's Diamonds  From CRO  Diamonds are forever yeah  Oh  But I thought that was all Kanye West 
[00:54:30]  Like I don't know rap that well  Make sure it's the remix  Yeah please  Don't get the other Diamonds version that I wrote  You wrote one?  Yes I did  Sam you're black  I'm not black  I think you are  And better than ever  What?  Oh  What are we doing?  Eating  You want to hear this real fast?  I didn't know it was Jay-Z  I've listened to the song  I like this song a lot  Let's go to break with it then  It's a good song  It's a very good song  It's a really good song  Alright it's a Jimmy pick  Let's go to break with Diamonds are forever  Alright  Kanye West with Jay-Z 
[00:55:00]  That's Jay-Z  They are all I need to please me  They can stimulate to tease me  They won't leave in the night  I've no fear that they might desert me  Diamonds are forever  Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe  Diamonds are forever 
[00:55:30]  The rock is still alive every time I rhyme  Forever ever  Forever ever  Ever ever  Ever ever  Ever ever  Ever ever  Ever ever  Ever ever  Good morning  This ain't Vietnam still  People lose hands  Legs  Arms  For real  Little was known  On Sierra Leone  And how we connect to the Diamonds we own  When I speak of Diamonds in this song  I ain't talking about the ones that be glowed  I'm talking about Rockefeller, my home  My chain  These ain't conflict Diamonds 
[00:56:00]  Is they Jacob?  Don't lie to me, man  See a part of me saying  Keep shining  How  When I know where the blood Diamonds  Though it's thousands of miles away  Sierra Leone  Connect to what we go through today  Over here  It's the drug trade  We die from drugs  Over there  They die from what we buy from drugs  The Diamonds  The chains  The braces  The charms  I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless  Till I seen a picture of a shorty armless  And here's the conflict  It's in a black person's soul  To rock that gold 
[00:56:30]  Spend your whole life  Trying to get that ice  On a polar rugby  It looks so nice  I got something so wrong  Make me feel so right  Right?  Before I beat myself up like Ike  You can still throw your rock  A full of Diamond at night  Because  Throw your Diamonds in the sky  If you feel the vibe  The Diamonds out forever  The rock is still alive  Every time I rhyme  Forever, ever  Ever, ever  Ever, ever  Ever, ever  Ever, ever  Ever, ever  Ever, ever  People asking me 
[00:57:00]  Is I'm gonna gear my chain back  That'll be the same day  I gear the game back  You know the next questions are  Yo, where Dame at?  Let's track the Indian dance  To bring our rain back  What's up with you and Jay, man?  Are y'all okay, man?  Yup  I got it from here  Yeah, damn  The chain remains  The gang is intact  The name is mine  I'll take blames for that  The pressure's on  But guess who ain't gonna crack?  Pardon me  I had to laugh at that  How could you Walter?  When you the rock  What your balls are? 
[00:57:30]  I had to get off the boat  So I could walk on water  This ain't no tall order  This is nothing to me  Typical takes a day  Impossible takes a week  I did this in my sleep  I sold kilos of coke  I'm guessing I could sell CDs  I'm not a businessman  I'm a businessman  Me handle my business, damn  Kanye's, you got me  Freeweight and Foxy  YG's, Pierre Marie  Petey, watch me  Bleed could be one  Hit away his whole career  As long as I'm alive  He's a millionaire  And even if a guy's  In my will somewhere  So he could just kick back 
[00:58:00]  And chill somewhere  Oh yeah  He don't even have to  Write rounds of dice  Like my money lasts  Three lifetimes  Shelly Dash is in a prayer  Saying exactly what I was saying  Practically my whole career  The diamond is fab  Bobbing mine  And it's whatever  Now the lonely baton  Dawn's probably good  We got up  People lined up  To see the Titanic sinking  Instead we rose from the ash  Like a phoenix  If you're waiting for the end  The dynasty sign  It would seem like  Forever is a mighty long time  I'm young bitches 
[00:58:30]  Good night  This  Is the O.P. and Anthony Show  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  Yeah  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show  One, two, three, four  Well she was just 17 
[00:59:00]  You know what I mean  And the way she looked  Was way beyond compare  So how could I dance  With another  Oh and I saw her stand there  Get in topical  Hold up  Wait a minute  With the Sex Man 
[00:59:30]  Good morning sexy  Good morning  What do we got today?  Uh well  The Beatles first album  In the United States  Introducing the Beatles  Was released 48 years ago today  Damn  48 years ago  Damn that's a lot of years  Crazy  What was on that album?  This?  Uh yeah  This was the  It's been a good one  For that  Misery  Anna Go To Him  Chains  Boys  Love Me Do 
[01:00:00]  P.S. I Love You  Love Me Do  I like to love  Love Me Do  Do you like to love  Love Me Do?  Oh yeah  It's all pleasant  Yeah  Nice  This is still good  I got the Beatles box set  A couple years back  And I decided I want to  Track through the whole thing  Just blow off the  First few discs  Yeah  Unlistenable  Some of them are  They're like remakes  Of like 50's songs  Oh that real early stuff  Yeah  You know  Songs they kind of buried  Because  I don't know 
[01:00:30]  It was like rockabilly  It was  I don't even know  It was like almost  Doo-wop-y  Yeah yeah it was  It's almost  Unrecognizable  As Beatles songs  The original  Let it be stunk  Try to change it  I didn't care for that  At all  Mother Mary comes in  And she whispers  Words of wisdom  Yeah  Try to change it  Try to change it  Yuck  Hey Jude 
[01:01:00]  I'm glad I didn't go into that one  The original version was called  Does anybody know where I can get a hold of Jude  Yeah turn this off 
[01:01:30]  We're rocking  I hate rockabilly  You know like rockabilly  Not a big rockabilly fan either  Yeah I know  It's one song really  That they just redo  Over and over again  By the way  You rocked  Good job on the  TV smashing yesterday  Yes it was  A very nice video  That you put up  You enjoyed it  Yes very much so 
[01:02:00]  No I mean  Just enjoyed the experience  Oh the experience  Was fantastic  The video's easy  If you can't make a video out of somebody smashing something  Then get out of the biz  But you enjoyed  You know  Smashing something of Sam's right  It was a lot of fun  Yeah  I was just hoping that it would have made a bigger explosion with the glass  But  What are you kidding me  The sound of that is unbelievable  Yeah  Matter of fact I want the sound on my machine  Okay  It's going to be my car crash sound  Yeah it was  It was very  Oh  Oh man 
[01:02:30]  Oh man  Wow  Looks like you stepped on it  A rock's not done though  You put the video up on the Facebook page  Yeah that's up on Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony  Very good  Alright  Nice  Where are we going  We got Alex Jones calling in today  Yeah he always  What are we calling him  He's always willing to get on the line  Which I like  He's an asshole  But he's a willing 
[01:03:00]  At least he's willing to get on the line  No he really is an asshole  What's  Why are you laughing at that Sam  He's willing to get on the phone  It was just so funny  Like Jim was like  Giving him the benefit of a doubt  Type of thing  You know you gotta say  It's always nice  That he is willing to get on the phone  And you just  Snap right to it  Don't forget  He's a fucking asshole  Why would you want to listen to a radio show  That has the exact same voice  I like it  It's funny  Alright  It's a comedy show  Even dumb  Stupid  Different shit  It's very funny  But he  I'll tell you why he's an asshole  Because he went on his show  And said that  That we were in on a conspiracy 
[01:03:30]  And we scripted the whole interview  With Chris Kyle  That's why he's a fucking asshole  Always  Because he knows damn well  That we weren't in on it  But I guess he has to play in that  In that arena  Yeah  Everything has to be a conspiracy  And everyone has to be in on it  The government's involved  Things have to be scripted  Get the fuck out of here  The best part of it is  That even if it was  Some kind of a  Pre-hatched plan  Be careful what you say  Because he'll replay this  And say  See look  They're admitting it right here 
[01:04:00]  But even if it was  Do you honestly think  It would go all the way up  To the government  Like it's  He said it was a  Government conspiracy  Right  Yeah  We've had such a great relationship  With the government  And I love how Bill O'Reilly  Just flat out stole our  Our big exclusive  Ah  He spun it his way  Everyone is just focusing  On the Bill O'Reilly interview  With Chris Kyle  Yeah  But we were the first to have that  And we got the info  Out of the guy  It's also a video  It helps with this video  Because they can show it  We got a video  Oh you're right 
[01:04:30]  You know what we do  We filmed that day  You are correct  Oh my god  It's exhausting to see  The comments  On this fucking video  By the way  They are just  Coming out of the woodwork  Who  On the Chris Kyle interview  You got hardcores on both sides  Oh yeah  Jesse's fans  You got Jesse's  Jesse's fans  They're all assholes  I wish I was  Jesse's fans  They really think  That he's  They really think  That he's telling  He's  He's talking  Truth to power 
[01:05:00]  You know  They're such dopes  Please  Well we could play  Jesse Ventura  Talked about our video  In the Bill O'Reilly interview  I believe  You want to hear this real fast  I'm sure it's riveting  Or maybe I think  They're just focusing  On Bill O'Reilly now  Now that it's  Bill O'Reilly's story  Yeah of course  Ventura responds  To  To  The punch  Thing  On Alex Jones  Rambles for six straight minutes  Nice  So this is Jesse Ventura  His side of the story  If you don't know 
[01:05:30]  We had  Navy SEALs  Sharpshooter  Chris Kyle on  And  It was a great hour  Of radio man  Really a lot of fun  I believe  I believe  A pretty good interview  And then he admitted  That he  Punched  And pretty much  Knocked  Jesse Ventura  Down to the ground  For talking some shit  Yup  And Alex Jones  Thinks  It didn't happen  And that we were  In on a conspiracy  And we scripted  The whole thing  With Chris Kyle  Well he finally  Got Jesse Ventura  On his show  And this is what  Jesse had to say  Governor Jesse Ventura 
[01:06:00]  We've seen  A big national news story  Claiming that  This Navy SEAL  Who just had a book  Come out this week  At a bar  Knocked you down  And then ran away  Because you were saying  You were glad  That Navy SEALs  Were dead  I mean it sounds  Like something  Out of the Twilight Zone  Well Alex  Anyone that's ever  Well Alex  Right off the bat  Well Alex  Let me tell you something  You  You can believe 
[01:06:30]  What you want  Oh God  That voice  I guess we're out  To ruin his reputation  Right  Yeah his great reputation  Yeah  A fighter  Well Alex  Anyone that's ever  Heard me talk  Knows that that's  Not true at all  I have no idea  Why this person  Is saying it  Or for what purpose  It's to serve  But you know  If he stated that he struck me  Knocked me down  And then fled  I want people to understand 
[01:07:00]  Clearly  He's confessing them  To the crime of assault  And it's assault on a former governor  An elected official  A former elected official  Twice  I want to clear his name  Because he's confessing  To assaulting me  And it didn't happen  I can unequivocally tell you  That I've never been punched  In Coronado, California  Since I've been out of the Navy  I got out of the Navy  In active duty 
[01:07:30]  In 1973  And I've never been struck  By anyone  I've been out there  Multiple times  For reunions  That are the third weekend  In August  Every year  And this may have been  The graduation  What he's talking about  In 06  Of class 258  Because it's traditional  That when 100 years  I was class 58  When 158 graduated back  I believe in the 80s  I went to that graduation  Because that's a tradition 
[01:08:00]  And then when 258 graduated  Oh my god  He's losing everybody  Now I understand  What Danny was saying  Danny was 258 graduated  Danny had this audio  And he told us  Look I can't cut this audio  Because the guy  Never took a breath  And there's no way to cut it  He just rambles  For six straight minutes  I don't know if it happened  No I don't either  So far  It seemed believable  At the time  When we asked Chris Kyle  So far what he's saying  Is 
[01:08:30]  It's kind of convincing  Like when he first said  He's confessing to assault  I'm like he's just trying  To give Chris Kyle  A way to deny it  Like hey I'll sue you  He can't fucking sue him  He can't do anything  But uh  I don't know  Chris Kyle did seem  Kind of convincing  And he didn't mention it  In the book  Yeah  He seemed very convincing  Yeah  And Jesse's just been  Like you know  When you watch his show  You listen to some of the stuff  He said  Everything I've heard  From Jesse  I've just interpreted it 
[01:09:00]  As bullshit  Yeah  So you know  I'm gonna take the  The word of somebody  That seems a little more  Trustworthy  As far as their words go  Well what he said  I'm sorry  He didn't say that he said  I'm glad Navy SEALs  Are getting killed  No that's fucking  He said Jesse said  Alex  You guys gotta take  It's good you guys  Take a few or something  Yeah  Whatever it was  He misquoted Kyle  Alex has misquoted Kyle  Throughout this thing  Like I've never heard  Anyone misquoted before 
[01:09:30]  Yeah  Horrid  Isn't there anyone  That could back up  Chris Kyle's story  Yeah  It was probably  Other people that were  In the bar I guess  So we need one of those guys  To come forward I guess  Yeah  Right  Yes  And then when  258 graduated  In 2006  I believe it was  I went to that  But  And McP's bar  Is owned by  Doc McPartland  Who was my  SEAL cadre instructor  When I just came out  Of training  He instructed me  In SEAL SBI SEAL basic indoctrination 
[01:10:00]  And he owns that establishment  And I would never ever misbehave  In the Doc's establishment  I have too much respect for him  And if people truly want to clear this up  Call him  Call McP's  Because if a former governor  Within the SEAL community  Had been knocked down  And hit and assaulted  It would have traveled through the SEAL community  Like wildfire  And for this to now  Say it happened 
[01:10:30]  Five and a half  Or six years  After it happened  That's absurd  But I want to state  That even though  This person  Is confessing  To committing a crime  Against me  Of assault  I want to state  Unequivocally  He is not guilty  Of that crime  Because he never hit me  I don't even know  Who he is  I'm  If I've met him or not  I don't know it  Just he's sounding  Pretty believable  I like the part  Where he says  It would have went through  The SEAL community  Like wildfire 
[01:11:00]  People said it did  But where are those guys  Yeah I don't know  I'm playing both sides of this one  Like where are those guys now  Like who could collaborate his story  Yeah  But then again  There's gotta be one guy  Why would Chris  This is what bothers me about this  Chris Kyle makes it up  He makes it up  Like in a  I punched him in a bar  In front of people  Like to me  A smart lie would be  I punched him in the hallway  And it's your word against hate  Or in the alley  After we were all done  Yeah  Or walk into our cars  Or whatever  Or it was me and him  In the men's room 
[01:11:30]  And I fucking punched him  Right  Where there's no witnesses  Where there's no witnesses  To say it happened in plain sight  You're literally opening yourself up  Yeah  To 50 people in the bar  Going you're lying  You didn't hit him  We saw the whole thing  You did nothing  Right  I mean  But someone has to come forward  For Chris Kyle at this point  Yeah  Who has more of a motive to lie  Chris to sell books  Or Jesse to save face  Chris selling books  He did not mention it  In the book  He mentioned punching someone  He did not mention who it was  Right  Why wouldn't you mention who it was 
[01:12:00]  Then again maybe he was afraid  Of getting sued  Then again I kind of like the fact  He didn't mention who it was  Because he wasn't  You know  I don't know how to feel about it  This is confusing  But the one thing  That's not confusing  Is the fact that  We were not in on this  Idiot  We asked a few questions  And that's what happened  Got a tip  That this happened  So we asked him  Yeah  You know  But according to Alex Jones  We were in on it  And we scripted the whole fucking thing  That's how it worked  He's going to be calling in what  20 minutes  This Alex Jones  Oh great 
[01:12:30]  He's going to use his real voice  Or his radio voice  Radio voice  Even from home  Absolutely  Damn  He'll have that fast talking  Radio voice on  Oh god  Jesse continues  Oh does he  His name  I don't even know it right now  As I talk to you  I just know that he  He made accusations  That he hit me  Back in 06 I guess  And that he fleed the bar  Can I  I shouldn't have looked down 
[01:13:00]  At my Twitter  The horse  AMF  Last tweet I read from you  I don't deal with anybody anymore  No backpedaling Jim and Opie  Starting to sound like the other jocks  It's not backpedaling  We're not backpedaling at all  When you hear something  And you hear the other side of an argument  Would you rather  That I stubbornly stuck to it  Or I told you honestly  After hearing Ventura  Who I don't like  His explanation  Right  Okay  Now I wasn't there  So would you rather I be ignorant 
[01:13:30]  And like pretend I'm like Alex Jones  And go  This is what happened  I know  Right  I don't know  Because I wasn't there  Right  And Alex Jones should say  The exact same thing  When Chris Kyle told the story  Like holy fuck  He sounds very believable  Not backpedaling you  Don't  But now that I'm hearing  Jesse Ventura  I have questions  And that's how you should do this shit  You idiot  It takes a brave person to go  Wow you know what  I got more questions now  Instead of sticking to your initial thought  I believe Chris Kyle  There's certain ways Jesse is saying it 
[01:14:00]  That also does give me pause  Like he's saying  I'm admonishing him of that crime  Or he's confessed  Like why would you say  He's confessing to a crime  It's almost like you're trying  To put it in his head  Don't push this  Right  Why not just say  That guy's a liar  He never touched me  And can he sue still  He could sue for making up  A fake story right  I don't know if it's defamation  Is it defamation  Or what he said  Something like that  Maybe  Who knows  Look I'm not a fan  Of Jesse Ventura at all  But the one thing 
[01:14:30]  That resonates certainly  Is when he said  This would have went through  The Navy SEAL community  Like a wildfire  And you gotta think  It would have  But are those guys  Under this thing  Where they keep it  Among themselves  And they don't openly  Talk about it  Yeah maybe it's just  One of those things  That everybody knows about  Apparently other people  Did know about it  Yeah  Who knows  That makes me suspicious  And that makes me  Want to ask more questions  You fucking idiot  Or  You're like Troy Kwan  Unless Chris Kyle  Just punched a  Unless he just 
[01:15:00]  Punched an older guy  Yeah  Riff raff  Is that a riff raff  Unless he just  Punched an older guy  And then when a guy  Called in and had heard  It was Jesse Ventura  Right  And then Chris Kyle  Went oh that sounds  Rocky Horror was in town  Maybe  And they were at the same bar  Yeah  Alright let's see  What else Jesse says here  Fleet the bar  If that was true Alex  Maybe I should go up  Since he's confessing  To a crime  Maybe I should go up  And file the charges  There are  And if he did do this 
[01:15:30]  And said police  Were coming  Or whatever it was  He stated  Wouldn't there be  A police report  I can assure you  There is  I'm gonna pause again  It sounds like  He could still  File the charges  So Jesse's gotta  File charges  Or he looks like  An idiot here  He's talking too much  About the charges  Right  That to me  Right  That's like saying  You know  Cause I could sue you  I could sue you  You're just trying  To put that  In someone's head  I'm gonna file charges  And if your reputation  Is on the line  Then why not  Go file the charges  Let's play this out 
[01:16:00]  There Jesse  Yeah  Right  This is a weird  Weird  Weird situation  Yeah  If one guy  Like backed up  Chris Kyle  Then I wouldn't  Have a doubt  In my mind  And hopefully  That'll happen  If this story  Continues to grow  Yeah we'll see  The police report  I can assure you  There isn't one  And I can assure you  This event  Did not happen  Nobody has ever  Hit me  When I've been up there  Since I've been  Off active duty  Let me categorize that 
[01:16:30]  I got off active duty  In 73  Macho man  Nobody there  Have I ever been  In any trouble  Or did anything  But reunions  And graduations  Or whatever it might have been  Or retirement  And the thing is  You're never at  McPee's alone  You're there  With your teammates  And your classmates  And you're all celebrating  When you go to  McPee's  There'll be at least  Five or six guys  With you  Well I would sure  Like to hear 
[01:17:00]  Of a witness  That saw  Of this event  Because it never  Happened  It's plain  And that simple  And what does  Concern me  Is that  This is two times  Now within about  A two week period  Where the mainstream  Media has  Has ran  With something  That was completely  Untrue  As you know  Pause that real quick  The thing is this  You're not willing  To come on this show  So it's not like  We could have  Called you  At that moment  And we couldn't  Have called you  The next day  Because you refused  To come back on  Since you were  Scolded 
[01:17:30]  And you were  Apparently unreachable  Even Alex Jones  Couldn't get a hold of you  So stop acting  Like the mainstream media  Just ran with it  Without contacting you  Where apparently  You're really hard  To get a hold of  Well  In all fairness to Jesse  That the mainstream media  Does that all the time  Yeah  I think Jesse's a dick  But our video  Is just what it is  It happened  We put it out there  We didn't even  Try to spin it  Or anything  This is this guy's story  Wow  This is a big story  Can we get Chris Kyle  Back on the phone  Or something  That would be kind of cool 
[01:18:00]  Yeah let's do that  Is there a possibility  They're checking into it  Yeah let's  No spin zone here  Jesse continues  You want to  Keep going with this  Oh please  Alright  That was completely  Untrue  As you know  They stated that  I was tailgating  A car a couple weeks  To go out in the  San Fernando Valley  On the way to the airport  And that was solely  Not true  Because I haven't been  To California  For six months  And I haven't flown  In an airplane  For 15 months  And you can attest  To that  Because you were with me 
[01:18:30]  The last time  I flew in a commercial  Airliner  And that was over  Well over a year ago  So it's two times  Now that  That bogus  Serious  False stories  Have been perpetuated  Out there  By the mainstream  Media against me  And I guess  Alex  I can only say  Maybe because  I'm rattling  My sword  About the elections  Maybe because  I support  Ron Paul  Who's not  Popular  Or they say  He's fringe  Because 
[01:19:00]  Please stop  With that shit  I mean  I kind of like  Ron Paul now too  But he's not  Going to get elected  So no one's  Panicking over  Oh my god  We got to shut down  Everyone that's  Supporting Ron Paul  So you got to  Stop with that argument  And Jesse's already  Have a shitty enough  Reputation where  No one thinks  They need to  Shut him up  No  Not at all  Right  It's because  I support  Ron Paul  That's not what  It is  So they got to  Shut me down  So the government's  After him  That's dumb  Let's get the  Bar owner on the phone  Popular or whatever  Or they say  He's fringe 
[01:19:30]  Because he stands  For peace  Maybe because  I support peace  And not war  In this country now  That makes you  A target  For the people  That do support war  I don't know  I'm only speculating  There but  I'll let you  Have it Alex  And you can speak  But I just want  To tell you  Unequivocally  This event  Did not happen  And he stands  For peace  Maybe because  I support peace  And not war  In this country now  That makes you  A target  For the people  That do support war 
[01:20:00]  I don't know  I'm only speculating  There but  I'll let you  Have it Alex  And you can speak  But I just want  To tell you  Unequivocally  This event  Did not happen  And I can't speak  To anything else  That this person  Would say  Because I don't  Know him  To my knowledge  I've never ever  Even met him  Maybe I have  I don't know  But you know  You meet a lot  Of the younger guys  But you don't  Recall who they are  But never  Have I ever been hit  Or treated  Disrespectfully  In the Navy 
[01:20:30]  UDT seal community  At McPee's bar  Or any official  UDT seal function  In any way  In fact I'm treated  With honor and dignity  At all times  So I don't know  Where this story  Or why this young  Gentleman wants to  Plead that he  Committed a crime  Against me  But I can  Unequivocally  Plead for his  Innocence  Because the event  Never happened  Governor  He  Yeah  Governor Jesse Ventura  Joins us  From Mexico  Down on the Baja  Via audio 
[01:21:00]  Mexico  We got a guy  On Twitter  I won't give out  His name there  But he says  Seals don't discuss  Shit in their community  With those outside  Their community  Jesse knows this  He's lying  Wow  So they got  That code  Well  The code  And then someone  Else is saying  It's very suspicious  The weird part  Is when Chris Kyle  Said he ran away 
[01:21:30]  Yeah why would you  Admit that  If you hit another guy  The last thing you  Want to admit to anyone  Is yeah I hit him  And I ran  Because I was scared  You know what I mean  Yeah  You could easily  He could easily  Have left that  Out of the story  Well we were asking  Like what happened  Then  What happened next  No I know  I know  So it's kind of odd  Eh I don't know  What do you think  Ant  I don't know  Are you backpedaling  I just know Jesse  Is  Are you backpedaling  Are you  I know Jesse 
[01:22:00]  Is  Has told some things  That I have  Found inconsistent  Over the years  So  Now who knows  Yeah I didn't  I didn't have an opinion  On this  Either way  All I knew  As a radio guy  Holy shit  We got something cool today  Let's put this on the internet  That's all I was thinking  Yeah  I don't know Chris Kyle  I don't know his friends  I don't know the bar owner  Well I was a Navy SEAL  And we don't talk about stuff  Oh  It sounded  It sounded convincing  And that's all I know  Thank you for your service 
[01:22:30]  I was a SEAL  I was bouncing a ball  And five things  Balls across the nose  But now Ventura  Sounds like  There's some things in there  Yeah but I find that  Who has a bigger reason  They both have reasons to lie  Let's be honest  Jesse to save face  And again Chris  To sell books  Yeah but he had  A hell of a fucking career  Why would you take that chance  To sell a few books  No I'm just saying  Yeah yeah you're right  It doesn't make sense  Why would you take that chance  You had an amazing career  It's almost  And you got this private company now 
[01:23:00]  That it  You know  A lie like this  Could hurt that  Right  Yeah  So I don't know  What his motive would be  To lie  It doesn't seem like  There's an upside  Unless it was something  Unless it was  A bullshit thing  That was going around  For a while  Like a rumor  That he kind of embraced  Because it raised his profile  And then when it got mentioned  Publicly  He was like  Ugh  Again  I still believe Chris Kyle  Yeah Jesse's been known  To fly off the handle 
[01:23:30]  And say some fucked up shit  You know  I believe Chris Kyle  For the little knowledge  I got on this whole thing  And I'll tell you why  I have trouble believing Ventura  Because our whole interview  Which people who criticized me  For the interview I had with him  With you filming  You didn't get every part of it  Because you only had a one hour flip  So you would turn it on and off  So I always love when people  I think there's a longer version  Up there now  Oh there's the audio there is  Yeah  But people who didn't hear  The whole thing  Think I just attacked him  And he's like  Yeah I was  But you weren't being a gentleman  You were being an asshole  He was being an asshole 
[01:24:00]  And I was  Hearing the way he spun that  I was like  You phony  You don't sound like  You're being  You're not a gentleman  You weren't being nice  You were insulting  Yeah  You're being rude  And he was getting more  And more frustrated that day  Because we kept asking  More and more questions  We just didn't let him  Just slide  With some vague shit  Yeah  Alright we're going to talk  To Alex Jones about this  In a few minutes  Yes we are  Damn it  You know what we could do  We could break  When we get back  We'll have Alex Jones  On the phone  And we say hi

[01:26:00]  Hey guys  How y'all  Turn the music off  Turn the music  Jesus  Jesus  Sorry Chris  Rock radio  I guess E-Rock was enjoying  Down with the sickness  Yeah  Yeah  He was doing it for his own pleasure  Hi Chris  How are you  What's up Chris  Not much  How y'all doing  Well  Good buddy  You told the story on our show  That you punched Jesse Ventura  In a bar  And wow  The story took off man  Was this the first place  You'd ever told that story 
[01:26:30]  Publicly  Yeah  Well yes  I mean  For a big audience like that  I mean  The event is in the book  But I purposely left his name out  Right  Because I didn't want that whole thing  To take off like that  And then  Ever since then  I've been trying to  Kind of deflect questions from it  Because  Not trying to make money off of  Putting him down  Or anything  Yeah  Yeah  We got a tip  That it was Jesse Ventura  We asked you  And you decided to  Say yes to that  And admit it was Jesse Ventura 
[01:27:00]  Because like you said  In the book  It's very vague  You said you punched a guy  Fuzzy face guy  Was it  Was that the exact  Yeah  Scruffy face  Scruffy face  Right  Right  Well a lot of people  Are now calling you a liar  Including  I believe you by the way  Yeah so do I  Yeah  So far we believe you  Absolutely  They can call me  Whatever they want  Because I know  This thing has  Gotten so blown up  That the only way  To actually put it to rest  Is the witnesses  I have asked them 
[01:27:30]  To stay out of it  Where finally now  I've said  You know what  Just go ahead  Come out with it  Oh okay  And we can put this behind us  Oh you have actually  Asked them to speak up  Because there was audio  We heard of Ventura  Of course  You probably heard it too  Where he's denying  Ever meeting you  And he's harping on the fact  That a crime  Has been committed  And maybe he should  File charges  Yeah  He definitely should  If he thinks that's right  Do you regret it  At all  You know what 
[01:28:00]  I wish I would have  Handled it differently  I mean  I don't  I mean  The story  I think definitely  Needed to be in the book  Like it is  But as far as  Yeah I probably  Should have  Played it down  To where his name  Didn't get out there  But you know what  It is now  So  What exactly happened  Chris  If you could just refresh  Because a lot of people  Might not have heard you  On that moment  Just if you could give us  A brief  Just kind of  Sum the story  So people know  What we're talking about 
[01:28:30]  It was a wake  For Mikey  And of course  All the families  Were there  He was there  I started  Getting loud  And voicing his opinion  Coming out against the war  And the troops  And everything  So we asked him  To keep it down  And he got  Belligerent about it  And finally said  We deserve to lose a few  Yeah that's  Way over the line  Now was he  He was there  This was in a bar  Just so people know  Yes 
[01:29:00]  It was the  Outside patio portion  Of a bar  And we were standing  On the sidewalk of it  Now was he with anybody  Or was he alone  To your knowledge  No I mean  He was definitely  There at the bar  With people  Oh he was with people  So there's a few people  That saw this  Oh there's a bunch  Of people that saw this  Yeah and they've  Spoken about it  Like in smaller  Circles over the years  It's not like  This has been  A complete secret  Oh no  I mean the entire  Community has known  About this  And there's a room 
[01:29:30]  Like there's a radio guy  Who's friends with  Jesse Ventura  Who thinks that  We all scripted this together  I guess because  Obie just happened  To look over  Yeah  And at the instant feedback  Which is the one time  Instant feedback  Actually you know  Gave us something helpful  Actually it was a phone call  Oh a phone call  Okay  It seemed like  It might have been  Someone that really  Knows Chris Kyle  And was kind of just  You know hoping  That you were finally  Going to mention the name  But Alex Jones says  That it's a conspiracy  We were in on the conspiracy  Even though we just  Met you that morning  And by the way  We thought you  Were awesome 
[01:30:00]  Yeah  We think you're  The greatest  People loved you  On the show man  And they also  Alex Jones also says  We scripted the whole thing  So we helped you along  And we got together  And we came up  With this whole thing  Right  I've heard all those rumors  Jesse was the wrestler  He did the scripted stuff  Not  Right  Not other people  And also  I love how Chris Kyle  Is admitting that  He told us first  Because Bill O'Reilly  Took this fucking story  And stole it from us  That cocksucker  That cocksucker 
[01:30:30]  Yeah he kind of ran with it  Like he just  Whatever  Well we got  We got Alex Jones  On the line too  He wants in on this  You cool with that Chris?  Definitely  All right  Hey Alex  Hey guys  Hey Alex  Welcome to the  Opie and Anthony show  Hey I like the show  Also like Norton  When he's on the boneyard  Thank you very much man  Don't kiss ass right now  Well we got  No no no no  Let's not kiss anyone's ass  Right now  All right  Hey hey  I actually listen to that channel 
[01:31:00]  I mean so I'm just saying  I listen to you  You're kissing a little ass  Because you know  You're in a tough spot  Right now sir  Why did you call us liars  And why did you  Say that we were in  On a conspiracy  With Chris Kyle  And that we scripted this thing  Okay well number one  I'm not in a tough place  I was just trying to be friendly  I just woke up  About 15 minutes  No no no  You're in a tough place  No I'm not in a tough place  Jesse Ventura  Lied on your show  InfoWars.com  Jesse Ventura  Lied on your show sir  Alex so what happened  You thought that we scripted  This with Chris Kyle  Which is ludicrous  What are you thinking there 
[01:31:30]  No let me tell you  What I meant by that  I'm saying the way  He was talking  You know then  Somebody calls in  With it  And the way he was talking  I think it was scripted  I did not think  And did not say  That I thought  You guys  Were in on the lie  I was watching your face  On the video  And it looks like  You're there  Believing it  And hearing it  For the first time  So you guys  Aren't even on the radar screen  As far as I'm concerned  With this whole deal  But I know Jesse  Pretty damn well  And see him get tears 
[01:32:00]  In his eyes  And stuff  When he talks to troops  In airports  And stuff  I mean quite frankly  If he sees troops  He runs over  Or they run over to him  And it goes on and on  And it's the same thing  About it's the politicians  That have sent you  And it's wrong  And it's  It's terrible  What's happening to you  And all this stuff  So when I  When I heard him  Talk about punching him  And knocking him down  I thought well  That sounds wild  But could be true  But as soon as he  Said the thing  On O'Reilly  And stuff about  Yeah he said  You deserve to die  You guys deserve to die 
[01:32:30]  When the family's  Right there  That is made up  Period  I knew it was  Bull then  And guaranteed  Ventura  I've never even heard him  After I did that interview  The other day on Skype  He was like  I heard him like  Almost crying  In the background  And his wife  Totally angry  So believe me  Ventura's not getting ready  To depose people  And go absolutely  Ape over nothing  He doesn't have  People over there  At that McP's place  Getting  You know  Getting affidavits  Signed and stuff  For nothing  Totally made up  Alright listen  So you have no doubt 
[01:33:00]  That Chris Kyle  Did not punch  Jesse Ventura  No what I just said is  I was going back  To when I watched  The video  Last week  When he first said  Did Chris Kyle  Punch Jesse Ventura  Or not  Let me just stop you  Right there  Ventura denies  That it ever happened  And do you believe that  Absolutely  But what I'm telling you  Is watching the video  Knowing Ventura  Okay  Knowing him well  I'm watching the video  And the guy's saying  You know  He was talking about  About the war  And punched him  I'm thinking 
[01:33:30]  Well that might have  Happened  When he gets to  The part  About yeah  He said the  Seals deserve to die  And when he said  It on O'Reilly  It looked really  Scripted by him  You know  He was following  A script  I knew it was  Pure bull  And as soon as  I talked to  Ventura  As soon as I  Could get a hold  Of him  Sure enough  He was completely  Dumbfounded  Alex  We gotta jump in  A little bit  Because don't forget  Chris is not a  Public figure  So he's not used  To speaking publicly  So when he's  Talking about  Things that he's  Not used to  Talking about  On Bill O'Reilly  A show he's  Probably watched  For 10 years  Right 
[01:34:00]  It might be a  Little bit more  Nerve wracking  And we do have  Chris here  To respond to that  We have to let  Him respond  Yeah  Chris how do you  How do you feel  Well he'll get to  Respond in court  I mean right now  Chris  Yeah  That's fine  I mean  I've got the people  That are definitely  Going to come out  And some of them  Are the family members  That were there  So I'm not too concerned  And Chris what did he  Say about the Navy  Seals dying  I think that that's  Being misquoted  What did he say  Yeah you are misquoting  It Alex  What did he say Chris  He said you deserve  To lose a few  Deserve to lose a few  Yeah that means  Deserve to die  Well it does 
[01:34:30]  What it means  And what was said  Don't try Perry Mason  Crap  You've been misquoting  The man the whole time  You've ever  Alex  Kyle you think  You're going to make  A big name for your  New American mercenary  Force to help  Knock heads of  American people  Think again  I know all about  Richard Perl  All about your trips  To Israel  All of it buddy boy  Who is Richard Perl  Who is Richard Perl  Who is Richard Perl  Yeah it'll all come out  And by the way Alex 
[01:35:00]  Who is Richard Perl  And we're also not  Giving you Perry Mason  Stuff and playing  Semantics games  The difference  To me it's more  Believable for Jesse  Ventura to say  You guys deserve  To lose a few  Than to say something  As harsh  Right  As I'm glad  Navy Seals are dying  Exactly  There is a difference  In believability  In what one guy  Would say  And I don't think  Jesse Ventura  Would come out  And go I'm glad  A soldier's dead  Look that's the same thing  And that's how  No it's not  That he was  That he's saying  The Navy Seals  Deserve to lose a few  That is saying 
[01:35:30]  Lose a few means die  It absolutely does  But there is a difference  In the way you say it  One is more believable  To me  Listen I hope for you  Your sake  That you are telling the truth  And you know  I mean Ventura  Is so freaked out by this  He's saying  You know do they have  A body double of me  Or something  Let me say  I talked to him  That's paranoia  He is completely  He is completely  Flummoxed  And dumbfounded  I'm flummoxed  And dumbfounded  Chris  Chris were you tempted  To put Jesse's name  In the book  Because Alex  One thing that makes  This more believable 
[01:36:00]  To me  Is that Chris did not  Put the name  Put the name  In the book  The publisher probably  Said he couldn't prove it  The publisher  Now Chris Kyle  Is saying today  Alex that he can  Prove this  And a lot of the guys  That know about this  He finally told them  Yeah you could  Tell everyone  What you saw that day  Okay well that's not  What the owner  Of the bar  Is going to say  Now Chris  Why didn't you  Put it in the book  Honestly  Because I didn't want  This whole reaction  To come out here  Yeah see  I'm not trying to  Sell my book 
[01:36:30]  Off of making  Someone else look bad  And Alex  Is it possible  Because we heard you  Calling Chris  You called it  The turkey shoot  Is it possible  That your agenda  Look you don't like  The war  It's common knowledge  And you love Jesse  Isn't it possible  That your agenda  Is skewing  The way you're  Looking at this  Well yeah  I mean we all  See through  Rose colored glasses  And you know  I'm a Texan  You know  I mean I'm sure  Kyle at some point  Is a friendly guy  My whole issue here 
[01:37:00]  Is when I say  Turkey shoot  Not that I follow  Too much of this  Military stuff  But I love  Families in the military  And of course  There's the big joke  About you know  The Hadjis  Don't know how  To aim a gun  My god  You know  There were people  There who couldn't  Believe the kill  Numbers everybody  Was getting  And when you're  Shooting women  Running around  With hangar nades  And you're shooting  I mean  Plus there's all  The contractor footage  Of them playing  Elvis music  And shooting whole  Families out of  Their cars  And then dropping  AK-47s on them  I mean that's the  Big joke  Every armored vehicle  And Kyle knows this 
[01:37:30]  It's full of  Drop guns  And they splatter  A whole bunch of  People at a  Checkpoint or whatever  Dropping AK-47 on them  You all get  You know  Bronze stars for  Kills in combat  I'm not saying  That's exactly  What Kyle did  But it's all  Well known  About Iraq  Kyle  How do you  The Iranian war  Start  Yeah you were  Over there  You must have  Seen it  Kyle how do you  Respond to that  You gotta let  Kyle respond  You can't make  An accusation like  That not let  Kyle respond  He's gotta  Respond  Kyle  Chris I'm  Sorry  No problem  We've never  Had drop weapons  On us  But I can tell 
[01:38:00]  You as far as  The book  It's not sitting  There trying to  Glorify all the  People I've killed  It's trying to  Get across  The sacrifices  That a military  Member has to  Go through  While he's  Overseas  And at the  Same time  My wife is  Telling the  Sacrifices  She went through  While here at  Home  And I'm  Trying to  Highlight the  Heroes that  Surrounded me  That made me  Look good  And all through  The book  I downplay myself  And one thing  You said Chris  To when you  Were on  Is that  People were  Trying to  Inflate the  Number to  Two something  And Alex  You didn't  Hear the  Interview  But Chris  Kept going  I'm happy  This is fine 
[01:38:30]  I don't need  Any more  Numbers attributed  To me  He was downplaying  Everything that day  And on your show  I think in war  A sniper is an  Honorable position  People always try  To make it look bad  I've interviewed  A lot of snipers  Like Colonel Craig  Roberts and others  We did in Vietnam  And I'm not  Downplaying that  You know that Chris  Can't shoot a  Nat off  A fence post  To a thousand  Yards  I'm simply  Saying that  It's well known  Just like with  The army  Helicopter  Shooting up  The Reuters  Van  That as far 
[01:39:00]  As turkey  Shoot goes  There were times  When you just  Have all sorts  Of mayhem  And people  Being blasted  In all directions  And it's a lot  Easier to be a  Sniper in the  Desert or in  Those built up  Mount areas  Than it was in  Say southeast  Asia  I mean that's  My point about  Turkey Shoot  Clearly Kyle  Would it have  Been harder  To make  Thousand yard  Two thousand  Yard shots  In Vietnam  In the jungle  Or from a  Rooftop into a  Desert  Oh I am not  Claiming my  Wars any harder  Than Vietnam 
[01:39:30]  And I give the  Vietnam vets  All the props  Because they  Definitely fought  A harder war  And I give  Carlos Halfcock  All the credit  As being the  Greatest sniper  To have ever  Lived  And Alex  That's all I was  Saying guys  Okay something  You said too  Which I thought  Was a little  Unfair  You said that  Chris is bragging  About shooting  Women  And the way  You painted  That and we  Played the audio  Was that here  Is this  Here is this  Guy going over  To Iraq  And he's  Coming back  Acting like  He's hot shit  For killing  Women  But when  Chris described  That shoot  He was really  Specific 
[01:40:00]  He was bothered  By it  About being  Bothered  I read quotes  And in  Fairness the  Media does  Take things out  Of context  Where it's  Talking about  No you  You take things  Out of context  Because you  Made it sound  Like he was  Bragging about  Shooting women  But he didn't  Bragging  When if you  Listened to the  Actual interview  And not  Transcripts  You would have  You would have  Heard Chris  Kyle being  Very bothered  By the fact  That he shot  A woman  I had time  To watch  The entire  Interview  All I saw  Was like a  Three minute  Clip on the  Internet  No no we  Understand that  But we're  Saying when  You're quoting  Something and  You're painting  This guy  There's a big  Difference there 
[01:40:30]  You were  Painting him  As this  Cavalier ass  Who was bragging  About shooting  A woman  And what he  Was telling  Us  Chris I  Think is  That you  Made absolutely  Sure she had  A grenade  You could see  It through  Your scope  You were  Being told  Yes you  Have to take  Her out  Because she's  Walking towards  Marines  Like he saved  U.S.  Soldiers lives  But the way  You painted him  All I'm saying  Is this  Even the  Dallas Morning  News said  There's something  Creepy  And I'm not  Even saying  This about  Kyle  About  On TV  Constantly  You know  Especially the 
[01:41:00]  Hosted people  Smacking their  Lips  And maybe  That's where  I'm picking  This up  You guys  Didn't really  Do that  But some  Of the  Other shows  Getting all  Excited  Tell us  More about  Killing the  People  Tell us  More  And it's  Just at  A certain  Point  It's  Disgusting  And I  Don't want  To hear  About it  And I'm  Not saying  Kyle's even  Bad for that  It's true  Now that I've  Seen more of  The interviews  With him  He's not  The one  Getting off  On it  Some of  The hosts  Are  And I  Just know  All the  People I  Know  From Vietnam  World War  II  And places 
[01:41:30]  I remember  One time  I was  At the  Deer  Camp  And I  Was about  Ten years  Old  For all  These old  World War  II vets  There in  Buffalo  Texas  You know  Just south  Of Dallas  Where we've  Got a ranch  And I know  Kyle's from  That general  Area  And I'm  Sitting there  Pulling on  Their leg  At 5 a.m.  While they're  Cooking business  And gray  Before we go  Hunting  Tell me a war  Story  Tell me a war  Story  Tell me a war  Story  And one  Old guy  Who was a  Tank commander  Going into  Germany  He said  Okay  There was this  Woman  Looked like 
[01:42:00]  So we cut  Her in half  Now there's  Your story  Don't ask  Me anymore  I understand  That war  Is ugly  I've got  All that  Stuff  All I know  Is I don't  Believe that  Jesse Ventura  Said you  Deserve to  Lose a few  And unless  He was drunk  And the  Problem is  Jesse hasn't  Had alcohol  In like 15  Years because  Of blood clots  He has to  Take medicine  For blood  Clots  And I know  Kyle's  Thing  Now that I've  Seen him on  O'Reilly  That he wasn't  Drinking  All I know  Is that  The Jesse  Ventura I 
[01:42:30]  Know  Does not  Talk about  The troops  It always  Says  It's a line  You know  He says  The same  Stuff over  And over  Again  That the  Troops are  Heroes  It's not  Their fault  It's the  Politician's  Fault for  Failing  And sending  Them there  And lying  About WMD  And so  When Chris  Says that  I mean  And again  Right now  He sounds  Like a nice  Guy  So I'm  Completely  Blown  Away by  This  Because  Ventura  Sounds  Credible  You know  Kyle  Right now  Sounds calm 
[01:43:00]  And nice  I mean  I don't know  What kind of  Psy-off  This is  Or what  This is  But let me  Just tell you  It's a big deal  Well okay  We do have a problem  Because Chris Kyle  Saying it happened  And Jesse Ventura  Saying it didn't happen  Yeah exactly  And we heard some audio  Of you  And you said  That you don't  Even believe  Jesse Ventura  Was in the bar  That day  Because he  Doesn't drink  Well yeah  That was probably  Like last Thursday  Or Friday  Before I talked  To Jesse  And then Jesse  Says yes  I was there  For graduation  But I wasn't 
[01:43:30]  There speaking  It was something  About numbers  That are the same  As another class  Yeah we heard  That part  So you think  Chris Kyle  Is lying  I don't believe  That Jesse Ventura  Said you deserve  To lose  A few  No no no  Alright fair enough  But do you think  Chris Kyle  Punched Jesse Ventura  And knocked him down  I told you  That when I first  Was sitting there  You know they come  In during a break  When I was on the radio  Like last Thursday  And they said  Have you seen this 
[01:44:00]  You know  From the LB and Anthony show  And I said no  Scene one  They said here it is  They pulled it up on screen  And I started watching it  And he says  You know he was in there  Talking about  About the war  Blah blah blah  And I thought  Oh well maybe  There was a fight  And then when he gets  To the part about  You know you deserve  To lose a few  I was like that's  A bunch of bull  And so that  That was my initial  Response  Is that  Is that I can imagine  Jesse Ventura  You know  Sometime making  Somebody angry  Talking bad about 
[01:44:30]  The war  And some type of  Altercation ensuing  But the part  About him saying that  I cannot see that  Happening  And now that  Jesse denied it  I have to believe  Jesse  And let me tell you  Jesse's so shocked  That other Navy SEAL  Would say something  Like this  Because he thinks  They're all honorable  That you know  Off air  He even said  Some of it on air  He's like  My god Alex  Do you think  Like they had  A double in there  And this is  Some type of  Psy-off  Now Chris  Now Chris  Is it possible  That you and Jesse 
[01:45:00]  Were arguing  Or you were debating  And he said something  To the effect of  It's only natural  You're going to lose a few  Or are you 100% sure  That he said it  And with the intention  That you heard it  No  I feel the opinion  That he said  Exactly what I thought  He heard  Some other guys  That were standing  Right there  Oh they heard it as well  And I feel horrible  About it coming out  The way it had  And I'm sorry  I handled it  The way I did  On your show  I guess I should have  Just denied it  And said I don't know 
[01:45:30]  What you're talking about  And I had no idea  And after all this  Has come out  I've listened to  Different interviews  Of people  Trying to you know  Say I'm lying  And everything  I had no idea  And Mr. Ventura  Was trying to  Was thinking about  Public office  Doing all this other stuff  I honestly have no idea  Who this Pearl guy is  So no  I'm not part of  Some bigger thing  Trying to discredit him  And yeah  I feel bad  That now all of a sudden  All this attention  Is on this  And I'm trying to  Get a story out there  About hey  Y'all look at what  The troops have to 
[01:46:00]  Go through  Take notice  And let's take care  Of these  Can I ask you a question  Definitely  You're setting up  Craft  And you say  You're going to have  Basically diplomatic  Protection  Training of law  Enforcement  All these groups  You've gotten  Awards from different  International groups  I know you'd be here  Or I'd pull it up  And I mean  Have you gone to  Israel and gotten  Police training  No sir  So  So you haven't  Gotten awards  From that 
[01:46:30]  American  Slash  Israel group  That trains  Domestic  U.S.  Police  Well I got  A Jensa  Award  Jewish Institute  For National  Security Affairs  That's while I was  Still active  That was  In  05  Yeah well just so you know  That's Richard Pearl  And he's known as  The Prince of Darkness  In the Pentagon  That's his nickname  But let's just expand  On that for a moment  Do you know about  The National Defense  Authorization Act  And how Congress  Just abolished  The Posse Comitatus Act  I mean you're a 
[01:47:00]  You're a  What  Master Sergeant  Isn't it  No sir  I was a chief  Chief okay  Chief  A chief sergeant  I forget all these  Different titles and names  I mean certainly  You know what  Posse Comitatus is  What  Sir honestly  As far as when it  Comes to that  I have my business  Partners  Because my  My main concern  Is running the  Training side  Of the business  I understand  What is  Posse Comitatus  I don't know  What it is  I'm pretty sure  I've caught it twice  It means no worries  For the rest of your days 
[01:47:30]  Why don't you shut up  Norton  And play the player  I don't know  I don't know  What Posse Comitatus means  Oh okay  That's the 1878 law  Barring the military  From domestic law enforcement  Oh okay  And and and Kyle  I mean I'm just curious here  I mean this  This sniper training  And stuff  I mean  That's basically  Paramilitary training  For the police  But I know  They've had snipers  Before that  I'm just saying  I see a lot  Of data points here  And I was thinking  Maybe somebody  Had  Maybe you had  Been in an altercation 
[01:48:00]  With some big guy  Looked like Ventura  Maybe somebody  Told you that was Ventura  Maybe somebody  Put you up  To talking about this  But you know  Listening to you now  You sounded  You sound dumbfounded  So I  I'm dumbfounded  You know  I think that  Leave the  Founded part off  Yeah  Yeah  Is it  Alex  I mean is Jesse  Really that important  In the end  That we have to  Take that  Take out Jesse Ventura  And discredit him  Okay well here's  Why Jesse's  That's a question  I don't know  Okay here's something  I know isn't true  100% 
[01:48:30]  Because I probably  Talk to Jesse  Every few weeks  Or something  Or he gives me a call  To ask me about news  Sorry about that  Just get ambient  But my point is  I talked like  Two weeks ago  I called Jesse  And I said  When are you leaving  The US  Are you going to be  Driving through Texas  You know  You are in your RV  Stop by my house  And he's like  Well I think I'm leaving  In about a week or so  And he said  But let me call you  In the next few days  And I'll come on the radio  Before I leave town  I said great  Say hi to your wife  Bye  Next day  Phone rings  While I'm on air  Jesse Ventura 
[01:49:00]  Has got some breaking news  He wants to come on  Now I've just called him  In Minnesota  Talked to him  What happened  You know his wife  Got him off the elliptical machine  I know he's in Minnesota  And it's all over TMZ  Fox News  That Jesse Ventura  Is rubbernecking  Recklessly driving  In California  Trying to get to the airport  Well Jesse  Has it flown in 16 months  Anyway  So Jesse's saying  This is crazy  I think this is some  Dirty trick  Saying I'm you know  Tailgating  Being pulled over by police  I'm here in Minnesota  So he had to threaten  TMZ to retract it 
[01:49:30]  So first you have  That false story come out  Fox runs with it  And then  And then this other story  Comes out  And I'm telling you  If Jesse is lying  He is  He is a better liar  Than even Herman Cain  If he's lying  He's one of the best  Liars I've  Ever seen  So that's  That means you're saying  Chris Kyle's lying  Chris there's no doubt  In your mind  That you punched  Jesse Ventura that day  Right  Yes sir  Definitely  And Mr. West  You're a friend  Of Mr. Ventura's  I'd be more than happy  If you would like to  Set up a time  For me and him  Not on the air 
[01:50:00]  Me and him  To be able to talk  Whether on the phone  Or in person  I'll be in California  Next or this week  And Vegas  The week after  I'll be more than happy  To sit down  Me and him talk  And settle this thing  Wow that would be  A newsworthy event  Well why even make it  On the news  I mean  I'm trying to  Yeah Alex  What's wrong with you  On this  He wants this thing  To go away  I fully  100% believe  I'm telling the truth  You believe him  I think him and I 
[01:50:30]  Could definitely  Clear the air on this  Sure  Well  Well then I'll tell you  What I'll do  If you can get me  Your number  Or your email  I'll give it to Jesse  And I know he's got  Whoa  How about we do it  On our show  Well no  I mean  I'm not even  Whoa  What happened here  He doesn't want  To do it on any show  How about we do  A joint venture  Mr. Alex Jones  If you want to get  Them both on together  That's fine  We bring you  We bring you  Chris Kyle  You bring us Jesse  Let's do this  That's fair 
[01:51:00]  In a cage  What  I'm just trying  To keep it  From the public eye  Right  Chris doesn't want  Chris doesn't want  A three ring circus  Hold on Alex  Chris do you have  Do you have audio Skype  Because the only thing  That works  From where he's at  The bar  Is audio Skype  To Skype  There's no phone lines  Nothing  So I can  I mean  Look I'll just  I'll just send Jesse  An email  And then I'll see  If I can give you  His Skype ID  I just need some way  To give that  To Mr. Kyle  I do not have Skype 
[01:51:30]  We'll get it done  Off air  You don't want to  Give it on the air  We'll do it off air  That's easy  We'll just  Chris just stay on hold  When we finish  And talk to our guy  One more question  For Alex Jones  I don't see the upside  Of Chris Kyle  Telling this story  Considering his  Career in the military  And considering  His new business there  Why would he  Take this chance  And put this crazy  Lie out there  Look all I know  Is this  His book was already  Getting quite a bit  Of attention 
[01:52:00]  But I mean  He got like  Three or four times  The attention  And of course  It did kind of  Distract in a way  But he did get  A ton of attention  Out of this  Yeah it sold  A lot of books  We know that  But in the end  You know  Okay you sell  A lot of books  But you destroy  Your military career  Well I know this  That is what's happening  Because I've looked  At the different  Seal websites  And stuff  They're all mad  And saying  Even if this is true  And they're all  Saying they didn't  Hear of it happening  And they think  They would have  That this makes  It look like  Seals are all  Talking crap  About each other  And it just  Makes the seals 
[01:52:30]  I mean even  If you believe  Ventura said that  It makes it horrible  That he'd say  He'd lose some  And it makes it  Horrible that  Chris Kyle  Would talk about it  But I can tell  By the way you're  Talking  Chris is not  The way you thought  Like you originally  Might have  Interpreted him  And I think  That you're seeing  He's a lot more  Of a real  And believable guy  Yeah I mean  In the clips  I've seen  Especially on your show  I mean he came off  As kind of scripted  On O'Reilly  And I see what  You're saying  As he probably  Was nervous  And so was just  Thinking about  What he was going to say  And because 
[01:53:00]  I mean I'm in the media  So much  So are you guys  You almost forget  You're even on air  It's like  The opposite problem  You forget you're on air  I mean I wish  I got butterflies  Like I did 16 years ago  And then at the same time  When I saw him  On your show  He just seemed  Kind of like  Smirky  And arrogant  And you know  Like it was real funny  And now he doesn't  Sound like that  So I mean  It does sound different  Alex  Alex could you  Could you meet Chris  Maybe a thousand yards  South of the  Stratosphere Hotel  In Vegas  Yeah 
[01:53:30]  He'll send you a message  Hey by the way  I'm from Texas too  And I've shot a deer  At a thousand yards  I haven't shot an Iraqi  At 2,600  Yeah  Did a deer have a grenade  I doubt it  I could see a deer  At a thousand yards  All day long  You're all man  Alex  Well I'm not a Bronco rider  I mean I didn't do it  Professionally like Kyle  But I have  I did work for a large  Animal vet  For a couple years  And I've  So I've run  The electric D horners  And the hot shots  And I've inoculated  A thousand cows 
[01:54:00]  In one day  Alright I think we're good  But we appreciate you guys  We appreciate you both  Coming on  And Chris we'll talk  To you off air  For a second  Yeah we're in a quandary  Sir  I believe Chris  I believe Chris  I think that  Yeah look  They had a good discussion  And Chris explained himself  Alright fair enough  And Alex  Officially you believe  Jesse  Folks should go to  Infowars.com  Or ChrisPlan.com  And watch the full interview  At Infowars.com  And see who you believe  Yes I believe Jesse 
[01:54:30]  But here's the deal Chris  I guess I can contact  Your publisher  And try to get your contact  So I can put you in touch  With Jesse  Definitely  Okay well then  I'll just  Tell your publisher  To  Who should I contact  With the publisher  William Morrow  No no but they're going  To be getting so many calls  Just just  Wait do we do it off air  Because you're going to have  A bunch of names  Flying around  Yeah  We'll get it to you off air  The real name from Chris  Yeah  I think it might be  Ted Sheckler  Yeah  Well whatever we do  Yeah it's Ted Sheckler 
[01:55:00]  Because I don't  I mean this is  Definitely turning into  A mess  Alright we'll get it  Figured out  Yeah we do it all  Together though  We do it all together  Nice  Alex thank you for  Coming on  You bet thank you  Take care buddy  Alright Alex  Chris  Enjoy the boneyard  Alright  Yes I appreciate that  And Chris  If you're not going to be  In Phoenix January 27th and 28th  When I'm working in Tempe  I meant to say Tempe  At the improv  Talk to our guy  Off the air  And give him your info  And if he's not going to be  In Cleveland  Because I'll be at the improv  That weekend  Then he can come  To that show  Love the plugs 
[01:55:30]  Chris you  Wow you created  A lot of talk there sir  Yes man  Thank you for coming on today  Yeah  Thanks for having me guys  I don't see why you would  Lie about this one  I don't either  No doubt  Yeah so  When are these guys  Coming forward you think  The witnesses  They're starting to now  They're already talking  To other people  Getting it all set up  And they're  Getting them all together  Can we help in that way  Or how are you guys  Going to do it  Because you've got to  Get it to the media  Somehow 
[01:56:00]  That's what we're  Trying to figure out  The best way to do this  That way  I'm trying to avoid  A three ring circus  I'm trying  Not to  De-fame  Mr. Ventura  And you know  I'm kind of trying  To knock the legs  Out from him  I'm just trying to  Get all the guys  Together  I gave them  The contact person  Of who they need  To get a hold of  And give them  Their story  And then  Trying to figure out  The best way  To come out with this  So it doesn't look like  You know 
[01:56:30]  This thing continues on  And we're just here  To bash him  We just want this thing  To end and go away  Alright there you go  Thank you Chris  We appreciate you  Calling in today  Take care buddy  We'll talk to you  Off air  Thanks man  Alright Chris Kyle  I'm putting you on hold  Hold on  Wow  That's good  That's cool  I think Alex  Hearing him talk  Knows that this guy  Is not a bullshitter  Yeah exactly  He ain't gonna throw  His friend under the bus  But you can listen  Chris Kyle  Yeah he's in one  Of those positions  Where he can't  Throw his friend under the bus  That was his  You hear that Alex  Yes I'm sitting here 
[01:57:00]  You heard that right  You now believe  Chris Kyle  After you heard him  On our show  I think you know  He's more believable  No I think  Listen  Where'd he go  Oh no  In the first interview  He seems concerned  Hello  Situation  I just think  This whole thing  Hello  Yeah  Am I even on air  Because I hear the phone 
[01:57:30]  Going on and off here  Are you guys  Are you clicking off  Because I'm hearing  Half what you're saying  Yeah get a better phone  It's not our problem  No I'm sitting right here  It's PSYOPs  So I'm sitting right here  PSYOPs is going on  They don't want  They don't want  What you have to say  On the air  For some reason  No I don't think  That's what's happening  When I sit  I don't think  That's what's happening  He gives us a proper response  Yeah  No I don't think  That's what's happening  I don't think  Au contraire  Infowars.com  Infowars.com  Alright Alex  Enjoy your day  Alright Alex  I believe Jesse Ventura 
[01:58:00]  And it's all gonna come out  Alright  We'll see  By the way  Ron Paul brother  Hey I love Ron Paul  And that's the one thing  We have in common sir  Ron Paul  Yeah I support Ron Paul too  But that's where it ends  Yeah  Now go do something  We got a radio show  Go be on the radio  Listen did I tell you guys  About the website  Infowars.com  You have not answered that  Did I tell you  I'm gonna be at the improv  Yes  You plug the improv  For me and Florentine  And I'll plug your website  On the boneyard  Can I get you guys  On my radio show  To talk about all this  No  I would do it  We got our own show 
[01:58:30]  Why would I do your show  We got our show  But in case you haven't noticed  You know I have the  Number one alternative news website  We only get  Two million visitors a day  Oh  Infowars.com  Is big pal  Alex I gotta be honest  Why didn't you put our video  Up there on Infowars  Over 100 AM and FM  I mean I'm a pretty big radio host  But why didn't you put  Our video on Infowars.com  You only put the O'Reilly one on  I think  Because I personally  Wasn't trying to make  A big deal out of this  And then I saw the O'Reilly thing  And I'm like  Crap I better get a hold of Ventura 
[01:59:00]  And then once I got a hold of him  You know  I mean if he's lying  He's an Academy Award  You know actor  Alex can we break this down  We're a bunch of radio guys  Jesse's a little  A little kooky right  Say that again  He's a little kooky  Who Ventura  Come on  Let's be honest with each other  We're just hanging out in a bar  A bunch of radio guys  No mics  He's a little kooky right  No Ventura is 100% real  And doesn't care  Except for his 20 years of wrestling  I've spent a lot of time with Jesse 
[01:59:30]  In the last 6 years or so  I've known him for about 7 years  And I'm telling you  He is  He is the real deal  And he's been waking up  To a lot of issues  And he's a really nice guy  And his wife's really nice  And I always see him go up  And thank veterans and people  And I don't believe  He said that about  The Navy SEALs  But is he a little paranoid  A little paranoid  In the Jesse Ventura  Well I mean I think  If he was paranoid  He'd be afraid to go out  And do his TV show and stuff 
[02:00:00]  But I would say  I'll tell you when Ventura  Really woke up  He'd seen my films  We'd talked and stuff  But then he went to Harvard  With that fellowship  And had a private dinner  With McNamara  After he saw McNamara  Give a speech there  The former Secretary of Defense  Admitting the government stage  The Gulf of Tonkin  Attack on our ships  To get us into Vietnam  And Ventura totally  Had argued with me and others  And said there's no way  The government stages stuff  And his whole world  Came crashing down 
[02:00:30]  At that point  And he became  Very untrusting  And has now read  I mean my god  He probably reads  Two or three books  A week just on politics  And is obsessed with it now  Do you think  I'll accidentally interrupt  Do you think that makes  That makes sense  What you're saying  Like because  When you have something  Shattered for you  Isn't it possible  That he has this image  Shattered  So he goes so far  In the other direction  Yeah now everything  Is a conspiracy  Yeah and almost  Looks at things  That did happen  A certain way  As a conspiracy  Well that is a danger 
[02:01:00]  For anybody  That wakes up  And says well  My parents told me  Santa Claus was real  But now I found out  He's not  Well relax on that  Yeah what do you mean  He's not  Yeah  I know I've sat  On his lap  And turned off my bottom  Alex we'll promote  Infowars.com  As long as you put  Our video up there  Okay listen guys  I'm just joking around  About the Infowars.com  That's fine  It's a big site  Seriously  We understand  We understand promoting  Our shit  We're all in agreement  There  Well I tell you what 
[02:01:30]  I'll plug your website  Today and tell them  That this interview  Is posted up there  Okay buddy  Fair enough Alex  But I mean seriously  Listen  I'm telling you  Ventura is anguished  By this  And completely  Flummoxed  And again  He would not say  The thing about  You deserve to lose  A few men  I mean that is  That is crazy  And he also made the point  If he would have said  Something like that  He would have been attacked  And thrown out of the bar  I mean that  No I guess 
[02:02:00]  I guess we're hearing it  Happen on the sidewalk  But there were witnesses  And Chris Kyle's  Getting those witnesses  Together  That's what we learned today  Because he's finally had it  Because his name's at stake  So he's like  Well I got some  Guys that are willing  To come forward now  Yeah so we'll see  What they have to say  His buddies better  Make damn sure  Because let me tell you  Something  If Jesse Ventura  Is anything  He's somebody  Who will go after you  With lawyers  Vince McMahon  TSA  I mean and believe me  He is lawyering up  So I just  I just  I mean listen  Believe me  He wouldn't be 
[02:02:30]  Flipping out  Getting ready for  All of his depositions  You name it  I mean let me tell you  This is a quandary  Because Kyle  Didn't come off  Very credible  I thought in the interview  The other day  Didn't come off  Credible on O'Reilly  He does sound  Like he's paying  Attention now  And you know what  This is a circus  This is ridiculous  There's about to start  A war with Iran  The economy  Is imploding  They clearly stole  Iowa from Ron Paul  That even came out  In mainstream news  New Hampshire  Is today  All of this stuff  Is going on 
[02:03:00]  And we're talking about  Jesse Ventura  And Chris Kyle  Who are supposed  To be in a fraternity  A band of brothers  And the whole thing  Is disgusting  And nasty  And I'm just glad  That you guys  Had me on here  To discuss it  I will say this  Thanks Alan  Ron Paul is going to  Get killed up  In New Hampshire  I mean that's  Mitt Romney country  But I do think  That Romney stinks  Of course I mean  Metaphorically  In an election  No no not  Mitt Romney stinks  And I think  Rick Santorum  Is a twat  So go Ron Paul  That we agree on  Alright man 
[02:03:30]  Take care  Go Boneyard  Go Boneyard  And Ron Paul  I hear a little bit  More vintage Motorhead  You've been playing  Too much of the new stuff  Alright I'll play  Something for tonight's show  What is your favorite  Motorhead song  If we had to ask Alex  Well it's going to be  That's the one thing  I really wanted to hear  I want to know  How deep he goes  Anyone didn't see  That coming  I know I saw it coming  But I really want  If he would have said  Like the chase is better  Than the catch  I'm like this fucking  Guy knows his shit  Now he rocks  Talking to him  It's hard not to enjoy  Alex 
[02:04:00]  I like him from  An entertainment standpoint  He's good  I don't agree with  You know  A lot of the stuff  He says  Yeah  I get so angry  When people  I think people  Are bad mouthing  I just react so angrily  You know what  God bless Alex Jones  Getting right in there  And you know  Fighting  And Chris Kyle  That was good  All that shit was good  He knows what's good  Florentine's here  He's got a one man show  It's called  Jim's One Man Show  I'm Your Savior  At the brokerage  In Long Island  I say on Long Island  Myself  BrokerageComedy.com  It's tomorrow night

[02:05:00]  Huh  A quandary  Chris Kyle says  He punched  Jesse Ventura  And knocked him down  Yeah  For some shit Jesse was saying  That day  Jesse told Alex Jones  That it didn't happen  Right  That is called a quandary  Is that a quandary  It is right  Or a conundrum  I don't know  Is it a quandary  I don't know  Hmm  Well that's definitely 
[02:05:30]  Something you have to say  It didn't happen  If you're Jesse  Yeah  You can't just go  Yeah he did  And I did say that  And I'm sorry  Good point  Yeah that's true  Yep  Hmm  Who's lying  It's not the end of this one  Jim Florentine in studio  You'll hear it  Playing the brokerage  Out there on Long Island  Tomorrow night  The big one man show  I'm your savior  8 o'clock show  It's close to me  I should go to that one  Right  Go and go  8 o'clock  It's close to me 
[02:06:00]  It's early  8 o'clock  Yeah it's over  It's like an hour  And ten minutes  Over at 910  You get to see  The wrestling pictures  I know  I want to see that  You got to  Stan the Man Stasiak  And Freddie Blassie bleeding  Oh please  I love Freddie Blassie  Your asshole bleeding  Whatever  Superstar Billy Graham  Yeah  Sounds fun man  Yeah  I got a picture  Of the actual guy  That molested me  He was on a sex offender's website  So I have that picture too  Oh really  Yeah  Can we see it here today 
[02:06:30]  Does he look like  The typical child toucher  He kind of does  Yeah  Kid toucher  Yeah  Yeah you know what  I could probably do it  Yeah let me  I'll write  I'll write his name down  Oh nice  Some  Because you know  When I told the story  On the air here  About 30 people emailed me  And said this guy  Did this to me too  Wow  So and then we found out  The guy's like  I think it was this guy's name  And then he showed me the picture  I'm like yep that's him  So he was like  A Sandusky type character  Yeah  You're a southpaw  Yeah  I didn't know that 
[02:07:00]  Lefty  All these years  Jim Florentine's a lefty  Of course  I only whacked my bag  With my right hand  Really  Yeah I can't do it with the left  Doesn't make sense  Everything else  You get a short-termer  With the left  Yeah I can do  A couple of  A couple of jiggles  But to get a good rhythm  Yeah I mean I'll cut my balls  With the left  Yeah  You know that's how I use it  For that  It could get in  Yeah  Get in on the action  I need an extra touch  I gotta ask Florentine quickly  Cause he knows way more  Than we do 
[02:07:30]  Football  What do you think of  Tim Tebow's performance  And where are we at  With the playoffs  Well  Look he's  He's fun to watch  He's fun to watch  But everybody's judging this guy  The guy's only played  15 games so far  I think in his career  Like 3 last year  Maybe 12 this year  Whatever  And they're already going  This guy's not gonna make  You don't know  You know  Any guy that's not even  Played a full  Peyton Manning was  Was horrible his first year  The team went 3-13  He threw like 25 interceptions  About 12 touchdowns  So if you looked at his 
[02:08:00]  You're like  This guy's not gonna be good  Cam Newton looked amazing  This year  He's probably gonna take  A big step back next year  So you know  Who knows  But everybody's like  No no  This guy's not gonna do it  Meanwhile he's throwing  50 yard bombs  And they're perfect passes  So  But he's already done it  This year  Even if they're knocked out  By the Patriots this weekend  It's a hell of a year  For the Broncos  Absolutely  I mean you know  That's a great year  For your football team  It is great  Absolutely  I mean you look  They were 8-8  They were in a shitty division  True  But still  They fell apart at the end  They lost 3 in a row  The Jets the last 2 years  You know  I mean 2 years ago 
[02:08:30]  When they got in  When the Colts laid down  And stuff  And they went all the way  To the championship game  It doesn't matter  As long as you get in  You do whatever the hell  You think Sanchez  Is a franchise quarterback  No but  Why not  Because he does have the skills  But as a Jets fan  He just frustrates  The hell out of me  He's  Look  He got you to 2 championship games  You gotta look at it that way  How many teams have done that  Before  The guys  Look  He definitely took a step back  This year  I think it's more  Your play call  And your offensive coordinator  A lot of people  Are pointing the finger at me  Yeah  You need different plays 
[02:09:00]  And it's too predictable  Yeah  And you need speedy receivers  Those guys  You know  Flexible Burris  Has no speed anymore  It's tough with a gunshot wound  To the leg  You need some fast guys on there  That's what the league's about  Which is  You know  It's almost like  The arena football league now  With the Packers  And the Saints  And you know  In domes  And all that shit  And you can't touch anybody  It's a fucking joke  Football's becoming that  You think?  Yeah absolutely  Look at that Saints game  It's like  Come on already  It's a joke  As soon as these dome teams 
[02:09:30]  Go outside  I can't wait for the Saints  To play in Green Bay  For a championship game  If the Giants don't beat them  And watch when it's 10 degrees out  And fucking  With a little wind  We'll see how fucking good  Drew Brees is  I just came out  Are you tired of Drew Brees?  Well no  It's just the whole fucking  You know  All offense  Every play is a 15 yard  You know  Fucking roughing the passer  You know  You hit a guy in a helmet  Accidentally  You're trying to tackle a guy  Sorry  You're coming at him  100 miles an hour  You might hit his helmet  Had that happen on trains  We've talked about it on the show though 
[02:10:00]  Football's in trouble  Because these guys are getting  Way too strong  For the sport itself  So they've got to make  All these rules  And a lot of fans  And the players  Don't like the new rules  To try to protect the guys  All these guys are on HGH  And probably some kind of  L-osteroid or testosterone  So that's why they're so huge  And these guys are getting  Killed out there  Right  And they're never going to get it out  The HGH is out of your system  In like  In like three days  So unless you're tested  Within that three day period  You're never going to get caught  So  Really?  Yeah  And there's this testosterone  Now that all the baseball players 
[02:10:30]  Take that's out of your system  Could be out of your system  Within a day  That's what happened  With that Ryan Braun guy  That got to win the MVP  He wound up freaking  Take it in the playoffs  Figured he was going to be safe  And then they tested him  And he tested  Went through the roof  It was the biggest  Highest testosterone levels ever  They found on the guy  But he probably just took it  And figured  Alright we're done  They're not going to come  And test me  What do you do  What does it do for you  The testosterone  Do you have to work out  After you take it  You don't have to work out  It just gives you more energy  It gets you  You know  A pump  And you know 
[02:11:00]  Just fucking  Can we take that shit  Yeah you can take it  Will it help our radio careers  Huh  Will it help our radio careers  You think  That'll give you more energy  Yeah  Yeah  Can I get some muscles  You'll get some muscles  You'll get a nice cut  Muscles  And what about  The other side of that  The health thing  No come on  I mean  It's all good  Yeah  As long as you cycle in and out  Take a fucking Percocet  Or a fucking pills  The rest of your life  Let it go through your liver  That's okay  But just don't  No one's ever died of steroids ever  Lyle Alzado did  And he had brain cancer  Sir I've never had a perk 
[02:11:30]  No one's  There's no side effects  To steroids  I've never taken a perk  Where did he get that brain cancer  I didn't know that  Because you get big  And you want to fucking fight people  Because now you're big  Everyone I picked on  You go  Yeah now I want to kick your ass  Oh so they call that red rage  But now you're just big  So fuck it  Let me kick some ass  So Jose Canseco  Was kind of being truthful  Didn't he talk about  In a positive way  Yeah look at Schwarzenegger  He's still alive  How come he didn't drop dead  He's been taking steroids  For 30 years  And how old is he now  Supposedly  He's like 63  Is it bad for your liver  Stallone  No  I didn't know that  You don't think so  Let me start taking steroids  I'm going to get bigger 
[02:12:00]  Everyone's the old  New Jim Morton  But every once in a while  We lose one  What's that about then  Who  Who do we lose  Well how about the wrestlers  How about Lyle  The wrestlers are all  39, 40 years old  Well they're all addicted to pills  Because there's no health insurance  They got nothing  They blow through their money  And then they  You know  Vince McMahon throws them  To the side  Or whatever league they're in  And then they just  Get addicted to pills  They got back pain  Knee pain  Everything else  And then they eventually  OD and they're alcoholics  Do you think they should  Allow steroids in baseball  And football  Yes  I kind of agree  Yeah I agree too 
[02:12:30]  Get guys back on the field  As soon as possible  HGH is known to  Heal you quicker  Why not  You got a superstar  On the sideline  That people want to go see  And then he's got a  He can't put this shit  In his body  You could take a painkiller  You know  No problem  Get shot up with that  How's that not a steroid  So you don't feel anything  I get back on the field  I'll tell you something  Those were the glory  Fucking years  Of watching baseball  Oh god  We all were watching  McGuire and shit  So they were just  Fucking jacking those balls  Out of the park  I know  Into parking lots  Those fucking things  Are flying  Bonds  It was great 
[02:13:00]  Oh it was fantastic  Yeah I don't give a fuck  If I'm going to spend  So much money  Going to these games  I want to see monsters  And look at the Mets  They draw like 12,000 people  They got guys on the team  That weigh 160 pounds  Can't even hit a ball  Out of the infield  Nobody fucking wants to see that  Do you understand my teams  Are the Mets  The Islanders  And the Jets  And sort of the Knicks  And sort of the Knicks  I'm starting to pay attention  A little bit  Because now they've  You know  They finally made some moves  Well that's the key  You can't let your son  You know  Let your son pick his teams  I'm going to  Don't do that to him 
[02:13:30]  Don't torture him  Well I got the  I got the Philly connection  So I'm going to  I'm going to give my son  The Phillies  Yeah  I'll allow him to have the Phillies  He can't have the Flyers  Holy fuck  No  Please no  Unless the Islanders move  Then it don't matter  Then whatever  You think he'll end up  A Philly fan?  I'm losing to the Phillies already  Oh yeah  And I know  You're kind of outnumbered  When you  My chick is from Philly too  And she's trying to  You know  The Phillies  Eagles  I know this game  Because I did it to my  Brother-in-law  My brother-in-law  Is a major  New York Rangers family 
[02:14:00]  Major  And we're a major  New York Islanders family  I got in there early  Because I fucking got  A lot of money  And I had season tickets  And I started dragging  The kid to games  When he was two  Three years old  Guess what  He's a big time  Islanders fan  Nice  I stole him  You stole  Because my sister didn't care  It was all about  You know  The men in the family  They were all Rangers fans  So now he shows up  At family functions  With his Islander jersey  And he won't budge  Nice  He's  Well now he's 12 I guess  They beat the shit out of him  Like when are you joining us  And he's like  I'm not 
[02:14:30]  I'm an Islanders fan  And it drives my brother-in-law  Nuts  They're hardcore  But the same thing's  Happening to me  They already got in there  With the Philly shit  See my family always rooted  For like the guy  Who was there  Had the biggest cock  That was how like  My whole family would root  Like they would all  Just sit around  And they would just talk  Like they would zoom in  And talk about  Who had the better balls  And the better buns  So your dad saw  A Starbucks package  And that made you  A fucking cowboy fan  No he's a Giants fan  My father  Oh he is  Yeah  I hate the Giants  Then how did you become  A cowboy fan then 
[02:15:00]  The only thing I can come up with  Is when  Superbowl 13  When they lost to Pittsburgh  That year  My whole family hated  The Cowboys  And loved Pittsburgh  Or loved the Giants  I think I just  Did the opposite  Wow what a rebel  Yeah I know  I was young though  They threw a little Jimmy  In his room  Because he was sucking dicks  Under a dick  So he goes  I'll get back  You know I'm going to be  A cowboy fan  I wear a star on my helmet  And a load in my face  I like that question though  Because it happens  To a lot of people  It would be a good phone topic  Not today  Whatever  My dad once 
[02:15:30]  Took a business trip  To Minnesota  Came back  With some Minnesota  Twin thing  Like a  What is it  A pendant  Or a pendant  Yeah like a little flag  And I almost became  A twins fan  Just because of that  Because I was young  And impressionable  Impressionable  Dad brings you home  Something like that  And so I started  With kind of  Paying attention  To the twins  A little more  And if he had  Another business trip  There and came back  With maybe a t-shirt  Or something  I would have  Probably turned into  A twins fan  Well that's how  I became a Miami Dolphin fan  So you know  But yeah my uncle  Was living down in Florida  When in their heyday  When they were winning 
[02:16:00]  Super Bowls  He just sent me  All these stickers  And pictures  And shit like that  And I'm like  Oh this is cool  This is my team  Yeah there's a fish  With a helmet  Now I'm fucking stuck  With them  When you're a kid  A lot of times  When you're a kid  You like the uniform  I mean  Unless somebody  Is rooting hardcore  For them  What else will draw you  Like hey I like  There's something  Connects you to it  Yeah true  Fucking Dolphins  Took out my jets  Dolphins turned it around  A little bit  At the end of the season  Yeah they always do  Yeah because nobody  Took them serious  So then they  Where are we at  With football  I became a Dolphin fan  Back in the early 70s  There was only two 
[02:16:30]  Black guys on the team  That's why  Who'd you have back then  Like Curtis Johnson  And Mercury Morris  Mercury Morris  Yeah  Do you like Larry Zonka  I love him  Would you like to meet him  I did meet him one time  I loved that bad mustache  And he just fucking  Plowed over people  He's a blue collar  Football player  Yeah  You like Marino  I fucking love the guy  You can't  You can't  I don't know  You know like  I'm in the same category  Were you with Ozzy  If Marino wanted your chick  To give him a handjob  Would you let her  Florentine would give him 
[02:17:00]  A handjob  Yeah I probably  The guys that love Marino  Would allow  You know  They would blow him  If they could  I don't know if I'd blow him  It wouldn't be gay  I don't think Jim would blow him  My friend Kevin  Would you blow Marino  No  No  For the story  No  What if officially  We say it's not gay  Somehow  Somehow the stars align  And we can tell you  Look it won't be gay  If you blow Marino  How about if you  Pulled a train with him  And when he came  You knew someone  Was going to get on your foot  Would you be okay with that  If what  If you were pulling a train 
[02:17:30]  With him and you knew  When he came  Someone was going to get  On your foot  Yeah  Would you take some  Of his semen  On your toes  Yeah I probably  Yeah  If he arced one  On my big toe  Yes  I'd be like look  It happens  You're in a fucking war zone here  It's like when you go  It's like when you go  In a peep booth  There's going to be  Fucking loads all over the place  Don't  I just tell him friends  Don't look down  Don't look down  When you're in a peep booth  Just fucking look straight ahead  You're all business  So you would take some  Marino jizz on your toes  Because you're in a war zone  Fair enough  That's fair  That's not  You know  I'd let Staubach bubble  Come over my knuckles slowly 
[02:18:00]  While he talked about  His auto dealership  It's funny  My friend Kevin  Jim knows him  He's a big Aussie fan too  When I was doing this  Whole scenario  I go  Look if Aussie  You were giving Aussie  A ride home one time  And he goes  Hey can you give me a hand job  I go  Would you do it  He goes  He goes no  I go  Come on  He goes no  You know what I would do  I'd feel sad  I'd just feel sad  That my idol asked me for that  Yeah  So who's going to win it this year  Would you 
[02:18:30]  All right  Would you give Rex Ryan  A hand job  If the Jets won the Super Bowl  Next year  Back to back Super Bowls  Back to back  Yeah  Back to back  Got it  For two Super Bowls  Do you look him in the eye  When you do it  Or do you just look  The other way  Yeah  Can I have that  Distant stare at least  Well you do what  You got to do  All right sure  Why not  Really  Yeah why not  All right  That's two Super Bowls  I got to take it  For Jet Nation  Now what would your wife  Think it at  Would she understand  She would have to 
[02:19:00]  I guess  She knows how much  I like the Jets  No glove either  Oh  Yeah  Because that's a big thing  Wow  And after he comes  On your knuckles  You got to look at it  And smell it  Fucking  I'm playing with perverts  I'm playing with perverts  Yeah you are  Because it's going to get deeper  And there's no hand cream either  Because that will get it done quicker  You got to go dry  And it can't hurt him  And you know he's going to be soft  So you got to get him hard  Yeah  Like what you have to do  No no  You got to add this scenario  I got to allow him to lick my toes 
[02:19:30]  Because he's into the feet thing  No yeah whatever  Yeah like you're on the couch  And he's laying on the couch next to you  And he's leaning over  Sucking your toes  And he's on his hands and knees  Yeah  And his big fat stomach is hanging  Yeah  So you have to reach behind  With your hand  Yeah  And cup his balls  And reach under with the other  Yeah  And just tug his small fat man dick  I do that  While his stomach is on your fist  Because I learned a long time ago  The only way out of this game  Is just to say yes  Just agree  Agree with what anyone says  Just say yeah I would do that  I learned that a long time ago  Because these games always get awkward 
[02:20:00]  How about if you dozed off with him  Yes I would do that too  How about if you were in bed with him  And he woke you up  By poking his morning heart  On to your backside  And he was kissing your neck  And you could smell his morning breath  In your face  So he gets to go to that Super Bowl  You get to go to it  Yeah  And you can have seats  On the 50 yard line  If he can cum in you  You get a box  At fucking New Meadowland Stadium  For life  But you have to take his cum  Oh my god  Alright sure  Why not  Yes  I'm just going to say yes to everything 
[02:20:30]  Now what would be worse  Would you rather just jerk him off  For two Super Bowls  You don't have to look him in the eye  Whatever you do that  Or would you rather  Spoon with him for a whole night  He's holding you from behind  See that's gay  So what would you rather  Spooning is pretty gay  The whole night  Like you go to bed  At like 11  To like about 7 in the morning  There's like emotions involved  There that's gay  And you guys hold each other  The whole night  Or would you rather  The hand job  Sure why not  I would do that too  No no which one  You gotta pick one  Sure everything  He's trying to get me  Out of my fucking gate 
[02:21:00]  No you gotta do everything  No I'm disagreeing to everything  You can't change the rules now  See I'd rather do spooning  Than the actual fluids  Coming out  Isn't that kind of gay  Yeah well  So he's jerking off  Another guy  But you're not kissing him  Good point  There's no kissing  You're just holding each other  That's gay  I think that part's gay  Holding each other  Everything else is not gay  That's not gay  Yeah  I was not using your hand  That's some other guy  Not gay  As long as you don't  Look him in the eye  Uh oh 
[02:21:30]  Florentine who's winning  What happened  Yeah that's him  What happened  Something bubbling up here  Uh oh  What you  Yeah  What do you got going  Oh no  Oh can you uh  See  Do we have the fart mask  You wanna do the fart mask today  No  It's terrible  Why not  You just got me through  I don't need one  A bunch of scenarios  I've been smelling his gas  For 20 years  Oh you already  I mean I'll do it  I'll take it  But it's  It's  Hey  Yeah  But I  But I actually enjoy it though 
[02:22:00]  I wanna put you on the spot  Like he tries to like disguise it  That he's waving over  You don't have to  Yeah I don't mind  I want you to smell it  I just wanna finish this up quickly  Who wins the Super Bowl this year  Cause you really know your shit  I don't know  I mean you know  What are you thinking  Um  I like the 49ers  Oh god wow  He didn't even give an opinion  My pick is the Niners  You know it's  I like the Niners  It's possible  I don't think Brady's gonna get it done  I think the Pats beat the Broncos  This weekend obviously  Yeah  Giants I pray  They don't have a chance  But they 
[02:22:30]  Everybody's down on Green Bay  For some reason  I don't know why  They're a fucking machine  No cause  I think Green Bay's gonna get by the Giants  Even though I want the Giants to win  And then it's gonna be  It's probably gonna be  It's probably gonna be New Orleans  And um  I don't  I don't trust Alex Smith that much  In a big game  Yeah  And this is a big game  So I just think  You know  Breeze might pull it out at the end  And then New Orleans  Is gonna have to go to Green Bay  And that's gonna be a great game  Wow  That was a bad one  Who wins it all?  I'd see  You know the Patriots could do it 
[02:23:00]  Really?  Yeah  Cause no team has any defense  The  The two worst defense in the league  Satisfied wise  49ers got some defense  I know but I'm saying  Green Bay and the Patriots  Have the two worst defense in the league  So if they're in a Super Bowl  Everybody's  It's just gonna go up and down the field  You know  Someone was talking to me recently  They said  You know how everyone says  Defenses win Super Bowls?  Supposedly that's not true  In the end  No it's not  Well I mean  You know  It did with the Giants  But we all have said that  But the Falcons  In the end  You know a good defense  Wins the Super Bowl 
[02:23:30]  No  And it turns out  That's not really true  Don't last more points  Oh wow  You should do some  You should do some sports talk man  I don't know  Color commentary  Is that too boring for you?  I just know baseball  As a comedian  As a football  No I would love to  I just know those two sports  You don't care about hockey or basketball?  I'm starting to get back into hockey  Not the basketball  Do you watch 24-7?  Well it's over now  No  I went to that old classic  Flyer Ranger game down in Philly  The old dudes  Nick Fatio was out there  It was fucking awesome  Nick Fatio  Yeah 
[02:24:00]  That's a name from the past  You didn't get to go to the real game though?  No I don't like sitting in the cold  It was like 52 degrees that day  Did it look cool being there?  Yeah it was great  I want to go so bad  My chance was fucking Philadelphia  And I blew it  Is Jimmy's Farts bad?  Oh man  I'm sorry  You know what  It's really bad  I've been smelling for 20 years  And I enjoy them  But I have a cure for his ass  What's that?  Like I went to this doctor 
[02:24:30]  Like a few years ago  And he's like  Dude your stomach's really fucked up  And he gave me like this powder  And he put me on this yogurt  And stuff like that  Boom  And he basically  So now I just  I could still  I still have gas  But it doesn't smell anymore  What's this stuff?  What is this miracle stuff?  And I used to be just  I used to be neck and neck with Jim  How bad my gas was  How bad were they at Van Halen?  It was brutal  Oh that's right  You told that story  But I got warning track power now basically  Like I'm the guy that's off steroids  I'm like I've  You know Rodriguez  What the fuck's his name? 
[02:25:00]  Alex?  Ivan Rodriguez  The guy  Yeah  Ivan Rodriguez  Yeah like I got warning track power now  I could still  Once in a while I can hit one out  But not like the old days  I'm a singles hitter  What are you taking now?  I don't take it anymore  But I mean it just  You gave me this power  But a lot of yogurt  You're just eating differently probably right?  No I could still  It's the soda, coffee  And all that shit you're eating  Is destroying your insides  I don't drink that much soda  Coffee's still bad for you?  Yeah  The gum  Coffee's not bad  No I don't chew aspartame gum anymore  Don't say that  The gum I have is fucking  Is no aspartame at all 
[02:25:30]  Nothing  Totally okay for you  Sugar?  No sugar  Hey I  And no fucking  No aspartame  No taste  No it's good  Well language  And Florentine knows music as well  And you guys got to go to Van Halen together  I'm very  As much as I beat up Van Halen  I'm jealous to see him at Cafe Wa  In front of 250 people  I would have loved to have been there  The sound was amazing  They were unbelievable that night  They were really good  Can David Lee Roth pull off the old songs?  Yeah he did it back in 2007  He must have taken singing lessons 
[02:26:00]  Because I never really liked them live back in the day  Yeah  But he's got his shit together  Talks a lot though huh?  Yeah well that will stop  Like it was his home turf gig  You know because his uncle owned the place  So the Van Halen brothers  They allowed him to do that?  Yeah they allowed him  Like alright it's the first night  Let him just do his thing  Yeah yeah  He obviously picked a place  Because that's where he used to hang out as a kid  Sure  So they just said alright  Let him have his moment of glory  But they're going to fucking cut that way back  I want to go on the record  This whole thing falls apart before the tour ends 
[02:26:30]  Something that's going to happen  I don't think  They made like 160 million dollars  Doing that tour for like a year and a half  So it's smart to keep everyone together?  Absolutely  They're going to do it  For the money they'll do it  There's too much money to lose  Did you like the new song we played earlier?  Tattoo  I didn't like the chorus but I liked the song itself  Well musically it sounds like a Van Halen song  What do you think Jim?  Sounds like a throwaway song  But this is the one they really want out there  It's weird because you think you would pick the best song on the record  Like the most commercial song  A really good song  Well that's what they usually do  And just put that one out 
[02:27:00]  And then you know three months later you put a second single out  Everybody has the record they don't care  But you got at this you know whenever you're getting the shit online  You got to put your best fucking song out  And then who gives a shit about the rest of the record  And it was a weird choice to put this one out  It's kind of uncomfortable  It's just yeah the chorus definitely didn't get me  You don't like the tattoo  How'd it go?  I don't know you might have to hear it again  I don't know how the chorus was  You really want to hear it again?  Yes  Just have it Sam  You know when we saw them in the city last week  They played a different song 
[02:27:30]  She's the Woman I think it's called  And that was pretty good  But supposedly that's an old song  That they never really released  I suppose the whole album's basically  A lot of like pieced together riffs  That Eddie's had over the years  Which is fine  Ah there it is  That's classic Van Halen sound right there  Yeah this I don't mind at all  I got Elvis 
[02:28:00]  On my elbow  Yes  Okay  When I'm six  Elvis talks  I got holy girls  On the back of my leg  And she who loves  When I walk  Speaking cherry gray  Screaming electric green  Purple mountains majesty  You can talk to me 
[02:28:30]  Talk to me  Swap meet Sally  Tramp stamp chat  Now swiped among  Showing the time it took  To get that new tattoo  Just sounds a little wordy  I like that part though  I know but then it gets  Just a few  Too many words in there  Or something  Something's not right  I like that part  It's almost a good song  But the tattoo  The chorus is awful  Yeah  Tattoo  Tattoo  I don't care  I don't like how the chorus  Starts the song off either 
[02:29:00]  Cause it's  The chorus is a little corny  To begin with  Yeah  Did you like  Like save that  Two minutes in  When you're like  Oh I liked it  Alright why  Well at least  It starts off right  Bad right off the bat  You think it starts  Up on the wrong foot  Yeah  Like it's like  You pull a chick's  Pants down  And you see the  Fucking genital warts  Right away  And you're like  Fuck it  I'm still going in  Yeah  Well you gotta be  A soldier right  Gotta get in there  Nice to be in first  Gotta get in the jungle  Then notice  Yeah  I mean  I'm gonna go see them  Though fuck  They're gonna be great 
[02:29:30]  They were great  Four or five years ago  They're gonna be  They're gonna be amazing  Did you ever like  David Lee Roth's  Solo stuff  Yeah I did  So did I  Eat Em and Smile  It was a fucking great album  What's on that  The Yankee Rose  I like the song  Ladies Night in Buffalo  It's a really good record  I like the  Shy Boy  A real slow number  Called Damn Good  Oh that's  Yeah that's on his  I really like that song  That's on the second  His second song  I had to play it a lot  When I was still playing music  That's one of the great  That's a fucking great ballad  How many solo 
[02:30:00]  Records did he have  Probably about four or five  Was it that many  Yeah  When did we tap out then  He did A Little Ain't Enough  Was the third one  I forget what the hell  Skyscraper was the second one  Wait let's go  A Little Ain't Enough  Was the third one  And then he did  Your Filthy Little Mouth  Was the fourth one  Did they have any hits  On those albums  I don't know  A Little Ain't Enough  Was the title track  Was the one hit  And Sensible Shoes  Remember that song  No I don't  Crazy From The Heat  Crazy From The Heat  Which one was that  That was off  Eat Em and Smile  That was the first one  Yeah  But that band he had  Back in the day  Steve Vai 
[02:30:30]  Billy Sheehan  And Greg Bisson  On drums  Fucking monster band  Whatever happened  What happened with that  Whole project  It just blew up  They just  Too many egos  In his own solo  Yeah  I think  And Vai went over  To play with Whitesnake  At that point  And Billy Sheehan  Started Mr. Big  And then he disappeared  After that  He was done  Yeah  For a long time  He became what  A paramedic  He didn't need the money though  No  He just needed something to do  How many years  Did he take off  Do you think  God at least a decade 
[02:31:00]  Well he would do  Some gigs here and there  And then he remember  He did that tour  With Sammy Hagar  It was David Lee Roth  And Sammy Hagar  Before Sammy got back  With Van Halen  Oh just the two of them  Right  Yeah they went out  And did that  And that was a pretty big tour  Did they get along  No  Really  They did a lot of press  In the beginning  Like they were gonna get along  And then  Who do you think  His fault you think that was  David Lee Roth  Yeah  Yeah it was a little  He's the common denominator  Is Dave a difficult guy  I don't know  You know he's just  You know  He seems to have  Good taste in comedians  Dave's  Yeah Dave's just  You know look  He's a goofball  He's silly 
[02:31:30]  So that irks  The Van Halen brothers  They don't like  When he comes out  In overalls  And acts like an ass  He's doing like  Almost stand up type stuff  Yeah they don't like that  Train engine hat  Yeah yeah  Remember the  Video Music Awards  From like 96  And they were gonna get together  And he came out  In the overalls  And was being an ass  And the Van Halen brothers  Were miserable  Because they finally figured out  Alright we can get this together again  And then David Lee Roth  Blew it up  In one appearance  Before it even started  Yeah  Before it even started  They were like  Fuck this guy  Yeah and that was it  What year have they broken up  Alright our next presenters 
[02:32:00]  Watch this  Very well represent  Three quarters of one of the  Greatest rock and roll bands  Ever here  Having now officially survived  Their own rock and roll version  Of the Dick York  Dick Sargent debacle  It's Van Halen  Ladies and gentlemen  This was it  This was a big fucking moment  And this is 12 years  They were broken up  Right  This is their first moment  Look at those pants  They've got his pants  Pulled up to his nipples  Hi Wolfie  Hi hon  They're just babbling 
[02:32:30]  Can you pause this for a sec  Is that Chris Rock  Yeah Chris Rock was loving it  He's a big Van  I saw him there  I can't believe what a big  Van Halen fan he is  He's a massive Van Halen fan  If I remember correctly  Help me out  They weren't officially  Together yet  They were doing a  Greatest Hits record  And I think David  Said a lot of things  And Eddie's like  Whoa slow the fuck down  We don't know what this is  They needed one more album  With the record company  So doing a Greatest Hits  And they were going to do  Two new songs with David Lee Roth  Okay 
[02:33:00]  And they were just  That's where it was at  And that was it  Yeah and Dave was talking  Like it was a big reunion  And all this stuff  And it was obvious  They still had some issues  To work out  Yeah and this is when  They were in the middle  Of doing the two songs  And then it just  After this night  It just  That was it  Watch this  I love this thing  Or listen to this  Whenever  People just going  Bullshit for him  That was a big surprise  Right  Oh yeah  I think we're here 
[02:33:30]  To present  Best Neil video of the year award  No no no  Instead of the best award thing  We have to make an announcement  We have to address this subject here 
[02:34:00]  This is the first time  That we've actually stood on stage together  In over a decade  Over a decade  And  Eddie's like  Alright leave me alone  Dave's hugging Eddie  It looks like an over  I don't know  I'll do it for Al 
[02:34:30]  We're here to present  The award for  Best Neil video  Michael  Have you noticed  How things have changed a lot  Since the last time  We were up here  Really  No really  It used to be  I want my MTV  And now it's like  Give me your MTV  Or I'll blow your head off  What  This is getting the crowd pumped  Eddie's boring  Okay  Okay  We'll get  Eddie's pushing him away  Eddie just pushed him away  And that was it  What a baby Eddie is  Well yeah 
[02:35:00]  They're always  The Van Halen brothers  Like you know  Like high school kids  Like oh  Don't do that  You're fucking 60 years old  Don't do that  Every lead singer  Is a fucking  You know  Yeah you're rock stars  Act like an ass  Yeah  They do right  Most of them do  Yeah  I mean let them  They're fucking weirdos  The singers  They are  That wasn't that bad  How did it fall apart  Because we haven't thought  About this in years  And then was it backstage  They did a little Q&A  And David Lee Roth  Yeah and he took over again  Because look  He was taking Alex's lines  And Michael Anthony's  Eddie just shoves them aside  Basically 
[02:35:30]  And then it was all wrapped  Who wants to hear from Alex  Or Michael Anthony  When you're seeing Van Halen  Nobody wants to hear  The fucking bassist talk  What's wrong with these guys  Oh look  You're what the drummer  Has to say  Nobody fucking cares  They want to hear what  Roth and Eddie have to say  It's just the way it is  No one is going to see  Michael Anthony live  Alone  Well he's with Sammy Hagar  No no but I mean  Like his name  With all due respect  Right  You know the guy  They want to see his stupid Dave  Jimmy's not a fan of Sammy Hagar  And his 
[02:36:00]  He's got a good voice  And his party attitude  You don't like  I hate his fucking  You know  Get a whiskey  Shut up  You don't like  Moss tequila  Fucking hate it  One two  Tequila  Two shots  Three four  I fucking hate when guys  I like Moss tequila better than tattoo  I like cold gin by Kiss  Yeah  And fucking  Suicide solution  Those are my fucking  Alcohol songs  How does Cabo Wabo go  Oh  That asshole  What's he singing about 
[02:36:30]  Something in Mexico  With a fucking  His dumb Hawaiian shirt  His fucking open toed shoes  You're like  Fuck you  Meanwhile  If he comes in here tomorrow  Jim's gonna be all over it  Without a doubt  No he's actually good  I know  No one denies  That I'm a fucking weasel  Me  No he's good  He's on our show many times  I like him  He's a good voice  But then something happened  He blew us off last time  Yeah  I don't know  Yeah  When we were doing him a favor  Then he turns around and goes  Nah  I don't need to do that  This song is  Been to Rome  Been to Rome  It's a great voice 
[02:37:00]  That was a great fit for the band  To get Sammy after David left  Yeah it worked  How many years was he there?  I mean people have their camps  But in the end it worked  It worked for the band  They became a lot more commercial  When Sammy took over  Oh yeah  How many years was he there?  He came in in like 86  86 to like 94  Then he was out  And then he came back in  Wasn't that long?  Wow  Yeah he was in about 10 years  And Gary Schroen came in  Did the album in 98 
[02:37:30]  And then Sammy got back with him  I don't know  Like 97  Then he was out  And then he came back in  In like 2001  Did a tour  And that was a disaster  Sammy's book is great  Because he tells the story out  They didn't want him  Promoting his tequila  Cabo Wabo  The Van Halen brothers  They were so mad  That he had this  They were jealous supposedly  That he had this big tequila  So fucking Sammy  Got it tattooed on his arm  He goes okay fine  So every concert  He wore sleeveless shirts  He's like what are you gonna do?  Hey that's great  Why do they care?  They're funny  I don't know 
[02:38:00]  Because they were jealous  That's what Sammy says  Wow that's funny  He sold that shit for 80 million dollars  Wow  His book is good?  His book's great  But you know  He regrets it  Because he called out  The Van Halen brothers  And a lot of stuff  And he regrets it  He's like I totally just  There's no way  Those guys will ever  Get back to me again  That's it  After what I wrote in there  Wow  He doesn't need the money obviously  He said he didn't see  Eddie Van Halen  For like 10 years  He walks in a studio  Like 9 in the morning  They want to get together  Eddie has a bottle of wine  He looks like a homeless guy 
[02:38:30]  And he's like  Eddie  He goes  Why don't you put that in a glass?  He goes  And Eddie's all fucked up  He just looks at the bottle  He goes  It is in a glass  He's like  I knew he was a fucking mess there  Yeah disaster  Yeah and he just told Alex  Van Halen  He used to do a drum solo early  So he'd just get fucking  He'd pound like 50 beers  In one show  So he wanted  Remember  Van Halen shows like this  After the second song  They're doing a drum solo  Like why is a drum solo so early?  Because Alex just wanted to drink  And he just wanted to get it over with  And he had a garbage can next to him 
[02:39:00]  And he would just piss  In the garbage can on stage  Why wouldn't he drink before the show?  He would drink a little before the show  But he just wanted to get his solo  Out of the way  And then he could just get  Completely hammered  Oh I see what you're saying  So after that  He could just go  Yeah and he'd just have a garbage can  And he'd just whiz in the can  The whole time  Fuck man  Is he still drinking?  I don't know  Both of them were big drinkers  Oh huge yeah  And Dave Lee Roth  Not so much  If at all right?  I don't think he was a partier  Don't know  I think more of a weed with Dave  Was it weed?  Yeah  California Girls  We gotta mention that 
[02:39:30]  Alright  That was a fucking  I'm just a gigolo  Just a big one  Holy fuck  Big one  Tobacco Road  And everywhere I go  They were huge songs  I don't know if they hold up  The videos were good  Back in the day  Oh yeah  With that stuff  He knew how to make a good video  All right  I don't think he was a partier  I don't know  I think more of a weed with Dave  Was it weed?

There was a lot of  A lot of kids  A lot of people got in touch with me  After that  I told that story  This one kid  Said that he lived in  He lived in Jersey  Like North Jersey  And this guy convinced his parents  He was like 10  No maybe 12  To come into New York City  Because there was a wrestling match  The next night  Like a Saturday night  So his parents 
[02:42:00]  Drove him into New York  And dropped him off  At this guy's apartment  And he stayed over at his house  To go to the wrestling match  With him the next day  Back then they didn't talk about it  As much  Adults were more trusted  25 years ago  Don't fucking parents  And then  He was all over him  He's grabbing him  And stuff like that  And he's fighting him off  The whole time  And he just started crying  In the corner  So the guy just left him alone  Went to sleep  He slept on the couch  And in the morning  He goes  The wrestling match got cancelled  Tell your parents  To come pick you up  Oh my god  You didn't give me anything 
[02:42:30]  Fuck you  Wow  That's what happened  The match got cancelled  He's not wasting  A good wrestling match on him  It's pay or play  Yeah he had  He had someone else lined up  Is that kid fucked up  Nowadays  I don't know  He emailed me a story  And told me it  I'm not sure  Now being a father  Could you even imagine  Allowing your 10 year old  To go to the city  And stay overnight  And stay  Get the fuck out of here  I can't even find  A babysitter  So I can leave the house  For three hours  I don't even trust 
[02:43:00]  For three hours  Imagine a whole night  In the city  Overnight  Get the fuck out of here  Well my sister babysits my kid  I check his ass  When she's done  To make sure nothing  Was in there  My sister's babysitting too  It's the only one we trust  That and some of the  People from Philly  But  Anyway  What else is in the  One man show  The wrestling story's legendary  And that's gonna do well  Yeah basically just  All the fucked up women  I dated my whole life  And then you know  I had my ex  Die  You know  You finally talked about that 
[02:43:30]  Yeah I talked about that  Yeah  Suicide and all that stuff  And you know  What I did to get thrown  And all that  Go to healers  And all that shit  I gotta ask  Do you make it funny  Or is that taboo  No I mean  It's you know  It's a rough story  I tell about the whole night  And stuff  But then it  Yeah  Then it  It wraps up very nice  Okay  Yeah  It's a  You know  It's a tough  But I gotta talk about it  Right  Of course  If you're gonna do  A one man show  I got you  Little Jim's  And it breaks the ice  A Jim Norton joke  Actually breaks the ice 
[02:44:00]  Yeah  I haven't seen it yet  Because every time  Jim does it locally  I'm away  I can't wait to see it  Yeah I really do wanna see it  Florentine's got stories  Yeah cause there's a  There's a great moment  Where um  Like I read from my  I was writing a diary  When that all happened  So I was telling  You know  Like what was going on  So in one of the diaries  I remember going to my therapist  At one point  And I read from it  During the course of the show  To break it up  Like break up scenes  Oh that's cool yeah  So I remember  When I went to my therapist  He goes look  He goes you don't understand  He goes  When you finally meet somebody  That's gonna take care of you  And she breaks your heart 
[02:44:30]  This is  It's gonna hurt worse  Than what you're going through  Right now  Dealing with the death  I'm like there's no fucking way  How could that be  He goes no  You wouldn't believe me  When you get a connection  To somebody  It's gonna hurt more  And I was writing about it  In a diary  I'm like there's no  I go if that's true  I'll just get hookers  The rest of my life  I go it works  For my good friend  Jim Norton  I go but then again  He likes golden showers  So I shouldn't take after him  So that's  It breaks the ice  After the whole story  Cause I really wrote that  About that  I'm like fuck that  And I'm thinking about him  Well he gets hookers  So it works for him  It certainly does  No broken hearts 
[02:45:00]  Yeah that was a rough  Fucking story  With a hooker  Right Jim  So you know  When you try to save  When you try to save them  And you can't  Oh god  Why would you do that  With your Travis Bickle  Trying to save the hooker  You've not wore bags  With hookers before  Of course  And he's clean  Yeah  Primarily  Since I'm working on  This whole theory  And I know  It's not even a theory  I mean the whole AIDS thing  Is just a myth  Yeah  Especially heterosexual male AIDS 
[02:45:30]  Never happened once  Yeah  Not one documented case  I gotta agree with you  On that one  Not one documented case  I bet if someone says it  There's something going on  I remember when it came  Like 88, 89  I remember when it came out  One in every five  Heterosexual males  Who's got HIV right now  And in two years  It's gonna be one in every two  And you fucking  Everybody flipped  Oh fuck yeah  I thought of  This guy's dying  This my friend  That guy's dying  He's dying  I'm probably dying  Yeah  Look 20 years later  We're all still fucking here  Anyone you know  That did die of AIDS 
[02:46:00]  Had something going on  Intravenous drugs  It's needles  Drugs  Bisexual  Yeah  Little gay stuff going on  No a heterosexual guy  Or a guy could give it to a female  Right  Yeah  They can  A bisexual  A drug addict  Whatever they can give  But heterosexual males  Never transferred from a woman to a man  How about with a cut though  Is it possible  No  If he had a cut in your dick  And there was a cut in her pussy  That's  You know  Look at now  Look at  You know  The AIDS virus  Remember the AIDS virus  Always was in the ass  So you're always like  Alright I'm not gonna fuck a girl in the ass 
[02:46:30]  Because that's where it lives  If she has it  Yeah  So that was all  Now it's fucking ass plays  You know  First date  And nobody's fucking dropping like flies  Nobody's dropping like flies  Yeah  You're right  See now the CDC  They just made up those numbers  They just fudged numbers  Yeah  That's what they're famous for  To scare the shit out of you  What did Eazy-E do?  Do you think he was a DL?  No he was a drug user  Who?  Yeah  Eazy  Eazy was a drug user?  Yeah shooting up  Yeah  And what about magic?  I'm guessing he was  Trannies  I'm guessing he was sitting on things 
[02:47:00]  Yeah  There was rumors  That's my guess  Yeah  You know  A little of  You know  Parties with  You know  Trance sexes  I don't know  It happened  We don't know  I don't  You know  But he sure looks pretty healthy man  Yeah he looks pretty good for that  But I mean  So you know  And if Jim's wore bags  I mean look  Prostitutes  No condom  Come on  Yeah  And he's clean  It's true  Yeah well  He says sort of  Yeah I'm clean  Even the Africa thing  Doesn't make sense either  How it's trans  Oh yeah but in Africa  You know males get it from 
[02:47:30]  No they don't  Why isn't it here?  Does it not work in this fucking time zone?  So you  So you think in Africa  Not a lot of guys are dropping dead from it?  No  Well if they are  It's from doing drugs or whatever  Or they're gay  That's how it's  They're getting it  Why is  How come it hasn't come over here yet?  It's been 15 years over there  Heterosexual males are dropping like flies  But it hasn't made it to this country yet  Yeah  You make a good point  Maybe their dicks are so big  That they just rip  And there's always a cut in the vagina  From their big dicks  And maybe they have big cuts  On their big dicks  And when their big dicks 
[02:48:00]  Rip over a pussy  There's blood  That could be it  And then the cuts are rubbing together  Yeah  Your cut  Her cut  But now the CDC  The big thing now is warts  Genital warts  Genital warts  You know HPV  40 million people have it  No they don't  40 million people do not have it  They're saying  But that's what  Like every girl has HPV  It's bullshit  That's what they're saying  It's you know  They say it's linked to cervical cancer  It's not true  Yeah  Cervical cancer  Yeah  Before warts and girls got cervical cancer 
[02:48:30]  What was that?  Where did that come from?  Yeah  Damn  It's just another fucking shot  They want to give you  Another fucking  Are you against immunizations  Or just a lot of them?  Most of them yeah  Wait  You're not  Your kid's not getting the shots?  You know  He's gotten certain ones  Yeah  Yeah you don't know what to do  We went shots  We went shots  He's got his shots  Yeah my kid got one  He was in the hospital for four days  Oh that's right  Yeah  Yeah  Jesus  Well  That's fucked up 
[02:49:00]  Yeah you don't know what to do  Look  The CDC says  20 million people a year  Die of the flu  Really?  Really?  20 million?  20 million  That's their number  Across the world?  Yeah  Wow you study this shit huh?  Yeah  That's what they throw out  You're not just talking out of your ass  You research some of this?  Those are some weak motherfuckers that are  Yeah  Dying like that  Yeah  I think  Yeah  Alright an 85 year old guy gets a cold  Right  And he fucking can't handle it  He's dropping dead  Yeah  Fuck him  Anything worse?  Fuck him  Anything worse than watching your kid get a shot? 
[02:49:30]  No  Pretty brutal right?  Yeah  Do you hold him?  I had to hold him down  I had to hold my son down in the hospital  I don't  Put an IV  Oh really?  To get blood out of him  Cause he had  You know  And he can't get a  You know  They don't have a vein showing  So it was like  For like an hour  Screaming  But the look they give you  Like what the fuck  You're supposed to be protecting me  What are you doing?

[03:00:30]  We've been away for a long  Long  Long  Long  Time  We've been through changes  We've played some games  The more things change  The more things stay the same  We're a little bit older  But we ain't much like us 
[03:01:00]  We're back  We're better than ever  We're back  We're back  Together forever  We're back  We're back  We're better than ever  We're back  We're back  We're back  Together forever  We're back  We're back  We're back  We're back 
[03:01:30]  We're back  We're back  We're back  We're back  We're back  We're back  O.P. and Anthony  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show  Series X  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts. 
[03:02:00]  We're on.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live, but most of the show is still here.  Jim and Jim.  Great show today, gentlemen.  Thanks. Stop trying to rope us into a conversation.  That's what you do, Sam.  We just didn't have enough time to pack up yet.  Give us time to pack up.  I said Jim and Jim that time, Opie.  That time, I didn't rope you in this time.  Yeah, but you knew that I would be insulted, that you didn't mention my name.  Hence, I would have to say something.  You guys think I'm a genius.  I know your ways.  You guys think I'm buying, like, bad TVs so the listeners get angry and I'm not talking to you because I want you to talk? 
[03:02:30]  This is what you get today, man.  You know, the video of your TV getting smashed by Iraq.  You smashed my TV yesterday.  Jim Florentine is now up on my YouTube channel.  Shut up.  My YouTube channel is Opie Radio.  My Twitter account is Opie Radio.  Like, people don't know that.  My Facebook page is Opie Radio Fans.  Everybody knows this stuff.  And I'm on Google Plus as Opie Radio.  Who's on Google Plus? 
[03:03:00]  Google Plus is starting to take off.  No, it's not.  It's starting to take off at the circles.  It's crashing.  You're in one of my circles, Jim Florentine.  You are on Google Plus?  No, I'm not on that yet.  Oh, then you're not in one of my circles.  But Facebook's eventually going away.  That's my prediction.  It's going to be the way of MySpace within three years.  It's getting too annoying.  Everyone's going to move on to Google Plus or something else that comes out there.  I like the Google Plus.  What about Twitter?  Twitter will be around for a while.  Yeah, Twitter will always be around.  It might change and evolve into something else. 
[03:03:30]  But if it evolves into too much complications like Facebook did, then Twitter's going to go up.  Yeah, Twitter's going to be relevant for at least the next five years.  And then it's going to go downhill.  They'll start getting annoying like Facebook.  Facebook is brutal.  It's horrible.  No, you got fucking pop-up ads.  I got to fucking...  Really?  I can't erase messages.  People are joining me.  Yeah, joining groups.  They're putting me in these fucking groups and shit.  That's why I just deal with a fan page.  Yeah, it's easier.  It's a lot easier just having a fan page.  Yeah, but you can't connect your Twitter and everything into your fan page. 
[03:04:00]  I don't want to.  I do tweets that are just good enough for Twitter, and then I'll take some of my tweets and put them on my Facebook.  So Facebook is like the MVP tweets?  I don't want to be the guy that I tweet and then it goes everywhere at the same time.  I pick and choose where some of this shit should go.  Also because Facebook, people are way more sensitive on there.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  You post a joke about someone homeless.  I did a homeless, and the guy's like, dude, you don't know if that guy was a Vietnam vet, and how could you use mentally ill?  I'm like, really? 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  On Twitter, people don't fucking take it that personally.  Everybody thinks they're your friend on Facebook, though.  Yeah, and you got fucking fat families on there showing a kid's picture.  So, and you do a fucking, you know, a racy joke, and they're all offended.  And here's the difference, too.  I mean, you can update Twitter a lot.  You can't update Facebook a lot.  They get pissed off.  Hey, man, you're taking up my timeline.  Stop taking up my timeline.  Oh, really?  I haven't heard that one, thank God.  That almost sounded like Edgar, Jimmy.  Yeah.  You guys don't post pictures of your kids anywhere, do you? 
[03:05:00]  No.  No, no, they're civilians, you asshole.  I'm not suggesting that you do it.  You just did.  No, I didn't.  I asked you if you did.  They're private.  He did kind of humiliate you for not doing it, and it was uncalled for, Sam.  I was going to ask, what about the civilians that post pictures of their kids?  Because then it's like, you don't even have the choice of not being on Facebook anymore,  because now people are posting, like you said, their kids' pictures as soon as they're born are all over the internet.  Yeah, right, really?  That's just for their family and friends.  These kids aren't in the public eye.  Yeah, but I can find them.  They're not just for family and friends.  If I've seen them. 
[03:05:30]  Well, you're family and friends of some people.  Yes, I have family and friends.  But that's not a solid argument.  That's not what I'm sure about.  That was a good argument.  No, it wasn't a good argument.  I think I give the argument to Jim Norton on that one.  Oh, we've got to go tape.  You're busy, Sam.  You just talk by yourself.  We'll have a good time.  I hope he's still here.  No, I'm going to do something on the boneyard right now.  You're going to tape with them?  Yeah.  I don't know why Jimmy hasn't asked me yet, but eventually.  He hasn't.  Florentine's here, like, for a day, and he gets asked, and Opie never.  You never asked Opie.  What is that about him?  Because it's hard to ask Opie when he's like a fucking ghost disappearing into the elevator. 
[03:06:00]  I would love you to do it sometime.  I would love to have you come on to Boneyard.  I don't know if I know enough Boneyard songs.  So come on and just hang.  Do you go deep?  We don't have to, no.  I don't go deep with Boneyard.  Well, we'll just talk music, though.  Give me a band.  I'll give you a song.  Godsmack.  Godsmack and Motorhead.  Godsmack, I would go with Voodoo.  Great song.  I don't know any Motorhead songs by the name.  How about this?  I swear to God.  We'll do it tomorrow.  Just write down some kind of...  Give me another band.  Even like Van Halen.  Even Van Halen.  Van Halen, I would go with... 
[03:06:30]  Jump.  Jump.  Go ahead.  Who said that?  I'd go with Unchained.  That's a good one.  Guns N' Roses.  I would go with Sweet Child O' Mine.  All right.  Although I like Yesterday.  It's one of my favorite Guns N' Roses songs ever.  How about Ozzy?  Ozzy solo?  Yeah.  Bark at the Moon.  Shot in the Dark is kind of cool.  I'd play both.  I'm trying to do something cool here.  Whatever you like. 
[03:07:00]  Metallica.  Metallica, I would go at wherever I may roam.  Yeah, see?  Sabbath.  Or Sabatru.  Sabbath.  Sabbath, I'm not a big Sabbath fan.  War Pigs, probably.  ACDC.  ACDC, Thunderstruck.  Look at this.  You got the whole fucking playlist.  How about Zeppelin?  Zeppelin's tough because I love all my Zeppelins.  So you could easily find a Zeppelin song.  I would pick anything off Zeppelin 3.  So you know more than enough about music to easily pick these songs.  Let's do this.  My favorite Zeppelin album, Presence.  Very underrated.  Presence is right up there too.  Presence and Zeppelin 3. 
[03:07:30]  I will feature you on the Boneyard tomorrow.  I would like you to be my guest.  Tomorrow I got things to do.  You don't have anything to do.  All right, well then Thursday.  Tomorrow or Thursday?  All right.  All right.  All right.  I got things to do.  We just did the whole show right there.  I don't think you want to do it.  Sam, promote the big smashing of the TV video.  Why would I promote that?  Huh?  Because secretly you love the attention.  We all know that.  If I wanted attention, I would just get it myself.  I have other outlets these days, Opie.  It's okay, Sam. 
[03:08:00]  It's on Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  A-N-D.  Everybody knows the ONA Facebook page.  Opie needs to realize, if he wants to get on other channels, here on Sirius XM.  It very easily could.  Like, it's not, but you don't have to know what you're talking about.  Like, you have any idea how many channels I've been on?  I'm on Faction.  That you don't know what you're talking about?  Yeah, I have no idea what any of these.  I don't even know what kind of music Faction plays.  And I go on Cullen's show on Faction all the time.  You just go and hang out.  You don't have to know anything.  Well, Faction plays the soundtrack to Extreme Sports. 
[03:08:30]  I don't care.  That doesn't make any sense.  It's some hip-hop.  It's some punk.  It's some metal.  So they just play everything.  That's what I'm saying.  It's like a no-frills kind of thing.  Don't get confused.  I don't want to know anything about these channels either.  I don't care.  You just go on.  When people ask you to go on, you just always say yes.  Like Hits 1?  Yeah.  I mean, Hits 1, whatever Mikey Piff puts in the Hits 1 catalog, that's what we're playing.  And you just talk about that.  Wait, you don't pick the songs?  No, I don't pick the songs.  What about listener requests?  If I pick the songs, do you think Hits 1 would be playing Red Solo Cup by Toby Keith? 
[03:09:00]  No.  I don't think so.  We talked about that on the other show.  This is after Open Anthony Live, and it was a great show today.  Alex Jones and what was his name?  Chris Kyle.  Chris Kyle.  Having the big confrontation today.  Alex Jones, I think, buckled a little bit.  I don't think Chris Kyle sounded very different than he sounded when he was in person in studio.  He's kind of a humble guy.  He's not a Hollywood dude. 
[03:09:30]  He's just kind of humble about what he does.  He's a Marine or a Navy SEAL.  It's hard to shake those guys.  You can't tell if he's excited or if he never shows that he's nervous or doesn't know what he's talking about.  He's a humble guy.  He's just like a regular dude.  And that's the way he sounded when he was in studio.  He sounded the same way on the phone, but then Alex Jones realized there's not a lot to call him a liar on.  He wrote a book.  He does have the record for being a Navy SEAL U.S. sharpshooter. 
[03:10:00]  Or is that what they're called?  I don't know.  But the long-distance shooting.  He's got those records.  Sniper.  He's not sitting there bragging about it.  He's just saying that he does.  And then he wrote a book.  Alex Jones obviously didn't read the book.  And so he's saying, well, he's bragging about this.  He's bragging about that.  He's not – he wasn't bragging about anything.  And I think that became clear to Alex Jones.  What I love about Alex Jones, though, is not only does he not see a reason to ever admit that he's wrong, 
[03:10:30]  but when it starts going in that direction, like he's not quite on the same wavelength that he thought he was.  He starts plugging his website.  No, he just moves it.  Like he goes out of nowhere.  You know, we're talking about this.  And he goes, yeah, well, you know, I don't know about Chris Kyle.  He seemed like a good guy.  He seemed polite on the phone.  You know, he's not the type of guy that I, you know, thought I saw in the video.  He seemed like a polite guy.  But there's so much stuff going on.  I don't even know why he's talking about this.  You know, Iowa was stolen from Ron Paul.  Everybody knows that.  It was on major media.  And he doesn't even give you a chance to say, what? 
[03:11:00]  No.  First of all, he says everybody knows that on all these conspiracy plots that he comes up with when I had no knowledge of any of it.  Second of all, he just throws these facts out like Ron Paul had Iowa stolen from him and major media is covering it without citing it and then moves on to the next thing.  The only media that I saw covering Ron Paul having Iowa stolen from him was Alex Jones's website.  So I don't understand.  Hopefully there will be some kind of closure on the Jesse Ventura deal because Ventura still claims that Chris Kyle is a liar. 
[03:11:30]  Even Alex Jones couldn't call Chris Kyle a liar to his face.  He still tends to believe Jesse Ventura because that's his boy.  But at this point, I mean, like there's nobody who's sabotaging Jesse Ventura's presidential run because he's ridiculous.  Like he's a he's he's a character.  He's a goof.  He did a show on conspiracy theories. 
[03:12:00]  Nobody that hosts shows on conspiracy theories where they're trying to expose weather changing machines.  And it just looks like, you know, that scene out of the out of the what's the what's the what's the Christian Bale magician movie?  The Prestige.  It just looks like that scene out of the Prestige where they're going up to Tesla's and they got all the light bulbs on the ground.  Jesse Ventura is there and it's a weather machine.  This is the guy that people are worried about running for president.  Jesse Ventura thinks that people are spreading falsehoods about him because otherwise he might run for president and win. 
[03:12:30]  There is no chance that Jesse Ventura would run for president and win.  Jesse Ventura was less ridiculous when he was a wrestler than he is now just as a public figure being himself.  And he used to wear feather boas and eye makeup.  Like, there's no way that anybody is sitting there going, oh, my God, we have to stop this.  But Jesse Ventura and Alex Jones are on their high horse and trying to make sure that it doesn't happen. 
[03:13:00]  Eric, when you were a boy, were you a Jesse Ventura fan or were you before your time?  Ventura was just leaving as I started getting into into wrestling.  Even as a play by play guy?  Yeah, it was him and Vince just doing the play by play for like Saturday night's main event.  But he wasn't wrestling or anything at that point.  I did want to say we forgot the past couple of days.  We forgot to do it.  Today's a special day and I'm going to I'm going to start with it right now here on after open Anthony live.  Eric got some shit yesterday because we were talking about hoarding and everything. 
[03:13:30]  And as we talked about, you know, we were talking about me and my, you know, old electronics and everything.  The video of E-Rock smashing my TV with a sledgehammer is on Opie Radio on YouTube.  And it was, by the way, I watched the video on YouTube last night.  The video was harder to watch than it was to see the TV get smashed in person for me.  Like, I had an emotional reaction to watching the video of the TV getting smashed. 
[03:14:00]  I don't know.  Like, I just felt like there was more to do with that TV.  I felt like the TV wasn't it wasn't fit to be destroyed.  It was perfectly functional.  And there's just more to do with it.  Like, one day I'll be able to just willy nilly buy massive TVs.  But that day's not today.  I'm not making Opie, Anthony and Jim Norton money.  I'm not making Eric Nagle money.  I'm making Sam Roberts money.  It's a different tax bracket.  And I've got a wedding to pay for now. 
[03:14:30]  And I've got a honeymoon.  And I've got all this stuff going on.  So I can't just be buying televisions all the time.  Oh, these two callers called at the wrong time.  What's up?  You're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  Hey, how we going?  What's up, buddy?  Yep, you lost it.  Next caller.  You're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  Sam, you know you would just jack yourself to death if a wrestler became president.  Oh, you...  Stop lying.  Listen.  Stop lying.  You're right.  No, you would just jack yourself to all weekend long. 
[03:15:00]  Just forget about Jess.  Oh, my God.  If Jesse Ventura...  Thank you.  If Jesse Ventura were to win a presidential election and he were to become the president  of the United States of America, yes, I would sit there masturbating while watching his inauguration speech.  This is true.  What I'm saying is the likelihood of that happening is so slim that there's no way that there's a conspiracy brewing to sabotage this from happening.  If there's anything I could do to make sure that a former professional wrestler were the president of the United States, trust me, I would do that. 
[03:15:30]  Because there's nothing that would make me happier.  But, I mean, there's just no way that anybody takes that seriously.  But I was talking about the hoarding and everything.  And we were talking about how E-Rock kind of hoards celebrity memorabilia.  And he's got a compulsion that whenever there's a celebrity in here, he's got to get them to sign as much stuff as possible.  And what he said was, some of it is for giveaways.  And, ladies and gentlemen, today, E-Rock's compulsion is good news for you. 
[03:16:00]  Because...  I took everything home.  Everything.  Everything.  It's all gone.  You don't have anything here?  No, of course I do.  Because, I mean, I...  It's all here.  I would have taken you seriously because, like, we had the Shark Night DVD.  I took it home.  I really did take it home.  Well, that was unexpected because that would...  Look, that was not for anybody here to have because we just happened to have it in the back.  It was sent to Roll.  And I said, oh, she's in that movie.  She'll sign it.  We'll give it away.  And, apparently, Sam gave it away to himself. 
[03:16:30]  I took it for myself.  I haven't gotten a chance to watch it yet, but I will.  Call in 866-WOW1-WOW and one person is going to get a signed David Duchovny little photo press kit deal.  Oh, you want to do that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're giving away...  Okay, because we had a couple other things here.  Yeah, maybe we'll give them away later if I get to it.  How many David Duchovny's do we have to do?  Well, we have two David Duchovny's.  All right.  And our guest today gave us something as well.  Oh, my God.  We've got so much stuff. 
[03:17:00]  Let me wait until these phone banks fill up because we're on delay.  They'll fill up in a second.  I want to give everybody a fair shot.  There they go.  All right.  So, I guess I'll start with you.  Hello.  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  Hey.  I want to win something.  Are you a David Duchovny fan?  Hell, yeah.  What's your favorite David Duchovny thing?  Uh, X-Files.  Well, that was obscure.  And because you were able to really prove to me what a giant fan you are... 
[03:17:30]  I asked him what his name was in X-Files.  Oh, what was David Duchovny's name?  Mulder.  Mulder.  You got it.  It wasn't Scully.  It was the other one.  Uh, yeah, we'll send you a press kit that's David Duchovny signed.  It's basically like an 8x10 signed by David Duchovny.  It's pretty slick.  So, uh, what's your name?  John.  John, you just won.  You're a big winner.  How does it feel?  Fucking great.  Awesome.  And we're going to go to this one.  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  Hi. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, John's still on.  What's your name?  Brady.  Brady.  Are you also a David Duchovny fan?  I am.  What's your favorite thing he's done that's not the X-Files?  I'm trying to remember the name.  Nah.  He lost it.  See?  You got to be quick with me.  This is a fast-moving show.  How about you?  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  Yeah, I'm a fan of Duchovny's.  What do you like that he did?  Californication.  That works for me.  What's your name?  It's Alex.  Alex.  What's his name on Californication? 
[03:18:30]  What's your name?  What's his name?  What's your name on Californication?  What's David Duchovny's Californication name?  Hank.  That sounds right to me.  I have no idea.  But you just won the press kit, so stay on hold.  Congratulations.  Everybody's a winner here on After Open Anthony Live.  I wonder if Hits One is going to play that new Van Halen song.  I think that in 2012, if there's one thing young people want to hear, it's Van Halen singing about tattoos. 
[03:19:00]  Listen, I'm all for Van Halen getting back together to, you know, tour again.  I get that.  You know, all bands that have great fan bases should be back on tour and everything.  But sometimes you just don't put out new stuff.  Like, when your best stuff is behind you, it's behind you.  You have to realize this already.  Especially when you realize what period of time you're in. 
[03:19:30]  Like, Van Halen has to sit down and realize it's no longer the 70s and 80s.  Like, tattoos are something that college girls get freshman year.  All of them.  Everybody has a tattoo.  Eric Nagel has a tattoo.  I do?  Right above his left butt cheek.  It's a baked potato.  It's one of his favorite foods.  He decided to get a baked potato tattooed on him.  I don't know why.  No, see, that's not true.  I've seen it.  Isn't it, it has butter and everything?  No.  All right, well, you...  You've been looking at somebody else's ass. 
[03:20:00]  If you don't want it public, you don't want it public.  But I'll have you know, yours is the only ass I've been looking at.  Wow.  And in this, in this day and age, is a band really putting forth an edgy rock song about  tattoos?  No.  It's insanity.  That's like early Lollapalooza style stuff.  Like, how early?  Like, 91?  92?  Yeah, and that was when it was sort of like everybody was already starting to get on  the...  Like, tattoo? 
[03:20:30]  That's the edgiest thing you could think of?  Yeah.  Ugh.  Van Halen.  I don't know, maybe they're past me generationally because I'm not a...  I never was a Van Halen fan, but...  Yeah, that seems to be like if you were a fan...  Even with Sammy Hagar going into the 90s, if you grew up with them, you're still with  them, but they're not like a band I don't think you can just discover.  Yeah, I would say their fan base completely cut off by 1990, and beyond that, I don't  think there's any new Van Halen fans after that. 
[03:21:00]  And that's why there's no reason to put out good, uh, new music.  It's not gonna be good.  Yeah, it's not like you accidentally found them like, uh, Led Zeppelin or the Beatles  or the Stones or something like that.  It's like, it was what it was in a period of time, but we're finished with it now.  Why are people still calling in?  This guy just...  Hello, Yarn After Opie and Anthony Live?  What's up?  Everybody's going crazy.  Don't you know I already gave away this stuff?  Damn it.  I mean, people just keep calling.  I gave it away already. 
[03:21:30]  What's your name?  My name's Corey.  Corey, you didn't win anything.  I gave it away already.  I told you that already.  You thought you'd won something just now, right?  Well, you played a fast one on me, Mr. Roberts.  Well, thank you very much for listening, Corey.  Alright, take it easy.  Thanks, man.  We have one more thing.  We'll give it away later.  Oh, we will?  Yeah.  If you want to.  Maybe.  It depends on the behavior of the listeners today.  I can usually figure out what they're doing.  There was something...  Where's the CD?  I wanted to play it in case anybody missed it yesterday.  Do you have the Bob Kelly production piece in there? 
[03:22:00]  No, it's Orange Case.  It was right in front of him.  Is this it?  Yes.  American War Stories.  Bob Kelly.  We were talking about Chris Kyle just now.  And while Chris was in...  That was last week at this point.  Bob Kelly was also in.  And I guess on some level, trying to relate to Chris Kyle.  Chris Kyle is this, like, super...  Like, he's this Superman...  Highly decorated.  Highly decorated, Navy SEAL, sniper shooter, badass dude with a bloody Punisher logo on his hat. 
[03:22:30]  And nobody has the balls to question him type of guy.  Whereas Bob Kelly is a goofy comedian who was trying to relate to Chris Kyle with his Iraq experience performing comedy there.  Roland, you may actually enjoy this.  I don't know if you heard this yesterday, but I know you'll probably relate to a lot of Bob Kelly's experiences.  This is Bob Kelly, War Stories.  On the next American War Stories. 
[03:23:00]  Battleground.  Iraq.  Robert Kelly deploys and within an instant realizes no man can prepare for war.  We thought we were going to starve.  So we, like, brought, like, little, like, bars and stuff.  Like, there's going to be no food.  There was more...  I gained 30 pounds in Iraq.  There was...  You go to the buffet, there's Chinese food, mac and cheese, barbecue, pizza, ice cream.  You can walk up to this ice cream and get as many ice cream bars and sunnies as you want. 
[03:23:30]  But no matter how rich the rewards, every American soldier has to experience loss.  I was over there.  I had two milkshakes.  One of the Marines goes, you're going to have both of those fatty?  So I gave him one, and then my other one fell.  I had to go back and get two more.  So tune in as we chronicle the victories and the defeats for American hero, Bob Kelly.  I broke my knee, man!  On the next American War Stories. 
[03:24:00]  Such childlike glee, as Bob Kelly describes, you could go back and get as many ice cream  bars and sundaes as you could want.  It's almost like Opie when he said the universe is as big as your imagination.  Just this childlike wonder of just, wow!  As many ice cream bars as you want!  The fact that that is the story that Bob Kelly decided to share with Chris Kyle is incredible.  Roland, does that make you jealous that you didn't get a chance to do a tour of Iraq hearing 
[03:24:30]  about all those ice cream bars?  Nah, you can get them here, too.  But they're not free here.  You have to purchase them.  I either purchase them to fly 30 hours or whatever.  I gotcha.  So if it's just a matter of ice cream bars, no Iraq for you.  Yeah.  How's the week looking for guests?  Good.  Yesterday was huge with Seth Rogen and Jim Brewer and Dr. Robin.  Today, another big one. 
[03:25:00]  Not only did you have the great Jim Florentine in, but you at the last minute, you hooked  up the Alex Jones-Chris Kyle thing.  Yeah.  Everybody thinks.  This is why I love when people like Alex Jones say that the Chris Kyle thing that we did  was scripted.  And I've read this before.  Yeah.  On Twitter or whatever.  Like, people think that the bits that we do are at times scripted.  Or anything on the show is scripted.  It's far from there.  Roland, tell me truthfully. 
[03:25:30]  I'm not feeding this to you.  Tell me truthfully.  Um, how far in advance did you get Chris Kyle on the phone to confront Alex Jones?  Um, probably seven minutes.  It was literally during the commercial break.  Opie goes, yeah, let's get Chris Kyle on the phone.  And boom.  Yeah.  That's it.  Like, that's, that's, that's the, that's the plan.  It's like when they die, he came in here, like, um, it was a bit, he was booked like  three weeks out.  Right.  So it's like, I don't, that's why, but that's why the show works. 
[03:26:00]  Like, that's why, that's why it sounds like it's off the cuff and sort of nobody knows  what's going on.  Cause nobody knows what's going on.  We make it up as we go.  Oh yeah.  You got Brewer and Seth Rogen and Dr. Robin.  That's, that's a great combo.  That happened.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the other thing that happened at the last second.  It's not like, like, what's the plan when you booked people to get, uh, Jim Brewer,  Seth Rogen and Dr. Robin in studio at the same time?  No.  No.  Everything followed like, Hey, I'm in town.  All right. 
[03:26:30]  And then Seth at the last minute goes, Hey, I could do Monday.  And it happened to be Robin and Brewer.  And you were sitting there going, well, I can't cancel Seth Rogen.  He's a big star and I'm not going to bump two guests we already booked.  Everybody come in.  Everybody come in and have a good time.  Does that make your life as a booker?  The fact that things are so not scheduled on this show, whereas other shows, people schedule  by the minute.  Um, is that less difficult? 
[03:27:00]  Does that make it easier for you?  Cause you know, you can just bring people in or does that make it more difficult?  Cause all of a sudden, boom, something just changed.  I don't know though, cause there's a story that is happening here and the guest is waiting.  So you, it goes both ways.  Right.  What a stress level for you though?  Is it, does it add to the stress or does it?  It does.  Like it doesn't, it doesn't make things easier.  Yeah.  Whether Chris Kyle didn't answer or didn't, couldn't do it or, or if they get here and  say, or, or if by time, I don't feel like talking to him today.  Let's not do the segment at all. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  Roland, you go take care of it, buddy.  Hey, sorry for waking you up, but hey, go back to bed.  What else is happening this week?  Um, this week.  Can you announce?  Oh yeah.  Tomorrow's Michael Clark Duncan.  Michael Clark Duncan.  And the actor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh, you weren't sure who Michael Clark Duncan was.  I just had a brain fart.  Oh, poor Roland.  And, uh, the West Memphis, the documentary people, the directors of the West Memphis three 
[03:28:00]  documentary.  I think so.  Yeah.  Okay.  And that's the third part.  Obviously the West Memphis three.  If you're not familiar with this case, paradise lost three, it's paradise lost three.  If you're not familiar with the West Memphis three case, go in and do some Googling because  I'm telling you, like most of the people who I've come into contact with who didn't know  what this was, the minute you start finding out what it is, you become completely obsessed  with it.  Now, the fact that those, the, the kids, I was going to say now adults, the three guys 
[03:28:30]  have gotten out of jail now.  At least there's some kind of ending to it.  Whereas before when they were just stuck in jail, everybody was going crazy, trying to  find every detail on this story because now Ron Bennington was in here yesterday and he  believes that the three West Memphis people who were accused, the kids did indeed do what  they were accused of.  And that is, uh, uh, murdering a child.  Ron believes they are guilty.  Now I, that's what he said yesterday.  I'm not sure about that. 
[03:29:00]  And there have been two documentaries so far to document exactly how not guilty they are.  This is HBO.  This is the third.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not like a, uh, conspiracy theory, Alex Jones things.  It's like, I'm telling you, if you don't know the West Memphis three case, Google it  now, uh, or after the show, cause I want your full undivided attention here and find out.  Travis got this one.  Cause the big Travis friend.  Travis has been obsessed with this case for a long time.  He was wearing West Memphis three t-shirts before I even knew what it was.  And then probably three or four years ago, I finally saw the first, the two documentaries 
[03:29:30]  and it blew my mind.  And from that point on, I'm Googling and reading every article I can find, which if you know  my Google skills is three articles, all three of them that I could find.  But like you become completely obsessed with this case cause you go, this, like it's crazy  and all the characters that are involved, it's, it's like a movie except, uh, there's  a horrible end.  There was until they got released a horrible ending to it and it's real life. 
[03:30:00]  Like there's, it's a movie with terrible injustice and then you realize it's actually happening  to somebody.  Like people, you became obsessed with this case as soon as you found out about it.  Right.  The West Memphis three thing.  He booked it, yeah.  Yeah.  And, and it's weird.  Did you find out about the movie first or did you, so you watched the movies and then  you just, I, I, uh, I started on the second one.  So that was like 2000.  So yeah, 2000, I got into it.  And then you treated the first documentary like a prequel. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  I mean, well, the first documentary is great because it's, it's all trial footage.  Well, what's crazy about the documentary is that even the people like while you're watching  the first two documentaries, you kind of think, oh, that guy's got something up.  I think that guy probably had something to do with it.  And then the evidence comes back.  It says that guy didn't have anything to do with it either.  Yeah.  And wait till you see the third one.  Have you seen it already?  Oh yeah.  I saw, um, it, it premiered at the, uh, New York Film Festival.  Oh, so you went to it.  Yeah.  And saw it there.  And the three of them were there, which was really awesome. 
[03:31:00]  They changed the third one at the last minute to add in the ending where they get out of  jail.  It premiered at the Toronto Film Festival and they, they showed how they had intended the  film to be.  And then the New York Film Festival was the debut of the one with the new ending.  So if they weren't, you've seen it, if they weren't out of jail when the movie was produced,  what was the purpose of the third movie?  Just to re-get awareness of it?  Well, yeah.  The purpose of the third movie, it's still called what it was originally called, which is  Paradise Lost Free Purgatory.  Because they're just stuck there. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah, because they're, they're stuck there, but, um, so they didn't change the title of  it, but it would have just been, you know, Damien, Jason, and Jesse are still in jail.  It would have ended with, uh, the fact that they were going to have evidentiary hearings  last December.  And that's where it would have ended.  For a new trial.  And that's where it would have ended.  And it is crazy.  Well, it's good though.  This is like one case where Eddie Vedder, did Eddie Vedder being on board with this?  Nothing to do with it.  Just a coincidence.  I think I was aware of it before he was.  It was just a coincidence.  Yeah. 
[03:32:00]  It's like, celebrities get on board with this.  Like, people will not, was that, I just heard a mic too.  I heard a pop.  I saw the phones go dead.  Oh, that's weird.  Luckily, I don't want to talk to anybody.  Mars, Mars, it's your way.  No, but the people, like, won't forget about it.  No, then there's people that you didn't even know were involved, like Peter Jackson.  Why is it, keep popping!  They're resetting the whole phone system.  All right, let me check.  So if I turn off the things?  Yeah, then you should be all right.  Okay.  And then if I want to give away the thing?  Oh, as soon as we know that the phones are working again. 
[03:32:30]  That's fine.  Peter Jackson bankrolled, like, millions of his own money.  The Hobbit?  Yeah.  Wow.  The Hobbit himself.  Yeah.  Which he didn't even find out until they were out.  Like, everybody knew about, like, Eddie Vedder and Johnny Depp and Natalie Maines.  But, yeah, Peter Jackson, millions and millions and millions of dollars.  And he's still giving them money.  Now, are you with Ron where you think they probably did it?  Absolutely.  And you're just, there's like this whole celebrity thing is just to get these guys out of jail  so we can stick our noses at the system.  We got away with it!  Do they have any idea who did it? 
[03:33:00]  This is what drives me crazy.  Are there theories?  Yeah.  There are a lot of theories, though.  Yeah.  There's a very good theory in the third film.  Don't spoil it for us.  I wouldn't think of.  But it debuts on Thursday.  Thursday night.  On HBO.  On HBO.  The third film, though, it's not one of those things where they kind of string you along  through the whole movie and then you realize that guy didn't do it either?  No.  The third film's great because if you haven't seen the first two, they do a really good  job of, you know, spending the first half of the movie kind of recapping, you know, 
[03:33:30]  the entire story.  So you can watch it.  It's a standalone documentary.  Okay.  That's good.  I won't comment on that statement.  I'm just saying you can watch it.  It works by itself.  On its own, yeah.  Yeah.  I get what you're saying.  Who's tomorrow?  Just directors, right?  Yeah.  How many directors?  Two.  Joe Berlinger and Bruce Anofsky.  Didn't they direct something else?  Yes.  What?  Well, you know.  No, you told me.  Yeah, I know.  I forgot.  I thought you were going to, like, pretend to know.  No, no, no.  I totally forgot.  They did Metallica, Some Kind of Monster.  That's right.  That's right.  Which is really cool, too.  We were talking about that before the show started. 
[03:34:00]  Danny doesn't want to watch it because it makes Metallica look vulnerable.  Yeah.  And they're his heavy metal superheroes.  He can't see them with their glasses on, as Clark Kent.  Yeah, so that could be cool to talk to him about, too, because they spent, like, three  years with Metallica during, you know.  I got to start making documentaries and just hang out with people.  Like, that's a, I've always wondered that, like, in radio, when you interview somebody,  you just get them for 15 minutes in studio.  But if you're doing, like, a magazine article, like, what's his, the guy who wrote, Neil Strauss.  Yeah. 
[03:34:30]  He wrote for Rolling Stone.  He's written articles about everyone.  And, like, him, and he traveled with people.  He spent days with people.  And then he was like, hey, I'll write a book about you, too.  And then you get to spend years with them.  Like that girl who's been following Colin around for, forever.  Yeah.  You know?  But, like, I got to get a job doing that.  I got to learn how to write first.  And then I'll get the job with Rolling Stone because, like, Neil Strauss, he's spent days  on tour with, like, Lady Gaga and Trent Reznor and every, every single person you 
[03:35:00]  can think of.  Well, here's what you do.  The list is as big as your imagination.  Just make a documentary about Rob Zombie.  Oh, that's a great idea.  Now, do I have to get him to sign off on it?  Or can I just start getting, can I just start following him around with a crew?  Yeah.  Just start doing, like, a Finding Rob Zombie documentary and make it about trying to be  And just stand outside his house with a megaphone.  I'll get the address from Tom Poppa if he's still talking to me.  Oh, he's in comments.  He is.  Okay.  You can start there.  All right.  So I'll get the address from him.  And then I'll get a megaphone and say, Mr. Zombie, Mr. Zombie, do you have anything 
[03:35:30]  to say?  And he'll be like, what is this?  I just won't have anything to expose.  I just, my mission will be to talk to him.  Next thing you know, you're spending three years with him.  That would be great.  Hey, I'm here to make a documentary about you.  Will you let me?  And he'll say yes.  I'll start going to his house and he's like, Sam, there's no camera.  Like, Banksy just let Mr. Brainwash hang out with him.  Right.  And that's what Rob Zombie will do.  And Rob will be like, Sam, there's no.  I'll say, this is a great idea.  There's no camera crew here.  It's just you again.  With your iPhone.  Yeah, I'm videoing on my phone this time. 
[03:36:00]  Don't worry about it, Rob.  Just say you want to get comfortable first.  Yeah.  I'm just trying to get to know you.  I'm trying to.  Look at Kevin Smith.  Did Prince ever air the documentary?  Kevin Smith's a documentary about Prince?  Yeah, but it never aired.  The musical artist?  Yeah, he hung out with him.  Or Finger Prince?  No, Prince.  I can't understand what you're saying sometimes.  He did a documentary about.  He's talking about posters.  Oh, he made Prince.  Yeah.  He did a documentary about the artist now known again as Prince?  Yeah.  And he hung out with him for like a few months.  Why didn't he invite any of us? 
[03:36:30]  They say Prince never released it.  That's insane.  Can you imagine?  How come Kevin Smith doesn't talk?  Does he talk about it?  He talked about it here.  When?  Does Kevin Smith talk about it?  Does he?  He'll talk about anything.  I haven't heard him talk about Prince, though.  I don't recall.  He talked about it on this show?  Yeah.  Yes, Fred the Answer Man.  No, I think it's on a night with Kevin Smith on the DVD.  Oh.  Or an evening.  He talked about the experience of doing a documentary with Prince and then him just deciding that  I don't want to release this at all.  So he goes through like this whole big thing and then he doesn't. 
[03:37:00]  Prince just decides that he doesn't want to release it.  Artistically, was that negative for Kevin Smith or was he like, look, I did get to hang  out with him?  I think it was kind of frustrating, but I think he was kind of...  Yeah, but it's also maybe just what you capture on film.  Like that Tribe Called Quest documentary that Michael Rappaport did?  Yeah.  They didn't want him to release it.  Yeah, and they finally gave him, but they didn't want him to release it at all.  I think Q-Tip still refused.  I think he refused to go to the premiere.  He just didn't want it out there.  Whatever.  I haven't seen it yet, but...  And the Lil Wayne documentary that's on iTunes, it's actually really good. 
[03:37:30]  Even Ant enjoys it because Lil Wayne just looks insane.  Like they go into him drinking cough syrup 24 hours a day.  But he didn't...  Wayne didn't want that out either.  It's crazy though when artists approve a documentary crew and then when they're like, here, what  we have is the truth.  They're like, no, no, no.  This is not what I signed up for.  That's why I respect Metallica for, you know, like putting that out because I haven't seen  it either, but...  You haven't?  No.  I had it on...  You don't want them to look vulnerable to you either? 
[03:38:00]  No, you know what it is?  I had it on DVD on Netflix and it sat in my apartment for a year and I never got around  to watching it.  You should watch it.  It's good.  I should.  I might watch it tonight.  Is it on streaming or something?  No, I'll just...  I'll find it.  Oh, BitTorrent.  Well...  I gotcha.  Read you loud and clear, buddy.  What do we got going on today, Mars?  Got a little bit of phone issue here.  What happened to the phones?  Somebody broke their headset.  Who broke the headset?  I don't know.  Who broke it?  Mars.  Mars, did you break it? 
[03:38:30]  No, I did not.  Was it broken out of anger?  Was it broken because of a big head?  I have no idea.  Eric's saying nobody broke the headset.  Why did Mars say that it just stopped working?  That's all it was.  Mars is blaming his incompetence.  Why did you lie?  How is that incompetent, you stupid fuck?  It's so easy to get Mars going.  Mars, you lied about the headset.  I did not.  The headset's fine.  They're not working.  It didn't mean it was broken.  It looks like he had some fun over the holidays. 
[03:39:00]  It looked like he just woke up.  I had fun?  Good morning.  I had a great time.  So the truth is that Mars...  Oh.  That's not nice.  Like Mars is looking very jolly today.  That's not nice.  Well, it's like fat.  You guys gotta be nice.  No, we don't.  For the new year.  Do we?  Yeah.  Look at that.  Is that...  Yeah.  Mars' New Year's resolution is for everybody to be nicer to him.  Exactly.  That's it.  And you're not doing very well.  So when you say Mars is incompetent, you mean because he came in here with no idea what  was wrong with the phone, so he just made something up.  Yeah, he's just like, I'll just say that the headset's broke. 
[03:39:30]  Damn, that's a good headset.  How are you doing, Mars?  I'm doing very well.  Yeah?  How's the phone?  Is that the broken headset?  It is the broken headset in my hands right here.  We gotta...  What happened to it?  Looks good to me.  I don't know.  How come the phones were popping while you were fixing them?  Because I told some intern in there that I was gonna reset the phones...  That's Eric.  He's worked here for years.  He's not an intern.  That's so harsh.  Just a blonde hair.  Yeah.  Is it the blonde?  Some blonde intern in there.  And they didn't tell you that I was gonna reset the phones and you should've put the 
[03:40:00]  fader down, so it's actually your fault, but...  No, it's not my fault.  I wasn't told.  He wasn't told.  There you go.  Whoever you were told, you know...  Didn't relate to you and they're at fault.  They are very much at fault.  They probably didn't know what you were talking about.  Really?  Why is that?  Because of the accent?  No, because you said it in Spanish that was incorrect anyway.  What is it?  In Span-English.  No, it's...  It's not Span-English.  Even that I fuck up, huh?  Yes, you do.  It's...  Span-English.  It's Span-English.  It's Span-English. 
[03:40:30]  You bring the two words together by cutting off the end of one and the beginning of the  other.  Span-English is the entire word English with sp in front of it.  Like Spanish-English.  But that's what New Yorkians do.  That's what we do, man.  We fuck up both languages.  You just fuck everything up.  You fuck up both languages as well as studio equipment.  No, no.  That wasn't me.  It wasn't.  I fix it.  You fix it.  Is it fixed?  No, I have to buy a new one.  Or find one.  Or find one.  Or procure one. 
[03:41:00]  No, no.  We procure things around here.  I got you.  We do not steal.  Mars is like Red from Shawshank.  Yeah.  You just get him.  Yeah.  Just get him.  You're the guy.  He's been known to get things from time to time.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, did you see Californication last night?  No, I don't watch that show.  Did you?  Anybody?  Sorry, Rowan.  I haven't watched that.  Who is that sister?  Sister.  Now, is it somebody's sister?  You're referring to a black woman as a sister.  I am speaking about a chocolate.  Oh, my God.  He actually, you actually called a black woman a sister? 
[03:41:30]  She's a senior thing.  Is she?  Really?  A sister.  You don't know her?  I forgot the name of that.  I was trying to look for her.  I can't find the name.  Did you enjoy the new Van Halen song?  You're a Van Halen guy?  The fuck out of here.  Sister.  Sister.  I enjoyed the song we went to break with Jay-Z and Diamonds.  That was pretty cool.  That was all right.  Yeah, you never heard that?  Never heard that.  It's a big song.  You've heard that before, right?  Of course I have.  It's a big song.  Okay.  I've never heard it before. 
[03:42:00]  Is that okay?  That's not okay?  No, that's okay.  It's fine.  That's okay.  You've heard that song before?  It's just like Bruce.  I don't care about the other stuff.  Yeah, Roland.  I mean, if Springsteen's not on the track, Roland doesn't know.  Is he okay?  You sick today?  No, I just lose my voice.  Yeah, you don't sound good.  Because after the TV thing, I walked in here and then went home.  My voice was gone.  You think that you have breathed in toxic chemicals from E-Rock smashing the TV?  Yes, from hearing serious radio, yes, I did.  You think, but none of us did.  Sue, Sue, Sue.  Just you. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  Yeah?  That's the only possible explanation.  Who are your musical influences?  Who's your favorite band, Mars?  Who do you like to listen to?  It depends on what genre.  When you throw the iPod on, when you're, you know.  When you walk by the gym like I do.  Exactly.  When you're watching people.  At least I stop and look.  Yeah, when you're watching people use a treadmill through that window going, one day, one day.  One day.  What are you listening to?  Actually, I listen to dance music and you know that.  You do? 
[03:43:00]  Yes, you do.  I don't remember Club Mars.  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  Mars used to come in.  It still goes on.  It does.  Mars, we used to catch him.  I didn't realize he was still doing it.  But he came into the studio and it would be before the show started.  It would be like five o'clock in the morning.  And we would get here, the staff, and all of a sudden we have monitors in the office.  And our monitors would just start blaring techno music.  Just like whatever house music.  It was Jersey Shore shit.  It was terrible.  And we would go into the studio and Mars used to play dance music. 
[03:43:30]  And I guess still does.  Absolutely.  And we'd go, Mars, what are you doing in here?  And he'd go, test it in the studio.  Absolutely right.  Right?  Tell them about dance music, Troy.  Yeah, dance music's great.  It's the shit.  Yeah, but Mars tests the studio with it.  Like, he just sits in the studio.  Sounds good, man.  I blast the fucking speakers.  Yeah, a lot of bass.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you dance?  No, I shake a little bit like if I'm a DJ.  What is that?  Like that.  Oh, my God.  Sorry, it's a visual, people, but you do like that.  I mean, no, no, no.  Don't say sorry.  You should say sorry to us for having to look at the visual. 
[03:44:00]  Move your head like this side to side.  You're welcome to the people at home.  It looks like when you ask him a question, he does that.  Yeah, he looks like a bobblehead doll.  Don't you do that, Troy?  How do you, don't you like the beat?  No, because he gets pussy.  I mean, you feel the music, sure.  Yeah, but I understand that in a club atmosphere.  Like, I understand if you're DJing, you're going to play dance music.  Yeah.  But if you're just like sitting in the studio before O&A get here at 4.30 in the morning.  It's good, man.  It gets the blood pumping.  You like it. 
[03:44:30]  You do like that, dude.  Fuck yeah.  Dance music's great, man.  Eric, are you a dance music guy?  Not really.  That surprises me.  I don't know any of this stuff.  You don't?  What's an artist that you listen to?  Avicii?  Avicii.  Yeah.  I can do something right now.  How's that?  What are you going to?  Detroit Play.  What are you doing on the board right now?  Are you going to a different channel?  Avicii Levels is the song that Flo Rida uses in his new song.  Really?  Yeah.  Are you going, like, are you just putting in a different channel on the board?  Uh-huh.  So are we going to listen to somebody else's channel? 
[03:45:00]  If we allow it.  I will.  No, I think this is fun.  I just like to know what's going on.  Yeah, but you don't know what you're going to get.  It might be a shitty mix.  Yeah.  And we don't know if that's...  Nah, the board's dead.  Mars, you have no idea what you're doing over here.  You should just set Avicii Levels and...  Why don't we just have Eric play it?  Play it now?  I'm looking for something.  Okay, hang on.  Of course.  I'd love that because it's Scott.  Oh.  Nope.  Not that one.  We just put on Howard.  Dude.  Mars, get away from the board.  I would probably stop there, dude.  Mars, boo.  Here's what Mars is doing. 
[03:45:30]  Mars is playing Howard Stern and not fixing the phone.  Yes.  Is this up-to-date dance music?  Well, there's different styles of dance music.  This is very in sync to me.  This is very sort of Euro 90s.  What he's talking about, Avicii is a producer that's very kind of like synth-y, like that  big synth-y sound.  The stuff I like is a little bit more dirty, a little more raw.  Is he the Blackberry Guy commercial?  Is he?  I don't know.  This doesn't seem cool.  Well, that's a bad song. 
[03:46:00]  No, this is like...  You're right.  This is much better.  Remember the songs that Sporty Spice did after she left the Spice Girls?  Nope.  She became like, Eric, find that song.  I found Avicii, if you want to hear some of that.  Okay, let's hear Avicii, because Mars, this is not...  This is feminine.  Levels, right?  That's the song?  Yeah, you have to fast forward a little bit, and then you can hear what it is.  Because that, Mars...  I don't know how to fast forward.  I mean, that was a very feminine track.  Travis, Dr. Day, your diagnosis?  Very feminine?  Yeah.  Oh, I know this from the Flo Riders song. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, well, this is a beat.  He originally did the song.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm giving it a chance.  That track was horrible.  Well, it was a guess.  I didn't know what was on it.  Yeah, but you liked it.  But you liked it.  It was all right.  I get this a little bit.  It's a little bass, at least.  But, you know, when you're in a club and it's pumping, it's cool.  I mean...  That's why I'm okay with it in a club, just not okay with it, like, sitting in a studio  at 4.30 in the morning by yourself.  Does he drive his kids around with this on?  Do you? 
[03:47:00]  Yes.  You do?  Yes.  You drive your kids?  Yes.  Yes.  What's the problem?  You're not worried about, like, sort of them being like, Dad, I like this music.  Also, I like guys.  No.  You're not worried about that.  No, because they'll see things like Rihanna, for example, and, you know, my little boy loves  Rihanna.  Yeah.  Put some Rihanna shit on.  Like, I'm not going to hate on Rihanna.  You're not going to see me doing that.  All right.  Yeah, Troy?  No, I'm going to show you some good dance music.  I don't know if I want... 
[03:47:30]  I don't know.  Okay.  I mean, if you don't want it, I won't give it to you.  No, no, no.  I want to hear it.  I'll hear it.  All right, Eric, let me...  Eric, are you just enjoying this now for yourself?  Give him some ambiance.  Eric's kind of just bopping in there.  He's just his new blonde hair.  All right.  Let me hear...  Let me hear Troy's...  DJ Troy...  Because DJ Troy Kwan is actually in the mix.  That's right.  In 675 Bar.  Like, you're just plugging the thing he used to plug.  You don't even know if he still plays...  No, I was at 675 last night.  I'll be there again Thursday.  675 in the West Village.  Which bar?  Which bar?  675 Bar in the West Village.  Do people as old as Mars go there? 
[03:48:00]  Easy!  You're supposed to be nice!  You're right.  I forgot.  Jeez!  It was just a question.  I didn't realize that would come off as rude.  Do you have people in your 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s?  Easy!  Late 50s.  Does Mars go VIP?  No, Mars wouldn't go VIP.  Bottles on the VIP.  Mars can't spell VIP.  Let me tell you something about Mars going to clubs.  I will never, ever wait on a line for anything.  That's because you stay home.  I mean, you don't have to.  There's no... 
[03:48:30]  That's because Mars gets there and he finds out there's a cup.  Mars, there's no line to DJ, to club iTunes Shuffle.  See, what's Pasha playing?  What's that?  Pasha.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  I don't trust Mars.  Pasha is the club to go.  Troy is a DJ.  Troy knows.  Yes, he is.  Okay.  Not you.  Not you.  These guys...  This is designer drugs.  These guys...  No, that's too commercial.  You think that's a little too commercial for you? 
[03:49:00]  That's too commercial.  If you hear it.  I want to see what Mars wears when he goes to the club.  You wear like those shiny ecstasy shirts?  Shiny?  Which of those?  Like those...  Like the button-down shirts that are very shiny that the kids...  That's what the kids are wearing nowadays?  No, they did in the 90s, though.  Oh, well, tell me what they're wearing nowadays and I'll go ahead and wear it.  Like in a Mace video.  That's kind of cool.  This is designer drugs.  They're the shit.  This is their new mixtape.  You think this is too commercial?  Not this.  This is a different track, right?  Yeah.  Than the other one.  Yeah, this is better.  I can get that.  This is better. 
[03:49:30]  It's just nasty.  It's dirty.  Yeah, I can get down with that.  Yeah, that's cool shit.  Roland?  Too much cutting, though.  Fuck no.  I just don't like it.  You're more of a...  Bruce.  Born in the USA!  Yeah, I just can't do that.  You're more of that guy.  What if there were Bruce Springsteen remixes?  Well, then we're talking different things.  And we are...  Actually, feedback is coming in.  We're going a little old school with this.  Buttery Beats, huh?  Buttery Beats, that's it.  Yeah.  You like the Buttery Beats.  Up Nose, Up Nose, yeah.  Up Nose, ups the man.  He doesn't listen to that bullshit. 
[03:50:00]  No, you listen.  You want to...  Linger longer.  You want to hear something that...  Longer Linger!  Rihanna, S&M.  That's a song.  That incorporates what I really...  Rihanna, S&M.  You're talking like there's a new song.  No, I'm just...  We don't even play that on Hitsone anymore.  I'm giving you an example.  That's all shit.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Prince Purple Rain.  Mr.  Oh, wait a minute.  What?  What he just said.  Purple Rain.  I saw her in concert.  She sang Dirty Nicky. 
[03:50:30]  Is it Dirty Nicky?  Darling Nicky.  Darling Nicky.  Thank you.  Well, I...  Darling Nicky.  And then it goes into S&M.  In concert.  Great shit.  Rihanna's the fan.  Mars has never been more excited...  Why is it skipping around?  Turn it down.  ...to show me pictures of something.  What?  You want to see her again?  No, I don't.  Hold on, hold on.  The day after he goes to Rihanna, he has to show me his shitty BlackBerry pictures.  What?  Troy, are you a Dirty Phonics guy?  I don't know.  Dirty Phonics.  Then you better be up on that because Rory in Philadelphia is.  Okay.  Maybe it's his band. 
[03:51:00]  He's just trying to get some sense.  How close was the motherfucker?  Oh, my God.  How close was the motherfucker?  Look, Travis, I understand you're gay and everything, but Mars should have been excited  to show you this.  Can you send this to me?  Yes.  You made me that picture?  Mars is showing...  How did you get these seats?  You paid a lot of money or you know someone?  He paid a lot of money.  He doesn't know it.  Is this a Ticketmaster Lucky or StubHub deal?  No, buddy.  You just fucking put up the duckies, man.  The greenbacks.  You get the duckies?  This is a picture.  What row were you in to the stage? 
[03:51:30]  That right there is about third.  Third row.  Yeah, because it looks front row from here.  He's right at the foot of the stage, low down.  Obviously, Rihanna's raised, and he's behind her, and the shot is from the heels up, perfectly  centered.  An amazing, amazing picture, Mars.  Hats off to you.  You can listen to whatever you want.  Please send me that picture.  I was still hoping you would delete it.  No, there's no way.  Because she's almost, she's very close to wearing no pants.  And you know, very close.  Do you know who authorized that picture? 
[03:52:00]  Authorized?  The wifey wife.  She said, take that picture.  Wow.  Isn't she cool?  I guess.  I love her.  I mean, it's not like she lets you, like, go bang some groupie or something.  You just took a picture of the girl who was on stage while your kid was in the audience.  It's not like, wow, you guys must be swingers or something.  No, no, no children.  No, it's just my wife and I.  And you don't know what happened after the concert.  You just went, you're a man of a certain age at this point.  You went, just you and your wife, to see Rihanna. 
[03:52:30]  Correct.  You didn't bring the kids.  What the fuck you bring kids to a concert for?  What is wrong with you?  To a Rihanna concert?  Do you know the fucking things that were walking around there?  Yes, they were all your kids' age.  No, actually, it was a full range.  It really was.  Now, honestly, she had young to, you know, vintage.  Listen, I'll go to, at this point, Travis.  What?  That's where I came from.  Vintage.  If your kid is two, and if you went to a Rihanna concert without her, I'd be like, really? 
[03:53:00]  Shouldn't you bring your kid to that?  Really?  Yeah, you bring a two-year-old to a Rihanna.  No.  Is it too loud for a two-year-old?  Yeah.  Outdoor concert, you can get away with.  Gabba Gabba?  Well, no, Gabba Gabba's inside.  No, like, we took her to go see Primus, like, and that was outside.  Okay.  But, because, you know, sound.  I've been to concerts that I would criticize Mars for, for not bringing kids.  What's this picture?  That's from the front.  That's good, too.  You have a new voicemail.  I want to touch that.  I like the one from behind. 
[03:53:30]  Yes, that was the best.  That's a very good shot.  Yes.  Like, I've been to see Britney Spears and Lady Gaga.  Right.  There are kids at these concerts.  No, no, no, no.  Those are concerts that if you have kids, you should bring to.  No, no, no.  Especially, like, how old is your oldest?  13.  13 years old.  Of course, it's old.  Should be at the Rihanna concert.  Easy.  I'm Puerto Rican.  I had her young.  Not that young.  Damn.  I mean, like, we all remember when we were 13.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  You remember your kid being 13.  So, that's the difference.  But, I'll tell you something. 
[03:54:00]  You know, there was this guy, right?  I'm at the concert.  I'm enjoying it.  I'm up there, chilling.  She's singing all cool, right?  I've seen that.  Right?  You're at the Rihanna concert.  Right.  At the Rihanna concert.  And I look down lower end there, and there's this dude.  Mm-hmm.  Looking up, and he's, like, just gazing at her.  And he's got this look on his face, like, oh, my God.  I'm in heaven, right?  Sure.  Almost practically drooling.  Sure.  Okay.  So, I fucking start, and I turn around, and I laugh, and I point at him.  And I go, look at that motherfucker.  Look how much to my wife.  Look at that motherfucker.  Look how does he enjoy it. 
[03:54:30]  And she goes, yeah, idiot.  That was you two minutes ago.  Ah.  Wasn't that funny of a story, actually?  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I'm going to take a phone call.  It's going to help you out, though.  All right.  Thank you.  James.  I've got it now.  James.  Yes, sir.  You're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Great.  I was hoping you might be giving away one more prize.  That's right, James.  How is that going to help me?  I did just something to move off of that topic.  Just some kind of segue, because there was nothing to do after that. 
[03:55:00]  James, did you like Jim Florentine?  Are you a fan of his?  Yeah, he's a fine character.  Yeah, he was good on the show today, was he not?  Yes, sir.  I only caught the tail end of it, unfortunately, but yes, sir.  Well, luckily, you're going to be able to hear Jim Florentine whenever you want to.  Is it here or see, Eric?  It's here.  Okay.  You're going to be able to hear Jim Florentine whenever you want, because...  Is it signed?  Yes, it is.  Because we have a signed Jim Florentine CD for you, Eric.  It's a CD DVD.  Cringe and Purge.  Eric, tell them all about it. 
[03:55:30]  It's Jim's new CD, Cringe and Purge, signed by Jim Florentine.  And it's a DVD, too.  It is a DVD.  Is it?  It's a CD DVD.  CD DVD, James.  Congratulations.  Holy shit.  Thank you, guys.  Very much.  This is the greatest thing that's ever happened to you, is it not?  It is.  It is the best thing that's happened this week to me.  All right.  I'm going to put you on hold.  Thank you.  Congratulations to James.  Mars, I'm going to see how...  Yes, sir.  Because even I know this DJ that has been said to me, he's the DJ of the moment right  now.  A lot of buzz.  And he's on television and everything, so... 
[03:56:00]  Which one?  Laidback Luke, Testa...  Siesto, which one?  You know Skrillex?  You don't know Skrillex?  I know Skrillex.  Of course.  He's nominated for five Grammys.  But Mars, you don't know him.  Yeah, I do.  You didn't know him.  No, you don't.  All right.  Whatever.  Where do you know Skrillex from?  I don't know.  You don't know.  He thinks you're talking about candy.  I don't know anything.  Yeah.  He is nominated for multiple Grammy Awards.  Okay.  You'd think he'd be more in tune with...  Okay.  So what's your question? 
[03:56:30]  That was the question?  That was it?  That I...  Yeah?  I don't know.  Okay.  I don't know.  So play something for me.  No, I'm not going to play any Skrillex.  He's relatively new, right?  Relatively new, yeah.  And he used to be like a punk rap kid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's really known for putting dubstep on the map.  Yeah.  Is that where you want to be?  Where Skrillex is, Troy?  I'm not really into dubstep.  I like it.  I appreciate it.  But it's not really my thing.  He's huge right now.  I would be a bigger fan of it.  I just don't know what it is.  Dubstep.  You don't know what dubstep is?  No.  Well, you know in that Flo Rida song where it breaks down to like a halftime?  It's basically like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, and a halftime of that. 
[03:57:00]  Boom, boom.  Oh, got it.  Boom.  And it's like wobble bass.  It's like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  I got it.  I got it.  That's dubstep.  Yeah.  And then it's like real kind of like industrial sounding noises.  Well, listen.  I would have this DJ sesh to help everybody out as long.  That's what I call it.  Sesh.  Sesh.  I'm sorry.  There are no sisters here to help me out with the lingo bars.  Oh, by the way, I'm working on a new mix.  I'll have it done.  It'll be ready to go.  You can check out Troy Kwan on SoundCloud.  Really?  You should promote it on my iTunes podcast. 
[03:57:30]  Let's do it.  We were talking about SoundCloud, right?  Yeah.  That wasn't about.  Sam Roberts on iTunes.  Oh.  We'll be back tomorrow with more After Opie and Anthony Live.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are next.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
