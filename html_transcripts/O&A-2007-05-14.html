<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the recent firings of several radio personalities, including JV and Elvis, and Don L. Rollins, lamenting the increasingly sensitive climate in radio and the pressure to maintain a consistently "nice" on-air persona. They contrasted the stricter regulations of broadcast radio with the greater freedom of XM satellite radio.  The hosts then discussed Jim Norton's edgy stand-up comedy and the challenges of controlling a free-flowing, unscripted conversation.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to promoting their upcoming "O&A Childhood and Virus Comedy Tour,"  detailing the many comedians involved (Bob Kelly, Bob Saget, Frank Caliendo, Jim Norton, Louis C.K., Otto and George, Patrice O’Neal, Rich Voss, Stephen Lynch, Carlos Mencia, Joe Rogan, and Louis Black) and its planned format, including pre-show tailgating and "O&A Villages."  They also discussed their "Pests," their dedicated fan base.  Tracy Morgan's recent alleged inappropriate behavior and subsequent misdemeanor battery charge were discussed, leading into humorous anecdotes about Opie's encounters with Derek Jeter and Dennis Leary. The segment ended with a listener, Susan Wallman, providing an overly dramatic account of Roger Clemens' return to the New York Yankees.

A caller then recounted his experience getting pulled over after speeding in his high-performance car, providing details of the incident and humorous commentary.  This was followed by a segment focusing on a 911 call from a police officer who had overdosed on self-made marijuana brownies, prompting anecdotes about the hosts' and Jim Norton's experiences with marijuana.  A substantial portion of the show covered E-Rock's participation in a weight-loss bet, including details gleaned by a restaurant "spy" and a phone call with Lily, whose father owns the restaurant.  Ozzy Osbourne was mentioned as an upcoming guest, and eventually arrived in studio.  Additional segments covered a poorly-executed mock school shooting drill and a swim coach accused of secretly videotaping students.

Ozzy Osbourne's in-studio appearance dominated a large segment.  He discussed Black Sabbath's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, his frustration with music critics, the challenges of a new Black Sabbath album, his stage presence compared to Ronnie Dio's, and humorous anecdotes about midgets on stage, interactions with German authorities, and numerous blackouts from substance abuse. He detailed waking up in unfamiliar locations after blacking out, including once sleeping through a concert in Banham Island.  The conversation also touched upon OzFest, *The Osbournes*, his children's activities, and his current health.  A "Daily Dump Report" highlighted Ozzy's profanity during the interview.  The segment also included discussion of a new Ozzy Osbourne single ("I Don't Want to Stop") and album (*Black Rain*), and an off-topic discussion about a woman who survived internal decapitation.

The show continued with a discussion about a woman with a severe neck injury, possibly resulting in temporary head detachment, and a related anecdote about one of the hosts' brothers and a lacrosse injury.  This transitioned into further discussion of E-Rock's weight-loss bet, including an on-air weighing and a detailed discussion of his underwear color.  The hosts then promoted their Texas Hold'em tournament in Atlantic City.  Other segments included listener calls, a news story about a misrepresented cruise ship incident, the price of postage stamps, and "Jim's Hot Celebrity Gossip Mondays," covering Paris Hilton, Tori Spelling, Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, and others.  Finally, the show concluded with discussions of a man accidentally shooting his wife and a carjacking involving a 91-year-old World War II veteran, along with a celebrity leg-guessing game (revealed to be Melanie Griffith's). E-Rock was present in-studio for a portion of this final segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  I can't take this anymore. It's an awful, awful radio show.  We're really, really mean-spirited, evil people who can't see the good in anything.  I think we've done a good job so far of being open-minded and broad-minded.  You know, like when you try to call the police when I touch you.  I don't call the police. I just pretend because it makes you touch me a little harder.  Oh, God. 
[00:00:30]  Excellence in broadcasting.  It's too bad you've got to have some form of intelligence to listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's be honest. You probably didn't graduate high school.  You probably have three or four kids, and you're probably a grandma at the age of 32.  So I guess we have to give that much to you.  Tony, I'd like to apologize. I probably don't apologize.  Go away.  Jail is better than this misery I'm in. 
[00:01:00]  I'm about Anthony.  I just think Nazi, and I can't get it out of my head.  I'm about Jim Norton.  Hilarious! Hilarious, people!  You guys ready to laugh?  It's got to be the greatest thing ever.  I'd sooner have a water-drinking contest.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Nothing to see here. 
[00:01:30]  Move along, move along, move along, move along, move along, move along, move along, move along.  Good morning. Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hope our show's good enough for David Hinckley.  I don't think he enjoyed Friday's show. 
[00:02:00]  He really didn't like Friday's show.  No.  Friday's not dirty enough.  Yeah.  I know.  That's pretty much what he did.  He was complaining it wasn't filthy enough.  I guess we're in the Daily News today, and it's pretty much a review of the show we did Friday.  Reviewing Friday's show.  Thanks.  Way to get the big picture, David.  Thank you.  Way to get the big picture.  Couldn't you have reviewed a show maybe a month ago?  Yeah, right?  You finally decided to review a show, and it's Friday's? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Friday's Bore Fest?  I don't know.  I think we came up with a lot of new cool features for the show.  I kind of like the new features.  Yeah.  What were a couple of them?  What are you eating for breakfast was a bit.  Mispronunciation Friday.  Mispronunciation Friday, where all of a sudden we just mispronounce a word.  Sing-along Friday.  Yeah.  What's your beef Friday?  All brand new bits for the Opie and Anthony show.  Where do we begin today? 
[00:03:00]  As we have bullseyes on our backs.  I can tell you this much.  More radio guys got fired just for being radio guys.  Yeah.  A couple of more casualties.  It's got to end.  We've got to start pushing back.  A couple more casualties.  In this wacky radio war thing.  I say to our enemies, in radio that is, are you with us or are you against us? 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  I've heard a lot of stuff over the past weekend and Thursday and Friday and stuff from a lot  of reporters and newspapers and columnists, talking heads, things like that.  But the most shocking thing is hearing from the DJs, the other radio personalities and  what they have to say.  And it is an odd tack that these guys are taking.  Some people are supportive of anything that goes out over the air.  They understand the freedom of speech issues and the responsibilities that you have to take 
[00:04:00]  when you're on broadcast radio and the responsibilities you have to take on satellite also.  But to then just come across and look at it like it doesn't affect you is kind of silly  because we are in this climate that makes it very difficult to just go on the air as radio  personalities and do a show and leave at the end of your show knowing that you're safe, 
[00:04:30]  that your livelihood and job is safe.  It's very difficult in this day and age to do that.  And not just for wacky, fun radio shows, but for political talkers, for anybody, because  you never know now what a guest might say, what you might say in just a passing, fleeting  moment about somebody, and it makes it very difficult to sit down in these seats and do 
[00:05:00]  a radio show like this.  Yeah, most of these guys that we're talking over the weekend, they can't see past their  own selfishness.  Yeah.  They smell blood, so they're like, well, I guess I could get some more radio stations  if I play this right.  And they don't look at the big picture.  Yeah.  Because you're going to be next.  I've been doing this my whole life.  And this could be our last show.  Tomorrow could be our last show.  That's the environment we're in now.  You know, people are listening to our show very closely every day, waiting for us to  screw up.  And it's going to be over the most, the stupidest thing eventually. 
[00:05:30]  Eventually, it's going to be over the stupidest thing.  And most people, especially in the media, have no clue, have no clue how a radio show is done.  First of all, all three of us, yes, all three of us consider ourselves funny, consider ourselves  comedians.  We are trying to entertain people on a regular basis.  Every morning, we're trying to get some jokes out there, get people laughing, maybe get you  to think a little bit when we go serious, okay? 
[00:06:00]  So what you're saying is that we should put a little more blame on Jimmy Norton.  He doesn't seem, he seems to skate.  Yeah, well.  You are the Brian Boitano of the show.  Who's that?  He's a skate.  Well, speaking of which, I went and saw Jim Norton at Caroline's over the weekend, right?  Opens up with one of the sickest jokes ever.  And I'm thinking, wow, if that was on the radio, we'd be fired.  It was a good one, Jimmy, was it?  And that's the difference. 
[00:06:30]  For now, you can still say some crazy stuff in comedy clubs, but who knows where that's  going eventually?  Who knows?  And there was a table, because not everyone that was at Jimmy's show were hardcore fans  of Jimmy, because it's in Times Square, so you get some of the tourists coming in.  Jimmy knows.  There was a table right next to me.  Man, these women were on the other side of middle age.  They were on the upper side of middle age, if you know what I mean.  I have no clue.  I have no doubt.  I have no clue who Jimmy is.  They're in town for some convention or some dump thing. 
[00:07:00]  Let's go see a comedian.  So they decide to go see Jimmy.  Jimmy opens up with his joke, and I quickly, naturally, I look over at this table.  I'm like, I want to see the reaction of someone that isn't a hardcore fan of Jim Norton that  expects some edgy stuff, right?  They are laughing and laughing.  They can't get enough.  And I'm like, oh my God, is that telling?  Is that telling right there?  You'd be surprised what people, you think you know what people are going to laugh at. 
[00:07:30]  I had a family last night.  There were two girls, a mother and father from England.  And my act can be pretty rough.  And I'm like, this is a family.  It's Mother's Day.  I'm like, oh, they were fantastic.  I can't believe the stuff a family together laughed at.  I wanted to scold them.  It's all with you people.  And Jimmy's just ripping through his act, getting massive laughs.  And yeah, some of the stuff is downright, you know.  Brutal.  Thank you.  Yeah, it's brutal.  Brutal.  I think we have to educate the people out there. 
[00:08:00]  Most people don't understand that 99.9% of this radio show and radio shows just like this are unscripted.  Unscripted.  Flying by the seat of our pants, just trying to make something happen on a daily basis.  Yeah.  Unscripted.  They think like when something crazy is said, that it was planned all along and oh.  It's scripted.  It's sketchy.  Yeah, the scripts were handed out to everybody.  All right, everyone play there. 
[00:08:30]  Overall, we think this is funny.  Half the time when you screw up, it's because you're just trying to entertain.  It's conversation.  Right.  And the fact that you have to really check yourself during a conversation makes it very difficult.  But we have as far as FCC rules go and stuff, we've understood that for many years and what is allowed and isn't allowed.  But now there's this kind of new thing going on, which makes it very difficult to just get on and converse. 
[00:09:00]  And like I said, the show is over and then you go, wait, what happened?  And then you think back at something you said and went like, wow, that?  So it does make it very difficult.  It's also a unique thing you were saying about Jimmy and his act and everything.  When will it get to the point where because of what you do in another occupation, it'll carry over to radio or television or wherever else? 
[00:09:30]  Like we run on two platforms.  I mean anybody who's read the paper over the past few days knows we're on FM radios, a couple of AM stations I would gather, which is broadcast radio and XM satellite radio.  And with that said, can I say just really quickly, if you're listening to us on FM, the bosses over here have completely believed that we have have followed regulations perfectly in the last year since being back on regular radio.  We have a bunch of safeties in place. 
[00:10:00]  But there's confusion about that.  Yeah.  There's a bunch of safeties in place over here.  Over the years, they've learned, we've learned how to deal with things like the FCC and interest groups.  We just know how to deal with that here on the FM side.  XM side, it's still a little vague as far as what – it's like the Wild West over there.  But they've got to kind of hand out and learn – like FM learned over the years, it has to be learned a little bit what's going on. 
[00:10:30]  A lot of people – and I use the Wild West because that was quoted in the paper also, which –  No, it's very accurate.  But satellite radio is the Wild West.  We don't even – we haven't even started building our cities over there on XM.  We're still just getting the lay of the land and figuring out, oh, this would be a good place for a city.  This would be a good place for this.  Yeah, it is totally the Wild West.  It's just pretty much anything goes right now. 
[00:11:00]  And they're trying to figure it out as we move forward.  As we move forward and more people now are coming out and trying to get their opinion of what should and shouldn't be on satellite radio.  Now, that's a whole other issue.  But I was thinking about this over the weekend.  Again, it's – we're in an odd position whereas we do both.  And people feel that because we do one type of show on satellite that sometimes we should be held responsible no matter what else we do. 
[00:11:30]  Even though we haven't done anything, quote – and I say, quote, wrong since being back on regular radio, they still feel what?  That because of some of the crazy stuff we've done over at XM, that we should be held accountable for this side of the show.  Yeah, either this side or even if we wanted to do some television or things.  Like it's this odd situation now whereas I've always seen it as somebody that has a network television show, let's say, a comedian. 
[00:12:00]  And then they do an HBO special where they just use foul language and are completely politically incorrect.  Is there ever this outcry to have them removed from their network television show because of what they've done?  Like I know Chris Rock has a show.  He's not in it but it's about his life as a kid.  And he says some heinous stuff on stage but hysterical but if you linked the two together, people would look at that as silly and go, no, that's a stage act. 
[00:12:30]  This is this.  It's kind of an odd position we're in whereas that's concerned that we do both but people see it as one, one thing.  You know, it's – I don't think people are really grasping that.  Yeah, well, so we wake up in a very strange position, very strange position.  You don't know – you really don't know what to do with a radio show anymore. 
[00:13:00]  So JV and Elvis were fired on Friday.  Yeah, yeah.  And another guy who's hilarious, I always – Don L?  Don L. Rollins, yeah.  Don L. Rollins was fired from a hip-hop station here in New York over the weekend as well.  We're doing a quick throwaway line about – it was a Jewish slash black joke.  Yeah.  And he got fired for that.  Yeah.  It's completely insane what's going on in radio.  Well, there's a –  Completely insane. 
[00:13:30]  There's this oversensitivity, I guess, that's going on that it makes it, like I said earlier, very difficult to do this type of show.  And once this type of show is gone from the airwaves, people that feel empowered at times, that have a few victories under their belt, don't just stop.  They never have.  They don't just stop.  They move on to the next thing.  And the next thing will be –  They move on until they are officially stopped. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  And that could take a really long time.  But they move on to shows like Hannity, Limbaugh, even Al Franken, what he was doing.  I mean just this – I think they're safe now for the time being because they have this political affiliation and any retribution they can then attribute to their political affiliation,  which is really like this freedom of speech issue really comes into play, like, hey, I'm being persecuted because of my ideology in politics. 
[00:14:30]  Now, if Hannity said something off the cuff or Limbaugh has been known to say things about Obama that are considered racist by some groups,  but to pull Rush Limbaugh off the air, there would be a big argument about why he's being pulled off the air.  Is it because of his political affiliation, because he is so – such a supporter of the right and the Republicans and Bush, 
[00:15:00]  and is it the liberal left that is taking him off the air?  And that in itself is very – a very compelling argument for the First Amendment.  When you have a show like ours, which is based in comedy – occasionally we do touch on some serious topics, but it's just based in – it's a comedy show.  It's easy – it's an easier target because we're not doing anything really seriously.  There's no way we can turn around and say, hey, you're infringing on our rights because we represent this. 
[00:15:30]  We just represent the common man that's going to work, that wants to have a few laughs in the morning with off-the-cuff remarks as you would hang out with your friends and buddies.  When you're hanging out with your pals, a lot of stuff slips out that if the public heard it, you would have to apologize.  With XM, it's different.  That's not regulated.  It's what I consider a private club because it's a pay service.  There are a lot of issues with the satellite side. 
[00:16:00]  But the thing is, there has to be a little more education, I think, as to what people are sensitive about.  It doesn't make a lot of sense to put radio in one context.  That's what I was thinking.  Radio seems to be just radio.  Television, you have comedy, drama, science fiction, news.  You have goofs on the news. 
[00:16:30]  Let's say you take someone like Stephen Colbert.  Very funny.  It's a parody of someone like O'Reilly.  What he says about President Bush and how he talks to politicians, if someone like O'Reilly did, he'd be fired from his job.  But Colbert does it, and people know because of its context as a comedy show, it looks like news, it plays like news, but they know it's a comedy show.  So he gets away, he gets certain liberties with that because it's comedy. 
[00:17:00]  Radio, we're all under this one umbrella of radio.  There's no context to comedy or news or any other type of free-form talk.  It's all – we're all under this same umbrella of we have to be like Edward R. Murrow.  We have to have this dignity that is in radio.  And the second you cross that line, you're all of a sudden chastised and persecuted, and people ask for the removal when there are contexts to what you're doing. 
[00:17:30]  If we were a news show and we said half of the stuff we say on a daily basis, we'd be thrown off the air.  We're not.  We're a comedy show.  But for some reason, we're still held to this standard.  There's this radio standard that television doesn't have, movies don't have it, movies again.  They have children's movies, dramas, science fictions, horror movies. 
[00:18:00]  There are all these separate things that fall under the movies, but they're all judged differently because they are different movies.  You don't take a kid to go see one of the Saw movies, and an adult is going to be bored crapless at some of these kids' movies.  But for some reason, they don't fall under just the umbrella of movies.  Radio, it's just radio.  And everyone's held to the same standard, and that can't be.  And you keep saying standard, and that standard is very invisible right now. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Someone decided, I don't know who, but all of a sudden, out of nowhere, that everyone that's on the radio should be nice.  Yeah.  That's the standard that we're supposed to look up to now.  Right.  We're supposed to do nice slash responsible radio.  Yeah, I...  When did that happen?  And who decided that?  Who decided that?  I don't know.  It wasn't...  I honestly don't think it's the marketplace.  I mean, you know, when you let the marketplace judge things, people get thrown off the air because their ratings are bad. 
[00:19:00]  Because no one's listening or watching a show or going to a movie.  It gets pulled from the theater early.  This is how the marketplace judges things.  It's never...  And most of the show is being thrown off the radio in the last whatever.  It goes back a bit even before IMIS.  The marketplace did not decide that.  No.  Some little, little, little, little special interest group that, you know, scared the corporation decided that. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  It should be the marketplace.  It should be you follow FCC regulations, you follow some maybe company policies, even though I hate to say that.  But, you know, you do work for a company and they do pay you.  So you have to deal with some of their dumb rules.  But besides that, that's it.  FCC regulations and maybe some company rules.  Do you remember any TV shows being taken off because of public outrage on anything where the marketplace didn't dictate?  It was always because of poor ratings. 
[00:20:00]  It's because of poor ratings.  Or if you got caught in a porno theater doing some crazy things.  All right.  No, that's a very good point.  That's a good point.  I mean, we've got to keep it fair.  Keep it fair.  Pee Wee's Playhouse, although I think he was going to give that show up anyway.  But he was taken off the air because of something he did off the show that was considered indecent.  And that show was pulled.  Okay.  How long ago is that?  That's who knows. 
[00:20:30]  And that's 15 years ago.  I was going to say about 15 years ago.  That's an old example.  But even that, you can see he's a kid's show kind of.  And again, context.  You know, he's doing a kid's show and he's in the news doing that.  Although I used to watch the show and loved it.  Catch it in reruns.  God damn, that guy's funny.  But it's in context again.  Kid's show, maybe what he did was inappropriate and a little hard to kind of get that point across to the children as to what he was doing. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  But just radio has no context.  It's all, we're all under one umbrella of morality and decency and ideals that.  All that, which started only months ago.  Yeah.  Out of nowhere.  And it wasn't the FCC, by the way.  I don't get it.  We're under the same scrutiny as NPR.  Yeah.  It doesn't make sense.  We're just getting warmed up, obviously.  We got a lot to say.  So, you know, we wake up this morning with more DJs being fired for just trying to entertain their audience. 
[00:21:30]  And, you know, doing an unscripted 99.9% unscripted show where you're freewheeling and just trying to get some entertainment out there.  And you slip up.  You say something stupid.  And now we live in a day and age.  You get fired for that.  Yeah.  And your career is completely destroyed.  I'm sure JV and Elvis have been doing this probably close to 20 years.  They're now gone.  Do they purposely go out on their show to try to do something very hurtful? 
[00:22:00]  Absolutely not.  20 years?  I don't think they're as old as we are.  Eh, they might have started at, uh...  Maybe 10 years.  No.  19...  15?  I'm 15.  Fine.  Whatever.  But now their careers are completely destroyed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I'm his 35, 40 years.  Boom.  Gone.  Gone.  Just because he was trying to entertain people.  Yeah.  Not because he was trying to be hateful.  You were.  So I ask...  Literally under the gun.  So I ask our enemies today.  I don't...  We could go back to beating the crap out of each other and fighting for radio stations and all that. 
[00:22:30]  But we ask this today.  Are you with us or are you against us today?  And by us, we mean the collective of radio people also.  We could go back to beating the crap out of each other six months from now.  Whatever.  That's what I enjoy the most from this business, by the way.  Going after these idiots.  It's a lot of fun.  But today we ask, are you with us or are you against us?  Because don't think they're not taping your show and waiting for you to screw up. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, believe me.  Believe me they are.  What do you say, Howard?  Are you with us or are you against us?  Yeah.  Maybe it's time for a little uniting.  What do you say?  What do you say?  Or are you going to let your own selfishness get in the way?  And then it's going to be too late for you as well.  It's a rough, rough situation.  All right.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE.  All I care about is that we're not here doing radio and Tracy Morgan tries to kiss us. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, my God.  Let's get into that.  That is so Tracy, man.  Love him.  I hate to say it.  Oof.  Yeah.  We've got some stuff to talk about today.  So it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Stay there.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and Live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Too bad it's not Air Guitar Friday. 
[00:24:00]  I know.  This is the one, man.  Got to wait.  Got to wait a week.  All right.  We'll wait until Friday.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Speaking of virus.  Virus tour.  Yeah.  We'll talk about that in a minute.  All right.  Actually, what I want to say is good morning to the Pess.  The O&A Pess.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you to the O&A Pess. 
[00:24:30]  Jimmy, you want to explain the Pess to the average listener?  There's a lot of people kind of getting into the show.  We're all over America.  We're in two countries thanks to XM Satellite Radio in general.  And people still don't know what an O&A Pess is.  There are listeners and then there are pests.  Pests are, ever been somewhere in society and there's a person that you just hate and they're  bothering you and you want to avoid them?  At all costs, yeah.  That person with an Opie and Anthony shirt.  Yes.  They're psychopaths. 
[00:25:00]  They're very hardcore, psychotic fans.  They're very, very good.  Well, they're hardcore fans.  They're the ones that are definitely going to the O&A Childhood and Virus Comedy Tour this  summer.  Absolutely.  They're the ones that buy the products from the sponsors.  They're the ones that write their letters when you have to write a letter, if you know  what I mean.  And without any prodding from the show.  Right, right.  A lot of shows have fans, people that listen, but they have to tell them, yeah.  They have to tell them.  Sign up for the army.  Could you guys do this for me? 
[00:25:30]  Or we need a letter writing campaign.  Or we need this or that or the other.  The pests know to take it upon themselves.  They are an autonomous group of aggravating people.  It's our own special interest group.  Yeah.  That we, I guess we kind of like threw them in this direction.  Back in the day, we kind of hinted that it would be good to maybe unite and get a very  strong fan base.  Well, we knew because of the type of radio we've done in our own past history that we 
[00:26:00]  need people like this.  And boy, did they run with it.  Totally.  And a lot of people that I've been talking to in the last few days, I'm like, I swear  to God, I have nothing to do with this.  They did it on their own.  I know.  How many times did you have to say that?  Yep.  Like, no, I, they just do this.  This is what they do.  Yeah.  Well.  Yeah.  So if you're a sponsor to the Opie and Anthony show, they are buying your products.  Trust me, they are.  They're buying tickets for our comedy shows all over America. 
[00:26:30]  They're the ones that will be in Atlantic City this weekend for the poker tournament.  Yes.  The PES rule.  And I want to say good morning and thank you to the ONA PES, okay?  Also, peopleagainstcensorship.com, a brand new, a brand new organization that has popped  up and has made a bit of noise in the last few days.  They're organizing.  They're in their infancy pretty much.  But, man, gaining some steam and really doing a great job.  They apparently had some kind of a nice gathering here in Union Square over the weekend, which 
[00:27:00]  got a good amount of people.  Yeah.  I was busy taking meetings.  But.  Where are you?  Yeah.  On the weekend.  Saturday afternoon.  Jimmy's leaving the program.  You heard him there first.  That's it.  Jimmy's gone.  That's right.  Damn.  He doesn't need this anymore.  Are you kidding me?  Aggregation.  What else do I have?  All right.  Listen.  What else is there?  Someone I know have a CB.  I'll be sitting in the cab of some fat trucker's truck as he grosses me and kisses my neck.  I'm trying to be funny on the CB. 
[00:27:30]  Anthony, you did mention the ONA travel and virus comic talk.  Yes.  I just had that thought in my head.  And I definitely want to thank the pest this morning.  But, yeah, we're doing seven dates, possibly eight.  And it all starts at Jones Beach, June 16th.  It's eight or nine of the comedians you know and love from the show.  If you're a relatively new listener, trust me, eight or nine really, really funny guys.  Most of the names you should know, like Bob Kelly, Bob Saget, Frank Caliendo, Norton, of course, Louis C.K., Otto and George, Patrice O'Neal, Rich Voss, Stephen Lynch, Carlos Mencia, Joe Rogan. 
[00:28:00]  It goes on and on and on and on.  And the lineups change depending on the date.  Because a lot of the fans are going to go to a couple different shows because the lineups are different.  Louis Black is actually doing a PNC in Jersey.  I forgot.  Louis Black has been added.  Yes.  I'm very excited about that.  And the names change because of the dates and because certain people want to punch other people in the face.  Well, that's true.  That's true. 
[00:28:30]  I know I said Carlos Mencia and then said Joe Rogan right after that.  I'm not stupid.  I know.  I know I did that.  It's like a battle royal.  Yeah, it really is.  You should have something like that.  One of them should be on stage doing their act.  The other one comes out with a chair and hits him on the back of the head.  Oh, we had to jockey around these lineups, man.  All right, this guy hates this guy.  All right, so we'll put this guy in Detroit and we'll put this guy in the Boston show.  Comedians second only to radio personalities.  What do you mean?  This guy doesn't get along with it.  All right, we'll have to separate these two.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  Wait, this guy, if we put him on first, by the time this guy.  Oh, there's going to be trouble.  By the time this guy comes to the venue, this guy will be back in his hotel.  Oh, the negotiating and the figuring out what we've had to do behind the scenes.  So it's Jones Beach, June 16th.  We've got Mohegan Sun on June 30th.  Tweeter Center for everybody in the Boston area on July 21st.  We've got Detroit, August 4th.  We've got Washington at the Nissan Pavilion in actually Bristow, Virginia, August 18th.  PNC Bank Arts Center, Omdell, New Jersey, August 25th. 
[00:29:30]  And Tweeter Center for everybody in the Philly area across the river in Camden, New Jersey, September 15th.  Take us through Ticketmaster.com.  Don't forget, it's like a rock concert.  We've got the tailgating.  Like the Pets get together.  They're already figuring it out for each venue.  Each venue, they're like, well, obviously, Mohegan Sun, the tailgating is going to be a little rough because it's a casino.  And also, it's going to be tough to have an O&A Village at the Mohegan Sun.  So if you are going to Mohegan Sun, which is great, you're missing out on some of the elements of the show. 
[00:30:00]  I'm not saying you shouldn't go to the casino because just being in a casino, it has its own, you know.  Yeah, it's fun.  Its own fun.  But some of these shows will not have the O&A Village just because we can't figure that out.  And the O&A Village will have just tons of things for the fans to do before the show.  We take a golf cart through and hang out in the parking lot with the listeners, pop into their areas. 
[00:30:30]  They set up like little camps and stuff.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Everyone having a good time.  Last year, Jimmy Mooning, the parking lot, was one of the highlights as far as the tailgating portion of the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy.  Yeah, that's on video.  It's great.  Yeah.  I was holding on to the back of that golf cart and my stupid ass is hanging out.  I had this fear that I was going to fall off and scrape my hiney for four yards.  That would have been great.  Yeah.  So, I mean, these shows, the actual show, close to three hours at some of the venues.  And then you got the O&A Village for about an hour, hour and a half before the show starts. 
[00:31:00]  And then before that, you got the tailgating.  So, obviously, it's an all-day thing.  And afterwards, we hang out with everybody as they come over and we sign stuff and hang out and drink some beers with the listeners.  And it's a huge event.  Yeah, the Camden show, we stayed at least two hours after the show.  So, middle of the night, just signing and meeting fans.  It was hanging out with a few thousand people.  It was very, very cool.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, speaking of comedy, our buddy Tracy Morgan's in trouble. 
[00:31:30]  Tracy.  What happened, Tracy?  I want to get Tracy on the phone.  Yeah, can we get Tracy on the phone?  Would he talk about this?  I don't know.  I remember his last faux pas when he got caught driving home.  Yeah.  And perhaps he had had a few beers.  Perhaps.  He pretty much admitted it.  Oh, yeah.  On our show.  And he was trying to get out of that.  And the story of him trying to get out of it.  Oh, come on.  Yeah, yeah.  It was really funny.  Well, DJ, he's in Miami.  And a DJ filed a misdemeanor battery charge against him. 
[00:32:00]  See, right.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  I'm skipping ahead.  That's right.  Apparently, he inappropriately groped her, according to her, at the Florida radio station.  Her name was Eulica DeCastro.  She said he smelled of alcohol.  Well, that's Tracy.  And he touched her shoulders and arms and kissed the back of her head.  And she apparently pushed him away.  And he was escorted out by the people he came with.  Wow.  But, I mean, touched her arms and shoulders. 
[00:32:30]  I've seen him do this.  Inappropriate.  I've seen him do this.  I like the softball game and stuff.  He comes up and, you know, Tracy's all smooth.  Yeah.  It's weird hearing coming from someone other than Tracy.  He said he wants to impregnate me.  Domingo told the Associated Press.  He said, well, you know, she didn't make that up.  I heard him say that.  He said that to me.  I've heard him say that a few times.  Yeah, he doesn't really mean anything by that.  At the softball game.  He's only joking.  He was coming up to one of my girlfriend's friends that were there and doing pretty much 
[00:33:00]  the same thing and just going, I want you to have my daughter.  You got good hips.  I want you to have my daughter.  You got good birthing hips.  Yeah, he was great.  But, you know, I guess.  So they're going to arrest him for this?  Some people aren't that accepting to this kind of behavior.  Well, probably not.  They're deciding if they should file charges.  They canceled the shows at the Improv in Coconut Grove.  Really?  Yeah, which, if it's for the same reason when I was there, it's because no one wanted to 
[00:33:30]  come.  But I have small crowds.  Poor Jimmy.  A fire would have been a bigger draw than I was.  That's a weird market for Opie and Anthony fans.  Yeah, very, very few.  And comedy fans in general.  Fuck weird.  No, I hear the same thing from a lot of the comics.  It's a tough draw down there.  Unless you're mewling cocaine and you're fished out of the water, which was dropped off by  small planes.  That's a fantastic place for comedy. 
[00:34:00]  By the way, Jimmy was doing a joke there.  Oh, right.  See, we got to educate the people that have no clue what we're attempting here.  We didn't even know we were going to do this break.  See, this is how it works.  Like I said earlier, 99.9% of this show is unscripted.  Freewheeling, just trying to get some laps in.  That's all.  Who could have been offended?  Coke moles?  Hey, in this day and age, who knows?  That's true.  Who knows?  Coke moles or Coke mules?  Mules.  Oh, I thought you said a mole.  Coke moles.  That would be silly.  You couldn't fit much Coke in a mole.  Not at all. 
[00:34:30]  What an awful cocaine dealer you'd be if you carried them in the moles on your cheek and  arm.  Hey, hey.  I was thinking little mice-like moles.  Those little mammals that live on your lawn.  Either way, we're asses.  Either way, it's not much Coke.  I thought you slipped because you just saw my face with the moles disappearing.  I didn't even think about it until you just brought it up.  Oh, they're gone.  Huh?  You're healing up nicely.  Man, I picked the perfect week to destroy my face.  Yeah.  Thank God you were in hiding.  Thank God no one really wanted any video of me this past week. 
[00:35:00]  So I figured, ah, what the hell, I'll get a few of these moles removed.  Oops.  Good timing.  I have the worst timing.  So that's it with Tracy.  So they're deciding if they're going to file charges.  Yeah.  This is just what Tracy does and has always been doing.  That's not a battery, though.  I mean, what are they going to do?  I mean, what kind of criminal charges is that?  It's like, it was such a, you know, it's stupid, but I wouldn't say that's a battery.  Guys.  What?  Come on now.  Huh.  Be a little more sensitive.  Well, this is a perfect example why we don't have women working for our radio show. 
[00:35:30]  Mm-hmm.  Maybe we should just stop there.  Well, I mean.  Maybe we should just stop.  Oh, my God.  None of us drink.  So sometimes if you smell of alcohol, sometimes your judgments have been impaired.  Here's what I'm going to say.  I wasn't there.  I don't know what went on.  If this woman feels that she was assaulted in any way, it's well within her right to take whatever action she deems necessary. 
[00:36:00]  And it's within Tracy's right to defend himself vehemently.  Why would she feel assaulted?  Is she a Yankee fan who actually believes in the moves they made?  Those dopes.  Eight games back.  Goody, goody, goody.  Nice change of subject.  God, Yankees.  I'm so happy they suck.  I cannot get over this.  I couldn't be happier.  Go Red Sox.  For the new listeners, a year ago, Jimmy was probably the biggest Yankee fan.  And now a lot of people in the New York area are yelling and screaming like, are you crazy? 
[00:36:30]  I'm so much bigger a fan than he is.  I'm sure they are and they were.  Jimmy was way up there.  And now he hates them just because Dirk Jeter blew him off at a function.  Beyond blew me off.  He was extraordinarily unpleasant.  Completely blew me off three times to sign a photo of he and I together.  And I said, I will.  I still acknowledge he's the best shortstop in the history of the franchise.  He's the first ballot hall of fame.  And the guy's a great player.  What do you do with your Dirk Jeter signed baseball?  I have it displayed in my apartment.  Of course he does. 
[00:37:00]  I'm not an idiot.  If Hitler signed a baseball, I'd put it up.  I mean, come on.  It's a name.  Ty Cobb wasn't exactly a friendly fella.  I'd certainly display his stuff.  I got a Dirk Jeter thing and a Mariano Rivera ball.  But see, they went out of their way to make sure he signed baseballs for us.  No, that was very sweet of them.  All right.  And I have my Jason.  Jason Giambi, who was the Yankee I didn't like for a long time.  Yeah.  Give him a bat.  I met a bunch of the Yankees at a function, and I did not like one of them.  I think they were all rude. 
[00:37:30]  All of them were snotty.  Robinson Cano was awful.  And boy, Giambi stopped and talked to every fan.  And I liked him for that.  And he signed a bat for me recently.  Yeah.  I guess I'm kind of on Jimmy's side because we went to this function.  Now, granted, XM paid for it.  It was like $1,000 a plate or something.  No, no.  $25,000 a table.  $25,000 a table.  There was like six or eight of us in the table.  It went to four – yeah, it was probably eight at a table tops.  It was $25,000 a table. 
[00:38:00]  And I guess I'm with Jimmy.  It wasn't like we all of a sudden saw the Yankees having a team dinner somewhere before  a big playoff game.  Right.  It was at a function where, yeah, you're paying $25,000 a table for a good cause, by  the way.  Jeter's charity is a very good cause.  And you would just think they would mingle with the people a little more.  They actually had an invisible line.  It wasn't an actual rope.  But we all were in this huge banquet hall with all the tables.  You've seen it, right? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  But in the front of the room is where all the Yankees and their families and, like,  the real celebrities were hanging out, by the way.  Uh-huh.  And if you try to approach those tables – and it looks like you could because you're in  this big room.  Right.  All of a sudden there was just an invisible border and security came out of nowhere to  stop you from going any further.  So you're talking about any Ron and Fez party.  That's pretty much the way they run their parties.  We sit there.  Yeah.  There's an invisible line.  Don't come near me.  Yeah.  There you go.  You know how you had to get Yankee pictures?  He had to hang out with Roland by the men's room and catch him as they were coming into 
[00:39:00]  the toilet.  That's great.  They love that.  Anyone would love being approached by the bathrooms.  Well, there were very few people there.  Very few people were waiting, lurking by the men's room.  Why are you giving out one of your best tips of getting an autograph or a picture?  I've only done it that one time.  He wants to meet people, too, going into the bathrooms.  Yeah.  Hey, fella.  I was doing it at the urinal.  I would actually – why don't I just put my arm around?  I just looked over at my friends at the camera.  Take a picture.  See, people get confused because they think you're a celebrity. 
[00:39:30]  You don't have to go to the bathroom or anything.  And Jimmy hadn't figured this out a while ago.  He's like, wait a minute.  He's just like me.  He's going to have a full bladder eventually.  Exactly.  So Jimmy just hangs out outside the men's room.  And then these guys go –  They're cool.  And these guys go without their security because they're like, no, I'll be all right.  I'm just going to the bathroom.  I'll see you back at my table.  All right.  And then he got him one after another.  And I would – look, again, I've met enough people to know when someone's being cordial.  And the only one that had any – like that was really nice was Giambi. 
[00:40:00]  And it was – the rest of them were just – they were dicks.  Really?  I hated it.  I couldn't believe it.  All of them.  Lairitz, we had interviewed.  We had Jim Lairitz on this show who hit one of the most important Yankee home runs in history.  And we were all hanging out.  He was great.  He was two hours with us.  He did the walkover.  We hung out.  And he was fantastic.  We had so much fun with Lairitz.  And I saw him.  This is maybe a week later at that dinner and said hello.  All I wanted was a hello from the guy.  I didn't want a hug or a, oh, my God, it's you. 
[00:40:30]  I saw this happen too because – let me just add a little to this.  When he was on our show, we felt like we were going to exchange numbers.  We all were bonding like you wouldn't believe.  Pals.  Pals, sure.  He gave us some unbelievable stuff that every sports columnist in America used.  And ESPN.  He was talking about steroids.  And his divorce.  And it was unbelievable stuff.  Yeah.  So go ahead, Jimmy.  So we see him at this thing.  And it was that night or a day later or something like that?  Yeah, or was it within a week, I believe.  It was within a week.  Very close.  And I see him. 
[00:41:00]  And I'm like, hey, man, how you doing?  And he's like, hey.  You're looking.  That's the end.  That's a period.  That's not a semicolon.  Like there was something after it.  He blew me off like all of a sudden.  It was his first day in AA and I was the last fat chick that brought him to his bottom.  I couldn't believe how horribly he blew me off.  And I think he didn't even know who he was.  Well, I said –  I thought –  I believe he just had no clue that he just admitted to all this stuff on our show a mere 
[00:41:30]  couple days earlier.  That would have been acceptable.  That would have been acceptable.  Because at least he doesn't remember you.  Okay, I'm just –  But how could he not remember us is what I'm saying.  Well, I said to him –  Because it wasn't like a typical interview.  It was such a blow off.  I actually went like – I don't know if you remember.  I would interview you.  He goes, oh, no, yeah.  I remember you.  How you doing?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was the worst non-conversation I ever had.  Did you just skulk away?  No, I slugged away.  I actually left a slug trail behind me. 
[00:42:00]  I was just a slug boy walking away with nothing.  Did you see it, Ope?  Did you see that?  The Lairds?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What was worse, that or my Leary blow off?  Oh, the Leary – they were very similar.  Very similar?  Yeah, that was hilarious.  The Leary blow off at Comics Come Home up there in Boston.  Oh, God.  One of the most embarrassing moments in my life.  Dennis Leary.  Well, we're dopes.  I mean, we do this very popular radio show, and we meet celebrities, and it goes very well  on our show to the point you really feel like the guys remember you and know you and want 
[00:42:30]  to hang out with you.  And Leary started doing our show, and by the way, this is old news.  We love Leary, and I think we're at a different position with him.  Oh, yeah.  We've talked to him about it.  He officially has acknowledged that we do exist past the radio show.  But at this point, he did not.  We only did the show with him a couple of times, maybe, and it was the fact that he  was on the show The Job with my buddy Adam Ferrara at the time.  So Adam said, hey, I'll introduce you to Leary in a little bit, and then he went off somewhere. 
[00:43:00]  I didn't see him, but then I see Leary at the bar, and there's an opening, and I'm  going to get a drink.  So I figured, you know something?  Let me just say, hey, I'm good friends with Adam Ferrara.  He's on your show The Job.  My name's Anthony.  I hope you're on Anthony's show.  Nice to meet you.  I'm thinking we're going to have this big conversation.  All you guys are watching me as I walk over there, and I use that line.  I open up with the whole Adam Ferrara thing.  He goes, yeah, how you doing?  And turns his back to me and just leans on the bar again.  And I get my beer, and I'm drinking my beer, and I turn around and walk away. 
[00:43:30]  And I went to look back at all my buddies, Opie and everybody.  You didn't set this up well.  You basically told everybody in our little circle, oh, I'm going to go say hi to Dennis  Leary.  So all eyes were watching Anthony walk over to Dennis Leary.  Well, that's why.  They were all watching.  And then he had a saunter back toward us.  I came back, and as I looked at all my buddies, they quickly looked away.  They didn't want to look at me.  They were so embarrassed for me.  They didn't even want to look at me.  Larry pretty much shook your hand without even looking at you. 
[00:44:00]  Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, how you doing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm like, but I'm Adam's friend.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's on your show.  Yeah.  It was so humiliating, they couldn't even tease you for it.  No, no.  They made like they didn't see it.  It was embarrassing.  All right, we've got to take a break.  So Tracy Morgan is in trouble today.  At least he's not two games under .500 with a $6 billion payroll, you dopes.  You dopey.  Well, the Rocket is showing up at the minors for a little training. 
[00:44:30]  I hope the Rocket throws his first pitch, and they say, that's a really weird way for  a ball to look.  There's a hand and arm attached to it.  And Steinbrenner still has to pay him.  You suck.  Jackasses.  Hey, we don't have Michael run the team.  Where's our Susan Wallman call?  Give me that for after the break.  Oh, I love her.  It's George Steinbrenner's box.  Screaming mad woman.  Roger Clemens is in George Steinbrenner's box.  This is amazing.  I'm looking in the dugout.  I see bats and gloves.  George Steinbrenner has brought Roger Clemens back. 
[00:45:00]  I think I got it in front of you.  I think that's it.  He sounds like Daffy Duck's speedball.  This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.  Is it?  Really?  Oh, she's the worst.  More amazing than Lou Garek saying what he did that day.  And John Steinbrenner's box.  You got it?  Ah.  Right next to me where?  Yeah, so why don't you stop humiliating him? 
[00:45:30]  Oh, my God.  It was right there and you didn't just point it out immediately.  It's the way he pointed it out with disdain.  It's right next to you.  It's right next to you.  I think he even said stupid.  Yeah.  Why don't you just smack the back of his head and point at it?  That head shake is my favorite.  I know.  The old scowl and head shake of E-Rock.  It's also the most exercise he gets.  We'll get into the E-Rock weight loss thing.  Sam laughs.  You know, I don't know.  Like, obviously the Red Sox and the Yankees, massive rivalry.  But I think if you're a fan of sports in general, like, for George Steinbrenner to bring Roger 
[00:46:00]  Clemens back in that way, like, just a complete surprise to everybody, is a really cool sports  moment.  Yeah.  You got to see past the fact that maybe you hate the Yankees and there's Boston going,  no, we don't.  No, we don't.  I know.  A big surprise.  Yeah.  But usually it's done at a boring press conference that you know ahead of time and there he is  with his Yankee cap on in front of the media.  It's like, it's a snooze fest.  But to all of a sudden be at a baseball game and they kind of, like, point up to George Steinbrenner  in his box and there's Roger Clemens hanging out and no one had a clue. 
[00:46:30]  That's a cool moment.  Yeah.  And this is coming from a Mets fan, by the way.  I'm not a Yankees fan.  All right.  I do not like the Yankees whatsoever.  I didn't like them way before the Derek Jeter incident with little Jimmy Norton.  But with that said, Susan Wallman just blew the moment because now it's all about what  she said instead of the actual how she said it.  Right, right.  Jesus, she lost her mind.  Thank you all.  Well, they came and got me out of Texas.  And I can tell you it's a privilege to be back. 
[00:47:00]  I'll be talking to you all soon.  And she's off.  Roger Clemens is in George's box and Roger Clemens is coming back.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, Roger Clemens standing right in George Steinbrenner's  box announcing he is back.  Is she from Boston? 
[00:47:30]  She has to be.  I've walked.  She's standing in George Steinbrenner's box.  George Steinbrenner's box.  Oh, my God.  She should have said, of all the dramatic things I've seen in my life, this doesn't crack the  top 200.  Right.  It's a millionaire in a box talking awkwardly to people.  I'll talk to you all soon.  That was the worst hello on her.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  Is this wicked or what?  Wicked pisser. 
[00:48:00]  And just stupid Clemens.  It's a privilege to be back, even though they offered me more money than Texas, but I left  anyway.  Stupid ass.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And George Steinbrenner's box.  Gracious, goodness gracious.  Right in George Steinbrenner's box.  Wow.  He is back.  Roger Clemens is a New York Yankee.  And there we go, John.  You don't have to worry about who's going to take that spot in the rotation.  You should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout. 
[00:48:30]  Big grin on Jorge Posada's face.  Maybe a big grin on Jorge Posada's face, because maybe, I don't know, maybe he was seeing  something else.  You got to play that part, because she says all the excitement in the Yankee dugout, if  you're driving, pull over.  She's going to describe the excitement in the Yankee dugout, and I just want you all to  just to relax.  It gets crazy.  What are you picturing?  Just the high five, the lunacy. 
[00:49:00]  High fiving.  Hats are flying into the stands.  The fans are going, the people are in the dugout just going nuts.  A-Rod is taking off his athletic supporter, and he's holding it over Posada's face to  revive him.  It's lunacy slash sexiness.  By the way, at the start of this break, see, we had no idea we were going down this road.  See?  This is the type of radio show we do.  Free wheeling.  So what else?  By the way, how long would it take for him to revive him in that fashion? 
[00:49:30]  Probably, well, it depends.  Maybe for a while, Posada would just fake not being revived.  That's what I'd do.  Oh, damn.  Wait, here's the excitement.  You have to be watching.  Oh, yeah, please.  Folks, the excitement.  This gets a little nutty.  The dugout.  Take that spot in the rotation.  The spot.  You should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout.  Big grin on Jorge Posada's face.  Andy Pettit knew.  Big size.  Roger Clemens is now a Yankee.  Attention fans.  He is here, and now we don't have to discuss who takes that place. 
[00:50:00]  Incidentally, the big smile on Posada's face was all the excitement.  She said Andy Pettit knew.  Yeah, yeah.  He knew.  So the dugout description of the dugout excitement was a grinning man.  Two people, one grinning, and one who knew.  So it's the same excitement you could see any Sunday morning while someone reads the funny  papers.  Someone's grinning.  She's talking about it like it's the Ted Offensive.  There's two guys. 
[00:50:30]  One grinning.  One is not surprised at all.  Oh, my God.  The law is now unwinnable.  God, is she an ass?  How many guys in the Yankees dugout going, so that's where my raise went?  Yeah.  The excitement.  Yeah, the excitement.  I don't think.  As they all call their agents.  They go, did you hear Roger Clemens is getting just under a million dollars to start?  Get on the phone with John Steinbrenner.  Oh, my God.  Goodness gracious. 
[00:51:00]  You should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Posada just took a sip of water.  Shut your mouth.  All right.  We got a break.  We're a little late.  We're a little late.  A little late.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:51:30]  Hey, good morning.  Hi.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Old Jimmy Norton.  Good evening.  Hope everybody had a pleasant Mother's Day.  Wow.  Did you see your mommy?  No, I called her and I left her a message and her and my dad had been out, so I have  to talk to her today, actually.  I gave my mommy a card that was meant for a, like, infant.  Oh, I did that one year.  Yeah.  I can mix that up.  It's like, thank you for singing me to sleep.  Mommy.  Mommy. 
[00:52:00]  And it's done in crayons or something?  Yeah, it's like, it had little sparkles on it.  I gave my mom one of those, like, a couple years ago, thinking it'd be really cool, bring  us back to a time.  Yeah.  And innocence.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  And she opened it up, she's like, what is this?  Oh, it's funny and cute.  I think she felt like I didn't care or something.  I'm like, no, see, I care too much.  Yeah.  Or going old school, like when I used to, like, do little drawings and crayons for you and  stuff, and how to spell mommy with the Y backwards and all that.  Of course.  Yeah.  Because I heard some people saying mean things about our mommies on the news. 
[00:52:30]  It's so funny when they get on our moms, and one woman's just looking right into the  camera saying, you know, do you have mothers?  Do you kiss your mothers with that mouth?  And then me and mom are joking, like, during Mother's Day dinner, we're kind of quoting  that line, and I go, yeah, open mouth.  And my mother laughs.  Me and my mom.  She's an animal, too.  Me and my mom don't joke like that. 
[00:53:00]  No.  No.  Oh, you should.  Yeah, it's fun.  Fun for everybody.  Me and my mom joke like, my mom's like, pass the turkey, and I'm like, I thought I was  the turkey.  And she goes, oh, cut it out.  Oh, go on.  But you're doing French kiss girls with mom.  You're a good boy.  It's full and good fun.  Then I'm driving home and gotten a little bit of a jam up.  What happened?  Well, it was a nice day yesterday, wasn't it?  Yeah.  So I have to drive many, many exits on the LIE, and it was a nice day, so I figured I'd 
[00:53:30]  take the old Shelby Mustang out.  Take the old Shelby Cobra GT out.  The old GT500 out on the road.  Hope it's paid for.  Yeah.  And took it out, went to mom's, had a great time driving back, a lot of traffic, so it's  a little frustrating.  You don't get to open it up a little bit.  I'm not talking about going crazy.  I just like, you know, I just want to drive fast.  Ain't so crazy.  It's not going crazy.  I'm not going to do 130 down the expressway, but you know, I want to get up to 80. 
[00:54:00]  I want to do 80.  It's safe if there's no cars, but there were cars, so I'm being a good boy, because  there's traffic.  I'm not going to, you know, weave in and out of traffic like a maniac, but, you know, I  was passing some people.  I get off the expressway by where I live.  That's all I'll say.  And there's a light, of course.  You get off an off-ramp, and at the top of the ramp, there's a light.  They haven't found out where you live yet?  No.  Some people probably know, but screw them.  So, I cross over the intersection. 
[00:54:30]  Now, I'm behind a minivan, and remember, I've been frustrated at this expressway.  It'll be in a lot of traffic.  There's no traffic on the service road except for this minivan who's now making a right turn  into a supermarket parking lot at a billionth of a mile an hour.  She's a soccer mom with probably...  You make the tag.  With probably little ones in the back seat watching their cartoons.  You make the turn. 
[00:55:00]  Let me see.  I'm being laughed at by police officers on my cell phone right here.  So, when the minivan clears me in front of me, I just goose it and dump the clutch, and  perhaps my wheels were spinning as I took off.  How fast did you get it on the service road?  I slammed second.  Well, that's part of the story.  All right.  And I dumped the clutch and spin my wheels again. 
[00:55:30]  I hit third, and I chirped the wheels.  And at this point, I am flying down the service road.  What does chirp the wheels mean, by the way?  That's, you know, you still get a little bit of rubber out of it.  They were completely spinning in first and second.  I want to ask Jimmy, do you chirp your wheels ever?  Sometimes I'll put my car up on blocks and just let the wheels spin quick.  And then kick the blocks out.  Yeah, and then you'll chirp.  Like smash into a wall.  Chirp.  But now I'm coming up on a light where I have to make a turn. 
[00:56:00]  So, I start slowing down.  Look at my rearview mirror, and I see the ever-familiar police car.  Lights aren't on, but I know it's a police car from my county.  Did he pull out or something from somewhere, or you passed him?  He must have.  All I can guess is he was in that supermarket parking lot that the minivan was pulling into.  Oh, okay.  And I, because he must have heard my wheels, saw me flying. 
[00:56:30]  And so, I'm waiting at this light, and he's right behind me.  And I look in my rearview, and I see him.  His head's going.  He's looking at my plate.  He's punching in numbers.  He's doing all kinds of stuff.  So, I know what's going down.  So, right when the light turns green, I instantly put my blinker on.  I pull into a school and give him plenty of room to pull behind me, turn the car off, roll the window down, do everything I do, pop the glove compartment open, make sure he sees my hands and everything. 
[00:57:00]  And he says, License Reggie, does the whole, goes through the whole drill.  Wait, he didn't put his lights on and you pulled over?  No.  That's hilarious.  Dude, I knew I was done.  I knew.  I knew I was done.  And apparently, I find out later, because I have a common friend in the precinct that had been spoken to, let's just leave it at that, that he thought I was going to run.  And he was ready to get on the radio at a highway because he assumed that I was going to run. 
[00:57:30]  And I said, Sir, the last thing I want is for me, especially, and I said, especially now, is for me to be on the news with a cop's knee to the back of my neck on the middle of the street.  Could you see that one?  Oh, yes.  Shock jock second mistake.  Shock jock shocking driving.  And they pan to me and him just laughing.  Yeah.  Exactly.  We would have to laugh.  We would have to laugh.  Of course we would.  So, yeah, I got in a little bit of a jam up there, but we talked things out. 
[00:58:00]  We talked things over, and everything was fine.  And I assured him that I shouldn't and shunned and be doing that again and pulled out and went home.  I was almost home.  But he told me when he came back from the car, he goes, how much horsepower is this?  And I said, 500.  And he goes, that's a lot.  He goes, you know, I was ready to radio a head highway.  I thought you were going to run me. 
[00:58:30]  I was like, what gave you the impression?  I didn't say this.  I thought this.  What gave you the impression that I was going to run?  What does he think?  I would never run in that car.  And what does he think this is?  California?  Yeah.  For the rest of the country, you got to understand, Long Island, you can't run anywhere.  You really can't.  There's nowhere to go.  You have two major highways.  The Long Island Expressway and Northern State Parkway.  Everything else is side streets, pretty much.  And you only have pretty much two ways off the island. 
[00:59:00]  You're not running anywhere.  Especially in that car.  Like, that car says, hello, there's no way anybody's not going to see it.  Right.  So I'd have been, I'm not running.  And I'm not running.  I don't do that, except maybe once in Manhattan.  And it wasn't really a run, because the cop wasn't in a car.  He was on foot.  He was on foot, and I was just trying to get through a light.  And he banged on the quarter panel of my truck.  And so you might have been on the sidewalk for a little while.  It happens.  I've never denied driving on the sidewalks when need be. 
[00:59:30]  But that's only when there's too much traffic, or a truck is backing into a loading dock.  I don't miss driving with you.  I'll be honest with you.  No one does.  No.  Ozzy Osbourne coming in at 8 o'clock.  Speaking of cops, did you guys hear the 911 call from Tony Soprano?  Wow.  We'll get into that.  La, la, la, la, la.  If you're going to talk about it, just let me know.  I'll leave.  You'll leave.  I do want to see the show.  Okay.  They're showing it on TV.  Every screen is showing it.  But all I've got to do is avoid it for a few hours, and I'll watch it later. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, good luck.  But I'll get out of the way.  Good luck.  All right, listen.  Cop calls 911 after eating pot brownies.  Have you heard this yet?  I saw the story.  The story did not hear the audio.  It's unbelievable.  Listen to this.  911, it's emergency.  Yeah, can you please send rescue to...  I think I'm having an overdose as soon as my wife.  Okay, you and your wife?  Yes.  Overdose of what?  Marijuana.  I don't know if it had something in it.  Okay.  Can you please send rescue?  Please come. 
[01:00:30]  Okay, we're on our way.  Do you guys have fever or anything?  No, I'm just...  I think we're dying.  Okay.  How much did you guys have?  I don't know.  We made brownies, and I think we're dead.  I really do.  Okay.  That is some weed, man.  Wow.  I think we're dead.  Yeah, he thinks they're overdosing on pot.  They're hallucinating.  It gets...  Wow, they must have ate a lot of them.  The cop, this guy?  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  Who made the brownies?  Him and his wife.  And then what?  Did he put pot in them?  Yeah, they made pot brownies.  Oh, hold on.  I thought he inadvertently ate pot brownies.  Right, Danny?  They made it themselves, right?  Danny's our pot expert.  Apparently, the story goes, he actually took the pot from evidence collection.  Oh, this is good.  And made the brownies with that pot, and he wasn't sure if it might have had something else  in it.  It had paraquat in it.  Remember paraquat?  Paraquat.  What is it? 
[01:01:30]  Might have had some PCP.  That was a big scare back when I was in high school, that the pot you were smoking might  have paraquat in it.  It's this pesticide that was used in Mexico, and they said that it would be in there, but  it was completely a big stunt to try to get kids to stop smoking pot.  Paraquat.  Paraquat.  Oh, I thought you were talking about two women standing together.  No, I said paraquat. 
[01:02:00]  It continues.  We're dead.  I really do.  Okay, how much did you put in the brownies?  I don't know.  Was it a bag?  Who made the brownies?  My wife and I did.  Cuba, come here.  Okay, get a hug.  Cuba, come here.  He means the country.  She's on the living room ground right now.  Is she breathing?  She's barely breathing.  Is she awake?  I think so.  Okay, can you look?  Pardon?  Can you look?  Yeah, I can feel her.  She's laying right down in front of me. 
[01:02:30]  Time is going by really, really, really, really slow.  Oh, this guy is so stoned and paranoid.  Wow.  He got the paranoid pot.  Wow.  Oh, that's bad.  He just sounds completely stoned.  The time is going really slow.  I think we're dead.  Wow.  Hey, come on.  Who hasn't been here?  Come on.  Who has not been here?  Dude, this is bad. 
[01:03:00]  I think there was some angel dust in this.  Get all paranoid.  I think I could fly, man.  I'm going to try.  Come on, this is bad, man.  Shut up.  Don't make fun of me.  Well, here's part two.  I got to ride my bike, man.  I just got to go out and ride my bicycle a little.  Here's part two.  Here's part two.  Do you guys do this on a regular basis?  No, this is the first time that we've ever done it.  And you've never done marijuana before?  Yeah, I have.  You have, and you've never had this reaction to it before?  No, ever. 
[01:03:30]  What's the score on the Red Wings game?  What?  What's the score on the Red Wings game?  I've got no clue.  I don't watch the Red Wings.  Oh, okay.  I just want to make sure this isn't some type of, like, hallucination that I'm having.  Oh, why?  What does the score say?  Uh, three to three.  When channel's it on?  Um, channel two.  Eight billion?  Uh, it's two to two.  Huh?  It's two to two.  Uh-oh.  Okay, your police tell your officers they just passed me. 
[01:04:00]  Okay, they just passed you?  Yeah.  Go outside and flag them down, okay?  Okay, my mother-in-law just got here, too.  Okay.  Okay.  Alrighty.  Alrighty.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  And she's a big monster.  That's not good advice.  Go outside and, you know, flag them down.  They just passed my house in a spaceship.  Right.  We're in a spaceship.  I just want to know if I'm hallucinating.  I see Godzilla outside.  Right.  Oh, wait, it's my mother-in-law.  That is horrible.  The guy is so stoned. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  He's got a bit of a buzz on.  Is the Red Wings score three to three?  No, it's two to two.  Oh, are they wearing dresses?  And are they decapitated?  I think I'm hallucinating.  Yeah, they're playing hockey with axes, because that's what I'm seeing.  Wow.  There you go.  How do you know he's a cop?  Have you got arrested?  Yeah, the accompanying news story said he was a cop.  I forget where.  I think it might have been in Michigan.  I can't quite remember.  It must be.  Yeah, sure.  Wow.  But who hasn't been there at one point in their pot-smoking career as a kid or whatever? 
[01:05:00]  You get that one where you're a little paranoid.  Anyway, I've told it.  I lost my mind on weed once.  I was sitting there, and I was watching an old movie called Grey Lady Down.  There's that submarine movie.  I think Chuck Heston was in it or something.  And the sub sunk, and they're sitting on the bottom waiting to be rescued.  And I'm smoking weed and sitting in the chair.  And all I could imagine is how horrible it would be to be in that submarine.  And I got to the point where I felt like I was in that submarine and felt all the terror 
[01:05:30]  that you would feel being in a sub stuck on the bottom of the ocean.  And I had to run in my bedroom and hide under the blankets and shake.  I was so scared.  I felt like the walls were just closing in on you.  Oh, dude, I was in that sub.  There was one time in high school.  Of course, it was in high school.  Yeah, it wasn't Friday night or anything, right, Danny?  Yeah, all right, I'm with you.  I thought it would be a good idea to smoke before class, of course. 
[01:06:00]  And I don't know where this weed had come from, but it got me higher than I'd ever been in my life.  And I was sitting there in first period class, whatever it was.  And I was so high that my body started to tangle and feel kind of weird.  And it tricked my brain into thinking that I had, let's just say, had an accident, right?  Oh, no.  Which one?  A wet accident?  No.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  The good kind.  So I was so paranoid that that had actually happened that I didn't want to move because I didn't want to stir things up. 
[01:06:30]  Exactly.  So I'm just sitting there just waiting for the bell to ring.  And it got so bad to the point where I actually thought that I smelled something.  And then the minute the bell rang, I just ran to the bathroom to check.  And, of course, there was nothing there.  Nothing happened.  Nice pause.  Wow, that is stoned.  That was so high.  All right, we got to take a break and catch up a little bit.  Ozzy Osbourne coming in at 8 o'clock.  And we got some other great things to get to the cow with two noses. 
[01:07:00]  Ugh.  Oh, just come on.  Well, it's human interest Monday.  Pull out the gun and just end it.  It's human interest Monday that we got to do these stories.  Well, at least a big hanky.  Big hanky.  And the mock school shooting is going to piss off a lot of people today.  Unbelievable.  We'll get into that next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, Nashville.  This is Jim Norton.  I'm going to be at Zanies. 
[01:07:30]  May 17, 18, 19.  You can get tickets through Ticketmaster or you can call Zanies.  Get in touch with the Opie and Anthony Show right now by phone 866-WOW-1-WOW or go to instant feedback online at Opie and Anthony. 
[01:08:00]  Opie and Anthony.com.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  XM2-WOW.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show? 
[01:08:30]  Hope you're having an all right Monday.  B-Rock, how's that diet going?  Oh, that's right.  Just started it this morning.  What?  What?  Started the diet this morning, according to the book.  Started on a Monday.  What did you do Friday, Saturday, Sunday?  Oh, my God.  You're already making excuses.  Oh, boy.  When was Dr. Ian Smith in?  Last Tuesday?  Wednesday?  You just do a pen down.  What's the matter, Hawk?  No, because I'm taking this seriously.  No, you're not. 
[01:09:00]  All right.  What's the bet?  Dr. Ian Smith was in what?  Last Tuesday?  Maybe Wednesday?  Huh?  Oh, Thursday, okay.  So, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.  So, he was in about four days ago, maybe five days ago, okay?  And the bet is simple.  If E-Rock loses 20 pounds?  20 pounds.  20 pounds by what?  June 28th.  By June 28th.  That's not a lot of days.  You already let four days go by, because you said you started your diet today.  If you lose the 20 pounds, the $500 that Dr. Ian Smith already handed to you, you get 
[01:09:30]  to keep.  If you do not lose the 20 pounds, you have to give the $500 back.  Plus 100.  Plus 100.  All right.  If it says start on a Monday, be it whatever, that's fine.  Couldn't you make believe?  Were you eating those sensibly in the past four days?  Oh, okay.  So, as long as you weren't, like, stuffing your face.  No, no, no.  All right.  Then that makes sense, then.  Because if the book says start Monday, then you've got to start on Monday. 
[01:10:00]  But, E-Rock, you're not smart.  Why can't you make believe Thursday's Monday?  Monday, is there a scheduling thing in there?  What?  Why does it matter to start on officially a Monday?  Because it's...  If you only have a...  You have a timer strain on yours.  The average person that picks up Dr. Ian Smith's book and it says start on a Monday,  they can go, I'll start on a Monday.  But you...  The days are already counting since the bet started.  Mm-hmm.  You're what?  How many days left? 
[01:10:30]  I don't know.  About two weeks.  Whatever.  But that's...  You know what it is, though?  It's...  I don't fault him as much because if the book says start Monday, he's got to start Monday.  As long as he was eating right, like, the other days, those four days, didn't, like...  You can't tack on pounds eating, like, crap for the four days and then start on Monday.  Like, when people go, I'm going to quit smoking on Monday, and then they just smoke, like,  80 cigarettes in a day.  Yeah.  Like, as long as he was eating sensibly, I don't see any problem in that. 
[01:11:00]  Well, he has a time limit, and he's not like most people.  He's obese.  Well, that's just it, though.  If, you know...  What did you eat at Caroline's over the weekend when you saw Jimmy?  I actually had the mixed green salad.  Oh, okay.  Very good.  Very good.  What did you eat yesterday?  Yesterday, we went out to dinner.  I had some red snapper without the flaky crust stuff on it, so it was just pure red snapper.  How about potatoes or any of that stuff?  Nope.  How about... 
[01:11:30]  Spinach and...  Good.  Yeah, that was about it.  Yeah, bread?  Dessert?  No bread.  No dessert?  No dessert.  I had berries.  I ate a lot of berries.  That's what the book says.  Ian and I discussed it when he was writing it.  We came to that conclusion.  Yeah.  That's good.  All right, so he did good.  Well, we got someone in the studio that...  So we got him?  That's heard differently there.  Oh, no, who heard differently?  We got him.  What a shock Sam heard differently.  I heard he had something else.  Oh, boy.  Here it comes, folks. 
[01:12:00]  Hold on.  Sam, what have you heard?  Now, remember, E-Rock decided to start the diet today, Monday.  But he was eating sensibly.  But he was eating sensibly since Dr. E.  Salad.  Laid down the bed.  And some snapper.  All right.  What did you hear, Sam?  There's rumors going around about what he had for dinner last night.  You went out to dinner.  Where'd you go?  A restaurant in Jersey called Benito's.  Oh, that's the one that is owned by who?  That's Lily the Intern's father, I think. 
[01:12:30]  Lily the Intern's father from the Ron Pez show.  Okay.  Yeah.  And maybe you got a little reconnaissance report.  Who was studying what E-Rock was eating yesterday?  I don't know.  There might have been somebody who noticed.  Oh, Jesus.  And, Sam, from what you heard, was it snapper with no breading on it and no bread and that's it?  No.  It was not.  No.  Okay.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Yes.  Before this comes out, would you like to maybe, I don't know, rethink what you had last night? 
[01:13:00]  Maybe it slipped your mind.  No.  Because I can probably tell you what this is.  Oh, okay.  All right.  He could probably tell us what this is.  Not knowing what this is yet.  I love it.  Dinner number two.  What a brilliant defense.  He's coming with a defense right off the bat.  He's swinging before any accusations that really hit him.  I like that.  I love this.  He knows Sam's got something on him, but it sounds like he can explain it. 
[01:13:30]  All right.  E-Rock.  All right.  What is Sam going to say?  I believe it's about the meal that I was supposed to have before I had the red snapper.  What do you mean you were supposed to have?  Is that right?  This is the first I've heard about red snapper.  I don't know.  All right.  Go ahead, Sam.  What have you heard?  The rumor is that for dinner last night, E-Rock started with a Caesar salad.  Very good.  Then had a steak.  And then finished with an unknown dessert. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, boy.  Caesar salad, a steak, and a dessert.  Did you have a Caesar salad?  That was the only salad that I could...  Caesar salad is not the most healthy.  No, no.  Hold on now.  If you don't eat the croutons...  No, no croutons.  No croutons.  You have dressing on the side?  No, they don't make it that way.  No croutons.  Marshmallows.  They don't make it that way?  They don't.  Every restaurant I go to, I go, dressing on the side.  Dressing comes glued to the salad, apparently. 
[01:14:30]  They grow it that way.  The lettuce.  I guess it's just a special lettuce that they grow in South America that comes with  the dressing already on it.  The dressing on it.  It's great.  What do you mean it comes that way?  That's how they...  They brought out this little wagon thing.  They dished.  Everybody's plate out, and that's how it was given to me.  See, this is why you will absolutely lose the bet, by the way.  Because your excuse is, it came that way, so I ate it that way.  Like, what if it came with Twinkies in it?  And E-Rock, I'm not trying to beat you.  I'm trying to give you some advice. 
[01:15:00]  Like, I try to eat healthy.  So if I'm at a restaurant and I want, like, the dressing on the side, which I usually do,  and they come out like that and it's already pre-made like that, you know what I'm saying?  No salad for me.  No salad for me.  That's right.  I'll eat something else.  Or you ask, do you have some maybe just plain lettuce leaves in the back?  Because I'm trying to, like, you know, win $500.  I want to know what the controversy is, though.  Now we have two different things here. 
[01:15:30]  We have the snapper.  Now, you didn't mention the Caesar salad before when we asked you what you had.  You just said the snapper.  And you plucked the croutons off the Caesar salad?  Yeah.  No croutons.  But plenty of dressing.  What's that?  He must have gotten dressing all over his hands.  My goddamn stamp.  All right.  So now the Caesar salad and the snapper.  Snapper, yes.  No dessert.  No dessert. 
[01:16:00]  Couldn't.  Couldn't.  Couldn't.  Why?  Why?  Because the person who's doing the diet with me was paying attention and said, you can't  have anything.  Your girl?  Yeah.  So where did this?  No, we had a huge party with us.  Uh-huh.  And there was a couple of kids sitting next to me.  There was a lot of food all over the place.  So it could have been like, oh, he had all this stuff in front of him, but I wasn't touching  it.  Oh, okay.  So you might have had the steak in front of you.  Did you try a piece of steak just for the hell of it? 
[01:16:30]  Well, here's what it was.  Yeah.  Well, now we have a, there's a big, don't say you mixed it up now.  One's a fish, one's a mammal.  No, I understand that.  I love, here's what it was.  Here's what it was.  I like the preface.  All right.  That is good.  Here's what it was.  That was a giant land fish.  Yeah, yeah.  Having talked to Jim on Friday, he was talking about, she'd start eating something called  wild salmon.  So I started to, I wanted to try it this weekend.  They didn't have any salmon.  Everything else on the menu looks very good, but it was not anywhere near what I could do with 
[01:17:00]  this diet.  So I figured I'll just get the steak.  It'd be simple.  Uh-huh.  Steak wasn't cooked right.  I didn't want to send it back.  Somebody next to me who was trying to get the salmon, couldn't have it either, had the  snapper, didn't like it.  I had the snapper that they had.  When you ordered the steak.  Yeah.  And how did you know that the steak, how did you know that the steak wasn't right?  Because it was supposed to be somewhat pink and it was very, very gray.  It was supposed to have ice cream on it.  Did you?  So Sam, by the way, came back with a report and Eric said, I know what this is. 
[01:17:30]  Yes.  Accurate.  See, this is why you will lose the bet.  The Caesar salad came with the dressing.  So you said, ah, it came like this.  I got to eat this way instead of saying, no, thank you, none for me.  And then you actually did order the steak.  You ordered the steak.  What's the confusion with the dessert?  Yeah, what's the dessert?  Yeah, now the dessert.  Because the reports are you did have a dessert.  I didn't have a dessert, no.  Did you order a dessert?  I had a coffee, a cappuccino.  But did you, a cappuccino. 
[01:18:00]  Those, by the way, are loaded, but.  No, listen, how many sugars?  No sugar.  Oh.  It's a cappuccino.  Half and half?  No.  Dream?  Just how it came with.  Hey, Lily's on the line, whose father owns the restaurant.  The lovely Lily.  And, Iraq, it just says in comments, because, you know.  Oh, my God.  It says, soft, fat Eric eating steak.  All right, let's say hi to Lily.  Lily.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Lily.  Eric did, in fact, have the steak, because he told me he had it. 
[01:18:30]  So, she's lying.  No, I did tell her that, because it wasn't cooked right.  But also, there was somebody else in our party that had the red snapper, who didn't want  the red snapper, so I had the red snapper.  Right.  Well, Eric told me that his steak wasn't cooked right, and so then I was bitching at the waiter,  and I said, you know, that's not right.  Eric's my friend.  You should have cooked it right.  And then the waiter came back and was like, if it was cooked bad, why do you eat the entire  thing?  Oh, no.  Eric.  It was shared. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, wait.  Oh, okay.  Now it was shared.  I love this guy.  Now it was shared.  All right.  So, now you're admitting that you had some of the steak.  You had some of the steak.  Oh, my God.  This is someone else in the party that was sitting next to you.  This is pure brilliance, man.  This is just amazing.  Where was, according to you a minute ago, what did you have?  I sucked in some air and ate some fat-free fish, and someone gave me a leaf, and I ate  half.  I was full.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Now we have an admittance that you shared the steak, right? 
[01:19:30]  Yes.  And ate the snapper.  And look at, look at, he's, he has lowered his whole body.  All right.  That is a pantomime.  How many pantomimes do you have, Eric?  I couldn't eat it.  Oh, Jesus.  I did not have, oh, God, no.  Well, we have noticed that Iraq has to chug water when he feels uncomfortable.  The shared thing is, so you shared it with somebody.  Yes.  That's what you're saying. 
[01:20:00]  All right.  So, now you had a Caesar salad with dressing on it, and you had some of the steak, and  all of the red snapper?  Almost all of it, yeah.  Okay.  Now, Lily, do you know anything about dessert?  Um, I'm not sure, but I did see a lot of dessert at the table, and there was, you know, chocolate  cake, all that stuff.  So, I'm sure he added some, some bites of it.  He might have had a bite of it.  All right, Iraq, considering you're starting the diet today, you must have had a couple  bites of dessert.  Wait, what did you have a bite of?  Yeah, what did you have a bite of?  Why wouldn't you, if you had, if you had some steak, which you knew wasn't good, and you 
[01:20:30]  had, like, a Caesar salad with all kinds of dressing, which you knew wasn't good, then  you ate the snapper, which is good, but after the steak, it really doesn't matter.  Why wouldn't you, then, just at least have a bite of one of the desserts?  Come on.  Because, one, I don't like chocolate, and two, I usually don't eat any desserts.  Like, I'm not a cake person.  You ate something that swam, something that walked.  Did you have anything that flew?  Did you have any dessert?  No.  Not a bite?  No.  Not even a taste of someone else's anything?  Not even tasting. 
[01:21:00]  How did you forget the steak, though?  Yeah, you forgot half the steak.  You said you had half of the steak.  You didn't really eat it.  What's that?  I didn't have half the steak.  No?  I just didn't want to send it back, so some other people that were sitting next to me  also had the steak.  I had a little bit of it, but I didn't eat the whole steak.  I had the red snapper instead.  Anything else there, Lily?  I don't know about that.  The waiter did say that he did clean his plate. 
[01:21:30]  Eric is not disgusted and turning around and getting very, very annoyed.  Yeah, he is so annoyed right now.  He is hot under the collar.  Wow.  All right.  All right.  And this is the first official day of the diet there as he slugs more liquids.  What are you having for breakfast this morning?  You have to eat in the morning.  I already have breakfast.  What did you have?  I had two egg whites and an apple.  Cool.  All right, Lily, thank you.  That'll turn into half an elk.  All right, there goes Lily. 
[01:22:00]  Thank you, Lily.  Bye, Lily.  We have spies everywhere.  You're Lily on the Ron and Fez show.  Yes, of course.  She does a great job.  She's that hot chick that runs around the Ron and Fez studio?  That everyone wants to, yeah.  Oh, she's lovely.  So there you go, E-Rock.  Yeah.  To kiss her fart.  E-Rock.  You can't just say, I ate the Caesar salad because the dressing was on it, so I had no choice.  You've got to make sacrifices.  Sure do.  You're going to lose this bet.  Yeah.  See, I secretly want E-Rock to win this bet.  I really do.  But I'm losing confidence already. 
[01:22:30]  Because that was only one meal.  See, if I was entering into this bet, I wouldn't wait until Monday to start the official diet.  No.  I would have been just fasting, basically, over the weekend.  These guys are just like...  Sam's crying.  He's laughing so hard.  Yeah.  That happens to me.  It's really uncomfortable.  And one of the best parts, and unfortunately, this isn't television, is when Sam comes over 
[01:23:00]  to the mic, he lifts his BlackBerry up, and he's reading this off of there like he's  getting intelligence reports.  Yeah, I'm spot.  Like it wasn't something that he just came in with.  It's actually documented.  I'm trying to be accurate.  Right.  Of course.  I'm making it up.  Of course.  I order a lot of fish.  How was it prepared?  Originally, it was supposed to be prepared in some kind of...  Like a flaky crust with some kind of nut garnishing on it.  Yeah. 
[01:23:30]  And how was it prepared?  It was no sauce on the plate, or oil on the plate, and no crust on it.  Just a piece of fish.  Like Fred Flintstone gets.  Yeah.  Just a fish on a plate.  Fish with the head and the tail and everything, right?  Just kidding.  All right, E-Rock.  Good luck.  All right.  Good luck to you on that.  Oh, as he just pushes the mic away in disgust.  How many days, Scott?  Unfortunately, it wasn't a fattening Caesar salad he would push the mic away.  It's a calorie-less microphone. 
[01:24:00]  And here's another mistake that you did wrong, E-Rock.  Uh-oh.  More.  Why would you go to a restaurant where we could keep tabs on you?  That's true.  I didn't have a choice in it.  Oh.  Why?  There's a million restaurants in the New York area.  He means they give him a discount.  And he had to go there.  Wait.  Why did you have no choice?  Seriously.  I didn't book this.  I had to go as part of a family event, and I had no idea that that was the restaurant.  So they book a restaurant that is associated with the Ron and Fez show?  They go there all the time.  Knowing that we're going to have spies there? 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, but why don't you say, you know what?  You know, the guys are riding me pretty hard.  Why don't we try to find a restaurant where no one's going to know me?  Right.  Yeah.  A party of 15.  You know what?  I really can't go there because of this diet thing I'm doing on the radio.  All right.  But who booked the restaurant?  Her family.  Your girlfriend?  Yeah.  You couldn't talk your girlfriend into going somewhere else?  I had no idea.  I showed up there, and all of a sudden, I see Lily in the front there.  I had no idea that was her father's place.  Why did she? 
[01:25:00]  God, if I saw Lily and I'm E-Rock, I'm eating breadsticks and drinking water.  Best behavior.  Wait.  Why is your girl on the diet?  She's in good shape.  She's a lovely figure.  I'm trying to help him out.  I know.  Figuring if she does it, he'll do it.  Power of two.  Yeah.  Is that what it is?  She's trying to help you out?  She wants to lose a little, too.  She doesn't need to, though.  I don't think she does.  E-Rock, this question coming in.  Who was the responsible person that ordered the snapper?  Somebody's mother.  Somebody's mother.  Okay.  And then they didn't like it. 
[01:25:30]  No, because they wanted the salmon as well.  So they were talked into getting the snapper.  Now, why did they order the snapper in this weird fashion that wasn't like the menu said?  It was like somebody that was on a diet would order it.  Or it usually just eats healthy.  So I was trying to follow what they were doing.  So this person that ordered the snapper also eats healthy?  I assume so.  And ordered it, like, devoid of any coverings or sauces.  Yeah, the first one.  That's lucky. 
[01:26:00]  Wouldn't you think that's, like, coincidentally lucky that that happened to be there when you got a steak that you didn't want and then ordered this and it just happened to be on the table, this remarkably healthy piece of fish?  I'm just saying.  It seems like an awful coincidence.  No, when they got it, it comes in a plate with some kind of, like, I don't know if it's a cream or an oil thing around the fish.  Oh, so there was sauce on the plate.  No, they sent it back because they didn't want it.  There's two people at the table.  Oh, so they didn't just say, well, it's a cream like that. 
[01:26:30]  What a nudge table.  Wait, they actually sent something back to get healthier as opposed to going, here it is, I'll have it.  See?  A nudge table.  Yeah.  Sending everything back.  I don't like this.  This is not cooked properly.  I don't like the steak.  Yeah, there was.  That's exactly why I didn't send the steak back because there was a couple other meals going back.  I'm like, you know what?  I'll eat it.  I'm just not going to eat it.  Thanks, Jim.  Well, the days are counting.  Wow.  He's got a time limit. 
[01:27:00]  That's sticking right along.  All right.  Well, there you go.  There's your EROC update.  Diet update.  Dr. Ian Smith did this, not us.  He gave you the $500.  Where is that $500?  Did you spend it?  No, it's locked up.  Locked up where?  In a safety deposit box.  Come on.  No, it's not.  What are you, a game show?  It's someone who will never find it.  See, they hung it on the treadmill.  It's in the lettuce drawer of his refrigerator.  The crisper.  Yeah, the crisper.  It's in the crisper. 
[01:27:30]  In the crisper.  Oh, brother.  It's locked up.  Are you kidding me?  Nope.  It's in an envelope, dated, and locked up.  Not spent.  All right.  He has no faith in winning.  Had to give the key to someone else.  Yeah, I would have spent that money on the way home.  Yeah.  They just lost the weight.  All right.  Here we go.  We've got to take a break.  Ozzy?  Ozzy here yet?  No?  Could be soon.  All right.  Ozzy Osbourne on the show in a few minutes here.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hear what everyone else is talking about. 
[01:28:00]  O&A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio,  starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  It's Opie and Anthony.  All my life I'm feeling over the top.  I don't know what I'm doing.  All I know is I don't want to stop.  All fired up, I'm going to go till I drop.  No, Ozzy, you're in the way.  Don't make me.  I don't want to stop. 
[01:28:30]  Hey, that's pretty cool.  Yeah, I love it.  That's Ozzy's latest song, I Don't Want to Stop, from Black Rain,  is the name of the CD.  Ozzy will be here any moment.  Any moment, we'll be talking to Ozzy Osbourne.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  I forgot he was coming in today.  I'm really, I'm kind of happy.  Oh, sure, you forgot.  Dude, I tossed and turned like just a nerd last night.  Little kid on Christmas morning.  I might have got an hour of sleep.  I might have.  Really?  That was awful.  It was awful.  What were you, what makes you so nervous? 
[01:29:00]  We've had him on the show before.  It wasn't nervous like in a, like a, oh my God way.  Just like a kind of like a, thank you for a fun day.  Yeah.  Ozzy.  All right, listen, before we get into Ozzy Osbourne, here's a quickie, a lot of people  talking about this today.  School stage a mock gun attack to teach students.  Did they inform everybody?  I don't know.  I don't know the details.  Was it a surprise or something?  We're going to learn as we go along here.  All right.  I know this much.  It wasn't out of college.  No?  I would think out of college, maybe you're in, I don't know. 
[01:29:30]  I think, I guess what I'm trying to say is that these are younger students.  Oh, okay.  Well, it was supposed to be a learning experience for sixth grade students in Tennessee.  Sixth graders?  Sixth graders?  Yikes.  But many parents are not laughing.  Teachers at an elementary school staged a mock gun attack on students during a weekend  class trips.  Now, many of the students were shaken up by the news and hid under tables.  Afterwards, the students and staff talked about what they would have done in a real situation. 
[01:30:00]  Parents say it was just too much after the Virginia Tech Massacre.  The school principal says the situation involved poor judgment.  Yeah.  So the kids didn't know?  Didn't know.  Oh, okay.  That's really creepy.  Isn't that...  Why would you do that?  So there's a lot of outrage there in Tennessee.  It's a sixth grade class mock gun attack.  Like when you do a fire drill, even then you know it's a fire drill. 
[01:30:30]  Right, right, right.  Like with the kids all scared about school shootings, you maybe should inform them, all  right, we're going to do a school shooting drill.  Yeah.  Let them know.  You don't just gather crap at them.  I think that's something you have to do ahead of time.  Wow.  So the kids are just running around freaking out and hiding?  Mm-hmm.  Who thinks this up and thinks it's a good idea?  What, this show?  That's what I was talking about, the show.  Of course. 
[01:31:00]  So...  Wow.  That's just unbelievable.  Yeah, that seems a little, uh, like it wasn't thought through very well.  Like didn't one person say like, hey, um, you know, we'll probably get in trouble for  this.  You can...  Again, the show.  You could get the same job done if you told them ahead of time.  Yeah.  We all had drills during school.  If this happens, this is what we're going to do.  Let's practice.  Right.  Blah, blah, blah.  But back then it was because of nukes. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  Like your desk was, you know, the old gag, like your desk was going to protect you from  nukes.  Yeah, okay.  The rooshkies were after us, so we had to hide under desks.  But as far as a school shooting, to actually tell them ahead of time and go, look, if you're,  you know, kid, you know, someone's coming into your classroom with a gun, this is something  we think might help you out a little bit.  You know, but to actually do it and see how people react, of course you're going to just  be out of your mind, screaming and yelling and running like crazy.  I think probably the best thing to tell anybody, but it's such a hard thing, and we've talked 
[01:32:00]  about it before, if there's ever a school shooting, is to just for everyone to rush  the guy, you know?  I mean, it's one of those hero moves, and who the hell's going to be like the first  line of people that do it?  But it really kind of does resolve the problem, you know?  If everybody just kind of rushes the guy, instead of, you know, the guy going around and  individually shooting people as they're trying to hide or run, you know, maybe train people  like that. 
[01:32:30]  You're never going to get to train people to rush a gunman at the same time.  Are you crazy?  But think about airplanes, like the whole situation with airplanes.  It used to be if a hijacker hijacked an airplane, people would sit in their seats and hope that  they'd land the plane and they'd get out.  After 9-11...  They understand that there's a different result.  Right.  Now you know that you do rush the guy, because the only other ending in this is you dying anyway.  So maybe that is the best idea. 
[01:33:00]  Human nature says run.  I know, yeah.  You're trying to tell me a gunman comes to the school and you're going to actually be  able to train everybody to rush him.  No way.  Sorry to say, but...  It's a tough one, but I don't know.  I mean, now...  It seems like if you've got a room full of people...  But now any...  I mean, you make a point, because any shenanigans on a plane, I mean, all hell breaks loose.  People love beating people up on planes, doesn't matter what it is.  Guy's complaining about his lunch, and he just gets wrestled to the ground and zip-stripped.  Noah, how many times have you been on a plane since, and you watch that person walking to 
[01:33:30]  the front of the plane to go to the bathroom, and you're just staring, staring.  You've got to eye him.  Okay, he took a left into the bathroom.  You've got to eyeball him.  Yeah.  See if he's checking the cockpit door.  Oh, man.  Just freaking nervous.  Imagine just someone making a mistake and thinking the cockpit door is the bathroom and  touching that knob.  You would just be...  Everyone up.  Boom.  In that case, I agree with you.  Everyone's up.  I guess, too, also, there's no escape from the plane.  Right, right.  Pretty much locked in there in a school situation, you think maybe out a window or down a hallway 
[01:34:00]  or just kind of leave.  You could leave the premises.  You can't leave the plane, so maybe that's why.  All right.  Another school story.  Yeah.  You got some?  No.  Okay.  Another school story.  Listen to what this swim coach did.  Uh-oh.  Well, we're learning more tonight about a former Tampa Prep swim coach accused of videotaping  high school students changing clothes. 
[01:34:30]  As Tampa Bay State News reporter Mike Deason explains, at least one victim says she posed  for explicit nude pictures, and parents believe the school didn't do enough to protect their  kids.  The picture police paint of Kim Brabson is that the former swimming coach agreed to  remove tardies or zeros from girls' school records if they'd remove their clothes and  change into a swimsuit while he allegedly secretly taped them.  I'm really mad.  I'm really upset.  Oh, my God.  What is wrong?  Who the hell thinks they're getting away with this stuff? 
[01:35:00]  And how do you break that to a girl?  Like, what if she says no?  How do you play that off?  Yeah.  I was only joking.  I was only joking.  I was only joking.  I was only joking.  I was only joking.  I'm really mad.  I'm really upset.  Tom Carey is a parent of two of the victims.  He's suing Tampa Prep.  It's far worse than I had ever imagined. 
[01:35:30]  Parents and students had to look at pictures and put a heartbreaking, that's my daughter  or that's me on them.  One student burst into tears and said, oh, God, Mommy, it's me.  That's my scar.  There appears to be several victims, but most swimmers say they were shocked by the incident.  Very close with Brabson and never expected any of it to happen.  Did he ever ask you to change?  No, absolutely not.  I was never approached.  So some of the kids actually did this to get their tardiness removed, and they only 
[01:36:00]  were bothered when they realized it was videotaped.  Maybe he said, go change in there.  I want to see you in a swimsuit, and I realize they're being taped naked.  You might stand there with a camera.  Okay.  All right.  Why don't they explain these things better?  I'm only guessing.  I don't know.  It sucks.  That's how I would have done it.  Now I'm confused because I read this differently that he wanted them to change in front of him.  Maybe.  Okay.  I don't know, though, Jimmy.  You might be right.  And then the camera was rolling somewhere hidden.  Somewhere else.  So it wasn't good enough that he saw this live.  He needed a real good memory of it. 
[01:36:30]  A little videotape.  How did it get out?  What finally happened?  Well, we got more on the story.  Let's see if it...  How did it not get out?  He was selling best-of DVDs at the school.  Exactly.  Make sale.  How does it get out?  It gets out because you can't keep it to yourself.  We've also learned that when the police confiscated Brabson's computer, they found a note from  headmaster Gordon McLeod saying, Kim, please remove all pictures of girls from this computer.  Thanks, Gordon.  The school's position is that it was conducting its own internal investigation and that that 
[01:37:00]  memo was written just a couple of days beforehand when McLeod saw some pictures of girls on  Brabson's computer who weren't Tampa Prep students but were inappropriate to be on a  school computer.  It's apparent that the dean had actual...  Tub girl.  ...about these photographs.  And now we've learned a student testified Brabson convinced her to send nude pictures of  herself to his friend and a former roommate.  That's totally outrageous.  I mean, we're talking about minor girls here.  And while the state will try to prove Brabson is guilty of a felony, Kerry will try to prove 
[01:37:30]  Tampa Prep didn't take all precautions it could have.  Now, Tampa Prep officials say there was no way the school could have known about Brabson's  alleged illegal activity or prevented it.  Hmm.  Jesus.  What the hell is he thinking?  I don't know.  You're not getting away with something like that.  Yeah.  Just not.  Just makes you wonder how many teachers got away with stuff before the internet.  I don't know. 
[01:38:00]  Like Jim said, what happens?  No, I'm not doing that.  Okay, I have to kill you.  Like, what do you do?  Because they're going to go home and tell.  Yeah.  Hey, look, you're a little late.  No, I know.  You want me to take that off, would you?  All right, just pose naked.  No.  No, no, what I'm trying to say is that it's okay.  By naked, I meant go home and forget this.  Yes.  I meant let's keep this under our hats.  All right, let's say hi to Drew in Pittsburgh.  Drew, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Hey, I love you guys.  Love the show.  Yeah, thanks. 
[01:38:30]  How you were saying before about school drills, my school actually had a drill,  like that.  We had code yellow, code green, code red.  And what they'd do is if we'd go to code yellow, we'd actually lock our doors, shut  off all the lights and hide in the back of the room.  And then at a certain time, they would alert our room and then we would sneak out quietly  to get outside.  Hmm.  And that's how you handled the school shooting situation?  Yeah, that's basically how they handled it.  If they'd shut the doors, lock them and shut off the lights and try to pretend it no one 
[01:39:00]  was in the room.  See, that works good if he's not in the room with you.  Like, if a shooter is in the room with you, then what?  You shut the door, lock it, shut the lights and go, uh-oh, we made a mistake.  You've got to kind of have another kind of defense against that.  And that's why I'm saying at that point, everyone's got to think, you've got to rush the guy. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, got to rush him.  Who's going to be the first guy, though?  You've got to all do it at once.  Yeah.  Crazy 88 style.  Well, you're going to be the brave one.  You run toward the gunman and you turn around and realize that no one's behind you.  Yeah.  Then what?  Say you were joking?  Yeah.  Because he can't be, unless he's got his back to the wall, I would think the best thing  is whoever's ever kind of on the sides or behind him, you go first.  Tackle him.  All right, Drew, thank you. 
[01:40:00]  All right, see you later.  All right, bye-bye.  Where's Ozzy?  I'm sure he's on his way.  He might hit a little traffic.  Nothing worse than in those movies when someone does that.  What happened?  He's coming.  He's late.  A few blocks away.  A few blocks away?  Okay.  Nothing worse than when you're watching a movie and someone's like, I got him, I got him,  I got him.  Come on, help, help.  And no one comes to help.  No, they all just look the other way.  That's awful.  And star whistling.  Scene in, what was that, Saving Private Ryan?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What happened?  Where that dopey corporal is down the stairs and Adam Goldberg is upstairs with a big 
[01:40:30]  Nazi with a knife?  Oh, yeah.  And he's just like, shh, shh, shh.  As he slowly puts the knife in his chest.  And the stupid corporals just sit down and stand on the stairs.  Wait, he didn't help him?  No.  Why?  Because he was a coward.  And then after the Nazi killed him, he kind of wipes the blood off his knife, walks down  the stairs, walks right past the corporal, and just kind of looks at him and keeps walking.  Wait, was the Nazi, I don't remember, I remember the scene. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, it's the most horrific scene in the movie.  I think worse than the beginning where they say all the, you know, the Normandy beach landings.  It's the worst scene in the movie.  They're fighting in a room?  Yeah.  They're fighting in a room.  They're really beating the crap at each other.  I mean, it's a fight to the death.  And this big Nazi gets his bayonet knife out and puts it against Adam Goldberg's chest  and starts pushing, and he's trying to push back, but he doesn't have enough power, and  the Nazi starts, like, whispering things to him in German and saying, shh, shh, as he 
[01:41:30]  slowly sticks it into his heart and kills him.  Could the corporal have just pulled out a gun and shot the Nazi?  The corporal could have done anything.  He could have beat him over the head with it.  Yeah.  He was standing on the stairs right below the room just listening to all this happen.  He was supposed to bring ammo.  At first, there were two guys up there, and he was supposed to bring them the ammo to,  you know, kill everybody, but he just didn't do it.  He just froze.  And then the way that Nazi just walked down the stairs and looked at him like, I don't  even have to kill this guy.  He's not even a threat, and walked right past him. 
[01:42:00]  That was it.  Corporal sounds like he knew what he was doing.  I guess so.  Take care, Nazi.  God bless.  God bless.  For help's sake.  Take a tizzy, sir.  Let's go to Jersey and say hi to Chris.  That was horrible.  Chris, what's going on?  What's going on?  I just had a quick comment about this.  Someone is suggesting that you should run Serpentine.  That does work, by the way.  If you do a little Serpentine.  Like Serpentine.  When you're getting shot at, you should do the Serpentine.  Absolutely.  That works.  What's up, Steve?  I'm here.  Ozzy's here. 
[01:42:30]  I just wanted to say, these drills don't really make much sense, because ones that shoot  up the schools or the students, they're going to be part of the drill.  Then they're going to know where they hide, where they're going to go, the whole plan.  That's true.  It'll help their body count.  Yeah.  That's true.  We're a little distracted, because Ozzy has entered the studio.  Thank you, Chris.  No one heard a word you said, sir.  Ozzy walked in.  We all just stared at Ozzy.  Yeah.  Stop your babbling, caller.  Ozzy's here.  What's going on, Ozzy?  How you doing?  Good.  God damn, you look good.  And you smell good again.  You always smell good. 
[01:43:00]  I always try and be, turn out, turn out, you know, a nice guy.  Yeah.  I'll come out in here smelling a puke and excrement from last week.  He's sleeping in his own, in his own sick.  I can smell you from here, and I'm like 20 feet away from you.  Good stuff.  Every time he comes in, he smells great.  It's got to be a cologne that you could, I don't know.  It's exclusive to just, I don't know, Ozzy.  It's Ozzy's Satanic.  Available now.  Yeah, he got his nails done. 
[01:43:30]  Do you pick your cologne out, or does Sharon just kind of leave it out and say, here, put this on?  It's something that I've been doing for a lot of years.  He's from England.  You could only get it from there.  Really?  It's a hell of a drive to get a drive.  A hell of a drive.  I keep just going off a pier and having to swim back.  I saw you, last time I saw you, I actually flew home from Aspen.  I was at a comedy festival to see you and Sabbath inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at the Waldorf.  No, we didn't hear the end of it from him. 
[01:44:00]  Jesus Christ.  He's still talking about it.  I was screaming about it for years, how it should have happened many years ago.  What were your feelings, actually, when they finally said you guys were in?  Well, you know, when they, I mean, we've been on the shortlist for every year, you know,  and so I kind of got pissed off with it now, because...  Well, you were seeing other bands get in before you.  Yeah, I didn't, whether they want to, I mean, this fucking thing.  Adjust Ozzy's mic, Steve. 
[01:44:30]  I know, you're bothering Ozzy.  Jesus, you're flipping it around.  Yeah, leave Ozzy alone.  He'll figure it out.  He knows how to work a microphone.  I kind of got pissed off at it because of the fact that it wasn't, it wasn't voltage in by the fans.  It was like a board of business guys, you know.  Yeah, what do they know?  And so I wasn't really interested in that, and then I come to the realization, now, it's not just for me, it's for the rest of the guys.  So, you know, they wanted it, and I'm glad I got it, you know. 
[01:45:00]  But I still think it should be done by a selection of the public.  Well, they're the same people that vote for that, like, the same pseudo-hipsters that kind of write for Rolling Stone and all these other stupid magazines that think the talking heads were the be-all, end-all of music.  That's got to be kind of irritating.  It's, um, there used to be a DJ like that in England, and he would have just junk bands on, but because it was him that was starting to plug in these bands, that would get success, and I'd go, what the fuck's up, what is it, what is it with them bands, you know? 
[01:45:30]  Just, just because he was like the guy, he was the guy that broke bands.  Yeah, I mean, but, um.  Critics do that, too, yeah, if certain critics says a band's good, then all of a sudden they're.  Back in the Sabbath days, we didn't like getting good reviews, because we didn't know, I mean, we'd get things, they'd say, oh, when I did so-and-so-so on the show, they used to write, they used to write the review before they went out, you know.  Mm-hmm.  Well, like, I went and saw the induction, and have you seen, like, the guys, like Tony Gieser, Bill, have you guys all been together since then, or no? 
[01:46:00]  No, I mean, they're out with Dale right now, I mean, I mean, uh, people keep asking me about doing another studio album with them, and we have tried.  But the, the problem being, is that, uh, it's a really, uh, I mean, we've all gone so many miles in different ways since the early days.  I mean, it would be the easiest thing in the world for us, the four of us, to do, go in the studio and make an album. 
[01:46:30]  Um, but, it's, um, my opinion is, to, to be able to have any, any, uh, so-so-so's, it's gotta be better, or if not as good as where we left off.  Well, I just haven't felt it, but, uh, I, um, I'd like to, before, uh, at the end of the day comes, just to finish off where I started.  Well, the two, you guys did two songs, uh, off Reunion, which, which were new ones, uh, uh, uh, uh, Psycho Man, Sam, I saw, they're both great songs, man.  They had, like, an old vibe to them, but they sounded updated. 
[01:47:00]  They didn't sound like you were just redoing the same stuff.  But, but, but, but, people, people now compare me against them, it's kind of, I mean, I was a singer with him for, from the restart.  I mean, Ronnie's a good singer.  I mean, I, I mean, everybody thinks, well, we'll, we'll say something, what do you think about Dio going out at restart?  I don't know, I, I don't own anybody, you know?  I don't, I don't expect anybody to sit around on, on, on, on their ass waiting for me to finish what I gotta do.  I like Dio, um, I went and saw Heaven and Hell when they were in there, they were very good, but it's like watching Ronnie on stage. 
[01:47:30]  It's like, it just makes, I said to the guy I was with, it just makes you love Ozzy more on stage, because it's, it's just like, there's something you do on stage, which is different than anybody else.  Yeah, but the thing is, I've, I've, I've, I've, I've never seen him perform, um, but I'll tell you what, there's a lot of guys trying to rip his style of singing off.  Over the years, yeah.  And he's got, he's got an amazing voice.  Powerful, yeah, voice going, but he's a short little guy, isn't he, Ozzy?  He's tiny.  Oh, is he a tiny little man? 
[01:48:00]  He's a midget.  That was one of the funniest lines ever.  Somebody asked Ozzy, because he used to hang a midget, uh, back in the days, uh, during Goodbye to Romance, they would string a midget up.  It was this beautiful love song, and they're just, a midget is being strung up by the neck.  And somebody said to him about bringing a midget, and he goes, well, Sabbath did that first, and they put Ronnie Dio on stage.  Oh, which is just...  I mean, I was talking about that, I think it was Virginia or something back in the day, and this cop comes in, he's got the visor, the mice, the bullets, the clubs, and everything. 
[01:48:30]  And he goes, comes in the dressing room, and he goes, which one do you use Ozzy Bond?  Oh, I don't know, me, I think.  Well, of course, Ron, and he goes, do you hang one of those little guys every night?  And I go, well, yeah.  He goes, well, where did you get them all from?  And I go...  Where did you get them all?  I have pictures of this truck with a lot of little people in the green.  You just pick one out.  Thank you.  It's your night tonight. 
[01:49:00]  Just blindly reach in and grab one of the little freaks and yank him out.  You're an animal on stage.  That's the beauty of Ozzy.  It's like people watch you on stage and are just amazed.  I mean, it's just, you've never seen anybody throwing water on people.  Oh, don't you do that anymore.  Why'd you stop that?  That's great.  Well, the water people got angry.  Water activists, yeah.  See, Ozzy knows.  Water activists.  The drought.  Yeah, with the drought and he's wasting it on rock and roll. 
[01:49:30]  I can't even wash my lawn yet easily.  See, Ozzy knows.  Gracious asshole is.  You think if Black Sabbath started today, you'd have a really tough time with the culture we're in right now?  No, I don't know, but I think the initial thing was everybody was living in this bullshit flower power thing.  You know, we were living in an industrial pollution zone in England, Birmingham. 
[01:50:00]  Well, look, if you go to San Francisco, you shoot to a fucking flower.  Do you have any dump left?  Well, yeah, something gets dumped out on regular, but people on XM here, so you can see that we're quite enjoying ourselves.  As a performer, I always love you because you're so honest about being, at times having low self-esteem or being afraid.  Like, all these things that happen to performers you talk about instead of pretending to be something.  What are you thinking, like, when you're going on stage, what is running through your head right as you're about to walk out? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, I'm, is it going to work or is it not?  And people go, next year I've been doing it 40 years, I'm still, I mean, I did the Vegas thing I just did.  The drummer from FUFA just was doing, you know, when they get, I'm going to interview somebody else, you know, two band members.  And he says to me, he says, let me ask you something, do you get stage fright?  I says, I think I invented stage fright, I mean, I have beyond stage fright. 
[01:51:00]  He says, so do I, and I've tried to explain to people.  But Tony, I find that, if I, I think that if I ever go on stage without stage fright, it's that end of the road because I don't care, you know.  Yeah.  It goes away, though, the second you start, right?  Sometimes.  Yeah, oh, really?  You sometimes...  People go on and I go, good evening, folks.  Yeah.  That's the worst part of being...  Don't look on crack. 
[01:51:30]  The worst part of being a singer is you never know day to day if your instrument works.  Like a guitarist can always, you know...  I don't want that.  The other one don't work, so it won't.  A guitarist can always, you know, grab a new guitar, break something, but a singer wakes up in the morning and goes, uh-oh, I'm going to have trouble today.  Then you worry about it.  I always, I am the worst.  I mean, how does it sound?  I go to my assistant, Tony.  It's fine.  How does it sound now?  I said, it sounded like three minutes ago. 
[01:52:00]  Fine.  I didn't even mind that, though.  Like, I would get all bootleg tapes and sometimes you could tell if you've been on the road for a while, like if the voice cracked.  I love that.  It was like, who cares?  If you want the perfection of a studio album, buy that.  That's what the beauty of a live show is, is you get something a little bit different.  Listen, I hate a band that sounds exactly the same on stage as they do in a studio.  It just irritates me.  It's like Asia.  There's a lot of trickery going on now.  Oh, yeah.  So I was watching, I think it was Britney Spears or somebody.  And they were doing this trapeze thing. 
[01:52:30]  I thought, am I going to see now?  She's saying hello.  And then the word comes out about five minutes later.  Mind you, I mean, when you do TV, you've got to do that.  Anyway, I mean, I suppose that's what it's like.  But it's so obvious that you can't move like that and sing.  Doing spins and catching all this shit in the air.  And singing.  Yeah, but the thing is, you can't sing and do it.  No, absolutely not.  I mean, you only get one hit doing it, you know. 
[01:53:00]  A lot of people, though, live on stage aren't singing because they're dancing around like crazy.  And there's no way.  You know, I could definitely appreciate when you know someone's really singing and moving around on stage a lot.  You go like, wow, that takes some stamina.  You know, and there are some people that it's obvious.  It's like, stop it.  You cannot physically move like that and have those notes come out without sounding like this.  Because you're jumping around or something.  And the mic's moving around. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  This footage of you guys, I saw, I think I saw you lip sync once.  And it was like back in 79 on some show probably in Germany.  I think it was Never Say Die or something like that.  It was like some, like, it might have been 8 in England.  It was some, like, very popular show at the time.  Someone wasn't getting romantic with a chicken after this segment, was it?  No, but the thing is.  But the thing is, when you're playing a loud band, which I have done for many years, the studio equipment, the TV studio equipment, can't handle the decibels. 
[01:54:00]  Right.  And they're not going to come on with a fucking Nazi fucking amplifier.  So if you're just stuck in.  Talking of that, when this animal shit that was going on, you know, killing all these animals, I reckon.  Yeah, yeah.  I go to Germany.  Germany, and this prevention of the protrudes to animal guys comes in with a uniform.  And I go, this is for real.  He goes, I must take 5,000 mark off you. 
[01:54:30]  I said, what for?  Just in case you kill animals on stage.  And I go, are you kidding me?  And he goes, no, it's no joke.  I said, well, what do you remember the word?  Gas.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  And then he got all pissed off at me.  I would assume he would, yeah.  Yeah, but, I mean.  But, yeah, you're just bringing up the past performance.  The word 6 million or anything.  Yeah.  And they're worried about maybe you hurting an animal. 
[01:55:00]  The only animal I ever hurt was me, really.  Yeah.  How are you doing with that?  Because I know you had been kind of like saying it was going good, and then you were slightly.  You look really healthy, man.  You look really healthy.  It's called fat where I come from.  No, you look good.  Fat.  I haven't done anything doggie for a while now, you know.  But I've said that before.  The world can come out of their Aussie bunkers now.  And the next thing, I went on the front of the last rinkhole. 
[01:55:30]  I read a bottle stick on my ass.  Yeah, no more all-terrain vehicles or...  Oh, fuck.  You're staying off of that.  Three miles an hour.  I mean, someone knew it once said to me, how do you think you'll eventually croak?  And I go, I don't know.  I did it twice.  I go three miles an hour on an ITV.  But the drugs were great, though.  Oh, yeah?  I'm in pain.  Oh, no, no more.  Did they give you a morphine? 
[01:56:00]  I used to go, I don't know.  I was shot of that on the Jimi Hendrix album, and I was fine.  There's nothing better than when you're laid up and are actually given drugs that are better  than any drugs you can get, and it's legal.  I used to, a lot of go, if I injured myself, I'd go, Demerol!  Is that sick or what?  How are you feeling now?  Well, I've still got a little bit of pain.  Where?  I don't know. 
[01:56:30]  Let me think.  You write up the prescription while I think.  Yeah.  I remember getting a prescription for Vicodin, and the second I took one and started feeling  it, I dumped them out in my hand and counted them.  I went, one, two, three, how many do I have left?  All right, when should I take half?  I started really getting into...  That's what happened to me the first week.  Then it was like...  Eating down 25 at a clip?  I mean, my cocktail was like an Atten Bumpkin. 
[01:57:00]  I've been in New York, and I went to a guy, and he says, don't ask me for anything.  I said, oh, Doc, you've got to give me a sign.  No, nothing.  And he goes, I was driving up with the guy, man.  I wouldn't leave you that.  No, you've got to write me a scripture for some codeine.  He gave me a half a bottle of codeine.  And I nearly went into a respiratory arrest.  Oh, no. 
[01:57:30]  I'm sure you weren't taking the prescribed dosage.  Oh, no.  It was probably...  He says, take one every three hours.  I take three every one.  I know.  That's the beauty of being dyslexic.  Yeah, you just mixed it up.  What can you do?  Well, you've got to...  I used to go, well, I've got to take them anyway.  If I say 10 now, I won't have to take them for the next week.  Then, yeah, you don't have to take them later.  The next time, I'll run out, and I'm going, Tony, I've got a bad leg.  I mean... 
[01:58:00]  Are you implying that you didn't show moderation?  Sorry?  What happened to you?  Sorry, Jimmy.  Yeah, go ahead.  Okay.  No, I was saying, are you implying that you weren't showing moderation?  Moderation?  Well, that was a...  I thought that was a town in Bavaria.  Um, no, I mean...  No, they put them...  What they'd say on my little thing that I'm going to,  one's too many and ten's not enough.  There was never enough for me.  It was funny.  There's a great thing called Don't Blame Me.  It was a great documentary on you. 
[01:58:30]  And Joe Elias from Def Leppard had a great line.  He said, if you're living, like, a life of debauchery,  and you couldn't find someone better to judge it on than Ozzy,  like, if you're watching Ozzy, like, that's what I want to do  if I'm, like, going to be drinking and getting high.  Yeah.  I was playing that with Def Leppard, uh, that...  What's the guy's name that died?  Um...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was...  Yeah, Steve, I...  Well, I'm good.  I would be out of my mind on the tour of Germany,  and I'd often run into him, and he'd be sitting in a bar,  and I'd be going, well, you know, I need to go to...  I was trying to give him advice, 
[01:59:00]  and I was more out of it than he was.  That's not a good sign, by the way,  if Ozzy is mom giving you advice.  Just don't drink it.  So you can't...  Do you have a couple of beers every now and then, or...  Nothing.  Never, ever did it earlier.  I never had a couple of anything.  Oh, a couple, okay.  I'm just saying you can't...  I just don't...  Because I know...  I know it'll last for about half an hour,  and then I'll be diving through fucking buildings or something. 
[01:59:30]  You'll just want more and more.  I just wake up in some really strange situations, man.  So you'd black out and just, like, wake up not knowing where you were?  Oh, I don't think I've just come out of a blackout.  Or am I now in Los Angeles?  I don't know where I am, you know?  That is a hell of a situation, man.  Because, I mean, I woke up and been in the bathroom.  Yeah.  Which is one of those things where you go...  And you're trying to think, how did I get in the bathroom?  I remember kind of going to bed, but I ended up in the bathroom.  And I can't imagine, like, I was in New York. 
[02:00:00]  No.  And now, where is it?  I'm like, that's LA.  You got to, like, look at the phone or something to see what the area code is  to even see where you are?  Is that, like, what you were going through?  I went to a...  When I was on the road, we saw it.  Have you ever seen I was...  Regency Hider?  No.  With all the open inside, yeah?  You know, it's sort of like...  You can see straight down to the bottom of the building.  Like, it's like the Marriott here on 48th Street.  It's like a giant, like, giant atrium.  48 floors high, yeah.  So, I mean, we would be staying at a bunch of these hotels. 
[02:00:30]  And I know I used to put my keys back in.  I used to have a pocketbook of keys.  And so, I've been doing that white powder all for about three days.  And I'm like, just gacked to the gills.  And I need to sleep.  So, I go and check in the hotel.  But I clean in my room.  She goes, it's like 8 o'clock in the morning.  And the woman goes, I'll just sit in the coffee.  And you will come and tell you when it's ready.  So, I'm sitting in the coffee shop.  My room's like, I think it's 816. 
[02:01:00]  I've got a key in my pocket.  And I swear to you, I'm not making it as well.  I go, oh, I can't wait.  I'll just go in the room.  I'll put my hand in the bag.  I'll put another 816.  So, I go up to them.  And as I get to the room, the maid is just coming in.  And I go, oh, great.  I've finished my room.  Get into bed.  And it's like 8 o'clock in the morning.  We're on stage that evening.  We were touring in Banham Island.  And I wake up.  I look at the clock.  And I think, it's time it doesn't feel right, you know. 
[02:01:30]  So, I look at the clock.  And I go, I'm following the operator.  I go, what time is it?  She goes, it's 6.30.  She says, oh, thanks.  What time of day is it?  6 o'clock in the morning.  And I go, shit.  And I slept through the day, through the night.  And that police thing, I was kidnapped.  I got to the wrong room.  Oh, wow.  You slept through the gig?  Yeah.  You slept in the wrong room? 
[02:02:00]  Banham Island were pissed with me because I had to do it again.  I don't doubt it.  And I slept through the day off.  And he's asleep in some other person's room.  What's the look you get from the other band members?  Oh.  How do you explain that?  I'll put me on the skateboard and tell me.  I don't know.  I mean, no, no.  I just go, I don't know what we're going to do.  Hey, we got Tom peeking in.  We're really late.  We got to take a break.  Right.  Can you hang for a few more minutes, Oz?  We'll talk about the new CD.  We'll talk about OzFest. 
[02:02:30]  We'll do all that after the break.  Absolutely.  I'll tell you this much.  We like I Don't Want to Stop.  We heard that this morning.  And the new CD is called Black Rain.  We'll talk about that and some other things with Ozzy Osbourne.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  We got Ozzy Osbourne in studio.  Running out of time here.  Black Rain, Ozzy's first studio album of all new material in six years.  Very cool.  We've been playing the single, I Don't Want to Stop, here on the show.  Also, OzFest featuring Ozzy, Static X, Lamb of God. 
[02:03:00]  I like Lamb of God a lot.  I'm starting to really dig those guys.  Hatebreed and more.  And tickets are free this year.  Yeah.  And people don't understand that.  How is that working?  Can you go to OzFest.com or something?  I don't understand.  I think it's free.  Are you crazy?  No, I think, yeah, we all know that.  You're quick.  It's like free to get in, but you have to pay to get out, I think.  Oh, is that a pay is the exit?  The old little rascals.  That would be hilarious. 
[02:03:30]  The reason why Sharon did that, I believe, is because the bands on the main stage were  charging more and more to do the show.  I mean, last year I did the second stage.  It was great, great fun.  And so she just said, I'm not going to charge them.  I'm going to get sponsorship.  And that's what she's doing.  Wow.  Was it fun to do this at a smaller stage just because you got to go home early?  You were done in the middle of the afternoon?  No, it was fun, you know.  I mean, don't forget they're getting in there from 9 in the morning until 11 at night. 
[02:04:00]  I mean, Arizona ain't a good place to be from 9 until that time.  So when you throw the bucket of water off the stage, before it hits them, it's steam.  That's a hell of a unique idea, though, to have a sponsored event and then let everybody  in for free.  Yeah, but the Stones have been getting sponsorship for years.  Yeah, but they sure don't let everybody in for free.  And still $200 a day.  I think they sell their tour before they go on, and it's already done. 
[02:04:30]  Well, they had a Brazil.  They just did something in Brazil for like a million people, which was a free concert  in Rio de Janeiro.  And I guess the government's...  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  It was like over a million people.  I don't think Mick needs any more money.  Ozzy doesn't need more money.  I went to do a thing called Rockin' Rio in the back in the 80s.  And we had to do one show, then a couple of days later, you do another show.  And it was overflowing with people.  I don't know how many people...  An ocean of people. 
[02:05:00]  I did the first show, and I'd have been running for two days then.  So by the time...  That was a Saturday.  By the time Wednesday come and do my other show, the fucking stink in that audience  was on.  I took a crap where they stood, you know.  I didn't want to go on.  Oh, God.  That's really fun.  And by the way, if you buy the new CD, you get a code to get two free tickets, reserve  seats while available.  More info on ozzy.com. 
[02:05:30]  He's got all sorts of deals going on.  I liked it.  They're not just a regular ticket, so I think they're tickets...  They're good tickets?  ...into my house in the Beverly.  I asked Ozzy if we're coming back how many OzFest days, because I didn't know if he was  going to do all of them.  And you're doing all of them this year.  Hopefully.  With the help of...  Yeah.  By the way, reality TV hasn't been the same since you guys went off the...  It ain't real!  Come on, mate!  They're trying to get the next Osbournes, and the Hogan family stinks.  Dice's show sucked.  You know, they're trying to get the new Osbournes, and they're just falling short. 
[02:06:00]  I mean, Greta Van Susten did an interview with me the other day, and she said to me, do you  know why the Osbournes is a success?  I said, I'm fucking as baffled now as I ever was.  Because it was no bullshit.  Yeah.  Yeah, a lot of them now are all scripted, and you can tell, because the people aren't good  actors.  You have to be a good actor to pull it off if you're going to do a scripted reality show.  If you know someone, I mean, I've met quite a few of these people, but they ain't like 
[02:06:30]  that, you know?  Right.  Yeah, it's not real.  You didn't seem to care about keeping a rock image.  You just kind of wanted people to see you at home, which is why I think people like it.  I mean, I just wanted...  I didn't...  Sharon said to me, because people would come into my house, and it would just be the way  it is, you know?  And people would go, is she like this all the time, man?  And we'd go, like, what?  You know?  When you've got kids, you've got a full head, you know?  One's got moaning about women, and one's doing this.  And we had no idea it was going to do what it did. 
[02:07:00]  No idea.  I mean, when the ratings would come in, they'd all be...  Oh, screw it.  We'd be 5-5 in and all this.  And I go, well, what's that mean?  It's a 17.9...  It sounds like a fucking earthquake meeting.  And I go, well, can you translate that to record?  If that was record, how many would I have sold?  I thought it would be, like, seven thrillers.  And I go, whoa!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I did not have a clue.  Didn't Sharon say the only thing that they wanted any control over, you guys, 
[02:07:30]  was anything that embarrassed the children that you didn't want,  and that you would have to override,  but anything else was kind of fair game for them to shoot.  Yeah.  And how are the kids doing?  Jack's doing good?  Jack's in China right now.  Yeah?  Bungee jumping in Peking or something.  And he's changed his life around since the show.  It's pretty drastic.  Have you ever heard of a place called Yosemite Park?  Sure.  Sure.  He climbed that Al Cap.  And I go, it doesn't look 4,000 feet for me. 
[02:08:00]  And this guy goes, look on these binoculars.  If you see that little bump in the side, I move across.  You'll see a guy wearing a red jacket.  I'm going, I still couldn't.  And when I looked at the binoculars, it was like just a bit bigger than an ant.  Wow.  And it was him climbing?  It was straight.  It was straight.  As it goes straight up.  Yeah.  It was great.  What is it called?  Al Capitano.  Al Capitano.  Yeah, yeah.  True that.  I can't imagine.  No.  I mean, he says, Dad, do you know what?  It's that high that if you fell off. 
[02:08:30]  I was shocked.  Donnie.  If you fell off, it takes 17 seconds to get to the bottom.  I said, how do you know?  That's a great advert for a watch.  It's IMAX.  He fell 4,000 feet in 17 seconds.  And the watch was so clean.  It's just an arm with no body on it.  He's just a workout fiend now, huh?  Yeah, I've just had to medivac him back to England before I came out.  Because he got some thing from me. 
[02:09:00]  It was in some Burma jungle or something.  And he got this bug.  They're written it was some rat piss.  And I said, I wasn't even there.  He got sick from rat whatever, yeah.  Rat urine.  Wow.  And he really got sick when you had to medivac him out?  I said, yeah, I was going to give him a bit of cheese every day for a few weeks.  What is he, an adventurer now?  Just goes traveling the globe?  He does Jack's adrenaline junkie. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  I mean, he loves it.  God, that's something.  Oof.  But I mean, he did that cub thing.  I'm going, I mean, if I went and there was a magic Latoya Jackson,  they'll go off of chips and they'll be like, I think this is a fucking joke, you know.  And he was, oh, really?  I mean, I was dead.  He went out and...  Unfortunately, the show didn't do well.  But what Ozzy's talking about is Jack was part of the show where they became actual cops 
[02:10:00]  in Indiana somewhere, I believe.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they actually went on real calls.  Oh, yeah.  And I actually watched Ozzy and I liked Jack in it especially, yeah.  He did, it was unbelievable.  You think it's a throwaway show, but no, they're domestic violence calls and they're coming  in and actually like talking to the people that are having a problem.  Yeah, they had Eric Estrada come in.  That's why.  And he'd be like, hey, you're the guy from Chips.  Yeah.  What are you doing here?  I mean, Latoya Jackson, I mean, if she's under arrest, I just start laughing. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  And the fuck just that one where the midget goes into the grocery store.  Yeah.  And the woman, she goes, you've been caught shoveling if you've got to fuck up.  Just step on.  Oh, and that as well.  F-loff or whatever.  That's Wee Man from Jackass.  He was part of that show as well.  Yeah.  But we're running out of time here.  Unfortunately, we could hang out with Ozzy all day, especially when you're telling those  drug stories, Ozzy. 
[02:11:00]  We love those.  I love the single, man.  I love the new single.  It's fantastic.  And when is the actual, the new CD come out?  22nd of this month.  22nd of this month.  And how long did you work on it?  And is there anything about it that's like different?  Well, I had a studio built at home.  And I've always wanted to do that because you get familiar.  I mean, most, a lot of studios have got the same equipment, but it's so cool to have your  own.  And I didn't, I didn't really, for once in my career, nobody was hassling me to deliver, 
[02:11:30]  you know.  So, I think we started it January last year, I think, for a few weeks.  Then we went, I did, I think I was somewhere else.  And he's, it took me a year, but I didn't actually work a year on it.  It was like condensed down to about seven or eight weeks.  If you look at like your career, like, could you say like as a performer, like, okay, this  is a moment where I kind of knew like, we made it.  Like, is there anything you look back on with one moment that you said, this is where I 
[02:12:00]  knew I arrived?  I just can't believe I'm still doing it, you know.  And still people want to see it, you know.  I mean, I've had some incredible things happen in my life.  Well, it's got to be amazing too.  You guys are the headline band when you perform.  I mean, after almost 40 years, you're still the headline band.  And every other band, the adoration every other band shows for you, I think it's got  to be a testament to help.  We just did this thing in Vegas for VH1.  I was with Heart, Genesis, ZZ Topps. 
[02:12:30]  And then I'm on it, I'm going, what the fuck is this all about?  It was nice watching Metallica induct you.  Lars gave a great talk.  James Hetfield got choked up talking about Sabbath.  It was really an amazing thing to watch, those guys.  What was that?  When they were inducting you into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, they've got one in England, but you only got six months and one flop.  And you get in, you know.  Yeah.  I mean, at least a minute, you've got to be 25. 
[02:13:00]  25 years.  25 years, yeah.  Well, they cut us off.  It's a form of stuff because we have to run over to XM and do another show.  So our show is over.  Ozzy Osbourne, I Don't Want to Stop, is the new single.  And it's Black Rain, is the new CD coming out when?  22nd.  The 22nd.  Next Tuesday.  And OzFest is free this year.  Ozzy is on every date, you know, barring injury or something like that or illness.  Go to OzFest.com for the tickets for that, yes.  Tour starts July 12th in Seattle. 
[02:13:30]  So I was going to say, it's great seeing you guys.  Keep on doing it.  All right.  Thanks, Ozzy.  Ozzy Osbourne, everyone.  We're going over to XM.  Have a great day.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.

[02:18:00]  hey by the way thanks to the  pest that joined us for the walk over today  we're not broadcasting at it at this time  but we will soon hopefully  I'm thinking maybe if you're in the area  it would be nice to do the walk over  for maybe the rest of the week  pop over that would be very very nice  they were fun  this dump report is the finest one we've ever had  yeah I want to thank Ozzy  oh where's his single I promised that we would play that  we'll do the dump report  we'll play Ozzy's latest single  and then we'll get into the XM portion 
[02:18:30]  of the show  but man if you were on XM  if you were listening to us on XM I should say  you got a fine Ozzy interview  I think regular radio  was left very very confused  no idea what happened  and I  usually we try to help  the regular radio audience along  but in this case  it was impossible  is this the new record?  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7  17 you already counted?  all Ozzy on the dump report today  yeah unfortunately you're not going to stop Ozzy from cursing  you can't tell him 
[02:19:00]  hey Ozzy we're on regular radio  can you watch the language?  it doesn't work  he cursed in front of the MTV cameras  yeah it doesn't matter  he doesn't care  he's Ozzy for God's sake  and we got 17 dumps  right right  and well we got Club Soda Kenny in studio  to do the dump report today  thanks to Ozzy Osbourne  live from the O.P. and Anthony Show Studios  the Daily Dump Report  morning everyone  17 dumps all attributed to 
[02:19:30]  Ozzy Osbourne  and Al starts off with a little editorialization  oh god  look who stopped by the show today  8, 17 a.m.  this fucking thing  he was referring to the microphone  yeah  we have to read who did it  Ozzy of course  alright  8, 18 a.m.  what the fuck  Ozzy  I don't know what was going on there  Steve was trying to help him with his microphone  and I'm thinking to myself 
[02:20:00]  I think Ozzy knows how to work a mic by now  can figure it out on his own  here comes Steve running into the studio  Ozzy's foot  here's Ozzy's sweet foot  his sweet little foot  got caught in the cord  because of the cumbersome incompetence  working around radio  is that what it was?  yeah  Steve  Steve bumbled over  I did nothing of this sort  I loved crazy train  what happened  what happened Steve  because Ozzy was  Ozzy was very bothered  I'm a singer myself  yes I was in the pendulum  we loved  whatever the band was  I'm nervous  I think the microphone 
[02:20:30]  really bothered him  his foot was tangled  in the mic cord  I love that word  tangled  his foot was tangled  in the mic cord  so I was trying to  it was like deadliest catch  I thought he was going to go overboard  with a crab pot  and he kept  every time he moved his leg  the mic would swing away from him  spin around  so he was like  what the fuck  so I was trying to  I guess  inconspicuously  get it away from his foot  but it wasn't working  inconspicuous  looks like you were  trying to get a salmon  out of the river  I thought you were robbing him 
[02:21:00]  what are you doing  yeah you were all over him  and then Ozzy just was bothered  was he bothered by you  or the fact that  his foot was still tangled  no it was  he was bothered  that his foot was tangled  in the cord  and then he just got bothered  with you  trying to help him  there is nothing bothersome about me  alright  so go ahead  this fucking thing  started the dump report  with Ozzy Osbourne  at 8.17  continue Kenny  right  and then he didn't curse  for 5 minutes  until 8.23  oh you did what the fuck  at 8.18  ok that was still  about the microphone  yeah yeah yeah  8.23  bullshit  flower power  by Ozzy

[02:23:30]  boyfriend's life  that would have  been a good  question  that would have  been a great  question  answered by I  think one of  these dumps  like what the  fuck is this  all about  right  or fuck off  the next one  how has my  boyfriend's  photo printing  and autograph  obsession  already ruined  two of our  brunches  okay  that's a  two part  question  here it is  is Jim  staring at you  uncomfortably  due to creepy  overexcitement  and part two  is how 
[02:24:00]  scared are you  to sit  so close  to a psycho  stalker type  okay  she does  know you  be honest  did Sharon  warn you  about my  boyfriend  as someone  who would  make you  potentially  very  uncomfortable  remember to  be completely  fucking honest  okay  and I think  there's  one more  please  would you  give Jim  a special  nickname  like the  kind of  name  a tribal  elder  would pass  on to 
[02:24:30]  a young  psychopathic  fan  I'm glad  I didn't  read your  stupid  questions  you would  have  embarrassed  me  in front  of the  madman  you should  have read  those  questions  I didn't  know they  were there  of course  you should  have  that would  have been  hilarious  I didn't  know they  were there  oh I'd love  him to have  a little  nickname for  me  hey I promised  Ozzy's people  that we would  play a single  we ran out of  time over there  so we're gonna  play I Don't  Want to Stop  from the Black  Rain CD that  comes out a week  from tomorrow  and don't forget  Ozfest.com for free  Ozzy tickets  okay  here's I Don't  Want to Stop  the brand new one  from Ozzy Osbourne  I Don't

[02:26:00]  Mama don't cry, I just wanna say hi  Like crazy danger and fear  Everybody's walking, but nobody's talking  It looks a lot better from here  All my life I've been over the top  I don't know what I'm doing  All I know is I don't wanna stop  If it's all fired up, I'm gonna go till I drop  Throw a drill in the way, don't make me  I don't wanna stop 
[02:26:30]  Why don't they ever listen to me?  It's just a one-way conversation  Nothing they say is gonna set me free  Don't need no mental reservation  Too many religions for only one God  I don't need another savior  You're trying to change my mind 
[02:27:00]  You know I'm one of this kind  Ain't gonna change my bad behavior  All my life I've been over the top  I don't know what I'm doing  All I know is I don't wanna stop  If it's all fired up, I'm gonna go till I drop  Draw a drill in the way, don't make me  I don't wanna stop  All my life I've been over the top  I don't know what I'm doing  All I know is I don't wanna stop  If it's all fired up, I'm gonna go till I drop  Draw a drill in the way, don't make me

[02:28:00]  guitar solo 
[02:28:30]  guitar solo 
[02:29:00]  It's got quite a beat to it, man  Very pleasurable  Two instant feedbacks  One  Fucking incredible  The next one  Fucking awful  And that is  And that is our radio show  Right there  Yep  That's everything  In the world  I like the song a lot  Yeah, me too  But I  Someone doesn't like  Song is something  People are going to agree  Or disagree on  But it is amazing  But it's just funny  It's one after the other  It's not even  Any gray area  Same person  Probably  Very zombie-ish  Yeah 
[02:29:30]  A little zombie  A little zombie  Guitar solo too  Which you don't hear much  These days  It's all Zach  They say  Zach Wilde  Codered a lot of it  I bet you Zach said  Look, I'm playing  A guitar solo  And Ozzy's like  Alright  What the fuck  You want to do  You do whatever you want  Buddy  My goal is for Ozzy  To remember me  He sort of did  You think so  Yeah, absolutely  He did  No  When you were talking  About the induction  A little bit  Yeah  Listen to the interview again  There was an awareness there  No, he's Ozzy  I'm just a boy  The love in the  The love in your eyes 
[02:30:00]  Jimmy  That I saw  Was just  The rest of the guys do  The rest of the band  Remembers me  You were so cute  Did you get everything signed?  Yeah, only a couple things  It was the Sabbath photo  The giant Sabbath photo  Which I now need  Bill Ward for  And then two other pictures  Of me and Ozzy  Why didn't you get Bill  Oh, Bill Ward  He wasn't there  Yeah, it was really  That's right, I forgot  Yeah, Bill's  His health  We'll have to get him  On his own  He'll be out  So you get Bill Ward  Then you got the  That picture signed  Yeah  Oh, that'll obsess you  For a while  You know what was the best  Was during commercial break  When Ozzy was just talking 
[02:30:30]  You know, sitting there talking  And Jimmy's talking to him  And you were so excited  Like you were leaning  So far forward  And talking to Ozzy  All excited  I was so thrilled for you  I probably annoyed him  No, I don't think you did  Yeah, I didn't ask too many  Just, you know  It was too bad  We had commercials today  Because the stuff  He was just talking about  During the commercials  Was very interesting  Yeah, yeah  You know, Johnny Carson  And the difference between  Letterman and Carson  Well, no, you just talk about Carson  As a whole  I don't know if he was ever  On the play show  You were going to ask him  If he was on Carson 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, I actually was too  But he seemed like he knew  So I just assumed  He had to be on there  Just a fan  Oh, just a fan  Yeah, yeah  He's been on Leno  I've seen him on Leno  Sabbath's performing on Leno  He was talking about the talk shows  Just being like Groundhog Day  Now  Like Groundhog's Day  The movie  Where it's just the same  Every night  The same thing happens  Over and over  And how Johnny was, you know  Different  If somebody tripped  Coming out on stage  They would talk about it  You know  They would kind of hit on that  And now they don't really  Do that anymore  I want to know Ozzy's cologne  Ozzy smells rich and good  Ozzy  That was the same cologne 
[02:31:30]  He had on last time  Ozzy  Whatever Sharon's picking out  For him is fucking  I want someone  I want to write to her  And say  What is Ozzy wearing  Because I want to wear it  So I can smell like him  That's when the restraining order  Comes in  I don't remember  That is when she goes to court  And gets the restraining order  No  Has it filed  And then  You know what he would do  He'd have Ozzy sign  The restraining order  Ozzy  Could you please  Here's a restraining order  Right  I just want  I just  I'm just a boy  Who wants to smell like someone else  You're just a boy  One of the listeners will get it  Because the last time Ozzy was in 
[02:32:00]  Which was what  Two and a half years ago maybe  Two years ago  He said exactly what it was  And it was the same scent  How much cologne do you have to put on  Where Ozzy walked in the room  And you were already smelling him  And he wasn't even near us  I think it's probably aftershave  It's probably the stuff they put on with the hand  I think smells stronger  And it's also  It's kind of creepy  To smell a man's cologne by the way  Oh I love it  You did  When it's like that  That just smells rich  Yeah  He just smells good  Yeah  Yeah what's his name  Did have a strong  Wayne Newton  Wayne Newton had a strong cologne as well 
[02:32:30]  It's a whole vibe to you  When you walk in man  It's not a cheap shitty smell  Yeah yeah  It's like you  There's a presence  Just walk in the room  Yeah Wayne Newton  Smelt rich  It's just  The smell of wealth  And fame  Some wise ass  Louis B from Manhattan  Nice  More rock  And let's talk  You asked for it  You got it  Cow born with two noses  One farmer in Wisconsin  Had to look twice at his new calf  One time for each nose  Take a look 
[02:33:00]  This is Lucy the cow  She was born with two noses  The second nose sits on top  At first the farmer thought Lucy was kicked in the nose  Her breeder says it's a rare deformity  But they do keep track of such mutations  He says if it happens again  They'll start looking at the sire that they used to breed  Both noses are working just fine folks  Just to let you all know  Like I said  There's a pig in the bar house  Why is everybody looking at me? 
[02:33:30]  Oh he's making a joke like the pig had sex with the cow  Because it looks like a pig nose on the cow  It does  It's true  It doesn't look like a second cow nose  It looks like a pig nose on a cow  So he's making kind of a joke  Like everyone's looking at the pig  And the pig's going  Like hey  I fucked the cow  Shouldn't the pig be outraged at this point?  Yes  Why would a pig whistle anyway?  Pigs root around their own shit  They don't care what you think  They don't care  Oh my goodness  I have a reputation to uphold 
[02:34:00]  Having sex with a cow is the least of their problems  That's a feather in a pig's cap  You climbed up and did that?  Good for you  That's like a pig getting a supermodel  Sorry  How would a pig hold on?  Pigs have little stupid hooves  Little cloven hooves  Yeah  Little devil feet  They serve them up for food  Pig's knuckles  Who would eat that?  I don't know  Especially pickled  There's so many good things on a pig to eat  Pork chops 
[02:34:30]  I love Roland  Why?  Just that he had that happen  Set that up  Roland was very good  Hooked it up  Roland was very good  Ozzy  Should have made Roland ask him a couple  Thank you, Thanikin  That means that we'll have a guest in June now  Oh, no, no  We get one guest a month  Of statue  We didn't coordinate  This is all of our faults  We didn't coordinate  Because Parker Posey was going to come in  But we didn't all talk it over  Yes  And that would have been a good one to get  I was fine without having her on  Really?  I think she's great  I like Parker Posey 
[02:35:00]  I think she's very funny  She's adorable  Yeah  Yeah  Alright, this is a sick story  A woman survives internal  Internal  Decapitation  Did you hear this one yet?  Yeah  Read this one  This is really  Brutal  It just gives me the heebie-jeebies  And an incredible headache  Like thinking about  How much of a headache  You would have from this  No  You know when you're hungover  And you have that bad headache  I usually have to take a cold rag  And put it on my head all day long 
[02:35:30]  I'm picturing that  Times eight  G-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-gillion  Is she paralyzed?  That's what my question is  Because  I guess we'll find out in the story  She looked a little screwy  In the paper  They had like her head  In one of those cages  And her eyes were completely crossed  I would imagine  They were  This is probably the craziest thing  That could happen to you  And you still  And you still live  And you live  Yeah  Yes  Listen to this  I remember the impact  And then 
[02:36:00]  I had no control over  My head  In a matter of seconds  30 year old  Stop playing the clip from the ring  What is that?  That's like from Saw  She has sex?  What is that?  That's her  Oh my god  She's trying to explain what happened to her  Her head was off  I guess her windpipe would stretch or something  And her vocal cords got screwy  Well basically what you're hearing is Shannon  She was in a car crash that separated her skull from her spine 
[02:36:30]  Separated her skull from her spine  Decapitated  She was decapitated  It's just the flesh  The flesh was holding her together  Blood  Like veins and arteries  And your windpipe  Just all that stuff is still attached  But the skeletal system  The whole thing that holds it there in place  Yeah  Was severed  Yeah  Oh my god  That is the creepiest thing that could happen 
[02:37:00]  She should be dead  I mean you never are supposed to survive a decapitation  I backed up  Here we go  I remember the impact  And then  I had no control over  My head  In a matter of seconds  30 year old Shannon Malloy's life changed  A car crash January 25th  On a Nebraska road  Dealt such a powerful blow  That her head dislocated from her spine  The clinical term for her condition  Internal decapitation 
[02:37:30]  I wasn't focused so much  On the pain  I just kept thinking  I have to stay alive  Dr. Gary Giselli says  Shannon's will to live is what saved her  I've seen it once before  And the patient unfortunately didn't make it  Five screws drilled into Shannon's neck  And four more in her head  Keep her stabilized  It's called a halo  And prevents her skull from shifting  Not exactly an easy or pain free procedure  Oh my god  A car wreck  Tony Soprano should have held her nose shut 
[02:38:00]  Oh you did it  Oh no  Oh you did it  I didn't say anything  Oh you did it  I didn't say a word  Oh like he wasn't going to figure that out  No  I actually have not  I know he didn't figure anything out  So that's all I said  Alright  That's all I said  I'm going to watch him today man  I want to catch up  Yes you better  What happened to Frank Vincent calling on Mondays?  Don't say nothing  Vincent had another hysterical line  Did he?  God he's got funny lines  Alright  I'll be against every funny line  He's a funny guy 
[02:38:30]  I like that when Tony's on the phone with him  No I'm not going to ruin it  Jimmy  This doesn't ruin anything  It's just a funny thing  I don't want to know that Tony has a phone  I thought the phones were lost  Thanks for nothing  There goes my theory  That they had gone back to western times  It just reminds me of what all of us do to each other  Because  Tony was blowing some  No  Are you nuts  At one point  Tony's talking to Frank Vincent's character there  And they're discussing a business deal that they don't agree on 
[02:39:00]  And Frank Vincent says something to Tony  And Tony goes  Well now this is me hanging up on you  And Frank Vincent just holds the phone up and goes  Click  And hangs up on him first  And Tony gets all pissed off  That he got the hang up in first  That's great  And the look on Frank Vincent's face is pure satisfaction  By the way  If you were listening to Friday's show  I was at F.H. Riley's over the weekend  Yes  Kind of celebrating my brother's birthday a little bit  And I'm sitting there with my brother  And actually Steve from Bayshore 
[02:39:30]  And the phone rings  It's Bob Saget calling back  Get out of here  Remember we did that  We left a message with Bob  You left a nice little voicemail message  And he called back  I run out of F.H. Riley's so I could hear him  You know  Because a bunch of pests ended up down there  And you know  Thanks for supporting the restaurant and all that  And thanks for what you guys did on Saturday  And so I ran out so I could hear him  He's like  I'm assuming that message was a goof  I'm like  Yes Bob it was 
[02:40:00]  Yes  Sorry  And then he's like  You're not going to give this number to anyone are you  He's like  Now I'm scared that all your fans are going to have my cell number  Look he was all worried  You left a number like a friend  Like a message  You left a message like you were a pal of his  Hey just goofing around a little  And he's like  You're not going to give this out are you  Look I'm going to change my number  He goes  I was a little freaked out at first  But then halfway through the message I realized  Oh okay he's doing this on the radio  But then he's like  Oh no  You're like  You're definitely not going to give this out are you 
[02:40:30]  I'm like nah  Oh he's not your pal  It was pretty funny whatever  Not much more to it  Alright here's more from this woman  That survived internal decapitation  My skull slipped off of my neck  Oh my god  Oh god  Oh my god  Her skull slipped off of my neck  That's got to suck  Oh my god  That could be  Oh my god  The most horrific thing ever  That's what I'm saying  What do you do  When your skull slips off your spine 
[02:41:00]  Looks stupid  And your head  Yeah  Exactly  Your head  What do you do  Put it back  Can you  You can't stand up  You would have to like  You would probably be compelled  To hold it in place  And just freak out  Thinking  Oh my god  My head is falling off  You want to sneeze  Your head becomes detached  From your body again  Oh you couldn't  Imagine that  You get a little itch in your nose  And so I go  Oh no don't sneeze  Don't sneeze 
[02:41:30]  So the head must have flopped to the side  Flopped to the side  Oh my god  That's probably why she sounds like that  Everything  Your windpipe  And your vocal cords  And everything  Probably bent  Oh my god  I'm just speculating here  Because I'm  I'm not a  My brother  My brother broke his neck  Playing lacrosse  And he continued playing in the game actually  He was in a tournament down in Virginia  And then he  I guess he knew some players on the other team  So they all went out drinking and stuff  He had the worst headache he's ever had right 
[02:42:00]  And he's just  He's in college  So they're messing around drinking  And just having a good old time at the bar  And the headache was so bad  When he got back to his hotel or whatever  He went to the emergency room  And they got an x-ray  And they come in the room with the x-rays  And they look at my brother  They go  Don't move  Don't move  And then I believe  The doctor looked at the x-ray  And said  If I wasn't looking at you  Moving all your limbs  I would say this person is paralyzed  And he was in a bar that night  Fucking around 
[02:42:30]  She's lucky  And then he had the halo  And when they took the halo off  Because you lose all your muscles  His head completely flopped  And he had to kind of hold his own head up  Until he got the muscles  Do the exercises  Do the neck exercises  How long was it on for?  A couple months?  Man, I gotta ask him  Maybe he could email me  But at least  I think it was all summer  I think it was a minimum of two months  Can they take it off so you can map?  No  Okay  That would be so claustrophobic  Well, it's the halo 
[02:43:00]  And then it's this huge kind of like vest thing  I think the whole thing weighs like 40, 50 pounds  You gotta sleep in that  And you gotta sleep kind of with your head  In the middle of this thing  You can't like rest it on a pillow  Then again, your option is  You never move below the neck again  Oh man, he ain't complaining  He's not complaining  You gotta take a dump with that thing on you  Like a big birdcage  What I would do is  I would probably just put like a birdcage  Like cloth over me  And then when people were boring me  I'd go  Yada da da da  Hope you liked our show  It would just flop all in front of me  Yeah  Like a big  I would just pretend I was a bird 
[02:43:30]  And I'd be talking  I'd be like  You know  And I'd drop the curtain  In the middle of the sentence  I'd be like  You know, I'm really gonna  Go to sleep  Because that's what birds do  Don't be birds  It's not night, you idiot  It's a fucking curtain  Wear your instincts, bird  My skull slipped  Huffled my neck  About five times  Every time he tried to screw  This way  And I would slip  That made rebuilding Shannon's next drink a priority 
[02:44:00]  But there were other complications  I had a fractured skull  Swollen brain stem  Bleeding in my brain  I also have a GI tube in my stomach  A GI tube?  Nerve damage  In her stomach?  To my throat  So I can't swallow  Nerve damage  Doctors are working on that  But today her skull has healed  She's well enough to have her halo removed 
[02:44:30]  I gotta tell you something  I usually  Holy Jesus  I wanna hear every word  When we play audio  I missed a few things in that  And I ain't bagging up  I am not backing up  No, it's painful to listen to  I heard a few words there  That's all I need  It sounds like E-Rock  After his push-ups  He did  Well, E-Rock did interesting push-ups  Every time he went down for a push-up  He took a bite of steak  Then leaned over  No, it was salmon  Jesus  Boy, that fucking story changed quickly 
[02:45:00]  I had a piece of fat-free salmon cake  Salmon cake  Can we get E-Rock in here now?  Now, the bet started four days ago officially  What?  Oh, his arm got thrown up  E-Rock  I just asked you if you come in  You don't have  What's wrong?  Nothing  Ooh  Sam just sprinting  Sprinting with the camera  This is tough love  We want you to lose the weight  Now, the  We have one more clip, by the way 
[02:45:30]  From this  Oh, do we?  Yeah  Okay  She's healed now or something?  Well, they said they're taking the halo off  So her neck and skull are reconnected  But she's still got crossed eyes  And something  I don't know  Something about her stomach  It sounded like  G.I. Joe in her stomach  But of course that wasn't it  I heard something like that  And like I said  Usually I would back up and play it again  So we'd get every word  I'm like, I'm just going to assume  It's a G.I. Joe in the stomach  I don't need to really know  She sounded like she was suffocating  I can't listen to that  Yeah, it does 
[02:46:00]  It sounds like she's suffocating  Like there's too much effort  To living  At that point  Oof  So, um  Heebie-jeebies  Or what?  We'll talk about Paris after too  Wow  I got a headache  Just like listening to it  Like my neck hurts  Alright, let's play the third clip  Then we'll get to  That's why I can't watch like ER  Then we'll get to E-Rock  Here's the third clip of Shannon  Shannon's mom, Robin Frazee  Is amazed that her daughter  Has survived this ordeal  And has recovered as well as she has  I'm glad my daughter  Is okay 
[02:46:30]  You realize it's just the way  The whole family talks  Oh my God  They just live way up in the mountains  Yeah  It's like, yeah  They live at like 25,000 feet  They're Sherpas  Yeah  That's the joke  Robin remembers the first few days  In the hospital  And calls them  Touch and go  One doctor continued to tell the family  To prepare for the worst  It was just really scary  Because he just kept saying  We've never ever seen this injury 
[02:47:00]  In a person that's alive  Some bedside manner  And you need to say your goodbyes now  Well, goodbye won't be happening anytime soon  Oh my God  It's a miracle  Oh, it's an absolute miracle  It's a miracle that  She was able to survive  From the actual accident  And also a miracle that she's made  The progress that she's made  Doctors will continue to work  On Shannon's swallowing and vision  She says removing the halo  Was a big step for her  Making her feel like  A full recovery is in sight  Oh yeah  I would ideally like 
[02:47:30]  Three, four recovered  No, that's not going to be  A great possibility  I could come really close  So  I have no idea  A miracle  A miracle is her  Jogging away from the accident  This is an amazing medical anomaly  I love how the word miracle  Is tossed around sometimes  A miracle is her going  Wow  I should have died  In that accident  And the interesting part  Is the swallowing issue  Is being pushed by her husband 
[02:48:00]  That's all he cares about  He's like  Just fix that  Fix that  I really should have  A laughing box around my head  Let's go to Bill  In Jersey City  Bill, what's up?  Yeah, it's a shame  She got the halo off now  Otherwise she could have  Got a job as a Pez model  Alright  Very nice  Alright  Hey, E-Rock  Four days into the diet  Yeah  But you said you started today  Yeah  Because the book says  Start on a Monday  No  Sam, why don't you wait 
[02:48:30]  I'm not doing that  Why?  Because it's every week  You're right  On Thursday  We want to just  I would be curious  If he put the extra weight on  But  Smoothie  You're refusing?  That's on my diet too  What?  I would love a smoothie  Not that one  This is mine  So you're not  You're not going to like  Do a quick way?  Well I think it'd be interesting  To see if he did anything  Over the weekend  Because you may have  Just through eating  A little bit better  Have done okay  Yeah, the only reason  We want to  Is just because  Of the whole steak fiasco  Since you're starting  On a Monday  I think we should see 
[02:49:00]  Where you're at  Because you might even  Be a pound ahead of the game  You rock  That means you think  You gain weight, right?  You rock  No, I'm just not going  To fuck with this diet  What does that mean?  By what?  Weighing yourself?  Yeah  No, not just by weighing myself  But I don't know  It's redoing your whole  Lifestyle pretty much  As far as eating  Thinking  Exercising  All that  Sexuality  You gonna try girls now?  Why didn't you get  A picture with Ozzy?  I was ready  I had the camera  There was too many people 
[02:49:30]  Publicists and whatever else  I was with him  Tony and then  Those guys are cool as hell  You asked me if I would  Get a picture with him  I was willing to do it  Who's the big black dude?  Probably security  He's a guy  Yeah, security guy  He's a mountain  Yeah, he's friendly  I'm like, are you on our side  Hopefully  And he said, yes I am  I'm like, okay  Glad to meet you  He's there to protect  Ozzy  Ozzy ain't gonna be  Brawling in the streets  If someone don't like him  So I would like to see  How Eric is starting out  Because what was you last week?  2-14  Actually less than we thought  2-14, right? 
[02:50:00]  Yeah  Alright, let's go  He's got a strip  Not to be a dick  But he's got a strip down  Well, who's being a dick?  If it's not hot, why do it?

I'll make a deal with you  Because we do weigh you every Thursday  How about we weigh you every Monday  Starting with today?  Ah, since the diet starts  It's not a bad idea  It is a great idea  We promise we will not weigh it

Stains?  You know what?  You knew you were getting weighed today, by the way

How much?  12.6  And you didn't want to be weighed, see?  He lost 1.4 pounds  See, you already helped yourself by weighing today  Here you go  He probably had lost 11 pounds until that dinner last night  That steak dinner  Did you take a dump?  Juicy steak  No  No dump today either  What do you do?  Look at that  That'll be four more pounds  Look at that  Look at that  This is a salad, big dessert  You know he takes elephant dumps

I do Opie  Better  You didn't need one  I went to Ticketmaster  But you didn't need one  You're going to be there  Hey um  How much were the pre-sale tickets  Remember we had those tickets  Go on sale  Like a  A special thing  Through the website  Yeah I don't remember  A penny  They were a penny  Somebody contacted me 
[02:56:00]  And said they were  Extraordinarily  Like a couple hundred dollars  A ticket  I'm pretty sure that's wrong  And I want to make sure  That's wrong  A couple hundred dollars  For what?  Let's make sure  No  I think it's wrong  I don't know  I want to make sure  Our fans are not being gouged  That's all  Ticket gouged  The news loves disaster  What's going on?  They're doing this whole story  On a cruise ship  Sinking 
[02:56:30]  Passengers being evacuated  From a cruise ship  In Alaska  And then they show it  And it looks like  One of those  Oldie time river boats  That you'd see  On the mighty Mrs. Sip  And it was  It's kind of by the shore  Yeah  And it was taking on water  But it stopped  There were like  Two hundred people on it  But they're trying  To make it sound like  A cruise ship disaster  At first they said  Cruise ship sinking  Oh yeah  That looks like  From a Mark Twain  Yeah  It's like an old time 
[02:57:00]  Steamboat  Paddle boat thing  It's a Staten Island ferry  It bumped into something  And everyone's fine  That's it  Now everyone's like  Cruise ship rescue  Underway  Off Alaskan coast  Stop  I hope that takes  A long time  Oh  Try that joke again  They're just awful  The way they cover it  They're just awful  They just can't  They want to make it  It's not a big deal  Bigger than life  Yeah  Hey Paris Hilton  So what'd you have  On that there Jimmy? 
[02:57:30]  Oh  Oh by the way  Cents are  Cents  Stamps are  41 cents now  Unless you buy  The forever stamp  I don't really get  That whole concept  I understand it  But I don't get it  It gets more money  Into the post office  Because people  Would spend  Way more money  On stamps  Than they ever would  On a regular basis  So  And then they take  That money  And they put it  Into a nice  Savings account  Is that it?  And watch the interest  To get their bank book  Yeah  And have it stamped  Like if you buy 
[02:58:00]  These forever stamps  But let's say you buy  A trillion of them  They're supposed to be  Good forever  No matter how high  The price of stamps goes  Right  Your forever stamps  Will be good  Regardless  So 20 years from now  You can mail a letter  For 41 cents  Right  But now  What'll it be in 20 years?  51 cents  Or something  Like  It's brilliant  I don't really see  The real economic  It's for the old  Bettys  Is it?  Yeah  So they go  And they probably  Spent hundreds of dollars 
[02:58:30]  On the 41 cent  Oh  I'm gonna buy this  And what are they  Actually saving?  And this is where  The post office  Makes out  They will never use  All the stamps  They buy  Because if you  No  If you're buying  Something called  The forever stamp  You want to buy  Enough to last  Forever  Forever  So you're buying  Way more stamps  Than you'll ever use  In a lifetime  Boxes of these things  Yeah  It's brilliant  It's a great  Great marketing campaign  And the real savings  Is just based on 
[02:59:00]  How high the stamp goes  Like if all of a sudden  A stamp  Is  Forty dollars each  It is  Forty dollars  To mail a letter  Now you've made out  You've made a wise investment  If it goes up  Ten cents  In  Ten years  Well they  Dropped the bulk rate down  Did they?  Well they're in competition  So  You know  They can't just turn around  And make  You know  Mailing a letter  Over a dollar or something  Then people will be like  Well then I'll 
[02:59:30]  I'll send out all my  Wedding invites  I'll do email  Yeah why wouldn't you anyway  Right right  People still  For some reason  Oh those stupid papers  They're just awful  I'm lazy with a couple  Of my bills  And I  Instead of putting them  In the computer  I like every month  Just write out a check  And send it out  But  For the most part  Forty one cents  That ain't bad  It's still at the point  Where it's like  You think 300 million people  Live in this country  You could write  A name  And some numbers  On an envelope  And for forty one cents  Drop it in a box 
[03:00:00]  And it ends up  Exactly where you  Wanted it to go  That's pretty fucking amazing  For forty one cents  I always thought  It should have been  A lot higher  It should have been  Higher like years ago  They should have made  Five bucks  Yeah  That's an amazing thing  Yeah  You know the machinery  Involved  And the people  And the transportation  And the friggin  Coordinates  That are set up  To have a letter  Get from point A  To point B  No matter where it is  I want to send this  To San Diego  I just put this thing  On it  And throw it in a box  And it's going to get there 
[03:00:30]  I put some name  And some coordinates  On it  That really should  And they know exactly  Where it's supposed to go  That really should cost  A lot more  Fly over the country  And look down  Yeah  There's a pinpoint  And they know exactly  Where it's got to go  For forty one cents  Alright what do we got  On Paris Hilton  That's our stamp break  Thank you  I want to do a new segment  On the Opie and Anthony program  Called Jim's Hot Celebrity Gossip Mondays  Jim's Hot Celebrity Gossip Mondays  Thingy

[03:10:00]  Clayton County Police  Planned to let prosecutors decide  If a husband will be charged  With the shooting death  Of his wife  Apparently  He thought she  Was an intruder  Uh huh  Investigators say  60 year old  Horace Henry  Shot and killed  His 56 year old wife  Andrea  Yesterday  Channel 2's  Richard Elliott  Is live outside  Clayton County Police  Headquarters  Richard  How do you do that  Javita  Very tragic story here  A man described as  Retired and disabled  Apparently thought  Someone was breaking  Into his apartment  So he grabbed his gun  But the burglar  Turned out to be his wife 
[03:10:30]  Just  I'm  Tragic  Unfortunate  And so  Clayton County Police  Continue to investigate  A shooting death  Outside these  College Park apartments  Officers got the call  Shortly before  5 o'clock Tuesday  Of a husband  Shooting his wife  Here at the  Ashford  At Stone Ridge  Apartments  Off Flat Shoals Road  At first  They thought it was  A domestic dispute  When the officers arrived  They found the victim  Line on the walkway  In front of the front door  What did he blast  Through the door  Yeah this is 
[03:11:00]  Suspicious  Something's going on  And it's an apartment  It's only one way in  You see the video of this  I'm sorry  Oh I know  This is despicable  These pieces of shit  Beating this  World War 2 veteran  A World War 2 vet  And just  Mercilessly  Beating him  Had him pinned  Between the door  Of his car  That the guy  Was carjacking  And a car  That was next to him  So the old guy  Couldn't even fall down  And is mercilessly  Punching him  In the side of the head  As hard as he can 
[03:11:30]  More times  Than I could count  And then  As he opens the door  The old man  Falls to the ground  And the guy  Gets in the car  And apparently  Drives away  Who are the guys  Waiting  Just people  Milling about  And nobody  Helped the old guy  No one  Helped the guy  At all  Why would they  Did they see  What was going on  I don't know  Kind of hard not to  Do we have that  Whole story yet  Kind of hard not to  I'd like to know  More about that one  That guy should be  Lined up against the wall  By the police  And just shot  Alright here we go 
[03:12:00]  More to the  Never happened  But once detectives  Started their investigation  They found it was  Something else entirely  60 year old  Horace Henry  Apparently heard  His wife Andrea  Coming home  And thought  She was a burglar  The husband  Thought that  He was being burglarized  When the door  Opened slightly  He fired one round  Between the crack  And ended up  Striking the wife  In the neck  Andrea Henry  Was taken to Grady  But later died  Clayton County police  Will continue to 
[03:12:30]  Investigate  But do say  It all appears  To be a horrible  Accident  They're going to  Review all the  Evidence  And let's say  That charges are  Pending  But it's certainly  Something that will  Be presented to  The DA's office  For them to review  What an idiot  And what will  Happen then  The DA's office  Will take that  Information and  Present it to a  Grand jury  And let that  Grand jury decide  If any charges  Will be filed  The fuck is  Going on with  The latest  Geico commercial  You're watching  The Geico commercial  With the  It looks like a  YouTube kind of  Format 
[03:13:00]  And it's some  Kid just making  Faces  Really weird  Faces  Anything  But those  Stupid cavemen  I'm fine with it  That's Tina  We're getting  Right to now  Again they'll  Kind of use  This story  Like you know  Anti-gun  Thing  Fine  Whatever  Why did he  Think she was  A burglar  I don't know  Maybe she wasn't  Supposed to be  Home at a certain  Time  Or I don't know  But the thing  You don't  Shoot through a  Crack in the  Door  You stand back 
[03:13:30]  You take good  Cover  Where you can  Identify your  Target  And see what  Comes in your  Door  That's what  You do  You don't  Shoot through  Doors  You don't  Shoot crack  You don't  Shoot at  Noises  People are  Dopes  Yeah here's  Here's the  Carjacker  Beating the  91 year old  World War 2  Vet  That's nice  Detroit police  Say they have  Arrested a suspect  In the carjacking  And beating  Of a 91 year old  World War 2  Veteran outside  A store  On Detroit's 
[03:14:00]  West side  The news comes  Just hours  After WXYZ  Aired shocking  Video of the  Attack  The video may  Be hard to watch  But it's even  Harder to believe  That someone  Could beat a  91 year old  Man punching  This World War  2 veteran  21 times  He come up  He want a  Light for a  Cigarette  Just his eye  He threw a  Punch at me  Witnesses  Say the male  I'm sorry  Witnesses  Say the male  Suspect  Stands 5'9  Tall  With a slim 
[03:14:30]  Build  He had braids  In his hair  And an earring  In his left ear  He wore expensive  Credit glasses  That were told  Were recovered  By police  Missing something  That might be  A little more  Helpful in the  Description  Well they have  Arrested a suspect  That's probably  Why they don't  Need it  But  It's amazing  Why would they  Have to put  His height  And all that  Stuff  Not going to  Put his race  Why is it so  Hard to put race  In a description  Where the physical  Is important  In locating the  Person  You know what  Is easy  If you want  To get a  Suspect  And you know 
[03:15:00]  What they look  Like  Say white  Black  Asian  Fat  Skinny  Fat  Skinny  Bald  Has hair  Male  Female  It's part  Of a description  That is really  Helpful  To tell you  The truth  In  Eliminating  A lot  Of people  Instead of  Walking around  Looking at  Every five  Foot nine  Tall  Person  With slim  Build  It's a little  Easier  If you give 
[03:15:30]  A little  Better description  Of how you  Can describe  Somebody by  Looking at  Them immediately  And don't have  A tape measure  To see how tall  They are  And then these  Dummies mention  Braids  Earring  And Cartier  Glasses  All things  That can be  Changed  Yeah  You can't  Change your  Race  It's  Just  Mind boggling  The young  Stranger  Approached  This is what  Sucks  The guy  Was a  World War  II vet  He's getting  Up there  In age  Obviously  Ninety  Ninety  And now  He's got  To worry  About  This  Probably
