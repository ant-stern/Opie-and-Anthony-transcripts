<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, live from the New York City Hard Rock Cafe, was a chaotic and highly offensive affair.  The show began with their first-ever live broadcast from the city, marked by technical difficulties, including microphone issues and a sound check on-air.  Recurring characters like Pat from Munaki (who distributed a listener feedback CD), Club Soda Kenny, and Martini Steve were present in the studio.  The hosts engaged in their typical brand of crude humor, focusing on topics like vomiting, wife-beating, and various sexual acts. Pat's missing toe became a running gag, with listeners suggesting increasingly outrageous acts for a "MiFi" prize.  Stand-up comedian Francine appeared, but her set was poorly received. Stalker Patty performed a bizarre gravity demonstration, later removing her shirt and crawling on the floor wearing a Krusty the Clown mask.  The show announced they had secured exclusive PGA golf broadcasting rights.

The broadcast continued with a segment where Patty removed her top on stage, eliciting little audience reaction.  This transitioned into a bar opening segment where the crew discussed drinks. Kenny told a series of offensive Irish jokes.  Technical difficulties persisted, alongside numerous prank phone calls made from a cell phone left in the ladies' room, using increasingly vulgar and abusive language.

The show also featured promotions for Jim Norton's HBO special, and a poorly received attempt by a listener resembling John Candy to recite a *Planes, Trains, and Automobiles* speech.  Extensive discussion surrounded the Robert Blake trial acquittal, coupled with tasteless jokes and the playing of audio from Scott Peterson's sentencing, including victim impact statements.  Don Geronimo's dog, Rudy's death, and a potential Geronimo-Opie cruise encounter were also mentioned.  Further "MiFi" giveaway suggestions ranged from eating a cigar to other dangerous acts.  Club Soda Kenny delivered a rambling, incoherent news report while sweating profusely. Bob Kelly, fresh from Iraq, shared his experiences, including details about Saddam Hussein's palace and encounters with various troops, culminating in accounts of a trip with Colin Quinn, including a rocket attack near Fallujah and Quinn's bullying behavior.

A heavily intoxicated man urinated in his pants on stage for a "MiFi".  The show announced a new sponsor, Sexits.com, resulting in a chaotic on-air interview with company representatives and a woman claiming to be the "Canal Street Madam," discussing her past, the sex industry, and a purported 9/11 connection.  This segment also included more offensive Irish jokes and a verbal attack on restaurant owner Frenchy.  Angry phone calls punctuated this section.  Jim Norton and Bill Burr appeared as in-studio guests.  The show started with prank calls, followed by Norton promoting a fictional "Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook" with offensive jokes.

A Long Island woman won a MiFi after an explicit make-out session with Pat from Munaki, including licking his missing toe area.  Another woman licked and sucked on Pat's toes and the area of his toe amputation. This was accompanied by descriptions of the foot's smell and appearance.  The show continued with vulgar jokes and comments, further reactions to the Robert Blake trial (including racially charged remarks), and a confrontation with an angry audience member, Bernie, who stormed off.  Earl also made an appearance. The show ended with a chaotic "What Did We Learn Today?" segment, filled with vulgar language and jokes, a song, and further off-color comments.

[00:04:30]  palaver. Let's get the  show on the road.  ONA  party rock!  ONA party rock!  ONA party rock!  Hello, exactly!  Hello, exactly!  Let's do it!  I know.  Hello, exactly! 
[00:05:00]  How are you?  ONA!  The family member dies,  then you insult me. What the heck?  What the matter with you anyway?  ONA party rock!  You just mind your  peas and pews, buster, and remember  who you're dealing with.  Asshole!  Pardon my French,  but you're an asshole!  Ow! Ow! 
[00:05:30]  Ow! Ow! Ow!  And welcome to the  Open Anthony program!  Bueller!  Bueller!  Bueller!  Oh, yeah, there they are.  Live from  all the...  All the...  All the rock  cafe in New York City.  All the people that will be  drunk in  in no time.  Actually, I have an announcement  to make. 
[00:06:00]  Oh!  No liquor until  8 a.m.  Oh!  Why is your mic so far away  from your head?  I don't know.  I can barely hear you.  How's that?  You gotta put it right  in front of your face.  Ah, perfect.  Can you hear me out there?  You hear me?  I hear ya.  Great.  Oh, this is gonna be  a lot of fun.  We're just staring at a bunch  of nice people.  I heard they were out there  like very early  in the morning.  See, we can't hide  in the studio. 
[00:06:30]  They're looking at us  as we make fun of them.  I know.  Stop looking at us.  This is a hell of a crowd  for this early in the morning,  you know?  I'll say.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Good point.  Jimmy's just sitting  reading the paper.  That's great.  Is this good?  Can you hear?  Yeah, we can hear you.  Yeah, we like doing  our sound checks  on the air.  Well, when I said no,  how'd you know  I spoke, Dick?  Yeah, so this is our  first live broadcast 
[00:07:00]  in New York City,  I would have to say, right?  Yeah.  And this is quite a crowd  as we make the biggest  comeback in radio history.  I see some familiar faces  out there, Opie.  Like who?  I'm scanning the...  Well, come on.  Of course, Pat from Munaki.  You got Pat...  Well, what are you gonna do?  I'm here.  We should start by getting  a wireless mic out there  so we can say hi  to some of the freaks.  Have you seen Pat's CD?  Yeah, Pat was handing out  a CD.  I guess the line started 
[00:07:30]  around 5 a.m.  or something like that.  Yeah.  And Pat was out there  and he was handing out  CDs of his greatest hits  or something?  It's the worst of Pat  from Munaki.  Volume 1, I guess.  He's got ambitions.  You know?  I guess in the future  there'll be more  and more volumes.  He's got ambition  for a box set?  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah.  A little box set.  Why not?  Is the wireless microphone working?  Club Soda Kenny, everyone.  Way out there, yes.  That's Club Soda Kenny.  And he's got Pat from Munaki.  Hey, Pat. 
[00:08:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Still got all your nine toes?  I didn't take inventory  this morning,  but I believe so.  Well, well, you know.  I'm honored  that you used  my Photoshop there  from Wack Bag  on the cover.  I gave you a little credit  on the bottom.  I see that.  I would have sued you  for your nine toes  that you have left.  That means copyright infringement  for XM.  What can we hear on this?  This is great stuff.  All my wonderful  instant feedbacks  and some... 
[00:08:30]  Wait, it's a CD  of us reading  your instant feedbacks.  That, among other things,  my news from Munaki,  all kinds of stuff.  Great.  Some of your hysterical jokes  that got rave reviews  and...  Well, yes.  Anthony, we got a CD player here.  Let's play a track  from your CD.  Oh, okay.  Oh, any track  you recommend?  Uh...  Hmm.  No.  No, huh?  No?  That's why they're free.  How many tracks  are there on this thing? 
[00:09:00]  I think, like, uh...  Nine.  As many as his toes.  Put up, pump.  Thank you, Kenny.  Well, we should play  a short one here.  All right.  What's Ant's laugh?  You have a track  called Ant's Laugh.  No, a guy called in  and talked about Ant's Laugh.  Norton talked about, uh...  No, he thinks it's his  jiggly Italian cock.  But what does that  have to do with you?  Well, because he talked  about when I puked.  You were laughing.  Is it...  As long as there's  a mention of you  and you put it on there,  is that pretty much it?  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  What a tool.  That's what she said.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Good thing I had an airbag.  Oh, no, that's my stomach.  You just heard  track 16 and 17  before it's live.  The preview of volume 2.  The preview of the live CD.  My bomb will drop in March.  Live at Poudita.  What are you going to do? 
[00:10:00]  We'll try Ant's Laugh.  I guarantee you  it's going to bomb.  Let's try.  All right.  I guarantee you.  Let's give it a listen.  Every time...  Like that thing with Pat,  when you guys played the puke...  Yeah.  I don't...  I was losing my mind.  Anthony starts laughing  and you hear that.  I was losing my mind  when he was doing that.  I don't know why  a fat guy throwing up  is hysterically funny.  There it is.  There it is.  You know why? 
[00:10:30]  Because his laugh  is very genuine.  You know,  Anthony doesn't laugh  at a lot of things,  but when he does,  you just know  you're cracking him up  big time.  Yeah.  That would be it.  By the way,  I do...  I definitely know  why you enjoy Ant's Laugh so much.  Don't even go there.  Why?  I just...  It's contagious.  That's all there is to it.  All right.  You keep telling yourself that.  Whatever helps you,  put your head on the pillow  and doze off at night, sir. 
[00:11:00]  If it's because Ant's Laugh is contagious,  I think that you picture  his jiggly big Italian cock  in his pants  while he's laughing.  Jesus.  You got to go there?  Wow.  I'm speculating.  Damn.  Good show.  Have a good show tomorrow.  Not you.  All right.  Thank you, Scott.  Here's something  to help you bust a nut.  There you go.  That's it.  Wow.  Pass.  Yeah, look at him.  Look at him applauding that.  Pass from Munaki's here, guys.  Yes. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, wait.  They went right to the next track.  All right.  Well, that's a sample of  the worst of Pass from Munaki, Volume 1.  How many of these did you make?  I made by 15.  Oh, wow.  For all my fans.  And some left over.  Well, kind of working on it.  All right.  Hey, I have an impression.  A double impression.  Oh.  All right.  Michael Jackson smoking a joint  and Michael Jackson  with an eight-year-old boy. 
[00:12:00]  Did you have to stand up for that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because you had to bend over.  Oh, I got you.  He's bending over  because he's giving a blowjob  to a young boy.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh.  Wow, the crowd  is really turning on you now.  That probably would have worked better  if you had like a little teeny toe  in a roach clip.  You nailed me with that one.  Okay, terrific.  Oh, nailed.  Oh, he is awful.  All right, Kenny, enough of Pat from Munaki.  Let's hear for Pat. 
[00:12:30]  Very good, Pat.  Who else is here?  Who are some of the other freaks  from the show that are here?  Ricky, Ricky.  Ricky?  No, he's trying to get Ricky.  He did the get Ricky thing.  Are you actually sending him out for something?  No, he already went.  Got coffee.  Oh, that's Ricky, the intern  who never gets anything right.  Did he get it right there, Jimmy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Small coffee.  Oh, goody.  Your beatings are working.  Yeah.  Small coffee with skim milk 
[00:13:00]  and a little bit of his saliva.  Did my mic just go down?  Yeah, they're going down.  Whatever, it's fine.  Okay.  It'll work.  Are you going to fart for everyone today, Jimmy?  I'm sorry?  Are you going to be farting for everyone today?  Well, not like an event,  but if I have one,  I'm going to sneak it out.  Yeah, of course.  What's that?  Make sure it's in front of my mouth?  I do stand-up for a living, Steve.  I know.  Not with a headset on, Madonna.  That's a good point.  Oh, how's that?  Is that better? 
[00:13:30]  Oh, all right.  Because I was like that,  and I was trying.  Again, we like testing things.  It was on your goddamn chin.  Oh, no, you have to put the microphone  in front of your face  and talk into it.  All right, thank you.  I guess we should introduce  Martini Steve, of course, right there.  Oh, of course.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Is Martini Steve?  Martini Steve?  Is Martini Steve?  Sorry, I'm trying to hold the mic  a little bit low  because it's feeding back  because I'm right in front  of this goddamn speaker.  You're getting a little feedback,  aren't you?  Just a little.  Yeah.  Try holding it in front of your mouth. 
[00:14:00]  Fuck you.  Is the mic a little hot?  It's because Steve's holding it.  No flaming attire today?  The boots.  Oh, wow.  He's got his flaming boots on.  Jesus.  You've kind of calmed down  with the shirt.  Is that because spring is coming  and you don't need to stay  as warm as well?  Well, no.  Well, the flaming shirts  will be making a return  simply because they're not  as warm, ironically enough.  I just couldn't wear them  in the winter.  You haven't rotated them  through your laundry?  Yeah.  Maybe that's the problem?  Yeah, exactly.  Great. 
[00:14:30]  Also the creator  of the Ramon promos.  Yeah.  Ramon.  Apparently the only good ones, too.  Steve hates his fans.  Why don't you stand out there?  No, I don't.  What?  I'm trying not to feed back.  That's all.  I can't find a freaking spot  where these mics aren't feeding back.  That's all.  Right there?  What?  Right in the middle?  Oh, that's great.  I love this.  Oh, this isn't too awkward.  No, yeah, exactly.  It's like a fucking firing range.  Steve hates this.  He's like the center of attention.  Just stare at him. 
[00:15:00]  I know.  It's really...  It is awkward.  Just stare at Steve.  Are you a little nervous  with all these alcoholics  staring at you?  Yeah, it's like an AA meeting.  I'm supposed to confess something.  Is there some kind of law  that you can't drink  before eight in the morning?  New York State law.  Why was eight a good time?  Isn't that just still  too fucking early?  I mean, it's like seven.  No, if you're drinking seven,  you're real fucked up.  But eight,  that's a good time  to really start pounding them down.  Right when there's even more traffic  on the road,  things are going to hit.  The Paris has always sent you out 
[00:15:30]  on the road  when there's really no one out there  at six, seven in the morning.  But let's get good rush hour traffic  and then pound a few green beers down.  Do they do the green beer thing here?  They probably figure 8 a.m. is good  because by that time  your wife is kind of awake  and can get away from the beating  if you start giving it to her.  Oh, that's too rough.  This is going to be a long  four hours, motherfuckers.  Can't do a domestic violence joke  on Opie and Anthony  in front of a bunch of drunks  at the Hard Rock?  Cocksuckers.  And you know half these guys  are drunk already.  Of course they are.  And the other half are wife beaters. 
[00:16:00]  They had a few on the way in,  I'm sure.  Yeah, you don't see people  drinking out of brown paper bags.  You know, there's Starbucks coffee  out of a brown paper.  The guy's brown paper bagging it.  What do you got in there, my friend?  Rumpelmints.  Rumpelmints.  Oh, that's too early for that, though.  Some nice 7 a.m. heartburn.  He's like,  100 proof, dude!  Rumpelmints is great.  You drink it until you're fucked up.  You puke,  and it's like you mouthwashed.  It's like you used mouthwash.  You could puke and kiss 
[00:16:30]  the drunk girl you're with,  and she won't even notice.  You ever do the make-out  with the girl that puked?  When you're out?  Oh, shut up, man!  Like, we're the only ones.  Years ago,  like in junior high  or high school,  you go out,  and you're with some girl,  and you just start pounding down  hardcore,  really nasty booze or something.  They get all drunk.  You get drunk.  The girl pukes.  And you're still a young,  growing boy.  You want a little action.  That's why a little,  little vomit mouth  get in the way. 
[00:17:00]  Jimmy, no?  Never stop me.  I'm not the one who groaned.  They did.  I'm all for it.  More groaning from this crowd.  I'm all for fucking her  while she pukes.  That's right.  Get your face in the bowl,  stupid.  This way you can't testify.  Absolutely.  They're applauding that one,  Anthony.  Anthony.  You know after a few drinks,  they're going to be like,  murder the bitch!  Like nothing's going to shock them.  They're a little shocked  at the vomit thing  and the domestic violence.  Well, I think we're trying  to get to know each other here. 
[00:17:30]  They're staring at us.  We're staring at them.  Yeah.  After a while,  we're going to need the alcohol  to loosen up this party.  That's obvious.  How many more minutes  before we can start serving alcohol?  Someone's got to keep track of that.  42.  I see.  Someone's right on it.  I like that.  They know to the second.  That was Ben's liver  that yelled that out.  Where is Ben?  Is he herky and jerky?  He's on the phone.  What?  You're on the phone with Voss?  Okay.  Voss or the boss?  Oh, the boss.  Ugh. 
[00:18:00]  Are they still in town?  I don't know.  Or did they get out of here?  Wow, what a great meeting  we had yesterday.  For those of you listening,  yesterday we stopped the show  and had a meeting  with one of our big bosses.  Elo.  And then Hugh Pinero  actually stopped by  with one of the lawyers  and everything.  So we were speculating  that there's another  big XM deal going down  because they always end up  in New York  to go to these meetings.  So we thought  it was some big deal  and we find out 
[00:18:30]  perhaps it was golf.  Well, yeah,  it was signed.  It made the papers today.  Oh, it did make the papers.  Yeah, we're going to be  the exclusive home  of PGA Golf.  PGA Golf, people.  Yeah.  Making all the big deals  XM is.  The only thing  more exciting  than watching golf  is listening to it.  And commercial.  He's about 10 yards 
[00:19:00]  from the hole.  We're going to sit here  and watch as he putts.  And can we have  some silence out there  in the gallery, please?  That's what they're going to get.  That's exactly  what they're going to get.  Well, it will make  the coverage more interesting.  Yeah.  Hey, I noticed  that FedEx is out here.  Oh.  FedEx.  He's like a super fan.  He runs  OAVirus.com.  Oh, he does. 
[00:19:30]  For all your  O.P. and Anthony needs.  This is great.  How we could bring  the leaders  of the five message boards  together.  Discuss our differences.  That's it.  FedEx is a pimp.  Kenny, let FedEx  say hi on the radio.  We're changing the battery  on the wireless microphone.  We're changing  the battery already.  Why should anything  change when we're 
[00:20:00]  out on the road?  Why should it change?  Of course you're  changing the battery.  Of course.  The mic was on  for six minutes.  Of course you got  to change the battery.  What was it?  An old battery  that was in there?  No one thought  of changing the battery  before the show started.  Oh, really?  Is that it?  Nothing works here.  Been here seven years.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications  don't work.  I've been here 
[00:20:30]  for seven years.  I love that nut.  I wonder where he is.  Probably here today.  Well, we got lots to do.  We're going to give away  some my-fies.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  See?  That's popular.  They love the my-fies.  We were going to do  a whole puking contest,  but they didn't want us  to do that here  at the Hard Rock.  The Hard Rock frowns  on people just barfing  in their establishment.  Go figure that one out.  So we have asked you guys  what would you do  for a my-fi today. 
[00:21:00]  Do we have some suggestions?  Well, so far we got a few.  Where's the list  of suggestions?  If any girl has a suggestion  to drink out of  Norton's Mule,  that sounds like  a winner to me.  Yeah, I see a couple  of girls in the crowd.  I'm stunned.  Ooh, listen to that.  Ooh, a girl.  Glad you made it, ladies.  We have a pinball machine  being shipped in  as we speak.  It's definitely  a sausage factory, but  Club Soda Kenny  is going to take  your suggestions 
[00:21:30]  what you would do  for a my-fi today.  We're looking for  some really good suggestions.  So far we have a guy  that wants to do  the O.J. ass chug.  The O.J. ass chug?  What's that?  Will you drink alcohol  out of a ripped up  blonde throat?  Oh, they're loosening up.  You bet they are.  And then a couple guys  want to shave their heads  and maybe put an XM logo  or a WOW logo  in their head.  We got a suggestion  if you want to hear it. 
[00:22:00]  All right.  Right?  All right.  Pat's missing toe area.  I'll lick it for a my-fi.  Oh!  Oh!  God damn.  I know this is radio,  but can we get Pat  maybe front and center  to show everyone  the missing toe?  Oh.  Oh, here it is.  Wait a minute.  All right.  Hey, dude,  if you lick the toe,  you get the my-fi,  but what does Pat get  besides a raging hard-on?  Guys, don't be shy.  Gather around.  Get a good look. 
[00:22:30]  Hey, Kenny,  get in there  because the reaction  is going to be great.  I like how his head  has the shine.  Everyone is circling around  Pat from Minaki  to check out  the missing toe.  There it is.  Looks like a Flintstone.  He looks like  the Flintstones.  That's great.  He has a Flintstone foot.  It's a cartoon foot.  He lost a toe  stopping a car.  Wow.  People are taking  pictures of his foot.  They're going to-  Look at the hammers  that are going off.  It's like the paparazzi.  Oh, thank you.  No, I won't partake 
[00:23:00]  in any of your  rumplements  or whatever it is.  100 proof, Anthony.  100 proof.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  They all took-  Go into town.  They all took pictures  of Pat's famous  missing toe.  So they'll be  photoshopping it  and it'll be up  on all the message boards.  All right, so we don't have-  Well, shuffle off  to Buffalo.  We don't have any  great ideas yet, really.  Shuffle off as big  as a buffalo.  Well, well.  Another guy wants  to take some lime juice  in the eye.  We could do better  than that, you guys.  If you have an idea-  If you have an idea, 
[00:23:30]  you know-  Is someone farting up here?  So did Kenny.  Is someone farting up here?  This chick wants  to say something.  Shit.  Oh, with the feedback there, Kenny.  I said I'd have sex  with Obie for a my-fi.  You're not good enough.  Wow.  Obie!  Obie!  Obie!  Obie!  Obie!  There you go.  Is there a back room somewhere?  Throw her a-bang in! 
[00:24:00]  Anyone else  with a suggestion?  Something they'll do  for a my-fi?  Just raise your hand,  Club Soda Kenny  will search you out.  And you can think about it  for a while.  We're going to be here  until 11 a.m.  A guy in a Jets jersey.  Jets jersey.  Stick my finger  in Patty's ass.  I don't think  she'd go for that.  Is Stalker Patty  even here yet?  Oh, she's way in the back.  Club Soda Kenny.  All right.  I have to be  at Godiva at 9.30  so I get to show up early.  Hello.  I'm off today. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, you're off?  Yeah, Thursday's  my day off.  Wow, what a coincidence.  It's on St. Patty's Day.  Yep.  It's your day.  And I'm not even Irish.  Shut up.  You want a little Irish in you?  Shut up.  It's Stalker Patty Day.  Hey, Stalker Patty  going to do some live  scientific experiments today  for everybody?  Yeah, maybe she could do  that little experiment.  No, I was just playing around  with the concept.  That's all.  Just playing around.  Just make sure I knew 
[00:25:00]  what I was talking about  when I posted.  Imagine if she  harnessed that energy  seriously.  Would you guys like  to see Patty  do a live  scientific experiment?  Yeah.  Of course they would.  I would like to see her  do the ones  you described  in the email, Anthony.  Come on, come on.  Where we take an object  that's lighter than Patty  and push her both  of them off the building.  I stink.  Can I throw her  across the room?  Fucking early.  Patty, come on.  Here she comes  front and center.  Stalker Patty, everybody. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, yes.  We saw her naked.  Look at that  ant-like thorax.  You are a little  ant body.  All we need is  pig blood from the rafters.  We want Patty  to walk us through  the experiments  you did in her apartment, Anthony.  Yeah, Patty.  Why don't you grab  it was just  take certain things  like my beanie babies  and things that  rely on just drops  and see what would happen.  You're 50 years old,  you freak. 
[00:26:00]  You got beanie babies?  Yeah, I have  a stuffed animal collection.  You got a body  like a beanie baby.  Well, we need  two objects  that Patty could drop.  Uh-huh.  How about a beanie baby  and your social security check?  Fucking old weirdo.  I don't think  there's going to be  any social security  left when I'm old enough.  All right,  that's probably  a little political statement.  Now she's going to go  into politics.  That's nice.  Yeah, two objects  she could drop.  Hopefully one is a grenade  without the pin in it. 
[00:26:30]  Another one,  a vial of nitroglycerin.  An anvil in your hymen.  Which hits the ground first?  Her uterus.  Too bad we can't  drop Pat's toe.  Ooh, that would be  the heavy object.  Well, it's fat.  Anything, what do we got?  Ooh, a cup?  Oh, a lemon?  All right, a lemon, Patty.  Here we go.  It's science with Patty  here early morning.  Look at what we got to do  before the alcohol  starts flowing.  This bullshit.  All right.  All right, Patty, 
[00:27:00]  explain this.  Explain what you're  going to do for everybody.  Well, I don't know.  I just took a lighter object  and a heavier object  and see if they felt  the same time.  Oh, wow.  She just dropped it  out of nowhere.  What a pro you are  at the build up  and the crescendo  and the payoff.  Yeah, Patty, do it again.  You've got to explain.  Yeah, Patty,  let the crowd see you  bend over and pick up  that lemon.  Oh, hot.  Come on.  Pick it up with your  big ant mandible.  No, no, no, no.  No, not like that.  Bend over at the waist. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Look at the cameras  going off, you freaks.  50-year-old ass.  Nice.  All right.  Now, Patty, explain.  You've got to  step by step  you've got to explain this.  Here.  What about facing  the audience?  Yeah, how about  facing the audience?  And explain what  you're going to do.  All right.  I pretended the object  was inside of something  to see if maybe  they both fell  at different rates  inside the elevator. 
[00:28:00]  That voice.  So I just did that.  All right, Patty.  Now hold them both up  at the same height.  What do you got  in your hand, Patty?  You've got to explain.  You've got a very light.  A cup and a lemon.  I like the cup, though.  It's an O.P.  I'd love to keep  the cup.  Well, those are the cups  we were giving away  at Mardi Gras.  That drunkenness.  All right, go ahead.  That'll...  That stayed inside.  That means the elevator  and the person  full is one unit.  Oh, God.  Oh.  I didn't think... 
[00:28:30]  Well, now we know  you read the boards.  Oh, she's a regular...  You know what?  Alvin Einstein.  You know what?  For that, I think  she should wear  the Krusty Mask  and crawl across the floor.  And can I make a point?  Did we bring  the Krusty Mask?  All right,  we'll have it here soon?  All right.  The lemon is actually  heavier than the cup.  So that works perfectly  if there's an 8,000-pound person  in an elevator.  The lemon is the size  of her brain. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, I have a brain.  I took an IQ test online  and I got 135.  Yeah, but there was  a decimal point in it.  No.  Wow, what kind of questions, Patty?  Oh, I don't know.  Like, you know.  Yeah, good one.  About how to hold  a microphone?  You got a 135 IQ.  Well, that's what I scored.  It doesn't mean  I actually have it.  I just scored well 
[00:29:30]  on this particular test.  Well, what did...  You know, it just showed,  like, this is to this  and that is to that  and stuff like that,  you know.  IQ stuff.  Yeah.  Like, this segment  is to radio  and then they show  Arthur Ashe's blood  is to sex.  Yeah.  All right,  we're going to take a break  because this is going  nowhere with Patty.  Let's hear it for  Stalker Patty.  Yeah, get back  to your corner, Patty. 
[00:30:00]  Still looking for  what you will do  for a MyFi.  If you're, you know,  going to come over  to the Hard Rock,  make sure you search us out  and, you know,  see Club Soda Kenny  with what you would do  for a MyFi.  And we're only 30 minutes  away from drinking.  Yeah.  Why don't we play  a Stephen Lynch Irish song  as we go to break here.  It's Opie and Anthony  broadcasting live  from the Hard Rock Cafe  in New York City  with all our freaks.  Thanks for coming out, guys.  We greatly appreciate it.  We'll be here  until 11 a.m. 
[00:30:30]  In the meantime,  let's listen to  a Stephen Lynch song  and we'll be back.  Hips in a pink supple ass  and make her your wife  and love her  with love so true.  Now some rivers run high,  some rivers run low  and her river runs red  and she's starting her flow  and it's called menstruation.  Here's what it means to you.  You will notice  her bloomers are spotty at first 
[00:31:00]  and back her ovarian down.  Time's gonna burst.  Son, don't be afraid.  It's a natural thing.  Just wad up some cotton  and hand or a string  and put the old linens  on top of the bed.  Get out of the house  and go down  to the old pub instead.  Hundreds of years old.  That's why bloomers.  Aye.  Aye.  She'll retain her water.  Her breasts will be tender.  Say something nice  and you're sure to offend her. 
[00:31:30]  Get out of the house  and go down  to the old pub instead.  She'll want to make love  if you do.  You're a fool.  You'll only end up  with a bloody old tool.  Now get out of the house  and go down  to the old pub instead.  She'll want you  to sample  the fruit of her loins  but son,  it'll taste like  some old rusty coin.  So turn off the light  and take off your hat  and drop to your knees.  Say a prayer to St. Pat  that'll give you  the strength  to get out of the bed  and for Ireland's sake 
[00:32:00]  go down  to the old pub instead.  I feel a solo coming on.  Oh, really?  Perhaps right here, Anthony.  Very good.  Now the pub is the place  where the lads are a-meeting  when the moon is full  and the gals are a-bleeding  the Catholic,  the Protestant,  even the pagan 
[00:32:30]  the pub is the place  when your lady is ragging  so drink of your pint, boys  and thank your shamrocks  that as menfolk  we don't have to bleed  from our c**  and that we can escape  from the lady in red  and get out of the house  and go down  to the old pub instead.  Down to the old pub  instead.  Nice.  Thank you, my lads.  Thank you so much.  Raise your glass.  Funny good. 
[00:33:00]  Like sands  through the hourglass,  so is the O&A virus.  I miss my one ex  because we're such a one ex-girlfriend  I'm really good friends with still.  For the new audience,  you've got to explain  your first date with her  because that's a classic story.  It's actually kind of sweet.  Sweet.  We met on the Opie and Anthony show.  People know.  It doesn't matter.  I was driving my car  and Opie and Anthony  had a girl in the studio  that kind of liked being slapped  during sex.  Remember you guys  called out on the air  and said,  Jim, if you're listening,  call in.  This was before  I was like a daily regular 
[00:33:30]  and I called in  and went into the studio  and met her  and she was hot  and I slapped her  a few times on the air  and we all laughed  and then she and I went  and I said,  come on,  let's go to the Comedy Cellar tonight.  Oh.  So this is a first date.  Sure.  Kind of like a first date.  So we go down  to the Comedy Cellar  and we're upstairs  in the Olive Tree  and she's like,  can I borrow 20 bucks?  All right.  I'm like,  I wonder what she needs that for  but I used to partake  in certain activities  and I'm like,  I think I know  what she needs that for  and I probably won't be  seeing her again  for the rest of the evening  but I'm a good sport  so I said,  here's 20  and she comes back 
[00:34:00]  about an hour later  and I'm like,  I couldn't believe  she even came back.  I'm like,  what happened?  And she's like,  wow,  I tried to buy Coke  in Washington Square Park  but the guy held a knife  to my throat  and took the money.  So I think she had a water  and a chicken kebab  and then I dropped her off  and we had oral sex  in the car  and I dated her  for nine months  after that.  She's trying to buy Coke.  You know how it is  on a first date  you go out to school  with Coke  from a Negro  in Washington Square Park  and he holds a knife  to your throat  and takes the money  then you come back.  I love that.  I'm back,  you silly goose.  Is that a great first date? 
[00:34:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  What a lunatic.  Oh, she's nuts.  And then Jimmy,  but she's funny.  She's like really  a funny person.  Dude, she's great.  She's a lot of fun.  She really is a lot of fun.  But then you realize  she had a problem.  Yeah, five minutes  after she walked back  and said I tried to buy Coke.  Well, no, no.  Well, when she was  getting up in the middle of the night  and going to the bathroom  with her pocketbook.  Oh, yeah.  We had to go to a wedding.  We had to go to a wedding  one morning,  one day  and at three in the morning  she's running,  this is when I lived in Jersey,  she's running into my bathroom  with her purse.  I'm like,  do you understand  that I'm in recovery? 
[00:35:00]  You think I don't know  what you're doing in there?  Yeah, what are you doing?  She's like,  no, I'm just going to the bathroom.  I'm like,  no, you're not.  You're like a chatty Cathy doll.  It's 3.30 a.m.  You're grinding your teeth  and you're running  into the toilet  with your purse.  This is not Port Authority  we're sleeping.  You can leave the pocketbook.  Opie and Anthony,  the virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony,  XM202.  Hello, hello.  Hello.  Let a police call  but it don't want to fly.  It's everything I wish I didn't know. 
[00:35:30]  It's a kill.  Give me something.  I can see you.  I can see you.  And we're back  with the Opie and Anthony program  live from the Hard Rock Cafe  in New York City.  The crowd has grown, Anthony.  St. Paddy's Day.  Oh, ONA Party Rock.  Before we get back into the show,  I just got to make  another announcement.  23 minutes before 
[00:36:00]  we can drink, everybody.  Almost there.  Almost there.  Then they will just stare at us.  They'll be at the bar.  They'll be socializing.  They'll be partying.  Fucked up.  They'll be fucked up by 9 a.m.  This is a tough day  for drinkers, man.  Because unless you keep going,  you get that  noon hangover thing going.  Which is really bad.  Nothing worse than  a hangover at noon.  So you got to keep, you know,  keep it going  until you either pass out 
[00:36:30]  in early evening  or the real hardcore pros.  Those are the ones you know  that are walking down the street,  still going to the bars  at like 11 o'clock  that have been there all day.  Like, those are your animals.  Any of those people  think they're going to be  a few?  Wow, only a couple.  A lot of people are like,  no, I'm going to pass out  pretty early.  I thought you were giving  advice to the professionals,  but it seems like  there's a lot of beginners  out there.  And this guy's wearing a skirt.  It's a kilt, my man.  It's a kilt, bro.  Tammy, it's called a kilt,  you idiot.  It's called a kilt  unless it's on a tranny. 
[00:37:00]  Then it's a skirt.  That's right.  Daddy.  I think you're daddy.  Hello, genderless one.  And you have to have  a lot of confidence  to wear the kilt,  even on, say, Patty's Day.  I got a huge pair of balls, too.  Oh.  Jeepers.  Well, no one here  wants to see them.  How about if I show those  for my fight?  Oh.  Um, no.  No.  Well, why don't we ask  the crowd, Anthony?  You know, it is  the people's radio show.  Does anyone want to see  this guy's big, hairy balls? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  No, no.  All right, it's official.  Thank God.  No.  All right, can I just have  a my-fi for the embarrassment, then?  Um.  Should we give him a my-fi?  Nice.  I got a kilt on,  for God's sake.  So what?  Wow, you're wearing a kilt  on St. Paddy's Day.  Ooh.  Cold figure.  What a nut.  Hey-o.  Wear a white hood  on Martin Luther King Day,  then you get a my-fi.  Hey-o.  Yeah.  Have you been to  the nude beach lately? 
[00:38:00]  Are you the guy?  Yeah, I'm the dude.  All right, explain  in front of everybody.  All right, listen.  Uh-oh.  There's a nude beach  out in Long Island.  It's, uh...  Well, let's not tell everybody...  Hold on, let's start with this.  Was I nude?  Were you...  Uh, no, of course.  Okay, thank you.  All right, but what you were  doing was worse.  You were trolling around  the nude beach  looking for a nude beach.  I don't know.  I'd have more respect for you  if your balls were hanging out, bro.  You were the one...  Wait, is that her?  Yeah, that's my wife.  I saw her naked.  This girl has...  Yeah, that's...  She's shy. 
[00:38:30]  This girl has an amazing body.  That's why I married her, bro.  I was jogging through the...  This is going to sound...  Jogging my ass.  You were looking back and forth.  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  I was jogging through the nude beach.  That is the truth, okay?  All right.  And I know this isn't going to sound  good at all, but whatever.  And all of a sudden,  I hear some Metallica music,  so I look up toward the beach.  And all of a sudden,  you recognize me, right?  Yep, yep.  And I kept running  because I'm like,  oh, God, why is this guy  looking at me?  And then you scream opium.  I'm like, okay,  he's a fan of the radio show.  So I come over  and I start talking to this guy  and he's freaking out  that he's meeting me. 
[00:39:00]  See, you shouldn't have come over.  Why would you go over?  A naked man's calling my name.  I got to get over there.  That's what I'm saying.  It's not going to sound good at all.  I know.  But he was a fan of the show  and I'm like, oh, jeez.  Chava logs.  Chava logs.  Big fire on the beach  full of chava logs.  So I walk over,  I start talking to this guy.  He's freaking out  because you're a big fan of the show.  Huge fan.  Huge fan.  Was he a really big fan of the show?  Or just a...  No.  Sorry.  I got bigger when I saw Opie. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, God.  That tussleable hair.  So it was really awkward.  You're standing up talking to me.  Is that your wife or girlfriend?  It's my wife.  She's completely naked  and she has some of the nicest breasts  I've ever seen in my life, by the way.  Beautiful.  There you go.  And all of a sudden,  like, you introduced me to your wife  and she's just...  I mean, she was practically,  no offense,  spread eagle naked on the beach  and I'm like,  the only thing I can say is,  wow, you're lovely.  You know?  It was the most awkward moment ever.  You're lovely, you said? 
[00:40:00]  Wow.  That's exactly what he said, too.  He was at a total loss for words.  He was drooling.  He was stumbling.  I rubbed some lotion on your snatch.  She's covered up right now.  I mean, you've got to see this girl's body.  It was amazing.  And then I'm like,  dude,  this is going to someday be on the air.  I was hoping not in front of, like,  what,  300 people in a fucking bar.  I was hoping I could hide behind the studio  on this one.  I said,  you look at me right now  and remember that I have clothes on right here.  Right?  All right.  For the record,  you had clothes on,  but what were you still doing 
[00:40:30]  strolling the beach?  Now,  this guy was naked?  He was naked, yeah.  How did you talk to him completely naked?  Eye contact, my brother.  You just kept looking?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he looks very, very uncomfortable.  I got to tell you.  No shit.  And then I'm like,  I just wanted out of there  and I took off  and I wrote it in my little book of things  to talk about  when we finally got back on the air, so.  You got it here, bro.  And now he's got the kilt on.  So if anyone else wants to see his big hairy balls,  just raise your hand  and I'm sure he'll give you a flash.  Come on, guys.  It's my five, man.  You guys go to the nude beach a lot 
[00:41:00]  in the summer, yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It's a natural way to go.  All over tan kind of thing?  Yeah, all over rain.  You know what?  If she shows what I saw,  I'll give you a mi-fi.  Oh, wow.  That had to be up to her.  For a simple wowing?  I don't think she's down for that.  Yeah, no, no, no.  Isn't that odd?  She can lay on a beach completely naked.  There's no problem.  But getting up in front of a crowd  and flashing is a little too much.  Well, it's a fucking sword fight over here.  I mean, come on.  Well, all right.  Well, welcome to the Hard Rock. 
[00:41:30]  And it's good to see you guys with clothes on.  Oh, thanks.  I also see Francine in the audience somewhere.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Francine.  How are you?  You guys think Stalker Patty's stupid?  Oh, sorry.  She's listening to us.  Way to make the guests feel comfortable.  She's here in the room, Opie.  Why would this be any different than our regular show?  All right, Club Soda Kenny's getting her on the stage.  In front, in front there.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Francine. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Morning.  Hey, you know, she's a stand-up comic, Anthony.  You want her to do maybe like a minute?  She could do a little bit of it.  I could do a minute?  You could do a minute for a national audience.  And how many people are here?  I don't know.  Cute as a button with the same IQ.  Okay, I'll do a minute.  You'll do a minute?  Yeah, get up.  Do your act.  All right, stand in the middle.  By the way, 15 minutes before we could all drink.  15 minutes.  And I guarantee we should have waited for everyone to be really hammered 
[00:42:30]  before we had Francine doing stand-up.  If we were really tasteless, I'd start doing some auctioneer stuff right now.  But I'm not even going to go there, though.  I'm not even because I have more class than that.  Anthony.  Yeah.  That's cool.  Hey, that isn't nice, and I know.  That's why I'm not doing it.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Eric just gave me the official countdown to when we could drink now. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, goody.  We have star of the time.  The timer.  All right, Francine, why don't you give them a little bit of your comedy?  Yeah, give them a little something.  Ladies and gentlemen, Francine.  So I've started doing something really weird lately.  I started crotch staring.  What bastards.  You've got to give her a chance.  You can't heckle her set-ups.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:43:30]  Thank you, Eric.  Yeah, give her a chance.  Okay, so I've started crotch staring.  I walk around just staring at guys junk, and I have no idea how it is I started doing it.  But I think I've figured it out.  You ever on the subway, women, and you're sitting down, you know, and there are these two guys in front of you, and they're talking about work and stuff like that.  And one guy just keeps doing this one move as they're sitting down.  And he keeps talking to his friend and just going like this the entire train ride. 
[00:44:00]  And he does it.  And you just know that if this guy did not have clothes on, he'd be cock-slapping you the entire train ride.  He's like my new joke.  That's your opener?  That's my newest joke.  You've got to open with something.  Move it.  She opened with a new joke.  There's definitely balls there, either that or a complete lack of thinking.  Try another one that you've done before.  Yeah, get a confident joke. 
[00:44:30]  Go ahead and you know that it works.  Go right for your stairway to heaven.  See the new stuff.  Well, I've got to think now, because now they...  One more joke.  Come on.  Don't panic on us.  She's not.  She doesn't care.  No!  Oh, my God.  I'm bombing.  I don't even know what to talk about.  She's freezing up like Cindy Brady at that contest on TV.  Baton Rouge, Francine.  Baton Rouge.  Come on.  You can do it.  All right, guys.  Be quiet. 
[00:45:00]  I've got to think now.  You've thrown me off.  Uh-oh.  Wow.  Uh-oh.  Francine's trying to think.  She's got to think.  I want to...  This is a photo op.  She's trying to think.  Save your pictures until you start seeing the smoke.  I'm lost for words.  Just do your act.  Like, what would you normally say if you were lost?  Yeah, what would you do?  It's a comic strip.  It's like 11 o'clock.  Yeah.  You've got to know another joke besides the new one that bombed.  Well, I'm lost now. 
[00:45:30]  You're lost?  Yeah.  You're in Manhattan.  Go.  Yeah.  How about the joke about Puerto Ricans you do?  Okay.  He was actually talking to me, Francine.  All right.  Go ahead, Francine.  But I think they've already heard the show, so they've probably heard all my good stuff.  No, no.  Let it rip.  I only have, like, five minutes worth of stuff.  Well, do something that you feel is good.  It doesn't matter if you're on the show already.  It doesn't matter if you did it already.  Just do it.  Do your strongest joke right now. 
[00:46:00]  Francine.  Come on.  There you go.  See?  The crowd's back on your side.  All right.  All right.  All right.  So, growing up, I was a really ugly kid.  And the reason why I knew I was really ugly is because I had this really cute little brother.  And everywhere we went, people would only comment on him.  And they'd come up to my mom and be like, oh, my God, he's so adorable.  He's so cute.  Just look at him.  And then they'd look at me and they'd be like, well, well, what's this? 
[00:46:30]  Well, what is it?  Can I pet it?  Does it bite?  What an animal crowd.  I love it.  Do the one that ends, you put Velcro on the ceiling.  Oh, that's not one of yours.  I'm sorry.  I mixed that up.  That's someone else's. 
[00:47:00]  I didn't do that one, Anthony.  I'm sorry.  Wrong comic.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Let's hear it for Francine.  Let's hear off the hook.  Ladies and gentlemen, Francine.  Oh, don't feel so bad, Francine.  You've done good.  You're not going to cry, are you?  No.  There's no crying in comedy.  All right.  Maybe if we give her a few minutes and she puts the material together a little bit later  on, because you kind of caught her off guard.  She just said, you walk in, say, go up and do material. 
[00:47:30]  Maybe give her a few minutes to kind of get her thoughts together.  In a few minutes, she'll forget that she was even here.  Yeah.  Give old goldfish brain a few minutes.  We're down to 10 minutes before we can start drinking.  10 minutes.  There was something else.  I like her Jiffy Pop hat that she's wearing.  By the way, for the people listening in their cars and stuff, we're going to do a real show  starting at 8 when we can start drinking and stuff.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  We're going to cover some of the big news of the day. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  We're going to talk about Robert Blake.  We're going to have Club Soda Kenny doing the news, all sorts of stuff.  Plus, you know, still looking for what you guys would do for a MiFi.  We're taking suggestions, yeah.  It's got to be good ones.  You know.  Not showing us your hairy man balls.  How many people heard the show where Stalker Patty crawled across the floor in the Krusty  the Clown mask?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Those eggs stink.  Really?  Oh, they smell like your ass, Jimmy.  Sorry. 
[00:48:30]  Wait, Stalker Patty's coming up.  She might do this again.  Of course she will.  This might be worth the MiFi if we could get a really hot girl to, like, do this live at  the Hard Rock Cafe.  Oh, hot girl?  We got Patty.  Patty, step it up a little bit.  Jesus.  You know, just trotting along.  There she is.  We're trying to turn Club Kenny's mic back on.  We got it?  Hi.  Kenny, you should be on, right?  What do you want me to do?  Come on, Patty.  It's a live show.  Move it. 
[00:49:00]  God, Patty.  I'm just thinking that maybe we could reenact what happened in the studio for everybody.  You got to move faster.  Make believe someone kicked over your anthill and starts scurrying.  You know how they do that?  They're moving real fast.  Pick up something twice, ten times your body weight.  Patty, would you be willing to reenact what you did in the studio?  Uh, you mean, uh...  Yeah.  Yeah, putting the crusty clown mask on.  Yeah, okay.  I'll put the mask on. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  But can I keep my clothes on?  After you do the little thing, yeah.  No one will see you getting changed, though.  They're tight, you know.  I'll say they are.  Your what is tight?  Yeah.  Her jeans are tight.  It's not the only thing tight on her.  Yeah.  Still a virgin, by the way, if anyone didn't know that.  She's 50 years old, and she's a virgin.  50 in a couple months.  Yeah, I'm going to set a world record. 
[00:50:00]  Well, I think we could talk her into something here.  How about topless?  Oh, that's easy.  Topless will take you out from the wings.  You crawl across the floor with the crust of the clown mask on.  Everyone gets their photo op, and that way her knees won't get hurt either.  What do you think, Patty?  Is she walking away, or is she going to do this?  She'll do it.  Right in front of the stage here, Patty.  This is your runway, like a beauty queen.  Someone said they'd rather see Jimmy naked. 
[00:50:30]  Do you guys want to see Stark or Patty do this?  Yeah.  Even the people yelling no kind of mean, yeah.  If she's going to do it, I'll look.  Wow, she has no problem just taking her shirt off.  She's a real go-getter these days.  This is the new and improved Patty.  The new slut Patty.  All right, here's our first flash of the day, Anthony.  Oh, the first wow is Patty.  Listen to the reaction.  Do you wear a bra Patty at all, ever? 
[00:51:00]  A training bra.  I hate them.  I hate them.  Nice.  Oh, wow.  She's got a wife beater on.  Oh, my God.  It's the first time that a wife beater hasn't looked sexy on a woman.  Please put the mask on first.  Putting on the Krusty the Clown mask.  All right, guys.  She needs some encouragement.  How is that shirt coming off with the mask on first?  No, you should take the wife beater off first. 
[00:51:30]  The wife beater?  Yeah, we're filming a lot of this stuff, by the way, for the websites.  Yeah, so you at home will be able to share in this experience.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, she disrobes as sexually as the scenes in Schindler's List when the girl will take  her clothes off.  And she has a similar body.  Ah!  Yeah, Patty.  That's funny.  Rock.  Oh, that's funny.  I am essential to the war effort.  Your possessions will meet you there?  Anthony, the Krusty the Clown mask is on. 
[00:52:00]  If you have a digital camera, you might want to step up.  You will be giving back your wife beater when you get to the family camp.  All right, you guys, here we go.  Here's a photo op, another Opie and Anthony photo op.  All right.  Make sure she doesn't, Kenny, make sure she doesn't fall.  No, no, no, no, you've got to crawl.  You've got to, Kenny, set her up nice over there.  You guys ready for this or what, huh?  Make sure she doesn't fall off the stage.  That's 50-year-old.  No, get that on your hands and knees.  All right.  There you go, Patty.  There you go.  He's topless with the Krusty the Clown mask. 
[00:52:30]  He's ready to crawl across the stage.  We have dozens and dozens of cameras flashing as we speak.  Ready?  That's right.  All right.  Wow.  Ice cans.  And go.  That's great.  In this experiment, Patty proves her dignity can fall as quickly as TWA Flight 800.  Wow.  That's, yeah.  That's right.  Back the other way.  There you go. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, people don't know what to think of this, Anthony.  Oh, wow.  We just like sharing with you guys.  We had to see this in the studio, so.  Uh, I'm going to sue.  I don't think, uh, I don't think they.  She's got some sexy bloomers on, I can see.  Yeah.  Bloomers.  Bloomers.  Oh, wow.  She's done?  Yeah.  The shirt's going back on?  The crowd didn't even go crazy.  No, I don't think they liked that one.  Did you guys like that one?  No, huh?  Nah.  Nah.  Is there any hot girl out there that just wants to wow to get the bad taste out of our 
[00:53:30]  mouths, or what?  You know what's odd?  At about 9 o'clock, 90% of these guys would do her.  After an hour's worth of drinking, hey, this chick's hot.  Put the Krusty mask back on.  Wow, Patty, very good.  You are a different gal than you were when we first got to New York, that's for sure.  You're older, still a virgin, but, man.  How did that feel, Patty?  Well, you know, for 50 years old, I think it's very good. 
[00:54:00]  Uh-oh.  Very brave.  Very brave.  Patty, you're kind of bummed.  You were hoping for a better reaction, huh?  No.  Patty, for years you've seen girls take off their tops at live events, and you just heard  the crowd cheering like crazy.  Were you a little disappointed at the reaction to you being topless?  No.  No?  I'm not 30 years younger.  All right.  I don't know.  She really got no reaction. 
[00:54:30]  Actually, I'm more of a sport than anything.  A sport, huh?  Yeah.  All right, sport.  Get off the stage.  Wait, Patty, Patty.  Wow.  Sexual kryptonite.  There she goes.  All right, Anthony, we're broadcasting live from the Hard Rock Cafe.  Thanks for coming out, guys.  What do we got?  Less than three minutes before the bar opens.  Wow. 
[00:55:00]  It is now post-time.  Almost there.  What are you guys starting with?  The beers?  Are you going to go hot and heavy right at the beginning with shots?  Yeah?  A lot of people, they're maniacs, hoping.  Just going to sit down.  Boy, that's going to be a bitch at the bar, huh?  Getting a drink.  When you all come running over there like a riot.  Poor bartender.  How many bartenders back there?  What do we got?  Two?  Two bartenders and all these people. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, you poor bastards.  Be nice.  Be sure to take care of them.  Tip very goodly.  Because I like saying they're going to be working very hard.  I don't know what I want.  Do I want a beer at this hour?  Yeah, why not?  I don't know.  Anthony, you definitely want a beer.  I don't know.  I was thinking maybe a Bloody.  Oh.  Those are good.  No, Bloody Mary.  Not like this.  That means something different for Jimmy.  Yeah.  Wait there, my glass has a string in it. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, they're oohing again.  Wow.  A little tampon joke and they all go to hell.  Should I get you, gentlemen, a beverage so you can toast right at 8 o'clock?  Oh, that'd be good.  Well, I'll have an absolute Bloody Mary.  Wow.  Okay.  I'll just do a beer.  Okay.  Hey, Kenny, before you go to the bar, though, Kenny's been trying out his new joke on everyone  as we were preparing for today's show.  He certainly was.  And it's an Irish joke.  You want to tell it now, Kenny? 
[00:56:30]  Well, I got a couple Irish jokes in honor of St. Patrick's Day.  You might know them.  What's the difference between an Irish wedding and an Irish funeral?  One less drunk.  Kenny, back off the mic a little bit.  Oh, I'm sorry.  So overzealous.  A little bit.  Where does an Irish family go on vacation?  To a different bar.  Bring back Francine.  And then there was two Irish guys walking by a police station, and they saw a sign that 
[00:57:00]  read, two blacks wanted for rape.  So one Irish guy says to the other, you know the blacks get the best jobs.  Oh, my God.  With that, the bar is now open.  It's open after the broadcast of live Hard Rock Cafe in the heart of New York City between  7th and Broadway.  We'll be here until 11 a.m.  Still trying to figure out what these fine folks will do for a MiFi.  We've got three of them to give away.  Quick break, and we will continue with the show. 
[00:57:30]  Drink up.  Hello?  Hello.  Is Tim there?  Who?  Tim.  I'm not open yet, my friend.  12 o'clock.  We open.  Oh, Christ.  Hello?  Hello.  Is Al there?  Al, uh, Al Winger?  No.  Koholik.  Al who?  Koholik.  Al Koholik.  Al Koholik.  Al Koholik. 
[00:58:00]  Don't know anybody by that name.  Okay, thank you.  All right.  Hello.  Hello?  Yes.  Is this a two bar?  Yeah.  Yeah, I wonder if you could help me out.  I'm one of a Phil Myers.  M-I-Z-A Myers.  Phil Myers.  Myers, yeah.  Phil Myers.  Phil Myers.  I'm here.  Nobody by that name.  He's not there?  No.  Okay, thank you. 
[00:58:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Is this a two bar in Jersey City?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'd like to know if you could tell me if there's an Al Kill You there?  Who?  Al Kill You.  Al Kill You?  Yeah.  Kill You.  Right.  What's his name?  Al Kill You.  I spell it out the other way now.  Send me.  Oh, okay.  K-I-L-L-E-U.  Al Kill You.  Al Kill You. 
[00:59:00]  Al Kill You.  No, nobody by that name.  Oh, uh, listen.  You know, I'm from Clifton.  I'm not from Jersey City.  I'm supposed to meet a few guys there, you know.  Uh, could you call...  Uh, how about Stanley Payne?  Is Stanley Payne there, you know?  Stanley Schreiber?  Stanley who?  Stanley Payne.  Hello?  Hello?  Stanley Payne.  What are you trying to kid me now?  No.  Let's not help you. 
[00:59:30]  You want to hear you kid me around, eh?  What?  Listen, you fucking bum.  You want to kid me, you motherfucker?  I'll come there and kick your fucking mouth up.  Listen, why'd you go out and fuck your mother?  I'll fuck your mother, you stupid son of a...  Why'd you come down here and have a little Nazi and come down and tell me that?  I'll come down here.  I'll break your fucking head up.  I'll give you a hundred dollars to buy it.  A hundred dollars.  You don't even get no hundred dollars.  Well, listen, you fucking motherfucker up.  Come over here.  Come over here. 
[01:00:00]  When I'm getting you.  Come over here.  I'll show you my age, what I'll do to you.  Yeah.  I'll cut your fucking balls out.  You fucking fets.  You motherfucker, you reflap.

[01:01:30]  Rock, rock.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program,  broadcasting live from the Hard Rock Cafe.  Yeah.  Starting to sound, it looks like a party, Anthony.  The bar is open. We're having a good time.  We'll be here until 11 a.m.  We're giving out my fives.  Also, these T-shirts we're handing out,  we're not selling them.  And, you know, just make sure you see Megan  and grab yourself an O.P. and Anthony T-shirt.  Yeah, someone thought we were selling them.  A few people. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Scrape together a couple of bucks off of you guys.  Excuse me?  Yes.  Somebody said they would eat a cigar for a MiFi.  Is that good enough?  Cigar?  That's pretty good.  That's pretty good.  Is there anyone out there that could beat that?  If you can, just raise your hand.  Club sort of, Kenny, we'll find you.  Who else?  Only if it's the cigar that Steve McQueen is smoking.  Oh, that's the guy with the cigar.  Anybody else?  Anybody else have something for a MiFi?  Come on, step up, handsome.  Let's go.  What do you want to do? 
[01:02:30]  No, you said anybody else.  Cigar for a MiFi.  No, stupid.  You've got to do something to win a MiFi.  Fucking idiot.  Hey, how about if I put the Krusty mask on my balls?  I think your balls are crusty enough.  Kenny, you've got to back off that mic a little bit.  I'm sorry.  Also, just before we went back on the air, Jim Norton was telling me about the HBO thing.  This is very exciting news.  Norton's going to be doing some stuff for HBO in the near future.  Yeah, the speakers keep cutting out every so often here at the Hard Rock. 
[01:03:00]  All right.  Well, just so you know, because people have been asking me, like, I'm shooting for HBO at the end of April here in New York.  And tickets for that are going to be available through websites.  So we'll announce when.  But you guys can come.  They're going to be free tickets.  I want to get as many O&A fans as I can down for the taping.  We just don't know exactly when they're going to be available.  That's always good in the middle of an HBO plug for the speaker to go out.  And you can get tickets from.  They heard it in Iowa, though, so.  All right.  Good. 
[01:03:30]  Hey, I was just handed a note.  Pat from Monocchio is here.  He's already been on the radio.  Of course he is.  If you're just tuning in.  And he memorized my favorite speech from Planes, Trains, and Automobile.  Well, everybody seems to think he's got that type of personality and look.  The John Candy thing from Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.  You kind of got that going for you.  You know, I think you realize that, right?  Yeah.  And you've memorized some of the dialogue?  Yes, I have. 
[01:04:00]  Well, why don't you come up here?  All righty.  I guess Pat prepared a lot of material for the live broadcast today.  He's a go-getter.  He's actually prepared.  Here he comes.  Uh-oh.  What's the weight capacity of this stage?  Uh-oh.  Volume 4.  One more time.  Stage diving.  It would have collapsed.  Everyone's backing up.  All right.  Shall I go into my speech?  Well, do you guys want to hear Pat from Menachie? 
[01:04:30]  Okay.  I'd rather just have him stand up there all uncomfortable for a while.  You want to hurt me?  Go right ahead if it makes you feel any better.  Wait a minute.  Can I request that you don't do it like James Cagney?  Yeah.  You want to hurt me, see?  Can't get me, Kappas.  Okay.  You want to hurt me?  Go right ahead if it makes you feel any better.  I'm an easy target.  Yeah, you're right.  I talk too much. 
[01:05:00]  I also listen too much.  Uh, I can be a cold-hearted cynic like you.  Uh.  But I don't like to hurt people's feelings.  Uh.  Well, you think what you want about me.  I'm not changing.  I like me.  My wife likes me.  My customers like me.  Because I'm the real article.  What you see is what you get.  By the way, you know, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point. 
[01:05:30]  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Can I say, Pat?  Is that supposed to be sexy?  You make.  Thank you.  You make Rich Voss seem like Gary Oldman.  That was some of the worst acting I've ever seen.  Thank you.  I like me.  I thought you liked me.  Well, let me.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  You didn't memorize it?  I thought you said you memorized it.  Yeah, I did.  But there's, uh, like a little.  I'm feeling a little pressure here.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a little intimidating to do a live broadcast on a high stage like this. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Robert Blake, uh.  Oh.  He got, he got a woof, right?  Yeah.  That's the name of that tune.  And, you know, I, but he was convicted of raping Marcel Marceau.  I guess you shouldn't do the mime if you can't do the time.  Ha, ha, ha.  Uh.  A Marcel Marceau joke.  Wow.  Wow.  Can I leave now?  That's terrific.  Wow.  That's terrific.  You should have at least updated the mime joke by adding in Shields and Yarnell. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, my God.  All right.  Once again, that's, uh, Pat from Minocchio.  Awful.  That wasn't bad.  That wasn't bad.  It was horrid.  It was awful.  We're going to have Club Soda Kenny do the news in a little while.  But, yeah, the big news is the Robert Blake thing.  Yeah.  Uh, you absolutely had it on the head, Opie.  Uh, I was saying he's going away.  He's going to do some time.  Uh, it was pretty obvious that, that he killed his wife. 
[01:07:00]  But, um, there it is.  The jury was out.  You said they were out a little too long.  If it was, if he was guilty, they would have come right back.  And, um, they came back and acquitted him.  Yeah, I was at the gym.  Everyone was crowded around the TV.  No one could believe it, you know.  And then you see him almost pass out.  What happened?  The speakers, they can't hear.  Oh, they can't hear?  See, the speakers keep going out.  I'll, I'll, I'll just, I'll just make a nice little announcement to the audience here.  We, we understand the speakers keep going out here.  Um, uh, they're working on that. 
[01:07:30]  Hopefully it'll be remedied.  Um, but you know something?  There's a few more people that aren't here that are listening to the show.  It's not about you.  They, they can hear us just fine.  They're saying, it's not about you, douchebag.  Wow, they're starting a fight with the, the listeners, you know, that aren't here.  Yeah.  Nah, we, we get it.  We're, we're trying, we're trying to fix that problem for some reason. 
[01:08:00]  For some reason they have bands play here and everything's fine and dandy, but the second  this stupid show tries to, uh, talk into the microphones, the speakers keep petering  out.  And trust me, we're not saying anything very exciting right now anyway.  We're just, we're, we're doing what's called filler until the next dummy comes up here  and does something for us.  Filler.  Filler, right.  Yeah.  So he, so Robert Blake.  He was very happy.  Did you see him, uh, when, when the verdict came in, he, he hugged his lawyer, I guess. 
[01:08:30]  Well, his hand was shaking and what was he trying to get a mint out of his pocket or  something?  Trying to get a gun out.  Probably a gun.  Shoot somebody, that murderer.  I think, I guess they figured now this makes up for OJ because everybody said it was race  was the reason that OJ got off the hook.  But, uh, truth of the matter is it, it does seem to be cash and your, uh, Hollywood  celebrity status because the guy is so goddamn guilty.  Who was buying that story about, uh, forgetting his gun in the restaurant? 
[01:09:00]  He goes into the restaurant, leaves his wife out in the car.  He comes back and she's shot.  There's just too many gun things going on at one moment, uh, for you not to be absolutely  guilty of killing her.  But she came across as a real bitch anyway.  Yeah, she was awful.  Real rag.  Not very sympathetic character.  No.  Uh, for the jury.  You know, not that that's right or anything, but I guess they just looked, said, hey, I  enjoy watching Beretta.  Uh, fuck it.  Let him off the hook.  You know, a couple quotes from, uh, Robert Blake. 
[01:09:30]  He says, I never lost hope.  If you live to be a million, you'll never ever in your life meet anyone more blessed than  me.  More blessed?  More blessed than him.  It's a blessing to spend a couple of years of your life in lockup?  Yeah, you had to shoot a fat whore to keep him from getting your cash.  Lucky devil.  And then, uh, I guess he went through $10 million in five years.  $10 million in five years for his freedom.  Oh, the, uh, yeah, the lawyers get a lot of money, believe me.  Would have been cheaper to divorce her. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, but then she's still breathing.  Yeah.  You've got to remedy that situation.  I like the Scott Peterson solution myself.  Can I change the subject?  No.  Yes, Kenny.  We have mask cards for Don Geronimo's dog.  Oh, my God.  Somebody printed these up, huh?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Can I please see one of those?  It's, uh, Rudy Geronimo.  Thanks, sweetie.  This is going to be a collector's item, man.  His, uh, date of, uh, birth and death.  Poor little fella in loving memory. 
[01:10:30]  And then on the back, it's got the footprints poem.  It was then that I saw one set of paw prints.  And he said, that was when I was backing over you.  Why, God, in my most needy of times,  did your footprints disappear  and the tire tracks of an SUV suddenly appear in my path?  Great.  All right, Kenny, hand this out to everybody.  Okay.  The message board is alive with, uh, speculation also.  I guess, uh, Don on his show the other day mentioned, 
[01:11:00]  or on one of their websites, the wife's website,  that bitch wife of his,  uh, she wrote on a website  that, uh, they're going to decompress a little  from Rudy dying next week  by going on a Caribbean cruise.  So now everyone's speculating  if I'm going to be on the same ship  as this son of a bitch.  Is it possible?  It's entirely possible  that I may be on the same cruise as Don Geronimo,  where I will reenact the Leon Klinghoffer scene  and roll that fat ass off the deck. 
[01:11:30]  Boys?  Yes.  Gina left her cell phone in the ladies' room.  You want to make some phony phone calls?  Oh, let's see.  This is somebody's cell phone?  Yeah, it was found in the ladies' room.  I believe it's Gina.  Where's her phone book?  Let me see.  Uh, all contacts, John.  Wow.  Wow.  Let's call some people up.  Hmm.  Just call the last number.  Let's see each other. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah?  I'm calling John at work.  That's what we have to see every morning.  Yeah, for you guys playing at home,  Norton is eating a banana right now.  The way no male should eat a banana.  You got anything on that cell phone in?  John's not in.  Oh, I think I just erased his number.  Oh, I'm looking for, uh, delete all contacts. 
[01:12:30]  That should be the one.  View all.  She only seems to have like one number in here.  Oh, how about recently?  There it is.  I'll go to the main menu.  And then recently made calls.  What a mess.  Go ahead.  Just chat it up while I'm doing this.  Is she here?  Does she know we have our phone?  Yeah, where's Gina?  Everyone's pointing in a different direction.  I guess she's a little embarrassed to let everybody know she's a dumb cunt. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, wow.  Jesus, Kenny.  Jeez.  Kenny.  Warning.  Warning.  Seaward alert.  Seaward alert.  Warning.  Warning.  Warning.  You got to give me that warning there, Kenny.  Sorry.  Uh, recent incoming calls.  Here we go.  Let's just hit a random one here.  All right.  Anthony is making a call on Gina's cell phone that she left in the bathroom.  Oh, it's ringing. 
[01:13:30]  Banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Is that okay?  Administrative services.  Some recording.  Fuck, fuck, fuck.  Your AIDS test is negative.  Oh, lucky gal.  Here's Gina's boyfriend to collect the phone.  Oh.  That's how you know you're reaching on a radio show when the big finale is, look, we're finding 
[01:14:00]  someone to pick up a lost telephone.  Yeah.  God, do we stink.  Are you friends with Gina?  Are you John?  No, I'm Ed.  Ed?  Where's your name?  No, I'm in there somewhere.  You know you look like BTK, don't you?  I don't know who that is.  Sorry, Jim.  That was a serial killer, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's got some boring-ass numbers in here. 
[01:14:30]  She actually has 411 and speed dial.  What the hell are you doing with her?  What's wrong with her?  It's a little uncomfortable right now.  I need information now.  All right.  All right.  Give the phone back.  Can I throw it?  No.  Yeah.  All right.  Don't give it to me, then.  Where is she, by the way?  Yeah, where is she?  She left in the bathroom.  She passed out in a stall somewhere?  She's in the back somewhere. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, yeah.  I went to go get a beer.  She's still squeezing a log out?  Yeah.  You know if she's fucking ugly or she would have came up here.  Oh.  That might not be true.  Kenny.  Kenny.  She's not very nice.  Look, he's all upset.  We've got to keep our female listeners.  We only have five, I think, here.  They're all here.  Five or six.  Brave enough to it.  Every one of them are here, too.  Come down to the Hard Rock Cafe.  So, the Blake thing is over.  And like I told you, I knew that was going to end with an acquittal. 
[01:15:30]  You were the one yesterday.  But you were saying that there wasn't enough information to connect the whole damn thing, right?  Yeah, that's what the jury seems to say.  It's one of those things where you can tell that he was guilty.  Everyone knows it.  But for some reason, they weren't able to come up with enough pieces of the puzzle.  There were a few too many missing pieces.  So, they let him go.  I don't know.  Maybe they were just enamored by him.  But, yeah, off the hook.  And on the same day, the judge sentenced our favorite, Scott Peterson, to death. 
[01:16:00]  So, he's on death row now in California.  Really?  He actually gets his cell, gets to overlook the bay where he tossed her.  Really?  Tossed that nagging wife of his.  Mom, at least for you.  Tossed the inconvenience.  Yeah, I think we have some audio of what went down yesterday, Anthony.  Oh, we do.  Oh, yeah.  They brought a little CD player for us and everything. 
[01:16:30]  We're high tech here today.  I'm surprised it's working.  Greta reads victim statements from Peterson's sentencing.  Who's that?  Greta Van Sustrand.  Greta Van Sustrand.  This is Brent Rocha, Lacey's brother.  All right.  Told by Greta, I guess, right?  When you get put to death, when you walk into that death chamber at San Quentin, look over  to your shoulder.  Because if you look over to your shoulder, there's the San Francisco Bay.  There's Brooks Island.  That's where he dumped the bodies. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, so when he takes his little final walk, look over your shoulder.  Why, is there a window on the Green Mile?  You can kind of look out, see the water.  Like he cares.  Yeah.  Like that's going to bother him at this point.  Yeah, I think he's not going to be thinking about Lacey when he's taking that walk.  It'll take at least, how long do you think it's going to take to?  Ten years.  Ten or eleven years.  At least.  At least, right?  Ten years.  All right, now here's Greta reading the victim's statement from Lacey's mother, Sharon Rocha. 
[01:17:30]  Oh.  No arms, no head to kiss her baby.  I am haunted every day.  Did she know you were killing her?  Did you look her in the eye when you killed her?  Was she alive when you put her in the bay?  You deserve death as soon as possible.  What do you think Lacey was thinking as you killed her?  Do you know what your son was thinking?  Daddy, please, please, please don't kill me, Daddy.  I want to live.  Why are you killing us?  And then she said, you deserve to burn in hell. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, my God.  That's not what he was thinking.  I bet you when she was nagging, the little kid was thinking, I wish Mom would shut up.  This is getting ugly.  Yeah, exactly.  What was he thinking?  Nothing.  No x-ray vision to see through the womb?  Yeah.  See the father strangling her?  The abortion song.  The abortion song.  A diary of an unborn fetus?  Oh, yeah, there you go.  We could play Diary of an Unborn Fetus or maybe Remembering Lacey. 
[01:18:30]  Remembering Lacey.  I say Remembering Lacey.  Yeah, I haven't heard that one in a while.  That's a good one.  I like that.  Well, we got Eric on his cell phone.  He's got to call back to the station.  Aren't they listening to the show right now?  Why do you have to call them?  Yeah, they're listening to something else.  It's like, if you're listening, go get...  Here it is, right?  Oh, there you go.  Put your phone away.  Shh.  All right.  Haunting.  Remembering Lacey.  How her smile would make you smile. 
[01:19:00]  Ah.  Remembering Lacey.  How she loved, there's no denial.  Now the angels hold her gently.  And little Connor's with her, too.  And she's smiling and says, we're all right.  And we said, I love to you.  To you.  So full of life and happiness.  Well, pretty Lacey's life. 
[01:19:30]  With little Connor on the way, just made things seem so right.  So right.  Still the two of them together, from the start to heaven's door.  Aw.  And she smiles and says, we love you, to the one she's loved before.  Should have played this into your sentence.  The tears that fell, made flowers bloom on earth in heaven, too. 
[01:20:00]  No!  And little Connor.  Ah!  Ah!  Did you see that shirt?  He's for you.  Aw.  He stepped on the funny part.  Ah!  Special tributes from afar.  We missed, Mama.  These for you.  As you gaze into the heavens, look, the Lacey Connor star.  Lacey Connor star.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:20:30]  That's terrific.  Remembering, Lacey, how her smile would make you smile.  Turn it off.  Remembering, Lacey, how she loved you, how female.  Now the angels hold her gently, and little Connor's with her, too.  Little Connor's not with her.  And she smiles and says, we're all right, and we send our love to you. 
[01:21:00]  All right, all right, enough.  Where's the part where the crabs claw her eyeballs out?  As her hair slowly wisps with the tide.  That horrific little scene.  You're getting horrific looks right now.  We missed, Mama, this for you.  I know.  Well, we were trying to mix it, and, you know, that's what happens when we are live, I guess.  Some barracuda sitting there curled up with Connor, peeking out. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, wonderful.  So he's sentenced to death.  The jury had sentenced him to death, but that's like some kind of suggestion that the judge has to take.  And then months later, they get back in the courtroom, and the judge takes the jury's word for it, I guess, and sentenced him to death.  And they brought back that opportunistic, red-headed juror.  Oh, the Steven Tyler lookalike?  Yeah, Steven Tyler was on the jury.  Yeah.  Didn't know Steven Tyler with tits. 
[01:22:00]  Man, is she an opportunist or what?  Yeah, this one loves the fame.  She loved it when they first gave him the death sentence.  She was in front of all the cameras.  She was on Larry King, and now the judge gives him death, and she figured she'd get out there in the public eye again.  And she was on all the news channels just to, yeah, talking about how horrible it is.  And meanwhile, she's trying to get some type of fame and book deal and everything else off of this.  You know, we're scumbags with it.  We know we're exploiting them. 
[01:22:30]  You know, no fake morality here.  We know we're assholes when it comes to the Lacey and Connor thing.  But hell, funny's funny, right?  All right, Ann, why don't we take a break?  I think funnier than dead fetuses.  We're going to take a break.  I think when we come back, we'll have Club Soda Kenny do the rest of the news for us, Anthony.  I'm going to call this a bloody Connor in memory just for today.  Oh, bloody Connor.  Also, we're looking for people to do stuff for my fives. 
[01:23:00]  If you've got an idea, come on up and talk to us.  In the meantime, a little music, a little break, some drinking,  and we'll be back live from the Hard Rock Cafe.  It's the O.P. and Anthony program.  As I was going over the Cork and Cary Mountains, 
[01:23:30]  I saw Captain Bill, and his money he was counting.  I first bruised my pit door, and then bruised my radio.  I said, stand down to live, oh, what a devil, he may take you.  I took all of his money, and it was a pretty penny. 
[01:24:00]  I took all of his money, yeah, and I brought his own tamale.  She's the more hole that you have made.  No devil would she leave me. 
[01:24:30]  The devil would take that woman, yeah, but you know she'd bring me easy.  I said, stand down to live, oh, what a devil, he may take you.  Bein' drunk and weary, I went to my last chamber.

No Kenny  Who is he?  Who is he Kenny? 
[01:37:30]  He's like the fag from Survivor  That walked around naked  Right  He thought the network  Was going to pay the taxes  On his million dollar prize  In a radio interview in Los Angeles  Hatch spoke publicly  For the first time  About his tax problems  And insisting  He is absolutely not guilty  A nice little shit pick chant  This is going well 
[01:38:00]  Yeah  We kind of like it  Hatch lives in Rhode Island  With the rest of the fags  And he backed out of a plea agreement  Last week  And the U.S.  Hold on, hold on  How do you know all the fags live in  Where?

[01:38:30]  Right  What's their  Whatever  Hatch's lawyer, Michael Mims  Who sounds like another bologna smoker  Is that in the news story?  Kenny  What?  When Peter Jennings was doing this story last night  I didn't hear bologna smoker  Well, I'm editorializing a little bit  Yeah, a little bit  A little bit now  And Hatch should have been classified as a CBS employee  Which a lot of people don't know  CBS stands for 
[01:39:00]  Can't Bash Sissies  Oh  Uh-oh  Uh-oh  Oh  That one's gonna hurt, Kenny  Yeah  Hatch was under the impression  That they were either going to withhold from his check  Or pay his taxes  And apparently neither occurred  Mims said the network has never explained  Whether Hatch's prize was $1 million  Or $1 million plus to taxes  I wish I had those fucking problems 
[01:39:30]  You're a phony  Hey  This guy's a great big phony  Hey  You're a great big phony  You know that?

[01:53:00]  Drinking beer  The Aussies won't let the Americans use the pool  No it's weird  The Italians over there  Are the only ones that can drink  The Italians and the Aussie  They don't let the American troops drink  Because we're so fucking politically correct  What a load of shit that is  So they could sit there and drink  The Italians and the Aussies  The Italians drink  And they take the booze over to the American camps  Yeah  To get the women back  And they fuck the American women over at their base  Holy shit  This is probably the worst thing I've heard coming out of Iraq 
[01:53:30]  I gotta say this though  In fairness  The last time American troops drank  It was alright  Get nine of them on a fucking hill  And put things in their ass  And photograph it  We've proved that we don't handle  The Italians are very sexy  They have their  Their outfits are actually  European cut  Like they fit to their bodies  Really?  They all look like models  Bastards, right?  I wanted to fuck a couple of them  So they're taking the American soldiers  The women  That are over there  And you know  American women soldiers  Are known for their beauty  Well you know 
[01:54:00]  I'm not a  There's some  I don't know if it was  Are you kidding?  Listen to me  I don't know if it was  Because I was in Iraq  Yeah  They got some hot chicks  Grated on a curve  They're hot  Because you look at the  These women  And then you look at the Americans  Those chicks are hot too  At least they have hot eyes  That's all I saw  You are one of the horniest men alive  If you're thinking Iraqi women are hot  Oh they're not that bad  They're not that bad  Really?  Oh yeah  Your eyebrow hair and your pubic hair  Shouldn't connect  But that  It's fine  Exactly 
[01:54:30]  Well pick your side you faggots  I know  How could they be oohing and aahing  Me and you?  We're holding an argument here  And we got people groaning and moaning  They are known to be hairy women  Well you know  What's his name?

Alright so the flight over  Colin Quinn was asleep the whole time 
[01:55:30]  Hey was the flight in scary?  You know  Would you land in Baghdad?  No we landed in Kuwait  Or did you land in Kuwait  And then you drove up?  Then we  No we flew  In what?  In a C-130  Right  So how was that now?  It was unbelievable  The only one that was bad  Was on the day we were leaving  We had a stop in Fallujah  Which I don't  For two other comics from Boston  Two open micers  You're picking up open micers in Fallujah?  You're doing a one nighter in Fallujah  I think that's on backwards by the way  You're supposed to put it on the other ear 
[01:56:00]  And then turn the mic around  Well on the C-130 it went the other way  There you go  There you go  Thank you  Hey  There he is  Now you have it  Yes  Alright continue  So on the way out  We  All of a sudden  We saw like these bright lights  Just shoot in the fucking windows  Out of Fallujah  Uh oh  And I was  I thought it was the sun  Like the sunset  Yeah  Shooting in  But it was the actual fucking  You know  Flare shooting off the plane  One of those freaking apes  Shot a rocket at the plane  One of those apes  Flying out of fucking Fallujah 
[01:56:30]  Really?  We're just naive  We're just like  Look at the sun coming through  And then the guy  And it was like  The anti-missile flares  That they were shooting out  The back of the plane  Two of them just shot off  Just red beams  Shot through the fucking windows  That's pretty scary  And the guy goes  Yeah that probably was something  Coming at the plane  Probably something  And he goes  It might have been nothing  And then the guy leaned over  He goes  Let me tell you something  Don't believe that asshole  Those flares don't go off  When somebody hucks a penny  At the plane  So 
[01:57:00]  Oh  Colin was pissed too  He goes  The legend  The legend's gonna die  For two fucking open micers  The legend  The legend  Is that what he's calling himself now  He was annoying  He does not shut the fuck up  He just yaps  The whole time you're over there  Did the missile heading toward the plane  Say Comedy Central on the side  Actually it said  From Greg Giraldo  But yeah  He does not shut the fuck up  He yapped  The whole trip  And he smashed me 
[01:57:30]  The whole  He would not shut  He would not stop smashing me  The whole fucking trip  The two favorite lines  When I was in my sleeping bag  He said  I look like a woman's  A woman's speed stick  And then  And then when we were  We got out of the helicopter  At like two in the morning  And they gave us  Those little brake lights  Yeah  And I had two of them  I don't know why  The guy gave me two  So I'm standing there like this  And he goes  Bob looks like a plane  Landing a plane  Fucking asshole  That's what Colin does 
[01:58:00]  He's just a fucking bully  Like he'll smash you  In front of all the troops  Just to get them laughing  And on his side  Yeah  Oh yeah  That's how he  As soon as he walks up  He's like  Hey this is Bob  Fat Bob  Yeah  He's been eating the whole trip  And they're like  I'm laughing at you  He actually walked into  The fucking marine base  And he starts talking  To all these marines  And he goes  Yeah Bob  He's a liberal  Left wing  He's against the war  He really doesn't believe  In the war  I tried to talk to him  But he doesn't  You know  He's against everything  You guys are doing over here  But you know  He's going to try  To see what's going on  Before you even walk in  You're the scumbag  Oh they're all staring at me  They don't take sarcasm 
[01:58:30]  Too well over there  Those fucking marines  I think they're over  Done with the sarcasm  He did the same thing to me  To a bunch of warthog pilots  And he's like  Yeah Jim's a liberal  He's against the war  And the one guy's like  Hey man I guess  That's what we're over  Fighting here for  You're right  To feel how you want to feel  Oh shit  You've got to explain to him  No I'm not  You look like you're just lying  I'm pro war  I haven't washed my ass  In a week  Just to let you know  Smell my finger  Come here  Well we're trying to give away  My fives  You know that could be a possibility  Does anybody want to wash my ass  A stink finger  If somebody will smell Bob's finger

[03:25:30]  Yeah look how uncivilized  I thought that was his style  That's what I thought too  But no it's just his clothes are on the floor and all wrinkled  But now you have a dresser  I'm very proud of you  Not yet  Not yet  It's on its way though  He's actually entering the world of furnished apartments  Yeah  Great man  Congratulations  Isn't that great  I got to figure out where I have my shirts next  I read in the paper how much money we were being paid  Yeah  You know sometimes they overblow it and stuff 
[03:26:00]  But you got to figure it's somewhere in the ballpark  Of being able to own furniture  Of being able to own furniture  I would think so  Something  But no  I just didn't get around to buying furniture  I don't know  Didn't get around to it  Because we had two years off  That's right  Where we weren't allowed to work  But in that two years  You couldn't find time to buy furniture  It's a depreciating asset  The second you buy it  I mean what's really worth  Well the second one leaves the showroom  You know  Yeah  Please  You're losing value  Every time you open a drawer  The value goes down  I'm one of seven  We had to share everything 
[03:26:30]  So to me it's no big deal  You know  I'm waiting to find one that's going into bankruptcy  Like a foreclosed dresser or something  Must sell everything now  Going out of business  We're liquidating all our dressers  I'm just very excited  I don't even know  You know  Very happy  Very happy for you  Wonderful  Wait till you get that end table  You get that lamp up to Iowa  Hey hey  Slow down  What's an end table  I don't have an end table  End table  I talked about that  He has a bed  It's a mattress and a box spring  On that metal frame  That comes with the bed  It's got no headboard  No like night tables  On the side of the bed
