<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Reg Hughes, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton jokingly referring to their show as "out-of-control" and "self-destructive," lamenting their perceived inferior treatment by SiriusXM compared to other personalities.  They previewed segments including a visit from Kevin Smith to promote "Red State," and the "Car Crash Comedy" competition in their SiriusXM studio.  A lengthy discussion on the decline of BlackBerrys and the rise of iPhones followed, interspersed with caller contributions and Jim Norton's recounting of a PMS-fueled argument with his girlfriend.  The obsolescence of desktop computers was also briefly touched upon.  A substantial segment focused on guessing the "world's most typical human being," eventually revealed to be a 28-year-old Han Chinese man.  A caller's experience listening to the show in a rental car and a concluding bit about Taylor Momsen's appearance and a host’s observation about a woman's thumbs rounded out this section. Rich Voss and Bob Kelly were mentioned as guests, alongside the appearance of  Kevin Smith and Carrie Bechet from *Red State*.

Opie then launched into a series of seemingly random statistics (global bank account ownership, average male heights, life expectancy disparities, and water usage), expressing frustration with the filler material before transitioning to a discussion about shifting global demographics and the decline of the white male majority.  He complained about a neck injury from napping, leading to a discussion about the hosts' aversion to physical touch, particularly Rich Voss's discomfort, possibly linked to Asperger's, and their experiences with forced physical contact in 12-step meetings.  Opie discussed uncomfortable moments from his stand-up routine, including telling an inappropriate joke in front of his daughter. Kevin Smith arrived late, his weight loss noted, and the conversation turned to *Red State*, its promotion, and a woman's shoplifting incident. Images of New Jersey black bears were also displayed.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a discussion of the Westboro Baptist Church, their protests, and the debate over whether their actions warrant a violent response.  The documentary *Catfish* was discussed, focusing on its authenticity. The Academy Awards, Kevin Smith's social media activity during the broadcast, and his opinions on the event were also covered. Rich Voss’s filmmaking anxieties were discussed before the show moved onto a segment about Peter Sellers and the Pink Panther movies, launching into a discussion on film remakes, including a hypothetical “black” Odd Couple.  This transitioned back to Kevin Smith, who discussed *Red State* (featuring Melissa Leo and Amy Ryan), and his internet radio show. James Norton (*The Tonight Show*) and Bob Kelly (and his recent appearance on Bill Maher discussing “dick jokes,” including a specific “cock crow” joke) were mentioned.  The hosts shared personal relationship annoyances (loud apple-eating and toenail-picking), with Rich Voss sharing particularly extreme toenail-picking experiences. Snopes.com and Howie Mandel's hospitalization were briefly discussed.

The "Car Crash Comedy" segment followed, judged by Jim Norton, Rich Voss, and Bob Kelly.  Multiple amateur comedians performed sets filled with crude and offensive jokes, frequently interrupted by car crash sound effects and judged with insults and personal criticisms of their appearance and performances.

The Car Crash Comedy competition continued, starting with Dave Corley from South Carolina. The hosts promoted their upcoming shows at the Stress Factory and Arlington Cinema Drafthouse, engaging in crude and offensive jokes targeting audience members based on their age and appearance.  Two female audience members were brought on stage and subjected to similar treatment. The competition continued with comedians Mark and Durko, Ramon Rivez, Seton Smith, and Bill Squire, all delivering sets with offensive jokes about AIDS, race, and other controversial topics.  Seton Smith and Bill Squire were selected as finalists after further offensive banter.  Their final sets concluded the competition, with Bill Squire declared the winner, receiving $2,000 and a future Borgata appearance.  Throughout the Car Crash Comedy segment, the pervasive use of highly offensive language and shock humor targeting performers and audience members was consistent.  The comedians then plugged their own upcoming shows and social media accounts.  The show concluded with Bill Squire’s win being announced.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny, and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Uh, funny.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Friday.  We'll be right back. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning.  I know.  That gave me incentive to roll out of bed.  What, just that it was Friday?  Yeah, yeah.  Sometimes you're like, oh, boy, if it was Thursday, wow, there'd be trouble.  If it was Thursday, somebody would be calling sick.  Oh, you'd just call out.  Calling in sick, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Nah, nah.  Yeah, hi. 
[00:02:00]  Nah, my throat.  Hey, man, my throat is really bad.  I don't know.  Yeah, but it's Friday, so, you know, you suck it up.  Suck it up.  We got such a busy show.  This thing's going to fly by today.  Oh, my God.  It's already 10 o'clock.  Take it easy, everyone.  We got Kevin Smith coming in to promote Red State.  Red State.  He's doing the big Radio City Music Hall Red State premiere tomorrow night.  So he's coming in to promote that a little bit and actually just to hang with us.  So that's an easy hour because you say, hey, Kev, how's things? 
[00:02:30]  Next thing you know, an hour flies by.  It's an hour.  He's great with that.  Well serves.  Yeah, yeah.  Love the Kevin Smith.  He's a great conversationally, conversationally wonderful speaker.  He can talk about anything.  Yeah.  He should maybe do radio or a podcast or something.  Oh, that's right.  Also, we got Rich Voss and Bob Kelly coming in because we're doing car crash comedy in the fishbowl.  Hey, did Kevin do Radio City yet?  No.  I think he's going to do it, yeah.  Oh, he's actually doing it tomorrow.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Manana. 
[00:03:00]  And then, yeah, and then we'll do a couple hours here and then we'll move over to the  fishbowl.  We'll look at some comedy.  We'll crash them and we'll get the hell out of here.  Start our weekends.  People looking at us in there.  All the people that walk by.  It's like, oh, or do they cordon it off?  Do they block it off?  Like, you ever notice when celebrities are in there and they're doing their radio shows,  it's left open and people are like, well, if you walk into the lobby, you'll notice Rosie  O'Donnell is in here doing a show.  And when we go in there, it's like, oh, God, please just put everything we got over the 
[00:03:30]  windows so no one sees us.  Well, see, that's actually what they do because they're not really proud of us and the type  of show we do.  They're like, you want to use the fishbowl?  And then they look at each other like, oh, boy.  Oh, fuck.  They cover up everything.  So you don't even know anything's going on in there.  Every nook and cranny.  When we're in there.  But if Rosie's doing a show or anyone else.  Oh, yeah.  Put the spotlight on.  Yeah, you could check it out.  You see welcome Rosie things and big fucking signs.  Horses.  Oh, it's catered. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  We go in there.  It's like, oh, do you really have to use it?  Like the retarded child that they want kept in the room during the parties.  It's really too bad what happened to us.  Oh, God.  We brought it on ourselves.  What are we kidding?  I don't think we did.  Oh, we did.  I really don't think we did.  We're fucking degenerates.  Would you like another opinion?  No.  I think we've changed our act enough to get some kind of respect.  It's like if Manson changed his act. 
[00:04:30]  I guess.  It's like he's always just going to be the guy with the swastika carved in his head.  I guess you're right.  It doesn't matter what we do anymore.  We've made our bed.  Now we got to lay in it.  Yeah, it's all right.  Yeah.  I don't mind at all.  How's everyone?  Everyone have a good night.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Wunderbar.  Very, very, very good.  I'm tuckered out.  Yeah, yeah.  Why, why, why, why?  I just did the sleep.  My girlfriend and I were arguing a bit last night.  Oh, no.  You guys don't argue a lot, though, I noticed. 
[00:05:00]  We've been better lately.  We were on a roll.  We were terrible.  Very passionate.  You two are very passionate.  You know how it is.  Passionate lovers.  Yes, that's why it, uh.  What was the argument about it?  You don't want to go there.  Honestly, it wouldn't.  Because I love asking you, because your arguments sometimes are over very basic things.  It wouldn't make sense if I told you, because it was one of those things.  That's exactly what it was.  There was one Valtrex left, and we both yelled, mine.  No, it was, um, just one of those dumb PMS things that women go through. 
[00:05:30]  It's like, you know.  Uh-oh, that means you're blaming her.  I bet you she would have a different opinion.  No, she'd probably tell you that, too.  PMS is horrible.  She's acknowledging it was PMS.  Yeah, I mean, we both knew it was.  But, uh, it was just, you know, it's always late.  Always starts late.  Yeah, late at night.  Oh, those are the worst.  Late at night arguments.  Wow.  Well, I haven't been in one of those in fucking a long-ass time.  But I remember them.  Oof.  They always want to start the argument as your head hits the pillow.  It's the weirdest phenomenon with women. 
[00:06:00]  And you look at them like, you're kidding, right?  I've got to be up in six hours.  Yeah, why are you doing this?  And even if we've figured this shit out now, it's going to take another hour or two for  the brain to calm down.  Right?  And then for the whole thing to mellow out.  For the situation.  Yeah.  Because even if it's solved, it's like there's still that fucking, like, burp, burp, burp.  To calm down, period.  It is a tactic.  It is a tactic.  And then the makeup sex.  Power tactic.  And then you get a little snack after the night.  And then all of a sudden it's six o'clock and you've got to get up. 
[00:06:30]  I know.  And then you're fucked.  But things good, Jimmy?  Yeah, yeah, things are good.  I figured it out.  Just the hours.  You know.  What time did the argument start?  Twelve something?  Twelve something?  Yeah.  That's like the middle of the night for me.  I know.  It's much too late.  Twelve something?  Well, I slept late.  Yes, I napped yesterday.  I slept till I ate something.  How does a fight start at twelve something during the week?  I understand maybe on the weekends.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God. 
[00:07:00]  My, uh...  Like after Letterman?  Ah!  My access is...  Oh, my God!  My hours are very, uh...  Very different than the hours in person.  They're crazy, yeah.  I understand.  But the real thing today, by the way, is the important thing.  It's not Car Crash Conrad.  It's not Car Crash Conrad.  It's not Car Crash Conrad.  It's not Car Crash Conrad.  It's not Car Crash Conrad.  It's not Car Crash Conrad.  It's not Car Crash Conrad.  It's not Car Crash Conrad.  It's Fios.  Oh, you got the Fios.  Not yet.  Not today they're coming.  Today's the big day for Fios.  Oh, right.  I cannot wait to get the Jim Norton review after a, you know, weekend with...  Well, he'll...  Looks like...  I was just gonna say after he can't figure out something and then has a scathing review 
[00:07:30]  on Monday.  It stinks!  Oh, my God.  I fucking can't figure out how to fucking...  If I could replace it tomorrow, I will...  Oh, my God.  Jimmy, I'm mad at it.  Give it a day or two, Jimmy.  Figure some stuff out, please.  I'm waiting for your review because I'm the building right next to you and we have Fios  too, but I'm not...  I didn't jump in yet.  Oh, I couldn't wait.  As soon as you said you're jumping in, I'm gonna go...  Oh, you're...  I'm thinking, let me see what Jimmy has to say. 
[00:08:00]  They have to put it on a computer, though, right?  They'll love it.  What?  Sort of.  Not really.  They have some software that they install on a laptop, like, to manage, but you don't...  I mean...  Can they do it on a desktop?  Yeah.  I just delete that shit when they're done.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You don't need that stuff.  I got a desktop that's just fucking getting killed by viruses.  Oh, really?  Is it just rotting in a corner with viruses?  Yeah.  It's got the plague.  I went out with some old friends yesterday and we were discussing this and they said  by the year...  I forgot what year, but very soon, I think 2015, the desktop computer will not be around 
[00:08:30]  anymore.  Absolutely.  It's gonna be one of those things that completely goes away because if you look, everyone's  got the laptops.  Not everyone, but we're heading that way.  Yeah, yeah.  You got the laptops, you got the iPad, and you can do all your shit on your phone.  And on your phone.  So people are gonna...  It's gonna be very niche.  People that have certain needs for it, the big monitor...  But in general, they're saying that is absolutely gonna go away, the desktop.  Yeah, yeah.  I hate that you're...  You're right.  Post-PC market.  Thank you, Danny.  I have a big, a nice desktop, a really good Apple, a Mac... 
[00:09:00]  Oh, yeah, the Power Mac.  I've seen yours.  It's amazing.  It's fucking great.  30-inch screens.  Oh, yeah, the 30-inch.  And I know...  I don't have it long enough to justify getting rid of it, and I haven't done enough with  it.  Mine's just sitting there.  And I turned it on the other day.  There are so many, like, screens I gotta close.  Oh, really?  It'll take 10 minutes to close all the screens that have popped up.  And my computer guy gave up on it.  He's supposed to come in and fix it, and whatever.  Why don't you just wipe it clean and start fresh? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  I don't even bother with fucking shit anymore.  Because kind of like...  You gotta help your dad out, man.  I know, I tried explaining to him that, like, look, if you're comfortable with your porno  viewing habits, at least get an external hard drive.  Right, right.  His machine probably has, like, 20 megabytes free, and it runs, like, you know, it takes,  like, three hours to boot up.  It's just one of those machines.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  And I'm just trying to get him onto the ex-hamster scene, and he just doesn't want to listen  to me.  It's like, you don't have to look at pictures on your computer.  Right.  It's videos. 
[00:10:00]  If you like a video, and you're like, wow, I could totally beat off to that, like, seven more  times, just save it as a bookmark or something.  Like, it's not going anywhere.  It doesn't have to go on your fucking computer.  Or an external.  I love externals.  Yeah, those are great.  That's my motto.  Yeah.  I love externals.  I love externals.  That's like your fucking, uh, your credo, isn't it?  Yes.  Your motto.  Yes.  Yes!  Um, I think I found a new phone.  Really?  Breaking news, because, uh, you know, this has been a thing on the show for a while.  Does it start with an I and end with phone?  Well, let me explain something to you. 
[00:10:30]  That's a no, by the way.  My buddy, uh, Buzzy.  You know Buzzy.  Yeah.  He's a big, uh, big digital media guy.  And, uh, he's had the exact BlackBerry I have that I'm holding in my hand that looks very  archaic.  Now, why would he have that?  He did have it.  Then he went iPhone.  Yeah.  Now, I'm announcing that I'm going out, I think, and getting the Motorola Atrix 4G.  He loves this thing.  Yeah.  And I, I, I just, I, I want to hold out before I, I know, like, before I actually end up 
[00:11:00]  getting the iPhone down the road.  I want to try one more phone.  He loves it.  I like the carbon fiber look.  That's pretty cool.  Are you, are you being serious now?  No, I do.  The carbon fiber look has always been, like, cool thing.  It's got too many buttons on it, though.  Like, too many hard buttons.  I don't like hard buttons.  There's no hard buttons on that.  The bottom are all right.  No.  No, that's, that's, yeah, those.  Dedicated.  Dedicated.  Dedicated.  That's what I mean.  Yeah.  I, I'm going to, I'm going to fucking take a look at it today.  Because the BlackBerry is over. 
[00:11:30]  I have to announce that.  It's over.  They're terrible, dude.  I hung in there as long as I can, and they just don't have a new phone out there that's  worth buying.  The one they had all the commercials for was a bust.  That's why you saw all those commercials on TV.  They knew they were losing their ass.  Yeah.  And since then, they don't, they don't have another fucking phone.  I go to my cell guy, and he's like, it was supposed to come out around Christmas, and  then it was supposed to come out in January.  We're up to what, March now?  And there's still no, no phone around the corner.  I've hated them since the storm when I tried to go to Verizon with the storm. 
[00:12:00]  I hate BlackBerry.  Yeah.  I was talking to somebody in the Verizon store.  He goes, yeah, man, they're really, the guy's stubborn who runs it.  He's like a fucking dickhead.  Why is he stubborn?  The market is, doesn't allow for stubbornness.  I know.  You know what?  Because they're losing customers left and right.  The only people that got the BlackBerry are the businesses that got the contracts.  Like, SiriusXM has a BlackBerry contract.  So all their employees here have the BlackBerry.  It's meant for, you know, corporate fucking emails and shit.  It's not meant for fucking multimedia and fun. 
[00:12:30]  Like, the fucking iPhone is, uh...  And the reason I love the iPhone...  Everything I have, like my laptop and desktops and the iPad...  Like, even you have an iPad and shit.  I got a lot of Mac products.  There's so much shit to go back and forth.  And it's so easy to go back and forth from your phone to the iPad to the computer.  I know, I know.  It's all so fucking wrapped up in one nice little package of syncing shit up.  You don't have to worry about compatibility issues and bullshit. 
[00:13:00]  There's a million fucking apps.  Like, it just runs better.  I see what Keith the cop goes through with his dumbass phone.  And you're just going, what the fuck are you doing?  Why doesn't he have an iPhone?  Because...  Don't even start the argument.  Just because...  Why?  Because BlackBerry Messenger.  That's why.  Yeah.  See, I was a big fan of that.  I loved the BlackBerry message.  It's a text message.  What's the difference?  I loved it.  It's a text message, though.  So?  What's the...  So just text.  BBN.  Why would you like that?  See, when you had a lot of your friends and family on the BlackBerry,  it was just a cool thing to have. 
[00:13:30]  But they're all going away.  So now, yeah, you're right.  Now I'm texting those people I used to BlackBerry message.  Yeah, you just text everybody.  It's great.  I hate BBN.  The texts line up.  Yeah, it was just another thing to check, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  It was another icon with numbers popping up on it.  I liked it.  But the problem is, like, literally, I got two friends left on BBN.  Two.  That's it.  I used to have, like, I don't know, a dozen or so.  Easy.  Kenny has to get off to fucking BlackBerry.  Kenny's one of them.  Exactly.  And he's barely a friend. 
[00:14:00]  I don't know what he is.  He's my robot.  He's our robot, I should say.  Kenny is a friend and also a talking cadaver.  He's under two categories.  But I don't know how he keeps his BlackBerry.  It's like, get an iPhone.  He doesn't enjoy anything.  Look, Kenny, fucking have fun.  There was a time, us BlackBerry people, it made sense.  But it doesn't make sense anymore.  I'm here to say it's over.  It's over for BlackBerry.  We want you to get an iPhone.  Oh, Kenny.  Would you get an iPhone, Kenny?  I'm not smart enough to use Mac.  He has a Mac. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, the laptop.  I hate it.  I don't know how to use it.  But you don't try to learn how to use it.  You don't play with it and enjoy it.  I don't even think twice about using the Mac.  It's so easy.  I guess Keith's phone works.  He just texted, fuck off to me.  Fuck off.  Yeah, Keith got a BlackBerry.  Well, fuck off.  Exactly.  He also had a Storm, the eight-click-per-letter Storm.  That dumb thing.  He doesn't have the Storm, Jimmy.  He has the Storm 2.  Storm 2.  That's what he meant.  Twice as shitty.  It sounded like velociraptors in your kitchen.  That fucking hunk of shit. 
[00:15:00]  That clicking.  It's like the buttons are intuitive.  You feel them.  You need a tactile input.  No.  No, you don't.  Dude, when I was going left, right, left, right, you know how fucking annoying?  BlackBerry people, they're tech people.  If they're listening, you should really hang yourselves.  You're not good people.  Well, with that, we've got to go to the phones.  First of all, you heard that BlackBerry's trying to do their BBM.  BBM, thank you, for the iPhone and the droids.  They want to move that technology. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Because they're desperate now.  They're like, well, I know.  They know that a lot of people have it still for the BBM.  So they're like, well, why don't we just give the technology to the other phone providers?  Honestly, what's the difference between getting a BBM and a text?  Nothing anymore.  There was a time.  It was just cool because it was separate and it had its nice little fucking icon.  I can't argue the point anymore.  I'm agreeing with you.  Like, I look, and I look at fuck off here.  There was a time.  Let me just look at a text.  Fuck off.  I get it.  There was a time it was just cool to kind of just be with your BlackBerry pals. 
[00:16:00]  Really?  And yes.  That was cool.  That was nice.  Yesterday, there was an article going around about the BBM on Android and iOS platforms.  So of course, I got to bust Keith's balls about it because he's always spouting off about  the BBM.  So this is his words.  So this is him explaining why he keeps it.  It says it's about communicating with people in a business circle that prefer that form  of communication.  So if it's about the other people, not necessarily what you want, it's about what everyone else 
[00:16:30]  has to make your life easier.  It was like just putting it in a folder.  Yeah, I guess so.  Because the BBM people, you had to accept a friend request and all that, whatever.  Really?  Accept contact or whatever.  So yeah, it kind of had your folder of fucking BlackBerry people.  And like Keith said, it was a lot of the people that you work with.  I understand it, I just don't get the appeal of it.  Exactly.  I don't want a folder of BlackBerry people.  It doesn't make sense anymore because the texting and all that has gotten way better 
[00:17:00]  in general.  Yeah.  But with BBM, because I mean, I used to have a BlackBerry years ago and I would never even  use the BBM function because I was like, well, I don't understand what's the difference  between this and either texting me or just getting me on like, you know, instant messenger.  It's like the same thing.  Say it again, in the year 2011, there's no difference, but there was a time that it  just kind of just made sense.  Ah, days gone by.  Because I used to get text messages from, you know, from junk text messages and all that  shit too.  And from people I didn't want to fucking hear from.  Do you know, I had a folder. 
[00:17:30]  If you know what I mean.  I had a folder of BlackBerry messengers, people.  Yeah.  And I threw it away.  Let me see.  Someone's saying I have to wait for the Motorola Bionic.  What the fuck is that?  Kevin in Oklahoma.  Kevin.  Great.  Good morning, boys.  Dude, YouTube's Motorola Bionic.  It's got a one gig dual core PC grade processor.  This is going to be the phone.  The iPhone killer? 
[00:18:00]  The iPhone killer?  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm not saying the iPhone killer.  But just check it out.  Just go on YouTube, check it out.  They announced it at CES in Vegas last month.  This is going to be a really cool phone.  Yeah, dude, I'm looking at it right now.  It looks like every other Android phone I've ever seen.  It's pretty sweet.  Well, no, I know.  Pretty sweet.  Check it out.  This thing's going to be, it's pretty cool.  Wow, it's got like a flat touch screen.  It's those four dedicated touch buttons on the bottom.  Right.  Whatever the current Android OS is. 
[00:18:30]  When is it coming out?  In about a month.  Wait, they don't, what does Android use as an operating system?  That is the operating system.  That's why when you see news articles that say Android dominates BlackBerry and iOS for market share,  it's because the Android is an operating system, whereas BlackBerry and iPhone is hardware.  So when you have one operating system over multiple platforms of hardware, of course they're going to dominate market share.  Different types of phones, yeah.  So it was kind of a tricky way to, were they really ahead of the iPhone or no?  Well, if iPhone says here, Motorola, Bionic, and here, HTC, Evo, whatever, you could use the iOS platform. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  I don't think that Android would be having the market share.  Right.  But they don't.  All right, I'll look at the Bionic.  Here's BlackBerry's new phone, by the way.  I do know about this.  Oh, no.  I just got to wait to hear this.  Travis in Kentucky.  Oh, no.  Travis.  Hi, Alex.  Hey, I'm a BlackBerry guy.  I went to the Sprint store, looked at a new BlackBerry.  It's a goddamn flip phone.  What is it, a StarTek? 
[00:19:30]  Or StarTek?  I think they're giving up.  I don't know.  A flip phone?  I don't believe you.  I swear.  What year is this?  I saw the BlackBerry flip.  That's old, though.  No, there's a newer version of that.  Is there really?  The one I saw.  Oh, they're just heavy.  Any reason for buttons anymore?  I don't know.  In any way, shape, or form?  I don't know what they're doing.  Dude, I fought it.  I didn't want to get rid of the, what did you say, the tactile?  You're right.  Yeah, yeah.  You get used to touching something and feeling buttons, and I got used to that.  But after a while, predictive text on the iPhone is actually pretty good. 
[00:20:00]  I get so pissed off, though, that it says shot every time I try to type shit.  Understandable.  And I type shit a lot.  But so many, and also say it.  Yes.  And fuck never comes out.  It's fic.  Yeah.  Or something.  It's like, ah.  Okay.  You hit send and you're mad because you said something was bullshot.  This guy's got to explain why BBM is better than texting.  Oh, cool.  Alex in Boston.  Thank God. 
[00:20:30]  Is that the newer version?  Yeah.  See, there is a BlackBerry flip.  I don't know what they're doing.  Look at that thing.  I'm not buying that.  They stink.  That looks like it's from the 90s.  It's a, yeah, and then because it opens up, it's twice as big as the current BlackBerry.  They're fucking horrid.  What are they doing?  They want you to have the buttons on the bottom or not commit to having the buttons.  I was a customer.  I wanted to continue with you guys.  That screen looks awful.  They stink.  They make me angry.  I'm angry now.  I'm mad too.  I'm angry. 
[00:21:00]  What the fuck are they doing?  Why am I mad?  I don't know why I care.  I'm mad that exists.  But dude, look.  Two screens, dude.  Oh, and you shut it.  Then the front is a real shitty resolution screen.  Oh my God.  What are they doing?  The iPhone screen is like a fucking computer monitor.  Dude, you're holding glass in your face and magic comes from it.  They had me though.  I was a customer.  Faithful customer.  They're sitting there waiting for the new phone every six months. 
[00:21:30]  You know how you feel about the iPad?  I held out to it first as long as you did and I was like, fuck it, man.  I got it.  Good.  And you liked it?  Yeah.  The same with the iPhone, man.  It's better now than it was when it first came out.  Once you have it, it's like fucking, you can't, I cannot imagine getting another phone.  And I was get a new phone guy like every couple of months.  I was looking at something going, oh, I want that one.  I want that one.  I wouldn't even think twice about getting another iPhone.  Especially with Verizon on board.  Last night with the people I was out with, I had explained the pebble again. 
[00:22:00]  Jesus Christ.  The only thing that, that should have been skipped across a pond like a pebble.  I might have to take a picture of my pebble.  The pebble.  You still have it?  Oh yeah, it just sits at my desk.  Looks like a big suppository.  Do you say, I save all the phones.  I don't.  I do too.  I got a fucking drawer full.  This one, I just haven't thrown it away for whatever reason.  It's useless.  Yeah, save that one.  That's a key part.  I got to take a picture because I remember the day I brought it in to break to all you guys.  And I did get a few wows.  It's like, look at this.  At the time. 
[00:22:30]  At the time I did.  I remember those.  And then the technology quickly changed like literally the next week.  And everyone started going to the smartphones.  Yeah, because you got a look on your face whenever someone asked like, well, what does it do?  And you're like, uh.  I just said it looked cool.  It looks cool and it could make a call with it.  It felt like you were carrying around a really soft rock in your back pocket.  It was a nice feeling.  It felt good in your pocket.  But it was the last, I'll say, sort of cool phone before the smartphones took over. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Because you got to remember when that pebble came out, no one was doing the fucking iPhone  crap and the BlackBerry crap.  It was very rare to find a phone that did anything except make calls and texts.  The trios were out.  The trios were out with the big, thick antenna.  Yeah.  You know, so the smartphones were starting to develop.  So this was the last cool phone before the smartphones, in my opinion.  What about the Palm?  Remember the Palm Pilot?  The Palm was out.  But it was too much going on.  And it wasn't even a phone.  Like, you just, you needed that and your phone.  Like, they were able to finally get everything, your iPod, everything in one thing. 
[00:23:30]  But there was a crossroad where people wanted a smaller phone, because you did have the Palm  Pilots and the trios and sort of BlackBerry.  And people were confused.  They're like, I want a small, a really small phone.  And then the argument was, why would you carry that around when you could do all that on your  computer?  Yeah.  But then people were like, no, you don't understand.  You could do everything that you could do on your computer on the phone.  You know what I mean?  It was like, there was a definite crossroad which direction it was going to go. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  It had to balance out the size of the phone.  Right.  And what it can do.  Right.  So, and again, I'll fucking crow about that.  And then all of a sudden, one day we said, fuck having a small phone.  Who cares?  Yeah.  I want to be able to do more on my phone.  As long as it fits in my pocket.  Right.  Yeah, I don't care if it's any smaller.  I'm a stylus.  But remember, everyone was obsessed with getting the phone smaller and smaller.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then that just went away overnight.  The stylus.  If anyone has a stylus anymore, take it and plunge it into your face. 
[00:24:30]  Then blow off Rich Voss because he only got rid of that stylus probably a year ago.  Dude, you can't be friends with people with stylus.  No.  Is he coming in today?  A stylus.  I bet you he got rid of the stylus about a year ago.  Practice was too big for his hands.  And everyone would lose their stylus.  They're like, oh, I lost my stylus.  The stylus.  The guy was going to explain the BBM thing, but we just battled too long, so we lost them.  Oh, BBWs.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  What is that thing?  That's the Apple Newton. 
[00:25:00]  The Newton.  Yeah, that was the innovator.  That was before Palm Pilots.  That was before...  That looks like...  One of Apple's monumental flops, but really they were just kind of way ahead of the time.  But it looks like a combo of an iPad and an iPhone, kind of.  They're a little confused there.  Yeah.  Look that up at home for yourself.  You see the antenna on top, too?  Yeah.  There's a lot of hardware there.  There was a flop, Danny?  What's up?  There was a flop.  Huge.  When did it come out?  I don't remember.  I got to check.  I got to check.  I don't know.  It was kind of like...  I think it was like mid-90s.  I like the monochrome display. 
[00:25:30]  What is it, though?  What would it do?  It's like a PDA.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't remember that.  Keep your phone contacts in there.  It was like a Palm Pilot.  You keep your contacts, your calendar, all that stuff.  Oh, my God.  Fucking Palm Pilot.  Yeah, the Palm Pilot.  Remember that?  That had a stylus.  That guy that we had...  Who was the guy we had, the genius guy, who thinks we're all going to be computers by April?  I was trying...  Ray Kurzweil.  What?  Ray Kurzweil?  Yeah, yeah.  The great Criswell?  He was on the cover of Time this month.  Yeah.  And he's right about technology reinventing itself, because literally, you forget... 
[00:26:00]  That was right around the corner.  That wasn't that long ago.  This was impressive stuff.  What year was that, Danny?  The Palm Pilot.  71, maybe?  The Newton.  The develop of the Newton platform started in 87 and ended in 98.  Damn.  The Newtons were in 98.  The Apple Newton...  The one that we were looking at is called the Apple Newton Message Pad 2100.  2100?  That sounds good.  Do you think anyone uses that in the country?  Is there any of those active in the country right now?  That would be like...  Maybe for nostalgic purposes. 
[00:26:30]  Ironically.  Yeah, you know, yeah.  Ironically.  Someone owns it ironically.  In Brooklyn.  Yeah, absolutely.  In Brooklyn.  Absolutely.  In Brooklyn.  But no, some people just hold on to shit forever.  Speaking of PBR.  Yeah.  Oh, you guys want to hear the Game Changer?  Got it right here.  Game Changer.  By the way, the Game Changer, Drew, and...  Yes.  Sorry, just real quick.  The first one of these hardware, Newton's, came out in 93, so...  Okay, 93.  Drew in Jersey.  What's up, Drew?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Drew.  Hey.  So, the professor at UC Berkeley did his whole speech recently about how any technology 
[00:27:00]  that really changes in the face of how we do things has to fit in your pocket, right?  And all these tablets, they're great, but they're too fucking big.  They don't fit in your pocket.  And supposedly, the story right now is that Blackberry's coming out with a tablet thing  that does fit in your pocket.  They're supposed to literally change the game.  It's an iPhone.  Yeah, it's Blackberry.  It's not.  Yeah, exactly.  It's a fucking...  It's a coupon for an iPad. 
[00:27:30]  No, you know what he might be talking about?  This is what will change the game when they figure this out, and they haven't yet.  The screens and stuff that can be rolled out.  Rich wants attention.  Oh, right, right, right.  Everyone look at his ass.  That's great.  Thanks, Rich.  Keep him out of here.  He said he got rid of his stylus a year ago.  Yeah, okay.  A year ago.  I told you.  That's still too fucking long.  So, Drew, what is this?  The Game Changer?  Yeah.  I don't know what the name of it is yet.  I don't think they've released actually a name.  But the Blackberry tablet, which is supposed to be coming out this summer, it's really what  they're putting all of their efforts towards right now. 
[00:28:00]  It's trying to crack that whole market and come up with something that actually fits in  your pocket, but does everything that a tablet does.  So, the screen is going to be bigger than the iPhone.  So, now their Blackberry is just going to be larger.  It's in between.  Look, I'm looking at something now online.  You can't be in between the two technologies.  It's in between.  I mean, it's too small for a tablet, and it's too big for a phone.  Yes, I agree with you.  The Blackberry tablet doesn't work, because they've already said, like, to get your email  on the Blackberry tablet, you have to have a Bluetooth connection to your Blackberry. 
[00:28:30]  It's true.  So, you have to have your Blackberry in your hand.  Fucking horrible.  We're all in a rage.  Blackberry ruined our day.  I'm fucking done.  I'm angry.  Look, I'm done.  Break it.  I'm fucking...  Break it.  I got it.  I don't even know if I could go a day without a phone at this point.  When you leave it at home now, it's like, what the fuck?  It's the worst feeling.  I'm totally...  I'm not connected. 
[00:29:00]  You feel like you're not plugged into the world?  What's the worst feeling?  And that's why I didn't get a beeper back in the day.  I'm like, I want to be able to fucking not have to be connected all the time.  Hit me on the hip, motherfucker.  What a dumb idea that was.  When are we...  What's your call?  It's coming out.  The new iPhones that Verizon can get.  Summer?  June.  June?  June.  All right.  Drew, thanks for the game changer.  We're all hearing about that Blackberry tablet.  Yeah, we're all going to get the playbook when it comes out. 
[00:29:30]  Basically, you have to have your cell phone in your pocket.  Wait till it vibrates to let you know you have an email, and then get your tablet.  And then get your tablet.  That can't be possible.  They have to be connected because Blackberry is worried about security or something.  I don't know exactly what their rationale was, but you have to have your Blackberry on you.  I don't believe you at all.  Here's what their rationale is.  They're afraid that their obsolete phones are going to be even more obsolete with their fucking 6x9 tablet. 
[00:30:00]  What are you doing?  What is that?  It's too small.  It has wheels on it.  It's a wagon.  It's a fucking wagon.  You can put rocks on it and pull them.  It's the worst.  I love it.  It's too small for a tablet and too big for a phone.  You know, who's in charge of the technology?  Steve Jobs.  I bet you Steve Jobs actually just sends them all their tech suggestions.  No, no, no, no, no.  Go bigger on the phone.  Yeah, bigger phone.  Smaller on the tablet.  It'll rule.  When they figure this out, when they figure out how to unroll, like they will eventually 
[00:30:30]  figure out a thing that can be put in your pocket that unrolls to tablet-sized screen  that's perfect quality.  That will fucking kill everything.  But until that happens.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or projection things that are absolutely perfect to work on every surface.  Those are the things that will kill everything.  You can't have a device that's in between the iPad and a phone right now.  You just can't do that.  No.  No.  Stupid.  I don't want a bigger...  Sam is actually absolutely right.  I'm reading all about it.  Come on.  That can't be possible.  I told you.  I don't lie. 
[00:31:00]  How stupid is this company?  You do lie.  Unable to access corporate email without a tethered BlackBerry device will be a blow to  enterprise users.  Enterprise?  Why would they do that?  Because they're dumb.  But it does say, on the other hand, it shouldn't have much effect on non-corporate users.  Who would have access to their Hotmail, Gmail, whatever.  Web-based.  So you have to go to the web-based Gmail?  I don't know.  Like you have to open the browser?  Oh, God.  No, I'm sure the device itself could probably get to Gmail servers. 
[00:31:30]  I think what they mean is for company emails.  Why would they do that, though?  Because most people using BlackBerrys are corporate guys.  So why would they make the corporate guys have the BlackBerry and that?  That doesn't make sense.  The iPad was...  That's the only reason people are keeping their stupid BlackBerrys.  The iPad was marketed as being in between an iPhone and a computer.  So why would you now have to have another in-between?  There's more.  There's room for another in-between.  It's so stupid.  BlackBerry is dumb.  I'm hoping Monday I got that Droid, man.  I'm going to try it. 
[00:32:00]  Or at least look at it today.  The Atrix.  If anyone has any feedback on that, I'd appreciate it.  And then, you know, of course, then I'll finally do the right thing and get the iPhone.  You should wait until June, anyway.  So between now and June, I'll try out the fucking Atrix.  It's all a write-off, dude.  It's all a write-off anyway.  Any technology you fuck with for the show is a write-off.  Sure.  All right, guys.  We should take our first break.  We've got a very busy show today.  Extremely busy.  Yes.  I miss...  Troy Kwan's song just went viral, I heard.  Yeah.  I mean, it got some web... 
[00:32:30]  Yep.  Whatever.  Some web traffic.  Does Troy know this?  I don't know.  I didn't talk to him this morning, but I saw it on some pretty major websites.  All right.  We'll talk about Troy Kwan's song going viral.  Yeah.  The one we made fun of is actually going viral.  Amazing.  I mean, we were wrong again.  We have to take our lumps, as they say.  We'll explain next.  And eat some crow.  We were being sarcastic when we said it was good.  I know.  And I found something very interesting in the paper today.  The world's most typical human being.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  What would you think that is?  Like, if you just imagine...  There's plenty of jokes to be made, certainly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I also want to realize...  The world's most typical human being...  Most typical human being.  What the picture of a typical earthling would look like.  Remember when we used to have to do what our typical listener looks like?  Yes.  It's the same thing, but this is for the world.  The world.  A woman who finds me sexually repulsive.  That'd be it.  Let the jokes begin.  Someone smarter than boss.  What do you think the world's most typical human being is? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  How old?  What does he look like?  Yeah.  What does he do?  Right.  How much he makes?  Yep.  World's most typical human being.  Something to think about during the break.  Muslim?  Biggest religion in the world?  25?  25-year-old Muslim?  How much does he make?  Is that in there, right?  Yeah, well...  Low.  It's a low amount of money, probably.  Average yearly income.  What do you think the average yearly income of the typical human being?  Islam is very big in the Middle East and certain parts of Africa. 
[00:34:00]  I'm probably way off.  How much a year?  40,000.  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Typical.  Average.  $20,000 a year.  So you're saying 25-year-old Muslim man?  I'm probably 100% wrong.  I'm just...  Making $25,000 a year?  Let's say the price is wrong.  You can adjust a little if you want.  I'm not giving $8,000.  No, I know you're not.  I'm just thinking of...  You might be right on.  ...of African countries and a lot of...  Like, Pakistan, they don't make... 
[00:34:30]  No, you know what?  $8,000 a year.  $8,000?  25-year-old Muslim that makes $8,000 a year.  Yeah.  Okay.  And I'm sure I'm probably way off.  Oh, you know what?  You know what it could be?  You know what?  Uh-oh.  He's honing.  No, no, no, no.  He's honing.  Asian.  Asian.  Asian female.  Asian female.  Asian female makes how much?  30-year-old Asian female.  30-year-old Asian female.  Making $8,000 a year.  What are you fucking asking for? 
[00:35:00]  Are you on Craigslist?  Oh, yeah.  Am I speaking out loud?  Oops.  Making how much?  I'm just laughing because it's completely different from the first guest.  $8,000 a year.  $8,000.  Are we writing these down?  All right.  So now it's a 30-year-old Asian woman making $8,000 a year.  All right.  Uh-huh.  All right.  We're going to tell you what the world's most...  You're going to have another guest.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Six-foot-nine Mexican man with blonde hair making $2.3 billion a month. 
[00:35:30]  A month.  All right.  Only half circumcised.  We got our first radio tease.  The world's most typical human being.  We'll tell you who that person is after the break.  Troy Kwan's viral Charlie Sheen song.  And, of course, Car Crash Comedy a little later this morning.  And Kevin Smith stopping by.  So, very busy today.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Attention, college students.  Are you having trouble punching up that term paper? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, my professor is killing me.  Need to doctor your dissertation?  Oh, man, would I ever.  Impress your professors with a flurry of words from the new Vossipedia Online.  Awesome!  Simply type in your question, and Vossipedia spits out the appropriate terminology.  What's the capital of Georgia?  Alana.  Wow, it's so easy!  Man, I can't remember the name of the U.S. prison in Cuba.  Guatemala Bay.  Oh, that's right.  Vossipedia Online is the most useful research tool since the paperweight.  What's the name of that mountain with the president's faces? 
[00:36:30]  Mountain in Rushmore.  Oh, man, I'm a fucking idiot, of course!  What festivity is celebrated with booze and muggings in New Orleans?  Mardi Gras.  Here comes another A.  Stetter, stammer, and slobber your way through college with helpful hints from Vossipedia Online.  What does IQ stand for?  Intellectual quiz.  Man, this is a lifesaver!  Thanks, Vossipedia!  Vossipedia!  Vossipedia!  Vossipedia Media Online.  Good morning.  Thanks for calling Radio Shack.  My name is Danny.  How can I help you?  I used to have the thing on my... 
[00:37:00]  Yeah?  ...into your router settings.  Okay, so I log in.  I find this shit right there.  Yeah, exactly right.  So get in there and then, you know, make sure that your Wi-Fi is enabled.  But where do you fucking wire it into?  Well, I mean, it should just be wired right from your cable modem.  It should just be right in there.  Yeah.  Why?  How do you know that?  Because that's just how it works.  Are you talking about the hot, the heavy, thick wire you're talking about?  You mean like a Cat5?  You're talking about a...  You know, Ethernet cable?  Yeah, they call them, I think they call them hot wires.  Fire wire?  Fire wire.  Dude, do you need like a universal AC adapter or a soldering iron? 
[00:37:30]  What's that?  Dude, I just, let me just get back to work, man.  Like, can you open a browser and get to the web?  So it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Yeah, yeah, it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Are you on the web?  Okay, so now...  Can you go to a website?  Can you do that?  You hook it up, okay?  Are you listening?  Are you listening to me?  Can you open a browser and go to your homepage?  Is it that easy?  Yes!  Click.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah, I see it.  Bingo.  We have a winner.  Is that it?  Is that it for good?  Am I set for life? 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, yeah, that's it, dude.  Yeah, yeah, that's it.  Thank you for helping me.  Yeah, man, no problem, dude.  There were some other tech questions I needed.  Oh, oh, Facebook.  No, no, no, no.  No, no!  I'm up to my limit of friends.  No!  If you want a cordless phone or some LEDs, fine.  I'm up to my limit of friends.  Five, I'm not helping you.  I think somebody's set up a fan page.  I'm hanging up!  How do I get people to go there?  Instead of sending me friend requests.  Sirius XM, the virus.  Yeah, this is the O.P. Dan Anthony Show.  Damn it.  Very busy day. 
[00:38:30]  I just walked by the fishbowl, and the listeners are there and ready to go for Car Crash Comedy.  Yes.  And one of the contestants is in studio.  Yeah.  What's your name, sir?  Hello.  And how long have you been doing comedy?  You know, this is crazy.  I bought my car in the shop the other day. 
[00:39:00]  I had to get a rental car.  And it had Sirius, and I don't have Sirius in my car.  And I'm listening.  Sirius?  Sirius?  I said Sirius.  Sirius?  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  So I'm listening to Raw Dog or the comedy, and even though you're jaded, I'm going,  oh, this stinks.  This stinks.  And I'm listening.  I'm going, this really stinks.  And then it hits me.  It was me.  I'm going, God, what a lesb.  Who would talk like that?  This guy sucks.  He's horrible.  So I kept giving it.  I go, let me give it another shot. 
[00:39:30]  And it didn't turn me around on me.  How hot is this fucking gossip girl?  I didn't know she was only 17.  She was in the other day.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was taping for the boneyard, and I'm fucking sitting in the glass studio.  Taylor Momsen.  Dude, I look out, and literally she's taking pictures with, like, Roland and the guys,  and her fucking ass cheeks are hanging out of her dress.  I had to go out and get a shot with her.  She is fucking sexy, man.  She's great.  I don't know how tall she is.  Yeah, she's great.  Very leggy.  Do you ever think the girl yesterday was sexy? 
[00:40:00]  I loved her.  Mailin Ackerman?  She was phenomenal.  I loved her.  Phenomenal.  I don't know who you're talking about, so I'm trying to, like, compare to decide who's  hotter.  That chick right there.  Yeah, I noticed that too.  Look at that.  I mean, come on.  What's that?  Her thumbs.  Her awful thumbs.  Who cares?  Mailin, yeah.  Look how nice.  See how thick, when that went into your ass, you will definitely feel it.  It would get stuck in there, though.  Immediately.  Yeah, me too.  Yeah, try to find something wrong with her.  You just noticed it, though, but it's not even to try to find it.  It just happens to her.  I didn't even, I wasn't looking at her hands. 
[00:40:30]  I saw that picture.  I'm like, oh my God.  What is going on?  Yeah, those bulbous thumbs.  That didn't matter, though.  Megan Fox has them.  Nah, whatever.  Where you going?  Where you going?  He's a little gal.  Yeah.  I don't have them.  Conscious of us.  Oh, yeah.  Let me see if no one looks at you.  What, your thumbs?  I got stubby thumbs, too.  Yeah.  He's a little thumb.  There might be other people in my family that have it worse.  Whenever he throws a punch, his thumb just flops out because there's not enough tuck.  I got to awkwardly curl the one nail a little longer so it looks like a real thumbnail. 
[00:41:00]  That's a little guy.  And then the right one's sort of okay.  That's a little guy.  That's a little guy.  He got little guy thumbs.  You should be happy you're the race that has thumbs.  Jesus, Rich.  Rich Voss, everyone.  Rich Voss.  But, you know, could be a lizard.  Kevin Smith's going to be here very soon, too.  And then we're going to move over to the fishbowl to do some comedy.  Right. 
[00:41:30]  So we're looking for the world's most typical human being.  You got an answer for this, Rich?  The most typical in the world?  Well, I think the entire world.  How old is the person?  What does he look like?  How much does he make a year?  The average earthling.  I'll tell you the truth.  And I tweeted this or whatever you call it.  I was on the plane the other day coming back from Atlanta.  And there was a guy.  He must have been 37, 38.  We're in first class.  I'm upgraded or bumped up.  And I'm sitting there and he's watching two and a half men and he's laughing. 
[00:42:00]  And I wanted to just fucking put a shiv in his fucking neck.  I'm going, you're an adult and you're laughing at this.  So that's your typical fucking American that would just sit and laugh at two and a half men  but probably be offended by Patrice or Louis C.K.  It's not as two and a half men.  I watched the episode one time and I wanted to hate it.  It's not that bad.  The writing was actually edgier than most sitcoms.  I was surprised by some of the lines they did.  But just the key word sitcom.  Yeah, they take a few more chances and they're a little edgier than the average sitcom. 
[00:42:30]  I still wouldn't watch weekly but I did take a peek too.  It's not that bad.  He's the typical guy.  What do you think?  Typical, world's most typical human being.  Yeah.  You got a typical human being.  What's the makeup?  For example.  If they walked in here, what would they be?  Jimmy has two answers.  A 25-year-old Muslim that makes, what do you say?  8,000 a year.  8,000 a year or a 30-year-old Asian woman that makes...  8,000 a year.  8,000.  8,000.  Same pay.  Oh, it was the same pay? 
[00:43:00]  I stuck to that, yeah.  And what about the Mexican guy though?  What do you think are typical?  The most common person right now on the planet.  Yeah, what would be the most common person on the planet?  It's safe to say he's not Jewish.  An anti-Semite.  Wait a minute.  You know what?  He's probably a designer in fucking Italy.  Oh, yes.  You know what?  It's a fucking baby.  A baby?  Really?  Yeah, or a youngster.  Or Uncle Paul.  No, it's a youngster.  A youngster?  Yes.  So what's the makeup?  Age and income? 
[00:43:30]  An Asian youngster with no income.  Asian youngster, no income is the, like, that would be the average earthling.  The most common earthling right now.  Oh, and we forgot the most important part of this quiz.  His demeanor.  Oh, right, right.  Cries a lot.  I said...  A crying baby.  That's Anthony.  I fucked up by saying his demeanor.  So it is a guy.  So that's part of the puzzle. 
[00:44:00]  So it is a guy.  Final answers.  I don't know.  I'll stick with my...  I want to know what Rich would think.  Instead of an Asian female, Asian male.  Asian male.  30.  Typical.  I don't understand.  Typical.  Most common type of person.  Like, what is the most common human in the planet?  See, we're stupid.  We're saying...  Are you saying the most numbers-wise you're going Asian?  You're just a dumb man.  I'm just a dumb man.  Why am I a dumb man?  Typical is...  What does typical mean? 
[00:44:30]  It's the most...  Typical is a guy...  No, that's...  Typical.  Muslims are not typical.  They're extremists, most of them, or...  No, but that's the most common religion.  So it's common, not typical.  There's a difference between common and typical.  Not really.  Not in this sense.  Not in this sense.  We mean the most common.  You're just talking the most...  Yeah.  You're really...  Yeah.  Just...  What do you think?  See, in our dumb world, we think it's a white guy, because that's all we basically know.  But for the whole world, what is it?  Most common, fine. 
[00:45:00]  Then it would have to be, throughout the world, Muslim, because there's more of every fucking  where.  And how old is the Muslim?  Well, okay, probably, like...  I would say 21, 19 years old.  19-year-old Muslim.  Okay.  How much does he make?  Under the table.  Let's get the answers.  How did you ruin an already awful quiz?  Oh, my God. 
[00:45:30]  Jimmy has fun answers.  One of Jimmy's answers was a 6'9 Mexican that makes $2.3 billion a month.  Yeah, but I still say it with glasses.  No, with a monocle.  That was a monocle.  Well, the headline is, Chinese men are mean.  The world's most typical human being is a 28-year-old Han, Han, Han, Chinese man who  speaks Mandarin and owns a cell phone. 
[00:46:00]  National Geographic found that the Hans are the world's largest ethnic group.  28 is the world's median age, and most people own cell phones.  So I was right, almost, when I said 30-year-old woman.  I mean, Asian, I was right.  They were pretty close.  In their massive study, the magazine also found that there are more men than women worldwide,  just barely, so it's very close.  More right-handers than there are left-handers.  And the average person makes less than $12,000 a year.  The average human being makes less than $12,000 a year. 
[00:46:30]  That's why I was kind of close with age.  Did you guys get together and decide on this bit together?  It's not a bit, it's a little bit of information.  It's fucking the worst filler I've ever done in this radio station, okay?  You guys are fucking angry.  But less than 25% of the world's population has a bank account.  Less?  How do you know that?  Yeah.  Less than 25%.  How do they go to check catching?  The average male height in Holland is 5'11".  Peru's typical man is just 5'4 1⁄2".  Oh, shit, I'd be a giant over here.  Short people. 
[00:47:00]  Women in Japan typically live to the age of 86.  Women in Afghanistan, want to guess?  I'm 30.  45.  No.  Average woman in Afghanistan makes it to 45.  You've got to be shitting me.  And then it goes on to, oh, this is actually bad.  The average American uses 100 gallons of water at home per day,  while people in parts of Ethiopia use just 2 1⁄2 gallons of water each day. 
[00:47:30]  Well, dig a fucking well, you goddamn assholes.  God, do something.  We're just using all the water in America.  We don't use 100 gallons.  That picture Danny has the world's most typical humor.  It's just a really mean Asian guy's face.  Yeah.  And if you pay him back, he's next to a traffic accident.  I just kind of kicked off an idol last night.  Looking ahead, the study says that the 28th year old.  I got it.  Han man won't be typical for long.  By 2030, the most typical person in the world will be from India. 
[00:48:00]  So we're fucking in the minority.  We are complete minority.  Minority.  The white man is the minority.  We don't talk about fucking minorities.  Huh?  Fucking, we're the biggest minority in the world.  And yet, retards?  I knew a joke was coming because his neck threw out like, oh, whatever.  Oh, boy.  My neck threw out like one.  I have a very, very bad neck rate.  I'm sore today.  You have a very bad neck.  I'm sore.  Yeah. 
[00:48:30]  What happened?  How big was it?  Uh, thickness or length?  Dude, I napped.  I fucking, I hurt my neck napping.  Right, that could happen.  I was just, I woke up and it's like, it's, oh, it hurts.  In my back.  I would ask you to rub it, but you're a fucking vermin.  Can you rub his neck for him, Rick?  Oh, it's my back.  I wouldn't rub my wife's neck.  How am I going to rub his fucking neck?  I forgot you don't like human contact.  Oh, it's fucking ridiculous.  You don't rub Bonnie's neck?  Oh, not nothing.  She asked me to rub her feet.  I put on gloves. 
[00:49:00]  Do you at least touch your own wife?  A little.  A little, right?  Nobody wants to rub their nasty fucking, suck feet.  You don't suck feet?  Are her feet awful?  Ugh, what are you kidding me?  From walking around the fucking farm as a kid?  And fucking pig shit and stuff.  Whatever.  I don't like touching, you know, that's, you know, that whole, it's over fucking rated.  There's nothing, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh.  Rich, you need a hug.  Jimmy, you want to give me a hug?  No, I know.  There's nothing.  What's this?  Ugh.  Rich was like, what's overrated? 
[00:49:30]  It's just ridiculous.  Touching?  Yeah, it's stupid.  He has Asperger's, boss.  He's a weird autism.  Asperger's.  He has a weird autism without that whole ability to do anything with your mind.  He's like Rain Man if he couldn't add or count.  He's like, look, try to touch him.  Look, what happened?  He has a good neck.  Yes, you do have a good neck, but what's above it is worthless.  Just try to touch Rich.  I love touching Rich.  Try to touch, see, look.  He's so creepy.  Yeah, he doesn't like it.  He's backing away.  It's not creepy. 
[00:50:00]  When you go to fucking 12-step meetings and certain, and I even break it.  Yeah, I got it.  You know, they want to, first of all, at the end, they want to hold hands.  Right at the end, they hold hands, and that's when I go to the bathroom.  Okay.  Why do you have to hold hands?  Are you a germ freak?  A little bit better.  He's made me a fucking germ freak.  I can't stand Voss.  But why would you hold hands?  I'm not into it.  To do the fucking Lord's Prayer.  Lately, it's just a thing they do at the end.  Do you have to, though?  No, none of you don't do anything.  No, that's why I shoot you to the bathroom.  And then also, another 12-step film, they always want to hug you. 
[00:50:30]  You know, give me a hug.  Well, that's the famous scene from Fight Club with Meatloaf.  Where they want to hug you.  I mean, it wasn't an AA meeting, but...  If I knew I had a hug, I wouldn't be in re-fucking-covery.  Well, that's what it is.  It's people who have only had unhealthy physical contact.  A hug of a friend is nice physical contact.  That's probably what the big...  People like to be touched in a nice way.  Really?  Yes.  I don't know if I said it on your station.  I don't understand, like, when people...  I said on your station.  On your program.  On your program. 
[00:51:00]  Whatever.  I don't know if I said it here.  How about Amplitude?  Or you guys were doing fucking, you know, page seven filler from the Post.  I don't know.  All I know is I hate when fucking people say, and strange people go, I love you.  Like, when callers call in, they go, I love you.  Yeah, yeah.  How do you say that to anybody?  Exactly.  No, here's what it is.  How does mother not say it to you?  Huh?  Just, look, this is all about your horrendous childhood.  No, Sean, I'm not trying to...  What's wrong with you?  If someone just says, I love you, who cares?  He knows they can't mean it.  Would you say to a stranger or to an actor, I love you? 
[00:51:30]  Yes, I've said that many times.  Ozzy Osbourne, I love you.  I love you.  You're the best.  Absolutely.  They don't mean love in the love sense.  It's just any disdain of words.  Yeah, it's like...  It's just a compliment.  It's used too loosely.  Don't you understand?  You really like what they do.  We've heard a million times, love you guys.  Yeah, don't you love pizza?  It's like, you have no commonality of language, understanding?  Oh, I love that movie.  It doesn't mean they want to stick a dick in your eye.  But when you say to a person, hey, I love you guys.  Well, why don't you marry him? 
[00:52:00]  Why don't you stop acting like the words have such impact?  I love you is...  We all understand the meaning of that.  That's a nice throwaway.  Yeah.  I don't think twice about it.  It's like, oh, that's cool.  We got to...  I love being here, but I don't love saying it.  That makes sense.  What a horrible...  What a loveless childhood he had.  Yeah.  Kind of sad.  Loveless.  I turned it around.  No, you didn't.  With my kids.  You're a loveless man.  And that's why...  No, I love my kids.  But they don't love you.  But you don't touch them.  Do you touch them? 
[00:52:30]  Hug them?  Oh, yeah.  My little daughter, I can't stop kissing her and playing with her.  It's fucking great, man.  She's so...  Me neither.  I just went, oh, wow.  Look at that.  Really?  Why?  No, I know.  Why?  You're right.  Daddy, I played with this guy who had Brillo on his head.  Daddy, his hair cut me, Daddy.  No, I do.  My kids, you know, I mean, my older daughters, you know, I give them a hug and stuff, but 
[00:53:00]  it's, you know, at some point when your kids get older, it gets, you know...  A little awkward.  You know, last week, two weeks ago when I was in Baltimore, my daughter was in town  and came to this show with like six of her friends.  And they're like, these fucking girls, they're all 21...  Baltimore friends?  No, they're from...  They go to college now.  Oh, so...  They're like smoking, but I'm talking...  I can't even look at them in the face because I'm talking about eating jizz off of my stomach.  Oh, man.  And your daughter's in the audience?  With her friends.  It's like, that's your dad? 
[00:53:30]  You don't have enough jokes where you can take that one out?  I have hours of stuff.  Take that one out if your daughter's in the...  No, that's a good one, man.  You can't take it out.  You gotta go...  You can't sacrifice...  You had a jizz-eating joke in front of your own daughter?  Well, I did not.  You're all...  But you don't want to hug anybody.  You're a fucking weirdo, man.  You know, I do the...  What the fuck's wrong with you?  I do the bit about...  I can't be your friend.  Put my dick...  I knew that after you didn't respond to 12 calls. 
[00:54:00]  Get the hint.  Because you'll call another 12.  Let's get it on the table.  Enough already.  Where's Kevin?  Is he here?  I am here.  Okay.  Here we just come in.  Last night...  Wait.  So you have jizz jokes that you do in front of your daughter?  No, well, I did it.  I did it because there was fucking 280 people there, you know, besides her.  A thousand feet at sea theater?  It doesn't matter.  I know, but I said sea...  There's always curtains.  Sometimes I have to curtain right behind the front row. 
[00:54:30]  What the fuck?  It still looks full.  It's a very exclusive club.  Is the curtain your best friend?  Yeah, it's me and the curtain.  It's funny.  No, that's just a warehouse behind the curtain.  Yeah, it's not part of the comedy club.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  Don't take me, Pete.  You ever go...  Last night, I was so fucking on last.  It was so great, the crowd.  Last night's a stress fight.  Like, there was some ONA people.  It was fucking just...  What were you doing on a fucking Thursday night? 
[00:55:00]  Oh, you're doing a Friday, Saturday.  Oh.  But I was there a couple weeks ago.  We came in to do a benefit for a cop that was shot in the line of duty.  So we came in late, Bonnie and I.  We just came in to do a benefit.  And it was really fucking hard because I didn't know.  And there was a whole table of people in the front row.  And I go to this one lady.  I go, you single.  Right?  Oh, no.  Yeah.  No.  Why would you do...  Oh, my God.  No.  Here we go. 
[00:55:30]  Was it the widow?  Yes.  And I didn't realize...  I didn't know.  No one told me.  This is a joke.  No, this is true.  Did they laugh like it?  It got real fucking kind of weird.  Wow.  That is like...  You're a hottie.  Are you single?  Whatever.  You know.  And it's just kind of like...  I don't know.  I mean, I was doing it for free.  Fuck.  Well, I mean, she was single.  I didn't know.  Oh, my God.  You're kidding.  Oh, that's so bad.  And I was on stage once, and this lady was sitting in the audience, and she's sitting  in the audience, and I go, she's holding the pillow on her breast, and she's with this 
[00:56:00]  real gay guy.  I mean, you couldn't get any gayer.  She's got a pillow on her chest.  I go, why are you holding a pillow?  She just had...  She goes, I had breast cancer, and I had my breast removed.  Right?  So I go, well, at least you're with a guy that doesn't give a fuck.  A gay guy.  A gay guy.  Holy shit.  Right?  You are brutal.  Well, how the fuck when a lady...  That's a funny line.  When you're on stage, and a lady says, I just had my breasts removed, how do you fucking  recover from that? 
[00:56:30]  I know.  How do you get your heart on down?  Hi, Kevin.  Hello.  Hi, Kevin.  Is your mic on?  Yeah, Kevin Smith has it for the studio.  You look fucking thin, man.  Oh, yeah.  I dropped some weight, man.  You dropped...  But even since last time we saw you?  A little more since then?  Yeah, man.  Right on.  Right on.  It's really good.  Do you want to sit here?  No, man.  No, please.  I came in late.  Do you guys know each other?  I came in late.  No, no, no, no.  Yeah, but you're Kevin Smith.  That's Rich Voss.  How are you, sir?  We met one time in studio.  Hi.  When we were talking about drug recovery.  Yeah, you know, at Muse?  When Muse is here?  Yeah.  It was over at the other place.  At the other place. 
[00:57:00]  Okay.  Hello, gentlemen.  How are you?  Very good.  Very exciting weekend for Kevin Smith.  Yes.  Red State.  Tomorrow night at Radio City Music Hall.  Who's coming?  Who's not coming?  I think I'm going.  Are you?  Yeah.  We got your tickets.  What time's the show?  8 o'clock.  See, what I'll do is I'll do my show at the Wellmont in New Jersey and then fucking shoot  over after.  Bang, bang.  Boom.  Nice plug.  Smooth.  Smooth.  Smooth.  Two-fer.  I want to pay for my tickets, though.  You said you got tickets.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I mean, I got you.  Nah, man.  You told us that you would need us to pay this time. 
[00:57:30]  I know, but we hit our minimum.  You did?  We're good.  Oh, yeah.  We hit it weeks and weeks ago.  Oh, that's nice.  So we're good.  Yeah, the place is more or less free.  We didn't, naturally, we didn't fill it 6,000 seats, but half full, 1,700 was our break-even  point.  And you're way above that.  And we got to like 3,000 or over 3,000.  So that was kind of neat.  It was nice for me as it beat the, my New York personal best at Carnegie Hall.  I'm sorry.  Black Bears spotted in Riverdale and other parts of New Jersey.  No, that was Patrice.  Oh, I thought the middle TV.  Yeah.  I was looking at the middle screen. 
[00:58:00]  Not the...  Boo's Smashing Rampage.  Yes, look at that.  Holy crap.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  A little riff-raff going on there.  And my wife said we should take the baby camping.  I'm not going fucking...  Look at how she's just taking it out.  Wow, she's just going down the aisle in a liquor store, just...  Was she meaning to do that, or was she actually looking for something?  No, she didn't.  There was a big...  What was her problem?  Does anyone know?  I don't know.  Come on, did you see?  Look at the picture of the black bear, man.  The black bear is just peeking around the corner.  Yeah.  They're walking, apparently, in the streets of New Jersey.  Yeah, there's a big problem, they say, the black bears. 
[00:58:30]  And they're supposed to be hibernating, but there's something going on where they're just walking  around and fucking with people.  They're dogs and shit like that.  Well, the end of the world is right around the corner, so they certainly...  Blame the thing?  Yeah, yeah, blame Mike.  Like they're out of sorts because of the hibernation scene?  Yeah, yeah.  That's throwing off the hibernation, and who about fuck knows?  Is that your actress?  Your actress.  Yeah, that is out there.  I thought it was Megan, but yeah, that's Carrie Bechet.  Hey, man, come on.  Bring him in.  Yeah, yeah.  Cool.  We can set up more microphones.  We got a busy day.  You know we're doing car crash comedy?  You going to help us out with that? 
[00:59:00]  Explain.  We got...  Wow.  Hi.  Hi.  Hey, everybody.  This is Carrie Bechet.  Hi.  She's in Red State.  Yes, she is.  And she's amazing in it.  Thanks, man.  Oh, yeah.  Is it possible to sit near Kevin or no?  Totally, absolutely.  Because it'll be easier, and it's easier.  I won't be able to see if she's behind me.  Yeah.  We'll be spinning around like a whirling dervish.  Explain.  What is it?  We got a ton of listeners.  They're already set up in the fishbowl.  We're going to, like, we're all moving to another studio. 
[00:59:30]  Guys trying out comedy.  And then we have the car crash sound effect.  And if you get three car crashes, you're out.  Get out of here.  And then the winner, I think, is going to do some time with Jimmy or down in Atlantic City.  You know, I was guessing the Wellmont Theater, if I liked their act, if they're really horrible  and they win, no.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Where's the Wellmont?  Is it by the Stress Factory?  It's in Montclair.  What's that?  Is it by the Stress Factory?  Oh, did you really?  Yeah.  I went to the Wellmont.  You've been to the Wellmont?  Yeah.  I did it once.  It was very nice.  Where do you live now?  Los Angeles. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, okay.  Where a lot of fucking actresses live, you fucking idiot.  Probably could have been New York.  A lot of waitresses.  She lives in Ringwood.  Ringwood, don't they have a black bear problem there?  That liquor store, the woman, she was set off because the clerk told her that she couldn't  use the bathroom after she caught a bunch of customers online and she got...  She was regretful of her actions?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And she says it's... 
[01:00:30]  What is it?  Quite out of her character.  Well...  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  So she had to pay for those bottles?  So she had to go to the hospital and give birth?  They have names for that on certain websites I go to.  So...  So...  Why don't we...  Who do you play in the movie?  I play Cheyenne.  She's like a daughter in the family.  She's a caretaker of the kids.  Oh, Kevin's...  So when you do a role like that, do you actually get into it?  Or like, meaning, do you start thinking of yourself like as the character off screen? 
[01:01:00]  How do you work?  Oh, that's not really how I roll exactly.  I think I try to relate to the parts of her that are like parts of me.  And she's, you know, I'm from New Jersey and not particularly religious.  And so it's great to have somebody that's really very different from you.  Because then you can learn a lot about yourself, about the things...  So she plays somebody who's really religious?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I would just say...  Her character's pretty out there, man.  She's like... 
[01:01:30]  Her character's interesting because unlike everyone else in the flick from that family,  the Cooper family, there are villains in the movie.  Unlike everyone else in the family who can immediately write off as villainous,  she has this moment where she kind of shows character or a degree of heart or something like that.  And it's kind of an interesting twist in the flick.  She's got kind of a moral decision to make between sort of the beliefs and tradition of her family  and, you know, sort of her personal values.  And so it's a really fascinating kind of thing to grapple with. 
[01:02:00]  So you're kind of like the Megan Roper Phelps.  Is that the one that everybody kind of wants to sleep with?  And we think that she might be turnaroundable.  The hot Phelps.  The hot Phelps if you can't have one.  She still has the awful Phelps hairline.  She reaches out to me on Twitter a lot.  And I call it flirting, it seems like.  I went back with her, too, back and forth with her, yeah.  I offered her...  I said my wife would say it was cool to do a three-way if it was to convert her.  So far, she's...  I think she's on a fence.  Yeah.  That's why I lost the weight. 
[01:02:30]  Is there a kind of a connection between the Phelps?  Is that type of family and the ones in Red State, is that kind of...  They were the leap-off point.  That's where I was...  Yeah.  After a while of...  After seeing the Phelps on...  And throughout media for, like, the last 10, 15 years, suddenly, they're everywhere.  Everybody knows them.  Like, I remember when I first started writing it, I was like, God, is anybody going to  know what I'm talking about outside people that know that group?  But, like, it was three years later, and these cats just did the Supreme Court case.  They just won.  They just won. 
[01:03:00]  They won the Supreme Court.  Yeah, but everyone...  I mean, that's a mixed bag.  It's like, you know, you kind of can't stand the fact they won, but at the same time,  it's like, thank God.  They had to win.  They had to win.  You kind of got to allow it.  Yeah, they had to.  I think afterwards, she was just like, in order to...  Disgusting, but...  In order for us to lose, they would have had to shred the, you know...  But, you know, this is why I hate the family so much, or have just a little respect for  them, probably with the Bill of Rights, right?  It was because they...  To me, there's a fraudulence there in that they say that they...  Oh, the war in Afghanistan and Iraq is just God paying them back for an IED thrown over 
[01:03:30]  into their yard.  But it's like, you have all this faith in God.  It's like, well, then, well, fucking...  Don't take the police protection, stupids.  Yeah.  Don't get ordinances.  How about you just...  If God is really looking out for you, and you're really carrying God's message, how  about you don't fucking tap dance for American ordinance?  At the end of the day...  And police protection.  How about you go in a fucking village and start yelling faggot at gay gangs?  There is a school of thought online that says that those cats don't really mean it.  Like, it is kind of like...  Some people have said it's a scam. 
[01:04:00]  Like, essentially, they go to a place...  It's the end game, though.  Kind of.  Well, the end game is loot.  At the end of the day, like, they'll go...  This is what I've read online.  I don't know if it's true, because I watched that dude talk, and he seems like a true believer.  I think they're very...  Believe it, yeah.  But some people maintain it's like a fantastic scam, where essentially they just go to a  place where they're picketing, and if you get up in their face and push them or something  like that, they can sue you.  Oh, God.  They can sue the property.  They can sue the people who's burying somebody.  Like, I don't know how true that is.  Like I said, I sat down and watched. 
[01:04:30]  Very litigious, I hear.  Very litigious.  Well, it's a whole family full of lawyers.  Yeah, yeah.  Have they won?  Have they won a lawsuit yet?  Were they...  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure they haven't.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They've won a lot of money, but they've also defended a lot of lawsuits.  They're not stupid people.  No, no.  Their lead counsel wins every case, I mean, because they know the law, they know the lines.  Yeah.  Kurt Phelps used to be a civil rights lawyer, right?  Yeah.  I think he was disbarred.  I don't know exactly what for him, but he was disbarred and...  Oh, he's just an awful man.  How is it that no one's taken shots at them?  Dude, I believe me.  What do you mean shots? 
[01:05:00]  Like, actually shot them at them.  Why, though?  At the end of the day, it's like they hold up horrible signs, but how is that?  But it gets people very angry, especially families of soldiers.  Like, they really...  Like, if you have a loved one that dies, and then you've got these people just rubbing  it in your face like that, you might have some people that would be kind of pissed enough  to pull out a gun and shoot them.  I've wondered why...  Not that you'd ever encourage it to happen, of course, but I've always wondered why it  hasn't.  I wouldn't care if I heard it. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, I wouldn't either, but I would never encourage it.  Well, they're attacking, right?  They're not the portion of society that would really take arms.  You know what I'm saying?  And a provocateur doesn't take it that far, you know what I'm saying?  Like, I mean, they maintain that they did not back down in regards to going to Arizona  to...  They were going to pick at the funeral of the little girl that got shot.  Right, yeah.  That's brave.  Yeah, that's great.  And then they maintain that it wasn't...  Somebody said in Arizona they'd quickly changed an ordinance law that couldn't allow them 
[01:06:00]  to get anywhere near it.  They maintain that they made a deal with some radio station where they were like, they gave  us free air, and we just agreed not to go to Arizona.  But it always felt like that was the moment that crossed the line.  And they'd gotten a lot of heat for that.  Oh, oh.  Like, you know, it's one thing when you go after dead gay folks, you go after dead soldiers  even.  But they went after a nine-year-old girl, and I think in one of the press releases or  one of the statements they made, somebody was like, you know, oh my God, she's an innocent.  And they were like, there are no innocents.  Yeah, yeah.  That's their whole gig, yeah. 
[01:06:30]  For this country, it seemed to push too far, even for the Phelpses.  And they seemed to kind of pull back.  I don't know.  That's my take on it.  Eventually, somebody will do what we all hope.  You can't say, but let's just say somebody will eventually do what we all hope.  We all hope somebody does.  And when that happens, then they're going to have to rethink their strategy.  Because, again, if they were going in places where they could be injured, I would have  a little more respect for them, even though they're repulsive.  Right.  But they remind me of kids yelling dirty words through the screen door.  Yeah.  You know, they're just, they're standing...  The adult religious equivalent of that. 
[01:07:00]  They're being protected by the police.  They're being protected.  Yeah, but anybody that's protest is being protected by the police.  But does it mean when the Klan protests or when the, you know...  Even the Klan, as repulsive as they are, wouldn't do that.  And the backlash against the Klan.  There's been a lot of physical backlash against the Klan.  Yeah, there's been a lot of violence against the Klan.  When the Klan shows up.  The Klan's been around for hundreds of years.  These cats have been around for what?  That's true.  That's true.  I guess, you know, it'll take time before they hit the wrong chord where somebody just  loses it.  See, Kevin's a very even-keeled guy, man. 
[01:07:30]  You're a very even-keeled.  You really don't have to process stuff.  At the end of the day, just kind of, you look at what they're doing, you're like,  well, that's kind of interesting.  They're taking the Constitution.  They're taking this country and using it against this country.  So on one level, you know, you go, oh, that's kind of fascinating.  They're trying to keep everyone on their toes.  But at the same time, I think they are morally convicted.  I think they believe what they say.  Oh, I think so, too.  At least he does.  I watched Malcolm.  I'd said it before.  Malcolm shot a documentary called Small Town Gay Bar, my friend Malcolm.  And he interviewed Phelps for like over an hour. 
[01:08:00]  And it was pretty fascinating and scary when you watch him talk.  You don't get any sense of con artist.  You get any sense of like, this is performance art.  You get the distinct impression.  He means everything he says.  I don't know about the kids, but definitely him.  Did Malcolm want to punch him in the face?  No.  And Malcolm, I was like, how'd you pass, dude?  Because Malcolm is gay.  But he also, he's kind of-  I know, he's a big guy.  He's not going to take anyone's shit.  But he said he was prepared.  If the dude ever asked him, like, you know, are you gay?  He would have been like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he's like, I wasn't hiding it, but I also wasn't cutting it out there. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Okay.  Wow.  Plus, he wanted to get the guy in-  The main thing is to get the guy in film because he's going to document it.  Would Phelps have talked to him if he knew he was gay, though?  Phelps might have.  They've argued with gays before.  I don't know if they would have let him in.  Because they let him right into the church, right into the compound.  Oh, boy.  Which I don't know if they would have if he was, like, you know, kind of more fae or if  he was just like, hello.  Crazy.  You know what gets them, too, is when you mentioned that Shirley has a kid out of wedlock. 
[01:09:00]  That, sorry.  Oh, does that kind of-  Yeah, Shirley had a kid out of wedlock.  And I forget which one it is, but when you go after her for that, that's to me what the  protest signs should all be.  That's the Achilles heel.  They should all be-  Because it's the one thing in their family that's a quote-unquote sin.  But it's such a blatant sin that you couldn't keep your legs closed.  Like, that's the one that people should be hitting them with.  Yeah, that would be a good one.  It's pictures of her with references to her legs being opened.  The people should-  You don't need to have messages of love.  Right.  You should attack where it would hurt.  We went up there with signs because they protested us at Sundance. 
[01:09:30]  I think I talked about this last time I was in.  And they had their protest signs, which were the usual suspects.  Man, just like, God hates this, God hates this.  And we went out with shit like, Thor hates straights.  And Malcolm said, dick tastes yummy.  And there were a full riot.  We had one for Megan that said, God hates Phelps, except Megan.  God thinks Megan's hot.  And she apparently liked that.  Everybody loves bacon.  Yeah.  You know what my philosophy on her is? 
[01:10:00]  And it's an absolute guess.  I suspect that she would not like men under any circumstances.  Oh, really?  Megan?  Yes.  My suspicion is that she is of the, I think she'd be very comfortable in a fucking San  Francisco type situation where she was allowed to, yeah.  Because she's like, she's a virgin.  I may never have, didn't she say she's a virgin?  And she may never, I saw an interview with her where she said that.  And she was like, I'm not going to ever have sex.  And I immediately, my first thought was, she's gay.  Really?  Yeah.  Again, it's purely a guess.  I went to school with like a lot of, you know, I went to Catholic school and I went to school 
[01:10:30]  with a lot of cats that, when we were, you know, from first to eighth grade, it's very  easy to be like, I'm going to be a virgin.  But there were cats that took it into high school as well.  And they weren't gay.  They were just kind of religious.  Now they're going to, I think she's religious.  She might be.  I think she's into dudes.  It was just, it was just a thought.  She didn't, she wouldn't say anything that made me think, oh, she's a virgin.  It was just a vibe because the way she said, I may never get married.  I may never.  She didn't say like, yeah, someday I'm going to get married.  See, I'm doing that.  Like, you know, the way a lot of religious people talk, that's always the fucking end  game is they're going to reproduce. 
[01:11:00]  And, you know, that's not what she said.  She just said, I may never make more lawyers.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, what's interesting, as much as we talk about the Phelps family, this movie is  really so much bigger than that.  There's, there's movements in it.  And, you know, it really expands the conversation to.  Really indict the media and, you know, the sensationalized aspects of the media that,  you know, that embrace these people and give them airtime.  And, and also the parts of the government that are, you know, sort of insidiously supporting. 
[01:11:30]  I don't know.  I don't know what movie you made, man.  I didn't see any of that.  This is a rom-com.  Yeah, what are you talking about?  Horror movie, horror movie.  That's the party line, kid.  Horror movie.  Horror movie.  But it's, just push horror movie.  I'm in love with you.  He's looking at Kevin, by the way.  I know.  Somebody can finally get him an acting role.  Their son, their son that won all the Olympic medals, should he break away from the family? 
[01:12:00]  Nothing.  The other Phelps?  I was there with you, dude.  Wow.  Nothing for them.  I was there.  It's okay.  Yeah, but you had no confidence.  So if we were in the fishbowl right now, would there be a car crash?  He had no confidence, because you turned your back, because you weren't sure Kevin was going  to enjoy that line.  No, I was doing it to you guys.  I wasn't doing it to Mr. Smith.  He was the only one that kind of got it, but you turned your back to him.  I didn't turn my back.  I'm trying to fucking work the whole crowd, okay?  I just spilled my guts with a girl.  I'm a married man.  I was the sight lines of rapport on that one. 
[01:12:30]  It was bad.  Yeah.  You were there, though, Kevin.  I was with him.  Hey, so what's going to happen tomorrow night at Radio City?  Tomorrow night, I'm looking forward to this.  It's like 8 o'clock, we come out and say hi to everybody, introduce the cast that's  coming out and whatnot.  You going to talk for a while yourself?  Chit-chat, just for a few seconds, just to let's get the movie started.  That's going to be tough for you, though.  That will be.  I'll talk afterwards.  Afterwards, I have all the time in the world.  There'll be so much more to talk about after that, after they see the flick.  So 8 o'clock, we share the flick, and then afterwards, it's only like 90 minutes. 
[01:13:00]  Afterwards, we do Q&A for like 90 minutes with the whole cast and crew that's there.  Cast and crew.  Well, cast.  Cast, me and the cast.  You can still get tickets if you want.  I want to talk to a grip.  Yeah.  I want to hear the grip's take on the movie.  How do they get tickets?  Just show up tomorrow night?  They can.  Yeah, I'm at the door.  You can go online now at coopersdell.com, or you can totally show up tomorrow at the  door.  Come on out.  It's going to be fun, man.  That's a great place to watch.  Radio City Music Hall is awesome.  I just saw it while we drove past on the way here, and I saw my name on the marquee.  How great is that?  That's pretty cool. 
[01:13:30]  That was neat.  And also, it was like, we're over my personal best year.  Like I said, Carnegie Hall is 2,600.  So we're over that.  So I feel kind of good about that.  That was neat for me to kind of go over that number.  Hell yeah.  Yeah, it was sweet.  You're part of a viral video.  I want to ask you about the Bill Maher thing.  Which one?  You were on it.  Oh, where a motherfucker was just like, oh.  I didn't understand.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A motherfucker was just like, ah, blah, blah, blah, in the background?  Yeah, I didn't understand what the guy was yelling, because you can't hear it on  the video.  We were talking about Muslim women versus American women, or how Muslim men treat Muslim 
[01:14:00]  women.  And the conversation had kind of settled, and you could tell that Bill was about to go  to something else.  And then a dude in the crowd just yells out, Bill, have you ever seen what a hellfire missile  does to a Muslim woman?  Ah, boy.  And everyone just kind of freezes, because it was like, that was weird.  And then all of a sudden, you hear him go, because we're all looking to find him, and  you just hear him go, don't touch me.  You're not allowed to touch me.  And then he's yelling out, and then I yelled out, shut up, Dad, because nobody else said 
[01:14:30]  anything.  I waited for Bill, because respectfully, I'm like, he's the host.  I bet you this motherfucker has a sheet of, like, fucking what to do when somebody screams  out.  But it was like, I waited one beat, two beat, too long, and then I was like, I'm going  to take it for one of these fucking politician types.  Right, right.  And went for the joke.  It was weird, though.  And then they took him out.  There was like six LAPD playing clothes, just descended on the dude, because they've  had truthers, is that what they're called?  Oh, those church bags.  Truthers, man. 
[01:15:00]  Jump out.  And I guess that's what this dude was, wasn't it?  Yeah, yeah.  Of course he was.  But I don't understand.  What is the Hellfire Missile part?  He's probably just saying that Americans kill more Muslim women.  He's just a fucking, probably a guilty suburban white guy.  But isn't the truth of the people about 9-1-1?  Yeah, they're like, the government was conspiring to bring the towers.  What they really are, though, is they're a bunch of suburban child adults who want to  continue yelling at mommy and daddy in the hallway.  That's what they are.  They ignore all evidence.  And now they're saying it was a plane who crashed. 
[01:15:30]  I just channel my shit into Twitter.  It's movies.  Yeah, exactly.  That guy sounds just like a left-wing guy who's...  They want to be part of something bigger than themselves.  They said that it happened once before they had one day where a truther popped up on  one side of the studio.  Truther.  Boom, a bunch of people descended on him, took him out.  Two minutes later, another one popped up.  And they had four in the crowd that kept going all night long.  So I guess he, at one point on a previous show, had went out into the crowd and kind  of threatened the dude.  Oh, Mar? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, he did.  I heard he's packing like a mule.  Yeah, he's a big dick.  I heard.  Well, I don't know about big...  Well, he didn't say he was going out there to fuck the dude.  He was going out there to fight the dude.  I heard he's like...  And he was...  But he works out.  He's pretty healthy and shit like that.  Yeah, but his audience is completely stacked with all liberals or left-wing.  I mean, any time...  Well, that's probably who just wants to go see him.  What's that?  That's probably just who wants to see him.  Any time on his show.  He's not going to spend time trying to figure out their affiliation.  Yeah, you don't fill out a political affiliation card.  Jimmy's right.  They're probably...  Yeah, I want to see Bill Maher over, I don't know, Bill O'Reilly. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  I don't know, but I...  Hey, Kevin, one more thing.  Fire.  Because of you, saw Catfish.  A lot of listeners saw Catfish because of you.  I know.  I've been seeing that on Twitter.  Yeah, yeah.  Now we need to discuss this for a minute.  Let's talk about it.  I love the movie.  Yes.  What's your take, though?  Do I think it's...  Well, first off, the first question is...  Spoilers for anyone who hasn't seen it yet.  Right, right.  If you haven't seen Catfish...  Bail right now for a minute.  Yeah, get out of the room for a little bit.  But we've given these people plenty of time to see it play. 
[01:17:00]  Exactly.  Fair enough.  That being said, the first question is, is the whole thing real or is it fake?  Right.  The second thing is, do you feel bad for the woman or are you like, this fucking psycho  bitch?  There are two schools of thought there.  I watch it with my wife and I was very empathetic for the woman where I was just like, look,  man, this is a victimless fucking crime.  These dudes getting up here in her face about it is just kind of gross.  Especially the moment you walk in there and see those two kids in the wheelchairs.  How can you fucking be like, let's keep shooting, man? 
[01:17:30]  I mean, on one level as a filmmaker, I knew who I, because they were like, this is fucking  gold.  Great shit.  If this is true, this is gold.  Yeah.  But if still, there's a part of the humanistic part of me would have, I could have, I had  to put, I would have put the camera down.  Once I saw those kids, I would have been like, forget it.  I would have kept shooting, but I felt horrible for the woman.  She obviously has got some mental issues.  My point is that some of the scenes were fake.  Which ones?  To pump up.  Oh, that's a very, well, there was one.  Like the one where her husband, who seems like, oh, I'm super poetic toward the end 
[01:18:00]  when he explains the catfish story.  That definitely was the first moment where I was like, hmm, that's a little too on point  for that dude to do.  Yeah.  When they hit the town in her house, I thought most of those scenes were completely real.  Except for when they went to the farmhouse in the middle of the night, it almost looked  like it was going to turn into a horror flick.  Yeah.  I thought that was set up.  But the scenes leading up to them confronting her, I thought they redid a few of those scenes 
[01:18:30]  to make a better movie.  And that's why some people...  Between the boys or not with her?  Yeah, that's why...  No, before they actually...  Like Mom mentioned, it already happened.  They recaptured between the brothers.  Like when they discovered that the song that she sent was...  Yes.  That seemed a little too...  Well, I mean, number one, they were cutting, so probably they took a lot of time out, but  it also did seem...  They seemed like they discovered that and then went, fuck, we weren't filming, so we got  to redo this.  I would agree.  I think they saw that with a lot of shit.  I think what they did was, this actually happened.  Then they decided, let's go up there and film some shit with this woman and see what this 
[01:19:00]  is all about.  Right.  They go up, they film it, and realize this is great stuff, but we don't have the build-up,  so let's manufacture, we'll recreate what happened to build up to this end thing that was real,  but I think the beginning, I think the whole beginning of the movie's manufactured.  Right, a lot of why.  I think it's a recreation right up until they...  Oh, with the boys in the apartment and stuff?  Yeah, I think that's all redone.  I totally buy that.  I think you're right about that.  The one scene, if it seems stagey, you kind of get your head around it, but the stuff with 
[01:19:30]  her...  With her, all real.  All real, real.  Do you think it's all real, though?  I think that's all real.  Yes, yes.  It's another ruse of the Jew.  I like the fucking graphics in that movie.  We're looking at it for the graphics, because we have to put graphics in our documentary,  and it had great graphics in the movie.  Could anybody argue right now if an angel fell out of the ceiling?  It had great...  It did.  For a low-budget flick, they really kept it moving along.  I'm telling you, we're sitting there watching the graphics.  We're going, we have to get...  But hold on, back to the lighting. 
[01:20:00]  We're watching a great movie for the graphics.  Yes, yes, because...  Yeah, we are, because...  When you're sitting here, we're making a fucking documentary, and we haven't put our graphics  in, and we're going, that's how we need it.  Pick up a motion program.  It's called Motion.  It's great.  It's carrying the fucking movie perfectly.  But the graphics in your movie make you taller?  Huh?  Nothing.  You have live text on your computer?  What's that?  Live text and motion and...  Are we really talking about graphics?  Yes, there's a lot of...  We got Kevin Smith in the studio.  Kevin knows graphics.  I'm on graphics, though.  I'm with him. 
[01:20:30]  You don't care about graphics, Kevin.  Second time.  Bad joke and the graphics thing.  Yeah, the graphics thing.  He's on Voss' team.  Team Voss.  Team Voss.  You know, but even though they kept filming, like the woman, even after they saw the kids,  I thought they were empathetic, though.  Like, they weren't...  They didn't humiliate...  They talked to her, because she had wasted a lot of their fucking time.  Well, did she?  A good amount of it, I think.  Did she?  And it was a weird ruse.  They got hooked in, too.  They could have bailed any time they wanted.  Oh, they could have, yeah.  But also, it's like any good con, right?  It's like everyone's getting something out of it. 
[01:21:00]  And the people...  Yeah.  The chick running the con, for her, she felt important.  I mean, to her, it wasn't a con.  She was just like, eh, it's just simple.  It's easy to keep going.  And it beats fucking reality.  Right.  Anytime she turned away from the computer, the view on the other side was just like...  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I felt bad for her.  So, immediately, she's back to the computer.  And in terms of the other guys, or the brothers and whatnot, they got a movie out of it.  And before that happened, they were just like, he felt cool.  He felt, oh, this chick likes my work.  And he was sending her pictures.  And they're young filmmakers, and all of a sudden, they got a subject. 
[01:21:30]  Right.  Wow, we got a first film.  Totally.  I mean, that worked out.  That, to me, was a victimless crime.  Getting back to what Ann said with the one scene where the guy has his toothbrush in his mouth,  like he was just about to go to bed, but they discovered something.  Yeah, that was manufactured to me.  Yeah, and the little arguments that they had between them seemed a little staged and stuff.  Like I said, I think the end was real.  They probably went through all that shit and then said, God, we've got to confront this woman.  Grab the camera.  Let's see what she's all about, and we'll put it on video. 
[01:22:00]  And then realized it's great, but we don't have the buildup.  Yeah.  We missed.  Oh, they probably said, God, I wish we were filming from the beginning.  Right.  We didn't know that this was going to happen, so then they said, let's just recreate the  whole beginning, and then the payoff will be real.  What about the reveal, though, when she goes, oh, yeah, when she's finally confronted?  When she's on the porch?  Why'd she say she had cancer, by the way?  No, when her daughter was.  She's a fat liar.  That was the other thing.  She's a fat liar.  I was like, I got in a fight with my wife about it.  She's like, she said she had cancer. 
[01:22:30]  That's the worst thing you could lie about.  And I'm like, oh, my God, these dudes show up on your porch after this harmless fiction  you've created with a camera in your face.  Like, I think you're justified to be like, you know what?  I have cancer.  Fuck you.  Oh, man.  That's how you think it kind of was the move.  Didn't work, because those dudes kept rolling.  But it didn't seem like she was bothered by the camera being there.  Like, she never seemed bothered by the camera.  She just seemed caught, man.  She knew the cameras were coming.  She seemed caught?  Do you think she did?  I don't think she knew they were coming. 
[01:23:00]  She was.  No, she didn't.  I think she was caught.  The movie is based on her signing a release and saying, yes, I'll do it.  So they're going to surprise her and take a chance.  By the end of it.  By the end of it, though.  Yes.  That's the thing.  It's like, there's no way they get her to sign it in advance.  And they would have blocked out her face anyway.  They could have still used her.  And by the way.  She didn't know they were making a movie when the camera was in her face.  Of course not.  They didn't get a release in advance.  She had no clue.  A lot of people think Banksy set the whole thing up.  But I'm not 100% sure.  I'm not sure if it was that or not, or if he was actually just filming the entire time.  Love that movie.  And then if the art gallery was just, was Banksy stuff or no. 
[01:23:30]  You watched Exit, right?  Through the gift shop.  Jugging me?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I love that fucking movie.  Yeah, that's great.  Shocking that it didn't win Best Documentary.  What did win?  I mean, not shocking, but the one that did, I'm not quite sure.  I forget what it was.  This year?  No, in 74.  Best Documentary.  74 was...  What's your quick take on Exit?  Mine?  Yeah.  I dug it.  I dug what it was.  I dug...  I think...  As to whether or not it's real or fake?  Yeah.  Does it matter?  I think that's the point of the whole flick, right?  You think Banksy was involved in the... 
[01:24:00]  It's just like, that's one...  Unlike Catfish, I do...  I would like to know if it's real or fake.  Right.  But Exit through the gift shop...  It works either way.  Yeah, it's just like...  It works on many levels.  That's kind of the point of it.  Yeah.  I loved it.  Are there any repercussions if a documentary turns out to be more manufactured than true?  Like, how do you know...  Michael Moore, a lot of his stuff, they find that he set up...  Like, there was a one...  You ever see...  I don't know.  What's the first one he did?  Roger May.  There's one scene where he's going in to get...  Is he in this country club?  And they're like, we can't say.  But it turns out, like, that wasn't even his country club.  Like, so he probably did that for a moment. 
[01:24:30]  Like, stuff like that comes out all the time.  It never seems to affect him.  But, like, with memoirs, you know?  Like, Million Little Pieces, there was all that...  Oh, James Fry, yeah, yeah.  He got tagged for that.  He got...  Oh, boy, yeah.  Fucking Oprah gave him a beating.  Oh, did she?  Oh, is that ugly?  He never came back from that.  He's written since, but...  What font are you going to use, Rich?  I know you want to...  What font are you going to use?  Font.  Let's just get it out there.  What font did you decide on so we can move on?  Yeah, exactly.  You go with a song? 
[01:25:00]  Times New Roman?  Which one are you using?  Like, when we were in studio with you guys, that was all real.  And you guys came out great.  As a matter of fact, I have it on CD right here.  You guys.  Oh.  How you guys helped carry our movie.  We're going to be in a film there.  Kevin, finally.  We're in a documentary.  We're in a documentary.  Right on, man.  Yes.  Women aren't funny.  We're making...  That's what it's called?  Yeah.  We're going to alienate half the audience.  No, it isn't because it's not...  It's not about that.  Who gives a shit?  Right, right, right.  Why is it even brought up?  Yeah, yeah.  And it's not an empowered documentary.  It's a comedy about our woman funny. 
[01:25:30]  Right.  All right?  And my wife...  I'm telling you, my wife is so fucking brilliant at putting it all...  Bonnie is brilliant.  I don't know how...  But look at the comparison.  Good point.  Yeah.  I talked to you on the phone about it when you called into that.  She can't be too brilliant.  She said, I do.  Exactly.  You know, the whole...  And I'm thinking about what you're doing.  I'm going, I'm just going to take it to every gig.  What is Rich doing?  I don't...  What is he doing?  I'm just pontificating.  You're just unravelling.  What are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  Just two filmmakers.  Two filmmakers.  What are you talking about?  Hey, listen. 
[01:26:00]  Look, I've been doing stand-up 28 years.  Okay, I'm done with that.  I'm into filmmaking now.  Are you begging right now?  What's that?  Are you begging?  Kevin's not going to help you distribute.  No.  Maybe you could show your movie before his tomorrow night.  Kevin's getting out of the business.  No, it's not done.  It isn't done.  We still have to do sound.  We have to get our composer.  And the graphics.  Yeah, exactly.  Show the movie before his.  You're used to opening.  Maybe you could use it on fucking iMovie and have like your burgundy curtains open up.  The one YouTube video I ever made.  I put burgundy curtains like a fucking shithead.  Like, that's cinematic, isn't it? 
[01:26:30]  Zilch.  That's a stir.  All right, I've done that once, too.  Hey, iMovie doesn't give you a lot of choices.  No, they don't.  Burgundy curtains or something else.  I'm going to get another program.  How many movies have you done?  Have you been in a lot of movies?  Yeah, I've done a handful.  You played a daughter in...  In any movie she's been in, she technically was a daughter.  Nah, she was in a fucking big movie.  I'm trying to...  Keep going, because I'm sure he's wrong.  Yeah.  Whatever.  I was in the first two seconds of Sex and the City, the first movie. 
[01:27:00]  Those guys saw that.  I didn't see that.  Did we, Rich?  I don't think I saw that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Kevin, what do you think of the Oscars?  You've got a filmmaker in studio, Rich.  I watched.  I'm sorry.  I was reading the tweets.  It was...  Yeah, I was live tweeting the whole time.  Yeah, yeah.  That is the thing to do now with any of these, because I was following...  You follow a few people that you think are entertaining and stuff.  I was following you.  Norm MacDonald had me laughing my balls off. 
[01:27:30]  He had a good night.  It's just...  Because you read his tweets in the Norm voice.  Yeah.  It's like, hey, what about that computer?  Why don't they thank the computer?  And you're just like, fuck, a guy is brilliant.  Brilliantly retarded.  Yeah.  And who else was I following that night?  Did you watch or did you follow?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was watching.  There were a lot of people.  I was tweeting like a maniac.  I was like, I didn't even watch.  I just looked at your tweets and someone else's.  It was like, they always said who won, so that was...  Like, it's turned into this thing where everybody can play mystery science theater with celebrities. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  And, you know, you're just all pitching in your opinions on whatever you're watching.  It was a little slow, wasn't it?  Did you find it kind of boring as all?  If it wasn't for Twitter, I would have turned that thing off.  By grabbing those hosts, they seemed to want a youth audience.  They were horrible, right?  But then they just did the same old fucking old show with a younger set of hosts.  That's it.  I thought Sandra Bullock was great.  I thought she, her fucking, when she came out to give the Best Actor award, she was great. 
[01:28:30]  Her timing, she was funnier in that little segment than the whole night, in my opinion.  I thought she was great.  I thought Russell Brand was funny.  He made me laugh with Helen Mirren.  The Arthur trailer was not...  Like, I saw the Arthur trailer, and I'm like, it was actually not bad, the trailer for it.  Really?  I just bummed the remake.  The trailer was actually not bad.  I'm not a fan of commies that are remade.  I love the original Arthur, but to be fair, it's a concept that easily can be redone and updated. 
[01:29:00]  And if you're going to do it with anybody, he's the guy.  We're talking more Pink Panther.  Oh, yeah.  Why would you do that?  Well, Steve Martin really did capture something, because he was almost too brilliant when Sellers  did it.  And it was when he was, that hamburger, that 45-minute hunk where he was going, hamburger.  I was like, ah, another couple minutes.  Come on.  It's good.  That was actually funny, though.  I remember watching that on a plane, man.  I didn't see that flick, and at one point it was playing, and that scene ran.  The hamburger, and when he starts to cry, man, that made me laugh. 
[01:29:30]  My bad.  But it didn't make me laugh.  My bad.  My bad.  Fair enough.  I would regret it, too.  You just remember Peter Sellers being so brilliant in the Pink Panther movies.  It's tough to see anyone doing that role, man.  To me, there's a certain thievery in that.  Like, remaking a movie like Spider-Man is one thing, because it's graphics.  But it's like, if you went on stage wearing an arrow through your head, people would be  like, yeah, he's stealing Steve Martin's shit.  And they'd be right to say that.  To me, it's just a fucking rip-off.  It's like, have respect for Sellers.  He's dead.  What are you going to do?  Fucking being there next?  They did a fucking odd couple with two black actors. 
[01:30:00]  Not the Honeymooners.  I know.  Also, it's one of the few films I refused to audition for.  Which one?  The Honeymooners?  Yes.  I didn't think I would have.  If it was offer only, I would have taken it.  I was too embarrassed that I probably wouldn't have got it.  Because dancing White Guy 3, I would have flopped.  Well, listen, we've got to take a break, because we've got to move over to the other  joint.  All right, we're going over to the other studio.  Yeah.  I have to blow at a certain point to go to our mutual friend, Imus.  No, Imus. 
[01:30:30]  Imus of the morning.  I sat in with Imus last time I was out here, and I guess that was the first time, A, he's  ever heard of me, and B, he didn't know that I could speak.  Wow.  That was nice.  I mean, that's a name that you grew up with.  Yeah, but he didn't know, he didn't know of you?  I know.  I don't think so.  Come on, he's had to have.  Maybe, maybe.  I don't know.  I hit the chair, he didn't seem to, there was no recognition.  He's weird that way, though.  But he was very gracious and very cool and very like, you can talk, you can talk, you  can come back every time you're home.  Oh, good.  Good for you. 
[01:31:00]  Thanks, man.  We've got the Radio City Music Hall Red State thing.  Come tomorrow night, Radio City Music Hall tomorrow night, 8 o'clock, Red State, and  then the Q&A afterwards with me and the cast and whatnot, Carrie Bechet here, she'll be  there.  Yeah, right on.  Who else?  A lot of cats are going to be there.  I think Melissa Leo's coming in, too.  I said, bring your Oscar.  She just won an Oscar for The Fighter.  Yeah.  Oh, she's in it?  Yeah, yeah.  She's in it.  Oh, the mother, right?  Oh, she was great.  She plays Carrie's mom in the flick.  Oh, okay.  I can't believe how good-looking she is when she cleans up.  Yeah, she's really young at the Oscars, man. 
[01:31:30]  Really young?  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That makeup did wonders because she looked kind of haggie in the fight.  Well, I just think if you look at her in the movies, generally, that's where they put  the makeup on.  She wasn't a good manager, though.  Terrible.  The guy who missed the point.  She's in Red State.  That's cool.  Yeah, that's going to help the movie.  Yeah, Amy Ryan was great.  Yeah, that'll help our movie?  I believe you're right.  I think so, yeah.  That's got to be great when you do something with somebody and then they win an Oscar.  That was nice.  And then suddenly it legitimizes our flick even a bit more.  It's great, man.  But it'll be very helpful. 
[01:32:00]  Not so much right now for the immediate for the tour, but when we come out in October,  that'll be insanely helpful.  Oh, you guys are coming out with a regular release.  Regular release.  Yeah, that's when we're going.  I mean, we're just self-releasing, but it doesn't mean we won't come out.  This is just kind of a word-of-mouth tour.  Yeah, Kevin explained.  He got the movie done quickly, so he's got all this time to kill.  So he said, what the hell?  Let's try something different.  And then I'm starting.  Can I talk about the radio thing before we leave?  Yeah.  I'm starting Smodcast Internet Radio.  I'm going to go mornings.  I'm going to go 11 o'clock your time.  I waited until you guys were on. 
[01:32:30]  I go 8 o'clock out there, but then 11 o'clock out here.  And I'm going to do four hours live every day at Smodcast.com.  Starting May 9th, we'll do, it's called Smornings with Kevin Jen.  That's from 8 to 10.  That's me and the wife.  I've been doing a show with her called Plus One, and she's really sharp, and she's a good cursor.  And then after that, I do a show with Muse called Jay and Silent Bob Get Jobs.  Oh, Get Jobs?  Yeah, that's just sitting around.  I like that Jay and Silent Bob get old.  Yes, that was the podcast.  That was fucking funny, man. 
[01:33:00]  I was watching some of those and really good stuff.  It was fun.  But yeah, I'm transitioning over, dude.  I'm going to talk, man.  If you need a celebrity guest when I'm out there, I'll be happy to swing by at this time.  Ladies and gentlemen, from The Tonight Show, James Norton.  How is that?  You've been on quite a bit, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He puts me on a lot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Every once in a while, I'm clicking through, and holy shit, Norton again, man.  Yeah, yeah.  They give me a lot of segments, which is great.  You know Bobby, Dane Cook's opener?  Do you know Bobby Kelly?  Oh, you have to make fun of Bobby.  Hi, buddy.  I saw you on HBO the other day. 
[01:33:30]  Bill Maher.  God, everybody watches that.  Well, it was funny, because you did like a bunch of dick jokes.  Yeah, that's all I could do.  That's an intimidating room, man.  Everyone's very smart and righteous about something, and I'm not smart or righteous about anything,  so I just went for it.  That was some good dick jokes.  I went for the dick.  Yeah.  I did get three.  The one I was proudest of was the cock crow joke.  I like when I cross my dick jokes in my car. 
[01:34:00]  All right, we really got to take a break, because we got to move over to you.  Yes, we do.  Kevin, right on, man.  We'll see you tomorrow night, Radio City Music Hall.  Eight o'clock.  See you guys there.  Car Crash Comedy next.  Stay there.  After five years, I'm telling you, just little things.  You know when a relationship is going fucking, like when my wife eats an apple, it's really  loud, and it fucking drives me nuts.  She's so fucking loud.  Does she put it in the palm of her hand and try to feed it to you?  Why did you pick an apple? 
[01:34:30]  You stepped a line by Casino.  Why are you picking an apple?  Actually, his caps are great now.  I don't have to eat.  They're not caps or implants.  Whatever they are, they look fantastic now.  They really don't.  But I had to go old school to go.  I know.  So her eating an apple drives me nuts.  That annoys you?  It's just little things.  It's loud.  Loud apple eating should not really annoy somebody.  That's trouble.  If you're watching TV.  No, no.  We're getting along great.  But just little things. 
[01:35:00]  Like she hates.  Like breathing?  She hates when I pick my toenails.  Oh, that is disgusting.  Not when you get a big one.  Oh, no.  Stop.  What are you doing?  Stop it.  You don't do that.  What do you mean pick?  You know, like, because after you take your socks off, if you wear them like for a day  or two and somehow your toenails are real soft, you know, from your boot.  Because I don't know the sweater or whatever in your boot or foot.  I would think it would probably soak in and make your...  And you can pee.  It's almost like you can get some really good ones. 
[01:35:30]  Wait, did you say the sweater in your boot?  The sweat in your boot.  Wait, wait.  Good strips of nail itself?  Or are you picking shit underneath here?  No, the toenail.  I've picked toenails where I've taken the whole toenail off.  You're a fucking...  You're a brundle fly.  Wait, don't you have a toe that doesn't move?  Yeah.  He has a toe that's dead, remember?  It doesn't move.  Oh, right.  Yeah, he's got a dead toe.  It's in our movie.  I try to explain it to people.  The dead toe?  But it just died. 
[01:36:00]  Now, I will pit a loud apple eating against toe picking any day of the week, and I'll take  the loud apple.  That is disgusting.  Yeah, really.  You have nothing to complain about.  Yeah, but see, you can turn your head and not see the toe picking.  No, but you know it's there.  Right.  You know it's going on behind you.  And like a car wreck, you gotta look.  Like, Vaughn's picking his toenail.  What are you picking?  Do you go, oh, look.  Do you?  Oh, and you pitch it better apple eating.  Sometimes I'll get a bunch of them and put them on the table and build up a pile. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, yeah, that's just as bad.  Oh, God.  I don't build up a pile.  You don't use a nail clip, like it's a shower, and then they get soft, kind of in the shower,  whatever, and then you just clip them in the bathroom.  What am I, three years old?  You don't clip your toenails.  You fucking rip them off.  Yes, you do.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Your toenails, you fucking, you pick them, and then you get big ones, and you play with  it a little or whatever.  You don't even have jagged fucking saw blade edges on them. 
[01:37:00]  Body's legs must be just chopped apart from your toenails in bed.  Plus, if you rip it off too far down, man, that hurts.  Oh, no, I know.  Sometimes you'll draw blood.  You gotta be careful.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I gotta grab my foot.  I gotta grab my foot just sent me to the pain.  Calm down.  And you're like, didn't you used to bite him in the bathhouse?  I'm imagining it.  It's horrible.  Dude, what the fuck?  Didn't you used to bite him in the bathhouse?  That's the worst feeling when you cut him down too far.  Yeah, but he used to bite his nails, too.  He has a thing with nails.  I used to be a biter, but I'm done with that.  Yeah, I'm trying.  Yeah, I don't do that as much. 
[01:37:30]  I don't bite the nails anymore.  I don't bite them.  Once in a while, they'll get big.  But it's just some kind of feeling you get.  I don't know when you just fucking.  I know I've yanked it, and then the blood comes out.  I've yanked it, and the blood comes out.  That's great.  And it hurts, and then for the next two days, when you put your fucking shoe on, you can't  bump it.  Oh, my God.  I have, like, I'm freaking out at the sound of this.  Yeah, absolutely.  Why do you do that?  Huh?  Why do you do that?  Because his mom sucked.  Figure it out.  Because he can't do drugs or booze, so he's got to get some pain or something somewhere. 
[01:38:00]  What did your mom do that was so awful?  She wasn't right here.  She didn't say to me.  No.  She didn't.  No.  She was just.  She was a good mom.  She was a struggling mom with three kids, you know, on her own.  What the fuck?  Did she berate you a lot?  No.  No.  Well, I don't know.  Rich, we all love you very much, but if you continue this toenail pulling, we will not  allow you back in this house.  Toenail intervention.  She didn't get it.  I even had a prop.  It was good.  Oh, God.  Sometimes you really killed them. 
[01:38:30]  That hack bit fucking intervention.  Oh, that sucked.  That was all right.  I tried.  I can only throw them out so much.  That was not a bad one.  I just didn't have anything to add to it.  I wish I did.  I don't know.  You know.  I can't get over.  I can't get over how good looking.  What?  Rich Voss is?  No.  She is.  Oh, oh, yeah.  It's really.  It's pointing at Sam.  I go to Snopes and people forward me crap.  You get that forwarded stuff, and it's like, did you hear that this person said this? 
[01:39:00]  And then you go to Snopes, you pop the name, and it goes, no, it's bullshit.  And then you send it back.  CC'd with everyone that the forward was forwarded to.  Right.  So you make whoever sent the original thing look like an ass.  How do you know Snopes is real?  Yeah, for real.  Because they kind of do tell you where they got the information from.  Yeah.  Like where the myth came from in the first place.  A lot of the myths are like kind of shoot-offs from old myths that used to spread by Xerox around the office. 
[01:39:30]  And they go back, and they'll actually find the source of it a lot of times.  It could be 1800s or whatever.  Yes.  They do, actually.  I know.  And the founder, Ted Snopes, just felt that there was too many rumors circulating.  He didn't like it.  Of course.  He wouldn't like that. 
[01:40:00]  No.  But he dispels a lot of rumor, Ted Snopes.  Yes.  But he also confirms things that people might think are.  Yeah, yeah.  That, too.  Yeah.  He's good at that, Ted.  Yes.  Do you know what my favorite myth to dispel was?  What's that, Ted?  That the abominable snowman was a Seattle Seahawks fan.  It was a pack of lies.  How did you dispel that?  I was near his lair, and I saw a Charger's hat. 
[01:40:30]  Well, that would dispel.  Snopes!  Is that your last name?  It's my nickname.  Oh, Ted Snopes.  Yes.  Because you said what your last name was once before.  Yes, but I don't remember.  I didn't either.  I was hoping you would. 
[01:41:00]  I'm forgetful.  I'm just trying to see if somebody does have it.  I'm sure someone does.  Yeah, idiots remember everything.  Except that, maybe.  You know what it was?  I would say nopes a lot when I was a kid.  Like, they would say, hey, you want to go out?  Nopes.  And they would go, good.  Ted's nopes again.  And I just kind of stayed. 
[01:41:30]  Ted is a douche.  Ted is a goddamn fool.  My name is Ted Sheckler.  Is it Sheckler?  It certainly is.  I don't think it was Sheckler.  Well, you think what you want.  I'll dispel it.  No one's got it.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Also, do we have an update on Howie Mandel, people are asking? 
[01:42:00]  Our friend Howie was rushed to the hospital, what, yesterday?  Or earlier this morning?  Probably yesterday.  Up there in Toronto.  And has an irregular heartbeat.  False!  Oh, Ted Snopes.  That's another falsehood.  He wants to 7-Eleven to buy a hat.  Fucking germaphobe.  Ted Snopes would know. 
[01:42:30]  Yes, he would.  He's like the drudge of celeb rumors.  And mystique.  Mystique.  You know, why didn't I put a little, you know, Jewish star on my back?  What do you think of Hillary and Obama?  What do you think?  Hi, folks.  Primetime Sam Roberts here for the Opie and Anthony Internship Program.  You know, I wasn't always a world-famous celebrity.  I started as a simple Opie and Anthony intern.  Here's your banana, Sam.  Thanks, Matt.  You know, when I first started, what is this? 
[01:43:00]  Is this a goddamn bruise?  Uh...  Get your worthless ass back down there and get me a real piece of fruit.  And use your own goddamn money.  Being an Opie and Anthony intern is an exciting thing.  You'll get to learn new equipment, see a real radio show being produced,  and have one-on-one guidance every step.  Hey, Sam, I have an idea.  Do you see that red light on?  When that fucking light is on, it means I am creating.  Understand that you will never amount to anything of substance. 
[01:43:30]  Now get the fuck out of my face.  So apply now to be an Opie and Anthony intern.  Go to SiriusXM.com slash internships to apply.  Because remember, we all have to start somewhere.  Hey, Sam.  Don't look at me in the eyes, maggot.  It's even doors.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's something real.  I wish we were on the air.  It's all good stuff.  Part of radio.  What the fuck? 
[01:44:00]  How long does it take?  Now what do we do, Sam?  Like you just gotta pull the plug.  Yeah, Sam, do something.  Sam, what do we do?  Keep the crowd warmed up for us.  You guys are already here.  I can bring up CNN.com.  We can talk about what's...  That's it.  Here's some more talk.  The virus.  SiriusXM.  And now, live from the SiriusXM studios in New York City.  New York City.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show's car crash comedy.  Car crash comedy.  Five amateur comedians competing for fabulous prizes and national acclaim. 
[01:44:30]  And now, your hosts, Opie and Anthony.  All right, we're going to try this again.  Are we live from the fishbowl?  I hope so.  We just did 15 amazing minutes of radio that no one heard, Anthony.  No one heard it.  Because for some reason, the studio didn't work.  Yeah.  Are we getting a thumbs up, thumbs down?  Thumbs up, thumbs down.  Are we live after a 30-minute break?  I refuse to talk unless we're broadcasting.  We're on.  How is your fucking iPad five minutes off from my iPhone? 
[01:45:00]  What are you talking about?  Your clock says 8.25 a.m.  Mine says 8.20 a.m.  A lot of time.  How does it happen?  I'm 8.20 over here.  No, I got...  Our phones are the same time.  My iPad.  Oh.  This is a...  I don't know.  Whatever.  Hey, we got car crash comedy.  Of course, Jim Norton, Rich Voss, and Bob Kelly are going to be judging this damn thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And these guys aren't the... 
[01:45:30]  This is just the audience.  Yeah, it's just the audience.  We have some live audience.  Are the comments out there?  Luther here from 48 Hours.  Luther.  That's a great reference.  30 years later.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Yes.  You don't do any old references?  Not that old.  Oh, okay.  So I got to stop at 26 years?  Hey, mom's a main boy.  All right.  Don't laugh at him because he's him.  That stunk.  All right?  Fuck you.  Oh, it's Jim.  We got to laugh.  Fuck you.  He's a nobody with no chin.  Fuck that jellyfish.  Okay?  Stress Factory this weekend or Arlington. 
[01:46:00]  Plenty of tickets available.  Dude, you don't see me plugging Uncle Vinny's tonight in Point Pleasant.  No.  Or fucking Staten Island tomorrow night.  Why don't you settle down with the plugs?  Of course not.  Okay.  Well, listen.  Because next week at the Arlington Cinema Draft House right outside D.C.  Oh, the Draft House again.  The Draft House.  The Draft House.  We were so happy this didn't make the radio the first time.  I know.  Now it's got to make the radio, right?  Here it is.  His Draft House.  Our luck.  Yeah. 
[01:46:30]  What about the Draft House there, boss?  No.  Next weekend outside.  What are the voices telling you to do?  Oh, one of our.  You made fun of me on Facebook.  I'm sorry.  Really?  Oh, shit.  And I was the first.  Anyhow.  Wait, wait.  Yeah, you were.  You called me a mongoloid.  I'm sorry.  You called him a mongoloid?  Did I spell it right?  I'm glad you just proved him wrong.  I know.  I don't think he was kidding.  I don't think he was trying to be funny.  Because my brother tagged you in the photo as Midget Finger Jew. 
[01:47:00]  Okay.  Yeah, you blame me for that.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't do any investigating on who did it.  I'm sorry.  I didn't have time to get.  No, it's still in the family.  This is the mindset of every fuck bod fan that is on the internet.  You did that to me.  It's like, great.  I get 808 fucking texts and tweets and everything else a day.  Give Lloyd a chance to explain exactly what happened.  Don't.  Sorry. 
[01:47:30]  I don't care.  I don't care.  It's funny.  You care enough to bring it up.  Did it hurt your feelings a little bit?  I was going to be on the radio.  You're lucky we took the pledge yesterday.  I'm not getting it.  I'm not getting it.  He's very angry.  I'm missing it.  Yeah, he's right up front.  You're missing it?  That's me.  What are you missing?  What, love?  Yes.  The chromosome bus?  What's the matter?  You sound angry today.  Yeah, you're like pissed off.  Why are you tired, sweetie?  You'd be mad too if your tongue didn't fit in your mouth.  Oh, shit. 
[01:48:00]  Go, Bob Kelly goes right for the fucking jugular.  Keep him coming.  You're a good guy.  I know.  Thank you.  Wow.  You're a nice guy.  You all right?  Everything's good.  All right.  Yeah.  Love you, Jimmy.  Thank you so much.  Let's make fun of the good-looking twink in the back.  Which one?  Why go for the easy target?  Yeah.  This fucking serial rapist in the back.  Yeah.  Hey, preppy killer.  Who's Seacrest?  Seacrest?  Unpop your collar, faggot.  And wake the guy up next to you. 
[01:48:30]  He is awake.  He's awake?  Oh, he is?  Yes.  He's just being alternative.  Got to look high all the time, man.  That's what we do.  We're not here.  Fuck this.  I'm going to listen to David Cross.  Abu.  See you, Richard.  That's the brakes right on it.  There was no confidence.  Where's the car crash?  Let's test out the car crash.  Why would that work?  Louder.  There it is.  Can they hear it?  We're going to need that.  You can hear that? 
[01:49:00]  There's no response team.  Should we get started or what?  We got some opening acts.  I didn't hear what you said.  Opening acts.  I heard you.  I didn't say it again.  That's what this fucking car got me with.  Let's get this started.  What the hell?  We got some opening acts before we get to the real contest.  We do.  Yeah, guys to just kind of warm up the crowd.  Warm up the crowd.  Get them going.  Yeah.  What's the prize?  Do you know?  We didn't even talk about this all week.  I don't even know what's going on.  Yeah.  Two grand and you get to eat on Bobby.  Oh. 
[01:49:30]  I think it is like an undetermined cash prize.  I'm not sure how much.  Okay.  What is it?  Let me see.  And the Car Crash Comedy is brought to you by the Borgata Hotel Casino Spa.  Visit Borgata.com.  They also get a chance to, I guess, go up on stage at the Borgata, huh?  That's nice.  And get completely fucking humiliated.  You can't even get that gig, Rich?  No.  You can leave and join the comics if you want to try to win this.  I got to fucking do contests now to get back into Borgata.  Stay hard to stay on a Sunday.  Oh.  You can leave and join the comics if you want to try to win this. 
[01:50:00]  I got to fucking do contests now to get back into Borgata.  Stay hard to stay on a Sunday.  Oh, whatever.  Was there a big crowd?  Yeah.  It was fucking sold out up to the third row.  Curtain's a bigger crowd.  I thought I hit bonus here.  What are you talking about?  Another curtain situation?  No.  It was during last comic we did the Borgata.  All right, listen.  Let's get this going.  No one cares.  Yes.  No one cares.  I know.  He asked.  Rob Ivins?  Is that his name?  Where is he?  Where is he?  Let's bring him on. 
[01:50:30]  All right.  Rob Ivins is parading the comics out, led by Club Soda Kenny, is parading.  Look at this.  It looks like a perp walk.  Look at this.  Holy shit.  Yes.  Exactly.  Is that it?  They have to check.  Who raped him?  Let's check for semen in the stroller.  And the last guy, he's security too, the little guy?  Yeah.  That's Joe.  In fucking Oz.  I like that he had to help you with the joke.  You know what?  He was a Bronx cop.  He'll fucking throw you through the wall.  He'll mess it.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he will.  He'll be a small wall, but he'll throw you through it. 
[01:51:00]  He'll be more like a curb, but he'll throw you right through it.  He'll throw you into the fucking mouse hole.  All right, good.  All right.  How is this going to work?  These guys got two minutes, right?  And if they get three car crashes, they're done.  They don't make it to two minutes.  Jesus.  And these are kind of the first.  The warm-up guys, right?  Yeah, the warm-up guys.  Are they in the contest?  Huh?  Are the warm-up guys in the contest?  Well, they get air time, and who knows what happens.  We got actually four guys that are worth competing.  Technically, these guys are here so we can make fun of them a little bit. 
[01:51:30]  These guys don't even.  Exactly.  You want to know the truth.  That's my fucking job.  They don't even look happy.  They look miserable.  They're all miserable.  Did you make them do this?  So they really are comics.  Hey, are you the only one doing the actual car crashes?  I'm going to have to get a cue from these guys.  Yeah, okay.  If you give me a thumbs down, I'll contract the money.  There's your cue.  After he tells the joke, just hit the button.  When he's introduced.  Right when he walks in the door. 
[01:52:00]  Rich, introduce the first guy.  Over here, I got the names.  Rich.  On the left side.  On the left side?  Okay.  Our first act, you might recognize me if you were looking out the window a second ago.  A big hand for Rob Ivins.  Rob Ivins.  Rob Ivins.  There we go.  Oh, look at this.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, my gosh.  Bring him on, music.  All right.  Let's just go?  Yeah.  Okay.  Anyway, I recently quit my job as a kindergarten teacher to pursue comedy full time. 
[01:52:30]  I call it a job, but it's really, as you can imagine, being a kindergarten teacher, it's  more play time than work time.  The kids are cute and everything.  And, you know, but I think the best part about being a kindergarten teacher is the fact that  my student's tiny hands make my dick look so much bigger than it really is.  Where are we going?  So, I don't think abortion would be such a big deal in America if women actually laid 
[01:53:00]  eggs like chickens.  Because, really, who doesn't like to sit down to a nice big omelet every now and again?  There's one car crash.  Okay.  Hey, you've got to cut him a break.  He's going first.  Anyway.  Do you have anything stronger than a car crash?  Yes.  A fucking plane crash?  A plane?  Something?  Like a nuclear bomb?  Mid-air collision between two 747s?  Let him finish.  Don't car crash him.  Go ahead, Harry Chapin.  That's fine.  But anyway.  I wish you'd have the same end result. 
[01:53:30]  I lost his head, see?  I turned 30 last week and, you know, things are changing.  I realized I'm kind of disconnected from younger people.  Like, I see a guy on the street.  I don't know if he's gay or just really, really cool.  What?  That was his best line.  That was a good line.  Sounds thirsty.  So, anyway.  It didn't get all that.  I remember when I was younger, people used to tell me how, like, well, you're going to start  losing your hair.  And the less hair you have on your head, the more you get in other parts of your body.  And it's true.  Because growing up, I didn't really have chest hair. 
[01:54:00]  But now I do.  But it's not cool.  Like, Hugh Jackman chest hair.  It's, like, patchy.  Like, my chest just looks like a map of Indonesia.  My left nipples, East Timor.  With a smaller island under it.  Geography jokes.  How many crashes am I at?  One, two, two.  Oh, you should have went fucking your camera.  You shouldn't acknowledge the crashes.  The fucking mood of the room.  You're at two legitimate ones and around 19 in my head.  This is my third microphone switch.  I got to give you another mic, you're so hot.  Okay, so, yeah. 
[01:54:30]  Anyway, I used to, when I was younger, when I first started comedy,  I used to make a lot of jokes about rape.  But now that I'm older, I realize that rape is no laughing matter.  Like, literally, I've never seen a woman laugh while being raped.  Unless you're a kindergarten kid.  Was that after the bell?  After the bell.  He actually made it.  Oh, damn.  He made it.  And Voss punched his joke up at the end.  Hold on, hold on.  What's his name?  What's his name?  Rob Idens.  History.  And you want to, for being here, you want to promote anything?  Rob Idens, who I thought did pretty well for coming out in the beginning. 
[01:55:00]  Yes.  Yeah, exactly.  What do you want to promote, sir?  Thank you.  You know.  Promote anything?  Your Twitter?  Your Facebook?  What do you want to promote?  Yeah, you can just, like, YouTube, Rob Idens.  You can just find me on there.  All right, there you go.  The omelet joke is very close to something Carlin did.  I'm not saying you took it from him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, it's a conclusion, a lot of people.  And the little hands on the dick, wow.  I've heard that as many times as I've had those little hands around my dick. 
[01:55:30]  And let me tell you, I live that on a daily basis.  So why don't you go stand by the window so people walking by can think that the aquarium, okay?  I don't know.  Not bad.  He's a little chubby, and I don't like him.  He's not whale-sized.  Yeah, he's really.  He's a baby whale.  I don't know.  Jesus.  I thought he did well.  Rich is just mean.  He's husky.  I like his reasoning.  He's a little chubby, and I don't like us.  All right, Rich.  Bring on the next guy.  Good job.  These are kind of the opening acts. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Do you want to open for Bobby while he's opening for Dane?  Yes.  All right.  That's obsessing with that.  That's number two.  I know, but it's a different opening joke.  All right.  I just like the fact that E-Roc's got his hat to the back.  Oh, I know.  The young Jimmy Olsen.  Jesus.  E-Roc's all business today.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I want to see the first one to fucking give him a car crash.  Yeah.  Holy.  I'm just going to laugh at everything you said.  He's got his fucking little brother shirt on.  This is like Lurch's nephew.  How is your head so big and such small little eyes? 
[01:56:30]  I know.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  You look like a fucking.  You look like a fat chink.  He looks like.  Your next comic, you may have seen him spearing a mastodon.  Yes.  You look like a fat.  You look like a fat baby on Maury.  I know.  He does.  He looks like a little rascal episode.  Our next hack, completely let himself go.  Let's have a big hand for Sean Sullivan. 
[01:57:00]  All right.  Sully.  Sully.  The bring on music.  It's working for the weekend.  How's it going, guys?  Hi, Sean.  I think I've been drinking too much.  I think I'm going to do a 12-step program.  If I can make it up or down 12 steps, pass me another beer.  I'm not drunk enough.  It's a drunk joke.  I got to give it to him.  I thought he was just talking to me.  And like he's ever climbed 12 stairs.  It's cold out and like it sucks. 
[01:57:30]  It's like if it snows and shit.  He's got chips delivery.  People put carrots in his mouth.  This guy's good.  Good, good, good.  But at least you can keep your beers where you keep minorities outside of your house.  All right.  Again, I think he's just talking to me. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  That's good because they really do ruin everything.  How could you think this is cold if you lived through the ice age?  Yeah.  He has deer socks on.  I know.  You guys remember ShamWow?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Woo.  I remember they say that the Germans make good stuff.  I'm like, what is the ShamWow going to pick up 60 million droplets of not the whole entire spill? 
[01:58:30]  Oh, fuck.  I fucked it up.  ShamWow Holocaust joke is not going to go over well.  People kind of saw where it was going, too.  When you said Germans, where else would a ShamWow joke go?  I just said you remember ShamWow.  The commercial came on last night.  Okay.  Wow.  It's not like it's a fucking comedy show.  Making these guys look good.  Does anybody else just have the strong urge to bite his cheeks?  Yeah. 
[01:59:00]  They do look delicious.  Pull your pants down.  Yeah.  Someone farted, too, by the way.  Of course.  Someone just needs spinks.  Go ahead, Sean.  Sean, who's that guy?  Go on.  I recently just got my girl tampons from the store.  I got back, and she said, oh, it's the wrong one.  I need the one with wings.  So I poured Red Bull on it, threw it out of the vagina.  It's not believable, because nobody thinks you have a girlfriend. 
[01:59:30]  What did you say?  Say my sister.  You put what on it and threw it out of the vagina?  Red Bull.  Red Bull.  Red Bull gives you wings.  Oh, okay.  I didn't know.  Okay.  Oh.  I had something with wings.  I haven't heard of wings of a maxi joke in a while.  I haven't heard of him in quite a while.  One more, and then we'll wrap him up.  No, I want him to do 40.  Stretch.  I know, right?  Stretch.  In a plastic bag.  Stretch Armstrong.  Let her rip.  You guys like porn?  I love porn. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, porn.  Yeah, porn.  I've got so much porn, it's enough to shake a fist at.  And I do.  Until I get chased, and I stop.  All right.  Ended on a good note.  All right.  All right.  I'm going to take the mic back.  His finger grips are going to be stuck in it.  That's bad.  Sean, does he want to promote anything?  Sean.  Sean.  Hey, hey.  Sean.  Do you want to promote, like, the Wellmont Theater Saturday?  You got anything you want to promote?  Anything.  Are you deaf in one ear because your father used to hit you in it? 
[02:00:30]  The only thing I can think of, it's an open mic at Finn's Pub.  All right.  And in Oakdale, if you're near Oakdale.  And what's your mix?  Because you do have a very unusual look.  I'm all Irish.  That's just a bloated, drunken face thing.  My mom might have fucked you up, man.  I don't know.  Please look at his ears.  You're not part.  Please look at his little fucking baby ears.  Let me see your little ears.  You're not part.  You look like Mr. Potato Head.  And they just.  It looks like he got stung by a bee.  I know.  You're not part Irish and beady eyes. 
[02:01:00]  What?  You know how hard it is for him?  Rich, we're trying to do jokes.  You know how hard it is going to be for his friend driving home with him going,  No, you did well.  He has no friends.  All right, Sean.  Great job.  His head's sticking out.  That's the guy.  Take it easy, Sean.  He's going to go order some ribs that tip his car over.  Who's next there?  Our next act, when you see him, is the reason people hate Jews.  Let's have a hand for Jason McLean or McLennan. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, no.  Not him.  The guy after.  Sorry.  Wrong intro.  Go back.  Go back.  Is your name Jason?  No, that's the next guy.  Fucked up.  All right.  I didn't see who.  I thought he was coming through the door.  I was looking out the window.  Improv your intro.  This is the guy.  All right.  I'm going to do it right now.  Our next act is not the intro I gave you for our next act.  Bring on Van Gogh already.  Okay.  Talk about old references. 
[02:02:00]  Nah, he nailed it.  He nailed it.  We don't know how he is in comedy, but I'm sure he's a great spot welder.  A big hand for Jason McClennan.  Jason.  Yeah, Jason.  All right.  Go.  Wow.  Thank you, boss.  I appreciate it.  No problem.  First, I want to thank Kenny for the awkward moment in the waiting room because he came in  and one of the guys had a book bag and he walked up.  Just tell Joe.  I'm done.  You told Rick. 
[02:02:30]  I like a guy that works in the moment.  No, it's not.  So anyways, he came in and he saw the guy's book bag and he said, excuse me, sir, would  you mind emptying out your notebook or your bag?  So the guy opened his bag.  But the whole time, Kenny's looking at his boss.  I think he wanted him to empty the other bag.  I like it.  I like that.  When you were in Van Gogh, can it be just go?  I'm nervous.  When you were in Poltergeist 2.  Why don't you ask me when I was on the cover of Mad Magazine, Alfred E. Newman. 
[02:03:00]  All right.  Don't do crowd work.  That's what I do.  Do some fucking act.  Do some fucking act.  Well said.  I'm sorry my hands are shaking.  It's been three hours since I last masturbated.  He just made that up.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he did.  All right.  Everybody related to it.  Go ahead.  I did some Google research before I came in here all about.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I did some Google research before I came in and I found a lot of interesting things.  Like I found out that there is not a minority within 5,906 feet of Anthony Acumia's house 
[02:03:30]  because that is the maximum effective range of a Barrett .50 caliber rifle.  Ah, yeah.  There we go.  I mean, he wrote that.  It's not a joke.  That's fact.  Yeah.  He's just stating facts.  He's just Wikipedia.  Okay.  And then while I was on that search, you would realize if you Google the word masturbation,  you will come back with just about 50 million website results. 
[02:04:00]  If you Google search self-respect, you only get about 16 million.  But the biggest jerk-off phrase term that you could put in Google is government with  939 million web hits.  So the biggest jerk-offs.  Yeah.  I feel like I'm at a fucking conference.  Actually, the alternative guy was like, that was a good one.  Real comedy.  Finally.  Christ, you don't want to leave a show going, well, I got to do research. 
[02:04:30]  You don't want to leave your house doing that.  All right, then.  And you never want to leave a show.  It's the people who paid to see you that don't want to leave.  I should have just let you sign up.  Okay.  Well, I don't know if you realize it, but Anthony is actually a very good movie reviewer.  Oh, thanks.  I asked him what his least favorite Tom Cruise movie was, and he said, Minority Report.  Oh, boy.  Yes.  But, yeah, yeah.  He just tripped over the words a lot.  No, I'm sorry.  But Mississippi Burning is his favorite comedy. 
[02:05:00]  Well, his review went something like this.  Those fucking ass fucking precogs got it all wrong.  They didn't do the research.  I did.  Fuck you, Steven Spielberg, and your daydreaming ass cunts.  Well, I'm sure Steven Spielberg would be that.  Hey, fuck the table.  How high?  I'm just being hypnotized by his fucking Adam's apple going up and down.  You look like half the girls I fucked in. 
[02:05:30]  Look at that bouncing ball.  Look, man, what can I do?  I'm just saying, you're doing great.  I haven't been to New York City in probably 15 years, and I haven't been on a train in  the least that long.  I got on the train this morning.  Do you want to get on Bobby's back?  No, we would pull a train, not get on a train.  Thanks.  Can you do me a favor?  What?  Can you sit where he's sitting?  Why?  Do you want to eat his Adam's apple?  Now it'll turn into a fucking pig roast. 
[02:06:00]  Stop.  Boss, stop.  Right there.  Yeah, two good ones.  His careful always fucking blow.  He always punches himself out.  All right, well, the conductor saw me.  I thought you were done.  No, I'm not done.  Oh, let him go.  He's good.  All right, the conductor looked at me and said, sir, you need to sit down.  I said, I am sitting down.  And he came down, and he said, if you don't behave yourself, you've got to get off the  train.  I'm done.  You've got to give him credit.  You've got to give him credit.  You've got to give him credit for just editing himself. 
[02:06:30]  Any questions for that guy, or we're just going to let him go?  That's fine.  Let's get out of here.  All right, go ahead, Rich.  The next guy.  Look at the walk.  Our next guy walking down Boulevard of Broken Dreams.  You might recognize if you were in the Diamond District this week.  You stop shaking while you read?  Yeah, you just...  You don't have to make faces.  You're ugly enough.  Listen.  Okay.  That's it.  Dr. Vinnie Bull Butts. 
[02:07:00]  Shut up.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Good.  Uh-huh.  Exactly.  Even the microphone was trying to escape.  Voss is actually standing on his chair right now, by the way.  Go ahead, shrimp.  Hey, shrimp.  You've got the gig, Voss.  Just read it.  Exactly.  You're not auditioning.  Just go.  Go.  Go.  Don't stare me up and down.  Let me read the thing.  I'm staring you side to side.  Our next intro. 
[02:07:30]  I know.  Let's have a big hand for Jewy Juju.  Oh, God.  Jeff Grossman.  Jeff Grossman?  Yes.  There he is.  Yeah.  Shabbat shalom, Rich.  How's everybody doing out there?  All right.  Hey.  Glad to be here.  Long drive here today.  You know, I don't know whether there's a God in this world, and honestly, at this point,  I could care less.  But if there is, he's definitely got a bone to pick with fat guys, because the one thing  that makes absolutely no sense to me is that when a fat guy puts on weight, he puts on 
[02:08:00]  weight everywhere except for the one place he'd like to put on weight.  How fucked up is that?  I mean, your cock doesn't get bigger.  I get Pamela Anderson's tits, but I don't get Tommy Lee's cock.  What's up with that?  And think about that for a minute.  And how fucking cool would that be?  Instead of having to go to a big and tall store before a date and getting a stupid shirt  like this one, I could go to McDonald's.  Welcome to McDonald's.  Can I take your order?  Yeah.  I got a big date tonight.  Let me get a Big Mac, Filet-O-Fish, Quarter Pounder, French Fry, Icy Coke, Thick Shake, 
[02:08:30]  Sundae, and yeah, it's March.  Let me get about five of those Shamrock shakes to go, please.  Thank you.  You know what, though?  You know what, dude?  By the way, when you said...  I'm with you on...  Look, dude.  I'm with you on the fat shit.  I'm with you, but you should have...  What the fuck was the end?  I know.  You had me at the big hits.  I'm not done yet.  Oh, shit.  By the way, when you would have said, I don't know if there's a god, if Vos would have just  died, we all would have went, yep. 
[02:09:00]  Look at...  Let it go, Rich.  Let it go.  Go ahead, brother.  He had you when, Jerry Maguire?  I mean...  Come on, go ahead.  Oh, I should keep going.  Okay.  I mean, the funny thing is...  Take your hand out of your pocket.  You look at him.  Yeah, I'm staying comfortably.  Where were you?  It's his ex called Attell.  What's it?  Attell?  No, he's not here.  I love him.  I wish he was.  Exactly.  You fucking Vlasic pickle ad.  Shut up. 
[02:09:30]  I mean, think of how cool it would be if actually, you know, when you got fat, you actually got  the big dick that came with it.  I mean, I could, you know, some people go to a bar, and I could actually be the guy that  drunk chicks look to pick up after they had a few.  You know what?  Actually, that's a stupid fucking idea.  That was horrible.  That's a completely stupid idea.  And, you know, some people dream big.  They dream of playing third base for the Yankees.  Other guys dream of being a doctor, a lawyer.  Apparently, all I'm looking for is an easy way to get a skank to look at me at a bar. 
[02:10:00]  So, thanks for letting me think of that.  Well, hold on.  Hold on.  You know, he had confidence.  Yes.  He did walk in with confidence.  So did Hitler.  Worst comes to worst, we could advertise on his back.  That's what I'm saying.  You know what, dude?  Really?  You guys feel sorry for somebody?  I think if this was...  You.  Bonnie.  Us. 
[02:10:30]  I thought he had confidence out of everybody.  He came in with confidence.  He did.  He came in with confidence.  He had good confidence.  He had nothing after it, but he had confidence.  Yeah, if this was blog comedy, going on and on without a comma or a period.  Did you say blob comedy?  No, that's just what you think when I speak.  Oh, Bob.  Self-deprecating.  We love you, Bobby.  Yes, I never throw comedy into that.  You want to promote anything, sir?  You're good?  I'm a teacher, man. 
[02:11:00]  This is the first time I've ever been in front of an audience to it.  Really?  All right.  That was good.  I'm not looking for sympathy.  I'm not looking for sympathy.  I just came here to have fun, and I'm with some great people.  Can you look for a...  Stop giving a speech like you want something.  Can you do me a favor?  Can you look for...  Can you look for a shirt that fits?  I will.  I will.  Hopefully it's not that special.  What grade do you teach?  What grade?  I teach kindergarten.  What did he say to you?  Are they looking for help?  What grade?  Oh, Uncle Paul.  I teach younger kids.  How old?  Five and six years old. 
[02:11:30]  All right.  That's got to be...  That's hot.  That's hot.  Mentally stimulating, huh?  Do they sit and just stare at you going, ugh?  What do you teach them?  Do you ever have a little girl taking nap time with the milk next to her?  Only when I start speaking.  Oh.  Do you do little jokes in class?  Like, do you practice your set on them?  Absolutely.  Yeah, do that fat cock joke.  Absolutely.  Kindergarteners.  You'd be surprised how well that one went over.  You play sit on my lap?  Right after nap time.  That's exactly what I went to.  You're married, too.  How did that happen?  How did that happen? 
[02:12:00]  I wasn't always this fat.  No, I don't think you're fat.  I think you're just...  Couldn't have been.  Because they voted on gay marriage and they...  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  He's going to the cup.  Wait a minute.  I'll turn it in.  No, it's not legal.  I don't think that's legal in New Jersey.  Exactly.  That was a good visual.  I feel you had a lot of confidence.  I'm joking.  Stop saying confidence.  You've got to start with confidence.  Can we move on?  All right.  Huh?  Can we move on, Rich, please?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Good job.  Thank you, guys.  Hello.  Put the mic back in the stand, dude. 
[02:12:30]  Right behind the line.  This is the last opening act, I believe.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Damn.  The last opener.  Our last opener.  And thank God this is almost done.  So we can go from horrible to horrendous.  Let's have a big hand for David Curley.  David.  He's got a funny name.  Oh, look at him.  So a lot of big NBA news lately.  A lot of big trades going down.  I think the biggest story this year is LeBron James. 
[02:13:00]  I mean, what a rough year he's had off the court.  You know, first he makes the decision to abruptly leave Cleveland, just infuriating the Cavalier  fan.  And then, you know, all these Cavalier fans have been posting racial threats on his Facebook  page all year.  And when I heard about this, it just absolutely baffled me, because I thought black people  only used MySpace.  And on top of that, I didn't know people from Cleveland could afford a computer.  Right?  And I don't know why Anthony's called a Cavalier fan.  So I'm really happy that February's finally over, because I hate Valentine's Day. 
[02:13:30]  Oh.  I was thinking something else.  Yep.  Just take everything he says in this joke and add those words.  Like the Ides of March.  Oh, Chip.  I hate Chip.  So last year, my girlfriend actually broke up with me on Valentine's Day.  Aww. 
[02:14:00]  Lucky her.  I gave her a pair of diamond earrings, and she told me she wasn't getting anything out of  the relationship anymore.  I told her, I wouldn't say that, because I have herpes.  So you have fun with that.  Because diamonds aren't the only thing in our forever.  Not bad.  Not bad.  Not bad.  Not bad.  It was pretty good.  You're graded on a curve.  So, you know, I've been getting back into the dating scene, and I recently just signed  up for a profile on eHarmony.  And you know what? 
[02:14:30]  eHarmony is actually not that bad.  You know, if you're looking for a chick from Long Island with five kids and a blown out  vagina, it's definitely the website for you.  Hey, that's good.  That's good.  If you want one from New Jersey, I can give you a number.  He's making fun of his own wife.  You don't have to explain it each other.  Yes, I did.  It came out like dramatic prose.  As long as Anthony gets it, I don't give a fuck.  Anthony knows comedy, okay?  All right?  When Anthony likes you, he'll go like that. 
[02:15:00]  Okay?  How hard is it to hold a cup with those little stiff fingers?  Just as hard as it is for you to wear a tin strap.  All right.  It's very difficult.  Shut up, fucking gargoyle.  See?  I got greedy.  I know.  And you shook a lot.  I do.  You shook a lot.  Why did I take away your meatloaf?  And he's back in.  It's as fast as that.  He is in and out. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  Six seconds in and out real quick.  Bob carries meatloaf in his pocket.  That's just me.  That's a guy finish, right?  He's doing it.  That's right.  Yeah.  He's got a fucking second.  Yeah.  We didn't even know you were still here.  I did that one.  So, uh, I'm from Charleston, and I'm a real big drinker, and you have to be careful in Charleston  now, because they're really cracking down on drunk driving.  They are setting up DUI checkpoints everywhere.  And I don't really know how effective a DUI checkpoint is, because if the cops are really  interested in catching the highest concentration of drunk drivers on any given evening, all 
[02:16:00]  they'd have to do is hang out at the end of a Taco Bell drive-thru after midnight.  And you wouldn't even need a breathalyzer.  You just need to see what people are ordering, because everybody knows the drunker you are, the  more ambitious you are with a meal you can put down.  All right, sir.  Bring the car to a stop.  Let me take a look at the bag.  Two chicken soft tacos with no cheese.  Well, you're obviously sober, because that's the gayest meal I've ever seen.  So why don't you take your Mazda Miata and get the fuck out of here?  He's fucking doing character. 
[02:16:30]  That's good.  Well, you know what, though?  It was good, and that car crash was perfect.  He said, pull the car up, and you crashed it.  I know, that crashed it.  But he wasn't drunk, you know.  Yeah, it's nice when it all comes together, isn't it?  He actually wasn't bad.  He was good.  He was good.  He looks like an ESPN news anchor, but I know.  He was good.  He looks like every FedEx guy or something.  He's got that generic guy look.  What was your name again?  Dave Corley. 
[02:17:00]  Jesus Christ.  What happened?  Oh, shit.  Danny gassed.  Danny gassed.  Danny just gassed, and Bobby's fucking...  He was watching himself on YouTube.  We got to get the fart mask if you're going to do that.  Oh, my God.  We have to show these guys.  It smells like yeast and...  Danny, you got another one in you?  All right, Danny.  Wow, Danny's really killing with the fucking gas.  Bobby, you got to do the fart mask for the people today. 
[02:17:30]  The what?  The fart mask.  It's our latest adventure.  We'll show you.  You have to do it.  You have to.  If you fucking hurt ribs, I'll fucking re-hurt.  Oh, God.  Sweetie.  I don't want to re-hurt.  I'll try.  Rich, what were you going to say?  I just wanted to know how long you've been doing this.  Oh, God.  I've been doing stand-up for a little over a year.  Oh, not bad.  From where you're working out of?  Charleston, South Carolina.  Oh, cool.  Do you got my number?  Yes.  You got my number?  No, I don't.  Good.  Bye. 
[02:18:00]  What the fuck?  No, you were good, man.  Wow.  You had to ask him twice.  I know.  I like the guy.  You all knew he didn't have your number.  Were you the Catskills?  Are you having a good time?  Tell your face.  Shut up.  Let him promote someone.  You want to promote anything, sir?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll be at Theater 99 in Charleston on March 19th and also the first Thursday of every month  at Club Light in Charleston.  And what's your name again?  Did he get up from fucking South Carolina for this fucking horrible?  Yeah, he did.  What's your name?  Wow.  Dave Corley.  Dave Corley.  All right.  Dave Corley. 
[02:18:30]  People in that area will look for Dave Corley.  That was a good job.  Good job, man.  It was a good set.  Good job.  Good job.  I need a thing of water.  You guys can't even get comics from New York to come in.  He drove up from fucking South Carolina for this?  Daniel, he doesn't have to leave, does he?  Make him stay.  For what?  You want to take him home?  Exactly.  I'm sure Bonnie wouldn't mind.  He's not taking a train right now.  Exactly.  Give him a chair.  He's going for a glass of water, you idiot.  You think he drove up and he's driving right back? 
[02:19:00]  We should get the plug in, take a break, and then we're going to get the finalists on.  Yes.  You mean Car Crash Comedy brought to you by the Borgata Hotel, Casino, and Spa.  I love the place.  Visit Borgata.com.  All right.  We'll break and we'll continue.  Can I get my plug in?  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  This week, the Stress Factory.  Next weekend, the Arlington Cinema Drafthouse.  Stress Factory is selling out, so get there.  Stress Factory?  Stress.  I said Stress Factory.  No, you didn't.  Whatever.  I got gum in my mouth.  I don't like that you're trying to panic the people into buying tickets.  I'm not at all.  It's selling out fast. 
[02:19:30]  Get them out.  You could go Sunday and get tickets.  I won't be there.  Exactly.  It's not a monster truck show.  Okay.  Sunday, it's selling out fast.  I'm not doing a door deal.  I'm just, you know, they want to see a good show.  Come.  But Arlington Cinema Drafthouse.  I'm just going to be honest with you.  I'm at Point Pleasant.  Uncle Vinny's tonight.  There's going to be three people there.  And you're two of them.  And we'll be right back with Car Crash Comedy.  Stay there. 
[02:20:00]  You missed that one.  That was terrific.  Listen, the point is that he's saying he doesn't care, but he cares.  I know he doesn't care.  That's what we're confused about.  I'm trying to have a connection with him.  I don't really care.  I'm trying to say, oh, we connected somehow.  You did on your IQ test.  Fucking Jimmy.  That was good.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Well, he's really good at that type of thing. 
[02:20:30]  Professional.  Hey, I'm not personal.  What?  I don't think you're a mongoloid at all.  Thank you.  It's nice to say.  Rich, anybody else in the crowd?  Or Bobby, anyone else in the crowd you want to talk to before we bring on our finals?  The guy who can't quite cross his arms up front?  He thought he was all safe.  I want to talk to Uncle Paul in the back.  Oh, yeah.  Hi, Ernie.  One of these things just doesn't.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  He's a bit older than the rest of them.  A bit older?  Hey, can I ask you a question? 
[02:21:00]  Did you drive all these people here?  He used to tell everyone he was Captain Kangaroo and would get them in the back.  I want to talk to you about diabetes.  I was just kidding.  One of our fans of more advanced years than our usual fans.  You've aged me prematurely.  He's actually 23.  He's mother time. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, God.  Mother time.  Mother time.  Oh, that wasn't a bad one.  It was horrible.  I understood.  It wasn't bad.  I can't wait to be that age where you just tuck everything and don't give a shit.  Oh, well, obviously, you are that age.  Oh, man.  Well, it's here.  What's your name, sir?  How old are you?  How old?  58.  That's very ageist, Bob.  You look younger than 58. 
[02:22:00]  What's your name?  Mike.  Okay.  Mike?  What do you mean that's ageist?  Look at his face.  That's ageist.  Are you married?  Yeah.  Get out.  That door or this door?  Do you cheat?  No.  Look at me.  Are you offering?  That's pretty good.  The guy's got a few years' experience under his belt.  He's probably, you know, had a few comebacks down there at the VFW Hall.  Playing some P-Knuckle. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, just hanging out with the guys, talking about these people.  Yeah.  Look at him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And pointing at the black guy.  You ever go to one of the halls, though?  It's always the white guys on the wall, and they have, like, one black guy on a lone wall.  Some veteran.  He's called a president.  That's not bad.  Not bad.  Political joke.  I'm surprised you knew.  Yeah.  What do you do for work?  What do I do? 
[02:23:00]  I work in a lab.  No shit.  Wow, that's exciting.  Your left eye's a little weaker than your...  You make a lot of ray turns when you're driving.  Is it really hard to take semen samples out of diapers?  We'll talk later.  Give it...  Those rascals.  Oh, all right.  Well, you seem like a nice fella.  How long have you been listening to this debacle?  Long time.  Long time.  Since you first came to New York. 
[02:23:30]  Since we first came to New York.  Was your hair gray then, or did it gray in time?  Not as much as it is now, but we still still have it.  At least you got it, right?  How long have you had the mustache?  60s?  60s.  Probably.  Yeah, early 70s.  Yes.  Can I smell it?  This is like the Warren Commission.  What's that?  We're just asking.  Why are we fascinated with a man who's over 40?  Like, wow, what...  Mike demands an apology.  Well, this...  Mike demands an apology. 
[02:24:00]  Exactly.  What are we doing?  Everybody on the table's over 40.  That's what I'm saying.  We're all asking him, like, did you have gray hair?  Who gives a shit?  It's called filler.  Worst interviews ever.  Bobby, pick someone else.  All right.  Who else you want to talk to?  Hey, did you ever use a water fountain that he couldn't use?  It's a horrible question to ask for this guy.  I'm always getting shit here, man.  I want to talk...  We should talk to the black guy.  That's Carlton.  Let me ask you a question.  That's Carlton.  He's been on many times.  Yeah, we know Carlton. 
[02:24:30]  He's done some great bits for us.  I never met him.  I'm sorry.  How about one of the girls?  When you're running with a TV on your shoulder...  Wait a minute.  First, do you have any TVs for sale?  You can rest assured when he's running you're not on it.  A TV.  Uh-huh.  That was a TV.  That was a bad.  Yeah, because, I mean, it couldn't be...  40 failed pilots.  That's right.  Jesus.  All right, that hurts too.  Yes, Rich.  We should talk to the girls.  Let's talk to the girls.  We're two girls.  We're talking to the girls.  Can you stand up? 
[02:25:00]  Nobody knows how to talk to the girls.  Stand up.  Stand up.  Both of you.  They're pointing to the...  Stand up and come out here so you can be next to each other.  They're pointing to the one in the back where she might be crazy or something.  Oh, really?  She's got that crazy look.  Stand next to each other.  Hold hands.  Hold hands.  Hold hands?  I'm sure you're comfortable.  You look like a 3D mug shot.  Do you want us to kiss?  Yeah.  Wow, she jumps right into it.  All right.  Wow.  Just kidding.  Sorry.  You're always going to be the other girl.  Whoa.  Oh, shit.  Me?  Rich.  What is that?  Just because she's a little chubby.  Oh, hell no. 
[02:25:30]  Shut up.  You're not me.  There's people on the...  She's not.  She's cute.  No, she's cute.  She's all right.  I'm not getting around.  She's very cute.  You're all right.  On a Tuesday before 12.  What's that?  You want to know the show has no fucking women listeners?  First one, you get up, you call her chunky.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, God.  She's not.  She's not.  So she looks thin, okay?  What the fuck?  Yeah, come here, buddy.  I'm not saying she's chunky.  I didn't say that once.  They're both adorable.  But the other one, you could tell, is a little more weathered, beaten down, and sexy.  Holy shit. 
[02:26:00]  Thank you.  It's her last two female listeners.  It's the last two.  It's the last two.  She does look like she's from Cape Cod.  Her boyfriend is a fucking jacked up guy in the back.  I hope he fucking...  I can't wait to see Voss trying to explain this outside.  I'm falling for the show.  That's my brother.  Oh, really?  That's my brother.  Even hotter.  You got any stories?  When you were in Billy Jack, and you were taught... 
[02:26:30]  Go ahead.  Another great reference.  Stop.  Stop.  Wow.  That was...  I get...  Dude, fuck you.  It's way too...  That's a good reference.  It is a good reference.  I get what you're saying.  Put your headphones on.  You're stepping on everyone.  She looks like that girl who Clint Eastwood put in all his movies.  The woman's name is Sandra Locke.  It was his girlfriend for a long time, and she was raped in Sudden Impact.  She was also almost captured by a bunch of Mexicans and the outlaw Josie Wales. 
[02:27:00]  All right, computer, Jim.  And the guy was like, you cunt!  Remember that?  He grabbed Sandra Locke by the shirt.  You cunt!  So you guys don't know each other.  You got to...  Everyone's telling you.  They're not on.  They're not on.  Oh, the headphones aren't on.  Oh, turn them on.  He rocks.  Jimmy Olsen, get in here.  Get in here.  Jimmy Olsen.  He rocked, everyone.  He rocked.  So do you have a boyfriend?  Yes, I do.  Do you have a boyfriend, sweetie?  Yeah, he's right there.  Oh, where is he?  Hey, what's that?  Another guy that could kick your ass.  Why are you in the front of her?  Oh, there was no seat available? 
[02:27:30]  How long have you been going out with him?  Like, almost three years.  Oh, I thought it was hers.  That's cool.  And now, did you bring her into O&A?  Oh, yeah.  She liked it.  Wait, were you guys fucking lying?  Who'd you supposed to...  Well, no.  He got me into the show.  Oh, okay.  My first Christmas gift.  Yeah?  Was what?  The accent?  What was your second?  A power song?  Yeah, right?  Why don't you shit on your chest?  I got you XM, Opie, and this. 
[02:28:00]  Now, what about you?  Are you into the show?  Did he get you into the show?  Actually, I don't know that much.  I am sorry, but it's hysterical.  And I didn't know that much, except for when I was in college, my friends from Long Island  told me when I see a WOW bumper sticker to take off my top.  So, it started a really bad habit, and now I take off my top all the time, and I say  whip them out Wednesday.  So, what are you waiting for?  What are you waiting for?  They were on the air.  Whip them out.  Get those peaches out of that box.  My brother's here.  My brother's here.  So, what?  Well, tell them to close his eyes.  Hey, earmuffs, asshole. 
[02:28:30]  Let's go.  Well, you can't hear.  No, you can't hear.  You can't hear.  Scott's cock plucker.  No, he's right, though.  We want you to.  Believe me.  We're not allowed to.  No, not in this.  We're in the lobby.  Oh.  Jimmy had to put in those.  We're in the lobby.  I can't argue that one already.  Did you see how fast Danny ran in?  Danny ran in.  He went over there and punched her in the cunt.  Just make her stop.  All right.  Good point.  Good point.  We want you to.  That was a trooper that she was willing to do. 
[02:29:00]  I know.  Thank you, Meredith Baxter-Burney.  Medium.  Can you go in the bathroom with a cell phone and take a picture of him and just bring  it back in for me and Jimmy so we can just.  That's probably something you shouldn't do either.  And visit Bobby's career.  There's this big guy, Kenny, following me around.  You all let me do that.  That's club.  Sorry.  Wait a minute.  Ross had something to say.  What did you say?  I think she's very sexy.  There's something about her I think is very sexy.  You know what I mean?  Whether it's sexy?  Yeah.  No.  No.  No.  If you knew how stupid you look with your headphones like that.  I get in the air rage when I have them. 
[02:29:30]  No, you don't.  You don't know how they work.  You didn't have to say with your headphones like that, by the way.  I know.  Of course not.  Let's.  I guess we should move on.  Yeah.  Let's go.  Yeah.  Let's.  All right.  Thank you, ladies.  Ladies.  Thank you.  I hope you.  Oh, look at her.  She's like, oh.  Made it through.  There you go.  No problem.  We like our female listeners.  Yeah.  All two of them.  Two.  22-year-old female demographic.  22-year-old female?  Is that how old you are?  Yeah.  You've been going out for three years?  Uh, yeah.  How old are you, sir?  23?  Oh.  Okay. 
[02:30:00]  I thought maybe you were like, yeah.  Everybody grab your wallets.  Okay.  All right.  We're ready for the finalists of Car Crash.  Let's do it.  Oh, boy.  Rich, you ready?  Our first guy.  Oh, hold on.  So what are we going to do?  These guys are going to compete, and then we're going to knock it down to two.  Two people, yeah.  And then they're going to, all right, do the finals.  Great.  So who's our next comic there, Rich?  Our next comic.  And now the real deal starts, folks.  This is not bullshit.  This is for the big money.  No practice.  This is not Hollywood week anymore. 
[02:30:30]  This is the real deal.  So let's have a big hand.  No, we got to let these guys do their material.  They're competing for real money.  It's been a serious business.  Let's have our first act.  Let's have a big hand for Mark and Durko.  All right.  How many teams?  How's everybody doing, guys?  Cool setup we got going here.  I was watching TV in my hotel yesterday, and I was watching one of my favorite shows. 
[02:31:00]  Is that show where they go around, you know, catching crabs for an hour?  The Bachelor?  It's a good one.  I like that show because there's always a twist, man.  I got an idea for a season of The Bachelor.  This is what I'm going to do.  Bachelor, full-blown AIDS.  The girls have no fucking clue.  You would tune in every week for that because we can make it a couple different shows.  When he starts sleeping with them, we can call it The Deadliest Catch.  If he marries one of them, we can call it John and Kate plus AIDS.  We can do a 10-year follow-up show called Survivor. 
[02:31:30]  Whoever has the highest T-cell count gets the money.  I was watching Obama on the news yesterday, too.  He was talking about Mexico or something.  Man, does he look like shit lately.  He's all, like, pale and amiciated, man.  He started off like a cool black lawyer, serious.  He was like Denzel in Philadelphia.  Now he looks more like Tom Hanks at the end of Philadelphia.  He loves AIDS.  That's the name of your CD, AIDS Medley. 
[02:32:00]  All right, yeah, so no more AIDS stuff.  That's cool.  Go ahead, do it.  His follow-up CD is back in the AZT.  Go ahead.  Wow.  That wasn't for him.  That was for Bob Kelly.  Go ahead, so you got at least a minute.  Yeah, I can't really make fun of anybody's appearance.  I'm a fucking ugly creep, too.  I look like an awkward cross between Prince William and Rocky Dennis from Mask.  I like how you threw in the Prince William part. 
[02:32:30]  Fuck you guys.  You guys can laugh after I'm done with that, but I'm getting Prince William in there first.  The fucked-up thing is I don't have his money or power, just his horse face, so it's not  that cool.  I mean, look at me.  I'm a fucking mess.  I'm sweating from a job that has the word standing in the description.  All right, I'm going to leave you with a little joke before I go.  I'm not too good with the girls because all those AIDS jokes and rape jokes, they don't 
[02:33:00]  really work over too well.  So, you know, I was going to the bar the other day.  It doesn't really matter which bar because the story's made up.  But I didn't want to be a pussy, so, you know, I went over there.  I thought I'd talk to a girl, so I found a tent at the corner of the bar.  You know, I looked past her, tried to find, like, a six or a seven, you know, so I have  a chance.  Walk up to her, talking to her for a few minutes, thought I was going, all right.  Offer to buy her a drink.  You know what this bitch does?  Says, thank you.  Gives a drink to her boyfriend.  Normally, that would piss me off, but it was fucking hilarious watching her boyfriend  down that roofie.  And here's my critique. 
[02:33:30]  I thought it was really good, and I think your personal stuff, you know, is, no, it  is, because that's what people remember.  When you talk about your life and it's personal, then it's fucking original, because, you know,  you do have a horse face, but you do.  I wanted to throw sugar cubes at you while you were up there.  But you have nice lips. 
[02:34:00]  You should talk about those cock-sucking lips you have.  I didn't think I got you this fucking show.  Your lips with Rich's lifestyle.  See, because you're queer.  But, see, and just from my experience, I think the personal stuff went over really well.  You know, it's good.  It's some good age stuff.  You know what I mean?  But didn't you think, though, that the roofie thing, guys, just a little hurtful?  I thought it was very good.  It was funny. 
[02:34:30]  It was good.  It was good.  Good job.  There was a couple things in there that were a little...  A little pitchy.  A little...  Dog.  A little pitchy.  You guys could have really just left it and it was funny.  I got all the critique right now.  Hold on.  Bobby's got to give his...  That was good.  No.  Thank you.  I like it.  All right.  Let's move on.  Good job.  I got a plug-in?  Yeah, sure.  Can we just...  Comedian Mark on Twitter.  Comedian Mark.  M-A-R-K or C?  Is that K or C, you motherfucker?  It's a K.  All right.  Is that an M? 
[02:35:00]  I'm not a black guy.  I'm not a black guy.  No, boss, if the S was a K or C for Comedian.  All right, boss, our next comedian.  Oh, okay.  Good job.  You did all right, right?  I can't wait until D.L.  Hugh Glee comes in.  Yeah.  I'm actually scared of most deaf coming in here and dropping down his comedy rhymes.  He was in the last contest, I think.  He was in Washington.  He was in D.C. 
[02:35:30]  That's right.  He was, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Our next act, let's have a big hand for Ramon Rivez.  Hello, Ramon.  Ramon.  Yes.  All right.  Hello.  Hi.  My name is Ramon.  I'm from Cleveland, so as you can imagine, I'm unemployed right now.  I've been applying for jobs.  Like, even places I know aren't going to be open very long.  I applied at this store called Native Kichwa Arts.  They sell nothing but Native American stuff. 
[02:36:00]  And I gave the guy my resume, and he looked at it.  He was like, everything looks pretty good, Mr. Rivez.  I just got a quick question for you.  What do you know about ancient spirits?  And I was like, well, that depends.  Do you guys drug test?  Because if you do, I'm not going to bother answering.  So that's why I got me to waste a week of my life.  No, thank you.  I've been living with my sister to save money, and she has a couple kids, and I realized  I'm staying with her.  I love the kids very much, but they're growing into little assholes.  Like, my niece came home from school the other day.  I was like, hey, how was your day? 
[02:36:30]  She was like, it was okay.  Some girl tried to sit with me at lunch, but I told her she was too ugly, and she wasn't  allowed.  And I looked at her.  I was like, Amarisa, you know you're fat, right?  Like, she's big.  I, uh...  You don't mind wearing their clothing?  No.  Not at all.  I, uh...  So I'm trying to think of ways to make money, so I've been thinking about writing a Where's  Waldo book, but I'm not sure if you're supposed to draw Waldo first and put everything around  him, or if you draw everything else and say, all right, now where do I put him now? 
[02:37:00]  And, like, I smoke so much pot, I think I'm going to forget to put him in a puzzle or  two, which has me kind of worried, because I don't think you can proofread a Where's Waldo  book.  The guy would just be like, wow, this one's just really hard.  All right.  And, uh, I, uh, while I was looking up research for that joke, I found out there's actually  a Hispanic version of Where's Waldo called Donde Estar Ronaldo.  Donde Estar Ronaldo, uh, it's a lot, it's a lot easier than Where's Waldo, because it's  like, Donde Estar Ronaldo, there he is under the car. 
[02:37:30]  Look at that.  That was easy.  That was fairly obvious.  Uh, one of my favorite things to do is to try to start, uh, trending topics on Twitter,  and, uh, we started this one Joanne Fabrics slogans.  Uh, I'm going to do a couple for you before I get out of here.  Uh, the first one is, Joanne Fabrics, why not make a scarf, since you can't make a baby?  Hey, Joanne Fabrics.  That's the first one.  Uh, I wanted to do, all right, thank you. 
[02:38:00]  Uh, very critical.  He saved it on the end with his fucking uncomfortable serial personality.  I know.  But, I'll mumble to myself.  Very original, I'll say that.  The material stuff was very original.  So it wasn't that shirt.  Yeah.  Would you come here from hunting?  Yeah, gay hunting.  Are you doubling as a picnic table?  Yes.  See, Bobby had it, and he just followed up.  I don't fucking know.  It's just, you dome against the wall. 
[02:38:30]  If they stick, they come.  They never stick.  They're not like your back.  I like cum.  But I thought it would be very original.  Some of the jokes were weak, but some were very funny.  Your opening joke, you probably shouldn't open with it.  You should open with something a little harder.  Okay.  But I thought at least it was very original content.  I thought it was good.  And you should get clothes that fit.  Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you.  I think you should go a little bit.  Yeah, stop trying to be trendy.  Stop trying to be, hey, I'm fucking kooky dressed.  Just get some good clothes.  He doesn't know how to dress.  I shop at thrift stores. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, well, shop at the bigger ones.  You want to promote something, sir?  Fucking bedbugs.  Get the fuck out of here.  You're like a Puerto Rican Louis Anderson-type character.  You didn't want to promote?  You want to promote?  Yeah.  That's great.  What soup kitchen will be at?  I produce a show in Cleveland called Chuckle Fuck, Chuckle FCK.  It's a podcast, and I use Stream to show every Monday night.  So if anyone wants to.  All right, good.  Okay, good job, man.  Thanks, man.  Good job, brother.  Way to go, buddy.  You dropped something.  Hey, hey, hey.  Where are you going to be washing dishes? 
[02:39:30]  See, that's a Mexican joke.  He came back in.  Oh, boy.  Now it's all good.  Oh, God.  He got so...  He's just looking around.  Oh, God.  He said that.  Oh, God.  Very uncomfortable.  All right, Rich.  Who's our next comedian?  Our next act, you might recognize him.  Come on.  From all...  Who said come on?  Did he say...  Everyone is saying it.  The whole audience said that.  Let's have a big hand for Seton Smith.  Oh, Seton.  Right.  You know him.  He did tie him on one of our virus shows. 
[02:40:00]  Also did tie him in a few correctional institutions.  All right.  So, I got this ticket, right?  First of all, I'm not a cop fan.  And I realize that's just a black thing.  White people, you hate cops too, right?  Like, all right?  Like, you ever know dumb things around cops  just because you get so nervous around them?  Like, you ever had a stop sign  and a cop pulls up next to you?  You try something really stupid?  Like, try to look safe?  Anybody try something for him?  Like, a cop pulls up next to you and you're like...  Good job, officer.  There's no cocaine back here. 
[02:40:30]  I'll tell you that, right?  Cop went to my car, right?  Gave me a lecture, right?  Like, you know, give me a ticket  and then we want to talk about it.  I don't want to talk about it.  I know I'm in the wrong, right?  My girlfriend left me.  She wanted to talk about it.  Bitch, I know I cheated on you.  I don't want to talk about it, right?  Like, my girl...  Like, so, cop went to my car.  It was like, you were going 83, sir.  Like, he's never seen 83 before, you know?  Like, I went Mach 5 on his ass or something, right?  You broke the sound barrier, sir.  I didn't do that  because I didn't want to go to jail.  But man, I would love to say that one thing  to shut him up.  Just that one thing.  You were going 83, sir.  Yeah.  Because I don't drive like a bitch, all right? 
[02:41:00]  So, uh...  One minute.  All right.  Almost kind of sort of funny.  Here we go.  So, I'm 29 now, right?  Trying to become an adult.  Trying to do adult shit, right?  You know what I'm saying?  Like, I started cleaning my house, right?  You know what I mean?  Like, I got a futon.  I got a bed instead of a futon bullshit.  You know what I did?  I did the most adult thing I've ever done, ever.  And that is, I started buying my own cable.  You ever tried that shit before?  I actually bought it?  You know what I mean?  Like, not that stealing shit.  I called Comcast.  I was like, yo, son, let's make this legal.  They're like, what are you talking about? 
[02:41:30]  And I hung up real quick because I'm afraid of commitment.  You know what I'm talking about?  And that's why...  You know, and I got my own internet, man.  My own fucking internet.  It's called...  It's wireless.  It's called Seaton Sins the shit, right?  And the...  No.  And the password is nigger, nigger, nigger, right?  Because I...  No, just in case my white friends come over,  they can't be like,  I can't type this password.  You better not type that password, Tom.  You better not.  You better not see Google on your laptop, motherfucker.  All right, I'm done.  That's good, man. 
[02:42:00]  That was funny.  They support each other.  Standing up agent.  And you know what?  I have to give him his actual...  His look.  Yeah.  He could be a star with that.  He's got a good look.  I don't think I'd work on the hair.  Looks like an underwater volcano.  To do comedy right after you saw a ghost  makes it fucking almost impossible.  But what I thought...  Oh, boy.  Okay, what do you mean?  The hair.  Boo.  Wow.  What happened?  All right, shut up.  That one actually happened. 
[02:42:30]  But here's the thing,  what I liked about him,  except to the end,  and I'll be honest,  it was going great because you were doing...  But then it's the whole...  And my white friends.  You know, the whole white...  What do you want him to do?  He's fucking black.  He's surrounded by white people.  What do you want him to do?  Go up there and talk...  Hey, politics.  No, I...  He's black.  He's talking about this...  Yeah, but...  He's got to say the N-word  at least a couple times.  I didn't mind that  because we all say that.  I've got to agree with him  on that one.  Actually, Anthony snores that. 
[02:43:00]  Ah, nigga, nigga, nigga.  Nigga, nigga, nigga.  Nigga, nigga, nigga.  God damn.  Good job.  I think it was a really good job.  You look good.  You get a lot of good...  You know, the fucking outfit  and all that creepy...  I like the shirt.  ...village shit.  You're wearing clothes.  You're top of it.  He's a gorgeous guy.  He was very good.  You were very funny at the end.  I think he picked it up  at the end.  And just so the people know,  he won Car Crash Comedy  in Washington.  Is this the guy  that did the O&A show?  Yeah, yeah.  And he got to do time 
[02:43:30]  in front of one of the virus shows.  He did better than Babiglia.  They liked him.  Babiglia.  Babiglia.  Whatever the fuck his name is.  Stop taking ours out.  He killed in front of our audience.  I know.  In one of our shows, too.  I remember.  I just want to make sure  he knows I remember.  Thank you, man.  Thank you very much.  Stop taking ours out.  That's what Lonnie's parents said.  Hey, bro,  what are you promoting,  by the way?  Anything?  Oh, yeah.  Go to my funnyordie.com  Seton Smith.  Funnyordie.com  Seton Smith.  I got a new video up there 
[02:44:00]  that I really like.  It's funny.  Hey, who's Seton?  S-E-A-T-O-N-Smith.  Are you working?  He's talking to Voss.  He works.  Are you going to be  at the Stress Factory  this weekend?  No.  You ever play Uncle Vinny's  in Point Pleasant?  Oh, wait.  You're in D.C., right?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm at the Arlington Cinema  Draft House next week.  Why don't you have him  come and do his spot?  I can't follow that.  Good job, man.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Love him.  He was good. 
[02:44:30]  He was good.  Yeah.  Our last comic,  then we've got to decide  the two final.  So far, I'd say Seton  is the,  he's a good performer  and, you know,  the material is energy.  He's good.  Our next act.  Don't cut me off.  You spent an hour  talking about  and I say one nice thing  and you're like,  oh, yeah.  We have to move along.  I'm sorry.  I thought you were done.  I didn't know.  I'm kidding.  Go ahead, producer.  Go ahead, producer.  Actually, Bedusa.  Bedusa.  Yeah, Bedusa.  Bedusa. 
[02:45:00]  Who's your favorite  What's Happening character?  Ian.  So what?  No R's.  Yeah, I'm glad you didn't  left.  That was a serious point.  All kidding aside.  All right.  The final comedian there, Rich.  I hate to be our next act  who's following our last act.  Let's have a big hand  for Bill Squire  from the yes,  from the yes.  Billy Squire.  Bill Squire.  There you go.  Oh.  All right.  Thank you.  So my name's Bill Squire.  I'm getting too fat.  That's why I dress like this.  I'm not trying to look nice.  I'm just trying to hide everything 
[02:45:30]  and I got to wear a tire  so this button's going to fly off  and hit this lady in the face  and that's not a good way  to meet women.  Like, hey,  remember when my button  hit you in the face  because of my obesity?  Would you like anything else  of mine to hit you in the face?  Like a light kiss,  you perverts.  And I,  when I go to the grocery store,  people ask me  where the junk food is.  Like, hey dude,  where are the Twinkies?  I'm like,  it doesn't matter.  I have them all.  And I got,  I got this one friend  who's always trying  to help me lose weight.  He's like,  Bill,  losing weight's not hard.  All you got to do  is watch what you eat. 
[02:46:00]  Like,  what do you have for breakfast?  I'm like,  cereal.  He's like,  how many bowls you have?  I'm like,  how many bowls are in a box?  What kind of milk do you use?  Whipped cream.  It's really good.  It's nice.  I have stretch marks.  So do I.  But I like to think  of them as stretch marks.  I like to pretend  that they're tattoos of flames.  Just,  oh.  Ah,  shit.  If I take my shirt off  in public,  people are like,  hey man,  who did your tats? 
[02:46:30]  I'm like,  trans fats.  Look at all the guys  that he,  they know he's killing.  They're all fucking  up,  their heads down.  at their phones.  They're calling the rides.  When he's finished.  The fat guy's killing me.  Stop Bob Kelly.  I'm broke.  The whole audience?  I'm broke right now.  And I hate being broke.  And it's terrible.  And I, 
[02:47:00]  fuck.  Got a gift.  Yeah,  yeah,  give me.  I got a gift.  I got a gift.  That's not fair.  That's not fair.  We interrupted.  We interrupted.  Sorry,  dude.  I hate being broke.  Because I'm tired of people  from India calling me  and telling me to pay  my credit card bills.  If you had that problem,  this is how you deal with them  because they'll call me up  and be like,  hello,  Mr. Squire,  could you please make a payment  on your card  on this day?  I'm like,  yeah,  I'll pay.  I'll pay right now.  I'll pay every last penny.  All the late fees,  all the interest,  everything,  right now. 
[02:47:30]  If you can say caterpillar.  Calipater,  damn it.  I'll talk to you tomorrow.  Good luck.  It's going to be rhinoceros.  Thank you.  That was good, man.  Very good.  Very good.  Is that it?  I got more.  Do 10 more minutes.  10 more minutes.  I'm sure you got more,  but I think that was time,  right?  That was good.  I wouldn't worry about it. 
[02:48:00]  You did great.  I think Bobby should critique him.  Oh,  okay.  I think it's good  that we interrupted him  because that happens in a club.  That's true.  Got a little flustered.  A little flustered.  A little fucked up,  but he pulled it back together.  Yeah,  but it was fucking great.  Bill's a funny guy.  You know him from before this?  That fucking stretch.  I want to steal that.  Dude,  I want to steal that from him.  That is good.  Flames.  Rich,  I'm going to say something.  Great it for where we going. 
[02:48:30]  I liked him.  I,  you know,  it's just,  he was funny.  I fucking liked him.  Right on.  You're sitting there,  you're laughing.  It's early in the morning.  This is tough stuff,  you know?  So,  what do you want to promote there?  I'll promote my website,  BillSquire.com.  Okay.  That kind of thing.  All right.  I think we should take a break,  decide who the two finals are going to be,  and we'll wrap this up.  We've got to go with three  if he's one of them.  Why?  Because he's fat.  Oh,  wow,  Voss.  Jesus.  Holy mother of God.  All right,  we'll take a quick break.  We'll finish Car Crash Comedy next.  Stay there.  Live from the Sirius XM studios 
[02:49:00]  in New York City  is the OPN Anthony Show's  Car Crash Comedy.  All right,  we're back.  Car Crash Comedy  live from the Fish Bowl.  Yeah.  I do believe everyone's  having a good time.  The medicine woman  just walked by.  James Seymour.  James Seymour.  Looking pretty fucking hot.  What?  For an old broad?  She just looks like any old mom  or grandmother or something.  All right,  good point.  All I'm thinking of  is getting my Jane Seymour photo. 
[02:49:30]  That's all I want to do.  Now you're obsessing with the getting.  I want to get her  and Alan Arkin.  I'm dying to get Alan Arkin.  Alan Arkin's coming in today.  Yeah.  In bed.  Really?  What's that?  Anything's old.  And then he looks at his phone  like he wasn't trying.  Anybody with a high school education  is old to him.  Jesus.  And smart.  DM right 71,  go fuck yourself.  So we're going to bring them  all back in.  What's the matter, Rich?  You all right, Rich?  Yeah,  these fucking tweets,  these fucking showwaters.  Just block them.  That's the best thing.  Just block them.  Why are you paying attention to that? 
[02:50:00]  Because you got to pay attention  to your fan.  What?  He'll lose them.  Fuck.  I love blocking them.  You type something to them.  What do you say?  Read it.  And then block them  and they can't get to you?  Yeah.  You give them a private message too  so he doesn't even get the satisfaction  of being retweeted.  You just send them a private message  like fuck your mother's asshole  and your father sucks your cock  and shit like that.  And then block.  That's it.  It's great.  Fuck you.  And then you know they typed,  they took like an hour and a half,  told their friends their little tweet.  How's this one?  How's, you should say, 
[02:50:30]  all right, boom, I'm going to send it.  Hit send.  Blocked.  Boo.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  I got to a fucking.  It's the little pleasures in life.  I go to a huge fight  with like a nine-year-old  on Xbox Live.  Oh, really?  Fucking this kid was wasting me too.  He's just laughing at me.  Call of duty?  Calling my mother a cunt.  And I was just getting angry.  I'm like,  my mother's not a cunt.  You cunt.  Huh?  Never mind.  All right.  You know what, though?  All right, let's bring the finalists in.  Let's bring them all in.  Let's have a big hand for a... 
[02:51:00]  I thought Paul got cut off.  I argue with them sometimes.  No, they got to come in.  They say no when I say yes.  Shut up, boss.  I know, but he's trying to fucking talk.  You're trampling everybody, horse teeth.  I can't say nothing without you trampling it.  Now don't look at me expectantly.  That stupid look on your face.  It's the only one he's got.  Exactly.  Eat an apple out of my palm. 
[02:51:30]  That's what he was saying to the waiter last night.  Yeah, yeah.  I used to fuck him when he was a baby.  Yeah, I'd put my hands on your tummy  and you'd yell,  my ribs, my ribs.  It's so uncomfortable.  Creepy. 
[02:52:00]  Very creepy.  Look at this fucking lineup.  Yeah, there you go.  The black guy did it.  That's him.  That's him.  Depends on what the crime is, really.  Yes.  If a child has been molested,  it's the guy in the red.  Yeah.  If there was a gay store robbed,  it's the guy in the fucking red, too.  Oops.  I just barely got that out.  If someone took the outfit off  Rodney Dangerfield's corpse,  it's the guy on the end.  Yeah.  Or if a buffet was molested. 
[02:52:30]  How many times are you going to use that line?  I haven't used that in at least a year.  In fucking eight minutes.  Shut up.  I didn't say molest.  Shut up.  Buffet molester.  All right.  Do it again.  Do it in one of your characters.  Anyhow, folks.  All right.  How's this one?  Or I'll do it in this,  but you need the chip of loss.  It's up to you to decide.  I like that one.  I'm dodging it.  What are you,  molest buffets or something?  Oh, shit. 
[02:53:00]  All right.  I got a dryer door.  How long has it been  since you did those jokes?  The dryer door I still do,  but it's a washing machine door.  Why?  Not dryer.  Dryer's kind of...  Yeah, you can say it better.  You can say it better.  A dryer door is funnier  than washing machine...  Really?  Why don't you just do  a revolving door at the airport?  Dryer door is funnier.  Okay.  I'll do...  What was that?  That wasn't me. 
[02:53:30]  I scraped.  I scraped against my little...  All right.  Oh, God love you.  I thought you would...  We want to do the fart mask  before you.  I know.  I don't have anything going...  The minute you put me on the spot,  my fucking eight is just clenched up.  Maybe someone out there.  Would you take a fart  from a listener?  Fat guy's got one.  You got one?  Bobby, fat guy's got one.  Which fat guy's got one?  Wait a minute.  Which fat guy?  The guy that's in the contest.  Oh, all right.  Well, there's two of them.  Put that on your face.  This is our fart mask.  I've never seen this.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  Don't do anything.  It's hilarious. 
[02:54:00]  Bobby might puke.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold it in.  Hold it in.  Hold on.  Hold it.  Bob, put the mask on.  It's very hard to keep it  right at the exit.  Oh, oh, oh.  Bob, put the mask on.  Hold it on.  Put the mask on.  Keep it on.  I'm not going to, you cunt.  It was silent, but...  Now, breathe it deep.  Leave it there.  Leave it there.  Breathe deep.  Now, breathe deep in your nose.  Deep through the nose. 
[02:54:30]  I love my fucking ribs.  I love my fucking ribs.  That was so fucking interesting.  That's what I said.  It's just, it's almost like drinking a fine wine or a cigar. 
[02:55:00]  You can smell the different fusions of a fart.  That was kind of nutty with a chocolate hint of chocolate and like old pizza.  It's pink berry and whiskey.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  I want one of those.  It really does make a fart much more interesting.  It's fucking crazy.  Holy shit.  That was funny.  Satan hit in the corner.  Do you not like vomit?  You can't handle people puking? 
[02:55:30]  Hell no, right?  That just freaked me the fuck out.  That's all it is.  And then he started throwing up.  It just got really sad.  I was like, I'm seriously, my father's beating my mother all of a sudden.  I just want to go in the corner.  White guy's crazy.  Hey, you were good in DC camp.  Oh.  Oh, buddy.  That was good.  Of course it was good.  It was a good Charlie Barnett reference.  These kids don't know who he is.  These kids.  These kids.  Mike.  All right, Rich, let's do this.  First of all, let's have a big hand for everybody.  Of course. 
[02:56:00]  Rich, knock the guys out.  Unfortunately, we can't keep all four.  Two of you have to leave, and you probably know who you are.  Oh, shit.  Okay, so far.  Okay, here's what I think.  We should ask, if you think you're not making it, raise your hand.  Wow.  They are all confident.  All very confident.  Two of you are in denial.  Two of you have shitty instincts.  Oh, damn. 
[02:56:30]  That's brutal.  You're delusional.  It really wasn't.  No, they were all good.  That much, no one stood out badly.  Yeah, no one bombed.  It's like, it was not easy.  There were two we thought were a little more obvious.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two, you guys were all funny.  Definitely better than the cab drivers that came in earlier.  Okay, first of all, Seat Smith, come forward.  You didn't make it.  What the fuck are you laughing at?  No, seriously.  Bill Squire, come forward. 
[02:57:00]  Okay.  Now, the two that made it can't see the two that are behind him.  And is every good cop buddy movie.  Mark and Ramon, you guys were great.  And everybody can't win.  One of these fucks is leaving too.  But you two are leaving before him.  But you guys did great jobs. 
[02:57:30]  You really did.  So we got our finalists.  So, yeah, Ramon, enjoy that long ride back to Cleveland.  Are you driving with him?  No, I'm staying for a couple days and hanging out in the city and then going back.  All right.  Can I plug my Twitter real quick?  No, you lost.  Go.  At Ramon Rivas, aye, aye.  Thank you.  Ramon Rivas, aye.  Good job, both of you guys.  You did good, man.  Absolutely.  That fucking Prince William Mass joke was hell.  That is funny.  That was probably my favorite joke of the night. 
[02:58:00]  There was a bunch of good ones.  But that Prince William Mass joke was fucking great.  Can we just look at him?  He's bummed now.  You should have said that to his face.  Can we just look at him?  Hey, bring it.  All right, guys.  Get ready for WowWare.  WowWare coming up on Little Miss Perfect.  Now you guys have to do it.  No one watches that except me.  Exactly.  Wow.  You're the only one that takes a Cialis and watches that show.  I don't need Cialis when I watch that show.  That's true.  You need Salt Peter.  Sometimes they look so perfect. 
[02:58:30]  What, are they going to do a half an hour each now?  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.  How the hell are we doing now?  Do they do more time?  What do they do?  Whatever gets us to 10.  Two more minutes from each guy, I believe.  Which guy's going to go first?  You want to do rock, paper, scissor?  Flip a coin or the superior race will pick.  Oh, shit.  You can't say you're part of the superior race if you can't say the word superior.  What's a superior race?  Flip a coin and make sure the black guy doesn't steal it. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, Bobby.  Oh, really?  I think Bill should call.  Okay, let's do this.  In the air.  Whenever you're ready.  There.  Jesus.  It is tails, my friend.  Let's go second.  Oh, he wants the headline.  Oh, he's going to follow up.  Look at that.  Wow, good call, you fucking schemer.  All right.  This is Seton.  Can we introduce?  Wait, let's introduce him again.  Yeah, come back in the room, dude.  Step up and go over there and we'll introduce you again. 
[02:59:30]  Rich will introduce you.  All right.  Folks, we are now down to our finals.  Are you ready for our final two acts?  This next guy was amazing in the semifinals.  Let's have a big hand for Seton Smith.  Song.  I got to make an apology right now because I use the N-word way too fucking much.  I use it a lot. 
[03:00:00]  Do you remember when you were kids and your parents were around and you used to curse  yourself a little bit because you knew it was wrong?  You'd be like, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, right?  Every time, I swear to God, I went in my car.  I get a loan.  I know it's wrong.  I look around.  I'm like, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga.  It's so bad.  It sounds like a clam meeting in my car.  I took it to a higher, more immature level.  Do y'all remember this game called Zelda?  Yeah?  Do you remember the beginning of Zelda where you could name your own character?  Well, I named my character, nigga, right?  Which was hilarious to me because now wherever I go in this magical, mystical world where there's 
[03:00:30]  talking dragons, talking elves, and talking trees, somebody's calling me a nigga.  And that is funny to me, all right?  Right?  I walk into a dungeon and an elf will fly out on the floor like, nigga!  Take this master sword!  And I'm like, no.  I ain't taking no master sword.  There's a Zelda plantation around here right now.  I'm going to be picking magic cotton.  Fuck out of here, right?  All right.  One more joke.  Here we go.  I'm going to say this. 
[03:01:00]  I don't want to do another black joke.  Well, fuck it.  Here we go.  I'm ignorant.  I was watching the Spelling Bee.  Anybody seen the Spelling Bee before?  It's amazing.  If you ever watch it, it's amazing.  I think, though, it's too easy.  We can make it harder.  Here we go.  We have the same Spelling Bee, but we have the advanced round.  And we call it the black Spelling Bee, okay?  Where they have to spell black kids' names.  You know how scared that child will be when I say that first word?  And for your first word, Yarnakisha.  Fuck.  Can you use that word in a sentence, please? 
[03:01:30]  Yarnakisha, you better bring your black ass in this house.  Yarnakisha.  Before I take the black off your ass, Yarnakisha.  Okay.  Can you tell me the root of the word?  Maybe the country of origin?  The country of origin?  Oh, shit.  Here we go.  Country of origin.  The Rhythm Nation.  That's the best I can do.  The Rhythm Nation.  That's Janet Jackson's best album, I think, you know, before the titty. 
[03:02:00]  All right.  Here we go.  So, I'm going to try to spell it.  Y-H-A-R capital N underscore parentheses at yahoo.com.  You are correct.  Fuck.  That was funny.  All right.  That's two minutes?  That's it.  Good job. 
[03:02:30]  Why are you looking at me expectantly?  Rich, you've been to the host the whole time.  Which one were you?  If somebody holds a mic to their mouth, I think they're going to say something.  It's like a cock.  How about this?  Die.  I thought you guys were going to say something.  No, we're going to wait until they're all done.  We don't want to, like, fucking sway anyone.  Introduce him, you jackass.  Okay.  Fuck off.  Fuck off.  What?  I don't know.  Let's have a big hand.  Bill Squire, folks.  All right. 
[03:03:00]  Thank you again.  Thank you.  I'm married, and I like being married because I don't have to worry about ladies anymore.  Not that it was ever really a problem.  But it's nice because they just do things that drive me crazy.  Like, ladies, I'm tired of you thinking just because a guy is talking to you that he's hitting on you.  It's like, I'm a nice guy.  I like to talk to people.  And after a show a few weeks ago, I got these two ladies.  I'm like, hey, what's up?  And they're like, married and married.  And I was like, rapist.  So it doesn't matter. 
[03:03:30]  It's going to happen.  What kind of car do you drive?  Just kidding.  I already know.  Have you ever wanted to punch someone in the face really bad?  Yeah, but you can't.  Is there a child?  I actually have a wife, and she has three kids from a previous marriage, and that's why I wrote that joke.  And they say things that you can never be ready for.  Like, the other day we're driving around, and from the back seat, I hear one of the girls yell, 
[03:04:00]  Jay keeps digging in her winky.  I can't unhear that.  That's in my brain forever.  And there's so many things wrong with that statement.  Because first of all, she called her out by name.  She didn't want there to be any confusion as to who the culprit was.  Second, she said keeps.  Meaning she gave her a couple chances to get it out of her system, followed by digging in, not around or amongst,  her winky, which I guess is what they call a vagina.  I don't know why.  Perhaps because it looks like a single eye closed turned sideways. 
[03:04:30]  Just my hunch based on the visual, right?  Then my favorite part of this whole exchange is she wasn't even embarrassed or ashamed.  She was just like, only sometimes.  And, uh, I, uh, like, three girls, right?  And I think it's easier to raise boys than just to raise girls.  Because boys are going to do dumb shit, no matter how good a parent you are.  Like, I had amazing parents.  But I still stuck my dick in a vacuum cleaner once.  And if you ever do that, use the hoe. 
[03:05:00]  It's not the spinny part.  It is.  Just a little tip.  It is now.  There you go.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Wow.  Skip competition.  I don't like that the black guy's like, I think you got it, man.  I think he's trying to psych himself out.  Aw, shit.  You don't know, dude.  Well, yeah.  You don't know?  It's so hard to fucking, you know, judge.  Speak?  Because, because, because, because, because, because, because, because, because Norton is 
[03:05:30]  all over you.  Why is this turning to a Rick Boss?  Oh, man.  No, because they're both, they're both fucking tens.  They're two different styles.  But they both had tens.  You know what I mean?  So it's hard.  It's up to the, uh, to the host.  You're not the judges.  You're not the judges.  You're not the judges.  You're not the judges.  I will say this.  I say this.  I'm not a judge anymore.  I'm the host.  They both did really well.  Seaton, your last joke didn't get what you wanted at the very end of it.  Um, it's a good joke, though, but it just, it, I think the ending of it probably should 
[03:06:00]  be tightened a little bit.  And, uh, the, the only criticism I have was that you, you did a lot of just black material.  And it's like, as a comic, I know not, I, it's tough in two minutes in an all white  crowd, but, you know, these other things you talk about as a comedian, too.  Um, but that's, it's, you know, I'm not saying it wasn't funny.  It was funny.  It was good.  Uh, my personal thing is I would have said what country, is that country of origin?  I probably would have said Detroit, but, you know, we're named a city.  That's pretty funny.  We had named a city in Baltimore, but, uh, it was still a good set. 
[03:06:30]  Uh, my, I felt that Bill, your set was stronger.  Um, at the end, I felt it was more consistent all the way through.  I hate to word it like that, but Seaton was very funny.  Yeah.  Giant reservoir dog suit.  I thought you were really good.  Yes.  Yeah.  Reservoir elephants.  I thought, uh, yeah, he had a stronger set.  Um, again, the black stuff.  I love hearing nigger anytime.  So I liked, I enjoyed that.  I feel like there's a crowd for it.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Normally I do relationship shit if I'm doing Montreal. 
[03:07:00]  I know.  But here it's like, yeah, you know, niggas.  And I'm like, yeah, I yell that out in my car too.  Yeah.  Like, yeah.  Yeah.  In your driveway alone.  This is literally open Anthony fucking demographic.  You know what I'm talking about?  But the spelling bee joke, the spelling bee joke is really good.  It's not predictable.  You don't see where it's going.  I mean, it's such a funny joke.  I got relationship.  I got fucking jokes.  Well, you should have done them too late.  I know.  I fucked up.  I fucked up.  Yeah, you did.  Now learn from it.  Shut up.  I'm shutting up.  I'm kidding.  No, dude, you did great.  I agree with, I mean, the one good thing that Bill did is he came in with fat jokes 
[03:07:30]  and then he went to something else on the second half.  Yeah.  And that's what you should.  Which is fantastic.  I love fat David Letterman.  I think you did good, man.  I think you both did really good.  But I think, Bill, you came in, you switched it up a little bit.  And you did a bunch of different jokes that were funny too.  Original.  I never heard that shit before.  And I got some good fat jokes.  And, yeah.  And you got, you know me.  You saw me five years ago when I opened you for the Cleveland Improv and I calmed down 
[03:08:00]  an early beard.  I know.  You know, you're not a lot better.  I mean, you're kind of the same.  But as far as this competition goes, you did good.  But you both were funny.  You're very, that, that, that spelling bee joke was hilarious, you know.  Oh, thank you.  They're both, both star quality.  I mean, they both.  Oh, shut up.  I'm trying to be nuts.  Bobby's doing just fine.  Can you get Bobby back in the Improv?  Can you get Bobby?  Probably easier to get Seton in there.  It's pretty black over there. 
[03:08:30]  I mean, if you.  It is.  It is.  No, no.  By getting Bobby in the Improv, he meant you butted the doors.  Sorry, Bob.  I was implying you're heavy.  They got a freight entrance.  I don't think that's heavy.  Yeah.  The one you use.  I don't think that's heavy.  I think we're giving it to Bill, huh?  Yeah, I think so.  Sounds like.  I don't know.  Yeah, I agree with what you guys.  What did the crowd think?  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Well, you want to do that?  All you guys who thought Bill was the one. 
[03:09:00]  Bill?  And, wait a minute, black guy?  No, even the black guy didn't vote for you.  And the one guy that likes Seton.  I think we've got to give it to Bill.  We have to give it to Bill.  I think Bill has won Car Crash Comedy today, man.  Bill!  Squire.  Brought to you by the Borgata Hotel, Casino, and Spa.  Visit theborgata.com.  What did he win?  Do we even know? 
[03:09:30]  Nothing.  What did he win, Travis?  Bill wins $2,000.  Holy fuck.  No, he doesn't.  Yes, he does.  No shit.  Give it to the black guy.  He'll get it on the way out.  I'd love to go outside and see Fatso stabbed in the gut.  And by Fatso, you mean yourself.  I'm sorry, Bob.  I didn't mean that.  Oh, damn.  $2,000.  That's nice. 
[03:10:00]  $2,000 and the chance to appear on the show.  He's on stage at the Borgata.  With who?  With who?  With who?  With the wonderful Borgata.  To be determined.  They have a regular show there all the time.  That means it's never going to happen.  Oh, shit.  Best hotel in Atlantic City.  You'll like it there, Matt.  Why don't we talk to Seton for a second?  You can plug Seton on Twitter and whatever else.  Yeah.  Just follow Seton Smith Twitter.  My website, SetonSmith.com.  And Facebook, Seton Smith.  And check my fucking Funny or Die.  I got some great videos.  Check that shit out, please.  And we know what your name is on Warcraft, right? 
[03:10:30]  Yes, exactly.  All right, cool.  Really funny, brother.  Bill, thank you.  Good job, man.  And Bill, the winner of Car Crash Comedy.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Congratulations.  Say whatever you want, brother.  What was that?  What are you going to do with the $2,000?  Oh, yeah.  What do you think he's going to do?  I'll probably go to what one.  I was going to say.  He's going to make one trip to weddings.  Y'all spent $1,971.  Oh, Chip.  Fucking Chip. 
[03:11:00]  Fucking Chip.  Love when Bobby says that.  And he, really.  I don't know.  I'll just probably hang on to it because it's, you know, this business, Feast or Famine.  And that was it.  You know what side you fall off?  I like to set myself up.  I won now.  I don't have to be funny anymore.  Re-count.  I'm having a try.  I don't know.  Maybe I'll throw a show.  Have Voss come out and feature for me.  Yeah.  Oh, wow. 
[03:11:30]  The only way you could follow me is if we were going downhill.  Where are we going?  Come on.  Where are we going?  You should have said uphill because you would get uphill first before the fact.  You guys, downhill, he'd roll in front of you.  Okay.  Rich is just defeated.  You said 100% the wrong thing.  No, I said the only way he could follow me is if you keep up with me is going downhill.  No, you said follow you. 
[03:12:00]  But if he was going downhill, he's fat.  He'd roll ahead of you.  Going uphill, you'd be first.  I'm quick going downhill.  How quick do you know I am?  Nah, forget it.  I go downhill.  Fuck.  Exactly.  Look at my career.  So are you going to grow sheeting like a couple hundred, you know, for a fucking-  Fuck no.  Oh.  What about your wife?  Your wife has kids from another marriage.  Right, yeah.  Are they going to see any of that money?  Yeah, they'll probably actually see most of it.  I don't really, you know.  You're going to have to pay for it.  I treat them like my own kids.  I'm a good guy like that. 
[03:12:30]  I'm a sweet boy.  Oh.  Yeah, look at this.  Get out.  Look at this.  I know.  I lost all the fans I just made.  You look like a fucking big lollipop sucker.  Wow.  Is that Billy the Bassman?  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Now it's funny.  I was hoping you would do some Billy the Bassman today.  I don't know if people want to see him.  We could finish up with Billy the Bassman.  You got anything?  Of course it's Billy the Bassman, but he's going to be introduced. 
[03:13:00]  Why don't you leave and come back in?  No.  Will you stop fucking shaking your iPhone because you have that feature?  We all hate watching you do that.  What is it?  What's the feature?  He's got to shake the shuffle thing on his iPhone so he does that and it moves.  You don't even know what I'm doing.  Yes, I do.  I'm actually doing something on my iPhone.  I hope it's writing a suicide note.  You can't give Jim more than 30 seconds.  No, no, no.  Exactly.  You're going to fucking have something.  I had nothing to do.  You're either fat.  You're killing yourself. 
[03:13:30]  You're a dumb Jew.  Dying of AIDS.  You're slipping in AIDS.  You guys want to ask his t-shirt?  Hey, why don't we all...  No, no.  I want to ask these guys if they want to see Billy the Bassman for a minute.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  How y'all doing out there?  Billy the Bassman.  Woo!  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Come on.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  I'll tell you where we're going.  We're going to Funnyville right now. 
[03:14:00]  Let me tell you something here.  Let me tell you something now.  That was a good comedy show from those two young snipper snappers.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Never hit a man with glasses.  Hit him with a baseball bat.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  I'll tell you where we're going to the next joke, you little cocksucker.  How is it?  One careless match can start a forest fire, but it takes a whole box to start a campfire. 
[03:14:30]  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Where are we going is right, goddamn where we're going.  I'll tell you where we're going.  Go right to this fucking joke right here.  When you go into a court, you are pointing your fate into the hands of another man.  And he just ripped the iPhone out of Bobby's head.  That's how it is right now.  With all the jokes.  That doesn't matter, because I got fucking jokes.  You know about the man that got his left arm and left leg ripped off? 
[03:15:00]  He was all right.  There we go.  Bobby the bad man.  That's all I got.  Billy the bad man.  I got one more, you guys.  I'll tell you this.  I actually bought a washing machine door.  Where are we going?  Billy the bad man, everyone.  Billy the bad man.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's start our weekend, huh?  Yes.  Jimmy, where are you going to be, brother?  I'll be at the Montclair Wellmont Theater, Saturday night only. 
[03:15:30]  And then next week, Cobb's San Francisco.  Voss will be at the Stress Factory tonight and tomorrow.  And then next week, where?  The Arlington Cinema Draft House in Arlington, Virginia.  All right.  And Bobby will be at Uncle Vinny's in Point Pleasant.  Tonight, Bob, or just tomorrow?  Tonight, Uncle Vinny's, 8 o'clock show, Point Pleasant.  Tomorrow night, Uncle Vinny's in Staten Island.  And you guys have any gigs coming up, Seton or Bill?  The winner of Car Crash Comedy.  Bill, go ahead.  And next week, I'll be at the Richmond, Virginia Funny Bone with Biff from Back to the Future. 
[03:16:00]  Boo.  Oh, wow.  He's actually funny.  I'm doing a bunch of colleges now, so if I can go back to them.  You won't see any of these people.  Not at all.  If I can plug my Twitter, Bill underscore Squire on Twitter.  Okay.  Oh, and next week, Bonnie is also on a special appearance by Bonnie, who doesn't go on the  road anymore, so it's two headliners next week.  What?  Who's she bringing?  You're acting like she made a career choice.  She has a baby.  Exactly.  Let's go home.
