<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie detailing his illness, blaming a sudden weather change and a jacuzzi pump malfunction.  This segued into a humorous, medically inaccurate discussion about colds,  stress, and wet hair.  Opie then launched into a stressed-out rant about his upcoming wedding, his disorganized planning (lack of honeymoon plans, tuxedo rental, and finalized guest list), and his ineffective wedding planner.  This led to a discussion about his past use of amphetamines and a tangential conversation about his dating history and racial preferences. The first half concluded with a discussion about classic rock bands continuing to use their names despite significant lineup changes (Led Zeppelin, Alice in Chains, Black Sabbath, Van Halen, Boston, Guns N' Roses), featuring a humorous Van Halen reunion song parody and Sam Roberts' "Primetime Gossip" segment teasing the departure of a show employee, Roland, a "soft-spoken, psychotic talent booker," who allegedly became homeless shortly after.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about Alice in Chains' "Unplugged" album,  with frequent guest Jim Norton in studio promoting his book, "I Hate Your Guts."  Their conversation included comedic banter about the book's cover and its fictional anti-Christian bias storyline.  Political discussion followed, covering Obama's campaign, Biden's tax comments, and a judge's ruling on homeless voter registration.  An alleged unreleased sex tape involving Obama and a PLO figure was also mentioned.  A significant portion featured "Jocktober," showcasing awful radio commercials from various cities (Calgary, Fargo, Houston, Los Angeles), including a self-deprecating show commercial and a bondage-themed "traffic master" ad.  A comedic bit with Big A, an overweight caller with a speech impediment, describing a Studebaker stampede, was also included.  The show promoted its pole-dancing contest ($1000 prize) and featured an interview with Tracy Lords from "Zach and Miri Make a Porno." The segment ended with discussion of the "hot wax incident" involving E-Rock and intern David's upset over the use of Jewish "yard sale candles."

The "yard site" (Yahrzeit) candle discussion continued, featuring playful ribbing of intern David and discussions of his kibbutz experience in Israel and his staff funny-list ranking (including Jimmy Norton, Club Soda Kenny, Anthony Cumia, Opie, Sam Roberts, and others).  Tracy Lords called in again, discussing "Zach and Miri Make a Porno" and the upcoming pole-dancing contest.  The segment contained numerous off-color jokes and vulgar language.  Chris Jericho was mentioned as being in studio.

The next segment featured Tracy Lords promoting "Zach and Miri Make a Porno," discussing its comedic nature and societal reactions to its content, sharing anecdotes from filming, and discussing her past career in pornography, including her underage work and its legal aftermath.  The hosts and Lords created fictional pornographic names for themselves.  Chris Jericho then joined, promoting his Fuse TV show, "Redemption Song," discussing his musical career and MTV censorship.  The segment concluded with Anthony Cumia's expletive-laden rant about a negative encounter with Gene Simmons, including accusations of harassment and sexually explicit speculation about Simmons' sexual performance.

The final segment started with Chris Jericho discussing his preferences for women, his appearances on *Monday Night Raw*, and *Redemption Song*.  The conversation included his relationship with Gene Simmons, favorite metal songs (Iron Maiden and Metallica), a Led Zeppelin tour debate, and the UFC (Brock Lesnar). A band submitted a song for critique, followed by a call from pornographic film actress Katie Morgan.  Their conversation covered her career, specific actors she'd worked with, her role in *Zach and Miri Make a Porno*, and performance-enhancing drug use in the porn industry, featuring highly sexually charged interactions.  Discussion continued about pornographic film producer Max Hardcore and his legal troubles, focusing on obscenity charges and free speech. Listener calls, some highly offensive, were read, followed by the "Line of the Day" segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Woke up feeling like crap today.  Maybe it's the weather change.  Maybe it's not supposed to go from, I don't know, 70 and sunny to snowy and upper 30s.  It always does that.  And then what, Friday's going to be nice again here in New York?  Yeah.  I feel better now, though. 
[00:00:30]  A little better.  I think I got the X.  The change of weather X.  What makes all that the blahs?  The blahs.  Back in the old days.  Just the weather change, man.  Yesterday, it was raining here in New York.  No umbrella, just walking around getting just completely soaked.  It was so windy and cold and raining yesterday.  Yeah.  And I get home and realize that one of the pumps weren't plugged in over my cover on my jacuzzi. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  And the water was building up in it and starting to, like, have the cover pushed down.  And I'm out in the rain.  It's pouring rain.  The wind.  And I'm trying to hook the pump up.  I felt like I was on the Titanic trying to, like, fix something.  Yeah, just like the Titanic.  Yes, exactly like it.  How many dead bodies you got in your yard.  Oh, well.  Shallow graves here and there.  Yeah, but I don't think you're supposed to be.  At least one in the fire pit.  So, I know that. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, well.  That will never change.  Yeah, I don't think you're supposed to be walking around with wet hair when it's, like, low 40s, high 30s.  I don't think that makes a difference.  I think it does.  I honestly don't think that makes a difference.  Then why don't you get sick when it's summertime and you're just enjoying a little rain shower and you're walking around.  And you're like, ah, I don't care if I get wet because it's, like, 80, 85 degrees out.  I don't know.  I think it's coincidence that you just get sick.  Because how many people go out and get wet and don't get sick? 
[00:02:00]  Like, why would your hair getting wet in the cold get you sick?  I think it knocks down your temperature of your body and your body goes, whoa, hey.  And then you get sick for a day or so.  Whoa, hey?  Yeah, you get a whoa, hey.  And then, like, in a day, day and a half, you're better.  It's not like I have the flu.  I just feel like crap today, and I think it's because I was walking around in the cold rain yesterday.  Could be that your body goes, the only thing, because it technically doesn't matter, but it could be, A, in winter, everybody's more indoors, so we're breathing on each other.  Yeah, that's true. 
[00:02:30]  But if your hair is wet and your body is chilly, the things that, like, the parts, little blood cells that go to warm your body are warming you instead of protecting you from germs.  So maybe that's how you get more sick in winter.  Your immune system is busy warming you.  I think it gets knocked down just a little bit.  I don't know.  Maybe in the year 2008 we should be able to figure this stuff out.  What do I know?  Your immunity is pained in your white blood cells.  Right.  Which are part of the lymphatic system.  Sure.  And the red blood cells, I do believe, do more of keeping you warm. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  With, you know, you're dilating blood vessels.  Uh-huh.  And then contracting blood vessels on the extremities.  So I'm just sick.  I think you're just sick.  Eight, seven, seven, two, one, two.  Oh, and I woke up this morning.  I'm like, no way can I come in today.  But it's weird.  An hour goes by and I feel definitely, you know, better. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  I'll be all right.  What was wrong?  Just a nose.  Sore throat.  Really sore throat.  Scratchy throat.  Scratchy sore throat.  Body aches.  Did your butt hurt?  My butt hurts.  No, no, no hurting butt.  I'm going to hire one of those visiting nurse services for you.  You could just come in.  Oh, my God.  But I'm running around like a lunatic.  I got a lot to do between now and the end of the year.  And I put that on it more than anything else. 
[00:04:00]  Of course.  The stresses that go along with planning and being part of a big event  will ravage your immune system quicker than...  Both of us are...  Cold or...  Both of us are coming down with illnesses we've never had before.  Real?  Uh-oh.  No, not yet.  Oh, oh.  They're all like stress-related without getting into it.  Just ridiculous.  I told you about the hives and just...  You just wake up with a rash.  Yeah, just like...  What is this?  How do nerves and stress do this? 
[00:04:30]  It's the strangest thing.  But I've got all my blood work done.  I'm fine.  Wake up one day, you got half a Hulk face.  Yeah.  You're like, what is this?  The nerves?  I gotta go do the nerves.  Bell's palsy.  What happened?  I was paranoid enough to get all my blood work again and some detailed tests.  And I'm like, I am as healthy as an ox.  But I don't feel it.  Because like you said, all of a sudden it'll be a rash one day, a hive here, sore throat today.  It's just all stress-related. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Absolutely.  We're getting there.  We just, as people, want to jump up and down and scream, I'm scared, but we can't do that.  So our body, we hold it all in and our body pushes it out in other ways.  I've never prepared more for anything in my life.  It's ridiculous.  That's, I guess, how it should be.  It's completely ridiculous.  And I'm lucky enough to have someone that could, you know, help plan the wedding.  And she's a waste. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, wow.  The wedding planner?  She's a waste.  I'm like, I thought we hired you so I wouldn't be hiving out and having all these stress illnesses  and sore throats and stuff.  I still have way too much to do.  Greg Hughes stars in The Wedding Planner 2.  Yeah, no kidding.  That's true.  Oh, that's scratching.  What a waste.  You think, you know, you're lucky enough to, like, hire someone to do everything for you? 
[00:06:00]  You think, okay, I just got to show up, right?  Hell no.  No, huh?  Why am I doing all this stuff if I hired you?  Do you have to pick things out?  Yeah.  Do you have to pick out things like centerpieces?  No.  Hell no.  Flowers?  Hell the F no.  That's not your gig?  No, they're doing that stuff.  All right.  Just name one of your responsibilities as going into this.  What's, like, something that you had to really delve into?  Planning the honeymoon.  Oh, okay.  That's like a vacation, though, right? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, and I still don't have a place to go.  This is exactly what you do for vacations.  You don't know where you're going on your honeymoon?  Dude, this is year after year that we've always gone on vacation.  It's like, oh, where are you going?  It's like, I got my vacation planned 10 months in advance, and it's like, where are you going,  Ope?  I don't know.  How about just hop on a plane and see which way the runway points?  I'm the worst, man.  I don't know.  I do not know.  Well, because I've been lucky enough to go to a lot of really cool places the last five 
[00:07:00]  or six years, and, you know, for a honeymoon, you want something special.  I want to go over to, like, you know, Europe or something, but it's a horrible time.  Yeah, we know Ope.  He's going to be packing in his tuxedo.  He's still going to be packing for his honeymoon.  Dude, you've got to figure out where, though.  I know I do.  You don't think I'm panicking?  Why do you think I'm sick today?  I'm panicking about it.  Don't you think I know that?  How about San Francisco?  It doesn't have to be a person.  Why San Francisco?  It's a great city.  It is a great city.  Let them see what a hetero couple looks like. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Great food.  Why not?  Everybody minds his business.  Some lofts.  Yeah.  They'll go up to your chick and just be like, wow, who did your work?  You look fantastic.  No, I'm a girl.  Boo.  Boo.  Ah, boo.  Everyone's saying Hawaii, but I don't feel like being on a plane for 12 effing hours with  a stopover.  That's a typical honeymoon.  I have no desire to do a 12-hour.  And then, I can't say, but a place I've been to a few times. 
[00:08:00]  That I like a lot is one of the top honeymoon destinations in the world.  Cambodia?  Thailand?  But I do that on a regular vacation.  So, you know, I don't know what to do.  And I don't know where this comes from.  I know when I was in school, I was last minute guy.  Like, I would cram for tests.  I would pop those black beauties, go old school.  Oh, geez.  And they would keep you up all night.  You were popping black beauties?  I thought you said you were never with them. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, man.  I want to be.  Oh.  I want to be so bad.  You mean the drug.  I don't think it's really cheating if I'm with a black girl, right?  Really?  Yeah.  You might want to talk that over with the fiancé.  That's my logic.  It'd be great to see you.  Fast forward five years, having a conversation with a lawyer.  I think it'd be because of the racial differential.  Right.  Even have it on tape.  Oh, boy, did I want a black beauty.  Wow.  Did you really?  Came close a few times, yeah.  But anyway, yeah, so I'm a last minute guy. 
[00:09:00]  Always have been.  I can't function unless, like, the pressure's on.  Yeah.  But then you start getting rashes and colds.  Dude, I don't even know where I'm getting tuxedos yet.  Oh, my God.  People know this months out, at least.  I just started looking at wedding bands only yesterday.  That's why I'm sick, because I was running around in the ring.  Like the ring ones or the ones that play at a wedding?  Oh, no, no.  I'm serious.  No, see, because that's, like, that's the wedding planner.  All the stuff she's responsible for. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's for the party.  Months in advance.  She's planning, like, the whole thing and the party and everything like that.  How about this one?  I'm still handing in names of people to invite.  Oh, God.  You are the worst.  How do you not have a...  My mom...  I talked to my mom yesterday.  Oh, you're terrible.  My mom just gave me her list.  And I go, ah, don't worry about it.  Most people just got their invitations in the mail this week anyway, so...  It is astounding. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Trust me.  It's close enough that you shouldn't still be handing in names of people you want to invite.  This isn't inviting a few people over for the Super Bowl.  Right.  How about this?  There's still someone I want to ask to be in the wedding party.  I haven't done that here.  What are you going to ask them?  There?  Hey, why don't you stand up?  Are you here?  Yeah.  Come on up here.  I've always been like this, though.  You know, we've told the stories when we go on vacation and Kenny comes over and drives 
[00:10:30]  me to the airport, which is a really nice little luxury to have.  Of course.  He sits downstairs in the car as I'm running around my apartment at 4, 4.30 in the morning  packing.  Oh, yeah.  You're still packing.  I refuse to pack the night before.  I don't know why.  And I have tried.  I put the suitcase out.  I start, like, at least piling up the underwear and the socks, because that's easy.  You just count the days and add a couple just in case you have a problem or something.  And then, that's an easy one. 
[00:11:00]  But then, like, I start looking at all my shirts, and I'm like, but I like all these  shirts.  I've left a few soldiers behind.  Sure.  At the old hotel room.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  Sorry, old fruit of the loom.  You ain't making it back.  Had a rough night last night.  The sad part is I got crappy clothes, but when I go on vacation, I want all my crappy clothes.  I'm like, but I like that shirt.  I can't keep, I can't leave that one behind.  Dude, you do.  So then my head starts exploding, because I got to try to figure out what, what, what,  what to take on vacation.  That's kind of chick logic, though.  I understand.  Like, they all do that, where it's like, they bring three suitcases when they all need 
[00:11:30]  one, because they bring 20 things they're never even going to wear.  And the stupid thing is, though, when I finally get on vacation, I end up wearing three things.  Yeah.  So, one pair of pants the whole time, a bathing suit, and a dress shirt.  Yep.  That's it.  To go out at night.  That's it.  You got to make yourself do it.  Like, for me, flying was the scary part.  Like, I couldn't do it.  Yeah.  I made my, I had to.  It was a necessity.  You're going to have to make yourself, like, pack, and then the next morning, go, whatever's  in there is all I'm taking.  And I mean, your hair, you'll be itching, you'll be screaming. 
[00:12:00]  You got to do it.  Do not touch anything the next morning.  You make yourself do it a few times, it becomes a bit more of a habit.  But you have, you can do it if you just make yourself do it.  If I can fly, anybody can do anything.  I've gone for weekends with nothing but a carry-on.  And not a big one.  Just a carry-on, throw some clothes in, toothbrush, a razor, boom, you're off.  You don't have to sit at the baggage driver's cell.  Oh, yeah, that stuff's easy.  And things like that.  But when you're packing for, like, a 10-day vacation or something like that, then you got 
[00:12:30]  to do a little work.  But, yeah, night before is a lot easier.  No, I mean, I'm really good with going with the flow.  I can't plan in advance.  That's my biggest problem.  Like, I went on a long weekend to Lake Tahoe to do some skiing when we were off the air.  And I came home two and a half months later, and I had to kind of throw out all my winter  clothes because I ended up in L.A.  I ended up seeing Jimmy in San Francisco, then back down to L.A.  Then I went to Vegas.  You were like a pain walking the earth. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, yeah.  Then I went down to Dallas.  Then I flew back to L.A.  You know, and I had to get all, like, you know, warm climate clothes.  Yeah.  And just go with it.  And then, did I tell you the story?  I got back to Newark.  I was in long-term parking.  I was gone literally two and a half, three months.  And winter was kind of just starting when I started this adventure.  I got back to my car.  The ice on this thing was close to a foot because it was snow just, you know, building 
[00:13:30]  up, melting, building up, melting, building up, melting.  I couldn't get in my car.  Yeah.  I had to start, you know, hammering away to get into the door.  And then I sat there on the curb for close to, probably close to an hour just letting  the defrost, the attempt to, like, defrost my car.  Destroying your windshield wipers.  Oh, yeah.  I think it's good now.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So everyone's trying to help me out with a honeymoon.  I want something special.  I don't know where to go.  Special is, see, there's too much pressure because you're lucky. 
[00:14:00]  You make money.  You've gone away.  Most people's honeymoon, it's the one trip they're going to take in eight years.  Right, right.  So for them, it's everything.  I understand that.  For you, it could just be one of many nice trips you take.  It doesn't have to be the top of the heap trip.  Right.  Otherwise, you're going to go to Dubai and stay in the top of that 110-story building.  Right.  You don't need to do that.  Just go to a nice place.  Sonny Forelli, he suggests the Greek islands.  Well, see, I would love to do that, but I took an ex there, so I don't want to be like,  well, the last time I was here, let me show you what I saw last time I was here. 
[00:14:30]  Can't go to the places you went with the ex.  Hell effing no, man.  Hell effing no, man.  That's for sure.  Greece is like the most amazing thing you could ever do.  I mean, Santorini is-  Speak Greek?  No, no, no, no.  A finger everyone's holding.  I love that speak Greek.  Santorini is the most beautiful place on earth.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Without a doubt, in my mind.  It's ridiculous how- 
[00:15:00]  Did you see the Acropolis?  I sure did, Anthony.  I sure did.  That's great.  I was also in Istanbul.  See, I'm lucky.  I've been around.  Before the whole shenanigans.  Wait.  Not wait.  It was a little better in front of when you were hanging out with Muslims.  Well, just before.  Because I flew back a couple days before 9-11, my friend.  I was one of those guys, like, wow, if I would have, and I could have, maybe, because it was close enough that I could tell people it was close enough.  And I have a nice smiling picture of me and my ex at Disney World, and the date on the bottom, it's like, September 10th. 
[00:15:30]  And he's just like, hey, how you doing?  Great.  What happened the next day?  I'm not so happy.  It is weird, though.  Yeah.  Oh, and I was in Turkey.  I was in Istanbul.  I was at the Blue Mosque.  It's like the oldest mosque in the world, the one of them.  Oh, I thought it was a mosque where you had a little fun while you were there.  Well, the Shiites were walking around, which is scary crap.  Those are the hardcore Muslims. 
[00:16:00]  And I told you, I went to see, like, maybe I shouldn't say this, because now the times have changed, and now I'm scared to say this.  Well, we lined up for hours to see, like, one strand of Mohammed's beard.  Wow.  And when I finally waited my turn.  Huh?  Huh?  And I waited my turn, and they had to have, like, a big, like, magnifying glass so you could see this dumb thing.  And then I.  Saying dumb thing might have been a problem.  And then I was, like, I pretty much said this is BS.  I was really mad. 
[00:16:30]  Then I waited two hours to see one piece of hair.  What kind of glass is it behind?  Like, they're protecting this like it's Fort Knox.  You can't get that.  It's one piece of, like, hair.  And I was really mad that's all was there.  I'm just smashing it.  Huh?  I'm just smashing it and giving it a little snip with a scissor.  Oh, boy, would you be dead.  You don't have enough.  Oh, would you be just hacked apart?  You don't have enough firepower to get through that glass.  It was.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's why they had this weird magnifying glass thing.  So you can see it.  So you can see it. 
[00:17:00]  How do they know it's really his beard?  I don't know.  Yeah, how do they know?  How do we know half this crap is real or not?  Pulled it out of the sink.  And I'm not making fun of the Muslim person.  Oh, don't be scared.  I'm making fun of Jesus.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  I'm making fun of religion in general.  You make fun of everything else.  Stop already.  So.  Oh, where's the theme song?  Wow.  Hold on, Danny.  Danny in Queens, what's going on?  Nothing.  I'm all upset you guys didn't play the theme song this morning.  Yeah.  Well, stop being upset. 
[00:17:30]  Opie, I.E.  That's Opie.  With his partner, Anthony.  Hi.  They give us rules in their own views.  And Ann really doesn't hate the Jews.  No.  Little Jimmy is also there.  He likes, she knows, and no one cares.  Make me laugh, that's O-N-A.  The pendulum is swinging back the other way.  Make me laugh, make me laugh, O-N-A. 
[00:18:00]  There you go.  There's the theme song.  Until someone comes up with a better one, that's the one we use.  Now I feel good.  Yeah, so do I.  I feel all right, though.  So.  Yeah, the pressure is mounting.  I think we might bail on the wedding.  What?  We might just bail and just like elope or something.  Elope?  Yeah, that's what we should have done.  Yeah, well, I kind of did that.  Huh?  That worked out well.  Well.  I just got done with another stupid court outing.  You did? 
[00:18:30]  Well, that whole thing about, you know.  The thing?  Yeah, the thing where it was like, you know.  Did you do all right?  It was more of an accounting thing than it was a real court thing.  You know, one side sort of wanted to make sure that the other side was paying in full.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  So they went through all the paperwork and, you know, pretty much probed every part of  my orifices, my financial orifices, and found out, hey, I've been a good boy. 
[00:19:00]  And all I could say is, wow, that must have cost a pretty penny.  That must have cost a pert penny.  Were you in court yesterday?  No, no, no.  I didn't have to go.  I didn't even have to go to court.  All right, good.  My lawyer took care of everything.  Her lawyer took care of whatever, you know, crap they were doing, hiring all kinds of  accountants and things to try, pawing through my finances just to see if, you know, I was 
[00:19:30]  hiding any money or something.  I guess, you know, you get people sometimes that figure, well, I should get more, or I bet  that he's hiding something and not being honest.  And all I've done for almost nine, I would love to use the F word, years, is be honest,  forthright, and fulfilled my obligation, no matter how painful it was to do, quite honestly.  What's very painful? 
[00:20:00]  And then to have to then show that I was being honest like that, because you get somebody  involved like a Dominic Barbara type lawyer involved that, in my humble opinion, with  dealing with him over the years, I don't see him as a guy I would want to do business  with, let's put it that way.  And legal fees?  Anyways, I had to pay mine, and I didn't see anything that indicated I had to pay hers. 
[00:20:30]  So what it amounted to was, it probably cost her a lot of money to get really nothing out  of this.  To go after a little money?  And I hope it was a lesson learned as far as things go.  What is her effing problem?  Go away already.  You know, I don't know what the problem is with people.  When people get divorced, there's this thing, this clinging-like thing that I think people 
[00:21:00]  sometimes want some kind of attachment still to the other person, but it's been almost  nine years, and I really just want done with it.  I want done with it.  I don't want any more legal cases.  I don't want to go to court anymore.  I just don't want to do this.  And I hope that was kind of a lesson learned.  Like, you know, I don't know what Dominic Barber charges for legal fees, but I know it  can't be cheap.  I know the first time, because, you know, I did have to pay, just like many men have 
[00:21:30]  to do.  They've got to pay the other lawyer.  The lawyer that is screwing you, you have to then pay them, which is one of the worst  checks you'll ever write in your life.  What a scum.  You know what?  I hate that guy.  And for that to be asked this time around, too, when I had nothing to do, I was fulfilling  my obligation.  Legal fees that he asked for?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Ugh.  Didn't get them.  Good.  So now, I hope that is a little wake-up call, like, you know, just take this for what it's 
[00:22:00]  worth.  Look at it as, wow, I was able to go through quite a few years of good living based on somebody  else's employment.  And it's almost over.  I got...  In 2009, this is done.  You know, you're the only one that's going to get a huge raise in this awful economy.  Oh, I know.  Oh, I know.  You're going to be like, wow, the economy must have turned around overnight. 
[00:22:30]  My biggest fear is that after it's over, it's not going to be over.  Because I think if you take somebody and then have them on a fixed income that is pretty  good.  Pretty good?  You're being nice.  Very good.  Nice.  Very good.  That's ridiculous.  I'm just a hypothetical situation.  I know.  I'm not even talking about me.  I understand.  I'm just saying, if you have person A paying person B a lot of money, and then that money  all of a sudden is cut off, person B might want to come back to person A and try to get 
[00:23:00]  more.  Because all of a sudden, what, you got to work?  It's human nature.  You got to go out.  You got to do something now.  And you haven't had to do that for years.  That could be a problem.  You know?  Well, even though there may be things written in certain things that say that that can't  happen.  But, you know, anyone could take anyone to court is just it.  The litigation in this country is ridiculous.  So, you know, that thing.  So I got to have that over my head.  I want done with it. 
[00:23:30]  Nine years later, I want nothing to do with an ex in any way, shape, or form.  Of course.  I didn't have kids.  I didn't have any kids.  You didn't have a house.  I didn't have anything.  So why should I then have to?  You barely had a car.  Even a house.  If you have a house, that's done early on.  You either sell it and split it, or one person gets it, whatever the court decides.  Yeah, it's pretty obvious.  It's like, all right, this is the value of the house.  This is what we're doing.  Boom.  You can't get more money out of the house. 
[00:24:00]  With kids, you can't just get rid of the kid.  Although, you know, some guys do that.  They ditch their kids.  They do whatever.  But I didn't have any kids.  So why am I still having this contact with somebody I want no contact with?  I don't like this person.  So why then do I have to have contact with this person?  People I don't like, I don't deal with unless I have to.  I don't have to deal with this person.  I don't have a shared asset with this person anymore.  So I don't want to hear from her. 
[00:24:30]  But I have to for at least another few months.  But then after that's done, I don't want to hear from you anymore.  And why doesn't the court system acknowledge that this is ridiculous, that this is going on?  I don't understand why they don't take this on and realize the guys in general are getting completely screwed over.  Apparently this time.  And why are you bumming me out?  I'm getting married soon.  And I just got to do the other side.  The other side of the old teeter-totter.  But apparently the court saw it this time and said, you know, no. 
[00:25:00]  Good.  Good for you.  A small victory for Anthony.  A little small victory.  And that annoying part right now might have saved you trouble a year from now and two years from now.  Exactly.  I just hope that is kind of like a wow if I spent, let's say you got to spend $70,000 on a lawyer.  And you wind up getting nothing or next to nothing.  I'm not giving out any figures or anything.  I'm just saying, you get really what doesn't even amount to anything of that. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  You might think next time and go, wow, that was a bad investment.  You know?  It's my Citadel stock.  I wish you could give details because I bow to you.  I bow to you.  What you...  Ah, we got to stop right there.  Oh, what I told my mouthpiece?  I bow to you.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, wow.  Well, I...  Bravo, my friend.  Bravo.  I just told my lawyer, fight the good fight.  Yep.  I go, I'm not buckling this time around.  I'm not buckling.  I don't have a crap lawyer like I did for my divorce case, which I kick myself in the 
[00:26:00]  ass every time, that I didn't get, you know, Ralph Felder.  You didn't spend the money then.  Because I didn't think.  I thought it was going to be easy.  I was naive.  I thought, this will be easy.  This will be amicable.  I'll offer this.  I'll do that.  Whatever.  You know, whatever.  But it didn't turn out that way.  Her lawyer was Dominic.  He's very astute in the ways of divorce law and tactics.  Yuck.  And I wound up, you know, I didn't get the deal I would have liked to have gotten. 
[00:26:30]  So I just, after all these years, I just hope it's over.  I want it to be over.  I just, I put out an appeal to leave me the F alone.  It's funny what Obi said.  Just go away.  Just go away.  Just go away.  Yes.  Just go away.  You should be.  I was there from the beginning.  Well, not the beginning, beginning.  But, you know, I've been living this with him for a long time. 
[00:27:00]  And it's so ridiculous.  Like, people just move on.  Dude, I had to listen to stuff about my potential and what the future could hold for me.  And it was all frigging wonderful things as far as people were saying.  We didn't come close, by the way.  And right after that, I get fired.  It's like, it's like, that's what business I'm in.  I'm not in a business where I hold a medical license that has this value on it that, you know, ex-wives can go after and stuff. 
[00:27:30]  I'm in a business that the next day, and it's been proven time and time again, you can have nothing.  Nothing.  You're not making the same thing again.  And to have to listen to crap that, you know, everybody makes Howard Stern money, it just, it made me sick.  Yeah, there he is.  Look at the picture of him in his pool.  Oh, God.  I've never seen him before.  Oh, he's just a disgusting human.  Do you have more pictures of that load, Danny? 
[00:28:00]  He's a glutton.  He loves his food.  Now, now, don't personally disparage him, Opie.  That's my opinion.  I've seen him.  Oh, okay.  It doesn't look like he eats too many salads.  Let's say hi to Lonnie in North Carolina.  Lonnie.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, I know Ant remembers that special song that him and his ex danced to at his wedding.  The question is to Opie, what's going to be your special song?  Well, I haven't picked that out yet, either. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, of course you haven't.  Why would you?  Come on.  I swear to God.  The wedding's only tomorrow.  And then someone goes, have you met with the chair people yet?  What's that about that I don't know yet?  For chairs.  Before we got there, everybody had to stand at the reception.  They forgot to get chairs.  Dude, I sat in an office here in New York for close to two hours looking at fonts and paper.  Oh, my God. 
[00:29:00]  I'd go crazy.  I did go crazy because, you know, I guess for the invitation, it's got to look nice, right?  I'm like, yeah, okay.  Make it look nice.  Oh, no.  You don't understand.  Oh, you don't understand.  We have to meet with blah, blah.  All right.  How many fonts can there be?  Ten?  All right.  I can pick one out of ten.  Right?  We show up.  They had, like, little desserts and food and stuff because it was going to be a while.  And then book after book after book. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, my God.  Flipping through.  Book.  What am I showing you?  A foot high?  Over a foot.  Close to a foot.  All right.  Maybe that's an exaggeration, but barely.  Showing me flaccid.  Huh?  Yeah.  Probably less than a foot, but you get the point.  Really big, thick books.  And then page after page.  What do you think of this paper?  And you go, oh, that's nice.  All right.  Let's do that.  No, no, no, no, no.  What do you think of this one?  It's paper.  But that one feels like that. 
[00:30:00]  Well, it's not.  And then they have to explain why that paper is better than this paper.  I'm like, but to me, it's paper.  Paper.  And then I like that font right there.  Waterworld.  Yeah.  I like that font right there.  Well, there's 100 versions of that font.  Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip,  close to two hours just to do that.  And I wonder why I'm breaking out in hives and stuff.  Like, who's going to notice?  Look, you know, someone noticed if it was chicken, you know, scratch on a napkin as the invite. 
[00:30:30]  Yes.  Or who cares?  You notice things like that on some subliminal basis, but you wouldn't distinguish one nice  one from another nice one.  You just look at the invitation and go, wow, that's a nice invitation.  You don't go like, oh, that font.  Yeah.  And I don't want to confuse people.  My girl's not a bridezilla.  She gets caught up in things like I do.  Because then we're sitting there like, what are we doing?  She doesn't care either.  Just go that one, that one, that one.  Good.  Goodbye.  But no, who cared was the wedding planner.  And all of a sudden, like, my girl's looking at me, I'm looking at her, and we're like, 
[00:31:00]  what are we doing?  Justifying a paycheck.  Huh?  Justifying a paycheck.  I think that's what it was.  If you take two seconds to go that one, that one, that one, and leave, they're thinking  you might go, wow, we really don't need it.  Yeah.  Yeah, because, you know, she doesn't care what font or what weight of the paper it is.  Yeah.  Then we don't care.  So why don't we sit there for two hours?  Oh, my God.  I can't.  And I want to know what the chair people are all about. 
[00:31:30]  Chair people?  Someone said, have you met with the chair people?  That's, I guess, something.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Like a board of directors?  I'm starting to itch.  Oh, literal chairs.  I'm starting to itch.  What do you have to do with the chair meter?  What is it?  I don't know.  The guy hung up.  Okay, something in four legs.  Oh, my God.  I'm itching.  I hate to have people tipping over.  Oh, my God.  Kenny, go get me some Benadryl.  I'm itching.  I got the invitation.  I sent it back.  That's nice, right?  The font was a little off, though.  It was.  I'm happy with it. 
[00:32:00]  Dude, how about this one?  We're doing like a little brunch thing like a lot of people do.  We had to pick out what sun we wanted.  What?  Already?  So hard to control that.  Did you know there's many fonts for the sun that we all wake up to?  Yeah.  We might just pick a stupid sun who cares.  And the ones with rays off of it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I know all of them now.  And the rising sun on a Japanese flag.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The thing.  There's a hip thing.  There's a conservative.  Smiley face one.  There's a conservative sun. 
[00:32:30]  There's a fun sun.  There's a blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  As long as he isn't gay.  Right.  As long as my son's not gay, just pick one.  So then emails and pictures are going back and forth for days.  I'm like, just pick a sun who cares.  Wow.  Wow.  It's beyond me.  Right.  I'd go nuts.  Why do you think the highs?  Why do you think the sore throat today?  Why the swollen foot?  Why?  Whatever. 
[00:33:00]  Do you have a swollen foot?  What's wrong with your little tootsies?  The chairs.  Give me a swollen foot.  Yeah, we really do have to.  Yeah, all right.  We're going to end up in the Poconos on my honeymoon.  That's wonderful.  In a big champagne glass.  Some couple from Iowa.  I just want something cool.  I want to be able to jump on some kind of like, how about a yacht?  Leaves from New York.  I wake up and it's somewhere warm.  Well, the weather's a little iffy for a yacht ride.  I know.  I don't know what to do. 
[00:33:30]  All right.  Why don't we, yeah, we have to break.  Okay.  Lots to do today.  Why don't you go skiing?  Ooh.  That's a good idea.  Yeah, I like that idea.  I'm going to go to the Swiss Alps or something or Finland or something.  Wow.  I was thinking like, you know, upstate.  But I'm saying if you want to.  All right, but this is what you just did to me.  Now I'm like, oh, skiing's cool.  But there's like a thousand places to choose from.  Yeah.  So now the panic has already started.  How about this?  You take what you just did to him.  He's getting a fat lip.  Take the risk.  A swamp lip.  Take the risk of making a bad choice.  If you guys make a bad choice. 
[00:34:00]  Teddy, give me some foul tricks.  If you make a bad choice.  Yeah.  Then you make a bad choice.  So you'll laugh about it.  You guys are going to go on vacations.  And she doesn't care that much either.  No, she's not worried about it.  You know, I'm not going to.  Go to Philly.  Jesus.  Have you been to Philly?  Exactly.  Go to D.C. or Detroit.  Yeah.  It's cold in the day.  It is cold in the day.  Go Phillies.  Opie and Anthony will do something next.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:34:30]  I was going to save this bit of info for a little later in the show, but we got some Zeppelin playing in the background.  John Paul Jones is a douche.  What?  And John Bonham's son, Jason, is a douche.  What?  You did nothing on your own, you little twerp.  Well, he played with Zeppelin.  When did they use the word twerp?  Back in the 70s?  No, it's perfect.  That's a perfect use.  It's still fine.  He's a twerp.  Yeah.  And Jimmy Page, what are you thinking? 
[00:35:00]  It's coming out today that, you know, Zeppelin got back together, sort of, because I don't acknowledge Zeppelin without John Bonham myself.  I do.  Do you really?  Yeah.  Bonham was good, though, on the bongos and stuff.  I don't acknowledge him because, and this goes against what you're going to say.  Yeah.  But because I think Robert Plant sucks now.  As singing for Zeppelin.  He's fine on his own, I guess, if that's what you're into.  But it's not, it doesn't sound like Zeppelin.  Well, he's touring with that broad. 
[00:35:30]  They do those, yeah, she's, I guess, popular in some community.  I don't know.  But it's coming out today that, you know, the band got back together.  They did very, very well, and they're excited.  They want to tour the world, and they actually want to, like, make new music.  That never works for most of these bands.  What?  And Robert Plant's like, nah, I'm not feeling it.  I don't want to do it.  You know, he's got a pretty successful career without Zeppelin.  He's doing stuff that, as a Zeppelin fan, I have no desire to listen to. 
[00:36:00]  Uh-huh.  But he's found an audience past Zeppelin.  So John Paul Jones just did an interview with the big, he's true.  And they're going to try to get a new Robert Plant and call themselves Zeppelin?  Zeppelin?  Really?  Without the lead, or just Zeppelin?  Uh, lead Zeppelin.  I think.  And they want to record new material.  Like, what are you doing?  Let it die. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, that's.  The Doors tried that.  And then, uh, what?  Like, Densmore sued the members of The Doors saying, look, you can't use The Doors' name.  I guess it's okay.  Without Jim Morrison, we're really not The Doors.  I mean, Densmore acknowledged that.  It's like, what are you doing?  For Journey.  A band like Journey, it's fine.  You get some bad.  It looks like Steve Perry.  It gets out there.  It's nostalgic.  People want to see it.  But, uh, Zeppelin.  That's a rough one.  Without Robert Plant, isn't Led Zeppelin.  It's not, you know.  And then I was starting to think, and I was going to, you know, Black Sabbath without Ozzy. 
[00:37:00]  But they made the switch very early on.  I think that's the difference.  I mean, Zeppelin.  And Dio's fantastic.  Dio's great.  John Bonham died, what, 28 years ago?  And that's pretty much when Zeppelin, you know, stopped doing their thing.  So 28 years later, you want to bring back Zeppelin with new material and tour the world  with a new singer?  It's stupid.  I got to be honest with you.  Bands can survive without the drummer. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  The drummer isn't that integral.  No, I understand that.  But like, like The Who, The Who wound up going on.  And I'm not talking about like The Who now, you know, because they're really getting up  there now.  And what's his name is Dead 2, bass player there.  Yeah.  But Ant Whistle.  Ant Whistle.  John Ant Whistle.  But, you know, they went on and had hits and a career after the drummer dies.  So, meh, it can happen.  But you get rid of Robert Plant and it's not Zeppelin anymore. 
[00:38:00]  You can get a guy in there that'll sound better than Robert Plant at singing Zeppelin.  I've seen Zeppelin cover bands that are like, wow, this is better than Zeppelin could possibly  sound live.  Yeah.  But it's not really Led Zeppelin.  I think you got to make the switcheroo early on.  Like, ACDC is a great example.  Yeah.  They were huge after Bon Scott died.  See a cover band for a $5 or $10 admission in a club and you're going to get better Zeppelin  than you will paying $150, $200 a ticket to see this Led Zeppelin without Robert Plant. 
[00:38:30]  Well, John Paul Jones, like, because he knows what people are going to say.  He's like, we don't want to become our own tribute band.  But that's exactly what you're going to be.  That's what it is.  That's exactly what you're going to be.  Yeah.  You know.  I'm just so annoyed.  And then someone on this feedback.  Oh, Blue Healer.  He's good for a bunch.  From Kentucky.  What about Alice in Chains with the black guy?  I'm a huge Alice in Chains fan.  It's not Alice in Chains.  I would go see that out of curiosity, which maybe goes against what I'm kind of saying right  now, but I wouldn't acknowledge that as Alice in Chains. 
[00:39:00]  But he's dead, though.  It's different when a guy dies.  It's like, Bonham is dead.  When a guy dies, how did it happen?  You mean Lane Staley?  Yes.  Or John Bonham or Lane Staley.  Yeah.  When you're dead, it's like, or like Bon Scott.  He died of hypothermia.  There's nothing you can do about that.  Right.  You have to move on.  True.  Yeah.  If you want to get the band going.  The ACDC story I heard was hilarious, where they just don't acknowledge Johnson still.  No.  It's like. 
[00:39:30]  Because he's not an original member.  Metallica made it through, you know.  They made it through.  All right.  So.  Those tragic losses.  All right.  Their first basis.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's update this.  James Hetfield decides.  He's not even.  He doesn't even die.  He decides.  I'm done with Metallica.  I want to go sing some fruity folk crap for a while.  Like plants doing, right?  Now, Metallica turns around and gets a new lead singer.  We're all supposed to go, all right, cool.  Hell no. 
[00:40:00]  It's not Metallica.  Thank you.  Yeah.  But if you follow the John Paul Jones logic, it's going to be Metallica.  We are going to tour and we're going to make new material without James Hetfield singing.  That's ridiculous.  If they want to do that, fine.  But don't try to charge me $200 a ticket to see a band that isn't banned.  You know?  Hey, whatever.  You know?  Who's to say the guy can't, you know, get some band together and say, ah, I want to, you know, 
[00:40:30]  go out and do some of the old tunes, make some new ones, but then don't try to pawn  it off like you're still Led Zeppelin or even call it something else.  I saw an old billboard on the New Jersey Turnpike going to Philly where they were advertising  Boston.  I was just like, and we did the whole, we did the bit on the show, the guys from Home Depot  or something.  Yeah.  It's a tribute band.  At least say that.  Look, look, we lost our guy.  You know, we want to continue.  I want to acknowledge that it's not going to be as good as the original lineup, but it's  kind of a tribute to Brad Delp. 
[00:41:00]  We're going to do the Boston thing in tribute to Brad Delp.  Here's our singer.  He was, you know, helping you out in Home Depot last year.  And he sounds good.  But now, yeah, and he sounds great.  But it's not the same.  Nope.  Led Zeppelin.  Let's say hi to Kate in Baltimore.  Kate.  I can't call it Led Zeppelin.  Kate.  Hello?  Oh, hi, Kate.  Hi.  Hi.  How are you guys?  Good.  From Baltimore.  I hear the black dude doing Lane Staley is amazing, but it's not. 
[00:41:30]  I'm sorry.  He's not Lane Staley.  Well, obviously.  I would see him in a little club and go, oh, that's kind of cool.  Too bad Lane Staley's not alive, because I never saw Alice in Chains.  I would have loved to have seen them.  Go ahead, Kate.  You're a wedding planner.  We're going to move on.  All right.  What do you got?  Well, I was going to explain to you the whole chair thing.  Oh, good.  What people were talking to you.  Like, you thought they were a lot of fun.  There are, like, 5,000 different types of chairs out there.  We've got, like, basic folding ones.  You've got Shavari chairs. 
[00:42:00]  You can go crazy.  And they're like, these are chairs.  And they're chairs.  You know, you guys are a waste of time, man.  Your wedding planners suck.  Hey, I don't.  I actually agree with you.  I mean, I don't agree that I'm a waste of time, but I think there are a lot of really  super nice things that people get hung up over.  That was funny.  She goes, I agree with you, but I take note that my existence is gone.  Yeah, because, like Anne said, you have to justify your paycheck.  I got it all figured out now.  Unfortunately, I didn't have it figured out beforehand.  I'm not taking a chair meeting. 
[00:42:30]  I know.  Matter of fact, I'm telling my wedding planner to get the most uncomfortable chairs ever.  So people don't sit there like every other wedding, like, duh.  Could you drive nails up from the bottom into the cushions, please?  Right.  Well, I think what a wedding planner would do to be, you, I want, I want, I want to  get, oh, shut up.  I hate you.  Just because you're a wedding planner, nothing against you personally.  I want to get chairs where, like, if you had scoliosis, you'd be very comfortable in. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Just something completely awful.  Because everyone thinks their wedding is a special day, and then you get there, and  you see everybody just sitting there doing nothing.  Like, oh, looking at the clock, huh?  Yeah.  Another wedding, huh?  This is my 50th in two years.  Let's get this over with.  Oof.  Your wedding's going to be fun.  I plan on relapsing on alcohol.  Nice.  All right, Jimmy.  The reception and really making it a to-do.  All right, I'll walk you through it.  Yeah.  That's my goal.  Then I know I had a special wedding.  Jimmy needs a drunk sponsor. 
[00:43:30]  It's like, he'll call me and go, look, I'm really thinking of drinking.  I'll go, I'll be right over.  Yeah.  And then we can drink together.  Yeah.  What about Guns N' Roses without Axel?  It's not Guns N' Roses.  I mean, people have their own opinion on this thing, but I think we kind of nailed it.  As long as you kind of tell your fans, yeah, it's a tribute.  Let's be honest with each other.  The Home Depot guy's not going to be getting the job done for real.  Can I tell you how bad after Ozzy got fired? 
[00:44:00]  That's why he left Sabbath.  And they brought in Dio, who did some great stuff.  And then Bill Ward left, and they brought in Vinny a piece.  I still consider those days Sabbath.  But after that, when Vinny and Ronnie left, then they had a couple of, then Geezer left.  It was one point called Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi in the really dark days, like in  the late 80s and 90s.  There's been 37 people in this band.  We've joked about it, but what's going to happen, fast forward another 20 years, all 
[00:44:30]  the bands we grew up with, like you've got to talk classic rock at this point, Zeppelin  and Sabbath and Journey and Boston and throw your favorite band out there.  These bands will continue without one original member.  Just the name going on.  The name is going to go on for decades.  It's so obvious, because this is where all these bands are heading.  They're going to just franchise the name like we joke about with our radio show.  Yep.  But these bands are going to be like Kentucky Fried Chicken.  The original guy died, what, 100 years ago.  Oh, the Colonel?  Oh, you can't say Kentucky Fried Chicken, because fried is a bad word. 
[00:45:00]  KFC.  KFC, that's right.  The Colonel died in like the 70s or the 80s or something like that.  I want KFC, actually.  What?  That sounds good right now.  I haven't had that in years.  I haven't had that in years, and that goddamn stuff is so good.  Let's make love over a bucket.  All right.  That was my go-to food when I was really hungover.  I'll throw mashed potatoes on your back.  KFC was my go-to food, man, when I just couldn't get out of bed.  But you know they have a new Colonel.  It looks just like the original Colonel.  Yeah, it's like Ronald McDonald. 
[00:45:30]  Do you think that's the same guy, that clown?  See, it's like Robert Plant.  They'll have a new Robert Plant.  Looks like the old guy.  Sounds like the old guy.  Sure.  We'll just franchise this crap out forever.  We've got to get back into some commercials, because we love commercials.  We're babbling so much, we've got to try to catch up and get this show back into a rhythm.  Please bear with us.  We are on this kind of schedule as far as Marshall's go.  Sabbath has had 17 former members.  I didn't realize there was that many.  Jesus Christ.  Now it's the D.O. lineup again for real, and then when they go out with Ozzy, if Bill 
[00:46:00]  Smart allows, it's a, you know.  I forgot, I was in Sabbath for a time.  Yes.  What are you?  17 members.  How do you have 17 members of a band?  People are asking about Van Halen.  That was a weird one, too, because to me, Van Halen without David Lee Roth is not Van  Halen.  It wasn't Van Halen.  Sammy Hagar comes in, and he did a great job, and they had a lot of hits.  But the guy also did his...  Sammy will never agree with that.  But hated Sammy Hagar. 
[00:46:30]  I'm not saying I like Sammy Hagar, but you've got to acknowledge that, you know, the band  was very successful after David Lee Roth with Sammy Hagar.  Totally different sound, except for Eddie's guitar, and I think Eddie, it was such a strong  presence as far as his guitar playing went that you could still say, and it's his name,  it's Van Halen, but it was not the David Lee Roth version.  Yeah, but if you sat an alien down on our couch and played him a Van Halen song...  See, I wouldn't do that first.  Why? 
[00:47:00]  I would want to know the secrets of propulsion, how he got here.  The Van Halen conversation would probably come in years later.  I talk to aliens every night, and they're ready to hang with us.  Okay.  They're not as scared as they used to be.  Give them my regards.  But you sit an alien down, or a cab driver, same thing, and you play him a Van Halen song  with David Lee Roth and a Van Halen song with Sammy Hagar.  Yeah.  They would swear it's two different bands.  True.  It's two different sounds.  Or the new stuff Van Halen did that they created when they were on the reunion tour. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, which song is that?  We're back!  I forget how...  Better than ever.  We're back!  We're better than ever.  We're back!  You don't remember your own song that you wrote for Van Halen?  We're together forever!  And that's how David Lee Roth would do it.  He'd be like...  Back!  He'd be like back-to-back with Eddie and look over.  We're back!  Look, you gave me goosebumps.  Yeah.  We've been away for a long, long, long, long time. 
[00:48:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Oh, man!  We've been away for a long, long, long, long time.  I didn't really...  We've been through changes.  We've played some games.  The more things change, the more things stay the same.  We're not an old man.  We're back!  We're better than ever 
[00:48:30]  We're back  We're back  Together forever  We're back  Oh yeah, I forgot about this song  We're back  We're better than ever  We're back  This is so bad  We're back  Together forever  We're back  We're back  Oh, I forgot the other one too  We're back  We're back 
[00:49:00]  Alright  They're back  I know they are  Got it, they're back  I forgot the funny song that they would do  was  We're a little bit older but we ain't much wiser  Right  Oh, it's just a douchey thing  What a douchey scenario you created  You know what though  It sounds like with a little work  that could be a song they would actually  Oh yeah, they would do it  Because you would be preening on stage  We're a little bit older but we ain't much wiser  You like to kind of tell each other 
[00:49:30]  Stop it  I can't even look  Alright, we gotta take another break  Alright  And then I think we'll be caught up  and we'll have a nice rhythm for the rest of the morning  Okay  Hey, we'll do a little primetime gossip here though  with Sam Roberts  We're back  And primetime gossip has some exclusive information  surrounding the mystery of who is leaving  the Opie and Anthony radio show  It was weeks ago that Opie first mentioned that someone was leaving 
[00:50:00]  but recently the Oapster brought the topic back up  and gave us a date  Somebody that has helped the show a lot is leaving  His last date's Friday  Really?  Yeah  After finding out that someone would be leaving the show  at the end of the week  All we were left with  was who it definitely was not  I don't know who it isn't  Oh  E-Rock  Oh  Because see, he doesn't do anything  Yes  But we continue to pay him  Now while we all know  Hoagie Boy will never go anywhere  PTG was able to uncover  this piece of audio 
[00:50:30]  shedding some light  on who is leaving the crew  Ha ha, rolling  We're gonna miss him  Where's he going?  What?  Where's he going?  What are you talking about?  Oh, you said you're gonna miss him  Oh  Oh, what?  That's right  Soft-spoken, psychotic talent booker  Roland looks to be the one leaving the show  And while we have no real confirmation  Primetime Gossip will say  without doubt  Roland will be homeless by Saturday morning  So long, Roland  Looks like the only thing opening Friday wide 
[00:51:00]  will be a guest book or position on O&A  Stay tuned  while PTG keeps you updated  as this latest story unfolds  Oh, now you're talking  Thanks  Thanks to who queued this up  Opie and Anthony  Lane Staley, man  I'm not familiar with  Oh my God  I mean, I've heard them, but  Start with the unplugged, Jimmy 
[00:51:30]  I got four copies of it  Because I was always losing it somewhere  So I was just  I would just buy another one  Start with Alice in Chains, Unplugged  Oh my God  Yep  Ant was a huge Alice in Chains fan too, right Ant?  Still am  Yep  I can listen to Unplugged again today, no problem  I've listened to it hundreds and hundreds of times  Start with Nutshell, Jimmy  How many albums do they have out? 
[00:52:00]  Ah, well  It gets confusing  Because then they did a live album  Then they did Greatest Hits albums  Then they did this  No, but I mean like  Just like the original stuff like that  There's not many  Four  Yeah, I bet  Maybe five or six  Somewhere around there  Ah, Opie and Anthony  Jim Norton  Let's not forget  Jim Norton's book comes out Tuesday  I Hate Your Guts  I'm doing book signing Monday  I'm doing them all next week  But Monday  The first one is at Borders  The same place it was  Penn Station  Yeah  I'm doing a book signing there  If you want to come down  I'll be plugging that  I won't be there  Are you waiting for the vocals to kick out?  No  Why? 
[00:52:30]  Because I'm becoming  I'm becoming a porn again Christian  And I don't agree with your views  My views are very Christian  Really?  That's what this book is about  It's about removing  The anti-Christian bias  In our society  Wait, did you say society?  It's about removing  The anti-Christian bias  In our society  We're just your lousy escape goat  You're the killers  Your whole sick society  That's who's guilty, man  It's about getting all escaped goats  Back into their pens 
[00:53:00]  The whole sick society  And I'll be wearing  A members only jacket  Yeah, will you?  And as your president  I need your attention  Just for a minute  There's a book  A book  The punk rock concert  The coroner walks on stage  And stops the punk show  All I want to think about  Is Quincy  I've seen your book  And the cover  Jim C  Seems very flat and smooth  Yes  We wanted to make it round 
[00:53:30]  And plump  But the publishers  Decided against it  Instead  Going with a flat  Untouchable cover  I said  How am I supposed  To rub my face  Against a flat  Untouchable cover  They said  At least you know  The book will be on the boat  When you get back  An hour from now  Jimmy  I was in  Who's Jimmy?  I was in  I was in Barnes and Noble  And I saw your book  On a table  And I was thinking  For your new book  You should have made it 
[00:54:00]  Into a perfect circle  Your book  Just somehow  Made it into a perfect circle  What a real inconvenience  Just a major inconvenience  For everybody  Just continues to roll  On the floor  The employees have to  Just keep picking up  Your book  Just something awful  Something really irritating  Like a  Yeah  Or just pins  Sticking out of it  Yeah  Kids grab here  And I'm getting  Suited by all the parents  Or  This would be  So inconvenient  Mix all the pages up  Right  It starts on page one  But then all of a sudden 
[00:54:30]  It's page like 200  And you gotta  And then you gotta look  Through the whole thing  To find page two  It's the best read ever  But yeah  You just drive them nuts  You're just looking  Through the book  And trying to find it  How annoying would that be?  I like it  Jimmy likes it  I like it  I'm doing the next  Supposed to be a murder mystery  And just mix  All the pages up  Jimmy for the second print  You should have  Like maybe  I don't know  A dozen  A dozen copies  Just like Anne's saying  Yeah  As a collector's item  Collector's item 
[00:55:00]  Where they're just mixed up  Missing one page  In the middle  And this way  You can't go to every bookstore  You'd have to buy it  But it's missing  It's like a Wonka bar  It misses one page  Yeah  And if you have that book  And you come to me  I go  You're right  The page is missing  And then we part ways  Nothing special  That's your gift  Is your moment with me  It's called  The moment in the sun promotion  Was that Meadow Soprano  On  She's really sexy  I think she's on Entourage 
[00:55:30]  I want to see what her  I haven't watched Entourage yet  This year  It's quite a popular program  Oh by the way  HBO  Thank you to all the fans  Did very well  So far  We don't know what's going to happen  We may not do more  We don't know  Let's keep our fingers  The Patrice episode  Was very very popular  Really  Yeah  Patrice is blowing up  I just got a hive  Honey why  What  I don't know why  Probably from the song before  I did  Did I just freak you out  I don't know  All my stress talking  What do you have  A to have simian aids  Going back and forth  What is this 
[00:56:00]  I don't know  You know  Ent and I have been at this  We all have it now  For a long time  We just  I scratched because I had an itch  And all of a sudden  I'm like  We just feel for each other  I'm so annoyed  By what he's going through  I can't even tell you  And I have nothing to do with it  Holy shit  Hey  Did you just curse  No he said holy shit  Oh  Yeah she's just amazing  She used to do our show  I don't know what happened  Yeah I don't know  Something must have happened  Nah she did our show after that  Did she  Yeah  Did she get a thing for me 
[00:56:30]  Before she became famous  Oh yeah  No  No  Of course not  Why would you believe that  I was  Because Jimmy's impish  Cute  Oh thank god  I've been called imp other things  As I sat there crying  And a girlfriend laid on the bed  Going it's okay  You're impish  I'm like wrong words  Stupid  Impish attempt  We got it  Impish  Way to drill a weaker joke home  At least you're drilling something  At least I'm drilling something  That's true  I'm in the back  Trying to drill for oil  With a piece of cooked spaghetti 
[00:57:00]  That from Grand Rapids  One page in Spanish  Jimmy  Ooh  One page in Spanish  I should do something like that  Just do something  Yeah  What do they win though  Nothing  They just get to be annoyed  Batch of cookies  And by the way  Can the girl  I'm sorry  The girl on MySpace  Who I'm talking to  Is going to send me chocolates  Send the chocolates  I want them  Wow  Sorry  By the way  Is that code for something else  Oh no chocolate  Oh  For the whole show  She's had it  I do want to announce  I finally went through  My MySpace 
[00:57:30]  After one year  Nice  I went through  And cleared house  I cleaned house  Everything's nice  So it's MySpace  Of course  And then slash  Anthony Cumia  C-U-M-I-A  How many potentials  Well I let it sit for a year  But there's  There's got to be  Some potentials in there  It's another hook in the water  Yeah of course  Of course  Yeah  MySpace.com  Slash Jim Norton  No it's slash  Anthony Cumia  C-U-M-I-A  No  Yeah  That one's been disabled  No  Well we got six days 
[00:58:00]  Before the  Don't be a  F***y hog  We got six days  Before the election  And at this point  And at this point  I think Obama  Should tell Biden  To go on vacation  Yeah  Because Biden is  Biden's at the point  Where he's like  If you make three bucks  We're taxing it  Yeah  They're adjusting  Their tax plan  Right up  Right up to the election  Right  Lowering and lowering 
[00:58:30]  What they consider rich  When they keep saying  They're going to tax the rich  Yeah  They just keep lowering  That bracket  It was $250,000  Right  Uh huh  And then  Biden  They said it was a slip  But he said $150,000  Uh huh  And then  There's commercials playing  That say  Families  Making $200,000  Now this is combined  Husband-wife  Income  So that's 
[00:59:00]  $100,000  Perhaps a piece  That you're making  So no one's even  Understanding anymore  What the hell  This idiot means  As far as  Where you fall into  This rich category  Yeah  Uh  Which just goes to  Bolster  My whole thing  Where I was saying  It uh  It has nothing to do  With the middle class  He's trying to get  The middle class  On board to vote for him  It's lower class  He wants to give  The middle class  And the upper class's money 
[00:59:30]  To the lower class  And he keeps proving that  By lowering this figure  Which is supposed to be  Where the rich line is  Eh what does it matter  He won the damn thing  It's over  I think he's uh  Yeah I think he's a  Shoo-in as they say  But Obama is  Making it hard on himself  Because uh  I think yesterday he said  He wants everyone to take  The day off  Their latest video says  Ask your boss  Ask your professors  For the day off  Wouldn't that help McCain  Probably  I mean 
[01:00:00]  I'm not even  Going with the joke  Wouldn't that help McCain  Uh  A lot of Obama's  Constituency  The 98% of  Black people  And stuff like that  Um  Would have taken a day off  Are they doing that  What's going on  I don't think  Yeah I think  That'll help McCain  I think there's more McCain  You know  Voters out there  That could benefit from that  Than Obama  I'm just saying  That's my guess  This infuriated me  A judge ruled that  Um  Homeless people 
[01:00:30]  Can actually use  Park benches  As their home address  To register for voting  And that is  Preposterous to me  They can use a park bench  As an address  So what do they write  Park bench down  Yeah and put you know  Hey at the corner of  Blah blah blah  Just like living on Park Ave  All right  What  You know who that's  Gonna help  Obama  Those are the people  That will vote for Obama 
[01:01:00]  I don't know  Oh really  A lot of Wall Street guys  Sleep on the benches  These days  You think they're still  Right  Could go either way  On this one  Yeah you gotta purge  Who cares  It's gonna be over soon  Thank God  Yep  Over soon  Uh  And uh  What else  There was something  Ah whatever  Oh uh  Is today uh  The night where Obama  Gets a half hour  Right before the World Series  Yeah  God he picked the  Best day man  Why  Cause the game's  2-2 in the 6th inning  Who's not tuning that in today 
[01:01:30]  Everybody that doesn't  Care about this World Series  Yeah but I could even  Tune in  6-3 innings  6-3 innings  It's high  That's easy  I could sit through that  I don't like sitting  Through baseball games anymore  But a 3-inning game  It's a 3-inning game  Polls do say that  He's only 2 points ahead now  Yeah  I just want to keep it interesting  He's  I guarantee he's farther than that  Who knows  You think  Yeah  Perhaps further than that  I think so  I don't think he's running away with it  Like Reagan and Bush didn't  I don't know  Um  You also have that 
[01:02:00]  That uh  Factor  You have to factor in the people  That say they're voting for him  And we'll walk into that voting booth  And vote for McCain  We'll see what happens  If McCain wins though  Wow  Batting down the hatches  Because they're already  Counting this as a win  Obama  All of his uh  His uh  Peeps  Counting it as a win already  I just don't think that  It's very close though Jimmy  Very close  But Palin I don't  I think was terrible  That's gonna sink him  She's not running for president 
[01:02:30]  Yeah but we all know  That he's  Believe me  He's not too far from a dirt nap  That weak old heart  Well  You know what dude  She takes over dude  They got the advisor  Really  I'd love to see him  Yeah but look at Dick Cheney  Yeah  His health was way worse  And he made eight years  The guy made it to the end  They were writing him off  For years they've been writing him off  That's true  First term they were writing him off  I really don't think that's a factor  I think McCain could easily 
[01:03:00]  You know  Survive four more years  But people think of it though  Because Dick Cheney was the  I call him the veep  A lot of people say  If I was president  I shorten it  That's just me  I say he's the real president  Oh come on  He's running things behind the scenes  Oh that's so obvious  You know that  Alright listen  We're gonna do a big A scenario  We're gonna take another break  It feels like all we're doing is breaking  What's going on here today  I know  Because we talked for a long time  During our first little talk session  Yeah  And when we get back 
[01:03:30]  Jocktober continues  But it's a little different today  It's based on something we did earlier in the week  Radio show commercials my friends  I love these  From all over the country  We got a Calgary show  We got one from Fargo  We got Houston  We got LA  We got Chicago representing  Florida  And yes  Also  New York City  Radio commercials  That's what we're doing today for Jocktober  These are horrendous  Wait till you hear the chicken dance song  Wait till you hear the chicken dance song

[01:12:30]  Take this home  It's a woman  In like tights  It looked like an ad  For some kind of  A woman's gym  Like curbs  Or something  It was the gayest thing  Oh Travis knows  Yeah was it  Go lean  Go lean  Go lean  Go gay  I'm looking at the  Go lean  Which is a Kashi brand  And no  They had some lame  People on the cover  Of this cereal  And it  It bloated out  My stomach  To like  Ethiopian proportions  And then all that 
[01:13:00]  Air had  Come out  And man  It was like  A mudslide  That was horrible  It was horrendous  Good friends  Some couple of people  On the box  I think the chick  Had a leotard on  Like who  Why  Is cereal like that  Necessary  I don't  It's either  I think like  If you wanna eat  Cheerios or something  Or  Some kind of  Granola thing  Good friends  And they got like  A black woman  And a white woman  And their heads  Are together  And they're smiling  Cause they're gonna  Have some cereal

[01:19:30]  Uh huh  This first one is  Matt and Eric  They decided to just  Sit in the lobby of a hotel  And turn a camcorder on  And that's their commercial  Yeah  Alright  Matt and Eric  One has an awful sweater  One has a collared shirt  Just a couple of creeps  There it is  Important thing for your audience  To remember when they wake up  In the morning  Always put pants on  Pants are important  I can't argue  Without food 
[01:20:00]  People would die  Without Matt and Eric  People would  Cry  It rhymes  If you go with the whole thing  Good  That's very good  Cry  Or sigh  Or dance  Just up there  Cry  That's their commercial  Let me  That's their commercial  Sometimes  That's not a YouTube video  That's something  That's very important  Yeah  Sometimes a script is important  You can't just go  You know something  Let's just turn the cameras on  We'll be sitting here  And we'll wing it  And it's gonna be gold 
[01:20:30]  That weren't it  The mic is bobbling into the shot  They should improv something  Really silly  Yeah it was  But that would take  Improv skills  It was just dull  It was just dull  Without Matt and Eric  People would  And he just went with  Cry  Cry  Dope  There's so many better words there  Yeah  Oh my god  This radio commercial  Makes me want to chew on a hobo cyst  Kevin from Connecticut  Right  That had no humor to it at all

Steve from Bayshore wants to know if Stuntbrain wrote that.  Oh.  When you worked for the Bob show in Fargo.  Oh.  Because apparently you've worked for everybody.  We got Carrie in Fargo checking in.  Carrie. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, Carrie.  Okay, I really don't have much, but I turned on my XM radio here,  and I heard that Bob thing, and I thought my radio, my XM thing broke.  He scared me.  And it's everywhere.  It's on the TV.  It's on the radios.  It's nasty.  That's all.  Oh, they're still playing that one, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's not even a single lyric, though.  Yeah, sure, you betcha.  Hey, have you seen Babe, the big blue ox?  Yeah, sure.  You've been up to Brainerd? 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  Actually, last summer I was in Brainerd shopping downtown.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Hey, you've been to the Ramada Inn up there.  That's pretty nice.  Actually, it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's my deal here, see.  It's my deal here, see.  He gets so out.  A finder's fee?  I don't need a finder's fee.  I need the money, Wade.  He gets so out by his father-in-law.  I love when you guys go into Fargo.  It's just funny. 
[01:25:00]  All right.  Well, that's it.  Okay, Carrie.  Okay.  See you later, then.  Thanks a lot, then.  Okay.  Okay.  Watching him try to hold it together.  It's fantastic.  Amazing how great he was.  Okay.  He's smiling.  Okay.  Okay.  These numbers are right.  This looks pretty sweet.  Okay.  Okay.  And he goes out to scrape the ice off his windshield after Wade turned his money down, and he just  starts bashing his windshield with the ice scraper, and then has to go and pick it  back up and just starts scraping again. 
[01:25:30]  A finder's fee.  A finder's fee?  No, I need all that money, Wade.  Hey, I'm not running a bank here.  What a dick.  What a prick Wade was.  Oh, Wade was an ass.  So happy he got shot.  Glad he got shot.  Of course.  Let me see my daughter.  Who the hell are you?  I'm watching that tonight.  I'm just popping that back in.  Fantastic movie.  Go ahead.  It was all believable how it went.  Yeah. 
[01:26:00]  It was all believable.  Of course.  Just this snowball rolling downhill of just cluster F.  Oh, my God.  With him just, yeah, yeah, okay, okay.  The guy would call, this is GMAC.  We're calling about the cars, the VIN numbers.  I'm going to need you to send those over.  Yeah, I'm sending them over.  Right now.  I'll fax them over to you.  And he's, like, writing them in pencil so you can't see the numbers because he's been  just selling off cars or getting illegal loan money.  Whatever he was into, it was bad, and he couldn't keep it together or fix it. 
[01:26:30]  And he needed money desperately.  Just horrid.  Kidnapped my wife.  Okay.  Okay.  No, I'm sure she's fine.  Oh, God.  What do you think they're doing to mom?  Oh, she's fine.  They just want the money.  I still say it's a comedy, though.  My girl didn't think so when she saw the woodchipper scene.  I'm like, no, this is a comedy.  Yeah, that made it a porno.  Total comedy.  Swing and a mess on that one. 
[01:27:00]  I didn't expect a standing ovation, but I also didn't think indifference would be the  thing.  Oh, boo.  Oh, boo.  Oh, that's my joke, Wade.  Wade, a polite applause.  I need guffaws here, Wade.  Yeah, I need big laughs, Wade.  A smile and a polite nod.  It's in a comedy club.  Well, that's obvious by the reaction, Wade. 
[01:27:30]  I got to hear Wade talk now.  Yeah, Wade.  E-Rock, what do we got next?  We're doing radio show commercials today for Jack Tolbert.  The next one is out of Houston.  It's from 1986 on a station, K-L-O-L.  That was a powerhouse, K-L-O-L in Houston.  Right?  That was a powerhouse.  Wow.  Rock and roll army.  We did one of those radio junkets with these douches back in the day.  Really?  Yeah, down there in L.A. 
[01:28:00]  They were just loud, obnoxious a-holes.  I just remember so many of those junket things.  As we did in those stations.  Hey, hey, Chicago.  The guy's from Chicago.  Remember Chopper?  The Chopper.  I love Chopper.  That was down in Turks.  My opinion.  Chopper.  He was a raging alcoholic.  Oh, my God.  Remember his bar bill and none of us were making money?  I'm like, how are you affording this bar bill?  The Chopper.  That guy.  Where was he out of?  I think Minnesota. 
[01:28:30]  Minnesota or something.  All right, let's listen to the K-L-O-L radio show commercial.  101-K-L-O-L, the Album Rock Station.  Presents those radio tough guys.  Stevens and Pruitt.  They work with the nation's top comedy writers.  They really dig for news you can use.  And they hang out with the traffic master, Lanny Griffith.  Ha!  So listen to Stevens and Pruitt.  We won't tell your friends.  They're your coach class ticket to comedy. 
[01:29:00]  Stevens and Pruitt.  Mornings on 101-K-L-O-L.  Houston's only Album Rock Station.  Ugh.  God damn.  That's bad.  Where do we begin with that one?  But with the end, just let it sit.  That was really hack.  Yeah.  Wow.  And you should have seen the actual commercial.  Very...  Very wacky.  Very wacky. 
[01:29:30]  Very...  And what do they call their traffic guy?  Like a music video or something.  The traffic master.  The traffic master.  Why?  What does he do?  What does he do?  That's so important.  Why do you have to promote the traffic person?  He would do the traffic with sound effects of whips and noise for the fact he was the  traffic master with traffic and bondage.  And he described all the traffic with sort of dominatrix-y terms.  Like what?  That's...  He would say...  That can work.  That can work, like, for a bit.  You do maybe a couple times.  Not every morning.  That's what these guys don't understand.  You don't do those dumb bits every morning. 
[01:30:00]  Then it becomes awful.  Like, if it's raining, would they say, like, well, there's golden showers?  Yeah.  Well, maybe.  Yeah, they actually did stuff like that.  But he'd say, oh, there's a tie-up on the Southwest, and you people need a good whipping,  and then he'd make little whips on the tracks.  Oh, my God.  And whenever he appeared in public, it was all in black leather and rubber.  Ugh.  Oof.  Yeah.  So if everybody was rubbernecking, he'd say, well, there's a cuckolding situation.  Because everybody's watching this black SUV be serviced.  Well, prepped. 
[01:30:30]  Prepped.  Yeah, you've got to prep the bull, Jimmy.  We all know that.  It's all about cuckolding.  You've got to prep the bull.  Like we used to do, or Anthony used to do, Charlton Heston traffic.  It was good.  It was a really good bit, but you don't do it every morning, because then it doesn't  become good anymore.  No.  I couldn't do it now.  It just seems silly.  Right.  All right.  We move on to Mark and Brian.  Yuck.  They're out of KLOS in Los Angeles.  This was a commercial for a TV show that NBC gave them in the 90s.  Yeah, I remember. 
[01:31:00]  The Adventures of Mark and Brian.  It was a horrendous failure.  This thing was...  Wow.  The Adventures.  This thing failed so bad that they never offered another TV show to a radio show.  Well, they did give...  They ruined it for everybody.  What's his name?  Who?  Brandon?  Oh, Brandon.  Brandmeier.  Yeah.  Jonathan Brandmeier.  Johnny B on the Loose.  Yeah.  Well, that's that show.  And that was another disaster.  I've got to itch my...  You want me to scratch your bag? 
[01:31:30]  Nothing like...  I'll pitch it.  Nothing like XFL Game Day, which I remember that show.  Those guys really made that work.  Yeah, we did all right.  It was the league that sucked.  Here's Mark and Brian.  Mark and Brian.  Did you have those girls do that?  No, I thought you did.  I just was going to offer the audience a beautiful plan.  Brian, you can't buy the audience with a beautiful plan.  Watch our show, we'll give you a treat.  We can't say that.  Why?  Well, it's not true.  Besides, I think we need to go for the emotions.  Come on, puppy. 
[01:32:00]  It's fixed.  It happens.  We got lunch.  Look at this.  These guys will do anything to get on TV.  We'll come over and mow your lawn.  We'll clean out your downspout.  We'll snake your toilet.  What?  We're pushing.  Sorry.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, gee.  That was their nationwide spot, too.  I'm freezing all of a sudden.  I'm freezing.  Are they still on out there?  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess so.  Those mullets are fantastic. 
[01:32:30]  Who doesn't have a mullet in their past, though?  Well, I'll give them that, but it's like...  I never knew the one guy sounded...  Little Femi?  Little Femi?  A little Femi in his throat?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He might have wrestled with the sword of the...  A few times.  You think he's been...  You think he's been nose deep?  Oh, yeah.  Had to be.  I don't know.  Make this sound, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because your mouth is so full. 
[01:33:00]  How would you know that?  Because I've had girls do it, so I know what it sounds like when they're...  So you just take it down an octave or so, and it's what he sounds like.  Now go...  Oh, you...  I'm so skeeved out. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, my God.  God, that's something.  Yeah.  Boy, you got that one down there, Jimmy.  All right.  So far, the listeners are hanging with us, but, you know, it's about a C-plus right  now, Iraq.  What do we got next?  The next one is another Jack station in Chicago. 
[01:34:00]  Okay.  WJMK.  Their whole commercial for the station is Music Puns.  Music Puns.  All right.  1043 Jack FM is where Goo Goo Dolls train stray cats on a green day.  And Spin Dolls...  It's impossible to have a green day.  Of course it is.  Unless there's boogers falling from the sky.  What?  Oh, oh.  But...  Goo Goo Dolls train stray cats on a green...  On a green day. 
[01:34:30]  This...  This is terrible.  This is really...  This is...  1043 Jack FM is where Goo Goo Dolls train stray cats on a green day.  And Spin Doctors cure Pink Floyd's madness as the police rush Aerosmith to Lincoln Park.  It's where men at work fix Skid Row and bare-naked ladies kiss Van Halen.  While Elton John cries tears for fears because he can't squeeze Bon Jovi.  No doubt you too can find Nirvana at 1043 Jack FM. 
[01:35:00]  Playing what we want.  Hoofah.  You could have made that edgy.  I thought that was.  The police driving...  Why would they drive Aerosmith to Lincoln Park?  I don't get it.  Yeah.  Where's Lincoln Park?  Why did Aerosmith have to go there?  Yeah.  And we're all trying...  He rushed there by the police.  And we're all trying to think of a better Elton John one, aren't we?  Of course we are.  What's out?  What was the Elton John one?  It cries tears for fears. 
[01:35:30]  Yes.  It cries tears for fears because...  Of Elton John.  Oh, we could do a better Elton John than that.  Yeah.  He was in bands.  Or a hole.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, add in tool perhaps.  Yeah, exactly.  Elton John is crying tears for fears because...  Of the tool up his hiney?  No.  Is there a band named Hiney Hole?  It's not a band.  There's a band called Hole.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we're getting somewhere.  All right.  We got Elton...  All right.  It's like...  What? 
[01:36:00]  Butthole Surfers.  All right.  We got Butthole Surfers.  That's a real band.  We got Elton John.  We got Tears for Fears.  And we got maybe Tool.  Well, we were just talking about this band back in the office.  Perhaps Hum has something to do with it.  Yeah.  A little Hum.  Stars.  Which, by the way, quickly, Cadillac, go F yourself using that great Hum song in your  TV ad.  Why would Cadillac be to blame instead of Hum for selling their song to Cadillac?  You think that's what happened?  Of course.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  But what is Hum doing these days anyway? 
[01:36:30]  Nothing.  That song Stars is Cadillac.  Making money on Cadillac ads.  Yeah, I know.  But that Star song by Hum is one of the...  Wow.  Love that.  Anyway.  Cadillac wants to hip themselves up.  They have been for years.  Elton John's crying tears for Fears for his...  This is a real band.  AC.  Oh, yeah.  You can only call him AC.  Yeah.  Hmm.  All right.  Should we try another one here?  Well, they're doing their own Elton John thing. 
[01:37:00]  Music pun.  We'll get to that in a second.  Hey, there's a commercial with WNEW Afternoons.  Is this ours?  Maybe.  Dude, we had nothing to do with...  Is this the Howard one?  No, this isn't the Howard one.  Oh, okay.  I mean, we're really frustrated because every other state...  Oh, this was...  You know what?  Is this bad, though?  No, it's clean for the... 
[01:37:30]  But N.E.W. decided to give us a commercial, but I don't know where the hell it ran.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't remember.  This is what they went with.  I mean, we're really frustrated because every other station in New York has TV commercials.  The big spring promotion.  They're giving away money and trips and stuff going on.  And they got Ed Kotz doing their TV commercial for them.  It's time to promote what we're doing.  Promotion.  Promotion.  Promotion.  We're in a transitional period.  We're transitioning to being more pissed every day.  Well, that's because of all the support we've gotten around here, Anthony. 
[01:38:00]  Of course.  Boy, the ratings are going up like if I had a Geiger counter.  Woo!  You could just hear them pouring in.  Wow, that sounds like something we could have done two days ago.  It's actually...  And on the screen, what's happening as you guys are talking, it's a black screen with  just words.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can you play that again, Danny?  And I'll tell you, as this is playing in the background, it's Opie and Anthony 3-7 on  the 1027-WNW, then it fades out.  They believe the only thing between them and Radio Glory against white letters on a black 
[01:38:30]  screen...  Is a TV spot.  Is a TV spot.  So, yeah, they're putting this on the screen as we...  Bitch.  Bitch.  Bitch.  Bitch.  Get some ratings.  We'll throw in pictures next time.  That's what it says.  And then it's the logo.  That's fine.  That's actually not a big logo.  Yeah, put the spot up on onaradio.com.  I was hoping that would be totally douchey.  Mm-hmm.  That's all right.  Whatever.  All right.  We'll continue in just a bit. 
[01:39:00]  Cadillac.  No, it's home.  Stars.  Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  The new Escalade.  Yeah, exactly.  A hybrid Escalade.  That's right.  877-212-ON-A.  So, they got the Elton John thing figured out.  Elton John cries tears for fears because he made a puddle of mud.  Chat from Jersey. 
[01:39:30]  And Jason and P.A., kind of similar.  Elton John cries tears for fears because he saw bare naked ladies.  And then should I do one for the satellite audience?  Acknowledging that this might not fly on regular radio?  No.  Really?  I'd wait.  Really?  Yeah.  Elton John.  Sting.  Prince.  Sizz.  Mm-hmm.  King Missile.  Uh-huh.  Oh, I gotcha.  Flaming Lips.  Yeah.  Minute Work. 
[01:40:00]  Uh-huh.  All right.  I just did a Mad Lib.  Yeah.  Fill in the blanks.  All right.  Where are we at?  Where are we at?  Oh, we noticed a while ago that McCain likes to use my friends a lot.  I never noticed that.  He just throws it in very casually in a conversation like, hey, my friends.  This is where his friends.  We put a little montage together. 
[01:40:30]  Yes, we do.  This is from only, I think, two speeches?  Three.  Three, thanks.  Three speeches, that's it?  Oh, boy.  Three speeches.  Why'd you just ruin it, Iraq?  No, it's from 17.  See what I was trying to do there?  Sorry.  Yeah.  If it was from two and not three, it makes it even more ridiculous, and that's what I  was going for.  But thanks for correcting me to make it less ridiculous.  Thank you, Iraq.  Okay.  I can always count on you.  Then again, a poor stupid had said, yeah, no, it's from two of you, and he yelled at him,  why aren't you telling me the right number? 
[01:41:00]  He can't win.  No.  No.  But that's his job on the show, to never win.  Iraq is the star of a fine video on YouTube, the Hot Wax videos.  Horse gag.  Here's my friends, the montage from three speeches.  We all know, my friends, I know how to do that, my friends.

I could have been kicking that Mr. Bandit's ass around the moon by now  And what the hell  One more play  Mark Maron was in last week  And he came up with a great Obama ad  Actually, I think it's a McCain ad, right?  Oh, sure, yeah  I think this is a McCain ad  I saw this before the World Series the other night 
[01:44:30]  Couldn't believe that they allowed this to fly on  On network TV  This was unbelievable  Mark Maron, everyone  This is the most important presidential election of our lifetime  And some of you are still  Undecided  Let's have some straight talk  We've tried to convince you that Barack Obama is inexperienced  We've tried to convince you that Barack Obama is a terrorist  We've tried to convince you that Barack Hussein Obama is a Muslim 
[01:45:00]  We're done with trying to convince you  Let's be honest  Barack Obama is black  Black  My friends  Think about it  A black president  Come on  Are you crazy?  This is America  Some things don't need to be changed  I'm John McCain 
[01:45:30]  A white guy  And I approve this message  Hey  Nice McCain ad right there  You think John McCain, you know, out of desperation would like  From that  The last ditch effort, please  Nothing to lose, what the hell  Hi, David  Intern David  David  What was the problem with the candles we used?  Oh, David  Oh, David  Hold on a minute  Hold on  Let me set up the bit there, David  We did a little something where we were splashing hot wax on E-Rock's body yesterday 
[01:46:00]  And the video's up  It's pretty good  Got a great reaction out of E-Rock  And the day before we told Danny to get some candles  Kind of like the ones we have at FH Riley's  Where the hot wax collects in the little candle jar  Whatever you want to call it  And then it makes a nice little shot glass of steaming hot wax  Yeah  Piping hot, I should say  Piping hot  And Danny went and got some candles  Who cares?  And it turns out that there's some Jewish candle 
[01:46:30]  He was very offended  And where's Intern David's music?  He doesn't talk unless he has his music  David, you don't talk until you hear your music, my friend  Your Jewish music  My friend, my friend, my friend  My friend, my friend  My friend, my friend, my friend  Alright, here we go  Intern David  Good morning, David  Hey, David  Hi  Oh, he's dancing  Good morning  So, what was the problem with the candles we used for our little stunt yesterday?  Well, I heard about what happened that you threw hot wax at E-Rock yesterday 
[01:47:00]  Yes  I saw it all  I saw the mess on the ground also  Yeah, there's still wax on the floor  Correct  Which he's very upset about also because of these candles  Yeah, yeah, the wax on the floor is a different reason  I'm upset because it's not clean  It's good to know that the intern saw the wax on the floor but didn't clean it up  Of course  Wouldn't that be his job, Danny?  To clean up the wax, clean up after us?  I would certainly think so  Yeah  Alright, so what was the...  But the main important thing was that the wax that was thrown at E-Rock came from a Jewish candle 
[01:47:30]  It's called a yard site candle  A what?  A yard site candle  What does that mean?  It's a candle that you light when you're signifying the death of somebody  The anniversary of someone's death in the family  Like every time there's a death in the family you have to light a candle for the whole day  And you have to say a certain prayer at the temple and you have to do all this stuff  Like a lot of people when someone dies they fast for the whole entire day  On the anniversary of someone's death  More suffering  More fasting 
[01:48:00]  It's bad enough that you lost a family member  Now you're going to starve yourself?  Have a pork sandwich  What the hell?  Why do you have to make death even in Swiss?  It's called a yard site candle  So when on the anniversary of someone's death in the family  Like your mother or your father  Leave it to the Jews to make death even worse than it is already  Like your mother or your father or your wife  If they died you have to light that candle at the anniversary of their death  Your wife, why?  She can dance around it and sing?  To remember them  To signify and remember them  To remember them  So why are you upset?  But you remember them all year, don't you? 
[01:48:30]  Wouldn't you like remember them every so often?  Like I've had relatives that have died  And I don't on a specific day remember  But every so often  We remember it on the anniversary of their death  Alright, it was the anniversary of someone's death yesterday  What's the big deal?  In the family member  Well for the first year  The prayer you say on the anniversary of the death, right?  Yeah  But in the beginning  When the person first dies  The family member gets to say the prayer every single day  For the first year  For the first year you say the prayer every single day  And then afterwards  You just say the prayer on the anniversary of the death 
[01:49:00]  They're dead, let it go  Wave at the box  It's called a yard site candle  And the point is that they were throwing wax from a sacred Jewish object onto erod  What do you mean it's a yard sale candle?  Yard site  Yard site  Yard site  It's like a  Kind of like a Jewish term  Y-A-H-R-Z-E-I-T  Yeah  If the label wasn't on it  You'd never know  So much difference  Exactly.  Where'd you get these, Danny?  Well, you might know because there is a Star of David kind of embossed on the top of the candle. 
[01:49:30]  You didn't notice that, huh?  No, absolutely not.  These are special.  Yeah, I got these.  It's a special candle because it's built to last for the whole entire day.  It just burns 24 hours.  Yeah, it burns for the whole entire day.  Where'd you get these?  I did get these at a specialty candle store called Key Food.  Oh, Key Food.  Oh, Key Food Candles.  Okay.  Exactly.  Key Food.  That would be a supermarket for the rest of the country.  They have yardside candles.  They own your local supermarkets.  Let me say hi to Chris in Wisconsin.  Chris, what's going on?  What does he say about the yardside candles? 
[01:50:00]  You shut the F up and he'll tell you.  David, you're worried about the candle?  Yes, I'm worried.  Did you build your tent?  No, I didn't build the sucker.  No.  You're worried about this, but you didn't build your tent last week.  Did you build the sucker?  Shame on you.  Where was your sucker?  All right, there he goes.  What competition here?  John in Jersey has a very good question for intern David.  Go right ahead.  Hey, David. 
[01:50:30]  I was just wondering what would happen if somebody died every day of the year?  Would you just starve to death?  Yeah, when would you stop the fasting?  Knowing that it would kill you as well.  It's not every single person.  It's only like a family member or a relative.  Or someone that was really close to you.  Family member or relative would be the same thing.  Family member or relative.  A wife or a spouse.  Correct, correct.  A son or a child.  Keep going, Jim.  A mother or daughter.  A mother or stepmother.  Yeah, something like that.  He missed the point.  Of course, he did completely. 
[01:51:00]  He always misses the point.  I got the point that you're making fun of.  Hence the frustration.  I got it.  You're making fun of me because I repeated the same word.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  You were done.  I hate you, David.  Oh, David's a good boy.  All right, John.  We love David.  All right, John.  But as far as offending your religion, what we did, is that as bad as knocking over a menorah  on someone's lawn on Hanukkah or something like that? 
[01:51:30]  It's pretty bad, yeah.  It's pretty bad that we use this for a radio bit.  Yeah, because it's a yardside candle.  You're only supposed to light that to signify someone's death and remember the death of  someone, and now you're using it to throw hot wax at E-Rock.  Who we wish was dead.  Can we throw hot wax on intern David?  What if your power went out in the house and it was dark, and all you had was a yardside  candle?  Mm-hmm.  Would you light it for light in the house? 
[01:52:00]  Mm-hmm.  David?  I probably would consider it.  See, but then it wouldn't be being used for the same thing it's supposed to be used  for, for the death of a loved one.  So you would be using it for something completely different, as did we use it for something different.  Correct.  See?  Do you see the hypocrisy there?  Yeah, I do, I do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me say hi to Charlie of Brooklyn.  A big fan of intern David.  Charlie.  Who isn't?  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Hi, brother, man, and mother hookers.  How's it going?  What's up, Charlie?  Oh, God, he nailed you Linger Longer.  Linger.  He is driving me effing crazy.  He knows nothing.  Hey, David, my father died seven years ago.  Nobody fasted.  We had more food than we knew what to do with.  The only thing is we didn't want to eat because we were sad.  Dude, it's just a pile of wax, you dope.  Everyone has different bullies, and they do whatever they want to for Judaism, and my 
[01:53:00]  family does it a little different.  That's true.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Charlie makes it.  I went to a receiver for seven years.  I think I paid a couple thousand dollars to figure something out.  There you go.  Charlie has it all figured out.  But to each their own, right, David?  To each their own.  My family, we...  Can we throw the hot wax on you or not?  No, no.  Why?  Because it gets offensive to me.  How about for a non-Jewish candle?  Yeah.  How about a regular candle?  Like somebody with the pulp on it we can all laugh at to make even the score. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, we'll burn one of those candles that you see in churches.  No problem.  We'll do that for the bit.  Yeah.  How about a regular candle?  A regular Yankee candle?  A regular...  Yeah, a regular non-denomination.  Ooh, I like Yankee candles, Jim.  Yes, I do, too.  Perhaps an apple cinnamon, David.  What's your favorite flavor of Yankee, uh...  I like lard.  The lard scent wafting through my apartment is very sensual, Gregory. 
[01:54:00]  Ted, why would you like that when there's so many nice scents?  That is nice, Anthony!  I don't like apples.  They make me break out.  Vanilla is a great...  I don't like vanilla.  It makes my testicles shrivel.  Do we have Ted the Candle Maker in studio today?  This is unbelievable.  No, I'm just Ted the Consumer.  Oh, Ted the Consumer.  Ted the Candle Consumer.  Yes, I'm Ted the boy with olfactory senses.  Do you like the one that smells like a Christmas tree?  No, I don't.  I don't like it at all.  Throw hot wax at me. 
[01:54:30]  What?  What's the matter, young David?  We're in the middle of a bit, David.  Yeah, David!  What are you doing?  You're talking over Ted!  Ted the overused character!  I'd rather hear from David anyway.  Ted can die.  David took his headphones off and thought that no one could hear him magically.  Yeah, what happened?  It doesn't work that way.  What were you bitching about now?  What's the matter, David?  Nothing.  I was just wondering if you guys were thinking about throwing hot wax at me.  Yes, thinking about it.  Out of a bucket.  Why do you think this candle's lit?  We've had it stored since yesterday.  Give me another 15 minutes.  We'll be ready for it. 
[01:55:00]  Yes.  Brooklyn Ace, what do you got?  Oh, am I on hold?  No, you were laughing through the whole Ted bit for us, which is nice.  What do you got, bro?  I love Ted.  I really love Ted.  I love you too, Brooklyn ass.  Ace.  Oh, Ace, sorry.  Give your ass on Ace of Spades.  Bull.  Abua.  I'm tired.  Oh, shit.  Bull!  Oh, it looks like someone has a little potty mouth.  Although, incidentally, that's my favorite scent of candle after a lard. 
[01:55:30]  A log candle.  It's a nice brown one you put on your table, and it clears the room nicely.  Now, you're saying you have a complaint there about young people?  Oh, yeah.  Thanks.  Hey, David.  Yes?  It's not a yard's eye candle.  It's a yut's eye candle.  Yut's?  Bob, I'm an Irish Catholic, and I know that, you moron. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, you're a moron.  It doesn't say yut's.  It's not yut's sight.  It's yart's sight.  Right.  Why would he tell you about your religion?  It's not yut's sight.  Yut's is something you call somebody, right?  You go, yeah, you yut's.  You yut's.  Right.  Wait, is that Yiddish?  I think so.  All right, let's go to Kevin in Connecticut.  Schmuck.  Morning, guys.  Whoa, what happened, David?  Whoa, David.  Hold on, hold on.  Let me start the music.  What happened there?  What happened there?  Can you say that word over here in this station?  I don't know.  I would assume you can. 
[01:56:30]  What's referring to you?  I don't think it's a bad word.  Is it very bad in Hebrew?  What word, Anthony?  What word?  Schmuck.  I don't mean in Hebrew.  I mean, in general, on this particular radio station right here.  Can you say that over at CBS?  Say it, say it, say it.  I think you can't say that over here.  What, schmuck?  Yeah, can you?  Say it.  Come on, David, say it.  I think we should beep that out.  Bleep.  I think we should beep that out.  Say it.  I think we should beep you out.  Say it.  I'm not saying that.  Go ahead.  Just let it fly.  I don't think it's appropriate for this station. 
[01:57:00]  Say schmuck.  They'll beep it out.  They'll bleep it anyway.  Yeah.  Just say it.  They'll beep out.  Yeah.  So mommy and daddy won't hear you saying it.  It's not for mom and dad.  It's just for the station, I don't think.  Right.  You're protecting the license.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's wrong with the word schmuck?  I don't know.  I thought that was offensive.  What does it mean?  And, like, what's the translation from Yiddish?  It's just not.  It's just like an asshole, like an idiot.  Well, that you can't say.  Yeah, it's like an idiot.  That was a good one.  It's like an idiot.  No, not idiot.  I know.  The other one you just said is.  You can't say that. 
[01:57:30]  One word you can't say.  You can say schmuck, but you can't say.  I can't say schmuck either.  Oh, you just said it.  That's right.  Oh, David.  Two dumps, David.  Oh, no.  What's that about?  Congratulations.  Oh, no.  You can't say schmuck either.  Third time.  Oh.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Connecticut.  Kevin, we're talking with intern David.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  This intern David is a very unorthodox Jew.  Unorthodox.  I'm not orthodox.  I never claimed to be.  Oh, he never claimed to be.  I claim to be conservative.  David Johansson.  Yeah.  A lot of people saying that the candle's not even that holy. 
[01:58:00]  Let's go with David from Israel.  He should know.  Oh, another David.  David, are you really calling from Israel?  I am really calling from Israel.  All right.  We do have an audience around the world, thanks to the intertubes.  Good morning, boys, and happy birthday, Yimmy.  Thank you.  Um, um, the candle, um, they're used, like, on the anniversary of the death, just to remind  you there's nothing holy about it whatsoever.  If there's blackouts in the house, I use it.  Um, on some of the holidays, we're not a lot of light fires, but we could smoke cigarettes, 
[01:58:30]  so we could light a cigarette off the candle.  I get a big one that lasts for 12 days.  I use it by all the holidays.  No problem whatsoever.  There's no problem in using it.  David, you gotta come here and learn about your own religion.  Yeah, this is from Israel.  They're in a war zone.  Have you ever made the pilgrimage, uh, to your homeland, David?  Oh, I've been.  I've been there, yes.  You've been to Israel?  I have.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Oh, I have.  It's on the tourism poster.  Did you plant a tree?  I planted a tree, yes.  You planted a tree? 
[01:59:00]  I planted a tree at the JNF forest.  Oh, I didn't know that.  They have a forest?  The JNF forest, yeah.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Didn't you work at a kibbutz?  Didn't you?  What, did I say something incorrect?  No, I did work at a kibbutz.  You worked at a kibbutz.  What did you do?  What?  What did you do at the kibbutz?  Um, they had a hotel in the kibbutz, and I was in a kitchen, like working in a kitchen.  What is a kibbutz, though?  A kibbutz is like a communal, uh, a communal living place, like a farm, but like for a 
[01:59:30]  community where people live together, and they like, do all, share all the responsibilities.  They don't have outside jobs in the outside world.  They all work for the farm.  They all work together.  Is that like a, is that like a Jewish orgy?  It's sort of.  I mean, they all live together.  Like, they all share their responsibilities.  They all, like, some people work in, like, the dining hall.  Like, they all eat dinner together.  They all share all the jobs together.  They all live and work together.  Do you speak Jewish?  No.  How did you get along there without really speaking?  Do you speak Hebrew?  Yeah, yeah, I speak some.  Were you speaking a lot of English there? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, they all know English there.  They all know English.  They learned, starting in first grade.  They all learned English, starting in first grade.  How old were you when you went to Israel?  Uh, I think I was 18, I think.  18?  18, so, uh, you go over there, and, uh, were your parents nervous about sending you there?  With, you know, there is a bit of terrorism over there.  Uh, it was kind of, it was kind of quiet, and it wasn't as bad, like, when I went there.  And it got bad, like, a month after I went there, it started getting bad.  Yeah?  So, we do, would they tell you, don't take the buses and stuff? 
[02:00:30]  The program that I was on, they wouldn't let us, like, go on a lot of buses.  They wouldn't.  And they wouldn't let us go to certain places.  They restricted us.  So, you worked at the kibbutz?  No, because that was at the end.  At the end.  The end of the program.  What did you do, like, at the beginning?  Did you go to the Wailing Wall?  Yeah, the beginning was in Jerusalem.  Did you bang your head and stuff against it?  I didn't bang my head, no, but I was at the, I was at the Wailing Wall.  They were so annoyed at David, they were so annoyed at David, by the end, they were just  making him, his job was to carry Star of David's into Palestine.  Here, just hand these out. 
[02:01:00]  He also got the word schmuck wrong.  Did he?  It's a, uh, it's a, you know, it's this, as I point down.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, and that's because it's a piece of, uh, you know what, when they do that thing  to the penis.  Yeah.  You see that?  Well, not really.  I don't think schmuck, uh, means that as much as, uh, like, um, schmeckle, right?  Or something.  Uh, schmuck is pretty much somebody who's, like, stupid.  Right.  It's like, don't be a schmuck.  I think a schmeckle is what, yeah, I think you're right. 
[02:01:30]  Schmeckle.  All right, the wax is ready, David.  Oh, no.  Uh, hold David.  No, I don't want to, just, no.  Wait, I can't hold the Jew?  No, you're not going to throw wax on me.  Why?  Do you see pictures of your trees?  Of your tree that you planted?  No, I haven't.  Do you have family over there that we can?  No, I don't have any family.  No family over there?  Not really, no.  Who'd you stay with?  Did you meet a nice girl?  It was just, it was a program.  Like, they had, we had, like, a, like, a dorm that you lived in for the first part, and  they, see, that's what I mean.  By 18, at 18 years old, I'm thinking your hormones are going, you send it away to, uh, Israel. 
[02:02:00]  Are there other people from, uh, the United States that are there with you?  Yeah, it was a program, an organized program.  And were there girls?  There were girls on the program, yeah.  So, now, did you, did you get, uh, uh, close with any of these girls?  Not really, no.  Why?  I don't know.  That seems like a good opportunity to, you know.  Yeah, but it was, yeah.  Like, that's one of those things where you're together, like a summer camp thing.  You always, guys get girls at a summer camp, or, you know, anytime you're together  and have something in common, which is, you know, you're, you're in Israel together, 
[02:02:30]  uh, you hook up and kind of take care of each other.  That would have been a good opportunity for you to lose, maybe, your virginity.  It would have been.  Yeah.  Did you like anyone?  Was there a girl there that you liked, maybe, a little bit?  Not really, no.  No?  No.  Too Jewish?  Don't worry about Opie's making the stretch for his spot sign, like, this very second.  We can continue after the break.  But, I know, but David's like, I'm asking for one more answer I was trying to get, and  he's just staring at you.  Thanks, I'm wondering what he's doing.  He thinks a plane is landing. 
[02:03:00]  What are you doing?  Don't worry, it's not some secret Catholic signal.  Running the show, idiot.  I'm going to answer Anthony's questions so we can do a couple commercials.  That's all right.  We'll go to break, but, uh, yeah, so many unanswered questions with David.  My God, is he, uh...  We'll continue with David in a minute.  We will.  Oh, uh, David and Israel, thank you.  Thanks for listening all the way over there.  Take it, boys.  All right.  Punch it out.  Ah, shalom.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, da-da-da-da-da. 
[02:03:30]  Hanging with intern David.  A quickie.  Someone in this room, their last day is Friday, and we'll finally reveal who's leaving the  show on Friday, I guess.  Wow.  We're hanging with intern David.  And, uh, Jimmy brought in a lot of his old clothes, right?  Like a...  How do you say the word?  Kango?  Garbage.  Kango hat?  Kango hats are okay.  Yeah, Kango hat.  Then you got something that Rich Vasa bought you, some kind of Italian, like, uh...  Sweatsuit top.  It's baby blue with a white, like, V kind of stripe, and it says Italia on it. 
[02:04:00]  And it's...  Yeah.  It's horrid.  It sucks.  It looks like someone of, like, Seinfeld's old relatives would be wearing it in an episode  where they were in Florida.  And he's got the Kango hat on, and then he's got...  Is that your leather jacket, an old leather jacket, too?  Oh, yeah, it is.  I got rid of it.  The Kango hat's fine, but the leather jacket's...  And I told Anthony that he looks like he should be at LaGuardia Airport, you know, driving  people illegally.  In those illegal cabs.  Right.  He looks exactly like one of those guys.  Here in New York, they have this...  If you go to LaGuardia, I believe it's LaGuardia Airport, they have a huge poster that says, 
[02:04:30]  don't take a ride from these guys, and they're stereotypical illegal drivers, kind of dressed  like David is dressed.  And the funny thing is, when you see these posters at LaGuardia Airport, the illegal drivers  that look just like the poster guys are standing right next to the poster.  Yeah, going, you need the ride.  Yeah.  You need the ride.  They're cheap, though, man.  They're good, and they get you to New York quickly.  Yeah, but they're, you know, you're not insured.  No, whatever.  You're in danger. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  Maybe a rapist.  Yeah.  Intern David.  That's funny.  I just was motioning to David, because his mic was a little low.  Yeah.  So I wanted him to raise it so it's closer to his mouth.  So I motioned as Oprah was talking, like, up.  Yeah.  And I did that, and he actually straightened up his shoulders.  He stood up.  His posture got better.  Yeah.  And then I fixed the jacket.  I didn't know.  Could someone remind me tomorrow, I understand the plight of the black man.  Really?  Well, I played Tiger Woods 09 online, and I decided to be a black dude online.  You made your avatar a black guy?  Yeah, a major black dude. 
[02:05:30]  Really?  And the racism, because, you know, people, like, hook up the audio.  And instead of saying, nice shot, it's nice shot.  The racism is brutal.  And I, you know, and I...  So in the virtual world, you know what it's like to be a black man.  Absolutely.  Living in this country.  Absolutely.  Okay.  I start getting mad.  I'm like, oh, yeah, wait a minute.  I'm white in real life.  Well, after next week, they'll be going, nice shot, Mr. President. 
[02:06:00]  That's right.  Yeah.  It's all going to be over.  Danny's got something for intern David.  David.  You want to play something for him?  Sure.  David, will you listen closely and tell us what you think of what Danny's going to play for you?  Yes, I will.  All right.  Very good.  This is a song called Mogos Robich Domovon.  It's been In My Country There Is A Problem.  In my country there is a problem. 
[02:06:30]  Good so far, right?  Throw transport down the well.  There's nothing wrong with it yet.  No.  So my country can be free.  So my country can be free.  We must make travel easy.  Then we have a big party. 
[02:07:00]  In my country there is a problem.  And that problem is the Jew.  How about that?  They take everybody's money.  They never give it back.  Throw the Jew down the well.  So my country can be free.  So my country can be free.  You must have been by his hands. 
[02:07:30]  Then we have a big party.  That's funny.  If you see the Jew coming.  He's a funny guy.  You must be careful of his teeth.  His teeth?  See?  You must grab him by his money.  And I tell you what to do.  Everybody, throw the Jew down the well.  So my country can be free.  So my country can be free. 
[02:08:00]  You must grab him by his hands.  You must have been by his hands.  Then we have a big party.  And we'll have a big party.  Throw the Jew down the well.  So my country can be free.  So my country can be free.  What do you think, David?  It's a nice, catchy song, huh?  Yeah, he's a funny guy.  Do you know who that is?  Yeah, Borat.  Of course.  Borat.  He's a funny guy.  He's Jewish himself.  The actor is Jewish himself.  He is.  Absolutely.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
[02:08:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Ron, it was out of Meteor.  What was that?  I heard pound, pound, pound.  No, it was a, he couldn't be any Meteor.  I know, because as soon as Opie said, this is a funny people, Iraq ran to grab the list.  Yeah, I know, David.  Ah, David's great.  Listen, the moment might have passed, but we're going to try it anyway. 
[02:09:00]  Frank in New York, go ahead.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  David, my David, are you more upset about them misusing that candle because they threw it  on a fat pig, Iraq?  Ah, see, because, uh, poor.  It's not exactly kosher.  Yeah.  It's just a fat, sacred pig.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh, right?  I don't know.  I'm just upset.  I'm just, like, upset because it was a yardside candle.  It was a Jewish object.  I don't know.  Let's, uh, what's this list of funny people, David? 
[02:09:30]  We've got to get to the list.  All right, on to a new subject.  Intern David's list of funniest people.  Funniest people.  It's not funniest people.  No, no, no, no.  It's a ranking of all the ONA staff members, and they're ranking from least funniest to  most funniest.  Why'd you write it?  It's only ONA people.  Why'd you write it?  I didn't write it.  I just came up with it.  Uh, just, it was something that we thought would be a funny thing to do.  Can David read it?  Yeah.  I would love to.  David?  No.  Oh, do we want him to start with the funniest person?  Are we starting with the funniest or the least funniest?  Start with the funniest person involved. 
[02:10:00]  Has everybody seen this?  This is, this is, this is everybody involved with the ONA show, whether peripherally or  Anyone that's involved, yeah.  Yes, anyone that's involved.  And it's only them, yes.  Funniest.  From most funniest to least funniest.  Okay.  Start with the funniest person involved with the O.B. and Anthony show.  Who is that, David?  The funniest of all is Jimmy.  Jimmy Norton.  And I have to say, this is according to me, not anybody else.  This is me.  All right.  This is according to God's law. 
[02:10:30]  Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Norton gets funny number one.  I love this kid.  He's the most funniest.  I have no problem with that.  Thank you.  Not most funniest is completely grammatically incorrect, but I'll forgive you.  It's the funniest.  The funniest.  Most funniest.  The funniest.  There's not going to be much arguing about that, but the second name, there's going to  be a lot of arguing about it.  All right.  Number two.  All right.  Let me get ready for a bow.  Of course you should.  I actually would disagree with number one.  I would have given it to him.  No.  All right.  You're going to disagree with yourself?  As much as I appreciate the compliment. 
[02:11:00]  I totally contended.  Will you shut up?  Anthony's ready to stand up.  I like that.  As second funniest person on the Opie and Anthony show.  Second funniest.  Make it official, David.  Second funniest.  Second funniest.  David.  Club Soda Kenny.  What?  What?  Why?  Club Soda Kenny.  Here comes Kenny.  It's number two.  Take a bow.  Kenny's all smiles.  Club Soda Kenny.  The second funniest person on the Opie and Anthony show.  This is my acceptance speech.  Thank you, everyone, for making me funny. 
[02:11:30]  Wow.  Good call, David.  David, it goes from Jimmy Norton to Club Soda Kenny.  He's a funny man.  Why is he a funny man?  He's a funny man.  He writes me a lot of funny bits.  Oh, now I see why.  He's funny.  He collaborates with David on his sports name.  Yeah, and he's very, very funny.  So, that's why he picked...  He's basically giving his writer...  His writer, he's giving him props.  When we're in the office there, he's always making me laugh.  Yeah, and I'm a Jew. 
[02:12:00]  That's...  Yes, you are.  See, look at this.  They all stick together.  The Jew.  Number three.  They're all the Jew down the well.  You love that poor rat, don't you?  Oh, he's...  Wa-wa-wee-wa.  Yes, I do.  I love that voice.  All right, Kenny.  We got to move along.  There's a lot of names.  Oh, sorry.  David's right.  Sorry, David.  You're right, David.  Absolutely right.  Oh, he's not too pushy, is he?  Not too controlling, huh?  Number three. 
[02:12:30]  Number three.  Number three, Anthony.  Oh, right.  I'm right under Club Soda Kenny.  Yes.  That's a good spot to be.  Yes.  Fantastic.  You're right below...  How do you feel about being number three, Anthony?  You're right below the guy that gets his breakfast every morning.  Yeah.  That's good.  Not too good, to tell you the truth.  Oh, not too good.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Grabbing the old bronze in this event.  Well, I got to see who you just beat out.  Yes.  Who did I just edge out at number four?  Number four would be Opie. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, okay.  Opie.  Opie gets number four.  Very good.  Good way.  Nice.  Who did Opie just ease out?  Yeah.  Ease out.  Number five would be Sam Roberts.  Sam?  Yes.  Let me think.  Are you sarcastic?  Funny.  Funniest.  That's very difficult to...  All right.  All right.  What am I to say?  Okay.  And then?  Who's funny?  And then who's after Sam?  After Sam would be Roland. 
[02:13:30]  Roland?  Yeah, he's very funny.  What are you, Roland?  Right.  David, look.  Why are you pouring water?  That's terrible.  He's wasting water.  And he's pouring it all over the wax that was on the floor.  Hi-yo.  Roland, why'd you do all that?  They're starving children.  They're starving children in Africa, and he's wasting water.  Roland, why'd you pour water?  Do you eat it?  Are you from the 60s?  Let Roland talk.  Roland?  Because he always gets upset every time I pour water.  Stop that.  He's wasting water.  There's starving children in Africa that could be drinking that.  What, are they going to eat water? 
[02:14:00]  They could be drinking water.  Then they're thirsty.  If they can't afford bread, let them eat dirt and flies.  David, what's wrong with pouring water?  That's terrible.  You're wasting someone, some thirsty person could drink that, and you're wasting it.  That's terrible.  That really is.  That's terrible.  Don't waste water.  That's terrible.  I'm thirsty.  He really freaks out when you pour water on the floor.  There are people around the world that have no water at all, and they could be drinking that.  Well, they're bums, David.  We deserve it.  That's the one thing we'll not run out of.  This country is full of water.  The planet's 75% water, David. 
[02:14:30]  And they know how to get the salt out of it and everything.  That's right.  We have enough water.  Except in those crappy countries.  We'll be all right with water.  We can waste a few.  In the Middle East.  For all the beautiful Americans.  And there was also, yesterday, on Friday, Opie brought in some food, like some bagels  and some danishes, and Roland proceeded to pick them up and just throw them away.  Yeah, he did.  He did.  Well, they were awful.  So if they were awful, if they were awful, then just don't eat one.  They'll throw it away.  I brought them in, Roland.  I.  He was wasting your food, Opie.  Well, they were sitting around.  I didn't tell everyone. 
[02:15:00]  I just put, like, Saran wrap around to make it look fresh.  They were sitting around for, like, two days in my apartment.  That doesn't matter.  The point is that Roland was wasting food.  David, you should tell Roland this, because Roland...  I told him several times on Friday.  Well, you have to look at Roland.  Like, he's not too happy with that.  Roland, you're wasting food on Friday.  How dare you?  I know.  Mazel Tov.  When the KKK puts up a picture of who they hate...  Come on!  Stop wasting water, Opie.  It has to be David.  Come on!  Like, it has to be his whole image and persona.  What? 
[02:15:30]  All right, should we get to the next person on the funny list?  Oh, is that why I'm getting shocked?  Yes.  Oh.  Oh, would you pour water into, like, some under...  Yeah, there's wires under the...  Of course there are wires.  What do you think, they just magically disappear into the floor?  Oh, really?  I thought so.  I swear to God, I was getting shocked as I was pouring the water.  All right, go ahead, David.  All right, David.  I'm going to hear buzzing soon.  Okay, that was six.  We mop up the water before we get electrocuted.  Thank you.  Okay.  So, Roland was number six.  Roland's number six.  Okay, number seven.  Number seven would be Mars. 
[02:16:00]  No offense to Mars, but...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I've never heard him say anything funny.  Ever.  Or even acknowledge it.  He talks to me all the time, and he's pretty darn funny.  What does he say that's funny?  Just makes jokes and stuff.  Like, talks about me being Jewish, and he's always laughing and kidding around.  I have never heard Mars be funny.  I mean, I like Mars and everything.  He's always, like, making fun of, like, other people and the staff and making fun of them,  and he's very funny.  Oh, is he?  Hold on, excuse me.  This is the stuff we don't hear.  Hey, can you guys clean up that spill while David's on the air?  Go ahead, David.  Sorry.  Just keep it down, because David's doing a thing on the air today. 
[02:16:30]  Go ahead, David.  Yeah, so I was saying, like, Mars is always busy, like, in the background, like, making fun of  other people and stuff, and he's very funny when he does that.  All right.  Okay.  And then a guy named Ryan.  Who the hell's Ryan?  Yeah, Ryan would be number eight.  Oh, the guy mopping up the floor is a funny guy?  That guy is funny?  The guy mopping up the water is a funny guy.  I had no idea.  Well, I think after...  What is the top half and what is the bottom?  Like, where is the top half of the funny, and where does it get to the bottom half?  Whatever you say.  Oh, so now we're starting to get into the part where...  Like, Mars is funny. 
[02:17:00]  Everybody...  After Mars, like, these people are, like, getting less and less funnier.  Anything after Club Soda Kenny sucks.  No, you're after Club Soda Kenny.  You're funny.  You're hilarious.  No, but you put me after Club Soda Kenny.  It goes Jimmy Norton, who is hysterical.  You know what?  A big oaf.  You know what?  Maybe you should write your own list.  We can compare lists.  David's telling you, basically, to stop bitching.  Yeah, stop bitching.  Make your own list.  Yeah, David's going, this is my list.  Now stop bitching.  I'll make a list, all right.  Yeah, I was going to say.  How about everybody makes a list?  We compare lists.  Hey, all right. 
[02:17:30]  David, or other things.  Good boy.  We're just going to...  I'm going to get Steve from Bayshore, and he's going to help me make a list.  Yeah, I'm sure he would.  We're all going to make our own list, David.  And it's going to be enough of a funny people.  I wonder where I'm going to fall on everyone's lists.  Will you shut up?  All right.  So Ryan, who's mopping up the floor, is a funny guy.  Then Ron.  Who's Ron?  Ron, yeah.  Hip-hop.  Oh, hip-hop.  Hip-hop Ron.  Get him in here.  Yeah, he's...  One, two, three.  He's also mopping up the floor.  Ron, you...  He's number...  Ron is number nine.  Ron, you're number nine on David. 
[02:18:00]  This is...  No, I thought I would be lower, meaning that he doesn't like me, but I'll take that high.  Why doesn't he like you?  I don't know.  Me and him, we're becoming friends now.  Okay.  What do you find funny about hip-hop Ron?  He's a little bit funny, a little.  All right, see?  Now he's even going a little bit funny.  Yeah.  All right, so now the line is starting to be drawn like, these are people you don't really  find funny, but you've got to rank them.  Yeah.  So hip-hop Ron...  Like, the list was to rank every single person.  I have to put every single person on the list.  Yeah, exactly.  So Ron's a little funny, yeah. 
[02:18:30]  That's number nine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who's number ten?  Number ten would be Duffy, that is in Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  Yeah, sure.  Pat Duffy is number ten.  Yes.  And he's funny because he, like, eats weird stuff and...  He's funny, yeah, because he ate a bug once.  Yeah, yeah, we saw that.  So he's number ten.  Because he ate a bug once.  Okay, who's number eleven?  In the top ten, by the way, four of those people, we don't even pay.  No.  And now the guys...  More attention to.  And now the guys we do pay are below the top ten. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  That's going to make some of these guys happy.  Some people that get paid are below interns that get unpaid.  Correct.  Okay.  All right.  Correct.  You got it.  Number eleven.  So eleven would be Travis.  Travis comes in at number eleven.  All right.  Travis beats out Erock, Danny, Derek, Steve, Stunt Brain.  That's right.  Travis.  Travis.  I'm hilarious.  Travis is very funny.  See, I beat out Danny.  I think Travis should have been a lot higher on the list, to be honest with you.  At least ten.  He should have been where Clubstone Kenny was, right, Ant? 
[02:19:30]  Well, maybe not that high.  Okay, who's after Travis?  Number twelve would be Erock.  Erock.  Erock.  Erock.  Yes.  I've never heard Erock not even be funny.  That's why he's on the bottom.  But tell an interesting story.  Yeah, but I mean, I'm just saying that because, yeah, that's why he's on the bottom.  But there are people's names who haven't come up yet.  Can I tell you something about Erock, too?  You say you've never heard him be...  He's never even attempted to be funny.  No.  No, I think he has. 
[02:20:00]  Like, he hasn't even attempted that.  I think he's tried to tell humorous anecdotes.  Yeah.  And they just come out horribly.  Uh, Danny?  Eric's only been funny, like, unintentionally.  Right.  Like, when he says that his teeth hurt after he gets, you know, punched in the chest for  some reason.  When his refrigerated door fell off.  Yeah.  Like, that's funny.  He's visually funny.  Yeah.  Hurry up.  Who else we got now after Erock?  We have thirteen.  Thirteenth?  Yes, thirteen funny is Danny.  Now, Danny finally comes in.  Now, you don't find Danny funnier than Erock or Travis or... 
[02:20:30]  Or Mars.  Or Mars.  Mars is hilarious.  You guys don't...  Or interns that mop the floor for a living.  No, no.  You guys don't see what goes on in the background.  It's crazy, right?  Mars is funny.  Mars is hilarious.  There's a lot of nutty stuff behind Sirius.  Yes.  I can't wait to get an example of his humor in a while here.  Danny, you should see Mars when he can't fix all the equipment over at XM.  It does make us laugh.  I'm always laughing at him.  It's true.  All right.  Mars is a funny guy.  Then you got...  So, number fourteen on the list would be Derek. 
[02:21:00]  Derek is number fourteen.  I've never heard that guy say one funny thing.  You're right.  Holy Jesus.  Derek could be one of the funniest guys I know.  He's insane.  Like, he's crazy.  You get a few in him, which is every day.  Whenever I interact with Derek, he's always mad.  Always mad, right?  He's always mad about something.  Like, oh, my food was too expensive.  Oh, oh, oh.  David's list so far is aces.  And David is now to the point where these guys are not funny whatsoever, but he just  has to list them.  Every time I interact with Derek, he's mad. 
[02:21:30]  He sucks.  All right, David.  You're right.  Next person.  Number fifteen on the list is Butcher.  Exactly.  Butcher's not funny.  What's he funny?  He stinks.  Butcher's not funny at all.  No, no, no.  He's horrible.  Great list.  He's always doing some stuff I don't like what he does.  Just nonsense.  I don't like what he does, no.  Like what?  I don't like what he does.  Like what?  He's just annoying.  He's annoying.  He's annoying.  He's annoying, yeah.  He annoys me sometimes.  Bless you.  What's he do that's annoying?  Bless you.  What's he do that's annoying?  I don't know.  He's just something about him.  He's always, like, moaning and groaning about things. 
[02:22:00]  Like, oh, go get me this.  Do this.  Do this.  Oh, go away.  He's always moaning and groaning.  He's telling me to get out of his way all the time.  But he's to get out of his way.  But he's not.  Exactly.  All right.  The pendulum there.  Yeah, see, I just had to make sure I was still the more.  Go ahead.  You're still number one, Jimmy.  You always will be on my list.  All right.  Even if there's new people that come to the work here, you'll still be number one.  Thank you, David.  What if it's somebody?  Ah, whatever.  Even if there's a new person that's really funny, Jimmy, you'll still be one.  All right.  Okay, next.  So that was number 16 on the list would be Steve. 
[02:22:30]  Wow.  Wow, man.  Out of how many?  Did you make a list of good producers here?  No, I didn't say.  I'm not saying he's not a good producer.  This is not at all what I'm saying.  Yeah, we understand.  But that's a joke.  And I guess you don't really know funny.  The number one on your list just made a funny.  He did.  All right.  Okay.  So Steve's number 16.  Congratulations, Steve.  Out of 18.  Thank you, Jim.  I had you lower.  16, I have 18.  Out of 18.  That's not even good if it's out of 100.  I think this list was written exactly one week after I lambasted him and almost sent 
[02:23:00]  him home crying.  Oh, 17.  Because if he did, he'd be way higher.  No, he's 16.  Yeah, I know.  He should drop it on to that.  I'd at least be one higher.  Steve actually knew where I'd be higher on the list.  All right.  Now, who beat out Steve?  Who didn't beat out Steve?  Number 17 would be Stunt Brain.  Stunt Brain's below Steve.  But he's not the last on the list.  No.  No.  Wow.  You didn't make last on the list.  That's good.  But he is a lump. 
[02:23:30]  You're the second most unfunny person associated with this show.  Yeah.  Including interns that mop the floor.  Who's the last one?  It's got to be Master Poe.  The last one is Master Poe.  Master Poe.  All right.  Anyone arguing?  No.  Master Poe is the least on the list because he's not funny.  We have an interesting story about Master Poe.  Oh.  Well, David.  It's your radio show.  Do tell, David.  Do tell.  Oh, boy, David.  W-J-E-W.  Yes.  Go ahead.  On Friday, Sam Roberts.  The Sabbath.  Sam Roberts proceeded to show Master Poe that he was last on the list. 
[02:24:00]  And this is a quote.  This was Master Poe's response when he found that he was last on the list.  Do the impression.  Do it like Master Poe.  Go ahead.  Oh, okay.  I'm quoting Master Poe.  Of course we know that.  Okay.  Okay, Master Poe, look.  You're last on the list.  Oh, that's good that I'm last.  That's good that I'm last on the list.  Know why?  Because I'm not paid here to be funny.  I'm paid to look at everybody here.  I'm not paid to be funny.  That was his response.  Well, where's the funny part?  Can I pencil in someone under Poe? 
[02:24:30]  That was his response.  That's not me.  That's it.  That's it.  That's not you.  Master Poe said, of course I'm not funny.  I'm not supposed to be funny.  I'm supposed to watch you guys and stare at you guys all day.  I think the issue, David, was that you put that under the umbrella of interesting stories.  Right.  Yes, yes.  See, that was what...  He was explaining the fact that he was proud of being last.  He said, of course, on that.  But he's not a funny guy.  No, he was acknowledging the fact that he wasn't funny.  Right, but he thinks he shouldn't be.  He thinks he shouldn't be funny.  He's not supposed to be funny.  David, where would you say, on that list, between any people there, do you fit? 
[02:25:00]  Me?  Yeah.  Put yourself in there somewhere.  Don't be humble, David.  Yeah.  Don't be humble.  Be completely honest.  Yeah.  Assess yourself.  Assess the people on the list.  Yeah.  And throw yourself in there between a couple of Gentiles.  Yeah, I'm looking.  I'm looking.  Facing places.  Where would you put yourself on the list?  Right after Ho.  I'll see.  I'm funnier than Poe.  Yes.  Sun Prane.  Yes.  Eve Butcher.  Travis.  Yeah.  We're not.  No.  Don't be shy.  I'm pretty funny.  You are very funny.  I'm not that funny, though. 
[02:25:30]  All right.  So he's going up the list, but then he goes down a little and goes, I'm not that funny,  but I'm funnier than this.  All right.  Where would you put yourself?  Hurry.  We've got to end the show.  Okay.  Yeah.  I think I'd be in between Ryan and Ron, I would put myself.  Really?  Yes.  Between Ryan and Ron.  And that would make you.  One, two, three, four, five.  That would make you funnier than Duffy, Travis, Erick, Danny, Derek, Booker, Steve, Stunt Brain,  and Poe.  Top ten.  We'd be in top ten.  Nine, yes.  I agree.  Funnier than Danny.  Nine, yes.  Yeah.  Funnier than Danny.  All right.  Listen, we could do this all day, but we're already 15 minutes late. 
[02:26:00]  We have to leave.  We've got Tracy Lords calling in, I think.  Hopefully, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  From Zack and Miriam Make a Porno, which, by the way, is giving us $1,000 to give away  tomorrow.  Tomorrow's the big pole dancing contest, Nick.  Yes.  We've been looking forward to this, haven't we, guys?  Oh, haven't we?  Unbelievable.  It's not too late to register.  Go to onaradio.com for a chance to come to the show and pole dance tomorrow.  You're going to win $1,000 if you're the best, and you take the pole home with you.  And we're not helping you, by the way.  You're going to have to drag that thing down the street.  Get it out yourself. 
[02:26:30]  Right.  I don't care what you use to latch onto it and pull it down the street.  That'd be a talent.  All thanks to the new film.  Zack and Miriam Make a Porno.  Kevin Smith's hilarious new comedy, which I saw, and it's very funny.  Seth Rogen is just a star, man.  Just a star.  Yep.  It's about best friends who fall on hard times, and they decide, well, to get out of  debt, they're going to make a porno.  Yes.  Hence the title.  So go check it out.  It's in theaters Friday.  All right.  All right.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:27:00]  Funny.  Den, den, den.  Den, den, den.  We continue with the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's acknowledge Chris Jericho in studio, but we've got to blow you off for a minute,  although you can help us out with the interview.  Yeah.  No pun intended.  You're going to blow me off for Tracy Lourdes.  We've got Tracy Lourdes on the phone.  She's been sitting there for like 10 or 15 minutes.  Tracy.  Hello.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  How are you guys?  Sorry to make you wait.  We're doing very well.  We remember you when we were at N.E.W.  You came in and talked to us. 
[02:27:30]  I know.  Many moons ago.  And we were all, we're kind of happy you're not in studio.  I know.  It took me weeks to mop up the drool.  We get very nervous in front of pretty girls.  It was very cute.  We're terrible like that.  That's what we want to hear from a hot girl.  Oh, you're so cute.  Now, we were talking to Kevin Smith, of course.  Fantastic director, Kevin Smith, and close personal friend of ours.  Now, did you guys get to see the movie? 
[02:28:00]  Yes.  Yes.  What did you think?  I liked the movie a lot.  This is my favorite Kevin Smith movie, and I'm a huge fan of his, and I'm glad I'm in  this one, but this one I think is really, really cool.  You know what's great about Kevin?  It's like, as a fan, you watch his movies and then go, I'd love to be in a Kevin Smith  movie.  And I think eventually, you just end up in it.  Just ask him.  Jimmy, our friend Jimmy Norton here, he's on our show.  He's in it.  He's in the same movie you're in.  What does he play?  Co-stars.  I haven't seen it yet.  I almost got cut out, but I think Kevin just felt like being polite and kept me in. 
[02:28:30]  I was, uh...  He's part of the montage, Tracy, of guys that are auditioning to be in the porno.  Oh, okay.  Are you like, are you a hairy man?  Or what is your disability?  Um, I'm...  What's your disability?  I'm, uh...  I have a crew cut, kind of a fat boyish face.  I'm charming.  Like, I'm sure you saw me and you probably went, aww, and then I was off the screen.  What filthy line did he make you say? 
[02:29:00]  I don't know.  I actually wrote my own.  Kevin asked me to write them, so I wrote them.  Yeah.  Great.  So what was one of the lines that you said?  I don't remember.  We sat there.  I did a bunch of them.  Look at you.  I don't remember.  Oh, gosh.  It was creepy.  It was like a creepy line.  It was just all of the most unlikely people ever saying the filthiest things directly into  camera.  They're auditioning for the movie that we're making.  And it's hilarious.  I think I'm actually in the scene with, uh, what was it?  It's Seth Rogen.  And who's the woman that stars in it? 
[02:29:30]  Elizabeth Banks.  Yeah, but they weren't there when I shot it, so I think they just kind of, uh, cut together.  It was people auditioning to be in this porno they're making.  Yeah.  Well, what happens is it's these two friends, Seth and Elizabeth, play Zach and Mary, and  they're down and down and out and living in Pittsburgh, and their power goes off in the  winter, and, you know, they just have this really crappy lives, and they're trying to  figure out a way to dig themselves out of this whole kind of timely with the economy  the way it is at the moment.  But anyway, so they, uh, they go through this list of things they can do to make money,  and the last thing on their list is that they're going to make their own sex tape. 
[02:30:00]  And these are, you know, they live across the street from the high school that they  went to, and they start recruiting people around town thinking that if nobody else buys  our porno, at least our classmates will, because everybody's curious about what their classmates  did.  So they go to make this porno, and they do kind of a hilarious job of it.  And it's just about this group of misfits that get together to make this movie, and what  happens to them in this little kind of family tribe that they end up building.  And a bunch of things go wrong, and they get it right in the end, and wackiness ensues. 
[02:30:30]  A lot of...  I'm trying to roll the bubbles, and I just, all I can tell you about her, because I don't  want to give it away, is that I have an incredible control over every muscle in my body.  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  And I'm hoping that people don't expect me to be able to perform this trick at real,  you know, Bachelor Park.  Oh, really?  Was it uncomfortable for you dealing with this theme?  Because I know that Kevin said that you agreed to kind of be involved with it and read the  script, because you liked him, and you liked Seth Rogen.  Was it uncomfortable for you, like, dealing with this theme after all these years, or 
[02:31:00]  did you feel there's time?  It was a really strange call to get, because I had just had my baby.  He was two months old.  And I had my baby on one boob, and the phone in the other.  On the other boob?  Yep.  He's having breakfast.  And my manager called me and said, the good news is Kevin Smith wants you to do the movie.  The bad news is it's called Zack and Mary Make Porno, and I kind of went, oh, my.  And she said, go meet with him and talk to him. 
[02:31:30]  And I met with him, and I sat in his living room, and I read the script, and it made me  laugh out loud.  I was like, tears were running down my face.  Oh, well, well.  This is really hilarious.  And then I thought, okay, you know, how am I going to go and do this?  There's a scene where my character's, like, topless in the movie, and I thought, well,  Kevin, that's really cool and everything, but I'm lactating right now, so I don't think  I'm going to be up for all that.  I never thought I'd say this to you, Tracy, but we don't really need your boobs.  Yeah.  I never thought I'd hear the day that Tracy Lord said she was lactating. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, my God.  It's killing the dream.  Hey, are you surprised, by the way, the way the reaction?  It's amazing.  Like, you've been out of it for so many years, and now they won't put the word porno  in half the ads, and the TV shows are just calling it Zack and Miri because the NFL won't  advertise it.  Are you surprised?  Really?  People are so flipped out about the stupidest stuff, the dirtiest thing, like crass or vulgar  or whatever.  It's a fun, grown-up comedy, but porno is just a word that scares the heck out of everybody. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  And you know what?  It doesn't surprise me.  When they told me that the title was going to stick, because you never know if something's  a working title or if it's going to end up being that.  But when they told me that was going to stick, I thought, well, there's going to be places  like Salt Lake City, like whatever, where people are just going to be freaked out, let  alone they go and they air something like Saw.  You know, so let's just go cut everybody up and dismember them, but God forbid you say  something about sex.  That's a story in the paper today.  That's so stupid.  They're not showing it in these Utah theaters. 
[02:33:00]  There's this asshole who's got this thing about sex who won't show the...  That's going to make people want to see it that much more.  Yeah, we have no problem with showing violence, you know, as much violence as you want, but  the second sex works its way into something, oh, everyone freaks out.  You know, it's a bummer, too, because it's such a good time to laugh.  There's not a lot of comedies.  There certainly aren't a lot of good comedies.  I mean, and people want an escape.  It's the perfect movie for that.  I hope that it's not dismissed because of that. 
[02:33:30]  It's just dumb.  Yeah.  Tracy, Anthony, wow, he just really enjoyed Zack and Miriam.  Oh, yeah.  Everybody that was with me.  Yeah.  I love that.  It was great.  Why don't you tell Tracy your favorite part of the movie?  Oh, God.  It had to be probably...  Well, I'm a little biased, so when Jimmy was on the screen, I was laughing a lot at that.  Nice.  I like that.  Yeah, but Jimmy was only on for about five to ten seconds.  And then, like you said, I won't give it away, but your trick there is very interesting. 
[02:34:00]  And when they made the porno, it was cool.  Yeah, yeah.  Anytime, you know, they were doing that.  The whole awkwardness of the whole thing was very funny.  Were you shocked by the scene that people will be talking about?  Oh, hell yeah.  I'm surprised.  After they see the movie on Friday?  And I know that Kevin had a hard time getting that past the ratings.  You want to, like, hint at what the scene was all about?  Let's just say, ready, aim, fire.  That's all I'm going to say.  You know, I know what scene you're talking about. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  Say she knows, Ed.  The whole set just went, ugh!  Really?  That's what we thought, too.  I can't wait to see it.  Was that your reaction, Ed?  Yes, it was.  When did you see the movie again?  I forgot.  Oh, I saw it when, uh, it was right after you saw it, as a matter of fact.  Right, exactly.  Hey, uh, Tracy, Jimmy's lines in the movie were,  Cradle the balls, work the shaft.  Oh, I know exactly who you are.  I know exactly who you are.  I don't know if I wrote that one or not.  But that's the one that made it, because we got a guy that's seen the movie twice already. 
[02:35:00]  Was that a line in the movie, or just you walking around the set?  That's what Kevin said to me as I was auditioning.  It was brilliant, too, because it's so deadpan.  And there's nothing sexy about it.  Of course.  Right, tremendous.  Of course, the ball works the shaft.  Thank you.  Tracy, I feel good that she remembers it, and bad that she's like,  it was so unsexy, it was perfect.  Sorry.  That's all right.  It's good to see you embracing your past just a little bit here,  because I remember when we talked to you at N.E.W., and man, they sat us down. 
[02:35:30]  She doesn't want to talk about her past, blah, blah, blah.  But that's what the publicist is supposed to do.  Yeah, yeah.  But to see you, uh, you know, kind of having fun with this whole, uh, porno thing was, it was good.  It was nice.  Well, it has been kind of two decades now, hasn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah, I understand.  Hey, were you, like, when you look back on it, like, all that happened and stuff like that,  do you feel, like, a sense of, like, is it shame or anger or sadness?  Or, like, what is it that hits you when you think of those days?  You know, when I think of it now, I think, wow, that's what I did when I was in high school.  Yeah, just think of what it would be like.  Like, think back to your high school days, and it seems like a thousand years ago. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you.  You know, you had...  Like, wow, that's what I was doing in high school.  So much other stuff going on.  You know, my parents.  Yeah, right?  What is...  This might be an ignorant question, because you and I are close in age, and so when I was  in high school, obviously, I was a tremendous fan.  What exactly blew it up?  What exactly ended the whole thing?  How did people find out that you were not...  You were underage?  You know, I don't know.  To this day, I don't know.  I think that there was just a lot of...  There was a lot of smoke.  I think a lot of people knew something that was... 
[02:36:30]  Something was off.  So, I have no idea how it ultimately, you know, came out.  I just remember the knock on my door.  Oh, boy.  And was that the police?  Yeah, and they always come really early in the morning.  I don't know.  They have to be like radio guys or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They have to crack it on.  I'd rather have a cop than a radio guy come to the door to tell you the truth.  Yeah.  You know, I'm not sure which I'd prefer.  I hate radio guys.  Do you have any affection or friends for people from those days, or any people that 
[02:37:00]  you're still close with from back in the day, like Tom Byron or any of those guys?  No.  It's like living in a whole other world.  One of the funny things that happened, because we had the premiere out here at the Man's Chinese  like last week, and then we had the press junket, and one of the things that people were  asking is, what would your porn name be?  Which made me laugh, because I thought, well...  Tracy Lords.  But then I thought about it, and I thought, actually, my porn name would be Fluffy Vanderbilt.  See, because you've got to use your pet and where you live. 
[02:37:30]  And the first street that you lived on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you...  But I thought, you know, maybe that's a good alias.  Fluffy Vanderbilt?  So now that I'm traveling, I'm going to start staying under, I think, Fluffy Vanderbilt.  I guess I just told the world, didn't I?  Well, at least you're not...  Oh, Gavin, what was yours?  Mine was...  It would have been...  My cat's name was John.  And I lived on Fox Road, so it would be John Fox.  I was Joe Wordsworth.  That works, though.  That's not bad, Joe.  Joe Wadsworth would be better.  I would say.  That's it.  That's not good, actually. 
[02:38:00]  That's me, Joe Wadsworth.  I lived on Main Street, so Fresca, Maine.  Fresca, Maine?  That sounds like a girl, though.  That sounds like a girl, though.  Fresca?  Yeah.  We like to name our pets after bad soda.  Soft drinks.  Mine would have been Champ Elwood.  Really?  Champ Elwood.  That's great.  Champ.  We've got a couple good names here.  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  I want to hear more about the lactating myself. 
[02:38:30]  Jeez.  Opie has a fetish for pregnancy.  I'm the hole here.  Gee, Opie.  Because it's the opportunity you have to, in my case, really use them for good and not evil.  Yeah.  You know?  It's just like, wow.  The most amazing thing about being pregnant is all of a sudden I had Pamela Anderson's breast.  Really?  The most amazing thing about it is that they didn't stay.  Oh, no, huh?  You just fill those puppies up.  Well, you've always looked very good, I must say.  Yeah, I mean, I survived the whole thing very well.  Yeah.  And I'm an amazing little person. 
[02:39:00]  But still, the magnificent giant boobs.  That was kind of cool.  It is cool, too.  You know, you transcended all that crap and were able to, you know, make a legit career and everything.  A lot of people don't get that opportunity.  Yeah, you went, didn't you go to, like, the Strasburg Institute, like, right after, when you turned 18?  I did.  I did, yeah.  1986 or 87.  I was out here in L.A. and I was studying at the Strasburg Theater.  And then I booked my first job out of there.  And it was actually kind of funny because, you know, you take yourself very seriously.  At least I did. 
[02:39:30]  You were talking about a couple years ago, I even took myself very seriously.  But at that time, I really did.  And, you know, I was booked to do this Roger Corman film.  And this guy in sunglasses chased me through Griffith Park.  And he was supposed to be an alien.  And here I was trying to channel my, you know, emotional well.  It was pretty ridiculous.  That's my motivation.  There's a fucking alien chasing you.  That's my motivation.  Run.  Great.  They're paying you scale.  You can pay your rent.  That's my motivation.  That's the motivation is paying a bill.  Hey, Tracy, what do you think of today's porns? 
[02:40:00]  You know, it's funny because I have, in my DVD play right now, I have Baby Einstein.  So I can't do wrong.  All right.  Well, that's what I think, too.  I have a one-year-old.  I'm Uncle Paul.  It's like singing elephants.  Wait.  She said you have a one-year-old with...  I didn't hear that last line.  I said I have a one-year-old, so it's singing elephants.  That's what I have in my TV.  Oh, kids have...  I mean, just regular sex when you have a baby is like...  That's like...  That's pretty wild.  Hey, do you find... 
[02:40:30]  Oh, my God.  You're right, Ed.  Kids ruin everything.  Tracy Lewis isn't having sex because she has a kid.  How is this possible?  Well, you know, you really master the art of the quickie when you have a one-year-old.  Oh, never know when they're going to pop on in.  Well, no, you just never know when they're going to start screaming or like that for me.  Just killing everything for me.  Come on, honey, you ready?  Mount me.  Mount me.  Okay, go.  You never know when the kid's going to scream or the guy.  Well, exactly.  Yeah.  Hey, do you find any of them like...  Because, you know, do you find any porno sexy or because you were there, it's all kind 
[02:41:00]  of like just...  Not even gross, just like uneventful to you.  Well, to me, it's like...  Porno is kind of like being the puppeteer backstage at the puppet show.  You know where all the strings are and stuff.  And so it's just kind of like, oh, yeah, I know how they rigged that.  So it's...  Yeah, it's kind of...  The thrill is gone, I guess I could say.  It's not really hot.  I watched them shoot a couple because I was involved with the AVN Awards and I got... 
[02:41:30]  How was that?  It was weird.  It was very technical.  Like, it was on the set of a Jenna Jameson movie, so it was like any other film.  There's craft services and there's, you know, there's a wardrobe area.  And then I got to see like a really low budget and a medium budget.  And there was parts of it that were very sexy, but it was also so technical.  And the director was barking out orders.  I'm like, wow, it really isn't as hot when you're watching it in person.  It's much more like a business or anything else to be shot.  Yeah, see, I don't think that's all sexy.  I think like Zalman King is sexy.  I thought Nine and a Half Weeks was sexy. 
[02:42:00]  I think that kind of stuff, that's hot.  I don't know, maybe that's a female perspective.  But those are the filmmakers I think are sexy, hot.  Some close-up of like organs and blah, blah, blah.  Not so hot.  I thought Anal Intruder was pretty sexy.  What?  Is he Opie?  The theme movies never got me, though, to be honest with you.  I like the old stuff with the stories.  And, you know, it's like the more they go on, the more they've just gone to these quick clips.  Right, just sexy.  Yeah, and it really, that's why I tend to like a hardcore rated R movie or something or NC-17. 
[02:42:30]  Like those Emanuel's on Showtime when I was a teenager.  I can't tell you how fantastic they were.  Yeah, so you like like Zalman King-ish stuff, too.  I don't know who that is, but if it's like, if it's anything like the Emanuels, like Black  Emanuel, where they're in the African Safari, and they were just touching each other gingerly  on the forearm, and you're like, oh, she's touching her.  But maybe that's because it was 30 years ago.  He's like a girl.  Listen to him.  Yeah, he is.  Hell yeah, I'm a fruit.  Jimmy is a little bitch.  Yeah, and then the man from Zimbabwe with the good chest walked in. 
[02:43:00]  I'm creeping myself out.  I got to jump, but...  All right, on that note.  Yeah, on that note.  Joe Norton.  Yes, the movie.  Opens on Friday.  I hope you guys will tell your friends.  Absolutely.  Very funny.  Great scene.  Did Norton scare off Tracy Lourdes?  I need to know.  I creeped her out.  You creeped her out.  I'm sorry, Tracy.  The man from Zimbabwe with the funny...  Sorry, Tracy.  Jimmy does that.  The whole stroking the forearm thing, that's where I draw the line.  I don't blame you.  I was getting a little sexy.  A little excited.  He shows us his boner every day, so...  Ay, ay, ay.  Good luck, sir. 
[02:43:30]  Escape while you can.  Good luck with the movie, Tracy, and of course, with the breastfeeding and everything.  Take care.  Thank you, Tracy.  See you later.  Thank you.  Yeah, I hope my lactating goes well.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Tracy Lourdes, everyone, from that movie.  I think you scared her away, Jimmy.  I think Jimmy scared her a little.  I didn't mean to.  You know what's happening?  See, I don't really care how it goes one way or another, but as we're going on and  on, I'm thinking, all right, we haven't mentioned the movie in a while.  She's calling it, you know, because she's in this movie to plug the movie, and it was 
[02:44:00]  nonstop talking about pornography and porno and everything, so I'm like, she's probably  going to start shying away from that.  Well, they said she actually had to go because she had a...  They said she might just talk for a couple minutes and jump, because we were 15 minutes  late, and she actually stayed on.  She has a bunch of phoners.  Okay, so wasn't you talking about the man from Zimbabwe?  Yeah.  Zimbabwe was a big chest.  I was improv-y.  It didn't go well.  I don't know.  Talking to Tracy Lourdes, I'm trying not to be offensive, because I didn't know where  I was going to...  What do you say?  I don't know.  That's the thing.  What do you say?  I think it was good.  You kind of...  You slowly let it up to the point where we were able to talk about her past and porno and 
[02:44:30]  stuff like that.  Yeah.  And it wasn't just like, so, how was that fucking...  The absolute best was your description of the movie that you've never seen.  Yeah, yeah.  That was awesome.  I know.  Opie threw me under the bus there.  I tried.  You tried.  You did well.  I had to just work off of what I heard from Kevin when he was in.  What I heard from Ope, because Ope did see it.  And, you know, very well played.  Of course, my buddy Jimmy being in it, I could just say that was one of my favorite parts.  Yeah.  I don't see my own work, much like Spencer Tracy.  I just do it.  You can't do it. 
[02:45:00]  Like Sean Penn.  You can watch yourself on screen.  He didn't watch himself either?  No, he can't do it.  If I was Sean Penn, I wouldn't watch myself in regular life.  He wouldn't watch anything of his stuff.  Any of the news clips that show me, I wouldn't watch.  Any dumb fucking words that come out of my mouth at award shows, I wouldn't watch.  I'd watch every movie.  I just keep watching Fast Times over and over.  Oh, I was funny back in 1980.  Yes.  I had a sense of humor back in 1980.  Everyone's giving us their porn names.  Any good ones?  That's an old gag.  Anything better than Joe Wadsworth? 
[02:45:30]  Well, you got Freckles.  Wadsworth.  There's a good one.  Freckles Goldenrod.  Freckles Goldenrod.  Is that a street?  Goldenrod?  Goldenrod.  And Gizmo Scagnoli.  Gizmo Scagnoli.  Gizmo Scagnoli.  Mike from Boston has that one.  Tracy Lords.  That was cool.  Yeah.  I like when she was in.  I haven't seen it.  How does she look in the movie?  Did they make her up to look kind of weird or anything?  No, I didn't see it.  Oh, that's right, Jimmy.  You didn't see it.  Yeah?  Yeah? 
[02:46:00]  Oh, yeah?  What does that mean, Opie?  What?  What does that mean when you do that?  When you shake your hand?  Is that weird?  You hold your hand out straight?  Like, ever see when somebody goes, hold your hand out straight to see if it's shaking?  Yeah.  And you hold it out straight?  You were doing that.  But then you would tilt it on its axis.  To and fro.  And it's axis.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like you're flying.  Like you're banking.  You're banking a plane.  It's pitch, roll, and yaw.  And you were using the roll axis on your hand back and forth.  Oh, we have a picture of her right there on screen. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, okay.  No one escapes time.  She looks kind of the same.  Same hair.  She's ight.  You know it's the blonde, right?  She looks like Rebecca De Mornay.  Yeah.  Yeah, she does.  Why were we so thrilled?  Yes!  Yeah!  We got it!  Eureka!  I'll tell you why.  Because what was the movie where she was breastfeeding the...  That was Hand That Rocks the Cradle.  When she decided to steal the baby.  Oh, my God.  She steals the fucking baby.  That was a good movie.  She was a creep in that one.  There was something about that.  It was so effing hot.  Chris Jericho sitting in with us, by the way. 
[02:47:00]  We've been here for a while.  It's been great.  Hand That Rocks the Cradle, and she takes the woman's baby and starts breastfeeding it,  so it gets attached to her instead of the mom.  Oh, wow.  That was pretty odd.  And that came over the same time as Single White Female, which was another one of this movie.  Oh, that was a good one, yeah.  Changing identity type movies.  I love my hair like this.  She cut her hair exactly the same and colored it like a other chick.  In the high heel of the boyfriend's eye.  I remember that.  You know they made another one of those movies.  Did they?  No one saw it.  With totally different actresses.  Oh, really?  It was a complete bomb. 
[02:47:30]  No one saw it.  Straight to DVD.  I saw it on the table one night.  I'm like, what?  It was like Single White Female 2 or something.  They made an American Psycho 2, and I think William Shatner's in it.  What?  Shut the fuck up.  I don't think I'd kid you.  I am a psycho.  What?  American Psycho 2, I believe, stars Mila Kunis from that 70s show.  Yeah, but isn't it also William Shatner's in it?  I don't know.  I can never bring myself back.  I think Shatner's.  Can you find a picture of Jimmy Norton in Zack and Miri making porno?  When the fuck did they make that movie?  I'm sure it's direct to video.  I would like to see what I had on. 
[02:48:00]  I don't remember.  A lot of those, like the fucking Van Damme movies, and the other one, the one that got  fat.  What's his name?  Seagal.  Steven Seagal movies.  I cannot stop.  I have to stop for just a few minutes.  Just enough to get a good laugh, and then I'm back on my way on the remote.  Yeah, keep going.  When he hits the screen, you're just like, look at this oaf.  He's just hysterical.  How does he still get gigs?  I know.  He's like 300 pounds.  Yeah, they're all straight to video.  Right, straight to cable.  And they're these bad action movies with bad action villains, and he's always wearing 
[02:48:30]  a long snakeskin duster.  Yeah, big duster.  That's his thing with Indian beach on it.  Walks all slow with his squinty eyes, and you can't kick over his knee.  Terrible.  My shin.  But I can't stop watching him.  They're hysterical.  It's amazing when an action star falls.  It's really sad.  Yeah, they have to stay in that shape, or else you're just like, ugh.  But because his name means so much on the international market, he still gets to make movies. 
[02:49:00]  Oh yeah, he'll sell overseas, right?  Right, exactly.  That's why you see him.  Shatner's in the movie.  It's direct-to-video.  He plays a college professor.  Thank you, blowing fans.  Who stars?  From Cleveland.  Milla Kunz.  Is that a guy?  What year did this come out?  That's that chick from that 70s show.  The American Psycho, but who plays the murderer?  Shatner.  She does.  Oh, they switched the plot around.  That's what they did for the sequel.  What?  It says, a girl named Rachel has developed a taste for murder and will stand at nothing  to become a college professor's assistant. 
[02:49:30]  A taste for murder.  That sounds terrible.  That just sounds bad.  But Shatner's the professor, so how bad can it be?  Well, that's true.  Well, really bad.  Really bad.  Shatner's wig.  Yeah, he's tying an axe under his wig, Sam.  And murders people.  The trouble with tribbles on my head.  Our food has arrived, so we're going to take a quick break.  Oh, Chris Jericho, what are we promoting in case people bail on us here?  I got a redemption song.  It's the new show on Fuse.  It's a show that features 11 crazy girls who are all great singers, and this is their 
[02:50:00]  chance to redeem themselves by using their talents to help them get out of their checkered  pasts.  What kind of checkered pasts?  We're talking alcohol, the strippers, the madams.  This is just called a past.  It's called a past.  It's actually called My Presence.  It's called Me This Morning Before I Got to the Show.  It's called Right Now.  Basically.  Girls Worth Talking To.  Girls, I'd like to know.  Chicks fighting on TV is all the rage, man.  Well, yeah, but this is a different state on that. 
[02:50:30]  Confrontations.  They're trying to transcend their past.  I gotcha.  Yeah, because they're all really great singers.  So Tracy could have been on this.  Well, if she could sing.  I don't know if she can sing or not.  Well, she has a single.  It's from Alive.  She sang in one of her movies.  She could have been on that show.  Exactly.  We're going to take a quick break and continue with Chris Jericho, our friend.  Yes.  Are you guys going to fight today?  No, we're over that now.  Fighting.  We're over that now.  I like Chris.  You're a fucking shit star.  I watched his HBO special and I was very proud of him.  Oh, good.  We'll talk about that as well. 
[02:51:00]  I was very proud of him, honestly.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Here's Jericho's hit.  There are times that take it away, but you'll still be my enemy.  The Opie and Anthony show hanging with Chris Jericho.  This was a hit.  Yeah.  This song was a hit.  That's what I'm telling you.  Like, that's fucked up, man.  I'm not just throwing smoke up his ass.  I really like the song. 
[02:51:30]  A lot.  Thank you.  And it starred one of my old pals that I haven't seen in a while.  And I got to find him because I want to invite him to the wedding.  Eddie?  Eddie, yeah.  Oh, Eddie, right.  One-legged Eddie.  I got his email address if you want it.  If it's, yeah, just in case it's different than what I have.  I've lost touch with the guy, but Eddie stars in his video.  In the video, yeah.  And he's crawling up the stairwell to the roof.  To the top floor.  So he can kill himself.  And this is his enemy.  And the band's on the roof playing. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, man!  And then they banned us on MTV because he throws himself off the roof at the end of the video.  Yeah, because, you know, suicide.  Yeah, and it was the same time when the video of Jay-Z came out where he gets shot with all  these blood packs.  He's walking on the street.  He gets, like, shot with, like, 15...  99 problems, I think, right?  That's what it was.  See, but that's different.  That's different.  Why?  Because that's a rap video.  A rock video.  If you have a guy crawling up the stairs to throw himself off the edge, you are banned.  Those douches.  That's dicks.  How do they make that decision?  That's stupid.  They're probably just scared of it.  There are ass-wipes over at MTV that make the decisions on what videos to play and what's 
[02:52:30]  not allowable.  Right.  Like, they pixelate out certain things and then they leave other things.  They twist words around so you can't even hear, you know.  Yeah, it all depends on the money behind it.  What the hell was that song?  Beautiful Girls.  No.  No.  What did they do?  What?  Sean Kingston or whatever.  He was, uh, he'd be suicidal.  I'm talking, uh.  Yeah, yeah.  He's right.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  The song was suicidal, suicidal, suicidal, whatever. 
[02:53:00]  What did they do?  They twisted the words around?  Yeah, they kind of did something.  Tom Petty, that was the one.  Where he goes, uh, let's get to the point, let's smoke another joint.  All right.  And they took the word joint and actually made it.  So it went t-tr-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j.  Let's smoke.  Fucking made it back.  Another cz-mowinj-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-jj.  Would it be funny if you just made a song and they twisted it around and somehow it came out cunt?  We don't want the word joint on there switching around.  Why does that sound like cunt?  Smoke another cunt. 
[02:53:30]  Smoke another cunt.  Another cunt.  All right.  We'll allow it.  That's it.  MTV is in the news today.  They got all their videos up on the internet now.  On the intro tubes.  You can watch them for free.  For free?  Yeah, I believe so.  Can't download them, though, right?  Probably not.  I wouldn't think so.  So whatever happened to the band?  I sort of know because we were asking you during the break.  The last record, All That Remains, that had the song Enemy on it,  really was, I don't know if you'd call it a hit,  but it got airplayed on 100 different stations across the states.  That's a hit, my friend. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, it was.  And I had started my own record company to put the record out,  and then we had a distribution company that then took, I think,  $115,000 of the profits that we made and stole it from us,  and then we had to take them to court, and then they filed bankruptcy.  So we got the moral victory, and they got the money.  So, I mean, that hurts, man.  You put a lot of time and effort in.  When you're in a band, there's not a lot of money at stake.  You know that.  But when you make money that's yours, you want it.  I mean, we earned that freaking money, man.  So it sucked, and now we're kind of trying to figure out, 
[02:54:30]  well, how do you release a record in this day and age  and try and get anything out of it?  You're the one guy I've ever heard of  that has gotten screwed with a record deal.  The only one.  It's interesting, isn't it?  It's amazing.  Everyone else makes money, just boatloads their first album especially.  That's what you think.  When someone has a record out, you think,  okay, well, they're making millions.  They made it.  It's not even close.  Now that the two companies merge,  you should do your metal show again.  I'd like to.  I got fired from XM because, you know.  Well, he used to be on the Boneyard.  I was on the Boneyard every Sunday night.  And he did a very good job, man.  He knows his shit. 
[02:55:00]  It was great, man.  I got in trouble for two reasons.  One, I wouldn't change my playlist when a new program director came in.  And two, I was insulting Oprah.  And they said, you can't insult Oprah.  She's the flagship of our company.  I said, it's fucking Boneyard.  It's heavy metal.  Nobody likes Oprah.  What were you saying about Oprah?  I didn't say anything.  I just said my show was much more valuable to this network than Oprah.  Sure.  You know, why do you need Oprah when you got Jericho?  Just making stupid jokes like that.  And apparently one of Oprah's peeps found her.  Do they understand who you are?  That you're Chris Jericho?  And this is what you do? 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, exactly.  I wasn't saying anything, you know?  Nothing worse than being hired because you do something and then getting in trouble when  you do it.  Exactly.  I never have it to us.  Oh, never.  Never.  It's like, oh, these shock jocks.  They just got fired for some heinous thing.  Let's hire them to get ratings.  And then we get ratings by doing heinous things.  And they go, stop it.  Right.  You're fired.  What is wrong with you?  What's wrong with you?  You hired us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, but that was the cool thing as far as having, like you said, the hit.  It gave me a little bit of musical credibility.  So when I did Redemption Song, it's like, well, how does Jericho, the host of a music show? 
[02:56:00]  Well, A, it's because I have this show business experience to try and teach some of these girls  that, you know, you need to put the drink down and concentrate on what you want to do.  And plus, I had a little bit of musical credibility.  So it kind of worked out together to have this.  Do you have a publicist?  I do have a publicist.  Yeah, it's obvious.  Yeah.  He's good.  That's on my own.  All of a sudden, he twisted it back.  He's good.  That's just me, though, man.  I was like, wow.  You know what, though?  It was very natural.  It's brilliant.  Yeah, you're better than most.  I'm like Gene Simmons.  Yeah.  Constantly, you know, if there's something to promote, you got to get it in there, right? 
[02:56:30]  No, that looks like your own hair, first of all.  It's not a helmet.  You're not 80 years old.  The thing is, Opie and Anthony, is that this is my real hair.  Yeah, that's it.  He's hard to even compliment, because you're like, I love Gene, but even when you're being  nice to him, he just has to be a dick by accident.  Yeah.  By proxy.  Oh, I got a Gene Simmons story that I can tell now.  Oh, remember when that fucking douchebag, Gene Simmons, was here that day, and he was  over at Channel 11 before?  Mm-hmm.  He was giving Jill all kinds of fucking shit, like trying to pick up on her and everything, 
[02:57:00]  and then he made like, he didn't really know anything was going on, and then he goes, oh,  maybe I'll just go and fuck your girlfriend.  He went over there and actually made a harassing problem over there, where her boss had to come  up to Jill and ask if there was a problem, because Gene pinned her against a wall, and  was being really physical and very, very nasty. 
[02:57:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I was like, you know, what the fuck?  Gene, sit that fucking cocksucker.  And then it's like, yeah, well, you know what I'll be doing tonight.  And he goes, yeah, well, I'll be fucking your girlfriend.  And it's like, no, Gene, first of all, I'll be.  And secondly, you know, she thinks, you know, you're a fucking old hack douche.  Wait, Anthony, was it before or after he was here? 
[02:58:00]  It was minutes before he was sitting there.  Did he know it was your chick when he was penning her?  Yes!  Oh, okay.  Of course he did!  How do you know?  He knew, because he had fucking, or there was a discussion about that beforehand.  Oh, wow.  And she had said, you know, knock it off, I have a boyfriend, shit like that.  And he wouldn't fucking stop.  He wouldn't stop being the fucking egotistical prick that he thinks everybody thinks he deserves.  It must be hard for him, though, now that he's old and ugly with bad hair, that he still 
[02:58:30]  thinks he could be Gene Simmons from 1982.  That he's getting every fucking chick.  Yes, Danny?  Do you remember when he was in, and he was sitting to my left, and I have these big computer  screens in front of me, and, you know, during interviews or whatever, like, I'll try and  research stuff and everything.  Yeah.  So I guess I was trying to type quietly.  Right.  But he still kind of heard a little bit of the, you know.  Yeah, the keyboard.  And it annoyed him so much that he actually put his hand, like, under the monitor and put  his hand on my hand, like, stop doing that while I'm talking. 
[02:59:00]  But the thing is, he didn't even skip a beat as he was talking.  And he's like, he's like, and the latest thing I'm hawking and trying to sell.  And as he's talking, he just didn't look.  He just put his hand over on Danny's hand.  His hand said, knock that the fuck off.  But his mouth was still selling his fucking wares.  Didn't even look in my direction.  Just took his hand, just went under the monitor and grabbed my hand, like, stop doing that.  Don't get me wrong.  I don't care if all of Kiss fucked her right now.  I'm just saying, at the time, don't fuck with, you know, the girl that I'm going with 
[02:59:30]  at the time.  I'm confused, though.  It disrespected me, and he was being a fucking cocksucker.  I'm confused, though.  Do you like Gene Simmons?  No, Gene Simmons is a fucking cunt.  Wow.  That's what my official stance on Gene Simmons is now.  Gene Simmons is a cunt.  No, the guy fucking knew.  And he was bullshitting and trying to play me like a fucking sap.  As I sat here, not knowing what happened yet, I knew right afterwards what happened, but  I had no idea what happened. 
[03:00:00]  He knew, and he's fucking, like, trying to play me off as the dim-witted fucking ignorant  asshole that doesn't know what's going on.  Fuck you, you old cocksucker.  Fuck you.  Your porno looked like shit, too.  You don't know how to fuck if you ever did.  If you ever did, you don't know how to fuck anymore.  Get any girl that you fucked, I'll fuck her, and they'll go, that's a fucking.  The thing I got from Gene Simmons wasn't a fucking.  What was wrong with his technique?  What?  What was wrong with his technique? 
[03:00:30]  He's got no stamina.  He's got nothing.  He's fucking just a load fucking blobbing back and forth.  Make some moves.  Twist some shit around.  Make the girl happy, you dumb fuck.  Put your face down there.  First of all, he put a condom on, Fad.  Oh, put a condom on.  It was a kiss condom.  Oh, what?  Yeah, he put a kiss condom on.  He probably fucks, like, the teacher from Forrest Gump.  Yeah.  I got to move Danny up the list.  That's good.  Danny, I'm moving you up the list today.  That's good.  You're up David's list.  That's good. 
[03:01:00]  All right.  Maybe I could be funnier than Steve.  Yeah.  That'd be nice.  You already are.  You said something.  Gene Simmons.  My loyalty is with Anthony.  I love Gene, but my loyalty will always be with Anthony.  How loyal, though?  Go home.  You got some memorabilia from Kiss.  Are you willing to throw it in tomorrow?  Wow.  Are you willing to throw it in the dumpster?  Hold on.  He should bring it in tomorrow and throw it away.  Yes.  Bring in your Kiss memorabilia tomorrow, Jimmy.  I wouldn't bring that in if he had harassed Anthony's mother and my mother.  I'm not getting rid of my Kiss shit. 
[03:01:30]  But there is loyalty there.  There is loyalty.  There is loyalty in here.  But you're not bringing the memorabilia.  No.  Gene, sign that stuff for me.  We need a Gene memorabilia burning tomorrow.  That's it.  No, I could agree with my friend Anthony on one hand, but I'm very loyal.  Gene, it's signed.  Wherever Anthony stands on it, I'm with him.  That's it.  I understand your point with saying, did he know beforehand and stuff, which would be like...  Did he find out?  Did she...  This is the only reason I'm asking is because, like, was he hassling her? 
[03:02:00]  And then she went, I have a boyfriend, and he doesn't give a fuck.  And then finally, at the end, she finally said, my boyfriend is Anthony from the opening  Anthony show.  And maybe that's what stopped him.  That's why I was asking.  He knew right away.  He kept...  He was persistent on it, and he kept...  And it was harassment on his part to where her boss had to come over to her and ask her  what happened.  Like, people were saying that Gene was harassing you and stuff.  And, yeah.  And then he comes in here and fucking looking me right in the eyes and playing me like that. 
[03:02:30]  Well, maybe I'll just fuck your girlfriend.  Like, and I laughed because it's like, oh, I'm thinking he doesn't even know who the fuck  she is or anything.  But he knew exactly everything, and he's fucking playing me off like that.  Go fuck yourself, you fucking old man.  Cocksucker.  Go franchise your shit little makeup band out and make a few more bucks.  Wow.  Drop dead rich.  Good.  Good for you.  Look at Gene fucking in his porno. 
[03:03:00]  Good job.  He's wearing a T-shirt.  He should.  Yeah, lift the gut up.  There you go.  Now your dick can fit in.  Who's the girl?  She's fantastic.  She's got big boobies.  I don't know.  Look, look at his slow motion fucking.  I love the fact he's wearing a T-shirt and socks, and his pants are down still.  Oh, God.  It's like the old mangy lion plowing the fucking lioness on the Serengeti.  You know that old mangy lion?  It's his last year as Top of the Pride. 
[03:03:30]  Wow, you've been holding this in for a while.  Oh, fuck Gene Simmons.  We haven't touched a raw nerve here.  Wow.  Can we have a kiss song, please?  Which one do you like?  Link it up.  Which one do you want today?  Oh, give me one with Gene singing.  Yeah.  Great expectations.  We're Dr. Love.  Yeah.  Here you go.  Dr. Love.  Dr. Love.  Go ahead.  Climb aboard that fucking broad in your porno.  Go ahead. 
[03:04:00]  Boy, you must be proud of that one.  His flat fucking saggy ass is moving like, it looks like two old droopy doilies swinging  in the breeze on a clothesline.  That's what his ass looks like as he's fucking this hot chick.  Droopy doilies.  Oh, you know he'd be getting her if he wasn't Gene Simmons from Kiss.  You know that.  Absolutely.  There.  There's Gene.  That's it.  The old lion.  Punch up an old lion fucking a lioness. 
[03:04:30]  And that's what Gene looks like.  Nailed that bitch.  The girl's on the money over there, man.  He pulled that up instantly.  That's it, Gene.  Goddamn.  As long as you can get through one fucking without your hair falling off, I guess it's  okay.  I guess it's a victory.  Droopy doilies.  There you go.  That's the line of the day.  Oh, after he ate the girl's pussy, she thought she forgot to shave, but it was just Gene's  wig fell in her lap.  He didn't realize.  Do you guys still do the line of the day?  Oh, yeah.  Because you just heard it right there. 
[03:05:00]  Wow.  Nice.  Fuck you, Gene Simmons.  Pinned her up against the wall, huh?  Yeah.  Like pinned her against the fucking wall.  Was there any booby touching going on?  I think he was like trying.  She was pushing his hands down because he was trying to put his hands around her waist.  And it was like in the main office part where everyone could see everything.  And people were looking and it was like, oh, this is weird.  Like, this is weird.  What the fuck is Gene doing?  Are you mad?  Pretty much getting close to molesting somebody. 
[03:05:30]  Are you mad that you didn't know when he came in here?  That's what pissed me off the most is that he fucking looked at me and he knew and he's  fucking straight face pitching all of his wares.  I'm sitting there giving him the time of day and a forum to pitch his fucking bullshit  on and he's playing me like a sap, like a sucker.  Fuck him.  Fuck you, Gene.  I think you should get Gene in studio and you can.  Oh, if Gene came in here, I wouldn't fucking hold back.  I'd say the same fucking thing. 
[03:06:00]  Whether he was on the phone or fucking in the studio, I would say the same fucking thing  to him because that pissed me off.  He tried to play me and he'd be all, well, listen, well, and I wouldn't let him fucking  sit there and do that.  No way.  Oh, man.  No fucking way.  Get Gene Simmons on the show when Jimmy's out of town.  Go ahead.  As soon as possible.  Gordon would get his autograph.  Fuck him.  Oh, I've got it already.  I would be right here with Anthony.  I would not as much as he was here, but I would be completely with you.  In spirit, you wouldn't actually say that.  And all that memorabilia.  You're going to bring that in tomorrow, Jimmy?  Gene Simmons memorabilia. 
[03:06:30]  That's good.  Would you break something else from your collection in honor of the fact that Anne hates Gene Simmons?  Pull that wig off, add two guys, and you'll have a lemon party.  No shit.  Fuck you.  Don't mess with it.  Oh, there he is, right?  Yeah.  Is that really him without his hair?  That's good.  That's fully shot.  Yeah, no, some say it is, and others say that it was a stunt.  Right.  Like he put a bald cap on it.  Oh, did he?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Go play keyboards for Letterman. 
[03:07:00]  Well.  Fuck yourself.  Why don't we...  Fuck your mother.  Let's give an open invite to Gene Simmons to come back on our show to comment on what Anne is saying today.  No problem.  And in between commenting, we'll let you plug a few of your shitty...  Oh, what would he be fucking plugging now?  Besides other people's girls.  Besides trying to plug, yeah.  Trying to plug my ex-girlfriend.  Can we get Gene Simmons on the phone at least?  For when?  Like now.  Would be good.  Yeah, he's waiting. 
[03:07:30]  See if he's up.  Huh?  I can see if they're up.  Oh, yeah.  He needs his betty-bye.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Tell him to do a shot of Geritol and get his ass on the phone.  Fuck him.  I'll say, Anthony, I'm upset with you, but buy my new DVD.  What I was doing...  No, you don't understand.  This is what I do.  See, this is what I do.  I know these guys.  He would say something like that.  You're absolutely right.  It's just what I do.  I don't know.  Why are you getting so upset?  Why are you so...  I didn't actually fuck her.  Yeah, he'd do that passive-aggressive bullshit that he does. 
[03:08:00]  Why get upset, Anthony?  Why...  I don't understand.  She's a big girl.  Where's this hostility coming from?  If she wanted to fuck me, she would have fucked me.  But since she didn't, where's the problem?  He's got his fucking voice down.  And it would be like, well, Gene, you came over here and started fucking with me.  You didn't tell me shit about that.  And then playing me off like I'm a fucking sap by telling me you're going to go and fuck  my girlfriend that night where no one was in on the joke except you and your ego?  Go fuck yourself.  You know what he would say.  What?  How do you know she didn't want it? 
[03:08:30]  How do you know?  They all want it from Gene.  Just watch my video.  They're all dogs.  Look at my video.  It looks fantastic.  As I lay there, ugh, just fucking, oh my God, being ravaged by that.  That fucking ball sack must scrape on the rug like melted Turkish taffy.  And we're supposed to be interviewing Chris Jericho.  Oh, I'm sorry, Chris.  And that TV show, when is that?  I don't know if we compete with Droopy Doily. 
[03:09:00]  He's got doily ass and Turkish taffy balls.  All I have to say is thank God it wasn't Ozzy because then it would be really confusing in  here today.  No, no.  Thank God it's, you know, Ozzy.  Ozzy wouldn't do that.  Ozzy wouldn't do that, right?  Ozzy's a respectful man.  Ozzy is respect.  You know what it was?  It was the lack of respect for me.  He disrespected me.  Especially as a guest on your show.  Yes, as a guest on my show.  Thank you, Chris.  Absolutely.  As a guest on the show.  And he disrespected me, knew he was disrespecting me, and did it in a way where he knew I didn't 
[03:09:30]  know the situation, so I couldn't even fight back, which is a pussy ass fucking punk move.  Nice.  Let's go to the phones.  Yes.  Who's the one to defend Gene Simmons here?  Greg in New Hampshire.  Oh, hey, the day of that original interview, I was getting douche chills, like you can't  even believe.  I called a few times so you guys would trash him, and I'm so glad I'm still listening to  Heron now, because he is such a douchebag.  Thank you.  Good. 
[03:10:00]  When does the fucking Gene Simmons kiss penis implant come out?  Maybe you could fuck a little better.  You are one lousy fuck from the look of it.  Oh, God.  That's his sex music.  That's what girls like.  A nice fucking fuck that they could use a grandfather clock pendulum to fuck by.  A metronome with the fucking weight way up top. 
[03:10:30]  That's what they want to see.  Tick tock.  Tick tock.  Change it up a little, Gene.  Do you fuck faster or harder?  I do it all.  Slow, fast.  I like poking a little, and then the slow drive.  The slow drive.  And then fast.  And then one leg's up.  The other leg's up.  They're both down.  Flip over.  We'll do it this way.  I'm on my back.  She's on her back. 
[03:11:00]  We're both on our fucking head.  Against the headboard.  Against the bed.  I don't give a shit.  I'm fucking.  And in comparison, Gene Simmons?  That's how we fuck.  Slow and steady wins the race.  Okay.  How about I go and fuck your girlfriend?  No, no, no, no, no.  He's turning dopey.  Oh, fuck me harder.  Fuck me harder, Gene.  No, no, no, no. 
[03:11:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I think the three of us could just leave and let Anthony talk to this for another hour.  We had it.  Gene Simmons, enough of him already.  He's just getting a lot of publicity.  He would love this.  Oh, yeah, he would.  There's no such thing as bad publicity, Anthony.  No, no.  All publicity is good publicity.  It's bringing everybody back to Kiss.  That's what it is.  The greatest rock and roll band ever.  It all comes back to Kiss.  Shut it.  That's really.  Fucking Gene.  Glad we got that out there.  Man, that was purged.  I'm surprised I forgot about that. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, well, now you're never going to forget it now.  How did I forget that?  Do you want the audience to Google bomb something?  Gene Simmons.  Gene Simmons, lousy lay.  Nah, we could do better than that.  Really?  Yeah, that is pretty bad.  Gene Simmons wig.  The problem is most of our listeners don't know how to spell lousy.  Yeah, that's true.  They'll mess it all up.  Or Gene.  Or Gene Simmons living in Laos.  J-A-N-S.  I don't know what happened.  Gene Simmons went to Laos, wasn't he? 
[03:12:30]  He's got lice.  How about it?  No.  You could just throw it in the washing machine.  How about a simple F.  Gene Simmons?  That's good.  Yeah.  I don't care.  What do you got there?  I just took that.  I'd had it with him by that point.  And then I'd had it with him when he was sitting there.  I was just being gracious because, again, as Chris had pointed out, he's a guest on the show.  But, you know, after I found out, I was, like, so pissed that I didn't get a chance to, like, jump on him for that whole fucking episode. 
[03:13:00]  Because you had no idea.  No, and that's the point.  I want people to know that.  I didn't know.  And would have unloaded in front of him.  Guaranteed.  Fuck yeah.  He didn't know.  Oh, that's got to be a treat into the girl's ear.  That's got to be a treat.  Oh.  Sorry, Jim, I'm kind of using your bit, but the Gene Simmons.  After that fucking lousy fuck.  Does it end with a blorka blorka blorka?  Blorka blorka.  Oh, just no muscles left to launch any jizz. 
[03:13:30]  It just must dribble out.  Like lava.  Oh, it's just got to be horrible.  You know when you turn the hose off first and then take the nozzle off?  Lava.  And it just goes blork, glork over the top of your hand.  Lava after the eruption.  Oh, yeah.  The volcano's long been dormant.  It's very bubbly.  It just pours over the edge every so often.  A glurg, glurg, glurg.  Misfire.  Fuck. 
[03:14:00]  Can I just say, out of all the radio interviews I've done, that your microphones smell the nicest?  Do you guys have sprays?  Oh, people have to do that beforehand.  Man, that's a really nice smell.  It's like you've washed these overnight.  A little lava coming down the mountain.  A glurg, glurg, glurg.  It's lava moving so slowly, people can just walk by it.  That's Gene.  Man, you're on the case, man.  He's pulling up all this great stuff.  I'm feeling I'm going to come.  Give me another ten minutes. 
[03:14:30]  Glurg.  Glurg.  Man, was Jill upset at the time?  Yeah, she wasn't very happy about that.  She's the type of girl that can take care of herself.  Yeah, you know, she did.  She took care of herself.  And management actually went to her and said, look.  Yeah, said, was there a problem that we should know about?  Because it was so blatant and invasive.  What gave it away?  Invasive.  What gave it away?  She was taking a shower.  Scrubbing. 
[03:15:00]  She's sitting in a cold tub, just quietly weeping.  I don't want to use the word, but you know, the type of shower.  Got to get the filth off me.  I can't get over what a good fuck Anthony probably is.  Honest to God.  Fuck much more like Gene does.  I'm a little worse lay.  I'm mediocre because I'm so high maintenance.  I have to just go slow.  You have to play with my nipples because I've desensitized myself.  Oh, badly.  I'm going to go back to Jimmy now.  I enjoy him.  Jimmy.  Ant's got a problem with Gene Simmons.  Coincidentally, you've got a book called I Hate Your Guts. 
[03:15:30]  Yes.  There will be a paperback.  And you know how you've got to add some new material in the paperback.  Will there be an appendix?  A Gene Simmons chapter in honor of Anthony.  I would certainly see that.  I would happily.  I actually put a Gene Amendment in the old book.  and Happy Endings because it was whatever.  But I would happily, if Anthony wrote something and wanted to put it in.  Oh, you won't write it.  I would love to.  It wouldn't be as funny if I wrote it because Anthony's angry for it.  Oh, I would love to.  I would happily put it under my name.  Yeah, but you're the author. 
[03:16:00]  I think you should write it in.  Oh, and I'd love to write that.  No, but Anthony.  You'd have to just transcribe what he said today.  Yeah, just take the tapes of the show.  I don't think you couldn't do any better than that.  I would happily, for Anthony, put any type of a, in the paperback.  I would love to.  Thank you, Jim.  That's not a bad angle.  It's a great angle.  I would love to get Jill's side of the story.  What?  I'm just saying, what do you mean you have to bail?  Huh?  He's got a lot of media to do today.  I do, yeah.  We didn't even, like, discuss anything yet.  We discussed the show.  I wanted to, you know, discuss his show because it does sound cool. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, what's the show again?  There's girls that kind of have this checkered past a little bit.  What are some of them, maybe alcoholic?  Alcoholic.  There's been some, you know, there's stripping in the past, or like one of them was a madam.  You know, there's been some drug issues.  There's been a lot of parties.  But the point of the show is that they can all really sing, like I said.  So that's the gimmick.  It's not a train wreck.  It's just that these girls got to kind of pull themselves out of this, you know, hole  they've dug themselves into if they really want to get a chance to make it.  So it's kind of a cool issue because, like, as soon as they come on the show, they're 
[03:17:00]  drinking, they're, you know, partying.  Also, they're still kind of fucked up and everything.  Exactly.  And then, like, the first episode, we take them to a bunch of bars, a party bus, they're  drinking the party, and then halfway through, bring them upstairs where there's a full band,  all the judges are there, and then they have to sing a song they learned earlier.  So there's a lot of train wrecks that come up pretty early, and then they realize that,  listen, if we really want to do this, we better pull ourselves together.  So that's kind of, it is, it's like American Idol, but with this bad girl influence involved.  Right, right. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, it's not like, because if on American Idol they find out someone has a checkered,  they, like, throw them off.  They throw them off.  This is the exact opposite of that.  And the thing is, the winner got a contract with Geffen Records, so there's something really  big at the end of, it's not just, they don't want to date with me, it's not like Jericho  of Love.  Lord knows we've seen enough of those shows.  Are they, like, cute girls?  Yeah, they're all gorgeous, man.  There's a lot of hot chicks.  Is there a website?  Can we check out some of the girls?  Let's see it.  Go to Fuse TV.  I think there's a Redemption song on there.  Actually, it was in the Post today.  I'll show you the picture right here.  Oh!  We got a good review in the Post. 
[03:18:00]  Nice!  We'll be on tonight at 11 o'clock on at 11 o'clock.  There's the chicks right there.  Don't say it was Linda Stacey, though, or Stassi, because they'll...  Oh, okay!  Let me see.  There you go.  Let me see.  Yep.  Yep.  Nope.  Yes.  Yep.  Yep.  Nope.  A couple no's.  A couple yes.  Yep.  Yep.  Nope.  Maybe.  Yep.  Okay, so what do you get about, seven out of 11 yaps?  Yeah.  That's not bad.  That ain't bad.  I know, you know, it's my taste.  Right, right.  So is mine.  Boy.  My taste goes more towards people in a relationship. 
[03:18:30]  Obviously, you said no to the two black girls.  I'm just not into chocolate.  I would do the black girls.  Which rather?  Oh, yeah, the first one's a little brutal.  Bad idol.  Very cool.  Are you still wrestling?  I don't even know.  Yeah, I was actually the champion, the WWE champion.  I just lost it on Sunday.  Are you on Monday Night Raw?  Is it Monday Night Raw?  There's an 800th episode, three-hour special.  It's live this Monday on USA.  That's you?  That's me.  That's Raw.  Yeah, exactly.  That's very cool.  Yeah, it's cool, man.  It's been going good.  Since I saw you last year. 
[03:19:00]  When you didn't give us the scoop.  When we all knew.  That's right.  When you all knew.  But I couldn't do it at the time.  But you knew.  Yeah, to keep you on a gag order.  Yeah, but the book went to the New York Times bestseller list, which was awesome.  Then I came back to wrestling and became the champion.  Now I'm doing the show Redemption Song, and it's all because of Opie and Anthony's influence.  You guys are the inspiration.  Yeah, all right.  How's that?  That's fantastic.  I'm just trying to keep away from Gene Simmons.  You banged one of our girls.  Yeah, as long as you're in here.  You banged one of our girls.  It's obvious.  Yeah.  I would.  Yeah, well.  I've never seen any girls in here. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, I know, right?  It's just crazy, long Kramer hair.  Actually, his hair looks like Gene Simmons in about 1985.  Yes.  Tears of Falling video.  Tears of Falling video.  No, no.  What's the greatest metal song of all time, Chris Jericho?  Oh, man.  Greatest metal song of all time.  Run to the Hills?  Well, I was thinking of something from Maiden.  Wow, that is a good one.  Run to the Hills.  I'll tell you, man.  It's not number one, though.  It needs one more verse.  It's only two verses.  I wish it was one more.  It's an amazing song.  It's one of the shortest Maiden songs. 
[03:20:00]  I wish it was one more verse.  That's a great song.  It's one of the greatest of all time.  I always love War Kigs, too.  I think it's a great song.  War Kigs.  Yeah.  Let me know some rules.  Yeah.  You know this one.  Come on.  Come on.  There you go, Bruce.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, hey, hey.  That's Dan.  Hey, look, look.  Check it out.  Oh, wow.  That's Danny's hair.  Damn.  How good is this effing song?  Fucking unbelievable. 
[03:20:30]  That voice is great.  Bruce is the best.  Yeah.  Still sounds like this, too.  Yeah, isn't that amazing when a singer can still just blast out vocals like that?  Do you listen to any new music?  As far as new bands, I think Avenged Sevenfold is my favorite new metal band.  They've got a real good Maiden influence sort of thing, but I still love Metallica and  Maiden and those bands there.  What do you think of the new Metallica?  Love it.  I love it.  I haven't tracked through it yet.  It's the best record in 20 years.  Really?  For sure, yeah.  They finally got back on course again.  Long songs, intricate, great guitar solos. 
[03:21:00]  It's a great record.  I saw them at Bonnaroo.  They were fucking amazing.  Amazing.  Yeah.  They're the best live band.  Ah.  You know.  You hear about Zeppelin?  Well, what's the deal?  They're going to tour with Outplant?  They're going to attempt to.  They're going to get a new singer.  Turn, turn, turn.  You can't do Led Zeppelin if Robert Plant is still walking the face of this planet without  Robert Plant.  That is the dumbest idea I've ever heard in my life.  Absolutely ridiculous.  That's in the paper today.  Jimmy's just into this.  How do you not fucking walk under the hills? 
[03:21:30]  I know.  I'm just rockin'.  You know everyone's jumping up and down.  There's 60,000 people in Finland rocking right now.  In Finland, yeah.  In Finland.  That's a girl.  Even though I don't like Bruce Dickinson because of the way he was fucking shitting on  Sabbath on that Ozfest tour and then Sharon was...  And then Sharon wasn't happy.  Yeah, I don't want Sabbath bad-mouthed by fucking Dickinson.  No, he wasn't shitting on Sabbath.  He was talking about reality shows.  About how Maiden doesn't need a reality show.  And then Sharon threw eggs at Maiden.  But Ozzy was embarrassed.  Ozzy said that's bullshit.  You don't do that at a show.  I got to get back to the Gene Simmons, Jill Anthony thing.  Redemption song. 
[03:22:00]  Redemption song.  Just because...  I don't even know who wrote this.  You really shouldn't leave your name because it's good.  Did Jill shoot Gene with her butt grease to escape like a squid?  Holy shit.  That's a squid.  Hey, I want to play a song for you.  Oh, God.  Fuckers.  Everyone's a comedian.  I'm just going to say Redemption song again.  Redemption.  These girls are redeeming themselves because they're crazy. 
[03:22:30]  You watch UFC at all?  You watch UFC?  Who's the wrestler that got involved in UFC?  He's doing well, actually.  Oh, Brock Lesnar.  Brock Lesnar, yeah.  He's going to be a champion there.  Because his only thing is he's a rookie.  Wait until he gets experience.  He's so strong.  And he's very tenacious.  And he's an ultimate fighter, literally.  He will kill all those guys once he's got more experience.  He's just one of the strongest guys I've ever seen.  Can he fight standing up?  I mean, obviously he can wrestle on the ground.  I think he's learning all that stuff. 
[03:23:00]  He's so powerful, though.  I want your honest opinion.  We've got a band.  They're huge fans of the show.  And they came up with this song.  We're trying to make it a hit.  What's it called?  I just want to play it for you.  Okay.  All right?  Take a listen.  For real.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay. 
[03:23:30]  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  heavy  my blood's 
[03:24:00]  heavy  my blood's  getting cold  you see me  coming  back  Huh?  What?  I was clipping  a little bit.  I was clipping  a little bit?  I was crying  a little bit.  What's the  name of the  band?  Uh,  uh,  it's from rich oh from rich yeah he doesn't even have a name for his band yet what do you think of 
[03:24:30]  the song i thought it was pretty pretty cool once it got going it's funny though because at first  we was talking about the pendulum swinging with that deep voice i thought somebody's just done  a gimmick gene simmons song about the grandfather yeah yeah the pendulum yeah that's what i thought  you know i'm fucking like a pendulum very slowly i fuck like the pendulum oh chris really has to  bail i have to bail yeah let's ask the uh the professional what did you think yeah i love that  version of that song it's mighty good see mighty mighty good to bring in on the bit uh steve who  produces for the show used to do a little uh band thing uh-huh his original song was a um pendulum 
[03:25:00]  by his band foundry now we're having guys remake his song gotcha from about 14 15 years ago that  was a new york-based producer who completely took it and did played everything himself uh rearranged  everything himself and that was i i personally think that's the best version that's coming so far  when it got rocking i thought it was pretty cool yeah like i said at first i thought it was a gimmick  that someone cooked up quickly yeah yeah he was talking about grandfather cock pendulum  that's old gene i just said that's even better oh we got uh we got uh katie morgan on the phone 
[03:25:30]  all right so well why don't we uh yeah say goodbye chris's uh show sherek go redemption song it's uh  redemption song it's on uh tonight on fuse i don't know what channel that is but it's on all the cable uh  networks it's uh 11 o'clock and then tomorrow night uh the 800th episode of raw it's a three-hour  special live yeah eight o'clock i'm not sure i'm sure they'll do something it's like because  it's because it's three hours there's a lot of time to fill so we'll probably have the iron chic on  there so i don't shake greatest country in world uh terren and what the madison square garden

[03:38:30]  question of course it sounds better when your mouth's full of course i like to have sex slowly  okay and i need my nipples played with and then the whole time i just kind of i get choked up and  i cry a little and i say please love me  wow i i mean i really can't wait because you just keep making it sound better and better  if you're just tuning in we're we're talking to katie morgan the star of uh the changeling which  opens on uh friday you you are you are an asshole no no it's all good dude if he wants me to be 
[03:39:00]  compared to angelina i'm okay with that or is it the haunting of uh molly hartley i forgot what  movie you're in i can't remember who did that one i really have amnesia the zach and the mary  come on now hold on you were reported you were homeschooled by your mother and father what i was  i was and your father's a christian pastor he is oh boy so would you now is this kind of like  did it wasn't belladonna mormon isn't she from utah i believe she is yeah the more men the better 
[03:39:30]  you know what i found chimney crickets so uh don't they usually do it the other way and it's  more women for them all right i don't know right mormons i think yeah but they're hiding their  homosexuality so is this a uh a thing about like you was your father really strict um you know i  wouldn't even say strict so much as i was just sheltered i just didn't know anything was out there  so it wasn't like i didn't have a curfew because we just didn't go out kind of thing it wasn't so 
[03:40:00]  much as strict as a sheltering did you get uh spankings as a kid uh as a little kid but you know  you outgrow those by about 10 or so once you don't sit on the lap anymore yeah oh uncle paul  hey did you really enter uh the business to pay off bail and a plea bargain after being arrested  for transporting plot sort of sort of that's not quite exactly true i did start in the business  after being arrested um and i did have some money to pay off on that but i actually started it  because i needed a job that i had the freedom to go to and from court with so this kind of worked 
[03:40:30]  hey so you like just like sex and you're like fucking i'm because like the jump to being  comfortable being filmed sexually that's a big thing i've watched them shoot it it's not easy  to to to do that on film i mean you're telling me jim for me no no pun intended um i was already  pretty pretty slutty we were already having like uh swing parties when i was like 18 and 19 i was  married and all of our friends would come over and we'd have orgies in the living room wow yeah so 
[03:41:00]  it really wasn't that big of a step i was watching a porn and i went oh shit they're getting paid for  that yeah and it like it was like a light bulb going off and you know so i went and got an agent  and here i am damn wow how old are you now katie i'm 28 but don't tell anybody wow you know you've  been off a while i think you're gonna start doing uh legit films now because of zach and mary make a  see i am totally down for it i had so much fun doing it i definitely love the acting and you know  i can still have sex in the dressing room you're pretty much a natural you come alive on the on the 
[03:41:30]  screen there well thank you that is a freaking awesome compliment and the big boobs don't hurt  no well you know like i said i i like them oh i like this katie a lot well thank you  she don't like you no no it's not that she doesn't like me i think she likes me as a person  sure sure i think if she came in yeah i think if she came in here and met little jimmy uh she would  fall in love they all do she'd be happy to have meatloaf with me but she finds me there are some  good buffets out here in vegas of course there are i mean i i don't need them i only at the five-star 
[03:42:00]  restaurants with my dates but i i think the important thing is she finds me sexually repugnant  i think that she would have a wonderful time at din din with me yeah um but the idea of fucking me  it makes it gives her that feeling somebody gets when they watch a child fall into a sinkhole  well you know i'm not very fond of children but um i do i do think that since i don't know you i can't 
[03:42:30]  really make that judgment on account of i'm not too picky on looks it's more what you can do although  you're not really uh selling your skills too well there so i always undersell this way when i'm not  a complete judge you're like wow i thought that would be awful right well see there's that then at  least it's a slight improvement over exactly what i was expecting like i want you to expect basically  a disaster and i i hit you with almost mediocrity and you're like all right i mean i wouldn't set  him on fire i'd never fuck him again that's a great strategy of course i'll be like you ready 
[03:43:00]  for the worst fuck of your life and then when i give it to him they're like i've had a couple that  were worse yeah you'd have a long way to go to be the worst there's definitely a few on that list  what was the worst worst fuck you ever had and why the worst ever that that i can specifically recall  on it was on a set and bizarrely enough people later said that's one of the best scenes ever so  apparently i can't ask because i was physically nauseous um the man ate my face like i don't know 
[03:43:30]  if he thought it was hot but he went to like kiss my ear and somehow like his mouth was eating half  my head was it de niro and cape fear wow so he was licking or biting your face well no he was sort  of sucking on my head but his mouth was bizarrely large so he had like my cheek and my whole jaw like  in his mouth it was bizarre who what's his name i yeah no i'm not doing that why the scene is out  there it's not it's not really it's the scene that's out there he was um okay it was john  who oh really yeah i don't know i don't know we just had no chemistry no chemistry how does he keep 
[03:44:00]  an erection like as a woman i know how you can do it but how does a guy if there's no chemistry which  has to happen how they they definitely have some tricks that they have to uh cabergett yeah yeah see  you already know yeah which is again why i don't work with them anymore i actually have a  absolute policy i do not work with guys he's caberject it's not safe because you think you  can absolutely it can stay too well we talked to a porn guy who had to go to the hospital for that  one time right right they uh put a needle in your dick or something yeah well not only that since 
[03:44:30]  i'm on radio and i can actually spread the word i will it actually can cause sterility in women it  is for paraplegic people in a committed relationship it is not for use in porn wow really how what like  is one of my biggest pet peeves how could it uh cost wow because it can leak out the hole oh  yeah because they shoot it in with a needle it's freaking horrible oh that's why oh so so if you're  paralyzed you guys use that and the ones that do i do not work with how do guys are there guys that 
[03:45:00]  use it often yes uh yeah there's some that just can't do it without it how let me ask you i've taken  viagra and cialis now see those are different because those you at least have to have some sort of  attraction some sort of being turned on to make it work it definitely helps but you have to be  there too with the cabbage act it just doesn't what exactly does it do it just makes your dick  completely hard just hard like like a rock like actually painfully hard how do you spit and  it makes it wet that's kind of a different different goal and wait katie is it because it's hard 
[03:45:30]  sometimes to have an orgasm as a guy when you're taking these these pills um like if i take a full  cialis it's hard that's why i don't take it that much is it hard for a guy on cabbage yet to come  sure sure because it's completely swollen up and because they're not even necessarily uh aroused  oh my god yeah there's lots of reasons i don't work with the guys who use that i like i like men who  like women so you know how um you know how anthony stays hard does he like women looks at his bank  account oh yeah that'll do it that's gonna go with 18 year old girls uh well hey uh katie can you 
[03:46:00]  mail us a pair of your uh panties so we can keep promoting wear any i have like i have old ones  from the point of shame when i had to take them off but in real life i don't wear panties you're  not a lot of fun i mean well sorry i i am i am no dildo playing no sex toys disappearing i juggled it  and then made it disappear you're not mailing us panties how about this yeah when i get to vegas you  and i will go out we'll have a couple butterscotch candies nice and uh is that a euphemism or is that a 
[03:46:30]  drink no no it's an actual butterscotch and uh the candy not even a drink oh okay and we'll get  to know each other and we'll see where the chemistry is okay while we're sitting there sucking on our  candy yeah i do very seductive things i'm eating candy i think you'll find me enchanting  i think you'll find me enchanting yes i think you'll be bowled over by my moves i won't be able  to take my eyes off yet of course not you'll be like who is the slug putting his arm around me 
[03:47:00]  while he's yawning why don't we let katie go oh i'm working on katie i think katie and i are  developing i think there's some kind of see yeah i'm gonna i am looking forward to sucking on candy  with you that's what jimmy does that's the magic that is jimmy norton's right immediately you're like  well you know i'm doubtful but the and then you'd come in here you'd start talking jimmy's very smooth  and suave yeah i wear muscle shirts like a woman's first a woman's first instinct when she meets me as  wow i'd rather fuck a cicada i do i do actually know what you look like oh no well you only saw 
[03:47:30]  the movie though the first thing you say is oh no that actually i wasn't trying to be funny i know  you actually really said that was like literally a gut reaction like ah no i'm great in the earpiece  but i'm a little taxing on the eyes but wait was it uh from where though from the movie only right  no no of course i i was actually at the avn show there's a lot of prosthetics makeup on and  everything right yeah the movie is no indicator and i had to dress down at the avn you know because 
[03:48:00]  i wanted like you know manwell ferrara and all those guys to feel better about the way they look  of course right of course of course how about brie olsen do you know brie not well but i do know of  her she's lovely isn't she she's a very nice girl right very pretty girl yeah she's a cute little  blonde right yeah she looks young she's got big boobies too she's very big natural  too many of the new girls i'm pretty much out at this point wow you're done really i well you know  i i will never say officially because i really really do like it and i just might go ahead and 
[03:48:30]  do more one more cock right you know i have not shot anything in just over a year kind of like an  old ball player yeah you can never really say goodbye just pick up the bat one more time with your  mouth you ever bang lex i i didn't i didn't he's actually one of the ones i missed well do you want  do you do black guys you don't care i did years ago but i only like we're running out of time here  i'd like to say goodbye to a request for you ever bang uh steven carr no i don't believe so he 
[03:49:00]  specialized in like bear films yeah he's really a weird guy he's not not really well hung or good  in bed but there was something about him just not musically or producer wise that people liked  i did do ed powers if that makes me feel better very average guy powers ed powers what he had like  six inches going he would do well almost almost six how about max hardcore uh max is not a very  big dick at all i never worked with max for the reasons that he went to jail oh because what is he 
[03:49:30]  in jail uh or gonna be i don't know for what max was convicted of obscenity in tampa which is  disgusting but what was it was it the pissing or the speculum what got him it just he was just most  of his stuff was really violent and kind of gross can you believe though that that actually  would get you in jail well if you send european copies to uh red states they can't oh yeah but  the european copies are worse i thought just like the european rules are completely different i just 
[03:50:00]  thought like uh whatever you know kitty porn or something would get you in trouble or bestiality  or something like that but anything between consenting adults no you start playing with poo and too many  fingers places and whatnot and you break a lot of laws wait does max do shit though laws i mean  you know i don't know specifically which ones he got busted for i do know that that is legal in german  porn or legal what isn't that's legal in german kid shows  german wedding videos show fucking a rabbit it's their seinfeld 
[03:50:30]  hello jerry elaine's blowing a dog  who are these jews  hey elaine make sure he put up take the oven mitts to his his paws  god damn that's funny what was that forfeited what happened 
[03:51:00]  i don't know  they got his website if you try to go to max hardcore.com it says forfeited this website has  been forfeited to the united states government  how the fuck did that happen well that's a little weird man as far as uh  there's a bunch of stuff on it uh up on the web if you would actually research the case i can't  remember exactly what he got taken down for but it was a few different things i would love to talk  well because i know they're going after the reco act this is where i want to get them on the rico act 
[03:51:30]  that was the rico act the rico act you heard it enough how dare they fucking say what can be legal  exactly how you fucking dare they two consenting adults should be able to  shit into each other's mouths thank god somebody agrees come on jim me and you that's right a  couple of men we laugh about it after we brush our teeth we see who's got the biggest silo sticking  out of our mouth a giant grain silo a brown grain silo that's that's also known as a lesson 
[03:52:00]  learned i'll keep away from this stuff while we're out having our sundays yes if you can eat food  after that oh please i can eat it while i'm watching i can i know i know  you ever see two girls one cup i yes yeah what'd you think sexy yeah see i kind of i'm like a nice  girl i want to see pretty people having nice sex yeah yeah i know i know when you throw in like  baked beans and stuff i get kind of gross yeah all right well apparently they've been after max 
[03:52:30]  hardcore for quite some time it's fucking disgusting like 10 years already they tried getting him on on  child pornography because they the government was claiming that he portrays the the models in his  videos as being under 18 he was but but you can kill but you can because usually they were at least  30. they were they were adults but how come that why aren't they charging people with child murder  who fucking who kill a kid in a drama well why aren't they charging uh people with murder who  are committing murders and horror films yeah you're depicting it actually got convicted on that  point yeah that that was thrown out it says here in 2007 max was indicted uh on ted counts of federal 
[03:53:00]  obscenity charges disgusting and he was found guilty of all charges uh sentenced to 46 months  in prison how is there a federal obscenity it's fucking i mean i know it's like  what it's disgusting i gotta leave the country like roman polanski because they love him in france  even if you think max is gross or whatever the bottom line is if he falls some they're going  after stalliano now they're gonna keep they're gonna go after jules george they're gonna go after  all these fucking guys and it's fucking disgusting i agree that they should not be going after 
[03:53:30]  anybody that's not breaking laws however even some of the stuff max was max was doing was not  stuff that girls in the industry would even do a lot of yeah you're right a lot of them would not  work with max yeah and they do work with john and they do work with uh jules jordan of course and  that you know that's that's an acceptable level of hardcore some of the stuff max is doing with  tubes and speculums and vomit and it's gross you know what you're right to me a lot of it wasn't 
[03:54:00]  but it's it's it's adults making adult decisions yeah and it should the government  shouldn't interfere although again that being said i do believe one of the ones max got busted on  the girl was barely coherent what do you mean uh drunk so much she couldn't even talk  oh well yeah stops becoming consent at that point to me it becomes sexy  yeah but that's not obscenity that's that's that's that would probably be a different crime  yeah yeah that's exactly very good jim yeah don't get me wrong boys you're a good counselor 
[03:54:30]  we agree people get in trouble for doing movies however if you put yourself out there and push  the envelope as far as you can if he was drugging women and things like that and then filming them  and stuff that's different than an obscenity uh uh law that's ridiculous were specifically with  possibly bodily excrements and also fisting i believe there was things with full hands it should  all be legal i mean max has little hands i think i even remember watching a uh okay what's his name  nacho has a bigger cock than max doesn't own sure sure but laws are laws and you know what they are 
[03:55:00]  before you do stuff yes but you're right but a lot of them are fucking uh are arbitrarily uh  oh i agree i don't think we should have a dmv but you know that's just me i'm hugely libertarian  but i also say if you know what the law is and you break it you can't but that's just it there's this  what law it's very hard to say what kind of law like what what's that uh uh ruling on obscenity  i i can't define it but i know what it is when i see it yeah i can't define it but i know pornography 
[03:55:30]  yeah exactly and like what about uh anal sex is illegal in a lot of states because they say it's uh  it's how they keep gays from from living together and marrying it's it's an age-old law in the books  yeah by definition totally wrong by definition everybody in porn should look at anal sex and go  well we know the law we can't do it huh well not in california luckily in california it's completely  legal to shoot porn and and also to have lots of anal sex but you don't streets no no well no not on  the streets i think there are public indecency laws see there's all different laws no katie what i'm 
[03:56:00]  saying is that law those movies are being sent to states where anal sex and oral sex are illegal  they're both considered sodomy so if if by that standard like if you have to hey you know the  law don't do it that you know what i mean then they should be getting arrested for that because  i mean if you think about it like uh alabama made sex toys illegal so don't go shipping sex toys to  alabama just because you can buy it shit call that package back it's like they're there are a big box  of dildos that have to be respected no reason it's law overnight move somewhere else or vote and change 
[03:56:30]  the law all right change the law exactly all right well listen the movie zach and mary you're in it  and uh oh i haven't seen it yet but i hope that you are one of the stars this is max hardcore's  latest movie zach and oh no uh no i got confused zach and mary is a speculum  and your urethra max is a naughty boy we love kevin we love his latest movie and why don't you keep  talking yeah all right and katie morgan it was a pleasure uh zach and mary make a porno it opens uh 
[03:57:00]  this friday friday friday everybody go out opening weekend it is one of the  funniest movies you've probably seen in a while you're very bubbly all right yes that's me i'm  percy and punctual all right okay we'll talk to you soon okay all right boys have a good one  all right all right all right but you know what you can tell like even though like she'll she'll  say the right thing she's happy he got busted you can hear it oh yeah a lot of girls really  hated max because he is violent but you know what he's he he changed the business to a certain 
[03:57:30]  degree and people love what it should not be an obscenity law that was broken that he goes to jail  for if it's other things like yeah drugging women whatever uh that's one thing uh uh putting  things over state lines or something i don't know i just don't see how consenting adults uh on film  doing horrible things regardless of what it is is uh unless it's murder or or a real a crime i think  i remember watching a max hardcore scene and like after the scene was over like you know she's cleaned 
[03:58:00]  up and dressed and everything and like he's actually interviewing her and like asking her questions like  you know i know that we did stuff but you know it was all consensual and she's like oh yeah of  course you know he was sweet because you had it well because he had he had to like let the viewer  know that like this wasn't like a real thing that was happening these are just actors in a porno movie  just like they did the scarface you have to pacino murder all those people it's fucking makes me  so it's and this is where the conservatives need to shut their motherfucking mouths this is where  that we don't let government uh conservatives get their dick in everybody's fucking face and it makes me 
[03:58:30]  sick this is where the republicans are horrible not that the democrats advocate yeah believe me  they don't target it they're another batch that would just uh their political correctness has  gotten way out of hand where where for different reasons they end up with the same result like let's  get rid of this stuff they won't target porn but they won't they won't back it either but they won't  go after it like that they'll have plenty of people that'll uh target it as uh offensive for or or  dangerous if children are in the house for some reason it always comes out of the goddamn
