<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly from one subject to another.  It began with a discussion about the commercialization of Christmas and the often-ignored darker aspects of Thanksgiving, including the brutal treatment of Native Americans and a critical assessment of Christopher Columbus.  A caller, Travis, contributed to this by mentioning seeing a Christmas tree up incredibly early in the year.  This segued into a discussion about Opie and Anthony’s own exhaustion, hilariously embellished with a recounting of a homoerotic encounter between Opie and Travis involving close physical proximity and shared sleep.

The conversation then jumped to *Boardwalk Empire*, JG Melon's hamburgers, restaurants with deliberately bad service, and a nostalgic look at inappropriate t-shirts from the 90s, including Big Johnson and nude shirts. Opie then shared graphic details from his online research into "smelly vaginas," leading to a discussion of various vaginal health issues and related humorous anecdotes.  This unexpectedly transitioned into a discussion about fish, focusing on tilapia, Chilean sea bass, fish farms, and the renaming of less desirable fish.  A sea robin joke led to a discussion of family nicknames. The segment concluded with a bizarre discussion of a bestiality Twitter account and a proposed hidden-camera prank involving a massage therapist and gas, along with brief mentions of Anderson Cooper, a heavy metal Gangnam Style, and Roger Daltry.

The next segment began with a discussion of pornography, followed by a poorly-delivered bestiality joke from a caller named Will from Nevada. This led to a critique of sports talk radio, praising only Joe Benigno. The show then tackled the conflict in the Gaza Strip, featuring callers representing both the pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel perspectives.  After this serious discussion, the show abruptly shifted to a caller inquiring about the cost of hiring a prostitute, with Jimmy providing an answer based on his experience. This was followed by a discussion of Lindsey Stone's controversial middle finger photo at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

The show then descended into a frustrating phone call with frequent caller Bobo, who repeatedly complained about not being on the show despite being on the air, failing to offer any substantial content.  A fabricated call from Mark Zuckerberg was staged to no avail.  This segment concluded with a discussion of the Hostess Twinkies bankruptcy, Greg Gutfeld’s Twinkie milkshake, and various potentially dangerous food combinations.

The following segment began with a discussion on corporate greed and executive compensation, which unexpectedly veered into a fascination with Twinkie shakes, prompted by the Hostess bankruptcy.  A video of a banana-and-Sprite vomiting challenge was played.  Greg Gutfeld then joined the show in studio to promote his book, "The Joy of Hate," discussing phony outrage, political correctness, and media double standards.  Anecdotes were shared about past appearances, including an intern urinating incident, baby powder used by lap dancers, and Bob from "The Five"'s Twinkie milkshake consumption. The conversation covered the Hostess bankruptcy, Occupy Wall Street, the Tea Party, smoking, and the hypocrisy of political discourse.

A later segment focused on the 2012 US Presidential election, Mitt Romney's perceived weaknesses, the impact of Hurricane Sandy, political correctness, accusations of racism, and the hypocrisy in political discourse, using examples of Al Sharpton and David Duke.  Greg Gutfeld was again present, promoting his book and using blurred-out male nipples on wanted posters as a metaphor for fake outrage. The segment also included listener calls featuring vulgar language, interactions with Twitter followers (including Sam Roberts being compared to Sideshow Bob), Bobo’s repeated requests to be on the show, and the hosts' reflections on their past controversies, including the "WOW" stunt with the Today Show.  Carly Rae Jepsen's lack of acknowledgment towards the show for promoting her was also mentioned, along with listener anecdotes about show references appearing in other media, such as WWE.

The final segment featured a prank call Opie made to Dr. Steve of "Weird Medicine," posing as "Ronnie" with a bizarre medical complaint.  The prank was revealed, highlighting inconsistencies in Ronnie's claimed location and area code.  Numerous calls from Kenny followed, providing updates, plugging his Facebook page, and criticizing Dr. Steve’s behavior and voicemail messages. One of Dr. Steve’s bizarre voicemail messages was played. The hosts discussed Kenny’s long calls, with Sam expressing both fondness and annoyance. The segment concluded with promotions for Troy's mixtape, various websites, and a Thanksgiving Eve party.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  but enough of this palaver let's get the show on the road it's not joyous not joyous at all  joy us it's not joyous i love joyous holiday seasons i was telling anthony why can't we have  different holidays every year it's the same shit everyone makes believe it's not but it's just the  same shit every year it has gotten better because i have kids but i was driving home yesterday and  the giant fucking red christmas balls are on sixth avenue the same shitty trees in this lobby  the same fucking russian asshole is setting up his tree stands for the trees in my neighborhood 
[00:00:30]  it's the same shit people love familiarity why i don't know why can't we mix it up a little bit  you look you go i remember that from last year we have absolutely no creative creativity as human  beings we just follow fucking tracks and do the same shit i don't know sorry good morning everybody  kind of happy about uh christmas coming up i got actually angie and uh and company got my tree up  in my house it's all festive already you got a christmas tree in your house already what's wrong 
[00:01:00]  with you you know you hate people no i love christmas let me tell you why because uh angie and keith  their house is pretty much destroyed so in order to you know feel a little better and get away from her  house and stuff she decorated for christmas a little early which is fine that certainly makes sense but do  you have the same christmas uh decorations every year you know why inside i got a few new ones  outside completely different than last year all right now five years ago it's a whole new company 
[00:01:30]  now you're talking with they're coming today to finish it up with the cherry pickers and and  throwing all kinds of shit all over my house my catholic house in my jew neighborhood  my thing is though it just feels like the same exact thing year after year after year that's pretty much  called uh what do they call it christmas that's right life well not well i try to move in different  tracks yeah that's what i try to do sometimes you're a rebel exact same fucking you know way to long 
[00:02:00]  island i'll i'll take a few turns here's some new ones that i can know that would be nazi uh christmas  swastika uh christmas wonderful people out there you did ignore my invitation when i did my uh leap year  party my every four leap fourth uh party none of you guys showed up that's true i forgot it was  leap year that it's amazing it's everybody comes over and we just play that song jump and we all leap  about my house that's terrible that's a fun party does it seem a little early for this christmas stuff 
[00:02:30]  though um they're jumping the gun a little bit they are but they do pre-thanksgiving shit you're right  when we were growing up you didn't dare put a christmas thing out until after thanks after  thanks after you saw santi claus in the parade then you're like oh okay now the christmas season  has now come out now they're like fuck that we gotta sell some shit let's get this uh party started  so pretty much right after halloween you start seeing the that's it you start seeing christmas  and now it's roosevelt field travis who are you i'm travis hi travis i was at roosevelt 
[00:03:00]  field mall on november 2nd congrats yeah well lucky lucky for you and no one else can get there  and they had their they had their christmas tree out they did already november 2nd that's just  stupid yeah it's crazy it's just dumb that's because they want you to buy stuff they want  more shopping days right well if you go to a mall and you see christmas stuff uh you know around then  you'll buy more that's the that's the logic there i think thanksgiving has taken kind of a backseat 
[00:03:30]  too like like thanksgiving's not as big a holiday as it used to be with people so um so they move  christmas up a little bit thanksgiving kind of is just there thanksgiving's early this year right  uh is it does it consider early that's why this doesn't make sense yeah maybe that's it because  i it's usually a little later in the month yeah yeah a little later it feels like it should be one  week after now yeah it's gonna be the 22nd this year right because that's crazy i don't mind a little  thanksgiving too i get to go over the family's house we laugh we drink some wine we have some fun 
[00:04:00]  we um i i went to meditation last night can't you tell as i'm out of the box with aggression  and uh it brought it to the surface and one of the gurus over there a guru i'll say one of the gurus  was uh wishing us all a happy thanksgiving but she was having a tough time with it because you know  she knows what it really means how we came over and completely destroyed every indian that lived on the  east coast she goes but you know you go to the the rest of america and you certainly still see  indigenous people yes but you don't see any uh up and down the east coast now do you they fucking 
[00:04:30]  kicked their asses thanksgiving over that mississippi thanksgiving meant well for a few days she she said  it was a it was a beautiful uh celebration i thought we had the cornucopia and the um turkey and and stuff  and then and the pilgrims um were shaking hands at the indians and we all sat down at tables and  and ate i have seen is so fake but i all i want to say is this i understand what needed to be done 
[00:05:00]  but let's not sugarcoat it i i always hated that growing up things that are sugarcoated you do  delicious flakes like look at this beautiful painting of really of what it looked like  that is the indians are are so grateful they're kind of you know uh sitting down they've copped a  squat much like they do when they eat and uh the uh normal smart people are sitting at tables right  and look they're all serving that like the white ladies are serving the indians food right and they're  like hey uh-huh uh-huh and they're taking a little bite and the dog is there barking right our red-skinned 
[00:05:30]  friends yes it's a friendly festive occasion the painting says it all see look at the white  pilgrim woman speaking with the squat in the background that's nice she's probably saying how do you get your  vaginal lips so legendarily fat i've heard their meat here and the girl's going hi hi hi from jim  norton the first i mean you know that might i don't i don't even think that went down well of course  why can't we teach that we had to kick their their asses to take over this place because it was a 
[00:06:00]  bountiful land needed this shit you know thanksgiving is thanksgiving is like the governor on walking dead  coming back and telling everybody that's something that you know they were the heroes and yeah  that's exactly hey don't worry everything's good let's just get up there tell a story everything's  gonna be fine fine you think when christopher columbus like put his head down at night he  felt a little guilt just a little guilt going geez i didn't discover shit fucking explorer slash  conqueror you didn't feel guilt you loved it there were millions of people here already i didn't 
[00:06:30]  discover anything that's your job yeah discover yeah i just discovered this journey  but he felt like he did for the queen though like he felt like he did for spain or whatever  that yeah that's he felt like he did his job he did his job they fucking took ships that you didn't  know what the fuck was gonna happen might go over the edge you just topped in and and head off  that's a ballsy ass move you make it sound like columbus and his guys come over here which is  different than the pilgrims i know i don't want to hear from people they just didn't even the same 
[00:07:00]  i know but it started with columbus that's all i'm trying to say but it's like thank you you  don't understand it wasn't like these pussies came over on the goddamn uh uh norwegian cruise  liner that would have been nice and shit why didn't they know if they were even gonna make it and  then when they did and they find shit it felt like hey you know i'm entitled to a little piece here  get your fucking ass a little further west and i'm sick of hearing that you know there was risk  involved because they didn't know if they would go over the edge yeah if you see the edge wouldn't 
[00:07:30]  you fucking turn around a little bit they did or is it kind of like the top of a waterfall where  it just starts getting faster and faster and you're not going to be able to turn it around  they thought the horizon was the edge for a while i understand that crazy but if it but if it was the  actual edge you wouldn't go over the side well you had warning with the uh sea monsters right there  so you didn't just go over the edge first you had to battle the uh giant uh squid and octopus  gotcha and the big lochinus monster looking thing and if you got past that you got past that then  you're just falling off the edge anyways gotcha yeah they have warnings so she uh unwillingly last 
[00:08:00]  night uh wished us all thanksgiving but she she's uncomfortable with what well what went on who's  comfy with that huh who's comfy with the whole thing i'm very comfy about that we wouldn't be here  yeah i don't know what the fuck happened before i was alive who gives a fuck thanksgiving doesn't  bother me as much as columbus day because thanksgiving i think is about more than it is more  you know we're celebrating it's become about being thankful for what we are and what we have i don't  i don't think necessarily of the history whereas with columbus day i feel like they're celebrating 
[00:08:30]  something that they we probably should at least teach more accurately yeah thanksgiving i think is a  bigger yeah you're thankful you get your family everybody's stuffing you got your turkey turkey  your cranberry sauce and 20 legs of lamb you don't think the engines and the uh the pilgrims actually  got along right that's just maybe like for a second no what about what about fucking uh what about the  pocahontas and uh john smith uh you know what they hung they got some fucking there's commonality in 
[00:09:00]  some fucking let's see you know what john smith's like that fat vag lip fucking pocahontas yeah he saw  that bulging her papoose he called it his name was actually john smith norton little did they know  i'm a big fan of the native american women yeah i see native american in your bio and i'm like i'm in  you're in you're all in right you look like it's half scalped i fucking do it should look like an 
[00:09:30]  injury turns me on fucking tomahawk wound i'm a big fan of those ladies uh but thanksgiving right  around the corner certainly yeah that's uh that's nice like that it's uh what they call short week  yeah no kidding a very short week because i don't even remember doing a show yesterday i barely have  any recollection of being here yesterday i told anthony we had one of those rare ones where we  were both fucking exhausted very hard those shows yeah yeah thank god for bill burr the burr roll

[00:31:00]  craft a tweet with uh fucking smelly vaginas and then i i gave up because i was deep into smelly  vaginas reading about them last night smelly i mean how many characters is that right there just  smelly vaginas exactly i was trying to come up with uh what it's called what vaginosis vaginosis right  bacteria vaginosis bacteria vaginosis i think bacterial vaginosis that's what i learned yes i thought there  was a fancier name than that yeah no that's when there's a fluid build up a lot of times it will  be caused by a by yeast or the ph balance being off and oh her body will sweat and that will cause 
[00:31:30]  vaginosis you're thinking of um constant right any seepage yeah seepage a lot of times the underpants  will be ruined and then the other thing i thought about yesterday because i was i was like i said in  this meditation class anything worse than dry stale breath when you can smell it on somebody else i'm  not really i'm not talking about bad breath that dry just stale yeah i'll tell you what i do and my 
[00:32:00]  ex had the greatest name for it i won't i won't say it on air because it's just it's what it's whatever  but it was just a really brilliant accurate word she was the greatest at describing smells really  yeah did it did it fit or what what she used to she she also called it talking breath which is is uh  when someone talks too much and their mouth gets dry but it just oh yes of course man of course 
[00:32:30]  course but it just summed it right wow oh i got nervous the stinker just talked out of his ass  but yeah that's that dry horrible and some people have it all the time just like always  it's not necessarily a bad breath it's just oh my god everyone's doing their stupid breathing i'm like  the room was filling up with a dry stale breath oh you smell the dry medication oh it was horrendous 
[00:33:00]  yeah then i had the fluttering eyes again last night and then she was out of her mind going oh  my god that only happens to people that have grown up in the culture what i don't know what does that  mean my eyes flutter when i meditate i guess that's a that's a transfer of energy i'm feeling a lot of  energy i don't know i don't know what the fuck i'm doing i'm not going to sit here and make believe  i do how long is my every time i tell her my experiences she's like she freaks out like oh my god we  gotta study you study i was uh i don't know like 20 25 minutes no how about how long is the class an 
[00:33:30]  hour hour kept my eyes try to keep your eyes shut for an hour straight while you're awake it's almost  impossible yeah i did last night because she talks and stuff and there's chanting and just setting up  the room i'm like all right i'm closing my eyes right now and i won't open them for an hour try to do  that i can't do it now that was my that we should try to do it how long you think you can last what 
[00:34:00]  did you shut my eyes you'd be paranoid though that somebody's doing something now i fall asleep  i'm like a cat jimmy have you seen the pig on the on the uh elliptical yet that where's the the i'm  gonna sweat more fucking uh sweatsuit no got the hefty bags the girl no i almost pulled out my camera  and i didn't give a fuck if they threw it threw me out of our gym yesterday she's moaning huffing  and puffing she fat yeah right next to me what the fuck you're not the only one in the fucking gym 
[00:34:30]  moaning and then huffing and puffing breathing really hard nice what is that about i don't know  why can't you keep it to yourself why do people think that they're the only fucking people alive  working hard maybe you get to a point of being tired i took a class after i i'll be able to bump  each other in the gym and i took a a half hour ab class and then after that there's an hour class  but i can only get through a half hour of it of like jumping around like doing like um football drills  right cardio and once you i get to i'm so fucking beat up like even during the abs you start going 
[00:35:00]  like ah no and i didn't care who heard me like i mean i don't try to do that is the whole room doing  it no uh a couple people i was panting so hard i'm like oh i just can't do that i was just so beaten  by this fucking exercise like i'm so i was so mad at this lady last night and then she's like she's  and she's been at the gym forever she might she just she should quit because she's the exact same 
[00:35:30]  size does she punch she fucking she it's the elliptical machine so she'll go really fast for 30 seconds  screaming and yelling and fucking moaning and huffing and puffing and and these things because  it's new york city you're on top of each other there's no room for anything so you're right next  to the fucking person yeah i don't know and then uh she'll stop to get her breath again and then  she'll start up again i i wanted to film her so bad i gotta get a hidden camera i gotta fucking do 
[00:36:00]  some upskirting i mean i gotta upskirt i saw some woman who have to film her who is heavy who is uh  punching the fucking speed bag outside and they said she's there for years that's her yeah i don't  know and she was fat i'm like what is she doing she's here for years i don't know yeah so that was  my dumb day yesterday i guess i always see a certain sports guy and i don't want to say his name because  i don't you know uh on our we we watch him a lot he's uh he's a sports announcer and we see him at the  gym and i know i say hi to him he's a miserable fuck dude he never even said like i've seen him i want to 
[00:36:30]  say hey we know the same people i know who you're talking about he's one reason why i'm in  broadcasting oh because there was a time i want i wasn't sure if i wanted to go into sports uh  broadcasting or whatever and he was one of one of the guys i looked up to when i was growing up ww  yeah yeah of course but he's not he's a legend but i've met him and he's in he's at shows at the  cellar at times he's a great guy so i'm like he's why is he maybe he just doesn't when he's on tv  well you know what he's a lot like regis regis uh works out at our gym too and when regis is not 
[00:37:00]  that fun loving going on letterman doing the stupid bank commercials guy he's an  asshole and he's a miserable fuck in my humble opinion i've seen him a hundred times how about  just spot me you spook he walks around completely like monotone uh i don't know if that's the best  way to describe it but not much emotion going on his face doesn't talk to anyone walks around 
[00:37:30]  completely miserable in the neighborhood and then you see him on tv and you're like that's the same  fucking guy there's no way and this guy that you're talking about is the same way i told you he's bonk  goes but i've talked to him in person before and he was really nice like i years ago at the cellar he  came and we spoke after and he couldn't have been friendly or something maybe he's just  weird at the gym or maybe he doesn't like to be bothered when he's like i don't think you  recognize me because i wear a hood when i work out so i didn't take it personally i just said hi  and he just made believe i didn't talk i'm like really you're one of those guys that's just 
[00:38:00]  wonderful he brings his uh little lunch to the gym too every day sits down with his little sandwich  bag and his little soda he pulls out really i just expect a little more from this guy he's been  forever i love the food there love it i eat every day well he's trying to save a little money  i think why else would you bring your food dude i love to sit there and have some nice chicken or some  fish is tilapia bad for you no you mentioned that dan you said tilapia before tilapia is a good  that's an all right it's a good fish right it's all right i'll eat it is it healthy i mean all 
[00:38:30]  fish is healthy unless you got the swordfish is bad the mercury mercury in it yeah radiation after we  had that talk i was asking the people behind that counter is tilapia a swordfish i don't know what  it is tilapia swordfish i don't know if it's a swordfish no no no looks like a bass okay yeah  mole like a good fish that's tilapia that's tilapia it's delicious never knew that  vegetable juice the fucking vegetable juice gives you horrible gas 
[00:39:00]  dude you think my gas is bad you've never seen anything worse than me trying to keep my  asshole shut while trying to guide a massage therapist's fingers oh no yeah it's fucking  awful i've had a struggle i've had a few very close calls oh imagine just a hot  a part of me wants to do it one time and film a hidden camera massage and cut gassers  i want to do that so bad because there's so many times i could  i think that'll be a hilarious video fucking hilarious that's the best part ever by the way 
[00:39:30]  what not the noisy ones no the one that goes the hot ones yeah it's just hot they cup your balls for a  second yeah you get your balls it's not just the smell it the air actually gets a texture to it  going into your nostrils it's terrible like fucking smells like a refinery  well everyone knows who we're talking about but whatever yeah i just don't want to say where he  works out but but he's a pleasant guy when i've spoken to him so it didn't like i said i didn't take 
[00:40:00]  it no i want to just say hey man we know the same guys and uh you know you're one of the  reasons why i'm in broadcasting if you said it certainly is one of the reasons why i'm in  broadcasting if you said because i'm bad at recognizing people too if you said hey man  it's opie he would probably stop and go hey man and talk to you i don't know i had to do my  impression of him oh like uh what's his name did when you were with me on columbus avenue he was  going for the big blow off and i go no man opie from open that thing and then strahan stopped and  talked for a minute or two but he didn't want anything to do with anyone saying hi to him sometimes 
[00:40:30]  they just like keep it he's one of those guys now that he's especially that he's on kelly by the  way i love the guy i like i'm not trashing him he fake looks at his his phone when he's walking just  so people don't bother him because he's probably getting stopped everywhere he goes 20 people  probably stopping him like i love the show and what about when you had uh george clooney on and he's  all right right so these guys act like they're doing i told you kevin baker was walking on columbus  avenue one time holding a cell phone to his head i'm like i bet he's fake talking just so no one  bothers him and i'm and i'm the complete opposite uh i'll i'll hang with a fan to the point where 
[00:41:00]  they're uncomfortable want to leave because it doesn't happen as much as it used to i'll run into  i run into one one a day easy and sometimes i'm like i'll give away too much time and he's like  what the fuck dude i just want to say dude i love the show cool what are you doing now  yeah right he busy oh my god see he admitted it they're not as popular as they used to be i've 
[00:41:30]  been saying this for seven years and i finally got the answer i've been telling you guys why don't i  post this that is i have done that a few times yeah like wow what we already did the picture i said  hi and i just want to go home now yeah yeah i'll talk to somebody once in a while it's it's a weird  i'm always and i've said this before i'm always surprised when we have black fans even if it says 
[00:42:00]  stand up i don't know why i am yeah but like uh i guess like yeah i was in a on the road with kenny  and i was in a whole foods and black guy came up to me young dude in his 20s and he's like uh he's  like hey man i'm a really big fan of the show nice no you're not you can't be i was like well  two of us would appreciate that yes two out of three is not bad i was like thanks and i don't  know why it feels like like i'm really happy to know that i guess because we we just don't see as  many black fans well you're hoping that your um humor or your dialogue whatever you're doing 
[00:42:30]  translates that whole thing yeah of uh you know race yeah when women say it too it's even a little  bit more like when white guys say because i guess that's you know i i'm not as surprised when i hear  a black guy or a woman or somebody ethnic it's like oh that's nice i'm glad it doesn't come off that  fucking yeah or a chinese person who doesn't even speak english right you got me you got me of that  why the groundhog uh clip i love that movie oh just about spending too much time with uh a stranger 
[00:43:00]  you know like ned ryerson exactly because then that's what bill murray does when he flips it on him  and just you know i don't know where you're going but can you call and say yeah play that  but this is like the all of the scenes like splice i've never seen that whole movie are you kidding  dude i've watched part of it and i really liked it but for whatever reason it uh you know ned ryerson  was this is a story i haven't told this is a story i haven't told in years but so i'll make it really  but i'll make it quick ned ryerson was living in uh our neighborhood for a while because he was doing 
[00:43:30]  a broadway show or a film yeah i saw him walking around all the time at columbus avenue in the 70s  and every time i saw him i would go ned ned ryerson would he acknowledge it he laughed once and  then he fucking was done with it he was done with it and i would do it all the fucking time i  would be i would be with people and i see him coming i'm like that's the guy from groundhog's  day how many people must say of course of course i'm not saying that i'm an original that's so  good though that's so many yeah he's in a ton of stuff i've seen him in so many things yeah he was in 
[00:44:00]  he was uh sammy jenkins in memento yeah oh yeah exactly that was probably his best role  another dead bird mystery huh what's that about dead birds mystery again  they're just dropping dead again yeah we get this every once in a while  fucking birds birds enough of the birds uh i'm getting a couple of tweets uh tilapia is a garbage  fish catch fish farms use them to clean the tanks all right tilapia is a bottom feeder which is why 
[00:44:30]  they're cheap not the best choice for earring fish you think i wrote well i read a a good article  on fishing a while back a while back and uh we've pretty much eaten all the really good fish  so then like these uh these places had to get creative so they started like tilapia and dog  face fish it used to be called but then they they named it uh they they they get they give these  fishes romantic names yeah you don't want to order the dog face fish and what happened was they got  desperate so they started these were fish uh way back in the day they would just throw back 
[00:45:00]  they had no interest in but now because we've we we've fished the waters to the point where there's  not enough of the good around they they now catch the bad shit they give it a fancy name and they and  they get a bunch of spices and sauces involved with these fish and people are eating it looks like  a dog fish it's crazy but what is that now called like chili and sea bass or something like that  no i eat that all the time i do too i don't want it to be dog face no chili and uh sea bass yeah  that was a fish that no one ate it's good that shit is righteous but it's highly prepared and stuff 
[00:45:30]  it's really good i like chili and sea bass i had sea bass last night somebody somebody help me out  with this it's all prepared the same way tilapia is a shit-eating fish get a trout dog have a clam  witch uh i can't clap anymore i don't know it's still good for you but you'll have a lobster right i mean  it's the same no i it's funny i did eat a piece of lobster last night i do not eat lobster you ate  it last night i was at i del frisco's with a bunch of the comics went out uh norm invited us out to 
[00:46:00]  eat so we went out and had uh nice had a nice dinner so bob kelly for the first time in a month  how's he looking it's good i mean same you know damn bobby yeah i just caved in and split a dessert  with bobby and his wife and a few other people can't not eat you'll lose a hand  yeah you you're a dessert boy i try i've been really good but it's like when there's that many  fucking dumb keith robinson is eating bread you ever eat banana bread pudding that's ridiculous  oh fuck man i've never had it stuff don't go to magnolias right in our neighborhood you could get 
[00:46:30]  the best uh banana bread pudding ever right in our fucking neighborhood two blocks from where you're  living but it's like you get so obsessive with like working out and it's like you know i'm i'm  fucking uh i'm so sick of looking terrible then you know you think you're like okay uh i'm gonna  fucking punish myself for a couple of days because the holidays are coming so i know i'm gonna eat  bad then i eat bad i can't even enjoy it it's like i feel all i do is go home and pinch my fat it's  like just shut up enjoy it how's your vagina i think it stinks it's leaking to fucking tilapia 
[00:47:00]  and lemon butt cake it's a garbage pussy that's why those pussies smell their bottom feeders  okay thank you people are helping me with the fish thing i hate when we talk about shit that  i don't know i thought about years ago and then you got to kind of like get all your info together  quickly uh tilapia was originally an african lake fish i am with no real name and then they give it  a white fish brought it over but then you give it a name like tilapia it's like oh that sounds sounds 
[00:47:30]  good and then the patagonian tile fish is now sold as chili and sea bass okay but it's not like a  fucking dog face fish yeah but dog face dog face fish is another one i know maybe that someone somebody  helped me out with dog face fish what it's now called um yeah but if you saw tile fish on the  menu that doesn't sound oh maybe that's why okay that doesn't sound like something you would order  but chili and sea bass that's like oh nice it's amazing that i'm actually care now why do i care 
[00:48:00]  i enjoy the fish right it's gutted and cleaned and what do i think i'm gonna find a little fish feed  in it it's a really it's a really bland fish it's all how it's not that creepy which one is that that's  the uh tooth fish the patagonian tile fish no it says tooth fish it was saying tooth fish  oh okay maybe this guy's got it wrong that looks like the fish heads fish heads right roll leaf  holy fish head yeah everyone's saying uh oh you know what a bunch that guy got it wrong a bunch of 
[00:48:30]  people saying it is the patagonian tooth fish wow it's now chili and sea bass but you see what i  mean they had to change the name so you would eat it but you know what that's why that encourages me  because that thing has some fucking teeth because he knows he's fucking delicious yeah nature gave  that thing teeth because everything would eat it look at him i know i'm yummy i'll take nixon  maa got a big mouth maa see maa maa maa edward g robinson mouth  they are tasty i do like a good chilean sea bass

[00:50:00]  shit right yeah we have that conversation it's a sea robin yeah i eat it those are actually really  good but no one eats them why aren't they sold the restaurant they're they're a nuisance um why  are they a nuisance because there's so many of them what uh this is just they're they're overpopulated  you could fish them there's no what if they're gonna eat who cares why would why would it be a  nuisance um i don't know that's like saying tuna's a nuisance well it's it's because it's not a nuisance  people people like to when they think they're eating a fish they like to think that they're eating

[01:02:30]  niners won i'm saying he's got a good good team he did that awful joke fucking eight times yeah  because he was so he felt so good about it sports radio is rough to listen to it stinks that guy's  terrible sports radio stinks it's rough maybe after uh you know after the weekend on a monday listen for  an hour or two i couldn't get that but on a wednesday or thursday when nothing's really happening i  don't know how the fuck people listen to that you know i like joe benigno is the only guy i can listen 
[01:03:00]  to because he's a jet fan and a met fan but he's a real fucking fan and he gets really emotional when  they lose and he screams and he reacts like a real fan does that's why i like benigno the rest of them  just bore me they're all neutral benigno's a fucking i used to like steve summers he's a good  broadcaster but i get he was doing the overnight yeah schmoozing under the covers till imus in the  morning i used to listen to him on the way home from bb i believe that was the time right and every once  in a while he would he would have seinfeld on because yeah yeah and also he was just getting 
[01:03:30]  these interviews with seinfeld and seinfeld would come in every once in a while that's pretty cool  it was really cool that doesn't happen to anybody i'm um yeah fan got me through when we were off the  radio and i was riding around looking at prostitutes all night i couldn't listen to anything i would  listen to art bell and i would listen to what what benigno did on the overnights at fan so it's like i  do have i guess an affection for that kind of sports radio right on so you got uh you got the 
[01:04:00]  thing happening there in the gaza strip yes yo and you got all the reporters going over there and uh  we're gonna lose one we're gonna lose you think we're gonna lose a reporter yeah they do like being  in the action they do like uh getting the one up on the other report thank you it's like hurricane  footage when you have to like when they have to like broadcast from in the middle of the ocean and  right and then tell everyone don't try this exactly well they're doing the same shit and then you know  they want bombs to explode while they're live absolutely and one of them is going to get get 
[01:04:30]  one in the fucking noggin they love being able to say you've you just heard that yes that was an  explosion very frightening clear over so when you hear the story that uh you know one of these guys  was taken out don't feel sorry for them no they're getting as close as possible for the ratings yes they  are and one uh was pretty close to anderson cooper yesterday there is one report now saying 11 uh  people were killed in that blast but we know 10 members of one family also two media centers uh built 
[01:05:00]  that was a rather large explosion um that occurred just look out here in his ass i can't actually see  where the input that was uh it's actually set off a number of car alarms car alarms of course there you go  you know what that's pretty close as much as we shit on reporters and they are tabloid a lot of  them there is a real bravery to this oh man these like the way he even reacted like i would have been  hiding into the fucking console yeah but there's no reason to be that duck pretty good there's absolutely 
[01:05:30]  no reason to be that close it's stupidity you know what though i mean if you could hear that going  off you're okay because that's true right because if you did you'd just be dead you wouldn't know  you wouldn't even know right it'd be so dead whose fault is this one even oh god are you going to  open up that can of worms i mean this particular uh i heard that they were lobbying hamas shells yeah  hamas apparently fired the first shot it was a uh a missile that they shot at an israeli vehicle that 
[01:06:00]  was in israel so israel responded by trying to systematically take out every one of hamas's missile  launchers and missiles by the way these missiles are supplied by iran of course and iran this a lot  of people saying israel is using this as an excuse um to wipe out hamas's missiles because hamas is 
[01:06:30]  merely a puppet of iran and if iran decided uh if uh israel decided to try to take out those uh nuclear  plants in iran hamas would absolutely be lobbing missiles into jerusalem and tel aviv and whatnot  under the orders of iran right so this could be a lead up to an iranian um air strike to try to  clear the missiles out before they do that so that they don't get the full bombardment um wow that 
[01:07:00]  seems to be but hamas absolutely and and whether israel was looking for an excuse or not they got one  when hamas blew up one of the israeli vehicles uh in israel now this is not the um the same as the  the shells that was the syrian or turkish shells that had fallen over right yeah yeah that oh this  is a different insult this is totally different it's um the uh hamas in gaza uh i mean they've been  going at it forever what was happening with the blockade because actually noam who's very pro-israel  was saying that there was a block there's a blockade in place and hamas wanted the blockade 
[01:07:30]  like you know it's to keep weapons from coming in yeah exactly but a part of it was that they were  actually limiting the amount of chocolate and there was some weird things they were doing in  the blockade that was bothering them maybe somebody knows about that because i don't obviously that's  why i threw it out i'm not a complete fucking apologist or israeli fucking um a guy here but  the truth of the matter is when you're in that situation where you're surrounded by people that 
[01:08:00]  absolutely want you've done gone wiped off the face of the earth you have to do things to  maintain your safety what they've done they've built walls they've they've blockaded certain  things because the weapons come in unfortunately if the chocolate is coming in with a busload of  fucking weapons sorry the chocolate ain't gonna fucking make it in no no but was that maybe that's  what it was i don't know if that's what the motive i what what it was i don't know what  the hamas uh palestinians um i'm sorry they're despicable fucking people and whether they feel 
[01:08:30]  that their sovereign rights have been infringed upon by israel um try to sort it out because  this ain't working for the past many fucking years i don't know who who does it belong to  it was given to israel uh after world war ii uh sorry and then when when incursions started  happening israel started branching out with buffer zones which were deemed illegal but tolerated to 
[01:09:00]  a point they gave some back they took some they needed some uh buffer zones to to keep the the violence  out of their country but that's an arguable point too did they go too far are they stretching out their  borders for more than just buffer zones um it's an argument that has no clear-cut answer especially  from this shock shock no but it's i'm trying to look at both sides of it yeah i'm so pro-israel 
[01:09:30]  but it's almost like are the palestinians really that completely as a group just unreasonable like  is it really that like we we think or is there's there more to it like well no the israelis  just fucked up here and there like you know uh yeah both sides have done their share of  fucking shenanigans that's for sure but it just seems like uh i don't know it seems like the  palestinians maybe i'm biased i don't know i i'm kind of am a an israel israel supporter there they 
[01:10:00]  have been a great ally in that area um but you're talking about your neighborhood my neighborhood yes  israel israel in nassau county yeah it's uh it seems like the palestinians are constantly  infringing but that could be because of how they view israel as you know interloper what a what an  exhausting way to live though terrible fuck i mean if this escalates we're going to start seeing all  those fucking israeli the the bus bombings and everything again i tried there hasn't been yeah 
[01:10:30]  that hasn't been in a while because they've had kind of this um ceasefire and treaty going on for  a while but i mean this shit breaks down every few years it happens they go they go to the mattresses  yeah i would love i wish somebody listening was knows more about it because i know the pro-israel  position because again most people i know are very pro-israel and they're very informed  but i would like to hear somebody who's pro-palestinian at least give a reasonable point  they absolutely feel like after world war ii their what was supposed to be their homeland was 
[01:11:00]  given to israel by the united nations and they feel like no you can't give away our you know part of  their religious um mecca if i could use a word is jerusalem right they consider that part of their holy  land and they feel like it was taken from them and given to the um israelis why don't we why don't  we get one from each side that usually works out pretty well give them some guns and let them get 
[01:11:30]  out we'll get a couple phone calls we've done this before yeah and then they could explain yeah to you  and each other what the problem is yeah so we need one from each side to call our show right now yeah  i don't want to be so so biased like that i'm being biased is fine if i have all the facts but it's like  i hear facts from intelligent people on both sides it's like yeah well we got one coming in right now  bill in kansas bill hello bill yeah hi bill i got a question for jimmy sure  jimmy uh just say you get a girl to come to your room spend a couple hours treat you good 
[01:12:00]  oh what would you expect to pay for something like that a couple hours it depends on where you go man  i mean i would say three 350 or 400 but for a couple of hours it might be more i i personally never  have done multiple hour sessions yeah well you know it's just just spent two hours uh treating me  good uh i might have got ripped off how much i figured i'd ask an expert how much did you pay 
[01:12:30]  700 350 an hour i wouldn't say you got ripped off was she really hot was it a great did she kiss you  a little bit she was really she kind of had an angelina joe leaf thing going all right well  why why did you do two hours as i do a little seattleist so i was uh i was good to go for a  couple hours oh how many times you bang her i'm sorry how many times did you bang her uh three  three times seven hundred um personally i would have just done an hour what did she charge for 
[01:13:00]  an hour was it 350. she just said she she needed 700 to come and uh and spend some time with me  oh she told me for about two hours if you want to spend all night i said no i don't have time for  all night all right well i wouldn't say you get ripped off because she did tell you up front how  much it was yeah um you know if she had said it's 300 and then two hours was 700 i'd say you got ripped  off but i wouldn't say you got ripped off sir i would say that uh hey look she told you the price  and you were willing to pay it and was it good did you enjoy it oh yeah you know what what's a good 
[01:13:30]  dinner date cost you know 150 to take a girl out to a really nice restaurant or 200 bucks i mean for  a five-star meal or whatever four-star meal most chicks you got to go out with two or three times  before you fuck them so it kind of comes out even okay yeah i feel a whole lot better about it now  yeah you just don't do it too much it's the holidays you treated yourself to a  fucking a good three loader treat yourself yeah i got it all right brother congratulations my  friend thank you all right now we got the phone call so we got uh eric eric you're in new jersey 
[01:14:00]  and you're pro-palestinian right yes sir hi eric all right hold on um i'm gonna go with akiva  who's uh pro-israel akiva meet eric good morning can we hear eric first yeah eric uh what do you got  on this whole issue well it's it's it's quite simple the palestinians have lived there for 
[01:14:30]  thousands of years and if if you look in the torah the ultra has um the ultra scene will tell you  jews are a religion they have no homeland they don't have a country of their own that's why they've  been scattered all throughout the world and next thing you know they're moving into palestine's  backyard building walls and told them they can't live there there was a goat farmer who's had that 
[01:15:00]  family for 2 000 years in his family and all of a sudden he can't live there anymore and if he comes  back he'll be shot uh can i have a chance to respond now yeah yeah okay okay cool yeah no i'm not  interested in getting to a shouting match but i don't know which uh torah he's referring to because  the torah that i believe in in the torah that i can quote uh clearly promises the land to abraham  isaac and jacob uh many times the law firm of israel conquers the land in not only uh in many many 
[01:15:30]  books of the uh of the of the old testament and establishes a monarchy there and then eventually  they're scattered once their temple is destroyed and the babylonians come in uh and and and then  followed that was the first time the temple is destroyed and then the romans kicked them out  the second time the temple is destroyed but we've always had presence there and we've uh we've  always we've always maintained uh a jewish even if it hasn't been a control of the state we've  always had a presence in that land we have not been spread out over the world and never had a country 
[01:16:00]  so you expect to go into this land tell these people they have to move out because our books show  so that's as crazy as joseph smith and the mormons incorrect incorrect we went into the land and we  lived peacefully side by side with the arabs uh all the way up i don't remember peaceful when was that  you need to you need to read your history books we we lived and we lived side by side the arabs had no 
[01:16:30]  problem with us they had no problem with us and then once the conflict started once the conflict  started the arabs took up arms against us we gave them an opportunity they decided to leave the  country and no other country surrounding israel would accept them into their country and so the  arabs became the ones the palestinians became the one who had no state because their fellow muslims  would not even accept them into any of their states the jordanians got a little bit but mostly nobody 
[01:17:00]  would accept them and so they had nowhere to go and so then they decided to take up arms against israel  who was totally fine with the way that the united nations partitioned the land and we were fine  with everything and it was the arabs who were the ones that that took up arms and started making a  problem with everything i've got one statement besides the fact that you're wrong one statement to end it  that's how that's how it should sound in the united nations right after a big fucking argument 
[01:17:30]  what's nice about the whole argument is that even though we have differences of opinion we can all  agree to iraq is that yes that's the key to world peace that is true i do i do think if you take this  biblical stuff out of it because a lot of these guys are arguing um religion and and and the torah  and other kind of uh religious um writings and just take it for what happened um and i think what was 
[01:18:00]  it was the 1948 um u.n decision uh it was based on a post-war um middle east and europe a lot of borders  changed post-war um that was just another one that that changed uh because of world events and israel uh  the jews and the palestinians seemed like they were in the area with these very gray tribal borders and 
[01:18:30]  until something was hammered out um it just continued that way after 48 the israelis who i  believe you know you say judaism is a religion which it is but being an israeli is a a nationalist  you know you you you that's your country israel you're an israeli israelis are made up of many  yeah sorry sorry that's okay uh well no but there were there were many um there were many uh completely 
[01:19:00]  secular zionist organizations that sprung up in in poland and other countries in europe well before  the holocaust that were advocating moving to moving to is uh to at the time what was called  palestine yeah and all these people there were very many of them i mean theodore hurtville who who  is considered the father of modern day zionism was not himself a religious jew he was not a practice  he may have you know he may have been somewhat practicing but he's not what what people would 
[01:19:30]  consider uh religious too but uh people followed in his footsteps it was not an issue of religion at  the beginning you know i mean first of all there are plenty of people who it is including myself  who it is an issue of religion but even if we take religion out of it right there is still there's  still a a secular movement of zionism and most of the people who came in in the 20s and earlier to  just build up the land irrigation different agricultural uh advances that nobody had thought 
[01:20:00]  about in israel they made things grow in the desert where there was nothing and the arabs were just  selling oranges it's a very productive uh country and a very strong uh ally for the united states to  have in the middle east definitely um thank you my jewish friend yeah yeah have a have a great day  all right could you check uh my mail in the mailbox make sure um it's uh see i'm implying he's my  neighbor no he's not a different guy okay all right kiva i would never live on island oh well hoity  toity fancy boy jew i spent i spent three years living in new york city and it was just uh it was 
[01:20:30]  it was terrible it was horrible you know there's a lot of good jewish people there but uh they're they're  not uh not so many of uh of the non you know i say there's a lot of uh shysters a lot of shysters  well no shysters are jewish lawyers that's uh exactly oh we know that's what i say oh i've got  yeah my brother who's listening right now and i don't understand that they weren't jewy enough 
[01:21:00]  for you is that what you're getting at not jewy enough no no no no no it was very jewy i lived in  i lived in washington heights for three years it was the problem was the uh was the dominican uh uh  pop population oh you know not from a religious point of view at all just from what the neighbor  just from a i want to keep my wallet point from a try to kick your ass and yeah and take your  shit it's not a hate crime it's the music it's the music and the uh pissing on the street and making 
[01:21:30]  barbecues of ridiculous types of meat that i've never heard of yeah so you're a lot of horrible so  you're headed back to ohio all right it came out great all right have a great day see you uh we got  another palestinian on the line here joe in brooklyn joe hey boys hi joe hey man i'm gonna i'm  gonna put you on with uh ben from israel all right sounds good all right joe's in brooklyn he's pro  palestine uh ben in israel hey ben hey anthony great talking to you guys boy and uh you're listening to 
[01:22:00]  us in israel right now in jerusalem we just had a rocket attack like 10 minutes ago we had to run to  the shelters oh man that's funny how are people listening to us in israel that's fucked up yeah  internet the app is amazing in between the bombs the future the future that's right all right joe  from brooklyn ben in israel he gets bombs from both ends let's let's go with uh joe in brooklyn pro  palestine what's up joe what's your thought well one i'm i'm a former marine well i'm still in the 
[01:22:30]  reserves and all that so i've been overseas i've seen some of that and i'm not by any means pro  terrorists and palestine definitely has a lot of that but these uh these people especially like  the jewish people that cite the bible or sorry the torah which is just a magical book you know there's  they say this for for like land issues but there's people that have you know lived for 500 a thousand  years in the book so it's stupid you can't use a dumb religious book in my opinion i know they hold 
[01:23:00]  that deer but let's be honest it's almost agree 100 percent but here's the thing that bothers me  about israel i agree with their right to defend themselves but just the ratio at the killings  happen you know israel generally does like a precision strike to attack a terrorist that isn't  that isn't very publicized because that's like what we do too we don't go to cnn and say hey we just  bomb someone right then the retaliation comes which is then publicized because they they they do it 
[01:23:30]  indiscriminately and then israel will go back and shoot you know like the the death toll is always  very skewed in israel's favor like right now it's something like ten to one yeah but what that's  because the weapons that israel have are much better weapons they're much more organized and uh the fact  is that um hamas loves putting these fucking weapons systems in in populated areas to try to  protect themselves uh and it doesn't work all the time absolutely also joe joe's missing a point 
[01:24:00]  before before we killed off the head of the hamas army in the week before that we had a hundred rockets  shot at civilian homes yeah in israel dozens of rockets a day children living in bombshells no country  can live with that and it wasn't that firstly killed him that he waited for retaliation that  retaliated back it is inconsistent military targets and unfortunately god is really densely populated  and they did they put rockets underneath hospitals or schools within a hundred yards of where they 
[01:24:30]  keep different rockets it is impossible to unfortunately and i feel so bad for the god of  people every time an innocent god in person dies i feel bad i don't want to see innocent dead  Palestinians it's not my goal but there's nothing to do the only thing that they  have to do to end this to stop the suffering of people in gaza to stop shooting rockets if you  stop shooting rockets from gaza towards israel will immediately stop bombing gaza that's all  they have to do but if we just were one day to stop our air force attacks in order to stop hitting 
[01:25:00]  those precision targets we'd still have the rockets yeah yeah i hear you i do have to agree with you  there ben i'm just i wish there was a better solution because every time this happens say imagine  your family dies in a rocket strike or uh you know you're palestinian and your family dies in a  rocket strike are you ever going to forgive israel no so that's another however many years of your  generation of your family is going to be anti-israel and it works the same way works the same way when  a bus in tel aviv explodes yeah i'll tell you the difference majority of israelis want a a peaceful 
[01:25:30]  two-state solution israelis live over here palestinians live over there and we don't only deal with each  other a little bit that's what majority of israelis want that's what our prime minister neige always  said officially and that's what a lot of people that don't stand for an issue is that in gaza when  you're shooting rockets at civilians it's not what you stand for and and it stinks that so many  innocent people have to die we're going to respond and we're going to respond it the best way we 
[01:26:00]  could and hit as many military targets yeah i have to say it does make for good footage but isn't there  a better way than these precision airstrikes that do end up killing uh all these innocent civilians  isn't there a better way they can why would they why would they compromise during a war because they're  being shot at with these missiles why did they have to come up with a better way to take these missiles  out uh when they're being put in civilian areas it's not up to israel to uh bring the death toll 
[01:26:30]  down when they're not the aggressors in this instance there's also there's hamash's goal is  to destroy israel and i love hummus i didn't like it lives are not important to them in that goal  like they don't mind sacrificing dozens hundreds of own civilian lives if it means they're getting that  goal so there's no way to negotiate with hamash you can't you know you can't sit hamash down and  say okay we'll do this we'll do that you know maybe now we'll have a ceasefire negotiations but 
[01:27:00]  what they want like right now if you're saying what they want is ridiculous they want open access to the  sea they want open access to the sea so that iran can send them better missiles better right and better  way to kill families in israel yeah their ceasefire terms are a little silly yeah a little over uh  uh overbearing a little a little overstretched they want yeah they want to see why would you give them  an easier way to get missiles from iran it's crazy maybe they just want to export hummus 
[01:27:30]  hold on a minute hold on a minute genuine hamas hummus i've been waiting for this we got we got a guy  that wants to interrupt this uh joe in brooklyn joe hey you ben let me tell you one thing don't take  the fucking cnn pictures what they're doing and taking pictures from syria which they don't kill  down the fucking 50 000 people nobody says a word when they take pictures out of the old news you know  a bbc reporter yesterday apologized yeah true picture out of the syria thing why are you  fucking blaming the israelis they're taking syrian pictures of children that are dead and stuff and 
[01:28:00]  attributing it to um no kidding to israel killing uh people in gaza yeah yeah that's what i'm saying  the israelis they all they're doing is they're getting rid of these targets and what they do is  they take a human shield and all they're doing is trying to protect their fucking terrorists with  little babies yeah in the fucking world where they should die and guess what all these fucking babies  they're gonna end up being terrorists in five years now believe me yeah they have videos with small  children in bomb belts i'm not saying i'm on amazon side at all the people of palestine itself you 
[01:28:30]  know 90 99 95 of them are not doing this that's what i'm saying it's like when i was in iraq and  afghanistan let me tell you one thing another fourth israeli just died just died like he was injured  this morning i get the text messages all the time he just fucking died that's depressing texts  jesus absolutely that they tweeted everything that's nonsense they're fucking hired they're  firing rockets five years non-stop and innocent people they don't know what a war is and then you 
[01:29:00]  fucking want to tell me that what the heck is going on over here but they're starting to blow  themselves all these fucking muslims yeah but here's the thing i'm assuming it's roughly the same thing  when i was in iraq and afghanistan most of the people there are not happy with this being there but  they don't want to kill us by any means by the time we left iraq in 2007 in the middle of the  surge we're in one of the worst areas the haditha triad anthony i know you've heard of that yeah all  the marines executed the people the by our last months there there was two ieds that were set up 
[01:29:30]  in the same area one the police told the iraqi police that we worked with about it and the second  time the citizens came out and beat the people because they didn't want any more ieds in their in  in their uh uh yeah in their streets so i'm just saying like i'm i'm not 100 pro-palestine and i'm  definitely not pro-hamas but i'm just saying i think israel being the bigger nation being the  nation that is supposed to have higher higher morality needs to realize that you know there 
[01:30:00]  should be a better solution so they should just sit there and take missiles being lobbed into their  country it doesn't make sense there's no simple solution and with that said this guy wants it badly  daniel in new jersey you're on with joe in brooklyn who's uh pro-palestine hey joe um you know like  i just said you know yeah people say that israel's response is uh disproportionate but you know you're  the former military guy you know you said before there were better solutions you would know better  than me if you don't have a solution how would you expect you know uh someone else on the air to um 
[01:30:30]  you know the choices are israel can just sit back and let them launch the rockets or they can fire  back with the weapons that they have i'd see i had i'd be happier with israel doing  uh manned missions in palestine and actually breaking you know the you know how we went into  uh pakistan i'd rather that happen i'd rather a kinetic surgical thing where there's not so  many innocent civilians always dying i know that's the more dangerous thing you're breaking palestine's 
[01:31:00]  actual nationality but i just don't think that sending missiles is really in essence is doing  the same thing that palestine is doing it's different when you're defending defending themselves  again yeah it's different when you're defending than when you're the initial aggressor  you know they're they're trying to take out the missiles that that hamas is shooting into their  country so yeah iron dome i love because that's a solution where they don't have to  fucking send other missiles back i know that's what we call uh radio wizard here iron dome 
[01:31:30]  all right well all right i think we made a point here that um there's no solution we're all doomed  hey anthony yeah let's go out to galverson all right shalom my friend  all right joe joe's gone everyone's gone there you go uh well we settled a lot right there didn't  we we sure did absolutely nothing yeah i don't think we did yeah i know it is a kind of religious 
[01:32:00]  thing which is fucked up i don't like any type of religion dictating who's blowing each other up  it does come off as really stupid from both of them it's a religious thing yes exactly the  muslims and the uh and the jews it's a mutual hatred they all they all feel entitled to this holy  land thing and that's why there'll never be a long-term uh solution yeah but let me let  we'll never be one let me ask you something else here and this has been uh uh bellied about um 
[01:32:30]  israel is a small little nation surrounded by people that hate them and want them wiped off the face of  the earth uh it's made them a very resilient uh rugged people how come in all the middle east  there's that one little fucking nation that's israel very tiny leave us alone yet all these arab  countries have so much fucking land why don't you give the palestinians a homeland that they could 
[01:33:00]  fucking enjoy call their own build whatever they want to build out of it um give them access to uh  uh uh to pray at jerusalem at some point you know if they need uh access to their holy land  uh but give them a nation that they could call their own and build and be a productive member  of uh the world community but all these arab nations don't want to give them a fucking  an inch of of land stubborn yeah it's ridiculous so they got to look at israel as speck in the middle 
[01:33:30]  east and say we want that that yeah that's what they want please come on well their argument would  be and i'm guessing it would be well this is but it's ours exactly like yeah maybe we're going to  get past this point that's like say why don't we get to be made that's like say why don't we give up  maine hand it to canada i'm not saying i mean that's just oh we could easily do that i'd love to  actually i'm trying to i think it's tired of maine lobster killers it just seems to me like there's a better  solution if you take the religion out of it yeah they feel it's their homeland because of you know 
[01:34:00]  religious um people aren't going to budge on their religion ever no that's the problem no they won't  open it all said and done they all realize like wow that was a wash you just threw a lot of  to shit you just threw a lot of logic at the problem but that's the logic is uh there's no  place for it there in the middle east all right how about a little uh heavy metal gangnam style  oh we can just play this to break right we don't have to comment on it i don't know gangnam  style might want to say uh rock might want to say hey what it rocks yeah you can pop up the mic 
[01:34:30]  xm xm this is the op anthony show  got another guy in israel i know we're trying to move on but he wants to  tell us what it's like to live in a bomb shelter oh you want to do this yeah quickly 
[01:35:00]  let the gassers smell a lot of people listen to us in uh israel uh david what's up buddy  david  david david my son david is this the david we know  is he is he in the bomb shelter but he left his phone upstairs he's talking through 
[01:35:30]  fucking cement walls how frustrating is this david oh you can hear oh i think i hear bombs going off  force is bad cell phone it's either bombs or bad cell phone right there's a there's a storm in israel  yeah yeah it must be that hurricane climate weather  oh oh well that's not promising oh right off one david oh was that a bad cell phone or was he 
[01:36:00]  under attack as he's trying to talk to us we gotta hope that was a bad cell phone that's our friend  david from israel from time to time well maybe not all right well uh the today show just uh  reference something we did to them many years ago okay yeah this is about us but they didn't  mention our names uh remember the time we had the girl uh wow do the wow on live tv she had great  ones didn't she she had nice tits right she did all right man did she i thought she had good ones 
[01:36:30]  yeah she did all right the video was online uh the video is online somewhere maybe we could put it  on our facebook page we haven't talked about this in a while but many years ago uh we had a girl go  it on the today show when they did the live audience shot and we got her to flash her tt uh-huh  on live tv it was a big story for us it was a big get so for some reason out of nowhere they uh  referenced that today wonder why do you remember we had a little incident with nudity public nudity  here on the today show back in 2006 here's what happened really hot muggy it's getting dark now 
[01:37:00]  which sounds it could rain any moment but as you can see we've still got a nice crowd of people  gathered right outside our studio a very large crowd actually and we're not spitzing too much down  there katie okay yeah i'm here with uh anne curry and katie of course as you can see is down in  philadelphia at the first union center that is the site of the  company where you can see it no can we play it again i missed it i couldn't i missed it vanna  missed it no because we yeah here we go real quickly watch watch the pan 
[01:37:30]  i totally missed it our producer got missed  what year was that they said 96 uh 2006 but it wasn't 2006. i don't think it was either no that was  the old new yeah yeah they fucked up the date i think yeah they did and there she is  there you go that was us yeah that was the clip they definitely showed so i don't think that was 
[01:38:00]  2006. it was no it was like the old the old katie's all fucked up why don't we have the audio  this because it was pretty funny oh sorry and then you got matt lauer who uh went on jay leno and  called us idiots and stuff and uh we got that clip we're in good company yeah i don't hear any audio  today yeah whatever no no it's not working katie freaked out she's like did you see that  she was like oh my god because they went she was on remote and they're like those are nice tits 
[01:38:30]  there you go perfect timing too man look at katie i wish you could hear the audio  it was when matt lauer had hair so it certainly wasn't 2006. no that was very early on now it had  to be like uh i'm gonna go 2000 2001. i'm gonna say 1965. oh wait uh convention so we can do that so it had  to be we're up to 2012 or 2008 2004 so 2000 i'm gonna go i'm gonna go 2000. whatever 
[01:39:00]  oh we don't have the audio what's that huh i guess it was a page in a book oh gives a shite because a  shite is right we oh yeah here and then matt lauer went on jay leno and he said this how about the  woman that took her shirt off in the in the line which i hear you've had a little we had a lot of  fun with it did that shock you well you know what it was we were outside if you've seen the 8 30 in 
[01:39:30]  the show every morning the camera pans the crowd outside and and what i do is since i can't see  where the camera is sometimes i look at the monitor and i'm standing there it happened to be with ann  curry katie was in philadelphia the time i'm looking at the monitor i see the people go by and normally  you know hi mom hey kansas go jayhawks and all of a sudden the camera goes by and this woman looks at  the camera and goes and my first thought was it was one of those kind of like plastic pieces that you  wear on halloween you know that they weren't real they might have been yeah when you think about it and  and then after like forty five seconds of staring at it i said you know those are real and you know 
[01:40:00]  she had written the word wow on her stomach which apparently is you know w w stands for this stupid  radio station promotion new york called whip them out wednesdays and so she whipped them out  well it's not a stupid promotion anymore they just got a lot of publicity i think it actually said powwow  but gravity had covered the uh... really the top word oh you shouldn't have to laugh for that  but what's weird about it is think about this lady at some point during her day that day she had to  get in front of a mirror and say yeah these are ready for national television and i gotta be honest 
[01:40:30]  you speak as one boob man to another these were not that great i mean i've seen a lot better boobs  than these and you work with them on a morning show but you know what's good in in what six years  of having the outdoor studio i think that's the first there was one other little weird thing but  that's the first time anyone has you know gone say that now but you know we have most of the  people are great they're very wholesome people he's just a jerk you jerk a stupid radio promotion you 
[01:41:00]  know exactly what the stupid radio promotion so i think it's a pretty good fucking radio promotion  matt lauer you motherfucker dope so they referenced that today again on their show what what jimmy what  is this thing on facebook i got um this woman who everybody's so mad at for uh posting a disrespectful  picture where she's yelling at the uh do you know what i'm talking about it was on twitter  no idea it links to facebook um they said she posted some picture which i can't blow it up

[01:44:00]  like she's yelling and she's flicking off the sign but she's being a total cunt and being  and disrespectful and that's why everyone's trying to call her oh she was trying to have her little  moment yeah that's that's basically just a joke that misfired whoops yeah i mean that's all that  is it's like we've had a few of those yeah yeah she might be a douchebag but it's like yeah i don't  care is it that big a deal no who cares i mean is it disrespectful yeah but i get it when when

[01:50:30]  out be honest it happened twice i've been trying to get my little facebook back forever when's the last  time you gave it out months ago no you don't deserve it why would they give it back to you all right  i think it's gotten to the point it's gotten to the point that i kind of annoyed that mark zuckerberg  that i i would purposely tell him to give me my own password back you're trying to talk to mark zuckerberg 
[01:51:00]  about how stupid you are yeah you don't deserve it why why should he you gave it out what kind of  dummy gives out that fucking password jimmy you think mark zuckerberg has more important things  to do than doing bobo everybody does the stock's in the toilet but wait let me uh let me uh make sure  bobos taking care of i also i also got got embodied about my twitter people thinking that i'm a fake 
[01:51:30]  some people think who could possibly think that oh no so so what what are you so what are you gonna  do bobo yeah you're on the show yeah you're on the show complaining  fucking annoying what are you doing it's not much all right but you can't just call the show to

[01:59:00]  fucking day yeah  draining jimmy is that the word right oh fuck man yeah it really is so uh we're gonna figure out  this uh twinkies thing well i do believe they're gonna try to kind of working it out they could try  some uh what mediation yeah yeah i think they gotta slam these guys in uh rooms and a lot of people 
[01:59:30]  are uh jay wars wow he's looking all cleaned up on imus ah holy fuck how's he doing um promoting  yeah promoting jay bullets uh yeah i guess they're gonna try to figure this twinkie goddamn thing out  everyone's having a lot of fun with the twinkie thing but the fact uh remains a lot of people are  going to lose their jobs if this goes through so uh the judge is giving them a day or two to  try to figure out a solution before they move forward with the bankruptcy yeah get in a room 
[02:00:00]  and start fucking uh who do you blame on this one management or uh union i don't understand how a  union can fucking negotiate themselves all out of fucking work it seems counterproductive to me  were the teamsters being unreasonable i don't know but i've heard they had a different union for  everything like to back the truck in to take the stuff off the dock to bring it in like it was one  of those situations absolutely it was the baker's union which is like 30 percent of the work and so  no no but what the union's being with the union's being i don't know but i do know that the larger 
[02:00:30]  union that they're blaming management that that's like the majority of of the workers there are not  happy at this baker's union because they they had a deal and then this separate smaller union i was  like no we don't want i make twinkies for your father how do you fuck up twinkies i don't know  how do you go how do you go bankrupt if your product is twinkies act act like you got ho-hos  get rid of those uh yeah apparently um i play management yeah yes gutfeld who's coming in uh 
[02:01:00]  at nine yes promoting his book the joy of hate yes um he was on the five yesterday which is a fox show  and uh i guess they have what uh bob uh beckle yeah i like bob beckle um what is it bob backland  yes he was doing the leg walk yeah bob backland yeah well uh they were talking about the uh twinkies  and greg put four twinkies in a blender with milk and just made a shake out of it nice and bob just 
[02:01:30]  fucking chugged it down wow and he couldn't finish the show i i don't know what happened but he left  they were like well but yeah bob had to leave i think he either fell into a diabetic coma or or  puked his guts up is he okay i don't know that's the last i heard oh so i want to ask greg about  this um but he greg said it tasted great of course it does but you can't drink four twinkies and milk  at one shot why not let's give it a shot oh man let's do this i've heard of another one that you can't 
[02:02:00]  do what should we stick with the twinkie thing though what's the other one oh is it the uh what's the one  bananas and sprite what wow who the fuck tried that how many bananas i think it's i think it's two  bananas up your ass though right and like a liter of sprite and what you just leader cola it's probably  a liter of sprite you can't drink with anything yeah no it's not it's like some reaction you make  a shake out of it or no you just you just eat some bananas and try to chug down some sprite  what's the other one bread or something i don't know but i think we need to do what's the bread one 
[02:02:30]  um you can't eat two of their albums  what's the one with the bread i think there's a bread one right is there uh crackers like you  can't like crackers crackers crackers in your mouth who the fuck you call them saltines you  mars is the fucking man saltines are sweet teens  holy shit really see either one thank you mars baby powder spray  i got my baby pride oh uncle paul likes that oh god it's like an aphrodisiac 
[02:03:00]  oh god smells like people been fucking why can i have it jimmy just  fucking no i didn't i'll give you no i did not it was a while ago i did not i'll give you the clean  and fresh fresh they're very thick today oh spray it all over god smells like fucking in here  jesus you got some pre-linking right there i was like 
[02:03:30]  why don't we know about the twinkies thing who's at fault here  i heard management's taking way too big of a piece of the pie well i heard at one point they  were taking they gave themselves these giant giant raises but by then then someone said no by then  they were there this the ship was already sinking ah all right so i don't know all right  it just seems to me like sometimes the uh unions get a little rambunctious yeah and uh  then they're unemployed going what happened but management just happened management proves 
[02:04:00]  themselves to be despicable too like you know you look at a lot of company people that should be  getting raises don't get them and then manage gives themselves big stock options you know i  mean it's like they give themselves piggy boy fucking uh raises yeah they do it's like both sides  are gross but management has never made it easier they've never made it easy on themselves  holy fuck the amount of money they're taking unbelievable disgusting they don't even have to  show up anymore management i'm saying half these guys don't show up half of them  jesus christ all right well that's all we have on the twinkies thing yeah i want to know more about 
[02:04:30]  it mediation and um they're trying to figure out their differences i care about what are we doing  about these twinkie shakes i want to try a twinkie shake twinkie shake fuck yeah they don't even sell  them you can't get twinkies anymore they're all off the shelves that's true you're probably not  gonna be able to even find what are you gonna do right and buy twinkies that ain't gonna happen  it's like gasoline rationing yeah fuck i bet you someone could get us some twinkies i didn't even  wait i bet i can go down to dwayne reed and get twinkies you think yeah i would bet a lot of money  you can oh god but you can go i think i can get twinkies i'll bet you a whole ten dollars 
[02:05:00]  i would love a twinkie but after i ate it i'll be like why lay a twinkie oh yeah you wouldn't you  wouldn't be happy with yourself i can go i can go get some bananas and sprite if you want  it sounds awful though a twinkie shake sounds delicious the gas that would give me like a half  a glass of twinkie shake and i would my hot farts would be legendary problem is uh piggy boy isn't  here to actually do the stunt but maybe sal could throw up or something sal what is it doing for us 
[02:05:30]  it wouldn't work out because i mean i love sal he's great i like sal he's a good boy he's a good  boy it's just a bit of a boob eats uh c robins he can't be that bad although someone uh wrote that  it's good for soup can you imagine having a little wings sticking out oh my god who would do that that  that's what i do every morning i'll see robin not anymore sal and try will both are both offering  to the twinkie of the building oh the banana five banana and sprite challenge what 
[02:06:00]  troy and sal are willing to uh compete in them well what's the official challenge  all right did you look it up banana sprite challenge you take these bananas  is that beverly hills god jesus christ you take these bananas  i won't tell nobody i won't tell nobody you take these bananas yeah you take the bananas and flip on  the peels or something yeah it's basically two bananas eat two bananas and drink as much sprite as you 
[02:06:30]  as you feel comfortable with and then what happens your stomach there's a reaction i think between  some of the acids or something in the sprite and the banana and something isn't supposed to mix well  together and you supposedly can't keep it down that's always a good oh you can't keep it down  do you have one banana and a glass of sprite i think you might need more than that but you could  try it i think from watching some of these videos i think uh you know the the tolerance was very  dependent on the person some people didn't need much sprite and other people's needed a lot of  sprite but uh and some people weren't affected at all my nickname is sprite no it's not this hi 
[02:07:00]  sprite hi guys now i'm pretty sure that this will work with sierra mist also sprites here guys hi  everybody sprite hey is this uh i guess this is uh i'm a sprite channel video let's take a look at this  i've never heard of this what is it what is this video right now well it's a video of nothing because  there's a fucking one play there it is but what are we immediately drink two all right hold on  all right we're already about to throw up we just had a waffle house so we're already sick

[02:11:00]  let's do this greg gutfeld in studio new book the joy of hate how to triumph over whiners in the  age of phony outrage yeah it's been a while man it's been like at least a year or so i think the  last time i was here somebody urinated next to me nice oh god damn yes i don't remember two times in 
[02:11:30]  a row because i feel one coming yeah you were testing you were testing the stainage on one of  your interns because he had got he had gotten drunk and denied that he had wet himself so you had him  recreate it next to me test it and at nine in the morning with a hangover it was the worst  possible thing you could do i almost threw up that was bad we do this on a daily basis and we  just forget about it but to the guest it's like a memory they'll never it scarred me yeah i mean  because you know what it was the thing is when you walk into a bathroom you kind of you you uh 
[02:12:00]  become acclimatized to the smell of the bathroom when you go in there but when you're in a small  room like this that smell yeah normal bathroom smells make you almost vomit but then in the bathroom  you're just like meh yeah exactly exactly dang who was this i don't remember this at all it was  intern evan swivel hips so danny are you farting in this motherfucker no no uh-uh jimmy no no not me  it's terrible so give me a break for like one fucking hour i tried i want to play poker with 
[02:12:30]  jimmy norton it's my fault for bringing up uh the oh god damn it's terrible baby powder spray  that's the most invention ever wow that's pretty cool is that what they give to lap dancers  yes they always smell like that and sweat yes it's desperation yeah it's a lot of  desperation smell they smell like forgotten dads yes i gotta i gotta uh ask you something about uh 
[02:13:00]  yesterday the five um i saw bob uh yeah drink your twinkie concoction it was four twinkies yes and milk  in a blender yes and uh you poured it out you took a little sip everyone around the room took a  little sip and went wow that is really tasty yeah and then he had to take it with bob always has to  outdo everybody of course and that was just because i i heard like you know they were going to liquidate  uh liquidate uh hostess so i thought oh liquidate that's how i hear yeah that's why you get the big  bucks exactly that's him in the high five figures yeah and so yeah of course it's bob so bob has to do 
[02:13:30]  outdo everybody and he downed the whole thing which was short for twinkies yeah yeah and um  and then it was that thing everybody knows that feeling when hey that was awesome everything's  great and we're gonna we're about to do something and then you get that kind of like cold panic sweat  that that something's happening like an anxiety attack yeah and you saw it on his face and he just  kind of like he just i mean i thought maybe he was gonna throw up right there right there but then  he like took out he's never done that before he took off the mic he took off everything he walked 
[02:14:00]  off yeah he walked off has anyone heard from him yeah he's fine apparently he's oh i was wondering  if you put him in like a diabetic coma or he vomited wouldn't it be great though but but by some weird  discovery it cures something like like all of a sudden he's like right he's got like a full head of  blonde hair and like i think so tweaky shakes actually have some kind of he's conservative  yeah he's changing political views the twinkie the twinkie shake yeah just it flips you completely 
[02:14:30]  no matter where you are exactly what a mess that whole situation is they're trying to save 18 000  jobs we didn't mention that uh before the break yeah yeah that's a biggie it's like the judge is  basically saying look we can't afford that uh 18 000 people out of work so let's try to figure this  shit out guys yeah so you give them a couple days huh yeah when you look at uh it depends on you to  talk to you talk to management it's all unions fault and then the vice versa but uh from what  i've seen in the past a lot of times these unions will negotiate their way right out of a job yeah  it's astounding they know the end result they can see the end yeah and they still they still walk 
[02:15:00]  right at it they go well anything we do is going to kill jobs but because of our principles and our you  know i don't know just the way we think about you know our role it's not about the worker it's about  the union used to be about the worker now it's just about yeah preserving the union they walk right out  that door the one thing that amazed me about the whole thing is i didn't know like it's a baker's  union right who knew that you baked a twinkie yeah like pulled it out of the ground it's like it 
[02:15:30]  really is like uh just chemicals it's a chemical but it's a beautiful chemical that's what i figure  like more of a chemical plant worker i would assume it's something that's just extruding these horrid  it's like when you see those those stock photos of people who work at like apple when they're in  in these yeah clean environments in the clean room with a mask there's this one twinkie there  and they have to like move around it baker contaminated i don't picture the guy with  the big white hat on you know baking there's dough and flour around no it's twinkies they

[02:21:30]  a cookie yeah that's the uh that's the 1970s they created the uh idea that that somehow the your  thought your parents sweets or your parents desserts were not correct not good so we'll  try to bamboozle you you can't even get a churbel anymore i used to love a good churbel what was in  a churbel yeah what was in a churbel a churbel was a circular and it was a coconut flaking with tuna  fish inside it was wet tuna fish and dry flaky coconut and what you do is you'd have you put a 
[02:22:00]  churbel in his cheek and allow them to dissolve in your mouth do you know what we're similar in  age do you remember when that that it was a very early promotion of sardine pez where it was just  the pez dispenser with a sardine jammed into it and you just opened up and you bit the head off  see it didn't work for me no are you serious that was a joke oh i thought you were saying  i was sitting there like wait a minute i'll tell you why you didn't get i i your acting's too good  because you said when we were you remember when we were young i was like all right maybe this is a 
[02:22:30]  legit yeah yeah concept yeah you everybody laughed if you'd said it but i ruined it by  trying to do a preface a story yeah you had to let people know it was ludicrous like how about uh  this one is as a ridiculous yeah yeah i've had different pez flavors before but never anything  of sardine we all just left you hanging on that like a bunch of creeps like oh greg that was legit  nice try greg uh i want to i want to read this book there sir yeah let's delve into the joy of hate  uh i absolutely just got the title immediately i understand it if anybody yeah you should if 
[02:23:00]  anybody reads my tweets and uh here's this radio show they understand i know what the joy of hate  is yeah yeah like you've said you and you've described it in this book it's exhausting yeah it's  uh it's a chore yeah but there's such a joy that comes from utter hatred and and just despising people's  phony outrage exactly and then the funny it is the people that like that claim to be the most 
[02:23:30]  tolerant yeah that are by far the most intolerant people you will ever meet and and uh it's like  it's like somebody who says that they're your biggest fan when they go to a comedy show until  they say until you there might be one joke that upsets them because they might have chronic fatigue  syndrome right you made for they've been following you for eight years and then one you say a joke  about chronic fatigue and then they're i can't listen to you anymore right you are not funny you  know that you cross the line funny that isn't very funny it's like well wait a second so you were 
[02:24:00]  laughing at all the fat jokes right yeah until it hits too close to home right you're fine with it  yeah and then but the thing is people create these false uh uh uh ideas of offense like that's too close  so i'm gonna go but no wait you're you're not even part of that group you're just doing this because  you see a scalp of contrition you can go and you you can see an opening where you can you can use your  emotion to hurt somebody that's what hates modern hate is about gotcha it's about uh they don't really 
[02:24:30]  even care because then they forget about it after they get you after they force you to apologize then  they move on and then they're like they don't even remember it it's attention yeah it's attention  seeking that they use the words of a performer they're like weird like like weird parasite  special interest groups where they they they will as soon as a performer they gotta gotcha yeah they  jump onto your back and they make you parrot their message right so their outrage is very insincere  they just see it as an opportunity to get some attention to get a celebrity endorsement right you  know what uh the guy uh but what hold on before you move on why do we deal with that 
[02:25:00]  shit as a society why because we i think we should know better i think we've i think we have become  paralyzed by the idea of being perceived as mean doesn't we are in a sensitive this country is so  sensitive right now that even compliments if you tell tell people you know what you should get you get  up early go to work which is a compliment because you're assuming that they can do it that's considered  mean like just basic common sense is now uh unacceptable uh or even bigoted like i told 
[02:25:30]  the woman one time like the workplace you can't like there was a there's a girl who started working  here so i said to her like wow the way that dress hugs you uh if we were in an elevator i'd probably  take it out and tug it and i didn't even use any profanity but all of a sudden she has a problem  that's that's not what i really talk about in the book right right that's not page 58  that's not in the book uh no by the way the greg is doing a bunch of signings too and this 
[02:26:00]  it's g gut fell g-u-t-f-e-l-d dot com if you want to get it gg guys oh i'm sorry but it's g  it's the first g so it would be g gut felt you know a g z usually got dot com is the other i  randomly opened your book to the chapter that's entitled poop stars yeah that was about i think that's  it's about Occupy Wall Street and how the press like the press hated the Tea Party because it  reminded them of their parents, even though they didn't do anything wrong. They didn't break  anything. I always say they never throw chairs through windows because they own both of them.  Whereas the Occupy Wall Street, you know, they were young, romantic. The media saw themselves 
[02:26:30]  in Occupy Wall Street. So they cut them so much slack to a point where these guys are pooping  on cop cars. There's sexual assaults. There's drugs everywhere. But instead of the media  focusing on that, they walked away from it. They stepped back and they said nothing to see here.  Even President Obama was like, you know, he gets the sentiment until they saw that it was more than  sentiment. That was being all over the floor. You're not wrong at all because I went down to  Occupy Wall Street a lot and most of the people very close to the movement down there didn't take 
[02:27:00]  them seriously at all. They pretty much openly would mock and laugh at them. But then how the media  portrayed it was completely different. You know what it is? To me, the reason why Occupy Wall Street  was so successful or appealing is because there's no good open air concerts anymore.  It's like if we just had more Lollapaloozas and more Day on the Greens, we'd have all these  people at concerts and we wouldn't have to have them. You're outside, you're partying, you're  hooking up. Instead, they have to go to Zuccotti Park and crap everywhere. I had fun going down 
[02:27:30]  there every day. There were cute girls. It was amazing. The drums, the drumming alone was great  every day. But you know what's funny? The press made it seem so big. And when you look at it,  it wasn't big. And then the poor, I love that the tourists would come down because they'd hear  about it. It'd be like seeing the naked cowboy, except it's the half naked heroin addict. And  they would take pictures and then all of a sudden it would get uncomfortable because there'd be  people that had become part of the group that were either ex-cons or just homeless people. 
[02:28:00]  And then you don't want your, if you're a tourist from Germany, you don't want like four guys with  no pants surrounding your kids. And what I noticed is the weather got colder. You got  much more scarier people hanging out down there. When it was warm, it was all fun,  bunch of hippies, smoking pot, drum circles. But when that weather started hitting, you did see  the convicts and the people that started getting their free food and clothing and that's the  other reason they were there. I love the celebrities that would go down there and like one day for an  hour, here's some food, here's some food. And then they kind of go, we got to get out of here. 
[02:28:30]  It all disappear. And I think Jay-Z was one of the first people down there. And then,  but at least he had the guts to say, this is BS. And he was like, you know what? I'm a capitalist  and these guys don't like capitalism. I'm paraphrasing it. But he was like, he would,  I guess he was there with Russell Simmons who bought into it completely. By the way,  Russell Simmons should look and see that this is, these are white liberal intelligentsia.  These are not revolutionaries. These are people that are either were paid, their student loans were 
[02:29:00]  paid for by daddy, mommy, or paid for by us. You raised a brilliant point one time about the  Tea Party and how the press went after them and mocked them for their being racist and terrible  when the reality is they were protesting against higher taxes. Like they were protesting for  something that most people can kind of relate to. And yet these other ridiculous movements,  whether it was the way Code Pink goes about business or somebody else, they don't attack the  way they ridiculed the Tea Party. Yeah, no, absolutely not. And, and the Tea Party  actually was okay. If you look at celebrities, they like to see themselves as a very edgy and 
[02:29:30]  speaking truth to power that, uh, uh, the Tea Party actually was speaking truth to power.  Occupy Wall Street was like French kissing power. They wanted, you know, they wanted bigger government.  So the people like Jon Stewart, uh, may, you know, making light of the Tea Party. Uh,  so he was actually mocking people who speak truth to power, which to me is like, that that's  completely not what you're supposed to do. You're supposed to align yourself with, you know,  these people never protested. They didn't know what the Tea Party people didn't even know what 
[02:30:00]  they were doing. No, no. The worst thing that happened was like grass stains or they got in  an argument over potato salad. People were always trying to accuse them of being racist and yelling  out things when, when they were gathering somewhere. Or MSNBC doctrine, you know, like editing so that  they didn't show that a guy who was wearing a gun was black. They just showed like his waist.  The gun. Yeah. Another thing, another thing with the Tea Party is their whole platform,  not the whole platform, but the hugest part of their platform is they want to elect Tea Party 
[02:30:30]  candidates that are completely against raising taxes. Right. There isn't a compromise. There  isn't, that's their platform. Their constituency has said, we don't want our taxes raised. Yeah. So  then they goof on them about not compromising and right. But that's what they're, they're representing  their people. Honestly, it's like, they're actually saying we're not going to raise taxes.  Yeah. It's like, it's like a complaint, going to a football game and complaining there aren't  enough innings or something. It's just like, no, that's what they do. You moron. Occupy 
[02:31:00]  Wall Street. It's like there was celebrities that go down, they'd give treats. Like I went  down there one day and I handed out lemon clurds. I mean, where the hostess puts those  out? Yes. They're, they're, they're the size of an everlasting gobstopper. They're, they're  lemon and it's filled with milk and salmon eggs. I love it. I love a good box of lemon  clurds. Okay. This has to be a book of Jim Norton's magical treats. Yes. You can, you 
[02:31:30]  can just get a great photographer. He still hasn't written his, uh, his other idea. Uh,  what is it? Boats down there. Oh yeah. He's got another, I want to take photos from  bridges of boats and just call it boats down there and just have, it's going to  be a coffee table book. Yeah. So he's got to write that first before he does a snack  book. Well, what else is in the book there? Uh, Greg Gutfeld. Uh, just other, other crap.  Uh, talk about being a smoker. Do you guys, none of you guys smoke? No, no. Yeah, I still 
[02:32:00]  smoke a little bit, not as much as I used to, but it's the idea that because in our  culture, you cannot make fun of people. Oh, there's boats down there. Um, because  you can't make fun of anybody anymore. Uh, smokers are an acceptable target. So I  have a whole chapter about how people have heckled me while walking down the  street, not because they know me, but because I'm smoking. Well, you guys just  look silly at this point. Yeah, exactly. I mean, where you could, you could stand in  a two foot by two foot. We are lepers. I do find it funny. I find that I, I miss that 
[02:32:30]  because I I've gone out with you guys after the show and stuff. And, uh, you  know, when you sit and then you guys take off and go outside to smoke. Yeah. I feel  like I'm missing out on half the conversation because I'm only getting the  inside the bar. Right. Yeah. On the outside of the bar. And I'm like, what's  what's a, you can hear the person B can definitely shit talk. Yeah. But you know  what it is. It also, uh, forces you to be with, cause you might not like the person 
[02:33:00]  you're smoking with. And so you're out there with that person and making  conversation. You always just want to be alone. Fascinating conversations under  those circumstances where you, you know, someone smokes, you're like, Oh fuck,  let's have a cigarette together. And you're talking to someone you're most  likely likely would never talk to. No, I think it's the opposite. I think  you're out there and generally there'll be the, the drunk women who are out with  the girls night out and they never smoke. And they've had like, Oh my God, this  is now they're going to smoke. And they look at you like a cigarette tree. It costs 
[02:33:30]  15 bucks for a pack of smokes. And so I say no. And it's great because a woman  like in her late twenties will come up and they'll be very, Oh, hi. How are  you? Blah, blah, blah. Give me a second. And you say no. And they, and then they  just unleash invective. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, it's like screaming. I go, Oh, well  that's how you really feel about me. Cause they can't grasp that you're not  fucking kissing her ass and giving her a cigarette. Yeah. I'm not going to give you  a cigarette because you think you're cute. Yeah. When did you stop giving away  cigarettes? Cause they were just flat out too expensive. When they went up  in price, at what price? Uh, I think around eight bucks. They're now 15 bucks 
[02:34:00]  a pack. 13 and a quarter. Crazy. Yeah. But I know I can't, now it's like, uh, you  basically ask, I go, you're no different than a panhandler. You're asking me for  a dollar. Yeah. You know? And, uh, and I see the same people on where I live and I,  I, I engage them. I go, you should just, you spend so much time bothering me when you  could just work and buy yourself a pack of cigarettes. Do you know, here's the, here's  the conversation you're missing out on outside. Yeah. It's fucking cold. I got 
[02:34:30]  to quit. You're right. That's right. That's right. I'm trying to, I mean, it is, it's  Oh, but the thing is, I, you know, I worked at men's health. I did a, uh, a long story  on, uh, cigarette studies. Most of the studies were done on, uh, some heavy smokers or people  that smoked a pack or maybe I think the minimum was 10, 10 a day. I never rise above like seven  cigarettes a day. And I think that like, like anything, you know, that's moderation  moderation. And I, you know, you don't feel different health wise. Um, I, now that you've 
[02:35:00]  been out a while, I can tell after a long night of drinking and smoking next day is horrible,  but I can't figure out which one is doing it. It's amazing to me that you're as productive  as you are. Cause Godfell writes a lot of, a lot of, I'll just, you know, these, uh, when  you would do the fucking, uh, Oh God, the boy, the monologue is called the Greg log. Um,  you're now doing this show. You're, you're extremely high, uh, functional, productive  for a guy who basically lives like I did in 1985. Greg gets a lot of stuff done. A lot  of drinking. You know what I, what I, I always have this, that internal discussion that all 
[02:35:30]  of this stuff has to go at some point as I'm 48, but I wonder if I, what happens? I don't  know. Like I'm more productive. You're not going to lose you. We convince ourselves that these  weird, addictive behaviors are a part of who we are and a part of our, our being and a  part of our makeup and personality and persona, but they're distractions. And I know cause  I'm still that way with sex. It's like, it's really like, what will I be without it? Or  what would I be without cigarettes? And I'm much more productive without cigarettes.  What's your, what's your thing?  Boy, you must've been really not productive. 
[02:36:00]  A lot of drinking, Greg.  Uh, I drink a lot of wine, a lot of wine, a lot of wine. Yeah. I drink, I probably drink  like four times a week and I probably have maybe three or four glasses.  Wine is some good shit, man.  But I, it's horrible. Hang on. I tell, see, I don't get the hangover with red wine, white  wine. I do brutal. But then I ended up smoking and I can't figure it out if there's three  variables, lack of sleep, the wine or the cigarettes that makes you feel bad. I don't 
[02:36:30]  know. Yeah. The, uh, this, I remember the cigarettes though were terrible because when  you're out drinking, you do smoke more. Holy shit. And, uh, especially when you could  smoke in the bars. Yeah. It was just insane. You would not even, sometimes you forget that  you had a cigarette lit, you light another one and you're like, Oh, I had one lit.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's a, it's a wonderful thing, especially when you're traveling and  you end up in a state where you can still smoke in a bar and you have to do it. And you feel  like you're in mad men. This is the greatest feeling ever. You forget though. You forget. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah. How, how that was, but when you came home, I mean, as a non-smoker and everything  would stop. And I can't believe we didn't notice that back then. Yeah. Or yeah. Or  you couldn't even go to a, you couldn't even go to a sporting event. Everyone's cars just  reeked of cigarette smoke. Exactly. And you would go on a road trip for four hours with  somebody who smoked and you never complained and you'd just be going and putting it out  in this big, remember the ashtray would be overflowing with 50 cigarettes and you would  just kind of like, and then we, you would run out of smokes. So you'd go into the ashtray 
[02:37:30]  and find a clip, find it, find anything you can that you can smoke. And I forgot, remember  ashtrays? Like how I like that. Cause I have a line of ashtray hats and earrings I make,  um, where they're really, you're so creative. It's like a little, it's a glass ashtray that  you go on your head and it rubber band ties under your chin and it's listed on my website.  Lovely cigarette accessories. You should come up with some nicotine snacks.  They could do marijuana snacks at these, at these medicinal joints. Yeah. What's wrong 
[02:38:00]  with a little tobacco? What a little bit of a little tobacco candy for adults. A sigichu.  You call it a sigichu. Being a kid, my dad driving and, and just smoking his tarrytons  like crazy with the windows rolled up completely and you're just basking in a smoke cloud. The,  the ashtray too, that giant pull out ashtray right above it on the dashboard thing. It looked  like a window from a house that had a fire. Like it was just, it was just all black and  goopy. But you know what the, so what's happening then is we are, as a people are evolving into 
[02:38:30]  these weak creatures that if we smell cigarettes, we get nauseous. It's like, we do the fake  cough. We were kids. We could, we could be in a tight, tiny Honda Civic. Yeah. Like in  a cloud of smoke and we were, our eyes wouldn't get red. We wouldn't get nauseous. But now we're  like weak. Yeah. But even worse than that, our parents were smoking when they were pregnant  with us. My mom was. So right to the womb, we were smoking and drinking. We were getting  some fucking smoke. Smoking and drinking. Yeah. I went cross country in a Fort Pinto with 
[02:39:00]  my dad and his girl and my brother. And, uh, they just, she smoked Marlboro Lights. He  smoked tarrytons. And we were in the back laying down in that Pinto hatchback. That car was  fucking, that's great. That car was smoked out the entire drive. 3,000 fucking miles.  The windows would be all cloudy. And they would get that brown, like tinge to them. Everything,  the headline, remember the headliners on the old cars? Yeah. They were like white with the  little pinholes in them. It looked like it would turn like brown, just turn brown. This 
[02:39:30]  is what, this is what young people are missing in life. I mean, what, how can you get, I mean,  that was abuse. That was abuse. Like Jimmy's asshole is right now. No, it would be considered  abuse right now. Literally would be considered child abuse. No, they do say you can get in some  states. In some states, you can be arrested or fine. I'm not sure which, if you are smoking  with a kid in the backseat, they introduced this bill. I don't know if they passed it,  but I remember, isn't it great how I have 10% of a news story? That's all you need. And 
[02:40:00]  I'm just saying that, yeah, it happened. And you're different than us. How? We're not,  we've heard it too. Yeah, exactly. We're right there with you. I never heard this. There  were even other things like that, uh, the back window of the cars used to have that shelf  and you stuff like speakers in there and stuff. As a kid, I would crawl up there and just  like lay down as my dad's doing 70 miles an hour. I would have been the little projectile.  Yeah. No seatbelts. No seatbelts. Everybody was tired. But it was a little warmer up there  too. You always knew people that were dying because car accidents. You were like a lizard  just sunning yourself. Just a little warmer up there. Ah, nice. Any tap the car would take 
[02:40:30]  in any direction, you were fatality. Didn't matter. Everything was iron. Everything fucking  metal. Do they even still do those, uh, those, uh, uh, those things in school, those, uh,  hamburger on the highway and those films. Yeah. The films that like, we're sure they do.  Yes. I don't remember like, yeah, I remember red asphalt, red asphalt is a good one. Yeah.  We call those hamburger on the highway. One of your snack cakes. Yes, it is. It is Jimmy  red asphalt. Yes. What's in it. Well, it's, it's a chocolatey, delicious treat with a lot 
[02:41:00]  of Tabasco sauce in it. And it's called the red asphalt. Sounds spicy. Yeah, it is. It's delicious.  And it's spelled A-S-S dash F-A-U-L-T. Oh, it's like an asshole. And there's a winky face  afterwards. Because it's what happens afterwards. As in, see what we're doing here, huh? Asshole.  Yeah. What else about the book there, Greg? I want to make sure we sell a lot of copies  here. Yeah, this, uh, joy of hate. I love how you go after the mainstream media. I'm a huge  fan of that. Well, yeah, I mean, it's like, they, they are, they're the biggest dupes in, 
[02:41:30]  in the, what I would call the modern tolerance movement. And they don't even see that it can turn  on them. Because they can, they will, they will join with the rest of the clowns. Let's  say if, if you say something on this show, uh, other, there'll be other people in the  media that will dive in and say, and, and, uh, and, and go after you for it. With their  outrage. With their outrage. But then a month later, one of their guys will do the same thing.  Yeah. Uh, they'll, and it's now Twitter has created an entire universe of, of people apologizing 
[02:42:00]  or something they tweeted that guy that I haven't in my, I have a chapter on this, the  dude, Roland Martin, that tweeted about David Beckham. Uh, and then the other thing, um,  the guy that had to resign for the Oscars because he said rehearsal was, uh, Brett was, uh, Brett,  uh, Ratner. To your point earlier, he was able to parrot a glad letter within an hour.  Uh, the moment he made that comment about gays, he, he said rehearsal is for the F word. And  then he had to, he resigned in an hour. There was already a letter. It was like a, a very, 
[02:42:30]  very, uh, articulate letter, which you know, he didn't write saying how he was going to  be, you know, get more involved in these issues and he's going to create a dialogue. And then  he's done any of that stuff. He disappeared. No, he's just what he did. He had to go through  that period. But he wasn't talking about the games and everyone knows that. That's the point  of outrage. That's the point of outrage. You know what it is? I have a chapter, uh, talking  about the word misconstrued. Everybody knows what you mean, but they misconstrue it on 
[02:43:00]  purpose. It's like, we know that you weren't being homophobic, but because you used the  word that we deem evil, we're going to come after you and say that it could be like, I  have a chapter about a guy who said that all the, he was in a Texas politician. He said  that all the paperwork was going through into a black hole. They were losing it. And then  the judge and everybody said, that's racist. And they attacked him for saying black hole.  It's like, it meant nothing. Yeah. You, we know what he meant. We know what he meant.  The problem is too, when people are attacked with this stuff, you're right. It's a dishonest, 
[02:43:30]  it's not even misconstrued. It's a dishonest ignoring of the real meaning and the intended  meaning. Yes. And, uh, people do not fight back, uh, with, with venom. Like, you know,  they take an apologetic, you know, I did instead of attacking the dishonesty of the outrage,  they're immediately put on the defensive and people instead of, yeah, attacking back and  don't screw you. I didn't, they're like, well, I don't, I'm sorry, but look, I didn't mean  it. Yeah. No, it, because the worst thing you could be called is a racist, racist, homophobic, 
[02:44:00]  whatever. Yeah. Homophobic. So if you're, uh, if, if you're on a show, you make a mistake  that the rest of the media should like be going like, not even if it's a mistake, if it's just  misconstrued, I'm trying to think of like other, other things that you said, you would say  20 years from now, but because they could be misconstrued. Yeah. Don't be short with  me. Yeah. Exactly. You won't be allowed to say that. Yeah. Exactly. And Coulter took  some heat for that. Oh my God. And Pierce Morgan was just kind of going after her and 
[02:44:30]  she just, she's unapologetic. I envy her because she doesn't have a boss, right? She could just  walk through life and say whatever, whatever she wants. And then she does what you do, what  you said. If somebody comes at her, she says, screw you. She just says, screw you. But even  though she doesn't have a boss to answer to, let's say she did and everything happened  the way it did. It just goes to show that you don't have to fire these people. She's  been fine. People actually, when you fight back like that, they leave you alone. Right. 
[02:45:00]  They want the easy marks. Yeah. So if she had a boss, let's say that let her just do it  and didn't tell her about it. They smell cowardice. Yeah. And they're bullies. That's the other  thing too about, we have this modern bullying movement. Yeah. It's how, how hilarious is  it that generally these people that are anti-bullying are the people that are bullying. They're the  ones bullying. The only argument I heard that made sense to me, because this was after the  Tracy Morgan said gays or he said faggot or he said something that was very, very unpopular  with gays on stage. So I did a show on the comedy channel where I wanted to interview gay 
[02:45:30]  comic friends of mine and say, how do you feel as not only gay guys, but as standups?  And they, uh, they kind of felt like, well, they don't like the language police, but a  guy named Jim David raised an interesting point. He, I said, does it bother you that there's  a, a, a, a double standard in the language? Cause there is, and as a comic that drives me  nuts. And he goes, it doesn't bother me as much because he said it's not a level playing  field in life. If it was a level playing field, it would probably bother me. And I'm paraphrasing, 
[02:46:00]  but I looked at his point and I'm like, all right, that is a valid point. Like he feels  as a gay man, he's, he's discriminated against, or he's not given the right to marry or all  these other things. So he doesn't feel bad for people if they have a disproportionate  amount of being penalized in language. And I'm not saying that I agree with it, but I  kind of see like, it's not a crazy person's point of view.  What's this fucking robotic level playing field everybody wants? It's called fucking organic  life. It's not level. And sometimes, uh, it's going to change year to year. The gays, 
[02:46:30]  I think have a lot better, a lot better now than they did years ago, like blacks and a  lot of minority groups. But to keep saying that the level, the field isn't level, then  level it yourself through your actions and, and, uh, through perseverance and hard work.  But fair enough. But do you feel that like, but look at it, but when you're on the other  side of the unlevel playing field, it's frustrating. Like with taxes, I'm on the other  side of the unlevel playing field and I don't look at it like tough shit. Stop taking my  fucking money. Stop taking my money. I see how angry that makes me. And he, but he wasn't 
[02:47:00]  being irrational. He wasn't saying, but you know, it's like he just can't live life the  way he wants to live life because the government says you can't get, you can't. But how is  me saying my friends being a faggot cause he won't come out like and, and hang out at  a bar that night. Right. Which means nothing sexually. I agree. It's absolutely just, he's  being the old vernacular, the growing up. But you know what? I, I, I'm like fine with  like getting rid of words, like not getting rid of, but like not using words. I, what 
[02:47:30]  bothers me is the, the outrage that comes from saying the word is so beyond what the  crime is. Right. It's like, you know, if you, if let's say you said that and you're  there, you know, you're in a gay bar. Right. Nah, it's probably not a good idea. I probably  wouldn't say it in that circumstance. Not saying you wouldn't, it's funny. I wouldn't  say that. You're not saying I wouldn't be in a gay bar. You're saying, you know, you're  fucking mind your P's and Q's. But the question is, where does it end? Yeah. Where does it  end before enough with, uh, you know, banning all these words? It's a very, cause everyone 
[02:48:00]  wants their word ban now. Yes. Everybody wants to start with the N word. And then it was  the F word. It gives you a little interest group, a power base to be able to say, Hey,  look, we got a word that no one could use. But I like, see, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'll tell you  what's happening. I'm okay with like not using words. If it, if, if it makes sense, it is  when they call it code words. Oh, when it's like, when it's like, it's not, it's now two  levels removed. Yeah. Um, if, if you, if you mentioned like, you know, hip hop, yeah. 
[02:48:30]  Somebody's into hip hop. Oh, what does that mean? Well, Chicago at one point was being looked  at like, well, that he's playing Chicago politics. Well, you're, you might as well drop the N  bomb there and say, that's what he's doing. Yeah. That comes right. That becomes this whole  thing about, uh, what's the woman's name? Uh, who's involved in the Benghazi thing? Rice.  Yeah. Uh, talk just actually criticizing her. Uh, uh, now it's like just criticizing is  considered racist. They can't imagine American woman, right? They cannot imagine why, by 
[02:49:00]  the way, the, uh, conservative, the right, the Republicans are getting on her and saying  because the left is, is pretty much saying, well, she was just given these notes and reading  them. How do you blame that? It's like, I remember another black woman named Rice that  apparently just read the company line from her president and got shit on. Yep. Um, but  for some reason she should just be left alone and leave this alone. She shouldn't testify.  It's ridiculous. What do you think of this? Uh, that, uh, how this Benghazi thing is kind 
[02:49:30]  of bubbling over. You know, the thing that bugs me is it should have been bubbling over  before the election. Exactly. And he, and they, everybody played along the media played  along. They hid the scandal. They hid the scandal and it's crazy. This, uh, and then the,  then on top you have the sex scandal, which is absolutely fantastic. I can't get enough  of this. At least you're honest about it because the media would say, Oh, we're so high minded.  We need a real thing. But then they avoid Benghazi and leap at Ben cheating because that's  more fun part of it. Yeah. That's more fun. And by the way, it is more fun because it's 
[02:50:00]  not as grim, right? But the fact is the grim story is how you create Woodward and Bernstein's  how you win awards. You know, there's, I can't believe there's no like enterprising young  journalists going like, boy, this Benghazi thing, you know, the Washington Post should  have somebody on this. It's amazing how they just tow that line of the, the, the left  and, and, uh, the Democrats. The fact of the matter is I just saw that stat that came out  the last week of the election, not one negative Obama story on MSNBC and not one positive Romney  story on MSNBC for a whole fucking week. You couldn't find one thing, especially with 
[02:50:30]  Benghazi going on one thing to criticize the president on. Why am I surprised? And I still,  it's a really weird disappointment I have in liberals. Like, uh, I'm, I'm, I'm kind  of like libertarian. I think like yourself, like, and the conservatives I've found to  be very, uh, irritating with a lot of their free speech issues. And I have a lot of criticisms  about Bush and the way the FCC was handled, but I'm not surprised. I don't know why I continually  feel disappointed by the medias and liberals. Like I, I really, I guess I still have a lot  of, why am I shocked? Like I know they're hypocrites. I know, I know the conservatives can 
[02:51:00]  be hypocrites. I'm not shocked. Why am I shocked when liberals try to be hypocrites? Like, I  don't know why that still shocks me, but it does.  The worst thing though, is, you know, you're talking about these, the media is supposed  to be the champion of free expression and nobody cares that that filmmaker's in jail.  Right. Even the ACLU. Where the fuck is he? It's like, nobody even talks about it. No  one. They blame this whole thing on a filmmaker and they find out it's a lie. So they find  out the whole thing's not true, that there was no spontaneous mob. So they have this guy 
[02:51:30]  in jail and they're saying up for a parole or a probation thing. But they never would have  known that. Wouldn't have known it. And without any of this, no one ever would have spent this  much time in jail for that type of violation. But for a film, can you imagine in Obama's  America, a filmmaker's in jail, filmmakers in jail. Yeah. It's insane. Crazy. And where's  the left? Crazy. That's why, that's why I hate the left lately because they do not defend 
[02:52:00]  people anymore. They disagree. The ACLU will sometimes fight for the Klan and things like  that. But they did actually recently. They do. That's the easy thing they're supposed to  do though. Cause it's so obvious. And when you say you're surprised, you're, you're constantly  surprised for some reason by the left. It's the perception of the left and the right.  The right's perception is these stiff motherfuckers. So they don't disappoint you because they're  acting like they're presented to you. The left is being presented as this liberal, open-minded,  look at us, willing to accept. And then, so when they pull this shit, you're like, wait, 
[02:52:30]  this isn't supposed to be. You guys are bullshitting on this. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. And it's disappointing  to me every time. And that's why I hit liberals a lot harder than conservatives. Cause again,  I expect they claim to be this place of free thought and free expression. And I, I know  they're just as full of shit, but yet every time I'm shocked and angered. When the liberals  call out Republicans or the right, um, it's never a surprising thing. It's like, oh, this  is occasionally you get the foot tapping under the bathroom stall door, which is a treat.  But also it's, it's so predictable. They're outraged. Like, uh, if they find out that I work 
[02:53:00]  for Fox news, it's the same kind of like, uh, faux news lies or, you know, that kind  of like, oh, and that's like, when do you, would you watch it? He goes, no, I don't watch  it. Shut up. It's always the same kind of like tired thing. And they, the worst thing  about it is they pretend to be edgy. Yes. They are not edgy. They're fake mavericks. They're  fucking safe cornball rebels who are really towing a big company line, but they act like they're 
[02:53:30]  really screaming. Like you said before, truth to power and they're not. Yeah. I have seen  so much like political diversity on Fox more so than any other. Red eye is a zoo. It's  crazy. You get fucking hardcore. You know, I think the last time I was on, I was sitting  next to one of the most lefty motherfuckers and we were, we were laughing, but it's, I've  seen most of the shows I see on Fox, they present two sides. They have the, you know, the  left and the right. Bill Schultz is very liberal. He's Greg's co-host. Yeah. When you, when 
[02:54:00]  I watch the most lefty person I know. Yeah. You watch MSNBC though. Nary a fucking, even  somebody in the middle can't be found. With that, with that said, you ever run into the  MSNBC guys? Well, and how do they treat you? I, I, I, every now and then I'll see somebody  on the street, but we, there's no conversation. I mean, I know Etsy. You give each other dirty  looks. Yeah. But Etsy was a regular on red eye. She's their token. She's the token conservative.  But, uh, um, I, I saw Ed Schultz once walking up. He was wearing, uh, long oversized khaki 
[02:54:30]  shorts and black socks. He looked like a, he looked like a German kid at fat camp.  He was like, take that Schultz. We were sitting at that, we were sitting at that bar that we  were at, that one we went to when Breitbart had the, uh, picture. Oh shit. Yeah. Was it  Langan's or? No, it was that other place. Oh yeah. The other place. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And  he was walking, we were out there and we were just walking, watching Ed Schultz walk by  and it was like, he really looked like, he looked like also he could have been drawn  by the Mike judge and King of the Hill with the shaky squiggly line. Seems like he's a 
[02:55:00]  bit of a phony. Yeah. He's, he's, that guy is pure manufactured anger. Of course. They  were campaigning for the president. I mean, and a lot of the media was, you look at NBC and  a lot of their edited things of Romney to make it seem like he was coming off like a buffoon  instead of tagging on the last part of what he said, which pretty much justified the  beginning. Like shit like that is it's criminal. Yeah. It's fucking criminal. Yeah. The way  they edit, like I Twittered something about the 60 minutes releasing the Obama. Yeah. But 
[02:55:30]  that piece is a couple of days before the election. Yeah. And I didn't care about that either  way. My, and the people like, well, why does it matter? My, my, my anger wasn't at the  political side of it. It was at the media not releasing that even after, uh, uh, a stupid  Candy Crowley interrupts, uh, incorrectly and backs up. Amazing. That's what bothered  me was how that was not her job. This, this, this dummy interrupts wrongly siding with the  president. And I didn't care who was right or wrong. That issue didn't really matter to 
[02:56:00]  me. It didn't matter. The issue was that she did anything in that situation. My issue was  the way the media handled it or when they edited, um, in the, the Trayvon shooting and NBC won't  release the name of the scumbag who edits this. And the issue is not how you feel about  race or politics. It's that the media is editing this stuff. That's the disgusting part. Oh,  what does he look like? He's black. And they just cut out everything. He's saying, is he  black? Yeah, I think it's black. There's a whole, but there's a whole industry, you know, 
[02:56:30]  based on that. If you take away, if you take away racism, then there's a lot of people out  of work. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, going back to that, the other thing too, that Crowley  thing was bigger than you think, because it, it, it scared Romney. That's not a nice  way to discuss her. Yeah. I'm sorry. She was a monster. No, her, her interrupting changed  the next debate. Yes. He didn't, he, uh, he, she scared Romney off the topic. And so the  final debate, which should have been about Libya, uh, he mentioned it twice. That was  it. I'll say that's Romney's fault though, because that's where Romney, like I agree. And 
[02:57:00]  I'm going to say that Obama on the back, that foreign policy debate looked much stronger and  Romney's got to work through that shit. Yeah. He's got to understand that game. He's  got to try to work through that shit. Somebody told him not to go there. And that, that was  bad between the combination of that and hurricane Sandy. Yeah. The Sandy thing and fucking, um,  didn't help. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, you know, what, what are you going to do? So I, you know,  it's like, by the way, I mean, still, you know, these things are cyclical in two years when,  when, usually when you put liberals in charge, certain, certain things happen that create more 
[02:57:30]  conservatives, right? You know, it's just, uh, the reason why, uh, Obama won and Romney  lost is the Republican party just doesn't know how to articulate their message. And make  it seem relevant. They have a hard time with that. I think you, yeah, midterms, I think  we're going to see, uh, some changes happen, but I don't, I, you know, it's unfortunate  that there's just not a third option. And we talk about that a lot and everybody talks  about that, but I don't identify, like I envy people who have like Ann Coulter, who I love,  I disagree with, eh, not half what she says, but I'd say about 30% of it. I'm on the other 
[02:58:00]  side of the fence, but I envy the genuine conviction she has. Like that feeling of this  is who I am and how I feel like I don't have that. I go back and forth. Like, eh, I don't  know. I can't commit to one side. Dedication to a side and actually look at it like you're  a racist or homophobic or you can't, we've gotten to the point where you can't criticize  the president or you're racist. I mean, and not even just like by the idiot on Twitter.  I mean, politicians, people that are supposedly running this country are saying, oh, you can't 
[02:58:30]  talk like that to the president. You're going to, you know, you're a racist. It was actually  a genius move, right? Brilliant. It's like, can't criticize. Republicans got to find a gay  native American. There you go. How dare you? You want to be able to say, how dare you? And  the person, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please. What else in  the book there, Greg? I opened up and saw in Greg's book, which I loved. It was a brilliant 
[02:59:00]  point about how they're complaining about it's racist to ask for IDs at the voting booth,  Eric Holder. But when you want to go visit him, you have to show ID.  Yeah. Some guy, I can't remember who did that experiment. He would just try to walk in and  they would stop him. But the whole thing is, it's like, you know, you can argue about immigration  all you want, but just the idea of talking about borders is now racist. Right. Every  country has a border. In fact, the people that are leaving their countries to come here 
[02:59:30]  have tighter and better borders than we do. Right. And somehow if we just say, look, we just  want some kind of organization about immigration, just a way to get in. And I happen to think  it's the more people, given the laziness of some of the people born here that I know  personally, I like, you know, immigrants are great for a country, but you've got to have  a system. There's got to be a system. But the second you say that you want some kind of  system in place, they make it. They'll tell you these speeches about, you know, this nation 
[03:00:00]  was built on immigration. If we didn't have the people coming in, we wouldn't have this  diversity and great. It's like, that isn't the argument you're making here. The argument  is people swarming over here without being checked. I mean, it's dangerous to the economy.  It's dangerous to national security. Yeah. A system. But then just by using the word swarm.  Swarm is a bad code word. It's a code word. Swarm. You're comparing immigrants to bees. 
[03:00:30]  Right. Locusts. Locusts. Eating the environment. Leaving devastation in their wake. Exactly.  Yes. You're going to have to apologize for that. No, but just the debate, the simple debate  on borders, the argument of racism will always put you in the defensive. Yes. But it shouldn't.  And if you argue that point, if you argue, I guess I want to say with rancor back, it backs  people off because their argument is garbage anyway. Yeah. And I would never allow that 
[03:01:00]  to take place. I would never take an apologetic tone. And the problem is people are so scared  by that. They take an apology. I get into a lot of racial discussions on Twitter and whatnot.  And I am absolutely unapologetic. I try to argue with as many actual statistics as I can  and whatnot. But I will always, always be called out as a racist because it's the easiest  thing to just peg on you. Once you have that scarlet R on your shirt, you're somehow, your 
[03:01:30]  point isn't valid anymore. Yeah. Especially when you put out that newsletter, I'm a racist.  Right.  Which is like that. I publish that.  I'm so brave of you, but it really does put a, it puts a target on your back.  Does it? Yeah.  I just thought it explained a little more.  My whole stance.  Yeah, it's White Hood Publishing is the name of it.  Yeah, exactly.  Your manifesto.  I guess I shouldn't link Stormfront to my Facebook page. KKK dash LOL.  The fact that you know Stormfront scares me.  Yeah.  Stormfront's always a scary thing when you like, when you get a Google alert and it's 
[03:02:00]  Stormfront and if they, oh God.  Yeah, what is this?  Hey, I'm beginning to like what this guy says.  Yeah, oh boy.  I actually was reading a tad off of Stormfront and David Duke was writing some shit for them  and I was reading it and all I was thinking was, here's a guy and obviously he was involved  with the Ku Klux Klan.  He was the head of the Ku Klux Klan.  He was the head, involved, head of the Klan, who then decided to try to enter the system,  the legitimate system. 
[03:02:30]  And I really don't see much of a difference between him and his hate group and him then  going what they call legit than I do with Reverend Al and what he did and his instigating  over the years.  I mean, the fact that most people these days do not remember Tawana Brawley is an injustice.  I mean, we all, I mean, I guess I was living.  Freddie's Fashion Mart, all that, the Greek homos.  Greek homos.  All these things he said.  He said horrible things.  Yeah.  The instigator in the Crown Heights episodes where it was Reverend Al and that he was invited 
[03:03:00]  to the White House to meet with the president over economics.  It's like, what, do you remember what he did?  Would you have David Duke?  Yeah.  There, if David Duke said, you know, oh, that was the past.  Yeah.  I was the head of the Klan.  But look, now I'm just talking about conservatism.  And no, they would never have him there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Reverend Al gets a pass.  Yeah.  It goes after everyone else for doing the same thing.  Exactly.  Oh, please.  That's what's amazing.  Al Sharpton went after Imus for saying nappy-headed hoes. 
[03:03:30]  Yet, what he said.  But he said way worse.  And he was responsible for people getting killed and ruining lives.  Yes.  Did you think he must hire somebody to scrub the web?  Like, you know, he must get that.  Have you ever seen that hat?  What's that service?  Yeah.  He must have to do that every day because it's like his past is like poisonous weeds that  grow.  Just keep growing.  There's so many incidents in his life that are just so despicable.  Right.  Like, you don't hear about it.  People don't hold him accountable.  And then MSNBC hires him.  I do think because he's also religious that I think that's the guise of religion. 
[03:04:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Because I don't think it's an honest religion that he has.  Imus should have never went on his radio show.  No.  Imus should have attacked him for what he did.  Imus sat there.  That was disappointing.  When he said, I'm sorry I said that.  I didn't mean to say that.  Why are you apologizing?  And then basically he takes his spot on MSNBC.  Yeah.  Yes.  I was thinking of Imus.  I was told that Greg mentioned me on Imus.  I did.  I almost said it was a nice thing.  I didn't hear the clip, though.  I can't remember.  It's because I think I thanked you or something in the book. 
[03:04:30]  And then he said, all right.  Tim Norton's a great guy.  He's a funny man.  He's a funny man.  I didn't read your book, though.  Uh-oh.  I read it.  Bernie's a good guy.  Bernie will love.  Yeah.  Kids are doing well.  Yeah.  He's sitting here with Imus.  He comes up with some thought starters.  And then you take that and run with it.  He's a good guy.  What do you do with that if he says it?  I just like doing this voice.  I know.  It's a great voice.  Coming up.  Coming up.  Coming up, we got a lot of stuff. 
[03:05:00]  Give me one more topic in the book that's not politics, just so we make sure we sell this  properly for you.  Oh, moobs.  What?  First chapters on moobs.  This is a perfect example of fake tolerance.  When there is a wanted poster of a criminal that is shirtless, a male criminal, and if  he has male boobs, they will blur it.  So to me, that is a metaphor for phony outrage.  Those aren't female breasts.  They're male breasts, but they have to blur them because they appear to look like female 
[03:05:30]  breasts.  Come on.  That's exactly what this book is about.  It's about people who know that's not really the outrageous thing, but we're going to pretend  it's outrageous.  But it looks a little too much like it.  But we still know that that's a guy.  We know it's not.  Those are male breasts.  But we...  It offends me that it looks like a female breast, so we must blur it.  He goes, it's not really offensive, and you know that.  Yeah.  That's the story of this book.  Wow.  Very good.  All right.  That's a great metaphor, yeah.  I'm looking forward to reading this one. 
[03:06:00]  All right.  Very cool.  I guess Jimmy's going to be on Red Eye...  Tomorrow?  Tomorrow?  Tomorrow.  Awesome.  I'm trying to...  Come up with more snacks.  I'll have a bunch.  He'll have a bunch for you tomorrow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I have a...  You should make one and bring it in for the guy.  Well, you know what it is?  I'm waiting.  I order lima beans because my lima sherbet is very popular.  It's a warm with hard lima beans inside and a nice lima coating on the outside.  It's weird until you call it a sherbet, but it's piping hot. 
[03:06:30]  Yes.  It's really weird.  Yeah, that's the irony of it.  It tricks the little children who want to eat it quickly.  Mama.  Mama, me man sherbet.  It's a terrible thing.  Lots of hospital visits because of your lima bean sherbet.  On New Year's Eve, I will be in Buffalo at the Helium Comedy Club.  I'm sorry to hear that.  You and me both.  And my new CD, which was taped in 2007, is called No Baby For You.  And it releases the 12th of...  I mean, the 11th of December. 
[03:07:00]  Great.  I'm now on Netflix by one hour special.  Greg Gutfeld, The Joy of Hate.  Thank you, guys.  Available now.  A lot of people talking about it.  It's just one of these...  It's a great book that is honest.  It's timely.  And it's shit you don't see these days.  And it's funny.  Greg's a brilliant writer.  He's calling out these fucking...  The fake outrage.  Yeah.  It's outraging.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's funny.  What?  You fucking did your own thing.  I did my own thing.  Yeah.  I unplugged my own book.  He's got Dennis Miller talking about the book, Ant Coulter, a bunch of other guys, and then 
[03:07:30]  Greg Gutfeld talking about his book.  Yeah.  That's funny, man.  Did not recommend it.  Has anyone picked up on that yet?  Nobody has, because nobody ever reads those.  So that's why I did it.  I just decided to put myself on the back.  You know how books have the quotes from all these people?  I mean, that's really good.  Bravo to you, sir.  Thank you.  Also, let me see here.  My brother, obviously, is telling me to plug our gig.  What is that?  I don't know, but I got a lot of Atlantic City tweets in the way here that I was supposed  to...  I was supposed to actually... 
[03:08:00]  Let me load earlier.  Oh, boy.  Oh, is that it?  What is it?  There it is.  That's in December, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's okay, though.  Because people can go to 89NorthMusicVenue.com.  89NorthMusicVenue.com.  We're at 89 North in December on the 23rd.  Rot Gut.  Night Before Christmas Eve.  And the Journey cover venue.  Actually, Journey.  Journey.  Journey's stopping by.  It might as well be.  Awesome.  They're better than Journey.  Yeah.  Check it out.  I got to go, because I'm doing Stuart Varney in 15 minutes. 
[03:08:30]  Ooh.  I got to run.  Who's Stuart Varney?  Fox Business.  Okay.  Fox Business.  It's across the street, but I got to run down and put on some makeup.  All right.  Greg, thanks so much, man.  Nice to see you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  Don't be a stranger.  I won't.  I'm always around.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is pretty much over.  This show will be available later today with SiriusXM On Demand.  After ONA Live is next.  SiriusXM. 
[03:09:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  That's my name.  It's After O.P. and Anthony Live.  Phone number to call is 866-WOW1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  If you call, and you just start hearing the show, it's because Sal's in here cleaning up  the studio. 
[03:09:30]  And I put you on hold.  You don't need to get scared and hang up.  People do that all the time.  Just because I don't talk to you right away doesn't mean I'm not going to eventually.  Big show today, and I'll tell you why.  Number one, always great to hear Mr. Greg Gutfeld on the radio.  Host of Fox News Red Eye.  You know, we get to, you know, the hardcore ONA fans that pay attention to everything that  the guys do.  They get to see Greg Gutfeld quite a bit, because Norton will be on Red Eye.  Anthony will be on Red Eye.  You know, he's associated with the show in that way. 
[03:10:00]  But he's not on our show all that much.  And so it's always nice to see The Joy of Hate is the name of the book, which again,  it ties right into the show.  As Ant said, if anybody can sympathize with that, if anybody, empathize is the word I'm  looking for.  If anybody understands The Joy of Hate and what it is to just spend your days hating, it's  Anthony.  As he's said many times, he actively looks for things to get him upset.  They hung up. 
[03:10:30]  They got scared.  See, normally I can put somebody on hold and then real quick, I can pick somebody up and  real quick put them on hold, but they hang up immediately.  You get the dial tone.  But yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's also always good to hear somebody who's on television talk about the things that  we talk about, because normally the people on television can't really point out the hypocrisies  and the bullshit that happens as far as being politically correct and thought policing and 
[03:11:00]  chasing people for apologies and just all the nonsense that happens on all these TV shows  and that all these pundits do to everybody who's on the radio or anybody who's expressing  an opinion anywhere, whether it be on a comedy stage, regardless, anybody who's expressing  an opinion gets thought policed by these pundits.  And it's awesome that there's one guy who's actually on one of these news channels that  will come out and say, yeah, you guys are right.  It's bullshit.  That's why I wrote this book. 
[03:11:30]  That's why I'm not fighting the system.  I'm trying to get in and change it from the inside.  That's the way you got to do it.  Like, what's his name in Homeland?  He's not trying to blow up the country.  He's trying to become the vice president and then blow up the country.  Spoiler alert if you haven't seen the show yet, but that's kind of the crux of the  whole thing.  Um, so yeah, it was great to, for, to hear Greg Gutfeld again on the radio.  And then the big comeback to the Opie and Anthony show that everybody's been waiting 
[03:12:00]  for.  They've been asking for the last 365 days, what happened?  Where did he go?  I've been dying to know what he's up to.  Yes.  Ladies and gentlemen, if you missed it, this will be the show that you want to catch on  the replay.  This will be the show that you want to download on the SiriusXM.com on demand feature or app  or however you listen.  This will be the show to save to play for your grandchildren.  Because today was the return of Bobo, the return of Bobo finally to the Opie and Anthony show, 
[03:12:30]  the triumphant return, I should say.  And boy, did he return.  He made it clear that he would like to be on the show again.  And Travis was right.  Travis said, you know, welcome to the phone conversations we have in our office all the  time.  This kid, I don't, don't remember how he ended up getting our office phone number, but Bobo,  he calls our office constantly and he says, you know, it's been a long time since I've 
[03:13:00]  been on the show.  And we go, yeah, it has been.  And he goes, well, I really want to get back on.  And every time the follow-up question is, okay, Bobo, well, what do you want to do?  Well, what do you got for the show?  What do you want to come on and do?  Like for instance, Greg Gutfeld, if he had called up and been like, hey guys, I really  want to be on the show.  We'd be like, what do you want to do on the show?  He'd go, I want to talk about my new book.  We go, okay, Greg Gutfeld, you're in.  That sounds like a good appearance.  And it was.  Bobo, on the other hand, and maybe he doesn't have quite as much to promote. 
[03:13:30]  Maybe he's not quite the cerebral guy that Greg Gutfeld is.  But Bobo, on the other hand, calls up and he just wants to be on the show.  And I can't imagine why.  Because every time he's on the show, somebody comes up to me and says, you know, it's really  not right the way you guys abuse him.  It's not fair to him.  He doesn't know any better.  But then he calls every day that he's not on the show asking when he's going to be on  the show again.  We'll go to area code 347.  You're on after Opie and Anthony live.  Sam.  Yeah, buddy.  You're on the air. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, I'm one of these people that, you know, I work in a gas station.  I've been working here a couple of years.  So sometimes I'm in the book and I'm doing my thing.  I'm either listening to Opie and Anthony or I'm watching something on my eye touch.  And just for whatever reason, like when people pull up, it becomes an easy reason to hate  that because they're interrupting what I'm doing.  So if like a girl pulls up with a BMW on the full surf side and I see her, and once we  connect guys, it's just like instantly like cunt. 
[03:14:30]  You think people...  You know what I do?  Okay.  Like you're saying that you work in a gas station and you'll see women and you'll instantly  think they're cunts?  No, if they pull up on the full surf because they need to interrupt me and I've got to come  out of the booth and help them.  Well, isn't that your job?  Isn't that what you do?  I got an even number, right?  Oh, no.  You could get gas on any pump you want.  Oh, yeah.  I thought it was hot and even.  I wasn't sure.  No, it's not hot and even, sir.  You hear whatever you want.  Is this guy a cunt? 
[03:15:00]  No, you...  I was...  Are you mad at that?  What is this?  Gas station radio?  I can't.  I can't put up with this anymore.  606.  You're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  You're on the air.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, I learned something kind of cool today.  I learned that any topless photo of E-Rock needs to be blurred out because it's offensive.  Well, you can't show titties everywhere.  You know what I mean?  You can't.  We were going to send E-Rock down to the Today Show, but we didn't want an FCC violation  against us.  Gotcha.  All right.  We'll do the job.  I'll talk to you later. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, that was cool.  The Today Show.  It's so weird.  Like, the Today Show decides...  So, they played the clip of when Opie and Anthony sent a woman down.  It was like the year 2000, I think they established.  But they sent this chick down, and she's wearing a WOW sticker, and she goes outside the Today  Show on NBC, and she flashes them titties.  Because that's what WOW is all about.  And when it happened, the Today Show was completely outraged that anything like this could happen.  Like, why would they do this?  This stupid radio prank.  There's no place for this on NBC. 
[03:16:00]  The National Broadcasting Company or Channel or whatever that C stands for.  There's no place for that type of nudity on our channel.  So then you fast forward like 10 years later, and they're just like a little side note as  they're doing a story about nudity in San Francisco.  Hey, you guys remember when there was that girl flashing her titties outside of our studio?  Yeah, you were upset about it.  You're all smiles now?  You bullshitters. 
[03:16:30]  We will go to area code 205.  You're on after Opie and Anthony live.  Yeah, hey Sam.  I'm confused.  Why are we rehashing what happened on Opie and Anthony?  I'm here for my new and original Sam show content.  So we've gotten to the point that the after show is actually getting complaints when we recap after...  It's annoying.  I heard that already.  Let's do something new.  All right.  Let's monkey dance.  All right.  Let's do something new then.  You're right.  I'll dance for you.  I'll dance for you. 
[03:17:00]  That's hilarious.  I used to get shit for it.  Well, I will say...  I don't know where Roland's at.  Because I want to talk to him about how he feels.  Opie came on the show this morning and said...  And I'm trying not to recap the show.  I don't want to upset anybody.  But Opie came on the show this morning and said that Roland needs a show.  Now, the food court, I thought, went well.  But we're now at the point where people are taking his recommendations for restaurants.  And demanding more Roland.  I don't know if he's comfortable with it because he was very scared going into food court, if you remember. 
[03:17:30]  That was the show that was on on Saturday.  Which, by the way, both Roland and E-Rock shows are on demand right now on the SiriusXM website.  You just go and you go in the worst of Opie and Anthony on demand section, whatever it's called.  But you can download the shows that way and listen to them whenever you want.  But I would love to hear what Roland thinks about the fact that Opie wants him on the air regularly.  John in Texas.  John, you're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  The great primetime Sam Roberts.  Yeah. 
[03:18:00]  That's me.  Hey, Carly Rae Jetson won an award.  Since you did actually make her who she is, when is your award coming?  It's amazing to me, John, and thank you for the call.  It's amazing that after all this time, I mean, you talk about original content on After Opie and Anthony Live.  We sat here, Troy Hinson, Troy Kwan, I don't know if you've ever said his real last name on the air.  Troy Kwan and myself sat here and broke Carly Rae Jetson to the masses.  Before us, it just wasn't happening. 
[03:18:30]  It wasn't working for her.  Justin Bieber was trying to push her, and it just wasn't happening.  For whatever reason, she wasn't clicking with the audience.  Rebecca Black, you threw her on YouTube.  She clicked right away.  Thanksgiving girl, phenomenon.  Psy, Gangnam Style.  He's dancing with MC Hammer now, all because of this internet.  Rebecca Black, I mean, Carly Rae Jetson needed a little something else.  She needed radio play.  She needed to get famous the old school way.  She needed to find a young disc jockey that would take a chance on her record, Call Me Maybe, and introduce it to the masses. 
[03:19:00]  And what happened?  After Opie and Anthony Live met the challenge, we played the record for the first time in a major way, let's be honest.  It was here and there before that.  But we played that song, like, nine times on one show.  We got it in all of your heads.  That song wasn't stuck in anybody's head until after Opie and Anthony Live happened.  Now, not only is Carly Rae Jetson not thanking this show when she goes and accepts the award for Best New Artist at the AMA's Sunday night, 
[03:19:30]  we still haven't even gotten her in studio.  We haven't even gotten the chance to talk to Carly Rae Jetson.  Now, I know that she knows this because she's following both me and Troy on Twitter.  So she's heard all your tweets saying, listen, Carly Rae, we all know who's responsible for your fame.  If you could acknowledge it, we would appreciate it.  Be honest to your fans.  But she doesn't do that. 
[03:20:00]  She just sits there, you know, and Justin Bieber thanking the haters.  Get out of here, Justin Bieber.  See, Justin Bieber will thank me, but Carly Rae Jetson won't.  It's re-diculous.  Michael in New Hampshire.  Hey, Sam.  How's it going?  I'm pretty good.  How about you, Michael?  I'm hanging in there.  We're almost Thanksgiving.  I have a question.  The other day, you guys were talking about in the studio about, like, annoying people on Twitter.  Yeah.  Specifically, you talk about that picture you took of yourself, and you're like, yes, you're the only person that ever made the mention of Sideshow Bob. 
[03:20:30]  I remember.  Is that the most annoying thing that you find that people, like, keep Twittering you about and, like, keep retweeting you and stuff like that?  Or is there something else that's more annoying?  Well, I don't know if there's anything quite as repetitive as that.  And people really, like, I'm starting to get tweets now where people search my app mentions, and then they go back and apologize because they didn't realize how unoriginal and overdone the Sideshow Bob comparison is. 
[03:21:00]  Like, yes, I understand.  My hair sticks out in every direction.  I've realized that.  For a long time, it was pulled back.  Now it sticks out in every direction.  This isn't a surprise to me.  It's not news to me.  And so, yes, I understand that there is a visual similarity to Sideshow Bob from the cartoon The Simpsons.  It's been pointed out to me a few times.  I got it.  But still, every time there's a photo of me or a video of me going up, what is that, Sideshow Bob talking to that girl?  No, it's not.  It's me.  I think you know that by now. 
[03:21:30]  Why would Sideshow Bob have the Twitter handle, at Not Sam?  First of all, Sideshow Bob is the color yellow.  Second of all, he wears a green skirt made of leaves.  Third of all, he plays a slide whistle.  Anthony can play a slide whistle.  I have no idea how they're played.  The similarities between me and Sideshow Bob end at the hairdo.  And that's something everybody's got to realize that that joke has happened.  Like, everybody's got to just come to terms with the fact, even though you thought of it and nobody told it to you, 
[03:22:00]  you guys have got to come to terms with the fact that it's been thought of.  Like, a lot of people already thought of it.  So when you're tweeting going like, this will be a good one, it's been done.  I don't even know what the thinking is behind somebody who's like, you know what?  I'm going to respond to Sam's Twitter or anyone's Twitter for that matter with something insulting.  But I'm just busting balls.  I don't know you.  I don't need you busting my balls.  Like, it's never, I've never actually read something that's insulting about me and being like, good one. 
[03:22:30]  I've always been like, like, I always click the name and say, he follows me.  What a fucking idiot this guy is.  Every time.  Especially the Sideshow Bob once.  Especially the Sideshow Bob once.  What's up, Troy?  People that listen to this show, that want to fire insults at us, they use a few words too many, too much.  Like what?  What's the word?  Douche is the word that everybody tweets.  I always find that they tweet whatever Jim Norton says.  Oh, yeah.  Like whatever insults, like AIDS, for instance, is mentioned quite a bit. 
[03:23:00]  Like, I would, it would drive me crazy to be Jim and know that every time I come up with something original.  Everybody steals your humor.  Right.  There's 150,000 fans that are tweeting it out to everybody you know.  Right.  And if they, when they're in their little small towns tweeting what Jim has said or talking to people.  Right.  Using some of the same jokes that don't listen to the show.  It's like, okay, cool.  You're funny.  Oh, that's just a funny joke.  Like, because they don't listen to Jim.  But when you tweet people that work on the show the same jokes.  We work on the show. 
[03:23:30]  Like, we know Jim.  Yeah.  We heard where you got it from.  Yeah.  But douche is the one that I, everybody has to always use the word douche when they tweet me.  As an insult.  They can't think of anything else to say.  Because douche is like an easy one.  Right.  Douche is like something where like, I could just say, well, I don't like Troy.  And I don't know why.  So I just write douche.  Right.  Like, I get douche a lot too.  Because it's just, that's just an easy, without adding any descriptives after it.  Right.  Like, you could explain what makes.  It doesn't really require too much thought.  No.  And then all you do is you take something that they've talked about on the show. 
[03:24:00]  Like, they say, oh, you're a hipster.  So it's like, shut the fuck up, you hipster douche.  And I literally see like 50 tweets that say that exact same thing.  Because Opie and Anthony and Jim have gone to the effort of assessing your personality and what you look like and making judgments on that.  Right.  Once that's done, a lot of the people on Twitter will just be like, oh, that work's done.  I'll just use that judgment then.  And then it can be my opinion too.  Right.  Like, luckily somebody has made an opinion for me and I don't have to use my brain. 
[03:24:30]  But they're completely wasting their time because everybody is saying the same thing.  So I'm not paying attention to any one of them.  Do you block them or just ignore?  Sometimes people will just keep going and I'll just be like, oh, who cares?  Blocked.  Yeah.  Like, I'm tired.  If this is like one insult, I don't give a shit.  Yeah.  That's the same way I am.  Like, for the most part, I don't do a lot of blocking.  But there'll be some, like, I will, like, sometimes click the name and see what else they tweet.  And if, like, I'll see people who literally just start Twitter accounts to bust balls with people who are on this show. 
[03:25:00]  And that's all they do.  Like, I just go through their timeline.  They're going, at Anthony Cumia, underage girl joke.  At OB Radio, whatever.  Shitting on the beach or YouTube joke.  At Jim Norton, whatever.  You know what I mean?  And it's just like, well, I'm going to block them because, like, that's all that they're here for.  So what do you think that is?  They just need some sort of connection with those guys?  I don't know.  Like, we have phones.  We're such an interactive show.  But you know what?  Like, if you do, this is what is crazy to me. 
[03:25:30]  Nobody on this show has ever blocked somebody for being like, good job today.  Or like, hey, that was really funny when you did that.  Like, if you want to establish a connection with somebody on the show that badly, just mention something you appreciated that they did.  And they may even tweet you back, oh, thanks, man.  Yeah.  I've done that.  I've tweeted back, thanks.  Sure.  But I've never tweeted back, like, that really hurt.  I wish I hadn't said that.  That one hurt my feelings.  Yeah.  It's funny to get for people that actually get into Twitter wars with people you don't even know who the fuck they are. 
[03:26:00]  It's just like, you look at this guy, he just looks sad.  Yeah.  Well, that's what I never understood Roland.  Like, the amount of emotion that Roland puts into these Twitter wars.  And the amount, like, people sting Roland when they start tweeting him.  And, like, for me, I'm looking at him like, you're just another scroll.  Yeah, exactly.  You know what I mean?  Like, it's not a big deal.  But there are, like, for some reason.  But that is funny when Roland does it.  I mean, it's funny, but it's dangerous.  Like, he goes way over the top. 
[03:26:30]  What are they going to do?  No one's going to do anything.  No, but it's like, I mean, I don't want the karma of, like, wishing retardation on children.  He's not worried about it.  I don't think he's worried about that.  He doesn't.  Karma doesn't.  I don't think that even, like, I don't think karma is even in Roland's vocabulary whatsoever.  He just, he doesn't know at all.  It just doesn't.  No, it doesn't.  Is that a restaurant?  No.  Okay, no.  I don't understand what you're talking about then.  Yeah.  Like, he knows serendipity, but that's because it's a dessert place.  He doesn't understand the idea of, like, serendipitous things happening. 
[03:27:00]  Right.  He knows that they make great floats and great Sundays.  Yeah.  I think Roland likes a lot of, like, instantaneous gratification.  That's more important.  He's not a spiritual guy.  No, like, you know what I mean?  Like, I got to feel good right now.  Right.  Like, this insult, firing this back at this guy that said something mean about me.  Ah.  Like, I got you, motherfucker.  Yeah.  And then the guy stops and he's like, I won.  Right.  You will have pain.  Oh, good for me.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Which is very definition of bad karma. 
[03:27:30]  But that doesn't matter.  It doesn't.  And you don't even know the definition.  No.  Kevin in, according to Sal, Buston.  B-O-U-S-T-E-N.  Is that Houston or Boston?  Both.  Both.  A little something from both.  Mr. Across the Country Coastal Kevin.  South of work.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  You know, one of the things that you can always tell with these listeners that, like, the Jim 
[03:28:00]  Norton, you know, flipping a puddle of age joke.  He hasn't used that joke in probably seven years.  Because he, even he knows, it's like, okay, that's been done.  Like, Jim, if you watch his stuff now, he's developed and he's moved on and he's gotten, you know, he's talking about things that are relevant today and he's actually, he's grown as a human being and as a performer.  Whereas these guys are like, huh, puddle of AIDS.  I get it because AIDS is bad and a puddle is like a puddle. 
[03:28:30]  Right.  And it's the same people that call in and, you know, happy birthday, Jimmy.  It's, I mean, just stop already.  Knock it off.  It's so funny.  You know what's funny to me?  When people call up and say, good morning, bu-bu-bu-boys.  And you always hear Opie, Anthony, and Jim go, ugh.  Like, every time they're like, ugh.  All right, punch it out.  Have a good day, guys.  All right, thanks, buddy.  And he just did it.  Wow, yeah.  And he just did punch it out.  Punch it out.  It's hard.  And it's like, dude, where do you fucking, where do you draw the line? 
[03:29:00]  And the other thing is, what's the other one that everyone always says?  Oh, yeah, long-time listener, first-time caller.  Who cares?  No, Sal.  Who fucking cares?  You have taken, in recent history, probably the most shit.  Because what happens is, whoever's taking shit on the show at the time takes the shit  from the audience, which makes sense.  I mean, the audience listens because they like the show, and that's just where they're  going to go.  You take a lot of shit on Twitter?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, you don't even, what's your Twitter name? 
[03:29:30]  I'm Sal617 on Twitter.  Yeah, I guess we should clear that up.  I'm not Sam.  You're Troy Kwan.  Yep.  Q-U-A-N.  And you're Sal617.  Yes.  So, you take a lot of shit.  Yeah.  Some of it's really funny, though.  You like it.  I will admit, some of it's amusing, some of it's retarded.  All right.  Well, then keep it coming.  We'll play a game called Make Sal Laugh, and you send your most horrible, nasty tweets.  Or hurt Sal's feelings.  Or hurt Sal's feelings.  Yeah.  Because it's not working.  So, you guys need to try a little harder. 
[03:30:00]  Right.  Either try harder, or if you just want to make Sal laugh, because you like him, now you  know what makes him laugh, is if you send terrible things about him.  So, either way, just the worst possible things you can imagine.  Yeah.  I just, you can't let it affect you personally.  It's because I don't know these people.  I've never seen them, you know.  Do you block people?  Like, I will say, any angry panda thing gets blocked.  But if it's funny, I'll usually...  Is that what happens when you make the panda angry, he blocks you?  Yeah.  That's true.  And then, but yeah, like sometimes they actually have a good take on it. 
[03:30:30]  So, that's when I'll respond, or I'll retweet, or something like that.  What's a good take to have?  Your production stinks.  Yeah.  That's the take, right?  Yeah.  Bob in Texas.  This show is kind of, I have a cult-like following, and we can all tend to be, well, fat, unoriginal.  You know, when they call in an attack, we go after the attack rather robotic-like.  Yeah, but I mean, I don't mind the attacks so much.  Like, the attacks are always funny, because you just see the same things over and over  again on somebody's Facebook page. 
[03:31:00]  Like, I like the attacks.  I'm more talking about just the day-to-day, like, this is what you're spending your day  doing.  Like, it's not, like, when we're like, okay, we got this Facebook page, and everybody  has sort of the ONA community is going and attacking that Facebook page.  Like, we can all laugh at that.  Like, that always ends up being funny.  I always end up feeling somewhat guilty.  But it is always funny when people band together, and they start posting the pictures and everything.  I mean more just, like, just spending your days doing it.  Like, just, I'm tweeting something like, hey, I just posted a new video on YouTube. 
[03:31:30]  And then somebody's like, oh, you're Sideshow Bob with AIDS.  And I go, all right, I don't know what that has to do with anything.  But I'm not laughing, because I've heard it before.  It's just easy for us to all be a bit unoriginal, though, because this show is almost, it's like  a damn religion for me.  I've been listening to this fucking thing forever, and I just find myself...  I respect that, because, yeah, before I got here, I mean, I was listening to this show  since high school.  But, I mean, I'm telling you, if you want, like, you could just be like, hey, you're on 
[03:32:00]  our team.  This is what we like.  And then when we attack, we attack, you know?  I just find myself easily slipping into the insults that I hear on the show.  Do you do it in your personal life, too?  Oh, yeah.  You should have seen...  People...  And in Texas, people look at me like I'm from fucking Mars.  And I love it, you know?  It's funny, because Jess, my wife, gets so frustrated whenever anybody makes a show reference, because 
[03:32:30]  it's been her...  Obviously, because she's not a fan of the show.  Like, she didn't listen.  She had no idea what Opie and Anthony was before she met me.  And it's just inundated her life for seven or eight years, however long it's been.  Like, it's been all-encompassing, because I work so much.  And so she goes crazy whenever anybody in her personal life...  Like, at our wedding, our DJ happened to be a big fan of the show.  And we didn't know until a week before the wedding.  Like, we didn't get a deal.  We didn't hire him because he was a fan. 
[03:33:00]  But he just happened to be a fan of the show.  And, like, we told him...  Like, to the point where, a week before the wedding, we're having, like, the last sort  of music meeting with him.  And I sculpted the music at that wedding.  I wanted to make sure the music was right for the whole crowd.  And music is important at a wedding.  It gets the mood.  And, you know, you also have to remember, like, you got this one table with, like, Troy  and Roland and E-Rock and Monica and all these people.  And this is, like, the young table, right?  So they're going to want a certain music. 
[03:33:30]  But then you got five tables of old people.  So you got to make sure everybody's satisfied.  So I'm talking to the DJ about all the music I want played.  And Jess is there.  We're Skyping or whatever.  And the DJ goes...  And, you know, I was just thinking, just a shot in the dark, you know, because I just  found out where you work.  Do you want any, like, Drew Boogie remixes thrown in there?  And I was like, I guess I'll leave work at work this time.  You know, I love Drew Boogie.  I love what he does.  It's hilarious.  But I don't think I need it at my wedding.  At my wedding day.  We'll probably leave work here.  And then I'll go get married. 
[03:34:00]  And then he goes, oh, okay, I get it.  I get it.  And Jess goes, no, really.  Like, I really don't want any show references.  He goes, okay, yeah, I got it.  She goes, like, professional.  And he goes, right.  No problem, Jess.  I'm on top of this motherfucker.  So we get to the wedding.  And I don't know if you caught this, Troy, when you were sitting there.  But right before we walk out.  So we're standing right outside.  We're about to be introduced into the reception.  Jess hears the DJ.  And I don't know if he thought he could slip it in because we weren't in the room yet.  But it's on a microphone.  It's a PA system. 
[03:34:30]  We're going to hear.  The DJ goes, I did want to say one thing.  Before we introduce the bride and groom, happy birthday, little Jimmy.  And Jess looks at me.  She goes, did he just say happy birthday, little Jimmy?  And I go, just relax.  Just relax.  We're about to be introduced.  Just be cool.  I swear that'll be it.  She was about to flip out right before we walked in.  Yeah.  But then, and then that was it.  Yeah.  I did hear that, actually.  And I thought to myself, I was like, oh, dude, really?  Like, you don't want that here.  Yeah, like, why would you do that? 
[03:35:00]  Like, I love the show.  I love Jim.  Sure.  Love Opie and Anthony.  Love all the references.  But I don't need that.  The temptation was just killing him.  He was.  He was waiting for the right spot.  I bet you had butterflies doing it.  He was so nervous.  And he's like, I got to do this.  I got to do this.  All right.  All right.  Sam seemed cool, but Jess seemed a little like she was very particular about this.  But they're not in the room right now.  I haven't introduced them yet.  So technically, this is my room right now.  Yeah.  They're not in here yet.  Before the bride and groom get introduced, this is my audience, right? 
[03:35:30]  So why do you think that happens?  Like, do you think he's just like, I have to show off for these guys?  Or do you think I want them to talk about this the next morning on a Monday?  Well, I don't know.  I think it's just like, it's just like we are, like, we're very close to the show.  So we don't really relate to it the same way.  Because people, this is a huge show.  And people love it the same way you love your favorite band or whatever.  Like, that's how I felt about the show before I got here.  When I was in high school and stuff, like, I listened to the show religiously. 
[03:36:00]  And I came to high school every day with my friend who also listened to the show.  And all we did was talk about the show.  We did jokes from the show.  And we sang songs from the show.  And we did all that.  So I understand it.  I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, by the way.  But I think it's just like, like, you know, when your favorite band's around, you want  to acknowledge that you're, you want them to know you're a fan.  And it's tough to do, to just be able to go up to them and be like, hey, I really like  what you do.  Like, you want them to know you're one of the next level. 
[03:36:30]  Like, I'm really a fan.  Yeah, but don't people realize that's creepy?  Like, don't they realize that it's a lot cooler to just, for that person, for Jim or  Opie and Anthony, just to be like, dude, I've been listening to you for years, man.  I'm just, it's an honor for you to be here.  It's a hard line to draw.  And honestly, like, playing devil's advocate for this guy, like, how many people that he  thinks are cool, like Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton, do you think show up at weddings  in Bumblefuck, Connecticut?  I don't even remember the name of the town.  Middletown, Connecticut.  There aren't a lot of celebrity weddings going on up there. 
[03:37:00]  So when Norton and Opie and Anthony roll in, you know what I mean?  He's like, oh, shit.  You could just be cooler to shake their hand and then try to get a picture later.  Yes, it would be cooler.  And I would have no problem with that.  Right.  But, you know, sometimes you get excited.  Sure.  You know, you're a fan.  Yeah.  I get it.  A lot of people are tweeting me nice things, by the way.  They are?  Yeah.  But I do love the listeners because they're all just like fake nice things.  Yeah.  Really like you, Troy.  Really appreciate what you do.  Just don't be an asshole. 
[03:37:30]  Anthony in New Orleans.  Good morning, Sammy, the king of the after show.  What's up, buddy?  Troy, I want to stop all the hating here.  I actually want to thank you for my autographed Jesse James book.  And I was also wondering, do you have any more wonderful things to give away?  What do I have?  I don't know if I have anything right now.  Actually, I'm going to hang up on Anthony because Joker is on the phone.  And Joker got all pissed at me.  And this is a legitimate tweet. 
[03:38:00]  I read your tweet, Joker.  He got all pissed at me because the day we were giving away a Call of Dewey game, I think,  I didn't answer his call.  And he was like, what the fuck?  And I'm just like, Joker, I can't take your call every time.  Like, I went to a call and it wasn't yours.  Right.  Joker's gotten stuff before, too.  Well, this is his problem.  Joker, explain.  Yeah, this is it.  Hey, Troy.  First off, let me claim, I am an Uber fan, Sam.  I have followed you since the day you showed up on that show.  You're the man.  Every show you have. 
[03:38:30]  Every show.  My problem is, Troy, you had a signed Motley Crue, Nikki Six book.  You have to understand that back in the early 70s and 80s, my brother and I opened for Motley  Crue all over Southern California.  We opened for Van Halen.  We opened for White Snake.  We opened for all the big bands out there of the time.  Now, let me ask you this.  Let me ask you this, Joker.  Do you now, are you bitter that nothing happened with your band or are you happy to have the 
[03:39:00]  life experience?  Oh, no, it's great.  Oh, okay.  It was wonderful.  It was the best time of our life.  We were young.  We were getting high constantly, party every day.  Fucking lots of bitches.  I would imagine.  Oh, it was awesome.  You ever see Tommy Lee's dick in person?  No.  I've heard it's very big.  I've seen the video.  It seems to be.  Were you ever, when you watched the video, were you like, oh, fuck, I could have seen that  shit in person?  What?  Yeah.  I could have hardly wait to touch it. 
[03:39:30]  Or like, that could have been me.  Why is that not me?  Oh, yeah.  I could have been honking the boat with it.  Do you have a Tommy Lee dick, Joker?  Well, it's not a Tommy Lee, but it's definitely impressive.  You could have been fucking Pamela Anderson on that boat.  Oh, then I could have had all the fucking diseases.  You could have been getting that hand job while they were driving wherever they were  driving to.  Anyways.  And then it could have been Joker Goes to College, The Failure of a Reality Show. 
[03:40:00]  Anyway, Joker.  We went off on a tangent somewhere.  Yeah.  We had that book.  Tori was sending it to me.  Somewhere along the line, it didn't show up.  What?  I don't know why.  I don't know how.  And Sam, I talked to you on your Sunday show.  That's right.  And your instructions to me were, hey, call me on the after show.  We'll take care of you.  So that's why you got a phone call about the game.  Yeah.  Because, hey, that's great for my grandson.  That's wonderful for my grandson.  And according to you, all I had to do was call you. 
[03:40:30]  I don't know why that book would have never.  It was sent out.  It was definitely sent.  We send everything.  All right.  I know.  I'm going to, Joker, I'm going to put you on hold.  Sal, take down Joker's information.  And we'll send you something or other.  Okay, Joker, we'll send you something good.  All right.  Sounds cool, brother.  All right, buddy.  Thanks.  See, Joker's a good guy.  He is.  I like the people who call up regularly and contribute and everything.  And I don't like the people whose names I just see on Twitter.  Like when I see some, like I met somebody when we went to, I worked one of Jim's comedy 
[03:41:00]  shows because Club City Kenny couldn't go.  So I worked the merch booth and, you know, timed him and everything.  And I went up to, like somebody came up to me and he goes, Sam, you're a big, I'm a big  fan of yours.  I'm always tweeting you stuff and trying to get you to block me and you never have.  And like in my head, I'm just going, this is a fucking asshole right here.  Yeah.  Like what?  What?  Like that's like, what type of fan are you?  This is an asshole in front of me.  Yeah.  I was DJing once and this guy came up to me and he said, he's like, oh, hey, what's 
[03:41:30]  up, man?  Big fan of the show.  I was like, oh, cool.  What's up?  He's like, can I take a picture?  I was like, yeah, fine.  And then he was like, oh, you blocked me.  I was just kidding around with you.  I said something and you blocked me.  I was like, well, don't say stupid shit.  Right.  I'm not going to unblock you.  And he was like, yeah, can you unblock me?  I was like, I don't know who your name is.  And he tried to tell me.  I was like, I won't remember that.  Yeah.  That's it's done.  Yeah.  Some guy who works here like a couple of weeks ago was like, oh, Sam, I was listening  to the show today.  It was really funny.  I go, oh, cool.  Thanks.  And he goes, yeah, when they were making fun of you, I go, oh, cool. 
[03:42:00]  Thanks.  And he goes, yeah, I love when they make fun of you.  And I'm like, are you trying to start shit or are you just saying that?  If you just punch him in the face, I should have like, what the fuck spit on him?  Fuck you, asshole.  Yeah, exactly.  You know what I love when you get kicked in the fucking gut?  How about that?  How about we both end up happy today?  Um, Bobo?  Oh, geez.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a sweet thing, you guys.  It's a full.  Now, were you feeling triumphant with your big return to the show today?  Yeah, I was kind of feeling sort of triumphant when I called in. 
[03:42:30]  That's cool.  That's awesome.  I just want to get that information out there.  Dave in Connecticut.  Hey, Sam.  How you doing, buddy?  Good, buddy.  Hey, I don't know if you've caught this.  Um, there's a couple of show references, since you're talking about show references, on WWE over the last couple of weeks.  Um, the first one was probably, I think it was like three or four weeks ago, with JBL and Josh were going back and forth trading insults on SmackDown. 
[03:43:00]  And Josh says, or JBL says to Josh, yeah, well, you called 911 for a flat tire.  I did hear that, and I saw some stuff on Twitter about that.  Uh, Josh Matthews, the commentator for SmackDown, he got made fun of for calling 911 to change a tire.  And I'm friends with him, so I texted him.  And I go, like, what the fuck?  Did you hear that on the show, or did that actually happen?  And he goes, no, dude, I called 911 to change the tire.  Yeah, so now, I got, whenever, when Josh is back in town, I gotta get him on this show, so we could just do the 911 tire show. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, that would be a great show.  Who else has done that?  Nobody else has done that.  I, like, I got so much shit for that, because everybody was like, who the fuck would do that?  This dude on TV, on wrestling, he did it.  And if you remember, JBL was on the Opie and Anthony show just before he went to do his, you know, hike of Kilimanjaro.  That's right.  And you guys talked about, you know, Opie telling you, yeah, well, you called 911 for a flat tire. 
[03:44:00]  So, you know he picked it up there.  Maybe he did.  Thank you, Dave.  And there was one other one.  Oh, yeah, go ahead.  I'm sorry.  There was one other one.  I think it was, like, two weeks ago on Raw.  And, uh, Mick Foley was talking to The Miz, and he walked up to him and said, oh, by the way, Amy Schumer says hi.  We played that on the air.  That was funny.  Oh, I missed that.  I'm sorry.  I texted Mick after that, and he said that was absolutely improvised.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He just added it in at the end.  That was very funny.  Okay.  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  Take care. 
[03:44:30]  All right.  Dolph Ziggler is a wrestler.  He fucked Amy Schumer.  He dated her, but they also had sexual relations, for sure.  She talked about it on Howard's show.  So, um, I did want to play this.  Yesterday, Opie played his new thing.  It's up on YouTube, on YouTube slash Opie Radio.  Uh, his prank call that he did for Dr. Steve, because Dr. Steve, and if you're listening, you could call up if you want to.  But Dr. Steve has been doing this weird thing.  I played it on my birthday.  He's been calling me and leaving me voicemails in character. 
[03:45:00]  And I don't know what the character is, but it freaks me out that a doctor who prescribes people medication is calling people in character.  Um, but this was, let's play this first.  This was, Dr. Steve, yeah, yeah, we'll play it from here in a second.  Dr. Steve does a show here on the channel called Weird Medicine.  It's, it's a call-in medical show.  It's pre-taped, but he tweets out the phone number when they're taping it, so you can call in and do live calls.  I think Dr. Steve is probably his Twitter.  But this was Opie, and you could go to YouTube and watch it, Opie Radio on YouTube. 
[03:45:30]  This is Opie prank calling Dr. Steve.  Ronnie from Charlotte, 516 area code.  What's up, bro?  Big fan about you, Steve.  I lost a call in my job.  I was a big fan of this show.  Thanks, dude.  I have a question.  Okay.  I have a rat that goes from my wrist all the way up to my elbow. 
[03:46:00]  Okay.  And I try to figure out what it is.  Okay.  And a friend of mine said that it could be a form of sickle.  And I find that weird.  Okay.  I haven't had sex in quite a long time because of my medical condition.  Yeah.  And I'm trying to figure out what the rest is and if it's possible that it's some kind of sickle.  Okay.  Now, what's your underlying medical condition? 
[03:46:30]  You're having some difficulty breathing, so what's up with that?  It's not that I have difficulty breathing.  It's a loss of a corner of my jaw.  Okay.  Okay.  And it's just difficult to talk.  Okay.  No problem, man.  I can breathe far.  I can breathe far.  It's good that I have to hold my jaw in some way.  Yes.  So I can talk.  Okay.  So I don't want to breathe. 
[03:47:00]  Because it is quite painful.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, don't talk any more than you have to, bro.  Here's the thing about syphilis.  Let's talk about it.  But I really want to go to this right here.  Because, like I said, someone says it could be a form of sickle.  Right.  But I haven't had sex in quarantine all the time.  I mean, we've all heard if you get syphilis from a pregnancy.  So I'm wondering if it's possible that I got this rash and it is syphilis without having sex. 
[03:47:30]  Yes.  Okay.  Here's the story.  Syphilis can have late manifestations.  So syphilis is like Lyme disease.  You get an early rash, which is called a chancre, which is usually a painless nodule on the penis or vagina that will divide and divide again.  So it will be one nodule, then it will be two, and then four, and then it will just go away.  And then you have this latency period, just like you do with Lyme disease as well. 
[03:48:00]  And then you have the tertiary phase where you can get a rash, and you can also get what's called neurosyphilis,  which is where the bacteria starts invading the central nervous system.  Now, and no one can tell just by looking at it.  I mean, you know, they've got poor Ronnie out there, and he's already having a rough time.  And then some guy goes, dude, that rash on your elbow could be syphilis.  You know, come on.  You've just got to go to your doctor and let them do a test.  It's a real simple blood test. 
[03:48:30]  And if the blood test is negative, you don't have syphilis.  And then they can go ahead and treat whatever the underlying problem actually is.  My friends say that it could be related to the fact that they take a lot of baths.  Now, your friends, your friends.  Syphilis, all friends.  Okay.  Stop listening to your friends.  Yeah, stop listening to your friends.  Just ask us.  Just stop listening to them.  Go to your doctor and get checked out.  And let me know what they say, okay?  No, I mean, he's not emotional. 
[03:49:00]  He actually said that it is possible that you could dry out your skin by taking too many baths.  But that could have somehow caused a rash.  That could cause a rash, but it's not going to cause syphilis.  So, anyway.  All right, man.  Hey, email me.  And if you want to continue this conversation at weirdmedicineatriotcast.com, and we'll go from there.  And I really appreciate you calling, Ronnie.  You're a good man.  I'm thinking he was for real. 
[03:49:30]  I do.  I sort of get, but it's close.  At first, I was like, I'm so, you know, it's that fine line between is somebody messing with you or are they for real?  I think Ronnie was for real.  There was no fine line there, Dr. Steve.  It was Opie, and he called you up asking if he had syphilis or if he was taking too many baths.  There was no fine line.  Although Opie did a good job disguising his voice.  I mean, you'd think that after Ronnie, where did he say he was from? 
[03:50:00]  It was like Charlotte, or I missed the beginning part.  But when Dr. Steve, he said like Charlotte or something, but when Dr. Steve picked him up, it was area code 516, right?  Yeah.  Long Island.  Right.  The area code doesn't match up at all.  And he just kept talking.  Ronnie kept talking.  I'll pick up the hotline, Sal.  Hello.  Yeah, it's Kenny.  Kenny, how are you?  Hi, Sam.  I just want to tell you and Troy how much I'm enjoying the after show today.  Kevin from Connecticut tweeted me, and he wrote, you have sideshow AIDS. 
[03:50:30]  Which is funny.  No, no, no.  No, he doesn't know.  No, he doesn't, does he?  You know, you just mentioned Dr. Steve, and there's another thing that was annoying about him lately.  What's that?  Well, he posts on Facebook.  He's going to record my...  Kenny, your phone's crapping out.  If you've got to get a Facebook plug out, get it out now.  Oh, he's gone.  Club Soda Kenny on Facebook. 
[03:51:00]  Thank God for you.  I'll just get out there, yeah.  Thank God for you.  So then...  Thank God for Kenny.  Like two days ago, and I never called him back.  Dr. Steve, because he, like, it was on Friday.  Dr. Steve called me, and he left me a voicemail.  I go, oh, man, what's Dr. Steve want?  And this was the voicemail that was left for me.  Well, I heard you got to try to use some sweet potato pie.  We call that shoot fly pie. 
[03:51:30]  It's right good.  It's tasty.  You got to be careful, though, because it makes your blood sugar go off.  You know what that pie will do to you?  And if you don't brush your teeth afterwards, you will.  You might have to get you a cavity filled.  The fuck is he doing?  I hope you're all right, though.  When he's...  That old shit, Paul, he's a vegan. 
[03:52:00]  I don't even know what he's talking about.  He can't hardly walk no more, because he's a plant, but he sure does make good pie.  And I know that y'all appreciated all the hard work that went into that.  I know...  He's just, he's talking about the pie that he sent.  You think he just does stuff like that to, because he knows he'll talk about it?  You think so?  If you don't shit yourself, well, if you do, don't fall back in it.  I don't even know what he's talking about.  There's a minute left in the void.  There's still another minute to go on it. 
[03:52:30]  You think he's just doing it because it's just a cry for attention?  I think he's just like, he'll know that you'll talk about it on the show.  It'd be funny if he was doing all sorts of weird pharmaceuticals and starts doing that.  I would think that was fucking hysterical.  But I don't even understand the character at all.  At all.  I don't think he does.  Is he just doing a voice, and then he's talking about shitting himself?  Yeah, and he just tries to do, like, weird shit.  Dr. Steve's the man, so...  He is great, and his show is awesome.  Yeah.  I told this to Dr. Steve, though.  His show is awesome when you're taking phone calls.  Not when you're leaving weird character voicemails for me. 
[03:53:00]  Hotline.  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  Yeah, saying what I was saying like that.  That Dr. Steve is annoying.  Yeah.  Like when he wants people to call into his show, he'll post a number like 1-800-BIG-TITS.  Right.  You like that or you don't like that?  No, I don't like that.  Why?  It's very immature.  Let him just post a number.  Well, don't you think having a number like that will stick in people's heads a little more?  No. 
[03:53:30]  No.  It's a turn-off.  He says...  It's not a right thing.  This is coming from Kenning.  I don't go for that.  When did you become Mr. Class?  Listen, like you said, he's a medical doctor.  He is.  Exactly.  And the other thing I want to mention is Troy's mixtape.  The latest mixtape, Troy, is terrific.  Oh, thank you.  All right, Kenny.  I got to go.  Sam, and you know, your podcasts are good also. 
[03:54:00]  Oh, thank you very much.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  All right, like tomorrow?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It'll be tomorrow.  I had to hang up on him.  I like that you're now aggressive with Kenny and his phone calls.  Because for a while there, he would just try to see how long he could be on the phone with you.  Well, he's just...  He never stops.  He called me on my phone last night, like while I was at home.  It was the longest ten minutes of my life.  Sometimes I love when Kenny calls.  Sometimes I'm really in the mood for it. 
[03:54:30]  And there's other times that I'm just like, I can't do this right now.  Because he called me, and I missed a call.  And he didn't leave a voicemail, so I was like, fuck it.  And then he called back later in the afternoon.  He's like, Sam, you didn't call me back.  And I go, oh, yeah, I'm sorry.  What's up?  And he goes, well, I wanted to talk to you about the AMAs.  It's like the American Music Awards?  Yeah.  I mean, I didn't watch them.  I just read about them.  You didn't see Kesha?  No.  Justin Bieber?  No.  Rihanna?  No, I didn't see any of these people.  And it just goes on and on.  He's talking about nothing for ten minutes.  I finally had to be like, all right, buddy. 
[03:55:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Nice talking to you.  I love Kenny, but I think he's a little lonely sometimes.  I think so, too.  He's got a lonely life.  Listen.  Can I say something real quick?  Yes, you can.  Tomorrow, big party at 675 Bar.  It's the Thanksgiving Eve party, 675 Bar, 13th and Hudson here in New York City.  Come out.  I'm DJing.  That's the night to go out, right?  They say it's the best night of the year, and tomorrow's going to be insane.  And you've got your DJ gig going at 675 Bar.  It's a lot of fun.
