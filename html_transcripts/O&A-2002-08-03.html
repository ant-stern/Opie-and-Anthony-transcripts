<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment featuring Howard Berg, the self-proclaimed 1990 Guinness World Record holder for fastest reader.  Berg demonstrated his speed-reading and memory techniques, punctuated by attempts at Woody Allen and Joe Pesci impressions, though the demonstration was hampered by microphone issues.  This was followed by a phone call with Mike Tyson, whose conversation was characterized by profane and rambling comments on homosexuality, graphic sexual descriptions, and bizarre anecdotes.  The hosts engaged with Tyson's offensive statements and jokes.

Next, the show featured interviews with Kelly Osbourne and Shavo Odadjian of System of a Down. The conversation with Osbourne initially focused on her experience with *The Osbournes*, her discomfort with the show's portrayal of her family, and her music video for "Papa Don't Preach."  The hosts and Jim Norton frequently interrupted with jokes and sexually suggestive comments targeting Jack Osbourne and the Osbourne family's sex life. Odadjian's contributions were minimal during this chaotic segment.  A call from "Wheelchair Fred" followed, detailing a sexual encounter from a personal ad and leading to further sexually explicit humor and jokes at Fred's expense.  The hosts also made plans for Fred to attend a party at the Sam Adams Brewery.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about the cryogenic freezing of Ted Williams' remains, which devolved into a humorous auction of deceased sports figures' body parts (Ted Williams' head, Mickey Mantle's liver, Lou Gehrig's lymph nodes).  This led into a phone call with Andrew Dice Clay, who claimed to be at Ground Zero and boasted about receiving an NYPD hat from a police lieutenant. The hosts attempted to arrange a celebrity boxing match between Dice Clay and Barry Williams (Greg Brady), who was also on the line, potentially brokering a TV deal for Dice. Christopher Titus was present in the studio during this section.

The Andrew Dice Clay call continued, with the hosts expressing frustration at his attempts to claim credit for his work at Ground Zero. Dice's responses became increasingly erratic and nonsensical, rambling through a series of historical tragedies and inserting the phrase "I got a hat" repeatedly.  His conversation with the hosts escalated into angry exchanges.  Barry Williams remained on the line attempting to navigate this situation.  Dice eventually transitioned into a fictional "Quantum Dice" persona, a time-traveling character correcting historical injustices.  Christopher Titus observed this breakdown with the hosts, who displayed a mixture of disbelief, amusement, and concern.  The show concluded with promotion of the "Vote for Boobs" contest and mentions of upcoming guests. Throughout the broadcast, the hosts mentioned a "WOW" contest running on the show's website.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Don't go to CNN for dick jokes, but don't come here for the news.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I like it when this show's dirty.  Here, check it out, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Colin Quinn's downstairs, he's making his way up to the studio.  Great. When he gets here, we got everybody. 
[00:00:30]  Also, we got the speed reader outside.  I was, yeah, just talking to him a little bit.  Excuse me, the world's fastest reader.  He says, I'm being corrected.  Opie, he says he's going to teach us how to speed read.  How about that?  How about that?  How about that?  And get Stinky in here.  Hi.  Hi.  Stinky came running in during commercials.  Stinky, what did the world's fastest reader say to you? 
[00:01:00]  He can't hear out there, can he?  No.  Okay, what did he say?  About Woody Allen?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He wanted to set up a joke between you and him and ask him, what was it?  Do you sound like Woody Allen?  Oh, so I'm supposed to say, hey, wow, you sound just like Woody Allen, and then he's going  to have a witty comeback?  Yeah.  Okay.  Screw it up and say, wow, you sound just like Steve Allen.  Okay.  And have him, like, totally go, no, it's Woody Harrelson.  Woody Harrelson.  Yeah, yeah, do that. 
[00:01:30]  You sound just like Woody Harrelson.  No, no.  Yeah, he looks like, yeah, Stinky.  Who does he look like?  Jimmy James from Office Space.  Right, yeah, we're going to need that stapler, yeah.  Is that any company?  Were you talking to him outside?  He's a nice guy.  Yeah, he's from Dallas, Texas, and he's a speed reader.  Which in Dallas is four words a minute. 
[00:02:00]  I never thought of it that way.  You're right.  You want to talk to him real fast?  Get it?  Oh, real fast.  I get it.  You want to bring him in?  He's taking his time.  He can make up for lost time.  He doesn't have to come running in here.  Justin from Boston says, let's see if we can make this the world's fastest interview.  All right, we can do that.  Can he teach us information retention, too? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, because you can read fast, but if you don't comprehend it.  Oh, my God.  You're a reader?  You certainly look like one.  Doesn't he look like Bill Shatner?  Do you need a headphone or something, sweetie?  Like Shatner now, you know.  You're a stereotypical reader.  The fastest reader in the world is in the Guinness World Record Book in 1990.  It's the Guinness Book of World Records, by the way.  Come on, you're not even the latest guy.  Well, you don't hold the title right now.  You held it in 1990. 
[00:03:00]  What year, Angel?  That was the only year they ran speed reading.  Love you.  Secrets to a bigger brain exposed?  Hold on.  Is this some kind of a cream you rub on your brain to make it bigger?  Because we'd sell it here if it was for your schlong.  Did you hear what he said, though?  No.  They only ran the competition in 1990 and haven't since?  No.  Why not?  Why?  Well, the old editor told me that they want to sell the book every year and they change  the categories or else it would be like a dictionary and basically be buying the same book every  year.  Yeah.  I'm probably afraid that people would buy it and read through it real quick. 
[00:03:30]  That too.  Hey, you sound a little bit like Woody Harrelson.  Actually, it's Woody Allen.  Sun Yi, please be quiet.  Daddy's on the air.  Oh!  Wait, what did you say?  Sun Yi, please be quiet.  Daddy's on the air.  Ah, that sounds just like him.  That sounds just like him.  Unfortunately, I don't sound like Richard Burton, but you make a living here.  Yeah.  Let's hear a little more Woody Allen.  Well, you don't sound like Richard Voss. 
[00:04:00]  I'll go on the rip.  Do you get it?  I think he does.  No, well, material's a little stronger.  I got a book.  Actually, you might tell from my accent I'm from Dallas.  Dallas?  Dallas.  I've been telling them I'm French-Canadian.  They're not too big on New Yorkers.  You don't have a Dallas accent.  Is that another joke, sir?  I'm from Brooklyn originally.  40 years in Brooklyn.  Oh, Brooklyn.  Absolutely.  Well, there you go.  That's where you learn to read, right?  Absolutely.  Did you get beat up a lot in Brooklyn?  Yes, I did.  You did. 
[00:04:30]  What a surprise there, huh?  Remember the movie Goodfellows, the Joe Pesci character?  Oh, Goodfellows was great.  The guy he played went to high school with me.  It was a wonderful school.  The guy he played went to high school with you.  Tommy.  Oh, okay.  That's right.  The real Tommy.  Hey, Tommy, huh?  Yeah.  Very cool.  Great school.  Here you're reading in the weeds?  Here you're reading?  See, he was just doing Joe Pesci.  Am I your personal reader?  I threw those books out, Henry.  Do I amuse you?  We needed those books. 
[00:05:00]  And he's doing a little Pesci for us.  Oh, was it?  Yeah.  Mr. Reader, go ahead.  A little Pesci?  Yeah.  Am I your personal reader?  Is that Woody Harrelson again?  Woody Allen.  Oh, Woody Allen.  I keep mixing that up for some reason.  I think Woody Harrelson's the pothead.  Right.  Exactly.  Right.  You're cracking Opie up.  This guy's a card.  I know.  Regular card.  What a cut up.  Ace of spades. 
[00:05:30]  Whatever card, pick one.  Two of diamonds.  These are death cards.  Let Charlie know who reads faster.  I used to teach high school here in New York.  Oh, you did?  Where?  Where?  Well, you should say, what did I teach?  What did you teach?  Morons.  Oh.  Calm down.  I know.  It's, you know.  Hey, I'm trying to work with you guys.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Your stuff is a little too edgy for us.  They call you Speedy?  Over the top. 
[00:06:00]  Over the top.  This is Howard Speedyberg.  They call you Speedy?  That's correct.  They call me Speedy for different reasons.  You know what that means.  Yeah.  You know what that means.  Yeah.  He writes fast.  I do.  So, Howie.  That's me.  When did you know that you had this talent for speed reading?  Actually, I went to college here in New York.  I went to SUNY Binghamton.  Yeah.  Upstate.  And I majored in biology.  My last year of college, I got very interested in the brain. 
[00:06:30]  And I decided to major in psych.  But I hadn't taken any courses.  I had to take a four-year program in one year.  So, I've been taking six science courses at once.  Oh.  And they said, no way.  You only have a B- average.  Frankly, you're not smart enough.  And that's what I thought about.  They never taught me how to learn in school.  I think we've all had that same experience.  They throw a lot of information at you and never show you why.  You can remember the words that I shot the sheriff.  You don't even want to.  Then you read a book for work or school and 15 minutes later, it's gone.  So, I started learning how to learn, finish the four-year program in a year. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, yeah.  And then I've been teaching this to other people.  And I find that other people can learn quickly, too.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  We have a school here in Dallas.  Hold on.  You obviously weren't in a fraternity, right?  You're right.  Actually, I went into swimming.  See, because we all just cheated.  We just found the tests in dumpsters and stuff.  There's another way to do it.  We got these kids in Dallas.  This 13-year-old just graduated high school.  He's going into a four-year college, choosing my program.  You were in a fraternity?  Was it called Caporita Booker? 
[00:07:30]  That's a hot one.  That's a hoot.  Now, you could teach anybody how to read quickly and remember.  And remember.  In fact, on the air, if we could get a volunteer, I could have them speak.  Oh, okay.  Okay, let's go.  Oh, boy, isn't Francine here today.  And we'll give them a free reading program as a guest.  All right, so you need a volunteer?  And we'll give them a reading program, one of the mega reading programs, as a gift for being able to become a genius. 
[00:08:00]  Well, sir, we have a person outside the studio.  He came by to get some autographs from the gang and a couple pictures.  He's a faithful listener of the show, and he stopped by to say hi.  You want to bring him in?  That sounds cool.  All right.  Rich?  Don't look at his teeth.  They're really big.  Yeah.  Yeah, go get rich.  The local pepper tried to lure him into the car with carrots.  Oh, God.  That's terrible.  I don't want to take him to dinner.  I just want to teach him how to remember. 
[00:08:30]  Once, for Halloween, his mom painted him brown.  He went as a piano.  We're still waiting for him to go as a comic.  Painted him orange.  Painted him orange, he can go as a pumpkin.  Oh, well, with the teeth.  That really hasn't...  Right.  We met outside.  Yeah.  You two would make a hell of a face between the big teeth and the big glasses.  I know.  Look at this.  There you go.  You can help me speed read?  I can help you remember also, which is even more important, because if you read fast and  you don't remember anything, what's the point? 
[00:09:00]  What is the point?  Right.  Right.  Fastest reader teaching the world's dumbest person.  Well, I think we could show that there's a lot of genius in him, just with a little  help.  In fact, the people listening at home and in their cars can do this with us.  Just don't read anything with the word tortilla in it.  Yeah.  Or cuisine.  That'll calm down cuisine.  Yeah.  I don't think the people in their cars will be learning anything today.  I think they're going to be changing the station right about now.  Oh, have some fun.  All right.  How fast can you read, sweetie?  Well, my top speed is 80 pages a minute. 
[00:09:30]  Oh.  But you can read 80 pages a minute.  At my top speed.  Wow.  You ever blow out a contact doing 80 words a minute?  I got a bad paper cut.  Oh, see?  See, there's some dangers to it.  Barney Franks can't even bang 80 pages a minute.  You ever get a ticket from your reading teacher for going that fast?  No.  I know it's Barney Franks, but who needs an S?  That was a good joke, though.  Thank you. 
[00:10:00]  Okay.  Well, let me give you a list.  I'll show you the list, and you're not going to know how to remember it the first time.  And then I'll show you how to remember it.  We'll see how smart you get.  You are.  Okay.  So this is for retention, so he can remember things he sees.  Right.  And the people at home and in their cars can do this, too.  It's real simple.  Okay.  How fast the brain learns with the right technique.  All right.  Let's see.  It's all about bringing it back.  Here we go.  Exactly.  Okay.  Here we go.  Pole, shoes, tricycle, car, glove, gun, dice, skate, cat, and bowling pins.  Would it be safe to say right now you don't know the whole list by heart?  Pole, shoes, bicycle, cute eyes. 
[00:10:30]  I don't know.  Pole, shoes, and bowling pins.  That's very difficult.  You say them very fast.  Yes, I did.  I could say 20 words right now.  You wouldn't remember them all.  Not all of them.  What I'm going to do now is show you how to remember.  I'm going to give you a method.  All right.  And one of the things the brain likes is one of the things I learned when I was in college  is it likes context.  If you can count to 10, and I'm betting you can, we're going to use those numbers as the  context.  Do you know what 2 plus 2 is?  Oh, I'm not sure. 
[00:11:00]  Diarrhea.  That's what it is.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right.  Let's go.  Okay.  That seems to me to do this.  Okay.  The number 1, does that look a lot like a pole standing up on the ground?  A big number 1?  A big number 1?  Yeah.  Not a number 2 here.  Number 1.  Big number 1.  Maybe if you said it was rubbing on his face.  Hey, Norton was cranking a pole next to him in bed with a girl in between.  I guess a big number 1 would look like a pole.  So when I say 1, what are you going to remember?  What am I going to remember?  A pole. 
[00:11:30]  Okay.  You did it.  Very good.  1.  Pole.  Perfect.  Now number 2.  How many shoes are you wearing?  Well, 2.  And that's the answer.  This only works with two things.  What if Mabel King was playing?  What if one was shoe?  Yeah.  What if one was shoe?  I don't remember this stuff.  There are other ways to do that.  I'm just telling you a method.  Okay.  That's easy to learn quickly.  And in my program, I have many methods for every other contingency.  But if Mabel King was here, would you have to start with zero?  So if you said, how many legs do you have? 
[00:12:00]  That's a possibility.  Okay.  So what is...  So if I go to my kids' list, they're going to go shoes.  Right.  One is the pole and two?  Yeah.  Two is the...  Okay.  Shoes.  Two is shoes.  Good.  Three, tricycle.  How many wheels are on a tricycle?  Don't stretch for this one.  It's a number between two and four.  Right.  It's not a fraction.  All right.  Relax there, Woody Allen.  There we go.  Three.  Three. 
[00:12:30]  So three is...  Three is a tricycle.  Good.  Two is a...  One is pole, two is shoes, three is tricycle, one pole, one pole meeting a tricycle, and  two is shoe.  There you go.  Tainted blood.  Four is a car, four wheels.  Four is how many times I'm going to punch you in the head if you're doing this.  No, I like what he's doing, though.  He's worked.  You know how many children are having trouble in school today because they don't know how  to learn, they don't remember?  I can think of five in Houston with the last name Yates. 
[00:13:00]  Hey, Howie, being an old teacher, can you teach Moss how to write a joke?  That's right.  Oh, oh.  Don't listen to him.  He usually just works the board here.  Go ahead.  Four is a car.  A car has four tires.  A car has four tires.  And one is a...  And one is...  A hole.  A hole, you idiot.  A hole, shoes, tricycle, car.  Four tires.  There you go.  Five.  And it's a hot car, and I'm driving it, and Anthony's mom's sitting next to me on a  date because she finds me cute.  Okay.  There you go.  I completely lost you. 
[00:13:30]  Wait, I want to hear the rest.  That's the whole method, right?  Now you're...  Well, that's a method.  There's many methods.  So you run through the numbers, and now you're remembering what is what.  Exactly.  Which is better than not remembering 15 minutes after you're done reading the name of the book  and who wrote it.  So how do you make that?  Now, I see what you're saying.  Right.  But how do you take that and translate that into this?  You're talking apples and oranges.  When it comes to reading really fast, how does that retention come?  Exactly.  Because one is apple, one is oranges.  Exactly.  When you're reading fast, what you're doing is you're running a movie. 
[00:14:00]  When you read a book or a magazine or a paper, you're hearing the voice in your head speaking.  Someone's telling me about it.  Which is what keeps...  I don't know what it's saying, and I'm not sure I want to know, but it's speaking.  Oh, I was saying, don't worry.  When you write...  You're all from the top half up.  But when you read the road...  Hold on there.  Howie Bryant on line one says, if Voskett's speed read, how will his midget hands turn the pages?  Howie, don't look at his hands.  Yeah, it'll be horrified. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, my God.  Don't look at them.  His hands like Paul Williams.  His two hands can't cover your big glasses.  He's not going to be a piano player, my friend.  Not at all.  And he sucks on the origin.  Give me ribs to put my elbow in.  You know when you're driving in a car, you're going about 60, 70 miles.  Well, I'm driving in my car down the Jersey Shore.  Wah, wah, wah. 
[00:15:00]  Sorry you were inspiring me.  Do you also speed...  I passed a pole walking on my two shoes.  And I saw a tricycle.  In my car!  Whoa, whoa, whoa!  Wait, I want to know what William Frawley pants...  Hey, Rick!  We're speed reading.  Why, sure, friend!  Right, Ethel is a C and read it real quick. 
[00:15:30]  So you're driving in your car.  And you read the road, 50, 60, 70 miles an hour.  Yeah.  Wow, you're really taking chances out there.  Those signs ain't coming at you every foot.  It's Texas.  There's not 10,000 signs in a row, like there are words.  And then you go in a book at 200 words a minute, and you remember about 10%.  Right.  Same mind.  So what I found was, why can a person remember in a car so much information so well?  Read in your car, you're saying. 
[00:16:00]  No?  No?  Drink and then go to Ireland.  The secret is, put the book on your windshield, and as the wind blows the pages...  I think he's joshing.  He's pulling your leg.  I think you're joshing with us now.  The bottom line is, how does reading fast get you laid?  That's what it's all about.  Women dig, guys who read.  He doesn't know.  Come on.  Now, stop.  Women dig, guys who read.  Hey, come on.  Yeah.  Come on.  That's true.  All the hotties, you know.  Really?  You can read the law real fast according to what state you're in.  You go, oh, 14 is all right here. 
[00:16:30]  Howie, do you get the hotties?  Well, you've got to look at Bill Gates for a minute, okay?  The man's got $90 billion.  He reads a lot.  Hey, it makes you hot.  Those $90 billion don't hurt.  No, no.  $90 billion and reading quickly.  Yeah, it must be the reading.  That's it.  Well, it wouldn't be the billion.  And you've got Bill Gates' glasses on, too.  That's true.  The women can't be that shallow.  It was the money.  They are that shallow.  Yeah.  Hey, could you read something real fast?  Sure.  Just buy and bust. 
[00:17:00]  You little angel.  He just read the headline on the newspaper.  Oh, Jiminy Brickett.  If I was a girl, I'd have a miscarriage right now.  Why wait?  Hey.  Look at that little buddy thump on the floor.  That was going to be something.  Jumping Josephette.  Think back to when you were...  You had to do all that swimming, and you're right...  You're almost there.  Right.  And I also remember, at that time, winding up on Voss's chin. 
[00:17:30]  Okay.  Let me read this first article.  At least I have one.  That really hurt, Rich.  I'll read this first article here, Jim.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Do you want to pick one?  No, I believe him.  No, of course believe him.  Go ahead.  Did you read that before he came in?  Scout's honor?  No.  All right, because one's apples, one's oranges.  Why don't you pick out an article?  Let her rip.  Let her rip.  Okay.  He's just skimming, skimming, while reading on the radio.  It's always exciting.  It's about Gambini.  He hit a 455-foot home run in Cleveland, which was one of the... 
[00:18:00]  Gambini?  Gambino?  I heard from New York it could have been Gambino.  I don't know.  She ought to be Gambino.  That means Mike Stanton sleeps with the fishes.  Oh, Gina, you're not going to see him no more.  Take the bat.  Leave the cannolis.  Look how they massacred my pitching staff.  Don't play with my balls. 
[00:18:30]  Anyway.  You don't want to see, Stady.  Well, now you've had your Frank.  Now you get the hell out of here.  He was banging hot dog vendors two at a time.  He's reading again.  He's reading again.  He's reading again.  Oh, there he goes.  There he goes.  All right.  Look at those little fingers.  Look at him go.  Let's see if he can read with a finger in his tuchus.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  It's in, I think, Phoenix or Arizona, and they're talking about...  Phoenix or Arizona.  ...some college football players, and they're trying to stay on the team.  He even picks the dull stories.  ...and having some problems.  It was a pretty dull story.  Yeah, a pretty dull story.  It didn't make interesting reading for that five seconds.  Is this reading, or does he pick the headline and then guess?  I know.  That's right.  I know.  He sounds like the Kreskin of reading.  And he comes up with his baseball bat.  Is he going to fly against the door?  The secret is you actually feel the print through your fingers like Daredevil. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, is that it?  There you go.  Well, I absolutely believe you read quickly.  It's really easy to learn.  I can tell.  I can see that.  We teach this on tapes to people if they want information and call 888-28-BRAIN.  888-28-BRAIN.  Or they can go to the website, quickreader.com.  Yeah.  And it's guaranteed.  They'll double their speed.  They'll learn how to remember.  They'll learn how to retain.  They say that information doubles every 18 months, and more words are printed every week  than in all of human history through the year 1800. 
[00:20:00]  The average person is reading about 200 words a minute, and their entire income is dependent  on what they know.  So by learning how to learn...  So you can't talk fast while you read?  The world's fast.  I was actually on with the drama show of the fastest speed...  Oh, boy.  Whoa, that must have been a show.  Yeah.  I can talk about that.  So long, dude.  Hey, I don't know why we didn't get an Emmy.  But anyway...  I know.  He goes at 2,500 words a minute.  I thought 25,000.  Oh.  Wait, wait, wait.  My speed's bigger than his. 
[00:20:30]  Ooh.  That's like a schlong joke.  Get him out of here.  Hey, I'm like, now, do you have a copy of that book?  Because I'd like a copy of that book or whatever.  Actually, I'd be happy to copy a program, because you guys probably have to do a lot of reading  to stay on top of what's going on.  No, no, no.  Have you ever listened to this awful show?  Yeah.  That would be called show prep.  Yes, you do.  Yes, you do.  You know, but I'd like a kit and to improve my reading, you know.  Yes, absolutely.  You know, school's starting soon.  A lot of parents are really concerned. 
[00:21:00]  I don't have kids, but I do pick them up afterwards.  We're kidding, Howie.  Let's get them out of here.  Hey.  All right.  Hey, you want to quick it in?  Your mother broke her leg.  Hey.  You want my reading kit?  Come in the car.  Right.  That old gag.  That old gag.  The old reading kit in the car.  Yeah.  The parents are really concerned.  You know, one-third of 17-year-olds can't put France on a map.  Not that you'd want to anyway, if you think about it.  Oh, I see.  You don't like the French.  Ooh, a little zinger there. 
[00:21:30]  I've been to France.  I've been to Paris.  The world's most obnoxious people.  We went into a restaurant.  Oh, boy.  I speak French, as you can tell from my accent, very well.  And I asked for the no smoking.  The guy threw me, my 83-year-old father-in-law.  Oh, my goodness.  Threw us out in the street.  Threw you out?  Really?  Where is he now when we need him?  That's a little joke.  Come on.  I see Paris.  I see France.  I see Howard's underpants. 
[00:22:00]  Hey, if you don't want to refish, you're going to end up like Andrew Dice Clay.  That's the good example of you.  Ah, right.  I know.  Do you want your children to be like that?  Yeah, who wants your kids selling out arenas and being a millionaire?  Multi-millionaire.  Yeah, that sucks.  Who is he to call up and look to start a problem between me and you?  Tommy.  You got your money, Tommy?  What time is it?  You got a boyfriend.  Why aren't you talking now? 
[00:22:30]  See, now you upset Dice.  I like him, by the way.  He's a funny man.  Can't beat him to baseball.  He is funny.  I enjoyed it.  All right.  Okay.  Howard.  Howard.  Thank you so very much.  This has been very enlightening.  What was your last name again?  Name is Berg.  And one more time, if people call 888-28-BRAIN or quickreader.com, they get six tapes, a video  to workbook, a money-back guarantee.  It's perfect for them and their families and children to stay on top of information because 
[00:23:00]  we live in a world where information determines your ability to make a living.  Does that kit come with a prosthetic vag since you won't be getting any real?  I don't think so, but it has a plastic wrapper.  And if you're innovative, perhaps you could use it for 888-28-BRAIN.  Thank you so much.  I appreciate it.  I know my brother.  You've got to buy your own.  There you go.  I thought maybe they were without that number.  There you go.  Howard, what was your last name again?  It's Berg.  Berg, B-E-R-G, Berg the Texan. 
[00:23:30]  There you go.  All right.  Howard Berg.  That's right.  Howard Berg.  Berg.  B-E-R-G.  Wait, how do you spell that again?  B-E-R-G, Berg.  Howard Berg.  Howard Berg.  Howard Berg.  You got it.  Is that one word?  Howard Berg or Berg?  Howard is one word.  Berg is a second name.  So, what's the last name?  Well, I think it's Berg.  Now, if you want to get technical, my middle name is Stephen. 
[00:24:00]  That's S-T-E-P-H-E-N.  So, that's how it's Stephen Berg.  Oh, so your last name...  Not Stephen Berg, but Stephen Berg.  So, your last name is...  Berg.  And the number was 888-28-BRAIN.  Ah.  It's 10th and Red Bank.  There you go.  QuickReader.com.  This is even uncomfortable for me.  I appreciate it.  It's been a lot of fun.  You guys are...  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, Howard.  If you guys are free...  Well, for some of us...  If you're free on Saturday...  What?  If you're free on Saturday...  You want to go out? 
[00:24:30]  What happened?  What do you want to do?  Yeah.  What does a guy like you do on the weekend?  Go to a jitterbug?  I'm teaching a class in New York, and I'd be happy to bring you in as my guest.  Ooh.  What time is the class?  It's from 10...  I'm working!  No, I'm sorry, Angel Fate.  What time is it?  My health won't allow it.  No.  My wife used to do everything for me and lead me to my writing.  Your wife?  Is she away?  No, she's dead!  She was very badly bored, you see?  Well, you strike me as soon as... 
[00:25:00]  The doctors told me it was pneumonia, because it happened certain months later.  It flew epidemic.  The doctors told me it was pneumonia, but I knew what it was!  She was bored by a fat man!  Poor, poor girl!  You strike me as a guy who reads a lot.  It sounds like you guys do a lot of reading.  We just watch movies, Howard.  Howard, Howard, and I'm speed-reading this instant feedback, and it's brutal.  And the first... 
[00:25:30]  One of the first habits is be proactive.  Howard?  Yes.  Your mic went out.  What happened?  Oh, my God.  What happened?  There was a short in that mic over there.  Could you go to that mic?  Yeah.  Mine went a little weird, too.  Right there.  The first habit was be proactive.  Say you wanted to actually remember it.  Right.  You see a bee stinging you on the head, and you think of your...  Are you hearing him?  Howard.  That mic went out, too.  Dude, what's wrong with the mics?  What the hell's going on?  It's scary.  Oh. 
[00:26:00]  No, they're both off.  Can you move over there?  Hold on.  Here.  Here you go.  Is this a joke, or...?  No, I wasn't sure.  No, I wasn't sure.  Oh, my goodness.  We wouldn't be able to pull a fast one.  We have a lot of...  You're an intelligent guy.  We have a lot of technical problems on this program sometimes.  No electricity.  Yeah.  Oh, that's one.  Sure.  It helps with radio.  I don't know everything about radio.  I know electricity does help.  I'll say.  There you go.  I read a lot.  Be proactive.  Imagine a bee stinging you on the head, and you think of... 
[00:26:30]  What's wrong?  Yeah?  It went dead.  What went dead?  We still hear you?  I hear you, right?  I hear you.  Maybe it's your headphones now.  Oh, okay.  Well, when you think of your head, you remember...  Right.  Be proactive.  What?  Because I'm hearing it.  I hear you fine.  You're mine.  You're on.  Howard.  First of all, get Pete Johnson, because that mic's out, too. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  They're all hooked up.  They're not going to be able to do a show.  The same power system.  Yeah.  No, this is for real.  We're a syndicated show in 20 cities.  This should not be happening.  And we get problems like this all the time.  You're going to have to use a can.  Howard, they can't hear you.  Come over here.  This mic never goes out.  Yeah.  I'd love to talk into a can.  I was going to say...  You can use this mic right here.  You're going to have to get a can with 26 million strings attached so people can...  Get Pete.  Hear you guys. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, I know.  It's not an Anthony show.  Quite some time.  All right.  Here.  This is my big move.  My big power move.  There you go.  Now you're right.  Is that mic working now?  Opie's mic?  Opie just stepped out to get Pete.  It's working.  He's looking for him.  Go see if we can...  Okay.  Go get Pete.  Lock the door.  Okay.  Yeah, right.  Let's set up my contract.  Yeah, whatever it is.  Oh, my goodness.  So the...  Oh, you got Pete.  Okay.  Hold on.  Two seconds.  Two seconds.  Don't worry about it.  All right.  This is the Howie Berg Show, and I'm Howie Berg, coming live from New York. 
[00:28:00]  Okay.  Everyone else is gone, so let's start learning how to remember.  Okay.  We had our list of ten items.  The first item was one.  One is pole.  Two.  How many shoes are you wearing?  Wearing two shoes, so two is shoes.  And I don't know where anyone has gone, so it looks like it's turned into the Howie Berg  show.  Three.  Three.  Three.  How many wheels are on a tricycle?  Three.  So three is tricycle.  And while we're on the number three, remember to call 888-888-28-BRAIN. 
[00:28:30]  That's 888-28-BRAIN or quickreader.com.  Where did everyone go?  Who's Mr. DVD?  Hello, America.  Opie and Anthony want you to vote for boobs.  Wait a minute.  That can't be right.  Vote now for your favorite WoW contestant on OpieandAnthony.com.  Then August 8th, Opie and Anthony will announce the top 20 finalists on the Opie and Anthony 
[00:29:00]  show.  One and two, seven.  The Opie and Anthony show.  WNEW.  Mike Tyson in the news again.  Oh, God.  This guy.  Big fight coming up, as we all know by now.  And what a scumbag Don King is. 
[00:29:30]  No news there.  I mean, no big revelation on that one.  Oh, yeah.  He's in the paper today calling Tyson, Tyson, what, a poster boy for the KKK.  For the KKK.  I guess he feels that what Mike does in public hurts the black man because it's kind of,  you know, a stereotypical behavior, things like that, as opposed to Don King, who, you  know, killed somebody. 
[00:30:00]  He should talk.  And he's living quite large off of all the money he made off of money.  Yeah, the only reason he's saying these things now is because he's done using Mike Tyson.  Mike Tyson doesn't work for him anymore.  If I wasn't such a big faggot, I would punch him in the face.  But I've come out of the closet.  Tyson, you're a faggot now?  I don't think that's exactly what I said.  And I sure ain't going to say it in this forum.  But I think I'm more lenient towards the homos. 
[00:30:30]  I think I'm a little more accepting to the faggot.  I think they want to be called homosexuals.  Butt pirates.  I'm more accepting and open to the gay lifestyle.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm getting tired of women.  The high-pitched screams hurt my ears, so I figure a manly yell might not be as bad when  I'm plowing them in the keister.  So, you're going gay?  Well, no, all I said was, I'm not homophobic. 
[00:31:00]  So, Anthony, who's doing the voice of Mike Tyson right now...  No, I'm not.  I'm just looking on.  ...wants everyone to know that Mike Tyson is now going gay.  No, no, no, no.  I'll set the record straight here.  Pick up that megaphone of yours and tell everybody in Tyson's voice.  I don't see a megaphone.  Went...  I'll read the story.  Yeah, you'll read it.  I'm just going to sit here next to Anthony.  So, Mike, you're thinking of going gay?  I don't know.  It's just lifestyle I might want to check out. 
[00:31:30]  I call it...  I think I handled it like the army.  Don't ask, don't tell.  Don't ask what I'm doing to your ass, and don't tell the police.  Tyson hugs off accusation.  First, Mike Piazza says he's not gay.  Now, Mike Tyson professes that he wouldn't hate him if he was.  So, you like Mike Piazza if he was gay?  He's got a cute butt.  I like his buns. 
[00:32:00]  I'm just talking like if I was a faggot.  But I'm not homophobic.  Homophobic.  R-O-L-A-I-D-S.  Homophobic.  I spell good.  It starts with an H, Mike.  H-O-L-A-I-D-S.  Homophobic.  All right.  To prove it, Tyson got out of his SUV and hugged a demonstrator here yesterday who shouted,  stop homophobia at him.  Tyson's in town to fight heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis.  They don't talk about how I got out of the SUV. 
[00:32:30]  How'd you get out of the SUV, Mike?  Well, they open up the tailgate and pull the big cage out and then set me free in an area  that I won't disturb like the dumps.  It's called the Mike Tyson Relocation Program.  They put the collar on me and you should see them all scurry away when they open that door.  But yeah, I got out of my SUV.  I thought they hit you with the tranquilizer and just waited for it to wear off.  That's what they do first.  But then they put a tattoo on the inside of my lip. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  They attach a collar with a radio transmitter around my neck and they put a clip thing in my ear.  And I'm all like drowsy and they measure how long I am and my claw at my hands.  And then they put me in there and relocate me so I don't eat the garbage out of the dump and eat little children's.  Lennox Lewis' children's.  I will eat his children.  Children's.  It's like a lojack they put on me so they can find out where I am if people start dying and getting butt-assed. 
[00:33:30]  Look, they found a pattern.  Look at the pins on the map.  We have 50 people got butt over here in this area.  Some children got eaten over here.  And there's some ladies with their esophagus is hanging out their mouths.  Oh, Mike.  I do some damage.  Yes, you do.  We all know that.  Can I finish this little story there, Mike?  Do it the f*** you want.  It's about you, though.  Okay. 
[00:34:00]  When Tyson pulled up to a fitness center, he was greeted by gay rights activists angry at his use of gay slurs.  You've used a lot of gay slurs in the past there, Mike.  Don't use gay.  That's a bad word to use for them.  How do you spell bad?  Bad?  P-R-Q.  That's so stupid.  I did not even use a vowel.  Okay, I'll try again.  R-L-C.  R-L-C?  L is a vowel. 
[00:34:30]  That's the sometimes vowel.  No?  No?  What do I know?  Finish the f***ing story.  Okay.  Here's the gay activists talking now.  I was shouting stop homophobia and holding up my sign, and then he just came up and hugged me and said he wasn't homophobic, said Jim Maynard, vice chairman of Equality Tennessee.  I was totally shocked.  I didn't know he was saying that.  I couldn't understand it with my f*** in his mouth.  Mouth. 
[00:35:00]  M-O-F.  Oh, that was good.  I got that one.  Well, you were close.  I love the fags.  They put up a tad more fight than the bitches do.  They could take a punch better than Robin Givens, and I hit her harder than, oh, man, I punched her f***ing face in.  It was beautiful.  That was the best punch I ever threw.  F-R-E-U.  No, it's not.  I'm getting better at this.  No, you're not.  Homos like to be punching the testicles.  They enjoy it like my tiger. 
[00:35:30]  You're using slurs again, Mike.  Oh, I don't want to use the gun, because I'm not homophobic.  Right, you're not.  I was inoculated against that.  How did I even get inoculated out?  Stop it.  That's ridiculous.  How do you spell inoculated?  Oh, don't make Mike's head explode.  It's very thick.  And what does that mean?  Oh, it's like a shot they give you to keep from being something, and I didn't want to be homophobic.  I am a member of the gay community. 
[00:36:00]  Where do they give you that shot?  In the keister?  They give it to you in the can, and I give it to everybody else by proxy.  Proxy.  I give it to every...  Oh, sorry.  I give it to everybody else by epoxy.  Epoxy.  Comes in a pump dispenser, and you better pump it, you f***ing f***.  Hey, that's another slur.  Calm down over there.  They know I love them, the homos.  You know what's embarrassing about gay love, though?  Because, you know, I've been involved now with the homo community. 
[00:36:30]  You ever, you know, you do it the gay way.  You know what I'm talking about.  And when you take out your mule...  What's the gay way?  You know, the back way.  And then you pull your mule out, and there's something left on it.  You're like a pancreas.  You thought I was going to say...  Right?  Yes, I did.  See, pancreas, they're funny.  They're not so funny, all of them. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, my favorite song.  I like bending over the gay men during this little tune.  And f***ing them hard.  Pancreas, P&A, I forget it.  You can dance.  You can dance.  Pancreas, P&A, I like this song. 
[00:37:30]  I'm going to see Mamma Mia on Broadway.  Pancreas, P&A, I like this song.  Pancreas, P&A, I like the Fernando. 
[00:38:00]  That was a good song.  Which one's this?  Oh, I love this one.  Ooh, look at me there.  So, my big paws in the air.  I mean, hands.  Ooh, I'm f***ing man.  Hallelujah.  I'm f***ing man.  In the f*** hole, I'm f***ing man.  Shut up, b***h. 
[00:38:30]  The gay community, since I come out of the closet and figure I'm going to be f***ing a lot of men,  they have dubbed me even more harmful to them than AIDS.  Well, because I'm so big.  All right, that one didn't work.  Oh, check it out.  Mike's body. 
[00:39:00]  Drill my body.  Gonna f*** you with my body.  Gonna f*** my body.  Every man wants to be like Mike Tyson.  F***ing everybody.  All right, enough of this song.  All right.  I'm tired of the gay songs.  But, yeah, I accept the homos now.  Can I finish here?  I'll finish on you.  No, that's okay. 
[00:39:30]  We're here.  We're clear.  I'll f*** you and bite your ear.  I didn't find nothing that rhymed with that too quickly.  I understand.  The befuddled activist added.  Befuddled?  Do you know what befuddled means?  It means you're a sucker.  Because he's a f*** and faggot.  That's another slur, Mike.  But I'm being nice.  I told him I hugged him.  You've turned the corner.  You don't do the slurs anymore.  I hugged him and I whispered sweet nothings in his ear.  I said, I'm gonna f*** you till you love me. 
[00:40:00]  Can I finish?  This activist didn't know what to do when you hugged him, Mike.  Of course he didn't.  He felt my member and thought it was the guy that was standing next to me.  It was so big.  And then he looked and no one's there.  He go, who is that?  I said, it's my c***.  I swear to God, it's like a piston off a P-51 Mustang.  Big, fat, and long. 
[00:40:30]  I'm making move just as fast, too.  The P-51 Mustang was an escort fighter for the bombers in World War II, really turning the war around for our air battle over Berlin, letting the bombers have more air cover while leaving England for longer periods of time, decimating the German Luftwaffe.  I don't know, I watched the Discovery Channel and thus changing the course of the war. 
[00:41:00]  War, R, C, why do all my words start with R?  It's called a crutch.  I f***ing suck.  So, more from the activist.  So, I just posed with him and smiled for the cameras.  It's a step in the right direction, he says.  As he drove off later, he rolled down the window and explained, I told them I'm not homophobic, so if I use a homophobic term, I'm not homophobic. 
[00:41:30]  Isn't that a coincidence because I'm also not a homo sapien?  I'm somewhere down the chart between the little, you know, you ever see the chart with the little hairy monkey guy and he's got the long arms?  Yeah.  And then there's the guy who's like walking with a briefcase.  And in between somewhere, I say about two-thirds the way up the chart and Mike Tyson.  I'm the missing link that's attractive to the gay community. 
[00:42:00]  Get your balls out.  Slap your ass off.  Grab your sport on.  It's the day.  Though it may not be anyone's birthday.  And it's not near the 4th of July.  I love all your gay guests on this program.  I love Mario Cantone.  Yeah.  I love gay Marco.  Yeah.  I love Jay Moore.  Well, Jay's not gay.  Boy, you know.  That's the unseen episode of Moore Sports. 
[00:42:30]  It was how much more of Mike Tyson could Jay take up his...  And let me tell you, it was everything.  You thought his face was red before.  You should have seen it now.  Well, it's good to say you're more open-minded, Mike.  Yeah, I figure you've got to be in this day and age.  You know, just because I look like this, I don't live in the Stone Age.  I understand that, you know, it's the 20th century. 
[00:43:00]  21st century.  21st.  Well, I wasn't going to correct you there, Mike.  Don't correct me.  No, all right.  You can bend over and I'll b*** you, but don't correct me.  It's okay.  I'll give you the donkey punch.  Imagine looking around, giving a fisheye and seeing my big smiling face.  You know what I look like?  If I'm plowing your a** and you turn around and look at me,  remember when King Kong smiled at Fay Wray through the window? 
[00:43:30]  Remember that look?  Yes, we do.  That's the look you see before you black out from blood loss.  There ain't no need for people's intestines to be straightened out for that amount of space.  See, because they wind around in your lower abdomen.  Yeah.  And they ain't supposed to be straight for a good foot or two.  Not like that.  I like a nice sphincter muscle.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, so I'm accepting the gaze. 
[00:44:00]  Well, yeah.  And you can find that out on my 900 number.  Mike Tyson's gay men's sex line.  Hi, this is Mike Tyson.  You've reached the hottest man's sex line ever.  Do you like big s***?  Short in your s***?  I bet you do.  You a hot, gay Mike Tyson's sex.  But you could try it without Mike Tyson.  I'll give you the Mike Tyson s*** sex simulator. 
[00:44:30]  Lay on the ground in front of a construction site on your belly.  Pulls your pants down.  Wait for the roofer to drop a roll of tar paper.  If it hits correctly and goes in your s*** hole,  that's exactly what sex with Mike Tyson would be like.  Oh, only if a big thing of cement falls on top of it, too.  I could push hard. 
[00:45:00]  Most girls complain about a little pain in that area after the s*** sex with me.  Not me.  The girls complain about sinus trouble.  That's how far up that m****** goes.  I swear to you.  And when I s***, when I s***, you know what it look like?  What?  You ever see that Play-Doh fun factor where you push the top  and it squeezes out the little guy's ears and nose? 
[00:45:30]  That's always fun with the Play-Doh.  You ever play that?  You put it in, you push his head down, and it comes out the ears and nose?  I saw a chick do that once.  And I said, don't go to the cops, you m******.  I almost popped the b***h's head right off.  It flew right off.  It was the funniest thing.  So I'm into the gay, man.  All right.  I'm into the gay community.  You know what was funny?  It reminded me of a romantic movie I saw.  I figured I laid down on my back and let the guy get on top. 
[00:46:00]  You know what I'm talking about, right?  And run it that way.  Yeah.  And then it reminded me of the movie Alien because my member burst right out of his chest.  Come on.  He couldn't take it.  F*** you, pussy.  Thank you, Mike.  So I'm very much more accepting.  A little more open-minded.  Good luck with the big fight.  I suffocated a girl giving her the Roman war helmet once.  My yam bag.  She was like a plastic bag over a child's head.  She couldn't breathe. 
[00:46:30]  Breathe.  Breathe.  Aw.  There's my stupid arm again.  X-L-I-S-O-C-P-Q.  I'll see you at the fight.  When am I fighting?  When am I fighting?  On Saturday.  Saturday.  Yeah.  I'm on.  It's on.  It's on.  Lewis Tyson is on.  I'll see you at the fight, guys.  Okay.  Thank you, Mike.  My boyfriend's in the corner.  We'll talk to you after the fight, okay?  Thank you.  We'll talk to you on Monday.  He's not fighting in New York anywhere anytime soon. 
[00:47:00]  Jersey or anything, right?  He's in Tennessee, and we're not syndicated to Tennessee, so you're safe for now.  All right.  Hello, America.  Opie and Anthony want you to vote for boobs.  Wait.  Wait a minute.  That can't be right.  Vote now for your favorite WOW contestant on opieandanthony.com.  Then August 8th, Opie and Anthony will announce the top 20 finalists on the Opie and Anthony show.  1027 WNEW.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:47:30]  1027 WNEW.  Not at all.  No, I'm not stuck at it.  I had to whiz.  I was in the right after you to go to the bathroom.  We got Shavo in front of us.  He's the biggest Aussie fan in the world.  Hello, sir.  It's a pleasure.  Bring it.  Are you a fan of System of a Down or what?  They did a phenomenal Sabbath cover.  I forget what song you covered, but it was phenomenal.  It was on activity in black.  It was phenomenal.  Snowblank.  Hey, look at that.  See, everything goes back to Aussie or Black Sabbath with this guy.  It should.  Well, that's for all rock bands.  Oh, no.  Thank you.  He's right.  He's teaming up on us today, Anthony.  No, but the root of metal came from Sabbath. 
[00:48:00]  I mean, that's just a fact.  It's not an opinion.  Of course.  Can I ask you an honest question?  Look at you, it's a validation.  Honest question.  I only want honest questions from this interview.  Okay.  Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath?  Different.  Led Zeppelin is that it's...  No, I'm a huge Zeppelin freak, but Zeppelin and Sabbath did different things to music.  Right.  Sabbath brought in that heavy...  No, I know, but you personally.  Personally, I love them both.  I don't have a favorite band.  See?  No, you know something?  No, but I don't have a favorite band because I love music.  I love art.  I can't say I have a favorite painting.  It's like, what's better, green or blue? 
[00:48:30]  You can't say that.  No.  But Jimmy, on the other hand...  And say Sabbath.  We'll say Sabbath all the time.  Yeah, of course.  Really?  We like Zeppelin.  Yeah, but Sabbath was...  You're talking apples and oranges.  Yeah, we are.  No, because Zeppelin had such more, I guess, textures in them.  Yeah, more of a blues thing.  Of course, but they came later, too.  Yeah.  I mean, I only was a very blues guitarist.  I know.  He was very, very blues.  See, we argue this point all the time on our radio show.  I started...  One of the first bands I got into was Black Sabbath, but then when I discovered Zeppelin  at an early age, there was no turning back. 
[00:49:00]  And I still appreciate Sabbath and I like Ozzy, but I think Zeppelin blows them away.  No, they don't.  All right, but it's not about...  It's about a shadow, right?  They don't either.  Ask Kelly that.  Bill Ward, very underrated.  Very underrated.  Thank you.  So how you doing, bro?  I'm good, man.  I woke up a little while ago, came here.  Did you?  What time do you wake up?  2.30.  Did you have a crazy night?  No, I just didn't sleep till like 6.  I just...  I'm still jet lag.  Okay.  I hope it's on.  Is it on?  Yeah, it's better that way.  Do you have to stick my mouth to it like this? 
[00:49:30]  Okay.  Do you do the stay up late, wake up late, rock star thing?  It's just tour schedule.  I feel I can't sleep when I'm on tour, like too early.  Why is that?  It can't be nerves.  No, it's not nerves.  No, it's just that schedule that I'm on when I'm on tour.  Yeah.  You know?  You want to be fresh for the stage too.  I'm also a night person and I create at night and I have a guitar and stuff in my room  and the only time I can write or play is when the sun is down and everyone else is asleep  and I know that I'm like one of the only ones up. 
[00:50:00]  I am such an ass, man.  River Rave, you guys are there.  A couple of years back and I wasn't familiar with the band at that point.  All good.  You know?  And now, you know, I love the band and I'm one of those guys that's like, yeah, I saw  them, man.  I saw them.  I don't remember it.  I don't remember any songs.  I don't remember anything.  It's one of those instances where I saw you guys, but I'm so psyched to see you tonight.  Well, we're excited to play.  I mean, if everything goes well, we're going to, you know, give you our best. 
[00:50:30]  Hell yeah.  You guys got a real unique sound, man.  I mean, the vocals that you guys have, it almost sounds operatic at points.  See, when we started, we've been in like a band for about nine years now.  I mean, this is when we're sort of...  Another overnight success.  Yeah, another one.  Nine years.  Everyone's like, you know, how'd you guys, like, how'd you blow up?  Well, we didn't blow up, dude.  We just played and kept on playing and playing and playing until we're here, but we're not  stopping.  We still have the same mentality we had about eight years ago, nine years ago. 
[00:51:00]  Right.  Where we're just going to keep on pushing no matter where we are.  Yeah.  If we're playing at 13 people or if we're playing to 13,000 or 100,000, you know, 1,000.  So...  But thank God it's not 13 people anymore.  I sometimes miss that.  Do you?  Yeah, because...  You miss the bone gigs?  Because it was cool to, like, know that no one knows you when you walk outside.  It was kind of a cool thing.  Right.  Yeah.  You drank all your pay money from the floor.  Whatever I wanted to do, I could do and, like, not really be looked at and stared at and,  you know, kind of talked about.  Now I can fart and someone will be like, you know, you kind of come... 
[00:51:30]  That won't happen.  Not with us.  No.  18 years ago.  Oh, yeah.  It's got to be legal.  Do we got a microphone for Kelly?  Yes, we do.  Hi, Kelly.  Hello, Kelly.  We got Kelly Osbourne joining the interview.  Hi, sweetie.  The adorable Kelly Osbourne.  I remember her.  She was very young when I met her.  I know.  I was really young.  A lot.  Yeah, you were very young.  Oh, yeah.  She's an old maid now.  No, but she's...  She's still a kid.  No, but she looks grown up and she's older.  She's turning into a woman.  You meant like a little baby?  No, like I was probably about eight the first time I ever met them. 
[00:52:00]  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, you must have met a lot of people when you were young.  So it's hard to see her with makeup on, isn't it?  Yeah.  You got a little lipstick on.  Look at that.  Looking adorable.  I am a female.  Cute.  Right.  Cute.  You must have met some people, though, when you were younger.  Yeah.  Your dad bringing people over the house?  No.  We never really...  I met most of the crazy people on the road more than at the house.  My mom wouldn't have them at the house.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  But you toured a lot, though. 
[00:52:30]  Didn't they bring you around a lot of times during the tour?  Yeah, all this time.  So you met a lot of the people backstage?  Yeah.  Was that kind of like, you know, you probably...  Don't really pay any attention to it.  Yeah, like a lot of people, that would have really psyched them up, but you were probably  just like, eh, it's some of my dad's dopey friends.  Yeah?  Any...  Any...  You've blown up because of the TV show.  I mean, everybody knows who you are.  That's got to be something.  It's...  Like, no one really knew who you were before then.  It's like, I don't really pay any attention to it, because it's like, I see it as everyone 
[00:53:00]  has their 15 minutes.  This is just my 15 minutes, and it's not going to last forever, so I don't really care.  Yeah, but it seems to be lasting a little longer than 15 minutes.  I mean, you guys are everywhere.  Everywhere you look, man.  There's TV Guide and all the magazines and stuff, and it's...  You've let cameras into your home, and now you've kind of opened it up, and it's had  to change your life a bit.  It has, like, a lot.  For the better?  Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of bad stuff, and there's a lot of good stuff, but with anything, 
[00:53:30]  you'll find that.  Do you like the attention, though?  Most of the time, I don't.  No?  No.  You're kind of a private...  You really don't like the attention at all?  I don't.  I don't like people coming up to me and telling me that they like me.  Why?  Because it's very uncomfortable.  Like, what are you supposed to say to that?  You just say, uh, thank you.  You smile and say, thank you.  All gods for that one, though.  Yeah, it's very uncomfortable.  You don't know these people, and you're very nice, but you just...  It's very...  Somebody telling you that they love you and that they really like you. 
[00:54:00]  It's very weird.  I wouldn't know.  I've never heard that.  Not even from your mom?  No.  I feel sorry for you.  That's Jim Norton, who, by the way, is the hugest fan of your father.  This guy is, like, psycho-obsessed.  He's borderline stalker.  He'll shake his head no, but he is.  You would have sex with him.  She met Ozzy.  She's the only person I've all asked.  Like you do with everybody, you idiot.  I like to ask.  I like to see him getting the respect he deserves from the other bands.  Is that bad?  No.  Not at all.  It's not illogical.  Now, who did you grow up listening to? 
[00:54:30]  It couldn't have been your dad.  I didn't...  I was...  See, I would never watch TV or...  Shut up.  Yeah.  Say system was down.  Oh, yeah.  Say system was down.  All the time.  No.  But I did...  I never really watched TV or listened to the radio.  I was just out doing things.  I never...  Me and my brother, we never really watched TV or listened to the radio.  Your brother comes off as a little weird on that TV show.  I got to tell you.  He comes off as a little wacky.  Isn't he a cool kid?  Yeah.  I was about to say something really mean to you then. 
[00:55:00]  Why?  He's my brother.  You can't talk smack about him to me.  I said how he comes off.  How does he come off?  Especially on the opening couple of episodes with the army.  You think he is weird.  No.  No, no.  No, but seriously.  No, because...  What do you expect him to be like?  After a while, I noticed that he's a normal...  What do you expect him to be like?  I'm not kidding.  What do I expect him to be like?  I didn't know.  But the way it was presented with the army thing and the bayonet and the cat...  He's a boy.  You used to do that stuff with a kid.  Wait, wait.  Talk it in the mic.  I guarantee you used to do that stuff with a kid. 
[00:55:30]  I did, but it wasn't...  I did worse.  But it wasn't on television.  So the way it's...  I said the way I perceived it.  Wow, they really stick together.  He's not taking a shot at him.  I am not taking a shot at him.  No, that's commendable by her, though.  It certainly is.  Because you would think she'd be talking crap, but she's not.  They're a very close-knit family.  They're a brother.  It's good.  It's time to tell.  Everyone always gives him hell.  You need to get off his back.  I think he's a cool guy.  See, that's...  Oh, shut up.  Oh, jackass.  I'm not messing with her today.  He's a buddy.  Crap.  He is a buddy, though. 
[00:56:00]  No, you come off like a very close-knit family, but I don't know what to make of it.  Like, a lot of people say, is this really the way the Osbournes live?  Yeah.  And, okay.  So then that's what I'm saying.  All right.  The perception...  Wait, wait.  Are you happy how the family's portrayed on the show?  Are you happy how you're portrayed?  I mean, do you know what it is?  I don't care how I'm portrayed, because people see you the way they want to see you, even if it's  not really that.  Well, that's what he's getting at, though.  It doesn't mean that's how...  People see you the way they want to see you.  Jake is in his real life, but he's saying how he's portrayed on the show.  There was a few little weird things. 
[00:56:30]  Maybe it was a wacky edit or something.  But in general, are you happy how the family's portrayed?  Yeah.  Do you think it's accurate?  Yeah, it is.  It's the way we are.  Don't help him out.  Let him backpedal.  This is really nice.  Groveling jackass.  Like, we didn't get a thousand goddamn emails when we discussed the first episode, which,  you know, I mean, the show took off, and everyone's talking about it.  Like, we didn't get a thousand emails that said, dude, what's with that jack?  You know, you didn't get that?  Am I the first person that ever said that?  No. 
[00:57:00]  That's why I'm being a little fiesty.  Oh, see, because you've heard it before.  Okay.  And you're sick of hearing it.  There's nothing wrong with him.  Just shut up.  I forgot to say that.  He's a cool guy.  I was hanging out with him.  Exactly.  He's a cool guy.  He's a cool guy to hang out with.  Is MTV playing the video yet?  I know that they said that they weren't going to play it.  What video?  Yeah.  Didn't you do one for the other one?  Oh, yeah.  Like crazy, they're playing it.  I don't watch them do that.  Papa Don't Preach.  Oh, yeah.  They play that, yeah.  They're playing like crazy.  Oh, yeah.  Were you comfortable with that?  It was like, I thought I discovered myself during that, because I never thought I'd be 
[00:57:30]  able to dance in front of a camera.  Did they have a choreographer and everything?  I wasn't like choreographer.  There was like...  No, I mean just for, you know, some of the little moves.  No.  They did this thing where they sent me to like confidence building classes.  Confidence building?  Where I had to like do stupid things in front of a mirror.  Like what?  Just like cool faces.  It was really awful.  Faces?  I hated it.  Oh, because you got to kind of smile or make like a cute look or something.  It was really...  I hated it.  Really?  Yes.  I was like...  It came off good. 
[00:58:00]  You look adorable in it.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  I have Kim some questions.  He's here too.  Come on.  Yeah, but they're going to drag you away a lot sooner than him.  We know how this stuff works.  Did you hear that?  I know.  I just got knocked right there.  Should we walk away together?  I know.  Seriously.  You're about to get off the show.  Should we walk away together?  I've seen this enough with us.  We can walk away together.  Do this move.  They wind their finger around.  They give you the cut.  They do the cut the throat thing where I was like, all right.  Wrap it up.  But what makes you think I'm going to be here forever?  I'm not.  Have you guys started taking... 
[00:58:30]  Why am I put in this position?  Because you have a big mouth.  Yes.  I do not.  Yes, you do.  I got to tell you.  He's got a really big mouth.  All the time.  All the time.  We're trying to have a good time.  He's very mean.  He does it for people.  I am the nicest guy.  We want to do a simple radio show, but he has to take it to the next level all the time.  All the time.  I am the nicest guy, and he is usually very mean and nasty.  She's not going to believe you.  But she's not going to believe you.  He's going very red, so I don't know.  It's just sunburned.  It's like 90 out there.  Believe me.  Are you doing any other tunes or anything?  Yeah, I go...  I actually lost two weeks of recording. 
[00:59:00]  For the past two weeks, I was supposed to be in the studio, but yeah.  And you're going to do another video?  I've got an album coming out in October.  You do?  Yeah.  Are you happy about that?  Are you happy about anything?  Yeah.  You seem like...  I don't.  If you think about it, that's when...  You just don't...  Just do it.  I think if you spend too much time thinking about it, then you'll find things wrong with  it.  There's going to be a lot of covers, some originals.  Look at him.  He's on his phone.  He's taking phone calls now because he's bored. 
[00:59:30]  That's all right.  I know, you could ask him a question, you know.  He is here too.  What do you think of Kelly Osbourne?  She's so beautiful.  Isn't her dad great?  Come on.  Are you guys taping the second season already?  Yes.  They're here right now.  Somewhere.  They're watching us right now.  No, actually, they can't film here because it's a union building and they'll have to pay.  Yeah, no cameras.  We noticed that.  How is this?  You got ours taken away.  Is the second season going to be different in any way?  No, I don't think so.  I thought you guys were going to film some of it overseas and stuff. 
[01:00:00]  No, I don't.  I don't think so.  That was the rumor in all the magazines and stuff.  I couldn't spend that much time in that house.  I'd have to move to London if I was.  It's like a castle, right?  It's not a castle, but it's in the middle of nowhere.  Really?  There's one store in the town and it's boring.  You don't like it over there anymore?  No, I love it though.  I just think it's like boring.  Yeah.  Does Amy want to do this season?  Is she going to do this season?  No.  Yeah, what's up with that?  He really is standing right here.  You know, you can't ask him.  Go for it.  No, no.  I'm cool.  I'm just listening.  He's just sitting and listening now. 
[01:00:30]  He's listening.  Well, you came over at the same time.  If anything, you interfered with his interview.  I did not.  She's just starting to like you.  I'm like the innocent bystander that's just chilling.  I was standing over there.  I was the innocent bystander and you guys pulled me in here.  Anybody have a joint?  Do you have a joint on you?  I can smoke while you guys talk.  Garrett will have any kind of pot you need.  We can take care of that.  I just need good pot.  We can take care of it.  You still go out with your friends and everything and just like hang out with them?  Is it a pain in the ass?  Like, are they like, oh, God, now people are coming over all the time talking to Kelly? 
[01:01:00]  I think I've learned who my real friends are.  Oh, really?  Some of them?  Oh, did this weed out some of the bitches in your life?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can I say that on the right ear?  Yes, you can say bitch.  Just not that ever-present F word that is on the odd ones all the time.  I hear in Canada, they're keeping in the curses.  I don't think it's going to be good that way.  I like the beats.  That's fantastic.  No, I'd rather hear the F word.  I saw it in Germany and it was all full blast.  Really?  Yeah, no beeps, no nothing. 
[01:01:30]  It was great.  It was like watching a different show.  Was it in German, though?  Was it dubbed?  No, no, it wasn't.  That would be odd.  No, there was like subtitles.  That'd be so funny if they dubbed it over in German.  With your brother in a little German uniform?  All right.  I'm kidding, of course.  I love it.  Look how much I'm talking about him.  Kelly, see how he is?  We forgot all about that.  He has to go right back to us.  I'm teasing, Kelly.  I think Jack is great.  I'm teasing.  Was your sister supposed to sing Papa Don't Preach?  No.  No?  She's going to sing one of her own songs.  Really? 
[01:02:00]  But I'd never written a song before that time, and I didn't, so I just started to cover  the song.  Does she want to get into recording something?  She is.  She's just doing it in her own time, like her own deal.  She doesn't...  Is she a little like, man, Kelly got this kind of...  Yes, you are!  I just want to get to the bottom of certain things.  I read a lot of stuff.  Now she's cursing me.  Kelly, I read a lot of things, and I want to separate the truth from the fiction that  I read, and the only way to do it is to talk to the source.  That's all.  You should believe everything that you read.  I know.  That's why, believe me. 
[01:02:30]  I know.  All right.  I'll shut up.  I'll shut up.  How does it feel to be going on between Zombie and Ozzy?  Isn't that great?  He's talking about me.  I'm asking him a question.  Me?  What?  Who?  Shavo.  From Sister Redone.  Uh-oh, Kelly just turned around.  Could you get me out of here?  No.  No?  It's a great honor to go on right before Ozzy.  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, it's an amazing honor.  It really is.  Do you enjoy your dad's music?  Of course. 
[01:03:00]  Wait, what happened to Shavo?  I know.  He only gets one question?  It's all good.  I smoke and talk.  I actually don't want to talk.  He's got some of Garrett's best in his hand.  I don't want to talk right now.  Oh, okay.  Good.  All right.  Now he's happy.  How long did that take you to grow?  That interview?  Like five years.  Five years to grow?  I've had it ever since I met you, so it's an ongoing thing.  All right.  Now they're doing the interview.  I couldn't imagine having facial hair.  No?  A good thing.  That would suck for you.  I know.  It wouldn't be a good one.  I know a lot of girls with that little thing going on in their top layer.  You see that? 
[01:03:30]  They wax it or bleach it or something.  A lot of them don't get it waxed off, though.  Yeah.  You could still tell.  Tell he's like, whatever.  How long did it take you to get used to cameras being around you 24 hours?  I was only like the first week.  Like at first we could come down like fully faced up and dressed up like, look at me.  And I was like, oh, I can't do this anymore.  And that was like, most of the time I didn't even like have any makeup on.  I was in my pajamas.  Are there off-limits places where the cameras can go?  I didn't like them in my bedroom.  Yeah?  They weren't allowed in my mom's and dad's bedroom, but now they are. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, I hear now they're going to be allowed?  Yeah.  Oh, what the hell can we expect from that?  What?  What?  What can we expect from that?  Are you mad?  I'm just like, are you trying to say that?  No, what I'm saying, don't put words in my mouth, you ass.  Kelly picked up on it.  I did.  I'm saying, what the hell, like, I know there are things that happen that cannot, MTV would  not air that.  I'm just saying, what could we see in the bedroom that we, we, uh.  A bed?  She doesn't want to talk about her parents having sex in.  So why are you going there?  I'm blowing myself up here. 
[01:04:30]  Why are you going there?  I wanted to make a good impression in front of Kelly.  I think she's adorable and very good on the show and everything.  And I'm coming off like an ass.  I'm sorry.  I'm ruining it for everybody.  Kelly.  Why'd you have to ask about Ozzy's bedroom?  It's not our business.  I didn't.  I said they're going to tend to.  I'm going to smack you.  I'm smacking you.  I'm sorry, Kelly.  I didn't mean to offend you.  Now Kelly's blushing.  Or anything like that.  I'm just saying, what could they get away with showing that would make putting the cameras  in the bedroom a special thing?  Like, are there conversations that happen?  How the hell are there lying in?  How does she know that? 
[01:05:00]  I'm just, I don't know.  I'm just like...  And she know that.  She's just...  You could dump that out down the line.  Well, why are the cameras in the bedroom then?  See?  I guess that's what you wanted to ask instead of asking about their sex life, Anthony.  I didn't say...  See?  See?  See, Kelly?  I didn't say a goddamn thing about that.  That's what you were thinking, I guarantee you.  No.  Oh, defend him.  They're hoping to catch a discussion or an argument or something.  If it happens, they want to have the cameras rolling.  That's all it is.  I'm sure.  But I doubt they've really been there for very long. 
[01:05:30]  Thank you, Kelly Norton.  I'm just trying to...  They can't go in.  Oh, no.  That's okay.  I'm working.  No.  I sound like your eyes are good.  No, I sound like I'm high.  I'm all separate.  You're better.  Yeah.  Hey, is the nanny going to be back for the second season?  Yeah, she's right.  Well, she went to the bathroom there, but she is.  She's got her hands full.  I did something very bad.  There was somebody outside the hotel, and he was asking for an autograph, and he was  not very attractive.  And he asked Melinda for a picture, and he put his arm around her, and I was like, isn't 
[01:06:00]  she a muffin?  And he's like, yeah, she is.  She's real cute.  He started rubbing her, and I just ran off and left her with the guy.  Very lovely.  Now, she's got her hands filled with Jack, getting him awake for school and stuff.  Actually, we don't go to school anymore.  We did the homeschooling thing during the break and finished everything, so that really  won't be a problem anymore.  That was a big part of the first season that I really liked, that you guys just weren't  going to school, and the nanny's trying to get Jack. 
[01:06:30]  I haven't been to school in years.  I hate school.  But Jack was still going to some kind of public school, because she was trying to wake  him up all the time.  Do you know what it is?  Uh-oh.  School just never was very fun for me and my brother, because we just didn't get along  with the kids very well.  And it was very uncomfortable.  Well, you guys discussed it in the first season.  It's kind of a drag being known as Ozzy's kids sometimes, right?  It's not a drag being that.  Oh, or the stupid questions they bring up.  What are you saying, Opie?  Yeah.  Why would it be a drag?  Now you put your foot in your mouth there. 
[01:07:00]  No, no.  They discussed this on the first season, so I am saying.  No, no.  They never said it was a drag to the Ozzy's kids.  They asked you guys the same stupid questions about, you know, your father bit the head  off a bat, bit the head off a dove.  No, it's pure immaturity.  It's like, as soon as, like, the minute that somebody leaves high school, they change.  Yeah.  Why is that?  Because you don't have to go to school anymore.  No, no, no.  Just like the whole, like, attitude of someone.  Like, the minute they leave high school, they change.  Into the real world, yeah.  Because high school is very clicky.  Did you do well in school? 
[01:07:30]  Like, good grades and stuff?  I did, actually.  Like, with grades.  Like, I do the work, and I get good, like, test grades, but I just was never that.  What do you want to do?  Like, where do you want to end up?  I don't know.  I'm 17.  I should know.  Yeah, but you have, like, a little idea or something.  Shut up, Jim.  I'm sorry.  God, I'm going to hit you.  All right.  Why put the pressure on her?  It's not pressure.  It is pressure.  A lot of kids have some idea of what they might want to do with their lives.  Well, maybe she just wanted to hang for a couple of years.  Why pressure the girl?  I say you take your time and relax. 
[01:08:00]  There's no rush.  I can't do one thing without me looking like a dick.  Well, we all see it, Ann.  I know what's wrong.  You all right?  I'm not going to win.  Shavo, what do you want to do when you grow up?  I want to be like her.  What a mess.  I want to be like Mike.  That's what I want to do.  Yeah?  Okay.  Are there any moments they show that you wish they had edited?  Like, eh.  No.  When Jack almost pulled your pants down?  That was kind of funny.  I don't. 
[01:08:30]  You really watch the show, don't you?  No, I am a huge fan of the show.  I love it.  I don't even watch it.  What's funny about Jack pulling her pants down?  It was a cute brother and sister moment.  No one wants to see my white ass.  That's a very embarrassing moment for her and you think it was funny.  You must get email or just letters or whatever from people that really enjoy it.  Like stupid letters.  What's the dumbest?  Remember on episode four when you weren't wearing a bra?  That was funny.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  That's not what I meant when I wrote that.  I must confess.  And what episode was that? 
[01:09:00]  I don't know.  People just like make off things.  I don't know.  And you guys are friends with Elijah Wood?  Yeah.  Because he came over.  Yeah.  He's a really nice guy.  Are you still friends with him or is he one of those persons you realize who your real friends are?  No.  No?  Not like that.  Okay.  I'm getting scared again.  No, it's just that he's been walking a lot and we've been really busy.  We haven't seen each other for a long time.  Yeah.  Any more Hollywood friends?  Like that?  No, I don't like famous people really.  Really?  Yeah.  Then you're like us. 
[01:09:30]  We sure as crap ain't famous.  It's not.  I don't.  I find that a lot of people who are famous, it just kind of happened to me.  My brother, we didn't really want it.  It was never something that we really wanted to do or be.  Yeah.  And then to people, a lot of people who are famous, it's something that they've worked for  and something that they want.  So they have this whole ego about themselves.  It's just I don't like it.  Yeah, you guys just kind of fell into it like that.  Did you know the show was going to be as huge as it got?  Really?  I thought I was cramping myself for the first couple weeks.  Like, no, I don't want anyone to watch it. 
[01:10:00]  It's going to be so bad.  And then before you knew it, it was like the biggest thing.  That's great.  Well, best, best of luck on season two.  And Chavo's famous too, Anthony.  Yeah.  I'm being like you guys now.  Watch.  He's not talking now.  Are you all right?  Look what you did.  I'm totally cool.  I'm still on the left.  You made him feel almost invisible, and that really sucked.  No, I didn't.  Look what you did.  And who did that, Kelly?  What?  Who did that?  It wasn't me.  Yes, of course. 
[01:10:30]  It was you, Anthony.  I was actually listening.  I don't feel invisible.  This was a good moment for me, because I'm usually...  Oh, there it goes.  Okay, I have to go now.  You see that?  I saw a head twitch.  Uh-oh.  Let's go.  We're out of here.  All right, bye.  Kelly, thank you very much.  Can I get a picture with you, Kelly?  All right.  Here it is.  One of Jimmy's great picture moments.  Kelly Osborne, of course.  Chavo.  Am I gone too?  Is this going on with me?  No, man.  If you want to hang, we're hanging.  We're hanging.  Do you have any questions for me?  Not really.  All right. 
[01:11:00]  No, no, I'm just kidding.  No, dude.  Now he's being the dick.  No, he shook my hand, though.  Thanks, man.  Actually, we've got to take a break, I think.  Yes.  I told me, Anthony, we're backstage at OzFest having a good time.  I hope it sounds like something out there.  When we get back, we've got to get to the lesbian sandwich booth,  and we've got to get an update from the med tent,  and I think Rick's going to be in the mosh pit with that ancient equipment in a little while.  Did Jim just get Kelly with you to drop something?  I think so, yes.  I think he did. 
[01:11:30]  That's a famous one, Jim.  Anthony, what's wrong with you today?  I did nothing.  Shut up.  You hung me out to dry, and you suck.  I'm getting you back for the John Hinckley thing.  I hate you.  You bastard.  I tried that joke out on you.  You loved it.  I hate you.  And you failed to tell me that I had the wrong serial killer.  Oh, yeah.  That made up for it, hanging me out to dry to an Osborne.  How uncomfortable was that?  Totally.  For a 17-year-old girl, I've got to tell you, Kelly Osborne is very, very intimidating.  Yeah.  Why?  What am I?  I'm saying that I'm intimidating.  She's a 17-year-old girl.  Mm, yeah.  But you were asking something. 
[01:12:00]  Yes, Jimmy?  Shut up.  You were so loving that today.  Pouring kerosene on the fire.  Dude, I'm Gary Gravel.  She's an Osborne.  I know what was great about that.  When you try to explain to someone that doesn't really know the show, they're never going to  believe you.  And it's like, look, no, I'm really the nice guy.  He's the idiot.  She's looking at you like that.  I swear, he, let me play you something.  Right.  Poor guy from the system of a town.  Yeah, I mean, I did nothing wrong.  We got the guy.  Take it easy, Mr. Hanale. 
[01:12:30]  We got him some, we got him some weed there.  He's all right.  Mr. Hanale, ref.  He's all right.  Look at him.  Yeah, he's happy.  I think he got him stuff.  He's dropping stuff over there.  He really is dropping stuff.  He's got his one hitter in his bag.  I think the baseline is going to be a little off tonight when they hit the stage.  No, that's how they play.  No, I'm just kidding, bro.  All right.  Are we ready to go back out there, Rick?  You want to go into the mosh pit?  I want to hear the medical tent, too.  I want to hear something from that.  I think where you want to go, the medical tent with the equipment or the mosh tent? 
[01:13:00]  We can do both because they're right near each other.  All right.  Very cool.  Well, we're going to step aside and regroup here and figure it out.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Of course, Jim Norton with us.  We're backstage at OzFest.  Hello, America.  Opie and Anthony want you to vote for boobs.  Wait a minute.  That can't be right.  Vote now for your favorite WOW contestant on opieandanthony.com.  Then August 8th, Opie and Anthony will announce the top 20 finalists on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:13:30]  1027-WWW.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  23 Skidoo.  That's what they get for bringing clients in here during our show.  I think we just lost about $200,000 for the station. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, nice conversation there, Jimmy.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Talk it over filter.  That's not cool.  Their latest song, Where Do We Go From Here.  This sounds good, man.  But we're too busy stirring it up.  We're stirring it up today.  We get crazy when we stir it up.  Right.  Hey, we don't know what's going to happen when we stir it up.  And Jimmy was stirring it up in front of a huge client. 
[01:14:30]  I think he misunderstood, just like I did, about part of that conversation that was going on.  Jesus Christ.  Well, we never had a chance to explain because the guy left.  I don't know how you get from, hi, this is, a little introduction.  And not even a minute later, talking about how Jimmy Norton will still go south.  After he dumps.  After he dumps.  And that's how we were talking about it. 
[01:15:00]  Well, something we brought up in the back office, he was talking about this.  He said that he has no problem performing treats.  Yeah.  Performing treats on a girl.  Performing treats on a girl.  Well, he has no problem after he has completed what he's got to do.  Yes.  Not necessarily in that end.  I know.  Right.  See, that's...  We didn't explain that.  We didn't explain that.  I was under the impression...  We didn't explain that to Anthony.  We didn't explain it to that high-profile client that just walked in. 
[01:15:30]  If I get a Hummer, and a girl's nice enough to do that, and I'm finished, lay back, get  a hold of yourself.  Right.  Okay.  That I can agree with.  But I thought you'd, you know, you'd finish up, and the product of such finishing would  be where you then would go for the treats, and...  Although, I have done that, too, but only if, you know, me and her, I don't care. 
[01:16:00]  It's mine.  So what?  I prefer not to, but then again, I'm not a rookie.  I don't...  It's like, you know, like, say you have a taco.  You don't just open a taco and just jam your face into it.  Nobody likes that.  There's a part of the top of the taco.  Right.  Say you get one from Taco Bell, and there's the top of the taco, there's a little, maybe  a little piece of a button-like thing on the top of the taco.  Right, right.  That's where you spend your time anyway.  A little piece of beef.  A little beef nugget.  So none of the other stuff that's in the taco is going to fall out of my face anyway, because  I know what I'm doing.  A little jalapeno...  A little jalapeno...  A little jalapeno pepper sticking out. 
[01:16:30]  Absolutely.  No cheese or lettuce would be falling into your face, or a sour cream.  Dude, you rookies go right in there and open up a taco and go, well, I'll eat it right  like that.  And that's not the way you eat a taco successfully.  No.  Absolutely not.  You've got to start from one end and work your way to the other end.  But there is certain techniques that do involve other areas.  You're right, absolutely.  This isn't refried beans.  Then again, if she's doing a headstand, my theory is shot. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, he's leakage.  No.  There's...  So this guy was horrified, and I don't know.  It took the station about six months to get this little meeting with this client, and they  brought him in here, and we were in the middle of this discussion, and who are we to stop  talking, because we like to stir it up?  Right.  I feel bad.  But I wasn't saying that.  I was just saying, because me and Ben were talking.  He left thinking the same thing I was thinking, that you are going to, you know, jam your face 
[01:17:30]  in the taco after you were the one that put the sour cream in the taco.  No.  No?  If during a hummer, I finish, would Ben and I were talking about...  No, you don't have to explain it again.  All right, I'd feel bad now.  But see, that guy doesn't know, and he's not listening to the radio right now.  Well, somebody go tell him.  He thinks he's a...  Oh, run up to him.  Oh, by the way.  Jim didn't mean this.  He thinks you're more disgusting than previously indicated.  And of course, if you're done, of course you would do stuff like that and keep going  and...  British Ben won't. 
[01:18:00]  ...keep the party going.  He won't.  It's tiring.  Exactly.  A little Ben gets all tuckered out.  No, no, no.  I'm with Ben, too.  I said that.  There are times it just doesn't...  It also doesn't go away.  I mean, if you're a good guy, it doesn't go away.  Oh, for me, it does.  And then you keep going.  If you're...  No, no.  What?  The rods?  You finish up, and you're still ready and raring to go, so you just keep going.  I never have had that happen.  I hate God.  Really?  I can't do that.  Ever.  Ever.  You just keep going.  You're like a stallion or something.  No, it's...  What are you talking about? 
[01:18:30]  It's a frame of mind.  It's just the way, you know...  If you're looking, and what you're looking at is really turning you on...  After you...  After you're done...  You're still ready to...  It's still ready...  Yeah, ready to go.  Ready to go.  Keep going.  Don't stop.  Anthony...  It's like putting a boot in a muck hole, though.  You know, where you're...  Because it's just...  You know, you've just made it a mess.  Hey, is there a sinkhole in that apartment?  But you just...  You know, you just keep...  You... 
[01:19:00]  Keep it going!  Yeah.  It's kind of like trying to pull a worker out of a chocolate vat.  I'm not saying every time.  Oh, God.  You haven't heard that story yet?  That is a sucks to be you.  That story is a sucks to be you.  That guy...  That is a...  An absolute sucks to be you.  Where's the story, Rick?  Because since we touched on it...  What a dopey, dopey way to go.  If you got to die, you don't want to go like this because people will laugh. 
[01:19:30]  Even loved ones that miss you because you're dead will laugh.  A 19-year-old Philly man, pronounced dead Tuesday afternoon shortly after, his co-workers at a township candy factory found him completely submerged in a 1,200-gallon vat of liquefied chocolate.  He fell in.  They said it was like quicksand.  He could not get out.  Oh, my God.  Too thick and creamy.  The vat is used for a mixing and melting chocolate.  What a way to... 
[01:20:00]  It was in operation.  What a way to die.  When Yanni Corden fell in the vat just after 4 p.m.  No one actually saw him fall in.  You know what?  Pronounced dead at the scene.  There should be a rule.  If you die that way, there should be an open casket at your wake and they don't clean you up.  So you're the human Tootsie Roll.  Everybody licks your face on the way by.  Oh, it tastes so good.  The odds of that happening are so slim, if it does, they should not clean you up. 
[01:20:30]  We've all been in a chocolate factory and you look at that vat and you say,  Boy, I'd like to fall in there and then eat my way back out.  We've all said that, right, guys?  You ass.  Man, that is just a horrible, horrible way to go.  That's awful.  And a dopey way.  One of those dopey ways to go.  As he fell in, do you think his arm came out and his thumb went up?  And then he finally sank into the bottom of the chocolate?  That creep.  I think when the co-workers found him, they said,  Hey, you've got chocolate on my human. 
[01:21:00]  Hey, there's human in my chocolate.  Then they all laughed.  Two great tastes in one.  Then they all laughed and called his family.  That is an unbelievable way to go, though.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Ugh.  All right.  At least the coroner won't know if you had skid marks or not in your underwear.  That's just one big skid mark now.  Wear clean underwear.  You never know if you might fall into a vat of chocolate.  Let's go to Lisa.  What's up, Lisa?  Hey, I was just wondering if you guys got your copy of the Bruce Springsteen album. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, really?  Everyone got a copy of that album.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  Did you get your letter?  It's not worth playing.  Bruce Springsteen is so over, it's not even funny.  And they're pulling out all the stops to make this album a success.  Everything sounds like this on every song he ever sings.  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah! 
[01:22:00]  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Enough with you.  Yeah, but this time he's got all the boys back together.  Oh, great.  Who cares?  Here I am.  I'm a Jersey guy.  I like Jersey girls.  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Oh, shut up.  Push me in a vat of chocolate before I have to listen to that crap. 
[01:22:30]  I'm sure Bruce will be singing a song about that soon enough.  Born in Jersey.  I was born in Jersey.  Born in...  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Ugh!  Enough.  It's over.  It's so over.  That working class hero thing.  Yeah.  American, you know.  Proud of Jersey.  I'm proud to be born in Jersey. 
[01:23:00]  Part of America.  America, this is a great...  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Ugh!  It's the same thing.  If you play the new album, it sounds exactly like every other album he does.  Every single one.  I'm wearing my denim.  I got my denim pants.  And I put an American flag on the back of my jacket as I sing...  Wah! 
[01:23:30]  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Yeah.  Sitting here on the boardwalk, playing at Asbury Park.  Again.  Again.  Watching all the people at the Jersey Shore.  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Shut up!  No one's buying it anymore.  It's not like the Jersey guy, you know, makes good.  Springsteen sounds a lot like Reagan. 
[01:24:00]  Well, I'm playing at the Jersey Shore.  What?  What?  What?  Hello.  Hello.  Driving down the Jersey Shore.  With my best girl in my Chevy.  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Shut up!  The screen door slams.  We got two sports teams.  We got the Devils and the Nets.  The Jets and Giants play here too. 
[01:24:30]  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Just ran out of things to sing about.  Doesn't the turnpike stink when you go through Elizabeth?  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Oh!  Someone wants you to say, in America.  In America!  Now, Neil Diamond's just a tad different.  My country, tis of thee.  Oh, she bruises, boy.  Oh, oh, oh!  They're coming to America. 
[01:25:00]  It's like the same crap, though.  Oh.  I was married to a hot actress, then divorced her for a chick in my band.  Wah, wah, wah!  I got a big Negro sax player.  Wah, wah!  My drummer's on the Conan show.  No, I don't want to hear anything off the new Bruce album. 
[01:25:30]  We've had it for a while, but...  It's...  Yeah.  Does anyone really care?  Just play old...  Just play the old albums, I guess.  All right.  Corey, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  I was just wondering why the Oompa Loompas didn't save that kid in the chocolate.  It was like that fat kid that fell in the van and got sucked into the group.  Exactly.  Augustus!  Augustus Gloop! 
[01:26:00]  Later, guys.  All right, man.  Augustus!  Augustus!  Augustus Gloop, that's right.  You don't want to die like a kid in Willy Wonka.  Where was Veruca?  Veruca.  You think this guy would have known something was wrong when he was on his way down to the  chocolate taking the elevator sideways?  Nice.  And you know that's got to flash through your mind as you're going, I'm dying in a vat of  chocolate.  Oh, my God.  I just think.  Yeah. 
[01:26:30]  It was hot and bubbling, so it would probably burn.  It was probably a very painful way to go.  Yeah.  I had to get drowned.  I don't even think you could drown in chocolate.  You'd just suffocate.  That pleasant kind of smell being associated with your agony and death.  Oh, and you just smell it.  Mmm, this is a sweet-smelling death.  Hey, we have audio of the boss of the kid that died in the vat of chocolate.  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  Scott, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  You guys hear about the asteroid.  The asteroid that's going to kill us in the year 2019? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  2019.  Who cares?  Yeah, big deal.  Like a few years from now, you're going to enjoy life as it happens.  I'll be about 51.  You've got to have faith, man.  If there's got to be.  We're going to have technology by then, and we'll just set out a spacecraft to just kind  of shoot it into smaller pieces.  Laser.  Yeah.  We'll send a laser.  No, it's like 2019, it's supposed to, there's some asteroid that says maybe might hit the 
[01:27:30]  Earth.  Who cares?  Wouldn't it be great?  They have it pinpointed to hit Earth, give or take a few million miles.  Yeah.  Oh, it's a near miss.  Well, in space, that's considered a near miss.  It only, it grazed by a 20 million mile.  Shut up!  Plenty of room.  Asteroid coming by, 20 million miles away.  Hopefully it doesn't hit Jersey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa!  Wouldn't it be great? 
[01:28:00]  If we all got a croak with an asteroid hitting, don't you want it happening during your time?  Wouldn't that be great?  Just everyone gets snuffed out at once?  No one outlives you.  Right.  No one outlives you.  You don't have to worry about being the dope that falls into chocolate vat.  As long as we can save Jersey.  Yeah.  Save the Jersey Shore.  Fill a Nevada chocolate.  How embarrassing.  Whoa, whoa, whoa!  What a dick.  Hey, when is Voss and Patrice coming here? 
[01:28:30]  So we can get going with Jimmy's tape.  They should be here in about 15 minutes.  One's a fat black guy.  One's a midget Jew.  Whoa, whoa, whoa!  What was that?  Voss.  The Voss.  Like a cartoon character.  Plugged out, little gargoyle fingers. 
[01:29:00]  Are we waiting for Colin?  We're still waiting for Colin.  He should be here in about 10 minutes.  And the world's fastest reader is here.  All right.  All right.  We're going to break now.  I just had something in my throat.  A little more Springsteen.  As we go to break, I...  Speed Reader's here.  He can read so fast.  Please give him a book about Jersey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hello, America.  Opie and Anthony want you to vote for boobs. 
[01:29:30]  Wait a minute.  That can't be right.  Vote now for your favorite WOW contestant on opieandanthony.com.  Then August 8th, Opie and Anthony will announce the top 20 finalists on the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Wheelchair Fred was on hold, Anthony.  He's got problems with the show. 
[01:30:00]  What now?  I don't know.  I don't know where he went.  Maybe he'll call back.  He wants money.  He doesn't want us to call him gay anymore.  He's not gay.  He's desperate.  That's right.  That's what he says.  He can't feel anything from his waist down.  So if you flip him over and hit him in the turd cutter, he can't feel it anyway.  I mean, you stretch him out like an old raincoat.  It doesn't mean anything.  He's fine with it.  He should be a little more giving like that.  By the way, the guy with the awful voice is Jimmy Schubert. 
[01:30:30]  The guy who sounds like he gargles with gravel, that would be Schubert.  Here's wheelchair Fred, Jimmy.  Listen to this voice.  Freddie.  Yeah.  How you doing, man?  I'm a big girl.  How you doing?  Hey, Norton.  Norton, he's saying hey.  Hey, Norton.  Hello, Fred.  I don't know.  This is Jake.  Come on down.  What?  All right.  I didn't catch that one.  This is Jake. 
[01:31:00]  Come on down.  Right.  Wheelchair Fred.  You have a problem with people saying that you go with guys?  No.  Can you tell Schubert this story?  I just love this story.  What?  You don't want to tell him?  No, no.  Here, I'll just run through it quickly.  Yeah.  If Fred tells it, I'm going to need a wake-up call.  Go ahead.  Let's cut to the chase.  Well, I can.  You know, the guy, oh yeah, it is a long story now that I think about.  He had a motorcycle accident. 
[01:31:30]  Right.  He ended up in a wheelchair, not because he's paralyzed, but the doctors really effed his  legs up.  So his legs aren't functional.  He can still feel his legs.  His spine is a little screwy, too.  Yeah, a little bit, but not that bad.  And his voice box obviously crushed.  His voice box was crushed, so he can't talk.  He's still there.  But his mind is fine.  He just cannot communicate with people.  What kind of a hell is that to live in?  Yeah, that is a hell, you know.  So he has trouble getting girls now because he's in the wheelchair.  He talks like that. 
[01:32:00]  Everyone thinks he's retarded.  So he went so long without getting laid, he opened up his options a little bit and said,  all right, if guys want to have sex with me, that's fine.  Well, see, that's the thing.  See, guys will have sex with anything.  I've been with some guys in the condo that they'll hump a sofa down the hallway at 3 o'clock  in the morning.  Because they're all gacked out and drunk.  So he opened up his options, but he says he's not gay.  He's just desperate.  He wants everyone to know, I'm not gay, I'm just desperate. 
[01:32:30]  So he picked up a guy.  A young fella.  Actually, the guy picked him up.  Yeah, yeah, I guess that has to happen, yeah.  He picked up a young fella.  A young fella of 18.  18 or 19, yeah.  A nice, virile young buck.  Irish boy, I remember.  Oh, yes, an Irish boy.  And the kid flipped him over and hit him right in a spider bite.  What?  He got him, I guess, leaning against his bed post.  Well, the pickup was the best, because he wheeled past the deli, and the kids were hanging 
[01:33:00]  out, and Fred comes wheeling up.  Oh, because it was an ad in a magazine.  Right.  He took out an ad in the personal.  It was like, okay, so they hooked up, and they said they were going to meet at the deli.  So Fred's wheeled up to the deli, and the young buck comes walking by, and there's no  mistake in Fred.  In his tight jeans.  In his tight pants.  With his banana poking through.  Did you go to your place, Fred?  Yeah, of course.  I'm right here. 
[01:33:30]  Right.  They went to his place.  I don't know what the hell he said.  Okay.  And then he bent him over.  He bent Fred over.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And had his way with Fred.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then Fred said, and Fred, a direct quote goes, ah, what the hell?  Yeah, he goes, well, you know, ah, what the hell?  So he proceeded to return the favor to the guy.  To return the favor to the guy, I guess, with your face? 
[01:34:00]  No.  He, you went.  No, I don't like the booty.  Hit him in the booty.  In the booty.  In the booty.  Did he sit on your lap in the wheelchair?  He held on to the bedpost, remember?  Oh, so that was when the kid was getting it?  Yeah.  Oh, he's standing over to the bedpost.  And Fred.  No, apparently, Fred, he gutted the guy like a pumpkin.  He had little specks of corn and stuff.  He had to knock out of his Johnson.  I don't got the kid.  So he was all shaky, he was all shaky, holding on with one arm with the bedpost. 
[01:34:30]  Just kind of shaking with all the strength he has in his upper body to hold himself up.  As he was getting the job done.  As he was, yeah, laying some pipe, as they say.  But now Fred doesn't like us exploiting that on the show, I guess.  You don't want people to think you're gay, right, Fred?  No.  The problem was something that I grabbed young boys.  Hey, you sound like a Catholic priest.  What did you go to?  Our Lady at a glory hole? 
[01:35:00]  What's this guy's story?  I heard little boys is all I heard.  Yeah, Fred.  He said three Hail Marys and an Our Father.  Yeah, dirty, filthy little raisin hole.  Bring it over here and let Father wash it off with the bar of soap.  Let me go over here and touch it.  You've been a sinner.  You're a dirty little sinner.  You want some body of Christ?  And Father's going to slip it in you one time.  You filthy little sinner.  Get over here and step in the confessional.  You've been a bad little boy.  Go over here and say your forgiveness. 
[01:35:30]  That's right.  Say it, sonny.  Say it.  Welcome to Our Lady of the glory hole.  Freddie.  Yeah.  One more time.  What did you say?  Your intern said I like boys.  Your, where, where, where, what?  Your intern.  Oh, our intern.  He likes to intern little boys.  I like little boys.  Said you like little boys.  Wait, Stinky's coming in here.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Something's going on here because Stinky just walked in with the biggest smile and he's not 
[01:36:00]  even high.  What is going on with real tear, Fred?  During the break, Ben picked him up to tell him we had to leave, but he asked him a few  questions beforehand.  Ah.  And what was, and what was, uh, one of the questions, Fred?  You're my good boy.  And what did you say?  No way, Ben.  And I take offense to that.  My son, I couldn't take it.  He bent over for an 18-year-old drunken Irish kid, yet he takes offense to what Ben said. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, well, this guy ought to be careful because people are just going to start throwing him  out of the wheelchair and hitting him right in the raisin hole because who the hell is  he going to tell?  Who's going to find out about it?  I was ready for it.  There were 20 of them.  There were 20 of them.  They put it right in my corn chute.  Yeah, you do what you have to do.  You do what you have to do. 
[01:37:00]  Okay.  That's my life.  Fred, you aren't giving oral treats right now, are you?  No, I'm not.  You're actually doing a movie about this guy.  Okay.  My left anus.  My left anus.  That's right.  So, Fred, I guess, have you got any girls, though, lately?  That's the last century.  What?  That's the last century.  That's the last century.  This ought to be a game show. 
[01:37:30]  Figure out what he's trying to say.  What's really saying?  Who can complete the sentence?  We used to play, you know...  I'm doing it very heavy.  What's Fred saying?  We used to play, you know, what is Fred saying?  We might have to bring that back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I'm finding him very hard to understand today.  How would you feel?  We might have to call or something.  All right.  So, what's your problems with the show, Fred?  You don't want to say that you're gay anymore, right?  No, there's no problem with that, but I don't want you to say, like, boys.  All right.  We won't say...  Little boys. 
[01:38:00]  Well, 18 is your limit, right?  Yeah.  Fred, how old are you?  I'm 38.  All right.  38.  So, if you had sex with an 18-year-old kid, that's a little boy, as far as looking at  it.  You're right.  Okay.  You're right.  So, I think Ben is quite accurate by asking you.  Well, I was 36 at the time.  You were 36 at the time.  Okay.  When was the last time you had a guy?  When was the last time you had a guy? 
[01:38:30]  Kyle, we have to have him sing some Louis Armstrong.  I didn't have to go to you, though.  What was that one song?  What was that one song?  Beautiful.  What a beautiful guy.  Yeah.  This guy in Ozzy Osbourne should play Password.  Yeah, really?  That is funny.  I'd like to buy a vowel.  You got to sing some Louis Armstrong, Fred.  Do you know any Louis Armstrong?  Do you know any Louis Armstrong? 
[01:39:00]  Get some oxygen.  That's Jimmy Durante.  Yeah.  That's right.  You knew what he was saying.  That's right.  I used to listen to Jimmy Durante.  I read the book of the week.  I read the book of the day.  I read the book of the hour.  I read the book of the hour.  Ha-cha-cha-cha.  Good night, Miss Calum.  Ha-cha-cha-cha.  Wherever you are.  Yeah.  Freddie.  Yeah.  You got to sing some Louis Armstrong for us today. 
[01:39:30]  I have a song I think.  You'd have to think?  Yeah, I don't think he knows.  I don't think he knows who does.  I don't think he knows who does.  I don't think he knows who does.  Do we have What a Wonderful World anywhere?  You know how tough that is?  Ghost soundtrack.  I don't know what it is.  It's called a few words of it.  I'll pick it up.  It was on the Good Morning Vietnam soundtrack.  Oh, we got that one, I think.  Do we?  I think we have that one.  Yeah.  Earl would know if he was.  All right, Freddie.  So we'll stay away from the gay thing, even though we still want to play your clip. 
[01:40:00]  I'm not gay.  I'm desperate.  That's what he says.  That's true.  All right.  I'd call him a CS-er, but I know he's trying to quit.  And also, I'm hearing you want us to send you money, right?  That would be nice.  But he wants to go down to the brewery.  Do I?  Oh, down to the brewery after we do Sex for Sam, when we go to the Sam Adams Brewery?  Yeah, it would be nice.  Yeah.  You won't be too annoying. 
[01:40:30]  You won't go to try to sit on any bottles, will you?  No.  Thank you, Sam.  No?  Hey, who are you kidding?  This guy could do deep knee bends over a fire hydrant.  He can't feel it anyway.  The thing that I can't feel, I have full sensation down there.  Oh, you have full sensation down there?  Yeah, this guy's leather Cheerio and his baseball hat are the same size, seven and three quarters.  I can borrow some brown.  Hey, well, I don't know what that was.  Hey, Freddie.  You know, it's a shame when you have to...  Hopefully the dumb guy doesn't speak retard. 
[01:41:00]  I'm not retarded.  I just saw something very thirsty.  Hey, Liam, can you read your email, Opie?  What?  He reads your email.  I try to read your email, but it seems like you're writing your email with the palms of your hands.  He actually, he talks the same way he types.  I like you.  I are.  I want to thank you, Opie, for my name. 
[01:41:30]  What?  You made the name Wheelchair Fred.  He's thanking you for calling him Wheelchair Fred.  Right.  Yeah, I named you many years ago, Fred.  Yeah, my name is...  Thank God he wasn't a black guy named Norman.  All right, Fred, I don't know what to do with you.  A lot of people are suggesting we get you a hooker.  We could do that.  Oh, thank you.  I said we get a hermaphrodite.  Let's go to the extra nine yards, just in case.  Can we sneak a hooker into the St. Adam's Brewery? 
[01:42:00]  Sure.  Now, after you just said it?  No, hypothetically.  If we ever really wanted to.  Hey, Freddie, we're going to get a young stud for you.  Oh.  Maybe I'd rather have a couple.  Would you rather have a guy or a girl?  Both at once and couple.  Both at one time, he said.  Don't be greedy.  Mike has a great idea on line 11.  Mike, go ahead.  Yeah, I think for Sex for Sam 3, you should assign a 20-point value to have sex right on Fred's lap. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, man.  We should have Fred just kind of hanging around the area, and if you do something with Fred...  If you have sex with Fred, you get 50 bonus points.  Yeah.  You throw a knuckle up in Fred.  This guy, you just throw a knuckle up in Fred, and the guys can pick up 20 for that.  Right.  But the girls get 50 if they just...  I don't know.  I'm jealous.  I would love to go to your party.  All right.  Well, you're going to be at our party when we're at the Sam Adams Brewery. 
[01:43:00]  All right.  All right, Fred.  I thought I...  All right, Fred.  I think we're going to let you go.  Yeah.  I'm not sending you money, but you can party with us when we're up in Boston.  Freddie, it's nappy time.  Yeah, don't go accidentally wheeling yourself into some guy's mule.  Well, I wouldn't have wanted to come back.  It's the perfect height for that.  Yeah.  Oh, oh.  I got a mule in my mouth.  But this way, if you have to give me some cash to get there... 
[01:43:30]  I'm not giving you.  I'm just bad with direction.  If you just give me some cash to get there...  Oh, now we've got to give him cash to get to the brewery?  Well, all of a sudden...  Start rolling now.  He'll be there by the time we get there.  That was another class move that Dave Dickless used to do with Wheelchair Fred after we left.  They used Wheelchair Fred at our old station.  Yeah.  And they would pretty much exploit him like we do.  Oh, that's how bad this guy... 
[01:44:00]  At least we would get the guy rides home and throw him in a cab and stuff.  He would go to station events and beg for money because he didn't have any money to get home.  And I swear to you, and this was reported in all the papers up there, the local papers,  Wheelchair Fred had a wheelchair himself home one night on the side of a highway.  He was going down like Route 9.  There you go.  That's how Dave Dickless takes care of his people.  Yeah.  Another fine example.  Not to mention, he actually eventually wound up giving Wheelchair Fred his own show. 
[01:44:30]  I would listen to that, though.  I would listen to that.  Oh, sure.  But I, yeah, mid-days and then they doubled you.  I used to go, though.  Hey, Fred, just sing this one verse.  What a beautiful world.  How a beautiful world.  Can you sing, hello, Dolly?  Hello, Dolly.  I said hello.  Dolly, it's so good to see you here today.  Nice to see you here today. 
[01:45:00]  And sleep.  And sleep.  When you woke up, you won't remember any of it.  And wheelchair Fred's sleep.  All right, Fred.  I sound just like Ozzy.  What?  I sound like Ozzy.  You sound like Ozzy.  You make Ozzy look good.  Not for nothing.  I make Ozzy sound good, you're right.  All right, Fred, give me a plug.  Where are you going to be appearing tonight?  At the local Applebee's again?  He's going down to the Mother Road. 
[01:45:30]  It's sleep night.  No, this guy, this guy appears.  You're going to be at the chicken bone?  No, I'm going nowhere tonight.  You're not going anywhere?  Why?  Because I don't want to go.  What?  Because I don't want to go.  Why don't you go to the chicken bone?  How about you just go to the...  Last time he went out, he woke up with a rectum full of man chowder.  So he's a little leery about going out of the house by himself.  I've got a big joke around to myself. 
[01:46:00]  What?  Oh, I heard that one.  I heard that one.  Oh, is that what he's going to do?  That's too much information, Fred.  I don't know if he made the radio, but Fred has a big thing that ladies usually have, and  he'll take care of himself, he said.  What does he have?  Oh, does he have like a...  Oh, yeah.  You know what's so funny?  I was in the bar the other night, and a girl stood up at the end of the bar, this angry  lesbian, and screamed, I can do anything you may. 
[01:46:30]  Tell the buyer a round of the drinks then, honey.  And a pair of...  I got Freddy, I got Freddy.  Hey, Fred, does this device have a name?  It's Big Rubber Thick.  Is it the triple ripple vibrating...  Wait, wait, hold on, what did he say?  He said...  It's Big Rubber Thick.  Wait a minute, Fred, hold on a minute.  That's what I'm saying.  Fred, is it...  Is it...  This thing is just rubber? 
[01:47:00]  Does it have any electronics in it?  No, it's just rubber.  And you...  So, you take it and you put it somewhere, right?  Without...  Let's all be very vague here.  But you take it and you put it somewhere that...  When the doo-doo comes out.  What?  Wait, wait, hold on.  When the doo-doo comes out.  Wait, what are you...  When the doo-doo...  All right. 
[01:47:30]  How old is he, four?  Oh, that didn't make the radio.  All right.  No, that's just...  All right, well, Eddie, that's very funny, but that didn't make the radio.  We know where he puts it, so don't say it.  We know where you put it, man.  But you do that, and as you sit in the chair, or have you just installed it on the wheelchair?  Like a bitch.  Keeps it from falling off when he stops the door.  Like a bitch.  Oh, that's the best. 
[01:48:00]  He never falls out of the seat.  He said...  He said in his bed and in his bathtub.  Oh, in the bathtub.  And you enjoy doing that to yourself, Fred?  Yeah, but you're not gay.  I don't want to leave the bush.  He doesn't want to leave the bush. 
[01:48:30]  Right.  He doesn't want to leave the bush.  I don't love the bush.  Yeah, but is this...  George W. likes you, too.  Is this a device in the shape of a man's unit, though?  Yes.  You're gay.  You're gay.  So it's a floppy, rubber man's mule.  Does it have yam bags attached to it?  Yes.  Oh, you're so gay, bro.  I can pretty much...  I'll accept, because we had this discussion with couples, and guys will argue that it's, 
[01:49:00]  you know, they don't mind this act.  If a girl stimulates certain areas.  With something that doesn't look like a man's unit.  But he's taking this big, rubbery, floppy mess.  Yeah, I mean, you know, I bet you for what it costs for that rubbery, floppy unit, you  could probably pick up one of those pocket pals.  Right.  And take care of the other side.  That's right.  They have those rubber dolls.  I got it for free.  A gay friend got it for me.  A gay friend got it. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, God.  Gave it to you for free.  Did you wash it, Fred?  He's...  He's...  Why am I losing weight?  This guy's...  He's like...  This guy's like John Merrick if he was gay.  I am not an animal!  I am not...  Well, sometimes I am.  I am not on a diet.  Why am I losing weight?  I am an animal.  I'm getting skimier.  My doctor says something about teeth, Sam. 
[01:50:00]  I am an animal.  Oh, man.  So you got it from a gay friend, and you use it...  How often do you use this?  How often a week do you use it?  And why did the gay friend give it up?  He was done with this thing?  Mm-hmm.  This guy goes through those apparatuses like athletes go through sneakers.  You know what I'm saying?  He's going to re-up every three months.  He wears the form off the head.  It becomes just very smooth.  It's like a rubber stick with no... 
[01:50:30]  There's no helmet on it.  When it looks like the Washington Monument, it's time for a little while.  I think it's fresh out of the box.  Wow.  What, Fred?  It's fresh out of the box.  Oh, fresh out of the box.  Fresh out of the box.  Wow.  Pencil in a joke there.  You want to be...  Yeah.  Okay.  Fred?  How often...  I'm just scared of AIDS.  Fred, shut up.  You're scared of AIDS.  Well, sure.  Get 18-year-old guys to bang you if you're scared of AIDS. 
[01:51:00]  Fred, how often do you use this thing?  I'm talking like I'm talking to a dead guy.  Fred's out there shacking up with guys who suck C for drug money.  He's just...  Come on here and, you know...  He's afraid of AIDS.  I'll be at you about once a week.  Once a week?  You use it about once a week?  One night, like Tuesday nights is the night.  He got it from a gay guy who only uses it on Sunday afternoons after church.  Hey, when you're done with it, do you clean it off or just hang it over the door to keep 
[01:51:30]  burglars away?  I clean it off at this point.  Oh, God.  That's awful.  I was in the way to get some real action in this town.  You can't get any real action?  I can't find it.  Yeah.  All right, Fred.  Yeah.  I think we've learned too much today. 
[01:52:00]  Big rubber mule that he's going to use tonight.  Once a week, he uses it.  Not tonight.  Maybe tomorrow.  Oh, why not tonight?  Could I have a pickleball, don't you know?  What?  I have principles.  He has principles?  Yeah.  He only uses it on the Sabbath.  Right.  Yeah.  He doesn't want to be considered a slut.  Fred, how drunk do you have to be before you use that thing?  Yeah, really.  I hardly drink anymore. 
[01:52:30]  What?  He hardly drinks anymore.  Oh, really?  We're thinking...  I'm back on medication.  Yeah?  Suppositories?  They fall out like M&M's out of a bag.  No, AZT.  I'm under AIDS medicine.  It's to control my temper.  Control your temper?  Yeah.  How are you still on Ritlin?  You're angry?  You're on that...  I want to get ripped the radio out of the van. 
[01:53:00]  I couldn't hear that either.  Yeah, I don't know.  I ripped the radio out of the van.  You ripped the radio out of the van?  Oh.  Did you stick it in your balloon nut?  Why did you do that?  What were you mad at?  It was like 95 degrees out.  Yeah.  It was 95 degrees out, so you decided you had to rip the radio out of the van?  I just gave him smoke.  He dropped me off one block from my house. 
[01:53:30]  So you ripped the radio out of his van?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Fred.  He's an angry, angry Fred.  A-N-G guy.  I bet you could open this guy's colon.  It would look like the contents of a shark's stomach, a spare tire, an old license plate.  License plate.  You know.  Kinder boy?  A couple class rings just falling out of there.  Like, you know, a human leg.  You know, just, oh, what's this guy been up to?  Jeez.  One thing you want to realize is I'm very strong upper body-wise. 
[01:54:00]  You're very what body-wise?  I'm strong upper body.  Yeah, he is.  Oh, strong upper body.  This guy's an animal from, like, his nips up.  So he could work a mule like nobody's business.  He's got to reach around, though.  When you have the apparatus, you have to reach around and probably...  Yeah, Fred, how do you work that?  Do you use one hand for the rubber mule, and then the other hand you're taking care of yourself?  No, I use one hand for the mule, and one hand to step on myself. 
[01:54:30]  And your legs just lay there in the way?  No, I've got to pull you to my legs.  He just, uh...  He has a pulley system set up in the bedroom.  He pulls his legs out.  No, I have to go right.  He spreads out the turd...  He spreads out his turd cutter, and he just works the cheek with one hand,  and dips the end of that thing in a vat, a 55-gallon vat of K-Y jelly. 
[01:55:00]  And he's actually ruined the tightness on his raisin.  He has to have, like, a piece of elastic sewed back in there because he stretched it out.  And every time he gets rid of a sewer pickle, his butt's slam shut because he's lost the elasticity in it.  That's all right.  Is that what you're trying to say?  I would say 50% of them probably made it through.  Fred, did you have to have an O-ring put on your balloon nut?  No.  Sorry.  See?  He blew a seal. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  That's what brought the Challenger down.  It was a leaky O-ring.  A leaky O-ring.  So if he could do that to a spacecraft.  Yeah.  Imagine what he could do to...  He blew a seal!  No, I'm not kidding you.  All right.  Fred, we've got to let you go, all right?  All right, I'll let you go.  Fred, we've got to cut you loose.  It's Steve on line four.  Who's the lifeguard when Fred dates up?  What's this?  I need action.  You need action.  I need action. 
[01:56:00]  He sounds like Al Pacino.  Take me your heart.  They pull you back.  I don't bring you like a rock.  I want to make it in London.  And grab the lock.  It's a Burgess murder, ladies and gentlemen.  Burgess murder.  Turn on the break.  Oh, let me tell you, you're a mongrel, kid.  You're a mongrel.  What do you got there?  Is that a roll?  Yeah, I get the bread roll for three grand.  They get the appetizer. 
[01:56:30]  What do you get out of it?  I get the 500.  Shrewd, kid.  Real shrewd.  Rock, spread me out.  So I can take this rubber thing.  Put that boxing glove on and punch me right in my raisin hole.  I got to tell you, I'm going to make it in your face.  Grease me up and chase me around and ring me like a chicken.  I'm going to make it good.  All right, we got to get rid of it, Fred.  Hey, Fred.  I can tell you this.  Hey, Fred, we got a homework assignment for you. 
[01:57:00]  Next time you call in, we want you to sing It's a Beautiful World or whatever that song is.  Wonderful World.  Which Wonderful World?  It's a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong, okay?  Louis, find the lyrics.  You got to find the lyrics.  You can find that online.  Does he have a computer?  Maybe get the song and you can play it and sing along to the record.  You find it and send it to me.  All right, we'll find it and send it to you.  Deal.  Deal.  Done deal.  All right.  Thank you, Fred.  There he goes.  All right.  Thank you, Fred.  God bless you, man.  Fred?  Fred? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, what?  Dude.  Dude, that was...  Come on.  Nothing.  He got me.  Oh, no.  He got me.  Hello, America.  Opie and Anthony want you to vote for boobs.  Wait a minute.  That can't be right.  Vote now for your favorite WOW contestant on opieandanthony.com. 
[01:58:00]  Then, August 8th, Opie and Anthony will announce the top 20 finalists on the Opie and Anthony Show.  1027-WWW.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  23 Skidoo.  Well, we've got to be pretty careful about this next segment. 
[01:58:30]  I don't want to piss off Boston too much today, but the Ted Williams thing is getting out of hand.  Well, apparently his family.  And I was a little sad to hear that Ted Williams passed.  Were you?  No joke.  A little sad.  Yeah.  Well, any time a legend passes on.  The last few years of his life were pretty tough.  I think it's an example to the parents out there that they should treat their kids much better.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  Maybe Ted Williams was a good father and this guy turned out to be a douche anyway.  Could you see Ted being a good father?  This guy, John Henry, one of his sons, has been living off his father's name for many, many years. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  And there's been a lot of, you know, stories that have come out where, you know, he's made Ted's son a lot of bats while he's, you know, retired in his little home there in Florida or wherever he was just to try to make more and more money.  And now this new idea is just ridiculous.  Yeah.  Well, his son, Ted Williams' son, John Henry, has decided he wants his father to be cryogenically frozen. 
[01:59:30]  You know, where they take you and they freeze you, they suspend you in this liquid that freezes you.  Bring you back to life.  Until years and years pass and they come up with a cure for what killed you.  But, you know, when you're that old, what are they going to do?  What are they going to come back to?  Yeah, I know.  Well, the problem is they haven't really figured out how to defrost you where you're going to be okay.  They just think it's going to be, you know what it is?  They think it'll be, we're thinking in terms of today. 
[02:00:00]  If you're frozen and they take you out, the technology we have today, you know, they're looking for the Star Trek type technology.  Where like Bones can take that pepper shaker and wave it over you.  And all of a sudden you're not just cured, but you can get younger or something.  What a scam.  Yeah, it's a total scam.  You want to believe?  You want to believe immortality.  But, you know, there's also the other option that his son is talking about, which is the DNA. 
[02:00:30]  He's saying that if they preserve his head.  Just his head.  That later on.  This is real, right?  This is real.  If they preserve his head.  It says AP next to the story, right?  Right.  AP.  Okay.  You want to hear a clip?  Listen to this clip.  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  And I said, we're not doing anything.  It makes me so sick.  That's the daughter, right? 
[02:01:00]  Right.  The half daughter or something.  She's at odds with the brother because she wants to have Ted's wishes, which were to be cremated.  He was a very private man.  And just the fact that he's part of this spectacle now is probably as in rolling in his cryo chamber.  I thought Ted's wishes were that the Red Sox would win a World Series.  Oh, you got to go there.  Maybe this will be the year now.  They'll rally.  Maybe they'll rally for Ted and Ted can have some influence.  So John Henry wants to preserve the head of his father. 
[02:01:30]  Well, I guess he would like the whole body.  But he'll accept just the head.  Just the head because that's what they do, too.  Get this.  These cryo places, they figure if you can't afford the big chamber for the whole body,  they sell you on the fact that, look, we'll chop off his head and then we freeze the head.  Because in the future, we'll be able to put that head back on something.  We'll clone his body. 
[02:02:00]  We'll have his brain.  See, that's what they get.  We'll have his brain.  Because cloning, if you clone the body, he'll just be a guy going, oh, I'm Ted Williams?  What?  He won't know.  But now they have Ted's brain.  So when their future comes along and they defrost him, he'll be fine.  Can I hear that clip one more time?  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  It makes me so sick. 
[02:02:30]  It's like something out of a zombie movie.  We can freeze his head.  And Fat Bastard is going to show up at the clinic and steal his mojo.  He's got my mojo.  We have another clip of the daughter?  Ted Williams' daughter.  He said that it would be really interesting to sell dad's DNA.  There's a lot of people out there, he said, that would buy dad's DNA. 
[02:03:00]  And there could be lots of little Ted Williams' running around.  This John Henry guy is insane.  First base, Ted Williams.  Second base, Ted Williams.  Third base, Ted Williams.  Catching Ted Williams.  It's right for you.  Ted Williams.  A whole team of Ted Williams.  How great would that be for the Sox?  A whole team of just Ted.  They already have that team.  They're called the Yankees.  Ah.  First base, puns, puns, puns, puns, puns, puns, puns, puns.  F-ing Yankees.  Oh, man. 
[02:03:30]  His head, though.  That's got to be something.  Just freeze the head.  Ted Williams' head, people.  Ted Williams' head.  Now, this is memorabilia at its pinnacle.  All the cards, all the cards I sold over the years ain't nothing compared to sports figure body parts memorabilia.  That's what I'm into now.  And we're starting with Ted Williams' head. 
[02:04:00]  We're going to clone them.  Look, I'm cloning right now in my laboratory.  We're going to clone heads.  Get it on FlexPay.  $1,000.  $1,000.  $1,000.  $1,000.  $1,000.  Cloning with some stronger arteries.  They tend to just bust open on them.  Come on, people.  We got the babes' larynx again.  Up for pids. 
[02:04:30]  I remember that from a few bits ago.  You know, if this guy John Henry could, he would just travel the country with Ted Williams' head in a jar.  Like a pickled punk.  Without a doubt.  He would do something crazy like that.  You know what?  The Sox should sign up Ted Williams' head.  Could you picture it?  Come on.  They just put it out on home plate.  Try to pitch to that.  Ball.  Ball. 
[02:05:00]  Ball.  Well, really can't seem to get a good pitch in on Ted Williams' head.  That's got to be hard.  That one high.  Again, high.  Right up by the eyes, that one.  Playing some chin music.  Just a bit outside.  He tried the corner and missed.  Ted Williams, since coming back to Major League Baseball.  has 175 walks.  Ball.  That one again, high.  And he takes another base on a walk. 
[02:05:30]  They'll roll him down there to first base.  Ted Williams' head.  What a season he's had.  Clemens with the pitch.  Oh, no.  He hit him.  He hit him.  Clemens again with the chin music.  That one gave him a black eye.  But he takes his base.  Look at Ben.  It's disgusted.  Ben is disgusted.  Don't die in Boston, man.  Don't, don't, don't.  God forbid we talk about John Henry wanting to, you know, preserve his father's head.  This isn't coming out of left field. 
[02:06:00]  This is coming from reality.  The guy wants to do this.  Right.  He wants to sell his DNA to sports fans.  We got Lou Gehrig's lymph nodes.  Lou Gehrig's lymph nodes.  You'll be the luckiest man on earth if you get this.  Pardon the pun.  Ted Williams' head.  People, look, look, I got it on my shoulder right now.  I'm the two-headed guy.  You could do this all day with your own Ted Williams' head. 
[02:06:30]  Be the life of the party with Mickey Mantle's liver.  The big sliver.  Just put it in a punch bowl.  It's self-pasting.  Ben laughs at that.  Ben's laughing at the Mick.  Making fun of the Yankees, okay, but not making fun of a red side.  There you go.  Yeah, I see where you are.  What, enough time went by that we can make Mickey Mantle jokes and it's okay?  You douche.  We got Billy Martin's windshield with his face still on it. 
[02:07:00]  Billy Martin's windshield.  Look at his face on it.  It looks like the shrouded Turin.  All right, I'm in.  You got me.  Come on.  We got various Thurman musts in pieces.  Various musts in pieces.  They're pretty tiny.  But we send them there.  You open it up.  You don't even know what you're going to get.  Look, I'm opening up my Thurman box. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, you wrote the same spell.  Look, you don't know what you're going to get.  Look at your tongue.  I got Thurman's tongue.  Limited edition.  Pick your own pieces.  You order enough, you can build your own Thurman.  All the king's horses, all the king's men couldn't put Thurman together again.  But you can if you order now on Fletch P.  It's all about cloning.  Just clone the pieces. 
[02:08:00]  Clone the pieces.  I got a Ted Williams rookie head card.  First edition.  Jim Mintan.  Jim Mintan.  Jim Mintan.  This guy holds the record for walks.  He's never hit a ball since being re-upped with the Sox.  Rookie card.  Ted Williams head rookie.  What are you going to pay for this?  And you could have the head cloned.  That could be rough.  Very limited edition. 
[02:08:30]  Arthur Ashe's T-cells.  Very limited edition.  There ain't many of these people.  Had a hard time finding any at the end.  We got Lyle Alzado's bloated steroid brain pieces.  His brain damn near popped out his head.  He had to keep that bandana around his head because his steroid brain was popping out.  Bobby will eat his finger.  Bobby will eat his finger. 
[02:09:00]  Bobby will eat his finger.  And of course, we got John Crook's cancer nut.  Cloned anyone could have him.  I play ping pong with him with my kids.  Hey, Bob from D.C. once said.  Yes, Bob?  Yeah, I just wanted to let you guys know about the marketing campaign that Boston Red Sox are doing.  It'd be Ted Williams' bobblehead night.  There's a real head.  There ain't no spring, so it just falls off.  Dave Trebekki's arm. 
[02:09:30]  Come on, we got it.  Ted Williams' head's on third.  Oh, boy, Philly.  I think the city's going to start fighting again.  Kobe, what's up?  Ted don't lead much.  Hey, perfect for the Sox.  You put Ted Williams' head at first base, the ball never goes through his legs.  I love Bill Buckner, you Sox suckers.  Oh, boy, the city's going to start fighting.  Hey, Joe, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Lance Armstrong's left nut.  Get it on Flix, baby.  I'll see you guys. 
[02:10:00]  You suck.  Hey, do you have Johnny Moses' legs, Anthony?  We got Will Chamberlain schlock.  Will Chamberlain schlock.  This thing isn't in Jim Minton condition.  Been used a lot.  It's a little frayed.  Hey, Keith wants to make a bid.  Yes, Keith?  Yeah, I want to place a bid on Thurman Munson's altimeter.  Thurman Munson's altimeter.  That comes with a lung.  Look at this coming up for bid now.  Vernon Maxwell's daughter. 
[02:10:30]  Up for bid now.  Let's clone her.  Cut her head off.  We got Payne Stewart's frostbitten toes.  That was a cold flight.  Cold flight to nowhere.  Kind of twilight zone-ish.  Shut up.  No, stop.  Come on.  He was traded like that makes it all good.  Yeah, yeah.  That was very tragic for the Canby family.  That's all I'm saying. 
[02:11:00]  Carson from Waltham.  Jim Abbott's fleshy baby hand.  Maybe the Mets can clone Mo Vaughn when he was good.  We're going to send you Dale Earnhardt.  You want him?  He's yours on Flex Pay.  And the whole thing comes in something the size of a paint can.  You can smell Tiger Woods' fingers.  How about that one? 
[02:11:30]  No one's got to die for that.  Smell the gauge on that finger.  Jason, what's going on?  What's happening, guys?  How you doing today?  Good.  I just wanted to place a bid with you, Don.  I was wondering how much I could get the ball that killed Tony Kinnigliaro.  The ball that hit him on the head.  And the Red Sox do suck.  Later, guys.  Oh, boy.  This could be rough.  Yes, Joe.  I want to put in a bid for the Gale Saints Brian Piccolo backfield. 
[02:12:00]  Yes, Frank.  Yo, what's up, guys?  I just wanted to place a bid on the stuffed Corey Stringer.  You missed the joke.  The life-size doll.  That's what makes it funny.  I'm sorry.  That's Corey's.  All right.  Now we're getting a little rough.  Nathaniel.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Nathaniel.  I'm wondering if you have any of the 1972 Israeli Olympic team left.  All right.  Stop.  Stop.  Paul.  Walt from the city.  Can I bid on Bob Murphy's memory? 
[02:12:30]  It's okay.  I'm not using it.  That was a towering high fly ball deep to center field.  Easily caught to end the inning.  With the score tied at nine apiece, we paused for these words from, what, I'm still in my garage?  Oh, I thought I was watching the game and announcing.  Hey, Mike.  What's going on?  As Ted Williams rolls to second base, we paused for these words from Budweiser. 
[02:13:00]  The King of Beers.  Go ahead, Mikey.  I've got a bid for Donnie Moore's brain matter.  Oh.  And it comes with the second place trophy.  We got George Brant's hemorrhoids that he was so proud of.  Look what I got up on my mantel here.  It's Joe Torrey's prostate.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, I wanted to ask Don West if I could put a bid in on Walter Payton's liver.  Walter Payton's liver.  That thing was ravaged.  Or at the very least, I get Mike Utley's spine.  All right. 
[02:13:30]  Hey, hey.  I want to lend bias his nostrils.  How would you like that Michael Jordan's pop propped up in your own room?  Use his head as a whistle.  It could happen now through cloning.  All the big sports card memorabilia places are selling the cloned sports figures.  It's Tony.  Yeah, I'm looking to buy a Dale Earnhardt skull puzzle. 
[02:14:00]  That's a tough one.  But look, I'm trying to fit the pieces together.  There's a thousand of them.  This is worse than the 3D White House I tried to put together.  It's impossible.  And for Jordan's dad, you could fuse him in your car to get in that H-O-V lane.  It's going to pay for its sale, people.  Joe.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  This one's in mint condition.  It's even still sealed.  It's Roberto Clemente's parachute.  All right.  Argentinian soccer team beef patties. 
[02:14:30]  This stuff isn't that far-fetched if John Henry wants to sell DNA.  Right.  It's Henry Williams.  Yes, Paul.  Yes, how much for real?  Martina never told all of his b****.  I know.  You know what?  I know they dumped out of that, unfortunately.  He wanted to know how much Navratilova.  Navratilova.  Thank you.  Her junk.  Her junk.  Her mule.  Why is someone saying, and cut? 
[02:15:00]  And scene.  Hey, man.  He's walking these days, Brian.  Brian.  Yo.  Hey, what's up?  I want to know if I can get some of Dennis Bird's running shoes.  Change the joke.  Stop it.  He changed the joke on us.  Who wants a flu, Joey Orta?  We got it here.  I cloned it.  All right.  Now we've gone too far.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  I just want to put a bit on, it's not sports related, but Rich Voss is funny bummed because 
[02:15:30]  he ain't using it.  Yeah.  Just when you thought it couldn't get worse.  Matt.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Matt.  I got the Kyle family shattered hopes and dreams.  Oh, okay.  Just punch it out.  I can't take that.  Ooh.  How do we always start with Ted Williams' head and end up in this quagmire?  Pam Anderson doesn't play sports.  Yeah.  Stay with the program. 
[02:16:00]  Stay between the lines, guys.  Let me see.  No, no, no, no.  No, no.  No, no.  That will really piss off, Buffalo.  And we're going there Saturday.  That is horrible.  You are the worst.  That.  That will get a Buffalo.  Let's save that for after we get back from Buffalo.  How's that?  He wouldn't need a Dunn's cap.  All righty. 
[02:16:30]  Well, I guess, I guess that's it.  Whew.  Why don't we go to break with some classic Bob Murphy?  The pitch.  High fly ball.  It leads to left center field.  It's way back.  It may be playable.  Agbayani can't get a play.  It's gone.  A home run.  Oh, he caught it.  He caught it at the wall.  I was sure he was unable to reach it.  It's caught by Agbayani.  I apologize.  He was way out there, and it didn't look like he had a play on it.  But he caught it against the wall in left center field.

Then, August 8th, Opie and Anthony will announce the top 20 finalists on the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW. 
[02:17:30]  Hey, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  In studio, Christopher Titus.  Hello.  If you're a circus freak, call in.  We'll help you through it.  Yeah.  For our counseling sessions that we're having now.  Hey, the 97-year-old guy didn't sing.  And Jimmy got it.  When he was doing that, did he?  We gave her the rape hotline and the geriatric rape hotline.  Yeah, right?  I blame Viagra.  Right.  You popped three at one time, my friend.  You're going after anybody.  You get a 97-year-old guy that does Viagra. 
[02:18:00]  All of a sudden, his junk starts working.  What do you think?  What do you think?  He's going to look at a 97-year-old woman and go, let's get it on.  Exactly.  First of all, there ain't no woman Viagra.  So that thing is just like a desert.  Right.  So he figured that this 12- and 13-year-old girl will be the one.  Well, he shouldn't have gone all the way to the other end of the spectrum, you know.  Get a nice spring chicken of 55 or something.  A lot of people don't know what they do when they wake up after the Viagra.  They're not sure.  Right.  Maybe all the blood rushed out of his head, and he just went wild.  Now, before they had Viagra, I'm hanging out with my dad at the Oakland Rosa show. 
[02:18:30]  We're walking around.  He's married to this new woman.  And we're walking around, and he's going, he had to shoot a needle into his.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm telling you.  No, hold on, hold on.  We're just cleaning it up, because they dumped out of that.  I don't know why.  Believe me.  What?  Believe me.  We understand.  It makes no sense.  You should be able to say that, because it's a medical thing.  What did I say?  And that's what he had to do.  Put the needle into his.  He did.  My father had to get.  But you can't say the P word for the guy's thing.  You could say mule.  We say yam bag.  We say junk.  You got it. 
[02:19:00]  So here's the thing.  My dad's junk is not working as well as it should be, because he had a couple of heart  attacks, four.  Actually, they actually.  Your dad had four.  Yeah, they actually revoked his organ donor card.  Oh.  Yeah.  So he's talking to me.  What's he talking?  He's the father-son talk, which is freaked me out.  I'm walking around the Oklahoma street, and he goes, he's going, yeah, so before the  Viagra thing, I had this needle, and he had to shoot it.  And he goes, one day, he goes, I figured, they give me, they say, 10 cc's, you shoot in.  And I figured, so my dad goes, shoot in right, right, right into the, yeah, the junk.  Yeah, into the junk.  And he goes, he goes, I think 10 cc's, 10 cc's is supposed to what I'm doing.  The doctor says, don't use any more 10 cc's.  Well, I'm thinking, you know, I want to perform for the new lady. 
[02:19:30]  Can I slow you down a little bit?  Yeah.  Because I don't get it.  So, what?  So before Viagra.  But what do you, oh, before Viagra, there was something you could.  Yes, my dad got married to this woman, right?  Right.  And he wanted to make sure she was.  But what does this stuff do?  It does what Viagra does.  Yeah, yeah.  No, actually, I think it took the, it probably takes the place of the blood that would normally go there to put it in the state.  No, it was a chemical.  It was something because it, whatever, it constricted everything so it would, so it really, so his junk would expand.  Hey, is that good? 
[02:20:00]  I did this.  Yeah, that's good.  That's good.  All right, go ahead.  I'm just getting a needle.  So walking around the road to show where my dad's talking to me, he goes, he goes, yeah, just like tossing it off.  He goes, so I'm going to use it right.  And he goes, I figure 10 cc, they said, you know, 10 cc is my normal.  I'll do 30 cc's.  So my dad's junk turned, he goes, he goes, my junk turned black?  And he goes, and it took 11 hours.  11 hours to go down.  And I'm literally like just boat over laughing. 
[02:20:30]  That's funny.  I couldn't imagine having to put a needle.  No.  No, you got a bit more of a feeling.  Don't you get that feeling down there when somebody even talks about it?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, ah.  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't imagine any woman looking across from going, you know, you are so sexy.  Give me my syringe.  Yeah, yeah.  See how important it is?  Let's do it.  What?  See how important sex is to guys?  If you're willing to take a needle and jam it into your junk, it's a pretty important thing.  Exactly.  It's fair perspective for all the ladies out there.  Hey, what happened to Happy Face? 
[02:21:00]  He was calling back at the commercials and no Happy Face.  Diced down at a ground zero.  We're a little distracted, Christopher Titus, because Dice called all emotional.  He wasn't ready to, he wasn't in the right state of mind to be on our show and we wanted  to know what that was all about.  Oh, it was at ground zero.  Then we found out he was going down to ground zero.  We want to see how that went for him.  I'm just imagining the guys that are down there now working are probably like, all right,  you know, De Niro was here a few months ago and we just really want to pave this road  and get this done and, you know, enough with the visits.  Enough with the visits, yeah. 
[02:21:30]  We're doing our job and, you know, enough with the visits.  Yeah, well, it just becomes a little more about the personality that's going down there  than it does about ground zero.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, if you want to go down and not tell the press you're going, I kind of buy that you  want to see it.  But if you're going, hey, you know, tell everybody no, you're going out of ground zero.  It's not as, not as, I think he's paying his respects, but it's a little, a little weird.  You think he, you think he got a tear up when he's looking around?  Of course he did. 
[02:22:00]  Hey, I'm getting a little choked up over here.  I have no problem admitting it.  I went down there.  I bawled.  It's just amazing.  Well, we were in L.A.  Here's what pissed me off about it is that people in L.A. were like, I'm not going to  work.  Really?  You're in L.A. and you're not going to work?  Yeah.  Look at the people, the people there that were at happened are busting their ass.  Yeah.  You know, you know, don't, don't let these people.  Why isn't L.A. going to work?  Huh?  No, they had happened.  Like, I called the crew, you know, I talked to my partners and they said, what do you  want to do?  I said, well, I think these guys are putting out fires and saving lives.  We should probably keep going.  Don't let these terrorists win and all. 
[02:22:30]  You know, and what the hell's going on with terrorists?  You know, you know, any country that doesn't listen to their, their women is going down.  Because you know, Dan, where there was some chick that was, oh, was serving them food  while they were planning that thing.  And she, pardon me, what did you say?  You're going to what?  No, don't yell at me.  Okay.  When your ass got lost in the desert last year, who got you to Jalalabad?  That was me, my friend.  And, you know, okay, I'll say that before you hit me with a stick, but I want you to  know I only made you cold sandwiches because you won't let me learn to read a freaking recipe  book.  See, that's another problem they got.  This whole sex angle.  Yeah.  Right? 
[02:23:00]  They cover their women up, they put them in their robes, and they don't get to look  at attractive women.  No, they don't get to look at attractive women.  I think that loosens you up a little bit.  I think so.  You know what?  If you're getting your junk waxed, is that okay?  Very good.  I'm doing what I can't do.  You guys are the toughest, edgiest radio station in the country.  Get your junk waxed.  I know.  That's silly.  I know.  Hey, Dice on the phone.  We used to say.  Dice on the phone.  Listen to Dice.  Oh, Dice.  Dice.  Well, actually, it's happy face in there.  Hang on, hang on. 
[02:23:30]  See, happy face has to call for Dice.  Happy face calls for Dice.  Hang on.  Now he's getting the legend.  What a crappy phone.  This gets so freaking old after a while.  Who's happy face?  Dice.  Happy face is the guy that makes the call for the legend, and then he gets us on the  phone, and then he hands the phone over to the legend.  It's like a secretary, huh?  I was on Dice's show, by the way.  Dice's show.  Remember the show he did where he was a radio executive?  Oh, I mean a record company executive?  Oh.  I'm ready to present you with the legend.  All right, I'm ready.  Present.  Present.  Okay, here he is. 
[02:24:00]  Are you ready?  Okay, here we go.  Hold on.  He was so close to hanging up.  Yes, Andrew.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Do you understand that I'm here with the Salvation Army?  Yeah.  Who's been here since day one at Ground Zero taking care of things?  Right.  And you're bothering me with this nonsense?  Yeah, Dice, we realize that.  We've been here since September 11th.  Do you understand that there's nowhere in New York you could go without getting a ticket now?  What's that?  I'm with the police sergeant and he told me so. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, sure.  What day is this?  October 1st?  I got the complete police department looking for you.  It's September 30th or something.  All of a sudden, Dice is down there.  Dice.  Yeah.  You could have visited a lot sooner than this.  The entire police department is looking for you guys.  Right.  Right as we speak.  What is he talking about?  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  You're losing us.  What are you doing?  Wherever you park. 
[02:25:00]  What are you doing down there?  You're ticketed.  Whatever you walk, you get ticketed.  What are you doing down there?  Do you understand how it works?  I'm going to put on special police operations lieutenant.  See how he goes.  Wincloth.  See how he goes.  He just keeps going.  You hear what I'm saying?  Not at all.  Dice.  Dice.  You hear me?  Everyone knows we're pretty tight with the NYPD.  Yeah.  I don't think Andrew Dice Clay is going to change our relationship with the NYPD.  I think it's already been changed my friend.  I got it under control.  I got a hat.  Dice.  Give me a hat. 
[02:25:30]  Do you understand?  Dice.  Yeah.  What are you doing down there?  I want to put the lieutenant on.  Why don't you let the guys work?  Yeah.  I want him to talk to you.  No, don't put the lieutenant on.  Why don't you just let the guys do their job?  What are you doing down there?  Because he says you're getting a ticket now.  What are you doing down at Ground Zero?  What am I doing down there?  Why don't you let the guys do their job?  I'm a lieutenant.  That's who I'm with.  I got the hat now.  I got the hat.  You understand?  You don't have the hat.  Let the guys do their job.  They've seen enough disaster down there. 
[02:26:00]  I'm with the Salvation Army.  Right.  I'm with the lieutenant.  And I got the hat.  Okay.  I think you're the last celebrity to get an NYPD hat, by the way.  Holy ass.  I have to see another celebrity with an NYPD hat.  You have the FDNY hat, too?  Nice.  Stay there.  I'm all set now.  You have the FDNY hat?  I have to see another Asian guy that's obviously not on the job with an NYPD hat.  I'm going to kill myself.  Did they give you a patch with the towers and never forget? 
[02:26:30]  I got to talk to somebody right now.  I'm going to put happy on for a second.  No, don't put happy on for me.  Dice.  Put down for me.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  What happened?  He's having a nervous breakdown, I think.  Happy face.  Yeah, this is happy face.  Where is the legend?  The legend is taking care of meeting and greeting people.  Meeting and greeting people.  Do you understand that he's a legend and everybody wants to shake?  Absolutely.  There must be at least nine people there.  Absolutely. 
[02:27:00]  There are literally hundreds of people here right now taking pictures of his chiseled chin,  admiring his dimples, and just wanting to touch his body.  Because he is a legend.  Do you understand that?  Why do you need to go with Madison Square Garden?  Look at Christopher's face.  He has sold out Madison Square Garden.  Why is this looking like Jesus Christ?  Did he sell it?  Right.  He has played every major arena in the country.  Did he sell Madison Square Garden?  He has the olive garden.  He has paper new special gifts.  It's the garden.  Did he sell it?  Madison Square Garden.  This is why he's a legend.  Christopher, stay human, okay?  See, this is your future if you start to, uh, happy face. 
[02:27:30]  Start believing your own face.  Oh, happy face hung up.  He got a little upset.  All right, Rick.  Call back happy face.  We need Dice to talk because now Barry Williams is on the other line.  Barry Williams?  Yeah.  Yes.  Did anybody do this?  No, no.  It's Greg Brady.  I know.  But he's the guy who failed.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, we got to talk to that.  Wasn't that great?  That was great.  Hey, Greg Brady.  Barry.  Hey.  The legend there?  No.  The legend is meeting people now.  He's meeting and greeting.  He's meeting and greeting in the middle of Ground Zero. 
[02:28:00]  We're very close to getting both of you on the phone at the same time.  I have a spectacular offer for him.  Yeah, so you could ask Dice if he wants to be part of the next celebrity boxing thing.  He's got to get in the ring.  Barry wants Dice to fight a chick.  Well, not just a chick.  Who, who, who, who?  China.  China.  Oh, oh.  From the WWF.  All right, hold on.  We might have Dice back on the line here.  She goes for the junk, though.  Oh, yeah.  She does that punch.  She does, man.  Dice.  Dice.  No, this is Happy Face.  It's not Dice.  Happy, put on Dice, please.  I can't.  He's a legend.  He's taking care of things. 
[02:28:30]  You understand that people want to meet him?  No.  No, see, obviously, you guys, you see, you see, this is the problem.  I got, you know, I just can't.  I can't.  I can't.  I got to go.  Happy Face.  Happy Face.  He's hanging up now.  He's hanging up now.  Oh.  Dice is hanging up.  I can say, I mean, I can't be sure, but he's got to know I'm on the line.  He's got to know this offer's coming.  And maybe he's ducking it.  Yeah, one more time, Rick.  That's it.  That's what he's using.  Tell Happy Face that Barry Williams, the real Greg Brady, wants to make Dice an offer. 
[02:29:00]  We're trying to help Dice out.  Come on.  Yeah, like they helped Vanilla Ice out, the last celebrity boxer.  Right.  Like they helped.  The last celebrity down at Crown Zero.  Who knew that Vanilla Ice couldn't fight?  What are you talking about, Willis?  Do you see him bouncing around like a dober?  He thought he was in the prison shower again.  He was fighting for his manhood.  Barry, did you watch it?  I mean, I tuned in late.  I didn't get to see you and Danny, but Danny.  Barry was too busy at the hospital trying to wake up.  But that ain't fair, though, because Bonaduce is training like every day.  I did like the other half like two weeks before.  But Barry's a friend of ours. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, he's a martial artist.  You should have some fun with that.  He's a martial artist.  I wouldn't go in the ring with Don.  Bonaduce?  No way.  All that anger from his career and then on top of knowing martial arts.  You know what else he did?  He stopped taking his mood-elevating drugs about three weeks before.  Oh, he did.  He was totally zoned.  He pulled a Tyson.  Because we were talking.  A buddy of mine is a martial arts instructor and trained me.  And, man, I got to tell you, man, I don't know if I'd have stepped in the ring with him.  You had a lot of guts, man.  A lot of guts.  Who knew Greg Brady?  Johnny Bravo.  They kept a couple secrets.  Johnny Bravo.  Do you hate being called Greg Brady, man?  Does it just bug you?  No, I prefer Keith Partridge. 
[02:30:00]  We have Christopher Titus in the studio, Barry.  Yeah, I know.  I have a fan.  Yeah, I wasn't sure.  Me too, man.  I mean, you know, I grew up on you.  Barry has fully accepted the fact that he will...  I've embodied it.  Yeah.  And he's actually done a great job having fun with it.  He put out an album with Johnny Bravo.  Yeah.  A Johnny Bravo album, which we played...  It's part of what I'm touring with right now.  Yeah.  Excellent.  Now, Barry, do you put the jacket on, the little vest? 
[02:30:30]  I do when I do Johnny's back and the shades.  Johnny's back.  All right.  I'm ready to rock your town tonight.  Yeah.  I can't get the picture of Dice out of my mind.  With the big NYPD hat on.  The last guy.  Actually, he's the second to last, because I believe Caratop is going to make his way down  to ground zero to complete the entire celebrity gamut.  All right.  At least Emo Phillips went early.  Dice.  Who do you want?  What happened?  We want Andrew Dice Clay, please.  You want the American legend? 
[02:31:00]  Yes.  We need him to speak with Barry Williams, who is on the phone with us right now.  Happy Bates, we'd like to speak to the funniest comic of all time, the American legend, Andrew  Dice Clay.  All right.  You see, other people know he's a legend.  I'm telling you.  All right.  We're not denying it, man.  Let's all calm down.  We're trying to do a radio show here, and we've got to move on.  The legend of Pips.  Let's get...  Okay.  Well, hang on.  The legend just may be ready now.  Hang on.  All right.  Okay, here he is.  Oh, thank God.  Andrew Dice Clay.  O.P.  Dice.  O.P., do you understand?  I'm on with Tom Kennedy. 
[02:31:30]  We're talking about hats.  We're saying I'm over here.  This is how friendly we are.  He's over somewhere, and I'm over here.  Oh, my God.  And we talk like that to each other.  Can just please...  And he's going, I don't see...  Please, can I pray, please, can one more piece of debris just fall?  Something that was precariously perched on the top of one of the buildings that...  Please, one more piece of debris.  One brick.  That's all we need.  Very well...  I don't see ONA walking around with the hat.  Hey, Dice. 
[02:32:00]  Dice.  I went down to ground zero three weeks after the event by myself in the middle of the night.  No one knew I was there.  Says to me, we give you the hat.  Oh.  Not ONA.  He's going with the hat.  All right, Dice.  We have great...  Tom Kennedy gave me the hat with the lieutenant.  I understand.  Dice, we have the real Greg Brady on the line.  Right.  Barry Williams from...  You remember Barry?  Yeah, I love Barry.  He's very nice.  With a proposition for you and your fine career.  But the thing is, with Barry, he don't got the hat either. 
[02:32:30]  Right.  I don't see him down here.  You know, the hat bit's a little old.  I'm going down here with Tom Kennedy and the lieutenant.  All right.  We understand.  Dice.  Dice.  Here's Barry Williams, Dice.  Let me talk to you for just a second.  The hat's not the closer.  First of all, I've been down a free time.  I'm talking about something.  Listen, it's a very patriotic thing that you're doing down there.  Now, when you think about what went on, it gets you mad, doesn't it?  Who am I talking to?  Barry Williams, you dick.  That one has even said. 
[02:33:00]  I'm not in show business right now.  Right now, I am down.  Stop listening.  I'm down zero with the lieutenant.  In the hat.  I know.  In the hat.  The whole Kennedy clan is it.  Karlochewski.  Well, whatever.  Look, I know a lot of the people that work down at the site at Ground Zero.  I know a lot of them listen to the show.  Could you please, one of the crane operators, could you just lower something heavy on dice?  Please, right now.  He's standing right there. 
[02:33:30]  Lower one of those big toolbox things.  One of those big wrecking balls.  Just drop it on dice.  Please drop it on dice.  Or pick him up and dump him in the river.  Could you just dump him?  Move the boom on over.  Dump him in the Hudson.  Could you please just dump him in the river?  Just lift him up in the air a few hundred feet.  Please.  Make it look like an accident.  Barry.  Barry.  Barry.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Barry Williams.  Please speak with Andrew Dice Clay. 
[02:34:00]  Dice, I just want to say, I think it's great what you're doing down there, but it has to  get you mad when you think about what happened.  It doesn't get you mad when you think about what happened.  They're calling you with an offer.  It gets us mad that the Port Authority Police Department doesn't get enough.  Oh, who is this now?  Much work we've been doing down here.  Oh, Christ on a pony.  Where is Dice?  Get Dice.  Dice is standing by with us, shoulder to shoulder with the Port Authority Police Department, sir.  Why do you have to be on the phone to try to get more credit?  We all know the Port Authority, you know, lost. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, I hate this crap.  Get Dice on the phone.  All right.  All right.  Calm down, man.  Dude, let it go for a second.  Get this putz off and put somebody on who's reputable, okay?  Then I'll put Dice on.  Get Dice on the phone.  Put Dice on the phone.  I'll explain in a minute.  I'm so sick of people that are pissed off because they're not getting enough credit.  Well, that's it.  With this whole Ground Zero thing and the terrorist attacks.  I know.  That's not credit, sir.  It's simply a matter of getting the information out.  I'm going to put Dice on, and then I'm sending 20 cops down to lock your ass up. 
[02:35:00]  Put Dice on.  I don't understand why you have to call to try to get credit for a job that you're doing.  Obviously, I should be the one that's the mayor at this point.  Oh, God.  I can make a visit down here.  I'm coming down with this.  Make him the mayor, and then please, can we have the first mayor of New York assassinated?  Please.  I'm coming down with 20 cops.  It's making a year for my family.  Dice.  And you're going to get frisked and sentenced.  Dice.  What do you think?  I'm a moron. 
[02:35:30]  Barry, Barry.  Yeah, yeah, I'm here.  Instead of trying to get him in the spirit of it, I think you're going to have to go directly  to the offer.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Nobody believes in it.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  I am there with the Kennedys and the Louis Henners.  Oh, my God.  Dice, they have a very way up as an offer for television for you.  Money.  I'm here with the Kennedy and Winslow.  Help your fame.  There will be money.  And Winslow.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  He's my superior.  He is my answer to it.  Dice.  Oh, my God. 
[02:36:00]  Dice.  Christopher Titus here.  Dice.  Who's there?  Christopher Titus.  How you doing, man?  Yeah.  You are no cop.  I am a police general officer.  I get it, man.  Look, Barry Williams has an offer.  He's having a nervous breakdown.  He is definitely having a nervous breakdown.  We are listening to Dice in the midst of a nervous breakdown.  Let's all just sit back and listen.  Perhaps seeing Ground Zero was the last straw.  Snap him like a twig.  I have work to do in the city.  I drive around in a rink in old school. 
[02:36:30]  Dice, you're having a nervous breakdown.  Seek help.  You don't even know what you're talking about.  I will arrest you and put you in jail, and I will have Lieutenant Winslow send you with  the Judge Kennedy.  You understand what I can have done now?  Dice, you're a madman.  Where is Bloomberg?  Where is bad back Bloomberg?  I want to talk to the mayor.  You know what I mean?  I'm seeing sodas down here.  I'm seeing open bottles of water.  I want to see good stuff.  I highly recommend you see Dice at the Beacon Theater tonight, because I truly believe 
[02:37:00]  it will be the last time he'll be on a stage.  We're not entertained the boys anymore.  Dice, Dice, I think...  Shaking their boobs.  I think hawking for the workers down there is pretty much done with.  You know, they're getting everything they need.  Maybe if you were there in October, maybe if you were in New York during the event, and  in the months following it, you would understand what was going on, instead of being the self-centered  guy that you are.  Shaking people, I am running this city now. 
[02:37:30]  I will bring this city back to the greatness that we once were.  Hey, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, why didn't you just wait till the buildings were built  back up?  Why didn't you wait till they just built the buildings again?  And then show up.  I am so glad.  Lieutenant Bloomberg and Captain Lieutenant Winslow.  Hey, Dice, why don't you go to Pearl Harbor?  I hear something horrible happened there a while ago. 
[02:38:00]  Help those people.  You live in the land, man, world.  Jesus, Dice, go to Cape Canaveral.  I hear one of the shuttles exploded.  Go down there and pay your respects.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Holy Christ, what is he talking about?  On the air, as long as you abide by the rules of my people who work on the main, the police  people in the sea.  Dice, Dice, go to the harbor.  The Titanic was supposed to come in, but it sank.  Pay your respects. 
[02:38:30]  There's nothing here.  Hey, these people need warm clothes.  The survivors of the Titanic, they need warm clothes.  Help them out here.  I'm here with the people from White Star Lines.  The White Star Lines people had a hard time.  Their ship sank, and these people to survive is a cold.  They need blankets.  Send them down there.  I'm going to Jersey.  I'm going to Lakehurst, New Jersey.  I hear a blimp exploding.  The people are hurt.  They need help and support. 
[02:39:00]  The Hindenburg.  Oh, the humanity.  I can't look.  Holy Jesus.  My God.  It's unbelievable.  That was...  Uh, Barry?  Uh, yeah.  All right.  We were close that time.  We should mention...  We were close.  We were pretty close.  This might not be the most opportune moment.  I'm not sure.  He has lost his mind.  He's having...  Mary's cow burnt down Chicago.  Please, people need homes.  Please, people need homes.  By the way, I don't...  Typhoid Mary's killing everyone. 
[02:39:30]  By the way, I don't want anyone to confuse what I was saying.  But it really pisses off, Ant and I, when people feel like they have to call the media,  you know, radio stations, TV, to try to get more credit.  We understand the tragedy.  Believe me.  What to...  Believe me.  And this isn't the first or second time this has happened, you know?  Yeah.  So, if you were for the Port Authority, it wasn't a stab at you, but I can't believe  the guy's, you know, calling and trying to get more credit for the Port Authority.  The Midwest is in a dust bowl.  They're in a dust bowl.  They need our help. 
[02:40:00]  It's a big drought.  Hey, Dice, I hear there's a hurricane coming off of Florida.  Yeah, it's Hurricane Andrew.  Please hurry.  Help.  I don't think anybody doubts your respect for the Port Authority.  Dracatoa, it's erupting.  The people of Pompeii, they're all stuck in a rock over here.  Oh, my God.  They need your help.  At least you made it funny.  I got the hat.  I got the Mount St. Helens hat. 
[02:40:30]  Run for your lives, people.  Run for your lives.  Mount St. Helens erupted.  Run for your...  Look, I got the Washington State Police hat.  I'm here with Officer Kennedy.  Mount St. Helens, run, people.  Look at the ash.  I'm the biggest ash here.  I'm an ash hole.  Well, you know, he's a fellow comic, people.  I'm just going to say the question.  Of course.  No, as a fellow comic, everyone could go find dice.  But he's...  I've never heard him that out of his mind. 
[02:41:00]  He is completely...  He lost his mind somewhere.  Yeah.  Christopher, has it been going for a while?  Yeah, yeah.  Ever since we've been doing this program.  Wow.  He's lost his mind somewhere.  Wow.  Remember, he come up on stage, you know, hickory, hickory, dog.  You know, he do his things, and his cigarette smoke.  I'm on the line with this chick at the bank, and she's got a tongue.  Oh!  Yeah.  Now, he does what you just heard.  He babbles, incoherent.  That's a show?  You don't even know what he's talking about.  Yes! 
[02:41:30]  Oh, you guys aren't actually helping the ticket sales at the Beacon Theater.  No, no, absolutely.  The place where we pay tonight, because it could be his last show ever.  Because you will see a man having a nervous breakdown tonight.  You will see a man having a nervous breakdown at the Beacon.  I know MTV wants to take advantage of that whole Ozzy Osbourne show.  Kennedy's been shot!  Kennedy's been shot!  MTV should follow dice around with cameras.  There's your next hit, I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  See the real dice when he's not on the stage.  It's kind of sad. 
[02:42:00]  Greg Brady.  I think the first episode should be down at Ground Zero with him, then.  Oh, man.  That seems to be a touchstone for him.  Barry.  Next album.  Ground Zero with dice.  I think that's the next album.  All I could do is apologize, Barry.  I actually thought, silly me, please hit me with a goddamn ball-peen hammer in the head.  I thought he would shut up for enough time where you could actually get a word in, Edwin.  At least fill out the offer.  Yeah, and we all, we definitely don't want to ever forget what happened. 
[02:42:30]  Right.  But I felt like it was like October 1st.  A little self-serving.  For the last half hour.  Yeah.  I've been sitting over here thinking maybe Christopher would like to put on the gloves.  Man, you know what?  I still have a show.  It's not a has-been, Barry.  I still have a show on television, right?  Maybe after.  Whoa, man.  Ten years.  No, no, no.  Ten years from now.  Let's talk.  Because, you know.  My career is on fire again now.  It is, man.  You handled it well, dude.  He was, he's like a fighter.  Yeah, Barry.  He did a good job, man.  That's not a lot.  More people call me Barry now than ever in my life.  That's true, right? 
[02:43:00]  That's a few, Ant.  That's not a low blow.  I wish I had half the career you had, my friend.  Yeah.  And half the gash.  That's right.  My God.  He got some Marsha Brady.  All right, Doc.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Barry, do we hang up on you?  And if we get Dice back, do we try to call you?  I don't know.  I'll be lifting with bated breath.  All right.  All right, go get a hat.  The hat's still there.  Christopher, we should talk.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  All right, man.  Thank you, Barry.  See you, guys.  All right.  It's like the hat got one laugh, and then he just couldn't. 
[02:43:30]  And then he, that's what he does.  Oh, my God.  The hat got a laugh, and it's like to stay up.  He wants to annoy you.  You should have seen him.  You should see him.  If you go to the beacon tonight, he will go up to some guy and go,  Look, what color pants you're wearing?  Beige?  And then he'll go off for 20 minutes on the guy's beige pants.  Because beige is.  You want to run up onto the stage and punch him in the face.  Wow.  Punch me.  By the way, this is the guy who's like on your team.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Isn't that sad?  I'm glad I'm not.  I'll be calling you like three years crazy from L.A. 
[02:44:00]  Insane.  Just ranting.  Insane.  Dice having a nervous breakdown.  And this just in, Dice is jumping on a plane.  He's going to go to Oklahoma City.  I hear they had a problem with a building.  It blew up.  There was people.  Oh, save the children.  Save the children.  I'm asking everyone, send diapers for the children.  And then he's heading over to Columbine.  Oh, my God.  There's a problem there.  We got to save the kids.  I got a hat.  That makes everything okay, I think. 
[02:44:30]  I'm looking for the Lindbergh baby.  I'm looking for the Lindbergh baby.  Charles Lindbergh needs help finding the baby.  There's a ladder out his window.  Someone stole his baby.  He's an American hero.  I got a Lindbergh hat.  I got a Lindbergh.  Oh, man.  Well, uh.  The redcoats are coming.  The redcoats are coming.  Oh, two if I land, one if I see, three if I had. 
[02:45:00]  God damn, Dyche, man.  Nothing funny than him losing his friggin' mind.  Engines are coming.  Custer, look out.  Watch your scalp, Custer.  You daffy bastard.  You put your hat on.  Put your hat on.  So they can't scalp you.  Hey, it's Dyche here.  No, don't worry.  It's no Trojan horse or nothing.  Dyche here, open the door.  Open the door. 
[02:45:30]  I got a hat.  It's the Trojan hat.  Well, I hear Rock Hudson is sick, huh?  What is it, a flu?  He's got the flu bug.  Oh, wow.  So I'm watching him have a nervous breakdown.  It's perfect.  Hey, Kennedy, talk.  Kennedy, look out.  I think, wow.  Hey, Adam, that was really fun. 
[02:46:00]  It was a lot of fun.  You got it when you're hearing somebody actually having a nervous breakdown.  To wrap it up, go right to the beginning.  Hey, Adam, don't eat that apple.  Adam, what are you doing?  He's going to bite it and we'll have internal damnation or something.  He's the snake.  He's the snake.  Don't listen to the snake.  Snake.  Cut the snake.  I'll make the skin into a hat.  Eve, what a hoo-er.  Yes.  She's a hoo-er.  She's going to ruin it for everybody.  Hey, Noah, build the ark.  It's raining. 
[02:46:30]  It's going to be drowning here, people.  Put on a rain hat.  All right, man.  That was probably one of the best improv radio bits I've seen.  Thank you, Chris.  I've done a lot of radio, man, and that was really funny.  And it's sad that I wasn't involved in it.  Moving on.  Whatever.  Well, what happened?  Is he on medication?  Did he leave?  Should be.  What happened?  The guy should be.  Guys, I'm not kidding.  I'm like, he's a fellow of comics.  I'm like, dude, what happened?  I'm so glad you know this. 
[02:47:00]  I need some Paxil.  Maybe some Thorazine.  I think he's convinced it's funny or something.  We don't know.  We don't know what he's done.  We don't understand what he's going for.  And, Christopher, we've talked about this.  Repeating the same joke over and over.  Yeah.  It's not funny.  It's Vaudeville.  Right.  Vaudeville.  Vaudeville.  We've talked about this.  I don't mean to rip dice, but, I mean, it's like.  Right.  We've talked about this, though.  Me and Opie sit there and go, why does he call up and just go on and on and not stop?  No matter what you say.  You go, okay, guys, we got it.  But let's talk about this. 
[02:47:30]  He didn't have it.  He keeps going.  Listen, you want to reach into the phone and pull his head out and punch him.  And someone has a Big Bang joke on like that.  That's great.  What are you doing?  Big Bang.  Big Bang.  And they made the universe.  It's in constant motion.  It ain't ending.  You know, because you could say, if it's never ended, what's at the end of it?  Let's say there's a hat. 
[02:48:00]  What's beyond the hat?  Another hat.  Oh!  Anthony.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Oh, man.  He's like freaking the Nostradamus of comedians.  He's doing comedy in Quatrain.  Isn't he amazing?  But it's the same Quatrain over and over.  We're hanging with Christopher Titus.  Man.  Very funny, guys.  This has been the oddest.  I've never.  It's just been an odd show.  You guys should probably have a girl that's been molested by this 97-year-old guy. 
[02:48:30]  We have Dice flips out on the phone.  Dice having a nervous prank.  You know, trust me, the show's funny.  Maybe you didn't hear it today, but I promise.  You know what?  Ask.  He saw it.  He saw it.  Very funny.  We might have to replay what we did to Linda Lovelace's older sister.  Oh, jeez.  Please.  We forgot that happened today.  Right.  Christopher Titus coming in.  More tragedy.  More tragedy and painful yelling.  Come on.  Every time I'm talking.  No, not at all.  You're having fun, right?  Oh, yes.  All right.  That's all that matters.  Hello, America.

[02:50:00]  How you doing?  What's up, Dice?  I'm very busy.  Baby Jessica is caught in the well, and I got to help her get out.  People, we need to spread the word.  Those workers needed sodas and water and hats.  Baby Jessica.  Oh, wait a minute.  What's that?  Dice.  Baby Jessica is now 32 years old.  Well, then she better get out of there because it's probably getting very tight for her.  You're a little late on that one.  Oh, wait.  Just like going down to ground zero. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, my God.  Tragedy.  Yeah.  I got to head over to the Dakota.  Dakota, because I hear one of the Beatles got shot.  Oh, it's a tragic day for everybody.  I got to get over there.  But now I'm going from over here to over here now.  I'm over here in Bethlehem.  You'll be the only one outside the Dakota.  That happened a long time ago.  Yeah.  I mean, there'll be tourists out there because they're there every effing day taking pictures of the place.  But I got to go to Bethlehem.  You're going to Bethlehem.  Oh, my God.  Look at this poor guy up on the cross. 
[02:51:00]  And they're nailing him up there.  Someone help the man.  Give him some water or something.  And then look at all.  No, they're putting thorns on his head.  Just give him a hat.  You don't put thorns on the head.  You give him a police hat.  An NYPD hat.  NYPD.  Yeah.  Oh.  And ladies and gentlemen, that was another episode of Quantum Dice.  Hey, it's Quantum Dice.  Hey, Quantum Dice. 
[02:51:30]  I'm Dr. Dice Beckett.  I go back in history.  I leap.  They call it leaping.  And I got to fix mistakes in history.  So everything's okay now.  See, that's what I do.  I got a happy face for a hologram that helps me out.  And sometimes I communicate with Club Soda Ziggy.  You know, a happy face hits the little light thing and says, I got to help out here. 
[02:52:00]  Some days I wake up.  I look in the mirror after I leave.  I'm a Negro.  And I'm like a ball player.  But sometimes I'm a chick with meat curtains.  And I go, oh, I got meat curtains.  And so once, I remember once I left.  And I'm a goddamn retard.  I was a retard, but I was still diced.  But I look in the mirror.  And I got a retard face.  I go, I go, hey.  Hey.  Hey.  I club Soda Ziggy.  And I got a retard face. 
[02:52:30]  But then, you know, the next day, I might be a midget.  And I hate the goddamn midgets.  Oh.  So I leave this one time.  And I'm in the body of a chick, right?  And then the hell, happy face, the hologram, starts banging me.  Bop.  Bop.  His yambig slapping against my ass.  Oh.  Quantum dice.  Quantum dice.  Next week, dice is in the Nixon administration while Nixon's recording. 
[02:53:00]  Hey, I hate the Jews, too, there, Tricky Dick.  I understand.  They're what you call shifty.  I understand.  We got to bomb the gooks in the Numb.  And for sweeps, for sweeps, dice in Saigon.  Hey, I can't believe I'm still in Saigon.  How does this happen?  I got to take a boat up the Numb River?  I got to kill some guy. 
[02:53:30]  Look, they napalmed the road.  This poor girl's running down it naked.  Someone help the poor girl.  I hear she's in Texas with a 97-year-old.  Ow!  Give her a hat!  All right.  Thank you, dice.  Oh, man.  I'm watching Quantum Dice.  Very nice.  That would be a great show.  Quantum Dice.  Quantum Dice.  Anthony on fire today.  I got to.  Man.  Hey, Mike, what's going on, bro?  Not to break from what I put on the screen, but I heard dice was helping with the recovery  effort of the dinosaurs.  A huge tragedy to come in. 
[02:54:00]  All right, Mike.  So how long has this been going on, man?  I mean, these guys have been about four years.  We've been watching them slowly, but surely you lose it.  I'm a comic, so I don't want to rip on a guy, but it seems like he's lost his mind.  It seems.  Well, no, but if comedy goes, most comics get on stage and they say, I remember this, and  then I was on my way to the show.  I mean, what just happened was real.  And, like, I don't know about anybody else, but I had this grin on my face like I just got  stoned for the first time.  I could not stop.  Because Anthony was doing exactly what we all wanted to be doing, just shut up.  I know.  He was fired up.  You should see he was bright red. 
[02:54:30]  His head was bright red.  I know.  I was spitting into the mic.  He's screaming into the mic.  And I thought, man, and then all of a sudden, boom, the brilliant comedy comes out of you.  So you've got to get him fired up until, like, he has a vein sticking out in his head.  And then all of a sudden, do fun.  So you go.  That's the key to get him fired up.  Man.  All right, bro.  All right.  Thank you.  There you go.  Plenty of fun.  Quantum dice.  That's fun.  That's fun.  Come on.  We're having fun today now.  It was really fun.  Well, now we can do an Alamo joke.  I know.  We're...  Yeah, yeah.  We know that dice history. 
[02:55:00]  Right.  Every time he calls now, you just do quantum dice.  Now we've got to do quantum dice.  We could always...  You've got a bit forever.  We could always go back to the Alamo.  There's plenty of history we can work on.  Dude, you went through a textbook already.  You were like...  You went through the history of the world.  I know.  You did, like, the last 200 years with dice.  Hand me a pen.  I'll sign the Magna Carta.  Doesn't anyone have a pen?  They've got to sign this thing.  That's funny.  You've got to take off?  I've got to go, man.  I've got to go get sound check.  Oh, he's giving us the signs. 
[02:55:30]  Anthony's giving us the signs.  Sound check.  Well, I'm sorry.  You guys spent so much time talking on my act and how funny I was.  We've beaten it today.  Look, I will tell you.  Answer it last time.  I saw Christopher last time.  It was very funny.  And it's not just you run in the middle, you know, going there and see a comic.  It's very funny stuff.  Intense stuff.  And it's an amazing chain of events you go through that are brought to you where you are now.  And it's really funny.  We got a standing ovation that you were there.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Very good.  They were leaving.  Whatever it was.  Yeah, but they were standing.  I saw they were standing. 
[02:56:00]  They didn't just stand up and go.  They stood up and clamped for a minute.  And then they laughed.  And then they laughed.  That's how good it was.  Guys, appreciate it.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, guys.  I will see you later.  Good luck with the Fox thing, too.  All right, man.  I feel much better when I'm hearing Dice.  I feel a lot better about my career.  I know you should.  Thanks, guys.  Talk to you.  All right.  Take it easy, Christopher.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Hello, America.  Opie and Anthony want you to vote for boobs.  Wait.
