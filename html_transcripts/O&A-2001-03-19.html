<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of Buck Cherry's music and a comparison to Steven Tyler's appearance, followed by a brief mention of the anniversary of Randy Rhoads' death.  A running gag involved a rotting fish hidden in the studio, its increasingly pungent smell noted by the staff.  Several callers phoned in; one corrected the hosts' inaccurate information about Randy Rhoads' musical contributions, while another discussed the death of John Phillips.  A substantial portion focused on listener reactions to a rape scene in the previous night's *Sopranos* episode, with speculation on plot developments and character fates. The hosts also commented on the physical appearance of contestants in a previous "Best Ass" contest.

The show then shifted to a discussion of the hosts' experience with "Planet Java Tremble," a high-caffeine energy drink, which fueled their hyperactive behavior.  They promoted their upcoming road show and a "milk challenge," offering a prize for drinking a gallon of milk in an hour without vomiting.  They also discussed a recent *Jackass* episode and their frustration with a perceived lack of respect from other radio shows, specifically regarding securing Vince McMahon as a guest.  Anthony's bowling skills (and the need for gutter guards) were also a topic, leading into a heated phone conversation with an unhelpful WWF publicist.

This conversation escalated into a profane and angry exchange, with Opie and Anthony expressing their frustration at the WWF's apparent disregard for their past support, despite their extensive coverage and promotion of the organization.  They threatened to boycott featuring WWF wrestlers until Vince McMahon appeared as a guest.  Numerous listener calls followed, some supportive, others critical.  Andrew Dice Clay called in, engaging in a rambling conversation punctuated by repeated, nonsensical questions about steak preference ("medium or well done?").  George from the puppet act "Otto and George" also called, resulting in a chaotic exchange with the puppet.

The broadcast continued with a bizarre skit involving George (the puppet) and the absent Otto, followed by a call from "Stalker Patty," a self-proclaimed regular at Paisano's restaurant, who the hosts teased about her alleged obsession with Opie.  Dice Clay called again, leading to a discussion of his career and perceived decline in intelligence, which segued into a promotional discussion of Paisano's.  Jay Moore, a scheduled guest, finally arrived in the studio.  Morgan from "my betsywill.com" then joined, promoting a hairy-man waxing segment.  They also discussed their upcoming appearance on Sally Jesse Raphael.  Numerous calls followed, including repeated calls from Lady Di, who was subjected to considerable ribbing and insults from the hosts.

Later, a phone call with Vince McMahon himself addressed Opie and Anthony's complaints about a poorly executed XFL pregame show and discussed the show's future on NBC, including potential announcer and scoring changes.  Their frustration with sports columnist Phil Mushnick was also mentioned.  In-studio guest Jay Moore discussed the XFL's success and challenges, including a visual achievement of overlaying the XFL logo onto NBC's peacock logo. The conversation then took a decidedly vulgar turn, focusing on Moore's unexpectedly low sperm count and the humorous details of his sperm sample donation process.  McMahon's call included casual conversation, jokes about firing people, and even a flirtatious comment about his daughter. The broadcast concluded with more off-color humor and promotional information.  Throughout the entire broadcast, there were numerous instances of crude humor, sexually suggestive remarks, and offensive language directed toward callers and individuals.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the ONA Show, and I have Buck Cherry riding.  Paul E. from Lawrence, getting right into it.  I liked the Buck Cherry song better the first time when it was called Lit.  I'm digging the new Buck Cherry.  Well, that's what Paul E. is saying.  We were watching the video in the back office.  The guy looks like Steven Tyler with blonde hair.  Younger, a younger version of Steven Tyler.  Well, yeah, Steven is getting a little up there. 
[00:00:30]  Steven Tyler now looks like an old lady.  Oh, you see the picture in the paper?  Yeah, we love Steven Tyler, but someone's got to tell him the scarf thing isn't happening anymore.  Yeah, don't do the scarf thing.  And, of course, Randy Rhoads died, I think, 19 years ago today.  So he threw a little odd G. at your park at the moon.  Retro rock, Opie. That's retro rock.  A little retro-ing. Retro rock.  And just like everyone else that plays the retro rock or anything else, 
[00:01:00]  it's always Ozzy or Guns N' Roses or Van Halen or Pink Floyd.  Anything else not allowed.  Whenever you hear retro rock, that's what you hear.  You know, for a goof, we should have done that, man.  Someone's saying, play some Cinderella.  We should have done it.  Oh, yeah.  Muxary sounds a lot like Cinderella from the 80s.  212-757-1027. 
[00:01:30]  This is the O&A Show.  Hello.  Hope everyone had a good weekend.  Yes.  Savage, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hammer Savage from Maffie Bob.  I was wondering, anybody found the fish yet?  The fish?  Yeah, the fish.  What is the, uh...  The staff's on the fish?  What's going on with the fish, man?  What's going on with the fish?  Ixnay on the fish-ay.  Okay.  It's still in position? 
[00:02:00]  Yes, it is.  My God, come on.  It's not refrigerated.  It's been a few days.  That's really got to be getting bad.  We picked the perfect place.  Let's just put it that way, because, uh...  Yeah, there's some waffling going on.  A little waft of, uh...  The smell is a waffling.  Odiferous wafting.  And, uh, people are starting to take notice,  but they don't know exactly where it's coming from.  Ha!  Oops.  Oh, Rob, stop being technical, I know.  Rob.  Yeah, what's up, O&A?  I know Randy Rhoads wasn't on Bark of the Moon. 
[00:02:30]  Who cares, though?  I don't care.  I just wanted to clarify.  It was excellent.  Nice little tribute.  I'm sitting outside my son's school waiting for him.  I had nothing better to do than call you guys and point that out.  It wasn't a tribute.  It was, hey, Randy Rhoads died 19 years ago.  Yeah, I know.  Here's some Ozzy.  Whatever.  I mean...  I know.  God.  It was B-A-B flashback.  It's all right.  It's not the cue.  We'll let it fly.  Don't have to get all the technical things right in there.  I guess if I was really going to get into it,  I would have told Ben to play something that Randy Rhoads played. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  I hear you.  Hey, just break this out.  You guys are turning to divies.  You can't take a little ball busting, huh?  No, I think we took it quite well.  We're busting you back.  I hear you.  All right?  I don't ever want to be a diva.  Well, you can't be a diva.  You're a guy.  Well, we don't call you divas.  You're a guy.  You're a diva.  And Phillips died.  John Phillips.  Yes.  His mamas and the papas.  Whatever.  Dead.  California Dreaming.  Dead.  He had a pretty rough life physically, so... 
[00:03:30]  We should have played Dreaming.  California Dreaming had started.  Oh, yeah.  We should have done that just so you could have got the abuse.  What are you playing, faggy?  Play something that rocks, faggy.  Andy's got a question that everyone wants to know.  Yes, Andy?  Good morning.  Good afternoon.  What do you mean good morning?  Good afternoon, guys.  Well, you know what?  That's, uh...  Yeah, that could...  You know what?  Actually, I just get up...  Can I say something?  Ha, ho, ho, ha, ha.  Before I get to Andy?  Yeah.  Holy ass. 
[00:04:00]  Where's Stinky?  Where's the Stinky?  I'm twumbling.  I see you.  Look at you.  You've been pacing about an hour ago.  What do you think of our new drink?  Oh, God.  It's good.  Dude, is it, like, really bright in here?  Right?  My pupils are huge.  I'm loving it.  I love the caffeine drinks, and I found a new one.  Yeah, it's a big rush.  It's called, uh, what, Planet Java Tremble?  Yep.  It's, like, three times to...  Four times more caffeine than Jolt.  Than Jolt.  Than Jolt.  You ever drink a Jolt? 
[00:04:30]  It's got four times more caffeine, and, Opie, you drank this about an hour ago?  No.  Uh, so we, what, 20 minutes ago?  Because I said, I ain't doing...  Oh, I'm not doing this alone, so Stinky and I went for it, and...  Man!  Because you couldn't even sit down.  You couldn't even sit down in your chair.  You're going around, he's swinging golf clubs in the office.  He's running around, he leaves this office, he comes back.  You're just a...  You're a mess now.  Now, you're all, like, you're trembling.  I've been running.  Put your hand out.  It rocks, though, right?  Stinky. 
[00:05:00]  It rocks.  It's a cool buzz, right?  It makes you rock.  It's not a buzz, but I'm just like...  I'm up!  I'm up!  That's an energy.  Up is a puff.  Is there any color in my eyes, though?  I think it's all pupil.  Yeah, you are definitely, uh...  You're speeding.  I believe they're going to be a new sponsor of our show.  They sent a few cases to the back office, so we're trying out all the flavors.  Yeah.  And they have this one that's Tremble, where it's four times the caffeine of Joltz.  Yeah, that's insane.  So Stinky and I are looking like, man, when did we pop that one?  Because we tried all the flavors, and then we're like, you know, we should just pop that 
[00:05:30]  just before showtime.  So Stink's doing it, too.  So...  Yeah, look at him.  Yeah, look at him.  Really good.  No, we're not good.  Hey, what?  Hey, what?  It's so much better to type this way.  It's just a good buzz, right?  Yeah.  It's not a buzz, but, uh...  Oh, you got a buzz?  You got a speed buzz.  A bit of energy.  Andy, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Yeah, um...  Regarding Friday's episode ending, fiasco, disaster, whatever you want to call it.  Hey, we pulled the show out of our you-know-what.  Yeah, I have to give you a prop, but you know what? 
[00:06:00]  Tell me, realistically, honestly, now, what did those broads look like?  What, the, uh, the ones that were in for the contest?  Yeah, because the way you guys described it was like...  We had a lot of girls here, though.  Are you talking about the girls that were in the ass contest?  No, no, no, no, no.  Because they were fine.  Not those girls.  Best ass contest continues this week, ladies, so come on down and show us what you got.  No, no, no, no, no.  Not those girls.  The other girls.  Yeah, those girls.  So give them more descriptive. 
[00:06:30]  Look, Andy, I was quite happy with the talent that showed up for, uh,  Musical Dildo Chairs.  How?  Yes.  It sounded, I could know it through the radio.  It was brutal.  Andy, what do they say about the fat chicks?  Oh, no, please.  Not the more you have, the more you like.  No, no, what do they say?  They could...  What do they do?  What do they do?  They could eat more.  Fat chicks give the best.  And they try harder.  Because they try...  Well, they have to, because...  Right.  Yeah, they have to make up for what they lack.  These girls on Friday were great. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, you do.  Absolutely great.  How about that military guy?  The guy with the soldier guy?  Oh, G.I. Joe.  Yeah.  We met some new freaks, man.  They were all great.  His girlfriend was in.  The drunk?  He was there with her.  The drunken...  How about the drunken one?  She never shut her mouth?  She was hammered.  Oh, my God.  I wanted to literally come down to the studio.  Andy, Andy, the noise is coming from your radio when she was, uh,  let's just say, receiving a bat.  Oh, that was painful for me.  I was driving home. 
[00:07:30]  There's nothing better than that.  You're not going to get a petite, cute, hot-looking girl to do that.  Only a filthy, skanky, uh, Farmingdale whore.  Hey, the world needs those, too.  Although Nikki, uh, did a good job.  She actually won the contest.  Yeah, Nikki won the trip to WrestleMania.  Yeah, well, she deserved it.  I mean, even Fat Squad deserved something.  No, she wasn't fat.  She wasn't fat at all.  She was gorgeous.  She was the hot one that, uh, played.  Yeah, well, listen.  And everyone has a right to win something,  even whether you're a beautiful, ugly.  Andy.  Even a sports guy. 
[00:08:00]  Andy.  So you jerk off.  Andy, thank you.  All right.  All right.  I don't know what Andy was getting at.  I don't either.  But, uh, it ended up being a good little, uh, segment on the show.  Tony, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Dude, the end of that show took me back to the, uh, Ali Liston fight.  Why?  The fix was in.  Oh, you thought the fix was in?  I was pulling for myself.  Oh, dude.  Oh, my God.  Is she hot.  You saw, obviously, you saw that ass, but mod on. 
[00:08:30]  What, Nikki?  Mod on.  Oh, yeah.  Nikki was very hot.  And there was no fix.  A lot of people thought there was no fix.  Nah, I'm not.  I'm only goofing, but.  But Nikki was, you know, she could move around faster.  She was quicker.  Yeah.  That's what happened.  She was agile.  No kidding.  The cheetah could always outrun a, uh, buffalo there.  No, she was doing.  Oh, and she was sliding right under the fat asses.  Yeah, they couldn't sit down fast enough, and, uh.  Dude, I saw it.  It was funny as hell.  Ah, cool.  Boys, uh, Ed, this time I'll give it to you.  You know what I'm talking about with that ass.  What? 
[00:09:00]  I know what you're talking about.  Oh, dude, she was hot.  Oh, yeah.  86, the buffaloes, dude.  All right, Tony, thank you.  Later.  You know what I'm talking about.  Let's go to Kenny.  Kenny, what's up?  What's going on there today?  Hey.  Hey, listen, you're retro rock.  You forgot the ACDC.  Yeah, okay.  You are absolutely right.  ACDC, also a retro rock.  You'll never see them really go off into any real new groundbreaking directions when any, uh,  any of the stations that do the retro rock thing. 
[00:09:30]  There are a few.  Yeah, Van Halen's big, too.  The ACDC and Van Halen are big.  Retro rock in general just is lame because it's the same exact songs by those bands that  you've heard a million times.  Yeah, the same songs.  It's not even like they, uh, going to...  They're just dressing it up differently.  Now they call it retro rock.  Retro rock.  Oh, we're going to hear The Wall again.  Here we go.  Who cares?  Great.  Constantly known.  Wow, I haven't heard that on the radio.  Here it comes.  But now they're calling it a retro track or retro rock, so it must be cool now.  Yeah.  It's the same old song.  Hey, guys.  Fine.  Yeah, a little Zeppelin, too, for the retro. 
[00:10:00]  Yes, Kenny.  I was up in Boston, man.  I'm missing you up there.  Well, we're going to get our asses back there soon enough.  Spent the weekend up there.  Wonderful place.  Cool.  He's there.  He's everywhere.  Two and a half months.  We'll be back.  Beautiful.  Thanks, Kenny.  Have a good one.  All right.  And counting.  Mm-hmm.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  Hey.  You guys, uh, if you pay attention to the gang of the Sopranos when they're doing the  song...  Yeah.  ...the intro, keep tuning the radio to you guys.  I don't think it is, though.  It says 102.7 right on the radio.  A lot of people think it is, and I've slowed that thing down and really take a look. 
[00:10:30]  It's not 102.7.  It is 102.7.  I really don't think it is.  If you slow it down on video and freeze-frame it, you can see it's 102-something.  Someone helped me out with this, but I think in the first season of Sopranos, it was very  obvious, and now it's like a quicker shot of the radio file.  No, it's the same.  It's the same.  I just figured it was so young, giving you guys a plug somehow.  Believe me.  I was looking.  All right.  Well, what do you think it is?  I think it's like 102.9 or some, like, thing.  It's not...  It's got to be seven. 
[00:11:00]  It's not a seven.  I slowed down the video.  I freeze-framed it.  They have the local references.  On last night's show, they...  Oh, they said, yeah.  What, are you going to announce it on the fan?  The fan.  On WFN.  And they also mentioned...  10-10 wins.  10-10 wins, even though they mentioned, you know, check it out on 10-10 wins or whatever,  and then they looked at the TV.  It's on the TV.  Yeah.  It was a good episode last night, man.  Jesus Christ.  That show is heating up.  No one died, though.  Oh, it doesn't matter.  Come on.  The shrink got raked.  Oh, my God.  Was that brutal?  It was brutal. 
[00:11:30]  And then I'm just waiting for Tony to find out.  Come on.  He's going to cut the guy's walls off.  But she's not going to tell Tony.  We were talking about this in the back office.  Yeah, yeah.  Hope's got the thing that's going to happen.  It's going to be the therapist's boyfriend that's going to tell Tony.  Yep.  And he's the one that's so dead set against this and everything, but since he's the boyfriend  and nothing's going to happen because the guy got off the hook, well, for a technicality  for raping her, he's going to go to Tony, I bet.  You're right.  Erica.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey. 
[00:12:00]  So funny that this guy brings it up because I was actually watching the first season last  night on DVD.  Yeah.  And my boyfriend and I, we did the freeze frame, and it actually says 10-22.  Oh, it's the time.  Right.  It's a clock.  Yeah.  Ah.  But it looks like 1027, but did you guys know that, like, one of the first episodes  when Jackie dies, he reads the thermometer, and Tony says that his temperature is 1027.  Nice.  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  There's a reference.  Now we're stretching.  And I'm not giving away anything. 
[00:12:30]  I'm not giving away anything.  We're just talking about the episode that aired last night, you bunch of frigging tools.  We don't know how The Sopranos end.  We don't know how it goes.  We're watching like you guys.  You've got to be Kreskin to figure out that if Tony Soprano finds out his shrink was raped  by some guy, that that guy's not saying he's going to be in a jar somewhere.  That guy is so dead.  Dead.  Not even funny.  Dead.  We're just like you guys watching The Sopranos.  And Meadow's mooly boyfriend?  Dead.  Dead.  You think?  Hell yeah. 
[00:13:00]  At least he's going to have a very good beating thrown to him.  You see that last night when Tony's talking to that guy, the young guy?  He goes, hey, Tony, don't worry about the mooly.  I won't say anything.  It's like you can't get out in the neighborhood.  Jamie, what's going on?  You know your asses were sitting on the edge of the chair waiting for Lorraine Bracco to  start telling Tony that this guy gave it to her in the stairwell.  Hell yeah.  How hot was that when he ripped her panties off? 
[00:13:30]  Look, you know, you don't want to say that it was hot or anything.  Oh, come on!  But there was something kind of sickly titillating about that scene.  Sickly titillating?  And there is not a guy that was watching that last night that didn't wish he wasn't  ripping the underwear off and jamming the back of her ass into those stairs.  Come on!  Hey, Jamie's at least being honest.  When he left and then the camera pans back and she's laying on the stairs and her panties  on the side and her skirt's kind of hyped up. 
[00:14:00]  There you go.  That was terrible.  Come on!  The only thing that was terrible was when she was laying on the sofa afterwards at home.  God, that was twisted.  That was bad!  But you know that Tony's going to take the moly and stick him up the other guy's ass for  right there.  All right, bro.  Later!  Thanks, Jamie.  Norton wasn't on the subscribe button.  I was just reading that.  Fat Rob, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How come you didn't tell us Norton was going to be on The Sopranos last night? 
[00:14:30]  That was him in the stairwell, right?  Jesus.  No, it was an actor based on Norton.  Oh, I want his opinion on this one.  Imagine that actor walking around Manhattan, everyone looking at him like, you're the racist.  Oh, you're the guy.  I got to go get a cop.  There he is right there.  But he's also Employee of the Month.  Yeah.  Got something going for him.  But he had a nice smiley face.  Yeah.  Employee of the Month.  Weren't you, though, that guy was saying you were waiting at the end of that episode.  It's like, come on, would you tell him?  It was painfully obvious that she wasn't going to say anything because they were just dragging 
[00:15:00]  it out for the last 20 minutes of the episode.  Yeah, and that's why you're thinking that the boyfriend is going to say something because  it's not her personality to tell Tony that that happened to her professionally or even  the way she is.  It's just not in her to say that.  But the boyfriend, yeah, I think.  Boyfriend tells Tony.  Tony gets rid of the dude.  And then it starts some new storylines.  Yeah, because now this guy's involved.  And that guy's involved. 
[00:15:30]  And you know he's like a squirrely dude that can't keep his mouth shut.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, boys, what's going on?  Hey.  Was that the most insane way to end that show last night?  You're like, you thought she was going to say it.  I know.  She's like, no.  I think everybody just went, oh, come on.  And he told you, he was like, yeah, oh, come on.  He was like, oh, come on.  And he was watching it.  We're like, Jesus Christ, just tell him.  We want to see a lot of that easy dress up.  It was an insane show.  Oh, God, I can't wait to see the next one.  Yeah, you so want to see him just take care of that guy. 
[00:16:00]  But here's the problem.  He spelled that like Al Capone.  Here's the problem, though.  They won't even touch on that storyline next week.  No.  I know.  Don't let it go.  We got Pauly coming aboard.  I know.  Pauly from Rocky.  Hey, Pauly.  Enjoy the moment, Pauly.  Who gets it over the head?  I saw in the preview.  Someone gets it over the head with a golf club.  Did you recognize him?  No, no, no.  I didn't either.  I hate those previews.  And now, next week on The Sopranos, you're like, oh, I've got to get some info.  I've got to know what's going on, some information on The Soprano. 
[00:16:30]  By the time they focus in on it, it's too late.  I know.  And it's so quick.  It's like these quick clips.  I need more.  I need more Soprano.  Joe, what's up?  What's up?  Hey.  Anybody notice how weird the Shrink's boyfriend was last night, how he was acting?  Yeah.  I think he had something to do with her getting raped.  No.  Come on.  He called up the detective on the phone and also started swearing.  And then he hangs up the phone.  She says, I want to talk to him. 
[00:17:00]  And he said, well, they told me everything.  Joe, I think I'm picking up on what you picked up on, but I think it's just that that guy was  a bad actor.  Yeah.  You think that's what it was?  Yeah.  And he's like a wormy guy.  And he's got no balls.  I didn't think that guy was a good actor at all.  I don't know.  I think there's something fishy going on in Jersey.  All right.  We'll see.  All right.  Thanks.  And the little dream she had where she was dreaming her hand got stuck in the soda machine  and the rapist shows up and the big friggin' pit bull rips his balls off. 
[00:17:30]  Acme Coke.  Yeah.  And you're just looking at the dog going, I had this, Tony.  Okay.  Yeah.  I got to see it, though.  It's going to happen.  Susan has a take on the whole rape scene.  Susan.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  Listen, I think the reason why they let that guy go was because he was Italian and his  family is in the family.  And so they got to the police and told him to lose the evidence.  And then Tony's going to find out about it and he's going to be torn because it's going  to be a family member and a therapist. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, interesting.  Oh, I like how you think.  That's good.  Yeah, because there's so much more to it, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  They can make this last a while.  Oh, I like that, Susan.  I like how you think.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  I like how they're doing this, though, with the show.  It's like it's spread out over a longer time instead of each episode just being a one-hit  thing and then they go on to something else.  It's getting a little more like a drama, soap opera type thing.  A lot of little soap opera storylines intertwined.  Bob, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing, man?  Good.  Hey, you guys check out last night on the scene from next week. 
[00:18:30]  If you see at the end, when Meadow's leaving to go back to school, she's holding the lamp  that the feds put the microphone in.  So it looks like that thing's going to be going to the city with Meadow.  Oh, really?  They're not going to be having their little microphone anymore on him, but that broad better  keep her mouth shut.  You know what, though?  But that sets up the whole storyline with her black boyfriend.  Oh, if all of a sudden they get some audio and her having sex with the boyfriend and  give it to Tony.  There you go.  Go on, that show rules. 
[00:19:00]  I didn't even pick up on that.  Yeah, you guys got to check that out at the end.  The previews is what you really got to look at.  You got to tape it and then slow-mo the whole thing so you know who's getting what.  That's great.  Someone knows who gets the golf club.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening, fellas?  Hey.  Yo, the dude who gets the golf club across the head is the Moody boyfriend.  I didn't see that.  Yeah, man.  I know it's a quick clip, but that's who it was, man.  I'm telling you.  Hmm.  All right.  I'll have to look.  All right.  I'll have to look. 
[00:19:30]  Thanks, Paul.  You got it, bro.  I didn't see that.  Anyone else see that?  No.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  How happy were you yesterday when Tony's sister got the crap beat out of her?  She is the most disgusting woman on television.  She is so annoying.  It's not even funny.  She's just this fat, disgusting, conniving weasel.  And at the end, she turns to God.  No, she doesn't.  Yeah, she does.  She's so full of crap.  Well, yeah.  In the show, she did. 
[00:20:00]  That's what I'm talking about.  But that's a bunch of crap.  Everything she does is like a crock of crap.  And to get tied up with the Russian mob?  Oh, that's great.  Because now Tony's got to do something.  He doesn't know who doesn't care.  They're going to bring in the Russians in because she messed with them, you know?  Yeah.  That was great when she got beat up, though.  All right, guys.  She's another one of those actresses.  You see her on the street and you're like, oh, God, you're such a pig.  I hate you.  Get away.  Yeah.  You know?  There's no way the rapist is mob connected. 
[00:20:30]  A connected guy is not going to be employee of the month at a local burger place.  Well, there you go.  That's pretty good, too.  All right.  Well, that was just someone's take on it.  We'll see.  We're just guessing here.  Randy.  Hey, yeah.  It was just with the previews.  They showed the lamp that's in the basement with a tap.  It was up in the kitchen like Meadow was taking it to the college.  Yeah, see, I didn't mind to watch the previews close at all.  So, yeah, that should make for an interesting little twist.  Cool, man.  Thanks, Randy.  All right, later.  Bye. 
[00:21:00]  Go to John.  John, you're next on WNEW.  Hey, remember in Goodfellas when Nelsie, she got screaming,  uh, screaming, Janet Rossi, Janet Rossi.  You remember that?  What?  Yeah, all right.  You remember the guy, the rapist, his last name was Rossi, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  And then Goodfellas, go, who was cheating with, uh, Ray Liotta.  Her name was Rossi.  Janet Rossi.  Okay, so?  And you're saying? 
[00:21:30]  I just think it's a coincidence.  And, yeah, it was also the charcoal brickhead who was getting slammed over the head with the golf club.  No, I don't think so.  Thank you, John.  All right.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Uh, when you take a look at the previews for next week,  Meadow's boyfriend or Meadow's, the kid she's with,  it's not the, it's not Noah, it's not the black kid.  It's some guy named Saul.  She yells it out right before he gets hit.  Yeah, that's what I heard.  I heard a name, but I couldn't quite make it out.  It's like either Saul or Sal, but I think it's Saul. 
[00:22:00]  Very injured.  Very injured.  I was hit on the head with a golf club, and it hurt me.  My shoes fell off.  It's going to be Jackie Jr. that goes after the kid.  It ain't going to be Tony.  I think it's Jackie Jr.  He's going to try, he's going to try and get in.  That's how he's going to try and get in by beating up that kid.  All right.  Well, so far, Sopranos are getting rave reviews in my book, man.  Oh, yeah.  They're doing a great job.  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  I think we're just about done with that. 
[00:22:30]  Yes.  It's like a lot of people saw the episode last night.  Yeah, that would be kind of funny if Noah did get hit with a golf club, the whole Tiger Woods thing.  Jesse.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I was on the, I went over there on Friday for the Best Ass contest.  I just want to know how you guys are going to judge it.  Which one were you?  Jesse, number 10.  Jesse.  Oh, I remember you.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, you got a nice bootay.  Thank you.  The listeners are going to start voting soon.  Okay.  We need to, you know, keep it going a few more days to get some more ladies down here. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, it's not going to end on Friday, then?  It's going to keep going?  Yeah.  Well, no.  What's going to happen is I think we're going to get the ladies all this week to get their asses down here, so to speak.  Okay.  And then I guess we'll get a bunch of us in the back office to pick some finalists, and then from there it's the listeners again.  Okay.  Voting for the one they think is the best.  All right.  All right.  Can I say hi to my boyfriend?  Yeah, what's his name?  It's Jason.  There you go.  Thank you.  Thanks, Jesse.  Bye.  All right.  And Anthony Winter, the best ass, will get their own professional photo shoot and could become the next Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed spokesperson, 
[00:23:30]  courtesy of Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed, sponsoring the best ass contest.  Do the weed and you'll succeed.  Nice.  All right.  Let's take our first break, Ant.  Yeah.  Anthony's a little sore today.  A little sore.  Yeah.  Trouble.  Trouble.  Ah.  Stretching.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll talk about that next.  Was it working out?  No.  No.  Are you still working out?  Sports related?  Oh, yeah.  Sports related? 
[00:24:00]  Not really.  I don't know if it's called a sport.  A sport.  Some people would like to think it's a sport.  Any sport you can drink at is a sport.  All right.  I love it.  And more of your phone calls, 212-757-1027.  This is a sideburns cupboard.  Mark Albert, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony on 102.7 WNEW.  Is this the right station?  Yes.  It is.  A little corny.  Yes.  Informative.  Frank Caliendo got great reviews over the weekend. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  A lot of people went out and saw him.  And they were not disappointed.  It's the OHSL.  Funny guy.  2-1-2-757-1027.  Just a few days away from our first road show in like eight months, Anthony.  Very psyched.  We are very, yeah.  Very excited about this one.  It's going to be a good one.  A lot of debauchery.  Finally, we're going to hit the stage with some scantily clad, if I can use the safe term, 
[00:25:00]  women, chicks, some of the freaks, which is always a fun thing.  And you never know what types of talents they have.  It could be at the Vanderbilt in Plainview on Long Island.  Doors open at 6.  Get there early.  It's going to be a madhouse.  An effing madhouse.  Yeah.  So let me just take this call real fast, then we'll get into Anthony's weekend.  Nick, what's going on?  What's up, guys? 
[00:25:30]  Hey.  Hey, what did you think of the new jackass last night?  I thought it was kind of lame.  There were a couple of good moments, though.  Yeah.  You didn't think that one guy taking a dump on the side of the road?  That was hysterical.  There you go.  That was hilarious.  Yeah, that was great.  Guy just pulls his pants down.  He's reading a newspaper, squatting, taking a dump on the side of a public road.  So people are driving by.  This guy's squatting, bare ass, taking a dump, reading the newspaper.  Just going through the paper like if he was sitting on a bowl.  That was great.  That was good. 
[00:26:00]  The milk challenge is great.  Yeah.  That guy was yakking.  Look at the guy from Monty Python.  I never saw so much stuff come out of someone's mouth.  The guy kept just buckling over and puking and puking.  When the chick finally puked.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  He just kept puking.  The milk challenge is impossible.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a drink a gallon of milk within an hour.  Many people have tried it.  No one has been able to do it without puking.  We'll have to do that.  Give someone a prize if they can do that.  You want to do that? 
[00:26:30]  If they want to come down here with a gallon of milk and drink it in an hour, we'll give  them a prize.  Why not?  Yeah, but they got the bucket.  It's impossible.  It is impossible.  If you get another trip to WrestleMania, anyone that can do it without puking in an hour?  If you think you can do it, let us know.  Thanks, Nick.  All right.  Later, guys.  All right.  Let's go to Don.  Don, what's up?  Hey, guys.  You saw a jackass last night?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just talking.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  You see that guy doing the stilt diving?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This guy's going to kill himself, man. 
[00:27:00]  He's 30 feet up.  He gets on stilts.  He's hard enough to balance.  He's going to jump into the water that way?  Yeah.  That was crazy.  That's Steve-O, who's my new favorite jackass guy.  Oh, he's the best.  I'm surprised that the stilt didn't go up, you know, where?  You know?  He's the one who had his eyebrows waxed off.  Yeah.  And he's wearing a wig now.  That was insane.  I also thought the paintball thing was really good.  Yeah?  When Johnny Knoxville was doing a shoot for Rolling Stone, and he stands up in front of  a thing with a bullseye painted on him, and his buddies shoot him with paintball guns. 
[00:27:30]  And they can't be more than, what, 30 feet away?  Oh, if that.  Yeah.  The welts these things raise on him were disgusting.  And then they're all laughing at him.  I don't know how those hurt, man.  Those really hurt.  Jason, what's going on?  Dude, what's, Opie, what's your favorite guy's name?  Steve-O.  Steve-O.  You'll like him, because they keep showing his junk.  He's a, he's a bit, uh, he's a, I don't know what he is.  Dude, that's pissing me off.  Why do they got to keep showing his junk?  He's, he's insane, though.  No, he's great.  And all that crap is good that he does.  He wears that thong, and then, like, uh, he had to, like, pull it up his crack last night, 
[00:28:00]  because it wasn't showing off enough.  That, yeah, that stuff, I could do it out, but the guy's insane.  Come on, it's turning gay.  I think they're all a bunch of freaking pencil pushers.  Jason, when he, when he had his eyebrows waxed.  That was sick.  That had to hurt.  They did his nipple, like, four times before it came off.  Yeah.  He was red raw.  Oh.  Steve-O's the guy that swallowed the goldfish.  And puked it back up.  Back up, the first episode of that.  He couldn't quite puke, though, so he's going, ah. 
[00:28:30]  And they gave it to the bum.  Yeah, and the goldfish lived.  All right, boys.  Thank you.  Later.  See, now we've got a ton of people that want to do the milk thing.  No, I could do it easily.  No, you can't.  It's impossible.  You'll puke.  You want to have the milk challenge?  You know, it's a page right out of Jackass, but I'm telling you, it cannot be done.  Ain't going to work.  Get in the buckets.  We've got to come up with a prize, but it cannot be done.  What do we got?  Anything laying around?  I'd have them come down.  I'd be into watching you try to do that. 
[00:29:00]  Dave.  Listen here, D, I could do it.  Me and my brother could do it, man.  You could do the milk challenge.  Hell yeah, I could do it.  Dude, for WrestleMania tickets or Odd Fest, whatever, anything you guys got, I want to  just, like, do it and, like, prove it wrong.  Me and my brother.  Me and my brother are going to do it.  Have you ever tried it?  No, but I could do it.  Have I ever tried it?  He hasn't done it, but he says he could do it.  Dude, I could do it, man.  I'm going on record.  It's impossible, okay?  Dude, I could do it.  There's not a guy out there that could do the milk challenge.  You have to drink a whole gallon of milk within an hour.  And not puke. 
[00:29:30]  Dude, I'm telling you, I could do it.  So even if you drink the whole gallon of milk and you still have 20 minutes left in the  hour, you still have to wait that 20 minutes.  You cannot hold it down.  You can't hold it down.  Yeah, if I can't do it, my brother can.  My brother Marcelo.  Marcelo, what's up?  All right.  Thanks, Dave.  Yo, let us do it, dude.  I think I know what we can do.  We'll all ante up money.  We'll get the station ante up money, whatever.  We'll have the milk challenge.  It'll start off, I don't know, we'll get 200 bucks.  Okay.  All right?  200 bucks for an hour's work. 
[00:30:00]  We'll get like five or six guys down a week.  Yeah.  All right?  They try the milk challenge.  A week.  I don't want to deal with this every week.  I know.  But as soon as none of those guys do it, they won't throw more money into the kitty.  Oh, do it that way.  Kind of do, you know, who wants to be a millionaire, how they're adding to the grand prize.  Do you think you could drink that milk without puking?  Gelman?  Impossible.  Of course it is.  We could have our first run at it this week.  I don't care.  How much you want to do? 
[00:30:30]  They said they'll give us money for stuff like this.  We'll start with 200 bucks.  200 bucks.  It's yours.  First guy to do it.  Yeah.  Okay.  At last.  All right.  I'm in.  I've got some cash.  Good for the show.  Dominic, what's going on?  Hey, how are you, man?  I'm in.  You're in.  And I'll go downstairs and whack back a couple of some breaths with everything on it after  the 60 minutes and I finish it up.  Impossible.  Ain't going to happen.  Have you tried this before? 
[00:31:00]  Yes, we have done this.  And you kept the milk down?  Well, yeah.  After an hour, I'll cut a light up for you in the bucket in front of everybody.  That's fine for me.  But hey, let me tell you.  I'm in and I'll do it.  All right.  Hold on the line.  All right.  Someone should get these guys.  What day do you want to do it?  I'll just tell them Wednesday.  We'll do what?  We want to do it tomorrow?  Dominic, can you get down here tomorrow?  Sure can.  All right.  Hold on the line, okay?  Okay.  All right.  It's impossible. 
[00:31:30]  Al, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, what's up with you guys the other day having that freaking imitator on over and over and over?  You're talking about the ass.  You're describing the ass and then you cut it off to talk to this freaking idiot.  What idiot?  I have no idea what you are talking about.  That was on Friday, Thursday, the ass contest.  Explain what you're talking about.  Yeah, explain yourself.  You're describing these chicks.  They're taking off their clothes.  Right.  And then the idiot starts talking.  What idiot?  What idiot? 
[00:32:00]  What are you talking about?  That guy who was doing the imitations, man.  You know who I'm talking about.  Oh, Frank?  Yeah.  Frank Caliendo?  Yeah, that idiot.  You're listening to the wrong show if you didn't enjoy that.  Bro.  That was great stuff.  All we want to hear is about the ass.  Don't talk about it.  Like we didn't talk about the ass.  Not enough.  That's true on Friday.  Not enough.  You know, you guys suck.  You've got to describe it all.  Our listeners suck.  Oh, but you don't lump them all into one suck category like that call.  No one's appreciative because if we spent the day talking just about asses, 
[00:32:30]  then you get a ton of email and calls complaining you're focusing too much on the asses.  Guys, can't you talk about anything else?  So then you bring in a guy like Frank Caliendo, who in my opinion is one of the best impressionists out there.  Very good.  Killed for us.  And this guy's saying, you know, that was boring and I want to hear more about the asses.  It's a fine line.  Never satisfied.  We must walk the fine line every day between ass and funny.  Ass and funny.  Rob, what's up? 
[00:33:00]  Oh, I appreciate you.  I'd love to let you know.  Listen, I have a question about Vince.  Yeah.  I was listening to a popular morning show on the radio and I heard that he was going to be on there.  And I was wondering, what's the deal?  Because you were promoting that last week.  Yes.  Well, we've been huge into the WWF.  We know what we're talking about when we talk about the WWF.  We're into Vince McMahon.  So, I don't know.  This is the reason a lot of times we don't say beforehand who's going to be on the show.  Because there are certain people in this city, certain shows in this city, that will, just to stick it up our ass, book guests that we already have booked for a slot before us. 
[00:33:30]  Right.  It happens.  You know, if Vince is not on our show this week, I'm going to be very, very disappointed.  Yes.  Extremely disappointed.  Did you guys happen to catch their take on the Costas-McMahon interview taking Costas' side in the whole matter?  No.  Oh, it was hilarious.  Costas looked like a complete tool during that interview. 
[00:34:00]  Absolutely.  And we'll say that right up until Vince doesn't show up here.  And then, nah.  Whatever.  We'll be really disappointed.  Doing this afternoon thing, quite frankly, is starting to suck.  That's all I have to say.  But read into it, if you will.  But it just sucks.  You don't get the respect.  You don't get any respect.  We'll see. 
[00:34:30]  Let's see what happens.  Let's see.  Let's stay along for the ride.  We'll see where we all end up, right?  It'll be an interesting week.  It certainly will.  Well, not a week.  We don't feel like being in anyone's shadow anymore.  Absolutely.  Thank you, Rob.  All right.  Queens courier all the way.  All right.  All right.  We'll see what happens, Anthony.  Yes.  But, I don't know.  I mean, the whole Vince McMahon thing, it sounded like he was definite.  Now, it's like a little more than 50-50. 
[00:35:00]  And if he doesn't come in this week, you know what?  We're going to be very disappointed.  Get the headquarters on the phone.  Get WWF headquarters on the phone.  Let's hash this out.  Yeah.  Can we talk to someone over there?  Get them right on the phone.  Why not?  Give us the number.  Because it's Vince's publicity guy.  We don't care.  Call up their big headquarters.  Yeah, call up and ask and tell them we want to talk to them.  See what they say.  We want to talk to somebody on the air.  And if they don't go on the air, just go, well, we're just kind of curious, you know, 
[00:35:30]  what are the odds of Vince being on the show?  Go ahead.  But really push that we want to talk to them on the air very quickly.  All right.  Very courteously.  Very nice question about the booking.  There we go.  Let's see how this pans out.  Although I'm already having a feeling I know how this is going to end.  We're not going to be in one market forever, so they've got to give us some respect.  Yes.  Give us the respect now.  I don't have respect.  All right.  We've got a ton of guys that want to do the milk thing tomorrow. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  And they're all like, I can do it.  John.  At least this guy says, I think I can do it.  I can do it.  Oh, you can.  Yeah.  Am I on?  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, how's it going?  All right.  Like a gallon of milk?  Yeah.  No problem.  Well, you've got to keep it down.  It's not like jackass where you can keep drinking and puking and drinking and puking.  Right.  This is all about drinking a gallon of milk.  Right.  And nothing coming out for that whole hour.  Right.  So if it takes you 10 minutes to drink the gallon of milk, you still have to sit there  for 15 minutes.  Sit there for 15 minutes and then what? 
[00:36:30]  Pick my nose?  It ain't happening, John.  It's not going to happen.  You want to do a side bet?  You're so cocky.  All right.  There you go.  See, everyone's...  I could do it.  Oh, have you tried it?  No, but I know I could do it.  We're not doing jackass rules where you're allowed to puke and continue drinking.  Right.  This is all about getting a gallon of milk in your second without puking in an hour.  Look, I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  Can we bring the cookies?  You can bring whatever you want.  Cookies?  You just got to drink the milk.  If they want...  You got to have something to down it with, you know? 
[00:37:00]  Trust me.  The cookies makes it worse.  Yeah.  Bring your cookie.  Or am I going to lose my cookies?  Bring your cookie.  You think I'm going to lose them, don't you?  Thank you, Chuck.  It ain't happening.  No.  We'll start with two, 250 bucks.  No one's going to win it tomorrow.  And then we'll wait a week or two, and then we'll up the ante.  Up the ante.  We'll throw a couple more hundred...  A couple hundred more into the pot.  And we'll just keep up in the ante until someone does it.  Until it's huge.  It's just not going to happen.  Hmm.  All right, Ant. 
[00:37:30]  Phew.  So you're a little...  Let's talk about my big weekend.  You're a little sore today?  A little sore, Opie.  Had a good, fun-filled weekend.  Did a lot of stuff.  One of the things was a little bowling.  I haven't been bowling in quite some time.  So I went bowling.  Some of that midnight bowling?  Some of the midnight, nighttime bowling.  It wasn't midnight.  You know, it was maybe 10 o'clock, something like that.  A little bowling.  They have really jazzed up bowling.  Well, yeah, they have to do something, you know, to get away with having to wear those 
[00:38:00]  wacky shoes.  When we were growing up, bowling was very boring.  They had some lanes right there in Huntington.  It's an hour supermarket.  Mom and Dad would drop you off.  You'd bowl maybe a game, and then you'd hit the, you know, the games, the game room.  Right.  Until Mom and Dad came to pick you up.  Well, also, you were too young to drink back then.  So now when you go bowling, what you do is you drink a lot of beer, and it makes it even  better.  But now, you know, of course, they got the, what was this called?  Cosmic Bowl. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, the Cosmic Bowl.  They're at a bowling alley in Brooklyn.  And I walk in, and of course, you know, you just figure just for a moment we'll go bowling.  Walk in, there's just a thousand people in there waiting, signing up and stuff.  So I greased the guy.  And the guy behind the counter had a greasome.  I go, I pulled out.  What was it, like a two-hour wait?  Like, I'm not waiting.  I'm not waiting, right.  How much did it cost that he moved up?  I pulled out the deuce. 
[00:39:00]  20?  Pulled out a 20.  Nice.  And I kind of hold it in my hand, and I kind of hold it up so he can see it, but no one  else would go, I need an alley.  And the guy kind of just, he knows, too.  He took it the right way.  He goes, that kind of looks around, takes it.  He goes, all right.  He pulled out this huge list.  He, like, pencils me in above everyone's name first.  I'm like, ah, Cole, okay.  You've got to grease the guy if you want some action, Opie.  So I get the, we get the lane. 
[00:39:30]  And all of a sudden, I hear a DJ-type voice.  Welcome to Cosmic Bowl, everybody.  Hi, my name is Bob Stevens.  He was once on ABC.  He has to tell everyone?  Music Radio ABC.  Oh, yeah.  He's handing cards out to everybody.  Oh, cards.  He's got business cards.  Hey, thank you.  How you doing?  Hi, hi.  He's, he's, I don't know, 60.  He's wearing a Spider-Man shirt.  Like, not, not a, a t-shirt with a picture of Spider-Man on it. 
[00:40:00]  Uh-huh.  A Spider-Man costume shirt.  Like, if you were Spider-Man.  And, uh, and Big Jesse, uh, parachute pants.  Octopus pants?  Octopus pants.  Whatever the hell you, you call them.  They were huge pants.  I call them stupid.  And stupid pants.  And he was shoving balloons in his pants.  He put balloons, like blown up balloons were in his pants.  Why?  I don't know.  I was frightened.  And the guy's 60-something?  Yeah.  This is what we have to look forward to when our video appears over?  That's all I was thinking.  And if it ever gets that, you know the fact. 
[00:40:30]  You know the fact.  If, if, if, if I, you ever walk into a bowling alley and find me, um, there in a Spider-Man  shirt, the big pants, announcing.  Bad toupee.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, the whole deal.  And announcing, hey, there's a red head pin on lane eight.  You get a strike, you get a free game here.  And he's down on the, on the, uh, the bowling alley, uh, talking to the people.  Hey, oh, so close, so close on that one.  And then back up to the board.  And he's, he's playing all kinds of music. 
[00:41:00]  YMCA.  And a bunch of, uh, you know, party tunes.  Speaking of which, the guy from YMCA died.  Yes, he did.  The guy with the mustache.  Bad meat in a can, I heard.  I heard it was, uh, lung cancer.  Is that what they're calling it?  They're hiding it?  Food poisoning.  Bad meat in a can.  So this guy, old DJ from ABC, and this is what he's doing now?  Yeah, he's, uh, mixing songs and making sure if you have the red head pin and get a strike,  you get your free game.  Oh.  And, uh, this guy worked for WABC when it was cool. 
[00:41:30]  Uh-huh.  When the music was all right when we were growing up.  And now, now he's at a bowling alley?  Now he's at a bowling alley doing that gig.  But, but as he's playing the songs, he goes, and remember, listen to all your favorite  oldies on CBS FM.  And I'm like, all right, either CBS sponsors this gig in some way, shape, or form.  Maybe he's got a little part-time gig over there.  Or maybe he's got a part-time gig, or maybe he's trying to get a part-time gig.  Hey, come on, I always mention CBS at the bowling alley.  You could at least throw me a weekend shift. 
[00:42:00]  But it was kind of like, oh, I'm just, oh, God.  Oh, if you ever walk in.  There's our future staring us in the face.  Go around, take some time.  Okay, you walk in.  I'm doing that, right?  Take some time, walk around the alley, find the heaviest bowling ball you can find, okay?  And then throw it over my head.  Don't let me see you.  Don't let me see it coming.  I just want to be taken out like that.  But I think you would take pleasure in the fact that you know you're going to be knocked out at that point.  I would like to know that my miserable life is going to end. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  So you want me, if you're doing the bowling alley and I walk in there, you want me to say, oh,  and then just cave your head in.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I need, yeah, without a doubt.  Cave your head in with the big bowling ball.  You would have pinned.  The future doesn't look bright for us.  It never looks bright for DJs.  I know.  You're washed up by the time you're in your mid-40s in most cases.  Bad, bad news.  Some of them, like, go on to do other things in the business. 
[00:43:00]  Like radio, I'll think.  You could go to the internet radio.  Yeah.  Nah.  Yeah, it was, um, it was, it was something watching them, though.  Watching them work.  Here it goes.  Oh, and he gets a strike and a free game.  Macho, macho man.  I want to be, but I think, yeah, there it is.  All right, here we are.  It's Cosmic Bowl, everybody.  My name's Bob Stevens.  Did they have the laser light show and stuff? 
[00:43:30]  Oh, they have, like, wacky lights and stuff going around.  Look at those cool lights here.  It's a bowling alley tonight.  Cosmic Bowl.  I'm here, Steve.  Good job.  Fantastic.  Fantastic.  Could someone lay a big ball over my head, please?  YMCA, whatever it is.  Oh, so close to that red pin.  But we're going to give you a chance to pick up the spare and see if you can't win that game.  Where's my old on-air partner to put a pin over my head, please? 
[00:44:00]  Kill me.  Kill me, somebody.  See me as.  How did I end up in a goddamn bowling alley?  Get away from me, kids.  Nice shoes.  But I'm hit because I have my big Jesse pants on.  And my Spider-Man shirt.  And there's Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show on late 11.  So that was Saturday. 
[00:44:30]  Had a, uh, bold, bold, bold eight games.  Cos, you know, you're drinking beer and you don't realize your arm really hurts.  You don't realize your thumb is bleeding.  So you just drink more beer and you're balling more frames.  Did you hit the inside of your knee?  Nah, I didn't do that one.  I did do, you know what I did do, though?  You go back.  Ooh.  And the ball comes out of your hand. 
[00:45:00]  Cos I had just had my hand wrapped around a nice cold butt.  And I didn't dry it off good enough.  And, of course, everybody was like, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Like, I shut up.  You know, we wanted to continue our bikini, bikini babe concept.  We did bikini softball.  Yeah.  We wanted to do bikini bowling.  Why don't we?  We couldn't find a place that could kind of fit our crew.  Oh, come on.  That would rock.  Just like, you know, take over the bowling alley and watch girls in tiny little bikinis bowl.  That would rock.  We got to do that.  We tried.  We called a few places. 
[00:45:30]  But, you know, this cosmic bowling thing is taking off.  It's off the hook, yo.  Cosmic bowling.  Hey, uh, Abby, what's up?  Yo, ONA, what's going on?  Hey, bud.  You ever see that guy?  He always goes up with, like, 11-year-old girls.  He's always hugging them and kissing them every time they get up.  Yeah, I can't touch ya.  He's a kid toucher, I'm telling you.  Oh, please.  All right, Abby.  I saw him, you know, going over to some of the youngsters and encouraging them to get their strike for the red pin.  That's just a nightmare existence.  And, dude, I swear, if anybody that went up to him to even say hello or, hey, I got a red pin, he's handing business cards out. 
[00:46:00]  He's handing them out.  Steve.  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey, buddy.  You know, I've heard of dying with your boots on, but apparently Anthony wants to die with his bowling shoes on.  Why?  Because.  Ever heard of dying with your boots on?  Oh, if I'm ever doing that?  Yeah.  I mean, if you're 60 years old and in the bowling alley, you're going to die with your bowling shoes on.  You're the bowling alley DJ.  You don't want to be the bowling alley DJ, man.  Yeah, I think that's about the bottom of the barrel. 
[00:46:30]  I tried to be the skating rink DJ when I was coming along.  Oh, no.  All skate.  All skate.  I wasn't good enough to be the skating rink DJ.  They're in, uh, what was the name of that place in Northport, eh?  Couples only.  Couples only.  A lady's choice.  Right.  A lady's choice.  Right on 25A.  Sent him a tape and everything.  I wanted to be the skating rink DJ.  You want you to send him a tape?  Oh, yeah.  I would love to hear that tape.  Someone's got it.  You want it to be the roller rink DJ?  Yeah, that place in Northport on 25A near Carmel. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I remember that place.  Was it called Laces or something stupid like that?  Laces.  Oh, how's that for a topper?  Ho, ho.  Oh, now you're getting abused by your, uh, your bowling skills.  John, what's up?  Yeah, I was just wondering if when Anthony was bowling, did they have the little gutter guards down the sides of the people of the little kids?  Yeah, gutter guards.  That's what I need.  I need the gutter guards.  Well, you figure after a few drinks, we all need them.  I did pretty good.  I hadn't bowled in 10 years.  10 years. 
[00:47:30]  I bowled like a 174, and then, uh, you know, and then you bowl your 106 and 130.  Yeah, I was in the mid-ones.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, I don't want to get scientific on you, but the reason you can't drink milk with a full gallon of milk in your stomach is because your stomach's acidic and milk is basic.  It's like eating a whole pack of antacids.  There you go.  Yeah.  It can't be done.  It doesn't work.  Hey, Shaq, do it.  You've got a big stomach.  Are we going to try tomorrow, Rick?  We got enough contestants?  Yeah, we got a lot of guys that want to come down tomorrow to do it.  All right, we'll do it. 
[00:48:00]  Very easy.  You drink a gallon of milk within an hour, and you've got to keep it all inside for an hour.  Total of an hour.  Hey, it's, uh, Opie here.  Uh, remember, it's, uh, Moonlight Skating now.  So get your best gal and get out there on the floor.  All skate.  All skate.  Ladies' choice.  Any guys that aren't skating now are the real losers in this whole place.  That was always the worst lady's choice. 
[00:48:30]  You know, you went with your pals.  All right, here's Jack Wagner, all I need.  All skate.  All skate.  Let's take a break, Anthony.  We got a surprise outside the studio waiting to come in.  What do we got?  It's been a long time.  What do we got?  It's been a long time.  Oh, I know who's here.  Sure.  A little surprise for y'all.  It's another Opie and Anthony Rose show.  It's Thursday night at the Vanderbilt in Plainview, Long Island. 
[00:49:00]  The store is open at 6.  O&A will be there after the show.  This is 1027 WNEW.  It's the O&A show.  The guy from the WWF hung up, Anthony.  Oh, did he?  Yeah, we were going to talk to him.  He doesn't want to go on the air.  He's scared.  That's fine.  We'll talk to him, though.  We just want to know if Vince McMahon's going to be on our show this week.  He doesn't have to talk to everybody on our airwaves.  We can just talk to him. 
[00:49:30]  We have a feel we're going to be blown off, and it's not going to make us happy.  My aim isn't working.  Ah.  Hello?  You are off the air.  Who am I speaking to?  Scott, hello?  Well, we just have a couple of questions.  You know, we will... 
[00:50:00]  Oh, you will not hear you on these airwaves.  Believe me.  It is illegal.  Highly illegal.  To put someone on the air that doesn't give permission.  Okay?  We've been wanting to get Vince on the air.  You know, with the whole...  His PR guy you've been speaking to.  Trying to work it out so he comes on our show.  But now we're hearing tell he might be on other people's shows.  He's in the area, other gay parts, maybe before we get them. 
[00:50:30]  You know that?  Because you're just hearing my voice.  You're not hearing your voice.  This is what we call...  This is what we call the one-sided conversation.  Opie, he's listening, and he hears me talking, and he was a little concerned.  Okay.  So now, you know how we've always supported the WWF.  And we were right on top of the XFL.  Well, even before, we were a very short time employed by them.  Scheduling, he's saying. 
[00:51:00]  It has to do with scheduling.  It has nothing to do with us.  But we would definitely like a first whack at him.  You know what I mean?  You're not sure which day he was going to do it.  If he was going to do it this week, still waiting to hear back.  That means Vince McMahon will not be on our show.  We're getting blown off again.  As you know, he is on the road.  Where is Vince now?  Why don't we talk to him today?  On the phone.  Albany.  Can we get him on the phone any way possible today? 
[00:51:30]  For two minutes.  Doubt it.  Doubt it.  Damn it.  Damn it.  We would like it for two minutes.  Talking to the PR guy ten times a day.  Did you hear last Thursday we dedicated like an hour to the Vince?  Yes.  Yes.  Now, did you hear the thing we did about Vince on Costas?  What's going on around WWF headquarters about that whole thing? 
[00:52:00]  How did they think?  You haven't heard anything?  I mean, what?  Do they think Vince came off looking pretty good?  Or haven't heard either way?  Did they lock you in a closet or something?  You don't seem to know much.  Who can we talk to now that knows more than you do?  There's no one above you that knows more than you do that we can get.  But it seems like this guy doesn't know anything.  Do you know we are trying to get information and I don't think, I think you're blowing us off. 
[00:52:30]  Just tell him to be honest with us.  Be honest with us.  Who can we speak to?  No, just tell him to be honest with us.  Will Vince be on our show or not?  Will Vince be on our show?  This guy already knows.  He knows.  Okay, will Vince be on our show this week?  Will Vince be on our show this week?  I don't know.  I don't have an answer.  Will Vince be doing anyone else's show this week?  I know the answer.  What is it?  Yes.  What's the answer?  Yes. 
[00:53:00]  Yes.  All right, so you know that he is doing a show, but you don't know that he's doing us.  We are totally feeling like we're blown off.  If we don't get confirmation that Vince is going to be on our show this week, F everything.  We are then again in bad standing with the WWF.  That we have supported, that we have supported, that's not a good one.  That's not a good attitude to take, but we feel we have given you guys a lot and you've given us a lot and it's been a great relationship.  And why screw it up now by not getting Vince on this show to talk to people that know what the hell they're talking about? 
[00:53:30]  Tell them things like the XFL and WWF.  Tell them there's going to be a day when we're going to be syndicated all over the country and, you know, we need to be shown some respect now, Anthony.  We feel like we're getting F.  No, it's not that it's nothing personal.  This is business too.  Why isn't Vince doing this show?  That's great.  Wouldn't you guys feel a little funny if we, you know, we're doing WCW stuff the whole time? 
[00:54:00]  We've made it a point to blow off any of those tools that they've sent over here.  We've never done anything for them out of respect for WWF and Vince McMahon and Shane Owen.  And now we feel like we're being given the crappy end of the stick here.  No, that's not the case at all.  I don't know.  I'm feeling a little different.  I'm feeling different. 
[00:54:30]  Talk to a sales guy you're spending money.  I understand you guys are spending money, but it has something to do with our show, too.  You know, we got, we want Vince.  That's why they're sending a lot of people, wrestlers and stuff, and they can only do so much.  We're not, we're not.  Yeah, but we, cancel all the wrestlers that we're supposed to be in this week.  Yeah?  Seriously, yeah.  All right, you want to do that, O?  Yeah, right now.  Okay, we're canceling every wrestler that's supposed to come on, even Bubba, who's supposed to come in on Friday, 
[00:55:00]  until we get Vince McMahon on our show.  Okay?  Ask him if, when we go to mornings, if.  I think we have to do that.  Ask him when we go to mornings if Vince will be on our show then.  Yeah, when we go to mornings, will things change?  Maybe Vince will come on our show then?  Look, I, no, I understand, Vince probably wants to get on the airwaves, because of the situation with the XFL,  and really hit as many people as is humanly possible. 
[00:55:30]  But, you know, there are certain things he can do to keep relationships, uh, good.  I'm feeling like a whore.  That's been used.  Yeah.  My ass is starting to drop.  I'm feeling like a, like a coke whore over here.  Like, I'm getting slammed and slammed until it dries out.  And now we don't, uh, we don't get some of the high quality, uh, we're not getting the high quality queef, quim, whatever you want to call it.  We're the guys in this town that know more about the WWF than anyone. 
[00:56:00]  And the XFL, for that matter.  Uh-huh.  All right, no promises.  He'll try his best.  Well, we've got to put a moratorium on, on things, because we feel like we're not getting the, uh, respect and the, um, you know, the, the one hand washes the other thing.  I mean, we put it out, we put a lot out.  We put more out there for the XFL and for the WWF than anyone that he's booked on right now.  Let's say that.  And we're getting, and we're getting crapped on.  The guy's going to be right down the road, and he can't drop in here? 
[00:56:30]  You know, that's, believe me, it's not, it's not a scheduling problem.  We know these things.  We're not totally retarded.  Ask him what the real reason is.  What's the real reason?  Because we, we already know what the real reason is.  Let's see if he has the balls to tell you.  Someone will be upset if Vince is on our show.  Shane worked on.  You know, if it was just, if it was just that, uh, you know, spots for WWF and XFL ran on the Opie and Anthony show, that's one thing. 
[00:57:00]  We have, we have done, taken it out of our personal time to really promote both of the, uh, the Vince products.  And, uh, and now we're, we, you know, something like this happens and we're going to get crapped on.  We know it.  That's how we're feeling.  Silence, Opie.  Just cancel the WWF for this week.  Um, are we not taking Bubba in the studio? 
[00:57:30]  If Vince doesn't come in?  No, if Vince doesn't come in, then we can't take Bubba.  I know Bubba wanted to come in on his own, but you know what you tell Bubba?  Tell him it's not personal.  This isn't personal.  Okay?  It has to do with, uh, business.  Just like why we're getting F.  Okay?  All right, bye.  There we go.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Making our decision easier and easier.  The more we go along.  Unbelievable. 
[00:58:00]  Hmm.  Hmm.  What should we do?  Hmm.  Hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I don't get it.  We give, we give, and what do we get back?  We get crapped on.  Yeah, they've given us some great stuff, and we've given them great stuff.  And now when it comes time where Vince is in the news, topical, things are hot, things  are heated up, the whole controversy with whether the XFL is going to sink or swim, and  oh, but we're not good enough to have Vince on for that. 
[00:58:30]  You know, if he wants to come on and promote a pay-per-view, how many times?  That's fine.  How many times have we taken their, uh, their, like, average to lame wrestlers to help them  out just because we feel like, okay, you know, we'll help them out.  They got a pay-per-view.  They send ivory.  Woo-hoo.  Woo-hoo.  Great.  You know, we've taken a lot of the lame-os.  We've taken guys that weren't even in the storyline.  And Vince is in the news now for something more than just promoting a pay-per-view.  Yeah, we get them on the phone when they have a show to promote. 
[00:59:00]  You know, they got a, a, a Raw in New York or something, and they want to promote that.  Oh, they'll send people.  But now that Vince is in the news for other things, you know, the whole XFL controversy,  whether it's going to float or not, the Bob Costas thing, now he's hot other than just,  uh, WWF, and now we won't see him.  And put him on shows that hasn't said one thing, uh, about Vince or the XFL or WWF. 
[00:59:30]  I don't know.  Well, we got to, we got to start putting our foot down.  That's right, Opie.  We've been used for, for over two and a half years by many people.  Used and abused.  Uh, Adam, yes.  Uninstitutional.  My God.  All right, Anthony.  Well, we'll see what happens.  Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, is this Opie Anthony?  Yeah.  Hey, Jeff, I'm on the way down there.  I'm coming down with this girl.  She's got a Catholic school uniform on. 
[01:00:00]  She's wearing a plaid skirt, thigh highs, black shirt.  She's got a thong on that I can't believe.  I just wanted to get everybody all psyched out for it.  Oh, cool.  For the best ass contest.  What's that?  Yeah, it's for the best ass contest.  Yeah, ladies, you can still come down this week, okay?  Yeah.  Come down.  All right.  Absolutely.  We'll be there in a half hour.  Sounds great.  Can't wait.  Thank you.  We get Mule Juice McQueen.  Yeah, great.  Thank you.  I was trying to remember.  Yeah.  Mule Juice McQueen.  Whatever the hell his name was.  No, we get Chris Jericho, but he doesn't want to be Chris Jericho that day.  Right.  Well, we play along with the cute little gag. 
[01:00:30]  Does Vince want to come in as Frank Zappa?  I don't care as long as he comes in as somebody.  I don't care what he wants to change his friggin' name to.  Come in.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Crawl around like a dog.  That's him talking to us.  Maybe if we crawl around the floor and beg, will he come in and do the show?  That's it.  Yeah, I think he's talking to you here.  Pick your balls and kick it off now. 
[01:01:00]  Joel.  Great.  I'm wondering what color panties you're wearing tonight.  Well, Vince, they're red.  A little crotchless number.  My junk's hanging out.  Got a yam bag hanging out the left side.  Looks like it's a hot day.  Looks like melted Turkish taffy.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What a miscarriage of justice is going on here, the way you two guys have been treated.  We've been taking it for way too long from too many people. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Some serious decisions have got to be made in the next two and a half months.  Let me tell you, if you look at the history with Vince McMahon,  you've had guys like Hulk Hogan, the Macho Man,  and guys who have had long, long, year-in-year relationship,  and Vince has completely screwed those guys over,  what's to say, why isn't Vince going to screw you two guys over?  He'll screw anybody over.  And then he'll say, Opie and Anthony screwed Opie and Anthony. 
[01:02:00]  All right, Paul, thank you.  It's like a storyline.  Opie and Anthony screwed Opie and Anthony.  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, listen.  F those guys, you know?  You've been giving those guys so much light for so much time,  and every time you would like you, it was almost like you were sucking up to me.  We give, we give, and we give, and we give, and we give.  I don't even know how you guys, it's like it insults my intelligence,  that whole WF stuff, whatever the hell it is.  I don't think we've ever said no to the WWF. 
[01:02:30]  No, never.  But every once in a while.  Every time you would do something, I would say,  how are these guys even?  Every once in a while, we want to be thrown a bone.  When, like, China was promoting her book, she didn't come on our show.  When Stone Cold comes to town, he doesn't come on our show.  None of these guys come on our show.  They throw us the guys that are kind of,  they throw us guys that we have nothing to really talk about.  That's who they're going to, you know that.  That gets dumped out of, my friend.  Yeah.  Just like this guy hoops on the instant feedback. 
[01:03:00]  Because it gets dumped out of, ass F.  Jesus.  What is Carmen saying?  Carmen, what's up?  You're acting like a bunch of screaming queens.  What the hell is going on?  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  All right, that's screaming queens.  Now, all right, Carmen, Carmen, Carmen,  because we give everyone, you know, equal time here. 
[01:03:30]  Explain yourself.  Yeah.  Explain myself what you guys are the little fish in the pond.  Oh, man.  That got dumped out of, too.  Whatever.  Of course.  We'll see what happens in two and a half months.  If you guys are asses.  We'll see what happens in two and a half months.  You're listening.  Let go.  You're listening.  You're listening, right?  We're from New York, Carmen, you twat.  We're from New York, twat.  Your mother's a twat?  Hey, Carmen.  Yeah, my mother's a twat.  You hate us so much.  And in the nuthouse.  You hate us so much.  You're listening.  Oh, this is that chick from last week. 
[01:04:00]  Remember her?  She listens all the time.  She calls up because she says,  Your mother's in the nuthouse.  That's a twat.  I remember you.  And you're still listening.  I thought you weren't listening to us anymore, Carmen.  What happened?  You can't stop listening.  You're in Kenya.  Hello?  You filthy whore.  You filthy stinkhole.  That's what you are.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, yeah.  The radio gods got that guy, this thing, man, the other day, too. 
[01:04:30]  And the one dude, Don, wasn't even there.  And Mike doesn't even know how to carry an interview.  Was that in studio?  Yeah, he was in studio with Mike.  So why is everyone getting Vince McMahon except us?  That's it.  Don.  Don with WWF.  Don.  I don't know.  You guys are being used.  You know why?  Because we're too nice when it comes to a lot of things.  I didn't like the WWF anyway.  Let me tell you something.  I'm looking at pictures of the Hitmen game from Saturday.  The O and A section that we sold was the only section that had people in it. 
[01:05:00]  Did you see those pictures?  There's our fans standing there taking pictures.  It's up on a website.  They are the only people at Giant Stadium.  We've done plenty.  And now we're getting the big F and C up the A.  We're just too nice.  Too nice when it comes to a lot of fun.  Two and a half months to go.  Two and a half months to go.  Two and a half months to go.  Two and a half months to go. 
[01:05:30]  Look at this guy.  F is dumping out.  There you go.  All right.  Am I back on the air?  There.  I just said it.  Ass F.  Go ahead.  There.  I said it.  Did you hear it?  No.  You don't understand how this works, do you?  Frigging people are asses.  Well, we're done. 
[01:06:00]  WWF.  Done.  Thank you.  Don't come running in here with a cute WrestleMania package.  We're not going.  Nope.  We're done.  Save your trips.  Save your trips.  We're not talking about WWF.  Done.  What's up, Frig?  Oh, I thought you were on the phone.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  Did you hear on Bob Costas? 
[01:06:30]  They said Vince was saying that he had nothing to do with the XFL game day show.  When Bob said it was like a trashy show, he just totally denied it.  Did you hear that?  Mm-hmm.  That's what we wanted to ask him about.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, we wanted to ask him a few things about that interview, but obviously we're not going  to, uh, we thought, uh, we, we said everything we were going to say the other day, but basically  he kicked Costas' ass, but we, we did have a problem with that and we were going to ask  him about it.  Unbelievable, guys.  Now we're not going to get the chance to.  All right, Tom. 
[01:07:00]  All right, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Uh, Mike, what's going on?  You son of a bitch is, how are you?  All right.  So, uh, this is the Radio Chick Show or this is the ONA show, man?  I don't get it.  You guys sound like women whining, man.  Are you kidding me?  Do your show and get on with, bro.  We're whining.  This is our show.  This is what we do.  This is part of what we do.  All right, so you don't get Vince, man.  So you get three other popular stars, man.  You know, don't battle with this guy.  All right.  It's time to make a stand.  All right. 
[01:07:30]  I hear you, man, but, I mean, it's like, you know, bitching about it's not going to  get to nowhere.  It's time to make a stand on a lot of things.  That's what you don't get, Mike.  This isn't just a little thing about Vince.  It's about, uh, finally, you know, having it.  We've had it.  You guys are big enough to go just about anywhere, in my opinion.  You know what I mean?  Well, that's very obvious to a lot of people, so we'll see what happens.  You guys rule, man.  Later, Diamond Dust.  You didn't get it.  It's not just about the Vince thing.  Yeah.  Time to put our foot down. 
[01:08:00]  That's right.  We're not even battling.  We told him he's, you know.  All right.  Our guest is waiting to come on the air.  Yeah.  Guess.  He's a friend of ours, and he hasn't been here in a while.  Yeah.  It's been a while.  We'll be back.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7-Rick.  Because a lot of these guys think we do cute little bits and stuff.  Call him up now and tell him nobody from the WWF will be on the show.  All right.  Unless we get Vince McMahon on, and even that is kind of like, now I'm just like, even if they say he can come on, I don't know. 
[01:08:30]  Wouldn't it have been nice to ask him a couple of questions about that interview?  Would have been nice to talk to China about her book and her spread.  Would have been nice to talk to, you know, Mankind when he was doing his book tour.  Would have been nice when Stone Cold Steve Lawson came to town.  Would have been nice way back when Sable came to town.  We got none of that.  We get Ivory, who was a cool chick and all, but what are we going to do with that?  We get Road Dogg, you know, a week after he's out of rehab. 
[01:09:00]  And he's not even part of the storyline.  We get Al Snow.  We get Al Snow on the phone.  Al Snow on the phone when he's not, he was promoting a pay-per-view that he had nothing to do with.  He wasn't even going to be involved in that.  Right.  We had Chris Jericho when he was playing another character.  A character that went nowhere.  Mule Juice McQuack.  So they've got to understand at this point, it's not this isolated incident.  They've been doing this to us over and over and over again.  You know? 
[01:09:30]  We take all the fringe, we take all the fringe, we take all the fringe, you know, guys in the WWF hoping to get one of the big guys.  Why is Dyson on the phone?  Oh, that's great.  We haven't talked to Dyson in a while.  We'll talk to him and then someone's coming in the studio as well.  It's a good show today.  Oh, my God. 
[01:10:00]  And then we've got John Norris on MTV.  Someone's got to tell John that that toupee's not working.  He's got the snap-on hair now.  I think it's different colors.  But we're trying to figure out what he's doing.  Because it's, is it a full hair helmet?  Yes, it's a full hair helmet.  Or is it a half hair helmet?  I think he has different types.  Full hair helmet.  But then in the other show he did, he had something else going on.  It was an earlier thing.  You put bolts on the side of his neck and he looks like young Frankenstein. 
[01:10:30]  Grandpa.  Grandpa.  Here's a spot.  Lily, I have to go to the parlor.  Everybody's always going to work down at the parlor.  All right.  Eddie, Eddie.  Come down from that tree, Eddie.  Marilyn.  Piece of ass.  What does Falco want?  He's listening to syndication on the ground from Florida. 
[01:11:00]  Falco.  Guys.  They're commissars in town.  First of all, I want to be known today as Yambag Yagoski, not Falco.  I'm going to be someone different, like Chris Jericho.  All right, Falco.  But quick question.  I wanted to tell you guys, like I told Anthony a couple months ago,  in reference to McMahon and all these other gods, whether it's the radio gods,  all you guys do is give everyone their props, you're cool with everyone,  and they crap all over you.  I'm sick of it.  I just wanted to throw that in, man.  Thank you.  I mean, you guys gave, when certain people, all certain people would say was, 
[01:11:30]  well, all I want is the respect, and you guys gave respect,  and even your own people don't respect you.  I'm just totally sick of it, and I'm 2,000 miles away, and I've got it.  Falco, our own company doesn't respect you.  That's what I'm saying.  You guys did everything.  You're doing everything proper.  You're giving the proper respect, and you guys get nothing back.  It's just utterly ridiculous, and I just have to throw my two cents in and say,  it's worse than Norris' toupee.  All right.  Thank you, Falco.  Guys, take care, man.  Come down to Florida.  It's better.  All right.  Later.  Bye.  Oh, sorry about that.  Tim, what's going on? 
[01:12:00]  We've got to take a break, though.  Guys, guys, you're really pissing me off here.  Why?  Remember a year and a half ago, you guys got shut out of the WWF restaurant?  Yes.  You swore the WWF off at that point in time.  And we...  Now, Opie, hold on.  Lo and behold...  We stuck with our work for a really long time.  No, a couple...  Maybe two months later, you had the rock in.  And then the rock pissed you guys off, and you swore them off again.  Right.  So what are we doing, guys?  Are we, like, giving a little radio tease here?  Is this like a wrestling match with a good guy, bad guy?  No, no.  Or are we cutting ties for good?  No, you watch. 
[01:12:30]  You watch.  Okay, I'm sticking by you.  You watch.  All right.  You guys are men.  No more WWF talk.  I'm going to hold you to it.  No more XFL talk.  Excellent.  Nothing.  Good.  Let's move on, then.  All right.  Let's get with the show.  Thank you.  Later, guys.  Bye.  We can talk until we're blue in the face.  Our actions will speak for us.  All right?  That's it.  That's it.  Yes.  For now, forever, whatever.  We'll see how it plays out.  But that's it.  Mm-hmm.  All right, Anthony. 
[01:13:00]  All right.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Quick break.  We'll be back with Dice and someone outside the studio.  Old friends stopping by.  It's another Opie and Anthony Rose show.  This Thursday night is a Vanderbilt.  It's in Plainview, Long Island.  Stores open at 6.  O&A will be there after the show.  21 and older only.  Get directions and other info on WNEW.com.  1-0-2-7.  W-NEW.  It's kind of like a car wreck on the highway.  You're going to have to tune us in to see what the hell these idiots are doing next. 
[01:13:30]  Opie and Anthony.  We refuse to be responsible.  So go screw yourself.  We refuse to be responsible.  1-0-2-7.  W-E.  What?  What happened with that?  Yeah, that sounded a little weird, huh?  Whoa.  It's a new station called W-E-W.  W-E-W. 
[01:14:00]  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  It's the O&A show on WNEW.  Ass Contest still happening today.  No contestants have shown up yet.  One's on the way, dressed as a little Catholic schoolgirl.  It's always fitting.  On the phone, Andrew Dice Clay.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, which way now?  What?  What's right?  What?  What'd you say?  Which way? 
[01:14:30]  Meeting the world done.  Anthony explained.  Which way?  Anthony explained that whole thing the other day.  Which way?  Anthony explained what?  Which way why?  No, not which way why.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Uh, medium.  Nah.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Uh, well done.  Eh.  Well.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  I gotta know.  The way I like it.  Medium rare. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, right.  Hey.  You see what I mean, Opie?  What does that mean?  That's what you do now.  Medium or well done?  Simple question.  That's what you do now.  But why?  Rare.  Eh.  What?  There's only one answer?  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Opie, you're a smart guy.  Medium.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium rare.  Right.  How come Anthony knows the answer?  That was me who knew the answer. 
[01:15:30]  Opie, I gotta know now.  Yeah.  I only ask one more time.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Uh, medium rare.  Yeah, right.  That's me twice the wrong.  What does that even mean?  Dice, what does that mean?  How do you like to say it?  It's simple.  It's self-explanatory.  Why do you even ask that?  And why is medium...  What's so good about medium rare?  Yeah, right.  Medium rare is where it's at.  I understand.  What are you talking about?  I understand perfectly.  What if you like medium well because of the mad cow disease? 
[01:16:00]  Or the foot and mouth thing?  Dang.  No, huh?  How do you even know what I'm talking about?  I don't know what you're talking about.  You say medium...  Now you're guessing something that you don't even know what you're getting involved in.  I just know...  This is where I stand now.  I know I like...  See, that's where it falls apart for me.  I know I like medium rare.  You're right.  Well, what are you talking about?  All I did was ask a question.  Yeah, it's an interesting question.  I haven't talked to you in a while. 
[01:16:30]  I was thinking about it.  I call in.  I say, which way medium or well done?  And you're going, that's the only way you like it?  Dice, what about you?  Which way you like?  How do you like it?  How do I like what?  How do you like it?  You didn't ask the question.  Medium or well done?  No, you didn't ask the question.  How do you like it?  No, that's not it.  How do you take it?  No.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Which way?  Which way?  He doesn't even answer it.  I ask the question now.  Which way?  Medium or well done, Dice?  No, no.  I said it. 
[01:17:00]  All right.  Medium rare.  All right.  Let's knock it off.  I haven't talked to you in a bad...  But we want to know...  I want to know how you like it.  Yeah.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Well, you.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  You're not saying it right.  How do you...  If you're going to ask a question, you've got to say it the right way.  Dice, which way?  Medium or well done?  That's going to pull the plot for me.  I don't mind answering the question.  Which way?  But you've got to say it the right way.  I got it the right...  Hubba, hubba.  I got it the right way.  Hubba, hubba, hubba.  Dice, I got it.  I got it.  Here it is.  All right.  Go ahead.  Which way do you like it? 
[01:17:30]  No, no, no.  Right?  Dice, which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium rare?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  No, uh-uh.  No, I said it to you.  You said what?  You said what to who?  No, I didn't say this is where I stand.  That's what I said.  All right.  Listen.  Yeah.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Well done.  No, you've got to say it quick.  Well done. 
[01:18:00]  Eh.  That's a nah on that.  Medium rare?  Medium rare?  That's a nah.  Medium rare?  That's a nah.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium rare.  Right?  You see what I mean now?  No.  How did you understand that?  You're insane.  How am I insane when you didn't know the answer?  Why do you just start a conversation with you?  Why is it that every time I call you, I ask you a simple thing and you don't have a simple answer?  That it's got to turn into a whole thing.  I don't know what's wrong with medium. 
[01:18:30]  Tyson, I have a feeling you have problems.  I don't have a problem.  You have a little problem there.  I had a nice weekend.  You had a good weekend?  Yeah, I was in Vegas.  My butt butter was flying all over the joint.  Everybody was laughing.  You know what I mean?  What's butt butter?  Eh?  Butt butter.  That's radio terminology for Benoit Ball Blaster.  You know what I'm talking about.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I think.  Yeah.  All right.  So what'd you do?  Because remember you called me for that love advice. 
[01:19:00]  Did I call?  I called you to say hi and you weren't home.  No, not you.  Why?  No, you called me.  I was in Vegas.  Right.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium or error, obviously.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, okay.  You see what I'm saying?  I see it now.  You know, but I told Anthony I was in Vegas.  All right.  So isn't it funny you called me when I was there?  Well, that means Anthony and I aren't communicating.  I didn't.  Well, how come?  What's going on?  I didn't know you were in Vegas.  You called me.  By the way, Dice, who gave you my number? 
[01:19:30]  What do you mean?  How did you get my new phone number?  I moved.  I had to reach out.  How'd you get it?  I had to reach out.  To who?  Not to who.  To what?  Who gave you my number?  Because I left strict instructions not to give Dice my new number.  He didn't give me anything.  Who gave it?  Rick?  Who?  Gave you my new phone number.  He's the doctor.  You know what I'm talking about.  Come on now.  Why can't we ever get anything straight?  Why is he the doctor? 
[01:20:00]  Who's the doctor?  Rick?  Not Rick.  Who's the doctor?  Dice, who gave...  Doctor who?  Who gave you my phone number?  It's a simple question.  I had to reach out.  Reach out to who?  No.  Who wouldn't even know?  Do you understand?  And I'm not doing a routine.  That's his name.  I thought you were doing a little Aberdeen Costello there.  No, doctor who?  Doctor who?  Yeah, but he don't know you.  So I don't know where you'd bring him up.  I think Rick gave you my number.  No, Rick didn't give anything. 
[01:20:30]  I haven't even talked to Rick.  It wasn't me.  I reached out.  That's all I'm saying.  That's all I'm allowed to say over the air.  All right.  You know what I mean?  I don't know who could have gotten the number.  If we learned anything through history.  Hey, keep quiet.  I'm on the phone.  Can't you see I'm talking to somebody?  Get out of here.  Who's that?  My wife.  Who what?  The last lady.  Huh?  Yeah, but she's starting to end.  She came in.  She wanted keys for something.  Who was it? 
[01:21:00]  Norton?  No.  A boyfriend.  Who was it?  Jay Moore gave you my number?  No.  Oh, your number?  You're still on your number?  Yeah, who gave the number?  Was it Jay?  Let me ask you this now.  Jay Moore did.  Let me ask you this.  Yeah.  Okay?  Why?  Why are you asking me now?  Because now I want to know who gave you the number.  For an hour, you call me up.  How do I keep things going?  I know you're with the same girl for years.  Call me up.  You remember?  Guys, I wouldn't even know where to call you.  What do you mean you wouldn't know where to call me?  You call me all the time.  I wrapped up in a thrilling game of EverQuest, and you call up, and I have to cradle the phone 
[01:21:30]  in my shoulder up so I can play.  How fast did you get naked during that game?  It's not a naked game.  It's not a naked game.  You were playing this with your girlfriend?  It's an online game.  Were you playing this with your girlfriend?  It's on the computer, Dice.  Yeah.  Was she playing, too?  No.  And she was fully clothed.  She didn't take nothing off.  Yeah, what am I supposed to have sex when Dice is on the phone?  No, no, no.  You've got to go, and I'm like four-play for you.  What an erection kryptonite that is. 
[01:22:00]  All you've got to do is think about me, and everybody gets excited about everything.  I can't even have one of your movies on the TV on the couch when we're trying to go at it.  Why not?  Because you're like a erectile kryptonite.  You look up all of a sudden, hey, that's all it's about.  That's all marriage and relationships are about.  That's what it's bad, though, about.  You've got to constantly be on them.  Having people in show business that you know, because you ever try to do something on the  couch with your girl, and all of a sudden, I turn on Comedy Central, and there's Adam Ferrara. 
[01:22:30]  Hey, pal, I see your ass.  You're naked, pal.  You're going to want to see that.  Yeah, but it's like you remember all my life.  It's Jay Moore in a dress, you know, which is kind of hot.  But, you know, you don't want to sit in there while you're trying to get your F on.  Are you trying to say Jay Moore in a dress is hot?  I don't know if you're going to go make up.  I want to ask.  Say that again.  Adam Ferrara isn't Diamond Dice Gray.  Well, you can say that again.  You've got to know how to keep it going.  That's all I was trying to explain to you last night. 
[01:23:00]  Who said what?  You know what I mean?  No, I didn't say who said what, and who had nothing to do with it.  You know what I mean?  That's a whole different situation.  When you say, you know what I mean, I can always answer no.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  So, you know, you've got to constantly keep balls coming at them.  That's all I'm saying.  You've got to be on them from the minute they move in with you.  You can't let them start.  Bring them in the broom closet.  Yeah.  And I'm going, oh, oh, look, it's not rising the way I would like it to.  Do me a favor, you know what I mean? 
[01:23:30]  Caress it a little.  And then when it's done, go feed the turkey to the family.  You know what I mean?  Not at all.  You know what I mean?  They wake up in the morning, what's the first thing somebody does?  They wake up, they yawn, right?  Yeah.  So the banana goes right in our mouth.  You've got to be prepared.  You've got to sleep with your head at that seat.  So when they hug you in the middle of the night, the banana goes right in our mouth.  You see what I mean?  That's romance.  That's showing a girl, I'm always thinking about you. 
[01:24:00]  Of course, nice.  You know what I mean?  You send them a nice card.  Remember when you drank my goo from a cup?  I'm sorry.  Please let's make up, that kind of thing.  You know what I mean?  Wow.  Sure.  Romantic dog.  And it's always just coming at them.  They don't breathe.  You break the light like in the shower or something so when they get in in the morning, you're already ready.  You're like in the corner.  You know what I mean?  Hey, good morning.  Bend the cat over here.  Now you're a filthy animal. 
[01:24:30]  Ain't tight.  And then you say to her when it's all over, right?  Yeah.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium rare.  Right.  Now you understand.  Dice, I've got to be careful with this.  Dave on line eight.  He wants to know if you've had a stroke recently.  What?  What happened?  What?  I'm actually coming in there to see you guys soon again.  Yeah, I hear that.  Yeah, huh?  We're looking forward to that.  Yeah, I've got the Westbury gig coming up.  You know that.  Westbury music.  A dice in the round.  In April, right?  Yeah, April 13th and 14th. 
[01:25:00]  April 13th and 14th?  Yeah.  Another dice appearance.  You got a call waiting because something clicked in there.  I have to tell him how handsome he is.  What happened?  I haven't told Dice how handsome he is.  Oh, I am getting beeped.  So I have to call him and tell him he's handsome.  I'm getting beeped.  All right.  All right, Dice.  I'm getting beeped.  What do you want us to do about it?  You're going to hang or you want to go?  What do you want to do?  Well, tell him, when's your Westbury?  13th and 14th of April.  Westbury is April 13th and 14th.  It's on sale now. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  It's going to be another spectacular.  And I don't know why people say things like that.  There's something wrong with me.  Are you doing the Dice in the Round thing, though?  Is the stage...  Yeah, Dice in the Round.  And why is the guy using my yambag line?  We love the yambag.  The guy that called in.  No, we came up...  We've totally stolen yambag.  Yeah, we came up with it.  Have you really?  We'll fess up to it.  Yeah, we stole it.  Do you understand how difficult it is to keep coming up with terminology?  For you?  Dice, we came up with that one.  No, I came up with that.  When the yambag is banging against the hairy taco... 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, remember when you were in here?  You remember?  And that was online?  Remember when we were saying yambag and you took it and then you used it the next time you were here?  The yambag is mine!  Yambag is ours!  No, yambag is mine, my friend.  No, you got butt butter.  Butt butter is yours.  Butt butter is yours.  Yambag is ours.  No, no, no.  But they're both mine.  We can trade if you like.  We'll take butt butter and you can have yambag back.  Yeah, but you ever meet a chick with assitis? 
[01:26:30]  What's assitis, then?  You get it from mad cow disease.  I never heard of assitis.  What are the symptoms?  Well, you know, it's like faggotitis.  Only if you go with a cow.  I don't get it.  Get what?  What is it?  It's a disease.  It's spreading from the whole mad cow disease thing.  Hey, you know, you're in bed with mine, you son of a bitch.  Yeah, all right.  Wait, don't start with the buttons.  You're stealing from a puppet.  Don't start with the buttons.  I'm a puppet. 
[01:27:00]  Get in the coffin.  Get in the coffin.  Die.  Die.  All right, stop with the buttons.  I hate when you do the buttons.  Die.  Get in the coffin.  You know how I hate the buttons.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium rare.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Faggot.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium rare.  Yeah, right.  Don't forget, my friend.  I'm Pusa.  Yam bag is art.  No, Yam bag.  You know what?  I'll give you Yam bag.  How's that?  And we're going to take butt butter, too, if you don't watch it. 
[01:27:30]  No, you can't take butt butter.  I can't keep coming up with these things.  You know, like...  Hey, why don't you take leather Cheerios, too, you see?  Stop with the noise.  Stop with the noise now.  Get in the coffin.  I haven't talked to you for a while.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I'm going to put some butt butter on my...  I can't even say the word that I was looking for.  Leather Cheerio.  That was an Asoleen.  Asoleen.  You like that one?  You like that one?  I'll take that one. 
[01:28:00]  All right, but I want your Yam bag back.  No, we're going to trade for that one.  I'll trade you Asoleen.  We'll give you a...  The Yam bag.  Asoleen.  Trading my material, sir.  Trading mine, sir.  Get in the coffin.  We'll take Asoleen.  Asoleen.  Asoleen's nice, right?  Yeah.  Asoleen.  We'll give you butt butter back.  Like if you're having that kind of...  How do you say it?  Anthony, say it.  Like what I mean.  What?  You know, like if you're having that kind of backdoor action. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, like backdoor action.  Now what are you giving her?  Asoleen.  Asoleen.  Yeah.  Well, no, you need the Asoleen before you do that.  No, no.  No, no.  That's a different thing.  That, you know, that's spit.  You know, Asoleen is what comes from your three-piece set.  Asoleen.  That's a good one.  No talent, faggot.  George.  Who's this?  What do I got to deal with this?  That's George from Otto and George.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Are they up there? 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  That's not nice.  He's a little shy, though.  You ever see him, the puppet guy?  I haven't talked to him in a while.  Yeah, wait, you'll lose my number.  Lose it.  No, he's not.  This is sampling stuff.  Because Otto does talk once in a while.  He doesn't want to talk today.  How come?  I don't know.  You want butt butter back?  We'll take Asoleen.  You like it?  You're thinking about Asoleen.  You could have the butt butter back.  You're thinking about Asoleen.  You know what?  I'm going to give you some time to think about this.  We keep Yam bag. 
[01:29:30]  We keep banana juice.  No, banana juice is mine.  Well, no one knows that anymore.  Banana juice?  What are you talking about?  It's on the album.  We've used it so much, now they think it's ours.  So we're going to keep that one.  See, you're going through a whole thing today about respect.  So I understand where you're coming from.  Just take Balloon Knot and take the trifecta.  All three.  Get in the coffin.  We'll give you...  We can trade you F-Tard.  No, that's no good.  I've got to keep Butt Butter.  I've got to keep Asoleen.  I'm going to give you Yam bag because that's getting kind of old. 
[01:30:00]  Keep them all, sir.  Who cares?  No, you get Butt Butter back.  That's not the puppet.  I know Otto and George, and I know what a stupid puppet sounds like.  Why are you doing that?  It's not the puppet.  It's the puppet.  I know what the puppet sounds like.  The puppet came in here, and the puppet is...  It's not the puppet.  It's not what the puppet sounds like.  The puppet has the flu.  Let the puppet say something.  The puppet came here without Otto.  Now he doesn't want to say anything.  You insulted him. 
[01:30:30]  That's not the puppet.  That's Madam.  Who's Madam?  Hail and flowers and Madam?  That's not the puppet they used to put on television.  That guy's dead as a doorknob, isn't he?  Yeah, but the puppet's not.  Hey, that's funny.  You're calling me a faggot?  Oh.  I'm no faggot, sir.  All right.  What?  Is it Otto?  Is that you?  Otto's not here.  George is here.  Just the puppet.  It's just the puppet.  Otto's the puppet.  See, that's what happens with every great team. 
[01:31:00]  Sooner or later, they start arguing.  They break up.  One wants to go their own way, do their own stuff.  You know what I mean?  It's amazing that the puppet is here by himself.  Now, I know what you're saying.  Yeah.  He's over there, I'm over here, and this is where I stand, because that's where it falls apart for me.  He's a junkie.  Die.  That's not Otto's puppet.  That puppet is way too mean.  That puppet's got a death sentence.  It's the puppet. 
[01:31:30]  It's not the puppet.  It's the puppet without Otto.  You know my puppets, my friend.  It's not the puppet.  It's the puppet without Otto.  I know my puppets.  And we're keeping banana juice, and we're keeping, um, what was the other one?  Hey, you've got to remember now.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Now I've got to confuse you.  Which way, medium or well done?  Medium.  Rare.  Damn.  No, you can't split it.  You have to have the single answer.  We tricked you.  Ah, see?  We tricked you.  We tricked you.  Look at the way to trick you. 
[01:32:00]  We just tricked you.  He said medium, I said rare.  That was the right answer.  You didn't get the answer, my friend.  That was the right answer.  No, that wasn't the right answer.  I didn't give the answer.  It's the response you're going for here.  Let's do it normal now.  All right.  All right, because then I'm going to go.  I'll let you do what you've got to do with what you've got.  Okay.  Okay?  All right.  Medium or well done.  Your ass smells like hot garbage.  No, wrong.  Wrong.  Hot garbage.  Gringed mustard.  I'll give you a crack over your frigging head.  You'll be part of my fireplace.  You don't shut your mouth. 
[01:32:30]  Eat me, sir.  Eat me.  Eat me, sir.  I got to say, eat me, puppet.  All right.  Let her finish with it.  Okay.  All right.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  All right.  You ready?  Medium or well done.  Get in the coffin.  Wrong.  Medium or well done.  Muzzle George for a minute.  We've got to finish with it.  Tell yourself.  No, George.  Tell yourself, sir.  George.  Ah, poofah.  George, relax.  Ah, poofah.  Is that a work in that puppet?  Yes. 
[01:33:00]  He is there.  Yes.  It's not just the puppet doing his own thing.  Well, it's just the puppet.  Yeah, you're a real whiz.  Stupid son of a bitch.  All right.  Go ahead.  Die.  Die.  Die, sir.  All right.  Let's, uh, dice.  I don't get a lot of bent to banger.  Don't you feel that?  Dice.  Everything's very negative.  See, I call in all happy.  Dice, explain.  Give us.  Because you're a retard.  Give us the question.  Happy as a retard, sir.  Well, that's one puppet's opinion.  Dice, give us the question. 
[01:33:30]  No, no, I'm not doing it.  I did it ten times.  You didn't do it right.  But the puppet got you pissed now.  No, but, you know, just the fact I'm having an argument with a puppet.  Don't let the puppet get you pissed.  No, no, but the puppet's, like, hurt my feelings.  It keeps saying things to, like, uh, that's what we're doing.  All right, we'll keep the puppet out of this.  Go ahead.  All right.  All right, you ready?  Yeah, we want to finish on it up now.  All right, which way?  Medium or well done?  Eat my ass.  Oh, see, he did it again.  That's not right. 
[01:34:00]  You know what I mean?  And I feel kind of stupid talking to something that really doesn't even exist.  You know what I mean?  I want to hear Otto's voice.  I don't care if he talks a lot.  I've got to know it's him because that's the only puppet person I talk to.  He's not here.  Just George came in.  I don't understand this.  What happened with them?  I don't know.  It's his new thing.  It's just he sends George out and he stays home.  It's his new thing.  Kind of like that whole medium rare thing.  And this is what Otto's doing now.  He went out to buy crack and the pigs ate him. 
[01:34:30]  Fucking junkie.  Let me ask you guys.  Does he ever talk like as him?  No.  He never talks?  No.  Not lately because this is the new thing.  This is what he does now.  Just a puppet.  Yeah, just a puppet.  Does he normally ask puppets?  Like, he asks the puppet questions.  No, he's just looking at us now.  And the puppet is kind of like looking at us.  No, he asks the puppet a question.  The puppet answers.  That's what he used to do.  That's usually what happens.  But he's not here.  So now the puppet's just on his own.  Right.  And the puppet... 
[01:35:00]  You know what?  The puppet needs Otto back because he's getting very angry.  The puppet's eyes are just moving around the room.  What's the problem with the puppet?  The puppet's not getting enough work?  See, the puppet needs to go.  Well, George is doing fine on his own.  Right.  No, I don't think George is doing too good, I'll tell you the truth.  The puppet's doing fine.  And why are we referring to an inadequate object as a person? 
[01:35:30]  Look, I don't know, Dice.  Why would we do that?  I don't know.  Okay, look.  Why would three mature adults like us do that?  Sure.  All right, finish up.  All right, you ready?  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  I got to gear up.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Why is nothing happening when I say that?  I was thinking of the answer.  What do you mean you were thinking of the answer?  I taught you the answer.  Oh, all right.  We've gone over this a thousand times today already.  Which way?  Medium or well done? 
[01:36:00]  A pusser.  No, wrong.  All right, the brain-damaged leather-clad freak.  You see what I mean?  Here he goes again.  The puppet just keeps getting angrier.  It's not my fault the puppet don't get work.  I know what Otto's thinking.  Otto's doing, like, the teller thing, you know?  Uh-huh.  What's Otto doing?  He's working, day job, the whole thing?  Otto is, like, doing teller now.  Doesn't need to talk.  He's giving PJs for crack money. 
[01:36:30]  I can't believe he won't talk.  Otto, is that you?  Or is it the black puppeteer guy?  It's just the puppet.  No, there's another guy.  There's Willie and his puppet, whatever it is.  Oh, my God.  Willie and his puppet.  The black puppet.  Willie and Lester.  Willie and Lester.  The black puppet guy.  You ever hear those guys?  That's a puppet act.  That's a puppet act.  He makes that puppet talk out of every hole in its body.  I kind of like the peanut guy. 
[01:37:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Does Otto know Willie and Lester?  Did they ever get together, double date, that kind of thing?  I don't know.  Maybe when Otto comes in, he can tell us.  You want to ask George, though?  The black puppet robbed me.  I'm not talking to the puppet anymore.  Well, he's talking to Otto.  I wouldn't talk to Otto, but I won't talk to Otto.  The black puppet robbed me once, sir.  What happened?  The black puppet robbed me, sir.  Did the black puppet rob you?  Well, you know, he took your best off, because he's doing real good.  All right.  All right.  Look, I don't want to fight with a puppet.  Okay. 
[01:37:30]  You know what I mean?  Well, we have to take a break.  All right.  All right.  Take a break.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium rare.  You're right!  That's what you do now.  All right.  He hung up.  He hung up.  Holy smoke.  Of his mind?  The guy's lost his friggin' mind.  What is that?  Which way?  The bat.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I met Dice Clay when I was eight years old at Rascals and West Orange.  Got his autograph and everything. 
[01:38:00]  The man has just gotten stupider and stupider through the years.  Okay?  Maybe it's that Rogaine he's trying to rub on that balding, freaking melon of a head on top of him.  I don't know.  All right.  He was talking to Otto and George, though.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He was talking to Otto and George.  Yeah.  Oh, and Anthony?  The bat's coming for you, pal.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Shaking up my boots.  Can we take a break so we can get Jay Moore in here?  Yeah.  Jay.  He's been waiting an hour.  We'll talk to Jay next. 
[01:38:30]  Stay there.  Nice, nice, baby.  Nice checking in from over here.  Nice, nice, baby.  Oh, it's so nice.  Nice, nice, baby.  Oh.  Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay,  Nice, nice, baby.  Oh.  Nice, nice, nice.  Oh.  Nice, nice, nice, nice.  Nice, nice, baby.  Gotta love the dice.  Oh.  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, 
[01:39:00]  Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Oh, come on.  Who doesn't love Paisano?  I was there.  Paisano.  This weekend.  Whoa, look at you.  I stopped down and Joey wasn't even there.  So I didn't know who to ask.  I was asking, like, people, hey, Joey, glass of wine, please.  Anthony.  On the house.  You asked for Peter. 
[01:39:30]  I did have Peter as the waiter.  Giovanni on the weekends.  Giovanni on the weekends.  You called me Giovanni.  Peter during the week, Giovanni on the weekends.  Totally hooked me up.  I had the veal marsala.  Veal marsala.  Very good stuff.  And the pasta on the side.  Really good.  Warm, friendly.  You know what I'm digging there lately?  It's the ravioli.  A regular or fried ravioli?  Regular.  Yeah.  The cheese and the meat.  Good stuff.  But the fried ravioli is still your favorite dish here?  Yeah, for an appetizer. 
[01:40:00]  But then I like the veal.  Very good veal at Paisano of Mulberry Street.  The portions are huge, too.  You'll take some home with you.  And they're not just for dinner.  You have the incredible pasta lunch specials over there.  Ask for Joey when he's there.  He's like a figurehead now.  Is that what Joey is now?  You know, it's like every time I'm there, Joey's there.  He's like the Ronald McDonald of Paisanos.  You know?  Sure, they've got the plastic one out in the yard.  But you never see the real Ronald McDonald anymore.  But you can get your picture with Joey.  He's sitting right outside on the bench. 
[01:40:30]  They should make a plastic Joey to just stand at the restaurant waving.  Hi, I'm Joey.  He's like the Dave Thomas of Wendy's.  Does all the commercials and stuff.  But he's never there.  You never see him there.  Dave Thomas is at Wendy's every time I go.  Oh, really?  Sure.  You see the big cardboard cutout of him saying,  thanks for coming by.  Is that him?  A cardboard cutout or a big plastic Joey we need at Paisano of Mulberry Street.  I used to ask for Colonel Sanders.  Colonel Sanders, another one.  When I was young. 
[01:41:00]  You never see.  And now that he's dead, they got him cartoon break dancing.  Because you don't know as a kid.  You think there's one Kentucky Price KFC.  Right.  And he's got to be in here.  Right.  How about Joey in the Box?  Like Jack in the Box, only with Joey.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  When you do see Joey there, say hi.  You get a glass of wine in the house.  Paisano of Mulberry Street, right in the heart of Little Italy.  136 Mulberry.  Call him up.  965-1188.  965-1188.  They're open seven days a week.  Weekend still, too. 
[01:41:30]  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Really fast.  Not part of the commercial, really.  But it is about Paisano.  How many people went with you?  Just me and my girl.  Two people.  How do you work that out?  I know how not to.  Seriously.  How do you do it?  Well, while I'm here.  Are you just like a punk Friday?  I don't go, hey, everybody.  Join me at Paisano tonight.  We'll get a big table, and I'll pay for the homeless people, too.  Last time I was there, there were 18 people at my table, and I couldn't say no to anyone.  Get this, though. 
[01:42:00]  Peter comes over.  He goes, well, there's this girl always in here.  She's in love with Opie.  Stalker.  I go, okay.  Daddy.  He goes, I don't remember her name.  I go, does she go like this?  I'll take the table in the corner.  He goes, that's her.  He goes, that's Pess Stalker Patty.  Oh, she's in love with Opie.  She's here all the time.  Everyone thinks it's a bit.  Yeah.  How the hell is she getting to Paisano on Mulberry Street? 
[01:42:30]  I don't know.  She's there all the time, though, from what I hear.  Just thought I'd let you know.  And she always has to sit in the table that you sit at.  Great.  A special Opie table.  Someone spit in her food next time for me, please.  Steve.  This is not common practice at Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Get one of those.  Ah, pusser.  Ah, pusser.  Get one of those Chinese guys from, you know, across the way that has AIDS and have them spit in her food.  The Chinese guy's laughing. 
[01:43:00]  Sir.  Sir.  All right, we'll be back.  We'll be back with Jay Moore.  WNEW.  The Rack is back.  Catch the Radio Chick, 9 to noon, 1027 WNEW.  Anthony, we're breaking in again because Stalker Patty's on the line, and she's saying that you're lying.  Uh, Patty.  Hi, how you doing?  Hello, Patty.  First, let me turn my radio down.  I should know better.  You should know better.  Yeah, I don't go to Paisano's all the time. 
[01:43:30]  Paisano's.  I probably go there once every six weeks, number one.  I hear Peter says you're there all the time.  Not all the time.  And he knows you love open.  All the time.  The last time I went was about...  Once every six weeks is a lot.  Where are you getting the money for Paisano's?  If I get paid on a Friday and I feel like having a 685 pasta special, like the vegetarian lasagna...  Look, she's all pissed, man.  You're full of pee and vinegar.  What?  I'm listening to you.  You're all fired up. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, I know, because I'm embarrassed.  Why are you embarrassed?  Now?  Yeah, because...  Finally?  Finally.  Finally.  I don't even think that's the only person I talk to...  God, she wasn't embarrassed when Norton felt her up in front of everyone.  She wasn't embarrassed when, like, people are ripping nipple hair off her chest live on her.  She wasn't embarrassed when she showed that veal ass of hers last week.  But now she's embarrassed.  You're funny.  Listen, you don't go there once in a blue moon for a special little treat for myself. 
[01:44:30]  A lot of blue moons.  I do not have to sit in a particular table.  I've been sitting at the same table.  This is a brand new pattern.  Something's happened to you.  Either you've gotten this new self-confidence, or you're off the medication.  And, Patty?  What?  What table do you sit at every time?  It's always, like, the third one from the window.  A little two-seater.  A little two-seater?  Yeah.  Once in a while, I do sit in the back.  In the back.  And who do you bring?  What?  Who do you bring?  Whoever the F I want, I'll be. 
[01:45:00]  Who do I what?  I'm sick of your F and S.  What?  Who do I what?  Patty, curse.  No, I don't curse.  You never curse?  Say the F word.  Say the F word.  Just yell out the F word.  Go ahead.  Why?  Just do it.  I've got to hear it.  Go ahead.  Do it.  It's going to be blocked.  We'll enjoy it.  Just yell the F word.  Yell it?  Yeah, yell the F word right now.  You skanky bitch.  Come on.  Say it.  What?  Say the F word.  Yell it right now.  Uh. 
[01:45:30]  I can't.  Patty, yell it.  Okay.  She didn't even yell it.  She just goes, eh.  Uh.  You will do whatever we say.  That's what the listeners are starting to say.  Yeah, but that's not true about Paisanos.  Let's be fair.  And I only talked to only one person.  I didn't even know who Peter was until just recently.  Who do you bring down to Paisanos on Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy?  Myself. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, big night out.  I bring myself.  It's made of meal.  I eat one of two things.  I like the vegetarian lasagna or the ziti with broccoli.  And Patty, when you go there by yourself, you walk around at, uh, you look around at  all the happy couples enjoying their night out.  Oh, no.  I just sit and enjoy my meal.  By yourself?  Oh.  That's your, the, is that a big night out for you since it's so, it's not expensive, but  I mean, for your.  No, it is.  It's just a little cake for myself.  That's all it is. 
[01:46:30]  Do you see all the couples in love drinking their wine?  Actually, no.  Doing that little, doing that little trick from, uh, that tramp thing, from Lady and  the Tramp, they're each eating the spaghetti off of the same plate.  No, actually, I just sit down in my, my business and just eat.  That's all.  Patty, do you put your knapsack in one of the chairs and name it George Glass?  It's my boyfriend, George Glass.  No, I just put it down.  Do you, do you face the wall so people don't look at you?  No, I don't look at anybody and nobody looks at me. 
[01:47:00]  Do you just kind of look out over the restaurant, though, or we want to,  we want to understand this.  Yeah.  When you eat the spaghetti, do you.  Well, it's a very nice restaurant.  It's got all plants around it and everything.  It's beautiful.  I love its presentation.  Do you talk to one of the plants and pretend it's, uh, the edge from YouTube?  No.  I like that with Caesar.  Do people look at you all sad when that single tear rolls down your cheek  as you're eating alone?  I'm not crying.  Who the hell sees her?  Nobody sees me. 
[01:47:30]  I said, who's Caesar, you bitch?  Well, Caesar, I'm not a bitch, so please don't call me that.  Don't call her that, Opie.  Who's the C word?  Who's Caesar, you?  I didn't know you did that word either.  Geez, I didn't mean it.  Well, I call him Caesar.  His name is pronounced a different way.  I have a hard time for him to get the way to call him Caesar.  Right, fascinating.  Patty?  I call him Caesar.  Patty, when you eat the spaghetti, does it look like the mama bird is regurgitating worms  in your mouth during that skinny pencil neck, just kind of getting the worms down? 
[01:48:00]  No, I don't eat spaghetti.  Doesn't look like that?  No?  Do you have enough?  I'm not a linguine person.  Do you have enough money for dessert or any kind of weenie person?  Virgin, 47 years old.  Do you tip the waiters?  Yes, I do.  I try to tip 25% of the bill because I know what it is to work hard at a restaurant.  20% on $6.95.  Easy come, easy go.  $1.40.  Me a bag of shells, Naughton.  Yes.  Me a bag of shells. 
[01:48:30]  It's 10%, but I said 20% because I work in food, so I understand what they go through.  I just never have anything to spend.  When I had it, we all had it.  My nation to spend.  Patty, turn down the stupid radio.  I just had to go out and turn my burger over on the stove.  I'm talking in another room. 
[01:49:00]  Wait, you're cooking a burger right now?  Yeah, I'm making my dinner as I speak.  Hey, could you do something for us on the radio?  I think it would be kind of cool.  Oh, God, what?  Could you turn on your oven?  Oh, please.  What?  What?  Why are you?  What?  Yeah, well, you think I'm going to stick my head in and asphyxiate myself.  No, I don't think you would die if you did it for just 30 seconds.  I just want to see if you would do it.  How long she can do it?  Yeah.  No, Opie, that I certainly will not honor. 
[01:49:30]  Patty, do it for 15 seconds.  Turn on the stove.  No, Opie, I will not do it.  Okay?  Wow.  I hate you.  He really likes you, Patty.  You can tell by the way he treats you.  Yeah, he is just being funny.  Yeah, real comedian.  Why are they going to believe it?  Patty, do you eat the sausage or are you waiting for the right sausage?  Well, actually, I don't eat sausage. 
[01:50:00]  Of course you don't.  Patty, what floor is your apartment on?  Yeah.  It's not really my apartment.  I'm staying with somebody until I find a place to stay.  The person's helping me out.  How high up are you?  I'm only on the first floor, Opie, in case you think I'm going to open a window and jump out.  Wishful thinking.  Well, we can dream, right?  Yeah, but I know you don't really mean that.  You've got knives in there, right, Patty?  Yeah, but I don't think I'm going to stab myself either.  Just slip one of your wrists. 
[01:50:30]  No.  It doesn't even have to be deep.  Oh, stop it now.  You know I won't do that either.  Yeah.  All right, Patty.  Later.  All right.  Well, have a nice day.  Bye-bye, Patty.  I didn't call to defend myself.  Oh, and a great job you did.  Well, thank you.  Bye-bye, Patty.  Bye.  Bye.  I'll see you at the road show.  Bye.  No, no, no, no.  Don't go to the road show.  How are you getting to the road show?  Oh, I'm taking the train.  I have my tickets already.  Ah.  I'm going to get right online.  I'm getting there early. 
[01:51:00]  Patty, could you put a fork in the socket?  What?  Put a fork in the socket.  I hear it's fun.  Can you wrap the cord around your neck?  Patty, can you bathe with your toaster?  What?  Why are you asking me all those things?  That's terrible.  Bathe with your toaster.  It's fun, I heard.  It's fun, right?  No, not like, oh, please, you know.  No?  No, that doesn't mean things to say to somebody.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:51:30]  You bought your train tickets?  When you go to board it, could you go in front of it?  Oh, you don't really mean that.  Of course not.  I hope not.  Hey, can you run across Queens Boulevard?  I heard they fixed the lights over there.  Just shut your eyes and run.  Yeah, I know you don't really mean that.  No, of course not.  I hope not.  No.  We want to see if you can make it across Queens Boulevard.  No.  They fixed the lights.  No one's dying over there anymore.  You trying to hurt my feelings?  Yes. 
[01:52:00]  Why?  What?  Why would you hurt my feelings?  Because I'm bothered by you.  Patty, you got any industrial cleaners over there?  No.  Oh, stop it.  Anything like Drano?  Anthony, stop it, please.  A shot of Drano goes good with burgers.  No, I don't find that funny.  What are you putting on your burger today?  That?  Well, I'm just going to put a little salt and pepper.  That's about it.  That's it?  Yep.  So you don't have any ketchup?  And I'm not going to put sodium and chlorine in separately either.  Oh, very good.  Look at her. 
[01:52:30]  She knows her chemicals.  I like that.  All right.  Well, later, Patty.  All righty.  I hope you don't really mean those things.  Every word.  Okay, Patty.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Bye.  She's defending herself, Opie.  She doesn't go to Paisano's and sit in your seat and go there on a weekly basis.  No, every six weeks.  Yeah.  But meanwhile, Peter said she was there like days ago.  A couple of days earlier. 
[01:53:00]  That's all.  There you go.  Jay from Jersey.  Bring in the fag already, will you?  Bring in the fag.  Jay Moore's next.  WNEW.  Show of hands.  Believe it or not, you're listening to the number one afternoon drive show in New York City.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Jay Moore in the studio, finally.  Jay.  In the house.  He's been here since 340. 
[01:53:30]  Medium rare.  Medium rare.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Medium.  Uh-uh.  Right.  Right.  You see now?  You guys took him out of his game.  I don't know what that's all about.  I've never seen him taken out of his game before.  I don't know what that's all about.  He was like Iverson shaking Jordan out of his shoes.  He was talking to George.  He was talking to a fake puppet.  I know that's not a real puppet.  That's not the puppet.  Like the puppet would be here talking.  This guy's out of his burn. 
[01:54:00]  Good to see you guys, man.  Jay Moore.  Yes.  Without a doubt.  Well, we've been, uh...  Nothing to promote.  Nothing?  No.  You're not going to be in town somewhere playing or nothing?  No.  Nah.  Uh-oh.  I don't know.  That's not going to happen.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Look at him.  Look at him.  Hi.  It's me.  Are the dates a...  You have to push that door up a little high, you know?  Who be made?  Vito.  Let me get Vito in.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  We're screwed off today.  Hey, listen.  I got an idea for a new video game. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  It's called Frogger Patty.  Frogger Patty.  All right.  We dress Patty up in a frog costume.  It'll be a giant joystick.  And you've got to guide Patty across Queens Boulevard.  That's great.  You know what?  Patty is desperate for money.  We should all come up with, like, $2,000, $3,000 and give it to Patty if she can cross  Queens Boulevard without getting hit.  No.  We'll put her in a frog costume.  Well, we'll put her in the frog costume, of course.  You'd save a lot of money on that frog costume, boy.  All right.  I'm going to go listen to myself.  Take care.  All right, Vito.  I'm going to listen to myself.  At least he's honest. 
[01:55:00]  Vito, you're a fag.  There you go.  We'll see if it's the way they kick in.  Everybody, Vito's a fag.  Vito the tool.  I'm going to go listen to myself because I'm gay.  Now he's listening, and 40 seconds later, this will come up.  Tell it all his friends.  Listen.  Listen to me.  I'll be in Anthony.  I'm a faggy.  Fag.  You're a fag.  Have you ever been a homosexual, sir?  Sir?  Have you ever been a pussy?  Look at a black guy eating fried chicken.  You know why they put sour cream on a burrito?  That's to rub on your ass the next day. 
[01:55:30]  You know fags get turned on by that joke?  I don't think that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hold on.  I've got to get Morgan from my betsywill.com on, too, here.  Morgan.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  How are you?  Hey, I hear you're coming to the road show Thursday.  Yes, we are.  We're going to be there, man.  How cool is that?  There we go.  An opportunity to make some money and watch some people puke.  No, we wouldn't miss it.  But we're going to get you on stage, and you'll get some of the listeners to do some insane stuff for cash, right? 
[01:56:00]  It's going to get a little ugly, I think.  You've got to see this Morgan and the Gang from my betsywill.com live.  It's great.  Cool.  It's very sick.  And you need help with something else?  Yeah.  We're going to be on Sally Jesse tomorrow.  Another very exciting Sally Jesse Raphael.  Sally.  That's still on?  Very special.  Still on?  Yeah.  How did they work?  How did they work your guys' segment into something to do with runaway teens?  It's boot camp.  It's like boot camp.  Are you kidding?  No, it's not.  Because I was going to say, every time that show is on, and I happen to turn it on, 
[01:56:30]  there is Sally and some wayward teens and the boot camp drill sergeant that comes in.  You know, like sizzling and hot garbage.  When you're on there talking about the show, it's going to be great.  No, we got it, we got it.  If that hits the air, it's worse.  You'd be doing this show from the broom closet.  Yeah, really, man.  Put the banana in her mouth.  So you got to sleep, so she opens her mouth.  The banana goes in. 
[01:57:00]  When she yawns.  How you taking medium or boom?  When she yawns.  When she yawns.  You got to get ready for when she yawns.  Yeah.  We need your help, guys.  We need a big, hairy man.  Ugh.  Why?  Because we want to wax him on the show.  Ah.  Yeah, but you know what?  I've seen that, like, on two TV shows already.  Yeah.  Well, this was, this was, this was, uh, you know.  How's that sort of decision?  This was part of, uh, part of a master plan on, uh, on TV's behalf.  The I bet you will stuff we'll say for the road show. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, good.  Okay.  The true I bet you will goodness.  So tell us what, uh, we need to do for you.  So we're looking for a big, hairy guy who, uh, he can call their studio, which is, uh, 800-411-7941.  Like a hatchet wound in the back of an ape.  Exactly.  And the extension is 7415.  Okay.  And we're going to give away, uh, yeah, we'll give something, 250 bucks to come on the show tomorrow.  All right.  All they have to do is call that number.  All they have to do is call that number.  We're going to get them on. 
[01:58:00]  One more time with the number.  The number, once again, 800-411-7941, extension 7415.  7415.  Yeah.  And we're going to be shooting at the garden tonight.  That has a big badge.  And she, and she, and she's like silly putty.  All right, Morgan.  Yeah, and when, uh, we're going to be shooting at the garden tonight.  So everybody who's listening, stop by and see us right up front.  Where are you going to be at the garden tonight?  We're going to be, uh, right up, right up front before the game, right up before the Ranger game.  Well, there's a guy calling that wants to be shaved already.  Yeah, see that? 
[01:58:30]  I hope he's a big, hairy animal.  His name's Jake.  He's a big, hairy Jake.  Hold on.  Let's see how hairy the guy is.  See if he qualifies.  Jake.  I'm a big, hairy guy over here.  Hey, Jake.  Ew.  And I got that sort of a kind of brain.  So you got the hair that Morgan's looking for, huh?  I'm not like big and hairy, but I got chest hair and stomach hair and all that jazz.  Are you, like, when you take off your shirt, does it look like you're still wearing a sweater?  You need the back hair.  I don't got the back hair.  I'll tell you that.  You need big hair, the guy with the hairy shoulders.  Yeah, I'm looking for, like, a big ape of a man. 
[01:59:00]  Why are you wearing?  I'll see you later, open.  You idiot.  You know, like Robin Williams, Harry.  An Armenian.  Are there any terrorists in town?  An Armenian woman would actually fit the bill, too.  Pull over, taxi guy.  Why don't you get a police dog?  All right.  Jay, thank you.  And Morgan, thank you.  Right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Have fun at the Garden.  I'll see you Thursday.  Looking forward to it.  I don't even know what that means.  All right.  Morgan from IBetcherWill.com.  I don't even know what that means.  They carry it. 
[01:59:30]  I got a sperm count, you guys.  Oh, yeah.  We need to air the...  What happened?  Hey.  What happened?  Ben just came out of the closet.  Hey, looking sharp.  Hey, what the hell are you dressed in?  Hey, Tony, you dancing tonight?  There are my little things called the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  He can't dress up.  And there are my pre-sundry aliens tonight.  Oh, wow.  Gee, Uncle Charlie.  Gee, Uncle Charlie.  I tried to talk him, but...  It's Ernie from my pre-sundry.  Oh, my God.  One of my better impressions. 
[02:00:00]  Everyone wants walking.  Screw walking.  I'm moving on.  All right.  Let's hear it again.  Let's hear it again.  Gee, Uncle Charlie.  What am I supposed to do?  I'm going to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Uncle Charlie.  Ben.  Ben, where are you going, man?  I'm going to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  He's got a sports jacket on.  He's going to be there, Pop.  Isn't that in another state?  Jesus Christ, Steve.  Ernie wants to go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  He's got the Wal-Mart.  Uncle Charlie says, oh, God, Steve, the kid must go listen to Rock and Roll. 
[02:00:30]  Let him go.  Remember when we used to smoke pot, listen to Rock and Roll?  Jesus Christ, you never told me about you smoking pot.  I knocked off hordes three at a time.  They're doing some kind of thing?  What are they doing?  Waldorf, Errol Smith's getting inducted by Kid Rock.  Is Joan Rivers still the lead singer of Errol Smith?  That was like a buffoon.  We were talking about that earlier.  He's got to get rid of the scarves.  The scarves and like the eight inches of muscle he had removed from his face. 
[02:01:00]  Jeez.  That guy's ears are touching in the back.  What, is he here?  You guys are looking around and he's about to get whacked.  You never know who listens.  But that's fine because it's all in fun, right, Jay?  That's all you've got to say.  No, I really mean...  Thank you for bailing me out.  See, Uncle Charlie? 
[02:01:30]  Me and my friend, Tommy, are going to go fire up the church.  What are you doing, Uncle Charlie?  Make sure you're back early.  You've got to mow the lawn tomorrow.  Uncle Charlie.  Once I get this crystal meth in my system, I'll mow the whole lawn.  What do you think I'm putting in the stew tonight?  He's always cooking.  That's why I love you, Uncle Charlie.  Vaseline.  No, I don't need it, Uncle Charlie.  I'm losing.  Here's one of my sweatpants.  They stand up.  I do I, Uncle Charlie. 
[02:02:00]  I'm putting it in the sauce.  I'm going to eat over at Townshend, Uncle Charlie.  I'm a kid toucher.  Uncle Charlie, I always thought it was my fault.  It is.  You're dirty and you were asking for it.  F me, Uncle Charlie.  Uncle Charlie, make my glasses crooked.  So you're going to be able to meet anybody down there?  Make some connections?  I'll snaggle my way. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, Fred McMurray.  Fred McMurray.  Yeah, Fred McMurray you're going to meet down there.  Stick it in, Uncle Charlie.  I will meet everyone and get IDs and all that crap.  Yeah, Ben.  Ben's going to be rocking.  Networking.  If you don't, it's your ass.  Very cool.  Like a made man.  The drunk program director.  If you don't get that, it's your ass.  You hear me?  It's your ass.  Bye, Ben.  Bye-bye, La Machine. 
[02:03:00]  All right there.  La Machine.  He's on Stacker, too.  Look at all the weight he was.  I know.  Look at him.  80 big ones using the Stacker, too.  80 big ones.  All right.  They're still charging for it.  You think they've got to get some free stuff?  Hell no.  I mean, come on.  Not from us.  Rockaway.  Ah, look at him.  He didn't leave.  But when I said free, get out of here, you liar.  Free stuff, please.  Get out.  Get out.  Yes.  All right.  Hey, what happened to that girl, the teenager that entered the ass contest?  Ladies, you still could come down this week to qualify. 
[02:03:30]  I don't think they're going to qualify after this ass.  Really?  Pretty intense.  Amazing.  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  Catholic school girlish.  Yeah, what do you got there?  Look at that.  It's a little plaid skirt.  Yeah.  You got a black little blouse top on there.  Thigh high.  Black.  Thigh high.  Pleated.  And a black button-down shirt.  Pigtails.  And pigtails.  Very nice.  My wife, Nicole, by the way, we should mention, is here, and she's a big fan of the Catholic  school. 
[02:04:00]  She was spanking you outside the studio.  Well, she's a very bad little girl.  That lawn is a very naughty, naughty, naughty girl.  She needed a spanking.  All right.  You ready for this?  Yeah.  How old are you?  18.  18.  You can't say suck that C.  So now I don't even know if they heard the answer.  How old are you?  18.  18 years old.  When's your birthday?  November.  All right.  She just turned 18.  Okay.  We like when you get girls just into the 18th. 
[02:04:30]  When did you turn 18?  November.  Wow.  So you're right, honey.  Do you ever think about parlaying your ass modeling career into like maybe some like  hustler magazines or amateur porno or professional porno?  No.  No?  Just for the Opie and Anthony listeners?  How about a little spanking on the air?  Nicole?  If Nicole wants to.  Well, I didn't like that tone, little missy.  Would you like me to spank you?  Whoa. 
[02:05:00]  You little bitch.  You better ask me to say I've been very naughty.  I've been very naughty, Nicole.  You got to mean it.  That didn't sound like you.  I wouldn't hire you for my plan.  Look at this.  Uh-oh.  I've been very naughty, Nicole.  Stop saying my wife's name.  My parents are listening.  What are they listening to this joke for?  That's a long drive.  You've been very naughty.  Please discipline me, baby.  Baby?  Oh, my God.  That's disrespectful. 
[02:05:30]  But who cares, really?  I don't like that.  Don't call me baby.  What have you been doing?  You've been very naughty?  I've been very naughty.  All right.  She's bending her over the console and now lifting up her little Catholic skull thing.  There's her bare ass.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  Oh, God.  I don't think that was enough, little missy.  Wow.  She's like.  Her little round rump is turning red.  She's just a little girl.  She's just a little girl.  She's just a young teen girl.  What are you doing?  She's just a little girl. 
[02:06:00]  Why are you rubbing her ass and spanking the little 18-year-old girl's ass?  Part of me feels very, very guilty for spanking this sweet little round ass.  Oh, my God.  She slammed.  Look at that.  That would hurt.  That would hurt.  All right.  Wow.  All right.  Look at that.  That's great.  I just shot mule juice in my wooden underpants.  Hi, Iva Jean and John.  Oh, man.  Hey, let's go shout out to the folks. 
[02:06:30]  Let's go shout out.  You know what the best part of that was?  Little blonde hair.  Oh, no.  Look at that.  It's all red.  That's right.  Oh, my God.  You made her ass red.  You better go soak that in something like my face.  No, thank you.  I'd rather pass.  That's on you.  Wow.  That's on you.  Hey, I got the thoroughbred, honey.  Sheesh.  That's pretty good.  I got the thoroughbred. 
[02:07:00]  She asked me if I was Opie when she came in.  Do you know Jay Moore?  Jay Moore?  That's Jay Moore.  Yeah, she thought I was Opie when she came in.  Don't you know Jay Moore from my TV movies?  Can I get a photo, Opie?  Did you see Pay It Forward?  I saw the movie Go, just like about...  All right.  There's Jay Moore from Go.  And I didn't know.  He was the gay guy.  Right.  Now I know.  He's a faggy.  She's a club kid.  Are you a club kid?  Yeah, she does extra say in like...  No, I don't.  Look, your hands are pink. 
[02:07:30]  You've got no circulation.  You're smoking all your crystal meth.  Look at her hands.  I don't even know what crystal meth is.  You look like you just have four boxes of Newports.  Four boxes of Newports.  You guys should see the shoes she's wearing.  Let me see the shoes.  I saw the Spice Girls wear those ones.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's a club shoe.  Yeah.  Right?  It's a club shoe.  She's got ecstasy under the heels.  We're not...  This is just an impression we're doing.  No, don't take that seriously. 
[02:08:00]  Don't take that seriously.  Svetlana.  We're imitating a guy that would say that.  Right.  Did we get good pictures of her?  Oh.  Yeah.  I had them do the profile one, which I think is the best.  Yeah, which one of you, Mary Kate or Ashley?  Are you complaining about the red mark on your butts?  No, ma'am.  I'm not...  No, ma'am.  No, I'm trying to burn now.  Maybe you should switch jeans.  Hmm.  Better watch your peas and cues, little missus. 
[02:08:30]  Screw spanking her ass.  Punch her in the pleasure pouch.  Don't mind the puppet.  Joe Camel would have drank from that.  Looks like the Del Castro eating a London broil.  I thought of the black cat with his throat slit.  So this is just for the O.P. and Anthony listeners.  You realize there's like four million people you're talking to now. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  You're big time, honey.  Yeah.  Microphone.  You're going to have to be wearing a lot of tight pants.  She's beautiful.  Recently?  Yeah, you are beautiful.  You're going to be a finalist in the ass contest.  Who's going to beat that?  I don't know.  I really don't know.  Who's going to come in here with a pink handprint on their ass?  Yeah, you've got to get a picture of the...  Oh, the handprint.  The handprint.  Looks like someone dropped a port cap on the barbershop floor.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  That is?  That milky white...  Oh, my God, Anthony. 
[02:09:30]  All right, all right.  Someone wants to say hi to Jay Moore.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  How you doing?  Good.  Oh, son of a bitch.  What?  It's Lady Di.  What?  You don't know Lady Di, right, Jay?  We got new freaks since you've been here.  This is a stalker.  Go ahead.  Explain what you think about me.  She is one half of the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Right.  We call them, her and Mary, and it's the other one.  We have 18-year-old ass in. 
[02:10:00]  Right.  Exactly.  How are you doing, Jay Moore?  Hey, this is good.  How are you?  This is what we do, though.  It's very nice meeting you.  Then we'll go back to meeting him.  You're on the phone.  I know that.  No, explain Lady Di to Jay, so you can fully appreciate the Lady Di.  Why would he care?  Smells like hot gobby.  What old ass?  Hey.  What?  What's that?  Anthony, watch it.  What did I say?  Hey, time is precious here, honey.  We got 18-year-old answers for you.  Yeah, this is what your ass should look like.  We have Svetlana here.  My ass is nice.  I really think my ass looks really nice.  She came in here in leather pants. 
[02:10:30]  Okay, can I just say one thing?  If I went over there and, you know, maybe I took my leather pants down,  maybe you would think my ass is nice.  No, I don't think we need to...  You're scaring Svetlana.  You wouldn't have to unwrap an elephant to know it's an elephant.  Anthony, watch it.  What's the matter?  Watch it.  Be nice, Anthony.  I'm being nice.  The puppet's being mean. 
[02:11:00]  Hot garbage.  I'm going to tell Marion on you.  Whatever.  Your ass looks like you've got a midget in your pants fighting his way out.  No, I...  Hey.  Watch it.  Okay?  Lady Di.  Wow.  Who's that?  That's the...  Her pictures are up on WNEW.com.  No, we're not.  We never went over there.  Shut up, Lady Di.  Like we're talking about you.  Like we would be excited talking about your ass.  Okay?  Wow.  How insane are you?  You're like some kind of a mad woman.  How insane am I?  You're like a mad woman. 
[02:11:30]  She thought we were talking about her ass.  Oh, wow.  Lady Di's ass is up.  Let's all take a look.  I'm going to bang you so hard that she's going to fill up the line.  Maybe my ass should be up there, too.  What do you think?  All right, look.  Jay.  She's a hooah.  Jay.  Yeah.  How are you doing, Jay?  I'm doing great.  How are you doing?  Okay, I met Jim Norton.  She's a hooah.  She's a really nice guy, you know.  Why would Jay care that you met Jim Norton?  Ah, pussah.  I'm just saying that.  I don't know.  Ah, pussah.  Hang yourself from the ramps, you dumb cluck.  I knew I was going to get this kind of abuse. 
[02:12:00]  What do you expect?  Yes.  There you go.  Very nice pictures.  Look, did you see the pictures?  These pictures are great.  The 18-year-old's...  Do you want me to go over there and enter the best-ass contest?  Oh, okay.  Would you like me to go over there and enter the contest?  Because I will, you know.  Okay.  Yeah, sure.  All right, Lady Di.  Okay.  Come over here with your big, saggy, fat ass.  No, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on one second.  Compete with something that looks like it was drawn with a compass.  It's not big, saggy, and fat.  That thing is, like, round. 
[02:12:30]  That is a ball hip socket.  We're looking at 18-year-old's ass right now on WNAW.com.  Hey, so that Lana just told me she doesn't like her ass.  March 19th.  March 19th.  What?  Contessa number 15, Lana.  Hey, she doesn't.  Well, we're coming up there on the 29th.  Is that okay?  No, that's not okay.  Why?  Hit the switch.  Who is saying that?  Lady Di, we got to go.  If you want in on the ass contest, you've got to get in here this week.  Take a dump and a piss fire.  I certainly will.  All right. 
[02:13:00]  We can't wait to see that grotesque ass.  It's not grotesque.  You go into the forest and trees pay on you.  Oh, come on.  It is not that bad.  Okay?  How about this Friday?  You keep it under a porch.  Friday?  Is that okay?  You keep your ass under a porch.  No.  Who doesn't fire anybody?  Who said that?  Ah, pussy.  Ah, pussy.  The puppet. 
[02:13:30]  The puppet's very angry.  Come on, guys.  Come on, guys.  Why don't you wait for the best bunt contest?  You win that handstand.  Big bunt.  Kill yourself.  Get in the coffin.  You know what?  I'll go park a bike in a track.  As a group, I will enter that contest.  If I win.  Tim.  If I win the contest.  Tim.  Oh, my God.  Lady Di, I'm 17.  If you put your ass on the web, I swear to God, I'm going to have to kill myself.  Kill yourself.  Oh, my God.  My name is Tim.  I'm a listener.  I'm 17.  Her hemorrhoids look like tea bags.  Oh, my God. 
[02:14:00]  You're Opie.  Yes, sir.  Mozzarella cheese.  Can I say a message to the ONA fans from the XFL?  Yeah, go.  We're having a huge tailgate party, gate B, section 8B, if they all want to come down  and hang out.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Lady Di, ask.  Lady Di.  Yes.  When are you going to get the hint that we don't like you?  Love.  I'm walking it back.  Who is this?  Opie?  Svetlana.  Anthony.  Be a part of the show. 
[02:14:30]  Anthony.  I don't know.  What?  Anthony.  We'll get to her in a second.  How are you tonight?  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Anthony.  Hold on.  Lady Di.  Yes.  And this message is for Stalker Patty and Marion and the...  She's more annoying than this big brother.  Well, Marion right now is on her way to a Rangers game.  She's probably listening to you right now.  And the rest of the Stalkers...  What position is she playing, troll?  What is it...  What is it...  Watch it.  Lady Di, what is it going to take for you to believe that we don't like you?  Looks like she's got the pork chop on the garbage chop floor.  We like you. 
[02:15:00]  That's the whole thing.  All right.  But, see, Stalker Patty...  She's got a stinky oog, daddy.  I don't care what kind of recordings you play.  We like you guys.  Okay?  My son listens to you guys.  But, Lady Di...  Yes?  Because it doesn't get through to Patty either.  We don't like you.  I don't care.  We like you.  And then Stalker Patty goes, oh, I know.  You're just kidding.  What is it going to take for you to believe us?  We like you guys.  That's all it takes, Sophie. 
[02:15:30]  They like us.  It doesn't matter how we feel.  Let me tell you something right now.  Vince McMahon.  Okay?  What did he do to you guys?  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  I'm so skeeved.  Every time she's on the phone, I feel like I've got to curl up in the shower stall.  Hi, Lana.  Hi, Lana.  See, now, this is something we like.  Hi.  Look at how cute she is here.  Isn't that better?  A nice, pretty young girl here.  18.  Her ass is up on WNAW.com.  And you don't like the pictures? 
[02:16:00]  No, I like the pictures.  I don't know.  They're beautiful.  Thank you.  Look at that.  What don't you like about your ass?  Oh, her son's sad.  You look like a little more lifted, do you?  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  She's 18 and it's starting to sag.  I had a really good ass at 12.  And then, um...  I wish I had this contest when I was 13.  Are you kidding?  Look at that.  You think your ass is starting to sag?  I don't know.  The listeners will decide.  I think it's beautiful.  Yeah, the listeners know all.  It must be nice because the whole network is slowing down because people are trying to 
[02:16:30]  check out your ass.  I'm serious.  Yeah, look, they're all looking.  All right, we got to take a break there.  Yes.  Jay's got a sperm count story.  Yeah, we got a sperm count.  Uh-oh.  Yep.  Jay told me part of the story.  It's pretty funny.  Just to know what we were dealing with.  All right, we'll get into that next, okay?  Interesting.  It's another Opie and Anthony Rose show.  It's Thursday night at the Vanderbilt in Plainview, Long Island.  Doors open at 6.  O&A will be there after the show. 
[02:17:00]  I'm 21 and older only.  Get directions and other info on WNEW.com.  1027.  WNEW.  Anthony, PowerTel in Abacor.  Yeah, if you think you're losing your hair or it's thinning, go to Dr. Gordon.  He's the medical director of the Harrington Treatment Center.  Oh, God, stupid.  Anthony, I hear an annoying voice in the background.  Hello?  Who?  Hello?  Hello?  Not again.  Not again.  Me again?  Yeah.  Hi.  Show yourself. 
[02:17:30]  How are you guys?  And she can't hear us right now?  Yeah.  I think she's at her breaking point.  I think we're getting close.  We're going to get one of these stalkers to kill themselves.  Hello?  Oh, hi.  Hi.  What's up?  How's everything?  Good.  You fat whore.  Who's calling me a fat?  Who's calling me that in the background?  I'm a puppet.  I don't know.  It's a puppet.  It's a puppet.  It's a puppet.  It's a puppet.  Let me talk to her for a minute, please.  Obviously, someone that has seen you.  Let me talk to her for a minute.  It's a guy.  It's a guy.  Okay.  Who's calling me a fat whore? 
[02:18:00]  What makes people lose their hair?  It's a bad body chemical called dihydrotestosterone.  She's got plenty of it whore.  Anthony, is this you?  No, it's not Anthony, you dumb cluck.  He's sitting across the room.  I think it's Anthony.  Anthony, say something at the same time.  We'll all talk.  We'll all talk at the same time.  Man, man, can you drink abacor and choke on your own hair?  No, I can.  Drink abacor.  Drink abacor.  Grow hair on your throat.  I saw your ass doing windshields with a squeegee. 
[02:18:30]  Would you like me to drink a gallon of milk?  Lady Di, why did your husband leave you?  No, why did I leave my husband?  Because he's a genius.  Excuse me.  Why did I leave my husband?  If you had to bang that fat ass, you'd leave her too.  Look, guys, guys, that's a strange subject.  Come on, guys.  Why not he wouldn't bang this broad?  That is not a funny subject.  That's funny.  Why did you leave your husband?  No, no, no.  I left my husband because he was not exactly the opposite to me. 
[02:19:00]  He was what?  He was not exactly being husband to me.  What does that mean?  He was banging someone else?  I have no idea.  Who cares?  Who knows?  Who cares?  He had a drink.  Deal with you.  What?  He had to have a cocktail to see your friend.  Who was in the studio?  Otto and George or what?  Thanks for catching on, sir.  By the way, this is Laverne.  The retarded Laverne.  The retarded Laverne. 
[02:19:30]  You retarded something.  Lady Di, bye.  Thank you very much.  Bye.  This isn't true, is it?  Hello?  Hello.  Is this Vince McMahon?  Is this Opie and Anthony?  Yes.  How are you guys doing?  Vince McMahon.  We're having some problems.  I didn't stand up.  And you know what?  These problems are parents to you guys.  You can guarantee.  Wait, wait.  Wait.  Hold on.  There is no doubt about it.  Wait, wait.  Wait, no one heard any of that because we had a tough bout. 
[02:20:00]  And that was great.  All right.  Well, it's true.  Can you say the word?  Can you say the, just say the F instead of the word?  Your office F's things up.  I don't say F.  Yeah, he said the word.  He just didn't.  But that was too good.  That was great.  This is an HBO with Bob Costas.  I can't believe Vince McMahon's in my headphones.  Yeah, of course Vince is on.  Now, Vince, we were talking, we were supposed to come in, I think, this week.  I just heard about it a moment ago.  It's news to me. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, we would have liked to have had you come in live.  Right.  So then we put a moratorium on all things WWF related because it's the only way to get through to some of your people.  They don't understand.  We're trying to play hardball here now.  Yeah, I understand that.  You know, you understand hardball.  You know who we learned that from?  Who's that?  You.  Vince McMahon.  Man, we're playing your gig.  All right, good.  Now, Vince, we saw the Bob Costas thing.  Yeah.  And we thought it was very funny.  I mean, at one point it looked like Bob was peeing himself because he leaned over and got in his face with your finger and said, 
[02:21:00]  Shut up and let me finish.  And that was kind of good.  Did he look like really intimidated by what you were doing?  Actually, you know, Bob's pretty cool, I guess, is all right.  It's just that, you know, when you're going to talk with someone and converse, you know, you're trying to have a conversation, you don't want to constantly be interrupted.  And that was the thing that I'd made up my mind going on in the air that I was going to be my usual calm, cool, and collected self.  Yeah.  And, you know, and it's like then when I got there and he just kept interrupting me, then, you know, damn old, you know, my real self had to come out a little bit, I guess. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  Well, he didn't do his research.  I was screwing it at the TV when he started bringing up the socket and the cross grabbing.  I'm like, God, Bob, you haven't even done any of the basic research.  WWF hasn't done that in a year, year and a half.  No, I know.  And he's just a little behind the times, although the last time he was in a World Wrestling Federation ring in 1985. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, he was a guest ring announcer.  No kidding.  Jimmy Lennon, Jr.  It's been a while.  Wow.  And then things have changed.  He's become an elitist.  And, you know, instead of the real fun-loving type guy he used to be, when we did, even prior to that, we did the first anniversary Letterman show.  Both he and I did that.  And it was a lot of fun.  I mean, he used to have a lot of fun in doing what he does.  And since then, now he's become a bit of an elitist and above everyone else. 
[02:22:30]  And, you know, he really panders to all of the critics.  And that's his audience as opposed to real Americans.  Yeah, he was coming across with this holier-than-thou attitude and, you know, what's going on in the wrestling and XFL is too explicit for blah, blah, blah.  And I'm sitting there going, well, who is this guy now, a moral leader, Bob Costas?  Yeah, it was kind of sickening to watch.  But then there was something else that was brought up.  The fantastic XFL game day pregame show, Vince McMahon, that we were hosting for The Blink of an Eye. 
[02:23:00]  And you not only said you weren't involved in it, which I can accept because it wasn't a Vince McMahon XFL thing.  It was an NBC program.  But when you said you had no clue that it even existed, Vince, I was almost heartbroken.  You hurt our feelings.  Hang on a second.  We almost cried.  But he was talking about a pregame show.  Right. 
[02:23:30]  And we had no pregame show.  We never had a pregame show.  Wasn't that what we were doing?  I thought it was a pregame show.  No wonder it was.  I mean, it was, but it wasn't, you know.  And it was recorded on a Wednesday, which was cool, but it's not a traditional studio-style football pregame show.  You're using the Bill Clinton BJ defense.  Yeah, I am.  It isn't quite what it was.  I think what he's trying to say is if we were able to do it live, it would have been much better.  You guys live would have been awesome. 
[02:24:00]  See?  Yeah.  You guys live would have been the thing.  Now I can sleep again.  Hey, Vince, we've tried to have Phil Muschnick on our show a bunch of times because not only does he trash you whenever he gets a chance, he trashes us.  Right.  But the pussy won't come on our show ever, ever, ever.  He won't do anything.  He kind of hides behind his newspaper stuff.  No question.  We would love to get you two on the radio at the same time.  I would like to be anywhere he is at the same time.  I've never met him, actually, and I've issued an invitation for him to come visit with me at the corporate headquarters and all of that. 
[02:24:30]  Turned me down.  And never even met me yet has lots of things.  Did he ever meet you guys?  No.  No, hell no.  But he takes his shots at us as well.  Right.  And this is the same guy that writes for the Post where, you know, there's like strip clubs being advertised right on the same page in his column.  Do you think he has a percentage of any of that?  Yeah, right.  He'd be rich if he did.  Look at Vince.  Always thinking.  Hey, Jay Moore's in the studio.  The famous Jay Moore.  Hello, Jay Moore, actor. 
[02:25:00]  Hello, Jay.  Hello, Vince.  There you go.  You know, Vince, I wanted to ask you this.  It's really impressive.  I think we saw with the XFL one of the most significant achievements in television.  You actually got the X logo over the NBC Peacock.  That's one of the most astounding things I've ever seen in my life.  Can you imagine if I had like my own sitcom idea and went to NBC and said, oh, and by the way, I want a big J over the Peacock.  The entire show.  They'd say, there's the door.  Well, they want to be.  Vince did it, man.  Yeah. 
[02:25:30]  I was like, hey, Vince, what's going to happen?  Very impressive, Vince.  What's going to happen with the XFL?  Nice talking to you.  I'm not really sure, other than I'm committed to it from a long-term standpoint.  We'll find out whether or not NBC is.  They say they are.  We certainly hope they are.  Yeah, they were committed to us, too, Vince.  So, again, I read a little something in the New York Times today with Jeff Zucker talking about programming on the weekends.  He kind of beat around the bush a little bit, which is probably the best he could probably do right about now.  Yeah, like I heard some people talking at NBC, like, all right, they're committed through this year, and then they'll have to see what happens. 
[02:26:00]  What are the options?  Because I guess the viewership is a little better on some of the other networks that the games are airing on.  Yeah, well, you know, again, I understand NBC's point of view.  You know, it has not performed up to expectations, and I totally understand that.  At the same time, when you're building a brand from scratch, it takes a while to do that.  Right.  You know, and it's not just television programming.  You know, it's brand building.  And a lot of times that works full of plugs on things before they really get going. 
[02:26:30]  You know, but they're giving this a pretty good shot, and we'll see if it lasts on NBC.  If it doesn't last on NBC, I'm certain it'll last on some other networks.  Hey, wouldn't it help to put the games on earlier?  Because it seems the audience you're going for is out and about, partying, hanging out in bars and stuff.  That's true.  Saturday night is pretty much of a wasteland, you know, in terms of television.  Yeah.  And it's tough, you know, putting anything on, especially to reach the demographic that we normally reach.  So it was difficult.  We knew it was difficult going into it. 
[02:27:00]  I don't think maybe we didn't know exactly how difficult.  Right.  Hmm.  Hey, you want us to F up anything else for you?  Everything else is cool.  What kind of, you got any retooling?  Because I heard you talking maybe some of the announcers will be changed, or?  Yeah, we're going to make a couple of announcements in several weeks, so the NCAA is over with,  and, you know, crank things up a little bit, see if that helps.  Any ideas as far as just, besides the announcers maybe, some things you got in on the burner?  We've got some ideas as it relates to scoring.  It still has to be football. 
[02:27:30]  We have some ideas as it relates to scoring and things of that nature to ramp things up some.  I couldn't believe Bob asked you if you're thinking of fixing the games.  How the hell do you fix a football game?  Yeah, that was the best when he says, you know, you're thinking of scripting them.  The guy still has to catch the ball.  It's like, how do you script the game?  All right, you run out.  You go 50 yards.  I'm going to throw a Hail Mary to you, and you have to catch it because it's written in the script.  And make it look like it's real.  Sure.  Yeah.  We really enjoyed the Bob Costas interview because you really had him shaking in his boots. 
[02:28:00]  Well, I enjoyed it as well.  As a matter of fact, I asked Costas, I talked to him the next day.  I said, how about let's do this again?  Yeah.  And he said we could, so, you know, we'll see.  You know what I like, Opie?  We started bitching about an hour or so ago.  And within an hour, Vince McMahon on the phone making sure Opie and Anthony are happy.  Absolutely.  I like that.  I like that.  I feel now that we've got some juice.  We've got plenty of juice.  Hey, Vince, someone screwed up in your office.  Could you have them fired for us? 
[02:28:30]  I'm pretty good at that, actually.  Yeah, someone effed up and didn't get the message through to you personally that we wanted to speak to you.  So, could you tell us who you're going to fire over this?  It could be a whole litany of individuals.  Hey, any words for Phil Mushnick because he listens to us?  No, actually, I wouldn't want to waste my time.  All right, Vince, we'll say hi to the family.  Will do.  And keep in touch.  And you know something?  We should have, like, the bat line to get to you instead of having to go through these people. 
[02:29:00]  I'm cool with that.  Don't worry.  I want your home number and your cell number.  Yeah, can we have the cell number, possibly?  Sure, we can do that.  We want to ask your daughter out.  It's easy now.  Is she still single?  You think, yeah, Opie.  Yeah, you got a shot.  Yeah, it's happening.  Wait, she went for the hug the last time I saw her.  That giant stadium.  What is it?  It's an awkward moment, like when you know somebody long enough, Vince, but you're not sure if you give the kiss hello or the handshake.  For you, it's the handshake, obviously.  I don't think I'd go with the kiss for Vince.  But for your daughter, you don't know because we're kind of comfortable around her now. 
[02:29:30]  But we don't know whether to lean over and give the kiss on the cheek or the handshake, the hug.  What do you do?  She's pretty affectionate.  What do you suggest?  I'd go for the kiss on the cheek.  Yeah?  What about the lips?  Hey.  Nice kiss.  At your own risk.  Vince, how about a little grand ass?  Just a little reach around upper, upper, lower back, upper ass region.  Of course you're talking about...  You're really reaching.  But we're talking about Stephanie, the character. 
[02:30:00]  Right.  Of course.  Yeah, not your daughter.  Of course not.  Can we take out the character?  Looks like the character is a goer.  Yeah.  Probably so.  All right, Vince.  Well, thanks for calling up and clearing this up.  I appreciate you guys taking the call.  And this means a lot to us.  And pay-per-view this Sunday.  You got it.  Actually, two weeks.  April 1.  April 1.  Thanks, guys.  WrestleMania.  Bye-bye.  Thanks, Vince.  There you go.  See? 
[02:30:30]  We friggin' blew up and got all pissed off.  It gets right back to Vince.  And he finds time in his busy schedule.  To speak with Opie and Anthony.  How did that happen?  We stood up for ourselves for a while.  Wow.  We came on the air.  You know, this isn't good for this to happen.  Because now we're going to be real pricks.  Just because it worked once.  Ken Stevens?  Suck it!  Where is he?  Where's our GM?  The best was he didn't get to hear anything.  He came on the air cursing. 
[02:31:00]  I know.  Somebody obviously ucked up in my office.  And they're always ucking up in my office.  Hey, Vince, you can't use that.  Someone is ucked.  Alright.  Where were we?  Oh, yeah.  We were in a read.  PowerTel and Abacor.  Yes.  Dr. Gordon, medical director of the Hair and Skin Treatment Center in New York.  You know the best part of that?  Yes.  The best part of that?  Lady Di's going to call back and go,  Why'd you hang up on me?  Yeah.

Thank you, Vince.  You sit here. 
[02:32:30]  Look at him, Dano.  Get the Grecian formula.  I want to thank Vince for calling it.  Yes.  Everyone else gets floppy seconds.  We got some juice.  Some pull.  The 18-year-old is still in high school, she told us.  Oh, yeah?  How's that going for you?  Are you good?  What are you going to get to speak into the microphone?  Wait, you're still in high school.  Speak right into my mic.  I don't like school.  Ah?  You don't like school? 
[02:33:00]  It's not fun.  Yeah.  You can't find any 14-year-olds to bang you?  What do you got, Phil?  I don't want to thank 14-year-olds.  I don't.  Bump it, though.  What do you got until, obviously, you're out this summer?  The last year?  The last year, yeah.  Ah.  Where are you going?  Going to go to college or something?  Yeah.  Going right by the airport with a pole.  Got a special how much you got.  You want to go to the champagne room college?  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  Going to better wait for college while she's in college.  School of life, baby.  Doing well.  You don't want to do any nude modeling or any amateur modeling or...  Hardcore porno?  Yeah, like, I mean, you just came in because you love Opie and Anthony?  She wants to go to Vegas.  It's a Vegas trip.  Vegas?  Where she can see me.  I don't know.  Order a steak.  Medium rate.  Yeah.  If you sleep with Opie, I'll fly you to L.A.  I don't know. 
[02:34:00]  Dude, you heard like boyfriends right there.  No, that's your friend.  That's a...  Believe me, I scoped that whole situation out.  I just got it all figured out.  All right, we got to hear about the sperm count.  I need to hear about the sperm count thing.  Oh, I had two quick questions, though.  I got to ask you.  Yeah.  About Cherry Falls.  Oh, yeah.  Was it you...  Whenever they showed the killer, was it you always in the killer thing?  No.  All right.  Motherfucker.  Because I'm looking.  No, I said mother...  Okay.  Because I'm looking going, I know it's Jack.  So I'm looking at hands. 
[02:34:30]  I'm trying to see...  No, it was a black belt woman.  Was it?  Feedback to go crazy.  It was like the Olympics black belt champion.  She was like six foot.  Really?  Yeah.  Because I'm looking at hands.  And did you do your little stunt where you fell off of the...  No.  ...fell through the railing?  No?  I'm going to...  What a great concept for a movie, though. 
[02:35:00]  The chicks that were getting killed.  You see the hands still in the kid's head where she showed it off?  Yeah.  The hands.  That was like the final laugh of the movie.  But you putting on your makeup.  How about when I made the puppet a couple of dollars?  You made the George reference.  When you were very drunk...  When you were very drunk...  He's working on a little pub.  I've got to see Terry Fox.  You've got to see that.  You saw the whole movie?  Yeah.  I rented it that night.  Oh, yeah.  And it was hard to get.  You mean it was available?  We talk about these goddamn movies and they fly off the shelves. 
[02:35:30]  They become cult classics.  But it was very funny to see you with the makeup on.  And then when you came to the door,  and when the kid knocked at the door,  I'm going to have the daughter and the father tied up in the basement.  And Jay comes to the robot.  Hello.  Yes.  What are you doing here, Timmy?  What are you doing here, Timmy?  He goes, why are you wearing lipstick?  I go, I'm not.  I'm not.  You're just lying, though.  He goes, I saw her bike right there.  I go, that's not her bike.  That's not a bike.  There's no bike there. 
[02:36:00]  He's doing the OJ thing.  It was hysterical.  He goes, why are you wearing lipstick?  I go, it makes me hot.  Rocky.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Yo, it's the O-A-N-J show.  What's happening?  That's right.  That's O-A.  I'm just visiting.  Hey, yo, Jay, man, I really got to ask you,  because I don't know if you remember me calling in a while ago, man.  I really, man, I'm like in love, man, with Brittany Murphy now.  Was she great to work with?  She's a sweetheart.  Yeah.  Yo, dude, can you hook me up?  Absolutely.  I'll give you a whole phone.  I'll stand home.  All right.  You do this thing on the front. 
[02:36:30]  Thank you.  Oh, hold on.  And ladies, man, you're doing a good job, so keep it up.  Who's that?  No, I don't know.  What?  What?  Don't you have, like, the butt cunt contest going on there?  Oh, we had one girl show up today.  A lot of her.  Okay, more invitation.  Yeah, her pictures are up on WNAW.com.  She's 18 years old, and she looks very nice.  Sweet.  All right.  This makes me look pretty.  Is that what you said?  That's what I said when I did my sperm count.  They give you a cup?  Have you guys gotten one?  We've actually, we did something once called the sperm bowl. 
[02:37:00]  Did you do it into the cup?  We had a wager on who had the highest sperm count.  And we had a technician come in and go, thank you.  You did, right?  Why do you say that?  He's a thousand off of them.  Look at this guy.  He's a thousand off.  He's a goat weed, man.  He's sperm all over the place, not.  What was the number?  How much did you have?  I don't even remember.  I don't remember.  We had to do it live on the air.  It's like the population of us.  You've got some funky-tasting funk.  How long did you have to abstain before you did the sperm count? 
[02:37:30]  Well, yeah, I was like 24 hours or so.  Yeah, mine was five days.  Right.  Five days?  Why five days?  Because otherwise you'd mess up the count.  Look at Nicole, she remembers those five days.  Oh, yeah.  Five days in the desert.  Nothing.  Not even a sniff.  I wouldn't even let her walk around the house in a brown pan.  Why, did Nicole have to abstain, too?  Yay!  That's a winner.  You know.  All right, so give us the details.  So you have to...  You've got to wait five days. 
[02:38:00]  And I don't know about you, but I mean, I'm a freak.  You know, five days.  If I, like, broke my back and I was in my throat, you know that full cast you see in, like,  a goofy commercial where the guy had to tell in the case with the ropes and stuff?  Sure.  I'd still rub one out.  You'd still figure it out.  Somehow.  You know, like, maybe where the gauze ran out on the cast, where you get that little  extra layer of gauze?  I'd get the tip of it right against the gauze and just...  I'd pound that gauze, man.  I'd get a roll of gauze and I'd take care of it.  You're scaring me at you.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  She's right here.  She's sitting right on that hot, tight little ass of her. 
[02:38:30]  Smiling.  My sperm count was lousy.  You've got nothing to worry about.  What happened?  You wiped that smile out of me.  So you go down there.  Five days, you've been abstaining.  Yeah, and they give you this cup.  Like, it's like a little cup.  And I'm like...  Wait, walk us through the whole thing.  You get a...  I go in there.  It's 8 o'clock.  Well, Nicole says I got to get...  First of all, my mother brought it up.  And my mother's a nurse.  She's a health professional, so it's not that odd that she'd be on top of it if we're talking  about having kids.  But you don't want sperm to ever come out of your mother's mouth.  Well, you've always been one, my friend. 
[02:39:00]  Don't worry.  Your parents are like, you know, Charlie Brown's teacher when, you know, I'm 30.  My mom's like, wah, wah, wah, and then I'm like, sperm!  Ha, ha, ha!  Yeah, y'all ladies did it!  Now, this isn't something you just go and say, hey, for kicks, let me get a sperm count.  What, are you two trying to tell...  Yeah, we want to have a kid.  Have a kid?  We want to have a kid.  Not any time real soon, but sooner rather than later.  And I just was curious.  Make sure all the equipment's working.  Yeah, it's like, you know, do I have to get off the birth control?  All those questions.  Well, I would think, not a professional, but I would say yes. 
[02:39:30]  Kind of throw in something there.  But I didn't want to get pregnant right away, so I was thinking, okay, let's find out, you know, what...  Five days, Martin.  Wanted to know what we're dealing with.  All right, so the five days you go in...  Tony and Miss Monacotta!  Those five portrait long days.  But I want to know, like, to give you...  With a cup, it's like five days, I got a Gatorade bottle in my car.  Five days.  I could take...  How big is the cup?  Like, those two little...  It's like a nightclub cup.  The plastic shot things they have in the bar? 
[02:40:00]  It's like a Tupperware.  And then I go in there, and of course, every nurse in this place is, like, hot.  Porno hot.  The ballet.  Yeah, you'd think they'd go to a German...  Struggling actresses.  Right, but you'd think they'd go to a German house frowns.  Like, are you finished?  And now she's like, and here we have magazines for your easement.  They cast me out.  Easement?  Yeah, I'm like, I'm about to give my son to somebody who uses the word easement.  What?  Easement?  I'm like, if you really want to, you know, ease me, hang out, you know?  Watch.  Get involved.  Right. 
[02:40:30]  So what kind of magazine?  Everything good?  No, but I brought two of my own.  I stopped at the newsstand.  They must do a great business over there, the newsstand by the...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's what she says.  Right before she walks out the door, she goes, okay, and when you're done,  you bring it to the counter, and don't forget to lock the door.  Okay, check.  Thanks for the tip.  Thanks for the tip.  So you're in this little room?  The doctor's office at 8 o'clock in the morning.  Yeah, that's on my way.  I was just going to leave the door cracked.  If anybody needs some help.  Leave it open a little bit.  I don't need four or five cups, so I need someone to keep running them in. 
[02:41:00]  I don't want to have to keep getting up.  All right.  So I'm done, and then I bring it to the thing.  What's in this small room, though?  It's a doctor's office.  Oh, just like a standard doctor's office table with a paper on it thing?  Yeah, and they had magazines, and they had, like, JCPenney catalog, and like...  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  The catalog?  No, they had some free underwear.  I was going to say, for everybody, if you're offended by it.  They had freaky ones, too, but I wasn't going to tell you.  All right.  I don't know who the underwear is hot. 
[02:41:30]  I don't know who...  Spaz could have been in there before me.  Yeah, you don't know who the hell's going to be in there.  Well, uh...  No, I'm not sure.  They're really standing around.  They're, you know...  They're products.  Right.  They're products for the cup.  And, uh...  In a cup, it's like a cocktail party, you know?  Because I've seen it, but I've never held it.  Put in a brandy snifter.  Hey, what are you working on?  Hey, how are you?  We all get those gowns with our asses hanging up the back, holding...  It's like new from Campbell's, a cup of, you know? 
[02:42:00]  The handbag.  That's mine.  So I bring it up, and the lady goes, thank you, Mr. Moore.  And I don't want anybody to, like, to see it.  Not that I'm, like...  I don't...  Not even, like, a famous thing.  You know what I'm saying?  Hey, enough.  Right.  You're famous enough.  Jesus.  I don't want anybody to be like, hey, that's that guy from that thing.  He just pranks one out into a cup into a Gatorade bottle.  Wow.  Look at all that.  Look at what he brought in.  He must have been up all night.  She says, uh, Mr. Moore... 
[02:42:30]  I'm like, easy, lady.  You know?  She goes, was it a...  I swear to...  No, no, this is made up.  Was it a completed ejaculate?  Completed.  And I go, what?  What does it mean complete?  Oh, so...  I said, I don't know what that means.  And she goes, did it all get in the cup?  Like, I'm an idiot.  Ah.  I'm like, yeah, the guy's missed?  Like, you got to ask me that?  Like, some guy...  Set it up on the radiator.  Tilt it.  I'm going to use the wall.  Check it through a ceiling fan, off the blind, nothing but cup.  Set it up, Mark.  Is this the Mark?  Is this the Mark from last time? 
[02:43:00]  I can beat that.  No, the mask, Rick!  Fire!  Breaking up solidarity, Rowley.  Rick.  Rick wants to know if you sneezed in the cup to, like, you know, tap it off.  What bar do you go to, Rick?  Did you sneeze in it for me?  All right.  So then what happened?  Then I got my sperm count back.  And what was it?  It wasn't good, Mark.  What do you got? 
[02:43:30]  My average sperm is 20 million per cc.  Hey, that sounds good.  20 million in average.  Low average, actually, they said.  All right, take it easy, honey, all right?  All right, so 20 million is low average.  Less than a million.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, God, no, please.  Don't torture me.  So what does that mean?  I don't know, bro.  Virgin.  Yeah, right.  All I need is one of those.  Looks like you can get off the, uh, virgin, Julie.  No!  No, it doesn't matter how many you have.  Because all you need is that one son of a bitch swimming his ass off.  Just need one.  An army of one.  I am an army of one.  Could we please lose my laugh?  It's annoying.  I am so sorry, you people. 
[02:44:30]  I am sorry, ONA listeners.  I am sorry.  I mean, listen to that swimming around.  What if he's in a test tube in Northridge with some Korean huddled over a microscope?  Oh, look at this one.  He is huge.  Look at the size of this guy.  He beat up all the other sperm.  Here's my number 54, stupid.  Hey, we have the cleaning guy that went into that office after you did your son.  Oh, we do?  Yeah.  Hey, there's something you don't see in a toilet every day.  I guarantee you. 
[02:45:00]  Then you'll knock up your wife?  It means that we get to have a lot of...  Well, what does it, what does the doctor say, though?  I mean, is it still possible with less than a mil?  Because my banana was in her mouth.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Which way are you taking it?  She said you need help.  Got milk?  Apparently not.  That's a huge sample.  Where did you get that from?  I got it from a negro.  So, no, I'm curious.  What does the doctor say? 
[02:45:30]  Is there still a chance?  He told us to bring on pictures of Svetlana.  Oh!  Oh!  Let me take...  That's a winner!  Hey, Lana.  That'll bring it up about, you know, 10 million.  If you come over, I'll make you ice cream.  You little girl.  Yeah, but the count in the ice cream is pretty low.  You son of a bitch.  What?  I don't know.  It's fine.  There's nothing else you can do.  It's fat free.  Yeah, skim milk, baby. 
[02:46:00]  Skim milk.  He didn't say why or what you could do to boost it up, maybe.  You could still get pregnant.  Yeah.  Right.  But there's...  We could shoot her up with a turkey baster, you know?  Yeah.  Or you could do it in vitro.  What's it called?  That's what my friend did.  But when there's more troops, you have a better chance of winning the battle.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  I want that one maniac.  You have the elite forces.  You want that kamikaze sperm.  Yeah.  Oh, no!  Ties the band around his little sperm head.  I'm going in. 
[02:46:30]  I'm taking out the bridge.  With his Harry Carrey sword.  So I'm not worried about you having a kid.  I'll adopt a black lefty if I have to.  If you're going to adopt, make sure he's a lefty.  If anybody out there thinking about adopting, get the lefty.  Or a Korean.  They're real good, though.  Get the Koreans and the lefties.  They're real good.  That's the only reason they even made a big deal about Elion Gonzalez, because he's a lefty.  That's funny.  If that kid was a righty, he would have been right back on the boat back to Cuba. 
[02:47:00]  But he had that splitter.  That left-handed 11-year-old splitter where you're like, that's not what a left-handed...  That's what a...  11-year-old shouldn't throw like that.  Let's keep him around.  Pass him around the country for the scouts.  So he can see it.  How's that for a chopper?  What the hell was that?  You can't beat Charles Nelson Reilly.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  That was funny.  You guys...  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  One of your samples took up in here last.  We've upped the ante since you've been around.  Nicole, do you feel fear that we might not be able to have children? 
[02:47:30]  No, no.  I just believe that we're going to have to do it a lot more often.  Ah, see?  See, there were some survivors, you know...  Survivors.  Titanic survivors.  I love the survivors.  When I sink my Titanic into that iceberg.  Get out of the way.  The half and half is coming.  You just need one to hang on to that door.  That's it.  You just need one, man.  Hey, we'll let you know if it happens the all-natural way. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, yeah.  If it happens the all-natural way, then it means, you know...  Well, what, if I have to do in vitro, like I'm a fag?  A freak.  Suck it.  Faggy.  What?  Suck it.  You can't get pregnant that way, Opie.  Suck it.  Faggy.  Suck it.  You can't get pregnant that way.  What?  Suck it.  You can't get pregnant that way.  Jane, you need to do in vitro.  That's what I did with my young boys.  It's not unlike raising a Cornish game hen from scratch. 
[02:48:30]  It's crazy.  So you might have to go that route?  I'm not going to try that way.  Right.  Did they tell you anything about positions or anything?  How do they tell you to produce it to having fewer troops than...  How do they tell you you have less than a mil when you're supposed to have about 20 mil or more?  Well, you know, the lady...  They think you're retarded.  The person who told me told me over the phone...  Is it like checking your SAT score?  But the lady who told me told me not to tell my husband the exact number. 
[02:49:00]  When she said, it's less than a million, but I wouldn't tell your husband that.  Oh, then it could be fine.  How less than a mil?  I'm still ahead of the curve, Anthony.  I only need one.  I know.  I understand.  He's worried about his ego.  Were they at least swimming?  Yeah.  They're swimming like tons of bitches, man.  They've got a lot of room.  They've got plenty of room.  Doing the butterfly, the backstroke.  They've got plenty of room to spread out.  You know what it is?  It's an adult swim.  If you ain't in it to win it, get out of the pool.  Because I'm making lefties. 
[02:49:30]  You're not going to have that one just going in circles.  No, get out.  I told you, get off the rope.  The retarded one doing the circles.  I told you, get off the rope.  Now get out of the pool.  You're always hanging on the ropes.  Where's the egg, sir?  I'm swimming in circles, sir.  Got swimmies on it.  Swimmy tried to swim toward the egg.  You're going to name him Swimmy.  I'm going to stay in the shallow end by the skimmer.  Excuse me, sir.  Have you seen a vagina?  I seem to be in a bed.  I must be lost.  My doggy paddle.  Buddy Hackett's one of your sperms inside you. 
[02:50:00]  Well, I know that somewhere up here is a tube.  And I just hope.  Oh, you're a fair son of a bitch, aren't you?  Look at the size of that one.  Is that the egg?  Oh, okay.  You first.  After you, right?  Well, you might as well.  We've got to get out of here.  No, because I'm saying. 
[02:50:30]  It could happen.  With a million or under a million, the odds are different than.  Let's say it goes up a little bit.  Yeah.  Let's think positive.  Let's say I have a.  All right.  No, screw that.  Let's say I have 100,000 sperms.  Wow.  Yeah.  Per blast.  That's called sterile, I think.  No.  Because you have 100,000 sperms.  Okay.  That you have to get to one egg.  Yeah.  It could happen.  And with my junk, they ain't swimming far.  You could drop them right off at the front door.  That's what I'm doing, Hope. 
[02:51:00]  That's what I'm trying to explain to you guys.  It could happen.  It only takes a lie.  Yeah.  It only takes a kawaii.  Whoa.  I'm dropping them right in the mail slot.  Hey, the Islanders could win the Stanley Cup, too.  No, don't get crazy.  They're talking about me having a kid, and you're being crazy.  Handcuff yourself to the chair.  It's a stupid thing to do.  Remember that in King of New York?  You know, Victor Argo.  Why don't you handcuff yourself to the chair?  It's a stupid thing to do.  It's a stupid thing to do. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, man.  If I get pregnant, if Nicole gets pregnant.  You get pregnant.  If I get Nicole pregnant, the right way, which I will.  The right way.  I'm dropping them in the mail slot, Ant.  All right.  I hear you.  Okay.  I am a huge penis.  But you're not like Chuck Knobloch, where they're just going astray.  No, man.  I hit Keith Olbermann's mom in the face.  Hey, that's a good line.  We got to get out. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  Whoa, you got an 18-year-old's ass.  I know.  Well, we want Lana for coming in and showing off that 18-year-old baby.  Oh, my gosh.  This offended me.  I was very upset.  You got to use the word junk, I think.  Yeah.  So your mom was saying how small his junk was.  How small Jay's junk was.  And I was very...  So I let her have it.  It was almost as if she was talking about my junk.  She was like, once you're married, it is my junk as well.  Right.  And I just wanted to scream out, Jeannie, it bricks up lovely, yo. 
[02:52:30]  Nicole Ann Moore, let's keep it going.  Eight and a half.  Eight and a half.  She's getting into it.  It's the 18-year-old.  I wanted to really scream.  Please, please, Opie, come on.  I'll give you a better laugh.  Let me give you guys a better laugh.  Hey, Nicole from L.A. is enjoying you.  Honey, I thought you were here with me.  Oh, Lord. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, man.  I will never be able to apologize enough to your listeners.  That is so terrible.  That's your laugh?  Here, let me give you a better one.  You like it.  How about something sexy?  How about...  All right, go ahead.  Oh, God.  Oh, God, that was terrible.  Well, let me ask Nicole from L.A.  Do you like that?  I choked on that.  I choked.  I choked.  That was an official choke.  My wife choked.  Oh, God.  Oh, you've got a choke.  I am going to choke.  You've got a choke.  Oh, man.  This is terrible. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, man.  You poor people.  I want to thank...  I want to thank that 18-year-old.  Yes.  Hey, let me see if it's still hot.  Let me touch where I spanked her.  It was really hot.  Could you spank her as we leave?  Oh, my gosh.  It's still hot.  Oh, you're going to hurt her.  Will you spank her vagina?  Jay, thanks for sharing today.  Use my junk to spank her vagina.  Thanks for sharing today.  No sweat. 
[02:54:00]  I want to thank someone that's not even a sponsor on our show yet.  Planet Java.  Oh, yeah.  You got all strung out today.  Who else tried the tremble?  I did.  I did.  I drink two of them.  They're amazing.  They're amazing, right?  Oh, I'm buzzing.  I think you're on crystal meth.  Jay, do you like the tremble?  Help me out in the St. Patrick's Day weekend.  I know.  Hey, you're Vince Mc...  What were you going to say?  All right.  Hey, there's a handprint on www.com.  The pictures of Lana's spanked ass are up now. 
[02:54:30]  Yes, thank you.  That was a good Vince impression, by the way.  I really got to hand it to you.  A lot of people, if I didn't talk to Vince, would have thought it was me.  So, but, you know, coming out like that.  Oh!  And the dice is out of his way.  Give us a quick dice.  I'm over here now.  Oh!  Stubbing his toe.  Watch it again.  The dice is getting kicked in the gut.  All right.  Jay, are you coming back tomorrow? 
[02:55:00]  I'm flying to France tomorrow.  What are you doing there?  It's a fag country, you know.  I know.  They love action.  They love action in France.  They brought the action.  Action!  Action!  Action, Monsieur Moore.  They sometimes, or they did their voiceover in French.  They gave me a black voice.  Yeah.  Action!  Wendy!  Wendy!  The deepest voice is the gay guy, Jack Klotnick.  Yeah.  He's like, pika.  I didn't know what I was going to say, pa.  Jay's going to get us the French version of action.  Uh-huh. 
[02:55:30]  It's hilarious.  It's funny, even in French.  They did such a good job at it that it's just funny watching these people scream at each other.  You know what I hear?  They love XFL game day.  Right.  So we're going to go there and try to tape a couple.  Yeah.  That's a good idea.  Hey, that's real football, man.  I want to hear Buddy Hackett in French.  Well, the first time I lost my virginity, because there were several or eight times,  there was a French prostitute who said, oui.  And her head was going up and down really hard. 
[02:56:00]  I said, to him, sir?  That means, do you like it, Anthony?  Yes.  And she said, why do you say that?  And I said, well...  Well, she said it in French.  Pourquoi tu disas?  I said, because your head's going up and down.  She said, oh, you've got a piece of my scarf in there.  With that, we'll see everyone tomorrow. 
[02:56:30]  Quickly, though, I'm reading this on eBay.  Jay Moore's seed is being sold on...  I think you were Swingold.  Well, there's not many of them, so you know it's a living in addition.  Living in addition, people.  Be Daleks!  I'm 18K, it's all I'm trying to tell you now.  Be Daleks!  I got a call for my folks in Buckhead.  I'm 18K, it's all I'm trying to tell you now.  Buckhead!  All right, man, we will see you tomorrow.  Thank you, you know, last.  Have fun.  Have fun in Paris. 
[02:57:00]  Thanks, guys.  I'll call you before it flies, in case I die.  Bye!  It's another Opie and Anthony Rose show.  It's Thursday night at the Vanderbilt in Plainview, Long Island.  Stores open at 6.  O&A will be there after the show.  21 and older only, get directions and other info on WNEW.com.  9027. </pre>
