<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a shockingly inappropriate intro referencing necrophilia, immediately setting the tone for the rest of the show.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with in-studio guests Jim Brewer and Adam Ferrara, then launched into a discussion about strippers, including a caller who surprisingly claimed that strippers had completely turned him off.  This segued into a promotion for a “WOW” sticker giveaway at a Queens beer distributor, sponsored by R.C. Edge Maximum Power Cola.

A substantial portion of the show focused on conversations with Brewer and Ferrara.  Brewer shared stories about his early career, the shifting dynamics of his relationships with famous people who achieved success, and a hilarious (and offensive) anecdote about a family car ride. He also detailed his experiences at various comedy clubs, particularly the Eastside Comedy Club.  Ferrara recounted his relationship with Opie’s sister, his early career struggles, and negative encounters with unscrupulous comedy club managers.  The conversation was consistently punctuated by vulgar and offensive jokes, encompassing discussions of sex, bodily functions, and the use of racist and homophobic slurs. Brewer’s Joe Pesci impersonation and Ferrara’s comedic “walk” were also highlighted.  A Time Out New York commercial aired during this section.

The show also featured a recurring segment, a “Stoner Spelling Bee,” which involved screening callers who identified as marijuana users to participate in a spelling competition while seemingly high.  Callers' backgrounds and professions were briefly discussed, and several were deemed unsuitable due to sobriety or other substance use.  The selected contestants, often interrupted by the hosts' lewd comments and anecdotes, attempted to spell words.

Interspersed with the guest segments were discussions of concert experiences from the 70s and 80s, which involved numerous accounts of dangerous behavior, such as throwing fireworks into crowds at Judas Priest and Iron Maiden concerts.  These recollections transitioned into stories about the hosts' high school antics, including pranks on teachers and classmates that involved vandalism and bodily functions.  Explicit descriptions of strip club experiences on Long Island were also shared.  A caller discussed a planned Pocono trip, and there was mention of a woman named Candy getting a butt tattoo (featuring a cherub, cigarette, and vodka bottle, with the O&A logo added later) in another studio.  The hosts also recalled memories of the Amityville Horror House and their high school days.  Anthony's brother, Joe, called in to complain about the lengthy hold times on his supposedly free internet phone service.

Further segments included a call from Jay Moore, commenting on the show’s humor;  advertisements for Stacker 2 fat burner and Earthlink internet service; and a detailed discussion about Jim Brewer's experiences working with Norm MacDonald on Saturday Night Live, featuring stories of MacDonald's unrestrained and offensive on-air behavior and interactions with other cast members, including Pamela and Tommy Lee. A clip featuring Norm MacDonald telling homophobic jokes was played.  The hosts also discussed an upcoming wiffle ball game between Opie's brothers and a team including Brewer and Ferrara, recalling past games and Brewer’s impressive, possibly alcohol-fueled, hits.  The show's various segments were connected by a continuous thread of vulgar humor, offensive language, and outrageous storytelling.  The "Stoner Spelling Bee" continued throughout several segments, culminating in Amy's win, with numerous sexually suggestive comments directed toward the contestants.  The show concluded with further discussion of Candy's butt tattoo and the ongoing "Stoner Spelling Bee".  The overall tone was consistently informal, irreverent, and highly offensive.

Cool.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone line.  And if you want to send in a FU fax, that's the best way to do that.  Fax line 2-1-2-9-5-7-9-6-3-9.  Opie and Anthony.  Jack, can we get these illiterates off the air, please?  We suck.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W. 
[00:05:00]  And?  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  Okay, terrific.  And cut.  Opie and Anthony.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Did I just miss something good?  Oh, God, man, that's good.  It's the O&A show.  Look who's in the studio.  Brewer.  He doesn't feel like sitting down.  That could be scary right off the bat.  Jim Brewer in the studio, everyone. 
[00:05:30]  Brewer, let him rip.  Brewer quickly becoming our favorite guest.  Yes.  The listeners really dig in the Brewer.  We have a lot of fun.  The Brewer appearance is on the show.  A lot of fun when Brewer's on.  He would have been on for the first break of the show, but he had to check in with the wife.  I had to check in with the wife to make sure it's cool.  Now, what were you telling me?  Wait, lift up, lift up, lift up.  All right, guys.  Am I there?  Yeah.  What were you telling me?  Well, we go way back with Brewer.  I started talking to Brewer when I was working at BAB on Long Island.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Remember I did knock in the back door? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  I was like knocking out the back door.  Oh, I'm Spokey here, man.  Tell me a comedian.  I'm playing at the brokerage.  Right.  I'm at the brokerage.  This was before SNL and all that stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Before all that stuff.  When I was just like the pigeon guy.  Yeah.  Guy, I'm like a pigeon.  Yeah, remember.  I must say, you haven't changed much over the years.  Nah, man.  This is nice.  Because there's other people we've talked to and watched your career blossom and they  don't want to know us anymore.  I've changed. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  I'm a real son of a bitch.  You're an evil.  Yeah.  What happened to you, man?  First time I was on a show, you were a nice guy.  Cool.  Now you're just like a dead guy.  You're a guy.  Goo Goo Dolls.  Anyway.  Goo Goo Dolls.  What?  It's true.  I know.  We had the Goo Goo Dolls on the show up in Boston.  A few times when no one knew who they were.  You guys are so great.  Thanks for having us on.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  They hung out.  They were cool.  When that song Name was out and they were just finally getting some airplay and they 
[00:07:00]  did an acoustic version for a CD we put out and stuff.  And then that was it.  And then they started getting huge and then like every visit just got worse and worse.  We'll be on.  We'll talk next week.  Just got worse and worse.  And then they just flat out stopped coming around because they didn't need us anymore.  Well, that happens.  That happens all the time with you big shots.  Well, hopefully.  You know what?  What happens is these people and I tried killing them. 
[00:07:30]  Yo, don't bug out, man.  You know?  Do what you got to do, but.  Stay grounded, man.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying.  Keep it real.  Keep it real.  I'm still fat.  I'm playing softball on Wednesday.  I've got my mid-socks.  Come on.  And I'm sliding hard, Hammer.  We're not taking our shirts off.  I was telling Brewer during the commercials, like I said, we go way back and when we were  doing our radio show in Boston, Brewer checked in and he was doing some, I don't know, an 
[00:08:00]  interview for something live from his car.  Yeah.  He was driving.  You were driving from his car.  You were driving on the LIE, matter of fact.  You had your wife in the car and either her parents or your parents.  Probably mine.  And we were getting into some just wild discussion.  And obviously your wife and the parents couldn't hear what we were saying.  So you said something just completely outrageous.  I forget now.  And all of a sudden you hear your wife in the back of the car go, what? 
[00:08:30]  And all of a sudden you had to defend your wife.  You go, but honey, you should hear what they're saying on the other end of this line.  I'm not on here with Larry King right now, you know?  You were talking about something that was just so wrong.  Chicks will challenge that point.  Girls, you know, you've been married 50 years.  They were like, right before you get the big gig.  And I know you've been knocking out the door.  And this is like the show.  This is the show we send the whole moving bubble bubble.  Right. 
[00:09:00]  The big gig.  And there she is.  Like, hold on a second, because I'm not feeling great about our last topic,  and I really think we should finish this.  I know you have to go in a few seconds, but I really need to talk to you.  Perfect timing.  Funny, I'm going to film a movie.  That's when you take your hamper and you just start dumping.  All right, it's out of one.  You want to slob?  Oh, wait! 
[00:09:30]  What's that?  Uh-oh, no, it's the slob police.  Oh, guilty.  Break out the handcuffs.  The slob police, yeah.  I'm sorry that I leave this shirt on for three weeks.  Oh, no!  And not like there's a whole film crew waiting for you to get there and stuff, right?  Can't you tell them to wait?  You're the star.  It's more important to talk about why you can't pick up your goddamn underwear  and put it in the hamper, which is right over here. 
[00:10:00]  But, honey, I'm going to film a movie.  Do you have to leave?  There's toothpaste in the bathroom sink.  Is DeMiro going to send your mother a Mother's Day card?  Is that what he's doing?  Oh, I didn't know you guys were such close friends.  They really care about you, idiot.  I'm going to do what you do, because I'm not sitting there and find another cheesy garden  and have you have the yamsack.  The yamsack.  And tell me that you didn't like the card I picked out. 
[00:10:30]  Well, if you write it.  It's funny.  It's funny for me, because it's a distant memory.  I'm sweating.  Swamp ass.  That's what I realized.  I heard that the other day.  Bro, we're keeping up with the show.  I like that.  I realize.  Yeah, man.  Dude.  Yeah, you're in it, man.  I need that.  Now you're in it.  It's like crack now.  See?  The show's like crack. 
[00:11:00]  By the way, my brothers do want to play a wiffle ball.  Let's do that.  Get a wiffle ball game together?  Does Adam play?  Yeah, Adam will play.  Sure.  He runs real funny.  We've got to have him run in the studio.  Here's Adam running up the stairs.  Now, it's great.  It's radio, so no one can see this.  His legs will fly out to the side while he runs.  I know people that run like that.  We were used to laughing at him all the time.  We've got to make him run when he gets here.  Run, Adam, run.  Run, Adam, run. 
[00:11:30]  I can't take a shot yet.  No?  You can't.  Come on.  Yeah, you can't.  The guy was banging my sister for a while, so I can say anything I want.  And he flirted with my sister, too.  Wow.  Yeah, when he was playing Fast Eddie in Huntington.  I love the guy like a brother.  Like a brother, I love Adam.  But he is one of the stupidest individuals when it comes to certain things.  He's going out with my sister, right?  He's banging my sister. 
[00:12:00]  But then he's hanging out with me and my brother Joe in the bar talking like guys talk about how he was, like, sucking face with this other chick.  And my brother's like, Adam, I will break your effing face open, you stupid son of a bitch.  So, of course, my brother went to my sister and said, you know, Adam's a great guy.  We love hanging out with him and stuff.  But I don't think he's really a good guy for you to maybe get serious about or anything.  This is when he's doing stand-up? 
[00:12:30]  I mean, he still does it.  A few years ago?  This was three days ago.  That was just last week.  This bitch is gigging Georgia.  And this big old Georgian ass flapped over a table, left some knuckle marks in her buttocks.  Man, it was great.  How's your sister?  Oh, it's great.  This has gone back maybe ten years.  Smack her in the head, came back.  Got caught in the undertow.  It was like ten years ago, so it's a while ago.  You know, we could all look back in laughter now. 
[00:13:00]  I had no clue you guys were tight like that because I think we're all together.  Adam, I, Kevin James.  Kevin James, yeah.  And his brother, we were all down at Eastside.  The Eastside crew at Minervini, man.  I broke that.  You ever been in Eastside?  Remember the old Eastside at Minervini?  Yeah.  Well, remember?  Hey, guys, I'll make it real tight tonight.  I'll make it real tight tonight.  Get some Thomas things with us.  Big and Richie, right?  Wow.  There's a message. 
[00:13:30]  I can pay you $40.  What about you?  I don't know how many people in the door.  This was here last week.  He went to South.  He went to South.  He went to South.  Well, they had a big glass, um...  Remember there was like a booth, like a disco booth in the back?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, ladies and gentlemen.  All eight of you, welcome to the Eastside Comedy Club, where it's bring whoever you want  for free night.  Get drunk and yearn on the opening act. 
[00:14:00]  Let him know his mother likes being kidney punched.  Welcome to the home of Eddie Murphy.  I don't think Eddie stepped foot in the place after, like, 82.  82, probably in the late 70s.  They would always say that, though, the home of Eddie Murphy.  Yeah, that was, like, the big, famous guy that came out of it. 
[00:14:30]  And, uh, what's his name?  Bob, uh...  Come on, the guy went...  My number 42.  Bob Nelson.  Bob Nelson.  Oh.  He's been playing that act for 15 years.  That was funny for five minutes.  You could get seriously killed.  Okay.  I remember saying.  I had this glass mirror thing in front of it, and, uh, now we can tell the truth. 
[00:15:00]  It doesn't matter anymore.  Ah, time.  I'm trying to think about how it was at it, and I, I don't know, I was all hopped up,  and I was showing my friend, oh, I was imitating this brawl I got.  I got a brawl in Virginia.  You know, I smacked myself around.  Yeah.  Anyway, I'm sitting, I'm like, yeah, that was crazy, and I used to take karate.  So I start imitating the thing, and all of a sudden, my foot, the window thing,  and I hear it.  And we all just stood there, you know, and my one friend's like, oh, I didn't see nothing, 
[00:15:30]  man.  We were just hanging out.  It exploded.  Right, right.  I didn't see nothing.  I didn't see nothing.  And we're the only ones in the blazes.  I get Tuesday night or something like that.  How many times have you used that line before?  I didn't see nothing.  All I ever heard after that was like, hey, that thing cost me, how are you doing?  It cost me a lot of money.  Come on, bring me the nice things in here, try to keep the first night.  Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, I was looking to join. 
[00:16:00]  I'm trying to make a respectable comedy club.  Yeah, but I tore the place up.  I ate his chicken wings, and I broke his window.  And this was going back, like you said, with Adam was just starting in comedy back then.  But I knew him years ago, man.  Yeah, yeah, the walk.  There's the walk.  There's the walk.  Another visual.  You walk out on stage, how you doing here, pal?  Sure.  Another great visual for the radio audience.  I'll have to put a little mpeg of it up on the website. 
[00:16:30]  It's pretty funny.  But, yeah, I knew Adam when he was, like, still in high school over at Walt Whitman and Huntington.  And then, you know, he was selling water filtration systems trying to get me into that business.  Oh, man, this is the best thing.  You're going to love this.  No money to start your own business, pal.  So, it's like Ralph Cramden coming up for me.  All you do is turn a wrench, Norton, and you're making millions.  The next thing I know, he's doing an open mic night at Eastside Comedy.  They loved him. 
[00:17:00]  And that was it.  Do you remember the magician, dude?  The guy that his whole act was, like, a fake magician.  He'd come out.  He'd take, like, Superman.  He'd go, stronger than I get there.  He'd throw Superman against the floor.  And then he tried to do, like, real magic after, like, 20 minutes.  Everybody's like, no!  No one wants the real magic.  Oh, dummy!  There are a couple of things you just don't want to see when you go to a comedy club.  And a magician, I think, is one of them. 
[00:17:30]  But he was funny.  And female comics.  He played it.  This is an outrage.  On Comedy Central tonight, Comedy Twats.  So, Jim, we've talked about this many times on the show.  Aunt and I will go to Caroline's, whatever, and as soon as they go, please welcome Melissa,  whatever, as soon as we hear the female name, we're like, nothing.  I got to take a leak.  Let's order another round of beers.  Oh, I really want to hear the PMS bit again.  How my mom doesn't like the men I go out with. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  Let me tell you about the last guy I dated.  Oh, talk about the old...  You don't have nipple hair?  I hate that!  Yeah.  Clack them, and it gets me treating your thighs.  I hate that!  Kind of having a problem keeping my weight off, in case you haven't noticed.  Okay, well, laugh at your fat hips.  Great.  Great.  He's always one of your friends going, yo, man, I'd totally do her.  I can't.  She is the best looking, but there's something about her. 
[00:18:30]  I wouldn't mind just leaving a nice red mark on her forehead, dude.  Oh, come on!  That's wrong.  Dude, what?  Come on.  The worst person to sit in the crowd with and go to see...  Hey, it's Adam!  Hey!  Look at his funny walk!  Look at his funny walk!  Adam Ferrara.  Good, booger.  Hiya, pal.  We've already been through your funny walk and how you bang my sister.  Oh, I'm getting the hell out of here.  And we're following up the next hour with Hospitaliano.  Are you ready? 
[00:19:00]  So, we're trying to play Ope here and his family.  Yeah, we're going to do a wiffle ball game.  Oh, play Wiffle Ball the game?  Yeah.  Which wiffle ball?  The one I saw in the audience?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We need a new bat.  We need a new bat.  Yeah, that's worth the buying thought.  If there are any ladies out there that want to set the wiffle ball bad record today, please give an open invitation.  We're almost there.  Relax.  Let me get the aluminum.  Oh, that's cold.  Once again, Adam's evil twin here in the studio, the goateed Adam. 
[00:19:30]  Wow.  See, I'm trying to do that to you.  That's the first time I've seen you in years with facial hair.  It took me years to get here.  Is it?  You've been growing it since I...  The voice just finished changing last week.  Are you kidding me?  How was Governor's last night?  A wonderful experience was had by all.  The room looks good now, doesn't it?  Nice, yeah.  Jimmy got the home loan approved.  They brought him plants and everything.  Oh, nice.  I saw that, yeah.  He did it.  Spursing up the joint.  Yeah.  Because they had the... 
[00:20:00]  They got the stage now with the dressing rooms behind it.  Yeah.  So the comic doesn't have to walk through the crowd.  That's right.  Yeah.  Because I...  Harry Trey's.  You used to have to do that.  Deliver some drinks.  Deliver some drinks on your way up.  Yeah, Jimmy, the owner.  Do me a favor.  Drop these off at table six before you...  Yeah, on your way up.  Listen, Jeff Sobrowski's doing an hour and a half before you.  Hi, Sobrowski.  That escalator bit kills me.  Hi, Jeff Sobrowski.  Hey, but I got to say, I ripped off the Minoveni impression from Adam.  Adam does one of the best Minoveni impressions. 
[00:20:30]  I'm really not saying anything.  Sorry.  Field east side, Jay.  Get me with a bull bat and a camera.  When Adam was doing Gilligan's Island jokes.  Don't start.  We're starting already.  I'm toying with a pal.  Oh, not even...  You're just not even warming up.  Just jumping right in.  Going right for it.  We were all there, man.  Come on, right?  I'm like, dude, White Castle makes you fart? 
[00:21:00]  Dude.  I got one of my big boys.  That's right.  And I was like, clothes that, like, what, um...  There and covers everything.  Yeah.  So, um...  I got pulled over after eating some White Castles.  And the cop goes, you've been eating White Castle?  I said, no, man.  So, he said, you're going to have to fart into the balloon.  I'm like, good night!  You've had three cheeseburgers.  You should be on the road.  Do that!  Follow that, Adam!  Closing strong, man. 
[00:21:30]  Closing with the strong one.  I better open with my Gilligan's Island material.  We were all there, man.  Oh, come on.  Sure.  Sure.  They must have seen something, though, Adam, you know?  What?  Well, years ago when you did the open mic night.  God knows that we didn't.  And all of a sudden they put some papers in front of you.  You signed them and didn't see a dime until about two weeks ago.  Let me tell you something.  We all did that.  Are you kidding me?  Comics are nothing but little hookers. 
[00:22:00]  That's it.  You realize that?  Really?  That's it.  You come in and your wife, your family can say, don't sign this contract.  You're signing your whole life away.  But they said, did you ever see the picture of Eddie Murphy?  They knew him one time.  I mean, I'll sign it.  Now, go on down and pay the price for the dumb metal whore.  You'll be playing in Texas this week for another crime to mind when I fatally stick this bat so far, you pooper, that you'll hear your heartbeat. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, I'm sorry.  Have I not paid you in six years?  Take it, bitch.  I've got a deal at Disney for $10 million to develop your faggot ass.  What are you doing with that wiffle ball bat hanging out of your ass?  I'm playing Chuckle.  Dude, I know, man.  We were all there.  I know which one you're talking about, too.  These managers would come to you.  Any wannabe comics out there don't ever, ever, ever sign anything. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Period.  All right.  You know what I'm saying?  Like the colonel.  Sign here, Elvis.  Uh-huh.  You know what happens, too?  It's early in your careers where you're just starting to work it.  Right.  And there's probably no effing reason to sign anything at that point in your career because  you're still working it.  You're still trying to get recognition.  You can book the goddamn clubs yourself.  Exactly.  You get your little brother.  Yo, man.  Let me give you $10.  Yeah.  Can you call this dude and just tell you and tell you? 
[00:23:30]  Right.  Call my agent, but don't call after six because his mother's making dinner.  You know?  That's what you need to do.  But they wrap you up and there they are pecking at 10% or 15% or 20% of your 20 bucks you're  making that night, maybe.  And they don't care.  It's a fat business because they had a whole bunch of you guys.  A stable.  But I had, there was a crew of us, too, that were on the other side of the ocean.  Right.  And you were on your side of the ocean and we'd constantly meet each other like, yo, man.  Are you getting it?  I'm getting it, man. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, me too, bro.  You know that show that's on now, dude?  That was mean.  And you wonder why I limp.  Dude, we get hardcore rage.  There's so many vultures.  Everybody does.  Behind the music is the whole story of everybody.  They signed it all away.  It happened to them.  They sold platinum, triple platinum, and all of a sudden they saw two cents and he's driving  his Buick LeSabre.  And it was his own mother to say that. 
[00:24:30]  I'm like T-Boz from TLC or something.  Left eye.  I burned the house down.  They wonder why Martin's walking around the streets with a gun.  He's trying to find his agent.  He's shooting on people.  He's down to hit him eventually.  But the funniest part is once you get to a certain point and we know each other and you're walking  through them with all the suits.  Like I walked in on your last Fox pilot you had when I went in.  Yeah.  I walked in to reach for him and we're hugging. 
[00:25:00]  How are you doing?  They're all sitting there going, I guess they know each other.  I mean, that's right, that's right, that's right.  You came in and they go, they liked you, brother.  They're like, he's really, really nice.  But the walk.  The walk.  Was he shot?  And we have sisters that we're concerned about.  I don't want to hear about that crap anymore.  Oh, Cole, don't you really stop with me.  Are you pulling that now?  What?  You're pulling that?  We can't talk about that?  All right.  No, let's go to the tape.  Play me some as-is. 
[00:25:30]  No, I don't want to talk about it.  Play some as-is.  We all had our little music careers early on.  Uh-huh.  We were playing the clubs.  Yeah.  Dude, we all want to be bad.  Yeah, sure.  I was just smart enough not to put anything on tape.  Oh, I'm close to it.  You know something?  There's a few of those gigs that we did up in Poughkeepsie that I'm sure are on tape now.  At the Rocking Horse Ranch?  Yeah.  And let me say something.  No matter how bad we were, your band opened for mine.  That's right.  So I don't want to hear it. 
[00:26:00]  What did Adam play?  What did you play?  I played guitar.  Yeah.  No kidding.  Badly.  Wow.  Everyone was drunk.  It didn't matter.  Yeah.  It was so weird.  The best part was the best trick.  Anthony's brother was a great guitar player.  Yeah, we all know.  And it was funny.  Kid, you know what you got to do?  You turn your monitors way up, put your foot on it when you play the solos, because the vibration  makes your balls hum.  So at least you're getting something.  Yeah.  So then you don't care if you're sucking.  And then Adam wakes up with a pig the next morning.  What? 
[00:26:30]  What?  What?  What?  What did I say?  You know, we have a guest.  Mr. Brewer's here.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, I know.  Hey, whatever you got to do, Adam, I'm just doing it for the ride.  All right.  We got to take a break.  This is going to be a lot of fun today.  Hell yeah.  We got Jim Brewer and, of course, Adam Farrar in the studio.  Brewer, we're playing Stoner Spelling Beat today.  Yeah.  You want to do that?  All right.  We got to get some of our listeners stoned again and try to spell words.  It's funny.  We'll do that in a little while.  Also, we're doing another WOW sticker stop today, Anthony. 
[00:27:00]  Where is that?  RC Edge Maximum Power Cola.  If you want to get the WOW stickers, we're going to be at 69th Street Beer Distributor,  corner of 69th and Grand Avenue in Masbeth, Queens.  Earl, Tony, and the Invisible Man will be there.  At 4 o'clock.  All right?  Yeah.  Coming to Queens.  Let's get your WOW stickers.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Anthony, time out New York.  Oh, yeah.  You're going to be in New York.  You want something to do? 
[00:27:30]  Time out New York.  The obsessive guide to impulsive entertainment.  You don't want to be walking around not knowing what the hell to do.  You need a guide to the hip, fun stuff to do in the city.  Time out New York.  Pick it up on the newsstand.  And it's everywhere.  You see it prominently displayed.

You could choose wisely using their Summer Movie Preview Guide. 
[00:28:00]  Great cover, too.  They got a Tandy Newton.  Tandy Newton.  Not Thandy.  It looks like it's Thandy.  It's spelled T-H-A-N-D-I-E, but for some reason it's Tandy.  Yeah, she's in Mission Impossible, too, so, yeah.  All right, it's Time Out New York, the obsessive guide to impulsive entertainment.  If you want a home subscription, it is a very good magazine to have.  Call 1-888-GET-T-O-N-Y.  That's 1-888-GET-T-O-N-Y.  Time Out New York, the obsessive guide to impulsive entertainment.  Get it and get out. 
[00:28:30]  Wow.  And Anthony's.  Scott and G.  It's 1027-WNEW.  It's F.U. Friday.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Brewer, Adam Farrar in the studio.  212-757-1027.  It's also F.U. Friday, Anthony.  Yeah.  Simone from Jersey writes,  Hey, guys, I want to send an F.U. to my bitch boss.  She told me the shirt I was wearing today was a little too revealing.  Wow.  She says I'm violating the dress code.  I guess she's mad because I'm a 34-D and she's a 34-Bored. 
[00:29:00]  Oh.  Wow.  That happens in the workplace.  A little pissed off.  She's a dancer.  Yeah, right?  She could get away with it there.  In the strip club.  All right.  I think we're going to play Stoner Spelling Bee in a little while.  Yeah.  After we riff with these guys a little more, Jim is like,  Jim, are you on like crystal meth or something tonight, man?  Look at you.  Repetually.  It's tough, dude. 
[00:29:30]  I don't play.  I'm up with the times, Hammer.  Yeah.  Nice head, Opie.  Woody, you are nothing.  Thank you.  I'm on.  Come on.  Thank you, Benadryl boy.  Don't you hate guys when they go, hey, man, what do you want?  And you go, I'm on a natural high.  Come here, dick.  What is a natural high?  Pop, you snot.  I'm high on life.  Yeah.  Nice head.  Nice head.  And I was paying for my drugs. 
[00:30:00]  All right.  I saw Jim Brewer on Comics Come Home a couple of weeks ago, and he was freaking hysterical.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  Can you do some Joe Pesci for us?  Go ahead, Jim.  Do you get requests for Pesci, like, in bars and stuff?  Oh, man.  They come up, I tell you, man, they come up drunk.  Hey, dude, this is the guy, man.  What is the guy?  You are the sheep.  This is the sheep.  Dude, do it. 
[00:30:30]  Tell me you're the sheep.  You do it for millions of people, man, and you can't do it with sheep now?  Hey, what did Pesci say?  Oh, is that messed up?  What's it like working with the black dudes?  Chabelle, is he like, he's crazy, right?  Yeah, man.  Yeah, it's all crazy.  Yeah, do Pesci, you faggot.  You're a faggot, right?  They say mad, but that's because you're a faggot.  Hey, what a time, Pesci is a faggot. 
[00:31:00]  But the second you say anything to him, all of a sudden, you're the a-hole.  Oh.  You're the guy that, I met that guy, and you were the a-hole.  Dude, you want to step up?  Do you want to step up?  Tell you what, dick, okay?  I play softball on Saturdays, Sundays.  Dude, I'll wipe you out. 
[00:31:30]  I play center field, a-hole.  Step outside.  Do you want to play weak show of manhood?  You know, we used to like you.  Yeah, you're the a-hole.  We had some guy at Sergeant Pepper's a couple weeks ago on Long Island.  A guy that was licking it at me while he was trying to sing on stage.  Occasionally, I like getting together with my brother.  This guy was out of his mind. 
[00:32:00]  Bill Brady, Joe Curry, an occasional bass player.  And we do cover tunes.  A couple of local bars on Long Island.  It's a lot of fun.  Drink beer.  Nothing serious.  Just having a lot of fun.  And some of the listeners came down and stuff.  99.999999% of them, fine.  Great.  Had a great time.  There's always one mother pepper.  This guy, the second we walked in, he's like on me.  Hey, dude, man. 
[00:32:30]  You know, take a picture with me, man.  Which is fine, you know.  Starts off real good.  Oh, he starts off.  Give me your hat.  Give me your hat.  Dude, I'll change it.  I'll change it.  My hat.  His hat looked like the hat like Quint was wearing on Jaws.  It probably smelled the same.  The little brown eel comes out of the key.  And he had like three teeth in his head.  And now I'm his pal for life.  Yeah.  The whole time I'm there, I'm his pal. 
[00:33:00]  So we're playing.  He gets up right next to me as I'm trying to sing and tries to lick my ear.  I'm like, dude, get the...  Away from me.  That same guy came up to me and he was just hammered.  And his friend comes up to me and goes, oh, watch out for that guy.  When he drinks, he gets gay.  Is there something?  Is it being gay when you drink?  Wait, wait, wait.  What are you drinking?  Yeah.  Cosmopolitan.  And then the same guy followed me out of the place. 
[00:33:30]  And, you know, he's like a huge fan, man.  Huge fan.  Just like Ann said.  He goes, can I have your hat?  I'm like, dude, it's my only hat.  I love this hat.  And I wouldn't give it to him, right?  So he goes, you suck, man.  I'm going to start listening to Lib Lens.  You're an ass.  You should get cancer.  I hope you get cancer.  Oh, God.  I'm the king of comedy.  Oh, man.  Talk to my brother.  He's in the hospital with cancer.  Jerry, please.  No, I'm very busy.  I'm on my way to stuff.  Jerry, please.  Just two words.  I'm really busy.  I got to go.  You should get cancer.  I hope you get cancer. 
[00:34:00]  Are you probably going bald, faggot?  That's your bald, faggot.  Faggot.  Your hair on your head.  Where are you from, freaking Suffolk?  At least you don't have to take responsibility.  You know what?  Olive Garden food sucks.  Yeah, Mr. Hospitaliano.  I'm cooking the crap.  You cashed the check now.  Yeah.  You're responsible.  That's it.  We have a witness.  We have a witness to the ear licking.  Mike, you haven't seen the commercial with Adam? 
[00:34:30]  Hospitaliano?  That's Adam.  The Olive Garden.  Get out of here.  No, that's the first one.  Oh, thank you.  Mike, they put a new day going there.  What's going on, Hope?  We're trying to do two different things here at the same time.  Hold on.  That was the December one.  All right, Mike, what's up?  Mike, Mike.  Yeah, I was at Sergeant Pepper's last week, a couple weeks ago, and he said,  that guy looks like Slot from the Goonies.  He gets up in front of the microphone, and he's like, hey, man, do this, do that.  Yeah.  It was all messed up in the head.  And then the second you, like, sort of go, look, dude, I'm doing a gig here. 
[00:35:00]  I'm trying to, you know, do something.  I really need a couple of minutes over here.  What an a-hole, man.  You're such a geek.  You know, the guy wouldn't say boo to me.  I'd tell him what a big fan I am of the show, and he'd tell me to F off.  You know, that's how the story gets translated to his drunken pals and stuff.  Next on News Channel 4, Anthony goes crazy.  He goes postal on a huge fan.  Yeah, man, that happens real quick. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  He always gets changed.  You know, he tried to give me his hat, and I said, no.  I don't want your hat, man.  I made the mistake of, like, because right when I walked in, he was like, let me get you  a beer, man.  Like, oh, okay, cool.  Gave me a beer, and that's it.  That was like a chick.  What it is is that when fans, fans, when they're into you, it's just like when you used to go  out in the bars, and you're the chick now.  He buys you a drink, and now I've got to go home and do whatever this is. 
[00:36:00]  I've got to spread them.  Why don't you drink, man?  Help me paint my basement.  Do Joe Pesci, bat like a goat, and paint my basement.  Bend over the table.  I'm going to rail you.  What's the problem?  You ain't Long Island, faggot.  You drank my beer, though, didn't you?  Yeah.  You drank my beer.  Oh, yeah.  I see what you're all about, man.  I know what I used to do to chicks.  What a dick.  I bought you a beer.  Suck it.  Come on. 
[00:36:30]  The man's on the back.  Good Lord.  Tracy Odo does it.  She just turned 18.  What's the big deal?  Oh, whatever, dude.  I bought her a drink, too.  It wasn't even a beer.  Charlie, I ain't paying for that.  All right, Mr. Brewer, you want me to take the paint back?  No, I'll find someone to help me.  There's a guy that works with you, Anthony, in the band As If? 
[00:37:00]  As Is?  As who?  Yeah, they got it spelled wrong.  Who?  I don't know.  Let's see if this goes anywhere.  James, what's going on?  Hey, James, man.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Listen, me, Foot, and the Chief?  Yeah.  We were like, why do you keep ripping on As Is Finsta?  Even Foot said it.  Well, why not?  Well, because it sucked.  Yeah, of course.  I understand.  Well, we had the good times back then.  Of course.  It was a lot of fun to very bad music. 
[00:37:30]  Okay, good.  As long as we agree on that.  Yeah.  Well, we had a blast.  We used to blow stuff up.  Adam was real good at blowing stuff up.  Yeah, pyrotechnics are always a plus.  Yeah.  You just gather up some gunpowder from various locations, shove it in a pipe, and light it  in front of drunks.  The instructions were great.  Anthony would rig up this stuff, and I'd have to blow it up, but the instructions would  get, all right, wait till the last song, and wait till the owner pays us.  Yeah.  Then hit the button.  Then hit it.  Hit it.  Just make sure Joe Buck's face isn't over the pot. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, my God.  Well, we did a backyard party one time, and it didn't go off.  Yeah, sometimes there was some misfire.  That was a scary moment.  When you pushed the button, it wouldn't fire, and it's like, okay, who's going to go over  there, kid?  It's like that firecracker, that M-80, that fuse just went down.  All right.  Don't go near it, man.  Get the water.  Send Nubby.  He did it last year.  So you go in there like the bomb squad with a pillow or something in front of you.  Exactly.  You're really close, and the one mother's going, get the hell away from there.  What's wrong with you? 
[00:38:30]  But there'd always be one of the crazy bastards that would walk right up to pick it up.  It ain't even lit, man.  Look, there's still some fuse here.  Let me pull it out a little more so there's an eighth of an inch.  No, I'll light it with a sparkler so I can't tell when it's lit.  I'll throw it.  I'll lose my hand.  All right, James.  All right, guys.  Good luck.  Tell everyone I said hi, man.  Thank you.  You got it.  Later.  Tom is claiming you never finished the Sears story last time.  What?  I think he did.  That went way beyond.  Yeah, that was like a Sears-Iraqi connection. 
[00:39:00]  Sure.  He gave up on the show because that story took about an hour and ten minutes.  He probably finally said, oh, screw it.  That was to the point.  That was a hilarious story, though.  Do you know what I'm saying?  I used to wear a T-Z-I Friday's, too.  You did that?  Get out.  Were you the guy with the little badges on you and everything?  I wouldn't, you know, because they...  Wow, what a rebel.  You wouldn't wear the badges.  I'm not wearing the badges, man.  I wouldn't wear a hat. 
[00:39:30]  I'll wear the suspender.  Screw you, man.  I'm my own person.  I'm not wearing the flare.  Oh, that's funny.  Oh, man.  Once I felt really degraded there, I felt like I had to get him back.  So this is a true story.  I'm leaving it.  This other guy, there's a big stoner.  This guy, Joe.  Joe, if you're out there, man, dude, you've got to call him backing me up here.  He comes out.  One day, I was just sitting in our back, and he goes, dude, why can't we all just hang out in life? 
[00:40:00]  So he's one of these dudes.  So we go out, and we're leaving for the day.  And the ice cream truck was delivering.  And he's like, yo, let's take one of the ice cream bins.  I'm like, nah, nah.  He quick grabbed the bin.  And then I grabbed the bin.  I shoved it in my car.  I drove it home.  But their ice cream bins are like huge garbage barrels.  Full of ice cream.  Yes, and then I got home in Valley Stream like 20 minutes later.  It's melted, and I can't shove it in any of my freezers. 
[00:40:30]  And one of my sister's houses, she's like, let me get some Tupperware.  We had like 40 things of Tupperware ice cream.  What a bunch of jackass.  You must have been stoned.  Yeah, the only time you want to.  I was like, I'm stealing ice cream.  I'm making a statement again.  Look at that, T.G.I.F.R.I.S.  Make me wear button faggots.  I'm leaving my Judas Priest jacket. 
[00:41:00]  I'm coming back for the moose's head.  Wild man.  That is funny.  Yeah, but they make you train for two weeks.  For what?  You have to learn, like, oh, man, that was so annoying.  You've got to go into T.G.F.R.I.F.R.I.S.  And there's always one guy that's been out of about seven years.  He's going to tell you.  Philadelphia, Atlanta, and everyone in sales.  Whatever, Dick.  Tell me about the citizen.  Can you believe this guy has 98 buttons?  He's the 98 button guy. 
[00:41:30]  I got this one when I was working, when I was camping in Alaska.  It's like his whole life, man.  I started out as a busboy.  Nice head.  This guy, man.  Oh, shoot.  The red stripes were my idea.  So what the hell did they choose in here?  You've got to learn the menu.  You have to take a test on the menu.  A test?  Yes, you have to take a test.  All right, what's in a fajita?  Guacamole. 
[00:42:00]  And chicken.  And sometimes, oh, man, steak.  Very good, Mr. Brewer.  Don't call me Mr. Brewer.  God, you faggot.  I'm 19, man.  So I sat there.  So my first day, and you have to learn drinks.  Like, I still don't know to this day.  Certain drinks are called like...  Blue Hawaiian?  No, you can't call it like that.  You've got to go, I'll have a high ball to the third power. 
[00:42:30]  That means they've got to use the blender.  Oh.  Oh, you've got to order the drinks in cold.  Yes, you have to order the drinks, and you have to get the glasses.  Right.  Right.  And you have to get the...  Now, I'm in line with these people.  It's busy now.  There's only six people in my whole area, but I'm stressing hard.  Just bring our drinks, and we want mozzarella sticks.  Oh, man.  Nothing more stressful than the food service industry.  And all I took was one jacket is to go, I'll have a blue nipple, hair, hold the ice, and 
[00:43:00]  throw in some bourbon.  Dude, screw me.  Oh, me, I am humped hard.  We're in line with all these serious people.  And they're all like going, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  I'll have a blue, high ball to the seventh power.  Okay, next.  I'll have a...  Um, what do I use?  Get me in line, a-hole, until you learn how to call the drinks in yourself.  Here's the thing.  Go study.  That's what they used to make me do, and I... 
[00:43:30]  And I...  Oh, someone take a table of mine.  Like, well, you should have learned when you passed the test, maybe if you didn't...  Oh, they suck.  Needless to say, the last two weeks after I stole the ice cream, you're like, oh, I'm  out of here.  I'm going to throw in a gel for the ice cream.  That's like high pressure, though, the food service industry.  Because, you know, around lunchtime and dinnertime, it never stops, and you can't just...  I like a job where at any given moment, if you're pissed off or something, you just sit 
[00:44:00]  down and take a breath.  But what are you going to do?  There's people screaming for stuff that...  Oh.  It's disgusting.  It's a...  I know you're hungry.  I'm going to chill.  You're probably pissing me off, man.  My throat is all annoyed.  I'm going to learn these faggot tricks.  I don't know.  I just make it.  Jerk.  You know what I want?  I'm going to call CP3 power.  Everybody's getting the fish. 
[00:44:30]  It should be like an airplane.  You get two choices.  Yeah.  There's...  And this is the thing.  Why would you go to TGI Fridays and order anything but, like, a fajita or a burger?  Right, right, yeah.  I'll have the sea bass.  Well, then you're an A.  What are you doing here?  There's a great...  There's a wrong place.  Great seafood place up the road.  Fresh night out.  All right.  You're all decked out to get some sea bass.  You idiot.  There's a nice, like, seafood restaurant you can go to.  There's that, no.  There's so many people checking in that worked at Friday's. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, I'm sorry, guys.  No, I'm not, man.  Well, let's see what they're going to say here.  Scott, what's going on?  Well, Scott, man.  I used to work at TGI Friday.  Yeah.  What a pain in the ass place to work.  Was it?  What?  You had to take 20 tests to make a burger.  Yes.  Tests.  Yes.  You had tests.  You had to test.  You had to test the bar test.  I had to run around the building in the first two weeks and say, back to the house.  What?  It's because they were competing with the servers and the bartenders, the people that 
[00:45:30]  were cooking.  Yep.  Totally ridiculous.  Happy birthday to you.  Come on.  You had to do that?  No.  Did you have to do that?  Tell me you failed that test.  I learned, but, yo, they hated me.  Happy birthday to you.  Oh, no.  I was just going, looking around the other room.  Look at the breast on that horse.  Just kidding.  Never mind.  I'll get her rolls.  Play on the burger.  Have some rolls anyway.  See you around here? 
[00:46:00]  Have some people?  They're all at the other table.  Happy birthday.  They always disappear.  I'm making some ice cream, man.  You're the guy in the back of the crowd.  Because that always just looks like the most degrading thing.  Why would you have your employees do that?  Does anyone really enjoy that when they're sitting down?  Because it's never the person's birthday that's having the birthday's idea to have that done.  It's like, when they go to the bathroom, they'll call the waiter over and say it's their birthday. 
[00:46:30]  And they'll send over the little cupcake with the candle.  And the whole cast of a-holes will come out and say, happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday.  And the guy sits there going, oh, you bunch of motherfuckers.  Now I've got to sit here.  I look like an idiot.  My favorite is the guy from the kitchen with the accent.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday.  I like this.  You know, good guy.  I make it.  I make it with my feet.  That's, to me, especially like you get the guys and girls in there that they just want to do a job, get their money, get the hell out of there. 
[00:47:00]  And they, it, it, I think it's equal to a secretary in an office and the boss going, hey, why don't you hike that skirt up a little bit, honey?  I think it's just as degrading.  They're there to serve food and do that and they've got to sing goofy songs to people.  However, it is hilarious when, when you're a hammer and you bring like that one guy who knows he'll go to blows if these bananas come home. 
[00:47:30]  You know, you're done like, yeah, yeah, yeah, they're gathering with the balloons over there.  Ah, cool, ah, cool.  I believe you don't see him.  All right, Dicks, who did this?  Oh, man, I did.  Happy birthday to you.  He's just sitting here like, oh, I'm going to bust you.  I'm going to kill you.  Is it funny?  Go away, please.  Go away, please.  Well, that's a candle.  It was that one place that they take out the moose, a big moose.  No, that was up in Boston. 
[00:48:00]  And you had to kiss the moose.  Kiss the moose on your birthday.  What?  I think it was like the Outback or something like that.  Yeah, one of those places.  And it's like, now kiss the moose.  Like, I'm going to stick my stuff in the moose's face in a minute if you don't pull that god damn thing away from me.  I'm going to get a moose job.  That's when you're drunk, Fred.  Remember this old one?  Remember when you pull out your little...  You pull out your pocket.  You want to kiss a bunny?  Who wants to touch the elephant's trunk?  Touch the elephant's trunk. 
[00:48:30]  You pull your pocket.  You pull your pocket.  Do you want to see every kiss the bunny?  No.  Well, here you go.  Oh, you suck.  What an idiot.  Jim, Jim.  John from Amityville.  No.  Oh, man.  John from Amityville writes...  Who did that?  No, I totally did that.  I think I did that on stage.  You ever kiss the bunny rabbit?  Kissed it.  Good night, fall out, Adam.  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim. 
[00:49:00]  John from Amityville writes...  Used to work in Massapequa's Fridays.  Asked Jim to sizzle one of the meals.  Sizzle one of the meals.  Is that a code word for Fridays?  Yeah, I don't really remember.  All right.  You're talking 18.  My time was in some scary places.  I was coming down from Mescaline from the ACDC concert.  I was in dark places.  Did you say ACDC? 
[00:49:30]  He's off.  Brewer playing air guitar.  He was in the fourth row.  Right after Ingevee Mountstain.  Yeah.  Ingevee.  You're a great guitarist.  Well, yeah.  Come on.  I'm hoping you play guitar.  I need some words.  I'm going to see Ingevee.  The cannons are coming up.  Yeah, yeah.  No, man.  Cannon's broke.  High five.  Cannon's broke. 
[00:50:00]  Woo!  You're good.  Woo!  Hey, you don't have to know the words, which is a great thing.  You're listening to what he says.  He walks in the mic.  Stand up.  Count him. 
[00:50:30]  I want the eyes of me.  Sit out.  I'm setting it up in the contest.  What you are about to receive.  We are the demons.  Give me everything I need.  I got three minutes in me.  Now, I'll try to go.  Yeah.  Run away. 
[00:51:00]  You're gonna do.  Oh, Barry, does a great job.  That's hilarious.  That's hilarious.  Like, anyone's got, your guy next to you, Tufiki, you've got to compete with ACDC's PA. 
[00:51:30]  How's the classic?  How can I talk?  Good God, my stomach hurts.  Look it out.  We looked out in the air.  We hit a fucking glass like, yo, Ralph, you've got to fight, dude.  I've got to fight with a black dude.  That was crazy.  You should have done.  You're drinking.  He's like, yo, my people are in a D.C.  D.C.  Fuck those cops.  He's totally cool.  You should have done it if I took them out, man. 
[00:52:00]  We didn't back them up.  We felt like dicks.  We're like, yo, chill out.  He's like, no, man, this is a white thing.  I'm like, no, no, man.  It was a kickoff.  You missed it.  You missed it.  Bah!  Oh, my God.  You're mad, man.  Mad.  Yeah, boy, concerts, though, are a little different back then.  Because you didn't even have to bring anything.  You just sat down, and a big joint would just get handed to you by this guy next to you. 
[00:52:30]  The wine sack.  Hey, dude, I got the wine sack.  So it was a little into your mouth.  And even before that, you had the beach balls.  Yeah, yeah.  Look out, Dick.  Oh, dude, I just missed it.  I just missed it.  I was just close to the beach balls.  Oh, did you touch it?  Dick, don't lie.  Don't lie.  Did you touch it?  Here it comes again.  Here it comes again.  Oh, that's what gets your elbow out of my face, Dick. 
[00:53:00]  You want something?  That's all.  Bring it on.  Bring it on.  And who is insane enough to go to, like, a Charlie Daniels, a Molly Hatchett concert  around the 4th of July?  Oh, you knew M-80s were flying from the top rows onto the floor.  Look, dude, I'm going to throw it.  Don't worry, I'm going to throw it in the air so it blows up above the crowd.  I got it timed out.  Yeah, because these fuses are so accurate.  There's some wang in China that's just going. 
[00:53:30]  He's shoving gunpowder in this little wax tube.  He doesn't know.  He can burn in two seconds.  He can burn in 20 minutes.  And they're lobbing him over the crowd.  It's okay.  It blows up in the air.  Bottle rockets.  I don't know why they would have the Roman candles at the end of the night.  Yeah, Roman candles.  Where's the pink swinking dog?  You pussies don't know what it's like now.  What, you think laser pointers are bad?  So what, you got a little red dot on your head?  Get it on.  How about a friggin' blockbuster going off a foot above your head? 
[00:54:00]  People leave in, like, fog hat concerts with a shock syndrome.  Frickin' shell shock.  You're right, man.  I went to, my first concert was Coliseum Judas Priest.  Oh, God.  With Iron Maiden.  And, like, my city.  I went to, my baggie.  Well, I'm doing our head.  I'm trying to hide.  Who's the guy on, oh, Eddie was the guy on the cover.  Eddie, yeah.  That guy.  It's closer, Eddie. 
[00:54:30]  Eddie.  It's you.  You're in the toilet.  Wait, we're missing Eddie, man.  You're going out.  The best of pink swinks.  What do you think you're going, son?  Eddie.  Eddie.  One, two, three.  The pal that would always, like, dude, I'm Bolton because I'm getting up front.  Yeah.  And the security in every stairway, he's trying to talk his way back. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, here it is.  Need to hear just a bit of this.  Right, right.  Oh, here it is.  Sorry.  One, two, three.  Across the street.  You're the king.  We're the king.  We fought him.  We fought him.  We fought him.  I thought I'd think about it.  We fought him. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, here it is.  Did he have to?  Oh, yeah.  We fought him.  I fought him.  I gave him hell.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  How did he say życie?  Run to the street.  Where is he?  Here we go.  Yeah.  Now it's rocking.  Yes.  It doesn't let him know.  Oh, here we go.  Run to the big-ass sea. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Run to the cave.  Run to the cave.  I'm going to be on the block like, Jerry, I'm going to the hills of God.  I'm going to the hills of God. 
[00:56:30]  Guys, great times.  Those were the days when MTV had, like, 20 videos.  Yeah, they just rotated over and over.  Yeah, Van Halen, Unchained.  Unchained.  Let's make it up.  Wow!  Blue Oyster Cult, I'm burning for you.  There's one of them.  Pat Benatar, Love is a Battlefield.  That one would take way too much.  What was that one in Pat Benatar where they started throwing in some dramatics that weren't part of the song? 
[00:57:00]  Oh, yeah.  Leave me alone!  Centafold, J. Giles Band.  Yeah.  I got into that song for like a month, man.  I'm not going to lie.  I got into that song.  I ran.  Remember that?  Oh, I ran so far away.  Flock of seagulls.  Big budget.  You saw the camera in the mirror behind it.  But they cleverly wrapped it in tinfoil so you might not notice.  What's this flock of seagulls hair doing?  He's in his own tools.  Big budget videos, right? 
[00:57:30]  Well, I'm...  Can Brewer do Rob Halford?  That's how you get a request from him.  Don't even.  I can do any Halford.  Tear it up?  I was Rob Halford.  I was Rob Halford.  All right, hold on.  It's like, hold on, scream for vengeance.  All right, hold on, we'll challenge it.  What's your first song do you need?  Screaming for vengeance?  I can get that high note. 
[00:58:00]  Screaming for vengeance.  Screaming for vengeance.  Screaming for vengeance.  Screaming for vengeance.  I just love how...  Wow, he did it!  He did it!  Yeah!  I don't know, I don't even know what it is, but that's right.

[00:59:30]  That's near the end, right?  Yeah.  Oh, God, you're killing me.  We're going to get your Ronnie James video away.  That was my favorite part.  I think I rewinded a thousand times and my dad would walk in on me.  What the hell is that noise?  I got my headphones on and going, Scream!  What the hell is wrong here?

[01:09:30]  And it was like art gallery week, remember that?  Yeah.  And we were downstairs, and we were in the basement of Valley Street Central,  and they had this art gallery, and Joe came in, and we took the...  Whoa!  Joe's at the back of the teacher's classroom.  Huh?  Wasn't it at the back of the teacher's class?  Well, we did there once, but if you remember, we set...  Well, maybe it was the other Joe.  I won't say his last name, but...  No, it was you, man.  It was a second.  And we put it in the glass thing, and people walk by and go, 
[01:10:00]  Oh, my God!  That was fake.  And then, yeah, remember the principal?  We're sitting in, like, second period,  and the smartasses who are putting that filth in the art gallery,  you will be caught.  And don't think for one second you won't.  And here's the two of us.  Don't do that.  Just farting.  Smell it.  Remember what?  I don't want to say his last name.  Remember what we did to Scott D's camera? 
[01:10:30]  No.  You'll probably remember.  Me and Joe, the other Joe.  You guys were really...  Yeah, we were...  Yeah, we were out of hand.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we were out of hand.  Yeah, we were out of hand.  Yeah, this guy's locker was open, right?  We didn't know whose it was.  So we opened up the locker, and we take a look.  It says, there's a camera.  It's like, oh, man, a camera.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, of course, we took the best possible picture of your stuff.  I was saying, no, we can't feel it.  It's a cheap camera.  So we went into the bathroom.  I dropped my drawers.  He takes a picture of my ass. 
[01:11:00]  And he puts it back in.  Spread nose.  Yeah.  Like a week later, my friend Scott comes up to us.  He goes, you'll never believe it.  The weirdest thing happened.  My mother's sitting there looking at this picture, you know, the picture.  And her face turns white.  She looks at it, this big, hairy rear end.  So me and Joe, we fell on the floor and were like, yeah, isn't that funny?  I'm like, yeah, you don't know how funny it is.  Dude, I'm not lying. 
[01:11:30]  We is the last.  Remember, we finally drove that one poor teacher.  She turned around.  She went, shut up.  Yeah, and I was laughing at the top of my lungs.  And it took us about five seconds.  It was silence and then.  That was at the time we used to listen to that Cheech and Chong album.  Shut up.  Yeah, we all did.  We grew up on that album.  Yeah, I exploded laughing.  We both got thrown out.  And that poor lady, she turns around to us.  You know, you're going to have to stay for detention. 
[01:12:00]  But I don't believe in suspension.  We both looked at each other and were like, oh, my God, this poor lady.  I don't believe in suspension.  I believe you should come here at three.  And we come in every day at three.  Listen, we're really sorry.  And it's just we don't know why we do it.  We're just too really idiots and we totally apologize for our action.  The next day, she would be up there.  Joe, we'd take entire pieces of paper and shove it in our mouth and wait to the end of class  and just whip it across and it'd hit the blackboard and it would make like a 20-inch diameter spin like that. 
[01:12:30]  She'd go, now this is so childish.  So childish.  Yeah, we were a little off the wall.  Wow.  Yeah, but we had a lot of fun.  The one thing that blows my mind for the day, Jim, how did we pass that class?  How did we?  Because she had a heart.  That's all right.  Yeah, I think she passed the class.  She didn't want you to get left back.  We quit that year, too.  We literally, for three quarters of the year, we did nothing but sit, laugh, throw spitballs. 
[01:13:00]  Bust on Dina's edge.  Whatever, Dina, nice face.  How ugly can you be?  What did you want to be again?  She wanted to be Madonna.  Yeah, right.  She looked like Madonna.  I wanted to be a fashion consultant or something like that, and we just sat and laughed at her.  Oh, no.  She's a horror.  She's probably a crack war now.  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  I am pretty.  That's terrible.  Oh, man.  It's not even fun.  It's terrible. 
[01:13:30]  You destroyed her.  Those memories are probably still in her head.  It's not a sock on my head.  Whatever.  Yeah, right.  It's a fashion thing.  Remember Hickey Hirsch?  Weren't you in my class with Hickey Hirsch?  Oh, yeah.  Hickey Hirsch.  Well, Hickey Hirsch, well, he had this big red spot on him.  Draw attention right to it, like kids can do.  Anyway, one day, Steve, I forgot.  Oh, Steve R, he's sat in the back row, and Hickey Hirsch is checking out, what does it say? 
[01:14:00]  Cousin Strawberry.  Oh, okay.  Thanks, Rick.  Strawberry, Nick.  Anyway, Hickey Hirsch came in, he had crazy hairdo.  It was just, the poor guy had nothing going on, ruthless.  Him, it was the Twitch guy.  I think every skull has one, yeah.  And if you pissed him off, you're like, yeah, whatever.  Keep your head still.  You sure you didn't go to Harborfield's high school?  I remember all these characters.  Yeah, everyone had the Twitch guy. 
[01:14:30]  This is how immature and retarded we were.  Hickey Hirsch is checking homework, and as he's just about to get to me, remember Steve R,  I won't say his last name, but he reached out with his finger,  and he's pretending he's taking, and he's going, and Hickey Hirsch turns around,  and he goes, well, did you get any?  And we laughed for like the next two weeks.  And then we see Steve, we just look at him, and we just saw our fingers go,  did you get any, Steve?  Barry, you got caught, Dick. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, my God.  That's why you're a professional, Dick, because you got caught.  Wow.  I'll never forget, I'm going to the bathroom, and, you know, I'm on the urinal,  and I turn around, and there's Joe, and he's up on the ledge.  I go, what are you doing?  And he goes, well, Pete, I didn't want to wait to come in to lunch.  Joe, what are you doing?  They're all looking up. 
[01:15:30]  He used to, he went, and back in Valley Street and Sancho's, this little lake with all the real tiny frogs.  I don't know if they get bigger, but they're only like, you know, the size of the top of your pinky.  Yeah.  And he, and this other dude, I'm not lying, would get, like, bundles of bundles of these frogs.  And then the bell would ring, and they'd shove him right by the door, so you'd have to step on top.  Oh, no. 
[01:16:00]  And everyone knew who it was.  You're like, oh, man.  Those are the guys that you used to, if you didn't have the balls to do something, but you had the materials, you would give it to them.  Oh, yeah.  Because we had those, yeah.  Like, if you came in with a 10-ounce or 12-ounce bottle rocket, and you didn't want to set it off,  you knew who to go to to set it off right down the hallway.  Yeah.  You know, the lunatics, the ones that would flush the Blockbuster down the toilet.  The stink bomb.  The stink bomb guy.  Yeah.  The guy that was being brought out by the police. 
[01:16:30]  So it's that guy.  Nothing more fun than being dragged out by the police.  Or brought out, I remember one kid, in a wheelchair, because he was so effed up.  Like, he went under the bleachers and was drinking, and he was so effed up in class that the ambulance came.  With a wheelchair?  And the sight of him, like, just rolling out the front door of John Glenn in a wheelchair.  Wow, man.  And that never leaves you.  Like, if I saw him tomorrow, I would go, oh, it's the wheelchair, dude. 
[01:17:00]  It's the drunk wheelchair guy.  No, that's our congressman.  Yeah, yeah.  He could be now, but it doesn't matter.  He's a drunk wheelchair guy.  He'll always be.  Yeah, he'll always be that.  There was one guy, slow in our class.  I think it was County or something like that.  And I always felt, I always had, you know, when a kid was a little off, it always really pissed me off when everyone was making fun of him.  It's the only place where I'd feel and come, like, yo, man, leave.  Even you had a line.  And they're like, yo, come on.  And they call him, like, Roy Zero. 
[01:17:30]  So one day they talked to him.  They're like, Roy, you want to be cool?  Jump out the window.  Sure, he goes to the bed.  It was only on the first floor.  You know what it would be cool.  And he opens up the window, and the accountant is sitting out, Roy, you jump out that window, Roy.  Roy, don't jump, Roy.  If you want to be cool, jump out.  And we won't avoid that anymore, sure enough.  Out the window he goes.  Terrible.  Jim admitted, you're right. 
[01:18:00]  Jesus Christ, man.  Drew, you want to buy some candy?  No, I don't.  Allison.  How are you doing?  Great.  We're having fun today.  This is the funniest ass I've ever heard in my life.  I feel like I'm living through high school again.  Yeah, everyone went through it.  I used to cough at the foot of the pantyhose and, like, right at the thigh and wear that in my hair.  I was a Madonna wannabe. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Madonna wannabe.  And it was the patron-stable sluts in high school.  Right on.  All right.  Were you a slut?  No.  You just wanted to look like one.  No, I wanted to look like one.  Yeah, now I am.  But back then, no.  All right.  All right.  Take care, guys.  Thank you, Allison.  Yeah, we had a gym teacher named Gil Lilienthal.  Gil Lilienthal.  Big guy.  Cute.  Big fat guy.  Right.  And the story was, he was on the Denver Broncos until the tragic leg injury reduced him to 
[01:19:00]  a high school gym teacher.  And he has the bitterness to prove it.  Yeah.  He played two games.  Yeah.  The guy was, like, breaking records and stuff.  And then all of a sudden, the hamstring went, dude, he's pissed.  That is so funny.  Yeah.  We had a teacher, the same thing.  Dude, he had a tryout with the New Jersey Nets, man.  And he effed up his knee.  And that was huge.  Yeah.  Please.  All right, kids.  I'm going to take out all my hostilities on your sorry little asses. 
[01:19:30]  Push-ups for no apparent reason.  Our gym teacher never made it to that point.  He gave us, like, the birds and the bees talk, the health talk.  Oh, yeah.  That one, yeah.  Because, you know, he had to.  The guys were climbing the ropes.  Come down, Billy.  Not yet.  You know, like they're stuck in the rope.  He had, like, scotch on his breath.  It's like, man, I know you've been experiencing some urges.  Ignore him.  Because if you don't, you'll knock up a cheerleader, and then you'll have to marry her and become a frigging gym teacher. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, this big guy was, he would get so pissed off.  If you were smoking, he would give you a choice.  You could either go to the principal, or he will punch you once.  And he would drag you in and punch you in the stomach.  Really?  He would punch you.  You have a choice.  You go to the principal, or here, put on this mask that looks like my wife, and I'll punch you in his stomach.  You'll bet my leg.  I was a Denver Bronco.  And then he was, he was, like, so pissed off.  And then the rumor was, I don't know what the true story is.  It might be true, it might not.  I don't even know. 
[01:20:30]  Is that he hit some kid with a pipe, and then he disappeared.  He was gone.  It was just, one day, Gil was gone.  Gil was gone.  And the story was, dude, he caught Tommy Slater smoking.  And, like, took a lead pipe and smacked him over the head with it.  But what made him do that, dude, was when Tommy said F.  Hey, what a pisser, man.  Oh, yeah, man.  I remember that. 
[01:21:00]  That was awesome.  We had a fat guy, I think passed away, but he used to call everyone bananas.  Hey, bananas!  I called him, whatever, no-night.  Hey, Mr. Blimey, come on, come on.  They're wacky little names for you.  We had a music teacher that had such bad dandruff.  It was, like, all of, like, snow drifts on his shoulders.  And he would come in, and if we were too rambunctious during bugle class, he'd be like,  At ease, disease.  That was, like, his big catchphrase.  At ease, disease.  Every day he would use it like it was the first day he ever said it. 
[01:21:30]  At ease, and he thought it was the funniest damn thing.  You're rambunctious acting, at ease, disease.  Oh, the at ease, disease again.  He'd be in the back going, yeah, whatever, dick.  Dick.  Dandruff head, dick.  What, he's going to say, at ease.  At ease, disease.  At ease, disease.  Hey, Chris, what's going on?  Hey, I got a question for Adam.  Yeah.  You went to Whitman, right?  Yeah.  You remember the two dikey ones, Rabideau and Hohenrath?  Rabideau.  The two dikey ones. 
[01:22:00]  Rabideau and Hohenrath.  What year did you graduate?  78.  Dykey female gym teacher.  No, I graduated in 84.  Yeah.  Ah, they were gone, I guess.  I guess they left together.  Yeah, maybe.  I was dating a spy chick, and she said, those are guys, man.  Really?  Well, female gym teachers, come on.  Yeah.  That's another one.  I was a good fact to the patient.  All right, girls, we're going to do the balance beam.  I'm going to spot you from beneath the beam.  It's pantyless, and you'll be wearing skirts today. 
[01:22:30]  There's nothing wrong with field hockey.  All right.  We should take a break.  Oh, look at the time.  I've got to go.  Where are you going?  Wow, look at you.  What do you got?  I've got to get out there.  What are you, high?  I've got to get to Jersey, man.  Where are you going?  Everyone's going to, man, I got to get away out in Jersey.  Where are you going, man?  I thought you were in this city.  Not anymore, man.  Oh, forget it.  You can't get anywhere in this.  I have a flight.  Next week, I'm late already.  I'm already late.  You missed it.  You can't go anywhere, man. 
[01:23:00]  The last time I was here, I left here.  I think I got home about 9.30.  It's real time.  I met my wife, and I got maybe two miles from the Lincoln Tunnel, and I moved about 20 feet.  And I go, effing!  It's now the effing coming, effing here again!  This place effing sucks!  Honey, I'm really sorry, but why didn't you leave early?  I don't know!  All right, I was having a good time.  Gosh!  I'm stopping of getting something to eat, then I'm leaving. 
[01:23:30]  All right, well, that's what I told you.  We couldn't even get across the house.  You know, let's just get something to eat, man.  All right, let's go.  Go ahead, get something to eat.  Adam Farrar at Governor's all weekend long.  Yeah.  God, how much fun was this?  Long day then!  Adam, I'm going tomorrow night.  Okay.  Not tonight, so put me down.  Whenever you want to come, man.  Tomorrow night.  Cool.  Tomorrow night.  What's that?  Two, two, and then it's Sunday, too?  No, I'm not doing Sunday.  I'm still on Friday, Saturday.  We'll do the early show on Saturday.  Come on! 
[01:24:00]  You call me in there!  All right, but we're not turning the heat on.  Come on out.  Come on out.  We got...  They opened up a new one in Medford.  Do they really?  There's one out east now.  Does he still have the bar...  I didn't because I came late.  Right.  Do the bar area?  Yeah.  Yeah, the front right when you walk in.  The front bar area?  That's the place to hang.  Yeah, that's what you're doing.  Fire if you're back.  That's it.  You can watch all the girls in the Tri-County Flea Market parking lot.  You see those guys?  Hubba hubba.  All those guys at the Buda Spree's concert are now in the Tri-County Flea Market. 
[01:24:30]  That's right.  They're in the parking lot.  You guys going by in Godzilla?  Yeah.  She's with me, man.  Her name's on the side of my Camaro.  Stop looking at her.  You understand me?  No, no, no, no.  This is my bowling alley.  I'll spray paint.  What's your girlfriend's name?  Sharon, what's your name?  Joe?  Joe and Sharon.  I'll put two hearts on the Luos.  T-shirt.  On the license plate frame.  With the chains.  Because nobody can break that relationship.  I have six dollars.  The airbrushed T-shirt. 
[01:25:00]  There you go, man.  That's when all your friends go,  Dick.  Could you write filthy horse sea sucker and put that in a heart,  please?  That was just, that's so long.  They re-ran something.  Did you get that Louie Anderson show?  No.  Remember that thing we did?  Ah, yeah.  Turning tragedy into comedy.  Louie Anderson.  My father used to hit me with a whiskey bottle.  I was all fat and everything.  Now there's these implications that I might be gay,  but who would think a big, fat guy with an overbearing mother, 
[01:25:30]  enabling mother,  and abusive father would end up, you know,  sucking the big piece of man meat?  Louie.  People are always emailing us and saying,  did you see Adam hugging Louie  on that special Comedy Central thing?  Well, he hugged me.  I bet.  You're just his type.  A guy.  I swing both ways, boys and men. 
[01:26:00]  What is it?  Louie?  Oh, no, we did some show about, uh...  Me and you?  Me and Chappelle at some theater in Glendale.  And it was like,  well, I still had that Jeff Conner with the taxi hair.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Jeff Conner with the taxi hair.  Remember that I had that Long Island hair?  That's right, that's right.  That's what you can ask me,  you go,  dude, man,  I left Long Island too,  and I cut the hair.  You said it to me.  First, I called you a dick,  and then I laughed for a week. 
[01:26:30]  And then went right to the ball.  Oh, he's such a dick,  but he's right.  That's a great line.  Well, the owners got to keep each other sane.  Oh, yeah.  They got to keep each other sane.  If you stay there,  you'll get sucked in.  You're out of the same mold.  You do get nuts.  Oh, there's some parts along it  that are like those black holes  that if you stay there,  it's like the 78 back there.  You never leave.  No, you can't get out.  What's the strip bar way out there  where it's just like one chick comes out?  The Brass Monkey?  There was the Brass Monkey.  There was a Club Personal Touch. 
[01:27:00]  The Carousel.  Carousel.  Tender Trap.  Carousel moved.  It did?  Yeah, it's not on Jericho anymore.  The Brass Monkey is pretty far out there.  Yeah, yeah.  I remember that years and years and years.  But there was like two girls.  Yeah.  There was a big Latino woman.  Yeah, a big Latino bike woman.  Like 40 and blonde.  Yeah.  With a scarf.  You ever go to Bird's Place in Ronkonkoma?  No.  That was one place.  It was like bikers all over the place.  And if you looked at the chick wrong,  they would like wrap your head in.  So you would just sit there with your dollar in your hands. 
[01:27:30]  Please don't look at me.  My friend took his dollar and he'd like lick it  and put it on his forehead.  Don't you use your breasts, chick?  This is the way to get your dollars worth.  Come here.  What's your name?  Cheryl?  Come here, Cheryl.  You like basketball?  You want to go bowling out today, Cheryl?  What are we doing?  What are we doing?  What are we doing?  I swear to God.  I swear to God. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  It was one night and he goes.  I can see the scar.  We were the last ones there.  And this chick comes out.  Me and my friend, Phil, we already backed away.  I think it was my bachelor party.  And we're always like, you know,  because you got the bouncer guys.  They're all staring at me.  I mean, I can't even lift his head up.  And he already did the dollar thing on, like,  the chick before that in Argentina or wherever she's been.  And she comes out and he goes,  Hey, what's the most foul, erotic, disgusting, sexual thing you could do for me for a dollar? 
[01:28:30]  I swear to God.  God damn it.  And she smacked him.  Well, they would always, guys would come up to you with all these stories.  Any time you go to the strip club, especially out on Long Island,  you'd sit there.  The girls would dance.  You'd toss them a buck.  Occasionally, they'd put little matches on their nips and light them up.  That's a great trick.  That cost you five. 
[01:29:00]  Your friend would always tell you this story.  No, dude, I know this place where the chicks, like, pick up caddies with their snacks.  It's, like, great, man.  And you go there, it's the same thing.  Yeah, exactly.  I've never seen it.  She's shooting eggs out at the bouncers, and I'm catching them in martini glasses.  They're handing out winning lotto tickets.  They're giving everybody BJs.  They clip them right out.  Slice it.  Let's take it.  And then when you get there, what do you get? 
[01:29:30]  An $8 warm bud that you nursed for three hours.  Because the new chick just came in the door.  I can't leave.  I've got to take it off.  You're just ready to leave.  You nursed that one bud.  It's just, like, spit at the bottom of your glass.  You're like, well, ooh, four hours.  I've got to go.  Oh, look who just walked in the door.  I'll give the new girl a shot.  She smells like soap.  She's clean.  And then there might be the chick that just walked in, or the one that's tending bar. 
[01:30:00]  There's a perfectly good naked chick up there.  But you're looking at the one girl going, I wish she'd take her clothes off.  You're looking at the girl that's dressed.  You're never satisfied with that person.  You're never satisfied with that person.  All right.  We conquered that one.  You lose that one friend in, like, ten minutes.  Comes back.  Yo, man.  Let me get 20.  She's really, really into me.  I know I say that every time.  This chick's really into me, man.  You know, the bachelor parties are the worst, man.  Because they were trying to get the bachelor to do something.  Come on, man.  Look at the way she's looking at her.  You've got to go with her for the guys.  She likes you for you. 
[01:30:30]  It's not the fact we gave her $200.  She likes you as a person.  Nothing's better than watching her dance, too.  And then she'll start dancing to a song and just stop.  Cover up.  Because now she's modest.  Stacy, could you reject this one?  Reject it.  Reject.  Pretend you didn't see my ass yet.  Yeah.  Yeah, then they cover up.  They're all shy.  Like the music stops for some reason.  Then it's back on again, and it's poll time.  And you've got to tell Jim about the rug, the rug act.  Yeah. 
[01:31:00]  A dying heart.  I swear to God.  They don't do this anymore.  Yeah, out on Long Island, you go to the Tender Trap or any of the numerous clubs out there.  You would get the rug act.  They'd put on a slow song, take the, like, quilt off of their bed that they've had since the ninth grade.  We've got tonight.  Who needs tomorrow?  We've got tonight.  Who needs tomorrow?  Let's make it land!  And there she is, just doing the rug act.  She's laying down now on the floor, just spread eagle right in front of you.  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  And that was the rug act.  And you don't see it anymore.  Then they roll over on the stomach.  And we've got tonight.  Yeah!  And you're just like, oh, the lotion.  With the lotion.  The lotion.  Then the lotion comes out.  And she's, like, doing things, arching the back.  And the best thing was to get next to the guy that was spending all the bucks.  With the money, right?  Because you're honing in on his view.  Yeah, we used to call that the pilot fish.  There was the shark and then a little pilot fish. 
[01:32:00]  The pilot fish.  Yeah.  It would swim alongside.  Come on over.  Anthony's pilot fish.  Scavenger.  Yeah.  Oh, here it is.  Yeah.  She'd take her little blank.  Oh, look at her.  And she's pointing that thing right at me.  She likes me.  That's a comfort.  There's one angry guy at the bar.  I know you're going to have to pay attention.  And then there's the regulars in there.  There's the guy in the suit.  He just came from work.  The old guy.  The one black guy in the whole white bar. 
[01:32:30]  With the white chicks and everything.  And the naive guy.  Who will just keep pumping bucks out, thinking he's going to get lucky.  I tried it last week, man.  She's dancing.  Whatever.  I'm just saying.  And then she'd do all those moves that she thinks are dancing.  You know?  Like rolling around and getting the little leg shuffle thing.  Yeah, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Her feet are stuck on.  Yeah, yeah.  That's interesting. 
[01:33:00]  I showed that last week.  That one.  There goes.  The leg goes up.  And then all of a sudden, they're on their side.  They're on their side.  It's the split.  They try to point their leg so that the little fat on their ass doesn't show.  They point the leg and, like, close everything up.  That's all.  I've been so.  I've been so.  All of my.  Yeah.  Show me some meat cartons.  You got cottage cheese on your ass. 
[01:33:30]  What's that, a golf ball?  Hey, I paid to get in here.  So, what's your phone?  Get your hands off.  I'm drinking.  I'm drinking.  Do I have a beer?  Yes.  Oh.  They would do that every two seconds.  You need a beer?  You want a beer?  You want a beer?  You want a beer?  You want a beer?  Oh, my God.  I just drank this one ounce of beer that I spent eight bucks on.  $1,400.  Oh, wow.  You have to dance come out.  Buy me a drink.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  You want to impress me?  Why did you top dance?  No, that's dancing.  All right.  Why don't you do that, high-heeled whore? 
[01:34:00]  Can you fart, Angie Joodle?  No.  Why don't you stay?  Yeah.  Yeah, your nipples are crooked.  Looks like gravy stains.  All right.  What are we doing?  We're going to get Adam out of here?  Yeah.  All right, pal.  All right, champ.  Brewer, are you leaving us, too?  I'll hang out for a little bit.  Yeah, you get sucked in, man. 
[01:34:30]  I love it.  You didn't try.  I was listening.  You didn't try.  What was that?  Adam left.  Adam had no problem leaving.  You sit there and you're like, can you stay?  We've got to get some pot smokers online.  Maybe we'll play some Stoner Spelling.  That was the day I knew we all bonded because you stopped by for a quick five-minute visit.  You were here for three hours.  That's what I said, Ed.  You know, I think the guy likes us in the show.  It's the whole Long Island thing. 
[01:35:00]  I remember.  You know, we're all from the same friggin' mold.  We all did the same things in different towns.  But we made it out.  Yeah, somehow.  Oh, man.  Huntington, 88.  I was there.  Oh, he's still there.  Not real.  Come on, man.  Come on.  Spooning upstairs.  You're the last in life. 
[01:35:30]  Dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang.  That's Ansel Cock.  He moved out, well, it's been a while now, four or five months.  And asked never to return.  Come on, man.  I like that.  Can these two radio hosts?  Wait, where's the, remember the once you, every Long Islander once checks out Amityville  House?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That was.  That was a bad event.  You just standing there, man.  You feel it?  Dude, I totally believe it.  Look at those windows are evil, man. 
[01:36:00]  They're like little pie-shaped things.  One time.  Dude, I see an eye, man.  You know, everyone, when you drive by the Amityville Horror House, everyone thinks they  see something.  We drove by at night after playing Amityville High School in basketball.  Yeah, that's exactly.  It's a little fight.  You're like, oh, my God, dude, something moved in the top.  Where's that?  Ocean Avenue, I think, down there?  Somewhere, yeah.  They've changed the house, though.  It's not the same.  It doesn't look like the movie.  It doesn't look like the movie.  Yeah, those two windows that look like eyes, they're now like one window.  Oh, that was the whole house.  Who would remodel the goddamn Amityville Horror House? 
[01:36:30]  Here's where we used to keep the spirits.  All right, listen, we've got to take a break.  We're so freaking late now.  Adam, thank you for stopping by.  Good seeing you, bro.  Look, I'm hugging.  Adam Farrar, Adam.  I will.  Plain Governors.  Say hello.  Don't miss the shows.  Two tonight, two tomorrow.  Tomorrow, pal.  I'll catch you tomorrow night.  Really fast.  Vinny, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  All right.  I'm out here on 69th Street.  You guys are causing a massive pileup all over the place.  I live here in Mansfield.  This is the busiest road in here. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, right on.  There's trucks.  Let's look.  Well.  Wonderful.  Yeah, we've got to get Earl to check in.  We're doing a WOW sticker stop.  They're like walking in the van.  They won't come out.  Why?  There's like a crowd of people around his van.  People are banging on the van.  I think Earl's inside.  There's a lot of people there?  Yeah, there's tons of people.  All right, cool.  Earl's checking in.  We're going to talk to him next.  All right.  Thank you, Vinny.  Yeah, we're doing a WOW sticker stop.  RC Edge, Maximum Power, Cole, helping us out.  We are at the 69th Street Beer Distributor, corner of 69th and Grand Avenue in Maspeth, 
[01:37:30]  Queens.  Talking too fast here.  We've got the WOW stickers.  We've got posters of The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Edge, and China.  Some of them are autographed.  We also have WWF tickets, Anthony.  Cole, Matt.  Let's check in really fast with Matt before we take a break, all right?  Uh, Matt.  What's going on, man?  We're at the 69th Street Beer Distributor. 
[01:38:00]  Wow.  We're absolutely seeing here traffic.  Every construction trip.  All right, listen.  All right, listen, listen, listen.  That phone.  Where did you get that phone, Earl?  I got it from a Negro.  You know, someone get the hint.  We need a phone.  Why are we sending him out day after day with that same piece of crap phone?  Un-effing believable.  Going to bring down my buzz I'm getting from hanging out with my pals. 
[01:38:30]  I know.  All right.  Well, anyway, they're doing it at 69th Street Beer Distributor.  Go say hi and grab a WOW sticker, corner of 69th and Grand Avenue in Maspeth, Queens.  They'll be there for a while, all right?  You've got time to get down there.  Looks like they're throwing a little party, all right?  Cole.  All right, man.  We'll be back with more Jim Brewer in just a bit.  Stay there.  Opie.  You scum.  And Anthony.  Your new name is Dick.  Opie and Anthony.  What changed you into such a demonically bastard?  Oh!  Sick ass. 
[01:39:00]  W.A.W.  We are hanging with Jim Brewer today.  I'm laughing so hard I got flimmed.  I know.  Trip down all of our demented memory lanes, isn't it?  Yeah.  Hi, Anthony.  It's FU Friday.  We want to read one here.  Sue from Jersey.  Yeah.  A big FU goes out to my period.  Whoa.  Cool.  This is pretty funny. 
[01:39:30]  She goes, it's been almost two years since I had sex.  I meet a great guy a few weeks ago, and he's taking me to a place in the Poconos this weekend.  Ah.  You're going to get in the champagne glass?  Why do you have a mirror on top?  I plan to F my brains out all weekend, and I got my period.  Yeah, you're not going there, like, as a business trip or something.  It's been two years for me, and that's all right, man.  Let's just mentally get through it.  It's been two years.  It was two years. 
[01:40:00]  We've all been there, too.  We've all been there, too.  It's like, well, how bad is it?  Is it, like, first day or second day?  Is it, like, near the end?  Well, yeah.  I don't know.  I just want to try it.  All right.  We'll try it.  See, you know.  I just checked.  And there's barely anything there.  Wow.  It's like, all right.  It's Friday.  It's like, all right, let's go.  Well, I've got to go to the bathroom first.  Oh, boy. 
[01:40:30]  Okay.  Check it out.  I told you.  Sorry.  I forgot.  Now, wait a minute.  It was her that went two years without sex?  Yeah.  Wow.  She hasn't had sex in two years.  She's got the period, and she's going to the Poconos.  And he's taking her to the Poconos?  That's like, you're going to have sex.  I mean, where's the spontaneity here?  They're going to the Poconos.  It's one of those rooms with the heart-shaped bed and the champagne glass with the bubbles.  I've got the best room.  And the pool.  And it's just the F Hotel. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  Why else would you go there?  Why would you go there?  $10 suite, we're just going to, like, hang out?  What are you going to do?  You're going to have.  And they haven't yet?  That's kind of an odd first place to screw.  But that's the night when, you know, if he is really taking them there, that's going to be a defining moment in the relationship.  She's either going to go buck wild or, you know.  But he's got to deal with the whole red tide thing.  That's what I'm saying.  This could be a big defining moment for them. 
[01:41:30]  I say he goes for it.  We've all done that, right?  Why not?  Why?  We've all done that.  Yeah.  Whatever.  You know, you don't want it at peak tide.  But.  Wow, we're getting dark.  Come closer to my side.  What line can you possibly cross over?  I'll throw up another one. 
[01:42:00]  Let's see how long it takes you to cross the tide.  Yeah, you're right.  For us, it's normal, though.  We forget sometimes we're on the radio.  I know.  We think we're in a bar just drinking beers and stuff, you know.  It's kind of chat.  Oh, yeah, we're broadcasting this stuff.  It might be a couple of million people, isn't it?  We've got to check in with Earl real fast.  It just hurts.  Earl.  Earl.  You.  All right, Earl, don't yell into the phone.  I'm sorry.  I yelled before.  I just couldn't hear myself.  I know, but when you start screaming, no one can hear you because the phone is really distorted. 
[01:42:30]  I'm sorry, guys.  Remember, proper modulation.  That's right.  All right, so you're at the 69th Street Beer Distributor, corner of 69th and Grand Avenue in Masbeth, Queens.  Yeah, we're giving out laugh stickers, WWF posters.  We're going to give away some tickets a little bit later.  Okay.  And it is a madhouse here.  Queens loves O&A.  Well, don't make anyone yell because the phone screws up when it hears too much noise.  Yeah, but everything's kind of calmed down right now. 
[01:43:00]  Right before, it was just rabid.  Cool.  How long have you guys stayed in there?  We'll probably be here for about another 20, 25 minutes or so.  All right.  Very good.  I mean, the traffic is absolutely just backed up.  Every construction truck has come up and asked for WOW stickers.  There's this huge sewage truck with WOW on the side.  They're like, we need some stickers for all of our trucks.  Well, here's somebody that got a sticker.  Sir, where'd you get your sticker?  I got it from a Negro.  Oh, really?  What?  I got it from a Negro. 
[01:43:30]  You did?  Very good.  All right, Earl.  Some audio of Earl getting trampled by people trying to get stickers.  Oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Come on, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  All right, Earl.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Take care.  Earl doesn't even deal with it anymore.  He's just like, oh, okay.  All right.  Is the abuse over?  Can I leave?  Hey, this lady's getting her ass tattooed in the other studio.  You're getting an ass tat?  Really?  What's your name? 
[01:44:00]  My name is Candy.  Candy.  Two W's on each cheek?  Oh, wow.  You don't look like a Candy.  I don't?  No, no.  I don't know.  You look like a girl that would not be getting a tattoo on her ass.  Let's just put it that way.  That is the perfect way to put it.  Right.  And that's why you're doing it?  Have guys been looking at your ass and saying, hey, this looks like a good place for a...  Not a stick, I'm sure.  I don't know.  A good place for a tattoo.  Really?  And who's the tattoo artist?  That's your kid.  Wait, this is way up. 
[01:44:30]  He was like a game show host.  I'm like E.  Johnny, tell him what you want.  I look like...  Candy looks like an ant.  Yeah, you kind of look like...  You know what I mean?  Like, I come to you for advice.  Candy, man.  And she'd tell you, get a tattoo on your ass.  You need to be crazy.  Get a tattoo on your ass.  Are you going through anything now?  Some kind of a crisis where...  Has there been a recent breakup where you feel you want to unleash some new freedoms and get a tattoo on your ass? 
[01:45:00]  Are you married?  No.  What are you doing?  Divorced.  Okay.  How recently?  Yeah, how recently?  Eight years.  Eight years?  Eight years.  Is he still paying?  Who's the dude behind you?  Yes.  Is he?  Tattoo artists make it hurt.  I got to know.  I got to know that relationship, so what lines I can cross.  Yeah.  Who's the dude?  I was bugging out.  I'm getting hit.  All right.  Is that the boyfriend?  Yeah.  Okay.  Now, how long have you guys been seeing each other? 
[01:45:30]  How long?  Two weeks.  Oh, that's it?  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  Was it your...  He's got some good dope.  He's got some serious dope.  What you need to do is just be free.  Look at that cloud.  Is he a reindeer?  Let's tattoo a reindeer on your ass, can you?  Was it his recommendation?  No.  No.  How long have you wanted a tattoo?  For a while now.  Yeah?  Do you have any other tattoos? 
[01:46:00]  No.  First one.  This will be your first one.  You want it on your ass.  That's right.  Do you have any ideas of what you want?  Oh, yeah.  An angel.  Yeah.  An angel.  We got started already.  Oh, really?  Can we see what's going on down there, right?  What's going on down there, right?  Is she sketching or something?  She brought in the design.  Do you remember the Van Halen 1984 cover?  Yes.  Similar to Angel.  Right.  Okay.  Rock and roll.  Tim, where's your place, and what is it called?  It's Fun City Tattoo, on 124 McDougal Street. 
[01:46:30]  Hey, McDougal Street.  Yeah, next to Alibaba.  That's between Bleak Fair and Westbrook.  Alibaba the guy?  I think it's Alibaba.  I know.  Let me tell you something.  The prophet is coming here next Wednesday, people.  Thank you, Alibaba.  You made a wake up.  In the name of Alibaba, that's me.  If you go down the street, you'll get chicken wings, don't you?  Till Alibaba sets you.  You'll get 20 cents off. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, my God.  Well, can we see what's going on down there?  Yeah, let's see how far we've gotten.  Now, how do you get that design onto her ass?  You make a carbon stencil.  Carbon stencil.  And put that on, and then basically just tracing.  How long have you been doing that tattooing?  For four years.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Wow, look at that.  Okay.  Whoa, you've already gone at it with the gun.  It's like a baby type. 
[01:47:30]  A cherub.  Yeah, okay.  A cherub.  Cherub.  On your ass.  With a cigarette.  With a cigarette.  Smoking a butt.  Can't say anything.  In a bottle of vodka.  Is that what's going on down there?  Is it really?  Let me get a look at that again.  I haven't really seen.  It was his idea.  Let me take a look.  Angel with a cigarette and a bottle of vodka.  Finster smoking a cigar and drinking.  Naughty Finster.  Are you from Bayshore?  It is. 
[01:48:00]  Look at that.  There's a bottle.  Let me see the bottle.  New Jersey?  It's got the bottle and smoking a butt.  Yeah.  It's nice lines out there.  Very nice.  Are you putting an O&A on there, too?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  She's putting an O&A on there.  I know she is.  Forever on her ass.  What about that?  What are you going to do if Ann and I split up, though?  I'm going to have to find somebody named, like, Hubert. 
[01:48:30]  Horace.  And we could just put a...  Horace.  Horace.  All right.  Well, you guys have fun.  It's the Auradol and Anthony show.  Well, thanks for coming in, Candy.  She's getting her ass done in the other studio.  Tattooed.  We're talking about tattoos, of course.  You kind of a wild girl at heart?  Sometimes.  Yeah?  Sometimes?  The boyfriend doesn't look thrilled.  You all right?  Where'd you two meet?  Just hanging, man. 
[01:49:00]  Where'd you two hook up?  I just work.  At work?  What do you do?  You don't have to say where or anything.  Just what kind of work you do.  Health care.  We work in health care.  Meet me around the corner.  Health care.  Just what's the PBA sticker on your back windshield for?  I work in health care.  I swear to God, I'm not a cop, man.  Come on.

Candy, of course, Tim from Fun City Tattoo. 
[01:50:00]  Okay, cool.  In the city.  Be good.  There they go.  Right next to Ollie Bob, if you see me down there, hang out, man.  We'll get a hot dog and we'll just chill.  We have to quickly pick up my brother because he's got this...  Not yet.  He's got this phone that he hooks...  I swear to God, it's this through-the-internet phone and he keeps calling everybody and saying,  this is great.  It's totally free through the internet. 
[01:50:30]  But this is the call.  Okay.  I'm not going to be calling.  You're always fine.  No, I swear to God, I'm not paying the time for this right now.  I'm calling you.  I'm paying the time for my computer right now.  This is going to affect my own game.  Even the people I'm going to pay in the time for an FAT&T.  You want to pick up your road?  Better communication is the first moon flight.  He's been on hold for an hour and 17 minutes.  You're starting to call my base, the Eagle's landing. 
[01:51:00]  And I'm calling for my computer.  I was on hold.  Ed, our listeners get pissed off if they're on hold for 15, 20 minutes.  Anthony's own brother, Joe, has been on hold an hour and 17 minutes.  One hour and 17 minutes on his free phone.  Joe.  Dude.  Joe from Venus.  Can you hear me?  See?  Am I joking?  Is it that fair?  Is it that fair?  Oh, my God. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, girl, girl, girl.  Your heat shield.  We're seeing your heat shield.  It's coming loose.  Leave the retro pack on and it will hold it, John Glenn.  Joe.  Oh, man.  Joe.  This is the lamest phone ever.  Ever, ever, ever.  It's worse than the Sports Illustrated football vote.  There's a delay like we're talking to Sarajevo.  Sarajevo.  I've got an hour and 17 minutes and it has to cost me a dime.  Yeah, obviously.  It's worth every penny.  It's the worst.  Let me mess with the mic volume. 
[01:52:00]  What?  Hold on.  Wow.  Now he's tweaking it.  He's tweaking it.  Did you punch your brother?  Suck my dad.  Now, why would I go to N.P. where I could go down five miles to the next town and get  a 12-pack for $3.99 to push light?  Now, why the hell would I do that?  You're out of your mind.  That's what he's doing.  Joe.  Hello.  Hello. 
[01:52:30]  Joe, over.  Do we have to say over so he knows when to talk?  Breaker, breaker, Joe.  Wait, wait.  He's trying to talk.  Joe.  There he is.  Look at the delay.  Joe.  Is it that bad?  Yeah.  Oh, is it that bad?  If someone on your system is downloading porno, we can't hear you for two minutes.  Let me call you.  I told you.  Dude, I swear to God, I get phone calls at night at home. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, man.  Yeah, Joe.  You won't believe this.  Uncle?  I'm on my computer.  It's a bad thing.  It's a bad thing.  It's a bad thing.  I'm just planning.  It's all in the air.  It's phone calls.com.  And I...  I don't know what it is, and it doesn't...  Hold on, my girlfriend wants to go.  I don't have a cable modem out here in Corum.  Huh, Joe?  They don't have a cable modem out here in Corum.  I believe they don't have a cable modem out in Corum. 
[01:53:30]  So he's using his 56K modem to make phone calls.  That's right.  Pull the can.  The string isn't taut enough.  It laughs a minute later.  Tom Brokaw in Baghdad.  I'll call on the regular phone.  I want to play Stoner Spelling.  You can't play.  It's for people that can't function very well on pot.  You've had much too much experience smoking weed.  All right.  Oh, he's one of those guys. 
[01:54:00]  I just smoked a quarter ounce of at least eight of an ounce of a Michalacan.  A Michalacan?  What's that?  What is that?  Michalacan.  Weed.  Oh, Michalacan?  Is that a...  Joe's always been very picky about his weed.  Like this guy we used to know.  Larry grew his own pot and came over our house with lunch bags.  A little paper brown lunch bag full of pot and handed him out.  And we didn't care.  It was just massive amounts of pot. 
[01:54:30]  Right.  But my brother's like, oh, no, dude.  This is nothing.  I was getting like some Thai weed with the crystals on it that looks like it's been salted  and kosher salt.  And I'm like, oh, sorry.  I'll just smoke eight of these and be just as hot.  I don't care.  Dude, it's free.  We just got to drive to Ohio.  Can I buy your car?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Joe. 
[01:55:00]  Go tweak that system.  I can't play, huh?  No, you're too functional on weed.  We need like some real dopes.  We need some stoners.  That's really funny.  I want to win.  I'll send you a prize.  You, brother, you're so funny.  You're okay, man.  Family and friends of Opie and Anthony cannot play the owner spelling, mate.  All right, man.  I'll give you a call. 
[01:55:30]  Are you going to see Adam tomorrow?  Yeah.  Over.  I hear the storm's real bad.  Over.  Oh, this is a big bear.  I'm going to take the room right now, Dave.  Yes, I'll be a governor.  All right, Joe.  Joseph, my brother Joe, calling from the planet Venus, everybody.  Joseph.  The funny part about that is that he waited an hour and 17 minutes for that.  Oh, he is so excited about that, that it's free.  Just the fact that it's a free phone call that he's calling. 
[01:56:00]  He's like, dude, I could call anywhere.  Watch.  I'm going to call California.  Unbelievable.  How are you?  Can I help you?  Oh, is that the tattoo thing?  Yeah.  I thought it was Joe's phone connection.  The girl's getting her butt tattooed.  Oh, yeah.  There she is.  Well, we can see you through the window there.  That was really weird.  She's getting stuck in the rear right now.  Can they hear us in there? 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  Oh, hi.  Hi.  I wanted to know because we could see you over here.  Hey.  How does your ass feel?  Okay for now.  Yeah.  Is it tingling or anything?  Yeah.  You know what you have to avoid after having that done?  What?  Butt day.  None of that.  Butt day.  Stick to your vagina.  All right. 
[01:57:00]  There's candy getting it in the.  Poofer.  The pooper.  Thank you, Jeff.  The pooper.  All right.  We'll fade her out.  Someone bringing up the most pathetic thing that my brother was doing.  What's that?  Calling for free.  Very excited about the web phone thing that sounds like this.  We have a toll-free number here at the station. 
[01:57:30]  When you call it, you don't pay either.  I called the toll-free number with my free phone, and they actually have to send me money  now.  It's amazing.  I make money with every call.  Well, do you want to play Stoner Spelling?  Maybe we've got like 50 people that want to play.  Who wouldn't?  Brewer, you want to play a little bit?  Sure.  Let's do that.  Are you sure?  I haven't got paged yet.  Oh, so you're.  I'm waiting to see.  I left a message.  Hey, we're cool for hanging out.  All right.  So you did everything right. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  You called her.  You played by the rules.  I'm playing by the rules.  I'm waiting for the.  Doesn't matter, bro.  Doesn't matter.  She's watching.  She'll get you back later.  Brewer, it doesn't matter.  Play by the rules.  The rules change.  The rules change.  They'll change on you.  I thought I played by the rules.  No.  No, you didn't.  You ever see those movies where you make a deal with the devil, and you make sure every  detail's hammered out so it doesn't screw you?  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden you get what you want, but, oh my God, I forgot that.  And you get screwed?  Yeah.  That's what it's like.  Oh, yeah.  That's what it's like.  Well, it's tough now because it's a baby, so when you have a baby, man, and you leave 
[01:58:30]  the baby with the other person for more than three hours, you got that face like, you  will never leave me alone.  This child has shoved everything in its mouth for the last eight hours.  I couldn't clap.  I couldn't shower.  I couldn't even fart.  Well, you had a nice time.  Aren't you happy?  How's the little chick with the tattoo in her ass? 
[01:59:00]  Put your child to bed, Mr. Responsibility.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, man.  Wow.  It must be.  Yeah, it's...  Ah.  Baby, I'm sorry.  Wow.  That'll help.  And you know she's listening.  She's listening to Yes Session Cracking.  Oh, my God.  How are you getting here to talk about Reagan and his liver specialization? 
[01:59:30]  Hello, Nancy.  Something about the head.  She goes, what was it?  Ask him what the big head was.  Oh, the Pez dispenser.  My wife, Nancy, has a huge head.  I wake up every morning and, well, I have to stare into the heartless eyes of a goddamn  Mardi Gras float.  That big, big Nancy head.  The Mardi Gras float.  It looks like a big REMAX balloon floating over my bed. 
[02:00:00]  Yes.  I gotta chill out.  Nancy.  Don't have a hemorrhage.  It's okay.  See, sometimes it feels like your head's gonna explode.  Yeah, right, Jim.  Oh, man.  Did he just do a brain freeze or something?  God, no.  I'm just laughing too hard.  Sometimes it hurts.  It does.  I go home tired from just laughing.  I'm sweating.  I've had swamps since I've been here.  Oh.  My ass.  My ass.  Everyone's gonna have to scrub their asses before they see their significant other. 
[02:00:30]  I'll play it.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Did I hear a pager?  Let me check it.  All right.  You got a page?  We'll be right back.  There's the bell.  There's the bell.  It's over.  It's over.  It's over.  I don't think it is, though.  Hello, Jim.  I'm making this call for free.  I'm using the computer.  I'm not answering.  I'm using my Commodore 64.  All right.  Wait. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Well, go check and see if you can stay.  Yeah.  We'll go check it out.  We'll hold down the fort.  We got a ton of stoners standing by to play stoner spelling bee.  Opie Anthony.  We hate each other.  The guy's insane.  He's certifiably insane.  Thank you, Anthony.  Shut up, you jackass.  Opie and Anthony.  Two ignorant jackasses who someone was brain-dead enough to give a radio chill to.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  All right.  We just found out Jim Brewer's free.  He's free.  He can hang.  He can hang.  We just found that out. 
[02:01:30]  I can hang.  All right.  Now, we've got to talk about Stacker 2, Anthony, the world's strongest fat burner.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You've got to lose the weight.  Nice weather right around the corner.  You're going to be all...  Brewer's just grabbing.  He's grabbing his belly right now.  Out there, Hammond.  How do I get rid of this?  Stacker 2.  Jesus.

Still lose weight.  No midday cravings.  And like I said, boost energy during the day.  Stacker 2.  It works.  What does it say?  Banana hammock season is almost here.  Yes.  Remember that?  So if you're going to be wearing your banana hammock, your Speedos, nothing better than going

Who wants to see that?  You ever see that?  It's disgusting.  It's the big fat guys.  Remember when you first got like an issue of Nudist magazine?  Or when the web, when you first started getting into the web, it's like, oh, Nudist.  So you'll check out the nude people playing volleyball on the beach? 
[02:03:00]  Bunch of fat slobs.  Dude.  Where's the hot chicks?  Was it Jones Beach that like years ago?  I don't know where it was.  You know, I think I was living in Florida.  There was one section that was a nude beach.  Robert Bowles is field five.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Yes.  I must have walked about two hours.  It's a burn.  The crap.  To find the Nudist Beach, right?  I never saw one thing.  That was the most annoying.  I was fried for a week and a half.  And I came back with one of them little crab. 
[02:03:30]  Horseshoe crab?  A horseshoe crab.  I come back with something.  I got a horseshoe crab.  All right.  So if you're going to be on the nude beach this summer, get some stackers in.

[02:04:00]  It's FU Friday.  Hanging out with Jim Brewer today.  Having lots and lots of fun.  We're all checking out Britney Spears on TV.  There we are.  Right there.  All right.  I want to say hi to everyone that's listening to us all over the country illegally.  Yeah.  Take your shirt off, Hammer.  All right. 
[02:04:30]  Well, we got a lot of high people that want to play stoner spelling.  Let's do it.  This is Jim Brewer's game.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to find some really good people, though.  Yeah.  Last time it was some funny people.  Yeah.  We need some real stoners.  Dave.  Yo, what's up?  Hey, Dave.  Hey, where are you from?  Brewer!  What's up, man?  Where are you from, Dave?  Yo, I'm from Westchester.  Yeah?  I got a question for you guys.  Yeah.  If I smoked weed, I smoked two joints, and I took two perks because I got the pins taken 
[02:05:00]  out of my ankle, and I took stack or two, is that bad?  Oh, my God.  What language are you talking?  You might be a perfect contestant.  How high are you, man?  You want to know?  Well, yeah.  I smoked two joints.  Yeah.  I popped two Percocets, and I took a stack or two.  I don't know what that means.  What is that?  Well, that'll take the edge off.  Yeah, it's like mixed, whatever.  Here's a good one.  All right.  Well, we have to give the thumbs up or the thumbs down. 
[02:05:30]  I'm going to have to say thumbs down, man, because of the Percocets stuff.  Yeah, it's stoner spelling bee.  Dude, I'm stoned, too.  You see, the thing is, I would probably be able to pass everything if I was just stoned.  Yeah.  But the Percocets kind of even everything out.  How old a guy are you?  I'm 18.  Yeah, I don't think so.  All right, Dave.  We're going to have to pass on you.  One more thing.  Could you just do one thing for me?  Yeah.  Could you play the Timmy thing?

Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine statement.

[02:17:00]  Opie and after me.  1027-WMW.  All right.  It's F.U.  Friday on the O&A show.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  But we're going to play Stoner Spelling Bay.  Yeah.  I guess Amy, who's getting the tattoo on her ass in the other studio, she's in a lot of pain right now.  Is she?  Amy, could you hear us?  Candy.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Candy.  Sorry, Candy.  Candy, can you hear me?  Candy, can you hear me?  There'll be no more. 
[02:17:30]  The producer, what's his name?  He wants me to hurt her more.  He keeps running in here.  That's Rick.  Yeah, Rick's always trying to hurt her.  You do a fine job.  Is it bloody enough for him?  You do the fine job that you're doing.  She's got a bloody ass?  I mean, I'm doing this.  That's a...  Wait, wait.  Before they dump out, that's because of the tattooing, of course.  Yes, yes.  Her buttocks.  Her buttocks is bleeding because of the tattoo.  So, she wants me to really stick it to her.  What's the boyfriend's name over there? 
[02:18:00]  Jeff.  Hey, Jeff.  Hey, how you doing?  Do you usually, you know, pound on the back door?  Have you guys in your two-week relationship gotten that far yet?  Not yet.  Not yet?  Are you hoping to get some butt sex?  Oh, yeah.  Now she's...  Yeah, now it's going to be a little rough, but once it gets better, she's going to want  to show that to you all the time.  So, she's going to be pointing that at you. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, yeah.  You know, in the boudoir.  No butt to boudoir.  Yeah.  So, you might get that butt sex.  Hey, you ever had the butt sex?  Whatever your name is, Amy?  Candy.  Candy.  Candy.  Amy's her real name.  So, uh...  Candy?  Yes.  Have you ever had that?  Have what?  Butt sex.  No.  Butt sex.  No?  No.  You're willing to give it a try for your new boyfriend?  Let me think about it.  You're going to give up the balloon knot or what? 
[02:19:00]  The balloon knot.  I love it.  Oh, man.  Give it up.  Give it up.  Give it up.  Give it up.  Give it up.  Hey, I probably made Jim Brewer laugh.  That's great.  It only took five appearances.  Give it up.  Yeah, that has to hurt. 
[02:19:30]  Wow.  There she goes.  I've broken a record by busting my ass.  The balloon knot.  We've been using that term on the show for a while now.  Boy, if that isn't the most descriptive thing, right?  Come on.  It's the balloon knot.  Who has not stared into the balloon knot?  We got the contestants on hold for stoner spelling bee.  But we were bringing up another memory during commercials.  It's so great to hang out with another guy that's from Long Island, man.  I'm sure they were doing this in Jersey and everywhere else as well. 
[02:20:00]  If you live in the suburbs.  We were talking about pee-pee coming.  Oh, my gosh.  I swear to God.  I was hanging out with him.  And, you know, we already did the whole...  He had the big spotlight.  And he starts jumping in all these fences.  And I don't know if we're going to be sneaking beers.  But we finally get this one house.  I have no clue where we are.  He's in the back.  And all of a sudden, he's like, okay.  She comes.  She starts dressing around seven.  He's checking out girls' windows. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, man.  We all...  Dude, we used to find out where the hottest girl from high school lived.  And we would camp out.  We never saw anything.  But just the chance of seeing something was good enough.  It's order.  I got to look out.  Oh, man.  You better look out the window.  Hey, who's that?  Who's out there, you damn kid?  Look at that machine gun set up.  Yeah.  In mine.  It'll look like a bunker.  In between pool hopping, you would try to see something.  Yeah, we'd go pool hopping.  We'd do that.  You'd jump in the neighbors and all around the neighborhood, the yards. 
[02:21:00]  Pray they didn't have a dog.  Yeah.  Woo, woo, woo.  I told you it was a bit, man.  The dog was on your ass.  It was not a big.  You're a jumping faggot.  I can tell I'm wet.  And the bun run.  The bun run?  Everyone went on the bun run.  What's that?  That's where they would leave the bread and various pastries out in front of the grocery stores  and delis very early in the morning.  Like the bread company.  And they put the big blue trays, the racks, in front of the restaurants. 
[02:21:30]  And you'd go around.  If you went to the perfect time, you would take these, load them in your cars, eat them,  and throw them at other vehicles.  The bun run.  This is how retarded we were.  We'd go to A&P in Valley Stream.  What a bunch of jackass.  We'd sit there.  And I think the one guy's girlfriend was screwing around or something horrible.  So we went there and we bought raw chicken wings.  And we're like, we're going to throw it at his house.  Chicken wings. 
[02:22:00]  And then we would throw the chicken wings.  That's retarded.  I know.  That's what I said.  So then we'd drive around with this whole bag of chicken wings.  And we'd just throw it at people.  Look out!  What the hell is wrong with these jackets?  A girlfriend's parents.  A girlfriend must be like, oh my God, what does this mean?  There's no kind of voodoo.  We got sacks of voodoo.  Sacks of voodoo.  Sacks of potatoes that we'd throw at them.  Chicken wings.  And they're raw. 
[02:22:30]  We would just throw it at people.  Then we'd see a few from other town like, get out of our town, fairy.  Throw some chicken wings.  Throw chicken wings.  Well, the town's half tough.  They'd throw chicken wings at them.  Scream at the mansion.  Hurry up.  Give me the chicken wings.  Scream at the mansion.  What's up, dick?  Take that.  Chicken wings.  Turn down Schwablu.  Dude, I totally nailed that guy with the chicken wings.  Did you see his face? 
[02:23:00]  Did you see his face?  Did you see his face?  That's all I'm going to like.  Did you see his face, man?  He was freaked out, man.  But he realized it was a chicken wing.  I thought I was going to pinch myself.  Swear to God, dude.  And then after we did that, we turned out like two blocks and we ran out of gas.  We had to push and we were waiting any second for someone to come back.  Someone's going to kick our ass.  Did you see his chicken wings?  Swear to God. 
[02:23:30]  Chicken wings.  That's retarded.  I love it.  I love it.  Oh, God.  All right.  Let's see.  You're killing me, man.  Let's see if this girl, Amy, wants to play stoner spelling bee.  Amy.  Amy.  Yeah.  Hey, Amy.  Hi, guys.  Amy.  Are you sufficiently stoned?  Yeah.  Yeah, you are.  Where are you calling from?  New Jersey.  What part?  Ordo.  All right.  Should we pick an easy one?  Wait, wait, wait. 
[02:24:00]  Amy?  You all right?  Yeah.  Are you okay over there?  How long have you been talking?  What time is it?  Wow, you are burnt, man.  Quarter to six.  All right, cool.  You're in, okay?  All right.  All right.  We're going to get back to you in a minute.  Actually, we could even just start with Amy.  Yeah.  Let's go.  Yeah, we'll do the little meet and greet.  Yeah.  And then we'll give them the word.  Have we met and gret her?  No, Amy, what do you do when you're not smoking weed?  Tell us a little bit about yourself, Amy.  Who wants to be a stoner? 
[02:24:30]  Me.  You're in the hot seat.  The pot seat.  Regis Philbin, you're in the pot seat.  She wants some chicken wings.  You made her hungry with that story.  Is that your final joint?  No.  Hello, Amy.  Yes.  What do you do?  What do I do?  Yeah.  I do a help desk.  What?  You do what?  How's that?  Software and hardware support.  Software and hardware support.  On the phone, yeah.  On the phone.  That's the worst thing.  All right, Amy.  All right.  All right.  This interview is going nowhere. 
[02:25:00]  Let's get right to the words.  I'm going to tease all our listeners.  Popcorn.  Want me to spell that?  Buttered popcorn.  No, no, no.  Doritos.  Doritos.  Doritos.  Doritos.  Doritos.  Some melted cheese on it.  Velveeta cheese.  Oh, my God.  How about just chips and salsa in your stomach?  I'm so hungry.  Right?  Some s'mores, man.  Pop-tarts.  Pop-tarts.  I had pop-tarts this morning.  Oreo.  Oh, man.  I could go through it.  You're killing me. 
[02:25:30]  Oreo.  You're giving me a Susan Q's?  Oh, my God.  I'm shoving old lady down a flight of stairs with Susan Q's.  I'm going to eat a Susan Q. I swear to God, I'd hear my pancreas yelling.  How am I supposed to make enough insulin?  That was like those hostess, those hostess, what the hell?  I don't even know what they were called.  Just call us a hostess sugar rush.  The hostess with the cream.  Yeah.  It was like a cake with the cream in the middle.  They wouldn't even refine it to the point of cream. 
[02:26:00]  It would still be crunchy with sugar.  No, screw it.  Send them out like that.  The kids will love them.  I loved Susan Q's.  Susan Q's.  All right, Amy.  Yeah.  It's kind of placed on her spelling bee.  What?  All right.  Yeah.  Jim's going to give you a word.  You've got to spell it, okay?  All right.  Now, what are we playing?  Are we playing two strikes and you're out today?  Two strikes, gone.  No, two strikes.  That'll take too long.  Japanese rules.  All right, Amy.  Ready?  All right.  Circulation.  Ooh.  Circulation.  C-I-R-C-U-L-A-T-I-O-N-T. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, yeah.  Got it?  Correct.  Very good, Amy.  All right.  All right.  Right on.  Hold on, okay?  I'm just going to keep smoking.  Yeah, do that.  Do that.  All right.  All right.  Very good.  Let's go to Pete.  Hey, Pete.  Yeah, man.  Hey, what do you do when you're not smoking weed?  Um, I don't know, 10 bar.

Getting the gold.  All right.  All right.  H-A-W-A-I-I.  That's it.  That was easy.  Hawaii.  Wow, man.  These guys are good.  Well, the words are going to get harder.  You made it.  Hold on, brother.  All right.  Let's go to Melissa.  Melissa. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  From Fort Lee, New Jersey.  How are you?  I'm all right.  You're nice and stoned.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you do when you're not smoking weed?  I was a fine arts major at Fairleigh Dickinson, but I graduate on Thursday, so.  Wow.  Yeah.  Fairleigh Dickinson.  I have to find a real job.  All right.  Well, Jim Brewer's got a word for you.  Okay.  Caribbean.  Okay.  Caribbean.  Let's see.  C-A-R-I-B-B-E-A-N.  Whoa.  Wow.  Look at it.  We've got to get harder words.

You?  I'm doing all right.  Thanks for asking.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Hey, can I ask you something?  Yeah.  Whoa.  Do you guys ever have threesomes there, like a guy and two girls?  Well, we don't want to see the guy part of that.  Why?  Because, you know, I'd be into that.  Oh, my God. 
[02:29:30]  Scoostone is telling me.  Let's just talk to Amy for the next half hour.  You'd be into that.  You'd be into that, huh?  Yeah.  What?  Do you got a boyfriend?  Uh, no.  No?  So you're looking for both.  Well, I have a guy that probably would.  Probably.  No, he would.  He would.  Yeah.  There's no, like, hey, you want to, you know, join me?  But it'd be everything, right?  What do you mean?  Like, not just, like, pickles or anything?  No, we're talking anal intercourse.  Oh, my God. 
[02:30:00]  And once again, you have helped me.  And once again, you have crossed that flock.  Come with me.  Honey, I'll be home for dinner.  All right, Amy, hold on.  We forgot about Adam.  Brewer.  Hold on.  Adam.  Wait a minute.  What?  Brewer just, with his foot, turned up my headphones to ear-pleated level.  Oh, my God.  I felt like I was at Black Sabbath in 79.  My ears were bleeding.  Fucking bugging Adam. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, my God.  It got so loud.  And had cartoon eyes for a second.  Like when Fred has that horn that goes off in his ear.  Whoa!  And the drum comes out the other side.  Whoa!  All right.  Adam.  Yo, guys, I'm in trouble.  I dropped my bong on the couch.  You dropped your bong on the couch?  Bong water on the couch.  Bong water on the couch.  That hurts.  All right.

You're still in the contest.  Hold on to the line. 
[02:31:30]  All right.  Remember that Pac-Man?  Miss Pac-Man.  It's the best.  All right.  Amy.  Yeah.  We're back to Amy, who wants a threesome.  Yeah.  Hey.  Me.  Try it.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  What do you look like?  I'm Spanish.  Long, brown, curly hair, brown eyes.  Where?  All the right places, I guess.  All right. 
[02:32:00]  Right on.  Chick is never going to sit.  Well, you know, I'm about three and a half bills.  What?  I've got some hair in my nipples.  Well, I'm crazy.  What do you say?  No, no.  No, no, no.  I'm not talking about you, hon.  I'm just saying.  No matter what.  Yeah, what chick's going to say that?  I've got a couple rolls.  I grab my fat and I squeeze them together by the belly button looking like another vagina.  But I think you've got to swing it to it.  That's scary.  I can make an ass out of the side of my roll here.  Here, watch. 
[02:32:30]  Seriously.  Hey, you never hear that.  No.  I know she's not going to say that.  You don't hear, I got back boobs, you know.  I bald from, like, my forehead to back boobs.  I'm having a problem with hair falling out.  All right, Amy, you ready?  Oh, my.  I have tuberculosis.  But I'm really a party girl.  I've got little fingers and I smell like rectum, but everything's great.  I'm a party girl.  All right, Amy, you all right?  Yeah.  All right, right on.  Ant's got a word for you.  Okay.  Oh, I do. 
[02:33:00]  Hey, look, I'm the stone one.  I know when to knock her out.  Your word is rhinoceros.  Yeah.  Rhinoceros.  R-H-I-R-H.  R-H.  You guys.  All right.  No, don't look it up.  Come on.  Come on.  I'm not looking at anything.  Time's ticking.  Time's ticking.  You only got a few seconds there.  R-H-I-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-O 
[02:33:30]  Oh, so close.  Oh, the plate, the plate, and the slide.  Can I have another can? 
[02:34:00]  She's out.  He got her.  You only gave me one can.  He got her.  He got her.  You just got the one wrong.  Yeah, you're still in, but you got one wrong.  No, you're still in the contest.  Still in, but you were so close.  Of course, it's R.O.S. at the end there.  Hold on, you're still in.  You just got one wrong.  Oh, her?  Yeah.  Oh, she was so close.  So close.  All right, let's go.  Let's go to P.P., what's up?  Yeah, man, can I take a bong head to prep?  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  All right, yeah. 
[02:34:30]  There it is.  See, that or him sitting down peeing.  We'll leave you this Sunday morning with the sounds of a bong head.  We don't often leave you with the sounds of a bong head on a Sunday morning.  But this Sunday, we thought it would be appropriate to leave you the sounds of a bong head.  Here's me.  Here's your poor church.  Here's me and my bong.  Here's me and my bong taking a big bong head.  All right, Pete.  Jim Brewer's got a word for you here.  All right. 
[02:35:00]  All right, right on.  Schizophrenia.  Oh.  Schizophrenia.  Schizophrenia.  Schizophrenia.  Yeah.  S-C-H-I-P-H-O-R-N-I-A.  Grab on to the ramp.  All right, Pete.  That's okay.  You're still in the contest.  Hold on.  Hold on.  That was a tough one, man.  Should have been, yeah, paying attention in school, not peeing out a second-story boy's room window. 
[02:35:30]  A brewer.  Throwing desks out the window.  Throwing desks out the window.  Putting frogs in front of doors.  All right, Ian.  Yo.  How you feeling, yo?  Good.  I'm about to get disconnected, though, I think.  My battery's dying.  Oh, really?  All right.  It's dying over here.  I'm dying over here.  My battery's dying over here.  All right, Ian.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  Okay?  Okay.  You say what? 
[02:36:00]  To who?  I'm over here.  You're over there now.  Exactly.  I'm very happy for you.  Good for you.  All right.  Who did you say Jew?  All right, Ian, Ian, Ian.  Your word is thesaurus.  He's stoned.  Yeah.  Thesaurus.  Yeah.  T-H-E-R-A-S-A-U-R-U-S.  I can't even do it.  Come on.  That was right, man.  No.  All right.  You got it.  You officially took out the chainsaw and tore up the Englishman. 
[02:36:30]  All right, Ian.  That would be wrong.  Hold on.  All right.  You got one wrong, too.  Marijuana, children.  See what it does to you?  See?  All right, let's go to Melissa.  Melissa is doing some bong hits.  Yo, Melissa, how are you feeling?  Much better.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Ian's got a word for you.  All right.  The word unprecedented.  Oh, God.  The word unprecedented.  All right. 
[02:37:00]  Unprecedented.  U-N-P-R-E-S.  All right.  Hold on.  We have to jump out of you.  Oh, sorry.  You spelled it wrong.  Oh.  There is no bad word for crap in that word.  It's not spelled with an S word.  All right.  Hold on, Melissa.  This guy's getting destroyed this round.  Wow.  Jay Moore's on.  He's laughing.  Jay, Jay.  We got a celebrity guest at halftime. 
[02:37:30]  Hey, Jay.  Literally the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life.  They're out of their minds.  I've been on hold for like 15 minutes.  Playing that spaz that Rick would have put me through.  I was laughing my ass off at the peeping Tom stuff.  Yeah.  How about when you run him through backyards and one of your friends would catch his head  on a clothesline?  Or hit his foot on the sprinkler?  On the sprinkler.  The sprinkler. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, man.  You run him top speed and some guy just catches a clothesline across the eyes.  He gets that wrinkle in his head like David Dinkins used to have.  He's a ruler.  Oh, damn, Jay.  He's a ruler.  You got to give somebody the word chicken wing.  Chicken wing is great, man.  Can you imagine you're getting hit with a chicken wing?  I want you guys to get back to Stone of Spelling Bee because I can't possibly be as funny as you guys want. 
[02:38:30]  Politically Incorrect is on tonight, and I said, okay, terrific, twice.  Oh, awesome.  Cool.  Awesome.  Who was the fourth person on with you?  It was like Coolio.  Coolio?  Was it Coolio?  Yeah.  Oh, that's kind of cool.  Cool.  Whatever.  He's on it every other day.  Jay, is that your first time on there?  No, I've been on twice.  Oh, okay, okay.  I just, like, took over.  At first, I felt like, hey, Jay, maybe you should relax a little.  You're kind of going crazy.  And then I was like, man, screw these people.  I'm selling chicken wings.  This is my show, Hammer. 
[02:39:00]  These people might go to the Bray Improv one day.  I've got to make a good impression.  I went bananas.  Cool.  So you'll like it.  But you can't take it away.  That's the funniest story I've ever heard, bro.  You've got to do that on stage.  Wouldn't you think it would mean something else?  Like, oh my God, someone's putting a spell on me or something?  What kind of witchcraft?  It's so funny, like, just the thought of, like, let's buy chicken wings and found some  other stuff.  I mean, I feel crabbing in Barnegat Bay with chicken wings.  That's right. 
[02:39:30]  That's right.  We go to the dock with the chicken wings.  Put it in a little cage and try to get the crab.  And we went pool hopping one time and they had a clear tarp over the pool.  We all went around.  No way to kill yourself.  It was awful.  It was like we all, like, just, like, hitting just a surface.  And we all got, like, tangled up and, like, just clear tarp and freaked out.  I swear to God, one time we were at Jones Beach.  It was prom night.  And that same dude that called before, we made the wrong turn towards Jones Beach. 
[02:40:00]  You know, we go through the tobos.  Yeah.  He puts them in reverse.  You know, he's been drinking since, like, Thursday the night before.  And he puts them in reverse and we go about 90 miles an hour backwards.  Through the tobos.  We head to the thing and we jump on the beach.  We start running on the beach.  I swear to God.  I don't know.  I can't remember if we were tripping or whatever.  I swear to God.  No!  And he was suspended in midair.  And we were all bugging out.  And our one friend was tripping on whatever.  He said, God, I'm going to a man. 
[02:40:30]  This is bad.  He got caught.  Jones Beach is like a volleyball mess.  And he came out of my door.  He's been twisting around.  And he was stuck hanging in the air.  Oh, my God.  This is word of God, man.  I think the alien ship is levitating him up from the beach.  He's stuck in a volleyball mess.  Scott.  Scott D, man.  I'd like to be that guy.  Hammer, when are you coming back, man? 
[02:41:00]  We've got to beat Opie and his brothers at wiffleball.  Yeah.  Jay is going to Canada to do some filming.  Yeah, I'm a wiffleball champion.  That's who he's telling me that.  Yeah.  Come on.  We're going to whoop an ass on Opie and his brothers.  Yeah, we've got the teams.  We've got you, Brewer, and Adam Farrar against me and my two brothers.  Oh, forget it, dog.  Brewer's going to slow us down.  Who, me?  Farrar is going to slow us down.  Me and Brewer, that's like Maris and Mantle right there.  Yeah, man.  We are going to destroy it.  What if Brewer hit the wall at Yankee Stadium? 
[02:41:30]  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Brewer lefty, hit the wall at Yankee Stadium on one hop.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Yeah.  You did?  Yeah, he did.  Wow.  With his shot, he was half drunk.  Everyone was up there taking it seriously.  Like, I had a uniform on.  I had, like, chew in my mouth.  Brewer goes up there with, like, a tie-dye shirt and game.  He's like, come on, throw the ball.  He hit, like, the pesky pole on a fly.  And I got a double. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, wow.  And he only got a double out of it.  With his gut.  That's why I had a gut.  Yeah, I had a serious gut, too.  I can see that, though, Jay, in the uniform.  I'm all serious.  My wife took a picture, and you can see as I'm swinging, just my gut hanging over my uniform.  Remember, I was so lazy.  I was like, I'm just going to catch, man.  I don't want to run out there.  Jay was diving.  He was tearing it up.  Jay, very competitive.  Very competitive. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, I'm a little nuts.  All right.  Jay.  No one's going to hit my rising fastball.  It's like, you think I came from Taiwan the way this thing moves?  Tony, why do you guys have a roadie up in Calgary?  Forget syndication.  Just go Canadian.  We'll get Ann Murray, Loverboy, Howie Mandel.  We'll make a timely.  Everybody's looking for the weekend.  Hey, Jay.  Now, would Howie Mandel open for Loverboy, or would Loverboy open for Howie Mandel?  That's a tough decision.  That's a tough one.  I really love that surgical glove on the head bit. 
[02:43:00]  I don't know if you can follow Loverboy with that weekend song, man.  They probably open with it, and then do a medley in the middle, and they close with it.  That weekend song.  Five songs.  Three of them are weekend.  Hey, look at the time.  We've got to get back to Stonewall.  It's the funniest thing I've ever heard.  Jay, man, talk to you soon.  If you're freaking vindicated, I could listen to it.  I know, man.  How annoying is that, being away?  I'm going to sit on hold and rack up my phone.  My phone bill hasn't been this high since I was a kid at my mom's house playing Picks.  Picks, Picks, Picks, Picks, Picks, Picks. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, my God.  I just wanted to bring out the Soners with that record.  Oh, my God.  That's incredible.  All right, Jay Moore, I'm politically incorrect tonight.  Bye, Soners.  And a couple OK Terrifics made it on the air tonight.  Very well.  Check that out.  All right, Jay, check in soon, will you?  I will.  I'll call you from Calgary.  Right on, man.  Cool, Jay Moore.  Love you, Jim.  Be good.  Love you, man.  All right, the Stoners are going to kill us, but we definitely have to take a break.  All right, man.  We'll be back, and we'll finish up Stoners.  Finish up, yeah.  We'll be next.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're never going to amount to anything.  It's awful. 
[02:44:00]  It's awful.  Very, very offensive.  Total description of the airwaves.  I cannot believe that those morons are on the air.  I don't know, Anthony.  I think this is better than that rock block, don't you?  Only half is nausea.  Oh, the crap we are listening to while the commercials play.  I can't talk.  God damn.  I can't even talk now.  Brewer, you're freaking killing me.  God damn.  Brewer's doing his Norm MacDonald impression for us. 
[02:44:30]  Norm MacDonald pitching a bit idea.  The Saturday Night Live bit idea meeting.  He's like, this would come.  Hey.  I got this idea, you know.  I know you won two Oscars, you know.  But, like, you're like this homeless guy, you know.  And, like, you got crap in your pants.  Everyone's like, yeah, he's got crap in his pants.  And, like, you know, you got, hey, you want to buy my paper?  And you got crap out of my pants. 
[02:45:00]  I didn't finish it, but that's what I'm working on.  Like I said, me, Tracy Morgan, are, like, howling with me.  Howling.  And Motley and Sherry, like, this is an idiot.  That's stupid.  You know, one time you got a fight with one of the cast members.  And he goes, him and his other cast member would go at it.  They went at it.  So there's one guy.  And your name's there.  It was Chris, the little guy.  Okay.  And it was in Rolling Stone magazine.  They don't like it. 
[02:45:30]  You know, he said things about him.  So the tension is already out there.  I'm not surprising anyone.  So, Norm, we're doing Twilight Zone.  And Norm is the stack guy.  Imagine if you will.  Which he did very well.  But he never rehearses.  When he rehearses, he's just like, yeah, imagine if you will.  Norm, stop smoking.  Jesus Christ.  I'm just smoking a hell of a million.  Why don't they pay me here?  Jesus.  I didn't want to be in a sketch. 
[02:46:00]  Really?  Leave me alone.  So, Catan is on the, you know, he's doing a thing.  And Catan was busting Norm's yamsack.  Yamsack, yamsack, yamsack.  My God, you don't even sound like him, Norm.  You ain't even going to try?  He's my only sketchman this week.  Jesus.  And usually Norm's just not put up with anyone.  He's like the John Wayne of the cast, man.  I looked up to Norm.  He just didn't care. 
[02:46:30]  Nothing scared him.  So I'd look at Norm.  And Norm, I swear to God, would look at me.  He'd wink at me.  And he'd just kind of point at Chris.  So then we'd do it at dress rehearsal, right?  And in my mind, I'm going, why isn't Norm attacking Catan over here?  So then we'd go to dress rehearsal.  And again, you know, like, two minutes.  Jesus, Norm.  I mean, are you going to even try?  He's not horrible.  You should go in this.  And we had to wear these pig outfits.  Like these pig noses.  It was Pamela Lee. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, I remember that fit.  Catan was all over Pamela Lee.  Like, you know, whatever hot chick she'd be all over.  And I'm like, oh, my God, you're so hot.  You should be beautiful.  Tommy Lee was there.  And so, again, Norm is just looking at him.  He looks at me.  Hey.  The sketch gets picked up.  All right.  So now we go there and like one minute to live air.  And Catan starts up again.  God, Norm, I hope you get this right.  Wow.  Oh, my God. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, man, this is nuts.  And this is behind the scenes stuff.  No one would ever see.  So 30 seconds.  God, Pamela, I mean, 20 seconds.  Hey, Dan, why don't you just admit that you're a flaming homo?  And like, you wouldn't be such an angry little kid.  And I mean, Pamela, the only reason he's hitting on you is impressing us.  Why don't you just say what you really think?  Ten.  Ten.  Ten.  You surprised there.  Three seconds.  And we're going.  Imagine if you did.  I couldn't even give you us reruns. 
[02:48:00]  You will see my shoulders just moving.  I cannot get my line out.  Jay Moore knows what I'm talking about.  Oh, my God.  I got to see that now.  Now I got to see that one.  Dude, I can't even tell you.  Hard.  Those two.  That's hilarious.  Hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  Man, faggot.  Yeah, I just admit it.  I mean, you're all over Pamela Adams.  I mean, Tommy Lee's over there.  I mean, gee, Christ, you ain't trying to impress me.  Wouldn't you feel better about yourself? 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, all right.  I'm gay.  Who cares?  Jesus Christ, just say it.  No, I'm rules, man.  Oh, man.  I can't even tell you.  He's the funniest son of a bitch.  We have to get back to Stoner's back to Stoner's spelling me.  We lost Ian.  We just flat out lost one of our contestants.  Yeah, we don't need him anyway.  Yeah, I'm blaming bad.  All right, so we're gay.  Yeah, yeah, he's gay.  Yeah, yeah.  He's dancing around in a little dresser.  All right, we played the Norm clip when he was on Dennis Miller. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, God, I love that clip.  Talking about gay people, we play it all the freaking time.  Can I tell you?  All right, let's do this, and I'll tell you a quick story.  No, you can tell the story.  We were playing some college, me, him, and Daryl.  Daryl Hammond.  And Daryl was the first.  I go up next, and Norm's the best.  Daryl's got a great, tight act.  You know, he's very appealing.  There's some kids there.  I get up there, and I'm like,  Nah, didn't go for it.  Joe Pesci.  I have a good set, blah, blah, blah.  Norm comes up there. 
[02:49:30]  Jesus, effing, blah, blah, blah.  Now, let me say something.  If you're a gay guy, you're either the ass.  Now, if you're the ass guy, what the hell is that?  I don't want to be the ass guy.  He was getting, like, hurt.  He was getting, like, hurt.  Oh, you're getting up, like, this is horrible.  Dude, I never laughed so hard in my life.  He did this routine about drinking.  He goes, um...  Hey, all these people, they say these things about...  All these lies that destroy alcohol. 
[02:50:00]  How about all the lies that's created?  Here's what the hell's you doing in a bar.  Hey, can you send that lady a bowl of soup on me?  Dude, he is hilarious.  We got the...  Let's do this.  Yeah, but now we have to play the Norm clip.  I love this clip.  This is one of our favorite clips.  We play it all the time.  He doesn't care about offending.  Oh, he's funny. 
[02:50:30]  Here it is.  We just love this one.  Have you ever done anything in your long and storied career  that you consider specifically to be in bad taste?  Did you look back on it?  Maybe at the time you thought it was a good play,  but you look back on it and you think that was in bad taste.  Sometimes, like, in stand-up, I'll do jokes that are...  Like, one time I was doing this thing in San Francisco  and they were all gay people in the audience.  So I figured I'll do it.  In San Francisco?  No.  So I figured I'd do stuff about gay people so that they could relate to it. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, it's warm up.  They love that.  And so I was talking about...  Because I went to this gay pride parade  and I saw him at the release of old men and old ladies  with these signs that said,  We are proud of our gay son.  You know?  And so I was saying,  That's an odd thing to be proud of, you know?  Because it's not an achievement, you know?  It's not like something you work all your life to be gay  or anything like that.  And I just wondered,  I had a hard time believing that 
[02:51:30]  these 50, 60-year-old men are actually bragging.  You know, at work, like,  Hey, Bill, you know, my kid.  Oh, my God, we're proud of him, Johnny.  He graduated from Harvard, you know?  The first in his class, you know what I mean?  And now he's articling over at a law firm and...  Oh, yeah, he loves...  He can't get enough in his mouth, his asses, you know? 
[02:52:00]  I got a picture of the boy here  sucking another man's...  He did the same thing.  We were in the middle of nowhere, like,  Oh, God, he goes...  And he's asking people to leave and he goes,  Hey, let me see you.  Airplane Jones?  Oh, God.  I can...  That does not get old, that club. 
[02:52:30]  No, we played that...  God, it has to be 100 times.  Hey, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like the very first press conference we ever had.  Ever had.  You know, I was all nervous.  The new cast were all into this big thing.  It was like 95, 96.  And the reporters were like,  Hey, Norm and Tim, and Spade was still on.  You got any crazy new stuff that you...  Frat boy stuff that you guys are going to do to the new cast?  And Norm goes, What?  Yeah, we're going to anally rape them.  Jesus Christ, are you people out of your... 
[02:53:00]  In minds?  They up in bands.  What a game.  Yeah, I'm anally raping the new guy.  And I went up to him, I was like,  Yo, man, aren't you...  He goes, Ah, F them.  You'll learn that right away,  that those people are a bunch of gay,  don't care about you.  They just want to know about your miserable life.  Let's get back to story spelling me, finally.  Ah, you're killing me, though.  All right, I love that stuff. 
[02:53:30]  We're getting the one.  We got four contestants left.  All of them have one strike against them.  You get two, and you're out of the game, okay?  Let's go back to Adam.  Adam, how are you?  What's up, O.B.?  Hey.  What's going on?  You sound real stone.  We took about an hour break from this game.  I apologize.  It's all right, I'm all right.  To you guys, it felt like five minutes.  I know, but it's been about an hour.  All right, you ready for your next word?  No, but let's go.  All right, Jim, why don't you throw him a word there?  Hey, before I get this wrong, what do I got to do for some wrestling tickets? 
[02:54:00]  What did he say?  Before I get this wrong.  We're going to give those away next week, I think.  We don't even have any right now.  All right.  All right.  That's cool, man.  All right, Jim's got your word.  Pediatricians.  Oh.  P-E-D.  P-E-D.  I-A-T.  All right, Jim.  Hold on.  I'm writing it down.  No, no.  P-E-D-I-A-T.  What?  P-E-D. 
[02:54:30]  P-E-D-I-A-T.  I don't know.  I don't know, guys.  He's stopping mid-word.  Yep.  I can't even finish because I know it'll sound messed up.  And the talent is thrown in.  Frasier goes down.  Yep.  Down goes Frasier.  Down goes Frasier.  I sound like an ass in front of New York, but it's all right.  That's okay.  We all know.  You were on the right path.  Yeah, that's the whole game, man. 
[02:55:00]  All right, Adam.  We're going to have to say goodbye to you right now.  Are we giving consolation prizes or anything or no?  He quit.  Yeah, we're going to give you something for playing Stoner Spelling Bee.  All right, Adam.  All right, you guys.  How are you doing, Adam?  All right, there he goes, Adam.  Keep your hammer dry.  All right, let's go.  Amy was the one that was really wasted.  Yeah.  Amy.  Amy from Jersey.  How are you, Amy?  Hey.  Hey.  Yo.  For the threesome?  Oh, yeah.  We were talking about your threesome earlier.  Yeah.  If I can't find a guy, how about Jay? 
[02:55:30]  What, Jay Moore?  Jay Moore and you and another girl?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I would be willing to just say, if you were here and Jay was here, you'd get  some action.  We can add another girl.  If a big-ass black porn star could tickle Jay's fancy, come on.  All right, Amy.  Yeah.  You sound really stoned.  You got some munchies? 
[02:56:00]  Chicken wings.  Chicken wings?  She's been listening.  She still wants to tickle them.  Yeah, Jim will deliver them.  Throw them at you.  All right.  Let's go with that.  Are you freaking?  Yeah, it sounded pretty stoned.  Hey, I didn't know we could write it down.  Oh, you're smoking bricks.  No, you can't write it down.  Oh, that's what that guy did.  No, you can't write it down.  Yeah, you can't do that.  Are you ready?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:56:30]  Amy, I want Amy to continue in this contest so your word is dog.  No.  Come on, Amy.  Pull it together.  All right.  Propaganda.  That's what I was looking at.  What?  Propaganda.  What?  Propaganda.  Propaganda.  Wow.  Okay.  Yeah.  P-P-R-O-P-A-G-P-A-G-O. 
[02:57:00]  Oh.  P-P-R-O-P-A-G-A-G-O.  Oh, man.  I learned it from you.  A-N-G-O-P-A-M-P-A-G-O-P-A-G-O-P-A-G-O.  Okay, is it P-A-G-O-P-A-G-O-P-A-G-O-P-A-G-O-P-A-G-O-P-A-G-O-G-O. 
[02:57:30]  Hold on, hold on.  It's one letter away.  One letter away.  Spell propaganda.  Last chance.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Go.  P-R-O-P-O-P-O-J-N propaganda.  No, okay.  P-R-O-P-O-J-A-N propaganda. 
[02:58:00]  P-R-O-P-O-J-A-N propaganda.  Wait, where are you?  Where are you?  She's starting in the middle of the word.  All right.  All right, Amy, last chance.  Okay.  Propaganda.  Go.  Go.  All right.  All right.  Propaganda.  P-R-O-P-A-G-A-N-D-A. 
[02:58:30]  Wow.  I did it?  You did it, Amy.  That was like a song.  I'm sweating.  End of the movie.  Here comes the plate, the plate, the bad news bears.  Part two.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  All right, Amy, we're going to put you on hold.  You're still in the contest.  All right.  It's going to be long.  I'm really sleepy. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, so are we after that.  No, we're going to finish the game.  No more than five, ten minutes to go, okay?  All right.  You're also in the Stoner's Hall of Fame.  You know how, like, Jeopardy brings back the greatest champions?  Yeah.  We're going to bring back Amy.  Tournament of champions.  Yeah, it's going to be the Stoner Spelling Bee Tournament of Champions.  Yeah.  And Amy is definitely qualified for that.  Amy, hold on.  You're still in.  It won't be too long, I promise.  Okay.  I got an idea for a sketch where we all anally rape her when she's done. 
[02:59:30]  All right, Pete, how are you?  Yeah, first of all, I think she was still on the list that went up.  That's all right.  Second of all, I'll be the guy in that three-way.  Yeah.  All right, Pete.  And can you send me some wild stickers for being on hold for so darn long?  Yeah, we'll figure some out.  Pete, from Linden, New Jersey.  Anthony?  Yes.  Give Pete a word here.  We're down to three contestants.  All right.  Your word is...  Let me go to this page. 
[03:00:00]  Vietnamese.  Yeah.  Vietnamese.  Vietnamese.  You can't just say G-O-O-K.  Politically incorrect.  How about G-H-I-N-K?  No, that doesn't work either.  All right.  Vietnamese.  V-I-E-T-N-A-N-E-S-E.  Very good.  That I before E thing is a bitch. 
[03:00:30]  Pete has your life.  Yeah, it is.  But you did it.  All right, Pete, hold on.  Hey, yo, can we play this game, Trippin' next time?  Yeah, I got it.  Trippin'.  And it doesn't matter how it's supposed to be.  Yeah, that's right.  My friend told me not to step in the darkness.  Darkness, darkness, darkness.  All right, hold on, Pete.  Do you ever have those words with the I-E, E-I, and you don't know which way it is, so  you write it, and then you realize it might be wrong, so you switch it, and then, so it's  just a mess that you can't tell what it is, if it's I-E or E-I. 
[03:01:00]  You just scramble the brain.  Yeah, scramble it around so it kind of looks like both.  All right, Melissa from Fort Lee.  Melissa?  Yeah.  How are you?  Good.  Hello.  Hello.  I hear cop cars in the background.  Oh, yeah.  What's going on?  I don't know.  I'm looking out the window.  I live on the 20th floor, so I can see everything, and there's like 16 cars going down the road,  16 cop cars.  She's got paranoid.  I am.  I am.  She's looking out the window.  The phone's ringing.  I'm totally not answering it. 
[03:01:30]  That's them.  If I answer it, they can arrest me.  All right, Melissa, you ready for your next word?  Yeah.  All right.  Jim Broards, to you again.  Apartheid.  What?  Apartheid.  Apartheid.  Oh, man.  All right.  A.  P.  Shoot.  A, P.  A.  Eh. 
[03:02:00]  Don't laugh at me.  I'm trying.  Yeah, Ned.  Come on, Amy.  Melissa, sorry.  Okay, A-P-A-R-T-I-A-D-E.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, no.  That's a tough one.  Melissa.  That is horrible.  Really?  How do you spell it?  A-P-A-R-T-H-E-I-D.  Oh, God.  Shoot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a tough one.  All right, Melissa, we're going to have to say goodbye to you, but thanks for playing Stoner 
[03:02:30]  Spelling Bee.  Hold on the line.  Wait one second.  I've got to tell you something first.  Yeah, go.  I'm moving to Texas next week.  Since I'm graduating college, I'm not going to get to hear you guys.  You have to get syndicated.  Texas?  We're going to try.  Yeah.  Dallas.  Dallas could be a market soon enough.  Well, I live in Houston, so Dallas doesn't do me any good.  All right, we'll try for Houston.  Houston.  Thanks.  All right.  Well, thanks for playing.  Good luck in Texas.  Hold on the line.  We'll give you some stuff that you can take to Texas with you, okay?  Cool.  Thanks.  Melissa, everyone.  Melissa.  There you go.  A lot of cows down there.  Yeah. 
[03:03:00]  All right, we're down to two people.  You can annually raise them.  All right, let's go back to Amy.  Amy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That guy that said I cheated.  Yeah.  What?  Just suck my ass.  Just taking him out.  Right on.  All right.  Your next word is black lung disease. 
[03:03:30]  How about spermicide?  I'm sorry, what?  Spermicide.  Spermicide?  Spermicide.  Yeah.  Spermicide.  Yeah.  S-P-E-R-M-I-C-I-D-E.  Yeah, Amy.  Amy, you're the crowd favorite.  Hold on, all right?  We're going to make this fast now.  We're down to two people. 
[03:04:00]  Pete.  Yeah, man.  If you don't get this next word right, Amy is our stoner spelling bee champion.  We can't let that happen.  Um, why don't you grab a word there?  Okay.  The word is apropos.  What?  Apropos?  That isn't even on the list.  That's what I'm looking for.  Like, wow.  Yeah.  Glenn, I don't care.  That's what I was looking for.  Ap.  The word is apropos.  Apropos.  Are you giving the word?  Oh, man.  Okay. 
[03:04:30]  The word is apropos.  He, he, he.  Oh, man.  It's, uh, no, uh, A-P-R.  A-P-A-O.  Oh.  Oh, that's too bad.  Is that even a real word?  Is that even a real word?  Yes, it is.  That means to an alerace.  Yeah, the chicken wants the two guys, he and me.  Oh, well. 
[03:05:00]  Well, Pete, you came in second place in Stoner Spelling Bee.  Got a mic.  What?  I know this guy's hot here.  It's a nice time, Pete, but, you know, it's time to hit the road, Hammer.  All right, Pete, uh, hold on a line.  We're going to give you some stuff for playing, okay?  All right.  Here goes Pete from Lennon, New Jersey.  That was the, the ace in the whole word that, uh, I just wanted Amy to win.  Yeah, we all like Amy.  Let's go back to Amy. 
[03:05:30]  Amy.  Amy.  Amy.  Amy.  Uh-huh.  Guess what?  What?  You won Stoner Spelling Bee.  Uh-uh.  She just goes, uh-uh.  Cool.  Cool?  Can I have, um, WOW stickers?  And a WOW t-shirt?  Wow stickers, t-shirt, and a threesome, right?  Yeah, man.  All right.  For real?  Yeah.  We'll hook you up.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Yo, it was fun, guys. 
[03:06:00]  All right.  Amy, hold on a line, because we definitely started.  What?  Hold on a line, because we, we definitely want to get our number, because you're coming  back for the tournament, tournament of champions, Stoner Spelling Bee, okay?  Oh, for real?  I can go in there?  Yeah, we'll do it.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Well, that might be a lot.  Well, we can have them, again, here, all stoned.  Yeah, we'll figure something out.  But, Amy, we'll just have you come by, because you're, you're, you sound cool.  I got your own.  All right, Amy.  Any, uh, any, any last, any last thoughts before we let you go, Amy? 
[03:06:30]  Any last thoughts?  Yeah.  I can see the light.  Uh, like what?  Any last thoughts, like what?  Anything you want to say?  You got the whole tri-state area listening.  What do you want to say?  Yeah, you guys rule.  There we go.  All right, hold on the line, okay?  All right.  Oh, my God.  You guys, make sure you get her phone number.  She's playing again.  And there you have it. 
[03:07:00]  Stoner Spilling Day.  Marijuana.  Marijuana.  Hey.  Marijuana.  Marijuana.  Hey, hey, hey.  Marijuana.  Marijuana.  Water, water, water.  Man, you know what?  We're going to let Jim Brewer go.  Yeah, he's got to get out of here.  He's going to be late.  You know when you're watching, like, the Knicks or something, and Sprewell has a really 
[03:07:30]  good game, and they're up by 30, and they take Sprewell out of the game early so he can  get the applause?  Yeah.  That's what I need to do.  That's what Brewer's doing.  We're going to let you leave early so we can acknowledge your performance today on our  radio show.  Jim Brewer, once again, stellar performance.  Hey, where did you shoot me a tattoo on your pooper?  Yeah, where is she?  Yeah, where is Candy that got her ass tattooed today?  She's outside.  Yeah, I shot her. 
[03:08:00]  Hey, Candy.  Hey, slip of the gun and anally raped her.  Did you see the traffic from here?  I don't know.  Traffic's going to blow.  How's your ass?  All right, Tim, why don't you give the plug for your tattoo place again?  You came in and did some fun work.  It's Fun City Tattoo, 124 McDougal Street, and the phone number is 212-674-0754.  Hey, you do penises?  How are you going to have my penis tattoo? 
[03:08:30]  That's our original joke.  Lee Baba, Baba.  Lee Baba.  Candy, let's see Tim's work.  Yeah, let's take a look at that ass.  She's having a hard time sitting down.  Yeah, get over here.  Get over there so we can see her.  Let's get a little look.  A little look, see.  What's the matter?  It hurts?  Does it hurt bad?  Let's take a little look.  Turn on.  Oh, my God.  Paper towel on.  Whoa.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that's pretty nice work, though.  Look, a little OA. 
[03:09:00]  Look, an O and A on her.  There it is.  A little O and A.  That's pretty good work there, guy.  Nice.  That's the angel from the Van Halen cover.  Nice.  And you can't help.  All right.  Hey, that's a little angel flying in your ass.  Oh, my God.  The hell is that?  Hell, you dirty little girl.  Everybody brings a dirty little girl.  All right.  Listen.  Oh, man.  We want to thank Candy for coming in.  We want to thank Tim for tattooing her butt. 
[03:09:30]  Thank you.  Bruce has got to get out of here.  He's going to be, like, totally hung up.  That rocks.  That is...  I'm already screwed.  Tim, you do some nice work.  I'm serious.  Thank you.  Fun City Tattoo.  Let's not forget that.  Yeah, good job.  Jim, once again, thanks for coming by.  There he goes, Jim.  We're always a pleasure.  Carp Blanche to come in here any time you damn well please.  What are you doing?  Whiffle ball.  Whatever.  All right.  We'll hook up.  I've got to stand here right in my backyard.  Hit the house.  It's a home.  Oh, we got that.  Now you've got to hit the roof.  Huge.  Your life gets all pissed off because we've ruined the picture-bound area. 
[03:10:00]  It's all like dirt.  We look like white trash.  I've got to put the back stuff.  You've got the whole thing hooked up.  Oh, yeah.  Every house.  I mean, if you're into whiffle ball, yeah.  Let's do it.  You hit the house, double, second story, triple, roof homer at my place.  Wow.  I've got a great patio.  On the patio is a homer, but it has to go over the top railing.  On the roof is a grand slam.  We have the short porch in right field, too, for the homer. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, I'm a lefty, too.  Yeah, he's a lefty.  Well, hey.  Hit that and they know he raped you.  All right.  Jim Brewer, everyone.  Thanks a lot, Jim.  And we'll finish the show next with a quick game of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony  Show.  212-757-1027.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, doopee.  Wow.  Boo, boo, boo. 
[03:11:00]  More stupidity on the way.  Rub, rub, rub, rub, rub.  1-2-7-WNEW.  Oh, my God.  What a day.  Yeah.  I've never laughed that hard in my life.  I've got to just go on record and say that.  Just sitting here and watching Jim Brewer perform like that, the visuals are twice as funny.  Unfortunately, this is radio, but I think it comes off very funny.  I hope you guys had a good time listening. 
[03:11:30]  We certainly had a lot of fun today.  Brewer, Jay Moore calling in on the phone.  And, of course, my pal Adam Ferrara tonight at Governor's.  Yeah.  Adam at Governor's all weekend.  We'll see you there.  We're going to catch one of the shows.  Two shows tonight.  Two shows tomorrow.  Jay Moore on Politically Incorrect Tonight.  He told us he snuck in a couple OK Terrifics.  OK Terrific.  OK Terrific.  We've got to get out.  Someone's got to tape that so we can get those for us.  And Jim Brewer not plugging anything, just coming in as a friend and having a good time.  We really like when people just come in to hang. 
[03:12:00]  Goddamn, he is fun to hang with.  And that's just hanging out for the show.  We have to go out and have a few beers with that son of a bitch.  That would be scary.  That would be scary.  Hey, Hammer.  Hey, Hammer.  Hey, nice head.  Anthony, remember the strippers from a couple days ago?  Yeah.  Well, Jimmy was hard at work putting some sweepers together.  We had the hidden microphone on the strippers.  Yeah, and we learned that, well, we learned what we always suspected, not a brain in the head. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  Well, Jimmy put some sweepers together.  I want to check them out here on the air.  Here's the first one.  Behind the genius.  Hold on.  This is your special device.  He'll go.  He'll go.  Finger.  Behind the playful dog.  Do you know how many guys wish it to suck their f**k?  Behind the glamour.  We'll leave you with the sounds of a sea in the mouth.  Behind the whore. 
[03:13:00]  With Opie and Anthony.  You'll never look at Gash the same way again.  On 102.7 WNEW.  Wow.  That's pretty good.  You put another one together real fast.  Behind the genius.  Come on, read it.  It's against the law for animals to copulate the public and stand still the world.  What does copulate mean?  Behind the playful talk.  I hate genius.  Behind the glamour.  I just thought I hate f**king right now.  Behind it all, there's Opie and Anthony. 
[03:13:30]  No wonder whenever they find the dead strips, they got their mouth duct tape shut.  Behind the whore.  With Opie and Anthony.  You'll never look at Gash the same way again.  Ah, bravo, Jimmy.  Jimmy works his ass off behind the scenes, putting those things together.  That's funny.  They had no clue they were on the radio.  That's what makes that really, really good.  All right, Anthony, let's play a quick round of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show,  and then we've got to get the hell out of here.  All right, we got a couple on instant feedback.  Jim from Jersey, he learned that my brother Joe can do a mean imitation of Alexander Graham Bell on the first telephone. 
[03:14:00]  Very good.  Pete from Rockland, I learned that what I learned is that I am just stupid.  I am just stupid, sober, cannot spell a word, and chicken wings make great animals.  All right, let's go to the phones.  Mike, real fast, we only have a couple minutes left in the show.  What did you learn today?  Oh, I learned that I'm taking the day off.  Next time I find out Jim Brewer is going to be on your show,  and I'll never look at a chicken wing the same without laughing. 
[03:14:30]  Very good.  Syndication on my ass.  Thank you.  I learned that apropos is a real word, however it is spelled.  What I learned on the ONA show today,  that Brewer is the guy who took a leak out of the building's bathroom window onto Spaz's head.  I learned I never laughed at myself so stupid before.  It's definitely time for a Jim Brewer suite.  Yeah.  All right, let's go to the phones real fast. 
[03:15:00]  Charlie, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, I learned I'm not the only one who used to steal donuts and rolls from in front of 7-Eleven.  Very good, man.  Can I say hi to my daughter?  Yeah, hit it.  Hey, hey, Charlie.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, man.  You rock.  Thank you.  He's on that free phone.  Oh, God.  I'm exhausted.  Yeah.  All right.  There's a ton of people, but we're running out of time.  Jenny, what did you learn on the show today? 
[03:15:30]  Oh, yeah, I learned that, like, you'd think that chicken wings would fly like boring,  but they really just kind of freak people out.  Yeah, very good.  It was a very funny day.  I laughed my ass off.  Thanks.  Yeah, we had a lot of fun.  Thank you.  I was crying on the Belt Park bike.  Cool.  See you.  Thanks, Jenny.  Bye.  Buttnut from Jersey.  Checks in every day.  What I learned today, I thought only Rob Halford could sing the lyrics of Screaming for Vengeance.  God bless Jim Brewer.  Brewer, another amazing performance.  Dave from Chester, New Jersey.  I learned that if you could get a chick to get an ass tattoo, she might consider butt sex. 
[03:16:00]  I learned today, drunk guys at Anthony's Giggs request his baseball cap.  Yes.  Mm-hmm.  Ed, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  I learned that Jay Moore was addicted to the Picks, Picks, Picks, Picks, Picks.  Picks.  Hey, you know what you always forget to talk about?  The tic-tac-toe one.  Yeah.  You never talk about that one.  There was a tic-tac-toe Picks?  That was the first one they ever did.  I just remember the basketball one and like the Pong one. 
[03:16:30]  Right.  Yeah.  And quickly, also, in the cartoons, remember they used to do the commentaries every week  and they used to have the same guy and then at the end you'd say, what's your opinion?  We'd like to know.  We'd like to know.  We'd like to know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why the hell did they show that?  Who the hell can it?  I don't know.  I think it was the law.  Well.  It was a public service thing, sir.  Ed.  During Tom and Jerry?  Ed, no one else.  We'd discuss it for the next hour, but we're running out of time.  Sorry, guys.  Have a great weekend, though.  You too, guys.  Later, man.  Later.  John, what did you learn on the show today?  John.  Hello.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, man.  What's up?  Awesome show. 
[03:17:00]  I learned that if I fart next to my teacher and throw chicken wings at people, that maybe  someday I'll get pussy whipped by my wife to get home on time.  Very good, man.  Bye, precious.  All right, bye.  Precious.  Evan from Jersey.  I learned high people are pretty good spellers.  Yeah.  Luke from Yonkers.  I learned two things.  One, that you could get better reception on the moon than from the Internet.  Two, I actually never, ever, never, ever, ever, ever, ever really learned a freaking  thing.  That's true.  From your show.  All right. 
[03:17:30]  Ah.  I think we're done, man.  Yeah, please.  Huh.  Joe on line 10.  I learned that Adam Farrar takes two days to plug his skates.  That's not true.  He's just in front of Anthony's.  He comes in when he's in town.  We're going to check him out tomorrow.  Yeah, we'll see you at Governor's tomorrow for Adam Farrar.  Yeah, check out Adam.  Hey, guys.  We had a great time this week.  I hope you had fun listening.  What a piece, sir, we had.  Uh, some guy from Glendale. 
[03:18:00]  I learned Jim Brewer sounds more like Norm MacDonald than Norm MacDonald, though.  Yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  He only raped you.  Yeah, doesn't make you gay.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll see you guys Monday.  Yes, we will.  At 2 o'clock.  Have a great weekend.  Mm-hmm.  And Dynamiker next.  I guess we're done, Ann.  Gunski.  All right.  Thank you. </pre>
