<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Jim Norton, engaging in sexually suggestive and offensive banter.  They transition into a discussion about Black Friday and Cyber Monday, sharing anecdotes about their shopping experiences and mocking the uselessness of mall gifts.  Listener calls follow, detailing the frustrations of holiday shopping and the chaos of Black Friday from both shopper and retail employee perspectives.  The conversation touches upon the absurdity of Black Friday sales, the prevalence of gift cards, and the closing of a Tower Records.  A caller recounts buying all his own Christmas presents, and another describes a vibrating saddle from Brookstone.  Jim Norton shares a humorous, albeit negative, account of a recent bed and breakfast stay, focusing on the unusual server and the lack of amenities. The hosts speculate crudely about the server's sexuality.  Other topics briefly discussed include Michael Richards' apology tour, a supposedly "gay" Tom Brady fan song, a picture of Britney Spears' genitals, and the death of the Prius inventor, all prompting further crude humor and offensive remarks from the hosts. The show promotes an upcoming "homeless shopping spree" segment and previews a listener's contribution to Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories.

The show then delves into a lengthy discussion about Anderson Cooper's alleged homosexuality, fueled by a Page Six article, with the hosts using sexually suggestive language to comment on the account. They satirize Neil Patrick Harris' perceived change in speech after coming out.  A significant portion focuses on Michael Richards' racist rant and subsequent apologies, playing audio clips of his apologies and criticizing their sincerity.  The hosts mock the public response, Gloria Allred, and Paul Mooney's seemingly contradictory statement about being "cured" by Richards' experience.  They also discuss an absurd statement by another comedian calling for the extermination of white people and play audio from Richards' interview with Jesse Jackson. Adam Farrar, a comedian promoting his shows, is mentioned as a studio guest.  The hosts also mention their upcoming "Eggnog Challenge" and suggest a humorous YouTube video involving vomiting on an exercise machine in Brookstone.

The next segment begins with the hosts mocking a listener who mistakenly believed the show was being censored by XM, using highly offensive racial and misogynistic slurs.  They pivot to a news story about teenagers having sex in movie theaters, providing sexually explicit jokes and anecdotes.  They discuss a listener email about a 14-year-old girl reporting her friends' sexual activity, using derogatory terms.  Citizen Cope, a musician, is a studio guest, performing "Sideways" and "More Than It Seems."  The hosts' conversation with him is peppered with crude jokes about Jim Norton's girlfriend, his anxieties, and their differing musical tastes.  Following the performance, the conversation returns to listener feedback, including criticism of Norton’s vulnerability during the segment, more sexually explicit banter, and comments on Citizen Cope. They also discuss a news story about Heather Mills, further punctuated by sexually explicit jokes, and again promote the "homeless shopping spree."

A segment heavily features a discussion about Michael Richards' racist rant, with studio guests Patrice O'Neill and Suley McCullough offering their perspectives.  A phone call from Sean Hannity ensues, debating racism and the justification of racial slurs.  Hannity's views are challenged by the hosts and O'Neill.  Other topics include Heather Mills’ account of losing her leg (met with skepticism), Adnan Khashoggi's alleged involvement with a former prostitute, and the hosts' upcoming appearances on *The Tonight Show* and *Late Show*, including a humorous behind-the-scenes anecdote with David Letterman.  The hosts also discuss *Fast Food Nation*, offer a comedic review of the new James Bond film, and mention *The Last King of Scotland*.  Crude humor and offensive language are prevalent throughout.

The final segment opens with the hosts and Roland attempting a humorous rendition of the James Bond theme song, followed by a positive caller comment despite the omission of the film's title, *Casino Royale*.  A Chris Cornell song is discussed, along with Roland's unique renditions of the theme.  A $1,000 video contest is announced, mentioning existing videos, including one with a baby and Jim Norton's face superimposed.  The death of the "Prius guy" is discussed, along with his prior interaction with Steve. Pat from Monaki, a regular caller, teases a big announcement, sparking speculation and sexually suggestive jokes. A news story about Jeffrey Woodcock, a man with half his face paralyzed, is followed by further discussion of Pat and his eggnog drinking contest.  The hosts’ banter includes sexual innuendos, jokes about death, and offensive language, particularly concerning a story about a nun and Negro League baseball players.  The perceived failure of the "Razzle-Dazzle Hour" segment is discussed, with accusations of poor production and lack of content. The hosts joke about using offensive language behind the scenes.  The show concludes with the "Line of the Day" and announcements of upcoming appearances and events, including mention of the Black Horse Killer.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony and James Norton.  A single virus has invaded, multiplied and killed the cell.  Continually multiplying, searching for the next victim so there's nothing left to kill.  The answer to infection.  There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can.  Fills their veins and blood with their pure rage and then eventually everything just stops.  The virus is spreading. 
[00:00:30]  If this doesn't make you want to throw out a failure, the most annoying thing on two legs, what a bore fest, who cares about the funny, just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb, hee hee.  Opie, Opie, do you want to play?  Anthony, I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton, I'm dancing, I'm dancing, I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable, I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Why are you crying? 
[00:01:00]  The virus finally hit him, but with Jimmy, you never know, it could be AIDS.  No.  Yes, yes.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. today.  And...  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Welcome. 
[00:01:30]  Too many days off.  I felt like I was waking up in the middle of the night for the first time in many, many months.  Yeah.  Gotta screw the sleep up real good.  Get back and the mics don't sound right.  I love it.  But they do smell fresh.  As soon as you said that, I smelled my mic. 
[00:02:00]  Lemony fresh.  There's a little bad breath going on with my mic.  Mine is sprayed pretty good.  You can smell it through the spray is what I'm saying.  Oh.  Well, don't get that close.  Ah, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  Write it down.  1-866-313-FREE.  Welcome to Cyber Monday.  Yeah, I heard that.  That little attempt to get us to buy stuff. 
[00:02:30]  That Black Friday, which is, you know, after Thanksgiving.  Black Friday is when everyone goes shopping.  It's supposedly called that because it brings all the stores into the black.  Out of the red, into the black.  Financial terms.  And this year's Black Friday was a huge success.  Was it?  Up 6% from last year.  How come I heard Walmart said sales were down?  Because it's Walmart.  Walmart.  And then they say, well, Cyber Monday starts all your online buying for the holidays. 
[00:03:00]  Well, what's going on is everyone finally gets back to work.  And instead of working today, they're on their computers.  Yeah.  What should I give mom?  I don't know why there's a Black Friday at all.  When you could just go online and buy stuff.  It's so easy.  I actually hit the mall on Friday just as a goof, really.  Oh, my God.  Why did you do that?  As a goof, I went to the mall on Friday. 
[00:03:30]  And there wasn't as many people as in past years.  Really?  Yeah, I'm serious.  What malls you go to?  Walt Whitman?  Yeah, Walt Whitman.  Oh, okay.  That explains it.  Why?  When was the last time you were at Walt Whitman Mall?  Dude, recently enough.  I would say years.  No, recently enough.  What are you getting at?  I'm getting at that is probably one of the most dated malls in the tri-state area.  On Long Island, we're talking.  Yeah.  It's not that bad, actually.  They've upgraded a bit.  Have they? 
[00:04:00]  They really have.  I guarantee you haven't been in that mall, I would guess, in six years.  No, no.  Probably two.  Probably two years.  But there just weren't as many people out.  Because a lot of people are starting to do all their shopping online.  Yeah.  What'd you buy?  It's the only way to go.  I bought stuff for me.  Did you?  You shopped for yourself.  And everyone's asking me, well, what do you need for Christmas?  And all the stuff I told them I need, I bought just dumb stuff like Tiger Woods 07 for the PSP. 
[00:04:30]  I bought Ali G because I never saw it.  And a couple other dumb things.  Presents for yourself and you got no one else anything for Christmas?  Good.  And I'm walking around the mall, I'm like, it's the same crap every year.  Every year.  Maybe this year I'll buy someone the bonsai tree.  Oh, Grandma, you need the isotoner gloves?  Oh, it's just crap.  Should we get Grandma the gloves or the slippers?  If we get Grandma the slippers, then we can get Aunt whatever the gloves.  And, oh, it's just this big confusing mess of who gives a crap. 
[00:05:00]  All the gifts are crap.  You walk around the mall, you can't find a special gift.  No.  I mean, I really want to, I'm holding out that I can find some special stuff for my family and girlfriend and stuff.  It's all crap.  I want to go to that one store where it's like, now this is cool.  This is something unique and different.  Good luck.  Good luck is right.  You're not going to find it.  People don't just like, I was trying to be nice last year and I got my parents his and her coffin pillows.  Silk. 
[00:05:30]  Silk.  So, anyway, it's Cyber Monday, so enjoy that, whatever the F that means.  And then, Anthony pointed out just before the show today, it's also hurricane season is winding down.  Yes, officially ends this week.  Hurricane season.  Thank God.  When?  Friday?  I don't know.  Yeah, they got to pick it by the day.  And hurricanes know when it officially ends.  They know.  They just stop a-blowing.  They know.  And it officially, thank God, officially ends what, at the beginning of the season, what the news won't say. 
[00:06:00]  But why don't we get some of those clips before hurricane season started, how horrid they said this hurricane season was going to be.  Yeah, they pretty much.  The worst one ever.  They pretty much said, if you thought last year's hurricane season was bad, wait for this year.  And they actually.  While we waited, nothing happened.  Nothing.  I remember them saying, also, it's going to be extra bad.  Extra bad.  For people in the northeast, in the northeast. 
[00:06:30]  Like for us.  Northeast?  Yeah.  Meaning New York?  Yeah, New York.  Shut up.  A hurricane hits.  The Jersey Shore.  A hurricane hits every.  Oh, please.  I was going to say 20 years.  Probably 20 years.  No, try 50.  You get a good one.  Try 50.  Yeah.  It's just their fear-mongering.  And every year is going to be the worst one.  And this year, did one even make landfall?  No.  I don't think so.  I feel like they got a little bit of something in Florida once. 
[00:07:00]  Some rain this year.  Maybe.  But nothing.  Just more crap from the news.  So I guess that's exciting, too.  Yeah.  Season ending this week.  Oh, phew.  Squeaked through.  Thank God.  Time to take the plywood down.  Whew.  That was a close one.  I put X's on all my windows with tape.  Now I have to peel it off.  Hey, people are calling me a selfish bastard because I bought all the stuff that other people  were supposed to buy for me.  I didn't want to wait another month to play Tiger Woods 07. 
[00:07:30]  Do you hate that?  People go, what did you get that for?  That's what I was going to get you for Christmas.  Yeah.  I want it now.  Yeah.  Now figure something else out.  Now I'm playing.  I'm having fun.  Let's see how good you really are.  And they're lying, by the way.  Just say you got anything, and they'll say that they're going to get you.  Yeah.  Right.  They don't know what you like.  They really don't care.  So they're just saying anything that you buy, they were going to get you.  Put it on your list.  Online.  Your wish list.  I'm just going to buy myself stuff from now until Christmas to make it really hard for  people.  Just make it impossible. 
[00:08:00]  Make it impossible.  Tell your family you bought tampon applicators.  All right.  It's pretty much the last thing we had for you.  They're calling me a selfish bastard.  I actually did walk around the mall looking for gifts for others, but I wasn't going to  settle for just the basic mall crap.  That's what I'm getting at.  I went into Sharper Image and all those dumb places.  It's all crap.  It's all crap.  It's just that there's nothing in there that you're going to give to somebody that they're 
[00:08:30]  going to go, wow, that's something.  Just tell your family you want stuff that's really expensive.  That would really make them uncomfortable and keep getting to it.  Yeah, I want to come on.  I want my mansion painted.  Let's say hi to Paul in Maine.  New caddy's nice.  Hey, Paul.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You know, talking about Black Friday.  My girlfriend works retail for a big company.  And all it is, it's a holiday for these people that are all grumpy, that want to feel good  about themselves, to buy a cheap gift early in the morning, and they can yell and scream 
[00:09:00]  at each other in the store, get into a fistfight over a stupid little sweater.  That's all it is.  I don't even really understand.  People that enjoy it.  People get up, and they're at the mall by, what, 530 or 5 in the morning, wait in line  until the doors open?  What's that about?  Oh, up here in Maine, there was people that were out there.  They opened up one of the big malls up here in Maine at 1 o'clock in the morning.  Why?  1 o'clock in the morning, so people could go shopping.  Time did it close?  Like 11?  7.30 a.m.?  No. 
[00:09:30]  I mean, I was sleeping.  I watched football all day and ate turkey.  I went to bed.  Yeah, there's no reason to do that.  Yeah, there's no reason.  All they do is yell and scream at each other, and they, you know, I mean, it's ridiculous.  It is a special breed of person.  Yeah.  That does that.  The poor person.  The poor people.  The poor people that want to save 10% on a stupid, lousy sweater from the, I was going  to say The Gap.  I don't even think The Gap falls for Black Friday crap.  Van Heusen does.  My parents go there every year.  There you go.  Van Heusen sweater.  Pukey clothes they get me every year. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  You open the sweater, you can hear the plastic, like the little piece of...  That wax paper inside, you got to pull out, wax paper box.  There are just awful people that like going out and being miserable, because face it, going  to the mall to do holiday shopping is miserable.  It's not fun.  You're online.  You're in crowds of people banging up against smelly people, and there's frenzies at every  little kiosk and little area where the good stuff is, and then you got to stand on this 
[00:10:30]  long line where everyone in front of you doesn't know what money is, or how it's used.  Hi, that's a $59.95.  I've been looking at the bar.  No, that's $50.  I need to buy...  And they're trying to pay in like drachma, or something.  And you sit there and go, what?  Why?  You're actually talking like you're experiencing this.  I did.  You don't experience this anymore.  I did in the past. 
[00:11:00]  I have vivid memories of these awful times.  Yeah, you barely have memories of that.  Yeah, sort of like a dream, I remember.  No, I remember going to the malls.  You're all about gift certificates, and that's about it, I guess.  It's gotten down to...  Gift cards.  ...the past two years.  It's gotten down to nothing but American Express gift cards.  Before that, I gave it a shot.  I tried.  But it's just...  It's...  I go to the mall, and you're like, you just...  I don't know what to get anybody. 
[00:11:30]  Because it is this...  I could get the gloves and the stupid slippers, but I go, you know, this is so stupid.  How many gloves does this old lady need?  Jesus.  Wear them on her head.  How many bathrobes does mom need?  How many friggin' slippers could she use?  How many blow-up dolls can I get for my father?  He tells me that part of this mall isn't crowded.  He's got the whole collection at this point.  And you try to go over and, like, pretend you don't see the photos of your sister with 
[00:12:00]  the head cropped and the coal cut in the mouth.  The one that goes, ah.  You got a mall that goes, oh.  You got a mall that goes, ah.  Every year he's trying to take pictures.  I'm just yawn, hon.  I'm just yawn.  Let's say hi to Dominic on Long Island.  Authentic Greek features.  Hey, Dominic.  What's up?  Oh, Jimmy.  How are ya?  Hey, Ope.  I was thinking about the Sharper Image.  I know they had a lot of cool things in there.  I had walked through the store myself.  I know I'm not quite the fancy, fancy man that you and Ant are, but I... 
[00:12:30]  Well, you know, that's a misconception.  I'm far from fancy.  I'm pretty regular.  I actually should, like, you know, be a little more fancy, but I'm not fancy.  I don't know why.  Well, I liked some of the stuff in there.  I know it might seem crap, but there were some nice things in there.  Like what?  Give me one thing I could get at the Sharper Image.  Off the top of my head, I could probably name none. 
[00:13:00]  I knew it.  You know, but walking through the store, I mean, I had walked through the store and I saw some nice stuff.  I know most of it is probably crap, but I saw some nice stuff in there.  You know, it's cool.  All right.  I'll take another look.  Thank you, Dominic.  You know what I like?  Yeah.  The executive stress reliever.  You know, you put it on your desk and push the buttons and it just yells things out.  It's hysterical.  Oh, I thought you meant the massage thing.  Oh, that too.  The back massage thing.  The back massager you can get there. 
[00:13:30]  It's for the back.  Sure it is.  They show a girl using it on her shoulder blade with her head tipped back, her blonde  hair flowing over her back, her eyes are shut, and she's going, ooh.  Yeah, because that's the first place she would use it on.  Yeah.  The shoulder blade.  Yeah.  We'll buy it.  We'll buy into that.  Wink, wink.  Unless she was disfigured in a horrible accident and some parts ended up elsewhere.  Yeah.  She's not going to be touching her shoulder blade.  She's rear-ended by a truck now.  Her shoulder smells.  Let's go to Jeff in Dallas. 
[00:14:00]  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  These people get up on Black Friday, go to the malls and go to Walmart and stuff.  These are the same people who can't get up before 11 o'clock during the week to make it  to work.  No, they're hungover.  Oh, good point, sir.  Good point.  That's such a tradition.  People get up and shop.  It's stupid, but that's what they do.  It is stupid.  That's one of my devil's advocates.  There's no reason for it.  God bless them having fun. 
[00:14:30]  It's Mitch in New Jersey.  Mitch.  Shut up.  Really?  Mitch.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Mitch.  Yeah, I got to agree with him.  I used to think about all the gifts I would give to people.  Maybe Susie would like this or that.  Then one year, I got four desk calendars and a pair of socks.  Now it's back to nothing.  On Tuesday, I'm going to buy clerks, too.  Right on.  The calendar gift.  All right.  She loves kittens.  Let's get her the one with 12 adorable little kittens in it. 
[00:15:00]  It should be all about the gift cards.  Yeah.  Get it yourself.  Trade gift cards.  Because no one can pick out a gift for you as well as you can.  It just ain't going to happen.  So you give them a good gift card.  They can go and get whatever the hell they want.  There you go.  That's all.  Give them one for Tower Records.  They have to go out and panic.  I got to get something.  The eight items left on the shelf.  This looks like a bomb hit it.  Oh, it's so awful.  There's nothing good left. 
[00:15:30]  You know what?  We should send someone to Tower Records because you make a good point.  We got a Tower Records in our neighborhood.  Jimmy and I live sort of, I don't know, about four blocks away from each other.  And there's a Tower Records closing up there.  And it's one of the massive stores.  And I go in there like once a week.  It's hilarious.  At first, it was just a complete panic and everyone just going nuts.  Now it's like people are still in there.  But you have to dig deep to find anything that's worth buying at this point.  Garbage.  You're getting like the lost Ringo Starr tapes. 
[00:16:00]  It's like the TV DVD section or whatever.  It's like, you know, Alice is left.  Just season three.  Like Maud season 12.  Like it's not even.  Alf with the season, the outtake.  It's just awful.  It says nothing left in there.  I bought a movie called The Aussie Boys.  It was about Australian gang fighting.  I'm like, oh, this is going to be great.  It could be the worst thing I've ever seen.  We'll watch about three minutes and throw it.  All right.  Throw it. 
[00:16:30]  Why don't we take a quick break?  Oh, well, Liz wants to just kiss our butt.  That's always fun.  Liz, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Liz.  Dog house.  What?  I just want to say I love you guys.  Were you just giving a secret message to somebody?  Uh, yeah.  What does it mean?  Send more helium?  Yeah, why does your voice sound like that?  Are you calling from Gulliver's Travels?  Huh?  Oh, is it JV and Elvis, like, shout-out or something? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Cool.  All right.  Also, I just wanted to make a shout-out to my boyfriend, Bobby.  All right, Liz.  Thank you for calling the program today.  Where is he?  Listening to your voice and hanging himself?  Let's go to Eli in Brooklyn.  Eli.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  I agree.  There's a lot of crap in these stores.  I walked into Brookstones, though, and you know the vibrating chair section?  Yeah.  They have this thing there, and I swear to God, it's a vibrating saddle.  Hoo-hoo.  And it has a video there showing women exercising, quote-unquote, on this thing. 
[00:17:30]  And I'm looking in awe.  This black woman comes up next to me.  She goes, I'm going to try that.  She gets on it.  And she gets off and goes, honey, I know what that's for.  That ain't no exercise equivalent.  The best part of the phone call, Eli, goes, I looked at it in awe.  In awe.  Of course you would have to.  Well, the worst part is, you ever go to get on a vibrating chair, like the old lady gets  off it, and you realize it's a regular chair, and she has Parkinson's?  Hey, what's up for mom?  Hey, what store is this?  If she can sit there, and you can just jump on her, because it looks fun.  Hey, what store is this in? 
[00:18:00]  Brookstone?  In Brookstone, yeah.  When is Brookstone open?  We should send one of our stripper friends down there to totally get off in the store  in the middle of the day.  On the vibro-saddle.  Right.  All right, Eli, thank you.  Take care, guys.  Bye.  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  We've got lots to do today.  We've got the Michael Richards apology.  Ooh.  Yes.  Yes, it's very, very good.  He's on his apology tour, and it never ends.  He's not sorry, but he has to make believe he's sorry.  They just showed a video clip of him on a Jesse Jackson show. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Jesse went on there, and oh, my God, did he look uncomfortable.  It was him and three black guys just standing kind of around him, and Jesse, and he's just,  I apologize.  It was an awful thing I did.  It sounds like he's drugged, too.  Yeah, why don't we get into it after the break, because we all got some comments on that.  Also, we'll talk a little football.  And Boston, what's going on, man?  Great win over the Bears.  Sorry, Chicago.  We're in Chicago as well.  Well, but there's a song out called Brady that's, it's a little gay. 
[00:19:00]  Is it?  It's a little gay.  Just some guy, not just some guy professing his love for the sport?  Well, we'll play it after the break, and then you decide if it's a little gay.  Is the team endorsing it like the Yankees did with that stupid song?  No, it's not.  No, no, no, no, no.  It's a YouTube phenomenon.  It's another thing we found off YouTube.  Not written by Anderson Cooper, is it?  Well, speaking of gay, we got that, too.  That is really funny.  We'll do our gay break next. 
[00:19:30]  How's that?  Good.  Exciting.  Because then we got Brittany and Paris Hilton hanging out together.  Yeah, Brittany's trying.  And there's a Brittany snatch shot.  Oh, good luck getting that through.  Why?  I don't think it will go.  No?  First dump of the day.  Oh, well.  Well, we'll talk about Brittany and her you-know-what.  They got a picture of it.  Her change purse.  Her change purse.  There you go.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:20:00]  The virus.  The One virus.  We'll have the Tom Brady song in just a second here.  Boston, if you haven't heard this yet, stay tuned.  Douche chills galore for everybody today.  It is just horrid.  We just found out that old Jimmy Norton went to a bed and breakfast over the weekend.  It was nice.  You must be in love, man.  Well, we both decided that we wanted to go to a bed and breakfast. 
[00:20:30]  No, you didn't.  She wanted to go to a bed and breakfast.  I'm like, all right, let's do it.  It was nicer than I thought it was going to be.  What did they get?  What did you get?  A bed and breakfast, didn't you?  The food was awful, too.  Why, it's home-cooked?  Yeah, I was expecting that.  Why, you know?  I was expecting a big meal.  I'm like, this is going to be fantastic.  I woke up.  I got like two hours sleep.  Breakfast was 8.30.  I woke up at 6.30.  I was so anxious for my country breakfast.  And it was, we go out, it was just, my girlfriend and I are in this big area, and the man of 
[00:21:00]  questionable sexual orientation who walks out barefoot and serves our breakfast.  It's eggs, scrambled eggs with some green stuff in them, like a little parsley or something.  And then, what were they called?  They were corn cakes.  Corn cakes?  Yeah, they're like pancakes, but they taste disgusting.  Like corn?  Oh, God.  He goes, could you not cook like the 1800s?  He brought me, he brought us, it's two corn cakes. 
[00:21:30]  They're like pancakes made out of corn, out of cornmeal.  I heard they were Robert Reed's favorites.  Yeah, and the guy goes, well, it's a nice change of pace.  Really?  Is it?  From what?  Sausage?  Must be out of sausage.  You know, we're supposed to be shock jocks.  You shouldn't be hanging out at a bed and breakfast.  Dude, it was...  I would go to a bed and breakfast.  I know you wouldn't.  I said that to her while we were eating.  I'm like, Ope would love this place, and Ant would want to burn it to the ground.  Of course.  Oh, this is Ant's worst nightmare.  Going to a bed and breakfast. 
[00:22:00]  I don't stay over people's houses that I know.  I don't stay over my mother's house.  This has happened before.  I've gone over my mother's house, and she goes, oh, you could stay.  She's got rooms all over her house and stuff that I could stay in.  And I go, nah, I'm just going to go to the hotel right across the expressway.  It's about a quarter mile drive to a hotel, because I don't like staying at people's houses.  Bed and breakfast, you're staying at someone's house.  Yeah.  Yeah, why? 
[00:22:30]  And then you have breakfast, and you share your experience with other couples.  Holy Jesus Christ.  And then they have tea time.  Who cares?  Did you do tea time, Jimmy?  No, we actually didn't see.  The only person we saw, there was a sauna up the steps, which was cool.  And right next to it, there was a room.  And we saw an older gentleman coming down the next morning, kind of balding and just kind of a creep.  Did you stay at the North Dome?  No.  The Mount Tobias?  Yes, that was the room.  The Mount Tobias room.  All right. 
[00:23:00]  I'll click on the picture.  So people, you know, you know our pests.  They could get, they could get everything.  Oh, they probably heard us on Pal Talk.  Yes.  It's the, I forget, Ontario.  Oh, that's very nice.  Very Victorian, I guess.  Yeah.  Got a lot of slats up and down the wall.  That looks horrible.  You got a little wood-burning stove.  Did you get a crackling fire going in the wood-burning stove?  Did you?  It was a fake fire.  She just flicked the switch and the fire was going, which was nice.  Yeah, they're getting rid of the real fires in all these places. 
[00:23:30]  Bottle of, a bottle.  A box of Kleenex up on there for easy cleanup.  One thing I don't see.  What?  Something very important when I'm in a hotel.  A television.  No, there was no TV.  No TV.  Because they want you to socialize.  They want you to socialize with the other couples, Anthony.  Was there a TV downstairs?  Yeah, yeah.  So you could all sit with the people that are staying and watch Jeopardy?  The community television.  And know all the answers?  Because you've been stuck there forever until you learn love?  You can watch the host's favorite films, Philadelphia, Boys in the Band Played On. 
[00:24:00]  Every episode of The Brady Punch and Macmillan and Wife.  The owner was a bit on the gee side.  I don't know if he was gay.  Hey, hey, hey.  Every guy that owns a bed and breakfast is gay.  It's just the way it is.  You want to open a bed and breakfast and you're a guy?  You're gay.  Whether you know it or not.  What if it's an older couple and they're just bored and they want to socialize a little bit? 
[00:24:30]  The guy probably is gay or was gay in his younger years and then settled down.  Well, the guy – I don't think he was gay.  He actually – he was living with two older women and they said one night he had to leave  because he was going to see his friend who was in a production, which a lot of straight  men do, they'll leave to see their friend in a production, perhaps.  A production?  A theater piece, yes.  A theater – first of all, what theater is even near a bed and breakfast?  We were near Woodstock.  Who was it?  The guy that did Waiting for Guffman?  It's community theater, right.  Community theater? 
[00:25:00]  Oh, you should have gone.  Would have been a hoot.  I had a surprisingly good time.  You did.  I did.  I enjoyed my bed and breakfast experience.  See, you know what I don't like about bed and breakfast?  That just means you're in love.  I don't know.  I mean, maybe –  Jimmy's in love.  I don't know.  Or staying in people's houses or bed and breakfast.  You can't just throw your garbage all over the place.  Oh, yes, you can.  And then expect other people to clean it up.  No, I mean everything. 
[00:25:30]  I'm talking tissues, you know, that aren't used for your nose.  Throw them on the floor.  I don't care.  Hey, woman who probably doesn't have a green card, clean this up.  That's what I'm talking about.  You could leave it a mess.  You could – I've stayed in hotel rooms for like four days straight without even leaving the room.  Room service piled up.  He tells us this like we're surprised.  Wow, really?  We've been on the road with you.  We know.  That's just it.  You don't like to socialize or leave your hotel room. 
[00:26:00]  Anthony just disappears.  He's like, well, I'll get to a destination.  We'll be checking in the hotel.  All of a sudden, him and his girlfriend are gone.  And we're like, all right, it's Friday afternoon.  We'll see you Monday morning waiting for the –  We catch up on every movie that we missed in movie theaters because they're all degenerates that go to the movies too.  And that's it.  Room service.  You go to bed and breakfast.  What do you get?  You get corn cakes.  They're called Johnny Cakes according to Dave.  Oh, those are the Johnny Cakes?  Let's see.  Dave, what's up?  Oh, no.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, are they Johnny Cakes? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, they're Johnny Cakes.  What's a Johnny Cake?  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  What's a Johnny Cake made out of?  Johnny Cake is just a – it's a pancake made with cornbread.  It's a gay pancake.  And the Sopranos ended this bed and breakfast.  Oh, dude, these things were horrid.  They were made out of – he said they were made out of corn and creamed corn.  Oh, I bet it was creamed.  It wasn't creamed before he got to it.  And then what happened?  You were talking about he had a corn or a bunion?  He had a bunion.  It looked like his foot was signaling for a right. 
[00:27:00]  I've never seen a bunion that big on a human being.  I got a question.  Why did you notice – how did you notice his bunion?  Because he was barefooted.  When?  As he was serving our food.  All right, see?  Get the – get out of here.  It's completely normal, Anthony.  No, it's not.  You don't want barefoot people serving you food.  You're not allowed to –  What's going to happen?  You're not allowed to goddamn restaurant without your shoes on.  Play it through.  What's going to happen?  He's picking his frigging feet.  That's what they do upstate. 
[00:27:30]  You don't think the guy delivering your room service isn't picking his nose before he lifts up those freaking things for you?  I ain't seeing it.  Out of sight, out of mind.  If I got to look at a bunion –  The guy's not picking his feet in front of Jimmy?  It's like he was taking that stuff from the socks that builds up in between your toes and flicking it in our corn cakes.  And your Johnny cakes.  Oh, it's a nice – it's a nice change of pace.  That's what he said.  It's a nice change of pace.  What's a change of pace?  Corn cakes.  Oh, I thought being with a girl.  Were you always creeped out by gooey stuff and, like, germs and stuff? 
[00:28:00]  It's not so much germs.  Gooey stuff.  Gooey, disgusting things.  It's not the germ factor.  It's just that it's disgusting that gets me.  I could care less about germs.  It's nice.  You look at the mountains, disgusting with the man.  Did he go for a nature walk, Jimmy?  No, we didn't.  We didn't go for a nature walk.  Didn't they have activities for you?  I don't know.  I think they had hiking options.  Of course there's hiking.  What else is there to do?  Did you rent a bike?  A bicycle?  No, we saw in Woodstock we could.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  But we both had to use the bathrooms.  We had to go back to the hotel.  We both all of a sudden got hit with that corn cake coffee mix.  Fight for the can.  And was it a community bathroom?  No, no, no.  We had our own bathroom.  The bathroom was actually very nice.  It looked like it was new.  It had a skylight.  It had a really nice jacuzzi.  A really nice jacuzzi.  So we took a jacuzzi with some eucalyptus oil and looked at the stars.  Ah, okay.  That's romantic.  Yeah.  Now, there was an animal in the house?  Two dogs. 
[00:29:00]  Of course.  They have two dogs.  Something for other people to take care of when he's eating broth later in life.  Just something to keep him company.  Yeah.  Friends can't make it over anymore because they're working on other productions.  Productions.  Wink, wink.  Someone suggested-  Producing some white corpuscles.  Someone suggested-  I need them.  It wasn't-  You didn't have tea time up there.  You had tea cell time.  Where they counted down to the last one.  Bag it.  We did not have tea time.  It was a very nice experience.  The bed and breakfast.  I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. 
[00:29:30]  Ah!  Someone is saying that-  Ah, where is it?  Bed and breakfast.  Another name.  Neil and Swallow.  Steven asked from Bayshore.  Well, that sounds like you had a wonderful time.  Yeah, we went to nice restaurants.  This is not the Jimmy I know.  We went to some fancy restaurants to eat just to be nice for the weekend.  Did you find a comedy club up there?  No, I did not.  You obsessed freak.  Michael Richards, the only place Lefty can go.  No, I did not go. 
[00:30:00]  You're really in love.  No, we just-  We had fun a little bit.  We had fun.  Admit it.  You're in love.  That's nice.  Well, you know, we like each other a lot.  We decided to go away and-  What's wrong with that?  That's sweet.  What's wrong with going to bed and breakfast?  You have to be on a stage every single night of your life.  So if you're taking time to go to a bed and breakfast over the weekend, you know, you've  got that feeling inside, Jimmy.  We took off Thursday.  Well, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, I took off, and then we just went to nice places.  We drove to a town called Hudson, which is just a dump in upstate New York. 
[00:30:30]  And we had this restaurant called Swoon, which is supposed to be really fancy.  It was mediocre.  And they wouldn't make the- I wanted fruit, and the pastry chef wouldn't cut up a pear  for me because that wasn't on the menu.  It's sooner you'd at a radioactive sushi place in England than at Swoon.  I'm so done looking at that bald freak.  Like bald-headed spy.  Oh, my God.  What a ghoul.  Oh, my God.  Poor bastard.  I didn't even get that.  Oh. 
[00:31:00]  That was great.  Oh, my.  Oh, cancer head.  Oh, radioactive sushi, though.  How about it?  How great is that?  Wow.  That's some real spy crap.  How the hell did they get it in the sushi, and how small is it?  They were saying that it might have been a spray.  A spray?  A guy could have just sprayed on his sushi.  Eats it, and then it just-  You eat it, and it's over, Johnny.  You're done.  Unbelievable.  It was like one of the most rare radioactive compounds on the face of the earth.  Did they know who did it?  Well, it could have been the guy he was eating with who was a nuclear specialist. 
[00:31:30]  They're just finding that out.  Roger, if I slip in a 50, go ahead, spray that.  Yeah, that's all it takes.  Just a little spray.  Well, that's lovely.  Yeah.  The closest I ever got was staying at a house upstate, but I rented the whole house and stayed  there for like a week.  No, so you had a worse experience, Anthony.  And I went hiking and got lost.  Well, yeah, but-  Oh.  What about the Poconos?  I almost got eaten by a bear.  What about the Poconos?  But that's fun because you know it's going to be a goof. 
[00:32:00]  I've always done that as a goof.  Dude, for someone who doesn't like, you know, gooey substances, you shouldn't be going to  the Poconos.  Oh, they clean up the room before you get there.  I don't care.  Oh, really?  Why don't you do that?  And I don't have to see anybody.  Get a blacklight and you'll see how good they clean up those rooms.  I know that.  But, you know, you're just there for the sex anyway.  Those stupid Poconos things with the stupid big champagne glass in your room.  Oh, you just sit there in pitch blackness, having sex and ordering pizza. 
[00:32:30]  That's pretty much it.  No, I never went to one of those.  No, they're awful.  But it's funny.  It's funny.  You go there and you see people that are there, like from Iowa on their honeymoon.  And you're just there to laugh, you know, laugh at the people.  It is fun.  Expensive suite, so they can't get it.  Yeah.  Honeymoon suite.  I'm in the Caesar room.  Hey, you guys want to-  Bloody gold paint.  You want to squeeze in the Tom Brady song before we take a break?  Oh.  Yeah.  I love the Tom Brady song.  This guy. 
[00:33:00]  Phillip from Boca Raton.  Opie, congrats on the Jets' win over the Texans.  Too bad my sorry-ass Giants are going in the opposite direction.  What happened?  I thought they were winning.  The Giants?  Tune the game out in the fourth.  What happened?  It was 21-0.  They ended up losing 24-21.  Yeah.  They were up 21-0 and they lost-  21-0 in the fourth.  Eli is a-  Ew.  Eli Manning is a bust.  What douches.  This guy panics.  Maybe, but 21-0 if your defense-  Unless he threw interceptions.  Because if that defense gave up that many points in that short a period of time, they 
[00:33:30]  should all have their heads cut off.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure there was some cough-ups.  Giant collapse.  It's on all the front pages of the newspapers.  How about them Cowboys?  How about them Cowboys?  Oh, America's team.  Billy Bandwagon.  Now I'm watching him again after that 35-3 smashing a 38-10 win, whatever it was.  Yeah, they beat the Buccaneers 38-10.  Would you listen to it on the radio at the bed and breakfast?  No, I was at Bob Kelly's house for Thanksgiving.  My girlfriend was away.  So I went to Bob Kelly's house and I was talking to him and then I realized it was the turkey  and then I had to look and then it was across the room. 
[00:34:00]  Nothing.  I don't.  Dude, I saw a tourgasm on Friday night at Westbury Music Fair on Long Island.  I just happened to be like 10 minutes away from the place and Bob Kelly calls me.  He goes, I don't know.  If you want to go, I got tickets for you.  I'm like, I'm 10 minutes away.  Yeah, I'll go.  We have to have an intervention though.  Bob, I've never seen anyone fatter that's not supposed to be fat.  There are fat guys out there and you're supposed to be fat basically.  Yeah.  Bob Kelly is not supposed to be fat and he is a fat guy now. 
[00:34:30]  He's stretching.  It looks like he's stretching.  We have to have an intervention.  His legs are still thin and he is massive at this point.  Yeah.  He should be in a chocolate factory.  Turning blue.  It looks like his skin is going to split.  It doesn't look like natural on him.  No.  Some guys that are fat, they're supposed to be fat.  They look, you know, they look all right.  And they're comfy and they're loose type skin.  Exactly.  He looks like he's going to explode. 
[00:35:00]  He's so fat.  He was losing weight too.  He was doing a fat smash.  And Bob is just like I am.  He's a compulsive psycho.  And now he's caught up on eating because he's with his girlfriend.  So he can't go out and do other stuff.  He's, you know, he's in a relationship.  So he just takes it out on food.  Just, you know.  Dude, he's got to be, I would have to guess, 60 to 70 pounds heavier since the first time  I met him, which is only a few years ago.  I think I met him maybe three years ago.  Has to be, right?  Maybe.  I don't remember.  I've seen him so much.  So to me, he just looks like Bob.  Anyway.  All right.  How about the show?  Huh? 
[00:35:30]  It was unbelievable.  Gary Goldman, man, was hilarious.  Gary's funny, man.  Gary's a psycho too.  Like, I would love to really get into his psychosis because he's a big, angry son of a bitch.  He's a really funny dude.  I would love to just get into his head, man.  Spitting a guy's face in the comedy club.  Some guy was heckling him when Gary told him, I'm going to spit in your face.  And apparently the guy kept talking and not realizing who he was dealing with, and Goldman  hocked one in his face.  Wow.  How do you not love Gary Goldman?  Carries out a threat.  He's big enough, too.  He's a big, big bastard.  And you know what?  Jay Davis did a good job, too. 
[00:36:00]  He does well.  I didn't really like him on Torgasm on HBO, but he did a really good job up there.  Who closed it, Bobby or Gary?  Gary did.  They switched off.  By the way, Football Pick, sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  We have a new leader, Anthony.  Yes.  Of course, we've got $10,000 up for grabs, courtesy of Dish Network.  Travis is our new leader.  Steve is finally faltering.  Steve only had one right this past week.  Travis had three right. 
[00:36:30]  We only picked five games a week.  Travis is now in the lead.  Did your friend in the bed and breakfast help you out?  I think Steve, he didn't have his heart into it this weekend because the guy that invented  the Prius died over the weekend.  I couldn't be happier.  You read that story?  No, but as you were saying it, I couldn't be happier.  Dude, he was flying an experimental aircraft.  Probably one that was healthy for the environment. 
[00:37:00]  Something.  And the damn thing crashed.  And the guy that invented the Prius, the car that Steve drives, is dead.  Where's the story?  Do we have it in front of us?  That should have been front and center.  That should have been the...  There he goes.  Oh, that's terrible.  Here it is.  A Toyota Motor Corp executive engineer described as the American father of the Prius and who 
[00:37:30]  was among the country's top experts on gas-electric hybrid vehicles, died in a plane crash.  How did the inventor of the Prius die?  David Hermontz, 59.  I'm sorry.  Was piloting an experimental plane when it went down Saturday afternoon about 50 yards  off Los Angeles-San Pedro area.  A search team found the wreckage of the two-passenger Interavia E3 aircraft submerged in 60 feet of 
[00:38:00]  water Sunday morning.  Dead.  This single-engine plane is classified as experimental by the FAA.  It is based on a Russian design and often is used in aerobatics.  Oh, that's good.  So Steve was, uh...  You think Steve was upset?  He could have been, uh, upset.  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  He stinks and I don't like him.  Wow. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  It's terrible.  Uh, Stephen from Bayshore again.  Wow.  The football pick leader went from a bear to a twink.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  All right.  Uh, we'll have the Tom Brady song in just a minute here.  We promise.  As soon as we get out of break, let's not talk about bed and breakfast or anything else.  Let's get right into the Tom Brady song.  Because it's a bit on the, uh, uh, gee side.  Were there locks on the doors?  No.  Not on the front door, but you could lock your room from the inside.  Oh, okay. 
[00:39:00]  Just a little lock to flip.  But you couldn't lock it when you went out.  How'd it know?  And it's obsessed with the bed and breakfast.  You couldn't lock it when you went out, though.  So it's typically going to touch your possessions if they wanted to.  What?  It's about trust.  What?  About trust in that community.  Good.  It's 1850.  It's wonderful.  That's trust.  1800s.  Went to Woodstock and ate.  It was lovely.  Got to know some local people.  Roll around with some hippies in the mud.  A lot of hippies.  You freak.  A lot of hippies.  Yeah, that's their, uh, holy land.  Yeah. 
[00:39:30]  It was nice.  I'm sure it was.  It was freaking Anthony out.  Enjoy the bed and breakfast.  Bunion and breakfast.  How'd you eat staring at that thing?  It was really awful.  Can I have another bunion, please?  Oh, my God.  Goiter in his foot.  Why don't you fix that, you sissy?  Put on the socks or something.  Shoulder pads.  Put shoulder pads on it.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree. 
[00:40:00]  Only on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall.  Maybe one near you.  What?  What?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The Opie and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden buns is gonna get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit.  As we partake in another homeless shopping spree on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bye! 
[00:40:30]  Good morning, West Palm Beach.  Hey.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're flying to West Palm Beach, what, Friday?  Yep, Friday afternoon.  Gonna be at their bake sale on Saturday.  And then we're gonna do our show live in West Palm Beach Monday and Tuesday.  Monday and Tuesday.  The episode of Kenny was just giving us the scoop on the travel to West Palm Beach.  He hates to be the bearer of bad news.  You know, I don't want to point fingers. 
[00:41:00]  And boy, here comes a finger of pointing.  He says that as he's actually dusting his finger off to jab it in your face.  I don't want to accuse anybody of anything.  But.  But here it comes.  The eyes are wide.  There's no eye contact.  It's like a little head shake.  I don't want to say anything to upset you.  I'm so glad we're finally bringing this to the show.  Because he does it to all of us.  Here it comes.  Look, I don't want to upset you.  But.  You're like something upsetting.  Right.  If he would have just kept his mouth shut, guess what? 
[00:41:30]  I wouldn't be upset.  He's the bedside manner of Mengele.  I gotta give Club Store to Kenny props, though.  All weekend long, I was playing Vice City, Grand Theft Auto, on the PSP.  Yep.  But Club Store to Kenny is the star of the new Grand Theft Auto, Vice City's.  It's Vice City?  Vice City, I think.  I don't know.  Vice City.  Vice City Stories.  That's what I was missing.  Right.  Vice City Stories.  He does the Dodo commercials on the radio.  And when they come on, you can't even concentrate on your mission anymore. 
[00:42:00]  You just want to listen to Club Store to Kenny and that dopey voice of his.  Hey, kids.  Hey, kids.  Talking about, what, gun safety there?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it's not gun safety now, is it?  No.  You're encouraging the kids to shoot the guns.  That's the joke.  Of course, yeah.  I don't want to point any fingers.  Look, I don't want to upset you.  Know how many times I've heard that as he drives me to work in the morning?  You know, I don't want to put you, I hate to be the bearer of bad news. 
[00:42:30]  Like, hey, look, guys, this is just my mission.  I got to tell you.  Right.  But inside, you just know that there's fists going, yes.  Oh, he's loving it.  Not only does he want to be the bearer of bad news, he loses sleep because he can't wait  to tell you.  Yeah.  He wakes up thinking that someone else told you first and he's upset.  Yeah.  Right.  I got to get to him first and tell him before somebody else does.  When you were on the force, were you the guy that requested, can I go to the family's  house? 
[00:43:00]  He's probably the guy.  You know, I don't want to say maybe he was doing the wrong thing in the wrong place, but  he's dead.  Your boy, he's dead.  Okay, goodbye.  Just leave him in the tea.  He ain't coming home no more.  The mother's just sprawled out on the patio crying, goodbye.  You forgot one thing.  What?  Have a nice day anyway.  When you got in trouble, did they take your badge and sickle? 
[00:43:30]  You were going to me for a badge and sickle.  And as I walked out the door, I crossed his name off the mailbox.  Oh, my God.  Holy crap.  You might want to cancel his mail.  You guys want to hear Closer to Kenny and GTA?  Certainly do.  Vice City Stories as Derek the Dodo.  You're not Derek the Dodo, are you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, that's the character?  Yeah.  It made me laugh so freaking hard.  I heard everybody in the game.  I heard you doing the old-time radio, which was fantastic. 
[00:44:00]  Thank you, sir.  I saw E-Rock as the gay jogger.  There's only, I think, one gay jogger in the entire game.  It's E-Rock.  And I drive by him every once in a while, and I just chuckle because it's E-Rock.  And then you got to throw him a beating.  Yeah, I got to stop the car and beat you up.  Because it's E-Rock.  It's pretty cool, though.  If you haven't heard yet, we're all in Grand Theft Auto, Vice City Stories.  Except for Jimmy, because they gave him a starring role in that video game Bully.  Yep.  But everybody else.  I heard Than as the old guy going, ah, you're looking for sex, you sicko. 
[00:44:30]  Sicko.  And you hear Steve on the golf course.  No, I didn't get to the golf course.  Yeah, get to the golf course.  All right.  You look Steve and his buddies.  But here's Club Soda Kenny as Derek the Dodo from Vice City Stories.  Hey, kids, why spend Saturday watching boring cartoons about fighting aliens when you can  help fight real, illegal aliens?  Head to some real-life Saturday safety fun at AmmuNation with Derek the Dodo.  Yay!  Hi, kids. 
[00:45:00]  I'm Derek the Dodo.  Today, I'm going to teach you all about gun safety.  Doesn't that sound fun?  Yay!  Hi, Derek.  I love you.  Aw, that's sweet.  What's your question?  Um, when I find a gun at home, did you say to look down the barrel and pull the trigger?  Sure, honey.  Give it a go.  Like this?  Whoa!  Aw, gross!  Yeah!  You see?  Girls are stupid.  To heck if a gun is loaded, you should always point it away from you at an immigrant or a  banker. 
[00:45:30]  Yay!  AmmuNation and Derek the Dodo have been proudly bringing gun safety to your community for over  30 years.  AmmuNation.  Protecting your kids' rights.  AmmuNation!  You did a bunch of them, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, because I haven't heard that one yet in the game.  There's a couple other ones I've heard so far.  But it's a lot of fun.  It's been a horrible accident.  Your daughter is dead.  You know, you might want to look into the insurance on the car, though. 
[00:46:00]  You can make a buck or two.  I don't want to tell you what to do.  I don't want to say her head was rolling down Main Street and her brains were spilling on  the sidewalk.  You know, I don't want to tell you the gory details, but here they are.  I'd like to tell you she went quickly.  You might not want to hear this right.  She suffered terribly.  It might do you well to know she was screaming your name for the two hours of agony as they 
[00:46:30]  cut her out of the vehicle.  So, you know, I guess she liked you.  I'm so glad you brought this to the show because I would look at him like, you don't  want to be the bearer of bad news.  You couldn't wait to wake up this morning.  You always knew where he was because you'd just see a squad car with a black cloud over  it in the middle of where he went.  You ghoul.  He is a ghoul.  Hovering. 
[00:47:00]  All right.  Here's the Tom Brady song, finally.  This was brought to my attention.  It was in the inside track this morning.  Some guy, his name's BradyFan83.  I think he's a lawyer or something.  I don't know.  And he did a song parody for Tom Brady.  Is it supposed to be funny or is it supposed to be like endearing?  And the YouTube video shows like a montage.  A montage of Menti.  There he goes.  There's the Iraq response. 
[00:47:30]  I don't know.  A montage of just like sexy Brady photos.  He found sexy Brady photos.  It's really creepy.  And it's like about football.  Big win for the pass, by the way.  73-yard drive at the end of the game there.  Brady's unstoppable.  But this song is just, just gay.  This guy should just be a hit.  All right.  Well, why don't we take a listen and then you decide. 
[00:48:00]  If this is just an uber fan that is really into Tom Brady and the Pats.  Or if there's a gay thing going on here.  Okay.  All right.  That makes it gay right there.  You have to decide?  Is there a decision to make there?  Well, I mean, you know, he was using, you know, lady, obviously. 
[00:48:30]  So Brady, I'm like, all right, I'll give him, I'll give it to him.  That's easy.  If you're going to make a parody, Brady, lady.  Okay.  Now I got to find the lady song and rework the lyrics.  This was recorded in a bed and breakfast upstate idea.  All right.  My Cuban tight pants, and I love you.  You're the starter in my fantasy league for two. 
[00:49:00]  Brady, there's so many ways.  I want to catch your passes.  Won't you throw me...  Lovely voice.  Huh?  There's a lovely voice.  Doesn't he?  Yeah.  Still up in the air, whether it's gay or not.  Yeah, I guess.  I wonder we question that.  Won't you throw me something softly down the field? 
[00:49:30]  Your glass chin makes me such a fool.  Your eyes captivate.  And, oh, you have good protection. 
[00:50:00]  Won't you just throw me your ball?  I'm a tight end.  But I hope one day to be your wide receiver.  That old gag.  Right.  That was funny when Bob Nelson did it 25 years ago. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, God.  This guy's a hack.  Boy, he's a hack.  I played it for his stupid friends.  How I long for you to be in the slot forever.  Let there be two days when we can play together.  Nice.  Let me hear you call your heart a boss in my ear. 
[00:51:00]  Does anybody remember laughing?  On the field, I see no one else but you.  Turn it off.  There's no one...  Turn it off.  ...playing for me.  Yeah.  Is that supposed to be sexy? 
[00:51:30]  All right.  You can act like a man.  Well, this guy, he only wants to be known as BF83.  He's an attorney from Texas.  BF, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it's pretty funny.  It's a little bit of a satire on the adoration of athletes, said BF,  and a little bit on the homoeroticism in sports.  A little bit? 
[00:52:00]  It works on many levels, he says.  No, it doesn't.  It's a stupid gay joke.  Don't try to make it like you're some social experimenter.  And then he writes,  I'm very much hetero, said BF.  I'm married with kids,  but I have no problem singing lyrics like that because it's so much fun.  What a douche.  He's got a beard.  Actually, he's tapping into something none of us noticed before.  Yeah, it's a hacky song parody.  Shut up.  You're a hacky song parody writer.  It's not like it's going to get you a radio show.  It's getting a lot of attention on YouTube and in Boston today. 
[00:52:30]  There you have it.  Hey, sticking with the gay theme, you want to read the Anderson Cooper thing?  Oh, please.  Where is a...  Here, here.  You got that copy.  Here it is.  I didn't even know about this.  You guys brought it up the other day.  I had no idea that there was some allegations being made.  Allegations?  They've been talking about that for years.  Allegations being made.  Allegations that, what, Anderson Cooper ran a bed and breakfast somewhere?  That he has a bunion? 
[00:53:00]  Anderson Cooper was friendly at a Brazilian airport on Friday.  Hi, I'm Anderson, he said to the attractive man standing next to him at the Flight Connection  monitors in the Salvador terminal.  A spy told the Post's Brian Keel.  The 25-ish fellow was wearing a tight T-shirt, cut-off shorts, and an earring.  According to our witness, the unshaven, solo-traveling CNN star chatted for 20 minutes with the stranger 
[00:53:30]  before the fellow had to say goodbye and board his flight to Rio.  Ooh.  Cut-off shorts.  Wow.  Tight T-shirt, earring.  Slender.  Spanish.  Slender with hairless Brazilian legs.  Perfect for wrestling.  Never any clipping going on.  Never.  His whole life.  Just au naturel.  Anderson likes it.  Good snuffle-uffagus. 
[00:54:00]  Page Six really tried to sex that up.  They really did.  They really tried to sex that whole thing up.  They said it all right here without actually saying.  Why don't they just come out then and say it?  If you want to say it, say it.  But they kind of, this isn't even a hint.  This is, hey, we're saying Anderson Cooper is gay on page six.  Why is attractive in quotes?  Like someone like, he's attractive.  Well, if he is attractive, why would you quote that?  It's all less subjective.  You say that if you're talking to a burn victim. 
[00:54:30]  It's all less subjective.  Anyone watch the Thanksgiving Day parade there?  Where they dragged the balloons down the street?  That's pretty much what they had to do.  Did you see what, yeah, they were maybe five inches off the ground.  They had to drag them down the street because of the wind.  Why bother?  They're afraid of killing another family.  Yeah, we should point that out.  Yeah, they were dragging these balloons down.  Usually they're, what, 50 feet in the air?  Yeah, they're pretty high up.  They're full of helium, so they're supposed to float.  And then you pull them down the street.  And occasionally in the wind, they hit a street lamp and they fall on a family from Iowa. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, stupid, yeah, lamppost falls on a dummy.  So now we have to look at the balloons being dragged down the street.  Dragged down the street.  It was pretty windy, though, from what I hear.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they played it safe.  They played it so safe, you didn't even know which freaking balloons they were.  But anyway, that's not why I brought it up.  Doogie Howser there, who came out of the closet recently.  He did.  He was like a man on the street guy.  And now he's real gay. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, did he?  Is he?  What happens with the, I guess they get, they feel so free that they're finally out of the  closet.  They just let the gayness just flow, man.  Let the gayness flow.  Holy crap.  Get the audio of Doogie Howser from the Thanksgiving Day Parade.  It's like, that's Doogie Howser?  He was doing some coverage for a channel or something?  Yeah.  Yeah, he did.  I mean, honestly, he did a good job.  Of course he did.  But Neil Patrick Harris, thank you.  Yes.  All of a sudden.  Neil.  All of a sudden, he has the gay voice.  The gay voice. 
[00:56:00]  You come out of the closet, then it's acceptable to have the gay voice, I guess.  Does it sound like this?  The balloons are making their way down Broadway.  It's a wonderful sight here on the Thanksgiving Day Parade.  Imagine if Steve ever comes out of the closet, how gay he's going to sound.  Here it is.  With the Grand Marshal in his convertible Prius driving down.  Of course, the convertible top is only at half-mast for its inventor, who's dead. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, I want to hear that.  McGreevy's in the closet for all these years.  Now he's house shopping with this guy.  I haven't drilled in all the rest areas.  McGreevy came flying out of the closet.  Can't get enough of it.  Oh, he loves it.  Handful and mouthful.  You can't stop.  You put one down for five minutes, Jim.  Get some work done, for God's sake.  He's kicking his ex-wife's body over.  Here, take the alimony.  He's making up a lost time.  Look at how he had to spend with that disgusting thing that his wife has.  Pulls her panties off.  Here's your alimony, you incomplete person. 
[00:57:00]  Anyway, we were talking about that thing in Sharper Image.  It's a saddle.  It's supposed to be an exercise machine.  Yeah, it looks like it's supposed to simulate riding a horse.  It's called the new O-S-I-M.  How would you pronounce that?  Awesome?  It's awesome.  Awesome, yeah.  I gallop.  Core and abs exerciser.  It doesn't have any kind of marital aid on it. 
[00:57:30]  It's not like that.  Well, they're trying to claim this is to get your body in shape.  Wow.  Looking good and feeling great just got a whole lot easier.  The awesome eye gallop is the revolutionary exerciser that can help you shape and tone  your tummy, hips, seat, and thighs.  Seat.  They call it a seat?  They call it a seat.  You can't even say buns or abs.  Bottom.  Botox.  Buns.  My seat.  Your buns.  How sexless. 
[00:58:00]  The secret is in its zero-impact tri-axial riding action.  Oh, of course it is.  Your body automatically responds to its multi-directional movement, and this balancing engages certain  muscle groups and may help improve coordination and posture.  Why don't they?  They're trying to claim that you're going to get in shape by riding this thing.  Why don't they just shape it like a little horsey and you say, father who says, come  on, no more rides when you're five.  Not included.  The fun and easy way to exercise your abs at home.  Exercising your abdominal muscles usually means hard, boring work. 
[00:58:30]  Eye Gallop abs exercise equipment makes shaping and toning fun and automatic by moving your  body in multiple directions.  Ordinary exercise equipment for abs and thighs can be tedious and ineffective.  Eye Gallop gives a great core body workout, and it's fun to ride.  They have a similar one for children.  It's called Uncle's Knee.  You've got to try to stay on.  It's called the Eye Repress, as in memories.  The eye dissociates. 
[00:59:00]  Abs exercise equipment.  That's also great for hips, seats, and thighs.  Seat.  Why can't they just say your ass or your buttocks?  That's not sexual.  No one calls it their seat.  No one does.  One of the unique things about Eye Gallop is that it engages so many core muscle groups  at once.  It's a great way to exercise your abs at home, and it shapes and tones your hips, buttocks,  finally, they say, and thighs, too.  Workout while you watch TV.  Unlike some exercise equipment for abs and thighs, Eye Gallop requires no complex, time-consuming 
[00:59:30]  training.  Simply hop on and get a great workout just by riding.  Yeah.  Substitute another word for workout, by the way.  This is a get-off machine.  Can we get an Eye Gallop?  No.  We want to get one of our strippers from headquarters or something and go down there and ride this  thing the way they want you to ride this thing without this stupid advertising claiming  it's an exercise machine and see how long it takes before ... That's the bit. 
[01:00:00]  How long it takes before the people at Sharper Image tell you to get off the thing.  Yeah, wearing a miniskirt.  Right.  Being inappropriate, ma'am.  Pants.  You're being inappropriate.  What we do is we send them into two different places.  We send a really fat girl into one and a really hot chick into the other and just see if there's  any difference in how long it takes them to get out.  All right.  That's a good hack radio idea.  My entertainment tonight.  My Vanessa.  Maybe I should put on a fat suit and do it myself.  Stupid wash woman.  You said one woman with a big seat.  One with a slender seat. 
[01:00:30]  There's a bit there.  Yeah.  How about selling this as an exercise machine?  It's just another way for the women to, you know, take care of themselves.  I say we get a guy and put him on there and give him two cups of open scalding coffee and  then push him.  Watch him try to burn his hands and forearms.  It does seem like they're trying to sell.  It's like a little bull riding machine.  Yeah.  And the idea is that as it's moving around, you're trying to balance on it.  It's going to tone your muscles.  Nah.  Sorry.  That's, nah. 
[01:01:00]  You got to work a little harder than that.  Pick it up.  You know what you do?  Lay on your back, get underneath it, and lift it a few times.  Right.  It's pretty much the only exercise you're going to get out of it.  But they have a tent on there.  She's beautiful with her hands on her hips.  And there's a little balance thing there to hold on to, like a handle you can hold into  the front of it.  She doesn't seem to need to, though.  She certainly doesn't.  She's an iGallop pro.  A pro.  Hey, we got the Michael Richards apology.  Oh, good.  Thank God.  I want to hear this.  He's just been apologizing ever since he's done this.  Yeah.  What was it, like a week ago now? 
[01:01:30]  Last weekend, so.  Last week.  Of course, he goes off on people at the Laugh Factory in L.A. and uses the N-word.  He's on his apology tour.  Yeah.  He's feeling the pressure.  He goes on this huge show.  You know, you might have heard of it, David Letterman.  And apologizes.  And apologizes.  But that wasn't good enough for the black community for some odd reason.  Even though every news network in the world picked up the clips from David Letterman.  So the black community got to see Michael Richards apologize. 
[01:02:00]  But it wasn't good enough.  He has to actually go on a black show.  A black show.  Yes.  Which is more separatism, by the way.  So he had to go on the black show.  I just don't get it.  So he went on Jesse Jackson's show.  Yeah.  He apologized for saying what he said.  And then Jesse Jackson apologized for saying Hymeetown.  Hymeetown?  I don't think so.  No, of course not.  And yeah, he apologized on Jesse Jackson's show.  But now this isn't good enough either.  Now the two victims are saying that he and their lawyer.  What's that woman's name? 
[01:02:30]  Why do they need a lawyer?  Hate speech, Jimmy.  Hate speech.  Yeah, Gloria Allred.  It stinks.  It's saying, yeah, she's the lawyer.  Now, I saw a clip from Hannity and Combs, and she's saying that these people deserve a face-to-face with Michael Richards and a retired judge so the judge can figure out what type of damages should be not given, but what kind of compensation should be given to these two guys because of the damages that have been done. 
[01:03:00]  They want money.  What a vulturistic pig she is.  She's a pig.  She's a slob.  A pig.  Oh, C-word.  She's got to be a size queen.  No, I don't know.  Meh.  She's got to be a size queen.  No, I don't think she's anything about men.  No.  I don't think she's anything about men.  You would think you could get away with just about anything in a comedy club, but I guess you can't.  No.  She goes, this isn't about freedom of speech.  And then to Combs – no, it actually wasn't even Combs. 
[01:03:30]  It was the lawyer.  What's his name?  Liberal lawyer.  Ponytail.  Oh, stupid Ron Cooby.  Pain in the ass, Ron Cooby.  Yeah.  What's he say?  I can't stand him either.  No.  But he was saying it is free speech.  Okay, he's right.  It has to be free speech.  Of course it is, especially in a comedy club.  Granted, he didn't do it to be funny.  He just lost his mind.  We all have that in our arsenal, by the way.  Every single person listening to us has that in their arsenal, and they will use it if they're pushed.  The atomic bomb.  And they will use it if they're pushed far enough.  Yeah.  And Michael Richards was pushed far enough, and he went with it. 
[01:04:00]  And he didn't handle it like a good comedian.  I mean, what he did was over the line.  It was wrong.  He should apologize.  But it's like enough groveling.  You said you were sorry.  Just mean it as a person.  Shut your face and move on.  Yeah.  Stop it, you worm.  You got $60 million in the bank.  What do you need?  You're going to go out and do another mediocre comedy tour?  Yeah.  Nobody cares.  So you guys want to hear the apology?  The two black guys that are the victims, their account of the whole thing was hysterical, too,  because it was all done through their lawyer.  Like, you could tell the way they were talking. 
[01:04:30]  It was all pre-set up by their lawyer.  And it was all, well, we had come in, and we were late, so we had to sit in the balcony,  and we were ordering drinks, and perhaps we were being a little too loud.  Right.  That's what happened.  You know something?  That's right.  How about you understand first, even if that was the case, you ever walk into a comedy club  and people start ordering drinks loudly?  Yeah.  You want to turn around and smash them in the face?  Nah, you know what?  Do they know where they are?  Dude, that's BS.  Those guys purposely were obnoxious.  They were being obnoxious. 
[01:05:00]  And went after Michael Richards.  Michael Richards came back at them way overboard.  And that's what happened.  That's what happened.  Why can't they just admit they were heckling?  Now they want money.  They have to try to get the money.  For what?  And it's got to be in front of a retired judge because it's not a case about free speech  because there's freedom of speech.  If he gives them anything, he should be shot.  Yeah, well.  All right, well, here's the audio.  Everyone wants to hear this today.  This is Michael Richards on Jesse Jackson's radio show. 
[01:05:30]  Was it a radio show or TV show yesterday?  Who knows what he's got.  Did you even know he had a show at all?  No, no clue.  Of course not.  I'm sure it's good.  But here you go.  Michael Richards apologizing yesterday on Jesse Jackson's radio show.  Not right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a wonderful setup with E-Rox.  You didn't put the CD in?  E-Rox.  And the CD's not even in the player.  You didn't put the CD?  All dramatically hitting the button like, here it is.  And there's no CD in the player.  All right.  It's in there.  Anyway, I just want to say that I'm sorry. 
[01:06:00]  I lost my temper and I probably shouldn't have.  I took it out on you and...  Look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior, well then, I'm sorry.  I apologize.  Even though you know, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it.  I mean, who's kidding who?  Well, they tell me that you're very upset and, God forbid, I should disturb the very important monkey.  I'm just hoping we can put this behind us. 
[01:06:30]  Let's just move on with our lives, okay?  You know, I don't think apologies like that are going to help Mr. Richards' position in this whole debacle.  Now, how come his Letterman apology seemed so much more sincere than that one?  And why were the people laughing?  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the 2006 Eggnog Challenge, coming to the Opie and Anthony show, Friday, December 1st. 
[01:07:00]  If you have a hankering for rich, creamy, thick holiday eggnog goodness, and a lot of it,  then you need to step up and take the Eggnog Challenge.  For details on how to participate, visit opieandanthony.com or foundrymusic.com.  It's the 2006 Eggnog Challenge, Friday, December 1st. 
[01:07:30]  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O and A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit xmradio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We were discussing this new exercise equipment.  What is it called?  The iGallop?  The iGallop.  It's at, what, Brookstone? 
[01:08:00]  I think so.  It looks like a bucking bronco.  Look, there's people out there, just about everybody.  They want to be a star.  They want to be a star on YouTube.  We have a suggestion for a YouTube video.  We're going to start giving you suggestions for YouTube videos, so you can be a star.  We want someone to get on the iGallop at Brookstone, get a friend to videotape it, incognito.  Yeah, you can't do it.  And we want someone to ride that thing.  It's moving around like crazy, and we want you to power boot in the middle of Brookstone. 
[01:08:30]  Just puke all over the place.  Film the thing, get it on YouTube, guaranteed a million views.  That's what we do now.  We come up with ways to make you a star out there.  That's your video.  A little creative as far as how you videotape it, I guess.  Well, everyone's trying to, you know.  Just go in with a camera.  Well, everyone's trying to come up with their YouTube video.  There you go.  There's a great suggestion.  We might even try it.  We've got to find someone that could power boot on command.  Gun Q.  That would be so funny, the guy coming over asking questions, you know. 
[01:09:00]  So, what is this going to do?  Well, it, you know, tightens and tones this muscle.  And as he's talking, the guy just goes, it's kind of making me feel a little weird.  Yeah, that's all right.  Yeah, no, that's all right.  I know, but I'm feeling muscles tightening up, that's for sure.  Like in my stomach.  Yeah, that's what you feel.  Projectile.  Speaking of which, four days and counting.  Eggnog drinking contest this Friday on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:09:30]  That's Friday?  Four lousy days away.  That's it.  Action-packed day Friday.  It's going to be great.  Adam Farrar, everybody.  Hey.  Adam, my pal.  Welcome to the program today.  Hey, pal.  How you doing there?  I'm good.  Friday afternoon, that's when you should send him down to ride that thing.  After the eggnog.  I'm thinking.  That's what I'm thinking.  Eggnog and then some puking.  That's what I'm thinking.  Then the guy will say, can I interest you in the eye mop?  Yeah, that little robotic mop.  Cleans up vomit just like that.  Well, we'd be able to get him on the show, though.  If they're here, how are they going to go there and puke after the contest? 
[01:10:00]  The contest is over on the CBS side?  They'll just start drinking again.  All right.  Drinking more eggnog.  Yeah.  We should do it.  They don't care.  We should get that video done.  Yeah.  All right.  We threw it out there, though.  Maybe someone is motivated enough to try it themselves.  If we got people down here Friday that are going to be drinking a lot of eggnog, perfect  opportunity.  All right.  Maybe they'll have an Opie and Anthony shirt on.  Yeah.  Perfect.  That is good.  I had an observation.  I wasn't really sure about my observation.  Then I played the audio for Anthony, and he goes, oh, my God, yes.  Yeah.  Good call on your observation. 
[01:10:30]  Doogie Howser.  What's his real name?  Neil Patrick Harris?  Neil Patrick Harris.  He finally came out of the closet.  I guess it's been known.  He was kind of shoved out.  He was shoved out.  Another guy that was shoved out.  Yeah.  He was poked and prodded out of the closet.  Yeah.  Apparently, he was skipping through life.  Everything was fine and dandy.  But there had always been these rumors.  Speculation.  Induendo.  And somebody finally said, yeah, he's gay.  So he came out and said, yeah, I'm gay, and I'm proud now. 
[01:11:00]  And I've noticed when these guys come out of the closet, all of a sudden, they start talking very gay.  They get the gay talk.  Now, you might say, what is that?  Shut up.  You know what it is.  We all know.  You know what it is.  We all know.  I like when people go, you tell me then what the gay talk is.  There it is.  Tell me what it is.  There it is.  It's a real, like the S's are very pronounced.  Let's just put it this way.  You add the word super to your vocabulary. 
[01:11:30]  There's certain words that are fabulous is one of them.  And a certain way you talk, it's more feminine.  Very good diction.  Right.  For lack of a word.  Very good diction.  It's just a lovely lilt to your voice.  Yeah.  It's like you're traipsing verbally.  Well, it seems like that.  And while he was in the closet, he just talked kind of regular.  Well, because I guess they're so paranoid that they want to make sure they sound as straight  as possible.  Yeah.  So when you come out of the closet, you're relieved and you're like, all right, I can  just let it all. 
[01:12:00]  I'm out.  Things are swell.  Right.  Things are great.  I can finally sing.  So Neil Patrick Harris was doing some commentary for the Thanksgiving Day Parade.  And I'm watching.  I'm going, wow.  I never heard him sound so gay before.  What?  So we got a clip here.  And you decide.  What channel got the pleasure of having him?  Couldn't get Punky Brewster.  He actually did a good job.  Did he?  Channel 2, I think.  Describing the colorful balloons coming down the street. 
[01:12:30]  Dave Price's station.  Is that Channel 2?  I don't know.  I can't keep track.  CBS, I believe.  Shut up.  So here's Neil Patrick Harris on the street.  You decide.  Is he sounding a little gayer than he used to?  I say yes.  All right.  Neil Patrick Harris here again.  And you're looking first at a rhino.  And now at two lovely little girls.  What are your names?  Taylor.  And?  Haley.  Taylor and Haley.  Well, you both look super great in your blue outfit.  Super.  There you go.  Super great.  You're a witness.  There's the word. 
[01:13:00]  You look super.  Rest my case, your honor.  You picked out the rhino before the girl.  Right.  What a mo.  It's a rhino.  Ooh, look at the horn.  Oh, children.  Oh, the children are here.  You ever been to a bed and breakfast?  Wonderful.  It's fabulous.  We're all going to have a super time.  Super.  We're going to have some Johnny Cakes.  I got to hear a super again now.  Super.  Yeah.  Taylor.  Taylor and Haley. 
[01:13:30]  Well, you both look super great in your blue outfits.  Blue?  I can't believe that you came out in this weather.  Are you cold?  I came out.  Yeah.  Like a coded message.  Right.  Super blue came out.  Yeah, there's a blue in there.  I had a way of blue when I was in.  I was so depressed.  It's a coded message.  Should we start over and listen for all the codes now?  Yeah, let's see.  Let's hear it.  All right.  Why don't you ring the bell when you hear the coded message? 
[01:14:00]  Coded message.  All right.  All right.  Neil Patrick Harris here again.  You're looking for a rhino.  And now two lovely little girls.  What are your names?  Taylor.  And?  Haley.  Taylor and Haley.  Well, you both look super great in your blue outfits.  Blue.  I can't believe that you came out in this weather.  Are you cold?  Yeah.  Yeah, I bet.  And are you looking forward to getting somewhere warm?  And are you excited to stay all the way to the end of the parade and watch Sam?  Excited end?  Yeah.  And you've got, oh my gosh, it's so windy and crazy. 
[01:14:30]  I can't believe we're out here.  Windy blow.  Jim all excited to play along.  We're just a bunch of creeps.  Don't let's be honest.  We stink.  You've got, oh my gosh, it's so windy and crazy.  I can't believe we're out here.  You are so lucky to be where you are right now, at home or up in the...  Home.  Oh, home.  Oh.  Damn.  All right, well, there you go.  That was lovely.  A little bit of an observation from the parade the other day. 
[01:15:00]  Why did they yank him out of obscurity to be the parade marshal or comment?  Jesus, could they find somebody a little bit more publicly visible?  Oh, the guy was the last thing he did.  He did a...  A guy named Ben.  He did Harold and Kumar.  He was a star in that movie.  There you go.  Looks like he has, like, dried potatoes on his collar.  You want the real Michael Richards apology?  Yeah.  Yeah, this I want to hear, too.  All right.  It's our celebrity break? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, why not?  This is him on, what?  Jesse Jackson's radio show.  Keep Hope Alive.  Keep Hope Alive is the radio show?  Yeah.  That's just got to be a bore fest.  All right.  Yeah.  I'm disappointed in Michael Richards that he had to go on a black show.  He made his apology.  He's doing everything he can.  He's trying so hard to apologize that everything is looking insincere.  He's just...  He's like a groveling, uncomfortable worm.  Yeah.  Say it once.  Stop.  Mean it and just shut your mouth. 
[01:16:00]  Go home.  Go to bed.  Wake up in a month.  He went on a...  I want to make this point again.  He made it...  He made his apology on a huge show.  With Jerry Seinfeld right there.  With Jerry Seinfeld.  Which means the ratings were big.  And then it was picked up by the entire world.  Yeah.  So the black community saw the apology.  So why does he have to do it again on a black show?  I don't get that.  Because the black people told him to.  We have to heal in the community.  You know how they are, Jerry.  You know how they are.  Here we go.  Here's Michael Richards yesterday on Jesse Jackson's radio show. 
[01:16:30]  Michael, now that you've heard the radio version, you've seen the tape, what is your reflection  upon all of this now?  I have been...  I love the delivery.  You will also be seen of all of you.  What's the rationale for this guy's got a radio show?  Holy Jesus.  You can't understand this man. 
[01:17:00]  Michael Richards.  Will you sing to all table, sing to all table, what do you mean?  What?  I don't understand what you're saying.  Will you be doing that bit again?  If I could understand one word coming out of your mouth.  What?  Oh, I'm sorry.  By the way, we're a bunch of dummies.  Doogie Howser has a hit show on CBS.  That's why.  Does he?  I'm glad.  You know what?  I'm glad we don't know that. 
[01:17:30]  Good for us.  What's the name of Neil Patrick Harris' show there, Michael?  Yeah, How I Met Your Mother.  Oh, yeah.  I signed up with it.  How I Met Your Mother?  It is a huge hit, actually.  All right, Michael.  Thank you.  I guess he's got to act.  How I Met Your Mother.  I was f***ing your father.  Is it true he plays a womanizer on that show?  Damn, he's a good actor, huh?  Yeah.  But who could watch that after knowing now?  I know. 
[01:18:00]  You can't watch a Rock Hudson movie anymore.  No, without laughing.  All right, let's get back to her.  Seriously enough, he was buried upside down.  Let's get back to Jesse Jackson's radio show.  What did Jesse Jackson do to become so famous?  All he did was...  All you have to be...  He didn't yell duck in time.  All you have to be is an activist.  And you're in.  You're in for life.  Mr. King, I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but... 
[01:18:30]  Coretta Scott, I don't want to upset you, but...  You know, I told him...  Well, don't go on the balcony.  It's dangerous.  But he didn't listen.  No, that wouldn't be the news.  He'd be like, Mr. and Mrs. Earl Ray, I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but they caught him.  Ah, stupid club soda, Kenny.  I told him.  I don't know why James Earl Ray's parents would be named after his middle name as well. 
[01:19:00]  Mr. Earl Ray.  But stupid Kenny would say that.  Yeah, that's why it works, Jimmy.  He would.  Yeah.  Mr. and Mrs. Earl Ray.  Derek the Dodo.  Mr. and Mrs. King Jr.  Oh, boy, here comes Derek the Dodo.  You know, a lot of people don't notice, but a relative of mine was a Secret Service agent  that told Martin Luther to check out the view from the balcony.  All right.  You ran in for that.  Oh, boy, did he?  He probably stopped in mid-conversation because a gem flashed. 
[01:19:30]  Somebody's still talking right now, and Kenny just ran in.  He was...  Gem alert, gem alert.  He was all the way down the hall.  He started skipping to the studio.  He was excited.  I get to be a racist.  I got it.  Just skipping.  I can't wait to get in here with that comedy gold.  All right.  Here, let's get back to Justin Jackson on the radio show.  Michael, now that you've heard the radio version, you've seen the tape.  What is your reflection upon all of this now? 
[01:20:00]  I have been trying to get to the source of where that anger comes from, Spock.  He's doing the best Shatner impression I've ever heard. 
[01:20:30]  Jesus Christ.  You know he doesn't want to do this.  What a weasel.  Stay out the bushes.  Yes, please, Jesse, everybody.  In the course of doing a show and getting tripped up and using racial language to hurt those  that I felt hurt me.  Warning.  Wow.  Warning.  Using that language to hurt.  And then seeing the pain, of course, that's come from this... 
[01:21:00]  Oh, no, Jerry.  It's Robo Kramer.  The show is over.  I've learned you...  ...are pretty sensitive.  Just screw the whole thing up already.  Enough groveling.  Yeah, no kidding.  Get back to the funny.  Yeah.  Or after the question came, if you went, uh, could you repeat that?  I didn't hear a word you said, boy.  Stupid. 
[01:21:30]  Just how insincere does he sound?  Oh, it's just awful.  I pink.  He's petrified.  That's why he's insincere.  I'm petrified.  Choose each word very.  Carefully.  Just don't say...  Don't say...  Oh, my God.  ...but I'm saying it, aren't I?  I'm saying it right to your face.  I'm telling myself not to say...  ...but I'm saying...  ...I'm sorry for saying...  ...while I'm apologizing for saying... 
[01:22:00]  ...I think I should leave.  You're onto something.  That's why he's slowing down his feet.  Yeah.  Here's what...  Please.  ...I must resist temptation to say...  ...holy...  ...there it goes again.  Jesse, I want to apologize to you and every...  ...out there.  Did I just say...  ...again?  I'm a stupid... 
[01:22:30]  All right, here he...  ...he continues.  I need, you know...  ...to do these stand-up acts.  You know, everyone thinks I'm rich...  ...but hey...  ...gotta eat.  Oh, jeez, I said it again.  Or a quarter is five...  ...I meant nickels.  You know.  I don't want to be out there with a squeegee...  ...like the rest of you. 
[01:23:00]  So I went to the club and said...  ...oh, I did it again.  Oh, God.  You didn't just curse.  You unleashed rage.  Cursing.  Yeah.  The repetition used the word...  ...and then the lynching scene.  I mean...  ...have you been here before?  I mean, how deep is this?  No.  No.  Have you said this before?  Uh...  No.  Liar!  Let me think now.  You're a liar!  Jesse, let me think. 
[01:23:30]  It's one time.  No.  Oh, the pause is great.  I've said coon.  That's count.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Did you ever say this before?  I was...  Hmm.  Huh.  What about eeny, meeny, miny, moe?  Catch a...  ...by the toe?  I used to choose...  We used to choose up sides like that.  If he hollers, let him go.  Eeny, meeny.  No, it doesn't even work there. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, my God.  There's no...  What the hell is wrong with him?  Shut up.  Why doesn't someone tell him...  Jake Kramer, shut up!  Kramer!  Kramer, shut up!  Kramer, you gotta stop apologizing.  You're ruining everything.  I'm trying to sell season seven, Kramer.  Doesn't matter, Jerry.  The...  ...don't buy this.  That's buying Martin and other... 
[01:24:30]  ...shows, Jerry.  Kramer, you're a beloved character, Kramer.  What are you doing?  Just stop talking!  Whatever show you get on, you're screwing up.  I'm not screwing it up, Jerry.  I'm apologizing to the...  ...like I'm supposed to.  Don't get me started again.  Look, there's a...  There's another...  There's a...  ...and a Jew.  Jerry.  How come I can say Jew and not...  ...and a Jew.  All right, let's get back to the apology here... 
[01:25:00]  ...on Jesse Jackson's radio show yesterday.  Before?  Uh...  No.  No, no, no, no.  No, you marble-mouthed...  ...s***.  That's why I'm shattered by it.  The way this came through me was like a...  ...freight train.  And, uh...  You people know about freight trains.  You used to ride them.  The boxcars.  Underground road road.  Oh, wait, no, those were...  ...the underground road.  ...throwing in any racial slur I can. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, just stop already.  Freight train.  And, uh...  ...after it was over, when I went to...  ...look for them, they had gone.  And I've...  ...tried to meet them.  All you...  ...look alike.  I could have been talking to anybody.  I was talking to the valet parking guy.  You know that...  ...scratching my car?  Is this on?  Is this on? 
[01:26:00]  And I've...  ...tried to meet them...  ...to talk to them...  ...to get to some healing and...  Ugh, healing.  Because, um...  ...of the hate.  The hate that came...  ...to the floor...  ...on all sides.  What are you talking about?  He is a babbling...  ...idiot.  What an ass.  The hate that came to the floor...  ...on all sides.  ...to the floor on all sides. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, my God.  It is just...  ...hard to listen to.  He doesn't know how to apologize.  No.  And he's so scared...  ...standing in that room...  ...because I saw the video of this.  It's Jesse sitting down...  ...at the console.  He's at the guest mic...  ...and there are two big black guys...  ...kind of...  ...flanking him.  Yeah.  So he's just...  ...it's like an...  ...Helser Cowie video...  ...beheading video.  They're all ready to just...  ...lop his head up.  They're in bow ties...  ...staring at him.  Yeah, they're just looking at him... 
[01:27:00]  ...and he's...  ...I...  ...said something...  ...very bad.  Right after I said...  ...I said something very bad...  ...oh, that was the bad part?  I didn't...  We got more audio...  ...we'll do in just a minute or two here.  Just embarrassing.  And then we got Paul Mooney.  It was Newman.  Paul Mooney...  Newman hates the...  ...Paul Mooney says...  ...he's not going to use the N-word anymore.  Oh, good for Paul Mooney.  That's nice, but...  ...you know, Pryor kind of took this thing out of it... 
[01:27:30]  ...in 1982...  ...when he said he wasn't going to use it anymore.  Pryor is the one that made it unhip again.  Exactly.  There you go.  So, we'll get into that in just a few minutes here.  Adam Farrar, where are you going to be?  I'm at the Improv in Fort Lauderdale...  ...Wednesday through Sunday.  Just get on stage and yell...  ...it works.  You get plenty of press.  All right.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the Opie.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties. 
[01:28:00]  So, your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the Opie and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction, we want to exploit you.  You can email steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas, or you can just show up during the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving.  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this sh**.  We're in the middle of the Michael Richards audio from the Jesse Jackson radio show, Keep Hope Alive. 
[01:28:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show, by the way.  Keep Hope Alive.  Adam Farrar in studio.  My hubble, hubble, hubble.  And we got Citizen Cope, going to play a quick song for us by the end of this show?  Yes.  It's a fine song.  Very, very cool.  All right.  So, let's get back into this audio.  Back to old Jesse Jackson.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Show an apology by Michael Richel.  What? 
[01:29:00]  Well, here we go.  So, how deep and how long have you had the sense of the radio?  I thought that was you.  I swear, I just thought that was Anthony.  No, that's Jesse.  How deep and how long?  Oh.  Two of them.  Deep and long.  I was still playing that game.  We did it during commercials.  Why not?  Deep and long.  You did it during the Brother P-touch read.  Very nice.  There it is again.  Okay.  So, how deep and how long have you had the sense of rage? 
[01:29:30]  I think for quite a long time.  Not aimed at the African-American.  God, now he has to admit stuff he doesn't even believe.  But not at the African-American community saying.  He's saying it's an anger problem.  It started with Eskimos.  He doesn't believe any of this stuff.  He just feels like this is what everyone needs to hear.  Yeah.  Wow.  So, how long have you had the sense of rage? 
[01:30:00]  I think for quite a long time.  Season three.  Not aimed at the African-American.  Season three.  When I didn't get as much money as Jerry.  I was the one bringing the laughs.  Not Jerry.  But I had to walk around f***ing rich because I didn't have any money in my pocket.  I was driving a f***ing car.  I was made out to be f***ed, Lee. 
[01:30:30]  I was the f*** of that show.  As you and I have spoke, I have said that this rage has no color.  I mean, I know that what I said hit an African-American.  Hit us all because it came out in the open.  And I see it and I will take full responsibility for this.  And promote apology and go for healing. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, white people are finished.  Oh, God.  White people are finished.  We're done.  We've ruled how many years?  Many, many years Whitey has ruled the planet.  The beginning of the end is starting with Kramer.  Who knew?  Who knew Kramer would be the one to crack?  The fact that we are listening to this horse's ass.  Apologize.  Are black people really caring about this?  Do you care whether he's sorry or not?  You know what?  Next week we're going to actually see Michael Richards with rings around his neck and plates in his lips just to apologize more. 
[01:31:30]  Look what I've done for you people.  Look what I've done.  I'm dressed like a regular African.  I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have done that.  It was angry.  Just be a...  Oh, is he awful?  Take the hit and move on.  He's going on a cruise, but he's going to...  He's not getting a suite.  He's going to lay in the bilge the whole time.  Just let me lay here till we get to the Bahamas. 
[01:32:00]  My new name is Mustafa Richards.  I'll probably have to change his name, right?  I'm Kunta, Jerry.  Kunta.  How bad do you think he wants to smash that lady in that had her face in that had the freaking video phone?  Nosy Nelly with her cell phone.  I didn't think they could afford it.  All right.  Well, it continues.  That's not the end of this.  There's more?  Too much love for the African American.  Oh, no.  Too much? 
[01:32:30]  No.  But then you went beyond that, the image of somebody being lynched hanging from a tree.  That went...  I wanted to bring the comedy back.  Into the...  Oh, I shouldn't have said that.  Lynching.  Why not...  You're going to talk about lynching with Jesse Jackson.  Good luck.  Why don't you admit that you go for...  Like, you were angry, and when you try to hit a heckler, the worst thing you could say,  because they violate you on a certain level, and you just went way overboard.  It's the atom bomb.  There's a certain...  I would think... 
[01:33:00]  Now, I'm not a stand-up comic, but Jimmy, I would think as a comic, you're on stage,  you get hit by a heckler, there is a certain level, depending on what the heckler did,  that you answer them with.  It depends on what they do, but you can't go overboard.  Like, one time I got crazy.  I mean, I went nuts.  And I told some guy to...  First, I told him, why don't you keep it down to a dull roar?  Oh.  And then I go, why don't you take a long walk off a short pier?  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Okay.  He must have just punched you in the face.  Nah, get ugly.  I mean, occasionally I'll go like that for the throat, but...  Yeah, you try not to hit that hard right off the bat, you know? 
[01:33:30]  I would think there's certain levels, and then you have your arsenal, and if you want  to equate it to military weaponry, you have a pistol and a rifle and a machine gun, and  you work your way up.  He dropped the atom bomb, but everyone has it in their arsenal.  We all have it.  You all have it.  And we'll all...  Every one of us will use it if we're pushed far out.  Unlike weapons, when the presidents ask what military forces use, would you consider using  nuclear weapons?  They always say, well, we'd like to keep every option open. 
[01:34:00]  No one ever says they're not going to use it.  It's there as a threat.  So he just like, boom, right away, pulled out the A-bomb and mushroom clouded the whole  place, and that was it.  But what, the guy was just noisy?  He didn't attack him?  I think the guy was...  No, no, no.  See, he...  No, he was heckling, but you know...  He heckled, and it's something that Kramer truly believes, that he's not funny anymore,  and that he can't make it on his own without Seinfeld, and that's what the heckler pretty  much...  But also, look at what happened. 
[01:34:30]  He got laughs at the lynching line.  He got laughs at the lynching line.  Yeah.  So he thought, oh, okay, now your mind's running.  He thinks, all right, I'll go with this.  I could take it even further.  And I'm just going to throw the word out, and I'm...  You know, all bets are off.  My Kramer raid.  Yeah.  He was mad that they laughed.  Like, he was trying to be angry, and then when it got a laugh, he realized he didn't  hit hard enough.  I don't think Kramer's mad that people are laughing at his mom's stage, because something  tells me that doesn't happen very often.  I don't...  Oh, you think it scared him?  There's no way he was going for laughs at that point. 
[01:35:00]  No, he had...  He had...  No way.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  He was angry, and he said, like, you ever been arguing with your girlfriend or whatever,  or somebody, and you say something, and they laugh?  Like, you don't want the laugh there?  Like, you don't want the situation diffused?  You want to...  You're angry, and you want to hurt the...  You know, that's...  So, and you punch their teeth down their throat.  Yeah, actually, that's usually the way it starts.  That's what starts the argument.  They disagree politically, the teeth come out, and all of a sudden, you're a bad guy.  I thought I would bar each thing.  All right, look.  That sentence ends with, and that's what happened, officer. 
[01:35:30]  Yes, they're dragging you out.  All right, well, it continues.  Here we go.  Yeah.  That went to the next level.  That feeling, those feelings had to have been thought of for a long time.  No.  No, that's not an image I carry around every day, and every time I look at an African-American,  I think that he should be upside down.  All right, just isolate that.  Wow, that's a way to heal.  Just isolate that.  Wow.  When I see blacks, I don't want them upside down.  All right, well, we're all healed.  I want them upside down.  The image I carry around every day, and every time I look at an African-American. 
[01:36:00]  All right.  And now, here you go.  Wait, I've got to find it, right?  It's right there.  Every day, and every time I look at it.  Oh, shoot.  I've got to get it just right.  You've got to get that clip.  I want it from my machine, too.  Every time I look at an African-American, I think that he should be upside down.  Apology accepted.  That's a ringtone.  Every time I look at an African-American, I think he should be upside down.  Hi.  To my knowledge, they didn't lynch people by their feet. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, what kind of image did he dredge up?  They didn't lynch people by their feet or ankles.  Yes.  Yeah.  I'm mad his racism wasn't accurate.  Come on.  And every time I look at an African-American, I think that he should be upside down.  But he should have a fork up his...  They didn't do that either.  No.  And if you're upside down, the fork would be down, not up.  No one's going to waste their cutlery back then.  It was very hard to come by.  You dyslexus racist.  Dyslexus.  Dyslexus. 
[01:37:00]  Dyslexus, the new car from...  Yes.  It drives backwards when you put it in drives.  Yeah.  No.  All right.  And hung from a tree.  Oh, okay.  Oh, boy.  Way to explain it.  He really went off.  You know, bleeding and in pain.  Yes, after having been whipped in the middle.  Strange fruit.  Every day and every time I look at an African-American, I think that he should be upside down and hung  from a tree.  I have too much love for the African-American.  It's just... 
[01:37:30]  It's not...  It's...  Oh, God.  I tell you...  He couldn't even say it.  That's not a continual image or thought in my mind.  I have too much love for the African-American to imagine him.  I mean, Jerry, I love the...  I love him.  Is that really love for black people when you just don't picture them upside down with a  fork in them?  Lynch.  Yeah.  Is that what the love image is?  Yeah, it's love.  Well, Jesse Jackson asks, are you a racist?  Racists believe all that you said, including the death sentence. 
[01:38:00]  Do you consider yourself a racist?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  But I think anger can go to a place that makes people hate within all kinds of race.  Oh, my God.  What was that sentence?  He's a dope.  All right.  He is an idiot. 
[01:38:30]  He's a dope.  What was that sentence?  Idiot.  And the delivery.  Ugh.  So slow and exact.  Hate.  I can't.  The hate on the floor.  And black people shouldn't be hung trees.  The love I have for the...  I can't say it.  For the... 
[01:39:00]  I love you, d***.  You're smiling, little d***.  I love little ones, big ones, old ones, young ones.  Even ones with chicken pox love d***.  Love you, d***.  Jesus.  All right.  Well, Paul Mooney had a...  That's good.  Continue getting publicity off of this story.  He parlayed this.  He's parlaying.  Of course he is.  Yeah.  I don't think I should ever say that.  He was really excited. 
[01:39:30]  He had to laugh back there.  Size queen.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Being interviewed by everybody.  You were enlightened by Kramer?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pryor didn't do it for you in 80s, but Kramer did in 06.  Kramer.  Well, this is what Paul Mooney had to say.  I don't say that word.  I'm not going to say that word anymore.  Jackson also took issue with blacks using the N-word in songs or in reference to each  other.  Mooney says he's a changed man because of what happened.  Michael has cured me.  He's my Dr. Phil.  Jackson says he's calling on all artists, television, and radio stations not to air the word in any 
[01:40:00]  songs or programs.  Attention.  Calling all.  Calling all.  Please refrain from using the word.  Calling all.  I have an APB out to all.  Do not use the word again.  They're going to rally behind Paul Mooney?  Oh, my God.  Stop.  Radio stations not to air the word in any songs or programs. 
[01:40:30]  He says the word is so steeped in negativity, it only brings pain.  He thanked Richards for acknowledging what he did and for his willingness to get help.  The actor says, I've been a conduit to something that I think is quite meaningful, and the work  begins outside, and the work begins inside.  Bless you.  He doesn't need help.  He's just an ass with anger issues who went too far on a stage. 
[01:41:00]  He doesn't need help.  He needs help.  God almighty.  He doesn't.  Awful.  We are awful.  He needs not to do stand-up.  He's not a stand-up.  That's all.  It just came out.  He's got a tentative grasp on reality to begin with.  He has anger problems.  All right.  Welcome to the club, stupid.  You got 63 million in the bank.  Smile.  Yeah.  No one wants to hear it.  How you need to heal.  You slid on a floor, and you're set for 10 lifetimes.  Die already.  He slid on a floor.  I'm sick and tired of him.  I hate him on that show anyway. 
[01:41:30]  Wacky.  Oh, shut your mouth.  You think it was someone's job to make sure the floor was really wacky?  Of course it was.  You had to wax up the floor right there?  It was a...  He waxed my floor, boy.  It's time for Kramer's entrance.  Make sure the floor is waxed nice.  Get him the new socks.  Those are always slipperier.  When my shoes would stick on the floor when I would slide into Jerry's apartment, it was  an African-American that would have to wax it, and perhaps I should apologize to him. 
[01:42:00]  I treated him badly.  I'd call him, boy, and say, wax that better next time, you, and, and, and, and, and get  me a sandwich, you, and, and then, then there was, and one rarely used his, but then there's  also, and, and, and, and, and, and the worst one of all, what happened when you shared your 
[01:42:30]  cigar with him?  Oh, I called him a, and, and, and, and let's not forget.  And then I hung him upside down and took a fork and, and, and, and, what a dolt.  Just groveling nonsense.  Shut up.  Sticking with the subject at hand, listen to this cute little story.  Now, how do I know that the white people know that we are going to come up with a solution 
[01:43:00]  to the problem?  I know it because they have retina scans, they have what they call racial profiling, DNA banks,  and they're monitoring our people.  Mwah.  Mwah.  Trying to prevent the wrong person from coming up with the one idea.  Is that George Costanza?  And the one idea is how we are going to exterminate white people, because that, in my estimation,  is the only conclusion I have come to.  We have to exterminate white people off of the face of the planet to solve this problem. 
[01:43:30]  This is Malcolm Jamal Warner.  Now, I don't care whether you clap or not, but I'm saying to you that we need to solve this  problem because they are going to kill us, and I will leave on that.  So we have to just set up our own system and stop playing and get very serious and not  be diverted from coming up with a solution to the problem.  Final solution.  And the problem on the planet is white people.  All right. 
[01:44:00]  That was recorded at Bananas Comedy Club.  And, of course, they clap for them, and I guarantee you not one person will walk out.  It's hard to follow the album.  What was that, Nation of Islam?  I have no idea.  It was on C-SPAN.  Yeah, it needed a little setup.  It was on C-SPAN.  It was broadcast on C-SPAN.  No, of course.  Owner of Black...  What is this called?  Black...  Black-nificent.  Black-nificent.  Black-nificent.  Owner of Black-nificent Books says white people should be exterminated.  Well, where is the bookstores saying they won't sell it?  Where's the outcry?  None. 
[01:44:30]  No one cares.  That right there, any black person would come up and say, well, that's freedom of speech.  Yeah.  Come on.  That's freedom of speech.  And he's right.  But what Kramer did is hate speech.  That isn't freedom of speech.  And that's why lawyers and stuff are saying that these two guys can sue because it's hate speech.  It's not protected.  It's not freedom of speech.  What that guy did right there, that's hate speech.  Where's the lawsuit?  Where's the outrage?  Where's anything?  That guy's calling for the extermination of white people in a political forum. 
[01:45:00]  This wasn't a joke.  It wasn't a comedy club.  This guy's calling for the extermination of whitey.  That's much closer to inciting people to riot than some dumb sitcom guy yelling the N-bomb.  That's instructions.  I want that guy on our show to apologize.  It's a white show, right?  I think it is.  Why won't white people call it?  Squeaky white.  White people won't do it, A, because that kind of black guy terrifies white people, and B,  because, again, they have a different standard.  Because blacks, well, that's just what they do. 
[01:45:30]  They're supposed to talk like that.  You don't hold them to the same standard as you do with smarter intellectual people.  That's the way they look at it.  Let's address Mark Quinn from Philly on the instant feedback.  I hope he's kidding.  Uh-oh.  I hope he's kidding.  From Philly, maybe not.  And he's not this stupid.  He might be.  Could be.  Okay, what the F?  Please tell me the censor bleeps on the XM side of the CBS show are just part of the  effing bit.  I thought the XM side was uncensored and clear. 
[01:46:00]  Please address.  It's not uncensored.  XM censors the N-word.  Everyone censors the N-word.  We're not allowed to say that on XM either, sir.  Good point.  Glad you wrote in.  You are a f***ed idiot.  What, yeah?  Your mother should f*** every f*** in this room right now because you are a f***ed idiot.  You can't be that stupid.  Sometimes having the bleep is funnier.  Don't you get it?  And, uh, by the way, do you honestly think that somebody is bleeping this show? 
[01:46:30]  Do you think I could be able to talk over the bleep?  Can that work?  Ant just did a brilliant bit, and this dope thinks that it's being censored by, uh, by XM.  Well, how does he think somebody is sitting there with their finger on a button knowing  when to push it?  When exactly to push it, you a**hole.  See?  Did that go through on XM?  See?  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  The bleep didn't work.  Oh, my lord.  Did you get that on XM, did you?  Jackass.  Nigger face.  Did that go through?  Oh, f***.  Oops.  The beep guy missed it. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, boy.  You missed it again.  You missed the bleep.  You missed the bleep.  Ah, tools.  Let me just say this much.  If Ant did the bit without the bleeps, it wouldn't be as funny.  It's funny because of the bleeps.  We know comedy.  Come on, you jackass.  All right.  Do we have time before we take a break?  You want to sex up the show a little bit?  Ooh.  Jimmy's taking his pants down.  He's bringing sexy back.  I shave it all.  Ooh, nice.  We could all dream. 
[01:47:30]  We could all dream.  Dare to.  Teen sex.  Ongoing problem at movie theaters.  Stop it.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  What's this story from?  1952?  Oh, exactly.  That's kind of in the story.  Jesus Christ.  Kids have always gone to the movies.  That's where you...  Where else are you going to be alone in the dark when you're a kid?  We do have a clip where someone says,  it's not like it was back then.  Uncle Al's?  Back then.  If you're Anne Frank.  The attic.  Again, Anne?  Yeah.  You're laying there having sex in the asbestos. 
[01:48:00]  That Anne Frank was a naughty girl.  She was a fresh one.  Be quiet.  I had to sleep upside down.  Not much of a moaner.  Well, we got a girl ratting out her friends.  She's the lookout.  Ew.  Let's listen to this.  Another disturbing story to tell you about tonight.  You may assume that when you drop your young teenager off at the movie theater,  they're there to watch a movie.  But tonight, Luanne Kahn and the NBC10 investigators bring you a troubling story about sex in the movie theater.  And it's not on the screen. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, and it's not on the screen.  Oh, and it's not on the screen.  May I just tell you, but it's actually in the movie theater.  Now, sex in the movie theater, you know, it's not on the screen.  But they were seeing a porno movie called Blacknificent.  Blacknificent?  Mm-mm.  It's been happening for years.  Yeah.  What do people do in movie theaters?  On the screen.  On the screen.  We started working on this story because of an email from a mom upset.  I started working on this story ten years ago.  I finally have enough info to bring it to you tonight. 
[01:49:00]  It's our award-winning story of sex in movie theaters.  Hoping for the Peabody.  Peabody.  News-breaking.  Teenagers are fooling around in movie theaters?  No.  Stop.  They're also eating popcorn.  Oh, my goodness.  An email from a mom upset her daughter's 14-year-old friends were having sex in the movie theater.  So was your daughter.  First, we found this hard to believe.  And now, after looking into this child's story, we think you should hear it. 
[01:49:30]  We're protecting her identity.  By the way, they're doing this story on the news because it's hot.  It's titillating and it's sweeps.  We learned a long time ago, you put teen in front of anything, it becomes much hotter.  It becomes better for some reason.  Much hotter.  Anything.  Anything.  Try it at home.  Just try ice cream.  Teen ice cream.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See?  Mm-hmm.  That's just a little better.  Uh, rigor mortis. 
[01:50:00]  Teen rigor mortis.  I hate to say it, but it sounds just a little hotter if you think about it.  Exactly.  Oh, you don't want to think it's hotter, but think.  Yeah, better than geriatric rigor mortis.  Teen rigor mortis.  Ah, yes.  All frozen without a lolly in the hand.  Ooh.  You should hear it.  We're protecting her identity.  I go to the movies every Friday and Saturday.  She's just 14 years old, and she tells us what she and her friends see in the theater might be rated PG, but what's going on in the seats can be X-rated. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, I knew it.  My friends are having sex down at the bottom when I sit at the top.  Who wants to bet this is just a fat teenager that can't get action?  Of course it is.  Rating her friends out.  Yeah.  A little tattletale.  She's the fat girl that drove.  So she's going to blow up everyone else's spots.  When she gets popcorn and you have to go and do your own butter, she just opens her mouth under it.  Slob.  Fat slob C-blocker.  All the hot cheerleader.  Ah, forget it. 
[01:51:00]  That a good one.  Oh, God, I had a good one, too.  Go ahead and try that.  No, yeah, right.  Sex down at the bottom when I sit at the top, and they will, like, they'll have me, like, be the lookout.  Like, I'll have to watch the movie, and at the end, they'll say to me, what happened in the movie?  So they can go tell their parents what happened.  Yeah, Fat Broad has to look out.  She is a slob.  They pay for her movie, and they buy her snacks, and that's her job. 
[01:51:30]  Right.  Eating the Twizzlers without even unwrapping them.  Fat, lonely pig.  One night, she had a date, and he cut the bottom out of the popcorn box, and she actually bit it.  The Fat Broad's to look out.  Oh, what a fat tattletale.  Shut up.  Let your friends have fun.  Really?  It's a long way from the good old days when teens made out at the drive-in.  Or tried to get a little...  Do you think that's all that was going on at the drive-in?  Stupid, they were necking in a car alone? 
[01:52:00]  Or hung up in trees with forks.  The good old days.  The good old days, Jerry.  Yeah, that's all that was happening.  Necking.  Where do you think we all came from?  You idiot.  It was teens back in the 50s having sex.  Do you think we were planned?  For the love of God.  They just weren't talking about it like we talk about stuff today.  They make it sound romantic.  No, there was some crazy stuff going on at the drive-in.  Yeah, well, I mean, all the things that I like. 
[01:52:30]  I mean, do you think that girls I know are the first ones that like to be gagged?  Do you think that...  You don't think...  I hate to break this to you folks, but your mother and, God forbid, your grandmother  also like their hair held and like to be made to go...  And have a tear come out of each eye.  And you know what?  Some of them were size queens and some of them like crossed the color barrier.  So Nana might have been in the back of an Edsel with a black friend having her head held  going...  What do you think of that?  That's right.  We're telling you that your grandma's a size queen. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  Oh, Granny's legs akimbo in the back of the Studebaker.  Well, Grandpa pushing her face...  Her face was smooshed against the window as that stupid speaker was hanging over her head.  Her forehead was bumping the cold drive-in speaker.  Well, Grandpa taught her a lesson.  You like Ike?  How about liking this?  Trust me, you won't get pregnant this way.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. 
[01:53:30]  The screen wasn't the only place the blob was.  It froze on her face.  Clued her eyes shut, just like the bowling alley doors.  Oh, God.  The good old days, huh?  Let's listen about the good old days.  It's a long way from the good old days when teens made out at the drive-in.  Good old days.  Trying to get a little frisky in the theater.  These days, we're told when the lights go down, the newest theater seats recline, the armrests go up, and then anything goes, including intercourse. 
[01:54:00]  They're doing both sex and...  She says they avoid movies that are sold out or full of people.  They go to movies that are not R-rated.  They go to J, and they go later at night so that no little kids will be in there.  No one will be in there.  Well, your fest must have been an F-fest.  Try to give someone a good buggering during Borat. 
[01:54:30]  Opening weekend.  Calling all teens.  Go see Pick of Destiny.  Calling all teens.  Go see Happy Feet at 2 in the morning.  And the way she's making it look like the seats go back.  What do you think happened in cars in the 50s, you jackass?  Yeah.  I mean, you're in a car.  No one can see you.  The old cars.  Back seats were like king-sized beds.  The front seats as well didn't have that middle compartment.  No.  It was one big...  Console.  ...freaking seat.  One big hard leather seat.  All right.  Well, unfortunately, we've got to take a break. 
[01:55:00]  We've got a lot more audio, so we could...  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  The good old days.  Oh, my God.  Don't talk about all the way May.  Bert.  Ah, right.  All the way May.  Great aunt.  That's right.  Great in more ways than one.  She was a double-stuffer, as they say.  One wasn't good enough for all the way May.  All the way May liked to have her head hung out the window, too.  Bert and Philly goes, I dare you. 
[01:55:30]  I dare you, Opie.  Throw yourself under the bus again about your great aunt.  All the way May.  Two guys should have driven a silver spike in her back where they met League of Their Own.  What?  League of Their Own.  All the way May.  All the way May, my aunt.  No.  Yeah.  I did not know this.  I have a little fame in my family.  You're kidding.  She was all the way May that I think Madonna played in League of Their Own.  And apparently all the way May liked to have the bottom knocked out of her. 
[01:56:00]  She's a nun in western New York.  Make sure you bring the bat.  She's a nun.  Well into her 90s.  It happens when you've had a lifetime of sex in a few short years.  All right.  You just figure it's over, Johnny.  One gentleman in the car and your head hanging out the window like a Labrador.  While a passerby takes a minute of consoles.  She's a nun.  All the way May.  That's right.  I think I'm going to have to make a change in my behavior.  Well into her 90s.  All the way May's bosoms pressed against the inside of the door. 
[01:56:30]  As her face was pummeled.  Now it's just a distant memory as she doles out clam chowder to homeless people.  There you go.  Is that a Chevy emblem on your forehead, sister?  Sometimes she'll be doling me out clam chowder.  Instinctively she'll just throw it on her back.  She'll be like, why did I do that?  Oh, yeah.  It's my great aunt.  All the way.  All the way May.  Old bleach breath. 
[01:57:00]  He squishes when she sits.  Oh, we got to take a break.  All right.  What a shame.  Citizen Cope is going to wrap up this side of the Opie and Anthony show?  With a fine song.  Nice.  Let's do that next.  Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle all the way.  Whoa, hey.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree.  Only on the Opie and Anthony show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall.  Maybe one near you. 
[01:57:30]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The Opie and Anthony show will bring a busload of homeless degenerate shopping for Christmas presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden Buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless shopping spree on the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  That's right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  By the way, today's football picks sponsored by Dish Network. 
[01:58:00]  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  We have a new leader, by the way.  And Travis is now the leader for that $10,000 that someone's going to win thanks to Dish Network.  Wow, that just scared me.  The music.  Any man stuck behind Travis in a football pick should just shoot themselves.  I have an excuse.  I just kind of do goof picks every week.  Yeah, but the rest of them are just disgraceful.  It was working out for me, but now it's not anymore.  I was only two for five this week. 
[01:58:30]  Citizen Cope.  What's up, man?  Hey, man.  How are you?  How are y'all doing?  Thanks for coming in.  You've got a huge fan right here.  Jim Norton loves you.  My girlfriend, and I never like her to turn me on to music because I just want to Sabbath  her to death.  But one time she's like, you've got to hear this song.  It's a great song.  And it was sideways.  And it really bothers me when I like my girlfriend's music.  But I loved it.  So I was like, we've got to get this guy in.  And I'm sorry it's so late.  But just so you know, Citizen Cope will be at November 20th, 29th at Nokia Theater here  in New York.  Ticketmaster.  Citizen Cope. 
[01:59:00]  What a retard.  Citizen Cope, Jimmy was listening to your CD at a bed and breakfast all weekend long.  Oh, really?  So we had some fun.  Next to the fire and stuff.  That's good.  That's good.  That's a good thing.  Yeah, we like it.  It's like one thing we can agree on is that we enjoy your music.  It's the only thing that bonds us besides from bondage and oral sex.  Bondage, oral sex, and Citizen Cope.  Yeah, the three things.  And bed and breakfasts is all over upstate New York.  Put on sideways and wear the hood.  Well, thank you guys for having me. 
[01:59:30]  It's a pleasure to be here.  Wow, you're pretty soft-spoken.  I'm trying to be.  Yeah?  It's early.  Yeah, okay.  I'll give you that then.  You get a little louder during the day?  Yeah.  And by early evening, you're yelling at people?  Just seems very mellow, man.  Which means we know what's going to happen on stage if he snaps.  Some black people on the balcony chit-chatting.  So what's the name of the CD?  It's called Every Waking Moment.  It came out in September. 
[02:00:00]  And the last record was called the Clarence Greenwood Recordings.  And that's what Sideways is off of.  Cool.  It's a great tune, man.  I really like it.  Thank you, man.  I really didn't want to like anything she liked.  It's just the rebellion I have.  Are you going to do Sideways today?  Yeah, I'm going to do that.  Thanks, man.  Because, you know, she's over there.  Yeah, I brought my girlfriend in because she wanted it.  Yeah.  Thank you.  What is wrong with you, Jimmy?  What?  He's cashing in.  They're loving stuff.  Look what Jimmy did for me.  Bed and breakfast.  He gets guys to come and serenade.  That was nice. 
[02:00:30]  Nothing to offer on a personal level.  Yeah, that's true.  What if there's a guy that can come in here that's actually really good in bed?  Maybe I can help her out like that, too.  I'll continue failing.  Are there any real men out there that can help me out who have done sit-ups?  Oh, man.  You're using this show to, you know, God bless you.  Why not?  This show has destroyed every good thing I've had in the last six years.  I might as well use it to help myself on some level.  You've got something back from it, right?  Some joy.  Spent the night in jail for you people.  I suffered for two years. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Here's Citizen Cope.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  You know, it ain't easy for this all to leave me. 
[02:01:30]  There are no words to describe it.  And friends are in English.  Cause diamonds, they fade.  And flowers, they bloom.  And I'm telling you  These feelings won't go away 
[02:02:00]  They've been knocking me sideways  They've been knocking me out, eh  Wherever you come around me  These feelings won't go away  They've been knocking me sideways  They've been knocking me sideways  They've been knocking me sideways  I keep thinking in a moment that  Time will take them away 
[02:02:30]  But these feelings won't go away  But these feelings won't go away  These feelings won't go away  You know, it ain't easy for this all to leave me  You know, it ain't easy for this all to leave me 
[02:03:00]  There are no words to describe it  I know, it ain't easy for this all to leave me  I know, it ain't easy for this all to leave me  I know, it ain't easy for this all to leave me  Cause diamonds, they fade  And flowers, they bloom  And I'm telling you 
[02:03:30]  These feelings won't go away  They've been knocking me sideways  They've been knocking me out late  Whenever you come around me  These feelings won't go away  They've been knocking me sideways 
[02:04:00]  I keep thinking in a moment that  Time will take them away  But these feelings won't go away  Nice.  Thank you.  Jimmy's in love, man. 
[02:04:30]  Jimmy, you're in love.  What? I'm a nice guy.  You've got moisture in your eyes.  No, it's very good.  No, come on.  So you brought your girlfriend in today.  Yeah, just, you know, I normally wouldn't do that because she sleeps and stuff and she has a drug problem.  But I mean, this morning we want her to come in and, you know, we just both think your stuff.  It's the only, like, music we can agree on.  She likes something and I like something.  It's like, that's how it is in the car.  It's like a constant fight.  You know, we'll put your CD on.  Oh, you ought to put that in your comedy act. 
[02:05:00]  Well, we do a whole thing.  I do a funny bit where, like, we're in the mall and she's got me holding her purse.  LOL.  Yeah, they're going to, like, shut us off the air in a few minutes here.  You want to do one more from the new album or something?  Yeah, the song is called More Than It Seems.  All right, listen, we're going to play out with Citizen Cope because I think they're going to...  If we get cut off, it's because...  The CD, again, it's called Every Wake and Moment.  That's right, and you're playing at...  It's tomorrow and Wednesday, right?  No Key Theater here in New York.  Go to Ticketmaster.com.  I will definitely be there. 
[02:05:30]  I'm probably going to go tomorrow night.  All right, before we do the walkover, once again, here's Citizen Cope.  You're so pure, your heart is full of all I ever need.  I can't take it, I can't speak. 
[02:06:00]  So I'll just sit here and stare.  Yeah, hey, hey, hey, my Eldora.  Let me tell you a story with my hand.  Someone in need  Who now has colors 
[02:06:30]  Surrounding me  You break my silence  Yes, a little bit more than it seems  We can make it outside my dreams  Yeah, it's a little bit more than it seems 
[02:07:00]  We can make it outside my dreams  Oh, my Eldora  They say I don't know ya  But I sure do know  I sure do miss ya  And I can't take it

[02:08:00]  Surrounding me  You break my silence  Yes, a little bit more than it seems  We can make it outside my dreams  Yes, a little bit more than it seems 
[02:08:30]  He's been holding in a cough for like two minutes  I've never watched a singer try not to cough before  He was singing and then he would lean and go  You can just cough in the middle of songs

[02:12:30]  And I just put my hand on her leg  And I reached over and just put my hand on this other girl's leg  And, like, rubbed it  And then went, oh my god  And then I tried to explain it  And just felt like an idiot  It's like one of those stupid teenage things you do  And I feel like a buffoon doing it  I'm an idiot  She's looking at me like  What are you doing?  I was like, oh, fuck  Oh, shit  It's so embarrassing  And you definitely didn't mean to  Dude, didn't mean to  If I did, it would have been like  I tried and I got shot down  Yeah

[02:15:30]  I don't know  I don't know  I don't know  We'll be right back. 
[02:16:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, hi.  There we go.  Ready for action.  Had to sit through that goddamn intro music for a little bit, but look how early we're here.  Oh, wow.  We did good today.  See?  We did good.  Caught all the lights.  We did.  Made all the lights.  Fast trip. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, God.  You know, I'm trying not to read instant feedback as much because there are just a bunch of dopes up there.  It annoys you.  Well, because it's frustrating.  This guy goes, but he doesn't use his real name because he's a pussy, as he calls us a bunch of pussies.  He's some dude from a cell phone.  Cut you off.  You're so full of shit.  I thought you guys could go long if you want.  You had before and got into it with JV and Elvis.  I guess you guys were told not to go long on CBS again, and you're full of, like, a bunch of pussies. 
[02:17:30]  No.  Got us.  We wanted to get out of there, first of all.  Second of all, there are radio stations that are cutting the show off, and there's nothing we can do about it.  Yeah.  JFK in Washington cuts us off at a certain time every day.  I hear they do it in Philly.  In Philly?  Jesse Jackson's show won't even air you.  Right.  Oh, God, these idiots.  I don't curse my beef, by the way.  It seems like it's going to be a biggie today.  Why are they still going after freaking All the Way May? 
[02:18:00]  Enough about All the Way May.  Because she's a goer.  All the Way May?  What's wrong with her?  Everyone knows it.  She's a nun, though, man.  Nothing wrong with that.  She was a really, really good hitter.  So they called her All the Way May.  That's right.  What kind of meat of priest eats on Friday?  Rumor has it Babe Ruth was impressed by her batting skills.  I heard you, Ann.  I'm sure that was it.  I'm sure it wasn't that he was deep-decking her from the back.  Well, she hung out the window, and Lou Gehrig fucking hung both his balls in her mouth, 
[02:18:30]  and she took him and kept talking.  And All the Way May, with her mouth full of cock, she could still whistle.  She slid with her mouth open.  All the Way May.  She gives the luckiest man in the world speech.  And he even echoed when there was no echo.  That was the most impressive part.  May's mouth.  And then there's another guy in instant feedback, James Essone from Foxborough.  See, we'll give you your attention today, James.  Every day he picks a member of the show. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  And he writes, you sound sleepy.  Get more sleep.  Really?  Who is it today?  Well, today it's me, but he's been doing it with you for a while.  I guess that's his way of trying to get to us.  Well, I am a little sleepy.  There's your acknowledgement that you're a human being, you ass.  I am a little sleepy.  Are you?  I was up late.  And four days off like that screws up our sleep schedule.  Our schedule.  Listen, Torrance, he writes, just read my feedback, Ope. 
[02:19:30]  I'm delightful.  All right.  Let's move on.  Let's say hi to Richie in Bayside.  Richie.  Yo.  Hey.  Jimmy, you gave me the douche chill, Jimmy.  That's the song you and her agree with?  What, buddy?  That's it?  That's the band you guys agree with?  Yeah, I like that.  Oh, ow.  You're kidding me.  Well, yeah.  You didn't like it?  I thought it was horrible.  That's not your style.  I think it was fun to see the softer side of Jimmy Norton.  The soft side.  I like to.  That's the one.  I agree. 
[02:20:00]  Look, I want to.  Look, if you're a fan of the show and if you can't understand why that was a good lesson,  then I don't know what to tell you.  I like Jimmy's pretty hardcore and harsh, but you got to see, like, the emotional Jimmy.  Yeah.  You know, Jimmy that has a little love in his heart.  Every bad boy.  If Jimmy was a sitcom.  Will you shut the fuck off so we can perform for you?  Jesus, sir, you really weren't babbling through all of us.  Shit.  Jesus.  Just hold it a second.  Hold your horses.  We used you for a setup and we appreciate that, but you're done. 
[02:20:30]  God almighty.  Oh, my God.  Quiet for a second.  We were going to go off on a 30-minute Let's Beat Up Jimmy bit and this guy has to keep yapping  and yapping and yapping.  It was like we're talking over a music bed.  That wouldn't shut his face.  Poor Adam tried to chime in and talk and emasculate me like the other guys have been doing.  I wasn't.  I was going to say if Jimmy was a sitcom, this would be a very special Norton.  That's what the episode would be.  Right.  You're right.  That's absolutely correct.  This week on Norton.  I did like that, though.  I liked the music. 
[02:21:00]  If I didn't like it, I would have trashed her for it, but I happened to like it.  We enjoyed it in the car.  You really, really got into it.  And you were also very shy.  I was a little shy.  I called him Citizen Kane.  Oh, yeah.  Faggot.  Not only that.  Yeah.  Yes, he did the Rosebud album.  He was really.  But I caught myself.  You did.  Not only that.  I saw that you were trying to look at your girlfriend, but you were a little too shy.  I was shy.  My feet were dangling and clicking my heels together, but I got shy.  Oh, shit.  You didn't want to incur the wrath of the room. 
[02:21:30]  No, I didn't want to look at her as she was staring googly-eyed at the fucking ponytailed  handsome man playing the fucking music that she likes while I sit there and do dick and  fart jokes.  There was a whole thing going on.  Jimmy would really want to look at his girlfriend, but he got a little shy.  No, I wanted to, but I think you were scared.  And I think you had some teary eyeballs.  I'm not sure.  Just a little moisture.  No, they were just open for a while, and that will happen when you're staring.  Maybe that's why you didn't want to look at her.  Or if you're a cock-a-spaniel.  Or if you're a cock-a-spaniel. 
[02:22:00]  Maybe that's why you didn't want to stare at her, because you knew you would just start  being a blubbering ass.  I'm not that emotional.  It's like you were just playing at a funeral.  I mean, it was...  Had I known she was going to scratch his back after and give him googly eyes, I probably  would have had a problem with it.  Someone is trying to say that he's emo.  He's not emo.  Emo.  Is that an emo song?  No.  I don't think so.  I don't think so either.  No, he's very nice.  Anyway.  Can't a man enjoy a softer song without being criticized by listeners?  Nope.  And accused of homosexuality?  You know, playing non-acoustically. 
[02:22:30]  Huh?  I don't know what it sounds like.  They're very mellow, non-acoustically too.  It's not that much different.  There's a couple of musical things that were different in sideways, but not that much.  I mean, it's pretty much that, with just a little bit of stuff behind it.  It's nothing crazy, yeah.  I didn't mind it.  It was okay.  Yeah.  You know.  It doesn't make me want to go to a bed and breakfast, but it was good.  Yeah, I had a good weekend.  It should.  Any Snow Patrol fans in the room?  Snow Patrol?  Ugh.  What is Snow Patrol?  I never heard them.  Oh.  All right.  Why?  Do you and your girl like them?  Snow Patrol is, yeah. 
[02:23:00]  They're blowing up, but I've known them for a few years now.  But now everyone is starting to understand.  Do you and your girl listen, though?  Like, everyone has stuff they listen to with their girl.  Anthony went to a No Doubt concert for his girl.  Yeah.  And her new song stinks, by the way.  Yeah.  It's over for Gwen Stefani.  Even my girlfriend says, you know.  Really?  What's the name of it?  I don't know.  It's Wind Me Up or something like that?  Oh, Travis knows.  Travis, the girl, just gave me a huge thumbs up.  Big feminine thumb up.  He's leading the football pool, though.  How did that happen? 
[02:23:30]  I don't know.  His boyfriend plays.  You want to hear Wind Me Up?  Well, I actually got into Gwen Stefani.  There was one song that you played.  You said your chick had the radio on, and it was a bit you were doing.  Oh, right.  I cranked it in the back, and I was like, I actually went and downloaded it.  Yeah, because I had to take her car into work one day, and it was like, I didn't know  how her car worked or anything, and I was just concentrating on driving, and the radio  was blasting, and I couldn't turn it down.  Wait a minute.  You couldn't turn it down?  You could turn the car into a blender.  Yeah, because I was late, and I was just concentrating on driving without destroying the vehicle. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, that's what happened.  You liked it.  That's what happened.  No, I swear.  You liked it.  I listen to winds on the way in, AM radio news.  Did you scream, ain't holla back, girl?  No, I wasn't screaming, ain't holla back, girl.  Walking in the spotter web.  No, and I wasn't doing any of the old No Doubt songs.  Anthony, were you just a girl?  I wasn't just a girl driving in.  Were you just a girl?  I'm just a girl.  Anthony sings just a girl driving in. 
[02:24:30]  You heard it here first.  You heard it.  What's the new song?  I don't think I do.  Is it bad?  It's called Wind Me Up.  Oh my God, Danny.  Shaved his head.  Yeah.  She's yodeling.  Yodeling shit.  Ew.  She's the Price is Right game.  Stop yodeling.  Stop yodeling.  Stop yodeling.  Oh, this fucking eats my ass. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  This is Swedish house music.  Sucks.  This is abysmal.  Neal Patrick Harris says it's super, though.  It's a little more, then we'll get out of it. 
[02:25:30]  That's crazy.  I've got to hear the yodeling part.  It's one of the rooms at the It's a Small World ride in Disneyland.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  It's not.  We're tanks for nothing.  All right.  Enough. 
[02:26:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  It's really bad.  That was bad.  Yeah.  It's like ice skating on ecstasy.  She gave up on the yodeling.  All right.  That sound that made her popular.  All right.  I'll admit to a song.  You like that?  I kind of like it.  I had one.  All right.  From the American Music Awards.  Which one?  Oh.  One.  And me and my girl both liked the song enough that while we were at the mall.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Confessions.  She bought the CD and I had no problem with the purchase. 
[02:26:30]  What was it?  What was it?  Should I just write it down?  All right.  Yeah.  This was the performance at the American Music Awards was just terrific.  And there was something about this song.  I was like, hey, that's kind of catchy.  You can explain it however you want.  That's kind of catchy.  Kind of catchy.  I don't know how to spell her last name.  Something else is kind of catchy, too.  Well, yeah.  It's going around today, obviously.  Look at Jimmy.  They're going to ask you to do the parade next week. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  So we all have things we listen to with our girl.  What's wrong with that?  It's just, you got to, you know, I mean, all right.  How much?  I used to listen to a lot of bitching, and that's why we're not together anymore.  Oh, Travis was trying to speak?  Oh, Travis, what?  You got the song?  They're still looking for the song?  What's the fucking creep Danny looks like with his head shaved?  Oh, I know.  He's got that shaved head.  What?  Is that the title?  Wow, I don't know.  I don't know that much about it.  Oh, I don't know the title or nothing.  Don't.  Does this song rock?  It was track six. 
[02:27:30]  It can't rock if he's making up this kind of excuse for it.  No, I will be under the bus.  No problem.  I mean, it will be a problem.  But you can't find it?  No, we think we have it.  All right, let me hear it.  How you doing, young lady?  Feeling that you're giving really drives me crazy.  You don't have a player of this.  This is called Promiscuous.  What?  This is about Promiscuous by Nelly Furtado and somebody else.  Oh, wait.  No, that's not it.  Is that right?  God, I wish it was it because that sounds a little cooler because you got a rap dude in there. 
[02:28:00]  That's not that bad, yeah.  No, this is, yeah, it's this song.  Yeah, this song.  Uh-oh.  That song.  Yoli, yoli, yoli, yoli.  I'll listen to the sound effect of a big cock coming out of an ass.  I'll listen to this.  The performance at the American Music Awards, it hooked me in a little bit.  I've got to be honest.  And you're next.  You're next.  With what?  Just maybe a song that you don't really want to admit you like that's kind of recent, I'll think. 
[02:28:30]  Listen to the words.  Oh.  Wait for the hook.  Yeah.  Chorus coming up.  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  Is this Nellie Furtado?  Yeah.  This is a couples only skate.  A couples only.  Yeah, I'm not.  This is not bad.  I'm not feeling it.  But it's not awful.  It's just blech.  I'd love to trash it for it, but.  Honestly, look what she looked like when she was singing at the American Music Awards.  Oh, okay.  You're old, man.  No, look, I, you know, it's going to be tough to make this sound cool. 
[02:29:30]  But look at how she was at the, yeah.  But it's just blech.  It's not bad.  It's a little different.  I can't smash you for it.  It's not like it was fucking Xanadu.  No.  Because I like the song Promiscuous.  Even my girlfriend, my girlfriend's even like, this stinks.  I know, I like this too.  I thought I'd be young and hip.  I know.  I like it from the cell phone commercial with the Spanish chick with her hair up in the  air and the tits running around.  I saw that.  We got a guy that agrees with me.  Please have a deep voice.  Jason, what's up? 
[02:30:00]  Opie, I'm with you, buddy.  I saw her do this live in Times Square.  She was on TRL.  I'm a big fat bastard.  It's 6-4-2-80.  I'm bopping my head back and forth.  I'm with you, man.  It's some school.  That was catchy.  I don't know.  What can I tell you?  It is.  It's all right.  It doesn't always have to be about rock.  You don't understand douche chills until your girlfriend picks up your iPod and looks  at the 25 most played.  Oh, my God.  Do you have it with you?  I certainly don't.  Come on.  No.  It's fucking, the first one is Embryo by Sabbath.  There's a lot of Sabbath in there.  There's some Motorhead. 
[02:30:30]  There's Wind Beneath My Wings by Bette Midler.  There's a fucking, some Kiss.  Top 25 wins, Wind Beneath My Wings.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe it plays a lot while I'm fucking working out.  Oh, God.  I can't help it.  I can't turn it off.  I'm boxing.  I've been with Jimmy at the airport when he just starts singing Betty Davis Eyes because  that's the song that's playing on his iPod.  Is that Top 25?  No, it's not.  That'd be queer.  He'll just yell out like he's singing to horrible songs in the airport. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  No, that's a good song, though.  Now he's in control.  He is my lover.  All right.  Hang out the yes.  All right, Ant.  You want to write?  Let me think.  No, no, because I'm not sure of the name, but I'm sure someone will come up with it.  Is it a newer song?  I think it's 2001, around there somewhere, but it's kind of making a resurgence.  Oh, okay.  Because it's used in that Gears of War commercial.  You ever see the Gears of War commercial?  Oh, yeah, that slow song.  Slow song. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fits the commercial great.  And it's at the end of Donnie Darko.  The end credits.  I know this one.  Oh, look at Danny Nose.  What the hell?  Danny's freaking out.  I don't know.  I don't know what it is.  All right.  Do you know it, Danny?  I got it.  Yeah?  Dan Nose.  Wow.  This one's like really kind of eerie and slow.  Yeah.  But it looks cool.  It doesn't rock, but kind of cool.  The giant spider in the end of the world.  Is this it?  Yeah, I think so.  Got to wait until the, you know. 
[02:32:00]  Listen to the words, man.  Every shock jock has his soft side.  All around me are familiar faces.  Worn out places.  Worn out faces.  You said faces twice.  Bright and early for the daily races.  Going nowhere.  Going nowhere.  Their tears are filling up their glasses.  I don't know. 
[02:32:30]  There's no expression.  No expression.  Citizen Kane.  It's not Citizen Kane.  In my head, I want to drown my sorrow.  No tomorrow.  No tomorrow.  Simon and Garfunkel, The Queer Years?  I'm going to find it kind of funny.  I find it kind of funny.  He's not going to mock my song.  I know.  I actually like it.  It's disingenuous on me anyway.  Gary.  I'm following.  Jules?  Oh, how appropriate. 
[02:33:00]  It's Gary Jules.  Almost glitter.  Yes.  Almost family.  This is an old Tears for Fears song?  Is it?  It's a remake?  What's the name of the song?  Mad World.  Oh, Mad World.  Okay.  This is all right.  Yeah.  Cool.  All right.  You guys two Tears for Fears songs in that movie there.  You ever see Donnie Darko?  Pretty fucking cool.  Watch it and then go, what the fuck was that about? 
[02:33:30]  I hate movies like that.  Yeah, but it's kind of cool in that way.  How many times have you left the theater going, that's it?  What?  What the fuck?  What did I just see?  If the credits start rolling, I'm going to, oh, fuck.  What was that movie that was out a few years ago and it ended and everyone just got up  and said, bullshit.  They got so pissed off.  What movie was it?  I can't remember.  But the whole, I think it was one of those.  Was it Pirates of the Caribbean?  Because he said they did part three.  No, it was Shalom, Shalomama, Shalomama, Ding Dong.  Oh, yeah.  M.I.  M.I.  M.I.  Stinks now. 
[02:34:00]  What movie was it?  The Village?  Was it The Broad in the Water?  The Village.  I think it might have been The Village.  Yeah.  At the end of The Village, everyone stood up like, yeah.  Oh, good.  They got so pissed off as they're leaving the theater.  He stinks.  The original is gay, according to Danny, of Mad World.  Oh.  Yeah, let's hear it.  How close is it?  Oh, gay already.  Wow.  That noise is actually an IV drip.  Oh, boy. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  That guy made that song a lot cooler, huh?  Yeah.  I would never listen to this.  Nah.  What year was the remake done?  You know what year the remake was done?  2002?  All right, it's, uh...  Only Darker came out in 2001.  How the hell's that possible?  No, you know.  That's kind of cool.  Hey, Danny has a short clip of the bit with it in his girlfriend's car if you want to go 
[02:35:00]  to break with it.  Is it good?  Does it need a setup?  I guess it's pretty much...  Yeah, pretty much set it up.  I'm trapped in a car with music I didn't like.  Your car didn't work and you didn't know how to turn her radio off.  And I was late.  Yeah, but this song, you got turned on to this song, actually.  I was very happy.  And I had to get gas.  I did not.  I got turned on to it.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, I liked it.  Of course you did.  All right, we got it.  We'll go to break with this.  Okay.  Now, I'm on the expressway.  You honestly couldn't figure out where the volume controls are?  I couldn't figure out. 
[02:35:30]  It's like the glass cockpit of a brand new fighter jet.  There's no knobs.  There's no nothing.  It's all touchscreen, glass screen thing.  Oh, yeah.  This thing is like the future.  I'm surprised it doesn't fly.  Oh, sorry.  Not loud enough.  It was blasting and I couldn't turn it down.  And there I am.  Hey, here I am driving down the expressway.  How do I turn this down?  How do I turn it down? 
[02:36:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm freezing.  Oh, stop.  I can't take it.  I'm freezing cold.  One thing I did hear, though.  Low fuel.  Low fuel.  What?  What?  My mule? 
[02:36:30]  What are you saying, vehicle?  I don't understand you.  Low fuel.  Low fuel.  I wish I could listen to 1010 winds so I know what's going on for the show.  But I got to hear Gwen Stefani on 11.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  This is my drive in.  Oh, it's only quarter to five in the morning. 
[02:37:00]  I like listening to loud dance music at a quarter to five in the morning.  Stop.  Stop, please.  Stop.  The Opie and Anthony Program.  Or that stupid XM stinger they do.  What is it?  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  XM 202.  Rock and roll, rock and roll. 
[02:37:30]  Adam Farrar in studio, playing Fort Lauderdale.  Fort Lauderdale Landfraud.  Good room.  Yeah, it's fun.  You been to Jim?  Yeah, a long time ago.  Nice.  Hey, we've got to get to Patrice calling Hannity and Combs racist.  He was good on Hannity and Combs.  Yeah.  I watched his segment.  Saw it.  Very good.  Well, now he should do it instead of the Heather Mills.  What's about Heather Mills?  It's just always enjoyable when we get Heather Mills' audio.  It certainly is.  She was on Extra about a week ago. 
[02:38:00]  Isn't that funny?  She's on Extra.  I know.  She doesn't even have enough.  She was hopping mad.  No, yeah, it was a feature on Left Shoes.  Former KGB agent.  They just show that creep again.  Sometimes there is poison in fish.  Just happens in that.  There he is again.  Look, there he is again.  Yeah.  Just goodbye, Goldfinger.  Poor guy.  It's like that Yul Brynner commercial.  Oh, I know.  I'm dead now.  The poor guy. 
[02:38:30]  Was he bald before?  No.  No.  He had pictures of him.  He was a young, dashing man.  Full hair and everything.  How long did the poison take?  Fucking that's quick.  A couple of weeks.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Gave him a good poisoning.  Oh, yeah.  He sure did.  Where did he get it from?  Do we know?  Yeah, sushi.  Sushi.  Eh, it happens.  Radio acting.  Don't eat blowfish.  It's the Heather Mills you've never met.  I'm a good mother.  I'm a good person.  You know.  Let's see your job.  I fell in love for the right reasons.  I loved unconditionally.  And it just didn't work out. 
[02:39:00]  A complete 180 from the woman who's been persecuted in the press.  If I was a gold digger, I would have a lot of money in my bank account.  A woman who, after losing her leg in a tragic accident, has suffered more than most can  ever imagine.  What?  What are you talking about?  By having Beatle money?  Wow.  Where's the suffering?  Gee, sorry.  The fucking front man for the Beatles didn't want his wife shitting into a bedpan.  Gee, I don't know why he wouldn't want that.  He's fucking British royalty.  He wrote yesterday, and he doesn't want the hole he's been fucking to shit into a bedpan. 
[02:39:30]  He's already got to pretend she has two legs.  God almighty.  Isn't that enough acceptance?  Isn't that enough acceptance?  Yes.  Jesus Christ.  You have one leg, and you landed a Beatle, and that's not good enough.  You have to shit in bed, lazy.  Wait, what's the shit in bed story again?  I remember that was part of the allegations, but I forgot the circumstance.  She said he was so mean because he wouldn't get her a bedpan because it hurt her leg to  get up and go to the bathroom in the middle of the night.  So she wants to fucking have a bedpan under the bed. 
[02:40:00]  Wait, she wasn't even sick?  Oh, I don't know.  She had to have a leg operation.  She wanted to shit in the bed.  Okay, all right.  Whatever she wanted to do.  And fucking Sir Paul didn't want that, sir.  See, there's things you do.  Sir Paul, get your own fucking bed.  See, this is the deal.  We talk about this from time to time.  There's things you do in your relationship where there's no turning back if you decide  it's okay to do such and such.  One of those would be shitting in bed.  Shitting in the bed.  How do you have a romantic relationship after that with the bedpan?  There's no Citizen Cope song going to take that away.  No, there isn't. 
[02:40:30]  You turn over to look at her and she's fucking grunting and her forehead is sweating.  I'm sorry, love.  Well, she's suffering enough.  I know she has.  Did you fart?  No.  Let's see where this goes.  That time in your life, that courtship you said was worse than when you lost your leg.  Oh, yeah.  I would rather someone come up and chop all my limbs off than go through what I went  through.  Stay still.  Only facts.  Because if your limbs are chopped off, you go, okay, you get another limb, there's light  at the end of the tunnel.  When you're vilified for doing nothing but fall in love with an icon, nothing, what have 
[02:41:00]  I done?  What is my crime?  Nothing.  I'd rather someone chop all my limbs off.  And that's what God's honest to you.  Is it the God's honest to you?  It's not true.  Then be married to Paul.  How is she being vilified?  She's raping him for money.  Yeah.  What did I do?  You're raping a beetle for money.  Jesus.  So now it's going to get ugly.  What do you think?  He had no prenup, right?  What a dope.  He deserves to be taken to the cleaners.  He knocked her up, had a kid with her, and he has no prenup.  You should call Maxwell Silver Hammerman to come down on the head. 
[02:41:30]  What a fool he is.  And she was the one that didn't want him smoking pot.  You're telling a beetle he can't smoke pot anymore.  It hurts his creativity, I suppose.  Fucking.  Yeah, a little something called Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  God, he's got a fucking...  He deserves it.  That's what you get.  You marry a one-legged hooker and don't sign a prenup.  How do you get to be Paul McCartney and not have a prenup agreement?  Didn't you learn anything from Yoko?  I don't know.  No.  No kidding.  By the way, we missed a line. 
[02:42:00]  Chester's Liver from Whack Bag.  It's the Heather Mills you never met.  Ah, must be the two-legged one.  Oh.  That's not, by the way, the truth.  She wouldn't rather lose three limbs than have gone through that.  She's just lying.  Yeah.  Someone should test her.  I'd love someone to test her.  That'd be just awesome.  Get a saw out.  Oh.  She's just a truncated, cranky ex-hooker.  Old cello body.  Wait, whatever happened with that?  Did they ever prove anything with that?  No.  Oh, Adnan Khashoggi claims he fucked her.  Or her secretary claims he gave her 11 grand for a fuck. 
[02:42:30]  11 grand?  Yeah.  Adnan Khashoggi?  Adnan Khashoggi is the one, the arms dealer.  Yeah, right.  And her secretary said, uh, I paid her for sex with Adnan, and she denied it, and he  goes, well, no, she's lying.  I handed her the money.  Oof.  It sounded very believable to me.  Yeah.  So, according to him, she was an ex-prostitute.  Arms dealers don't lie, though.  Why would they?  You guys admit he deals fucking mass murder weapons.  Yeah.  Arms dealer.  Yeah.  Always, still makes me laugh.  Yeah, well. 
[02:43:00]  She didn't quite need an arms dealer.  Yeah.  She read the ad wrong.  Is there anything in the back?  You know, legs dealer, please.  Here we go, the last clip from Heather Mills.  And contrary to the picture painted in the papers, Heather Mills is funny.  Yep, funny.  I'm sitting on the chairlift, and I'm going up there, and I think, oh, this is just so  amazing.  I'm going to learn to ski again.  And I think, my left leg is really light.  And then I go, oh, my God.  And my leg's just flying down the mountain.  And this snowboarder's like, hey, dude, what's that? 
[02:43:30]  It's coming down after him.  Liar.  And what's funny about that?  Yeah.  Dude, liar.  That's funny.  Let's see.  I get heckled at the laugh.  I've done a lot of skiing.  It's impossible to lose a leg if you're in the snow pants and stuff.  Well, hers comes off.  The snow pants?  It would stay in the snow pants.  It would.  You would think, yeah.  Yeah.  Unless Paul tried to beat her with it.  Yeah, he pulled it.  It'd be great if he pulled one of her legs out and kicked her in the ass as she was leaving  the house.  Like, with her own foot.  Get out, you bitch. 
[02:44:00]  Fucking awful Lieutenant Dan leg.  Silver with a sneaker on it.  That's the latest.  Magic legs.  Like that scene in Jaws where the leg just floats down?  Yeah.  By the way, in case you missed it earlier, we played the exclusive, well, it's not really  exclusive now, is it?  Michael Richards' apology.  In case you missed it from earlier this morning, this is what he had to say on Jesse Jackson.  Anyway, I, uh, I just want to say that I'm sorry.  I, uh, I lost my temper and I probably shouldn't have. 
[02:44:30]  I took it out on you and, look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior,  well then, I'm sorry.  I apologize.  Even though you know, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it.  I mean, who's kidding who?  Well, they tell me that you're very upset and, God forbid, I should disturb the very important  monkey.  I'm just hoping we can put this together.  Let's just move on with our lives, okay?  So, there you go.  Kramer on, uh, Jesse Jackson yesterday. 
[02:45:00]  A little more natural in his speech, but not quite as sincere.  A little more comfortable there.  Maybe somebody should fucking script out an apology and that horse's ass can act it out.  That's what they should have done.  And then just do it like it's a Seinfeld episode.  Do him an entrance, let him...  Yeah, let him slide into the, uh, studio.  What was that episode about?  Why was he apologizing to a monkey?  I know I'm missing a...  It's from a movie.  Yeah, a monkey's from...  Hey, why are you tearing down the seventh wall, Jimmy?  What?  Uh, he went to the zoo, and the monkey was mad at him, and he spends the rest of the, 
[02:45:30]  um, episode trying to apologize to the monkey.  Oh, I'm sorry.  And make the monkey like him again.  I stand corrected, James.  Am I right?  You rock?  Sure.  Give me that.  What is it, Oop?  Probably money.  It's probably money.  Oop just got handed a big envelope.  Big envelope.  Oh, great.  Thanks.  I gotta walk home, you know.  Jesus.  Uh, well, Patrice was on Hannity and Combs talking about, uh, Kramer.  Yeah.  Our buddy, Patrice.  Joining us on, Santa Comedian, frequently heard on the Opie and Anthony radio show, Patrice  O'Neill, and the comedian who performed prior to Michael Richards last Friday, Suley McCullough. 
[02:46:00]  Suley, what was going on there when you were there?  Tell us what you saw.  Uh, I'm still trying to figure it out.  It was ugly.  Uh, you know, all the comics were upstairs watching, and then it took a turn for the  worst.  And I've seen comics bomb over the years, but that was something else.  What do you think he was thinking?  Uh, I think he was thinking, how can I stop myself from talking?  Uh, even an insult comic isn't gonna say those things, you know what I mean?  I think he just had an out-of-body experience and couldn't, you know, once it was done,  he wished he could clean it up. 
[02:46:30]  I mean, everybody was shocked here.  We didn't, you know, I've been here for a regular here for a while, and I've never seen  anything like that.  Who's Suley?  Suley?  What is he saying?  Out-of-body experience.  At least Patrice, like, puts it in terms people can understand.  Patrice is honest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He said it.  He didn't think anyone had a stupid video camera, phone, or whatever, and...  Patrice is not outraged.  No.  He doesn't care.  No.  All right, here's Patrice weighing in.  If you listen closely, you can hear Patrice tell Suley to shut the fuck up. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, shut up.  It's hysterical.  Patrice, we're looking at the apology here, and you're not too satisfied with that apology.  You don't think that came from the heart?  No, he looked like a terrorist hostage, man.  He didn't even, he's socially in that.  But what would he have to do at this point to...  Can he, can this all be fixed fixed in any way?  No, the apology, I didn't think he was so bad until he apologized.  Why?  Look, man, when you...  Maybe he needs to go on BET.  What'd you say?  Shut up.  I said maybe he needs to go on BET. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, well, I don't think it was a little bit of a...  No, first of all, we didn't see the whole tape.  Second of all, when you're a comic, if somebody is annoying you, and the only thing you got  to defend yourself against that anger is to call them what they are.  Like if an Indian dude was heckling me, I'm just going to call him some type of goofy Indian  word, but I'm not saying that that word is goofy, but it's goofy in the mouth of Kramer.  Are you saying he should have said nothing?  He should have lied and said he was doing some kind of conceptual thing that he used to do 
[02:48:00]  on Friday.  He's a goofy guy.  And that would have solved the problem.  But now we're having some, this is a racially charged situation, because Cosmo, the dude  that slides into Cycle's house is now having us talk about race.  And another thing about race, it's race has become a thing between you two guys, like where  the concise, meaning the perceived racist and the perceived not.  But you're just two white guys to me. 
[02:48:30]  You should let black people run racism.  When Mel Gibson said what he said, when the godfather said what he said, when, when, uh,  let me ask you this.  It's just, we run it ourselves.  This is.  He is so right.  Yeah.  He's right.  That's it.  He's right.  Absolutely.  I mean, that, that is a nutty, insane rant.  Come on.  Oh, he was sick.  Well, yeah, I mean, he was sick.  You're white.  Oh.  You're all racial.  If white people don't admit that they're racial, we can't have these conversations, because 
[02:49:00]  you're going, who, me?  You never had that word in your head ever, Sean?  Do you have that word in your head?  Do you use that on stage?  I use it when I wake up.  Is there a difference, though?  I mean, why, is there a line that you don't cross?  For example, when he says that, I feel like I'm listening to Robert Byrd, a Klansman.  I, look at, I want, and this is for real, I want white people to be able to say anything  they want so that I can say anything I want.  That word does not have the power it had in 1968. 
[02:49:30]  You don't think that's over the line?  You don't think that's over the line?  Nope, because I want to be even more over the line if I can.  Do you really believe Sean Hannity's never thought that word up?  Never thought the word he's had at all.  Not even during a football game, somebody drops a pass?  How can you not?  Of course.  People are just not honest.  And not honest.  No one wants to be honest about race.  And not honest.  White people aren't honest about race.  That guy who wants to exterminate white people, you know what?  At least he's honest.  That guy's honest about race.  You can't vilify people for being honest about race.  And he's right.  Black people would be better off if all white people were dead. 
[02:50:00]  Give me a, oh boy.  Ring that bell, please.  Oh boy, that would have been a.  Oh, I have a doozy.  Sure you did.  Oh, I had a doozy.  That's wise.  Because I thought of what they'd be doing if all white people were dead.  Oh boy.  And it may not be what a lot of people are thinking.  You better hit that again.  Yep.  All right.  Thank you.  I'm not defending the dude.  I'm saying that, like, at least it's out.  Like, just because you put on a piece of paper and white people are now trying to socially  edit themselves, it's still there. 
[02:50:30]  People, no, I disagree.  People don't think like that.  People don't act like that.  Are you serious?  Are you out your mind?  Are you out your mind?  God bless Patrice.  Yep.  A little bit of honesty there on Fox News Channel.  Yeah, because Sean Hannity has to play, you know, a role.  Yeah.  Like anyone else.  Are you serious?  Are you serious?  No, no.  Is he serious?  Do you think white people think like that?  Of course they do.  All people, not all, but you take polls. 
[02:51:00]  When you take polls, does that mean everybody will think like that?  You said if 100 people have 90 people say that.  You know what I'm saying?  90 people don't think like that.  Maybe two out of 100.  Two out of 100.  Where are you doing your studies, Sean?  I don't know.  Two out of 100, what?  Two out of 100 would, like, think like that at some point in their life.  Wow.  Wow, that's not true.  That's not being informed.  That's out of touch.  No, that's 99% of white people think like that at one point or another in their life. 
[02:51:30]  And just like the majority of black people think of it towards white people, towards Chinese.  Of course.  What do you think black people in the hood think when they're having a problem in the Korean deli or the Chinese food?  You fucking gook.  They're not thinking, hey, excuse me, service person, industry worker, could you please?  But they are thinking racist.  And the Asians thinking racist because they're thinking the black person's going to be stealing something.  Yeah.  And they, you know, it's, you know, the animal kingdom we live in.  It's not nice, but it's a reality.  Sean really thinks only two out of 100. 
[02:52:00]  Two out of 100.  Two out of 100 white people.  It's got to be 98 out of 100.  Yeah.  And you don't think it all the time.  It just comes out in moments of anger like it does for everyone else.  It's not like you're on a mission.  Like he said he felt like he was listening to a Klansman speech.  They're on a mission.  Their thought process is constantly devoted to that.  They get up and give speeches.  And that's different than every so often getting pissed off and dropping the A-bomb, you know, especially to yourself.  That happens a lot.  Yeah, but you can have racial awareness without going to that word. 
[02:52:30]  I mean, you can have like.  No, you don't just go.  You don't.  If you're cut off by a black guy in a car, you get cut off.  I mean, where you almost kill yourself.  Right.  You don't think, hey, black gentleman.  Hey, you African man.  You look at the color and the N-word pops right in your fucking head.  If he has a nicer car than me, absolutely.  Yeah.  Well, that too.  It's probably stolen.  And if you don't think it.  Oh, my God.  And if you don't think it or you don't say it, it's because you make an effort to not think it. 
[02:53:00]  Like if you.  Yeah, now you're trying.  It's like.  But 98 out of 100 are thinking it.  Come on.  Just because you know it's awful.  You're thinking it.  Okay.  So should you be commended for making the effort of not to go there?  No, it's not being honest with yourself.  Look, when we have to make efforts.  Like you don't always call women a cunt when you get mad at your girlfriend.  You might want.  I'm sure you've all wanted to say cunt before.  I never have.  But I mean, I'm sure everybody else has wanted to at one point.  And you don't because you edit yourself.  And you should edit yourself.  Yeah.  I mean, there's a social etiquette we have.  You should edit yourself.  You suppose.  Of course you are.  No one's brutally honest.  I mean, you know what?  If a cop pulls you over, you don't just go, you fucking pig. 
[02:53:30]  You want to because you're angry he pulled you over.  But you don't.  You can't edit your own mind, though.  Yeah.  What pops in your head, if you try to edit that, you're just being dishonest with yourself.  Yeah.  Or you can scold yourself for it.  But to say that that never pops up.  Yeah.  Like Hannity saying the thought never came to his head.  And he's never had the word nigger come through his head and think, you know, during some type of situation where it would.  You know, I mean, he's being dishonest. 
[02:54:00]  He listens to us every morning.  Is he around?  We should try to get him on.  Well, like when I heard about Little Darryl Little John, I don't know if he's guilty or not.  The black bouncer that apparently killed that girl.  Right.  That's the allegations.  That was the first thing I thought of.  And had he been white and the girl been black, whatever the most awful racial thing a black guy could think of, that's the first thing he would have thought.  I mean, it's just a reality.  It's what we think of.  Yeah.  It doesn't make it right, but it is what it is.  All right.  Let's go back to Patrice.  Where are you doing your studies, Tom?  Look, I don't know people like that. 
[02:54:30]  If the white guy heckled you, would you start using epithets against a white guy?  Would you do that?  Here's what he did.  That was the lowest.  He lost because he went there.  I have gone there before.  You have.  Of course I've gone there before.  If a lady would still go there.  Okay, well, you've still gone there.  Who the hell is this Sully guy?  Oh, Sully, he's a comedian from L.A.  He never goes there.  He's trying to pipe into this interview and he's just getting pushed to the side. 
[02:55:00]  Because it's like Patrice is just being brutally honest about the way he feels.  He's not trying to sugarcoat it or find a solution.  He's just telling you the truth.  If a lady would still go there.  Of course.  If you go to how much money you have.  Hang on, Sully.  Go ahead.  If you go to how much money you have and how racist you are, then you've lost the game.  Are you racist then if you go there?  He did not have control.  I hope so.  You want to be racist?  Are you kidding me?  I'll be so proud.  I'm mad at white people because you haven't told me how much fun it was all these years. 
[02:55:30]  God, he brings some funny, man.  Here's the thing about Patrice.  The same thing that makes him the fucking good comic that he is is the same reason he  has two friends.  Yeah.  No one likes him.  Because that's how he is.  He's completely...  I would not like that honesty.  He's a very honest guy and that's the truth what he was telling.  He was right and he was telling the truth.  This clip could be pretty good.  You guys are so...  White people, you know what I mean, Sean. 
[02:56:00]  What does that mean, you white people?  Oh, my God.  You can't have these arguments.  Is that Michael Richards, are you a favorite if you want to do what he does?  Michael Richards didn't do me a favor.  He did his career in justice.  But this is a great...  And now, I tell you what y'all should fight for, get rid of cell phones.  Because that's messing y'all up.  Is it racism morally repugnant to you or no?  Of course it is.  But, okay, is it more morally repugnant to be it or morally repugnant to...  How about both? 
[02:56:30]  By the way, someone brings it up on Instant Feedback.  Can't take credit for this.  I bet you Sean Haney's thinking the word right now.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Could you let me get a word in edgewise?  I have an argument with Patrice.  If you don't think it, there's something wrong with you.  Hook you mouthy.  Someone from their cell phone, they didn't leave their name on the Instant Feedback.  Very good observation.  Patrice was being uppity.  Morally repugnant to be it or morally repugnant to get caught being it?  Oh, Bob, I would say to be it.  And you are, you are. 
[02:57:00]  But just because someone says that you are not to be one and you can't frivolously be  one anymore...  We'll be listening to an opiate answer.  Oh, Sean, you're going to cut me off like that?  Only a one-hour show.  Thank you, guys.  I'll see you later.  Coming up, UCLA.  The mass is putting you out of the house, into the field.  Well, first of all, they should have after that dope attempted to say frivolous and tripped  on it.  Frivolous.  Frivolous.  Frivolous.  I've never heard Patrice.  I've known Patrice for 10 years.  I've never heard him say frivolously.  Frivolously.  That's a white person word, Patrice. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, stop it.  Black people don't say frivolously.  Redding from Whackbag.  Yes, I did say Patrice brings the funny.  Oh, I wanted that one back.  I did hear you say it.  I wanted that one back.  And it was either ignore it or bite them.  In a funny briefcase.  Does he put it in a briefcase of comedy?  Opens it up.  I'm bringing the funny.  Here comes some funny.  I got the chips, the dip.  What are you bringing?  As soon as I said it, not even a pause looked at all you guys like, oh, shit.  That's right.  What an ass. 
[02:58:00]  What happens?  Russ in Ohio.  Russ?  Hey, Hannity's full of shit, I think.  He used to be a construction worker.  And I don't know a construction worker that's never dropped the N-bomb.  Oh, my God.  I think what, look, if Hannity.  Comes right after hand me the hammer.  Or you're late again.  If Hannity's saying that most people don't walk around constantly thinking, like Michael  Richard yelling nigger on stage, most people don't walk around thinking like that  all the time.  And if you have a moment with a black person where you're annoyed, you don't automatically  go to that.  I don't think that's, I mean, if he's saying that we don't all walk around thinking that, 
[02:58:30]  he's right.  We don't.  But in a moment like that, it's just the lowest, angriest point you can go to.  Mentally, most of us go there even though we don't want to.  Basic human nature to want to conquer, to want to come out victorious if you're in some  kind of a situation.  So even if it's just a thought situation, like I said, the cutting off or someone, you  know, getting into an argument with you, it's going to be in your head.  Intensely threatened situation is going to come out. 
[02:59:00]  It's going to be in your head.  Like, you know, and you always bring up the most morbid, horrible thing that could happen.  Let's say, God forbid, something horrible happened to one of Sean's family members and  an African-American gentleman was the perpetrator.  You don't think that word would at least come into your head if not being blurted out every  three seconds as hard as you, loud as you could in your house.  It would be in the deposition.  Yeah, and in the courtroom and everywhere else. 
[02:59:30]  It just, it's the way it is.  We're just animals.  We're people, human beings.  Yeah, but that stress level is a little bit different than the late show with the laugh  fact.  No, it's not.  Have you ever done it?  Yes, sir.  That fucking, that, I can't stand that room.  They love that happy, fucking fun, high energy nonsense.  Those people put six shots into his act and he saw it die in front of him.  That was a loved one to him.  Let's go to Robert in Texas. 
[03:00:00]  Robert.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I wonder what side of the fence Robert's on.  Yeah, no kidding.  Yeah, you know, come on.  Anyway, no, a typical, to me, a typical thought process, Spike Lee put out a movie back in  the 80s, late 80s.  Do the right thing.  And for anybody to stand there and say that that's not honestly the way that, you know,  our social commentary is, even nowadays, you know, that, you know, they're living in a  blind closet, honestly.  Well, Spike is, I like, I love Spike Lee, man. 
[03:00:30]  I think he's really honest.  I mean, I like his movies.  It makes Italians look bad, his movies.  Good.  Puts them in an inaccurate, poor light.  We don't run around saying those horrible words to each other when we're alone together  as just Italians.  He makes a fucking great point.  He paints Italians as a bunch of fucking hateful pizza makers, and that's why I love  Spike Lee.  Cops are all racist, and Italians are all fucking Guinea pizza makers.  What I meant was they didn't put the word in enough for Italians. 
[03:01:00]  He made them look too pleasant and accepting.  Dishonest.  Ladies and gentlemen, Sean Hannity.  Sean.  Hey.  Hi, Sean.  What's up?  You guys don't mind I steal on your guest, do you?  Not at all.  Not at all.  No, you got the plugs in.  That's all we care about.  By the way, he was very funny.  He was very entertaining.  Patrice is a riot, man.  We love Patrice.  You know, although I've got to be honest, there was a moment there, you know, I was like,  man, who cares?  And I think the whole studio, like, you could hear a pin drop.  Yeah.  Well, he doesn't give you the typical black guy answer. 
[03:01:30]  Patrice is very honest.  He doesn't play, like Sully to me was giving the typical, you know, answer, whereas Patrice  was coming from a different angle going, it didn't bother me.  Who cares?  Yeah.  And I think Patrice was right.  Some jackass from a sitcom had dirty talk and the whole country's up in arms about it.  And a lot of black guys, especially the L.A. crowd, they don't want to face it honestly.  And I think Patrice did a good job of interpreting what happened very honestly.  I think he really, in terms of just a pure debate, putting aside what view you're on, 
[03:02:00]  I think he smoked the other guy he was debating pretty good.  Oh, Sully stunk.  Hey, Sean, your numbers seem way off.  Two out of a hundred?  What did you mean by, like, think like that?  Did you have to, let me just interpret how you meant.  What was the quote?  I forgot what it said.  I believe Patrice O'Neill was saying that if you're white, that thought has at least  crossed your mind at some point.  The same type of, not the same type of tirade that Michael Richards had, but the thought,  that racist thinking mindset, depending on what situation you're in, has come across 
[03:02:30]  at some point, and you at one point said, no, it's got to be more like two out of a hundred  people would think like that.  I don't know anybody that thinks like that.  Honestly, I don't, do people think in those terms, are there people?  Sure, but I think that's the small minority of people.  Look, there's black on white racism, white on black racism.  People think that, people say that, but look, it's not even politically, it's not acceptable,  rightly so in society anymore, to be that way.  I'm just thinking this way, when Patrice asked you, have you ever thought that word, he put 
[03:03:00]  it right to you, and you said, no, I think that's dishonest.  I think at least, in certain situations, just being a human being, and of course, it has  been rumored that Sean is superhuman, but being a human being, you're put in a certain  situation where your basic primal animal instinct comes out, where you want to use the biggest 
[03:03:30]  weapon in your arsenal, and I'm not talking about blurting it out, I'm talking about you  get cut off on the highway, and an African-American gentleman almost put you into a wall.  That thought, the word, didn't cross your mind ever?  My honest answer to you, and this is my honest answer, and maybe it goes through your mind,  I don't think in those terms.  Do you drive to work?  I drive myself every day.  All right, I got to say, because I'm just being honest, that when that happens, I will  pull the worst possible thought will come to my head. 
[03:04:00]  If it's an Asian gentleman, I will use, and I'm not yelling it out the window, unless it's  a cab driver.  If somebody cuts me off, or somebody's being like, you know, obnoxious, you know, I might  think you blankety-blankety, you know, sort of the stuff that you guys say on XM every  day.  Right.  And, you know, I might think that, but I'm not thinking in racial terms.  It doesn't come to racial terms.  That person of that race did that to me, I'm just thinking, you know, somebody's a jerk.  So, what, you just used the word jerk?  Yeah, well, yeah.  Hey, do you shake your fist at him, too, Mr. Wilson? 
[03:04:30]  You kids!  You meddling kids!  Get off my lawn, you!  How about this, how about this?  When something comes up, like a case like the...  I feel like I'm in a confessional, but I've, like, got, you know, bright lights in my eyes.  All right, Mr. Hannity, have you ever...  Have you ever...  Well, we're going to get some stuff out of you eventually, Sean, you know that.  During, like, something like, when you read about a case like the Central Park Jogger case,  or some type of an awful...  Like, you know, the way Fat Nick was crucified in the media, and black-on-white hate crimes 
[03:05:00]  are never reported to be hate crimes, because there's a real, you know, you know how the  thinking in the media is, at least, they don't really report them the same as far as what's  a hate crime and what's not.  Let me answer your question with a question, and I'm not avoiding it.  Do you really think most people are racist?  Because I don't.  Oh, absolutely.  No, not racist.  I don't think most people are racist.  But there's a confusion here in this country where, because you're thinking a racist thought,  that it automatically puts you, wham, you are in the whole category of being a racist. 
[03:05:30]  You can think bad words.  You could think and look at people on the outside and think, oh, god damn, that...  You should hear what I'm thinking about Combs every night when he's on the air.  Well, all right.  Oh, does he stink?  See, now, if there was a racist term for bedwetting liberal...  Hey, you know what?  We never talked about it.  When we did your show last, and you were controlling the interview like you control every night on  that show, and all of a sudden, he started talking, and it was an honest reaction from 
[03:06:00]  me.  I actually looked at him and said, wow, he talks.  Oh, I know.  Did you guys talk about it after we left?  Because it looked like I really hurt his feelings, but it was just an honest reaction from me.  You know, by the way, you guys did have a good appearance on Letterman.  I thought that was a pretty...  Thank you, Sean.  How did you guys get along with him behind the scenes?  He doesn't talk to anybody.  There was pretty much no getting along.  He came over by the wings, shook our hand before he announced us, and then that was  the last we saw of him.  When he left, they called him crackers. 
[03:06:30]  We got a quick handshake 30 seconds before he went on the air.  Yeah.  Like, you come into the dressing room, and you shoot the shit.  No, we were hanging out.  Yeah.  You know, somebody had said that he does that, and that's kind of odd to me.  Well, Jimmy did Letterman, what, two weeks ago now, Jimmy?  Three weeks?  Actually, I saw him.  I thought he did a great job.  Yeah, thanks, man.  November 1st, I did it.  That was a really good job.  Thank you.  I was waiting to see if you'd be able to do it and not curse.  You did a good job.  Oh, yeah.  I've done that one before.  You know you can't curse, so what you can do.  He's done Leno a million times, but I went with Jimmy, and we were in the hallway, and 
[03:07:00]  Jimmy just finished his set, got off, and then Letterman finished the show.  They're shaking hands and hanging on TV like they're best of pals, right?  So Jimmy's like, maybe I can get a picture with Letterman.  They actually shushed us away and wouldn't let us stand in the hallway so he could quickly  go up the stairs and into the catacombs.  He's consistent, though.  Yeah, he likes that with everybody.  I said, Leno comes to your room, and the J-Bar rolls up.  Yeah, they bring in food and stuff.  Jay brings you to his house in a classic car.  I've never been invited to do Letterman. 
[03:07:30]  I have been invited to do Leno, and it just never worked out all the time I was out there,  and he does seem like the nicer guy.  Well, Sean, we'll tell you all about Leno when we do it December 21st.  You're going to be on Leno the 21st?  21st doing Leno.  They certainly are.  Jay's been a big supporter of the show since we came back on.  He's been really, really supportive.  We just created a shitstorm all day.  What day was it, Wednesday?  Yeah.  Wednesday, Letterman and Leno were fighting over us.  Oh, really?  That's right.  How did Leno win out?  Well, what happened was we did Letterman, and we talked to a big-time producer right after 
[03:08:00]  our appearance, and she said, you guys did great.  They were really happy.  And they said, we want to have you back in December.  And we did the show in, like, August.  So they had three months, and we kept calling from time to time, and we're trying to find  out when is this date in December.  And it never really came about, but they said, no, we really want you back.  And then we found out they wanted to put us on the 18th.  Sorry I'm making this long-winded.  But we don't have any room at this moment.  And Leno's people have been bugging us for well over a year, and we didn't even know it  because someone was kind of doing their thing behind the scenes. 
[03:08:30]  So we finally said, well, all right, we'll do Leno on the 21st.  Letterman's people found out about that and said, oh, no, then we'll have him on the 21st.  And then at that point, we're like, you know what?  Screw it.  We're doing Leno.  And I heard the booker was a black guy.  I think you're almost better off being like an actor in that, you know, when your movie  comes out or when they want you on, you do both shows, and whoever books you first,  that's where you go.  And no one had told these guys that Leno's, because I know guys that book Leno because  they've booked me on it, and they called me and they go, how come they won't  call us back?  Why is there no?  We had no idea.  No one told Opie and Anthony that Leno was trying to get the movie. 
[03:09:00]  No problem with my good friends at the David Letterman drill.  Oh, absolutely not.  He was great to you.  I know he was.  No, I thought he was very nice and somewhat deferential.  Was there any Stern throwback from that?  Nah.  Like who at this point, Sean?  Who?  You know what?  I ought to slap myself in the head.  How dare I think that?  Are they really talking about Stern at this point?  Is it anybody?  Well, by the way, you guys, how do you like to walk over it?  Is that working out, or when are you going to negotiate that out of your contract?  ASAP.  When January hits? 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, this first snowflake that hits our heads, the walkover's over.  Wait a minute.  I know what's going on here.  I've got more information out of you.  Sean Haney is spinning this around, and he's now interviewing us.  He's really good.  We're interviewing you.  You're explaining the Letterman mix-up, and I don't know how this turned.  We were going to grill Sean, and now he's got you.  We want to know if you've used the word.  He knew.  And how close you've come to using the word.  He told us we were all interviewing.  I've given you an honest Andrew.  He said he's being absolutely honest.  Do you see how good he is, though?  No.  He's the best.  That's why I said he is Superman. 
[03:10:00]  He's good.  He said, yeah, you were good at Letterman and you, too.  And groveling asses that we were like, oh, God, gee, thanks a lot.  And now we're just answering questions.  And then we forgot about what we were asking him.  Five seconds from getting done, hanging up and going, hey, wait a minute.  He bamboozled us.  You know, you guys are too much.  You crack me up.  We love you, Sean.  Listen, when are you coming back on my show?  I'm just expecting something big to happen any day now.  You guys are overdue.  Oh, please, no.  Don't jinx us.  Don't get pleat.  I'm begging you.  Don't get in trouble.  You should have heard the speech I gave Jimmy. 
[03:10:30]  And I think Opie, I heard it, but about not talking about certain events that happened over the weekend in certain lights that might get us thrown off the air.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What?  Now you see, now you piqued my interest.  Tell me more.  Well, I was saying, like, what happened with the police shooting over the weekend here in New York City.  Undercover cops unloaded on a wedding party coming out of a bridal, a bachelor party coming out of a strip club. 
[03:11:00]  And detail's still sketchy, wondering what's happening there.  But, you know, Reverend Al is fair game.  This guy will latch on to anything.  But, you know, there's no Greaseman humor.  I'm like, could we just get on and not do any Greaseman humor and try to keep our jobs?  You do a pretty good Greaseman imitation.  What a doodle-y.  But I won't be talking about any shootings or slinging lead.  None of that.  I want to keep this job for a second or two.  Well, you see, but you guys are thinking in the right direction. 
[03:11:30]  You know, probably one of the benefits of not being on in the afternoon is probably you don't start drinking until after you get off the air.  Hey, we don't drink.  Yeah.  We're all sober, nice people.  I have Mike.  Listen, I will say this.  I mean, for your audience, and I don't want to shatter any illusions that people may have of you guys.  There it is.  Yes, Mr. Hannity.  I'm hanging out with O&A in the green room at Hannity and Combs.  No one's going to believe you.  You've got two of the nicest girls you'd ever want hanging out with them, their girlfriends.  Sweethearts.  And you just seem like normal guys, but I always have this impression of you, having listened to the show a lot, that you guys are out of your mind crazy. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  No, they're home with the girls listening to Citizen Cope.  Any insight on Anderson Cooper?  I have no, I don't even, I never met him.  No, as a matter of fact, I did.  I met him at Terry Schiavo.  Oh.  When I was covering that.  You did?  Did he find you attractive, Sean?  I don't think so.  Wait, you guys went to see Terry Schiavo?  No, I was covering it down there for Fox, and he was covering it, and we just said a quick hello. 
[03:12:30]  That's all, I've never met him outside of that.  How quick was the hello?  A quick liaison.  It was a 20-second hello.  20 seconds of locked eyes?  Well, they just want to get down in business.  It was no...  Screw the hellos.  Let's get it over.  Yeah.  Oh, sorry, Sean.  Jesus.  Anyway, how's it being back on Terrestrial?  There he goes.  You are the best.  God damn John Hannity, man.  I love it.  We didn't get anything out of him.  No, we got nothing out of him, and now we're spilling our guts like three fairies. 
[03:13:00]  As soon as I saw him on the hotline, I'm thinking, man, he's pretty brave to call our show in the middle of this discussion.  He's pro, man.  I was stupid.  I wasn't thinking...  He laughs at us.  This guy is a professional in every sense of the word.  I called your show, and I defended you much to the grin of others at the time when you were in most than your biggest amount of trouble.  Yes.  We don't need you anymore, Sean.  When we were...  I'm good for nothing now.  When we were troubled and downtrodden and sitting out two years getting paid, you defended us.  You certainly did.  Hey, Sean, what are you working on for tonight's show? 
[03:13:30]  Are you doing the cop thing?  Yeah, I'm not sure if we're doing it.  I'll do it on radio this afternoon.  We're working on that.  We're hammering away.  I don't know if you know this impeached judge, Alcee Hastings.  We've been covering that story pretty badly.  Wait, is that the woman that...  No, Alcee Hastings.  Oh, okay.  You're going back.  Let me tell you a story from a political point.  Here he was.  He was impeached and convicted on eight counts for accepting a bribe.  Now, he ultimately wasn't convicted in a court, but he was convicted in the Senate.  And now they're considering this guy to be the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, which would make him one of the most powerful guys in terms of national security in the country. 
[03:14:00]  And the very people that impeached him going back, you know, 15 years ago are the ones that now want to give him that power.  Let me guess.  The Democrats.  Of course.  By the way, Opie, who did you vote for?  You're part of what happened in this election.  I chose not to vote.  That's what I do.  Sean, it might have been a little rough even if Opie voted.  Yeah.  Even if Opie voted Republican, it might have been a little rough to slip by this time around. 
[03:14:30]  I think Hillary got 70% in New York.  Yeah, New York is just...  People have just...  Look, I'm more conservative.  People have had it.  You know, look, let's be honest.  Bush has not been a good spokesman.  And about the things he's been nitpicking about, like stem cells and gay marriage, it's like, come on, man, stop it.  Listen, a lot of it is we've been on a war footing for over five years.  People are tired of it.  They want to go out and go to baseball and hockey games and football games and drink beer and love their kids and not have to worry about it.  Yeah.  No war is clean. 
[03:15:00]  You always have problems and difficulties.  The economy's thriving.  I don't know why they're not taking credit for it.  And, you know, there are certain things that happened timing-wise that weren't good for the Republicans.  And there's a natural flow to this.  You know, it's almost like radio ratings.  They're up and they're down and they're up and they're down.  And sometimes there's no explanation for it all, but it all seems to work itself out in a while.  I think the fact, though, that a lot of the Republican candidates were really just going, no thanks, Mr. Bush, I'll handle it myself, is kind of telling, you know, that they didn't even want the support of the President of the United States because they knew his approval rating really stinks. 
[03:15:30]  His approval rating's down.  You know, I got to spend a little time with him before the election.  And the thing I like the most about him, more than anything else, is he doesn't care what people think.  He feels he wakes up.  That's obvious.  I don't think you're surprising anybody.  It matters if you want approval ratings.  You know, if you're doing a radio show, you need to be popular.  You need to have people love you in some way. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  He wakes up every day, and he's got to make sure that the country's secure so that we can go on the radio and have fun every day.  Let me tell you something, though.  You know who else did that?  Ronald Reagan was his man's man.  He was his own man.  He didn't care what the polls did.  But the things he was doing were good for the country in the long run.  And he really believed it was good for the country, and I'm just not feeling that with the...  Anthony, if you go back, when Reagan cut taxes, people were screaming he was going to lead us into a depression. 
[03:16:30]  When he modernized weaponry in Europe, standing up to the Soviets, they said he was going to start a nuclear holocaust in World War III.  When he walked away from Reykjavik, people thought the world was about to end.  That was pretty partisan, though, back then.  At this point, we're getting Republicans that are also now saying, like, they're losing confidence in the guy.  Some are in the war in Iraq.  I don't think there's any doubt.  But, you know, this has not been resolved, period.  Look, one or two scenarios are going to unfold. 
[03:17:00]  Either we're going to win this thing in Iraq, they're going to be able to secure it for themselves, and we're going to pull out of there, and it's going to be successful,  and it'll have a positive impact for generations on the region, or it's going to collapse, and it will not have succeeded.  And if that happens, I think we're all worse off because of it, because the world's just going to be that much more volatile and dangerous,  and you have one more area where these extremist nutcases can go out there and prepare for the next attack on us.  Michael Richards?  We're talking about him again? 
[03:17:30]  I have a question for you.  Nancy Pelosi, one word.  Has that ever flashed in your head, Sean?  Absolutely, it just did.  There you go.  There's your honest answer.  You know what I take away from this?  How cool is it that Sean and he hangs with President Bush and O.P. in it?  I know.  It's just one degree of separation.  The only question I didn't ask him was if he listens to O&A.  I should have asked.  Yeah, there you go.  Could you ask him next time?  I love those guys.  Hey, listen, I've already got enough questions answered for you guys. 
[03:18:00]  Be honest.  Yeah, yeah.  You did good, Sean.  Thank you.  I like you, Sean, a lot.  All right, guys, you're terrific.  But listen, I'm boring your show.  Go get it.  Nah.  No, not at all.  So, the big plug, Sean.  Hannity and Combs.  Oh, you don't hang up on Sean.  The guy talks to the president, you dick.  You don't hang up on Sean Hannity.  I think he saw it coming, though.  He was quick.  Hannity and Combs.  When's it on?  I don't know.  Fox News all the time. 
[03:18:30]  I don't know.  And his radio show is on...  All the time.  All the time.  He's on everything.  He's on XM.  He's on regular radio.  He's on TV.  The guy is...  I see...  When I go to the Fox website, you see Sean Hannity will be talking to Vice President Cheney  today.  It's like, fucking guy's talking to Cheney.  We can't get Danny DeVito.  He's standing us up.  Yeah.  What?  He gets stood up by all kinds.  He didn't stand us up, but he's...  He can't.  You see how tall he is?  A little fella.  You know how many shitty guests we took because we were told that the freaking Danny DeVito  was coming out?  I know.  Enough with the favors. 
[03:19:00]  I have been livid all the fucking weekend.  No more favors.  That's how they rope us in.  Stupid Roland.  Look, you know, it's the same people that have Danny DeVito, so if you get blah, blah from  this blah, blah moment, don't give a shit about it, we'll get Danny DeVito on the program.  Hold on, Roland.  I want to know...  No, but for Danny DeVito, we didn't take anybody.  He just called in because we did...  It's part of the FX channel. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, my God.  Part of the FX channel.  Well, he was supposed to do four days of press and then it was cut down to two days.  So he had to go.  Four days of press, cut down to two days.  So that's still two days.  So I haven't seen him on anything.  Yeah.  What's he doing?  What did he do?  What did he do?  Yeah.  He's going to do the Today Show, Regis and Kelly.  Yeah.  Regis and Kelly.  I understand you got to do those shows.  They're massive shows.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  Let's be honest.  You're pushing a film.  I'm sure it's funny. 
[03:20:00]  What's it called?  I don't know.  Deck the Halls.  Oh, it's kind of a Christmas theme.  It's one of those neighbors kind of feuding over other Christmas decorations.  Yeah.  Pretty much, yeah.  It's cute.  What?  It's one for the kids.  What?  You can take the kids.  All right, listen.  Prison place.  You see any movies this weekend?  No.  I did.  Which one?  What did you see?  I saw...  Oh, Jesus.  I forgot. 
[03:20:30]  I forgot what movie you saw this weekend.  That's...  This week?  I saw Fast Food Nation.  And?  How was it?  It was pretty good.  It was good.  Every movie he sees is pretty good.  Why was it pretty good?  Exploits the fast food places.  Did you go to a late show?  Have sex while a fat girl looked out?  By the way, Adam, to fully enjoy Roland, just let him die.  Yeah.  Let him wither on the vine.  This is the beauty of Roland.  So tempting.  It gets so uncomfortable. 
[03:21:00]  Everybody wants to help him out because that's your natural instinct, especially when you do a radio show.  But what we try to do, and it's really tough, we bite our tongue sometimes, just let him...  It got so uncomfortable.  That's what I'm saying.  I want to yell out racial slurs.  That's what I want.  That's why I...  I was pushed to that level.  That's why I want to acknowledge it today because I know you did exactly what we all do.  It's like, oh my God, he's dying.  I got to save him.  You want to help him.  You want to help him because he looks like Liza Minnelli's father in Arthur.  Hey, that's pretty good.  Oh, so it's about the food what? 
[03:21:30]  It's about them hiring Mexicans to go work for a meat company, and then they didn't cut the meat right, so poop is in the burger.  Hiring who?  Mexicans.  Mexicans?  Mexicans?  You want to go first?  I don't know.  Wait, what?  Mexicans?  The character's name is Mexican?  No, the people who work in the plant.  Are what?  Mexicans?  This cannot be real.  They flee south of the border and run to Shea Stadium. 
[03:22:00]  This can't be real.  They're what?  Mexicans.  What?  Mexicans?  This cannot be real.  But here's the most important thing.  What nationality are you?  Mexican?  Mexicans?  Espanol.  All right, so the Mexicans, well, basically, they come across a border, and they work for  this meat packing company that sells to this, like, McDonald's-type fast food place.  That's meat packing. 
[03:22:30]  Ah, still quite.  I agree a little bit.  Yep.  So, and then Greg Kinnear comes in and investigates the meat.  Because the-  It has high feces matter.  Greg Kinnear investigates the Mexicans?  Wait, it has a high feces matter in the meat.  So, the Mexicans, um, they print.  I've been listening for a half hour.  Is this a documentary?  It's sort of. 
[03:23:00]  It's like, just say it.  It has actors.  It has actors in it, but it's-  It's untrue.  It's based on a true story?  It's based on that book, yeah.  Where did the Mexicans come from?  Mexico.  Mexico?  What?  Tijuana, Mexico?  Mexico.  Mexico.  Mexico.  Mexico.  Go, Mexico, go.  Let's go, Mexico.  How do you live and pay rent?  Are you kidding me?  No.  Wow.  Wow.  It's okay.  And you-  And he is one.  They're playing in the World Series of Meat, and- 
[03:23:30]  And they traded Glavin.  Yeah.  Yeah, what?  What the-  All right, so you like this movie about the Mexicans?  It was okay.  I mean, nothing great.  Yeah.  And then I saw Bond again.  That was-  Why would you see it again?  It's really good.  It's really good, so I saw it again.  Action.  He'll do that.  Mm.  Stuff.  Stuff.  Good James Bond?  It was good, yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of action?  Some action.  It goes back to, like, the beginning of Bond, gets his car.  Now, I don't understand something about this. 
[03:24:00]  Don't spoil anything.  I hate the spoilers.  Right.  I want to see it.  But how do they do this thing?  Because I know this is kind of like almost a prequel to how Bond gets kind of started, but  it's in modern day?  Yeah.  How is that possible?  Well, it takes place now.  It's like, now.  Like, oh, there it is.  On screen.  Wow.  See, that's a little idiot.  If he was on TV doing freaking movie reviews, I don't know. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, my God.  That's all I would do is watch your movie reviews.  I'm trying to figure out.  Like, you go, it's now.  I know it's now.  How do they explain, like, the fact that James Bond was around, like, during the Cold War?  There's no Cold War now.  James Bond was known for, like, fighting the Russians in the Cold War.  And if this is a prequel, how could it happen?  And he'd become a secret agent in 007 now, in today's time.  They really never went back and they never told you. 
[03:25:00]  They just, like, started the film.  And you see him get his 00 license.  They started the film.  Is that how it happened?  I hope so.  On schedule.  What, do you expect him to come out and fucking do, like, a four-act play and then the movie  starts?  They just, uh.  They started the film.  So there was no explanation of earlier Bonds?  No.  It just came out like he started, uh, chased a guy, captured him, and they go, you get  the 00 status, and then shoots a gun, and then you hear, dum, dum, that song. 
[03:25:30]  What song?  The Bond song.  Yeah, how's it go again?  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  Yes, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do 
[03:26:00]  Doo-loo.  Doo-loo, yeah.  Doo-loo.  I forgot the doo-loo part.  Who did the, is there a, now I know in previous Bond movies, very special, very, something  a lot of artists wanted, musicians wanted, the song.  Chris Cornell.  The opening song. 
[03:26:30]  Chris Cornell?  Mm-hmm.  And that's the new Bond song?  Yeah.  Does it have a Bond sound to it?  Can we hear a little of it?  Do we have it?  Different.  It's different.  It's like the older style, like the sound.  You know which one I liked, and call me a flaming faggot.  Faggot.  Either way.  God damn Duran Duran's 007 song.  Oh, yeah, that was fine.  Viewed to a kill.  That's okay.  For the time.  No one's going to call you a faggot for that.  All right.  How about the cock in my mouth?  Well, that could be a cock.  That just makes you a good egg. 
[03:27:00]  Makes you a good pal.  That might be a problem, yeah.  Doo-doo-doo-doo.  Doo-doo-doo.  Wait, a doo-loo-doo.  Doo-doo-doo.  Doo-doo-doo-doo.  So there's no previous James Bond.  It's just now.  It's almost like Batman Begins.  So instead of all that bullshit at the beginning, it's like, we're starting right now.  Here it is.  Modern day.  Fuck you.  Whatever happened beforehand.  You find out why he became 007. 
[03:27:30]  But now.  But now.  Not like find out way back when.  Because it was now.  Because it's now.  And he was...  Movie started.  Let me get this right.  Movie started.  He chased the guy.  Shoot.  Doo-doo-doo-doo.  Double O7.  Lou.  Don't forget the doo-loo.  Doo-loo.  Doo-doo-loo.  Doo-doo-doo.  And he's 007.  The end.  Now.  Now.  Now.  Now.  Now he just says now.  And when you saw it the second time, did it start in the same place?  Yeah.  Okay.  And the last King of Scotland I saw.  Oh. 
[03:28:00]  Idi Amin.  Yeah.  There's going to be some Oscars.  It's really good.  As far as that movie goes.  I heard not quite enough Idi Amin, though.  It's more about the guy and his relationship.  That's what's.  Yeah.  And then.  Because I kind of would have liked a little more Idi Amin.  Who's Forrest Whitaker play?  Idi Amin.  Oh.  Idiot Amin.  Idiot Amin.  Idiot Amin.  What's his name?  Idi Amin.  Idi.  Idi Amin.  He's keeping those teeth down so nothing escapes.  Idi Amin.  Idi Amin. 
[03:28:30]  Idi Amin.  Do they go through the Entebbe Airport thing in that movie?  They had one scene there.  One scene there?  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do.  That's kind of fake.  Do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do.  And then he chases someone and he's double-O what?  Amin.  Double-O Amin.  Double-O Amin.  Can I have the do-do again?  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do-do.  You don't really like.  Do-do-do-do.  No.  Put a little more music in it.  All right.  Close your eyes.  Make sure we read it out here.  That'll help.  All right.  James Bond. 
[03:29:00]  Theme.  Go.  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do.  Do-do-do.  Of course it is.  Even when his eyes are closed, they raise up.  Yeah, yeah.  They're completely closed.  Then the mouth goes to hands.  His hands go out.  I just...  Is that as excited as you get?  No.  All right.  Sing it.  No.  All right.  Let's go.  Let's go.  I don't.  Look.  Some passion.  Everyone close their eyes.  All right.  Let's go.  Let's go.  All right.  Close your eyes at home.  All right.  Come on.  Excitement.  While you're driving. 
[03:29:30]  Let's go.  Come on, Roland.  All right.  Go.  Do-do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Wow.  I felt like I was there.  Yeah.  The car chases.  The action.  What pizzazz you have.  Because you hear that music, you think Bond.  Here's a great observation from Dave.  Dave in Jersey.  Go ahead.  Hey, I had no intention of seeing this movie until I heard this review.  Because most movie reviews give away too much in a movie.  Yeah.  Because this give away nothing.  I want to see it after that.  He didn't even get the title out of it. 
[03:30:00]  He didn't even say.  What was the title?  Cassino Royale.  He didn't even say that.  Right.  No.  Not even the title.  All right.  You want to hear Chris Cornell doing the theme?  Yeah.  Let me hear it.  Let's see if it's a Bond.  Let's see if it's a Bond.  Let's see if it's a Bond.  Ah, doo-doo-doo-doo.  Yeah.  Da-doo-doo-la-dee-doo.  Da-da-dee-doo.  If you take a life, do you know what you'll give? 
[03:30:30]  I'll tell you all night.  He's got a sick voice.  When the storm arrives, would you be seen with me?  Roland, do they do a little thing where they show him turn and shoot,  and the red blood comes down over the...  Yes, it's black and white.  So they still do that?  Okay.  Just wondering.  I've seen angels fall from blind.  It's good.  The Bond songs are all about the chorus,  so we've got to see.  We've got to see. 
[03:31:00]  For yourself,  I'm nothing so divine.  Just next in line.  There we go.  On yourself,  because no one else here will stay.  The odds will betray.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  I want to hear Roland's calliope.  La, da, da, da, da, da.  Do-do.  La, da, do-do.  Do-do.  Let's say hi to Bruce in Louisiana. 
[03:31:30]  Bruce?  Yeah, I think the reason you guys aren't quite picking it up  is because he's doing Mission Impossible,  not James Bond.  Are you?  Do-do, do-do.  No, I think he's doing do-do-do-do.  He's doing Bond.  Can you say that word again?  For the people that live, like, south of America.  Mexico?  Well, that's where they're from,  but what are they?  No, Mexicans.  Mexicans.  Mexicans.  Mexicans.  Wow.  I just like that.  Roland, you are golden. 
[03:32:00]  That's just beautiful.  You are golden.  I want to see you dance around a hat.  All right.  I'm going to take a break.  I got to piss badly.  Yeah, me too.  I want Roland to join me.  The cocks are flowing.  Come on, all of us.  I say all in one urinal.  Do a little man-to-man comparing.  Here we go.  Let's go.  Adam, you in?  Everyone.  Let's go.  Adam, you in?  Everyone, dicks out.  Come on now.  All right.  Well, I'll do-do.  Do-do-la-la-do-do.  La-la-la-la-do-do.  La-la-la-do-do.  I had a lovely time tonight. 
[03:32:30]  Thank you so much, Dennis.  Maybe we could do this again sometime?  Dennis, stop.  No, Dennis.  No, Dennis.  Rape Kid and Crawl Space.  Mornings.  I don't care. 
[03:33:00]  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Hey, we're looking for original videos or animations no more than three minutes long.  Based around the cast and crew of The Opian Anthony Show.  The best video wins $1,000 from hotmovies.com.  Details and examples are posted on opiananthony.com. 
[03:33:30]  Do we have any of these coming in?  I saw one on YouTube of Jimmy as a baby, which was kind of funny.  Kind of adorable.  Did it make fun of me?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I don't like that.  That's up on YouTube.  I like how Danny's going for that Russian spy that just ate radioactive sushi look.  He looks like that Russian in the black and white video that's decapitated.  You ever see that one with the foot on the face?  Steve, any videos coming in for the $1,000?  A handful.  A handful of them.  Bad?  Yeah, no, we're kind of waiting for someone to really, really hit a home run. 
[03:34:00]  Because there was one of, I think, no filter, not no filter Paul, Buffalo Paul did one that  was like a combination of just old footage.  Of what?  Just a combination of old footage that he edited together, which was, eh.  That's funny.  There's Jimmy.  That's good.  Oh, I haven't seen this video contest.  It's called Little Baby Jimmy.  It's on YouTube.  It's pretty good.  Little Baby Jimmy.  The concept's good.  It's the dancing baby with Norton's head on it. 
[03:34:30]  Well, Ant, did Steve have any comment when he saw the video?  Yes.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  A lot of those coming in, right?  Hey, the Prius guy died.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yes, he did.  I'm sorry, Steve.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, he did, Steve.  I'm saddened.  Yeah.  How'd your parents die?  I was just the one guy.  It's okay.  Someone wants to make a funeral arrangement, Steve.  No, nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  Oh, you'll handle the funeral arrangements for the guy? 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  I hear he crashed very close, though.  What are you doing in my house?  Horrible thing.  And he lived for a couple of seconds to be questioned by Steve.  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And this was bad.  This might have been the thing that actually killed him.  Get the fuck out.  Now.  Made him leave.  He shouldn't have moved him.  He should have laid there until the EMTs got there, but.  Well, the guy said that my flight didn't make it to his destination.  Why not? 
[03:35:30]  Well.  And then he died and couldn't answer the question.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  Don't get angry.  I know.  Grr.  Grr.  Very.  You're in the anger phase.  Grr.  Not in the sorrow phase.  Round and round.  Grr.  Oh, this could go on forever, Adam.  Just sit back.  Take a breather.  Smoke a cigarette.  Do whatever you have to.  It's funny.  When they're done, they're done.  That's pretty much it. 
[03:36:00]  I like that.  I said, it's funny.  Steve goes, is it?  Hey, when does this contest end?  The 15th?  15th, I believe, yes.  All right.  Best video.  We'll win $1,000 from hotmovies.com.  It's wide open.  We're not getting a lot of really good ones yet.  Here's what you do.  Maybe get still pictures of somebody on the show.  Steal a clip from a movie using some kind of grab it program.  And you put a head on a body in the movie.  And it's just automatically hysterical. 
[03:36:30]  Doesn't matter what the fuck the scene is.  If it's put together well.  Our heads on movie bodies scream.  Always funny.  Always in panic.  A rip.  What am I doing in that baby video?  Pissing yourself.  You're like bitching and complaining.  And then they play your music.  You get happy.  And then you get peed on by another baby.  All right.  See?  It's up on YouTube.  Check it out.  It's called Lil Baby Jimmy.  Yeah.  Original videos or animations.  No more than three minutes long.  All right.  And no less than four seconds. 
[03:37:00]  There you go.  Best video wins $1,000 from hotmovies.com.  Details and examples posted on opianancy.com.  You got like a little over two weeks to get your videos in.  All right.  This is a plane flying around.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Aw.  Yeah.  I'm hosting the AVN Awards January 13th in Vegas.  And Steve is coming out to help grab some audio and stuff.  Oh.  Oh.  When you put it that way, it wasn't even a surprise. 
[03:37:30]  No, not Steve is coming out.  Couldn't you wait for Sweep Week?  I know.  Well, why not make another poignant announcement?  Like, you know, the sun does rise.  He sits in the web.  All right, Steve.  You're doing a terrific job.  Exactly.  There he goes.  Steve, power bottom Carly.  See?  He likes the top from the bottom.  Tie my hands up.  That's not being a submissive. 
[03:38:00]  Make me suck it.  Steve, what are you in GTA Vice City Stories?  I haven't seen you yet.  You're on a golf course, I guess?  I haven't seen myself either.  The only, uh, I guess I'm a golfer.  Yeah, you got to hit the golf course.  Oh, you got to find the golf course.  You've gotten that far in?  No, I haven't.  I haven't.  I haven't seen it yet, but I'm a golfer, and I think I did like two or three commercials  for them.  They're on the radio station.  Oh, I have heard you do one of the commercials.  Very good.  Oh, thank you.  Yes.  Okay.  Nice. 
[03:38:30]  Hey, uh, a story we meant to get to last week.  We can do this before the line of the day.  The man with half his face paralyzed.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Poor fella.  We forgot all about this guy.  We got the news story.  Uh, yeah.  Jeffrey Woodcock.  No.  Uh-oh.  No.  How is it paralyzed?  Somebody was laughing, and he got mad, and they punched him?  I know, the school beatings that he got with the name Woodcock.  Woodcock and half a face that works. 
[03:39:00]  Woodcock fit in that other half of your mouth?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Hey, we haven't heard from Pat.  I know.  Bugs me.  Eggnog drinking contest?  Is he in or not?  Probably in training.  You would think he would have called by now.  Yeah.  Where's Pat?  Well, you know.  I was trying to explain him to my girlfriend, like, what a Pat from Monaki is.  Like, you can't describe it.  Inexplicable.  You must see him.  What a Pat from Monaki joke is.  Like, what would you describe?  Like, is it a pun? 
[03:39:30]  Is it a lot of puns that aren't funny, and he loses confidence anyway.  There's no way to describe it.  No way to describe it.  Now we're all trying to do a Pat from Monaki joke.  We can all do the uncomfortable mood.  Yeah, there he is.  There he is.  He'll give us one.  Wow.  Hey, Pat.  Pat.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, Pat?  Hey, what's up?  Always Bob.  Yeah.  Always trying to be chipper and keep the best foot forward. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah.  Forget that childhood.  Best foot forward.  What is that?  The one with five toes?  What?  What, Pat?  Hiding my inner torment.  Inner torment.  Oh, he says it.  And you live there by Teterboro, I guess, right?  That is correct, sir.  Right at the end of the runway.  Runway model.  A runway model.  See?  That's one.  There you go.  Model T for Teterboro. 
[03:40:30]  That's horrible.  Pat, Friday's the big day.  Yep.  We should just rename it Pat from Monaki Day.  Yeah, as long as Eric Badlands Booker stays in retirement, I'm okay.  Are you happy he's not going to show up this year?  Uh, well, uh, yes.  Meh.  Eh.  You're the, uh, you're the favorite again.  Quacks.  I know.  Yeah.  Hopefully.  Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.  He's the fraud from Courageous Cat.  Yeah, Courageous Cat. 
[03:41:00]  I'm eating a duck.  How are you ever going to...  I'll hit him with my eggnog gun.  No, never mind.  Courageous Cat.  Courageous Cat.  Oh, familiar sounds.  So are you training for the eggnog drinking contest?  As a matter of fact, I am.  You are.  I also have a meatball eating contest the next day in Atlantic City.  He's a professional eating competition.  Yeah, he's, um...  How much molestation are you covering?  Was there like a group of 30 neighbors that jerked off on you at the same time? 
[03:41:30]  How much pain is in there, Pat?  Eggnog and meatballs back to back.  I can't put enough food in eggnog.  I can't put an eggnog on top of me.  My back.  Hey, what's the record, Pat?  I keep forgetting.  I know you know.  It was, I believe, 71.  71 double shots of eggnog before you puked.  In my losing effort, yes.  Yes.  That was an amazing competition last year.  The first time Pat was on the show, I think it was the eggnog contest or whatever it was. 
[03:42:00]  Actually, cherry darts.  Oh, is it cherry darts?  Yeah.  When did, Anthony, when did, you got a car crashed, you didn't have headphones on, and  you didn't realize that your jokes were awful?  It wasn't done to be ironic.  He must have got a car crash 60 times.  Yeah.  Wouldn't stop.  Everything he said.  But he didn't have headphones on, so he had no idea.  Jimmy said he liked me because I take a lot of swings.  Did I?  A lot of swings.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We just car crash everything that comes out of his mouth except the eggnog.  That's the funniest shit.  All right, Pat.  We'll see you Friday. 
[03:42:30]  Yes, sir.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  And I have a big announcement before I take my first drink of eggnog.  Losing another toe?  No.  You're gay?  No, but close.  No, no.  Just kidding.  Wow.  You're petrifying us.  You're getting a stomach stapling?  No.  You're moving.  No.  You reconnected with your dad? 
[03:43:00]  Ew.  No.  Ew, boy.  You're buying a cat?  I'm...  No.  I don't buy cats.  You're finally going to pull down your pants when you're shit.  Yeah.  No.  Wait, a big announcement?  I'm saving...  Well, big for me.  Big for you.  New van.  I'm saving it for Friday.  All right.  Hey, that's a great tease for the show.  I think I know what it is.  Wow.  You're going to bring...  You're going to start wearing makeup so no one sees that you have rosacea. 
[03:43:30]  Aw.  Damn, I wanted to hold it.  No.  You got a girlfriend.  I'm not saying anything.  Ew.  Oh.  Ew.  Damn.  I ruined it.  I ruined it.  Wait a minute.  Is there a Ms. Munaki?  Love is in the air.  I don't know.  Oh.  Let me think.  Do we know her?  Friday.  Friday.  Please tell me it's a Vietnamese chick that's 16 and a half. 
[03:44:00]  Oh.  She sounds lovely, Pat.  I'd like to meet her.  Why don't you bring her by the house this weekend?  We could do a little work.  Yeah.  Double date.  Wow.  All right.  We'll get more info on Friday.  Ooh.  We love radio teases.  Are you bringing her Friday?  Against her will?  Maybe.  We would be very nice to her.  You know that.  If the duct tape holds.  Yeah.  I got to find a duct tape.  It's all my job. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  Oh, please talk just like Pat.  How funny would that be?  Did...  Wait.  You got to let us know.  Is it somebody that we know?  I don't know.  Does her name...  I don't think so.  Does her name rhyme with Walker Fatty?  Hey.  No.  Ew.  So you don't know.  Is this person a regular on the message boards? 
[03:45:00]  No.  No.  Okay.  Pal Talk?  Uh, no.  Not really.  In the country.  Not really.  I know who it is.  Have you been giving Happy Typing Girl a Roman war helmet?  Ooh.  All right.  Let me just think.  Can you tell us where you met her?  Uh...  Online.  Online.  But with...  Did this online experience have anything to do with this program? 
[03:45:30]  Uh...  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Match.com?  About the Star Trek message boards.  That's going to be cool.  We'll meet her Friday.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll leave it at that.  All right.  I'm excited for you.  Ooh.  Thank you.  I'm excited for me.  It'll end in misery.  Tell Lady Di we said hi.  Ah!  Is that a train I had? 
[03:46:00]  All right, Pat.  A train.  A train.  Pat, we'll see you Friday.  All right.  Great.  Bye, sweetie.  He piqued our interest.  There goes Pat with a check.  A lady.  Good for Pat.  Good for Pat.  Good for Pat.  Bad for her.  Man with half his face paralyzed.  Good old Jeffrey Woodcock.  Imagine growing up with half your face totally paralyzed.  That nightmare was one of New York's realities for one person.  Now, he had modern medicine on his side, and it performed a minor miracle. 
[03:46:30]  For 30 years, this is what Jeffrey Woodcock saw when he looked in the mirror.  I'm ugly, and people think that I'm ugly.  He was born with half of his face completely paralyzed.  Doctors aren't sure what caused it, but Jeffrey's left facial nerve just didn't work.  He couldn't smile, frown, blink, or make any other facial expression that most of us  take for granted.  He says it was a tough way to grow up. 
[03:47:00]  Oh, I got teeth.  Oh, yeah, the kids were ruthless.  I was just, you know, never had a date in high school and that whole thing, because,  you know, everyone always, you know, would make fun of me.  Oh, just stand sideways.  An old paralyzed face, yeah.  That's when I started drinking eggnog.  Hey, uh, Ralph, which side's my best pro field?  The one that moves.  I wanted to laugh.  Aw.  Frank.  He's frowning. 
[03:47:30]  What's wrong, Frank?  You don't understand what it's like to want to smile and not be able to.  My mother was injured in a horse accident.  His hoof went into her belly when she was pregnant.  Paralyzed my face muscles.  Into a perpetual frown.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tragic.  I remember on my birthday, all the kids came over, and my neighbor said,  Smiley, you ungrateful little cunt. 
[03:48:00]  All right, well, this is what they're going to do for the guy.  But Dr. Roger Simpson told Jeffrey there was something he could do,  a specialized surgical procedure called facial reanimation.  Dr. Simpson is one of a handful of surgeons in the country  with years of experience doing this operation.  Little surgeons.  And he offered to help Jeffrey.  I'm astounded to see what can be done.  God is like, smile upon me, finally.  He hopes to return that smile with both sides of his face for the first time.  You know, when I was a kid, I was looking in the mirror like, you know, 
[03:48:30]  what would it be like if I always wanted to see what I would look like?  By Photoshop.  And tomorrow I'll show you this unusual surgery  and the difference it's made in Jeffrey's appearance and his life.  Oh, a tease.  So we don't know yet?  Don't know.  Do we have the second part of that?  Do we care?  Imagine he could finally smile and then another 9-11 happens.  Yeah, but he can't do anything but smile.  No matter what kind of news he hears, he has to smile.  He smiles.  That's horrible.  That's terrible. 
[03:49:00]  I'm sorry.  Your grandmother died.  Big dopey smile.  I can't.  I'm sorry.  You're at the funeral.  Yeah, smiling like the Joker.  Line of the Day, sponsored by Bodogfight.com.  Here's today's runner-up line of the day.  She's a nun.  Well into her 90s.  It happens when you've had a lifetime of sex in a few short years.  You just figure it's over, Johnny.  One gentleman in the car and your head hanging out the window like a Labrador  while a passerby takes aim at your tonsils. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah, that's a good one.  That's my great aunt you're talking about.  That's a doozy.  All the way, Meg.  All the way, Meg.  All right.  Yeah, Bodogfight.com.  Log on and watch American fighters battle for the right to represent the U.S.  It's in a bout against the Russians.  It's all on Bodogfight.com.  Do you realize it's all the way, Meg?  It's not even like she'll suck your cock while some other guy fucks her in the ass, Meg. 
[03:50:00]  That isn't enough.  Enough.  It's all the way.  All the way, Meg.  You can't just fuck her in the ass.  You have to put it in a box when you're done.  Right.  That's all she'll accept.  Ass to pussy to mouth.  Yep.  All the way.  Don't you dare take me halfway there.  No.  It wasn't halfway, May.  That's right.  One in each hand.  An unclipped one on her face.  You're not done yet, sonny.  Some of the guys from the Negro League.  All right.  All right. 
[03:50:30]  She wasn't a size queen.  Satchel Paige says she'll be here soon.  Your aunt, the nun, couldn't get enough deep dicking from those fucking ballplayers.  All the white boys were off fighting, and those Negro League players were giving her  the deep dicking of her sinful life.  She was getting her own Tuskegee experiments.  They wouldn't even take her pantyhose off.  They would just deep dick her with her pantyhose still on, and her little feet would curl.  Every time that cock got buried in her, her toes and ankles would curl up together like 
[03:51:00]  a fruit roll up, you put it in the back of the bus now.  All the way, May.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That's why it was all the way.  A partial way.  Wouldn't have gotten the name if it was some other way.  She'd go to slide home, and her legs would open, and her vagina would just scoop up dirt  like it was a steam shovel.  You'd have to bury that cock to the hilt.  You'd have to.  She wouldn't feel it.  Because it's not halfway.  No.  She wanted it all the way. 
[03:51:30]  Balls deep.  Yep.  Balls deep.  Her favorite expression was that she wrapped her gloved hand around you with her fucking  baseball glove still on.  She'd say, go ahead, knock my asshole out.  While you were deep dicking all the way, May.  Missionary style.  She'd have her legs wrapped around you with her uniform still on, and she'd be yelling,  knock my asshole out.  I'm taking one for the team.  What was the team?  Anyone remember?  The Peaches.  The Peaches.  There you go.  Coincidence?  I think not. 
[03:52:00]  Peaches.  The Peaches.  That's right.  All the way, May.  People are saying, well, Coke Logic from Whackbag.  You guys aren't going to address how awful the razzle-dazzle hour was?  Some of our new programming?  I didn't hear the razzle-dazzle hour.  I didn't either.  So why don't we talk about that tomorrow?  I have no clue.  Let's get some highlights.  I don't know.  What is the razzle-dazzle hour, by the way?  I know there's new programming on the virus on the weekends.  Yeah.  I have no clue what it is. 
[03:52:30]  I don't even care.  Everyone's talking about it, and we don't even know.  See?  They're all talking about it, so I guess it worked.  Well, the shows are good.  The Saturday Night Virus is good, because we had Patrice, and then next week we're having  Laszlo, and then Brother Weez is in there.  Wow.  Nice.  Bill Burr, I think, is going to do his show.  So those are cool.  But the razzle-dazzle?  How bad is it, then?  Is it bad?  So, I think Steve should field this one.  Oh, wow.  Wait, how bad is it?  Steve should field this one. 
[03:53:00]  Oh, that's not good.  He's directly...  No, no, no, no.  This wasn't even a partial passing of the buck.  No, you tell us why it's bad.  That was a direct passing, blatant passing of the buck.  You now tell us why it's bad.  Not even subtle.  Yeah.  I'm not...  I actually didn't hear the finished product.  I know the concept was to bring highlights of the walkover.  Ooh, what would you fucking do?  Why are you pluralizing this?  Yeah, highlight of the walkover.  And, um... 
[03:53:30]  Here we go.  Oh, good.  Oh, good.  Relieve.  Look at you babbled long enough.  Tapping out.  Humming out, humming out, humming out, humming out.  Wow, that is really smart.  How bad is the razzle-dazzle hour?  It's really heavily produced.  Yeah.  There's a lot of production wrapped around it.  I don't know.  It was...  We took these, you know, segments of audio that we thought were going to be, you know,  great as standalone bits and just wrapped them in heavy production.  You know, we really gift-wrapped turds. 
[03:54:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, because the walkover isn't one of those...  Then we can't do the razzle-dazzle hour.  It's not a big highlight thing.  Occasionally stuff will happen like the, you know, Dr. R, treat yourselves with the cake  and stuff, which is, you know, stellar.  Some of the best radio we've done.  But they are few and far between.  As we were learning.  The walkover is usually just a walk over.  Yeah.  What the name implies.  So now we've got to hear the razzle-dazzle hour.  I've got to hear some highlights for tomorrow. 
[03:54:30]  Some of the razzle-dazzle hour production, the piece.  Look, we're not avoiding it.  If it sucked, we'll throw all of us under the bus and you guys can have at it.  We want to know.  All of us.  We have nothing to do with the razzle-dazzle hour.  Certainly.  It's segments of the show, so you're in it.  But I didn't produce it and put it together.  Well, the production sounds amazing.  We have a show called When the Mics Are Off.  There's a reason why the mics are off.  It should stay off.  There's just nothing going on, right?  Yeah.  I mean, to give you a little bit of perspective, we're going to run out of content for the  razzle-dazzle variety show in about two more weeks. 
[03:55:00]  So Steve's not only saying it sucks, but we're going to run out of shit real soon.  Yeah.  The shit is running out.  The razzle-dazzle hour was a flop.  That sucks.  All right.  Now we have to hear some highlights from the razzle-dazzle hour.  Why don't you do a razzle-dazzle minute?  We can play that once a week.  Yeah.  There you go.  We could.  We'd actually have enough content to do it for a minute.  So I'm going to say it.  Hold on a minute.  G Baby from FBA, I like some of the razzle-dazzle hour.  When the mics were on, off, was hilarious. 
[03:55:30]  Well, thank you.  All right.  Get some of the stuff tomorrow.  Well, we have When the Mics Are Off as fully produced chunks, I think, in the system.  All right.  Tomorrow.  Okay.  Let's do a whole thing with that tomorrow.  Get some of that stuff on desk.  Even some of your fine production, because I know you want to brag.  I do.  All right.  Do we use the N-word?  Sure.  In the behind-the-scenes when the mics are supposed to be off, but they're on in between?  No?  No N-word?  No.  There wasn't.  Would you cut all those out?  Jesus.  They fly out of my mouth the second the mics are off. 
[03:56:00]  Dan was the one that picked out all the segments here when the mics are off.  And you hear the ping-pong ball being hit by the paddle.  Well, it is on your side, sir.  Sir Tham.  What do you have to say?  Tune in tomorrow.  Ah.  All right.  We'll tune in tomorrow.  Here is today's line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day. 
[03:56:30]  What's the name of Neil Patrick Harris' show there, Michael?  Yeah, How I Met Your Mother.  How I Met Your Mother?  It is a huge hit, actually.  All right, Michael.  Thank you.  I guess he's got to act.  I Met Your Mother.  I was f***ing your father.  Anthony, line of the day.  That certainly was a humdinger.  Sponsored by BodogFight.com.  Listening back without actually hitting the beep button, it does sound like it's beeped somewhere else. 
[03:57:00]  You do it perfectly.  I do a great job.  You're a good beeper.  Thank you.  Adam, you're f***ing f***ed.  You, man.  Adam, you're going to be down where we're going to be down?  Fort Lauderdale.  The improv in Fort Lauderdale.  We're going to be at West Palm Beach.  Are we going to hook up somewhere?  I'm coming to see you Saturday.  Oh.  Yeah.  Nice.  All right.  Well, we're going to be doing our show Monday and Tuesday from the West Palm Beach affiliate.  By the way, support the radio stations.  Right.  Support the radio stations.

And thanks to Citizen Cope for coming in tomorrow and Wednesday at the Nokia Theater.  You can see him or them.  I don't know if there's more people.  And I'll be New Year's Eve at the Borgata in Atlantic City.  I'll be there, too.  Yeah. 
[03:58:00]  Anthony will be there.  I'll be coming.  They get your room?  Oh, boy.  But I wanted to bring in the New Year with my friends.  I'm so glad.  Is the Black Horse Killer going to be there?  Hmm?  He's killing prostitutes.  Oh, in Atlantic City.  Oh, it's Black Horse Killer.  What?  Black Horse.  I thought you meant Black Horse.  I heard Black Horse Killer.  He killed a couple of prostitutes.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I'm out of here.  No. 
[03:58:30]  I did it to myself this time.  Wow.  Did you walk right into that?  Oh, God.  I thought I was going to get out of here alive.  And they're not exactly sure what happened.  They've been looking for him, and the police think they have a lead, but we're not too sure  what's going on.  I'll be there New Year's Eve.  And so will Anthony, and hopefully I'll be there as well. 
[03:59:00]  All right.  I'll be there.  I'll be there.  The art of the homo.  Steve from Foundry.  Also goes by the name Chess Rockwell.  Smooth Lebanese arms.  He's tantalizingly tattooed.  A big books of bear.  Scaring at every turn.  That's terrible.  He's sorry.  He may say, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  But you'll be saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:59:30]  Chess shaved as smooth as a baby's bottom.  Tantalizing turquoise rings.  Martini Steve.  It's a great ending.  Line of the Day is brought to you by Bodog.
