<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Anthony recounting a chaotic Atlantic City weekend.  His tales included being kicked out of a poker room for swearing and suspected collusion, an altercation in a bar resulting in his ejection (involving a female companion using the “c-word”), falling asleep while winning at craps, and waking up covered in crushed fruit after falling asleep during breakfast.  The hosts reacted with exaggerated humor. This was followed by a discussion of a contentious interview with Chris Jericho, escalating due to a joke about Christopher Reeve that deeply offended Jericho because of his mother's condition.  Audio clips of the argument were played, highlighting the intervention of Opie to prevent a physical altercation and Patrice O’Neal’s role in both escalating and de-escalating the situation. The hosts debated the extent of Jericho’s genuine upset.  The segment included a $1000 sound contest won by a caller named Anthony from Boston, which sparked a discussion about sports team loyalty and the concept of “free agent fans.”  Tom Chiusano, a producer, briefly appeared in the studio.

The show continued with a scathing critique of Jerry Seinfeld’s appearance on Larry King Live, featuring played clips highlighting King’s perceived lack of knowledge and poor interviewing skills contrasted with Seinfeld’s apparent annoyance. This was interspersed with tangents, including discussions of Katie Holmes running the New York City Marathon, Anthony’s speeding habits, and various other anecdotes.

A significant portion featured in-studio guest Jim Norton and a showcase of internet videos, ranging from humorous cat videos and clips showing Larry King’s confusion to explicit content like "Two Girls One Cup" and "Lemon Party," eliciting reactions from the hosts and Larry King.

Subsequently, the show shifted to Master Poe and his "body rock" fitness program. Poe joined the show, demonstrating exercises like planks and the "dead bug," while jokes were made about his program, his personality, and the typo on his flyer that made it seem like he was offering "aids."  The vulgarity and sexually explicit references continued throughout this segment.

A later segment focused on Poe's website, masterpieceofshit.com (M.P.O.S.), and his student Mars.  They discussed Poe's body rock class, with Mars characterizing it as primarily for overweight women and gay men.  Their conversation explored their past conflict stemming from an incident involving a woman Poe dated and a Halloween party. Details of the event remained partially undisclosed.  The discussion shifted to Poe’s upcoming radio show, "The Arena," and the extensive clip-gathering involved, including requests for sounds from films like *300*, *Braveheart*, *Gladiator*, and *The Alamo*.  The segment included discussion about their training styles, hugging styles and appropriate male behavior, with several staff members, including an intern responsible for finding audio clips, participating.

The final segment involved Poe’s preparations for his show.  The hosts discussed needed sound effects, including sword clashes, wind sounds, and a "kiai." Poe recounted pre-interviewing ex-cons in a makeshift studio, including a guest who discussed prison fighting techniques like "52 blocks."  Poe attempted to demonstrate a "kiai" with staff member Sam, followed by a discussion on war cries and Poe's use of a stick and a banana to mimic sword fighting sounds. They planned a "Star Wars Poe" skit. The conversation also touched upon the difficulty of defending against a gun and a story about a person who supposedly could catch bullets with their teeth (scheduled to be a guest on Poe's show). The segment concluded with mentions of "line of the day" winners and a sexually suggestive phone call from a woman named Raquel centered around the theme of "donkey sausage."

[00:01:30]  neck this is the worst the worst show i've this is the worst show i've ever been on but enough of this  palaver let's get the show on the road  there it is that wasn't that bad why fix that hey good morning welcome to the opie and anthony show  wow what was that hi hello isn't the sun supposed to be out don't we do this daylight savings thing so 
[00:02:00]  we can maybe get a little sunshine in the morning i assumed that i thought like we would come in here  and it would be light out because it's supposed to be like if it's 6 a.m it's supposed to be 7 a.m  really like that's what it's supposed to look like but well something's going on there's two things i'm  thinking either today the sun decided not to come out that's a distinct possibility meaning we're all  gonna be dead in a few minutes right or it's a cloudy day i don't know one of the two i would i would 
[00:02:30]  think it would be a cloudy day because if the sun didn't come out that would just be  weird i think we'd see a lot more panic out on the streets a little panic well we gained an hour  and there's no hint that uh i see a little blue in the sky yeah a little blue but an hour in usually  is it light out yet i submit to you yes i submit yes it is but not right now all right well here we

[00:08:30]  messed up the story because you you started the story by saying the beers were flowing the shots were  flowing and then the new dealer comes in and she has the attitude everyone is fun though it's not  like like you ever see me drink and get obnoxious doesn't happen it's fun i'm a fun drunk danny had a  few you just messed up telling the story that's all no i didn't as a guy that wasn't there dude when  you set it up with we've been drinking for 12 straight hours the shots are flowing we're having a fun 
[00:09:00]  we have a fun table yeah it was everyone there was really cool a lot of fun there was no problems  that's why i'm saying it wasn't us all right it was the dealer i wasn't there so i don't know for  sure i'm just saying it sounds like nope you guys might have had i'm not even going to cop to that  because it was the dealer because every other dealer was fine the table was fine we're not having  not a problem all right so uh we're like talking a little bit talking amongst ourselves a little bit 
[00:09:30]  but not holding the game up at all you know make make sure the game isn't uh getting uh slowed down  or anything and this dealer just starts getting snippy like doesn't like the conversation doesn't  like um like when we're talking amongst ourselves if the f word comes out like she'll yell that you  know hey hey none of that language here at this table meanwhile like i said every other dealer  was fine and why can't you curse at a freaking poker table exactly there are people that are losing  their livelihood and uh there's no minors don't tell me a kid's gonna be next to a nine-year-old 
[00:10:00]  playing cards thing mister could you just shut up and let me play cards i don't hear that language  don't tell me that pc crap has hit the poker tables now too it's always kind of been a they think it's  classy it's classy when the people don't curse yeah now go bust his head open for cheating it's classy  as people are handing in their deeds so they gamble a little more but yeah but they don't want the f  word okay yeah so so we're sitting there and just getting like really uh p.o'd at this uh this 
[00:10:30]  dealer and uh then she says something and uh at that point all right what'd she say well i think  it was danny do you remember what was actually said by the dealer that actually initiated what  came next yeah no no you were asleep in the chair danny danny was just asleep  laying back in the chair with his eyes closed i wasn't playing because uh just the whole poker the 
[00:11:00]  whole setup with you know the very fast felt pressure so i didn't really want to play so i was  just kind of hanging out at the poker table but uh i was pulling the old grandpa the grandpa at  thanksgiving situation where i was just kind of nodding off and the next thing i know my  i'm i'm the weight of my head is now waking me up yeah yeah it was like a bobbing staring at me  and clapping when i woke up so yeah i don't know exactly what was said that i yeah i think i think  at some point um the dealer mouthed off a little bit to a baby girl who then uh dropped the c-bomb 
[00:11:30]  on the dealer  and and cute oh no oh and boy let me tell you but you know a female dealer will not enjoy the c-word  a female garbage collector wouldn't enjoy the c-word it was hey first of all it was hysterical no one  knows what the dealer said it was something like you know be quiet and play shut up and play it was 
[00:12:00]  it was like she was being snippy and too like come on come on come on how many people were at the  table you know uh at that point there were a lot of people that we had been playing with all night  like everybody was so pretty much there so i guess what i'm asking that so the table in general was  very cool with the conversation that was oh yeah no no no one had a problem and every dealer before  that so the only person that had a problem was the dealer do they switch out dealers every like  20 minutes i get it so we had a hell of a lot of dealers the whole night that no one had a problem 
[00:12:30]  was the only one that had a problem the second no one at the table folding their hands and like  nope all right the second this bitch sat down we could tell there was a problem so uh so now uh  she goes floor so now she wants security to come over so security comes over and now i i just see the  beginning of the end of this table so i stand up and i start just telling the dealer i go you know  right when you sat down i could just tell you were gonna be a bitch i said i could tell there 
[00:13:00]  was gonna be a problem what's the matter not having fun you have to sit there while everyone  else is having a good time and be miserable and wreck everybody's good time and then some other guy  at a table stands up and mouths off like keep it quiet over there and and we all turn around just  went shut up shut up mind your own goddamn business i'm gonna think that everything was smoothed  over and you were able to continue playing no we heard 24 hours you can't play for 24 hours at 
[00:13:30]  which point i think the c-bomb was dropped again it was a hiroshima and nagasaki how bad how mad did  they have to be at you to go we cannot take your money for 20 yes we don't want your money  wait so who came out the security guys uh yeah yeah the security guys come out and um they they it  was you know the guys with the badges and everything and told us uh we had to leave we had to leave the 
[00:14:00]  poker area poker area yeah we had it we had to leave and uh i i was just i couldn't get over the  point that this deal it was being such a a c um and then uh cashing out the chips noticed everybody  from the table was getting up and cashing their chips out and the guy comes up to me and goes  he goes but she was a real just bitch and uh he goes after you guys left the table it was just uh  you know everyone left it wasn't any fun again we were all having fun and she sat down and just ruined 
[00:14:30]  it reined it and that's what happens i guess i was i was passing chips was i doing that let's see  uh yeah you were trying to she called the floor over because you were passing your chips all right  you're passing but we were doing that like all night too you're passing your chips to what  i was passing my chips over to baby girl like if there were you know she had like a got a beat  you know i had a pretty good stack so i'd like pass over a few chips was that legal yeah why would 
[00:15:00]  they call the floor if you're giving money to someone that you're friends with in gambling exactly  i think they call it collusion or something oh really i have no idea something stupid like that  something stupid but uh yeah yeah and it was cashing out or something we're cashing out that was it  so i popped a few chips in the empty tray we were leaving the table at that point i guess we were  kicked out and she got all mad and to see where it dropped again and it was just great we just got 
[00:15:30]  the boot just got thrown out and then we had to wonder if we were going to be allowed in the next day  so uh there was a big long line for the the tables so i go okay just buy chips so we buy chips and we  walk to the back now you're supposed to give your name at the front and there's big set of televisions  and there's like a reception area you give your initials and you get put on the bottom of the waiting  list the waiting list was pretty long so i go just buy chips so we bought chips and i go all right  now now if just stand and hold your chips and just look pathetic so he walks to the back and i go to 
[00:16:00]  the guy because usually when your name is called you go to the guy at the back and say my name was  called so i go okay um two ac and uh ms uh we need um a table where name was just called he goes all  right picks up the computer and he looks he goes i don't see it i go this is the third time this has  happened uh since i've been here i go you guys need a better system he goes okay stand up against  the wall the second a couple open up um i'll get you right in and like within three minutes 
[00:16:30]  two scenes open up sat down completely cut everybody is that how it is like when i don't  gamble you're playing poker you actually they're still busy you have to wait on long yeah yeah a lot  of times it's got to wait sometimes it's a long time you're playing in the high you're playing in  in the in the in the good poker area or regular poker area regular poker area in high stakes though  it takes a long time too like it's just it depends on how many people there if it's a weekend if  there's tournaments going on they just don't have enough room to to you know get everyone playing 
[00:17:00]  yeah the brigada's built like a whole second wing right yeah yeah it's got they got a big nice  poker room but there's people that want to play poker more people that want to play and uh so that  was cool so then we realized that there wasn't this 24 hour rule they didn't know who the hell  we were from last night it didn't matter so we sat down and and played cards um although earlier  i do believe we came very close to being kicked out of a bar this is why i love monday one of these  one of these uh mondays anthony will not be here oh there's a few stories here i understand i hear it 
[00:17:30]  there uh we were hanging out in the bar uh me and danny hanging out trying to get rid of the hangover  from the night before by so a couple of bloody mary by drinking a little hair of the dog yeah  yeah a couple aspirin couple bloody mary's hanging out and then uh uh baby girl comes down and um  uh it gets proofed you know obviously gets proofed and uh everything's fine so we start uh you know 
[00:18:00]  drinking a little bit and then um she leaves to go to the bathroom comes back in and there's this big  black guy bouncer at the door who asks for her id and she goes like i just showed it inside  what you know what i showed it inside and then i guess he gave her a problem and i think she dropped  the c word wow same one or a different one it was no no no the c word but believe me that i think was  close so he's like out get out get out like oh this is problem and the little tiny hamburger said 
[00:18:30]  just come yeah i know and it's kind of funny because i saw that this was going into a bad place  so i'm like all right chances are we're probably going to get kicked out of there so as she's  arguing with the bouncer i just start shoving these hamburgers in the back then he's just trying  to get as much hamburger in his mouth as possible like i don't care if we get kicked out i just want  to finish the burger well she's of age so why wouldn't she just show again real fast  uh i don't know i i just i just think there was a problem just one of those i think the proof might 
[00:19:00]  have been inside i don't know okay i don't know but uh so i get up and start conversing with the uh  the bouncer gentleman and uh telling him everything's cool don't worry about it i go to my friends and  everything and blah blah blah blah i'm just like telling him and uh he's like he's like i want some  kind of apology or or she's not allowed back in i go all right just just hang out just hang out so i'm  like eat the burgers quick he wants to go he'll think you're you're making one up right now so 
[00:19:30]  just like let's eat this quick she goes oh he wants an apology okay she walks over to him i don't hear  anything but i just see her face like in his face and her arms are waving up in the air and she goes  there i just apologized and and it was i don't think it was an apology i think she yelled an apology  at him it was yeah it was not the way she basically looked at him and just went you know i'm sorry if  you think i was giving you an attitude but i wasn't so if you think i was then i'm sorry and then just

[00:25:30]  to just move along but uh yeah you're right that is kind of bad uh  well then what happens um i decide for some reason uh this is after the poker debacle right  that um screw poker i'm gonna play me some craps craps never played craps in my life  but in my inebriated state i'm gonna learn that's what i'm gonna do this now i'm gonna i'm gonna withhold 
[00:26:00]  i'm gonna be able to retain new information so i go to the craps table with a few chips in my hand and  uh and the guy's kind of telling me what to do and and and how to make the bets so i'm sitting there and  and then i realize after a while that the gentleman has to tell me sir take your money  and as he tells me that i opened my eyes looked down and grabbed my money and put it back in front  of me so i i make a couple of more bets and again sir sir grab your money i was the second i put my 
[00:26:30]  chips down i was asleep standing up leaning against the craps table and you were winning yes  this guy's annoying everyone else this guy drinks sleeps and wins at the same time that's what was  happening so you're sleeping standing up waiting on the craps table winning and i was kind of annoyed  that the guy kept waking me up right can you just let it ride and let me sleep so uh i i then uh at

[00:28:00]  what i got was like uh eggs and sausage or something and then um i ordered a big fruit plate  and of course right asleep until i hear the knock i'm like oh food's here so open the door uh get it  so i'm laying in bed watching tv and i finished uh my eggs and uh uh my sausage and um put that on the 
[00:28:30]  the tray that they the little rolly thing they bring in and then i grab my fruit plate i put that down  and i start eating it and the next thing i remember is waking up it's noon five hours later it's noon  i wake up and i'm covered in fruit i'm laying in blueberries are smashed all over the bed apparently  i fell asleep with the fruit plate on me rolled over and just started crushing fruit all over the bed 
[00:29:00]  so i had a cantaloupe stuck to my arm and i just looked at it peeled it off and started eating it  because i was still hungry it was all over the floor and the bed had looked like i i had some kind of  digestive problem because all the blueberries because they just got smashed into the sheets  uh which made me laugh um so i i figure all right this is okay i'll just throw the crap on the floor 
[00:29:30]  there are people that clean up the maids come in uh so i grabbed the other pillows uh because i'm gonna  prop up uh my side of the bed so i can watch some tv i grabbed the pillows one pillow is covered  in egg yolk and underneath it is a perfectly full sausage under the pillow sure it was a sausage yes  it was a sausage it was a sausage i don't know how a sausage got under the pillow i was waiting for 
[00:30:00]  the sausage fairy i guess it didn't i i and i could swear i ate them i don't know what happened  you were playing some weird game and make get the sausage under the pillow clock in the morning  something happened i don't know what i just i crapped out i just you know what happened i know  what happened when i was eating the eggs the sausage rolled off the plate and i didn't notice  you're gonna die like william holden i'm really worried about anthony like you're gonna go to  click the clicker or use the the toilet at three o'clock in the morning and a pesky rug's gonna get 
[00:30:30]  in your way and we're never gonna see you again no you're gonna die with a sausage link in your hand  that's how they're gonna find you dead with fruit stuck to your body radio host found dead with  fruit stuck to his body uh no you do realize less than a year ago you were on jay leto right  yeah yeah all right no it's um you've had a an interesting year to say the least it's uh it was  fun and it's kind of and it worked because i really didn't feel all that crappy when i woke up because i  was eating and uh i suggest if you're hungover sleep with a sausage under your pillow it seems to work 
[00:31:00]  i noticed this is uh escalating yeah a little bit what do you think jimmy anthony's life escalating  a little bit a little more out of control a little more partying i go into i go through phases  i do that i uh except for you know drunken uh breakfasts at casinos i absolutely watch what i eat  i i uh go to the gym constantly so i take better care of myself that way but uh if i'm gonna be in 
[00:31:30]  atlantic city or on vacation or doing something for a weekend i'm not gonna sit around and uh not  have fun i'm going i'm going full blast balls to the wall that's right five days a week he's  responsible two to two and a half days and then it's it's just yeah lost weekend how about you get  nutty by having a piece of cake that is not nutty unless it's stuck to my ass when i wake up in the  morning how about you go on a nature walk nature walk yeah the leaves are changing it's oh it's 
[00:32:00]  wonderful no so what happened you just push all the food on the floor then all the food went on  the floor uh yeah they've made cleans it up they they don't question anything i'm sure they've seen  a lot worse yeah probably blood in the bed of a head blood with a 50 stuck to it something like that  and then uh no the next day was pretty much um you know there was drinking involved but it went  pretty smoothly we didn't get kicked out of any uh any of the gambling things um played some uh  poker did all right played some blackjack you know just a normal normal day woke up and then i left 
[00:32:30]  sunday um trying to beat the traffic and uh that was it a little a little uh rough getting through the  city with the uh the marathon thing going on yeah but it was pretty much over by then uh and that was  i got home wait wait wait uh blackjack that's your that's your poison how'd you do uh not well  not well uh borgata uh they took me they got me what am i gonna do though it's like first of all i 
[00:33:00]  can't win everywhere and for some reason that borgata i just can't seem to get a good foothold  there and uh how bad and take them um it was uh it wasn't as bad as uh i've won um i'm still up  but uh pretty good hit they uh i don't know what you wanted like uh well i don't like divulging  actual right right you know numbers someone finally gave you a talking to it's obvious  well i used to come in here monday bragging no i i'd you know brag about someone gave you a 
[00:33:30]  talking to and said ixnay on the losing say and the winning a let's just say it was probably a couple  of cars that you lost kidding well it depends on what kind of car kind of car yeah like how many  hyundai scion how many how many hyundai oh hyundai's it's probably five hyundai's was it more than an  escalade no no okay no not more than an escalade that's fine jeez that would suck literally it would  really suck i'd be hitching home more than an sts uh no oh no cts no no nothing no 
[00:34:00]  uh probably more than an escort yeah let's go to kenny it depends on what the car or the woman  i uh the the one thing though i when i got home um i was very very exhausted the drive the whole  weekend and everything that i hate when i do this i i went right to sleep and then i woke up at six  o'clock and yesterday yesterday evening okay and thought it was six o'clock this morning and that i 
[00:34:30]  was late for work oh that's just wonderful and i just panic what time did you go to bed i probably  went to bed about two maybe the afternoon yeah oh you're sitting at four hours yeah four hours and  then i woke up but it was still it was dark out and i just saw six and and i was like oh my god  i'm late no one called me and i and i get that panic moment then i realized oh no it's oh  and you went back to right back out you missed a great football game yesterday not that i missed 
[00:35:00]  a few but uh i think uh you missed uh the pats man coming back and beating the colts yeah i saw  the highlights the colts and the low lights from the jets game the colts controlled the game and  then brady comes back in the end and uh gets the big win for the boys come on in for the big win  yes come on in for the big win that colts team is tough i mean they're both tough  i mean it's it's unbelievable it looks like the coaches don't like each other at the end of the  game there was like a little uh little something going on as they were shaking hands at uh at uh 
[00:35:30]  centerfield there yeah centerfield geez at uh at um whatever at the place they go i'm just trying  to okay um so you missed that game it was great anthony they're calling it's what super bowl 41 and a  half or something like that yeah the super bowl will not be as good as uh that game was that was  both teams undefeated and then they go in it was uh close ending yeah stupid jets stupid jets  right i i and i'm pissed at you because you took uh you didn't take the bills i knew they were 
[00:36:00]  going to win that game yeah because you had your dumb football logic that's all i did i didn't say  it was going to work i just said what was your football logic you were taking the names of the  teams the names of the teams and what what would defeat what right i i i decided um uh redskins would  would be able to like hack up a jet so it couldn't fly anymore right and that's what happened yeah it  certainly did and you did take the pats over the colts yes so you were four for three for uh for my  football pick four for three i mean four and three four wins three losses four wins three losses all 
[00:36:30]  right you won four out of seven basically that ain't bad and uh it's not the best oh it was it was  strange how you picked the games and you did okay yeah better than most right football pick sponsored  by dish network it's time to get more tv from your tv sign up for dish network today but there you go  the pats still undefeated unbelievable hey let's uh go to the phones uh eight seven seven two one two  oh and a it's uh kenny in jersey kenny what's up hey can i speak to the skinny arty lang please 
[00:37:00]  shut up hey is it possible to set up a death watch maybe between anthony and arty lang on foundry  i'm very responsible i don't know i don't know if arty's doing drugs i'd heard that he was doing  heroin at one point which is bad anthony's just drinking i saw a picture of him in the paper and he  looked horrific yeah well really bad anthony says he's under control you gotta believe him i guess oh  yeah yeah you got him anthony's only drinking and falling asleep standing up yeah right anthony's not 
[00:37:30]  doing drugs honey sweet all right the beautiful thing is it's not like anthony fell asleep with  coke all over him or drugs he fell asleep in a fruit plate which is kind of encouraging i think on  some level yeah i guess it is encouraging i goes off all that jane fonda workout i was eating some  healthy fruit but you also got to remember this is stuff he's uh willing to share with the audience  yeah i'm i'm i'm imagining there might be a few other doozies in there no no doozies i don't know 
[00:38:00]  i think he would probably we probably if it was bad enough for him not to want to say it it would  have made the paper so that's a good way to look at it he admits probably true he admits to drunk  driving doing 100 miles an hour there's not much more all right good point good point when you're  right you're right let's say hi to matt in jersey what's up matt guys how's it going hey hey  listen uh my name is matt p i'm a compulsive gambler my last bet was june of this year  and i'm begging you to quit man you're still ahead right why quit are you still ahead yes or no are 
[00:38:30]  you still ahead uh yeah all right well just stay that way maybe go once a year you're just gonna  end up losing it i know so how bad was your gambling matt it was it was not as bad as some  people in my group but i'm telling you it was it was bad enough to where it's just hopeless you  know it just it's depressing come on you gotta stop does that does that weekend sound depressing 
[00:39:00]  that was a blast well you lost it didn't sound like i i didn't hear a lot of uh blackjack going on  sir the gambling part of it uh to you it seems to me like the gambling part of it was a big thing  like you lose you're depressed it's the it's it's not just about the gambling it's the whole  ambiance it's the whole experience of of being in the hotel casino and and just i used to love that  i used to love the whole thing i would say i'm home whenever i got there we closed my that's a 
[00:39:30]  problem i'm home because he had lost his real home to the casino they owned it you know what's weird  dude i don't drink and i don't gamble or i gamble maybe 200 for the weekend on machine i mean i  literally don't gamble and i love the casino yeah i worked the book i love the atmosphere they're  just great you know they know how to every little detail they know to make people just go like oh  this is nice but i don't i don't gamble no they know what they're doing yes they know exactly how  to draw you in and keep you coming they don't stop so do you stay away totally from the casino you 
[00:40:00]  never go right i don't go anymore i can't handle it i cannot handle it how much did you lose what  what was your biggest loss uh are you allowed to talk about that in gamblers anonymous i don't know  i don't want to break any of the rules no no it's about ten grand in one day that's a lot of money  man and you're just what kind of work do you do general i'm a limo driver all right so you got like  a regular nine to five you're a regular you're not you know a a rich uh guy you're just a regular guy 
[00:40:30]  that's right it's a lot of money ten thousand dollars man yeah sure anthony lost that in one hand by the  way matt anthony lost the anthony tipped the fruit plate deliverer that much no uh where would you  like this man just throw it on me i'd like a fruit plate what size uh medium could you taper that at  the shoulders let's go to arizona amy what's up i'd like a room with a king-size fruit plate  squish blueberries all over the bed i like a pillowcase filled with blueberries 
[00:41:00]  blueberries sleep in it hey amy what's up and all i could think of at that point sorry all i could  think of at that point when i looked was to go blueberries on my bed my bed is full of blueberries  it really is all you can say yeah uh uh amy in uh arizona hi how are you guys good what why are you  calling what's up well i heard the cue to call are you insane what is wrong with you amy  amy what do you mean you don't know the rules of the contest yet we've been doing this for a month 
[00:41:30]  amy come on go to ondayradio.com and read the rules  all right all right uh jim in new york what's up hey i wanted to know if uh anthony had put his  reservation under the name anthony fromia the sausage king of chicago i'm not the sausage king  yeah i'm chicago a sausage link under a pillow i don't know what's going on there but that 
[00:42:00]  seems to me it symbolizes something i know were you having prison dreams you just mind your keys  and cues buster and remember who you're dealing with  all right on let's uh go to dave in massachusetts call me sir god damn it dave what's up i was just  wondering how many wampum points anthony has racked up wampum points they don't give those away at the  borgata i am a black card holder though are you yes of course congratulations congratulations 
[00:42:30]  almost got thrown out of the joint but man this this show is getting stranger and stranger by the  day it's wonderful we all have problems yeah well all of us have problems yeah not necessarily the  same ones no we're very diverse you have your area covered i have my area covered you have your  area i'm perfect lately oh see see i'm just going after cb uh cbs executives according to radio  websites that's true anthony is uh an out of control uh gambler and uh jimmy almost lost his life to 
[00:43:00]  chris jericho on friday so we better we better talk about that oh i've i've seen some stuff that was  just written uh like i have i we'll get into it after the break but uh i have to explain myself  because a few people said that i ruined a great radio moment but i was uh i was not thinking about  radio for one of the one of the very rare rare occasions that happens every once in a while i 
[00:43:30]  actually stepped out of the whole freaking radio game yeah to save jimmy's life i think personally i  don't know if i don't know if i'm right maybe jimmy could uh you know uh uh tell us what he saw yeah  but it was getting ugly really fast there was something going on and it was real did we have  that clip yes it was all right it was very real yes because we haven't been able to discuss it since  it went down i haven't heard it and we like chris jericho front of the show but we got into a really  strange area uh that escalated really fast and i'm from awkwardness to like this um almost 
[00:44:00]  anger thing that was going on to it was weird it was just weird we'll talk about like i gotta say  one thing message board people some of them on the money and it's amazing how many people allow  their personal feelings to influence what they write like it really is amazing how many dumb people  there are who just are not perceptive all right we'll uh get into that it's it's definitely some  interesting stuff also uh god we've been on this for a long time and unfortunately now everyone's 
[00:44:30]  going to be on to this uh but uh jerry seinfeld on larry king yeah that we've been talking about this  larry king for i don't know over a year about how clueless the guy is he's losing his mind and we  don't understand why he's still on tv they should just uh give up and give it to anderson cooper at  this point and let larry retire he made 50 years of broadcasting but now this seinfeld video which is  one of the hottest videos on the internet is is blowing up larry's spot and it's something we've  been discussing for a long time yeah like larry's questions are lame and jerry seinfeld pretty much 
[00:45:00]  called them out on it and we got that audio for you next in case you haven't heard yet it's opian  anthony stay there hi what do you got um well i did actually my husband just heard the sound of the  day i was kind of getting my kid ready for the bus stop and i asked him this morning what  thank you i didn't even want to deal uh matt new hampshire what's up oh hey matt  matt hello all right he's i don't know people are trying to win the money already we haven't even 
[00:45:30]  played the clip and stop with the lame excuses because now it's like oh well i wasn't listening  but my my husband said you guys played it there was no husband say no there is no husband who do  think you're talking to he left he left like years ago this is a very ever getting off the phone with  the radio stations this is a very exciting time to listen to the opian anthony show  being perceived that we're a little out of control tom chia sound just walked in and 
[00:46:00]  and basically uh yelled intervention at anthony who's telling everybody that he has experience  with interventions and just say the word if if anybody needs and then i told him that was very  nice and i would want to be involved to help somebody and uh he looked at me odd well he probably  was surprised that you're offered generosity yeah i thought it was very nice yeah well i uh i looked  right at tom i go yeah he needs an intervention and then tom's looking at me like i'm not talking  about him and i'm like what did i do 
[00:46:30]  and then he started looking at jimmy i don't know what that was so now i don't know  everybody it seems everybody needs a little intervention i don't know what's going on  i mean anthony's the obvious choice but well at this point but that could change uh by tomorrow  i had a very healthy weekend did you did you i doubt that somehow did i was a good boy just did my  maybe on the outside oh internally it was it was a it was a suicide battle but externally you know 
[00:47:00]  inside it was waking up every morning just saying if you had a gun you'd finally do it see i think  that's where the problems lie i think um like like me on the outside what i'm doing overtly  uh jimmy is doing internally and covertly he's just kind of like this inner torment and toil  i had a good weekend a healthy week i woke up with my girlfriend and i i sang a pancake song 
[00:47:30]  you did not sing a pancake song and if you did i need to hear it immediately i don't know what it  was come on no you do you do remember what's your pancake song what's the pancake song something  like it's pancake time it's pancake time and that was it that's that's i mean who doesn't know what  the pancake song i'm sure there was another piece of that no no that really was it that was it yeah  it's time to get some pancakes it's pancake time see i see it's time to get some pancakes it's pancake  no it's a writer's strike you could you could fill in for paul shaver with ditties like that 
[00:48:00]  yeah paul shaver comes up with terrific stuff like the pancakes uh intervention blah blah okay  hey uh on friday show we had a a good friend of the uh of the show come in chris jericho he wrote a  book he's going back to the wwe told us off mike um yeah pretty much just confirmed it but there  goes the google alert in three two there it is every every wrestling sorry for all the people that have 
[00:48:30]  hoping anthony has a google alert thing because you're going to get wrestling news for the next  few days but uh so jericho comes in he wrote a really really funny book and uh getting uh very  good reviews and we were having a very nice interview on friday and uh talking about everything  wrestling his upbringing uh uh what else uh whatever yeah just everything that was in the  solid just hanging out type of interview yes and then um then all of a sudden it went drastically  wrong and we got the clip here and we haven't been able to analyze this yet because it went down 
[00:49:00]  for the rest of the show friday and then and then the show ended and took off to atlantic city we all  went our own way so we haven't really discussed this jimmy and i talked a little bit for a while  about the incident i have honestly not heard it i i've i very i have not listened to the replay i have  not heard this clip yet i mean obviously when it happened that was it you never know when this show  was going to go wrong so uh all of a sudden i i asked uh chris jericho about his father he his  father is uh an old ranger with a hockey player yeah yeah an old park ranger no what the heck was 
[00:49:30]  his uh father's name i don't know know the older rangers that well ted levine that's uh buffalo bill  yeah but i think it was ted levine that really is that name or ted levin what is it really ted  ervin yeah oh that's why all right ted ervin from uh the rangers right i i know nothing about  chris other than the fact that i know he's a very famous wrestler right uh i don't follow wrestling  so i just i know who he is because he's just got a he's a big name guy right and uh you need to know 
[00:50:00]  that i knew something that uh anthony and jimmy didn't about chris jericho that's in his book and  then we were going to try to maybe talk about it on our show i don't want to give it away but i kind of  knew something it was obvious jimmy didn't and anthony didn't so i i we were talking about hockey  and then the obvious question he's from kennan i'm like did you ever play hockey your father was uh  you know in the nhl played for the rangers chris jericho did you ever play hockey and then uh this is  what happened i actually played in a celebrity christopher reeve used to have a celebrity game 
[00:50:30]  at the garden i played four years with it it was great but the one year i asked my dad jimmy my dad  jimmy's itch i don't know don't around chris he was a good dude yeah why would i i can see your  wheels spinning not at all the third annual blink off oh my god terrible everybody's going you know  what christopher reeve in a wheelchair could still kick your ass not a big deal good for him  great answer i thought you were supposed to be a comedian that wasn't funny but anyways i have a 
[00:51:00]  story about it you jackass don't interrupt myself i can't even tell the story now it's been built up  so much he's really mad at me well he was a friend of mine you don't talk about someone's friend like  that yeah well that's true but he was a very famous guy and you know we poke fun at it and you know  we do it it's not that it's nice but we do it ladies and gentlemen jimmy gets his ass kicked  you see right right there i really did feel awkward because i didn't mean to trash the guy now we're back  live i didn't mean to trash his friend because i felt bad that i just smashed his friend and didn't 
[00:51:30]  realize it christopher reeve yeah i didn't know that it went a lot deeper than that oh no i know  at that moment so he said he's a friend of mine and then i'm like then i did backpedal i'm like oh  you know it's like it's like if you get it's like if you're watching tv with somebody and you go who's  the fat whore and they go it's my wife oh yeah it's like one of those moments so i felt bad um but he  got explosively not explosively dangerously but he got really pissed off at me you jackass like that  was real anger that wasn't he wasn't being he wasn't being uh fun he was genuinely angry at me 
[00:52:00]  right the line hit very close to home and uh you know i don't know everyone has their their own  definition of comedy and all that i my definition is simple that people are fine with things until  it hits too close to home absolutely and even that stuff should be fine you should just deal with it  and and uh let the moment pass and move on but for some people they can't like if we make fun of uh  give me something fat people and you're married to a fatty it personally affects you and you're not  laughing at that so one time i was a passenger in a car and um i sat down and went to put the 
[00:52:30]  seat belt on and it was all the way out like to the end of the seat belt and i buckled it and i swear  i could have put like three watermelons in there with me in the uh the seat belt and as i pulled the  thing i turned to the guy that was driving i was like like who the hell was what what fat lady from the  circus was sitting here you know as i tightened it up just because it was so far out there not  thinking and he's like oh uh my mom oh i was just and then i was thinking why would i say that 
[00:53:00]  like it was even his agenda right oh i'm sorry yeah so obviously if you listen to that clip uh jerko was  uh pretty heated yeah but i think it's fairly obvious that i was like well he was a famous i'm  trying to explain myself because i did feel bad that i just insulted the guy's friend even though i mean  i have that stupid sense of humor right i did feel bad that i said it do we have more so then it  continues i i hope this is uh the big reveal i don't know if it is though let's uh play this 
[00:53:30]  right after these words the host of the show the your bosses yes are being respectful awesome  and you got across the line when i said don't say it well i wasn't being disrespectful yes you were  it's very disrespectful you didn't i'll be honest with you i was uh this close to being disrespectful  but jimmy jumped on on it first but no he but you didn't say first of all you didn't say you were  friends with him you just said you played in a tournament i'm just i'm just kidding with you  man i was actually gonna go stop it right there please one second stop it he wasn't he wasn't 
[00:54:00]  kidding and that's what bugged me it's like i hit a nerve without meeting to yeah but he wasn't  kidding he was genuinely pissed off at me and when he was saying like i'm just kidding man then it  makes it look like if i'm still annoyed then i'm a jerk but he wasn't just kidding yeah you're  annoyed but he was just kidding so you're the idiot he had a genuine reaction i mean look he's  a person i i said something i mean i'm not saying it's inhuman for somebody to ever be annoyed at  something i say it happens right but that's what kind of bothered me to say come on man i know you're 
[00:54:30]  still angry i can sense it but if you're home listening you hear chris going there you go oh  he's just kidding why is norton still mad gee norton can't take being criticized exactly that's not it  yeah i was sitting next to him yeah no one years old i know when someone's pissed off at me when  they're two feet away from me you're not 40 yet almost enjoy the rest of your 30s oh i'm having  a ball don't start telling people you're 40 you're not yet makes me sound wiser in situations like this  here's the rest of the clip first of all you didn't say you were friends with him you just  said you played in the tournament i'm just i'm just kidding with you man i was actually gonna go 
[00:55:00]  with the i could see your wheels spinning when he said that i was gonna go on that  is that the last of the clips that's too bad that's the last of the clips  really do we have more hopefully that was it you were yeah because a lot of people that like  jimmy's saying that listen to that go give jimmy crap like oh you can't take a joke meanwhile if you  were in the studio and saw like he was livid yeah he was livid and i obviously we all know jimmy he's 
[00:55:30]  not gonna back down to that when you shouldn't obviously right if he if he had said to me hey  dude that was a friend of mine i would have honestly said oh man i'm sorry i didn't know i  wasn't trying to be a dick like i really wasn't i wasn't it wasn't a matter of i don't want people  to think that i was i won't back down but i wasn't just trying to stand up to chris jericho because i  liked the guy yeah it wasn't a matter of trying to show him it was none of that it was i said something  stupid just being a comic that's what you do we everyone in the studio knew that i didn't realize he had a  relationship with him and even when i made that clear i sensed he was still very angry at me even 
[00:56:00]  though he was going come on i'm letting it go right but he wasn't and there was i mean he was mad and  there was a reason he was uh extremely uh uh affected by you know that line yeah because he's  friends and and and the stuff that we didn't know and opie may have enlightened us a little to that  beforehand well i didn't know we were going down that road and and it's also got to point out that  jimmy was five feet away from jericho he was heated and at any moment he could have snapped i i saw a 
[00:56:30]  situation where he could easily snap and i know jimmy where jimmy isn't gonna let up he's gonna get if  he knows he's you know yeah he's getting to you and you're gonna like call him out and stuff jimmy's  gonna like you know show him show how good of a comedian he really is well i felt i felt and i i i was  convinced you had three or four other lines you were ready to go with well not and the thing was it was  like i i really did on some level feel like all right man i hit the guy close to home without  meaning to he's pissed off at me okay i just didn't want him denying that he was pissed off at 
[00:57:00]  me at one point he goes well how you know how why do you look like you your feelings are hurt  but they weren't i was being quiet the interview was continuing and then i'm like i think i said like  i'm not hurt i'm annoyed and then he said what are you annoyed i'm letting it go it was almost like  it was like that perpetually bringing it back thing when i wasn't jumping in and starting with him  and he kept saying that you were annoyed and like hey let it go let it go and meanwhile him  saying that led me to believe that he had more of an issue with it than you did but then every time 
[00:57:30]  he would say that jimmy would get more annoyed at him because he was being like yeah that's  aggressive yeah and and the thing was it was like he was pissed off at me he probably wanted to smack  me in the face i mean a guy like that is a he's a you know he's certainly a type of guy he's a man's  man he doesn't i believe he wanted to i i do too and i also believe uh just one more line from you  and it would have happened i really do i think it was the closest we came to having a fight it's  been a while since we've had a fight it's the closest you came to having a rape a massacre a  murder a beating a fight is not the answer and then i'm sitting there because i know the uh the 
[00:58:00]  little nugget of information and i'm sitting there like man do i would i spill the beans  they're going boy do i let this happen it'll be great radio and then i'm like but jimmy's my  friend i can't but i want to step in here i wasn't out to push him on that issue i really wasn't i  wasn't like gonna no you had every right but i think if you knew ahead of time why that affected  him personally i wouldn't have said it no yeah of course not i would not have said of course not  and and but even when he asked once i realized he was friends with chris reeve it was like uh all 
[00:58:30]  right that's gonna happen sometime yeah with a celebrity because christopher reeve was a celebrity  um but i wasn't rolling off the cuff here you know right i wasn't trying to push him on that  issue we're we're stalling by the way a little bit do we have that audio no will we have that  audio yes they're working on it all right give me like a eta more more importantly do you think  christopher reeve could beat you up in a wheelchair yeah no okay and that i i answered really snotty  there like yeah good for him only because i knew he was mad at me when he was saying well it was a 
[00:59:00]  weird line it goes he could still kick your ass like let's be honest that's christopher  reason i wasn't kicking it i don't think well i just i just knew that was a response to him being  mad at me i couldn't understand why he was mad at me at that point that was like the first line  after i was like why is he mad at me when when you said and i love the way you say that yeah good for  him because i wasn't it was like it was awful i love it i that was but that was just a response i  knew the guy was right it was very awkward hey uh maureen on long island what's up  uh i was hoping to win the contest jesus what contest did we you know what you know the one 
[00:59:30]  you have yeah and now and did you hear the sound um no i didn't but i was kind of hoping that it  was uh let's go to luke in miami luke what's up man that was one of the best shows i heard  in a long time terese was like that's the black gentleman terese right if i'm correct  patrice terese but patrice was on my right yeah patrice was loving it the white man of cnn  he was like keeping it yeah patrice did a great job of of uh keeping it light yes and and and but 
[01:00:00]  keeping it like real he he kept bringing the whole thing around he was analyzing both of you guys and  his inimitable style i told jimmy on the phone uh later on on friday i'm like uh it was a perfect  day to have patrice he was great it was a perfect day and he also sided with me which made me not  against he likes chris but as a comic he he said like you know as a comic man yeah that you know what 
[01:00:30]  i mean i'm sorry luke i'm sorry i just got rid of him because go ahead but it was almost like when  i feel somebody coming at me that way like where i again i didn't do anything intentional and i feel  like somebody genuinely angry at me it's like you know i mean i have patrice is one of my best  friends voss colin really just really funny guys who are very good at that so it's like when he  thought he hurt my feelings that genuine like what are you talking about dude you didn't yeah  irritated well do we have the next clip oh we'll have it in two minutes from two minutes it should 
[01:01:00]  be like any second okay matrice was just like a pimp or something i don't know what he was doing  big leather coat and that hat let's go to kathy in north carolina kathy hey hey  i've been trying to get in for years to what cool a coffin yeah well  let me congratulate myself pat myself on the back that's  i just want to tell y'all you were great and i want the money and i'll keep trying 
[01:01:30]  i want the money i want the gold i want the gold i want the money all right kathy you seem cool uh  we're gonna play the sound clip and uh i'm gonna stretch it out uh right uh right near the end of  this break so hang in there okay all right thanks we haven't played yet we'll play in a few minutes  wow people are uh definitely digging this sound contest for some reason terry in florida what's up  please hey how you doing fellas hey hey last week you had one of the hottest shows i'd ever heard and 
[01:02:00]  then you had one that made me the most uncomfortable i'd ever been listening to the radio  yeah great know why because at any moment it was gonna escalate into something pretty ugly  i really believe that i thought it was i didn't think it was gonna be a full closed fist punch but  i thought a bitch slap it was right around the corner i'm not gonna tell you i was not nervous  sitting next to jericho and and you know and the the thought of jimmy's headphones all spun around  on his head all askew and kind of wavering in his chair is funny yet uh it would have been tragic 
[01:02:30]  i uh you're arguing with a guy like that i'm sorry we're good yeah let me go jimmy you have a  protective thing like yeah we're both quote-unquote entertainers we're both on the radio but i don't  necessarily feel that because the bottom line is he's a wrestler and he's you know he's an author  now but he's still a man yeah i still realize that i'm dealing with a guy who is you know who  hit people with chairs for a living yeah big guy and yes a very aggressive guy those guys are all  like they're very aggressive males yeah you can't let somebody and again i'm not saying he was 
[01:03:00]  necessarily trying to he trying to hurt me but he was just i i don't like to be alpha mailed i i don't  like that because you know i'm a small guy and i've always had guys like that and i tend tend to be a  a dick when somebody is trying to i hear you jimmy i hear you let's play the third clip in the uh  in the uh confrontation here that was something i was going to bring up which time all right so  it was getting ugly and you could feel the tension and a few people on the the message boards had a  problem with me jumping in here but i'm sorry i really thought jericho was going to hit jimmy and 
[01:03:30]  i like jimmy if it was anybody else i'd i'd sit there and let it happen for the for the beauty of  it trust me i would but uh i'm not letting anyone and hit anthony i'm not letting anyone hit jimmy  eric eric eric can take care of himself and the rest of these guys but i i i was kind of bummed  because i'm like wow this is a really good radio moment but this is going to get ugly i have to say  something i have some knowledge that jimmy doesn't have and anthony doesn't you're right too by the 
[01:04:00]  way because when this happened after you said what you said it allowed me to know exactly what  bothered him so much and where he was coming from because i think you were confused by his reaction  extremely yeah because he chris jarko is a fun guy he he is a considered a comedian and he likes  to have a good time but this reaction of his was was over the top and continued even past the  the moment when you even were like you know chill out yeah it just hit him personally yeah all right  and let's get to the clip finally i'm sorry no something i was going to bring up which ties 
[01:04:30]  everything in your your mom's a quadriplegic that's right that's why he's a little sensitive  how funny do you think you are now mother wow now you feel bad don't you i told you to cross the line  no but i talk about suicide my friends have committed to it's it's like as a subject you  look at something like that you don't ever want to occur but that was something that obviously hit  you hard for that reason but you can't that's why like i'm being a dick on purpose because i'm not  this is very hits very close to home obviously so when you went there i was like wow this is gonna  be interesting that's all i'm saying let me say my father's a quadriplegic too well he's been dead 
[01:05:00]  for a few years his limbs don't work that's funny and then patrice is just like calm the f down that  was a very ballsy line by anthony yeah but does it sound like what i'm saying to him like i'm not  being a dick on purpose as a subject i'm really trying to explain myself i'm not saying f you or i'm  not trying to mother f jericho i really am trying to explain myself at that point because when you said  that it made complete sense it's a very personal thing for him yeah he just like had this internal  like anger about the situation that he didn't want and it happened out and it happened in a horrific 
[01:05:30]  way by the way most people would assume like a car accident or something but i guess uh she had a  boyfriend that uh did it to her let's put it that way yeah which was obviously which is just horrific  and yeah so maybe that hit like a real a violence or anything yeah but yeah again i'm trying to you  hear me explain myself i'm not jabbing my finger in his face i'm literally trying to explain  where i was coming from yeah so is that the last one we have i mean it goes on and on but uh we 
[01:06:00]  have the video clips where are they sam yeah the videos there's more on the video clips that we're  not discussing here yeah and you can come at sam's house you could see them on a big screen on a big  movie projector we could easily spend another half hour on this projection you can see in the in their  faces on the video like exactly like the points of annoyance for both of them can you see on the video  that he is genuinely mad when he's saying he's not oh yeah yeah yeah of course yeah he was at one  point i'm sitting chris the way we sit at the other studio is it's anthony it was jericho it was me  patrice on my right opie's in front of us so on my left chris turns towards me in his chair he's 
[01:06:30]  almost like a little kid in the chair because he has his feet up and he's yeah yeah gritting his teeth  at me and i can see like i mean you know as a male you have male instincts i'm like this guy  is very angry at me right now and just like you had said okay let's move on and then he was like  okay yeah we're all good and he started saying so like give us some wanky material some of your jokes  yeah yeah hey come on you're a comedian be funny it's like regardless of what happened as a comic  i'm not going to be taunted like that because you can't it's it's almost like you know you you can't 
[01:07:00]  be just like if i was jabbing him like that he certainly would have come back you know it's just the  jabs were going back and forth for the rest of the show and it was just underlying for the the next 45  minutes so i mean we could play the whole damn thing but we got other things to do today so check  out the video clips where are they sam yeah they're all on youtube now there's two of them um they're uh  they'll be on the onaradio.com at any minute now they've been sent over there so okay but yeah somebody  on a message board is like you know i hope norton doesn't start trashing jericho no i like jericho that's 
[01:07:30]  genuine i like the guy i think he's a great guest um i i wish it didn't happen but i'm i just  a little irritated that he thought he hurt my feelings no i was angry damn you just been pwned  that was kind of what i think that he was thinking what he thought like yeah but he was saying like  yeah do more wacky material or like than just point he kept rating my jokes now that was funny yeah  yeah yeah i know it's like he's good at that type of thing though that's one of his uh  this is traits yeah but there was a lot more that happened he he's he's good at being a dick when he 
[01:08:00]  wants to be his character in wrestling has always been like that well that's why too it wasn't that's  why it wasn't a work you know he wasn't sitting there putting on a wrestling thing it was the  real deal yeah i don't think that he i i again i'm not going to speak for chris but i think the fact  that he got so really angry at me you know what i mean like he kind of it's like when you when you  really are like you become that genuinely angry at somebody and then you just try to play it off like  no i wasn't that man i was just kidding but it's like come on man i feel that coming from you i'm only 
[01:08:30]  kidding with you it's but it's a tough one man right being in his position with a mom that's in  that uh situation so it's but had he said that not that you should have to preface every sentence right  with that but if he had said look dude chris was a friend of mine and my mother happens to be in that  condition and that really bugs me i would have immediately like i i tried to back off and me like  oh dude he's a famous i explained i would explain myself immediately and said look yeah all right no  of course i would have i'm not a jackass i'm really not but it just uh yeah it escalated and 
[01:09:00]  then patrice didn't help he helped the situation by like keeping it funny but he just kept it he kept  pounding it poking and then when he said jimmy is my favorite was when he said he commented that  jimmy was acting like jimmy for the rest of the show like you were trying to be jimmy norton the guy  on the radio but you were so far removed from that guy at that point irritated yeah i was very  irritated just looking at you go look he's trying to be jimmy norton look at him he was right i was  very irritated yeah oh you could say it and then we had uh red rum come in our pal talk friend and 
[01:09:30]  she flashed and then dirty awful patrice used my situation with jericho as a reason to like say  awful things to her oh yeah he tried to piggyback it was funny the way he like psychoanalyzed me and  chris and then immediately ping-ponged into an awful remark about her yeah like you sneak and then  everybody started uh using other people to make awful remarks about other people in the room  it was one of those amazing shows uh opie will look at you and go look at sam he's looking at 
[01:10:00]  anthony he wants to go you drunk yeah yeah opie always insults on a ricochet not always i go look  i have no problem doing the ricochet but i'll go right after right at you too it was it was i never  realized you did that though it's a brilliant tactic it was like because all of a sudden  and it's looking at sam like hey why would you say sam you asked meanwhile obie just insulted me  sam's like i'm not thinking that i don't even know what race i am one of my favorite things to do is  to be just vicious to your face and then at the end just give you like a slight wink like right 
[01:10:30]  oh that smooths it over oh yeah apparently but does it i think i think it adds a little more  insult to injury all right so i like i said we could i know we're gonna have to do one of these  days when we take a day off we'll have to play that whole thing yeah yeah because we could talk  about for another half hour but the videos are up there on youtube if you want to get a little more  of that and uh next time we take a day we'll we'll play the whole saga for everybody and uh nothing  against the uh the staff but i honestly was hoping that the uh line of the day 
[01:11:00]  would have went out that would have been the line of the day would have been the line that jimmy said  that got him so upset i honestly thought you guys are gonna do that but i wasn't sure that's one of  those calls though it's like this is either gonna be really funny or i'm fired i i didn't that's the  only way you get ahead in this stupid show we do line of the day and it should have been the line  that started the whole thing right yeah and i was i i was convinced the guys had balls to do it but  not even the setup just what jimmy said would have been fine discuss it yes and what was the final 
[01:11:30]  when we were discussing it it was about 30 minutes before patrice had started smoothing it over it was  really still tense in there right at the end of the show it would have made perfect sense everyone  laughing and saying oh this is funny but like it wasn't there yet and i don't know um maybe i need to  be more of a shock staffer all right we gotta take a break call um yeah all right we gotta take  a break um when we get back seinfeld and larry king yeah i love this you gotta hear this and it's 
[01:12:00]  something we've been talking about for a while on the opian anthony show we'll explain next stay  there hey this is chris jericho and you're listening to my little pal little jimmy norton isn't he  sweet isn't he cute don't you just want to kiss him  show's flying by today opian anthony  let's see who won the one thousand dollars today anthony what's up what's going on i was oh we got a 
[01:12:30]  lot of anthony's winning this contest that old gag i hate doing it but i have to every time anthony  what's up well i watch what's up guys hey anthony uh you won uh a thousand dollars and you're calling  from boston yeah a lot of boston winners lately go pats do you have to even say it at this point  and go celtics i i i decided something new by the way over the weekend what's that i was thinking about  how uh the guy's interviewing you huh i was just worrying and doing it i was just thinking that 
[01:13:00]  because i decided something over the weekend and i just sat here because he took a sip of water so  the guy's like well all right no one else well well ob what's that yeah well i continue my line of  questioning i like my sports a lot of us in this room like our sports and i was thinking over the  weekend why are we so loyal to a team when the team is not loyal to the fans or the players or the  the players especially could give a crap that you're so loyal for the most part because they're  you know they play for a certain team and then when their contract's up they're looking for the 
[01:13:30]  best offer possible and moving on they have no loyalty to the team they're on yeah but why as fans  do we continue to show that incredible loyalty toward like in my case the islanders the islanders  haven't won anything in over 20 years at this point the jets haven't won since what 69 70 i'm gonna guess  that most teams are local that people root for not all so that's all you got you're absolutely  right but with the internet and stuff you can follow any team you want back in the day 
[01:14:00]  one of the reasons you were so loyal because you couldn't get info from other teams for the most part  your local paper talked about your local might have scores and stuff but you really didn't know  players unless so where the hell did you get all that info back then so i want to start a movement i i  want to switch my loyalty every single year depending on the teams why should i why should  i follow the knicks they haven't given me a winner and i can't even tell you this year i follow the 
[01:14:30]  celtics so you're pulling the tack that's like people that buy lotto tickets but change their number  every week as opposed to the person that goes with the same numbers every week after week and this  what are the odds though you i i just want to follow a team that is a little more exciting than  my local team because i i'm done with being loyal to local teams just because i'm local gonna get a  shirt and everything hat i was thinking of wearing a red sox hat during the world series that would  have just looked insane right bandwagon it pure bandwagon which and that's important you say that 
[01:15:00]  bandwagon is like when it gets down to you know two teams then all of a sudden you become a red sox fan  yeah i want to like pick my teams before the season starts all right that's pretty good because  i was thinking about i'm sitting at the coliseum watching my islanders they have a pretty good team  this year and i'm like i've been freaking loyal to this team forever ever since i was a little kid  who knows yeah and just when you really start feeling for the players and stuff they completely  change the team on you like i mean i don't want to get too deep into it but the islanders pretty much  have four guys five guys from last year the whole team is new and i'm sitting there like why am i 
[01:15:30]  loyal to his team and the to a uniform you're loyal to the uniform i've had it so now i'm going  to start looking around and i want to pick new teams every year just like the players do players  pick new teams every year so why can't we the fans pick new teams so you're a free agent fan  free agent fan that's right look you're looking to uh be picked up by a team that's right the  celtics are going to be very exciting this year i know i'm picking a lot of boston teams lately but  they're doing the right thing up there red sox are a very interesting team to watch the pats i mean 
[01:16:00]  who doesn't love watching the pats at least play you know the celtics they got garnett their team  is stacked this year well too many people have to like when you said bandwagon there is nothing wrong  with just jumping around but too many people like yeah well why are you when they were losing it's  almost like who cares what you bleed giant blue do you like like that's that's your integrity you  cheat on your wife you cheat on your taxes but you're loyal to the giants why don't you die 
[01:16:30]  that's a good point that is people feel that unless you've stuck with them for years that you  don't deserve to right root on root them on the players don't stay with you for years no like when  we were growing up watching baseball i was a huge mets fan i knew the mets lineup because it didn't  change every once in a while they would they would throw one different player in there and i mean every  once in a while you would go almost year after year with pretty much the same nucleus of a team  so then when your team did win yes it was it was way more exciting because you did uh stick it out 
[01:17:00]  with these players you got to know them it was the same team right but now i i don't even know half  the islanders and i'm a season ticket holder and i go i go year after year so i'm like why am i loyal  to a team that doesn't give a crap about me what are you gonna feel loyal to alex rodriguez that dirtbag  and his awful vulture agent wants 300 million i'll just win something no no no no no the latest with  a rod he wanted 350 million dollar offer just to talk to the yankees just to talk just to talk give  me 350 million and we can talk no he says offer me 350 million then we'll talk but if you're not 
[01:17:30]  even gonna offer that then don't even talk he deserves to win nothing he's never won i think  wait look he's got 350 million dollars i'm glad he got caught in toronto what do you think of them  apples right jeter i don't like jeter but the guy's a very loyal guy to one team rivera i love guys  like that you gotta respect so i'm officially the first free agent fan free agent fan i am the  first free agent fan out there every year when the when a sport starts up i'm gonna decide what team 
[01:18:00]  i'm uh rooting for i'm done i'm done with the local teams done so as far as baseball goes who do you  think you're gonna sign with uh that's a really i gotta kind of study it a little bit you gotta study  it it would be tough to go yankees i like the red socks obviously wow i like the indians let's see  what the yankees do i mean this new regime that they did well he's got a pick before oh you mean  let's see what they do as far as getting players as far as how they're gonna run this no see it's  not about and don't confuse the issue it's not about wanting to uh jump the bandwagon every year 
[01:18:30]  and have a winner every year no i just want to be able to follow a team that's interesting every year  that's all like the jets suck really bad so i'm done with the jets i'm taking a peek at the pats i'm  taking a peek at the bills even though they're kind of in the middle of the pack right now and  i'm taking a pick at uh brett farver and the green bay packers but brett farver and i'm i'm starting  to look at uh maybe maybe some jerseys and hats i'm trying to see what i might want to start wearing 
[01:19:00]  and i'm the first free agent fan ever ever because there's no loyalty it's not someone admits it there's  no loyalty i'm gonna be in a sports fan year after year for the same stupid team i'm gonna root for the  baseball team that has the best bulges high fives guys all around come on no i want to stop i like a  loyal i like a team that gets like nice young players that's what i like no but i mean i like  that league yeah you know if you don't if you don't have a list i'm not buying your uniform  i'm uh i'm i'm taking a peek at the pats the packers i'm taking a peek at um the celtics and i like 
[01:19:30]  the cavaliers because i think lebron james is amazing and i uh and hockey i i this will be  uh a year i will root for my islanders but next year i might go free and see with uh with hockey  as well i fan i don't think you could change football right now you got to stick out your  jets no but i kind of hinted at that early in the season did you yeah yeah i was gonna say it's a  little little late to to jump off your jets there and why would you go to a jets game at this point 
[01:20:00]  seriously uh if they were playing a team you wanted to see stop i bleed jet green they're one  yeah good they're one in a station you zilch they don't have their own they don't care about you at  all leon hess the best he named the gas company after himself the best is when your team wins like  the world series or the super bowl or something and then they can't even give the rings to the  players the next year because half of them are on other teams yeah they have to come back and give  them to them individually one year one there so why i was just thinking about it over the weekend 
[01:20:30]  why are you so loyal to these teams when they're not loyal to us in return the players anyway it's  fun to watch your team you know win and lose i think people like to be heartbroken too i think you  like to go right to the edge and get your smash back like there is something appealing about that that  horrible letdown as well i i think it's because you're hoping that they're they're gonna win and  then if you've been through so much adversity with your team and then they they do win right like  the socks uh when when they first won it was just huge yeah it's huge but if you you know you get a 
[01:21:00]  team that's consistently winning like uh the pats i mean it's all good and they're doing great and  everything but you know they make it to the super bowl is anyone really going to be going oh geez can  you imagine hey the pats made it you can be like oh yeah again okay well they're exciting to watch  though man that brain yeah i mean yeah but but you you're not getting that level of excitement that  you've followed this downtrodden team that made it right to the big game you know you're kind of 
[01:21:30]  like this is expected well the patriots are so good you're like watching them like the the joy in  watching the patriots and i believe me i despise them but he spies the patriots but the fun of  watching them is like all right this is one of the best teams ever put together right it's kind of  fun watching a team yeah you're watching a well-constructed team hall of fame players  it's kind of amazing such a great team yeah and how many touchdown passes that does uh brady  gotta have five already uh perhaps more than that jim yeah thank you povember uh you got to get a 
[01:22:00]  sound clip for the thousand dollars for tomorrow by the way let's say i have one oh uh go ahead what  what are the people listening for tomorrow if they want to win a thousand dollars between seven  seven thirty here it is oh and a party rock there you go when you hear that seven seven thirty  tomorrow you're the 10th caller you win the next one thousand dollars up for grabs party rock indeed  and all these sounds are up on onaradio.com every day uh brian toronto what's up hey opie you gotta 
[01:22:30]  come into our side toronto is the place to be for the toronto maple leaf forget the islanders  come on toronto what a fruity little stupid you know what i uh i crossing any borders to  well my favorite islander jason blake now plays for toronto so brian might be on to something  and ty domi even when he was uh like fighting islanders at the coliseum i couldn't get enough  of ty domi back in the day the guy was an animal he was an animal he was like a five foot five 
[01:23:00]  animal on the ice it's just stupid then look up ty domi on youtube if you want to see some fun fights  oh yeah he takes two guys on at the same time yeah he didn't care he fought every single game  there was some guy at the casino uh thanks a friend of one of the players and i think he was on the uh  from the um the flyers and he he just a a monster it's this huge guy missing front tooth and he's just  standing behind his buddy his buddy was talking about how he's suspended right or something i i saw 
[01:23:30]  something bad i saw my loyalty start to go away with a lot of teams the islanders they still got  the loyalty for absolutely but the mets i you know i say i'm a mets fan i didn't watch many mets games  this year yeah i say i'm a knicks fan but i haven't been to massive square garden for a knicks game in a  couple seasons i haven't been well i went to one jets game last year a lot more uh i used to go to a lot  more but it just kind of went away because this whole thing was happening in my head i'm like why am i  loyal to these teams when the players change every single year just because i live in the new york 
[01:24:00]  area i don't go to games i've been to a yankee game since 95 it was jib layricks home run game  who i loved jib layricks until he was rude to me yeah um the people like why don't you go to games  it's like i don't know because they don't take off to watch me like i i never heard much as i love  the yankees i never heard posada go look joe i'd love to play toronto this week but norton's doing  caroline's yeah on friday wouldn't that be nice if posada said norton's doing this stupid  myspace show at caroline's it's friday it's seven and it's free yeah i'm gonna go to it but good 
[01:24:30]  plug huh jimbo you shouldn't be announcing a surprise show ever no it's not a surprise show  which one's the surprise show the friday one but it's a it's a week out okay i'm sorry and hbo's  giving away free dvds all you gotta do is show up with your myspace profile very nice nice hey by  the way best ty domi moments coming in from hoffman and uh from whack bag uh when he climbed the glass  in the penalty box after he was put in there because he he fought on the ice he climbed the  penalty box and fought a fan in the stands the guy is an animal and like at the coliseum when he fought 
[01:25:00]  like people would be booing and i would just be smiling in the stands i love this guy how insane he  was people just loved watching players goon it up like that yeah let's uh let's say hi to anthony in  new york anthony what's up hey what's going on thanks i know i i can totally respect the uh you know  um not being loyal to your home team uh necessarily but i don't think any self-respecting jet fan could  ever root for like miami or the patriots or the bills or something like that i was explaining this 
[01:25:30]  over the weekend too you want to know my three favorite uh nfl teams are who and it's all because  i lived in these areas so i'm kind of torn i lived in western new york for over 10 years i went to college  at geneseo did radio in buffalo did radio in rochester so i i i love watching the bills i was a  bills fan when i was up there because i wasn't getting my jet info i'm from new york so i like  the jets and ready for this oh i like the pats because of the three years we were up there 
[01:26:00]  yeah they're all the same division how stupid is that but those are my three favorite nfl teams that  is a fact i can totally respect like and like the the pack is great the seattle some a team like that  you got you know you gotta you gotta love them you know but yeah i just can't bring myself to say  oh yeah you know i i really would like to see the uh patriots go all the way yeah i'm in a weird  position because of uh you know i lived in all those areas and right and when i lived in all those  areas i was convinced i was gonna live there for the rest of my life so it's just a strange thing 
[01:26:30]  i lived up in binghamton for a while and it was the same thing you know i was only getting  those games and i kept like like where are my jet games and i couldn't get them right but you know  so i can i can definitely see where you're coming from i became a syracuse football and basketball  fan as far as college goes because my year's up there so it's just i mean i'm not saying anything  crazy here this happens to a lot of people out there they move somewhere else and they start  following the local team uh thank you anthony let's uh uh you're welcome let's say hi to david  in cleveland what's up dave hey love you guys love the show thanks hey i just wanted to know you know 
[01:27:00]  baseball has a uh you know july 31st football i think it's like the second week for trade deadlines  is there a trade deadline for uh sports loyalties for uh the fans i think if you're gonna be a free  agency fan i you can't be like you can't jump on a bandwagon like late in the season you want yeah  i mean i want to go with a team that has a chance and has an interesting team so you got to pick it  early in the season certainly but those but the team's dynamics could change at those deadlines and 
[01:27:30]  you might say hey you know i was rooting for you know you said ty domi you know if he went to a  different team you might want to follow him oh i hate the maple leafs i hate toronto but i see  what he's saying i like ty domi as just a insane hockey player like if you wait too late then it's  like oh you know all the players there's a little risk involved if you choose early or maybe you  might lose a few of those key players maybe you should be able to change week after week why not  wow that's now you're talking insane all right thank you dave people get mad at me when i when i 
[01:28:00]  watch games but i have a whole bunch of different caps and they're like who's your favorite team i'm  like who won last week that's my favorite that's my favorite and i'm sassy about it yeah uh i would  get so i would get so like like your stomach would be churning watching your team lose and then i'd sit  there and go why why why do i give a crap why am i getting myself in a tizzy because these jackasses  that don't know me from a hole in the wall uh can't play the game oh can i say those dirty cowboys 
[01:28:30]  who i've been a fan of since i was a child uh the worst feelings ever have come from dallas lost  yeah literally i would cry when they lost when i was a kid oh jimmy relationship on thanksgiving when  stupid leon let kicked the ball into the end zone when he kicked the ball and it got recovered by the  dolphins because he slipped in the snow in dallas it never snows in dallas and i threw something and  put it through my door and the girl i started dating says i have to leave and she left my house on  thanksgiving if she realized she was dating a potential rapist a lunatic yeah but this all uh 
[01:29:00]  i thought about because i was at the coliseum they had al arbor night he's the legendary uh islander  coach yeah and they figured out that he was one game short of 1500 games coach for the islanders so  they got the bright idea to have him coach a game even though he's 75 and he came out on the ice and  he just kind of stood in the uh so ridiculous he just stood with the team for the whole night didn't  really make any moves or anything he was just there it was just a nice gesture by the islanders  absolutely and then after the game they had this big celebration where they raise a new banner to  the top of the coliseum and i'm sitting there looking at the players because they're trying 
[01:29:30]  to show like tradition the islanders this tradition man you know they won four stanley cups back in the  day and it's all about tradition and and and and and and rooting for your team right and and i see  the islanders the current islanders out there as they're doing this big huge ceremony at the end of  the game i'm like half those guys could give a crap they don't understand tradition they don't  understand tradition in this day and age there's no tradition half these guys have been on the uh  the team for 10 games they don't care they don't have that tradition it's not like they've been 
[01:30:00]  on the team for 10 seasons and they and they feel it in their bones you know i'm like why why as fans  do we do this there's one more then we can move on let's uh go to mike in arizona mike what's up  hey guys we were just talking about this uh over the weekend it's it's the owners in a lot of uh  cases that are doing this to us i moved out here to phoenix a few years ago and it was great to be  in a four sport town and then the diamondbacks win the world series as basically in their like third 
[01:30:30]  or fourth year and the very next year they tore the team apart and sent the players all over the  country and there was no chance to get going again yeah there's many examples of that where uh some of  these owners just can't afford the team anymore so they win the world series and then the next  year the the team is completely different clean house so you can't even have that enjoyment of  like wow this is my team they won the world series and the next year should be just a every game should  be just that you know fun and celebrating atmosphere you think it's like a new thing but 
[01:31:00]  i as i recall wasn't wasn't the 86 mets just like dismantled after uh i believe they were  i think howard johnson was the first big trade they made or let go and it was like that was a dumb  move because he was there was a chemistry thing that team was great yeah yeah i forgot now but  i think anthony's honest i think they ended up uh trading a bunch of the yeah a few of the players  just went and then it was like you know the next year like where's the world series team because you  wanted to see if they could do it again right and you know it wasn't the same players and chemistry 
[01:31:30]  i think if this free agency fan thing catches on it would make the owners try harder to like you know  to do the right thing and keep some of their players too like the jets one and what are we one and eight  yeah i suggest no one goes to any more jets games this year hurt their bottom line and and announce  that you're rooting for like uh somebody else a little incentive yeah just totally take out your uh  your your uh loyalty for the the second half of the season one morning i woke up one morning and  all of a sudden randy johnson is a yankee right oh my goodness gracious randy johnson yeah i know 
[01:32:00]  yeah we knew randy johnson was a yankee when uh he dissed jimmy for an autograph on the street  ah this is what i remember about daylight savings time the sun in your eyes like i'm driving i need  a sun visor here on my microphone just to flip down all right thank you mike have a good day guys  all right yeah it's better free agency fan i'm the uh i'm the first official one nice my idea i'm not i'm 
[01:32:30]  one we got to get to that larry king stuff all right yeah we'll do that at the break you got  the sound again for people uh this is the sound you'll be listening for tomorrow between seven  and seven thirty for your chance to win one thousand dollars here is the sound oh and a party  rock really annoying that's for uh povember he did that during mardi gras right oh who wouldn't  yeah okay and i think we got the drew uh the drew boogie on a party rock remix i wish a levy had 
[01:33:00]  broken right at that moment no kidding just we're gonna play this going in a break when we get back  it's uh seinfeld and larry king pointing out something we have been pointing out for a long  time larry doesn't listen and he's uh he's a bit older now and he needs to step aside and just  finally give it to anderson cooper it's over we noticed this a while ago way back with the motley  crew the motley crew we'll finally get into that for their first get together yeah get together 
[01:33:30]  get together that's right get together yeah rock bands don't do get together larry it's opie and  anthony that tom cruise haircut is creepy you're just talking about tom cruise on the tv yeah  amazed with all the flashes that go off no man no matter where they are he's got like a little boy  haircut or something i know it's for a movie but he just looks creepy oh is that for a movie i believe so  yeah it usually is when an actor walks around with some wacky hair dudes first of these was 
[01:34:00]  really i think so yeah i just i looked at these comments forward and to me it looks like it's a  really well done view to avoid uh they had like all the rules now i think it's the same thing oh really  yeah my opinion and then people are uh saying wow katie holmes ran the marathon yesterday  in new york city wow wow five five and a half hours it's not running  i'm not kidding i could do it tomorrow and i'm not even in good shape that's like a slow jog it's  like that's easy well they had a picture of her after she crossed the finish line and she wasn't 
[01:34:30]  sweating i understand it was nice and cool out it was like the perfect day for a marathon but uh  i don't know you would think you'd have some kind of beat of sweat or maybe something on your shirt  maybe she dabbed it yeah good for her i don't know what she was accomplishing i mean the the picture  i'm seeing on tmz she's next to a guy that uh looks like he's walking so she's next to yul brenner  and that guy's walking and she's in full you know full running yeah yeah she's got like the full run 
[01:35:00]  pose her arms are up and everything and other people are just kind of walking look yeah whatever  good for her i guess it's an accomplishment i guess yeah stupid scientology i wish she would  have fallen in a manhole say i was a runner back i was a runner back in the day and these like five  and a half hour six hour people it's like stop the marathon should be ah give it four hours after  that just go sorry you weren't good enough go home don't let everyone finish these marathons 
[01:35:30]  because people could walk 26 months what's the accomplishment uh you could say that you were in  the marathon but what is truly the accomplishment of that unless you're some kenyan me and my brother  walking around on the up west side yesterday and you see all these marathon uh runners after the  marathon they're wearing these like silver wraparound they look like capes they're obviously keep you  warm yeah and it was really funny it was like they had their medallions on it's like hey stupid  you're not a warrior returning from battle they were walking around like yes i'm one of the few 
[01:36:00]  who you're one of the 40 000 that ran with nobody chasing them you're an idiot i'm so glad you're not  a warrior i'm so glad someone's saying it because all weekend they were talking about these people are  warriors and i'm like stop no there there's if they had any balls it's like even four hours but go  four hours that's it after that you have to stop right where you are and get on the bus the loser bus  there are a few people really making accomplishments there and those are the professionals and the 
[01:36:30]  kenyans are just ridiculous they sprint for 26.2 miles it's amazing the winner came in at uh what two  hours and uh nine minutes that's like the uh under a five minute mile somewhere around there  mile after mile know what katie holmes averaged about 12 minutes a mile you could walk that i'm  still impressed with her doing i mean that's a long way i could run that far but don't be impressed  jimmy stop being impressed please we could put you out on the course tomorrow and you would do five 
[01:37:00]  and a half hours you couldn't even with your bed i can't run that far i would just collapse it's not  really running my little legs i've run i've already run a race my little legs would not do it  it's not really running i do i did an eight minute mile with my dad because my father was a marathon  runner was he really yes he ran the marine corps marathon new york boston many the core yes and uh  my dad i did a race with my dad and i did an eight something minute mile and my dad gave me a trophy  with a little jogger on it really yes where's that trophy now huh it has to be surgically removed yeah 
[01:37:30]  yes well i don't know where it is he fell on it while changing a light bulb it's a stupid i knew my dad  just made it for me because they don't give out trophies to schlubs i even knew that then he had  a long sleeve shirt on when i did it i was just out of my mind he was proud of old jimmy hey uh booby  man from brooklyn he writes op i just picked up uh your contract i'm a free agent uh fan there right  yeah uh you're now a fan of the little neck diggers the nine-year-old uh football league  go now go root them on do they get away with a name like that what is it we're a little neck diggers 
[01:38:00]  maybe oh maybe made up the name oh okay sorry but i'm already rooting for the uh the panthers in  the nine-year-old sound clipped out at the beginning somewhere i thought wow oh yeah jeez  oh stupid stupid me wow larry king thing i've been here yeah here we go i heard it so jerry seinfeld  was on larry king promoting the b movie thing his first real project of what how comedian so  it's called comedian you're a movie b movie it's called b movie and uh yeah i saw him doing one 
[01:38:30]  publicity thing where they had him up on a big crane harness and he was dressed in a big b suit  i was like oh jerry what's he doing i kind of like it though it's just silly it is very silly  he's a funny dude but uh this thing of course an animated uh feature will probably make a bloody  fortune number two at the box office behind american gangster yeah was it really yes i believe so  39 39 mil and then these things in video just go ridiculous ridiculous amounts of money so so it's 
[01:39:00]  on larry jerry and the big thing here is we've noticed that larry king is pretty much clueless  yeah well he has been quite a while for a long time but most people don't talk about it but now  with this video that's all over youtube and break and stuff uh i think a lot more people are gonna be  aware that larry king is just ready for retirement yeah finally and jerry was having none of it no at 
[01:39:30]  least jerry's like he's not like a normal guest that goes on there and just all right larry's senile  or something i'll just take it plug my stuff and leave like jerry points these things out which is  great and larry's questions just suck i need a writer you're an american gangster tell us about the  movie anyone can do that yeah i thought he was on tv for 50 years because he had something  something different interesting questions that it's like oh wow i never would have thought of  that but that's why he gets paid for what he does because he can come up with these interesting little 
[01:40:00]  tidbits right well we've been making fun of larry for a while well let's uh get right to the clip  larry king asked why the movie took so long jerry points out he isn't listening that larry king  isn't listening of course here we go finally this movie well you may seem like you did the  work no no but four years gone with the wind took three did i bother you was i bothering you no i  bothered you a little bit yeah okay why did it take so long they're not very good at this  the bees are not really no the animation of people they're not kidding it's hard to make animated 
[01:40:30]  movies because they're basically puppet shows it's a gigantic insane puppet show and every character  has hundreds of controls and you have to control them and you you know in comedy you got to get the  facial expressions just right you'll see see that look on his face get a shot of that we worked it to  get that exact look that kind of i'm listening but i really uh i'm thinking about a bagel look that you 
[01:41:00]  they didn't get the shot he still doesn't get that he's being insulted  they didn't get the shot seinfeld good for him yeah but you want a bagel  why does it take so long he has no clue what goes behind making that he thinks it's like the old  walt disney studios where they're drawing some like like uh cartoon characters it's all computerized  it's computer-based and like jerry said there are hundreds at least controls on every character 
[01:41:30]  to to make those facial expressions that's why they're so entertaining to watch the movements and  everything the the skin texture and the fur things like that like he doesn't understand that for  for a second of of actual screen time it's going to take days but someone that's been broadcasting  for 50 years should understand this when did he stop doesn't when did he stop learning about  he stopped the new technology why would you say why did it take so long why you know the 
[01:42:00]  flintstones were on uh every week they pumped another episode out jerry why your cartoon did  it take so long answer me why don't you just have the same tree and couch go by a thousand times  while they're running running in their house running in the house why was the flintstones house  endless jerry comment how come fred when he ate took a bite out of something and there was never more 
[01:42:30]  than one bite mark no matter how much he ate why would he order ribs that flipped his car over jerry help  me please comment why didn't the dinosaur he rode just eat him  all right here's i remember dinosaurs they never acted that way you couldn't put a little house on  the back and make them carry rocks believe me i tried all right here we go we're leading up to 
[01:43:00]  the clip that everyone's uh been checking out but first seinfeld explains why he likes bees larry  points out they sting people seinfeld then explains uh that self-defense larry follows up by asking if  seinfeld will do another movie right they look down on the other insects they deal with honey and  flowers it's a very sophisticated life but they sting people well you know you got to protect yourself  oh that's right you know every every animal in nature has a form of self-defense so you won't 
[01:43:30]  survive when you do another movie who's asking me for you no no no for a major studio perhaps no i  don't know i have no i never planned anything in my career that's great for you no good so snotty  isn't he he's he's irritated he's probably irritated this moron is asking awful questions he is  irritated yeah he's finally doing like a major tv appearance on cnn and i don't want to do larry 
[01:44:00]  he's being asked dumb questions that any college kid in broadcasting could have asked oh he picks  and chooses what interviews he does oh absolutely he chose this one and stupid larry king and his dumb  backdrop he's done light bright my light bright backdrop it's called b-movie this is what larry  says the b-movie opens tomorrow everywhere um when you're doing stand-up oh no you know reaction  right away they laugh or they don't how do you know how do you get reaction from an animated movie 
[01:44:30]  when you're sitting in a soundstage sometimes you don't sometimes you have to guess sometimes you  just have to throw a dart in the dark and hope you hit something uh what what did you hit the 20 or the  bullseye you're talking darts no it's like kind of a metaphor i think what is that a metaphor  shut up you old fool just sits there babbling these dopey questions and jerry ain't yeah jerry 
[01:45:00]  thank god he ain't taking it the b-movie isn't it just b-movie yeah the b-movie opens tomorrow  the b-movie the b-movie the b-movie what's it about and don't forget do i have to remind you  the b-movie opens tomorrow all right we get it all right and here's the clip that uh is all over  the internet jerry's insulted that larry king asked if his show was canceled this is larry king 
[01:45:30]  he's been in broadcasting for 50 years how does he not know anything about seinfeld how do you not  know that uh jerry left on his own terms how do you not know what they offered him some like five  million that was huge to continue and and jerry said no it was huge headlines people were like i  cannot believe he turned down that money uh you know to do other episodes he decided to leave it where  it was at lasted how long nine years 180 episodes you gave it up right i did they didn't cancel you 
[01:46:00]  you canceled them you're not aware of this no you're not aware of this  and i read a lot of comments over the weekend is that great and people thought that jerry was just  playing with larry no he was annoyed like you're not aware it's true it's like wait you're not aware  of this like everybody knows that jerry seinfeld's show wasn't canceled he's looking to see if he's on 
[01:46:30]  cnn that maybe he went into the wrong studio larry king like wasn't really sure if uh he was  canceled or they had a huge build up to the final episode it was you know it was a success well like  i've told you since i know jerry yes you brutally honest yeah yeah so i don't think seinfeld could  lie he just he's it seems to me to be irritated with larry king and he's just addressing it he's like  a robot seinfeld i mean he's probably at home like a big submissive like he probably has all  these like you know warm and kinky things he likes but he's very very robotic in the sense that 
[01:47:00]  he just says whatever he wants to say without considering the fact that there's a cadaver  across from him who's not even talking speaking of puppets you're talking to one jerry don't you know  that it's like puppets lasted how long nine years 180 episodes you gave it up right i did they didn't  cancel you you cancel them you're not aware of this no i'm asking you do you think i got canceled 
[01:47:30]  are you under the impression that i got canceled i've hurt you jerry i thought that was pretty  well documented this is a show is this still cnn don't most shows go down a little most people do  also you but what did he say lost almost shows he goes doesn't it go down a little bit i guess he's  trying to talk about the like now he's trying to defend himself like yeah yeah down a little bit and  then jerry basically says most people most people meaning larry you've lost it a little bit  don't most shows go down a little most people do also you would but 
[01:48:00]  larry had no idea he had no idea how to react to it no he had no idea of what jerry said to him  yeah yeah i think i think uh larry king's a heart he used to be known as a really good listener in  interviews i don't think he listens anymore no jerry all jerry basically says you got alzheimer's  buddy and then larry just didn't really hear him listen again don't most shows go down a little  most people do also you would but what did he say i was the number one show on television larry 
[01:48:30]  do you know who i am jewish guy brooklyn yes okay 75 million viewers last episode what are you  most people know he's from long island too a lot of great comedians came from long island did yes  jewish guy brooklyn yes okay 75 million viewers last episode what are you don't take it so bad 
[01:49:00]  well that's a big difference between being canceled and being number one okay i'm sorry  oh that does say it all certainly is a big difference because stupid larry is like don't  take it so seriously it's like well no you should why would you want people to think that he got  canceled don't take it so bad well that's a big difference between being canceled and being number 
[01:49:30]  one okay i'm sorry it certainly is we'll be right back b movie open  can we get a resume in here for me  we'll be right back  that's great larry didn't do his homework nope he doesn't how do you not do your homework on  seinfeld like you should know enough just about popular culture to know enough to talk to jerry  seinfeld about anything without even a one sheet in front of you you know i mean that that is a guy 
[01:50:00]  who is so far out of touch i'm sorry to interrupt you can i say i just thought i saw i swear to god  i thought this was an ad for b movie it's a nasinex commercial yeah yeah nasinex so you do the nasinex  commercials i like that stuff along with garlic i keep that in welch's grape juice next to my bed  was seinfeld the show that had the neighbor that hates the  was was was that the one he was at a uh a comedy show and he would just say 
[01:50:30]  over and over again is that your neighbor do you like jerry  are there any bees in your movie i know bumblebees are a black and yellow  uh but are there any just pure uh black ones  yeah the neighbor came sliding in yelling didn't he all the time i watched the show 
[01:51:00]  you had neighbors uh what were their names fred and ethel right  he never watched the show you got canceled didn't you you made you left mash to go on to hello larry  and it was a just a tremendous bomb wait you're who so jerry steinfeld 
[01:51:30]  they used to call him that they talked to people years ago before he was like really known  and they'd be like you see that steinfeld show you mean steinfeld  hey uh we got a great here's larry king uh more stupidity from him  the internet as a political medium viable  what  oh how do you not how do you not know at this point the internet is pretty viable it's like 
[01:52:00]  the only yeah it's about everything oh my god is he that as a political medium viable  yeah it's like the only one left absolutely and that's what that's not just me saying it that's  everybody's saying there's 80 billion things on it yeah but if you know 80 billion things on it  and you know none of them what do you what do you what button do you push to even get there i don't  know i i was trying to get on that internet's with my typewriter and i couldn't get on and then i ran 
[01:52:30]  out of paper  everybody's saying there's 80 billion things on it yeah but if you know where to look  you know it all it all can come together when you're looking for the particular information  that you're looking for after you do the big search this is what i found out by going on there  it just takes your mind and then you live in there forever you can never come out  never gone searching oh my god it just opens up this is what amazes me he's been in broadcasting

[02:15:30]  then let's get the show on the road  on the road  let me get some volume  or they yell at me  there we go  enjoy  uh  hi  welcome  so what's going on  with the merger  where's logan  i'm in murders and executions  oh  mergers and acquisitions  come on  love that movie  yeah i would love to get  elo on the phone  and ask what uh  the merger  they said they think  the department of justice  may uh  approve it  well  the doj  as they say jimmy 
[02:16:00]  the doj  well my friends  in the department of justice  have informed me  that it may happen  yes  like the main guy  saying uh  he wants to approve  the merger  but the rest of the doj  says they don't want to  but uh  the main guy  is pretty much  gonna say  f you  i approve of this  and then supposedly  the fcc  follows suit  uh  they do what the doj  says  really  so this thing  might be wrapped up  sooner than later  so where is  elo  we don't call it the doj  we call it the dodge  the dodge 
[02:16:30]  the dodge  yeah they all know  what we're talking about  well what about  the f  b  i  i give you  no logan is the dodge  he dodges our phone calls  of course  yeah  all right  the doj  are we trying to get  logan on  yes  all right  um  yeah  because that uh  what it could be uh  any day now that they  announce something  but then how long does it  take  like you can't just say  okay we're a company  we're one company 
[02:17:00]  and then it like  just all of a sudden  starts working  as one company  it's gonna be a few days  at least before  everything's together  perhaps more than that  how do we not  we have to introduce  poe over on the  3fm side  so they get to know him  as an interview subject  why exactly  bother  they don't know him  we're doing povember  we have to let them know  master poe  already days into povember  i know  they don't know him  we uh  one gives a flying poe  they think he's just  a parody of a boob  they don't realize 
[02:17:30]  he's a real guy  they're like  who is this  this this horse  parody of a boob  who is this  horse's patoot  they speak of  to quote colonel potter  horse's patoot  horse hockey  horse hockey radar  i love mash  you know what we  god the jokes  don't hold up  no  oh god i was  watching a whole uh  marathon  on mash  and you're like  uh  i kind of remember  enjoying this a little  more  i love the acting  and i love the  serious moments  yeah  but that back and  forth banter  that's just two 
[02:18:00]  marx brothers  yeah  and yeah  it  the jokes don't  hold up  they're really corny  and  horse hockey  unrealistic  what  horse hockey  horse hockey  um  no we gotta get  poe in here  because we had  slash on the  uh  the old radio show  slash  and uh  poe felt  a bit  oh take your  time poe  poe  you know  poe 
[02:18:30]  it might be  different  it might be  different in the  martial arts world  but radio you gotta  get right in  i saunter  right to it  it's my job  is to saunter  so poe  uh  we had slash  in the great  slash  from one of the  greatest rock  bands  uh  i'm  uh  tough to say  of all time  but certainly  one of the  greatest ever  slash  snake pit  i would say  is that the  one  yes  guns and roses  is way up  there as far  as bands go  for many many  people out there  and obviously 
[02:19:00]  you had no idea  who he was  right  no  good for you  i kind of like  that actually  probably no idea  and you felt like  he was disrespecting  you because he  didn't go through  the the uh  the poe uh  obstacle course  to get into  the studio  well the last  time someone  came into the  studio anthony  did not appreciate  that so  who was that  um  what was that  what color  was it  it was one  of the  what was the  comedian that  was here the  uh  a couple of  weeks ago  i forgot his  name  yeah we barely  ever have  comics 
[02:19:30]  patrice no  older gentleman  older gentleman  oh pat cooper  thank you  oh  what happened  with pat cooper  i'm trying to  remember  he was already  here when we  came in  i didn't mind  that  oh right  right  well he's a  big you know  he's a big  star  uh  no the only  thing i didn't  like the  certain people  are fine  other people  especially sitting  here at the  console  see that's what  i should say  okay if a guest  comes in and  doesn't want to  hang out in any  area because they  can't really and 
[02:20:00]  they want to sit  on the couch over  there that's fine  pat cooper coming  in sitting right  there next to  the seat that i  have to sit in  was the second i  saw it i went  okay i'm not  getting any break  between shows and  i gotta set shit  up and i know  he's just gonna  how you doing  anthony what  california for  california did i  ever tell you  about my dad's  farts you know  he would go into  the bathroom and  not a scent would  come out right he  was a man's man  my mouth my mouth  to god the man 
[02:20:30]  would flush eight  times eight times  and then once it  but once i come  home plate he  smacked me in the  mouth and i'm  sitting there like  shit pat what are  you talking about  pat first of all  you're just babbling  you're a crazy  person yes and i  have shit to do and  i want to breathe  before i gotta talk  for another couple  hours down a little  bit i hope people  understand the beauty  of the pat cooper  bit that we  acknowledged after he  was here that he  was telling everyone  how great his dad  was because he  would flush eight  times courtesy  flushes so none of  the family would  smell his uh his 
[02:21:00]  uh shit but then  uh fast forward a  day or two he's  beating the shit  out of pat cooper to  the point where pat  cooper has to call  the cops and uh  and he never saw  his father again  after the age of  14 years old and  the way he but he  would go back and  forth to how great  the man was to he  beat the shit out of  me but the way he  describes the beating  the shit out of is  kind of the yelling  over the top hat right  like but then he gets  all sentimental and his  voice gets low and he  goes that man never 
[02:21:30]  left an odor when he  was in the bedroom not  innocent he was a  gentleman and he  beat the crap out of  me but like what  the hell I had to  call the cops I did  he's a mad person and  the fact is getting  back to it I knew  when him he with him  sitting there there  was gonna be a  problem I should have  stressed more that  that perhaps if they're  sitting over there  like slash was  fucking around with  a guitar hero he's  way over there in the  corner I could be here 
[02:22:00]  to go about my  business and not have  to worry about having  to carry on a  conversation slash walked  right by Poe right  well and then you  said something like I  don't know who this  spice is but good  fucking smoothie well  he came in and and  uh the entire entourage  just came into the  room and I went to I  came in here and I  told him I said is it  possible that you can  wait outside oh boy  um you don't tell  slash to wait outside  oh boy it's slash  well I did go to  Iraq Iraq knows more  about this Iraq you're  on go hey um when 
[02:22:30]  Iraq can help when we  came in uh Paul pulled  me aside and goes uh  look we had a problem  doing the voice Eric we  had a problem with a  previous guest um this  guy Spice Slice whatever  the fuck his name is  uh Spice I couldn't keep  him out of the studio he  just went in so I was  like it's okay it's  slash he's allowed to go  in there and uh and hang  out well Anthony didn't  like when other guests  were coming in it's okay  Poe and then uh a little 
[02:23:00]  bit later he sees the  the book and looks at  the back and he goes oh  so that's who he is ah  you don't know who  Slash is no I'm sorry  that's not the kind of  music that I listen to  but he'd know like  Slashito but he's he's  more than the music like  he's on TV a lot just for  being Slash you don't  even have to know his  shit I don't watch  television too much  Guns N' Roses I know  Guns N' Roses yes he's  the guitarist this guy with  the big hat now I know  that wait a minute you 
[02:23:30]  know Guns N' Roses but  you don't know Slash  with the big hat and the  hair and the guitar I  only know Guns N' Roses  from friends of mine that  listen to that type of  music what do you mean  by that type of music  rock you know what do  you like rock and roll  god I was so close  Poe's a crooner  I do I enjoy um I enjoy  salsa I enjoy uh R&B I  also enjoy oldies I'll  tell you everything that  Poe enjoys because it is  programmed into my uh radio  when I drive home  and I'm pushing going what

[02:25:00]  your shoulders so  basically anything that  sets off an epileptic fit  so like the the new  the new olympic logo or a  pokemon cartoon it's gonna  make you want to pull  your head to the left and  then have your shoulders  shake and fall down to  the ground and put a  wallet in your mouth  what are you talking  about this song is great  sends relatives screaming  for a spoon if it has  that beat you're able to  move is this part of the  salsa movement no this

[02:28:30]  body rock tape and tape DVD whatever the  fuck it is and it seems a lot of people  are around and and he's instructing them  on a body rock and now I also hear tell  through the grapevine there Poe that you  feel he has ripped you off well I think  that his dances are very similar to mine  yeah yes well how about this when's the  next live event we have we're doing  something with eggnog am I correct 
[02:29:00]  yeah we're drinking it we know we're  doing we got to do that in early  December right after Thanksgiving we  kick off the the old Christmas holiday  with the eggnog drinking contest and  homeless shopping I would be  interested I don't know if Poe would do  it but I would be interested at a live  event and seeing a long one but some  kind of an example of body rock because  we hear about all the time we don't  see it yeah demonstration maybe with a  couple of participants but they come  up and you can instruct them on the 
[02:29:30]  moves what's your favorite body rock  song I enjoy the the one by Justin  Timberlake that's a fantastic song  because it's slow well it starts you  off you can't teach beginners fast music  is body rock just dancing and stuff huh  is it just dancing body rock yes it's  dancing but I also mix martial arts and  boxing you'll be like you'll be like  throwing punches and turning your hips  and stuff like that and and little  kicks is like Tybo almost it's like 
[02:30:00]  there is a typo typo gentlemen it's  typo whatever I can add into body rock I  will from knee ups to the front kicks to  side kicks punching bobbing weaving  slipping and shoulder shoulder like  kicking ass with no one in front of you  pretty much okay so you do martial arts  dancing and spinning yes the whole the  whole kit and caboodle if I may yes and  and me not people that that are are  behind me they sweat and they love it 
[02:30:30]  you would add anything to body rock  true what about consent  I'm plying  I'm just fucking with a man yes I know  I'm smiling  all right  rape allegations this time  for a demonstration on you  yeah I would like to see body rock because we hear about it and I know it's I want to see like an all-out body rock  demonstration what's your uh you need a fast one all right um there are quite a few songs from 112 from uh b2k b2k would be perfect because that's fast and I have I have I have um there are our fans of the show that have also come to my came to my school and and they've they've joined the body rock classes uh I'd say about four or five of them can I I'm sorry to interrupt you 
[02:31:00]  I have a flyer it says master poe and it has a like a black silhouette of a kicking man martial arts and fitness centers and it says complete martial arts training this is the body rock ad for men women and children master poe offers uh something to fit your 
[02:31:30]  oh somebody edited this  it's very funny it's supposed to be a video or something but it says master poe offer aid offers aids  they they they fucking grayed out some of the words  all right so master poe is offering aids  oh it answers  to fit your needs including his famous 
[02:32:00]  body rock  and cardio kickboxing  famous may be a stretch  well known probably better  and then it has a picture here of poe with a bunch of chicks behind him  which is usually just the opposite  it's usually he is stalking them  uh  oh my god  they're dancing and then there's a cardio kickboxing to go with gloves on  so basically this is just exercising with the martial arts  um and dancing  to music yes  okay get ready to burn  all right cool but this is a flyer  yeah when are you starting the classes there poe 
[02:32:30]  uh as soon as my new school opens up  and that get ready to burn  that get ready to burn is is uh my phrase that I I yell out to all the students and they scream it out  oh I I yell out burn  unfortunately  unfortunately he was taking a little too literally last time with the whole uh place  why don't we get  why don't we get  wow  that's what I heard  wow  Anthony doesn't fucking around does he  no he doesn't  nah  cool me it goes right for it  I'm just  give me that razor  are you gonna

[02:45:00]  that's big at weddings now  yeah I don't see  I mean I see what you're trying to do  but I don't see people being motivated  for any length of time  unless you like  you gotta boost them up  where the motivation comes from  is the music is blasting  and you feel  and you'll hear that beat  it's blasting  and then you have about 60 people  behind you  and everyone is sweating  do they need like a step or something  no  do it on the floor  when was the last time  you actually body rocked  this past weekend  but where are you 
[02:45:30]  teaching classes  if you don't have your studio  I teach at my house  how many people  were in your house body rocking  one  a lovely young lady  and how many were allowed to leave  no no  by my house  there's a place  that I teach  I'm teaching privately  until my new school comes up  how many people  did you have body rocking  about six  in a living room  or something like  no  like a basement  small studio  watch the credenza  right  were you yelling  were you yelling at them

[02:49:00]  today  what were you gonna say  because it's povember  and we're trying to learn  a little more about  our own master poe  he's been here for as long  as we have  and I don't think  our audience really knows  a lot about you  based on our show  and master poe I think  has adjusted very well  when he first came in  it was a little weird  to have guys teasing him  oh there's no sense of humor  poe at first  poe's fucking alpha male  his whole way of dealing  with people is if they say no  he kicks them in the gums  and so he's adjusted  and become quite a good egg  and doesn't mind a good teasing 
[02:49:30]  I like that  well I think he minds it  well whatever  he doesn't react  it's more acceptable now  he probably would like  to fish hook all of us  with his fingers  see this poe's in  in like kind of the arena  of you know  the radio people  and the comedians here  so he's kind of got to  play by the rules  but out in the street  he would be a fucking  an awful  like you try to tease him  outside of work  hey poe  he just fucking sticks  his fucking fingernail  fingers under your nose  master poe's body bag  he's got a couple of nails  on that would just  scratch the shit  that's why he leaves him  so he can fucking hurt

[03:02:00]  absolutely  Master Poe's website  P-O-S  stands for  piece of shit  what  yeah  masterpieceofshit.com  why don't you like  Master Poe  Poe-vember  shut up  just a  it's just a  alright  bottom floor  Bob  doesn't like your website  Bob  probably wants porno  Bob  alright  thank you sir  are you with me  yes  you're with me  no we're again ya  the Master Poe's P-O-S 
[03:02:30]  yes  it does stand  for piece of shit  isn't that like  kind of short  for piece of shit  seriously  reference the  uh  the Will Smith movie  about the aliens  he says  all this technology  at our fingertips  and I gotta ride around  and afford P-O-S  hmm  there you go  alright thank you  but it's easy to remember  Florida Steve  from Washington D.C.  you figure that one out  he writes  two Poe's  one cup  gentlemen  yeah the website  needs a lot of work  does it  what's on there 
[03:03:00]  what's on there right now  oh right now  I have pictures  I um  of you and your gi  no no my students  I have uh  students that um  are they hot  well they're students  so  oh boy  you should have hot chicks  on there  unethical  to think of them as hot  if you look at the website  whatever you decide is hot  oh I see what you're saying  you're not allowed to say  if they're hot or not  alright let's take a look  well Mars is one of Poe's students  yes  is he still your student  yes and he's still on there  is he  yes  is he good  uh very good  does he do body rock  no 
[03:03:30]  why  uh he doesn't like  to dance  he thinks it's for queers  alright  let's ask Mars  not everyone uh  dances  it's fine  mmhmm  but one of the students  that has come in here  uh  Mandalay  Mars  he's a big guy  yes sir  he does body rock  why don't you do body rock  you do a lot of things with Poe  it's very gay  oh  it's what  it's very gay  no no Poe  it's salty the boss  you my man  but uh  body rock 
[03:04:00]  we won't do  he tried though  he tried to get you  to do some body rock  uh  yes  and what'd you say  it's gay  uh  it's a good workout  but it's just  yeah it's just  is it gay if you're in a gi  well they don't wear gis  they wear shorts  and leotards  and things like that  leotards  tank tops  what do you wear  you're in your gi  when you're doing the body rock  yes all the time  because I have to turn  and split  and do all the moves  well Mars  would you get to see  chicks in skimpy outfits  though that might be a plus right  with all due respect Poe 
[03:04:30]  a lot of you women in the class  don't look that good  oh  oh  damn  if they were fine  I would be in the class  what seems to be the problem  he's got a lot of chunkies in there  well that's why they would take a class  like body rock  yeah but they're taking a class forever  and staying chunky  he's saying basically  fatty in fatty out  I can't help  whatever they eat after class  that's not my problem 
[03:05:00]  as long as they're with me  and I tell them exactly what to do  while they're there  I train them  they burn  they sweat  they lose calories  when they go home  if they want to have McDonald's  that's entirely  but it shouldn't be called chunky rock  yeah  building rock  right  was that a saying  that the body rock  is not effective  or that the girls  just their eating habits  are shit  I think the program's effective  I just think the women  that go there  are these  you know  they had two  three kids  Jersey housewives 
[03:05:30]  they need a lot of help  with low self-esteem  yeah  gotcha  so Mars  not a ring endorsement  for body rock  but not a condemnation  doesn't sound like it  it's just not for him  this is one of your top guys  like trashing your whole  like livelihood  not really  honestly  I'm sorry  I stepped all over you again  that's okay man  no we don't  Mars wasn't trashing  he was basically just saying  that it's for fat chicks and faggots  that's what Mars was saying  that's not trashing it  that's basically just saying  yeah there's gay guys 
[03:06:00]  and fat housewives from Jersey  that's it  that's his clientele  he's got quite a  there's a few  that you know  showed up  and for some reason  after they were there  I mean they were  good looking girls  Mars can't even look at me  with what he's about to say  but I've seen some  pretty hot ones  go for the first class  second class  and then disappear  literally  literally  from the face of the earth  they just find a fucking  two of her 
[03:06:30]  her hairs  and a shoe  and a skew shoe  a busted fingernail  and a well  what would happen to them  for some reason  they don't come to class anymore  I don't know  why  for my next move  it's called  the shallow grave  how come they don't come back  the class is not easy  it's a difficult class  and I can guarantee  no one here  can finish  one of my classes  I have a bad ankle  I can't  guaranteed  wow really  that's right  no one  not even Nathaniel  Nathan's in good shape 
[03:07:00]  let him do it  oh shit  that's a challenge  oh shit  no you didn't  Nathan what do you think  the challenge  has been brought in  are you willing to do  like gay exercises  with fat housewives  from Jersey  sure  that's Mars  I'm just repeating  what I heard  Mars can't even look  at Master Paul  so  yeah I mean  I've been looking  for a way to try  to do that  on my weekends  so  this is perfect  alright so  there's been a few  hot girls  they didn't come back  yes 
[03:07:30]  ok  the fatties  can't stop  the fatties  love it  they love it  I love you man  the fatties  love the attention  yeah  and the fine ones  have to get  too much attention  ah ok  so  it seems like  maybe  instead of  giving everybody  the same amount  of attention  and care  during this  that some people  might be a little  more privileged  than others  well it's amazing 
[03:08:00]  how you're able  to make that  deduction  when you're not  in the class  number one  you're behind  the glass door  outside stretching  and you don't  come into the class  and personally  I don't think  you can handle  the class anyway  oh  oh  Lincoln Center  we are going to  have Body Rock  in the Lincoln Center  so you should be there  I think we need  a student versus  teacher  exercise thing  right now  that was an  interesting point  what are we doing  are we doing  how about we do  a plank standoff  to the death  that was 
[03:08:30]  hummina hummina  hummina  no no no  wait a minute  wait a minute  yeah  let's go  Marge what's your  response to  you're directing it  directly towards me  so um  I must tell you  that the classes  that I do attend  now  um  smoke your class  wow  wow this is  uh  now it's getting  like  this is the  end of the  real  you came direct  so  you came direct  though Paul  you're right  you did come direct  with a big insult 
[03:09:00]  so he had to come  back with a figure  it had nothing to do  with the classes  that you're taking  now  because unfortunately  I don't have my  school anymore  at this moment  I'm teaching privately  way to hit him  when he's down  well I'm not sure  what you mean  that's okay  I can't believe  Mars would hit him  while he's down  now I'm with you  Mars is a student  for how long  was your student  proposed for  I was a post student  for about 5-6 years  5-6 years  and you said  the class you take  now  I'm just a little bit  I'll catch you  on the speed  you go to other  classes now  absolutely yes  okay  and what kind of class  I go to the judo 
[03:09:30]  jiu-jitsu class  and the class  that's run there  is high speed  very manly  every individual  that goes there  is a pretty big guy  everybody is flexible  wow  it's a tough class  sexy  it's a sexy class  Po  and your fighting skills  have they improved  since you've been  with me  oh absolutely  I never  I never deny that  there's no denying that  he's just talking  about your exercise  exercise classes 
[03:10:00]  body rock  body rock  well were you  I don't know  I have no idea  what are you referring to  oh the exercises  that's what you were  talking about  me taking your  body rock class  oh you're not talking  about the martial arts  aspect of it  no no  the actual  you know  sweating  smoking  the class that I take now  we warm up  for about  half an hour  and we're  totally drenched  and then we fight  we take  a lesson or two  and we actually  fight every night  you weren't fighting 
[03:10:30]  every night  we were fighting  we were fighting  every night  we were fighting  once a week  and it's a little  different  the striking portion  of it is excellent  but the grappling  portion is a little  different also  because you know  of course  the expertise  that Sensei has  who's Sensei?  Sensei Carvello  and a lot of guys  that go there  are cops  wait is Sensei Carvello  a better grappler?  grappling?  yes  you're saying 
[03:11:00]  the striking  and the grappling  I don't know  what you're talking  there's a difference  between what his teacher does  he's a friend of mine  Carvello  he does jiu jitsu  he says it all different  why do you say  it's a yard of throwing?  Carvello  right  Carvello  you're coming in  you're throwing someone  I teach  how to trap  how to lock  take down  punch  kick  elbow  headbutt  shin  more for the street  hoping to open my school  up on Rape Island  in the Bahamas  that's right  with the magician  where one of my exercises  is laps around a car 
[03:11:30]  try to make it  to the plane  so what's  what's this little  sounds like a little  weird thing  between Paul and Marjorie  yeah we need  not a hatred  just an odd moment  we need a plank off  to the death  yeah  something going on  what exercise  a little endurance exercise  can you two do right now  student versus teacher  in an all out  cage match  fucking lightsabers dude  classic battle  fucking lightsabers  wish they had them  wait  can we find out  what the strife is first  I want to know 
[03:12:00]  what's going on  there's a vibe here  which I never picked up on  well Paul and I  we were very close  uh oh  there's a word in there  word  word  I heard word  pardon the squeaky mic  I'm just moving  get out of the way  I'm moving over here  they can  Mars can't even look at them  you should be in there  before we move on here  E-Rock you okay  you haven't moved  since your fucking  ab exercise  I knew this was going to happen  time to go back to work Eric  oh boy  there's been a few incidents  Paul that he kind of  let me down 
[03:12:30]  how  how  it's Povember  I think we should get  these things out  yeah let's get this out  I had a little issue  last Halloween  when  he introduced me  to someone  and  he said  she was his girlfriend  and  after an incident  at the Halloween party  all of a sudden  she wasn't his girlfriend  anymore  called the plaintiff  went from girlfriend 
[03:13:00]  to plaintiff  in my face  you're telling me  just your friend  and I was like  wait a minute  the same girl  that comes over  to the Jewish center  where we used to train  she was like yes  and I'm like  kept asking you  these questions  like trying to let you know  that I know  the girl's the same woman  why are you  telling me in my face  it's not the same woman  so that kind of bothers me  oh  wait I'm lost Jimmy  I'm a little lost  just a little  something happened  with these guys  where  Paul  I honestly have no idea 
[03:13:30]  I think the incident  was dropped on air though  so that's why  I'm kind of  being  not so  descriptive  I have no idea  we brought it up  last Halloween  hmm  why did we drop it  because it was getting  a little too  it was at the Halloween party  that we had  oh because you guys  almost fought last year  it was at the Halloween party  that we had down at  the Hard Rock  yes  and you were seeing a girl  no no no  no no  you wanted to see a girl  but Paul  no no  no  Paul was seeing a girl 
[03:14:00]  Paul was seeing a girl  right  Paul were you seeing this girl  at the time yes  okay  alright  we got that much  Paul was seeing a girl  Halloween party  that was a Halloween party  and then I met her  as his girlfriend  then come Monday  after she did  quite a few things  at the Halloween party  that you know  he's not very proud of  what did she do  at the Halloween party  I don't even know  who the girl is  we all know  we all know who she is  Flash or something  like  no  some acts  that Paul didn't appreciate  and I'm with you on that 
[03:14:30]  Paul can we  can you tell us  sort of or no  I don't wanna  what girl are you talking  is it  is it a girl  that no longer  lives around here  correct  was it a fucking year ago  she was here  yeah she was gone  but I had no idea  he was gonna bring that up  we were on martial arts  all of a sudden  now we're on a girl  okay  is there  what did she do  at the party though  I know the girl  he meets now  was there a tie in  with um  yes  okay  alright  a tie in with what  we know the girl 
[03:15:00]  but I actually  didn't realize  that was a fucking  year ago  I thought she was here  fucking six months ago  alright  remember up  do you remember now  thumbs up  do you remember the time  alright  so Paul was seeing somebody  she did some things  he didn't like  what were things  flashing things like that  where you don't wanna  talk about it  if it's any consolation  I've admitted that I  fucked a tranny  without a bag  nothing you say  is gonna be any worse  I've been shit on Poe  unfortunately that  doesn't even work anymore  because no one's  surprised at what you say  no no but I'm saying 
[03:15:30]  that like  as people  we all are  exploring a certain level  but I thought that was a bit  yeah  no no I handed her  a few hundred in cash  but you know  we've all had these  embarrassing  fucking moments  it's nice to say  we don't have to get  way into it  but you were  you took this girl  to our Halloween party  she did some things  at the party  that made you  very uncomfortable  why is Mars in this  well  you know  we occasionally  come in  come into work together  and in a car  man to man  you're looking at me 
[03:16:00]  in my face  and you're telling me  that she was never  your girl  and you know  they kind of like  disturb me  because I'm not  that stupid  you know  or I mean  maybe that early  in the morning  I made a mistake  and maybe I said  the wrong thing  but wait  I'm so confused  little  wait  I think  wait Mars  but why would  that concern you  maybe he was  just embarrassed  and didn't want  to admit  that he ever  like  was  that she was  his girlfriend  am I missing something  wait hold on  Mars  you can see it 
[03:16:30]  Mars was just  saying to Paul  you don't believe  his explanation  because Paul said  maybe he made  an error of some sort  right  and I kept asking  and reassuring myself  that we're talking  about the same person  and I'm not making  a mistake  and you know  in my face  he kept lying to me  well maybe something  happened that  something transpired  that weekend  and it just stopped  the relationship  altogether  I understand that man  but  okay  so if I was to say that  go ahead  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  no  I'm just trying to make 
[03:17:00]  sure people understand  so as good friends  you were mad at Paul  because he lied to your face  by saying this isn't  his girlfriend  yeah I don't care  about what he does  I don't give a shit  it's just that  I'm not that stupid  you know  and I'm asking you  is it the same female  that was in Jewish  center  yes  it was the same  girl that you sent  yes yes  I'm like  come on man  that's like a little  disrespectful  so there we detached  a little bit  from that point on  okay but that was  taken care of  that was all washed  underneath the bridge  that was all over  we were on a martial arts  subject  actually it was  martial arts and fitness  actually to get back 
[03:17:30]  to the point  Jim was asking  about there was  a little strife  okay so he picked up  on it so I'm not  going to lie to my  man on the air  about this man  it might be a little  something there  so talking about it  what I picked up  is that you went  to my friend  Sensei  Sensei Calvajo  who is an incredible  judoka  and an amazing  jujitsu instructor  when my school  closed down  and I had no problem  with that  that's what I picked up  and you know  for you to train  under him  and continue  your training  that's wonderful 
[03:18:00]  that's great  well I also  trained with both  of you guys  at the same time  okay  right  for a very long time  yes you did  and what stopped  that was  no place  to train anymore  I know  every once in a while  you get into  a few experiences  in life  that just pushes  you back  a couple of steps  so yeah  so business  being business  you know  that's your business  so I'll take my business  somewhere else  that's all  I mean it was  I mean I hope  you're not getting  like offended by this  but 
[03:18:30]  I don't get offended  so then I just went  to somewhere where  you know we have bags  there's formal  you know classes  there's a lot of  guys  a lot of people  to work with  as opposed to  two or three  you know  that is  you're absolutely correct  nowadays you have to  have a facility  you need to have a dwelling  you need to have  some type of  roof over your head  roof over your head  and walls  and something that  you could look at  whereas I trained  in the street  I trained in the back alley  I trained in the basement  I trained wherever I could 
[03:19:00]  clubber lang  wherever I had to train  I trained  and it doesn't matter  where you go  as long as the instructor  gives you what you need  okay  that's  okay  it's fine  I can't argue  I mean  I could definitely argue that  but that's your opinion  and you're  you're gonna have a show  right  November 17th  right  you can talk about that  there  the arena  other people  where if you're gonna  do striking  you're gonna need  something to strike  right  you're gonna need a bag  you're gonna need  something to hit  if they're not hanging up there  you can't hit your opponent 
[03:19:30]  as hard as you want  because you know  we're training partners  so you need something  that's inanimate  to punch  kick  we'll send you rock  over there  not necessarily true  because if you  if you are familiar  with the Philippine Watts  which you are  you can use your knees  you could use your elbows  you can use parts of your body  to  take the place  of that bag  now you're not necessarily  hitting your hand  or your knee  as hard as you can  as hitting the  the bag  and the bag is not 
[03:20:00]  making that loud sound  that everyone needs to hear  but  you can hit your elbow  you can hit your knee  and if need be  you could hit a wall  yeah that's true  but we  or a tree  hey  I stick to a bag  a bag  works for  I mean  we've had  boxes  okay  from day one  there's one  training  paraphernalia  there  it's the bag  for example  it's always there  so maybe I wanted 
[03:20:30]  to go somewhere  where there was a bag  right  I did that  I had no problem  with that  that's fine  are you bothered  that Mars left you  I mean  are you guys  ex-lovers  you need water Mars  no I'm good  no I just  who has a crush  on who here  I'm confused  is he bothered  that you left  do you feel  he's bothered  that you left  oh no  not at all  he's definitely  bothered that I came  in here  and brought up  that subject  about the girl  I'm extremely  interested  and I don't  know why  because I don't  really understand  what the problem  is here  what is the real  issue  like he  I have no issue 
[03:21:00]  you used to train  under Poe  you had to move  on because he  didn't have  the right  equipment  he didn't have  his facility  so you had  to do your  thing  you want to  actually punch  like bags  and stuff  instead of  trees  that don't  move  so you  kind of  don't want  to break  your fist  and stuff  while you're  training  right  I'm a dummy  that sounds  reasonable to me  but Poe  saying you could  still train  even if you  don't have  things to  hit  well you  do have  air shields  and you  have hand  pads  alright  so you  leave his  class now  he's taking  it hard  that you  left him  no no  we've been  we've been  fine 
[03:21:30]  no it's  just me  coming in  here and  bringing up  the issue  about  the other  thing  oh because  I asked  what the  stripe  I sense  there's a  weird stripe  between you  guys  and I only  know you  guys  and the  only  and that  is  all that  is about  is that  him  Poe  as your  friend  lied  to your  face  about  who  this  girl  was  as far  as a  girlfriend  or acquaintance  or what  have you  but I  could see  Poe's  point of  view  where  maybe  he really  liked  this girl  and then  he was  embarrassed  by her  so he  just  didn't  really  want to  admit  that  to  someone  he didn't  want to  really show  weakness  to you  Mars  his friend  something else 
[03:22:00]  is going  on between  you guys  you're mad  that he lied  to you  about something  pretty simple  yeah and  just  continuously  lied to me  I mean  I asked  him over  do you  understand  that he was  probably  embarrassed  it sounds  like she  embarrassed  him  at an  O&A  function  I'm pretty  sure  but there's  been more  embarrassing  moments  but all  you wanted  him to say  like yeah  she was  my girl  I liked  her but  I'm moving  on  that particular  day  you know  I mean  because I 
[03:22:30]  kept asking  over and over  the same  I mean  like about  four or five  different types  of ways  of asking  the question  and sure  enough  every time  was in my  face  nope  nope  nope  and that  kind of  bothered me  you know  I thought  we had  a little  more bond  but you know  when you're  speaking man  to man  and or  teacher to  student  whichever way  you want to  go  and you go  to that  person  and you  apologize  to them  and then  it's completely  over and  done with  straight up  no you're  right  then we take  it back  if you want 
[03:23:00]  to go back  to the street  that's it  it's over  it's over  it's it's  this way  that's just  common practice  what do you  mean  when you  apologize  to someone  it's over  you don't  you don't  continue on  that chain  of attack  we're doing  we're doing  Paul Vember  so they're  asking you  about stuff  right  we're getting  away from the  spirit of  Paul Vember  here  who apologized  I was lost  to me  when you go  to someone  and apologize  what happened  well I  apologized to  Masolino  for what I  said to him  and you know 
[03:23:30]  it was a  very hard  situation  and I  didn't  are you guys  friends  I wasn't proud  yeah we're  great friends  we're brothers  he's mad at me  now he would  love to kick  my motherfucking  ass  but it's  Povember  you have to  wait till  Mars  before it's  your month  what did you  apologize for  like what did  you say to him  and roughly  not exactly  a paraphrase  I apologized  for telling him  that she was  not my girl  and in the  beginning she  was not  and then  eventually she  was and then  what happened 
[03:24:00]  that weekend  was very  bad  why did you  not tell him  that day in  the car  again I was  embarrassed  she even  did something  that pissed  me off  that you  don't even  know about  right  there was  a bunch  of strippers  that we  had  and sweetheart  you know  I like  to look  oh you  don't  you're  apologizing  to your  woman  that's  listening  to the  show  perhaps  so here's  a bunch  of  there was  like five  or six 
[03:24:30]  good looking  strippers  and I  tapped you  in the  show  and I  said  damn  look  at  that  and once  I went  like that  she  actually  took my  hand  and went  in between  us  and grabbed  you  I was  like yo  what's up  with that  there's a love  triangle here  something going  on  no no no  where she  was mad  that you  pointed out  the stripper  yeah  okay  where was  pat this  whole time  look at  the hand  pushes the 
[03:25:00]  mic away  sorry  just wondering  hey look  we're all  we're like a  family here  we really are  we're all  we're all  very involved  in each  other's  lives  we spend  hours a  day  together  we kind  of  we overlap  sometimes  and we get  to know  each other's  personally  embarrassing  stuff  yes  we all have  it  believe me  you're not  the only one  that's had  weird issues  with it  my girlfriend  hates it  I come in  and I blast her  on the air  constantly  are we gonna  have a plank  off to the  death  or what  it's  true  we can do  that  Poe's really  angry right now  yes he is  no I'm not  yes he is  Poe you are 
[03:25:30]  Poe what do you  need to do  to come down  do you feel  betrayed at  all Poe right  now  um no  you know  guys  when I first  started I was  a little hard  I was a little  you know  rough in regards  to this show  I didn't understand  it now I  understand it  it's about a  couple of guys  getting together  and having fun  and sometimes  you know when  you have your  own month  well  damn  oh that's  hilarious  he's ready 
[03:26:00]  to commit  he's ready  to commit  murder  on November  5th  it's about  the same  February  we only  have fucking  23 more  to go  all right  we're gonna  send this out  to Poe  and Mars  can I just  say  I want to  do the plank  off to the  death but  can I just  say one  one thing  yeah  go home  and get  your fucking  shine box  yeah  uh oh  turn down  the music  we're not  ready for  one  yeah we gotta  hear this  just pull out  something to  say  no you guys  are giving me  the opportunity  of a lifetime  and I really  appreciate 
[03:26:30]  the fact of  having my own  radio show  even if it's  for one night  at least it is  that's true  yeah  he's getting  a show  gonna be here  on 202  and talking  some martial arts  street fighting  prison fighting  yes  I have  Grandmaster  or I should  say  Flash  great  great  great  Grandmaster  Aaron Banks  everyone in  the world  knows  who he is  everyone in  the world 
[03:27:00]  I don't know  who he is  I don't know  Marcelino do you  know who he is  uh yes I do  know who uh  Aaron Banks is  I did study under  him for a little  bit  under him  you have Grandmaster  Lenches  Richard Lenches  when is uh  Mars gonna be  a sensei  yeah why does he  have to be the  student  why does he  always have to be  a student man  my young padawan  I want  I want to train  under Mars  is that how it  happens  then you're a  sensei  no man I'm  always a student  Opie wants to  be like little  Anakin  wait how do you 
[03:27:30]  become a sensei  that sounds cooler  than a student  you obtain I guess  black belt and a  few degrees in the  black belt and  then what happens  you gotta ask a  sensei  it takes time  and this is one of  the things that we're  going to discuss in  the arena because  there are people that  have black belts in  five months  really  that was me  Jimmy gave it back  though he's bored  yeah  I mastered the art  I moved on  yeah back to  swim walking  people think I'm  a grand master  but they get  confused with the  word wizard  yeah  it's  that's right 
[03:28:00]  he must be grand  yes  I don't know what  happened here but  are you guys okay  oh  we're fine  yes  yeah  you guys want to  hug  no  no hugging  what do you do  in the community  do you punch each  other real hard in the  face  how does this work  excuse me  what community  like the  karate  oh  kiriti  kiriti  kiriti  I thought he was  going to say the  latino community  or some shit like  that  no he didn't say  that  no I thought he  was  oh you're both 
[03:28:30]  latino right  yes  morico  hide the knives  that's why they're  both hotheads  hide the knives  latino men are  very uh  hot blunted  they say  tempers  hotheads  that's what they  call  how about a  cock off  a cock off  cock off  how about some  docking  how about some  docking  you're eight years  into your martial  arts training  yes sir  I want a little  like uh  like something here  like a plank off  or something  you guys don't hug  it's not a gay  thing to hug  men like  we hug  friends  we hug  differently  it's not 
[03:29:00]  you know  how do you hug  shoulder to shoulder  oh  I thought front to back  that's an awkward  hug for two men  that could be the  most awkward of hugs  because poe described  one where you take  both of your arms  and put them around  each other  and that's bad  then there's the one  where you're shaking  hands and then you  bump chest kind of  and give a pat on the  back  the shug  the shug thing  and I couldn't think  of it like I'm trying  to think  all right that's 
[03:29:30]  obviously two around  each other is pretty  gay but oh the  front to back man hug  could possibly be the  how about you guys  do a front to back  man hug  front to back  man hug  it depends on how  you do it though  oh yeah  yeah  like if you hug  somebody from the  back right  yeah  like if like  Sarah hugs  a guy from the  back and like  I loop my arms  under his  his arms are  straight and I  loop mine under  and I hold his  shoulders  and I hug him  from the back  yeah  is that fucked up  that  that is really  fucked up  yes  and can't I just 
[03:30:00]  buy my own like  black belt  I could  right  now you can  and I just  wear it  if you want  that would  prevent a lot  of fights  no  no  well  it  it doesn't  you know  who will  fight for  your honor  I wear Z-Rock  in  those little drums  that they hold  in their hand  are you a black  belt  no sir  no  what belt are you  right now in the  judo jiu-jitsu  system I'm blue belt  how far from black  are you  oh very far  wow  eight years  it takes no 
[03:30:30]  well I haven't  been doing jiu-jitsu  for eight years  ever quest  what do you guys  forever  three years  what do you gotta do  when do you level up  you gotta break a few  more boards  and you'll get there  nah see that's  that's the difference  with jiu-jitsu man  it's just  you fight  yeah  like  what do you got  in jiu-jitsu  there  Paul  well  I was  I was given a black belt  but again  there's sport  and there's combat  there's a difference  between the two  and that's what  we're gonna discuss  on the arena  do you think  that you're  a jiu-jitsu  black belt  arena  I don't know  I mean  you said I was given  a black belt 
[03:31:00]  does that mean like  I'm good at it  it's a honorary degree  or something  yeah I honestly  don't know what you  meant  you're a real  judo black belt  a jiu-jitsu  no no no  jiu-jitsu  yes  okay  okay look  with all due respect  right  it's unfair  to put Poe  in a situation  where you give him  you know  30 seconds  and he's gotta  submit somebody  right  okay  it's unfair  to Poe  because Poe  does  I just want  to ask  is it true  you obtain  the rank  of sensei  on Dagobah  training  under the  grand sensei  Pota  that's where 
[03:31:30]  it happened  I started  I started  training in  1967  how old are you  80  wow couldn't  I have picked  a funnier age  I really am  a fucking  you know  Jericho should have  just fucking  punched me  in my  no talented  throat  how old are you  230  Caroline's Friday  where's E-Rock  I want him  to demonstrate  the hug  I gotta piss  back to back  man hug 
[03:32:00]  the front to back  front to back  man hug  can you do  the front to back  man hug  can I hug you  this is not  to be a faggot  I'm a gay dude  I'll come  I'll hug you  so I'm  standing behind  Eric right  like a man  big shoulders  I'm behind E-Rock  and his hands  are down  a little stiff  and the front to back  hug  is when I  stand behind  him  and I  loop my arms  up under  my forearms  are touching  his breasts  and I grab  his shoulders  like that  and I go  like this  E-Rock 
[03:32:30]  is so  disgusted  and you give him  a snuggle hug  he leaned his head  on E-Rock's  back shoulder  Mars  Master Poe  what do you say  about what  that  about hugging  like that  but as  I was saying  and we all  know this  and respect  to Poe  that the show  is boring  no it's  unfair  it's unfair  to give him  30 seconds  for him to  submit 
[03:33:00]  like you know  people that  come in  especially  people that  are like  good in  wrestling  because Poe  is up  listen man  I'll walk  with you  anywhere  okay  this guy  is  lethal  okay  you're saying  that for  submission  it's hard  to ask him  to submit  but if it  came down  to a street  fight  where somebody  had to have  their fucking  eyes ripped out  exactly  exactly  Poe is the  man to be  with  but it's  unfair to  ask him  to do  something  that's  very sport  orientated  like submitting  a guy  especially  a biter  exactly  okay 
[03:33:30]  he'll put  his finger  in your ass  and pull  type of stuff  you know  would you do  that Poe  if you had  to  I've never  done that  one before  yeah  you probably  could have  picked a  better example  than that  homoerotic  dick  and he'll  gently tease  your asshole  until you  cum and  fall asleep  that was  very passive  aggressive  of Mars  he'll lick  your ball  bag  until you  cum  and you  can't  fight  anymore  he'll rub  your prostate  until you're  satisfied  I gotta piss  someone run to  the bathroom  I can't hold  anymore  you know  you guys  okay it's  Poe Vemba  man right  oh shit 
[03:34:00]  happy Poe Vemba  somehow  can someone get  me a Gatorade  bottle  this is gonna be  a long  someone ask  send me no  I need water  give me a Gatorade  bottle  how do I put  this in  just whatever  it is  tell me what  you told me  Sam the  troublemaker  wait what Sam  what do you got  what do you got  Mars recently  had complaints  about maybe  the time  a certain  staff member  was using  to prep  for their  upcoming  show  and the  resources 
[03:34:30]  they were  using  and he  thought that  they weren't  properly  allocated  especially  at those  specific  times  this is  on Mars  it's not  me  very diplomatic  wait what's up  Mars  thank you for the  water  is this about  Master Poe's  Saturday Night  Show  yes it is  why are you  drinking water  what's wrong  what's up  why are you  turning red  oh I love you man  oh my god he's  doing the E-Rock  wait so this  Saturday's Poe's  show  the 17th  yeah he's 
[03:35:00]  been prepping  for the last  three weeks  three  so what was  the issue  I'm not sure  what the issue  you can learn  something from  Poe  you know  something guys  I have been  watching you guys  for the last  three years  and I hope  I learned  just a little  bit  you're prepping  that's obvious  you haven't  or you just  show up and  wing it  and hope  the clips  are ready  what were you  saying  Mars  well  yeah he's  been prepping  for three 
[03:35:30]  weeks  um  gold  and um  well you know  what do you  mean by prepping  uh you know  doing his  interviews  making phone  calls  getting talent  ready  things of the  sort  you know  things like  that  and um  it's just  uh not done  after duty  what do you  mean not done  after much  oh boy  what's that  mean  that broke  some kind  of seance  what does  that mean  oh boy  you broke  some kind  of code  I did  yeah the  man code  but that's 
[03:36:00]  all right  yeah  what do you  mean  he's uh  prepping for  his saturday  night show  uh during  work hours  when he  should be  protecting us  uh oh  okay but if  we're just  and filling out  paper  that's um  how much water  do you think  we need  we're not  swimming  and  and the  swim walking  got the guy  thinking you  might need  water in  here jimmy  and the  resources we  were talking  about uh  called interns  oh  oh  okay wait  what does  sam know 
[03:36:30]  sam knows  something  pause your  defense too  i just  no i'm not  this is just  all stuff  mars is telling  me so i  don't know  what's happening  but oh  you're a  dirtbag  this is mars  i mean  me and mars  talk because  we're friends  too  and not  anymore  say it  straight sam  go ahead  i'm just  gonna give you  that finger  ass move  soon  he was  saying he  didn't know  why uh  he looked  around for  an intern  and they  were all  trying to  get uh  sound drops  from martial  arts movies  and also  he wanted  to know uh  why he 
[03:37:00]  was led  to believe  that the  door was  gonna answer  itself i  think is  what he  said to  me  it's  something  mars  said that  yeah  wondering if  the door  is gonna  answer  itself  why would  the door  answer  itself  because  poe  was  somewhere  else  when he  should  be  i mean  the bell  was ringing  oh  poe  defense  um  i could  have been  in the  bathroom  but no  i think  the time  that he's  talking  about  i was  in the  ron and  fez room  and trying  to listen  to uh  some of  the drops  and going 
[03:37:30]  back and  forth  what's 1130  you were  allowed to  do that  uh  no it was  early  you weren't  here  you were  at cbs  i suppose  you better  let him  in  there's  some top  secret  shit  going on  this is  a great  month  oh my  tony  left  his  email  what is  this  now  there's  paperwork  coming  in

[03:41:00]  all right here's  another clip um  it's a chuck  norris his views on  how martial arts have  evolved so are there  actual sound clips out  there that have chuck  norris talking about  his views on martial  arts i don't know  that's why i wanted to  find out again that  would be a lot of uh  a lot of work i  didn't realize how  much work is entailed  you know that's why we  try to do as little as  possible um  bruce lee his views on  combat and why he  developed jeet kundo  do you know that  those clips exist or 
[03:41:30]  you just want someone  to look around  well i know that  there's an interview  with um with bruce lee  back in the  mrs lee has it  60s um  wow that'd be really  hard to find  no it's out there  yeah  yeah  now macho man  camacho his chance  before or after he  fights someone what are  his chance  i i don't know i know  that he used to talk a  lot of garbage you know  before a fight  so you want some trash  talk from  macho camacho  uh some trash talk  from tyson  like he would come 
[03:42:00]  out and you know say  some shit  uh okay then we're  looking at  uh 300  before the battle of  glory reference  tonight we will dine in  hell and the speech  that leads up to  this is sparta  so you wanted that  clip where would you  where where in the  show do you think  you might pop that  in  um  well  the intro is  completed  and if you listen to  the intro you'll see  exactly what happened  i listened to danny  because danny told me  i'm doing i'm doing  too much work on it  i i was even going 
[03:42:30]  home and working at  home  oh that's crazy  i didn't realize how  much work is involved  and and my hat's off  to these guys  yeah  they do a lot of  work this is not  easy  how long is your show  gonna be  just one hour  so wait for a one hour  show you have guests  and four hours worth  of clips  well no the reason why  i wanted to hear these  clips because i wanted  to get a feel for the  clips the reason that  the show itself is is on  survival so if you take  the sport aspect and the  street aspect and and  and you figure out 
[03:43:00]  what's that the uh what  works and what doesn't  work what's real what's  not real um i wanted to  listen to the uh the  chants out there from  from these masters and  grandmasters and and  famous fighters just to  get a feel and see what  kind of intro i'll have  i'm looking at the um  the uh end the sound uh  bit with uh the scene  from braveheart and then  it's quoted not every man  dies but not every man  lives i think that might  be a misquote no he says 
[03:43:30]  that i think it's every  man dies but not every  man truly lives like  i mean yeah i think  that's it like you could  just live your life and  fucking you know you  might as well be dead  kind of a thing but i  don't think it's not  every man dies did we  go over what the  youtube videos are uh  no i would guess it's  just more what is it  uh there's 300 clips  i just 300 oh okay  okay yeah uh we're also  looking at mixed with the 
[03:44:00]  scene from 300 uh it is  an honor to die by your  side and his reply is it  was an honor to live by  yours okay download the  scene in troy before the  spartans crash to the  door and he yells to his  soldiers it's been an  honor to battle a lot of  honor going on on your  show yes a lot of honor  and again where would  these clips be played like  where would you i've never  done this before so i just  to have them available i  just want to listen to it  and and just get a feel  because i i have no idea  what these guys do i i've 
[03:44:30]  just i've watched them and  listen to their their  clips but i really don't  know what they do it's  just mean jim oh  he was a timing joke  i'm just kidding it was a  fucking vaudeville thing  i like this i like this  it has a lot of passion to  it the movie alamo uh  before the last battle  scene they may have said  something to prepare them  for battle  what fucking vagaries  paul just wants you guys  to go out and possibly  grab shit there might be 
[03:45:00]  a line about honor and  the godfather watch it  jesus paul anybody watch  family guy i want you to  watch every chuck norris  interview see if he says  anything on butt cake  he's got these vagaries  he's throwing these vagaries  i didn't know what i was  doing so i took these drops  yeah and i cut them as  much  why do you smile  wow  arcadian i've fought  countless times yet i've  never met an adversary who  could offer me what we

[03:47:00]  were my drops i pulled  from 300  about two weeks ago  poe asked me  he gave me a dvd  and he gave me a sheet  of uh some clips that  he won pulled from 300  so i was running back  and forth between the  run and fed's office  and  what time  oh uh  i don't probably  uh i would think  during the xm portion  of the show i was doing  it  i was doing feedback  oh no  wait a minute wait a minute  300 drops  so you were doing  300 drops while  the opian anthony show  was on the air on xm  correct yeah  every time i 
[03:47:30]  wait a second  every time i i went to  you i said are you  doing anything  i waited for someone  to say no  they're not  and when they told me  that i said is it  possible that you  could do this for me  and i and i i even  uh requested it from  danny and danny said  yeah no problem  you know you can have  one intern  as long as they're  not busy  okay  and poe by the way  sean from north carolina  very good observation  sean go ahead  uh yeah  poe said to grab  a clip from  the alamo  that he probably  gave him a pep talk  uh he does know 
[03:48:00]  all those motherfuckers  died right  oh shit  i might have been  all about the uh  the pep talk  those guys got  he doesn't know  those motherfuckers  died  oh that dude  that worked with  the accent so much  better than it would  have just  all right  good moving on  the movie gladiator  before the scene  when he's in the woods  and he tells the roman  soldier  the frost  sometimes the blade  sticks in the cold  or something like that  wait and poe  danny  so you need that clip  you wait  what were you saying 
[03:48:30]  about danny  so you could have  an intern right  danny had a rebel  if i told you  to take an intern  during this portion  of the show  it was just for  this specific reason  so that it could  actually be aired  that you asked  one of our interns  during the show  to do your  shitty show work  oh shit  well no  that was wild  the guys  were at cbs  that is only  when i  i was requesting  their time  all right  and then you got  a lot of troy clips  you need  and then the movie  fill in the blank 
[03:49:00]  where king arthur  before he was killed  is on his knees  and he speaks  to his people  and then yells out  defend the honor  of camelot  all right hold on  nathaniel i'm gonna go  need you to grab  them right now  irak get off the board  go grab some uh  300 anybody else  you might need  anything else  i forgot the name  of this movie  but i remember  that richard gear  was in it  holy shit  american gigolo  he's gonna pull out  the speech he gives  to lauren  before he fucks  up for money  let me tell you  of course you want 
[03:49:30]  braveheart  the freedom speech  that's a great one  yeah sure  where the gerbil  frees himself  from his asshole  you know the  internal affairs  where he's telling  andy garcia  he's gonna make  his wife teach her  how to cum  by fucking her  in the ass  i want that speech  can i get that  for my uh  martial arts show  shit  i need every word  spoken by swayze  in roadhouse  that's right  harrison ford  when he says  how dare you  mr president  that's true 
[03:50:00]  it's the melodramatic  clip show  clips that reek  of melodrama  and childlike emotion  oh you got  another witness  to be called  to the stand  yeah um  first of all  ronafez noon  to three  and of course  of course  he couldn't have  been doing it  at cbs  because he does  it all on my  computer  and i get here  at ten o'clock  so there's no way  he's doing it  while you guys  are at cbs  what's wrong  you didn't  listen to the 
[03:50:30]  show  oh  whoa  oh shit  when they were  at cbs  i was doing it  here  yeah but then  i get here  at ten  so everybody's  here  okay  i don't understand  it's before ten  well i get here  at ten  i'm here  he's saying that  he saw him  doing it  because he saw  matt pulling  300 clips  he gets here  at ten o'clock  so since he saw  matt pulling  the clips  it would have  had to be  while we were  on xm  that's what  pitts is saying 
[03:51:00]  by the way  someone's pointing  out after your  long intro  you're only  gonna have  45 minutes  to fill  i know  i want to  cut down  the intro  i know  more clips  how about  wax on  wax off  that's right  this is completely  new to me  i didn't know  i also want  the clips  of whitney  houston  from the  bodyguard  i mean  i understand  you don't  have a lot  of specific  knowledge about  radio production  and that's fine  we all had to  learn at some  point  but 
[03:51:30]  you do  understand  that to  ask somebody  to get  that clip  from that  movie i saw  once with  the guy  might be an  unreasonable demand  for anybody  it was  it was definitely  unreasonable  like rob roy  something in  that movie  that shows  courage  strength  and honor  i mean  that's  watched  the whole  movie  it's not  exactly  fast forward  to one hour  three minutes  and pull  clip  he explains  i believe  the scene  before rob  roy's wife  killed the king's  assistant  she has 
[03:52:00]  the scene  she has  some powerful  wording that  pertained to  strength and  honor  i'd like you  to watch  roots  there's a  moment of  jocularity  somewhere  on there  did you find  the moment of  jocularity  in roots  i don't know  if it's the  original or  the next  generation  so cancel  your weekend  plans  depending on  your point  of view  you either  have no  clips or  a lot  gentlemen  watch the  titanic  i believe  eventually  the boat  tries to  fight back  i want to  know what  it says  we are having 
[03:52:30]  a guest  from bow  dog  call in  a street  fighter  ready to  go in  for the  kill  or something  that has  real life  situation  that pertains  to beating  someone down  what's that  say that  one more  says a street  this is one  of your  bullet points  a street  fighter  ready to  go in  for the  kill  or something  that has  a real life  situation  that pertains  to beating  someone down  oh when  if you look  at youtube  and you type  in street  fight  there are  plenty of  people  or plenty  of scenes  where  you hear  the news  reporter  watch rob 
[03:53:00]  schneider's  the animal  find something  about glory  and honor  speaking of  glory  watch the  movie glory  i believe  there's  something  about  honor  when denzel  when that  teardrop  falls  i want  audio  of that  teardrop  going down  his cheek  to show  honor and  courage  under fire  mixture of  all the  are you digging  povember  i love you  mixture of all  the bubble  give me a  beginning to 
[03:53:30]  the show  it'll give  you a  beginning  middle  and end  yeah it's  too much  i know  name of the  show  what's the  name of the  show  the arena  master pose  arena  i like the  arena  why when we  walk up the  sidewalk everyone  says us  they come out  and say us  to you  they're martial  artists  the doorman  with the pot  bellies and a  martial artist  he's a black  belt  oh shit  which one's  that  a couple doors  down  uh yeah a couple  of doors  down  all right here  here is some  sound effects  that were  requested for 
[03:54:00]  the instant  replay  that's where  we  you know  the sound  machine  okay  poe needs  access to  the sound  machine  the sound  of a  rocking  rocking springs  in a vehicle  can we have  that  i'm just  guessing  those are  clips i don't  know  okay  how about  the sound  give me the  sound of mace  being sprayed  all right 
[03:54:30]  here's some of  the sounds  uh  ooze  ooze  yes  uh swords  clashing  clashing  so you need  some you know  ting ting ting  swords uh  clashing  blocking and  hitting  yes  what would that  entail like  what's that sound  like sounds of  quiet  oh okay  it's a fully artist  over here  okay  so  stuff on the  elbows  and yeah just  pull that clip  why didn't you  just do that  into the mic  there's no need  to have a clip  why are you  beating yourself  up  i like this 
[03:55:00]  one  the sound  of wind  the sound  wind  sound  sound  the sound  wind  sound  the sound  wind makes  when it  passes through  my ears  from a weapon  being wielded  so it's that  yeah  well without  playing this  thing like  crazy  i do that  with the  stick  and is  that  kiyi  what is that  called  kiyi  is  i get the  sound of  the audience  that will be  listening to  the master  poe show  oh good  oh no 
[03:55:30]  that's implying  that there's  no one  listening  oh opie  you're implying  that after that  huge intro  everything else  would be so  boring that  you could hear  crickets chirping  in the background  well he does  have a pretty  good lead in  yeah what's that  uh yeah uh  post show will  come on directly  following uh  big kev's geek  stuff  all right  wow  why don't you  beat up kev's  show  that'd be kind  of cool they  could talk about  geeky things and  you could come  in and whip  them  ow  leave him  alone  where's eric  god i love 
[03:56:00]  this kid  where's eric  this kid has  balls  what is this  true  oh no  go ahead  eric  our next witness  yes  from what i  was told  um  poe has been  doing some  pre-interviews  for his  upcoming show  oh wow  nothing wrong  with that  very helpful  guys industrious  haven't heard  all of it  but he asked  me to help  him transfer  some stuff  that he  recorded here  um  he was here  one night  you got  recordings of 
[03:56:30]  him interviewing  potential guests  yeah but we  wanted to save  it to let him  debut it on his  show  oh this audio  you're gonna use  on the show  okay yeah  that's fair  we don't want  to take any  audio from the  show  so i'm asking  him what's  this audio  about  did you tell  me that you  had ex-cons  up here  to do an  interview in the  assembly studio  yes  let me just  point out the  assembly studio  is a closet  with one  microphone  so while he's  doing his  interview you  hear they have 
[03:57:00]  the old rubber  handles so you  hear the mic being  swung around  and he's trying  to conduct people  to talk into the  microphone  so pull it back  to himself  where did you  learn to fight  once you were  in jail  well it was  pretty rough  you kind of  gotta learn  when you're  in there  so  did you  become proficient  in your  fighting skills  yes 
[03:57:30]  wow  yeah these guys  are pretty  tough  you have  one guy  that was  in prison  for 20  years  he must have  loved being  in that room  i'm surprised  he didn't  lose his  mind  for doing  that  finger in  the asshole  move  the shocker  he did it  while babysitting  so now 
[03:58:00]  20 years  for drugs  he's a  martial artist  i don't  consider him  to be a  martial artist  he's a  fighter  and he's  a fighter  for an art  called 52  blocks  this is  something that  i was  introduced  when i was  15 years  old  when i was  a young  young boy  what's 52  blocks  52 blocks  is an art  that was  developed  in prison  and it  consists of  elbows  head butts  and it's  quite dangerous  are these guys  good fighters  yes  very good  rorschach  tests on  people's 
[03:58:30]  ass cheeks  that's another  art  a young guy  that  that i grew  up with  his name  was  vakim  and unfortunately  he was into  gangs and  always getting  into trouble  i couldn't  persuade him to  go to the  martial arts  and try to be  disciplined  and not do  the wrong  thing  so he was  always getting  into trouble  and going  in and out  of jail  but when he  would come  out  we would  spar  and we  would go  over the  techniques  and it  was quite  different  than martial  arts  it's  very very  effective  there's a  lot of  elbows  and knees 
[03:59:00]  to the face  and snapping  of necks  and pretty  interesting  so they talk  about prison  fighting  yes it's  prison fighting  so any weapons  shanks and  things like that  uh yes  he uh mentioned  uh well i don't  want to say over  the air because  this is part of  the part of the  oh yeah yeah  let's just say  that he was  attacked  why have people  actually hear  your stuff  you can entice  people with it  entice  this guy  was attacked 
[03:59:30]  by three guys  in a  in a uh  in a prison  boring  one guy came  in and  wanted to  end his life  he came in  with a knife  and was gonna  kill him  and then after  that was taken  care of  there was two  other guys  waiting outside  the cell  and he had  to take care  of those two  as well  is he still  living this guy  yes  is he still  in jail  no he's out  he's coming  here  the black guy  yes  it sucks  all right  well what's  the last thing  on the list  some kind  of tie  what is it  tiki  barber 
[04:00:00]  no  kiai  kiai  is that like  a war cry  yeah when  you see the  karate  you know  your typical  yeah you go  ha  what are some  of the kiais  ha  what's your  kiai  everybody has  their own  there you go  whoa  what is it  I would scare  Sam's just laughing  what the fuck  are you laughing at  Sam why are you laughing at  you are gonna  that's the last thing  you're gonna hear  before you're actually 
[04:00:30]  snapped in two  I'm just saying  he's sitting there like  before he knocks  the last bit of black  out of you  Jesus  what a fucking  feather duster  he's getting angry  at the mic  and just yell  it just  all right yeah  get angry at the mic  and give it again  that's a good sound clip  well I'm not getting  angry at the mic  you see if I get up  and I do that  by your ear  you would feel it  all throughout your body  because it's a way  of frightening your opponent  yeah but he's laughing  at your kiai  oh damn it 
[04:01:00]  that's probably  the opposite  of what you want  to happen  all right  go ahead Sam  get on mic  all right  Po like  do your thing now  do your kiai  I bet you I can  make you blink  whoa  oh shit  what a fucking  sarcastic  dick bag  all right Sam  all right here we go  Po is literally  six inches from Sam  now remember  the element of surprise  is what wins all  so whenever you're 
[04:01:30]  in a street situation  and you're able  to get to your opponent  wait what is that again  because we're filming this  I want to see  we definitely want to get  footage of Sam  shit in his pants  so start over  well Sam's all right  the element of surprise  wins all  and when you're not ready  Sam didn't move  for the record  Sam didn't even blink  wow  well Sam also knows  that Po's not going  to really hit him  that's true too  he knows it's not  like a fight thing  can I tell you how  Po blew it  because you said  the element of surprise  which let him know 
[04:02:00]  to be ready  when he wasn't  supposed to be ready  you probably should  have said something else  like the difference  between you  you should have  started off differently  by the way  it's coming in  a few times here  yes we have a new  stinger after the  line of the day  Jimmy what would  yours be  hey  I don't think  that would be  very effective  it would so  yeah  hey  why you  all right  that was  very interesting  stuff  so the show's  going to be  in less than  two weeks  Po  Marge what's yours  by the way  what's your 
[04:02:30]  key eye  oh I don't have  one  why  why  how can you  have one  I don't know  it just comes out  naturally if I have  to do it  I mean  I don't know  should you have  one  no I don't  have one  Po should he  have one  that's entirely  up to him  there's war  screams  there's key eyes  what's a war scream  oh if you're  running across  the room  and you have  a sword in  your hand  you're ready  all right  yeah get over  there  give us your  war scream  please  get him a  cordless  yeah  no no no  I want to  hear it coming  at you  oh so you  got to have  it in the  distance  I need a  weapon  all right  here's your  weapon  you're coming 
[04:03:00]  at us  yeah here  take the mic  stand  this is  the sound  now you  practice these  sounds in  front of a mirror  you probably  practice any  of them  close to making  the cut  and then you  said no to  no no  when you're  fighting  all right  all right  Poe get  across the  studio  this is  going to be  too heavy  here  attack with  this banana  a banana  all right  make believe  it's your  sword  I have a  stick  inside  all right  get your  stick  thank you 
[04:03:30]  all right  he needs  a stick  hey can I  have my  banana back  all right  he's got a  stick  all right  so Poe  just yell from  across the room  this is the  noise you would  make as you're  running across  the room with  your weapon to  kill somebody  but he didn't  run  shouldn't you  be running  and doing that  same time  all right  let's try it  again  no because I  want to hear  it coming at  me  all right  on three  back up a  little bit  right to the  console  all right  that would be 
[04:04:00]  uh  fuck yeah  it'd be  you don't  see that  coming at you  no fucking  way  that would be  rather unpleasant  uh by the way  boogie from  richmond is  saying what  is that  called again  a ki-i  ki-i  ki-i  uh boogie  saying that  ants would  be  here's uh  another here's  a couple of  celebrity uh  ki-is  and then uh
