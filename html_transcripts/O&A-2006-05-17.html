<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie, Anthony, and James Norton in studio, welcoming guest William Donahue from the Catholic League, who extended good wishes following past controversies.  The hosts immediately launched into their signature brand of self-deprecating and offensive humor, targeting themselves, their crew (Hurricane Ben, Martini Steve, E-Rock, Aaron), and various public figures.

A substantial portion of the show focused on *The Sopranos*, specifically a recent episode featuring a homosexual relationship, which the hosts discussed using homophobic slurs.  This transitioned into a scathing critique of *American Idol*, targeting the judges (particularly Paula Abdul), contestants (Catherine McPhee, Elliot Yamin, and Chris Daughtry), laced with insults and offensive language.  A caller corrected Opie on a misremembered *Gilligan's Island* joke.

Other topics included Barry Bonds (reacting to him being hit by a pitch, with offensive language and stereotypes), *House* (mocking its dramatic plots), and “Whip Em Out Wednesday (WOW),” including discussion of related legal issues and distributed stickers.  They played audio of a sexually explicit and delusional stalker's messages targeting a DJ,  followed by a discussion of the Pentagon attack video, criticizing the government's delayed release and conspiracy theories.  The show also featured a discussion on pit bulls, with offensive language and stereotypes used to contrast pit bull aggression with other breeds.  Callers “Big John” and Dan offered opposing perspectives on pit bull temperament, with Dan recounting an attack.  An audio clip of an angry pit bull owner refusing an interview after his dogs mauled children was played.

The Paul McCartney and Heather Mills separation was the next topic, with numerous jokes targeting Mills's prosthetic leg. Brother Joe then joined the studio as a guest, contributing a segment on tribute bands, playing audio clips and offering critiques, often with irreverent comments.  The show’s momentum shifted dramatically with the surprise arrival of the Stanley Cup, a guest appearance by its custodian, and stories about its history and care.  The hosts’ initial skepticism about a replica contrasted sharply with their awe at seeing the real trophy.

This led to a segment documenting the hosts' live walk with the Stanley Cup from their studio to XM Satellite Radio studios.  The humorous misspelling of "Stanley" by studio employee Derek led to much on-air mockery, ultimately confirmed by the Cup's custodian.  Listener calls shared hockey anecdotes, including stories of the Cup being left in unusual places.  Jimmy Norton provided a humorous, off-key rendition of Johnny Cash's "Hurt".  During the walk, the hosts interacted with passersby, some recognizing the Cup, others not.  Their conversation drifted to desired future studio guests and artifacts (World War II memorabilia, Neil Armstrong's space suit), and included crude and sexually charged comments about women they encountered, along with complaints about other radio shows allegedly copying their bits.

A later segment began with a derisive discussion of *Tango & Cash*, followed by a critique of Will Smith’s dialogue in *Independence Day*.  Jamie Kennedy was announced as an upcoming guest.  Listener calls discussed items to bring to the show (ranging from *The Shining*'s axe to Bud Dwyer’s gun), culminating in a “Daily Dump Report” cataloging instances of on-air profanity.  A caller shared a traffic citation allegedly filled out by Kurt Cobain's father.

Jamie Kennedy then joined the show, and a significant portion focused on the hosts’ "Pal Talk" webcam interactions with female viewers exposing themselves, including one showing genitals and tattoos.  Discussions of other outrageous Pal Talk incidents followed, including a man being stunned with a stun gun on his genitals and anus by his wife.  The conversation shifted to the Stanley Cup, Jamie Kennedy's MTV show (compared to *Tenacious D*), Frank Gorshin's death, and pranks Kennedy pulled (including a pig's head in Bob Saget's fridge).  O.J. Simpson’s “Juiced” video was played, followed by a phone call attempting to embarrass Kennedy by referencing an alleged relationship with Neve Campbell using the phrase "Ramone."  The hosts concluded by summarizing segments, including a David Ortiz interview by producer Ben and promised online photos.

A disastrous interview with Red Sox player Ben Sparks followed, repeatedly interrupted by mockery and off-topic tangents, including a joke about a celebrity’s penis and references to *The Shining*.  This was followed by “Brother Joe's Dumb Game,” identifying real vs. tribute bands, with vulgar language.  A lengthy *Tango & Cash* bit with Jimmy Norton followed, with offensive language and listener calls, plugs for appearances, and a discussion of a pit bull attack. The segment concluded with the hosts reading emails between a writer and a critical listener, including threats and insults.

The broadcast concluded with a discussion contrasting the radio show and podcast, highlighting greater freedom of speech in the latter, specifically mentioning an unbroadcastable segment featuring "Captain McCunt."  The hosts engaged in self-deprecating humor regarding past segments, including a poorly-received Jim Norton bit, a car wreck anecdote, and the disastrous Ben Sparks interview,  jokingly referring to their show as a "carpet bombing" of shocking content. The conversation included jokes about Jimmy Norton's lack of recognition and culminated in crude, sexually suggestive banter, including a nickname involving "cunt" and a reference to "Whip them out Wednesday."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202, featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Ladies and gentlemen, introducing William Donahue, President of the Catholic League.  We all screw up. You guys are obviously very talented fellas.  I mean, you wouldn't have done so well before, and then you bounced back very quickly.  So, I mean, you've got a great audience out there.  So what am I going to do? Just sit around here and lambate Opie and Anthony for the rest of my life?  I don't go around holding grudges with people. You know, I move on.  And, you know, I just wish you well. I just wish you well. Wish you well. Wish you well. 
[00:00:30]  Push the button! Push the button!  Can you hear me?  No! Shut up!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow. We're dummies.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We dank.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:01:00]  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  Jesus.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing. We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  We hair like Chuck.  No, that is...  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care!  Shut up!  No!  What's wrong, Aaron? 
[00:01:30]  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax. Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Ass.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  You will keep your hands off of my meal. 
[00:02:00]  You like Huey Lewis on the news?  Thank you, Kenny.  He's a fag!  Nobody's got AIDS.  Hi.  Hi, Anthony.  Hi, Jimmy.  This is the Opian Anthony Show. 
[00:02:30]  1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Hearing those soprano clips reminds me of the discussion we had just before we went on the air, Anthony.  Yes.  Anthony looks at me and goes, have you caught up with the Sopranos?  Did you catch up?  DVR, you know?  Got to DVR things because we're much too exhausted during normal working hours to have a life of any sort to watch the Sopranos when it actually airs on Sunday. 
[00:03:00]  And I told you that the gay crap is just taking me out of the game.  The gay stuff is so goddamn funny that you cannot watch it.  And they didn't disperse it enough.  But the last episode, which was Sunday, but I just caught it last night, was really funny.  Where his little fireman friend and him profess their love for each other in the kitchen.  And when Fat Vito just turns to his little fireman buddy and goes, I love you, Johnny Cakes. 
[00:03:30]  I lost my mind.  Oh, it was hysterical.  And then at one point they crawl into bed and they're spooning with a Vito laying down on his side.  And then the fireman guy comes up behind him, Johnny Cakes, and kind of spoons him from behind.  And then they just show, they go back to Bobby Bacala, who's playing with his train set, and they just show a train go into a tunnel. 
[00:04:00]  An old sight gag.  It was hysterical.  That sounds really funny.  Yeah, it was pretty funny.  And then things, of course, turned a little tragic.  See, I don't know what happened.  I think because they took seven years off between seasons, I'm just not into it as I used to be.  I don't think anyone's as into it as they were the first few seasons, but it's still pretty good. 
[00:04:30]  I think it really hurt the show to take that much time off.  I think people finally got really frustrated.  Yeah.  Because then, you know, if you take that much time between seasons, you really expect a lot.  Your expectations are a lot higher.  Because you're like, hey, if they're spending, you know, years or whatever it was, what, over two years, two and a half years?  Yeah, there were times where it was over two years between seasons.  Your expectations are way up there because you're thinking, oh, it's got to be really, really good that they're taking this long to complete their next season.  And then you watch it, it's like, eh, it's all right. 
[00:05:00]  It's all right.  It's aight.  It's aight.  So, I think it's getting better.  Johnny Sacks copped a plea.  Hey, Frank Vincent was hysterical in that.  He had a very small part in the episode I watched, but very funny, very animated.  He's very, very pissed about the whole thing with Johnny Sacks copping a plea.  Because when you do that, you've got to stand up and kind of accept the crime that you committed. 
[00:05:30]  So, they asked him if he had been part of the Cosa Nostra for 10 years, and he said yes.  And they're watching the telecast, and Frank Vincent's just like, oh, you don't even, you don't fess up to, you know, the existence of this thing.  He goes, I did 20 years.  I did 20 years.  You know, he goes, he's got to take it like a man.  So, they're all pissed at him, and I don't see good things coming of that.  So, it should get real interesting, is what you're saying? 
[00:06:00]  Well, it should, but that's the thing with the Sopranos.  It should get interesting.  And then every time they go, next time on the Sopranos, you watch the little trailer that they have for it.  It's all action.  Everything's great.  You see in gunfire, you go, oh, my God, what's happening to this guy?  And then the episode plays, and you go, what happened to all that stuff in the trailer?  You realize that's like five seconds of the episode.  Yeah.  But because it's in a promo, it makes it look like it's the entire show.  Yeah, what happened?  What happened is right.  So, yeah, I'm finally caught up, though, and the gay stuff, I don't think you're going to have to be worrying about that anymore. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, no, don't tell me.  I didn't see it.  Yeah, I'll just say I don't think you're going to have to worry about that anymore.  Johnny Cakes is okay, isn't he?  Johnny Cakes is fine, but he could be a little heartbroken.  That's my favorite.  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  When he said that, oh, did I almost Ralph.  I'm not gay, but a man like Johnny Cakes will make you feel safe. 
[00:07:00]  He's just terrific.  Johnny Cakes, he likes Vito's bad hips as he's walking.  He can barely walk.  He's just wobbling.  One part that was...  You sure it's bad hips?  Yeah, I know.  After the spooning with the fireman.  Or it's Johnny Hot Cakes, or what's his name?  Johnny Cakes.  Oh, just Johnny Cakes.  Maybe Johnny Cakes.  He's coming to his diner and ordered a Johnny Cakes.  Maybe he's walking like that because Johnny Cakes is packing.  Packing a fire hose.  And the next scene, they show a train coming out of the tunnel and going all over someone's face. 
[00:07:30]  There's a train in his hair.  Anyway.  Yeah, there was one part that was pretty funny if you're a working guy.  They have Vito who, you know, for years has been mobbed up  and doesn't really know what manual labor or working is.  And he's up in Vermont, or was it?  Or New Hampshire?  New Hampshire.  New Hampshire.  And he, you know, he's in love with his Johnny Cakes. 
[00:08:00]  So he figures he's going to just get a legitimate job.  And he got this handyman job where he's got to do some carpentry.  And he's sawn some wood and he's thinking.  You hear him thinking out loud about what time it is.  And he goes, it's got to be 10 o'clock.  It's got to be.  Don't look at your watch.  Don't look at your watch.  It's got to be 10.  It goes, soon it'll be lunch.  And this effing day will be half over.  It's all right.  11.  11.  30.  Maybe even a quarter to 12.  Don't look.  Don't look at your watch.  And he just keeps doing that over.  He goes, okay.  All right.  Give yourself a treat. 
[00:08:30]  Take a look.  And he looks.  It's like 5 to 10.  And he just loses his mind.  And that's where he pretty much was convinced that this life just might not be for him.  Yeah.  Even though he loves his Johnny Cakes.  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  He's going to have to leave Johnny Cakes behind.  Yeah.  Well, literally, he's behind his front everything.  Poor Johnny Cakes.  I was too busy watching that American Idol last night.  Yeah, I caught up on that, too.  I should have watched The Sopranos because I do have it all on DVR. 
[00:09:00]  But, whatever.  American Idol is just a joke.  I mean, it's obvious that Chris Daughtry should have won the whole thing.  And now that he got kicked off the show, it's not even worth watching the show.  You're watching these people up there, the last three, Catherine McPhee and Taylor Hicks.  And Elliot, whatever his name.  Elliot, whatever his name.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, na.  I mean.  And, uh.  I mean.  What is it?  He's so forgettable.  Yeah.  I mean.  Yeah.  Elliot, I mean.  It's a forgettable show.  I call Chris Chrissy Cakes. 
[00:09:30]  That's what I used to call him.  And now he's gone.  Where's my Chrissy Cakes?  Right.  It's just.  It ain't worth watching.  You watch and just go.  There's no.  No, like.  You kind of looked forward to watching Chris sing a song because he has some stage presence.  Great voice and everything.  And now it's like these three.  And that McPhee.  They just let her in there to keep a girl in.  And Paul Abdul, I'm sorry, appeared to me to be so drugged out last night. 
[00:10:00]  Like she couldn't take the fact that Chris is gone.  And she seemed so drugged out and hated McPhee.  Like anything she did, she could do nothing right because she shouldn't be there.  She should be the one that got thrown out.  And there's no honesty with the show whatsoever because the controversy just exploded when Chris  Daugherty got kicked off and, you know, Chris Daugherty's all over the news, talking everywhere.  I mean, you know, just he just exploded after the show with the controversy and everything. 
[00:10:30]  So everyone was looking forward to American Idol last night to see how they would handle this  controversy that the best guy got kicked off without a doubt.  Yeah.  And also Ryan Seacrest said, yeah, you know, wow, that was a shocker last week.  Chris Daugherty got kicked off.  Hey, people, that means you just got to vote.  You got to vote.  You got to vote for your favorite.  Oh, that's it.  We got to vote.  Not talking about that possibly the phone system was screwed up.  They would never.  Yeah.  And then he doesn't even get the reaction of the judges that obviously last week were in 
[00:11:00]  shock and they showed Paula Abdul with her head in her hands, obviously crying her eyes  out.  And they don't even get the comments of the judges.  This is the first time they're having a show after the big controversy and they do nothing  with it.  Hose it down.  They just hose it down like it didn't really happen and move on with these three contestants  that don't deserve to be the next American Idol.  They just don't have it.  Mediocre.  They're good in their own right.  I mean, Catherine McPhee has all the talent in the world, but she's just not focused. 
[00:11:30]  I don't think she's got all the talent in the world.  She's got a hell of a singing voice, but she's just not focused.  She's got a good voice.  She's got some range.  She doesn't have any, she can't hold a note very long, like those high notes.  A real good singer of her type can hold a note at the end for a long time and it's very  impressive.  She's off key a lot, a lot.  But she over-dramatizes every friggin' song she sings with that little crackle in her 
[00:12:00]  voice and a little sparkle in her eye.  Two years, she's going to be another hundred pounds also.  You could tell.  She's at that point in her age where it looks all good, but that package is ready to expand.  You notice that she's never been told anything bad in her life, by the way?  Never.  Her entire life has been a life of everyone just kissing her ass and saying how great she  is.  Because every time the judges go, I don't know, it wasn't your best performance, she's 
[00:12:30]  like, oh my God, really?  And looking at her mommy in the audience like, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy shakes it.  No, no, it was great.  Mommy, what?  It was fantastic.  You've been telling me I'm great since I was two.  You're wonderful.  And then the rumor is George Clooney offered her a part in a movie already.  Oh, a part in a movie.  It's like, no, George Clooney wants to get in your pants.  Of course.  Well, that does mean that George Clooney is going to get in your pants if he offers you  a part in a movie.  Apparently that happens like every time.  Oh, really? 
[00:13:00]  Any girl he works with gets a little George Clooney.  Good for him.  Yeah.  But he should do it.  They cut to the train going through the tunnel scene.  George Clooney Express.  Toot, toot.  Do you want to hear any of the performances from last night?  Oh.  Taylor Hicks did Joe Cocker.  You are so beautiful.  Yeah.  Um, Catherine McPhee did Somewhere Over the Rainbow.  Yeah.  Which, yeah.  Simon picked that one.  Now, Simon, Simon's always criticizing song selection throughout the entire series. 
[00:13:30]  And then he picks that hack song.  It is a hack song for these competitions.  It's, it's, it's like going in with, if you're a stand-up comic, uh, and, and going with a  Gilligan's Island professor to fix the hole in the boat, why can't he make a radio out  of a coconut joke?  That's a good one.  I was going to go with the airplane.  Use it.  It's yours, Jimmy.  I was going to go with the airplane joke.  The airplane peanut joke.  Right.  Exactly.  It's just the hack joke.  Hack.  I think if Jimmy sang Somewhere Over the Rainbow, we'd all cry.  It's just one of those songs. 
[00:14:00]  I think we would, too.  It's just one of those songs, if you sing it, people cry.  It doesn't, you know?  So it's very easy to get an audience behind you when you're singing a song like that.  But it's, why, why do you cry like, when you hear that stupid song?  Because it's just very emotional.  It's Dorothy.  You sing it, it'll always be Dorothy.  We're over.  Yeah.  Oh.  So overdramatic.  We are high.  It stinks. 
[00:14:30]  She's like off with the music, trying to throw her own arrangement in.  We're.  Daddy.  I heard of.  She had to start real low.  She's awful.  We're.  We're.  We're.  We're.  We're.  We're.  We're.  We're.  We're.  We're.  We're.  We're.  We're.  We're.  We're.  We're.  We're.  She's like Ted Nye.  Okay, Pookie.  And wake up.  The clouds are far behind me.  Christen the boat, Pookie. 
[00:15:00]  We're troubled.  Lemon drops.  Away.  Away.  Above the chimney tops.  That's where.  You'll find me.  Out on the dock, christening my new sleuth.  Okay, Pookie.  Pookie.  Pookie.  How'd you like to mow my lawn?  Over the rainbow.  She's got a voice, but.  Pookie, Pookie, Pookie, Pookie, Pookie, Pookie. 
[00:15:30]  Whoa.  Pookie.  Pookie, Pookie.  Pookie.  Pookie.  Pookie.  Pookie.  It's easy to grin when your ship comes in and you've got the stock market beat.  The man worthwhile is the man who can smile when his shorts are too tight in the seat.  Okay, pookie.  Okay, pookie.  Well, we're waiting. 
[00:16:00]  Josh and Philly, what's up?  Yo, guys, what's going on?  Hey, man.  He's going to be under the bus because he was talking about the Gilligan's Island thing.  He said the professor fixed the hole in the boat but couldn't make a radio out of a coconut.  You're right.  What a backwards ass I am.  He could make a radio out of a coconut but he couldn't fix the hole in the boat.  I said it backwards.  I said he could fix the hole in the boat but he can't make a radio out of a coconut.  I screwed up the hackiest joke ever.  You just stated facts. 
[00:16:30]  That's how they got off the island and there was no show.  Thank you.  I'm an ass.  The show lasted one time.  I am a jerk.  They had one show because he fixed the boat right away.  I fixed the boat.  Thank God we had a professor here.  He couldn't make a radio out of the coconut but we're sailing home.  Even as a kid, I couldn't buy into that gag that they were going to get rescued.  I'm like, but if they get rescued, the show's over.  Show's over.  They're not fixing this hole anytime soon.  At seven years old, you were screaming, why don't they just kill Gilligan? 
[00:17:00]  I hated that show.  It was awful.  I've had bigger laughs watching little tires come over from Cuba with a child's hat and nothing else on it.  It just wasn't funny.  It was awful with a laugh track.  It was everything that's wrong with Bobby.  Laugh tracks are always funny.  Are we done with Idol?  Oh, please.  I mean, literally.  Done with it.  Like I said, I was watching.  Why am I watching?  Chris Daughtry should be on this show still. 
[00:17:30]  He's not.  It's not even worth watching.  No outstanding talent.  Yeah, no one stepped forward last night at all.  No, very mediocre.  You could see that on a cruise ship.  Who gets kicked off?  That's who you see.  You would see Elliot, Elliot Kameen, like on a cruise ship.  You'd see, what's her face there?  Catherine.  Catherine.  Hopefully on a...  You'd see her in a lounge.  In a lounge.  She's a lounge act singer or a wedding band or something. 
[00:18:00]  I want to see her on a treadmill.  Yeah, well, that would be good.  And then the other guy, you would just see at some local dive bar.  Right.  Doing a gig.  Belting it out.  You know, I hope gets kicked off Ryan Seacrest T-cells.  Well, I think they are.  They kind of make a lot of gay jokes.  He's on E! now doing the E! News thing.  Yeah.  And his co-host seems to make a lot of gay jokes about him.  And he doesn't really fight back.  Right.  He, at one point, stared into her eyes and went to lean in to kiss her real slowly. 
[00:18:30]  And she recoiled.  And he goes, I was just joking.  And she kind of made a statement like, yeah, well, that's obvious that you were joking.  Like, you wouldn't be kissing a girl.  Hmm.  No.  All right.  Who gets kicked off?  Just to play it out.  Who gets kicked off?  Elliot.  It's got to be Elliot.  Elliot.  But now, who the hell knows?  And who cares?  Who knows?  You never know with this show.  You just don't know.  I love you, Johnny Cakes. 
[00:19:00]  Is that it?  Yeah.  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  Let me hear that again.  It's so bad.  I'd rather not.  This big, fat Dago.  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  Where's the chubby queen?  I want to hear him.  I don't know what's going on.  That was after Johnny Cakes leaned over and kissed his neck as he was cooking.  And said, you don't understand.  I love you.  It doesn't feel like queuing up again.  Johnny Cakes is so much more handsome than Vito. 
[00:19:30]  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  Johnny Cakes.  All right.  Why don't we get on track today?  We got to take a break.  Let's fight these tents in our jeans after that line.  What are we doing today?  Oh, the Barry Bond stuff from last night.  If you haven't heard yet, it's just terrific.  It is really, really good stuff.  We got Jimmy singing along to Johnny Cash's Hurt from yesterday's show.  We got to play it again.  Just a piece, anyway.  It made me laugh really, really hard all day long.  We got a new house promo we could goof. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, we got a DJ here in New York City that's being stalked.  Let me guess.  Someone on house came in with something that seemed like the sniffles, yet ended up to be the black plague of the 1500s.  And only house could cure it by somehow eating a baby's head.  Is that the episode?  Or is it the one from last week?  Wow.  Jesus.  Enough with the house.  What's wrong, Doc?  I'm a hypochondriac. 
[00:20:30]  I sneezed and now there's blood in my boxers.  Well, let's hear what the...  On an all new house.  Let's see how good this one is.  Which one of you is house?  Next Tuesday on the season finale.  What was the patient of yours?  Oh, I'm going to leave the chocolates downstairs.  Shocking, isn't it?  Who'd want to hurt you?  What begins as an act of revenge.  Why did you try to kill me?  I want to see you, son.  Will become the most shocking episode of the season.  You're killing a man. 
[00:21:00]  I think I'm losing my mind.  This is one finale that has it all.  Oh, God.  I don't know.  Whoa.  There's not much there.  Not much there, but the fact that they called it the most shocking episode of the season  when I swear to you, every episode is billed as the most shocking episode of House.  House.  How is House going to save a young woman who came in with a tummy ache and now her liver 
[00:21:30]  is coming out her ears?  Only House can save her by killing 20 people.  I have to kill 20 people.  House, you can't kill 20 people.  Will House kill 20 people to save one house?  Shut up.  Shocking.  Oh, and then I start thinking, my liver's coming out my ears because I got a headache.  He's the MacGyver of the ER.  He is.  He truly is.  He just figures out all this stuff.  Can MacGyver use a map of Egypt and a needle and thread to fix a woman who came in with a 
[00:22:00]  foot hurting disease and now her heart is coming out her nose.  We have to smash her heart back in her nose.  How are we going to do it, House?  I don't know.  Let me grab a patient from another room and use his kneecap.  House.  Shocking.  People love that damn show.  They love the show.  It's huge in the ratings.  I don't get it.  It's a little too dramatic for me.  I get scared to watch it. 
[00:22:30]  I can't watch the show and I don't know.  If I watch the show and I'm leaning in bed the wrong way and my arm goes to sleep, I go,  I got the house thing and I just start thinking I'm going to have to kill someone to save me.  Just like House.  All right.  With that.  With that.  We got to step aside.  We step aside.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday, House.  Whip Em Out Wednesday on an all new Opie and Anthony. 
[00:23:00]  The most shocking Whip Em Out Wednesday ever.  The season finale of WOW where Opie and Anthony have to go out and kill seven women to get  14 breasts.  A shocking O&A.  The show is awful.  And I get email after email.  Dude, you got to check it out.  It's a great show.  I can't.  I'm a hypochondriac.  There you have it.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The O&A virus spreading across. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, no.  A virus.  House.  I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says.  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female enemies.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Weekday mornings.  Do it like this.  Was that a few curses there? 
[00:24:00]  Were you cursing?  Ah, if you were the guys down the hall.  I was cursing at Club Soda Kenny.  You were cursing on him?  I wield an iron fist during the breaks here.  I'm happy-go-lucky Anthony until the mics go off and then people fear me.  Let them fear you.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday, by the way.  It certainly is.  We're trying to get that old gag going again.  That old gag.  That old nag.  It is spring, and I think the ladies out there should be helping us along a little bit. 
[00:24:30]  We beat that dead horse, don't we?  Of course we do.  But all the fine stations we're on through CBS, they're getting WOW stickers printed up.  I think you can get them through the website eventually.  That's what I'm thinking.  I know Boston has theirs done.  New York has theirs done.  Philly is just about done with their WOW stickers.  And I believe if you go to the website of the station you're listening on, they'll explain how to get the WOW stickers.  Of course, that's for Whip Em Out Wednesday.  You get the WOW sticker on your car, and there are ladies out there that will flash you if they see the WOW sticker. 
[00:25:00]  Yes.  It's been happening for many, many, many years, and it will continue.  We just ask you, do not harass the ladies.  There are plenty of ladies out there that will just do it on their own.  Yeah.  All right.  That just happens.  Speaking of flash, we were just looking at our girlfriend across the way in the building, and that's why I curse to Kenny.  He pulls out a piece of paper with a law on it, you know, thinking he's got some kind of background in law. 
[00:25:30]  Stupid laws.  Stupid law.  He's got some kind of background in some law.  You might have read about it in the paper.  But there's all kinds of things, laws and stuff, as to peering into windows and stuff.  So I'm reading this.  Peering into a dwelling.  You're committing a crime of a fourth degree.  Blah, blah, blah.  It goes down just talking about, you know, peering into structures that are overnight accommodations for the purpose of invading privacy of another person under circumstances, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:26:00]  And then the last line says, invading the privacy of another person and under circumstances in which a reasonable person in the dwelling or other structure would not expect to be observed.  That right there clinches it.  The person you're looking at has to reasonably believe that they are in a position that they cannot be observed.  She is in front of a gigantic picture window with not a curtain, a shade, or blinds, completely naked. 
[00:26:30]  Right.  That, to me, is not a reasonably believing that you won't be observed with, by the way, a building right across the way.  That has many, many windows.  Right.  And we're not lurking in the shrubs.  I mean, we're just standing here in the office.  Look, we can not look out the window.  Don't look.  She might be there.  We're going to jail.  Yeah.  I guess we're going to compromise and make sure we don't take out our hogs anymore.  That, I'm stuck. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Oh, hey, Perry idiot.  Stupid Kenny.  Stupid Kenny.  I just try to do my part and bring stuff to the table.  That's why I was cursing at him, because he was trying to cuff me and bring me in during spots, and I'm busy.  Why don't you explain why we shouldn't be doing WOW anymore?  Why don't you really wreck the entire show while you're at it?  No, I don't want to be a buzzkill.  Eventually, we'll just be doing sports scores and the weather for cities all over America. 
[00:27:30]  Well, you know, the thing is.  Time and temp.  That could be illegal.  If you told the temperature and you're a couple of degrees off, read this.  You could be sued for wrong weather.  Shut up.  You know, whatever you guys do, you're so talented.  It'll be terrific.  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you, Kenny.  Oh, not traffic.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right, moving on.  That's illegal.  We've got a very busy show today.  Brother Joe's here.  He's got some fine stuff for the program.  Certainly.  We're going to get to that in a little bit. 
[00:28:00]  Also, got to talk about Bonds really fast.  Oh, yeah.  This was just terrific last night.  I think I got the story, but the audio's not that great, so let's see if we can get through it.  If not, we'll explain.  Classic.  No Barry Bonds home run Tuesday night, but fireworks of a different kind.  In the fifth inning, Bonds was hit by Astros reliever Russ Springer.  After home plate umpire Joe West warned both benches, Springer's next four pitches were inside,  with the last one drilling Bonds in the right shoulder, getting Springer and manager Phil Garner ejected. 
[00:28:30]  If I'm going to hit somebody, I'm going to try to hit him with a slider, but it's a tough call.  I didn't think it was warranted, but it's a tough call.  The last three Bonds-Springer matchups have gone like this.  Home run, hit by pitch, and hit by pitch.  Both players were unavailable after the game.  Bonds won't start on Wednesday, but that doesn't mean the game won't be interesting.  One Giants player told me there should be some retaliation. 
[00:29:00]  You know what?  Oh, boy.  I hope this starts a new trend.  I hope they all start throwing at Bonds and he never gets to a 7-14.  They just wail him?  Just wail him every time he's at bat.  Because what they didn't explain in that news report, when Springer did that last night,  and they kicked him out of the game, the place went nuts.  Standing ovation for the pitcher.  Yeah.  Standing ovation.  He gets hit in the head a few times.  By the end of the season, he's in adult diapers.  He finishes at 7-13.  That giant head.  And they're sitting him out so he can go back to San Francisco so he has a better shot 
[00:29:30]  of tying Ruth at home.  The guy is just not liked.  He's in a position where he should be a hero.  Every time he knocks a home run in, the place should go wild and this guy should be a hero.  And he has put himself in the position where he is just not liked.  Why wouldn't he sign that guy's ball?  That I don't get.  I can understand not talking to the sports writers because a lot of those are just scumbag guys.  Yeah, but a fan catches a ball. 
[00:30:00]  He's an Air Force guy.  Asked Bonds to sign the ball and he said no.  That's a pretty skanky move.  What was his excuse that the guy was going to turn around and sell it for a lot of money?  I don't know.  Who cares?  Even if he does.  How much money do you make?  What's the difference?  Who cares?  I mean, not that Barry Bonds has a 713th ball and a yellow discipline CD are the same thing.  Right.  But I don't mind signing anything.  Go ahead and sell it.  Jimmy will sign it.  Anything.  Anything.  Jimmy signs it.  I love you.  Jimmy Cakes.  Jimmy Cakes.  Good old Jimmy Cakes.  That is my new name.  Jimmy Cakes. 
[00:30:30]  I'm Jimmy Cakes.  Get used to it.  So nothing for Bonds last night and he sits out tonight.  And it's the whole steroid thing is why he's hated.  Yeah.  I mean, sure, he's going to break this record eventually.  But let's say just throw at him the rest of the year.  Just heaving the ball at him.  I would watch every single game.  I would laugh my ass off every night.  You know they would start just pressing charges, criminal charges against the pitchers.  Just.  They could do that.  It's illegal to hit the guy with the ball. 
[00:31:00]  Lawyer, Club Soda.  Club Soda Kenny Esquire.  Kenny picked me up this morning too and he's like, I almost brought some show prep in today  for you boys.  Great.  You want to explain the show prep, Kenny?  I'm sure it would have just been very good stuff.  No, I was like looking on the internet and I saw a thing like the top ten cities for road  rage.  Oh.  So I printed it out and I thought maybe, you know, because you guys like do live. 
[00:31:30]  And like it's a morning drive show and you know.  I'm getting mic rage with you talking.  And then I want to side swipe you with my microphone.  You stink.  The number one city, by the way, we don't broadcast in.  I read that on.  You read it.  Los Angeles.  No, Miami.  There's Miami.  How is Miami the number one for road rage?  A lot of Hispanics.  They're hot headed.  Is that what I hear?  They're bad drivers.  They annoy the five white people in the city.  A lot of immigrants.  Because L.A.  A lot of immigrants not driving right and they can't read the signs and all hell breaks loose. 
[00:32:00]  Is that it?  I don't know.  Do you know I read a survey on what annoys people the most as they're driving that gives  them road rage?  And number one was a cell phone guy.  No, I thought number one was listening to Club Soda Kenny on the radio.  That'll do it.  And you shouldn't be on the cell phone while you drive.  It's illegal.  Hands free, people.  Hands free.  But don't touch yourself while your hands are free.  This too could prosecute you.  I'll leave the entertainment. 
[00:32:30]  His mic's off.  Yeah, your mic is off.  You're just talking into a dead microphone.  Dope.  Mr. Mouthful of Food when he comes to the mic.  Can't stop feeding that giant body.  You know why the sky's clear today in New York?  Kenny put his hands up and whooshed the clouds away with his giant body.  He had enough.  He had enough.  I'm sick of the rain.  But while I was being driven to the station today, I was listening to 1010 Winds, trying  to get some headlines. 
[00:33:00]  And beside him saying, fee-fi-fo-fum.  I was like, yeah, can you turn up 1010 Winds?  He has a mustache like the fireman in The Sopranos.  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  I spend the whole ride over in the morning on my BlackBerry writing emails to people I don't  need to write emails to, so I don't have to get into an intelligent conversation with  Kenny.  Good luck with that.  You guys are terrific.  Fabulous and handsome.  So, yeah, I was listening to 1010 Winds, right? 
[00:33:30]  And there's this DJ in New York getting stalked.  Oh, really?  And we got the audio.  And it's very funny because everything they explain in this story happens to all of us.  Yeah, anyone in radio, you get these letters, you get phone calls, you get people coming  up to you, which is the scariest part.  But, yeah, you get stalked.  There are crazy people out there that believe that if you're broadcasting on television or  radio that you're talking to them.  It just happens all the time. 
[00:34:00]  They think you are speaking directly to them.  And to the person that thinks that right now, I am.  Oh, great.  I'm talking right to you right now.  And the only way to keep my dangerous voice out of your head is to put tinfoil over your  head.  Because I'm...  No, you.  Yeah.  You know the one that's going me right now?  Yeah.  You know what's going to happen now?  I'm going to get a bunch of letters.  No, when we do the walk later on this morning.  Tinfoil heads.  There's going to be a lot of the pest showing up with tinfoil on their head. 
[00:34:30]  It's illegal.  Shut up.  The reflection could blind a driver.  I printed it on the internet.  Are you taking a correspondence law course?  He's just...  I love him.  He's bull from Night Court.  I love you stupid cakes.  Dolt.  So here's the story.  DJ being stalked in New York.  Listen, and we got audio of the stalker.  Great.  You thought stalker Patty was crazy? 
[00:35:00]  Listen to this lady.  Cops have arrested a Hamilton Heights woman accused of talking to you, DJ Diane Pryor.  They say Kim Lebeskind has been sending sexually explicit emails and phone messages to Pryor for about a year now.  In the latest letter, Lebeskind allegedly wrote that she was going to do something outrageous.  She told Channel 7 that isn't true.  No, I never wrote to her saying that I was going to do something outrageous to get her attention.  I already had her attention.  In her letters and emails, she describes herself as a fan. 
[00:35:30]  Cops say it appears to be more than that.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  The boys didn't get it.  What happened?  That was in the clip?  No.  Okay.  Now we go through the who screwed up.  Danny's stepping right up.  I like Danny's strategy.  If I step up first, I won't be the last person in line to get the wrath.  I don't pass the buck.  It was your fault?  No, it's not my fault.  Oh, okay.  That's a basic.  Whose fault was it?  See, that's just a basic news report. 
[00:36:00]  The one I explained to Ben and the guys and Travis was that.  Yeah, absolutely I did.  In the office.  I got in 1230 last night.  I don't remember.  Was that she said something like, you know, we already have a relationship.  We kiss behind closed doors on the radio.  That's the clip you want.  That's the clip I asked for.  Travis, did I say that when I walked in?  Thank you.  At least he's nodding.  Oh, Travis.  Travis in the dunk tank.  For those of you that don't know, Travis sits where Robin used to sit. 
[00:36:30]  I love you, Travis Cakes.  Travis Cakes.  And he's just as useful as Robin.  Useless.  We ought to put him in blackface.  Can we do that one day?  Mammy, mammy, how I love you, how I love you, my dear old mammy.  Well, maybe we could get the...  I got the wrong clip.  I got the wrong clip.  Maybe we could get the clip where she sounds crazy because that would make her a much better radio.  It's wins because they always change the story.  Yeah, blame it on... 
[00:37:00]  Hey, you're going to take that?  Jimmy, you're going to take...  What's this world coming to?  I'll take it.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Because they switch it up all the time.  So there was no reason to play this version of the story.  Although she's got to be crazy because if you see a picture of the DJ she's stalking...  Yeah.  Oof.  Not hot?  Oof.  Yeah.  Although they did show like one photo of her from maybe 10 years ago where she kind of looked like she was together.  But it's, yeah, it's some kind of lesbian thing. 
[00:37:30]  That just happens, though.  It's a crazy stalker.  And the audio is great.  You know, she says how she's already kissed her behind closed doors on the radio.  So I don't know if she's making out with the radio while this woman's on or what.  Looking forward to her hearing that someday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that went nowhere.  That's great.  Wins does switch it up, though.  You know, I drive in.  I listen.  Funny clip about, if you could pull that one, too.  The crazy pit bull attack.  Some pit bull ripped a kid's ears off.  Ask Danny's drink there.  Ripped a child's ears off. 
[00:38:00]  Both of them?  Yeah.  And then some guy jumped in to help the kid.  And the pit bulls started eating him.  And they went for the guy that owns the pit bulls to interview him.  And it's impossible to air.  It's just him throwing out the F-bomb.  He calls the reporter a nigger.  He says, get the F out of here.  He's, yeah, very, very, very angry that the reporters were trying to get information from him about his deadly pit bulls. 
[00:38:30]  Was he a white gentleman?  No.  I believe in this city it's illegal for white people to own pit bulls.  Let's, Kenny?  Any, uh.  Yeah, just stay there, Kenny.  By the way, Stephen from Basher on the Instant Feedback, why are you guys busting on Kenny Cakes?  If he gets mad enough, he'll climb back up his beanstalk and you'll never see him again.  I smell the blood of an English man.  And then the other big story this morning is, of course, the tape of the Pentagon attack. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, well, uh, all the news organizations, uh, playing this one saying, well, this will shut up the conspiracy theorists.  No, it won't.  And by the way, it's like on page 10 of the papers that the Pentagon releases the tape.  I was so sleepy yesterday.  Well, no, why?  I wanted to go to sleep, but they were going to release this tape, and I sat there waiting and waiting, and then you see, like, the nose of the plane coming.  I never had any doubts that a plane hit the building. 
[00:39:30]  There's kooks out there, and don't even start, kooks out there that think it was something different.  This one shows a few more frames.  That's about it.  You see kind of the nose come in off of the right, hits the ground, and then the next thing is just a big explosion because, uh, uh, the frame rate is so slow.  The plane was moving a lot faster than the camera's frames were.  So you only see the nose of the plane, boom, explosion.  But it's obviously a plane, and, um, this was supposed to, you know, solve everything, but it's not. 
[00:40:00]  Well, why didn't they, this is annoying.  It's like, why does the government do this?  Why wouldn't you release that?  Why, there's no reason.  They just like to sit on things.  They said it would have interfered with the Moussaoui tribe.  It wouldn't have.  Ooh.  Just annoys me.  There's nothing, I saw the tape, but it was, it was, it was not informative at all.  I mean, it wouldn't have done anything.  Yeah.  To have released that back then.  Why was that sat on way before the Moussaoui show?  Why, why in 2001 did they release it?  I'll play the devil's advocate here. 
[00:40:30]  Can I buy your soul?  Yeah, sure.  Okay.  Well, you can fight for it in a fiddle battle.  I'm pretty good, old son.  Sit down in that chair right there.  He's not a hickory stump, there's a chair.  Who are these people?  All right, here's the audio of the new video of the 9-11 Pentagon attack.  At first glance, it's hard to make out the images taken by the Pentagon security camera  that morning.  But look closely at the lower right-hand corner.  Where?  This video appears to show the nose of an airplane. 
[00:41:00]  It comes into view briefly.  The next few frames show the Pentagon in flames.  That adds to images that have already been seen from another security camera 10 feet away.  A white streak in the lower right-hand corner, then the explosion.  We hope this completes the historical record and makes it clear these folks were the victims  of a murderous terrorist attack.  It's not going to quiet the conspiracy.  No, the conspiracy nuts will come up with 20 different reasons why it's not a plane, 
[00:41:30]  how it proves their point.  I've already been reading.  They said it looks like a missile.  I couldn't pick out anything.  The giganto missile?  Is that the one?  What kind of missile is that?  And it's totally consistent with the, there's this fenced-in area with the generator where  the right wing of the plane hit, and it's, it's, they show where poles are bent down,  the generator was moved.  It's completely consistent with hitting in that area.  Like, it backs up the claims that, yes, it is a plane, stupid, but they'll come up and 
[00:42:00]  say, yeah, it's a missile, it's obvious.  Yeah, here's the audio.  Judicial Watch, a government watchdog group, sued for the video to try to quiet conspiracy  theorists who have questioned the Pentagon attack.  The photos show no cabin, no engines, and no tail.  The theorists have talked of a cruise missile or a drone hitting the building, of a government  cover-up of the true origins of the 9-11 attacks.  They say the new video does not put their questions to rest.  Why did it take four and a half years to release more ambiguous frames that still do not prove 
[00:42:30]  the government's case definitively?  Some family members of those who died here at the Pentagon say they are outraged at the  conspiracy theorists.  And Judicial Watch says anyone who doesn't believe that American Airlines Flight 77 slammed  into this building is, in its words, crazy.  Lisa Stark, ABC News, the Pentagon.  Harsh talk like that.  Crazy.  I don't know why they're... 
[00:43:00]  They shouldn't even have acknowledged the conspiracy theorists in those reports.  When they said they released this to quell the conspiracy theorists, they shouldn't give  them the time of day, never mind release things to quell them.  Just say you're releasing it because we got sued and we're releasing it.  Freedom of information.  Why should they have to be sued, though, to release that?  Because it's not like there was a security...  I mean, a security breach, obviously.  But there's nothing you got from that that made matters any worse or better.  They said it was because of the trial. 
[00:43:30]  But why in 2000, didn't they?  That's what I'm saying.  Like 2001.  Right.  Right.  Before Moussaoui's trial.  And they're lying anyway to say that.  I don't believe...  I know.  They said because it might prejudice a jury to see a little more of it.  It humanizes a little more.  It's one of those things.  Did they show it at the trial?  I gather they did.  I was excited to see the footage this morning and...  It shows nothing.  You're like...  It's not like they have high-speed cameras out there.  It's like, come on, help us out.  Catching it in slow motion, though, you know?  Doesn't the Pentagon have security cameras? 
[00:44:00]  I mean, it's the Pentagon.  It's not exactly, you know, the Trade Center.  That's it.  By the fluke, somebody caught the first one.  Two times it was filmed.  It was so out of the realm of possibility that a plane doing five bills is going to smash into the building  that the security cameras they have, you know, it's not like a guy running toward the building  is going to, you know, be seen in one frame and then in the building in another  because he's running 500 miles an hour.  They need better cameras there.  I'm sure they have them now. 
[00:44:30]  That takes a little more than two frames a second.  But the Pentagon has always been, especially a military building like this,  has always been subject to some sort of an attack.  There's no way that there's not...  A regular video camera catches that.  Yeah, 30 frames.  There's no reason.  I guarantee that that's on tape somewhere.  And I believe it was the flight that they said it was.  I just hate the fact that they feel this need to protect us.  We saw that there's nothing you're ever going to see in your life worse than watching The Towers.  Nothing.  That didn't make matters any worse.  It's just annoying that they did it.  For some reason, I think they believe that it's some type of security issue 
[00:45:00]  where that if they show how it was attacked and pulled off successfully,  you don't want that information out there.  That's all I...  It just really annoys me.  That's all I can figure.  They seem to like to have something that they don't tell you,  even when it doesn't prove anything either way.  Yeah.  You know what I liked?  And I call them the good old days.  This country was at its most secure when most of the people didn't know a lot of the shenanigans 
[00:45:30]  that were going on, talking, you know, right post-war, all the way up till the 70s,  around there, the end of communism in the Soviet Union.  We kind of were...  There were a lot of sneaky stuff going on that the American people didn't know about,  but, you know, they felt it necessary to keep us safe.  I don't think we have any less freedoms now than we did then, to tell you the truth.  I just think it's more open now.  You don't think they were tapping into phone lines back then, 
[00:46:00]  checking out people that really...  There was no reason to check them out?  That was happening back then.  Well, yeah, they did some...  To play devil's advocate, they did some bad stuff back then with, you know,  with going after Hollywood people because of the politics.  I mean, they did use it for dirty reasons, too.  I mean, I don't want them to have that much time.  But as far as intelligence goes, we knew what was going on with the Soviets for the most part.  Now, eh, what do you do?  You don't know.  I want one person to call and explain to me why those few frames, 
[00:46:30]  which are unpleasant to look at, but why were they not released  when you've seen the most abominable video you're ever going to see?  You won't get a good answer.  No one can.  It's just the way the government works.  They say, we have a reason, and that's good enough for you.  You can't have to be sued in the country to see that?  Good enough for you.  Let's go to Boston before we take a break.  Eli, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  Hey.  Eli.  Listen, I'm really glad that you guys are bringing stuff back to the show like, wow,  but when are we going to hear, like, the 6 o'clock queef or something like that? 
[00:47:00]  Hmm.  I don't know.  We can work on that.  Yeah.  Sounds good.  And as far as that two frames per second thing,  that's the only thing we're going to get from them anyways.  We haven't seen anything else.  What's that?  Eli.  And an explanation for it?  Hey, Norton.  Eli.  You're an ass.  What did he say?  I would have never gone to your phone call for what you just said.  I'm not done yet.  What did you say?  No, you're done.  Okay. 
[00:47:30]  Stick to what you wanted to talk about.  Eli stinks.  You just said everything we just said.  That's why people go through phone calls, so we don't get calls like that.  All right.  I'm sorry.  What I wanted to talk about was some of the old stuff that you guys used to do.  No, that's not it either.  Goodbye, Eli.  Okay.  Goodbye.  We had a quick little bit that you were going to help us set up, but instead you decided  to talk about five other things.  Five other things that we were done with.  It's not even worth bringing up now. 
[00:48:00]  No.  We're punishing everybody because of Eli.  That's right.  If you tell Travis you're going to talk about something, then you get on the air, talk about  that.  That's the only reason we want you on.  Because now Travis has to be fired.  Again.  All right.  Let's step aside.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Now we all know that Opie and Anthony Wow Stickers are your tickets to a successful Whip-Em-Out  Wednesday.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that Wow Stickers have many other uses?  I built my entire house out of Wow Stickers and two-by-fours. 
[00:48:30]  Solid as a rock.  Oh, crap.  I'm not insured.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings six to nine.  Orange, Jimmy.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  By the way, if you're looking for an Opie and Anthony t-shirt, my brother's working on  the brand new Wow t-shirts because we're trying to bring Wow back.  Yeah.

Before we get to Brother Joe, we got the pit bull story you heard on the way in today.  Yeah.  Cute little story about a couple of little pit bulls.  Anything good ever happen with those dogs when they're raised in an environment where  they're just trained to kill or maybe protect people's drug stash and then they'll let to 
[00:49:30]  wander the neighborhood?  It's a great dog to have, though, because if you're a pet owner, everybody wants to pet  your stupid dog.  No one wants to pet a pit bull.  No.  You're left alone.  But is it really...  It's not really an animal that you own around people that want to pet it.  You own it to protect your drugs or your gun stash or your crack house. 
[00:50:00]  You make a great point, because I live on the Upper West Side, and it's dog owners all  over the ball field.  I hate all of them.  And what are they?  What kind of dogs?  Oh, the tiny little yip-yip dogs.  Little yip-dog.  Little old ladies with plastic bags over their hands picking up after their dogs.  Hybrid yip-yip dogs.  Because they got dog allergies.  So if you take this dog and have it fuck this dog... 
[00:50:30]  Oh, hey, watch the language.  I believe you should say, if you have this dog and mate it with this dog, you get a dog  that doesn't make you sneeze.  It's wonderful.  This dog doesn't have the dander coming off of it.  The dander that I was so allergic to.  Right.  Shut up, translucent skin.  We need someone in my neighborhood with a pit bull just walking around the neighborhood 
[00:51:00]  scaring the crap out of the yip-yip dogs.  Yeah.  And their stupid owners.  Just biting the ears off the naughty children.  With that hand with the plastic bag.  You would have to put...  I couldn't do it.  I would get the ticket.  Just give me the ticket.  What's a ticket for having your dog go on the sidewalk in New York City?  I know it's a lot of money.  It's $10,000.  It could be a couple of dollars more than that, Jim.  I think it's only a couple hundred dollars, to be honest.  Is it?  Yeah.  That's worth it, then. 
[00:51:30]  I'm sure one of the cops will call in and let us know, but...  Because to put that plastic sandwich bag over your hand, walk around, let your little  thing go, and then to pick it up...  Mm-hmm.  I don't care that you got plastic over your hand.  You're still feeling the consistency, the heat, you know, that whole ick, and it skeeves  me out.  Yeah, I'm not into that at all.  Skeeve.  And then they dress up their dogs.  They treat their dogs better than their own kids and other people.  Little booties. 
[00:52:00]  And little sweaters.  Sweaters in the wintertime.  Sweaters?  How about little coats?  Coats.  They got coats now for the dogs with hoods on them.  Do you know dogs have been fine for millennia?  They've been fine just cruising around with their own fur.  They own fur.  Here we go.  Johnny Rock.  Very pissed off.  He's in Queens.  Johnny Rock, go.  Good morning, faggots.  How are you?  How you doing?  We're doing great.  Johnny Rock cakes. 
[00:52:30]  Listen, I've had a pit bull for years.  Yeah.  I've trained dogs since I was a kid.  You can't blame this dog.  I mean, look, I bring my dog to work with me every single day.  Yeah.  And this dog, I had to get an alarm because the dog will not guard my truck.  Okay?  And every pit bull owner I've ever met will tell you the same thing.  They're terrible when it comes to guard dogs.  That's why you never see a pit bull as a professional guard dog like you do a Rottweiler or a German  shopper.  Or maybe because they're a little harder to control. 
[00:53:00]  I mean, they're good dogs, but when they get really mad and they lock down, it's kind of  hard to do anything.  Any dog is fine as long as it's well-trained.  That's what I'm saying.  Pit bulls, though, and Rotties and dogs like that, if they're not well-trained, they're dangerous.  It's like if you have a, what the hell are those little dogs, a terrier, one of those  chihuahua, let's say then.  Thank you. 
[00:53:30]  If you have a chihuahua that's not well-trained and it goes berserk, really, what's it going  to do?  You know, just one kick.  Just one kick takes care of the situation.  That thing is flying.  Those are dogs, though, that if they're not trained well, just like a German Shepherd or  a Pinscher or any of that, if they're not trained well, they can be quite deadly.  They've just become popular with people that don't train their animals.  They train them to kill.  By the way, a $50 to $250 ticket. 
[00:54:00]  Is that it?  That's about it.  We got a guy who's a pit bull advocate.  Me a bag of shells.  Big John.  Me a bag of duty.  Hello?  Big John.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Thanks for taking my call.  Hello.  Did we have a choice?  Real quick.  The last call, I took some of my thunder away.  Listen, about the pit bulls.  I own one for a while.  What's his name?  My girl's name?  Yeah.  Yeah, Cesar.  Of course it is.  Cesar.  Something powerful.  Of course.  And the thing is, real quick.  It's snuggled.  It's got creamy stuff on its back like a salad. 
[00:54:30]  If I may, these dogs were not made to, like I said, the guy said a lot of my stuff.  It wasn't made to be people aggressive or guard dogs.  They weren't made for that.  These dogs, believe it or not, are family dogs.  But a certain group of people ruin these type of dogs.  What kind of people are those?  Well, I'm not going to get into this.  No kidding.  That's what I'm talking about.  Every person in America is scared of pit bulls.  That had to start from somewhere.  Yeah, it had to come from somewhere.  I don't know how many people are scared of the old poodle.  Right.  Or the old chihuahua. 
[00:55:00]  If I may, Cocker Spaniels, Chows, and German Shepherds have more dog bite instances than  the pit bulls and the robs.  Yeah, but they are what you call nips.  Oh, look out.  Be careful.  He nips.  Yeah, but you guys got the wrong impression with these dogs because, you know, every time  a pit bull or a robs or a robs or a bite somebody, it's in the news.  Any other mixed breed or any other dog very rarely makes the news.  Yeah, but you're not understanding what I'm saying.  When a Cocker Spaniel bites you, you go to the medicine cabinet. 
[00:55:30]  A Cocker could do a lot more damage by all means.  Yeah.  They weren't bred to be people aggressive.  A hundred years ago, when it was legal to fight these dogs, you guys don't know this,  when a dog used to bite the owner in the heat of battle...  I know this.  I used to participate a hundred years ago.  Wait, wait, wait.  They would put the dog down and it would bite the owner in the heat of battle.  Right.  I said that earlier.  They were not to do that.  No, but I said...  We do know that because I said that earlier and I was having an argument with a guy who was  a dog advocate and he said that they had to change those laws because to talk about them  is extremely boring. 
[00:56:00]  Believe me, these dogs are great dogs.  They're killers.  Have them all put down.  That's right, sir.  They're hurting our children.  All right, Big John.  There's an earless child running around.  Those two little iPod buds that are going to collect dust for the rest of its young life.  Let's go to Dan in Westchester.  He has a different story.  His glass is just spinning off his nose.  Contacts are nothing.  Dan, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey, yes, sir.  I had a little pit bull.  Name was Socks.  Socks in the box.  Aw.  The dog, you know. 
[00:56:30]  Big fucking head on.  Hey, hey, hey, sir.  Sir.  Sir.  Ah, you curse.  Sir.  If we can, uh...  Hold it.  Penalty.  Cursing.  I bring it to my father's house, right?  And he has a chow-chow tied up.  Chow-chow's a little bit nasty, you know?  The pit bull's over there.  I come out.  The dog's just fighting.  The pit bull grabs onto the chow's neck and just goes limp.  And the chow's like flopping around.  This thing is laying there.  I'm like, holy crap.  I grab it. 
[00:57:00]  I'm punching the crap out of this dog.  I will not let go.  Finally, I mean, I'm just beating it.  I take the chain.  I wrap it around the thing's neck.  I put one foot on it, and I'm pulling it.  And eventually, its eyes open up real bright.  It kind of looks over at me, and it lets go.  I go, all right, all right.  So I pick the dog up.  It's like limp.  I throw it in my truck.  I go back and check on the chow-chow.  It was all right.  He had a lot of hair.  So I walk back over to the truck, and there's the pit sitting in there, all happy, wagging  his tail.  Didn't even know he was being vicious. 
[00:57:30]  I'm going to shoot you.  Right.  I ain't having that dog around my house.  That's a dangerous animal.  All right, everyone's trying to defend the pit bulls.  We're just scared of them.  Yeah.  It comes down to this.  We're scared of them.  They're the devil's dog.  We got the audio of the 1010 win story.  You want to set this up again, Anthony?  Yes, a pit bull attacked some children.  One child lost his ears, which I know is hysterical.  It's only hysterical because the poor little guy is grabbing one, and then the dog says,  roll over, and he does. 
[00:58:00]  Cover the other one, stupid.  He lost his ears, and they went to interview the owner of the pit bull, and he, I don't  think, wanted to be interviewed.  It sounds a little angry.  The owner's showing little remorse after his two pit bulls viciously attacked five school  kids getting off a bus and a man who tried to help them.  Can I just talk to you briefly?  Can I talk to you briefly about-  Get the f*** out of here!  Get the f*** out of here! 
[00:58:30]  Get out of here!  Get the f*** out of here!  Just want to find-  Did you have anything to say, sir?  I'm just asking him a question.  Witness Doug Bedolf said to the children, we're screaming.  The dogs started going into the street.  The traffic stopped.  The kids were running all directions just trying to get away, and another guy stopped his truck.  He got bit up.  They were bit on their hands, legs, and backs.  Police immediately ground one dog, but the other ran off.  Neighbor Lori Crilley. 
[00:59:00]  The parents of these dogs should be prosecuted.  You have these dogs, you know you have them.  Take care of your animals.  Steve Sandberg, 1010 Wins, in the Avonel section of Woodbridge.  There you go.  By the way, we have that clip unedited.  We'll play it later on XM Satellite Radio.  Unedited?  Yeah, Danny found it.  But that's the clean version, because 1010 Wins had the story this morning.  Well, look, we get news reports that come in all the time.  Paul McCartney, Heather Mills, separating. 
[00:59:30]  Why?  That's it.  It says, one thing says, Paul McCartney back on market for a whole woman.  This is a real story.  Get the AP story.  Apparently, it's on CNN Showbiz.  And now, he's going to have to give her how much money?  His kids, every time someone that rich gets married, your kids must want to strangle you.  Yeah.  There goes the inheritance.  Be bleeding it.  How many millions is she going to get for throwing her leg open for, what, a year?  You mean Paul McCartney was married to a girl with a wooden leg and he broke it off? 
[01:00:00]  Sit down.  Thank you, Kenny.  He broke it off.  Thank you.  Oh, that's great.  I don't know if she had a wooden leg or just one of those stupid Lieutenant Dan silver ones  that just tapped with her cane when she showed up at the party.  The magic leg.  Wow.  Yeah, she's going to do quite well for herself, I'm sure.  How long were they together?  And they had a kid, right?  Did they?  Oh, no, no, no.  They lost a kid, right?  Oh, jeez, that's right. 
[01:00:30]  Wait, did they end up having one or not?  I believe she recently miscarried.  Well, lost a kid, saved $50 million, however you want to say it.  She did recently miscarry.  Yeah, they did try, though, right?  Although, the delivery's got to be difficult with a girl with one leg.  You've got to have two doctors, one guard on the unprotected side so it doesn't just fly off to the left.  You need a duck there.  You don't want a slider.  The sheet's like...  It's like coming out of a broken log flume.  It would be dangerous. 
[01:01:00]  Hey, Brother Joe's here, and the Paul McCartney story's hitting as we speak.  We've got to play Lady McCartney.  Ah.  You got the actual story in front of you, though?  Yeah.  Can we screen that and make sure there's no naughty language?  I think it's all right.  I think it's set to go.  Representatives of the couple declined to comment, but said in a statement expected later in the day,  former Beatle Paul McCartney and his wife Heather Mills planning to separate after four years of marriage.  McCartney, 63, and anti-landmines campaigner Mills, 38. 
[01:01:30]  Gee, I wonder why she's an anti-landmine campaigner.  I think that explains a lot.  That really does explain a lot.  If you had one eye, wouldn't you be an anti-throwing pencil campaigner?  Hopscotch advocate Mills.  Yeah.  And the Liverpool-born musician and songwriter made his name in the Beatles. 
[01:02:00]  They actually have to explain who Paul McCartney is.  Who is he alongside?  Wait, John Lennon, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison.  This is groundbreaking news.  Penning classics such as Yesterday, Hey Jude, and The Long and Winding Road.  Someone is actually saying, Oh, that's who that is.  Oh, Paul McCartney.  Jackasses in the news.  It's just awful.  He married Mills, a former model, who had her left leg amputated below the knee after she was hit by a motorcycle in 93. 
[01:02:30]  In a lavish ceremony at an Irish castle.  The way that's written sounds like she had her leg removed in a lavish ceremony at an Irish castle.  Well, shouldn't she be an anti-motorcycle advocate?  Or how about a pro look both ways?  Stop just traipsing out into the middle of the street.  McCartney's second marriage is widely reported to have caused friction with his children. 
[01:03:00]  Of course.  To Eastman, who include fashion designer daughter Stella.  So, yeah, every time he gets married.  Millions!  Millions.  Right out the window.  Bill from Waterford on the Instant Feedback.  Heather Mills won't win any money from Paul McCartney.  She doesn't have a leg to stand on.  So, the jokes have begun.  We kind of knew that was coming.  I don't think it could help.  Oh, here you go.  McCartney and Mills had a daughter October 2003.  They did. 
[01:03:30]  Thank you, Ben.  God, how annoying for the other kids.  With that...  63 and he just can't stop.  Oh.  She probably wanted one.  She wanted a Beatle kid.  I don't blame her.  Who wouldn't want a Beatle kid?  Absolutely.  Comes out with that little haircut, huh?  I'd hold my mother down.  Not even for a Beatle kid.  Just from the black bassist from The Stone.  The guy who they never show.  The drummer that played all the drum tracks on all the albums that Ringo didn't play on.  Please excuse me. 
[01:04:00]  Hold on.  You know what I've come to learn?  I can't look at Jimmy when I'm trying to get a joke out.  Why?  Because you smile.  You put this smirk on like, screw this up, idiot.  He does make it tough because he just wants you to screw up.  He wants it so badly.  He doesn't want you to get a really good laugh.  That's not true.  And the second he gets a hint of it, the second he gets a hint of it, it's like a shark with  a little bit of blood.  The smile goes all the way up.  His snout starts going around.  His eyes roll back white.  There's nothing funnier than somebody flubbing a joke miserably. 
[01:04:30]  Of course.  Of course.  All right.  Here we go.  Brother Joe in studio.  We'll go to break with Lady McCartney.  The abuse has just begun on this story.  I think this one has legs.  Hey, there you go.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Lady McCartney used to have two feet. 
[01:05:00]  Plain to see your lower half's incomes lead.  Saved lots of money.  Got a great excuse.  Can't have price on pedicures, boots and shoes.  Every night she takes off our prosthetics.  Hops in circles when she tries to run.  Yes, she only has to tie one shoelace.  She has a stuff. 
[01:05:30]  Lady McCartney always has a pet.  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  She has a stuff.  Lady McCartney, outside on the street.  She has a stuff.  Lady McCartney, outside on the street.  She has a stuff.  Lady McCartney, outside on the deck. 
[01:06:00]  Get the rapist from a chewing on your leg.  Tuesday afternoon, she's looking sexy.  Then I lift her skirt and see that stump. 
[01:06:30]  Close my eyes and fantasize while everything.  She has a stuff.  Lady McCartney, or should I say Eileen?  How you gonna curtsy when you meet the queen?  I will do you whip him out Wednesday. 
[01:07:00]  Opie and Anthony mornings.  It's whip him out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  Make sure you get your wow stickers.  Go to the website of the radio station you're listening to,  and I think they have ways how you can get wow stickers in your hands.  Get them on your cars.  There are ladies out there that will flash you when they see the wow stickers.  A much nicer day in the Northeast.  That's right. 
[01:07:30]  I was ready to hang myself.  An awful, awful week.  Gloomy.  Wes in Michigan, you're next.  What's up?  Hey, man.  Hey.  I was watching Fox and Friends when they got the Stanley Cup on there.  I just thought they'd sell you.  Fox and Friends has the Stanley Cup?  Now, yesterday, Imus had the Stanley Cup.  I don't think the guy's ever watched a hockey game in his life.  And now Fox and Friends, that hacky morning show, has it?  Yeah, they just advertised it a couple minutes ago.  It'll probably be on in a couple minutes. 
[01:08:00]  Bring me the Stanley Cup!  What is this deal you're bringing me here?  What is this?  Stanley Cup, Mr. Imus.  Yeah, what is that?  Yeah.  It's a championship trophy for the NHL?  Yeah.  Well, that's real important.  Sorry, man.  That's okay.  Maybe they're only bringing it to a TV outlet.  You're just talking over me.  Yeah.  All right.  I know.  Wes, thanks.  You guys rock.  By the way, we rock and you don't.  Trying to do my dead-on fantastic, very popular Imus in the morning impression. 
[01:08:30]  And he's just yapping over me.  It's all right.  I asked Joel Hollander for the Stanley Cup.  Yes, you did.  I got a 10-inch model of the Stanley Cup that was plastic.  Thanks, Joel.  I just say you should wait until we hear a little longer before you start dissing the  gifts of upper, upper, upper management.  I have the balls to say it.  You saw the stupid thing. 
[01:09:00]  It's not balls.  It was like, ugh.  That's like saying you have the balls to do the St. Pat's thing.  And then there was between balls and stupidity.  There was a 10-inch Stanley Cup replica with the Devil's logo on it.  Everyone knows I'm an Islander fan.  And then it's signed by a Devil.  Who cares?  I don't like the New Jersey Devils.  And then there's a note from Joel Hollander with some Mark Messier quote that's not even  right.  Do you know he thought about it?  How about this?  You bring the real Stanley Cup here and you get me a Mark Messier autograph.  Oh, now there's a Mark Messier autograph? 
[01:09:30]  Some quote from Mark Messier that he never said.  Do you understand that there was thought involved?  That he actually thought about us and the show when he got the plastic Stanley Cup?  Well, there was no thought in my head when I threw it in the garbage.  Obviously, no thought in your head.  I like to keep this gig for a while.  It's kind of fun.  No thought whatsoever.  So, Brother Joe in studio.  Hey, Brother Joe.  What's up, buddy?  How he is?  I was going to say, I was waiting for you to admit that you smashed that trophy. 
[01:10:00]  He didn't smash it.  I think he threw it in the garbage, but it's just as bad.  Why is it just as bad?  It's just as bad.  Because it's Joel Hollander.  So?  I don't acknowledge crappy gifts.  He gave us a thought.  It's the thought.  And what sucks is people don't like sending me gifts anymore.  See what I did to myself?  But I do accept nice gifts.  And I'm not one of those, it's the thought that counts, guys, because I really don't care. 
[01:10:30]  There it is, by the way, on Fox and Friends.  There it is!  Give me the Stanley Cup!  They're all touching it and mucking it up.  Laughing with it, having fun.  Laughing, having fun.  Bonding with it, photos taken.  It just looks like a fun, amazing day for anyone who likes hockey.  Look, the chick on the show is using it like she's getting a mammography done.  A mammogram.  And she doesn't like hockey, but she's just getting to touch it.  All that history and fun.  People don't even appreciate it.  Who brought it in?  Who's that guy?  The Stanley Cup.  They assign a guy every year to do that. 
[01:11:00]  He's like some old codger.  Jesus.  Could they get a younger guy?  Who is he, Stanley?  Oh, there's Paul and Heather.  Oh, she is ugly.  I didn't realize how ugly she was.  Maybe he went to rehab and came out and went, she has a horse face.  They look like two old ladies.  Yeah, Paul is kind of looking like an old lady.  Probably 63.  And you know, by the way, any problems in that relationship are her fault.  Anything.  She's some stupid model that didn't even know, meant you should stop. 
[01:11:30]  He's one of the Beatles.  Shut your mouth, swallow, and be happy you married him.  He's gotten to the point, though.  You've got to stop dying your hair.  I understand a little touch-up here and there.  No problem.  But when you get up into, like, the Paul McCartney age, you've just got to stop.  Did he?  He's got to be dying that hair.  Oh, it's still, uh, I didn't even know it was in that picture.  Looks like an old lady that just came back from the parlor.  It's jet black.  When you have that many wrinkles, you shouldn't have jet black hair.  Right.  No, there's got to be a little gray, at least in the temples. 
[01:12:00]  A gentlemanly touch of gray.  Yeah.  All right.  Brother Joe, what did it bring us today?  Oh, I have all kinds of good stuff from TributeCity.com.  Yeah, we should explain this to the new listeners.  Joe's in a tribute band.  Me and Joe were in bands for years and years and years.  You know, everybody that's in a band now has the same dream that you're going to be a goddamn rock star.  You're going to write your own music, you're going to play it somewhere, someone's going  to see it, you are going to end up a rock star, rock in the world, man, and you know  what happens?  Nothing.  For 99.9999% of the people, nothing happens. 
[01:12:30]  You need luck, you need some talent, you need that, you know, the talent's the least of  it.  You just need a lot of luck, you need connections, blah, blah, blah.  So I got the offer to do radio by my good friend Opie and left the band to do radio.  And Joe went on with some other projects and stuff, mostly cover stuff, and then ended  up doing TributeCity.  I got asked once and for all, am I considered the Yoko Ono of Rod Gut? 
[01:13:00]  You were.  At one point?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you still are, I think, with Rex.  Rex Sabasco, our guitar player.  Although not really, because Yoko Ono didn't do much as far as getting, you know, getting  the Beatles to do it anymore.  Ah, thanks, Joe.  And you did, I mean.  No, you did.  I mean.  This part of the show is very fast.  Yoko.  Yeah, this isn't XM.  You got to talk faster.  You actually got to get to a point.  You actually got to get to a point pretty quickly on this part of the show, because we  don't break every two seconds. 
[01:13:30]  All I'm saying is after Anthony got involved with radio, you started getting us gigs.  I mean, we got bigger gigs at that point.  We were getting bigger.  And then Joe went on to a tribute band, where he does a U2 tribute band.  NotU2.com, yes.  Yes, NotU2.com.  And it's a great, great version of U2.  I mean.  It's unbelievable.  You watch it, and it's one of those really cool things.  Okay, see us over at BB King's.  I've seen 2U many times, because I love U2.  I went to the garden show for U2, and then I went to BB King's, right? 
[01:14:00]  And you guys kind of had an after party, and then they played a lot of the U2 songs that  U2 doesn't, they just don't have time to play anymore.  I was in heaven.  I was like a fan in the front row, like cheering these guys on.  I never do that.  They do the impersonation.  If you close your eyes, you think it was the real people.  I'm taking a kiss and bottom over here.  That surprised the hell out of me.  You stayed for the whole show.  The whole show.  I was so into it.  What's the website again?  NotU2.com.  Yeah, and there's plenty of tribute bands.  I mean, you go to some of these websites, and it is really, it goes from you're amazed 
[01:14:30]  at the talent and authenticity of some of these bands, and then you go to the other end of  the spectrum where you are completely horrified and laughing your ass off at the shameful attempt  that some bands make at being these other bands.  Some of them are amusing.  I try getting into some of the finer points of what makes a good and a bad tribute band.  There are some of them that just don't have the vocals, period.  The music's great vocals.  Yeah, so now you listen to the intro, you know, you hear the band start, and the band 
[01:15:00]  is right on the money, so it sounds just like the band, and then the singer pops in, and  eee, ooh, it's just awful.  It works vice versa, too.  So we got some examples here?  Yes.  You want to go to track one?  Track one, just play it?  Yeah, go ahead.  All right.  This is a band called Abba Dabba Doo.  It's an Abba tribute.  And the names, okay, the names kill me.  Who comes up with Abba Dabba Doo? 
[01:15:30]  Some limeys.  It's over, they're from London, England.  Ah.  Abba Dabba Doo, Dancing Queen.  Are they any good?  Actually, yeah, they're pretty good, but the second track, well, they're better.  Abba World Revival, they're from Prague, Czech Republic.  And they're, yeah, a lot of these guys are from, a lot of these bands are from Europe.  Oh, yeah.  And they don't even know what they're singing.  They just kind of know the sound of the words.  Well, you'll hear the intro.  The woman doing the intro, she's just complete, I mean, she sounds hysterical. 
[01:16:00]  That's the second track?  Yeah, that's the second track.  Try the first one.  And to answer your question, are they good?  No.  Even if they sound like Abba, they stink.  You didn't like Abba?  Jimmy, there are 22 Abba tributes worldwide.  Jesus.  Wow.  22.  It's a band that should be shot.  And you know you have this on your iPod.  I do.  Dancing, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Young and sweet, only 17. 
[01:16:30]  All right, you know, for Abba.  I just like her.  It's pretty, you know, good, but it's Abba.  Exactly.  Feel the beat.  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  Feel the beat.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Has anyone ever had this come on the radio and left it on?  I want an honest, honest.  This song is only 40 seconds long.  Nobody knows that.  Because everyone turns it off so fast.  Nobody realizes.  You know.  But that's actually the entire song.  I want to know, have you ever left that song on on your radio? 
[01:17:00]  No.  Not to my knowledge.  Anyone?  I don't remember.  I'll fess up to it.  I have left that on.  Our good friend Joe Curry was a huge Ava fan.  Faggot.  Faggot.  Okay, terrific.  Not that I like it.  It's just some songs you don't necessarily like the song, but it conjures up a nostalgic  time.  Why didn't you turn it off?  Did you have a hog in each hand?  So you want to hear the second one here?  Yeah, throw the second one on this.  All right.  A little taste of the second. 
[01:17:30]  This is Ava World Revival from the Czech Republic.  A little bigger.  From the Czech Republic.  Yeah, this is a 10-piece band.  They should be oppressed.  It's a 10-piece band.  They're just playing because hopefully they can eat that night.  Poverty-stricken idiots.  Now they don't know what they're saying?  Closer to it.  Well, the original Ava was just kind of, they didn't speak English very well, did they? 
[01:18:00]  No.  They were from Sweden.  Go just to see what she speaks like.  Go to track four, Waterloo, and it's live.  Uh-oh.  I can't understand a word she's saying. 
[01:18:30]  All right.  Get to some rockin'.  Get to some rockin' bands.  Real stuff.  I know, man.  This is gay.  First, you're Ava.  No homo.  We're just moving a little bit away from the gay realm with some Billy Joel track five.  Sorry, Jim.  What is the name of this guy?  What does this guy go as?  This guy's going to bite my face.  What?  It's Big Shot.  This is Big Shot.  Oh, the band is called Big Shot, right?  From Long Island.  Mike DelJudis.  This is live at the downtown. 
[01:19:00]  That's not bad.  That's not bad.  These guys have been around for years.  How many Billy Joel bands out there?  There are...  There are...  I actually have a number on it.  Billy Joel.  There are 15 Billy Joel tributes.  Do we really need 15?  That guy's pretty good.  Worldwide, though.  Now, I thought... 
[01:19:30]  My favorite is the Neil Diamond ones, though.  Actually, he was the best for a long time.  And then trolling around online on Tribute City, I found a band called Christie's X.  They're from Nashville, Tennessee.  Nashville.  Track six.  Try track six.  Don't ask me why.  This is those guys.  Christie's X.  The music is good.  Yeah, the vocals are real good, too.  The guy, I think, is a little better than mine. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He does a good young Billy Joel, yeah.  Does he look like him?  Because that's part of a tribute band.  You've got to look like the guy.  He does.  He really does.  Does he look like the old Billy...  The old bald Billy Joel.  Oh, no, the old one?  No, the old Billy Joel.  The old where it looks like Don Rickles singing Billy Joel? 
[01:20:30]  What happened, Billy?  I don't know.  Jesus.  Him and Paul Simon.  That big beard to look like Sanny, man.  It's like Santa Claus.  Hey, really fast, by the way.  Chris Evil Carmen from Boston.  Hey, Ann, I have to fess up.  I've scanned the radio dial, and Dancing Queen was on two different stations five minutes apart,  and I had to listen to it each time in its entirety.  I'm such a faggot.  Give me some Johnny Cakes.  It's Johnny.  I love you, Johnny Cakes. 
[01:21:00]  There's just something nostalgic about some of the songs, and, you know, they call them guilty pleasures.  And then Vinny from the Bronx.  Want to talk about Faggy?  I have the cast recording of Mamma Mia on my iPod, not even the real ABBA.  All right.  Now that's bad.  Yeah.  It's something I would never, ever go to.  And then Awful Me from one of the fan sites that we can't mention still.  So join our MySpace account, Opie and Anthony, and all the links to our websites are up there.  Awful Me just writes, I want a pit bull to chew my ears off.  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, Pat from Unaki saying you ought to check out a Billy Joel tribute band called Dewey.  He drives into houses.  He wanted to give a quick listen to Piano Mail on 7.  That's...  Here's a great Billy Joel cover tune here.  Uh-oh.  Just that he can play it is pretty good.  Is he colorblind?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh. 
[01:22:00]  What's wrong, Jimmy?  Jimmy got a bad banana.  No, it's not a bad banana.  It's just green.  It's like a dollar bill.  Stupid.  They get yellow.  That's better.  He was looking for a green one.  He thought that meant they were healthier.  You peeled that banana, and I turned quickly to you, because that's a noise that a banana  should not be making when you peel it.  No, absolutely.  It's like cardboard being ripped.  All right.  Here's Piano Mail.  Opening a television.  It's nine o'clock on a Saturday.  Eh.  Regular crowd.  Hey, he stepped in too early.  Not bad.  There's an old man sitting next to me. 
[01:22:30]  Here's the...  I don't like him.  Oh, well.  Yeah, I don't like him.  That was Christy's ex again.  All right.  Some's you do, some's you don't.  You got track eight.  This is a guy by the name of David Brighton from Los Angeles.  He's a David Bowie impersonator, and he's deadly.  He looks exactly like him.  Sound-wise, does he call himself David Blowey?  Does he draw what the Mick Jagger look like?  Actually, he did do...  What the hell is this song?  They're dancing in the streets. 
[01:23:00]  He has a promo video on his site.  Make David Bowie.  There you go.  He's terrible.  Ugh!  That's not bad.  Pretty good.  All right.  Who enjoyed this song?  Who one of you out there?  A lot of people like this.  No one does.  You know how you like...  You love Sabbath.  Some people feel the same way about other bands and people.  That's dance! 
[01:23:30]  Jimmy, if it makes you feel any better...  Should we?  If it makes you feel any better, there are 55 Black Sabbath tributes out in the world.  That does make me happy.  There you go.  With some form of Sab in their name.  Yeah.  Sabra Kadabra.  Sabra Kadabra.  China Girl.  Did you ever hear that song?  My China Girl.  David Bowie is terrible.  Oh, Jimmy, just you shut your mouth.  There's a lot of Bowie fans out there that would disagree, man.  I know they would.  Half dog, half man.  What is he? 
[01:24:00]  No, there are bands that are music intensive.  There's Chicago.  Yeah.  Obviously, you need a big horn section.  That sounds like quite a big undertaking to be a Chicago tribute band.  Tremendous.  They're walking around with a lot of gear.  Just to get 10 people together to play at once.  Saturday in the Park, track number 10 by a band called Beginnings, and they're out of  Huntington, New York.  They're homies, Ant.  Oh, should have them there at F.H. Riley's, my brother's restaurant, 400 New York Avenue  in Huntington Village.  Fit a 10-piece Chicago band in there. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, right.  You'll have one table eating.  All right.  Kind of easy on a piano to sound like the guy.  Exactly.  I figured that was my theme.  No, you can't.  I mean, if you know how to play the piano, it's easy to sound like the band through just  the piano.  But then when the horn's kicking.  The problem.  Oh, yeah.  What, they have one horn guy?  No kidding.  They've got symbols in between his legs.  That should be big.  They can only afford one horn guy.  Don't like the vocals. 
[01:25:00]  How can you?  They're awful.  This is track 10, right?  That was terrible.  Oh.  Okay, now, from Minneapolis, Minnesota, track 11.  And same song Saturday in the park by the Transit Authority.  They're called.  These guys are from Minneapolis.  The Transit Authority.  Of course.  These guys are.  Yeah.  Vocally, they're much better, too.  How come the piano sounds different, yet it still sounds the same?  Production.  It's all in production. 
[01:25:30]  Here's your horns.  That's better.  And the vocals are better?  I'll give it a listen.  Saturday in the park.  It's a little dramatic, but.  Nice.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Why would he do this for a living?  I have a name for him that sounds like Chicago, but we can't say it here.  It starts with an S-H instead of C-H. 
[01:26:00]  But it would sound the same, though, because the C sounds like S-H.  Anyway, so Chicago is spelled S-H.  Skip right over 25 to 624.  Here's possibly the worst Beach Boys tribute I've ever heard.  They're called the Hit the Beach Boys.  And it's track 14, Surf and Safari.  Let's go surfing now.  Everybody's learning how to support me.  There are chicks in this band.  Oh, that's a fart.  And Huntington and Mallory, they're shooting the pier. 
[01:26:30]  And Rick on the walk in the night.  That's good.  That's awful.  Wow.  Come and dance ready to go.  This is horrible.  I like these boys.  Wow.  I'd rather hear Scott Peterson in the Beach Boys, Vance.  The funny thing is, those guys are from Gainesville, Georgia.  Yeah.  And American, obviously.  There's the Brighton Beach Boys from Brighton, England, track 15.  Brighton Beach Boys.  Hey, those are the Brighton Beach Boys. 
[01:27:00]  Bunch of toughs.  Soccer hooligans.  Wouldn't it be nice if we could be out in the morning when the day is due, and at the  heaven's got a big day.  That's not bad.  Let's get to the competition portion of this, Joe, where we have to guess the actual live  band and the cover live band.  Uh-oh.  What?  You don't have that?  You didn't want to hear a tribute to the darkness called the Brightness. 
[01:27:30]  This was the...  The Darkness?  Yeah, this is track 22, Ope.  You just have to give this...  Why is it really bad?  You guys hear that one band, The Floating Seeds?  They do a tribute to Rod Stewart's stomach.  What is this again?  They're called...  You know the band The Darkness?  They had that one song, I believe in a thing called Love.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, these guys call themselves...  Kind of has that queen...  Yeah, they call themselves The Brightness.  Track 22.  It's live, and it's awful. 
[01:28:00]  Come on.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  It gets into the high vocals.  This is good.  I like this.  All right.  By the way, they're from Rome, Italy. 
[01:28:30]  Wait for the high note.  Italian?  Excellent.  Excellent, Jim, right?  They sound just like them.  Wow.  Off.  Off.  Let's just go.  Off.  Let that play.  Let that whole song play through.  That's kind of good.  You can't even recognize the song.  Oh, my God.  Don't be dagos.  So bad.  I wish you'd step aside before we do the contest.  Yes.  Oh, there's a contest.  Oh, there's a contest. 
[01:29:00]  I didn't know about the contest.  We're going to try to guess the cover band or the real band playing live.  I like contests.  We go to break with Brother Joe doing the Guitar Father.  Uh-oh.  Getting a lot of requests for this thing, Brother Joe.  That thing took me about an hour to do.  And it's very, very cool.  Got any Sabbath in there, Joseph?  Not this time, Jim.  This contest stinks.  Let's see.  79 Beatles tributes, 72 ACDC, 66 U2 bands, 61 Led Zeppelin bands. 
[01:29:30]  You're one of 62 U2 bands.  Yeah, but we're the best.  55 Black Sabbath bands, 42 Bon Jovis, 36 Rolling Stones, 27 Elvises, 13 Stevie Ray Vaughans, 15 Journeys, 8 Bee Gees, 5 Bad Companies, 4 Evanescence tributes, 2 Alanis Morissette's, 1 Anthrax, and 1 Aaron Carter tribute.  Ooh.  Wow.  There you go.  That's just some stats.  I don't know this Aaron Carter.  I don't know what he does. 
[01:30:00]  It's Nick Carter's brother.  Nick the Carter the DJ?  No.  I'm dead serious.  Who?  Nick Carter from the Backstreet Boys.  Exactly.  I shouldn't know who that is.  Good for me.  I absolutely shouldn't be a kid.  I do not.  Excellent for me.  Absolutely good for you.  Sorry, the rest of the pole smokers in here are big Nick Carter fans.  But I don't know him.  We've just heard the name over the years.  I don't know him.  Not being a comedian, I have no idea who Nick DiPaolo is.  Sorry.  I didn't call him Nicky Cakes. 
[01:30:30]  Well, Nick DiPaolo is, I mean, Nick is whether you're gay or straight, you would enjoy Nick because  he's pretty vicious.  Yeah.  Nick Carter from the Backstreet Boys.  No, it's just that you know the name because it's been on TV a lot.  My mind won't process that name.  I'm sure I've heard it.  All right.  My mind goes, that's all.  Pulse marker.  That's fine.  It's not like we're listening to Backstreet Boys.  Well, why aren't you?  Not everybody in the room.  All right.  Here's Brother Joe, Guitar Father, as we go to break. 
[01:31:00]  Backstreet Boys. 
[01:31:30]  Backstreet Boys. 
[01:32:00]  Backstreet Boys. 
[01:32:30]  Backstreet Boys.  Backstreet Boys. 
[01:33:00]  guitar solo 
[01:33:30]  I love showing my  introverted fat guys 
[01:34:00]  Whip Em Out Wednesday  Whip Em Out Wednesday  Opie and Anthony  Mornings 6 to 9  Yeah, you're checking out the O&A virus  spreading across America  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday  Hope you have your wows on your cars  We'll get into it a little more as the weeks progress here  A little later in the season  Yeah, we're still waiting for everyone to get their wow stickers 
[01:34:30]  We got Brother Joe in studio  How about those Yankees last night, Jimmy?  How about those Yankees?  Came back from a 9-0 deficit  Good pitching, obviously  Decided to put one over the wall to finish off the game  and the Yankees win  There, Mikey  I wanted to hear the call  I saw it on TV last night  I was at the cellar  and I didn't hear the call  Sometimes John Sterling can do an amazing call  Now, you have not always been kind to John Sterling 
[01:35:00]  I have a love-hate relationship with Sterling  I do think he's great  And I also think that at times  Is it true you call him Johnny Cakes?  I think it's true  Sometimes I call him John Tarnish  Who's this fat slob in that awful bathing suit on TV?  I don't know, it's on the early show  I'm sure she lost a bunch of weight, though  and looks great now  There's a before, but the after should be her dead  She didn't change  No, this is a bathing suit show 
[01:35:30]  Oh, they do this every season  Hey, fat girls  Let me let you in on something  How to make fat girls look thinner in their bathing suit  The bathing suit is not changing a thing  Here's how you do that  Oh, wow  Here's how you do that  The bathing suit  Oh, she turned around  Oh, you never should do that  The bathing suit should come with elephants that stand behind her  That's the only reason  Avoid illusion suits  And cutouts  Yeah, you don't want the thighs cut out of that  She has that cellulite that looks like she's been sitting in the gravel driveway 
[01:36:00]  For a few hours  And then gets up and brushes the gravel off  Well, the challenge with that woman was tummy  That was the challenge?  There was more challenges on that woman  But keeping it full for her  That's the only challenge  How about getting that fat whore a space suit?  There you go, go lay on the beach and tan your fingers  All right, we got the next one  That's before  She's wearing some boy shorts  Yeah, little boy shorts  And some kind of small little sleeveless number  With a colorful floral pattern  Oh, wow 
[01:36:30]  Now she's got to go with the spaghetti strap top  And a little more cleavage showing  Because you've got to show your assets, girls  When you're a big girl  Showing those assets is really what it's all about  She's still got huge thighs  You know what she'd look good in?  A sealed 55-gallon drum alongside the thru wagon  I swear to you  It says avoid boy shorts  Her challenge was being pear-shaped  She has no problem avoiding boy anything  They just stay away from her 
[01:37:00]  Just a bunch of slobs  It really is awful  They try to  How about losing?  Losing the weight  Right  How about that?  All right, getting back to the Yankees  So we've got the John Sterling call  Jimmy has a long-hate relationship with John Sterling  The announcer for the Yankees  I saw this on TV last night  I did not hear the call  If he says Georgie juiced one  I'm breaking equipment in this studio  Okay, batting down the hatches  I have no idea  I haven't heard this call yet  Well, he says a bunch of things  Like when Giambi plasters one over the fence 
[01:37:30]  What does he say?  The Giambino  The Giambino  Yeah, for the rest of the country  Sterling gets a little hokey  He's the guy  If you hear the Yankees win  You know  When the Yankees would win a 1-0 game  And it was intense  And he would go  You know, the Yankees win  The Yankees win  They win 17-4  In Minnesota  On June 8th  And he goes  The Yankees win  Do they?  And the whole thing with every player 
[01:38:00]  Has to have a little name  That he then puts on them  When they do something well  Well, here's the call  The Yankees won last night  14-13  After being down 9-0  Very exciting game  9th inning walk-off home run  It'll be a 3-1 to Posada  Pitch  Swung on and  Hit in the end of the deep right  That ball is high  It is far  It is gone  It is a bottom of the ninth  Two out  Two run  Walk-off home run  For Posada  Georgie 
[01:38:30]  Juice  Why?  It is a two-run home run  To elevate the Yankees  In a 13-12 loss  Georgie  Juiced one  A 13 win  Ball game over  Yankees win  The Yankees win  Georgie  Juiced one  Good old Georgie  Georgie  Juiced one  Why in the middle of that  Do you have to make it about you? 
[01:39:00]  He's so annoyed  It's not about you  No  It's about the game  Oh my god  Why?  Thank god Georgie  Juiced one  Yeah I know  What does that mean  When he went home  He took some oranges  And went  And drank it  Holy  Oh my god  Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me?  Clear the field  Holy  My goodness  Wow  We are staring at 
[01:39:30]  The Stanley Cup  Jimmy goes  What is that?  The greatest trophy  It's the Cupino  Dude the Stanley Cup  Wow  I'm afraid to even  Get close to it  Are you kidding me?  Look at that  That is the Stanley Cup  Opie  See  Ask and you shall receive  Thank you  Wow  Thank you Mark Chernoff  Thank you Joel Harlander  See  You were being  All disrespectful  And what do they do?  They brought in the actual  Ever been this close  To the Stanley Cup? 
[01:40:00]  A long time ago  When the Islanders were winning it  Clark Gillies brought it  To the Huntington Crescent Club  For the day  And we all got  Pictures around it  And that's the same Cup  Dude you're reunited again  Well don't they take  Some of it off  As the years go on  Or something like that?  I'll get this mic on  I got it on  I think it's on  I can actually  Go over here  Yeah you can do that  That's better  Yeah we take the  Top ring off  And it's going to go  Into the Hall of Fame  Move everything up  And put a new ring  On the bottom  It's actually completely  Full right now  So this is the second time  The NHL has taken a ring 
[01:40:30]  Off the Stanley Cup  Yeah they take the top ring off  Like you said  And they throw it  In the Hall of Fame  And then they add a new one  At the bottom  So it's always the same size  I don't think this guy cares  Up here  R Noble  He'll be always on there  That's kind of the neat thing  Oh that one  Which ring gets removed?  I mean we're on radio  But there's five major bands  On the Stanley Cup  The barrel part of the Stanley Cup  Are the rings that interchange  The top half of the cup  The top half of the cup stays the same  Right above the fifth ring  Represents the first 100 years  Going from 1893  Up to 1992  And then some of those bands  You were pointing  Are from the early 20s 
[01:41:00]  And then some of the actual  The first year  Is actually halfway down  And it's 1893  On the bull  It goes from 1903  Up to 1905  And inside the bull  Was the very first time  They ever put players names on it  Which is in 1907  Wow  The history  Right here in the room with us  How cool  I see some smudges  Have people been touching this?  Hey hey  Yeah we  I don't mind people  You guys can touch it  Oh goody  Get your hands off it  That's it 
[01:41:30]  Look I touched the Stanley Cup  Hello  Alright  Opie  You were being  A  Spoiled brat  And you demanded  The Stanley Cup  Come in here  And look at what they did  For you  For us  My name is Mike Bolt  Hey Mike  No I gotta explain  Our boss over here  He gave us a 10 inch replica  That was plastic  And I got kind of bummed down  I threw it in the garbage  And I demanded to see  The actual real thing  And they made it happen  Which is just amazing to me  That is what it's all about 
[01:42:00]  Working here  I'm amazed  So you're a big Islanders fan right?  Absolutely  We're not gonna win this anytime soon  Well did you know  The Islanders is spelled wrong on here?  Where?  Let me show you here  Wow  Did you know that?  I had no idea  I told you  You did not  Kimmy  Shut up  Right there  Oh they forgot the S  They forgot the S  It's New York Islander  I-L-A-N-D-E-R-S  When they won it in 80-81  Who's the dope? 
[01:42:30]  There's a lot of spelling mistakes on here  The Leafs is spelled wrong in 62-63  Boston in 72 is BQSTQN  There's a variety of players  Named from Ted Lindsey  Jacques Plante  Bob Ganey  Has been spelled wrong  And then the two players  That have been corrected on here  Are Adam Debmarsh  From the 96 Avalanche  And Manny Legacy  From the 2002 Red Wings  And look how scratched up it is  When you get close to it  You guys polish it up nice  When it's time to get  You know  Give it away right?  Yeah we  Absolutely  I mean  During the Stanley Cup finals 
[01:43:00]  It'll get an actual  Proper silver polish clean  It's not good to polish it every day  So what I do is  Every day I'll give it a wash  A wipe down  And then buff dry it  I did do that this morning  This is our second stop of the day  Like I said  We do let people touch it  But you can't lift it  You have to earn the right to hoist it  As far as the scratches go  I mean it's 114 years old  What'd you do?  What's that?  What'd you do  To earn the right to hoist it?  I don't hoist it  I hold it  I have to carry it  And pull it out of the box  You never when you're alone  Hold it over your head  I swear on my parents' lives  I got kids of my own  I swear to you  I've never hoisted it 
[01:43:30]  I've never drank it  Wow  You've never been naked alone  Just placing that thing  Over your head  I would hoist it nude  And take photos  That's why you are not  The keeper of the cup  The keeper of the cup  Oh I know  The thing would be a mess  So what part is over 100 years old?  The top third?  Yeah just the bowl itself  Is actually the original part  That's the part that dates back to 1893  Yeah wasn't it just originally?  Just a bowl  Yeah Lord Stanley bought it  For $48.67 back in 1892 
[01:44:00]  And like that could have just been thrown in the garbage at some point  And your whole job is to just do what?  The NHL has me traveling all over the place  Especially this time of year  Promoting the hockey  Doing a variety of charity events  You know during the summer we're obviously with the winning team  We travel with the players now  I mean there are some pretty wild stories that have happened in the past  But we want these guys to have a fun wild time  But safe and respectful time at the same time  Because we want to keep it around for another 100 years  You have to realize I mean guys back in the 70s, 60s, and 50s  Didn't even get two minutes with it 
[01:44:30]  Really?  Some of the wild things that have happened  Maybe in the late 80s, early 90s  That kind of thing  Yeah cocaine coming out of the top  Hey how do you travel with that thing?  Do you actually have to check that at the airport?  It's got a special case that it travels in  We do check it  It does go underneath the plane  Things have changed a little bit obviously  Oh my god  Yeah I mean we used to have a little more control before 9-11  But I mean the airlines are pretty good  I gotta tell you  What do they think something's gonna be stored in that?  You know what?  We have to get it inspected like everything else  And that's fine  We shouldn't get that kind of special treatment  But as long as it gets to the plane and gets to the other end 
[01:45:00]  That's all I'm concerned about  Do you have security or no with you when you travel with that?  It varies from event to event  I mean there are certain people that travel with me  When I'm actually physically getting on a plane by myself  No it's just me on my own  Or maybe one of my colleagues  You know what the most danger it's ever been in  At any given time with a team or a guy?  I heard it ended up at the bottom of a swimming pool once  Mario Lemieux  That is a true story  This is why I have a job today  Oh really?  Yeah Phil Borek actually  It's a well documented story  That it did end up in the bottom of Mario's pool  That's why we gotta keep it out of the pool 
[01:45:30]  It will sink  It's hollow  It's hollow  And chlorine is not very good for it either  No I wouldn't think  Chlorine is not good for silver  And it is made of  Yeah it's 97% silver  3% nickel  Wow  Well there it is Opie  Yeah that is pretty cold  There it is  Look at that results  The greatest trophy in sports right there  In front of us  There's not a better trophy  Name it  Not a more famous one  My father gave me a running award  When I finished the mile race  No one cares  In 8 minutes  Special Olympics Jim 
[01:46:00]  Yeah it was really awful  Wow  I'm stunned that it happened  That we actually have it here in the studio  Yeah now I feel like a complete ass  That never  That would never happen  Like any time  In our radio career  No  We just yell and scream  Knowing that it's not gonna get done  But for once  The yelling and screaming  Got us some results  People are saying  Hey Opie smash it  He's got quite a reputation 
[01:46:30]  Yeah can I kick it just once really hard  No you can't  We kinda need it in a few weeks  Yeah  That is really really cool  What do you think Jimmy  You guys aren't really hockey fans  But are you impressed  I'd like a  Of course  It's the Stanley Cup  I still recognize that I can hawk that  It's like a celebrity for Jim  This thing is  I mean a lot of history in this  Come on  You look at the dates  And the names on there  Jiminy Crickets  I'd like a photo with the Stanley Cup  So I can show girls  They can go  What is that  And they can go  Shut up  We should take a quick break  So we can maybe get our pictures 
[01:47:00]  With the Stanley Cup  That's right  Where are you going after this  Heading over to New Jersey  Do a couple things over there  And then actually after today  I'm heading on to Minnesota  Yeah right on  I was hoping that you could do the walk with us today  With the Stanley Cup  That would be amazing  Let us hoist it  We do this walk thing every day  Where we broadcast it live  We're done here in about 15-20 minutes  Hoist Ben's hog on the way over  And then we broadcast live  As we walk to our other studio  XM Satellite Radio  Which carries all the NHL games 
[01:47:30]  Absolutely  And how cool would it be  To just walk the Stanley Cup over there real fast  In the streets of New York  Well that would be cool  Look he's looking around  Like a  Humming up  Humming up  Humming up  Humming up  Unfortunately  I've got a tight  That would be a great idea  I think it would be really cool to do that  But the schedule is pretty tight  You can leave it with us for a while  And we'll give it back  Promise  Yeah I think I can trust you guys  Hold on  We've got to go to Greg on the phones here  Greg what's going on man  Yeah how you doing  Hey  I'm keeping track of  You know the companies  That are doing things for Opie and Anthony 
[01:48:00]  Uh huh  Yeah we've got two companies now  That we work for  XM Satellite Radio  And CBS Radio  Yes Greg  Free FM 3  XM 0  What are the three things  That CBS gave us  CBS gave you a new studio  Yep  They gave you advertising  Yep  And now a trophy  Yep  The real trophy  That's actually true  Yes yes  XM  Yeah we'll wait for Eric Logan's response  We'll see what he brings to the table  This is like the  Like I was saying  The divorced parents  We are the parents  Our parents are divorced  And one parent is coming forward now 
[01:48:30]  And their kid  Showing their kid the Stanley Cup  We asked for the Stanley Cup  And XM gave us  Norman Fell's athletic supporter  While telling us to clean our room  Okay  I'm keeping track  Alright thanks for keeping track Greg  Thanks bud  Alright  Let's take a break  Get some pictures  Yeah so  You can get out of here  Anything else you want to add?

[01:49:00]  And I really got to thank  Mark Chernoff and Joel Hollander  For making this happen  I mean this is really  Really cool to me  To check out the Stanley Cup  Like I said  I saw it a little over  20 years ago  When the Islanders  Were winning the Cups  It's the same one  It's the same one  Alright cool  Back again  It's the only virus  Spreading across America  We'll be back in just a bit  Prepare to be wowed  What knockers  Give them out Wednesday  Okay okay fine  Wowed  Opie and Anthony  Mornings  The Stanley Cup 
[01:49:30]  Has completely stopped  The Opie and Anthony  Show today  Even Jimmy's excited now  Right?  Yeah I'm not a hockey fan  But I still recognize  The importance of the trophy  I mean it's a  It's a legendary piece  Of uh  You know  It's a historic  Icon  It's just one of those  Things you look at  And it's been around  For so long  So many people  Have had contact  With it  Presidents  International leaders  You know 
[01:50:00]  The history of the  Players on the thing  You look down  You know  You're looking at  The little names  Engraved on there  Gretzky's last game  You know  Team that he was on  When he won the cup  And all  Just amazing  I gotta go  Down really really low  To see my favorite team  Way way down there  But how cool is that  And I just found out  The Stanley Cup  Will be making the walk today  From here to  XM Satellite Radio  How  How happy are we 
[01:50:30]  To explain to the new listeners  We do two radio shows a day  Basically  The first half  Is also  The entire show  Is heard on XM  I should start there  First half is heard on  Some fine terrestrial radio stations  And then right after  The show ends  At like 8.50 or so  We go down to the lobby  And then we start  Broadcasting live  Exclusively on XM  And we broadcast  The walk every day  From this studio  To the XM studios  And today  How cool is this gonna be  We walk and broadcast  With the Stanley Cup  On the streets of New York 
[01:51:00]  Um  We should ask people  If they can spell  Stanley  Because apparently  Somebody  That works in our  Organization  Cannot  You know we have  Pad data  On XM  When you turn it on  Whatever we're doing  That day  Derek back at the studio  Types it in  And it lets you  It gives you a little  A clue of what  We're talking about  And we're talking about  The Stanley Cup  So he typed it in  S-T-A-N-L-Y  And we're getting 
[01:51:30]  So much instant feedback  Who's the dope  Typing it in  This idiot  Can't even spell  Stanley  So that's Derek  Back at the XM studio  That can't spell  I'm surprised you didn't  Spell it  S-T-A-N  Space L-E-E  Like the Marvel  Comic Book founder  Stanley  You're a retard  R-E-T-A-R-T  Derek  Know what I'm noticing  About this new  Arrangement we have  Anthony  Got something  Yes  This one  Go  Derek is saying 
[01:52:00]  There is no E  To look it up  How come  How about we ask  The guy that travels  With the Stanley Cup  270 plus days a year  Sir  If you would step  Over to the mic  I believe he would  Be the expert  How is Sir Stanley's  And Lord Stanley's  Name spelled  S-T-A-N-L-E-Y  Okay  Derek is  We looked it up  Stupid  There  That's looking it up  Idiot  Look him up  That guy had to  Look up the two  Exactly  He doesn't like E's  He's a 
[01:52:30]  A quirk  You know  What I like  About this new  Arrangement  I gotta say  We don't have to  Yell as much  Around here  To get things done  I know  Not much yelling  At all  A couple days  Tops  Next thing you know  Stanley Cup  The Stanley Cup  Is in our studio  It wasn't even a yelling  It was strong suggestion  It was childlike  Begging and cleaning  Through anger  And people kill me  On the instant feedback  I know I sound  Like an asshole  Yeah  Can I say that  I don't even know  I think you can  In that context 
[01:53:00]  Don't allow that  That's not an FCC violation  Because it's such truth  Just in case  I acknowledge  I sounded like an ass  Asking for the Stanley Cup  I know that  You don't have to  Point that out  Ever  Let's say hi to  Jeremy in Jersey  Jeremy  Hey  Yes  Yeah I just wanted  To see if  He could tell  The best story  About the Stanley Cup  Which is better  Than the Mario Lemieux  The Canadians  Winning the Cup  Getting drunk  All around Montreal  With it  Ending up on a frozen lake  And they all go home  And leave it on a lake 
[01:53:30]  Yeah is it true  That the Stanley Cup  Was left on a frozen lake  After the Canadians won it  I don't know  Silver 7  Drop kicked it  Into the Rideau Canal  In Ottawa  Why would you do something  In 1905  The Montreal Canadiens  Left it on the side  A street corner  In Montreal  The story goes  That they were on their way  To a party  The coach was throwing  They got a flat tire  And to get at the jack  They had to pull the cup out  Change the tire  And they took off  To the party  Without picking up  The Stanley Cup  The Stanley Cup  Was sitting on the street corner  For about three hours  That's really good 
[01:54:00]  How did no one take it  Huh  I mean that's the  That's the amazing part  Yeah  See there you go  How much does that thing weigh  35 pounds  35 pounds  He knows everything about it  He was talking about the rings  And how they're removed  And then how long it takes  For the bottom ring  To move up to the top  And how long is that  Right now the bottom ring  Is going to take 52 years  Before it comes off  The Stanley Cup  So you can have your name  Actually that's the  Shortest amount of time  Is 52  The longest is 65  So whoever wins this year  Will be on the Stanley Cup  For 65 years  Because it'll be the  First team on the new band  Yeah  And Jimmy's throwing some 
[01:54:30]  We're all having a good time  And taking pictures  With the cup  And Jimmy's got to just  Bring his sick depression  Into the whole thing  By going  Do you realize  We'll all be dead  By the time this ring  Gets here  But then I'll point it out  You'll be dead  Before this gets here  And he pointed like  One year in advance  Yeah  Well  You know  Good point Daddy  Thanks for the buzzkill  Yeah  We'll be dead  Well I wasn't trying  To do a buzzkill  I was kind of just pointing out  Like how this 
[01:55:00]  Thanks mister  I'm just trying to look  At the redwood trees  Well  Don't tell me how long  They've been there  When I went to the Grand Canyon  That exact thing  You just want to enjoy  How amazing the damn thing is  And then you get some buzzkill  On the rim  Talking about how long  It took the river  To carve this out  You know a dinosaur  Looked down at this thing  Like you are right now  You know  In our lifetime  It's not even going to  Carve out another inch  Like oh thanks  Thanks  Can I just enjoy the view  Exactly  But I like to know  History like that  You don't want to go  To the Grand Canyon  And go  A hole 
[01:55:30]  You want to know about it  You ever see a big tree  Maybe the redwood  Or something  And they cut it  And you get to see the rings  And then they do history dates  Oh and then you see  Jesus born  Right  Jesus born is in the middle  And then like  Yeah  For trees  Yeah  Well whatever  I mean  Trees are old  Yeah there are some  That are up there  There are some trees  That are very very old  But for each ring  They do the history  What was going on  Like the pilgrims  Came to America  And all this  And you're like  Oh no  Doesn't look good for us  What am I  Then you chop it down  And laugh  Who's got the last 
[01:56:00]  Left now tree  Let's go to Elliot  In New Jersey  Elliot  Hey ONA  Hey boys  Hey  Did Jackie Martling  Ever  Poo in the cup  You know what  Tom Chiasano  Just came in  You know  We probably  Shouldn't bring this up  With the NHL people here  Because they swore  They would never bring  The Stanley Cup  Back to this location  Oh my god  Right  This studio  Here  So Tom Chiasano  Came in and explained  The Jackie the joke man  Thing  And no he did not 
[01:56:30]  Poo in the cup  Okay  It's been rumored  For many many years  He went into the bathroom  With the cup  And a couple tootsie rolls  And a little water  Oh  He made it look  Really really good  But the NHL  Still very very pissed off  And he said  They would never bring  The Stanley Cup  Back to this studio  Tell him Fred  You did  Alright let's say hi to him  We would never do that  To the cup  We will just drop  Audio recordings  Of this program  Into it  Same thing  Tim in Buffalo  What's up  Hey Ope  I was just wondering 
[01:57:00]  If you've jumped  On the Sabres bandwagon  I want the Sabres  To win it all  Yes  They're a New York team  Come on  Yeah I know  I just  I figured  When the Flyers  Were in the playoffs  Still you were  On their bandwagon  Because you guys  Broadcasted there  And unfortunately  No I was  Faking that man  I can't really  Be a Flyers fan  I gotta be honest  With you  I went down there  To see the Islanders  Play the Flyers  And by the time  I got to my seat  About five  Six minutes into the game  It was like five  Nothing Flyers  And I drove all the way 
[01:57:30]  From New York  Just to see the Islanders  And Flyers play in Philly  What a waste of time  That was  No I want the Sabres  To win it all  Alright man  Well go Sabres  And I'll talk to you later  Alright  I'm not a big hockey fan  But I've been kind of  A Sabres fan  Like for a long time  So I'm hoping they win too  Alright let's go to  CJ in Atlanta  CJ  Liar  CJ  Yeah  Go ahead CJ  Hey  So Ope  Are you going to continue  To bitch and whine  Now that you actually  Get your way  Yeah this is kind of 
[01:58:00]  A bad thing  Because now  Ope gets his way  See you know what  And we're so used to  Not getting our way  I just say what  Everyone else is thinking  In the studio  I get a really bad  Reputation for bitching  But I mean you should  Hear the stuff we talk about  When the commercials are  Playing and behind the scenes  And then I vocalize it  For the team on the air  So I'm  I'm looked at as  The big ass  Hence us being fired  So many times  You know  Let's all start bitching  Now I like that  That it works  It's like  That's why you don't  Negotiate with terrorists 
[01:58:30]  Because they're going to  Keep doing it  Because it works  I'm just very impressed  With what CBS  Has brought to the table  So far for this show  You know we came here  The studio  It was a disaster  It only took two weeks  To get it together  XM promised us  An extension of the studio  They did build for us  Originally  And we're still waiting  On that  Playing favorites  We asked for the Stanley Cup  It only  You know I bitched  Two or three times  In the air  And here it is  And I understand  That they're bringing  Black Sabbath  And as a band  Reuniting  Yeah yeah  Because I will follow  Tom Holm and bitch  Until we get Sabbath 
[01:59:00]  Well this has been  An amazing turn of events  Opie  Yeah it really has  We're not used to  Things actually happening  No  And this is  Hey  You know something  Some of the people here  Aren't completely off the hook either  Because CBS radio  Used to be a little thing  Called Infinity Broadcasting  And we got crapped on  Plenty of times  When we worked for them  I don't know who can remember that  We are old  It's so old  I barely remember  But I remember  Nah you gotta  You gotta learn how to forgive  You know what this is 
[01:59:30]  This is a hot girl  Who you look at  And she actually looks back  And smiles at you  And means it  That's what this is  How do you know  Because I'm saying  This is what it must be like  Yeah  Let's rephrase it  We gotta bring  Club Soda Kenny  To a microphone  Because he  I think he's a little nervous  Right now  Because he has a big job  With Master Poe today  Is it illegal to carry  Something of this weight  It could glare  And hurt somebody  I got you covered  Everything's fine  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Because they have agreed  To let us walk  With the Stanley Cup  To XM Satellite Radio 
[02:00:00]  So hopefully  There'll be some pests  In the lobby today  I'm sure  The looks we're gonna get  On the streets of New York  As we walk down the street  With the Stanley Cup  Is gonna be amazing  You know what  I like the thought  That there might be  Some marginal hockey fans  That don't really know  The schedule or anything  And they know it's like  Close to the end of the season  But maybe  They'll think  We're hockey players  And we won  And we're walking the streets  That's right  Can I hold half the cup?  Can I hold one side of the cup?  Alright  Alright 
[02:00:30]  Oopsie  We're a hockey team  The New York Zilches  Before we get out of here  First of all  Brother Joe  We're gonna continue  With you over at XM  Yeah  You have a plug right?

[02:01:30]  That is very very cool  I heard you guys  Were doing a gig  Actually at Distress Factory  On Memorial Day weekend  Is that true?  With little Jimmy Norton  Oh I forgot I was there  Jimmy Cakes  Jimmy Cakes  I'll have the Stanley Cup  With me too  People at the show  Get to touch it  Check out 2U  They're terrific  More info  www.notyou2.com  They're just amazing  They do a great job  Thank you Ops  What are you?  I was gonna say something  That got me in trouble before  But forget it  Corey in Minnesota  Corey  Hey guys 
[02:02:00]  What's up?  Hey  Hey Opie  Forget that XM  Gave you guys  A new light fixture  Over there?  We did get  A new light fixture  Oh yeah  New lights  Terrific  Alright before we get out of here  And walk with the Stanley Cup  In just moments here  We gotta play this Jimmy thing  From yesterday  This half of the show  Did not hear this yet  We were doing a bit  Just to kill time  To be honest with you  We were doing a bit  To kill time  Where we were playing  The most depressing songs  Of all time  According to this new book  Yeah 
[02:02:30]  I hate myself  And I want to die  I think was the name  Of the book  Or something like that  And there was a whole list  Of the most depressing songs  Of all time  And one of the songs  Was Hurt  By Nine Inch Nails  Done by  No but  Well  The one that made the list  Was Nine Inch Nails  Hurt  Oh it was  We said Johnny Cash's version  Is much more depressing  Much more depressing  And much better  Even Trent Reznor  Basically said  When he heard  When he heard that version  I was reading it  In one of the mags  He was working on a record  With his guys  And they 
[02:03:00]  They got the Johnny Cash recording  And they played it  What mag?  Yeah I know  Alright Reg  That's the only reason  I jumped on you about that  And Trent Reznor  Was just blown away  By the version  They kind of just  Stopped the recording  Stopped it  And just said  Hey man  You want to go get coffee?  Like they were just  So uncomfortable  They couldn't believe  How well Johnny Cash  Do with the song  It's gotta be weird to hear  Your work  So made somebody else's  Like you know what I mean  Like that's Cash's song now  No one remembers  Nine Inch Nails  Oh did you ever see  I'm sorry to interrupt him  But did you ever see 
[02:03:30]  The video  To Johnny Cash's video  Oh yeah  That'll kill you  That'll kill you  It's a great video  And MTV stinks  Because they didn't give  Johnny Cash video of the year  It went to Justin Timberlake  And I believe he referenced  The fact that it should've  Went to Johnny Cash  Are you kidding?  No  It was one of the greatest videos  Ever made  And they gave it to Justin Timberlake  Because he was so  Timberlake  Whatever  He makes boots on the side  Yeah  Because he was so hot that year  Because they stink  They really do stink  And Johnny Cash was in  Failing health  His wife had just died 
[02:04:00]  Yeah they should've done  The right thing  And gave him video of the year  But they didn't  Soulless asses  I mean because the video  Is filmed in an old  Johnny Cash museum  That what  Was falling apart  The doors were closed  For many many years  And they actually  Opened up the doors  And filmed a video in there  Where the whole place  Is just falling apart  And this was a place  To you know  To  Was a tribute to  Johnny Cash  And they gave it  To somebody else  Whatever  So we were talking about  The most depressing songs  Of all time  We got into the discussion  Of Johnny Cash and Hurt  We decided to play 
[02:04:30]  A little bit of it  And well Jimmy  Had a little fun  With the song  Listen to this  Can we get a taste  Of Johnny Cash doing Hurt  This song is  Deeply depressing  I Hurt Myself  Today  Here he goes  Hello  I'm Johnny Cash  Should have had  Joaquin Phoenix sing this  I Hurt Myself Today  I Hurt Myself  Today  Did ya  To see 
[02:05:00]  If I still  Feel  Well do ya  I focus  On the pain  Did ya  The only thing  That's real  Is it  The needle  Tears a hole  Does it  The old familiar  Sting  Is it  Try to kill it  All away 
[02:05:30]  Do ya  But I remember  Everything  Do ya  What have I become  My sweetest friend  Everyone I know  Goes away  In the end  Do they  All right 
[02:06:00]  We get it  Yeah  Could I  Jimmy's such an ass  I love that bit  Where'd he go  There he is  Do ya  Do ya  Hey  What are you doing  I was in the bathroom  Were ya  All right  You're a scream  Am I  Well we want to thank  Stanley Cup Guy  For showing up  With the cup today

[02:07:00]  Where the cup's  Gonna be in Jersey  A lot of  Private  Oh it's a private thing  Oh  Hey  Whites only  Oh my god  Jeez  They took my  Inappropriate bell  All right  Let's say hi to John  And Philly  John what's up  Hey I wanted to ask  You guys about  Supposedly on the cup  There's two teams  That are  Basically  They never won the cup  Is that true  Two teams  That never won the cup  That are on the cup  Is that true sir  Yeah  I think it's 
[02:07:30]  Early 70's  Senators  And another team  I forget  But I read it  Somewhere a while ago  You must have read it  There's teams  On there  Like for example  Winnipeg  Is on there  As a team  That was defeated  And Kenora  But Kenora won the Stanley Cup  Actually in 1907  See originally it was called  The Challenge Cup  So you could play for it  Two or three times a year  And there are teams on there  That show who they  Challenge for it  Oh really  Yeah  So there are actually  A few teams on there  That have never won it  Their name is saying  You know  That they played  The Montreal Canadiens 
[02:08:00]  But got defeated  You know  On a score of like  You know  12 to 8 or whatever  Then they realized  That was a pretty stupid  Thing to do  Waste room with the losers  That was in the early 1900s  But there are a few teams  On there  That had their name on there  But didn't win it  We're defeated  Is what it says  Alright cool  Thanks guys  Alright  Look at that thing  And realize you know  There were no  Jet aircraft or anything  No cell phones  No cell phones  Could have had you shot  I like to call it  The good old days 
[02:08:30]  Well I got my thing  What do you guys want  Brought to the studio  Sabbath  Just Sabbath  That's all I want  I'm saving mine  For something  How about saying Sabbath  So it could be two of us  No cause I don't care  About Sabbath  You do  No I don't  What's the one thing  You would want in this studio  Anthony  Wow  I have no idea  I mean the Stanley Cup  For me is definitely  Way up there  In the studio  Way up there means  There are going to be  More bitch fest  Oh no  It's way up there  See you didn't want to  Say the top thing  For me there's always 
[02:09:00]  Something a little more  The Stanley Cup  Is in the top six  I like to keep it interesting  That's all  What's the one thing  Anthony  Off the top of my head  It really can't come up  With anything  Something from Hitler  Let me see  Yeah it probably would be  Some type of  World War II memorabilia  Nothing Nazi  Call it whatever you want  Even bronze tampon  I know  I like  The whole 40's  And I like  They call it memorabilia  If it makes you feel better  I like the war era  Stuff like that  So probably something 
[02:09:30]  From World War II  Perhaps you know  Patton's  Chrome helmet  Here we go  De Niro  I wouldn't mind  Having De Niro in studio  I'll take De Niro  Or Sabbath  It can't be a person  Why can't it be a person  It's gotta be a thing  No we started it  We started it  It's a thing  It's a thing  No there's no thing  It's a thing  People come in here  All the time  Okay I want  I want  I want a thing  I want a band  Black Sabbath  No  No  How about  Something from  Neil Armstrong 
[02:10:00]  First man on the moon  His space suit  That would be something  I would like to see  Get me Neil Armstrong's  Space suit  You know we got  Psychotic fans  You know one day  We're gonna be doing this show  And Neil Armstrong's  Gonna be gagged  And hog tied  Dude I brought him  Dude I brought him for ya  You can ask for a person  Unless they're dead  No we started the thing  It's about bringing a thing  No it was about  Having something you wanted  Being taken care of  By CBS  For you it was a thing  But for me it's a person  It's gotta be a thing  No  Yeah the bits start

[02:38:00]  Yeah you know what  CBS just went out of their way  To do something really really good for us  And then what do we do  We messed up the finale  Of Amazing Race  It wasn't  We didn't even know  If they were the real guys  It wasn't intentional  Right  And they're the ones  That said it  Alright  Thank you  We're like Amazing Race guys  All they had to say is  No we're not  Candyman  Hey good morning boys  Good morning  I'm real happy  That you guys  Never put a wow sticker on  And defaced the Stanley Cup  Because that would have  Sparked an international incident  Jim actually 
[02:38:30]  Said he should do it  You would have had to attend to  With our P-shooters  And our kayaks  Was that you  Yeah I said put a wow sticker on  Yeah  But I didn't know  If a wow sticker  Would come right off  It would be very funny  If you knew it would  Just peel right off  It would leave like  The residue  But can you imagine  Going to peel it off  And like an eighth  Of an inch comes  And you're like  Uh oh  You ever try to get  A sticker off  And you're like  It's never happening  Yeah  Oh my god  Dave in Florida  Hey what's up boys  Hey Dave  Hey guys  I wanted to let you know  Remember these guys  Down in Miami  That had Aries on  Yes 
[02:39:00]  Paul and Ron  Yeah  Ron and Paul I think  Or Paul and Ron  Yeah  I don't have XM in my house  So when I'm getting dressed  I have to listen to them  They've been on three occasions  Blatantly blatantly  Ripping you guys off  Tell them Fred  We invented everything  Here on our program  Tell them Fred  The first thing they started  The first thing they started doing  Is car crashing people  Oh they're doing that  Exactly the same way  Failed jokes  The same car crash  And then  And then 
[02:39:30]  Next thing they did  Was  They started repeating  Rebatim in the last week  That  That  He's getting fucking fresh with me  Lying from Goodfellas  Oh really  Bastards  And then today  They tried to get some guy  To go into a Starbucks  And start singing  Get out of here  You're lying  And they said  Make sure it's a Starbucks  You're lying  It looks like they  It looks like they might have  A little XM in there  How about this  If someone can get audio  Yeah  Of that 
[02:40:00]  We would like to hear some audio  Because we have a tendency  To be dicks  And just attack people  For no reason  I'm breaking your balls  And no matter what  You're getting fucking fish  So right now  I just say  Before we teach these kids  Some fucking manners  Teach this kid  A little fucking manners  Henry are you nuts  I have the audio  You got the audio  No I wish I had  Of course he wishes  I'm sure somebody will get it  Yeah if someone out there  Might have  What's the name of the show  Paul and Ron  Or Ron and Paul  Or something like that  Alright  People are  People are suggesting 
[02:40:30]  Things they want  And no  We do not want  Lance Armstrong's testicle  Anywhere near the studio  I know it would  What if it's in a jar  What if it's in a jar  What if  How else would it come  In a napkin  People are suggesting  Things  Hanging from a necklace  I don't think  I want to see them  One half of a clickety clack  Zach in Jersey  Hey you guys should get  Ted Williams head  In the studio  Alright  That's something  I wouldn't mind seeing  Ted Williams head  Ronnie in Florida  We're getting ready  To do the dump report 
[02:41:00]  A block  Stay on the line  Ronnie what's up  Yeah maybe Anthony  Would like the picture  From Goodfellas  One dog looking this way  The other dog looking that way  He's got to say  What do you want from me  Wouldn't that be something  Imagine that  One dog goes one way  And the other dog  Goes the other way  And this guy's saying  What do you want from me  Right  Having that painting  We used to do a bit  Bring the coolest thing  You own to the studio  Coolest thing you own  We should start that up again  And people brought  Some really crazy things  What's like the coolest thing  You own  You think 
[02:41:30]  I mean  Honestly  If Dr. Steve really got it  I got a Kirk Cobain autograph  I would think Dr. Steve  Was pretty legit  The first time he got me one  He realized that it was a phony  He got really bummed out  And he really went to town  And supposedly the one I got  Is real  Yeah  So that's up there for me  That's pretty cool  You it's got to be a picture  Or autograph  Something  I won't even count photos  Because we all know what that is  Let me think for a second  One of the coolest things I own  Is  Well yeah  It is an autograph 
[02:42:00]  It's Richard Pryor  He signed a card for me  I hand him my business card  And he signed it  But I would have to say  I have a great thing  It's an uncashed  Richard Pryor  Check  I saw that  From the Mod Squad  It was a residual check  I guess he did something  On the Mod Squad  From Aaron Spelling's  Production Company  Wow  And it's like 20 bucks  It was probably some residual check  He got years after  For a syndicated showing  That's one of the coolest  That's pretty cool  Yeah  I don't have shit  A Strat with 1965  Original Fender  Pre-CBS pickups  Thank you  That's a good one  Oh yeah 
[02:42:30]  Alright  A couple more things here  Let's say hi to Joe  In Massachusetts  Joe what's up  Hey you can do the walk  With the axe from Shining  And you can come across  That bum on the street  With a bad leg  Yeah where is all that  Where is all that  That might  Some things you don't know  Some things just get reused  In other  In other films  Like the sweater I wear  In Lucky Louie  I wear it almost every scene  And someone told me  In Wardrobe man  There's a record of  What these things have done  Before you wear them  And do you know  I know  I'm going to find out  Look up your sweater  They don't go back

[02:43:30]  An interview with you guys  Second thing  I want to know  How Ben's interview  Went yesterday  We're going to get to that  Is it in front of us yet  I forgot about that  Yeah Ben went to Washington  To interview David Ortiz  Now Ben doesn't do  On air stuff  I don't think I say anything  He doesn't do anything  He doesn't do interviews  Things like that  This is like his first interview  And it's with a hero  And it took him away  From the program  For an entire day  Because  Did you notice  That he was gone  Not at all  And he walked in today  With an interview  I'm like  Where did you see this  And did he say  When Ben 
[02:44:00]  Yeah  You mean you weren't  Here comes Ben  With his interview  Yeah here it is  And we also  Steve put together  I want to talk about  Stallone at one point today  And his awful  Fucking cheese dick dialogue  He's just  He's unlistenably  Yeah you brought to our attention  The Tango and Cash stuff  I was so happy  Last night  I was going around the channels  And I saw that  Tango and Cash  Was just starting  On Cinemax  Or some awful channel  And I turned it on  And watched the entire thing  Okay  Beginning to end unedited 
[02:44:30]  It is probably  The worst movie ever made  I told you  And that fucking  What's worse  Than that cheese dick  Trying to be charming  With the glasses  What I told you  I would go  Yeah he was trying  To be the smart  Kind of you know  Hey I'll teach you  About the stock market  And hey you know  I'm a clever guy  And he's Tango  And of course Cash  With that friggin big  Head full of hair  That what's his face had  Kurt Russell  Kurt Russell had  And it didn't matter  What type of 
[02:45:00]  Imminent danger  They were in  They would trade  Whitty repartee  With each other  It was awful  And the only movie  Where that to me  Has worked  Was The Lethal Weapons  But no  The first one  I hate any of the  Other Lethal Weapons  I like Part 2  And uh  With Pesci  Yeah but I still  Like the movie itself  And Die Hard  Was fantastic  When that first came out  As long as  To me  Like a witty banter  Doesn't hurt a movie  If it doesn't compromise  The scene  But like I thought  Compromise the scene  It compromised every scene 
[02:45:30]  What's a good movie  That I liked  What was the one  With Will Smith  Independence Day  Started out good  And then him  Fucking doing stuff  Like it's raining  Black folks  Why do you have to  Take me out of the movie  For your fucking  A unfunny  B cheese dick dialogue  Why  Who's laughing  Black folks  Unrealistic crap  And it could have been  Really good  Yeah  Stop doing that  I could teach you a thing  Stop smiling  You're a cleft palated  Ass from Philly

[02:47:00]  Let's go to John  Virginia Beach  John  Hey  Yeah  The axe you were asking about  From The Shining  Yeah  It's at a hotel  In Estes Park  Colorado  Where the interior was filmed  The exterior was filmed  At Timberline Lodge  On Mount Hood  In Oregon  But the interior  Was Estes Park  Colorado  And it's on their wall  In a case  The interior was a set  It was a set  It's uh  The interior  Inside the hotel  It's an open hotel  Now if you go in  It's on display 
[02:47:30]  It was a set  You sure they didn't use  The hotel for anything though  The interior  I know the exterior  Was somewhere  In Oregon  It was Timberline Lodge  In Mount Hood  But the inside  Was a set  No they used it  Watch the behind the scenes  They used it for one scene  I worked at the  Timberline Hotel  So there's a whole history  Behind it  Where is the actual axe  Is it at the  At the place  They did the exteriors  The exterior  On Mount Hood  Where is the axe  He's saying it's in a place  They did the interiors  But the interiors 
[02:48:00]  Were done on a set  The interior was filmed  In Estes Park  Go on, dude  Set, set  It's there now  Alright, thank you, John  Set  I get last word  Because he's hung up on  Let's finally get to  A Block in Ohio  Everyone's suggesting things  But we want you now  To just bring your things  Because they're all  Suggesting stuff  We'll never get  Like our Bud Dwyer's gun  Dangerfield's  Dangerfield's golf bag  From Caddyshack  Christopher Reeve's  Wheelchair  Now it's just up to you  To bring us something  Really cool 
[02:48:30]  That you have in your possession  I want people  A Block, Ohio  What's going on?  What up, spoiled brat  Curvy pal  And little Jimmy Norton  Hey, hey, hey  Why does Jimmy  Get the normal name?  Because I'm normal  You're barely lucky  I mentioned there, Jimmy  You're right  You're the only one  My fucking own agent  Agent doesn't know  I'm on the show  Fuck yeah  Fucking hate him  Hey, I got two bets  For you guys  On something that  Jimmy said  On the free FM  Okay 
[02:49:00]  I think he got dumped  Do you know for sure though?  I don't know  I'm listening on my XM  Three, where's the dump?  Let's get the dump sheet  I should have been dumped today  You want it?  I think you had a couple  Slip up there  Jimmy  The Timberline Lodge  Hold on  Hold on  Shut up  Shut up  The Timberline Lodge  On Mount Hood  In Oregon  Was used for the exterior shots  All the interiors  Were specially built  On sound stages  In London, England 
[02:49:30]  All the interiors  The management  Of the Timberline Lodge  Requested that Kubrick  Not use room 217  As specified in the book  Featuring  Fearing that nobody  Would want to stay  In that room again  So he changed the script  And used the non-existent  Room number 237  What?  Those assholes  Should have realized  That everyone would want  To stay in 217  Everyone would want  To stay in there  217  Hug a chick with a big bush  And then have an old lady  In your arms  Everybody would want  Two dead girls  With an axe next to them  With British accents 
[02:50:00]  Anyone would want  To stay in that room  To maybe be corrected  During the night  A block  So what do you got  On the dump report  You want to make a bet?  Well  One of them  Jimmy said  Shut up and swallow  Just shut up and swallow  Went through  I'm not sure about that  It went through  Absolutely  I have it  And it's also  They're not going to  Shut up and swallow  Could mean anything  I didn't say  Put my hog in your mouth  Then when I finish  Shut up and swallow  That's a little risque to me  Alright 
[02:50:30]  What was the other one?  My other bet was that  Jimmy had the most dumps  Today?  Yeah  Today  None  I've had none today  And I think I've had  One or two  Since we started  Over there dude  Alright well  I think you had two  I guess it's time  For the dump report  Live from the  Opie and Anthony  Show studios  The Daily Dump Report  These are your dumps  For Wednesday  For the first half of the show  Yes  517-06  633 AM  A couple of fucks

[02:54:30]  Stop writing the screenplays  And fucking fixing  You're not gonna be scarier  Than Kubrick  With a film  Anytime he writes  Other people do  His stories  And he's not involved  Except for writing the book  They're good  Shawshank  It's amazing  You're right  But when he gets involved  In the screenplay  You get things like  Maximum Overdrive  And horrid movies  He has some fucking  And he's a great writer  But maybe his screenplay  Is just a different  Ball of wax  If I may  Oh  Hey uh

[02:55:30]  Oh wait a minute  I remember  Maybe you're right  But I also  Independence Day  Oh you know what  You're correct  When I did  The problem with Independence Day  Was the dialogue  He was doing  When he was hitting the alien  Yeah  And dragging  That's when it got awful  Yeah Men in Black  I mixed up the movies  Okay  Alright  Why don't we take a break  Because in front of us  We got Ben  Interviewing Dave Ortiz  Oh this can be  Ortiz  Legendary  And we got Jamie Kennedy  Stopping by in moments  I believe  And Frank Gorshin  Is calling in  Is he really  No  Of course he's not

[03:28:30]  Stop it Ed  Ed Norton  Where's Ben?  Here's the big interview  Yeah let's hear the interview  Get Ben in here  I gotta tell you  They come up with some dumb ideas  I'll bet you Ben's is normal  I'll bet you it's a decent interview  No offense to Ben  No offense to Ben  A lot of offense to Ben  No no offense to Ben  Ben offends me  This isn't one of his things  That he should be doing  But they wanted to have  They wanted one of us  To fly down to Washington  To interview Dave Ortiz  And we said no 
[03:29:00]  And Ben being from Boston  He said yes  Well pretty much Ben got the day off yesterday  Let's be honest  Oh yeah but I did do a lot of meetings  And so I did talk to you  You went to a baseball game yesterday  I went to a baseball game  That was at night  That was at 7 o'clock  So  You flew home today  No I came back last night  You drove home last night  No I took a train back  I like the interrogation tactics we used  Yeah I knew  I knew this  He's just like  I don't know what to do  Everybody  Every single person  That I talked to  From you know  Tony yesterday and Jaime  They're like  You know they're going to say 
[03:29:30]  You just took a day off  To come down and talk to Ortiz  I got our studio plans  Well you kind of did  But it's alright  You got your studio plans  We got the studio plans for here  That we can look at after  Oh plans  What is it a blank paper  Or it's a fucking door  Where the exit sign lit up  I didn't listen  And I'm booting  Dave if you don't want me  To go on those things  I won't go  I don't care  I don't care if you  If you want to be that way  It's you know  Oh  Hey  We all can take this  We all can take this  That kid's got balls  Good for you Ben  Good for you 
[03:30:00]  Ben I'm not  I'm not trash  He's just two little fucking manners  I'm breaking your balls  And you don't matter what  You're getting fucking  I'm tired  I'm a little  Because as far as  The Opie and Anthony show goes  No one gives a crap  That we interviewed Dave Ortiz  Well  And how everything happened  Or Ortiz  I only had two minutes with him  Because he did  Two minutes with you  Alright this is what I'm getting at  Three minutes  Hold on  This is what I'm getting at  Had to take a train to Washington  From New York  That's what  Three and a half hours  Three hours  Yeah and it was  It ran late  Three hours 
[03:30:30]  Then a ride through the ghetto  To the XM compound  To sit down with David  For two minutes  Well we have audio  Of poor Ben  The last part of his trip  Was a little bad  He started to touch me  He started to grab me  I told him to stop  He didn't stop  I hit him back  And then he got really angry  He pushed me out of the car  He should have pushed you  Out of the studio  That fucking performance 
[03:31:00]  So anyway  So what happened was  Yeah let's listen to Ben  First of all  Those artists confidentials  And the baseball confidential  It's a really good take  And if you were a fan of Ortiz  Or a Red Sox fan  Or a fan of the band  Because he talked  For like 90  95 minutes  Wait are there any other bands  Doing artists confidential  I haven't heard anything  About that in a long time  We don't  We get those  We get emails  Every so often  There's emails  We should do one of them  Did you put  The XM mass email  On your spam list  Because then you won't get them 
[03:31:30]  Yeah you never opened  Your Blackberry did you  You get all this stuff  On your Blackberry  I couldn't use it  I tried using it  And the fucking thing  Wouldn't work  It wouldn't work  Why would it work  Blackberries work  For everyone else  In the country  Everyone that's in business  Is using one  I don't want Blackberry thumbs  You want a Blackberry though  No  I don't have one either  Isn't that odd  Opie has Blackberries  It's a Blackberry season  Jimmy doesn't have a Blackberry  They're tart and dog shitty  I fucking hate Blackberries  They're awful  They're ripen a little more  Fucking fuzz on them  Why couldn't you know 
[03:32:00]  Alright so Ben went down to Washington  For this big interview  Yeah so I get there  So Ortiz does like 90 minutes  With Buck Martinez  And you know  And they have the crowd there  And then he does photos  With every person  Autographs  He's great  So he  By the time  He was about ready  That he's going to do  The same with me  He goes  He apologized to me  He goes  I'm really hungry  And I've got to go  To the ballpark  I don't doubt he was hungry  Yeah  He talks about  He talked about food  For like 10 minutes  During the  Big hands on him  It's huge  He's a big dude  So then 
[03:32:30]  Why wouldn't  You know  They told me 15 minutes  Originally  So then it's  Were you nervous  Two minutes  No not really  Originally I think  I haven't even listened to it back  But I rushed through the beginning  I started talking really fast  I don't think I was nervous  I said Ben talking fast  So  And that was the other problem  I actually had some good stuff  To talk to him about  And you know  They said you could ask  Four questions  Or whatever  Four questions  Four questions  With Ben Sparks  The show gets a lot of respect  It's funny  He was in  Boston was in New York recently 
[03:33:00]  Did we get any players in  No  Let me tell you something  I mean  We got one baseball player so far  No  I know you're going to  Listen  I know you're going to  Kick the shit out of me  I already know  Don't you sell yourself short  Now but  You're a tremendous slouch  The questions and stuff  I got to be honest  When we were doing it  And it was  The interview was going on  Some of the stuff  It went so fast  I didn't even have a chance  To listen back to it yet  I don't really know  What he said  On some of the answers 
[03:33:30]  It's kind of hard  You understand him  No  Listen to him  You're just like Larry King  It was a little chaotic  It was a little chaotic too  Because you have his agent  Looking at you  Going like this  It was a little chaotic  Did you think it was just  A make a wish foundation wish  I think we all know  That this is a train wreck  Alright Dan  I think it's going to be good 
[03:34:00]  I think it's going to be  A lot better than  Everyone thought it would be  That's right  Everyone thinks it's going to be shit  But I think it's going to be  You guys are dicks  It can't possibly equal  The low expectations  We have of it  It couldn't be worse  Than we expect it to be  Here's Ben  And his exclusive interview  With David Ortiz  Oh  Fuck  Good  Oh  Five minutes  Okay  I don't know  Let's see  He recorded all that  That's fine  You'll hear David say  That I got to eat dude  Alright 
[03:34:30]  Here we go  Fast fast  I'll be fast  Yeah  How you doing  Good so far  He's ready to roll guys  You're rolling  Alright  Let's park down there  Alright  Right from this start  As soon as he sits down  You shit your pants  Yeah right  I'll go home and get your  Fucking shine box  What is wrong with that? 
[03:35:00]  Everything  What was it wrong with it?  It almost sounds like  You were sitting down  Trying to be  More  Of an interview  So you went like  Alright  Can we adopt that  Every time a celebrity  Comes in now?  Do you realize  We didn't get past  His first word?  He said  We didn't get past  His first word  Can we hear  Alright again?  There we go  Of course  Alright  Oh okay 
[03:35:30]  Actually I know what it is too  Because I had  You had a stroke?

[03:36:30]  I just want to thank  The Twins  For letting you  Come over to us  Screwing that  I got a laugh  I want to ask you  About how your swing  Improved  Do you even know  What that  See  Well if you're  A baseball fan  Oh wow  Oh wow  Are you flustered  If you were a comic  If you were a comic  I  I  The Twins  Just let him go  They just let him go  Twins let him go  So it's like  Okay  So  Okay  I would like to thank  The Twins from The Shining  Because they're not  As horrific 
[03:37:00]  As this interview  The end of it  Ortiz and the agent  Are just chopped up  In the corner  With Max  Come interview us  Ben  Hello  Hello  Ben puts an axe  Through his chest  Here we go  Keep it going  Come on  Now so far  It's a good interview  Fuck you Jim  It's a good interview  I think it's good  This is more of a speech  Speech  And we have Bill Burrard 
[03:37:30]  Bill would have enjoyed this  He's a Red Sox man  That's right  This is great  He's not a Red Sox man  Here we go  You're doing fine  So far so good  I want to ask you about  How your swing improved  Since you went from  The Twins  To the Red Sox  Your batting average  Obviously has improved  And  What looks to me  As a better swing  Well you know  In the game  The longest you play  You get more experience  So  I  What I  Have done  Through the year  Is just  Cut off 
[03:38:00]  Those little things  That  As a leader  You do  To  To get you away  From going from  Point A  To point B  To point B  To hit the ball  Now wait a second  If this was  If this  If this  Was on  But listen  Now say  If this aired on 175  If this aired on  The Home Play Channel  This would have been  A decent interview  But  Really  Yeah the questions  Are doing  This should air  On the Mad Mexicans show  Point A  Point B  Hit the ball  Alright  What I did was 
[03:38:30]  That change  Of the swing  Was the  Point A  To point B  To point B  To hit the ball  You know  I just kind of  Short everything off  Try to be more quick  Than  Having more movement  Living in New York  As a Red Sox fan  Something I appreciate  A lot  Is that your  Batting average  In Yankee Stadium  Is the highest  In  You know  At any  At any stadium  There's no chance 
[03:39:00]  You're ever going to  Become a Yankee  Right  Now that we've signed  You for a while  You know  I've got to stick around  For a long time  Now here in Boston  I love being a Red Sox  A player  Everything's been going  Well  Everything's been working out  Really good  So  He's a Negro  No chance I can turn you  Into a Pats fan  From a Packers fan  You know what  I'm not a Packer fan  Anymore  I'm not going to be  Up in Wisconsin  Got to follow my  And at this point  They said  Wrap it up 
[03:39:30]  Wrap it up  It's only a minute  And a half in  They said wrap it up  Right here  Just so you know  So  I mean something  Interesting's coming  The last thing  Was a good  Was a good  Some good inside  Information here  That I'd gotten  From  That's not good  Inside information  About the world  Rumors they don't  Want going around  No he was cool  With it  He said something  Great during the  The baseball  Confidential  He talked about  When they beat the  Yankees in game 
[03:40:00]  Seven  You know to go  To the World Series  He goes yeah  I got relayed that  Night  And he was  He's very chill  And very relaxed  He gets it  Here we go  The Patriots now  Yeah  One last  One last question  What was going on  With you during  The World Baseball  Classic  With the pitcher  From Cuba  No you know  It was a game  That  Those games  That  You don't have  Everything going on  You know  You're kind of  Slow  It's a day game  It's not  You're not in the 
[03:40:30]  Move at the time  So  While I was hitting  You know  I'm all calmed down  And everything  The guy make a pitch  I swing  I miss it  Then he was like  Kind of  Showing me up  Like come on  I got something for you  You know  Things like that  A pitcher normally  Doesn't do  So  It was just  Kind of  That kind of  Waked me up  And then  I hit a ball  And  Later on  I see the catcher  Going off on the pitcher  But it was  Things that happened  I heard there was  Some foul language  Being used 
[03:41:00]  Well thanks a lot  I appreciate you  Doing a couple minutes  Thanks for having me  So that was it  And  Oh wow  Getting Jim's ball signed  So  There you go  It wasn't  Come on  The questions were good  My problem  Isn't your interview  My problem is that  They only gave you  Four questions  Yeah  I mean  Realistically  I know you guys  Want to kill me here 
[03:41:30]  Those  No it's fine  No there's not  The other baseball fans  In here  Travis would probably  Travis  Good question  Good question  Good question  And I want to get  To the Manny Ramirez  Stuff with him  And how nuts  Manny is  I had like  Three pages  Not questions  But like  Bull points  No this was a good question  Are you going to be a Pats fan  Was important  Pedro from Winter Park  Pedro  What's going on guys  Hey  Yo I think  For this interview  The only thing missing  For Ben  Is if he did a little  Farley and go to David  And said something like 
[03:42:00]  Remember when you  Hit that home run  In James Stokes  It was awesome  The Chris Farley bit  You didn't think  It was a good interview  No he's gone  Sorry  That was kind of like  The Farley bit  It was alright  It wasn't that bad  It was definitely worth  Taking a day off  Yeah  But you've been working hard  So you know  Ben's killing you  Ben this was an important thing  It wasn't  No no listen  I could care less  I really could  If you don't want me to do it  I won't do it  I could  No  I don't care  I never care about getting 
[03:42:30]  Pictures with a celebrity  Are there future things  That might come across  Like this  Dude all kidding aside  You've been working hard  And you got a nice day off  Is what it comes down to  And you got  You got a few minutes  With you know  And we got to  And then the other thing  Was when we did go to the game  When I went to the game  With some of the XM guys  The Ortiz hitting  In batting practice  Holy shit  Almost  I'd say 80% of the balls  He hits out  Yeah let's go to  Louie and Yonkers  Louie  Yo what's going on boys  What do you say Lou  Hey  We're all watching  Ben on Pal Talk here  And you know 
[03:43:00]  You always say  What a herky jerky  Motherfucker  I mean  He's moving around  Like Michael J Fox  Does he have MS or something  Michael J Fox  Doesn't have  MS  He has  Parkinson's  Don't just start assigning diseases  Punch it out  Alright  You stink  Hey Michael J Fox  What does he have  AIDS and Tourette's  Alright  Doesn't MS slow you down actually  It's the other way  Of course it does  You don't herky and jerk  You just  Blurk  I knew there was something there  Good job Jimmy  Blurk  Blurk 
[03:43:30]  Blurk  Blurk  Blurk  Alright  Blurk  Very good  Good job Ben  Very good Ben  Yeah  It was not bad  It was a  It was a  Could you understand  Some of the shit he says though  Yeah  I wasn't really listening  To tell you the truth  Sounds like the promoter  I'm dealing with from Honduras  Okay  No good job  That's fucking soft  What an awful interviewer he is  Was he just gonna ask a question  And let that guy babble for an hour  How about fucking asking  Stop with  Blurk  You ever go down to  West 30th in Boston 
[03:44:00]  Blurk  No one gives a shit  If he's a Patriots fan  Get to the meat of the issue  Why did you jump up and down  On my luggage  Oh jeez  You made the right choice  Because they wanted the whole show  To go down for that  But that would have been funnier  If we all went down  Joe let's play your dumb game  He had a problem though  Because this is really how  The interview ended  We're gonna get to play my dumb game  Oh that uppity nigger  Went and hit me on the head  With a shovel  That's why I was  Nodding yes at you  And I knew that's why  You're hesitating  It's one of my favorite clips  From Blazing Saddles 
[03:44:30]  Alright we're playing  Brother Joe's dumb game  The dumb game  I'm the first one to agree with you  How many you got  Three different bands  And one of them's the real deal  The other one is a tribute  And they're both live  They're both  Yeah they're live  And yeah  So what's the first band  The first one's gonna be  Steely Dan  Steely Dan  Could be live Steely Dan  Or it could be  A tribute band  Okay  What's the stupid tribute band name  Do we get to hear both 
[03:45:00]  The tribute band name is  Danny Steele  Do we get to hear both  That's what they call  Our own Danny  It's a porno name  Danny Steele  You hear track one  And then track two  One of them is the real  And one of them  Pulls his balls out  In front of the fucking  Peltor camp  Is this  The real Steely Dan  Gotta get to the chorus 
[03:45:30]  That's really a good verse  You gotta give it to 
[03:46:00]  Whoever that is  I hope it's Steely Dan  Or is this who  Or is this Steely Dan  I say this is Elliot 
[03:46:30]  From American Idol  This game's way too easy  Yeah  First one  I'll tell you why  First one's the cover band  That's really Steely Dan  Are you kidding?  No and I'll tell you why  Because Steely Dan  The first band's trying to sound 
[03:47:00]  Too much like Steely Dan  And the exact recording of the song  I would say the first one  Is Steely Dan  And the second one's the cover band  No way  I say option three  Who cares Steely Dan  Sucks  If it's not Black Sabbath  It's not Sabbath  So you say the first one  Is Steely Dan  I say the first one  Because if that isn't Steely Dan  Everyone in Steely Dan  Should just kill themselves  I say the opposite  I say first one  I say without a doubt  First one  Absolutely  First one  I say the second band  Is Steely Dan 
[03:47:30]  I say the first  He thinks it's Steely Than  Because his name  Or when he babysits  It's Feely Fan  You're the only one  That says that the second  So wait  So everyone  Everyone says the first band  Good for you  First band is Steely Dan  First band Steely Dan  I say second  I'm the only one in the room  You're going with the  Not the obvious  What about Friday morning  Quarterback guy  First band  He's saying first band  Steely Dan  I think it's too obvious  That way  Everyone is wrong  Except dope  What? 
[03:48:00]  Dead serious  No way  I don't want to show you  I believe you  You don't have to show me  Because you wrote it down  Look  I'll show you  I typed this  I could have made it  I'm telling you  Because to be a tribute band  You've got to sound  Exactly like the record  That's exactly right  Now that works both ways though  Because some tribute bands  Just don't  Can't  You know  They can't sound like  The original band  Wow  That was amazing  It was  The harmonies and everything  Perfect  Were perfect  And then the Steely Dan  Lead singer guy  Didn't sound like Steely Dan  By the way  That band was called 
[03:48:30]  Danny Steele Orchestra  And they're from  Birmingham UK  Wow  The UK  Alright we've got two more  Yeah  Now it's going to be easy  Got to give them  Do  Do  Track  Play track  Track 3  Okay  What bands are these?  This one is  Crosby, Stills, Nash  What's the tribute band name?  The tribute  Is  Sosby, Krills  And  It's going to be something stupid  No it's Four Way Street  Ah, Four Way Street 
[03:49:00]  Okay now the next  To the point  Where I'm no fun anymore  I am sorry  Sometimes it hurts  So badly  I must cry out loud  I am lonely  I am yours  You are mine 
[03:49:30]  You are what you are  It's live  You make it hard  Alright, it's live  Now play track  Number  Number  Five  Five  Alright  Alright  It's getting to the point  Where I'm no fun  Where I'm no fun anymore  I am sorry 
[03:50:00]  That is still in love  Sometimes it hurts  So badly  So badly  I must cry out loud  Nice  I am lonely  I am lonely  I am yours  You are mine  You are what you are  Track three  You make it hard  Alright, I know  I already know  I know  That's a tough one  I say the second one is Crosby, Stills and Nash 
[03:50:30]  Because they're taking too many liberties with the arrangement everyone's familiar with  That's what I thought about the first one  You wouldn't do that if you were a tribute band  You would want to stick to the  Yes, indeed  I, no, no  I think the first one is the band  The big cozy bear is agreeing with me  No, the first one is the real band  Because you can't have it both ways two times in a row  And you see, the band is not going to be  You're not  He's thinking too much  Number one, I say  Number one  I say  The second band is the real band  I think tribute bands don't make a lot of money 
[03:51:00]  So the first one was a really shitty recording  That was the best thing you could come up with  Unless it was like some internet show that Crosby, Stills and Nash did  You never know  I will also go with the second band  Second band being Crosby, Stills, Nash  Yes  Anybody else?  Anyone else?  What do you think there, FMQB?  Everyone's saying two  One  You're going with the first band  Alright, well  Number two is Crosby, Stills and Shitty Sounding Nash  The second band is the real band  The second band is the real band 
[03:51:30]  Two for two  Good  Me too, as I should be  Very good  Wow  That was very, very good  I didn't think a cover band would go that off of the original song  No, Anthony's on some though  Too many liberties  That's why this game is so easy  Yeah, that was Woodstock  It was?  Yeah, that was them at Woodstock  Oh, really?  I hear there were some narcotics there  The fake Sweet Judy Blower  Those guys were tripping their balls off when they did that  Yeah, of course  Six  What's the band?  What's the  It's Van Halen 
[03:52:00]  Oh  Featuring Diamond Dave  Or featuring  Sammy Hagar  Diamond Dave  I heard he was on the radio  A couple of months  I hear  Hello  We'll be right back. 
[03:52:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:53:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:53:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:54:00]  I say number one is Van Hagar.  Van?  I say number one is Van Halen.  Number one.  What do you think there?  Going with one.  One being Van Halen.  Really?  You know, this game does not suck, Opie.  No, it's easy, but it does suck.  If I go three for three, the game sucks. 
[03:54:30]  Trust me.  I'm just not.  And even if you don't.  What did you say it was?  And I'm just not that smart.  If I can figure this out.  You said that the tribute band was which?  Well, I'm looking at your poker face now.  I might change my vote.  But that takes away from the game.  In all fairness, I said two.  You said two was what?  Tribute?  No, Van Halen.  Was really Van Halen.  Yeah.  Or some form of that band.  Two was Van Halen.  Right.  Okay.  What was it?  Well, this one was a trick answer. 
[03:55:00]  Oh, no.  Why?  No, no, no.  Opie, you're right.  It was Van Halen.  But the first one was a tribute band with Michael Anthony playing bass and singing backup.  That was what threw me.  It was a very high vocal.  That was Michael Anthony.  That's right.  Everybody wins.  Jim.  We're tanks for nothing.  You got three for three.  Yeah, Joe.  And I said, Jim.  Joe, why don't you mix it up a little bit? 
[03:55:30]  Hold on.  Each one was tribute band, real band.  Tribute band, real band.  Tribute band, real band.  Yeah, two, two, two.  Oh, yeah.  Joe, the pattern on the test.  Right, Joe.  It was like, yeah, but you know what, man?  It wouldn't have made it.  And a man in my position can't afford to make me to look ridiculous.  It wouldn't have made it.  That was another reason why I went with number two again.  I have a fun game.  I'm like, he's not sitting at home.  We're going to trick us and make the real band.  How about this?  Here's a fun game.  Everyone close your eyes, and I'll put fruit in your hand. 
[03:56:00]  You tell me if it's an orange or a grape.  That game ate my ass.  I had more fun playing games with my uncle when I was three.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I went three for three.  It's not a good game.  All right.  No, actually, I didn't mind that.  It was a thought.  Joe, I'm joking.  I think if you mixed them up.  Cool.  Yeah.  What was the name of that game?  What Disc Sucks More Than Ben's Interview? 
[03:56:30]  You can't win on this show.  There's no winning.  I don't even try anymore.  No.  It was fine.  I know.  Should we do something?  I feel good about me.  What?  I feel good about me.  Want to do a little tango and catch before we get out here?  Yeah, definitely.  All right.  I forgot about that fun.  All right.  We should play a Brother Joe song or something going into the rush.  Hey, let's guess which one is which, tango or cash?  Ooh.  She has one.  She's getting right out of my hair.  You do me while I whip this out. 
[03:57:00]  Boring.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  How about a Brother Joe song?  I told you, Than.  There is a swear in that one.  How about a Brother Joe song?  What have we got?  I'm reading some of the dialogue from Tango and Cash and just like...  It's fucking putrid.  I don't know why you're so obsessed with this, but...  It's putrescence enrages me. 
[03:57:30]  They were trying to make one of those buddy movies.  Which came first?  Lethal Weapon, right?  Lethal Weapon.  Lethal Weapon.  And they were trying to do like a cop buddy movie thing that was all the rage then.  Two just charmless idiots.  Is that on the movie poster?  It should have been.  Can we take a break and then we'll get into that and then we'll get out of here.  All right.  Then we'll do the interview with FMQB.  We're doing an interview.  FMQB.  Yes.  FMQB, yes.  Jimmy's involved and you will be asking him questions.  I want to be in this interview front and center. 
[03:58:00]  Right.  And I'm never going to be here again, so don't even bother mentioning me.  That was a fun game.  I'm kidding.  Here's a brother Joe song as we go to break.  In the Special Olympics kind of way.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Dry, dry, dry vagina.  Dry, dry, dry vagina.  So before my penis starts to get sore, come pick up some badger lube at your local drugstore. 
[03:58:30]  Said go get some badger lube at your local drugstore.  Oh, you stink, baby.  Prepare to be wowed. 
[03:59:00]  What mockers.  Live them out Wednesday.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow.  The Opie and Anthony program is now returning from a break.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony program.  There was a break, but now that's over.  Very professional.  And the phone numbers are 1-800-WOW-1-WOW-866-1-866-1-WOW-WOW. 
[03:59:30]  You are the worst.  I'm bringing back the Opie and Anthony program from a break.  Horribly, my friend.  You're not like a professional broadcaster.  I am.  Give it your best shot.  Welcome back, ladies and germs.  You throw a laugh in there, but it feels good.  We were on break.  It's whipping out Wednesday.  If you'd like your WOW stickers.  If you'd like your WOW stickers, where can you get them, Jim?  WOW stickers. 
[04:00:00]  Well, since you met this plug, I can tell you this Thursday night at the Red Lion.  Oh.  I will be handing out WOW stickers.  Yes.  Nice shameless plug.  Good.  That's right.  You can get WOW stickers here at the studio or some other places, perhaps.  Very good.  Very informative.  Jesus.  He gets right to the point.  Indy Mike.  Good afternoon, gentlemen.  Good morning.  Indy Mike.  Gee, what do you want?  Well, I wanted to welcome everyone to the bonus time. 
[04:00:30]  I also wanted to get in a little bit of a plug for one of your folks there, Travis.  He's in the running for one of the hottest girls of Pal Talk, the voting which is occurring on fullblownaids.com.  Yes.  And it ends tonight at 10.36 p.m.  So you need to get over there and go to Travis.  Wait, what's that about?  There are the girls of Pal Talk.  It's a wonderful contest that went on where the girls, some of the girls of Pal Talk, showed their goods, showed their pictures. 
[04:01:00]  And, um, yes, we're all punching us now.  Hottest girls of Pal Talk.  Winner!  Do I have a, like, a screen name for that yet?  No.  Please!  Vote for Travis.  Don't you have to sign in to get to that website?  Yeah.  You don't have to sign in to get there.  But where is it?  It's hard to find.  Look at the Pal Talk.  Oh my god, where is it?  Who designed that?  Fucking Steve C?  I can't find girls of FB, girls of what?  What is it?  Go to a Pal Talk.  There's a Pal Talk section on there.  Where? 
[04:01:30]  Oh, cool.  Oh my god, Indie Mike.  Yes, sir.  No one can find this.  This is the worst design page since Foundry Music.  That's right.  I had nothing to do with the design page.  You go to Full Blown Aids, and then where do you go?  You go to the Forums section.  Forums.  Yes.  Scroll down about two-thirds of the way, and there will be a Pal Talk section. 
[04:02:00]  Wow, that's real convenient.  That's right.  I'm sure there will be a link right on the front page within the next 30 minutes to half  an hour.  I'd rather have...  Look out, Doug is a bag of wet dog dicks.  Fix that, Douglas.  I would rather have Full Blown Aids than try to navigate the site.  That can be arranged.  It's easier.  Oh, now I can't get to anything because now it's all froze up.  Because we have too many fans.  Too many listeners.  We're too popular.  Let's start doing shitty radio so we have less listeners. 
[04:02:30]  And we can get to these websites.  All right, Indy Mike, thanks.  By the way.  Thank you, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Before we get into this Tango and Cash thing, I want to read the back of the box to let  people know.  Oh, good.  What they would see.  Because the name Sly...  Because Sly knows how to be cool.  Yeah.  Like when he was Cobra, his name was Marion Cabretti.  Cabretti.  Right.  He's cool.  You're an ass.  Here it is.  Roy Tango.  Oh, yeah.  Thanks. 
[04:03:00]  I wish this was television.  His face gets so pissed off reading this.  Well, it's on PalTalk.  They can see it on PalTalk.  And Gabe Cash, our rival L.A. policeman with one thing in common.  The jokes could just be plentiful here.  Each thinks he is the best.  Yeah, man.  Team them, and they're like oil and water.  See, they don't mix.  Oh, I thought because neither oil nor water is funny. 
[04:03:30]  But frame them for a crime, and they're like a match and kerosene.  What's that?  Mm-hmm.  See, like it would light up.  Oh, I was thinking more like you put them on dog shit and put them on someone's porch and  they step on them like they do this movie box.  Now that's funny, always.  Stallone and Russell deliver sweaty excitement, sex appeal, and outrageous laughs in this action 
[04:04:00]  comedy from the director of Runaway Train.  The two-stage of Prison Breakout that's a breathless rush of weapons and wisecracks.  Oh, God.  Damn it.  Then roar after the shadowy crime lord who set them up.  Tango and Cash are out to clear their names.  Join them and feel the rush.  It's a breathless rush of weapons and wisecracks.  Weapons and wisecracks.  That's like saying the Yates tub is a lake of lather and laughs. 
[04:04:30]  Let's go to Rob in Canada.  Rob.  Hey, boys.  How are you this morning?  I'm very good.  How are you, sir?  Is it XM Canada for you or illegal stuff?  Yeah, what are you doing?  XM Canada.  All right.  Let's go, Rob.  I love you, boys.  Let's go.  Jimmy, I was a little disappointed that your feely fan call didn't get more of a reaction.  All right.  He's happy that got stepped on.  No, I like that one.  Let's go to Chris in Vegas.  Chris.  Feely fan.  Hey, guys.  Hey. 
[04:05:00]  Yesterday, I was driving with my daughter.  She's about nine years old, and she listens in the car every once in a while, but she  usually just zones out, and I figure she's ignoring what's going on.  She's looking at my son's digital watch, can't get it to work right, and in a perfect little  Jimmy voice, she goes, I half expected her to say she was a zilch and a nothing.  I hate this watch.  It's terrible.  Tell her someday she'll have boobies like Jimmy.  Hey, you know what?  You can do all the jokes you want. 
[04:05:30]  I'm looking for a breathless rush of weapons and wisecracks.  All right.  Well, here we go.  Let's get into it.  Ray Tango to police helicopter.  All right.  Now, Tango is which one?  Sly.  Charmless douche number one.  And Cash is Kurt Russell.  A charmless douche number two.  This is Air Unit 3.  Forget it, Tango.  We'll take it from here.  Drop back.  Drop dead.  I've been on this gig for three months.  All right.  I'm going around. 
[04:06:00]  Sounds like a fucking video game.  The acting is really good.  Drop dead.  Drop dead.  Drop dead.  It wasn't really a wisecrack, but, you know.  It wasn't really a wisecrack.  And it says almost unintelligible.  Yeah.  That was completely intelligible.  All right, Steve.  Oh, for one.  Failing already.  Failing already with a no-brainer bib.  With radio gold.  To Steve, that was unintelligible.  Everybody is unintelligible.  Because he's perfectly articulate.  All right.  Here we go.  The number two. 
[04:06:30]  Number two.  Two thugs crash through truck windshield.  And should we give the answer?  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Ray Tango's got a quip.  All right.  Glad you could drop in.  That's terrific.  Now, that's the wisecracking.  That's the wisecracking starting.  He's a wiseacre, this one.  Oh, fuck you. 
[04:07:00]  I prefer blinds.  Do the honors.  The wisecracking didn't stop.  It's amazing how the wiseacre behavior will continue.  All right.  Glad you could drop in.  Cash apprehends suspect after a car chase through a parking garage  or brief banter between police captain and Ray Tango.  Always good when you get the captain cop banter. 
[04:07:30]  I've never heard.  I bet you that there's some kind of a problem.  I don't want to give it away, but I'll bet there's a problem.  But I bet he's such a good cop that the captain can't just let him go.  That's right.  Because the captain also had a hair lip at one point.  We'll do the brief exchange with Russian guy whose car cashed.  All right.  Put on your laughing hats.  What's the matter, Ace?  Got a little headache?  You crazy guy!  What did you do if my car?  I did it in perestroika!  Welcome to America! 
[04:08:00]  I'm a fan of 80s music, kickstand.  Wonderful.  This is arguably the worst film I've ever done.  Yeah.  Just saw it last night.  This makes White Chicks Incorporated look like Citizen Kane.  Unbelievably funny.  All right.  Brief banter between police captain and Ray Tango.  If you really want to stare death in the eye, you should have gotten married.  Is that a proposal?  No. 
[04:08:30]  But do you hear?  You should have gotten married.  Waiting.  Waiting.  Waiting.  Waiting.  Wait for that.  Do you hear this dumb motherfucker trying to charm his way through this film with his smile?  Oh, this cocksucker.  Well, here's Tango and Cash meeting for the first time.  Ooh.  You know me, huh?  Yeah, I hear you're the second best cop in LA.  That's funny.  I hear the same thing about you.  No, just stay off my case.  What makes it your case?  I've been on it for three months and makes it my case.  Mark, you said shows how stupid you are because I've been on it for about half an hour now 
[04:09:00]  and here I am all caught up with you.  Stay off my case.  Nice tie.  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  Wow.  That's some realism.  That's what I liked about these movies back in the 80s.  The gritty realism that you got.  Like real cops.  Just ask people like Kenny and Keith.  This is what goes on in the department.  Sure.  I hear you're the second best cop in LA.  I hear the same about you.  Yeah.  Roll over. 
[04:09:30]  I'm a top.  I hear you're the second worst actor on this bill.  I hear the same about you.  Murder trial for Tango and Cash.  Oh, boy.  Talking about what they're going to do to a detective who was on the stand lying about their bust.  Yeah, they were set up, man.  When these two guys show up, I figure the whole thing's gone sour.  So I'm going to go in and clear everything up. 
[04:10:00]  Talking about the movie?  When this is over, we have to pay Jabba the Hutt here a visit.  I'll bring the chainsaw.  Nothing at this time, Your Honor.  I'll bring the beer.  Ah, I see.  See, this can be like an event.  That's wisecracking.  An event.  Yeah.  Yeah, while they kill somebody with a chainsaw, they'll be drinking beer because they're really  mad at the guy.  When they saw this script, one of them should have said, I'll bring the lighter.  There is no way, first of all, we are going through 25 Tango and Cash clips. 
[04:10:30]  I swear, I'll shoot myself.  I do want to get to the ones, though, where they say each other's names because that was  particularly awful.  Well, where do we go?  Where do we go?  Which one do you want to play?  I mean, they all look just god-awful.  I'm getting so tired right now.  It's bonus show.  This is free.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  My Tango and Cash idea bit stinks.  Not as bad as Brother Joe's bit.  No, I think Tango and Cash bit.  Thank God it's following that.  I'm not taking sides because it's my brother, but I think Tango and Cash bit worse than Joe's 
[04:11:00]  game bit.  Yeah, maybe.  At least there was a kind of a camouflage reason for it.  Like we were almost playing a game, even though it was as hard as chutes and ladders.  But there is absolutely no reason to play Tango and Cash flips.  If my was chutes and ladders, this one's Candyland.  Candyland.  We were almost full.  This is hard.  There's no purpose.  Try number 10.  Gabe Cash flips.  No, no, no.  Do we have to?  How about, no, 11. 
[04:11:30]  Pre-brawl banter between Tango Cash and the big-jawed inmate.  Pre-brawl banter is always saucy and intriguing.  Oh, shit, it's Conan.  What?  It's Conan.  We're going to get Fubar now.  What the hell's Fubar?  You'll see.  Real badass cops.  You don't look so tough now, do you?  Do you, you fuck?  It must mean you.  On the streets, this pig and his cop friends broke my ribs, my leg, and my jaw. 
[04:12:00]  You broke that jaw?  He deserved it.  Why did you do that?  Why?  Yeah, why?  I was having a bad day.  Like now?  Like now!  And then they get into a big fight with 80s music.  It's the dumbest banter into a fight I've ever seen.  And that really is, that was a bad, bad accent.  John in Connecticut, John.  Tango and Cash, Cash and Tango.  Oh, yeah, that was Jack Palance said that. 
[04:12:30]  Tango and Cash.  That's right, Jack Palance was in it.  Shit and dog, dog and shit.  This could be the worst movie I've ever been in.  Believe it or not.  Tango and Cash hang the Aussie out the window.  He should have done one-on push-ups over bayonets before taking this part.  It said long-winded, stupid, good cop, bad cop bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Should we go with it? 
[04:13:00]  Let's try it.  If not, we'll bring Steve in and smack his fat face.  But it's your bit.  No, I didn't get the clips.  I told Steve.  Make them funny.  Fucking Steve should be fired.  This is so stupid.  This bit stinks.  It's not even a bit.  I'm trying.  Jimmy brings a bit every three months.  That's right.  Give him a little credit.  You should switch him up a little bit, Jimmy, and have some good ones in there.  Yeah, have some good, funny clips.  Oh, man, Steve's kicking it.  Oh, no.  Do you like him, sweetie?  No, no. 
[04:13:30]  There's a big cuddly bear on Jimmy.  Come on his face.  Come on his face.  Come on his face.  Again.  Come on his face.  Again.  Come on his face.  I'm sorry, Jim.  Are you taking issue with the fucking game you created?  No, Steve.  I'm not.  Steve had nothing to do with this.  This is the pre-fight banter.  Well, I'm having a bad day.  Jimmy's still trying to sell it, man.  Oh, I know.  He's just selling it.  I have to.  He's trying. 
[04:14:00]  Here's what it is.  He's repeating the bad lines.  He's doing everything again.  It's not translating until a good bit.  To squeeze the funny out of this thing.  But maybe it just doesn't translate, but it's so awful.  There has to be a way to express the awfulness of this fucking dialogue and how annoying this is.  I'd rather listen to clips of Reed and Ash.  That's pretty funny.  Hey, the next time I have a bit idea, if I go, hey, guys, I'll just towel.  My bits fucking suck Dominican balls. 
[04:14:30]  Jimmy, pick out another clip.  Yeah, pick out a funny clip.  That will be the bit.  Jimmy, try to pick out a funny clip.  I like that bit.  Wait a minute.  Oh, boy.  How about...  Pegged by Danny Steele.  How about 13?  Tango jams...  I'm going by shortest.  Tango jams up a large industrial fan wheel, saving cash from being shot.  I don't remember there being much dialogue here. 
[04:15:00]  There's got to be a funny line.  I think there's a lot of...  What are you doing here?  I got lonely.  I got lonely, he said.  He saved him from the big fan wheel.  I got lonely.  You know what?  I don't like the attitude of the host on this show.  Let's vote number 17.  That one I know.  All right.  No, that's really long.  17?  No.  That's the one you specifically asked for.  The one where they're hanging the guy upside down.  Tango and cash.  Hang the Aussie. 
[04:15:30]  Long-winded.  Wait, so this is the one he really...  This is the one he specifically asked me for.  It's all riding on this one, Jimmy.  This is the good cop, bad cop bit.  Yeah.  It's a minute and 40.  Classic.  Because of your snide remarks, the longest one I went for.  The whole Jimmy Norton tango and cash bit rides on this right here.  Rides?  This fucking car is flaming.  Come on, you mean puppet.  Who pulls your strings?  This off.  Bollocks to plan A.  I like this.  It feels great up here. 
[04:16:00]  What do you say?  Plan A's a loser.  Hold on.  Give me that name, death brother.  You're going back to fucking England in a fucking baggie.  Up yours, arsehole.  You ain't worth a toss.  Go on, drop me.  Do it.  First of all...  Penny is definitely a loser.  I don't like this.  I'm starting to make this any longer than it has to be.  But that accent that guy is putting on is second to the Mary Poppins accent that was put on by Dick Van Dyke.  Hey, governor.  Oh, you're not getting the information out of me. 
[04:16:30]  Ugh.  Nothing worse than the bad, limey accent coming from the guy that played...  Brian James.  Kehoe in 48 Hours or one of those movies.  He's in every bad...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was in every bad cop movie.  Yep.  But now he puts on this fake, limey accent and sounds like stupid, no-filter Paul.  Hey, what's the feedback on PalTalk about my tango and cash bit? 
[04:17:00]  Well...  I'd like some words of encouragement.  Let me see.  Well, if they're still listening, that would be great.  I'm sure they're all listening.  Wasn't that billed as an Aussie?  Was that supposed to be an Aussie?  Was it Aussie?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Wow, I couldn't tell what that was.  It stinks and I don't like it.  Best bit ever.  AIDS is better than this bit.  That was from Greg H. 
[04:17:30]  It's stupid.  We love Jimmy.  We hate his bit.  But my bit is everything.  What's next?  Clips from Turner and Hooch?  Steve, get on it.  It stinks.  I'll admit my bit was a dynamic flop.  Terry Hatcher looked good in it.  Here we go.  That should be the bit.  It was a young Terry Hatcher.  Polite things people can say when a bit stinks.  Hey, we only have a minute 20 left in this track.  Right back to it, all right? 
[04:18:00]  Good point.  Well, I know you're getting some good reviews.  It blows dick.  Who is dick?  All right, back to this bit.  By the way, Eddie from Kansas wants to help you out a little bit.  Eddie.  Eddie.  Hey, what's going on this morning, boys?  How you doing, Ed?  Good, Jim.  Hey, I was going to say, you don't have to take the heat for this bit.  It was all Ed Norton's idea.  That's right.  It wasn't me.  That's right.  All right, thank you.  People are wondering if this is a plot just to make E-Rock radio sound better.  No?  Plan A is definitely a loser. 
[04:18:30]  Big time.  Let's go to plan B.  You got a plan B?  Hiroshima, ring a bell?  This is plan B.  Can I talk to you for a minute?  Taping a grenade into his mouth.  Is he?  Just a second, please.  Seriously.  I mean, you're getting a little radical here, aren't you?  What's radical?  Blowing a man's head off with a fucking hand grenade is a touch much, don't you think?  You got your way, I got mine.  You know, I'm kind of glad you didn't want to talk, Rakeem.  You know that?  Let me just shoot him in the goddamn leg.  He'll talk. 
[04:19:00]  I don't want the leg.  I want the whole package.  Maybe he doesn't know anything, okay?  I don't really care.  What do you mean you don't care?  What the fuck is this?  You're a cop.  Look, I was a cop.  Well, because of his dirtbag and his friends, we're on the run.  No.  It's payback.  That's enough.  I mean it.  Is it?  Man, I heard about you.  Did you?  I heard you were a fucking Section 8.  I didn't believe all that weird, sadistic bullshit I heard you pull, but you are, man.  You're for real.  If you don't want to get sticky, get back.  Jack. 
[04:19:30]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  You got it, sicko.  You blew it big time, pal.  This asshole's out of control, and I can't stop him.  But I'm not going down for this, Tango.  I mean it.  You're on your own.  I'm out of here.  Don't forget the right.  You are my vote for the Psycho Hall of Fame, asshole.  You got it.  Oh, my God.  Is that?  Oh, my God.  That is really bad.  The fucking worst thing you've ever heard.  That really sums it up in that one clip.  But no, there's another one.  I don't even think any more needs to be played.  I have to take issue, because Steve, you pointed at number 19. 
[04:20:00]  Why about 19?  Uh, 19 is...  It's the second longest track!  Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.  Wait, no.  When we're getting people now asking to be banned from Pal Talk, so they don't have to listen.  It is sentimental dreck from Stallone, and it is almost as, just as bad, if not worse,  than what we just heard.  This bit stinks worse than Opie's mic after Don talks into it.  All right, the feedback is coming in. 
[04:20:30]  Well, I think that we're going to hear it, though, because...  Oh, my God.  It's not that long.  I want to go home.  All right, do we get an interview?  I want to go home.  I say we do one more.  I want to go home.  Where do they say each other's names a lot?  Look, Cash, if one of us doesn't make it back, I just want you to know that you're the best cop I ever worked with.  I love you.  That's something I want you to know, Ray.  If you don't make it back, and I do, I am going to date your sister. 
[04:21:00]  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Cash, I got nothing against you.  You know that.  You will keep your hands off of my meal.  I just don't want Catherine getting that two-in-the-morning phone call, saying something's happened to you.  Oh, you're like a joke, you faggot.  Well, nothing's going to happen to me. 
[04:21:30]  I'm charmed.  All right, I'll tell you what.  I'll stay away until you give me your blessing.  Boring.  In that case, never.  Never.  Jimmy, can you turn the lights off when you're done?  But there's only a couple more clips.  No, there's not.  They're really short ones where they say each other's names a lot.  I need a shower now.  Which ones? 
[04:22:00]  20 through 25.  Ever.  But look at how short these clips are.  We can't.  They're so short.  They're like eight seconds, three seconds, four and a half minutes.  Can we do my game over again?  I'll mix it up.  I wish, Joe.  I wish.  I say that we...  They station the names here, Steve?  Yes, they do.  All right.  Maybe we can play Joe's game again and make believe we don't know the answers.  Yeah.  Let's give that a try, please.  We're at the location.  Yeah, we're coming up on a very serious-looking date here, Rowan.  Is this place fortified?  I don't know for sure, Cash. 
[04:22:30]  Better use extreme caution.  Cash?  Yeah.  Listen to the man.  Yes, Mommy.  That was the director crashing his car into a wall.  Hey, watch the run.  No, I wanted them to say each other's names in the same moment.  Yeah.  Because that'll help.  Well, this is a long-same moment broken down. 
[04:23:00]  There was a lot of sound effects and explosions.  No, no.  I'm telling you, someone's got to put their foot down.  I really liked your motivation to bring a bit to...  I have a bit, guys.  I see.  Yeah.  Opie.  And...  And...  Hey, what time's our interview? 
[04:23:30]  Yeah, that was, uh...  Well, we can't end like this.  You had a great day today.  We got a lot of fun.  How about you end like this?  For the next 32 minutes, you just play the movie. 
[04:24:00]  We have the unedited, uh, unedited news story about the pit bull.  We were supposed to play that over here.  That, hey, there you go.  Cleanse the palate.  Here's a little sorbet for you people.  Tomorrow, can we do the Rocky IV speech?  Yes.  No.  Too much fun.  Yeah.  That'll be good.  That reminded me of something earlier.  Real quick, the, um, dog, the dog hog rodeo.  Did you guys see that?  Anything about that on, uh...  What?  Dog hog rodeo.  It's about pit bulls.  What is it?  No, you didn't.  It's about pit bulls that, that, uh, they put into, uh, into pens with hogs. 
[04:24:30]  These are white trash down south, put into pens with hogs, and have the pit bull tear  the hog to pieces.  No, this is just how long it takes the dog to kill the hog.  What's the object of the game?  They are saying pit bulls and, uh, Rottweilers.  They use pit bulls and Rottweilers.  Is it a game, though, where you get to bet?  Yeah.  Yeah.  On how long the pig...  On how long it takes the dog to kill the pig.  What's the average?  It's called hog dog rodeo, and I don't know what the average is.  Like it's a minute or ten.  It was like some, some, some, some big, uh, some big expose that some, uh, that a, uh, 
[04:25:00]  a reporter did down south, but, uh, they use exclusively, yeah, exclusively pit bulls and, uh...  We'll play it, uh, minute and 40 second clips.  The poor pig is probably so scared.  It's minding its business.  Oh, it's horrible.  It's awful.  Here's the unedited, uh, unedited news story from earlier this morning.  Cleanse the palate.  It's the pit bull story where, uh, the pit bull owner was asked for some comments, and  he just got really pissed off.  Yeah, pit bull attacked kids.  Five kids or something like that?  Here's the unedited version.  The owner's showing little remorse after his two pit bulls viciously attacked five school 
[04:25:30]  kids getting off a bus and a man who tried to help them.  Can I just talk to you briefly?  Can I talk to you briefly about...  Get the fuck out of here!  Get the fuck out of here, motherfucker!  Get out of here!  The fuck!  Just want to find out what happens.  Did you have anything to say, sir?  Step back, step back.  Step back, step back.  Who's telling him to step back? 
[04:26:00]  Um, I don't know.  Not, um, not that same gentleman that was yelling.  That's for sure.  Sounded like Chris Rock.  How much for a read?  Well, um, let's go.  That's how we leave it.  Yeah.  Well, you fuckers deserved this today.  For what you did yesterday.  What did they do yesterday?  Something.  Oh.  I'll read it later on a message board somewhere.  I still can't get to the full-blown AIDS site, by the way. 
[04:26:30]  I click on forums, the page freezes.  All right, I could leave with something.  Oh.  I think I got there.  An email from, um, a pest?  Yeah, leave with something.  From a pest?  Um, I guess, um, a writer did us wrong, and we, uh, had the pest attack, right?  Uh-huh.  I'm not sure which article.  I'm not sure if it was the Forbes guy or the other guy that, uh, wrote in this big article  that went AP, by the way.  It went viral, uh, that we worked for Sirius Satellite Radio. 
[04:27:00]  So we got the facts wrong.  So the pest attacked.  And, uh, I'm not gonna say who sent this in, but I'll read the email that, that was sent  to, uh, to, uh, this writer.  I'm trying to see if it's, uh, okay.  Actually, it's from, uh, oh, it's the Forbes guy, Anthony.  Yeah.  Do you know what, the Forbes just did us wrong, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, this guy had the information all wrong and everything.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[04:27:30]  Okay, here we go.  So, uh, the pest, and the writer didn't like it, this, uh, Levine guy.  So he writes an email back to the, to, uh, a pest, because the pest threatened some things  on his family, supposedly.  Yeah.  So, uh, Levine writes this, uh, pest back and says, threatening me and my family in print  is a very stupid act, perhaps criminally stupid.  Ask yourself whether Anthony Cumia, a.k.a.  screen name, Wiffle Ball, uh, Wiffle Bat Lube, a.k.a.  President Anthony, I'm not President Anthony, a.k.a.  Ant, will provide.  Hold on, hold on. 
[04:28:00]  I'm not President Anthony on any message boards.  That's never been my name.  President Anthony, indeed.  I will be now.  All right.  Threatening me and my family in print is a very stupid act, perhaps criminally stupid.  Ask yourself whether Anthony Cumia, a.k.a.  screen name, Wiffle Bat Lube, a.k.a.  President Anthony, a.k.a.  Ant, will provide legal representation for you when your computer's IP number is traced  under the anti-harassment and anti-stalking laws currently enforced by several states. 
[04:28:30]  My guess is lawyers for the Opie and Anthony show and lawyers for XM Satellite Radio will  advise both parties to steer, uh, far clear of all you idiots from the whackbag.com bulletin  board.  The legal liability for them, uh, vis-a-vis, is that a legal term?  Yeah, sure.  Probably means I'm a douche.  Uh, vis-a-vis, the conspiracy to commit possibility will be too high.  So then this pest writes back, he wasn't scared off by this guy.  No, not at all.  He writes back, this is a guy with a lot of balls, a lot of balls. 
[04:29:00]  Mr. Levine, could you please point out where I threatened you or your family?  Is it a threat to wish or hope something on someone?  Or as you just, as, or are you just as ignorant of legal issues as you are financial ones?  As for your false claim that I am in violation of anti-Harrisman stalking laws, I would like  to remind Greg Levine, henceforth referred to as Captain McCunt.  That it is not illegal to email the writer of a news article, an opinionated response to one of his articles. 
[04:29:30]  Ask your legal department, they will tell you the same thing.  My response to your article happens to be that I hope you get pancreatic cancer, and that you will be viewed in your final years as nothing more than a burden by your loved ones.  Wishing for that is not illegal. 
[04:30:00]  As a member of the press, I thought you would be, I thought you would be aware of the First  Amendment, but you are obviously not.  Check out this little nifty thing, and then he gives the, uh, the link to a website that,  uh, describes the First Amendment.  Yeah.  I do look forward to you explaining how I threatened you since you accused me of such in your email.  Good day, sir.  Good day.  Blah, blah, blah.  Who, uh.  Great.  Who's just terrific.  He's one of the best ONA pests out there right now.  Oh, this guy has, uh, really big balls.  Says Greg Levine is just a douche. 
[04:30:30]  For Forbes, yeah, because he just, what did he say?  We just, I don't know.  I wrote him a civil letter.  Not like that.  I didn't add Captain McCuntin, but, uh, I wrote him a civil letter about how, how off  he was on his facts.  He had so much stuff wrong in there.  No, I haven't gotten anything back yet.  I don't know.  I think it's you.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Why don't we try to get him on the air?  Yeah, go ahead.  Seriously.  Why don't we try?  I always say get the guys on the air.  Certainly do.  We always let them talk.  When Bill Donahue came on, he talked and we got along great. 
[04:31:00]  Richard Huff, we didn't like, but he came on.  He was great.  We got along with him.  So it's like, you know, and no one's going to be shit on him.  Yeah, Richard turned out to be a really cool guy.  We got to get him back on.  Mike in New Hampshire.  Yeah, this is this.  Opie, you're a retarded fucking ass cunt.  It's vis-a-vis.  Opie, Opie, you're fucking retarded.  Well, we didn't know that either, sir.  Retarded.  Well, I don't know what it means.  Anthony, I love you.  Mike, what is this?  He's from New Hampshire.  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  Well, what does it mean?  Vis-a-vis, it's like, yes, come see, come saw. 
[04:31:30]  This for that.  Tit for tat.  Yeah, it's like, suck mine, I suck yours.  One dog's looking one way.  One's looking the other.  Hey, Syrah.  Syrah.  French.  All right, brother Joe, thanks.  Get the plugs in, please.  Thank you.  Yeah, this weekend, we're going to Thursday.  I played my brother enough.  We've got to play Anthony's brother.  Thursday night, we're going to be at the Red Lion right here in town, the U2 band.  Friday and Saturday night, we'll be at Harrah's in Atlantic City.  Nice.  And Saturday during the day, very big show. 
[04:32:00]  It's the New York Fire Department and the NYPD football game at Floyd Bennett Field,  the Hangar 5 in Brooklyn.  Any other information?  www.notu2.com.  Also, MySpace.  We're on now.  MySpace slash U2 show.  Very cool.  All right.  We've got to get out of here.  We've got an interview to do with the Friday morning quarterback.  Thanks, guys.  It was fun.  That's right.  All right.  How was the show today, Mike?  Great.  Thumbs up?  Just don't write about that Tango and Cash bit. 
[04:32:30]  Yeah.  That could be left out.  Because, look, it was bonus show.  It was bonus show, and we were just trying to show off, and we failed.  And something happened.  I'm sorry.  What's your number one observation from today?  Oh, observation.  I apologize.  Well, this guy knows radio.  He writes for radio.  Friday morning quarterback is a huge trade magazine.  I'm sorry.  Every radio station in America gets it.  Yeah.  And other big wigs in the biz.  Big wigs.  Sorry.  What was your observation today?  There's nothing that you guys do that can't go here that's here that can't go on regular 
[04:33:00]  radio as well.  You guys are just a regular show, guys talking about things that happen out.  Except good old Captain McCunt.  That's right.  I don't think we'd be able to talk about him.  That's right.  The language is what it is, and you have that more freedom here.  But over there, you just watch what you do, and it's the same show.  It's literally the same show minus language.  That is a good observation.  Will you kiss us later?  If only if you hug me.  Johnny kicks.  If only if Jimmy hugs me.  I'm sorry about my bit.  He's huggable. 
[04:33:30]  Remember, it was Jim Norton's bit.  If you have to write about it, it was Jim Norton's bit.  I know.  I'm glad it came right after mine.  Yeah, no one remembers your awful bit.  I completely forgot my car wreck.  I completely forgot my car wreck.  I overshadowed it.  You know, that's the one thing.  And who can remember Ben Sparks' interview at this point?  Oh, my God.  Ben's awful interview.  Wow, we gave a hell of a show.  The last hour and a half.  Three bombs in a row.  Three strikes.  Holy shit.  It really was.  This is a carpet bombing, this show.  Shock and awe of shit.  All the articles written about you guys, Jimmy Gets No Credits, is a full-on member of the show. 
[04:34:00]  I think that's one observation as well.  That's true.  He really should.  If he was here every day, he might.  I am.  I just don't make much of an impact.  Well, you know, people who work with me closely don't even realize I'm a member of the show every day,  so why should other people realize it?  Yeah.  That's just...  You've referred to that a couple times, who?  No, it's not important.  Just, you know, they know.  What are their initials?  Can't say.  CF.  Really?  Cuntfish. 
[04:34:30]  Ben's hog is just big enough for my business.  Well, I do have big tits, God damn it.  God damn it, what nice tits.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday. </pre>
