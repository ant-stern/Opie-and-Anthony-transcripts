<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a listener request segment featuring Jim Brewer's ongoing feud with his neighbor, "Pizza Man." Brewer, present in the studio, recounted a multi-year saga of escalating bizarre incidents, including Pizza Man's erratic behavior, illegal hunting, false rumors, shady business practices (including a poorly run limo service), harassment, and potential mail tampering (leading to federal investigation). A neighbor called in to corroborate Brewer's claims.  This segment was interspersed with advertisements.

Following this, the show transitioned to another listener request: a hilariously bad song, "Dara," by Anthony's former band (either As Is or Finster). The song was played on-air, met with groans and laughter from the hosts.  Joe Cumia, the song's writer, called in, sharing in the embarrassment. Callers joined to further mock the song's 80s cheesiness, and requests were made to remove the song’s YouTube video.  Earlier in the broadcast, a caller named Sam had also recounted his own negative experiences with Pizza Man, further detailing the widespread animosity he caused in the town.  Opie described a tense, silent encounter with Pizza Man at a gas station. Sam also requested the removal of YouTube videos about the Pizza Man saga.

Next, E-Rock hosted a "Listener Request Worst Of" segment.  This included Opie repeatedly playing clips of a Steve Wozniak audiobook, focusing on mentions of the word "chip" to annoy Chip (Jim Norton's comedic persona).  A woman named Erica ("Couch Lady"), a guest in the studio, presented a "lesbian couch" along with antique poker chips and playing cards from her soon-to-close shop. Opie then delivered a freestyle rap about a woman named Dara. After examining the couch under a blacklight, Opie accidentally broke a ceramic dish Erica gifted him, leading to awkward apologies.  This segment also featured Joe Rogan's podcast advertisement and various commercial breaks.

A chaotic incident ensued where Opie threw the gifted poker chips at Erica, causing her to cry and leave the studio.  The hosts reacted with a mix of amusement and horror, followed by much discussion and attempts to mitigate the situation.

After commercial breaks featuring Sirius XM and sponsors (Skechers, Lumosity, Nadex, MissTravel, and Smart Mouth), a "worst of" segment from a Hurricane Sandy broadcast ("Anarchy Radio") aired.  This involved darkly comedic scenarios of post-apocalyptic lawlessness, set to the music of "Gangnam Style."  Callers contributed to the increasingly outlandish tales. This segment included a call from Joe Montana about Skechers and an interview with comedian Joe DeRosa promoting his stand-up special, "American Degenerate," which included his thoughts on circumcision after attending a bris.

The show concluded with Jim Norton discussing his comedic persona, "Chip," its origins, and the varied audience reactions.  Norton recounted bizarre meet-and-greet experiences, contrasted Chip's intentionally bad jokes with other comedians' styles, and delivered a GoDaddy.com advertisement. He discussed his morning routine, proximity to the studio, and compared the Opie and Anthony show dynamic with other radio shows, including Howard Stern's.  A significant portion was dedicated to Norton detailing his struggles with sleep apnea, sleep studies, and the procedures he’s undergone, punctuated with numerous vulgar jokes and references.

It's called a master franchise. With a master franchise, instead of paying franchise fees and royalties,  you receive them from all the franchises in your territory. 
[00:01:00]  Royalties of about $15,000 to over $50,000 per franchise per year to the master franchise owner are common,  with 10 to 100 franchises in a territory.  As a master franchise, you don't have to deal with unit day-to-day operations.  You have low overhead, virtually no employees, and you don't need to leave your current job to do it.  A master franchise is the safest, quickest, and most profitable way to make your franchise fortune.

Welcome back to the Listener Request Show for the Opie and Anthony Show.  My name is Iraq.  I'm hosting this thing.  Sending your requests.  Hopefully, you are to OAWorstOf. 
[00:02:30]  OAWorstOf.  Sorry, OAWorstOf on Twitter.  OAWorstOf on Twitter.  And we're trying to get everything that we possibly can into the little time that we have.  Let's see what we have here.  Going next on the list.  This is from Stephen.  It's, oh, Jesus.  Stephen.  I'm guessing this is your last name.  Galcacy.  G-A-L-G-O-C-Y.  Stephen Galcacy at Twitter.  He wants to hear not just the Jim Brewer pizza man story.  He wants to hear the saga, the complete saga. 
[00:03:00]  Now, this is something that happened over the course of a couple years where Jim Brewer came in talking about having an incident with the guy who runs a pizza shop in his hometown.  Now, this went over, like I said, a couple years where new developments, new updates kept coming, and the story just kept getting more and more bizarre.  So, here it is, strap in, as we're going to try to play the entire pizza man saga with Jim Brewer.  It's the worst of the O.P. and Anthony show.  O.P. and Anthony moving right along.  Look who's in studio. 
[00:03:30]  Our old friend Jim Brewer.  Brewer!  Brewer!  That was great.  That was like some backyard hanging with Norton and Jesse.  Because I do side with Jesse's views a lot.  But I love thinking that stuff.  Love it.  So, I love.  There's times when I listen to you guys and I want to strangle Anthony.  I'm like, you so are why you're sitting next to him.  You're like, are you fucking kidding me?  But I love that shit.  It was great radio yesterday.  Great discussion. 
[00:04:00]  It is crazy of me to just think that some terrorist decided to fly planes into buildings and kill people.  Instead of some wild harebrained scheme that could not possibly be pulled off.  I'm not going to go into it.  I'm not going to go into it.  It's going to be too long.  The five surviving hijackers actually are doing Desperate Housewives in Saudi Arabia.  They're beheading them.  It was a nice hit for the show and Jimmy especially, man.  That fucking Ventura video is everywhere and it's got people talking.  Speaking of which, Brewer called me the last couple of days. 
[00:04:30]  He's like, I've got to come on the show to talk about a certain person in his neighborhood that's driving you nuts to the point I think police are involved.  Lawyers are involved.  I've never seen Jim like this.  Never seen him aggressive and fucking chomping at the bit.  Never.  Dude, I'm going to churches asking fucking pastors to pray for me and shit.  It's that fucking bad.  I'm going, will you please pray for me that I don't do something stupid just because I want to do something stupid. 
[00:05:00]  I would never sacrifice my wife or kids or family, but this guy is such.  What could he possibly be doing?  Yeah, start from the beginning.  First of all, from the minute he moved in my neighborhood, shady.  Shady.  Now you had lived there already.  Lived there already.  Having a great time loving your neighborhood.  Riding bicycles.  Up and down.  Bling, bling.  Fucking enjoying life.  Right.  Avoiding the deer. 
[00:05:30]  Go karts.  A little deer action.  A little.  You got like a herd.  That's not right.  I accepted that part of my life.  Wait, I just figured something out.  Trampolines in the yard.  Having fun.  Having fun.  Hold on, Jim.  Yes.  Eating pies.  Brewer.  What?  Yes.  All right.  But I don't want to.  Yes.  All right.  All right.  I know what's going on.  You've been to the house.  Yeah, go ahead.  Now, this guy.  First of all, he moves in.  I'm just going to call him the pizza guy.  Okay.  And anyone in New Jersey, in the Chester area, knows exactly what I'm talking about immediately. 
[00:06:00]  All right.  Now, pizza guy.  First of all, he moves in.  When he moves in, he moves in at between midnight, two in the morning for like four straight days.  Immediately, I'm like, what?  Red flag.  Big red flag.  Vampire.  I lived.  Nosferatu on the mailbox.  The way, this is the way he introduced himself to me.  I'm in my yard and with my family, kids. 
[00:06:30]  He comes throwing in my yard.  He looks like Al Pacino in Godfather.  He's got this dead-eye, creepy, deaf look.  And he's always got a marble red hanging.  And he talks like this.  He goes, listen, I live across the street.  I was in your yard five in the morning, and I want to spear a buck. 
[00:07:00]  Can I spear?  No.  Hey, how are you?  Are these the kids?  Because of my fucking yard.  I want to spear a buck.  I said, what are you talking about?  What's a buck?  He goes, dear, buck.  I want to spear him in your yard.  I want your permission.  You're the boss, right?  I said, hold on a second.  What?  What is it?  This is my mom.  This is my dad.  This is my nieces, whatever.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bro has a big backyard, just so people know.  And there are herds of deer that just go flying by at different times of the day. 
[00:07:30]  It's three acres.  We're not talking Pennsylvania cow farm.  Yeah.  So with that, I said, no, man.  You know what?  My wife is so freaky into animals.  If she even heard this conversation, she'd slice your throat, watch the blood gurgle out,  and dance in it and laugh at you while you're taking less breath.  He went, well, that's why I ask.  That's why I ask.  So two weeks later, I'm going to have breakfast, and my five-year-old goes,  Daddy, there's a man with a rifle in the yard.  What?  Holy shit. 
[00:08:00]  I said, what?  I look in the back.  There's some guy in camouflage way out in the woods going tree to tree.  And I'm like, holy shit.  My heart's going 40 billion miles an hour.  Now, at the time, I had my nephew who lived with me, who's straight out of the who's go.  All right?  So he's like a human pit bull.  I'm like, no, down, down, down.  I said, stay in the house.  We're going to call the police.  Well, him like a dope goes outside.  Now, I know it's from the pizza man, because only the pizza man could have saw where he was standing. 
[00:08:30]  And the minute he went outside, the rifle guy instantly picked up a phone and he took off.  So he's in, he's constantly talking about his guys.  So anyway, this is a couple years ago, whatever.  They cut to this summer.  Wait, did the cops come or no?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they came.  But the guy was gone.  And this isn't even the incident yet?  Oh, no.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We didn't get there. 
[00:09:00]  First of all, this guy's asking.  What?  Doesn't this guy know about, like, you can't just hunt in neighborhoods?  No, because apparently he's a bag of rocks.  Okay.  He fell off the boat.  Yeah.  He thinks he's 1930s, this jackass.  He can just hunt in the neighborhood. 
[00:09:30]  Funniest sound ever.  There it is, Jimmy.  The Statue of Liberty is going by a black and white.  Pizza Man, make sure you're right to us.  We're going to miss you.  Pizza Man.  So now, cut to, he opens up a pizza joint very close to the neighborhood.  I, every other, Jimmy, a big favor.  First he goes, can you come do show outside pizza place? 
[00:10:00]  I said, what am I, Rich Voss?  Voss, I just entertained.  I don't know.  I'm trying to stop up first.  Take that, stupid.  That's fucking hilarious.  So, it gives you the mentality of the rock of the Pizza Man.  I said, I can't.  No.  I'm going to.  So I go out and I hang out.  He constantly calls me, you know, my kids, my delivery.  They love to, you come here, mean a lot to them. 
[00:10:30]  I go there.  I say hello.  He's got me doing charity.  He scares the daylights out of the neighborhood.  He bullies and barters everybody.  Everyone.  Jim, can I use your fax machine?  I got these faxes from Italy.  I can't understand anything.  Holy shit.  He starts me last summer.  He's like, where are your office at?  In the middle of the street.  Flags me down.  I said, what are you talking about?  He goes, I need your address.  For what?  I open up business.  I need your address.  I said, what a fucking. 
[00:11:00]  What a set of balls.  A set of balls.  I'm not even exaggerating.  You know, anyone in my town will tell you how fucking nuts this guy.  So I go, I don't know my address.  And he goes, you know where you work?  I said, my sister knows him.  Give me your sister number.  I swear to God.  I went, yeah, here's her number.  Four, one, two, six, two, one, eight.  Get out of here, jackass.  So, oh my God. 
[00:11:30]  Cut to.  Holy shit.  Cut to everyone hates this guy.  Everyone's having problems with this guy in town.  That's all I hear.  It's all over the place.  This guy did this to me, did that to me.  And that's another thing.  He's shoving all the other pizza.  He's starting a battle with other towns.  He's like, I'm going to run that guy out.  I go there and I threaten him and I told that guy in Mendum, he piece of shit.  And his car's coming my way and I got to show him.  I'm like, you're going to get whacked.  You're going to get whacked.  Well, cut to this summer. 
[00:12:00]  We go on a big RV trip.  Yeah, totally, totally sold out to the family world.  Love it.  Get my RV.  I'm doing gigs and fucking halftime gigs.  I'm on the road.  I come home.  I hear all this crazy shit.  He's going through this sick divorce to the point where he's turning off the heat.  He's not paying the bills.  Oh, shit.  He pulls up as I'm unloading.  So here's where it begins.  He goes, he gets out of, I, stupid me. 
[00:12:30]  Because I like the guy.  Although he's crazy, I've never had a problem.  You figured he was just a nut.  He's just a nut, but he's never bothered me.  I never had a problem.  Yes.  Except for guns in the backyard.  Guns in the yard.  He tells me, you know, I'm going to, you know, my guys are going to take care of this  guy in Italy because, uh, he taken my grandfather's gun.  And so my, he see what happened.  My guys show up.  But I tell you this, cause I love you like a brother.  This is, he loves everyone like a brother.  You don't want to hear those stories.  No, no.  You don't want to be involved.  So now I'm exploring them. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  So he pulls up and he goes, Jimmy, um, I said, I put my hand on his heart.  Like, you know, man, you need to talk.  I hear all, he looks like Scarface in the third act when he's sitting behind the desk  and he's just, his face is mangled.  I said, Joe, you all right, man?  You know, you all right?  He gets out of the car, lights up his Marlboro Red, which he chain smokes.  He's like, you know, fuck her, my, let me tell you something. 
[00:13:30]  He goes, say, I'm going to bury my wife.  I'm going to, I, you want the house?  Take the house.  You're going to foreclose.  I'm going to leave it.  I'm going to take on my son.  I'm going to bring him to Italy.  She never see him no more.  Uh, I, I don't give a shit.  I don't give a shit.  So he's going on and on and on about these horrible things he's going to do to the wife.  Yeah.  That's always nice to hear witness.  So I'm like, I'm like, you know, you really, you should think about the kids.  He goes, I don't give a shit.  She could have the kids.  I don't give a shit.  I take on my son. 
[00:14:00]  I go to Italy.  I make a $5 million a year.  I got 39 guys working for me.  I got trucks.  I've got this.  But at the end of the conversation, he goes, uh, listen, Jimmy, uh, um, don't take it personally,  but she's going to get a letter and the letter say, uh, you know, the kids, uh, they, they  don't come over the house.  I said, what are you talking about?  He goes, I don't want her to be able to bring, uh, choose you nowhere.  I want her a slave. 
[00:14:30]  So I really don't know what he's talking about.  So now again, you don't know what he's talking about.  I'm really not sure what he's talking about.  And people are wondering if, uh, this pizza guy delivers pizza with cheese in the ring  of the crust.  Jackpot.  Jackpot.  Hence jackpot, right?  Jackpot.  Maybe that's what triggered it all.  You're trying to take him out of business.  See what the fuck?  He saw the commercial and went, motherfucker.  Who does this guy, Jimmy, do the pizza hut?  He's got, I had the idea of the cheese into the crust. 
[00:15:00]  I don't think there's a pizza hut in Jersey.  We're getting, we're getting to a really good part.  Oh yeah.  No, no, no.  It's so good.  Cause he doesn't want his wife bringing the kids over to your house.  He doesn't want to be.  So now I hear the kids are kicked out of camp because someone, you know, she can't have  babysitters and all this just nightmare.  Now I'm starting to hear all these guys in town call me on the road.  They're like, bro, what's going on with you and the pizza guy?  So what you and the pizza guy, I said, well, what's going on?  There's a, we walk in the restaurant. 
[00:15:30]  He tells everyone you're, you're a drug addict and that, um, he's got a restraining order  against you to keep away from the kids.  Holy shit.  Oh, are you kidding?  Are you, please tell me you're kidding me.  He's like, no.  He goes, bro, I wouldn't care, but there were like a lot of costs.  There was customers in there and he didn't know.  And he took it.  This is stupid.  He is.  I did an article to start my new tour and the tour was like, yeah, you know, I used  to smoke pot, but now I'm a family guy and I don't even curse on stage. 
[00:16:00]  Bring your wife and it's going to be great.  So he takes that.  He goes, oh, Jimmy do drugs.  Okay.  Now I get to bury him.  So he takes the article and he shows people and everyone that tells you goes, you know,  this one guy calls me, this is like the fourth guy calls.  He goes, he looks retarded because I read the article three times.  I go, what's the problem?  He go, look, he used, he do marijuana.  He goes, yeah, but he says he used to years ago.  What's the, what are you talking about? 
[00:16:30]  He got, he dead to me.  He dead to me.  So this is what I'm hearing.  I'm not his pal.  Your brother, like a brother.  Yeah, you guys got along.  I'm starting to get annoyed, but now, like a dope, he has no clue.  My niece is in town.  He opened up a limo business, which is like a Harlem living, you know, like the cars you  see in Harlem.  Yeah.  You go to my town, it's like this nice town.  This is white trash limo. 
[00:17:00]  Limo with this guy from Nicaragua dragging, you're going to go to 15, 17, and I'm bringing  you there for $180.  The bumper's not on, right?  It's slightly askew.  I'm not even lying.  There's dense in the car.  Yeah, I know.  We all know the limo you're talking about.  Wow.  So, he starts, she calls, she texts me, and she's like, Jim, this fun guy's talking about  Auntie, my wife.  Like, what are you talking about? 
[00:17:30]  This limo guy, he brought up that he's single because his neighbors are assholes, and the  guy's on drugs, and the wife is crazy and rude.  I said, what's the guy?  I can't say that.  But I went, are you, are you fucking kidding?  So, this is building up inside me.  Now, the wife, they're going through the divorce.  The wife gets a letter from the lawyer going up.  The kids are no longer, here's the letter.  Jim Brewer's no longer allowed near my kids because he's a known drug user. 
[00:18:00]  Holy shit.  Dude.  Sorry.  I'm in a movie theater, like, watching Up or something with the kids.  You junkie.  And, yeah, he probably thinks the movie Up is about drugs.  So, we finish the movie.  Yeah.  Now, we took two cars.  My wife's turning.  She's like, don't do something stupid.  Don't, don't, drive right home.  I can see that look in your face.  I've never, I haven't seen this look in your face since you were 18. 
[00:18:30]  You're like, no, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  I go 90 miles an hour to this pizza joint.  I go to the pizza place.  I'm like, where's, where's Pizza Man?  Uh, he's not here.  Well, you tell him that I'm looking for him because I'm tired of his family bathing in  my house because he doesn't pay bills and he shuts off the gas and there's no electricity  so they have to shower in my house.  You tell him that, Mr. Drug Guy.  All right. 
[00:19:00]  You have him call me.  He never calls.  Never calls.  Well, you're dead to him.  Two weeks later, I'm in my yard.  Having a great day.  Wiffle ball or something?  Yes.  Rocking the wiffle ball.  I had my family, I had my parents, in-laws.  Oh, what a good day.  Beautiful sky.  All of a sudden, his kids come walking to my yard with the wife.  She's like, oh, he's scaring me.  He's this.  I'm like, I don't need this shit.  I don't need this shit.  So my wife's like, you know, stay here.  I pull my wife's like, I really don't want them here. 
[00:19:30]  I don't want them here.  I'm spending time.  Well, yeah, she's fucking having trouble.  Whatever.  Hour later, his kids are playing wiffle ball.  He doesn't even, he's never bought it.  He never hangs out with the kids.  Ever.  Ever.  So all of a sudden, the kids go, somebody's staring at us from the woods.  Holy Jesus, no.  Turn around.  It's Pizza Man.  He's in the neighbor's yard, spying. 
[00:20:00]  So now.  This is like.  Pizza Man.  This is like a bad movie, man.  This is like a horrendous horror movie.  So Pizza Man is in the next yard, spying on my family and his kids.  So the wife is like, why don't you come over here like a man?  You want to see your kids?  You're back in there.  So he starts walking to his house.  So now I'm like, whoa, now we're going to have our conversation.  So I don't think.  Now, everyone that works for him are like immigrants that he literally enslaves. 
[00:20:30]  If you talk to him, they're like, oh, I got to work for him because he's going to turn me in.  We're all junkies.  So I go to him and I swear to God, on a very, very human level, I swear on my kids' lives.  I go, Pizza Man, you want to talk to your kids?  Why don't you go talk to your kids?  He won't look me in the face. 
[00:21:00]  He smokes a cigarette.  He looks down at the ground.  And he's circling around like a hyena waiting for the lions to finish eating the fucking gazelle.  Hey, Mocha Joe.  Pizza Man.  That's interesting.  Very close to a, it's funny you said that.  Oh, okay.  So anyway, I go, listen, you want to talk to your kids?  Go talk to your kids.  What are you staring in the woods for?  He's smoking a cigarette. 
[00:21:30]  I go, listen to me.  I don't care what you've been saying around town because a lot of people coming up to me,  I don't think you realize how many people know me.  Oh, no.  I said, you know, I came in the pizza place looking for you.  You really pissed me off about that drug.  He go, this is what he says.  You got that right.  You got that right.  You had every right to be angry.  I said, well, I don't care what you say about me.  Don't talk about my wife.  He go, what are you talking about?  Now, he's not supposed to have a limo business because his papers aren't done.  He's not supposed to collect the money.  Oh, shit.  So I said, my niece was in the car when you drove her. 
[00:22:00]  He went ballistic.  I never drive in a fucking car.  He gets his finger in my face.  And now I'm thinking, all right, touch me.  Go on.  Now, I got my kids watching.  My parents, my in-laws.  Everyone's like, oh, my God, Jesus Christ, Jimmy, get in the house.  It's like, everyone be quiet.  I ain't afraid it's a little fag, which is what he is.  He's a little fag. 
[00:22:30]  So he doesn't dare touch me.  He's going, who are you niece?  I said, I'm not going to tell you who my niece is.  The fact is, you were in the car, and you were talking about me and my wife.  Don't do that.  You son of B.  I ain't no fuck.  I ain't no fuck.  And I said, don't tell your kids I'm on drugs either, because I'm tired of them coming  over here going, hey, Mr. Jimmy, my daddy said you're on drugs.  So he gets intimidated by me, because I looked him in the eye, and I kept walking up to him 
[00:23:00]  every time he walked away.  So he turns around, and he goes, you disrespect me.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  I said, how do I disrespect you?  He goes, I told you, my kids come in your house.  You send them home.  I said, first of all, stop yelling.  And second of all, don't tell me what to do with my family.  Your kids come over to my house.  I'm not going to tell my kids what to do, and I'm not going to send your kids home.  I go, you got problems with your wife.  You deal with your wife. 
[00:23:30]  Don't involve me in your bullshit.  He goes, I told you.  You know what?  You're going to get it.  You're going to get it on a Tuesday.  And he starts walking away.  He starts walking away like, Tuesday, you're going to get it on a Tuesday.  Now, Tuesday, I'm going to L.A.  And so I'm like, oh, my God, I got to leave this nutball with my wife and kids.  What does that mean?  I'm going to get it Tuesday.  On Tuesday.  It's not called the cops.  I didn't call the cops.  Someone in the family called the cops while this is going on.  When cops come, I get, all I'm going to say is, that's when I got scared. 
[00:24:00]  And they were like, that guy?  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  All right.  They kind of know about him.  Stay clear.  They're like, dude.  So I do my own investigating as he's up for, apparently he's up for assault.  This is what a bag of rocks his jackass is. 
[00:24:30]  Holy shit.  Why are you on our show telling this?  This is great.  This bag of rocks, there's a town pool.  Did you do the noise again for the bag of rocks?  Hey, piece of man, take your bag of rocks.  And remember, if anybody confronts you, you come to mama.  Mama give you a hug.  And mama make you a sauce.  I can come right here with nothing but the change in my pocket. 
[00:25:00]  He's going to leave with nothing, too.  They're calling this Brewer's Lakeview Terrace.  So the bag of rocks.  The cops show up.  Cops go up.  I'm not even going to say what I learned there, but they said, listen, we're going to make a police report.  Did you learn some bad stuff, though?  I learned bad stuff.  I learned bad stuff.  I learned bad stuff.  Multiple bad stuff.  Multiple bad stuff.  Were you scared or angry?  Both.  Okay.  More angry because, especially what happened right after this, this is when I got angry. 
[00:25:30]  This is when my blood level went through the roof.  And so, now, just to give you an idea, this jackass in town, he's up for assault with a deadly weapon.  But it sounds worse than it is.  Right.  Basically, what he did was, this is what a bag of rocks he is.  Some guy came to the town pool, which he bullied himself into.  He literally was sending fish and letters to the guy that had the place. 
[00:26:00]  Can I, can I, can I, I gotta, I gotta help, not, this doesn't need help, but I've been  to Brewer's house in his neighborhood.  This is like the most peaceful.  Beyond peaceful.  It's like the epitome of suburbia.  Thank you.  This is what I got worried about, too.  I'm not gonna.  And you got this guy just like, just threatening everybody.  We live in a place, he had about 50 trees in front of his house.  I used to walk out and stare at woods and trees and chop down every, that's right, three 
[00:26:30]  straight weeks.  He wants to cement the place so bad.  Dude, he's so stupid.  This guy comes to me, living there one month.  He go, Jim, guess, guess what?  First of all, you need to know, you know what they call me?  The Italian Jew.  I said, really?  He goes, that's right.  Because I got Italian and I know how Jew people down.  Now he drives like 90 miles up my driveway.  Get out of the car. 
[00:27:00]  Can't wait to tell me this.  I go, what's up, Pete's man?  He goes, I just bought two horses, two thoroughbred.  I name them Zambuc and Espresso.  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  I swear to my kid's life.  He goes, how much do you think I, how much do you think I'd buy the horse for?  I said, first of all, who gives a shit?  Second of all, Pete's man, I don't know.  How much, I don't know.  He go, go ahead.  Guess one, he thoroughbred.  The other one, he prized wiener. 
[00:27:30]  $16,000?  He go, $5,000 for the both of them.  I said, all right.  Two weeks later, he's burying them in the backyard.  I've got horse flies the size of my pinky fucking up my summers for like the last three  years.  He's got sheep.  He comes in my house.  Probably he just needed the heads.  Probably.  He comes over my house.  He's like, you know, how about I chop down your trees?  Oh, great.  I want to put my livestock here.  I said, Derek, you're not going to Pennsylvania. 
[00:28:00]  You're not going to my house to create a farm.  Are you retarded?  Are you re...  Make sure you take your bag of rocks, eh?  Take your bag of rocks, a pizza man.  Holy shit.  And when people question you, you show them the bag of rocks and say, that's in my head.  Fucking guy.  All right, so the pool.  The pool, he spooks the guy.  So this guy at the pool...  Holy shit.  Now, this is all public records, so I don't mind talking about it. 
[00:28:30]  You can go and check out any police report on him.  Mm-hmm.  The police report is, this is how the bag of rocks, the guy's like, you know, I'm eating  a sandwich.  Leave me alone.  He's going, you take a business away from me.  You can no eat here.  He goes, you know, you can fuck yourself.  He goes, I'm going to kick your ass.  The guy calls a cop because he threatens, I'm going to kill you.  Cops come.  What day did he pencil his death in?  Yeah.  Oh, he's got about 50 guys.  He goes, Tuesday, I'm a busy with the brewer. 
[00:29:00]  I know I do Tuesday, but I come when you are in a Thursday night.  Right after the delivery.  This guy, so the cops come.  This jackass, while the cops are there, already settled the situation.  He goes, no, this is no way I do things.  I show you how I do things.  He goes to his car, opens his trunk, and takes out a freaking police billy club.  So they're like, oh, illegal.  Hands on the roof, bump, in the car. 
[00:29:30]  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  He goes, this is the way I do it.  So now that's assault.  You went to assault.  He's also up for gun charges, too, because that's another whole thing.  So, cut to later that night.  After the cops go, is that the day?  Yes, yes.  So now I've got to leave the next day to L.A., and I'm a little worried.  And they said, we're going to be in your driveway.  Don't worry about it.  He comes down here.  He drives a mile over the limit. 
[00:30:00]  Don't worry about it.  Now, every day, his goons drive up and down my neighborhood.  Every freaking day.  They steal her mail.  Jackass.  Holy shit.  Yeah, we just, I've had federal agents call my house.  This gets good.  Oh, my God.  So now, 1130 at night, my door knocks.  Like, what the fuck?  Over the door, it's the cops.  The guy's got this face like, I am so sorry. 
[00:30:30]  What the fuck?  I said, what's the matter?  His wife was so scared because of his menacing.  We watch him.  In the middle of the night, he'd go knock on the window and just stand outside the window.  Like Cape Fear.  Lunatic.  Lunatic.  Just to control.  He's a sick control freak.  Never touched her, but he's sick control.  He wants to control you.  Mind control.  Mind control.  Jimmy, you know all about that.  Secret society is next on my program. 
[00:31:00]  It's Jim's neighbor, the pizza man.  Now, pizza man.  This is conspiracy.  Well, this is what the cops say.  Oh, shit.  You can't make this shit up.  The cop goes, Jim, we apologize.  The lieutenant said I have to come here because he legally called.  I have to make sure his children are not being kidnapped.  Holy mother of fuck.  But that's the moment I knew he was a bitch. 
[00:31:30]  What a, what a little bitch.  Yeah.  To call the cops.  Did you, you, now you're a bitch.  You just, you just put your dress on and you pierced.  You're a bitch.  You're now, officially, I'm going to send you some makeup.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So now he's like, I'm going to call the cops on you now.  So he sends the cops to my house to harass me and my family.  And so I go, you're kidding me, right? 
[00:32:00]  And he goes, he laughs.  He's like, no, I'm not kidding.  I go, you know, he's, I said, why don't you talk to his wife?  His wife is right here.  She's scared to go home.  And he's like, I don't need to come in.  He's like, I just want to let you know he called and legally I had to come here.  And next time we'll call on the phone.  I said, all right, now it's okay.  This, this better end right here.  This better end right here.  So what happens?  She's now going away.  The wife is going away.  Now, granted, he doesn't pay one bill.  Now he's driving around a white Mercedes all over town. 
[00:32:30]  He's, he's got like 10 cars.  He won't pay a bill for his kids or his wife.  Right, right, right.  He wants to put them in the gutter.  Now all of a sudden the wife gives us like, I'm going away.  He steals my freaking bills, which he does.  I see him go there and pick up his mail every day.  He's got a court order now that says he's not allowed to pick up the mail.  He's not allowed to go to the house without a police escort.  He breaks it every day.  Goes there, takes the mail, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:33:00]  He goes there.  So he asked my, she asked my wife, pick up the mail.  Four days later, freaking, hi, this is, uh, you know, Charlie from the federal mail tampering.  Yes.  Oh, shit.  And, uh, we have a, um, police report saying, uh, pizza man, uh, is, is saying that, you  know, your wife's a suspect of stealing mail.  I went, all right. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, Christ.  So the cops, again, you're a bitch.  You know, she's taking, you know, that's some bitch shit.  I'm sorry.  That's some bitch shit.  You're not even a man anymore.  You're a bitch.  You're a, you're baby.  You got a vagina.  You disrespect him.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You're in hell, bro.  He's in, you are fucking on fire pissed.  Beyond on fire pissed.  I want to, I know exactly where he walks at night. 
[00:34:00]  I know exactly who he's banging into.  Everyone knows who he's banging in town.  Everyone knows everything about this.  This is what made me feel better, though.  I swear on my kids' lives, every human being I bump into goes, let me tell you something  about that pizza guy.  Everyone's got a story.  So when someone does eventually do something to him, he's not going to know who.  He's pissed off Mexicans. 
[00:34:30]  He's pissed off the community.  He's pissed off the, every imaginal person in town he's had a run-in with.  And that made me go, all right, it's not just me.  It's not just you.  I feel better.  I feel better.  You know, a mistake you made, well, obviously, wrong place, wrong time, because you're pretty  close proximity.  Yes.  But also, getting involved in any way, shape, or form.  Helping.  With even helping.  Yes.  You're too nice of a guy. 
[00:35:00]  Correct.  Is what you did.  Correct.  And now look how that pays you off.  Look at how that pays me off.  With a federal, with a Fed coming to your door.  The Fed coming to the door.  And to quote Scarface, look at you now, you stupid fucker.  Right.  So, now we got another, well, the cops call, and they're like, listen, we already talked  to the federal agent, we talked.  I said, well, fuck that.  I want him charged for false police report.  He's not allowed to pick up mail.  So he can't make, he can't make, this is, listen. 
[00:35:30]  The cops are all about it.  They're like, listen, man.  This guy's out of his mind, and to prove that he doesn't know is a whole new, you know,  bag of rocks.  We're dealing with a bag of rocks.  I said, all right.  So now, about two weeks, about two weeks ago, I'm sitting in my house.  This still continues?  Holy.  Oh, dude.  Two weeks.  What's the duration of this whole thing from beginning to now been so far?  End of August.  From the end of August.  From the end of August. 
[00:36:00]  Okay.  Actually, it was like the first week, September, is when, last week, August.  We got three more months to go here.  When it got really bad.  All right.  When it got.  He moved in a couple years ago.  Yeah.  Everything was great with this guy.  Until he started telling me what I need to do.  Right.  Don't tell me what I need to do because you're banging everyone in town and your relationships  in the dumper.  It's not my problem.  Yeah.  I'll help you.  I'll even take care of your kids like better than you take care of them.  Apparently.  See, his kid came over yesterday like, my daddy bought me a private jet to go to Orlando. 
[00:36:30]  Like, you're kidding me, right?  I said, oh, that's exciting.  He's like, yeah, he's bringing my mama and he's saying, you know, he's going to steal  me.  Oh, that's nice talk.  Your father's great.  He taught me how to shoot gun.  Oh, that's a good dad.  It's a good pizza man.  It's a good class citizen.  Good class act, that guy, that pizza guy.  So.  So you smooth things over with the federal agents.  Yeah.  Federal agents, no problem.  Okay.  Car drives by my neighborhood, pulls in my neighbor's yard, pulls all the way in the 
[00:37:00]  backyard.  I know it's not pizza man's.  I know it's not any of his guys that work for him.  I call up the wife.  I say, you expecting someone today?  Someone just pulled the neighbor.  Who pulled my neighbor?  Call the police.  I said, it looks like a, it doesn't look like a menacing car.  Why?  And I go check.  I'm on the phone with the wife.  I go stay on the phone with me.  I walk back.  No one's in the car and she has a barn in her backyard, a little barn, like a garage. 
[00:37:30]  And it's just the door shut.  No one's back there.  That's a little odd.  I'm like, what?  I go, let me give you the license plate and then I'm going to call the police because  I don't know where these people are.  While I'm talking to her, the barn door opens.  Two of his guys are there.  One's about six foot four.  Jello is about two foot five.  And, and the big guy goes, hey, how you doing?  I said, good.  Everything cool?  He goes, yeah, I'm just feeding the animals.  And he was.  He had animals. 
[00:38:00]  He was feeding animals.  At least what I saw.  Cause he was, he was hiding behind the door.  So I said, all right.  Oh no.  So I tell the wife, I go, he's feeding animals.  They're feeding animals.  It's very legit.  She's like, my animal, those animals must be gone.  He's back in court.  He's feeding animals.  I walk away.  I go to my house.  I watch them drive away.  I said, drive away.  I wave.  I got no problem with them.  Ten minutes later.  Oh no.  Jim, can you tell me what happened about, you know, it's a sorry.  Can you tell me what happened about ten minutes ago? 
[00:38:30]  What do you mean?  What happened?  I don't know.  What happened?  He goes, well, I need your side of the story.  What story?  What are you talking about?  What happened across the street?  Oh, I'm thinking the wife called the police.  Uh-huh.  I said, well, this car came in and you pulled the backyard.  I went there and I was there and I was on the phone with her the whole time.  And they said they were feeding animals.  And that was it.  That's what I, all right.  That's all we need to hear.  I hear him in the background going, I want him fucking charged for trespassing. 
[00:39:00]  He, he, he, he, he threatened my workers.  He threatened my workers.  He was, he's a bitch.  Threatened.  He's up at the, he's up at the police department.  He wants you locked up so bad.  He wants me locked up.  Yeah.  What a, what a watcha.  So he's at the police department.  There's a police report.  It says, it's really funny.  In the police report, it says, even though we explained to pizza man over and over again,  there's no trespassing. 
[00:39:30]  There was no harassment, no threats.  He insisted that we arrest him.  And I mean, the lawyer are going to do some.  So as you do, he sends me a letter.  I wish I brought the letter today.  I, I forgot the letter on my counter.  It looks like a third grader wrote this.  It looks like a third grader wrote this.  I start showing everyone.  I'm like, you want to see something funny?  Now, can I legally say the lawyer's name that sent it to me?  I wouldn't say any names.  Yeah.  Okay.  I would say.  All I'm going to say is the lawyer is obviously a guy that he went to. 
[00:40:00]  He's like, can you, can you, I'll give you two slices of pizza.  You write this letter and just say lawyer.  Dear Jim Brewer, I am going to sue you.  Yeah.  Your lawyer's, your neighbor's lawyer, Frank.  Yeah.  And it's, I mumble through that.  That was so funny.  Yeah, and it's basically like, this is Rocco.  You, my client pizza man, my client pizza man needs you to stop harassing his employees and you need to stay away from his children. 
[00:40:30]  I understand there's a court order that says you're not allowed anywhere near his children and you know you are going to reap the consequences.  So, today, I, you know, I finally, I'm like, you know what, now I got to, now I got to call the lawyer.  And now you got to fucking.  So, now I called a guy and so we just launched our missile and it came today. 
[00:41:00]  Now, I could legally read my letter, right?  Yeah, I just wouldn't say it.  Why not?  Just don't say anything in his name.  No, no, I'm not going to say it.  I'm not going to say it.  It's actually pizza man.  It says it on the, uh, no, bag of rocks.  When we sent, when, dude, I'm telling you, I showed this around town, everyone, I showed  it to a lawyer and the guy laughed and he went, this ain't a lawyer.  This is a jackass.  And so, when we found out, my lawyer goes, you know, he's listed under a real estate  guy.  He goes, he's technically a lawyer. 
[00:41:30]  He is a lawyer, but he's like a meatball, this guy.  So, you would, you would enjoy this because these guys hand him down like a, oh, I certainly  would.  Yeah.  So, like, just, this guy's a beast.  Yeah.  He's a beast.  He's got a beast.  A real guy.  A real lawyer.  Yeah.  He's a beast of a lawyer.  Even, even, I wish I had the wording.  The wording.  Going against the guy that's a part-time lawyer.  My lawyer.  He is such a good lawyer.  I give him a tomato sauce. 
[00:42:00]  When you have barn animals, honey, baby, it's hard to convince me that you're feeding  them.  I love that term for a good lawyer, too.  A beast.  Yeah.  He's a beast.  So, here's where we're at in the Battle Royale.  And you know what?  At the end of the day, I wanted nothing to do with this.  Right.  And this jackass just keeps pulling me in.  You got forced into this whole situation.  I got forced into this.  Yes.  Yes.  So, here, I'll read the letter.  Ready?  Here we go.  Dear Mr. Jerkoff, we represent Jim Brewer and are responding to your letter, whatever 
[00:42:30]  the date.  We're unclear of your intentions in sending the letter and do not fully comprehend the  ambiguous threats contained therein.  In order to insist us in advising our client, please provide us with copies of any court orders  served upon Mr. Brewer, which in any way purpert. 
[00:43:00]  I don't even know what that word is.  Purport.  Purport.  I think maybe further the cause of or further the thought of, that's just a guess.  Thank you, Jim.  I could be totally wrong.  No, I think you're right.  Purport.  Show.  But if they show.  Yes.  Correct.  Yeah.  That purport to restrict his activities.  While your client appears to be going through a difficult divorce, I'm unaware of my, of any  orders, orances, or restrictions upon Mr. Brewer's constitutional right to associate with 
[00:43:30]  anyone, including his neighbor, your wife, which I won't say the name, which I know right now  his blood is boiling.  Pizza woman.  While Mr. Brewer would rather not be drawn into the marital hostilities, your client's apparent  paranoia and actions including verbal and physical threats, trespassing, spying, and assaulting 
[00:44:00]  behavior have required frequent police intervention and cause great concern with the Brewer family.  Unless the court orders to cure my ignorance of any applicable fees, we see no choice but  to retain local counsel in order to obtain injunctive relief against Mr. Pizza Man, continuing harassment  and threats towards Mr. Brewer.  What does injunctive relief mean?  It's not good. 
[00:44:30]  It's basically, it says, this is the streetwise.  One more fucking letter with this, if you fucking threat my guy one more time, in the fucking  oven you go.  In the oven you go.  In the oven.  You hear me?  One more phone call, one more, in the oven you go.  So that was to his lawyer.  That's his lawyer and to him.  Good.  Because the lawyer will understand, even if he's not a legit lawyer, he'll understand the  awful implications of that.  Oh yeah.  He's going to try to sell you a mortgage.  My lawyer actually tried to, he's like, Jim, do you really want to pursue this? 
[00:45:00]  I'm like, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because it doesn't end here.  Now you're pissed.  Yeah.  It doesn't end.  It's not going to end here.  No.  You know, it's going to be one day where I'm playing in the yard and his kid touches my  grass and I got to worry about this fucking wacko doing something stupid.  No.  I want him, everything I could do, full blown assault.  Done.  You have to set up a barrier of protection around yourself.  But however, if you love to have his pizza, search him in town, I'm sure you would love 
[00:45:30]  it.  Yeah.  It's fantastic.  Good pizza, huh?  It's not New York pizza.  It's not Giuseppe's pizza.  It's not Roma's pizza.  It's not, let's see, Roma, New York pizza, Napoli.  It's not Napoli.  Uh, not Giuseppe's.  But if there's another pizza place somewhere around, which was, I believe, voted like number  one.  This is.  Wow.  Yeah.  Voted number one in the county by his best friend that he paid off. 
[00:46:00]  So yeah, that's the world I've been in.  That's a great story.  And while I'm doing that, I bring my dad to get some relief.  Yeah.  Who's 86.  I bring him to the, like, let me get my dad out and a little family time.  I'm sitting there in 15 minutes.  These guys come over to talk to my dad.  And they're like, yeah, I got a World War II hat on.  And blah, blah.  We want to take you out.  And that's the time.  And you know, where I've been?  I've been here.  Blah, blah. 
[00:46:30]  And they're like, yeah, we want to take Atlantic City.  Get something good to eat.  What do you like eating?  Cont.  Oh, he said that.  Yeah, the lady beheading.  That is it.  Wait, you got the name?  That is it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That is it.  Somebody had it.  Yeah, a few people had it.  Somebody popped it right up on the board there.  So feel free to go there and have great conversation with him to know that.  And ask him, like, hey, how's it going with the bills and your new private jet that you're  burying your children with?  Isn't he a nice class act citizen, this guy? 
[00:47:00]  That's great.  That is a great story, man.  Dr. Steve, by the way, this guy knows everything.  Injunctive relief.  Gaining satisfaction through legal means, i.e. by injunction, which is kind of what we  assume.  Thank you, Steve.  So anyway, all that leads to I'm playing Albany.  Oh.  Got to pay those lawyers enough.  This is the worst of the open entry show.  Sirius XM.

Why don't we get an update on the Pizza Man, because everyone's asking.  Dude, let me tell you something about Pizza Man.  You know a guy named Sam?  I know a bunch of guys named Sam.  He says he's one of your neighbors?  He's a neighbor?  Yeah.  Because he wants to talk about Pizza Man.  I'll let him talk about Pizza Man.  Let me hear about Pizza Man.  And you have a Pizza Man update?  Yeah, sort of. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, Sam.  What do you got, buddy?  Hey, bro, it's your neighbor.  We were the guys with the party trailer for your birthday party.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What do you mean, the party trailer?  I had a block party.  Yeah.  And I didn't do it 100% right, but I had an idea for the block party.  And the block party was, I wanted to take it over.  I said, I want to have a full-blown movie theater for the kids, which I had, where a truck was going to come for $300. 
[00:53:00]  During the day, the kids play Game Boy and rock, you know, on the back screen.  On the back of the truck?  Yes.  No, and they set up those blow-up screens.  And so while that was going on, I had a band at the end of the block for the adults and karaoke.  I also had an ice cream truck coming.  Some of the other neighbors, they meant well.  But they're like, no, we can save so much money.  And once it came down to money, that's what's like, if I'm going to pay $25, $30, why don't we pay money?  Whatever. 
[00:53:30]  I knew I was taking a hit anyway.  I was willing to drop a couple grand just to put the neighborhood together.  So with that, someone said, no, no, no.  My computer can link up and we can watch the movie and a thing.  I said, okay, all right.  You be the head of that.  You be the audio video guy.  And I can get free ice cream.  Okay.  P.S.  Cut to four in the afternoon.  They're all wasted.  And I got every kid in the neighborhood go, where's the movie theater?  I said, talk to Mrs. So-and-so. 
[00:54:00]  Mrs. So-and-so has been missing for five hours.  So the movie theater never, never happened.  And neither did the ice cream because they got drunk and forgot about it.  Although they're fun as hell.  So all the kids are like, we never got our ice cream.  We never got that.  To this day, they're like, fuck.  You never showed the movie?  You clearly said on the flyer, movie, guitar hero, and ice cream.  And you dropped the ball.  I'm like, all right, well, whatever.  But this guy showed up, Sam showed up with his pickup truck. 
[00:54:30]  And he had this big freaking, like, plasma-looking screen.  And he was watching movies all night.  And you could tell the next time I got to collaborate with him.  He knows how to figure this shit out.  He knows how to figure it out.  Right.  So what's up, Sam?  Hey, bro.  I just wanted to let the listeners know, you know, the last time when you talked about Pizza Man,  you know, I thought my family was the only family that actually had problems with him. 
[00:55:00]  I just found out, like, the entire town had problems with him.  And your story is pretty much dead on from what you were explaining for an hour about him.  And, you know, just a warning.  I mean, even though you have no trespassing signs for no hunting on your property,  that doesn't stop Pizza Man and his buddies.  Let me tell you.  Do tell us a story.  Did you, was he hunting on your grounds?  There was one day I was sick and I didn't go to work.  And, you know, suddenly I hear this knock, knock, knock, knock, knock on the door. 
[00:55:30]  I'm like, who is this guy?  And it was him and his buddy.  And, you know, I told them they weren't allowed to hunt because, you know, the neighbors,  you know, obviously we all banded together with the kids being around.  Of course.  Children, neighborhood, three-acre lots.  No shooting animals.  Lots of deer come running through, though.  Non-stop, yes.  I've been there with a herd of deer that's going to go further than three acres.  Yes.  Go to Pennsylvania.  It's a half hour away.  Right, yeah.  Go to hunting parts. 
[00:56:00]  It's all over Jersey.  But it is tempting when you see a whole herd of them.  No, it's really not.  It's really not.  Then you, and I told the Pussy Man, Pizza Man, Pussy Man is a Pussy Man because anyone  that wants to hunt a deer that's 10 feet away, you're a pussy.  That takes away hunting.  It's like tackling a five-year-old.  What's the thrill?  I can get the kid.  You're a fag.  Yeah.  You're a fag.  A real hunting is you've got to go up in the train, wait for the suck. 
[00:56:30]  You don't kill it in the backyard.  Fag.  Go hunt squirrels.  All right, I'm venting.  Go ahead.  It's true.  Yeah, well, they were after this 12-point buck that was running around in the neighborhood,  and the guy really, really, his friend, it was actually his friend that really wanted  this buck.  Yeah.  And, you know, and I could have sworn they had some firearms in the car.  I'm like, what are these guys trying to do?  You know, they're trying to go after this one deer that's been rolling around.  For $50, for $50, that's a pizza man, I guess $55 for the horns. 
[00:57:00]  I said, you know what?  You're partially retarded.  He really is.  So anyway, long story short, you're right, the whole town had a problem with pizza man.  Pizza man is that bad neighbor.  Sam, we'll try to get something together this week.  All right, Sam.  Now, last time you were on the show, you talked about pizza man for an hour.  We can't get into that again, obviously.  You go to YouTube.  Let me tell you something.  Yeah, the story is up on YouTube.  I don't know how many people have, I have not seen it, but I can tell you my entire 
[00:57:30]  town has seen when I came up here and talked about pizza man, and this is where it started.  It started with me going to a little convenience store, a little place called Crousers.  Oh, fuck yeah, Jersey, very Jersey.  Yes.  Very Jersey.  Yes, Jerry.  I go into Crousers, and there's a guy there, Nelson.  Nelson, who used to do something with the pizza man.  I'm not quite sure what he would do.  I think pizza man does everything cash and sneaking behind the doors. 
[00:58:00]  So pizza man, I walk in there.  A cop.  I hear from behind, so what's going on with pizza man?  Now, I turn around.  I'm like, how do you know about pizza man?  He goes, oh, we've all watched that 4,000 times.  He goes, we need to know, who's the lawyer? 
[00:58:30]  Who's pizza man's lawyer?  I tell them the lawyer, and they're like, let me tell you something.  That guy's had his bar's license taken.  He's an old man.  I feel bad for him, because pizza man manipulated him, blah, blah, blah.  And so they tell me a story that pizza man is, and I think I told it, was going to be tried for a dumb incident he made.  He bullied his way into the town pool.  Right.  You told that?  I told all that.  So I'm not going to go into it again. 
[00:59:00]  Two days later, I'm in the grocery store.  Not one, but about four people come up to me.  I'm down the aisle, and this lady comes up.  She goes, can I just tell you about pizza man?  I went, you know about pizza man?  She goes, can I tell you?  You know what my teenage daughters did last week?  The whole weekend, she had a slumber party, and I hear them laughing and laughing.  And I thought they were watching, like, really bad art movies.  I went downstairs.  They were watching you telling the pizza man story on Opie and Anthony, and they did it until four in the morning. 
[00:59:30]  She goes, everyone in Mendham, Chester, everyone knows about the story of pizza man.  You find the clip at EROC for the people at home?  We got a bunch of new listeners the last month or so.  It's in four parts, because it was so long.  It's in four parts.  It's over an hour, yeah.  It's almost at 30,000 views from, well, I can tell you 25 of them are in my town.  It's not bad for an audio clip on YouTube.  And what, just Jim Brewer, pizza man? 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Pizza man or pizza guy, it's labeled both.  With Jim Brewer, though, right?  And so he now, so what happened after, we left it off where lawyers, blah, blah, blah, he sent some cheesy lawyer.  I think we left off where he sent the letter, and then I sent the letter.  He sent another letter.  And in the other letter, his dopey lawyer wrote, he took a piece of paper. 
[01:00:30]  Like, when you get a divorce, I don't have to tell you, you make arrangements to have them killed.  You know, I agree that you have to pick up the kid on Wednesdays, and you're not allowed to come here,  and the kids are not allowed to be alone here.  So in it, the mother and the husband, pizza manor and the wife, agreed not to have the kids alone with just me.  Which, quite frankly, I never want that anyway. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Why would I want to be alone with someone else's kids?  Period.  So, he takes that part of the article, the agreement between it, and he pastes it to, so it looks like it was ordered by the court.  A court order.  And he sends it to me in this threatening manner.  Again, like, you will, the consequences, we're going to have to take action against you, and blah, blah, blah.  Uh, so now, I send the letter to the lawyer, and the lawyer, my lawyer, again, animal, animal, they own record companies. 
[01:01:30]  This is, this is not rocking, this is enjoyment for them.  Yeah, yeah, fun.  And, the guy laughs, and he goes, I, I can't, I, never in my life have I seen a lawyer toy with papers.  We're going to have to take his bar's license away.  We're going to go after him, because he legally toyed with legal papers.  How could they tell him, did he do it in a photocopy it, or was it actually? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, like, it will say, like, the court order, and then they'll put, and the only, and then  it was a paste of just what they agreed to in typing, and then it made it look like, uh,  ordered by the court of, yeah, that's how stupid he is.  That's how stupid.  Okay, a bag of Roxy, a bag of Roxy for you, and a bag of Roxy for your lawyer.  Yeah, so, they send, uh, my lawyer sends him, and says, um, I'll have you know that 
[01:02:30]  I'm very suspicious that you toyed with legal papers, and we're going to have to now legally  go after you, and your client, and your bar's license, everything.  They called the next morning.  We are so sorry.  This is a big misunderstanding.  Uh, I, I don't legally know what's going on with Pizza Man.  I don't represent Pizza Man.  Uh, you will never hear from us again.  We're sorry for any inconvenience.  They knew they fucked up. 
[01:03:00]  We are so sorry.  Never want to hear.  So now.  Fuck Pizza Man and his ass.  We hate fucking Pizza Man.  Yeah.  So now, lawyer calls up.  He's like, great news.  I heard from, uh, Pizza Man.  He goes, and I gotta be honest with you, he is as dopey as you explain him.  He goes, just acts, everything.  Everything the way you said is hilarious.  And he really is a bag of rocks.  So, I go, well, I want to go after him now.  I want to go after him for harassment. 
[01:03:30]  He goes, listen.  Listen.  If you drive by, it gives you the finger, he looks at you the wrong way, but you call,  and now you can go after him for, just leave it.  He's done.  You're never going to hear from him again.  Well, I didn't hear from him again.  However, a couple days later now, everyone in town is going, oh my God, I watched that  Opie and Anthony Pizza Man thing.  We have Pizza Man parties.  We drive by his Pizza Man place.  We know exactly that. 
[01:04:00]  And stories.  Stories are coming up.  People going, did you know that I treated Pizza Man's horse?  And the other horse died and he got killed because he was malnutritioned.  And Pizza Man, and I had people that worked for him start emailing me going, you know,  Pizza Man threw a bottle at my head.  I'm only 16 years old.  Pizza Man curses.  He got in a fight at the park.  He fought here.  Fucking legendary.  Everywhere I go.  They have a Pizza Man story.  Someone has a Pizza Man story and how much they hate Pizza Man. 
[01:04:30]  He screwed me here.  He threatened my mother.  He bullied my grandfather.  He came in here.  He started a fight.  Pizza Man can lick it.  Nobody likes Pizza Man.  Nobody.  They hate Pizza Man.  So with that, convenience store up in the corner, I am now getting gas.  And as I'm getting gas, Pizza Man comes in.  Oh, shit. 
[01:05:00]  And Pizza Man, me and him lock eyes.  And I stare him down.  And he now goes and parks the car to get coffee.  So I'm like, oh, you know what?  I'm done getting gas, but I can use some coffee.  What an asshole.  So how do you like your coffee?  I get out of the car.  I go right next to him.  I don't even say a word.  I'm just standing right next to him. 
[01:05:30]  And he's looking down the counter.  That's what Pizza Man does.  He never looks you in the eye.  He's looking down the counter.  And he goes, hey, hey, Jim, how you doing?  I don't even answer.  So I go to get my coffee.  He goes, no, don't use that one.  That one, no good.  Use that one.  And I'm just staring at him.  And so he pours the coffee for me and puts the coffee in front.  And he never says a word. 
[01:06:00]  I never say a word to him.  So now he won't get online.  So I just pick up the, now the whole time, I'm, I mean, it's right back to Jefferson Avenue, Long Island, king of the block.  You're going to feel my wrath now.  So now I'm online and I'm just staring at him.  And he won't get in line.  And he's just, he's circling his coffee.  I wait till I leave.  I'm about to leave.  As I'm leaving, then he gets in line.  I go, you know what?  I'm not done.  I want to, I got to get cash. 
[01:06:30]  I forgot I got no cash.  So I go back in the cash line.  He's then, he's looking at me.  I'm staring back at him.  I walked out the door with him.  I walked him all the way to his door.  He got in the car.  I looked at him.  He never looked at me.  I watched him drive away.  And that was the last I've ever dealt with pizza, man.  Not a fucking word, huh?  Not a word.  Now I don't look at him.  He don't look at me.  Oh, he's still in the neighborhood.  His house is. 
[01:07:00]  He's not.  He's not.  He's up the street, sort of.  His establishment still works.  His establishment.  And from what I heard from rumors, I can't officially say.  But he hasn't taken care of financial needs to his family.  Ah.  Yeah.  Well, deadbeat action going on.  Correct.  I didn't say it, Anthony.  I believe you just did. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, of course.  And the courts are now after him.  And the court, now he went to court, supposedly, and said, I'm losing money because of the Opie and Anthony Jim Brewer pizza man.  Oh, yeah, great.  Yeah, sure you are.  I think you were losing money long before.  This is how dopey he is.  He put in the article that he was retiring his pizza plate.  He's retiring.  So he can make us three million and walk.  And then he didn't retire.  And so, long story short, I can't wait to pizza man as a long guy. 
[01:08:00]  I never want to see him again.  I kind of feel bad for him, but I don't.  It's heading that way.  He's going to have to leave the neighborhood for good.  He doesn't go anywhere, and nobody likes him.  It's sick.  It's strange.  Nothing worse than when you start feeling sorry for someone you hate so much.  I feel bad for him.  And just watch them fuck shit up so bad for themselves that you're like, I kind of feel bad, but I don't want to because I hate them.  Yes, and to be honest with you, the minute that blessing was coming on here and talking about it, because the minute I left, people came out of the fire department, police department, people in ShopRite, people at the bagel store, people at the other pizza places, people from soccer teams. 
[01:08:30]  He had a fight on a soccer field, people from the pool, the entire town.  If you go to have dinner, the waiters, the freaking, the church, you go to church, and they're like, I believe in Jesus, but Jesus would hate this son of a bitch. 
[01:09:00]  Everybody had a story of how they cannot stomach this individual.  And the minute I started hearing how, even the place where I go get gas, they go, let me tell you, this bastard did, I mean, I'm, my feelings are kind to him compared to what the entire town feels about this man.  And they don't even know he's deadbeat.  They don't even know that he's deadbeat.  And he was driving around in a white Mercedes while he's not paying his children anything. 
[01:09:30]  So it's like he's, wow.  But anyway, like I said, it's off, I don't care anymore.  Or whatever.  He's got the whole town to deal with.  I'm the least of his concerns.  I want to go to your town and get a pizza man sighting.  Dude.  Now I feel like I need to see him.  Do you want to come this week?  He'd be a celebrity.  You come this week?  Yeah.  He'd be a celebrity.  You come this week.  Go see, and I'll tell you what, you know what kids start doing?  I shouldn't say this, but I should say it off the air.  I guess I have that story, because I was saying bag of rocks. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  Often, as a present, little bags of rocks were left.  Oh, shit.  Those little sightings.  It's taking on a life of its own, pizza man.  It's really sad, though.  All the guy has to do is just be a regular guy.  There you go.  Just be a nice regular guy.  Stop being a dick.  Stop being a dick.  You're a dick.  Stop being a dick.  How hard is that?  Just don't be a dick.  What an amazing advice, though.  Just stop being a dick.  Stop being a dick.  That's all it is.  That's what it comes down to.  You know, again, I was probably his only ally he had. 
[01:10:30]  You guys started as sort of friends, although he pushed his way into your life.  No, he pushed his way into my life.  But even then, I understood him.  He's off the ball.  He's a bag of rocks, all that jazz.  Bag of rocks.  I respected him, but he came after me.  I mean, he came after me.  All bets are off.  Especially when he went after my wife.  And like, are you a sick individual?  Now all bets are off.  And a lot of people out there are a little confused.  You've got to check out the original clip.  You've got to check out the original clip.  When Jim Brewer came in.  It's in four parts on YouTube. 
[01:11:00]  You have to look at it.  It's an amazing story.  They had pizza man parties in my town.  I'm not even kidding you.  My pool man.  The pool man came and he goes, you know, we're going to Atlantic City and we're having a pizza  man party.  I swear to God.  They go and have pizza man parties.  They watch the YouTube piece and they drink and they hang out and they laugh at pizza  man.  Isn't that hilarious?  Can you imagine a whole town just like that?  Awesome.  Just because you're a dick. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, whatever you want to do.  Yeah, whatever you say.  You know, it's weird going to every show, the Anti-Social Network.  And everybody comes up to me and goes, pizza guy, pizza guy, pizza guy, pizza guy, pizza  guy, pizza guy, pizza guy.  I've never seen anything like it.  Um, I actually, we requested for, on, on behalf of, uh, I had a great conversation with Jimmy 
[01:12:00]  and, uh, because he, I don't want to give him any more fuel, but, uh, he, he's, he's  a little, he's a little off.  He's a little off.  And, um, I actually asked the listeners if they can take down the YouTube piece just  to cool his, cause he's, uh, we had a run in, we had a couple of run ins and I don't  like the, uh, the tone of the run ins. 
[01:12:30]  Really?  I'm not worried for me.  I don't like how my family was approached when I wasn't around.  Oh.  And I, you know, I don't want to give him too much credit, but, uh, both sides have made  their point.  Both sides have made their point.  You've made your point.  He's made his point.  Right.  It is what it is.  Right.  Um, it's like Jim said what he had to say.  The other guy said what he had to say.  You move on.  Right.  That's all.  And right.  And it's, it's over and like to move along. 
[01:13:00]  Um, I'd like to move along.  Well, you know what the torture thing, when it's over, you made your point.  It's almost like you don't have to torture a guy with it.  You made your point and then you just, you go forward and that's the end of it.  He goes forward with his thing.  You go forward with your thing.  Right.  Good.  And, and, uh, I thought we were all moving along, but, uh, there was a bizarre little incident.  Oh.  It didn't, it didn't, uh, it alarmed me a little.  And so, and then when I had a run in, I see that a lot of his fuel is from the YouTube piece. 
[01:13:30]  So I'm like, you know what?  He don't need that in his life.  It's just like Jimmy said, we came to a fight.  I came to swing hard.  I swung hard.  And, uh, that's it.  I'll take my robe off.  And I'll let it be.  I'll reflect back in the day.  Remember that fight you had?  Yeah.  I remember.  Good time.  That was a good time.  Good fight.  Good fight.  So, uh, if any of your listeners are kind enough, it would help me out tremendously. 
[01:14:00]  If you're just like, you know what, just, we'll take it down for you.  Yeah.  And hopefully they'll listen.  That's a request.  It's the right, it's the right thing, man.  And it's, it's more of a family thing, man.  It's really.  Yeah, you want to, you know, if you were just alone, fuck it.  Correct.  You're a single guy?  If it was just me, I really, I would be worse. 
[01:14:30]  Probably be in prison.  Or someone else would be.  Yeah, yeah, true.  For, you know.  But everyone thinks about their family.  Jim thinks about his family.  I'm sure that guy thinks about it.  With his family, it's like everyone's got their family at stake.  So it's like, you don't want your family hearing bad stuff about you.  Jim doesn't want his family.  You know what I mean?  It's like, move on.  It's done.  Right.  He had little kids.  He still has little kids.  Great little kids.  And we'll get into a better side of it as time goes on.  Sure.  If time, oh man, boy, I'd like to unleash. 
[01:15:00]  But just can't, all I'm going to say is like, it would help the cause if that was just taken up.  Fair enough, man.  That's not a bad request at all.  No, no.  No.  I've requested certain things to be taken down.  Brewers been, I've been a trooper over the years.  It's time to call in a favor.  That's all.  I'm just calling in a favor.  A favor.  A favor.  A favor.  After the years of empty fucking-tainment.  He'll perform at your pool party this summer for you. 
[01:15:30]  I got great.  Off the air, I'll tell you some great stories.  You have a Pizza Man update, I heard?  Here's the Pizza Man update.  For the people that have been following that saga.  Let me.  It's too long to get into now, so just give the update.  Here's the update.  We're going to court.  I don't know.  I so badly just want to give the court date and all that so people can come watch.  People show up.  Because you can go to a court and watch.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But here's the interesting thing. 
[01:16:00]  He's got two court dates that day.  Two different scenarios.  Oh, for two different things?  And because it's open, our court date is in about a week or so, and it's for him aggressively following my wife.  Jesus.  With the kid in the car and an infant in the car, which he has done before. 
[01:16:30]  Not with my wife, but with other women in town.  Maybe he's making a delivery.  It could be.  And I think that's his defense.  I died delivery before.  So.  15 minutes or less, right?  So at the end of the day, that will be, you know, will be done.  And you know what was really amazing was, my wife wanted nothing to do with it.  And she went, I don't want to give him the, I don't want to give him an ounce of energy and to think that he scared me. 
[01:17:00]  And of course, this is your wife and your kid.  And so the thoughts through me were not very pleasant.  So.  Oh, shit, man.  I actually found, I, dude, you know, I'm in a good place.  I literally said, you know, if I come across him, I will talk to him like a man, try to hash things out.  Well, I literally saw him.  Oh, no.  Pulled up alongside of him. 
[01:17:30]  And as God is my freaking witness on my kids' lives, this is how it ended.  It ended me by me going, you know, what did you think, at this tone, what did you think was going to happen following my wife?  And he goes, takes a drag of a cigarette and he goes, you know, you wife, she go, but she a liar.  And you're going to have to prove I was in the car.  I don't even drive a car that day. 
[01:18:00]  I said, listen, listen, you know, like a 14-year-old boy stomping his feet.  You will never get into it.  I said, I've caught you in lies before.  People will catch you in lies all the time.  My kid was in the car and then he looked at me and said, was she a liar too?  Oh, fuck.  And so that's when I just went and he stuck his hand out to shake my hand.  Oh, my gosh.  And I said, you're shit to me. 
[01:18:30]  You're a faggot.  He went, faggot?  Faggot?  I said, yeah, faggot.  Get out of here, faggot.  And he started pulling the car away and I said, you know, you live at home and mommy?  You go, muah, muah, muah, you go on your boobie and go back down.  And so that's how it ended.  But he means nothing to me anymore.  He really doesn't.  He's, I realize it's not even just me.  It's everywhere.  This guy has got to go into court with him.  These people go into court with him. 
[01:19:00]  He's in court.  He's trying to get his guns back that the cops confiscated.  So it's an ongoing thing.  He's in the next town now doing what he does there.  And good riddance to him.  God bless him.  I wish him nothing but great things.  But I mean, how's the pizza?  From what I heard, you'd have to ask the customers.  How many people do you have to get in the courtroom to hit bonus?  It would be kind of cool if people were there. 
[01:19:30]  And I'm sure some may show up.  Because all you have to do is look up.  It's not going to be hard to figure out where we're from.  And the other cases, from what I heard, well, it's open.  The other cases, the police caught him, caught him, fake police reporting.  Where he called the police, said he don't know where his wife is, and he fears his children are missing after he just hung up with her.  And so they went to the hat. 
[01:20:00]  The cops went looking all over.  They're making out the reports.  Fucking phone records.  What's wrong with you?  And so what they did, though, is they said they finally got her.  And she's like, I've been talking to him all day.  Said, give us your cell phone.  Found all the phone calls.  Found all the conversations.  He's dead meat.  He's done.  I'd like to see what he...  I think there's...  I'm not going to lie to you.  It sounds like...  It sounds like there may be a... 
[01:20:30]  I would say there's a drug addiction.  No, Anthony doesn't follow people.  But I...  It sounds like a blow addict mentality.  Yeah, you don't know for sure, though.  No, I don't.  I absolutely do not.  But I...  You really don't know for sure.  I have no clue.  But because, again, like my mom, I don't know where...  Where does your mentality...  There's so much you can do.  Just make your pizza.  Enjoy your customers.  Enjoy life.  Enjoy your children.  Why create so much drama? 
[01:21:00]  Why?  No one cares about it.  Just enjoy your life, man.  Get on with your life.  Get on with your life.  Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen.  I feel like something is happening.

We are now up to a request from David at DaveVandamNet.  That's interesting.  On Twitter.  And he requests the time that we played the song Dara by the ever-popular band As Is, spelt with Zs, starring Anthony and Joseph Cumia.  This was during a segment that we were doing called Embarrassing Tape Day. 
[01:26:00]  And this is what Anthony had brought in.  And Joe is on the phone as we listen to the masterpiece that they crafted titled Dara.  Dara.  Whatever.  By the way, we do have a copy of a certain song that Joe Curry dropped off last night.  I can't really think it is.  It is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is probably.  I haven't said the name or anything.  It is probably one of the most embarrassing moments in band history. 
[01:26:30]  How embarrassing.  And I said I was going to disavow any knowledge or any involvement.  You wrote it.  And I want you to fess up right now because I am just the vocalist.  You are the guitar player in this.  And you wrote the damn song.  Hey, come on.  You know what?  Bon Jovi was huge back then.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I think it was more like a very 80s sounding with the keyboard. 
[01:27:00]  And I think I tried to put a little Duran Duran wine in my voice.  Now I just pour wine down my throat.  Try to kill the pain.  It's good for you, Pop.  It's good for you, Pop.  What are you guys airing that piece of shit?  Right now.  Right now.  Stay on the line if you can.  Right now.  No.  I'm just going to lower you in the mix a little bit.  Yeah.  Try to stay quiet and listen.  Joe, I'm lowering it for a minute, but we'll go right back to you.  Oh, wait.  Joe, you have a setup for this song? 
[01:27:30]  If I'm not there when you come back to me, you know why.  That's the setup.  That's the setup.  I guess the band was going for a love ballad.  Yeah.  The setup for the song is, well, I was taking flying lessons out of MacArthur Airport.  There was the daughter of this flight instructor that I was absolutely smitten with.  And that's pretty much what it is.  I wrote a song to impress her.  I'm coming down to a gig, so I wrote it in a pinch. 
[01:28:00]  Did it work?  No.  And we moved on from it, but you actually talked to Paul McGinnis?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, I actually, yeah, we got...  Holy shit, I can't believe that one.  I'm a massive U2 fan, always have been, even though the last few have been a little rough  a few years, but...  Oh, we had to get permission to play down in Orlando to play Disney World.  And that was the only way we could get it was by getting him to sign off on it.  Holy shit, that's awesome, congrats. 
[01:28:30]  All right, back to the song, I'm sorry.  Oh, boy.  That was just stuck in my head.  And now I want to preface.  Okay.  Again, I have to preface this, because you motherfuckers are going to take this in the context of,  you know, it was recorded yesterday.  More years have been in front of me after recording this song than were before me.  Well, why don't we just say the year?  Doing this song.  What year is this?  This is in the 80s.  It's early age.  I was out of the Army for, like, two years, so it had to be 82. 
[01:29:00]  Wow.  Yeah, this is very early to mid-80s.  The sound was, that was what everybody was kind of doing.  We're talking 30 years.  Dude, this is a 30-year-old.  We're talking Mubarak just went into office.  Right.  We're talking Anwar Sadat was barely dead.  Right.  He was still warm.  Still warm.  I can hear it in Anthony's voice, because it sounds like he had no nuts.  I mean, his voice was noticeably higher back then.  Yeah, a little higher, although my range is better now. 
[01:29:30]  What were you, like 25, 26?  Yeah, right.  I was a mere child.  And Joe wrote this song.  I sang it.  I believe Mike Klotz is playing bass.  Mike Klotz on bass.  Louis Graziano on the drums.  Is the drummer.  And Plankfoot playing keyboards.  Joe Curry on the keyboards.  My brother is backup vocals.  And, of course, great guitar.  It has the obligatory guitar lead in this song, of course. 
[01:30:00]  It has harmonies, and vocals that are so mushy.  And lyrics are so...  Douchey.  Douchey, mushy, lovey-dovey.  They do not reflect my feelings now, which I would write a song saying,  Suck my cock, you fucking whore.  That's what I would write now.  I hear a lot of excuses.  Let's just hear it.  Yeah.  I'm sure it's good.  I wanted to preface it first.  No, dude, I'm sure it's good. 
[01:30:30]  What's the name of the song?  I know.  The name of the song is the name of the girl.  It is just called merely Dara.  Oh!  Ted Bundy didn't apologize this much.  He fucking played a thing.  And a cute...  It's the longest set up in the history of Bad Bits.  By the way, a cute story.  Stand by for boiled shit.  We were playing a gig.  We were playing a gig, and there was kind of an altercation going on at the door. 
[01:31:00]  By the bouncer and some chick.  And the chick is yelling like she wanted to get in, didn't want to pay the cover charge,  and she's causing a fucking problem.  And me and Joe Curry are standing around, and I was like, you know, what the fuck is this bitch?  And he goes, oh, that's Dara.  Okay.  So, this sweet fucking, you know, love ballad is to a flaming cunt.  Oh, great.  Flaming.  They all are.  Oh, no.  Okay, hold on.  Dara.  From 1982.  From 1982. 
[01:31:30]  I gotta cover up.  I can't.  I am literally covering my face now with my shirt, because I can't fucking watch or look  at anyone.  Joe, and Joe, what's the name of the band?  The name of the band was Finster.  No, I thought this was As Is.  No, this was, oh, you know what?  You might be right, Anthony.  As Is with Z's.  Probably.  Of course.  Okay.  Of course.  Why wouldn't it be?  All right.  Here's Dara from 1982 with Anthony on vocals.  Oh, no.  I'm not looking at it.  And Joe, who's now a big, huge star on guitar. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  It was off a tape.  It was off a cassette tape.  So, relax.  That's right.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  It doesn't really matter.  This is horrible.  Someone once told me.  God.  Oh, no.  When you love the game, I want you to a ring.  You never feel the same.  It doesn't matter.  It came to me for the start. 
[01:32:30]  It took you to scatter the pieces of my broken heart.  And my knees turned into seamless nights.  I can do anything.  I tell you, baby, it ain't right.  You're feeling rejected.  Oh, no.  And it starts you through the way I see you.  Did you pause it for one second?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, look.  Shut up.  There are endless nights.  We've all had them.  Your heart was broken. 
[01:33:00]  Dara broke your heart.  I knew Jimmy wouldn't just let it play.  That's not bad.  Oh, God.  It's so gushy.  Why?  Disgustingly fucking generic garbage.  What do you sound like?  It's driving me nuts.  We need someone that knows their 80s shit.  It's got a Boy George kind of a toy.  Boy George?  Yeah.  Mixed with shoving Jack LaLanne's lifeless cock into a juicer.  Otto will be at comics at Foxwoods tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, God.  I'm literally sweating.  I'm sweating.  Why?  Are you still thinking about Dara and how she broke your heart?  You didn't.  I sweat.  You had endless nights.  Yeah.  Did you record that in a studio?  You should have been arrested for trespassing.  People are asking if me and Joe were back-to-back singing the vocals.  Long hair?  You had the long hair?  Oh, well, I'll have the, you know.  But it's a mix between an 80s new wave band and kind of like... 
[01:34:00]  AIDS.  AIDS.  Thank you, Joe.  They're calling you Aunt Laban.  Aunt Laban coming in for Mike in Woodbridge.  Did you have a bandana tied around your mid-thigh hanging down?  And a couple tied around the mic stand?  Yeah, yeah.  I did have five multicolored pastel-colored belts.  Oh.  Each one a little looser than the next. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, jeez.  Were you guys...  I swear I did.  Ew, they should have all been around your neck.  Were you guys...  Is Joe there?  People are complaining that they've just been ant-rolled.  E-Rock saying it sounds like wham.  You have the photos.  You have the promo photos of that.  There's promo photos for as-is.  Oh, no.  Are there?  Send them in so Aunt can tweet them.  Oh, God.  You got to tweet that shit, Aunt.  Oh, God.  I got to get that. 
[01:35:00]  I got to get that.  So did you write the lyrics while Joe oiled your butt?  Sounds a little like...  Were you guys...  Were you guys hoping it would make a John Hughes movie?  Put it this way.  At the time...  Yeah.  I never thought if we ever got radio play with this song, it would be like this right  now.  I was really hoping for something a little better.  It's Hump X from Whack Bag, Men Without Dignity coming in.  Anthony goes to Hollywood.  Someone just wrote Paul and P.A. 
[01:35:30]  You've got the top.  You've got the power.  Dude, you know how your heart was broken?  What are you going to do?  You sing about it.  That's what you do.  You write like a power ballad.  Steven S. from Bayshore, A Suck of Seagulls.  We were a little more old because I was getting into what happened with this man's journey.  Stop judging him.  Just give me something, something to love me through the bad times.  Then one thing, I've always needed you. 
[01:36:00]  And this needs turned into seamless nights.  I give you anything, I say you really did right.  Only hope and pray that you will see.  I'm going to talk to you.  Come on, baby.  Stay with me, O'Darrel.  O'Darrel.  Oh.  You sing your love about me. 
[01:36:30]  I'm still made out of my romance.  Oh.  Ew.  He should have been singing O'Darrel.  O'Darrel.  You look like Vincent.  Vincent the Chin over there, shielding your fucking shameful face.  Did she save the final dance for you?  The fact that Jimmy said we should have been singing.  I'm literally puckering.  My asshole is puckering.  The fact that Jimmy said we should have been singing O'Darrel. 
[01:37:00]  Because this is so gay.  Oh, man.  It's fucking...  But, you know, you wanted to save the last dance for you.  Oh, dude.  What are you, fucking Tom Cruise?  And you ran in the rain to go to your prom?  This is so bad.  Oh, wait a minute.  Keyboard player Joe Curry checking in on text.  Oh, God.  And?  He just put his hands into a meat grinder.  Retribution.  Oh, let's see what the...  You know, hey, look, look, if you've got to get a positive out of this thing, the harmonies  were okay.  Think about it.  Just take everything else... 
[01:37:30]  There's no positives out of this thing.  Except for everybody's blood.  Joe Curry says, I have promo photos.  30 years.  Wow.  And we finally get this shit on the radio.  Wow.  Wow, this should have been a hit.  Every Dara...  Both Daras in the country.  Would have loved this.  Dara.  Maybe you can update it.  Oh, the wand.  Oh, shit.  I, uh...  Oh, no.  I knew this would be really bad.  It's not that bad, though. 
[01:38:00]  I mean, Dara was going to save that last dance for you.  I understand that.  People think this is an air supply tribute band.  I just tweeted a picture of what Ant looks like as we're listening to his old song.  Yeah, yeah.  I've seen pedophiles walk into court prouder than he is right now.  I can see the picture.  This sounds like Haircut 100.  No, they were warm.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, oh, Dara.  You know what happened?  Ba, ba, ba, ba, say the last dance for me. 
[01:38:30]  I don't think the last dance was being saved.  What was it?  It was something about romance.  Ro, what was it?  What was it?  I hope we'd have a fine, yeah.  I'm sure we'd have a fine romance.  You sure you weren't singing through a hole in a fucking restaurant area singing a bromance?  I didn't know Ant and Joe were rock set.  You'd have a fine romance?  Yeah, yeah.  Apparently that missed the line.  That's a good lyric.  Dan S. in Toronto.  Kaja, Kaja, boo-boo. 
[01:39:00]  Kaja, boo-boo.  And then UCF Gavin in Orlando.  Sounds like culture flub.  What happens next, though?  This chorus is getting me.  Can we hear the whole chorus again?  Yes, guys.  Yeah.  I gotta hear the lyrics.  You'll hear it again and again.  Listen to the words.  We don't know when to stop this fucking mess.  Oh, man.  Oh, hopefully you can't play a guitar lead. 
[01:39:30]  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Oh, good.  What's that for one second? 
[01:40:00]  Did you say time is the healer?  I thought I heard fate is the dealer.  Can we rewind that?  That couldn't have been what he said.  I must have misheard that because time is the healer.  You have to say what you said to Anthony.  Hey, you wrote it, faggot. 
[01:40:30]  Wait, but fate is a dealer.  You said it.  This is turning brother against brother.  Wow.  If your ears could fucking hang each other, they would.  So you didn't have to hear this.  Wait, let me hear that line again.  I want to make sure.  That was a pretty good one because fate is a dealer.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Time is a healer.  Don't let it get you down.  We're fading from the dealer. 
[01:41:00]  Others will come around.  I keep on saying.  Soon I'll be over you.  But then I keep praying.  Oh.  Praying that you want me to.  All right, we got it.  Endless days, sleepless nights.  You have that now because you drink till 6 a.m.  And you're fucking.  You're killing me.  Oh, fuck.  This is so bad.  Why?  It's not. 
[01:41:30]  It's just, you know.  I can't take this.  It doesn't get better over here.  And you don't pray.  Spanky 1684 on Twitter.  Tears for queers.  Oh, praying that you want me to.  When's the last time you prayed and it wasn't over a toilet?  I swear I'll never drink that much again.  And Conway Tweedy, he writes, flock of seagulls shit.  Oh, the 80s. 
[01:42:00]  It's quintessentially the 80s.  It's 80s.  It's hair band, though.  Yes.  There's like a, there's, they're bridging the gap between the two genres here.  Sure.  I can't believe ever being that talentless we've gotten as far as we have.  I can't believe it.  That is just fucking awesome.  Yeah, but you know what?  It says they picture me doing a slow motion roundhouse kick in the air.  In the video.  What is Dara doing in the video?  Oh, hopefully fucking getting an abortion.  That's just having a miscarriage. 
[01:42:30]  No, she's probably walking out the door.  Or she doesn't like you.  She never liked you?  Oh, yeah.  So I'd be rejected.  You could take this song and put it to Steve Perry's O'Sherry video, and it would fit perfectly.  Oh, probably would be.  No, because they loved each other.  Maybe you're standing outside holding flowers in the rain, and they're wilted while she closes  the door.  Someone says in the video, Dara's flying into a bridge abutment in her plane.  Maybe she's walking with a Paula Poundstone, like, pantsuit, because it's 1982, and that's 
[01:43:00]  what chicks wore in videos.  They're calling this song, Oh Diarrhea.  Let me go to Rick in El Paso.  Rick?  Yeah, just done docking.  I knew this was going to be bad, but this is so painful to live through.  Lyrically, it's really good, though.  I mean, you hit a lot of emotional home runs.  What was the stage outfit all about? 
[01:43:30]  Was it a Mike Reno thing?  Where were you at?  Did you have Japanese shit?  Zippers?  Where were you?  Yeah, they were, you know, parachute pants, maybe a shirt with some Japanese lettering  on it.  No headband.  No headband.  You want a lover boy.  But, you know, multicolored belts.  Cut-off shit.  What color belts?  Oh, like one red one, a yellow, purple, green, fucking...  And one was...  What is that? 
[01:44:00]  That's the song.  Joe just drove into a fucking river.  Joe's recording something right now that's better than the song.  All right.  Yeah.  Nothing.  So wait.  And it's a bad phone.  You had multicolored belts.  Joe call back.  And you wear them on your thighs?  No, no.  I would wear them around my waist, but one would be, like, worn, like, the right size.  And then the next one would be maybe one too loose, so it would hang on one side a little  lower.  Is that how the Hulk kept his pants on when he got bigger? 
[01:44:30]  That's a fucking horrible idea.  Five belts in case, what, you're turning to Bob Kelly overnight?  They were different in size.  Yeah.  They should have been.  Different colors.  I don't know.  This ain't bad, right?  I mean, you know, if you told me this was Duran Duran or any of those other mediocre bands,  I would think, you know, I wouldn't have...  It sounds, you know, recordable.  I don't know.  But the embarrassing part is that it was ever me.  But see, honestly, what makes it worse is that 30 years have gone by. 
[01:45:00]  Yes, yes.  30 fucking years have gone by.  If you were in the moment in the early 80s, okay, we'd still be beating you up, but...  But that was the soundback.  Put it this way.  If I was still trying to make it doing this music, then just fucking hang me with my multicolored  belt.  It would be sad and tragic.  That would be sad, but I mean, I had to search out my buddy Joe Curry to find this on a cassette  tape in a box of shit, literally shit, and a transfer. 
[01:45:30]  I mean, this shit is just part of what was going on.  Even though you were talentless, you were driven.  At least you made something down on the track.  I didn't just want to, you know, knock tin and install above-the-ground swimming pools.  Can I put the bat signal out for CokeLogic?  Oh, for what?  Make a video?  I think we might need a video today.  If you can make an animated...  I think we might need that, Dara.  CokeLogic, yeah.  CokeLogic on Twitter.  Let's bother CokeLogic today. 
[01:46:00]  That would rule.  We need a Dara fucking video.  Animation, actually.  Yeah.  One more Dara.  This is good.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Only halfway through the song.  Oh, thank God.  Jesus.  I can do anything.  Anything.  I tell you, baby, it ain't right.  Only only way that you will see.  I'm on the line, you get up.  Come on, baby.  Stay with me.  Oh, now.  Oh.  I've never had a chance.  Oh, come on.  Send your love. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, come on.  Just send it, my life.  We should have a fine romance.  Oh.  We should have a fine romance.  Fine.  Fine.  Fine.  How's your romance?  Fine.  Fine.  Yeah.  That was the original title of the movie with the Tarantino Road.  Fine romance.  Oh, God.  You know what you are?  You're killing me.  You are a drip.  What a wet end.  Oh, God damn. 
[01:47:00]  That's your romance.  Oh, this really is.  You know, Dara's close to 60 probably.  Dara gives a shit.  It's a busted police now somewhere, yeah.  With no teeth.  Yeah.  It's like a fucking trailer park somewhere.  You're going to Hollywood, dog.  I've heard better sounds in a paint toilet.  Dara became a hoarder.  Yes. 
[01:47:30]  I picture people with mullets and fanny packs dancing to this.  Yeah.  Anyone who's been dumped by a girl named Dara is really, this is going to resonate.  Oh, God.  Look, I fucking warned you that it was really bad.  Too bad it wasn't 40 years earlier, you could have been singing O'Clara.  Maybe Phil Rizzuto would have signed up because that was his stupid wife's name.  How many times are we going to hear that in a fucking Yankee broadcast?  Boo, Phil.  Oh, God. 
[01:48:00]  This is so bad.  I can't take it.  It's only proper that you suffer.  I guess that's it.  I'm joking.  I liked it.  Oh, no.  There's more.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, no.  Now the refrain.  Now I'm just crying.  Stop it.  Why?  Stop it.  Oh, damn. 
[01:48:30]  Burn it off.  Burn it off.  Take the boys.  Is this where we got to get our lighters out?  Yeah.  Are you singing with a clenched fist and your eyes closed all fucking emotional?  And I have the mic stand rocked back at about a 45 degree angle.  Oh, God.  Horrible.  I'm clenching my fist and fucking like, oh, God.  Oh, Dara.  You smarmy bag of douche.  It's horrible.  You never met Dara.  Fuck Dara.  I know.  There is no Dara.  She's some drunk trying to get into a club. 
[01:49:00]  Danny just put up the final scene of The Breakfast Club.  The Breakfast Club, yeah.  Yeah, with the fist raised in the air.  Oh, how awful was that?  Speaking of awful, my opening act this weekend, John O'Rourke.  John O'Rourke.  No, a very fine performer.  He's on the building.  He'll be singing Dara.  I promised him a plug.  He will be singing Dara.  I'm telling you, Otto and George comics at Foxwoods tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  Five shows Otto's doing up there at Foxwoods.com.  I'm going to queue.  Let's just try to keep the salty language to a minimum. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  I don't go for that.  Yeah.  More?  Oh, God.  False ending.  80s false ending.  Yeah.  Stay tuned for the drums.  Because it wasn't enough.  All right.  All right.  Oh, God.  I just heard what that was.  Send your love my way. 
[01:50:00]  I'm sure we'd have a fine romance.  I'd have more respect for you if you said, take out your cock.  I'm going to drop my underpants.  Someone's saying in this day and age, I should sing O'Hara's.  That was a good one.  I missed your name.  Sorry.  Oh, my God.  O'Hara's.  O'Hara's.  Oh, God.  The instant feedback and the Twitter is spinning like a slot machine right now. 
[01:50:30]  The amount of feedback coming in is...  Look, I told you.  I can't even keep up with it.  I warned you.  I prefaced it.  And still, I can't take it.  I am fucking so hot.  I'll say.  You were back then, too, with lyrics like that.  I'll say, honestly, though, like, if she had sent her romance his way, honestly, it probably  would have been a fine romance if O'Hara...  Why?  I can't wait until you bring yours...  You could be celebrating your 30th wedding anniversary with O'Hara. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  With a house full of fucking shit.  And she'd see what your love was all about.  You know, she sent her love your way.  Because endless days equals sleepless nights.  And fate's a dealer and a fine romance.  You're really picking up on the lyrics.  Oh, yeah.  Actually, Dara would have divorced you and taken all your as-is money.  All my as-is cash.  That's right.  That's right.  What about how Dara would feel about Keith the cop fucking leaving shits in your toilet?  It worked out for you, yeah. 
[01:51:30]  What about how Dara would feel about girls who have to be ID'd when they walk in the door?  Fucking showing their clits as fucking FBI agents are coming by.  That's great.  Oh, Dara, I'm sorry.  I came on that 14-year-old in the pool.  Send your love my way.  I'm a fool.  You made it.  Is it over?  Oh, God.  Jesus. 
[01:52:00]  All right.  All right.  Wow.  Oh, did you say I know it's so real?  I don't remember.  Now we're freestyling.  Oh, yeah.  Rock it.  Wait. 
[01:52:30]  I have a question.  Because obviously you're saying it's real.  And understandably that Dara should want to spend some time with you.  Yes.  Just to see how you feel.  This is shit.  Why should she?  Like, if a girl doesn't like you, spend some time with me.  See, she knows it's real.  She's not interested.  Oh, I don't know.  She's fucking somebody who sings better, like Yoko Ono.  You know, it was like Feliciano, you got no complaints. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, the big ass.  Oh, God.  And this is where all the guys in the band, they come on the cracker, and then the lead 
[01:53:30]  singer eats it, and the video fades out.  So you can see how I crunched it.  Oh, fuck, man.  What a delicious touch.  That was really rough.  I am like fucking, I feel like I've just worked out.  I'm tired.  Oh, God.  I'm sweaty, and I'm on the brink of anxiety.  I know I'm a fireman, ran back into Tower 2. 
[01:54:00]  Holy shit.  He's playing in the courtyard, Dara.  Anything to get away from that.  Otto and George will be at Comics at Foxwoods tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  Foxwoods.com.  That song was so bad, everybody's going to Egypt now.  Oh, Chip.  I can't even make fun of Chip.  Why?  I knew a girl named Dara.  Yeah?  You got that to fall back on now, which is good.  Which is nice. 
[01:54:30]  Well, now it's part of radio history.  Now it's out there in the fucking ether.  Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen.  I think something is happening.  This is the worst of all being at today's Sirius XM.  The Baltimore Ravens are Super Bowl champions.  You've waited over 200 days.  Adrian's inside the 30, 20, 10.  Touchdown!

I am hosting this thing for you.  Taking your requests at OAWorstof on Twitter.  Sadly, that's the only way we're doing it. 
[01:59:30]  We're moving down the line here to, who is this one?  Chow.  At Chow number three.  Chow the number three on Twitter.  He's asking for the time Opie tried to kill Chip by playing excerpts from the Steve Wozniak audio book.  I think because he says the name Chip a lot in it.  Well, we'll find out as Opie tries to kill off Chip here on the Listener Request Show.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  So, I brought in this little part of the book, Steve Wozniak, talking about the microchip. 
[02:00:00]  What's that?  That changed how we all live.  He was talking about what?  Don't get him going.  We all know what it is.  Yes.  It's the micro.  Microwafer.  Microwafer.  Exactly.  Here's Steve Wozniak.  Chips.  What's that?  Chips.  Chips.  What's that?  I never had the courage to ask Chip Chips.  What's that?  Steve Jobs.  Free Chips.  What's that?  Chip Company.  What?  Very few chips. 
[02:00:30]  What's that?  20 chips.  What's that?  Which is very, very few chips.  What's that?  Chips I had.  That's right.  A few chips.  What's that?  Ram chips.  Ram chips.  What's that?  Beat chips.  What's that?  Use the chips.  What's that?  Including chips.  What's that?  Chip.  What's that?  Chips on.  What's that?  The chips.  What's that?  Chips.  What's that?  Chips went bad to those chips.  What's that?  Registers.  Chips.  What was that?  They do, right?  What's that?  What's that?  If I could use chips, the amount of chips, 
[02:01:00]  put a few chips together,  and use a crystal clock chip,  28 chips for the wrong design.  Wow, that's amazing.  I never knew that.  What's that?  The fewest possible chips.  What's that?  Higher and higher in chip count.  What's that?  Approaching 200 chips.  What's that?  Thousands of little chips.  What's that?  Wire chips together.  Steve would wire the chips together.  What's that?  Connecting chips with wires,  wires, chips, and everything.  What's a chip?  A normal digital chip.  What's that?  A chip that works with ones and zeros,  not waves.  And you spun this chip around  with one little digital chip. 
[02:01:30]  What's that?  The whole thing used 45 chips.  How did you do that?  What's that?  They were paying us  based on how few chips I could do it in.  Really brilliant to put that kind of stuff together.  What's that?  Only now all the CPU parts  were on one chip  instead of a bunch of chips.  What's that?  Like memory chips.  How they're doing this?  A CPU on one chip.  What's that?  And mine had a CPU  that was on several chips.  What's that?  Or another processor like it  and some memory chips.  What's that?  Which really was just a glorified bunch of chips.  Chips with just a few chips.  What's that?  A couple of other chips.  What's that?  Read-only memory chips. 
[02:02:00]  What's that?  Chips that hold their information  to get a ROM chip.  What's that?  It just seems like it's really difficult.  What's that?  It just seems like it's very difficult.  What's that?  It's very difficult to do this.  What's that?  The fact of this chip was so easy to get  of what the Motorola chip was cost me.  Chuck Peddle was heavily in the chip.  What's that?  What's that?  It don't make no sense.  What's that?  The majority of my chips  were RAM chips.  What's that?  And two interface adapter chips.  What's that?  I used sockets for all my chips.  What's that?  I hate this fucking gut.  What's that?  Don't mean nothing to me, Chuck Peddle. 
[02:02:30]  Fuck you.  What's that?  What's that?  These programmable read-only memory chips.  Two of these P-ROM chips that were available.  These chips would hold my monitor program.  How long is this take?  Fucking good.  This guy's really smart.  What's that?  I borrowed 32 SRAM chips.  What's that?  These chips inside their sockets  with all the chips in place  to burn the program into chips.  I can't listen to this.  What's that?  I studied the chip's data sheets.  Here was a computer with 30 chips on it,  having so few chips.  It was like the same amount of chips  on an Altair. 
[02:03:00]  We're talking about a new memory chip,  which would have 4K bits per chip.  The first-time silicon chip memory  would only take eight chips  instead of the 32 SRAM chips  with as few chips as possible.  I had selection chips,  vertical counter chips  of the two of these selection chips  and maybe another chip or two worth of logic  get a DRAM chip.  4K bit DRAM chips for sale  at a reasonable price.  But he got me Intel DRAM chips.  I had to add a couple more chips  to my computer, 
[02:03:30]  but the Intel chips were physically  so much smaller than the AMI chips.  A smaller-sized chip  with the fewest chips.  If I was trying to get chips  for a computer I'd designed,  if I used chips by Synergetics,  the computer had fewer chips  than if I used Fairchild chips.  What's that?  Which Synergetics chips I'd use.  What's that?  The Synergetics chips I'd use  in the design  were much larger  than the equivalent Fairchild chips.  What's that?  Not simply fewer chips.  From designing for fewer chips,  usually fewer chips 
[02:04:00]  means fewer connections,  but not always.  add a couple of extra chips  to go with Intel's chips.  What's that?  Because that chip design  eventually became the standard  for all memory chips.  What's that?  I'm just saying it now.  I don't even know who's calling me.  What's that?  What do you want, Ma?  Ma, you're not supposed to do that  with those that talker.  Ma, what's that?  You're fucking sitting on it.  I'm like this.  Ma, what's that?  What's that?  I feel like I'm dreaming of something.  It's not a matter of buying more chips. 
[02:04:30]  What's that?  The Apple II would be designed  with colorability on those chips.  Oh, what's that?  In doing this,  I knew I would save some chips.  I fucking hate that book.  What's that?  The Apple II ended up  with half as many chips  as the Apple I.  What's that?  Why is he saying this?  By now,  I had faster DRAM chips.  What's that?  These new chips  can do it twice  every microsecond.  Oh, God.  This little blank board  with chips on the top side of it.  There wasn't a single chip  I could save.  I know, what's that?  I was so impressed  to meet him  after the roll of his chip  showed him how many chips  and how it worked  and everything  that was making a chip  that was compatible  with... 
[02:05:00]  They said that any ROM chips  we had around  connected to a ROM  or PROM chip  on the board  with just a single PROM chip.  But 22 or so chips.  What's that?  About 20 of them  weren't needed.  I stripped out  20 of their chips.  I did this  using two chips.  What's that?  One chip was a register  and one was a PROM.  What's that?  And saving it  to the master  8-bit chip register.  What's that?  And put in  the exact same chips.  What's that?  And had us add chips  that you do have  inside the chip.  That's because the chip  didn't already have  4-bit microprocessor chip 
[02:05:30]  with transistors  on a chip.  What's that?  Memory chips.  What's that?  Wow.  So...  That was fucking good.  Let's hear that again.  That was fucking great.  This guy.  Just a minute,  ladies and gentlemen.  I think something is happening.  This is the worst  OPN3 Series XM.  This is Cal Rip.

[02:10:00]  at OAWorstOf on Twitter  where it's your chance  to send me something  that you want to hear  and maybe,  just maybe,  we'll play it.  Or have the time to play it.

She drove a couch  all the way down  and brought some extra gifts  for everybody on the show.  Here it is.  It's the worst  of the O.P. Anthony show.  Well, we got Erica  in the studio.  Hello.  It's Couch Lady.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  So what's the deal?  You were supposed to be here  last week with the couch? 
[02:11:00]  Yes, and unfortunately,  I had a little  incident.  What?  Incident?  Oh.  Infection?  No.  In what?  I don't know.  I guess I had anxiety  last week.  Oh, you had an anxiety attack?  I had an anxiety attack.  Is that why our porn stars  had to have lesbian sex  on a piece of fiberglass?  Is that what it was?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  So I was going to wake up  really early in the morning  and talk to me.  Wait, are you the same girl  that was just sitting out there?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was just wondering. 
[02:11:30]  Because there's other girls  that have been walking through.  I guess he was a little confused.  There's another girl  sitting next to me  that's blonde.  Oh, okay.  I called you.  There's a bunch of people  out there now.  Oh.  I get you.  Yeah.  What's your name?  Erica.  Erica.  So you own a furniture store?  Well, we had an antique  consignment shop  from furnishings  and we have a bunch of stuff  that we had.  You're the same girl  sitting right there.  Yeah.  I called you.  Huh.  Are you married?  No.  Oh, nice.  I don't know.  Getting married.  Oh, not nice.  Did you tell us more 
[02:12:00]  about the furniture store?  It's closed.  I thought it would make  a good addition  It's closed  because you oversleep?  to the book guy  we just listened to.  No, it's...  Why did it close down?  Economy's not good.  No.  And you oversleep a lot?  I'm going down a crapper,  so...  Yeah.  And I what?  And you oversleep a lot.  I heard you had a problem  last week.  He gave me something  for anxiety.  Hey, come get back on mic.  Knocked me out cold  and I just did not wake up.  Really?  Wait, who gave you  this medicine?  My doctor.  Right.  And so you had some anxiety  and he gave you something  to make you sleep? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, he goes,  here, take one of these.  I'm like,  What were you anxious about?  I don't...  Well, things and...  Yeah?  Just things.  Whatever.  And I took one  and knocked me out cold  for like 12 hours straight  and I...  Same girl, huh?  It worked.  You weren't anxious  for 12 hours.  Yeah, exactly.  There's something  about this glass.  Kind of works.  That's what I'm thinking.  Oh, the couch is coming.  Oh, here comes  the lesbian couch  that Erica brought in.  We're having a ceremony.  Do we have any,  you know, music  that we could play?  We should have thought  ahead of time.  Lesbian couch music, Hopi. 
[02:13:00]  A little Katie Lang.  What, do you want a polka?  I think there's like  a heart filter  on that glass or something.  I'm going to...  A what?  Like, you know,  in the heart videos.  Ugh.  All right, where's the couch?  Very nice.  Jim's on the lesbian couch.  You bet I am.  You want to explain  what the lesbian couch is  for the people at home?  You're the expert  on couches.  It's just a love seat.  Probably from the 80s.  Yes, it is a love seat.  From the late 80s.  Late 80s?  Probably late 80s. 
[02:13:30]  Only the best  for your pals,  Opie and Anthony.  Early, I don't know  exactly what year.  Any stains on it?  No, it's clean.  It's clean.  Where was it  all this time?  Yeah, where was it  for 20 years?  Come on, tell the truth.  If it doesn't sell  in the store  after so long,  we take ownership of it  and it's sat  in the warehouse  for a little while.  It goes to the warehouse  for half place.  Oh, we got...  If it doesn't sell...  We got the blacklight.  We're going to make sure  this is a...  Well, you need  an extension cord, guys.  I don't think it's going to reach...  Sorry, not as good  as through the mirror, Opie?  Is that what you're  trying to say?  No, I didn't say that, really. 
[02:14:00]  You wouldn't say it.  Opie?  You can say it.  I don't know.  You just looked different  when you were sitting out there.  That's all.  What are you saying?  She's lovely.  I know she's lovely.  Stop trying to cause trouble.  Nora's causing trouble.  I'm not at all.  I'm trying to sit on the couch  and look at her hiney.  You have a nice hiney.  Oh.  She goes, oh.  Do you have an extension cord?  Are we going to check it  with the blacklight?  All right.  We're plugging in the blacklight.  We want to see if anybody's  been having any hanky-panky.  who owned it prior to...  I have no idea. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  Homicide committed  on this couch at 86.  Could only dream.  Turn off the lights.  Ooh.  This will definitely  make this more gooder.  It's light out.  We have to get some curtains,  by the way,  for them stupid...  We don't have the blacklight.  Matt, it's curtains for you.  I asked you guys  what you wanted.  I could have brought curtains.  No, that's...  The couch is fine.  Yeah, the couch is fine.  A post-1981 couch?  I have no idea  what year it's from.  It does look kind of 80.  All right, let's turn  on the blacklight.  Here we go.  Yeah, but you know what?  It's kind of...  You know, you're not going to... 
[02:15:00]  It's fine.  It'll serve the purpose.  Yeah, for a bunch of dykes.  Don't blacklight the girl.  Blacklight the couch.  Oh, boy.  Can you turn it on?  What are you doing?  Why doesn't anything  work on this show?  Ever.  All right, now we're trying  to figure out  how to turn on  the blacklight.  Come over here.  I'll fill out your card.  While this show  is just going downhill  in a hurry.  No!  We can't figure out  the blacklight.  It's fine.  Danny, what's wrong  with the blacklight?  I don't know.  It's not turning on.  Danny, Danny, calm down.  Danny, it'll be okay.  I tested it before  I brought it in 
[02:15:30]  to make sure that it worked  before I brought it here.  Perhaps the extension cord  is bad.  It's laying in the booth.  Plug it directly into the wall  and see if it works.  Perhaps the socket is bad.  There you go.  There's plenty of things  that...  All right, we got  the blacklight on.  It's the extension cord.  It's the extension cord.  Everyone calm down.  All right, pull the couch over  and give it a once-over.  How do you know  if there's a load on there?  What do you see?  You'll see white.  Oh, my God.  Is that X-Files music?  Very good.  All right, we're checking  the lesbian couch  for splooge marks.  So far, so good, right?  Anything?  We're getting a thumbs up.  Oh, they're pointing out 
[02:16:00]  something, Steve?  Eric?  Jim?  Yeah.  And on the armrest  would be where you would  bend a girl over and bang her.  All right, Steve,  absolutely.  What are you seeing?  Big white stain  right on me.  Get out of here.  Let me see.  I'm not lying.  Take a look.  Uh-oh.  What does it look like, Mulder?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  You would absolutely use  that part of the couch, too.  You would bend her over that.  That's a definite load  right there.  A dried-up load.  That light detects semen.  Oh, there's another one.  There's something going on  over there 
[02:16:30]  where your upper back  would rest on the back  of the couch there, Anthony.  All right.  What is that?  Is that urine?  Oh, that's just the design.  No, what is that?  Is that the pattern  of the couch?  It is now.  All right.  That's what...  I don't know, man.  Is that the pattern  of the couch  or is this just splattered  with sploge?  Oh, what about that stain?  That's the pattern.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  All right.  I see the pattern.  The pattern is called  jizz stain. 
[02:17:00]  It was very popular  in the early 80s.  Oh, is that a big stain  right there?  What do you think?  Wait a minute.  Maybe that's just  the pattern, too.  I think we have  a relatively clean  lesbian couch, Anthony.  I think so, too.  There's one or two spots  on it, but...  Well, I don't know.  Let's go back to the stain  on the right armrest.  There's leaves in it?  There's leaves  in the couch, Anthony, yes.  I aired it out yesterday.  What?  What?  I aired it out yesterday  and the leaves...  Outside and leaves fell?  Yeah.  All right.  She aired it out.  Thanks. 
[02:17:30]  Wow.  Look at that.  A condom.  No.  All right.  I think we're  pretty clean, though.  It's clean.  There's a thousand  young couches.  Let's go back  to this stain over here.  I think this might be  just part of the...  No, that's a stain.  Okay.  Yeah, that's a stain.  We definitely have  one stain in it.  All right.  Well, hopefully tomorrow  we'll get a bunch more  stains on that thing.  Okay.  Sorry, Jimmy.  You won't be here.  That was nice.  I like that.  The lights were out.  The X-Files music playing.  Yeah, I like the light back.  The weird black light on  like they're investigating  something.  Very nice. 
[02:18:00]  That was good.  Well, guys,  the show became  more gooder today.  I'm glad there's no  lesbians here to use it.  I know.  Tomorrow.  Yeah, tomorrow we're  going to do it.  Maybe they can't make it  tomorrow.  The Dykes will come out  tomorrow.  All right.  Well, I hope you  appreciate it and use it  often.  So when are you getting  married?  I was supposed to get  married this month.  But what happened?  Why?  Why?  Uh-oh.  Because of the store  closing and other stuff, 
[02:18:30]  so we decided to push it  off to the summer.  What was the other stuff?  Did he bring it up to you?  Oh, no.  It had nothing to do  with Ben.  No?  He didn't bring it up to  you and say,  perhaps, you know,  the store closing,  we should push this off?  Yeah, guys tend to  really want to postpone  those things.  Who's Ben?  Eh, so be it.  My fiance.  Oh, I'm thinking of  Ben Sparks here.  Don't say.  Our own producer.  So maybe he whipped out  that big, delicious treat.  It's not a big deal.  No?  No.  It's one of those  take it or leave it,  married or not married  things? 
[02:19:00]  Well, whatever.  It will happen.  Isn't it kind of an  important thing, though?  It is, and it will  be kind of excited  about that, no?  Oh, yeah, you are,  but you can't dwell on it  if it happens.  You know, you've got to  post it.  If it happens, it happens.  If it happens, you know,  we're going to have  a big deal of it.  Yeah.  What's the story?  Come on.  How long have you  dated Ben?  I have been dating Ben  for a little over  three years.  Okay.  Ooh.  His mom owns the store.  You know.  Uh-oh, the mom  doesn't like you.  Oh, no.  No?  She's in New York.  Oh. 
[02:19:30]  She's cool.  It's just that the  economy went down the  shitter and, you know,  people don't want to  buy stuff that's used.  Listen to Bush, it didn't.  It's got leaves on it,  yeah.  Yeah, they want to  buy new stuff and not  pay two years in no  interest, you know, so  they don't want to go  spend money.  Oh, it was used  furniture.  Because it's a consignment  shop.  Exactly.  It's all used stuff.  Oh, okay.  People kind of want  new furniture.  Yeah, they want their  furniture without splooge  stains on it.  Right.  They want clean furniture.  They want to shop at  Siemens, not have  furniture with semen on  it.  Exactly.  Right.  God forbid they want 
[02:20:00]  clean stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Do you have sales on  Tuesday?  Starting at noon.  We're selling the best  used furniture with the  biggest splooge  stains.  This Tuesday night,  come in for our  splooge stains  spectacular at  splooge stains.  No, of course it's  not named splooge  stains.  Your store wasn't  named splooge  stains, was it?  No.  And I'm not going to  say the name of the  store.  Okay.  So now things with 
[02:20:30]  Ben, you kind of, you  want to get married,  but.  Oh, yeah, we're  totally going to get  married.  We're now changing the  entire concept of the  wedding.  We were going to do  that typical, you know,  big reception and  everyone sits down for  a dinner and the  photographer and the  limo, you know, that  whole.  You're going to tame it  down?  The whole wedding.  Now it's going to be.  Just get a tent in the  backyard.  No, that's what we're  doing.  We're going.  Money was an issue.  I'm not going to lie.  Okay.  Money was a total issue.  So.  Well, it sounds like it.  Just a tent with a  bunch of load-stained  couches.  Instead of spending  30 grand, we're going  to cut it back probably 
[02:21:00]  to 10.  Fine.  So.  Wow.  We'll just have a big  fat party this summer.  All right.  Sort of sounds like you're  going through a tough  time.  No, I mean, not  necessarily.  No?  I'm getting through it.  I'm fine.  Well, it sounds like  the anxiety and the  furniture store closing  and the marriage having  to be postponed and  scaled back.  I'm a mess.  Fine.  Yeah.  It does sound like,  you know, it's a little  bit of stress in your  life.  And I'm glad you could  take time out from  your stressful life and  bring us a lesbian  couch.  So I had all the time 
[02:21:30]  in the world.  There are other ways  to earn money.  Jimmy will show you.  At the nasty hotel I  stayed at last night  next door.  Oh, did you stay in the  city?  I stayed next door.  How do you get the  couch here?  In your car?  In a minivan.  In a minivan.  Which hotel did you  stay at?  The one to the...  Is it the one Opie  used to stay at?  Similar.  Oh, yeah?  What's it called?  I don't know.  You tell us.  The one right here  to the right of the  building.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't even know  there was a hotel  there.  The Salisbury Hotel.  Isn't that a  homeless hotel? 
[02:22:00]  I walked in and  gone, oh.  I think that's a  flop house.  It's like a flop house  or something.  I thought it was classy.  No.  So not.  Lit Park of Meridian  is right across the  street.  And that's a wonderful  hotel.  I love it.  Why didn't you stay at  the old Park of Meridian?  I didn't even know it  was there.  Because business is bad.  That's right.  No, not necessarily.  I don't really care.  Couldn't afford it,  Jim, okay?  Thanks for rubbing it  in.  I wouldn't stay there.  For four hours?  I mean, I got to bed at  midnight.  She can't afford her  wedding and you spend  $30,000 a year on  hookers.  Why did you get up  in the morning?  Why did you? 
[02:22:30]  I didn't know what  time necessarily you  guys could take it in,  so I just decided to.  We were trying to  sleep after the anxiety  medication and thinking  about the business  going down and sleeping  in the hotel with the  red neon light blinking  through the window.  Actually, no, I fell  right to sleep and then  I got up and showered  and came over here.  Really?  See you guys.  Wasn't that big a deal?  No.  I'm sorry.  I got nothing.  I'm a mess.  Trying to sleep and  this is outside.  What?  What? 
[02:23:00]  I just want to drop  the couch off.  I know.  I'm glad I brought  it to you guys.  Are you kidding me?  No, we're happy.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, no, I'm glad.  That's better than  the last one we had.  It was a little road  trip for me to take,  you know?  Yeah, no, awesome.  We'll give you some  prizes.  Yeah.  I actually have prizes  for you guys.  What do you have?  What do you have?  I brought some other  stuff for you.  What?  What gifts?  Would you like me  to get it?  Sure would.  Yeah.  What kind of gifts?  I don't know.  It's just little.  All right, yeah,  go get the gifts.  Yeah.  I'd like a gift. 
[02:23:30]  Lock the door.  Lock the door.  Lock the door.  Opi, it's on outside.  Oh.  No, I want to.  Audio is on outside.  She's coming back in  with her gifts.  All right.  Bring her in.  Bring her in.  I didn't know  what you were doing.  Bring the lady in  with the gifts.  Jesus.  Bring in the present lady.  I'll hear the replay.  Talk anything about me.  I really don't care.  That's what sucks  about this show.  Don't.  Stupid replay.  Stupid replay.  Doesn't offend me.  No.  All right.  We like you, actually.  Yeah.  What kind of gifts? 
[02:24:00]  What do we got?  It's a magazine.  A sink magazine  that we're in?  A sign gift.  That we have?  Huh?  You want to sign it.  The sink.  You want us to sign stuff?  That's a gift.  And what's with the pink hat?  Pink hat?  Is that a gift?  Is that yours?  Steve, we got a gift.  No, like I said,  the store's closed  and, you know,  I listen all the time.  So, you know,  I heard a couple  different things.  Oh, boy.  I went to the store  and grabbed some stuff  just for...  All righty.  All right, let's see  what she's got for everybody.  Well, I have... 
[02:24:30]  Buckle in.  Well, considering Opie has  nothing to entertain with,  I grabbed something.  Uh-oh.  Oh, it's not bad.  What is it?  Is it one of those things  that's used for jacking off  like in 10 to midnight?  No, it's just a simple  little dish  that he can just  throw on the table  when he wants to do it.  Oh, and like chips  can go in there?  Oh, wow.  This is like a housewarming.  Hey, you haven't got  a housewarming gift  yet, have you?  So you gave Opie  something that is breakable.  It's gay.  I really, you know,  Jesus Christ.  Let's just grab some stuff.  Let's just grab some stuff.  Why would you give Opie 
[02:25:00]  something that  he could perhaps  accidentally drop?  You could have washed it  before you gave it to me.  Jesus, this leftover dip  in the dip part.  Check the price tag  on the back.  She spent $13.50 on me.  Thank you.  And then I got  two beer pitchers  for you guys in case...  Oh, we might need  the pitchers.  That's true.  Hey, I just grabbed  some stuff.  Don't wait.  I don't understand.  Don't be defensive.  You're bringing us gifts  and we appreciate them.  I'll just smash this. 
[02:25:30]  No.  He is the worst.  What?  I didn't say anything.  You are the worst.  Now, that's a nice picture.  It is a nice picture.  Is it glass?  No, it's that hard plastic, right?  It's plastic.  Those are good to drink  a lot of beer out of  if you're starring  in Young Frankenstein.  All right, what's that?  What do you got over there?  Looks like a Claymore mine.  What is that?  Oh, I think it's...  Poker chips?  Poker chips?  From a 1940s...  It's poker chips  that Al Capone used. 
[02:26:00]  You obviously stopped  at a garage sale  on the way down to the...  It looks like poker chips  in a hat box.  Oh, they're in a hat box.  Wow.  Wow.  I got some...  You got any cards  with those chips?  Yes.  Oh, let's have a little hand  just for fun.  Sometimes I could sit here now  and shuffle chips  with one hand.  Wow.  Like they do  on the World Series of Poker.  That's just wonderful.  This is good.  I'll bet there's a gift  for Jim Norton in there. 
[02:26:30]  This probably sat on top  of a 60s-style  folding poker table  for years.  I hate my gift.  What is that?  Dude, it's a joke  because they were  ranking on you  and you had nothing.  What is...  What's that?  My gift stinks.  Oh, wow.  Oh, they're playing cards  from the Moshe Suck  Moshe Suck Valley Railroad Company.  What the fuck is this?  Wow, I guess there must be 
[02:27:00]  some more gifts in there.  Now that's it.  No?  Wait, you got a beer pitcher  for Jim?  I just grabbed them  for all of you to use.  But what about Jim?  It's for everybody.  But that's not fair.  No, these are for everybody.  It's not necessarily...  But I don't drink alcohol.  Exactly.  Can someone open the window?  I'll take it back.  All right.  Name of the game  is Texas Hold'em, boys.  Ooh, you got chips  and everything.  Yeah.  That would be great  if they weren't...  That pack wasn't missing aces. 
[02:27:30]  Card with little cards.  Are there 52 in there?  I don't think  there's 52 cards there.  Oh, this is...  You should have never  brought these in  as a donkey sausage.  At least the other pack  of cards is still wrapped.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got one wrapped,  one unwrapped.  Would you gamble  at the bus station  on the way here?  Yes, I do.  And then this pack,  because there's  four decks of cards,  both of these  are still wrapped.  Atta boy.  I'd love to know  where these came from.  No idea.  Where'd you get them?  The store.  What store? 
[02:28:00]  Her store.  Someone probably bought  the men.  I can't imagine  why the store  is going under.  I just can't fathom.  With little tidbits  like this?  Little trinkets  and knickknacks?  Yeah, you might need  better stuff in your store.  Maybe that's what it is.  Wow.  You were selling this?  There's plenty of stuff  in there that was very nice.  I bet.  That's only the best  for your pals, huh?  You can throw it  out the window.  Opie, stop looking around.  I know him.  You break it. 
[02:28:30]  I'd be happy  if you broke it.  I'm just trying to figure out  where I could break it.  This place is so nice and new.  No, no.  This state-of-the-art studio  that we're in.  It's a bit.  Opie doesn't really break things.  That's a gang  from XM Satellite  built for us.  Opie doesn't really  break things.  It's a joke.  I never broke it  in my life.  It's a bit.  Oh, the cards  have little trains on them.  Yeah, little choo-chos.  Not the good kind of train.  Well, if you haven't  broken anything yet,  you might as well  because it could be  the first thing  you break in the studio.  You broke your mouth,  but that could be  the second thing.  That's a good gift.  You could have people over. 
[02:29:00]  You could put the dip  in the one thing  and the chips  in the surrounding dish.  Well, Martha Stewart,  this is a very good suggestion.  All right.  Well, this is lovely.  Thank you.  I'm done.  There's your couch.  All right.  Thank you for the couch  and the gifts  and everything.  You're welcome.  Why do you look  so dejected?  Yeah.  I'm very happy.  I play cards  and now I have chips  and two two-chain cards.  Two packs of cards  and a felt case. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, the case is felt  with some gold leaf trim  on the side.  That's right.  It's like an old velour shirt  I had when I was eight.  Can I see those pictures?  Yeah.  I promise you're not  going to break it.  Don't break anything.  No, I need the other one, too.  That's not bad.  Oh, I can't break this.  No, why would you?  It's glass.  It is glass, right?  They're both real glass?  Yeah, people will.  I was ready  to shower to that.  No, I wasn't.  I'm kidding.  No.  All right, Ben.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Enjoy. 
[02:30:00]  We got the lesbian couch,  which we will use tomorrow.  Opie got a nice gift  and Anthony got a nice gift  and I don't drink,  but I have beer pictures  that I can share.  You can put some soda pop in it.  You don't work  to the New York Times, do you?  You can put some soda pop in it.  Maybe I can have a Coke.  All right, thank you.  Oh, you're welcome, guys.  Okay.  Have a good one.  Thank you.  We have to take our picture,  don't we?  Well, it's going to happen.  Okay.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Wait, wait, wait.  Steve. 
[02:30:30]  No, Opie, don't, don't.  You're going to go  right through that window.  It's going to go  through the control room window.  No, Opie, oh my God, no.  Opie, don't.  Don't do it.  She's still there.  Oh my God.  See, you put dip in that  and then you put the chips  in the around there.  It's not even washed out.  It's nice.  And you can...  Look at the remnants  from the dip.  From the going away party.  Great party, isn't it? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  Why is this place so nice?  There's nothing to break it on.  Nah, you know,  don't drop it on the floor.  Opie, Opie, Opie.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  He just gave Jaime  a heart attack.  Oh my God.  Oh, Opie.  Oh my God.  You threw it.  Oh my God.  It's broken all over.  Hey, you got the little...  Now you're just separated.  You can put the dip  in that dish.  That's right.  I'm not even looking 
[02:31:30]  out the window.  I can't even look  at her face now.  Why?  Because she gave you something  and you fucking broke it.  I didn't...  I didn't think it would break  that easily.  It's ceramic.  Yeah, it's rare  when you throw ceramic  on a hard floor  that it breaks.  I could see  where you'd be confused.  Oh my God.  You are the worst human.  I can't even look outside.  No.  Why?  Oh God.  Not even smiling at all.  I can't believe you. 
[02:32:00]  I cannot believe you.  What's...  You can fix that.  A little glue.  Opie, look out the window.  I can't.  Look out the window.  She's going to cry.  I'm sorry.  Is she smiling?  You can put this  right back together.  This is not even  that much damage.  All right.  Well...  Oof.  All right.  Well...  Let's...  Let's get out  of this uncomfortable  situation, please.  And we're back  with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:32:30]  Norton was just lying  on the lesbian couch.  It stinks, huh?  It's fine.  It smells moldy.  I'm just tired.  I don't care.  All right.  Well, I like the lesbian couch.  Thumbs up for the lesbian couch.  It'll smell like...  It has only one splooge stain,  so that's good.  That'll change her.  Were you trying to give her  a thumbs up through the window?  Did you notice that?  How revolting was that?  Thumbs up.  And she did...  I'm with you.  She's just staring into space.  She's not even looking at you.  No.  I'm not trying to make up  for smashing her gift.  I just kind of tossed it  to the side,  and then it's shattered.  I don't know.  It's ceramic, 
[02:33:00]  and you broke it on purpose,  and you giggled.  You are an awful person.  All right, well...  Your aunt's doing nothing  but trashing those awful  1951 poker chips.  Yeah, see,  that's the difference, though, man.  What?  Why don't you say  what you were saying  during the commercial break  how much you hate  your poker chips  and wish you had balls like me?  That these days...  Those chips stink.  Nowadays,  you can get chips  that are the same chips  you play with in Vegas.  You know who uses chips like that?  Third graders.  Yeah, these chips are...  They need a little weight.  They don't have any weight for them.  They need some weight. 
[02:33:30]  These are the plastic chips  you used to play with  with your junior high buddies.  They're awful.  You'd steal them  from your parents  and play poker.  They are awful plastic chips.  Give her the chips back.  Yeah, you got it.  Why should I give them back?  Just tell her you don't want them.  You might have to, man.  Oh, Bray's a good point.  Tell her you don't want  her stupid chips.  Why do I have to be  part of your rudeness?  Because you're like  all brave  when we're in commercial break.  But I can understand,  you know,  that something might suck 
[02:34:00]  and I might hate it,  but I'm not gonna...  And, Norton, what about you?  These gifts stink.  They do stink.  I don't want to be known  as the bad guy today.  I don't want to be known  as the hat box full of chips.  The Lucille Ball hat box  she bought  when she was out with Viv.  She got that  from a garage sale.  A little stupid hat  in the box.  Now, take it back, Lucy.  Now, Anthony,  what's what it looks like?  Call her back in here.  But I understand  I can get a bad gift  and still be nice  and not hurt people's feelings.  Call her back in here  and give her her gift back.  Why do I have to hurt someone's feelings? 
[02:34:30]  I will not bow to peer pressure  and hurt someone's feelings.  Call her out on her gift.  I will tell her her gift sucks,  but I will keep it.  Oh, you will, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's see Anthony say that.  You're really not coming back in here.  Are you insane?  Hi, Erica.  I just wanted to say,  Opie had a little  mishandling of your gift.  He bobbled it a little  while he was trying  to put it over by his stuff  and it broke.  But I have the cards and chips  and thank you.  You guys,  I know, I know. 
[02:35:00]  You're going to tell her.  Throw them out.  You hate them.  I don't care.  What?  Tell her.  Don't bother me.  What?  Are those good chips?  I'm not saying that they're bad chips.  Are they good chips?  They're old.  They're probably from the 70s.  I just grabbed them.  70s Earth Mama chips.  70s Earth Mama Muff chips.  Throw them away.  It would have been cool  if it came from Frank Sinatra's house,  but obviously it didn't.  You know,  they could be worth money.  You don't know.  I don't know.  If they weren't money,  you'd be getting married.  You know. 
[02:35:30]  What's wrong with that?  Nice.  That's a genuine wood chip holder,  isn't it?  Hey, give me those chips.  I guess that would be  for my face, Steve.  No, look.  Give her.  Give Opie the chips.  Look, I'm just thinking  I like them.  I really do,  but I'm thinking  maybe somebody else  could use them more than I could.  I'd be more than happy  to take them  and throw them in the trash  for you, Anthony.  No, I'm not going to  throw them in the trash,  but perhaps somebody  could use them more.  Tell her.  I'll take them back, Anthony.  Just give them to me.  Tell her.  She's yelling.  Tell her.  I'm trying to be nice.  What do you mean?  Why am I being yelled at? 
[02:36:00]  You play Texas Hold'em.  Why can't you use those?  Well,  they're just not  quite the type of  equipment I like playing with.  What kind do you like playing with?  They're chips and cards.  Well,  different cards  and different chips.  People play with  different types of things.  Yes, sir.  I'll pass it back  to Steve Herderchips.  Just Opie,  give those to her.  It's heavy.  These are the cards  that are still...  There you go.  They're all wrapped up.  See,  they're still wrapped.  They're all wrapped up.  You ever play  52-card pick-up?  Oh,  Opie. 
[02:36:30]  There's no reason  I...  The cards had her.  Did the cards hit you?  Did they?  Opie,  she had cards  falling off her sleeve.  Come on.  No.  Oh,  God damn it.  Oh,  my God.  Opie.  Holy shit.  Opie. 
[02:37:00]  Don't videotape.  Oh,  boy.  Now,  clean it up!  Are you happy now,  Opie?  Are you happy?  I am mortified.  Oh,  Eric called.  She spilled my chips.  I'm not mortified.  I knew you'd do  stuff like this.  Thanks.  She spilled my chips.  Oh,  God.  You guinea brat, 
[02:37:30]  now clean it up!  That's right.  Be a poker player,  just like your father.  Oh,  my God.  I'm mortified.  I apologize  for the other half  of this program  because that is...  Don't apologize.  I don't really care.  That is uncalled for.  That was uncalled for.  I hope you got a good laugh.  I hope you got a good laugh. 
[02:38:00]  God,  he's still immersed in it.  He's fine.  He can laugh all day.  I can't even talk to you.  That is horrible,  man.  I knew from the start  it was a bad idea  to bring those in  in the first place.  I should have just  brought the couch  and be done with it.  That is horrible.  Look,  I didn't have a problem  with him or anything.  Oh,  for some reason, 
[02:38:30]  I don't understand  why he's got to be like that.  Oh,  my God.  I apologize  for the actions  of some of the people  on this program.  You know.  You'll enjoy  picking up your poker chips.  Thank you.  You guys can finish your show  and talk about me  and do whatever you want.  I don't care.  All right.  There she goes. 
[02:39:00]  Hi, guys.  Wait, wait.  She's walking away.  Wait,  can you take these?  Oh,  look,  she's getting her stuff.  She's not even  going to sit back down.  She's getting her stuff  and walk.  Oh,  my God.  There she goes.  Ben,  go smooth things over.  Ben,  smooth things over  a little bit.  That is the biggest laugh  I've had on the show.  We broke it.  You fix it.  Because  the way you  threw them  and rolled them  across the console,  it was a heavy thud  and they rolled  and all just fell off.  And the chips  are flying out 
[02:39:30]  and the chip carrier  fell on her foot.  It just,  it was the most  horrible thing  I've ever seen  one person do  to another.  That's the biggest  laugh I've had  on the show.  I couldn't breathe.  You are an awful person.  I literally could not  breathe.  I was laughing so hard.  I don't know  how you do that.  That just makes me  so happy.  Those are things  you think about  doing sometimes,  but no human  does them.  But Opie,  just stay.  Oh,  these chips.  I'll break your bowl.  I'll throw the chips  at you.  I'll fling the cards  at your face.  Oh,  these chips 
[02:40:00]  have coffee stains  on them.  These are awful.  Oh,  see,  now you're brave.  Oh,  I can't be brave  with you.  Holy S,  the back of my skull  hurts.  I laugh so hard.  Eric from Jersey,  the sound of plastic  chips raining to the  floor was the saddest  sound I've ever heard.  It will be like  the sound of the  thousands of tears  she's going to shed  in the car.  Yeah.  Gave her a nice  garbage bag full  of O'Neil stuff.  She is bawling,  crying.  Oh,  my God.  See,  I knew it.  Here's what she said.  She goes,  I don't mind 
[02:40:30]  if he broke it,  but he threw it  at me.  Oh,  no.  And she turned  her face  into the wall  near the elevator  and that's all  you're hearing.  Stop it.  You are horrible.  Cringe radio  is back,  boys and girls.  It's about  effing time.  She threw  the chips.  I didn't throw  him at her.  Hold on a minute.  I think he's  being smoothed  over though.  He actually  didn't throw  him at her.  I'm going to go  check now.  I was a very  good athlete  when I was  growing up 
[02:41:00]  and trust me,  I didn't throw  him at her.  Go fix that.  I made it  very close.  Go fix that.  Oh,  my God.  Oh,  that's awful.  I cannot,  I cannot  believe that.  I'm horrified.  All right.  Opie has no  soul.  Evil to the  core.  Yeah.  That's what  they're writing.  And I wonder  why I'm alone.  Opie is the  effing antichrist.  And I wonder  why I'm alone. 
[02:41:30]  I go home alone  every day and I  wonder why.  Why am I alone?  Jesus.  Can't figure that  one out.  You made her cry.  I didn't want her  to cry.  She was nice and  she tried to be  good natured about  it.  I know.  She tried to  take the ribbing.  It was the loud  chips falling before  the thing rolled off  the console.  That was a big  bet.  I'm all in.  I will splash 
[02:42:00]  the pot whenever  the fuck I  please.  Dude, you  gotta read  something to  the instant  feedback.  This guy,  Cody from  Buffalo.  Opie put some  good force into  throwing those  chips.  Sounds like  some South  American ring  stick.  No, that's  I was horrified  during that whole  thing.  An update?  Yeah.  Steve's out  there.  They're getting  her to breathe  and calm down  and they're  going to try  to see if she  wants to come  back in and  get her picture.  Yeah, because  she wanted  pictures and  stuff. 
[02:42:30]  Tell her if she  cleans up.  Say you're  brave without  her in the  studio.  That's the  difference.  I admit it.  That's the  difference between  you and I.  Say that to  her face.  I've done  enough.  Haven't you  done enough?  I think I've  done enough.  I can't.  Do we have  the videotape?  You didn't get  that on  videotape?  Yeah, I did.  You got that  on videotape?  It kind of  rolled on the  console.  I kind of just 
[02:43:00]  rolled it at her.  She had plenty  of time to get  out of the way.  Want to get her  photo.  Oh my God, she  comes here to give  something to the  show and get a  picture with Opie and  Anthony.  Maybe she should  have gave something  to us from this  decade.  Who are you to  say that our  gifts aren't good  enough?  You know what?  He raised  frankincense and  myrrh not a good  enough gift, Opie?  We're starting a  rule on the show.  You bring gifts,  don't get them from  a garage sale.  That's all we ask.  You know, baby  Jesus' best gift he  got was a song from 
[02:43:30]  a little drummer boy,  Opie.  It had nothing to do  with materialism,  had nothing to do  with the gold,  frankincense, and  myrrh might have  been good gifts,  but the little  drummer boy's song  was the best gift  of all.  And I'd have taken  that over those  lousy chips.  All right, let me  see the video,  Anthony.  All right, here's  the video.  We're looking back  at the tape.  She's all smiley.  Steve, I'll need a  screening when you're  done there.  Oh my God.  Well, you kind of  missed the toss,  but you got the  aftermath. 
[02:44:00]  I wasn't really  expecting you to do  that, to be honest.  Oh, gee.  What did you think  you were going to do?  Play a hand?  It's like catching a  UFO.  You're just not  expecting it.  Wow, that's  well, look at  Norton.  I'm all in.  Show Anthony.  All right, bring that  over here.  I got to see that.  I think the audio  will really help that  clip, because you  were too close on her  face.  But all you see is the  chips go flying by her.  All right, well.  All right, let me get a  look.  All right, there's Opie  with the devious smile  on his face.  She's talking, still 
[02:44:30]  yes, smiling.  Oh, my God.  No, that's...  Oh, you see it  clearly.  You see the chips  flying by on the  table.  I see her crying out  front.  Him filming it.  Not even trying to  comfort her.  Could you face this  way when you break  down emotionally?  Oh, I'm horrified.  I am horrified. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, I'm not going  to fix this one.  See, this is the type  of thing, the barrier  that people say, you  know, how far do you  take things on  satellite?  That's where, you  know, I think the line  should have been drawn  somewhere.  Yeah.  Girl's just trying to  bring some gifts to the  show.  I definitely...  Give me those, I'll  pass them.  She enjoys...  What?  Give me those, I'll  pass them to her.  You're horrible, man.  That clip is hilarious.  You can see her face  and then in the  background, you can see  the chips just flying 
[02:45:30]  by on the table.  All right, well,  should we take our  last break and then  regroup here, I guess?  I think, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that was great.  She's been a fan since  the AF days.  Whatever.  It's the first time in  ten years she's going  to meet us.  Go buy Demento World  and shut up.  No, she's, uh, she's a  nice lady.

[02:50:00]  couples together on Love  Connection, you know that  nothing kills romance faster  than bad breath.  Smart Mouth gets at the cause  of bad breath without the  burn, and you get clean  breath for about 12 hours.  Other mouthwashes only  prevent bad breath for about  an hour.  Gum and mints, well, they just  cover it up.  Use Smart Mouth in the  morning for great breath all  day.  Rinse in the evening for  clean, kissable breath all  night.  You can even wake up without  morning breath.  Smart Mouth, for 12 hours  of real clean breath, look  for the green box at your  favorite store.  You're listening to the  worst of the O.P. 
[02:50:30]  and Anthony Show.  Serious XM.  Listener requests worst of  for the O.P.  and Anthony Show.  My name is E-Rock, E-Rock  Radio on Twitter.  Not to be confused with the  Twitter account that we have,  so you can request material  that you want to hear.  O-A worst of on Twitter.  Now, people are asking, well,  what if I don't have Twitter?  I don't use Twitter.  How do I get my request in?  Well, this time around, you  don't.  That's the only way we're doing  it this time.  Until we can find a better way  to do it, right now, this is  what you got.  But send it in.  O-A worst of on Twitter.  Let's go to the next segment 
[02:51:00]  here.  This one is from Jake.  He's at Caustic J on Twitter,  and he's asking for Anarchy  Radio.  Anarchy Radio was during  Hurricane Sandy.  Well, Hurricane Sandy had just  happened, and parts of the city  were blacked out, a lot of  flooding, people weren't  coming to work, people weren't  coming back to their homes in  the city, the shore, wherever  they were, and it was kind of  lawless.  Cops were out doing other  things, and you could pretty  much walk anywhere you want,  do anything you wanted during 
[02:51:30]  this time.  So we figured we'd give you the  soundtrack to Anarchy by giving  you Anarchy Radio.  I'm going to say Anarchy one more  time.  Anarchy.  I hear this new song, Gangnam  Star.  That's not new anymore.  Is that a Rock the Vote type  of song?  No.  Gangnam Star.  No, that's a, this is kind of  over type of song.  What do you mean?  Open Gangnam Star.  This is Rock the Vote fucking  music.  Is it?  Yeah, this song is hitting just  in time for the election. 
[02:52:00]  The CMAs, they did this song.  Yeah, all right.  Once the country music awards are  covering it, it's done.  No, it's a hot song right now.  It's just hitting the charts.  It's not just hitting the charts  by any of the tracks.  It is.  It's catchy, but it's not.  I mean.  It had half a billion views on  YouTube before you became aware  of it.  It's not new.  No, it's kind of new. 
[02:52:30]  I just saw it on SNL this past  weekend.  It was a rerun.  No, it wasn't.  Yes, it definitely was.  No, it wasn't.  Absolutely was.  Dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan.  Oh, sexy lady.  Yeah, he did that show.  Why is it?  Yeah.  I guess if you sing lady,  you could say it properly.  Yeah.  Why is he saying, oh, sexy lady?  I guess it's like artists that are 
[02:53:00]  from England with a horrible,  I can't understand you English,  but they sing perfectly.  Yeah.  It sounds perfect.  Oh, sexy.  Right, right.  Yeah, because when you're mocking,  what you've, oh, wait, wait, wait.  It sounds like that.  Okay, that sounds like a Ricky Martin  song, that end of that, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is, um, yeah, what was his big hit?  That was his big hit.  You're right, because I thought  the same thing.  Yes.  Which one?  La Vida Loca.  So he's just reworking  Leave a Loca. 
[02:53:30]  She Bangs, right?  No?  She Bangs, maybe?  Which one is it?  It's that one part that really  is very Ricky Martin sounded.  Yeah, this isn't a rock  type of song.  Yeah.  She Bangs?  She Bangs.  She Bangs.  She moves.  Stephanie's very upset with us.  Stephanie, go ahead.  Stephanie.  You guys keep talking about  siphoning, and yesterday Ron and  Fez was talking about siphoning.  I just think that it's a bad idea  that you guys are putting this 
[02:54:00]  in our heads.  Well, you should then hide your  car, man.  You think no one thinks of it  unless we say it?  Hide your car.  My car is full because I waited  online for four hours, and yes,  we are very, I'm a very lucky  to see it.  Aw, you're what we call a victim.  That's right.  Do you understand this is the  beginning of the apocalypse?  You're going to have to learn  some lessons.  Hide your car because I'm coming  to siphon.  What's the matter with you?  I don't want to argue with you,  but I'm just going to let people  know.  What's the matter with you?  What's the matter with you?  The zombies are coming.  We got zombies.  You don't just fucking... 
[02:54:30]  I'm stealing this chick's gas.  That's right.  Now that I know she's got a full  tank, that gas is mine.  Yeah, where do you live, Stephanie?  Yeah, what are you talking  about?  Where do you live?  We need to know.  Where do you live?  What's your address?  I know you guys are trying to be  funny.  I'm tracking you right now.  We're trying.  I see your car moving on a  screen right now.  I'm going to wait for you to  park and then I'm going to take  note and I'm coming for your  gas.  How does it feel to have waited  online for gas that you know  someone's going to just steal  from you?  I hope you were doing something  else while you were waiting for  the gas because the waiting was  a waste of time.  But Stephanie, I'll promise you 
[02:55:00]  this.  I'll leave enough gas so I can  get back to the gas station.  Back online and get me more.  So you can get me more.  Don't get each other out.  Stephanie.  Do you have other supplies,  Stephanie?  Stephanie.  Do you honestly think if we tell  people not to siphon gas, they're  not going to siphon gas?  Right.  No one listens to us.  We should even mention that  option.  I'm telling people are waiting  online.  And don't rape Stephanie either.  Don't rape her.  Stop it. 
[02:55:30]  Stephanie, you've got to hide  your car.  Stephanie, don't drive too far  because I'm going to need that  gas.  Well, park your car in such a  way that it's impossible to get  to the gas tank.  Stephanie?  Up against the wall or something.  That's all I'm trying to get out  there is to help each other out  and not put ideas.  That's sweet.  Stephanie, you're a bummer.  Stephanie.  Stephanie, you're a bummer.  We were going to take a stop.  Stephanie, you have any other  supplies?  Are you all good?  Do you have power?  We're very fortunate. 
[02:56:00]  No, we don't have power.  Oh.  We need our gas to fill up  our generator, which is why  we have a generator, too.  I'm stealing that shit, too.  Yeah, where's that generator?  Where is that?  Where are you?  I'll just go around the  neighborhoods until I see that  one house with lights on it.  I'm trying to get that  generator.  I'm going.  Generators.  That's right.  You know what the only  supplies you need?  Bullets.  In this day and age, when  this shit goes down.  Come to West Babylon so you  can see what's going on.  And it's going on everywhere.  I'm in fucking Nassau  County.  What do you think?  I live a hundred to 
[02:56:30]  about a thousand miles away?  We did four hours of  sad radio.  Now we're just going to  have a little fun.  Just pick everyone's  spirits up.  Yeah.  What do you think?  Well, you should know  then, Anthony.  Go in online because  you're going to run out  of gas on the way  home.  No, he's not.  He's driving to your  house.  Yeah, I know where your  gas is.  That's right.  He's taking your gas.  I'm going to fucking  just take your gas.  Anthony has a whole pile  of straws in front of  him.  He's ready to go.  He's ready to go.  In this situation,  gun wins.  Yeah.  You know what?  It's all good. 
[02:57:00]  I just don't want to put  these ideas in people's  heads.  Yeah, don't put that in  people's heads.  All right, listen,  you're bumming us out.  You are a bummer.  Back to Gangnam Style.  You're a bummer.  Yeah.  Take us back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Woo.  Gangnam Style.  Fuck Stephanie and her  downer attitude.  I'm going to be playing  this song while  feeling Stephanie.  Right.  This is music to  Siphon Gas by.  Siphon Gas.  Hey, sexy lady.  Hey, stupid lady.  Oh, oh, oh. 
[02:57:30]  Where's your car park?  Ah.  Hey, sexy lady.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Gasoline sucker.  Yeah.  What?  What the fuck are you  saying?  He's talking about  stifling gas in Korea.  Yes.  Ah.  Leave your car outside  and I will take your gas  for my fucking ride.  Hey.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:58:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait.  Just stop this for a second.  Oh.  Scott, what's going on,  buddy?  Scott?  What's up, dude?  Hey.  What do you got?  Hey, tell us,  it's almost impossible  to siphon gas out of the newer cars.  You just gotta poke a hole in the gas tank and get it that way.  It's almost impossible to siphon gas as far as new cars go.  Yeah, they got those springs in there,  and it's hard to put a hose down in the gas tank these days.  That means we're going to start poking holes in gas tanks. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Who's got something shot?  She's an idiot!  What's the best way to puncture a gas tank so we can get their gas?  I don't know.  You gotta be careful.  You don't want anything to really get hot, warmed up.  I think just a punch.  A fucking punch and a hammer.  Bam!  And then you kind of put a little gas can under there, 
[02:59:00]  and you're styling.  Not only am I going to take Stephanie's gas,  I'm going to gurgle with some of it and just spit it out on the lawn.  Oh, man.  We're going to have so much extra gas.  A lot of extra gas.  That's right!  And then you know what?  Stephanie's not even going to know,  and she's going to go and she's going to fill the tank back up.  But guess what?  It's going to have a hole in it.  Hold on, sir.  Jeff, what's going on, buddy?  Hey, man.  How's it going, O?  Hey.  What's up, man?  You were right.  Anarchy is starting already.  I'm out here on Route 112. 
[02:59:30]  The gas station is waiting until 9 o'clock to open  until they get the stock market report.  Right.  And we just heard that he's shacking up the price to $7 a gallon.  Wow.  Price gauging going on.  Gouging.  Gaging, did I say?  Gas gauging.  Sorry, gas gauge.  Price gouge.  I really do know that one, too.  I'm an idiot.  What happened?  It's almost a fist fight.  There's two Suffolk County cops here now.  They said they sent someone down from the Attorney General's office 
[03:00:00]  because it's price gouging.  But it's fucking crazy.  Exactly like you predicted three days later.  Well, let me tell you something.  Then why would you deal with all that shit, fist fights and price gouging,  when you could just siphon gas?  You could just siphon it.  That's what I'm going to do.  I got an old neighbor's.  Yeah?  I'm going to take it from my old neighbor's car.  She's in Brooklyn.  Fuck yeah!  Whoopan Gangnam Style!  Yeah!  Woo!  Gangnam Gas for everyone!  Fuck these bummer people! 
[03:00:30]  Time to party!  Time to fucking party!  These bummers are gangnam style!  They can't get there!  They got no gas!  No fucking gas!  We stole it!  We suck another gas!  Whoopan Gangnam Style!  I got an idea.  What up?  Why deal with siphoning when you could just carjack the person right after they fill up the tank?  Oh!  Should we take their cars right out of the gas station?  I'm thinking that might be even better.  Could do that.  And more efficient.  Could absolutely be better.  And once that car's empty, you just go to another gas station. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah!  GTA!  GTA rules!  That sounds great!  Yes!  Whoopan Gangnam Style!  Yeah!  Gangnam Style!  Carjack, everyone!  We might as well be your anarchy radio station.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Your anarchy connection!  Anarchy in the morning!  We don't even need to figure out how to pierce again.  It's open and anarchy!  Whoopan Gangnam Style!  Hey! 
[03:01:30]  Sexy lady!  What about sexual assault?  Can we start some sexual assault?  What is this?  An Anthony Kumi, a dream?  Ah, that is true.  Yeah, we're not talking about your dreams.  Oh, man.  You're talking about real life right now.  Maybe I went too far.  Maybe I took things too far.  We're not quite there yet.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Oh, we got a guy that's going to show us how to puncture a gas tank.  All right.  Let's say hi to Kevin.  Kevin, what's up? 
[03:02:00]  Hey, buddy.  What up, man?  We're doing anarchy radio right now.  Anarchy radio.  Get the sweeper.  Pew, pew, pew!  Society's gone.  Yes.  Huh?  Take your 511 tactical tomahawk and knock those two fucking front tires out so it'll caress  the vehicle and lean it forward a little bit.  Yeah.  Then you can take your tomahawk and whack the back ass into the gas tank and then siphon  out your gas that way.  Wait, that's a great idea.  If you fucking take out the two tires on one side, the car will lean a little bit.  The car will lean.  You might have a hole there in the gas tank. 
[03:02:30]  We'll get every last drop.  Nice!  Whoop on Gangnam Style!  We can go on as many road trips as we want.  Plenty of gas for us.  Lots of gas.  We'll fuck everyone else.  That's what I say.  You've got to start thinking for us.  Yeah.  We had a cooperative society for a couple of days, right?  Right.  Then when things break apart, it's every man for himself.  Right.  I'm going to Target to siphon some gas out of the parking lot. 
[03:03:00]  Fuck yeah!  And then I'll do some looting.  Yeah!  A little looting.  Anarchy radio.  Yes!  Get some Fritos.  That's what it's all about now.  The society's broken down.  No more helping people.  It's all about getting what you need for yourself.  Your own survival.  Why don't we just steal the gas trucks?  The gas truck?  You mean the big tankers?  Yeah.  On the way to the gas station, we say it.  Yeah, then you can sell the gas yourself in your own neighborhood. 
[03:03:30]  We just fucking, what?  Pull an iron on them and fucking, hey.  That's right.  Hey, motherfucker.  You take that, drive it to your neighborhood, set up a sign, $10 a gallon.  He goes into the diner, says a couple of people stole his truck.  No lie.  No one's waiting.  You've got to pay a little extra.  And then we sell fucking gas also?  Yes.  And if the cops come, throw a match at the truck and blow the whole shit up.  Whoop on Gangnam Style.  And RT Radio. 
[03:04:00]  I like it.  Giant explosion, burning gas truck.  And then we run and just find another truck somewhere.  Yes.  Whoop, whoop.  Whoop, whoop, whoop.  It's all about you now, people.  Don't listen to people like Stephanie.  That we've got to work together and help each other.  Roland's dancing.  He's loving it.  Roland's dancing.  Fuck helping people.  Yeah.  We've reached that point.  It's all about yourself now.  It's all about yourself.  People looking in the windows like we're crazy people. 
[03:04:30]  We're dancing on the radio.  Yeah, what do they do to help people?  Nothing.  We're giving real solutions here.  Real solutions.  Not wacky solutions.  These are real.  All the people that think we're crazy.  Yeah.  We're going to rob them for their gas.  Yeah.  That's right.  Yeah.  And I'm thinking.  Hold on a second.  I'm thinking.  Why wait for your house to have power when you can just find someone else's house that  It has power.  Yeah!  Home invasion, motherfuckers!  You can tie up the whole family! 
[03:05:00]  And stay there as long as I want!  Yeah!  I like it!  Oh, God!  Roland just threw a bunch of napkins in here, and he's dancing!  Yeah!  Total anarchy!  Roland's dancing, it's crazy!  I'm so glad that he's dancing!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  It's crazy!  I'm so glad we got this brand new song!  It's bringing the whole bit together!  Wow!  I love it! 
[03:05:30]  It's not a new song!  I think this is going to be a hit!  I think it's going to be a hit!  I think it's on the other side of a hit!  Wow!  Everyone's dancing!  This is great!  You've got so many great plans!  That's why!  I've seen so many people dancing!  It's looking for a big game!  I know what the world is like!  He loves to play!  He loves to play!

This time?  It was  Recently  It's the same thing I'm promoting now  It's American Degenerate 
[03:15:30]  It's my next stand-up special  It comes out August 23rd on Epix  And EpixHD.com  Last time we spoke  I was in your hotel room in Hollywood  And you had that  You know, take it  Please be offended  That was last year, yeah  Yeah, like you just keep churning it out  How do you keep coming up with material?  I had a really good year with it  It's weird  Usually it's like a year  But I shot this one 10 months after  Please be offended  I just had a really good run of shit that happened  Like as far as  I'm on the cellar every night  So it's like  A whole bunch of stuff  Like there was the school shootings  There was  I don't mean that 
[03:16:00]  That kind of came out  Really good bunch of stuff happened to me  No, but I mean like  You know how when something happens  And you go up  And you just start talking about it  And all of a sudden  There's something  And you can  And then it was fucking  Casey Anthony  I realize that came out horribly  But after I shot this  I was stuck for a while  I was stuck for a while  After I shot American Degenerate  I'm like I had nothing new  So I was just doing dick jokes  And then fucking  It was Paula Deen  Or one other thing happened  And I  Oh, no  I went to Noam's son 
[03:16:30]  From the cellar  I had a bris  And I went on stage  And just started talking about it  Because it really violated me  Like it fucked me up  When I saw it  And then that  Kind of sparked new material  So it was like a great year  For that last year  With like all this shit  In the news  And you know  But that's normally  Ten months is a little sooner  Than it happened  The bris  The Jewish people  That circumcise their kids  Yeah, yeah  But they do it actually  In front of everybody  In the house  Yeah, it kind of  It really  That can't be that sterile  With the fucking cats  Jumping around  Yeah, yeah  You're gonna fucking  Push the lasagna over  You hear just a little  Scratching in the box 
[03:17:00]  Like he's alright  Yeah, it was very uncomfortable  To watch  And it was a guttural  And again, I know  That I'm circumcised  I know that people do it  I'm clipped as we say  And I was  You're ribbed for my pleasure  Yeah  One big rib  I didn't think of  Less of numb for it  I was just  You know  Because again  I might do the same thing  If I had a son  A bris?  Yeah, no  Circumcise him  I'm not Jewish  What is it about  Yet?  No  Yet  Yeah, if I meet the right girl  Three shows I walk  You need not a position to walk  Yet  Yet 
[03:17:30]  It is  So you would circumcise your son?  I don't know  I'm not sure  How  Is that even  Like a wishy-washy thing for you?  Because I like to say  The part of me that is against it  Would like to say  Yeah, I  I would definitely not  But  I've just never been in that position  So I don't know  So  It's easy to say  Because I don't have a kid  I don't know how I'd react  With a kid  To anything  Like a part of me is like  Well, I wouldn't  Because I think you're hurting him  And then  Then I'm  A doctor  They go  No, no, no  These are the stats  On fucking penile cancer 
[03:18:00]  I don't know  I just  I have no idea  I think you're  Fucking sniffing  McGee over here  Yeah, I just wanted to  Jesus Christ  It's a disaster  What are you allergic to words?  Jesus Christ  This guy  I have two different  Sons  Two different circumcisions  One  I dropped them off  And they just kind of like  I waited in the room  They wouldn't let me in  And they just handed them back  Like  How long did it take?  Minutes  Not even  Yeah, this took a long time 
[03:18:30]  Look at the  Baroque  The Jews drew something out  Oh, yeah  The guy from Amazon  Walks in with the  Nine  Knife tool  What?  You want to work that one out?  Put some cones down  The Amazon guy  The Amazon guy  There you go  The guy from New Hampshire  Comes in with that big saw  The CF4  That's what his kid was working on  He just had stutter  Starting the lawnmower  Hang  Hang  Hang  Hang  The guy  With the tool  Great  The  Yeah, so my  My 10 year old  I dropped them off  At the doctor's office 
[03:19:00]  And they just kind of  Handed them back  Like in three minutes  And then  My two year old  I was in there  It was UCLA  It was a guy that does brisses  And he goes  I would really like it  If you were in the room  And I'm like  Alright, sure  So I just sit up here  By the head  And you put a big curtain up  So I don't see any  He goes  No  And like  It is like  It's kind of like  The eye in  Clockwork Orange  Like just that type of  Metal shit  Holding everything open  And the kid freaks out  And then you gotta put  Like Neosporin on it  But look  I've written this before 
[03:19:30]  And I'll say it  If it's that traumatic  We wouldn't want people  To touch it all the time  Like I got a bunion surgery  On my foot  I don't let people  Look at my foot  Or fucking go near it  But yet  You know  We lead with our dicks  Whether they're circumcised or not  Obviously it's not that traumatic to us  I don't know  I'm excited  I don't  Like  I think it'd be easier  And again  Just a guess  To fucking  Would probably feel better  If your dick was protected  Just to have that  Greasy skin sliding over it  Like somebody fucking  Rubbing little 
[03:20:00]  Munster cheese  Over your fucking helmet  And a nice velvety fist  Let me  If you get me really excited  I will unsheathe it  Yeah  Unsheathe  Yeah it's a great word  Peel it back  Well you see guys  Like  70% hard  And it just doesn't  Quite  The turtle doesn't quite  Come all the way out of the shell  Yeah it looks like that cartoon  That fucking fat headed thing  Poking over the fence  Kilroy was there  Yeah Kilroy right  Exactly  Bazooka Joe in the pants  But you are circumcised  I thought a guy that was circumcised  Would just be like  Yeah of course I'll circumcise my kid  No I don't know  Just don't know 
[03:20:30]  How about your daughter  Circumcised?  Absolutely  Oh yeah  Yeah to keep her from being a whore  So the new special  I didn't even know this was happening  What is it called?  American Degenerate  Jeez Louise  Was it you that was telling me  I just want to write this down  So I don't have to ask you 50 times  Like I did last time we did the podcast  And it's  American Degenerate  Yeah August 23rd  That's my birthday  Oh okay  Oh okay  Happy birthday  Oh okay  And you like this company  That you're doing it with 
[03:21:00]  They're great  Epix is phenomenal  They're really weird  Like when you're being a creative person  Or whatever  They don't breathe down your neck  They're not obsessive  They just  They vet stuff to make sure  You're not going to get sued  Like you know  They're not idiots  But they're completely hands off  They love the fact that I'm promoting it  They promote me  Like they're great  The best people I've ever done business with  And you make money  I made money  Yeah this one I absolutely own  I outright own it  And they're cool  They're going on Netflix  And like they're not  They just  They want to build their brand up 
[03:21:30]  And they're owned by movie studios  Like Viacom  So they get like all the big movies  Before anybody else gets them  I was going to come to you  Off the record  And I was going to tell you  I might want to do a special  What could you talk  Off the record  Jake  Jake off the record  I would say  Do it with Epix  I can't do Jake  And I can't tie in  Bet everything you had with Epix  I would say I'm going to open their holes  Like this  Yeah  I'm going to make Viacom wish  They never had them  Okay  That would be a great fucking sketch 
[03:22:00]  Just trying to sandwich shit  Where it doesn't fit  Yeah just trying to put in  Fucking product names  With raging bullcos  Stay with Paramount  I'll put you and Viacom  In a fucking ring  Let you beat each other  Fuck each other  I don't want to get  Blood on my studio  I'll get blood all of my logo  Yeah you're used to that  Drink up Jake  It's back in participation  On the net of the gross  Come on Jake  No Vicky  So yeah  Alright cool  Good to know  Yeah I like it a lot  You were fired up about it 
[03:22:30]  When I was in your hotel room  Doing the  The first time you were on  The podcast  And you were like  These guys are great  Like they're changing the game  And then the fact that you  Jumped back  Right back in with them  Yeah I mean  They're the people I wanted  To work with  It's fucking  It's like  Louis did one with them  And Louis Black  Has done shit with them  And Kevin  Smith before I did it  So I was like  You know I kind of  Wanted to  When they  Wanted to do the first one  I was like  Yeah of course  Because they got a good  Fucking track record  How are you  How did you square it 
[03:23:00]  With yourself  Black Sabbath fan  Jimmy Norton  Lil Jimmy Norton  The fact that  Sabbath stuck it to  Bill Ward the way they did  I don't feel like they did  I mean  No I mean  And I love Bill  But it was one of those  Things where the contract  Shit broke down  And Ozzy said in an interview  And again Bill might say  Something differently  That they felt Bill  Just couldn't play  And I'm not saying  I don't know what  The whole thing  Because Bill's like  I was playing fine  But they said no  He was just having trouble  Keeping up with it  And as a fan 
[03:23:30]  I would love Bill  To be there  Because I love Bill  And I love the band together  We did pretty good  For a replacement  Fucking Brad Wilk  John Bonham's bones  He's amazing  That guy  The album's a  Fucking masterpiece  Dude  It's a fucking  Masterpiece  It's one of the  Greatest things  I've ever heard  And I'm not being  A biased Sabbath fan  Like if I hated it  I wouldn't say  I hated it  But I love it  I can't believe  How much I love this album  Really  Even though they're  Not touring with Brad 
[03:24:00]  They're touring with  Tommy Clefetos  Who's Ozzy's road drummer  And he's a fucking savage  They're great  Hopefully Bill  They want to do something else  I would love to see Bill  Participate in the next album  Just because I love it  Mrs. Florentine was here  And she never mentioned  Anything about the  Fucking  Not being able to play  That was what Ozzy said  Jimmy Florentine said  You know his whole life  They only gave him like 5%  Of the whole band  Oh really  They split it like 25  25  25  You get 5  And then he finally said  I'm not doing it  Unless you guys  We split this equal 
[03:24:30]  As he would say  Unless you split it equally  Four ways  You know  Well you know  That's what Jim Florentine  Let's say  And then they  Come on  Told him  They said  Yeah you know  We'll fucking do it  They split it fucking evenly  And then you know  When it came time  To do the contract  They're like  Here's your fucking 5%  He said  Fuck you  I'm not going  They're performing  A block from my house  It fucking pains me  Come on  I do not go  It's like  What's the problem  Fuck it  They get the guy  But you know  It sounds good  You know  Eddie Trunk  It was his birthday  The other day  His hands  Crying  I do Florentine's 
[03:25:00]  That's good  I do Florentine's  So no  I don't  I don't know  What the money split was  To be very honest  You're like  Friends with Ozzy  You're friendly with Ozzy  I know Sharon  You've heard of Ozzy  I'm going to dinner  With them on Thursday  It's my first time  Eating with them  Which I'm very happy about  Well they probably  Use silverware  You can predict  The angst out  You said they're like  I don't know  How these people behave  Well I'm just  I'm very happy  In this day and age  Yeah yeah  Fuck it  What's wrong with you  Henry  The Ozzy  What kind of people are these  They even their hands  They're going to serve bats 
[03:25:30]  The fuck  You've been away a long time  We don't need bats no more  Jimmy  Maybe you've been away too long  Right away  Getting fucking fresh  With the bats  I'm looking forward  To a great deal  So  But  Do you know  And enlighten me  Did they always  Stiff Bill Ward  Contractually  I have no idea  I've never heard that before  In all honesty  I've never heard that  How does Florentine get the scoop  Because I'm on the metal show  Maybe they did  Or maybe  I'm on the metal show  All the time  I know this  It's hard for me to feel 
[03:26:00]  Sound like Chip Chipperson  Whatever  It's hard for me to feel  Any way about it  Because they fired  I came right back out of it  They fired Ozzy  People forget  And I understand  That Bill being taken off  The website  Was Bill's request  Not  Not Sarah  They didn't kick him  Off the website  He wanted his image  Taken off the site  And they fired Ozzy  In 1979  So  They should have fired him  And Sexton on  They fired him  What's he  What do they  Just put water on him  And he's on fire  I don't want to just 
[03:26:30]  Kill the whole show  And fucking laugh  Do it Chip  Matty boy needs to see  Some Chip  Matty how come you  Not laying on the floor  Fucking double guns  Chip are you going out  With Pearl Jam  Again this year  Yeah they was asking me  To open for him  But I'm like  Fuck that  Why  The crowds are too small  Huh  Fuck that  The crowds are too small  Yeah  What do you mean  They're too small  It's like 50,000 people  And Eddie Vedder  Like loves you  Yeah I know  He fucking likes  He sings a song  What's that  Jeremy or something 
[03:27:00]  You want to talk to him  Who's that guy  Jeremy what's he do  How come your lady  Still working at the store  Like why don't you retire  I was fucking  Had him cracking up  Let's get Eddie  To ask Chip  A few questions  Because there's  This beef can't stand  Between Chip  And Eddie Vedder  Eddie  Yes  Yeah  Sorry  Chip  It's good to see you  For starters  Let's just get this off  On a good foot  You're not Eddie  Here's the key to Chip 
[03:27:30]  He'll always let you down  No  That's where you're wrong  I don't know  Eddie  Like Bobby Kelly  You're like  Hey Chip  Like when I  You do Chip  I don't beat Anthony  My day is made  The rest of the day  And the rest of the day  I think like Chip  And I see somebody  Cross the street  I go  Look at this cocksucker  Crossing the street  With his fucking shorts on  Double guns  It's the greatest  It's the greatest weapon 
[03:28:00]  It's the greatest weapon  Ever  You're not  You're not Eddie  Because people try to set Chip up for moments  And ten times out of ten he fails  Like there was one time I was on stage in Chicago  We were doing a live event  And I'm there  And we had a chip off  People could do Chip  And so one guy came up  We were arguing as Chip  And he was killing Chip  There's all your new stuff  Yeah  And I'm fucking  I'm up there  And I'm arguing with him as Chip  And he's killing Chip 
[03:28:30]  And then people are like  How you fucking schooled Chip  What the fuck  People were mad  I'm like  Hey dumb motherfuckers  Chip stinks  He's not  He's not an anti-hero  It's not Alex from Clockwork  He's a fucking  He's a douchebag  He's not Buffalo Bill  Yeah  Whatever  Bill from anywhere  Fuck you gotta get up pretty early  Dabney Coleman  I don't like him or nothing  He's got a nice mustache  Yeah  You ever see 9 to 5  He's working  Yeah  Well I don't even know  Fucking good movie  9 to 5 was 
[03:29:00]  Fuck yeah  Dolly Parton's got big tits  Like my mother  Your mother Dolores  Yeah voluptuous  Now is your mom still hanging out  With the guys that help her work  Make the floor  What is it with the floor  They fix the floor all the time  I would walk in  A lot of times Lamar would be laying there  With her fixing the floor  And he was just helping her  He had really big lips  My mother would say  Put those soup coolers  On my clit Lamar  What was going on with the floor  I guess it was like  Fucked up  He was always hammering stuff into it  And I'd be in the bushes  And say 
[03:29:30]  Chipper get out of there  You gotta  Get juniper berries all over you  Get out of the  Wait  He was always hammering the floor  With your mother laying on it  Yeah  And I would just be standing in the bushes  Making sure everything was okay  Oh okay  And was everything okay  I don't know  People come up to me at shows  And want to show me their chip  I was at Bananas and Hasbroke Heights  And this guy comes up and goes  Double guns  Fucking meet and greet  The guy's 
[03:30:00]  I'm like  Are you gonna buy a fucking t-shirt chipper  Or what  He goes  T-shirt  When he got a fucking U-shirt  Or something  That's fucking terrible  He should have said an L-shirt  Fucking place where it went nuts  Long letter  Cocksucker  Cocksucker  Yeah  Double fucking word jokes  I don't know why anybody  Doesn't like Chip  Chip is the greatest  And it makes me laugh on Twitter  When I see T-S-S-S  T-S-S-S  Because it's just so much  I used to just do it to humiliate girlfriends  That was like where Chip came from  Like I would be  It was humiliating to them 
[03:30:30]  Like I would be in a cab  With my girlfriend  Doing Chip jokes  And she would literally be  Digging her nails into me  Or we'd be in the  In the restaurant  And she'd order something  Like she'd be like  Alright I'm a filet mignon  And then Chip just blurts out  How much is that  And she'd be like  That's so fucking humiliating  Because people think  That I fuck you  Like people think  That like this  This awful guy  They don't know  You're trying to be funny  So that was where it came from  Is I saw that it had an effect  I saw that it really got  In people's heads too  And they couldn't get rid of it  But why does Bobby and Colin  Not like it  Colin loves it 
[03:31:00]  When I did Chip  I said the word Chip  To Colin on this podcast  And he clutched his heart  He literally went  Aww  And I thought  Like I lost him for a second  No he gets Chip  It's a visceral reaction  And Bobby loves Chip now  Like Bobby says he hates Chip  But he loves Chip  In Montreal he said he hated him  He loves Chip  A lot of guys hates him  George Wallace  Come on Montreal  A lot of guys hate Chip  But love him  And they hate Chip  Because he affects them  And it's an effect  It's like  I don't know how it affects them 
[03:31:30]  Other than gold  I love this fucking guy  I do too  Like people who really hate Chip  Just ignore him  And don't acknowledge him  That's how you  That's people who hate Chip  You made your acting debut  In 1975  Yeah  In something scrumptulescent  It was called  Chip  A chimp  But no rules  Chip  Walk us through a day  On the set of that movie  I'm gonna riffle 
[03:32:00]  I just got there  And I was like  Whatever  You gonna shoot me  Or something  And they're like  We don't got no gun  God  The chimp  Was played  By a monkey  Named George  You ever read Curious George?  All the time  Fuck yeah  That yellow-headed guy  Yeah  I heard he started AIDS  That's not true  No  I heard that  It's a fact  Oh  Science  And home run more 
[03:32:30]  I could do Chip  All day  Every  Well don't ever  Think you're wearing him out here  The only  A fans love him and hate him  Because they do enjoy  Doing him  It's fun to do  Like  Because as comedians  We're trained to find  The best joke  Always  As Chip  You find the fucking  Worst joke  And you rifle through  The same options  And you hit people  With the same speed  That a comic hits  With a good joke  That's the fun of it 
[03:33:00]  Wow  Yeah  It's like you're firing out  A joke with the same speed  But it's an absolute atrocity  It's like being  Birbiglia  Oh poor Mike  Why  You're friends with him right  No I actually  I don't think I've ever  Met the man  I have no opinion  Whatsoever  I just have to pick a name  And that had a lot of syllables  In it  Yeah  I figured the longer the name  The longer the joke goes  Anything with two B's  Fucking good  Fucking Birbiglia  Yeah  And Babalado  Fuck him  Well if you're picking a song  You go with Baba O'Reilly

[03:38:00]  To be on the air at nine  But you guys  On Opie and Anthony  You're on the air  At six  Right  Yeah I get up at  535 every day  You're that close to the studio  Yeah I live  25 blocks from the studio  And Kenny's voice wakes me up  I have my alarm set  But I'll hear like  Good morning  And I get out of bed  At 535  I leave the house  About 550  555  Walk in a couple minutes  After six  The music's playing  I ONA will read the paper before  I don't even read the paper before  I'll just go in  Sit down  Because like 
[03:38:30]  Those guys like to kind of talk  In the first break  About whatever they did  Last night or whatever  And you know  I'll jump in when I want to  But I never  Never prep for it  Less than an interview  Then I'll prep for it  But you literally like  Like one street  Shut down  Like if they just shut off  Like 10th Avenue  For eight blocks  You suddenly are showing up  To work 40 minutes late  Nah it's for me  Anthony it's a big deal  Because he comes from Long Island  For me  What a fucking guido  Oh he really is  That is the most Italian shit  I've ever heard in my life  Like I'm coming all the way  In from Long Island  Yeah exactly  Fuck it 
[03:39:00]  He was late  Because his drag car spilled  You fucking fool  There was a  Jakar Noir spill  On the Long Island Expressway  He uh  Did you get one of those abortions  He could get  He could get fucking  He could get fucked  But me was just going all the way  Go down 7th Avenue  Go down Broadway  It doesn't matter  You know  I'm always gonna make it close  I've never  I mean I walk in late  Once in a while  Very rarely  Very very rarely  I have a whole new  I mean I've always  Had an appreciation  For like  Morning radio  And you guys  Have always  Been my 
[03:39:30]  Close  Close friends  Especially in like  Media  It's you guys  Who are at the top  And everybody else  Is just  It's second place  You can't even see  With a binocular  Binoculars or something  Yeah binoculars  You should have  Fucking three of them  Fuck everyone  They don't know  What the fuck to call it  What's a great spray  For your breath  Binocular spray  Think about it  I put it on my fucking eyes  And say I'm blind  Fuck yeah  Everyone tries to help me  Yeah and then you grab  Their fucking tits right  Yeah  Sorry miss  Tits squeeze  Tits squeeze right  Double guns 
[03:40:00]  You fucking suckers  Double fucking nippled  Cocksucker  You fucking  Double fucking  Cocksucker  That's crass  I'm sorry  The band  What's that  There's a band  I never heard of them  Are they good  They're not polite  What the fuck  Jesus Christ  I love Chip  I can do it all  You said  You texted me  Like I go  You better bring Chip  You're like  We're doing Chip  The whole fucking time  Although Uncle Paul  Is the most fun for me 
[03:40:30]  Believe it or not  Even though Chip is  Because Uncle Paul  Is so revolting  That I actually  Will listen to Uncle Paul  Bits on the radio  On YouTube and laugh  Because I don't connect  It to myself at all  Like it really makes me laugh  It's such a barbaric  Awful dark place  Pedophile?  Yeah  But just the specificness  Of the comments  And you know  And it's funny  You know  I've never been molested  To my memory  I just think  You know  Like all these actors 
[03:41:00]  Kevin Bacon  Played a very believable  Pedophile in The Woodsman  And so many guys  You're not a bad looking man  I'm in The Woodsman now  But it's like  If actors can play them  Seriously  I don't feel any guilt  Over making fun of one  Or you know  Yeah  People should know  If they're going to get offended  At Uncle Paul  You're mocking  A pedophile  I am  But I'm also  You know  There's this thing with comedy  Well you never punch down  Sure you do sometimes  You do whatever you want  As a comic  Like I'm mocking  The whole thing of pedophilia  You know 
[03:41:30]  Because we convince ourselves  Like if you do a rape joke  Well as long as you're not  Making fun of the victim  Any type of rape joke  Is somehow  Making fun of the victim  Even if it's not  Even if the punchline  Is not directed  At the victim  If you're mocking a rape  In any way shape or form  Even if it's the  Bad participant  It's still somehow  Hitting the victim  Because you're mocking the rape  So you know  To be real about it  I don't look at it like that  Like  You know  I wouldn't go up  And just  You know  Ha ha  Kid got molested  Because there's really no  I don't 
[03:42:00]  I wouldn't think of anything  Funny to say there  But like you know  Hey how many Catholic school jokes  You know what I mean  Like you talk about  The church or whatever  People mock the church  Or like you know  Hey this cute little altar boy  And you know  ADS technically mocking the priest  But it's mocking the whole thing  But to me  The church stuff  Like Bill Maher  I tuned out  Because it's like  The lowest hanging fruit  Like altar boy  Fucking pat him on the head  Off you go  It's like  Like really  Like that's  I mean  To me it's like  Fucking airline food joke  It is 
[03:42:30]  But there's no  There's no joy  In a good tax exempt status joke  You know what I mean  There's no visceral reaction  In fucking  You know  Fucking art  In the Vatican humor  You know  But there's something about  That  That gets to people so much  Because it's  It's such  It's an Anthony Weiner scandal  It's a  We got you  Motherfucker  And it's  Undeniable  Like it's very rare  That you can get  Any organization  That has been  So one way  For so long 
[03:43:00]  On such a  Blatant  And flagrant  Offense  You know what I mean  Like very rarely  It's like you know  Getting Nixon at Watergate  Like with such a  You don't get guys  Doing that  That often  That's why I think  The church  And it's just  It's  Like the last Pope  I fucking  I had a hatred  A visceral hatred  For Benedict  Hated him  I don't think anybody  Really liked him  And like  See here's the thing  With me  I'm  I'm a converted Catholic  I converted to Catholicism  And I know everything  That goes on  And went on 
[03:43:30]  And the cover ups  And all that  But like  My church  Is the best  And there's a sign  Over the door  That says  All are welcome  Uncle Paul  There's a sign  Over the door  That says  All are welcome  Sure  You go on  And there  You do a little  Worshipping  You just go in  And go  Hey guess what I did  Sorry  Nobody says nothing  Yeah  You stop sniffing  Yeah  You cured your sniffles  Uncle Paul  You need a ride home  You need to rub your leg 
[03:44:00]  Okay  Yeah  Good boy  Rub your little leg  Get little Boy Scout shorts  What is he doing  He's fighting a heart on  And who's the guy  I've never seen  There's the third one  Opie  It's a one name guy  I've never  Shut up  Edgar  Shut up 
[03:44:30]  I've never seen Edgar  But apparently  There's really not much to Edgar  It's his touch that everybody hates  I was going to say  Apparently  He has very creepy hands  Apparently  Shut up  You're  You're not a good person  Shut up  It's a fingernail  Talk about fighting a heart on  It's a fingernail  Poke  And  And  And I got that  Again  I would do it to my ex  And she hated it so much  One time she bit my face  Because I was doing Edgar to her  She 
[03:45:00]  It was  It was a gut  Reaction  To Edgar  Like  And that to me  Means  And Anthony  I love annoying  While he's doing  That's mostly why I do him  It's because it's a real thing  Like Anthony's doing a live read  And he's just  Stop touching me Edgar  And it just makes me so happy  That we have this  Not Jim Edgar  Yeah but it's this  Juvenile idiot  Fucking relationship  And it's just fun  It's like throwing a  It's like gassing in your hand  And cupping it in your friends  You know it's like  It's that level of childishness  It's fun  Makes the radio show fun  Yeah  It's always fun  The show  And I don't know 
[03:45:30]  How you guys do it  And anybody that wants to listen  Opie and Anthony  I don't  XM moved it around  In Sirius  Yeah we don't know the channels  But you can find us  Sirius XM  Whichever service you have  You can get it  Let me just google search  Opie and Anthony  Sure  But like for me  I'm doing sports  So like every day  Like a cowboy wraps his car  Around a tree  And takes out one of his  Fucking teammates  I'm up and running  For the next two days  My job is based on people  Doing terrible things  In their lives  And I get to run with it  Like oh god  I hope somebody gets divorced 
[03:46:00]  Or busted for steroids  That would be great  Busted for divorce  Busted for drunk  Driving  Made me feel great  But like with you guys  And Opie and Anthony  It's  You're just  Talking  And it's become  The hang  Where  Other radio shows  Will have a guest  In studio  And I guess  The apples and oranges  Comparison would be  Howard  Will have like  A guest in studio  And it's like  20 minutes  Just light on that guest  Let's get to the bottom of it 
[03:46:30]  You got problems  You got blah blah blah  And then they're on to something else  And then it's news in this  But like there's some days  I've been on Opie and Anthony  It was me  You  Ron Bennington  Louis C.K  Ricky Gervais  I've been in there with  Me you  David Lee Roth  And Billy Connolly  And somebody  When I called once  And it was you  Jim Jeffries  Bill Burr  And the Iron Sheik  Like it is the weirdest  Combinations  Yeah and like  No one gets run  Like well we're all done  With you  Obviously people that are  On a schedule  You know like 
[03:47:00]  Hey he's the fifth runner up  From American Idol  Well okay you're all done here  Moving along  Yeah  Sell your records  But like with the comics  It's been the best home  And what I always thought  Radio should be  And there's really no one  That comes in  There's a definite energy to it  It is a hang  So when guys come in like  Waka waka  Like they're on the road  It does not work  It doesn't work at all  No and I'm  You know it is a really weird hang  It's like we all just walk in  And we talk to each other 
[03:47:30]  On the air  The same way we do off the air  I mean it's a little bit  More focused and higher energy  Because of course  It's a performance of some sort  But it really is the way  We speak to each other  And we fucking just kind of  Shit on each other  And it's like  I think doing sports radio  Is very hard though  Because you have to  A you have terrestrial parameters  Language and content wise  You know obviously  You know the things  That you can't do  With us we can just say  Whatever we want  Again there's very few  Things that we can say  Aside from legal issues  Of you know libel or slander  I forget which is the spoken one  Slander I think 
[03:48:00]  And you can't just go on  And say racially hateful things  Without any purpose  Because the company would probably go  Like what the fuck you're doing  But you know we are allowed  To express any and all opinions  And you know we're allowed  To use very very honest language  We're covering stories  About race or anything else  And it's a great great  Fucking free  I forget how lucky I am sometimes  Until I see people  That can't do that  And it's like holy shit  We really do  I can say almost anything 
[03:48:30]  I want as a performer  Whether it's on Twitter  Or on stage  Or on my  The radio show I'm on  And it's a very very free place  Which you know  Like I would love to be  More famous than I am  But the fact that I'm  I'm in a decent place  And have absolute freedom  Is worth it  Do you ever get up at 535  And go  Fuck  What the fuck am I doing  Yeah every day  Not why am I doing this  Every day I'm like  This sucks a cock  I hate it  But I love the gig so much  Like I'm an insomniac 
[03:49:00]  And I have apnea  So I don't sleep at all  I'm a terrible  I go on like usually  Two and a half  Three hours  You look good for an insomniac  Thank you  I never get  And you are in shape  I'm in better shape  I'm still working on it  Because I just got obsessed  With the gym  Wonder why  Fucking yoga pants  On the bike in front of me  Well I said  What the fudge  You know  If I'm going to be  Obsessed with something  Why not the gym  Or maybe a franca repeat  You know  Whatever names  You want to use  You ever go spinning chip  Fuck yeah  Yeah  Put a little girl  On my pecker spinner 
[03:49:30]  A little  But that doesn't even make sense  Not a child  I mean a little small lady  You put her on your pecker  And your spinner  Oh  A spinner  Yeah  All right  You fuck  Whatever  I don't do that  With little ones  You know  No  Yay  Wow  Uncle Paul  You do  Are you admitting  To an Uncle Paul  It was always fun  When I'd walk out  Of the rest area  My girlfriend  I'd walk in the rest area  And I'd just have to tell her  Like let's get in the car  We had a misunderstanding  You know 
[03:50:00]  I'd just go through a story  About how some  Some fodder punched me  You know  It was just fun  It's just fun  Kevin Ryder  From Kevin and Bean  Was here  And he gets  Oh I'm actually  Meeting guys  A guy who gets excited  About a tie-in  That he shouldn't  I'm actually seeing  Those guys  For the first time  Tuesday  Jimmy was waving  Both hands  Like he's putting  A whammy  On somebody  Not up in the air  Like if you were  Trying to jinx a batter 
[03:50:30]  With your fingers  Extended  Like whoa  And it's just such a  Who gives a shit tie-in  Like he knows  He'd be like  I'm doing those guys  Guys  Derail the story  You mean middle  Back on the road  Yeah  He said he gets up  Every day  Like you  I think it was  Five  I don't know  Four fifty nine  Five oh five  And he said  Every  He goes  I said  In twenty seven years  Of waking up at five  Do you  He goes  I fucking hate it  This morning  And I'm like  Twenty seven years  You can't get on a schedule  Never get used to it 
[03:51:00]  Why is that  Well especially  Doing stand up  Because I'm doing  I'm going out  Doing spots  And I can't sleep  Fucking stripes  Or something  I tried a few polka dots  It's kind of like  Spots though  I fucking love you Chip  Chip's a good man  You know  That makes it hard  But I have another  Sleep study coming up  My third  In fucking house  Sleep study  I mean like  Got to go to a place  But doesn't that  Make you sleep less  Because you're laying in bed  Obsessing over what 
[03:51:30]  Happened at the sleep study  Part of it  Yeah  But I mean  Even when I fall asleep  I'm always like  Remembering waking up  I wake up gasping  Because I have  I have what they call  Complex sleep apnea  It's a combination  Of central sleep apnea  And obstructive  Which means that  Like half the times  My fucking  My dumb tongue  Is falling over  My fucking dumb throat  And I'm going  And the other half  Of the time  When my tongue  Is not doing that  My brain just doesn't  Send a breathe signal  Like all of a sudden  I'll wake up  Sometimes  I'll do this  And then not 
[03:52:00]  Attempt to breathe  My fucking dummy  Yeah my dumb brain  Is probably fucking  Going over Eros ads  Wondering if certain  Girls are fully  Functional or not  And forgets to  Draw a breath  Fucking asshole I am  And I just can't breathe  It's never eight inches  It's always a disappointment  When you get in there  It's a fucking lie  It's that eight inches  Fully functional  This is half mast  I'm being generous  Let's just say  It was a rudderless ship  What's that? 
[03:52:30]  Huh?  Oh sorry  So  So yeah  I don't sleep at all  So you have such  Sleep problems  That you went into  A sleep study  I did one home one  And then two  What does that entail?  A sleep study  Is when you go to the place  It's awful  And the home one  I knew I had apnea  I knew it  So the guy gave me  A home sleep study  I'm an insomniac  I won't sleep  So you put this dumb thing 
[03:53:00]  Like a miner's helmet  On your head  It's fucking  Humiliating and awful  And it records data  You put like these little  Tubes under your nose  And it matches your  It kind of records  Your breathing pattern  Gives them a little bit  Of info  But that's at your house  You do this  Yeah but that  When you go in for a study  It is  It takes them 20 minutes  To hook you up with wires  You have probably 30 wires  On your legs  Your head  You have something  On your chest  And they put a mask  On you  How can you sleep like that?  Exactly  That's exactly what I said  I took  The first time I took 
[03:53:30]  I actually slept  I took like a melatonin  And the second time  I've never taken it before  Since I got a prescription  For one pill  For Ambien  Because I needed the results  I had to be asleep  For the mask  They do what they call  Titrate the mask  Which is to match  Your breathing  And they have to know  What opens you up  And what helps you  Hit REM sleep  So the first time  They did it  They did what they call  A split study  We have to just test you  With nothing  To see if you have apnea  I'm like  I have apnea  And they  Well we have to test you  So they wake me up  Halfway through  They're like  Yes you have apnea 
[03:54:00]  Now try a CPAP  So a CPAP  Is constant positive  Or continuous positive  Airway pressure  Which blows air in  And helps you breathe  When your tongue  Blocks your dumb throat  So at the end of the night  They're like  Well the test  Was a little inconclusive  I bet your tongue  Fucking failed the test  Yeah I said to my tongue  What you didn't study  Or something  You know  Like that  Fucking double guns  Fucking stupid  Yeah double tongues  Sounds like guns even Jay  So I fucking  Whatever  You know 
[03:54:30]  Tongue guns  Live and let live  Fuck yeah  Lick and let lick  That's what I say  Fuck yeah  Lick it  Yeah make your cuda so wet  It'll be like  The Edmund Fitzgerald  Or something  You know  Fucking beaver in a week  I don't like to say that word  My mother Herbie's saying that  She's like  Which one  Beaver  Oh  Chippinat's vulgar  Really  What's that  Oh that's me in the mask  Yeah  Oh my god  Anthony Hopkins  That's uh  But the 
[03:55:00]  Flarese  But when you're all  Fucking  Let me see  And you creeps  I thought you looked at it  I thought you said  I thought you said  I'm wearing a mask spider  But when you're all  You tweeted this  Oh yeah  Will you send this to me  So I can tweet  How weird the podcast got  Yeah  Like wow  So Bane has  Sleep apnea  Oh yeah  Yeah  I referenced that  Yeah of course  It's fucking awful  It's awful  And what did they  What was the conclusion  Did they make you go back to sleep  Well the second time  I went back  Because the first one  Was inconclusive  So they tested me 
[03:55:30]  On other machines  And the fucking  I need what they call  The CPAP didn't work  APAP didn't work  BiPAP  Which is two different  Pressures  Doesn't work  I told the fucking  Dumb  Cunt  Technician lady  I have complex apnea  I knew it was central  I knew what I had  Because I know  That I wake up  Not snoring  But just not breathing  I knew I had a combination  So she wouldn't test me  On what I call  An ASV machine  Which is a really  Really sensitive  Advanced machine  So when I  Because they all  Blow air into your  Fucking face  What all the nurses 
[03:56:00]  No yeah  They queef on you  If I can wake up  Wake up stupid  But the  When  All the machines  Blow air down your throat  To move you  To keep it open  So your tongue  Doesn't block it  But the  The central one  Is a very weird  Apnea  So you need a  Specific machine  For it  And I told her  And she's like  No you don't need  That machine  It breathes for you  But that's what I need  So now I'm going  Back to another place  And they're going  To test me on that  It's an abomination  So what is the  Like let's say 
[03:56:30]  They find something out  Are they going to  I mean they can't  Prescribe you  A narcotic  What they'll do  Is they'll give me  What they call  An ASV machine  They will give me  I'll get one  It's very expensive  Fucking steal it  Yeah and ask for  I say it out loud  Fucking guys crack up  And they'll give me  An ASV machine  And I will  The mask is the  Worst part  Why  Because they're  Fucking horrible  Because you're  Sleeping in a mask  You're sleeping in a mask  But there are these  Ones that were  Custom masks  That you could have 
[03:57:00]  Made  Which I think  The company closed  I was going to  Get a custom one  Made  I've had surgery  I've had fucking  What  Two office procedures  On my nose  I just went for  Another one  It's fucking  You should get a mask  And have it like  Painted like a beak  Just when you wake up  Forget it's on  When you look in the mirror  Just go  Hey  Yeah or I'll just  Make people laugh  I'll just wear it all day  And I'll just  People go  What do you do  I'm like  I'll just say that  Have you seen my eggs  You fucking cooter  Yeah I'll be like  Hey someone took my wings  Call a cop  Slip them 
[03:57:30]  You fuck  Yeah  Double tongues  Yeah double wings  Whatever  Doesn't matter  So I didn't know  You slept so little  Can you nap at all  No I'm a terrible nap  I do it better than I did  A while ago  Because my nose  Is better than it was  I have my  Again I had  Reconstructive surgery  In the sinuses  When was the surgery  2008 I went  And it helped  It was  And then I got  What they call  The things you have  In your nose  Which regulate  You know when you get  Stuffy  You feel like you're swollen  Those are  They're like balls  The things called 
[03:58:00]  Turbinates  In your fucking sinuses  They swell  And they get smaller  And that fucking  Regulates the air  Going into your  Sinuses  Into your lungs  So my  The guy I go to  Shrinks them with heat  He like  He puts a needle  In your nose  And numbs them  And then he fucking  Zaps them with heat  And it shrinks them a little  He doesn't like to cut them  Like and carve them  Because once you  If you slice too much  Of them off  You can never put it back  And then you get that  Like then you have  Too much air coming in  And it's bad  So he tries to do it  Piecemeal  So you don't fucking nose up  It's like a dog  Sticking his head  Out the window of the car 
[03:58:30]  His stupid gums  Flapping in the breeze  Because of all the air  You're taking it  But you're super happy  Like the dog  Sticking his head out  No you can't  He said it's like  Breathing through your mouth  And your nose  You're like  Like that's what it would  Feel like in your nose  He goes it's horrible  Have you done acupuncture?  No acupuncture  It's fucking child's play  I want to have a fucking  Witch doctor stand over me  Have you tried a witch doctor?  No I would do anything right now  But acupuncture wouldn't help  It's not going to fix my  I don't know  Because it can't  I know what's wrong with me  It can't  I think I have a problem  In my lungs 
[03:59:00]  Or it might just be in my head  A whole bunch of good stuff  Was happening for me  You know  It was all these school shootings  KCA  It was the fucking  That's going to be  The entire podcast  You're just saying  That sentence on a loop  I feel like I can't  Draw a deep breath of air  And I first noticed  Right now?  No now I'm okay  But I feel like  When I think about it  I can't take a full breath  And I noticed it on stage  Years ago  So it might be panic  Or stress or whatever  But it really is awful  Like I was suicidal  For a long time  About the breathing 
[03:59:30]  Because I'm like  I can't sleep  And I was going to therapy  Like once a week  And I would  I was fucking  I can't tell you  How bad I was  It was like  I have to get a fucking pistol  And just blow my brains out  Because you can't live like this  Anyone who doesn't sleep  It's like a fucking  It's a nightmare  My wife has a real bad insomnia  She'll go three days  Yeah  Yeah  Like maybe an hour  And I'll go  Did you sleep?  And she'll go  Some  And that means I slept an hour  From the time you went to bed  At 8.30  And she'll go </pre>
