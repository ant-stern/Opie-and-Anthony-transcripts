<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio show opened with a discussion about Oprah Winfrey's move to XM, speculating on her work schedule and the implications for both XM and its competitor, Sirius.  A caller, Ian from Nova Scotia, praised a pornographic film recommended by Jimmy Norton, sparking a conversation about the evolution of pornography and the role of Ron Jeremy.  Another caller, Jeremy, echoed the sentiment that Oprah's signing was a blow to Sirius, further highlighting the advertising potential of Oprah's massive audience.  The conversation then shifted to James Frey's controversial memoir, "A Million Little Pieces," and Oprah's confrontation with him, touching on the blurred lines between fiction and non-fiction in bookstores.

The show received calls from O.J., congratulating XM's Black employees (referencing Oprah and Earl), and updates on Earl, the show's executive producer, who had a meltdown after a prank orchestrated by the staffâ€”finding his belongings outside the studio. The hosts defended their actions, while a staff member, Steve, expressed disapproval.  Further calls covered "Howie Math" (attributing subscriber growth to the show), legal updates on "Club Soda Kenny," and listener reactions to the Earl incident, including accusations of Opie being on a "power trip," which he vehemently denied.

A substantial portion of the broadcast was dedicated to a debate between Opie and Jimmy Norton about their best guest ever, comparing Ozzy Osbourne to Samuel L. Jackson and other celebrities, peppered with humorous disagreements and banter about their experiences with various guests and the music industry.  The discussion touched upon their preferences in music, spanning different decades, with a caller arguing for the 80s' inventiveness and Opie favoring the 90s.  This led to a broader discussion on generational biases in musical tastes.  Anthony reluctantly revealed a secret fondness for James Blunt's music, despite his public denouncement of the artist, using homophobic slurs in the process, becoming a recurring comedic point.  The hosts also discussed their best interviews (Gene Simmons, Ozzy Osbourne, etc.), playing audio clips from Mario Cantone's Grammy wrap-up on *The View* and commenting on various Grammy performances (Madonna, Kanye West, Jamie Foxx), while constantly referencing Earl's disruption leading to the loss of most of their Grammy audio recordings.  Opie plugged his family's restaurant, FH Riley's, and the hosts discussed a potential snowstorm.  Bill Burr made a brief appearance, and listeners called with music recommendations and commentary on the show.

A significant portion focused on the documentary "Grizzly Man," analyzing Timothy Treadwell's life and death among Alaskan bears. The hosts played numerous audio clips from the film, highlighting Treadwell's behavior, anxieties, and ultimately, his death.  They lamented the missing audio of the attack and found humor in the film's tone and Treadwell's relationship with the bears. A listener called with unrelated observations, and the hosts discussed images of the attack's aftermath.  They received a Valentine's Day gift from "The Mad Mexican," which they defaced on air. The segment included an interview with Treadwell's helicopter pilot and a medical examiner who described the remains.  "Bill the schizo comic" called in and performed a short, albeit fragmented, stand-up routine.

The show concluded with a segment featuring "Schizo Bill," a stand-up comedian from Cleveland, who discussed his schizophrenia, his lottery win, and his mental hospital experiences.  He repeatedly promoted his MySpace page, while struggling with the technical aspects of the show, his medication, and apparent hallucinations, frequently diverging into tangential stories.  He shared jokes, mentioned a large neck scar, and claimed to see imaginary people in the studio.  The hosts reacted with a mix of amusement and frustration, ultimately ending the segment without a complete stand-up performance.  Throughout the show, there was significant use of profanity and offensive language.

[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  It's Friday! It's Friday!  Unbelievable. 
[00:05:00]  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  Hi.  The home of Oprah Winfrey.  Oh.  That's right.  The signing of Oprah Winfrey to XM Satellite Radio is the big story today.  She's the new kid. I think she'll do okay.  As far as the stock market goes and the media goes.  I think she'll do alright.  And the business pages and your local paper. 
[00:05:30]  It's a huge deal for XM. Very excited.  Completely different audience than what we're going after.  Yeah.  But when you're trying to build a media company, I guess it's a smart thing to do.  She's got a little power behind her.  She certainly does.  Got a few viewers.  Just a few.  Big story.  And I think she makes the announcement on her TV show today. 
[00:06:00]  They taped it yesterday, but it's going to air today.  I saw some clips about that today.  I couldn't tell you how far in advance any of those shows are taped.  I know some people do them the day before.  Other people, it's like months and months later, those shows air.  Man, it's weird.  I think she's like on a day delay.  Really?  I'm guessing, yeah.  Keeping it topical.  I'm guessing.  And then she takes Fridays off.  Yeah.  Really?  That's what I'm thinking.  I don't know.  That seems to be the thing to do when you reach like, you know. 
[00:06:30]  Uber status?  Yeah.  Or lazy status?  A lot of money, yeah.  Lazy status?  And you go, you know something?  The three-day weekend don't look too bad.  Wait till Howie's listeners find out that he's only working four days.  The company is basically telling Howie, don't mention it yet.  Don't mention it yet.  We're in a little shaky area.  We're going to be raising the rates.  We're going to be raising the rates.  So don't mention that they're going to pay more and get less of you. 
[00:07:00]  That's right.  So if you can bear with us, Howie, down the road, we'll finally let you tell your listeners  that you're only going to work four days a week and the equivalent of nine months a  year, something like that.  Yeah.  Oh, they're going to love you.  They're going to absolutely love you.  He was supposed to make that announcement already, but the company is so fucked up right  now, they basically sat him down and said, look, look, help us out here.  Help us out.  Don't say anything yet.  Let's go to Ian in Nova Scotia. 
[00:07:30]  Ian.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  I just wanted to call in quick there and thank Jimmy for his recommendation.  We spot on the money.  On what?  What was it?  Taboo 2.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  You recommended a feature?  Definitely.  I downloaded it last night off because, man, that's a fucking good movie.  It makes me want to have a daughter.  Yeah, it's a really good.  It's a gem.  Now, what year did that come out, Jimmy?  82.  82.  That's old school porn.  Yeah, Cardi Stevens directed it. 
[00:08:00]  It was really great.  That's old school porn when you watch and it was based on reality in some weird way.  They had plot lines.  Like the new porns, I can't get into because it's so stupid.  I like a little story with my porn, believe it or not.  Absolutely.  Something you could possibly get into.  Something you can relate to because the taboo part of the sex, like, all right, they're  having sex.  Who cares?  It's a dick and a vagina.  But if there's a storyline that makes something inappropriate, it's like, oh, that's kind of  hot.  Like, you know, she shouldn't be banging him.  Yeah.  That's why I kind of like it.  The new porns with the bright lights and it's a phony set. 
[00:08:30]  It's like, no, man.  The old days, it was all shady and, you know?  Yeah, of course.  And a plot line.  Was Ron Jeremy in every movie back then?  What?  Was Ron Jeremy in every movie back then?  Yeah, Ron's in the orgy scene there.  But he was really skinny back in those days.  Yeah, he was in everything, man.  How many movies do you think Ron Jeremy has done?  I'd love to know, dude.  Because you're right.  He was in every movie back in the day.  Every single porn had Ron Jeremy in it.  And he doesn't speak in this one.  I mean, this is before he was really famous.  He was just a hired dick, you know? 
[00:09:00]  And he was just in this.  A hired cock.  Yeah, he was just banging the orgy scene.  Well, Ian from Nova Scotia, I'm glad you enjoyed Jimmy's movie choice.  Yes.  Right on, guys.  Dave Kennedy.  You're welcome, son.  And good luck.  Bye.  All right.  Jeremy in Jersey.  Let's say hi to him.  Jeremy, what's up?  B-b-b-boy.  What's up, Jeremy?  Hi, Midgemi.  Hi.  Listen, as a...  Anthony.  Yeah.  As a heterosexual degenerate listener of this program, 
[00:09:30]  I am excited about the Oprah signing.  Wow.  Because there's another nail in Sirius' coffin.  Yes.  I think so, too.  I think so, too.  And they were trying to spin it over there yesterday.  It's like sometimes...  I was telling Anthony before the show.  Sometimes, if there's news that comes out...  All right, well...  It won't happen there.  Well, fuck it, then.  No!  He might have...  No!  No, they were trying to spin it over at the Little Doggy Company.  There are times when your competitor does something  that you either just got to make believe it never happened 
[00:10:00]  or be honest and say,  you know what?  Whoa, they got us there.  That's a really good move.  It's a really good move for XM Satellite Radio.  And to spin it any other way is just ridiculous  and you're not sounding honest.  You know?  Yeah.  Oprah's got a massive following.  Basically, it's going to be an extension of her TV show.  All those stupid housewives driving around like Anthony said  in the office in their minivans,  they're going to be checking out the Oprah channel  because it's an extension of the TV show.  It's all the people on her show that the viewers love. 
[00:10:30]  Now they get a little extra time.  And then you get Oprah doing something with Gail, her best friend.  You know?  It's just a huge win for the company.  And then Oprah gets promoted on this monster TV show that she has.  Yep.  I've heard rumors that she gets something like 28 million viewers at times  on that TV show.  That's a lot.  That's starting to get into the area of the audience we have.  Starting.  Give her time.  Almost, Jim. 
[00:11:00]  Almost.  So, you know, you get the free advertising  because she's going to be mentioning XM from time to time  on that huge TV show.  And all those dumb housewives that follow what Oprah has to say  are going to be running out getting their XMs immediately.  She talks about a stupid cologne on that TV show.  Next thing you know, it's the hottest thing in America.  Yeah.  You know, and you know the book club, obviously, what she does with that.  Yeah.  But don't cross her, man, because then she'll fry you live on TV  like she did to James Fry.  He definitely deserved it, though. 
[00:11:30]  Holy...  Did you see that hour?  No.  It was one of the best hours of TV in recent memory.  I heard it was really uncomfortable.  She just sat him down and ripped him.  Ripped him apart.  Why he would accept that, I don't know.  Because now he's finished.  He is finished.  Well, he probably thought that if I accept it,  at least I'll be able to defend myself on certain points.  I didn't see it, but, I mean, there's no way.  When you get caught lying like that, you just gotta...  Of course, we're talking about a million little pieces.  And, you know, James Fry went on Larry King,  and Larry King was like,  ha-ha, with the softball questions. 
[00:12:00]  Ha-ha-ha.  So is there any...  Yeah, go ahead, Ann.  Sorry.  Well, I didn't really have much.  Just to...  Is the cover really cardboard?  Yeah, exactly.  What, um...  James Fry went on Larry King,  and Larry gave him the softball questions  like Larry knows how to do,  and James Fry skated,  and Larry didn't even push the issue.  No.  You know, how much in the book is false,  and I think he said eight pages  or something crazy like that.  Is there anything about there... 
[00:12:30]  in there about garlic?  Yeah.  Or grape juice, Welch's grape juice?  So he's like, ah, maybe eight pages.  I exaggerated a little bit,  and Larry's like, all right,  you're free to go.  And on top of it,  Oprah calls Larry King  and defends James Fry.  Yeah.  And James Fry's there with his mom,  and James Fry's mom is like,  oh, oh, hi, Oprah.  All happy for her son.  And then it comes out that,  oops, uh-oh,  he wasn't telling the truth, 
[00:13:00]  nowhere's near the truth,  so Oprah's like,  holy shit,  you made me look bad on Larry King.  You're coming on my show.  Yeah.  And he sat there,  and Oprah just ripped into him.  Berated.  And it got to a point  where he just bowed his head down,  he looked like he was gonna cry,  and then experts that were on the panel,  on the same show,  talked about him as he's sitting there.  Ooh, that's not good.  And he was completely out of the discussion.  Been in that situation.  It's not pretty.  When they're sitting around talking about you,  hey, I'm here.  Yeah, I'm here, hello. 
[00:13:30]  I'm in the room, people.  But it was, um, you know,  publishing experts,  and media people,  and columnists,  and there's James Fry,  like, just looking down at the couch,  going, oh my God, can I go?  Please let me go.  You just gotta make it through the moment,  because, uh,  he obviously made a bunch of cash on that thing.  Yeah.  You know?  Well, now there's lawsuits coming out, though.  I don't know.  What could they sue him for?  I don't know.  For, for, I don't know.  Fake book?  For a fake book.  Just say oops.  But it wasn't in the fake book section,  is the problem. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, oops.  They didn't put a non in front of the fiction.  It was in the non-fake book section,  which is-  Non-fake book?  Which is fiction, I think.  What is that?  Fiction or non-fiction?  But wouldn't a fake story be non-fiction?  Fake story is fiction.  No, I, I know how it works, but-  But it should be not fact.  Yeah, because it's confusing me.  Not fact.  I'm always, I go to the bookstore,  and I, uh, I, I want to look for some,  you know, good real stories,  and I always, I'm always in the wrong section. 
[00:14:30]  I mean, I don't, I can't figure it out  every fucking time I go in there.  I'm the worst.  Well, doesn't, fiction doesn't mean fact, does it?  Does anyone know what fiction means?  I don't know.  No.  Fiction, it means fake.  Yeah, malarkey.  Yeah.  So non-fiction.  Balderdash.  Oh, come on now.  But then-  I used to go to the bookstores  and go into the, um, photography section  and just pull out the big photography books  and look for naked women in it.  Because in every photography,  not every photography book,  you'd have to pick and choose,  but some of them,  they'd have whole sections on nudes,  nude photography, you know? 
[00:15:00]  And it was a great place  to get a little bit of smut  if you just were by a bookstore.  How old were you when you did this?  Ah, in my teens.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I was thinking recently.  Yeah, last week.  Barnes & Noble.  You live in Brooklyn.  Jacking off.  I actually hate when people say  Barnes & Nobles.  There's no S at the end of Noble.  Shitheads.  People do that a lot.  They add that S on.  Barnes & Noble.  Are they going to Barnes & Nobles?  No, I don't.  Jimmy Norton's.  Yeah.  All right, let's go to O.J.  Let's go to Jimmy Norton's.  O.J.  Hey, what's up? 
[00:15:30]  How are you guys doing this morning?  How's it going to you?  Now that you've called, thanks, O.J.  Hey, I just want to congratulate  the two XM black women.  First of all,  Black Earl and Oprah.  Well, we have Tyra Banks.  Yeah.  We have some fine black people  working for XM Satellite Radio.  Absolutely.  But I tell you what,  Black Earl's the biggest black girl  that I know of.  I mean, that was great audio yesterday.  Oh, black girl.  I get it.  That's pretty good.  Well, we do have an update on Earl.  He's in a bit of trouble  with the company.  And I got to start the show 
[00:16:00]  by saying to the company  down there in Washington, D.C.,  they listen every day.  You know, it's definitely my fault  that Earl just lost his fucking mind.  Yeah.  We pushed Earl's buttons  until he lost his mind.  We've been doing that for years.  We needle him until he reacts.  And I got into a big discussion  with Ben and Steve in the office  because they couldn't believe  that Earl would take the box  that we wrote his name on 
[00:16:30]  with his stuff in the box.  And we left it so Earl could see it  as soon as he came to work yesterday  because it kind of fucked up yesterday.  Yeah.  And so Earl saw the box  with his name on it  with all his stuff actually in it,  lost his mind,  threw the box across the area out there.  It's a little joke.  And Steve is convinced  that Earl shouldn't have done that.  Yeah.  And I'm like,  we all know Earl.  And our job is to push, push, push  until we get that  unbelievable reaction from Earl.  We knew old Earl. 
[00:17:00]  We knew new Earl.  I knew new Earl was a farce.  It was a fake Earl.  And I knew that this program  could bring out the old Earl.  Right.  And that's what it did, man.  We hadn't seen that Earl  in a long time.  And, you know,  it started with him, you know,  and maybe some of the guys  that work for Earl  and Ron Affez  messing up our,  messing up our Grammy audio  because they were in our office  hanging out.  Yeah.  That's how it started.  But then Anthony and I  and Jimmy,  we know that, 
[00:17:30]  you know,  if you push Earl enough,  you get an unbelievable reaction,  which makes great radio.  A lot of fun.  We were going for  really good radio yesterday.  But now I'm hearing  he might be in some trouble  with the company and stuff.  And I'm here to say,  I'm here to say,  just leave Earl alone.  We'll leave him alone.  He'll go back to doing  a great job for Ron Affez.  Just leave him alone.  What are they talking?  Because he threw a mic?  But Steve and Ben are like,  you know,  Earl can't be doing that.  I'm like,  are you kidding me?  He was taunted.  You guys knew damn well,  even though it wasn't Steve or Ben,  it was Danny.  And I praise Danny 
[00:18:00]  for coming up with this idea.  But Steve and Ben know better  that if there's going to be a box  sitting outside the studio  with Black Earl's name on it,  knowing there's a ton of boxes  around here  because all these people  are moving out,  and in that box  that says Black Earl  is actual Black Earl stuff,  Earl's going to lose his mind.  I thought Steve was coming in.  No, he doesn't want to.  Damn it.  He doesn't want to.  Ben and Steve,  they're in the office.  So,  what are they doing,  those two fairies? 
[00:18:30]  I want to talk to Steve about this.  Then how about this?  Steve, the boss wants you.  Because Steve had some  strong opinions about this  about an hour ago.  You know he was going to react.  Yeah.  That's your new  walk-on music,  by the way.  Glad you got that in there,  Than.  Thank you. 
[00:19:00]  Go ahead.  You guys knew.  You guys know better  than Anthony and I,  even,  because you've worked  closer with him.  We've known Earl  for a while,  and we've seen him  do that stuff before,  but he didn't have  a position as the  executive producer  of a national talk show  before.  So,  I guess the thought process,  at least on my end,  is maybe you'd mature  a little bit  and you wouldn't react  that way.  There's plenty of times  where,  what?  I say what,  go ahead,  go ahead.  Steve,  if someone had a box  with my name on it  and my actual stuff,  I would have opened 
[00:19:30]  the window and thrown  it on 57th Street,  not thinking about my job  or how the company  would take that.  I don't think I would've.  I don't think I would've  at all.  You would've sat there  and laughed?  No,  I wouldn't have laughed  at all.  I would've gotten...  You probably would've  went into your studio  slamming doors  and all sorts of things.  I wouldn't break equipment  and I wouldn't...  That's all I'm saying.  I think the bit  was really funny,  but for you guys  to think that Earl  wasn't going to react  is crazy.  We've known the guy  for seven years.  I would hope he wouldn't.  Let's put it that way.  I just,  you know...  You could hope.  That ain't going to happen,  though.  We know Earl.  You know, 
[00:20:00]  it's a different environment.  It's a different environment  that he's in.  I mean,  I disagree.  I'm not saying I'm right,  but I know my job  and Anthony does a great job  with this, too.  Obviously,  we will just keep  poking and poking  and poking and poking  until we get a reaction.  I understand that.  And I've been on the...  When I was on Ron and Fez,  I was watching Earl.  I'm like,  we're not getting the reaction.  So we just kept poking  and poking and poking.  And it sucks being  on the end of that.  And then,  blam!  He slams the mic 
[00:20:30]  and he runs out of here.  That's what we were going for.  It stinks being on the end  of that needling.  But you have to just learn  restraint or get up  and walk out of the room  and just at least calm down  and not throw things around  and not freak out.  Well,  all I'm saying today is  I'm asking Washington  just leave Earl alone.  Let him go back  to doing the good job  he does for Ron and Fez.  We had a lot of fun  with him yesterday.  We needled him.  We poked him.  We got some great reactions,  some great radio.  And we have to take  part of the blame there. 
[00:21:00]  All right?  Gotcha.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Let's go.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  That is so good.  There's bees.  There's a bear.  That is so good.  Joe in Jersey, what's up?  How you doing, Opie?  I just want to say  now that you signed up  oh, what's her name? 
[00:21:30]  Oprah Winfrey.  Oprah Winfrey.  Now you guys can do  Howie Math.  Everything that she brings in,  you guys can take credit for.  Yeah, we love the Howie Math.  Yep.  We're big supporters  of the Howie Math.  It makes yourself  look really good.  Yeah.  Okay, guys, punch it out.  According to the Howie Math,  we have brought  well over 4 million subscribers  to XM Satellite Radio.  4 million because of  the Opie and Anthony show.  And now because of Oprah,  we're going to have  even more subs  that we can take credit for.  Howie Math, I love it.  Let's say hi to  Ken in Binghamton.  Ken? 
[00:22:00]  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I was just wondering  if there's any updates  on the Club Soda deal.  Club Soda made the papers  again today.  He's got a lawyer.  If you Google his name,  Club Soda Kenny  or Opie and Anthony  because we're mentioning  the article again,  you'll read the latest article.  But he's got a lawyer.  Do we have the article  in front of us?  No.  No.  No.  No.  Wow.  Wait two seconds.  I guess that wasn't  important enough  for the show today  to see if there was  an update on Club Soda Kenny.  Well, if we talked  about it yesterday, 
[00:22:30]  maybe that would have...  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Who got this?  Hey, listen.  Stan handed that to you  like Mr. Hand  handed out the test.  F.  F.  You know,  we can't say too much  until we know  our pal Kenny's  going to be all right.  But I was talking  to Kenny a little bit  yesterday.  Hi.  And he was like,  you know,  this is a freedom  of speech issue.  Yeah.  I will be taking this 
[00:23:00]  to the Supreme Court  if I have to.  Oh.  The new Lenny Bruce.  It's just hilarious  to hear Club Soda Kenny  and freedom of speech  in the same sentence.  Yeah.  And he's like,  giving me like,  you know,  his take on this,  how it's freedom  of speech  and everyone has  the right  to freedom of speech.  Freedom of speech.  I don't mean to make,  you know,  light,  but it was really funny  to hear him saying that  on the phone yesterday. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Kenny actually said to me,  I may not agree  with what you say,  but I'll die  for your right  to say it.  We're in his corner,  obviously.  Of course we are.  He's just not a smart man.  No.  Give me liberty  or give me bell.  Wait.  I will laugh so hard  if you become  some kind of  freedom of speech martyr. 
[00:24:00]  I know,  him and Cindy Sheehan  doing a tour together.  Right.  And she sees his act  and realizes  he's reprehensible.  I talked to him  yesterday though  for a while  and he's very grateful  to all the people  who have been  supporting him and stuff.  He said it's nice to know  that people really  are concerned.  Yeah, people love the guy.  So he really is  a nice big likable dummy.  Of course he is.  But maybe someone  can get the latest article  up on whackbag.com.  But basically  in this one  it talks about  how he's got  a really,  really good attorney  and the attorney  thinks that he was 
[00:24:30]  well within his means  to perform at a comedy club  under another name  and do what he did.  And Kenny's  feeling good  about the attorney  he picked.  So that's the update  on Club Soda.  Kenny, good.  And it's 22 years  on the 4th  the guy should get  his pension.  Almost 25 years  because he had  two years  on another 4th  so I think  almost 25 years  when he picked  the pension  from his wife  and kids  because he told  some dirty jokes  at a nightclub.  Yeah, beautiful.  You'd rob a wife  and two children  of that pension  because he told  tasteless jokes? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go to Russ  in Iowa.  Russ.  Hey, how you guys  doing?  Hey.  Hey, Opie?  Yeah.  Man, I tried  getting through  the Ron and Fez  yesterday  when you come on  with the Earl deal.  Man, you guys  know damn well  you guys  done this shit.  You know damn  well you did.  We just admitted that.  Well, I know  you admitted it  but you kind of  half admit it.  Well, we'll take  some response.  Half admit it.  We are fully admitting  that those buttons  we could have  pushed those buttons  blindfolded. 
[00:25:30]  Exactly.  Yeah.  But it started  with him  or someone  from his staff  messing up  our program.  Right.  The guy in the office.  And then these dummies  that just don't get  how a radio show  is done.  I've just had it  with those people  because now they're  saying I'm on a power trip  because I made Earl  apologize on Ron and Fez.  I was trying to make  good radio.  I don't give a shit  if a black girl  ever fucking apologizes  to me.  Who was saying  you're on a power trip?  But a bunch of people  on Wackbag.  How do they actually  put that on a message board? 
[00:26:00]  Hey.  Like do they write it down  or something?  Or is there some type  of a plan?  I think that  Opie's on a power trip.  For him to sit there  and make Earl  apologize  just shows  that his ego  is getting in the way.  Dot dot dot.  Fuck you Opie.  Ladies and gentlemen  angry typing guy.  Angry typing guy. 
[00:26:30]  I love angry typing guy.  He's taking what I wrote  out of context.  Of course you should have  made Earl apologize.  You should have made him  grovel even more.  I don't think you hit him  hard enough.  But here's the deal.  Whether you think  I'm on a power trip or not.  I mean yesterday  with the black girl thing.  I don't give a shit  if he apologizes  or any of that shit.  I don't care.  It made for good radio  because he was in  a very uncomfortable position.  I love when people  are in uncomfortable positions.  Right.  And make him apologize  in front of everyone like that. 
[00:27:00]  That's just good radio.  Like holy shit.  Is he stupid enough  to apologize?  That's the reaction  I'm getting.  People don't get it.  Or going for.  I think you should have  made him admit  racial inferiority.  But for people to think  that I got this huge ego  and I needed to take time  on the Ron and Fez show  because I'm on some  kind of power trip  and I needed Earl  to apologize  is so ridiculous  that I get so frustrated  reading this shit  on Whack Bag.  I think I laid into Earl  more than anyone else.  I think listening back  I tore into him  more than anybody else did. 
[00:27:30]  I called him a lot.  I almost called him  a lying sack of cunt.  I know.  But I used that line already.  I like doing that.  That's kind of hack.  Yeah.  But he was lying  at the beginning  of his little conversation there.  That's how it started.  We asked him  if he was in the office.  He said no.  And then it just went from there  when in fact  he was in the office.  And yeah.  Anything after that  when we really were  busting his balls  was to get a reaction  out of him.  And it worked.  And it was hysterical  to listen to that guy  lose his fucking mind. 
[00:28:00]  Right.  Love it.  And that's what it was  that's what we were  going for yesterday  and it was a lot of fun.  Yeah.  To start really looking  into it and saying  I have a  you know  it proves I'm on a  power trip and all that.  You gotta calm down  with that bullshit.  It's ridiculous.  It just shows  you don't know this show  at all.  You know it was  really funny.  I was listening to  Ron and Fez  and after that was over  I guess Ronnie  was talking about  the fact that  at 11.01  I am walking  out the front door  and he's laughing 
[00:28:30]  because I leave  right after the show  but he's walking  in the front door  when his show  is on the air.  It's like after 11  technically he's  on the air  and I see him  downstairs  in front of the building.  I walk out  and I'm like  hey Ronnie  how you doing?  Like hey Anthony  what's up?  You got kind of  a bee's nest up there.  Ah yeah I heard  I heard  I'm going to have  to run  or Fez is going  to have to  do the show  by himself  for a couple  of minutes.  He goes  I don't know  what happens  first. 
[00:29:00]  Does Anthony  leave  or do I get here?  Right.  Like he  it's the same time  but at least  I get here  an hour in advance  and try to do  a little show  preparation.  Right.  Am I out  right after the show?  You're derned  tootin'.  That's because  we have a really  good staff now.  Yes.  We don't have to  stick around too long.  Not only do we  have a good staff  but we now have  cameras where we  can watch them  work.  That studio cam  by the way  was on 24 hours.  Office cam.  It has been on  office cam.  Yeah because we  got two of them now.  Was on all night long 
[00:29:30]  and there was  never less than  when I was watching  there were hundreds  of people in there  watching the office.  Hundreds of people  going what was that?  Who's that?  They saw people  walk in by the way  last night.  Someone walked in  grabbed a magazine  and walked out  and you know  it's not Red Book  that is sitting  on the couch  over there.  It is  hardcore porno  so I don't know  what's going on.  Someone dipping  into the porn?  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  We have a name  don't we?  Yeah we have a name.  We even know  who did it?  Do we know?  Alright.  We'll be watching  that person very closely.  We'll watch.  Yes.  We have over  100 people at a time  watching that office.  200 eyeballs  peering in  on the office.  Alright.  Dominic in Jersey.  Dominic.  Yo what's going on guys?  Good morning.  I think it was great  that opening on  we're in there  defending their show  and there's Anthony  hiding from the black man  in his car.  Come on.  Just like in the movies?  That was a great commute  yesterday. 
[00:30:30]  I called Ron and Fez's show  pretty much right  when I pulled out  of the garage  because Earl  was just annoying me  and listeners  were annoying me.  Ron and Fez's listeners  saying that  Earl you stuck up  for yourself.  You did a good job  and Earl's like  well I'm just not going  to step into their traps  and take any of their  traps?  What?  So I had a call right away  and the segment ended  as I pulled into my driveway.  It was a perfect commute.  Nice.  Get me occupied.  Alright.  Let's go to Sean  in Hackensack. 
[00:31:00]  Sean.  Yo what's going on guys?  Happy birthday Jimmy.  Just wanted to say  first of all  the black girl thing  and it was fucking  hysterical but  Rob brought up  something on the  Ron and Fez show  saying he wanted  to know  he wanted to get  a stopwatch  to see who would  leave the show  as soon as it was over  and who would get  out faster.  Would it be Anthony  or would it be Ron?  What do you think Anthony?  Do you think you rush  out that much faster?  I think me.  No you would need  one of those  photo finish  cameras.  Yeah yeah. 
[00:31:30]  There's no contest.  And what is actually  leaving?  Is it out the front  door of this  studio?  Out of the elevator?  Out of the front  door of the building?  I think it's out  the front door  of the building.  I think it's out  the studio  down the elevator  right out the front  freaking door.  Oh I am out of here  believe me.  You think you got a beat?  Yeah definitely.  No doubt.  Sometimes I got to  stick around for  Ben's inane meetings  about guests  that we're never  going to get.  Guys what do you  think?  George Clooney? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah Ben.  George Clooney.  George fucking  Clooney on the list.  Pacino.  Al Pacino.  Keanu Reeves.  Yes.  Pacino.  Keanu Reeves.  Put it to any  sit center and  puts a check mark  next to it.  Check.  Check.  Okay.  Fantastic.  And we never see  these people ever  ever.  The list of people  we have no shot  at getting.  It's like great.  Okay who's coming  in?  Bob Kelly.  Great.  Okay.  Good.  Good.  We got Voss on  a phoner from  Cincinnati.  All right.  I checked him  too.  Thank God. 
[00:32:30]  You should see  the list of  celebrities.  A-listers that  we get run by us  by Ben and I  just stand there  and go what are  you talking about?  Yeah I think  Monday we're  talking to somebody  from Survivor 5.  There you go.  That's who we're  getting.  Not even the winner  of Survivor 5 by  the way.  Yeah it's it.  Not even the winner.  Who do we got?  That was a joke  or an attempt at a  joke.  Oh I thought you  were serious.  My mom watches  Survivor 5.  You should be  excited.  I think the best  guest we had as far 
[00:33:00]  as and it was a  phoner because usually  they're phoners and  don't come in and  stuff.  Yeah.  And I'm sorry it  wasn't Ozzy being in  the studio.  I'm talking about  celebrity status.  Samuel L.  Jackson.  Of course.  I think him being a  real star.  A lot of movies.  Movies I enjoy.  He was a good one.  That when they said  he was going to be on  I said bullshit.  And there he was.  Let me tell you  something about  Samuel L.  Jackson.  Eugene Levy call  which we got them  together.  That was in the  midst of a media  blitz where they  were calling 80  stations.  Oh I know. 
[00:33:30]  Don't get me wrong.  I don't think it  was because he  said oh oh and  hey motherfucker.  I'm being on that  show.  No.  They were pushing a  shitty movie.  Ozzy came in and  spent 45 minutes with  us and would have  hung longer if we  decided to go longer.  So I gotta say Ozzy  was much better and I  am biased but.  But I am not as big  an Ozzy fan as you.  But he's a famous  guy man.  If I saw Ozzy  Osbourne and Samuel  L.  Jackson on the  sidewalk together  could only get a  picture and autograph  with one of them it  would be Samuel L.  Jackson.  No not me. 
[00:34:00]  I like Samuel a lot  but again.  You're just racist.  No no no no I'm  not.  I don't like blacks but  that's not what I'm  talking about.  I love Samuel L.  Jackson he's great but  he hasn't been he's  been famous since what  the late 80s despite  he was doing you know  I don't care how long  how long of a stint  it's been since he's  had a huge movie.  The movies he's been  in Goodfellas and  Pulp Fiction that's  that's all you need in  my book to be huge.  Ozzy was the best  guest we've had I got  to say in studio.  No 45 minutes. 
[00:34:30]  Very surprising to me  the listeners and  everyone.  If we had a bigger  story if we had Tom  Cruz I would say that  that trumped Ozzy I  mean I'm not a dope but  I mean Samuel Jackson  to me on a phone with  Eugene Levy during a  media blitz and they  also right after us  would have called a  zoo crew like getting  Ozzy in studio is  almost impossible.  I think the  accomplishment there  is good.  Yeah but it wasn't  personal.  It wasn't the best in  studio guest not even  not even close.  Who's better?  You can't even think  of think give me one  highlight from the  Ozzy interview.  I don't suck dicks  Jimmy. 
[00:35:00]  That was pretty good.  He was hilarious.  That wasn't that  wasn't the interview  though.  That was better radio  than Ozzy.  I'm sorry to say but  he did.  Wow.  That story about his  it's probably a bit  from the stage which is  funny.  Whatever but it was as  far as in studio  guests that that was  more entertaining.  Ozzy had one or two  good lines and that  was it.  It was interesting to  have him in.  Do we know we're  never going to change  his mind when any  Ozzy stuff comes up.  Because it's inaccurate.  He was very funny.  He was on fire.  He was fucking  hilarious from the  minute he walked in. 
[00:35:30]  I thought Ozzy was  great.  Howie Mandel is a  stand up.  Of course he was  funny.  But not one of the  best in studio guests  we've had.  Who was better?  You're saying Howie and  I'm saying not on  Howie Mandel.  I would tell you if I  thought he was better.  I would be honest.  I don't want to  fight today Jimmy.  We don't have to  fight but you can't  you're just saying  Ozzy to be  disagreeable.  Let's hug.  Listen fuckface.  I'm saying Samuel L.  Jackson.  Dice gave his better  stuff.  Jim Brewer gave his  better stuff.  But comedians is  different man.  But we're just  talking about in  studio guests in  general.  Okay how about  since Satellite?  Since Satellite? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Better guest than Ozzy?  I haven't been here in  five years.  Telstar?  Or what Satellite are  you talking about?  Sputnik?  Since Sputnik.  He's the biggest  one.  The Booker.  He's one of the  biggest guests we've  had.  Yeah.  Yeah okay.  I'll give you that.  One of the biggest.  Of course.  That doesn't necessarily  mean the like.  I was very excited to  speak to Samuel L.  Jackson.  So was I.  He gave us a better  interview of Samuel  Jackson on the phone.  And don't leave the L  out.  That's disrespectful.  I said Samuel  Jackson. 
[00:36:30]  Samuel L.  Jackson.  I said Samuel with  the L.  It's not.  It's Samuel L.  Are you trying to say  there's two L's?  Yes it's Samuel L.  L.  Which I don't know  what it stands for.  I just kind of slurred  it all together.  Jackson.  Samuel Jackson.  Samuel Jackson is one  of the best guests we've  ever had.  And he didn't give us a  better interview.  He gave us a nice  interview but it was  completely the same shit  he would have told  anybody else.  He was cursing and it  was great.  I'd be more impressed 
[00:37:00]  if he was in studio.  If they had to juice the  end of the studio.  You're jaded Mr.  HBO.  We don't know better.  Jaded Mr.  HBO.  Mike how long is  who you are?  Not jaded.  Just right.  Hi Mike.  Hi Mike.  Hey what's up boys?  What's up?  I got in my truck  seven minutes ago  just to hear  Jimmy I love you  just to hear  Jimmy sucking the  dick of Ozzy Osbourne.  Again right?  Jimmy please  please please  enough with the  we all love him  we get it  he's a great guy 
[00:37:30]  but come on now  Jimmy.  Did you hear how the  discussion started though  sir?  Yes sir.  Sort of.  Mike.  Mike.  I'm a good listener.  Mike.  Yes.  Just admit Ozzy is  great we don't want to  go there today.  I'm going there.  Jimmy you did nothing  I just admit Ozzy is  the greatest thing ever.  That's all Jimmy wants  to know.  I challenge anybody  to present who's been  a more interesting guest  since he's been on  or a more honest guest  for 45 minutes.  Jimmy you  creep him out.  You creep most people  out that's not a reflection  so what he gets good 
[00:38:00]  taste.  You're idle.  Huh?  You're idle.  You creep him out.  It's kind of creepy  how much you defend him.  I defend him  yes I do.  It's really creepy man.  Why is it creepy?  Is it creepy that the  pets defend this show?  No.  It just is what it is.  Yeah but look  it gets all excited though.  It does.  It's just Ozzy.  Because I get excited  I got heroes but I don't  like I don't know  it's creepy.  Why Ozzy?  Why is Ozzy so great  in your mind?  I don't know.  Like it's creepy Jimmy  no offense.  No it's not.  Because if anyone ever  brings another argument 
[00:38:30]  onto the table  you get almost  you get really really  upset.  I'm sincere.  I'm not making it up.  I like I know it's hip  to like other guys  and that's cool  but I like Ozzy the best.  That's it.  And it hands it down.  But why?  I don't know.  It's something that goes  way back with you.  It's not just the music.  Because I've had heroes  growing up but it's like  if someone wants to trash  Kurt Cobain or something  I'm like alright whatever.  You get defensive though.  You don't like it.  To a point but not  I don't think I ever get  You also didn't grow up  on Cobain either.  Like you like him  you respect him  and you love him  but you didn't grow up on him  he wasn't like a part of you  or your whole thing. 
[00:39:00]  Did Ozzy's music  help you through something?  Not really.  I don't think so.  I was an ass.  I was a melodramatic  suburban yutz.  No there's something there though.  There's some kind of connection  where you're like  wow this guy did this for me  growing up or whatever  that I will defend him  to his death.  I think the personality  the guy's honest.  He's an honest rock star.  He's non-pompous.  That's what I always loved  about him more than anything  and he's funny.  He's a really funny dude  and he tells the truth.  He doesn't have social messages.  But you truly get upset  if someone trashes Ozzy.  Like if someone trashes  Kurt Cobain  I'm like alright whatever  you don't know what you're  talking about.  Yeah I'll get a little annoyed 
[00:39:30]  but you really get upset.  I get annoyed  because for so many years  I've been dealing with  the fucking Rolling Stone  mentality in music.  I've been dealing with this  for so many years.  What's the Rolling Stone mentality?  That this band is hip  and that they'd rather put  Michael Stipes on the cover  than Sabbath.  Michael Stipes is a bad example.  He went away many years ago now.  A million of them.  They're still doing music  but they're nothing  like they used to.  That's what I'm talking about.  I'm saying what I've been  dealing with for years.  Rolling Stones is a better argument  because they're still  throwing them on the cover 
[00:40:00]  of everything.  Yeah but the Stones  are the Stones.  I can't argue with the Rolling Stones  being on the cover of anything.  They're the fucking Stones.  I mean you can't argue with that.  That I got no problem with.  It's the just the idea  like Rolling Stone magazine  and how like they wouldn't let them  in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  It's that fucking hip  with the now mentality.  Like yeah man Green Day is great  but Sabbath.  Hold on can I tell you something  about that because I have  a lot of bands I love.  I could care less if they're  in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  I don't really care.  To me it's like that whole  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Didn't you go with us  in Cleveland?  No I refused.  Okay. 
[00:40:30]  It was Kenny and Ben  and I can think it was Steve.  That place is the biggest joke.  I was embarrassed to be  in that place.  But as an artist.  So like I love U2  and Nirvana.  If Nirvana never gets  into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  I don't give a shit.  But as an artist  you get sick and tired  of seeing like when you know  like when you judge other artists  and you're like you guys  are judging like more radio  I would judge more stand-ups.  You get tired of the same  fucking shit being praised  the same fucking way.  It's like you know what I mean  that's what gets annoying  and then when something  you know is good 
[00:41:00]  and something you know  is innovative  and they ignore it  because they didn't like  the ideology it was coming from.  That's what annoys me.  But I think it's cool  that like mainstream society  does ignore the like  you know like Kurt Cobain  and stuff to a point.  Like I think it's cool.  I don't want like  some of my bands.  The things they pay attention to  kind of stink all the time.  Yeah that's true.  I mean you can look at it  Do you want Ozzy  alright do you want Ozzy's music  being played in commercials?  Maybe it is.  I don't know.  I think it is.  I wouldn't care at this point  because again  I mean it's from 68 to now  it wouldn't bother me.  I mean you know what I mean  if it was like 19...  Would that be cool for you 
[00:41:30]  or would that be like  oh what are they doing  Ozzy's music.  I don't know.  Johnson's baby shampoo.  No more tears.  Tears.  Tears.  No I don't care about that.  I love to see him  overexposed on MTV.  I love it.  Yeah he's the fucking hilarious.  But he had his time.  He got like three or four  great years there  where he was on the cover  of everything.  Absolutely.  You know what's sad though?  You should put that kind of  energy in respect  to people like teachers  and volunteer workers  for the homeless.  Dude when one of those 
[00:42:00]  fucking bums sings  Crazy Train  or fucking sings  something like  Under the Sun  I will be happy  to like teachers  until then  eat my ass  and give me more Ozzy.  But someday  you gotta get into this further  maybe think about it  because you get so defensive  I think there's a good story there.  Probably not.  I'm like a cancer  so I've always been fiercely  loyal and defensive  to shit I like.  I don't change  I don't adjust well  to new shit  and when I like something  I fucking like it  end of discussion  and that's that.  He digs right in  like a tick.  Right. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah I love it.  I wish like  I grew up with Nirvana's music.  I wish  but I was in my mid-twenties  when I discovered that.  Right.  I would have loved a band  like that growing up.  Are you kidding me?  You know?  Hmm.  But instead we got  a lot of shitty music  when we were growing up.  I don't know  The Clash.  70s.  It was pretty good.  That was kind of like  you know anti-establishment.  When we really started  figuring out what music  was all about  Zeppelin  Sex Pistols.  Zeppelin was already done  as far as new music  and all that.  I'm talking about a band  that had new music  coming out. 
[00:43:00]  We were stuck  with all that 80s shit.  Yeah but the beginning  of the 80s  wasn't like bad.  You had to sort  through a lot of the shit  but there was some  good underground  like rebellious shit  going on back then.  Ramones.  Yeah.  Clash.  Ramones.  The Ramones.  Ramones I want  to be sedated.  Steve and the Yellowstones.  I love that band. 
[00:43:30]  Because one of the first bands  I did discover  was Black Sabbath  and also Zeppelin though.  You discovered them?  Wow.  I mean you know  On the tarmac  at Idlewild?  In my life.  I mean people always say  wow I discovered  the you know  the Stones  when I was whatever age  or Zeppelin.  It was between  Black Sabbath and Zeppelin  when I was growing up  and I decided to go  you know the other way  and I got into Zeppelin  more than Sabbath.  But I was listening  to all the Sabbath stuff  when I was growing up.  So you'd be  another part of it  And then there was  somewhere along the line  I just gave up  and I didn't follow  the band anymore 
[00:44:00]  and then when Ozzy  started doing his solo stuff  it was like  Blizzard of Oz I loved.  But then after that  I was like eh.  Well you have to realize too  that when you're growing up  like that was accepted.  Zeppelin  like when you listen  to the radio  I used to put on N.E.W.  and want to fucking  drive into a pole.  Of course.  You could never get  Sabbath on the radio  or Ozzy.  Once in a while  you'd get Warp Pigs.  I'm with you there  because Zeppelin  had a lot more radio hits  obviously.  A lot of bands did.  But that was embarrassing  being a Zeppelin fan  because then when you  throw on Zeppelin 3  or Zeppelin 2  and realize holy shit 
[00:44:30]  there are a million  great songs that radio  could be playing  instead we get  rock and roll  over and over again  we get Stairway  obviously  and you know the hits  that you've heard  a million times  but you get into  like Zeppelin 3  that's one of the  greatest albums ever made.  But I'm saying  every year Zeppelin  was voted  I mean I love Zeppelin  not knocking Zeppelin  but every year  Stairway to Heaven  was voted number one  and it's like as a fan  when you're trying to hear  your fucking band's music  and you can't hear it  because they're playing  that shit again  you start to resent  other bands.  But being a fan of Zeppelin  I hated that they had 
[00:45:00]  Stairway to Heaven  highlighting Stairway to Heaven  year after year  after year after year  of course I did  of course.  Okay.  But there's still a line  between something so overplayed  and something never played  which is also a statement  about commercial radio.  And by the way  Coda I hate it.  Thank you.  Zeppelin's Coda album.  I was never a Zeppelin fan.  No.  At all?  A couple of tunes  but was never like  one of those  whoa rabid  you know Zeppelin fans.  I went through my  who phase 
[00:45:30]  where I just  you know  loves the who  and then I was  a southern rock guy  you know  hooked up with that crowd  where it was about  Skinner and Charlie Daniels  the outlaw  Molly Hatchet  shit like that.  ZZ Top  ZZ Top  I saw one of those guys  in a restaurant in LA  when I was out there.  Which one?  I don't know  the one with the beard  the one who kind of  looks homeless  well  the guy that doesn't  have the beard  is Frank Beard  his last name is Beard  isn't that odd?  That's how you figure  that shit out  that's nutty 
[00:46:00]  crazy  but the other two guys  last name is Clean Shaven  oh stop  it's not you  of course it isn't  hey yeah  you know what  someone suggested  that the Travis Tritt interview  was one of the best  interviews we've done  that was a good one  I heard that was a good one too  you weren't here for that one?  no I was out  I gotta be honest Jimmy  that was a really  really good out  I heard he was great  and the weird thing is  we didn't know shit  about Travis Tritt  and he didn't know shit  about us  didn't have to  but on some level  it just worked  just men talking  if you got McCartney  or somebody in here  and someone said  who's the biggest guest 
[00:46:30]  of course  that would then be McCartney  biggest guess  it's hard to deny  that Ozzy's probably  right up there  Samuel Jackson  I would not give it  the best in studio appearance  that's all  I was talking about  personally  for me  that was a thrill  me too  because he's such a  Samuel L. Jackson  Samuel Jackson  Samuel L. Jackson  Sam Jackson was good  Samuel Jackson  Sammy Jackson  I'm doing the two L's  Samuel L. Jackson  it's the lazy  Long Island accent  Lazy L 
[00:47:00]  Samuel L. Jackson  Samuel L. Jackson  Samuel L. Jackson  All for a deuce  what's up  All for a deuce  hey boys  hey man  I just want to  I never got to get in  for the Ron and  Jesper yesterday  but for all you  new listeners  Anthony and Jimmy  had their obvious  sense of humor  and everything  Opie is the  black fucking ninja  sense of humor  guy  this trick alone  is an Opie  freaking best of reel  that just never  got noticed  and yesterday 
[00:47:30]  especially  I mean you guys  pulled this  I give a treat  to all the pal talkers  every morning  well I started  yesterday afternoon  I do my black ninja moves  for the pal talk  oh a little martial arts  going on  in front of the camera  this morning  you saw some of that  yeah I did  I just kind of  looked away  I was like  what the fuck  is that  looks creepy  but Opie  when you sat there  and busted Earl  and you were  busting on him  for however long  and all of a sudden  you heard the  I don't think  you've thanked me  for anything  and you have Earl 
[00:48:00]  thanking you  for everything  all the way back  to like 1984  after beating him up  all for a deuce  thanks for getting it  like you hear that  yesterday  and if you sit there  and think that's because  I'm on some kind of  power trip  you're nuts  you're nuts  because people at home  are like  oh no you didn't  that's the reaction  I was getting  no you didn't  you're not going to ask Earl  to apologize  for everything  you've done  for him  that was the  that was the second  best fight  you turned around  and made Earl  apologize  he's probably  apologizing to his 
[00:48:30]  landlord and the  trash guy  right  you had him  apologizing to  everybody  right  that's just  good radio  I mean  don't mix the two  Opie pull that  out of left  fucking field  and it was just  like oh no  you all  it was like  it was  it was enjoying  the cringe humor  that Opie loves  to enjoy  you just  you don't see it  coming but when  it happens  it's kind of weird  I can't hang up  on this caller  for some reason  look the mouse  is around  there must be  a technical glitch  yeah I just want 
[00:49:00]  I just want people  to know I'm not  on a power trip  I just can't  hit the hang up  I've been listening  to you since day one  all right all right  all for juice  thank you I  appreciate the  support  thank you sir  I don't care much  and I'll have to  take the little I  get  Bill Burr is here  cool  you get a lot  that was a part  of the bit  oh I'm sorry  I don't care either  way to be honest  with you  I used to care  that is the  God's honest truth  I did  I don't care anymore  I'm a literal guy  that's my new  character  I love doing the 
[00:49:30]  radio show  someone's suggesting  the Brokeback Mountain  music and audio clips  from Ozzy and Jimmy  talking to each other  during that interview  oh very good  I don't know that music  oh the music  yeah I've not heard  come on  it's the sound of  dick and ass  by the way finally  got distracted  because the Brokeback  commercial was just  up on the TV  oh really yeah  hard to talk with  a boner isn't it  yes it is  boner I would have  said hard on  but I said hard  in the first one 
[00:50:00]  I downloaded  some clips  I downloaded  I ripped them  off of a  bootleg DVD  of Brokeback Mountain  and every so often  if someone gets  a little rambunctious  on Pal Talk  I'll just throw on  the clips of them  kissing  I saw  the montage  it's just  and it's a very short  portion of the movie  that they're actually  with each other  doing man on man  sex things  but I put them  all together  and when anyone  mouths off on Pal Talk  I'll just pop that  clip up and they'll  have to sit there  and watch  I saw that yesterday 
[00:50:30]  and it was a type  of man on man  kissing like  it wasn't gentle  like when I kiss a girl  I take my thumb  and forefinger  and I hold her chin  right  but this is like  the type of man  kissing where  like you know  you hug a man  you do this on his back  yeah  that was the type  of man kissing  it was that as a kiss  yeah the rough  they had grabbed  like yeah the one guy  grabs the other one  by the shoulders  and kind of shakes him  and throws him  against the wall  and they just start  making out  that's one of the  best clips in the movie  when the wife  comes to the door 
[00:51:00]  and looks out the door  and catches her husband  kissing this guy  making out  on the side  of the stairway  her face  is priceless  you just rewind it  and watch that  over and over  she's just like  oh my god  my husband's  a fucking faggot  and I live in Wyoming  when the DVR  the DVR  I'm so used to  saying DVR  when the DVD  comes out  they have to have  some kind of like  gay filter feature  oh you think  they'll have the  gay filter  and just cut that out  well my movies  on demand  on my cable  they have family 
[00:51:30]  versions of  right  of movies  that shouldn't  have a family  version  do they just  cut it out  or will they  put something else  in like them  talking hey  how's the truck  running  and then have  the wife  looking horrified  on as they're  checking the  carburetor  and air cleaner  it's a bad  fucking ADR  the voice over  they just keep  reshowing her eyes  and it's like  what do you want  to do  let's go  praise the lord  eyes are wide  she can't believe  the goodness  of her husband  he's a man  of the lord 
[00:52:00]  fantastic  let me walk  away  in shock  from the doorway  right  because my husband  has such a good  friend  he's talking  to a picture  of Jesus  I can't quit  you  you think  they'll come out  with a less gay  version when the  DVD comes out  they're doing  all sorts of  crazy things  with DVDs  you never know  I don't know  probably more  gay actually  we gotta get  back to music  scratch and sniff  Nathan from  South Carolina  hey what's  going on  hey listen  Opie doesn't  know dick  about music  I mean he's  trashing the 80s  but all the 
[00:52:30]  I mean the 80s  were one of the  most inventive  times for music  I mean that's  who Nirvana  was copying  when they  Nirvana was  created in the 80s  and Nirvana  was  they were emulating  the meat  the 80s  you had to sort  through a lot  of shit  to get to the  good stuff  maybe not so much  at the beginning  of the 80s  because everyone  was so happy  that disco  was fucking  done  because of it  because of the  music that was  coming out  in the early 80s  but then as time  went on in the 80s  and by the end  of the 80s 
[00:53:00]  I'm sorry  99% of that  stuff was shit  and that's why  Nirvana just  destroyed  because music  was ready for a  band like Nirvana  they were so sick  of the power  ballads  and the hair  bands  and all that  you know what  Nathan  I'll tell you  this much  we're never  going to agree  because there are  people out there  right now  going holy  you guys are  nuts  music really  got good  in the 90s  and everything  before that  sucked  and then you'll  get someone  that said  hey  music only  started getting  good in 2000  I read something  in a book once 
[00:53:30]  and it was very  simple  every generation  wants to be  the last  generation  they think  every generation  before them  sucked  and every generation  that comes  after them  sucks  what about  Husker Du  and all the  bands that  didn't hit it  but great  college bands  Husker Du  shut up  Husker Du  Husker  Husker Du  what are you  doing  if you want  to see  Wall of Voodoo  what about  Bad Brains  and all the  I mean  exactly  no one cares  about it  if you would have  said something  like the Pixies  I would have  listened to you  Husker Du 
[00:54:00]  you know what sir  you ought to find  another friend  with a cowboy hat  and suck each other's  cocks to the  safety dance  you guys are just  victims of  commercial radio  that's what you're  yeah man  no  do you like  some underground  stuff  come on man  I'm serious  that is not true  that's not true  I happen to like  Madonna videos  I like a lot of  things that were  underplayed  when I talk  I've talked  about the  rotting plums 
[00:54:30]  man  or thimble  or what about  the wrenches  and it's like  what  who  shut up  you know  I  every once in a while  I'll get into a  discussion about music  and I'll ask this  question  and it's really  simple  rank  the  the decades  in your life  to me  the 80s were the best  no  to me  better than the 70s  and this is my opinion  because everyone's  going to have  different answers  but this is what  I go  70s  wait for what  music  or just life 
[00:55:00]  in general  music  20s  music  the 20s  I say  they were roaring  in my life  yeah really  I only go back  to the 60s  pissing yourself  and barely  by the way  I like the 60s  man  I didn't have to do  anything  they fed me  I could piss myself  while I laid down  and slept  I mean you've been  around long enough  to hear music  from all these  decades  so how would you  rank the decades  and I go 70s  I don't think  they'll ever beat  the 70s 
[00:55:30]  wow  with the variety  and the  a lot of disco  in the end  of the 70s  I'm not talking  about pop  I'm talking  about rock  basically  rock music  60s were damn  good too  I mean you get  the Beatles  I go 70s  this is what I do  I go 70s  90s  80s  1000s  whatever  2000  the decade  we're in  and then the 60s  you know what  the odd thing  is about the  decades though  they don't go  on the zeros  they go on the  fives  especially with  music  they go on the  fives  what do you mean  65 to 75 
[00:56:00]  75 to 85  85 to 95  that's wrong  it's June  it's June  it's June  of the sevens  I don't know  what you're saying  I know for a fact  I've talked to people  it was 72 to 82  because if you look  at music from the 60s  from 1960  and then 1969  60s music  music from 1960  is 50s music  I understand that  yeah  so 65 to 75  yeah but you can say  that about like  70s 71  was still  60s music  yeah that's what  I'm talking about  so 65 to 75 
[00:56:30]  there's a lot  more similarities  now you're confusing  my whole  but 75 to 85  doesn't work  because I mean  like Kajagoogoo  doesn't tie in  with a lot of  things in the  mid 70s  I'm not saying  it's a perfect  formula  with Led Zeppelin 4  yeah  I'm not saying  it's a perfect  formula  that's putting it  mildly  that formula  sucks baby dicks  yeah I hate it too  keep it basic  you got the 70s  alright so I'll tie in  some Led Zeppelin  with Afternoon Delight  attaboy  there you go  now you're on  to the program  how about  Melanie 
[00:57:00]  I've got a brand  new pair of  roller skates  I dare you to  name a better  song  of course  it's a good  song  all right  Cher  Gypsies  Tramps  and Thieves  there you go  fucking people  in the town  would always  look at them  and stuff  and then the  guys would  come up  and they  fuck the  women  and stuff  at night  the men  would come  around  and lay  their money  down  yeah  best interview  since coming  to XM  Gene Simmons  no  Ozzy was better  Gene with  his infomercial  interviews that  he does  and telling  everyone they  should never  get married  we get it  Gene  at this point 
[00:57:30]  we get it  you know when  you can just  walk outside  and be me  and get laid  why would you  get married  yeah Gene  we're not all  Gene Simmons  maybe that's why  yeah the average  guy can relate  to Gene Simmons  yeah  the guy  working three  jobs to make  ends meet  could relate  to you Gene  so he should  just get rid  of his wife  because there's  plenty of pussy  out there  right  while he's going  from job  to job  to job  yeah  with his wife  that has no  problem with him  fucking everybody  right  if this is the  lifestyle  you want to lead  alright Gene  he really 
[00:58:00]  is out of touch  and then  someone saying  Disturb was  the best interview  it was a very  good interview  but I wasn't  here for that  I can't really  gauge who was  the best interviewer  better  they all have  their strengths  by the end of the show  I was just saying  who I enjoyed  talking to  by the end of the show  I will find one  that was better  than nausea  that's possible  Bernie Getz  Bernie Getz  come on  as far as  compelling radio  as an animal 
[00:58:30]  Bernie Getz was great  he was up there  Travis Tritt was up there  which was a shock  Bob Saget was up there  but you don't want me  to go with a comedian  I don't want you  to go with a comedian  I'm just saying  when they're funny  in studio  I guess they do  look  Hallieman  that was great  and so was Bob Saget  alright let's just  go with compelling  is that fair  sure  whether it's  over the top  funny  well then Bernie Getz  was much more compelling  even though he was crazy  he was describing  shooting for people  that was really  that was crazy  no when I was talking  about the 60s  I wasn't talking  about the 1860s 
[00:59:00]  people  I'm not a vampire  Jesus  Michelle  yes  yeah  yes  go ahead Michelle  go  oh am I on the air  no you will be in a second  what do you want to talk about  it's a very unprofessional  radio show  usually you know  what do they do  on a real talk show  Anthony  I don't know  sometimes we'll just go  next  yeah the screener  says you'll hear  a sound  that goes  and then you'll be  on the air  with the people  the next person  you talk to 
[00:59:30]  will be  but as a talk show host  how do they set it up  let's go to Michelle  in Pennsylvania  Michelle from the car phone  who cares  they're calling  from a car phone  everyone calls  from a car phone  exactly  I just want to hear  the thud of a body  smashing off the hood  that's what used to be  a real car phone  where you couldn't  take it with you  had to be in your car  a point of a phone  yeah  they don't use that anymore  the old World War II  walkie talkie  Michelle  yes  go  you're on  okay  well I wish  you were talking  about bands 
[01:00:00]  what about ACDC  right up there  when I was growing up  yeah  ACDC  I mean  look at the commercials  the music they use  the Nike commercial  has for those  about to rock  I mean  that's just  that's awesome  that's great  you know  bands got over  that whole thing  when music was starting  to be used in commercials  there was a huge outrage  like how can you do that  blah blah blah  now  these bands  are looking at that  as another way  to market their stuff  sure  it's so motivating though  to listen to those  commercials are awesome 
[01:00:30]  they're motivating  yeah what's so bad  about a band's music  being used in a commercial  like who cares  it used to be bad  no I know  I remember  selling out man  of course  alright Michelle  thank you  best interview  one man Star Wars guy  your mom's box  from Whack Bag  saying that one  one man Star Wars  and then some of the  interviews with the  Ramon calls  can't be beat  of course  it's an interesting  argument  well Steve from  Yellowstone didn't exist  when Ozzy was in  no  too bad  he wouldn't have 
[01:01:00]  shown up either  he might have  he would have been  very nice  respectful  the only time you  ever would have  heard Steve from  Yellowstone being  fucking Pete Polite  Ramon put this man  in the rock and roll  hall of fame  Ramon  that could actually  be really funny  this would have all  been complimentary  yes  Ozzy rules  you're gonna have to  do the unexpected  with Ramon one day  that could be really  funny  and then just when  you think I'm being  nice I'll slam him  of course  I'll believe me  I'm looking forward  to the next one  my throat's ready  hey  go on another  ATV ride 
[01:01:30]  I have very good news  I have very good news  maybe not that far  I have very good news  for everybody  yes  remember yesterday  we couldn't talk  about the Grammys  because  Earl  somebody  let's just say  somebody  changed our channel  in the office  and that all  Earl was throwing  his own feces  around the office  and got in the VCR  and that's all it takes  to mess up  our whole system  of recording stuff  I don't know why  that would do it  but it does  I don't know  that technical  jargon  that technical talk 
[01:02:00]  so very good news  we did scrape up  some Grammy audio  extremely good news  for us  and our listeners  and by the way  before you do the Grammy  I want to say  that we talk about  music and new music  I found a guy  on the net  I don't know who he is  I have some stuff  I want to bring in  probably next week  but he's really good  and somebody might be able  to help me out  and know who he is  because this guy  is amazing  and I don't know his name  and it's frustrating me  is he a new guy  I don't know  what's his song  I don't remember  the name of it 
[01:02:30]  I swear to god  I'll play it for you  you'll love it  I just don't remember  the name  wait wait wait  what does it sound like  it's kind of like  easy listening  believe it or not  did you see him  on Saturday Night Live  no no no  I never saw him on TV  I don't know what  he looks like  or anything  Michael BublÃ©  no  maybe  I don't know  who was the guy  that was on SNL  I gotta get tickets  for my sister  to see Michael BublÃ©  when Dane Cook  Dane Cook was hosting  he was a musical guest  when Dane was hosting 
[01:03:00]  that was really good  guy's got a real  unique voice  believe me  it ain't for everybody  and it certainly isn't  for somebody  that likes rock  and stuff  but the guy  has a very unique voice  is it old school sounding  no  it's just something  out there  Ben might know it  he's kind of a music guy  but  god  you should be able  to pull it up  Dane Cook  hosted SNL  and he was the musical guest  we're on that page  and he was a very good writer  like his songs 
[01:03:30]  told like stories  and stuff  James Blunt  yeah James Blunt  is the guy's name  and  you sure it wasn't  Michael BublÃ©  no it wasn't  Michael BublÃ©  I don't even know  if that's his name  James Blunt  it's just like  can you give me tickets  to see Michael BublÃ©  so I asked Earl  and now I'm fucked  because Earl's not  going to do anything  usually I just switch  off of the musical guest  and this guy  it wasn't like  I liked the music  because it's not  my type of music  but it was one of those  like you couldn't  kind of tune away  and he's all 
[01:04:00]  like fucking piss eyed  he's wall eyed  whatever they want  to call it  so he looked all weird  and his voice  was really dynamic  kind of odd  did it make you cry  yeah I wept  like broke back  did he get all sentimental  yeah  when life was good  yeah  beautiful dawn  the guy's got like  ugh  the guy's got like  a really good voice 
[01:04:30]  he sounds like  half a chick  yeah he does  like Sharon Steve Perry  oh yeah  that's a bluff  this is a huge hit  actually  yeah  yeah  this guy's good  what am I still saying  I'm okay  I'm a fucking  faggot  he was good in Rush  it's not  does it give you 
[01:05:00]  goosebumps  when you're driving  when you're driving  home  do you crank it  did you pretend  you were on a stool  singing this  with your guitar  gee you must have  been looking  through the window  Jimmy  or that some other  guy was pushing  your stool in  while you listened  to it  it's faggot music  what do you want  from me  that sums up  your happiness  I said  what happens  when you hear  this song  give us a  deuce chill  do you  just feel good  do you sing along  do you crank it up 
[01:05:30]  a little bit  at this point  no you know  what it was  I appreciated  the uniqueness  of this  that it isn't  just a  my girlfriend  told me to  take a trip  with her to  like every other  fucking band  it just  it was a unique  sound  a little too  mellow for me  but I  appreciate it  don't try to cool  it up  it's not hard  enough for me  dude  I appreciate  the guy's voice  and originality  and styling  why don't you  put on friends  and lovers  and wear a dress 
[01:06:00]  I did  yesterday  you saw it  you were there  with me  alright I'll give  you my song  that kind of  gets me going  alright  this is the song  that gets me going  it's obvious  it gets you going  who are you kidding  you roll up the windows  make sure no one  sees you  listening to the  faggoty music  and he pretends  he's an American Idol  and that Simon likes him  his stupid daydream fan  faggot  alright now  who hasn't done that  you're actually  very good  who hasn't done that 
[01:06:30]  probably the number one  song on the CD  you're making  oh my god  you open up  a fraction  of a fraction  of an inch  on this show  and they peel you  like that face  in poltergeist  you motherfuckers  I'm gonna share too  I got one of those  douchey songs  that I enjoy  which one  changes your life  every time you hear it  when I'm in the gym  it just makes me  work out  just a little harder 
[01:07:00]  when I hear this song  you guys are assholes  man  I just feel an energy  that comes within  hey you see  your daydream fantasy  and like that  that's who you are  not that you wanna bang him  but like you actually  listen to that song  he will pretend  that he's on the  SNL stage  just in a fucking stool  kinda playing the guitar  let me tell you something  that right there  is the second time  I heard the guy  right  was the time  was when  Than just pushed the button  and it played  the first time 
[01:07:30]  was SNL  you know what I love about you  and that was it  you did finally share  a little bit  and that's why we jump on you  because you rarely share  on that level  and then you realize  it's not going good  and then you try to like  defend yourself  in ridiculous ways  I guarantee you  fucking downloaded that song  and every night  at your computer  you have to hear  you have to hear it  once a day  I will swear to you  I didn't  and I have not heard him  since SNL  and uh  until it was just played  he probably looked up  the lyrics online  because it was  why he couldn't guess 
[01:08:00]  what does this mean  you know  no  wow I think they're  talking about me  yeah this is like  my life  no  sorry  it's alright  it's alright  it's alright to be  faggoty  everyone's so hard  there's little shades  on the stool  please welcome  and they call me  when it gets to the hook  that was fantastic  when it gets to the hook  do you crank it up  and sing along  uh yeah  I do that  alright I'll share 
[01:08:30]  oh my god  actually it's uh  I got turned on to this band  because of the movie  Garden State  I love the Garden State  soundtrack  am I getting  just pounded  and actually my band  is uh  it's kind of in the same  genre  yeah I think  well I don't know  I think there's more  to this band  than uh  than good old  James Blunt  Pat from Unaki  John Belushi  would have taken  this guy's guitar  and smashed it  into the wall  that is very funny 
[01:09:00]  you bastards  I'm gonna get you  off the hook here  so uh  here it is  uh  Snow Patrol  is my band  done nothing  love the Snow Patrol  Travis give me a thumbs up  on the Snow Patrol  that should make you  smash their CDs  Travis  just kiss a little more  ass  before you even hear it  I like Genesee  that's where I went  to school too  yeah  Travis doesn't kiss ass  me and him  have had a thing  going the last  couple days  oh let's tell  the other day  I'm getting coffee  and he just looks at me 
[01:09:30]  he goes  you look really tired  today  I go  fuck you  and that's all I said  broke back  Starbucks machine  that's not a thing  going  that's groveling  Travis trying to relate  to the boss a little  uh  wait which song  is this  how are you doing today  this isn't the one  I like though  this is from Garden State  right  no this is your  broke back  it sounds kind of like  Snow Patrol  starting up  hey Opie  how's your coffee  you look tired  today boss  you look tired  I just look 
[01:10:00]  neck rub  I looked at him  with this evil look  and just said  fuck you  and that was it  leave me alone  and he replayed that  80 times in his head  that's not what  I should have said  to him  I should have said  you look awake  anyway  here's uh  here's the song  that gets uh  gets me going  with the douche chills  alright  let's hear  it's Snow Patrol  and it's a song  called Chocolate  Chocolate  Chocolate  the title alone  a little more upbeat 
[01:10:30]  a little more  it's on my uh  actually it's not  on my iPod  it's on my  MiFi  downloaded it  off of Ethel  can't really download it  but I recorded Ethel  and uh  I captured this song  and many others  that I like  this could be the very minute  I'm aware 
[01:11:00]  I'm alive  all these places  feel like home  with a name  I've never chosen  I can make my first step  generic crap  yeah it's not awful  it's just  it's the same shit  you hear all the fucking time  not like that other guy  wait for the hook man  okay  wait for the words 
[01:11:30]  as Jim Norton would say  waiting for the hook  to pull him off stage  vaudeville style  my friend  this is every song  not at all  I love this song  from a few Molly Ringwald movies  it doesn't sound like that  this is like the montage  like when she's looking at the guy  that she won't date  and he's looking back at her  this is what they play  or this is that 
[01:12:00]  you've just left the situation  you're driving  and it's the front shot  and you're thinking  hmm  should I  or shouldn't I  insert situation  situation  yeah  that's exactly what it is  and then  fade over to the girl  and she's in bed  thinking  and now you're driving again  thinking  when you pass the gym  and there's a blonde homo  working out a little harder  give me one more 
[01:12:30]  I wish I could name  the 30 bands  by the way  I'm playing this song today  because I'm on a power trip  yeah  fucking idiots  that don't get radio  you notice his song  played longer than Anthony's

[01:19:00]  on the view  this is what we get  to play  thought he was  putting the Grammys  in his ass  this is what we get  to play by the way  this is all we have  yes  Mario Cantones  we're a  powerful talk show  heard in two countries  here's your  Grammy audio  we had hours of audio  from the Grammys  that we could have had  right  but this is all  we could salvage  I bet he does voices  I bet there'll be  a Joan Crawford voice  a Liza Minnelli voice  and perhaps 
[01:19:30]  a Betty Davis  and a Judy Garland  I don't like this song  I mean I like this song too  Cartman  right  so here we go  Mario Cantone's  taking the Grammys  he did this on the view  yesterday or the day  before or whatever  it was  probably yesterday  I guess it would  have to be  the music industry's  biggest night last night  the 48th Grammy Award  show  and now for the 48th  Grammy Award dish  please welcome  the fabulous  Mario Cantone 
[01:20:00]  fabulous  fabulous means game  Ben we really need to  book Mario  we gotta get him on this show  he's terrific  he's outrageous 
[01:20:30]  he's wonderful  I'm Voss  here's  here's more  Grammy audio  alright let's get right  to the pre-show  let's start with that  Ryan Secret  Ryan Secret did a very good job  curious  asking Randy Jackson's wife  a very intimate question  I mean he's so smooth  and charismatic  is he a great lover  yes  good thing she wasn't  hooked up to a polygraph  there was a little 
[01:21:00]  hesitation there  and then we have  Evander Holyfield  this interview  was riveting  back with Evander Holyfield  right now  from Dancing with the Stars  last season  that was a good move  that show was a huge hit  yeah it was great  did you have some fun  now what are you doing  after you gonna go  party a little bit  a little bit  where are you going  I don't know yet  fascinating  kids  drugs are bad  and boxing is worse  he's not a druggie 
[01:21:30]  no I said he's a boxer  alright  first of all  he's a golfer  and second of all  cocks are no better  hey it's Ross  well that was awful  wow  Ryan Secret should be  fucking shot  he's got like  five jobs though  oh what a  just a non-entity  what a fucking  hole in the donut  personality wise  there's a little  Mario Cantone  personal moment  oh  oh  oh 
[01:22:00]  oh  oh  oh  motherfucker  oh yeah  alright  here's one more clip  how about the performances  the opening number  with Madonna  and the gorillas  and they animated  the gorillas  everything's like animated  it was very strange  it was a cartoon  hey I'll tell you something  talk about digitally enhanced  that's what the gorillas do  oh  whoa  he looks like a Hummel figurine 
[01:22:30]  with Snoopy stuffed in his pants  gosh  and then one of the characters  is so bored  he's texting somebody  he's texting his manager  okay I need some booze  and a hooker  in my hotel room afterwards  it's Ross  hey it's Ross  hey it's Ross  hey it's Ross  one more  promise 
[01:23:00]  alright  alright anyway  who else  anybody else  okay Kanye West  and Jamie Foxx  performed  their hit  Gold Digger  with the marching band  I bet nobody ever  called these guys  band queers  what  you know  when I was in junior high school  and I played the clarinet  I got the crack beat  out of me  because it was attached  to balls  I made that worthwhile  so there you go 
[01:23:30]  that's our Grammy audio  thank god  that's what we give  the people today  thank you Earl  what's the name of that  stupid song by  Jamie and Kanye  I'm a what  Gold Digger  I am really  really tired  of the Jamie Foxx thing  one year or so  on top  and right from the start  I just couldn't take it  because he stunk so bad  as a comic  and as a  I hated anything he did  but he was  Ray Charles  and then he does 
[01:24:00]  a good Ray Charles imitation  he does a Ray Charles imitation  and wins an Oscar  because he was believable as Ray  he did an imitation  no he was good  he was good  sorry  I have to agree  he was good  he was good  so let's see  anybody who does imitation  Frank Gorshin  should have won  an Academy Award  you're simplifying it  no I'm not  well he caught a lot of emotion  he did an imitation  he was very believable  as Ray Charles  that's not easy to pull off 
[01:24:30]  you know Val Kilmer  did more  everyone does a Ray Charles impression  and he stayed in character  my friend  he walked around blind  to feel what it's like  to be blind  that's right  oh why couldn't he have  walked in front of a truck  no  let's see you do that  Michael  yeah  let's see you  and then now he's  you know  he's a comic  he's an actor  he's fucking  music now  he does everything  but it wasn't music now  the renaissance man  that guy was known 
[01:25:00]  for his singing  he almost made it  a few times as a singer  oh really  I swear to god  yeah  who knew this  he does the impersonation  so good  when he was doing  hi  hi  I rock your world  hi  oh yeah  back then  I'm telling you  he came close  a couple times  he actually put out  an album I believe  a few years back  yeah why didn't it hit  because he wasn't doing  a Ray Charles impression  Eddie Murphy's overshadowed it  that was a damn good song  party all the time  I fucking challenge you  to find a better song  my girl wants to  you're trying to say 
[01:25:30]  he's a hack though  you don't give him his props  he might be  comedy wise  the guy stinks on ice  he might be  he might be overexposed  to this point  and you're sick of that  but the guy had  you know  the guy did it  yeah he did  he got an Oscar  for doing an impression  and then he put out  a shitty fucking  fighter movie  a shitty fucking  airplane movie  well everyone  everyone in Hollywood  ends up having a bomb  here and there  right after the Oscar one  you guys ever see  Iron Eagle  that's a good movie  climb high  play the tape  I'm back 
[01:26:00]  talk about one good  fucking movie  I used to love  Lou Gossett  and I realized  after an officer  and a gentleman  he stunk  you know  I think that movie  had more meaning to it  than just an alien  and an earthling  enemy mind  yeah  enemy mind  I think that might have  been a cultural thing  really  like an analogy  for blacks and whites  here on earth  excuse me  I didn't catch it  I'm silly like that  Ron Jeremy had  941 movie credits  thank you for that  Jesus 
[01:26:30]  tent in California  let's say hi to Seth  in Jersey  Seth  hey  Opie I wanted to let you know  you can get Michael BublÃ©  at Hallmark  with your gift  with the card purchase  of three or more  are you kidding  no I'm not  he's one of those artists  you got it  Michael BublÃ©  BublÃ©  BublÃ©  BublÃ©  BublÃ©  thought I'd let you know  punching out  I think my sister  had different parents  I'm almost convinced of it  yeah she's into  Michael BublÃ©  she's just  way too nice  to be in our family  isn't it embarrassing  when you gotta do things  for your family like that 
[01:27:00]  nah she never asks  cause I know you had to do  a Ricky Martin thing  once  back in the day  and then I decide  I got a bunch of  Aerosmith tickets  tickets once  for Jones Beach  and my mother actually  likes Aerosmith  as does my sister  and stuff  so I decided to take them  along with me  and they brought Sal  now Sal knows nothing  about music past 1950  you know  like 1959  anytime you go over  he's got XM  channel 50 
[01:27:30]  he's got the 50's channel on  all the time  that's all he listens to now  this XM is great Anthony  I love the 50's  it's amazing  and that's all you hear  all right enough  so we go to Aerosmith  we get there  Aerosmith starts  and you know  they're just  blasting loud  front thing  we find out later  Sal thought  he was going to see  Air Supply  right until he sat down  and Aerosmith 
[01:28:00]  just starts cranking out  he thought  Air Supply  was going to come on  and sing whatever  the hell they sing  what the hell's going on here  yeah  Ro  is it good  Ro  this is an Air Supply  that's funny  my mom can't get enough  of Rod Stewart  singing the classics  oh no  every time  every time  another volume  of that horse shit  comes out  she's first online  to get it  can I tell you  that we're having a party  his version of that  it's so fucking bad 
[01:28:30]  it makes me angry  it's such a bad song  the original stinks  and his version  is fucking terrible  Todd the Trucker  morning boys  hey  Opie  I gotta hand it to you man  I used to be all about  the classic rock  but you've turned me on  to a lot of great music  everybody can give you  a hard time  about the music  you listen to  and what not  but you turned me on  to the whole  Squiz thing  and now  I'm just discovering  a whole bunch  of new music  like Crazy Bitch  by Buck Cherry  there's all kinds 
[01:29:00]  of great stuff  out there  I gotta tell you  XM has done  a much better job  with the music channels  when we first came  to XM  what 16 months ago  I was like  ugh  musically  they were like  being way too cool  for the room  way too cool  for the room  but they got  this John Zellner guy  in and he's really  taking care of  all the channels  and now  you can listen to them  a lot longer  Ethel and Squiz  are my favorites  Lucy's right up there  and  even like  Top Tracks 
[01:29:30]  they'll play some stuff  even radio  regular radio  didn't play  all those years  yeah Top Tracks  is good if you like  classic rock  but not like  your standard  classic rock  Deep Tracks  is still  completely ridiculous  they have to have  10 listeners  at any given moment  but they're into  those Deep Tracks  oh my god  what'll they play  like something  they find  ridiculous  they find  throwaway music  that's  even the artists  don't want this  stuff played  the shit they had  to put on  as filler  on the album  I think Lee Abrams 
[01:30:00]  is going into  like Jethro Tull's  attic  at night  and finding shit  he's doing like  some kind of  Tom Cruise  Mission Impossible  thing to get  this stuff  from the artists  that's what you want  a 20 minute  flute solo  flute solo  from Ian Anderson  he discovers  the one song  where Ian Anderson  decided to play  spoons  as an experiment  Deep Tracks  he did that  as a goof  we don't need  to play it  oh Deep Tracks  oh my god  oh my god  yeah 
[01:30:30]  holy  holy crap  I'm a fan  of the Ethel  and the Decades  like the Decades  Channel  70s Channel  they're fun  uh oh  we have more  Michael BublÃ©  Michael BublÃ©  Mike in Florida  how's it going guys  hey  I had to give a  Michael BublÃ©  CD  to my future in-laws  that's not his name  you're not saying it right  if you're going to talk  about Michael BublÃ©  you gotta talk  yeah you gotta say it right  Michael BublÃ©  forgive me  I had to give him  Michael BublÃ© 
[01:31:00]  CD to my future in-laws  for Christmas  and we had to play it  on Christmas Eve  it was so fucking bad  I wanted to impale my head  on the fucking Christmas tree  it is awful  awful  he's blowing up though  I hope he does blow up  alright  he's fucking terrible  Michael BublÃ©  exploded today  Bill in Philly  hey  I just wanted to know  if you can put  Snow Patrol back on  and not finish my fantasy  about my fight  with my wife  this morning  that's one of those bands 
[01:31:30]  that brings you back  to when the relationship  was good  you know what I'm saying  if you can't get that  just put on  I'll stop the world  and melt with you  and listen to that  another montage song  you know I once saw that  my brother tells a great story  I think it's  it's another band  that had one hit  Modern English  but I saw Modern English  and they didn't have  enough of a catalog  that they played  that song three times  in their set  yeah a couple of people  do that  they start the show 
[01:32:00]  with it  I heard Aha does that  with Take On Me  they do it in the middle  of the set  this goes back  many many years  and then that's the encore  but they jazz it up  and make it a sing along  and the whole crowd  and the whole crowd  goes stop the world  I love when the band  does that  what is he going to do  what is he going to do  how is he going to get  the fire out  I didn't even notice that  oh god 
[01:32:30]  oh boy  you know I hate that  because I'm watching  I'm laughing  and then they go back  to the show  that show in the trailer  and I forget that  we were just watching  the trailer  and I hope it was  the whole movie  there is a fire  I will put it out  with this seltzer bottle  I will spray my dignity  on it  alright we gotta take a break  he's gotta turn backwards  and he sprays himself  in the face  but then he's shocked  and he's shaking  like he thinks  oh sight gag  after sight gag  the Pink Panther

[01:35:00]  in New York  uh oh  and in the restaurant business  that is really really bad  is that something you're learning  I'm learning so much  about the restaurant business  why is that bad  me and my two brothers  have this restaurant  in Huntington  FH Riley's  400 New York Avenue  it's pretty much  in downtown Huntington  it's becoming a great hang  with the O&A pest and stuff  Ben will tell you  you learn a lot of things  you make all your money  on the weekends basically  and you hope you do well  during the week  yeah  just kind of break even  during the week  and when you have  a huge snowstorm 
[01:35:30]  where people aren't  going to go out  on a weekend  and you lose a Saturday night  that's not good  for the restaurant business  right Ben  sure  Ben doesn't want  to talk about restaurants  I don't necessarily  agree with you  on the snowstorm thing  that's when you gotta  cook the books  no matter if it's  in our neighborhood  but it's not a city  restaurant where people  can still get around  they gotta drive  we're a little nervous  I'm not gonna lie to you  but there's a bunch of us  that will be hanging out  at FH Riley's tonight  all night long  I'm going there for dinner  and then hanging  and buying drinks  buying drinks for people  at the bar  you know Huntington though dude  Huntington is 
[01:36:00]  we'll see  they're all drunk  is it a storm tonight  like you brought one out  a snowstorm  I love drinking  your brother  tomorrow night I think  tomorrow night  we should call the snow patrol  will your brother Darren be there  Darren be there  yeah  yeah  Darren just  you know  you gotta go to  the place  because it's becoming  it has a personality  in it  I got my brother-in-law  behind the bar  my brother Darren  scopes out all the hot chicks  and gets them at one table  and hangs out with them  my other brother's  gonna be guest bartending  my sister's making 
[01:36:30]  the freaking cheesecakes  it's so ridiculous  keep it in the family  that's what we're doing  but we're having a lot of fun there  it's becoming a pretty cool hangout  with the Opie and Anthony listeners  on Long Island  so trudge through the snow this weekend  well no  tonight's gonna be a fine night  we're fine as far as a storm  so we're all going down there  it should be a good hang tonight  I'll be there  and I do buy drinks  when you're at the bar  not for everybody  but I throw out  white people  just saying  that's right  it's okay  you're among friends  you make others that come in 
[01:37:00]  that aren't as white  feel unwelcome  so they don't return  and we have a designated  bar stool for the past  I think  they're gonna have their name on  and everything  so  it's FH Riley's  in Huntington  I know it's a cheap plug  but we'll be hanging out there  tonight  having dinner and drinks  and stuff  okay  you actually believing  this snowstorm thing  yeah  I think  I think we're finally fucked  we've had it way too easy  very easy  but I just  the weathermen  fuck up so much  and hype stuff so much  that I'm thinking  it's gonna be a bust 
[01:37:30]  not a bust  we'll get something  yeah  three inches  something easily plowed  and then done  yeah  and they'll  well it took a heading  we did  the storm tracker  8000  told us it was gonna go this way  but it went a little east or west  that happens every time  are you saying  it's gonna be a dusting  it could be a dusting  I think a little more  than a dusting  Kenny in Jersey  what's up  hey you guys  missed Jimmy's line there  he just stepped down  during that thing  he said  he said there's gonna be  a snowstorm this weekend  and he said yeah  you better call the snow patrol

[01:38:30]  capture shots  and everything  screen caps  yes  and everything  yeah we verified who it is  and  and  what  is he in trouble  I came in  grabbed a magazine  from the couch  which  I mean  we don't really have  it's all porn  it's all pornography  so was it that tall  red headed boy  going to jack off  no  that intern  no it wasn't an intern  and  the other thing  uh oh  yeah  I want the listeners  to call in  if they felt there was  a really good line 
[01:39:00]  that somebody didn't  get credit for  or a very bad one  that everyone missed  oh yeah  that's good too  because  the fact is  we really don't listen  too well to each other  we need to be disciplined  so why don't we have  people call in  and call us out on it  good idea Jimmy  wow  fat trucker  hey what's up  that was a very good line  I got it  I laughed my ass off  thank you  anyway  the restaurant  does it have  FH Radice  does it have food to go  food to go  we started lunches  we got live music tonight

[01:40:30]  your nor'easter  that they're predicting  for Saturday  we're getting it here  in Colorado right now  and it's a fucking bust  it started snowing  at 11 last night  Eric  because you can tell  over Colorado  what it's going to be  when it gets here  Eric you're a dummy  our snowstorm's  coming from Florida  it's the same storm  I was watching the weather  this morning  it's going south  sir sir  let me explain  something to you  do you understand  that there can be  a massive cold front  that blows over Colorado  with no way  for any moisture  to get there  so it just  you get a dusting 
[01:41:00]  and cold  and then when it comes  on the east coast  when it comes over  the east coast  and the gulf stream  brings moisture  from the south  and cold air  from the north  and they connect  we get huge snowstorms  I'm not saying  that's going to happen  this time  but that's what happens  you can have the cold  but a complete lack  of moisture  we get tropical moisture  and the cold  meeting up  and that's why  we can get some real  humdingers  how do you know that  you're not going to get  actually I think  that was from 
[01:41:30]  the weather channel  forget Aristotle  and fuck Socrates  here comes  Professor Anthony  that's why Anthony  doesn't listen  to the weather  on the news  he figures it out  himself  I have maps  my god  the internet charts  you know my idea  of a weather report  is well it's not  snowing as much  alright well  just try to be prepared  right  Anthony's got his  charts out and stuff  you got your own  five day forecast  hung up in your  house  you have to look  at the frontal  boundaries  and where they 
[01:42:00]  converge  of course you do  that's what makes  everyone knows that  the system  if you have a  clockwise rotation  of high pressure  sitting at a  northwest  of us  it will  in that clockwise  direction  bring cold air  down  from Canada  now you get  a low pressure  system  maybe off the  coast  and that  counterclockwise  rotation  brings the moisture 
[01:42:30]  on to us  these converge  oh it could be  a doozy  I'll tell you  at 11  let's go to break  Bill Burr is here  in honor of  Anthony's little  bar gig there  we got the  we got the  masters of  of this game  I love this  it's the tube  bar tape  red  as we go to  break  Bill Burr in 
[01:43:00]  studio today  what's going on  and a schizo  comic from  Cleveland  outside the  studio  his name's  Bill  and he's  just staring  at us  with his  tie  he's waiting  for a  confession  he's the  real deal  he's the  bad cop  I don't know  where Master Poe  was today  because I  walked up  the elevator  whatever brought  me upstairs  and there  was that guy  I'm like  holy shit  what's this  about  I don't know  maybe an intern  or something  at that point  apparently

[01:45:30]  girlfriend catches  him in his  uniform on the  computer  dressed as  standing there  in my SS  uniform  in the middle  of the empty  living room  just in the  hallway at night  with some  moonlight on him  and she goes  what's wrong  and you just  go please  help me  but you're  looking beyond  her and you're  wearing a full  Nazi regalia  that's my  favorite thing  you've ever  done  people have  this misconception  that I have  accepted some  Nazi ideology 
[01:46:00]  I am a  fan of  memorabilia  and World  War II  collectibles  which means  I  he sounds like  Pete Townsend  I was just  doing research  I was doing  research  I have  I think  what they did  was atrocious  it was  truly an  atrocity  on man  and the  planet  losing  no not  losing  fan  they  should have  worked  harder  but I 
[01:46:30]  appreciate  the  memorabilia  not memorabilia  that's like  you're  glorifying it  I like  the collectibles  that came out  of it  and I don't  own one  Nazi flag  I don't own  one swastik  in my house  I think you  overpaid  I gotta tell you  oh you saw  what I paid  at the auction  newsday.com  gun hitler  may have  owned  fetches  $140,000  may have  may have  did you 
[01:47:00]  would you  put it up  on ebay  like that  yeah  may have  owned this  yeah  here's some  slippers  or maybe not  he might have  slipped his feet  into  $140,000  for a  rifle  with the  engraving  AH  H on it  could be  anything  could be  alright  so they had  taken it  as a souvenir  when it was  seized  yeah  that'll make  see  that's a  collectible  I'm sure  the guy  that bought  that  isn't some  fanatic 
[01:47:30]  looking to  spread  Nazi  not at all  at what point  did you stop  bidding  about 80 grand  by 80 I was like  ah they're not  even sure it's  his  take my bid  down  I'm gonna go  for the  Goebbels  rookie card  Adolf Hitler's  gun people  Adolf Hitler's  gun  we don't know  how many  Jews this  might have  killed  people  be dialing  put it on  the flex pay  Anthony in  New York  what's up  hey  guys  great show 
[01:48:00]  been listening  since any  W  thank you  I just had  a couple  of funny  thoughts  while waiting  online  can you imagine  if Oprah  asked you guys  on the show  she'd be like  your mom  interviewing you  like why  are you looking  at those  naked women  hold on let me  just digest that  funny thought  alright can we  all just let it  sink in for a  moment  no no let it  sink  let it sink  a couple funny  thoughts  we're enjoying  this one  time for the  next one  alright  let's hear it  quick question  since I'm a new  listener would it  be possible for 
[01:48:30]  you guys  no  on XM  to interview  Jackie  Martin  did he come  on your  shelf  wait a minute  you did say  you were  listening since  NEW and then  you just said  that you're  a new listener  it's on XM  meaning  off and on  I was working  at the time  did you just  get XM  or something  I got it  on direct TV  how long ago  only a couple  months ago  then right  yeah I would  say you guys  came on what  November  we've been in  contact with  good old  Jackie  yeah  good old  Jackie  but I think  he wants a  little more  than like  one day  maybe would

[01:53:30]  yeah  and then his  girlfriend  his beard  came over  with a frying  pan  tried to hit  the Kodiak  over the head  Kodiak  wasn't having  it  and instead  of getting  the cheeseburger  he went  for the  quarter pounder  he ate  grizzly man  and his  girlfriend  he supersized  and he was  a guy  that wanted  to be famous  in Hollywood  he was up  for the part  and cheers  that Woody  Harrelson  ended up  getting  supposedly  dude  every failed  actor  if they  fail  they somehow  came this  close  this close  so close

[01:54:30]  bear  holy crap  and I'm gonna  tell you  that doesn't  even do it  you have to  rent this  movie  because  this fucking  bear  is 10 feet  tall  rubbing  its back  against  this tree  that if you  drove into  it in your  fucking  hummer  you would  go through  the windshield  and die  and this tree  is like  bending over  like get this  fucking thing  off me  and this gag  dude is like  two feet away  going  he's a big  bear  yes he is  he's a big  bear  and these  fucking bears 
[01:55:00]  are just  they're like  weirded out  by the guy  it's like  they're kind of  full of salmon  so they don't  attack him  but they just  kind of  every once in a  while they  kind of  snap at him  and he treats  him like a dog  they get  creeped out  by him  you can tell  wow  on some level  you can tell  the bears  are creeped out  by this guy  this guy  should not  be here  does he know  we can just  kill him  instantly  yeah and  what is that  yeah what is it  Tony in Cleveland  Tony  wow  hey how's it going  guys  hey  hey uh  on my  myspace  and a couple  months ago 
[01:55:30]  I sent some  pictures of  Steve  there were  pictures of  the grizzly  guys attack  on Ogre  for about  two weeks  after it was  announced  and then they  had to pull  him  oh so they  are out there  somewhere  I don't even  want to see  the movie  because they  yanked that  audio of him  being killed  it's like  that's the  fucking  highlight of  the movie  yeah they  had the  audio and  they refused  to play it  a documentary  it's a  documentary  they should  have played  that  I didn't  want to  see it  but they  were going  for a  mass  audience  yeah I've  got it on  my myspace  if you look  it's got a  picture of a  cop standing  next to just  his leg  with like all  the meat  gone and just  bone laying 
[01:56:00]  there  is that  really the  pictures from  this  yeah they  were on there  for about a  week or two  and then for  some reason  they jerked  them off  because the  whole family  I guess  was having  a fit over  we're going  to put you  on hold  so we can  go to your  myspace  if it's  really good  we'll announce  it to the  world  okay  alright thanks  Tony hold  on a second  get his  myspace thing  it's myspace  slash Jim  Norton  I didn't want  to see the  movie because I  didn't want to  hear that audio  but after three  minutes of watching  this idiot  I wanted to see  him get killed  by a bear 
[01:56:30]  but they don't  play it  they don't  do it  it's even  worse  yeah because  the director  listens to it  and then just  goes you need  to burn this  like it was a  big moment  about himself  yeah you're  going to decide  for everybody  else thank you  don't exploit  this  yeah that I  have  yeah as we  exploit the guy  exactly  what a fucking  asshole  oh that pissed  me off  you're just  afraid it'll  be too graphic  to probably get  mass distribution  or something  like that  he fucks an  eight year old  no one else  should do this  we should burn  this child  people should not  have sex with  children  I saw that movie  early on 
[01:57:00]  and halfway  through it  I realized  oh my god  they're not  they're teasing  it but they're  never going to  play this audio  I was getting  so pissed off  in the theater  yeah that's why  I don't want  to see it  for what  because it's  in the documentary  category  you know what  I mean  can we have  the director  on the phone  I guess we can  why not  that'll happen  it's not a bad  idea  but they did  kind of sell it  like you were  going to hear  the audio  yeah exactly  you know he's  killed  you're like alright  this will be  kind of interesting  to watch  I remembered that  I remembered that  alright here we go  Grizzly man  talks about  the Grinch  the name of  one of his bears 
[01:57:30]  I guess  I want to  introduce you  to one of the  key role players  in this year's  expedition  the bear's name  is the Grinch  the Grinch  has come on  to be one of  the more frequent  bears here  in the Grizzly maze  the Grinch  is a female  of about five  years of age  oh hi Grinch  hi  and she has  kind of an  aggressive attitude  hi  if I turn around  too much  she'll bite me  it's okay  hi how are you  how are you  don't you do 
[01:58:00]  that  don't you do  that  back off  don't do it  it's okay  I love you  I love you  I love you  I love you  I love you  I'm sorry  wow  okay what  happened there 
[01:58:30]  was the thing  like he fucking  walks up to this  thing in the  I mean I'm  literally looking  at it like  they're gonna  show it  he's gonna  get killed  here  right here  you can't  believe actually  what you can  do to a bear  what it takes  for these  fucking things  to attack you  the bear is  looking at him  like dude  get the fuck  away from me  he's coming  hey  he's a big bear  and he finally  went  like this  10,000 per square  inch  lunge at this  guy and then  he starts scolding  him like he's a  fucking like a  chihuahua  yeah  no no  no 
[01:59:00]  I love you  you don't do that  and then the thing's  walking away and he's  going I love you  I love you  the bear's just like  you know  maybe the bears  were afraid to bite  him because of  what they might  catch  somewhere there's  a bear in a robe  right now  little honey tea  next to him  an 80 pound bear  going I just  wanted a snack  careless  hibernating in  July  curled up in the  fetal position  coughing and  frightened  his friends have  to bring him  honeycomb  all he wants 
[01:59:30]  is the fucking  Will and Grace  box set  other bears  protesting to get  him out of the  neighborhood  one understanding  deer  there is no  see I didn't  hear any of this  or see the movie  or anything  it's a comedy  you got it right  all I've seen  close to this  are real  nature documentaries  where there seems  to be a professional  person who knows  something about the 
[02:00:00]  animals teaching you  about them  even that stupid  Australian guy  even he like  kind of knows  something about  the animals  and how they  should and  shouldn't be  treated  this guy  from what I've  heard so far  has no business  being among  goldfish  never mind bears  he has no clue  it doesn't seem  like he's doing  anything that is  benefiting our  education of the  bear  you know what we 
[02:00:30]  what we learn  about bears  this guy just  decided he's  going out with  bears until one  of them eat  him  he just makes up  shit about  nature  at one point  he's laying next  to half a fox  some wolves or  something ripped  this fox apart  that used to be  one of his pets  that he'd name  yeah what was  his name  I don't know  what the hell  Foxy  yeah this is  Foxy  and he's laying  there I just  don't understand  why this has to  happen like it's  like there's too 
[02:01:00]  many guns in the  neighborhood  that's the way  he's treating  this shit  another senseless  killing  yeah I don't  understand and  then the idiot  who's making the  documentary hits  like pause and  he goes this is  where I have to  disagree I  believe wilderness  is chaos  it's like dude  you're rationalizing  with a crazy  person  right  that dude just  went like  and you were  like no I  actually think  any idiot  knows what  goes on out  there bigger  animals eat  the littler ones  yes that's how  it works he did  this year after  year after year  he got crazier  and crazier and  I'm convinced 
[02:01:30]  that he decided  all right I'm  gonna just commit  suicide by allowing  one of these  bears to eat  bear to eat  suicide by bear  and then there'll  be video and  I'll be legendary  as that voice in  his head got  louder and louder  suck a cock  I like pussy  that's a big  bear kill me  by the way  we got reports  the audio was  a little low  we got a brand  new copy so  might want to  turn down your  exam so you  don't get  that director  really should  be shot  you're right  that was probably  a personal  moment for him  that everyone  else had to  fucking suffer 
[02:02:00]  because of  I know  I hated that  what a douche bag  Beck in Florida  hey what's up  guys  hey if you can  recall during the  movie the guy  had a fetish  with the bear  shit  every time he  turned around  he was like  caressing and  holding it  it's just  one of these  movies that's not  supposed to be a  comedy that is  it's in my  comedy section  at my house  it's hilarious  it really is  funny on so  many levels  Caddyshack  Animal House  Grizzly Man 
[02:02:30]  he's got a  sandwich between  Caddyshack and  Schindler's List  I forgot about  that he does  start he gets  more and more  into playing with  the bear shit  that's just  great  that's fantastic  oh yeah  hey is there  something in there  for you Jim  he's got a  helpful rascal  with his  what kind of  haircut does he  have like the  prince  what is it  what is it  called  yeah he's got  that hairdo  going it's just  it's funny 
[02:03:00]  oh you know  the best part  you have the  audio with the  guy from LA  his ex actor  friend out there  who turns his  death into like  a monologue  he's like trying  to like book an  audition  you can tell  he fucking  rehearsed it  this thing is  like there's so  many different  layers this thing's  hilarious and if  I described it  better that would  have been funny  too well maybe  we can get the  active friend on  the phone we  should interview  um yeah that'll  happen why not  they're not that  big famous no one  cares about them  I don't know  someone's saying  the director's in  Munich Germany or  something like that  is it really 
[02:03:30]  well we have  audio they didn't  highlight it as one  of the best cuts  but it is though  the director listens  to the audio of the  attack then tells  jewel ex-girlfriend  uh to get rid of  the tape so we do  have that we'll get  to that in a second  but first here's  another clip this is a  helicopter pilot that  used to fly him in  and out would drop  him off and go  oh Jesus this guy's  nuts and then he'd  pick him up like two  three months later  that long he'd be  there yeah he was  there for like the  whole summer I think  right yeah he would  leave right before  they started to  hibernate but the  the year he got  eaten he decided to 
[02:04:00]  stay longer knowing  that uh more  dangerous bears were  taking the place of  the the bears that  were there that were  going to hibernate  I guess there's a  whole cycle like some  bears go hibernate  earlier and then these  really nasty ones that  could survive in  worst conditions still  hang around for  another month or so  and eat everything  it's like being in  midtown I guess and  then deciding one  night you're going to  go uptown how much  longer it's kind of  the same it seems the  same you would think  it would be the same  but somehow something's 
[02:04:30]  different it's like  walking around this  area at night gets a  little different than  walking around here  a little bit here we  go here's the  helicopter pilot I  think the only reason  that treadwell lasted  as long in the game  as he did was that  the bears probably  thought there was  something wrong with  him like he was  mentally retarded or  something  retarded  that bear I think  that day decided that 
[02:05:00]  he had either had  enough of Tim  treadwell or that  something clicked in  that bear's head that  he thought hey you  know he might be good  to eat I think that's  closer to my opinion I  think treadwell thought  these bears were big  scary-looking harmless  creatures that he could  go up and pet and sing  to and they would bond as  children of the universe or  some odd I think he had 
[02:05:30]  lost sight of what was  really going on  this guy's fucking  rationalizing it like the  bear had a like maybe  it was a political  argument maybe that's why  he killed him you  fucking idiot I'm Tim  treadwell that's with the  chopper he had a  falling out with the  bears the bears thought  he was retarded the  bears thought he was  retarded and said I've  had enough of this guy  or he thought that's a  tasty treat the bear I'll  go with the tasty treat I 
[02:06:00]  think the bear just looked  he was hungry and bears  will eat anything there's  stupid bears they have  video of the bear that  ate them they're convinced  that he actually taped  them yeah and you could  just see it they make  this point in the movie  you could just see it in  the bear's eyes that  there was just a I just  need to eat look hungry  bear he was an older  bear and the only younger  ones ate all the salmon  and this douchebag was  standing there he's a  big old bear can't hunt  anymore looking at the  footage and this Tim  guy is watching this bear  dive really deep and Tim 
[02:06:30]  thinks it's great that the  bear could dive that deep  and it's so cute and  stuff and the experts  like that's not cute  that's proven that this  bear is beyond hungry and  is going really deep down  to try to get food you  see the picture of the  bear sitting down by the  waterfall and he just  puts his hand in and a  salmon's on his claw and  he eats it puts another  one if bears got to work  for anything right yeah  they must be that's what  the expert is explains like  you know he has to work  real hard to survive at  this point it's not like  you know the height of the 
[02:07:00]  salmon season where you  just scoop up as many as  yeah and what's funny  when you look at the  footage of the bear it  literally looks like the  bear's playing it's a scene  right out of Bambi because  he's diving deep and then  coming back on his back and  if you knew nothing about  these animals like I don't I  was like laughing go ahead  look at him how cute he's  swimming swimming he's just  taking a break he's starving  he's doing the yeah he's  diving down deep because  there's no fucking fish left  and he keeps coming up and  he's occasionally glancing  over at this idiot I can eat 
[02:07:30]  that I think yeah just go  I could eat another step  closer it's like finding a  chick in the neighborhood  who sucks your dick  immediately the bear is  probably like I heard  about this asshole I can't  believe he's really here  this guy's for real I thought  this was a goof an urban  legend do you hear about the  guy that just hangs around  he doesn't run away when you  walk up to him no he just  talks to you it's a set up  man I don't like it who did  this Danny or you  the description on the next  track is hilarious hello bear  why don't you take a seat  right over there what were 
[02:08:00]  you thinking when you came  over to this guy's camp I  don't know track seven  listen to this spirit the  fox's cub ghost takes Tim's  hat and runs off what  results can only be described  as fag mad and could be the  most hilarious audio ever  recorded fag mad the hat ends  up in a den but Danny's saying  this could be the most  hilarious audio ever ever  recorded Anthony all right  ever hey who's stealing that 
[02:08:30]  hat let me see that hat ghost  I want that hat man ghost is  bad ghost what are you doing  with that hat ghost that hat is  a very important hat drop it  hey oh god damn it I can't  believe this ghost ghost where's  that fucking hat that hat is so  friggin valuable for this trip 
[02:09:00]  ghost you come back here with  that friggin hat if it's in the  den I'm gonna fucking explode  ghost where's that hat but it's  not okay for you to steal it  oh man oh man  it's a friggin den  he sounds like he's chasing a  toddler through his house he's in  the fucking wilderness right  ghost  that's my hat 
[02:09:30]  I want to say that I mean I mean  this I hate Tim Treadwell and I'm  glad he's dead  I'm glad he's fucking dead by the  way his girlfriend's name is ghost  too  yeah  damn it  that's kind of funny ring ring  all right here we go  oh wait the phone  here's the next track  Tim petting and talking to  Timmy the Fox  Timmy  and then he asked the public to  stop killing and hurting foxes 
[02:10:00]  do you know anyone that kills and  hurts foxes  I know nobody that does that  Bill you  no you know what I've never heard  of it  I've never you know  do do do do tally ho  we get up on horseback and send  the hounds out  chase that fox  go on a fox trot  fox hunt  how often do you  how often do you call your  friends I'll leave a message  we're out hurting a fox  call you back  it's a different perspective I do 
[02:10:30]  believe  how many foxes can be hurt out  there  only Timmy is the boss of all foxes and  all bears  you're the ruler  yay  look at that face and look at that ear  yay  thanks for being my friend  this is so good  does it feel good  we patrol the grizzly sanctuary together  how did we meet  over a decade ago  he left his mother and father's side 
[02:11:00]  promptly peed on my shoes  pooped on my clothes  that was it  he was my friend  Timmy the fox  yep  and we watch over things  and he's the boss  takes care of everything  yep  yep  yes I love my head  I think one of the things that's really important  is you can see the bond  that has developed between this very wild animal  and this very  fairly wild person  and you realize he has this gorgeous fur  and people are trying to kill him for it  with steel jaw traps 
[02:11:30]  and cruel farming practices  and other people run him down on horses for a sport  fox hunting  we want this to end  between Timmy the fox  this beautiful fox and me  we ask the public  please  stop killing  and hurting these foxes  and torturing them  don't you think  yeah  if they knew how beautiful he was  and how sweet he was  they would never hurt him  thanks king  holy shit  too bad  two bears didn't do an infomercial 
[02:12:00]  please stop eating  psychotic faggots  please just let them wander around your neighborhood  without being harmed and eaten  I like how they're playing that acoustic guitar music  like they're so trying to get you to give a fuck about this guy  he had a good heart  yeah  the rest of us  yeah we're all too jaded  I like this next track  because he loses his mind  because he's talking to the camera  and it's not coming out right  so he does the lines over and over again 
[02:12:30]  and he gets madder and madder  listen to this  Timothy used his camera as a tool  to get his message across  sometimes his approach was very playful  do another take here  I fucked up the last one  I almost just fell off the cliff  I'm a fucking asshole  behind me is the grizzly sanctuary  and also behind me hidden down below  in those trees  somewhere is my camp  I must stay incognito  I must hide from the authorities  I must hide from people who would harm me 
[02:13:00]  I must now even hide from people that seek me out  because I've made some sort of  I don't want to say celebrity  but they come here to Alaska  and they hear about Treadwell in the bush  and they want to go find him  but they can't  I'm hidden down below  no one knows where I am  even I don't even know where I am  that was pretty shitty  let's do a really short take here  but as a filmmaker he was methodical  whatever  often repeating takes 15 times  one more really short excellent take 
[02:13:30]  let's just really sum it up  here we go  this is going to be the motherfucker  behind me is the grizzly sanctuary  and also hidden down below is my camp  for I must now remain hidden  from the authorities  from people who would harm me  for I must now  from people who would seek me out as a story  my future  depends on it  I must be a spirit in the wilderness  he's methodical as a director  he's kind of like Kubrick  but without limbs  he's a shithead  Rachel  my camp 
[02:14:00]  is down there  someday  it will all be yours  the paloponies  my mutilated body  what is a string of intestines  Rachel  you've hit him over the head  with a frying pan  if there  I have no idea if there's a god  but if there's a god  god would be very very  pleased with me  if you just watch me here  how much I love them  how much I adore them 
[02:14:30]  how respectful I am to them  how I am one of them  and how the studies they give me  the photographs  the video  and take that around  for no charge  to people around the world  it's good work  I feel good about it  I feel good about myself doing it  and I want to continue  and I hope I can  I really hope I can  but if not  be warned  I will die for these animals  I will die for these animals  I will die for these animals 
[02:15:00]  thank you so much  for letting me do this  thank you so much  for these animals  for giving me a life  I had no life  now I have a life  thank you so much  for getting killed  that faggot eating bear  does not get that picture  foraging lessons  salmon eating lessons  I was going to make him  a producer  of foundry music  Danny didn't highlight 
[02:15:30]  this track  but I think we should play  because it says  this is the cut  where Tim wonders  why girls don't want  to be with him  let's see what he has  to say about this  because you're gay  and you smell like bear shit  and that's my story here  for me  Timothy Treadwell  the kind warrior  can I take it  I'm trying  okay yeah  I can do it 
[02:16:00]  yeah why not  why not  across the halfway point  government's given me  all they have  so far  I've stood up to it  I've had danger  in the boat  almost died  I've almost fallen  off the cliff  yeah  the danger factor  is about to amp up  in the maze  the maze is always  the most dangerous  lord I do not  want to be hurt  by a bear  I do not  I always cannot  understand why girls 
[02:16:30]  don't want to be  with me for a long time  because I have really  a nice personality  I'm fun  I'm very very good  in the  well you're not  supposed to say that  when you're a guy  but I know I am  they know I am  and  I don't fight  with them  I'm so passive  a bit of a patsy  which is that  a turn off to girls  to be a patsy  I mean it's not  it's not that I'm  a total great guy  that means you're maggot 
[02:17:00]  I'm a lot of fun  and have a good life  going  I don't know  what's going on  I always wished  I was gay  it would have been  a lot easier  you know  you can just  bing bing bing  gay guys  no problem  I mean they go  to restrooms  and truck stops  and they perform  sex  it's like so easy  for them  and stuff  but you know what  alas  Timmy Turner  is not gay  bummer  I love girls  girls  girls need a lot  more  need a lot more 
[02:17:30]  hold on I gotta  back up a little  yeah  yeah  that guy  is trying a little  too hard  hold on let's back up  here a little bit  no problem  no problem  I mean they go to  restrooms  and truck stops  and they perform  sex  it's like so easy  for them  and stuff  but you know what  alas  Timmy Turner  is not gay  bummer  I love girls  you lied  you're a fucking liar  I need a lot more  I need a lot more  you know 
[02:18:00]  finesse  and  care  and I like that  a bit  but when it goes  back down  and you're  alone  it's like  well  you know  you can't rebound  like you can  if you were gay  I'm sure I get  people problems too  but  as much as  one goofy straight guy  I'm Timothy Treadwell  anyway that's my story  that's my story  he's like 
[02:18:30]  oh what a shame  I'm not gay  oh boy  I'd like to be  but  I like girls  let's go to  Eric in New York  Eric  Rachel  I've become  bear hoodoovers  hoodoovers  hors d'oeuvres  nasty boss  Mr. Marshall  good one Eric  well here's Tim  talking to a fox  we're almost done here  the grizzly man audio  I love you  look at you 
[02:19:00]  you're the best  little fox  but how did I  how did I come  into this work  Iris  did you ever  did you ever  get the story  I was  I was troubled  I was troubled  I drank a lot  did you know that  Iris  you wouldn't even  know what that is  but  I used to  drink to the  point of  that I guess  I was either  going to die  from it  or  or break free  of it  but nothing  nothing Iris  could get me  from  to stop  drinking  nothing  I went to  programs  I tried 
[02:19:30]  quitting myself  I did  everything  that I could  to try not  to drink  and then I  did everything  I could  to drink  from the  mule  and it was  killing me  until I  discovered  this land  of bears  and realized  that they  were in such  such great  danger  that they  they needed  a caretaker  they needed  someone to  look after  them  but not a  drunk person  not a person  messed up  so I promised  the bears  that if I  would look  over them  would they  please help  me  be a better 
[02:20:00]  person  and  they become  so inspirational  that I did  I gave up  the drinking  it was a  miracle  it was an  absolute miracle  and the  miracle was  animals  the miracle  was animals  sex with  them  guaranteed  this guy  fucked  something  an animal  one of the  foxes  a bear  something  I gotta say  this is what's  impressive  you saw the  pictures  one of them  is sitting  behind a bear  this bear  is fucking 
[02:20:30]  massive  I don't think  that's him  and this one  has been disputed  they're fake  photos  this is a fake  photo  the other one  isn't a fake  photo  it's a real  dead guy  but it isn't  the guy  that's not the  guy  I don't know  if this is him  but there's a  picture of a  guy's leg  that has been  shredded off  and his fucking  hog is hanging  out by his  intestines  and he's gotta  be packing  seven soft  and I'm like  in a panic  mode your cock  shrivels  so for this  guy to fucking  have a dick  this big  after being  attacked by  an animal  hats off 
[02:21:00]  and the animals  even know  not to eat  the taints  look at that  it's completely  intact  so this is  not him  no that's  some other  animal attack  why would  the bear  leave the  best part  maybe the  bear just  sucked it  and walked  away  I like how  his thigh  is completely  gone  but his  shin is there  and his  sneaker is  still nicely  tied on  his foot  and his  leg is  kind of  almost  in relaxed  mode  like he's  sunbathing  kicking his  leg up  a little  bit  but the  audio  pictures  are fake  they're  definitely  fake 
[02:21:30]  those aren't  the ones  no that's  not the  so you guys  want to hear from  the medical examiner  we got two clips  left  yes  oh this guy  everybody  this guy was a  creep in the movie  yeah you ever  see a movie  where it's just  everybody's good  and they all go on  to be like stars  of movies  there's an occasional  this fucking documentary  is like that  there's not  there's not a  B-list person  in this  did you ever  see the movie  we gotta get  the audio  they made it  kind of a  loosely based  documentary  I guess it's a  documentary on  the death of  Kurt Cobain 
[02:22:00]  oh yeah  that came out  about seven  eight years ago  Kurt and  Courtney  I don't know  what it was  was it called  Kurt and  Courtney  the one that  said that  she was involved  in the plotting  yeah that she got  a hitman to kill  Kurt Cobain  and stuff  yeah that was it  and they finally  find this guy  and he had a  really scary name  and this guy  couldn't kill  a mosquito  I gotta get  the audio of that  what was that  guy's name  in that movie  I don't remember  and then like  after the  like a month  or two  after filming  he was run  over by a train  he was like  a raging  alcoholic 
[02:22:30]  that was in  some obscure  like punk band  in Seattle  or something  it was  another movie  that was hilarious  you remember  when he was  driving in the car  and he goes  right here  we were gonna  use some audio  from Nirvana  but Courtney  wouldn't let us  yeah yeah yeah  what about  oh you did see  the movie  yeah and he left  that in the movie  so it was these  two like  bumbling idiots  they're like  trying to like  prove that Courtney  killed Kurt  right  and now it's  the moment  that they've been  waiting for  on film  their cameras  are rolling  they finally 
[02:23:00]  got Courtney  they only have  her for like  a couple seconds  and then all of a sudden  the screen goes blank  and all of a sudden  there's a voiceover  going  unfortunately  at this point  our battery  ran out  I remember that scene  nice professional work  another one of those movies  so worth a renting  because it's so silly  and funny  I forgot about that  I remember laughing  in the movie theater  and these people in front  were evidently like  big Nirvana fans  oh dude  once again  and they would turn around  and go like  dude  I'm like 
[02:23:30]  this is pathetic  I saw the movie  in Cambridge  and a huge Nirvana fan  most people know that  I was openly laughing  but there were people  in this theater  like you just said  taking this movie  like it was  it was the real deal  alright  here's a medical examiner  he had examined  the bodies  after the bears  ate good old  Tim and his girlfriend  alright  his girlfriend  Timothy Treadwell  and Amy Hougenot's remains  came in this large metal can 
[02:24:00]  inside this metal can  was a plastic bag  one for Timothy  and one for Amy  I mean these are human beings  and the question I ask is  first of all  who are you Timothy  who are you Amy  and what happened to you  I don't think you'll get an answer  in the case of Timothy and Amy  what I had  were body parts  just the visual input  of seeing a detached human being  before my eyes  makes my cock hard 
[02:24:30]  makes my heart  that's what I was going to say  the guy  yeah he sounds a little into it  you know what you couldn't tell  in the beginning  is he has these big silver crates  and he's like  Timothy and whatever her name was  and Amy's hose bag  came here  and these crates  and he wham  slams down  and there's this big creepy echo  yeah  he just looks like he's way  into death  like  way into it  how about an examiner  why does he act like  he's never seen a fucking  no he gets really into  describing the  what happened to these people  it's coming up  from my eyes  makes my heart race 
[02:25:00]  makes the hair stand up  on the back of my head  makes the blood flow  particularly in combination  with the contents of a tape  an audio tape  that is the sound portion  of a video tape  and when I find out  from other investigators  that the shoes  neatly placed  at the entrance  to a tent  and the cap  left on a camera  so that the visual part  could not be recorded  yet the tape  is running  so that we can hear  the sounds 
[02:25:30]  of Amy screaming  and the sounds  of Timothy  moaning  tells me that this event  occurred very very quickly  suddenly  and unexpectedly  I clearly can hear  her screaming  stop  and go away  maybe run away  there's a lot  of background noise  Timothy is moaning  and I hear  Amy beating  on the top  of this bear's head  with a frying pan  and Timothy  is saying  run away  let go 
[02:26:00]  run away  run away  Amy  run away  Amy had a great  deal of conviction  she had a great  deal of conviction  in this relationship  we know that  although in the past  she was more  standoffish  she didn't get  as close to the bear  as Timothy did  she was more cautious  however I know  that at the moment  of death  when one is  is being tried 
[02:26:30]  to the maximum  of one's ability  to be faithful  to stick to a situation  to be loyal  if one can say that  to Timothy  she stayed there  and she fought  with Timothy  she did not run away  Amy  we know  fought back  for approximately  six minutes  Amy stayed  with  her lover  with  her partner  with her mate  and with the bear 
[02:27:00]  ultimately  she stayed  with the bear  in the situation  definitely  a James Blunt  moment  right there  for her  what was she  going to fucking  run to  you're in the woods  with a bunch of bears  where you going  where's the audio  of him explaining  I slowly sort of  walk away  like  alright Tim  take it easy  it's the way  you kind of  wanted to go out  it's not the way  I want to go  so I'm going to  be leaving  she's like  you haven't 
[02:27:30]  fucked me  in years  he wouldn't have  to tell me  to run away  he would have  been like  run away  where are you  here's the director  or the main guy  listening to the  actual audio  of him being  eaten alive  and his girlfriend  go ahead  I like just his  brutal  reenactment  of what they were  saying  and he was like  run away  run away  it was more like  run away  run away  but at this point  there was a lot  of background noise  it wasn't one of 
[02:28:00]  those quiet  getting eaten alive  moments  wasn't mixed well  they really didn't  have good mic  placement  this is the big  bummer of the  whole movie  because they  didn't play the  audio  but this guy  you get to  watch him  listen to the  audio  with headphones  on  he gets to  hear we  can't  so there  might be  some dead  space in  here as  he's listening  to the  audio  I don't  know  this is  Timothy's  camera  during the  fatal attack  there was  no time  to remove 
[02:28:30]  the lens  cap  Joel Pellevec  allowed me  to listen  to the  audio  I hear rain  and I hear  Amy  get away  get away  go away  yeah  he's listening  he's still  listening  more listening 
[02:29:00]  I bring  nothing to  the table  huh  where did  that come  from  as he  continues  is he  laughing  truly you  must never 
[02:29:30]  listen to  this  I know  I'm never  going to  and you  must never  look at the  photos that  I've seen  at the  coroner's  office  I will  never  look at  them  yeah  yeah  chicken  like  and you  must never  look at the  photos while  listening to  the audio  now you  know why  no one's  going to  hear it  I think 
[02:30:00]  you should  not keep  it  you should  destroy it  yeah  thank you  I think  that's what  you should  do  yeah  okay  because it  will be  the white  elephant in  your room  all your  life  she was  later killed  by a white  elephant  which is  an odd  coincidence  of that  situation  you must  burn it  you must  dig a long  ditch  and get  the people  to load  them in  and cover  them with  kerosene  and burn 
[02:30:30]  them so  we are not  our crimes  will not  be seen  oh  the tape  burn the  tape  you should  never listen  to this  while looking  at those  pictures  while having  your ass  eaten on  a bare rug  near a  fireplace  what did  the girlfriend  look like  oof  she looked  like she  could have  been in the  woods  being filmed  the kind  of girl  that had  to give  him the  benefit  of the  doubt  yeah  exactly  also known  as a  fag hag  fag hag  fag bear 
[02:31:00]  hag  wow  what year  was this  a few years  ago I guess  something like  that  did the audio  still exist  I think  there's got  to be more  than one  had to get  out there  somewhere  the cops  they always  do  the cops  check this  one  the cops  for the  Christmas  party  you gotta  think  Murphy  ran off  the tape  look  all the  shit  they've  seen  they're  like  eating  lasagna  it doesn't  buck them  well I'm  making an  offer  $25  to whoever  produces that  audio  holy Jesus  that's a lot  of money  and tickets  to my 
[02:31:30]  February  24th  25th  Albany  shows  wow  that's  right  I don't  think  the listeners  will be  sending  an audio  of a  bear  eating  somebody  $25  alright  you owe  me  listen to the  panty sounds  that's him  ripping the  flesh off  the bear's  body  alright we'll 
[02:32:00]  leave with  one last clip  here from  Tim talking  to the  bears  well I just  want to  discuss that  fight with  Mickey Bear  right here  he's right  he got  on film  a crazy  fight  between  two  bears  a very  violent  violent  fight  that was  a lot  of fun  to check  out in  the background  two heavy  weights  and he's  about 50  feet away  from what  just happened  well I just  want to discuss  that fight  with Mickey Bear  right here  he's right  next to me  here in  the Grizzly  Sanctuary  on the  Tide  flat  sat  and off  to camera  left  Mick  you underestimated 
[02:32:30]  Sergeant Brown  you went in  for the hit  he seemed  to be  rope-a-doping  you like  he wasn't  that tough  and then  once you  you banged  into him  man he turned  out to be  one heck  of a rough  bear  a very rough  bear  and I'm telling  you I was so  scared I almost  got sick to my  stomach watching  you fight  and then when  he knocked  you down  and you were  down on your  back  it was terrible  it was terrible  you can't win  Ron  I'm not duking  it out for any  girl like that  I'm telling you  right now I'm not  duking it out for  any girl  but I  you know what 
[02:33:00]  well I've had  my troubles  with the girls  yeah yeah  and I'll tell you  something  if Saturn was  a female human  I could just  see how beautiful  she is as a bear  I've always called  her Michelle Pfeiffer  of bears out here  Michelle Pfeiffer  alright you lay there  I'm gonna go off  with your girlfriend  don't beat me up  over it  I'm  I'm cool  even the bag  knows he's gay  things are bad  for you with  the human women  but not so bad  that I haven't  been hitting on bears yet  the bear's like  yeah fine  you can sleep  in the same bed  with her  I don't care 
[02:33:30]  that guy  the bear looks like  Helvina  that guy is so gay  and so in denial  that he's gotta say  things like that  I've had some trouble  with the women  but you know  don't worry about it  it is a movie  of acceptance  it's unbelievable  through the whole film  he's talking about girls  it's why he's there  doesn't understand why  people think he's gay  he's not gay  it would be better  to be gay  finally he's attacked  by some fucking  bear in skinhead boots

[02:42:00]  but seriously folks  yeah  but seriously  i i  last time i had a  girlfriend was in the  mental hospital we never  really broke up  we just each underwent  shock treatments and  forgot we were dating  that was a problem when i  was in the mental  hospital i used to  forget things like uh  i used to loan some  really creepy guy named  jeff five dollars and  i'd forget i loaned to  to him after i got  shock treatment so i got  smart so i'm writing  things down of things i  needed to remember and  here's a list from like  10 or 15 years ago of  things i need to remember  after i got shock 
[02:42:30]  treatments  stop eating so much  you fat ass  convince angry black  muslim roommate you're  i'm not the devil  vanilla ice rocks  jeffrey dommer owes you  five dollars  holy shit i think the  setup was a little  wordy yeah yeah i know  but i think i think it  gets laughs yeah it gets  laughs well it helps that  you speed through it  yeah i like the fact that  do another joke do the  setup really fast just  like you did it because  that's working someone in  pal talk is just writing  holy hell holy hell now 
[02:43:00]  you know what's good  about you a lot of  comedians make the mistake  of actually trying to  pause or change inflection  yeah and that kind of  ruins flow you're you're  actually the way you do  it is perfect and if  shock treatments can be  very important to your  act you might want to  learn how to say shock  oh okay how do you say  shock shock  it doesn't sound like  that right i might have  said it wrong i'm nervous  i'm not there  it's not like i'm no  i'm serious it's not  like track my uh my  counselor's here tonight  yeah uh she has this  policy she pretend  mini boom bots she  pretends she doesn't  know who i am when she  sees me out in public 
[02:43:30]  that's cool i pretend i  don't know fat chicks  you like that one i like  that one i hope he loved  that one a good one  there's a lot of  awkward moments when  you're schizophrenic like  when you jump off a bridge  and try and kill yourself  and just break your legs at  the bottom of the bridge  it's awkward when you try  and call the cab and try  and explain why you just  need a ride to the top of  the bridge  say try a couple more  times than that and i think  it'll be good  yeah  you know what though you need  one or two more  i gotta know a little more  about you  i gotta know a little more  about you  you're schizophrenic  yeah 
[02:44:00]  now uh you said something  when i was getting the  camera i didn't hear about  medication you can't afford  it anymore  well i'm i was getting it  free because i'm not  working  and but now that they know  i won the lottery i'm  probably not going to get  it free anymore  but if you won the lottery  you can afford it  i spent all my lottery tickets  money on lottery on other  lottery tickets  so you won 50,000  yeah i blew it  and you bought 50,000 worth  of lottery tickets  but i'm gonna make it back  selling t-shirts  can i get my my space

[02:45:30]  lottery twice  are astronomical  i don't know why  i didn't do that  you could have done  a fifty fifty  you could have had  a coin toss  yeah  yeah  maybe next time right  yeah i guess  yeah just go to a casino  bet on red or black  bet on red or black  you got a 48% chance  of winning  yeah what's your closing joke  um  this  this comedy set  was also dedicated  to the memory  of my ex-girlfriend  she's still alive  things to do  i get it  kill  kill your  ex
