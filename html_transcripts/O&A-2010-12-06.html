<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion of Dennis Leary's new book, a compilation of his tweets, which the hosts found amusingly simple yet successful.  They joked about creating their own similar books, criticizing Leary's book design, specifically the alternating pages of tweets and photos.  This transitioned into a brief, unexpected public service announcement about safe driving.

The hosts then eagerly awaited the arrival of Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz from "American Pickers," launching into a discussion of other reality shows like "Pawn Stars" and "Auction Kings."  The scheduled appearance of Joey Pants was cancelled due to a back injury, prompting speculation on his likely frustrated reaction.

The conversation returned to Opie's extensive tweeting and the potential for his own tweet compilation book, incorporating his own photos.  This led to a discussion of the many weddings Opie had recently attended.  The show then shifted to the NFL, covering Brett Favre's injury, Peyton Manning's performance, and the upcoming Jets-Patriots game. A caller, "Trucker Dan," contributed insights into Peyton Manning's chances of breaking Brett Favre's consecutive starts record.

The show concluded with a segment on the dismal performance of the New York Islanders hockey team, their poor attendance, and a player's comment about needing divine intervention to improve. Opie and Anthony expressed their disappointment with the team, speculating on the problems with ownership and management.

[00:00:30]  Music  Music  Music  Music  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, here they go again. 
[00:03:30]  It's a fun, dopey radio show.  Not just any radio show.  A radio show that inspires beyond your wildest dreams.  The show is a lot funnier on N.E.W.  The show's host, Anthony Camilla and Greg O.B. Hughes.  It's an controversial team.  Six years without getting fired, a new record for us.  It's just astounding to me.  I didn't want to say it's racist, but goddamn.  This show will rock as best as we can possibly do this radio show.  I'm going to go home and whack to a tranny later.  There you go.  God, we just lost our demo, man. 
[00:04:00]  What's wrong with you?  This is the last straw for the watching radio duo.  The O.B.  Ken Anthony show.  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  There we go.  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.B.  and Anthony show.  My microphone is Fabrizi.  It's Fabrizi.  I like it.  Got a busy show, huh? 
[00:04:30]  Apparently.  Dennis Leary is going to be promoting his pamphlet today.  Yeah, that thing's, well, it's his book.  I had this idea over the summer.  I swear to God.  Dennis Leary has a book, and basically,  it's all his tweets of the past year.  Yeah.  And I said that to my wife over the summer.  I'm like, you know what would be an easy book to do?  Yeah.  Is you just take your tweeter, my, a tweeter,  my, take a Twitter feed,  and then just comb through it  and get the best tweets of the past year,  maybe the past two years,  and put out a book. 
[00:05:00]  And that's exactly what Dennis Leary did.  Are you claiming hoo-hoo?  Absolutely.  Are you calling hoo-hoos?  But it's pretty, it's a very obvious idea.  But this thing is.  Yeah.  I was annoyed at the simplicity of it.  Like, God damn, what a good idea.  I came up with this over the summer.  Dennis doesn't know,  but I came up with this exact same idea.  But instead of using, like, stock pictures  like he's using in the book,  you would use some of the pictures you took  from the past year.  Yeah.  All you would need is, what,  25, 30 of your pictures of the past year 
[00:05:30]  that you tweet,  a few tweets,  and you got a book on your hands.  Yes.  This is a fucking good one, though.  It's L-Y-F-A-O  at 140 characters left.  Last year, fucking asshole.  It's just really well done.  Like, uh...  I'm just...  For Twitter.  I'm, like, annoyed that I didn't think of it.  I did think of it,  and I didn't do anything about it with the idea.  I was too busy working out.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh, were ya?  It's workout gym.  Yeah, you know me.  I was in the gym.  Here you go.  LeBron goes to Miami,  and then Dennis Leary writes,  Cleveland announces going out a business sale. 
[00:06:00]  That's one page of the book.  That page is done.  Page 40 is done.  And then there's a picture of LeBron James on page 41.  So that page is done.  And then you turn it over,  and there's Dick Cheney,  so that page 42 is done.  I thought...  So the next time there's writing,  it's page 43 that says,  Cheney gets heart pump implant.  Let's all pray it's made by BP.  So now page 43 is done.  You go to page 44.  It's a guy eating a piece of pie,  and then finally you got more words on page 45.  But by words, it's just one tweet.  Yes.  I thought it was a book with a bunch of tweets 
[00:06:30]  and maybe something about the Twitter culture or something.  No, it's one page is giant letters.  Yeah.  It's like fucking...  All right.  It's like Regan's bit.  The clock.  Yeah.  The big clock.  It gets even better.  The whole book is 104 pages.  104 pages.  Every other page is a picture.  Is a picture.  So there's 52 pages with tweets on them.  Yeah.  $18.  God damn it. 
[00:07:00]  You know what it is, too?  Could be the easiest project ever done by a celebrity.  He didn't even have to do it.  Here's my Twitter.  Like, not even.  Somebody else could have put that whole thing together.  That's what I'm saying.  Here's my iPhone.  Yeah, yeah.  Here they are.  Here's my Twitter feed.  Put a book together for me.  It's great toilet reading.  That's what a book like this is.  It's a cool gift, and you sit on the bowl.  This fucking thing by the toilet.  This is good for a...  This is a good log-dropping book.  I'm telling you, because it's a perfect...  Yes.  It's a good size to hold while you shit. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, it's not too big.  God damn it.  Fuck.  And then it's good for just, you know, a couple of dumps.  My Twitter book's coming out.  Toon, soon, too.  Oh, is it?  Toon, soon, soon, soon.  Yes.  Toon, soon is a woman who jerked me off once in a massage parlor.  Toon, soon.  Yeah.  She wasn't into the proper draping?  No, no, no, no.  She allowed me to...  She didn't need the proper draping?  No, she was more into the California Esalon.  What the hell is that?  Well, that's Esalon.  Esalon is long, flowing strokes.  When they say California Esalon, they mean they'll be nude. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, really?  But if they say Esalon, a lot of times they say with clothing.  What does it mean when they brush your ball bag?  That they're good eggs.  That means they get a tip.  That's what that means.  I just want to quickly do a public service.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm not going to be long on this or anything.  It's just quick.  Sure.  It annoys me all the time, and I always talk about it, but I'm not going to talk about it  for a long time.  That means this is going to take two hours.  No, no, no.  Two seconds.  Two seconds.  Swear to God.  Swear to God.  A lot of people listen to us driving, right?  Yes.  So if you're driving right now, right now, look out your windshield.  You're looking out your windshield.  You're driving. 
[00:08:30]  Is there anyone in front of you?  Okay.  Now look in your rear view mirror.  Do it right now.  Are there people behind you?  If the answer is yes to both of these, get the fuck out of the way.  Thank you.  That's all I wanted to say.  It's that easy.  Do it right now.  It's that easy.  Do it right now.  It's something we all could do.  That's it.  Look right now.  Windshield.  Rear view mirror.  Cars in front of you?  No?  Cars behind you?  Yes?  Move over!  Thank you.  It's a simple thing that could make the whole world better. 
[00:09:00]  So much easier.  Look what you just did.  Less stress for everybody.  You just made the whole world better.  That's it.  A lot of blinkers going on right now, I hope.  So there you go.  Dennis Leary's book.  And then a great show, American Pickers.  We got the guys coming in today, man.  Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz.  This show is massive.  Oh, you love it, huh?  Massively huge.  I've seen a couple moments.  Isn't that coincidence that Opie likes American Pickers?  Less picking going on, though.  I haven't seen, by the way, I haven't seen picking in a year.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  By missing.  No, because I cut the... 
[00:09:30]  It's a joke.  I cut the nose hairs.  I got a nose hair trimmer.  Did you trim?  They don't tickle.  And boy, sometimes when I put that in there, you hear some noise.  All of a sudden you're...  Sounds like...  Like how much shit is in there?  Like a weed whacker?  Yeah.  Sounds exactly like that.  But they're coming in.  What a great show.  They find some fucking great stuff.  You see the premise of some of these shows and you go, this can't possibly be interesting.  Yeah.  And then you start watching it and you realize, I'm hooked. 
[00:10:00]  I'm hooked.  I like American Pickers better than Pawn Shop.  That one and the Pawn Stars I like.  Oh, Pawn Stars.  Excuse me.  Right.  Then that other one with the fucking stupid auction house.  I've been like watching that one.  Which one?  That's Auction Kings.  Auction Kings.  Oh, I haven't seen that one yet.  Yeah.  It's fucking got an auction house and people bring shit in.  They want it auctioned off.  And then at the end of the show, they have the big auction.  Very cool.  And you see if the people get the price they want.  You know, there's an auction house on the east side.  You could just walk through.  Yeah, the famous one.  Sotheby's, whatever it's called.  Oh, Sotheby's, yeah.  I didn't know they had an actual building. 
[00:10:30]  And it looks like you could walk through.  And it almost looks like a museum, but you could buy shit, I think.  And you're like looking shit and then bid on it and stuff?  I was stuck at a red light and I looked over to my left.  I said, wait a minute.  Can you actually go walking through that and pick up some stuff that they didn't maybe sell  at an actual auction?  I don't know.  I'll have to do more research on that.  And then we got Joey Pants coming in to promote sauce.  Sauce.  What's he selling?  Sauce.  Sauce?  Yes.  I think so.  Or some kind of pasta.  It's pasta.  I don't know.  I don't know what it is. 
[00:11:00]  Joey Pants pasta.  Driver's canceled.  He had a back problem?  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  That was my big exciting.  I know.  I thought he was coming in.  He kind of likes us, I'm hearing.  I think so.  He kind of likes doing our show, I'm hearing.  Or that's just more bullshit from publicists.  He really enjoys doing your show, and he's so bummed out that he had to catch a flight  back to California to take care of his back.  He's not bummed out.  He doesn't even know he was doing our show, I'm thinking.  He's not bummed out.  I like to think that he's bummed out that he's not doing the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, I would like to. 
[00:11:30]  I bet you he has no clue.  They were going to give him a schedule here.  This is what you're doing today.  Dude, I'm telling you, hey, ONA, what's up?  Jimmy, how you been?  We'd be like, hi, Rich.  Ten minutes into the interview, I would have said something like, I remember the last time  you were here, and he would have said, well, have I done this show?  No, I don't remember.  It would have been a heartbreaker.  Right.  Oh, someone's saying they would buy my version of that book.  I should still do it.  Yeah, but mine would be my pictures.  Think about it.  I'm obsessed with this, because it's not even his own pictures. 
[00:12:00]  Dude, think about it.  Just because he put one out, other people could put the exact same book out, and it's a completely  different book.  I know, I don't want to feel like I'm ripping someone off, though.  No, it's like saying, look, I do a sitcom, you do a sitcom, this guy does one.  It's not that you're ripping off, you know, it's just a whole different content of the  same idea.  It started out as a joke, because obviously the whole sunset thing has taken on a life  of its own with my Twitter.  I don't even bring this to the show.  I probably get 20 to 30 sunset pictures a day now. 
[00:12:30]  How do you sort through the best ones?  Oh, my God.  And then if there's one that really catches my eye, I retweet at this point.  But it's gotten out of hand.  So then the joke was, I should put out a sunset book as a joke, as a coffee table book.  A coffee table book, Jerry.  But I would include everyone's pictures from around the country, you know, and it would  be like a group project.  And then I'm like, that's stupid.  And then I went into, well, I should do one about my whole Twitter feed.  And then I'm like, but add all my pictures that I get and the ones I take.  Now, Dennis Leary did the fucking book. 
[00:13:00]  But he didn't do the picture.  He didn't do the picture.  So maybe I got a shot.  Anyone could put out a Twitter book.  Yeah.  Honestly, it's, it's, every idea is different.  Like, every book would be different because it's just different fucking tweets based on  your own personal feed.  All three of us should do it then.  Let's all put out Twitter books.  Whatever.  That's fine.  He literally put out a good friend of the show.  It's been a while, so.  When's he here?  Tomorrow, right?  Today.  Oh, is he today?  That's why we're promoting.  That's why the book's in front of us.  It's a smart, uh.  Hey, uh, your Cowboys won again.  Yeah, I was watching the game.  It was in the gym. 
[00:13:30]  And, uh, they were down by, uh.  In the gym?  Yes.  On the treadmill.  And they were down by seven.  And it was third and goal.  And they didn't get in.  So the way they do, go for it on a fourth down and get in?  I don't know.  I was traveling.  I had another wedding in Philly.  Dog.  Look at me.  Fuck.  Oh, that's brutal.  You're another one?  I don't get it.  I lost track of how many weddings I've been to since, uh, May.  I haven't.  None.  I went to your wedding a couple years ago.  And I think that's the last one I've been to. 
[00:14:00]  Probably the last one I went to.  See, but I like the people down there.  I like a lot.  I love you a lot.  I don't feel like it's a chore or anything.  The whole wedding thing is a bitch, though.  There's been a run of a lot of weddings and things going on in Philly.  A big run.  Run of a lot of things going on.  I just hate the idea of weddings.  And then you throw in the new kid.  So you've got to bring the new kid down, you know, down to his other roots.  Yeah.  Dude, that energy.  Like, uh.  Weddings.  I've gotten to one since yours.  It was, uh, some of my girls. 
[00:14:30]  Once since mine.  Since yours.  I don't fucking know.  I've probably been to ten since my own wedding.  Haven't even been to another.  Probably.  Oh, way.  I'm averaging about five a year.  I say no all the time.  It's not that I don't like people, but I'm just like, I work five days a week.  I work at night.  Yeah, but everyone could lay from, I don't know, call it like, probably more your upper  twenties to early to mid thirties.  You do a shitload of weddings.  You're dizzy from doing so many weddings.  So then I took a break, obviously, but having the younger wife, now all of them are in that 
[00:15:00]  area.  Getting married.  So now I'm getting the second wave of everybody's getting married around me.  I'd be like, you have fun.  Yeah.  You have fun at that wedding.  I'm not going.  Yeah, absolutely not.  My chick's younger too.  No way.  I don't feel like it.  I don't really feel like it's a chore, but holy shit.  Spectro in Michigan.  Dennis Leary has this, I'm obsessed with this book because of the simplicity of it.  Do you know he's only tweeted 714 times and he made a book?  Do you know that I've tweeted 4,400 times? 
[00:15:30]  You know how great my book would be?  It'd be a lot thicker.  All I need is a hundred tweets out of 4,400.  That's easy.  Yeah.  There's gold in there somewhere.  There certainly is.  Fuck.  He just got on Twitter and he did this.  Twitter book.  Twitter book.  That's someone's great idea.  So I did not watch.  Whisper it in his ear.  I did not watch.  I didn't.  No.  And all the teams I care about are kind of.  Well, not kind of.  We got the big game tonight.  Tonight's the big game.  Yeah, we got the Jets and Pats tonight. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  And Bob Kelly might be coming over to the game if you want to come over too, Jimmy, because  you're in the hood there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bobby.  We might be doing a little Monday Night Football at my house tonight.  Whoa.  Bobby's a big Pats fan.  That ought to be fun.  Both nine and two.  Yeah, the Cowboys beat the Colts in overtime as Manning throws four interceptions.  Manning's becoming a bust.  He's not having a good fucking year, man.  Yeah, he's having a bad year.  Four.  What's he won?  Two Super Bowls?  Uh, Travis isn't in there.  I would, I, uh, wow. 
[00:16:30]  I'm just going to.  Only one, Danny?  Oh.  I was going to just say yes.  Ah.  But it's only one.  Okay.  50-50 chance of getting it right.  Each Manning brother's only won one Super Bowl?  I think.  Yeah.  I think that's about right.  I thought Manning had two.  I really did.  One.  So, and then Brett Favre got beat up again.  Brett Favre is fucking beating the shit out of his body for a shitty team.  Just enough of Brett.  Just to keep that dumb record of his alive.  Exactly.  On the first play.  On the first play of the game?  Was that the first play of the game?  Yeah.  Did you see the hit to his back? 
[00:17:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's too old to take a hit to the back like that.  Oh.  Up or back.  Everyone's saying that's it.  You think that's it?  Yeah.  Everybody, a lot of people think it is, but I think a lot of people are just overreacting.  If he can't play Sunday, why would he play the rest of the year?  Because there's no reason to sacrifice his body.  Because obviously they're not going to make the playoffs or anything like that.  At this point, he's just going for the record.  Yeah, I know.  He probably is praying that he's done so he could just finally retire.  He's getting beat up every week.  That's not what the fucking game is.  It's not going for the record.  How about you fucking get someone that could play? 
[00:17:30]  How about you keep your body intact?  Maybe he just doesn't want to go home to his wife.  He's going to be a wreck.  He's going to be one of those fucking guys that is defined by the sport.  Yeah.  He can't leave the sport.  And all of a sudden, five years go by and you see him and he's barely walking right.  He's at one of those places like signing fucking at a sporting goods store or a sports store.  Signing store at Roosevelt Field?  Yeah, Roosevelt Field.  And he's like limping.  Someone's got to help him in because he's just destroyed. 
[00:18:00]  Red fire.  I like the video tape shit off of it.  I know the TV.  The crew shit off their TV.  Yeah.  Watch this hit.  He's scrambling.  He's saying that all the time.  It's radio.  That was a good fucking hit.  Knocked him right the fuck down.  Oh, the wind came out of him on that one.  Oh, man.  You think other players respect him?  I think they have to.  I think they did.  As a guy, I'm saying as a tough dude who's been playing.  No, I think they did.  And then too many comebacks.  It's like if he would have just left when he left the first time even, it would have been great. 
[00:18:30]  Been looked at like now he's.  Talked about fun.  Hit is in front.  That's an interception.  It's picked off by Florence.  That's another pick.  The 18th for Brett Favre.  I didn't know it was the first play of the game.  It says Brett Favre gets crushed.  Last play of career.  He's pulling a fucking Joe Namath in a Rams uniform.  You know how many people would be so happy if the last throw of his career is an interception?  Is that an interception?  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Poor Brett Favre.  Poor multi-millionaire.  That never has to worry.  Another day in his life.  Florentine's tweets about him.  Never has to work again.  And he's only 40, 41.  Jim hates him.  That's a threat.  I know.  So much.  Yeah.  He hates Manning, too.  What was his fucking...  I hate him.  Why do you hate Manning?  Jim just...  He's a weird guy.  He hates a lot of odd sports people.  And he's relentless.  Florentine's relentless when he hates somebody.  Manning's a bore.  The brothers are a bore.  Wait, what did he write? 
[00:19:30]  Oh.  Peyton Manning threw four more interceptions today.  Maybe he should be studying game film instead of filming those awful commercials.  Fucking goober.  Fucking goober.  Gotta do it as a Florentine, which makes it even better.  Jim's the master.  He's very, very logical.  He's very hard to argue with.  Because you're like, yeah, I guess he should be not doing commercials.  He's so much fucking fun, that guy.  I know.  He's really funny.  Trucker Dan.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Yeehaw.  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  Good news for you here. 
[00:20:00]  If Brett Favre is done, the next consecutive starting streak in the NFL for quarterback is  Peyton Manning, and he only has to play five and a half more years to catch him.  Wow.  Wow.  Five and a half football years.  Without missing a game.  It's a lot of fucking years.  How many years is that in regular years?  They asked Peyton Manning about four years.  That's got to be two generations in regular years.  That's tough.  That ain't happening.  They asked Peyton Manning about four years ago if he thought he'd ever catch Brett Favre  for consecutive starts, and he looked at the reporter like he was completely retarded 
[00:20:30]  and said, I think we better wait until he's done before he asks me that.  Wow.  Might be now.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, exactly.  Start the clock ticking.  Thank you, sir.  All right, good.  I didn't know that.  I didn't know that he's got the record by that much.  Mm-hmm.  And then, uh, what else there?  Oh, Jeter.  Jeter.  Oh, you wanted to say the Islanders?  No, I was going to say your Islanders.  Wow, tearing it up.  They're not my fucking Islanders.  I'm officially not a fan.  You've officially given up. 
[00:21:00]  And people are beating the shit out of me, but when I feel like my team is back in the  NHL, then I'll become a fan.  I'm not one of these guys that needs my team in the playoffs every year and going for a  Stanley Cup run every year.  They are so fucking bad.  Yeah.  They've lost 17 out of 18 games.  Do you understand that?  17.  Do you understand how impossible that is?  That is really hard enough.  They have five wins for the year.  Yesterday at the Coliseum, another game I blew off, they had 7,700 people in the seats. 
[00:21:30]  That, that, I think that's paid.  That's like season ticket holders.  I think they count the season ticket holders and, and a lot of.  So those are empty seats.  A lot of people, yeah.  If you have season tickets, you're not going to go to every game.  Mm-mm.  And you're certainly not going to go if the team is this bad.  They're horrendous.  Yeah.  And, and, and, and one of the players said that he needs, the team needs help from God.  He goes, we need, he goes, God's a little busy right now.  I always fuck up his name, Wisniewski, I guess.  He, uh, he goes, we need help from above. 
[00:22:00]  And in sports terms, you would think, oh, the GM, the owner needs to help.  He goes, no.  He goes, no, I mean, way above.  We need help from God.  They are losing a lot of really close games on top of it, which makes it so strange.  It's, it's bad play and a touch of bad luck?  I don't know.  Is that it?  I don't know what it is.  I mean, they're not getting blown out of these games, but they're certainly not, uh, you know, scoring a lot.  Like yesterday, the Flyers beat them 3-2.  And they had a lead in the third period, and then they blew it again. 
[00:22:30]  Well, that's kind of good, because then you never know, next year they could come back and actually win,  because it's not that they're completely lousy, they're just losing them by one.  We'll get another draft pick, but I don't know what's going on with the team.  I don't know if it's a tax write-off for Charles Wang.  I don't know, because I've talked about this off and on, that the Coliseum is completely falling apart.  And I watch a lot of great players just march through the Islanders organization and go somewhere else.  And be really good.  And then they finally decide to keep one of the guys, uh, DiPietro, and they give him a 15-year fucking contract. 
[00:23:00]  And the goalie is broken.  He's a broken goalie.  And he gets busted.  He's broken. </pre>
