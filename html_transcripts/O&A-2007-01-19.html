<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing critique of the “overly nice” radio hosts John and Jeff, contrasting their style with their own brand of irreverent, profanity-laced humor.  Bob Kelly was in studio, while Jim Norton was absent (in Chicago).  The death of a woman participating in a water-drinking contest provided a significant topic of discussion,  with Opie and Anthony jokingly referencing the media coverage and their own MSNBC appearance regarding the event.  Bob Saget called in, sharing humorous anecdotes and travel plans.  Listeners frequently called in with increasingly outrageous and offensive suggestions for "We're two guys..." promos, parodying John and Jeff's style.  Kevin Smith was announced as a future guest.

The show then delved into a detailed account of their MSNBC interview with Alison Stewart about the water-drinking contest death.  They described the interview's chaotic nature and their deliberate strategy of peppering their answers with inside jokes and references to their own show, including lines from recurring character "Steve" and past controversies like the St. Patrick's Day incident and the water-death itself.  They also mentioned a former advertiser, Stack or Two, and a commercial featuring "Psycho Mark." A caller insulted Opie and Anthony while praising Howard Stern, sparking a discussion about Stern’s work ethic and listener loyalty.  Anthony was credited with successfully integrating inside jokes while Opie's approach was described as more chaotic.  The hosts discussed the gravity of the tragedy and potential legal ramifications for the radio hosts involved, mentioning a past marshmallow-and-bunny-suit incident and employee "E-Rock" who recreated the stunt. Opie revealed he had to mute his phone during the MSNBC interview due to laughter.  The conversation shifted to Bill O'Reilly and Mancow Muller's contrasting coverage of the story, and included numerous anecdotes about past conflicts and humorous incidents involving their relationships, ex-girlfriends, and fellow radio personalities, alongside reflections on the challenges of being edgy in modern radio.

A heated debate followed concerning Man Cow's claim of having the fastest-growing radio show. Opie and Anthony vehemently refuted this, insulting Man Cow and contrasting his smaller market presence with their own reach in major markets like New York, Philadelphia, and Boston. The conversation then turned to a critique of American Idol, focusing on its "retarded" contestants segment and Rosie O'Donnell's commentary.  A listener called in to discuss a segment from their weekend show where female co-host D.D. was spanked.  This led to a discussion, with Kevin Smith (now present in studio) participating, of gay community terminology for different body types.  A running joke about D.D. licking Bob Kelly's anus was established but never acted upon.  Promotional announcements and the sign-off concluded this segment.


A subsequent segment featured a prolonged, sexually explicit role-playing scenario with D.D., involving repeated spanking.  Audio clips from the fatal water-drinking contest were played, revealing the contestant's deteriorating condition and the DJs' responses.  The hosts discussed the legal ramifications and speculated on the contestant's motivations and the DJs' actions.  The conversation included various sexual acts and objects, a graphic caller story, and further analysis of the legal aspects of the water-drinking contest, including interviews with legal experts and news reporters.  The St. Patrick's Cathedral incident was briefly mentioned.  Kevin Smith was present, but his participation was limited.

The following segment revisited the water-drinking contest death, comparing it to a past incident involving employee Eric Nagel choking on marshmallows.  Opie and Anthony expressed sympathy for the victim's family while acknowledging the unintended consequences of the contest.  Kevin Smith and Bob Kelly were in studio, promoting an Opie and Anthony Dance Party Weekend. A disastrous promotional video featuring Steve C. and Bill was analyzed. The conversation ranged from Anthony's urinary control to poker,  Kevin Smith's movie *Catch and Release*, a discussion of several films (*Children of Men*, *300*, *Unknown*, *High Tension*, *Perfume*, *Rocky Balboa*, *Stomp the Yard*, *The Last King of Scotland*), and the Isaiah Washington controversy.


The final segment discussed an actor's use of a homophobic slur at the Golden Globes, a recurring humorous scene from *CSI: Miami* featuring David Caruso, rumors about Ryan Phillippe, several pranks (Michael Jackson, the president, an elevator prank by Jimmy, and an airplane prank by Kenny), and Kevin Smith's experiences with MySpace and *Catch and Release*.  The segment concluded with a humorous struggle to find a suitable sign-off.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts frequently used crude and offensive language, with the humor largely derived from shock value, anecdotal storytelling, and their reactions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  If this doesn't make you want to throw out a failure, the most annoying thing on two legs, what a bore fest, who cares about the funny, just bring me the porn, aren't we dumb, hee hee, oh do you want to play, Anthony, I will beat children about the head, Jim Norton, I'm dancing, I'm dancing, I'm just, I'm a naked whore, it's indescribable, I'm trying, the rape that's covered by insurance, some of the comments they make are uncalled for, 
[00:00:30]  why are you crying, the virus finally hit him, but with Jimmy you never know, it could be AIDS, no, yes, yes, it's the O.P. and Anthony show, the virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. today, and, I hate you, but enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  Good morning.  Obviously something very important is about to happen, of course, it has to be, are we a bunch of asses or what, this dramatic music, sirens, oh get out of the way, oh, oh, oh, oh, something's happening, no, it's just us, with our stupid opinions, good morning, good morning, yeah, presenting them like they're facts, just cause there's a mic in front of us, 
[00:01:30]  well, yeah, that's what everyone else does, that's what the news does, I was just all annoyed inside, just annoyed, why, Mike Woods, the weather guy, because they, I drive in every day, and I listen to the news, 
[00:02:00]  for preparation to this fine radio program, listen to the news, and I, I jockey back and forth between two of the news stations here in New York, try to catch any national and local stories going on,  and I must have heard about, between the two stations, six weather forecasts, you know how they do everything on like five or two minute intervals, 
[00:02:30]  they get every story in within two minutes, and then back to traffic and weather and stuff, and I got a pretty accurate line on what the weather's gonna be in New York City over the next few days,  a basic winter forecast, it's gonna be cold, cloudy, it's gonna be cloudy, and some like drizzly, maybe wet flakes coming down kind of thing,  well, Mike Woods gets on and goes, and I'll be talking about the snow coming to our area to the city this weekend, stay tuned, 
[00:03:00]  and you're like, you lying sack, you know why, cause snow equals watch longer, right, snow equals, you're gonna turn, oh, snow,  snow, I gotta run and get some bread and milk from the grocery store, not snow in January, watch the weather, cause he said snow,  and then he gets on and talks about how like a wet flake or two is gonna fall in the city, and then they try to pawn off that they weren't lying, 
[00:03:30]  because, well, north of the city's gonna get some snow, yeah, like the Arctic Circle, Canada, those places, there's no snow,  it's not gonna be snow, that's why they sensationalize everything like that, and it pisses me off,  that's why at any chance we get, I love turning the screws back to the news,  well, yeah, well, the other day, I think it was last week, we had our first snowfall here in New York,  did we?  it was, I think it was 10 total snowflakes, but the news covered it, they actually covered it, 
[00:04:00]  like it was a snow storm, like it was a big storm, they actually had to lay like a black tarp down,  so you could see that it was snow falling from the sky, and it melted immediately,  because you had to look really close to make sure it was actually snow, that news stinks,  there's no, LA at this point has gotten more snow than New York City, it's snowing in LA for some  reason, they definitely have more flakes, they're freaking, oh, there you go, speaking of, oh, well, 
[00:04:30]  speaking of LA flakes, the hell is on before us, oh my god, you don't listen, oh, well,  you know the gag, I mean, it's on in the bathroom, yeah, and look, we're on in a lot of cities,  so don't be insulting, we're not talking about the show before us in your fine city,  we're talking about the show before us here in New York City, oh god, do they stink,  I'll tell you why, maybe someone out there likes it, and I'm sorry, John, I'm probably 
[00:05:00]  insulting John Minnelli, he thought, you know, he thinks they're terrific, I heard a garbage  truck driver this morning that enjoyed the program, that said he liked it, but also suggested  that two gentlemen that host it were gay, so I don't know if that's a good thing, it's  two guys out of LA, and they're just nice about everything, I mean, overly, everything,  overly nice, and making sure they don't offend anyone, very apologetic for everything, too, 
[00:05:30]  if this is the direction radio's going, we are doomed, like one guy apologizes for the  other, like one guy will say something, and then the other guy's like, oh, well, you shouldn't  say that, you know, be nice, that's not, that's, I want to, you know, I'm sorry to anybody that  was offended by the, what, what, like they played a sound clip this morning that was supposed  to mean one thing, but could have been interpreted as goofing on the garbage truck driver that 
[00:06:00]  said he enjoyed the show, and they immediately went like, sir, we just want you to know that  wasn't directed at you, that was, you know, we're trying to show this other, what, just  tell the garbage truck driver to shut up, stick his head under that big blade that crushes  the garbage, and die.  We're just a little different.  Yeah.  We're just a little different than the, uh.  I guess it's variety, Opie.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:06:30]  It's what they call the spice of life.  I get it.  I'd like to apologize.  I'm sure there's a bunch of people that listen to that show that hate us, whatever.  I want to apologize to Jeff, what, John and?  John and Jeff.  John and Jeff for Opie's, uh, little outrage here.  Opie, you shouldn't be so mean.  Every morning I gotta do what I gotta do in that bathroom behind you, Bob Kelly, and, uh,  and I have to, like, preface it with everybody in the office, like, oh, no, it's time to go  listen to John and Jeff, because that's the only place that I will listen to them, and that's 
[00:07:00]  because I don't know how to turn the volume.  You don't know how to turn the speaker off in the bathroom.  I don't know how to turn the speaker off in the bathroom, so I dread it every morning.  Does it help you, uh, with your business?  Sometimes I'm back so fast, you guys are like, what?  Yeah, he leaves the office, he comes back within a minute, and just throws, like, the  newspaper on the desk and goes, ugh.  Today I didn't even put my pants back together.  I just walked in with my belt off and my pants halfway down still.  Well, I don't even want to, like, you know, get myself together in the bathroom. 
[00:07:30]  I want to get out of that bathroom as soon as possible.  Oh, God!  What do they sound like?  It's, um...  Oh, they sound like two gay guys.  I mean, you know, I don't know.  I don't know what they're all about.  I don't want to know what they're all about, but, uh, when you listen, that's what I hear.  Very nice.  Just very sweet.  They're sweet boys.  They never gave their parents any guff growing up.  They give some advice.  Yeah.  They feel qualified to give people advice, and not even in a humorous way. 
[00:08:00]  I mean, just real, like, advice to people.  A woman who's calling up one day...  See, and I got to say, they're probably going, well, listen, obviously they know about our  show and they're listening.  Yes, there are some mornings I cannot turn that off.  It is like, how could you walk away from a, from flaming plane wreckage?  You couldn't.  You'd stand there and watch it.  I, uh, I'm looking at their website. 
[00:08:30]  They look like they, uh, should be in the Dateline house.  I'm Chris Hanson.  You're John and you're Jeff.  Sit down, have some cookies and lemonade.  You came here for sex with a minor.  All right, well...  You brought wine coolers and licorice whips.  The rest of the country has no clue what we're talking about.  Oh, I'm sure they've heard enough radio just like it. 
[00:09:00]  Let's just put it this way.  I'd rather drink two gallons of water.  Get a bad headache and go to sleep.  Without taking a wee.  All right, our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Today, it's, uh, it's the O&A virus spreading across America.  We got Bob Kelly in studio today.  Jim Norton's up there in Chicago.  He's going to be on Steve Dahl's show, uh, this afternoon on WCKG.  Yes.  So if you're in the Chicago area, please check out a little Jimmy Norton later on this afternoon.  What club is he playing in Chicago?  Uh, Zanies.  Oh, Zanies.  All of them. 
[00:09:30]  He's playing three different Zanies in three different days.  The Zanies tour.  No, that's what they make you do out in the Midwest.  You do.  They'll make you play every club because they want a good, they don't get good comics.  Yeah.  They just throw you at every club like one night.  They're going to play every club I own in my basement.  He's going to be here on Monday afternoon at four o'clock at Zanies in, uh.  That's pretty much what it sounded like.  Yeah.  He was just going to be there playing every place in Chicago.  All right, let's say hi to Seth in Miami.  Seth, what's up?  What's up, buddy? 
[00:10:00]  Hey.  Uh, is the show that perceives you?  All right, hold on a minute.  I'm getting, hold on, I'm getting some, uh, communique here that one of, uh, the guys  from, uh, John and Jeff, is that their name?  John, Jeff and John?  John and Jeff.  John and Jeff went to Thailand alone.  Hold on a minute, Seth.  Guilty.  Hold on a minute, Seth.  Guilty.  We have a whole theory on going to Thailand alone.  There's no reason to.  Unless you're Gary Glitter.  Gary Glitter.  Or that other guy that claimed to kill JonBenet Ramsey. 
[00:10:30]  We had a friend back in the day.  He would go to Vietnam with, uh, you know, by himself and then try to, you know, and he's  got pictures with little, little Thai girls.  I got to leave my post to see this.  Oh my God.  It's a mistake, man.  John, John parties all night with the ladies, uh, Pat Kong beach in, uh, Phuket in Thailand.  This girl could be 13 years old and he's got his arm around her little, nothing of a waist. 
[00:11:00]  She looks like that little girl that threw that pointy hat into the helicopter in Apocalypse Now.  Or the sniper in, uh, full metal jacket.  Shoot.  Me.  That's what Jon's into?  Going to Thailand?  He's into going to Thailand alone?  All right.  Guilty.  I'll go out on a limb here. 
[00:11:30]  Let's just say if you're going to Thailand.  Look, man, something's going on.  If you're going to Thailand alone.  Alone, you better actually, there's only, there's two reasons.  Okay.  One, you're a pedophile looking to, um, have sex with children, uh, with impunity.  Second, you're a buyer for rubber dog crap.  That's pretty much the only things you do in Thailand.  I want to make a deal.  I need 800,000 cases of rubber dog crap. 
[00:12:00]  Dude, he's at a hooker bar.  You see the other picture?  They're all like girls in the background waiting for a case.  This is the bar where they smoke out of places and shoot darts into balloons from straws.  And, and they're able to whistle at the same time.  Whistle a happy tune.  Terrible.  I never went to a place like that in Brazil with all my friends.  Well, Brazil's different.  You get women there.  Yeah.  Oh, you think those are men?  No, no, no.  I think they're kids.  Oh, kids.  You go to Thailand to have sex with kids. 
[00:12:30]  That's why people go alone.  Men go alone to Thailand.  They now, if you take too many trips to Thailand, this happened to a businessman here in the United States.  The, the, the, um, customs realized, hey, this guy's going to Thailand a lot by himself and going back and forth.  And, uh, finally it raised the red flag with customs.  They checked out his laptop that he had with him loaded with pictures, uh, of him and young kids and, uh, sexual activity. 
[00:13:00]  So, they, uh, they, uh, obviously arrested him.  Yeah.  There's a picture here.  You can see nothing but teenage girls all over the place.  I mean, you know, like, we're not, we're not complaining, but they, they look, in my opinion, that they're way underage.  Some of these girls.  Yeah.  There's stripper poles there.  There's stripper poles.  They're all wearing tank tops and tiny little shorts.  And everyone knows it's, it's for prostitution and for pedophiles.  It's, it's, that's what goes on.  It's known for it.  It's just known for it. 
[00:13:30]  That's it.  Does anybody have this guy's number?  You want to take a trip?  Oh, what the hell you got to come from?  And it's on his website?  That's a ballsy move.  Hey, go to this one.  The middle picture right there.  Yeah.  He has links to dum-dum lollipops.  Look at this.  These are all hookers, man.  That is not just a, just a girl out on a Friday night looking to have a little fun.  That is a hooker.  Now, this morning I did hear the caller that was on, the garbage truck driver, say that although the two guys sounded gay, 
[00:14:00]  he did hear one of them say once that he was into Asian girls.  Right.  Well, this is the one right here, John.  Yeah, apparently, literally, Asian girls, not women.  Wow.  All right.  I have a newfound respect for them.  All right.  We need to know more about John and Jeff.  You got to understand, though, doesn't he have like some religious lady in one photo and then just a bunch of whores in the other?  Well, you got to kind of mix it up a little just so it doesn't look so bad on the website. 
[00:14:30]  But he couldn't control himself and had to display his vice on the website.  Wow.  That's like, you know, if by night I chose a life of crime and would like to just, I liked holding up gas stations with shotguns and stocking over my head.  Yeah.  And then just put them on the website.  It's like, here's what I do after work.  Because I just can't help myself.  I rob gas stations.  I get off on this and I got to show the whole world.  You know, you wouldn't, you wouldn't be crime. 
[00:15:00]  You'd fight crime, Anthony.  I try.  You could do anything at night.  I try.  If I could ever leave my house, I would fight crime.  Let's go to Derek in Massachusetts.  Derek.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, if you think they're gay, listen on the radio.  I've happened to catch them for the intro and it's even worse.  And they're like, we're two guys that believe that if you're old enough to vote, you should drink.  It's gay.  All right.  All right.  It's kind of the obvious.  What's up, Iraq?  There's lines like, we're two guys who wonder where the service went in customer service. 
[00:15:30]  It's just these little, oh, I just got that.  You got shivers?  Oh, I just got some, I just got some douchey.  We are here to help the Vietnamese because inside every gook, there is an American trying to get out.  It's a hardball world, son.  We've got to try to keep our heads until this peace craze blows over.  What's that supposed to be?  Some kind of sick joke?  Don't you love your country?  Yes, sir.  How about getting with the program? 
[00:16:00]  Why don't you jump on the team and come on in for the big win?  Iraq's finding something over there.  What do you got, Iraq?  We're trying to find the promos.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I would like to hear one John and Jeff promo before we move on.  I love you, long time.  We, yeah, we'll talk about the MSNBC thing in a few minutes here.  It was just classic, classic.  He's so horny.  Classic ONA.  But we're trying to get a, you got one?  No, we're coming.  Oh, all right.  All right.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  We're getting one really fast here.  Can't wait.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Jersey.  What's up, Jeff?  Oh, boys.  I got two quick tidbits for you.  Yeah.  That Ramon and Frumpkis yesterday was absolutely classic.  Absolute classic.  You guys have reached new lows.  New lows.  All right.  Yeah.  If you don't know yet, we did a little interview on MSNBC and, yeah, it got a little silly.  It got a little silly. 
[00:17:00]  It got silly.  We're the poster boys for screwing up on the radio.  Well, you tell it.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  You tell it.  The great part was...  Shut up.  I want to apologize to that man who was leaving for Thailand early today.  I just want to leave with good vibes.  Let's say hi to John in Connecticut.  John, what's up?  Hey, how you doing over there?  Hey, man.  That show you're talking about is absolutely horrible.  They tell you that you shouldn't get married until you're 30. 
[00:17:30]  There's 50 rules you should have before you marry the girl.  It's awful.  I'll tell you something, though.  People seem to know what they're talking about.  Yeah.  See, this is one of those situations where it could be one of those shows...  Look, let me just tell you something.  ...where you got to listen because it's so bad.  It's not my cup of tea.  No.  All right?  No.  It's not my cup of tea.  It's the furthest from what we do on the radio.  Yeah.  Very safe discussions about everything. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  They actually talked about the hold your wee for a wee thing like we did yesterday and made it boring.  How do you make death audio boring?  I know.  How do you make death audio boring?  It kills a listener and, I don't know, it just didn't really hold my interest.  All right.  And they give advice.  It's like there's a woman called up about problems she was having with her husband.  And, I mean, it was really like it could have really been fun, a fun conversation because  apparently the guy she was married to was a real bastard and just treated her like crap. 
[00:18:30]  And she gave some examples.  And they were like, you have to get away from this man.  Just, Lee, it's time to move on.  Instead of like, well, what was it like when he'd like, you know, bring another chick home and punch you in the face?  You know, it was that kind of like wild stuff going on.  Fun we could have had.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, absolutely.  Let's go to Chad in Florida.  Chad, what's up?  What's going on, boys?  Hey, Chad.  Just wondering if you gentlemen happened to catch the O'Reilly last night and man douche. 
[00:19:00]  Of course, you gentlemen were brought up.  And they were calling, of all things, that show out there, shock chocks.  Yeah, we told everyone when this hold your wee for a wee thing, you know, broke that we would be dragged into this.  And I was getting ready to go to bed last night because I was exhausted.  So I decided to go, you know, crash early.  And I'm just about to turn off the remote.  And I have O'Reilly on.  And all of a sudden our faces are on his show. 
[00:19:30]  He's running B-roll about the hold your wee for a wee story.  What did we do?  They dragged us into it.  And then man douche was the, quote, expert.  And then he takes all sorts of shots at us.  So all he could do now is take shots at us from other people's television shows because he doesn't have a radio show in any city even worth mentioning.  I think he's down to, like, three shows in markets that you've never heard of. 
[00:20:00]  Well, he's calling himself the fastest growing radio show in America.  But the guy is getting thrown off the air in every major city and market that he's in.  He was bitching about our Chicago ratings.  Meanwhile, he's got thrown off the air.  He's not even on in Chicago anymore.  He doesn't have ratings.  So even if we have one listener in Chicago, it's one more than you have.  We're doing better than you.  That's the only way.  So he gets on a show and feels, ah, I'm so angry. 
[00:20:30]  I got to just lunge out at these people.  Instead of talking about what O'Reilly wanted to talk about, he had to, like, take his shots at us.  It's pathetic.  He's turned into a do-gooder.  He used to do shock radio.  Yeah.  But now he wants everyone to forget that he actually did really, really lame shock jock stuff over the years.  Yeah, he thinks he's a political commentary show.  So now he's going to be the do-gooder and talk about other shock jocks and how awful they are?  You were in the genre, you ass.  He's such a Hannity wannabe, and he couldn't wipe Hannity. 
[00:21:00]  He couldn't shine his shoes.  The guy is just a hack.  He's an old shock jock who just couldn't adapt to a changing world.  So he decided he was going to try to overnight change his image.  What happened to your sidekick, Turd, sending him out on wacky stunts?  Oh, just that hack shock stuff, too.  Not even just natural. 
[00:21:30]  Hey, Turd, Turd, we're going to give you a suit with a lot of blood on it.  We want you to go to a Chinese laundromat.  You're a laundromat, make-believe you were in the middle of a murder, and you've got to clean up your clothes fast because the authorities are on to you.  Set up fake stuff with actors and just phoniness.  And meanwhile, call us what you want if you want to call us shock jocks or anything.  But a lot of everything we did that was this shocking stuff, it was just things that we put in place that kind of took their natural course and were dubbed shocking. 
[00:22:00]  You know, we didn't expect a lot of the stuff to happen when we rolled out some shocking bit.  It just took its natural course.  It wasn't this scripted phoniness that this jackass man-douche did all the time.  And then, you know, that collapses.  That whole thing collapses, shock radio in general.  And he decides he's going to be like a Christian, and he's going to be the new Sean Hannity.  The new Hannity is going to talk about politics, and people are going to want to listen. 
[00:22:30]  No one wants to listen to his drivel.  Not even his hometown station.  His ratings were, you know, going in the toilet, and they got rid of him.  They got rid of him.  They got rid of him in Chicago, his hometown.  And we heard.  Yes.  Who's the biggest in Chicago?  We heard why, too.  He wasn't the biggest in Chicago when they got rid of him.  He was nowhere near the biggest in Chicago when they got rid of him.  We heard why.  Why?  Apparently, from everything I heard from people in Chicago, and we hear from a lot of people in Chicago, 
[00:23:00]  a lot of big company bigwigs from different companies, and he is very difficult to work with.  He's an ass.  The guy's a jackass.  A self-important, pompous fool.  And he won't listen to anyone around him.  Hey, all right, listen.  And that leaves him in a position where he's got to go on other people's talk shows, and  that's the only time he gets to take his shots, because he's not on the radio anywhere that 
[00:23:30]  matters.  So he's on the radio, but he doesn't on other people's talk shows.  He still does a radio show from his hometown of Chicago, but he's not heard in his hometown  of Chicago.  I know he's not from Chicago originally, but he made his name in Chicago, and he does a  show for tiny little cities that you barely can pronounce their names, even though they're  in America.  Those type of places.  He's not in Philadelphia.  He's not in Washington.  He's not in Boston or New York or Vegas. 
[00:24:00]  Name a city you know in, like, South Dakota.  Honolulu.  A city you know in South Dakota.  He's not in one of those.  He's in places like Duluth.  Duluth.  Duluth.  Duluth.  Duluth.  Not even sure if it's Duluth.  And that's, like, one of his major markets.  I'm talking places you never heard of, so we can't even say them.  I don't know.  I don't know them because I've never heard of them.  Right.  So it sounds like he's a bit jealous.  Yeah.  He's a bit jealous.  So we got the audio from O'Reilly.  And he's got his big radio voice on when he does this. 
[00:24:30]  Does he talk like this, nice, big, and fast?  And then when you hear him talk regular, it's just regular speech.  And he talks like that because if you really listen closely to what he has to say, he's  not really saying anything.  You put the big voice on.  I guess it's supposed to mean something.  I guess it gives some credibility to what you're saying.  What a pompous fool, too. 
[00:25:00]  On one of his websites, I guess, there's a big map of the United States to try to find  where he is.  And if you scroll over it, nothing comes up.  And, like, it's pick and choose a state.  And then you hit a state like, you know, Wyoming.  And it'll light up.  And it'll give a market in that state.  So you can't even.  There you go.  He's in.  This is exactly what I'm telling you.  He's in markets.  You don't really know how to pronounce the town names. 
[00:25:30]  Missoula.  Missoula.  Not Missouri.  It's Missoula.  He's in Missoula.  Anyway, we got his audio from Bill O'Reilly.  We got us on MSNBC, which is just a scream.  We'll explain that whole thing after the break.  Okay, Ant?  All right.  We got Bob Kelly here for Jim Norton.  We got Kevin Smith doing the whole show with us today.  Nice.  I think he's coming in around 7.  Oh, now a little later than 7?  Okay.  Kevin Smith sometime in the 7 o'clock hour. 
[00:26:00]  And our pal Bob Saget calling in a few minutes as well.  We got a very, very busy show.  We'll start with the MSNBC audio after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming this weekend to the Saturday Night Virus, it's the Voss and Bonnie Show. 
[00:26:30]  Three hours of America's funniest comedian and her husband, Rich Voss.  Saturday night from 9 p.m. to midnight on XM 202, The Virus.  Opie and Anthony!  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  We want to get to the audio of us on MSNBC.  And then Bill O'Reilly and Man Cow dragging us into the Hold Your Wee for Wee story last night on the Fox News channel.  Because we had, you know, a couple of slip-ups in our career. 
[00:27:00]  We want to play some John and Jeff promos because they're just terrific.  But first, we've got to say hi to Bob Saget.  He's at an airport somewhere.  Hey, Bob, what's going on?  I'm in search of my grandmother's anus.  I'm here in Atlanta right now.  Why would it be there?  You know, there's Stone Mountain.  It was gigantic, aren't it?  So I'm looking on top of Stone Mountain.  Well, why are you in Atlanta?  Doing comedy?  No, I'm trying to get to you.  I'm actually flying overnight because I had to get to Philly and my flight tomorrow got all screwed up. 
[00:27:30]  So I'm at the Tower Theater tonight, so I'm like the Blues Brothers.  I got a mission from God.  Wait, you couldn't get a direct flight from L.A. to Philly?  I should have had sex with a guy with a private jet.  I screwed up.  Fortunately, a lot of people are looking at me yelling, thinking something's wrong with me,  which I don't really care because I'm going to mount them.  Wait a minute.  Now I'm starting to think you took a red eye from L.A. to Atlanta and now Atlanta to Philly, right?  Yeah.  You're a big TV star. 
[00:28:00]  Why are you doing that?  Because I screwed up.  They screwed up my flight for tomorrow or this morning.  They got all screwed up.  You should yell at me.  It's dumb.  You don't have access to the private jet?  I could have bought one last night.  Yeah, why didn't you just buy one, really?  I should have literally just bought one.  Bob Saget could go to the Gulfstream store.  Can I have one of those?  I'm thinking at this point Bob Saget doesn't have to fly commercial.  And just got the real Hooters girls.  Sorry, my slip-up.  Yeah, really?  Oops.  Yeah, the Tooter Hoops and gone through their hoops and just put them into the plane and 
[00:28:30]  drank bloodies right out of them.  I was on a flight once with Bob.  Yeah, we had fun.  Yeah, it was the male flight attendant was harassing Bob the whole time.  It was all male airlines, wasn't it?  Yes, all male airlines.  Hi, you're Bob Saget.  Oh.  You know what that rhymes with.  Let me put this in the overhead.  Yeah.  Don't recline. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, he's putting stuff in Bob's overhead compartment and he's got his junk in Bob's  face.  Wait, I just noticed a sound.  Are you calling from a pay phone?  I'm calling from my cell phone.  I'm envisioning our last flight, thinking about this health flight I'm about to take.  I'll probably have the John Lithgow gargoyle from Twilight Zone.  Are you flying on ATA?  No, I'm flying on Delta.  Maybe I'll give the flight number at some of your...  Yeah, people can meet you when you get a... 
[00:29:30]  Your Looney Tune listeners can target me.  He is just the most recognizable guy, too, and he's a tall guy, so...  Yeah.  And we walked to the baggage carousel, you know, got off the plane, and everyone in the  airport just looks at him, gawks, and knows who the guy is.  It's got to be the biggest pain in the ass to be Bob Saget.  It's like Big Bird with testicles.  He walks through the airport, everyone just...  Hey, look, it's Bob Saget.  Hey, I wouldn't be having this gig if it wasn't for you, because your virus tore my stand-up  in addition to wherever the hell I was in my career, so I would just do whatever it 
[00:30:00]  did, and now...  Well, I think...  We had to add, like, 600 seats to the tower tonight.  Yeah, we had a lot of fun with Bob Saget this past summer on the ONA Traveling Virus.  We're getting ready to do it again, Bob.  I'll come when you guys come, and I mean that territorially.  In the corner of a wall.  I mean, if it's a small medicine bottle, a beanbag chair, your grandmother's wig, I don't  care.  I'll come where you guys come.  Yeah.  Hey, uh...  We were just talking about One Versus 100 the other day. 
[00:30:30]  Why is that show on Friday nights?  That show should be moved.  We should do something.  Of course it should be moved.  It's a great, great show.  I watch it every week.  Two weeks ago, they moved it, and it was number five for the week, so we know something's  right.  I'm sorry, they're firing a missile into my anus right now.  Another dump.  By the way, I did the comedy festival, that thing, and they did two shows, and they were  both filthy, and Jim North did the second show, and he just kicked ass.  He was so funny. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, Jimmy does pretty good for himself.  I don't like when he talks about women in snowsuits and what he likes to see.  Yeah, I would imagine Bob Saget would like that, of course.  Well, everyone thinks he's the family guy, Bob Saget, but no, the reality is he's a dirty,  dirty boy, Bob.  No, I got kids.  You know, we just don't mix with their friends.  Yeah.  Hey, the Olsen...  There are laws against...  The Olsen twins are worth $100 million.  Just came out yesterday.  I think that's just actually their liquid body weight. 
[00:31:30]  You could actually...  What's the body worth on most people?  A couple hundred bucks?  I think they'd be worth a lot in Thailand, places like that.  If somebody's a celebrity, I don't think it applies to the...  There's $1.98 worth of water in your body.  If you're famous, I think someone would pay a million dollars just to have your dead body  at home.  Are you advocating the killing and then taking of the bodies of the Olsen twins? 
[00:32:00]  Never.  Never, never, never.  Very good.  Good.  I'm saying necrophilia is not a bad way to go.  You got to chill a little bit, man.  You're a big TV star again.  Yeah, it's interesting.  And I got the thing, the Penguin movie, which is...  It'll be a big DVD.  Oh, yeah.  DVD coming out January 30th.  Yeah, I'm excited about it.  We got a lot of subversive stuff on the DVD that you're not allowed to rate.  Oh, really?  What's the name of the movie again that's coming out?  Farce, F-A-R-C, Farce of the Penguins. 
[00:32:30]  Right, right, right.  Hey, did you have a good movie on the flight?  I started to watch The Departed and then I decided that it wasn't the right tone.  The right tone?  I put on some Sleep With This Music.  And Delta's got these little things where you can listen to any kind of fruity music you want.  So I listen to music that takes me into the next life.  So you can sleep on an all-night flight?  I can.  I had the guy next to me, I had him inject me with this chemical. 
[00:33:00]  That's who?  In my neck.  Sounds sexy.  I didn't mean it that way.  I took out the center divider and let him just take his way with me.  And I knocked out of shame.  You ever get scared of flying?  I mean, you've flown so many times over the years.  Are you scared at all, ever?  I think I'm scared of a private jet now and then.  And I'm always scared if there's other famous people on the flight.  Because then you list who would be there first.  And then there's paper.  You'd be pretty high up. 
[00:33:30]  Well, you know, it depends on where you're at that month in your career.  You know, I had one flight.  I had David Bowie and Amon.  Mark McEwen, who used to do the weather when I was doing the sidekick on CBS.  Big of them.  Greg Kinnear and Richard Lewis.  All on one flight?  Yeah.  And the engine had a problem.  So they made us go into the lounge.  It looked like a Hirschfield painting.  And then I said something like, engine number three had the Ebola virus.  And then Richard Lewis yells out, good one, Bob. 
[00:34:00]  Amon is from Zaire.  Insulting people.  And it's all very verbal and very loud.  I didn't know.  I didn't know anything back then.  I was a child.  Insulting people as you might be plummeting to your death.  It's not good.  Everybody becomes a very nice, politically correct person when you get on that plane.  You don't want to go on with bad karma.  No, you don't want to pull the anger card and yell where people are really from, all that stuff.  Not at all.  All right.  I'm in the studio. 
[00:34:30]  I'm sitting in there now.  I actually got on the plane.  I'm getting looks from a lot of people.  Yeah, they parade the steerage people past Bob to get a look.  Move along now.  Move along.  Now, I'm in studio with you guys at 31st, so I'll be in the building finally.  Oh, that'll be very cool.  It's been a while.  Why don't you just yell at these people walking by, don't stare at me.  I kind of, I feel bad because I've got my chest, my chesticles outside my pants.  Giving them the brain? 
[00:35:00]  When I tell them, it's out of my pocket.  It has to air.  It's like three feet.  What is it?  What is it?  It's a pinky in the brain.  Give me cell phone pictures of Bob's brain.  All right, Bob.  Fruit hanging out.  Yeah.  Hey, Bob, for Philly, the big plug.  Let's go.  It's Tower Theater at night.  I think it's almost sold out.  They put in like an extra 600 seats.  I don't know.  I hope there's a stage.  Oh, that's very cool.  Yeah, it's really cool.  I really thank you guys. 
[00:35:30]  You guys are always supportive, and you're always honest, too, which I like.  Well, thank WYSP, too, man.  They're big supporters of the show.  And Bob Saget.  Yeah, you're strong.  Oh, boy.  There's the announcements.  She's hot, man.  I'd like to remind you why you're getting to see her.  Oh, tell her, shut up.  I'm going to use my phone during takeoff.  Listen to me.  You should see the rack on this thing.  When she asks for juice, I'm going to give her some. 
[00:36:00]  I'll give her a mimosa.  A mimosa sounds like you've been violating someone in another country, doesn't it?  You better hope this flight is uneventful, because I'd hate for this to be Bob Saget's last interview.  Why?  Imagine that.  The news has to carry and bleep it about.  You know what I want you to do for me is favor you guys.  Yeah.  As friends, I want you to put it on YouTube with flash animation of everything I said to you.  Yeah, man.  That'll be your tribute. 
[00:36:30]  Hey, Bob.  And we'll show my brain hanging out.  It'll be great.  Bob, we need your expert opinion.  Yeah.  Single guy going to Thailand.  Why is he going to Thailand?  And we need more than one answer.  He loves Bangkok.  Mm-hmm.  He loves the food.  Are you going there for the sights?  Okay.  Are you going there for the kids, if you know what I mean?  Are you going there for...  A happy ending.  Some people will fly anywhere. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  That's what...  Obviously.  It's Thailand.  There's nothing else going on there.  Wicker.  They got wicker.  Wicker.  You want to buy wicker.  You're a wicker salesman for a Pure One Imports, and you have to go check out what's new in wicker.  That's fine.  Or you want to have sex with young children.  You want to make a ceramic...  You want a ceramic elephant with its brain hanging out.  All right, Bob.  I like you more. 
[00:37:30]  Don't interrupt the flight.  Have a safe one.  Guys.  And we'll see you the 31st, I guess.  Yeah, 31st in studio, but tonight at the Tower Theater in Philly, right?  Thanks, guys.  I'll talk to you soon.  All right.  And one versus 100 tonight on NBC.  Thanks a lot.  I really appreciate it.  All right, cool.  I'm going to go talk to your fans.  I'm going to go take a dump in here.  He's got to fake like he's on the phone now, so no one interrupts him and bothers him.  He's done it so many times.  Talked into just a blank phone. 
[00:38:00]  Battery's been dead for weeks.  This is so embarrassing.  I'm on a cart like Hannibal Lecter with a golf ball in my mouth.  My kids love you.  And shut up, lady.  Take your seat in row 22.  Let me pull this hatchet out of your chest.  Oh, wait.  I just put it there.  Oh, darn.  Run it backwards.  All right.  We'll see you soon, Bob.  Thanks, guys.  I'll talk to you later.  All right.  Very cool.  Bob Saget, everyone.  Once again, Tower Theater tonight in Philadelphia.  You will not be disappointed. 
[00:38:30]  There's still some people out there that think they're going to get the nice Bob Saget on that stage.  Unless you go to see that, then you'll be very disappointed.  Those are the people that walk by him on the plane.  All the old ladies.  I saw it that day.  He was sitting right in front of me.  And everyone just stops.  My children adore you and your program.  It's wonderful.  And he's like, oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Big smile.  And then she passes by and he turns around and looks at me and drops the C-bomb.  A woman has no clue.  Bob Saget just called her the C. 
[00:39:00]  Bob Saget's a dirty boy on that stage.  All right.  Hey, you got some John Jeff promos?  Can't get enough of the John Jeff today.  Thank God.  If you're just tuning in, these are the guys that are on us before us here in New York City.  And they're a little too nice for my taste.  Yeah, they...  That's hilarious.  But there's one thing about, you know, being nice and another about avoiding entertainment if it comes across your transom. 
[00:39:30]  Like, they...  They don't want any controversy.  They had a conversation about a woman who was still living with her ex-husband in the same house.  Weird condition.  And one of the guys asked, well, what happens if you, you know, bring home a guy?  How does that work?  And the other one went, hey, hey, it's a bit of a personal question to be asking.  And, you know, if you're being sarcastic or something, it's kind of funny.  He was in all seriousness telling this guy, hey, this could get entertaining if we pursue this line of questioning. 
[00:40:00]  Please stop it immediately.  Well, we got a promo from their fine radio show.  A what?  A promo.  Oh, promo.  Promo.  Yes.  Due to the mature and graphic subject matter, viewer discretion is advised.  The John and Jeff Show.  The John and Jeff Show.  We're two guys who think poor people cannot afford to have kids.  We're two guys who wonder what happened to the service in customer service.  We're two guys who think shoplifters should be caged like animals in full view of customers. 
[00:40:30]  The John and Jeff Show.  Ugh.  Know what the difference is?  Our listeners are the shoplifters.  And they're the caged animals.  Do they think that's, like, good?  Cutesy?  What are they going for there?  Those guys are just nice.  Those are nice.  There's actually nice human beings in the world, Opie.  No.  These guys are just really nice guys trying to just be nice.  And, hey, that's a little personal.  And you guys are like, you scumbag.  Drag it out of our...  A little personal.  How about your pictures of you in Thailand with your arm around what appears to be a youngster? 
[00:41:00]  Oh, but maybe he's actually giving 35 cents a day to that little youngster.  Oh, you think you bought her?  Yeah, maybe he's actually through a Christianity program.  You can sponsor a child.  You can sponsor.  And have sex.  Yes.  For 35, for the price of a cup of coffee at Starbucks, you can have sex.  We have another one?  The John and Jeff Show.  The John and Jeff Show.  Where are you guys who think there should be a federal investigation into the long lines 
[00:41:30]  at the post office?  Where are you guys who think it should be a felony if your french fries are cold at the  drive-thru?  Where are you guys who think a woman should give a man a gift after getting engaged?  The John and Jeff Show.  The John and Jeff Show.  All right.  You've got to go CSI on them, yeah.  All right.  Are they...  All right.  It's all true.  Are they being serious or are they goofing?  I would love to say, because if they were goofing, this would be a great, like, bit. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, because if you twist it a little bit, that could be a nice goof promo.  But they're serious, right?  Yeah.  You think they sit around and go, where are two guys, hmm?  Let's play up the two-guy angle.  Where are two guys?  We're two guys.  And it's got to be relatable.  Like, what do people not like to do?  Hang out on lines at the post office.  Where are two guys?  Oh, guys.  Okay, post office, long lines.  Where are two guys that...  Where are two guys that like to open the door?  Long lines at the post office, they should investigate that. 
[00:42:30]  Right.  All right.  If I hold the door, you should say thank you.  Good.  Good.  A lot of people hold the door and don't get a thank you.  Oh, yes.  That's it.  Where are two guys?  Where are two guys that will give you the courtesy of a reach-around?  Hello, exactly!  Oh, my God.  These guys look exactly the same, too.  Yeah.  They look like twins.  They're generic.  Well, I'm sure the listeners will have some where are two guys ideas for them for their next promo. 
[00:43:00]  Just to show you the difference in the two shows.  Right.  Hey, maybe we can...  Here it comes.  Maybe we can play up the two guys.  Steve, throw together a couple of two...  We're two guys promos.  Yeah, could you?  Where's Steve?  Yeah, Steve will throw together an Opie and Anthony version of the two guys promo.  Steve, just use your normal psychopathic mind.  We're two guys.  Full of woman abuse and beatings.  We're two guys that have no problem jumping on a homeless man's cake and then openly laugh at them. 
[00:43:30]  We're two guys that take a wiffle ball bat.  All right.  Yeah, well...  What's Steve?  You mean just do the normal?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Run-of-the-mill normal Steve stuff.  Done.  Done to the we're two guys thing.  We're blatantly ripping off John and Jeff.  Do we have another example?  Okay.  We're two guys who think women who keep their maiden names in marriage are high maintenance. 
[00:44:00]  We're two guys who think DNA tests should be mandatory before a man's name goes on a birth certificate.  We're two guys who think nobody should get married before the age of 30.  We're two guys who think nobody should get married before the age of 30.  Look, I don't know if they're goofing or if they're serious.  I know.  I know.  They're serious.  Dude, your normal reflex, it's like reaching into a fire.  Your normal reflex is to pull away.  See, that's what you're doing.  Your normal reflex is to think this cannot possibly be serious. 
[00:44:30]  But please...  It is serious, right?  Yes.  It is serious.  These guys are absolutely serious.  I don't like the way he said maintenance.  Yes.  Maintenance.  I really want...  Maintenance.  Let's go to Nico and D.  Our high maintenance.  Maintenance.  Maintenance.  Maintenance.  Maintenance.  Maintenance.  How about we're two guys who think that Ike shouldn't have been so easy on Tina. 
[00:45:00]  There you go.  That's our two guys.  That's it.  Very good.  Wow.  You got another one?  Two guys that like an occasional sprinkle of sugar on our oatmeal.  Whoa.  They are wild.  That's so funny.  Getting those frequent flyer miles to some Southeast Asian crap hole.  We're two guys that don't use sweetener and not coffee. 
[00:45:30]  Bob is right in the way.  Wild.  They're just two nice guys trying to carve their own place in radio.  Yeah.  We got to bash them.  Of course we have to.  Why?  One trying to make enough money to go to Thailand three times a year.  Right.  To have sex with 13 year olds.  Well, we don't know.  You guys are trying to.  You guys are party poopers is what you are.  I know.  Listen to us.  You know how much money it costs to go to Thailand?  I mean, granted, the women are cheap.  Yeah.  Once you get there.  You can go there and get a woman for like a box of Uncle Ben's. 
[00:46:00]  Officially, we have no idea why he goes to Thailand.  Right, Bob Kelly?  Yeah.  He goes there because of the kids.  There are plenty of reasons.  But Anthony during the break was talking about, you know, just imagine the plane ride to the flight to Thailand.  You just can't wait.  You're just dying on that plane.  You have all your overheads already in your lap ready to go.  You're not taking anything.  You didn't even pack like a check-in. 
[00:46:30]  Everything's carry-on so you can fly right to the little rickshaw.  And two hours into the flight, it's on your lap.  And the steward has to say, hey, look, man, we got 12 hours to go.  You might want to relax.  I can't relax.  You go into the bathroom and just get into shorts and flip-flops.  So you just get right in that rickshaw, fly to the little house of dragons, whatever they call it.  Yeah, whatever it's called.  The house of Hua.  I actually went to one in San Francisco, like a little tiny geisha place like that. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  There's a big wooden dragon door.  Of course there is.  You knock on it and you hear all these little women giggling.  They open it and it's like gong.  And there's around 35 Asian women behind the door.  And you get to pick all of them.  And there's one – like at the end, there's like one hot white chick.  Really?  Just a smoking white chick.  So you're kind of scanning and they're all like perking up.  And then you get to the white chick, you're like her.  And they go –  They all get pissed because the white chick gets picked all the time. 
[00:47:30]  I knew it.  White chick always gets bobby.  Now we have to go back to cook fish.  We're two guys that hate when **** cut us off in traffic.  Let's go to Bob in Connecticut.  Bob.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I wanted to say, how about this one for the Judge F guy?  We're two guys that think kissing girls is gross.  Hey, what's up, guys?  That could be the next one.  We're two guys that still believe you can get cooties from girls. 
[00:48:00]  Let's go to Scam.  Scam, what's up?  What up, boys?  Hey.  We're two guys that think Nicole Brown Simpson deserved it.  Ooh.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to Justin on Long Island.  Justin, what's up?  What's up, boys?  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey, we're two guys that think it's not gay if you don't push back.  Let's go to Redding from Whack Bag.  Redding.  Hey, it's Scott and Jeff with you.  Hey.  Hey, you know, it's – 
[00:48:30]  Shit.  I punched it out.  Oh, wow.  Oh, did he choke.  Wow.  And he swore.  He was all eager and –  He was so excited to be on the air.  He was going to contribute.  He forgot the whole we're two guys, like, concept.  And then his brain went blank.  You know, because he was rehearsing the character too much.  Yeah.  Right.  Honey, but what about this, honey?  We're two –  No, it's too much.  I'll do that.  We're Donald Jeff. 
[00:49:00]  And then –  Wait, what's the bit?  Oh, damn.  I got excited.  He was a good one.  Yeah.  Let's go to Peter in the Bronx.  Peter.  Yeah, what's up, buddy?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  We're two guys that'll drink as much water as we want to.  We need one good one before we go to break.  Jeff in Florida.  Jeff.  Hey, you can come through and say we're actually a couple of guys that thought Hitler had some good ideas.  All right.  Well, yeah. 
[00:49:30]  And, Brad, what's up?  How about we're two guys that eat our handheld after we break our knee, man?  All right.  Well.  We get to Bob Kelly audio.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand, man.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  You know what the worst part about that? 
[00:50:00]  You want to eat me?  You want to eat me?  Oops.  My finger hit the wrong button.  Let's go to Matt in Ohio.  Matt, what's up?  We're two guys that think puberty is overrated.  Punch it out, guys.  Let's go to Lead Belly.  Lead Belly.  Hey, freehomfans.com, guys.  All right.  Where are two guys that laughed at Andrew A.H.?  I'm not, like, going to crash and more laugh or nothing. 
[00:50:30]  I guess we'll have to take a break now.  Yeah.  We're having fun with that.  Well, that's fun.  Oh, well.  That was fun.  The two guys concept.  Could have done it all morning until I last called.  I'll tell you, though, none are better than the actual ones.  Regroup and do something else after the break.  What?  None better than the real ones.  Yeah.  You got one more real one?  All right.  Here's Z-Rock. 
[00:51:00]  Rocking your radio live.  All night long, party people.  It is the John and Jeff Show.  Third shift.  Free for all.  And we're two guys who aren't afraid to read our e-mails live on the air.  And if you have an e-mail from the John and Jeff Show, go to our website.  It's johnjeff.com.  J-O-H-E-F-S-E-F-S-O-T-O-T-O-T-O-M.  Well, hey, they said it.  That's all.  You will be now.  They said it, not me.  Oh, boy.  You need to change that promo.  I am definitely too scared to read my e-mail on the air. 
[00:51:30]  You dummies.  We're afraid, and supposedly these people like us.  Let's go to Chad in Indiana.  Chad, what's up?  We're two guys who like to bomb frat houses with marshmallows.  All right.  Ah, a little callback.  Don't be fraternity hazing days.  You know, this isn't fun anymore.  Kevin Smith joined the program in a little bit.  Steve writing some kind of note.  It's got to be important.  Oh, okay. 
[00:52:00]  No.  When we get back, the MSNBC audio from yesterday, we'll have to explain to the new listeners  why.  I think we might have to actually explain why this is so funny to some people out there.  All right.  Because it's a lot of inside stuff.  Yeah, inside jokes.  And then we'll get into Bill O'Reilly dragging us into that dumb hold your wee for a wee story.  We knew it would happen, and it happened officially last night.  Stupid Bill O'Reilly.  And then stupid Mad Cow deciding to take shots at us out of nowhere, even though the story's  not about us.  It's because he doesn't have a radio show in any city to take shots at us from, so he's 
[00:52:30]  got to do it from other people's shows.  Okay, we're going to definitely do this next, which means don't answer the celebrity phone.  Lock the door so Tom doesn't have to come in with some...  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, good morning.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  On this TGIF.  Oh, that's right. 
[00:53:00]  All right.  So, MSNBC called us at the end of our XM show yesterday.  They wanted some comments.  They wanted to ask us some questions and get some answers from us about this incident that  happened in Sacramento.  We for a wee.  Everyone knows the story by now, right?  Yeah, of course.  We played the death audio yesterday.  And I was creeped out.  Yeah, it was a little creepy.  The girl, you know, we had audio of her just having a good time at some kind of morning 
[00:53:30]  zoo type radio show.  Just trying to win a wee for her kids.  And it was kind of fun to listen to the audio.  She was having a good time with it.  The hosts were being, like, morning zoo-ish.  Wacky.  Never thought that it would just turn horrific for them.  Yeah.  And then later on, we played the audio of her having some obvious problems.  Yeah, she had pain in her head.  Yeah, and then it's creepy.  And it's also creepy to know that a mere hours later, she was dead.  She died from drinking too much water. 
[00:54:00]  Two gallons of water without taking a leak.  And she didn't even win the wee.  No.  Came in second place.  She won Justin Timberlake tickets.  And as Opie commented yesterday, there were just two conspicuously empty seats at the  Justin Timberlake concert.  But Opie goes, yeah, but she didn't even win the contest.  She died for naught.  For nothing.  Kids.  So MSNBC calls us and says, hey, could you come on with Alison Stewart? 
[00:54:30]  She's doing a whole thing on this hold your wee for a wee.  And you guys are experts in the shock jock genre.  In the field of shock jockery.  So we need to talk to you dopes.  So then Ant and I got together.  As far as shock jockification goes, can they think of another word for it, please?  Anthony and I got together and decided we're going to just freaking try to get as many ridiculous 
[00:55:00]  inside show references on the show as possible.  Because let's face it, MSNBC, not the most viewed channel on your cable or satellite platform.  So I didn't really care about getting my point across as far as this issue goes on a channel.  And probably a program that doesn't have that many viewers.  I'm just being honest.  I'm not trying to be mean.  It's MSNBC at noon. 
[00:55:30]  The girl's actually from MTV.  Yeah.  She's actually a nice enough girl.  We've had a relationship with her over the years.  Yeah.  She's all right.  Alison Stewart.  She does a pretty good job with her gig at MSNBC.  She was very excited to have us.  I guess in her world, it was a big get.  Oh, Jesus.  You guys are the – I mean, statistically, for what people have been kicked off the air  for, I think you guys are at the top of the list.  We kind of fit as the get guests.  St. Pat's and then dying from water. 
[00:56:00]  Well, I think we're in second.  I mean, we've never killed anybody.  We've got to kill the listeners.  We've had a lot of people arrested and blah, blah, blah.  But we've never killed anyone that we know of.  Alison Stewart, nice enough girl and everything like that.  But to tell you the truth, we do a show where we have to kind of be up to date on the news  and news programming and things like that.  And I hadn't heard of the program.  So it kind of – I know a lot of news programs.  Never kind of heard of it before.  And it seems like it was some kind of schizophrenic news. 
[00:56:30]  And then they throw in like where the extreme weather is in the country.  And then they do like a WebJunk 20 thing where they show videos from the web.  And then an interview with somebody.  And then a little more news.  And then it was all over the place.  It was really short attention span, bam, bam, bam kind of thing.  So, yeah, we decided, hey, let's just have some fun with it  and throw in as many inside references to this program as possible.  Right.  Really fast. 
[00:57:00]  We've got to say hi to Ron in Astoria.  I thought we were in lockdown.  Oh, yeah.  How did he get in?  It was a big speech, Opie.  We were in lockdown.  I can't help myself.  Ron, what's up?  Yeah, this is Nick from Whitestone.  Tell your screener I got through.  You guys suck.  Howard Stern rules.  All right.  Anything else, Ron?  That's it.  Okay.  Opie or Anthony.  What?  No, you know exactly who –  It's both of us.  You know exactly who's who there, buddy.  So do you have – why are you listening to us instead of listening to him?  Tell your screener I got through.  He sucks.  Why – why – 
[00:57:30]  Howard Stern rules.  Bye.  But why are you listening to us instead of him?  Dog house.  Wait.  No.  Why are you listening to us instead of Howard?  That's a very good question.  I'm listening to you.  Huh?  Instead of just like blurting stuff out, which is cool.  Fine.  You're a fan of whatever show.  Why don't you just talk and say – answer this.  Why are you listening to us?  I am talking.  Suck it easy.  See, they don't have anything.  They don't have anything past the old plug. 
[00:58:00]  If I was to make a call like that, I would engage the guy in conversation to try to make  him look silly, trip him up or something.  But then you stop and actually say, all right, look, the show is yours.  Go ahead.  Say something.  Go ahead.  Howard Stern rules.  All right.  I'll tell you a screener.  He stinks.  All right.  By the way, we know our screener stinks.  We get these calls every Friday, but we're not getting them as much as we used to.  And that's because Howie doesn't work on Friday.  Friday's day off day.  Doesn't work on Fridays and takes about, I think it's up to 12 weeks a year off. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  All right.  He still rules in your eyes.  Terrific.  No one's talking about him now.  So, yeah.  So we did the show references.  Yeah.  So Allison Stewart, you know, she's doing the story.  I decide to give the blah, blah, blah, who cares answers.  And then Anthony just shined.  And I was trying to fit in as many show references as possible.  Yeah.  And they made no sense to anybody who didn't know the show. 
[00:59:00]  So I came off sounding like a complete lunatic.  You know what?  All I wanted to do was make our listeners laugh.  You know what's going to help this for the new listeners?  Anthony does Steve's bad acting lines.  Yeah.  How did your parents die?  Right.  Okay.  You're going to hear that in here.  What else?  Did you talk to your doctor?  Yeah.  That one was the one that confused a lot of people.  That's an old school reference.  We used to have an advertiser, Stack or Two. 
[00:59:30]  Actually, they're back with us.  Yeah.  We haven't talked about them in a couple months, but they're advertising with the Opie and Anthony  show.  And there was an old commercial that Psycho Mark did where it starts off, did you talk to  your doctor about Stack or Two?  Yeah.  Did you talk to your doctor?  He put on his radio voice and took off his Psycho Mark voice.  Right.  At the end of the call ends with this.  I've got Allison.  Allison.  Because it was Allison Stewart.  Yeah.  So I did a little Howie there. 
[01:00:00]  A little Howie.  With the Allison thing.  Where's the Steve lines?  Did you find them?  Did you find them really fast?  Because for the new listeners, then this will make a little more sense.  Yeah.  The old school people thought, yeah, right on.  I see a no, no, no, no.  Do we have any of the bad acting lines from Steve?  Oh, here it is.  Okay.  Got it.  Got it.  This is Steve doing his acting.  His horrible acting.  How'd your parents die?  Listen to how it sounds the same as this.  Like, that's a pretty serious thing. 
[01:00:30]  Asking someone how their parents died.  And just a throwaway why not.  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  He's so dynamic in his delivery.  And then there's, what was the other one?  How'd your parents die?  That's the one I just said.  I don't know.  There was another.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, God.  All right.  He just says, you know, that's terrible.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Before the How'd Your Parents die.  It's just one of Steve's acting lines. 
[01:01:00]  It is like a strong Columbo.  I don't need to go into it.  So answering by using some of the classic Steve acting lines from our show.  I hear this.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  All right.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  So these are some of the references you're going to hear in the interview.  And then.  But Caruso laughs at you.  And then the big the big thing.  Well, you know, it'll be obvious for everyone how silly it is.  But here we go.  The Sacramento County Sheriff's Department has opened a criminal investigation into the death of a California woman who drank too much water.  Jennifer Strange drank as much as two gallons of water during a radio show stunt to win a popular gaming station system. 
[01:01:30]  Excuse me.  The sheriff is considering filing charges after hearing part of the radio show broadcast.  How much water do you think you can drink before you have to wee?  I do like two gallons.  Two gallons?  Oh, dude.  Can't you get water poisoning and like die?  No water.  Your body is 98% water.  Why can't you take in as much water as you want?  I don't know.  Maybe we should have researched this.  I don't know.  I mean, yeah. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  98% water.  Isn't that what they did to that guy in X-Men?  Yeah.  Like that's 98% water turned into jelly.  They were just trying to have a little fun with their, like, you know, morning zoo type program.  Yeah.  I had no clue it was going to end how it did.  That is a little, I mean.  They didn't even think there was even a chance that someone would get close to dying from just drinking water.  That is a weird thing, though, to think that somebody could die from drinking water.  You're drinking, you know, dehydrating, being in a ship. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, or booze or something like that.  Alcohol during a hazing or something.  Yeah, the water thing happens every once in a while, usually to a frat guy, because, you know, it's, like Anne said, a hazing thing.  Drink all this water without taking a leak.  Marshmallows.  All right.  Here's where we get to jump on the program yesterday afternoon.  Yeah.  Maybe you should have researched that more.  Shortly after.  Speaking of maybe you should have researched that more.  Yeah, maybe you should have listened to.  Here comes Opie and Anthony.  To how we were planning this on the air yesterday.  Right.  Before we even interviewed, we were plotting this on the air. 
[01:03:00]  Like, trying to come up with what to say and what words to get in.  I don't know.  I mean, yeah.  Maybe you should have researched that more.  Get to the experts.  After that part of the conversation on January 12th, a nurse called in warning of the dangers of drinking too much water.  The radio station has now fired ten employees, including three of the morning show disc jockeys.  Opie and Anthony are nationally syndicated radio hosts, also on XM Satellite Radio, two of the best known in the business.  They're joining us now on the phone.  Guys, thank you so much for joining us today.  Thanks for having us, Allison. 
[01:03:30]  Hey, Opie, so as two people who do provocative radio for a living, what did you think when you first heard this story about this woman dying from drinking that much water during this stunt?  Well, obviously, I feel bad for Jennifer and her family, but I also feel bad for the show because they're just kind of a wacky morning show.  They're not really shock jocks or edgy.  They were just kind of having a little fun, and it blew up kind of pretty fun.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I feel bad.  Anthony, what did you think when you first heard this? 
[01:04:00]  It was awful.  You know, these poor kids of the mother are going to be asked for the rest of their life, you know, how would your parents die, you know, or your parents die, and they're going to have to come up with this ridiculous story of, you know, a radio stunt.  So, Opie, so what at this point in the story, if anything, points to the radio host's responsibility for this woman's death or absolves them from it?  That's a good question.  It's going to be tough to get out of this one. 
[01:04:30]  You really don't sign up to kill a listener when you do a radio show.  So, I'd say they're pretty screwed.  Yeah, I was listening to you guys this morning, and one of the, you played a clip from this show, and one of the guys was like, hey, she signed a release.  Does that, she signed a release excuse hold, in your opinion?  No, I think legally it might hold, but, so they don't get arrested.  But I think civil, a civil case will be brought up, and it reminds me, it was a case years ago, back in 83, a couple of disc jockeys, I think it was Ramon and Frankis in the morning. 
[01:05:00]  They had a staff member who shoved marshmallows in his mouth, and he choked, wearing a bunny suit.  It was awful, tragic.  The Nagel family's never recovered from that, and, you know, I remember they were taken right off the air.  The Nagel family.  See?  Our own Iraq, his last name is Nagel.  Nagel. 
[01:05:30]  And Ramon is very famous in this Opie and Anthony show.  That's when Jimmy does his little phone gag.  One of my favorite things of the whole time.  And he just makes a noise.  Frankis!  And I said yesterday, before the show ended, I go, I'm really going to try to get the word Frankis into the interview.  And he's like, if you could do that.  I'm thinking, there's no way you could do that.  And then as far as, you know, shoving marshmallows in your face while wearing a bunny suit, E-Rock did that yesterday on our show. 
[01:06:00]  He was in a bunny suit shoving marshmallows in his mouth, seeing how many he could get in and still say chubby bunny.  And we had him choking in the bunny suit.  I got it.  And then right after that, she goes right back to me.  And I was, just to give you a little behind the scenes, I was in the middle of looking at houses yesterday in Manhattan.  I was in like an alleyway across from a school in a construction site.  Like, I am laughing so freaking hard.  I actually had to cover up the phone.  And then she asked me another question.  I have no idea what she asked me. 
[01:06:30]  And I'm like, I'm like, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm stammering and stuttering and trying to get back on track.  You could tell you were laughing.  And then, like, he couldn't get his train of thought together because he's still thinking, what an ass I am.  I got to hear that again.  It reminds me, it was a case years ago, back in 83, a couple of disc jockeys, I think it was Ramon and Frankis in the morning.  They had a staff member who shoved marshmallows in his mouth and he choked wearing a bunny suit. 
[01:07:00]  It was awful, tragic.  The Nagel families never recovered from that.  And, you know, I remember they were taken right off the air.  So, Opie, do you think this is going to bring any, any industry-wide changes?  Or is this just going to be one of these sad stories that sort of fades from the headlines eventually?  Uh, no, I think, uh, I think, I think.  I don't know what the question was.  I think I'm going to hang up now.  Did I say that?  And she's continuing? 
[01:07:30]  I thought that was the showstopper.  I thought, you know, well, thanks, guys.  Quickly get us off the phone.  She's asking, she's going back to you, though.  Yeah.  Oh, because everything out of my mouth is just a show reference.  That makes no sense.  She's like, what, uh, Opie?  She's like, what, Opie?  Opie, please, Opie, answer this.  Opie, please help me.  We're live.  I'm going to have that retard answer.  Anything else?  He's not making any sense.  Frank is.  Is this going to bring any, any industry-wide changes?  Or is this just going to be one of these sad stories that sort of fades from the headlines eventually? 
[01:08:00]  No, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, I think the boss is going to, you know, uh, kind of, pretty much wreck it for everybody else.  I mean, the bosses in radio in general are beyond scared as it is.  And, uh, now that we officially have killed the listener out there, yeah, I think you're going to hear a lot of really, really boring radio.  No one's going to really try to go to the, go to the edge or, uh, do anything edgy.  Well, Anthony.  I mean, didn't, didn't the management maybe say, hey, did you talk to a doctor about this or something? 
[01:08:30]  And maybe, uh, get some confirmation that this is dangerous or not.  So, Anthony, you're throwing it up the food chain a little bit.  That management maybe should get involved and maybe should be held accountable.  Yeah, maybe you say, you know, did you talk to a doctor about this or something, you know.  Maybe management should have looked into this and seen if it was a little more dangerous than they thought.  Opie and Anthony, we really thank you for taking the time to be with us today.  Thank you, Allison.  Thank you.  Allison.  She sounded defeated by the end of it. 
[01:09:00]  She's like, just thank you.  Oh, this is my big coup interview of the day and they're just goofing on me.  You guys really have no respect for her.  It was, it was, you know, nothing personal against her, really.  I like the girl.  She's nice and everything like that.  But, you know, we said yesterday that we were going to try to do this and show as many stupid show references in.  The only regret I have is that Jimmy Norton isn't here today because he'd have passed out laughing. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I just know him.  This type of crap gets him so excited and to get the Frankus in there.  The Ramona Frankus show.  And we got the pictures of E-Rock in the pink bunny suit on opianthony.com as he shoves marshmallows in his face.  He get a pink bunny suit.  The video.  Exactly.  The video of what you just heard is up on opianthony.com and it's also up on YouTube as well.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  And Opie, he kept saying kill a listener. 
[01:10:00]  Well, it's just a funny sentence.  Dude.  No one sets out to kill a listener.  Yeah.  I knew we were going down this road.  I knew I was going to just be a good cop.  But I didn't realize how funny he was going to make it with that Ramona and Frankus and the bunny suit and the E-Rock family.  I could not get back on track.  I haven't recovered.  I'm like, he's not doing this.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Remember when I, earlier in the program, when I goofed on Mike Woods, the weatherman, saying that it was going to snow here in New York and I heard all the weather forecast? 
[01:10:30]  I'm looking out the window at a blizzard right now.  Yeah.  Maybe I should just shut up and not contradict a weatherman.  Yeah, well.  Yeah.  It's a whiteout condition.  It's like a blizzard outside.  It's unbelievable.  I'm an ass.  A bunch of people saying, wow, you guys assaulted the media yourselves.  Yeah.  You know, that's why we're one with the listeners.  That's right.  We asked them to assault the media.  But if they're going to do it, we got to do it, too.  We can be just as stupid. 
[01:11:00]  That's the best thing, honestly, about you guys.  Because, you know, any other jock would have took this way too serious, like, oh, yeah, listen, well, you know, I'm glad you're calling me and had, like, all this really intelligent theories about what's going on.  You guys said, who is this lady?  And you said, yeah, whatever.  You know what the problem was?  We had been in this situation before where other jocks just pile on to the news and talk about our careers and how we're done and gave their opinions and who gave a crap about what we did and why we were fired and all that. 
[01:11:30]  The last thing I wanted to do is be one of these guys, well, you know, it's going to be tough to them get another job back again.  And you're right.  They go there.  It's all self-promotion.  Any jock that is doing a news talk show about another show besides their own is just doing it to get their face and name out there.  It's like a comic when they get on a news show and they're serious.  I don't want to see you talk about politics.  I want to see Robin Williams be an idiot and go, ah, and flip out. 
[01:12:00]  Just have fun with it and goof.  Cool is the enemy of funny.  Well, after the break, you're going to hear the difference because then Bill O'Reilly dragged us into this story last night on his show, showing B-roll of Ant and I in an old studio.  And Mancow did it differently.  He had to be the, quote, expert on this whole topic.  We will never be the experts, Opie.  Huh, nah.  We will never be the experts.  We will be the douchebags.  Yeah, well. 
[01:12:30]  There you go.  The video's up on opieandanthony.com.  We really, really enjoyed that a lot.  A lot of people got thrown with the Psycho Mark one.  They knew all the other references.  They were like, what was the doctor thing?  I didn't get it.  Did you talk to your doctor?  Got to go back.  Did you talk to your...  Because Psycho Mark, like, had this voice where he'd be like, ah, there was these people and, ah, like, he was out of his mind.  And then he'd do the commercial reads and it was like, did you talk to your doctor about Stanker 2?  He was serious, uh, yeah, commercial voice guy. 
[01:13:00]  Well, there's the testimonial.  Be sure you call now.  So he put on this hack voice, though.  I gave a little Psycho Mark tribute last night.  That threw me, too.  I was all nervous, too.  Like, I'm sitting there on the phone and I got the TV on with the mute button on and I see our pictures and I'm like, oh, we're going to go soon.  And I started getting butterflies and I'm like, what are you, an idiot?  You do a show every day.  What are you afraid of?  Like, we're 14 again doing prank phone calls.  That's exactly what I felt like. 
[01:13:30]  But you threw me because I knew what I...  I was a great man for this.  Yeah.  Good cop, whatever.  And it was the, you know, the bad cop.  And...  But he threw me with how crazy he got with his references.  You really were fish-tailing.  Oh, I know.  He was like, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Oh, that is classic.  You actually caught something.  You're like, wow, you know, the people upstairs are...  I think.  They're mad about things when you do stuff.  Say, ah, on board, ah, pizza.  Wow.  Let's go with, ah, John in Queens.  John.  Hey, what's up, Ope? 
[01:14:00]  Hey, John.  Hi, Anthony.  Hey, man.  Hey, I thought the really funny part about that was that moment that you hear Opie get the douche  sweats where he just goes oh it's like it's like a chemistry class when you when you get called on  it's just like i totally don't have the answer no i didn't have the answer because i just heard  anthony with the bunny suit and the nagle family and the ramona frunkus i'm like because we were  because that was the whole discussion on xm yesterday how do we work in the word frunkus  and he did it i'm like there's no way you're gonna get away with that so when he did that

[01:21:00]  what i did i didn't even like face to face do it i just snuck up behind her like a vc and hit her  right in the shoulder blades right between the shoulder blades her air just went she was down and  out and then my father told me no you jackass not girls you don't hit girls no matter what you  just went to the woods and got a nice big tree branch and cracked her in that first and last time  big branch it was big big long a lot of leverage a lot of swing pop uh pops never had a problem

[01:23:30]  i did with the stick she had heard hey if some guy hassles you uh kick him in the groin and then  decided to just give it a test run to see what it looks like and if it works and i just right on  the ground and uh she walked away laughing and if if i ever had the reason again to pick up a big  stick and whack a big girl between the shoulder blades it was then but you know i thought i'll just  let it go just let it be probably just weren't near trees yeah i was in no position to grab anything

[01:24:30]  of me and she just called me a fat piece of whatever uh i i moved to another way and i just  clocked her nice are we actually talking about beating up women well no it's like your first  experience with hitting a girl yeah it was it was so empowering until the rest of the football  team beat me down it was so empowering you felt you felt great you really do because they  go down so easy is it the uh what's the opening sequence uh was it way of the gun can't remember 
[01:25:00]  the movie what's that one with uh i have no idea anyone remember i'm not even gonna try to  damn it on this one sarah silverman okay just gets clocked right in the face yeah yeah way of  the gun i actually hit my uh me and my chick got into a fight this is a true story i i was you know  you know you get in a fight with your girl and you get so mad whatever you'll smash a cop you'll punch  your wall but i had i was i had raw chicken in my hand and i was cooking i swear i was cooking the 
[01:25:30]  chicken and uh i want to throw it against the wall like i'm not just you know forget it we're not  eating now but the chicken slipped out of my hand and slapped her it slammed her right in the face  wild pitch with the chicken it was but i i went you know when you laugh you're just trying to give her  a little chin music with the uh i i hit her in the face and it slapped but it stuck to her cheek  and it was just kind of sliding down so you're kind of like oh man you know you're like oh i  don't want to hurt you but it's really funny what was it a nice cutlet it's like a cutlet and it's 
[01:26:00]  how do you not laugh at that because you know at that point because there's a cutlet stuck to the  side of your chick's face she she balled up her fist and came at me and i just i had to put all my  weight i had to put her on the ground and put all my weight on her just to hold it down because  that's like the only thing you can really do to a girl yeah it's just you know weigh them down with  all you weigh them down and calm them down yeah just like baby listen calm down i ain't calming down 
[01:26:30]  i'm gonna beat the crowd listen you're not gonna i'm not gonna let that happen it was chicken relax  all right i did accidentally oh here we go all right and this is and this is the x yeah this is the x oh  boy this was when things were going down okay you know i don't know why she decided to get so upset  that i would bring my girlfriend to a gig one of my band band was playing and why would she get so  upset with that i told her not to show up it was it was over at that point she decided she was going 
[01:27:00]  to show up you know had a few and uh started making a scene so um she my ex hated the c word like i  couldn't even say it recreationally i remember i couldn't call like remember i couldn't call someone  on tv it i couldn't if i said it it made an argument that you couldn't believe would last all night  until i would whisper women in general hate that word but it went a lot further with it was some  deep-seated thing there was something going on there anybody if i said it to an inanimate character in a 
[01:27:30]  video game he said it to someone that that that deserved it so if i named my problem that word  i would i would have never been able to have said yeah this is bob's kid yeah right c word but she hated  it and um she started mouthing off and making a kind of a scene and uh my girlfriend did the best thing  she could possibly do flipped her the bird and called her the c word so so my ex now lunges at her 
[01:28:00]  so i step in right and and try to like hold restrain her arms and get her out of the bar  as i'm doing it she trips and her head goes right into the jukebox  and uh yeah i think she got a cut over her eye oh it was and and i i was like i was like the first 
[01:28:30]  thing i thought is oh man i'm gonna be in trouble for this they're gonna like arrest me for throwing  a head through there but uh and then i thought god that was refreshing at that point you figured  you were all in so you kicked her a few times and uh let's be honest i was just escorted out of the  bar let's be honest though there's nothing like when you get mad at your girl giving her the nice  goon hand grabbing her by the elbow and just squeezing and dragging her out of somewhere  goon hand you know what i mean just putting that goon hand what is wrong with you right on her just 
[01:29:00]  i've never given the goon hand you grab them right behind right above the elbow on that little fat  and you squeeze it and you pick her arm up like a little chicken wing you drag her up  come here i want to talk to you but you see you're calm like to everybody around you but  you're pinching that fat and you're right give her the you come here i want to talk to you for a  second and you drive you're smiling as you're walking out so that's very italian people around  are seeing you smile i saw him walk out they were smiling and she was you know but you squeeze your 
[01:29:30]  come here i want to talk to you drag her right out right out of the mall you get into a fight and  like you know pottery bond hey listen come here she got four round bruises on one side of her arm  one big round one on the other where your big meat thumb was you gotta get a nice goon hand and  drag around in the parking lot because you really can't you can't argue in arguing in public let me  tell you something i was going to the uh you ever go to martha's vineyard you have to take a um i've  been there yeah you have to take that dumb ferry ferry yeah oh it's awful so uh we go to this stupid 
[01:30:00]  thing and i and i'm with we're going back and i she goes uh i would you like something to eat  and i go yeah give me a give me an egg sandwich with cheese and ham she comes back up with tuna  and mustard oh right and she deserves to get beat for that i didn't say beat i never beat it jesus  stop jumping the gun slap it with the sandwich no but you know there's like everybody around all  these little happy white families from cape cod and me and i'm like i didn't what did i say  did i say turkey and she's like uh well that's all they had i don't like a relationship that was 
[01:30:30]  in trouble you couldn't come up and ask me and she's like listen and they get mad at you right  but this is what she did she kept me going until i snapped yeah you know what i mean and then i  snapped i go listen all right it's not about the sandwich all of a sudden the fact not about the  sandwich anymore it's about the fact that we haven't had sex in three months because i love you  and i can't have sex with women i love i have to hate you oh wait a minute wait a minute back to  the story it's not my fault i'm having sex with everybody out there except you yes hey man i was 
[01:31:00]  just trying to give you a sandwich chill out without you she did she goes like this it's about the  sandwich everybody around was seeing us argue through our teeth you know when you grind yeah you  don't want to make a scene then she goes like this it was she goes it's a sandwich sandwich if you  want to fight about a sandwich and she starts and you're like you're like calm down just calm down  you know you calm down i'm coming down yeah you better calm down if you make if you make a scene 
[01:31:30]  i swear you will be thrown overboard that's when the goon hand comes into play right there  all right that's where you have to break out the goon hand now i get it you get the goon hand right  there you squeeze like listen don't you say sandwich one more time i swear to god i don't care i'm  on this furry you calm down yeah i want to talk to you on the lido deck get out here we'll take  we'll we'll we'll do we'll deal with this later when we get home no i want to not in public if you  make a scene in public i swear i will kill you i was never never been into the public scene 
[01:32:00]  the the public display of hatred and arguing and stuff is so embarrassing to me because it's i know  how entertaining it is when it's someone else there's nothing you're just watching a couple  argue there's nothing you stop you you stop with drop what you're doing if you're like the mall  and a couple's arguing and you have to get to a store you'll turn around and follow them just to 
[01:32:30]  hear uh the argument yeah you go get see where it goes go right to the food court get a couple  little uh little chicken teriyakis on yeah toothpicks and go you're just eating it's like a movie  all around right nothing better than seeing a couple fight to be part of that to be the center  stage yeah no never been into the scene i've done and believe me with my ex it was a scene  everywhere i just have to give a preamble before we went out at night it's like look i know we're  we're gonna be going out like every everything's fine right now we're both sober this is great but 
[01:33:00]  we're gonna go out now no matter what happens let's remember right now is there a problem like i'd  have to do this beforehand we went out no i go just remember that there's no problems  so later on after a few drinks don't think that there's a problem it's it's just the booze and  pass all that by how is that gonna help i don't understand was she hearing nuts because heroin  no after a few shots of jack daniel you're gonna remember the conversation you had when you were 
[01:33:30]  stone sober after you had a few pops but that was way that i was trying to put it in like a  a suggestion one of those like mental suggestions that i could pull out later through hypnosis so  she would we we'd be out drinking she'd do a few shots of jack yeah ben some spoons mind control  giving her a mental suggestion mind control so she'd do a few shots and then before i know it it would  be like you know you and hole and that and just an argument would start out of nowhere and then i'd 
[01:34:00]  try to bring back what i said i said remember earlier today when i said there was no problem  i go that's still right now there's no there's a problem it's yeah i don't like how anthony is  completely sober in this conversation oh no i was drunk but i never slurred when i was drunk no anthony  i was pretty amazing when he's drunk all the best drunk you understand right there happy right there  when she went yeah you grabbed the the goon hand goon hand would have would have solved all of it 
[01:34:30]  yeah i should have used the goon hand a little more little goon hand the italians and the blacks  made the goon hand up the black the black pimp the blacks called it something else started with a c  i saw some things i saw some things back in the day saw some things yeah yeah yeah i saw some things  look at him he's looking down yeah yeah because it's very uncomfortable when anthony decides to  go down this road but wow i saw some things now you you were actually you didn't have a girl when  did you yeah absolutely so you had a girl but you and you had to watch this this this relationship 
[01:35:00]  over here yeah yeah and then uh yeah my chick at the time decided to take uh uh aunt's wife's side  that made for a lot of fun and uh boy their relationship crumbled pretty quickly after that  yeah of course it did how are you gonna have weird radio partners right my ex is now you know hated  from from by me and i i heard that my ex was driving anthony's ex-wife to the lawyer i'm like are you  insane while you were with her yes goon hand that's where it comes to goon hand come here i want to talk 
[01:35:30]  to you you don't drive her anywhere that was pretty much uh the last straw no my favorite was right  right when uh uh the proceedings started yeah divorce proceedings started and um uh opie's chick  and my ex his ex chick and my ex future ex-wife at the time uh used my amex card to get a cruise  they went out of them they went on a cruise together his chick i was already living my own life at this

[01:44:00]  working anymore his ratings were dropping he tried to change his show and his ratings dropped even  further this is the guy that wears his sunglasses all the time well no now he's not wearing his  sunglasses he's on now he's trying to look more and more like sean hennity every day and it's not  going to happen and cal muller you're not surprised you're not uh surprised about this are you i mean  this shock jock stunts just get more bizarre and more bizarre and this is just bound to happen right  well bill this type of radio is dead and there's a reason it's dying uh you know we're living in 
[01:44:30]  important times in this kind of voyeuristic radio really has died uh most of the really bad stuff  has gone to satellite some of it still lingers and uh but it's a dying art form if it is that  oh my god it's dying because we're living in in important times huh what what are you talking about  he's trying to be serious  yeah with his radio voice it's not even that can i mean it's not that shocking she drank water 
[01:45:00]  whoa if she drank horse pee i'd be like wow that's shocking  whoa whoa she drank water yeah i mean every what what is so this isn't a shock shock they she  accidentally died because you know what off the fact that this really isn't shocking and probably i  i don't know a bunch of morning shows across america have done a contest very similar to this  thinking they're doing some kind of in innocent but a little crazy a little woo woo a little oh my god 
[01:45:30]  she she's holding and she she needs to take the leak type radio this is no one expected that they  were taking any chance you guys in that room that you guys had a diabetic drink eggnog which is  basically milk sugar milk sugar yeah this is this isn't a uh a stunt it's not it's a contest right  radio station contests have been going on for years and they will continue to go on for years  it's a contest it's wacky radio contest like sit on a block of ice last person up gets a pair of 
[01:46:00]  tickets to see justin timberlake that type of drinking water is not shocking no these guys didn't  think they were we're gonna get anywhere near someone dying shutting down traffic on a bridge  with a cow yeah that's a shock jock stunt throwing a dead hooker off of a building off oh all right  yeah that too by the way shocking i think they dumped out down the hall uh bob kelly said it would  be shocking if she was uh drinking something else besides water and then he mentioned something to do 
[01:46:30]  with uh uh well will that mess it up i i don't think so something to do with a horse all right there you  go all right uh it continued last night it seems to be in the smaller markets like sacramento  every market has them you know you turn on the morning radio it's usually in the morning and a half  even here in new york i mean opie and anthony are back on uh and that disgust oh he doesn't want to  hear that fact we're back on radio oh does he hate it manco yeah no bill and bill o'reilly bill o'reilly 
[01:47:00]  hates you too oh my god he does yeah wow yeah because he's so morally believe we're back on the  radio he thinks we shouldn't work ever again he's so high above us morally that uh we just  discussed him yeah we may be uh pretty effed up on the air but at least we're not effed up in our  you know our private lives like uh mr o'reilly oh i wonder how much that settlement was yeah i wonder  how much that settlement how much that settlement was that you paid that woman pretty amazing that you 
[01:47:30]  uh made that go away so she wouldn't uh expose that audio tape so you wouldn't look like uh what's  his name like pat you know the allegations of phone sex and uh and uh and and things and the shower  yeah yeah if we all forgot about that right mr o'reilly phone sex loofah thing i mean all of a sudden  it went away because you doled her out a bunch of cash doesn't mean it didn't happen it just means  you settled you're the moral compass of a tool you're back on um these are the guys that did the 
[01:48:00]  thing in saint patrick's cathedral but what i'm trying to say is there doesn't seem to be any  regulation man cow these these guys if they can pull into numbers they can do whatever they want  to do look we don't which by the way is not true anymore no that whole thing did change after our  sex for sam stunt yeah so why don't you update your research it is really tough to do a radio show 
[01:48:30]  in this day and age as far as the edgy stuff goes the shock jock type of things uh go yeah you're  talking about uh maybe how radio was done four or five years ago at this point you dummy yeah it  doesn't work like that anymore they'll fire your ass in a second do your research it's really tough  no matter what your ratings are first they can do whatever they want to do look we don't need more  government regulation that's not what i'm saying i have a station management regulation well and  that's in place trust me it's in place oh my god trust me it's in place believe me 
[01:49:00]  gotta pull teeth around here to do anything well i just said something about a horse and that's you  can't even say that right well they probably dumped out of that yeah there you go yeah yeah  his info is outdated station management regulation well and and you see you see what kind of management  we have in radio where opie and anthony who by the way as you know they just lost 40 percent of  their audience in chicago they're in last place so the truth so he has to take a shot at us because 
[01:49:30]  he is so frustrated he is so frustrated here's his here's his time in the spotlight and bill o'reilly  has to mention us how about your you lost 100 percent wow he did really quick with math  don yeah that math is easy when you have no listeners in chicago i know that's a hundred  percent of your audience look man this show is still growing you know and we just started in  chicago it's way too early so you didn't lose anybody uh we've lost we're pretty honest in the 
[01:50:00]  show we've lost a bit of our audience in new york in the last uh ratings book yes it happens  yes but the show is still growing fall in love with a new show that comes into town it's not one of  those things where it's like oh i like the music this station plays and people turn in they gotta  accept the personalities listen for a little while it just happens talk radio takes a while to catch on  it's it's still early in the game we just got major support from our big bosses yesterday  we're still doing it man cow is not doing it in the big markets anymore he's doing it in these tiny 
[01:50:30]  little little cities that you never heard of or you could barely pronounce by the way i love he got  kicked out of his hometown of chicago i love how bill o'reilly said uh you know you see it all the  time in these small markets like sacramento meanwhile man cow is drooling like i wish i'd have  sacramento holy jesus you just called it a small market i'm dreaming of a sacramento at this point in my  career guys in nowhere but he has to take a shot at us and he knows he's been in radio long enough  to know that uh we haven't been on in chicago long enough for anyone to make a real uh uh real opinion 
[01:51:00]  about the show you guys and where it's going if it's going to be successful or not you've been on  there for months right not years months and we uh trust me it's nothing to brag about but we've  moved the needle like like this just like a little yeah a little nothing to brag about i'm not sitting  here going we're you know we're on our way in chicago but uh we're holding steady a lot of  things not to brag about so we're holding steady but he knows it's way too early to start bragging 
[01:51:30]  about how we're uh in last place in chicago i've lost 40 percent of our audience well you lost 100  of your all of them chicago all of them never got to broadcast in new york city and when you're in  radio sorry for the rest of the cities here but the fact is if you're in radio you want to be heard  in new york city and he tried for many many many many many years to be heard in new york city  his uh parent company uh gave him a shot like one day because someone was on vacation and they went 
[01:52:00]  ah yeah yeah yeah no no what happened to it never gonna happen what happened to his fox uh news show  one and done one episode it was so bad one and done they didn't even consider uh giving him  another shot yeek so so keep uh new york new york is number one is new york what's the number one  market you're in radio your dream is to just do it in new york simple as that and most people just  before syndication it was like you're big in new york that's a big gig and and i remind people if we 
[01:52:30]  suck so bad when we got fired for our sexual sam thing guess who was calling our staff behind the  scenes to try to hire all of them because uh you know we were a very successful show when we got  fired and he figured wow you know maybe i can hire his staff away yeah who was the guy calling our  agent because we had the same agent at the same time uh before we got fired trying to get anthony  and i to fly to chicago he was gonna he was gonna treat us uh on the town with limos and steak dinners  and strip clubs and all this he wanted to get in our good graces because we were powerful in the 
[01:53:00]  company at the time and we would then go back uh here to new york and talk about the bosses like oh  you gotta hire this guy man we we uh we're up there in chicago and yeah we think he could be uh great  on the same station we're on and we said no  leave he forgets all that now as he takes his shots at us as we have in radio where opie and anthony  who by the way as you know they just lost 40 percent of their audience in chicago they're in last  place so the truth is that no matter what viacom gives us in cbs america doesn't want this we want 
[01:53:30]  something with core values that's why your radio shows the success that's why why uh why we're the  fastest growing show in america fastest growing show in america i knew that would piss you off  this guy is a give me the give me the blatant liar give me the list of markets uh man cows in you  want to get a tree and smack him in the back of the spot oh do i want to hit him with a tree see  because he knows whoever's watching this they're not going to check their facts and go no well he's  saying he's the fastest growing show in america he's got to be fastest growing show in america 
[01:54:00]  you're hemorrhaging markets you're not on in new york you're not on in philly you're not on in  boston you're not on in washington those are biggies right there fastest growing is lying all right  he's in uh well he's he's right anthony he's in was where is this town he's in a he's in a city in  wisconsin called wasaw wasaw w-a-u what w-a-u-s-a-u naga naga naga be broadcasting here no more

[01:56:00]  lewis and clark there you go nice talking to you he's the only he's the only guy in radio that  give me a nice smash believe you know what i said he's the only guy in radio that does a radio show  and sells pelts on the side beaver pelts out of his canoe obi i said martin and lewis martin and lewis  wow yeah lady lady fastest growing show in america um people are sick of this stuff in the small  markets they can't get any talent so they do this voyeuristic easy stuff but but bill let me tell 
[01:56:30]  you something i do think these people are murderers in my opinion these guys are murderers by the way  when we goofed on msnbc yesterday yeah we were more accurate than this douche exactly serious  first of all they're not murderers uh per se they're not murderers they're cruel you can't you  can't yeah you can't put these guys in the same category as somebody who uh is uh going over to  kill somebody uh because maybe they're cheating or rob somebody and then you kill them in the robbery 
[01:57:00]  and they're a murderer they they it doesn't fit in that category they're they're wacky radio show  that had a a horrible thing go wrong with one of their uh contests man cow calls a murderer huh  yeah you can't be you know you know murderers oh it's so stupid you know murderers that's an  insult to murderers everywhere anthony i i owe him an apology he's hurting uh cape may  cape may all the way cape may where is cape may this idiot goes on and says he's the fastest 
[01:57:30]  radio show and bill o'reilly doesn't even call him out on it he's on a cape o'reilly's on his fraud  yeah why didn't o'reilly say oh you are can you explain that yeah why didn't he say that he could  have just turn around and said oh really really explain how you're the fastest growing show in  america all right i'm sorry he's in uh well this one is this is a biggie he's on a am in stockton 
[01:58:00]  ah stockton is in the state of red island georgia well it's stockbridge sweden sweden  where is that i don't know man cow where's stockton california stockton you know how many great uh  uh radio markets there are in uh in california and guess what stockton doesn't come to my list  where is stockton san francisco la san diego barstow sacramento uh fresno sacramento of course yes 
[01:58:30]  the lawsuit is going to be unbelievable not only against the shock jocks who did it but against  the station and against who owns they're not shock jocks god damn that that they are a zoo type  like chatty two guys and the girl they're not shock jocks look at their stupid website  it shows them they do interviews they had they get guests like friggin uh uh real actresses will  come on their show shock jock shows don't get that if it was a shock jock they'd spit in the water 
[01:59:00]  you have to drink drink it water that i just hucked a louis in right put your head over the edge of  the uh uh garbage pail and let someone vomit on you yeah something like that something like that  they're in the category of silly radio and it went horribly wrong yeah they do like advice  show day and the girl will be like oh guys that they're not shock jocks you know what you could  have every morning show in america today do that exact same contest i would bet whatever that no one 
[01:59:30]  would die nothing would happen that's how rare that thing was yeah oh god blame the blame the mother  and it's tragic and all that school and getting a good job so you can buy your kid a kid a god damn  nice wee system we whatever it is against who owns the station because as i said there doesn't seem to  be any regulation in radio see here's the difference man cow and you do fox and friends so you know  television business yeah i i am held responsible does he for what i do out here you know i have  management but you're not held responsible for what you do when uh you're not on the air huh bill 
[02:00:00]  when you're home on the phone lucky bill who has enough money to pay people off yeah pay a settlement  so a woman maybe doesn't uh put out a tape that exists of uh phone calls that went back and forth  uh uh maybe uh you pay off a woman if um if uh she's got legitimate uh sexual harassment  yeah how'd you spin that one with your wife bill what was the no spin zone there how'd you spin that  lovely little tale with uh the good old wife while you're out to dinner zone the guy should broadcast 
[02:00:30]  from the teacup ride at disney no spins on my ass bill o'reilly's a douche everyone knows it  you know i have management that if i had a contents like this they would say you can't do that o'reilly  you can't do it you're not going to do it and there's there's quality control across the board not  only at fox news but in every area of television news is there any quality control why well when 
[02:01:00]  you're dealing with these smaller markets these guys are pretty much left alone to uh to try to  figure out their way through a very tough a business and you know this is a powerful tool  and you have to be careful with it you're careful how you use it and uh look i've had some hard  lessons along the way you know look at look at uh emis and uh jeff somalian's company there in new  york where they had black women hitting each other for prizes yeah and this guy just threw up his  hands and went hey that's what they do great but uh you know these people need to be held  accountable i don't know if we we need more government certainly this woman that drank all  the water some personal responsibility she should have stopped but uh you know she didn't know i mean 
[02:01:30]  this poor woman just wants to get the game for her kids and and she's doing this stunt yeah i think  water's gonna hurt her yeah she's dead but you know what i think it is i think it's the bucks  i i think the radio the competition for the radio dollar is so intense  that the these radio stations say if you can pull in the numbers no matter what you do i'm  going to put up with it and go ahead that's why it happens i'll give it a last word well bill the  last word is these guys are in real estate now the creative people are uh have been pushed out 
[02:02:00]  consolidation makes it so corporations own everything these aren't creative people and  they don't know what to do so they're doing stupid stuff like this and they don't care about  the listeners they don't they want to make a buck and that's why we get wacky zoo uh stupid  morning shows and it's all fun until someone dies so when you were doing all the wacky stupid stuff  that was uh proving that you weren't creative either yeah that was stupid uh what oh god ike 
[02:02:30]  if there's one person if i had to pick one person in radio that i absolutely effing lutely cannot stand  it is him really over over stern and stern personally like through roadblocks into our  career personally went behind the scenes to bosses and and directly affected us uh through his own  insecurities and everything uh went to mel karmazin screwed with our career directly man cow just 
[02:03:00]  mouths off but i swear i hate this guy more than i do stern why is that because he's a  he's such a lying douchebag crap he has no he has no real identity changes his identity with the  times you gotta give the fact is he did a lot of shock jock type of stuff and that's all he knew how  to do and when the shock jock genre started going away you know you have to adjust and we're watching  like careers end because they couldn't adjust and start doing something else on the radio and his 
[02:03:30]  thing is well i'll do a political thing no one gave a crap he started talking about family values  on his dumb show in chicago and people were like we don't want to hear this when we're driving in  in the morning so they got rid of him but the radio isn't like music like you know like you guys aren't  like glam bands and you know and like you're gonna have to wait for your turn again to come around  i mean radio this it doesn't go away like music you know what i mean yeah it's like talk radio  types of music kind of we were very successful with the shock jock thing absolutely but we also were 
[02:04:00]  we're funny back in the day when we're doing the shock jock stuff and very clever you gotta adapt so  we're adapting and we're doing just fine we got we got a big uh thumbs up from the bosses yesterday  and man cow isn't doing just fine he made such a left turn he tried to um a right turn he tried to go  from shock jockery to um like a serious political show like like hannity he wants to be legit and after 
[02:04:30]  you've done uh porno you know you can't really be legit he's done porn no i'm figuratively speaking  yeah it's like the actress that wants to be a legitimate actress but you know won uh porn award  for uh dp or something you know and that's not director of photography hey iraq iraq go get some  man cow cds we'll show you how hacky he was when he was doing the shock jocks yeah that he wants  everyone to forget about hey really fast hold on hold on hold on really fast and don't start another  thought because we are so late tom's gonna rock down tom's gonna slap us like uh like one of 
[02:05:00]  anthony's old girlfriends in a minute here you're on lockdown i didn't really never slapped a  girlfriend no i know it didn't make sense i was trying to go hit it with a child miserably  down the street our listeners are great at doing research someone from their cell phone  wasaw w-a-u-s-a-u yeah uh is the 10th biggest city in wisconsin oh so he is doing pretty good  he is the fastest growing uh radio show but he said america there you go liar you're a liar 
[02:05:30]  thank you and bill o'reilly biggest hypocrite yeah call him out on it no hypocrite out there  it's the opian anthony show it's the opian anthony show  hey thanks for the support we greatly appreciate it it's the opian anthony show 
[02:06:00]  being heard in some great cities like las vegas nevada dallas texas west palm beach florida  of course new york boston washington cleveland philadelphia buffalo do we have to go on mantel  do we have to go on being heard in chicago you're not being heard in chicago  you douche yeah he's off 
[02:06:30]  it's really time to go after bill o'reilly big time we've been kind of flirting with that  hypocrite he's been but it's really time to just just show the world what he's all about  we'll show you how clever we really are  all right hey uh i love rosie i can't help it yeah i don't necessarily agree with what she says 
[02:07:00]  on a daily basis on the view but uh she's just taking over that show uh eventually donald trump  is right she will be gone from that show because they can't handle her when the ratings kind of  even out and start going down slightly they'll be like all right we rode rosie as much as we can  we need to get a little friendlier face in here and rosie will move on and she'll do her own show  and she's gonna kick ass because now it's the new rosie the real rosie just uh very opinionated 
[02:07:30]  just speaking her mind uh every single morning on the view some of the stuff i'm like but at least  she's uh you know speaking her mind i like that i like that in today's media and i think donald uh  uh that whole argument brought her brought her to the next level yeah like now that she did that  she could take on anybody yeah and uh no one's gonna say anything about it i way to keep the ratings  up for that stupid show i don't know if you heard this yet but she was talking about american idol  and i completely agree with what she said about american idol but i see nothing wrong with it 
[02:08:00]  yeah that's the difference big controversy this year with american idol but it's the highest rated ever  people are upset why are they interviewing a horse on uh uh good morning america this morning  it's weird they got like some kind of like like pet segment there's a couple dogs and they're also  interviewing a horse animal segment a horse with blonde hair it's really strange why would they have  big blonde mane big blonde mane i don't know why they would do that really strange are you talking 
[02:08:30]  about dogs or horses what's going on here which one the i see the two dogs but then there's the  the horse the horse let me see oh oh oh i'm on tv because that's low because i hoo hoo  anyway so rosie uh uh the american idol thing anthony i was distracted by the horse on tv yeah the american 
[02:09:00]  idol uh uh very controversial because they say it's too mean this year this season it's too mean  and um it's the highest rated ever so what do the people want 37 million viewers up 10 from last  year american idol and they're really going after the retards uh american idol american idol by the  way is two shows it's two different shows completely different shows there's the first show first 
[02:09:30]  couple shows are the goof which is goofing the retard show right it's uh what people some people have  called exploitation of the mentally handicapped and the second part of the show is a talent  competition where people that have talent you know uh face off with each other and they pick a winner  but it's the first half that people have a problem with yeah because they but why if out of 10 000  people that show up you want to pick the most interesting people the people that people are going to tune 
[02:10:00]  into and that happens to be retarded people yeah with their mothers with their retarded friends oh my  god the one with the the hair teeth and the and the boobs that sag down to her knees and the water  balloons and oh god i actually was eating and they brought the mother in i was eating dinner and i  actually started gagging they both had cotton candy yeah oh i just wanted to twirl a little  i can't get enough in there around there it's there you go kid there you go kid enjoy yourself and 
[02:10:30]  it's really simple the pc police as they like to be called whatever yeah you know they they're trying  to like shut all this down the reality is as a human being you like a freak show yeah you like a  freak show they shut down the freak shows at the circus so then we threw it on tv and now they're  trying to shut that down so then you still do a freak show but you make believe you're really  helping people you're separated from it enough because it's television if if it was like right 
[02:11:00]  in front of you well we do it on this show okay i can't use that i'm talking about the average person  yeah you know you you would maybe would be a little more uncomfortable if it was right in front of you  but it's on tv we gotta edit ourselves because we're running out of show so this is what i know this  is what rosie had to say about uh american idol yesterday and it was apparently not about the music  anymore we have a clip of it and then you can decide her voice got high  check it out you look a little odd your dancing is terrible the singing was horrendous and you look  like one of those creatures that live in the jungle with those massive eyes what are they called 
[02:11:30]  bush baby you are set simon you're crazy he's not ready he's okay no but i'm just okay  all it's okay simon you're gonna say what you're gonna say but you know what yep that's your opinion  you're entitled to but it's a pretty good opinion it's a great opinion i think you're pretty awesome  it's enough thank you thank you so much for coming down peace baby  what are they called the bush babies what are you doing 
[02:12:00]  with the big eyes massive eyes oh my god and by the way if you don't think you're into freak shows  why did you google bush baby yesterday to see what they look like everyone googled bush baby after  that was on tv not only that you know what came up yeah you put bush baby wasn't a white kid with  wide eyes it's gonna be a thailand website all right and uh running out of show don't dump they're gonna 
[02:12:30]  cut us off in some cities that's too bad but this is what rosie had to say about that last clip  so that's compassion for it isn't it folks isn't that what america thinks is entertainment  apparently make fun of someone's physical appearance yeah then when they leave the room  laugh hysterically at them three millionaires one probably intoxicated  doesn't paula realize oh my god probably good look you know she's she's telling it how it is but she 
[02:13:00]  is telling it how it is that's what american people want to see 37 million people can't be wrong she's  doing that but then she's trashing she's doing what she's saying is bad she's doing yeah it's okay for  you to do it to a millionaire and it's okay you do pull out paul abdu has a probably has a problem  okay and you're doing it to her but he she can't do it to her she can't laugh at a retard behind  close baby to a little wide-eyed psychopath who's gonna kill hooker someday yeah basically what she's  saying you can make fun of uh uh people if wait wait wait wait wait uh oh wow i had a thought and 
[02:13:30]  it's you can't make fun of retards make fun of millionaires was that it we'll see that well paul has  a problem too so why are you making fun of her but she's basically saying it's okay to make fun of paul  because she's a million she has thank you yes exactly yeah that's what i was trying to say  jesus doesn't make sense all right yeah oh there's the music the music man oh it's great i act surprised  every day even though i hit the button how does that work just want to tear down a wall for everybody 
[02:14:00]  today that can't be the music just ruined the wizard of oz for me it's like oh no the music started  they're cutting us off i saw you behind the curtain yeah sometimes i save my own ass i know i'm like  just babbling i'm like i know i'm going nowhere oh the music i had a great point but we gotta go  the music cuts us off opie hits the music kevin smith joining us at xm he uh he's running late  so if you're not joining us over next time you gotta yeah have yourself a great weekend i guess

[02:19:00]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of town all PM.  You know, I can't have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[02:19:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  All right, here we are at XM.  Let's introduce the players.  Bob Kelly sitting in for Jim Norton.  Jim's going to be on Steve Dahl's show in Chicago this afternoon on WCKG.  Support the commercial radio stations, please.  Our own Jimmy. 
[02:20:00]  I beg you, please.  Please.  And then we got, of course, Kevin Smith who couldn't get up.  Slept in.  Lucky bastard.  I'm not getting paid like you guys, so why get up?  Good point, good point.  If I wasn't getting paid, you're right.  I wouldn't be up at that ungodly hour.  It's nighttime.  It's still nighttime.  It stays dark here.  Yeah.  We played poker the other night until like 8 in the morning.  And it only got light at about 7.30.  It turned that little blue color and you look outside and went, uh-oh. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, shit.  It's happening.  We've been doing this a while.  Yeah.  I was just in Vegas and I was at a card table.  I was playing poker from 7.30 at night until 8.30 the next morning.  You just don't leave.  You beat me by an hour, so I went from 8 to 8.  Yeah.  You just...  At least you probably have free drinks where you were.  Or...  Yeah, well, it's a casino.  We were in our comic book store.  Yeah.  It was a real sausage party. 
[02:21:00]  No booze.  Bring your own.  Nothing to look at, but a couple issues.  Fucking Green Lantern.  That's it.  No, like, Borgata babes or anything like that?  There's none of that walking around, sir.  If we wanted to see some cheesecake, you had to open up the old issue of Gen 13.  Oh, my God.  Things of that nature.  Gen 13.  Yeah.  Do you know Kevin Smith, Bob?  No, I don't.  How are you doing, Kev?  Rob?  Nice to meet you, man.  I am.  That's great.  Do you have a...  So you put this on yourself at your place, and what do you have, like a buy-in or something  like that?  No, a buy-in would be illegal, sir, to run a poker game with a rake. 
[02:21:30]  I like to do that.  We don't do that kind of thing.  This is all for fun and games.  Yeah.  No profit.  Just the pride of winning.  Because I tried to do that at my house with Norton, Quinn, Keith, and Voss, and just,  you know, they come over, and then as soon as they come over, it's like, yeah, this game  stinks.  Let's play Queen.  Follow the Queen.  And there's always somebody trying to change the game to make it go quicker.  That sounds like a gay thing to me.  You just got to play Hold'em.  Chase the Queen?  Yeah.  Chase the Queen. 
[02:22:00]  I caught that right at the end.  What is the...  What's the...  Does anyone know, is it illegal to have a poker game?  I see billboards in L.A., like the campaign in Los Angeles is like, bring your home game  to our casino, because it's legal.  And they kind of paint it like it's illegal.  Yeah, I think, and I'm not 100% sure on this, but I believe if you have a home game  and the house is not making money in any way, then it's fine.  If you're running a poker joint in your house and you're taking a part of the rake or, you 
[02:22:30]  know, there's some kind of entry fee for the game, then there's a problem.  And there could be problems.  If it's just a bunch of buddies playing some cards, trading money with each other, there's  not a problem with that.  Where do you think the line is?  Like, if I gamble with you, if I'm like, I'll bet you $100 you won't let me drop a Roman  face mask on you.  All right.  And they...  You'd lose that bet myself.  All right.  And I lose that bet and money exchanges hands.  Can the government go after us?  I don't think so.  No.  No, I don't think so. 
[02:23:00]  God bless America.  You know what?  Yeah.  Just to introduce you to Bob Kelly.  He might go for that, actually.  Yeah.  What, a Roman face mask?  Yeah.  Just for the goof.  Why would you give me $100?  It was free, right?  They're starting to shut down all the online gaming that's been going on.  There's only a couple left.  I know one I still play on that I'm able to deposit money into.  Can you say which one it is?  No.  I kind of have a big show.  I'd rather not.  Just sign language.  It's me from here.  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  Two in the pink, one in the stink.  I'm not quite sure what that was.  That's how fingers moving around.  Let's see.  Let's call it empty, straight, standing up poker.  There it is.  Right on.  Gotcha.  I follow.  What a code.  I should have run codes.  Do you feel like that's something that you could get in trouble for?  I know.  Like, you're not going out.  You're not doing something bad to other people.  If anything, you're doing something bad to yourself.  I'm laying in bed in a little, you know, $30 buy-in room. 
[02:24:00]  There's nine other people there, eight other people, just playing some poker.  Maybe winning a hundred bucks.  Playing poker in your bed or jerking off?  And they're going to take the poker away.  The poker part.  And next up is the jerking off.  It's jerking off if we don't watch out and protect our poker.  What's that old axiom like I said nothing when they came for my friend?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But then they came for the jerking off.  Right.  And I realized there was no one left to protect me. 
[02:24:30]  All right, let's get right into this.  We got Jerry in Texas.  Jerry, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Bob Kelly, love you, but I got a question for Kevin Smith.  What's up, buddy?  When you called in a few months ago and they were asking about the Kramer thing and the N-word  in movies, how come you never said anything?  I think we did, didn't we?  I think so, yeah.  I'm pretty sure we referenced it.  Yeah, because that's the greatest racial thing I've ever heard.  Great in the way of, like, yay, down with blacks, or just funny? 
[02:25:00]  You said yay.  I'm just trying to figure out what the hell a nign-nug is.  Nign-nug?  Yeah, that was, I mean, you grew up in Jersey, you hear all sorts of racial epithets like that.  Yeah.  Great, dude.  Never employ them personally.  Love told you guys three, windfall coming.  Unless you're in traffic.  Well, we got a councilman in New York, they want to ban the word.  Altogether.  Yeah, they want to ban the N-word.  Saying the word already has its consequences.  That puts a lot of black comics out of work right there.  Yeah.  And what's his name?  Paul Mooney said he's not going to use the N-word on stage anymore.  Jamie Foxx was coming out of here. 
[02:25:30]  Jamie Foxx is, now that he doesn't have to do comedy anymore and he's an Oscar-winning actor,  he's decided to, I'm sure he made a few bucks off the word for the years with his act.  That's it.  I don't need it.  How often do you actually use it, though?  How often do I actually use it?  Oh, boy, you just asked me a question.  Let me see.  Wait a minute.  How long does it take to get back to Long Island?  Remember, I commute now.  I commute every day.  I drive myself in and out of New York City.  So, not just black racial epithets. 
[02:26:00]  I distribute them equally among all the races.  Right, right.  You hit them all equal.  Yeah.  Opportunity offender.  All of them.  There are some vans that will be in the left lane.  Some kind of Asian gang sign writing covering the entire van with spray paint.  This poor bastard's just trying to deliver something and his van is getting spray painted.  He's in the left lane, maybe 45 miles an hour.  And then I got to catch up to him, look, so I can go, oh, that figures. 
[02:26:30]  You know, give kind of a thing because Asians are known to be bad driver kind of thing.  Cab drivers, to me, I just refer to now as savages.  Right.  I can't.  They have no regard for anyone else on the road.  None.  And I don't even mean within city limits.  It's out on the Long Island Expressway.  Again, left lane, 35, 40 miles an hour sometimes.  They're on the phone. 
[02:27:00]  The best is when the dome light's on at night and they're doing paperwork.  They're filling out paperwork as they're driving two tons of steel down the street and in the wrong lane.  What's wrong with multitasking?  Yeah, exactly.  Busting the balls, for heaven's sake.  Well, I have no problem.  Right lane is for multitasking.  Left lane is complete concentration on driving.  I'm like a NASCAR driver.  However, I am ten steps ahead, ten moves ahead of what I got to do.  And if someone screws me up, I get very angry. 
[02:27:30]  And sometimes you don't know these people personally.  I don't know what he does at home.  I can't goof on him and go, hey, your lawn is too long.  Just look at the bags under his eyes and you just have to say something.  You just kind of blurt out.  You've got the easiest cut.  Cut him to the quick.  He can't even hear you.  He don't care.  He's doing his paperwork.  Well, you can't start banning words in America.  That's what I'm getting at.  I hear you.  These people are so stupid.  Don't.  That's a scary row to go down.  We have the DD audio.  I was just looking for that.  Yes.  All right.  We'll get to that because it involves Bob Kelly. 
[02:28:00]  How?  Me.  What'd I do?  We'll get into it a little later, but we do weekend shows here on 202, Kevin.  And last week.  Oh, some of the best programming ever is on the weekends here on 202.  It's like listening to really bad blogs.  I was saying some of the best.  Kevin had one.  Big Kev?  Big Kev had one.  Geek stuff?  Actually, in all fairness, I did not hear Big Kev's.  I heard the first 15 minutes, and he had it together.  He was focused.  It was just not my cup of tea because I'm not an uber geek.  I listen to his podcast, which the radio show is based on. 
[02:28:30]  It's true.  Yeah, it's good.  I have a radio show.  You can't move that mic in front of him, and then just moved it away.  I've said this before.  I have a radio show, but I want to do podcasts.  I do a podcast?  Isn't that ridiculous?  You just can't get enough air time.  I want to be on the air all the time.  In love with the sound of your own voice.  Because there's no pressure.  I can't get enough of me.  Whether I'm getting paid or not, I've got to hear somebody I agree with.  There's no pressure in a podcast.  That's why he wants to do it.  Completely just go on, whatever.  This is what I want to say, and I don't care if anyone likes it. 
[02:29:00]  The podcast I use, I do it from my phone.  You just call a number and just talk as long as you want and hit pound, and it sends it  to your MySpace.  Are you shitting me?  It sends it right to your MySpace.  Wow.  That's it.  So you do it from anywhere.  High quality.  How about you do one right now for everybody?  Okay.  Do a little podcast.  Do a little podcast.  We'll all be on your podcast on MySpace.  I do podcast.  Here I call.  I'm not going to be on your podcast.  I can't.  Yeah, you've got to be compensated.  There it is.  Yeah, you don't know what's on there.  Who knows?  Create your own podcast using nothing but a telephone. 
[02:29:30]  Get your voice heard and reach all your friends and fans using gcast.com.  Please enter your four-digit password or PIN.  Uh-oh.  This is free, too.  What's the password?  Let us all know.  Free.  Someone's going to get it just by listening to those sounds.  Oh, it's like 69, 69 to me.  Welcome.  Now you've recorded a new audience.  No, I should have learned that from War Games.  Yeah.  After the tone.  When you're done, press tone.  There we go.  Ready, set, go.  Hey, how you doing?  It's Robert Kelly.  We're doing a podcast. 
[02:30:00]  Hey, it's Bob Kelly's podcast.  Bob Kelly likes to suck cock.  Wouldn't that then be a rodcast, sir?  Please send as many dick pictures as you can to Bob Kelly's MySpace account.  The MySpace site you're on right now.  In case you didn't hear that, please send to Robert and Robert Kelly.  You know, there's no...  What are we going to say?  I have a fiancé.  We're going to shake him up?  There's no shock in him.  I have a fiancé.  I need something to get me hard.  Oh, fuck it.  And make sure the uncut, that cut stuff really turns me off.  Fuck you and your podcast. 
[02:30:30]  I love...  Well, you're sitting here fucking like you...  I'm kind of amazed by the technology, to tell you the truth.  And that's it.  And then you hit the pound.  I don't like that you're wearing your coat right now.  It's making me feel...  I'm cold.  It's cold in here.  Let's say hi to John in New York.  John, what's up?  Hey, good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, John.  Last weekend, D.D. agreed to lick Bob Kelly's asshole for a second show on X7 Satellite Radio.  Yeah, that's what I was getting at with Kevin Smith.  On the weekends, we have some specialty programs.  Last Saturday, it was D.D. 
[02:31:00]  She did a show.  So, it was average at best.  D.D.'s a girl from D.C.  The D.C. offices of X7.  I want to work for you guys in a big, bad way.  Yeah?  Tell Kevin, you're like, it was adequate.  I'm just not a geek.  D.D.'s show, not bad.  Not bad.  True support here from you dudes, man.  It's just, we give nothing.  Take me back for a second.  So, wait, do you have a fiance?  Yeah, I guess.  A dude or a girl?  A woman.  A woman.  But you love cock, is that what you got?  No, I don't.  It's the joke, the running joke?  Well, no, not a running joke.  I didn't see you looking at cock. 
[02:31:30]  Look, Kevin, that was just, that was just today.  Hold on.  For the fun for shits and giggles.  Hold on, Bob.  Look Kevin right in the eye and say you don't like cock.  Check it out.  I love your cock.  I mean.  Wait a second.  Let's try that again.  So, yes or no?  No, I don't like cock.  All right.  And you know this.  You got a bear thing going on.  That's why I asked.  A bear thing?  A bear thing?  Oh.  A bear, bear, bear.  I got a friend of mine that's dude, Malcolm.  I'm not really.  Dude, big dude looks like me.  Bigger than me.  You know what I'm talking about.  Big dude, right?  Fucking, he couldn't get laid, you know, in a $3 whorehouse with $400 bills. 
[02:32:00]  This dude gets, he fucking went gay.  This dude gets so much cock, it's insane.  And the dudes he gets, you would just be shocked by.  Dudes, I would fuck these dudes.  They're like cover boys.  Good looking like, you know, Joe College material and shit.  Like he's a bear and there are some dudes out there that that's what they're into.  That's amazing that that should be an option.  I'm not a bear though.  For a guy, you know?  You're like, you can't get laid.  You're not an active bear, but you would be a bear.  No, because I don't have, I don't have hair.  Doesn't matter, you just have to also be kind of chubby.  I have like, I'm like a half a bear. 
[02:32:30]  Just because you wax your chest doesn't mean you're not.  I don't, I don't wax.  That's it, you just can't grow up?  I wax my ass, my girl waxed my ass once.  Right up the hole instead?  No, just the cheeks.  I wish she did the hole.  Why not the wrinkles?  Because my, my stink wrinkle is awful.  Right, right, right.  It really is.  It looks like a.  Gotta pull the hair off that star flister.  It looks like Clint Eastwood back in the, the good, the bad, and the ugly.  Uh, yeah, it's awful.  As much as it shoots people.  Yeah.  Arlen Steve is a bear. 
[02:33:00]  Is he?  That's a bear.  Steve's been called a bear by people in the porn industry.  Well, we don't know.  Right.  But if he was, let's say if he was.  If he was.  We sent him out to, uh, the, uh, porn awards out there in Vegas, uh, a few days back, and  the guys love him.  They, he, he's a, a bear.  He's got his, uh, facial hair is perfect for that.  Right.  Where's Steve?  Here he comes.  Look, see?  The guys love him. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  He looks like a muscle queen to me more than anything else.  Muscle queen.  If you had the label.  How do you know?  I love that you know all the terms.  Size queen.  Muscle queen.  My brother's gay.  I'm surrounded, I'm, I work in, in movies, dude.  I'm surrounded by gay people.  Gay people all over the place.  I'm one six pack away from a cock in the mouth myself.  Gay guys have the best terminology for what they are.  They do, man.  A size queen.  How great is that?  Yeah.  Power bottom.  I like, uh, power bottom.  I like sloppy bottom myself.  Sloppy bottom?  Sloppy party bottom.  So that means you go, sloppy party bottom is like, you're the dude that likes to take, 
[02:34:00]  and you like to take from multiple people in an evening.  So you, your diet is built around not having it be too messy back there.  Um, and then you go to a party and you are just the receiver for many.  Sloppy party bottom.  He's talking about that.  And I didn't understand that term.  And I asked my friend, I was just like, sloppy party bottom.  So it's kind of like, scotch out there into shit.  And they're like, no, they like it clean.  And that was the thing that I was fascinated by.  Cause my friend was telling me like, no.  And I keep saying my friend, um, there's no, like shit's not an option, not a factor, 
[02:34:30]  but it's like, well, that's where shit comes out of.  How can it not be a factor?  But they keep their diet regulated so that, so that when shit takes time to gather.  So basically, you don't eat kidney beans so the skin doesn't come out on your helmet.  Pretty much.  Oh, God.  Pretty much.  A lot of Metamucil so that it comes out quickly and easily.  And it's just a lot of cum being pumped in there.  Ass-wise sloppy.  Ass-douching to keep it ready to go.  And the sloppy part is just all the cum.  Have you heard of that term before?  I love when we hear something for the first time.  A sloppy party bottom.  It's very rare we hear something for the first time of the show. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, it's fun.  The party, that's what really gets me into it.  The party is in the word.  So you know it's fun.  But it's misleading because more than one person, you suddenly are sloppy party bottom.  You got two dudes, that's not really a party.  And it's really not a sloppy.  Yeah, that's a get-together.  Yeah, you're watching a game and shit, and two dudes are like, I want to drop it in your ass.  Nut.  You know, and you're like, all right, it's a party.  I'm a sloppy party bottom.  Isn't it odd that the first guy really isn't getting the sloppy party bottom experience?  Totally.  That dude's getting screwed.  He's like, well, somebody's got to go first.  He's like John Glenn on the moon. 
[02:35:30]  He's like, all right, one small step.  You go first.  One small step.  I'm a huge one.  And the party gets better and better.  This is why Steve would be a bear because, and don't get mad at me, Steve, because I  know you get a little angry.  Why would I?  Because you shave your arms.  Because I'm obnoxiously hairy.  And that's my point.  You shave or you wax him?  Shave.  Really?  That's why you'd be a bear.  Is that a daily thing?  Every three days or so, it gets like a little bit longer. 
[02:36:00]  He's Lebanese.  What a pain in the ass.  One more thing to do in the shower, man.  It is.  It is.  An obnoxious pain in the ass.  If I could wax it or do something else, I would.  Do you shave just your arms or do you shave your chest and your bum and your balls and  your taint and your legs and your knees and your calves?  My back, I think I had nared once, but it doesn't, it just burns too much.  It burns, I'm worried about scarring up my tattoos with a nared.  What, the cum after the nared comes off?  Exactly.  Thank you.  You have to shave so you know where his body parts are.  Yes, exactly.  I've got to shave, you know, pretty generously.  Like his hair goes right to his, right to his chest hair, goes right to the beard. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, chest hair goes right to the beard.  So your eyebrow hair and your pubic hair connect.  Yeah, I mean, kind of.  My eyebrows would blend into my hairline if I let it go.  Really?  Dude, it's ridiculous.  Wow.  Do you send it, does your hair grow thicker during the winter?  Somebody just told me recently that like in the winter your hair tends to grow.  No, I haven't noticed.  I haven't noticed.  I mean, maybe if I let it grow long enough, then I'd find out.  You'd be through years of evolution that would just stop on humans.  Yeah, totally.  It's like, what do we need body hair for?  I mean, there's a gap and shit like that. 
[02:37:00]  I've got a house, I've got clothes, I've got a heater.  So Kevin, what is he again?  He's a workout?  I would say muscle queen.  Muscle queen.  All right, bring in Travis.  It's Travis's turn.  He threw his hands on.  I know what Travis is called.  I know what Travis is called, too.  There's got to be.  Yeah.  All right.  What is he?  I say he's a cub because he's got facial hair, but he's too thin to be a bear.  He's a chubby chaser.  A cub?  He's a cub.  And he's too hairy to be a twink.  Yeah, that's no twink, dude.  He's got to get smooth to be a twink.  What's a twink?  Wait a minute, what's a twink?  I want to know what it is.  A twink could be right there as a twink. 
[02:37:30]  That's total twink right there.  So he's a twink?  Yeah, Sam's a twink.  And what does a twink mean?  Twink, kind of youngish looking, smooth hairless kind of thing.  Yeah?  Yeah, like a 14-year-old high school boy, but legal.  Legal.  What about E-Rock behind you there, Kevin?  This is kind of fun.  E-Rock?  He did nothing gay about him.  Oh, wow.  Hey.  I disagree.  He's all man.  Wow.  I don't know.  I don't know what label I would rock on E-Rock.  I would put Doughy.  Doughy? 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  I don't think they have that label in the gay community.  No, they don't.  They're not really into Doughy.  I don't think that'll take off.  Which is weird because there is a whole bear movement, right?  Yeah, yeah.  They're into fat dudes, but you've got to be all or nothing.  Yeah, you're going to be able to fight a grizzly bear to have gay guys like you.  If you can defend them against a fucking bear, I'll fuck you.  With facial hair, he could be a cub.  Maybe.  I would say, no, because that's kind of two, it's like, you know, on magnets, you get two  magnets and they push away from each other.  There's no bear on bear action.  Fat dudes don't want to fuck fat dudes.  What would Nathaniel be with those pretty doll eyes? 
[02:38:30]  Why am I the fucking in charge of this game?  Because you're the one.  Because you stepped up.  I'm really struggling going like, well, what would my gay brethren say?  You stepped up.  We call them fags.  You had all these.  I know a few terms.  A few terms.  And suddenly it's like our expert panel.  You're getting real serious.  And then we're like, wait a minute.  If you can't come up with something, I won't be hurt.  There it is.  They're going to have him on CNN. 
[02:39:00]  So.  All right.  Enough of that.  All right.  So the Dee Dee thing.  We getting her on the line?  Yeah.  She did do a show.  Are you going to criticize her about her show?  Well, we asked her to sit in.  It is a woman, right?  Yeah.  She's a friend of the show.  She used to do the kids channel on XM.  She did like, yeah, XM Kids.  XM Kids.  It's like the Disney channel type of thing.  Kids songs.  Right.  Little cutesy DJs.  And she's got a voice like a cartoon character.  It's really high and she kind of talks like this.  And she got thrown off of that channel the first time she had an appearance on our program 
[02:39:30]  because we made her say inappropriate things with that voice.  With that voice.  And then if people heard it and then heard it on that show.  So she does the traffic reports from various parts of the country on XM.  And she wanted to do a show.  So we said, yeah, what the hell?  It was like Dee Dee's Basement, I think she called it.  And it was just we couldn't quite get out of her before the show what the show was about,  which was kind of a red flag. 
[02:40:00]  And it was apparently about nothing.  Right.  So she just kind of rambled on about things.  Everything from cooking tips to licking Bob Kelly's asshole.  So it really did cover the gamut.  You did that show as well?  No, no.  You get around, dude.  Yeah.  No.  Well, how she wants to.  Well, yeah, here's the deal.  Do you have any movies you're coming up with?  I'm an actor.  Later on this afternoon.  So here's the deal.  Dee Dee wants to do a second show.  And we basically said, look, if you lick Bob Kelly's asshole, we'll give you another show. 
[02:40:30]  Which I don't think.  Can I please, honestly?  I mean, I don't think it's.  I mean, look.  Are you allowed to do it in your relationship?  I would.  First of all, no.  I don't think my girl would let me have another girl lick my asshole.  Not even for shits and giggles?  But it's not even that.  Literally.  It's not even that more so is that my asshole at 36 is so beaten up.  From watching football and itching it.  But that's not your problem.  That's her problem.  Yeah, I know.  But, dude, it's almost like one of those.  You ever see a little shih tzu with that little runny eye? 
[02:41:00]  That's what it is.  You know what I'm saying?  It's just like.  I would just feel.  I don't think.  I don't think another show.  If she ate my ass, you'd have to give her more than just another show.  You'd have to give her.  You'd have to pay her.  This show.  You'd have to give her the bullets for the gun that she'd then put in her mouth and be like,  what the fuck is wrong with me?  It still wouldn't take the taste out either.  If you bought a hamburger from a flea market.  Do you really think I would do that?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I did it.  Yeah. 
[02:41:30]  I was just joking.  Okay.  I think she's got a great radio voice.  I was written because you guys gave me such a hard time Friday.  So I just kind of like, I don't know what I was doing.  We didn't upset you or anything, did we?  Well, I was a little bit pissed, you guys.  Come on now.  Some people, they can't.  The jokes you were making?  Hello?  Yeah.  Well, that wasn't me, DeeDee.  I know because I was ignoring them and talking to you.  I know that, Anthony.  I've always been a huge fan.  How much time did she get? 
[02:42:00]  How much time did you get?  Yeah.  What was the show?  Two hours?  Yeah.  Two hours too long?  Right on.  Did you feel fulfilled, DeeDee, where you're like, this is what I've always wanted to  do?  Well, I've been doing it since 88, so.  So it wasn't fulfilling at all.  She thinks she's better than she really is.  I just went on and just was messing around.  I didn't go on to be serious because I figured, oh, it's just like the news.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So, DeeDee, we asked you to send in what you thought was the highlight of the DeeDee show.  Uh-huh.  DeeDee's basement.  And you sent in a spanking segment.  Yeah, because I got a lot of emails, guys liking that one. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, that would happen.  How many emails would that be?  Two?  No, I got a lot.  Oh, Danny is saying you're full of shit.  I got 100.  Hold on, Danny.  Wow, Danny.  My MySpace account was like, oof.  Why would that mic work?  It's like how she's changing her tune now that the show aired and wasn't so great.  All the time, I was just messing around.  I knew that nothing was ever really going to come of it.  So I just came in and messed around.  Riffed a little bit.  You know, she sent me that email that she decided to just, like, mess around and do 
[02:43:00]  a goop show and not take it seriously.  That's what they call cognitive belief.  Because I figured, what's it calling me?  It's just like the news is not serious, right?  Unless I was wrong, but just put a little bit of help in it.  I don't get it.  Since when is the news not serious?  Does she mean the news on the show or something?  You guys don't do a news segment, do you?  I don't know what she's talking about.  We don't know what she's talking about.  You hear that voice.  Whatever.  Just go ahead and play the audio so you can rip on me.  Aw, I feel bad now.  See, I knew you would say that. 
[02:43:30]  You're losing your edge, sir.  I know.  Dee Dee.  Why?  Kevin Smith will have an open mind.  Hi, Kevin.  Hi, how are you?  Look, I'm already on board because I love the voice.  So let's hear a piece of the show.  Kevin Smith.  Cartoon character.  Yes.  Kevin Smith will critique you.  And you know what?  Oh, shut up.  Wait, I just wanted to say something to Kevin.  Can I please have your permission to say something to Kevin?  You know what?  Just do it.  Don't even ask.  Okay, you're a movie producer guy.  I actually have a movie being produced called Lubricated Immunity about my crazy life. 
[02:44:00]  Right on.  All about you.  I like that.  Make it about you.  She does.  You know, you hear this voice and picture a very innocent girl.  She did at one point have a horrific drinking problem.  Yes, I was.  Where she would black out.  Is this the lubricated part?  Yeah, I guess so.  I guess it sounded interesting for a second.  Yeah, she blacked out.  She wound up marrying a counterfeiter from England.  I had no idea it was married until I woke up the next day in Vegas.  So she wound up in like a Pink Panther movie, essentially.  Yeah.  Pretty much. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, that.  Never even thought of it that way, but exactly.  There you go.  And then another time she ended up, she regained consciousness in a gas station restroom.  In New Orleans.  In New Orleans.  But her night started in Philadelphia.  Sloppy party bottom.  Oh, please.  Sloppy party bottom.  You know you're not in a New Orleans bathroom in a gas station without something having happened  to your ass.  Was this pre or post Katrina?  Bruises all over my arms.  Pre Katrina, yeah.  That's when you can do those sort of things. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, the good old days.  Black out in Philly, wake up in New Orleans, and it's okay.  Now you're just like, can't get a decent glass of water anyway.  Can you imagine what happened to her bottom?  Oof.  Oof.  Oh, she even said oof.  Yeah.  I can't remember.  All right, let's play a little.  Listen to a little of Dee Dee.  This is what you thought was the highlight of your show last Saturday night.  Big Kev will have the open mind here, because, I mean, Kevin Smith.  Well, Big Kev can as well.  Because, yeah, you know what you're going to get from Anthony and I.  I know.  You're going to rip on me. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, shut up.  Here we go.  Hey, Dee Dee.  Hey, Tom.  I'm wondering if there's any chance of Dee Dee getting spanked tonight.  Oh, see, one time when they came to D.C.  O&A and little Jimmy Norton, Jimmy spanked me while I read the news.  Oh, my God.  Mike is taking off his belt.  No.  Hey, what's your name, buddy?  You've been a very bad girl.  Now, you've got to think about this.  No, you really have to.  This girl has these big tits, and I'm a 6'3", bald, black man, just taking advantage of it.  See what I'm saying? 
[02:46:00]  You ready, Dee Dee?  All right.  Come here.  I'm going to wax that ass like rain dance.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  He's not.  Oh, but go gentle, because this is going to hurt.  No, no.  This is staying.  Let's go.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  Dude, you're not leaving that on.  No, no.  I did it first.  Oh, it doesn't fucking matter.  Do it.  That's not going to stop these fucking...  Can you watch me smack that?  Stop it.  No, you need to get the belt.  Yeah.  Stop it, please.  No, no.  You need to get the belt.  Watch.  Nine?  Yeah, nine.  The belt hurt worse.  Watch.  Oh, God.  No, but they used the belt in D.C. 
[02:46:30]  You want them to use a hand or a belt.  Would you just fucking shut up and bend over?  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, he's got a nice flat hand.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, fuck.  Don't go heavy, man.  Nine?  Oh, let it marinate.  Fuck.  It ate that hurt.  It stings.  It stings.  Do we have something for her to bite on and shut the fuck up?  I've got eight more, D.D.  Let's go.  That'll be very nice.  God damn it.  Here, put that in your mouth and bite down.  No, it's...  Oh, fuck.  What the hell is going on on the weekends around here? 
[02:47:00]  Basement of the fucking pawn shop in Pulp Fiction.  Shut the fuck up.  That's a little theater of the mind right there.  Yeah, a little bit.  D.D., did you really get spanked or is that all for sure?  Yeah, ask what's his name.  Yes, Dan Spanny.  Here's the thing.  On the radio, not necessary.  Oh, I got spanked.  No.  You could just pretend to get spanked.  Yeah, you could.  Oh, no.  This was for real.  They could grab like a boar's head thing of turkey and just slap it.  Smack that.  It sounds exactly like it was.  I was really getting spanked.  And just like when they came to D.C., Jimmy Norton really whipped me when I read the news. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, she's got to keep us, but she's way into you guys, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's disgusting.  All right, we got more from her show.  D.D., D.D., you have to say thank you.  You have to say thank you every time you said nothing.  Please, sir, may I have more?  Please, Daddy.  Fuck.  Please, Daddy, give me more.  Thank you.  Please, Daddy, give me more.  She's a potty mouth, too.  Oh, fuck.  Get in.  I know.  Say it again.  Give me more.  That was only three.  Daddy, give me more.  Well, bend over.  Hurry up.  Get it over with.  Oh, fuck, Daddy. 
[02:48:00]  Give me more.  I'm going to chug.  Oh.  Stick it out, D.D.  Stick that ass out.  Get your fucking hands away from your ass and take it like a one.  Yeah, it's supposed to.  That was only four or five, I think.  It's like a bad porno.  Oh, God.  It's making me feel uncomfortable.  Oh, my God.  My ass is going to be red.  It's okay.  Let me get the other side.  It's stings.  It's stings.  It's stings.  I think she's got a catchphrase.  It's stings.  It's stings.  It's stings.  D.D., for your safety, we're never allowing you to do another show on this channel. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, it's best.  That's okay, because I'm doing another show somewhere else.  Oh, snap, sir.  Oh, snap.  Oh, snap.  Excuse me.  You are a stepping stone.  Where are you doing another show?  I can't discuss that yet, but you'll know when you go to my MySpace.  Are you serious?  No, I'm not serious.  J.F.K.?  I can't say.  J.F.K., duh.  I'm not saying yes.  I'm not saying no.  I can't say is what I'm saying.  J.F.K.  How?  They had her on one other time, right, D.D.?  Yeah, I was on for a whole week. 
[02:49:00]  And I didn't do a show like that.  Do you think they'd really put me on if I did a show like that?  I think if they heard that show, they'd take you off.  I think you guys would give me the benefit of the doubt.  I was just fucking around because somebody told me that that's what you wanted because  you weren't serious.  Look, I'm not going to lie to you.  I'm loving the spanking show with D.D.  What?  It's a little scary, but...  My pants would be really sore.  It's a little scary, but it is different.  Like, you could do a whole show, like, different things to spank you with.  And they said to pair me up with one of your pets.  I'm getting a lot of comments.  We want you back with one of the pets.  What do you mean, pair up? 
[02:49:30]  Pair up.  Like, do a show with a pet.  Oh, I thought you meant for some kind of stuff.  No, no, no.  Let's go back to the audio here.  No.  That's right.  Get up here, bitch.  I have to take a breath.  Come on.  I'm going to yell this out.  Ah, ah.  We got a show to do.  Stick your ass out.  Bend over.  Two more.  Two more.  Bend over.  Bend over.  No, that.  Get your hands off your ass.  One more, baby.  Are you ready?  Come on.  No.  One more.  Oh, my God.  Other cheek. 
[02:50:00]  Hey, hey, wait.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Before you do it, cup it to get a better sound.  Okay.  Diddy, I need sound.  Move your hands so I can get some sound at the last one.  I'm here, Diddy.  Or we got to start over.  I'm going to the other side.  No, it's, Diddy.  You got to do the left side because the right's really hurting.  Okay, I'm going to the left side.  Let me get this chair.  Oh, it stings.  Oh, it's, Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[02:50:30]  That's one of my black brothers.  That hurt.  Can I have my belt back?  Oh, God.  I told y'all you're heavy-handed.  That hurt.  I'll say thank you, Diddy.  Okay, thank you.  Great timing.  Okay, bye, Tom.  Thank you, Tom.  Bye.  Oh, God.  Now, sit down.  I can't.  Bullshit, sit down.  It hurts.  Let it marinate.  No, no, no, it hurts.  Enjoy it.  It really, really hurts.  Who's the guy that's being really, like, over-obnoxious?  Yeah, the dudes are scaring the hell out of me. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, the dudes are scaring the hell out of me.  Over-obnoxious.  Who's yelling?  Over-obnoxious.  The one that said, fuck you and just do it?  Yeah.  That would be Young Mike.  Who's that?  Who's Young Mike?  He's a co-worker in traffic and weather.  Has he been convicted of rape?  Yeah.  He's a little too over-the-top, like, fucking scary.  Fucking do it.  Those weather people were always to be avoided.  Yeah.  You know, they read that traffic and weather so well, but deep inside, they're just like,  fucking take it.  Statistically, though, most weather guys are gay.  That's a fact.  What is that? 
[02:51:30]  Sam Champion.  Is there a name for that?  Now, every time you see a gay weatherman.  Wasn't he like a weatherman on ABC or something?  Yeah, yeah.  He always seemed a little gay man.  I just thought his look might have a clever...  Every weatherman now you see now.  It's called Warm Front.  Oh, yes.  Warm Front.  Oh, Warm Front, right.  Sounds like the start of a snuff film.  It's called a mushy front.  This audio's a little creepy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not digging it, really.  Really?  It's not sexy.  It's a little brutal. 
[02:52:00]  It's a little, like, S&M-ish.  Yeah.  Let me...  And, uh, not into that.  She screams too blood-curdling.  The screams are real.  That's why.  Oh, my God.  They were spanking me.  You would scream, too, if you were getting hit that hard.  Don't accuse me of that.  I take it.  And I don't want to hear a guy saying shit like, you know, come on, fucking take it,  bitch.  It's angry.  Yeah.  It's a little too angry.  Yeah, it's a little angry.  Let's go to Martin in, uh, Minnesota.  Martin?  Hey.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  We're on with DeeDee.  I hear ya.  DeeDee. 
[02:52:30]  Hi.  We got to play.  On your next show, here's what you got to do.  You got to tell us what you've put in your pussy, like Francine.  Another show we've done, uh, Kevin.  Uh, we're really setting the radio world on fire.  So, the bar is high.  In my pussy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, uh, Francine did that.  Oh, God.  Okay.  Okay.  How about you, what have you had in your pussy?  Let's start here.  Obviously a dick.  All right.  A dick.  Very good.  Let's see how high it can go here.  Just one.  One.  Um, we want to try to get to ten, and don't lie.  So, so far we got a dick. 
[02:53:00]  What else has been in your pussy?  Sorry, I'm using your bio, uh, Kevin.  Two dicks and a dick.  A what?  What'd she say?  What'd she say?  All right.  Never mind.  Never mind.  Um.  So far just a finger.  A finger, a finger.  Definitely a finger.  A tongue.  Yeah, a finger, yeah.  A tongue, a tongue.  A tongue.  Um, a blah, blah, blah.  Vibrator, vibrator.  Human tongue.  Human tongue.  Wait, what, wait.  So far, what, we got dick, tongue, finger?  Or did you say doll finger?  I said, no, I didn't say doll finger. 
[02:53:30]  I said finger.  Okay, what else?  I said duh, a finger.  Oh, duh, a finger.  All right.  What about, um.  Um, vibrator.  Did I get that?  What kind of vibrator?  There's many kinds, you know.  A rabbit, one of those i-vibes.  Oh, yeah, the rabbit.  Do you ever use a glass dildo?  Oh, the rabbit.  You ever use a glass dildo?  I don't understand those things.  No, I never use a glass dildo.  What was the name?  Because they don't have pores.  What was the name of your dildo?  So what is that?  How is that beneficial?  If somebody already said it, I have the rabbit.  Like, disease and stuff.  Oh, the rabbit.  Disease.  And it works very well.  They get cleaned very well.  The other one's the juice and all the gut gets in them. 
[02:54:00]  You could punch them when it's inside and make it crack in a thousand pieces.  If you're the only person.  Yeah, that seems frightening to me.  If you're the only person using your vibrator, where's all the disease coming from?  Well, if you have a vibrator, you're probably not the only person using this.  Oh, what are you, out of your fucking mind?  You have a vibrator, it means you're, like, instantly at war.  Wow, apparently.  I went to Brazil with a guy who had a bag full of vibrators, and he stuck them in a  lot of people.  Glass dildos.  Yeah, Dr. Dildo, we called him.  He brought a briefcase.  Kevin, he brought a briefcase of glass dildos.  No, it wasn't a briefcase.  It was actually a duffel bag.  Well, he brought it in here. 
[02:54:30]  When we were, a duffel bag, and you could hear him go cling, cling, cling.  He came in here with a briefcase, and it was all laid out.  All glass dildos?  Weapon to the trade, yeah.  Like a hitman.  Yeah, like a hitman.  Butt plugs, whatever he needed for a certain situation.  So if a dude has multiple dildos and whatnot, why does he bother having more than, you  know, this doesn't sound like the kind of dude that's like, well, I don't want these  chicks to catch diseases.  Like, why does he suddenly consider it?  He's like, I'll carry more than one glass dildo.  I don't know.  I think it's just to have the one girl, like, he'll work him with one of the glass dildos, 
[02:55:00]  and then I think it's exciting for him to, like, all right, let me switch it up now  to this one, because I know this one really kind of, he's like an artist, you know?  They don't just have one brush.  Spinning a lot of plates.  It's like being on the old Sullivan show.  Yeah.  Some brushes make the background, some you want a little fine detail.  Yeah.  I guess that's true shading.  Then you have the, he had the vibrators from actually Shopper Image, which, it was just  that big thing with the ball.  Oh, the massager.  And just, I mean, just.  Oh, yeah, the massager.  You'd hear it, like, like you were standing up. 
[02:55:30]  And as it got to the bone, it would go.  And then he'd pull it out.  And I mean, I thought it was nuts, but I, when you make a hooker orgasm, so she cries.  Oh, wow.  Oh, a Brazilian hooker cried in my arms.  I don't know if those tears were pleasure, sir.  Yeah.  No, they were.  She's like, get the sharper image tool out of me.  It's great.  And down in Brazil, they hum, and it's red like blood.  It's amazing. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  It's like a game operation.  Thanks.  But, uh.  Wow.  All right, back to Dee Dee.  What else has been in your pussy?  I already.  We're up to four.  What do we have so far?  Dick, tongue, finger, and vibrator, the rabbit.  The rabbit, yeah.  And that was expensive, okay?  Over a hundred bucks.  All right, like a hundred.  Those vibrators are expensive.  Let's start getting freaky.  Now you can buy them on Amazon.  Isn't that weird?  Think back to 12, 13, 14.  There used to be a time you had to, like, go into a porn shop.  I was pretty good until I hit 18, so I didn't have anything in my pussy until I was about 18. 
[02:56:30]  All right, what else?  Let's get freaky.  What else?  Vegetables.  What about dignity?  Do you ever have any dignity up there?  Jesus, man.  I don't know what you call it, like, one of those tickler things.  A tickler?  Oh, you mean a hairbrush?  A French tickler?  No, they sell it in the sex store.  What does it look like?  It's, like, long.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, my God.  Slim Jim?  What if my mom hears? 
[02:57:00]  Cowtail.  What?  Cowtail?  A cat of nine tails.  A cat of nine...  Well, I don't know.  I always thought it was, like, a tickler thing, because it felt really good.  All right, we'll call it the...  A midget fist.  We'll call it the tickler thing.  I've never had a midget fist.  We got a cookie.  We had that, you know, that girl in high school that everybody had in high school, cookie puss,  where allegedly put a cookie in her pussy.  I had a cookie.  I never did a cookie.  Mine was a frozen hot dog.  So what was her name?  Coney Island?  Oh, she was just a fat...  They were always fat, too. 
[02:57:30]  You never...  Every chick that had something break off from her pussy as a kid, she was fat.  Remember a hot chick that had a hot dog that broke in her pussy.  All right, what else, DeeDee?  We got to get to ten.  To ten?  I can't...  I don't think I have ten.  Gear shift knob after some Spanish fly.  What?  Since we're just delving into other myths.  I forgot that story.  That was always a good one.  Dude, she ended up on the fucking gear shift.  Took a little Spanish fly.  She couldn't get it.  Couldn't get enough.  That's it.  Couldn't get enough.  Dude, found her the next day on the doorknob. 
[02:58:00]  You know what?  Now those chicks exist on the internet.  Yeah.  What used to be urban legend, now it can just be easily found.  Internet stories.  Just Google, like, fucking a gear shift.  And boom, you'll picture.  You'll get the stories.  Or the other one, which we loved.  It was one of the first real passed-around spam sex stories.  It was fake.  Stop.  And it was...  It started out, in hindsight, lighting the match was a bad idea.  Yeah.  I remember that first sentence, because people would fax this to us back in the old days,  like, just like it was the most amazing story, and they were the first ones that were going 
[02:58:30]  to show us.  And we've seen it a thousand times.  We had talked about it, and still, dude, you've got to check this story out.  It's unbelievable.  And it was literally unbelievable.  Two guys end up at the hospital.  One has burns to his face.  The other one has burns...  And a broken nose.  And a broken nose.  The other one has burns to his ass and inside his rectum.  And they were trying to explain it, and the story came out that they were doing the little 
[02:59:00]  trick, the Richard Gere, the little tube, the toilet paper tube, and the mouse.  Stuck the mouse up the other guy's ass, and there was a string tied around the mouse's  tail or leg that had come off.  That's how you get the mouse out.  Right.  And now they couldn't find the mouse in his ass, so the other guy's poking around trying  to get it out, so it was so dark in there that he lit a lighter to look in his ass.  Right. 
[02:59:30]  Lighting the methane gas from his ass, firing the mouse out, the flaming mouse, like a cannon  ball out of this man's ass, smashing flames and a mouse into the guy's nose, breaking his  nose, burning his face, burning his buddy's asshole and buttocks, and that's what happened.  That's the story.  It's like eight kinds of unbelievable.  It's so urban myth.  How can a mouse, even going at the speed of light, break your nose, break your nose.  We've got to get myth busters on this.  Yeah, why doesn't myth busters ever come in that one? 
[03:00:00]  They've run out of ideas.  There's one for you.  Do that one.  But the story would come in, and they'd have AP as part of the story, so it's AP.  It's got to be true.  And it actually was written from the point of view of a surgeon that worked on these two  guys giving a press conference.  Right.  So, he's outside of the hospital.  I just picture the podium, the microphones, and him talking about the mouse in the guy's  ass, fired out with the methane.  Ladies and gentlemen, I've hit the bottom of the barrel.  Yeah. 
[03:00:30]  Here is my story.  Right.  It just, and we knew it never happened, but we would get it every day.  In hindsight, lighting the match was a bad idea.  That's a good idea, yeah.  And just like, dude, it's real.  It happened, because I know the guy that took the guy to the hospital.  You'd have to be leaking like an oil rig.  Oh, I know.  Lighting a lighter to somebody.  Yeah.  You can't just.  I thought the story was going to be like, we couldn't get the mouse out, so we decided  to burn it out.  Burn it out.  Burn it out.  Like a witch.  Villagers came over with torches and pitchforks. 
[03:01:00]  Burn the witch.  All right, Dee Dee, you came up with another one?  I have another one.  All right, go ahead.  I was dating this guy for a while with a foot fetish.  Uh-oh.  So you had toe in your pussy?  Mm-hmm.  I've done that.  That's actually kind of hot.  I did that with an agent.  It is hot.  Yeah, they call it shrimping.  No, it's toe in the pussy?  Yeah, you hook your toe like a shrimp, and you stick it in a pussy.  It's like noodling.  So that's six.  The fishing.  I don't know, like, what else?  I can't figure it out. 
[03:01:30]  You're done at six?  I think about six things.  You've got to have some real well-clipped toenails.  No, no, no, no.  What about a vase?  Like one of mom's vases?  A vase?  No.  Anything in your younger days?  Maybe a...  Remember tickle deodorant?  The old tickle bottle when it first came out, and you went, ah-ha.  There was something laying around.  Remember the Breck shampoo bottle that was shaped like a cock?  I've never done it with a shampoo bottle.  No?  But...  Banana?  Banana?  Cucumber?  No, banana.  Here comes one, though.  She remembered something.  Go ahead, Dee Dee. 
[03:02:00]  Number seven.  I'm telling you, I can't think of any more.  You said butt, like you had another one.  No.  Oh, also, they went up her butt, maybe.  Yeah, she's like, never mind.  Just double that.  I've only had six things in my pussy, but my ass?  28.  And here they come alphabetically.  That's about my ass, dude.  There's not enough time in the day.  I actually had a guy do karaoke for my asshole one night.  That's just Bobby.  Did you do any of the ass play, Dee Dee, ever? 
[03:02:30]  You know I've taken trips to Greece before.  We've talked about this before.  Oh, okay.  Well, if you've been to Greece, you've taken a dick in the ass.  Why do they like it?  It's the law.  You get in there.  Were you literally to Greece, or was that a cute euphemism?  See, it's a saying that I found out a long time ago, okay, this guy said, hey, want to  take a trip to Greece?  I thought, wow, he must really love me.  He wants to take me to Athens, and then I found out what that really means.  I suspect it.  It's a cute euphemism.  Yeah.  When did you realize you weren't going to Greece?  When I was 21.  No. 
[03:03:00]  What part of the act?  When he went to the Greece himself.  Wait a minute.  We're not going to Athens.  No, he said it could be.  Oh, shit, Sherlock.  That's not what that means.  This is what it is.  And I'm like, oh, okay.  At least he was polite enough to say and not, you know, demonstrate.  He got a blowjob in the mezzanine of the Broadway production of Greece.  You want to go to Greece?  All right, thank you.  Where can I send my proposal for Pest Radio?  You guys send it in to steve at foundrymusic.com.  All right, DeeDee, we'll be in touch, all right?  Okay, bye.  Yeah, we want to give the O&A Pest now. 
[03:03:30]  We'll be in touch, that old gag.  On the channel.  Yeah, the Pest is going to show.  So, where do you think she's really, do you think she's really getting a job?  Here?  No, JFK or whatever.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  She was doing so good on that goddamn kid channel.  She got the voice.  She was perfect for it.  She knows all the little cutie little kid songs.  What happened?  She had a nice...  Well, she came on our show and started talking about getting fucked in the ass.  What do you think, Bob?  With that voice.  That usually doesn't fly.  That voice goes over great.  She got a better job?  It doesn't fly with Disney.  That voice goes over great. 
[03:04:00]  Wait a minute.  She was on a Disney channel?  It might as well be.  It was called XM Kids.  You have your little eight-year-old call up and request a silly song.  And you knew that.  And she was a DJ.  Yeah.  And of course you knew that.  With the cute, cartoony voice.  What little kid would love that voice?  You want to go to Greece?  Yeah.  We're going to go to Greece.  I think we really fucked...  You want to be a party sloppy bottom?  We fucked up her gig.  Sloppy party bottom.  Well, now you're responsible to give her a job.  Yeah, we kind of are.  All right.  We're a little obligated here.  Kevin Smith is here.  We got an update on the Hold Your Wee for Wee. 
[03:04:30]  How the news is reporting it today.  It's kind of funny.  Maybe we'll play...  Kind of funny?  I was on the front page of AOL yesterday?  This morning, actually.  No.  Well, late last night.  Yeah.  4.30 in the morning.  Well, what's funny about it...  We'll get into it next.  They give the latest facts and they talk about how sad it is and how tragic.  And then they go, oh, well...  Anyway, check of the weather.  Oh, they kind of do the move on.  We love the segues.  We love the Neuro segues.  The kids did get the game system, though, after all, right?  That's what I heard.  She came in second. 
[03:05:00]  I think...  I heard the latest update was they actually threw them away.  Why would you give the kid away?  At that point...  It's just going to remind...  At that point, even the kid doesn't want it anymore.  You're just going to remember, you know, your mom died trying to win.  Who knew that you could die from not pissing?  The woman that called in and warned them not to do the contest?  Get out of here.  The nurse?  Yeah, we got...  You know.  Even the jocks had talked about it.  That's kind of...  I think everyone knew.  Those triathlete guys know that.  And how long was it?  You got to debrief me on the whole thing. 
[03:05:30]  She was in there for about three hours, I think.  I've not pissed for three hours and not died.  Yeah.  Kevin, I should say.  Yes, sir.  Two gallons of water.  Here's the clip.  Eva.  Eva?  Yes.  What do you want to say?  I want to say that those people that are drinking all that water can get sick and possibly die from water intoxication.  Yeah, we're aware of that.  They sign releases, so we're not responsible.  It's okay.  And if they get to the point where they have to throw up, then they're going to throw up  and they're out of the contest before they die. 
[03:06:00]  So that's good, right?  Oh, that's me.  I suppose so.  Yeah.  All right.  How come you guys didn't do it?  Thanks for looking out, though.  We don't want to die.  Oh, okay.  Let me ask Carter if anybody's dying.  We ain't dying.  Hey, Carter, is anybody dying in there?  We got a guy that's just about to die.  Oh, good.  Make sure that we laugh at that.  Oh, my God.  Oh, in hindsight, I'm sure they don't.  What's the matter with Nick Lewis?  Jocks anymore, man.  Can't they just send people to fucking St. Patch?  Fuck in the cathedral?  Why do they have to be this?  Why do they have to lower the voice?  Why kill the listeners? 
[03:06:30]  Can they go see Greece and St. Patch?  That's not good radio right there.  Kevin, this is the safe radio, too.  That's terrestrial?  No, this is morning zoo crap.  They do this the whole time.  Yeah, they're not shock jocks.  They're not shock jocks.  They're just wacky.  They go into this.  So, like, after this, they went to Mr. Leonard for a traffic report?  Exactly, yeah.  It was one of those shows.  They go into these bits.  They don't think there's going to be any problem, real problem.  Right.  It's just silly radio, you know?  Ten people got fired.  Well, I mean, like, seriously, though.  You have somebody call up and say, even if someone says someone can get sick off that, 
[03:07:00]  you're like, it's water.  It's water.  Let me tell you something also.  So, what we do, whenever there's any risk of anything, we have EMTs that come in and  stay for the entire show.  We had them with the eggnog drinking contest.  Granted, they're drunk, but whatever.  Of course.  Aren't they all?  Did this girl go home?  At least they're there.  Did she go home?  She went home, laid down in a bed where she was found a few hours later.  So, she's in studio, and were they forcing them to drink a lot of water or something?  Yeah, they had to drink a lot of water.  It was, she had two gallons in her, and not pee. 
[03:07:30]  She started talking about how, you know, her head was hurting, and she didn't feel good.  They commented on how bad she looked.  Fuck it.  Let's play the audio again.  Yeah, I know.  You want to hear, Kevin, this is creepy.  So, they talked to Jennifer.  They tried to get her to drop out, because it gets, the contest's going on too long,  and they got to get to their trap.  Not out of concern.  Yeah, believe me.  Not out of concern for her.  She got their battle of the sexes or something.  They're loony tune, they got to play that day. 
[03:08:00]  If she would have only taken Justin Timberlake tickets, she might still be alive.  So, that was the second prize, the runner-up?  They offered her.  Kevin, you're going to hear the voice of the girl that ends up dying, right?  That girl voice.  She had a decision to make right here, and she made the wrong decision.  Listen to this.  It would have maybe saved her life.  Who is this, Jennifer?  This is Jennifer.  Jennifer, what's the situation about Justin Timberlake tonight?  I don't want to, I want the we.  You do want the we.  I was tempted.  I was really, really tempted, and everyone's going to hate me forever. 
[03:08:30]  I got a pair of tickets, lower level, Justin Timberlake, 2007 Future Sex Love Show Live,  Arco Arena tonight.  And I will throw them away if you do not want to take them.  Or Lucy.  I'm going to throw them away.  What?  We're not, trust me, we're not going to throw them away.  I'm going to take them.  I'm going to have to say, God, this really sucks.  Say yes.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  She said yes.  She lives. 
[03:09:00]  That's creepy.  How ironic that she literally says, I want the we.  Yeah.  And if she had just taken the we.  Take the we.  She'd be alive today.  She would have bailed, and maybe she's going to start leaking stuff.  That is, that's, you know, I guess that'll be top winner in the Darwin Awards next year.  Yeah.  The first thing you do when you die, what's the first thing you do when you die?  You wet yourself.  You piss your pants out.  Wow.  Yeah.  All the bottle of fluids go.  That's a lot, God.  Right when she died, it came out.  And could you imagine, like, people probably weren't sure she was dead because she just kept  pissing.  Oh.  Like, two gallons of piss as the body releases everything. 
[03:09:30]  It's just like, man.  Well, so her voice is pretty happy there, right?  Very.  All right.  The contest continued.  Jennifer, I heard that it's not, you're not doing too well.  My head hurts.  Hear the big difference?  My head hurts.  It happens when your brain swells up inside a fucking skull, has no real breathing room  in a skull.  I have a real tough time listening to this.  It's just, it's just.  Where do you stand on it?  Are you, do you.  With what?  In terms of, you got a point a finger. 
[03:10:00]  Do you point a finger?  Are you just like, well, you know, it's tragic circumstances, or are you coming down on the  DJs, or are you coming down on the chick?  It's really tragic.  I don't know.  They gave her a choice.  I look at this like a fucking traffic accident fatality.  It's something no one plans on.  Yeah, the traffic accidents are usually accidents.  This was no accident.  Perhaps.  This was not a boating accident.  It's not a boating accident.  Perhaps the one driver was driving a bit erratically, and it caused the accident, but didn't intend  to cause an accident, just was trying to get home a little quicker, or was on the cell 
[03:10:30]  phone.  It just sounds, the insidious part, though, is, I mean, it's all in retrospect, right?  Yeah.  Hindsight's 20-20.  Listening to those dudes go.  They signed releases, so.  Yeah, we don't care.  We don't care.  It's actually, yeah, more of a, are we legally safe?  All right, fuck her.  All right.  That's pretty much it.  There's not one person in that room thinking that this person could actually die.  Like, again, though, if she was drinking oil, you know, from, you know, out of a car, that  would be like, this could be bad.  Right.  She's drinking water, so nobody's thinking that this, every, even when that person said 
[03:11:00]  to you, you say, yeah, whatever, how do you get sick of water?  Yeah.  It was a total accident.  I can't stress enough, they do these type of things on morning zoos all the time, you  know, sit on a block of ice, the last person up wins a dump ticket.  She's a small girl, and like I said, it'll come out, you know, in the autopsy, did she,  was she fasting to try to fit more water all night?  Did she eat breakfast and get like those chemicals that the water kind of dilutes that you need?  Was she pulling a Kobayashi?  Yeah, doing a Kobayashi, just like stretch your stomach out and then not eat for the day. 
[03:11:30]  Is that a Kobayashi?  Well, that's the winner of the Coney Island hot dog contest, eating every year, Kobayashi.  A little thin Asian.  What is, and what's the, what's the exercise?  He will, will months in advance, start slowly stretching his stomach out.  So he goes in and to these sushi places and just eats stacks, plates, plates will be stacked  up, 10 stacks, like five feet high.  You know what else they do though?  They eat grapes because they'll, they'll just bowl of grapes and just pop them, boom, 
[03:12:00]  boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, like this.  And it stretches your stomach out.  And then he stretches, stretches, stretches, and then before, uh, hand, right before the  competition, he'll fast a bit and he'll have this big stretched out stomach and he can  just shove fucking hot dog stomach.  I don't understand, isn't stretching your stomach getting fat?  Isn't that the whole, no, he's very thin.  He's stretching, and he works out too.  The reason why skinny people, uh, fat people can't eat as much as a skinny person. 
[03:12:30]  I used to work at a, uh, an Italian restaurant that gave a pound of pasta with every meal and  there was one meal called a pound of pasta with every meal, line out the door, line out  the door every day, every day for five bucks still like five 99, a pound of pasta with every  meal, but they, they had a, um, a miso de pesci, two and a half pounds of pasta.  And I think like something like a pound of seafood or some shit, you know, just crazy amount.  But if you ate that, you got a free t-shirt and the only people that finished it. 
[03:13:00]  It was skinny dudes.  There's a couple of people that finished it because there's the fat people have so much  fat pushing against their stomach that it can't expand.  Skinny guys don't have really any fat in there to push it.  So it can expand more than a fat person.  I don't know if I agree with that.  I can kill a lot of fucking food though.  I can, I can, I can, I'm not denying, I'm sure in some cases, I can, I can eat everybody  in this room.  Yeah, it's true.  I'm sorry.  I'll give it up to the PHX.  I have the mic in front of him. 
[03:13:30]  It's gotta be true.  If comedy doesn't work out, I'm going to fucking be, I'm going to be a dumpling champion.  You could be a spokesperson on MSNBC.  All right, here we go.  So here's the audio as Jennifer's a lot different now.  Jennifer, I heard that it's not, you're not doing too well.  My head hurts.  They keep telling me that it's the water that it's my, it'll tell my head to hurt and then  it'll make me puke, but.  We told you that the head hurts.  I'm just a giddiness.  Yeah.  That's one of those over there.  It kind of, it makes you, it hurts, but it makes you feel lightheaded.  So I'm not sure if I'm just like. 
[03:14:00]  This is what it feels like when you're drowning.  There's a lot of water inside of you.  Oh, it hurts.  This is like deep blue sea.  So we want to get you out of your misery.  We would like to offer you again, one more time.  And the last time.  The last time we're going to offer you this, Justin Timberlake tickets for tonight.  Lower level.  Because it seems like Lucy has a big bladder and she's not going anywhere.  You know, they laughed at me for turning them down the first time, so I'm not going to  turn them down again.  I'll take them.  Oh!  Well, she took tickets. 
[03:14:30]  All right, bring them in.  Hey, bring everybody in.  Two empty seats.  But why'd she die?  The other two.  If she got the tickets, why did she just go pee right there?  Oh, that was a good seat.  Can we move down there?  It's too late.  There's a point that's too late.  Where is this?  That's what I'm thinking.  Uh, Sacramento.  So even if she must have went and pissed right after that.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  Too much water was absorbed into her system already.  So you're just done.  There's a point of no return.  No one fucking knew that water could kill you unless you were drowning in it.  Isn't it really amazing?  Why is this the fundamental building block of all life, isn't it? 
[03:15:00]  Apparently, though, there's a few other chemicals thrown in that if you dilute too much, you  will die.  Your blood turns to water.  We were talking about...  No, it doesn't.  No, it doesn't.  We were talking about this.  It sounded great, didn't it?  It sounded great, didn't it?  I bought it because I was buying the bad guys to do the water.  Did I just say, though, you guys all bought it for a half a second?  We were talking about this the other day.  What is this?  Boulder Nash?  And it turned into this whole thing on life and God and all this other crap because you're  like, how the fuck do these piles of goop that we are, we're just fucking goop, walk 
[03:15:30]  and talk and communicate and build things and do things when, you know, it's just this chemical  surrounding, you know, a brain cell.  And it's got, like, sodium in there and electrolytes and everything it needs to keep the cell alive.  Just bobbing along.  Yeah, and it's bobbing away and that's what keeps it alive.  It's a cell that's holding a little memory of fucking, you know, of pulling a wagon when  you're six and that's its purpose, forever, is just to keep that image of you pulling 
[03:16:00]  a wagon.  Remember you're Stephen Hawking's right now, just the way you jack it on, you're leaning  in your chair.  Oh, I love it.  I don't think anyone's pulled a wagon, sir, since, like, 1868.  Exactly.  I didn't mean, like, a covered one going west.  Not even that.  A radio flyer, no?  A little red wagon growing up?  A little red radio flyer?  He's a vampire.  We don't know how old he really is.  I've been around for many years.  Many centuries.  It was, uh, yeah, okay.  Uh, your first car.  Buying your first car.  There it is.  But if you drink too much water.  Yeah, that's a Model T, you fuck.  I had a Gran Torino, and you had to get in the passenger side door. 
[03:16:30]  See?  And when you turn the lights on, it started.  That's in a brain cell somewhere.  I'm not kidding.  That's somewhere in a brain cell.  I used to have, in the wintertime, I used to have the girl, any girl I was on a date  with, she'd have to connect two wires to turn the heat on.  It was nipples.  Easy.  And now there's a cell in my head, a little blob of water that's holding this information  about don't drink too much water.  Yeah, now that's in there.  Wouldn't that be ironic?  Really, you can drink too much water, but don't, don't not pee, for heaven's sake.  Take a leak, ladies and gentlemen. 
[03:17:00]  Okay, you need sodium, you need electrolytes.  Like, if you did that with Gatorade, it wouldn't matter.  Fine, supposedly.  Get the fuck out of here.  She drank two gallons of Gatorade.  Yeah, you'd be fine.  We're not experts.  Because it's got, it's got the chemicals in it that you're diluting out with the water.  And then your, your cells, the brain cells, start swelling.  Because they, they're not getting what they need, so they start swelling.  And, you know, a cell at a time swells, doesn't seem like that much.  You pack them all together into a brain, into that fucking bread pan skull, without the 
[03:17:30]  top to fucking expand.  The water does, I don't know, I'm saying this because the only channels I watch is, is  Discovery and A&E.  Yeah.  It does something to your blood, too.  It does, it does.  It turns it into water.  You're still campaigning for the whole thing.  You are really fucking going for this.  All right, listen.  Can I jump back?  Jesus.  I am something of a medical expert.  And, uh, I saw an A&E.  I just want to let you know.  Between episodes of City Confidential, that, uh, water.  Dr. Kelly.  Dr. Kelly.  And Crossing Jordan. 
[03:18:00]  One more piece of audio to play.  The host comment on how sick Jennifer looks.  And so the whole time she's there in studio?  Yeah.  Well, I think they set up another area, and then they finally brought it back in the studio.  They had, like, a staging area somewhere else.  Oh, she looks sick.  Jennifer, you look pregnant.  Oh, my gosh, look at her belly.  Are you pregnant?  No.  She said it looks like her belly, like, when she was pregnant.  Look, it's totally sticking out.  Oh, my gosh.  Look at that belly.  That is so funny.  That's full of water. 
[03:18:30]  You were probably three months pregnant.  Come on over.  She's a mother of three.  I know.  She's a little tiny thing, too.  That's so funny.  Come on over, Jennifer.  Are you okay?  You want to lay down?  What are you...  She can't even walk.  Are you going to pass out right now?  Too much water?  I could probably drink more if you guys could pick me up.  What can I get for another?  What can I get?  Well, you're going to Justin Timberlake tonight.  You got tickets for that.  I don't think Lucy was going to give up.  See, if there were EMTs there, they would have seen what kind of shape she was in, taking 
[03:19:00]  her vitals and gone, look, you got to get to the hospital.  But you said that by that point she was already too late.  There's things they could do.  It's too late if you go home and go to sleep.  You can't take a leak and then go home and go to sleep.  But if you go to the hospital, they...  You're not getting mad at me like I'm the chick who drank the water.  Look, you motherfucker.  I'm telling you, man.  Like, 60 years ago, they would drag people away in cattle cars, gas them, and then burn  them.  The new Reich, the fourth Reich.  Fourth Reich.  Morning radio.  Drink all this water and don't piss.  We don't care.  Yeah.  She's just doing it one person at a time. 
[03:19:30]  Exactly.  Well, here's where the case is at.  Brand new info.  We think that they went ahead and did this contest inappropriately and irresponsibly.  And that's why lawyers for Jennifer Strange's family say they plan to file a wrongful death  lawsuit against the Sacramento station.  The attorneys claim KD&D-FM knew the dangers of a water drinking contest, even joked about  them on the air, but continued anyway.  Everything that we've been able to generate so far in our investigation demonstrates that 
[03:20:00]  they just didn't pay attention or even take the time to investigate or research what was  the potential consequence of this contest.  It's so easy to condemn in retrospect, though.  Never in a million fucking years would these dudes be that up in arms if they called them  in advance and said, hey, we're going to have a contest where you make people drink a  lot of water and they can't go to the bathroom.  How harmful could that be?  And what happened to the guy that won first place?  He obviously drank two gallons of water and didn't piss either.  It was a woman who won. 
[03:20:30]  A woman who won.  How far?  You think that woman's sitting around going, like, it could have been me?  Yeah.  Yeah, and it's for a weed, too.  I will never drink water again.  So she'll sue.  How much does she hate her children?  Oh, my God, really?  The one who won is just like, I fucking put my life on the line.  You better play that game.  Play the game.  Fuck your homework.  I almost died for that.  Yeah, she won.  It wasn't even a Sony.  It was a Wii.  Yeah.  A lot of the Wiis are pretty popular.  Don't diss the Wii with a fan of the Wii.  I don't like the Wii.  You like the Wii?  The Wii's pretty popular.  I don't like the Wii.  It might be worth taking a shot for. 
[03:21:00]  Stupid hand controller.  We're up to a law professor.  All right.  We've got a law professor.  There we go.  This is what they're thinking as far as a lawsuit goes.  We have the bizarre case of a California mother of three who died from drinking too much water  at a contest sponsored by a radio station.  The question now was, is that the homicide and will anyone be held criminally responsible?  ABC senior law and justice correspondent Jim Avala has the following story.  So, is encouraging listeners to drink as much as two gallons of water without using the bathroom 
[03:21:30]  dangerous enough to be a criminal offense?  UCLA law professor Peter Aranella.  The behavior of the radio station, as well as the disc jockeys, is so egregious that a criminal  prosecution would not be a frivolous expense of state resources.  Two factors make criminal prosecution possible, says Aranella.  First, another contestant says he didn't see any warning of possible health dangers.  I got the waiver or the release form by looking at it.  Nothing to say that this could be harmful to your health or properly deadly. 
[03:22:00]  And secondly, the disc jockeys were warned on the air that what they were doing was hazardous.  Those people that are drinking all that water can get sick and possibly die from water intoxication.  Yeah, we're aware of that.  Yeah, they signed releases, so we're not responsible.  It's okay.  We're not responsible.  Yeah.  An understatement.  I was just kidding.  He was just kidding.  Murder charges, though?  You know he was just kidding.  Murder charges, Kevin?  Not murder.  No.  I mean, you know, it's tragic and sad, but like, come on, that's just a blunder. 
[03:22:30]  Civil case there will be, obviously.  Sure, I have to sue the station, whatever, criminal, get some recompense.  They're going to have every Wii that comes out from now until they're like 80.  I don't think you can make a criminal case out of it.  You think Nintendo's just like, we had nothing to do with it?  Oh, Nintendo's going to do it.  They want to change the name of it, for heaven's sake.  They're going to sue.  They're going to sue everybody.  They're going to piss now.  It's so easy, though, in retrospect, where we can get all tight about it and like, oh, 
[03:23:00]  this was a fucking horrible train wreck.  I bet your Wii sales are up.  Yeah.  You think so?  It's worth dying for.  That's how they've got to market it.  The video game system, that's worth dying for.  But that's how it works in America.  I mean, there's a lot of attention for the Wii.  It's got a lot of mention.  I bet your sales are up.  Somewhere in the bowels of Nintendo, there's somebody sitting in an office going, I don't  know, this is good for us.  Yeah, absolutely.  That's horrible.  Listen for the segue.  Grab that dude, Jason, man.  He says blood cells burst.  He's like four, line four.  From Brentwood.  Jason, yes.  Dr. Jason, yes. 
[03:23:30]  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  What's going on?  Yeah, I want to support Bob's idea, what happens to your blood.  Thank you.  Like, when you get too much blood.  Can you call me Dr. Bob, though?  Yeah.  Oh, Dr. Bob.  I'm sorry.  It's okay, doctor.  What are your credentials, sir?  I really don't have any.  I'm just a smart guy.  All right.  All right.  I'll take it.  I'll take it.  That's good enough.  My name is Nathaniel.  I have a phone in front of my face.  No better than anyone else in this room, though.  He has a phone in front of his face.  Okay. 
[03:24:00]  All right, doctor.  What happens is you dilute out the blood.  You get a lot of water in there, so the osmosis reverses, so you get a lot of water going into  the blood cells, so they burst, and then you run out of oxygen, so you actually suffocate.  That's what happens.  That's what I said.  The osmosis reverses.  The osmosis reverses.  I was trying to say.  Thank you, doctor.  You're out of your mind.  Dr. Jason, thank you.  Dr. Bob says, thank you.  Dr. Steve from Scranton, PA, O&A, new bit for you.  Hold your P for a PSP. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, the PSP.  Huh?  Let's run it past the lawyers.  Yeah, right.  Listen for the segue here.  Judy Linder is a nurse at a Sacramento clinic who convinced her friend to call with that  message.  I was more concerned as they were drinking more and asking people to drink more, and it  was 8 o'clock in the morning at that time.  They would have had plenty of time to stop them.  Now, the Sheriff's Department is investigating possible criminal charges, and while difficult 
[03:25:00]  to prove, intent to kill, most legal experts we surveyed believe a charge of manslaughter  is possible because the radio station should have known drinking too much water too quickly  can, in fact, be lethal.  Why should they have known?  In fact, they were warned about that.  Yeah.  It's a tragedy.  It's so sad.  All right, Jim.  Thank you.  Appreciate that.  Now, 36 minutes after the hour, get a check of the weather again with Sam Champion.  That's how important your life is in the end.  Speaking of water, it's going to be wet in the city today.  A lot of rain coming down. 
[03:25:30]  Why should a fucking radio station have known that?  No.  It's not their responsibility to know, like, we're fucking drinking too much water.  Are you supposed to take the word of a caller just coming out of nowhere?  That's the thing.  The other thing, too.  Some dude calling out.  And what about this chick going like, you know, I told my friend to call up because I  knew it was lethal.  Then get off your fat fucking ass.  Go down to the radio station and fucking bang the door down and be like, yeah.  Be a hero.  Totally.  Be fucking Superman.  Superman don't pick up a phone and it's like, hey, you know, there's a meteor hurling toward  the city.  Somebody do something about it. 
[03:26:00]  Could you call them up and tell them because I'm lazy.  Can we play our interview from last night one more time?  Oh, please.  We got involved in this.  Where?  Well, we're experts at shockery.  We're fired from our shockery.  Our shockification of people that we have done with our shock jockage.  Who knew getting laid in a confessional would kill you?  Exactly.  Thank God. 
[03:26:30]  Getting laid.  You fucking broke a commandment.  We've had a lot of people arrested.  Were they fucking in the ass?  Not killed.  Yeah.  A little ass sex.  Oh, there's a rumor.  A rumor.  Who knows?  No, we weren't there.  Since we're the poster boys for shit like this.  I have a question about that story.  So that was you guys going, like, just go anywhere weird and do it.  You didn't say go to St. Patrick's?  No, we had a list.  Was St. Patrick's on that list?  No.  Church was.  Church was on it.  Right on.  But Church was on there because there were a lot of locations that are easy to have sex in. 
[03:27:00]  Right.  We had known that from the years that we had done the thing, nooks and crannies.  You could go to, one was the Hard Rock.  Hard Rock Cafe.  A little landmark in New York.  You could get into a booth in a corner somewhere.  We just knew it was easy to slip it in, slip it out.  You get the points.  And then we figured having Church on the list would be, as we read the list, it would sound like, oh my God, there's Church is on the list.  Not thinking anyone's really going to go there, but to have it on the list is kind of outrageous and shocking. 
[03:27:30]  So we just didn't know until we plunked the phone down and one of the guys, a spotter, was on there and says, hey, we're here at St. Pat's and he's doing the balloon knot, which was our code for ass sex.  It wasn't even like, hello, where are you?  What's going on?  It was like, boom, boom, that.  And he goes, all right, they're pulling their pants up.  Security guard is coming over.  It happened that quickly.  Right.  I think it could have been diffused if they all just fucking ran away. 
[03:28:00]  If they all just ran.  But Paul Mercurio, who was a comic at the time.  Why couldn't they, they were in a church.  Why didn't they just claim sanctuary?  Sanctuary!  Didn't the cop actually say, get the hell out of here?  Yeah, get out of here at one point.  They didn't want to do it.  There were many opportunities.  It was a guard, actually, not a cop.  The great irony is that it just said church on your list.  Had they done this in a church of Satan?  None of these problems.  Right.  Actually, they'd be carried out.  Why'd they have to be a Catholic?  That's the only problem.  You can go to Unitarian.  They'd let you get away with the Unitarian church.  They're not sure what they believe.  And like, the numero uno Catholic church. 
[03:28:30]  Like, that is the Catholic church.  So, you know, of course, took a lot of heat.  And we become the poster child for this type of shit.  When it happens, people want to know what our opinion is.  Heats off you guys.  You guys look mild in comparison.  Nobody died.  What's that?  Can we just get this story?  I don't mean to interrupt you again, and I apologize.  But they want to ban spanking?  And make it a fine?  A thousand dollar fine or something?  Spank your kid?  But they want to actually ban it.  Make it against the law.  A crime. 
[03:29:00]  All right.  Right on.  I thought a small child was going to come in and explain that.  Did you shush me?  Wow.  Fuck what is going on.  Are you insane?  The fuck kind of people are they?  You're like a crazy person.  I thought you said, shush me, spider.  I thought you said, shush me, spider.  I thought you said, what the hell's wrong with you?  So the news wants us to comment on this.  Yes.  Now, when we got fired, every fucking shock jock douchebag, second rate radio ass was on commenting on our career.  I remember waking up Sunday morning and just hitting some of the talk shows on the news and laying there in bed and thinking how surreal this was that they're discussing my life and my career and how I'm blackballed and I'm never going to work again. 
[03:29:30]  And as I'm just waking up, like, what the, why?  Who the fuck are you?  How do you know?  So it kind of was like, all right, MSNBC called us up and wanted us to do this interview.  And I'm thinking it's so hypocritical almost for us to now then go on and go, well, even if we defend him, it's kind of stupid. 
[03:30:00]  You know, what the, what the fuck do we know?  And who cares what we think?  You know, so we said yes.  And with the idea, and we even did it on the air yesterday, we were coming up with thoughts and everything of just throwing in every little inside joke that this show has into her interview.  Right.  Instead of doing a real interview.  Opie played good cop trying to keep her on the hook by actually answering some of the questions. 
[03:30:30]  How one of these experts would answer.  And all I did with every statement was throw an inside joke in from this show.  Mentioned people's names, mentioned Steve's bad acting that he did for one of his promos.  Just every little inside joke.  And it worked out well.  And he brought up a case, a very important case.  Oh, yes.  Of a radio show going, you know, doing something wrong.  The names of the radio jocks I use are, one of them is a name that Jimmy uses as one of his 
[03:31:00]  characters when he calls up and just insults callers that call in for interviews.  Another one is just the sound that Jimmy makes.  What is it?  Frankus.  So you put the two together and it's a show called Ramon and Ramon and Frankus show.  And I described how they had killed somebody by doing something we did on the show that day.  Right.  And she was pissed.  You could hear it.  She didn't want to talk to me anymore.  She kept going, well, Opie, Opie. 
[03:31:30]  And I just kept chiming in with ridiculous things that made no sense.  And halfway through, Anthony made me laugh so hard.  I'm holding the phone like this, like, don't blow it.  You know, I got to play the good cop here.  And then.  Oh, it tripped him up so bad.  He was trying not to laugh.  And then she asked some kind of question.  I remember a couple words.  And so now my brain's trying to, like, work out something from the two words I heard in  this long, like, question.  Yeah, it was really.  It was great.  And so you guys were on the phone?  Yeah, yeah.  And was it live on TV?  The phone or live on MSNBC, you know, with Allison Stewart. 
[03:32:00]  To make it easy for Kevin, because he doesn't get to listen to the show a lot, just ring the  bell for every show reference.  Thank you, sir.  I appreciate that.  All right, here we go.  The Sacramento County Sheriff's Department has opened a criminal investigation into the  death of a California woman who drank too much water.  Jennifer Strange drank as much as two gallons of water during a radio show stunt to win  a popular gaming station system.  Excuse me.  The sheriff is considering filing charges after hearing part of the radio show broadcast. 
[03:32:30]  How much water do you think you can you can drink before you have to wee?  I do like two gallons.  Two gallons?  Oh, dude.  Can't you get water poisoning and, like, die?  No water.  Your body is 98% water.  Why can't you take in as much water as you want?  I don't know.  Maybe we should have researched this.  I don't know.  I mean, yeah.  Maybe we should have researched that more.  Shortly after that part of the conversation on January 12th, a nurse called in warning  of the dangers of drinking too much water.  The radio station has now fired 10 employees, including three of the morning show disc jockeys. 
[03:33:00]  Openie and Anthony are nationally syndicated radio hosts, also on XM Satellite Radio,  two of the best known in the business.  They're joining us now on the phone.  Guys, thank you so much for joining us today.  Thanks for having us, Allison.  Hey, Opie.  So, as two people who do provocative radio for a living, what did you think when you  first heard this story about this woman dying from drinking that much water during this  stunt?  Well, obviously, I feel bad for Jennifer and her family, but I also feel bad for the show  because they're just kind of a wacky morning show. 
[03:33:30]  They're not really shock jocks or edgy.  They were just kind of having a little fun and it blew up.  I'm trying to have some fun.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I feel bad.  Anthony, what did you think when you first heard this?  It was awful.  Well, you know, these poor kids of the mother are going to be asked for the rest of their  life, you know, how would your parents die, you know, or your parents die, and they're  going to have to come up with this ridiculous story of, you know, a radio stunt.  So, Opie, so what at this point in the story, if anything, points to the radio host's responsibility 
[03:34:00]  for this woman's death or absolves them from it?  That's a good question.  It's going to be tough to get out of this one.  You really don't sign up to kill a listener when you do a radio show.  So, I'd say they're pretty screwed.  Yeah, I was listening to you guys this morning and you played a clip from this show and one  of the guys was like, hey, she signed a release.  Does that, she signed a release excuse hold in your opinion? 
[03:34:30]  No, I think legally it might hold, but, so they don't get arrested.  But I think civil, a civil case will be brought up.  And it reminds me, it was a case years ago, back in 83, a couple of disc jockeys, I think  it was Ramon and Frankis in the morning, they had a staff member shove marshmallows in his  mouth and he choked wearing a bunny suit.  It was awful, tragic.  But the Nagel family's never recovered from that and, you know, I remember they were 
[03:35:00]  taken right off the air.  So, Opie, do you think this is going to bring any industry-wide changes or is this just going  to be one of these sad stories that sort of fades from the headlines?  Now, this is the question she's asking.  I'm not hearing this.  I'm dying.  I'm like, I can't believe he's just...  So, what's the Nagel reference?  Yeah, Eric Nagel is our assistant producer gentleman that is sitting out there and he was the one  that was in the bunny suit that day.  We shoved marshmallows in his mouth and made him say, chubby bunny. 
[03:35:30]  Like, he'd have to put one and say chubby bunny and then two, chubby bunny.  And it ends up just being a big mass in his mouth and he's going, and trying to put another  one in.  And, of course, I said he choked and the Nagel family never recovered.  Why did you ring the bell for how these poor kids are going to be asked how their parents  died?  Now, of course, you're a director, writer, you know, acting. 
[03:36:00]  I mean, you've seen it.  Oh, my God, yes.  Steve, our own Steve, who came in before, I believe you called him a workout...  Muscle queen.  Muscle queen, yes.  Muscle queen.  He and Bill, our own Bill in there, had put on this little production for a, I guess it  was a promo for the show.  Yeah.  I don't even know what it was at this point.  But all we did know from this is Steve's acting is so utterly bad.  It is so bad that he can't have a dynamic between asking someone how their parents died, 
[03:36:30]  which is pretty serious, to just throwing off a simple why not.  It's the same inflection.  Listen, please.  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  He gives a little more in the...  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  How'd your parents die?  That's...  And now he's, uh...  This is...  That's terrible, I'm sorry, which was my opening line, was that's terrible, I'm sorry. 
[03:37:00]  That's terrible, I'm sorry.  He does the little, that's terrible, I'm sorry.  That's terrible, I'm sorry.  I need it in context, man.  Yeah, you can hear what that performance is.  Well, please.  Because you, it sounds like, you could write it off as like, well, he's playing a character  that just has no vocal inflection.  No, this is just Steve.  Listen to these, like, listen to these sing-songy lines that I didn't even get in.  What are you doing in my house?  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  You're in my fucking house.  He does, I tell you, he sounds like GPS. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  He does, he sounds like that guy.  Hey, take a left.  Take a left.  This is the, I like the waving off kind of, and you can picture him just going, it just,  just...  No, nothing's wrong, just stay in the living room, I'll handle it.  Get the fuck out, now.  That's great for acting, Kevin.  That's angry.  You want to hear the promo so he can understand?  Oh, yeah, put it in context.  Here we go.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents a Wild Bill production.  Bill writes these, by the way.  Due to the massive critical acclaim and commercial success of the Van and Sam Show, XM202 is proud 
[03:38:00]  to present a new Opie and Anthony spin-off, a program that will surely take the radio world  by storm, announcing Steve C. and his best friend Bill, starring Opie and Anthony's own  Steve C. and his best friend forever, Bill the Intern, who is sensible, articulate, and  certainly not crazy.  Hello, anyone home?  Hello?  Hiya, Steve.  It's well, condo.  What are you doing in my house?  Why are you pissed off?  What's your fucking problem? 
[03:38:30]  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  The door was open.  I thought your wife was going to cook us a nice organic dinner.  Honey.  Is there a problem?  No.  Nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  Bill, get the fuck out.  Now.  I can't leave.  Why not?  My parents just died, and you're my legal guardian.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  How'd your parents die?  In their sleep?  Bill again? 
[03:39:00]  I still don't, to this day, get it.  Don't even ask, Kevin.  I want to cave Bill's head in for even...  They handed this in.  It was so awful.  We were never going to play it on the air, but it was so bad.  We had to play it, and now it's become this thing, and the Facebook listeners know these  lines, like they know their freaking whatever.  It ends with a wacky Gilligan's island.  On that side of their defense, it just sounds like they're being arched and trying to put  on what sounded like maybe a 50s, 60s sitcom.  Really?  With like...  How'd your parents die? 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  How'd your parents die?  It's not like Mike Brady was a great actor.  How'd your parents die?  You know, on the Brady Bunch.  That's true.  Well, no, he was.  That was a Mike.  He acted like a straight man.  Totally.  That was a pretty good actor.  Everyone thought.  Yeah.  He was bad.  All right, so I've got to hear your discussion of Ramona Funkas again.  So then I'm dying, and then she asked me a question.  I don't want to hear the question.  I hear a couple little words in there, and then I just lose it.  He shoved marshmallows in his mouth, and he choked wearing a bunny suit. 
[03:40:00]  It was awful tragic.  The Nagel family's never recovered from that, and I remember they were taken right off the  air.  So it's happened before.  It has.  Opie, do you think this is going to bring any industry-wide changes, or is this just  going to be one of these sad stories that sort of fades from the headlines eventually?  No, I think the boss is going to, you know, kind of pretty much wreck it for everybody  else.  I mean, the bosses in radio in general are beyond scared, as it is. 
[03:40:30]  And now that we officially have killed the listener out there, yeah, I think you're going  to hear a lot of really, really boring radio.  No one's going to really try to go to the edge or do anything edgy.  Well, Anthony...  Didn't management maybe say, hey, did you talk to a doctor about this or something, and  maybe get some confirmation if this is dangerous or not?  So, Anthony, you're throwing it up the food chain a little bit, that management maybe should  get involved and maybe should be held accountable.  Yeah, maybe you say, you know, did you talk to a doctor about this or something, you know. 
[03:41:00]  Maybe management should have looked into this and seen if it was a little more dangerous  than they thought.  Opie and Anthony, we really thank you for taking the time to be with us today.  Thank you, Allison.  Thank you.  Allison.  And then I threw in a little Howard Stern reference at the, uh, from his movie, Private  Parts, Allison.  Allison.  It was Allison.  My best friend.  So we had fun with that yesterday.  We shan't be called back, I think, for an interview again. 
[03:41:30]  And when did the Bill O'Reilly thing, and when did that happen?  He did a story and then brought you guys into it?  Yeah, that's, uh.  That's stupid, him, man, cow.  Yes.  Ah.  We did it at the end of the other show.  Yeah.  You were sleeping.  You were sleeping.  I was driving at that point.  Were you?  You were sleeping through that, or driving.  Driving.  Driving.  All right.  So what, just he referenced you guys?  I don't need to hear audio, but.  Well, whatever.  Yeah, like, shock jock again.  Whenever a radio show fucks up, we're the ones they throw B-roll on.  He goes, not anymore, sirs.  Not anymore.  Oh, I know. 
[03:42:00]  From now on, it's going to be like.  We might have lost that title.  Yeah, so you guys, you just gave it up, man.  And somebody took your title.  We got pushed down.  Who, what are the DJ's names?  Do they have names?  What's the morning show?  Morning Rave.  The Morning Rave.  A collective.  Where was it out of?  Lucas, Trish, and Maney.  Sacramento?  Sacramento?  With killer and inhuman.  Yeah.  Morning Grave.  We thought would be a good name for the show.  All right, we've been talking for an hour and a half.  Kevin Smith in the studio.  Bob Kelly.  Promoting something, Bob?  Yeah, we're going to be at the Atlanta Punchline the February 1st to the 3rd. 
[03:42:30]  Opie Anthony Dance Party Weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Na, na, na.  Na, na, na.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Comedy gone too far.  Opie and Anthony.  XM 202.  We're hanging with Kevin Smith today. 
[03:43:00]  Hello.  Bob Kelly today.  No.  I've drank a gallon and a half of water and I will not pee.  I'm putting this theory to the test.  You know, I usually just sit here and people sometimes comment.  They go, wow, Anthony hasn't gotten up to take a piss, like, the whole show.  I'm paranoid.  And I got all paranoid because I just sit here drinking club soda and stuff. 
[03:43:30]  So I figured I'd go in and take a piss just in case.  I ran out in the middle of the, when you guys were talking, I was like, felt it in the tip  of my helmet.  I'm not going to fucking.  I was sitting there playing poker 12 hours straight and never, like, never got up to  take a piss.  Not once.  There have been a couple of times in the casino I get up and I have to, you have to get up.  You can't concentrate on anything but how badly you have to piss.  And again, that's because they're bringing around drinks.  What do they do when you get up?  Do they, how do they?  The guy next to you steals the chips.  No, but do they, do they add your, uh, your blinds in? 
[03:44:00]  If you miss your blinds, you have to go between your blinds.  You wait.  You wait until the dealer button passes you by and then you.  Or if you're a fucking real man, you just never get up.  That's true.  You don't have to worry about that.  Real man.  If you're there to play poker, what the fuck are you pissing for?  You're a piss at home.  If you're a man, you fucking tuck your cock in like Son of a Lamb and you, you play.  Totally.  You just pinch it, man.  Pinch it hard.  You roll it up like a fruit roll up around your middle finger.  Or you take one of those bottles just under the table.  Shuffle it real close.  Does anybody ever do that? 
[03:44:30]  Anybody ever do that, you think?  I don't know.  Because you know you never miss.  World of infinite possibility, I imagine somebody has that.  You never miss and get it on your hands and then have to handle the cards that other  people will be handling the next deal.  There are rules to poker.  I mean, you watch it on ESPN and they just cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.  It's because it would be fucking boring watching 18 hours of these guys looking at each  other.  But there are, there are rules to fucking poker.  Pissing?  Just watching the time limit.  Are there rules to poker?  Yeah.  That's amazing.  I thought you could just walk over and look at other people's cards and...  That's how we play. 
[03:45:00]  Listen, Captain Obvious.  Let's see your cards.  I want to bet, but I don't know what you have.  I mean, other rules than the obvious fucking rules.  What do you have?  Because I really want to bet a lot, but I'm not sure if I beat you.  Let me see, I want to go all in, but let me see the river card.  Does it...  Did I make my straight?  There's a time limit.  Like, say, if we're playing you and you're just sitting there staring at me, I can call  for time or some shit, right?  Yeah, but that's like fucking World Poker Tour shit.  There's...  I haven't been in a home game or even like a lot of the games that you play in Vegas or  Atlantic City.  Well, you know, like the... 
[03:45:30]  Not the high stakes, high stakes game, but you know, playing 15 bucks, shit like that.  You don't sit there for like fucking 15 minutes like they do on World Poker Tour where millions  are at stake.  Someone will smack you in the head.  Sometimes when people take too long, people are like, come on, the fuck?  You either going to make...  Or you're chit-chatting with your friends, you don't give a shit.  Yeah, you don't get it.  Or, you know, has it ever gone on for more than like fucking four minutes?  No.  No.  Totally.  I mean, like, you know, maybe two minutes you just turn and you're like, come on, dude,  let's go.  What are you waiting for?  I should have got off the pot. 
[03:46:00]  Let me get that one.  Should we promote something?  15 bucks.  Fucking, listen to you.  What, man?  Just bragging on the air.  Hey, ladies and gentlemen.  15.  One, two is for pussies.  One, two is for pussies.  Five, five, ten.  Five, ten.  I like that game.  Five, ten's good.  You get some quality play.  When we played last night, we played one, two for a long time.  We went to two, four.  And then finally, like when we were left with people with stacks, we went five, ten.  And that game got so fucking quiet.  Yeah.  Before that, I was like, ah, ah, ah, ah.  And then suddenly it was just like, fold. 
[03:46:30]  Fucking playing the game.  Fold, fold, fold, fold.  And there's some people sitting around the table who, you know.  He raised, he's got a handful.  Totally.  They donked out and shit, so they were just sitting around talking comics and whatnot.  And I felt a little bad because finally I was just like,  guys, this is a high-stakes game, so take the comic book over there.  I don't want to fucking talk about, like, can whole feed up thing.  I want to, I got fucking 60 bucks out there, man.  I want to see what's going to happen.  This is cash on the line, my friend.  I hear you.  Should we promote something, Kevin?  You've been here for two hours.  You got Catch and Release coming out?  Catch and Release comes out a week from today. 
[03:47:00]  Go see it.  You got a girlfriend?  Take her to see it.  If you don't have a girlfriend, I don't know if you want to see it.  It is kind of a chick flick.  Chick flicky?  Jennifer Garner.  It's a Jennifer Garner picture.  But it's actually, it's funny, and I'm pretty funny in it.  I agree.  And I'm pretty funny.  I'm pretty funny in it.  I bring the funny.  I'm the funny fat guy you can identify with.  Boy, let me see.  Big Cav.  Hmm.  Is he going to give this a bad review or not?  Oh, you saw it?  You can't offend me.  It's not my picture.  You went to Volga Thun.  Volga Thun, yeah.  You can't offend me.  So I saw it a year ago.  Wow.  You can only offend me if you said my performance was bad.  Was my performance bad?  No.  No.  His performance wasn't bad. 
[03:47:30]  There you go.  You saw this movie a year ago.  Yes, sir.  Wow.  It was actually May.  So it was six months ago.  May.  Seven months ago.  She was pregnant back, was it before?  She'd already dropped a kid.  She dropped a kid.  Previous December.  Ah.  Yeah.  She looks pretty good in the movie.  Yeah.  Well, we were shooting while she was, right before she got really pregnant.  She was pregnant in the beginning of the show.  And then by the time we wrapped, she was just kind of starting to show a little bit  of a belly.  What have you been seeing lately?  I'm sorry.  I'm captivated by Oberman. 
[03:48:00]  You guys watch Oberman at all?  I watch him.  A couple of times.  Yeah.  Maybe it's me.  I fucking love that dude's rants at the end of the show.  Like, that dude will go off on the president.  He's got a sense of humor.  Mr. President, shame on you.  But it's a real weird, dry sense of humor.  Yeah, yeah.  He's definitely not the runner.  That's the weird thing.  It's like he's been doing all this political stuff lately.  But, you know.  He was on ESPN for years.  I guess it's the right easily dismiss him as like, dude, you're a former sportscaster.  Right, right, right. 
[03:48:30]  I like him a lot.  I like him over Bill O'Reilly.  Oh, God, yes.  O'Reilly.  I watch him just to be annoyed, O'Reilly.  Stephen Colbert.  Stephen Colbert's great.  Colbert's great.  When it comes to that sarcastic wit.  Yeah, but that dude's just playing a character.  Yeah.  But like, really up front about playing a character.  He's so opposite of the character he plays.  Yeah.  That the further right he goes, the funnier it gets.  Right.  Because you just know that he's not that guy.  He's got that Carol O'Connor, Archie Bunker thing going for him.  Where people are just like, if you tune in, don't know anything about the show, you're 
[03:49:00]  like, my God.  What an asshole this guy is.  My God.  So, we were talking about movies.  Any good movies lately?  What have I seen lately?  I mean, I've seen everything.  Hit me with a flick.  All right.  How about that?  I won't bias you with my opinion of it.  Was it Children of Men?  Children of Men.  You know, I mean, interesting, quasi-sci-fi flick, and well-made.  Obviously, dude's a really good director, but whatever.  There was nothing there.  Yeah.  At the end of the day.  I thought, okay.  I don't like movies that end with like, you know, a dude.  Well, I don't want to spoil it. 
[03:49:30]  I don't like movies that end with that.  What's the movie about, though?  Because I have no clue.  Some kind of cataclysmic event.  It looked like nuclear war to me.  They hint at, you know, like the escalation of where we're living right now.  Right now.  In terms of like terrorism and kind of limiting of freedoms and whatnot.  And all that's, something bad has happened, and all that remains is England.  England is the only like civilized country left.  Quotation marks civilized.  Civilized.  They're not quite, you know.  And for some reason, chicks have lost the ability to have children. 
[03:50:00]  Okay.  So it's predicated on a world where, like in the beginning of the movie, like the world  falls into a hush as the youngest.  So you can just dump in chicks and nothing happens?  That's it.  But they're not worried about that.  The weird thing is, and that's, I thought was kind of interesting, because you're like,  you tend not, I have a kid, I don't even think about kids.  You know, like I love my daughter, but I'm like, whatever, I got shit to do.  But like, you think that if there was, if there was no chance or no new children and we 
[03:50:30]  were not being renewed, like, would it affect your mood?  Right.  Like, because everybody in the movie, there's this melancholy that hangs over.  The youngest inhabitant of planet Earth has just died, and he was like 18 years old.  Yeah, it was a big thing.  It's like an 18-year-old guy, the youngest person on Earth died.  So it was on the news, everybody stopped, looked at the TVs, and they were freaking  out about it.  Because I guess it would, you know, eliminate hope.  Exactly.  Whatever you're doing at that point in your life then just becomes riding your life out, 
[03:51:00]  knowing that there's not going to be any future.  I think that was kind of a cool part of it.  There was pimp shit like the one dude who had, like, Michelangelo's David in his house.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, because I guess the other countries, like, where would that be?  The Louvre?  Of France, yeah.  You know, something like that?  Yeah.  He was just able to go and poach, like, these fantastical works of art that means something  to now, but there and none.  Everything does, yeah, that would become something that would really mean anything.  Everything loses its value when there's no more, there's no more people once the last 
[03:51:30]  person dies off.  And that I found interesting.  Right.  And thought, that's a great premise.  When I watched the trailer, I was like, wow, that's good.  But then where it went and where it ended, I was like, what the fuck?  There was like this thing called the human something, what was it?  The human project.  The human project.  What the fuck was it?  Where was it?  It was barely, like, it seemed to be this important thing that they just dropped. 
[03:52:00]  It's a phantom, like, what some people consider a phantom or kind of a mythological program.  It's all rumor and hype, but, you know, it doesn't exist in the confines of the UK.  Was that it?  Yeah, it's just like somewhere out there the human project exists, but they never really  explained what it was.  To kind of give hope to people, maybe, that...  Something.  Like, somewhere...  I mean, that's...  You're right.  They never really tied it in that much.  They just had to get this girl who, I don't think we're spoiling anything, but they find  a pregnant girl.  And why did they have to move her around so much? 
[03:52:30]  I don't know.  You would imagine everybody would be like, right on, let's make her queen.  She could have a baby or something like that.  Yeah.  Like, we got to get her out of here.  Why keep it secret?  Why the big...  And there are people who are terrorists who are using her, you know, as a political pawn.  Yeah.  And...  For some reason.  Clive Owen, just, you know, based on the...  That was the shocking thing.  The Julianne Moore thing.  Yeah.  Wow.  Where you're like, okay, this movie stars Clive Owen and Julianne Moore, and then you're  like, maybe I was wrong.  Okay, that's pretty cool.  That comes out of left field.  This sounds really interesting.  Yeah, it is.  It is.  Definitely.  You know what, it's a...  Up until the end, it's different.  I don't know if you want to, like, get out of your house to go see it, but, like, 
[03:53:00]  by the time it hits DVD, definitely check it out.  Right, right.  Yeah.  But it's, if you're like, I want to get out, see a movie, escape for a while, there's  escapism there, but you don't, it doesn't really take off in the way of, like, a Friday  night flick.  Yeah.  What about...  Thinking Man's.  Thinking Man's sci-fi is what it is.  What about that movie, it's not out yet, but it's coming out soon to you, The 300.  Oh, based on the comic book?  Yeah.  That looks dope, doesn't it?  It looks amazing.  I've never seen it.  Is that the trailer we've seen?  The first day I saw the trailer, I went, holy shit, and Patrice was in here, and I go, 
[03:53:30]  you've got to fucking see this trailer, and I showed him, he was like, he was pissed.  The guy that directed it?  No, the lead guy, the Spartan, that guy.  Gerard Gerard.  Unbelievable, man.  The guy that did the Dawn of the Dead remake.  Every exact scenario, he made this.  Yeah.  Timeline.  Shot it all on a fucking green screen stage.  So it had that insane look to it.  Do you know what he was in?  Yeah.  When does it come out?  Going to IMDb.  What's his name?  Gerard something?  Not smart.  Was he Dracula?  Was that Dracula 3000? 
[03:54:00]  2000?  Was he the guy that played Phantom of the Opera?  Phantom of the Opera as well?  That's him, man.  A movie?  He is a fucking badass.  Gerald Butler.  Is that it?  Gerard Butler?  He's a badass.  It does look awesome, though.  Patrice said, he goes, I want to see this right now.  I'm pissed that I can't see it now.  And he goes, when I see it, if this fucking movie sucks, he goes, I'm never seeing another  movie again.  Because the trailer looks so fucking good.  I don't think it'll suck, man, at the end of the day.  It's like, that movie, I think, ultimately delivers on his promise. 
[03:54:30]  And the dude who did it, remember everyone was worried going into Dawn of the Dead?  Like, how do you remake Dawn of the Dead?  The dude made a kick-ass fucking remake.  It was really good.  And now that's the dude that's going to do The Watchmen, that kind of book.  Did you see Independent Film Network was playing it, Film Channel was playing it, Unknown  called five guys or so in a warehouse, wake up, and one of them's tied up.  They're all fucking kind of beat up.  And they kind of figure out through time, through the time that goes by, that some of them are 
[03:55:00]  hostages, and maybe a couple of them are the people that were supposed to hold them  until the bosses get back.  But they don't know, because there's some kind of gas in canisters that fell and kind  of wiped out their memory for a short period of time.  And then slowly the memory starts coming back.  There's a great fucking little story about who's the bad guy, who's the good guys.  It's a real five-hander, it takes place just in a room.  Yeah, yeah.  I like that.  That sounds good.  It's called Unknown?  Yeah, Unknown.  Did you see the movie High Tension? 
[03:55:30]  Yeah.  Is that a fucking badass movie?  It was badass up until the illogical ending.  Then I was just like, I mean, it was a great-looking movie.  And it really delivers until the last five minutes, where you're like, you're shitting  me.  Like, who drove the fucking truck?  Like, shit like that.  Just don't make sure.  Oh, you don't want shit like that.  This is the beginning of the movie, though, when the guy is just such a...  And he's getting ahead, and you're like, wow, this guy's getting ahead in a truck.  And then he takes the head and throws it out the window.  You're like, what the fuck?  And then when he comes in, the first scene is just amazing. 
[03:56:00]  He just comes in and just, funk, and just kills everybody.  That was frightening.  The scene where he breaks into the house.  It's just...  Like, if you're ever...  I'm one of those people who lives in terror of home invasion.  Oh, me too.  This is the ultimate fucking nightmare.  Thank God, somebody else.  These people don't fucking understand.  Oh, my God.  Are you an alarm guy?  Like, make sure it's on all the time.  Doors locked all the time.  If they're coming in for me, they want me and mine.  They're going to have to go through some shit. 
[03:56:30]  Oh, there's going to be a battle.  Believe me, there's going to be a fucking battle.  Got a moat, crocodiles, I'm ready.  Oh, he's got it all.  I got bats in every room.  I got aluminum bats ready to go and shit.  Bats.  Father-in-law, father-in-law arms.  I got something a little more arranged than bats.  Yes.  And believe me, I've already...  I like to have things marked out on my floor.  It's frigging...  I have my fucking house blocked out where I know where everyone's supposed to stand  during a gun battle.  Anthony, Anthony.  You're like, we're running a drill.  Let's go. 
[03:57:00]  Here we go, drill.  He's actually Rainbow Six.  Oh, yeah.  That's what it is.  Get behind me.  Sneaking around corners.  No, but that home invasion shit.  Yeah.  Because you know...  Then don't see this movie, man.  If you see my attention, you'll just feel like that's...  I knew it.  That's what they do.  Because it just bombs up to the door.  Honestly, it just comes...  It's so...  It brings the doorbell.  What do you want?  And that's it.  And it's just...  You're like...  Kick it in or...  Nope.  Nope.  The person opens the door?  There's one of those like...  Not a peephole, but the little door within the door.  So you can open it and see what's up. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah.  The dude just kind of gets stabbed that way.  Reaches in.  Opens the door.  Oh, fuck.  The really fucked up part, though, is...  And I don't think we're really spoiling anything.  Because there is a big fucking twist at the end of the movie.  Okay.  Because right now, you're like...  You know, it opens with this dude, like if I was saying, getting the head from a head.  And you're like, oh, one of these fucking misogynistic pieces of shit.  It's not.  But then it's even more misogynistic based on the twist.  You know what I'm saying?  Because it's just like...  It's instead of a movie that just victimizes women, women are victimized by the movie itself. 
[03:58:00]  Based on the plot twist.  What's this called now?  It's called...  High Tension.  High Tension.  Okay.  The father...  The guy gets him and then opens...  It just...  I mean, nonchalantly opens the door, comes in.  The father's crawling up the stairs.  He takes his foot and just pushes the father's head through the banister.  That he doesn't fit through, but now he's stuck.  His head's stuck through the banister.  Then he just...  Nonchalantly goes over...  Don't ruin too much.  This won't.  It won't.  But he gets a bureau and just pushes it and just flies it. 
[03:58:30]  He goes right across the room and just chops the guy's head off.  Fucking decapitates the dude.  Wow.  Decapitates the dude.  And it's like...  You're like this.  But it happens.  It goes from here to here.  In like three seconds, you're like...  What the fuck?  And the dude just looks like...  He runs...  He has this little fucking greasy work truck.  It looks like...  He looks like a locksmith.  Yeah.  Just like the average dude.  A little on the grody side.  Wow.  Under fingernails.  But so calm about it and shit.  It's the nightmare.  And he's got no aim.  It's not like I want money and shit. 
[03:59:00]  He's just psychotic.  But again, I stress...  Yeah.  There is a twist.  Okay.  Yeah.  Big twist.  Now, big budget movie or big publicity movie.  No, it's a French film, but it's French.  It's French.  I mean, the next one I'll bring up.  Oh, okay.  Rocky Balboa.  I enjoyed it.  I thought it was good.  Anything is up from Rocky V.  Right.  Yeah.  It actually is Rocky V.  That's what it is.  They should really go down.  They eliminated it, and now that's Rocky V.  Right.  In my eyes.  It kind of...  I think it did away with a lot of the last few. 
[03:59:30]  Like, Rocky, the original, was a great movie.  The second one was good.  I loved the fucking Clubber Lang shit.  That was good.  And then it just fell apart.  I mean, this one kind of really brought it right back to the first one.  I thought it looked good, too.  Totally.  Like, he did a good job with the fight scenes.  Looked like there was a camera in the ring.  No, there was.  And how fucked up was it that the...  Like, the...  Hard-pressed call her love interest because she's not...  They don't really get a relationship. 
[04:00:00]  Yeah, yeah.  But the female in the movie, the chick in the movie, the lead.  The Adrian character.  The Adrian, yeah, because apparently he didn't want Adrian in there.  You need the Adrian character, right?  He needs the ice hered for the sympathy.  But it's the chick from the first movie.  The little chick that you're walking home with.  She's like, hey, Rocky, screw you, creeper.  And, like, he brings this...  Not the same actress, obviously.  He brings this character back.  Yep.  Fucking 20, 25 years later, whatever it is, and, like, reintroduces her.  As a major part of the movie.  Totally.  His inspiration.  And she had sex with a black dude.  Well, yeah. 
[04:00:30]  Not in the show.  Which was a weird...  That was just a weird moment when it showed Rocky that he was a true Philly fucking Italian  guy.  That's good to say, man.  Totally.  He was like, hey, the white guy.  Oh, shit.  All right, fuck it.  I'm Rocky.  All right.  So you banged the black guy.  Let's go.  It's just odd to watch the Rocky character in this one.  And then you go back a couple of the, like, four and five.  And he was, like, in the suit.  The smart Rocky.  Yes.  Like, the educated, profound Rocky. 
[04:01:00]  Right.  He wasn't this guy, anyway.  He was, like, you know, regular spoken.  And then he's back to being, like, hey, Mick, what are you going to get down to the restaurant?  The dad was five.  He was back to being the first Rocky.  Like, it was like flowers for Algernon.  Well, because he fucking...  He took the shit.  It worked for a while.  And then he's back in the fucking hospital.  Five isn't...  The plot line of five was he's all punchy and shit like that.  Yeah, yeah.  He's too punchy.  That's how I get away with him being, like, kind of ridiculous.  Yeah.  He was less punchy in this movie, though, which I thought was great. 
[04:01:30]  Because in five, he was so stupid.  Yeah.  Hey, yeah, Tommy, I'm your gigi.  Yeah.  But this one, he was telling stories at the restaurant.  It was more...  Yeah, that was kind of cool.  It made more sense.  I did like that.  And it was a fucking very sad little point.  You'd kind of, like, throw him in the ring.  You see, the people were just, like, looking at him, like, okay, man, just give me my lasagna.  I get some fucking fries, please.  Shut up with your stories, Rocky.  Right.  The only parts I really didn't like about it was it got a little sappy with the fucking ghost Adrian. 
[04:02:00]  The little ghostly figure there by the stairs when he was kind of imagining.  When they were rolling, kind of like that flashback.  Yeah, that was a little, like, a little too sappy for me.  And then how quickly the son kind of changed his tune.  That was the only thing.  I thought the son storyline...  Yeah.  Well, it seems like he split two son storylines.  Yeah.  Because that chick, Little Marie,'s got a kid that he starts kind of palling around with.  And then he's got his own kid who, for reasons unknown, doesn't like his father.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden comes around and... 
[04:02:30]  He kind of came around from one speech that Rocky could have given him, like, fucking two years ago.  And he's like, oh, why didn't you say that fucking 15 years ago?  We could have had a better relationship.  It's been great.  Yeah, but, I mean, I still...  I mean, I...  It was good.  The kid, I like the kid, too.  Yeah, the kid's performance was good.  It was great, but he had that lip, too.  He had the Rocky lip.  He's got the...  I don't know.  There's something going on with...  I swear to God, watch TV now.  Everybody has a fucked up bottom lip.  That comes...  There's a lot of people.  It's the Carl Speckler lip that everybody's kind of got now. 
[04:03:00]  I'm on the foot green.  He's a Cinderella boy.  Cinderella moment.  Oh, good.  I'm glad you thought that was okay, because I was bashing the prospect of it.  Right.  And then when I saw it, I was like, you know, I went into it thinking, all right, I'm going  to fucking hate this.  And I was like, wow, this is pretty good.  Totally watchable flick.  The montage scene, you get the montage.  It felt a little abbreviated this time around.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It wasn't as much time.  I still got...  My dick got hard with the music.  When the...  You get the final bell, and then they're in the ring. 
[04:03:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I want to go drink eggs.  I want to go drink eggs.  It looked like he had a hard time getting that last egg down, too.  I don't know how many takes that was, but they show him drinking the eggs, not as long  a scene as the original one.  It's just him gulping down like the last couple in the glass, and he kind of gags on one  a little bit.  The original...  Oh!  Finally, Bill.  Jesus Christ.  Wait till we talk about the next movie.  He's got great timing, doesn't he?  The original Rocky scene when he did that, when he drank... 
[04:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  It was so quiet.  It was...  You know, you could feel how cold it was outside.  Yeah, yeah.  The way...  Oh, it was unbelievable.  Now, they're actually doing Rambo...  Rambo 4.  Yeah, he's doing that Rambo flick.  That could be a problem.  That was part of the deal, right?  Yeah, he's doing both.  But at the end of the day, like, I mean, he made Rocky work.  Maybe he can make Rambo work.  Yeah.  I thought Rambo 1, man, was...  I mean, at the end scene, that monologue...  Oh, the first one?  Let me tell you something.  If you act in your life, you try to act that scene.  Try to deliver that and make it work. 
[04:04:30]  When you think Rambo, though, you don't think of the first one.  You think of the second one where he's...  Yeah, First Blood.  Where's the monologue?  From Rambo or from First Blood?  First Blood.  Rambo, at the end.  Well, there's First Blood, which wasn't called Rambo at all.  First Blood.  Then there was Rambo 2.  First Blood.  Rambo, First Blood 2.  First Blood.  Yep.  First Blood.  And there's a monologue at the end?  At the end of the movie.  I think a lot of theater students are auditioning for things going like,  I'm going to do the monologue from the end of Rambo.  Listen to the monologue.  I swear to God, it's a great monologue.  I'm sure it is.  It really is.  And he can deliver it.  I wouldn't be able to do a fucking monologue like that. 
[04:05:00]  It's over, Johnny.  It's over.  Nothing is over.  Nothing.  You just don't turn it off.  That's part of it.  They don't give it Steve's fucking...  It's not like Steve's.  Nothing is over.  Nothing.  You don't turn it off.  It's a great monologue.  There's a movie called Perfume.  Art house movie.  Pretty expensive art house movie, but it's based on this book that I never read, this  bestseller about this weird serial killer case, but it's not really a serial killer movie. 
[04:05:30]  Most fucked up film I saw a year.  Really?  I had no idea where it was going.  Ends with an orgy.  Oh, wow.  Totally fucked up.  I like the one thing.  It just twists and turns the whole time.  I think that's worth watching.  I mean, it's not like...  I wouldn't say that is a Friday night.  Like, let's go out.  Let's hit this movie.  Perfume.  It's like a Sunday afternoon.  Probably.  But like, you know, it's unlike most movies you see where you can kind of call it from  20 minutes out and everything is going to happen and it's just whether or not it's  executed well enough to keep you entertained. 
[04:06:00]  This movie fucking takes so many bizarre turns.  You're like, what the fuck is going on?  I love those movies.  Those are the best.  They just blindside you like that.  And I hate when you do figure those out where it's a real clever twist and you're like,  fuck, I see it now.  Right.  Shit.  And then I'll usually turn to my girlfriend and go, I know something.  And then I'll grab a pencil and paper and write it down and put it aside.  And then the second it happens, I hold it up in front of her face.  That's a great way to do that. 
[04:06:30]  There.  I knew it.  Because how many people go, see, I knew it?  You don't want to ruin it.  You didn't tell me.  She sits around with her friends and goes, he does this annoying fucking thing.  When we're watching movies.  Why does he do this?  Write it down.  I get it.  He's smart.  Look at all these little papers.  Great.  You figured it out.  She figured out fucking sixth sense.  Wow, I didn't.  Yeah.  Before that, I haven't figured it out.  Somebody told me that fucking, there was a friend of mine that worked on that movie.  A friend?  A year and a half ago, told me, before the movie came out, a year and a half prior, told  me what it was, told me the ending and shit. 
[04:07:00]  And I totally blocked it or forgot because I'm in the theater and I was like, he's fucking  dead?  That's fucked up.  Yeah.  And then I was like, wait a second, I knew this.  I knew that.  Fuck.  Someone told me this a year and a half ago.  No, it was a great movie, Stomp the Yard.  Did you see Stomp the Yard?  What?  Fucking throw.  Jesus Christ.  Hot ass in your face.  What are they doing?  Just Stomp the Yard.  Stomp the Yard.  Oh, I'm supposed to know that?  I did a college, okay?  And yet it was $25 million.  And those guys came out before me.  What are you going to do?  Just to stop the yard, dude?  They're like, yeah, we're just going to do this thing before you.  All of a sudden, like 50, just come out, 50 of them. 
[04:07:30]  The place is going retarded.  It's mostly black college.  And then nothing you do will be nearly as entertaining.  That's a tough act.  I'm going to go up there and go, uh-huh.  Marshmally-oes.  There was a, of course, I lived in San Juan Capistrano, California, growing up, where the  Swallows come back every year.  And there was a big parade.  Like, it was Swallows week.  It was a week of drunk fucking cowboys.  And especially back, it was like the mid-70s.  It was still very equestrian, very small town kind of thing. 
[04:08:00]  And the parade was like covered wagons, and you'd fucking ride your horses.  Very cowboy.  Well, they brought in the fucking, from Compton, the Soul Street Stompers, they were called.  And that's what they did.  They fucking stomped.  You never saw a bunch of fucking rednecks watching this with that butthead look on their face,  where Butthead's mouth would just be open, like, uh.  They had no clue how to react to this.  I think some of them just wanted to unload, like it was an ambush.  But they would have shot family that was across the street. 
[04:08:30]  The only reason this didn't happen.  Keep stamping your feet, just stay away from our women.  Yeah, stay away from our women.  But I didn't realize it was that old.  That craft, if you want to call it that, stomping the streets, stomping the yard.  It's fucking unbelievable.  It scares the shit out of you.  And it just goes, whoa!  And they just go nuts.  The place just gets, I mean, it really brings an energy up in the room that's just, you  can't match and follow.  We got mixed feelings about it, man.  It's entertaining and shit, but at the same time, I'm like, I don't like watching people 
[04:09:00]  do shit I can't do.  Yeah.  Why would I want to do that?  I watch sports for that reason.  I don't want to see that.  Watch people, especially like, you watch gymnastics and you're like, who knew a human body can do  that?  And I can't even, I can't fucking get that high without a, I don't want to get up to  take a piss.  You're like, I've never even tried.  Like, they're getting up that high just by running and jumping.  Yeah.  And I can't fucking reach a goddamn thing up on a shelf.  And I'm like, can you grab me a glass of water while you're in there?  Like, I won't get up and shit.  Hey, Kevin, what'd you think of King of Scotland?  Last King of Scotland, I thought, he was fantastic. 
[04:09:30]  I love him.  And the movie is good, but he is fantastic.  Like, he elevates that.  He's going to win the Oscar, don't you think?  I mean, I think he might for best actor.  He seems like the man to beat.  I mean, he just won the Golden Globe.  I don't know about the film itself, though.  I don't even think the film would get down there.  His performance was amazing, though.  It was fantastic.  But like, you sit there going, like, you felt bad for the dude who played the doctor,  because the movie's supposed to be about him, and you're fucking so fascinated by Edie  Amin and Forrest Whitaker's performance that he is the whole picture.  He was fucked.  Earth, wind, and fire for Edie Amin and little brother. 
[04:10:00]  Fucking love that.  I can't get that out of my head, that he's just from Fast Times at Ridgemont.  Right.  You're keeping it up nicely.  What movie wins the Oscar this year?  In my opinion, what do I think?  We'll write it down on a piece of paper.  We'll see if you're right.  I know.  I'll do the fucking Anthony where I write it down a couple months from now.  Write it down and shove it in front of me.  Pull it up in front of my wife and I'm going to check it out.  I know it.  She's like, what are you doing?  Son of a bitch, he was right.  I don't know.  I mean, for me personally, I love The Departed. 
[04:10:30]  I think that should win.  Yeah, it was good.  The Golden Globes, they kind of gave the...  Which is a weird bellwether because they have two separate categories.  Comedy, musical, and drama.  Comedy, musical, they gave to Dreamgirls.  And then drama, they gave to Babel.  And I just don't see either of those movies really being the contender for the Academy Award.  The Departed was one of those movies that at the end, you're kind of like,  all right, what just happened?  It's just the end of the series of deaths.  Yeah, you're like, wait a minute, what the fuck? 
[04:11:00]  I just summed it all up.  I kind of didn't like the end.  It was just like, all right, let's just wrap this up now.  Oh, I loved it.  I thought it was cool.  I've watched that movie fucking nine times now.  Wow.  Because I got the Academy screener and shit.  So I saw it in the theaters, and I saw it when I went and did Ebert and Rope, where I sat in for Ebert.  And that's the first time I saw it.  Once I got my screener, that's my go-to movie now.  Yeah.  Did you hear that Jack Nichols, and I guess it may be a rumor or something,  but somebody was saying Jack was every day just bitching on the set to Martin Scossetti. 
[04:11:30]  You wouldn't hire me.  You wouldn't hire me.  You never gave me a job.  Really?  And he was just a dick on set to him because he never would give him a job back in the day.  But I guess the people backing wanted Nicholson in this movie.  Somehow I can't see that being true.  Why wouldn't you hire Nicholson?  I mean, you're Jack Nicholson.  Why are you bitter anymore?  Yeah, why would you be bitter, first of all?  Fuck it.  I was the joker.  I made $500 million.  But it's true.  Bob Kelly's an expert.  That's true.  I'm a doctor, and I'm also an expert.  Doctor to Bob.  Hey, let's go to Amanda in Michigan. 
[04:12:00]  Amanda.  Hi, Opie and Anthony.  I love you guys.  Thank you, Amanda.  Kevin, I love Fox 2.  Never seen it before.  I loved it.  The commentary, I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed the intro to the movie.  I thought that was really nice.  That you did it.  It made me more excited to watch the movie, and more excited for you.  I enjoyed the little bit about Toll Pants. 
[04:12:30]  But all in all, it was a good movie.  And everyone, thanks for making me laugh.  All right, Amanda.  Thank you.  Thank you, Amanda.  You'll never get better extras than you do with Kevin's movies.  No, like all of them.  I love the fucking...  The commentary is good.  It's not this too-cool-for-the-room fucking commentary.  It's funny shit.  Like you usually turn on commentary, and you're like, all right, I want to learn about the  movie a little bit and stuff.  But you guys are really funny.  Yeah, you'll learn nothing.  And you get these extra...  You'll learn nothing.  You guys will go off on tangents and be like, I thought they were going to discuss this part 
[04:13:00]  of the movie.  And they're all talking about some night they were hanging out or something.  Well, now the trick to those things, like, I don't even put the fucking headphones on.  Whenever we sit down in the commentary, I'm like, nobody put headphones on.  Because otherwise, you lapse into the movie and it gets quiet.  It gets quiet for a little bit.  Now you're just talking.  So you get the headphones off, you're just having a two-hour conversation.  And then also, like, outtakes and clips and shit like that.  You guys, again, not afraid to look fucking silly.  No.  I overcompensate, sir.  It's great.  So I pack my DVDs full of tons of extra stuff. 
[04:13:30]  They're packed.  I got to jump in.  We have a scheduled voiceover session.  What?  They're calling us from L.A. and Boston's involved.  Holy shit.  So do you do it on air or is the show over at this point?  We should.  No, we got to go.  I mean, if you want to stay and do it on the air.  So we can then critique it later on.  After what you did to Dee Dee, that kind of ass raping?  I'm not interested.  He was being whipped on his ass by some fucking guy.  Did you see Ghost Rider yet, Kevin?  Not yet, no. 
[04:14:00]  But I'm going to sit in for Eber again, and so I'm going to go see it in the first week  of February.  They redid the trailer for that.  It looks better now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The original trailer I wanted to throw up.  Fuck.  They canceled it.  I mean, good news.  They canceled the voiceover.  That was a real, like, breaking news.  We got to go.  Wait.  Here's a second post-it.  I think we might be late, actually.  We're not going.  Pretty good.  What was the line at the end of the Jay and Silent Bob?  The line at the end when she was like, are you going to fuck me?  And she goes, well, see, she goes, it's something like that. 
[04:14:30]  And then he goes, no, seriously, you're going to fuck me?  That had to be, I laughed fucking out loud in the theater.  That was awesome.  Are we going to fuck or not?  That was one of the funniest lines.  Are we going to fuck or not?  Yeah.  No, he goes, we're going to fuck or not?  And then she laughed, like, giggling.  And you're like, oh, it's going to end cute.  And he goes, no, seriously.  Are we going to fuck or not?  Are we going to fuck or not?  I was like, what?  He's funny, dude.  He's fucking beautiful.  He heard it the first time you said it.  Nice thought.  Wow, you're a fucking.  Oh, Anthony's a fucking cunt.  Well, we're tired.  We're tired.  What have you guys?  We've been out here five and a half hours.  You guys think he gets jealous? 
[04:15:00]  Is this Isaiah Washington story?  Yeah.  Who do you believe in this one?  He's just melting down.  Well, who's this dude on TV?  He's a gay expert.  Wow.  Apparently.  I mean, all the Grey's Anatomy beard.  He just penciled that beard in right before they went.  What the hell would he be called?  Apologizes.  Well, you know what he did?  He got up and said something like.  That's a lady boy right there.  I never.  I never.  He was talking about somebody.  I don't know who he was talking about.  But he said, I never called.  And then said his name.  It's the dude in the show.  That dude, I guess, who, because of the whole incident, wound up saying, yeah, hey, guess 
[04:15:30]  what?  I'm gay.  But it was a story from a while ago.  And then it went quiet.  He said, I never called him a faggot.  But the problem is, ABC thought the whole thing was done.  Right.  Yeah.  Like, this guy said he said it.  He had to come out of the closet.  They talked to everyone behind the scenes.  It was supposedly over.  Now, at the Golden Globes, he jumps on mic and goes, I never said he was a faggot.  And ABC's like, what the fuck?  Faggot.  I thought we figured.  I thought we took care of all this.  And that's the thing.  Like, when you read the story in print, they give his quote, but it's F, asterisk, asterisk, 
[04:16:00]  asterisk.  And then T.  They don't even print it.  And it's like, you're just reporting what some dude said.  Right.  Yeah, why can't you write it?  Yeah, why can't you just write what he said?  But anyway, yeah.  So he went up there, apropos of nothing, or maybe somebody asked a question that kind  of led him to it.  Not really.  It came out of nowhere.  Really?  On the Golden Globes?  So him just, but not on the show, but it was backstage, right?  Doing press or something?  Yeah, doing the press backstage.  Because I don't think you jumped in there to present, and you're like, first off, I  never called anybody a faggot.  With that echo.  Best Supporting Actor nominees are. 
[04:16:30]  But just, yeah, he dredged it all up again.  Why bring it up?  He's a little crazy.  That guy's a little out of his mind.  I guess so.  You can tell he's a little, you know, he's got those wide thousand yard stare.  He's a little out of his mind.  And why would you do that, man?  Like, you're on a fucking hit show.  I know.  Like, don't be the David Caruso where you're like, I'm going to go leave.  Oh, did you say David Caruso?  Where's our David Caruso line of the day?  He's got the corner on this dirtbag market.  He's also got quite a little business on his hands.  Yes, he does, Frank.  He also has murdered one. 
[04:17:00]  Did you see that YouTube clip?  Oh, yeah, that's what got us hooked on.  That is fucking genius.  That's what got us hooked on.  I watched it the other day, man.  It's like eight minutes long, and you're like, oh, my God, he does it every episode.  You watch every second of it.  The line, the delivery, the glasses, and then the exit, stage left even.  He's just out of frame.  He's gone.  I'm done, Frank.  That YouTube short is made by the...  Yeah!  After each one.  Oh, after each one.  Yeah. 
[04:17:30]  Oh, it's classic.  And now I see it on.  It's on A&E.  And every time it's on, I have to catch the beginning because I just want to see him deliver  that line.  He does half of line and then finishes the thought.  The line.  And then leaves.  What we have here, Frank, is murder one.  Yeah!  And then off, out of frame.  I can't remember, and we've talked about this a thousand times, but I can't remember  him being that bad.  But I think the YouTube collection, the compilation, is what nails it home. 
[04:18:00]  But I've been watching...  I think you watch the show, and I think if you were just watching CSI, you might not have  really picked up on it.  But once they put it all together in a neat little package for you, suddenly it calls it  to your attention, so then the next time you watch the show, you're like, oh, I guess  he doesn't do it.  Never watched it until I saw the montage there.  Well, it also plays differently because the adultery thing is the beginning of the big  intro with the boats and the sunset and everything else.  But now it's like just a... 
[04:18:30]  You know, it's the stinger after his one-liners now.  It stings.  It stings.  It stings.  The glasses on are off.  He was so good in Mad Dog and Glory.  Remember him in Mad Dog and Glory?  It was a great movie.  That was such a great fucking movie, and he was really good in it, too.  He was good in, what's that movie with Sean Penn, too, that Irish movie they did in Hell's  Kitchen?  State of Grace?  Yeah.  Wasn't he in that, too?  No.  You sure?  Oh, that was Ed Harris.  Ed Harris.  Jeez, you mixed up Ed Harris?  And what's his name?  Gary Oldman.  A redhead.  Gary Oldman.  He was in...  What did I rewatch fairly recently? 
[04:19:00]  New Jack City, and he was in that.  David Caruso was in that, too.  Wow, was he?  Apparently, David Caruso's in First Blood.  He's a dude that Stallone stabs in the ass.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's true.  He was a pussy in that movie, too.  Yeah!  Yeah!  He was a real pussy.  Wow, you stabbed me in the ass.  Yeah!  All right, it's time to start our weekends.  Yep.  You got stabbed in the ass.  The question, Frank, is am I a poo puncher?  Yeah!  A poo puncher. 
[04:19:30]  Oh, man.  What was that party slob?  Sloppy Party Bottom.  Sloppy Party Bottom.  That's a great name for a CD, isn't it?  There was a rumor going around...  Probably a name on Whackbag already.  Probably not a...  Probably no truth to it whatsoever, but there was a rumor going around out in Hollywood  after the Reese Witherspoon, Ryan Phillippe, had divorced that that had something to do  with it, that he was a closet sloppy Party Bottom.  Wow.  And I think it was just one of those rumors that somebody started, because they're like,  wouldn't that be fantastic?  Yeah.  Like, if that dude was like... 
[04:20:00]  Because I guess he's kind of like the ultimate twink.  Like, he's...  He was really like that guy.  But I don't think there's any truth to it.  I don't know.  As far as I know, that dude loves pussy.  How do you stalk a rumor?  Well, he just...  It's that simple.  What you do is you throw something out there that's just like...  Could be true.  It could happen.  Totally.  It's like one guy has to throw it out.  How does it then spread to 300 million people?  Internet, sir.  Internet.  Yeah.  We stood in front of the AMC in the theater in Times Square, me and Dane Cook, and we 
[04:20:30]  would just go, you can't believe Michael Jackson hung himself as people walk by.  Oh, you do that?  Yeah.  And you can see...  We've done that again.  You can see people going, Michael Jackson hung himself?  Just walking down the street.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  No, it's hilarious.  Jimmy does that in the elevator.  He'll like...  When somebody gets on the elevator and he's stepping off, he'll say something about the president,  man.  Did you hear about gunfire?  Oh, man.  What did Kenny do walking through first class?  On one of our flights recently.  He was talking about the...  Did you hear the president's been shot?  Did you hear the president's been shot on a plane? 
[04:21:00]  He's walking by and he says that to us as he goes to his seat and everyone turns around  like, what did he...  That's illegal.  Just joking.  Oh, why are you taking me off the aircraft?  That's...  That's fucked up.  All right.  Catch and release a week from today.  Catch and release comes out next Friday.  Go see it.  Bring a girl.  You'll, you know...  I'll check it out.  You'll get laid.  Absolutely.  I'll check it out.  And Clerks 2 on DVD.  Clerks 2, as always.  We kicked ass on DVD.  That's where we kind of thrive the best, though.  What did you play in the movie, the movie that's coming out?  What do you play? 
[04:21:30]  I play the fat, funny friend that would have been Jack Black if he wasn't too expensive.  I played the sloppy party bottom.  You're a sloppy party bottom?  I wish, sir.  If I was a sloppy party bottom and shit, my acting career would take off.  People would be like, what a brave choice.  How did you research this role?  I was like, I don't know.  It took a lot of cum.  In the credits, it's that sloppy pot of money.  Sloppy party bottom.  You can't even say it.  I'm fucking exhausted.  I know.  You fucking cut.  You're all on me.  Back up.  I'm not all over you.  We're just all tired and need to go home now. 
[04:22:00]  Big Kev.  Big Apple Con today and tomorrow.  Go to BigAppleCon.com for...  Do you have a...  Are you rocking a table there?  I am, yes.  Oh, no interviews?  I'm going to see who's available.  Yeah, because his interview is the greatest interview ever.  Do they all end with...  Yeah.  They should.  They should.  They're very short, very to the point.  Are you guys...  Where are you with your MySpace?  How many friends you got?  I have...  Boy, I forgot.  You were the bar for me for a while.  When I first joined, I was like, man, how do you get that many friends? 
[04:22:30]  Got to get that many.  Now?  You've bailed on it for the most part, right?  Have you really?  You don't do it that much?  No, I haven't updated it in a while.  Well, we've been traveling a lot, and I know you can still reach that internet thing away  on the road.  What's the last thing you want to do on the road?  But I was kind of fucking busy.  And then you get to the point where you're like, uh-oh, now I got a lot of fucking things.  A friend approval to do?  I only have 27?  Yeah.  I have 26.  27,000.  No, you don't.  27,000.  All right.  I got 26.  Do you?  I get no way.  I haven't answered anything.  26,000?  I haven't signed up new friends. 
[04:23:00]  147,000.  Fucking heck.  Yes.  Yes.  Wow.  How many does Dane have?  A million and a half.  Yeah, that dude's been-  Dane's ridiculous.  That dude practically created MySpace.  I know.  Yeah, he invented MySpace.  That dude is not ever-  I mean, he must go out and-  It must be just like getting on a bus and telling everyone on the bus, join MySpace.  Yeah.  That's it.  Everybody.  He-  I can't get that shameless, man.  Except I will here.  The real Kevin Smith.  Backslash the real Kevin.  Oh, you have-  MySpace.com slash the real Kevin Smith. 
[04:23:30]  Someone has Kevin Smith?  Who has Kevin Smith?  Before I got there, there were like multiple Kevin Smiths.  You can get it.  How?  You got it.  I don't want to, man.  I'm going to get my 147.  I'm going to rock the boat.  It's good.  The real Kevin Smith.  I'm going to have to start over.  1.7 mil.  He's got-  Opie, you're not even on it, right?  No, I can't be-  I had to-  I had an Opie for a while.  I thought it was you, but then I realized he was actually-  I think we finally shut him down.  Yeah.  To make it tell.  I've been nicer, Bob.  No, you're great.  I mean, but if I was bugging you on MySpace, you'd be like, enough. 
[04:24:00]  What are you promoting?  We're going to go home now.  Atlanta.  Punchline.  February 1st, the 3rd.  And I'm going to be on Jimmy Kimmel next week, Thursday night.  Thursday night.  Do you guys literally go home?  No.  Or do you have work to do here?  I don't think we have anything to do today, right?  Not after that.  Yeah, we're so out.  That's a cush gig right there, man.  Can Poe get my truck, please?  We're so out.  All right, Kevin.  It's always a pleasure.  Kevin, it's great.  It's great to everyone.  Yes.  See you guys later.  Always a pleasure.  Very interesting.  That it? 
[04:24:30]  You're supposed to end on the applaud, I thought.  That was really anticlimactic.  You look like you're lost in thought, sir.  Now we're just trying to figure an out.  An out?  An out?  All right.  An out.  The perfect out for the show.  Yeah.  So, uh, calls maybe a one.  Yeah!  Oh!  All right.  Let's see if I can find that.  All right.  This might take a while.  Uh, Sam!  Sam!  I need help, Sam!  Fucking Anthony.  Fucking... 
[04:25:00]  There we go.  Okay.  All right, everybody.  Um...  Have a good weekend.  All right.  Um...  Uh...  We'll be back Monday...  Okay.  ...with a brand new show...  ...at six o'clock.  So, Frank...  ...we'll see you...  ...on Monday.  That was perfect.  Awesome.  Great out.  All right.  Should have actually hit it.  See, now...  Now we gotta do something else. 
[04:25:30]  Oh.  That was kind of bad.  That didn't really pan out.  No.  Yeah.  How about...  Send it like that.  How are they gonna saw your face?  It was very mysterious.  That's more cliffhanger.  Just say something they have to tune in Monday for.  Yeah.  Tune in.  Monday.  Guy dies from drinking orange juice.  Amazing.  Amazing.  Kevin, help us out here.  Give us an out.  Uh...  Good luck with your weekends.  If you're heading down sloppy party bottom way, make sure you get a little Metamucil rocking 
[04:26:00]  by four o'clock this afternoon, so the first show of the day cleans you out good.  That's a good one.  Makes you nice and smooth.  Goddamn rich cunts.  I kill rich cunts.  What is that from?  That is...  Oh, no.  Here we go.  That is from...  What movie is that?  Death Wish?  Death Wish, yeah.  Goldblum.  Death Wish.  From the first one?  That's Jeff Goldblum.  Jeff Goldblum in one of his early roles. 
[04:26:30]  One more time.  As a young thug.  He's wearing a Jughead type hat and he is beating the wife of...  What's his name there?  Death Wish.  Boy, I can't fucking think today.  Charles Brunson.  Charles Brunson.  Yeah, he's beating his wife.  Hey, Ellie.  They call him a moniker.  I dig.  And he's beating his wife's face in.  And he adds this little tidbit in.  Goddamn rich cunts.  I kill rich cunts.  Be afraid. 
[04:27:00]  Be very afraid.  Yeah.  They were thugs.  And they were the worst looking bunch of thugs.  It was like anyone could take this crew.  Was it also a rainbow coalition of thugs?  Yes, it was.  A bit of a rainbow.  You get Jeff Goldblum in there and a black guy, a Hispanic guy, an Asian guy.  Benetton ad.  How come criminals can get along?  I don't know.  In movies or old TV shows or movies, they can get along.  I got our out.  What is it?  Oh, thank God.  Thanks to Used Lad Bag.  Used Lad Bag.
