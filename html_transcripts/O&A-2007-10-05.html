<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing attack on the Cleveland-based Maxwell radio show, repeatedly calling the hosts "faggots" and "fatso(s)" while mocking their comedic style and limited reach.  Clips from the Maxwell show were played and dissected, further fueling the feud.  Opie and Anthony challenged one of the Maxwell hosts, Dan, to a comedic bit contest against Jim Norton.  The hosts' infamous "sports curse" was also discussed, along with listener calls reacting to both the feud and the curse.  The hosts referenced past controversies, including their infamous church sex stunt.  One caller suggested the Maxwell show hosts were jealous of Opie and Anthony's success, a claim the hosts readily accepted, highlighting their significantly larger audience.

The show then shifted to a listener challenge for Dan to submit his funniest bit.  "FU Friday" and "Time Alive Friday" segments were promoted, along with the upcoming "BCN's Big Creepy Night 07" Halloween party in Boston, featuring prizes such as a trip to see Led Zeppelin and a Scion XP (with a humorous anecdote about a previously gifted defective car).  A previous interview with Don King was reviewed, highlighting King's promotional comments and off-color remarks.

A discussion about a school replacing its Halloween party with a "fall party" sparked debate on political correctness and cultural assimilation, leading to numerous listener calls, including one from Sarah detailing her past drug use and sexual experiences before finding religion.  Another caller discussed politically correct censorship in textbook creation.  Football picks from Opie's brother were presented, and the hiring of new show rundown producer Steven S. from Bayshore was announced. The segment concluded with a review of a local news program's increasing entertainment focus, featuring an interview with Richard Huff, a local TV columnist, who discussed the blurring lines between news and entertainment.

The next segment began with a critique of shallow news reporting, transitioning to a discussion of favorite TV shows, including *Life*, *Journeyman*, *Kid Nation*, *Biggest Loser*, and *Lost*.  *Kid Nation*'s adult supervision was mocked, and *Survivor*'s deception was discussed.  The hosts offered varied opinions on reality TV and other shows, with *Biggest Loser* receiving significant humorous commentary.  Richard Huff joined the show, sharing his love for "junk TV," particularly *LA Ink*, leading to discussion about body modification and the artists' talent.  Steven S.'s Elvis impersonations were mentioned, along with Opie's upcoming stand-up gigs and the "E-Rock-tober" segment.  Intern Renee contributed "What the F" segments featuring petty annoyances, and audio of a teacher losing his temper, sparking a discussion about teacher-student discipline.  The segment concluded with discussions about media fear-mongering and Drew from Fark.com's new book, *It's Not News, It's FARC*, which criticized media practices.  Drew joined the show, discussing Fark.com and Fark TV, and their satirical approach to news. The hosts and Drew discussed various news stories, including bird flu, Hurricane Katrina, and sensationalized reporting.  The show's XM portion was mentioned, along with the presence of guests Drew, Rick Shapiro, and Francine.

The final segment featured Drew, Rick Shapiro, and Francine as guests.  The "Twelve Days of Christmas" song and statistics about economic losses during sporting events were dismissed as bogus.  The discussion focused on Fark.com and Drew's book, detailing the media's presentation of trivial matters as news.  A possibly fabricated Stephen King quote was mentioned.  Rick Shapiro openly discussed his erectile dysfunction and sexual enhancement methods, while Francine shared experiences of sexual harassment and her changing views on anal sex. The Janet Jackson Super Bowl wardrobe malfunction, Larry Craig's bathroom scandal, and the Columbia space shuttle disaster were discussed with sarcastic commentary.  The hosts continued to critique the media's focus on trivial stories,  while Anthony fell asleep multiple times, adding to the comedic tone.  The show concluded with promotion of Rick Shapiro's stand-up shows and Drew's book, with the hosts leaving the microphone open, filled with closing thank yous and background music.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio host, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  What happened to you?  I put a 380 in my chest and a full turn.  Hey, how did help show up for you?  The question is, why did help show up for you?  This is where entertainment is going?  Pop, pop, pop, pop.  They are sick freaks 
[00:01:00]  So you're kind of like  Transbestite  Transsexual  On your underwear do you have a sign that says  Pardon our appearance for remodeling  This is the worst  The worst show I've  This is the worst show I've ever been on  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  Ah good afternoon 
[00:01:30]  Cleveland  Good afternoon  Cleveland  They don't like hearing good morning  It's Opie and Anthony  How's everybody today  Good morning  Doing good doing good doing good  That's good that's good  That's good  Good for you good for you  Good for you  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A 
[00:02:00]  Also want to say hi to Philly this morning  Oh yeah  Want to say hi to Chicago this morning  Oops  Sports cities  Even though it's afternoon in Cleveland  Good afternoon Cleveland  Yeah the instant feedback  Even though we're not here  The instant feedback 24 hours a day  Yeah  And I noticed a lot of instant feedback coming in  Late last night  Oh boy Opie the Phillies fans are gonna love you today 
[00:02:30]  Have fun on the phones  That's Ryan  A Phillies fan from Jersey  Doing an E-Rock  What the F  A what the F  If you linger longer  You know what that's about  Of course  He writes  What the F  I've been waiting for the Phillies to win the pennant  Since I was like 15 years old  And now they're one game away from losing  What the F  My name is Opie and I like to make sports curses  And then he  Sports curses  And then he writes 
[00:03:00]  Emphasize the  S-s-s-s-s-s  S-s-s-s  Sports curses  It just goes on and on and on and on  And then of course some nice Yankee abuse  On the instant feedback overnight  Good  Your boys looked great last night there Anthony  Yeah  Yeah just wonderful  12-4 was it?  Four hits?  Something like that?  I don't think  I don't even think it was four was it?  12-3  When I said the Yankees degrade  I meant that sarcastically  Cleveland kicked your ass 
[00:03:30]  12-3  Yes 12-3  Should have won that  So  It's just a disaster  Yeah maybe Steinmetter can get another 55 year old pitcher to start  Was Randy Johnson having cataracts removed?  Oh my god  Oh my goodness gracious  They stunk up the ballpark  They certainly did  And it comes down to the pitching thing that Jimmy has been mentioning all year long  Yeah  Yeah  You keep mentioning pitching  They just are losing 
[00:04:00]  Ridiculous  That score  I was looking and  The TV I was looking at  Because I was at a bar last night  Was a little blurry  And far away  So I'm looking and I thought  No that was just the beers  It was the beers  No it was because  It was when I just got there  So I knew it wasn't the beers  I look at the TV  And I assumed it was  3-3  Thought it was 3-3 
[00:04:30]  Yeah you just took a little peek right?  Yeah yeah  And it looked like  2-3's up there  Until  I saw a few seconds later  It was  10-3  So I assumed that 3 I was looking at  Was an 8 or a 9  Something  And  And it was over  At that point  It's only the first game  Don't worry about it  Of course  It's not like  It's not like being in  Philly's situation  Right  Where  Wow  That's bad  Or Chicago's situation 
[00:05:00]  Or Chicago  Another team  Opie just  Bigs B  Picked to win  From Chicago  He writes  Please call your curse off  99 years without a World Series win  We beg you in Chicago  And then you got  Chicago D  Don't bother saying hello to us  Here in Chicago  A-hole  It has nothing to do  Why are people getting mad at me?  It has nothing to do with him picking it  I'm just picking teams  I really really enjoy watching every year  And for some reason  They end up losing when I pick them  He can't just pick a team 
[00:05:30]  And then it'll lose  He's gotta actually  Want the team to win  Right  It's a sad situation  But he wants Philly to win  Proving that  That's why I can't just go  Go Yankees  I just  I don't like the Yankees  Right  That's sacrilege  If you're a Mets fan  It kind of looks like you  Although there's a lot of  People in New York  As soon as the Mets are out of it  They jump on the Yankee bandwagon  I don't get those people  But they do  I was thinking that  You were secretly  Rooting for the Yankees  No  This showed that 
[00:06:00]  Somewhere deep inside  You were like  I kind of want the Yankees to win  I wish it was true  Because then the sports curse  Would be even better  But no  I picked the Phillies  To go all the way  And win the World Series  All the way  Well what a comeback  They're going to have  I guess  They're down  Two games to zip  Yeah  I picked the Cubbies  Because it's been a long time  Sure  And we do morning radio  For Chicago  Just feeling good about the Cubbies  Yeah  Well they lost last night too  They're down two games 
[00:06:30]  Yeah  And of course  You gotta go Red Sox  Gotta go Red Sox  Sure  And that's where  Like it's weird  Because I have to go Red Sox  Over the Yankees  So I say go Sox go  Go Sox go  By the way  If you are keeping track  Of the sports curse  The teams that I have picked  Yeah  The teams I have picked  Have won a total of one game  And have lost five  If you don't think  This sports curse is real  One game they have won  Out of six 
[00:07:00]  I don't know what it is  That black cloud  That just hangs over your head  When it comes to  Picking sports teams  Look you know what  I told you  It goes back to my days  Doing radio in Buffalo  Yeah  I was there for the  You know  The Bills losing  The Super Bowl  Three out of the four years  Because on the fourth one  I was back home  Working at BAB  But I truly believe  It started there  Because then when  I went to Boston  The Pats lost  In the Super Bowl  And it's just kind of  Followed me around 
[00:07:30]  I haven't picked a winner  In I can't tell you how long  Can't tell you  Horrid sports curse  I can't tell you  My team hasn't won  Since the 86 Mets  I do believe  I think that's the last time  One of my teams  You know  Went all the way  And you must have just  Looked away for a second  Or something  You like went for another  Team for a second  That's all it took  Was that one second  Yeah maybe God  Made a deal with me  Like look  We're going to give you this  But for the rest of your life  You're never going to see  Another winner  What's going on 
[00:08:00]  I was just looking at  Anti-Semitic CDs  Are being left around  Oh really  Yes  Well that would certainly  Get your attention  Is that going  Is that up anywhere  A lot of tracks  On that CD  Yeah I saw  Instead of being left  In people's mailboxes  I saw like  20 tracks on that CD  20 tracks  Wow  Nazi groups tend to be  Very short song  Yeah  Short songs  Right to the point  Minute 13  Right  That's like the long track  Hey let's say hi  To Mike in Chicago  Mike  Yeah what's up  Hey there Mike 
[00:08:30]  What's up Mike  Hey uh  Hopi  You don't have the curse  Of the Cubs man  It's the goat  Yeah I'm not going to  Like try to compete  With the curse  Of the goat  In Chicago  Yeah that dumb goat  Messed you guys up  For eternity  I believe  Yeah I'm a diehard  Sox fan  Those Cubs fans  All they do is blame  Everybody else  Except the fact  That their team  Is no good  It's about the goat  It's about Bartman  And the foul ball  They're going to  Blame you this year  Yeah the foul ball  Foul ball dude man 
[00:09:00]  Is he still alive  I have no idea  He fell off the face  Of the earth  I think they ran him  Out of town  Yeah I do believe so  Oh there'd be no way  He could show up  At the park  I just  Kill him  I just assumed  The mob took care of him  A while ago  Rubbed him out  Yeah  I think you're right  Alright thank you Mike  Hang in there  Go Cubbies  Hey I got one thing  For Jimmy  Uh Jimmy  Ran away from the mic  What  I just want to tell Jimmy 
[00:09:30]  Dragon Wagon says hi  Oh Dragon Wagon says hi  Alright you gotta  Linger longer for that  Thank you Mikey  Alright later  And I don't understand  Why people are getting  Mad at me  I truly believe in these teams  Why are you getting mad  Just because I picked  The Phillies  Yeah  Why are you getting mad  Because I picked the Cubs  It's not like he did this  On purpose so they lose  He can't do that  At least the Red Sox  Won their first game  So I'm one for  Yeah see  One win  Five losses so far  And if you're gonna  Keep track at home  It's the Cubs  It's the Phillies  It's the Red Sox 
[00:10:00]  Yeah  Those are the three teams  And people are trying  To get me to pick  Other games  I just didn't feel it  No  I just don't have any  You know  He's gotta feel it  That's what it is  Any care in the world  For the other teams  Philly's the big one though  That's the one you want  Going all the way  Although hockey started  And my team is tied  For the second best record  In the entire NHL  So that's good  How many games  Have been played  Well their home opener  And their opening game  Of the season is Saturday 
[00:10:30]  But they're still tied  For the second best record  In all of the NHL  How is that  They already have  The standings man  Right there  Second place  Oh okay  Well good luck bro  Let's go to Harry  In Buffalo  Tell us about  The discount  Harry  Alright  Enough about  The discount  I'll tell you  About the discount  Here's the discount  Yeah  After Buffalo  Whipped up on the 
[00:11:00]  Islanders in the  Playoffs last year  And then destroyed  The Rangers  Opie went ahead  And said  Let's go  Buffalo  And they proceeded  To collapse  Against the Ottawa  Senators  Going on  Into this year  The curse continues  For the Buffalo  Sabres  Because our star goalie  The best goalie  In the league  Now has testicle cancer  And it's all Opie's fault  Dude  You know  This kind of started  As a radio bit  But it kind of  Creeps me out now  This whole sports curse  Thing really does

[00:24:00]  Who tries to play out  Like I'm a crazy fat guy  Whoa  Dangerous  Dangerous dude  In all fairness  There's a very  Extremely slight possibility  That this guy could be funnier than you  Wow  At least I'll sit here  And be honest  Yes  I don't know what this guy does  I've never heard him before  So we're willing to give him a chance  Yes  So now  See this is where they back out  Because yesterday we're like  You know  Alright  We thought he was a stand up comic  So you send your best set  And we'll play it on the radio  And we won't goof on it 
[00:24:30]  We'll let it play in its entirety  So now this is where they back out  Because you know  Yeah  They're just babbling through these microphones  They don't mean half the crap they're saying  Because they're just a bunch of peas  If you know what I mean  Phony radio  So now the guy  This is  He figured this is the way out of it  I'll  Well no  What I'm saying is  He's funnier than Jim  When it comes to being  In a radio studio  Alright  So we changed  We changed it up a little bit  To this guy Dan  Because the Maxwell guy 
[00:25:00]  He's just a waste of time  So we're talking to you now Dan  Directly  Your boss there  Is saying  That you're funnier  At a radio station  On a radio show  Than our own Jim Norton  You send the funniest thing  You've ever done on the radio  To the Opie and Anthony show  And we'll play it on our show  It'll be heard by millions  Funniest thing ever  The bit that you heard  And when it happened  Or you recorded it  You just went  Oh my god  This is it  Because this Maxwell  This guy  This Dan guy  He's the music director 
[00:25:30]  He's I think the producer  How did Maxwell stumble on this gift?  What did Maxwell do to deserve this gift?  That Dan is  He's a jack of all trades  This  Everyone else looks at Dan  And thinks  Wow  Just a fat pig  Who's good for nothing  Right  But he's a gift  He's a gem  And Maxwell got him  Yeah Maxwell's a waste of time  He's a fat soul  That is useless to us right now  Okay  This guy Dan  Dan listen to me  We can make things happen  We can make dreams happen  You send the funniest thing  You've ever done on the radio 
[00:26:00]  Even if it was college radio  We will play it on our show  To see how funny you really are  College radio  Did you see a picture of this  Incest survivor?  He's lucky if he got out of fourth grade  Is that more shock humor?  Oh Jimmy  Don't be so shocking  Well  We talked to Dan Mason  Who's the head of CBS radio  You know who Dan Mason is  Of course  There Dan in Cleveland  And we also talked to Fareed  Who runs Citadel  So look  We can make things happen  So this Maxwell guy  Is a waste of time  He's saying you're really funny 
[00:26:30]  On a radio show  Send in the funniest thing  You've ever done  We'll play it on our show  And we'll be the judges  And our listeners  Will be the judges  Yeah  And these big huge radio execs  Will be the judges  They're gonna get to hear it  Because if you're truly  Anywhere as near as funny  As Jim Norton  You're gonna be saying  Goodbye to Cleveland  My friend  You know  There is such a shortage  Of talented radio programs  And people for radio programs  That if you're good  If you're that good  If you're better than Jimmy Norton  Then you got a spot  In national syndication somewhere 
[00:27:00]  So stop the hiding up there  In Cleveland  And babbling  And talking through microphones  And not meaning what you're saying  That's the new challenge  Alright  You're not a stand up  We didn't know that  We don't know anything  About you guys  I'm sorry  But we just don't  Yeah  But Dan  To you personally  He's saying you're really funny  On the radio  Send us the funniest thing  You've ever done  You have nothing to lose  Let's see what he says  To that one  Before yesterday  We've never heard  Of these guys  It's gonna be quite embarrassing  When they have to like 
[00:27:30]  Talk their way out of this one  Why would we do that  He continues here  Where you send a bit to them  And see who's funnier  But you know what  That's not the thing  The thing is  Now who's that whore  Let's do it  I'm not a stand up comic  That's right  He's not a stand up comic  He never claimed to be a stand up comic  He is  He's a stand up comic  What are you talking about  He's on ONA  He does his own big  No I'm talking about me  You jackass  You jackass  God  Pay attention  Idiot  Was that Stansberry  I just want to be a butt boy 
[00:28:00]  For ONA  Even though they don't care  About us at all  In Cleveland  Is that Stansberry  Butt boy  Was that Maxwell  That's a scream  Which one was that  I really don't know  That's Stansberry  Wow  I couldn't tell you  I don't know  And by tomorrow  I don't care at all  That was funny  A butt boy  Oh that's great  Gem  Good stuff  Let's see what this is  Wow  It seems like one of the callers 
[00:28:30]  Upset them a little bit  And let me explain what happens  Our listeners don't care about you guys  They're using your show to have fun  Yeah  Do you get it?  We don't care about your stupid radio show  This is why you guys will be stuck in Cleveland  For a really long time  You don't get it  Our listeners sit around  They do this for sport  They do this for fun  It's a hobby  It's a hobby  Yeah  They all get together on their cell phones  And on their webcams  And they're just toying with you 
[00:29:00]  They don't give a crap about you  Until the hour hits  That you're on the air  And then they all have fun  It's 3 to 7 in Cleveland  Central time  I think Cleveland is  It's 800-348-1007  The Maxwell Show  And as you can tell by that clip  They're just funny guys  Yeah  You look at them  And you go  They're just two fat pigs  But they're really funny guys  Oh god  Did you hear that?  And can I say it again?  I like repeating myself  I think the faithful listeners  Know that by now  But that guy  That got through to their show 
[00:29:30]  He's not a butt boy  For the O.B. and Anthony show  He's doing it for his own enjoyment  Yeah  His own amusement  And also knowing that  In the O.N.A. community  He just got a little  Little bump up in stats  Yeah  People listened and laughed  He's not doing it for us  You idiot  You idiot  I just want to be a butt boy  For O.N.A.  Even though they don't care  About us at all in Cleveland  Right  Even though this is the only town  Where they're not number one  Because they're getting their ass kicked  By a recovering lame-ass drug addict  And a douche from Cleveland 
[00:30:00]  What?  And you know what?  Let me tell you something about it  He's a recovering drug addict  And a douche from Cleveland  I guess that's them  That's like their affectionate way  Of saying that we're two nobodies  I'm the addict  I'm the douche  Yeah  You know just two hardcore guys  Self-deprecating a little  I'm a recovering addict too stupid  What do you think of that?  Stupid  And we do care about Cleveland  Stupid stupid dummy stupid  That made me laugh  And I can handle my drugs and booze  Pussy  We always  I can't  We always make Cleveland  One of our stops  Unfortunately this summer  With the virus tour 
[00:30:30]  You know that was out of our hands  But we went there  With the virus tour  When we got back on radio  We made sure we hit Cleveland  We do care about Cleveland  Of course we do  But that's just  That's emotional blackmail  With the city  It's like  They don't care about you  What does that have to do  With being funny  Like where is that  You know  That's trying too hard  Stop trying to tap  Your local neighbor  On the shoulder  And go  Hey neighbor  Stick together  You know  We're just two Clevelanders  Right  Yeah  Here we go  And you know what  Let me tell you something  About Jim Norton  I'll tell you something  Right now 
[00:31:00]  Go ahead  The guy's first  Hours worth of comedy  Is funny  But so is every other comics  Because they have an entire  Life to write it  I've seen the promo  For his new thing  On HBO  Boy  Ain't funny  Wow  Now you're just  Embarrassing yourself  Yeah  I won't even argue  The HBO commercial  Just you can stay  Out of this one Jimmy  Everyone is saying  Holy crap  Is this  Just the promo  For it  Jim Norton  Why are we arguing this  Jim Norton's on HBO  You're stuck in Cleveland  Cleveland fatso 
[00:31:30]  But I like the fact  He said my first hour  Is funny  Thank you  Yeah  An hour  I did a half  On HBO  In 2005  Is that what you mean  Is that what you watched  Fanboy  And look  It's pretty obvious  That you know a lot  About Jim Norton  And the Opie and Anthony show  So why don't you tell it  Like it is  Jim Norton comes up  With an hour of material  Every six months  A whole new hour of material  Yeah  He's hitting the road again  To start a whole nother hour  In the very near future  Dope  He thinks he's funny  Because he likes making jokes 
[00:32:00]  About  What  Dude  The guy's completely  About  What do I like  Making jokes about  He likes making jokes about  That he says nothing  Yeah  Like what  Because he's panicking  This is a jock  That's panicking  About what  This is pathetic  What do I like  Making jokes about  Hey Maxwell  We've never lost one of these  Trust me on that  We have never lost one of these  Enjoy your time  In the limelight  And then you just go back 
[00:32:30]  To obscurity  This is what we do  With you people  You know  Dude  The guy's completely  About the shock factor  Why don't you say the word  Stupid again  Stupid  Stupid  Stupid  Stupid  That's funny  Right  Looks like the guy  Listens to our show  He knows a lot  And he certainly knows  What my crutch is  All kidding aside  Good one  But here's the thing  Hey fat boy  Are you a little jealous  Are you a little jealous  When you're talking  Were you hoping  That your career  Was going to go somewhere  Past Cleveland  By this point  Are you a little jealous  We don't even know about you  I'd never heard of you 
[00:33:00]  Until yesterday  Phone ain't ringing  Off the hook  Is it  Sounds like  You know a lot  About Jimmy  In this radio show  Yeah  I appreciate that  I appreciate a fanboy  I get stupid  Stupid  Stupid  Stupid  That's funny  Right if we just sit there  And go stupid  Stupid  Hey stupid  What's up stupid  Stupid  That's funny  Right stupid  I actually like that  Yeah that'll be in our machine  So when we're done with you  Maxwell  At least you'll live on  With that dumb thing  In a sound clip  You really will  Long after you die  In your sleep  Because your stupid tongue 
[00:33:30]  Collapses on your throat  Down syndrome tongue  That your throat can't support  When you're sleeping  He will be playing you  In that replay machine  But the shock value thing  Is what annoys me  It's like  Because it's just not  It's just not accurate  Like that's  I suck  I'm a funny  Alright we get it  We know  But shock value  And then meanwhile  On his own radio station page  Stansbury  This comedic gift  He's been given  Right  There's a picture  On his bio page  Remember the Cracker 
[00:34:00]  Cracker man  Cracker man  The black guy  Their African American friend  Well apparently  He's not with the station anymore  There's a picture  On Stansbury's page  And under it  It says  Racist pics  And it has a gorilla  Holding a Cracker man  Sign that says  Cracker man  APM  WMMS  So that's  I'm shock value  Yet on your radio station's page  You have a black guy's name  Being held by a guy  In a gorilla costume  Implying that that is 
[00:34:30]  Cracker man  And you're calling me  Shock value  That's shocking  My goodness  Is that shocking  Is that what it is  Fat boy  I'm shocking  But that's what's on  That's what's on your radio station's page  And then you go into  Name that whore  That's what I  That's what I hate  About a fat  Inconsistent fraud  If you don't like my act  That's fine  But don't say shock value  And then do  Here's that whore  And I'm sorry  I can't come up with something like  Hootenanny  By the way  I'm looking at a lot of pictures 
[00:35:00]  Of this guy  You know what's worse  Than being a fat guy  Is being a fat short guy  Oh my god  Little fella  I don't know  Whatever man  At the end of the day  The guys had to send people  To have sex  Into a church  Did we have to  Well it looks like  You guys once again  Know a lot about  Boy they certainly  Know a lot about the show  At the end of the day  We had to  You know that was just a bit  That we had done  Three years in a row  And that part of it 
[00:35:30]  The church thing  Was a throw away  That was on a list  It wasn't  Everyone thinks  It was this big  Calculated thing  To get this big publicity  And you know  And this is why  I hate radio  And I was telling Ann today  That I can't wait  To get out  And it's the God's honest truth  I can't wait  Because of the BS  That goes on  With these stupid radio shows  This is what happened  Maxwell  Like Ann said  We did it three years  In a row  And we didn't have  To send a couple  Into a church  To have sex 
[00:36:00]  We were number one  In every city  That we were being  Broadcast in  We effed up royally  Yeah we didn't have  To do anything  We didn't have to do  That for ratings  We were just stupid  That day  Stupid  Not to do it  Jim Norton  Stupid  Stupid  Stupid  But no  At the end of the day  We didn't have to do  That for ratings  We already had the ratings  And we blew up our careers  We were stupid that day  That's what you should have said  Have sex  Into a church  Into a church  Guys had to send people  Into a church 
[00:36:30]  To have sex  To get ratings  Because when you can't be funny  And when you don't have  A natural chemistry  And you can't entertain  Without going over the line  What do you  No natural chemistry  We've been doing this  For 12 years  Maxwell  Will you stop lying  To your audience  Stop using this  And stop hiding  And just making up crap  Because we'll call you out on it  And our listeners  Will call you out on it  And Cleveland  Will call you out on it  Can I explain something  We've been doing radio  Since 94  You idiots  And we've never  We've never had to send out  A press kit 
[00:37:00]  Or a tape  Or anything  To get a gig  We have been asked  To come to cities  And take a job  How many  How many little kits  Have you put together  And sent out  Hoping to get your ass  Out of Cleveland  You know  How many times  Did you wish  You were in another market  Or syndicated  We've never had to ask  For any of that stuff  Based on our own merits  And what we do  On the radio 
[00:37:30]  On a daily basis  Radio stations  And companies  Came to us  To our show  And said  We want to put you guys here  We want to syndicate you  We want to hire you  We were doing very well  We didn't have to go  Into a church  To have sex  To try to get ratings  That was a major league  Screw up on our part  Jesus  You don't have a natural  Pull that back in a second  And you can't entertain  Without going over the line  What do you do  What do you do 
[00:38:00]  You send people  Name that whore  That's what you do  Name that whore  And dress somebody  In a gorilla suit  In place of a black man  Is that what you do  Is that natural chemistry  Is that natural chemistry  And comedy  Instead of just shock value  Get out of here  Go eat more  You fat pig  And you can't entertain  Without going over the line  What do you do  You send people  Into a church  To have sex  Sex  And punt 
[00:38:30]  Oh no  He punted  And punt  He is so  He doesn't realize  How stupid that sounds  Oh who doesn't want to  Punt his pumpkin head  That's what amazes me  He doesn't understand  How stupid that catchphrase  And punt  And punt  Yeah you got us man  And I'm spent  Yeah you guys  We're being hurt  All over Canada  All over America  Across the world  Because of the internet  You got us Maxwell 
[00:39:00]  You got us  Wow  But when you have  Natural chemistry  And you can entertain  Without going over the line  Throw out a catchphrase  In a phony radio voice  Don't talk in your natural voice  Talk in a phony radio voice  Phony voice  How about this  Talk like you talk at home  Put out bits  That are no substance  And just  Sound bites  Here we go  More of the Maxwell show  That has decided  To talk about us  Out of nowhere  Yeah  I really don't know 
[00:39:30]  What that's about  But whatever  We'll take your bait  For a couple days  And then the pest  Will have fun  Let our listeners  Bat you around  Like little kittens  Bat around  A catnip mouse  That's what you are  You're a fat catnip mouse  For our listeners  And please look at  Dan's picture  He's got the picture  With the hat  And like the tilted head  And the shades  Like he's wearing the shades  Like why are you  Trying to be cool  Trying to be cool  Aren't you  Why  You're something  You're trying to be something  You'll just not 
[00:40:00]  And you'll never be  You look like a fat  Travis Bickle  Nobody thinks  Like who is this  Cool intriguing guy  Wow  Here we go  Someone that lingers longer  Bill from Waterford  Of course  Wow Maxwell is destroying  You guys like he did  His wife  And pound for pound  Doing the job  That you do  Right here  You're funnier  Than Jim Norton  This is the  You're funnier  Than Jim Norton  Thing  Well pound for pound  With this guy Dan 
[00:40:30]  See Maxwell  You didn't think this out  You dummy  That's why you're stuck  In Cleveland  Okay  This is the new  This is the new idea  If you think  Your guy's funnier  Have him send in  The funniest thing  He's done  On radio  Yeah  And we will play it  In its entirety  On our show  See we don't hide behind these  I keep doing this  Because we don't hide behind these  We're smarter than you  You dope  I'd grab any random thing  That Jim Norton's done  On the show  Just at random  Grab it out 
[00:41:00]  And play it  Against what this idiot  Is doing  And I guarantee  It would be  20 times funnier  Than anything  This jackass  Comes up with  And Dan if you're listening  Because I know you  Well you are listening  Let's be honest  You have nothing to lose  Send it in  Because you know what  I know you want to  Maybe go  To bigger places  Than Cleveland  We got a lot of  Important people  That listen to our show  On a daily basis  I can even get  Eric Logan on the line  Actually we should  Get Logan on the line  If Dan is funnier 
[00:41:30]  Than Jimmy on the radio  I could get  Eric Logan  To get you  A really sweet gig  Get him a gig  Alright so you have  Nothing to lose  So I would love  To hear what you're  Going to say  About this one  How are you  Going to spin this  You're funnier  Than Jim Norton  I would agree with that  I like the fact  No more humility  You're better at this job  Than he is  On a stage  That might not be the case  No but the guy's  Been doing that 15 years  Yeah  If you actually  Quit smoking the reefer  And got up on stage  For 15 years  You'd be funnier  Than Jim Norton 
[00:42:00]  Can't quit smoking pot  This guy's a maniac  They're so cool  These guys are out of control  Oh boy  I could quit smoking pot  High five  How about that  Fatso  Quit smoking pot  I've not heard you  Say one  Funny thing  I can't imagine  That Cleveland's  Really enjoying  This type of radio  No  Absolutely not  15 years  You'd be funnier  Than Jim Norton  You would  You would  I mean it's ridiculous  So whatever man 
[00:42:30]  We'll get to it  And you know what  With all due respect  I'm sorry  But these guys  Are  It's like well  Whatever man  We'll get to it  After I smoke some more pot  Yeah  You know  This guy's out of control  So cool  You see the sunglasses  He's probably  Stoned again  I'm not ready to  Let the world  See my talent yet  So I'm just gonna  Go back to my  Basement apartment  Smoke some more dope  For a few more years  Yeah  So whatever man  We'll get to it  And you know what  With all due respect  I'm sorry  But these guys are  Let me see here  They're on Sirius Satellite Radio  They broadcast to an entire continent  And they do a morning show 
[00:43:00]  XM  Simulcast  And I don't know  How many cities  Over 20  A lot  Yeah  Over 20  They're heard all across the country  Yeah  And if you gotta talk about  A couple douchebags  In Cleveland for an hour  Yeah  Because  You're getting your ass kicked  Like beat bad in Cleveland  Like it's not even close  Did they say that in unison  Yeah  Let me  Let me explain something to Maxwell  Because he doesn't  You know  Tell the truth  We have way more listeners  In Cleveland  We're on XM Satellite Radio 
[00:43:30]  We got a massive following  In Cleveland  On XM  And we have a very good following  On the commercial radio station  Up there  Okay  You combine the two  It's not even close  And that's the challenge  That we have with this radio show  That we're split  Between two companies  Yeah  We're doing very well for XM  And we're doing very well  For CBS Radio  But guys like this  Will just look at the commercial radio  Ratings and go  Look look  See they're not doing that well 
[00:44:00]  But they know damn well  That if you add the XM listeners  Which is just as important to us  It's not even a contest  In any of these cities  It's not even a contest  Guess what  President Steve in Philly  Kicking our ass on regular radio  You throw in the XM listeners  There's  It's not even close  We have a much bigger fan base in Philly  That's the reality of this  This whole thing  That we decided to do  We compete with ourselves  It's a massive challenge  That we have undertaken here 
[00:44:30]  Between XM and regular radio  Okay  So some of these cities  And some of these shows  Will brag that they're beating us  On regular radio  And that is the truth  In some of these cities  But then if you add the XM listeners  It's not even close  Okay  And this is what they're going for right now  I guess  I don't even know  That they're beating us  In afternoons on regular radio  Okay  Good for him  Good for you  Good afternoon  But if you add the XM listeners  It's not even close 
[00:45:00]  Maxwell  You know that  We haven't gotten a call  From one Maxwell listener  Yeah you know that  Why?  I mean if you're trashing us  And this was something  That they started  We had never heard of them  It just starts it  With I'm not funny  And the show hasn't been funny  Okay  Why are your listeners  Not bombarding us?  Why?  We haven't gotten one  Honest to God  We haven't gotten one call  From your listeners  Not one Maxwell listener  Must have a very loyal fan base  If not one of them will call  We bashed you yesterday  For an hour  We're bashing you again today  In response  Why wouldn't you have  A listener calling us?  Why wouldn't they  Just do it on their own?  And that is our challenge 
[00:45:30]  When we sign this deal  We knew it would be tough  We got to make  Both companies very happy  And it's not an easy one  Ass kicked  Like beat bad in Cleveland  Like it's not even close  Where our bosses  Are even nice to us now  The bosses are nice to them  Stansberry does it again  Stupid  Stupid dummy  Dummy  Stupid  Stupid  Stupid  Alright I feel better  You feel better?  Stupid  Stupid dummy  Dummy  Dummy  Dummy  Stupid  And then you know  What they do  They use their fans 
[00:46:00]  And their fans  To get a part of their army  Dude those guys  Don't care anything about you  We don't have an army  We have pests  And the pests  Care about us  As much as we care about them  Okay  We kind of work together here  Anthony  They help the show  But they are also  Helping each other  Let me also  Just say something  About that whole situation  How much money  Does the company  Have to pay you  To go to some  Crappy bar gig  To hang out  With your listeners  How much money 
[00:46:30]  Does that take?  Because guaranteed  When you're  Throwing out  Your crappy  And punt  T-shirts  At some  Dump  Dive  Bar  That they  Send you to  That some  Sales  Sleaze  Sends you to  You get a few  Hundred  Shekels in your  Pocket  When you leave  And that's you  Hanging out  With your listeners  On any given night  If something's going on  A poker game  Last night 
[00:47:00]  I'm just hanging out  In a bar  With some listeners  At a karaoke bar  Or if there's just  A party going on  With listeners  Just hanging out  There's no money  There's no promoting  It on the air  There's no sales  People saying to be  There  It's just a matter  Of wanting to go out  And hang out  With people  That have similar  Interests  This show  They appreciate  What is done  On this show  And you hang out  With them  Some of them  Are complete  A-holes 
[00:47:30]  And some of them  Are pretty cool  And that's it  And the virus tour  This past summer  Proved the fact  That we love  Hanging out  With our listeners  Anyone that was  Out one of those tours  I don't have to  Explain that to you  So don't even try  It's an all day event  Where we hang  In the parking lot  With the fans  We do the show  For everybody  In their city  We didn't make  A lot of money  Off that  We did it  For the fans  And just because  We like that  Interaction with  Our listeners  Don't try to  Divide and conquer  Between us  And our fan base  You jerk  And we signed 
[00:48:00]  After every event  For two hours  Two  Well sometimes  Even longer than that  But yeah  An average of two hours  At the XM studio  All because we can't  Do it here  Because of the building  We have bleachers  For fans to watch  The show  What are you talking about  They come in  As a live audience  Just to sit and watch  The show  Out of town people  People from  Other states  That we broadcast to  That are in New York  Visiting  Doing a little  That tourist thing  They could just  Come up and hang out  With us  That's our relationship  With our listeners  Fatty

[00:49:00]  That next one  You can't sleep  Trying  As your fat  Throat flesh  Chokes you  See we tell  Like it is  On this show  You know Maxwell  You can say  Whatever you want  Because you have  A microphone  In front of you  But you're just  Telling a bunch  Of lies  And Cleveland  Will  Be aware of that  Eventually  I'm looking  Sorry  See I'm  Distracted by  Baseball highlights  That's how much  I care about this  Actually  And then you know  What they do  They use their fans  And their fans  Is a good part  Of their army  Dude those guys  Don't care anything  About you

[00:50:00]  Our careers  And I love  The DJs  That bring up  Sex for Sam  We just know  This business  There are a lot  Of guys out there  A lot  I won't say all of them  But a lot of guys  That were really jealous  Of what we did  And the exposure  We got  And us on CNN  And Fox News Channel  And every news outlet  In the world  There's a jealousy  That happened  When we did that stunt  And for those years  Where that actually worked  It was some great radio  Man was that great radio 
[00:50:30]  Absolutely  Pests  Oh you're so pesky  Yeah that's why  They've been back  On the air here  What over a year  Year and a half  We haven't heard from  Any one of their people ever  Because no one in Cleveland  Listens to you  Because no one  Heard of you  Oh my god  The reason the pests  Never called you  Is because no one  Knew who the hell  You were  Right  You had to  Start ragging on us  For us to even know  Who the hell you were  I would even bet money  That when we did 
[00:51:00]  The virus tour last summer  That they were in the audience  I would bet money on that  But we're doing nothing  In Cleveland  It's just sad now  We had a huge crowd  When we went up there  For our comedy show  Every time  See we do comedy shows  For our listeners  In the cities  We're broadcasting to  You guys go to  Fuck  It would be a hell of a dump sheet  You guys  Go to sports bars  And throw out t-shirts  There's a big difference there

[00:52:00]  In Cleveland  Maybe  Maybe  And that would  I think that's pushing it  To be honest with you  Okay  Yeah  We have over a million  Just on XM alone  Not in the Cleveland area  I'm not going to  Misrepresent here  But in all of America  Well over a million people  Listen to the Opie and Anthony show  And probably  Close  Probably  Close to a million and a half  Listen on regular radio  Okay  You guys  If  If  If you're having a good week  Maybe talk to 50,000 people  Yeah  Stupid  Stupid

Those are the produced  These are produced?  They're three seconds long  Yeah I guess  Alright well  Someone produced the Don  Wait wait  I gotta hear this first  Don King  From yesterday  Don King 
[00:59:30]  Yes  Is this what he did in the other studio?  Don't touch that dog  Or we'll be right back  92, 3, K-Rock  I think this was what he did here  Oh really?  When he was just ranting  Opie and Anthony  Y'all  92, 3, K-Rock  Alright  Wow  Someone obviously slaved last night 
[01:00:00]  And put these together  Almighty  And the disc goes flying  It's not good production  If I can do it  It's not good production  If it's two seconds  Anyone can do that  I think these are the raw tracks  We had Don King on our show  And he gave us great radio yesterday  And he was just babbling  And promoting the Opie and Anthony show  Opie, Opie and Anthony  A weekday 6am  And keeps going on  And on  And on  And on  Well you got a great radio show  You know  Yesterday, the day, and tomorrow  You give the people the information 
[01:00:30]  That they need to know  When you need to know something  Call Opie and Anthony  They will give it to you  Like it is  We can't do it over the radio  People have to call us  And we have to do it one at a time  Yes  That's how we do our show  It's through phone lines  According to Don King  Roland said that when Don King  Was leaving yesterday  He said  Man, you got to keep it real  With those guys  Because they bring it  They bring it  We asked him  That was great  When you asked him  What you asked him  About how does it feel  To kill somebody  People who didn't hear it  I told him  How does it feel  To kill a man  Oh, we had so much fun 
[01:01:00]  With your bare hands  It was great  Do we have that clip  From yesterday?  Why don't we get a couple  Don King highlights  From yesterday  It's worth replaying today  Before we get out of here  Opie and Anthony  Y'all  92-3  And only because  We got such a great military  And I'm looking forward  To seeing them  Supporting them  And wishing them well  Because they put themselves  In harm's way  For the benefit of  Opie and Anthony and I 
[01:01:30]  And a free society  To continue to bring you  The best in information  News, music  Everything is happening now  Opie and Anthony  Has it for you  Don King is an older guy too  He's not like  You know, he's not 40 years old  I mean, he's an older gentleman  Yeah  And he's really sharp, man  I'm telling you  It's really wonderful  Opie and Anthony  92-3  K-Rock  He just kept going  Don't take a break  But don't touch that dog  Because we'll be right back  92-3 K-Rock  And with Opie and Anthony 
[01:02:00]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen  We're about to take a break now  At Opie and Anthony  And Jim Norton  That's our comic  He's going to keep you smiling  And we want you to be right there  When we come back  So don't touch that dial  We'll be right back  Don't touch that dial  Hey, this is Don King  You're listening to  Opie and Anthony  Oh my god  When does it end?  Hey, this is Don King  You're listening to  My pal  Little Jimmy Norton  I think that's it finally 
[01:02:30]  I want that as my outgoing message  Yeah  Dude, Don King  Quotes Shakespeare  He murdered two people  I'm not saying  It wasn't justifiable either  I mean, I'm not saying  That they didn't deserve it  You know, whatever it was  Not saying they did  But I'm not saying they didn't  I don't know  It wasn't there  I'm sure they did  It was back in the 50s  Or something, wasn't it?  One was in 54  And one was in 67  Oh, 67  Yeah  He doesn't play games, man  Okay  But he quotes Shakespeare  He quotes Thoreau  And you never know  If he's quoting them accurately  But he sounds like he is  Yeah 
[01:03:00]  I don't know any of their words  It's close enough  Would a rose smell just as sweet?  I've heard that  Something like that  I don't know, would it?  Oh, well  Let's get this out of the way  Alright, hold on a minute  Is Tom Alive Friday?  He is  Sweet out  Sweet in  Sweet out  Sweet in  Don't you know  I'm still standing  Oh, it's Tom  I'm still alive  On the Opie and Anthony show 
[01:03:30]  Let's get right to it  Tom is alive  Why are we stuck with this bit?  Hey, Tom  Yes  Tom?  Tom  Did he hang up?  Just said yes and hung up?  Yeah, I guess so  Oh, well  Well, there you go  Is Tom Alive Friday?  Sweet out  Sweet in  Sweet out  Sweet in 
[01:04:00]  Don't you know  I'm still standing  Little man  Little man  Oh, it's Tom  Tom  Still alive  On the Opie and Anthony show  There you go  Tom's alive  Very quick and painless  Didn't you hang up on him  Like last week?  I guess maybe he's  Getting me back  He got back at you  But he doesn't understand  He's not getting me back  By doing that  He just  He just saved us  Ten minutes of  Just  Unawkward  Awkward  And boring radio 
[01:04:30]  We thought he would be  Dead by now  We thought  Someone is reminding us  Because BCN's  Giving away that car  The time we gave away  A car for AAF  Up there in Worcester  Massachusetts  Oh, God  Remember that  And of course  They had to throw us  On TV for that one  And blame us  Even though it was  A station event  Because I guess  We were the ones  That gave it away  It was  What was it  A Camaro  Or something  I think it was  It might have been  A Mustang  A Mustang  That's right 
[01:05:00]  Okay  It was a Mustang  It was an old Mustang  Yeah  And this was one of  Dave Douglas'  Brilliant  Brilliant  Station ideas  Yeah, it was like  A classic Mustang  That had been restored  Right  And it was their  Big spring promotion  Yeah  When this restored Mustang  And people were going nuts  Car enthusiasts  All over  New England  Yeah  We go to that  That sports bar  Off  Off  The Mass Pike  There  As you're heading  Into Boston  I always forget  The name of it  It's a pretty famous 
[01:05:30]  Sports bar  And we're in the  Park a lot  And we finally  Give away the car  And the big  The big get  Was starting the car  Live on the air  Yep  And the thing  Wouldn't start  Wouldn't start  And then you realize  You start looking  At the car  A little closer  Because they did  Paint it  Yeah, they painted  Yellow it  Whatever color it was  But it was a fresh  Paint job on it  And then you started  Looking in the trunk  And underneath  And realized  They had just  Painted over rust  And rot 
[01:06:00]  The thing didn't run  The engine didn't run  The inside upholstery  It was all ripped up  And smelled like  It had been wet  Yeah  It was just a disaster  Of a car  Yeah  And I believe  The person that won  This thing  Tried to sue the radio station  Yep  And that's when  The news got involved  Because it was  A piece of crap  And they said  ONA giving away  A car  That was a piece  Of garbage  Yeah, they throw  Our names in it  Like it was our  Idea  It's like Dave Douglas  That jackass  He's the one that 
[01:06:30]  Hey, give away this car  Oh, it's a car giveaway  You know  We don't normally  Have to go and inspect  The prize vehicles  That are given away  I guess we should  But you assume  It's a new vehicle  Or if it's a refurbished car  That it's going to be  Something really nice  A classic car  It was a piece of garbage  That was another  Embarrassing moment  Yeah  Well, BCN giving away  A car  As part of their  Big creepy night out  But that's new  Their Halloween party 
[01:07:00]  Three weeks from tonight  Keep listening to BCN  For all the details  And your chance to win a car  Alright, we've got to  Do a little catch up here  It's the Opie and Anthony show  If you've got something  877-212-ON-A  Ah, you're checking out  The Opie and Anthony show  Phone number 877-212-ON-A  Is Tom Alive?  Tom is back on the line here  Hey, Tom  Hey, Opie, how are ya? 
[01:07:30]  What's going on, Tom?  What happened?  Sorry about that  My cell phone died  Alright, no worries  Should be joining us soon  We should do  Is Tom's Phone Alive?  Oh  That's all it was  His phone died  Got an update  And hung up on him  Yeah, yeah, yeah  It's amazing  Like, people wonder  Why are people against immigration  Or trashing immigration  Or trashing  Like, when will liberals realize  People wouldn't mind  Immigration  They wouldn't mind  Any of this stuff 
[01:08:00]  If they didn't try  To change American culture  Yeah  This is where the resentment  Comes from  It's not about  Not wanting people  In the country  It's about people  Coming to the country  And then sniveling  And bellyaching  About the culture  You must assimilate  Halloween party  Dumped at school  In Broomfield  Just these  Pukey  Wishy-washy  People in education  There won't be  Little ghosts and goblins  At Cole  Elementary school  This Halloween  In a newsletter  Sent to parents  Principal wrote  That traditional Halloween 
[01:08:30]  Parties celebrated  In classrooms  Will be replaced  By a fall party  What the hell  Is a fall party  Celebrating fall  And because the party  Is focused on fall  Not Halloween  Children can't wear costumes  Parents expressed frustration  That they weren't included  In the decision  Brooke Kimber  Who's the  I don't know who she is  Said it's hard to explain  A random October 5th party  To a child  The decision came  After a discussion  That culminated  In an emotional meeting  With teachers 
[01:09:00]  That focused on  School holiday parties  And how Cole Elementary  Could continue to celebrate  Without leaving anyone out  Because that's what it's like  When you go to  An Islamic country  Or any other country  They just change their culture  To accommodate you  How about this  You can respect  Other people's cultures  But recognize  That they're coming here  And a Halloween party  Is a tradition  That we like  And if you take 
[01:09:30]  That brings a lot of joy  And happiness  Especially to children  Yes  And Halloween  Is technically  Some sort of a  Satanic thing  And for years  Christians  You know  If you want to get into that  The whole Easter Bunny thing  I mean  You know  What Easter is really about  But we don't  We don't really care  We just care about  The big giant rabbit  Because the real thing  About Easter  Is a little scary  It's pretty much  A zombie story  Christ woke up  And he pushed  A big rock away  Yeah 
[01:10:00]  And went  Brains  Brains  Brains  So this fall festival  What's that about  What are they going to do  They don't tell you  What they're going to do  Are they allowed to wear costumes  No  No costumes  So no costumes  So no costumes  But somehow they'll still  Dole out the candy  I'm sure  Yeah  And they're going to have  Little fruity leaves  Multi-colored leaves  Painted around  Right  Just in case there's somebody  There from another culture  What culture are they talking about 
[01:10:30]  I don't know  I don't know  Somebody that's just upset  Yeah  Somebody whose parents  Want to raise them in America  Because they like the education  They can get here  They like the medical treatment  They can get here  And yet they resent the culture  And don't want their stupid kid  To assimilate to it  Maybe someone could explain this to me  What I don't understand  When these things hit the news  Is one person is upset  About something  So they get a huge change to happen  Which ends up upsetting  A lot more people  Because the people that complain  We're not going to  We're never going to make  Everybody happy  So why do we have to  Now make more people 
[01:11:00]  Not happy  I never understood that  Growing up  Never understood that  Like taking Imus' show  Off the radio  You know  It satisfied a small group  Of people that didn't even  Listen to Imus  And it made a lot of people  Really really really sad  Yes  Probably not the best example  Obviously  I should stick with  Some of the examples  That are similar to  What you're talking about today  But these stories pop up  One person can make  This incredible change  That makes a lot of people  Really sad  And not a change  That means anything 
[01:11:30]  Just I'm a self-centered baby  Who doesn't like something  And so I'm just trying  To wreck it  Halloween thing  It's like  It's not all inclusive  How?  Some people can't dress up  I don't think  It's against their religion maybe  Oh good  Or maybe some children  Are too poor  To afford the costumes  Alright then just take  The day off  Stay home that day  Stay home  Let the kids dress up  I remember that being  A fun little part  Of elementary school  Halloween  You dress up  And you go into  Go into school 
[01:12:00]  All dressed up  Had fun  Had fun exactly  Candy  Give out some candy  Which maybe what you should do  Is if they're too poor  You don't want to see  Anybody excluded  How about they tie  Little plastic baggies  Around their heads  And go as BTK victims  Pat  Bill Moore  He was laughing at that  What's up Pat  But Jimmy's not funny right  Yeah what's up Pat  Yeah I just wanted to tell you  That actually  Halloween originally started  In ancient Ireland  It was a Celtic holiday  Called the Festival of Samhain 
[01:12:30]  Samhain is the Celtic  Spirit of evil  It was a harvest festival  Where they were celebrating  The change in the seasons  Death coming about life  So on and so forth  So really  It doesn't make any sense  That they would worry  About defending somebody  Religiously  It started out  As a holiday  To celebrate the harvest  And the bringing of food  Into the heart  And the changing of the seasons  As it is  So what the hell  Is their point  I would love  I would love to know  If it's a Muslim group  Or if it's 
[01:13:00]  I would love to know  What kind of group  I'm always assuming  It's a Muslim group  Because they tend to be  Not the most fun  Well let's try to find more info  Not the most tolerant people  No they complain about  Intolerance  To Islam  And fine  You can complain about that  But boy when it comes to  Assimilating to American culture  I want to wear  What I want to wear  Regardless of the dress code  And I want school policy changed  To accommodate my kid  Because I won't raise him  In an American culture  How about when you  Get a driver's license photo  You have to show your face  And not wasting money 
[01:13:30]  Going to court  To try to have your picture taken  With that god damn  A burka  A burka over your head  With little slits  For eyeballs  What Pat  They shouldn't have a problem  Wearing a Halloween mask  If they don't have a problem  Wearing a burka  I'm punching out  Thanks Pat  Smokezilla writes  Here's an idea  If you don't like it  Stay the F home  Take the day off  Let's draw a funny face  On the burka  Let's go to Paul in Jersey  That woman's smiling  No one will recognize you  Paul what's up  Hey guys how you doing 
[01:14:00]  Good man  Hey what's up with the weathermen  Are they not allowed to say  Indian summer anymore  I mean this used to be  Indian summer every year  Now you don't hear it anymore  This whole politically correct thing  Is like crazy  No probably not  They have probably been told  By their supervisors  Not to use that one anymore  What's wrong with saying  Indian summer  I don't even know  What an Indian summer is actually  It just means all of a sudden  It's summer when it's fall  Okay  Yeah fall  You get the last  Of really warm weather  When summer is past  I like it because  It makes the  Winter seem shorter 
[01:14:30]  Because it's  You're getting slaughtered  By the Indians  That's okay  Alright let's say hi to Brian  Yeah good point  Brian Long Island  What's up  Hey what's up guys  I work for a textbook company  And we're not  I make school books  For grade schools  And we're not even allowed  To say the word  Halloween anymore  Are you kidding  We have to call it  Harvest time  Are you kidding me  The American education system  Just sucks  The priorities  We won't be able to sell 
[01:15:00]  In the south  If we mention Halloween  Because  My kid is not going  To regular school  Why can't they sell  In the south  Because these religious idiots  These hardcore Christians  Are Catholics  Yeah they say  They say it promotes witchcraft  When you start talking  About Halloween  In textbooks and stuff  Because you talk about  Witches and stuff like that  Yeah that's what happened  To every child  That celebrated Halloween  By putting on costumes  And going out trick or treating  They all turned into  Satan worshippers  And murdered their parents  Are these the same douches  That run around  Holding snakes  And talking in 
[01:15:30]  Babel  I speak in tongues  I had to do it on holidays  And I couldn't mention  Halloween or Christmas  Or anything  I had to pick all like  Non-religious  Regular holidays  And you know  Not being able to mention  Halloween or Christmas  Or anything  Really makes it  Limited for kids  I hear they're changing  Indian summer  To  Summer  Is that true  Let's go to Sarah  Is this going to be called  Summer  Sarah on Long Island  What's up  Hi good morning guys  Hey  Hi 
[01:16:00]  Alright  I don't celebrate  Halloween  At all  I'm a born again Christian  And the guy before me  When he was talking about  How it was  In Ireland  Yeah  Well  They did celebrate  The death of people  But then they also  Celebrated the fact that  The people who died  The previous year  Were then going to  Come up and  Possess  Wanted to living now  That's why  So why  It bothers you why 
[01:16:30]  Religiously it bothers you  Yeah  That's good  I don't care what  Everybody else does  Alright well that's the point  Alright as long as  You don't give a crap  That other people  Are celebrating  That's all well and good  Do you have  Do you have children  No I don't  Oh okay good  So you won't  Taint them with your  Ridiculous thinking  That's okay  Well I don't even mind that  As long as she doesn't  Try to infringe  What she does at home  With the rest of us  Like if you believe that  Fine  Don't let your kids  Celebrate Halloween  Be a fun mom  And if you're against it  Then keep the kid home  That day  Have him just sit there 
[01:17:00]  He won't even know  What he's missing  He'll think wow  I get to stay home  From school today  Cool  I'll watch cartoons all day  He'll know  When he sees kids  Laughing with candy bags  And wondering why mom  Is sitting there  Lecturing him  About the beauty of Christ  While he just wants  To go out and have fun  I'm not knocking  A born again Christian  Good for you  You screwed up  You fixed it  Yeah Sarah  What made you change  What made you go born again  What was your bottom  I love that second chance thing  It's great  What was your bottom  I used to do a lot of bad things  And  What  I walked into a Pentecostal church 
[01:17:30]  One day  Hold on hold on  You know we're doing a radio show  Yeah  We're doing a lot of bad things  It's not going to help us  Or anybody listening  What kind of bad things  Did you do  No one really knows you  No one really knows you Sarah  Come on  No one really  Okay  I did plenty of drugs  Okay  I was having plenty of premarital relations  Uh huh  Wait wait wait  That's pretty normal for a lot of people out there  What kind  Like really kinky stuff  Um listen 
[01:18:00]  Just a lot of stuff  Two  I didn't  You know I wasn't good  And then I walked into church  Two guys at once  What'd you say  Two guys at once  Yeah  Yeah you were doing stuff like that  Yeah  So basically you were fun  You were a fun fun girl  You'd do some drugs  Put you on the rotisserie  Nice  You were a good egg  Yeah  And then um  Jesus ruined all that  By uh getting into your life  Yes he did  He got into my heart  How did that happen 
[01:18:30]  That's the beauty of born again Christians man  You could do all this crazy stuff  You just walk into a church and  Ah born again  Then you just go like this  Yep  Wash my hands of all this  I'm all new  No uh  It's not an overnight thing  Except for a stretched out pussy  It's not something that just  It just happens  You didn't walk in  And have some revelation  You know what  He came over time  He definitely grew on me  But now I'm addicted 
[01:19:00]  So  Are you with a guy now  Pardon me  Are you with a guy now  Yeah  Jesus  He's a born again  Yeah  Okay  Honestly good for you  I just think  It's kind of silly  You know  You know what  And I already thought about  The Halloween thing  With raising kids  And my whole thought was that  I will have my kid  I'll take him out of school  For that day  And we'll go  You know  And hang out  Go to a game  Go to you know  Something else  And get his mind off  For the whole Halloween  But miss  Don't you understand  Like this is  Why don't you just 
[01:19:30]  Allow the kid to celebrate  In the spirit  That the other kids  Are celebrating  No one  Is looking at it  Like the dead  Possessing the  It's just a ghoulish  Silly reason  For kids to carry around  A pumpkin thing  And get candy  Yeah the holidays  In this country  If you took a poll  I would say  Most people  That celebrate Halloween  Celebrate Easter  They don't even  Acknowledge the religious angle  In these holidays  No  It's become something else  People now 
[01:20:00]  Are so stupid  And I just take  The superficial portion  Of the fuzzy little bunny  Or you know  The kids walking around  With candy  And by all means  When he's little  You know  Six, seven  I think at eight  It should stop  You know  With the dressing up  Like Buzz Lightyear  Or whatever  They're dressing up now  And then  At around nine or ten  Then come to the understanding  Of what the Halloween  Really represents  That's fine  But why  Again  Who cares if it's  Commercialized and fun  Why not 
[01:20:30]  It's fun  Christmas is fun  Easter is fun  Thanksgiving is fun  No one's thinking  Of the slaughter of the Indians  When we eat turkey  I do  Well yeah  I like that part of it  It's fun  Gave us a lot of good real estate  That's right  We all put anthrax blankets on  Have a few naps  Have a few giggles  Alright Sarah  Thank you  Thank you guys  Have a good day  Bye Sarah  I put one hand up  And go  Ugh  Me like  Heap'em turkey  You know 
[01:21:00]  Cause I like speaking Indian  Me and my family  Just watch F Troop  And laugh  Yeah  The Hakawi Indians  Cause they got there  And they were like  Where the heck are we  That's  That's  Is that really  That's their story  Wow  It wasn't originally  The Hakawi Indians  It started with an F  And that was their  Their name  Because when they  Arrived somewhere  They went  Where the  They asked who they were  And they didn't know  Where they were  And they said  Where the  Are we 
[01:21:30]  Thank you  A little history for you  Wow  Let's go to Pete in Jersey  What's up buddy  Hey man  Hey  I just  I think this whole  Halloween thing  Is just retarded  Yeah  Parents should  Concentrate on the fact  That they need to  Teach their kids  About strangers  And the rear dangers  In life  And not getting hurt  Let the kids  Have fun at Halloween  The worst things  That ever happen  For my kid  Is they get tummy aches  Alright there you go  Tummy aches  I'm distracted  Cause Tim in Pennsylvania  Are a little mad  Tim what's up  I just  I'm a born again Christian 
[01:22:00]  As well  I've been listening  To you guys  For a long time  And you guys  Are hilarious  But  But today we got to you  Right  This is the beauty  Of this show  People love us  Until like  We hit too close to home  Hit their thing  Right  You can say  You can say  What you want buddy  But I mean  You guys talk like  You have this  Sort of superior  Belief system  And that you know  We're ridiculous  We don't know  You know  We're silly  What is that all about  Tim can I say one thing  It's not that we think  We're better than  Born again Christians  Whatever cleans your life up  Whatever makes you feel good  Fine  But we don't try to impose 
[01:22:30]  Our thinking  And it tends to be  More religious people  Tend to try to impose  Their thinking on other people  And that's what the problem is  Yeah I don't think  My beliefs are superior  To yours there Tim  I just  You know  We point out observations  I love the born again Christian thing  That you can like  Have like the craziest life  You can be a sloppy party bottom  And do whatever the hell you want  And then you walk into a church  And you just go like this  Start over  And you get to start over  I think that's an amazing concept  Oh yeah  See there you go again  That's not me  I don't know  Maybe 
[01:23:00]  Tim  Tim  And we're also joking a little bit  You know  I don't  I don't find what I believe  Superior to what you believe at all  What happened  What happened  Jimmy said it best  If it works for you  Great  Yeah  Honestly in my life  I don't think that would work for me  I'd still probably have some guilt  And go  Wait a minute  All I had to do  Was walk in and out of this church  Or find Jesus  And I'm good  I think I'd still be haunted  By some of the stuff  I did in my past  That's all  Tim what happened  I'm praying for you guys  Okay  What drove you to  Become born again  I grew up in that kind of household 
[01:23:30]  And I made the decision  You know  When I was a teen  And I had screwed around a lot  But I was no drug addict  I didn't really get into  A lot of trouble  No you didn't bottom out somewhere  Yeah you just figured  Meh  I'll be born again  It made sense to me  It made sense  And when I did become born again  I definitely  You know  My life changed  And I'd see things  Through a different  Kind of a filter  Are you married?  Yeah man  I got kids  And we even go out for Halloween  But you know  It's like a different  Level of consciousness 
[01:24:00]  I suppose  That you know  I see  I kind of  I don't know  I operate on a different  You know  You think things  Things through spiritually  Hey Tim  I'm not saying  Tim let me ask you a question  This is what bugs me  It's not that you're born again  And your kids are good for you  But why is it that  Like if you like the radio show  And you know we tease everything  And we're idiots  And that's what we do  Why is it only like  When it's a subject  That is involved with  A person personally  That bothers them  Like why are you praying for us now  But not when we make fun of Islam  Or we make fun of murder 
[01:24:30]  Like you know that we hit everything  Just like the morons we are  So why would that  All of a sudden bother you  Because it's your thing  That's human nature  I just hear myself on the radio  Alright punch it out  Alright thanks Tim  I think it's just human nature  Yeah I think so too  But someone hits close  To what you believe  And then that's when  You finally get offended  Let's go to Scott in Teaneck  What's up  Hey guys  How you doing  Hey  Listen I'm a teacher  And we were told  At the beginning of the year  Not to celebrate Halloween 
[01:25:00]  Not to celebrate  Any of the holidays  Not to celebrate  Because it will offend  Muslim groups  It will offend Christian groups  It will offend all groups  Yuck  And also  There was a  There's a huge poster  Of a witch  And someone had to take it down  Because it offended  Someone at school  Of course  People are too offended  These days  No one is the courage  To go look  I'm sorry you feel that way  Yeah it's like  You know 
[01:25:30]  I've been doing this for years  Sorry  I mean we're getting  Over the top  Of this political correctness  Dude there's no line  Between somebody  Who's saying  Something genuinely  Vicious and awful  Where you have to take it down  And somebody who's just  Being hypersensitive  Hypersensitive people  Not just dealt with  The way you should  Which is to go  I'm sorry you feel that way  Yeah  Shut up  Move on  I'm sorry  This political correctness  Is all around us  I'm just waiting for people  To be fed up  And start the pushback  Because it's a tiny minority  In these instances 
[01:26:00]  That are just pushing around  The majority of the people  And they got them running  Scared for some reason  I don't get it  Yeah we need the pushback  It will happen too  I have faith in the pushback  We'll get fed up eventually  And then the pendulum  Will start swinging  The other way  Pendulum  Let's go to Peter  Peter what's up buddy  Hi  Hi  This is Peter  And I  I'm gonna be a werewolf  For Halloween  I am the werewolf  I am the werewolf

[01:34:30]  Sign up for Dish Network today  They're making fun of you on Instant Feedback  Because you're not there to defend yourself  That's quite alright  I don't mind  I'll get them back  Yeah  Or tonight  Alright  Oh, we got the Hitler CD now?  How do you get the full  No, we don't  That's just the track list  Oh, we got the track list  Of what?  The Hitler CD?  Yeah  Apparently there's been some kind of 
[01:35:00]  Hate mailings going around  Alright, hold on  In my neighborhood  Hold that thought  We got Richard Hough  Standing by  He only has a few minutes here  Richard Hough  Hey there  Is this the Dream Makers?  Yes  What's going on, Richard?  How are you guys?  Good, good  Saw your column in the paper this morning  Very interesting  Very insightful  We agree with a lot of what you say in this thing  The news is just 
[01:35:30]  It's insane now  It's not the news anymore  Well, obviously this piece is dealing with the promos  Which are promoting the people on the news  I mean, I'm talking about this Good Day New York  Dancing spot  Which, you know, sadly has the anchors trying to dance  But does nothing to get you to watch the show  Is there a reason that anchors  And whether people should be dancing  And that should be what gets you to go  These are the people I want to watch to inform me  Well, see, that's the thing 
[01:36:00]  In the mornings, they tend to be a little looser  And that's where, you know, you could get away with this  I couldn't imagine, say, Chuck Scarborough and Sue Simmons  Doing something like this  Although, let's not forget  They do the singing things  I could imagine Sue Simmons and Roz Abrams doing it, though  Yes  What happened to the morning news  Where it all of a sudden has this  It's a goofy show  It's not even news 
[01:36:30]  It's newsertainment  They dance  On the CW11 News  Which we call Jill TV  Because of Jill Nicolini  The lovely traffic girl  With a big bosom  Yeah, she's got big bosoms  She does something called Dance Friday  That's right  And they just start dancing  And everyone's laughing  And I'm sitting there going  Isn't there a war going on  Where people are being killed?  Well, yes  You're absolutely right 
[01:37:00]  And it's funny you mention that  Because it is odd  Every once in a while  When a show like that goes to real news  You know, when there is some breaking news  Because they're mixing that stuff in  Well, we pointed out  During the 9-11 anniversary  All the news stations  That are usually wacky and kooky in the morning  Like CW11  When they have an animal story  They play the  A little sound effect  And they have sound effect drops  That they throw in  But then on 9-11  For that one day  They had their somber versions 
[01:37:30]  Of their theme songs  Which are usually fun  And it was just this somber version  They all wore black suits and ties  No cleavage  Yeah, no cleavage was showing  No dancing  Yeah, they were just very subdued  No squirrels  No squirrels  Water skiing  Next day skateboarding  Dogs again  And all back to fun  And bikini car washes  Well, the thing is  With those shows  Is they've got so many hours  To fill it 
[01:38:00]  They would argue  Look, we give you some news  In the beginning  And then we have the rest  Of this entertainment stuff  There's no doubt  They're trying to keep people longer  I can give them that  But you're right  There does seem to be  A lot of entertainment  Mixed in with  It just  I think it completely  Tears away  Any credibility  They have  When they do try to report  On serious news  And they give you  No details  I think they're seeing  Things like YouTube  And other media  That is so quick hitting  And how people's attention 
[01:38:30]  Is very short these days  And they tell a story  And it leaves me  Sometimes going  Well, what happened?  Who was this one?  Or why did this person do this?  Or there's some more  Questions than answers  On the news  And I find myself  Going to the internet  To try to find out  More about a story  Well, I mean  That's a challenge  Everybody's facing  In this media world now  I mean, how many times  Does somebody say  Hey, look  Did you see this YouTube video?  And that then becomes  Our new campfire  That everybody's talking about 
[01:39:00]  So everybody  Is struggling with that  We're struggling with it  You're struggling with it  You know, how do you  Keep people into this stuff?  And it gets a little crazy  Sometimes  No doubt about it  And I find the same thing  There's nothing worse  When somebody says  For more about this  Go to our website  Well, you know  If we needed more  Why didn't you tell us now?  Yeah, just give me the information  Well, they don't have time  To tell you more  I actually  I think it's promising  That finally TV's  Embracing the internet  Because they just ignored  That internet thing  Like, oh, it's a fad  It's going to go away  But finally 
[01:39:30]  They're at least embracing it  Well, you know  That is a good point there  I think last week  Oh, thanks  For example  The Today Show  Had like a record  You know  14 million page hits  Yeah  And I think people  Are starting to look at that now  Is that extra audience  That we weren't figuring out before  Right  They go to pornography  Or something  Well, you know  I think it's an interesting trend too  Because TMZ  Obviously a huge website  On the internet  Is now a TV show  Absolutely 
[01:40:00]  And I said  Finally  They're getting it  Because there's so many people  Going to the internet  For their entertainment  They can't be bothered  With a lot of the crap  That's on TV  And finally  Someone realized that  And said  Wait  Why don't we take  One of these  Really hot websites  And turn it into a TV show  And then what TMZ  Gets to do  Is that  What you were just saying  Like if you need more info  On the Britney Spears thing  Or you want to see  The long version  Of the Britney Spears video  Go to our website  They're like  At least working together finally  Well, but that's  An interesting challenge here  Do you like the TV show?  It's alright 
[01:40:30]  See?  I mean, that's the point  The website works really well  Because it's like  You know  15 second clips  Of somebody getting  Trounced outside of a club  Right  I'm not so sure  It works that well on TV  I'm watching it every day  You know  I think there's  Some humor involved  In how they're presenting it  And they're not trying  To make believe  They're like  Entertainment tonight  Like they're like  High brow  And they're just giving you  The entertainment stories  They're basically going  Look, I'm with you  I want to see Britney Spears  Puking in an alley  And we think it's hilarious  And here's the video  I like that  From TMZ 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, and that's the nice thing  About that  They do that with a wink  And you're absolutely right  They're not saying  You know  Now on Entertainment Tonight  Here's the biggest  Greatest  Yeah, well  When they do the Britney Spears  Stuff on Entertainment Tonight  With Mary Hart and all that  It's like  They start with a little  Dramatic music  And they look at you  Like  Oh God  Look at this  She's a mother  Britney in trouble again  She's a mother  But they're showing it  Just like TMZ  Showing it  Because they know  It's great for their ratings  Yeah, I mean  TMZ as a web phenomenon  Is a huge success  I mean anybody  Who's in the media  Gets the emails 
[01:41:30]  Constantly  Of the latest video  And the latest updates  It's amazing  Where their cameras end up  You know what  Did translate very well  I think  From one medium to another  The cavemen  From the commercial  To network television  Because  Richard  Did you watch  The caveman show?  Well  I saw the pilot  I did not see  The one they aired  Oh you didn't see  The one they aired?  Did you like  The one they aired?  I laughed  Until my sides hurt  Because it was so good 
[01:42:00]  Oh it was  It was wonderful  To see the cave  If I could say this  Without laughing  To see the cavemen  Involved in like  Situations you and I  Would be in  I mean it's just  It was incomprehensibly good  Well I'll tell you  You know  I saw the pilot  Which I thought  Was horrifically bad  And showed it to  Some other folks  Who felt the same way  I  It just wasn't funny  Now the pilot  Is going to air this season  So I mean  They're not scrapping  The pilot 
[01:42:30]  It's just going to be  Like episode 3 or 4  Well that episode  They showed  The first episode  The premiere episode  They showed  This past week  Unbelievably boring  Just bad  The whole goof was  Look they're in  Caveman makeup  Yet they're acting  Sophisticated  Yet whatever they were saying  There was no humor to it  No jokes  No irony  Like there was nothing  There  They would go to commercial  And I'd sit there  And actually have to think  Is this a commercial now 
[01:43:00]  Or is it still part of the show  Yeah that show  Especially you know  The pilot  And even in the promos  It's some of the worst makeup  I've ever seen in television  It's just  It's hard not to look at these guys  And say  Well they're just guys in makeup  Second to Shaka  From Land of the Lost  What you're looking for  Is Alf  I mean  Yeah  You know  At least it's a puppet  You realize it's not real  These guys are trying to be real  And you know  The other thing  The thing about Caveman  And you guys are in the business here 
[01:43:30]  Is the amazing thing  Is that it got on the air  Yeah  And that you know  These things don't happen in a vacuum  It's not like you guys  Hatch it in the back room  And put it on the air today  This takes time  Yeah  This takes meetings  And has to run past people  Yeah  Exactly  And it gets on the air  Well we're a little close  Too close to that  Because Jim Norton  In studio here  He was on Lucky Louie  On HBO  And Lucky Louie  Was way better  Than Caveman will ever be  We got trash  We got trashed  By a lot of critics  Which was fine  I mean it's gonna happen  But it wasn't the fact 
[01:44:00]  That I minded them  Not liking the show  It was when they went  After content  And language  And the set  When they went after  Things like that  And yet they seem  To reward  Things like overly done sets  And you know  I just  I had a real hard time  With it  Yeah  Hey Richard  What do you cover  You cover the local news  And what else  TV in general  Everything on TV  Oh that's cool  We should have you on more  You had a great point  By the way  I have to say this  In your column  A really great thing  You said  Talking about that  Good day roll  You said it's cute  It's snappy  It actually makes 
[01:44:30]  Some colleagues chuckle  That in a nutshell  Is exactly this  Self-congratulating  Smug attitude  The news has had  This wink at myself  Because I'm behaving  Cutely on the air  And it's revolting  And it's not cute  And it's not engaging  And it's not intriguing  It's not interesting  Certainly not informative  Like they're supposed to be  You really  That's exactly what it is  It's cute to some colleagues  And another point  In your column  They hired a new anchor  At one of the stations  Just trying to make it  Make sense for the rest of America 
[01:45:00]  This is where everyone can relate  The new anchor  This woman  She already is making a mark  Richard Huff writes  This week  While reading a report  About Beyonce  Canceling a concert  She said this  Her peeps say  It's a scheduling conflict  Yeah  Peeps  Yeah  We're now downgrading  Downgrading the language  To try to get younger viewers in  Yeah  And try to be hip  You know look  Do people use that  On the street?  Absolutely 
[01:45:30]  But you know  As you guys have pointed out  In this entire conversation  You're expecting a little bit more  From your newscast  I couldn't  Could you ever imagine  Like  And now  With the end  Of the tech offensive  All of my peeps  Are saying  The war in Vietnam  Is unwinnable  Peeps  Yeah  That would be good  And by the way  I don't expect anything  From the local news anymore  Well  You know  They're there  They're still a  A major factor  In where people  Get their information  Especially locally  But 
[01:46:00]  That's amazing  It is getting cheesier  And sometimes dumber  As they attempt  To compete with everything else  And they're trying to compete  With each other so much  That they're trying to  Outdo each other  With the dancing  And the wackiness  And who is the  Who is the guy  That they send out  Every morning  To do some wacky  Ridiculous stunt  Oh Larry  Yeah  Larry Hoff  Over on  Larry Hoff  Yeah  He is just  I cannot watch it  When he  When I see him like  Oh good  He's parachuting today  Please have a catastrophic 
[01:46:30]  Failure  Of your equipment  I really just want  To see him plummet  He's a frat guy  That never grew up man  Yeah  Well you know  He's going to do  All the crazy stuff  No he's extreme  Extreme  Oh Larry  That's crazy  I can't believe  You're doing that  Yeah imagine being  A great adventurer  At you know  Six o'clock in the morning  I mean that's  Yeah wow  That's what he does  That's his gig  He must be proud  Of his career  Huh  Well you know  He's probably done it  Ten in the morning  So  Yeah  Who's laughing  It probably is the fact  That the news  This is why  I don't even mind 
[01:47:00]  The news doing this  But just be honest  About what you are  It's that they're given  This special preference  When it comes to content  And when it comes to  Things like that  That other shows  Are not given  The news is like  Allowed to go so much farther  With what they show  And what they talk about  Because they're news  Because they're news  But in reality  They're becoming more  Entertainment than news  The news is like  A backdrop  To them  Showing snappy graphics  And sound bites  And getting talking  Heads on there  It's not about  I can't watch a newscast 
[01:47:30]  In the morning  And really be informed  About what's going on  In my area  Well I think  You know  To that point  You've got to watch  The very beginning  Of the shows  Where you're going to  Get your news break  The rest of it  Is filler  Is filler  But they glaze over  All those stories  Like I don't know  There's so much information  I don't know  After I hear a story  I hear it  It piques my interest  I go wow  That's you know  Maybe something  That's happening  In my neighborhood  And I sit there  And go  They didn't tell me 
[01:48:00]  Like kind of  A little insight  On to why this happened  Who was involved  Suspects  What the police  Are saying about it  Like there's none  Of this detail  They just say  There was a murder  Here  And police are  Looking into it  Next up  We got  Did you actually  Expect that though  I would like  A little more information  I watched the news  And realized  Just about all of this  Is just nonsense  They just showed  Complete nonsense  The Good Day  Roll commercial  Where they're all dancing 
[01:48:30]  Yep  And it's like  It's this phony joy  And this fake  Plastic  Everything's alright  Attitude  It's just drivel  It's drivel  As then they tell the news  And talk about murders  And rapes  And child abductions  Hey Richard  What's your favorite  Show on TV right now  You know I like  A show on NBC  Called Life  Life  Life  It stars Damien Lewis  Oh yeah  He's great man  And Sarah Sahi  Who's one of my favorites  Is his partner  On that show  It's a quirky show 
[01:49:00]  I don't know  If it's going to make it  Just because of  Time period  Up against  Dirty sexy money  But you know  It's a fun show  About a guy  Who was a cop  Who was wrongly convicted  Gets out of jail  Wins 11 million bucks  I think  In a settlement  And he goes back to work  So he's got a lot of quirks  And he's out to get  The folks who  Who got him  Oh yeah I heard about that show  Hey what do you think  About that show  That the guy  That was in  In Rome  He's in  And he does a little  Time travel thing  Journeyman  Yeah  Journeyman  Yeah  Kevin McKidd  You know that show's  Not so bad  It's just a little hard 
[01:49:30]  To figure out  When they're flipping  Back and forth  Isn't that Quantum Leap though  Yeah I was saying  That's kind of Quantum Leap-ish  But  Exactly  Quantum Leap was great  By the way  I loved that show  Growing up  The problem is  Unless he goes back  So far that  They're wearing Roman costumes  It's sometimes hard  To figure out  Whether it's  1980 or 1990  Okay  That's a little difficult  But I think  It's an interesting concept  He's an interesting actor  Yeah  I don't hate it  But I don't know 
[01:50:00]  It's going to work either  Do you dig  The reality show still  Or  Oh yeah  I love reality shows  I thought  The Nashville  On Fox  Was a pretty good show  Which is  Getting pulled anyway  About  It's a Laguna Beach  Set in Nashville  Okay  Which is pretty cool  And I'll watch  Virtually anything  You like the hot babes  In those reality shows  I will not deny that  You watch Kid Nation  Or Biggest Loser  Or  You know  Biggest Loser 
[01:50:30]  Is a fun show  I love Biggest Loser  It's a fun show  And you don't feel bad  About yourself in the end  Kid Nation  I was a little disappointed in  Yeah  You know  Just the hype aside  And I realized  That was  A publicity machine  Working  Yeah  Yeah  But when we actually  Saw the show  It wasn't so good  I wanted it to be better  And a good example  That  I have an 8 year old daughter  Who watches it every week  And told me that  A bunch of her friends  Say it's a stupid show  Wow  So if you're losing  The kids 
[01:51:00]  Who are  Supposed to be part of it  It's not working  Cast is just way too big  Yeah  The cast is way too big  In Kid Nation  I was hoping for  Just a little more  Of that Lord of the Flies  Mentality in that show  I'm not saying  Let's sacrifice a kid  Or anything  But it's so controlled  And you can tell  There's a lot of adults around  I think CBS  Threw all that out there  That these kids  Were working in horrible conditions  And where's the outrage  Yeah  The publicity  I think they started 
[01:51:30]  That whole thing  Because it's so obvious  There's cameramen  And all sorts of people  Around  These kids are not unsupervised  Well look  You know  CBS played us all  Masterfully  With the launch of Survivor  You know  When Survivor came out  We were all talking about  16 people being dropped  On an island  And everybody seemed to forget  There are camera crews  And medical crews  Because we wanted to believe  There were 16 people  On an island  Living by themselves  Eating rats  Which they did  But you forget about  All these other people around  They're not going to send 
[01:52:00]  These kids out there  On their own  It's just not going to happen  Yeah  With this authentic element  Of danger  You know  It's this perceived  Element of danger  Well I mean look  There's no such thing  As real reality  It's just  You know  Cops is about as close  As you're going to get to that  Yeah  The rest of this stuff  Is sort of contrived  It doesn't make it bad  But for anybody  To sit here and think  These kids are out there  By themselves  Is ridiculous  Yeah  And CBS  Having lived through  The Survivor start  Figured that  If we don't say anything  Or if we just let 
[01:52:30]  This stuff sort of  Trickle out  We're going to build  Attention for the first night  Which they did a little bit  But ultimately when folks  Saw the show  Realized it wasn't that good  Yeah I kind of gave up  On it already  And I was  I watched the first episode  I was kind of into it  Then by the second one  I'm like alright  Nothing else to see here  Time to move on  Well the problem is  There are just too many people  There are too many kids  And folks have described it  As a loss  Where you get a couple  That emerge each week  But you know  It's not like Survivor  Which is a granddaddy  In this stuff  Where you know  By four weeks in  You've got a core group 
[01:53:00]  Of people you're following  And drawn to  Yeah  I love Biggest Loser  Especially when  All the fatties get together  And they have to vote off  One fatty from their team  Because you know  They're not good enough  To lose the weight  I'm sorry  You lost only eight pounds  Instead of twelve  Right  What's funny about that Joe  It's amazing  It's amazing to me  That even fat people  Think like everyone else  Of course they do  We're all humans  Right  They're all fat  But they're sitting around  Going wow 
[01:53:30]  Yeah we know we're all fat  But you're really  You're the fatty in this group  We know you have no self control  And you're not going to be able  To lose the weight  So get out of here  Well what's always funny  About that Joe too  Is how they make  You know the women  Stand there with those sports tops  Oh good god yeah  And the men take off  Their shirt for the weigh-ins  It's like come on  You know  It's the only humiliating  Part of the whole show  Otherwise  You know it's a fun show  They do a great job  But if there's a guy  On this season's  Biggest loser  A black guy  Not that that matters  I guess  But when he takes his shirt off 
[01:54:00]  I'm amazed that they're not  Cubing out his breasts  Oh really  They look  If you didn't see  If you would just focus  On that area  You would  You would be convinced  It's a woman  That's how bad  This guy's chest is  And I'm like  Wow they're letting that  Go on TV  Because there's times  They will  Cube that stuff out  If the guy has  Man boobs  Yeah no  It's a fun show  It's a good one  What do you think  Of a show like  You brought it up  Lost  Yeah that's one of those  Shows that I've never  Gotten into  Really  Yeah there are some 
[01:54:30]  Die hard fans  Who  Oh I got  I got addicted  Yeah  It's just not one  That I've  Fell in love with  I got addicted  To that  What about Heroes  Are you into  Any of those  Same deal  I'm not a big  Sci-fi fan  Which is why  I was surprised  I actually liked  Journeyman  In that sense  Again I appreciate  The quality of the show  It's just  It's not something  I watch  And quickly  The Ken Burns  Documentary War  You know  I was a little  Disappointed in that one  Yeah  I watched 
[01:55:00]  Most of it  And I wasn't  Quite as moved  As I was  For things like  The Civil War  Yeah the Civil War  I could see  At some points  He's trying to get  That same feel  With the music  And the still  Black and white  Pictures and stuff  But I  I just love that  Anyway  I love any of the  Documentaries  And I think  It's a good job  That he did  Trying to  Relate it to  The four separate  Towns  Instead of just  Another World War  II documentary  So I kind of 
[01:55:30]  Like it  Yeah no  I liked it  I just didn't  Think it was  As great as  I thought it  Was going to be  Based on all  The reviews  I had read  Very hard to  Compete with that  Civil War one though  Because that was  Just brilliant  Well I think  It's one of those  Things where Ken  Burns sort of  Ruined it for himself  He came out  With the Civil War  And did just  A fabulous job  And then everybody  Else who does  Those kinds of  Projects  Step up their game  So I mean  If you care about  The Civil War  You can turn on  The Military Channel  On any night  And find some  Sliver of the war 
[01:56:00]  In detail  So there wasn't  A lot that  Sort of  You know I learned  A little  I was entertained  A little  But at the end  Of it I wasn't  Like this is  The greatest  Thing I've ever  Seen  I'm more of  A fan of  LA Inc  Instead of  The Ken Burns  Thing  You know I like  That show too  Me and my girl  We watched an  LA Inc  Marathon  I couldn't get  Enough of it  Just people  Getting tattoos  In LA  I'm amazing  Richard Huff  Is into  Junk TV  He has  Geez are you  Into garbage  Television  I love 
[01:56:30]  Junk TV  And the thing  Is you know  With LA Inc  I can't get  Around that  Woman with  The pierced  Cheeks  Yeah  Well did you  See the watch  Thing she wears  No  She's into  Body modification  Whatever it's  Called  And she has  A lump  Around where  A watch  Would be  It's a circle  Yikes  Where the  Skin is raised  Oh yeah  She's doing  All sorts of  Craft to her  Body  I think she  Has a split  Tongue  And I'm  Just amazed  That people  Come in  With a picture  And then  I don't  Know by  The end  Of the episode  The picture  Looks  Looks  The same 
[01:57:00]  On their  Tattoo  Hey  You know  I talked  To folks  About that  And that  Show  That and  Miami Inc  You know  You can't  Watch that  Show without  Wanting a  Tattoo  I mean  They are  So good  Richard is  Absolutely right  I'm sitting  Around going  Man  I gotta get  One of these  Yeah  Yeah  Exactly  Because they're  Such good  Artists  I mean  They're very  Talented  Amazing  Artists  And you  Walk away  From that  And it's  Like damn  I should  Get one  And they're  Not too  Bad on the  Eyes  There right  Not at all  Not at all  Except that  Cheek thing

[02:04:00]  That someone's typing  This out the entire time  Alright hold on  One second  I've got to keep  A bit going  How's mother  I don't know  Maybe dead  Oh wow  That's today's answer  No I have no idea  Alright  By the way  Can I say  This is what Renee is  You're a beautiful  Simpleton  I bet you like  Fur smiling  I bet you like  Furious wheels too  Huh  What was that  Furious wheels  No  Not so much  No  Too confusing  She doesn't comprehend  Like how will I ever  Get back to earth  I'm only saying that 
[02:04:30]  Because you laughed out loud  Reading it  What the F  I haven't read it  It could be very good  Alright  You know how to follow  The what the F format  Right  Yeah  We added to it  A little bit  Just to like  Spice up  E-Rock's awful bit  So you end with  What the F as well  Right  Yeah  Start with  What the F  Is with people  Touching my pillow  If people come over  And they sit on my bed  And I have tons of pillows  On my bed  Which one do you think  That they will lay on  While watching a movie  Or whatever  My pillow  How the hell  Out of all these pillows 
[02:05:00]  Do they manage to pick  The one I sleep on  What the F  That made you laugh  I think that's funny  Because one  It's probably true  And two  That someone's  Going to sit here  And think about  All their little  Pet peeves in life  And write it down  I think that's hysterical  And three  It stinks  I think it's funny  And four  It's awful  And for  I have a few  Problems with it  Yeah  Maybe E-Rock  Could help me out  Because he's the author  Yes 
[02:05:30]  Of that one  Um  You have a lot of  Pillows on your bed  Do you  Um  I was living with  A female at the time  Alright okay  I understand  A lot of pillows  And you had a problem  With a female  Using your pillow  No  I had a problem  A lot of pillows  No here's what  I'm getting at  Who is sleeping  Or laying in your bed  Watching television  That you would have  A problem  If they used  Your pillow  It was a college dorm  Yeah okay  Regardless  And um 
[02:06:00]  So  It's pretty much  Like one big room  Your bed's there  The TV's on the desk  Right  So when they had  People over  They're sitting on your bed  They're sitting  Right on my pillow  I fucked in college dorms  I know  Excuse me  It's ten to nine  Anthony said  I've effed  In college dorms  Yes  I know  This week  I know what  I know what  A college dorm  Looks like  So a guy  Would come in  And just like  Lay on your bed 
[02:06:30]  And grab your pillow  Now you said  You were living  With a girl  In the dorm  Um  After your freshman year  They have like  College apartments  So you don't move  Off campus  But you have like  Um  A big room  A common room  A common room  Yeah that kind of thing  Uh huh  And um  All the bedrooms  Are adjoined around  The common room  So when you'd have  People over to watch  TV or a movie  Or something  They would sit  On the bed  But they would sit  Right on the pillow 
[02:07:00]  And that used to  Freak me out  What the eff  What the eff  What the eff  And that  You found funny  Well because  I'm also thinking  In the way  That he's reading it  It's also the  Delivery  And the whole thing  Which I thought  Was funny as well  So  But the thing is  When I read it  It's true  Because when people  Come over  And they sit  All over your pillows  And be like  Alright you have to  Sleep  Alright so  Would you buy  A what the eff book  From Iraq  No right  I mean just these  Kind of  The eff calendar  No 
[02:07:30]  We also  Asked her to bring  In something new  That she thinks  Is funny  And you brought  In the  The teacher  Freaking out  Yes  I'm  Because I remember  When I was in  High school  Middle school  Whatever  Anytime a teacher  Got mad  About anything  Someone pissed him  Off or whatever  He gets pissed  And you start laughing  Because it's  You never see  This side of a teacher  Before  I think it's  I think it's great  I think it's funny  Well I do remember 
[02:08:00]  A lot of people  Laughing at the teacher  When they would get mad  Of course  So this teacher  Freaks out  At the students  And it's  Self-explanatory  Alright let's  This is what  Renee thinks is funny  By the way  You're a sound  Not a sound  When an exercise  Will come on  You will stand  You will stand  Quietly  You will pay attention  Any questions  No sir  What's great  Is the other  Student's laughing  He's losing his mind 
[02:08:30]  No sir  Mr. Hand  This reminds me  Of the Boston father  Picking up his kid  Greatest  That is some  Of the best audio ever  And then  It goes on  Student starts to whistle  Teacher yells to stop  No whistle  Stand up  Stand up  Come on  Get off  I don't have to stand up  You don't have to stand  No I don't  No I don't  Are you kidding me 
[02:09:00]  Stand  Are you serious  I am damn well serious  Holy  Holy  Are you going to seriously  Take a sheriff  Underneath me  So more of the teacher  Losing his mind  Pretty much yeah  You know what sucks  About this stuff  Is that all the students  Know that the teacher  Can't touch him  So even the yelling  Doesn't mean crap  When we went to school  Teachers would  Would hit you  Oh of course 
[02:09:30]  Oh yeah  I have  I have seen videos  Of teachers  Slapping students  Right  But I wasn't sure  If that was  They had permission  That used to pull hair  And do whatever it took  To shut up kids  Oh yeah  And if your teacher  Hit you in school  When you got home  Your dad would hit you  Because you did something  That made the teacher  Hit you  Yeah but nowadays  If you are a teacher  And you hit a kid  The kid goes home  And now the parent  Runs up to school  And gets the teacher fired  Well you shouldn't be able  To hit a kid  Oh you should be able  To belt him  That was funny 
[02:10:00]  I will agree  That was a good one  Yeah  Although the E-Rock thing  You read  I've read funnier  Murder confessions  It's at the whole point  Of the delivery  And thinking of him  Reading it  And being annoyed  No matter how you phrase it  I don't care  If Jocko the Clown reads  While tap dancing  On fart machines  It stinks  It's always interesting  To find out  What you find funny  Renee  Well I got more coming  So  Oh boy we can't wait  Actually the teacher thing  Wasn't that bad  No that was fine  I liked that 
[02:10:30]  I wish we could do  More time on that  It's okay  It sparked a discussion  That we can't have now  Because we ran out of time  I can figure out  What she does on the weekends  For fun  I work on the weekends  This is my weekend  The space here  Is my weekend  You just work  I work doubles  Constantly  I work at a restaurant  And I work doubles  All day  What do you do  Waitressing  Or hostess  I'm a waitress  Waitress  You do alright  Depending on the day  Depending on the clientele  Depending on everything  Yeah  More cleavage  Yes  Better tips

[02:12:30]  Oh the cash hang  We got  Drew from  Fark.com outside  Yes  We got Rick Shapiro  Outside  And we have  Francine coming in  To  I don't know  Do whatever she does  Talk about her  Life  Her life  Sure  That's all she's gotta do  Want to start with  Drew  Talk about her baby killing  Drew  Hey where's Drew  Get off your dumb laptop  And come on in  And say hi  There he comes  This guy has to be  On a laptop  24 hours a day 
[02:13:00]  By the way  Poe confused you  For one of my cousins  For some reason  I just found out  Did you notice that  No I didn't catch it  Where's Poe  Poe  Poe is as  That's the Poe  Poe is as dumb  As they come  I was gonna say  You have cousins out there  As soon as I  As soon as I carry  Officially I'll tell  Him to his face  Poe  You thought this was  One of my cousins  Yes I did  And why  All you people  Look alike  There you go 
[02:13:30]  All you white guys  Why  Absolutely  He looks like you  A little bit  A tiny bit  I can tell by  The little look  That me and Drew  Just had  That we're both insulted  We had the same reaction  By that  Okay well  We're both insulted  By that  Yeah yeah we get it  Alright  Thanks guys  But you thought  He was one of my cousins  Yeah I thought  He was one of your cousins  And when he came in  I wanted to make sure  That he was comfortable  And I gave him 
[02:14:00]  His water or his coffee  And he didn't want anything  Got special treatment  Yeah it was great  I was kinda confused with it  He's a bottle of water  In here that is  Really funny  But I did get the message from Steve  To take good care of them  So I did  Excellent  Yeah he offered strippers  But didn't see it  Didn't pan out  No unfortunately  Well how's  How's thefark.com doing  Yeah doing great actually  I shouldn't call him thefark  It's fark.com  I like it  It's like the Batman  The Batman  Right  It's the Fark 
[02:14:30]  The Fark  You ever been to the Fark  Yeah well actually  The Fark is a terrorist organization  In Colombia  We're not related to them  Oh really  I would hope not  No  Yeah they actually  Their calling card by the way  Is they use  Instead of human bombs  Like they do in Iraq  They use donkey bombs  They strap dynamite to donkeys  And send them into marketplaces  And detonate them  That's a lot smarter  Wow  Same value as the ones in Iraq  Yeah exactly  Same value as a human  Over there sure  Wow  Yeah so  But that's not us  So  But a lot  A lot of new things  Happening over there  Yeah  At Fark  Fark TV 
[02:15:00]  Yeah we've been busy with that  Yeah  I've seen some of that stuff  That you put up there  Very funny  Yeah there's a bunch of good guys  Down there actually  It's a bunch of friends of mine  In Atlanta  That started putting it together  And we actually managed to get  Turner to buy the thing  So that  Because we don't have any money  So  Yeah  It's great  It's like good production value  Wait wait  But explain  Why does Fark TV  Why is that cool  It's like comedy  What they do is  They basically  Instead of like  Because people come  Talk to me all the time 
[02:15:30]  So you should do a TV show  And I'm like  Well yeah but what exactly  I'm actually trying to help you out  Because at this point  Saying that  You know  There's a video site on the web  Is like  What makes Fark TV cooler  Than the other sites  Is what I'm saying  Yeah  And the other stuff  That you can see out there  What we're doing is  Instead of having a guy  Behind the desk  Reading crap to you  Which is incredibly boring  What they do instead  Is they basically  They'll read Fark  They'll find a story they like  And then they'll reenact  Kind of a spoof on it  Not the actual story  But a little bit different  Like for example  We did one with a guy  That had a date with a porn star  For example  And he was in a wheelchair  So this didn't happen 
[02:16:00]  But the episode starts out  Where the guy  Somebody mugs the guy  At a bus stop  Because he told him  He has a date with a porn star  And sits down in the wheelchair  Instead and goes on the date for him  That kind of stuff  See there you go  There's a different angle  On the whole thing  Exactly yeah  Or like for example  One of the episodes we did  There was an article about how  And this was about a year ago  Some people tried to trade  A baby for a car  Right right  Yeah you may remember this  Because it was dumb  It was out in Colorado  And everybody got arrested  Which meant that  The guy who showed up  To trade the baby for the car  Was expecting a baby  As opposed to just 
[02:16:30]  You know  Oh $2,000 for the car  Oh well what about this small child  Will you take this small child  As payment  And what they did was  Is they did an entire car dealership  Based on you know  Just coming up  And paying with kids  Yeah  So  Yeah I got some funny stuff  On there man  And I'm noticing  You're  The people that  Join up and comment  Yes  On a lot of these  Boy are they getting  Rambunctious  Yeah but they are  They hate everything  It's great  They cannot stand  Everything 
[02:17:00]  That is posted  They don't like  The title  Of the post  No  They don't like  The material  They don't like  Whoever posts first  Will just be trashed  And flamed  For his opinion  And it always  It will not go  Five posts  Before no matter  What the subject matter  President Bush  Will get trashed  Exactly  And then Hitler  Gets mentioned  Yeah Hitler gets mentioned  It's just like Hitler  Are you talking about  Our website or  It's about the same  Just like no value  Every website  There's no value anymore 
[02:17:30]  To like trashing  Because everyone does it  It has to go  You have to trash  Every single thing  You see on the internet  It seems  Yeah pretty much  Everybody's cooler  Than everybody else  I guess  There used to be  A value to it  Where you saw  Someone trashed  And I'm like  Oh wow that's interesting  But now it's like  The cool thing  Is to just trash it  No matter if it's  Great or not  Well it's like  Give an example  The Fark TV stuff  For example  If you read the comments  In there  That's about as vicious  As they ever get  Oh yeah  But you look at it  And you compare  A number of comments  You'll have like  100 or 200 people  Will say oh I hate this  This sucks  And then 40,000 people  Will go check it out 
[02:18:00]  So you know  Keep the math  It's not that big a deal  That's why  You can't take  That crap seriously  No not at all  You just ignore it  It's no big deal  What is Fark  Talking about today  Oh we got all kinds  Of weird stuff  We got a  Apparently the bird flu  Has jumped into humans  So we should all  Go home and never  Leave the house  Yeah sure  I love that  Everybody panic  Everybody panic  It's one of those things  Where they've been  Trying to scare us  With this for a couple  Of years now  And it was  If it ever becomes  Airborne  That's when 
[02:18:30]  You know  The plague is starting  Yeah we're all screwed  So now they're saying  That that has passed  They say it actually  Has happened  Yeah but they  Don't have anybody  That's got it  They say it's mutated  Into something we can  Actually catch  But nobody's caught it  No one's caught it  What the hell is this  Does anyone  In this room at least  Or anybody  Know anyone that's  Gotten the bird flu  No nobody does  Nobody's ever caught it  That's the thing  It holds no  If I saw a bird  Sniffling and coughing  Into a hanky  I'd still fuck it  Yeah  The only people that  Have ever caught the bird flu  Live in third world countries  In the same house 
[02:19:00]  Where they have their chickens  They're shit all over the floor  And they're breathing in  Like dried shit dust  Yeah exactly  That's how you catch it  And then you go to the hospital  And they can't save you  Because it's a third world country  Yeah they don't know  Yeah they bring out the guy  With the stick  And they bleed you  For a little while  To see if they can fix it  Put some leeches on you  And that's not gonna kill human life  NASA's gonna do that  No exactly  The planet will be destroyed  And it'll be NASA's fault  Exactly  They're gonna allow  Some dumb space dust  To come in  And then fuck us all up  There you go  Yeah  No without a doubt  I mean well  I had a book come out recently 
[02:19:30]  Where I talk about this  It's all about media patterns  And one of the ones  Is fear mongering  And I actually mentioned  You guys in the book  I love fear mongering shit  Yeah well you remember  Culture of Fear  Was one of my favorite books  Oh it's fantastic  Yeah  One of the times  I was on the show  Actually coincidentally  We obviously didn't time  This was the morning  Katrina hit New Orleans  Yeah  Yeah and we sat here  And we were watching the TV  And we were just making fun  Of the news coverage  Or whatever  Because we were like  Oh come on  There's no way New Orleans  Is gonna be wiped off the map  By this  That can't possibly happen  Yeah  You know you point up  You bring up one of the only times  We were completely wrong 
[02:20:00]  Because I remember that show  Oh I was right there with you  We should replay that actually  Because now it's really uncomfortable  To hear we're like  Ah another hurricane  It's like a stupid  Fear mongering  Culture of fear  Nothing's gonna happen  Couple houses are gonna go down  Who gives a shit  And then it turned out  To be what it was  A big disaster  Yeah  We kind of like  Walked out of the scene  Backwards  What are we  Meteorologists  Yeah  What are we supposed to know  What I did was  Actually that morning  I compiled all of the articles  Being written about it  Because they knew  Landfall was gonna be that morning  So the media's ready  With their crap right  So I compiled the worst case scenario  Which was pretty close 
[02:20:30]  To what actually happened  But not exactly  Because what they said was  Is New Orleans will be underwater  They got that right  So everybody would be treed  Basically waiting for people  To come pick you up  And while you're in the tree  In the middle of the Mississippi river  While you're being flooded out  Coffins will be floating by  On fire  Because the refineries  Would have overflowed their banks  And somehow somebody  Would have thrown a match  Into the river  Right  And then there would be  Roving balls of fire ants  Roaming around  Because apparently  They can swim  Right the fire ants  Yes  Oh man I forgot about  The fire ants  There are actually articles  About watch out for the fire ants 
[02:21:00]  If you live in New Orleans  It's like  You got bigger problems  With fire ants  I remember an article  Where they said  Watch out for the sharks  They were going to swim in  That's right  Yeah  And all of it  With ants riding on top of them  Yeah  Breathing ants at you  It was horrible  But it was all about the flooding  It had nothing to do with  Like this peripheral crap  That they would bring up  Oh yeah  No exactly  And the book deals with  Stuff like that  Yeah  It talks about in fear mongering  How basically what happens  Is that they run out of  Actual stuff to talk about  Like if an actual event occurs  Like Katrina 
[02:21:30]  Okay obviously that's a big deal  But what happens is  Is that  So the next day  What do you talk about  Okay New Orleans is still screwed  That's not a good article  So what they do is  They run off on what they call  Sidebars  Which are basically tangents  My best example of that  Is that you'll see these articles  That appear every single year  Once in the summer  Once in the winter  Oh my god it's hot outside  In big 72 point font  On the front page  As if we didn't already know  And then in winter  You get oh my god  It's cold outside  And there will be 20 articles  About where to go  If you're too hot  And don't have an air conditioning  People fry eggs on sidewalks 
[02:22:00]  It's like it's the same crap  We see every year  Check on the elderly  Yeah check  It's like if you don't already know  How to get out of the heat  You should just die  Yeah  Just die  Get it over with  By the way  I said Nassau  Because you know  That's a Long Island county  Yeah  So someone from Nassau  Said it's Nassau  I was wondering  Why the Bahamas  That's such a problem  How are they going to kill us  Such a problem with earth  It's going to be space dust  You like the news teases  And all that stuff  Which ones are those  Oh we love the tease  When they come on 
[02:22:30]  Oh yeah yeah  Can this household object  Kill you  Yeah  Tune in at 11 to find out  It's like tell me now  Well you know  We haven't played in a while  We got our hall of fame  Of news teases  Oh fantastic  This is perfect  Because it's just like  Your book  Oh yeah  The fear mongering  One city wants to pack  All their sex offenders  Into a three block area  Problem is  It could be right next  To your house  There you go  Yeah  Ah  Run  I just imagine  A politician going  I want all the sex offenders  In my district 
[02:23:00]  That's right  And in a two block radius  It's fantastic  And then what happens  Like right after that  Two blocks  Where right across the street  It's like  Oh that's the sex offender area  Yeah well you know  In the town I live in  In Lexington, Kentucky  They passed a law  Where they actually  They extended the distance  Between where a sex offender  Can live near a school  It used to be  Within 200 feet  Now it's 1500 feet  I don't think people realize  That's a third of a mile  The entire city  Is six miles across  And there's 130 schools in it  Nobody can live anywhere 
[02:23:30]  They're like one alley somewhere  And then like the other counties  That's all you got  You got to be up in a balloon  In high air balloons  You got to be up  A third of a mile though  Because if you're any longer  You want to go out  For Starbucks  You got to get in your balloon  And just rise above  All the problem areas  Yeah well one of the problems  We have too is that  You can actually get on  The sex offender registry  For public urination  Which is really bad  Yeah yeah  Because I'm scared to death now  Because I mean you know  I've done it  Yeah who hasn't  Who hasn't  Fist after a concert  Or a ball game  Or getting decent exposure  And they could pop you for that 
[02:24:00]  Here's another one  How a twist on the predator law  Could shut down religion  Yeah I don't know  That's right  We're closing all the churches  How do they justify  Even saying something like that  Yeah that's a good question  Well you know what's funny  Is I talked to my buddy at CNN  Who gave me a great blurb  For the book  Who basically said  I'm absolutely on target  But he was telling me  That the news industry  Actually knows not to do that  In serious news  And he said in particular  On 9-11  One of the CNN affiliates 
[02:24:30]  Local affiliates  Went to commercial  And lost all the ratings  For the rest of the day  Nobody came back  Yeah  They all changed channel  Like screw it  When something actually  Is going on  They don't do this stuff  Yeah yeah  You've gotta  Keep hitting them  With the same story  Like you said  9-11  Yes  If the second  They went to a break  Yes  I was gone  Ratings just gone  I wanted to know  I wanted to know  What was going on  Yep  So it was either CNN  Or Fox  And if they  They didn't go to break  I know CNN  Just kept going  And going  And going  Yeah  Oh yeah 
[02:25:00]  Exactly  That's because  They all know  That the minute  They change it  You're gone  And so when they say  You know  Can this household object  Kill you  If it actually could  They're gonna  Go to a live commercial  Or a live break  And say hey  Everybody look out  There's bears in the streets  Stay inside  Here we go  The next one  Could frequent hiccups  Be a sign of cancer  Watch News 8 to 10  If you get hiccups  Now you're gonna be  Scared shit  And their tease  Is all about  Trying to bring in  As many people as possible  That could be affected  Who doesn't hiccup  At this  You know 
[02:25:30]  Exactly  Yeah  Well they do that  With the weather  For example  You notice  A lot of local news stations  Have told their reporters  You have to  Leave with the weather  Because it affects all of us  How much did it rain today  For example  How hot is it outside  You know  And one of my friends  That works at a local station  Down in Florida  Says their edict  Actually is  Give them a reason  To not run weather  Is the number one story  That day  Otherwise they're gonna do it  Wow  Yeah  There was a  I remember  God last winter  Or every winter  As a matter of fact 
[02:26:00]  They'll say  Snow in our area  We'll have  Blah blah blah  With the forecast  Yeah  And then you watch  And realize  The area  Is their broadcast rain  Yeah it's exactly  Which gets to  Northern Jersey  That's right  And areas where  The weather is as different  As the Bahamas  Hundreds of miles out  It's just  Yeah they'll get like  Eight feet of snow  And we're at 80 degrees  Yeah  Snow for our area  We'll tell you about it  Coming up  Are you normal  Thursday at 11 
[02:26:30]  On News 8  Are you normal  These are fantastic  This is the Hall of Fame  Oh my gosh  You see people  With Down Syndrome  Watching  Holding rabbits feet  This is the Hall of Fame  There Drew  Are you normal  Are you normal  What the hell  Kind of question is  It's great  Well local guys  Local TV guys  In particular  At the end of the book  I talk about  Like what media  Needs to be doing  To fix this problem  And the problem  Really it's threefold  The first problem  Is we have a 24 hour  News cycle  So you gotta talk 
[02:27:00]  About crap all the time  We got all the 24 hour  Channels on in here  And there's basically  Garbage on all of them  You know  It's like you just can't  Just can't  There's nothing to talk  About all day long  When you had half an hour  To do the day's news  You could fill it with news  But you go all day  And all of a sudden  You're like  Oh man we're out of stuff  What are we gonna do  Quick talk about  The abandoned horses  In Montana  For ten minutes  Then you've got  The problem of  You've got the fact  That nothing's going on  All the time  Combined with the internet  Which really screwed  Things up for the media  What happened is  Is that when we  When the internet 
[02:27:30]  Came into play  All of a sudden  You can track  Traffic per article  And it turns out  That Newsweek and Time  And CNN and all these guys  They do these focus groups  And they say  Well what do you guys  Like to read in Newsweek  And people go  Oh I like the sports  I like the politics  But nobody ever said  I really like the articles  About people fucking dogs  And it turns out  If you look at the traffic patterns  That's what people click on  That's what people click on first  Five, ten times traffic  People having sex with dogs  Lindy Lohan's cooter  I mean anything  That has nothing to do  With anything  That's what people actually click 
[02:28:00]  So if you're CNN  Oh hell  What do you do  Because now you're screwed  It turns out that  The business you're in  Is something that people  Actually don't care about  Have you noticed  CNN.com  They put a lot more  Entertainment stuff  On their front page  Than hard hitting news  Yeah check it right now  There will be some  Goofy crap on there  But what's even funnier  Is you can then compare it  To the most popular stories  Guess what the most  Popular stories are  Those articles  A lot of links  To like kibbles and bits  And Alpo  They're also  They have a link 
[02:28:30]  To The Onion  Yes  On there  On their satire  And you click on that  And people have actually  Thought it's real news  Yeah well you know  Yahoo's been doing that  For a while with them  Andrew Sullivan I think  And some other guys  And in fact for a while  They syndicate content  And for a while  They were doing  The weekly world news  But in very small print  It said what the source was  And so they say stuff like  Bad boy scene on moon  And it's like right next  To the AP feed  And you're like  Whoa holy crap  That guy's real  That's great  Guy's real  Got another one for you  The problem solvers  Have uncovered sexual predators

[02:31:00]  Actually listen to the real stuff  You're like oh my god  Yeah that can't be real  What the hell  Yeah  And finally this one  Sex offenders may be in your house  And I love it  In your house  Yeah they're just walking around  Hey go take a look  That's right  Hope they're cooking dinner  There's a guy jacking off  To a Jack and Jill magazine  Just sitting on the couch  How's it going  Highlights  Yeah daddy  The Gooferson Gallant page  Is stuck together  Again  Amazing  Oh it's awesome  Yeah  So what's the name 
[02:31:30]  Of the book there Drew  It's called  It's not news  It's FARC  How mass media  Passes off crap  As news  The easy way to remember  That is just look for FARC  Just punch that into Amazon  And it's at all the bookstores  And what not  And I mean  In the media fear mongering  Is just the tip of the iceberg  Like one of my favorites  Is seasonal articles  Where basically every time  Of the year  At the same time  They will have articles come out  Halloween  Yeah Halloween  Here we go  They're going to have  Simultaneously one article  That will tell you both  Where to x-ray your candy  And that's an urban legend  In the same article  Yeah  They will do that  Culture of fear  Which I'll say it again 
[02:32:00]  I love this book  And they talked exactly about that  As far as the Halloween stories  Yes  And they did their research  And they found  They can only find  I forgot  It's been years  There's three  It was not  Yeah  It was like  Less than ten kids  Over the years  Died from being poisoned by candy  And then they  They looked deeper  Into these cases  And found out  Most of them were  From their own family  Their own parents  Yep  Because they wanted  To collect some insurance money  Or they're trying to cover up  Like one of them  Was a cocaine overdose  And so they said  Oh they put cocaine 
[02:32:30]  In the candy  So it turns out  Like they couldn't even find  You know  Really  Where this is an epidemic  To the point  Where they have to do  These stories every year  Exactly  To protect your children  From you know  Being poisoned  And the razor blades  And the fans  And all that crap  Well you know  And one of the comments  On FARC  On those articles  Were great  They're like  You know  If I don't have any candy  Can I go to the hospital  And get like  If my arm's been hurting  For a while  Can I get that x-rayed  Because that's like  A $1,000 procedure  Right right  You're just x-raying stuff  Can I stick my foot in there  X-raying your candy  Yeah it's like  You know 
[02:33:00]  Let me get that checked out  One of the other  Unsubstantiated seasonal ones  They've got  Comes out  Actually it's a two-parter now  It's the Friday  After Thanksgiving  Where they talk about  How it's the busiest  Shopping day of the year  It's not  The busiest shopping day  Of the year  Is the last shopping day  Before Christmas Eve  Which is usually  Christmas Eve  Yeah  The other article  That comes out  Same time  Now they've been doing  Wait wait wait  Let me slow you down  But why would they say that  Well because  It was one of those things  With conventional wisdom  People said it  And believed it  And then eventually  Somebody got around  To doing research  And it turned out 
[02:33:30]  That it was completely  So maybe some dumb  Local news channel  Started years ago  And then everyone else  Just jumped on  Everybody just kept repeating  And figured it's got to be real  Right exactly  That's how it started  But they didn't know  Where it actually started  That's kind of interesting  No one checks  And the significance of that  By the way  Because like who gives a shit  What's the most  Popular shopping day of the year  It's like what else  Are they just assuming is right  Yes exactly  Well there's a bunch of stuff  Because now the follow up  Is that the Monday  After Thanksgiving  They say that it's called  Cyber Monday  Where basically it's the busiest 
[02:34:00]  Online shopping day of the year  Online shopping day  Complete and utter horse shit  It's absolutely not real  Two years ago  A PR firm issued a press release  Saying that  And everybody started repeating it  It's completely bogus  There's no study  That backs that up at all  Wow  The busiest shopping day  Of the year online  Guess what  The last possible day  Before Christmas  You can get stuff  To your house  It's the same thing  Because nobody  Everybody procrastinates  Nobody knows  When you go into the mall  On Christmas Eve  Because you fucked up  And now have to sit there  And sit in a crowd  And shop 
[02:34:30]  You know is the busiest day  Yes  It is  Well you can tell  Because you're stuck  In those damn lines  That go out the door  And you're like  Huge lines  The place is ravaged  Like it's been looted  There's nothing to buy  Grandma's getting the slippers again  Yep  Exactly  Well the reason they run  Those articles around that time  Is because they've basically  They've all gone on vacation already  Nobody works Thursday, Friday  And then nobody's got anything  In the hopper for Monday  In the media  So these are standbys  They can run those  The other one they like is  Oh my god  There's going to be traffic  Over Thanksgiving 
[02:35:00]  Yeah  Really?  You don't stay  Tell me what roads are wide open  So I can just gun it  Because you know  I don't care if there's traffic  Of course there's traffic  Yeah  There's always traffic  The shark stories  Yes  In the summer  Are huge  It's the pre-warning stories  That they give you  About sharks  And weather  And things like that  That I love too  Every single year  That every year  The hurricane season  That's upcoming  Is going to be the worst  In years  Absolutely  And then it turns out  Why? 
[02:35:30]  What happened?  Where was it?  We had nothing this year  And they never say  Anything about it  They never go  You know  Remember at the beginning  Of the summer  We said this hurricane season  Was going to be worse  Well we fucked up  Why doesn't that guy get fired?  I mean seriously  Shouldn't you get fired?  When you're like the top  Weather expert in the United States  And you miss that badly  Yeah  You should be fired  We had no hurricanes this year  No  Not last year either  Yeah  It's the same thing  Two years in a row  Yeah two years in a row  I think the reason they do it  Is because like  If you say  There's going to be a ton of hurricanes  And they're not  Everybody just kind of laughs  And goes  Ha ha what an idiot  But if you say  There's going to be no hurricanes 
[02:36:00]  And New Orleans gets wiped off the map  You're fired  Then you're fired  You're out of a job  Then you're fired  Then you're fired  Yeah what else do you get into in the book?  Talk about unpaid placement  Masquerading as articles  This is weird because  When I first mentioned this  It sounds like what I'm saying is  Is that people can actually buy articles  And in some cases that's true  But I'm talking about  The situations where you can craft  A press release in such a way  That it'll get run as an article  For example  Expensive food  Thousand dollar hamburger  Nobody buys this crap  Right  But restaurants do it as PR 
[02:36:30]  So they can say  Well at such and such a restaurant  You can buy a thousand dollar hamburger  Boy rich people are stupid  And that's basically the article  The whole thing  And I think that's kind of funny  Because if that's the case  I mean I've got a three thousand dollar jug of milk  In my fridge at home  Can I get some CNN time?  I mean you know  Is that all it takes?  I never even noticed that  Because yeah  A lot of these restaurants  Put it on their menu  They put a five thousand dollar dessert  Exactly  Restaurant right across the street  We go to  Down the way  Yeah  Parker Meridian has a thousand dollar omelet  Or something like that  It's caviar  Yeah  Yeah yeah 
[02:37:00]  There you go  Yeah they got media coverage  It's something like that  Yeah  A thousand dollar omelet  And they do  They cover it  And the hotel knows  They're not going to sell  One of these damn things  Yeah exactly  It's just going to get news  Pretty much yeah  It's going to get press  Well like for example  You know it's seasonal  But it's also unpaid placement  That whole  How much does the 12 days of Christmas cost?  What a complete  Bugus article that is  Because no one buys that shit  No  You're not going to go out  And buy this stuff  Who would buy a turtle dove?  They're making it up  Where do you get a turtle dove?  Yeah  And what do you do with it  When you got it anyways?  That kind of stuff  Dumb song that doesn't make 
[02:37:30]  Any sense nowadays  Exactly  Maybe back in the day  It made sense  I don't know  Yeah I doubt it  The other one that comes out  All the time  Is any sporting event  Where some jackass  Will go out there  And say  Yeah so we're losing  800 million dollars  Because people are watching  The Super Bowl  As if anybody is watching  Working on Sunday  Some people are  800 million dollars lost?  What?  That's not possible  It's completely bogus  And every year  They kick it up 20 million  When I wrote the book  It was 780 million  It was 800 last year  Who's losing?  Businesses?  Yeah  The economy 
[02:38:00]  I don't know  They don't even say who it is  Yeah they don't say who  Maybe it's us  Maybe it's us personally  You know how much money  People spend on their Super Bowl plays?  Nobody's working then anyways  They're actually spending  A lot more money  Than an average Sunday  Yeah basically  Well like they also try to do stuff  Like lost work productivity  Due to you know  The World Series  Whatever you know  They're just making that number up  And it's not like people work  8 hours solid a day anyway  Everybody screws off  For at least half of it  That's normal  Yeah  So how do you think  This will play out  On FARC.com 
[02:38:30]  We're assholes  You're a dick  You shouldn't have been on this show  I'm selling out  You're selling out  That's what I'm doing  Let's see  O&A rule  It'll turn into an O&A  Versus Howard thing  Yep  And then you'll suck  For being on our show  And then Hitler will show up  And then  Hitler's always working in the wings  And then the squirrel  With the giant balls  That's right  Will make everyone feel better  Exactly  And  You can't win  No you can't  I don't know how anyone 
[02:39:00]  Runs a message board  Or any type of media board  Yeah I don't either  Or  You win by not reading it  Yeah basically  I mean  Yeah that's how I win  I really do  I pretty much stop  There's certain things  That I want to read  The comments on  Because some of them  You look and  You read the article  And go  Oh I wonder  There must be a lot of comments  And you look and go  Oh yeah  It goes to that infinite  Infinite number  Well some of our most famous threads  Have been like  One of the ones  Is a guy that wrote in  And the guys on Fark  On Total Fark  The subscription part of the site  They have conversations 
[02:39:30]  With you all day long  And once in a while  You'll get just a classic one  That we'll put to the main page  One of the ones in particular  That comes to mind  Was a guy that wrote in  To ask whether or not  A cat's butthole  Actually touches the counter  When it sits down  Because he and his wife  Were having this argument  The wife didn't want the cat  To sit up on the counter  Because she said  It's ass is touching the counter  And you're going to get  Cat ass on all the food  So he writes in  And he's like  Does anybody know the answer to this  Or is there some kind of ring  Pop down and cover the cat's asshole up  Somebody suggested  Yeah but even that ring  Would have to  It's still attached to the asshole 
[02:40:00]  To the cat  So somebody suggested  That he grab the cat  Take a lipstick  And put a ring of lipstick  Around the asshole  Of the cat  And then put the cat  Back in the counter  And so if you find  Asshole prints on the counter  Then you know  That's a scientist  Oh it's genius  Wow  Fantastic  Any response  Yeah he didn't do it  I didn't put lipstick  On his cat  I don't think  The cat all sits  The long stuff  That better be  One declawed  D-teethed cat  True you love this stuff  Where does it come from man  Which stuff  Just the submission to me 
[02:40:30]  Just all this quirky  News you'd find  And you know  The fear mongering  And obviously  You wrote a book about it  Like did something  Happen growing up  Where you're like  Oh my god  I gotta study this stuff  No what actually happened  I kind of backed into it  Basically the stuff  That I always read  In the newspaper  Was like the news  Of the weird  Like that would just  Catch my eye  For some reason  World news  That was a fave  Oh yeah it was great  All that stuff  I would always like  Find this stuff  And this was like  Back you know  When the internet came out  I would start emailing  Friends of mine  When I would find  Media stuff  Every once in a while  And so after a while  I was  This was happening so often 
[02:41:00]  I was like  Well okay  Screw this  You guys with this email anymore  I'm gonna put it up  On a website  If you guys like it  There it'll be  And that was literally  How it started  I really got a passion for it  Yeah  Well it's funny  Did you buy into  The whole Bigfoot  And Loch Ness Monster  Crap when you were growing up  Oh no not at all  No in fact  Well I've actually got  A chapter in the book  About that  I call it  Equal time for whack jobs  Basically where  Like if you're a journalist  You're taught to give  Equal time to both sides  Of a story right  You know if you're  Talking about you know  Social security  What's the best way  To fix it  Well these guys think this  These guys think that  Right  Okay well let's 
[02:41:30]  Did the moon landing happen  You know for example  There are guys that don't  Think the moon landing  Happened  And anytime they mention  The moon landing  40th anniversary  Or whatever  And I was gonna go  Talk to those jackasses  That think oh it's fake  There's a sound stage  You know  Explain the flag then  Yeah exactly  You know it's like  The flag is kind of  Blowing in the wind there  There's no wind on the moon  It's like yeah  It's a strange moon wind  But you got these guys  The problem with that  Is that they give publicity  To people that don't deserve it  Like the guys that don't think  The holocaust happened  For example  The only reason we know  That anybody doesn't think  The holocaust happened 
[02:42:00]  Is because these journalists  Put it in as equal time  When there isn't any equal time  And it's all funny  But at the same time  There was an interesting story  That came out of England  Where it turns out  That a lot of the  Radical Islamic leaders  In England  Got publicity  And people found them  Because of the tabloids  In England  Talking to the most  Obnoxious people  They could find  On anything to do with Islam  And then all these guys  Found it  And it turns out  They trained them to be bombs  And blew up a whole bunch  Of subways a few years later  Thanks for that  Jesus  You get the same people 
[02:42:30]  Pretty much writing  The titles to some of the articles  Oh yes  Are they all  Because some of them  We read them in the morning  And just laugh our asses  At some of the titles  Some are hysterical  In fact I tell people  That the humor we're looking for  Is something where you laugh  And you're embarrassed  Like for example  This is actually an article  And a title  And Miss Deaf Texas  Was hit by a train  That actually happened  Can you imagine that  Just like  What was she doing  Walking down the tracks anyway  You know it's like  But that actually happened  It was Texas  Was hit by a train  Or like I tell people also  One of the things  That happened right after 
[02:43:00]  The Columbia disaster  Was there was an article  About you know  They're going into sidebars  At this point  Because it's three days later  Nothing to talk about  So they have an article  On all the stuff  That people are turning in  Because you know  There's debris everywhere  Over a hundred miles  And so people are finding  Parts of the space shuttle  And turning it in  And so it's an article  About stuff that people  Had turned in  That wasn't the space shuttle  For example  Somebody turned in  A stump  As if you know  I guess they had trees  On the Columbia  Or something like that  Trees  Stump  Somebody had a  Turned in a piece  Of toast too 
[02:43:30]  Which I guess  Was probably  At one point  A loaf of bread  In orbit  That fell to earth  And cooked on the way  Down or something  I don't know  And the tagline we used  Was just because  The Columbia is toast  Does not mean that  Toast is the Columbia  For example  That is funny  Oh it's great stuff  The book is  What there Drew  It's not news  It's far  How mass media  Passes off  Crap is news  And you'll laugh  Your ass off  The entire way through  It's not a very serious book  But at the same time  You come away  And you laugh  And you think  Ah crap  This stuff is right  Right on  I can't wait  I'm going to read that one  Excellent  And I mean it this time  Yeah cool  Sometimes people give us books  They go I'm going to read it 
[02:44:00]  And I don't  But this one I'm going to read  Actually the same thing  Happens to me  I get them shipped into  I'm going to read that  And then no  Why would I  But this one I'm going to read  Excellent  Hey Stephen King liked it  That's what I tell people  Oh there you go  He did  We got a jacket quote  He actually liked my book too  Yeah excellent  I made that up  You actually got a quote  From Stephen King  Yeah yeah  God damn  My mom went to high school  With him that's why  He's  Oh really  Yeah well yeah  She didn't know him  Vice versa  She was kind of a creepy guy  You know whatever  But it turns out  That also the publisher  That we got this under  His wife is Stephen King's agent 
[02:44:30]  And so at one point  He was in town  For a Red Sox game  Or something  And they gave me  Of course he was  Yeah  Like one of those damn socks  We're trying to get  Stephen King on the show  Oh very cool  Because he's got a great take  On pop culture  Oh yeah sure  Yeah  Does he still write  For Entertainment Weekly  Yeah he does  I used to read it all the time  I haven't in a while  But man it's great  Yeah he wrote a fantastic article  After Virginia Tech  About you know the fact  Like how if you're a teacher  Because he's taught  You know how do you recognize  Somebody that's likely  To shoot up an entire school  And he says in his entire 
[02:45:00]  Teaching career  There was one guy  That he remembers  That wrote some of the  Most horrific stuff  He's like there's horror writing  And then there's guys  You think will actually do it  And he says there was one guy  That he remembers  That hasn't shot anybody  To his knowledge  But there's one guy  And he wonders about that guy  To this day  Wow  Yeah creepy  And every other person  He just thought  Was just some kid  Yeah just idiots  Creative writing  Just some dumb kid  That's right  Yeah pretty much  That's really interesting  Alright we're gonna take a break  We got Rick Shapiro here  I mean hang  Do the hang  Okay yeah  Love to  We also got Francine  We got a bunch of listeners

[02:50:30]  I lost our memory  Her boot came right out  Is there a picture  Yeah somewhere  I'm sure it's on the internet  But they had  800 and some odd complaints  It's gotta be on the internet  Everything's on the internet  They had 800 and some odd complaints  And it turned out  When they actually  When you collated them down  Because you get this  From Freedom of Information Act  They got all the complaints  Some guy  And then basically  They filtered out all the copies  You know like the form letters  And whatever  There were three complaints  Three  Three  Out of how many people  Were watching  500  Two billion  I don't know  Perhaps more than that  Jim  Yeah  And that incident 
[02:51:00]  Is changing the world  Yeah  And it was three stupid people  It was three  They had 800 copies  Yeah three people  I bet they had more people  That said you know  You guys need more tits  In the Superbowl  Yeah  There are more people  That run in  Yeah show more boobs  That's what I would see  How the hell  Does everybody just fold  And run in fear  Over three people complaining  I don't know why they do that  I mean even if it's a thousand  Who gives a shit  The majority of the people  Don't give a shit  No  The thousand isn't going to  Hurt in your bottom line  No  Tell them to go fuck themselves  And watch Sesame Street

[02:59:00]  Love this  Yeah  Mayor Bloomberg's  Company is in deep  Shit for demoting  Pregnant women  Mayor Bloomberg  Who initially denied  He knew of these  Circumstances  Is now saying that  Quote  I am the majority  Owner  And I know  What's going on  Well here's my opinion  Let's face it  Pregnant women  Are a liability  They're emotional  Racks with fat feet  And leaky tits  If there is anything  We can learn 
[02:59:30]  From this incident  It is not that  Mayor Bloomberg  Is a liar  That we as a human race  Need to figure out  Alternative ways  To reproduce  Amen  Alternative ways  To reproduce  How  How do you do that  Apparently we're doing it wrong  I guess  How are you gonna do that  Francine  We'll find out  Other ways  To have babies  Besides women  Carrying them  Because I don't  Want to carry any  Oh I heard  If you let a girl  Blow you  But you make sure  You keep her lips  Closed after  The sperm  Doesn't die  And it gestates 
[03:00:00]  It gestates  That's what we should do  We should  You should blow a load  In a girl's mouth  And then she spits it  Into a baboon pussy  Real quick  And that carries  Absolutely  I think that requires  Some field research here  I think it would be worth  I'm gonna look into this  But amazing right Drew  Yeah it's great  I just saw  Happy Typing Girls  Panties  You gotta be careful  On those bleachers  You gotta be very careful  On those bleachers  I know it's too late  Now I turn around  It's gone  What color are they

[03:02:00]  Men's room  Allegedly trying to  Solicit sex  From an undercover cop  Insists that he's  Neither a turd burglar  Neither a pillow biter  And that defaggotatious  Allegations against him  Are all false  Senator Craig's  Republican peers  Especially Republican  Representative  Nevada Senator  John Ensign  Insists that he  Steps down  Senator Craig joins  Butt-loving Republicans  Mark Foley  Of Florida  And Jim McGreevy

[03:04:00]  Harassment allegations  Against Madison Square Garden's  Isaiah Thomas  And James Dolan  Brown says  She was called  A bitch in a hall  And was subject  To mistreatment  During her tenure  At the garden  In my opinion  The 11.6 million dollars  Should be taken away  From this whiny old bitch  And given back to us  The fans  Who wasted our time  And money  Supporting this  Awful team  Of losing ass wipes  For years  Why don't you give us  A fucking championship  Title

[03:05:00]  Wearing little skirts  With the little underwear  To get a little raise  And stuff  You've run no underwear  Only when I run out  But I have run out  Of underwear  At work  No like if  I have like six months  Worth of underwear  So if I get too tired  Or like I can't do it  Because I used to work  Two jobs  I just used to pile up  All my dirty clothes  In like one corner  Of my room  For six months  Yeah  Big pile of underwear  With gulls  Gulls flying around  No kidding  You have no panties  On right now  No I have on panties

[03:07:00]  And I thought it was really painful  And not very  You know  Accelerating  Was it a big one  Did you have a big one  In your pooper  Actually I did  That's probably why  Yeah  Yeah  Just takes a while  To get used to  You'll get used to it  Exactly  Just put a sign up  Like Jim said  It says we've changed our policy  That's right  So  So why are you rethinking it  Did you know it hurts  Did you do something  With a finger  Or a dildo  That's right  My finger in my butthole

[03:08:30]  On ass sex  Um  Well I'm talking  To a couple of guys  Right now  And I think  I'm gonna decide  Which one I'm gonna  Have sex with  In like  Maybe a couple weeks  Okay  And then I'm gonna  Try it  Oh let me do it  It kills the screaming  In my head  What?  When I wrap an ass  Around my head  The voices go away  Who's uh  Who are the guys?  Uh  One's uh 
[03:09:00]  A fellow comedian  Friend of mine  And another guy  Jimmy Norton  Yeah  And  Cause I don't  Do comedy anymore  So  Before like  One of my comedy  Friends used to  Why aren't you  Doing comedy anymore?  Because um  I don't know  I've been working  For like two years  It's been really  Hard to do it  And plus it's  Really expensive  And plus all I did  Was get drunk  Half the time anyway  Well that makes it  More expensive  Yeah  Yeah I did a lot 
[03:09:30]  Of drinking  And I got really sick  Yeah  Alright  And so uh  It's a  Comedic friend of yours  And who else?  One of my friends  Who's in finance  Wouldn't you go  With the finance guy  Cause then maybe  You get some cash  Cause you have a cash problem  I'm thinking  It's the same thing  Yeah  Yeah I figured you would  Yeah  So when are you gonna  Decide in a couple weeks?

[03:10:00]  Whether they have  Ass sex with you  Or not  Um  What do you mean  Questions?  We just talked about  Well you said  You're deciding  So there's gotta be  Something you're doing  In your head  Like you're probably  Asking certain questions  Or what  Well it's really  Who gives me  More attention  Yeah  Yeah  If you go with a guy  You gotta go with a guy  Who doesn't have money  Cause your asshole  Will be the best table  He's had in a long time  He'll appreciate it  You can fuck harder  When you're broke  Well maybe not 
[03:10:30]  That's what happened  To me  Alright  Your final story  There Francine  That's all we're gonna  Get from the SX  I figure  Oh wait  We got  Entertainment bed  Let's go  There we go  Working out the cobwebs  Out of Jennifer Aniston's  Twat  Is soon to be  Star of  Butt Pirates of the Caribbean  Star Orlando Bloom  According to Star Magazine  The two stars  Are seeing each other  And may become  A hot item  Congratulations to you 
[03:11:00]  And your cooch  Jen  Good for you  Why a Jennifer Aniston story  If you can do one  Entertainment story  Britney Spears  Why Britney Spears  Cause she lost her kids  She's a train wreck  A day  It's pretty easy  Yeah  But there's nothing  Funny about it  I feel bad for her  There's a lot of  Interest in Britney Spears  Though  And you have a  You have a nice  Take on things  So I would assume  You would go  With the Britney Spears  Well actually  I also had a story  In Horse Face  Tori Spelling  But  Nay 
[03:11:30]  I thought that  It was between  The two of them  But I don't find  A lot of interest  In Britney  I just feel  Really really bad for her  Cause she already  Had kids  You know  And she's fat now  And it's like  It's really mean  To keep bashing on her  Yeah  She's a multi-millionaire  It sucks  She cries herself  To sleep  Every night  On a giant pile of money  Yeah  She's kind of  Playing into it  A little bit too  You know  Oh you want to  Beat up on Britney too  Oh I can't get  Enough of it  Well I like her  I like her music too 
[03:12:00]  It's great  Leave Britney alone right  Yeah  I'm with the gay guy  I think we should  Leave her alone  She'll probably  Just kill herself  Soon anyway  Well that's the obvious thing  I think she'll get help  I hope so  Alright  Awkward  Alright thanks Francine  You're welcome  That's Francine with the news  Drew what do you think  A little review of her news  I actually  I hope Britney Spears  Doesn't kill herself  Because then she'll be  Some kind of an icon  For the rest of our lives  And that's the last thing  I think anybody wants to see  Oh my god  Yeah she's so interesting  In the news 
[03:12:30]  You hate to see that one  Fucking go  Oh man no kidding  Yeah the pregnancy thing  Is interesting  Because it's something  I've noticed  A couple times  It's happened  Like recently in the news  They've been talking about  People having these  These nurse-ins  Because they were  Kicked off of an airplane  Or out of a restaurant  Or whatever  And so they want to be able  To breastfeed in public  Right  The thing about these  Is like you really  Got to wonder  Because every time  I've seen this  The person's been  Ass ugly  Like it's never been  A hot chick that was told  Oh please don't breastfeed here  It's always someone  Who was just nasty  And when you actually  Check out what's going on  Behind the scenes  You find out that 
[03:13:00]  What's happened is  Is that the woman  Who's complaining  About getting thrown  Out of a place  Contacts the media first  Media contacts the place  The place can't comment  Because they don't know  What the hell happened  Until they consult  Their attorneys  And so what happens  Is you get the one version  Of the story out  In particular  Where I live in Kentucky  There's a Delta hub  Up near Cincinnati  A woman was thrown  Off a plane for breastfeeding  Made a huge stink about it  And people are all  How could you make her  Not breastfeed in public  What's wrong with you  Well it turns out  Apparently  She weighed 300 pounds  And was like  Whipping them out 
[03:13:30]  Like walking down the aisle  Topless  Nasty as hell  Screaming and making  A fuss out of it  And that's why  They threw it off  The airplane  Because she was  Being a bitch  You just said  That's why they  Threw it off the airplane  Threw her off the airplane  The baby  No but through it  Meaning that she's  Some sort of  A fucking sea creature  And you were right  She's ugly  Of course she was  And she was being obnoxious  It's the thing  It's like I mean  I've got two kids  My wife is still breastfeeding  And never ever a problem  Nobody says anything about it  But she's kind of  There are some breastfeeders  Out there  They love the shock value  Yeah they do  They love shocking people  By doing it in public  Yes exactly 
[03:14:00]  I got six kids  And I got a woman  Who's 600 pounds  Breastfeeding my kids  I just thought  I'd tell you that  I got more women  Breastfeeding my kids  Because I allow it  I'm for it  That's the stance I take  And I'm not backing down  Damn it  Yeah it's like  It's a rule I've been working on  I call it indignant outrage  Where what they'll do  Is they'll run a story  That's none of your damn business  That doesn't impact you  In any way  And then makes you mad  For example  Last Christmas 
[03:14:30]  There was a guy  And this sucks by the way  But it's not national news  There was a guy  Who got sent over to Iraq  Put all of his stuff in storage  And his credit card expired  While he was gone  Or so he says  And the company sold all his stuff  And so  And what's funny is  Is that you'll get a response  A much larger response  Out of an article like that  Or somebody that like  Kicks a dog somewhere  For example  Than you will about anything  That's actually important  Like you know  Global warming or whatever  Yeah yeah  10,000 people will call  Over something as stupid as this  Another good example  Out in Colorado  There was a homeowners association  That told a guy  That he couldn't have 
[03:15:00]  A peace sign  In his Christmas decorations  Because it was  A satanic symbol  Now  That doesn't matter  Who cares  It's a homeowners association  Whatever  Now that's a stupid thing to say  But at the end of the day  This is nobody's business  Front page CNN  For 24 hours  Wow  Who cares  That kind of stuff  Yeah why is it like that  With people  Like I was away  For two months  Out of the country  I come back  It seems more like  That kind of shit  Like people interested  In dull shit  Yeah  Well it's been  It's been going on  For a while  The Daily Coast 
[03:15:30]  Did a great thing  That I love to talk about  In October of 2006  They took CNN's front page  Stripped off all the crap news  All the ads  All of what they call  YouTube voyeurism  In fact I just saw it  Come across  While we were sitting here  Talking about the news  They had the two headed turtle  That's what they call  YouTube voyeurism  It's basically just crap  That's on YouTube  And they read it as bumpers  Like look at the otters  Holding hands  You could probably see that  On a newscast  Right  And they took all that crap  Off of CNN's main page  And they were left  With five lines of text  That was it  And what they did was  Is then they compared it  To China News Daily  And you can't tell the difference  Between those two pages 
[03:16:00]  Because they're running all news  So people wrote in  And complained  And said well it's unfair  To compare it to China News Daily  So they went back  And they got a copy  Of CNN's home page  Out of 2,000  Out of the internet archive  And did the same thing  And you can't tell the difference  It's definitely slipped  It's gone from being  Total real news  To just complete garbage and crap  Well even when they have  Even when you watch CNN  It's like  Even when they're doing real news  Like Wolf Blitzer  Has to have a fucking music bed  Under him  Yeah  It's like why  Do you need a music bed  Why are you kidding  Pounding face  Yeah  What is that 
[03:16:30]  Yeah I have no idea  It doesn't make any sense  It's distracting  It's not helping the story  It's not informative  It's just douchey  And irritating  Well that show he's got too  Where they've got like  The dozen TV screens  With crap going on all of them  What the hell is going on  In the background there exactly  I know  Are there channels  Are we watching Fox  Yeah  On CNN  We're watching Fox and CNN  That's where it's gotten to  That'd be great  If it was all animal  Fucking pornography  That's right  That's where it's going  If somebody in the back  Just kind of switched it  Yeah  Well that was the funny thing  Is like we were talking about  People having sex with dogs  Being a traffic ratings grab 
[03:17:00]  There's a website  Called NC Buy in 2003  That made the mistake  Of you know how every year  Like around New Year's  They do the top ten stories  Of the year  Well and usually they'll pick  You know the biggest stories  Of the year  And it's usually  It's editorially controlled  Well this North Carolina newspaper  Made the mistake  And I've never seen anybody  Do this again  Of doing it based on traffic  To articles  Number one article  For 2003  Was a guy who beat  His son to death  Because he caught him  In a barn  Fucking the family dog  Number one story  It was fantastic  That's a big one  How old was the kid?  Like 12, 13 
[03:17:30]  I don't know  What kind of dog was it?  I have no idea  Golden Retriever or something  I don't know  Hey Drew  I think you're boring Anthony  Yeah you fell asleep over there  Look at that  It's great  I have a question for Drew  What's up?  What's the peace symbol  That resembles the Satan symbol?  It was just basically  Somebody trying to make  A big fuss out of it  And so somebody claimed  That the peace symbol  Is a satanic symbol  I have no idea  But which peace symbol is that?  I'm really confused  There's only one  It's that one  Isn't it this?  No no no  The circle with the lines 
[03:18:00]  Are you familiar with this?  You know  You've seen it many times  It looks like the Mercedes symbol  Yeah  That's it  I thought the satanic symbol  Was the one with the star  In the middle of the circle  Yeah the pentagram  Okay  I was just trying to like  Catch everything  It was just a lot of stuff  Oh Francine  Don't be fresh  We lost Anthony  And everyone's just having  A casual conversation  Yeah  I feel nauseous too 
[03:18:30]  I feel like I'm going to puke  Since we said  When I eat too much fruit  Mixed with coffee  It does something in my stomach  Anthony's out cold  And we're continuing to radio  We should all jerk off on him  We should just leave him  And he'll wake up  Just keep the channel live  With him sleeping  There you go  Lower the shade  I blame you Drew  You put him to sleep  I know I'm sorry 
[03:19:00]  Bill O'Reilly found out  That the two otters  Were gay  On YouTube  And he says  He's not against otters  He's just otters  Having gay sex  So he's not against  Gay otters  That's what a general said  A senator said  The general said  I'm against homosexuality  And the senator back here  Said I agree with  What he said  And then the press 
[03:19:30]  Came down on him  And said  This is how you really feel  That you're against homosexuality  He goes  I never said I was against  Homosexuality  Homosexuality's fine  I'm just against  Homosexual sex  You know  So what are they supposed to do  Go to Starbucks  And just wave at each other  Wave different CDs  At each other  Go to Target  And talk about sheets  Exactly  All those turgid cocks  No one can do anything with them  I know  I know  I didn't  Turgid  Turgid  I gotta look that up  Turgid I think

[03:20:30]  After the  Cutting room  Uh  And uh  I was supposed to tell you  I'm in a  I was in a car accident  And I hallucinated  Being chased by pine nuts  Which is true  Wait what?  My friend said  I had a concussion  And I walked around  And I would slam the door  And say  Shut the door  I'm being chased by pine nuts  Like I had a concussion  I was talking to my phone  Putting people on hold  And I was making out  With girls that weren't there 
[03:21:00]  I was just like  Like that  This is what my friends  Told me  So I just thought  That'd be interesting  Why pine nuts?  They're such a yummy treat  I don't even think about pine nuts  Why not walnuts  Are food I don't like  Pine nuts are delish  I never even think about pine nuts  That's why  They're great in a salad though  You have fucking  What's better than pine nuts  In a salad?  Candy corns  I stand correct  Rick and I are doing our own show  It's called  It's called  I fucked up  I was trying to think of  What you'd call  Little things that go in salad 
[03:21:30]  And I realized I had nothing  Salad treats  I'm just amazed  He's out cold  Yeah  I thought he was faking  But no  No, no  He's out  Narcolepsy strikes  I'm so mad  I let that salad improv go  I didn't catch it  I didn't catch it  It was my fault  No, no  I didn't have anything  I flubbed it  I just saw this thing  Of us riffing on salad  For a good 40 minutes  Chickpeas  That's what we need

Put a little vanilla extract  Behind your ears 
[03:22:30]  You'll attract a man  With a country home  She fucking wrote me a text  Before she flew today  And I always say to her  Before I leave  Like hey  You know  Just in case I'm killed  In the plane crash  I'll talk to you later  And she's like  That's not  Don't say that  So she fucking wrote  Plane is so small  If I die  I love you  And I died feeling  A little sad  You didn't text me back  I don't want you to carry  The weight and feel guilty  Just learn from it  And go on to be a better man  Good  That's impressive man  It's encouraging  And I know if she died 
[03:23:00]  In a plane crash  I wouldn't go on  To be a better man  I would just get a whore  And forget  Just pay for a blowjob  Hey  A man  Not a saint  Remember that  I deserve more  That was very funny  Yeah  Let me see  So Rick is going to be where?
