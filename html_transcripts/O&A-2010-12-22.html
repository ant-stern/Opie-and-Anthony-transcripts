<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts lamenting their decision to work on a day they could have taken off, resulting in a show heavily saturated with commercials.  They jokingly brainstormed creative ways to integrate the ads, even suggesting a live shave on-air. Opie shared his suspected Christmas tree allergy, attributing his annual Christmas colds to it, prompting reminiscences about their chaotic childhood Christmases and their father's volatile personality.  These stories included anecdotes about their father's yelling matches with their mother, his questionable methods of acquiring the Christmas tree (using stolen vending machine money), his haphazard tree-trimming skills, and generally chaotic decorating style. They even showcased home videos from their childhood, including footage of themselves dressed as young Vito Corleones.  The discussion also touched upon their parents' marriage and the circumstances surrounding Opie's conception.

In-studio guests throughout the show included Paul (a former intern working at Sirius), Pat from Menaki, Bobo, and Nervous Oscar.  A significant portion of the show revolved around a purported foot fetish video allegedly featuring Rex Ryan and his wife, with the hosts previewing a planned staff reenactment.  Sam's mother, Bobby, joined via phone and provided Christmas cookies, which were extensively sampled and praised.  The conversation with Bobby included sexually suggestive and crude humor, details about her family life (including her husband's war experiences and her father's Christmas Eve readings), and observations about her appearance.  Her personality and baking style were humorously compared to a 1950s housewife.  Other topics included a Hot 97 DJ who wasn't fired for an offensive joke, the Spider-Man musical's mishaps, and plans to "take out" Martha Stewart.  The movie "Little Fockers" was also reviewed.  Numerous listeners called in, and regular contributors like Pat from Menaki and Patty (Stalker Patty) also appeared.

A luggage store employee shared a story about nearly hitting his sister's stepfather after a frustrating birthday party videography incident, which led to discussions about his family dynamics (revealing his sister having a different father).  Roland, another in-studio guest, expressed his dislike for Bobo due to allegedly unreasonable coffee requests.  Patty, a Starbucks employee, joined, sharing crude anecdotes about customer interactions and witty comebacks, including a story about a customer demanding money and her childhood experience of having her transistor radio stolen. This prompted a discussion on childhood discipline, including spankings with a yardstick.  Bobo's family history and multiple parents were also discussed.

Vinny from the Jersey Shore joined the show, sharing stories about a night of heavy drinking and driving, a car accident involving a friend, and his family's reaction to his fame.  The hosts and guests compared drinking habits and experiences.  The conversation included discussions about the Jersey Shore show, future seasons, and its personalities. The alleged Rex Ryan foot fetish video was revisited, along with further off-color anecdotes and jokes.

The show continued with a discussion about the upcoming season of Jersey Shore, focusing on the cast's dynamics and Angela's absence, with vulgar descriptions of cast members.  A listener called in with a question about avoiding the "friend zone," leading to crude dating advice.  An unexpected visit from Kenya, a former Hits1 intern, resulted in flirtatious banter, dancing, suggestive comments, and attempts to obtain her phone number.  Oscar, a caller, joined the flirtation, attempting to impress Kenya with dancing and a song.  Bobo called in seeking dating advice for a Stop and Shop cashier.  The segment concluded with discussion of Vinny's clothing line and further flirtatious interactions with Kenya before the show ended.  Throughout the broadcast, frequent profane language, sexual innuendo, and discussions of inappropriate behavior were prevalent.

[00:00:30]  That's astounding to me  I didn't want to say it's racist, but god damn  This show will rock as best as we can possibly do this radio show  I'm gonna go home and whack to a tranny later  There you go, alright  God, we just lost our demo, man  What's wrong with you?  This is the last draw for the watching radio duo  The Obie Ken Anthony show  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  And we're live, yes  Why, I don't know 
[00:01:00]  We sneaked right up to Christmas  We're great like that  We're good like that  Yeah, yeah  What's strange is we could have taken off the entire week  And no one around here would have cared  No one would have cared  But for some reason we feel like we need to be here  We need to entertain the people  We have a need, like you said, to entertain  It transcends my own pleasure, relaxation, vacation 
[00:01:30]  It's just my need to entertain the masses  The need to feed the ego  Right  So I want to thank yous all day long today  Because we could have easily stepped out  Yeah  No one would have blamed us  You pricks  Although it's going to be one long infomercial today  Yeah, it pretty much is  Look, I'm warning you right now  I don't want to hear one complaint  Look, I love the fact that a lot of people want to advertise on our show  But oh my god  Oh my god  We should tell the people  Because we're getting new listeners all the time 
[00:02:00]  Yeah  It's not usually an infomercial  Oh no  On a regular week  You got one or two live reads here and there  Yep  But everyone wants to squeeze their shit in  Their Christmas goods  Their Christmas goods, sorry  Christmas goods  And then they got, you know, around Valentine's Day we get the same thing  It gets a little rough  Mother's Day  Mother's Day gets a little rough  Yeah, there's just certain holidays  Groundhog's Day, a little rough  Maybe two extra reads on Groundhog's Day  Okay  For a happy Groundhog Day, Vermont teddy bear or something 
[00:02:30]  Yeah  But don't think that we do nothing but live reads  Because that's what it's going to feel like today  Yeah, it really is going to feel that way for you today  So just batten down the hatches and deal with it  How about you just buy some of this stuff and then we don't have to do the live reads anymore  We should  Buy some flowers, buy some PJs, buy some chocolates  Yeah  What else we hawk in today?  We should just be able to  Razors, jewelry  Incorporate it into the show where I go like  Opie, man, look how grubby I am today 
[00:03:00]  I didn't use my Panasonic Multiflex razor today  That was smooth  And it just, I'm all grubby  I can't wait to get home and put those four nanotech blades over my face  To get a smooth, close shave  How about you just shave live on the air?  We got one?  Oh my god  This could be like old time TV  Old timey TV  Why not?  Like when Ed McMahon used to feed the dog Alpo during the middle of the Tonight Show 
[00:03:30]  I didn't even know that they're now doing a commercial  I thought this was a bit  It was trickery  What do they call that?  What was that dumb corporate word they used?  Oh yeah  Integration  Integration  Integrated into your program  I don't like the word anyway  But when it comes to  When it comes to live reads  Live reads, yes  All the thank yous are coming in  Alright, you guys are alright  In my book  At least they're  In my book  Maybe one lousy hater will understand today that we do care 
[00:04:00]  Because we could have taken the whole week off  The whole god damn week  Oh care, right  Yes, we care  Yes, yes  Yeah, we could have taken the whole week off  And I just want to announce to everyone that I'm sick just in time for Christmas  And I'm going to ruin my son's first Christmas  Cheers, everyone  Cheers  Merry, merry  Merry Christmas to everybody  I am so fucking sick  I think  I think something's happening with me too 
[00:04:30]  Really?  Yeah, yeah  I got like the top of the back of my throat  I'm feeling a little raw  And raspy  And then I'll be talking and have like  Hear that?  I'll have to do that a lot  And then swallow a lot  And it just feels like  Oh, you're getting the swallows?  I think it's coming in  A little sickness  I got a theory on my  My clogged nose  Clogged nose  And it hit me on the way in today  Yeah  And people are going to laugh  And I understand that  I think I'm allergic to my Christmas tree 
[00:05:00]  I think I have finally figured this shit out  Because if you follow  What kind of Scrooge is allergic to a Christmas tree?  Well, I'm very allergic  I'm a very allergic boy  And you see  How many colds do you see a year for me?  It gets to the point you get frustrated  A lot  I understand  Just imagine living this way  Ow  I get a lot of fucking colds  And my allergist said  That it's not necessarily a cold  You could be allergic  And have an allergy attacks during the year  And I'm thinking  It's the middle of winter 
[00:05:30]  Pretty much right now  Yeah, what could I be allergic to?  And I'm like  Yeah, everything's  Dead  I mean, officially I'm allergic to all trees  There's no ragweed  Ragweed and grasses  There's no grass  Pollen  So I'm scratching my head  Like, why am I getting sick every Christmas?  Like, I get this heavy  Like, kind of cold and achy  And all that crap  And I'm staring at the goddamn Christmas tree  I'm thinking  I'm bringing in this poison to my own house  Maybe  The spores are coming off of it  And I was working  I was working the lights yesterday 
[00:06:00]  So you have to pull up this branch  And pull this branch down  And get your lights all set right  So I'm shaking up the shit  And I think I might be allergic to my Christmas tree  Did you have  Did you get sap on your hands?  Oh yeah, I get a little sap on my hands  I hate sap on my hands  Because it's sticky  Yeah, you don't like the sticky stuff  It's unwashable  Yeah  You can't wash off the sticky  Yeah  You need, like, Brillo  Brillo  Oh, I've used Brillo to get sap on my hands  You gotta get scalding hot water  And just fucking  Is that it? 
[00:06:30]  Like, just burn yourself  Oh, the sap will come off  Nice  Along with the first few layers of skin  Nah, you don't need the first few  It's when it gets a little deeper  When it really starts hurting  See, I gotta respect that, though  It's, uh  You get the real tree  Yeah  Yeah  See, I opted many years ago  But also for the size of it  It's a very large tree  Because of the high ceilings  But I like fake trees  Because  No muss, no fuss  Right  You don't have the needles all over the place  No needles, no sap  No fucking crawling under there to water it 
[00:07:00]  You feel like a car mechanic  You get on a crawler  Right  You slide under the tree  Just to water this fucking dead thing  Yeah  In your house  Yeah  And what you get in Manhattan  You have to go to these fucking tree whores  They're set up on every corner  I'm sure they're very fruity  And these tree whores give you a dry tree  Yeah  When you're shopping for a whore  You don't want something dry  No, you want moist  You want a nice, moist fucking tree  Moist, young, supple tree  I don't think one of my trees has made it to New Year's 
[00:07:30]  Still standing  Just  It becomes  It goes from a festive, Christmassy, celebratory thing in your room  To a fire hazard  Yes  That's all it is  Very quickly too  It's now just an unnecessary piece of tinder in my house  And everyone got  They have their tips on how to keep the tree alive longer  No  It's Manhattan  Put an aspirin in  Right  With the water  Great  The tree doesn't have a headache  But it's dry  Yeah, exactly  The tree's been sucking in exhaust here in Manhattan 
[00:08:00]  I don't think it's going to survive too long when you get it in your house  That's true too  So now I get my tree later and later  Oh, you do?  The guy swore to me that they just cut this one down  And brought it down from upstate a couple days ago  Really?  And I believe him because I'm not a naive New Yorker  Oh, of course  You know what they probably do?  They probably rotate the trees where the freshest ones are in the place that they're not  Selling  Like they put them somewhere  And they give everyone the dry tree so they have no loss in inventory  Right  So you're always getting the old tree  It's like the fruit man 
[00:08:30]  Yeah  Right?  You know what they do, right?  Yeah  The fresh fruit for the people out there that still haven't figured this out  I mean, you know when the deliveries come in your supermarket, right?  These fucking guys  I'm going to get it on video  The fresh fruit is at the bottom of the pile  Because it could last longer  Yep, that's what they do  They don't want to throw fruit away  Rotate the stock  So you see a big pile of blueberries or strawberries  You're picking what's right on top  Because you're like, oh, the fruit man's here  And here's all the fresh fruit  Hell fucking no  They bury that shit 
[00:09:00]  They want it to last as long as possible  And I bet they're doing the same thing with the Christmas trees  Tastes as cantaloupe  So the new fucking Christmas tree  Papaya  Is that a Seinfeld?  That's Seinfeld  I didn't know that one  Christmas trees, same thing  I bet you they're buried  The fresh ones  Yep  All the nice ones  Sappy ones  So my theory is  I think I'm allergic to the Christmas tree  Because I get this dumb, weird, cold  Every fucking Christmas  Do they cut the bottom of your tree properly?  I don't know  Or is it leaning?  Oh, no, it's straight up  Straight up  See, that's another thing I was always 
[00:09:30]  It doesn't look like Brett Favre's cock, no  Oh, good  Good  You don't want that  That twisty, leany, short tree  No, mine looks like a heater  It doesn't have problems like Brett Favre's cock  That's one of my great Christmas memories  When Dad was living with us  Yeah  Yeah, it was the Christmas tree  Getting of the Christmas tree  Which was just a yelling match  Because Dad was cold and he didn't want to be there  Did he ever not yell?  He wanted to be at the bar  No  This is picking out a Christmas tree  Who yells when they're getting a Christmas tree? 
[00:10:00]  It was just him and my mother  Couldn't see eye to eye on anything  Even on what Christmas tree to pick out?  No  Never  Because, like, I think my mother wanted the scotch pine  Yeah  And my father wanted the other type  Douglas fir  Douglas fir, exactly  Dad was a Douglas fir guy  Kenny's enjoying the Christmas stories we're telling  Mom was a scotch pine  Yeah  And scotch pines are the ones that are like  Really, they got the fuzzy  They're almost fuzzy like the tree  And Dad was like  You can't even get lights on that, Ro 
[00:10:30]  What are you talking about?  Why don't you just go with the kids?  I'll get the tree  He's always yelling  What backroom deal did he make for his tree?  Oh, God only knows what he was fucking  He's paying for the tree with the change he robbed from the vending machine company he worked for  Your dad was into bartering, I bet  Oh, God  Was he a barterer?  Anytime  My dad was for a while  Anytime  My dad was trading goods like it was the early 1800s  Like he's in fucking Bangladesh 
[00:11:00]  Yeah  Like a marketplace  He's got some molasses that he's trading for the Christmas tree  I don't know how he figured that shit out  Back to your story  My father would  He'd pay for shit with change that he stole from the vending machines  That he was supposed to be refilling and collecting money for  Right  And he'd get the tree home  And then have to take this old rusted saw  And try to cut the tree straight  You just brought back a memory  What was that?  The wah-wah-wah saw  Yeah, yeah  Wah-wah-wah-wah  A regular fucking 
[00:11:30]  That's just a regular saw  Yeah  Cross-cut saw  Whatever it is  Yeah  And he never got it straight  And he'd be like  Fire a cigarette hanging out of his mouth  The drink clanging  Clink clank  Scotch on the table  Fuck  Fucking tree  And then he'd have to take another little bit off  And my mother's just taunting him  Not realizing she's fucking messing with the beast  Joey, cut it straight  It's good enough  It's not good enough, Ro  You want a tilted tree?  Then I'll put it up now  And we'll have a tilted tree 
[00:12:00]  You can adjust the stand, you know  That's what I do  See, exactly  People do that, right?  But my father didn't want to hear it  He wanted to get that thing cut at a perfect 90 degree angle  Sure  And then he put it up  And there was always some real guinea fucking top on the tree  Like, I like a nice little top on the tree and stuff  But we had this guinea fucking angel  The thing had to be three fucking or two feet in diameter  Wow 
[00:12:30]  Where it was this like  Almost like a shell kind of a background  With Mary holding fucking Jesus in the middle  And it had this rotating light thing that sparkled  It was horrible  And him putting the lights up were another thing  He just, never enough lights  They never worked  He's trying to plug them in  And then, oh, goddamn fucking lights  They never  And then he's got to change every bulb  To make sure 
[00:13:00]  Because you know how lights work  Used to  Yeah, used to work  Thank God  Now, you know, they still work  If a light bulb goes out for the most part  But it was just  I just remember a lot of yelling  There was some joy  On Christmas morning  When we finally woke up  But if we woke up too early  There wasn't joy  Really?  And as a kid  Five in the morning for Christmas morning  Isn't too early  That's sleeping in  That's fucking like  Because you're up  And the second you see like  The sky giving that dark bluish color  Which means like daytime 
[00:13:30]  You're up  And then I'd hear from the room  Like from their room  Like  Back to bed  Because we'd be out  Looking at the presents  Like I wonder what that is  Ready to dig in  You weren't allowed to open them?  No  My parents got to the point where  Ah  If you wake up early  Go for it  No, because he wanted to fucking  We'll join you later  He wanted to film the joy  Oh really?  Yeah  Thank God  And not thank God  I wish there was sound on the camera  Because it was one of those  Eight millimeter film cameras  Why aren't you posting that?  You've got to post that shit  I have a lot of  Eight millimeter videos 
[00:14:00]  You've got to post that  Yeah, yeah  I will  I'll go through it  I even have it on my computer  So it's easy enough  To just rip off and put it on there  Oh, you've got to post a couple clips  I wish we had that stuff  Yeah, there's me  Dressed like young Vito Corleone  I don't know why my mother would dress  Dress me like Vito  When he first got to Ellis Island  I had the little guinea hat on  Sure, yeah  And the little suit  It was just  You had to dress up  To open up Christmas presents?  Well, afterwards  We were in our Christmas jammies  The red and white stripes  With the little hat 
[00:14:30]  And the feeties  And the Christmas hats?  Yeah, we had like  Those old type  You know, Ebeneezer Scrooge hats  You all had one?  Yeah, yeah  We had one  I might hand those out  To the in-laws this year  Because we do Christmas in Philly  Yeah, make everyone wear  Ebeneezer Scrooge hat  And then we used to have to do  How awkward would that be?  We used to have to do this thing  Tough Philly guys with their fucking  Sorry, go ahead  No, we did this thing where  I guess my father knew  He wasn't going to be up  When we got up  When we got up  Because of the hangover, I guess  But  So we'd have to go like 
[00:15:00]  Alright, it's Christmas  It's the night before Christmas  Go to bed  And  He'd like film us  Getting into bed  With our little  Our little Christmas jammies on  And make believe  We were asleep  And I'm laying there  With my eyes shut real tight  Because my acting abilities  Are very poor  You couldn't make believe  Too well, huh?  I couldn't make believe  And I had  I had my little hands  On the blanket  Under my chin  And my eyes are shut real tight  And then he'd be like  Alright  And it's Christmas morning  And I'd open my eyes 
[00:15:30]  And sit up  With this dumb looking  Like face  And  And the light  On the camera  Was like a thousand watts  Yeah  Because it was a shitty camera  You know, in the old days  And I'm squinting  And trying to wave  At the camera  And my brother's there  Doing the same thing  You gotta post it  I know  I didn't even think about that  But yeah, that is  So you guys  No, dad never filmed  The beatings  Which would have been good  Filming the beatings  Would have been good  Yeah, but at least  At least there was some peace 
[00:16:00]  For a little while  Yeah, then Christmas morning  Was very nice  It was just opening up  Presents and stuff  But then I was always  A nervous crying Nelly  Like I was with  And I have a film of this  Me and my brother  Playing guitar and drums  And I was playing  You know, a little Beatles  Drum set  My brother's playing his guitar  And he's rocking  You guys wanted to be  The Osmonds  Well, no, it was the Beatles  You were trying Beatles  Yeah, yeah  It was Beatles back then  And my drum kit  Kept moving forward  It kept sliding forward  When I hit the bass pedal  It was one of those  Little paper fucking drum sets 
[00:16:30]  I think it was  The Monkees drum set  Or something  And it kept sliding forward  And I just burst into tears  I'm crying  Going like  It's moving forward  And then my dad's just yelling  Just get out and play  Oh, really?

[00:24:00]  I said Sam  Please  He was one of my favorites of all time  As far as these guys coming and going  Of course intern David wouldn't  Respond to phone calls or emails  He's just decided  He just ditched us  He decided not to respond yesterday  He's a weirdo  I don't need them  Alright  Let's take our first break  When we get back  We have to discuss the Christmas cookies  That are sitting in front of us  Smells good in here  It really does look wonderful  These cookies  Where were these bought? 
[00:24:30]  Purchased?  No no no no  I thought so  Of course  And they're all perfect  From scratch  They are perfect  They're perfect  I tweeted one picture so far  But I think I have to tweet one  With the wrapping off  So you can see how perfect  These fucking cookies are  Fucking Stepford mother you got  I've never wanted to  Jesus  Dance on a dessert before  Well maybe once  I earned that dessert  To the assholes that are still  Killing me over that video  The stupid cake was  Fucking stale  And the guy walked away 
[00:25:00]  With a lot of  God damn cash  That I didn't want to  Pull out of my pocket  So enough already  Enough already  He did earn that cake  And also  They're saying it's an  Instant classic  We got a brand new  Christmas song for everybody  Yes  They're calling it  An instant classic  Instant classic  I agree  That's a bold statement  And Iraq you got something  For the holiday  As we go to break  One minute or thumbs up  What was that  Oh boy  No I'm all good  Alright hit it  This is the OPNN3 show  We got to get into these  Christmas cookies 
[00:25:30]  Gary Howie  How Howie  It's a How How Howie Christmas  How How Howie  Whatever happened to that guy  After he  Fucking pilfered the place  Not Gary Howie  The um  The guy that introduced us  To How How Howie  We're window cling  I do believe that guy  Pilfered the place  That we used to work at  Gold records on the wall  Went and  Recordings  I think he has  A fine collection  Satellite dishes  That the Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame would love 
[00:26:00]  Oh yeah and Best Buy  Would love half their shit back  I don't know for sure  But he's very suspicious  Ah  So we got Christmas cookies  In front of us  We came into work today  And um  Not that this is work  We understand that sir  And Sam very excited  He presents gifts  Like we were like baby Jesus  Or something  Yes 
[00:26:30]  He brought some incense  Or some frankincense  And myrrh  And myrrh and gold  Is it myrrh or myrrh  Well myrrh he brings on a daily basis  He certainly does  He brings myrrh on a daily basis  But the gifts that he brought  Were like the gift of the magi  Yeah  You uh  You did  You came in presenting  What was amazing  Um  Treats  Cookies and what not  And fudge thingies  Wrapped up  And not on some 
[00:27:00]  Shitty paper plate or anything  No  These are  These are dishes  Platters  That he's gonna have to take home  Right  Because his mommy made these  His mommy made  Christmas cookies from scratch  And I  I challenge anyone  To  They wouldn't  Wouldn't be able to tell  The difference between this  And cookies you would buy  In a really nice store  Some of that gourmet shit  Yeah they look like gourmet  Christmas cookies  Yes  There's no fucking way  She made them from scratch  But I know Bobby  And I  I will guarantee  That these were made from scratch 
[00:27:30]  She's probably started  Around Thanksgiving  Right  You see the  On the pecan tarts there  They're like tiny little pecan pies  Yeah  You see the crust  Yeah  That  The crust is from scratch  Like it's not like  She buys shells  And then makes the pecan  The crust  Everything we're looking at  Is from scratch  Right  Why don't you  Why don't you name  The cookies we got here  Because I'm sure  You've been eating these  Your entire life  What's some of them  Cookies we got here  Chocolate chip  Love  I see the chocolate chip  The chocolate chip  Is her specialty 
[00:28:00]  For Christmas this year  She made them a little smaller  That's just something  Why are they her specialty  That's her thing  The chocolate chip cookies  Well fucking let's try one man  I mean help yourself  It's there for you  The watch is keeping me  From getting some  Yeah  Watch out for the arsenic ant  Smells good  Let me try the  Wow  Jesus Christ  She could freaking sell these  I know  Mmm  Delicious  So it's the chocolate chip cookies  Oh wait a minute  A Sam hair is in it  There's no hair 
[00:28:30]  She bakes them with Sam's hair  Oh my god  The cookies contain Sam's hair  It's Sam's hair  Damn you  And then there's  The traditional Christmas cookies  Made in the shapes of like  A Christmas tree  Or a star  Or something like that  Or her beloved Sam  Or yes  The Sam cookie  There's the pecan tarts  Which is like a very  Small bite sized pecan pie  Yeah  There are  I think that's like a 
[00:29:00]  What's like a  Coconut truffle type thing  She made homemade coconut truffles  That's what it looks like  She's out of her mind  She really is  Then there's the fudge  With no nuts  Because I don't like nuts and fudge  Of course you don't  So there's the fudge with no nuts  Then there's the fudge with nuts  Right  And then there's the  I think that's like a  Either a white chocolate  Or maybe a maple fudge  With walnuts  On top  Yeah  She made so many things  That looks like a  Maple walnut fudge  If I know my fudges 
[00:29:30]  Yeah that's what I think  And then on top of that  Anthony  There's some that are  Cut in half  Right  Because we might not  Have a knife  And we might want to  Just try a little bit  Of a cookie  Right  She thought of everything  And then they were  Wrapped up in some  Beautiful Christmasy  Cellophane  Cellophane  With ribbons  And bows  Hand tied  Hand tied  Not bought at a store  And slapped on  With a little sticky thing  And Sam brought them in  Presenting them  With his wonderful  Christmassy  Flannel  Red shirt 
[00:30:00]  Just wonderful  Oh that was calculated too?  Yes it was  I thought about that this morning  Oh you wore a Christmas shirt  To deliver the Christmas cookies  Very festive  You fucking faggot  I had to yell at her too  Because she wanted me  To bring Christmas napkins  And I said we work in a place  With like a kitchen  And everything  We have napkins  But we don't have Christmas napkins  Why didn't you bring in  The Christmas napkins  You should have  I didn't want to  You should have  I would have felt better  Yeah Bobby  Bobby's probably  Really sad right now  She probably  She said okay  But she's probably  Really pissed off 
[00:30:30]  She wants everything  To be like just perfect  Because this is now  Just 95%  Right  She hasn't liked that  Napkins would have been  100%  And she's a 100% gal  Yeah  I mean she likes to make sure  Whatever she's doing  She's got to be  The best at it  She belongs  In 1955  With an apron on  Yeah  And a little bit of flour  In her hair  Because she's cooking  Everything from scratch  Oh yeah  And doesn't even mind  When dad comes home  And belts her in the eye  Because he's had  A few too much  To drink at the office 
[00:31:00]  Because they lost  A big account  The Johnson account  He lost the Johnson account  Yeah  And he punched her in the eye  And still with a smile  She serves dinner  Mashed potatoes  Serves dinner  She starts with serving  The cocktail to the man  Of course  First the cocktail  The shoes come off  The slippers go on  Pack his pipe  Give him his pipe  With you know  Her eye just swelling up  Right  Because of that  God damn Johnson account  Yeah  And the newspaper  Folded just right  Perfect  To the sports page  And you think 
[00:31:30]  We're exaggerating  Sam's father was a madman  Yeah  Yeah but he didn't  Punch her in the face  When he lost an account  You never know Sam  I mean I don't know  The signs are all there  No they're not  Yeah they are  They're certainly all there  He worked in advertising  He's trying to behave  It's obvious  Look at these  These things are perfect  I mean yeah  How does she make them  So perfect  She's a perfectionist  She likes to make sure  What she's doing  Is 100%  She likes to be better  Than anybody else  At whatever she's doing  But she'll never admit  How competitive  And how much she needs 
[00:32:00]  To be better than people  At what she's doing  Is your sister starting  To make her Christmas cookies  No my sister is not  My sister did not  Inherit the feminine  Qualities of my mother  Do you believe  What are you trying to say  Is she a lesbian  No she's not a lesbian  She's happily married  But she's not like  She's a tough one  She's not a Susie homemaker  Let's put it that way  No  Oh really  She's a working gal  She's a career lady  Is Jess learning  From this  She is  Jess isn't making 
[00:32:30]  Christmas cookies  Is she  No  Because that would be  World War 3  I want Jess to come over  For Christmas next year  With her own  Homemade cookies  And just watch  The fucking fireworks  Oh god  Then you're gonna see  What your mom's  Really made of  Call my mom and say  Look I'm gonna make dessert  So I'll bring it over  Oh my god  I knew it  She's trying to hone in  On my action  So Jess could never  Make Christmas cookies  Well I mean  Unless she learns  How to make them  That good  They're pretty good 
[00:33:00]  I would love to  Trash them but  Try a pecan tart  I'm not  I want the  I have to finish  My sandwich first  You want a  The coconut truffle thing  Here try something  Don't be shy  They're for you  Don't be shy  So fucking  Annoying  I hope our guests  Enjoy treats too  They certainly will  Enjoy them  Sam  Thank you  Let us have them though  Before they  Put their grubby  Fucking hands on them  Oh yeah  Is Bobby up  Listening to the radio 
[00:33:30]  To make sure we enjoy  Her Christmas cookies  She probably woke up  At 6 o'clock this morning  To see what you guys  Said about her  Is Bobby very sanitary  When she cooks  Very sanitary  Washing her hands a lot  Oh yeah  I just got a sad face  Text from Jess by the way  Why  Because you're engaged to her  Sorry  She just realized  Jess could never do  Any of these  Motherly things for you  No  She's got to do it  With the shades down  In your own home  Because if  If Bobby gets wind  That Jess is doing  Some of these  Motherly things 
[00:34:00]  There's going to be hell  Jess is more a yell at some guy  On a subway  Right  Kind of girl  Because nobody likes that  Right  And you do realize  Nobody likes that  You do realize  You guys are going to get married  You'll have children  You do realize  That your mom  Will be breastfeeding  Your own kid  Oh my god  That's ridiculous  You do realize  That is sick  Jess won't even be allowed  To breastfeed her own child  That is ridiculous  I mean  Is it  Is it ridiculous  Is it  Let's put that on the table  How ridiculous is that  She shaved your hair 
[00:34:30]  And baby teeth  Yeah but obviously  Jess doesn't have to  Mother me  That's not her job  But Jess will  Mother her child  You're sure though  Yes I'm positive  I'm going to ask Bobby  Get her on the phone  Oh no  Jess looks like a girl  That's got that  Wild streak in her  She don't want to  Settle down like that  You do realize  I mean she does  Have a temper  Fast forward five years  And your mom  And Jess  Don't get along at all  They'll be getting along  Just fine  Just for your sake  But believe me  Your mom  Just for your sake  Because she loves 
[00:35:00]  Her little Sammy  Yeah  Will tolerate her  And be like  Oh  Hi  Oh welcome  Yeah no come in  No it's so good to see  But  But  And that's just for you  But meanwhile  When you leave  Behind closed doors  She's telling pops  Things like  You know  I knew  I knew  When I first met her  And my dad's just like  Ignore  Okay whatever  Yeah whatever  But in all fairness to Jess  There's no girl  That is good enough  For Sam  My mom is very happy 
[00:35:30]  Bobby's eyes  Is no girl  Good enough  Jess rules  But that's not good enough  We all know Jess rules  But it's not about that  My mom is very happy  With Jess  Yeah  Yeah  And they get along  For now  Until you say I do  Can I make a quick  Quick off road thing here  Yes  They didn't fire that  Hot 97 DJ  And I applaud that radio company  I applaud those motherfuckers  Are they still reviewing  Was it Emmys  Are they  I believe Emmys communication  One of the main guys  Said we're not firing our DJ  He made a mistake 
[00:36:00]  He was trying to be funny  And that's that  Sorry but we're not firing our guy  He is an ethnic guy though  So  I understand  If he was a white guy  He'd be gone  But we gotta  We gotta start somewhere  At least they're not firing DJs  This guy made a joke  About how he doesn't have AIDS  Because he doesn't  He doesn't have sex  With Haitian women  And he got into a lot of  And he was going for the joke  And they're saying  It's not a joke  And they want the guy fired  And management over there  Said no  We're not firing the guy  Sorry  We've reprimanded him  And we told him  That's offensive to some people 
[00:36:30]  But we're not firing the guy  Yeah  And he did  Look I'll take it  In this business I'll take it  But you are right  If it was a white guy  He's so god  And he jumped in there  With a fucking apology  He did a waddle doodle  That was wow  Second to none  But the apology  Doesn't mean anything  No it doesn't  They were marching  Outside the station yesterday  The Haitians  And their  The Haitian leaders  Yeah  Yeah it's an ugly one  Why don't they  For once  A record  A radio company  Stood behind their guy  You know and I think  Haiti's got a few more  Problems right now  Than a DJ  Saying something goofy 
[00:37:00]  On the air  Maybe instead of  Marching in front  Of the radio station  They could go  And help out  With earthquake relief  In Haiti  Maybe that's a little  More important  Than some dumb  Fucking joke  That a DJ says  People are idiots  Absolutely  Are we getting Bobby  On the phone  I sent the number  Let's go to Alex  In Boston  Alex  Well well Alex  Alex  Morning guys  Love you  Love the show  Of course you do  Hey there was a  Guide to the good wife 
[00:37:30]  That was published  Supposedly  In Housekeeping Magazine  In like 1955  Or 1957  Yeah I keep that  Around the house  It's reference material  Can you look that up  We've done the bit  In the past  But this was  This was some serious  This was a real article  Oh yeah  Back in  Yeah I think you might be right  1957 somewhere around there  When women knew  How to be women  And how a housewife  Was supposed to act  And there's no jokes here  This was really  A serious article  I love this one  Thank you sir  Thank you  Have dinner ready 
[00:38:00]  Plan ahead  Even the night before  To have  Can we have some  1957  Oh yeah that would be nice  Not too loud either  I know we only have  Two members  Helping us out today  Yeah  But you know  I guess Iraq can't multitask  He's not good  Iraq's not in there  Really  But that's right  We got a phone screen  Full ball kicker  Was in here  I bet  It'd be getting played  Iraq's chatting it up  With my mom  Whoa  I let that one slip  Holy shit  I didn't know  That was his new nickname  Wow what are you me 
[00:38:30]  What's wrong with you  It's such an inside joke  At this point  As we wait for the  1957 music  I'm gonna off road again  People that are in  The Spider-Man musical  Are now saying  Please cancel this  Before someone gets killed  The Spider-Man musical  Could be  The biggest debacle  Ever in entertainment  Yeah  And I'm saying  Worse than Ishtar  And stuff like that  If you really  This could be  One of the biggest 
[00:39:00]  Well  Miscalculations  Here you go  In entertainment history  The cost  65 million dollars  We've been talking  Locally this has been  A big story for a while  But now the rest of the  Country is getting involved  Yeah  The musical cost  65 million to  You know  Produce  The most expensive  Broadway show in history  And they just can't  Open this fucking thing  Because they got  Problem after problem  After problem  With of course  The guy falling  The other day  And almost dying  And that's 65 million  Not including the lawsuits  That are gonna  Pop up from these  Injured fucking people 
[00:39:30]  This guy's in serious  Condition too  Internal bleeding  Broken ribs  Yeah he's not  Like 30 feet  Yeah he's not  In good shape  And somebody else  That's involved  With this thing  The headline today  Is please cancel  The show before  Someone gets killed  Someone will get  Killed on this show  There's just too much  Shit going on  That I don't think  Broadway  Is ready to use  And has knowledge of  Like maybe the movie  Industry  And I know that  Broadway has 
[00:40:00]  Certain unions  That are supposed  To run everything  Right  And I don't think  They're used to  Things like this  It's just a speculation  On my part  But this is a very  Technical thing  Right  A lot of pulleys  And fucking  Motors and rigging  And all kinds of shit  Going on  That I think  They just went  Yeah I think  We can pull this off  And the whole musical  It's a backing  The whole musical  Is up in the air  Right  Yeah yeah  Why don't they get  The circus  Cirque du Soleil  Cirque right  Ah  They get those guys  They know how to  Do shit in the air 
[00:40:30]  They certainly do  The musical lyrics  By Bono and the Edge  Originally scheduled  Opening night  February 18th  2010  Currently scheduled  Opening night  February 7th  They've been in preview  Since November 28th  That's crazy  Yeah  You know you do  Previews for a week or two  Just to kind of  You know see what you want  To change  They knew this was  Going to be a problem  And at this point  Number of actors  Injured  Four  Four injured  Four injured so far  And it doesn't  Start in really bad shape  Doesn't open until February  Right  And they're already 
[00:41:00]  Hearing from backers  That want to pull out now  So someone begging  That they just cancel  The whole thing  Because someone  Before someone dies  They're not going to  Cancel it  Because they invested  Way too much money  In this thing  Too much money  They want some  Of their money back  If a few people  Got to die  For the good of  You know  A Broadway show  Or entertainment  Sure  Then why not  And it is Spider-Man  Let's say hi to Bobby  Bobby  Of course  Sam's mom  Bobby  The wonderful  Lovely Bobby  We're enjoying  The Christmas cookies  Ma'am  Hey good  I'm glad  That's what they're for  They're so good

Well  I don't know  I just  The natural talent  I don't know  No I guess  I just observe  Some people are good at math  Other people can make  Great cookies  And treats  Yeah  For Christmas  Hey Bobby  Your husband doesn't  Hit you right?  Not often  He loses the Johnson account  We know how that is  God damn Johnson

[00:42:30]  But I'm just one guy  I'm just one guy  I know it's your specialty  Normally they would be  Because I actually  Baked these  Last  Like yesterday afternoon  About 5 o'clock  Normally  I only give them away  The day I bake them  Ah  Oh you got  She's got rules  For her cookies  Yes  But she had to find out  What time I was coming over  To pick them up  So she could put them  In the oven  At the last possible minute  Last second  Bobby why so lazy  You should have been up  All night cooking them  And then Sam stops by 
[00:43:00]  Yeah 3.30  3.30 in the morning  So lazy  And then I get a nice  Warm moist chocolate chip cookie  Why do I have to suffer  Because you want  A good night's sleep  I love that about you guys  You really don't ask  For too much  No not at all  We really don't  Could you pass me  Some of the nutless fudge  I don't like nuts  You don't like nuts  In my fudge  I know Sam doesn't  Sam doesn't like those nuts  That's why I started  Making some of it  Yes yes  So the whole family  Has to suffer  Because Sam doesn't 
[00:43:30]  Like nuts  You hear this  You hear this  There's another one  That's exactly the same  Except it has nuts in it  We make both  So everybody's satisfied  How about you make them  All with nuts  And tell Sam  To get over his nut thing  No no no  This is perfect  Oh you like it  Without the nuts in  This is insane good  Yeah  What do you do  For your fudge  You gotta send me  The recipe  My fucking chest hurts  I'm just glad  You guys are enjoying it  What's up with  The coconut ball 
[00:44:00]  Truffle  Yeah what's  Underneath those things  Yeah  That's really a favorite  Because that's  That's bittersweet chocolate  With rum and coconut  Is it uh  Bittersweet  It's like working here  It's very good  Is it dark chocolate  It is yes  Oh  Oh  I like the dark chocolate  It's the only dark chocolate  I like  Oh I see  And you know what  If you put those things  In the fridge  I like Sam's mom  Who obviously likes  The fucking chocolate  Look at Sam  The rum is like

[00:45:00]  Oh  That's for Sam's dad  He's really the pecan guy  Of course he is  Because he comes  From another time  Although there's  Plenty of wonderful  Choices here  I don't want to  You know  So much  Yeah  It's tough to trash  This one Bobby  This is just amazing  Oh well I'm glad  You know I'm  I'm always looking  For things you guys  Can't trash  Now Bobby  A couple things  Yeah  Now obviously Sam  Is going to marry Jess  And you're very happy  About that  Everyone is  I know the whole family is  And we're very happy  For Sam as well 
[00:45:30]  Everyone is  We'll break character  For a second  But if Jess  Comes over with  Her own version  Of the Christmas  Cookie platter  That would be a problem  Right  See you hear the laugh  Yeah  That would be a problem  That laugh was considered  Diabolical  That would not be a problem  It would be though right  Jess has actually  Brought cookies over  Before that she  Baked herself  Oh really  Oh you know what  For my birthday  This past year  She baked her  Very first cake 
[00:46:00]  From scratch  Wow  Really  And now  She baked a cake  For her  When you threw it away  Did you cover it  With other garbage  So she wouldn't see it  Because that's usually  What you gotta do  If you throw something  Away that someone  Made for you  You cover it up  With like some  Paper towels  It was delicious  We did not throw it away  Oh  You didn't do what I did  To E-Rock's  Superbowl  Sam you want to  Retell that story  Real quickly  So your mom  Can appreciate it 
[00:46:30]  That was when  There was the  Staff Superbowl  Party  Were you there for it  No but I remember  The story well  Why weren't you there  You were just an intern  I was just a little guy  I don't think you liked  Talking to him yet  Yeah you didn't like me  I didn't like it at first  Well I mean you didn't  Know me  It probably reminded me  Of myself too much  And I was just like  At first glance  You're not likable  I've always thought I was  No  How about now  Yeah  You're a good guy  Hey uh  So  Go ahead E-Rock  Oh mouthful of cookie  Of course it is  No supplies there  Oh god 
[00:47:00]  These are delicious  Why would this hour  Be any different  These are delicious  Just put that in front  Of anything  Yeah so I had  So you had a Superbowl  Party  Invited everybody over  And uh  I brought  We all sat on one  Lame dirty old couch  In your mouse infested  Apartment  Ah that was in the apartment  With the cockroaches  Oh the old school place  It was a very small space  And uh  You know I brought  A cooler full of  Food and beer  And uh  While I was 
[00:47:30]  Setting up the wings  And everyone else  Had to fend for themselves  I shared  What are you guys having  So I cooked the wings  And then I put them out  Um  On his counter there  And he was faking  The fact that he was  Enjoying the  Like he was ripping them  Apart and throwing it  Into the garbage  So it looks like  It was eaten  He's like  No these are good  No the  But the beauty  Of the story is  You would have  Never known  And me and my girl  Decided to like  Take out half the tray  And put it in the garbage  So it looks like  People were eating 
[00:48:00]  People were eating them  And that's all  You would have known  That like  Oh they enjoyed my wings  But then I had to  Get on the air  The next day  To tell everybody  What I did  You didn't tell him  No  Until it was on the air  The next day  Oh no he left thinking  People enjoyed the food  Why weren't people  Eating the wings  I don't remember anymore  Because he wanted to be a dick  And said let's just  Throw them out  Oh  I don't remember  People weren't  Dinging the wings  That didn't taste good  So I had to make sure  No one had any  You told everyone  To throw them out  And not touch them  So how would you know  I probably did that  I brought wings 
[00:48:30]  It was awesome  Iroch has a mouthful  Of pecan tart right now  This one's even better  Are you digging that  Yeah  What one is that  The pecan tart  Oh okay  Isn't that correct  She makes so many  Different things  I can't see you guys  Eating that  So are you actually  Dropping it in the trash  No Bobby  It really is too good  Waste nuts  Waste nuts  There's not much  I can say on this one  This is just an amazing  Display of cookies  And mom  If they weren't

[00:55:30]  That goes over the front  Of her face  I love that old stuff  What does the old man  Do for Christmas  Does he do anything  He does  Oh yeah  Lots of stuff  He does lots of decorating  And he always builds  The fire for Christmas day  In the fireplace  He should start in a bedroom  I have a feeling  And I swear  I don't know the answer  To this  Does your dad  Do any type of readings  For Christmas  Or I was thinking  Singings  Of singing 
[00:56:00]  Or  Or  I think there's a family tradition  I'm getting a feeling  That your dad  Every year  There's something he does  Whether he leads everyone  In some Christmas carols  Mom do you want to tell him  Yeah did Sam  Did Sam tell you guys  About this  Nope  Maybe he did  And I'm just  Sammy do you want to tell him  Yeah well every year  For the last  Now it'll be  28 years  Oh no  Or 27 years  Um  My dad has read  The Night Before Christmas 
[00:56:30]  The Grinch Who Stole Christmas  The Polar Express  Holy shit  And then the actual  Bible  Story of Christmas  To all of the kids  How long does this take  It's like half an hour  Wow  Doesn't like my reads  Very fast  Another story  Here comes another story  Sponsored by  Wow  He really does that  Now does he wear  One of those Christmas hats  No  Like Ebeneezer Scrooge 
[00:57:00]  Or something like that  But he's got that  Handlebar mustache  Which really fits it  Now  By the children  Who do you mean the children  Are these just abductees  Sam you're pushing 30  You realize that  My 27 year old self  My 25 year old brother  The children  And my 30 year old sister  The children  Can I ask one question about this  Does your dad get kind of a pep in his step  When he knows it's almost time for the readings  Like okay  Gather round  Gather round 
[00:57:30]  Does he get himself a nice little Christmas cocktail  Like is there a whole thing that happens  It is his thing  He pokes the fire  Make sure the fire is just right  And by the way  You know  You talk about the Scrooge hat  He doesn't sleep in the hat  But on Christmas morning  Since that usually is a winter night  Yeah  Don't be surprised to see the man nightgown  Wait  The one  Your dad wears a man's nightgown  He has been known  That big long nightie  That you wear on Christmas  If you're  Like in 1920  In the winters  He has been known to wear a man nightgown 
[00:58:00]  Does he have underpants on at least  I haven't checked  You would know  That's like the shit  That the literal rascals wore  When they were in the orphanage  Yeah  But it's nice  Like made a flannel  Like from L.L. Bean or something  Oh  Bobby don't be confused by the way  We think this is all terrific  Me and Anna  Very uncomfortable  When it comes to  Normal family situations  Okay  Morning mashup  Is just coming in  To take more stuff  Hey we're going to build for some more  Hey man  Plundering your cookies  Fuck  Leave our cookies alone  Now is there music playing in the background 
[00:58:30]  When the stories are being told  Yeah  No but on Christmas morning  It should be a bed  Come on  You're on radio  It should be a bed  It should have a bed  On Christmas morning  My mom always puts on  John Denver and the Muppets Christmas CD  Oh that's a great one  I love that song  What's the one where  He crashes his plane  Into a mountain  What is that one  Or the ocean  That's what happened to him  That's not his  Oh I thought it was a Christmas song  I'm sorry  It's called  I'm not coming home for Christmas  Right  John Denver  I'll be fish food for Christmas  Something like that  I get confused 
[00:59:00]  That's not cool  My mom's a big John Denver fan  Well  Yes I am  Let's get Bob  You look like John Denver  Who me  No she's got  John Denver glasses sometimes  She doesn't look like John Denver  Oh no  Does she got the round glasses  I mean she wears glasses  Not John Denver glasses  Bobby the only reason I said that  Is because you wear glasses  You don't look like John Denver at all  Okay  It'd be Bob Denver  That was a big time stretch  Bobby's a  He doesn't have curly hair  Bobby's a very  Very good looking woman 
[00:59:30]  Now it's getting weird too  She's extremely good looking  Oh it is getting weird  That's getting weird  Why  I'm just  Call her a handsome woman  Yeah  Handsome  She just wanted to hear handsome  That has no undertones to it  It's a compliment  Yet it's not very  You know  You don't put her in this  Weird awkward  Sexual kind of place  That's the last thing you want  Beautiful is a good word  I want to say sexy  I let all the undertones  Just slide right by  I don't even notice  Oh my god  Thank goodness 
[01:00:00]  Bobby  I bet you do  Bobby here's the headline  I don't know  Bobby here's the headline  We're going to take out Martha Stewart  Yeah I think you can do it  There's a new gal in town  Yep  And she bakes a mean Christmas cookie  That's the headline  Yeah I hope Martha's listening  And that she's  Fuck Martha  Oh jeez language  Language  She doesn't like hearing that  She's going to wash your mouth out with soap  Yeah but this isn't  That's what they did back then  Bobby you got to learn  You got to learn from being an aunt  This is not a nice little war  This is going to get ugly 
[01:00:30]  I can do that  You can  I know you can  I grew up in an inner suburb of Detroit  Yeah  She used to have holes in her shoes  Aww  That's terrible  She wore plastic bags on her feet  Aww  Really?  No they were a little  No foot fetish videos for your mom  No  I wore plastic bags on her feet  Wow that's sad  Hey I did that in the winter  You just reminded me of something  Wonder Bread bags  Yeah I did that in winter  You did that too  Wonder Bread bags  A little rubber band to hold them up  And then you put your socks over them 
[01:01:00]  You put socks under them  And it keeps  It's like a  It was amazing right  It keeps your feet from getting wet  Although your feet would get a lot of fungus on it  Because it was like a greenhouse effect  Perhaps if you'd washed them  Yeah but it was a greenhouse effect  Yeah it really was  None of the moisture could escape either  Bobby I'm sure you didn't give your kids  Wonder Bread bags  In the middle of winter  No didn't do that  You were able to afford  She baked her own bread  Of course we know why  She probably knitted her own fucking boots for her kids 
[01:01:30]  Everything  She does everything from scratch  She's friggin  She's the Ingalls mom  She's going out to the river later on  Cracking the ice and washing their clothes  Let's get rid of Bobby  Yeah Bobby you  I think we've pushed as far as we can  Have a very Merry Christmas  Thank you  And thank you so much for your holiday treats  You're very welcome  You guys have a wonderful holiday  And I want to thank you for all the things you're teaching Sam  Oh wow really

[01:02:30]  Yeah  Yeah  You break a tooth  Yeah  Yeah  Oh  Oh  Certainly JD in New York City  Can I hear E-Rock  I want to know  I want to see if he pays attention  My favorite Christmas song of all time  I did this bit last year  My favorite Christmas song of all time  Roland is pretending to throw cum on E-Rock  Hallelujah  It's 10 o'clock  Hallelujah  That's my favorite Christmas song  Phone it in  Alright can we get the monsters in next 
[01:03:00]  Ah yes  Yes we could  Actually I like to think of it as our little Christmas gathering  Whereas during the year these people do take a lot of abuse from us  A lot of hits  And I think bringing them in  We have the spirit of Christmas  And we treat them a little better today  They're not getting any treats though  Because I'm saving those  No fuck them  Yeah Vinny from the Jersey Shore  Is not going to be sharing with them  So they won't get any of those  You want Vinny from the Jersey Shore to get some  Oh yeah very much

[01:06:00]  Of all  With those holiday greetings  And gay happy meetings  When friends come to call  It's the half-happiest season  Of all  There'll be parties for hosting  Marshmallows for toasting  And caroling out in the snow  There'll be scary ghost stories  And tales of the glories 
[01:06:30]  Of Christmases long, long ago  It's the most wonderful time  Of the year  There'll be much mistletoeing  And hearts will be glowing  When loved ones are near  It's the most wonderful time  Of the year  There'll be scary ghost stories 
[01:07:00]  And tales of the glories  Of Christmases long, long ago  It's the most wonderful time  Of the year  There'll be much mistletoeing 
[01:07:30]  And hearts will be glowing  When loved ones are near  It's the most wonderful time  Yes, the most wonderful time  For the most wonderful time  Of the year  This is the virus 
[01:08:00]  Sirius XM  You better watch out  You better not cry  You're gonna go dry  I'm telling you why  Santa's whore is coming  To town  She's making a fist  Stroking it twice  Grabbing your balls  And checking for lice 
[01:08:30]  Santa's whore is coming  To town  Well, she blows you  And it's flassy  She humps you  And it's stiff  She don't care  If you're fat or good  She'll make you  Take a whiff  Oh, you better watch out  You sit on your face  When your cock's right out  You put your thumb  And it's a place  Santa's whore is coming  Santa's whore is coming  Santa's whore is coming 
[01:09:00]  To town  Oh, you better watch out  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Yeah, yeah, yeah  You better watch out  Opie and Anthony  Show on the virus  Sirius XM  Seriously?  What the hell just happened there?  Why did you have to do that, Iraq?  You nagled it, buddy  That was so nagled right there  What the hell did I do?  You nagle that word. 
[01:09:30]  Did you hear Opie kind of backsold the John Valvey thing,  talking about how, you know, hey, it's getting into the Christmas spirit.  And right in the middle of talking, you just fucking hit a sweeper and then hit this music.  I had it from there.  We didn't have to do what we do every fucking time and play a sweeper.  Because there was music that was being played, so you didn't have to go to a sweeper in music.  And, you know, sometimes he's talking.  Sometimes we do it a little differently.  I don't have your studio on until that sweeper hits. 
[01:10:00]  Why?  Because usually we play stuff to extend the break a little more or whatever you're doing.  So you didn't hear what I was saying?  No.  So you don't know if we're saying anything?  You just automatically hit sweepers and shit?  The audience didn't hear you until the rejoining music turned on.  Oh.  That's weird.  That's how we've always done it.  Yeah, but it sounds different when I'm talking.  I don't like that because what if we want to talk right after something?  Yeah.  They don't get to hear it?  We'll be fixing that in the new year.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  So this makes no sense because they didn't hear we talk to begin with? 
[01:10:30]  No.  I thought it was a nagelization.  That's weird.  Well, it was.  All right.  Hey.  I thought that break was nagelified at the end.  Really?  Oh, shit.  Really?  Really?  Really now?  Hey, Little Fuckers is getting a half a star in one of the New York papers.  Fuckers.  Little Fuckers.  It's Fockers.  We know what the joke is.  All right?  Yeah, we don't play along with their games.  To say Fockers is like, oh, I get it.  Right.  We wanted to say Fuckers, but we couldn't, so this is the closest we can get. 
[01:11:00]  Can I have that other paper, please?  Which one?  I got that one.  I need that one.  With the New York Post?  Yes.  There you go.  They're giving it a half a star, I believe.  Half a star?  For Little Fuckers.  That's got to be good.  Because I know a lot of people.  The less stars, the better, right?  Is that how it works?  Yeah, I think so.  And their headline is, shut the fuckers up.  Fuckers.  Fuckers.  What?  Shut the fuckers up.  Shut the fuckers up.  It says it right there.  It's Fockers.  And Silly Fuckers right on the front page of the paper today.  Silly Fuckers. 
[01:11:30]  Yes.  Wow.  What the fuck is wrong with people?  Rotetomatoes.com.  8% positive reviews from all the reviewers across America.  8%.  Most reviewers hate this fucking movie.  And 78% of the people going to see it so far like the movie.  I thought it was so funny.  Did you see the part where he called him, like, the Godfucker?  No.  Is that in there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Robert De Niro actually sells out. 
[01:12:00]  You shouldn't say I'm a Godfucker, though.  Godfucker is bad.  Don't say that.  That's really bad.  Sacrilegious.  No, we're not playing their games.  Sacrilegious.  I told you that already.  Stick a fuck in it.  Stick a fuck in it.  Little fuckers, half a star.  Shut the fuckers up.  Yeah, they're not liking this one.  What are some of the other reviews on Rotten Tomatoes there?  Any clever ones?  Well, the one positive review just says, I did not find little fuckers to be particularly excruciating. 
[01:12:30]  Indeed, I laughed pretty hard several times.  So it's like saying...  So it's not excruciating.  And that's a positive review.  That's positive.  But the people gave it 78% positive.  The people that go to the...  The morons out there will never surprise me.  I understand the movie reviewer is a little too cool for the room.  But still, to have 8% positive reviews from the reviewers and 78% positive reviews from the people seeing the movie, that doesn't make sense. 
[01:13:00]  There's a problem there.  Did you see when he does the thing, like he points at his eyes and then points at...  And then...  Shut up.  Who cares?  I loved Meet the Parents.  I really liked that one.  The first one was funny.  And I don't really remember the second one at all.  I know I saw it.  No.  And this one I will watch when it's handed to me in a couple weeks.  I don't even think I'll do that.  I'll check it out at least.  For the goof! 
[01:13:30]  Don't even think I'll do that.  All right.  Well, Rex Ryan and his wife...  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  Yeah, I want to know what this is all about.  Rex, wife, look-alike, and fetish video.  It says look-alike, but...  Now, that's foot-ball.  Get it?  Foot-fetish.  Yeah.  Wife-look-alike vid has Rex in a toe jam.  Ah, I get it.  A lot of foot jokes.  A lot of foot jokes.  What's this about, Ant?  Well, it seems that they were making some kind of video with Rex Ryan's wife 
[01:14:00]  hanging her feet out of an SUV, kind of a window, and he was videotaping...  Or this is what people are alleging.  And he's videotaping it, making comments that sound just like him.  Right.  And it looks exactly like his wife.  And the kind of bio that's behind these people  is exactly what the bio is for Rex Ryan and his wife.  Why would they have, like, that info out there? 
[01:14:30]  I know, and it looks just like her.  It certainly does.  Yeah.  And they say in Rex Ryan off-camera,  the Rex Ryan guy sounds just like Rex Ryan.  Yeah.  And I speak for the entire gen nation.  No one's surprised.  No.  We all knew Rex was into something.  He's a little...  And this is what it is.  He's got a little...  In my humble opinion, because we don't know for sure.  Right, Anthony?  Oh, of course.  Of course.  We don't know for sure.  We're just basing it on what we see on this video.  And in my opinion, it looks just like her.  And this thing is everywhere. 
[01:15:00]  My boy Ted Williams Head have this?  I'll find out.  TedWilliamsHead.com?  That's where I go for my sports blogging.  I want to hear some of that.  Yeah, you don't have to go.  Play the version you got.  Just trying to get my buddy a phone.  They're, like, really soft.  They're, like, really soft.  That's him.  It's a green car.  She's wearing green and white.  I like to take good care of him. 
[01:15:30]  Dress him up.  Put his shoes.  Show up.  I don't get the foot thing.  Dye small ankles and I take it.  Get your hair.  She's talking up her tootsies.  She says, I keep a pedicure on a very great place.  They'll look good.  I like to show them off.  Yeah.  People like to look at them.  Is it okay to touch them again?  Sure.  Can I smell them?  Sure.  Can I smell them? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  But most men like to do a lot of things with those people.  What?  It's him.  Pause this.  It sounds...  That's Rex Ryan.  Do they have...  It sounds just fucking like him.  Do they have to fire my coach now?  This is crazy.  It sounds...  Come on.  This pulls the Brett Favre cock thing out of the water.  Sure.  He's got the same little voice and accent he...  The NFL has that whole morality cause bullshit, right?  Yeah. 
[01:16:30]  But this is him and his wife videotaping her feet.  What's wrong with that?  Oh, my God.  Are they going to fire the coach before the playoffs?  They can't do that?  All right.  They won't care.  All right.  Push play.  Let's hear a little more speedy stuff.  Well, ma'am, can I take your number or see your driver's license?  Sure.  Okay.  Thank you.  I'm going to turn this thing off.  All right.  Now it's a new scene.  It's inside a room.  It could be a hotel.  It could be their house. 
[01:17:00]  She's just rubbing her feet together on a tabletop, it seems.  That gets guys hard, I guess?  Perhaps it gets Rex Ryan.  And he's got a kind of a footy thing, maybe.  You don't want an ugly foot, but...  Yeah, that's just it.  I've always said it's part of the whole package.  Right, but you don't...  I could appreciate a cute foot.  For a second or two.  It's something that's like part of the entire thing.  Don't dwell too long.  It's got to fit the person. 
[01:17:30]  They make boring videos.  They do.  This isn't like fucking...  She's just scrunching her toes over and over again.  This is no Lindsay Lohan or Paris Hilton stuff.  Nah.  No fucking night shot foot things.  Oh.  All right.  Here she goes.  Change scenes.  She's got a beer in her hand.  She's on the couch.  There's fucking jet jerseys hanging up on the wall behind...  No.  Teasing, of course.  She's just kind of showing off her feet.  Some more.  And is he saying anything?  No. 
[01:18:00]  This video sucks.  It's just pretty much her rubbing her feet together.  She's wiggling her toes.  He must really be...  Whoever's holding this camera must really be into the foot thing.  Sure.  She's drinking a beer.  Now she's massaging her own foot.  Is that like masturbation?  Is that like masturbation?  She's dittling her foot.  Yes.  Yes.  It is?  It's exactly like it.  Is that a whole...  And then she's smelling her hand that she just was massaging her foot with.  Is that when you're supposed to shoot cum?  Yeah.  It's when you make cumzies on her feet.  Like fucking... 
[01:18:30]  They're pretty, aren't they?  What?  Size five and a half.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Narrow.  Nice high and stiff.  And bright red toenail polish.  Oh, yeah?  Just had a pedicure a few days ago.  Oh, you did?  So they're very nice and soft.  And then she sips her beer.  And scene, right?  That's about it.  Right there.  That's the video that everyone's watching?  That's what's sweeping the football nation right about now. 
[01:19:00]  That first one.  Boring.  Yeah, they sure don't really know how to sexy up a video.  But that first one.  That's a little rough.  That sounded like it.  Can we get a clip of Rex Ryan just talking?  Sure.  One of his little press conference things.  Because I have that sound in my head now.  Okay.  Of the guy.  The way he was talking.  He's got a slight weird...  Where are they from?  I don't know.  Originally?  I really don't know.  Because there is some kind of an accent there that isn't, you know,  New York. 
[01:19:30]  My name is Chris.  I'm out.  There's an advertisement.  Cleveland?  That's an advertisement.  This is a black gentleman speaking.  So let's just blast through this.  Can you fast forward to the ads?  No.  You could never.  Okay.  They're from Ohio.  And that was definitely an Ohio type accent.  Accent?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here it is.  Let's see.  Rex Ryan.  Let's hear what he said.  This Sunday, our Cleveland Browns will be going for their third win in a row  when they take on the New York Jets right here at Brown Stadium. 
[01:20:00]  But this week, there's been a bit of drama as the twin Ryan brothers will be coaching  against each other.  News Channel 5's Ted Kortan says the trash talking has reached a new low.  Get a load of this guy, a long blonde wig, a big balloon belly, and Browns logos?  Believe it or not, that's Rex Ryan, the head football coach of the New York Jets.  It's very obvious that's it.  I'm placing a bounty on my brother's head.  And this is the brother...  On my brother's head. 
[01:20:30]  And the football coach of the New York Jets.  I'm placing a bounty on my brother's head.  Yeah, you can't really get much from that.  Yeah, but we're going to compare right now.  How do you touch him?  Thank you.  What do you think?  The problem is he's kind of like, you know...  He's got a sexy voice on there and he's got his football voice on.  In the other one.  Johnny S. writes, her videos are so hot, especially the one with her wearing pantyhose and popping  off her heels.  You guys just don't understand.  Wait, I didn't see that one. 
[01:21:00]  I will openly admit I don't understand this one.  Yeah, I don't get the...  I don't get it, but I know a lot of people are into it.  I know.  So there's more videos of her?  Or...  I guess.  Wow.  All right, well, what are we going to do with this?  Oh, boy.  Front page of the paper.  Rex Ryan possibly in a foot fetish video with his wife.  It's not scandalous, but it is a little, I would think, embarrassing for him and her.  Like, what are they doing with these videos?  It was almost role-playing.  Like, he was walking past the car. 
[01:21:30]  Her feet were hanging out and he was asking her questions about her feet.  I, I, my, my hunch, it's a little commercial to maybe get some other couples involved.  Oh, shit.  You think they're swinging?  That's my, that's my hunch.  You think they're swinging?  Why else is she promoting her feet?  They're swinging.  It's a conspiracy, isn't it?  It's a conspiracy.  Bah, he likes the feet.  Yeah, I don't, uh...  I don't know.  I really don't.  I don't know what it's about, but it's just embarrassing. 
[01:22:00]  It's not, it's not scandalous.  No.  It's, it's embarrassing in that it opens up a little bit of part of you that maybe you  don't want out there kind of a thing.  But it's not like showing your cock or anything or, you know, he's not cheating.  It's not anything on video that can't be watched by anybody.  He wasn't rubbing his big fat Rex Ryan helmet on his toes.  Now, that would have been funny.  Oh, my God.  The camera pulls back and he's just like fucking love snotting all over her fucking cuticles.  Oh, my God. 
[01:22:30]  Then we would lose the coach right before...  Oh, it would be done.  ...a possible playoff run.  It would be done.  Oh, God, that would suck.  All right, well, that's all we got on that, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, uh, Pat, Pat lost weight?  No.  Oh, it can only, that can't be a healthy weight loss.  No?  He's got to be dying.  Are you dying, Pat?  Eh, eh, I don't know, but I will be in seconds.  I'm good at charades.  No, no, you look the same.  Oh, no, you look the same.  Take a seat there for a...  Yeah, I want to see what's...  We got a couple of mics. 
[01:23:00]  Here's the chair.  Here's the chair.  Well, where do you want to sit?  I want to see where Pat...  Oh, you want to sit in Jimmy's seat, do you?  Yeah, go ahead.  Sit in Jimmy Norton's seat.  You think you can...  He ain't here.  He ain't here.  Take Jimmy's place there.  Very comfortable.  Are you a Jets fan?  Uh, eh, whatever.  Yeah, Pat Fermanaki's one of the guys.  Hasn't been on the radio in a while.  I don't know why.  He's very, very funny.  Maybe like Pat.  You had to hang out with Stalker Patty out there in Bobo.  Yeah.  Oh, Stalker Patty.  Just dropped a few points. 
[01:23:30]  Are you sick of me?  Visions of Sugar Plums.  They loved it in with retards?  Danced in their heads.  Yeah.  You don't like being grouped in with those guys?  Oh, no.  I relate.  When the call comes in, you're thinking,  oh, wow, the guys just want me because I'm funny.  Yeah.  And then also...  This is my shot.  This is my big shot.  And then you show up and see these...  I'll be fielding offers.  Yeah.  It's shithead cavalcade out there.  And I'm one of the shitheads.  Oscar's here, too.  Oscar is here.  Hey, I don't want to move on from the foot thing. 
[01:24:00]  No, I don't either.  Hold on a minute.  Steve from Pennsylvania for one second.  Steve, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  I think it's a whole setup, man.  Just like Reebok did with the guy from the MMA.  Chuck Liddell.  Oh, like you think it's going to turn into a sneaker ad.  Yeah, man.  How they get everybody talking about it and this big controversy and all this Reebok's  going to spit something out.  Why would they use an average-looking woman? 
[01:24:30]  No, because it's Rex Ryan.  Rex Ryan, man.  Like, it's Rex Ryan's wife and Rex Ryan.  It doesn't matter what she looks like.  It's who they are.  And then this gets a bunch of fucking play, and then they do another one where she's  got her fucking Reeboks on or some shit.  Oh, man.  Now we're there.  Now we're thinking.  Now we're thinking.  We should have thought of that ourselves, but I like it.  I like your theory on that.  Look at you.  We'll have to wait and see.  Reebok.  Wasn't that a Vulcan? 
[01:25:00]  Oh, my God.  His first bomb.  That was bad?  Wow.  That was a bad one.  You want to bring Patty in, too?  Patty.  Yeah, bring dumb Patty in here.  It's visions of sugar plums danced in my head.  Here comes the affected Patty.  Hi, Patty.  Patty, first thing I want to ask you, how much vacation time do you have built up now  from Starbucks?  Well, I just put down for the five hours that I accrued, so now I'm back to 45 minutes. 
[01:25:30]  She accrued five hours of vacation time.  Now, how long did that take you to get five hours, 45 minutes of vacation time?  This is from Starbucks, by the way.  Three weeks.  Three weeks?  Yeah.  So you worked hard for three weeks to get five hours of vacation time, and you're using  the five hours to come in here today?  Well, yeah.  Oh.  Ask her what her commute time is to work six hours.  What is your commute time? 
[01:26:00]  About 90 minutes from the time I get on the bus to the time I get off the train.  Wait, where is where you live now?  Where do you live, and where do you work?  I live in Staten Island.  And you work in Manhattan?  Yeah.  Because there's no Starbucks in Staten Island.  No, no, Staten Island.  If I could walk outside your apartment, there's one right there.  Probably.  Can't they transfer you to one of those?  Yeah.  They're not transferring people, and they're not really hiring right now, so I'm lucky  I am where I am.  Who split your lip?  She's got a little lippy out in the hole.  Somebody fight. 
[01:26:30]  It looks like someone popped you in the mouth.  No, it's just the cold.  They get very chapped in the wintertime.  Wintertime.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't like the cold.  Still a virgin?  Yes.  How old are we now?  55 and eight months.  Holy cow.  No, actually, 55 and a half.  I will be 56.  Didn't we do something for your 50th?  Remember when she was a 45-year-old virgin or some shit?  Well, I'm going for the world record.  What's that?  How long I could stay a virgin. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, that's great.  That's pleasurable.  I think Mother Teresa has you beat.  Yeah.  I might beat her.  Oh, Patty.  What's with your affected voice that you put on during those readings?  Oh, I really get into it, and I have fun when I'm doing it.  And I was a speech and theater major, so I really put my all into it.  It's fun.  It's pointing out.  Put your all into it?  Yeah.  That's a lot of nothing. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Really?  Somebody said I did really good with the Thanksgiving one.  Who said that?  Oh, people.  You know, my Facebook and stuff.  You want to give out your Facebook page?  Yeah.  I got 976 friends.  Oh.  Wow.  And 457 followers on Twitter.  Not bad.  Wow.  What's your Twitter name?  Brooksy.  B-R-O-K-S-I.  It's my childhood nickname.  Everybody called me that because my last name is Brooks. 
[01:28:00]  Brooksy?  Yeah.  Hey, Brooksy.  What did your parents call you?  Come here.  I want to show you.  I want to show you my cock.  Hey, Brooksy, you want to do jump rope with us?  Come on.  And that's what they used to call me.  Jump rope?  You know.  What the hell were you born?  Yeah, on the Play Street.  And your real parents obviously called you Burden.  Oh, God.  Hence why they left you in a diner.  In a bassinet.  You stay here.  We'll be right back.  Yeah.  That would be really nice to just see a fucking beam with Brooksy was here written on it.  Brooksy.  And a noose.  Yes. 
[01:28:30]  There's Brooksy.  Sometimes my hands hurt.  Is that Brooksy?  Brooksy.  That's not your Twitter name.  That's not you.  R-O-O-K-S-I.  K-S-O.  Oh.  Yeah.  No E.  S-I.  No E.  No E.  That's another.  Oh, Brooksy's some other hag.  That's another Brooksy.  There's Brooksy.  Yeah, that's me.  On my way into the city to hang with the ONA show.  Yeah.  There you go.  Brooksy.  Look at that.  Look at all your friends.  Unbelievable.  Very good.  Good tweets.  What are some of her tweets?  Let's see.  Let me see.  This is the first winter solstice eclipse since the 17th century. 
[01:29:00]  17th century.  Okay.  Well, she said 17.  It was lovely back then.  Now the moon is darker and the stars seem to form a circle around it.  I was describing the eclipse.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Maybe we could go to like the news and see that.  On the metro north, headed back to the city, then home.  Wow. 
[01:29:30]  I just found a $20 bill on the floor of the train station.  You did?  Yeah.  I was thrilled.  I tell you.  I was happy.  Now you got hepatitis.  Yeah.  Definitely.  I was so broke.  Oh, wow.  And then were you praying to Jesus that you find money and Jesus gave you money?  No.  I just saw it there.  22 degrees if I didn't need to go to work.  Sigh.  Oh.  You wanted to stay in bed that day. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  Strange.  The price at our local gas station seems to be going up about 10 cents a week.  That's strange?  It's part of the news.  Petroleum's going up.  The dollar's dropping, so the price of gas goes up.  And that affects you so much because you drive, right?  Yeah.  You don't drive.  I know.  I just observed it.  The only gas you should use is in your stove.  Turn it on.  Don't light it.  And put your head in the oven.  Exactly.  On the bus headed home. 
[01:30:30]  Verrazano is awesome at night.  How many times have you crossed the Verrazano Bridge?  You felt compelled to comment on it?  Well.  Went to nursing home today with a friend to see her relative and met a guy there that I  went to high school with more than 30 years ago.  Oh, my God.  Was he pissing and shitting himself and babbling incoherently?  Does he work there?  No.  He had his mother there, too.  Did you talk to him?  Did you hit it off?  Well, yeah.  He says, Patty.  I said, Bobby.  And that was it.  Are you going to go on a double date and suffocate your burdens? 
[01:31:00]  No, no.  Each other's burdens?  No, no.  That would be a good bond for you to bond to.  You could just take the pillow and smash their fucking faces until they suffocate and  then go out and tie one on.  Why are you biting your lower lip really hard?  It's creepy.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You haven't been on our show in a while.  Yeah, it has been a while.  You want some of Sam's mom's cookies?  Vinny hasn't gotten any yet.  Oh, we're waiting for Vinny?  Oh, Vinny's here, huh?  Yeah, we'll get Vinny in in a minute or two.  How about that?  Who else we got?  We got Bobo. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, I guess so.  I don't know.  Patty, what are your Christmas plans?  Oh, that's a good question.  Because a lot of people we know, a lot of you people that we've dragged up here today,  you know, you might have a lot of Facebook friends, but probably not too many real ones.  So what do you do on Christmas Day?  How do you spend the holidays?  Okay, Christmas Eve, I'm going to go to my friend's house.  He was my boss 30 years ago for everything.  Everything's 30 years ago with her.  But I've known him that long.  I said, I'm going to go with his family for Christmas Eve dinner at his restaurant down 
[01:32:00]  on Long Beach Island.  Oh, so you're going to inconvenience somebody else's family by honing in on their Christmas?  Is that what you're doing?  No, I spend Christmas Eve with them every year.  And then the next day, I'm going over a friend's house and having Christmas Day dinner.  A friend?  So I always have a place to go.  A friend.  Now, is that a male friend?  No, it's somebody's family.  Is it a male friend, though?  Yeah, he's a guy who has a family. 
[01:32:30]  Are you going to fuck him?  No, I don't think so.  No, no, no, no.  God forbid you get something in that pussy.  Yeah, God forbid you fucking give them a little favor back.  I don't care how long you've known them, you give a favor back.  They invite you over for Christmas, you give them a blowjob.  That's the rate of exchange right now.  One Christmas dinner, one blowjob.  That sure helped those dry lips of yours.  Yeah. 
[01:33:00]  Do you just talk and are they just like, are they looking away from you and just saying,  yeah, yeah, yeah, and talking amongst themselves when you say things?  No.  No, we all talk together.  Really?  What do you talk about?  Oh, I don't know.  What kind of things?  Interests?  Well, not really.  Just making jokes and small talk.  Jokes.  Well, you're good at that.  We know that you have very small talk.  You know, watching each other open our gifts and stuff.  Oh, so you share gifts at that little get-together?  Yeah, I buy little presents for them.  What have you gotten people this year?  Starbucks cards. 
[01:33:30]  Well, I got some-  Starbucks cards.  Starbucks cards.  Well, I got some Avon.  Espresso grounds roast coffee?  Avon.  Avon?  Avon?  Well, for four people, I got some Avon for because they like it.  Because they smell?  They smell poorly?  No.  No.  Okay.  And then for some people, it got some coffee beans because they do like good coffee.  Just beans?  They got to grind it themselves?  Well, two of them have their own coffee makers that you grind the beans on top. 
[01:34:00]  I know, Patty.  I buy my own coffee.  When you give me coffee, it's shit.  I want to taste it.  She's never seen Pulp Fiction.  No, that's a great one for Pulp Fiction.  Apparently, how about you go see Pulp Fiction in one of these days?  See a movie that maybe people have seen.  What about Pat?  What are you doing for the holidays, Pat?  The usual.  Oh, shit.  At least you don't have to buy for anyone.  Yeah, that's true.  Oh.  I spend some quality time with my pets.  You're not spending Christmas in that godforsaken trailer at the end of the runway at Teterboro, 
[01:34:30]  are you?  Uh, no.  Did you lose the trailer?  Oh, my God.  You still have the trailer, right?  Oh, yeah.  Pat from Unaki, how would you like to spend Christmas at the compound?  Oh!  Well, how could I refuse such an offer?  Well, first you can mow my lawn.  Oh!  No, I'm having a big, uh...  Do I have to give you a blowjob? 
[01:35:00]  Invite me over.  I did say that was the rate of exchange.  No, of course, you're welcome to come over.  I'd say I won't, but...  Having, uh, having the whole family.  Why would you just do that right in front of Stalker Patty?  Yeah, what about...  She would upgrade her Christmas experience.  Patty, would you like to come over to the compound for Christmas?  Oh.  For Christmas?  Well...  Then I'm not coming.  Well, I already have Christmas.  I didn't say I was inviting her.  I said, would she like to?  Oh, you just want to.  The answer is, well, tough shit.  Oh!  Oh, I would love to someday come and see your movie theater. 
[01:35:30]  I bet you would.  I bet you would.  You know.  A lot of people would.  Of course.  A billion dollar black ops.  Yeah, a lot of people would.  It's a special treat.  Just ask anybody.  You can ask, because you'll never see.  But, of course, Pat, you're absolutely welcome to come over.  I'm in a shindig.  It's being a...  What?  What?  Iraq?  Can I come?  Oh, he invited himself.  How awkward.  That's really uncomfortable.  How nagel.  Oh, he nagled that one up.  He tried to nagel his way into my party.  That's exactly, yeah.  He's like a fish, because he finagled. 
[01:36:00]  I didn't finagle.  And then you would say, okay, I guess.  And then he would say, Ant said it was okay.  And that, my friends, is nageling his way into the place.  That's nageling.  Unfortunately, I had one spot open.  And Pat just took it.  Oops.  Fire hazard.  And I have a rule.  Only nine-toed people can be asked after a certain date.  Wow, how lucky.  I know.  You got very lucky.  You still have nine, right?  Yeah.  So far.  No, it grew back like a lizard tail. 
[01:36:30]  I'd take inventory this morning, but...  I was going the other way.  You might be down to eight at this point.  Oh, that's true, yeah.  Yeah, but I have, you know, family and friends come over and stuff like that.  So feel free.  It's being catered by, of course, you know, the guy from Basal Tees.  Yeah.  It used to be Basal Tees.  Now it's the new place that I wish I knew the name of.  Oh, boy.  He's going to give me some shit.  He sure is.  But great food.  Yeah.  Great food.  Good time.  The bar's open, and you're welcome.  Nice.  That means you've got to get gifts now, Pat. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Because Pat usually spends Christmas by himself.  And get me something good.  I don't fucking...  In the trail.  I can buy whatever I want on a whim.  You've got to find a gun catalog somewhere.  Yeah.  Has, has, has.  Got him, got him, got him.  Need him, got him, need him, need him, got him.  Pat, so you would have just been in your trailer by yourself for Christmas?  Uh...  Did you try to, like, make it a little different?  Could you park down the street and come in the back entrance, though?  Well, I stopped the facade of having Christmas decorations.  For yourself?  I used to have a tree, then my dog would pee on it. 
[01:37:30]  And the cats would scratch at it and stuff.  So now you're like, fuck it.  Yeah.  I put a small wreath on my door, and that's all that's enough for me.  Really?  Yeah.  See, we were just laughing at what Pat said, because it was funny.  I can't stand all the campy stuff, so I'd rather just put a wreath.  What campy stuff?  Oh, like a Santa Claus.  Oh, you know, oh, the shit, just because you can't fucking afford it doesn't mean it's campy,  fucker.  No.  It's good Christmas decoration.  It's good Christmas fun.  It's called fun and festivities and joy.  Oh, I know. 
[01:38:00]  I enjoy the lights.  I love the lights.  Yeah, I wish it was a bright white one and you'd walk into it.  See?  Because that means...  That's just me.  Well, I'm probably destined for heaven anyway, so...  You really think you are?  Yes.  You crawled around naked in a Krusty the Clown mask for money.  God doesn't look kindly upon that.  Let's see.  Oh, God loves me.  Keep that in mind when you're fucking getting a deathbed confession.  Yeah, but you were kind of...  Now, literally, you have a bad one.  I've heard...  Murmur.  Murmur.  Well, that's true. 
[01:38:30]  Murmur.  Yeah.  I do have a weak one.  But crawling around like that is kind of whorish.  Yes, it's Chef Steve.  Chef Steve at the Artisan, which used to be basil teas.  And frankincense, yeah.  In Tom's River, New Jersey, it's Artisan, it's Chef Steve.  He's a great guy.  I have him cater all my events.  Why don't we...  All my soirees, as I like to call them.  Why don't we get Bobo in here?  Where's the Bobo?  Yes, because I would like to give another invitation out.  Ooh.  Yes?  To a burlap sack next to a lake with rocks in it. 
[01:39:00]  Hey, Bobo, you're looking fucking manly.  You got a beard and everything.  Why you got a beard, Bobo?  What the fuck is that?  Sam goes to give him the mic and just smushed it in his face for no reason.  That's a mistake.  Hey, Bloblo, what's with the beard?  That's because I thought my face would be warmer during the wintertime if I had a beard.  Warmer emotionally to other people or physically warmer?  No, my face would be warmer and I noticed it's a little bit warmer during the wintertime.  It's a little bit warmer.  It was poor, but it was a joke. 
[01:39:30]  So is it working?  Is it working like a little face mask?  It works a little bit.  I bet it doesn't.  It doesn't, of course not.  You have a rugged look to you.  He can grow a fucking beard.  Yeah, he can.  Which is weird because you're like kind of a baby face thing.  You're a little squirrely, wormy, little kitty looking thing.  Yet you can grow a full fucking beard and mustache.  Goddamn.  You're like Magnum P.I. hair you can grow. 
[01:40:00]  Frank O'Harris.  Yeah.  Frank O'Harris.  Frank O'Harris, yes.  Very good.  Your mustache is coming in better than Patty's.  I don't have a mustache anymore.  No, you're waxed.  That's debatable.  What'd you do?  Did you get a laser?  Well, yeah, you know the people down in Hartsdale?  You know, at the New York Air Removal, they still do me once every six months.  They're the only people that are virgin. 
[01:40:30]  They're very nice, too.  I love them.  Every time I go, I either give them a box of chocolates or a thing of coffee.  How about money?  They're fucking taking hair off your face.  You don't give them money, Patty?  Charity case?  They don't charge me, so I bring them something.  They were on our show 12 years ago, and you're still getting freebies from them?  It's just like every six to eight months.  She just gave a plug.  That's pretty smart.  That's true.  That was smart.  What kind of hair do they have?  Yeah, what do they take off of you?  Well, they do my lip, they do my arms, and they do my boobs.  They do your nipples? 
[01:41:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  Because you've got hairy nipples.  Not anymore.  In fact, the last time I had that done was two years ago.  That's really good.  Stalker Wookie.  I know.  Did you use Han Solo's blaster as a laser treatment on your face?  No.  Jesus Christ.  Stop it.  What are you doing for Christmas?  Bobo, Christmas plans?  What do you got?  Not really much Christmas plans, except for being at home, my mother, my sister, and my  neighbor.  That hot sister? 
[01:41:30]  Oh, yeah.  Well, I've heard people say stuff about her at school.  I bet you have.  What do they say?  No, my sister doesn't feel like dating until she's 18.  What the hell is that?  That's a crime, isn't it?  That's my sister's decision.  She'll never see the compound.  She lost his phone.  That's my sister's decision.  I have a feeling by the time she's a senior at high school, she'll be dating.  She'll be dating.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She'll be dating.  What do you want for Christmas there, Bobo? 
[01:42:00]  Well, a portable radio unit would be nice.  Don't watch that.  One less chromosome.  They don't make them anymore.  Well, whatever the new version of it is, it's called a cell phone.  It's called an iPhone, or, you know, it's called a smartphone.  With the app.  Anything but a fucking, what are you, a T-ack, or whatever.  What were those things called?  Oh, a StarTac.  A StarTac.  All right.  Isn't it sad that no matter what smartphone you got, it would be smarter than you? 
[01:42:30]  You need a dumb phone.  Yeah, you need a dumb phone.  It's very hard to Google for a dumb phone.  You know.  All right.  That's kind of sad, though.  Do you do Christmas Day, Christmas Eve?  What do you do?  Usually Christmas Eve.  Yeah.  Now, did you get presents for other people, or are you just too goddamn broke?  There was some money I had, so I was going to start.  I had some money recently, so I was starting to look into ordering some stuff. 
[01:43:00]  You were looking into it.  Do you realize that Christmas is days away?  Why don't you get a beautiful Vermont teddy bear?  Christmas delivery guaranteed from the Vermont teddy bear company.  Call 1-800-829-BEAR.  Does that count?  Is that what they call integration?  That was integration, Pat.  Okay.  Integration.  Well, there's no black people in here.  Where's Oscar?  We should bring Oscar in here.  Oh, Sam.  I forgot.  Yeah.  Wow, Bobo.  And, uh, all right, so, in other words, no, you haven't gotten any one Christmas presents. 
[01:43:30]  He's thinking about it.  I've gotten some already.  Some of them have already been...  Hey, good morning.  All right.  Oscar.  Oscar.  Holy shit.  Oscar's my Christmas gift.  Nervous Oscar.  A fat Ricky Martin.  Yeah.  Sorry, Oscar.  Oh, it's all right.  It's all good.  Oscar just tripped over the chair coming in here.  He did.  He was running in saying, how are you doing, tripping?  Oscar's a very nervous guy.  Yeah. 
[01:44:00]  And you left us about six months ago or so?  No, three months.  Something.  Oh, really?  Three months?  Seems like six months.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Give us an update.  What has happened to you since you're leaving the Opie and Anthony show for a greener passion?  You have the Opie and Anthony show under your belt.  You go out into life.  Let us in on what happens.  Oh, well, I guess I just finished the fall semester.  Yeah.  I mean, I just got an internship at CNBC for the spring.  CNBC?  Yeah, yeah.  So I'll be working in technical operations out of Engelwood Cliffs.  I'm looking forward to some insider trading convictions from you. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, I'll probably hook you up with something.  Don't tell anybody about it.  This is outsider trading, the way you're doing it.  It's not very good.  Yeah.  So an internship over there.  Yeah, yeah.  That's pretty good.  And then what are you doing for the Christmas holiday season there?  Oh, I'll be...  You've got Christmas break, right?  You're off.  Yeah, I'm right.  So I'm just working right now.  Working?  Doing what?  I work at a retail store in Morristown, so...  Oh, really?  What are you selling? 
[01:45:00]  Oh, I sell Skull.  The company is called Square Luggage.  I sell luggage.  I know, I know.  It's weird.  But listen, the thing is, it's like a travel wear store.  So you're traveling, you know, I provide the goods.  You come in and I help you out.  So I come in and you go...  Can I help you?  No, no, no.  I'm usually more chill over there.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  And then I'm like, sir, I'm looking for something, because I don't like the airlines charging for luggage.  And so I'm looking for something in a carry-on bag that is the biggest carry-on I could take, 
[01:45:30]  but that will fit in the overhead compartment.  What do you have for me?  Yo, I can hook you up, man.  A little 20-inch, man.  You know, wide body and then great quality.  What kind of features, though, does it have inside?  Yeah, absolutely.  Is it full features for a suit?  Can I pack a suit in this without it being all wrinkled?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah, I can set you up with that.  You know, I have a curtain and stuff you can put in there and keep everything nice wrinkle-free.  Is there another luggage store around?  No, no.  Can I go to one down the road, sir?  No, no.  Go to the one I work at, man.  So it's really nice.  No, I'd be asking you this after seeing your reaction to my weapon. 
[01:46:00]  I can say, sir, is there another place I could go to buy luggage?  Because you scare me.  No, no.  I don't scare me.  I'm usually chill.  Like, you know, I'm really calm and stuff.  And I do customer service, too.  So, you know, I answer the phone and people bitch at me.  And I just tell them to start me to come in.  It's like, hey, the wheel is wobbly on my luggage.  And you go, hey, sorry, bro.  Yeah, I know.  He's got the cadence of a comedian.  He does.  You really do have the cadence of a comedian.  Without the material.  Oh, he's got a story.  He's got a story.  What?  Yeah, no, I was pulling so hard on that door. 
[01:46:30]  I thought somebody was...  And it pushes in.  So I was...  Oh, you were pulling on the door.  Yeah, I feel like an asshole.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck.  I thought he was on the door, you know, before I was just trying not to...  Yeah, I know.  Bobo doesn't like Oscar, do you, Bobo?  No, we don't.  Not like Oscar.  I like Oscar.  I don't know, Bobo.  You said you were pissed off because Oscar kind of took your place.  He did.  He stole your thunder.  You do know that.  What little thunder you ever had.  He's much better at it, too.  Yeah, he is.  I'm not...  I'm not...  I'm not upset at Oscar or anything.  Well, you remember over the summer when we stopped calling you to come on the show. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, I...  That's because we had Oscar coming on the show.  I was partly upset, but I was always trying to hold back my anger.  Oh, that's always healthy to do, by the way.  Why are you holding it back?  Yeah, I...  Hold it back.  Bury that anger deep, deep in heart.  I don't want to get anger at somebody, because there was one time a few years ago, my sister's  father, I got into a...  You shot a man in Reno just to watch him die, right?  No, no, I got very...  But he did.  That's very funny. 
[01:47:30]  I felt like that at the time.  Thank you.  That's my goal.  I'll admit I felt like that at the time, but...  Yeah?  I got angry during the time.  What'd you do to the guy?  No, it was...  You would like me when I'm angry.  What'd you do?  He turned green and my clothes ripped off, and I punched him in the face and moved on  to another town to slow music.  No, no, it was something...  It was my sister's 13th.  He's answering it to...  It was my sister's 13th birthday.  13th birthday.  Yeah.  And you were mad at me because I came home.  What happened? 
[01:48:00]  And it was...  And I was trying to videotape it, hold the camera.  Oh, yeah.  And...  This is getting hot now.  No, it was just a birthday party in the back row, right?  There wasn't anything going on.  I like how he answers the inane things I say.  But I'm holding the camera...  Uh-huh.  ...and it was too crowded that I'm trying to hold...  So I'm trying to get a spot that isn't blocked.  Yeah.  And my mother told me to videotape staying there, right?  To videotape what?  No, to stand at that spot, right? 
[01:48:30]  Oh, to stand at that spot.  And I had to hold the camera sort of way, and I was having trouble holding the camera, right?  Right.  And he was asking me to move, and I was saying, I can't move like that, and I got pissed off at him.  I almost hit him.  Almost.  Almost.  But you didn't hit him.  I nearly hit him, but he got...  But you didn't hit him, so you're angrily having that.  You don't have an anger problem.  You don't have an anger story.  You controlled your anger.  He almost reported.  He's still mad at me because of it.  Who is he?  My sister's father. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, it's a different guy than your father.  Yeah.  Oh, that's why she's...  Oscar's laughing at that.  Yeah, that's why my sister's got a different last name than me.  She's got her father's last name.  We didn't even know that.  Oscar, why are you kind of laughing?  No, I know a lot of people like that.  They seem to go down an assembly line, different fathers.  I mean, that's a type of girls.  I know.  You are Hispanic, right?  Oh, you know what?  Actually, that was funny.  That was the other day I was in the car.  Yeah.  And what happened, I mean, I love children, but it's just, there's no need for people to  have like so many kids. 
[01:49:30]  I mean, there's overpopulation in the world and people are just like freaking squeezing  them out, like, you know, left and right.  I'm like, people relax.  I mean, if you can't provide for the children, why are you having so many?  I mean, but nothing against people or anything like that.  It's just, I'd like to hear you say that to my grandmother.  Shut up, Bobo.  I forgot that angle.  I'd like to hear you say that to my grandmother, all right?  My mother has a number of siblings.  Hey, Roland's in studio.  Why is Roland here?  Roland.  I don't know.  Sam told me to come back here.  Roland.  I hear you're not a fan of Bobo. 
[01:50:00]  Fuck no.  I mean, I'll get some.  I mean, that was in the office.  He just won't shut up.  Yeah, he doesn't shut up, right?  He was giving me coffee.  I'm like, really?  Are you a celebrity?  He was trying to get you to get him coffee?  I got it for him.  Yeah, because I didn't.  Oh.  Oh, I said, lick my asshole before I ever get you coffee.  Why wouldn't you get your own coffee, Bobo?  Oh, I would get my own coffee if I was told that it was okay for me to get coffee.  Well, if Patty can get it for you, then you could probably get it for yourself.  She's no better than you. 
[01:50:30]  Exactly.  And he was like light and sweet.  That was an insult to Patty, by the way.  Like he was my customer at Starbucks.  Oh.  She's laughing.  It sounded like she's watching prior.  Starbucks fucking humor is terrific, right?  It was going through the office.  It was hilarious.  I know.  When you were pouring it out, were you like, well, I'm at work.  Look at this.  I was like, yeah, there's different varieties.  I said to myself, he'll take the coffee I give him.  Oh.  Sassy. 
[01:51:00]  Sassy.  She became more sassy.  She said, if you want more sugar, you can wiggle your hips over there.  Oh.  Yeah, I gave him four.  I don't know how sweet.  Some people put ten packages in.  Oh, that's crazy.  The boy says, you want it sweeter.  You wiggle your little hips over there and get it.  You'll sound.  Oh, wow.  Were you trying to pick him up or something?  No.  That's crazy.  Because that's like sexy talk out of you.  I want to know some more lines that you use at Starbucks.  Some more Starbucks humor, Patty.  Yeah, Patty, what are you doing?  Did I spill your coffee?  You got any other go-to lines? 
[01:51:30]  She spilled my coffee.  You fucking bitch.  Any other go-to lines?  I'm sorry, sir.  Go-to lines?  Yeah, you go-to lines.  You have lines that you use on a daily basis because you know you got different people coming in.  Yeah, that's good.  And you want them to feel good for the day.  So you got a standard thing that you say in the morning?  Yeah, I say, hi, how are you?  How you doing?  What can I do for you?  Die?  Do they ever say that back to you?  Well, if I died, I wouldn't be able to get their coffee.  Do they?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit. 
[01:52:00]  God damn it, she's funny.  She's got the comebacks.  She's got the fucking comebacks.  Watch out, Oscar.  How about this?  Uh, give me your motherfucking money, bitch.  What would you say to that?  Good morning.  Hello.  Yeah, what would you say to that?  I would say, well, we get a lot of cops that come in.  I would say you could talk to the person in back of you about that.  Oh, shit.  Oh, really?  There we go.  Now I'll just rifle through the register, uh, you know, above your bloody corpse.  I cannot open the register without a sale. 
[01:52:30]  All right.  There.  You just sold two shotgun shells.  Never had that experience yet.  No, huh?  Not that you haven't been robbed yet?  No.  You ever been, uh, robbed or assaulted or anything on the, you've lived in New York a while.  Not counting this show.  Some shady, yes, exactly.  You've lived in some shady places.  The only time that ever happened was when I was 10 years old and I had my transistor  radio and I was holding it in my hand and then these five boys were walking right past 
[01:53:00]  me.  Were you listening to the Hindenburg crashing?  Next thing you know, I had nothing in my hand.  Of course they took it.  They jostled me.  What do you mean by five boys?  Uh-oh.  They were coming out of the shop.  I was going into the shop.  Let me guess.  Spanky, alfalfa, stymie, buckwheat.  Oh, not that far back.  This was the 60s.  Oh, man.  Were they hippies or were they black kids?  No, they weren't kids.  They were just white kids from the school.  Little hippie.  You know.  They were the same.  Yeah, were they all jacked up on the hooch?  I don't know. 
[01:53:30]  Were they on Benny's, Dexy's, meth?  I have no idea.  All I know is that I came in with my transistor radio in my hand.  One moment you're smoking a marijuana cigarette, the next you're stealing transistor radios  from future hags.  And then they walked past me and my hand was empty.  Wow.  That's pretty good.  So it was a magician.  They did a magic act for you.  Like a magic act.  Did they wave their hands when they did it?  Yeah.  No, they just went like that and that was it.  And when I got home, I got in trouble.  They stole it and then you heard...  No, they stole it. 
[01:54:00]  I went home and I got hit on the face because I, you know.  I bet you got something else, too.  Because we all know about your youth.  Did you get a hiney spanking?  Yeah, I did get a spanking.  On your hiney, right?  Yeah, well, yeah.  That was typical discipline in those days.  It was normal.  Hold on.  In a sense, you're right.  But the bare bottom was a little much, right?  No.  Oh, God.  They didn't do that, no.  No, they did. 
[01:54:30]  But I was...  They did.  Well, they didn't spank me for that, you know.  But they gave...  They would pull down your pants and give you the bare bottom spanking.  The only time that ever happened was when I crossed the busy street by myself and I  got two slips with the strap and that was it.  But it was your bare bottom.  Yeah.  Well, that time, yeah.  They had to show me not to go across the street.  And was it your foster father pulled your pants and your little panties down, right?  Warmed it up.  And then spanked your bare bottom. 
[01:55:00]  Well, yeah.  Two times and that was it.  And then did he say anything to you?  Did he kiss it?  Did he rub it to make it better?  No.  He said, go to your room and sit there and think about not crossing busy streets.  Did he have a giant rod when he did it?  No.  Only a yardstick.  No, I mean...  Oh, a yardstick.  Wow.  Hey.  All right.  This guy's good.  In fact, I used...  Whatever you want to call it.  In fact, my brother at the time and I used to hide the yardstick. 
[01:55:30]  Oh!  The yardstick!  I love playing hide the yardstick!  Whoa!  Patty, you're crazy.  You played that with your brother.  Wow.  You played the yardstick with your brother?  So did Bobo!  Bobo!  Yeah!  Bobo!  Fucked by his brother.  Yeah.  Fucked by his brother, Bobo.  I don't think that even happened.  Yes, it did.  I don't think that even happened, which means it did.  At this point...  It's called a fresh memory. 
[01:56:00]  At this point, the beauty of the show, he's not even sure.  We've convinced him it happened.  It's so twisted, I can't even tell you.  Because I only got to know my brothers the first four years of my life and then saw him  in 2008.  And he ran away when you guys met, right?  No.  What happened was when my father died, his mother didn't let my brothers see me after  my father died.  Were you invisible?  No, I just...  Oh, I'll figure it out.  Somehow he got cropped out of those family pictures. 
[01:56:30]  No, what it is is I didn't see my half-brothers, the only relatives that I know of from my father's  side.  Yeah.  How many moms and dads do you have?  Yeah.  No, what it is is my brothers have a different mother.  My brothers have a different mother.  Your sister has a different father.  My brother, right?  Right.  My brothers have the same last name because they had the same father.  Yeah, we know how the father name thing works.  But how did that happen?  So who's the whore in this whole thing? 
[01:57:00]  Was your mom the whore?  Was she fucking a lot of other people?  Or was your dad the one that was drunk around?  No, my mother didn't.  She didn't date many people.  The only people she ever really dated was my father.  And your sister's father.  Yeah.  She didn't date much growing up.  But apparently she fucked everybody she dated.  That's what I'm saying.  If she had kids.  I think there was maybe another guy she may have gone out with.  I don't know.  But she didn't.  Walt Frazier? 
[01:57:30]  She hasn't been with that many guys.  No?  Wilt Chamberlain?  Wow, Bobo's story is fascinating.  We got to take a break because we got Vinny from the Jersey Shore who's going to join the  show too.  Yes.  Are these guys going to sing a Christmas carol at the break?  Yes.  Oh, wow.  Do you have a preference?  We have, like, Frosty the Snowman, Silent Night, Jingle Bells.  Frosty the Snowman.  Sleigh Ride.  With the jolly jolly suit.  Just pick one.  All right.  We'll go to Sleigh Ride.  Like it matters.  All right.  Hand out the scripts.  Hand them out. 
[01:58:00]  Hand them out.  Actually, you know what?  Take one and pass it back like the old days.  Smell the ditto.  Ooh.  Of course it'll be easier.  Silent Night.  Silent Night.  Silent Night.  You want Patty to be rude?  Hide the yardstick with your brother.  Nice.  Jesus Christ.  Preach school all over again.  The best thing is she's got no clue.  Yeah.  Do you ever have to hide the salami with your brother if you're hungry?  No.  No?  What else did you have to hide?  Anything?  Did you hide anything else around the house?  No.  Just the yardstick.  Just the yardstick?  Yeah.  Just the yardstick.  Hide the yardstick. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  That was smart because the yardstick hurt, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  How much did it hurt?  It hurt your bottom?  How much of the yardstick would you use?  Like a regular yardstick.  Like a ruler.  How much of it actually would hit that ass?  Well, not much.  I mean, I usually got hit...  How many inches of the yardstick would hit your ass?  I don't know about...  I don't know.  She took the whole thing.  That's why she's got heart damage.  I love it. 
[01:59:00]  All right.  Why are you hitting a script of Roland?  He can sing, though.  Roland's just standing there like, what am I lumped in with this shit for?  I don't know what's going on.  It's the holidays.  All right.  I'll ask you, you know how to sing?  Well, in all honesty, I mean, it's just going to be weird.  I mean...  Why?  Well, it looks like a talented bunch and everything, but I don't know.  It was just...  Swiss Army luggage.  What's your opinion?  Customers must think the store's being robbed because you're so nervous. 
[01:59:30]  No, it's not...  I mean, it's just...  Yeah, I'm in the total element.  I mean...  You'll get rid of him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You'll get a shot in the back of the head.  I like drinking at work, man.  It's fun, man.  Oh, you want?  Yeah.  I used to be a V-Ears back, man.  I remember I just went and bought like a 10-pack of like miniature Coors Light.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, and then like a 40-ouncer.  So, sure enough, you know, throughout...  I was like the happiest freaking employer...  I mean, employee in the store ever.  Hell, yeah.  It's good.  I used to do that.  That's how you would get happy employees if you let them drink on the job.  And where were you working at that point?  Well, the same... 
[02:00:00]  I've been there 10 years now.  You've been at the luggage store for 10 years?  Yeah, it'll be 10 years in March.  Oh, yeah.  Close to that.  But anyway...  No, basically, like Friday afternoon, you know, you had a nice week.  You go next door because there's a liquor store next to us.  So, you know, I just go in there and I...  Hey, Kareem, how you doing, man?  Let me get a stick.  And would you hide it in like some luggage?  No, I don't.  I just go in a little black garbage bag and just go in there in the back and just, you  know, sip and then go on the computer and shop for cars.  Hell, yeah.  Oh, you guys want to hear something crazy?  Oh.  I guess.  He can't help him.  What happened was the last day I was here in August? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  Shh.  I don't know.  Afterwards...  Just say it.  Well, I'm kind of ashamed of it, but what happened was we went out to this bar.  Some fighting dude, boxing dude owns it or something.  Yeah.  Jack Dempsey?  I don't know.  Anyways, so what happened, it was like around 12, 12.30, right?  So then I started pounding...  Did you get kicked in the balls?  We all laugh at these jokes, don't we?  Just tell me not you, too. 
[02:01:00]  Anyway, go ahead.  So I started pounding Guinness, right?  Ah.  And then what happened, I'm usually...  I'm really, you know, a good, I mean, like, beer consumer at bars.  Yeah, yeah.  Cool.  So I was sure I'm trying to drink it.  And what happened, like, you know, I was drinking them fast, right?  Oh, shit.  So it was me and the other guys, the other interns at the time.  Yeah.  And so I started pounding them down.  And, you know, I go to the guy, hey, can I got another one?  So, oh, just hold on one second.  So he thought I was getting mad at you, but I was like, listen, dude.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, exactly.  What the hell, dude?  So anyway, I ended up drinking, like, nine in, like, a matter of, like, hour and a half. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, man.  And after that, I was like, oh, shit, I can't drive like this.  No.  So I told the hell, like, done.  Why not?  Oh, no, well.  Anyways, but you know what?  The other thing was I was so hyper on Monster Energy because Sam had given me, like, four of them.  So what happened?  It was like I was, like, high drunk, not high drunk, hyper drunk.  That's it.  So, and I told Dustin, let me go back to your apartment, dude.  Let me chill there for a little bit, take a little nap.  Look, I can't drive in this condition.  Yeah.  So we ended up walking.  I don't remember.  You know how you have tunnel vision?  And it was, like, around one or two in the afternoon.  You were actually in the tunnel. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, no, it wasn't dark or anything like that.  So we started off.  We go back.  Tum-a-vision, he's walking through the Midtown Tunnel.  Yeah.  So we went back to his apartment, and then what happened, and he had some bourbon, and  then so I took a couple of shots there.  Why if you go back to sober up because you can't drive, do you drink once you get there?  Well, it was available.  I mean.  Oh, because it was available.  Oh, all right.  I should talk.  I understand completely.  Yeah, so he whips out the guitar, and it was like, I start playing, and then he goes,  you want a beer?  And I said, yeah, hell yeah.  Oh, no, no, no. 
[02:02:30]  So then I ended up drinking, like, two.  Did you guys blow each other?  No, hell no, no, absolutely.  Oh, I thought that's how it ended.  Hell no.  So afterwards, we were like, yo, I should probably eat something, you know, to, like,  mellow out, you know, get a little sobered up.  So we went across the street, and I ordered, like, a shrimp wrap.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, it was delicious.  Oh, shrimp salad.  It was good.  After all that drinking, though, it was all good.  Yeah, I know.  He's going to make some wonderful puke.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  And then we went back to the apartment, and then he gave me this cigarette.  What?  Cigarette.  No, no, no, listen.  What do you mean by cigarette? 
[02:03:00]  He's like weed.  Yeah, well, it has.  You notice when he says cigarette, he shakes his head no a little bit, and then kind of  gives you these eyes.  He gave you a cigarette.  You smoke a pot, I think.  No, well, not necessarily.  That's what I think he means.  I think he means you smoke a pot.  Like, he says cigarette, but I think he means pot, right?  Yeah.  You're talking about pot, right?  Hold on.  No, that's how he normally says cigarette.  Oscar, turn your mic off.  Was it pot?  It was tobacco and.  No, I turned your mic off.  Was it pot?  What's the pot?  Not even on.  Yeah, he's nodding.  Ah, yeah, okay.  He's nodding, yes. 
[02:03:30]  So what happened was I ended up, I'm in the midst of all this chaos.  Yeah.  I was, I was, I was frigging hyper from that bread bowl.  I was drunk, and also a little bit on the high.  Yeah.  Right, right.  You're hot.  From a cigarette?  That's weird.  No, because there was marijuana in the cigarette.  It was pot.  Right, right, right.  No, no.  It was.  It was.  It was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, shit, so.  That's out of the bag.  So we started watching Oprah.  Wow.  All right, now she's getting too crazy.  Yeah.  And then I was like, what the.  Oh, Patty.  And I should probably leave. 
[02:04:00]  So it was like close to four or five in the afternoon.  So sure enough, I start walking.  So I start walking up towards the garage where I parked, right?  And I was like, oh shit, how am I going to drive?  I started freaking out.  Yeah.  I was walking so fast that, you know, my zipper, it just, it broke, exploded.  Yo, like a truck, the end was just open.  And I was like, oh shit, I'm giving a free show here.  I was getting off.  So I kept walking.  I got to the garage.  And it was because it was the middle of the summer.  I was sweating.  Sweating.  Yeah.  Completely.  And so I got to the garage.  I was like, fuck, how am I going to drive? 
[02:04:30]  I'm like, I'm like, all drunk and shit.  I was just freaking out.  So, and then I go to pay.  And that guy is $44.  Like, $44?  I got here at the early bird.  It's like, dude, you should be $17.  It was like, no, no.  It's past 12 hours.  And I'm like, come on, man.  Listen, man, I'm an intern.  I don't get paid.  Come on, man.  And all right, it's just a one-time thing.  I was like, good, because it's the last time I'll be here.  So anyway, so the guy gave me.  So I go back, waiting for the car.  I'm sweating.  I'm like, freaking out.  I was like, fuck, I'm going to get pulled over.  And I started thinking, maybe I should go to a hotel. 
[02:05:00]  You couldn't afford $17 parking.  What the fuck are you talking about?  No, $17 I was cool with, but $44.  Come on, for parking.  So the difference, you could get a hotel room.  Yes.  Well, I mean, what do you call it?  A drunk driving ticket is a lot more.  So I was like, you know, maybe I should put it on a credit card.  I'm figuring it all out.  So the car gets there.  I'm like, oh, shit.  So I get in the car.  My hands are sweating.  I start driving really.  Pulling out of the driveway.  It's slow.  I start driving.  And I was just, and I started, I go back up the west side.  Yeah.  So I go into George Washington. 
[02:05:30]  And there was traffic.  Don't expect to pay off.  And it was traffic.  And it was just, so I was just really, I was trying to, oh, yeah, the traffic.  Wait, where was it going?  You were in traffic.  Yeah, the traffic.  So I'm like, shit, I started freaking out, man.  I'm going to get pulled over.  I'm going to be on the 8 o'clock news.  And I saw all these things, right?  Inter-Hot story.  Did you say the 8 o'clock news?  So I'm driving back, and then all of a sudden, my mom.  8 o'clock news.  That'll make New York one, maybe.  I don't know what you're saying. 
[02:06:00]  So I'm driving back.  My mom starts calling me, and I said, and then she picks up.  And as soon as I spoke, my mom was like, you're fucking drunk.  And I said, I have to concentrate now.  And he's driving on the phone, by the way.  By the way, he just pulled his phone out of his pocket and talked into it as a prop on radio.  Yeah, so starting up, when I got home, I finally got home, and I get out of the car,  and it was one of those things I just walked slowly.  Jalapeno on top.  Jalapeno, yeah.  Anyway, so what happened?  So I go, and I laid on my bed, and I'm like, you're standing. 
[02:06:30]  I couldn't believe I just drove, like, for an hour and 45 minutes.  Crazy.  And I made it.  I made it alive.  And you know what?  In all honesty, I don't encourage this kind of behavior.  Well, that's good.  And then when I got home, my brother showed up with, like, a 12-pack of St. Paul's beer,  and we just continued to party.  But what happened?  And the lesson here was I wasn't drunk.  I was just super freaking hyper on the energy drinks.  Is that what the whole story is about?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  That's an amazing...  I thought you were going to sing Silent Night. 
[02:07:00]  I'm exhausted and sweating.  No.  Like, I feel like I just drank all that shit.  I was doing that.  You tell a story, and you put people in it.  I feel like I was in an action movie.  Oh, okay.  Cool.  Well, you know what happened Friday?  Freaking...  What happened Friday?  Well, it was Saturday morning.  Vinny's just back there worried.  It was 2 o'clock in the morning.  Hey, oh.  A friend calls me up, 2.30 in the morning.  So I pick up the phone and, what's up?  I had been drinking with him earlier that night, right?  And he was like, dude, I'm fucking on the side of the road, man. 
[02:07:30]  I veered off.  I hit something.  And I'm like, oh, what do you want me to do?  He was like, yo, come here and tow me out, man.  Help me out.  So sure enough, I leave, right?  So I got there to the scene.  I mean, I did have some beers earlier.  Ah, yeah.  Of course.  So what happened was that I go there.  I get there.  And yeah, sure enough, the freaking bumper's off.  The radiator's busted.  The freaking oil pan is all ripped.  And it was just...  Oh, it was horrendous.  Fucked up.  So I showed up, and the guy's like, oh, worry.  And he was like, yeah, he just got pulled over, like, freaking 10 minutes. 
[02:08:00]  Did the officer say anything?  He's like, no, because, you know, he just told me to go home.  So sure enough.  So I backed my Jeep.  I almost flicked my Jeep over in that little side of the road.  I put the rope, because I didn't have a little winch where to put the rope.  So I put it underneath where the leaf spring was.  The freaking rope got stuck underneath the freaking leaf spring.  Anyways, that's not the point.  So I start pulling out.  I freaking pull out.  He backs up, and, pow, hits me right in the back.  I'm like, what the fuck?  And then what happened, I didn't realize that I had pocket dialed my mom.  So when my mom is listening to this whole thing, oh, hey, is it the car? 
[02:08:30]  Hey, what the fuck?  And then, you know, all these things going.  So my mom starts freaking out, runs up to my brother in this room.  And then, so finally, I call him back.  You know, what's up?  And they say, yeah, my mom was worried because you were driving drunk.  And I'm like, no, no, no.  I'm helping somebody out.  So I pulled the car out.  Wait, what is it again?  Oh, yeah.  So then my friend drives home.  You know, the car is busted completely.  I go back to the house.  My mom was having a heart attack.  And then, so my brother was there, and he was looking for me. 
[02:09:00]  And she's like, no, don't worry about it.  So we got there.  We finally made it home safe and everything.  And I drank, like, nine beers after that because I couldn't go back to sleep.  And that was Friday.  Yeah, it was Saturday morning.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  It's impressive.  Anyways, I think Oscar should take Silent Night by himself.  Oh, that's a great idea.  No, we should be singing Smash Mouth.  Yeah.  Sing Silent Night.  It's a break.  Whoa, can I hear it?  Like, I mean, um. 
[02:09:30]  Okay.  Okay, you got it.  Oh, silent night.  Holy night.  All is calm.  All is bright.  Round, young virgin, mother and child, right?  Holy infant.  I don't want to do this.  I don't know.  I suck at it.  I clearly suck. 
[02:10:00]  Wow.  We do it karaoke style, maybe, you know what I'm saying, with a couple beers.  That didn't stop the storytelling.  Sleep in heavenly peace.  Sleep in heavenly peace.  I can't take this.  You're better at this, Sam.  You should be doing this.  I don't have this, man.  Sam's arrangement. 
[02:10:30]  What the hell did I just wake up to?  I don't know.  That's great, right?  Anyways, how about a break?  That's a bad dream.  That's what the listeners are saying.  All right, we'll break.  We got the crew here today, and Vinny from Jersey Shore next, as well.  Stay there.  The government and parents everywhere, they tried to battle.  This is the virus on Sirius XM.  Hey, Joe Bulls.  Merry Christmas.  I'm a nooch.  I heard you saw Janus.  Yeah, my paisan.  Let me tell you what he got me this year.  On the twelfth day of Christmas, my paisan gave to me twelve gobs of hair gel. 
[02:11:00]  Would you watch the hair gel?  Eleven Sinatra CDs.  Ten new hand gestures.  Nine balls a-grabbing.  Eight higher doors.  Seven piazza jerseys.  Six search of the keys.  Five pinky rings.  How do you like me now?  Four fresh ganoles.  Old tree god bodice.  Two guinea teas.  And I'll ride in as I-Rod-Z. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  That's for you, God bless.  Oh, my God.  I forgot about that one.  That's an all.  And that was just the last verse.  That actually went like the 12 days of Christmas and took forever.  It's six minutes long.  Yeah, we got right to the end.  Wow.  Quickly, I was just checking my Twitter, and people were saying that Oscar tells a story like  the end of Goodfellas.  Oh, wow.  Yes.  Very similar, Oscar.  That's a compliment.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah, all right.  And we got Pat from Menaki here, Stalker Patty, Oscar, nervous Oscar, and Bobo just staring 
[02:12:00]  at the space.  I don't know what's up with him today.  With his new beard.  Yeah, he's creeping everybody out.  Yeah.  And we got Vinny from the Jersey Shore outside the studio.  Yes.  Ran into him at the Jets game and said, hey, man, you got to come in and do the show.  Turns out he's a fan of the show.  Come on in.  Come on in.  An actual fan of the show.  Sam's got to be very excited.  Sam is a very big fan.  What's up, Vinny?  How you doing, Vinny?  How you been, man?  Good to see you again, bro.  Yeah. 
[02:12:30]  Take a seat.  Make yourself at home.  Sam's mother made some wonderful Christmas things.  Yeah, man.  We got Christmas cookies in front of you.  Homemade from Sam's mom, Bobby.  Sam's mom, Bobby.  And no one else was allowed to touch them until you had a taste.  Well, we had some.  We had some, of course, because we're the big stars.  I was probably going to have a chocolate chip and fudge or whatever the fuck it is.  They're pretty good, though.  He went for the chocolate chip cookie.  I know.  They are good.  They are pretty good.  I'm bad.  Yeah.  Okay.  See?  Not bad.  They're not too dry, right?  I like moist chocolate chip cookies. 
[02:13:00]  We're going to put these in the microwave for like five seconds.  That's what I said.  Try the fudge or the coconut truffle bowl.  Cookies heat up in fucking the microwave.  A second.  Which is the fudge?  A second.  Which is the fudge?  Which one looks like the fudge?  I don't want them on with that.  I like the chemically enhanced cookies that are always chewy and bendy.  Fudge is pretty good, but I like the ones without the nuts.  I don't like the nuts.  I don't like them either.  No.  Yeah, throw that fucking shit out.  I'm going to leave it here.  Oh, he doesn't like your mom's cookies.  That's a sign he doesn't like them. 
[02:13:30]  Or he's watching his Jersey Shore figure.  Yes, exactly.  She's going to be disappointed.  You think?  Yeah.  She was with you anyway.  Oh, man.  Too many disappointments.  Son, you're still pretty much an intern at this age.  I'm not an intern.  This is our last show before we get out of here for a while, so it's a little loose.  Cool.  It's called phoning it in.  We like to call it phoning it in.  We do have a word for it.  We're not going to go there, but that's okay.  You see the Jets coach there. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  What, when he tripped the guy?  Look at that.  No.  No.  The foot fetish.  Yeah, fucking Ryan and that foot fetish.  You haven't seen the foot fetish story yet?  No, no, no.  It's a good one.  Holy shit.  It's the front page of the paper.  And it's got to be them.  Yeah, play the video.  That's possibly Rex Ryan's wife, and she is starring in a foot fetish video with Rex Ryan  as the cameraman.  Get out of here.  Videotaping it.  Yeah.  Saying like, yeah, those feet are soft.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's so creepy.  And his puddle of AIDS is up.  It's really soft.  We should get him on the phone, because I think he has more info. 
[02:14:30]  But here's the video.  Make it here.  It's his voice.  Yeah.  Hmm.  That's pretty creepy.  That's his wife.  I don't understand what can be so appealing about someone's feet.  You're not a foot guy, right?  Nah.  Not at all.  I say part of the whole package, it's fine.  You don't want a girl with no feet.  And then you don't want a girl with like, I don't like Paris Hilton feet either, because 
[02:15:00]  they're like fucking talons.  Yeah, the talons and shit.  But if they're appropriate with the rest of the body, it's like a neck.  You don't want a long neck.  Then you don't want a chicken no neck.  What are they showing off with those ten toes?  Is that his wife or something?  Yeah, supposedly his wife.  They're not brave enough to say it actually is.  They're calling it a Rex wife lookalike right now.  You look at a picture.  They're a little scared.  It's his wife.  She's wearing green.  To go all in.  Yeah, it's green.  Right.  So that's our coach.  Nice. 
[02:15:30]  Making a foot fetish video.  Just a time for the playoffs.  Hopefully the playoffs.  Everyone's got a little kink to them.  Yeah.  Everyone.  Yeah, I can't blame you.  So are you done?  I'm not one to judge.  Getting laid a lot, of course.  That's how it works.  I'm doing all right.  That's how it works.  Yeah.  You were probably doing that, though, a lot even before the show.  Not really.  Just going down to the shore, fucking around.  No, I was like 21 when I went to the show, so I was never old enough to go.  I used to sneak in to a couple clubs in Seaside, but yeah, no, the girls, they start  throwing themselves at you mostly once you're on TV.  Yeah. 
[02:16:00]  Right, right?  Yeah.  Shit works.  That knows.  Yeah.  Pat knows.  He does the fucking hot dog eating contest.  Throwing themselves at me, running away, same thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Why don't you tell them about your big TV show out there, Pat?  It's just as big as Jersey Shore.  Come on.  Yeah.  What show's that?  It's a Nathan's hot dog eating contest.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've been there, like, well, two years ago, because I've failed the last two years.  Well, you've failed eating enough.  Yes.  Yeah.  I know.  Jersey, though.  How many did you eat?  Uh, I can only eat 30 in 10 minutes. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, that's it?  Winner eats, yeah, 68, so.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a big drop-off after the first couple.  That sucks.  That's unbelievable.  Yeah.  I don't know how they do that shit.  That's crazy.  Diabetes kind of slows me down.  It's a little speed bump.  He lost a toe to diabetes, man.  Why didn't lose it?  The doctor took it.  Oscar likes that.  Oscar likes that.  Wow.  Now, Vinny, at this point, you turn around to see, uh, that's nervous Oscar.  He's a fucking mess.  Hey, guys.  He might be a Coke dealer.  We're not really sure. 
[02:17:00]  And then we got Bobo.  Hey.  And then we got Stalker Patty.  Bobo's just...  Hi, Stalker Patty.  Now, Stalker Patty, here's a little history for you there, Vinny.  Okay.  When me and Ed, uh, moved back to New York and started working at WNAW, she was at the  station, and she was a true Stalker of our show.  So we said, you know what?  You might as well fucking hang out.  Yeah, no.  Keep your Stalkers close, you know?  I listen to you guys a lot.  Yeah.  Back in the day.  Oh, you do know who she is?  Yeah.  Back in the day.  And then she used to sleep at the station and all that.  Really?  There were a couple circumstances involving that. 
[02:17:30]  How about a microphone there?  Yeah, we were able to...  You've only been doing this a thousand years.  We were able to get her housing at the radio station for a while, which was good.  I've seen a video, I don't know if I should bring it up, of her that you guys did over  here.  Which one?  Take the wig?  The Bukkake one.  Oh, the Bukkake one.  Oh, the Bukkake one.  We see that as a good one.  Homemade Bukkake video.  Remember the memories, Patty, right?  Yeah, I do.  I actually saw a video of it.  Patty, you're a trooper.  That voice.  Thank you.  What if one of the guys were to bring a girl like Patty back to the house? 
[02:18:00]  I think I had.  Her name.  I'd get quite an education.  Oh, yeah, you would.  Patty, she's 55, you said today?  55.  Yes.  55 birthday.  55-year-old virgin.  You look great.  Thank you.  You want Vinny to pop your old cherry or what?  No.  Do you know how famous you'd be if Vinny fucked you?  It wouldn't pop.  It would just disintegrate.  Vinny just goes, yeah.  Yeah, that's...  It's not enough.  Where do you live?  You live in Staten Island, right?  Yes, I do.  Yeah, me too. 
[02:18:30]  Mostly, yeah.  Hey, baby, you guys go out on a little date.  Thanks, guys.  You could go to the mall.  Setting Vinny up on a date with Stalker Patty.  Thanks, guys.  I don't know what else is there.  The paparazzi are going to follow you around, Patty.  It's good for your image.  You could sit in Verrazano traffic while she fucking gives you a handy.  Vinny, there's not enough fucking...  The fudge is repeating on me.  There's not enough beer in the world, is there?  No.  No.  She's a nice-looking lady. 
[02:19:00]  Ah, I like that.  You're in Hollywood already.  Holy shit.  Yeah, he can't say anything wrong.  No one's Hollywood enough to not look at Patty.  All right, that's what I want to hear.  I'm just nice, you know?  Ah, yeah.  She's not a grenade.  She's a landmine.  Fucking A-bomb.  Bobo, do you watch Jersey Shore?  Yeah.  How about a mic there, Bobo?  And there's a question I want to ask.  How much beer do you think I would need if I were to invite Shnooki to my house?  Shnooki.  Shnooki?  Like a schnauzer.  She made a name. 
[02:19:30]  I don't know.  She makes a name for herself.  I gotta tell you that.  Do you think she's attractive?  Yeah, I think she is.  Yeah, so you wouldn't need that much.  I think you guys would make a good couple, you know, with that.  I hear that a lot.  Yeah.  Bobo's not a meathead, though.  A juice bag, a juice bag.  A juice bag.  A juice box.  You gotta start doing steroids, Bobo.  You think you can get some steroids?  Ask Oscar.  I'm sure he can find them.  Oscar, get you anything. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, let's give me a couple hours.  That freaking luggage store is a front.  He's wheeling fucking suitcases of drugs and money in and out that place.  You are from Columbia, right?  Yes, sir.  So you know the trade.  You watch Jersey Shore, Oscar?  I've seen half an episode.  What?  No, it's because I just don't have time, man.  He saw half an episode, Vinny.  Yeah, yeah.  He don't have time.  Oh, you saw half an episode?  Yeah, it was.  Which one?  I remember, man.  I was drunk when I saw it. 
[02:20:30]  Fair enough.  How can I argue with that?  I can argue with that.  Do you know any of the Jersey Shore people, though?  Just by seeing their faces pop up?  Probably the most snooking situation.  Are you forced to drink more than you want to?  Or are you fine with anything?  Because when you go out to gigs, I'm sure you're fucking pounding shit.  Well, the gigs is that when you're on the show, I literally drink a lot because there's nothing else to do.  You know what I mean?  I hear you.  You know, it's like, they don't force you to do anything, but you, what else are you going to do? 
[02:21:00]  You know what I'm saying?  It's like...  You wake up, you start walking around, you look around and go, ah, I might as well have a drink.  Exactly.  But when you do the gigs, like the club appearances, I kind of tone it down.  Because how much can I...  You know what I mean?  I'm on the road and stuff.  And everybody wants to buy you drinks.  Everybody.  I got to start faking it, putting water.  Like, they give me water and like...  I've done that before where you do water shots instead of shots.  And you're like, oh.  So I've also done shots where I take a shot and then I make it like I'm chasing it with my beer.  And you spit it back in.  I spit it back out of my beer.  I just put the whole shebang on the bar, get a new beer.  Because I'd end up fucking on the floor. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  How much fucking, you know what I mean, can one person drink?  Like, I don't want to be a pussy or anything.  But you can't...  Pat?  Pat?  Pat?  Is it eggnog?  Oh, yeah.  The, uh...  I was at Foxwoods, uh, this past weekend.  He wanted to play.  But Vinny had to do it.  It was fucking...  Yeah, I wanted to play.  It went really well.  Yeah.  And then I was playing blackjack and the listener's just like, man, they keep hitting me with...  And before I knew it, I was so fucking hammered. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  And it just ruins the next day.  I'm hung over with a rag on my head.  Ugh, fucking hit it.  And then if you say no, you're a douchebag.  Then you know...  You know, Anthony says he drinks.  He's a faggot.  Oh, there goes Patty.  What's that?  Patty.  Looking at a naked Patty.  With a bag around her with her red socks on.  And a bag over her head.  Oh, God.  That's humiliating.  There are guys that would tag that.  Hell yeah.  Half my family.  Yeah. 
[02:22:30]  And she's got...  What is that?  A bag on her head?  A bag over her head.  What bit was this?  Young known virgin.  Just in case she had a tad of dignity left.  Yeah.  The bag went on her head.  Wait, what does she do here?  She has to grab as much money as she can in as short a time.  That was boring.  Very nice to her that day.  What happened to the mousetraps and honey?  I think we dumped shit on her after this.  Oh, was this the setup to just fuck her up?  I don't know.  The Bukkake video is gone.  Yeah, she's picking it up.  We just stopped.  Yeah, we're mousetraps.  I see them.  Oh, do you?  In your sleep?  Oh, she's putting it up her snatch. 
[02:23:00]  Were you putting that up your snatch?  I don't know what I was...  It was called the money snatch.  The good old days.  Women were allowed to pick up as much money as possible, Vinny, but they had to put it  in their snatch.  So they'd roll it up real tight.  Real tight.  Pop it in there.  Were they singles?  Were they like dollars?  Like some of them were 20s, some hundreds.  Mostly singles.  A lot of singles.  Yeah, you want that strip of money.  How much money did you make?  I don't remember.  A couple hundred.  Whatever.  Oh, here she is in the mousetraps. 
[02:23:30]  Just before we made her take her clothes off or anything?  I guess.  Now she's blindfolded, right?  This is CBS, so we probably couldn't.  Oh, my God.  I set one off.  I hit it from the side.  It jumped up.  That I remember.  Something went right in my face.  Snap like that.  Yeah, of course.  It was Jimmy's cock.  And then you can't see it.  All right.  Vinny, season three of Jersey Shore starts, what, in January?  January 6th, yeah.  Yeah.  Very soon.  Will there be a fourth? 
[02:24:00]  Um, I don't know.  You know, there's always like, we've done three of them so far, and there's always like, I'm  sure you guys can relate.  There's always like this weird, when one of them ends is like this weird feeling you get  before, where you kind of feel like it's going to happen, but you don't know yet.  And then you're like, oh, shit.  And when they start talking to each other, like agents and managers and shit, they start  going like, oh, I'm done with this.  They're going to fuck this up for me.  Yeah, exactly.  You never know until you're actually in, like, every time I've done it, I never knew until  I was actually there, like, this shit is really happening.  Did you think they were going to, like, just, like, the real world, change the cast and 
[02:24:30]  just keep the whole fucking thing going?  Yeah, I mean, original, no, actually, when we first did it, we didn't know what we were  like, we were sitting in the house like, yo, these people are going to like, because  like, you know that show, uh, is she really going out with him?  I don't know if you've ever seen it.  It's just totally rips the guys apart, especially the guys from Jersey, like this tool bag, you  know, like, you know, we didn't know, like, you know, we'd know if it was like a one episode  thing or like, uh, you know, two episodes, like the true life kind of thing, not, we had 
[02:25:00]  no idea until like three months after we filmed, they're like, yeah, it's going to be like  a big thing, a big series, whatever.  And then, um, after we filmed the first one though, we knew that they weren't going to replace  the cast. I mean, it's just, it's just not that type of show, you know what I'm saying?  Like the real world is different. It's like people from all over the country. That's  interchangeable. This one is like a specific group of kids from a certain, a place, you  know, certainly. Yeah. Special personalities grabbed hold of that. Look how he's selling  that though. I don't want to be replaced. Yeah. Fuck that. Yeah. I mean, it would just be 
[02:25:30]  a different show. My theory is that they replace you guys one by one. Exactly. And then  it keeps it going a little bit with a little fresh blood because Snooki's friends  involved like fog hat. They just replace a few members of the band. And before you  know it, the whole band's in their twenties. No, cause Snooki's real friend is a part of  a season three, right? Ryder. No, no, no, no. Not Ryder. Ryder. He knows. But you  know nothing. Yeah. I know Ryder. You know Ryder. You like Ryder? Jesus. Yeah. Ryder visited  Snooki in Miami. I saw that. Yeah. And she looks like she likes girls. That Ryder. I am. 
[02:26:00]  And Snooki likes just anything that fucking leaves. They all like girls nowadays. Yeah.  Yeah. Girls just like girls. Yeah. It's beautiful. It's a great time to be alive.  I've become a lesbian. I like girls. Season three, season three, you guys go back to the  Jersey Shore. Then, I mean, I'm trying to think what they could do for season four.  If it's something like the first formula, maybe, you know, somewhere like the, we went  to Miami because it was cold here. You know what I'm saying? So somewhere where we're escaping  the cold. But like I said. Yeah, you guys need warm weather. Yeah, exactly. That's where 
[02:26:30]  the magic happens. Of course. Yeah. Well, why don't you twist it and go into some fucking  miserable place like Buffalo? Yeah, that's true. What the fuck are I going to do all bundled  up and go to Buffalo for the winter? Yeah. I just got back from there. This place is pretty  depressing. It is the most depressing fucking place on the planet. People are great, but  that fucking weather will just make you cry. Horrible. Yeah. But they drink a lot, you  know, to get, you know. Of course. Yeah, yeah. Alcoholism rate has to be huge up there, right? 
[02:27:00]  Black gold was the drink, man. Really? They were drinking Crown. A little Crown, actually.  Yeah. Trying to have some class. Yeah, I guess. Oh, you went to the real places. Yeah. I was  down and dirty when I was in that town. I didn't go to no real fucking clubs or nothing.  No, the alcohol is cheap up there. Everything. Everything's cheap. Yeah, because who the fuck  wants the little snow? Winds, booze, and a lot of fucking snow. Awful. Awful. What did the family  think? Were they just kind of like, oh, this is a great little hobby that you have once you  get, fall back on a trade, get into construction? Well, I graduated college, so that was like 
[02:27:30]  the foundation, so as long as I got that out of the way. So as long as you did that, you  could. Yeah, you know, you can dabble into different things. Play a kowtow to your whimsy.  And I mean, yeah, they knew I was always into like, I did acting when I was a kid. So now  like my parents, my family's like old school Italian, so they don't know the. No shit.  Yeah. I was like, yeah. So they can't like tell the difference. Like you're on TV, you're  on TV. That's what they thought I was doing, you know. Right, right. Meanwhile, I know that 
[02:28:00]  it's reality TV is not acting, you know what I mean? It has nothing to do with that.  Some people may act on reality TV, but it's two different things. True acting, right.  Yeah. So they kind of thought it was that. And then like until they really started watching  it, they realized what it was and, you know, get a couple like, oh shit moments. But for  the most part, they're pretty proud. But did they realize like how big it was and  or was it until people started coming up to you in front of them that they were  like, oh, I guess this really is something. Yeah. My parents caught on quick, but like  I, I really have some like old school off the bat, off the bat, off the boat 
[02:28:30]  Italians who like it now they're finally getting it. Like when my grandmother just  went to Italy, she just got back and she saw me in the newspaper over there and she  saw me on TV over there. She's like, oh shit, what the fuck? Probably thought you  whacked a fucking cop out and had to go hide out. So yeah, now they're catching  on to it. But relatives have a way of not understanding. You talk about it all the  time. Oh yeah. Where your mom thinks you're doing a cute little radio show for a few  people. For years. Because I was, I was doing, you know, construction for so many 
[02:29:00]  years that when I got into radio, my, my entire family was pretty much like, oh boy,  here he goes with one of these harebrained schemes. And obviously at the beginning  they could think that because there were a few before that. Uh, but after a while,  you know, a couple of years go by and I'm making a good living. I'm actually driving  by in a, a new car and I have money to actually pay for stuff. And they're still  like, do you have, you know, you could still fall back on, on the construction,  right? Oh yeah. Like, yeah, don't worry about it. By the way, you know, the ratings  it's, oh, I don't know what it, any of that means. Exactly. They probably think if you're not a 
[02:29:30]  mason building something, you're not working on it. Exactly. Yeah. Italians, it's always,  you know, two parts cement. So what can you tell us about season three? She gets a motion  out there. Uh, they, they, they just released a two minute official trailer. Oh, did you  guys see it yet? A sizzle reel. Oh, you guys can watch it. Rich Voss calls it a sizzle reel.  I thought that was a foot fetish thing. It was a sizzle reel. We should go to MTV.com. I don't  know if that's where the official one is. Nice. Look at you plugging the, Oh, my 
[02:30:00]  company, man. I want to guess what we're about to see. I think we're going to see a lot of  drinking and a few fights and a lot of making out. I wonder if Tommy Cheeseballs is kicking  himself these days. Oh, the guy. Yeah. The original, the original guy. Is he the peak best of the  Jersey Shore? Yeah. Yeah. Who was he? He did the, uh, the true life thing. Jersey Shore. But 
[02:30:30]  he was, he was an older guy. Yeah. What's he going to do? Situation's a little bit on  the older side too, isn't he? Uh, they're, they're around 30 years old, but he's got,  he's got some heat. So he'll last another couple of seasons. Mikey was cool. He came  in here. We ended up liking Mike. So, uh, any, uh, any problems with the cast that aren't  on the show? Like just personal kind of, eh, it's personal. Did they try and get Angela  back again? You don't even have to say who or anything, but I mean, it's the same thing  with any, you know, you have your work friends and you have your real friends. Some of them 
[02:31:00]  are just people that are literally acquaintances. Some people are, some people are assholes.  Some people are taking themselves a little too seriously. Okay. I get it. Is Angela part  of season three? Uh, no. Fuck. They got to bring her back for the fight just to annoy. Trust  me. There's enough drama. No one wanted that really that bad. Yeah. All right. Let's see  this. Was this it? I don't know. I got it. Fucking commercial. Oh, I'm sorry. Target's  having a sale. Ryan Seacrest and Nick Cannon at Disney World. Everyone. Oscar, get your 
[02:31:30]  Jersey Shore question ready. Okay. Oh, I have one in the back pocket. He pulled one out of  his back pocket. Oh, damn. I wasted my question. Oscar, what's your question for Vinny from the  Jersey Shore? How do I, how do I manage not to go into the friend zone when I approach  a girl? Oh, that's a good question. The friend zone. Yeah. Cause that's what I see  it right into. Yeah. I'm, I'm pretty much not. I just go with the feeling. You know what 
[02:32:00]  I'm saying? Like if, if that's what it is and you just got to accept it, that's what  it is. You know what I'm saying? If she wants to bang you, then she will. That's, that's  pretty good. You know what the thing is? Here's the trick. That's my problem. Here's the trick  about not getting stuck in the friend zone. The friend zone is like the fucking atmosphere  of the earth. You got to get through that shit fast. Exactly. You got to get through  it. So you could use what would normally get you stuck in the friend zone to like get together  with this girl and show what we have in common. This is cool, but blast through it and don't  dwell there or else you'll get stuck in the friend zone. Get through it, get the shit out 
[02:32:30]  that we are compatible and then start making some moves to get out of there. When you don't,  when you don't get a lot of like, no offense, but like if you don't get a lot of the girls,  like, no, no, I'm not saying him. I'm just saying people in general. Like, and you find  me, he means me. And you find that one, like, you know, you just put so much like she can  tell you trying, they sense that. Trying too hard. You know, if you're a guy that gets girls  all the time, like you just, are you right? Is this going to happen? Are we just going to  be friends? And like, you're ready to move on. And then they're like, no, no, no, I want  it. You know what I mean? So there's a difference between handing her flowers and wanting to 
[02:33:00]  go to the museum. And then, uh, like Jay Moore pulling his dick out and going, what are we  going to do about this? Sure. Yeah, there's a gray area. That's a gray area. The situation  was, uh, doing a hard sell. Oh, was he? Yeah. Yeah. Come on, honey. She was like, putting  on pajamas. Come on, honey. You gotta go. You gotta go. Come on, honey. But you gotta be  careful with that too, because, you know, that could blow up. Yeah, he was a cop block in  there. Let's go to Oscar again. You get a tough time getting women. Well, see, this is the  thing. I keep getting a lot of advice. The guys are like, you have to be an asshole, man, 
[02:33:30]  cause girls like that. So the other day I'm in photography class. I kick a girl in the  con. So what happened is girl goes up to me. It's like, Oh my God, what am I doing with  my final project? I didn't get like the mountain, uh, board for the photography. And I said, well,  and I was like, we're going to be an ass. I was like, well, I have two. I'll have little  two boards. I can sell for you for four bucks. You know, trying my way of being an asshole.  And I'm like, Oh, okay. And she didn't have any money. An asshole isn't shaking her down  for money. That is it. They mean bad boy asshole. If that's what, you know, what you sense in 
[02:34:00]  a girl, but you asking her for money. What the fuck are you? You got to degrade her. No,  dude, I think so much. Oh, that's not degrading. You're just asking for four bucks. Yeah. Well,  it was expensive board, man. So I was like, man, I just can't give a hand. Fucking photo mounting  board, like mat boards. Your move is selling mat boards to girls. If you can't afford a  board, she's probably not going to like you. No, I mean, you can't just toss it to her. 
[02:34:30]  I want to know how it worked out. So you were nasty. So then later, I guess she sat down  with this other guy and then she commented, commented about what happened. And then so  he goes, Hey Oscar, come here. And I said, what's up? You were charging her $4 for the mat  board. It was like, well, listen, this is the thing. I paid $4 per cut on that  freaking board. And, and if you're not going to use it, I'll use it. That's what I said.  So I just, and I just left. So he wound up with the girl. Uh, no, I think she has a 
[02:35:00]  boyfriend. Oscar is the greatest. Call MTV. Bobo, you got a question for Vinny? Bobo, are  you on fucking medication today? What are you taking today? No, obviously it's not Adderall.  No, no, it was just last night. The Benadryl I had to take last night. I was sneezing a  lot last night. With all night sneezing. You got a question for Jersey Shore of his video 
[02:35:30]  here. I asked the question already early. He blew his question load. But you have anything  with, we're talking about girls and boozing and what do you got? This guy's a, he knows  his way around. He knows his way around. He knows his way around. Well, yeah. A little  advice, maybe? Well, yeah, there, there is a chick I'd like to say hi to. Lauren at the,  Lauren at Stop and Shop. Actually, she looks, she looks pretty great. I mean, I. Yeah. Is 
[02:36:00]  she a cashier or a shelf stocker or a customer service? Well, what, what? Yeah, I guess.  Sorry. She, she's a cashier. Ah. All right. What's your move, Bobo? To try to like, maybe  make a move and then we can see what Vinny thinks. Well, what it is is I like her and she,  she recently, I didn't realize that she knew who I was, but she, she know all of a sudden  not that many months ago. Yeah, I bet all of a sudden she knows. You know that guy Bobo  that comes in? Stay away from him. No, no. I noticed on Facebook, she, she added me on Facebook 
[02:36:30]  and I noticed, I said, wait a minute. I recognize her at Stop and Shop. Stop and Shop. And there  was a message that she knew who I, she knew who I was. Oh, that's awesome. Who is that  outside? So what are you going to, you got to capitalize on that out myself. What happened?  Who is that outside? Some cute girl. Bring, bring her in here. Damn. Who's that? I don't  know. Is this the girl from Shop, right? She must have saw me. Is she from Stop and Shop?  Stop and Shop. You're the girl from Stop and Shop? Oh. Hi, hi. No, hi. Hi. Who are you? Wait, who are 
[02:37:00]  you? Wait, you guys all know who this is? No.  I used to intern with Hits1 before. Oh, an intern? Yes. You can leave. Yeah, we're  not allowed to intern. I'm kidding, of course. So you interned with Hits1? Yes, I did.  So, so you know her, Sam? No, how long ago? I interned with Hits1 last summer and with  B-Knock the semester before that. So now what are you doing? I'm just visiting today. Oh,  yeah? Just hanging around? Yes. Hi, Vinny. Nice to meet you. What's your name? Kenya. 
[02:37:30]  Kenya. Nice to meet you. Wow. Oh, all right, guys. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry, stalker  Patty. Look how that shit works, man. He just upgraded. She walked by, she looked in the  window. It's like window shopping. Kenya. Kenya. I'm sorry. My girlfriend's sitting right  there. Yeah, that Jersey Shore put some years on you. She's only 23. She got a lot of sun.  Then he just upgraded Kobe beef. Oh, shit. The oceans eroded her. Damn. So you watch the 
[02:38:00]  show? Uh, I don't. Well, no, I mean, I don't mean this show. I mean Jersey Shore. Of course  you do. I know you don't know us from a hole in the fire. That's fucking nuts, bro. Holy shit.  Yes, I have on the show. Oh, thank you. So what, you got any questions? I'm sure you've...  It's so funny. How can you be so sweet? You're the best. Who, me? Oh, thank you. Oh, damn.  Look at this. They throw themselves at him. This is ridiculous. I hope she misses. Damn. 
[02:38:30]  When she throws herself at him. Oh, yeah, yeah. You're playing backstop there. And Vinny's  niceness gets, you know, come on. No, I think he's a sweetheart. His niceness gets some numbers.  I think he's a sweetheart, but you got a boyfriend? I don't. You don't? What do you like doing?  Um, I like dancing. You go out, you go dancing. How old are you? I'm 22. Oh, I'm 23. What  kind of dancing do you do? I like dancing all types of music. You do a little booty? Are  you Spanish? I am Spanish. What kind? A Dominican? Oh, they dance the best. Yeah, Dominican

Whatever you want to  say. Vinny wants to see this. He told me. Oh, yeah. Just say it's great. Vinny told me.  Put that. I think we got to put some headphones on, right? Oh, she'll hear it. What are we  at? A hockey game? Jesus. Okay, what am I dancing to? I don't know. The Dominican girls  just know how to dance. She doesn't dance at techno. I know. Yeah, this is shit. You got

The best way to dance with these women, you've  got to be right behind them. Right behind them. And then you just follow the... She's  showing me. And then you just follow them. Oh, she goes live.

And then you can stand there. Yeah, then just stand there. And she'll do all the work.  Put your hands behind me. Put your hands behind me. Put your hands behind your back?

What? Right. There was no bulge. We understand. Yeah. Oh, my God. You might want  to look up a video online. What a bunch of fucking degenerates. Yeah. That was 
[02:44:00]  awesome. That was awesome. I love getting these guys. You know what I mean? He looked  like he was having a convulsion, though, but that wasn't much of a dance. Oscar's  parped Oscar. Oh, yeah. You feel like a different man, aren't you? Oh, absolutely, man. I had  a coffee on the way here. Yeah. And I just had, like, a freaking Sprite. Yeah. It was  good for me. What do you want to ask? You're a mad man. What do you want to ask? Are you  both Colombian? You're Colombian. No, I'm Colombian. Dominican, right? Dominican. I'm sorry. Oh, that's  cool. I was actually looking into real estate yesterday in Dominican Republic. What? Yeah,  yeah. I saw a couple of nice houses with, like, 40 grand. I was like, oh, man, right by 
[02:44:30]  the beach. Absolutely. That's awesome. You're like, oh, I'll bet you like seafood, right?  A little bit. Oh, a little bit? I bet you like seafood. You like sushi? That's kind of  insulting. Yeah. I know, right? What's that supposed to say? Oh, no, no, no. I mean, no  respect or anything. I just, I don't know. Yeah. The other day I was telling this girl, I was  like, she asked me if what I like for breakfast. And I said, uh, shrimp scampi pizza. And she was like, ew. And I was like,  what? You don't like freaking shrimp? For breakfast? Yeah. No, it's delicious, though. I  mean, do you speak Spanish? Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, fluently. Was she Dominican? Can you 
[02:45:00]  speak Spanish? Yes, I can. Can you speak Spanish to him? Yeah, have a little, have a  little conversation. Have a conversation. It's so sexy. Just a little conversation.  ¿Cómo estás? No bien, bien. ¿Y qué más? ¿Y qué te gusta comer para desayuno?  I love that. Yeah, I love that. Oh, my fucking wallet's gone. What the shit? That was so fast.  In Spanish. No, no. No sé qué decir. No, está todo bien, mami. Tell me, tu mamas unas...  He sounds like those, like, when they dub it over in Spanish. Yeah, he's having a conversation. 
[02:45:30]  Fantastico. It's a Jersey Shore dub. Frosty Place. Frosty Place. Are you, like, in school  or something? No, no. City Field. I just graduated from University in May. Oh, nice. Yeah.  Do you live in the Bronx? I went to the Lincoln Center campus, right around here. It's not  too far from here. Oh, okay. But do you live in the Bronx? No, I live in Manhattan.  Oh, okay. Oh, damn. Uptown. Uptown. Uptown. How far Uptown?  Um, 122nd. Oh, you're right there by the Mason-Dixon line. Yeah, you're right. 
[02:46:00]  Right, I hear you. You're right at the cutoff. Right at the DMZ. That's the Mason-Diaz line.  38th parallel. About 125, 126 tops. Yeah, that's about it. That's about it for us.  As far as my car goes. We're too wide to go any further. Yeah. I usually like bringing  extra ammo when I go home. Right on the border. We could drop you home. You're fucking cool,  man. Get a little spin, because there's something about Dominican, uh, yeah, look at that, right? 
[02:46:30]  Amazing. Automatic. Where does that extra come from? God. Where does that extra come from?  Plantains? Plantains.  No, because they had the Spanish guys, they had it right. You know what I mean? They always,  through history, they always wanted the girls with the big asses, and they just kept banging  them and producing. Producing more. I hear Jimmy the Greek rat coming up. You know what I'm  saying? Controversial comments from the Jersey Shore on Dominicans. It was a compliment. 
[02:47:00]  But it's true. It is a compliment. Hey, would you go out with Vinny today? Would I? Yeah.  Of course. I mean, only if he invited me out. Oh, yeah. He's probably busy on a press  junket. No. Unless I'm cock blocking. I would take her out. Oh, wow. You're making me blush.  Thank you. You're making me blush. You're making a blush. She's turning purple. Yeah, I'm so  proud to blush. Damn. Thank you for having me here, guys. Oh, no problem. Oh, what about 
[02:47:30]  Oscar? I'm a backup. I mean, he's not available. Yeah. That's quite the drop-off there. No  insult there, but. Oh, no, no, no. I mean, it's all good. What do you think of Oscar? Charming.  What, are you trying Jedi mind tricks on him? Uh, I'm charming. Oscar is so fucking horny,  man. Oh, wait. No, no, no. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Vinny, it's not the guinea you were looking  for it. No, but I, I mean, I find other activities besides being horny, you know, like, bunch of 
[02:48:00]  boys. Besides. Holy shit, man. Well, Oscar, offer something and then let her choose. Yeah.  What do you got? What do you got? You want, you want to go for a beer afterwards? I know  there's a English pub around the corner. Dominican girls don't drink beer. Nah. Nah. Look at  this. He knows the whole deal. He goes, Dominican girls don't drink beer. You don't drink beer?  Um, not as much, no. Yeah. I mean, I. But when she does, it's Dos Equis. What do you  like? Coronas. Let's say. Coronas, tequila. Actually, I would say Corona, but I kind of 
[02:48:30]  like Bud Light. Do you drink Patron? Bud Light. Patron, yes. You like some Patron?  Bud Light tap. Yeah. Oh, I got Bud Light and Guinness tap in my bar down at my house at the  compound and a movie theater. What are you doing later? Oscar's going to be over. Oscar  to Pat from Monaco. That's good. What are you doing later? Oscar says, fuck this. I want  to see the movie theater. No. He said keyword Guinness. What are you doing with you then? 
[02:49:00]  Fucking Oscar rules. Holy shit. That's funny, man. Stalker Pat, you got anything to add to  this mess? Oh, please. Oh. I don't know. I don't have TV at home, but I do watch it at my  friend's house sometimes. Oh, my show? It's entertaining. Oh, my show? The bar fights  are interesting. You got a question for her? Every time I look at the show, someone's always  fighting in the bar. I like that. Wait, if you're in a bar and you see a fight, you're  fucking watching. Exactly. It's interesting. That's what people like seeing. Yeah. It is  interesting. You got a question for Vivi? But is it really for real, though, that Snooki really 
[02:49:30]  get hit? Or was it just an act? No, it was 100% real. It was actually her on the green  screen. Right. Yes. And she. Wow. That's the worst question ever. That is. Everyone knew  that was real. My favorite part is when Vinny's waiting for Ramona. I just want to give  him a hug. Oh, come on. Give him a hug. Give him a hug right now. Come on. Give him a hug.  Yeah. Oh, Jesus. She wouldn't stand him up. Oh, man. Ramona was Vinny's. No, right?  Vinny's girl down in Miami. Oh, flowers and everything. Oh, shit. Holy shit. Does this  guy work it? Oh, my God. Vinny, how much pussy did that scene get you? A lot, a lot. I'm 
[02:50:00]  telling you. Scene by scene. I'm telling you. Because he got stood up that day and the  girls must have fucking fell for that. And he was being all sweet and shit. God damn.  Yeah. Ramona. Wait, why don't we just go to Anthony's house? You lying. He's inviting  her for a date at my house. You're the wingman. God damn, Oscar. Oscar is the best, man. 
[02:50:30]  Ramona was the hottest chick in Miami as far as Jersey Shore Girls go. That's really  never really happened to me. And the first time it happened to me was on fucking national  TV, you know? And it had a lot to do with the cameras and shit like that. You know what  I'm saying? It served you well, though. Maybe the second time we'll be on the radio.  Oh. Oscar, you're losing her. You're losing her. Oscar, come on. Jump in there. Do something.  Do something. Flash your abs. You're sweating a bit there now. Yeah, no, no. I'm just getting 
[02:51:00]  nervous. Oh, a little. Go for it. Do you like fast cars? What, are you going to steal  one? No, I just, yeah, I worked on one this summer, so yeah, it's fast. We can go out  raising down English town or something. I can almost get you killed. Nice move. Anyways, back  up, back at the farm. No, thank you. Yeah. Thank you for offering that. Shit, I gotta, 
[02:51:30]  I gotta tweet a picture. Everyone wants a picture. I thought Oscar was offering up  my fucking Mustang. Oh, yeah. I gotta go. It's at Anthony's house. Can we go there? Yeah.  Yeah. Can you two get together so I can tweak this for everybody? Oh, just move the mic.  Move the mic, because everyone wants it. Yeah, get that nasty mic. Oscar, you better get in  there. Oscar, get in there. Look at Oscar. Get in there, Oscar. Oh, there you go.  There you go. There you go. Oh, I got it. I'll take it. Oh, yeah. Look at that picture 
[02:52:00]  she took. Look at the smile she just took. That's why she came in here, for the pictures.  Oh, my God. That's all they want. A lot of pictures. I did not. Opie and Anthony, you  know, who wanted to pick a lot. She worked here and doesn't know who the fuck we are. Hey,  what's your name? Kenya. Kenya? Yes. Is it Kenya or Kenya? It's Kenya. How do you spell  that? Is it spelled like the country in Africa?  It's not. It's K-E-N-I-A. Okay. Kenya. Kenya. Kenya. Ah, I see. K-E-Y? Thank you. K-E. 
[02:52:30]  My name is Somalia. K-E-N-I-A. N-I-A. Nice name. Yeah. Thank you. And, uh, all right.  I did not just want the picture with you. All right. Nah. That's got to be her profile pic  now. How far would you go with Vinny later today? Oh, Jesus. That's a little blunt.  Um. Yeah. That's blunt. No answer to the question. But necessary. Wow. It is necessary.  You can be honest. You'd probably just. Vinny's got numbers. Yeah. No. You just play. Vinny  puts up numbers. I mean, it's the first day. Yeah. Yeah. Girls don't like to. You can't 
[02:53:00]  plan that shit, though. You know what I'm saying? You just gotta. You just gotta. And then  it could just happen. It depends on the chemistry. You could be hanging out at dinner or something  like that, and then you both know it's gonna happen. Exactly. And then you could hang  out at dinner and know, like, holy shit. Once you start thinking it. I gotta get the fuck out  of here. Once you start thinking it, that's when the girl puts her guard up. You know what I mean? Right. They can sense that  like a dog senses fear. Exactly. All right. The picture will be up on my Twitter in a minute.  You can see what she looks like. Nice. And nervous Oscar. Very good. Everyone knows what  Vinny looks like. You know, I started going to church just to meet, like, some really nice 
[02:53:30]  good-looking girls. No, it's incredible, though, like, because I go to Spanish Mass. Yeah,  what happens there? Oh, my God. The girls are, whoa. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm like, I'm trying  to, like, you know, have faith and then the Lord will save me. But I'm like, I can't  think, like, yeah. I'm, like, thinking dirty things. And I'm like, oh, shit. Yeah. I feel  bad. I'm an awful, yeah. But no, no. But it's all good because I'm, like, you know, like,  just redeem myself. You probably go to church, right? Or no? Not anymore. Oh, not anymore?  Oh, shit. What's that about? Yeah, that ended, that ended with one thing she didn't want 
[02:54:00]  to confess. I never got the point of that. I really didn't. Yeah, confession? Yeah.  Not my thing. I don't like it. Plus, you know. I mean, I stopped because of school,  like, college and stuff. I just was too busy. Yeah, college. I bet. Well, a lot of the Dominican  girls I knew, they went to church because, like, they still, that's why I like girls,  exotic girls, because they still keep those, like, traditional values and stuff, you know.  All right, look, you don't have to work your shit here.  You already? Oh, shit.  The hook is firmly set in her mouth. 
[02:54:30]  It's a layup. It's a layup.  I don't know. Nice guy routine doesn't work for me.  I fucking love this guy. Holy shit. That is great, man.  Shit, is that funny? Fucking Vinny.  Nah, man. Holy shit.  He's got it going on. He certainly does. He's fucking pissing.  That is funny. Oscar, I think you're losing this one.  Oh, no, because I'm certainly, yeah.  Huh? Yeah, certainly.  I'm going to crush him right now. You ready?  Yeah.  Can you put your number on my phone? 
[02:55:00]  Oh, damn!  That move!  No, you know what?  I don't want to say it over the air.  Hey, I have a business card.  Oh, here it goes. I have a business card.  He hands on a business card from where he works at the luggage company.  No, no. It's my own. My personal one.  What does it say you do?  Oh, a video and audio design.  He hands on a brand new iPhone.  It's like, yeah, could you bring your number in there?  Wait, here's my phone. Here's my phone.  Wait, wait, wait.  What the fuck is that? 
[02:55:30]  It doesn't want to work.  What is it, a ball-scrolling thing?  What is that, a 1G?  Oh, no.  1G.  His hand is shaking.  I'll keep your car.  Oh!  Don't call me. I'll call you.  Brad and burn.  Brad and burn.  You look like an asshole right now.  Don't call me. I'll call you. 
[02:56:00]  She'll give me her number.  Hello?  Domino's.  I'll tell you, the advent of the phone, where you can just hand a phone to somebody and  have them put the number, is one of the greatest things that's ever happened in dating.  Well, on the show, it's crazy, because we don't have phones.  So we need to, and girls, that's what our thing is.  You know what I mean?  Like, there's nothing else.  There's nothing else.  And we have to get pens and papers and get girls' numbers. 
[02:56:30]  It really, you know.  I got Ronnie in trouble with the book he had.  It had a bunch of numbers in it.  So, yeah, we had to go back.  Oh, shit.  This is the second, by the way, former Hits 1 intern that Oscar is struck out with in  this studio.  Oh, damn.  Oscar, what's up with that?  What is up with that?  That's right.  I forgot about that.  You've got to stop being an asshole, remember?  Oh, no, but I'm Nazi.  I'm bad at it.  You're a Nazi?  No, I'm bad at being an asshole.  I mean, I can't do it.  I can't pull it off.  I got you.  No, I'm too nice, man.  That's the problem.  I'm too nice.  Be yourself.  One girl will appreciate it.  Oh, I'll say that to him. 
[02:57:00]  Maybe a Xanax or two.  Oh, I should.  Actually, you know, I did the psychological, you know, the blood test.  You've got a story about everything.  No, it happened.  I went to psychology class.  Yeah.  And then we started doing this thing where we showed you the picture, you know, with  the blood.  Yeah, sure.  It turns out, like, I was having a, what do you call it, childhood trauma.  I was gay.  I was, yeah, and then I had, like, a messed up childhood, and I was like, ew.  Yo, and it was weird, though, because I went home, and I was thinking about it, and it  was like, oh, my God, maybe this is for real. 
[02:57:30]  I couldn't sleep that night.  I went home.  I freaking, I exercised for, like, two hours, and I never exercised.  So I was just trying to go.  Really?  Yeah.  And I was like, yeah, shit, and I was like, and I was like, and I was just saying, yeah.  Holy Jesus.  So then I told my brother, I'm like, yo, dude, I think I might be psychotic.  I told him.  So, and then I said I should go to the hospital, and you'll check myself in, and tell him that,  listen, I just, I'm not thinking clearly.  I might do something stupid. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, and I went out for a while.  Yeah, well, that's pretty much it.  But anyways, back up to the bar.  You should have him over your house.  Next party.  Not Christmas.  I do karaoke, like, yeah.  Oh, you do karaoke?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can you, do you want to sing karaoke to Kenya?  Uh-uh.  What do you got?  You got Camilo Sesto?  Camilo Sesto, no?  No, I don't.  Well, it's like, you know, Spanish romantic.  Okay.  Can you play a guitar and sing a song for her?  Vinny can't do that shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Go get a guitar.  Vinny can't do that shit.  I have one song.  I can't do that shit.  Oh, man. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, yeah.  But anyway.  Oh, man.  This will one up Vinny right here.  That's right.  Because he can't do this.  You're going to serenade her.  Anthony, by the way, I think Vinny has.  Vinny's just looking around like, yeah.  I think he has an announcement.  You make an announcement on our show, Vinny?  Or you said, fuck it.  Yeah, nah.  I mean, I was just going to have a clothing line coming out.  A clothing line.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  God damn it.  You got a lot of money or what?  God damn it.  You got some fucking great.  You got some money.  Do you have some nice stuff for girls?  Yeah, it's not like the usual.  Can I talk about it?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  I don't know if we're fucking dancing over here again. 
[02:59:00]  No, we'll wait for his guitar.  We'll wait for his guitar.  3X, whatever it is?  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Cool.  I got you.  No, I'm wearing it right now.  It says fuck bullies on it.  Nice.  Because I did a Facebook PSA about all those people committing suicide.  Yeah.  Getting bullied.  Crap.  Yeah, I got 15 million hits on Facebook, my video.  So I just figured I'd keep it going with fashion.  Don't make fun of me because I'm being a nice guy.  No, no.  You're being a nice guy.  I just, with this show, we'd use the same shirt, but with a comma after fuck. 
[02:59:30]  Fuck bullies.  Yeah.  Who cares?  Yeah.  So no, I just like, you know, just to speak like, you know, the youth language.  I'm donating a little bit of the shirt to the charity, too.  Oh, nice.  God damn.  Look at you.  Yeah.  So.  Fucking A.  I'm excited about it.  I can't fucking believe it because I know exactly where you came from.  What are you talking about?  It's just great.  It's like, no, it's fine.  I think it's cool as shit.  Thank you.  But it's like.  Yeah, just exactly.  Just a kid from Staten Island.  Yeah.  Like, I'm going to make money, you know what I mean? 
[03:00:00]  But like, you have to get, I'm like all about karma and shit, you know what I'm saying?  So you have to give and then it keeps coming back.  Yeah.  You might want to leave immediately.  This place is full of bad karma, man.  Holy shit.  All right.  Oh, look at this now.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  I got to, I got to, I got to fucking.  Holy shit.  You guys are going to be nervous.  No, don't get nervous.  This is your last chance.  All right.  Oscar is sitting there with a guitar.  He's got his guitar in hand. 
[03:00:30]  It's all mic'd.  Oh, I've never been serenaded.  Oh, really?  Oh, shit.  This is the day.  Someone tells me your record's still going to be intact after this, too.  Kenya.  Yes?  Nervous Oscar is going to serenade you.  Yes.  Sorry, Vinny.  It's all right.  We'll see what he got.  We'll see what he got.  All right, Oscar.  Holy shit.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Isn't Oscar the one that plays on, like, hard, nasty on his strings?  A lot of aggression.  Hey, girl.  Is he everything you want and ain't a man? 
[03:01:00]  You know I give you the world.  You hand me out the palm of your hand.  So while your love went away, I just can seem to understand.  Throw into me you, babe.  And I was all just ashamed.  But I guess I was for wrong.  Works for Adam Sandler.  Don't want to think about it.  Don't want to talk about it.  I'm just so sick about it.  Can't believe it's ending this way. 
[03:01:30]  I'm just confused about it.  Just don't fool about it.  Tell me, is this fair?  This is the way it's really going down.  Is this how you say goodbye?  Oh, sure, baby, when you came around, that you were going to make me cry.  Now it's breaking my heart.  You won't go around, because I know that you're living a life.  That's what you could be, because when time, you will find.  That's what I'm doing, because I'm wrong, because I'm wrong, because I'm wrong. 
[03:02:00]  System of a Down Syndrome.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was nice.  I loved it.  Damn.  You want Nervous Oscar or Vinny?  Kenny, I'll pick you up at seven.  Nice.  I don't think he was very impressed.  I've never been on a threesome.  Oh.  His last resort.  Threesome.  Threesome.  Threesome.  Threesome.  Threesome.  Yeah, you're looking at it right there on the couch. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, my God.  No.  Patty's on the rotisserie.  Patty's on the rotisserie.  Dude.  First time for everything.  Oh.  Threesome.  I'll give it up to you.  That was good, man.  Yeah, it was.  You do have.  You know what I'm saying?  Thank you.  It was awesome.  That would definitely get girls.  That could if they're real drunk.  I don't think I could change my mind. 
[03:03:00]  Oh.  Yeah, I don't think so.  I don't think you're getting your phone.  I'll sing to you.  I'll sing to you soon.  Yeah.  You got to sing those little slight little songs with a raspy morning voice in her ear.  Yeah.  Yes, those are the sexy ones.  That means you've had a great time.  Oh, shit.  Oscar, you failed with the singing, I think.  Epic fail.  I think because she doesn't know the song.  Oh, she was singing.  Oh, she didn't know that song.  That was a song? 
[03:03:30]  You like Chinese food?  This keeps going out.  I just got a surge of really bad craving for...  You'll hit a food she likes.  I'll split the check with you.  You hear the desperation, I guess, huh?  Yeah.  Is it loud and clear today?  Yeah.  No, it's all good.  I'm seeing somebody.  Oh, you are?  Yeah.  Well, just talking.  Oh, wait.  Stalking.  Who taught you that?  Yeah, make-believe girlfriends.  I don't have a word.  Make-believe girlfriends, so then she wants you.  George Glass. 
[03:04:00]  No, no.  George Glass.  That's George Glass.  She's Dominican as well, too.  Oh, Dominican.  Yeah, yeah.  We're going to go see Megamind, you know, that animation movie.  We're going to go next week.  Next week?  You plan to see a movie a week in advance?  No, no.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's because he never met her yet.  We're all bit.  He still has to meet her, talk to her.  Yeah, he's still looking.  We had coffee the other day.  Coffee?  Yeah, coffee.  I had a Starbucks gift card, and we just went there.  Patty will tell you all about it on your threesome with Bobo. 
[03:04:30]  No, no, thanks.  No?  No, I'm good.  You're not that desperate.  Wow.  Would you have sex with Patty?  Sorry, I can't.  I'm sorry.  Why?  No, I just, I do.  What do you call it?  Wait, we're talking about standards.  You know what?  You must be gay.  We're talking about standards.  No, no.  I mean, all disrespect.  I mean, she has...  I mean, like, white Christmas?  Did you just say all disrespect?  No, no, no.  All disrespect.  All due respect.  I mean, you have a purpose in life, and you want to pursue that.  Why am I going to go in there and abstract it from...  But, Oscar, you weren't sure if you were gay, so...  Oh, no, I'm not gay. 
[03:05:00]  I look gay at all.  But what did the Rorschach test say?  It said you might be gay, remember?  I'm not...  And psychotic.  Yeah, remember that...  Oh, I'm not...  I'm not gay.  I keep telling yourself that.  Seriously.  I'll frickin' jump up a bridge before I...  Oh, jeez.  What's wrong with being gay?  Come on.  Nothing wrong, just that's not my preference, not my cup of tea, no.  But you weren't sure, remember, after taking the test?  I never said that.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, the test.  I just remembered.  See, that's what we were talking about.  Yeah, yeah, that's what we're referencing.  Holy shit.  You don't even remember what I told us.  But did you guys know that, like, a reoccurring dream... 
[03:05:30]  Oh, here we go.  Oh, yes.  What happened?  I keep having this dream...  I'm having a recurring nightmare today.  This is it.  Well, what happened was that I...  In my dream, I kept killing people.  Oh, shit.  No, and it turns out...  And it wasn't a dream.  No, it turns out that I had a...  Either a sexual oppression, a fucked up childhood, or the third one was a trauma or something.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know, but then...  Could be all at once.  What?  Childhood sexual trauma. 
[03:06:00]  Anyways, guys...  Vinny, what's up?  How you doing, bro?  Good.  How you doing?  I don't want to...  I don't want to get the answer to that.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You need an assistant, dude?  I mean, I can handle my drinks.  You know what I mean?  Oh, like a wingman.  You must be a wingman, bro.  A wingman.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A wingman.  So when he totally collapses, the girls will just come right to me.  Exactly.  I don't think you'd make that good a wingman.  He's not going to collapse anytime soon, though.  This guy's got energy.  That's a great wingman, actually.  If you actually have a guy that has zero game possible, that's a great wingman.  So you got him.  Exactly.  What about the deflection factor, though? 
[03:06:30]  If the girl that's staying away from you because he's such an asshole.  Guilt by association.  Right.  Well...  Douchebaggery by association.  Well, he'd have to know to stay back.  Yeah, stay back.  Far enough.  Is she really...  We have a restraining order by proxy.  What?  Yeah, she's a virgin.  She's 55 years old.  It's questionable, though.  We've stuck a lot of things up her pussy and stuff.  We've put a vibrator in her.  She had a finger up her ass and her pussy once.  And then Ron Jeremy put a finger in her once.  And we've had money for U2 tickets. 
[03:07:00]  Dennis Hoff had some fingers in her.  Dennis Hoff had some fingers in her.  Jimmy.  Well, ask Patty.  How many fingers have you had?  Yeah, how many times have you...  I don't know.  I guess the whole hand.  Damn.  And then what about the vibrator?  She was fisted?  We put a little...  Like, one of those little vibrators that go in and you can control it.  And we were controlling it.  And the more sensation we gave her, she was like, no, stop, stop.  Like, she was gonna come.  But she...  Like, didn't...  There's so much guilt in her from her strict religious upbringing.  But there's no human, like, guy-on-girl fornication.  No. 
[03:07:30]  No.  No.  No.  She masturbates.  That never happens.  She masturbates to the edge, though.  Yeah, the edge.  You too.  She likes the edge.  I think he's cute.  Who?  The edge.  The edge.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Sorry, Vinny.  You can't get every girl in the room.  You know, leave some for us.  Holy shit.  Fuck, what a weird day.  It's been great.  I've had fun.  Why don't we actually wrap up and get the fuck out of here and start our vacation?  Not a bad idea.  I don't want to do that. 
[03:08:00]  I know I got some fucking...  Do we do it, Vinny?  ...8,000 more live reads to do.  We did everything you need?  I think so.  You too.  You got season three of Jersey Shore on MTV soon.  New clothing line out?  Yes.  Fuck bullies.  January 3rd.  I'm going to...  I'm on my Twitter page.  I'm going to update people.  So follow me on Twitter.  At Vinny Guadagnino, my long-ass last name.  Goddamn.  Google it.  I already do.  Is that Italian?  Thank you.  No, it's Jewish.  Oscar, you got a Twitter?  No.  She's following him.  She could be following you.  How do you not have a Twitter?  Do you understand?  No, I do have a Twitter, but I only have, like, three twits. 
[03:08:30]  You have a Twitter?  Yeah, but I only have three twits.  Yeah.  Only three.  We're like one big twit.  That's what we were saying when we're sitting on the couch.  Three twits.  What's your Twitter?  Twin Torres.  What?  Twin Torres.  Twin Torres?  Yeah, like twin as in...  With an S, right?  Oh, yes, with an S.  Torres.  T-O-R-R-E-S.  Now you're going to get a lot.  No, because no one knows twin...  No one knows how to spell that.  Twin what?  No, twin?  Like, as in twin?  Twin Brothers?  Yeah.  And then what?  T-O-R-E-S. 
[03:09:00]  T-O-R-E-S.  No, R-R-E-S.  I'm sorry.  R-R.  T-O-R-E-S.  T-O-R-R-E-S.  You can only fit, like, 120 characters in the thing.  I don't think Twitter would work for him.  Justifying it.  This is a fucking story.  Holy shit, right?  He's got a story for everything.  Oh, wait a minute.  And then Friday, I remember me and my friends went, click.  It's just nothing left.  Exactly.  It does unless you're...  Negative numbers.  I want to thank Vinny from the Jersey Shore.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  Come back and see us.  Thanks for coming in, man. 
[03:09:30]  I had a blast.  It's like a dream come true.  Definitely fun, man.  Pat from Menaki, of course.  Stark of Patti, Bobo.  Kenya.  Kenya.  Kenya.  Kenya.  Kenya.  Kenya, I'm sorry.  I'll update you guys on our relationship.  Yes, please.  Please post it on this budding romance.  Thank you, guys.  And Nervous Oscar, show everyone what you can do on that fucking guitar.  Watch what you can do.  Play us out.  I like to go mellow.  You know, just...  Yeah?  No, no.  All right.  Whatever.  I don't know.  Sorry.  Wait, Sam.

[03:10:00]  Can't think of a song.  Come on.  Let me do this.  There's some extra writing.  No.  This fucking bitch wouldn't go out with me.  I have to go to my car.  Watch me and my friends went to the mall. 
[03:10:30]  Let me tell you what's going to happen to the luggage shop.  I drank beer one night.  I got pretty fucked up.  Went to my friend's house, drank more beer, and got even more fucked up.  It was hysterical.  Oh, wait.  What was I saying?  I forgot.  Oh, hi.  How are you doing?  Wait, wait.  Oh, then something happened Sunday.  Please get my car.  Awesome.  Thank you, guys.

[03:11:00]  Happy holidays.  Oh, wait a minute.  Best of Weird Medicine with Dr. Steve is this Saturday at midnight.  Dr. Steve interviews Ron Bennington.  That's a good one right there.
