<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the "After Opie and Anthony Live" segment, hosted by Sam Roberts.  The segment opened with a contentious phone call with Bobo, who angrily complained about his infrequent appearances on the main show, accusing Danny and Travis of hindering his on-air time and demanding at least two appearances per month.  The call was repeatedly interrupted by dropped connection.  The discussion concluded with a compromise where Bobo would appear less frequently.

The show then transitioned to a segment dedicated to "Joshy Tomatoes," a former intern known for his tomato-themed interviews.  Audio clips of a heavily edited interview with Joshy Tomatoes were played, during which the hosts and Jim Norton subjected him to a barrage of sexually suggestive and deeply personal questions about his virginity and masturbation habits, causing Joshy Tomatoes significant discomfort and leading him to withdraw from the interview.

Following this, the program shifted to a discussion of the repercussions from the previous day's interview with Paris Hilton.  Roland, a staff member, was interviewed about the extensive, both on and off-air, fallout from the interview. The hosts briefly mentioned the upcoming replay of Ron & Fez's interview with the recently deceased Jack Kevorkian.  They also teased Troy's successful strategy for avoiding jury duty, though the specifics remained undisclosed.

A later segment featured a caller recounting his experience with jury duty. The caller, a heavily tattooed man wearing a pink shirt and cut-off camo shorts, deliberately presented himself unconventionally. During jury selection for an attempted murder case, he openly admitted to the judge that he worked in radio and couldn't guarantee he wouldn't discuss the trial on the air. Despite the judge's warnings about contempt of court, the caller was dismissed from jury duty.  This led to a discussion about finding a temporary replacement for the "After Opie and Anthony Live" host, who was taking a day off.  A listener call-in segment allowed listeners to vote between Bobo, Club Soda Kenny, and Nicole.  After the call-in segment, the show's staff voted, ultimately selecting Club Soda Kenny as the temporary replacement host.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Is anybody really surprised?  It's after Opie and Anthony Live.  They said they were going to take a break.  They didn't say who would be here after the break.  Opie and Anthony are gone.  They did the old, I'm gonna take a break.  That way, management won't come up the hall for at least a few minutes. 
[00:00:30]  Giving me time to sneak out of here.  Rob Cross was just in the studio talking to me.  I don't think I was the guy he came in here to see.  But Opie and Anthony are long gone.  It's a Friday.  And I guess they decided to give a little more time to After Opie and Anthony Live.  It's not that they just wanted to go home, I'm sure.  They just felt like, you know, let's throw this guy a bone.  Thank God for all of us, though.  We ended the show with this man.  I think it's you.  I'm just going by your phone number.  Bobo. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, that's right.  It's me, Bobo.  That time they were calling.  My phone crapped out.  What happened?  No, the battery just ran dead.  That's all.  So how did you, what, did you just plug it back in?  Yeah, that's what I did.  Now, I wasn't fully understanding.  What happened yesterday was you called the office.  And Danny and Travis told you that you no longer own the copyright on the name Bobo.  Yeah, they did.  I don't know where to get that, got that. 
[00:01:30]  Well, Danny said he registered the name simply before you had a chance.  And with that, you lost the rights to it, correct?  Yeah, supposedly.  Now, you won it back today, correct?  Yes, that's right.  And how did you do that?  I answered a bunch of my problems.  How many did you get right?  How many did you get wrong?  I don't remember how many I did.  I just remember I answered a number of them.  Are you a little pissed off?  I'm getting a little bit of an angry vibe from you. 
[00:02:00]  Did you think that Opie and Anthony were going on a break and not realizing that you were going to be stuck on the shit show?  Because I know you don't like doing this show.  No, I don't think that's all right.  They're Opie and Anthony.  They wanted to rush home.  They could do that if they want.  Well, I mean, this show has become, I mean, it's called After Opie and Anthony Live,  but it's more commonly referred to it by its nickname, which is The Shit Show or The Shit Hour. 
[00:02:30]  I don't remember which one.  I think The Shit Show is a little catchier.  But that's the name you gave it because you were sick of being booked on it.  You didn't want to do it anymore.  Correct?  Yeah.  Now, and that's what I'm asking.  Are you now pissed off that you've ended up back on this show?  Yeah, I am.  I had a bad feeling about that.  Why don't you, what's wrong with this show?  What puts you so above it? 
[00:03:00]  No, it's just they feel that every time I've ended up on the show,  every time I've been booked by the O&A show.  But you were on the air last week for the Physical Fitness Challenge.  You were just on O&A today.  Yeah.  How often do you feel Daniel Bobo Curlin should be featured on the Opie and Anthony show?  I don't know.  I've had no problem with twice a month.  Twice a month is the compromise that you're willing to make.  Yeah.  I think that's fair. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, exactly.  And who is it that's stopping you from making your bi-monthly appearances?  I don't know.  I just think things never...  Look, Bobo, you could be...  Let's be honest here.  We transferred you to Nicole from the morning mashup, as we said on the air.  I was listening to part of that conversation.  So I know that you feel like there are certain people that are stopping you from getting on the Opie and Anthony show,  and it's not Opie and Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  Bobo, just level with me here.  Who do you think the problem is?  Don't be afraid.  You got Opie and Anthony in your corner.  You know, you've narrowed it down to say that you feel you're entitled to at least two appearances a month.  Who do you think is stopping you from being on the Opie and Anthony show?  I feel it's the staff.  Who on the staff?  Is it E-Rock?  E-Rock, are you doing this?  I never talk to him.  Okay, so is it E-Rock?  No, I think it's...  Maybe it's... 
[00:04:30]  I don't know.  Maybe it's half Danny and Travis.  I don't want to say anything bad about them, all right?  No, you're not saying anything bad.  You're not saying they're bad people.  You're just saying that Danny and Travis are the people keeping you off this radio show.  Yeah, it's like...  Wow.  All right, I don't mean to put them down, all right?  No, I know you're not trying to put them down.  Danny, did you hear what Bobo just said?  No, I was walking around.  I didn't...  He...  I was just talking to my pal Bobo on the phone here on After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:05:00]  Talking to him about...  Because he thinks the staff is keeping him off Opie and Anthony.  And I said, who specifically?  Is it E-Rock?  He said, no.  I said, well, Bobo, you've got to tell me who it is.  And he said, it's half Travis, and then half, or maybe a little more than half, is Danny.  Why would I keep you from the show, Bob?  I don't know.  I guess maybe...  I don't know.  I guess maybe sometimes you feel like saying yes, sometimes you don't. 
[00:05:30]  He feels like he's entitled.  He's compromised at this point.  And Bobo feels like he's entitled to two appearances per month.  Travis, did you hear this?  That Bobo feels that you and Danny are keeping him off the show.  And keeping him from his entitled, contractually obligated, two appearances per month.  Bobo, who always answers your phone calls?  You guys.  Case closed.  Who always tries to come up with stuff for you to do?  You guys.  So how are we keeping you off the show? 
[00:06:00]  Is it the amount, Bobo?  Like, maybe these guys come up with stuff for you, like, maybe once every couple months,  but they're stopping you from doing it, like, every two weeks, like you should be.  Talk into the phone, big buddy.  Bobo, you've got to talk into the phone.  Do we lose Bobo?  Yeah, he's gone.  Well, see you later.  Are you guys keeping him off the show intentionally?  I would never keep him.  Bobo's my favorite guest on this show.  Do you think maybe twice a month is a bit much?  It's a bit little. 
[00:06:30]  You think so?  Yes.  For you?  For me, yeah.  For me personally.  For some of the listeners, it's probably a bit much.  Travis, in all your dealings, has there ever been a guest on the Opie and Anthony show  that calls you and says, listen, I should be on the show twice a month.  It's Bob Kelly.  Just Bob Kelly.  And that's why he's been banned.  Yes.  And Bob Kelly calls the office and goes, oh, come on.  I own his name, too.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I figured he would have enough pride, but he doesn't.  I don't know why I thought, Bobo, you're back. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, just start that, but I just have to take care of a little something there.  What did you have to take care of?  No, it's fine.  All right.  My mom just asked me to hand her something.  So you had to hang up the phone?  So you had to hang up the phone.  All right.  I had to hang up already.  I rushed, all right?  Bobo, you're lying.  I'm not lying.  All right, Bobo, we got to end this.  Eric, do you think Bobo should have two appearances per month?  I don't think Bobo should have any appearances per month.  Okay, so that's one no.  Bobo, you hear that? 
[00:07:30]  So, Travis, do you think Bobo should have up to two appearances per month?  Absolutely.  Okay, so so far, Travis has said yes, and actually E-Rock has said no.  Maybe E-Rock is a guy who's working behind the scenes, keeping you off the air.  Is he calling from the moon?  I don't want to say anything bad about him, all right?  Why not?  I don't know.  I just feel he just gets upset.  It just...  Bobo, you're calling...  He's calling you soft, Eric.  Bobo's been trying to get a Worst of Special of his own. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  I heard that it was being done behind the scenes, and we were not to tell anyone about it.  You lied about that, Bobo.  Your phone's breaking up, and plus you're Bobo.  People are just completely done with you.  We should probably just ban him from the show.  I'm not going to ban you from the show because I'm not going to make you cry again.  However, how about from here on out, the Opie and Anthony show as a show will, when we want you,  we'll give you a call, or when, like, Travis, me, or Danny just wants to chat, we'll give you a call just to chat. 
[00:08:30]  But committing to two appearances per month, maybe we can't commit to that extent.  Is that okay?  Well, I don't know.  I can't wait longer than a month to get on a right.  I don't...  So intense.  To me, it's like putting my ears...  Holding my ears hostage when they got a...  You can listen, Bobo.  You're allowed to listen to the show all you want.  You just can't be on...  I mean, twice a month. 
[00:09:00]  The bosses here don't want you on twice a month, to be quite frank with you, Bobo.  I mean, it's like we're not thinking about just what amuses us, but we're thinking about doing a show.  Like, right now, I'm thinking to myself, okay, we did the Bobo thing.  After Opie and Anthony Live is a little more fast-moving.  We've got to move into a bit or some other topic.  We can't keep Bobo on the phone.  So, I mean, you know what I mean?  So, we...  I know.  I'm able to reach an agreement at least once a month.  Maybe.  I can't... 
[00:09:30]  Bobo, guests don't...  You're not...  Yeah, you really have no leverage here, Bobo.  It's not Opie and Anthony and Bobo.  Like, there's no agreement to be reached.  It's more like you're a guest.  So, it's like when we invite you, you can come on.  Not like, you know, what's in my...  We don't pay you any money.  Why do you feel that you're so entitled to a once-a-month appearance?  Well, I feel like...  I feel like that...  I feel that cool with you guys that I can get that at least.  No.  Okay.  Well, that was blunt. 
[00:10:00]  No, Bobo, what I'm trying to tell you is that we cannot give you a commitment like that  because we don't give people commitments.  We don't give any of the comedians.  We don't give famous people commitments like that.  So, I mean, how can we sit there and...  All right.  As long as I'm not kept waiting too many, too many.  Well, we can...  When you have something in mind that you want to bring to the show,  or when we have something in mind that we want you to bring to the show,  then you can come on the show.  But in terms of just...  He's already done that. 
[00:10:30]  He can't just come on.  Once or twice a month saying,  Hey, it's Bobo time.  Nope.  You know, nobody wants to hear it anymore.  I don't know what you guys are talking about.  But you know what I mean, Bobo?  Is that cool?  All right.  But I...  Me just busy.  The longer I haven't been...  Bobo, you were on a week ago.  Bobo, you don't have any ideas.  We gotta let...  We gotta...  We gotta say goodbye.  I'll wait till next month and hopefully I get a call.  Okay.  Hey, Daniel. 
[00:11:00]  August is...  Yeah, next.  Next.  Yeah, next month.  Daniel, you know I'm not really gonna give you the trademark for the Bobo name.  Oh, shit.  I don't want him to cry.  No, no, no.  I want to cry.  No, I'm kidding.  That was only for the...  I need it.  Yeah, but Daniel was only...  I hung up on him.  I need it.  I hung up on him.  Because I mean, I can't...  It's nothing against...  You got a show to do.  We have other things to talk about.  Yeah.  And you know, he's probably not gonna call back anyway, so...  I think he will.  I think he probably will.  But I mean,  I'm probably gonna just pick up, 
[00:11:30]  ask him not to call back again,  then hang up again.  Okay.  You guys can talk to him in the office,  and then, you know,  give updates throughout the show.  You got a lot of show to do.  What are you gonna do if Bobo doesn't call in again?  I mean,  I...  Literally, there's tons of stuff to do.  Like what?  Like Bobo's PSA,  Bobo's Dick Breaks.  No, we're not gonna...  We're not doing any more from Bobo.  Oh, Bobo Dick Breaks.  Yeah.  We might play Bobo Dick Breaks a little later,  because that's good.  I mean...  It's a number one hit tune.  I'm gonna play the Nicole Richie  talking about the Clayhead from Lionel Richie.  I'm gonna talk about...  We talked about interns yesterday. 
[00:12:00]  Okay, Bobo.  We talked about interns yesterday.  I'm gonna play intern Joshy Tomatoes.  Oh, you know what?  I wanted to just shit on you just to shit on it,  but fucking Joshy Tomatoes is fantastic.  And I'm also gonna get Troy to tell me  how he got out of jury duty.  Yeah, listen,  you need to explain the whole Joshy Tomatoes saga.  Well, should we right now?  Get that one ready, Eric.  Because the thing was,  we were...  Obi and Anthony were talking about interns yesterday.  That's what brought this.  That's what brought this to my mind.  They were saying, you know, 
[00:12:30]  that we didn't have interns because of whatever.  And, you know,  they were going there,  doing their thing  where they're unhappy  that they don't have interns.  So, what that brought about was  shows when they have interns  end up with great intern-centered bits.  Sure.  They were saying,  Howard's doing intern week all week.  That, as evidence of  interns make for great material sometimes.  This was one of those times.  It was...  Joshy Tomatoes was an intern  who...  Danny, you always liked that he wore shorts and black socks. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, and I would always ask him,  why,  and he just really never had an answer for me  and just kind of seemed annoyed.  Like, I wasn't trying to get on him,  but he just...  Yeah.  He didn't want to answer my question.  So, I just decided to ask him, like, every day.  Right.  It's like the...  Like the...  Anthony Weiner thing.  Like, he wasn't answering about Twitter,  so people just keep asking him.  Exactly.  If you're not going to answer.  That's kind of...  I feel like I have a job to do.  It's my duty as a broadcaster...  Right.  ...to get the truth.  So, he said he really wanted this.  He said he wanted to be on the radio. 
[00:13:30]  He wanted the gig with O&A.  He wanted everything.  And so, sometimes,  being that I was an intern,  I feel like the interns can go through some testing  to not only their skill level,  but what can they handle.  With Joshy Tomatoes,  it was around the time that I think it was Salmonella  or whatever was going on in the tomatoes.  The tomatoes weren't good.  I remember that.  I couldn't get a Supreme at Taco Bell.  Right.  I was very upset.  And so, I told this kid, Josh,  that what would make great radio 
[00:14:00]  is going around on the street  and only asking people questions about tomatoes.  Hence the nickname,  Joshy Tomatoes.  Now, before you go any further,  whatever bit that is going to get played,  should get played.  But then, because there is kind of like a follow-up to this.  Kind of.  I...  Not...  Yeah, I don't know.  Oh, no.  No, I don't think there is.  Okay.  Yeah.  Alright, forget it then.  Who knows the way these things go.  Iraq had the same follow-up idea.  And I told him that he was factually inaccurate. 
[00:14:30]  So his follow-up idea wouldn't work.  However, this is good enough without the follow-up.  No, I agree.  So we sent him out asking questions about tomatoes.  He brought me back the audio,  and I told him that it was good enough  that we needed to present this to Opie and Anthony.  At which point, I cut up his audio,  and I went over to Opie and Anthony and said,  look, if you're having a slow day,  for instance, a day like today,  you have this going for you. 
[00:15:00]  You have this intern who went out on the street  and just asked people questions about tomatoes.  They ended up playing it.  They ended up asking him, like,  why would you think this is a good idea?  At which point, I guess he didn't realize  that I was having a little fun with him,  and he developed a hatred for me,  which some interns have because they just don't get it,  and realized that this has all been a prank.  Now, what person with any sense  would actually think,  I'm working for the Opie and Anthony show,  I'm going out and asking people questions 
[00:15:30]  only about tomatoes,  and I'm coming back,  and in the end, the joke's not going to be on me?  I don't know who could think that.  Yeah, I mean, especially,  like, I've been through it.  I was an intern for a really long time.  Yeah.  And, like, that beginning feeling of, like,  I just want to help out,  and, like, you really think that, like,  whatever audio you're getting,  you know, they'll make something out of it, I guess.  Like, I don't even know if he was thinking  on that kind of a level.  Who knows?  But, yeah, I mean, look,  if I brought home that audio,  I wouldn't have handed it to them. 
[00:16:00]  He gave it to me,  and I told him it was show-worthy.  And he believed me.  And it was show-worthy.  I didn't tell him why.  And what happened was  they ended up shitting on him a lot.  Now, this bit that you're playing,  is the aftermath of the tomatoes.  This is after the tomatoes.  So they asked him  about why he was asking people about tomatoes.  They got over the whole tomato thing.  And then Jim decided  that he wanted to make him feel more comfortable.  Oh, okay.  So that's part of this bit?  Because that's where I was going to ask you.  Yeah, that's what we're playing. 
[00:16:30]  Okay, excellent.  Jim sort of delving into the personal life of Josh.  And this is one of those things  that, like, if you're an intern,  and you want...  For this show.  Now, and here's where it comes in,  because when you're interviewed  to be an intern for this radio program,  there are a lot of questions that you're asked.  And one of them is,  are you familiar with this show?  Right.  And it's okay if the answer is no,  but what is told to the potential,  you know, applicant, let's call him,  is that you really should familiarize yourself  with the tone of the show, 
[00:17:00]  because, you know,  we want everyone to be comfortable here.  Because there's plenty of stuff  that we can do behind the scenes for you.  If you are uncomfortable on the air,  there's plenty of stuff you can do behind the scenes,  never going near the air,  you won't be made to feel uncomfortable.  Sure, but you need to know the vibe of the show, too.  Right.  You need to understand it.  Josh wanted to be on the air,  and he said constantly  that he wanted to be on the air.  Yeah, Eric?  Just so you know,  we're playing about 12 minutes of this.  This went on for 50 minutes.  50?  5-0.  5-0.  Well, it was a long one, 
[00:17:30]  and it was the XM side,  not the K-Rock side,  so there was a little stretching going on,  but we've condensed it for you.  This is what happened when Joshy Tomatoes  wanted to go into the big boys' room  and sit at the table with Opie Anthony and Jim Norton.  This is a segment that we call  Getting to Know Joshy Tomatoes  on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  You have a girlfriend?  No.  What?  Why no girlfriend?  Can't find some hot young tomato? 
[00:18:00]  No, I guess not.  It's a lot of surveys.  They've said women actually prefer a good sense of humor.  It's true.  First, so.  I'm kind of screwed there, then.  Oh, no, he's funny.  That was very funny, see?  You're doubting yourself.  You're really doubting yourself.  Yeah, don't doubt yourself.  When was the last time you got some pussy?  Actually haven't yet.  Yeah.  How old are you?  21.  And you never fucked a girl?  No.  At least he's honest. 
[00:18:30]  You ever had your cock and ball service with a mouth?  No.  I'm not trying to ask you respectfully.  No.  Never got a blowjob?  Drill a hole in a tomato.  No.  You have a kisser girl?  Yeah.  Just kiss her?  Yeah.  Or tongue kiss her?  Tongue kiss.  Any reason you're a virgin?  Virgin.  I know.  That's just.  I don't know.  You're homosexual?  Because sometimes people have this moral thing.  Sometimes it's religious.  Sometimes it's just a personal choice.  Sometimes it's saving it for marriage. 
[00:19:00]  What is it with you?  Are you saving it?  No, I don't know.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Have you ever sucked a ghost breast?  No.  Never feel one?  No.  Wow.  You never felt a tit?  No.  I feel like tomatoes.  Right.  Sure.  Right.  Good ones do.  Bad ones feel like a tomato with like a fucking one of those little shake up glass clothes.  Danny's writing down that the black socks might not help. 
[00:19:30]  A marble-y tomato.  Because you wear black socks with shorts.  Those tomatoes have got an Aggie in it.  There might be nothing that annoys Danny more in the entire office than Josh's black socks.  You do notice they're laughing still, Sam.  I was going slowly.  Oh, no.  It's horrible.  Oh, the tomato has to go.  Oh, it's tough.  It's got to go. 
[00:20:00]  Olivia Newton tomato.  Oh, that's horrible.  Who's this kid?  What are you just barging in on the scene here?  It's Bob.  Hey, Bob.  Who are you, Prince Harry Cheeks?  He's just all flustered looking.  What the hell is Prince Harry Cheeks?  Hey, Bob, you all right?  I'm fine.  How are you? 
[00:20:30]  Who are you, Bob?  Yeah.  Let's get to know fucking tall, skinny, probably well-and-down Bob.  Where are you going?  Josh.  Josh.  You're here.  How red are his cheeks?  What would you say there is red ass?  Yeah.  Josh.  I think I know the answer to this one, Josh.  Yeah, I do, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  So, Bob, you're very rosy.  You're a rosy-cheeked boy.  Have you always been?  Always.  I was going to say a virgin's bloody sheets. 
[00:21:00]  So you've never felt the girls...  Do you want to?  Yeah, sure.  Do you whack your bag on it?  Do I what?  Masturbate.  I guess.  You do it?  Yes, you do it or you don't.  How often?  I don't know.  You want to, like, squeeze Queen Pie Jones' boobs?  They're pretty close.  They're pretty close to a chick.  Pretty close to a chick.  All right.  Hold on, then.  You masturbate how often?  I don't know.  Let's think about it.  You know.  How often?  Everyone knows. 
[00:21:30]  Pretty common thing.  I don't know.  18, 19 times a day.  Every day, would you say?  No, not every day.  A couple times a week?  I don't know.  Uh-oh.  How often?  I guess a week.  Do you dry jerk or do you use lube?  No, I don't.  You don't use lube now.  Just dry jerk.  You just dry jerk or do you spit in your hand?  No, I guess dry, I guess.  Visual stimulation or mental? 
[00:22:00]  I guess visual.  Visual?  What do you use?  Sure you do.  You know the radio.  You do know.  You can say it.  Yeah, you know.  He opened by.  I don't know.  Josh.  Like a penthouse?  I'm done.  What?  Oh.  Who's the man?  Oh, shit.  I'm done.  He's done?  Why?  You're tapping out?  Yeah, I think so.  What got you?  I'm done.  I'm done.  What?  You're what?  Oh, boy. 
[00:22:30]  Josh, what's the matter?  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  Come on now.  Come on now.  What got you, Josh?  What finally did it in?  I don't know.  Huh?  What?  No, what got you?  Yeah, what's the problem?  What's the matter?  I guess it's like personal or whatever.  Oh, the masturbation stuff?  I guess.  Do you play your balls?  Or do you just jerk?  Because I like it. 
[00:23:00]  I'm asking.  Like, I like to take my thumb, and I push it under my balls, and I just jerk like that.  I kind of prop my balls up.  What's your technique?  You ever tried that?  You're a ball fondler?  Yeah.  All right, so how do you do it?  Backwards jerk?  Thumb at the base or thumb at the tip?  Backwards jerk's kind of fun, but it's hard to really get to do that a lot.  Opposite hand?  Make you feel like someone else.  So do you watch movies or go on the computer? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Oh, computer, yeah.  I'm done, man.  I'm sorry.  You're done?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  What does done mean?  Religious?  Yeah, religious.  Hopefully it was internship.  No, hold on.  I don't want to see...  Oh, Danny.  Hey, Danny.  Fine, I'm done.  No, we don't want to see what we're throwing out.  Oh, now Josh is done.  What are you done for?  What are you...  What are you...  What are you done for?  We're teasing you about a bit and asking about masturbation.  This is very basic stuff.  This is not...  In-depth.  So what's...  I guess I just wasn't ready to... 
[00:24:00]  Oh.  Talk about jerking off?  I guess, yeah.  Well, let's talk about it.  I mean, do you feel guilty about it?  I don't know.  Jerking off...  You consider that, like, embarrassing?  I guess.  Yeah?  Why?  No.  Everyone does it.  We do it.  All of us do it.  Gotta jack that fucking...  What part?  Gotta jack that cock.  When hot cum hits you in the chest?  Oh, yeah.  That's an excellent point I'll be making.  Is it?  Do you come into anything or is it just on you? 
[00:24:30]  That's a good question, though.  I'm done.  I'm done.  You what?  You come in a sock?  You ever just look around and go,  I ain't got nothing around here.  I want to jerk off.  I don't want to get out of bed.  I'm just going to come in a sock.  Yeah.  Do you ever do that?  Do you know, I used to...  We've all done it.  That's why everyone's laughing.  I used to come on myself,  and this is true,  I'd wipe it off with my sheets,  and then I would just move my sheet over  and fall asleep,  and it was crusted,  and my grandmother one time  was helping me change my sheet,  and she said,  What is this?  And I'm like,  I spilled Pepsi. 
[00:25:00]  Pepsi?  How does Pepsi...  I don't know.  You're asking me like I thought it out  like an architect.  I don't know.  So where do you...  Where do you lay that batch down?  I'm done, man.  I'm sorry.  You're done.  I've never heard you're done.  I know.  I give up.  You guys got me.  We don't want to get you.  No, we don't want to get you.  We don't want to hurt you.  We're just talking to you.  We're just kind of getting to know you a little bit.  It's not a win-lose situation.  Yeah, yeah.  This isn't a competition or anything.  It's just... 
[00:25:30]  This is what we do on a daily basis.  We just talk to each other about,  you know, this bullshit.  Yeah.  That's all.  He's an innocent guy.  How old are you, Josh?  21.  You said that.  21.  Okay.  Okay.  Now, the tomato jokes are a little innocent.  That's why we tease them.  That's a little bit of...  It's kind of...  It comes from a nice place,  but they're innocent jokes.  They're not really...  You're not a barbarian, obviously.  And so what are you, shy?  Are you kind of introverted?  Oh, that's a good question. 
[00:26:00]  I guess, yeah.  Yeah.  You're brothers and sisters?  No.  You're an only child?  Only child.  Okay.  That's interesting.  Parents are still married, right?  Mm-hmm.  You live with them?  Healthy parents?  I mean, like, a good marriage?  Were you taught about sex?  That was healthy?  That was bad?  I'm done, man.  I'm done.  I'm sorry.  All right.  We'll reign it back a little bit.  Yeah.  And talk about just going out.  You got friends and shit? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  What's the matter, Josh?  Yo, look.  I'm a loser when it comes to girls,  and tomato shit wasn't funny.  There you go.  We didn't say that.  I'm saying that.  No, we're not.  No.  Oh, you got to build that confidence up.  Yeah, we're trying to, like,  knock you down a bit  to make ourselves feel better.  But besides that, we're also...  No.  See, this is all I want to know.  You go out with your friends.  Do they get girls?  Do they...  I guess, yeah. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, okay.  All right, well.  Do you feel like a real loser?  There's always a fat girl.  Yeah.  Is that what this is about?  You feel like we're validating the fact  that you're a loser and you're not funny?  Instead of just...  What you're doing is you're taking...  You're taking it very, very literally,  like, the bit, let's be honest.  Maybe they shouldn't.  But instead of taking that in stride,  like, we're just goofing.  Yeah, I got you.  But you're taking it very personally.  And you're allowing it to hurt you.  We smashed your tomato bit  and made tomato sauce.  You know.  Yeah. 
[00:27:30]  Right.  So you want to do radio, right?  I'd like to, yeah.  But that's...  All right.  Well, there's nothing wrong with that.  So you got to expose yourself a little bit.  Not be afraid of...  It's not going to hurt.  Right.  What's so bad about it?  Are you seem like a nice dude?  Would you allow us to bring a girl in here  and give you a lap dance?  No sex.  Sure, yeah.  Sure.  So then why don't you discuss this stuff?  I jerk off.  A lot.  Big cock?  Let's ask it. 
[00:28:00]  Good question.  Yeah, sir.  Small?  I guess, sir.  No, I see a little penis.  So what?  I forgot...  I, honest to God,  forgot that some people look at sex  as like a personal or weird thing  or we're shy about it.  Yeah.  I honestly do forget that.  You're going to be all right, Josh?  Yeah, I'll be fine.  You're not going to give up, are you?  No.  You're not going to leave...  Don't leave your internship.  Why would you do that? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, don't do that.  If Danny wants me to.  He's just teasing me, dude.  Oh, you're just kidding.  Josh, you got to get a thicker skin.  Josh is very...  That's...  You're right, Ope.  You got to get a thicker skin, man.  He's very thin.  I thought I did, I guess.  I thought I did.  Like, you should start by just talking about  your, like, masturbation habits.  Yeah, you got to...  Like, you keep saying I'm done, I'm out,  but we're asking you something  that we all admit to.  It's not like we're asking you  to do something  that's brutal.  You know?  I'm just wondering if you're... 
[00:29:00]  You know, you say you do it  a couple times a week.  Do your parents listen to the show?  Oh.  Is that what you're worried about?  I'm done, man.  I'm done.  Done.  What are you done with?  Yeah.  I'm not sure what you mean.  You're saying you're done,  but we're not...  I'm done talking about it, I guess.  About what?  About the tomato bit or sex?  I'm honest to God, I don't know.  I think about the masturbation thing.  Everything.  Everything.  But, Josh, we're trying to, like, 
[00:29:30]  break you out of your show.  Seriously.  You seem a little uptight.  Yeah.  That might be one of the issues  that happens with the girl thing.  Do your friends...  What are you laughing at?  Do your friends, like you said,  they get girls...  You ever, like...  Maybe you like one of the girls  that your friends is going out with  or something?  Well, basically,  when Anne's asking us...  That's happened.  Have you ever, like,  hid in the closet  while your friend is banging?  No, because sometimes it sucks.  You see your friends  all getting fucking laid,  and you just gotta sit there  and go home and jerk off. 
[00:30:00]  It's fucking degrading.  After ONA,  it's live.  You know, in hindsight,  I'm not sure that that will help  as much as it will hurt  the fight to get interns back  on the Opie and Anthony show,  but you know what?  It was funny for all of you,  and that's what's important to me.  This is after Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  Jim's right about being honest.  It's important to be honest  on the radio.  Troy, you just walked in.  What's your jerk-off routine like?  How often?  That type of thing.  Uh, it's like... 
[00:30:30]  I mean, you're banging broads  left and right,  so it's gonna be less for you  than the average guy.  I don't know about left and right.  At least left.  At least...  Occasionally.  Okay.  Occasionally.  Uh, you know,  once a day,  once every other day.  Sometimes skip two days.  So you're thinking, uh,  three to seven times a week.  That's a rough guesstimate, yes.  Okay.  And, uh,  are we sitting down  or lying down?  Or standing?  Sitting down.  Just regular.  RedTube.com.  That's your...  That's my shit.  Site of choice.  Yeah.  Eric, what about you with the, uh, 
[00:31:00]  I would assume you have  very, uh,  small libido.  Uh, so what about you  with the, uh,  Masturbation Habits?  We're talking.  They're decent.  Decent.  What's it?  We're looking at numbers  per week.  Or per month  if that's easier for you.  Uh, probably a little  less than Troy's.  So we're thinking...  About three to five.  ...three times a month.  A month?  Yeah.  No.  So how many times a month?  Four...  There's four weeks in a month.  So four times a month? 
[00:31:30]  Maybe...  Maybe three?  No, maybe 15.  I don't believe that for a second.  What about you, Troy?  Do I believe that?  Fifteen times a month for Eric?  You think he exerts  that type of physical activity?  No.  Is Roland in there?  Yeah.  Send Roland in here.  He just woke up.  Hold on.  No, wake up, Roland.  Come in here.  Go in there.  Yeah, okay.  I want Roland to come in here  for a second.  Because, Troy, you hang out  for a second.  Because you tweeted  about having jury duty  at the same time that Ron did,  but you said you got out of yours.  So I would like to talk to you 
[00:32:00]  about that in a second.  But Roland is sleepily  making his way in here.  He was taking a little nap-ski  in the other room.  A little power nap.  He's got a recharge  for the afternoon.  Yeah.  Well, it's important.  Roland's got a tough job,  especially this week.  We spent the first hour...  Yeah, Roland's had a rough one.  And this all started, too.  What's funny is,  yesterday,  you were all in a good mood  because you got Jim  by putting the empty cup  of coffee on his lap.  He thought it was real.  He jumped up.  Everybody was laughing.  Everybody was having a good time. 
[00:32:30]  Of course, we've all heard  about the Paris Hilton  debacle by now.  Oh, by the way,  when I'm talking about interviews,  because I'll forget this.  I don't mean to interrupt,  but Ron and Fez,  much better interviews  with their guests  than we did with Paris Hilton.  Always a good interview  on Ron and Fez.  And one of the best,  at least in recent memory,  was the Jack Kevorkian  interview.  Of course,  Jack Kevorkian just died today.  And so,  at 2 o'clock today,  Eastern Time,  right here on the virus,  Ron and Fez are going to be  replaying their  Jack Kevorkian interview, 
[00:33:00]  the one that Ron did.  And Ron will be talking  about his experience  and talking to him  and all that.  It was a great interview,  and especially getting a chance  to look back on it now,  given that we just found out  Jack Kevorkian died today.  It would definitely be  a must listen.  So that's at 2 p.m.  today,  Eastern Time,  right here on the virus,  Ron and Fez  and their Jack Kevorkian interview  and a little talk around that.  And we'll try to mention  that again here  on After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:33:30]  But Roland,  Yes.  Tell me this.  We started this show today  on O&A  with some Paris Hilton recap,  about an hour's worth.  Oh, yeah.  The show ended.  We had the Paris Hilton interview.  You had about 45 minutes  of ranting about it.  You had about a 20 minute  after O&A  all about Paris Hilton.  A lot of social networking  going on after the show.  On the Twitter,  Jim was Twittering a lot about it.  Opie Twittering about it.  Ant had one or two in there.  And then Opie  with the YouTube 
[00:34:00]  that was then taken down.  Who knows  what the deal with that is.  If you do,  feel free to embellish.  If you don't,  feel free not to.  But,  what I was going to ask you,  and then we start this morning  with a recap of yesterday.  Yeah.  This is an hour long.  Where are you at  with this right now?  How is your life  in terms of the Paris Hilton situation  is what we'll call it.  Do you know that girl  in Egypt who was raped?  Yeah.  She had it easier.  Oh, don't say that.  Don't say that.  I don't agree with that. 
[00:34:30]  Eric, do you?  He's not listening.  No.  Thank God.  He's listening to something else.  He would have been offended  by that statement.  I don't like that type of talk.  But what you're saying is  it's been  two days worth  of dick in the ass  for Roland?  I know how she feels.  Oh, Jesus.  Now,  is it  dealing with  stuff from her people?  Is it dealing with  stuff from  bosses here?  Is it dealing with  stuff from O&A?  Or did I just mention everything?  I say  all of the above.  All of the above. 
[00:35:00]  Were you kind of  did you realize  once it happened  that this was going to be  this long of a situation  or were you hoping  for a bit of a blowover?  Not a blowover  but not  as severe.  Um,  tell me this.  It seemed yesterday  like after the interview  everybody was still  on our side  except for the  out cue guys,  I guess.  No,  they're on our side.  I mean,  I talked to them.  They're really nice.  It's just like  anything.  They were upset  at the moment  and then it blows over.  Do they apologize?  Um,  they apologized to you 
[00:35:30]  but maybe not on the air.  Yeah,  but they just said  you know how it is  because they had a  They just got upset  in the moment.  Yeah,  in the moment.  Yeah,  and then  that's like what happened.  Jimmy got upset  and then he kind of  So,  tell me this.  Are we in trouble?  No.  With the company?  No.  Are we in trouble  with her people?  No.  So you think  Opie and Anthony  might be able  to skate this?  No,  we just,  yeah,  everything.  Because it wasn't,  I mean,  in the end  it wasn't anything  that we did on the show.  No,  no,  everything's taken care of.  Because of you? 
[00:36:00]  Or you,  or you're just  deeply involved?  See,  the problem is here,  folks,  as you can obviously tell,  Rowling can't give  too much information  because for every bit  of information  that he gives  on the air,  he's got about  six hours of work  that he has to do  to fix what he just  said on the air  because he's not really,  he's not even supposed  to be having this  conversation right now.  Probably not.  I mean,  it's not a good idea  for you to be  anywhere near a mic  given the Paris Hilton  thing,  correct?  I mean,  I'm not going to  divulge anything,  just that it's been 
[00:36:30]  a tough,  a tough go of it.  Today's Friday,  today's Friday,  that's why.  You're going to drink  a lot this weekend,  Rowling?  You bet your sweet ass.  I want to start  drinking like a new.  Well,  I saw Greg Charles  from Caroline's  walking around here.  Oh,  yeah,  we're in GC.  I know he's  your drinking buddy.  Tonight.  Blackow.  That's funny.  Total blackow.  You're counting on that.  Fuck my liver,  fuck the bladder,  I'm going for all blackow.  You mean your bladder.  My bladder.  Okay.  Now,  I had pains in my bladder.  I was thinking,  so you're planning 
[00:37:00]  a blackout.  Yeah,  I told my liver  and my bladder,  I said,  look guys,  we're going to  fucking rule tonight.  Pack it in,  you two,  because you're not needed.  Nope.  You're going to take  a lot of damage,  put on the artillery,  and we're going in.  Mm-hmm.  Then Saturday,  I sleep all day.  I wanted to play real quick,  this is a quick clip.  Masturbate to QVC.  You're going to  masturbate to QVC.  Yep.  What on QVC  will you masturbate to?  The lovely ladies  who says,  buy these pants.  You like the ladies  that sell things on QVC.  Do you not have pornography? 
[00:37:30]  That is pornography.  For you.  Oh, yeah.  So most people,  because most people  would make,  you know,  the little Roland  food channel  masturbation joke.  You correct them  and say,  QVC.  QVC is what I  masturbate to.  Yeah.  It's free,  24-7.  And you can masturbate  and you can buy things,  too.  What about,  what's his name?  Russell Simmons' brother.  What's his name?  From DMC?  DMC.  Run.  Run, run, run.  Reverend Run.  Reverend Run.  His wife sells things  on QVC.  Lil Jackoff? 
[00:38:00]  Probably got two squirts  from her.  A couple squirts.  At least a little bit  of pre, right?  Yeah.  That's disgusting, Roland.  We shouldn't be talking  about such things.  But you see that?  One was for Brooklyn.  One for Brooklyn.  One for Jam Master Jay.  Can't forget about him.  Pour it out for him.  That's disgusting.  But you see how easily  it comes off the tongue  for Roland?  Whereas Joshy Tomatoes,  not so easily.  You said I'm done.  What I wanted,  the reason I was asking  about Paris Hilton  is because real quick,  I wanted to play,  because it had me  thinking about it, 
[00:38:30]  when Ant asked  Paris Hilton  when things were  going poorly,  Troy, you remember this,  you were over  for a Paris Hilton picture.  I really was.  Because I'm a fan.  It didn't work.  Are you still a fan?  Yeah, of course.  You like her.  You like her vibe.  I thought it was great.  Everything yesterday  happened,  everything that happened  was fucking awesome.  How uncomfortable it was.  And the unfortunate thing  is being here in the studio,  you can watch what's happening  and watch where Jim  is looking  and watch their body language  that doesn't translate 
[00:39:00]  on the radio.  But you could just tell  that it was just,  it was so uncomfortable.  Well, we have a little taste.  For those of you  who didn't hear it again,  I'm sure,  spoiler alert,  I'm sure  that this will be  number one  on the countdown  this week.  But if you didn't hear it,  this is just a tiny little clip.  This is 30 seconds  of Ant.  Who did that?  Who passed gas just now?  I got scared.  I hope,  I hope that that  came through on the mic.  If it did,  record the show  and rewind it  because I'm sure  you heard a little bit 
[00:39:30]  because I have two  headphones on.  This was Ant  asking Paris.  Things got really,  started getting bad  and Ant thought  he would liven things  up a little bit,  at least put a smile  on Paris' face  by asking about  the Lionel Richie head  from the Hello music video.  Because of the  cool Richie  when she called in.  Right.  She thought it was hilarious.  So here,  we'll play this first.  This is just a quick clip  and again,  you'll be able to hear this  on the countdown  this weekend.  A quick clip  of Ant asking  Paris Hilton  from yesterday's show. 
[00:40:00]  Obviously,  you grew up  with Nicole Richie,  Lionel Richie's daughter.  What about  that big clay head  in Lionel Richie's  video Hello?  You ever see it?  No,  I haven't seen that.  I love that song though.  I'm obsessed  with the big clay head.  I have to check it out.  Yeah.  On YouTube.  I haven't seen it.  Because I thought  it was on display  somewhere in  Lionel Richie's house  and I would assume  you would have been there  at some point in your life  and seen the big clay head.  I haven't seen that one yet. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, well.  Jimmy?  I'll check it out next time.  I'm trying to think  of something from the show.  It was a rough one, folks.  You can't just sit there  and laugh.  Like, it's funny.  Troy, you were sitting  in here laughing  at the question  even though you already heard it.  It's a funny question  to ask Paris Hilton  because it's so random.  Paris can't go,  oh yeah,  that would be hilarious.  Oh, imagine if it was  in his house.  Yeah.  So anyway, yeah,  I don't know if you saw  my show, but,  and then bring it back  to the show  and all of a sudden  you're an engaging,  interesting person.  I'd like to watch 
[00:41:00]  this reality show.  Yeah.  But it didn't work out that way  obviously as you just heard.  We had Lionel Richie's daughter,  Paris Hilton's  former best friend,  on the show.  It was 2007 actually.  It was on the K-Rock years  and it was when we were on K-Rock.  It was not on the XM side.  It was just a phoner,  but it was still Nicole Richie  and she was very engaging.  Like, Roland,  you booked that, right?  Yeah.  They didn't want to take it.  No.  You had to fight for that one.  Yeah.  Yeah, we were guest heavy that day  because we had Brian Regan  and Chuck Liddell in studio 
[00:41:30]  while talking to her.  And they, yeah,  and they really didn't want  to take the phoner.  If she had been a bad phoner,  she would have been hung up on.  Yeah.  And that would have been  a dick in the ass for you,  correct?  Yeah, correct.  Yeah.  So, she wasn't though.  As it turns out,  she was actually a great  phone interview.  And to be a great phone interview  is a lot harder  than being a great  in-studio interview.  But she was actually  fun enough  that we kept her on  for 15 minutes.  Which is a lot  for this show, I think.  Especially on the K-Rock side.  Yeah, especially on the K-Rock side. 
[00:42:00]  So, this is just a quick clip  of Nicole Richie  being asked the same question  about her father,  Lionel Richie's  clay sculpture head  from the Hello! music video  right here on  After Opie and Anthony.  After Opie and Anthony.  Do you want to ask  any questions  or something?  Yeah, I have something  I have to ask you.  Of course,  Lionel Richie's daughter.  Love Lionel Richie.  Where is the big clay head  from the Hello! video? 
[00:42:30]  We have it, actually.  You have it?  We have it, yeah.  The big clay head.  The big clay head.  Do you think it looks  anything like your father?  No, and I actually  don't like looking at it.  And who made it?  Did that blind girl  actually make it?  Because I would only say  a blind girl could have  made that because  it looks nothing like him.  I don't think she made it  and she's actually not blind.  I actually recently,  well, not recently,  but about five years ago,  recognized her. 
[00:43:00]  I saw her in a commercial,  like a Burger King commercial  or something,  and I was like,  is that the same girl  that was in the video?  That's the one  that made your head  or supposedly made the head.  That's not a good compliment  for an artist to ask,  are you blind?  Where do you keep the head?  Where does your dad  keep the head?  He has like a collection  of stuff,  so I know I've seen it.  I don't know exactly  where in the house.  I would display it  right in the foyer.  Right in the foyer.  Right when you open  the huge doors.  Right when you walk in.  Yeah, I'm sure your father 
[00:43:30]  has this huge entryway,  and I would put it  in a big glass case  just sitting there  like the idol  in Indiana Jones.  that big clay head  with the giant,  giant jaw  and the hair  that looked nothing like his.  I think he should  actually put it  at the gate,  so before you...  Oh, that would be good.  You're warned,  like this is what  you're walking into,  you know?  Or actually have it  tip back and have  a red button  that he pushes  and a secret panel  opens up  like Batman's house.  Or on a post 
[00:44:00]  at the foot of the bed,  so it's just staring  at you all the time  while you're sleeping.  I would love to look  at a bust of my own head  on the foot of the bed.  Nicole, I've been fascinated  with the clay head  for years.  Loves it.  Yeah.  Does he dance  on the ceiling?  What?  Does he dance  on the ceiling?  Every night.  Every night.  Not entertaining  the whole pregnancy  thing, though, huh?  I'm sorry?  Damn, I wanted a scoop.  Yeah, we need a really...  We need a scoop.  Do you think page six  is going to write  about the clay head,  Nicole,  and the information... 
[00:44:30]  Clay head!  That's really interesting.  The big headline.  I think...  Listen, I give you guys  credit.  You guys are finally  talking about something  that no one else  talks about.  I know!  I personally get so sick  of people asking me  the same stupid questions  over and over again.  See, I knew it.  That's why I wanted  to talk about that.  I can see...  You guys have been  my favorite interview  so far.  It's going to say it  on page six.  It's going to say,  Nicole Richie confirms  clay head  at dad's house.  All right, Nicole.  Thanks for giving us  a call  and continued success. 
[00:45:00]  All right, you guys.  Thanks.  Tell your father  I love him  and love the head.  If you want,  I'll try and get  a clay head  made of yours.  Oh, my God!  I would love that.  Get me a picture  of the clay head.  I will.  The sad part is  she's not even  going to remember us  when she makes you  Oh, yes, she will.  She'll remember us  every time she sees  that big clay head.  All right, Nicole.  Thank you.  After ONA,  it's live.  So there you have it.  That's how you conduct  an interview.  Well, not conduct.  That's how you are  an interviewee.  Like, she was down  for the question.  She was making  a little joke  here and there.  And we learned 
[00:45:30]  something.  That the head is still  in Lionel Richie's house.  Who would have thought?  Like we said  a little earlier,  make sure you're  tuned in to the virus  later today  because Jack Kevorkian,  Dr. Death himself,  passed away.  All the news channels  are talking about it.  We got all the big screens  in here and they all  have Jack Kevorkian's  face on it.  He was in here  and I remember  the talent department  here at Sirius  was all in a tizzy  because nobody knew.  That was before  you were here, Roland.  Nobody knew that 
[00:46:00]  Dr. Kevorkian was  coming up here  because I think  Earl booked it  and he didn't tell  anyone in talent  and so they got  all freaked out.  They hated it  that Kevorkian was  up here in  Ron and Fez's studio  and did an interview  with Ron  because he didn't  do anything else.  But, you know,  all's well  that ends well,  I suppose.  But at 2 p.m.  today,  Ron and Fez  are going to be  replaying that  Dr. Kevorkian  interview  and, you know,  talking about their  experience with the guy.  It should make  for Great Radio. 
[00:46:30]  I know I'll be listening.  Ron  has been  in jury duty.  That's why he hasn't  been on After ONA  live recently.  Troy  got jury duty  one.  Yeah, because  Troy was in jury duty  beginning of this week.  That's why  some of you  lucky fans out there  who called the show  the first two days  of this week  got to hear this voice  a little more.  And they do.  They call up  and they go,  is that you, Sam?  And they go, yeah.  And they go,  and they hung up.  And they go,  oh, okay.  And then they just get  to what they were  going to say anyway.  It's nothing.  It doesn't mean anything. 
[00:47:00]  But I read,  I follow you,  Troy Kwan,  on Twitter.  And it said,  what was your tweet?  It said something about,  like,  just had the greatest  excuse ever to get  off jury duty.  Yeah.  But you didn't say  what it was, Troy.  Right.  And then you didn't  come on here and say  what it was.  I need to know.  Lefty hanging.  I mentioned it  on my Facebook page,  but.  I can't check every  Troy Kwan Avenue.  Well, basically,  nobody wants to do  jury duty.  Have you ever done it?  No, I haven't been close. 
[00:47:30]  It's the worst.  Do they pay you?  No, four bucks  or five bucks.  Four dollars?  I think they give you  $40 a day,  I think.  I'm not sure.  I mean,  they didn't really say  anything to me about it,  so maybe I'll get  a check in the mail.  That'd be nice,  $80.  Yeah.  You could use it.  Times are tough.  But they basically,  they call you  into this room  and then they say,  okay,  there's this going on  and then you have  to go into the courtroom  and then they have  to select a jury.  Now,  is this the first day  or the second day?  This is the first day.  Okay.  And they bring in 
[00:48:00]  100 people,  so then they narrow  that down to  13 people.  So do the other people  get to go home?  Well,  they call people up  and they say,  do you think  you can serve on this?  Is there anything  that would prevent you?  This was an attempted  murder that happened  on the subway.  So when they call you  in and they say,  okay,  you're not fit  to be on this jury,  do they send you out  and try to get you  on another jury  that day?  No,  that's it.  You're done.  Oh,  that's the way to go then.  Yeah.  So you have to sit there  for the rest of that day  and hang out  in this other room  until that day is done  and then the second day 
[00:48:30]  when they call me back,  then they were letting  people go.  Oh.  So they bring  these people  and they say,  you know,  How long is it?  All day.  Oh.  Yeah.  Just the selection.  And then they say,  you know,  this was an attempted murder.  You're going to be  looking at gruesome pictures.  Do you have a problem  with this?  You know,  these are the questions.  Have you ever been  involved with something  like this?  What were you wearing?  Because right now  you got a V-neck  T-shirt on,  which on most people  is Simon Cowell.  A little Simon Cowell action,  which on most people  would be fine,  but you're walking in,  you can see the flames 
[00:49:00]  that are tattooed  on your chest  coming through  your T-shirt.  There's an octopus  on one arm.  There's flaming skulls  and a little shop  of horrors monster  on the other arm.  There's a big orangutan  on one arm.  I mean,  and your hair  looks like a devil  worshipping Adam Lambert.  Yeah.  So, I mean,  you're a sight to be seen.  And this is how  I present myself for work.  Right.  So you can imagine  how I went into...  Took it up a notch.  Yeah.  I was in cut-off camo shorts  with all my tattoos  blazing on my legs. 
[00:49:30]  On your legs, too.  And I was wearing  a pink shirt.  And you did that  intentionally?  Yeah.  To look like a maniac?  Yeah, absolutely.  Okay.  So, they say to you,  is there any reason  that you would not  be able to serve  on this jury?  And I raise my hand,  they call me up,  and they say,  okay, what's your problem?  I say, well,  I work on the radio,  and I can't promise you  that I won't go on the air  and talk about the trial.  You told them that.  As it's going on.  Like you said,  straight-faced,  knowing the juries  are not supposed to...  You said,  I might go on the radio  and talk about all of this.  Yeah, I said,  I talk about anything 
[00:50:00]  about my life,  it's all an open book.  Right.  And they said,  because they said  that it's going to be  Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.  That's going to be  the trial days.  It's an open book for me.  Sorry, that's your guy's thing.  So, we would be off  Thursday and Friday.  They said,  well, you'll be here.  You won't be able  to be on the radio.  I said, well,  Thursdays and Fridays,  we're not in here,  so I will be on the air  talking about this  on those days.  And they said,  you will be in contempt of court  if you do this.  And I said,  that's why I'm giving you  some heads up.  You said,  you can't hold me 
[00:50:30]  in contempt of court.  I'm letting you know now.  Yeah, I'm telling you now  that I'm going to talk  about this on the air.  Yeah.  So then that was  the first day.  The second day,  I actually got called up,  so I had to sit there.  And they said,  Mr. Henson,  please come up here.  So I went up,  and they said,  you know,  you will be in contempt of court  if you do this.  Do we have your word  that you will not  talk about this trial  as it's going on?  Yeah.  And I said,  I will try my best.  You couldn't give them  the confirmation.  And I was afraid  that they were going  to arrest me.  I really was.  You were skirting that line. 
[00:51:00]  Because they kept saying,  we're going to ask you again.  Will you not do this?  And I said,  sure.  You wouldn't give them  like a yes or no?  And you were wearing  your pink t-shirt  and your camo?  Yeah.  I looked great.  I looked like a million bucks.  Then they call me up,  and then they make you read  a couple things like,  what do you do for a living?  One of the questions was,  have you ever been involved?  Have you ever been  the victim of a crime?  Mm-hmm.  And I said,  yes,  I've been the victim  of multiple crimes,  three of which  have been very violent. 
[00:51:30]  There's a family  with these right there.  And so,  oh my goodness,  Kelly Kapowski,  right outside.  Why didn't you do it  after Opie and Anthony Live?  She's in your one question.  She is?  Yeah.  Nice.  So,  and then they...  So that was it.  Yeah,  they let me go.  They were like,  we cannot handle this guy  on a jury.  Right.  Well,  it's brilliant,  and at least now  I know how to get out  of jury duty  should it come up.  Eric,  how much time do we have  left in this show?  You got about two minutes.  Okay.  People call up now.  866-WOW1-WOW,  866-969-1969. 
[00:52:00]  Everybody call right now.  I'm just going to pick up  blind calls.  I don't need a screener.  Here is the deal.  I'm not going to be here  on Monday.  I won't be in the studio.  What happened?  I'm not going to be here.  Why?  Where are you?  I'm taking a vacation day.  Where are you going?  I'm going job hunting.  I'm kidding,  of course.  Or am I?  Wink, wink.  Nudge, nudge.  No,  but I won't be here,  so call up.  The phones haven't been  switched over,  have they, Eric?  866-WOW1-WOW  is the phone number,  right?  Correct.  Okay.  866-WOW1-WOW  because we need another host  for After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:52:30]  Somebody has to host  in my place.  Could it be E-Rock?  I mean,  it could be Troy.  You're in here.  Travis and Danny  weren't in here.  I mean,  Roland,  you're a big favorite.  Maybe you should host  After Opie and Anthony Live.  I think Roland gets my vote.  Maybe Stanley T could host it.  Maybe Bobo could host it.  Let's start picking up  some numbers.  I'm going to start putting...  Line 1,  what's your name?  My name's Terry.  Terry,  who do you think  should host this show  when I'm gone on Monday? 
[00:53:00]  Bobo.  You think Bobo should host,  okay.  No.  No, you voted.  Sorry, Terry.  Line 2,  what's your name?  Mark.  Mark,  who do you think  should host?  Club Suda Kenny.  Wow,  that's a vote.  Yeah,  that's a good one.  Line 3.  I'm going to start putting it.  It's you.  Line 1,  what's your name?  Oh, boy,  he's listening.  He doesn't get a vote.  You're on the air now,  Line 4.  Hey.  Hey,  how's it going, Sam?  What's up, buddy?  What's your name?  Eric.  I'm in Orlando.  Who should host?  Well, 
[00:53:30]  I actually got out of jury duty  last year.  No,  I got to ask you.  We don't have time for that.  We don't have time for all that.  I just got to ask  who should host the show.  Oh,  you.  Okay,  thanks.  Line 7.  Who do you think  should host  after Open Anthony Live  in my absence?  Bobo.  Welcome to Votes for Bob.  Oh, God.  No.  Line 9.  Who do you think?  Roland.  Okay,  Roland.  That's another vote for you.  What's up?  Line 1 again.  Going back to the top.  Who do you think? 
[00:54:00]  Bobo?  Yeah,  who do you think  should host the show?  I'm going to say  Club Soda Kenny.  Line 2.  Yeah,  I think a pile of shit  should host the show  because there would be  no difference.  Is that Roland or?  That's Bobo.  Line 3.  It's definitely  got to be  Club Soda Kenny.  Wow.  Fuck that up.  Club Soda Kenny  and the Comedy Cop Cavalcade.  Okay.  Line 4.  We're just going to  take a couple more  because we're running  out of air time.  Line 5. 
[00:54:30]  Yo,  it's Ken from Jersey.  She hit that sexy ass  bitch Nicole in there,  baby.  You think Nicole  should do it?  That's a vote.  Line 6.  Nicole A.  Finney.  Who do you think?  What's up, buddy?  Bobo.  Another vote for Bobo.  Travis is cheering  for Bobo.  Line 7.  Breaking news.  Breaking news.  Yes.  It's finally going  into the Nothat.  Look,  line 7.  Who should vote?  Who should host  the show?  This is in the Nothat.  All right,  enough.  Are you going to vote? 
[00:55:00]  Are you going to vote?  He doesn't get a vote.  All right,  that's all the calls  I'm going to take.  Well,  we're tied  between Kenny  and Bobo.  Or both.  Well,  okay,  let's go around  the room then once  before we leave.  Eric,  vote.  Kenny.  Travis?  Bobo.  Troy?  Kenny.  Roland?  Kenny.  That's a lot of votes  for Kenny.  Kenny wins.  He wins 3-2.  Thank God.  No more Bobo.  Why don't you have  Kenny and Nicole?  Well,  because Nicole  only got the one vote.  If anything,  it'll be Kenny and you.  That'd be good.  And Bobo.  Kenny and Roland.  Bobo's gotten voted off  completely, right? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  So he doesn't have  a shot in hell?  Thank God.  Okay,  so Bobo will not be here  on Monday.  Come on.  Find out who is  when we return  bright and early  Monday morning.  Bobo,  if you call now,  you get to host.  No,  you don't.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Somebody will be back  on Monday  to host After Open Anthony Live.
