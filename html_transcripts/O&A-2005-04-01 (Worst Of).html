<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion of the Fox show "Who's Your Daddy?", a paternity program where an adopted woman seeks to identify her biological father from a lineup of eight men.  The hosts and a caller, Chris from Jersey, reacted to clips from the show with vulgar commentary and jokes.  This transitioned into a segment focusing on various on-air and off-air conflicts involving news anchors.  The hosts played audio clips documenting arguments between anchors and weathermen at different stations, including an altercation stemming from a mispronounced name, a pre-broadcast argument rife with accusations of drinking and unprofessional behavior, and a discussion of a Las Vegas weatherman fired for making a racial slur regarding Martin Luther King Jr.  They also discussed a lawsuit against Steve Bartlestein, a WABC-TV news anchor, involving allegations of sexual harassment, stalking, drug use, and the transmission of STDs, and heavily implied details surrounding Pat O'Brien's rehab stint.

The show then delved into leaked voicemail messages allegedly left by Pat O'Brien of *Inside Edition*, containing explicit sexual content and graphic descriptions of sexual acts with a woman he referred to as Betsy.  O'Brien also mentioned his wife, Linda, and his concerns about her jealousy.  The hosts speculated on the circumstances surrounding the leak and O'Brien's possible drug and alcohol use, discussing the legality of playing the tapes.  Shannon Mullen, author of *The Best You'll Ever Have*, joined the show to discuss sex and answer listener questions on sexual myths, the G-spot, sex toys, and various sexual practices.  Callers contributed questions about sexual encounters, fetishes (including scat), and sexual health concerns.

The broadcast took a sharp turn with the arrival of "Little Jimmy" Norton, a local comedian promoting his show.  This was followed by a voicemail from Jimmy's mother urging him to replace paying for sex with exercise.  The conversation continued with caller questions about “pussy farts” and a story about accidentally picking up a male prostitute.  Shannon Mullen's interview was repeatedly interrupted by technical issues.  The segment culminated with the chaotic arrival of Tippi Tom, a seemingly intoxicated and homeless man who disrupted the show with increasingly erratic and offensive behavior including threats of violence, discussions of sex acts with prostitutes, and complaints about his physical state.   The staff struggled to remove him from the studio multiple times.

The next segment detailed Tippi Tom’s extended, unhygienic bathroom break, during which he fell asleep while defecating, resulting in considerable discussion and the creation of video clips documenting the scene.  The hosts and crew commented extensively on the state of the bathroom and Tippi Tom's underwear, with a specific focus on the smell and visual details, including a potential corn cob stuck to his penis.  Steve, a staff member, was identified as having filmed the event. The discussion then shifted to whether someone could be paid to wear the soiled underwear. Three female guests, including a gymnast who performed contortionist acts, arrived late.  Despite their presence, the focus remained largely on Tippi Tom, who remained mostly undressed and engaged in inappropriate behavior. The hosts continued to make comments about his genitalia and hygiene, speculating about his sexuality and potential to masturbate for money.  The show concluded with Tippi Tom largely undressed and near the women.

Finally, the show featured a phone call with comedian Rich Voss, who discussed his experience performing after Bob Levy, known for his extremely vulgar and sexually explicit material. Voss's girlfriend, Bonnie, repeatedly called in, leading to playful banter and teasing from Opie and Anthony, who jokingly accused Voss of being "pussy-whipped."  The conversation included anecdotes about Voss's past appearances, including a dream involving a party with Black Sabbath and a subpar seat arrangement at a Donald Trump roast.  The hosts playfully suggested Voss and Bonnie have sex on air, a proposition he seemed hesitant to accept, although he jokingly offered to masturbate on-air instead. The segment ended mentioning upcoming calls from other guests, Shred and Reagan.

[00:04:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much. 
[00:05:30]  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  We were watching some clips of it and listening to some sound clips in the office earlier.  A lot of weeping.  You are in hell over here trying to find this.  You're like Bernie shuffling through his song list.  Because this is a different version of The Post. 
[00:06:00]  You sure it was The Post?  Ben raised a good point.  They own Fox.  It's the same company.  Why were they?  Oh, that's true.  There's always that bias that goes on with The Post.  Oh, my God.  It might be the Daily News.  It might be my second mistake.  Ben, don't you mean they own by the same company?  Let me see.  Was there a different version of The Post?  Just they're owned by the same company, Gabner.  Let me see.  That's old Rupert Murdoch over there.  Hey.  Maybe he read that in the Daily Mirror.  All right, my mistake.  British ass.  My mistake.  We've got to keep up with heaven and with the Queen. 
[00:06:30]  My mistake again.  Too much mistakes.  It was in the Daily News, wasn't it?  What are they unloading?  Oh, there's all kinds of stuff going on out there.  I doubt it's my computer or chair.  We know what it's not.  Let's narrow it down.  It's not anything we need.  No.  What is it?  They got the photocopier here, finally.  Is it hooked up and working?  Is it working?  They're setting it up over there.  It's like, what?  You're not in on that inside gag yet.  Chris from Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man. 
[00:07:00]  I saw who was your daddy last night.  Okay.  It sucked like every other fucking fuck, though.  It did suck.  That blonde was really hot, though, no?  Well, yeah.  She was kind of hot, but when she cried, she looked fucking disgusting.  She was kind of hot in a stripper way, which is kind of marginal at best.  Yeah, kind of.  But you could tell the guys that were there, a bunch of older guys, they were gawking at  her.  When her mother came on stage and you saw what she was going to look like when she gets  older, it was nothing to be happy of. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, but...  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  So, the adoption agencies out there are pissed off at this show.  Oh, yes.  And David Bianculli, Bianculli, some TV critic, is just up in arms because, I don't know.  I don't know.  Because it's bad.  It's exploitation.  Yeah, it's horrible.  It's indefensible television.  It should never have been made.  Does he complain about Maury Povich and Oprah and all those other shows that have been reuniting 
[00:08:00]  and capitalizing on that for decades?  Well, here's the deal.  Douchebag.  Who's your daddy?  In the mold of Joe Millionaire and my big, fat, obnoxious fiancée, a young woman named  TJ, adopted at six weeks when given up by her since-divorced parents, was asked to choose  from among eight men, one of whom was her biological father.  Yay.  The rest were imposters trying to trick her into selecting them instead.  Trick her.  If TJ guessed right through the various elimination rounds and identified her actual father, she  won $100,000, Anthony.  If not, the prize money went to the man who fooled her. 
[00:08:30]  What fun.  What merriment.  Merriment.  What's wrong?  That's what he writes sarcastically.  So, I thought it was a great concept.  It is merriment.  It is fun.  Why not?  It's TV.  They signed on for it.  How exploitive can it be?  She agreed to this premise.  No one's being tricked.  She agreed that, okay, yeah, I have a chance to win $100,000 by picking out my real father.  Sure, I'll do it.  One Fox affiliate didn't run it, didn't sign on to run it, and instead ran a documentary 
[00:09:00]  on adoption.  I'm sure they just really won in the ratings on that night.  Sanctimonious asses.  Not only do I agree with the show, but I think she should have been forced to sleep with every  one of the contestants.  Now, that would have been the better thing.  Absolutely.  Have her try to eliminate who her father isn't by sleeping with them, and then find out at  the end if she actually slept with her father.  Find out he was one of the...  It is a goddamn show.  He was the one that came back twice.  Nothing has changed. 
[00:09:30]  Stupid post.  She guesses it's her father recognizing the smell of whiskey on his breath.  Whites the whiskers against her cheek.  Quiet now, little girl.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  That's my special girl.  Let me show you how to make boys like you.  Oh, you creep.  You are a creep.  You do it too well, man.  We got clips from the show.  Fat black guy with glass dildos in that group.  Be my special girl. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  We get it, Jim.  Thank you.  Thanks for creeping us out more than brilliant.  Let's...  Yeah, here's a clip from Who's Your Daddy?  It was an incredible moment to see her for the first time.  It's been a long lifetime dream of mine, and I'm so proud of her.  To find my daughter was my main objective, and if she won some of this money, it was a bonus.  And it was really hard not to jump off those stairs and go down and run and hug her.  Yeah.  She's my daughter.  Yeah, so she comes out, and the eight guys are, like, standing there. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  And this guy is like, Jesus, that's my daughter.  And what a piece of ass, and I don't want these guys, you know, getting all creepy with  her.  Gawking at her.  Can I ask why James Gumm was looking for his daughter?  Oh, my God.  That did sound like it.  Wait a minute.  Is she a great big fat daughter?  She was a large baby.  Then this is classic.  So she's standing there.  I got her card in here somewhere.  She's standing there.  TJ, the hot blonde with the big boobies there.  Yeah.  And all these guys, there's eight of them, all say how, you know, they're her father. 
[00:11:00]  Her daddy.  Right.  One at a time.  Listen to this.  So, gentlemen, would you please introduce yourself?  Hi, TJ.  My name is Carl.  I'm from Simi Valley, California.  And I'm your dad.  I'm your daddy.  Good evening, TJ.  My name is Scott.  I live in Olympia, Washington.  Scott Peterson.  You know it wasn't him.  No, I'm your dad.  Hi, TJ.  My name is Charlie.  I live in Yuma, Arizona, and I'm your dad.  Hi, TJ.  My name is Peter.  I'm from Mesa, Arizona, and I'm your dad. 
[00:11:30]  Hi, TJ.  My name is Ray.  I'm from Redondo Beach, California, and I'm your dad.  Hello, TJ.  My name is Rick.  I'm from San Clemente, California, and I'm your dad.  And I'm a peeler.  Hi, TJ.  I'm Jerry.  I live in Norco, California, and I'm your dad.  Hi, TJ.  My name is Sam.  I'm from Little Rock, Arkansas, and I'm your dad.  Hi.  And I'm not your dad.  Wow.  One guy sounded like he was getting choked up there. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Could have been the...  The actor in the group.  You think?  Yeah, if he cared so much, he wouldn't have taken off on her.  Yeah, if Fox is going to show one guy crying out of all of them, obviously, that's the guy  that's not going to be it.  Don't fall for that silly TV trick.  Don't fall for that gag.  One of those guys is my dad.  There was this one guy that seemed to have...  Sounds all sexy.  One of those guys is my dad, and I'm going to give him a BJ he'll never...  He's not really my dad.  Just biologically. 
[00:12:30]  And he looks like the gopher in Caddyshack.  He's a fine radio show producer.  And he herky jerks.  That's a true emotion.  Scott.  Then I looked around, and then my attention was drawn to Charlie.  And then Sam caught my attention, because he kept looking down.  And it was like, he was trying so hard not to show emotion.  Trying hard not to look at your boobs.  Right, that's a dead giveaway.  Be excited.  Yeah. 
[00:13:00]  The more I hear her talk, the more I understand why he left.  You melodramatic L.A. whore actress.  Phony.  One of these guys is my dad.  But I thought it might be him, too.  Ugh, you auditioning piglet.  It's kind of creepy, because you know, there was probably some kind of sexual attraction  to some of these guys on her part.  Right?  You're just human.  You're standing there, right?  And then, you know, one of them is the dad, but odds are the one she might be attracted to  might not be. 
[00:13:30]  I am so looking forward to seeing if I could actually know my dad out of eight men.  I am so excited.  Ugh.  Isn't she just atrocious?  Maybe it's the guy who says under his breath, but audible enough to hear,  I should have kicked your mom in the stomach when I had the chance.  Maybe that's a clue.  Ugh, what an annoying whore. 
[00:14:00]  He should have dented that mother's stomach like Foreman did the heavy bag in When We Were Kings.  All right, so, we've set up a cocktail party here so you can talk to the guys.  We've told all the men everything that you know about your birth father.  I'm sure you've got a lot of questions that you want to ask.  You want to ask it immediately.  Most definitely, yeah.  Vanola set up a cocktail party for me, and I am going to be able to talk to each of these 
[00:14:30]  men and find out more about the person I have.  Ginger on Gilligan's Island sounds like all better actresses.  You ready?  Yeah.  Okay.  This is Sam and Peter.  Hi.  So have fun.  Okay.  She's leaving me.  Daddy diva.  Daddy diva.  That's a stupid voice.  You want to listen to some of the audio from the cocktail party?  All this is a fist hitting her in the throat.  I'd love to hear that.  She is just auditioning. 
[00:15:00]  You're right.  Ooh, and stop trying to be moving.  So exciting.  Yeah, you're an adult woman.  It doesn't matter anymore.  Yeah, you're not moving anymore.  We don't care that you're abandoned.  You're a coke whore.  Awful.  You're going to meet your new daddy.  You're going to go out to dinner a couple times.  That's it.  Who cares?  Yeah, and you wind up sleeping with a couple of his friends because they're probably producers.  Oh, okay.  Um, I want to ask so many things.  What two things would your friends say to describe you? 
[00:15:30]  To a fault, honest, and willing to help.  Okay, and you?  Honest, willing to help, and abandoning.  Hung and incestuous.  Rick?  Yes.  And your Charlie?  Yes.  What would you guys say your biggest passion is?  I love kids.  Find the good in everybody.  Bright poetry.  M&M's.  I wish I had to stop that because I was getting too fat.  Carl said something.  M&M's.  He said right on with what I like.  My number one candy when I was a little girl was M&M's. 
[00:16:00]  M&M's.  And you put him on his yam bag.  Give me a Roman war helmet.  Bicycle riding.  I like to go slower because you can absorb a lot more.  I got no feelings.  I just love the water.  And I hope I wasn't rude.  But I just didn't want to miss any opportunity to lay my eyes on my dad.  How would your friends describe you?  She should have a throat cut like a lamb.  Rick?  I kind of had like sharp features, like triangular. 
[00:16:30]  But I have round features.  Trustworthy.  Sincere.  And a lot of fun.  And Charlie had a little bit of round features, but not like mine, in my opinion.  What do you dislike most in other people?  Cheaters.  A child throwing.  Telemarketers at dinner time.  Ray.  The first thing I thought, he's too tall.  He's too big boned.  Then I kept looking at him. 
[00:17:00]  When he smiles, he has kind of the same smile as me.  So I was like, oh, so confused on him.  My friends would probably describe me as gregarious, giving.  And I would hope they would say I'm generous.  I got such a warm, amazing feeling from Scott that I actually had to look away.  Then he ain't your father.  He's either in the academy or wouldn't be after.  Really?  Figure it out.  The guy that abandoned you.  You're not going to have a warm, honest, sincere.  Generous.  Generous with seeds, chintzy on the child support. 
[00:17:30]  But it was not my dad.  And what if it's this guy over here, and I'm totally not paying any attention to him,  and then his feelings are hurt because I thought it was this guy.  Anyway, he's in there somewhere.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How funny would it be if the big goop at the end was that none of these guys were our  father.  He was actually killed in a drunk driving accident when you were six.  See, if I was a producer of a TV show, that's how it would end.  None of these.  There's a surprise twist.  None of them are your father.  Oh, wait, are they going to bring him out? 
[00:18:00]  No, no, no.  Tying his shoes and backed over in the driveway.  Here's a picture of his tombstone.  You can visit it.  No mention of you as a child on it.  You ate his ashes in the pudding, but you had an episode three.  Stupid.  So you can be together forever.  Melodramatic.  Dullard.  Oh, that would be the best ending ever.  Good show ever.  To get to know TJ with other men around, there was a jealousy. 
[00:18:30]  There was a fear.  Would you?  These guys are trying to be a father to my daughter.  It's very hard.  I love this guy.  That's the father.  He's like all pissed off because they're trying to be a father to my daughter.  Oh, man.  Yeah, what they did was they, throughout the show, they would black out one of the guys  and, you know, he'd talk with that voice and that was the real father.  Right.  So you couldn't identify him, but you would get his input. 
[00:19:00]  It's getting frustrated that the other guys were trying to be the father.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Could you help me with this couch?  Here she is crying.  Here she's crying.  My mother will pay you.  And it's weird because it's hard to forget his look after he danced.  He looked at me like, I'll do whatever it takes for you. 
[00:19:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Yeah!  I wonder what look that was.  Was it the look of a man hailing a cab and amscraining?  Amscraining?  We're running out of time on the show and we got to get to the big reveal.  Oh, damn.  Oh, damn.  But first, here's the father again. 
[00:20:00]  When I was up there and I looked across and I pictured her all the way at her first time  she ever danced.  And here she is teaching  a beautiful woman.  Hello, exactly!  Alright, well.  And here's the big reveal, I guess.  Ready for this?  What?  So anxious.  Here's the big reveal.  She gets to find out which one of these guys 
[00:20:30]  is her father.  Dad, I feel that I first  knew it was you during the cocktail party.  And I remember  when I walked out,  you think I missed  the way you stood there with pride?  And I figured  that's what you invite your daughter to be like.  When we sat down  and I was asking you questions,  you said,  be strong. 
[00:21:00]  And I thank you for that.  I believe  That's terrific.  That my father  is  Charlie.  This is a giant cock.  Adam, this is like her.  Was it Charlie?  It was!  It was Charlie!  It was Charlie! 
[00:21:30]  You look like assholes right now, man!  It was Charlie the whole time!  Sweetheart,  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Baby, Daddy's here!  Baby, Daddy's here!  Daddy's here!  You've got some funky-tasting spots.  I'm sorry, Mom.  We're gonna go to Disney World!  Don't be sorry!  I need to ask you one day.  Please forgive me  for the pain 
[00:22:00]  that I've caused you.  No!  No!  No!  You're forgiven!  What kind of is that forgiven?  Look at you!  Of course,  I forgive you.  And that was the greatest words  in my entire life.  Do you know what a boob is?  It was to be forgiven  by my daughter.  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Why don't you stop playing  with yourself, Billy?  Oh, my God!  I found it. 
[00:22:30]  I was so thankful  that that magical bond  that I was praying for.  It did good.  Who is your daddy?  Who is your daddy?  Stop whining!  I'm so proud of my dad.  You belong to me!  It's going to be all right.  You're a strong young lady.  You're a beautiful kid.  It's time now  to turn this mush  into muscles.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:23:00]  Here's Opie and Anthony  when they aren't stinking.  Ooh, who took their shoes off?  It's a little stinky in here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  So, uh,  we got two clips  of, uh,  anchors fighting.  The first one  happened this morning.  It's kind of subtle.  We're in the,  we're in our office  kind of, you know,  getting the show together  and we're watching  ABC News here in New York  and, uh,  hey Ben,  who are the anchors?  It's, uh,  do you remember?  It's the weather guy  and the,  Steve Berlstein  or Bernstein  or somebody like that?  Yeah,  who had some crazy stuff 
[00:23:30]  happen to him off air.  Like,  supposedly he's  a homosexual man  and he was stalking,  wow,  he was stalking  somebody else  with a laser pointer  and all sorts of crap.  Which one?  The weather guy  or the other guy?  The other guy.  The newsreader.  Oh, the, uh,  it's just newsreaders.  The mulatto guy?  Mulatto?  He looks black and white.  The mulatto?  What are you talking about?  He looks black and white.  The guy looks half black,  half white.  Mulatto's not,  it's not bad,  it's insulting.  I think he's an African-American.  Oh, is he?  He's very light?  Yes.  Are you guys insane?  You don't think so?  Did I miss something?  Yeah, I think he's...  You don't think that anchor 
[00:24:00]  is a black guy?  The one that was on the left?  Yeah.  Bertlestein or whatever?  Oh, he's not black.  I thought he was half black,  half black.  Wow, that's weird  because I thought...  Both of you guys thought that?  Yeah.  Wow, I didn't see that at all.  He looks...  Oh, there's our friend from Fox.  There's our buddy.  No, he looks light-skinned.  He does.  Dude, you don't see him  as a black guy?  Honestly, no.  I see him as,  I think, a Jewish guy.  Yeah, he's Jewish.  Is he?  I would assume he is.  What was the last name?  But what was the story with him?  He had a crazy stalking charge, man.  Yeah, into crystal meth 
[00:24:30]  and he was stalking like one of the...  Are you kidding?  It was while we were off the air.  How is he still a news guy?  I don't know.  Did we find that story?  It was great.  It was in the Post.  It's an unbelievable story.  Oh, then it's got to be true.  So anyway,  they're finding the story,  but so it's Steve  and then the weather guy  and they're doing a story  about Donald Trump's...  Trump.  Future bride's...  The Trumpster.  Future bride's dress, I guess.  Yeah.  And Steve was supposed to read it  because he's the news reader.  Yep.  That's all these guys are. 
[00:25:00]  They take their job so seriously.  All they do is read teleprop.  That's it.  Even Dan Rather  and, you know,  well, Tom Brokaw is now retired.  That's all those guys do.  But they're looked at  like these informative newsmen.  They don't do anything but read.  You're a reader.  Peter Jennings, you know,  they're all just reading the news.  That's it.  Yeah, other people write it  and they read it.  As much as I don't like them,  I have more respect for people  like, you know, Bill O'Reilly.  He's giving his opinion  and he's, you know,  discussing things. 
[00:25:30]  You know,  but these other guys,  they just read the news.  That's it.  That's it.  Actually, I like Keith Overman the best.  He's just...  He's just a...  Teddy Overman?  What?  I think you said Teddy Overman.  I said Keith.  Oh, all right.  Teddy Overman.  Dude, I'll mess up enough on my own.  No, no, I think you're messing up.  I just thought you were talking  about Teddy Overman.  I was going to go bowling with him.  See, I don't know this...  This reference, I don't know.  Damn it.  I hate when I don't get him.  Don't even tell me.  You've got to go through your box set  a little longer.  Oh, the honeymooners?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm bowling with Teddy Overman. 
[00:26:00]  Teddy Overman.  What a louse that Teddy Overman is.  I'm only up to the fourth episode.  Oh.  Yeah.  I got through the maid.  Yeah.  And what was the one after that?  I don't remember the order.  All right.  Anyway, so they're doing a story  on Donald Trump's future bride's dress  and Steve's supposed to read the story.  I guess he messed up the name or something.  He gets the name wrong.  I'm not sure if he got the name  of the bride wrong of Donald's girlfriend  or the name of the dressmaker or something, 
[00:26:30]  but he screwed up the name.  Right.  And the weather guy decides it's a good time  to point out that he screwed up the name.  And what does he think?  He's on this show where we do that  on a daily basis and just relish  in someone's mistake?  Yeah, we don't even try to do the radio show anymore.  We just stare at each other just waiting.  Waiting for someone to mess up.  Come on.  Screw a line up.  Come on.  Norton was first today.  Thank God.  But we all know it happens to us every day  and it's funny and we goof on it  and you laugh because you feel like an idiot.  Or sometimes it screws up a really funny line. 
[00:27:00]  Right.  Because you're so eager to get it out  of your stupid mouth.  Oh.  That's like my major problem.  I do it all the time.  We're talking.  I got a line in my head.  I'm waiting for the gap  so I can throw it in there.  I'm all happy, proud, confident of it.  You throw it out  and just an abortion flies out  from between your gums  and everyone just laughs at you  and you turn all red.  You get hot, sweaty.  It's great.  But on the news, 
[00:27:30]  they seem to take it very personally.  Yeah, so he messed up something.  We'll hear it.  I think we got the whole thing here  and then the weather guy jumps in.  He thinks it's funny.  Weather guy thinks it's funny.  Anchor guy pissed off.  It was pointed out in the first place  and not letting it go.  Right.  And so they kind of go at it a little bit.  I mean, it looks like they want to fight.  Yeah.  And then the weather guy  is trying to use like a little  sense of humor,  kind of laugh,  like he goofed on it kind of thing.  Like, hey, let it go.  And the anchor guy is just plain pissed  and the girl in the middle 
[00:28:00]  is just trying to diffuse the situation.  And this show,  we watch it a lot in the morning.  We start at Channel 7  and then we, you know,  we switch around.  It's kind of a...  They're not too serious to begin with.  They're kind of just hanging out,  giving you the news,  laughing a little bit, you know?  But not as wacky as like Fox and Friends.  Right.  No, no.  Yeah.  So here's the audio.  Oh, the weatherman's Bill Evans.  Thank you.  So here's the exchange  that happened this morning  about an hour ago.  Have you seen this?  This is a big dress. 
[00:28:30]  Something old, something new,  and something that costs about 100 grand.  Here's a look at the wedding dress  made for a supermodel,  Melania Nouse,  the former or the future.  What is it?  Wait, wait.  Go over that name again, Steve.  All right.  Yeah, that's it.  He just butchered her name.  Melania Nouse.  I thought it was a Melania Nouse,  which might be...  Is that the way it says?  I don't know.  It sounded like Melania Nouse.  I thought he said Melania Nouse.  I couldn't even tell you her name.  It's one of those names.  He did kind of mumble it.  Yeah.  He panicked.  You can tell.  You can tell there's a little gap  between when he says... 
[00:29:00]  You know, we've all been  in that situation as broadcasters.  Yeah.  You just hope to get through it.  Yeah.  Like, I'll get it close enough  where I'm...  You know, and I'll get past it  and then no one will point it out.  Not with Jimmy here.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  You've wrecked my whole thing.  That's the beauty of what we do  where we just goof on each other.  It's like, why can't a broadcaster  like that just go...  Wait a minute.  How do you say that?  Why can't there's any honesty  out of these people?  Well, they start...  They say, okay, go do the weaver.  You know?  Just goof on it.  I guess he wants to be known  as a serious newsreader 
[00:29:30]  and, you know,  these guys are pointing out  that he doesn't know  that he butchered the name.  Right.  Have you seen this?  This is a big dress.  Something old, something new,  and something that costs  about a hundred grand.  Here's a look at the wedding dress  made for a supermodel.  Melanica Nels,  the former or the future.  Why do I go over that name again, Steve?  What was that?  You know what?  Why don't you do it, Bill?  No, I'm not the anchor.  Melania, right?  Why don't you go over?  What'd you do it?  I'm not the anchor.  Well, you know what, then?  Then I piped out over there 
[00:30:00]  during the VL, wouldn't you?  Well, then what then, Steve?  Go ahead, do it, Bill.  It has 300 feet of satin.  If you're not the anchor,  then don't interrupt me.  I just...  I wanted to know what you said.  If you're not the anchor,  then don't...  Go, baby, go.  Go.  The guy was designed  by John Galliano  for Christian New York  and the bride plans  another dress of hero wing design  after the couple's first dance  wedding is set for Saturday.  Why don't you give it a shot there, Bill?  Hey.  I'm just representing the audience.  I'm just representing...  I heard loom in the mouth.  And I'm just saying... 
[00:30:30]  My bad.  My bad.  I'm sorry, Bill.  I'm not looking for an apology, sir.  I'm just saying,  would you like to take another shot?  No, I wouldn't.  I don't know.  I can't take a shot at it.  That's why I do the weather.  I don't read this stuff.  It is so cold outside.  It is so cold outside.  It's cold outside.  It's cold in here, too.  Oh.  Take a shot at the weather, if you want.  I don't know.  I'm not mad at it, man.  I'm good with that.  Hey, dude.  Okay.  I get paid either way.  Oh, you know you.  It's so cold in the weather to start today.  And it will be a day where it will be a cold day. 
[00:31:00]  Wow.  That's even better than how we heard in the office because we were half listening.  That is an angry.  You know what really angered him?  Wow.  That's great.  You could tell what really angered him as he was then finishing his read.  The weather guy is cackling like Ben in the background.  Did you hear that?  I didn't catch that.  He screws up.  They have their first exchange.  Then the anchor decides he's going to finish the rest of the voiceover, the rest of the read. 
[00:31:30]  And as he's doing that, you just hear, you hear this Ben-like cackle and it just really  pisses him off.  Was that the weather guy laughing or the Robin Quivers girl?  The weather guy.  Oh, okay.  It's the weather guy laughing at the anchor.  The weather guy at least was cool.  What a douche the anchor is.  Well, because he wants to be known as a serious news reader.  Douche.  Why don't you read it?  Why don't you read it?  Instead of just going, yeah, I screwed that up.  Because the weather guy, even after the weather guy realized that he offended him a little  bit, he was trying to keep it lighthearted.  Yeah.  Like any guy would do, but this faggot's all self-important. 
[00:32:00]  He should have said, what do I care what her name is anyway?  Yeah.  You zilch of questionable ethnicity.  And then they broke down the third wall, too, because he's like, well, why don't you  just be quiet then during the VO?  Yeah.  The voiceover.  Did he say the VO?  I didn't hear that.  Yeah, he said the VO.  Oh, I thought he meant vodka.  Which proves that he was, proves this was a little fun-loving exchange.  This was like, let's just shut the F up.  Can we play it again?  He says things a couple of times, which shows that it's not a joke.  He seriously means it.  Well, did you catch it when he goes, well, I'm the anchor, don't interrupt me? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  And the other guy goes, well, I didn't mean to interrupt you, faggot.  Sorry, I don't have a laser pointer that you can stalk me with.  You didn't catch that?  Wow.  We're trying to find the story, because the story is unbelievable.  That really is awkward.  It's Steve Bartlestein, it's Bill Evans, the weatherman, who points out him messing up.  Yeah, let's hear it again.  And then the female in the middle is Sandra Bookman, who's kind of loosey-goosey all morning  on this newscast.  Oh, I know who she is.  Her father used to be a janitor on Good Times. 
[00:33:00]  Of course he was.  Bookman, yeah.  I know that.  That one I know.  Sandra Booger is the name I call her.  Want to listen to it again?  And then we've got another audio that probably trumps this one.  Oh, yeah.  So, listen again here.  Have you seen this?  This is a big dress.  Something old, something new, and something that costs about a hundred grand.  Here's a look at the wedding dress made for a supermodel, Melania Nels, the former or  the future, Mr. Z.  Why do I go over that name again, Steve?  What was that?  You know what?  Why don't you do it, Bill? 
[00:33:30]  No, I'm not the anchor, Steve.  Melania, right?  Why don't you go over it?  What'd you do it?  I'm not the anchor.  Well, you know what, then?  Then I piped out over there during the video, wouldn't you?  Well, then what, then, Steve?  Go ahead and do it, Bill.  It has 300 feet of satin.  If you're not the anchor, then don't interrupt me.  I just, I wanted to know what he said.  No, if you're not the anchor, then don't.  Go, baby, go.  Go.  The guy was designed by John Galliano for Christian New York.  Wow, does she call him a baby?  No, she said, go, baby, go.  Like, go.  And then here's where he's cackling.  He's just cackling like Ben. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Laughing at Steve.  Cackling, his hair's all messy.  He's doing coke off the weather map.  I just, I wanted to know what he said.  If you're not the anchor, then don't.  Go, baby, go.  Go.  The guy was designed by John Galliano for Christian New York.  And the bride plans another dress of your wing design after the couple's first dance.  Wedding is set for Saturday.  Why don't you give it a shot there, Bill?  I'm just representing the audience.  I'm just representing the audience.  I heard loom in the mouth.  And I'm just saying.  My bad.  My bad.  I'm sorry, Bill. 
[00:34:30]  I heard loom in the mouth.  I'm not looking for an apologist.  I'm not talking about a shot.  I'm just saying, would you like to take another shot?  No, I wouldn't.  I don't know.  I can't take a shot at it.  That's why I do the weather.  I don't read that stuff.  It is so cold.  It is so cold.  It's cold in here, too.  Take a shot at the weather if you want to.  I don't know.  I'm good with that.  Hey, dude.  I get paid either way.  It's so cold for the weather to start today.  And it will be a day where it will be a cold day. 
[00:35:00]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  I like the weather, man.  I wanted to pay attention before.  I just heard...  He mocked him.  He mocked him in the middle of it.  I just heard...  And the weatherman comes off looking like a fun guy, and the other guy looks like an  absolute douche.  And he's calling him Billy.  Yeah, why don't you try it, Billy?  Why don't you try it, Billy?  Hey, Billy boy.  We so lucked out.  That was a good one.  We were just recording today.  We lucked out.  It was like Ben cackling.  Then he gets up and takes his monstrous hog and points at the weatherman. 
[00:35:30]  It's going to be cold here.  Where?  He's pointing to Alaska and Idaho at the same time.  That's great, isn't it?  That is really good.  These stupid news readers, they take their jobs way too seriously, and they don't want  you pointing out that they flubbed something.  Anyway, yeah, this happened while we were off the air.  Steve Bartlestein, who was in that clip with Bill Evans, the weather guy.  New sex suit hits anchor. 
[00:36:00]  Transmitted various communicable diseases, according to the New York Post.  What?  Who did?  It looks like Steve Bartlestein.  Oh.  I don't know.  This is August 5th, 03.  WABC-TV news anchor Steve Bartlestein is being sued by a second man for sexual harassment and  stalking.  A man?  Yeah, that's what we're saying.  With the laser pointer and all that.  Actor Dan Levine claims Bartlestein followed him to Boston and Denver.  That guy we just heard in the clip followed this other guy to Boston and Denver, forcing 
[00:36:30]  him to switch hotels under an assumed name.  Wow.  This lawsuit is the second of its kind for Bartlestein, who was hit earlier this year  with a sexual harassment complaint by ABC writer-producer Roderick McCollum.  Rod.  Why don't you try it, Rod?  Yeah.  What a short-fused fruit.  Wow, really?  Why don't you stop rubbing your mule on other co-workers and get a sense of humor, sissy?  Why don't you leave the weatherman alone? 
[00:37:00]  He's having a ball over there.  He's laughing.  Don't be just having fun, cackling in the background.  No, it's insane.  It's crazy.  It's Melania knows.  And then he starts gossiping about it.  Yeah, she was doing coke with Tom Brady in Boston.  Yeah, I do.  No, speaking of Boston, low-pressure system.  Well, he would only give the Boston weather.  He wouldn't even mention the tsunami.  Stupid Ben.  No matter what city he was in, he would just go, eh, they're Boston.  And how it affects either the Pats or the Red Sox.  What a Boston nothing he is.  Who, Ben?  Yeah.  Oh, an ass of epic proportions. 
[00:37:30]  So, there you have it, man.  That's great.  Yeah.  And you know, Steve was just pissed off, and Evans can't stop laughing.  They're still pissed.  What, are you kidding?  You know they're still pissed.  All right.  And then we should follow that up.  We have audio of an anchor fight at KABC TV in L.A.  Now, this was before they went to air.  Well, obviously, you know what?  These engineers, they're great.  They're always recording, you know, when they're not on.  You know what I mean?  That's why I get a little nervous when we're mic'd for something. 
[00:38:00]  Of course.  Like yesterday, we get mic'd up for the talk show, and I don't like discussing other people,  other things, or anything when I'm mic'd, because you know these guys.  And you know these engineers are recording and hoping you're going to say something stupid,  and then they trade with their friends all over the country.  Right.  And eventually, you know, someone...  It ends up on a CD on some radio show.  Yeah, because someone sends it to an...  Yeah, exactly.  So, yeah, this is just before they go to air.  And obviously, these two just hate each other and have a problem.  Problems.  And a lot of guy-girl teams in any broadcasting forum usually don't like each other. 
[00:38:30]  I've got to explain, the neighborhood I live in, these people that read the news, Anthony,  you know, between the 6 o'clock and 11 o'clock, they've got like four or five hours,  because they're really just reading the news.  It's the people behind the scenes that have to put the whole thing together for these guys  and throw it on a teleprop.  So, what happens with these anchors and the sports guys and the weather guys?  Some teleprompter.  Oh, what did I say?  Teller?  You can throw that in on there.  What do you call it?  What?  What?  Teleprop?  You want to take another shot at that word? 
[00:39:00]  All I heard was...  Where were we?  Oh, yeah.  So, in my hood there, you know, it's near one of these news stations, and these guys hang  out at coffee shops and smoke cigars and eat in between the 6 and 11 o'clock news.  Yeah.  And a lot of these anchors and news people and stuff, they have family, so they actually  go home for a few hours, because they have nothing to do until they have to read again  off that thing that shows the words.  So, I think what's going on in this clip is the female anchor goes home. 
[00:39:30]  For like, in between the newscasts.  I believe so, because the male anchor kind of brings up her drinking.  He eludes.  He eludes that she might be drinking in between the newscasts.  This is brutal.  Oh, I didn't hear this.  Yeah, this is brutal.  You thought the one we just played was good?  Listen to this exchange just before they hit the air, Jimmy.  First segment.  It's done that way all the time.  It frequently is.  It frequently is.  Well, then we better talk about it.  You'll hear me complaining about it. 
[00:40:00]  Then we better talk about it.  Tonight I'm complaining, because tonight I said, wait.  Then we better talk about it, because I think you've got a problem.  I agree.  I think we've got a problem.  All right?  If that's what you think, then we'll talk about it after the show, and we'll talk about  it with Roger Bell, because I'm not going to sit here night after night and put  up with this shit.  Okay?  Night after night?  Night after night?  Well, it looks to me like that's the way it's going to go, Andy.  I'm going to take the ante up a little higher than that, even.  You're not only wrong, you're way out of line. 
[00:40:30]  Let me tell you something.  You started it, pal.  If you want Harold Green, you might get him.  That's fine with me.  Fine with me.  Good old Harold Green.  Okay.  Okay.  You want to start dealing with shit?  Go ahead.  That's what you want.  You just might get it.  You know, you go home and have a couple of shooters, and I don't know what the fuck happens,  but when you come back, you're not the same lady.  That's not true.  Some nights it is, Ann.  When news happens, you'll see it happen on Channel 7. 
[00:41:00]  The number one station for news and information in Southern California.  Now, Paul Moyer, Ann Martin, Johnny Mountainweather, and Todd Donahoe-Sport.  This is Eyewitness News Tonight.  Three men dead tonight in an execution-style murder in Los Angeles.  Go right into it.  The lush sitting next to me will explain.  Wow.  Isn't that great?  That was just before they hit the air. 
[00:41:30]  And she kept, you know what it is?  She's such a drunk.  She kept talking when he was trying to say something, and he just had enough of her mouth.  Yep.  Was he stapling things, or?  I don't know.  It sounded like something just slamming him down on the desk.  He was shuffling his papers, I think, and just hitting the desk, right?  Oh, he's just kind of like putting them down hard.  Slapping them down.  There is a problem there, boy.  We'll have to work in that environment.  Who are those names you kept mentioning?  You're going to get this?  I'll probably, you know, the boss.  The boss, yeah.  The program director, whatever, that runs the newsroom. 
[00:42:00]  Are they still together, or you don't know?  Are they still a team?  I don't know.  I don't know the history of that clip.  Steve might know.  Eric, what's the history of that clip, please?  He's going to just say, I don't know.  Don't know.  Sorry?  He's just going to say, I don't know.  Tell him that he got it.  Getting back to the Steve Bartlestein, we've got more.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you Google his name, you find some fun stuff.  That was the first clip we played.  Worst off-camera behavior.  WABC News anchor Steve Bartlestein, who is being sued by two men for sexual harassment.  One of the men is an ABC News producer.  The court documents include juicy bits of information. 
[00:42:30]  One of the men claims that Bartlestein uses crystal meth and crack every day,  and knowingly transmitted various communicable diseases.  Oh, testy anchor with chlamydia.  How annoying is that?  Self-righteous and disease-ridden.  How is he still an anchor?  I know.  Like the slightest little thing.  Well, that guy yesterday, the weatherman in Vegas, made quite the little faux pas.  We don't have audio of this, but...  Oh, Anthony, yeah, here, I'll give that to you.  What a faux pas this guy made, and right out the door. 
[00:43:00]  And meanwhile, you get this guy in New York.  He's eating chlamydia and crack and stalking, and he's still delivering the news.  And snippy to boot.  Las Vegas, a weekend television weatherman was fired after he made an on-air racial slur  about Martin Luther King Jr., station official said.  Rob Blair, Rob Blair, from a KTNV-TV, was delivering the extended forecast Saturday morning 
[00:43:30]  when he said, and I quote, for tomorrow's 60 degrees, Martin Luther Kuhn King Jr. Day.  Going to see some temperatures in the mid-60s.  So, it sounds like he said Martin Luther Kuhn, and then went King Jr.  You've got to be fired for that.  I despise political correctness, but you know what, when you say Martin Luther Kuhn on television  on his birthday, you've got to go. 
[00:44:00]  Sometimes political correctness has a point.  Now, some say, some would say, well, obviously it was a slip of the tongue.  I don't think anybody in their right mind would go on television and say this.  Yes.  On purpose.  But, I guess there's, if it was a slip of the tongue, why would you even make it, unless  you've been saying it all day?  You know, it's kind of one of those slips that you just, I don't know, Luther, kind of  has that ooh sound to it, going into a king, you might, have you ever done that? 
[00:44:30]  You cross up two words.  Constantly.  But, you know, yeah, this is one of those, how do you explain it?  It could have been the most innocent slip in the world, but.  Sounds like he was going to say cool.  No, oh, you heard it.  No, I don't know.  It just seems like he was, you know.  Well, it sounds like Martin Luther, and then you've got that ooh from Luther stuck in your  head.  You go to king, starts with a k sound, and you're already halfway through coon.  He was probably just joking with his friend, saying, yeah, Martin with a coon tomorrow.  Just joking around.  I've mixed up words before. 
[00:45:00]  Like, a lot of times a girl will say, you're going to tell me, right?  And I'll say yes, but what I really mean is, no.  You'll find out when your tonsils are bleachy, stupid.  Oh, let's see.  Jim Prather, vice president and general manager, said Blair stumbled, but the excuse was not  good enough to save his job.  This kind of incident is not acceptable under any circumstances, and I'm truly sorry that  this event occurred, Prather told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. 
[00:45:30]  Blair apologized, waddle-doodle, during the station, 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscast.  So the guy got on twice after that and apologized.  On a weather report early this morning, I made an accidental slip of the tongue when  talking about the Martin Luther King Coon holiday.  No, he didn't say that.  He actually got it right that time.  He said the Martin Luther King holiday.  And what I said was interpreted by many viewers as highly offensive.  Interpreted?  No, it was highly offensive.  For that, I offer my deepest apology. 
[00:46:00]  I in no way intended to offend anyone.  I'm very sorry.  Waddle-doodle.  Well, he also said in an interview, he said, I don't want you to think I was happy.  It's not like I got up and danced a jig.  Oh, which he was fired again.  Blair worked at the station for about three months, so he's kind of new meat over there.  Yeah, yeah.  It's kind of spooky.  I have a new guy doing that.  All right.  Well, they didn't like him around the office anyway.  He never bought lunch.  He behaved very niggardly. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, wow.  Yes.  That means cheap, I believe.  Yes, it does.  Hey, Cal, what's up?  Hey, I used to live out in Southern California and used to watch the news out there, and Ann  Martin is a blonde.  You're kind of an attractive older lady.  I'd do it if I had a chance, but Paul Martin's just a fucking asshole.  Are they still on the air?  Are.  Are they still on the air?  They're still on the air, yeah.  They're still on the air.  They're that green guy who used to be a news anchor, and now he's like a director or something  like that. 
[00:47:00]  All right.  How's her drinking problem?  What's that?  How's her drinking coming along?  Yeah, he referred to her as a drinker.  She does a few shoots.  She doesn't seem like that.  She just seems like one of them little sophisticated older ladies.  These guys in the news anchors out in L.A. are so stuck on themselves, thinking they're going  to get some kind of Hollywood bullshit that it don't even make sense.  Hey, Dan Aykroyd, voice.  How long ago did you live in California?  I lived in Southern California pretty much my entire life.  I live up in Utah now, but it's been only a couple years back. 
[00:47:30]  You ever live in Cook County, Chicago, did you?  Not yet, Jimmy.  All right.  Thank you, Cal.  Cook County, Chicago.  God bless you now, thanks.  Not a bad-looking older broad.  Steve is saying that that clip is 10 years old?  No.  Yeah, it has to be, because Moyer and Martin weren't at that news, weren't at ABC since  1994.  Wow.  Are they still a team?  No.  No.  One of them's at CBS, one of them's at ABC.  Well, our clip is two hours old.  Exactly.  We really lucked out on that today.  Okay.

Well, sunshine's moving into the western United States after all those areas picked up so  much snow, so they're still powder skiing at Mammoth, and a lot of the bowls toward the  top are in great shape.  They got 15 inches of snow this week.  All 150 trails were open there.  Timberline in Oregon with 27 inches of snow over the last 72 hours in wonderful shape as 
[00:49:00]  they're on 75% of their terrain with a six-foot base.  Fine April skiing in Oregon.  The Canyons End, Deer Valley, and Utah with two to three feet of snow over the past week  have plenty of knee-deep and waist-deep powder.  And Aspen and Breckham Ridge in Colorado both got 10 inches of snow over the past few days.  If eastern areas could avoid the storm this week and they'd have some nice spring skiing,  snowshoe mountains staying open until April 10th.  They're still on 70% of their terrain.  Sunday River, Maine with 50 miles of soft, wet, granular snow.  I'm Chuck Devine with the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report. 
[00:49:30]  It's everything 24-7.  XM 202.  The O&A virus.  It's everything all the time.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Aw.  Hey, do we have the Entertainment Tonight music, or could they play it in New York?  Because you've got to do the Entertainment Tonight voice for the Pat O'Brien story.  Do we have the hack-puker voice?  Do we have it, or?  It's beyond puker, isn't it?  What?  That voice that that woman does for one of the entertainment shows, 
[00:50:00]  it's just that she, it's not human.  We're waiting, we're waiting, we're waiting, we're waiting, we're waiting, we're waiting.  Pat O'Brien.  News today on Pat O'Brien.  Pat O'Brien faces his demons of alcohol and checks into a rehab facility.  For years, Pat O'Brien has reported on problems facing Hollywood stars,  formerly on Yaxias Hollywood, 
[00:50:30]  more recently on his new show, The Insider.  Now, the former Chicago Spearscaster is facing his own demons.  I've had problems with Yaxias Hollywood.  How many syllables can they cram in a word?  This is a great thing Pat is doing,  said long-time old Brian friend and associate one day.  He's finally facing up to something many of us had known was a... 
[00:51:00]  for a long time.  He's facing up to it.  Pat O'Brien.  So he's an alcoholic.  He's an alky, but, Opie, that isn't the whole story.  Apparently, he checked into this rehab facility because he knew...  Are you saying we're going to go inside the story?  Inside the inside scuorin.  Oh, that's not all.  That's not all.  But this story has an even darker skill wide. 
[00:51:30]  It seems Pat's a few yucking pervures.  This guy gets all tanked up and makes phone calls.  And, uh, oops, one of them gets taped.  Now, Pat O'Brien's married, right?  I guess so.  Pat O'Brien married and he was getting drunk,  calling, uh, this woman and trying to work out a threesome with him, his wife, and, uh, and this woman. 
[00:52:00]  Is this 1998?  No, it's not 1998.  Oh, okay.  I just got a little confused.  Pat O'Brien.  It's now.  Oh, Pat O'Brien.  I'm sorry.  It's now.  Yes, I'm really sorry.  I seem to remember something very similar, but maybe I'm having just that deja vu weird thing that happens to you.  Never checked into rehab.  Jesus.  1998, huh?  I mean, uh, 2005.  2005.  I'm a little confused.  2005.  Oh, yeah.  It says right on USA Today. 
[00:52:30]  March 22nd, 2005.  Right.  Okay.  Ha, ha.  We'll read the court documents of Anthony.  Ha, ha, ha.  Who settled the case right when this testimony made its scene in court.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh.  Got a post and daily news report is sitting in the courtroom.  Oh, Anthony, is it true that you tried to invite other women into your...  Settle!  I'll settle.  Give her whatever she wants. 
[00:53:00]  The reporters, you can leave now.  Ha, ha, ha.  They're trying to live like a rock star.  Look what happens.  Ha, ha.  You're such a hero to a lot of people out there.  You know that, right?  You're a hero.  Were there whips involved?  No, no whips.  I don't need to know, Anthony.  I mean, that's your private life.  It was a long time ago, Opie.  It was many, many moons ago.  Ha, ha.  That's right. 
[00:53:30]  I got the DD snort today.  Hey, look at this.  I'm better than Pat.  Pat couldn't close the deal.  All right.  He faces his demons of alcohol, checks into rehab, and once you check into rehab, everything's fine.  Yeah, that's the thing you do in Hollywood.  You could do the most outrageous crap, but you just blame it on the alcohol and the drugs.  You go to rehab, and everyone's like, ah!  Yeah.  Wow, that is weird when that door slams.  I know.  It sucks a lot of the thing out.  Anyway, so we have the audio of Pat O'Brien.  Yeah, that's what I hear. 
[00:54:00]  I haven't heard this yet.  This is the beauty of...  Did you take somebody or no?  I don't know.  Hey, you know something?  It would probably be illegal for us to tape somebody on the phone because of some FCC rules.  But for some reason, when these tapes get out, you play them anywhere.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Ah, what's the rule?  Ah, who cares?  This is the beauty of satellite radio.  No one else is going to give you the unedited version, right?  Unedited.  I hear some racy talk from Pat O'Brien.  I like to call it saucy.  Saucy?  Wow.  It's saucy stuff.  I like racy, but saucy...  Racy is dirty. 
[00:54:30]  Saucy is sexy.  Racy involves a black woman.  Yeah?  I don't know.  Saucy.  Let's try it out.  No, nothing.  Nothing.  This is risque.  Risque is boring.  Saucy.  I like saucy talk.  You take your wine, a little sugar, put in your meat.  You may have to talk 30 to 100 guys one day.  Oh, no.  The showstopper's going to talk again.  Oh, here we go.  Oh, no.  I actually heard the audio this morning.  Uh-huh.  On the way down here, I didn't have a room, so I shared a room with...  Describe the whole scene of going into the room, turning on the recorder. 
[00:55:00]  I happened to share a room with Steve, and this morning I was laying in bed, and Steve  was playing the audio on his laptop, and certain things you just don't want to hear when you're  alone in a room with Steve when you're half asleep, and...  Oh, did you go...  I absolutely did, because when you hear the beginning of this phone call and some of the  things he's saying, I thought it was Steve, and it was a little scary.  That's highly unlikely, but all right.  Where's your other hand?  Between two pillows. 
[00:55:30]  Those aren't instant replay machines.  All right, Pat O'Brien.  All right, Steve, are we ready for the big exclusive?  We're the only show that can play the unedited version of this.  Now, what if we want to stop this?  Just cue me.  And talk.  We'll point to Steve.  Yeah.  In the old days, I would just stop the tape, Anthony, but, you know.  Point at that cuddly face.  This means stop.  Okay, Jim.  Thank you.  All right. 
[00:56:00]  What are you doing, Steve?  Oh.  Oh, you dicks.  You're just going to screw with them.  You didn't fall for that, did you?  Yeah.  You just both did the big stupid stops.  But there's obviously...  Five feet behind you.  I don't want to stop like that.  Wow.  Yeah, rewind that, Steve.  God, that was too easy.  And get the Pat O'Brien clip, not the Joaquin Phoenix clip from the village.  You guys suck.  All right.  All right.  Well, why don't we go to the tape?  So this is Pat O'Brien making a drunken phone call to a girl that he's trying to get  in bed with his either girlfriend or his wife. 
[00:56:30]  I don't know if he's really married or whatever.  So...  Let's hear.  I'll get you next time.  I don't want to fucking go crazy with you.  So, I don't want to fucking go crazy with you.  To copy this message to another person, press 6.  To delete this message and go to the next, press 7.  To keep the...  Saved message, Sunday, 7.09 p.m. 
[00:57:00]  You are so fucking hot.  And I want to be you.  I don't want you to suck my car.  I want to fuck you.  I don't want my girlfriend to eat you.  You're so fucking hot.  You are fucking hot.  Let's do it.  You are so fucking hot.  Please leave me a voicemail.  Go to the bathroom and leave me a voicemail. 
[00:57:30]  Bye.  All right.  Hold on a minute, Steve.  I just got to soak that in.  What an ass.  He left these on a machine.  Could someone get me the address for the insider?  There's a job opening over there.  Oh, my God.  There is no way he's coming back from that.  How could he come back?  And can I say he's awful at talking dirty?  Oh.  You're so fucking hot.  Fucking hot.  Miggs was better at it.  He stinks.  I can smell your liquor breath. 
[00:58:00]  What an ass.  He left that on a machine like this woman isn't on a cell phone.  Did he say, suck my cock?  Oh, yeah.  He said he wanted to eat her and wanted her to suck his cock.  And then he said, go do the traffic.  Oh, my God.  Is there more?  That's hard to come back from.  Yeah, there's another four minutes of this.  Oh, my God.  I'm hanging.  Let's go.  Guys, great. 
[00:58:30]  Someone says it sounds like Florentine.  Yeah.  Special.  Okay.  Save message Sunday, 7, 48 p.m.  God, I'm so fucking into you.  But Betsy's so jealous.  But I fucking have sex.  And I want to lick your pussy and suck your tits.  But you have to be into Betsy.  I told Betsy that you were into her.  And if you get this message, just look at me and say yes. 
[00:59:00]  God, I want to fucking lick your pussy and make you cum so much.  And get crazy.  I don't know why I'm like this.  But I don't want you badly.  I know you want me.  But you have to be into Betsy, too.  So I'm going to get this message.  If you agree with me.  Say yes.  Oh, wow.  First, the worst part is that you're fucking a girl named Betsy. 
[00:59:30]  You've got to be with old Betsy.  Dude, your mic is messing up.  I know it is.  That is unbelievable.  That guy is so completely in a froth.  That guy is in a fucking tizzy over this chick.  He's probably like popping Viagra like they're Tic Tacs.  And now he just has a raging heart on.  This guy cannot control himself.  He's thinking about this.  He can't even keep it in his head. 
[01:00:00]  He's got to call this woman and tell her.  He's imagining licking her and doing it to him.  And he cannot even deal.  How did these tapes get out?  This woman, whoever he left the messages on, saved them all.  Obviously thought it was newsworthy.  Why?  What happened?  Apparently she was flipping through the television one night at 7.30.  And so, hey, wait a minute.  I've talked to him before.  Hey, I know this guy.  I think I have the tapes.  Oh, my God.  How old are these tapes?  I don't know.  Any date on them? 
[01:00:30]  Do we have any info on these tapes at all, Steve?  No.  I got sent a link and that was it.  No background info.  Now, what's the reason that she released these tapes?  Do you know the back story?  We don't really know much about this, huh?  This showed up in the email.  It's just, Pat O'Brien talks dirty, drunk, and coked up.  That was the link I got.  And he said if you hear this message and you see me just nod and smile.  Yeah.  Is that mic fading in and out or no?  It's okay.  No, you're all right.  Okay.  You got to stay on mic a little more.  Are we the only ones playing these tapes today?  I think so. 
[01:01:00]  Maybe she personally sent it to us.  She's a fan of the show.  I'm sure it's us and Betsy.  We're the ones who are.  Betsy.  You got to be with Betsy, though.  I call Betsy.  Betsy's so jealous.  Betsy.  I want to lick your pussy.  You heard it here first, folks.  Pat O'Brien facing his demons.  He wants to lick her pussy.  You heard a horny Pat O'Brien right here exclusively on the Opium Yantam Yantam Show.  Pat O'Brien, that horny fucker, he just wants to lick her pussy. 
[01:01:30]  He can't even take it.  And then we also heard him say, he wants her to suck his cue yuck.  He wants to make her cum over and over again as he licks her pussy.  He wants to lick her tits.  Pat O'Brien, horny old bastard.  Can he get Betsy in on the whole situation?  We'll find out later in the B'Yantam Yantam. 
[01:02:00]  On Inside Edition, he wants to stick his tongue inside her pussy.  We got more, Steve?  Will Betsy say yes?  Yeah, well, let's see what happens.  Maybe it's a whole, maybe there's a conclusion to this.  Here we go.  He doesn't even know if she's into this or not. 
[01:02:30]  This idiot is just leaving these messages saying, if you agree with this, just wink at me?  Wow.  Well, she must work with him or something, right?  What a risk.  Well, she's just going to walk down the hall and just give him a nod?  I have a pertinent question in this whole situation. 
[01:03:00]  Yes, Anthony?  How are we sure this is Pat O'Brien?  It sounds like him.  It does sound like him.  Look at the voice, man.  I understand.  Oh, no, I will not say it doesn't sound like him.  But how are we sure enough to play this as Pat O'Brien, not having any confirmation?  There's no news.  I thought this was attached to a news story that Pat O'Brien's sex tapes have leaked out.  Are we going to be part of a story later today, Steve?  Jesus.  Steve, I thought this was part of a story that was out in the news that these tapes have surfaced. 
[01:03:30]  That's why he's in rehab, blah, blah, blah.  Hey, we got a huge audience in there all over the country.  Hey, guys, is anyone else playing the Pat O'Brien?  You know, if your morning show is playing him, phone in.  We'd like to hear it.  Yeah, because right now I think we're committing some kind of crime.  It's actually Pat from Moondaki.  And the last tape, you're going to hear Pat go, just wink.  Now, you know, hey, I like it as much as the next guy.  This is really funny stuff. 
[01:04:00]  But are we now alleging that this is Pat O'Brien?  I miss his playing him as well.  I miss his playing it?  Yeah, but he can't play him like we're playing him.  Yeah, I got to edit all the fun stuff out.  You just imagine.  A bunch of bleeps and bloops.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Here's Pat O'Brien talking about boop jobs.  It stinks.  Wish I was on the satellite.  Satellite.  I'm no dummy.  I'm sorry.  Don't talk to me like that.  I'm Imus. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, yeah, satellite.  You were right.  I'm a dick.  Boy, I like to eat your pussy.  You can't suck in my cock.  I'll lick your tits.  Yeah, yeah, baby.  Yeah, so just wink at me when I'm walking by or something.  If I tip my cowboy hat at you, it means I want to fuck you.  I miss in the morning.  Yeah, yeah, baby. 
[01:05:00]  Jesus, dude, that's a really good impression.  When I have my, look, I want to jiggle my turkey neck at you.  All right, look, I'm going to teabag you.  And my testes hang real low because I'm an old man.  And if you want that, just wink at me, baby.  Because I want to lick that pussy and suck those tits, baby.  Baby!  Moby Worm coming to get you.  I want to do a Billy Saul Hargis bit while you suck my cock.  Moby Worm's coming to get you out of my pants. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, shut up, jerk.  All right, how many more minutes of this illegal tape are we playing?  It might be Pat O'Brien tape.  The Daily News picked up on it, too, and we're printing the article now.  Oh, okay.  We've got three minutes left.  Yeah, we cover our asses as we're doing it after the break.  Hey, it's me.  I am so fucking into you.  And you have to pay attention to Betsy, but let's have fun. 
[01:06:00]  I want to fucking eat you and fuck you and suck your tits and watch you eat Betsy and lick your ass.  I'm so fucking into you.  It's incredible.  Wow.  That's the ass lick.  Check this message and then just say to me, yes, and just can watch us.  Let's just fucking have fun.  I'm so fucking into you.  It's fucking hot. 
[01:06:30]  And I don't do this for a lick.  It's just like new to me.  But I want to fucking make you crazy.  You are with those phone calls, you nut.  You're a kook.  You're driving me crazy, okay?  And just the signals he wants, if you're into this, just breathe while you're in the office.  Just when the phone rings, pick it up and say hello.  Yeah.  Yes.  You know why he's using the blinking and the breathing and all that?  Because he's actually talking to Mary Shivo. 
[01:07:00]  I wonder if he's not talking to his sister, Terry, who's actually in the news lately.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  Still funny, though.  It's hilarious.  Damn.  Most people were laughing.  That was very funny.  They made the connection until you had a...  I had to.  Crushed my little phone.  Mary Shivo.  Is her sister named Mary, at least?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  But listen, back to the Frank O'Brien tapes.  Here it is. 
[01:07:30]  Here's the story from the Daily News.  Hosts rehab.  Hold the phone.  What's the inside story on insider host Pat O'Brien's decision to enter rehab Sunday?  Hollywood sources suggest the timing was to defuse the release of several sexually explicit voicemail messages available on the Internet yesterday soliciting sex from an unidentified woman.  And then in quotes, let's just bleeping have sex and fun and drugs and go crazy.  Oh, we didn't get to that part yet. 
[01:08:00]  Says the male voice.  Yesterday's reps for the insider would not comment on widespread attribution of the voice to O'Brien.  The tape describes in graphic detail just how badly the caller wants various activities that involve, gosh, all parts of a woman's body.  I'm so into you.  Betsy is so effing jealous, the voice claims in one message.  You know you want me, but you have to be with Betsy, too.  The insider host has one child with his wife, Linda. 
[01:08:30]  Hmm.  Who's Betsy?  I don't know.  Sadly, by the final message, Betsy seems to have pulled out of the threesome.  Oh, they ruined it!  You just ruined it.  They spoiled it!  You don't have to say that part.  Yeah, but I was reading it.  Who's Linda?  Well, then I won't read the last quote.  Ooh.  A little spoiler.  Ooh, Anthony.  Wow, that's something. 
[01:09:00]  All right, why don't we go back to the tape?  All right, let's continue with the Pat O'Brien messages.  So, come.  Saved message, Sunday, 9.04 p.m.  Hey, it's me.  Um, you're so fucking hot.  We know.  Wait, wait.  All right, Pat.  Can I point out one thing?  Yeah.  The first message was 7.09.  The next one was 7.54.  This one is 9.04.  He has been jerking off for two hours calling his wife. 
[01:09:30]  Not only that, he's got to be doing a lot of coke, because a lot of these messages are  one after another, you know?  Oh, yeah.  It's just, come on.  Come on.  It's just coke's and heart-ons.  You are so fucking hot.  He's grinding his teeth.  His cock is three, maybe three quarters of an inch, and he can't get hard, and he's  trying to grab it and make it hard.  Come on.  Yeah, you're so fucking hot.  Come on, cock.  Work.  Work.  Don't think of Betsy.  He's on a coke binge.  Anthony on Long Island, we're not going to go to the phones, because they're really  screwed up today, but he writes, O&A are like Dan Rather with their source checking. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, look at us.  That seems to be Pat O'Brien.  It sounds like him.  What the hell?  Why not run it?  It's news.  Let's go back to the tape.  It's just like, all of a sudden, not into it, but the truth is to get together.  I want to fucking suck your pussy.  Fuck good, it's you.  Watch him, Betsy, eat each other. 
[01:10:30]  Shuck my cock.  Yeah, it's going down to the checklist.  Jerk off in your face.  Do what?  Jerk off in your face.  Get another woman up.  Is there anybody who doesn't want to fuck?  I want to put my cock in all the 150,000 dead tsunami victims.  I want to eat your pussy.  Have a hooker.  Jesus Christ.  Holy shit. 
[01:11:00]  I want to fuck Salvi.  Fuck Vicky.  Fuck me while you're at it.  I want to fuck Tattalia, Fonzini, Stracci, and Salvi fuck Bessie.  That's like Pat O'Brien's cock.  It was bigger than yours.  Today, I settle all of my cock's business.  He was bagging trucks at a way just two at a time. 
[01:11:30]  He was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world.  Oh, Betsy Lynn, the path of essence.  Wow, that guy, he's lost his mind.  Oh, my God.  He's all coked up, drunk off his ass, and just horny.  Imagine how much clear stuff is on his hand.  Dude, it's like this.  He's grabbing it with the lower part, like his pinky, and that part, the second two fingers, 
[01:12:00]  he's just grabbing the helmet and flipping off the helmet because he can't get a rock  because he's doing blow for six hours.  He's the greatest.  Wow.  Let's go back to the tape.  There's still more.  He is the greatest.  When you get this message, if you agree with this, just look at me and say yes.  I'm so fucking hot.  I don't know what's wrong with me. 
[01:12:30]  I don't do this.  But I fucking want to just fucking make you crazy.  Make you fucking crazy.  I have to convince Betsy that you're under her.  I'm going to watch you guys make out.  Come on, let's get this message, if you agree with me. 
[01:13:00]  I mean, I don't know why my phone doesn't take messages, by the way.  I'm going to have any of these fucking hookers, too.  Let's just fucking have sex and fun and drugs.  Fuck.  Me.  Go crazy.  Bye.  Let's just kill people.  Let's just murder people.  Let's drive drunk.  Let's put on trench coats and walk into a high school.  Jesus Christ.  Fuck the dead bodies.  Oh, God.  What I like to chop your head off is skull fuck you.  Oh, I just want to put white powder in an envelope and dump it in your face and fuck you all. 
[01:13:30]  Betsy needs a hooker's ass.  If you agree with this, when I see you, walk by me in the hallway.  Don't punch me in the face.  Dan O'Brien stinks.  He's the worst.  Clark from whackbag.com.  He writes on the instant feedback.  She's going to call back after he blows his wad.  What a douche.  I want to fuck your ankle.  I want to suck your fifth vertebrae.  That's great.  I want to put value up your ass and have Betsy suck him out and then blow me and stick him in the tip of my dick. 
[01:14:00]  If you agree with this, when I ask you what time is it, look at your watch.  He really is awful.  He's a redundant ass.  God almighty.  You know, this is a little obscure, but I'm going to go with it anyway.  Sandra Bernhardt in King of Comedy.  Oh, I know.  When, yeah, when Lankford was tied up and she's like, let's go, let's just get crazy.  Let's get crazy.  Yeah.  You drive me crazy, Jerry.  Yeah, that's what it's like.  Let's just get crazy.  Let's get nuts.  It has that same kind of thing. 
[01:14:30]  It has that same.  It's herky jerk.  I want to herky jerk with you and muck my hair up.  Do you want to kiss Betsy on the mouth?  God, why didn't we play this at seven instead of bitch about the equipment?  Oh, this is fantastic.  This is three hours of radio, not ten minutes.  I heard he got all pissed off and called her back after these tapes got out.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  God damn.  That is great.  Oh, how embarrassing. 
[01:15:00]  How completely embarrassing.  Oh, my God.  How do you get around this?  Even rehab.  You know, we were saying you check into rehab, it smooths everything over, but this is a toughie.  This is just a horny, drugged out ass.  This isn't one phone call.  This is 50 with the same things over and over again.  Stalking.  And he's like, Betsy isn't really into it.  And then he goes on like a second later, like, you and Betsy would eat each other.  I want to know, what did she do that gave him a signal that this is what she wanted?  She probably flirted with him once and said, oh, my God, Betsy, oh, my God, what I would do with you two. 
[01:15:30]  And then giggled and walked away.  Good point.  What did she say that warranted this guy calling her like a stalker with filth like this?  He misinterpreted something and just ruined his career.  But with the signals he's telling her to give back, it was probably, you know, I saw you go to the copy machine.  I saw that.  I know what that means.  I want to get Betsy and then just pick up Jane Mansfield's head and eat it.  Jesus Christ, dude.  Get a hold of yourself.  Go out to the desert and beat you with a shovel and bury you.  We'll have a hooker come over and she'll want us to eat her pussy and we won't want to. 
[01:16:00]  So she'll give back 50 and then leave the room.  It was horrible.  Should we go back to the tape?  Oh, you betcha.  You know how it's going to start.  Let's hear the next message.  Oh, you're so fucking hot.  I want to fuck you.  There's only 14 seconds left.  Lick you.  Oh, we're down to the last 14?  Yeah, I think that.  I think we're almost done with it, but here's the last bit.  All right.  That's it, huh? 
[01:16:30]  That's it, huh?  Did he say kids can watch?  What?  He didn't say.  Bring the kids in on it, too.  I don't care.  I want Adam Walsh's head in my lap while you suck my cock.  Wow.  That's gold.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they don't suck.  Good for what ails you.  What, what?  The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:17:00]  Rock.  And we got Shannon.  We're calling her.  Author of The Best You'll Ever Have.  What Every Woman Should Know About Getting and Giving.  Knock Your Socks Off Sex.  So is it going to be the whole...  Hi, guys.  How are you doing?  The perky, very up.  I think she'll be very business-like.  You think?  Yes.  I think they have to be like, hi.

Who doesn't is right, you know?  So what's going on there, Shannon?  Not much.  The book is called The Best You'll Ever Have.  Yep.  With a very, very long subtitle.  Well, can I ask you a question?  Yeah.  Hi, this is Connor.  Um, the, the, it's, myth number one. 
[01:19:00]  You have a section here on sexual myths?  Uh-huh.  What is this about?  Uh, tush sex is for gay men.  Oh.  Yeah, that's, that's a big myth.  Oh, I thought you were saying that it was.  Oh, that's a myth.  Hold on.  Yeah, that's a myth.  I thought you were saying that it was, I thought you were saying that it was, um, that it was  actually only for gay men.  No, no.  That would be part of the myth list.  Oh, so that's something that is, uh, knock your socks off, uh, uh, type of sex?  Yeah, that's actually something that, that I think people ought to talk about more. 
[01:19:30]  For women, they think, well, why would I want something up my butt when I have a perfectly  good vagina?  Right, exactly.  Especially if you're going to hit logs.  Yeah.  So you have to kind of think it through and think why that makes sense in order to convince  yourself to give it a go.  And why does that make sense?  Yeah, why does it make sense there, uh, Shannon?  It makes sense for women because there's a muscle called the PC muscle that goes from  your pubic bone to your tailbone, like a hammock, and all of that muscle is filled  with nerve endings.  Every human being who has an orgasm has, uh, their butt twitch, you know? 
[01:20:00]  It's all connected.  Anthony and I have this thing, though.  We think, uh, butt sex should be left for the young.  How old is too old to have butt sex?  Right.  For the young only.  You're a bit saucy.  A little, uh, you're a bit saucy for our program, but that's okay.  There's actually a good line here, too.  This is pretty funny.  It's about the G spot, and it says here, the search party begins, hold on, what page 
[01:20:30]  is this?  It's, uh, it says, break out the rubber gloves, kidding, about looking for the G spot.  Now, hold on, this is page 51.  Yeah.  Is that a problem that most men have?  Finding the G spot?  That's a problem most women have, too.  So where is this?  Really?  So where is this G spot?  Yeah, I'll tell you, because I finally came up with a way to explain it that I think is  pretty simple.  There's a picture in the book that you can't misunderstand.  What page?  What page?  Yeah, what? 
[01:21:00]  It's two pictures in a row.  Let me just flip through.  Oh, hold on.  I got it right here.  There's one with a finger.  With a finger.  I have page 49.  It's a diagram of the G spot.  Is that it?  That's right.  49 and 53.  Oh, two pages.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You'll look at 49, then you'll look at...  Let me get 49.  Hold on.  All right.  So we show it first, like, in relationship to what everyone knows.  Everyone knows the uterus and the ovary.  Right.  Because we had that in school.  So if you're going to explain anything, you have to show that. 
[01:21:30]  Uh-huh.  It says here the G spot.  It also has a picture of the bladder?  Yes.  Exactly.  The bladder.  Because at least we told them that it was in our heads, not mine.  Right.  And for women, the only thing they really remember is the tampon diagram.  True that.  Oh, yeah.  Every box of tampons comes with one of those.  Who doesn't know that?  But that diagram sucks.  So how do you find the G spot?  You shove a couple fingers in there, and then what do you do?  Well, I would start with just one.  Just one.  Just one.  Shock.  That's true.  You don't need to lose your babysitting job right away. 
[01:22:00]  You can reserve the rest of the hand for other activities.  Right, right, right.  So I'll do that.  The motion is the come-hither motion.  Yeah.  Come over here.  Yeah.  So when you're doing that, stop halfway through and take a look at your hand from the side,  and you'll see you're in, like, a perfect C shape.  Yeah.  A perfect C shape.  It's like two and a half inches in toward the belly button, right?  It's toward the belly button side, and it's very, like you said, like two and a half inches.  It's the bottom one-third, so it's not very far in.  And if you press on the pubic bone, which is really the base of your jeans zipper, everyone has a pubic. 
[01:22:30]  Yes, we do.  But behind the pubic bone for women is the G-spot.  So you're trying to get behind that bone.  It's quite spongy, right?  It is.  It's like a ridgy, spongy.  It's erectile tissue.  So if she's in the right frame of mind, the G-spot's there, and you can feel it.  And if she's not in the right frame of mind, if she's nervous or uptight and just not ready yet, it won't really be very prominent. 
[01:23:00]  And the main thing for women is they've felt it here and there, but it makes them nervous because it makes them feel like they're going to pee.  Oh, really?  They'll feel it, and they'll seize up and stop everything instead of knowing they're not going to pee, being able to relax.  So women tend to lose their best orgasm is to fear of peeing.  I like to call that G-spot Connor's headrest.  Yeah.  Headrest?  Yeah, our old Connor here in the studio.  I know.  I'm afraid to go swimming, though.  The book here, now, are you actually, is it released yet? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, it just came out.  Oh!  Time for Christmas.  Where can you get it?  Uh, Barnes & Noble, Amazon.  I think your local bookstores carry it.  Yeah.  Um, hold on.  What, what?  There's tush talk.  There's actually, I'll say one thing.  I like the, uh, there's a tremendous amount of, like, little headings at the top of every, uh, every page.  So it's kind of like, almost like a food for thought type of book.  Oh!  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, you want to go out and go fishing or something with your mom? 
[01:24:00]  And, uh, you know, if you're going to go fishing and maybe only one comes back and two don't.  Right.  How about here?  It says, don't hate, masturbate.  Oh!  That's a pretty good story.  I got.  What's that about?  Well, I started this business called Safina.  Right.  About two years ago.  And, um, Safina is these in-home sex ed salon women.  And we sell sex toys.  Oh!  Oh!  But we call them sexeries.  Accessories for your lust life.  Sexeries!  Like accessories, but only, but only, uh, sex. 
[01:24:30]  Right.  I get it.  Right.  Accessories for your lust life.  I mean, the whole thing about sex in America is still, it's very awkward and uncomfortable.  Like, tush talk.  I mean, the reason we call it that is so you can actually talk about your butt without feeling like a weird person.  Without feeling dirty.  Well, no one wants to listen to their tush.  Plus, it's breath stinks.  Ha!  Yeah!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  All right.  Oh, all right.  Well, what else do you cover that could help us out in the, uh, in the bedroom? 
[01:25:00]  Well, sex toys are something that almost every woman is interested in.  But they need permission to like them.  Uh-huh.  So, if you're married or you're in a long-term relationship, you really should get some.  But make sure they're attractive.  Um.  Don't buy ugly things.  Um, Sharon, what's the difference?  What's the difference between a clit and a penis?  Oh, that's a good question.  What page is that?  I'm sorry to interrupt you, Sharon.  What page is that?  Let's see.  That's in the second chapter.  Uh.  Connor wants to follow along in his own book. 
[01:25:30]  Yes.  Like he followed along his mom to the depths of, uh, well.  That's good.  Uh, it starts off, uh, explaining kind of where the clitoris is and what it's at.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Let me just.  We're looking for the diagram.  There's a great diagram of the difference between a clitoris and a penis.  Oh.  What page?  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.  What page?  I'm trying to follow along the book here.  Still looking for.  Okay.  Here's a good page.  Hold on.  I got to think the cover.  94.  Hold on.  The cover keeps falling off.  Hold on.  All right.  94. 
[01:26:00]  We're at, uh, page 94 here.  All right.  You'd be surprised at how similar the clitoris and the penis are.  Really?  In fact, they're almost exactly the same.  Well, if they're on Jamie Lee Curtis, they are.  Yeah.  Even on your most average woman.  Well, Susan, obviously there's a difference in size, though.  I don't have a page here.  There is a big difference in size, but they operate exactly the same way.  You know, everyone starts off female.  This, I thought, was very surprising when I started this research.  At the seventh week, if you've got a Y chromosome, your vulva closes up, and it becomes testicles 
[01:26:30]  and the clitoris grows.  Oh.  So everyone starts off the same.  So we actually have all the same exact stuff.  And the clitoris operates exactly the same as the penis.  So when blood rushes to the region, the clitoris raises up and gets erect and sticks out from  its foreskin.  How did you learn all this?  This took me about a year and a half.  That's it?  Well, that's all I did. 
[01:27:00]  I interviewed doctors, urologists, dominatrixes, you know, people who know things.  Really?  Let me ask you a question.  Right here, I'm looking at page 150.  It says, I've never had an orgasm.  Yeah.  These are stories of real women.  Why are you laughing at that?  Some girls don't have an orgasm.  I don't believe that.  A lot of people.  Yeah, exactly.  A lot.  I would say less than 10%.  My dad and mom would always fight, and she would always, my mom and I were talking one  time.  I actually just heard the fight from inside the little womb I was staying in. 
[01:27:30]  That they, like, she would never have orgasms.  Right.  I mean, I heard this, it was kind of embarrassing as a kid to hear that, but it's like, I think  times have changed now.  Well, I think men are more in tune with making a woman have an orgasm.  Am I right or wrong?  See, Connor's very interested in your book and learning all he can.  I mean, I just know he's, you know, soaking up every bit of information he can and just  tearing through it.  Yeah.  That's good.  That means he's actually interested in women.  That's good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I am.  I'm very attached to my mother.  I think everyone wants me, you know, because this orgasm thing is not a small problem. 
[01:28:00]  I mean, when I say 10%, I think I'm being conservative.  Wow.  Wow.  Safina.  So, Safina, what kind of advice could you give to the ladies that don't get the orgasms there?  Yeah, orgasms really do start in mind.  Uh-huh.  What's that?  I couldn't hear that.  It's very, very important to relax.  Just relax.  And that's...  Tomo.  Most of the time, if you haven't had an orgasm by the time you're in your 20s, you're pretty  frustrated.  Can't you just get them really...  Tomo.  Can't you get them just really drunk? 
[01:28:30]  Will that help?  Oh, what about alcohol?  It really can't hurt.  I mean, as long as you're not doing anything related to the butt.  I mean, because...  Ah.  Let me ask you...  But you should never be drunk or high.  That's a really bad idea.  Never be drunk or high for the butt.  That's the only way I can take it.  Is tush sex bad for you?  Like, for instance, I used to...  That's another myth.  Shut up.  Yeah, that's...  Because people think, wow, you know, that doesn't seem like it ought to happen.  Because in our culture, it seems so bad.  Yeah.  And they think, well, what if I get all stretched out of shape and I'm in pain? 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Right.  But if it's done properly, with lots of lube and going very slowly...  Right.  Yeah.  It's just another muscle you're exercising.  But if she's crying and saying no...  Yeah, then you probably better quit.  Right by 10.  Really?  Should you stop?  Yeah.  Or should you put the diaper back on?  Absolutely.  I know.  He's being silly.  Yeah.  Oh, Connor.  I'm Sarah.  Sarah?  No, Shannon.  Oh, Shannon.  Okay.  Kofina is the company and Shannon is the company.  Oh, I'm sorry.  That's okay. 
[01:29:30]  I've been calling you up.  Amber was the mistress.  Let's see.  The male G spot equals the P spot.  Yeah.  P dash.  P dash spot.  What does that mean?  The P spot is pretty interesting because, like I was saying, the clitoris and the penis  are the same.  Well, men have a G spot, too, of course, because we have all the same stuff.  It just moves around.  So, you know, where the G spot is right behind the pubic bone and you make this come-hither  motion, the P spot is just a little further back and it's on the backside of the prostate. 
[01:30:00]  So you're saying that men and women are pretty much the same before we're born, but it's just  some type of a chromosome thing?  All right.  And so everything just shifts around.  But what makes women a little bit smarter than we are?  Oh, Connor, they sure are.  They sure are.  We know who the boss at home is unless you have a motor and a boat.  Then we teach you.  Wow. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, one little blonde hair in the front seat.  Dad didn't think.  Okay.  I do have a theory about happiness.  I'd love to try out on you.  Oh, oh.  Well, hold on.  A little experiment.  Perhaps if you agree.  Well, hold on.  Okay.  Here's my theory.  All right.  The reason why I focus on women with Safina and getting them to buy sex toys is because  I think that if women think something's a good idea and socialistic, then we can all do it.  Yeah.  So that if women are having fun, then we can all have fun. 
[01:31:00]  Right.  So my theory is that women are in control of the fun and that women can still have happiness.  Yeah.  What do you think?  I have to agree with you.  I think you're right.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You seem to have culled a lot of knowledge from a lot of people and put it together very  nicely in this book.  Well, thanks.  What have you learned on your own through your own sexual experiences? 
[01:31:30]  Wow.  A lot.  I think I've learned a lot.  Well, I found the kazoo is really distracting.  What's that?  The kazoo is really distracting.  Shoes are distracting?  Is that the kazoo?  Kazoo.  What are you talking about?  Oh.  Something must be bleeding through.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Oh, okay.  I was hearing Christmas music.  We were having Christmas music.  No.  Actually, we don't play Christmas music on our show.  Ever.  Yeah, because we figure all the other radio stations are doing that.  So I don't know what that was.  Oh, okay.  That's good.  Okay.  I don't know what that was. 
[01:32:00]  We had some equipment problems earlier and we do apologize for that.  Oh, that's okay.  I don't know, Shannon, if something was bleeding through from our production facility.  I'm going to sweep this up your ass.  But I pooped from there.  I'm not going to marry you.  What?  I found my G-spot and I lost it and I found it again.  You did?  Yeah, I lost it for like seven years.  Wow.  Where'd you lose it?  You lost your G-spot?  Yeah, I actually thought it was attached to this guy I was dating.  And when we broke up, you know, I thought, wow, that was so great. 
[01:32:30]  I really...  For seven years?  Yeah.  You know, nobody else was able to find it.  Seven years.  It was horrible.  G-spot doesn't work.  Breaking a mirror and then having bad luck, you know?  Uh-huh, yeah.  So I found my G-spot because, you know, I finally found another guy who could find it.  And then I realized it wasn't attached to him.  Where was it?  Was it at the mall?  Oh, my girl.  It was under the couch, Christian.  Oh, Connor. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, my.  She's buried.  Jiminy Cricket.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Well, listeners have a few questions, I think, right?  Great.  Yeah, they're very excited to talk to a...  Sexpert.  A sexpert, right?  Do you call yourself a sexpert?  What is your title?  I'm a sexpert now.  I'm actually the new sexpert for iVillage.  So I'm a real sexpert now.  All right.  What is iVillage?  iVillage is a women's website.  It's, you know, it's like a kind of compilation of magazine articles from Cosmo and all the 
[01:33:30]  major magazines and health issues and sex.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to Ken and...  Hold on a minute.  Let's go to Ken in Virginia.  Stop it or you will not get your snorkel and flippers for Christmas.  Ken?  Yes, sir.  Do you have a question for the sexpert?  Absolutely.  A couple of months ago, a little Connor was looking at a whore's ass and he came down  with a cold afterwards and I was wondering if she found anything in her research that  correlates the two.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:34:00]  That is true.  Connor...  I was performing Tushalingus.  Yeah.  Tushalingus and got a cold?  And he got a cold.  I got a cold.  It's a true story, yes.  Is that possible, Shannon?  That's more than possible, but I don't know if it's related.  Okay.  Huh.  But if you only got a cold, you're lucky.  Well, you can't get anything from that.  It can't happen to me.  All right.  Oh, boy.  We're all having a good life.  Oh, gosh. 
[01:34:30]  What can you get from Tushalingus?  Um, herpes is transmittable.  No, it's not.  Oh, it's from mouth to butt or anywhere.  Is he eating logs bad?  I think you get something called stinkiest tongue-iest.  You know, stink.  I'll show you.  But a cold, you got off easy.  You could have gotten something bad.  All right.  Why don't we say hi to Chris on Long Island?  Chris, you got a question?  Hi.  Good morning, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Good morning, Chris.  Welcome to the program. 
[01:35:00]  Thanks.  Hi, Shannon.  Hi.  Hi.  I just want to let you know that my wife has read a couple of books by Miss Frankel.  She's a huge fan.  She's great, isn't she?  Yeah, yeah.  And I have a question for you.  You were talking about these accessories.  And a friend suggested something I wanted to know.  My wife's teetering.  Maybe I could push her over the edge.  How do you feel about, I'd like her to defecate on a plate, preferably.  On a plate?  Yeah. 
[01:35:30]  And then, you know, maybe she could microwave it.  And when it gets nice and hot, run around the house with it yelling donkey sausage.  Have you heard of this before, this donkey sausage phenomenon?  No.  No, what's that?  Oh, well, it's this new thing, and it's really great.  You just run around with a plate full of, you know, hot, steaming defecation, running  around yelling donkey sausage, donkey sausage, you know, and it's supposedly a great turn-on.  But my wife hasn't, you know, she's kind of on the edge.  She doesn't want to try it.  Well, that's a good question. 
[01:36:00]  Shannon, donkey sausage, yay or nay?  Well, you have to think of, to get anyone to do anything, especially with sex, you have  to think what's in it for them.  Right.  So, now, why is that going to be fun for her?  You have to figure something out.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  I think you have to come up with a reason why that's going to be fun.  Right.  For her.  Well, that's a great question.  I think it's some type of fetish thing he was into.  Yeah, like if he wants to put down plastic bags on the floor and maybe have someone come  over this afternoon at 5.30 and, you know, drop logs on them. 
[01:36:30]  Drop a few logs, right.  For $3.50.  All right, let's go to Eric in Manhattan.  Eric, you have a question?  Yes, I do.  All right.  Quite often I have sex with my wife in a balloon nut.  Yeah.  And when I pull out, I have a little surprise.  Is that safe and how do I clean that?  I think what he's saying is he pulled his, does it say it right?  It's tush sex.  And he pulled it out and it looked like his mule was wearing an Abe Lincoln hat.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, gravy legs.  Right.  Well, one thing's for sure.  It feels like she's got to go to the bathroom. 
[01:37:00]  She does.  So she ought to consider that before you start because that's, you know, it's really not  a holding area.  Right, right.  It's not a holding area.  No.  So there really should be almost nothing in there.  Yeah.  Under normal conditions.  So you should probably ask that in advance.  All right.  That's some good advice, I must say.  Good question.  Serious questions only from our listeners, of course.  Yeah.  Who's this now?  Vivid Empire.  Hey, what's up?  Hi.  I want to know if this is considered a glass coffee table book. 
[01:37:30]  And what is the best way to introduce scat to the woman?  Is this considered a coffee table book?  No, a glass coffee table book.  A glass coffee table book.  You can lay under it and read it.  Right.  Well, listen to it.  Yeah, it's not big enough.  Chuck Berry Records.  It's a big book, so I don't know.  But it does have a really cheerful, chiclet-looking cover.  Right.  So you can read it on the subway, and nobody's going to think of anything. 
[01:38:00]  And what was the second part of your question?  What's the best way to introduce scat to my wife?  Scat.  Like, what, the old singing?  That's what I'm thinking.  I don't know.  Old gravy chest.  Old gravy chest.  Oh, um, you know, having the girl, like, release herself number two on the chest.  What?  Oh, is that what that is?  Is that what scat is? 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, I think so.  The euphemisms are amazing, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  We're trying to keep it clean for broadcast.  Um, dude, is that what scat is, when someone uses your chest as a bowl?  Yeah, so you could even sculpt it, too.  Huh.  Sharon?  Yeah.  I can't, like, I default back to the, why is it going to be fun for her?  Because that's the only way to motivate anyone to do anything.  Well, maybe it's fun for her, because the guy gets so turned on by his fetish.  And she knows that she won't go to bed with a blackened jaw.  Well, that's probably with a blackened jaw, right? 
[01:39:00]  That's always an incentive.  Yeah, really.  I know, really, Connor.  Connor.  I mean, if she really thinks that's going to be fun for you, maybe she could be convinced.  But that's going to be a long shot.  You probably should find somebody who has the same interest.  Right, right, right, right.  All right, we only have time for a few more questions here.  Let's say hi to, it looks like, Andre.  Andre?  Hello, everyone.  How are you today?  Hello, Andre.  Thank you for calling the program.  Thank you.  Thank you, Care Bear.  Shannon, are you there?  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  Okay, good.  I have a question for you.  I'm currently dating another man's girlfriend.  I'm playing a bit of a devil myself, if you understand the font.  But my question is that when, this gentleman, his name is Mark, when I have his girlfriend  over, and she is performing, how I say,  Oral treats?  Yeah, that's a good way.  Oral treats on me.  She tends to have a bit of a gag reflex very quickly.  And I want to know how to kind of maybe work her out of that so I can perhaps put a little 
[01:40:00]  more down, if you understand what I mean.  You understand what I'm saying to you?  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah, how do you get the girls to open their throats?  Yeah, because this one, she seems to not be able to take as much as I want to give her a  cont. What do you think?  Yeah. Well, maybe she's just not going to be able to. It sounds like she's already trying  too hard, or she shouldn't be gagging. She should probably use her hand at the same time.  She does use her hand a little bit, but I try to push more, and not more than two or three 
[01:40:30]  inches going in, and then she tends to have a tough time with that cont. I don't understand  how I can maybe get her to be able to accept more without kind of having a gag reflex or  what do you think?  Yeah, well, if it's too much, it's too much. Maybe it's just too much.  But there's nothing I can do to try to help her get past that?  So she has to, she can use her hand at the same time. But obviously, if it's going too  far, she wouldn't be gagging, because gagging happens pretty far back.  Yeah.  Maybe she's just too small now. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  On Ray? Is that it, On Ray?  On Ray?  On Ray.  He punched out.  Or his phone may have gone out.  I sound like a cellular.  All right. Well, that was very good. Good question. Good answer. We got a couple of  more?  Yeah, let's go to Scott in California.  Scott in Modesto.  Modesto. Scott?  Yes. Hi, little Connor.  Hi.  Hey there. I had a question for Shannon. I got in a little bit of legal trouble, Shannon,  because my wife really wouldn't shut the hell up. And Connor, you were there. You remember 
[01:41:30]  that, right?  I do.  Yes. It was a real issue. She was a pain in my ass. And see, Shannon, I'm surrounded only  by guys now because of my little legal trouble, and because Amber's gone, and my wife is well  not with us. So I was just wondering, now that I'm surrounded by guys, how should I go  about satisfying my desires?  Surrounded by guys? You're in prison?  Yeah, he's in prison. He calls our program a lot.  Yeah.  Okay. I was trying to picture this. 
[01:42:00]  I know. He's been in for about a year, now.  And a lot of the things that he enjoyed doing, fishing, things like that, he's not able to  do anymore. So I guess he wants to enjoy himself.  Is it normal to go gay because you're in prison, I guess, is what he wants to know.  Well, you know, the spectrum of kind of straight to gay is this continuum. And through history,  men tended to be kind of gay before they got married. Really?  Yeah. And if you look at ancient Greece, and lots of parts of the world, even now, it's 
[01:42:30]  considered like a normal boys' activity that you have for them.  So it's not gay if you're single?  Yeah. I think the definition of gay and straight is all what you decide to call yourself.  Well, it's not gay if you don't push back.  I don't know. Whatever makes you feel like, oh, that's okay.  I don't know. Whatever you call yourself. But I mean, there are labels, I think, that  make some kind of sense, right?  Yeah, there are. I mean, people who are not interested in having sex with the opposite 
[01:43:00]  sex ever, they're on the far end of gay.  But most people are somewhere in the middle.  Somewhere in the middle.  So Freddie Krueger, Rob Halford.  You could go out with girls, but then on the other hand, you're equally as comfortable  maybe putting a java log in the fireplace and having a glass of wine with another man  in your pajamas.  Let's relax, perhaps. And that's absolutely acceptable.  Well, you know, I think if we didn't have social taboos around being gay, more people 
[01:43:30]  would be more fluid about it.  I agree.  Right, right.  I agree.  But do you think that's a bit faggoty, the scenario that Anthony just described?  Two men just hanging out, watching TV with a fire going in their pajamas, maybe.  Glass of wine.  Some cheese and crackers.  Cheese and crackers. That sounds like a nice kind of almost...  That's a date.  It's a date, right?  Yeah.  That's a real date.  That's what we were thinking.  That kind of sounds like a date.  Yep.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden the firemen show up. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, it's fantastic. It's fabulous.  And that's a porn film.  Fabulous.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we go on to the next question?  It's Bill in New Hampshire.  Bill, you have a question for the sexpert.  Oh, Shannon?  I sure do.  Hey, O&A.  Nice.  Hey, sugar nut.  Hi.  All right.  Bill, what do you have for Shannon?  Well, something I've been feeling really weird about for a long time.  When I was young, I used to kind of experiment with my friends. 
[01:44:30]  We'd hide under a porch and play silly games.  Is that normal?  What do you mean silly games?  Um, well, we'd get under the porch and, you know, we'd kind of gobble each other up a  little bit.  I'd rest my head on my friend's thigh and we'd just go from there.  What?  Do you have any weird name for this thing?  It sounds like a circle jerk with oral sex.  Oh. 
[01:45:00]  Well, we called it Monster Rain.  Monster Rain?  Monster Rain?  What kind of a sick idiot would come up with a name like that?  What is that?  Why Monster Rain?  What does the rain have to do with it?  Yeah.  Helen, what do you think of that?  Well, it was a good excuse to get under the porch.  We would pretend it was raining monsters.  Oh.  Oh, so the rain was coming.  You guys would hide under the porch and then kind of give each other oral favors?  Exactly.  Oh, okay.  So, you know, it's little kids blowing each other.  Yeah.  Where do you stand on that?  Helen, is that normal?  It seems like I think, yeah, it seems perfectly normal. 
[01:45:30]  I think Monster Rain is pretty creative.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Pretty creative.  I can feel a lot better about myself.  Yeah.  I mean, how old are you when that, like when you and Jimmy Robinson don't do that anymore,  Helen?  How old are you?  How old am I or how old was I?  No, no, no.  I'm asking the sex part.  How old is that when you're not normal anymore for doing that?  Well, I don't know if you're ever not normal for it.  I mean, because then you just become gay.  Well, the Bible says different.  Huh?  At some point, you just cross over into gay.  All right.  Right, right. 
[01:46:00]  Once you've hit puberty.  God willing.  You know, then you're just seeing guys instead of girls under the porch.  Yeah, yeah.  No, that.  Yeah, but that seems like a normal kid thing.  Yeah, Bill, don't worry about it.  Thank you for the question.  Yeah, that's.  Thanks, Bill.  I like that one, actually.  Let's go to New Mexico and talk to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Not a whole lot.  How's it going on, eh?  Good.  We're enjoying Shannon.  Shannon Muller?  Mullin.  Mullin.  Mullin.  I'm sorry.  You laughing there, sweetie pie.  Hello, marmalade bag.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:46:30]  Shannon, I got a question for you.  Great.  Shannon.  Yep.  Oh, something must have happened to his phone.  Uh-oh.  Did we lose New Mexico?  Yeah, okay.  Aw.  I don't know what that was.  Aw.  Sorry, Shannon.  Let's go to Lulin.  He had asked, like, Shannon, like it was going to be a good question or something.  Yeah.  We lost him.  It could have been a good one.  Now we're all going to be wondering what he was going to say, which is always uncomfortable.  Lul Jimmy is calling from New York. 
[01:47:00]  Yes, Lul Jimmy.  Hey, Opie Anthony.  Lul Connor.  How's it going?  I've been better.  I'm kind of wet behind the ears.  Oh, that's terrible.  Well, let's give you a little background information.  I'm a 35-year-old aspiring comedian, and I enjoy ladies of the night, occasionally.  Really?  You know, you're an aspiring comedian.  Can we see you anywhere?  Actually, you can see me at the downtown on December 23rd.  That would be what?  This Thursday night, huh?  That would be.  Okay.  All right.  Go to my website, eatabullet.com.  If you'd like to see my luscious body. 
[01:47:30]  Are you going to hopefully be funny?  Oh, I will kill.  I'm ready to go.  Or is it going to be the same old crap that you're known for?  Oh, why do you got to do this to me on radio?  All right.  I'm just joking.  We kind of know this guy.  He's a local comedian, and he's a meaty disaster.  Connor, you have something to add to Jimmy?  Yeah, if you want to go see little Jimmy, you can see him and actually Nathaniel, who's  headlining, at 516-293-7700.  That's the downtown Long Island.  A little plug for you, little Jimmy.  Thanks a lot.  Wow.  I'm going to come to you in, actually. 
[01:48:00]  All right.  Shannon, if you'd like to come, too, it's on me.  Cool.  Yeah, that sounds like fun.  Well, my problem here is that I enjoy my ladies of the night like usual, and I have a hard  habit of laying on my back and having them urinate on my throat.  Mm-hmm.  I need to get over this habit because I'm running out of money.  My mother's getting very distraught over this situation.  You told your mother about that?  My mother actually left a message on my answer.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Yeah.  Shannon, we do have that phone call.  Oh, no.  Please don't.  We do have that phone call, but... 
[01:48:30]  Shannon, we'd love to play this.  It's a message that little Jimmy's mother left little Jimmy on his phone.  Mm-hmm.  And it's about ladies of the evening and maybe what Jimmy could do to, I don't know,  stop seeing them so much.  How interesting.  Let's hear it.  Yeah, maybe you can add some insight.  Yeah, I mean, you're the sexpert.  I mean, you know, what does little Jimmy Norton's mom know about prostitutes, right?  Right.  Let's give a...  All right.  Hold on, little Jimmy.  Hi, sweetheart.  It's mom.  How are you?  Jimmy, I know this is a little awkward, but everyone's fine here, but we heard the radio show. 
[01:49:00]  We love it, by the way.  And you were talking about giving up, you know, ladies of the evening, which is a wonderful thing.  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always says replace something with something.  So I was thinking, you know, you have that nice gym downstairs, and, you know, just for  like 20 minutes to a half an hour, and you would feel better.  Use that.  And also, there's gyms in New York.  You could go. 
[01:49:30]  You could exercise, and you would feel a whole lot better.  You'd lose a little weight.  You'd tone up.  And you would leave, you know, tension and stuff, and you'd be meeting other people.  I don't know, honey.  I just thought it might be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm interfering.  I know.  I just, I'm thinking of you.  Nobody knows I'm calling.  So don't get offended or think I'm strange, but I am a mother, and I worry about you.  You're doing so well.  Everything is falling into place.  This might be just one of the, you know, the health thing.  It would help you, sweetheart. 
[01:50:00]  Well, anyway, that's it.  I'm not going to go on and on.  I know it's not my business.  But, anyway, I love you, and I feel I can interfere because I'm your mother.  I'm taking a special license.  But, anyway, we're looking forward to seeing you at Christmas, and I really hope you can make it.  And, anyway, don't be mad at me, okay, sweetie?  I love you.  Talk to you soon.  Bye-bye.  And there it is, little Jimmy's mom.  Isn't that sweet?  Isn't that sweet?  Little Jimmy, thank you.  Thank you for, you know, sending that in and sharing with everybody.  We greatly appreciate that.  But, Shannon, what we were thinking is that what was little Jimmy's mom saying because of the fact she was saying Dr. Phil says to replace things, 
[01:50:30]  and that he should go to the gym is that basically he's kind of fat-breasted and awful,  and that picking up prostitutes is probably the only option until he does a few crunches.  Well, she said that really nicely, if that's what she was saying.  Actually, I'd like to play right now a phone call that our own Connor's mother made to Connor.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:51:00]  Hi, Connor, it's Mom.  Next stop, Davey Jones locker.  Um, um, hello?  Is that it?  Yeah, I don't even know what that means.  Yeah. 
[01:51:30]  I didn't get that.  I didn't get it at all.  It's an old Cecilia message.  They got diapers.  I don't get that either, so.  Um, well, any advice to little Jimmy as far as the hooker habit and the mom calling and  all that?  He kind of sleeps with the guppies.  Well, exercise is always a good idea, but it's not exactly equivalent to a urination  set.  Right.  Exactly.  So probably that won't change what you feel like doing, but it's always good to get fit.  Okay.  Uh, does that help you, little Jimmy?  That really helps a lot, actually.  I don't feel so bad about myself. 
[01:52:00]  All right.  Very good.  Thank you for calling the program.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Bye, little Jimmy.  See you at the downtown.  Yeah, Thursday night.  We'll get to see him again.  That's going to be great.  It's going to be a great show.  Hey, Greg in Vegas.  We've got to wrap up with, um, uh...  Shannon.  Shannon.  Hey, I've got a question about pussy farts.  Do I cry?  Do I laugh?  Do I hang a car freshener over it?  What do I do?  What was the first part?  Uh, pussy farts, Shannon.  Where do you stand on that?  Pussy farts.  Well, there's air, you know.  But should girls feel silly, uncomfortable? 
[01:52:30]  Should they just say, ah, here it is.  It's the air moving around.  And if the guy wasn't there, it wouldn't be making noise, you know?  Right, right.  Good point.  It's really the guy's fault for moving around.  Ah.  So, no.  So, how...  So, your book now, how...  When did it actually come out?  It just came out at the end of November.  So, it's been out for two, three weeks.  Oh, two, three weeks.  Two or three weeks.  So, we must have one of the first copies.  We have one of the first copies, yeah.  Oh, thank you.  Connor's loving it.  I think they sent you, like, early. 
[01:53:00]  Why'd you only send one, though?  Uh, I don't know.  The publisher did.  I'm sure we can get you more.  Please do.  Oh, yeah.  I'm running out of pages.  Connor's going through it like crazy.  I'll get them to send you a couple more.  Thanks so much.  He loves it, yeah.  All right.  I don't know what this question is, so we'll...  We'll try to figure this out together on the air.  Zach from Tampa.  Zach?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, sweet fish.  Hi, Angel Face.  Like, two callers ago, I love the ladies of the evening, and I picked up one recently, 
[01:53:30]  and as I was rubbing my hands over her back, I noticed it was kind of wide, and then I found  some balls.  Does Shannon have any suggestions for me on this?  Wow.  Maybe you should talk to them a little bit more before you get them home.  Oh, good, good.  Good suggestion.  Yeah.  Well, should you feel ashamed that you picked up a man when you thought you were picking up  a female prostitute?  No, no, I wouldn't.  What's the best way, you say, to, like, wash man breath off of your junk, just in case, 
[01:54:00]  you know, something happened, and then you're getting this waft of man breath coming up.  Yeah, and your friend Tyler is knocking on the bathroom door going, how was it?  And you're, you know, you're in there washing shame off your mule.  Anaseptic soap.  Yeah, that's a little much.  All right.  All right, I guess so.  Well, we've learned a lot here today.  Shannon, thank you.  Thanks so much.  The name of the book is The Best Years of Your Life.  No, The Best You'll Ever Have.  Best You'll Ever Have, and you can get it in, oh, I can't see that page. 
[01:54:30]  Yes, Jimmy?  Yeah, where can you get it?  Connor?  Barnes & Noble, Amazon, any major bookstore.  Now, this is your first book?  This is my first.  Oh, wow.  Congratulations.  Thanks.  It's got to be very exciting.  It is exciting.  I hope people buy it and read it so I can write another one.  It's a real page turner.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, this was really good.  Thank you.  I really appreciate it.  Thanks very much.  I'm going to have a book party, so if you're in New York, you're welcome to come. 
[01:55:00]  Hold on one second.  What?  Another question?  Where's the book party, Shannon?  Yeah, where's the book party going to be held?  The book party's going to be at Lotus.  What happened?  Yeah, but she got it out.  I know.  You weren't able to hang up on her quick enough with these computer phones.  I thought she was going to give me an um or something.  Um, click.  I thought you let her get all the information out.  Oh, I blew it. 
[01:55:30]  No, you didn't, but she still didn't.  It's all right.  She got cut off.  She's standing there talking into the phone.  Oh, hold on.  Something happened to her phone.  What happened?  Shannon?  Yeah, I just connected.  Wait, what happened?  So, uh, wait, the book party's going to be, um...  Hello?  Shannon.  Jesus.  Is she going to call back?  If she does, silent game.  All right.  Silent game.  Let's see, uh, Bernie Getz is going to be on the show tomorrow?  Are you kidding me?  I've been begging.  How great is that?  I want Bernie Getz.  Bernie Getz will be on the program tomorrow. 
[01:56:00]  Well, he's, I think, he might be coming in or calling in.  We don't know.  Well...  All right.  Very good.  Coming in.  Great.  I love, I know.  Make sure Earl is here tomorrow.  All right.  Oh, Shannon.  I don't know what's going on.  Sorry about that.  So, your book party is coming.  Do you want to just, um, any final thoughts on the book?  Um, well, it's great for Christmas, so don't hesitate to get one at the holidays, but mainly  I'm interested in people telling stories, so if you, if you do pick up a copy of the  book, I hope you'll email me, and my email's in the book. 
[01:56:30]  Are you there?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello? 
[01:57:00]  Hello? 
[01:57:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello? 
[01:58:00]  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello? 
[01:58:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, Christ.  So, we're about to end the program.  Yep.  Okay.  We're about to play What Did We Learn On The Opie and Anthony Show.  What did you guys think of Shannon?  She was alright, huh?  Yeah.  Very good.  I thought she went on a little long, but it was alright. 
[01:59:00]  It was a good segment.  I thought she was very nice, but she got a little rude of you.  I think she was pissed off at us.  I don't know why she was unhappy with us.  Oh, no.  I think she thought that some of the callers were making fun of her or something.  No.  She didn't have to have an attitude about it.  No.  I've got to understand.  Some of our listeners are just stupid.  No.  She didn't really sound like an expert on sex.  Yeah, a lot of people are putting books out lately just to probably make a profit and 
[01:59:30]  rip people off.  Why did she hang up on us?  I didn't.  I don't understand.  You know, I think we treated her nice and she hung up on us like that.  Oh, no.  I didn't hang up.  I was going to plug the book again, but if she's angry at us, there's no reason for  her to be angry.  I don't know why she hung up on us.  We're not angry.  She sounded so nice at the beginning of the call and then at the end she hung up a couple  of times.  I was ready to call her a bitch or something.  I mean, I'm enjoying this book.  I didn't really want to go there, but I didn't know what to do.  All of a sudden we were left out there with an uncomfortableness that I've never been hung 
[02:00:00]  up like that.  No, no.  Three times the same.  She hung up three times, man.  It was like there's no reason for it.  No.  Sometimes I understand we have phone problems, but for the most part...  We had phone problems.  I don't know why she would do that.  And there was a couple...  Can you hear me?  She seemed nice at first.  Wow, the instant feedback are calling her the C word for some reason.  Why?  No, no, no.  For what?  I don't think she was that bad.  A little bitchy maybe, but I wouldn't use the C word.  She could probably sense how like... 
[02:00:30]  That was really rude to be talking and all of a sudden she's gone.  I know, just hanging up like that.  Wait, she's there?  Hello?  I'm here.  Shannon?  Hello?  Yes.  I'm here.  Crap complete.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Blah.  You make us feel better about ourselves.  That's right.  Like Tippi Tom.  You want to turn on the mic outside the studio so we can talk to Tippi Tom?  You're wonderful.  I think you're wonderful. 
[02:01:00]  Oh my God.  He's been drinking.  Is he crying?  Is he crying?  No.  Key.  Can we just light him on fire?  He's fading fast is what he's saying.  He's fading fast?  Hello again my friend.  He's singing.  It doesn't matter who you are.  Still I'll wait.  Yes I'll wait. 
[02:01:30]  Great.  Hello.  Hello.  I love you just the way you are.  Yes I do.  Yes I do.  Yes I do.  I love you any way you are.  Yes I do.  Come close to me.  I see song promo.  And be a part of me.  And I'll love you anyway.  Yes I will any day.  I will love you. 
[02:02:00]  He's singing about a subway drink.  He's singing about a subway drink.  Yes I will.  I will love you.  No you won't.  No you won't.  No you won't.  No you won't.  And you can kiss me if you want.  The microphone is melting.  Yes I will.  Yes I will.  Any day.  I will love you.  Any day.  I will love you.  Any day.  I will love you.  Any day.  I will love you.

And I will kiss you too.  This is great.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  Alright.  He just threw the mic down.  We are too big time.  Was that new U2?  Alright we got to bring him in here because he can't hear us.

Wait hold on.  Hold on.  Master Poe's putting a bag over the microphone.  Ben where's the Lysol?  I need it immediately.  I need it immediately.  Oh my god it stinks in here.

Why'd someone give him a Jaeger?  Give me a shot of Jaeger.  I'm scared.  I'm scared.  I'm scared.  I'm scared.  I'm scared.  I'm scared.  I'm scared, Tina.  I'm scared.  I'm scared.  I'm scared.

That's a urination.  He just took a rest stop.  Wooden on the skin.  Yeah.  I'll be about worn out.  All right, Tom.  You're back.  Oh, he's back.  Give me a beverage.  He'll stand farther away from me.  I'll be invading my...  I hate my space being invaded.  Oh, I know.  You got Keith in between you and Tibby, Tom.  I know, but he could be over there.  Go over there.  All right.  My name's Tibby, Tom.  He's not scared anymore.  You want some ass kick and rock and roll?  Yeah, let's get some...  ... 
[02:08:00]  Some rock and roll.  You like your Jägermeister?  You like that Jägermeister better than that cheap crap you've been drinking.  That's good stuff.  You like the Jäger?  Yeah, you like the Jäger.  All right.  It's not my tune.  It's somebody else I know.  All right.  It's like Listerine for the homeless.  Nasty!  For a white wedding!  Yeah!  Oh, a little Billy Idol.  Ah, fuck. 
[02:08:30]  All right, all right.  You got me.  All right.  I'll do one of my originals?  No, no.  Well, okay.  What's your Tibby Tom original?  It's an original.  Go ahead.  You're calling Tibby Tom.  All right.  I have a Harry Stern show and that motherfucking jackass in my book.  All right.  And I'm serious.  You're a jackass.  I tell a lie.  I have no thing to lie about.  Were you trying to get a radio? 
[02:09:00]  Uh, who?  Last week when you were down in Union Square?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Last week.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened?  Fuck, man.  Motherfucking thing.  I heard there were a lot of homeless people on that line.  Tibby Tom.  Go ahead.  Go all over.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Sing another song.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The lice is probably lying.  He's got to have lying.  The lice are just...  I got no lice!  ...trampolining out of his...  What are you talking about? 
[02:09:30]  I got no lice!  All right.  I thought maybe you might.  You're lying.  I got no lice.  I thought you might.  You got lice.  Why would he say that?  You lie.  Lie.  Why would he say that?  He said it.  He said it.  He said it.  I can't believe Anthony would say you had lice.  He said it?  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  I got no lice.  Why would he say that, Steve?  He doesn't have lice.  He's going with you.  Master Poe, how quickly can you strike?  Excuse my language?  But I'm telling you this.  I got no lice.  Yeah, he shouldn't say that.  I'm Tippy Tom. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, but you do have the age.  Yeah, I'm trying to sing a song.  He really does have the age, by the way.  Remember?  Aw, that's a shame.  Let me sing a song!  All right.  Sing a song, Tippy Tom.  He's a homeless gay guy, by the way.  You still gay, Tippy Tom?  Well, I was gay all my life.  All right.  No, I had no problem with that.  That's fine.  Is that what he's being gay?  No, he does.  No, no, he does.  He does.  He does.  Everyone's playing.  No one's playing to Steve.  I don't give a shit.  I don't give a shit.  Are you still getting action out there on the street? 
[02:10:30]  I'm a German.  I don't give a crap.  Tippy Tom.  Yeah.  You still getting action on the street?  Behind the dumpsters and stuff?  Yeah, I still go.  Yeah, yeah, I got action on the street.  Yeah.  When was the last time you got a little action on the street?  When Timmy Tom would go out on the street, I ain't gonna say these nasty words.  You can say whatever you want.  Yeah.  All right.  I got a blow job last night.  What do you think of that?  Wow.  Yeah.  Who gave you a blow job? 
[02:11:00]  I said, drag queen gave me a blow job.  And I'm thinking, hey, this feels good.  And I'm into it, man.  And I was groovy about it.  And now what I'm saying is this, the blow job was really good.  Frank Slade.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
[02:11:30]  I was happy.  Hey.  So what's wrong with being happy?  Well, you're happy, so why don't you sing a song you're so happy?  All right.  Let me belt one out.  All right.  Every time we'll belt one out.  All right.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Softly.  Softly.  I will leave you softly long before your arms can make me wait for one more hour. 
[02:12:00]  Come on.  Who did that?  Or one more day.  Who did what?  Who did what?  Is he complaining if someone farted?  After all the years.  He's perfect for Fry's voice.  Come on, guys.  Fuck me up, man.  That song was awful.  You don't even know who fucking sang it.  Yeah.  What song is it?  You don't even know.  You don't even know.  I know.  It was that guy who does those songs.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, right?  I'm right, though, right?  Yeah.  I can't bear the tears so softly as I leave you there, as I leave you there.  Who sang that?  Can you do some Frank Sinatra?  Yeah.  Oh.  All right. 
[02:13:00]  About time.  It is about time.  You need another shot before you do Frank Sinatra?  Yeah, it's fucking right.  It's about time.  It's about fucking right.  Get the hell out of here.  Where are you going?  Fucking right.  Yeah, go.  Get out of here.  Fucking right.  That's right.  Go.  Oh, my God.  There you go.  Give him a shot and point at the microphone.  Yeah, calm down.  There's your medicine.  There you go.  Jesus.  He's too wasted, dude.  He's too wasted before he walked in the door.  He got it.  Who got Frank Sinatra?  I want to hear some Frank Sinatra. 
[02:13:30]  Sing some Frank Sinatra, maybe.  Yeah, I can really sing like that guy.  Okay.  And do a little Frank.  Hey, Frank.  Pick up a note.  Frank's dead.  Frank smells just like you do.  Yeah, like I hang out with Frank Sinatra.  Right.  Yeah, right.  Kicking me in my ass.  Okay.  You want more Frank Sinatra?  Let's get some Frank Sinatra going.  You like Tony Bennett?  Ah, sing a little Tony Bennett. 
[02:14:00]  Whatever you want to sing.  Frank Sinatra.  All right.  Here we go.  Whoa.  He almost fell over.  Let me get Tony Bennett going here.  All right.  You might not want to move the mic around.  That's okay.  It's moving that way.  That's fine.  Willie Nelson?  Yes.  Willie Nelson.  I like Willie Nelson.  I do too.  Okay.  Oh my God.  Look at him staring at him.  All right.  We're bonding.  Sing a song.  Sing a song, Tippy.  Let's go.  Time. 
[02:14:30]  We're going to sing a song.  All right.  All right.  You ain't going to know this one.  It's going to be a little bit of a problem for all you guys.  You all grown up now.  I'm going back to when we were children.  I never thought that life could be anything but catastrophe. 
[02:15:00]  You get it.  Suddenly I just see a bit of good luck in me.  I met him.  You don't know it.  Fuck you guys.  You ain't shit.  Yeah.  That stunk.  It's one movie, man.  That was awful.  No, no, no.  Don't sit on that thing.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You can't sit here, Tippy.  This will break.  Yeah.  That'll break.  It has nothing to do with the smell.  All right. 
[02:15:30]  We just...  So you don't like...  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  So you don't like...  I want you to leave the studio for a little while.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm singing right now.  He's singing.  Oh, he's singing?  Yeah.  Now...  All right.  How big was the fellow that gave you...  She's a lady.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  She's a lady. 
[02:16:00]  Talk about my pretty lady.  And the lady is mine.  I like how he works the room, too.  Oh, don't fall down, dude.  Yeah, you know what she's about.  Hey!  Yeah, you guys, they got that music, man.  I ain't Tom Goon.  Yeah, fuck, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Get out of here.  Just get out of here.  Yeah, fuck, man. 
[02:16:30]  I was trying to get busy over here.  Tippi, you don't have to touch it anymore.  All right, why don't you take a break there, Tippi.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.  Come on, we got time.  We're gonna go get Joey.  No!  I'm singing right now.  A couple minutes, I gotta take a break.  We'll come back in.  Come on, I got another shot for you outside.  Motherfuckers.  Yeah.  Oh, he's ready to throw.  He's ready to throw.  Oh, he's ready to throw.  He's lifting his hands up.  All right, there he is.  Fuck out of here.  All right. 
[02:17:00]  I'm singing, man.  Come on, here.  Come outside.  Yeah, shit.  Shut my mouth.  He's back outside.  He's back outside.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That whole table there, he has to be washed down.  Did you see him, did you see him throw, like, put his hands up as Steve?  Like, you wanted to fight him and then he looked at Steve and that bit of sobriety came through  and he said, I'd get killed if I'd swung at him?  Motherfuckers.  Ugh.  I was singing.  I was trying to get busy.  Maybe he should have gotten busy years ago. 
[02:17:30]  That's my ass.  I don't think he wanted to hit Steve as much as he wanted to warm his hands up around Steve's  shirt.  Oh, maybe that's what it was.  He thought it was a flaming barrel.  He wanted to stand around and sing with four other guys.  Oh, God.  Everyone is now scrubbing down the studio.  Was that sprayed with what?  Lysol is being sprayed on the console.  Keith is washing his hands with that soapless or waterless soap. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, give me some of that stuff, please.  Yeah, those all have to, oh my God, it's his Jaeger cups.  I want to know who drank out of his mule last night.  Oh, God.  Well, we'll ask him in a minute.  We'll ask him in a while.  What kind of schlong, I mean, what's that schlong covered in?  Some kind of fish-tasting peanut butter.  We could take a look at it.  I'll bet when you...  I'll bet when you pull the foreskin back, it makes the same sound of fruit roll-up makes  when you peel it.  He actually bought a friend with him. 
[02:18:30]  He's downstairs.  I didn't...  Oh, really?  We didn't have Poe clear him yet.  A friend?  Another homeless guy is hanging out downstairs.  Does he smell as bad?  Is he coming up?  Yeah, I guess we could bring him up.  Does he have any more sensibility than...  Yeah, yeah.  He's in a little better shape than Tippy Tom.  He might be able to have a little insight on him.  All right, why don't you bring him up?  Years ago, Tippy Tom, we were just talking about this before, went into the hospital because  he...  I guess he broke something.  I don't remember the story, but he ended up in the hospital.  He ended up in the hospital where they, you know, took him off the sauce. 
[02:19:00]  Remember they shaved him?  Yeah.  They shaved his face and brushed his hair and everything.  And we had him on the air and he was completely normal.  He was completely normal.  Like any guy you'd see walking down the street.  Right.  Carrying on a regular conversation, saying, yeah, when I drink, you know, I get like this.  And then to see, like, what happens, it's just a mess.  Yeah.  Why aren't you guys micing him?  He turned it down.  Oh, don't turn him down. 
[02:19:30]  Dude, when he took his hat off...  I'm not a friend that gets sick.  Yeah.  When he took his hat off, it looked like somebody poured like a box of Uncle Ben's rice on his  head.  Oh, God.  I saw the lights just bounce again.  Oh, no, I'm all itchy.  I don't know, man.  I'm itchy now.  I don't need that.  I blew it, man.  All right, he's out there trying to calm down.  I want decontamination somehow.  I'm unhappy.  Because I fucked up.  It just stinks.  Listen to him.  He's just going off.  Timmy Tom, fuck up.  Timmy Tom, fuck up. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  I'll put on stage.  I'm just mesmerized by this guy.  I fucked up.  I blew it, man.  Say, Jim, nice meal.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  There's some sexual reference.  Are you guys ready to wake up, Tippi Tom?  Where's the broads?  Oh, boy.  Well, I don't know where the broads are.  Ben, what's going on?  Nothing works the right way.  I don't know where the broads are.  Nothing works the right way on this show.  Stuck in traffic.  I like how you tipped your fedora up when you said that.  Where are the broads?  I blew it, man.  I blew it, man.  I blew it, man.  Say, Jim, nice meal.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  There's some sexual reference.  Are you guys ready to wake up, Tippi Tom? 
[02:20:30]  Where's the broads?  Oh, boy.  Well, I don't know where the broads are.  Ben, what's going on?  Nothing works the right way on this show.  I'm stuck in traffic.  I like how you tipped your fedora up when you said that.  Where are the broads?  The broads.  I'm just going to sleep for a while.  All right, where's Keith?  Where's the holes with feet?  Keith!  Keith!  We have to make sure we do this right.  We got Tippi Tom outside the studio.  Wiggle those stems in here, dame.  No, Keith.  Come in here.  Hold on.  Keith!  Hold on!  Holy shit, these fucking guys that work for us. 
[02:21:00]  Sometimes they're just asleep.  Those silly geese.  Jesus.  What?  How are you going to wake him up?  We want to set this thing up here.  You got your gloves on?  Yeah, we'll give him a little stir and see...  Hopefully he hasn't pissed himself.  And you were telling us a little while ago that he gets really nasty when you wake him up.  Oh yeah, he's nasty when you wake him up.  He's real nasty.  Eric is covering his nose with his shirt.  Right.  I guess it really stinks out there.  All right.  We got Steve, who's filming all this for some videos that we'll get up on opieandempty.com 
[02:21:30]  later today.  All right.  It's waking up a belligerent homeless guy.  Keep that over there, the microphone.  You're supposed to be.  He's sitting on my side of the console.  Now make sure that mic is up.  Okay.  Make sure the mic works.  Test the mic.  Test the mic.  Oh my God.  And how are they going to hear us?  Test the mic.  The mic's on.  Okay, good.  How can they hear us?  No, but...  Do you have headphones on so you can hear us?  No.  No, of course not.  Why would they do that?  They're waking him up.  They're waking him.  Tommy. 
[02:22:00]  Tommy.  Uh oh.  He might be dead.  Tommy.  No, he's not dead.  He could be.  Is he blue?  Tommy.  He looks a little blue.  He's not moving.  Oh my God.  Is he blue?  He's taking his pulse.  Is he dead?  Oh my God.  No, I'm serious.  Oh my...  We could have a problem.  Uh oh.  Tippi Tom.  Oh my God.  Smack him in the head.  Alright.  His ears are... 
[02:22:30]  No, no, no, no.  Don't smack him.  His ears are kinda red.  No, he's...  I think he's alive.  They can't wake him though.  Wow.  He...  Is that...  Does he have a pulse?  Oh my God.  He's not waking up.  Anything you wanna...  No, don't...  Don't hit him.  Don't hit him.  Just smack him in the fire.  Would you like to try Master Poe?  He's dead.  Tommy.  He's taking his pulse.  Does he have a pulse?  Yeah, does he have a pulse?  Yeah, does he have a pulse?  He has a pulse. 
[02:23:00]  You guys really need headphones out there if we're gonna try to do a radio show.  Cause you don't know what we're saying.  Aw, I hope we didn't kill the homeless guy.  He's the only one we have.  Does he have a pulse?  I think...  Very, very faint pulse.  Oh my God.  Is he waking?  Steve's gotta move a little.  Steve.  How great would it be if he died on the radio show?  It wouldn't be great.  Oh God, what is he doing?  Master Poe.  Get a mic on Master Poe.  You know, he's gotta be a deep sleeper.  He's just...  He's passed out.  Yeah, he's gotta be a deep sleeper if he's a homeless guy.  You gotta sleep through a lot.  Master Poe, what do you think?  Master Poe. 
[02:23:30]  Get a mic on Master Poe.  You know, he's gotta be a deep sleeper.  He's just...  He's passed out.  Yeah, he's gotta be a deep sleeper if he's a homeless guy.  You gotta sleep through a lot.  Master Poe, what do you think?  Is he alive?  Uh, yeah, he's alive.  If I give him a couple of pressure points, he may wake up.  But I don't want him to...  I don't want him to go to the bathroom on the floor.  Yeah.  He is breathing out.  Hold the mirror up in front of his mouth.  Yeah, he's breathing. 
[02:24:00]  He's breathing, and he does have a pulse.  Oh, okay.  That's all you need.  If, um...  Alright, let's get the...  Oh, Steve's gonna, like...  Steve's touching the door.  What's he...  No, Steve's trying to snap...  Tippy Tom!  Oh my God, we can't...  We cannot wake Tippy Tom.  Give me cold water.  Really, really yell at him.  Not in his ear where it'll damage anything, but like, get right up to him and just yell,  Tom, wake up!  You know, just wake up.  There's another way to wake him up.  Tippy Tom!  Wake up, Tippy Tom!  Wake up, Tippy Tom!  Okay, that's not gonna work.  Wow.  Somebody yelled... 
[02:24:30]  Come on, Tippy!  Get up, boy!  Don't say...  Boy.  I like the red-headed lady out there who just can't believe this is happening in the studio.  Oh, I know.  She's disgusted.  Dude, he's not moving.  At all.  Alright.  Holy S.  How are we gonna get him out of here?  Just leave him here.  Let them deal with him later.  Put him in the Frank's Place studio.  Alright, what's going on out there?  Someone's gotta tell us what's going on out there.  They're pouring water over his ear a little bit? 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  A little water.  Steve, get out of the way!  There we go.  Turn your head.  I know you gotta film it, but I kinda wanna see.  Sorry.  Alright.  Keith, I need you.  What you gotta do is put your fingers in the water and then flick it onto his face.  That'll do it?  Oh, no.  Please tell me the homeless guy's not dead.  I think he's dead.  Oh, there he goes.  Okay.  That kinda...  Did that get him a little bit?  Did that get...  That's how you... 
[02:25:30]  Oh, he's stirring.  He's stirring.  What's Poe doing?  Poe is brilliant.  He's...  Yeah, we got some fun.  He's alive!  He's alive!  He's alive!  Thank God!  Oh, my God.  Knock you out.  You ready to do a little more singing?  Gotta wake up, Timmy.  You ready?  Oh, my...  I thought he was dead.  Dude, I'm not kidding you.  I thought he was dead, too.  Steve.  Just a little water in the ear.  Dude, did you all of a sudden have it going through your head, the news and everything?  Yes, of course.  All of a sudden, it was all going through my head.  Like, oh, my God. 
[02:26:00]  The news.  We're fired.  Wow!  Wake up!  Alright, he's starting to wake up.  You have to wake up.  Water on the eardrop.  Well, get up now!  You know why some people want to hear you say...  Water on the eardrop?  We're doing Frank Sinatra together.  I need my 15-minute rest.  15 minutes?  It's my business, not yours.  Not yours.  No, no, I know Tippi, but we need you inside.  I don't bother you when you're resting.  It doesn't bother me.  Oh, my God.  Thank God he's alive.  Thank.  Come on, Tippi. 
[02:26:30]  I can't believe we have to say this on our radio show.  Get the fuck out there and work and come back.  Back me up in 20 minutes.  Yeah, Tippi Tom, drink this.  No.  Oh, God.  He's saying no to a drink.  Wow.  He doesn't even want to drink.  No, I want rest now.  Be my friend and give him my 15-20 minutes.  All right.  We'll give him 15 or 20 minutes.  No?  Yes.  We should go make him sleep by that lady's desk, though.  Oh, God.  No. 
[02:27:00]  Right on the floor by her feet.  Tippi.  Stinking up the place.  Yo, Tippi.  Come on, Tippi.  We have to wake up.  Not now.  I said 20 or 15 minutes.  I'm going to tell you about my boss.  He's going to be coming in about 15 minutes.  Just get the fuck out of here.  Give him 15 minutes.  I don't sleep 15 more minutes if he wants.  I don't...  I don't...  Give him my 20 minutes.  Now that we know how to wake him up...  Wake him up.  Yeah.  He is seconds away from getting really nasty.  No, I have to sleep for two hours.  Yeah, no.  You were sleeping for two hours.  We need you inside, Tippi.  Go out.  Get out of here before I fucking... 
[02:27:30]  I told ya.  Go mad!  I told ya.  I told ya.  I'll bust somebody's head off his...  Motherfucker!  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  Give me time.  What's up, pal?  I know you.  Get the fuck out of here.  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  You've always said a long time with good friends.  Fuck you.  Give me my...  Get up.  Rest.  Man.  You want coffee?  No.  I'll leave.  That's why I'll happen.  And you want to see me. 
[02:28:00]  Give me my 15, 20 minutes and get the fuck out of here.  Hey.  Come on, pal.  We're gonna go inside.  We're gonna sing it.  No!  I don't want to wake up now.  You're fucking with me.  Go get lost.  There's this guy here.  He wants to suck your cock.  I ask him.  I don't care.  Nice blow job.  Get you going good in the morning.  Come on, pal.  Leave me 15, 20 minutes, please.  He's right, man. 
[02:28:30]  Fuck you, man.  Oh, jeez.  They took his head off.  I'm on 15th fucking mint, you son of a bitch.  You scumbagged motherfuckers.  He's walking around now.  He's fucking suck my dick.  Fuck.  Eat my asshole shit.  He's walking out.  Get the fuck out of here.  Look at the face on her out there.  Look at that mug.  Run away, Timmy.  Do we want to keep him or do we want to let him go?  Keep him.  Tell Steve to film her.  Holy shit.  He's just wandering around the office and horrifying everyone else that works here. 
[02:29:00]  You should see the mug on her.  Oh, I know.  Very angry.  She's not happy.  That's right.  Eat my asshole, he said.  Jesus.  It's quite a meal, you know.  I'm telling you.  A thick, viscous meal.  We tell the truth on this show as much as we possibly can.  I swear, my heart sank.  I really thought he was dead.  I thought he was dead, too. 
[02:29:30]  Because they were raising his arms and his head and there was no...  He was not moving.  There was nothing.  And he kind of had a...  It was just falling.  Purple hue to him.  What's up, Ben?  Eric's on the phone with...  They're talking to us at 12 there.  Oh, okay.  Is he near the elevator?  No, he's by the main door.  Alright, Eric, what's going on?  We ran out of microphone cord but he's heading back so we're going to throw him back on the mic.  Alright.  Oh, here he is.  Keep away from my side.  Alright, he's alive.  And he's awake.  He's coming in the studio.  He's got his fists up.  Hey, come on in here, Tippy.  What's bad ass kicking you want? 
[02:30:00]  What's up?  Tippy, what's going on out there?  Wake me up.  I'm trying to get a little nap.  We need you inside, Tippy.  But you're here to perform, no?  I bust his ass.  I thought you wanted to sing another song.  You want to fight?  Yeah, I'll fight you.  We're going to fight.  I hope he's getting up.  I'm not fighting him.  What's the bro dope you want?  You want a bruised nose?  One of those gritty knuckles in your face?  Not even.  He'll just lick your mouth and nose.  End of fight. 
[02:30:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  Alright, Tippy Tom, let's work this out.  What happened?  You're going to get your ass beat.  Alright.  What happened?  What happened out there?  Here's what's happening that's going on there.  I have no idea what happened to you.  What's going on?  You're a deep sleeper, by the way.  I was trying to get a little nap.  Okay.  Because, you know, I'm a little sleepy.  A little tired.  A little sleepy.  A little tired from all the work that you do.  A little sleepy, you know what I'm saying?  And so I try to take a little nap.  Yeah.  And these motherfuckers over here give me a hard time.  Right.  So, what I got to do, I don't, it's not I don't love them, but what I'm saying is that 
[02:31:00]  I want to take my nap.  But you were napping for about two hours.  No.  Yeah, you were.  We watched you sleeping.  You were lying.  It was two hours.  It wasn't two hours.  It was two hours.  You're lying.  It wasn't two hours.  I don't lie.  I had a nap for about half an hour.  It was two hours, Tippy Tom.  Well, Tippy Tom is unhappy. 
[02:31:30]  And something I'm saying is this.  Is that I'm going to bust somebody's nose.  Alright, bust his nose.  That guy is the problem right there.  I'm trying to get another half hour in.  Yeah.  Can we get a song before you go back to sleep?  Can we get another song before you go back to sleep?  A little lullaby, maybe.  Sing me a lullaby, please.  If I do one, I would.  Yes, you do.  Come on.  The one you always sing. 
[02:32:00]  Which one?  You always sing your lullaby?  Yeah.  Sing the lullaby.  Alright.  Radio station, right?  Yeah.  Right on.  Alright.  Here we go.  Fairytales can come true.  They can happen to you.  Obviously.  If you're young at heart.  Now let me take a nap. 
[02:32:30]  That's all you get.  That's all we get.  Hey, we want to hear about the drag queen from last night.  It's hard to find the matter of the mind if you're young at heart.  But if you should survive.  To 102 or 3?  Something like that.  Yeah.  If you are amongst the young at heart, give me the right answer to that.  Alright.  Now I can't do it like him.

[02:39:30]  All right, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Jerry.  I have a question for Master Paul.  What did you do to drop me?  You kids, outside the studio, no one can wake him up, and you just dripped a little bit  of water on his ear, and he was up.  Yeah.  Water was nice and cold, and it went down his ear and just woke him up.  Just like that.  All the slapping and hitting him with the microphone did nothing but a drop of water in his ear.  One drop of water.  One drop of cold water right in his ear canal, right?  Exactly.  Oh.  Went down his eardrum. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  That'll wake you up.  All right.  I think my brother's onto something here.  He just handed me a note.  Have a homeless American Idol contest.  Ooh.  Geez.  Imagine getting...

It's a great idea.  Ziggy's dead, baby.  Ziggy's dead.  We could give this to...  Keith, you want to run with this?  Ziggy.  Yeah.  Keith could be the Simon Cow of this bit.  I think I could think of a couple other...

You don't know what to make of it.  It's fantastic.  But it all falls under the subheading of yummy.  You guys want to hear anything going into break?  Uh...  No.  Nothing I could think of.  Nothing pops in your head?  Yeah.  Whatever you want, Ope.  Uh...  Nothing aside from that foul stench is popping in my head.

They called me Jimmy Tom, but I'm Golden Bucks.  All right, Golden Bucks, sit down.  The sad part is he'd have a better shot with Jimmy than I would.  That was horrible.  Where are you, Anthony? 
[03:05:30]  I have gone as far away from this situation as I can get.  Anthony's gone underground.  Golden buns is leaving.  Where are you going?  Golden buns?  Right on the corner.  Golden buns?  No, hang out.  The girls are going to do stuff.  Hang out.  I got to get some fresh air because I show my golden buns.  You're not the one I need some fresh air after that.  You're used to that stuff.  We're not.  We're not.  We're going to get Timmy's ass out of here to show his golden buns over there for a moment.  All right. 
[03:06:00]  I can't show my golden buns over here.  All right.  Well, why don't you go?  You might as well hang out because you can't see through the glass now.  You can just sit in the corner.  No.  All right.  You can get topless.  No.  I got to buy a beer.  All right.  What are we doing?  All right.  Where's Steve?  This is his train wreck.  Are you sure I know that?  Holy Jesus.

Golden buns.  Eat your chocolate bar there, golden buns.  Well, anyway.  Oh, yeah.  Back to the hot girls.  This proves how twisted we are on the show.  We'd rather see that mess than these beautiful women.  We're stupid.  Speak for yourself. 
[03:07:30]  We're stupid.  All right.  So what do we got going on today?  Well, which would you guys prefer?  Or do you want to see some of Diana's contortionist moves first?

Wood floor, yeah.  I could see through the underwear.  I couldn't.  It was great.  Can we do a move without the underwear?

I was over in this corner, and I was catching a waft of what was going on.  It was hilarious.  It had to be the worst smell ever.  I was all right.  You're used to the smell.  Yeah.  After all of that.  You got your $2 worth today.  Wait a minute.  After all of that that I just did, I want to hear a song.  Come on now.  That was worth a song.

All right, Tippi Tom, you only have your underwear on.  Nice.  I'll give you her number.  I'll give you her number before we get out of here, okay?  Oh, my God.  This is atrocious.  Look at what.  I'm still packing flies. 
[03:14:00]  What?  No, I'll give you her number before we leave.  Do you have a phone?  All right.  You're kicking me out.  I'm taking a caller.  Now I'm not kicking you out.  All right, Tippi Tom.  You are more than welcome to stay here as long as I am.  Anyone else want to get naked?  What would you like to see them do?  Sure.  I want to hear some music, man.  I want to get busy.  That's what I'm saying.  All right, why don't you sing a song?  Tippi Tom, why don't you sing a song?  I'm talking about let's get busy.  All right, go ahead.  Let's get naked, man.  And everybody, start fucking.  I was born in the Roman Empire.

Yes.  All right, sing some.  You know anything about Caligula?  Yes.  I know a lot about that.  Okay.  I read so many books, I don't know how many I read.  In jail?  Am I gay?  Well, yeah.  It's possible. 
[03:15:00]  Close.  It's possible I'm gay.  He's bisexual.  I think I'm gay.  Well, you're bisexual, right?  Would you have sex with her?  If she lets you, would you have sex with her?  Or would you have sex with young Eric?  This kid's cute, isn't he?  I never.  He cheated on me.  I don't know.  All right.  I don't believe he did.  Sing a song there, Tippi.  I think he a cheating, motherfucker.  Cheat on Tippi Tom. 
[03:15:30]  What you did?  All right, sing a song.  I thought we were going to get together.  What the hell is he going off about?  Yeah, you ran over somebody else.  All right, anyway, what I was saying is this.  Is that Tippi Tom is very unhappy.  Yeah.  Because I ain't got no whipped cream.  There you go, honey.  All right.  Oh, God.  We're done with that.  We're done with that.  I guess we'll be throwing out the whipped cream that we're going to use on the girls.  I want to know how much Danny would charge to lick whipped cream off Tom's nipple. 
[03:16:00]  All right.  Danny, how much?  I got 20.  I'll do that for free.  Stop it.  All right, wait, wait, wait, wait.  All right, Tom, what are we doing?  You have taken over the show.  What do you want to do?  All right, all right, hold on now.  Now, you know, I write stuff.  I do direct.  Whenever I write, I feel like writing.  Scarf around his back.  When I don't write, I don't feel like writing.  That's all it is.  You look like a superhero.  Well, I'm not better than anybody.  But why don't you have my pants are down. 
[03:16:30]  I am not touching you.  You might as well take your underwear off.  You're still wearing underwear.  No.  Nobody gets to see my feet.  You had a big bag.  Yeah, why don't you take your underwear down because nobody gets to see my feet.  I'm very embarrassed about my feet.  It's all your balls.  Why, are they clean?  Embarrassed about his feet?  My feet are ugly.  They're small. 
[03:17:00]  All right.  But this is big.  Oh, yeah.  That a boy, Tom.  Why don't you show the ladies what you're packing there, Tom?  Show me a hog.  Who cares?  Yeah, we're all just...  All right, show you my ass.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  This is golden buns.  Golden buns.  Golden buns.  You mess around with golden buns, man.  You know who you're dealing with, man. 
[03:17:30]  Golden buns.  I think those are more bronze.  Oh, my God.  I gave you a freebie.  We got the freebie.  Thank you, Tibby, Tom.  I think I need to breathe.  All right.  Well, let's get back to the ladies here.  Thank you.  So what are we going to do now?  I think you've been looking at me.  And thank you for making us that thing.  That was very nice.  You're very welcome.  I think Annabelle might be cajoled into giving Jimmy a lap dance if he asks nicely. 
[03:18:00]  Okay.  Cajoled?  And he will.  I'd love a lap dance.  I haven't gotten one ever.  Yeah, right.  Since the NW days.  Do you need the baby breath for that?  What was the, what about the food products?  What were we going to do?  We had some pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving.  Did you want to do something on the console with that?  Because I think we're ready for the grand finale.  And if you guys do a good job, we'll play a song from Point Blank, I think.  Right, Ann?  Yeah, there you go.  Thank you.  Oh, I can't get over this. 
[03:18:30]  This is like...  Oh, my God.  All right, we're filming all this for the website.  No, my time too.  Are you dining or am I dining?  We got the pumpkin pie out and the brunette and the blonde.  What?  She's taking over the stage.  She's taking over the stage.  Does that make you unhappy there, Tippi Tom?  More nudity.  More nudity that isn't Tippi Tom.  And Tippi Tom's really hungry.  Tippi Tom pissed off.  Tippi Tom pissed on himself. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  He looks really underwear.  He's looking at that pumpkin pie going, don't waste that.  I'm hungry.  They don't like Tippi Tom.  They got Tippi Tom spray.  They like Tippi Tom.  They like Tippi Tom.  It's all calm down.  Everyone likes you.  What are all those scabs from, Tom?  I think they don't like Tippi Tom.  It's called Hiv, Opie.  Tippi Tom.  My turn.  All right, the brunette needs attention.  Yeah, take that off.  I can't believe my mama. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, there we go.  Very nice.  I'll get that skirt on.  Down to just a thong.  I might be kidding.  The point blank thong.  You're rubbing yourself like an animal.  Very nice.  Yeah, yeah, director.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, yeah, Tom, put your clothes back on.  Jesus.  Please.  And the blonde is now topless as well.  Very nice.  Bravo.  Are those real?  Yeah, they are, right?  I'll say they are.  Fantagous.  There we go. 
[03:20:00]  Looks like 36D.  I love these girls, remember?  No?  34D.  Very nice.  Okay.  I was trying to explain to them how you guess ages, Opie.  I do guess ages.  They didn't want to do it that way.  That's all right.  Do you know my age?  Guess Tippi Tom's age, Opie.  No, I don't.  I do a whole thing.  But you guys do the pumpkin pie thing.  Huh?  It's like a whole thing.  A whole thing.  Just about.  You got that right.  All right, so here we go. 
[03:20:30]  All right, we got the hot blonde and the hot brunette on the counter, Anthony, in front  of us, both topless in their point-blank thongs.  The little gymnast is laying down now on her back.  She's got a whipped cream put on her nippies.  Nice.  Could Tippi Tom lick that off?  It's only a ton.  Why not?  Tippi Tom, you want some whipped cream?  They don't like Tippi Tom.  They love Tippi Tom.  I don't know if I'd go with that one.  I like whipped cream. 
[03:21:00]  Would you go for that whipped cream?  What do you think?  You want to lick some whipped cream?  No, I'll get my clothes on.  Well, that's okay.  You don't have to do it naked.  I'll get my clothes on.  Yeah, you really needed to put your clothes on.  What do I want to do?  Fight this guy?  No.  All right.  Tippi, come here.  I don't feel a fight no more.  Come here.  She wants to dump her.  Don't touch me.  I'll lick you.  Let him lick you.  Just for this to be a silly goose.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Don't.  Take it all.  Take it all.  Take it all.  Put it in your mouth. 
[03:21:30]  Put it in your mouth.  Oh.  It fell all over the console.  I fucked up.  All right.  He's fucked up.  I've got to get us out of here.  I am disgusted.  And we've got the hot girl with the whipped cream in front of us.  I'm sorry.  On our nips and down her belly.  We need a whistle.  All right.  The blonde is licking the whipped cream off the boobies.  Tom just almost shoved his face in the girl's back.  Strap one out. 
[03:22:00]  No one's looking.  Yeah, Tom, if you have to, do what comes naturally.  We don't care.  No problem.  I'm a queer.  So what?  You know that, what's wrong with being a queer, right?  Nothing in God's ass.  You're a queer, but you're digging this, right?  But I like our ass.  You like our ass?  Wow.  All right.  No.  No.  The one girl's licking whipped cream off the nipples of the other girl.  He won't bother your ass.  Dude, that ass is on that couch.  So what?  Let him say that.  We don't say that.  Oh, yeah.  Up, up, up.

They're just rubbing the whipped cream all over each other.  I feel like jacking off.  I feel like jacking off. 
[03:23:00]  I'm going to jerk off.  That's what I'm going to do.  You should, Tom.  Show him who's boss.  Yeah, go ahead, Tom.  We don't care.  Maybe Tom's going to jerk off.  Very nice.  That would work better than a loaded gun if you wave that thing at people.  Get on that, bro.  Very nice.  Very nice.  And there's the...  I'm going to jerk off right now.  All right, go ahead, Tom.  If you have to, you might as well.  You got to scrap.  Go ahead.  No one's looking.  Are you too insane?  Let him scrap.  He's been doing everything you say. 
[03:23:30]  Just don't.  Someone wants us to describe the girls.  We got a very hot blonde with very big boobs.  Very natural.  And a very hot brunette.  A little more petite.  Steve C. is taking some videos.  Of course.  Yeah, you can catch it all online.  Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom going to jerk off.  All right.  All right, you might as well.  Yeah, you're all talking no action.  You're all talking no action, pal.  That's right.  I want approval.  Oh, you got...  We gave you the approval.  We gave you...  You can't have the ball to jerk off. 
[03:24:00]  Yes, you didn't have the ball to do it.  There's no way we're going to have a homeless guy jerking off in front of two real hot lesbians.  That's what we really want.  I can jerk off.  You can't jerk off.  I bet you can't.  I dare you to jerk off.  You said I'm a lesbian.  Well, for the bit, you're lesbians.  It makes it easy.  This is the best of humanity and the worst of humanity.  All in the same room.  Tom, you have no balls.  You have no balls.  Give me Tom to jerk off.  No, I bet you won't.  I got $20 says you don't. 
[03:24:30]  I got balls.  I got $20 says you don't.  You bet me $20.  I'll bet you $20.  Here, I'll even give it to Keith.  You won't jerk off for $20.  Give me a few minutes.  Ah, see, all talk, no action.  We've got five minutes left.  Five, we've got two minutes left in the show.  Yeah, because he needs pumpkin pie.  Give it to Tom.  Yeah, Tom.  Tom, you ain't jerking off.  I'm jerking off.  You're not jerking off.  Tom has plenty of pumpkin pie in the back of his underwear. 
[03:25:00]  Eric, show him your ass so he can get it up.  You know damn well, Timmy Tom can jerk off.  Oh, yeah?  I don't think you can.  I got $20 says you don't.  Yeah?  Yeah, why don't you give it a shot?  You lying motherfucker.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know damn well I can jerk off.  See, you're not jerking off.  All right.  That thing might go off.  You want me to jerk off?  I want you to jerk off.  As you get ready to do that, I'm going to play a little bit of Point Blank here.  20 bucks and a bottle of Jager.

Pull him 20 bucks right now.  Oh, no, no, no.  I'm locking you up.  All right.  Let's pass him down.  Oh, my God.  He's going to kill him.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I thought I could jerk off here.  No.  Just stop.  Oh, my God.  You said I could jerk off here.  You're jerking off.  I said I'd jerk off over here and Jimmy Norton did a lap dance in the corner. 
[03:27:00]  You said I could jerk off here.  You are jerking off.  Relax.  You said I could jerk off over here.  Get him out of here.  Fuck, man.  You ain't got no jerk off things.  You decided to do it right on the table.  How much time left in this awful show?  Oh, my God.  No, stop.  Make him stop. 
[03:27:30]  And Jimmy's getting a lap dance in the corner.  I thought I could jerk off on stage.  I want to thank Point Blank for coming in today.  Thank you, guys.  In the background, it's You Don't Stand a Chance from their CD, Cast the First Stone.  You ladies were awesome.  See you guys at the downtown tomorrow.  Yeah.  Anthony and I will be at the downtown tomorrow in Farming Day.  I didn't get off.  You jerked off.  You could have my $20.  You did.  Trust me.  We didn't want to see much more than that anyway.  All right.  Get off our lesbian couch, though, please.  Oh, come on. 
[03:28:00]  Come on.  You know something?  Yeah.  He just had his hands on himself.  And now if he touches anything, I need this whole place disinfected now.  You said I could jerk off on the fucking stage.  Ten seconds.  And I can't.  Now I'm pissed all the years.  You're pissed off.  Take my $20 and the Jägermeister.  Jägermeister, we are out of here.  What a mess.  F-ing mess.  How do you propose we get an entire nation to sit through a massive picture?  The OPNM Show.

[03:29:00]  Here's Opie and Anthony when they're not awful.  Okay, terrific.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  No more of that.  It's bad for you.  Got an email here.  Hey, guys, just got in from the anysoldier.usbenefit show at the Stress Factory tonight starring little Jimmy Norton and Rich Voss.  Norton killed as usual, but that's besides the point.  F-ing Voss.  He's so whipped he took a call from Bonnie in the middle of his act.  It went something like this.  During his act, he checked his phone once, and as a cover he had to make a little hacky cell phone joke. 
[03:29:30]  So he says, fucking sprint.  They call it that because you have to run to find service.  Waka waka.  Ah, there you go.  A little while later, someone yelled out, how's Bonnie?  She's okay.  She'll be here later.  Wait, who said that?  Why am I answering you?  Who's Bonnie?  Near the end of his set, he couldn't grab the phone hanging from his pocket and get it to his ear fast enough.  Where are you?  You're in New Brunswick?  No, I'm not bombing.  You're at the train station?  Turns to the crowd and says, how far is the train station from here?  Yeah. 
[03:30:00]  So then the people in the front row were all trying to give him directions for Bonnie.  It was a giant clusterfuck, as people were naming the wrong streets and turns, and Bonnie would have ended up a statistic in the paper.  So some dude from the crowd had to get up, go to the train station, and escort her to the club.  Are you kidding me?  How effing whipped do you have to be to take a call in the middle of your set from your chick?  Anyway, just wanted to share that with you guys.  Aside from that dignity-destroying moment, he had a great set as well.  Maybe you could get him on the phone today and see how he defends himself. 
[03:30:30]  This is from Lauren.  Did you see this last night?  No, I decided I wanted to be responsible and come home and sleep.  Ooh, so you did your set and left.  Had my car jump-started for the second time that night because the battery is dead, and then I drove home and backed in.  And the stupid PR who works at my thing doesn't understand English.  So I'm like, look, just leave it running until you back it in.  Oh, no.  He's like, leave it running.  So I had to stand in the garage while this little failure backs my car in, and then I went upstairs and tossed and turned and dreamed of Black Sabbath at my birthday party. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  Like a faggot.  That's cute.  Were you wearing a little party hat?  That was awful.  Happy birthday, Jim.  Where's the band?  They left.  Maybe I can dream next time that's my birthday and I'm kneeling in a bathroom and you put your swamp ass in my face.  All right, well, we got Rich Vassa on the phone.  Rich.  What's going on?  Hey, Rich.  What happened last night, buddy?  First of all, Norton goes on.  He kills.  Right.  He just destroys.  And he does it all the time.  He's such a weasel.  Yeah.  Whenever, oh, I got to go on in the middle because I got to get back home, you know. 
[03:31:30]  Never.  The extra half an hour is going to kill him, you know.  I always close those shows.  He takes a prime.  I mean, he kills.  He's funny.  He's got a lot of funny stuff.  Don't talk about me like I'm not here, stupid.  I'm right here.  All right.  And the only thing worse than your cell count is your battery.  So, okay, 0 for 1.  Well, but I don't always go on in the middle.  I just, I actually, I had a legitimate reason last night.  We did a fundraiser at the Stress Factory a couple months ago for Levy, Bob Levy. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, you know what?  And I went on.  Shut up and shut up and listen.  One of our B comic friends, his wife is leaving him because he brings girls on stage and eats  whipped cream out of their answers.  Wait, who does that?  Bob Levy.  Bob Levy.  Oh, my God.  He brings girls on stage and eats whipped cream.  Blue cheese.  Oh, blue cheese.  He's divorcing him and he can't imagine why.  Oh, that's going to be fun in court when that comes up.  I know.  No pictures, right?  So, we do a fundraiser and Levy goes on and he kills, but he's filthy.  And Norris is like, I don't want to go on after him.  Can you follow him? 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  And I'll go, okay.  You know, he's too dirty.  And Norris...  I didn't say he was too dirty.  No, I didn't.  What would you say?  I never could follow Levy historically in my career.  He's the one guy I was always...  Yeah.  Never wanted to go on after him.  Well, you know what?  To get over your fears, you have to do things like that.  Well, sorry, I can't host every show like you do.  I'll host.  Oh, you fucking Bob Eubanks.  Every show you do, you want to host.  You're right.  I don't want to host because I know how to call your show, stupid.  So, last time he goes on and he destroys.  It's this really funny fluid comedy. 
[03:33:00]  A lot of stuff about his fluids and different diseases.  Sure.  Destroys, right?  So, I go on after him.  Jerk.  Right?  And, you know, I do an hour.  No problem.  You know, you can follow him.  You can follow that kind of humor.  You just do stuff with punchlines and stuff, right?  Yeah.  So, well, where are you from?  Yeah, I didn't.  I didn't work around.  Stuff with punchlines.  What are you drinking?  So, during this show.  Well, Rich, I'm not to interrupt you, but I'm sorry I had to get out of there. 
[03:33:30]  But I was running late.  My cell phone wasn't working, so I had to sprint for service.  Or did you have to check your RSVP list to see if Black Sabbath is coming to the party?  That's a true story.  I had a little dream.  Yeah, you had a little dream.  Black Sabbath must have been really upset that they were all wet on in the face.  I can see upset little Jimmy in his dream that Black Sabbath wasn't at his party.  They were at the party.  MTV threw me a party.  Yeah.  And there was a special treat.  And then Sabbath left.  Did you tell me how to leave the party early because you had to get up for work? 
[03:34:00]  Sorry.  Anyhow, so...  I don't like the fact that you almost named somebody in Sabbath and realized you couldn't.  I forgot the guy's name.  Sorry, guitar player.  I can't believe you grabbed that one.  Wow.  So I'm on stage, you know, and I get a phone call.  Now, my girlfriend is coming from New York on a train, which she's never done.  Okay, she's from Canada.  And she was coming from New York from her Letterman audition when she got the show. 
[03:34:30]  And, you know, I never took the train from New York to New Brunswick either.  So, you know, I get a call on stage and I kind of thought it might be her.  You know, New Brunswick is in a place you want some little white girl walking around.  And she got off, you know, off the train and I said, where are you?  You know, I was wondering.  I was already at 50-something. 
[03:35:00]  This was during your act, though.  I don't really have an act.  Thank God he's finally admitting it.  Okay.  You know, this is way before, you know, I was going to say, you know, you can get my new DVD to the audience.  You got a new DVD at richfoss.com?  Yeah, it's just, yeah, and I get the first people I thank on the DVD.  It's my good friends, Opie and Anthony, who, you know, I don't call in the morning just to thrash them and trash them because their girl calls them.  So she called and, you know, I try to get her directions and people got up from, you know, the audience and started walking out to go find her. 
[03:35:30]  Not to help me because she's hot, you know, but maybe they have a shot in three blocks.  So, you know, one guy goes out and she tells me some guy comes up and goes, I'm a cop.  You know, he shows his badge and, you know, and they walk her over to the, and the sprint joke is not a hacky joke.  That's a funny joke.  I didn't say it was hacky.  I don't know.  Whoever called in or wrote in, you know. 
[03:36:00]  But now we're getting a lot of people that are saying you're kind of pussy whipped now with Bonnie.  Well.  Do you blame him?  Jesus.  Well, but what's the, you know, what do you mean?  You know, finally a guy, you know, a guy is happy with, you know, this time with a girl.  And, you know, you know, it's not like I, you know, yeah, I don't know if that's what you'll call it.  I'm, you know, I'm a good boyfriend.  You're not a, you're not a good, you're not a good boyfriend or a good friend.  You're not a good anything.  You're a creep. 
[03:36:30]  Although, I'm kind of caught in the middle.  As one of Voss's best friends, I'm kind of caught in the middle between being, because she is really hot and they get along great.  And look, they're a good couple.  But I'm caught in between being happy for him and wanting to smash his face.  Yeah.  When we're going to Albany, the phone keeps ringing because they're in love.  It keeps ringing and he keeps answering it.  I'm like, could you be a fucking guy for once?  He would just answer the call every time.  I'm in the middle of telling a great Hummer story and how the guy reacted when I gave it.  As we're driving to Albany, he goes, can you be a guy and pull into this rest area? 
[03:37:00]  Here's the thing.  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  Hi, poofy.  Yes, Snookums.  No, just driving with Jimmy.  Okay.  No, I love you too.  Oh, hold on, Jim.  Hold on.  We're at mile marker five.  Hi, Snookums.  But, Rich, the problem is...  Wubby, wubby, wubby, you too. 
[03:37:30]  I just realized that my relative is really, really sick.  Hold that thought, Jim.  Hold that thought.  Good improv skills.  I say my relative.  Could I have picked one?  My relative.  Well, really concerned.  One of my ancestors.  He stinks.  My kin is ill. 
[03:38:00]  National comes.  Wow.  Richie, wubby, wubby, wubby, wubby, wubby, wubby, wubby, wubby, wubby.  Hey, Jim, remember the time I was getting a blowjob and you were dogging that chick in the...  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  No, lover.  You're the only one in my life.  My forever girl.  Oh, you're my forever girl. 
[03:38:30]  You complete me.  Oh, Jim, you're getting pulled over.  This is a good opportunity for me to take this call.  I understand why you do it, Jim.  Why you do it, Voss.  Here's the thing.  She's a very attractive, very nice girl,  and I don't even understand for a second why she's with you. 
[03:39:00]  I just don't get it.  That's why he answers the phone.  He's afraid if he doesn't answer,  something's going to happen where she realizes what an ass she's dating.  Like the phone's ringing for her,  and she's like, why am I even with this guy?  Like he's got to distract her right away.  Oh, let me get that immediately.  He doesn't even let the ring finish.  Oh, hold on, guys.  Hello?  Oh, honey?  Is that you, darling? 
[03:39:30]  Yes, baby.  Oh, baby.  Oh, honey.  Oh, man.  Is that you?  Don't hang up.  I'm here.  You know what the sad thing is? 
[03:40:00]  When it rings, her picture comes up.  I put that into my phone.  You're kidding.  I swear to God, her picture comes up.  It's the same ring right now that you're doing.  I'm getting really scared that she's really calling right now.  Hold on, guys.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, boss, you rock.  You met her at the roast, right?  We met her at the roast, and she's a lovely girl. 
[03:40:30]  And she's funny, too.  And, you know, what are the odds?  I mean, listen, Norton's my best friend.  When me and her have sex, I definitely think of Norton's tits, right?  Boss, let me tell you something about Bonnie.  We felt guilty.  We talked about the roast the next day.  Ann and I were just looking at her boobs the whole time.  They're perfect.  And we felt kind of creepy, you know, because it's your chick and stuff.  It's your chick.  But they were, like, falling out of that dress, and she's sexy to begin with.  She was wearing something very low-cut.  You don't think I dropped a couple loads on my chest thinking of your girlfriend? 
[03:41:00]  And then I'm thinking, you know, God, she definitely saw me looking at her boobs.  I couldn't help it.  Really?  Oh, my God, dude.  She was just so hot at that thing.  Jeez, Opie, relax.  She was so ridiculously hot.  Opie just had his head in his hands going, oh, my God.  It was just like, wow.  Well, maybe you can get some his and her rollerblades and take her to Central Park.  Yeah, baby!  Don't listen to what Opie has to say. 
[03:41:30]  But it did feel like we felt like creeps.  Ann and I discussed it.  We were walking back to, you know, like 57th Street,  talking about your chick's boobs, man.  Well, you had to look at something.  You couldn't see the stage from those awful seats we got.  Oh, God.  The seats that Voss got us for that roast?  Yeah, thanks, Voss.  I'm surprised you didn't take pictures of them, Norton.  I did.  They weren't a celebrity seat.  I got pictures of how far away we were, actually.  Yeah, I got that picture, too.  We should put it up on opiananthony.com.  All right, I got it.  What's it?  It was the Donald Trump roast that we went to. 
[03:42:00]  And our seats were...  We were special guests of Rich Voss.  Yeah, and as we were going, we just had to keep walking upstairs.  Like, no one else had to go upstairs.  They were all on the floor.  There were literally like ten tables upstairs in the balcony.  No, but here's the deal.  You didn't have to be stuck amongst all those stuffy people down there.  Oh, right, and who were actually seeing the roast.  Yeah, who were we with the party people upstairs who were looking at the monitors?  God forbid we're actually in the building.  If you would have had quarters, you could have looked through one of those big viewfinders 
[03:42:30]  and saw the stage from where you were.  It could have been a Bill Cosby roast from where we were.  I had no clue.  Donald Trump?  What?  Who was that?  I wanted to hug Robert Klein.  Thank God I had enough quarters to put in the viewfinders so I could see the stage.  That's what I just said.  I know.  Thank you.  Well, okay, so I have every now and then a bad one.  Here's the deal.  You know, you're telling nothing against the wall of six.  Here's the deal.  Those, first of all, those...  Hold on, I got a call.  I got a call. 
[03:43:00]  What do you call it?  Do you know what those seeds cost at that roast?  Do you know what?  You know what?  Who's the first people I said to get into the roast?  My pal Norton, my pal Zobin Anthony, and I'll throw my family in.  I cut my sister loose to get you guys in.  Really?  Thank you.  She bothers me anyhow.  It was a lot of fun.  All right, Father.  It was all right.  All right.  I got to get back up to bed.  She's calling me.  All right.  Why don't you go back to bed?  This was a very successful call. 
[03:43:30]  Hey, do you guys want to have sex live on the show today?  What's that?  Do you want to have sex live on the show today?  Oh, it takes me an hour for the pill to kick in.  Leave with that one.  Leave with that one.  Just walk away.  Just walk away, sir.  We'll do that one day.  Really?  I will.  Of course I will.  He will.  I will.  Dude, you talk to her right now and make this happen because it will be the funniest thing  I ever hear.  Are you serious? 
[03:44:00]  Yeah, it's satellite radio.  We got a couple from California.  They're going to have sex next in a few minutes here.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  It could be really funny.  Would she be up for it?  I doubt it.  I mean, I would be, and I could fake it.  Of course you would be.  Can I just jack off on your show?  She's not into it.  You could just watch her and whack off live on the show.  That could be funny, too.  Oh, God.  Standing by the foot of the bed just jacking.  Whispering so as not to wake her. 
[03:44:30]  Roll off.  Roll over.  Jesus.  Shred and Reagan are calling soon.  They're good guys.  Hey, are you playing a bowling alley in Suffolk County next week?  Is that where I'm at?  Oh.  Hold on.  My phone's ringing.  I don't know where I'm at.  I don't know.  If they pay me my money, I'm there.  Can someone pick up my girls?  All right, Bob.  All right.  I'll talk to you guys.  If you want to call back and have sex, do that, all right? 
[03:45:00]  Put the producer on the phone.  The producer?  His name's Ben, you ass.  Oh, no.  You Hollywood ass.  Who else called me?  Huh?  Somebody else called me.  Was that Ben?  It was Eric.  Oh, it was probably Eric.  It was Eric.  Yeah.  Know the players, bro.  You've been a friend for years.  I know.  I don't know the new guy.  Put the producer on the phone.  You don't know the new guy.  I don't know the new guy.  Eric's cool.  It's Eric, Ben, and Steve.  Can I speak to Rick?  All right, Voss.  All right.  See you, Rich.  Very good.  Very good phone call from, there you go, Rich Voss. 
[03:45:30]  That was funny.  That was fun.  This is Rich Voss.  You might recognize me if you were on the train today.  You are listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  One time I was doing this thing in San Francisco, and they were all gay people in the audience,  they told me.  So I figured I'll do it.  In San Francisco?  No.  So I figured I'd do stuff about gay people so that they could relate to me.  Yeah, it's warm up.  They love that.  And so I was talking about, because I went to this gay pride parade, and I saw in it  there were these old men and old ladies with these signs that said, we are proud of 
[03:46:00]  our gay son, you know?  And so I was saying, that's an odd thing to be proud of, you know, because it's not an  achievement, you know?  It's not like something you work all your life to be gay or anything like that.  And I just wondered, I just, I had a hard time believing that these 50, 60-year-old men  are actually bragging, you know, at work, like they're, hey, Bill, you know, my kid.  Oh, my God, we're proud of him, Johnny.  He graduated from Harvard, you know, first in his class, you know what I mean? 
[03:46:30]  And now he's articling over at a law firm, and, oh, yeah, he loves cock.  He can't get enough cock in his mouth, his ass, his kid's always cock.  I got a, I got a picture of the boy here sucking another man's cock.  I want to show it to him.  So watch the maturation of you as an artist to realize it took you nine and a half minutes 
[03:47:00]  to get her out of the second cock stuff.  It's beautiful to see you comfortable in your own skin, Marmee.  All right.  This is the end.  What are you talking about?
